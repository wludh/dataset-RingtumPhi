IFC, Panhel make progress

Board impressed with headway that students have made in the alcohol policy

By Katherine Shell

ASSISTANT NEWS EDITOR

On May 6, Vishal Sapra ’06 and
Karlyn Gold ’06, heads of IFC and Panhel,
respectively, met with the Board of
Trustees. “The primary focus was to
update the Campus Life Committee on the
Gap Analysis,” says Gold. The Gap
Analysis resulted after a charge from the
Board to “find the ‘gaps’ between risk
management policy and actual practice on
this campus.” Both Sapra and Gold
presented PowerPoints related to the
current progress made towards
actualization of Greek national policies.

Gold concluded her presentation
with a “Vision for the Future” slide that
promoted a Stronger Panhellenic Spirit,
Extension, Reviewing of Risk
Management Policies, Cooperation with
IFC, and Greek Summit and Leadership
Retreat in early Fall. Several of these are
currently in place, with the process of
Extension beginning next week.

return for

By Shelley Orman

STAFF WRITER "" "

Washington and Lee’s alumni will
assemble back at school this Thursday
through Saturday for the school’s annual
Reunion ,Weekend.

The reunion will commence
Thursday evening with an assembly in Lee
Chapel, where President Burish will
deliver the keynote address. The ODK
Spring Initiation will also take place at this
assembly.

Classes in attendance will be those
who graduated in years ending in zero and
ﬁve, starting with the class of 1955 and
ending with the class of 2000. Every year
the Alumni Ofﬁce chooses two classes to
honor. This year the school will honor the
25“‘ reunion of the class of 1980 and the
50”‘ reunion of the class of 1955. While
the weekend’s events are focused on this
year’s speciﬁc reunion classes, all alumni
are invited to attend.

The Alumni House is expecting
over 1500 alumni to attend this weekend,
according to Jill Straub the office’s
administrative assistant. “We’ve been
booked for over a month,” she said.

The Alumni House takes care of all
the weekend’s details by arranging meals,
lodging, and transportation to and from all
of the events. They have reserved rooms

with all of the surrounding hotels and _

encourage alurrmi to stay with their fellow
classmates by designating speciﬁc hotels
for each class.

The Alumni Office and several
departments and organizations have
scheduled a variety of activities for alumni.
“We’ve arranged a combination of fun
things to do here in Lexington,” Straub
said.

Among the many activities that
alumni will have the opportunity to
participate in are taking a campus tour,
going on a hike, listening to presentations
given by current students, faculty and
alumni, and attending department’s open
houses and receptions.

Alumni are also encouraged to
participate in the current Strategic
Planning process. They are invited to
attend two sessions, one law and one
undergraduate, where they can discuss
their opinions and offer ideas for the
process.

The weekend’s events will
culminate Saturday night with the Alumni
Celebration on the front lawn. Alumni will
enjoy dinner and music from several
bands, including W & L- music groups
Southern Comfort, Jubilee and General
Admission. The current senior class is
invited to attend the celebration.

“Students started to realize that if we didn’t take
charge, the decisions would be made for us.”

—V|SHAL SAPRA, HEAD OF THE INTERFRATERNITY COUNCIL

Similarly to the Panhel
Presentation, Sapra’s PowerPoint detailed
the changes made this year in enforcement
and the current environment on campus.
Sapra stated that he was “happy with the
way the Board responded,” and that he
thought they were supportive of the current
steps being taken.

Both presentations were forwarded
to every Board of Trustees member to
ensure that all of the Board understands
what has gone on and what is being done.
The presentation was made to the Campus
Life Committee of the Board, which is the
direct line between student leaders and the
Board. ‘

This past weekend, members of
the W&L community gathered at
Zollman’s Pavilion for Buffalo Creek
Music Festival. Despite questions of
changes due to ﬁnancial needs, ‘‘I think
that it was successful, and Saturday
afternoon was a lot of fun,” says Ashley
Cassels 07, who attended Buffalo Creek

approved by every fraternity before they
go into action. Sapra stated that the IFC
“needed to do something,” but that a major
problem was the fact that they were
“dealing with an environment that is
resistant to change.”

The current enforcement of the
alcohol policy was a result of the IFC being
charged with fixing the problem last fall.
Sapra stated that “chapter ofﬁcers were
askedwhat they would be willing to do,”
and that they were “honest about the gaps
to the Boar .”

The Board intentionally left the
alcohol portion of the recommendation
vague so as to allow for student
involvement in every part of the process.
“Students started to realize that if we

Students enjoy the music and the atmosphere despite the rain at Zollman’s Pavilion.

Buffalo Creek does well despite concerns

last year. Security was available at the
gate for anyone who had problems, and
despite concerns of alcohol
crackdowns, everyone was able to have
fun.

Bands included Jacob’s Ladder,
Jason White w/ Jack Silverman, The
Breakfast, Jackass Flats, Wrinkle Neck
Mules, DJ Williams Projekt, and Tea
Leaf Green. Bands played Friday night,
Saturday afternoon, and Saturday night,

didn’t take charge, the decisions would be
made for us,” said Sapra.

The wristbands used sine Parents’
Weekend last fall are a solution the IFC
used to attempt to keep more with national
policies and liability issues.

The Board was encouraged the
weekend of May 6 to get out and see how
the new enforcement actually worked, and
more than one Board member was seen at
fraternity parties that weekend. The Board
was very pleased with Sapra’s
presentation, saying that it was “the first
progress they have seen in eighteen
months.” '

In response to questions as to
whether the enforcement had actually
changed things on campus or made
situations worse, Sapra stated that “we are
not close to where we need to be on any
of the three issues: alcohol, sexual assault,
and hazing,” but that the issue is more
about “balancing the level of enforcement
with keeping things on campus.” He also
said that students should not fear next Fall
being different from this Winter.

Cameron Wick 06, head of the
Buffalo Creek Committee, stated that
“the producers of the festival were all
very happy with everyone having a safe
time and enjoying the music and the
scene. We hope that the changes made‘
this year improve Buffalo Creek and
look forward to doing it again next

as

In the Monday, May 2 edition of The
Ring-tum Phi ran a letter to the editor
signed by 41 members of the faculty
entitled “Profs point to glass ceiling in
W&L Administration.” This letter
expressed concern about the management
of the University in regards to a glass
ceiling existing in Washington and Lee’s
Administration. Faculty who signed this
letter also expressed frustration with a lack
‘of progress and said, ‘women’s
contributions to Washington and Lee are
undervalued.”

The letter cited the rejection of
Dean Jeanine Stewart’s candidacy for
Dean of the College in favor of a male
Dean from Princeton as evidence of the

lack of progress. The letter also cited the
fact that of the 33 Board members, only
three are women and that only 22% of full
professors at the Law School are women
while only 15.8% of full professors in the
Williams‘School and the College are
women. Women hold only two of the 31
endowed chairs offered within the
Williams School and College. No woman
has ever held an endowed chair at the Law
School, nor has a woman ever held the
Directorship of the Frances Lewis Law
Center.

Tides turned somewhat on May 13,
when following the May meeting of the
Washington and Lee University Board of
Trustees, Dean David Partlett announced
a number of new Law School
appointments. Dorothy Brown was
chosen to succeed Blake Morant as the
next Director of the Frances Lewis Law

Center in May 2006, which was cited as a
“prestigious” position in the signed faculty
letter.

Subsequent campus discussion
following the signed faculty ‘letter
included letters from Allen Gillespie ’95
and Richard Hoover ’61 in the Trident, and
an article by Kaylee Hartung in the May 4
edition of the Trident. '

“Rather than blindly seeking and
celebrating diversity, as it appears the
faculty and administration are pre-
disposed to do, we should strive for unity,
for it is the commonality of values, ideas,
goals, and purpose that give rise to a
community and a culture,” Gillespie said
in his letter to the Trident.

The Ring-tum Phi encourages
debate and discussion of such issues so
relevant to this campus; for more student
input see Opinions page 4.

THE RING-TUM PHI 0 3

20 years...

We applaud recent events in
the faculty promotion process which
show deﬁnite progress in regards to the
alleged glass ceiling referred to in the
May 2 signed faculty letter. The law
school appointments just announced
list Dorothy Brown as the newest
Director of the Frances Lewis Law
Center. We know that the faculty hsted
this position as being one of the more
prestigious positions on campus and
bemoaned the fact that no woman had
ever been appointed. It seems that the
Board answered the faculty’s call to
“show leadership immediately and
address this crisis.”

Now that these positive steps
are being made towards the future, it is
time to turn our attention to all of the
contributions women have made during
the twenty years of coeducation on
Washington and Lee’s campus.

Since the next academic year
marks the twentieth year that women
have contributed to undergraduate life
on this campus, we believe that this
occasion should be celebrated. We
urge campus women’s groups such as
KEWL and the womens studies faculty
and students to use this year to
highlight notable Washington and Lee
women. University Administrators and
the Executive Committee should lend
these campus groups their full support

in this endavor.

Ideas for celebration include:
bring in successful female alumnae to
speak to the current generation of W&L
women. Make T-shirts, throw a party,
talk to long—time female faculty members

about the progress women have made,
start discussion about what room is left
for improvement when it comes to gender
relations on campus. Whatever we do,
we must mark this noteworthy occassion.

ByMaryChilds
IT’S NOT YOU, IT'S ME

I can honestly say that I’m shocked
at how little time is left before summer
vacation. Endings naturally bring about
reﬂections on the past, even for those of
us who are not graduating.

My best friend is one of those
people who constantly reminds me and
everyone around us what has been
accomplished in the past year. She. ﬁlled
pages and pages of my yearbook at the end
of every year recounting every adventure
that we’ve had.

One page was always devoted to
“The Warm-Fuzzy Memory List,” which
she ﬁlled with every memory she could
think of.

When I look back at these lists, I
realize just how much every year pushes
us on to the future that awaits us. Each
year, something happens that closes some
doors and opens others.

Even though we may not realize it
at the time, there is some significant
decision now that determines what
happens in the future.

I think that these events are not
speciﬁc to individuals, but also happen in
the history of institutions as well and W&L.
is no different. Lots of changes have
happened here this year. Some students,
myself included, are clinging to the
traditional symbol of the trident.

When I first read that it might be
changed, I sincerely hoped that it was an
April Fool’s joke. I love the trident as it
is, but I love what it symbolizes even more.
It’s the tradition of the university. When I
lay out on the front lawn, I feel like I could
be a student at any time in history.

I know that buildings have been
added, rebuilt, remodeled and torn down,
but when I glimpse the steeple of Lee
Chapel or the statue of George Washington
atop Washington Hall against the clear
blue sky, I feel a deep connection to the

students who have walked through the
columns since their original construction.
And I want to feel like I’ll have that same
connection to the students that will find
themselves and their futures here in the
next 100 years. ~

However, with all the changes that
have come about in the past few years, I’m
not sure that they’ll be attending the same
W&L as I am now.

Changes continue

We are in control of changes at W&L

I know that this really doesn’t have
anything to do with softening the edges
of the trident, but, nonetheless, it makes
me wonder what changes will keep the
university modern while preserving its
wonderful, traditional feel.

I think the biggest priority is to keep
the tradition of academic excellence while
maintaining an environment in keeping
with southern hospitality. As long as the
lovable essence isn’t lost, I can accept that
changes are necessary and important. I
truly believe that one of these changes was
recently expressed by concerned staff
members.

Next year marks the 20th
anniversary of the admission of women
students. But it certainly doesn’t feel like
it has been this long and the percentage of
female faculty clearly doesn’t come close
to the percentage of female students. Of
my two favorite professors, one is male
and the other is female.

I’ve had both male and female
professors ‘that I've really liked, and both
male and female professors that I didn’t
like. Both sexes clearly make great
professors, but, for some reason, females
are underrepresented here.

I’m not sure if this is due to lack of
applicants, a smaller percentage of women
who have become professors, or
discrimination.

While women may make up half the
population and cannot be considered a
minority in this respect, the letter to
President Burish, Membersof the Board
of Trustees, and the community shows that
there is still work to do before women are
equal to men on this campus.

As the feminist Charlotte Whitton
once said “Whatever women do they must
do twice as well as men to be thought half
as good.” I hope every student here feels
like they can do something to contribute
and to urge the administration to hire more
women.

After all, working for women’s
equality is not an issue that contradicts the
rights of men. Being pro-woman does not
lead to being anti—man. I feel like many
instances of under-representation are
accidental, and I certainly hope that that
is the case here.

Whatever the reason for a lack of
women faculty now, I hope it can change
in the future. We decide today what the
future holds tomorrow.

Research distracts profs  

By Chris Lauderman
CONTRIBUTING EDITOR

Professors should not be pushed
to publish. Don’t get me wrong, I am
in favornof some research. Its strength
lies in the fact that it keeps professors
fresh and up to date in their fields.
However, when it means that my
professor has to choose whether or not
he is going to teach me one—on-one so
I can grasp the material or tell me that
he can’t see me because his research
comes ﬁrst, I am no longer a supporter.
I believe most upperclassmen
would agree with me that W&L now
is not the institution that we
matriculated into three or four years
ago. This fact scares me. I have never
really bought into the argument that
W&L is forgoing its mission because
of its drive to be declared a top ten
liberal arts college by US News &
World Report.
However, I believe that we are
treading on very dangerous waters.
Teaching and student learning
should be our school’s number one
focus. That is what makes us great. I
am very glad that I chose to attend
W&L over a research university. I
would never want to go to a school
where office hours means visiting a TA
instead of talking with a professor.
Every week when I give a tour,
I tell prospective students about how

my professors are not ashamed of the label
“teacher” and that they would gladly take
time out of their extremely busy days to
help me with whatever I have needed. I
have been blessed with amazing professors
who have never turned me away.

But I don’t see how this can be the
case much longer. If we embark on a quest
to rise to the top of completely arbitrary
rankings, our professors will apparently
have to be famous for our peer institutions
to respect us, regardless of whether they
are good teachers or not.

The fact that professors are even
willing to have paren— teacher conferences
over Parent’s Weekend is astounding.
What other university in the country has a
faculty so heavily engaged in student’s
lives that they would take the time to meet
and explain college life to parents?

I think that if we are going to rise in
the rankings, we need to build from what
makes us the wonderful institution we
already are — a great faculty, deans who
interact with students, a large array of
course offerings, no TAs, and small class
sizes. The list can go on and on.

Over my past three years here, I
have come to love Washington and Lee
and what it stands for — honor, integrity,
and gentlemanly conduct. But what I love
most about W&L is what I have loved most
from the beginning: excellent teaching.

Ironically, if we take for granted our
calling to be a teaching university, we will
not only lose our niche, but also take a
dive in the coveted US News rankings.

“A lot of kids say, ‘I want to be a CSI because I like what they do on the show, and
then you tell them, ‘Well, you have to take four years of chemistry. ’And they say, ‘Oh. I
don’t wanna do that. ”’

Contact Response to Phi Staff
Editorial

The staff editorial published in
the May 9"‘ issue of the Ring Tum Phi
raised several issues that the Contact
Committee would like to address. The Phi
editorial pointed out that Contact’s
mission statement is to “appeal to as many
segments of the student body as possible.”
Contact has attempted to do this
throughout the past year.

This year alone, Contact brought or
helped to bring seventeen speakers to
campus including 2 outdoor adventurers,
2 speakers from opposite ends of the
abortion debate, a noted conservative
television show host, a universally
recognized left wing speaker and former
presidential candidate, a biographer of
George Washington, several non—partisan

speakers addressing the 2004 election, a
noted left leaning poverty lobbyistl
advocate, a speaker who discussed racial
issues, and a highly regarded defense and
homeland security expert.

This year the Committee sought to
balance the speaker lineup with various
topics and viewpoints; unfortunately, a
woman was not on the slate. The
Comrrrittee also makes its selections based
on contacts individual members have with
speakers. For example, the biographer of
George Washington was brought for a low
cost because of his being family friends
with a member of the Committee.

One problem that Contact
inevitably faces when making speaker
selections is cost and most women tend to
have higher speaking fees than their male
counterparts. For example, a woman with
as much name recognition as Ralph Nader

such as Katie Couric charges $115,000

plus first class expenses whereas Ralph

Nader (and Tucker Carlson) cost only

_ $15,000 plus expenses.

The Phi editorial made several
excellent suggestions as to speakers next
year. Two, Elizabeth Dole and Lorna
Tychostup, were both discussed for either
this year or next. Several of the Phi’s list
would cost nothing but expenses due to
their being elected ofﬁcials.

These would include Elizabeth
Dole, Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Barbara
Boxer, and Condoleezza Rice. The
problem with selecting elected ofﬁcials is
that, because they are not getting paid, they
do not hold to speaking engagements (that
is, if you can get them to schedule a school
speech) as strictly as their paid civilian
counterparts.

The rest of the list was also

composed of excellent suggestions as
reﬂected in their cost (keep in mind that
the entire Contact budget for 2004-2005
was approximately $63,000 and the entire
amount spent on our 2 keynote speakers,
Ralph Nader and Tucker Carlson, was only
$30,000), Maya Angelou— $53,000,
Christine Todd Whitman- $20,000, Paula
Zahn— $37,500, Christine Amanpour—
$50,000, Katie Couric— $115,000, Alice
Walker- $33,000 Jessica Lynch- $12,500
(Ms. Lynch only performs interviews
though, thus her appearance would not be
a practicality). ,

Dominique Dawes is $7,500 and
Carol Moseley Braun $15,000; both are
names that will receive serious
consideration for next year. As can be
seen, though, most of the other
suggestions are utterly impossible to
achieve unless the Executive Committee

chose to divert perhaps $100,000 or
more to Contact next year (hint hint).
In conclusion, the Contact
Committee would like to thank the Phi
, for working to right what many
consider to be an imbalance within the
Contact speaker slate. The Committee
promises to continue to bring the best
speakers within its limited budget
throughout the coming year. We as a
Committee encourage anyone with
suggestions for speakers to e-mail me
at kronenfeldd@wlu.edu.

Nader’s Lessons
important to all

We all can learn from Nader’s speech

By Anne Finley
THE BIG PICTURE

So last week, with the rest of the
world, I went to see Ralph Nader in Lee
Chapel. And surprisingly to me, I was
impressed by the well—spoken man who I
had expected to be a little crazy. Granted,
he might have had some more extreme
ideas to express had he actually been
allowed to discuss politics, but as it was I
found his central message to be
compelling: don’t be apathetic.

Question everything around you, all
the things that get under your skin but you
let go because you can “never change
things.” Complacency is boring — do
something about it.

It actually made me think (no, not I

about becoming a Green Party convert,
though never say never). For all of my
opinions, and all of my talk in articles like
these, can I really say I’ve inﬂuenced the
making of important changes? Can any of
us?

It is so easy not to become actively
involved with something you believe in.
Or, if you do get involved or even reach a
leadership level position, it often happens
that the big ideas you’ve formed in your
head of what should be done get pushed
back and never fully-realized. I’m
certainly guilty of this, however well-
intentioned I might have been.

Mr. Nader made me realize how
much effort a normal person can put into
something; how motivated and single-
rnindedly driven you have to be to actually

‘knows at least half of it never happens.

make things happen. In that way, he is
kind of a hero for me.

Whether or not any of us believe
with his ideas or not, he is devoted to a
cause and ﬁghts for it and you have to
respect that on some level. He ﬁghts
for the people who are too worn out
from working two jobs and raising kids
to have time to even question the
system.

Four years sounds like a long
time. But two, to my ceaseless
amazement, have already passed me by.
Maybe it is necessary for anyone with
some serious goals to accomplish in
their college life to sit down and
literally make a timetable.

Though you always imagine all
the things you’ll have time to get done
over Spring Term or Winter Break, God

We may not be in careers yet, but
I guess we have to learn to budget our
time and give ourselves deadlines if the
important stuff is actually going to get
done.

So, if you have it in you, learn
from our friendly visiting politician.
Figure out what you care about most
and ﬁght for it. Don’t expect that others
will get it done or the problems will
magically go away.

Get out of the mindset that it
isn’t “my job” or “my responsibility”
and take the initiative to strive for
whatever kind of change you are
looking for. '

Figure out what you care about most and ﬁght
for it. Don’t expect that others will get it done
or the problems will magically go away.

Dear Editor,

Given the recent discussion of
University hiring policy brought on by the
recent appointment of Dr. Howard Dobin
as Dean of the College, I felt compelled
to write to the Phi. Being a member of
the student search committee for Dean of
the College, I believe I have a special
insight into the issue. At first, I hesitated
to speak out, but a senior I have little to
lose.

As both Allen Gillespie ‘95 and
Richard Hoover ’61 discuss in recent
letters to the Trident, there seems to be a
great deal of concern that the faculty who
signed the now—ir1famous letter to the Phi
and Trident are basing their complaints off
a simplistic and small-minded interest in
numerical diversity. This view is seconded
by Dr. Jaciewicz in May 5 article by
Kaylee Hartung in the Trident. I want to
strongly question the two assumptions
that seem to be the basis of these views-

I- That the person who was hired
for the position was selected through a
lengthy search process, so he must be the
most qualified and suitable candidate.

2- That the most qualiﬁed person
for a position is usually a white male, and
if a woman or minority is hired, it must be
because he or she fulfilled some sort of
quota.

I fervently believe that these are
both false statements, and that something
has gone seriously awry in W&L’s hiring
practices.

In interviewing Dr. Dobin, I found
that he was the least knowledgeable of all
the candidates about the culture and
traditions of W&L. All of the other
candidates seemed to have researched
Washington and Lee and to be able to
provide preliminary comments or thoughts
on what the best qualities of our school
are. Dr. Jeanine Stewart, on the other
hand, was already an expert on the W&L
experience. This was not the case with
Dr. Dobin. I quote from the report I
submitted at the end of the search process:

“I am concerned that he [Dr. Dobin]
would not ﬁt well into the culture of W&L.
For example, when he posed questions to
students he was very concerned to ask us
what we did not like about W&L. While

 

I -.»*3i’&ﬁil~‘¥1A!tl!

 

some of the other candidates asked a
similar question of the students, I felt that
he was very concerned to pick apart
aspects of our school. He seemed very
skeptical about the culture of W&L. While
we do deserve scrutiny on some issues, I
did not feel that he was wholly diplomatic
in the way he went about the discussion.
He was perhaps a bit imperious and he
seemed to speak to us as an administrator
talking down to students. While I feel that
he is a creative and dynamic candidate, I
am not sure that he is the right ﬁt for W&L.
I am not sure that he would be happy here
and I think that he would step on toes...
overall I felt that he seemed unnecessarily
critical of W&L for someone who is a job
candidate. Also, I think that he would turn
students off—he really came off as a high-
rolling Ivy League administrator.”

Tell me, does this evaluation (which
is dated February 23, LONG BEFORE any
of the discussion in the newspapers) speak
of a candidate who is well-suited to the
culture of W&L? He seemed more
concerned with discussing the wonders of
Princeton than his excitement about
working at W&L. Contrast this with what
I wrote of Dr. Stewart:

“In short, I found it hard to judge
Dean Stewart against the other candidates.
The tone of our conversation with her was
much different than that with the other
candidates. Because of her knowledge of
W&L and of the position of Dean, I found
that she was able to provide much more
speciﬁc examples of certain practices and
behaviors she would like to see
encouraged. I was impressed that she did‘
not hesitate to be critical of the University
and had a distinctive vision for the position
of Dean and for the College. Further I felt
that of all the candidates she was the most
adamant about committing the University
to more diverse hiring practices, which I
thought was very appropriate. I also
thought she made a fairly good case for
why continuity would be good in the
Dean’s Ofﬁce.”

Those are the good qualities I
observed in her interview. That said, I ﬁnd
it difﬁcult to draw comparisons—since the
other candidates knew much less about
Washington and Lee, I think Dean Stewart
has a certain natural advantage and I do

 

not want to “penalize” the other
candidates for not having that. I would
say that in this process I sought for
those who seemed to have a clear
“vision” for the College. The two
candidates that most did that in my
opinion were [a third candidate] and
Dr. Stewart.”

Let me say that my status as a
feminist does not mean that I do not
want the most qualiﬁed candidate for
the position. But when I saw that Dr.
Dobin had been hired, I was absolutely
horriﬁed. I think it’s highly improbable
that the ’ search committee
recommended Dr. Dobin. I believe
instead that the search committee was
overridden because hiring him would
allow us to plaster “W&L Steals
Princeton Administrator” all over the
front page of our website.

It is a fallacy, then, that Dr.
Dobin was the most qualified
candidate. Not only is Dr. Stewart a
stronger candidate, I ranked TWO
OTHER candidates above him as well.
Of course, I hope that Dr. Dobin will
prove me wrong and become an
admirable and sensitive leader of the
College. I also wish the best to Dr.
Stewart, who in my opinion has been
treated most unfairly. I further urge
President Burish and Provost Williams
to examine their decisions closely.
What is more important? Having a
fancy news story to put on our website?
Playing in the same sandbox as
Princeton and Swarthmore? I think not.
In the twenty-first century,

W&L should be making strides
towards building its own unique
identity. We should be rejecting the
myth of the heroic outsider and
choosing the most qualified leaders for
our institution. We should be
diversifying. We should be examining
our traditions closely, keeping the best
ones, and rooting out those that may
be hurtful to our progress. Students
and faculty are at the heart of what
Washington and Lee is all about. And
in the hiring of a new Dean of the
College, their voices have been
silenced by the work of a few
administrators. I hope that this is not
the start of a new W&L tradition.

By Bree Melton
ASSISTANT LIFE EDITOR

Step back with us, across the sea to
17”‘ century Venice. Here you will ﬁnd
Kate of Shakespeare’s The Taming of the
Shrew tamed and gone leaving a self-
righteous Petruchio searching for a new
and more easily controlled wife. John
Fletcher’s The Tamer Tamed is a hilarious,
fast-paced, sexually charged account of
how Petruchio is schooled by his new wife
Maria in the proper way to treat a strong
and independent woman.

The play is staged in the classic
Shakespearean theatre form that draws
audiences from three sides into the play to
interact with and respond to the actors as
they present the story. Uproarious ﬂowery

- verse rolls over the audience laced with

subtle and not-so-subtle sexual innuendos
and allusions.

In preparation, all of the actors
participated in period movement classes
from Nona Monahin of Amherst College.
We learned how to bow, dance, andrwe
listened to Renaissance music in order to
get into character.

New to W&L theatre staff, Kimberly
Jew directs. Starring is senior Vicky
Stanham as the intelligent and quick-witted
Maria opposite freshman Charles Barbour
who plays the macho and caustic
Petruchio. Charlie Boisky graces the W&L

P stage once more hilariously portraying old

Gremio. Junior Ligia Abreu is cast as
Maria’s sweet yet scheming sister Livia,
and sophomore Michael Wagoner gives
life to her bumbling beloved. The girls’
traditional father Petronious is played by

, g sophomore Alejandro Selin. Ruth Esponda
7 leads the women of the play as the

commanding and independent Bianca,
younger sister to the late Kate.

Act I opens during Maria and
Petruchio’s wedding party. Instead of
dutifully submitting to her new husband,
Maria runs off and barricades herself in
the house. While Petruchio is off trying
to get in to his wife, three of the men make
bets on how quickly Petruchio will break
the will of Maria.

Act I also reveals the romance
between Livia and her sweetheart,

- Rowland. However it’s to Gremio, Livia’s

Spring production
pays hilarious
tribute to the Bard

wealthy and ancient suitor, that Petronious
would like to see his youngest daughter
wed. .

Much of the action in The Tamer
Tamed takes place in the upper level of
the beautiful set. In the first balcony scene
in the play, Bianca encourages Maria to
defy her husband and keep him from her
bed until he promises to treat her with
equal respect.

In the second act, Livia joins with
Bianca and Maria’s cause to stave off her
imminent marriage to Gremio, mockingly
scorning Rowland in the process.
Rowland mistakes the ruse for actual
disdain, but the gentleman Tranio sees
through it.

‘Also in Act II, the rest of the city
and country women join Bianca, Maria
and Livia in a very unladylike display.
Their rebellious actions frighten and anger
the men, but Petruchio agrees to accept
Maria’s conditions if she admits him to
the house thinking he will placate her now
and break her later.

But Act HI proves Maria is not so

’ easily taken. The first scene shows Tranio

making a bet with Rowland that not only
will he soon be in love with Livia again,
but that he, Tranio, will himself reconcile
the supposed rift between them. It turns
out that Tranio is working with Livia and
Bianca to prevent the marriage between
Gremio and_Livia and bring about the
union of Livia and Rowland. When Maria,
Petruchio and his friend Hortensio take the
stage again, Maria does her best to anger
Petruchio and prove to him that he will
not control her. She ﬂirts with Hortensio
and grants him a boon.

In response, Petruchio feigns
sickness to try and gain sympathy from
Maria. She responds by acting as if he
has the plague and will die, locking him
in the house and removing all their

STEVEN MARINOS / PHOTO EDITOR

‘ ‘Tamer’ opens May 20

belongings. Busting out of the house after
everyone has run off in fear of catching
his illness, Petruchio roars that once more
Maria has gotten the better of him.

Act IV opens with Petronious and
Gremio agreeing on a marriage contract.
Maria and Petruchio confront each‘ other
once more, he graciously offers to forgive
her because he does truly love her. She
endures his yelling, but when he threatens
to hit her, Maria will not stand for it.
Tranio, Bianca, and Livia are found
plotting still.

This time Bianca coaches Livia to
pretend to be ill and accept the marriage
with Grerriio, promising that all will work
out in the end. Hortensio tries to help
Maria and Petruchio reconcile as he can
tell that they still love each other, but
neither is willing to compromise with the
other.

In the ﬁnal act, Bianca provides the
marriage contracts that are supposedly for
Gremio and Livia, but Rowland and
Petronious also sign as witnesses.
Rowland is distraught thinking he is
witnessing his love being turned over to
old Grerriio. But Tranio announces that
Rowland has lost his bet with him and bids
him examine the marriage contract he
signed. Thus Rowland discovers that it is
he who is married to Livia, not Grerriio.

As Petruchio’s servants prepare to
set sail with him, Hortensio enters
armouncing that all the ﬁghting with Maria
has killed their master. All enter mourning
over Petruchio’s body, but Maria does not
repent the way she treated him, only is sad
that it had to end like it did. Hearing this,
Petruchio leaps up as he was only feigning
death. He begs Maria to explain to him
why she treated him so poorly. To which
she responds, “I have done my worst, and
have my end: I’ve tarn’d ye, And now am
vow’d your servant.”

Thus the play ends: everything as it
should be. So much work and care has
been put into this production, and it should
prove to be a very exciting ride. It opens
Thursday night at 8 in the Johnson theatre.
Of the play Charles Barbour says, “I am
stoked!!!” Performances run May 20, 21,
23, 24 at 8 pm and May 22 at 2 pm. For
tickets, call the box ofﬁce (x8000). Cheer
wench!

Lexington and sushi

Never the two shall mix well?

By Marshall Rule
MANAGING EDITOR

There are many words in the
English dictionary that are ﬁne on their
own but should never go together.

“Warm” and “natty” should not go _

together. “Rain” and “Buffalo Creek”
is not a good combination. “W&L
basketball” and “win” do not go well
together. .
“Lexington” and “sushi” fall
under this category.

Lexington, on its own, is a ﬁne
thing. While the town is quite boring
at times, it is also ﬁlled with beautiful
scenery. And when it comes down to
it, there are plenty of things to do if
you are creative enough to look for
them.

Sushi, on its own, is a brilliant
thing. Possibly the best food ever
invented by man (if you don’t think
about what you are eating), sushi has a
special place in my heart.

However, Lexington and sushi
are not things that should mix.

Many people living in
Rockbridge County moved here from
bigger cities in order to escape to the
quiet country life. Many of these
people probably know good sushi and
have eaten it on many occasions.

However, for some reason, I am a little
skeptical about sushi prepared in
Lexington.

Raw meat is not something that
should be played around with,
especially by a 16 year old in aWizards
basketball jersey who prepared my
sushi when I went to Lexington’s lone
sushi restaurant the other day. I don’t
think 16 year old kids from Lexington
make veiy authentic sushi.

While the sushi was fairly good,
especially considering the source, you
could still never pay me enough money
to eat the sushi that the co-op sells on
select days for lunch. Something about
day old sushi from Lexington makes
me a little nauseous. I can’t eat the
food in the Dining Hall without
needing my stomach pumped, much

less am I going to try the sushi.

But the real problem about my
sushi outing the other day was the
quality of service. This seems to be a
reoccurring theme in Lexington
restaurants, but I have never had worse
service anywhere than I did at the sushi
place on Saturday night.

It took us at least ﬁve minutes to
even be acknowledged, and another
five to get our menus. After finally
ordering four waters and a Pepsi, we
had to go up to remind them about the
drinks 10 minutes later. After 20
minutes, we still weren’t even asked
what we wanted to eat.

After 35 minutes in the
restaurant, we were ﬁnally able to order,
but of course, to continue with the
theme of the outing, the food took
forever to arrive.

At first we thought we were just
unlucky. Maybe the “waiter that
wanted to be an actor” just kept
forgetting about our table. But then we
realized that we were actually getting
the best service of any one in the place.

The group of three guys that had
ordered before we had even arrived got
their food ten minutes after ours.

It’s kind of sad to think that
restaurants are able to treat customers
like pet dogs just because we don’t have
any alternative places to eat. Any
Lexington restaurant would not be able
to survive in any bigger city.

This attitude towards customers
(especially college students), is quite
annoying to me. I like to think that
Washington and Lee helps the town as
much as the town helps us, but I think
that the relationship is a little one sided.

Business skyrockets for local
stores and restaurants during Parents’
Weekend and Graduation. In the sushi
restaurant the other day, there were
about six tables occupied, ﬁve of those
tables were taken by W&L students,
and the other by a Keydet and his
family.

I am not looking for special
attention, just some common decency.

A How—to on Spring Term
Breka explains the do’s of Spring

By Bree Melton and Eka Akpakip
BREKA

This campus has got spring fever
and the only prescription is MORE
COWBELL! ! But no, seriously. . .people
are breaking up, hooking up, and then
shacking up, but to what end? There are
only two weeks left in school so now is
the time to ﬁgure out your summer plans.
Eka is completely of the school of thought
that: Who needs spring ﬂings?

It’s time for summer ﬂings! Going
away for the summer is usually the perfect
time to meet that special-for-just—three—
months someone. Real relationships can
wait.

So one way to look at spring ﬂings
is: hit up the seniors! If they’re not already
in a serious relationship that will lead to
marriage, all they want is to get a little
action before branching out into the “real
world.” And all you want is a guy that’s
21. Sooooo convenient.

The prime choice is that senior who
just broke up with his long time girlfriend
in anticipation of graduation. He’s alone,
maybe just a little sad, and definitely in
need of some spring lovin’. He also

probably doesn’t want to start anything
serious, but then neither do you!

With a lighter spring term
load, you definitely have time for this.
And considering the serious lack of
parties this past term, you really don’t
have too much of an opportunity to meet
a ton of random hook—ups. ,

Let’s face it - having a consistent
one is just easier and most economically
efficient. Yeah, that’s right, we paid
attention in 101. I

So we also know the meaning
of opportunity cost. That guy you met
at Buffalo Creek? Say something to
him! You never know what could
happen. If you don’t exchange phone
numbers or don’t ask him on a date, you
could miss out on initiating something
you could come back to in the fall. Plant
the seed in his head now, so when he
returns next semester he’s had you on
his mind all summer!

Breka’s advice for the
remainder of the term is to seize your
opportunities. The beautiful weather
giving you that added energy, how can
you wait? Be frisky, be daring, take the
chance! What do you have to lose?

Going away for the summer is usually

. the perfect time to meet that special—for-

just—three—months someone.

 

Pet peeves galore

By Kristine Early
THE MILK AND CHEESE G|RL

You sleep through your alarm and
miss English class- for the fourth time in
a row. You get a test back in Calculus, and
needless to say, you didn’t do quite as well
as you expected. You manage to spill your

» drink all over your brand new outﬁt at

lunch. You almost trip up the stairs in the
Commons. Give up. It’s just one of those
days. Maybe it’s just one of those weeks.
Don’t fight it. Be bitter. Find the bad in
everything. Vent your frustrations at the
minutiae in life, like:

1) Tortilla chips without salsa. It’s
like pie without ice cream, completely
sacrilegious.

2) PDAs. Unless the Milk and
Cheese Girl is personally involved.

3) People who wear spandex to the
gym. It doesn’t look good on anyone. In
fact, it should be outlawed.

4) Having to wait in line to get to
the keg. We need our beer, and the clock
is ticking.

5) People who cut in line at the keg.
We need our beer, and the clock is ticking.

6) Glassketchup bottles. Seriously,
they’re way too much work. ,

7) Purple and green ketchup.
Sometimes companies get a little too
creative.

8) Country music. It should be
outlawed right along with spandex.

9) The death of the speaking
tradition. Really, how hard is it to smile
and say “hi”?

10) People that have long
conversations on their cell phones in
public. ,

11) Over-attentive waiters. When
my glass is ten—elevenths full, I really don’t
need any more to drink.

12) Under—attentive waiters. (Can
you really win with me?)

13) People who take life too
seriously.

14) Unﬁnished to-do lists.

15) People who block the aisles at
Wal—Mart with their carts or their girth.

16) When all the elliptical machines
are in use at the gym.

17) Unidentified meat at the
Marketplace. Is that pork or beef?

18) Pop~up ads. I’m sure you
already have a fine porn collection.

19) Being woken up from a nap. It’s
my personal ultimate pet peeve.

-.x/'

20) Spam. Actually, if you met the
type of person who would buy Rogaine
or ehem.. enhancement products on-
line, you’d probably feel a bit better
about your own life.

21) Telemarketers.

22) People who forget to put

away messages up. Okay, call me a
voyeur, but even “Away” leaves me
more satisfied the “Idle.”

23) Cold coffee. It may be worse

I than warm beer.

24) People that make comments
throughout the entire movie. Okay,
that’s me. But I try to be discreet. Throw
popcorn at me and I’ll shut up.

25) When your teacher says
something to the likeness of: “Well, I
don’t think we’re going to have time to
discuss Precipitate Effects on the
Mechanical Behavior of Aluminum
Copper/llloys, so you don’t have to read
it if you didn’t get a chance to last
night.” Hey, if you had to suffer through
that thirty—page masterpiece, so should
everyone.

26) Leaving a restaurant and
smelling like smoke for the rest of the
night. ‘

27) Lugging all your laundry (two
months worth) down three ﬂights of
stairs only to discover that all the
washers are full.

28) Realizing right after the door
closes that you left your key card on top
of your desk.

29) Overbooked airplane ﬂights.

30) Weather that goes from
reasonably warm to freezing cold to
scorching hot all within a three—hour
time span. Hmrnrn...I wonder where
that happens?

31) Having to limit your thoughts

to five pages, double-spaced. Or having ‘

to expand your thoughts to ﬁve pages,
double-spaced.

Being resentful isn’t easy.
Whenever you are tempted to think-
“Wow, look at how beautiful the world
is! The sun is shining. I’m in good
health. I have lots of caring supportive
friends and a loving family. I’m at one
of the best schools in the entire country.”
— you need to suck it up and resist. Refer
to my list for a little help. After all, being
melancholy and depressed is so hot right
now.

Be bitter. Find the bad in everything. Vent your
frustrations/at the minutiae in life, like Tortilla

Hugh’s soul:

Irate: Paris Hilton

Paris and The Fisherman were meant to be together

By Hugh Trout
THE FISHERMAN

It is rare in life that one finds their
soul mate, a person that truly understands
you on the most basic and intimate level.
I am lucky enough to have found that
person and her name is Paris Hilton.

While we may not look all that
much alike (the common theme is that we
are both attractive and classy), we are truly
the same soul in two different bodies. I
can only give the overwhelming evidence
that supports my claim. Allow me to
explain.

First, we both enjoy the nightlife.
Yes, there may be others who would claim
the same, but no one is as brazenly
dismissive of responsibility in everyday
life as we are in our mutual devotion to
“living the dream.”

She enjoys rocking it straight street,
I define it. She enjoys being dismissive
of common problems that we all must deal
with, I am about to fail out because of
that. She has a sex tape that has been
released, mine comes out next week. She
enjoys living in a large city, and
I. . .ok. . .maybe we are a little different.

For example, she is sort of into that
whole “I’m a rich blonde whorish
princess” look where as I rock the “I’m
an irresponsible frat boy in need of a
haircut who thinks Salemo’s is a luxurious
meal and a 30—pack of Bud Light should
be considered fine wine.”

That is more of a taste thing, but we
really are the same at heart. She displays
a glorious rejection of anything that could
be recognized as a goal, dream, or thought.

Anyone who could so brazenly
dismiss the common responsibilities that
we all are expected to assume is a friend
of mine. But anyone who could so
effectively do nothing, and I mean nothing,
is a soul mate of mine.

‘ I’m pretty sure it was Gandhi that
said “accomplishing things is for suckers.”
Actually, I may have dreamed that, but it
seems like something Gandhi would have
said if he had thought of it.

If there is one thing that I have
learned in this life, it’s that if you stop
worrying about things, either they go away
or someone else will step up for you and
take care of it. This is what many like to
call “working the system.”

If you want to be more like me and
Paris, you need to change the way you live
your life, but that’s actually a much simpler
thing to do than one might think.

All you have to do is get up in the
morning (when you feel like it, alarm
clocks are only a smaller form of torture),

and stand in front of a mirror and say the
following: “I am a good looking person
and I deserve to get what I want from
everyone else because I’m me and no one
else. is.” I

There may be those who get in your
face with “hey, that’s not fair” or “you are
horribly irresponsible and need to grow up
and recognize that you must do things for
people other than yourself,” but all you
need to do is, in the words of one of my
good friends, “Brush your shoulders off.”

We can even see Presidents
exhibiting such behavior. The most
obvious example is our current Republican
wonder-hero. W has needless to say
brushed off many people who have
claimed he has misled us or has been
irresponsible.

Clinton lived more of a party life in
the Oval Office than the Red Hot Chili
Peppers, and he still has tons of fans to
this day.

So remember, the next time
someone asks you to do something, say,
“is this what Paris Hilton would do?”.

Anyone who could so brazenly dismiss
the common responsibilities that we all are
expected to assume is a friend of mine.

Students prove susceptible to attacks

By Erin Julius and Leah Kershaw
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF AND STAFF WRITER

Two local men have been charged
in connection with crimes against
Washington and Lee students.

Mike Young, W&L’s director of
security, said the two men are formally
charged in connection with the recent car
robberies that occurred at the Pole Houses.
The Rockbridge County Sheriff informed
W&L security that the two men had been
charged and that stolen belongings had
been recovered on Friday, said Young. The
Rockbridge County Sheriff’s office
conﬁrmed that both men had been taken
into custody.

Young said he suspects that the two
men were also involved in the assault of a
Washington and Lee. student early
Thursday morning. David Mitchell, a
sophomore, was trying to flag down a
Traveller car near “County Seat” when he
was attacked. Mitchell said two men came
up from behind him. One sprayed him in
the face with a chemical, similar to mace,
and the other struck him in the back of the
head. The two men then ﬂed the scene.

Mitchell said he ﬁled a report with
the Rockbridge County Sheriff on
Thursday.

Another incident occurred Saturday
night when a group of five men attacked
Washington and Lee student David Seifert

 

“It’s important for all students

to remember that bad things can
happen in Lexington and we
need to remember to take the

necessary precautions.”

—'KELLY JO LARSEN, W&L STUDENT ‘05

as he was walking up Henry St. and turning
on to Randolph St. Seifert said that the
men were yelling vulgar comments at his
companion, Liz Lane. He said they tried
to ignore the comments, but the men
stopped them, pushed Lane out of the way
and started punching Seifert in the face.

“I tried to defend myself but I was
surprised by it,” Seifert said.

Lane called the police while the
men were punching Seifert. After she told
the men that the police were on their way,
the five men ran away. An ambulance
arrived with the police to take Seifert to

the hospital. The two students have ﬁled

a police report but have not notified
Washington and Lee security.

In addition to the string‘ of recent
attacks, a peeping tom has been harassing
female Washington and Lee students.
Kelly J o Larsen, Kristen Brown and Annie

Rochfort, who live at the corner of
Randolph and Massie, came home one
night about a week ago to police pounding
on their door. The police informed the
students that one of their neighbors had
called and reported seeing a man on the
women’s roof.

‘This is complicated by the fact that
our living room and two bedrooms have
skylights in them,” said Larsen.

This peeping tom apparently has a
habit of spying on the women.

“A week earlier my roommates had
thought they had heard a man on the roof
but we didn’t do anything about it,” Larsen
said. “We’re rational and when you hear
things you don’t think much about them.”

The students have not reported the
attack to Washington and Lee security and
thepolice have not caught the peeping
tom.

“The police were very nice and told
us to call if we ever thought anything was
wrong,” Larsen said.

Thispeeping torn is not the first to
harass Washington and Lee women.
Around February, the five women of
“Utah” on North Randolph Street
discovered that someone had set up a
ladder to the roof of their house.
According to Katharine Lester, one day the
women’ found footsteps in the snow and
called the police. Police moved the ladder,
told the women to lock their doors and
windows, and promised the women that
they would watch the house. The women
have not had a problem since.

In light of the recent crimes, Young
said he urges students to be more careful.
“Although Washington and Lee security
can’t protect you all the time, we are trying
to keep you as safe as possible,” said
Young.

Students certainly need to be more
aware of their surroundings following
these various reports of attacks and
harassment of Washington and Lee
students. ‘

“Everyone always thinks these
things don’t happen in Lexington,” Larsen
said. “Recent events have highlighted the
fact that we don’t actually live in a bubble.
It’s important for all students to remember
that bad things can happen in Lexington
and we need to remember to take the
necessary precautions,” she said.

Alumni descend on Lex

Class of 1955 donates over $2 million to its alma mater

By Katherine Shell
ASSISTANT NEWS EDITOR

This past weekend, the classes of
1955, 1960, 1965, 1970, 1975, 1980.
1985, 1990, 1995, and 2000 made their
way to Lexington for Alumni Weekend.
Events such as luncheons, assemblies,
tours and banquets entertained the alum
for the majority of the time. Also, with
various band parties and cocktail parties,
undergraduate students and alumni were
able to reunite for the last weekend of the
year.

Valerie Delaune ’O7, a member of
Kathekon, stated that “we enjoyed, having
the alums in town this weekend, and hope
they had a wonderful time meeting

“It was very
comfortable
being on campus.

“It was very comfortable being on
campus,” says Chris Surdo ’04, back for

his first alumni weekend. “The students

made the alums feel very welcome.”
Events were planned by various classes
and groups on campus to show the
returning alumni new buildings and plans.
The administration held an assembly
dedicated to informing the alumni about
the Strategic Planning currently being
discussed on campus, giving the alumni
“the opportunity to hear about current
suggestions, voice their opinion of these
ideas, and contribute their own ideas into
the process,” according to the Alumni
Website.

The class of 1955 gave over two
million dollars to the university in honor

of their ﬁftieth reunion, and the class of ’

1980 gave a full scholarship honoring a
classmate who died the_ﬁrst week of their

STAFF WRITER

Students who wish to take one
of Washington and Lee’s most popular

have to travel outside of Lexington if
the class continues to be offered.

This change is a result of the
closing of Lexington’s only bowling
alley, Lexington Lanes.

- A notice on the door of the alley
reveals that the center closed at
midnight on May 16. The sign
indicates that the bowling alley closed
because of financial reasons and
corporate dissolution.

Lexington Lanes’ closing will
affect more than people who just like
to bowl. Organizations like the Special
Olympics Bowling and Washington
and Lee’s PE class will have to adjust
as well.

There are currently 146 students
on the wait-list for Bowling 149 who
will be affected by this change.
Sophmore Mallory Calhoun said, “I
wouldn’t travel an hour to take a
bowling PE class because my
schedule’s already so full anyway.”

Students who do want to go
bowling can travel to one of the ﬁve
bowling alleys located within an hour
from Lexington.

Staunton Bowling Lanes and
Thunder Alley, which is located in
nearby Covington, Va., are both a forty
minute drive away. They can also try
Char1ottesville’s AMF Kegler Lanes,
which is open seven days a week and
has 48 lanes. AMF Hilltop Lanes in
Roanoke and Lee-Hi Lanes in Salem
are just over an hour away.

Warner will be presented with an

“It has been the core values of the

our revered honor code, that I have turned

to at times_in my life when I have had to
make difﬁcult decisions,” said Warner. “I
consider that honor code to be my anchor.
I have reached for that anchor often, and
have found its strength to be both
reassuring and inspirational.”

“It is altogether fitting that
Washington and Lee University, which has
long prided itself on dedication to service,
should be honoring one of its own for his,"

I‘i‘SM)TYC1J.|'!"sNE

Well, if you couldn’t tell by my last
two (or so) articles, plus that one that they
gave to me that I didn’t write, the
inspiration for these articles has been a bit
lacking. So when my old friend Torn
Lovell of the alumni department — I’m
telling you, I have some pretty weird
connections — approached me at lunch
today, he was all, “why is everything you
write in the Phi negative?” Negative, is
it? 1 have very little idea of what I’ve been
publishing here, apparently. Perhaps its
been lackluster or hypocritical at best. So
I told him, well, Tom, this is how it is: I
got nothing to write about. Any
suggestions? And he said he’d think on it.
And I was expecting some Tom Lovell e-

discussing the importance of a beard when
chaperoning children — to assert your

Down wit

ByBeckyl.dVlo'ne

Tl-ELERALVEW

By now, it seems that I have
established myself as the one of the most
offensive Phi writers. The irony lies in the
fact that I have offended everyone, at one
point or another. So, to end the year in a
similarly offensive fashion, I would like
to examine an issue that could collectively
insult every type of person, including
myself: People who are elitists about their
tastes in pop culture.

What defines a “pop culture elitist”?
I believe there are two separate categories
of elitists. For convenience and clarity,
these categories—will;be.,deﬁned in terms
of music. The first is the elitist who refuses
to recognize the artistic or musical value
of any form of music other than the form
he/she confines himself/herself to.

The second is the elitist who feels
he/ she is superior to other people who like
the same form of music, with reasons for
this superiority varying from length of
devotion to a particular band or singer to
the amount of useless trivia known about
a band or singer. In both cases, the elitist
wishes to establish his/her superiority over
others simply based on tastes in pop
culture.To some degree, I think we are all
the ﬁrst type of elitist. For most of us, there
is at least one genre of music or one
particular band or singer that we refuse to
recognize as worthy of our listening. For
me, that singer is Ashlee Simpson. For
you, it might be Marilyn Manson or Garth
Brooks or Britney Spears or Dave
Matthews or  the list goes on and on.

_ However, there is a difference between

having the opinion that a band is terrible,

Street. But I gotta tell you, Tom surprised
me.lHe really came through this time. I
was in mid—conversation with people my
age, you know, freshmen, when Tom
comes over and says hey, c’mere,_I’ve got

. an article for you. My friends looked at

me kind of weirdly that I was being
summonsed by this random guy, but I had
faith in Tom and I followed. He led me to
a table of alumni brimming with ideas for
an article, and — you know this is coming
— love for their old stomping grounds.

Now I was caught completely
unawares that alumni even read my
article. That’s a pretty awkward realization
to have in the middle of a sea of alumni. I
didn’t even know about that whole
constituency - I guess it should have
occurred to me, but I missed it. But these
alumni had read my articles and were more
than willing to contribute. And they
couldn’t help but wonder. . .Why do
alurrmi froth at the mouth so about their
beloved Washington and Lee, and why by
extension, why do they come back at every
chance they get?

Now Washington and Lee is a
small school, and we’ve been a small
school for a while now. And the obvious
answer to why its alums are so in love,
still, after all these years, is that there are
only so many of us to love. YOU went to
W&L?? I went to W&L!! Tl1at’s amazing! !
And we could stop there and think that
that’s why we’re all so in love with each
other, because it’s like a little piece of our
darling W&L come to talk to us.

But my friends at the table and I
thought it was perhaps more than just that.
This passion for W&L and this avid desire
to return for Parent’s Weekend (whether
or not you have a kid there. . . ..) and Alumni
Weekend is evidence that W&L is doing
something right (oh my God, a positive
article by yours truly. And oh my God,
something positive about W&L in a
newspaper. It’s a big day on both fronts).
Through all the years, and all the various
administrations trying to make us
Davidson and trying to bend such a
wonderful University to whatever Dean’s
evil will, Washington and Lee has proven

pop culture elitists

and being elitist about your music choice.
Having an opinion usually denotes
that you have at least listened to a
substantial amount of the band’s music,
and still think it lacks talent. Being elitist
means that you do not like a band simply
based on one song, an image, or
reputation. In other words, you would not
dare descend from your lofty pedestal to
give a chance to something you consider
so shallow and dissonant. I am this way
about Ashlee Simpson, and each of you
are probably thesame way about another
band or singer. Just ﬁll in the blank: “I
would never be caught dead listening to
________.”The second type of elitism is
what really bothers me. These are the
people who say, “I’m a bigger fan because
I liked them way back when, when nobody
knew who they were!” This is just
ridiculous. The circumstances that lead us
to like a band are different for each.
Maybe you didn’t start liking your
favorite band until a certain event made
you start associating one of their songs
with that special memory. Maybe it was
when you saw the band in concert. Maybe
it was when you first listened to an entire
album. There are countless reasons why
you could have started liking a band later

‘than someone else. Don’t get me wrong;

being with them from the beginning could
certainly mean that you are a more devoted
fan. It just seems absurd to use this fact to
assume your superiority over another
fan.The same argument can be made for
people who think that your devotion to a
band can only be measured by how much
money you spend buying their products,
how often you have seen them in concert,
and how much useless knowledge you

know about the band. While all of these
facts could certainly indicate that you are
a more devoted fan, there are always
circumstances in which this would not be
true. For example, someone who is too
poor to simply go out and buy every Elvis
artifact in existence is not necessarily less
of a fan than the rich person who can easily
afford to spend thousands on an extensive
Elvis collection.

In general, competition over who is
the bigger fan seems a. petty means of
establishing that only you have the right
and deserve to enjoy that particular music;
in essence, that the music can only be
special for you, because you have a closer
connection with it than anyone else. Yet, I
think that most artists would appreciate any
well-intentioned listeners, even if those
listeners had not heard of the band until
one of their songs hit the radio, did not
have a huge collection of their
memorabilia, and could not boast of
having been to at least twenty of their
concerts. Having differing opinions and
differing tastes is what makes us individual
beings. Though we may not like a certain
band, we should at least respect others who
see the beauty in their music. Additionally,
though we may feel as though we are the
only ones entitled to like our favorite band,
we should at least respect others for
recognizing, in whatever means possible,
the talent we have loved all along.

I don’t think there is anything wrong
with being a pop culture elitist, as long as
you don’t disrespect others for not being
on the same page as you. If we begin to
deride and demean everyone for their tastes
in pop culture, we may get more than what
we wished for... a homogeneous society.

“semper ubl sub ubi”

itself amazingly resilient. Despite
changing laws and regulations, we still
partake in the same fundamental activities
and despite the changing face behind the
Colonnade, the real stuff that makes up
our University has remained unchanged
and will probably, based on the
enlightening and reassuring comments of
our forerunners, be there for us to make
our pilgrimage to kneel before the tomb
of Lee and walk in the shadows of white
columns. So there’s hope yet, as my alumni
friends indicated to me — because in their
day, they too had the Phil Walotskies
(sorry, Phil, I had to make it plural — I know
how to spell it) v. the Dean Watkinses, and
here we continue to wage that battle with
the full knowledge — or hope — that we’re
fighting the battle for show and we all
understand that nobody, not nobody but
Lee himself, could ever change this school
from what it is and what Lee meant it to
be.

And while that would have been a
good place to end, I have one more point.

While we were discussing how rabid these

Bysaabuckworlh

FIHEHIJDKE

What is there to say really? The
school year is drawing to a close and
some of my best friends are graduating.
I’m excited for them and they’re going
to some great places. They have also
all made the foolish mistake of inviting
me to come visit. They’re going to
graduate schools and getting real adult
jobs. In high school, graduation was
always exciting, because everyone was
going off to college and experiencing
that first true sense of freedom. There
was a sense of assurance that at the end
of May everyone would come back

" homeland swap all of their “awesome”
stories about all the “awesome” parties
they went to with all of their
“awesome” new friends.

Sadly, that adult world does not
include summer vacation, nor does it
mean everyone coming back to Big Lex
at the end of the year. Thank goodness
for cell phones.

To be honest, I’m glad I have one
more year before it’s my head on the
chopping block, even though everyone
I meet has started to ask what exactly

alumni are, Lee Hollis and Barry Barlow
(two of my table buddies) commented that
when a graduate leaves W&L, it’s not just
a piece of paper with a signature to hang
up. We leave here as shareholders in this‘
ﬁne institution — there will never be a point
in our lives when we are not closely tied
to the “cult” of W&L. When we return,
it’s a check-up to ensure that Lee would
smile upon our progress and call us
Gentlemen (and women).

Maggie Olgivie, class of ’97, added
that it’s a part of our duty — a result of our
honor code that is so drilled into us. As
graduates, W&L is a part of us forever and
the yearly journey to pay homage is also
an acceptance of that responsibility to
uphold and maintain the University as it
has been and as it should be.

And under the ‘watchful stone eyes
of General Lee (and I shouldn’t neglect
Washington) and the guiding hand of our
friendly and rabid alumni, Washington and
Lee will continue to battle itself to keep

itself. And the odds there are pretty good ’

that W&L will come out on top.

Farewell to class of 2005

I’m doing with the rest of my life. Telling
them that I’m desperately waiting to get
interviewed for my MRS degree doesn’t
seem to suit (and if you know me that
really is a joke). My mother’s face turns
an interesting shade of white every time I
mention social worker. My grandmother,
is positive I was just kidding about not
going to medical school, but sadly, I still
don’t want to take the MCAT — or Organic
for that matter. My father’s Christmas
letter included a plea to all of his fraternity
brothers to ﬁnd me a job. The people in
Career Services may get incredibly tired
of me, but I’ll ﬁgure it out. Senior year
looks to be exciting and it never hurts to
be the oldest ones on the totem pole. Just
think: Ihave successfully picked a major,
managed to finish all of my GenEds
without taking any classes I hated and
could still write a thesis. I still get one
more year of “playing” adult in my off
campus house and attending class instead

of a job from which I could get fired from

for being 5 minutes late.

Soto sum up: I am thankful to not
yet have Senioritis as I am not yet a Senior
and I am going to miss my dear friends a
lot when they venture forth into that world
that thankfully remains somewhat foreign
to me.

French p ay
absurd, but
charming

By Dane Boston‘
STAFF WRITER

Audiences Wednesday and
Thursday nights were treated to a truly
surreal experience. French 342
presentedgLe Jardin de délices by
Fernando Arrabal and the two play
series Jacques ou la Soumission and
L’avenz'r est dans les ouefs by Eugene
Ionesco.

The plays took a brief glance into
the development of French theatre after
the discoveries of Sigmund Freud and
amidst the confusion and moral
bankruptcy felt by many young artists
in the interim between the world wars.

In the first play, Arrabal’s Le
Jardin, an extraordinary cast of
characters bring to symbolic life the
desires and conflicts of the main
character.

Altemately played to perfection
by Paten Hughes and Kathryn George
(and in her childhood form by Maria
Blackwell), the sensual, artistic Lais
experiences a strong desire to break
free from the constraints of her unique
childhood. Lais was raised by nuns and
oscillates between outright rebellion
from their strict rules and a desire to
reclaim her lost innocence.

The rebellion manifests itself
particularly clearly in Lais’s argument
with God, during which she decides to
follow her ambitions to fruition, and
her innocence is brought to life by a
helpless ﬂock of sheep she must feed
and defend.

The outrageous panoply of
characters that Lais confronts in her
journey through life include the nun
Miharca, played by Alex Mahoney,
Zénon the malleable, gentle savage
played by Robert Armstrong, and the
enchanting prince—charming who
carries his heart in a curio cabinet
strapped to his chest, played by John
Harcus.

This exceptionally strong
supporting cast makes more lucid the
many abstract concepts communicated
in the ‘play. Added to their numbers is
the rotating corps of broadcasters and
talk show hosts which embodies the
empty consrunerism of the modern age.

All three plays complement each
other exquisitely, and were performed
ﬂawlessly. The accents of the actors
and actresses convinced this very
average French student, and the
enthusiasm and conﬁdence with which
each and every participant played his
or her part was refreshing.

Bravo to the French 342 class
and director Domnica Radulescu and
hearty thanks for bringing a little
absurdity to Washington and Lee.

hough it may have
taken the audience a
while to get the hang
of the Shakespeare-
like dialogue, the cast
of “The Tamer
Tamed” had won the
hearts (and, more
importantly, the laughs) of every
theatergoer by the end of the show.

The play itself is a sexually charged
and quick witted battle of the sexes, which
ultimately allows the feminists to take the
upper hand.

At some point, the storyline
becomes unbelievable — perhaps when all
the women in the entire city revolt against
their husbands? .

The plot takes the same predictable
twists over and over again and ends
abruptly without much explanation as to
the “why” and “how” that it all worked
out.

The director’s notes in the program
request forgiveness for this ending,
admitting the faults and arguing that “all’s
well that ends well.” Sorry, but that just
doesn’t offer much comfort after a less-
than—satisfying wrap to the plot.

Just the same, the show managed
to keep us entertained with the ridiculous
escapades that would have made you feel

   
 

like a giddy child again, were it not for

the strongly suggestive script.
On the whole, the acting was

convincing — I have no complaints‘-other ‘

that one or two need to lose the modern
vocal inﬂections.

Senior Victoria Stanham proved a
perfect match for the strong-willed Maria,
who manages to connect with the
audience by putting everyone at ease and
interacting freely with them. Her
performance was full of surprises, and she
earned every laugh with her exaggerated
expressions.

Charles Barbour, the tamed
Petruchio himself, delivers another high-
energy performance that has become
typical of his roles so far this year.

Dr. Jew and cast pull Off an amazing
show that keeps us laughing

A STEVEN MARINOS / F-Ho'ro Emma
Rowland (Michael Wagoner) tries to win back the love of
Livia (Ligia Abreu) after she takes up the feminist cause
with other rebellious wenches in “The Tamer Tamed.”

Ruth Esponda’s Bianca stands up

well as the independent leader of the
wenches, effortlessly offering the ideal
amount of both poise and authority to the
character.

Ligia Abreu and Michael Wagoner
play the forbidden lovers, who bring in
an entirely new melodramatic aspect to
what had until that point been mostly quick
wit.

It’s a well—timed shift that lets our
brains rest a little and feeds us some cheap
but gratifying laughs.

But the collective castfs chemistry
absolutely made the play.

Every member of the audience
could easily see the actors were enjoying
themselves up there, especially in scenes
where the women hold a revolution and
resort to hurling fruit and pillows at the

, men from the balcony high above.

The details of costumes and props
were meticulously designed, and the set
was exquisite and quite convincing as a
Venetian terrace, complete with a genuine
fountain.

Interesting choice of theater, too —
at first, I was a little surprised they didn’t
use the Keller for its size. But after seeing
it, the Johnson proved an ideal choice for
its versatility and intimacy, which aided
the connection with the audience that the
actors sought to achieve.

Director Kimberly Jew presents this
show as her directorial debut on the W&L
stage. Her resume explains a lot — she’s
got some notable experience under her
belt, and it shows in her handiwork.

At the same time, Jew should be
commended for allowing her actors the
freedom to take risks and liberties with
their roles. They all seemed to come into
their own for this performance, making the
audience feel as comfortable during the
show as the actors seem on the stage.

I certainly recommend the show -
deﬁnitely a success for Dr. Jew and the
cast, which rescued a less-than—perfect
script with a great set and outstanding
chemistry.

Catch the 8:00 p.m. performance in
the Johnson theater at Lenfest on either
Mon. May 23 or Tues. May 24.

A question or

ByHughTrout
THE FISHERMAN

While this might be my last article
and is the end of my freshman year, I refuse
to write that “reﬂecting upon the year”
article because anytime you stop and focus
on the past you distract yourself from the
far more important future.

And I feel like the future holds a lot
of great possibilities: ﬂying cars, no more
Star Wars films, and my own personal
dream of Jéigermeister vending machines
on street corners.

W&L, despite the bitching from
everyone (I am guilty of this about certain
newly enacted policies as well, so I am
not absolving myself from blame) about
how the school is being destroyed, has a
great deal of progress and improvement
ahead.

First off, because of a whole new
and great season of informal rush will be
here next fall, I will have another shot at
finally proposing to the lead singer of
Snackbar Jones and avoiding her
boyfriend, who is also in the band.

I feel like I have a lot to offer:
young, good looking, and can make an
amazing Easy Mac whenever she asks for
it. Keep your fingers crossed for me.

I also hope that maybe Fancy dress
next year can have a better theme. In fact,
if we are being truly candid, I think we
should get rid of the actual event. This
may seem like a horrible idea, but hear me
out.

Everyone ends up having way more
fun at the pre-parties and post-parties, and
the event itself is more a chore or
obligation to go to legitirriize the whole
formal attire and “fancy dress.”

However, what if we all just
pretended that fancy dress was happening
but really never bothered to spend the
money and throw the event?

In other words, it could just be one
of those things W&L people talk about but

 two for you

don’t really do, like the speaking tradition.
That way people wouldn’t feel guilty when
they get blackout and don’t ever go. And
the kind of stuff we could do with that
money could be pretty cool (“Lexington,
Virginia: Home of W&L and the largest
slip-n—slide in the world.” Ever wanted to
go hear a speaker at Lee Chapel but just
didn’t have the energy to walk? Take the
slip—n-slide).

But beyond Fancy Dress’s future, we
should call into question the future of other
school traditions and institutions. What
new buildings will be added to our lovely
campus (may? I suggest a library that
doesn’t make me feel as if I have been sent
to prison every time I actually build up the
dedication to read a book)?

What message will be delivered to
next year’s entering class as to what the
true meaning of being a W&L student is?
What will become of Jeb Brooks?

All these questions loom in the back
of the minds of every W&L student and
offer great hope for making our amazingly
sweet and radical school even doper.

And most of all, let us all hope that
just as the future may allow the United
States to repair it’s image to the rest of the
world and restore good relations, so too
can W&L students convince townies not
to hate us as much as they do, or at least
not to try and gun me down in their cars.

Actually, that only happened once,
but it was one of those small cars that
wouldn’t have killed me but just badly,
badly wounded me which scares me even
more.

I might have broken a lot of bones,
but I would have dominated that Dodge
Neon if I didn’t have the cat-like reﬂexes
that I do. Also, let us all pray for the future
of the NHL because even though my home
town just got its own baseball team, I need
my fast and exciting hockey back.

Well folks, that is about it for me.
Thanks to everyone who helped make my
year a good one and have a great summer
and live the dream.

Ever wanted to go hear a speaker at Lee
Chapel but just didn’t have the energy

to walk? Take the slip-

n—slide.

An extra Early on campus

By Kristine Early
THE MILK AND CHEESE GIRL

Most of you know that I’m not
the first Early to attend Washington
and Lee. What you may not know is
that I’m not the first Early to write for
the back page of the Ring Tum Phi
either. There’s a reason they call me
Early 2.0. See, my brother and I are
pretty much carbon copies of each
other. We’re both ridiculously good
looking, smart, and witty (though I
think I have an edge in all three
categories). In celebration of alumni
weekend, I have invited my brother to
help me coauthor my last article of the
year in Flav/Dub sty1e— only lproniise
that it will make sense.

So, Bryan, what’s it like to be
back in LexVegas? I know you took
your brothers down at the poker table
last Tuesday night. Sure, eight dollars
of your winnings came from my
pocket, but at least we kept it in the

family, eh?

Well, spending a week back
visiting W&L during Spring Term with
literally nothing to do has been very
reminiscent of what my previous
Spring Terms had been like... only
people are a lot nicer to you if they
haven ’t seen you for a year.

The disturbing twist has been

that for all the times you had visited

me at W&L during my four years, now
I’m the one who is introduced to
people as “Kristine Early’s brother. ”
I’m not sure if it’s so much the
continuance of a legacy or
replacement of one for the other.
Well, Bryan, what can I say?
“I’m kind of a big deal. People know
me.” I mean, besides my column I
have the best radio show on WLUR.
Too bad only three people listen. Bry,

tell me, what’s the best thing about W &
L? The beiruit toumeys? Oh, yeah. That’s
right. I forgot. You lost to me last
Wednesdaynight. Taken down by the lil’
sis. Shameful...

If there is anything worse than
losing to your little sister at beruit, it must
be having to worry about your little sister
going out, partying, and dating at W&L.
I ’ve already gotten a few grey hairs—and
I’m working on an ulcer. Fratty
experiences were a lot more enjoyable
when I was the living through/witnessing
them then hearing them second-hand from
or about my sister...

Seriously, getting the call that your
sister just broke your old fraternity ’s house
record for the number of gold fish
consumed in one evening (51!) is a
veritable grab-bag of emotions.‘
bemusement, bewilderment, pride, fear,
disbelief, anger, _ jealousy,
embarrassment... About all you can do is
shake your head.

Dating? Does that take place at
W&L? Casual hook—ups are deﬁnitely the
way to go, Bry. Getting to know someone
is way too much to ask. You should know
that. You may not have been the Ultimate
Frat Lord, but I hear you had game back

in the day. Now that you’re an old geezer '

what do you thing of the frat/srat scene?

Coming back and experiencing the
“good ole days” made me realize that: 1)
Your glory days can be imitated but never
relived 2 ) It’s probably a lot better that
way 3) It deﬁnitely would be a lot healthier
not even to try.

As for your other soul-cringing
comments, I ’m sure that there are plenty

of good-looking, intelligent, well-
intentioned guys left at W&L—-even after
Tim Smith decided to move on—that would
be more than willing to escort you to box
socials, poetry readings, and even the
occasional demolition derby. Barring
that, I ’m glad that you will be working
with nuns this summer... perhaps a bit of
their austerity will rub oﬂ on you.
Man, I really am going to miss

«sketchy dj parties this summer. Maybe I

can get the nuns to live it large, take off
their habits, and get down to “Like a
Prayer.” That would definitely be a party
worth hiring Party Pics for. Anyway, I
think we’re running out of space, big bro.
Before you do the honor of closing my
last article of the ‘O4-‘O5 school year, I
just want to give a shout out to all the
seniors. Good luck, boys and girls. Don’t
trip on the platform June 2"“. That would

M be embarrassing... and very Early-like,

don’t you think, Bry?

After a year gone-by, I can tell that
everybody that although post-college life
is not nearly as fun or exciting, it has its
own set of perks. .. I just can ’t think of any
at the moment. As most of you already
know, nobody who hasn’t been a part of
W&L will ever understand your
experience here. Take what was special,
leave your regrets with the wadded-up
bundle of clothing you leﬁ‘ at thejsteps of
Newcomb when you streaked the
Colonnade and let your fond memories
guide you back whenever you need a
refresher

Well said, Bryan. You didn’t think
I’d actually let you have the last word
though, did you? Of course not.

See, my brother and I are pretty much carbon
copies of each other. We’re both ridiculously F
good looking, smart, and witty.

 

Going home to do list

Breka reminds you what to do before you head home

By Bree Melton and Eka Akpakip
BREKA

It’s the end of spring term,
just one more week...so how are you
going to spend your last couple of days
on this campus before going off to your
summer jobs? It had better be pretty
dominant because you know Breka’s
going to be living it up. We have high
expectations for this campus. So here
are our top ten things to do before the
term is over.

10. Of course, there’s the
quintessential “streak the Colonnade.”
If you haven’t done that, well you just
haven’t lived. If you need to change it
up a bit, you can always streak the
Ruins. But make sure the ground isn’t
wet and security doesn’t catch you.
Hiding naked in the bushes...well
really would security actually chase a
naked person? I mean, catching a
naked person would require
tackling...that’s just not a pleasant
image. So go for it, in the dead of night
or while the sun is still high, you only
have a week left. What do you have to
lose?

9. I don’t know if you got this
from our previous article, but KISS A
SENIOR. Kiss two, or five. . .two each
day...they’ll be gone in a week. So if
you’ve got that senior crush, now is the
time to go for it. And really, they’re
not going to complain! If you’re shy,
you could just go for that sly smack on
the toosh. Not as daring, but very
enjoyable. And no, Joe Harouni, this
is not just for you. But ladies, he’s
always up for anything and plus — it’s
easy to walk back home from Gaines.

8. Skip class. If you haven’t
done it at all this year. . .well you have
a problem. It’s called being a nerd.
Redeem yourself. The sun is shining,
the birds are singing, and most of you
are pretty pasty (special note from Eka,
not all of us can have naturally dark
skin) — so go get some sun!

7. Speaking of sun, where’s the

perfect place to get some of those
wonderful UV rays? Goshen, duh. If you
haven’t yet been to this W&L pastime, you
need to get yourself out there! Or to
Panther Falls — House Mountain, even.
Now is the time to enjoy the weather while
celebrating nature and beer - the best
combination ever. You might even want
to take along that special—just-for-this-
week someone. They could use some sun,
too.

6. Haven’t found that special-just-
for-this-week someone? Well, you could
try a new frat. By this time in the year,
you’ve established the places at which you
like to hang out. You know the guys there
really well, and most of them you probably

wouldn’t hook up with. I mean, they’re '

practically your brothers. So now’s the
time to branch out and check out a new
frat. Or if the Greek scene isn’t your style,
check out “THE SWEET.” They’re
certiﬁed gangsta.

5. Wild card. This is your chance to
be creative because, while you should take
most of your cues from Breka, we want
y’all to be individual and think for
yourselves. It must be something crazy,
maybe slightly dangerous, possibly even
something that would make us raise our
eyebrows - and that’s pretty intense". For
instance, one of our friends went skydiving
this weekend. While this is a little cliché,
it’s still an adrenaline rush, and that counts.
So be spontaneous and have some fun!

4. Another way to have some fun
and achieve carnpus-wide renown is to join
the Colonnade Club. You know what we
mean...hook up in every building on the
Colonnade. This is a bit more of a
challenge than just streaking the
Colonnade because it takes time and
plarming - and a partner. Teamwork is key
in achieving this goal. You may even want
to have two partners so they can switch
off, and no one will get tired. I mean, you
might, but it will be well worth it. If the
Colonnade isn’t your style, you could go
for the Lenfest challenge. The most
impossible challenge ever, but the theatre
majors aren’t daunted. Of course, there is

the Five-Star General. Less commonly
known and soon to disappear as the new
sorority makes its way onto campus. Any
man that can join this elite group should
be commended. If you want detail plans
on how to accomplish this...ask Breka.
While we’ve yet to accomplish it,
(hinthint) we’ve thought it through.

3. We now command you to drink.
Everyday, everywhere. I mean don’t feel
pressured, it’s only a suggestion. And
really, we’re not talking about
alcohol. . .are we? Well maybe just a little.
If there isn’t a lawn party, make your own.
Case of beer plus grass equals lawn party. .
It’s just that simple.

2. In this final week, one of the most
important things to do is tie up loose ends.
You don’t want to leave for the summer
with clothes that aren’t yours and cell
phone numbers you never use. So make
room for summer clothes and numbers.
You know I will. For example: that boy
who you got with in the fall, but you never
called? BALETED. (note: Strongbad
reference). There are non—awkward and
awkward ways to return clothing. One
thing that is not suggested is to go into
someone’s room, ﬁnd them absent, then
think it would be wise to lock the door,
put porn on their computer, and attempt
to run away. -This is not productive, but is

‘ entertaining. So. . . .what is the number one

thing to do before this term ends?

1. BREKA. Heck yes, alot. Ifyou
don’t know us, meet us. If you do know
us, kiss us. You’ve wanted to all year, we
know. Now is your chance. Special deal,
one time only, and Eka won’t slap you.
And if you’re lucky, there might be a Breka
sandwich involved. And when we say
Breka sandwich, we’re talking about
hugging, of course.

If you are daunted by these tasks,
don’t worry, we too are yet to accomplish
all of these things. What is most important
is that you try. But if someone does
accomplish all of our top ten, we will be
happy to share a cold one with you. After
all, a one that is not cold is scarcely a one
at

FROM THE EDITOR

Welcome back!

In thisﬁrst Back-to-
School issue, we want you to
start off the school year off
as informed, energized, and
prepared as possible. We sat
down with acting president
Harlan Beckley and heard his
thoughts on all the hot-button
issues on campus so you
know what to expect from
our administration. We also
included our special Guide to
Lexington on pages 4-5,
complete with a map, driving
directions to get you
everywhere you want to go,
and a fun and informative list
of our 25 favorite things to
do around town. Pull it out,
post it on your hall, stick it in
your glove compartment, and
hang on to it because we
really hope this issue will be
a reliable resource for you.

It’s the beginning of a
new year, and the Phi has
some exciting changes and
refreshing innovations in the
works. As Washington and
Lee’s oldest newspaper, we
will strive to be responsible
journalists this year at a
paper that we believe to be
smart, respected, real, and
trusted by the student body.
We plan to better mirror
student interests, since we
have been called “the voice
of the students” since our
first issue in 1897. For this
reason, we want to hear from
you. Please give us feedback
on what stories you’d like to
see from us. We are
expanding the staff and are
always looking for writers
and photographers who want
to contribute. Email us with
ideas, questions, or concerns
at phi@wlu.edu.

Thanks for reading,
Emily Hulen
Editor-in-Chief

STEVEN MARINOS / PHOTO EDITOR

Acting president Harlan Beckley will return to being the director of his brainchild, the Shepherd Poverty Program, when a new president is found.

Bend it like Beckley

Beckley kicks off the year with the students’ support and an ambitious agenda

You know him.You love him. And now that he’s serving as

W&L’s interim president, you want to know where he stands

on those pressing issues you really care about. We sat down

this week with acting president Harlan Beckley to hear what

he thinks about some of the hottest topics on campus.

By Emily Hulen
and Chris Lauderman
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF. CONTRIBUTING EDITOR

What do you want to see done
with the Greek system this
year?

I hope the Greek system will
remain healthy and thrive
throughout the year.

So, no major changes?
I see no major changes.

What was your reaction to the
new Princeton Review report
that did not list W&L as a top-
ranking party school?

We’re all relieved, of course.

_ But the Princeton Review is not
the main source with which we
would look for an affirmation of
the quality of Washington and
Lee. The Princeton Review will
say what they will.

What do you foresee in the
future of our alcohol policy?
Our alcohol policy will stay as it
is, for the time being... We will
have a mandated review of those
initiatives [this year], of which
the students and faculty and staff
will participate...

How many students will be on
that?

A number of students and a
number of faculty members and
a number of staff. There are
seven different subcommittees,
as I recall... This has been
worked out prior to my coming
to this office, by Provost
Williams and Dean Watkins and
the student leadership.

Sexual assault was such a hot
topic last year — how will you
address it this year?

.

We’ll indeed continue to provide
the kind of education needed in
order to prevent sexual assault.
We don’t have any intentions of
changing those policies.

Can we expect to see your
mark on the strategic report?
You can expect to see forward
progress on the strategic
planning issue, forward progress
that is a collective endeavor of
students, faculty, alumni,
administration and staff.

Has a master planner been
hired?

There is consideration for
bringing in a master planner, and

. the details of that, we’re

working with that project right
now with Vice President Grasso.

What do you want to
accomplish on campus this
year?

What I intend to do is to... we
intend not to tread water at
Washington and Lee this year
but maintain the momentum that
has been established already, so
that when the new president
arrives, she or he will inherit an
institution that has direction but
also allows that person latitude
to develop the issues that she or
he deems important in going
forward. Our goal this year is to
maintain momentum for an
already thriving institution.

How do you feel about the
Shepherd Program’s
development in recent years?
Ah, thrilled by the Shepherd
Program’s development in
recent years! I’m very happy that
Stacy McLoughlin Taylor will be
the acting director this year...

I’m thrilled about the progress...
before I accepted this position, I
had to make sure that the
Shepherd Program would be in
good hands. And I’m looking
forward to the events afterward,
when I return to being the
director of the program.

Philip Norwood has noted your
“ability to bring people
together, to meet and
surmount challenges in a
spirit of collegiality and
cooperation, and to direct
their efforts toward achieving
a common set of goals.” What
do you feel best qualifies you
for the position of interim
president and how do you plan
on using that to better the
school? .

Well, my hope that I fit those
fairly high expectations of
Rector Norwood’s but I do know
this faculty and I do think I
know the students from teaching
here and having spent 31 years
here. I also know a number of ’
alumni and I will work hard to
enlist to peop1e—staff faculty,
and students to help us move
forward with what we’ve been
doing this year.

As you say, you’ve spent 31
years here—how has W&L
shaped you as a person?
That’s a very interesting
question. W&L has given me
and I think a lot of the faculty
and students here the
opportunity to take initiatives on
our own and develop our
potential, and I am grateful for
what W&L has done in that
regard. So it’s offered me an
opportunity to develop as a
scholar and a as teacher and to
take on the challenges of the
Shepherd Program for 8 years.

What qualities do you think we
should be looking for in the
next president?

Someone who will affirm the
important core values of this
institution — the close

Beckley says
to be on the iookout for...

" thepmandated review of our
4~year-old alcohol policy

° progress of the Shepherd
Program on a national level

' forward progress on the
vsuategic plan

' a new president probably
between March andisept.

relationship between faculty and
students, the Honor System — I
think there’s a growing interest
among the student body in
service and civic engagement
and who will take new initiatives
affirm and develop our capacity
to provide new initiatives that
can help students develop...

Any guess on how long it may
take to find someone?

Well we can’t expect to find
someone probably before March
or April at the earliest, but we
can’t be sure—it’s an open-
ended process. We’re going to
wait to get the best possible
candidate. I don’t expect to
return to the classroom until a
year from September. We hope
to have a president in place
sometime soon.

I know it’s early on in the
process, but do you know of
any interested candidates at
this point?

Well, Emily, I don’t know who
the candidates are, but I do
know... Brian Murchison from
the law school is the chair of the
search committee and he will be
receiving nominations. Students
are welcome to nominate a
candidate, and students will be
involved in the search
committee. Students are
welcome to advise the
committee of the criteria they
think are important for W&L.

Students ask for
specific qualities
in next president

By Erin Julius
CONTRIBUTING EDITOR

Next weekibegins the search
for a new W&L president.

Board of Trustees Rector
Philip Norwood will announce
the members of the Search and
Screening Committee this week,
said Professor Brian Murchison,
chair of the committee.

A website has been set up so
that interested students can share
their thoughts about the search
process. Students can ﬁnd fur-
ther information and updates at
presidentialsearch.wlu.edu and
can email their input to
presidentialsearch@wlu.edu.

Murchison said an open fo-
rum is planned next week so that
members of the Washington and
Lee community, including stu-
dents, can meet with an outside
consultant, Dr. Barbara Taylor of
Academic Search Consultation
Service.

Student leaders already know
what they want to see in Presi-
dent Tom Burish’s successor.

“It should be someone who is
students-first,” said Drew Dav-
enport, ’06, a dorm counselor. “It
needs to be someone who is out
on campus,’ at football games
and in the Commons - someone
who isn’t just a suit.-”

Davenport said that last year,
Burish took Davenport’s hall of
freshman out for pizza. Sharing
dinner with the president of the
University made an impact on
the freshman, Davenport said.
“That wouldn’t happen at state
schools.”

Sonia Siu, ’07, works to help
raise money for the Annual Fund
and said she hopes the next
President already has strong ties
to the alumni.

“Contact and relationships
with student leaders is also im-
portant,” Siu said.

-- Recommended by Sara Duckworth,

Tired of the hustle and bustle
of the Fitness Center? Want to
get some solo exercise time in?
Gaines Hall’s basement features a
smaller, but stillfully-loaded gym
that is rarely used. Perfect for when
all the machines in Warner Center are
taken, and perfect for when you want
to blast your own music.

Haven on the hill. Solace can be
sought in the ravine between Woods
Creek Apartments and the main
campus at the library and Commons.
This natural haven boasts a stream,
woodlands, and is well-lit at night, as
well as being accessible from
anywhere on campus. Perfect for
meditation, martial arts, play
rehearsals, or just about anything
else.

Wake up and smell the coffee.
Show up at the Lex Coffee Shop
around 7:30 a.m. on any Wednesday
morning to enjoy live, impromptu
folk music with all theilocal talent
(including our very own Burr Datz).

Get ready for a scare. Leam
local Lex history by taking the ghost
tour. A must for freshmen not
familiar with Lexington.

A cut above. Salon 215, located at
215 S. Main St., is great for any hair
needs. The atmosphere is the best in
Lexington. Kudos for making males
feel welcome by having guy
magazines like Esquire in the waiting
area.

Have an art attack. All the art
galleries in Lex open up for wine and
cheese tastings on the first Friday of
every month, starting at 5:30 p.m. So
get in touch with your artsy side as
you snack, sip, and stroll the streets.

Hit the highways. Take a drive on
one of the many scenic highways
that run through Lexington. and blow
off some steam while taking in some ,
of the gorgeous views of the Blue
Ridge Mountains.

Get your sushi ﬁx. Stop by the
International Food Store, grab some
great sushi you can’t ﬁnd anywhere
else in Lex, and imagine you’re in
civilization instead of the middle of
nowhere for a bit.

The reel deal. Take a trip back in
time and enjoy a good movie with
good friends under the stars at Hull’s
Drive-in.

Fall in love with Lenfest. Give
in to your taste for the arts

and check out one of the many great
plays, operas, and concerts
sponsored by the school.

Lee Chapel without the blazer.
Although we all walk past it
everyday, few of us have ever
stopped and toured our own national
landmark, Lee Chapel. Take a peek in
and learn about some of the history
of our college and its founders.
Below the chapel is a small but
informative museum that houses
some historic treasures. Best of all,
Lee Chapel attire is not required!

Tales of the crypt. Many people
visit the Lexington graveyard to see
Stonewall Jackson’s tomb, but the

enticements of the graveyard reach

far beyond history. For the
excessively romantic among us,
bring along a book of poetry and
read it aloud under a willow. Or go
just before dusk to experience the
creepiness. A quick walk through the
graveyard puts your life and its
problems into perspective as you
realize that this too shall pass.

Cheap pleasures. Daily Grind
house blend with Splenda warms
you up. Pink Hut’s swirl with
sprinkles cools you down (best $1.30
out there).

Music of the night. The Theater
at Lime Kiln has great outdoor music
on Sunday nights, and the local
volunteers are a wealth of
information.

Who needs McDonald’s? Kenny
Burger is hands down the best place
to get a milkshake, fries, and a
burger. This ain’t bodily health, but
it sure helps the mental state of mind.

Cat’n Books. The cat, Annie, at
Books & Co. on Nelson Street cracks
me up. It’s a cute little bookstore,
but that cat puts it over the top.

Tangable support. Tracey at
Intimate U can ﬁx you up for any of
you Washington and Lee events.
Victoria’s Secret has nothing on
Tracey’s skill.

Bah, ruining my skin. Laying
out by the Ruins with shorts, in my
case 45spf, and a text book is almost
the perfect way to spend an
afternoon. It could be considered
studying?!

Goshen Lizarding. Laying out on
the rocks at Goshen and napping is
purely blissful. Wonderful drive and
plenty of‘natural beauty.

Raining cats and dogs. Didn’t
do so hot on a test or having
‘relationship issues’? Well go wash
a puppy at the SPCA and you’ll feel
a hell of a lot better. You’ll be
completely drenched and smell
horrible, but it’s a small price to pay.

Best views around. Drive to
Buena Vista and you’ll never again
complain that there is nothing to do
in Lexington. Comparisons can. work
wonders. Eat at Nick’s for Italian or
Canton for Chinese, then plan for a
night at SVU’s theatre to see talent
on a low budget.

Bagel Wednesday. Healthy
Foods gets Fresh bagels in on
Tuesdays, so you don’t have to deal
with Lendens for awhile.

Eat your greens. Not the biggest
meat fan? Healthy foods has the
best lunches (they’re big enough to
also be dinner) and they are all
homemade and right there next to
campus. The women who work there
do amazing things with beans and
rice!

A torrid love affair. The chocolate
cake at Joyful Spirit and the Volcano
at Cafe Michel. Enough said.

Late night pillaging. Wade
through the $5.50 DVD bin at Wal-
Mart to find some hidden gems at
great prices.

Anderson, Chris Lauderman, and Emily Hulen.

W&L opens doors
to hurricane victims

By Leah Kershaw
and Katelyn Finley

NEWS EDITOR, STAFF WRITER

In the wake of Katrina,
New Orleans students have
scattered in search of a fu-
ture.

When the hurricane hit
New Orleans, sophomore
Kate Chiasson and her
roornates were getting ready
to start the upcoming school
year at Tulane .

“I moved in my furniture
and clothes on a Friday and
left Saturday morning,” said

I Chiasson.

Now, just a few weeks
later, Chiasson and her room-
mates are attending different
schools across the nation.

As for their house, “It’s
under two feet of water and
I’m worried about looting
and mold,” said Chiasson.

Junior Skye Eiswirth,
who learned about W&L’s .
program to offer admission to
Tulane students from a fam-
ily friend, had similar prob-
lems ﬁnding a school.

“A lot of universities are
only taking people from their
states. That was really aggra-

, vating and made it hard to
find a good school,” said
Eiswirth. .

Chiasson, who said she is
glad to be at W&L, was of-
fered admission for fall se-
mester a few days after
faxing in her one~page appli-
cation. I

Participating in the Zeta
Tau chapter of Kappa Kappa
Gamma has helped Chiasson
with the transition, as well as
some of her close friends who
already attend W&L, she
said.

However, Chiasson said
she is excited to go back to
New Orleans even though
“the city isn’t going to be the
same. Jazz Fest and Mardi
Gras won’t happen,” said
Chiasson, “There is a possi-
bility but who knows?”

Eiswirth is optimistic
about both the upcoming

, spring semester at Tulane and
the rebuilding of New Or-
leans.

“A lot of people are go-
ing to have school spirit,”

‘ said Eiswirth, “I think New
Orleans is going to be ‘a lot
better and a lot safer.”

TOP GIRLS

Wiant among first W&L Women

Sally Wiant opens up about her experiences as
one of the very first women to graduate from W&L

By Steph Wiechmann
STAFF WRITER

In 1972, Sally Wiant entered a
foreign world. Not knowing
anyone “east of the Mississippi
River,” she came to Lexington,
Virginia — to a world of men.

Wiant entered the Washington
and Lee School of Law as one of
the six women students admitted
in the fall of 1972 to become the
first women to graduate from the
institution. She, herself, took a
different approach to the typical
three-year course of study.

Then-Dean Roy Steinheimer
brought Wiant here as a junior
professional librarian. They
worked out an agreement that she
would work half the time and
attend classes half the time.

Wiant spent six years in law
school and graduated in 1978.
She has been on the law faculty
ever since.

Being one of the first women
to attend Washington and Lee,
Wiant and her fellow female
students had quite an arrival here
on campus.

Unlike the preparation done
before the implementation of co-
education here in 1985, the law
school was not ready for the new
women students.

“There was no thought given
to where we would live or health
services,” said Wiant. “In fact,

there was so little thought given
to our arrival, that one of the first
things the SBA president.did was
to write a lengthy memo to the
dean of the law school requesting
that he change the faculty men’s
restroom to a ladies’ room.”

The male law students, though,
were quite welcoming.

In the 1970s, a typical law
class would contain about 75
students. Wiant said that it was
“like having that many older
brothers watching out for every
little thing you did.”

Difficulties didn’t show up
until the third class of female
students arrived.

“By then, the newness had
worn off,” Wiant said.

The undergraduate male
students took a different
approach. Tucker Hall was home
to the law school until 1973, so
law students and undergrads saw
each other regularly.

These students were not too
happy about the law class’s
change in composition. But, like
southern gentlemen, they put a
positive spin on the event.

“They felt,” said Wiant, “that
it was the law school and not the
undergraduate student population
that was being invaded.”

The Alumni Office also
presented complications. She
said, “Every time the Alumni
Office would send me

 

“It may be time for us

to seriously consider a
female candidate for the
[university] presidency.

That would be bold, indeed.”

SALLY WIANT, W&L LAW CLASS OF ‘78

information, it was always
addressed to Mr. Sarah Wiant.”
Still, Wiant persevered and has
enjoyed her time here, seeing the
changes that the campus has gone
through. She was present during
the co-education period, when the
undergraduate women did not
have such an easy time as she
herself did only years before.
“We didn’t suffer the barrage
of negative comments as the
undergraduate campus did,” she
said. “[Ours] was much more
subtle.” She did welcome the
changes and likes what has seen
so far.
“The stellar increase in
academics has been remarkable.”
During this year-long
celebration of women at W&L,
Wiant looks back on her time here
and reﬂects how the campus has
changed — and informs us that we
still have a long way to go.
“This is still a very male
campus,” she warns us. “It’s
remarkable that we’ve never had
a permanent female Dean of the

College. It’s remarkable to me
that only this year has the law
school ever had a woman in a
faculty-chaired position. It’s
remarkable to me that we’ve never
had a woman Dean of the law
school or a woman Dean of the
commerce school....

“It seems to me that there are
some very strong women
candidates out there and it may be
the time for the University to
recognize that.

“And,” she adds, “it may be
time for us to seriously consider a
female candidate for the
[university] presidency. That
would be bold, indeed. There
might be the right candidate out
there.”

Wiant was a pioneer when it
came to both female education and
faculty here at our alma mater.
She fought for what she thought
she deserved, and for it received
a place in our history book.

Against all odds, Wiant turned
what was once a man’s world into
her own.

Men’s Soccer shows promise

Team kicks into action with the hopes of coming away withthe QDAC title

By Jacob Geiger
STAFF WRITER

Just three weeks into the 2005
campaign, the men’s soccer team
is makinga habit of taking games
down to the wire.

The first three games were all
decided by one goal, and two went
into double overtime.

Though forward Jack Palmer’s
dramatic golden goal to beat
Catholic 3-2 was offset by a heart-
breaking last second loss to South-
ern Virginia, there’s no doubt that
the Generals are poised for a suc-
cessful season.

Freshman midﬁelder Fletcher
McCraw said the captains “estab-
lish an environment that helps the
team come together.”

The captains emphasized the
team’s goal of winning the
ODAC championship.

' “That’s a pretty unanimous
goal, ” Wallace reported.

“What’s the point of just say-
ing, ‘I hope we win some games

“I don ’t think anyone, especially the seniors,

with the ODAC title.”

will be truly satisﬁed unless we come away

- MATT WALLACE, CLASS OF 2006
 

this year’? I don’t think anyone,
especially the seniors, will be truly
satisfied unless we come away
with the ODAC title.”

While stressing that every con-
ference game is important, senior
Robert Morscheiser acknowl-
edged that “the biggest stretch for
us will be our ﬁnal three games
against Roanoke, Wesleyan and
Lynchburg, who were seeded one,
two, and three respectively in the
preseason polls.”

He also emphasized the team’s
need to “play up to [its] potential
this year. There’s a lot of talent
on this team and there’s no rea-
son we shouldn’t put together a
solid season.”

While Wallace cautioned against
looking ahead on the schedule, he
did admit that, “as usual, the
Roanoke game will deﬁnitely be one
to watch.”

One crucial element of the team’s
success so far has been the hot foot
of sophomore Josh Dodds, who
notched four goals in the ﬁrst three
games. Morscheiser called Dodds
the team’s most improved player
and said he’s been playing “on a first
class level.”

Dodds, who’s making a huge
impact in only his second season,
also leads a group of talented sopho-
mores and freshmen who will lead
the team in future seasons.

McCraw has seen some minutes

at midﬁelder, while Wade Cruser
of Norfolk has occasionally
paired with Dodds at the front of
the W&L attack.

Wallace also mentioned
Tommy Pignatelli, a scrappy 5’4”
forward from Chatham, New Jer-
sey. “He’s quick,” Wallace an-
nounced, “but he needs to grow
about 6 inches and put on 30-40
pounds. Chris Schall will whip
him into shape eventually.”

The captains also talked about
Head Coach Rolf Piranian, a 1974
W&L grad who is in his 30th sea-
son as head coach.

“I don’t think you can argue
with experience,” -Wallace said.
“He’s really old school butkeeps
up with the changing trends in
soccer and new ideas. He loves
good, hard, honest play. Really
blue-collar.”

With Piranian and his son,
Mike, coaching from the bench
and with three great captains on
the ﬁeld, the Generals seem cer-
tain to make some noise in the
ODAC beforethe end of the sea-
son.

Greek Summit: ‘Great’ or just a snoozefest‘?

Attendance was low but intentions were good at this weekend’s forum for Greek improvement

By Sarah Murray
and Rob Armstrong
STAFF WRITERS

Administrators, alurrmi, and
current students met this week-
end to decide the future of the
Greek system.

The Greek summit offered
various speakers a chance to
spotlight both pros and cons of
the current fraternities and so-
rorities.

“We need to take an honest i

look at ourselves and evaluate
our performance,” Jon
Williamson, executive vice
president of the North Ameri-
can Fraternity Conference, said
at Friday’s opening session.
One session, titled “Moving
From Good to Great,” voiced a

theme repeated frequently
throughout the weekend.
Adelaide Ng ‘08, said,
“They’re sending out a good
message for being able to stand
up for what you believe in.”
The highlight of the first night
was a slideshow giving examples
of courage throughout history.
The screen read, “What will it
take for fraternities and sorori-
ties to endure? Courage.”
Familiar imagesof Iraqi citi-
zens in voting booths, Martin
Luther King, Jr., Rosa Parks,
President Reagan and Sept. 11
rescue workers were shown.
The theme seemed a bit odd
to Ng, who said some people
may have had problems connect-
ing civil rights heroes with fra-
ternity brothers. Regardless, she

said, “All the people made it a
positive experience:

Saturday’s keynote speaker
David Stollman emphasized the
importance of countering nega-
tive Greek stereotypes as well as
fostering improvement in the
student members of each orga-
nization.

“[Stollman’s] speech really
got the audience’s attention...it
was quite captivating,” said Neal
Schaeffer ‘O8. ,

Saturday’s activities also in-
cluded small discussion groups
on topics such as current prob-
lems with the Greek system, val-
ues of Greek organizations, and
changes that can be made. Se-
nior Elizabeth Eisenbrandt said,
“We have been working within
our Greek organizations for the

past three years and our opinions
and experiences helped inform
the upcoming leaders.”

Eisenbrandt, a co—chair of the
summit, said the discussions of-
fered an opportunity for upper-
classmen to shape the way their
organizations will run after their
graduation.

Not all students were as
thrilled with proceedings.
Schaeffer said, “each session had
a speciﬁc goal, but in the end got
back to the same stuff,” referring
to the repeated “Good to Great’
theme. He called the weekend
“a bit redundant.”

The low attendance later in
the proceedings suggests that
others agreed. At one point in his
speech Saturday night, Stollman,
attempting to recognize mem-

bers of each organization, called
out to Sigma Chi, whose mem-
bers had made an early exit.

Senior Justin Hannon, Presi-
dent of Sigma Chi, said he did
not deny this claim, but declined
further comment.

. In a brief speech Friday, act-
ing President Harlan Beckley
praised students for their hard
work on the summit, mentioning
that Greeks have a “special obli-
gation” to give back to the school
that has given so much to them.

“We’re headed in the right
direction,” said Ng, “the intent

' behind the summit was good.”

After a rocky start against
non-ODAC teams, the‘
Generals Field Hockey
team is ready to charge

into the season.

By Sarah Bloom
STAFF WR|TER

Imagine a first place ranking
in the ODAC, your best season
ever, personally winning the Con-
ference Championship, our best

SCBSOII CV8!" 3S a team, earning 8 .

bid to the NCAA. I hope you can
because I am.

Coach Orrison’s words in
mind, the women’s ﬁeld hockey
team returned to school in early
August for rigorous preseason
doubles and team selection.

With ten new freshmen, the
team must rely not only on fresh
talent, but on the experience of
good returning athletes like senior
captains Jane Beall and Kate
Lester.

The ofﬁcial start of the season
brought frustrating early losses to
non-ODAC teams, Catholic and
Johns Hopkins, calling for a re-
view of basics.

“We just had to practice ﬁnd-
ing each other on the ﬁeld,” said
sophomore Kendall Korte.

The team’s energy and mo-
mentum to have the best season
ever, however, was not lost with
the loss of a few games.

  
Apply t 

“We have great skills, and it is
just going to take some ironing out
to get everyone gelling and on the
same page,” said Beall of the
losses. '

“Those teams are always really
good,” added Korte of Catholic
and Hopkins. “It’s hard because
we start our season so much later
than they do. They have an advan-
tage because they are already 4
games deep when we play them,
but I think our teams are equal.”

Ranked third in the ODAC pre-
season poll, the Generals will need
to turn this year’s play-record
around in order to claim victory
over first and second ranked
Lynchburg and Virginia Wesleyan.

Coach Orrison has conﬁdence
in her team’s ability to do just
that.

In a preseason interview
Orrison stated, “One of my goals
is to be undefeated at home. If we
do, then we will have a great
chance to host the ODAC Cham-
pionship.”

Four-year player and team cap-
tain Jane Beall will be relied
heavily upon for her talent and
experience on offense as the Gen-

erals take on their ODAC rivals.

In the past, Beall has lead the
team in scoring, goals and assists
and already has a school record to
her name for career assists.

“To host the ODAC champi-
onship on the new W&L turf ﬁeld
would be such an advantage,” said
Korte of the chance to play in front
of a home crowd. Most of the
other teams still practice on grass
fields.

On Wednesday, the team will
ﬁnally have the chance to take on
one of their biggest rivals when
they play Lynchburg College.

“We’re going to need to start
finishing our goals to win the
games,” said Korte. “We’re going
to have to realize that we’re not
going to ﬁnd the perfect shot ev-
ery time and that we need to just
be aggressive and go for them
when we’re close.”

Captain Beall agrees: “I want
people to be concerned when they
play us. We need to be a threat,

Beall, like her coach and team-
mates, would like to see the team
not only imagine, but play a per-
fect year.

“I want people to be concerned when
they play us. We need to be a threat,
and I think we can be.”

Described by the cast as “the granddaddy of
sketch comedy, ” Second City’s quirky cast took
a few minutes before their Wednesday show to

answer some questions about who they are,

what they do and how they operate.

By Kate Shellnutt
STAFF WRITER

Who starts in Chicago,
tours all over the country,
and ends up on the stage of
Saturday Night Live?

No need to look to the
back of the joke book for
the answer to this one. The
Second City performed at
the Lenfest Center this
week, bringing one of the
nation’s most famous com-
edy revues to Lexington.

After learning, teaching,
and writing sketch and
improv comedy from Sec-
ond City’s base in Chicago,
the troupe transformed in to
“a big nerdy band,” said

Hans Holsen, Second City
cast member, to travel
around the country and per-
form.

The ﬂexibility of the en-
semble-based show al-
lowed the cast to tailor
their jokes specifically to
the W&L audience.

“We like to localize it
and bring the show there,”
said another cast member,
Dana Quercioli. Jokes in-
volving Traveller, Lexing-
ton, Greek life, and the
nearby University of Vir-
ginia kept students laugh-
ing.

“For a lot of audiences,
this is the first time they’ve
seen a comedy revue, so

it’s pretty much always a
positive response,” she
said.

The show proves con-
sistently funny, but its
improvisational elements
allow for variety in con-
tent.

“Some audiences are
more politically driven,
some catch subtle things,
and some have dirty
minds...,” said Joe
Grazulis, Second City
musical director. “Well,
they pretty much all have
at least that one guy with
the dirty mind.”

With jokes varying
from political to every-
day, satirical to light-
hearted (see sidebar for
examples), the group tip-
toes “the line” of
present-day comedy.

Some pieces, like a
frustrated high school
math teacher or annoying

toddler at the pool, re-
semble characters on Satur-
day Night Live, where most
Second City performers
dream of ending up, and
where most do.

The program’s alumnae
list boasts John Belushi,
Gilda Radner, Dan Akroyd,
Eugene Levy, Bill Murray,
Martin Short, and even cur-
rent SNL cast members
Horatio Sans and Tina Fey.

Other pieces include
music, audience interac-
tion, or even mime to score
audience laughs.

Some jokes, however,
are neither written nor im-
provised.

“I pretty much mess up
every night,” admitted
Quercioli. “But people
think it’s funny, so it kinda
becomes part of the show.”

Improvising keeps audi-
ences laughing, which is re--
ally the ultimate punch line.

Shelly Gossman, and Ryan Archibald

Do they ever mess up?
“Nightly,” Dana said of
herself. “But, yeah, it’s
part of the show.” The au-
dience can deﬁnitely sec-
ond that sentiment, espe-
cially after listening to her
mispronounce “denomina-
tor” four times.

What kind of response
are they used to?

“For a lot of audiences this
is the first time they’ve
seen a comedy revue, so it’
s always a positive re-
sponse.” Dana said.

How do they travel?
While they are on tour, the
troupe drives rental cars,
and flies to more distant lo-

cations like San Diego or
New Mexico.

Where are they from?
The performers Wednesday
all began as theater per-
formers in Chicago, before
studying at the conserva-
tory there.

What do they do when
they’re not touring?
Although the group per-
forms throughout the year,
they do fewer shows during
the summer. During the
time in between, they re-
turn to Chicago, where they
perform, teach classes, and
rehearse 3 times a week.

Pick the punchline.

The term “situational comedy” reminds audiences that
humor comes from just that, a character’s situation at a
particular moment. The comedy revue The Second City
used sketches and songs to demonstrate this humor.

the context in which they were said?

Homecoing
fashion sense

What to wear and what not to wear this weekend

By Eka Akpakip and Bree Melton
STAFF COLUMNISTS

Okay ladies and gents, it’s that
time of year again, andeven earlier
than usual. That’s right, it’s
Homecoming Weekend.

The weekend during which the
alumni return to revel in their days
of yore, the fraternities host some
of the most important nights of
formal recruitment, and great
bands and parties abound across
campus.

But what, oh what, is one to
wear? Certainly this is old hat to
many, but the poor little freshmen,
like so many lost lambs, haven’t a
clue which little black dress is
appropriate.

Boys, let’s face it: coat and tie.
It’s simple, it’s classic, you’ve got
a million in your closet. That’s
your decision because Breka really
just doesn’t have the time to pick
out everyone’s outﬁt!

But Breka also understands
how those of our gender,
especially the younger ones, fret
themselves silly over minute
details such as what to wear. Now
is the time for us to impart our
wisdom as those women who
came before us. Breka will reveal
the mystery of Homecoming
Garb.

So back to‘ the matter at hand:
what is a girl to wear? This is
where that quintessential little
black dress that you bought
because you couldn’t pass up the
sale, but you didn’t know when
you would ever wear it comes in
to play. Now is the time to break
that dress out. . .and hopefully you

have two of them.

Friday night is the slightly
more formal night with dinners,
cocktail parties and alum-
schmoozing. (Get the practice in
now, it’s what you will be doing
for practically the rest of your
adult life!)

The next day kicks off with the
football game against Centre.
This is when it is appropriate to
don those madras and Nantucket
red pants you’ve been itching to
wear, gentlemen.

Ladies, you know what to do:
sundress, cute heels, pearls.
Please, you’ve got this down.

But what about Saturday
night? This is the night that you
go a little less formal.

If you were wearing tea length
the night before, deﬁnitely wear
the cocktail length tonight. That’s
just above the ankle and just
below the knee, respectively.

Saturday night is full of bands
and" running from one fraternity
house to the next. There will be
dinner, cocktails and schmoozing
still, but there’s definitely more
activity on Saturday than there
will be on Friday.

It may even be appropriate to
return to your room and change for
the bands after dinner and
cocktails, but you won’t see Breka
doing that. Oh no, we have
partying in our formal wear down
to an art.

So be safe, have fun, and if you
don’t have a date, go out anyway.
Nothing makes a girl feel like a
million dollars like putting on a
great dress.

BY THE STUDENTS AND FOR THE STUDENTS SINCE 1897

Business is blooming

Despite concerns, Lexington shop owners prove that they have a green thumb for success

By Jacob Geiger
R E P O R T E R

Despite the closure last spring
of College Town Shops and
Graden’s Shoe Store, proprietors
throughout the downtown area
insist Lexington’s historic down-
town business district is doing just
ﬁne.

Shop owners across the busi-
ness spectrum — from Al Carter at
Alvin-Dennis to Julie Lindsey at
Virginia Born and Bred ~ ﬁrmly
denied any reports that suggest the
downtown area is slumping.

Carter, who opened his upscale
clothing store on the corner of
Washington and Jefferson in 1963
and now runs it with the help of
his daughter, mentioned that
Graden’s didn’t shut down be-
cause of ﬂagging sales.

“I think his wife, a doctor, just
took a job in a different city,”
Carter reported. “Besides, some-
one moved right into the space and
started up another business.”

Julie Lindsey has owned Vir-
ginia Born and Bred since 1993;
the store has operated under that
name since it opened in 1986. She
says the key to her business lies
in catalogue and online sales.

“Those sales help as much as
anything; they’re just as important
to my business as the walk—in sales
are.”

Lindsey also credits the Lex-
ington Downtown Development
Association’s Main Street pro-
gram as well as what she called
“a very active Chamber of Com-
merce” for the area’s success.

Sammy Moore, a Lexington
native who has been the executive
director of the Chamber for twelve
years, concurred with much of
what the shop owners had to say.

“What goes out the back door
of these stores — in catalogue or
intemet sales — is every bit as im-
portant as what goes out the front
door.

During his twelve years at the
Chamber of Commerce Moore has
developed something of a mantra
for the city: “Lexington does what
it does well.’’

He said, “the business commu-
nity realizes that students and tour-
ists are the main customers. Some
shop owners have told me that
their gross sales during W&L Par-

ents’ Weekend can exceed gross
sales for the months of January or
February.”

When asked if the arrival of
Wal-Mart had hurt downtown,
Moore, whose family ran a down-
town food business for over forty

years, said it had just made things
different, not necessarily worse.

“This is a different downtown
then it was 30 years ago; back then
you had small hardware stores,
grocery stores, and even car
dealerships.

ILLUSTRATION: EMILY HULEN

What Wal-Mart has done, he
said, is force shop-owners to be
better at what they do.

“We can’t compete with their
prices, so we have to provide
something on the service end that
you can’t get out there.” Carter,

to?
VOLUME elf, NUMBER 5

owner of Alvin-Dennis, even ar-
gued that the downtown area is ac-
tually stronger than it was back in
1963.

“When I opened my store,” he
said, “Washington Street hardly
had any businesses on it. Now it’s
full of newer shops, and once the
Dutch Inn gets ﬁxed up it’ll spruce
up the street even more.”

Dan Vance of the Edward
Jones Investment Group believes
that marketing is a key to success
downtown.

“Pumpkinseeds probably has
the best marketing in town.
They’ve ﬁgured out how to mar-
ket to out-of-town folks. Some of
the locals think the stuff that gets
sold in there is crazy, but visitors
seem to love it.”

While Vance points to Pump-
kinseeds as a success story, he also
notes that some spaces seem to
always be turning over. Both he
and Lindsey mentioned a bakery
on Washington Street that seems
to change hands on an annual ba-
sis. I

“Things definitely aren’t per-
fect here,” Vance concluded, “but
what in life is perfect?”

The Lexington business com-
munity is also lucky to have a
strong support network.

Lindsey credited the local his-
torical society for “keeping down-
town looking nice. They make
sure nobody tries to do something
silly like paint a building orange.
They’re really in charge of pre-
serving the quaint, historical feel
of the downtown area,”

The Lexington Downtown De-
velopment Association is charged
with supporting and maintaining
the vitality of the area.

Don Hasfurther was the direc-

tor of the group, but last spring he

resigned to take another job. The
LDDA has nobody staffing their
ofﬁce right now, but the associa-
tion is supposed to be interview-
ing candidates for the director’s
position.

Lydia Pannell, owner of Fun
Foods & Accessories and some-
one who has been mentioned as a
possible candidate for the LDDA’s
top position, provided information
about the group’s Main Street pro-
gram.

Sterner gives different inﬂuence

Speaker driven to warn of the effects of driving under the influence after spring break disaster

By Sarah Kientz
RE PORTER

The lights in the Lenfest Audi-
torium dim and a ﬁgure takes the
stage.

He’s young and wearing laid-
back clothing, not dissimilar from
the outﬁts of the audience mem-
bers.

Instead of delving into a long-
winded speech, one that many au-
dience members may have ex-
pected, he begins by asking a few
simple questions.

“How many people in the room
have ever done something stupid
when they were drunk?”

Nearly every hand rises. As the
questions continue, fewer and
fewer people raise their hands.

“How many have woken up
and thought, “where am I?”

“How many have gone on
Spring Break with their friends?

“How many have driven with
a drunk driver? How many have
gone on Spring Break, drove
drunk, and killed three of their
best friends?”

At this ﬁnal question, only the
speaker, Mark Sterner, raises his
hand.

Sterner’s presentation, titled
“DUI: A Powerful Lesson”, was
intended to raise awareness and
warn students of the consequences
of drinking and driving.

The speech proved effective in
reaching the W&L audience as
students could relate to Sterner as
an individual.

Karlyn Gold, president of the
Panhellenic Council, worked to
bring Sterner to W&L.

Gold heard Mark Sterner’s

story at a national Greek confer- ‘

ence in Chicago last February, and
said, “his presentation was so bru-
tally real and evocative that we de-
cided students needed to hear it.

“Rather than just telling you to
not drink and drive, Stemer’s pre-
sentation illustrates the actual pain
and suffering that resulted from
his choosing to di*ive after drink-
ing,” Gold said.

The presentation opened with
a home video Sterner made dur-
ing a Spring Break trip he and four

“...his presentation was so brutally real

and evocative that we decided students

needed to hear it.”

- Senior KARLYN GOLD, President of the Panhellenic Council
 

of his fraternity brothers took to
Sanibel, Florida, their senior year.

Sterner told the audience he
made the video so he and his
friends could look back and laugh.

“I’ll never sit down and watch
this tape with my friends and
laugh,” Sterner said, “because 15
minutes after we made this my
three best friends died.”

Jan Kaufman, Director of
Health Promotion, said that

_ Stemer’s presentation was an im-

portant one for W&L students to
hear.

Despite Traveller’s safety and
popularity on campus, Kaufman
said drinking and driving is still
an issue.

“I’ve looked at core data from
last year and we know that 25%
of our students have driven under

the influence,” Kaufman said.
“We feel that we’d like to do bet-
ter than that.”

Kaufman said Traveller gives
students no excuse to drink and
drive.

“Traveller being on campus
and one of the strongest safe ride
programs in the country, there’s no
reason why students should be
driving under the influence,”
Kaufman said.

“We want students to know the
impact of driving under the inﬂu-
ence and its consequences.”

Katelyn Giarratana, Travel1er’s
Committee Chair, agreed that al-
though students do take advantage
of Traveller, there is still an incli-
nation for older students to drink
and drive.

“A majority of upperclassmen

live off campus and are spread out
within a few miles,” Giarratana
said.

“There’s always the temptation
to drink and drive. Traveller gives
students no excuse to, but it’s an
issue on every college campus.”

As well as being an problem
on campus, drinking is a large is-
sue when students go on vacation
as well.

Like many college students,
Sterner and his friends were de-
termined to have an unforgettable
Spring Break.

“We were going to get out of
hand,” Sterner said. “We were
going to show Sanibel anight that
wouldn’t be soon forgotten. We
didn’t realize how true that turned
out to be.”

Students will be able to appre-
ciate Sterner’s message,
Giarratana said, because of his
similarity W&L students.

“I hope students take away
how relevant [the problem] is to
our community,” Giarratana said.

Staying up .
for St. Jude’s;

Students show they care by raising funds for childhood cancer

By Abri Nelson
REPORTER

At St. Jude Children’s Re-
search Hospital in Memphis, TN
it is not uncommon to see children
playing on one of the indoor play-
grounds or laughing as they run
through the painted hallways of
the facility. Only these children
are different from most of their
peers — they all have some form
of cancer.

St. Jude, founded by late actor
Danny Thomas, opened its doors
in 1962 to any child suffering from
childhood cancer, at no cost to
their family whatsoever.

In fact, St. Jude feels more like
a hotel than a hospital, according
to sophomore Erin Vaughn, who
visited the facility over the sum-
mer along with junior Amanda
Dysart and senior Christine Gray.

In addition to the patients that
come to the hospital every day,
about 60 patients live at the hos-
pital with their families. Vaughn
said that most of the children do
not even realize that they have a
disease. They are too busy play-
ing and having fun to care about
chemotherapy or their regular vis-
its to the doctors at the facility.

The hospital is also a research
center, dedicated to ﬁnding cures
for various types of cancer and
sharing their research with doctors

around the world. The hospital
costs approximately $1 million a
day to run the various programs,
and that money comes solely from
donations. _

Up ‘Til Dawn is a series of
fundraisers centered on a letter
writing campaign to raise money
to support the medical care and
research at St. Jude. Dysart, the
president of W&L’s chapter of Up
‘Til Dawn, first heard about the
program from a friend at Vifrlliam
and Mary last spring. She became
so excited about the prospect of a
similar program here that she con-
tacted St. Jude to see if that was
possible.

According to Dysart, St. Jude
has wanted to start the program at
W&L for years because of our
close—knit community. After hear-
ing that such a program would be
possible here, she took efforts to
put together an executive board
and begin planning for the fall.

Sophomore Kelly Harvey, the
co-publicity chair for the execu-
tive board, said that the focus of
the program is to form teams of
six that will raise money by send-
ing letters to friends and family
asking for donations.

In addition, the teams are free
to do whatever other kinds of
fundraising they can think of.
There will be an event in early
November for all of the teams to

I
write their letters, and then an all

night party in March culminating
the efforts of the year.

It is this event that gives the
club its name. Team members stay}
“up ‘til dawn” to symbolize the
many sleepless nights that parents
spend staying up with their chil-
dren. According to Harvey, how-
ever, “this event is about celebrat’-‘
ing life!”

Tentative plans for the event at
W&L include movies, bands,
food, and games. K

All the members of the execu-
tive board are very excited about
the program here at W&L, espe-
cially Vaughn. pt

She hopes that Up ‘Til Dawry
will be about more than just rais-
ing money for a hospital, but
rather a common cause that the
entire campus can rally around.

Any student at W&L can form!‘
a team with ﬁve other students.
Vaughn also hopes that student
organizations will choose to form
teams to raise money for the cause.

Registration will occur at th
Commons from October 3-7 and
will include a $10 registration fee
known as a “Wig Fee” because it
goes to buying a wig for a child a)‘
the hospital.

Contact the Team Chairs,
Allison Stokan and Christine
Gray, in order to receive a regis-
tration form. A

[Vaughn] hopes- that Up ‘Til Dawn will be about more

than just raising money for a hospital, but rather a common

cause that the entire campus can rally around.

Pannell said, “the program has
a four point approach: Organiza-
tion, Design, Promotion, and Eco-
nomic Development.”

A business must apply and be
accepted to the program, in which
Lexington has been involved since
the early 1980s.

“The first few years were fo-
cused on re-vitalizing downtown
and improving the look of the
area,” Pannell added. For ex-
ample, all of the utility lines are
now buried underground.

In recent years the LDDA has
transitioned and is now working
on getting more people both 10-
cally and outside the area to shop
downtown.”

Panriell said, “Everyone says
that they love our downtown, but
their compliments aren’t very
helpful if they take their shopping
dollars to Charlottesville,
Staunton, or Roanoke.”

Along with the current leader-
ship void at the LDDA, there are
also concerns about high gas
prices hurting tourism in the area.

“Gas prices are a huge concern
for us,” Moore reported. “60-70%
of our business comes through
here between September 1*‘ and
January 1*‘, so we could be in un-

fall.

Lexington business can always
depend on revenue from W&L and
VMI, especially during Home-
coming and Parents’ weekend.

“It’ll be interesting to see how
our peripheral revenue — the
money from casual tourists — is af-
fected by the gas prices,” Moore
said.

“It could be a very interesting
fall.”

Every merchant interviewed
stressed the importance of the two
schools to Lexington.

“It’s a symbiotic relationship,”
Dan Vance said. “You need us;
we need you. The relationship
might ebb and ﬂow a bit, but both
groups still need each other.”

Julie Lindsey said, “Lexington
is different from the rest of the
country; we don’t have a big in-
dustry that employs most of the
town. Lots of people work for the
schools, and those jobs aren’t go-
ing anywhere.”

Though shops come and go,
though the school uses its ever-
fancier bookstore to keep student
dollars on campus, and though gas
prices cloud the economic future
with uncertainty, Lexington’s
downtown businesses are assur-
edly alive and well.

us to see a situation that’s very real
to us and gives us real—life conse-
quences as opposed to hearing
about a something that happened
to a friend of a friend.”

Sterner stressed the same issue
in his speech, noting that most
young people believe nothing bad
ever happens to them, and he be-
lieved it, too.

“I was only 21 years old. Old
people die. You’re not supposed
to die when you’re 21 . . .This kind
of stuff didn’t happen to me. It
happened to other people,” Sterner
said.

He suggested that perhaps stu-
dents may still believe they would
not end up in the same situation.
“Maybe you’re cooler, smarter,
luckier than [I was]. But maybe
you’re not.”

Gold said Stemer’s message
was particularly important for un-
derclassmen to hear so that per-
haps W&L can see changes in the
future.

“[Stemer’s speech is] directed
to all students, but I think it’s par-
ticularly important to get to the
freshmen and sophomores who
still live on campus,” Gold said.

“Then, when many of them live
off campus, they’ll hopefully al-
ways think about Stemer’s story

won’t have to bury one of your
friends or your parents won’t have
to bury you.”

Sterner said that if his audi-
ences could take one piece of ad},
vice with them, it would be to ex-
amine their decisions.

“I’ve spoken to over a million
people and I’ll never know if any
of them listened,” Sterner said. A

“I just want them to realize that
life’s full of choices, and choices
have consequences, even little
ones. Sometimes don’t just think
about yourself.” -"

Gold.is hopeful Stemer’s mes-
sage will reach students and make
a difference.

“If even one person acts dif-
ferently after seeing Sterner talk,"
then it’s been an effective pro-
gram,” Gold said. “And I’m con-
fident that that will happen.”

The lights rise in the Lenfe ,
Center, revealing a chattering au-
dience once Stemer’s speech has
concluded. There is the feeling of
eerie stiffness in the wake of the
powerful words that just ﬁlled th/H
room.

Though some students speak
of going to parties that night, an
extra note of caution resonates in
their voices as they leave the
room.

Intramural sports and com-
petitions are back and better
than ever. Thanks to a com-
plete overhaul of the system
by Campus Recreation Coor-
dinator Will Patterson, IM
competitors at W&L now have
a brand new website, new

equipment, double the amount .

of sports/competitions to do
battle in and a new ultimate
goal to strive for ~ the IM cup.

This year, the intramural
program at W&L has ex-

- pended to an unheard of 24
different competitions from

the expected soccer and ﬂag
football leagues to EA Sports
NCAA 2006, Texas Hold‘em

‘ and dodgeball. Six of the com-

petitions are leagues (both
men’s and women’s) and the
other sixteen are tournaments
or special events.

One of the biggest and
probably most exciting
changes to the IM program
this year is the IM Cup. The
IM Cup, based on similar
competitions in nearby col-
leges, is a year~long competi-
tion spanning the entire IM
repertoire. A team registered
for the IM Cup competes in
many, if not all, of the 24 IM
competitions and the top ten
finishers in the competitions
are awarded points (more
points are allocated to top fin-
ishers in major leagues). At
the end of the year, the team

 with the most points wins the»
” IM Cupiand gets t'c’>'liojl‘d on to “
it until anotherwinner is de-

terrnined. S This year,‘ most of

the IM Cup teams are frater-
nities and sororities but
Patterson hopes that once
word of the competition
spreads, there will be many
more independent teams. Play-

ers without teams can easily ’

form one of their own or join
the free agent list, allowing
teams that need players to eas-
ily ﬁnd them.

Another change that should
make intramural sports more
enjoyable is the launching of
the intramural website (http:/1'
cms.wlu.edu/intramurals/
defaultasp). The website has
all the information someone
interested in IM sports would
need. It features a list of IM
competitions and a registration
schedule, all the forms play-
ers (and IM teams) need to ﬁll
out to compete or to become
free agents. The website fea-
tures all the rules and regula-
tions players must follow in
the individual competition as
well as the IM Cup and the
standings in the current com-
petition.

A quick check of the
website, for example, will an-
swer a question that was fre-
quently asked this year,
whether varsity athletes can
compete in IM sports. The an-
swer is that they can, but not
in the sport that they play var-
sity.

The transformation of the
intramural league is completed
by the purchase of new equip-
ment and the hiring and train-

-ing~of»new officials. Every ef-

'f0'I’2t'h‘<'1S been made to‘make
surethe future of intramural
sports at W&L is a bright one.

Division Picks by Amanda Tholke and Neil Sheaffer
Superbowl Picks by Amanda Tholke, Neil Sheaffer and Jacob Geiger

It’s that time of year again, when every person under the sun thinks they’re an expert on the
NFL. While we are making our picks two weeks in to the season, it’s still just as difficult to predict
how each division will finish. We here at the Phi decided to take our chances and predict how the rest
of the upcoming NFL season will go, knowing that we are probably wrong in at least half of our picks.
Don’t judge us too harshly by our picks as we spent maybe a whole ten minutes thinking these things

through. Thank god football season’s finally here.

Green Bay Packers Seattle Seahawks

Chicago Bears San Fran. 49”"

South

Atlanta Falcons
Carolina Panthers
Tampa Bay Bucs.
New Orleans Saints

East

Philadelphia Eagles
Dallas Cowboys
New York Giants
Washington Redskins

In the NFC, the South looks to be the strong division although the Redskins and Cowboys are making
the East rather interesting. Who would’ve thought that the lousy Redskins would’ve started out 2-0?
The NFC North is ridiculously weaker than everyone would have thought and, despite their crushing of
Detroit last week, I still think Chicago will finish last. The West is again the weakest division by far in
the NFC and probably in the whole NFL. It’s so sad that I can’t stand to watch any of those teams in

that division play.

Cincinnati Bengals San Diego Chargers
Baltimore Ravens Denver Broncos

South

Miami Dolphins

I think that the Cincinnati Bengals are going to surprise everyone this year. I know that’s a popular
sentiment now that they’re undefeated and because they completely dominated Minnesota last week
but I was at that game and I am a die-hard Bengals fan and have been believing this all year. This is the
year that the Bengals go to the playoffs after a 15-year drought. I think they will be Pittsburgh’s
toughest competition in the AFC this year. While the Chargers will slip a little from last year since
they’re still starting Brees when they have a 1*‘ round draft pick on the bench (somebody hasn’t been
watching the Bengals), the Colts and Patriots should still dominate their divisions. I think that the
Dolphins aren’t nearly as good as they looked in Week 1 against Denver and that they just got pumped

up for the home opener with a new coach.

A grey day for the Generals 

By Neil Sheaffer
STAFF WRITER

Under cloudy skies, members
of the Washington and Lee com-
munity, both past and present,
gathered at Wilson Field on Sat-
urday afternoon for a match-up
between the Generals (2-1) and
the Colonels (4-0) of Centre
College.

Fans from both sides were
treated to an exciting game, but
unfortunately for Generals fans,
Centre came away on top with a
35-26 victory.

Centre struck first in the first
quarter with a blocked punt re-
turned for a touchdown. The
Colonels were then able to up
the score to 14-0 with a 31 yard
touchdown pass with just a few
minutes left in the first half.

The Generals were not ready
to go to the locker room just yet
though and with 9.8 seconds left
in the ﬁrst half, senior quarter-
back Greg Tweardy connected
with junior tight end Ryan Neff
for a 16 yard touchdown, which
cut the deﬁcit in half.

The Colonels came out in the
third quarter and were able to in-
crease their lead to 21-7 on an
eight yard run by quarterback
Kevin Phelps.

The Generals were able to re-
spond two plays later when
Tweardy hit sophomore wide re-
ceiver Jack Martin for a 68 yard
touchdown reception.

.The Generals were never able
to catch up to the Colonels, who

followed up Martin’s big recep-
tion with a touchdown pass of
their own.

Stuart Sitterson, a freshman
defensive back, returned the en-
suing kickoff 79 yards for a
score, but the Generals were un-
able to shut down the Colonels
on the other side of the ball.
Centre struck once again at the
beginning of the fourth quarter

with a short touchdown run.
Martin caught a second touch-
down pass from Tweardy with
only three minutes remaining in
the game, but the two point con-
version failed, as did the ensuing
onsides kick attempt. Centre
ended this hard fought game
with the ball as they ran out the
clock for the win.

The Generals’ defense had a

difficult time stopping the C010-
nels, who were able to put 415
total yards on the board. Of
those 417 yards, 260 of them
were gained on the ground
against a very stingy Washington
and Lee defense, which was
ranked second in the country
against the run last year. Mark
Snoddy, a sophomore starter at
comerback, said, “They were

big, fast, really disciplined and
just outmanned us. We also
need to wrap up better.”

In regards to his defense’s in-
ability to stop the run, Washing-
ton and Lee head coach Frank
Miriello said, “You can’t win
games if you can’t stop the run
or run the ball.” The Generals
were able to gain 105 yards
rushing, but this was not enough

L

to beat the Colonels.
Unfortunately, the defense \
wasn’t the only thing that was

not completely on track today. V;

Though the offense racked up

415 yards of total offense, three
chances within the ten yard line
were squandered and no points

were scored on those drives. I’

“You have to put your chin
down and pound the ball when
that close to the goal,” Coach
Miriello replied when asked
about those situations.

The whole game was not
negative for the Generals
though. Quarterback Greg
Tweardy completed 24 of 38
passes for three touchdowns and
only one interception. Receiver
Jack Martin was exceptional,
catching 11 of Tweardy’s 24 re-
ceptions while gaining 206 yards ;
on those plays.

On the defensive side of the
ball, sophomore defensive back
Kyle Luby was the paced the de-
fense with ll tackles and Robert “ix
Foster and Ryan Hoover each
contributed a sack. Sophomore
comerback Kyle Harvey was
complimentary of the Generals’
effort and the Colonels as well.
He said, “Overall it was a great
effort, but we had some prob-
lems on the edge. Also, their
quarterback was a real good ath-
lete.”

Next week, the Generals
travel to Randolph-Macon to
take on the Yellow Jackets.
Kickoff is at 1:00 pm.

Big aspirations dominate W&L

Cheerleading as they move

towards true competition

Cheer ajfjiling at W&L has
changed in B signiﬁcant way
since Jessica Taylor, a 2004
graduate, helped pioneer the
school’s first cheerleading team in
2001

“n Taylor started, she recalled
ng just to maintain a team, often re-
sorting to begging friends and classmates to
try out for the squad.

Today, Taylor ﬁnds herself as Head
Cheerleading Coach and recruiting athletes is
her least concern. “More and more people try
out every year,” said Taylor.

This year, in addition to cheering for W&L
teams, Coach Taylor hopes to compete as a
squad.

“Football and basketball cheerleading is fun
and supporting W&L athletics is our priority,”
said Taylor. “But I would like to see us compete
as a team this year as well.”

In order to create a large enough team, the
Generals plan to unite forces with neighbor, Vir-
ginia Military Institute’s new squad for team
competitions.

“We’re actually trying to become a real
competitive team,” said Taylor.

VMI will add 2 men and 5 women to
Washington and Lee’s 10 member squad.

Because the NCAA does not recognize
cheerleading as a competitive varsity
sport, the Generals will not be able to
compete in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference.

Instead, they will compete in
leagues developed speciﬁcally for
cheerleading, the National
Cheerleading Association (NCA) or
University Cheer Association
(UCA).

“We’ve had to
have some additional
practices to get ready to

compete,” said Taylor.

The competitions in-

clude two- to ﬁve- minute

shows that involve cheering,
stunts, and dancing.
“We’ve been a lot more struc-
tured this year than last year,” said
junior Captain Bree Melton of the
change.
To prepare for the addition of com-
petitive cheerleading, the team hired a
professional instructor during the preseason.
“We started with a lot of new people,”
said Melton. “But they are strong people, we
have a strong coach, and after the camp we’ve
become united as a team.”

Sophomore Nikki Conkling is one of ﬁve
of the new members on W&L’s squad. Though
she has had some experience in tumbling and

dancing, cheerleading is something completely
new. '
“I was really scared at first when I was getting
thrown around,” said Conkling, one of the team
ﬂyers. '
“But I learned to trust my team during camp and
I’ve learned a whole lot and we have been working
really hard as a team.”
Coach Taylor is proud of the progress made but
she’s not ready to settle.
“I would like to see the team progress so that
by the time some of the freshman are seniors,
we can really be recognized as a competitive
team.”
The team hopes that with each year of im-

provement, they will be able to encourage

more fans to come to football and basket-

ball games. “We’re looking for school
spirit,” said Taylor. “And when there are
more fans, we’re a better team.”

  Steer clear

Mark Sterner warns students of the dangers of driving drunk

By Mallory Ruymann
STAFF WRITER

Like most kids here at W&L,
I have gone out a couple of
times. I have had a good time
on several occasions. I’ve even
made some bad decisions.

Most people, however, think
of these episodes as a normal
part ofthe college ‘experience,’
which they can look back on and
laugh about with their friends

. and family.

But just imagine that all
those supposedly good times
abruptly stopped with one bad
night. '

Sure, all of us have heard the
same old ‘I drove drunk and got
in trouble, so don’t be like me’
line in mandatory high school
assemblies. Even though they
had an important message,
never really registered in your
mind and inﬂuenced your deci-
sions the next weekend.

You might have been a pas-
senger in a car with a drunk
driver, or perhaps drove while
drunk, and if you are reading
this you probably didn’t get into
a car accident or kill anyone.

Congratulations, you were
lucky.

Mark Sterner was one of the
unlucky individuals who just
happened to have gotten behind
the wheel drunk, and unlike you,

[His] time at college was mined by the dark

mark of murder: Every time he looks back...

he remembers that he killed three people.
 l

killed three of his best friends
just three months shy of gradu-
ating college.

He now has told his story to
nearly a million students in the
hopes that maybe someone will
listen to him and avoid the mis-
take he made.

As a freshman who has not
experienced much of college-
and who has never been in a

situation on the W&L campus.

where drinking and driving
were involved (thank you Trav-
e1ler)——-I cannot speak for the
whole university ‘in saying how
much of an impact Sterner’s pre-
sentation made.

Conversely, those in the
freshmen class who actually at-
tended the presentation will
agree that such a powerful story
at the beginning of four years,
in which alcohol will definitely
be involved will inﬂuence our
decisions.

W&L has been fabulous thus
far and I want it to stay fabu-
lous until I graduate.

Sterner’s time at college was
ruined by the dark mark of mur-

der. Every single time he looks
back at college, instead of re-
membering good times, friends,
and parties, he remembers that
he killed three people that were
part of all of his other memo-
ries. Even remembering the
little things will connect him
back to that one fateful night.

When I look back at W&L. I
do not want to recall the night
that I killed three of my best
friends. *

All I have to do is stay away
from drinking and driving. This
decision that is made easier be-
cause of the amazing services
of Traveller. Hopefully the
whole campus will do the same,
and from what I have seen, most
of you do.

So, continue to be one of the
lucky people who makes the
right decision. If you have been
drinking, don’t drive or get into
the car with anyone who has
been drinking.

Make decisions so that
when you are eighty and remi-
niscing about college, you have
nothing to regret.

Waves of her own

Senior legacy Kristine Holda makes her mark on the campus

For Kristine Holda, there is
nothing like the song
“Shenandoah” to make you re-
member just where and who you
are.

Holda first set foot on this
campus when she was just eleven.
Holda and her family were cel-
ebrating her father’s 20"‘ year col-
lege reunion. Ken Holda, a Ger-
man and European History major
graduated in 1976. Holda remem-
bers the first visit in crisp detail.

“I loved W&L,” she said. “At
the time, I lived in Chicago, and
it was a miserable spring. I came
out here and the dogwoods were
in bloom, it was warm, things
were green. It was marvelous.”

The Holdas attended a gather-
ing in Lee Chapel, where South-
ern Comfort and Jubilee ended by
singing the folk song. i

“We came out of the chapel and
looked up at the Colonnade,”
Holda remembers. “It was night
— there were stars and George was
lit up. My dad had tears in his eyes
after hearing ‘Shenandoah.’
That’s how I knew this was a spe-
cial place.”

Holda’s mother remembers
that her daughter announced to the
family, “Daddy, I’m gonna come
here.”

Then, Holda appeared as a
Summer Scholar in the summer of
2001. “I felt like a real college
kid,” said Holda, who participated
in the journalism track.

She applied early decision and

was ecstatic when she learned of
her acceptance. “It was the best
Christmas gift I received that
year,” she said.

She arrived on the same carn-
pus on Freshman Move-In Day
that her father had entered 30 years
before. The campus — and the gen-
der of half the student body — had
changed, but W&L was still her
father’s alma mater.

But for Holda, it felt different.
She had visited Lexington many

“I came here and the
dogwoods were in
bloom, it was warm,
things were green. It

was marvelous.”

times and knew people in town,
but she still had the freshman jit-
ters. “When I was a summer
scholar, I knew that if I didn’t like
it, I’d be home in a month,” she
"said. “But this was the real
thing.”

After four years, Holda has
made a place for herself on the
campus with participation in
classes and extra-curricular activi-
ties. And, frequently, that place
is the Cy Twombly Pool.

Holda has swurn all four years
for the Generals, and this year is
co-captain of the women’s team.

Holda holds several school
records with her teammates in the
medley relays.

Swimming is a love for Holda,
who said, “Swimmers are kind of
their own breed. The sport gar-
ners a lot of respect because it is
so intense.”

Swimming, along with being a
sport and hobby, is also a summer
job. Holda spends her Ohio sum-
mers as a lifeguard and swim
teacher in her hometown of
Strongsville.

“As an independent, the swim
team is my sorority,” she always
quips. “I absolutely love those
girls.”

In the spring, Holda will gradu-
ate with a BA. in Biology. She
will then make her waves across
the Atlantic Ocean as she spends
a year abroad in a little — and little-
known — country of Estonia. This
Baltic state holds much signifi-
cance for her. Holda is a second
generation Estonian-American.
She will spend a year at an Esto-
nian university learning the lan-
guage and culture, and as she said,
“immersing myself in my heri-
tage.”

It is an added challenge for all
legacy students here at W&L to
step out of their parents’ shadow
on a campus that often has its gaze
in the past. Holda has taken this
“special place” she discovered
from her father and, as
“Shenandoah” lyrics say, made it
her own “rollin’ river.”

eekend’s homecoming
is were kicked off by a
known but extremely
ted band hailing from
cago, Umphrey’s McGee.
mphrey’s, named the suc-

/S on keyboards, Kris Myers on

drums, and Andy Farag on
secondary percussion.

Umphrey’s played a wide
variety of music, with covers
ranging from Bob Marley’s
“Trenchtown Rock” to a hi-
larious rendition of Biz
Markee’s “Just a Friend”
sung by Ryan Stasik.
Umphrey’s played a mix of
songs off their recent and
critically acclaimed album
Anchor Drops, in addition to
some classics off their older
albums.

Umphrey’s fanatic junior
Joe Green says, “Everyone
who didn’t go to the show
missed out on a great oppor-
tunity. Umphrey’s McGee
will never play this small of a
show again. In two years,
they will be bigger than
Phish. It’s such a treat to be
able to have them come to
W&L.”

Junior Andrew Gulotta

echoed these sentiments,
“this band is at the pinnacle
of musical talent; it’s too bad
they aren’t more well-
known.”

Even people who hadn’t
heard of the band before had
positive reactions. Freshman
Addison Sanford exclaims,
“They were scintillating and
stomp-tacularl Their unique
blend of diverse musical
styles creates a delightful
romp suitable for women and
children alike!”

Umphrey’s McGee is able
to play such a range of styles
because of the diverse musi-
cal backgrounds of all its

, members.

While Umphrey’s plays
mainly rock—based music, lis-
teners get a hint of their
country inﬂuences on Anchor
Drop’s “Bullhead City.”

Guitarist Brendan Bayliss
said he is working with Jeff
Austin of acclaimed blue-
grass band Yonder Mountain
String Band on an acoustic
album “about the trials and
tribulations of life.’’

Bayliss isn’t the only one
channeling some of his en-
ergy into side projects.

Guitarist Jake Cinnger re-
cently released an album with
his old band, Ali Baba’s
Tahini.

Cinniger, inﬂuenced
heavily by Mark Knopﬂer
and his early Dire Straits
work, has brought a distinct

sound to the band since his
induction in 2000.

“I’m a drummer by trade,”
he says, “but my goal is to
play every instrument well.”
He’s already well on his way
to reaching that goal, playing
guitar, bass, violin, banjo,
mandolin, and many other in-
struments. While Umphrey’s
is classiﬁed as a “jam band,”

Cinniger is critical of the
genre. “The problem with
jam bands is that they get
into a good groove, but they
can’t break out of that box;
they’re afraid to stretch it
out. You gotta stretch it out to
keep it interesting.”

Umphrey’s McGee does
just that. The band has a very
unique form of jamming. In-
stead of laying out a chord
progression and improvising
within it, Umphrey’s has
hand signals for a variety of
tricks to pull on stage. They
have signals for each key, in
addition to signals for modu-
lating in various degrees and
returning to previous sections
of a jam.

This way, Umphrey’s en-
sures that every show is
unique and interesting. Be-
cause of the originality of
their jams, some material
from live Umphrey’s shows
actually makes it onto their
studio albums. Anchor
Drop’s “In the Kitchen,”
named Song of the Year at
the J ammy’s award festival,

was inspired by live perfor-
mances.

,, Despite the recent release
of Anchor Drops, fans can
expect a new Umphrey’s al-
bum to be hitting shelves
within the next few months.
The band has been debuting
a plethora of new material
that should find its way onto
a record sometime soon.

The band has also recently
produced a new DVD,
Wrapped Around Chicago,
which will be released on
October 16. Bayliss says the
new disc should be even bet-
ter than 2002’s Live from the
Lake Coast Skyline Stage.

Bayliss is confident that
college radio will continue to
help with band recognition.

“You pull into a town like
Lexington, and you’re getting
free advertising. It creates a
buzz on campus; usually
people like to listen to things
that they’re recommended to,
not what they’re told, and
college radio does that. It’s a
legitimate voice because it’s
not corporate.”

Tune into 91.5 WLUR on
Thursday from 5-7 PM and
Friday from 12-2 AM for a
sampling of Umphrey’s
tunes. .

If they come to your
hometown this summer, don’t
hesitate to buy tickets, be-
cause it won’t be long before
they are going to be the hot-
test ticket around.

Moon Men

Caley Anderson and Justin McKeen sound oﬁ’ on both sides of the moon mission argument

SHEER LUNACY

By Caley Anderson
STAFF COLUMNIST

President Bush seems bent on
increasing spending while simul-
taneously decreasing revenue.
The present administration has
laid out its $100 billion plus plan
to return Americans to the moon.

Put simply, the nation has bet-
ter problems to deal with than a
return to the moon. Our national
resources are strained. We are en-
gaged in a protracted foreign war
and already costing billions. We
have just witnessed the practical
destruction of New Orleans.

Why? NASA’s administrators
maintain that investment in con-
tinued manned lunar landings is a
long-terrn investment; much like
a European investment in the New
World circa 1492.

They say that it will be well
worth the cost in thelong run.
They say that if we do not get our
exploration and researching now,
other countries will beat us to the
punch of moon colonization.

What is bad about this mission
is the timing- last I checked,
China’s moon mission is going to
be basic and exploratory, much
like the Apollo missions of the
1960s.

China, in other words, is not
going to be calling first dibs on
the moon unless we get there first.
We can debate all we want

whether the administration is sim-
ply throwing out the moon mis-
sion as a way to distract Ameri-
cans from other problems, but the
fact is that China will get there
first whether we start now or not-
we’d be ready to go in 2018, and
China, by even the most conser-
vative account, probably won’t
delay their program past 2012.

And as in the Cold War, we
should be wary of a “get there
first” mentality— national security
is NOT a serious factor in support
of a space program.

We should worry first about
how to preserve national security
planet side.

The very first mission to reach
the moon (though not land on it)
was Apollo 1.

Apollo 1 never got off the

ground- during a test run through»

launch procedures, the entire com-
mand capsule assembly was en-
gulfed in ﬂames, burning to death
all three of the astronauts inside.
Ominous precedent indeed for
NASA given their recent troubles.

Should we eliminate space pro-
gram funding altogether? N 0. We
should maintain an investment in
the future that space exploration
represents. Should we abandon all
hope of returning to the moon?

No, we should just wait until a’

more opportune time. The condi-
tions, at present, do not justify
another moon mission.

BEAM ME UP

By Justin McKeen
STAFF COLUMNIST

When Neal Armstrong took
mankind’s first steps on the moon
in 1969, it was a momentous oc-
casion, for the world and espe-
cially for America. Early this
week, NASA unveiled an ambi-
tious plan for the next 13 years.
Making good on the words of
President Bush in 2004, NASA
says it will put astronauts on the
moon in 2018; the first time men
will have visited the moon since
the Apollo 17 mission in 1972.

Immediate concerns have
sprung up around the proposed
plan. In the wake of devastating
natural disasters and skyrocketing
costs in Afghanistan and Iraq,
some Congressmen and pundits
are claiming the space program is
a waste of money—money that
could be better spent elsewhere.
They couldn’t be more wrong.

Like 1969, American today
faces an uncertain world where
danger seems omnipresent. Also
like 1969, our society is divided
over important issues, both at
home and abroad, to the point that
civil discourse seems to have bro-
ken down, and we are reduced to
a state of partisan bickering and
finger-pointing.

As sad as it is to say, it seems
unlikely that these rifts are going
to heal anytime soon. No matter

how many support-our-troops
bumper stickers are out there, con-
tention over the war in Iraq will
continue. Arguments over welfare
and gay marriage will continue.
But in the midst of all these frac-
tious issues, we have a chance to
come together as a country and
achieve something that, for the
greatest course of human history,
was an unthinkable dream.

The cost of the plan is 104 bil-
lion dollars, but spaced over thir-
teen years, it falls within NASA’s
l6—billion a year budget. The sci-
entiﬁc beneﬁts are more question-
able (NASA hopes to ascertain
whether or not ice exists on the
moons south pole), but many of
the technologies that we take for
granted today are an outgrowth of
past space—related research.

It is important that help reach
those devastated by hurricane
Katrina. It is important that the
troops in Iraq and Afghanistan re-
ceive the equipment and support
they need. But it is also important
that America continue to lead the
way in exploring space and hu-
manities place in it. We can ac-
complish that goal without weak-
ening our response to tragedy,
without abandoning prior commit-
ments, and what’s more we can
instill in ourselves a sense of ca-
maraderie and accomplishment
that is sadly lacking in our society
today.

‘Hispanic’ not sufﬁcient

Label creates confusion and a too-large, non-diverse category for a wide array of people

By Alejandro Selin
GUEST COLUMNIST

The September 15”‘ edition of
Campus Notices marked the be-
ginning of a series of messages
announcing Hispanic Heritage
Month.

The notice was accompanied
by a few words from Linda
Alvarado, owner of the Colorado
Rockies franchise: “Whether
we’re called Hispanos or
Mexicanos or Puertorriquefios,
Cubanos, or Latinos, we are a fam-
ily connected to a community of
very talented people from very
different backgrounds who are
doing amazing things that our par-
ents did not have the opportunity
to do.”

Now, what exactly does it mean
to be family “from very different
backgrounds”?

To the American mind His-
panic is a race, on par with White,
Black, American Indian and East
Asian. American institutions cer-
tainly do their part to perpetuate
this conception, as the many forms
which list Hispanic as a distinct
race or ethnicity testify.

In truth Hispanic, as the word
is regularly used today, encom-
passes people of all races.

Examples of some famous
people considered Hispanics will
suffice to prove this.

Cameron Diaz is a Cuban-
American actress of European an-

cestry.

word to the book The Future Is

mix of White and American In-

And former Peruvian Presi-
dent Alberto Fujimori was born in
Lima to Japanese parents.

Four people——-of four different
races, ‘from very different back-
grounds’——arc all part of the same
family? They are all—Hispanics?

It would seem foolish to
Americans to label themselves as
Britannic, including in the word’s
deﬁnition Canadians, Nigerians,
East Indians and people of every
other English—speaking country in

the world.

Why would one want to call
oneself a Britannic if the term had
such a wide and nebulous appli-
cation? Should European-Ameri-
cans have to choose between
White and Britannic on a form?

Or should African-Americans
lose their identity and be grouped
with Whites as Britannics, be-
cause they are from an English-
speaking country?

The idea is ridiculous, of
course, but it is no different to the
idea behind popular usage of the
word Hispanic. For, just like those
from English-speaking countries,
people from Spanish-speaking
countries are of different racial
families. Hispanic, quite simply,
will not do.

THE RING-TUM PHI ' 9

4 013 your normal Facing Off
, college football spirit

Sundresses somewhat lackluster when it comes to pigskin pride

By Carissa Shipley

STAFF COLUMNIST

Tonight, my friends and family from
home are heading to a Friday night lights
football game. If I were still in high
school, I would have gone to school to-
day decked out in blue and gold.

And I mean decked out. My best
friend and I dressed as twins in blue ath-
letic pants with gold stripes down the
side, blue or yellow Rampart High
School t-shirts and blue and gold rib-
bon halos.

Our nails were painted blue and gold
and I wouldn’t let my parents buy me
any tennis shoes that didn’t have some
kind of blue speciﬁcally for the days of
home football games.

While you might be thinking other-
wise, no one actually thought I was a
nerd as I ran from class to class, the
colored ribbons streaming out behind
me. They didn’t even think I was a nerd
as Itopped the whole ensemble with my
letter jacket or painted my face.

This was because everyone else was
dressed the same way. The kid who wore__
a Rampart t-shirt with his jeans was the
big loser. Where was his spirit anyway?

Fast forward to college.

I was ready to meet the Greeks on
one of my ﬁrst weekends here and I got
ready in my tailgate clothes. I ﬁgured
the sweatpants might be. a little much
and put on jeans with a t-shirt from the
first load of W&L clothes I purchased.

I was on my way out the door when
the RA stopped me, gently explaining
what it’s like here.

Turns out that what it’s like here is
actually minimal school spirit, rarely
shown, and certainly not appropriate for
football games (besides the occasional
cheer from the less-than-packed sta-
dium).

I ﬁnd this extremely strange consid-
ering that there is a community kind of
feeling.

As I surf facebook, 1 see that people
have friends from various frats and srats
and while everybody doesn’t always

Feeling fratty enough, Ben Kapur combined Generals formal fratwear and traditional
football paint for a true-blue pigskin look on Saturday's homecoming game.

_ love everyone else, I think we all get

along fairly well.

So why don’t we celebrate the insti-
tution that brought us all together, where
we live and work and play?

I blame the atmosphere. Who wants
to feel obligated to look their best in
roasting heat or freezing wind?

I am personally more likely to skip a
game I want to see when I know my skirt
will lead to purple legs and I can’t just
throw on my W&L sweatshirt.

Risky surgery improves quality of life

By Casidhe Horan
STAFF COLUMNIST

Matthew Teffeteller knows pain well.
Pain from having lost his wife to a ﬁre.
Pain from having his face severely burned
as he tried to save his wife. Pain from
having dozens of reconstructive surger-
ies on his face. Pain from the inﬂamma-
tion and staph infections caused by fes-
tering hairs of his old beard that is now
covered in a crust of skin grafts.

Mr. Teffeteller and others who have to
live with this kind of pain often undergo
numerous reconstructive surgeries in an
attempt to repair the face. Skin grafts
from a person’s back, legs, arms, or but-
tocks are used to create a patchwork of
grafts and scar tissue that do not look or
move like healthy skin. Often, dozens of
surgeries are required because only a little
bit of skin can be grafted at a time in or-
der to prevent severe Ueeding. Pain is a
given. Returning the patient’s appearance
to what it once was is too often out of the
question.

But now a new treatment has come to
the forefront of scientific and medical
controversies: the face transplant. The
process would first identify a deceased
skin donor matching the skin tissue, age,
race, and sex of the recipient. An inci-
sion would be made and the face would
be “degloved” from the cadaver, as the
skin with eyelids, lips, crucial blood ves-
sels, and nerves would be removed. The
damaged skin from the recipient would
also be removed. Surgeons would then
align the new face with the existing nose,
eyes, and cheekbones of the recipient,
giving shape to the ﬂap of skin. Blood
vessels and muscles would also be con-
nected. Post-surgery, anti-rejection drugs
would be taken for the rest of the patient’s
life.

Some leading transplant specialists
hope to perform the world’s first face
transplant by the end of this year.

Outrageous? Unbelievable?
Face transplantation reflects the closing
gap between the impossible and reality
thanks to science and technology. And
as that gap gets smaller and smaller, it is
imperative that we confront the complex
questions that need to be asked.

Scientifically, what makes a
face a face? A face is more than just a
piece of skin. A face is expressions.
Winking, smiling, crying and all the other
expressions that make us human are
linked to the brain; they are not embed-
ded in the skin .

Scientiﬁcally, at what point can we
declare doctors prepared and skilled
enough to perform such risky surgery?
Face transplantation seems like such an
unknown that it may seem as though we
should have more evidence or practice
before actually perfomiing the procedure
on a person. At the same time, there has
to be a first, and there has to be a risk
because no risk often means no gain.

What does face transplantation mean
for the donor? Should a skin donor be
automatically considered a face donor as
well? Donating skin from the arm seems
less emotional or complicated than donat-
ing a face. Perhaps there should be two
options: skin and/or face donors.

What does it mean for the recipient?
Identity crisis and emotional instability
are possible psychological consequences.
Will wearing someone else’s face have a
negative effect? On the other hand, per-
haps a new face will lead to a new lease
on life — a strengthened psychological
state.

And what about the family of the do-
nor? What will it be like for the family to
see their loved one’s face on a stranger?
Or vice versa, what will it be like for the
family of the recipient to see a stranger’s
face on their loved one? We don’t know
right now. Maybe it will be nothing.
Maybe it will hurt. Maybe it will be a
new emotion that we can’t understand
until it happens.

Ethically, The Royal College of
Surgeons in London and The French Na-
tional Ethics Advisory Committee have
already stated that the surgery should not
be done because of patient selection and
informed consent. The doctors interested
in performing the surgery insist they will
only select patients deemed psychologi-
cally ﬁt or strong. Ironically, it is pos-
sible those who are most interested in face
transplantation may be the least psycho-
logically stable.

The doctors also promise to use in-
formed consent. Informed consent is de-
ﬁned as the consent by a patient to a sur-
gical or medical procedure or participa-
tion in a clinical study after achieving and
understanding the relevant medical facts
and risks involved. Those in London and
France have argued that informed consent
is not possible because doctors are not
fully aware of what the consequences may
be, and so it is impossible for the patient
to be adequately informed.

Morally, can we justify the risks in a
non—life-or—death situation? On the ﬂip
side, can we deny someone in intense pain
potential relief? Is it moral to do this for
cosmetic reasons? How do we draw the
line between medical necessity and cos-
metic desire? We may need to set guide-
lines outlining what level of pain and suf-
fering justifies such treatment - but how
do we do that?

Finally, what does this mean to us as a
society? For instance, who’s going to pay
for this? Insurance? Another means?

Also, plastic surgery started as a medi-
cal practice to heal, but evolved into a
cosmetic industry. Looking down the
road ahead, does face transplantation have
that potential? Could we have people
switching faces? Shows- such as “The
Swan” could take on a whole new shock-
value.

Teffeteller and those in severe pain like
him deserve to have their pain eased. Face
transplantation has the potential power to
do this. It is also representative of the
trend of more and more amazing, yet in-
credibly complex, innovations, as well as
the accompanying dilemmas we face in
the future.

Face transplantation is, no doubt, a
tough issue. Today, we’ve not yet had to
deal with the transplantation of something
so closely tied to identity. And right now,
it seems to new and there is too much
unknown to deﬁnitely rule it in or out yet.

One thing is for sure, though: before
we proceed, we need to make sure we
know what we’re doing. We must ask the
right questions and answer them. And we
need to do this not just for face transplan-
tation, but for future innovations as well,
which are sure to be even more compli-
cated. The better we can tackle these
questions so that we have a clear under-
standing of the far-stretching conse-
quences, the better science and technol-
ogy can continue to improve our lives.

UPS 8: DOWNS

Opinions writer Caley Anderson
gives his take on the good, the
bad, and the ugly.

0 Hurricane Rita. You
have to be shaking your head
if you’re from the gulf coast
region right about now.

0 “Head Cases.” When a
show gets canceled after only
two airings on FOX, you
know it can’t be that good.

0 Lex Weather. Unusually
hot this week. That probably
means we can predict snow
for next week.

0 The Apprentice:
Martha Stewart. “The
reason this company has been
so successful is that we
connect each and every day,”
said Martha to her eager
contestants. Sometimes, we
EVEN connect with our
stockbrokers about secret
corporate information!

0 Iraq Doctrine. Bush
says that withdrawing from
Iraq now “Would make the
world more dangerous.” He’s
absolutely right. The
questionable decision is going
in there and destabilizing
things in the first place.
Nevertheless, we should
realize that leaving a void in
the Middle East now would
be disastrous. It’s too late for
the American public to back
off now- if you supported the
war in the beginning, you
ought to continue doing so.

0 Homecoming. Great
food and great friends. A little
overcast at the game but at
least your sundresses didn’t
get wet...

0 Ditching Your Date.
You either asked or got asked
to homecoming. That doesn’t
give you permission to bail.

Rape on t  e rise

Enclosed environment and Greek atmosphere create negative setting for sexual situations on campus

By Alexa Moutevelis
STAFF COLUMNIST

It’s the beginning of the third
full week of classes and chances
are that some girls reading this
have already been sexually as-
saulted.

For all you freshmen or anyone
else that doesn’t know this: Wash-
ington and Lee University has a
problem with sexual assault on
campus.

Last year a survey found that
our school has a higher rate of
sexual battery, attempted rape and
rape than the national average of
colleges participating in the sur-
vey. The numbers are as follows:

Sexual Battery (Sexual touch-
ing against their will): W&L -
22.6%, national average - 11.9%

Attempted Rape (Attempted
sexual penetration against their
will): W&L - 8.5%, national
— 3.9%

Rape (Sexual penetration

against their will): W&L - 2.6%,
national - 1.9%

For all these percentages, only
2 sexual assaults were officially
reported last year. This has to stop.

I think a major part of the prob-
lem with reporting and girls get-
ting help is the intense rumor mill
combined with the Greek atmo-
sphere. Let’s look at a hypotheti-
cal situation in which a freshman
girl is sexually assaulted. In such
a small school, someone would
find out and that someone would
tell others and it would spread;
probably including catty com-
ments about the girl’s behavior
and promiscuity. If the perpetra-
tor were a well known frat guy, the
frat would presumably rise up to
defend him along with their srat
friends. This can affect which
sorority she gets into and even if
she gets into one at all. It may be
so bad that she ends up having to
transfer. The girl has no chance
to defend herself and is, ﬁgura-

tively, assaulted again.

The same can happen if it is an
upperclassman woman, or the as-
sailant is a freshman guy. There
are definite social consequences,
although they may not be as ex-
trerne.

I believe this fear of being os-
tracized is what drives women to
keep their assault a secret. Un-
fortunately, keeping it a secret can
exacerbate the emotional and
spiritual problems that come with
sexual assault.

This is what concerns me the
most. I would like our campus to
get to a point where a sexual as-
sault victim can report without
getting blamed by society, but un-
til that time, we have to take care
of the women who need help but
are afraid to speak up.

Women: If you have been
sexually assaulted, please talk to
someone. There are numerous
organizations on campus as well
as local and state support groups.

You can be anonymous and you
don’t have to report who was in-
volved if you don’t want to. The
important thing is that you get
help.

If you have not been sexually
assaulted, please be sensitive to
those that have been. Don’t be so
quick to denounce girls as sluts;
you don’t know what really hap-
pened. Always watch out for your
friends and take care of yourself.

Men: Ifthe girl you have your
eye on is very drunk — steer clear.
She could be blacked out and
therefore unable to give consent
and that is sexual assault. Also, if
you want to hook up with a girl
and she’s not that interested, don’t
even think about giving her more
to drink so she’ll say yes. Don’t
get too drunk yourself so you
don’t know whether or not she’s
consenting.

You can also be supportive of
women that have been sexually
assaulted and ﬁnd out more infor-

mation from 1 in 4, an all-male
sexual assault peer education
group on campus.

region. Will the Palestinians ﬁ-
nally gain sovereignty in a peace-
ful way? Will the Israeli govem—
ment reassert power over Gaza
again in the near future? Or will
terrorist organizations such as
Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Is-
lamic Resistance Movement ruin
these positive developments?

My hope is that the first sce-
nario becomes a reality. I had the
fortune of living the Middle East
for two years, but each day sad
news about Israel and Palestine
filled the newspapers with little
hope in sight. Stories of carnage
and vivid photographs from both
perspectives filled the news. Now,
with some light at the end of the
tunnel, what has to be done to
maintain peace and order in the
region?

Mahmoud Abbas, the prime
minister of Palestine, finds the ball
in his court to respond to the re-
cent moves made by the Israeli
government. I believe that Abbas
can and will lead the Palestinian
people towards sovereignty. How-

ever, Abbas finds himself in a very
awkward spot. He leads a group
of passionate, proud people who
have lived in this land for thou-
sands of years, but have no coun-
try of their own. Abbas must ap-
peal to the United States and Is-
rael, who are the main obstacles
in his efforts to achieve the ulti-
mate goal of Palestinian sover-
eignty. Can Abbas hold the trust
of his people while working with
the perceived “enemies”? My
guess is that he will have to take
small, certain steps before he can
achieve any great success.

Most importantly, Abbas must
first make a concerted effort to
eliminate the inﬂuence that Pal-
estinian terrorist organizations
exert upon the people. I have al-
ways been a supporter of Pales-
tinian independence, but Abbas
must prove to the world that his
country will not be a source of glo-
bal terrorism. Abbas has the po-
tential to pull this off, though the
sheer magnitude of terrorist
groups will make it difficult.

Second, Abbas should go to the
United Nations (useless, but still
a good ﬁgurehead) and the United
States (or any other “major” coun-

try of his choice) and ask for me- .

diation between Israel and Pales-
tine. Normalized relations be-
tween Abbas and Ariel Sharon
would help their respective coun-
tries and the entire region. Mus-
lim countries like Qatar and Paki-
stan recently revitalized ties by
meeting with Israeli representa-
tives to discuss the Gaza with-
drawal. Pakistani president Pervez
Musharraf even shook hands and
exchanged pleasantries with
Sharon, an action unheard of in
recent history.

Like myself, President Bush
sees hope in the situation. The
president recently said in New
York, “The opportunity rests with
the Palestinian people to show
they can govern themselves in a
peaceful way.” I am happy to see
that Bush supports the idea of Pal-
estinian independence if the Pal-
estinians show a commitment to

peace. I hope he means what he
said because his relationships with
Israel and Palestine aren’t what
one could call level handed.

The light at the end of the tun-
nel grows brighter as each day
passes. I now go to news websites
any chance I get to see if there are
any new developments out of the
Middle East. I loved my time in
the Middle East and I hope that
many other people will be able to
experience the wealth of culture
that I enjoyed during my many
trips in the area. The stability of
the region hinges on the relation-
ship between Palestine and Israel
and, like the optimist I try to be, I
see hope for the near future.

Tulane,‘Taradlse,’ 

and tailgating  

Mourning the loss of the football game tailgate I ‘

By Hugh Trout
STAFF COLUMNlS“l'

Welcome back Generals
and an especially warm wel-
come goes out to the new
freshmen (I hear they drink a
lot of alcohol. . and Iknow it’s
true because I hear it from the
freshmen themselves at almost
every party . . . sweet). Also,
Tulane students get a shout out
and I look forward to having a
few drinks with you all
throughout the semester.

Let us recap the greatest
recent developments in the
global community. First off,
Tara Reid has her own reality
show called Taradise and it is
delicious. Thanks Tara from
every college aged guy in
America. This is a huge de-
velopment seeing how many
top Hollywood starlets are
turning less than desirable
(Brittany Spears, Lindsay
Lohan, pretty much everyone).

Second off, it would be
wrong to not even mention the
departure of our late President.
Most of my friends and stu-
dents in general will speak of
him as if he shot their dog, and
I too am certainly glad to see
him go. He simply wasn’t a
W&L kind of guy. My hope is
that the next President is a
W&L alumnus, but I’ ll keep an
open mind no matter what.

Alright, but now it’s down
to business...the real issue at
hand. What is this pressing is-
sue that we must devote our
attention to‘? Simple: tailgat-
ing. Speciﬁcally, how badly it
needs to come back in full
force to this campus. It’s a
college rite of passage: living
in a dorm room, studying hard,
meeting people, getting drunk
out of the back of a parked
SUV. In fact, one of my fa-
vorite events all year,
Foxfields, is really just a tail-

gate in a field for a sporting
event people are honest enough
to say they don’t even care
about. Our sports teams de-
serve to allow their fans to tail-
gate. Everyone knows that this
school’s speaking tradition is
at it’s best when everyone has
had a few drinks in them, and
so being against tailgating is
really just a thinly veiled way
of being against not only
W&L, but happiness, sunshine,
and to be honest, America.
And if we just give up tailgat-
ing then the evildoers win.
First tailgating, then What’s
next? Democracy? Laughter?
It’s just wrong.

Sure, technically you. can
tailgate before a game and then
go, but I’m talking about old
school W&L tailgating; real
tailgating. The whole school
hanging out together in the sun
and doing what W&L does
best. Don’t get me wrong,
watching games is fun in its
own right, but like most forms
of reading and mathematics, it
can be improved with some
good drinks and friends.

I know that many people i
believe that any new adrninis~ .

tration would never allow tail-
gating to come back, but I ‘m
optimistic. You may say I’m a
dreamer, but Pm not the only
one. Imagine all the.people,
drinking in a parking lot to-
gether. I will ﬁght for the glo-
rious invention John S. Tail-
gate gave us’ so many years ago,
and I hope you will too. If we
let them take this, who knows,
maybe they will go as far as to
mess with the Trident or even
try to rename the co-op. I know
that sounds like it could never
happen, but give them an inch,
and they’ll want to turn your
college into someplace as so-
cially uncomfortable as watch-
ing a Girls Gone Wild commer-
cial with your parents.

Two new staff members add their flair and finesse to powerful positions

Jason Rodocker
“My long-term goal [is] to one day be
president at a small college like this.”

By Emily Peck
STAFF WRITER

W&L has a new director of
Student Activities and Greek Life
this year, Mr. Jason Rodocker.

Mr. Rodocker is originally
from Indianapolis, Indiana and
graduated from Hanover College
with a degree in Communications
and Business Management.

After graduating, Mr.
Rodocker worked for the gover-
nor of Indiana for one year and
then spent three years at_Indiana
University obtaining a law degree
and a Master’s of Higher Educa-
tion Administration.

When asked what brought him
to W&L, Mr. Rodocker re-
sponded, “It was really the per-
fect opportunity for me. My long
term goals are to one day be a
dean of students at a small col-
lege like this and to be president
of a small college like this.”

Mr. Rodocker said his job will
enable him to work towards those
aspirations.

Mr. Rodocker noted that one
of the great aspects of his posi-
tion as director is that it allows
him to oversee four key compo-
nents of campus life: student ac-
tivities, housing, judicial issues,
and Greek life.

When asked what a typical day
as director of his ofﬁce was like,
Mr. Rodocker answered that his

job was busier than some might
expect.

On any average day he re-
ceives 100-150 e-mails and
twenty phone calls. Mr. Rodocker
also spends a lot of time prepar-
ing for meetings, participating in
meetings, and meeting with stu-
dents.

Mr. Rodocker also remarked
that his dinner plans for the next
three weeks are set since he will
be eating chapter dinners with
various, fraternities and sororities
on campus and talking with house
directors.

Mr. Rodocker also commented
about his future plans for student
activities.

He said that students who re-
viewed the ofﬁce last year recom-
mended that instead of focusing
on a larger number of activities,
the ofﬁce should focus on mak-
ing a fewer number of activities
bigger and better.

Mr. Rodocker said that he will
strive to move his ofﬁce in that
direction this year.

Some of the activities coming
up in the next few weeks include
an X-Box game zone on two,
twelve-foot Television screens
this Wednesday and a game of
lazer tag on the Canaan Green on
October 19.

Mr. Rodocker is glad to be at
W&L and says that he loves his
job.

A April Washburn

“I have yet to meet anyone
who didn’t greet me with a smile.”

By Nadja Wolfe
STAFF WRITER

The Phi is happy to welcome
Mrs. April Washburn to her new
position as Administrative Assis-
tant for Campus Activities and
the Elrod Commons.

Mrs. Washbum had worked
part time in the Instructional
Technology Lab for the past two
years before succeeding Carol
Calkins in this position.

Mrs. Washburn has many re-
sponsibilities throughout her day
which vary from organizing stu-
dent activity room reservations to
setting up fundraising tables, as
well as administrative and cleri-
cal duties.

Her day usually begins with a
walkthrough to make certain that
everything is alright and in place.

After that, it’s set up, phone
calls, and as many as sixty emails
in a day (although she’s grateful
that doesn’t happen very often),
as well as a myriad of other tasks.

The W&L community has
made Mrs. Washbum feel right at
home in her new capacity.

“I have yet to meet anyone
who didn’t greet me with a smile
and a ‘Glad to see you’re here’
or ‘Nice to see your face
around,’” she said. “I wouldn’t
want [the transition] any other

99

way.

Other staff have been helpful as
well, including Mrs. Calkins, who,
having held the post for over
twenty years, is a wealth of infor-
mation and has made herself avail-
able to her successor.

One of Mrs. Washburn’s favor-
ite things about her new position
is that she gets to see more of W&L
students, especially for club
events, activities, and all sorts of
other important information.

Her pleasant personality and
smiling face are sure to greet ev-
eryone who comes to her office
and make them feel at home.

One need only to look at the pa-
pers from campus-wide groups in
neat piles in her office to know
they’re in good hands.

When not at work, Mrs.
Washbum likes to relax with her
family, including two sons, read,
and watch movies.

She also spends time coaching
volleyball, her lifelong passion, at
the local high school.

Since playing in grade school,
coaching has been a dream of hers,
and today she’s in her third year of
coaching at the high school.

Mrs. Washburn also likes to use
volleyball to bridge the gap be-
tween the university and the town.

Since last year, RCHS and
W&L volleyball players have at-
tended each others games.

This is just another aspect of her
welcoming and kind character.

Keep an eye out each week as we proﬁle staﬁ” and faculty members throughout the year:
Be sure and get to know your community and join the Phi in welcoming and celebrating our neighbors.’

With the growing pres-

Avoid red-eye.
Look directly into a light until
just before the photo is taken.

glare from the ﬂash.

Create a slim silhouette.
Turn your body to a 45-degree
angle as you pose. This em-

Reduce shine.

Use transculent powder to ab-
sorb the oil that reﬂects light
from the camera ﬂash.

Compose yourself.

Make sure to stand up
straight, with shoulders back.
This creates a more positive
look, so you don’t look bored
or lazy.

Loosen up.

Joke, laugh, make a

lax your facial features. Try
not to make your smile look

symmetrical, you have one.
Find out what it is, and make
sure it’s facing the camera for
the best possible angle.

As thenumber of Williams school majors continues to grow, competing departments may suffer

By Wes O’De|I
REPORTER

To some, it might seem para-
doxical that one of the nation’s top
liberal arts institutions boasts a
thriving school of school of busi-
ness.

But the century-old Williams
School of Commerce, Economics
and Politics has excelled in its
unusual niche, expanding its fa-
cilities, increasing its faculty and
providing a variety of unique re-
search and study-abroad programs
for its students, growing to the
point that 40% of W&L students
now take a major from it.

Prof. Larry Peppers, Dean of
the School, credits the quality of
the school for its success and
growth.

Becoming bigger in a physical
sense, however, may be a neces-
sity. The School’s strategic plan

calls for the construction of new
facilities or the renovation of the
old co-op to house currently dis-
placed faculty and staff.

“We have a lot of faculty at this
point in time that are spread out
all over campus,” he said.

Both space and money, how-
ever, are at a premium at W&L,
and the opinions regarding which
building should be the next reno-
vated are as diverse as the depart-
ment chairs themselves.

He singles out Newcomb Hall,
which he says needs to be “taken
back to the rafters and
rebuilt. . .We’re just bursting at the
seams.”

He implicates the successive
renovations of Huntley Hall as
evidence of the C-school beneﬁt-
ing at the expense of the college,
but is quick to point out that “it’s
not just [them], I’m not trying to
set them up as a target,” mention-

ing also recent construction in the
departments of journalism, sci-
ence and law, which he says have
faired “extremely well.”

“We’ve gotten far, far less than
we need and deserve,” he contin-
ued, “we [in the humanities] have
been treated like poor relations.”

Prof. James Warren, Chair of
the English Dept., points out that
while both the College and the
Williams School beneﬁt from any
renovations, the renovation of the
Leybum Library “is frankly more
important to me than the C-school,
which already has a nice building.
And we won’t even talk about
Reid Hall, wonderful as it is.”

Faculty and staffing issues are
also contentious.

The History department, ac-
cording to Prof. Merchant, is un-
derstaffed by three professors, and

tion from seven to six courses

Fraternities react effectively to threat of :armedvdeserter..

A party at thejsigrna Chi
fraternity house was disrupted
two weeks ago by an armed
man. -
Daniel McCellan, who is 35

, years old, is currently wanted
by the United States Navy for
desertion. When he was ar-
rested in front of Kappa Sigma,
he wasdiscovered to be carry-
ing a Berretta .380 caliber pis-
tol, a clip of bullets and two
knives.

He did not, however, show
these weapons while he was
inside the fraternity house.

Bruce Beard, Lex'mgton’s
Chief of Police, said the in-
truder was in the custody of
W&L Security Officer Larry
Stewart when two officers ar-

. rived at 12:15 am. on Satur-
day, September 17"‘.

Stewart went to the house

‘shortly after an officer of

Sigma Chi had asked McCellan to
leave the fraternity’s property and
the trespasser “bolted when con-
fronted.”

Noticing the strong smell of
alcohol and the glazed look in
Stewart’s eyes, the police arrested
him on charges of trespassing and
being drunk in public (DIP).

While searching McCel1an, the
officers discovered the pistol and

knives, so a warrant for the charge‘

of carrying a concealed weapon
was promptly obtained.

Upon returning to the station,
the police discovered that
McCellan, who listed a Sarasota,
Florida address as his current resi~
deuce, is wanted by the Navy on
desertion charges. ,

‘ After getting in touch with
military police, Beard says the
department was asked to “hold
onto him until the government
authorities could come get him.”

The Chief said that McCe1lan
may never stand trial ‘in

Rockbridge County because of the ‘

qfederal desertion charge,

which receives priority over“;

any s_tate.critne_s. — .

Michael Young, W&L’s 'Di- I
rector of Canipus Security  -
a military veteran, notedthat

_“the government‘ ‘doesn.’t look
“too kindlyon people who

desert during a war. lie could I
be looking at 20 years in prison

. for trying to runaway.”

that even Lexington is not im-by "

Beard further emphasized
that he hopes this incident will

eially female ones, to take care“ 1

threatens course offerings in some
departments unless new faculty
are hired to preserve current
courses.

However, Prof. William Ses-
sions, Philosophy Dept.
Chair,points out that the college’s
liberal arts focus goes hand in
hand with that of the Williams
school, saying “liberal learning...
turns out to be the most
useful. . .for leaders.”

.In the midst of these economic
issues lies the central paradox of
a business school within a nation-
ally-ranked liberal arts institution.

Prof. Merchant expressed dis-
tress that too large a percentage of
C-school majors will cause W&L
to lose its standing in national
polls as a small liberal arts school.

Prof. Sessions agreed, saying,
“the number of applied area ma-
jors shouldn’t be overwhelming,”
while adding that the percentage

of students taking majors from the
C-school can be misleading, as
many double major in the college.

University Registrar Scott
Dittman reports that 28% of last
year’s graduating C-school majors
also took a major in the college.

He did, however, concede the
recruitment draw of the C-school,
while adding, “you would never
want to see the day that W&L
would be looked at as a business
school first and a liberal arts col-
lege second...that would be sad.”

The faculty remain united in
their feeling that any improvement
beneﬁts the whole.

The general feeling of the fac-
ulty was summed up by Prof. Ses-
sions, who said, “It’s extremely
important not to get into an
adversarial or antagonistic rela-
tionship here and to think this is a
zero—sum game where their gain is
our loss.”

Ventura brings controversial views to the pulpit

By Mallory Ruymann
REPORTE R

Jesse Ventura is a man of
many faces.

For example, he is a naval
officer, former pro—wrest1er, and
a former governor, which he
described as a transient phase in
his life

Why Jesse Ventura at W&L
many ask? Said CONTACT
Vice—Chair for Finance Dave
Kronenﬁeld; “There were some
on the Committee who thought
he would be a good speaker, and
that thought for the price
[$35,000] he was a large name
for what we are paying for him.
I think he’s going to be an
interesting speaker.”

In the latest stage of his life,
Jesse Ventura seems to have
adopted a look that mirrors his
freedom of political thought.

This “amazing experiment,”
has proved to Ventura that

“people judge based on looks,”
something which some in the
audience did on Tuesday night
before they heard Ventura speak.

Said Jack Zampoln ’09, “His
attire was ridiculous.

“I mean Lee’s buried directly
behind him, he’s wearing a Che
Guevara t-shirt. I swear to God,
Lee must be rolling over in his
grave.”

"Said Jim McDougal ’07, “I
thought he was very charismatic
and he had a lot of interesting
things to say about the way our
government was run.

“He was a little crass...He
called himself an Independent, but
I guess he would be a Libertarian
because he said he was socially
liberal but ﬁscally conservative.”

Despite some bad jokes and
inappropriate insinuations, most
students would agree that Jesse
Ventura’s was something they

were glad they did not miss.

Going the green mile

After a week of hearings, the EC deals out the dough to select student organizations with mixed reactions

This week, many student organizations laid their claim

to EC Budget money. With a new, simpler system of

application and interview, the EC tried their best to be

fair to all clubs. However, as the philosopher Jagger

once said, “You can’t always get what you want.”

Hopefully these organizations got what they needed.

By Sarah Kientz
RE PO RTE R

In 1796, George Washington
saved our school from possible
oblivion with an donation valued
at $20,000.

Now, the gift remains part of
the University’s endowment, ex-
ceeding $500,000. As Washington
showed us, a little faith and gen-
erosity goes a long way. Although
a little less serious than saving the
University, the Executive Com-
mittee allocates money to student
clubs and organizations each fall,
and often their generosity is felt
by some more than others.

The budgeting process, though
reformed in order to make the pro-
cess less time—consuming, ran
smoothly and yielded satisfactory
results for most student organiza-
tions.

Senior Charlie Yates, EC Presi-
dent, said each student organiza-
tion has the same opportunity to
receive the funds they need for the
coming year. Applications are so-
licited a few weeks before EC
Budget hearings, during which
time each organization has an in-
terview in order for the commit-
tee to ask questions. Yates said
there are about 50 organizations
looking to receive some share of
the $400,000 the EC had to allo-
cate.

- Yates stressed that this fall
changes in the allocation process
were made in order to make the
procedure smoother and stressing
the importance of each organiza-
tion knowing the budgeting pro-

cess. Last spring, Yates told orga-
nization leaders that if they went
to a leadership conference to learn
how the budgeting policy works,
they may be favored when it came
time for the fall allocations.

“I really is key that organiza-
tions understand the process. It is
really simple, you just need to take
a few minutes to familiarize your-
self with it,” Yates said.

Senior EC Vice President
Wheeler Sparks said that in order
to improve the allocation process,
the time of each interview was
shortened so that organization
leaders did not spend time repeat-
ing what EC members already
knew.

“We devised a way to combine
interview times so that the groups
that ran over the time limit would
have a chance to borrow from the
groups that ran under,” Sparks
said. “In years past, everyone was
allocated a set time so you could
never gain ground, you could only
give it up. We scheduled to finish
earlier both nights this year, and

for the first time I have ever wit-
nessed we had time to spare.”

In addition to making sure or-
ganizations know the budgeting
process and allotting them time to
make their case, EC members also
have to make the important deci-
sions on which organizations re-
ceive what amount of money.
Yates said each individual EC
member uses his or her own judg-
ment when evaluating each
organization’s proposal.

“Personally, I look at whether
the organization has done a good
job in the past and how wide of
an impact it has on the student
body,” Yates said, “though smaller
organizations that use the money
efficiently are also considered im-
portant.”

Sparks said many factors go
into the decision-making process
for him.

“I like to see an organization
that pays attention to the policies,
doesn’t ask for us to fund things
that we cannot, is succinct but in-
formative in its explanation, and
leaves enough time to answer any
questions we have about the re-
quest or the organization itself,”
Sparks said.

Sparks also stressed that detail
was key in ensuring a club would
receive the amount of funds it was
looking for, although receiving
the exact amount of money re-
quested was rare.

“It seems like most students
carry cell phones these days,”
he added, “so if they see any-
thing that worries them they
shouldn’t hesitate to just dial
up 911.”

Chad Thomas, Senior Jus-
tice of the Inter Fraternity
Council and a member of
Kappa Sigma, reported that
Sgt. Miller of the Lexington
Police spoke to the IFC about
the importance of party safety.

“Sgt. Miller really talked
about the importance of hav-

Police arrest at frat

ing your sober ofﬁcers and se-
curity around,” Thomas said.
“He mentioned that there are
more outsiders near campus
these days.”

The Senior Justice further
said that the fraternities are re-
viewing how they secure their
houses during normal — or non-
party — hours.

Beard said he isn’t sure why
Daniel McCellan showed up in
Davidson Park on that Friday
night. “Maybe he’s a drifter.
All sorts of crazy people can

' come off of the interstate and
into town. It’s just hard to say
‘ why he came here.”

“More detail means less
ambiguity. The more ambiguity a
request has, the easier it is for us
to slash the budget,” Sparks said.
“However, almost no organization
receives exactly what it requests.
The only proposal that did was
modest and accurate, with noble
intentions and a great track
record.”

Sparks could not reveal which
organization received the exact
amount of funds it asked for.

The budget allocation report,
which appeared in Campus No-
tices on Wednesday, revealed that
the EC had allocated $ 402,038.24
to 53 student clubs and organiza-
tions. The three clubs that received
the most funds were the Contact
Committee, receiving $74,000;
the Student Bar Association, get-
ting $90,000; and the Generals
Activity Board (GAB) with
$115,000.

Senior Allan Galis, co-presi-
dent of the GAB, said that he
stressed to the EC that the GAB
has been working to provide
events and entertainment to ac-

commodate a large number of

W&L students, including popular
musical acts.

“Last year we overhauled SAB
by including many activities in the
commons to provide activities for
as many students as possible.

‘We’d like to continue to do this,”

Galis said. “It also became obvi-

ous that, in order to get big name
bands to play at a tiny school in
rural Virginia, the costs were go-
ing to be higher than normal so
the bands could be rerouted from
their typical venues in larger cit-
ies. In short, providing quality
student entertainment is expen-
sive.”

Galis said that receiving the
$115,000 was a walk in the park.

“It wasn’t too stressful for us.
Not too much paper work and a
short, 5 minute presentation,”
Galis said. “Pretty easy.”

For other clubs, receiving the
money they needed was not quite
as easy. Senior Katie Babcock,
president of Habitat for Human-
ity, was disappointed that the EC
allocated only $2000 to the club
that received $7000 in the fall of
2004. Babcock admitted that in
2004 the club needed more money
to pay off the debt they were in
from participating in an expensive
building project.

“Because we are no longer in
debt, I think the EC felt as though
there wasn’t as pressing a need for
habitat to be given so much cash,”
Babcock said.

Babcock added that Habitat
asked for $12,000 this fall, and
was “pretty disappointed that we
only received $2,000, especially
because we need to raise $25,000
this year to build a new home.”
She hopes to make up the loss dur-
ing the winter term allocations
and through fundraising through-
out the fall.

“It was quite a blow to our
chapter, especially since we do so
much fundraising on our own any-
way—much more than most of
the organizations on campus,”

Babcock said. “There is such little
overhead with habitat’s costs, so
it’s sad to see that we can’t use
more money to efﬁciently support
the community.”

Despite the EC’s lack of finan-
cial support for Habitat, Babcock
still has a lot of respect for the
committee. However, she hopes to
see improvements in the alloca-
tion process in the future.

“We are grateful for every dol-
lar [the EC] can give us,” Babcock
said. “However, I wished that we
were given an opportunity to
speak before they asked us ques-
tions. We weren’t able to,convey
the fact that over 75 applications
for homes were completed just
from January-June, and that there
are probably 550-650 eligible
families in our county who would
be interested in receiving a home.
Had we been given an opportu-
nity to present these facts, I think
it would have made more sense
to the EC as to why we wanted so
much money.”

Overall, Yates said that al-
though budget allocations can al-
ways be improved, the most im-
portant thing for the EC is know-
ing the money they allocate wiH
be put to good use.

“Nothing’s ﬂawless, and we’re
always trying to make it better,”
Yates said. “Sometimes groups
come in and request money but
then don’t use it. We want to make
sure we’re giving to people who
will put it to good use.”

With the EC’s help, many carn-
pus clubs and organizations will
be able to provide entertainment,
discussions, and service activities
to accommodate the needs of the
entire student body.

Rugby scores big
in new season

Despite setbacks, team expects success

By Doug Sweeney
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s club
rugby team, the Screaming Minks,
defeated Harnpden-Sydney in
their first game of the year. The
September 17 contest was not
even close as the Minks trounced
the Tigers 78-20. The scoring was
led by juniors Jamie Blake and
Tino Tovo. Both men had 3 scores
apiece.

The Minks hope that this open-
ing victory is a sign of things to
come in the 2005 season. The club
struggled last year going 2-4 and
missing the Ed Lee Invitational
Tournament, Virginia Rugby’s
postseason.

Last year’s campaign ended in
disappointment for the Minks de-
spite the efforts of the class of
2005. It will be tough for the
squad to replace the likes of cap-
tain Rory Dowling, hooker George
Craft and fan favorite Mike
Diverio

The 2005 Minks return a solid
core of players who hope to
eclipse last year’s record. The
squad is captained by seniors Rob-
ert Decosimo, Richard Bruno and
junior Tino Tovo. Decosimo is a
strong on-field leader who plays
the ﬂanker position, he is also the
club’s president. Bruno will step
into the shoes of Craft at the
hooker position and Tovo is a
smart heads-up player from Ar-
gentina. Also returning is the hard
hitting Tucker Lafﬁtte who looks
to dish out more pain in 2005.

Unfortunately the Minks have
had to deal with at least one
offseason injury. Sophomore Ian
Handerhan broke his collarbone
while playing rugby this summer.
Handerhan, a starter last season,
hopes to return in time for the
October 22 contest against
Longwood. The sophomore is tak-
ing his injury like a champ. “I’m
just helping out so I can still be
part of the team,” said Handerhan,
“it’s a slow process, a waiting

game and I’m looking forward to
playing.” ,

There are several new members
to the team who look to have an
impact this year. The hero from the
first game Jamie Blake is a junior
exchange student from St.
Andrews in Scotland. Opposing
squads are already nervous about
this Scot whose talent is only
eclipsed by his knowledge of the
game. Senior David Will is trad-
ing in his high tops for cleats as
he makes the transition from var-
sity basketball to rugby. Will gives
the Minks tremendous size (6’6”,
225) and athleticism.

The club will also receive a
shot in the arm from a strong
freshman class led by Hansen
Babington. These frosh may be
inexperienced but they have re-
markable enthusiasm and energy.

The Minks coaching staff also
made an addition in the offseason.
Helping out head coach Tom
Lovell will be law student Tom
Good. Lovell is a Washington and
Lee alum who graduated in 1991.

While the Minks work hard on
the pitch they work just as hard
off it as evidenced by their annual
fund raiser, the player auction.
This auction involves team mem-
bers putting themselves on sale to
be pledges for a day with proceeds
going to support the club. Even
the team’s name is a reminder of
the work ethic of these men. The
origin of the name, according to
their website, is proof enough:
“Legend has it that W&L rugby
players would wait outside the
VMI barracks for the cadets and
their girls to come back from their
dates. As the ladies were not al-
lowed into the barracks the W&L
rugby players were so kind to es-
con them back home. Thus they
received the name ‘Minks’.”

. The club looks to continue it’s
winning ways this Saturday when
the travel to UNC Greensboro.
The Minks next home game is
Ocotober 8 against the Rams of
VCU.

Rough riders  

Riding team members saddle up for a new competitive season

By Sarah Bloom
STAFF WRITER

Sophomore Alice Shih never
thought she would ride a horse
competitively. Now she competes
as a varsity athlete for Washing-
ton and Lee University’s riding
team.

Shih was just looking for a way
to spend her free time in college.
“I first tried out for the team be-
cause all of my ‘new’ friends at
W&L also tried out,” explained
Shih of her unanticipated decision
to ride. “Once I made the team, I
realized how fun and amazing
riding is.”

“You have to have ‘people of all
ability levels and Alice Shih is a
great example,” said senior Cap-
tain Katie Goodrich of her team-

mate. “Riding is completely dif-
ferent from most varsity sports in
that we actually need people to
walk on the team.”

W&L riders competing at the
collegiate level are broken into
competition levels based on abil-
ity.

The team must provide riders
in the open, intermediate, novice,
walk-trot-cantor, and wa1k—trot
categories. Shih competes at the
most basic level— the walk-trot.

“Open riders have been riding
the longest and require the most
experience,” said Goodrich. “But
when it comes down to it, the be-
ginning riders can Seam the same
amount of points.”

To make the sport even more
complex, riders are never guaran-
teed a given horse. When the team

travels, they depend on the host-
ing team to provide horses. “You
draw a name of a horse out of a
hat right before you compete,”
said Goodrich. “There's no such
thing as warm—up or practice, you
just have to hope you got a good
horse.”

Coach Amy Reistrup helps
them through. I reallly like
Amy...she brings a sense of ease
to the team. Especially in times of
competition, everyone is much
more relaxed.”

Shih attributes the combination
of good coaching and leadership
from captains to the success of the
team. “The captains are great
leaders for me team...constantly
engaging every member of the
team, which is hard to do since we
don’t practice together.”

Let s talk about sex

Students, speakers and the school weigh in on how to eliminate sexual misconduct and improve gender relations

By Kate Shellnutt

STAFF WRITER

What’s going on?

Sex. It’s a good thing, right?
Sarah Jessica Parker and company
show that it’s fun in the city.
Marcy’s Playground lets us know
it’s good with candy. It sells jeans.
And lingerie. And perfume.

But outside of entertain-
ment and advertising, sex can ex-
ist in the real world as something
much darker: abuse, battery, rape,
and violence.

Like other college cam-
puses, Washington and Lee has to
address the occurrence of sexual
violence among its students.

Unlike other college cam-
puses, Washington and Lee has to
deal with these problems occur-
ring at up to double the national
average.

After an American College
Health Association survey re-
vealed these statistics last year, the
university has reacted, not only by
questioning the incidences, but
also by doing all it can to create a
more positive, safe environment
for both men and women at the
school.

Washington and Lee has
taken action, from offering coun-
seling services to forming student

groups to hosting speakers on the

topic.

That’s where Bob Hall, who
held a lecture on nonviolent sexu-
ality in the Commons theater on
Thursday, comes in.

Sponsored by the Gender
Relations Committee (GRC),
LIFE, and One in Four, Hal1’s
message confirms the need for
communication between the gen-
ders.

“What is appropriate?” and
“how do you deﬁne ‘consent?’”
are not just questions that should
be on posters around campus, but
also on the minds of students.

What the speaker had to say

He is educated in “conflict
studies.” He’s been speaking on
the topic for 18 years.

He uses humor and facts in-
stead of judgements to educate on
sexuality.

He opens the lecture by act-
ing out an end-of—the-night scene
on a couch on stage with a mem-
ber of the audience.

. If that’s not enough to make
you listen to his “How not to get
run over by your DRIVE” talk, he
also sounds just like Wallace
Shawn (Vizzini from “The Prin-
cess Bride” and Mr. Hall from
“Clueless”).

With innuendoes, puns, and
a mile-a-minute verbiage, Bob
Hall makes important points about

“Generally speaking, in our society, we seem open enough

to exploit [sex] and make money 0}?’ it, but not enough to deal

with it in real life.”

BOB HALL, on non-violent sexuality

sexual violence, the number one
violent crime on college cam-
puses.

~ Hall encouraged couples to
reduce unwilling sexual touching
or activity by openly discussing
sex instead of “silencing dialog
and hoping for the best” and ar-
gues that the reason people hesi-
tate to discuss the topic are their
differences in sexual education.

At Washington and Lee, stu-
dents come from so many differ-
ent parochial and public schools,
religions, cultures, and regions of
the country.

The diversity of backgrounds
certainly could contribute to the
confusion involving hooking up,
dating, and sexual relations on
campus.

What the school has to say

The University Policy on
Prohibited Student Discrimina-

tion, Harassment, and Sexual
Misconduct begins with this sen-
tence, “Washington and Lee Uni-
versity is a community based on
trust and respect for others,” and
continues to explain how these
actions do not belong in the W&L
community.

Yet, the statistics from last
year’s survey exist: 22.6% of
women having experienced
sexual touching against their will
and 8.5% attempted sexual pen-
etration against their will.

Jan Kaufman, One in Four,
LIFE, and the GRC advisor, plans
on continuing to track these num-
bers.

She hopes to see changes
this year thanks to student action
against sexual misconduct and
school—sponsored programming
like Bob Hall’s lecture.

“His message builds upon
the work of the GRC especially,”

said Kaufman. “Our goal is to
increase interactions between
sexes, and we would like students
to understand healthy dynamics
and relationships.”

The GRC’s slate of activities
also includes Date Night and fur-
ther discussion on the deﬁnition
of consent.

“Students are going to click
on as they begin to hear more and
more,” she continued.

“It is incumbent on all stu-
dents to look out for their friends,
to begin standing up and speak-
ing up against these things.”

What the students have to say

Like Jan Kaufman men-
tioned, the change in the culture
and the reduction of sexual mis-
conduct depends on the action of
W&L students.

Allison Stokan, a junior Peer
Counselor, recognizes the student

population’s struggle, whether
due to intoxication or campus
conventions, to communicate
openly about sex.

“Alcohol and drugs both im- ‘

pair the operation of the mind and
can inﬂuence people to engage in
behavior they wouldn’t nor-
mally,” she said.

“Also, our school is very
conforrnist and this may be shown
in emotionally abusive relation-
ships.”

Students assume the party
scene leads to a “hookup culture,”
where fewer students date.

“‘Hooking up’ at W&L is a
disadvantage for all students be-
cause it can be so awkward,” ad-
mits Courtney Fitzgerald, co-
chair of the GRC.

“The GRC hopes to provide
men and women more opportu-
nities to interact without drinking
as the main form of entertain-
ment.”

A note about statistics.‘

All statistics come from the Na-
tional College Health Assessment
Survey, conducted in March
2004.

Philosophy and feminism

First female philosophy professor at W&L gives up law practice to find happiness in the classroom

By Steph Wiechmann

STAFF WRITER

Melina Bell knows what it’s
like to start over. She knows how
following the wrong path can lead
you to a career you hate with a
miserable schedule. She has
learned what-it takes to pick your-
self up, backtrack to the fork in
the road, and choose again.

Before appearing at Washing-
ton and Lee as the first female pro-
fessor in our philosophy depart-
ment, Bell entered the workforce
as lawyer.

While her heart was in the right
place, Bell found out that she was
happier in the classroom than the
conference room.

Bell’s path forked during her
last year of undergraduate college
in Long Island, NY.

While completing her bach-
elors degree in philosophy at
Hoftstra University, she had to
decide between law school or phi-
losophy graduate school.

It was not an easy decision, as
she could see herself in both pro-
fessions.

“My professors said that I
would never make any money as
a professor of philosophy,” she
said.

Bell then decided that law
school was the way to go. She had
ambitions to practice health law.
She began a program at the Bos-
ton School of Public Health.

At the end of this dual pro-
gram, Bell received both a juris
doctorate to practice law and a
masters degree in public health.

After interning at the Massa-
chusetts Board of Medicine in the
summer, Bell was hired at a large
legal firm in Boston, practicing
large healthcare law.

While she seemed to have it all,
Bell did not find the excitement
or satisfaction she was looking for.

“The hours were just awful,”
she said of her law career.

She would get to the ofﬁce,
ready to work, at 7 a.m. Some-
times she would get to leave at 9
p.m., but on days with large case-
loads, she would not leave the of-
ﬁce until midnight.

“I was happy on Saturdays be-
cause I got to leave at 5 [p.m.],”

she said.

The junior lawyer was also dis-
appointed with the direction her
law practice was taking her.

While practicing large
healthcare law, Bell felt more like
she was practicing business law.

“I thought it was going to be
more service-driven,” she said.

Bored and overworked, Bell
took some thought to critiques
given to her writing style. Col-
leagues would tell her, “don’t phi-
losophize” when she was writing
her briefs.

Bell then made the tough deci-
sion to end her law career and
head back to graduate school in
hopes of becoming a philosophy
professor.

Though apprehensive, Bell de-
cided to pursue her masters degree
in philosophy from Tufts Univer-
sity in Boston.

“I didn’t want to embark on an-
other career that would lead me
nowhere,” she said of her deci-
sion.

Nonetheless, Bell graduated
and headed to the University of

 

“My professors said that I would never

make any money as a professor of

philosophy . . . But I ’ve found that it’s

just not that important compared to the

quality of life.”

M E L l NA B E L L, A ' Professor of Psychology

Pennsylvania to obtain a Ph. D.
in Philosophy — a degree she com-
pleted in May of 2005.

With all of her qualiﬁcations
in order, she set out to ﬁnd a job
that she hoped would give her the
satisfaction she had never found.

Using the publication “Jobs for
Philosophers,” she stumbled
across a posting by Washington
and Lee for a feminist political
philosophy professor.

Bell’s ideal choice would be a
small, liberal arts school, so she
applied for the job.

When she was hired, she was
excited by W&L’s emphasis on
teaching.

“I don’t like the research em-
phasis as much,” she said when
choosing which postings to apply
for. “I wanted to be primarily a
teacher.”

She found working as a pro-
fessor and with students pleased
her in a way that her law practice
did not.

“Adults can be cynical and
jaded be cause of the experiences
they’ve had,” Bell said. “People

here are cheerful, optimistic, ide-
alistic, and have a sense of hu-
mor.”

As well as she gets along with
the students, Bell also enjoys
workin g with the other professors
in the philosophy department,
where she is the only woman.

Bell said that her gender is not
an issue within the department.

“My colleagues have attitudes
enlightened by sex equality,” said
the philosophy professor. “There

What a difference

a dorm makes

Students banter about pros and cons of freshmen residence halls

By Rebecca Koval
and Casidhe Horan
STAFF WRITER

Are all dorms created
equal? Students in
Graham-Lees tend to be
lively and loud, while
students in the BGD quad
are more mellow. There
is a constant party on one
side of Washington Street,
and constant studying on
the other. Myth or reality?
Admissions plot or

coincidental?

Fire alarms at two o’clock in
the morning, anatomically ex-
aggerated body parts strewn
across walls and white boards,
blaring music at all hours of the
night- these are just some of the
myriad joys made possible by
life in the freshmen dorms.

Ask any student, past or
present, and he or she will tell
you: all residence halls are not
created equal.

Oh, yes, we are all provided
with the same modern conve-
niences, (i.e. indoor plumbing
and the like) but, obviously,
something very strange happens
when one crosses Washington
Street.

The atmosphere of the quad
versus Graham-Lees is intrinsi-
cally different in terms of the
activity levels.

It is not the appearance of in-
room sinks. The disparity, then,
clearly lies in the “individua1i—
ties” of Baker/Davis/Gilliam
and Graham-Lees and the stu-
dents who live in them.

Now, perhaps it is all the

Rumor had it that Kate Hudson was coming to town with her husband

Salernos. They

Drew Davenport, ’06:

All the people who crash in the quad are actually traveling

over to Graham-Lees and living it up in the labyrinth . . .

Any idiot will tell you it is a ridiculous wish to expect to ﬁnd

solace in Graham-Lees and it is equally moronic to hope for

a spontaneous gathering of any substance in the quad.

 

endless corridors and dispropor-
tionate ﬂights of stairs that make
the ladies and gentlemen of Gra-
ham-Lees feel the need to turn
their homey environment into an
all—night dance party.

There is, after all, just some-
thing about getting lost on your
own ﬂoor to prompt a raucous
bacchanal.

The other side of the street
does not seem to have the same
problem.

I could be wrong, but I know
when I wander off to Gilliam to
study Calculus, those BDG
snobs must not be drinking the
same water. ‘

It is like stepping into another
dimension. Not only do I con-
serve breath from climbing
fewer stairs, I also avoid the n1is—
haps of aimless bumbling into
foreign halls.

Not only this, but the college
din seems to be calmed over
yonder.

However, this could be attrib-
uted to the fact that all the people
who crash in the quad are actu-
ally traveling over to Graham-
Lees and living it up in the laby-
rinth. »

How could such a difference
exist just mere yards away?

‘ Well, it is not because the
Residential Life ofﬁce is out to
isolate the serious students from
the hooligans.

Dean of Freshman Dave

Leonard said that his office
makes every attempt to match
incoming students with prefer-
ences based on roommate com-
patibility and questions an-
swered on the housing request
forms mailed during the summer.

If a student specifically re-
quests a sink in his or her room,
he or she will be living in Baker,
Gilliam, or Davis, depending
upon room availability.

If the student has requested
substance- free accommoda-
tions, he or she will be placed in
a hall that does not condone the
more festive distractions.

Despite Residential Life’s
best efforts, however, it is hard
to guarantee consistent quiet
hours when nearby floors and
visitors from you—kn0w-where
invade one’s halls in the valiant
attempt to add color and volume
to our otherwise mundane exist-
ences.

Essentially, it all comes down
to living wisely. Any idiot will
tell you it is a ridiculous wish to
expect to find solace in Graham-
Lees, and it is equally moronic
to hope for a spontaneous gath-
ering of any substance in the
quad.

There are, of course, benefits
to both environments. Freshman

   
  
   

Michelle Snyder said that the
BDG quad has “a lot less
people, so it’s a closer knit com-
munity.”

On the other end of the spec-
trum, Jen Sanow said, “Living
in Graham-Lees is great. You
have a lot more opportunities
to meet other freshmen and are
definitely much more in the
center of things.”

The three dorms in the quad
almost make up one third of the
square feet in Graham-Lees.
And our respective environ-
ments do foster a healthy sense
of residential loyalty.

If nothing else, we each have
acquired certain skills neces-
sary for life in the real world.

Freshman Ellie Hanson said,
“[Graham-Lees] really helps
your geography and tracking
skills... I feel better prepared
to be lost in the woods some-
day after the first three weeks
of looking for my dorm room.”

When all is said and done,
both dorms have their advan-
tages. No matter which side of
the street one lives on, loyalty
to one’s home dorm lasts for-

Winning the ﬁreshman vote

Lack of turnout for student speeches and voting represents worrisome school-wide apathy

By Justin McKeen
STAFF COLUMNIST

Given the recent reluctance of
young people to turn up to the
polls in national elections, I guess
it’s probably too much to expect
something as mundane as fresh-
man class elections to elicit much
of a response.

It still seems sad though when I

only a little more than half of the
class votes, and even sadder when
only twenty people show up to
hear the candidates speeches.

In recent days, quite a few of
my friends have told me that they
would have attended the speeches
had they known about them. They
were announced in the campus
notices but, honestly, does anyone
really read those?

Some of the blame then, it
seems fair to say, lies with the in-
effective way in which the event
was advertised.

Furthermore, if you didn’t
make it, you really didn’t miss
much. Ifyou’ve ever heard a high-
school student council speech, you
can pretty faithfully recreate what
was said on Sunday.

The lack of attendance at the
speeches does raise one question
though: if only twenty people
knew the candidates’ platforms
(such as they were), what were the
other 200 or so basing their votes
on?

Yes, Jeremy Wainwright does
have an afro. Yes, he does own a
burgundy-colored suit and a sweet
cowboy hat. But what do any of
these things have to do with stu-

If only twenty people knew the candidates’

platforms (such as they were), what were the

other 200 or so basing their votes on?
 

dent government?

I’m not attacking Jeremy
here—I know him, he’s a nice guy.
I have every conﬁdence that he’ll
be a good President.

But how, at a school named
after George Washington, and
claiming to be one of the best in-
stitutions of higher learning in the
country, do we vote for people
based on (someone actually told
me this) their Beirut skills?

Maybe I’m making too big a
deal out of this. After all, it’s only

a freshman class election.
Everyone’s busy, tl1ere’s partying,
school, usually more partying.
The problem I had is that if
you can’t be bothered to vote (or
vote intelligently) when you
know the candidates personally,
how easy does it become to not
vote in local elections? State elec-
tions? Dare we even say national
ones?
I’m not sure I believe the ru-
mor going around that the fresh-
man class has more liberals than

conservatives, but whatever your
political orientation, voting is one
of your duties as a citizen. People
have suffered and died to estab-
lish and protect our system of gov-
emment.

If you didn’t vote this past
week, or if you’re an upperc1ass-
man (from what I’ve heard, your
elections aren’t exactly blockbust-
ers either), but you get out there
and vote when it means some—
thing, great. You just read this ar-
ticle for nothing.

But for those of you who sit
around and tell me how George
Bush is ruining the world (or sav-
ing it——I’ve heard both), but then
won’t go out and vote, well, you
deserve whatever you get. Let’s
just hope it doesn’t doom the rest
of us along with you.

Not—so—beautifu1 minds

Lack of student discussion on important events shows W&L intellectual culture ends outside of class

On campus, relevant political matters and current

events often take the back seat to the day’s hottest

exploration into an issue of wide-
spread importance. The discus-
sion was pointedly intellectual,
showcasing from a multi—disci—
plinary perspective how and why
the Court operates as it does. At
the same time, the conversation
was engaging and accessible,
even for those without extensive
knowledge of America’s judicial
system.

Unfortunately, these types of
intelligent discussions — on politi-
cal matters, on current events, and
on other consequential topics -
occur far too infrequently on
W&L’s campus. In fact, they are
almost nonexistent.

Although W&L is an excellent
academic school, it sometimes
falls short of being an excellent
intellectual school. This concept
is especially true regarding the
student body’s treatment of politi-
cal issues. For some reason, po-
litically minded students — or, to
quote one of George F. Will’s re-
cent columns in The Washington
Post, “those political snail darters,

the emblematic endangered spe-
cies” — have largely surrendered
their presence on W&L’s campus.

This conclusion is conﬁrmed
to me time and again when a sig-
niﬁcant topic, not necessarily po-
litical in nature, is raised for dis-
cussion in class. Usually profes-
sors ‘are able to generate some in-
sightful, if not revelatory, conver-
sation among students. But when
the bell rings signaling the end of
class, something surprising and, in
my judgment, troubling happens:
The debate promptly ends, as if it
were all nothing more than an
obligatory duty fulﬁlled.

In some respects, this behav-
ior should be expected. After all,
college students have other things
to worry about than Roberts’ po-
sition on eminent domain or
whether he thinks Marbury v.
Madison was correctly decided. It
is not my contention that students
should spend all of their time read-
ing The Economist, listening to
NPR, or watching C-SPAN.
Rather, my point is this: It would
not hurt us, at least sometimes, to
talk about topics other than what
we are doing on Saturday night. It

would not hurt us, at least some— .

times, to be a little more politically
minded.

In calling for students to be
politically minded, I am not sug-
gesting that students should begin
protesting, staging sit-ins, and tak-

ing to the streets of Lexington.
Rather, I am encouraging students
to attempt to become more aware
of the salient political issues sur-
rounding their lives. From there,
students can begin to formulate or
sharpen their opinions and express

I am not suggesting
that students should be-
gin protesting, staging
sit-ins, and taking to
the streets of Lexington.
 

them in a thoughtful manner.

Let me afﬁrm that I am not in
favor of changing the political
culture on campus simply for the
sake of changing the political cul-
ture. Students should not alter
their habits merely to advance
some vague notion of political
ediﬁcation. Otherwise, such en-
gagement would become rote and
tired, much like some academics
in the classroom, which are sim-
ply done for the sake of doing it
as it has always been done.

Instead, students should be-
come involved in politics for more
tangible reasons: to learn the val-
ues of civic virtue and community
participation; to understand how

individuals, groups, and institu-
tions interact to form society; and,
above all, to expose them to issues
and ideas world beyond the nar-
row conﬁnes of Lexington.

How can this best be achieved?

First, students should consider
taking classes that deal specifi-
cally with political issues. Intro-
ductory courses like American
National Government, Political
Philosophy, and Comparative
Government are good places to
start. But students can also chal-
lenge themselves through a wealth
of interdisciplinary classes, nota-
bly those afﬁliated with the Shep-
herd Poverty Program.

Second, there exist several for-
mal outlets for students to effi-
ciently disseminate their views on
a range of topics. Perhaps one of
the best methods is to do exactly
what I am doing right now — writ-
ing in the school newspaper. By
publishing op-eds, students alert
others to various ideas and per-
spectives. Simultaneously, they
provide an impetus for healthy
debate among the student body.

Actually, in posing this ques-
tion, I am just complicating what
is really very simple: The best way
to make a difference on campus
is to be political and have fun.
Students have more power to
change the political culture at
W&L than they could ever real-
ize. It just takes a little effort.

Can New Orleans rise again‘?

Nation’s time and reconstruction money better spent moving all disaster prone cities to more secure locations

By Dane Boston
COLUMNIST

My father has been trying to
convince me that to rebuild New
Orleans again in its current loca-
tion would be foolish, and a waste
of taxpayers’ dollars.

Why spend $250 billion when
another hurricane like Katrina
could quite literally sweep that in-
vestment out to sea?

The trend appears to indicate
that we will see such a storm.

I did my best to hold up the cul-
ture of New Orleans, the city’s sig-
nificant place in

American history, and the ex-
ceptional opportunity of salvaging
the Big Easy’s treasures while si-
multaneously correcting its prob-
lems.

I pleaded, “What ' about
beignets, and jazz, and the French
Quarter?”

“ What about Mardi Gras?!”

But in the end, sentimentalism
could not stand against dollars and
cents sense.

At first I felt bad about relent-
ing to my dad’s econon1ically-fo-
cused assault.

But my faculties of reason
could not mount a sufficient re-
buttal.

Indeed, my faculties of reason
betrayed my original position a
short while into .the argument.

What sense does it make to
build a city below sea level?

Levees are bound to break.

No feat of engineering genius
could make them stand forever.

Another hurricane could leave
the city of New Orleans in an even
worse position.

The only logical solution:
move it.

Reason, once released from the
stiﬂing conﬁnes of base emotion,
has an inclination (as strong as

The only reasonable solution to the problem

of whether or not to rebuild New Orleans is

simple: we must move all of our national

treasures to the relative safety of the moon.

water ﬂowing into a low lying
area) to set all mistakes of judg-
ment right.

Thus did my reason proceed

. uninhibited, after vanquishing the

petty problem of New Orleans.
As a Floridian, I know first-

hand the dangerous and unpre-

dictable nature of hurricanes.

It is quite impossible to tell
where they are going and how
strong they will be when they ar-
rive.

They carry in their swirling
winds an enormous potential for
damage.

And practically no location on
the Gulf or Atlantic coasts is safe.

How can we avoid the tremen-
dous costs that a major hurricane
could incur making landfall near
an important city?

The only reasonable course we
have: move our cities.

Too many lie along the dis-
tressingly exposed eastern sea-

board, and should summarily
move inland.

My home state must be emp-
tied in her sunny entirety.

The cost may be tremendous,
but compared to the cost of clean-
ing up after a vicious storm (which
would include a cost in human
life, fortuitously avoided in pre-
emption), it is a pittance.

But can we reasonably stop at
the possibility of hurricanes along
the east coast?

Much of the Midwest, the
“Heartland,” is vulnerable to
ﬂooding from the Mississippi
River, or disastrous tornadoes.

In addition, I understand the
“Dust Bowl” was unpleasant.

The Paciﬁc coast, mercifully
free of hurricanes, is unfortunately
prone to cataclysmic earthquakes.

And, regretfully, we now
know that no part of the country
is beyond a doubt safe from the
reach of terrorists.

All of these threats demand to
be addressed.

The American taxpayers must
be spared the anguish of funding
innumerable reconstruction
projects around the country.

Conveniently, a plausible an-
swer was found in this very paper
a short time ago...

The only reasonable solution to
the problem of whether or not to
rebuild New Orleans is simple: we
must move all of our national trea-
sures to the relative safety of the
moon.

It’s the only reasonable, eco-
nomical course of action.

My father is absolutely correct.
Rebuilding New Orleans would be
an act of sentimental foolishness.

Why waste money on some-
thing as silly as musty history and
gaudy culture?

Review your strategies for getting some action: are they helping or hindering your chance for a hook up?

By Hugh Trout
STAFF COLUMNIST

Before people get angry, al-
low me to remind you that these
are just the grievances and ob-
servations of just one man, no
matter how sexy he may so hap-
pen to be. If you disagree, that’s
fine (you probably eat mayon-
naise and are an Eagles fan any-
way).

While each of us here at W&L
have our own moves, lines,
looks, games, tactics and pre-
ferred levels of intoxication,
there are a few standards when
it comes to getting some action
in Lexington.

Some are good, such as
complimenting your desired
hook up on knowing so much of
the Call on Me dance, others are
not, such as talking about how
fratty it was of you that you
booted and rallied within the last
twenty minutes.

Some strategies remain

Confessions of a ‘Desperate’ mind

Some strategies remain prevalent despite being

crass and poorly implemented. These should

go the way of the XFL and parachute pants . . .

I know all of you who just read the last sentence

must be asking: have I done any of these?
 

prevalent despite being crass and .

poorly implemented. These
should go the way of the XFL
and parachute pants.

And now my dear reader, the
introspective question that I
know all of you who just read the
last sentence must be asking:
have I done any of these?

The answer: almost certainly,
lord knows I have. But if former
head of FEMA Michael Brown
has taught us any lesson it is this:
don’t blame yourself, blame oth-
ers.

Lets begin with the most com-
mon offense: being way more
drunk than the person you are

trying to hook up with.

Man, this one is a classic.
Here is a good way to rational-
ize this one: maybe if the other
person was a little less into
breaking a move to “toxic” you
could have been talking rather
than planning your next super
sweet move with your friends
while downing another fratty
light.

It’s a trap that has caught all
men at one time or another, and
I have certainly seen our females
generals partake in this time hon-
ored tradition.

The saving grace about this
screw up is that while you’re

level intoxication made everyone
else feel very uncomfortable so-
cially, you probably won’t end up
remembering it in the morning.

The next hook up move
that needs to be destroyed is
closely related to the first: the
drunken booty call.

Don’t get me wrong, the so-
ber phone call to try and get some
is amazing and can work won-
ders if it is played well, but the
drunken booty call is as likely to
go well as that time your friends
convinced you that they prom-
ised they would not take your

clothes when you streaked the

house.

Physical desperation can be
masked in a phone call, but it
takes one hundred percent of
your mind.

If you even have had just a
couple drinks, the person will
probably pick up on it and will
always look down on you for it.
There simply is no recovery from
that one.

The next one is short
and very much an increasing
problem: anything to do with
hooking up and facebook is hor-
rible.

You owe yourself and the
other person much more, no mat-
ter how hard you try to rational-
ize your stalking habits.

Case in point: if you didn’t get
their cell number from them, you
are not allowed to call their cell,
no matter how many different
ways you are able to obtain the
number.

There is a hook up tac-
tic and strategy that I certainly
think deserves to get way more
credit than it does.

This special method consists
of using classes to get to know
that special other person.

Then set up a very, very pro-
ductive study group in which you
are able to honestly sell the line
“I study better when it’s one on
one”.

There is nothing like ﬁghting

back against the evil academia

system by using what is forced
upon you to get some action to
come your way.

Well, that’s all I have to say
on the matter, and I hope that no
one is beating themselves up
over committing any of these
hook up blunders because in the
end, it’s all about the participa-
tion award.

The man or woman who fails
isn’t the one who gets blasted,
makes an ass of themselves and
ends up puking outdoors while
the party looks away in disgust.

No, the true failure is the man
or woman who didn’t have to
courage to go up to that special
someone and tell them that they
must have space pants on cuz dat
ass is out of this world.

Nothing beats curling up on the couch with beer and the boys to watch four middle-aged women in aprons

By Marshall Rule
STAFF COLUMNIST

After a few months of hiding,
I am back on the back page. I
would like to apologize ahead of
time to my favorite fan who shall
remain nameless (cough-
AnnieV’sMom-cough), butl will
not be writing every week. . .just
occasionally when I feel in-
spired.

And right now, I am very in-
spired by Sunday nights.

To most people the week is
just buildup to the weekend.
Everyone “Thanks God it’s Fri-
day.” I am not most people.

My week hits a high point
every Sunday night. While ev-

eryone else in school seems to
be in the Library catching up on
the work they did not do over the
weekend, I am in the basement
with a six pack by my side.

It’s something that many men
have trouble admitting. On the
list of things that men will never
confess to, the fact that they en-
joy watching Desperate House-
wives falls somewhere in be-
tween Erectile Dysfunction and
liking fat girls.

However I am one of the few
men who are proud to say that I
love Desperate Housewives.
Every week about ﬁve of us guys
get together to watch the show
that we love (as a side note: we
watch it with our lights on and

I am one of the few men who are proud to say that I

us guys get together to watch the show that we love.

with a girl or two. .. unlike a few
certain guys I know who watch
the OC four to a bed. .. you know
who you are).

I also do not simply watch the
show because Eva Langoria is
hot, but I will say that was a part
of it in the beginning. The show
is about so much more than 4
middle aged sex goddesses,
which is not to say that I
wouldn’t kill for a chance to be

with any one of them.

I have taken online Desper-
ate Housewives quizzes, such as
which Housewife I would most
likely date in the real world (Su-
san. .. 77 percent certainty). I am
getting the first season on DVD
for Christmas (I know this, be-
cause I am planning on buying it
for myself and wrapping it).

What does Desperate House-
wives have that the OC doesn’t

you ask? How about a person
tied up in the basement of the
new neighbors’ house. How
about actors who are the age of
the character that they play.

How about a plot that isn’t
completely predictable. I have
only seen two episodes of the OC
(my girlfriend makes me watch
it... I swear), and even I knew
that the Dean was hooking up
with the one girl who wants to
be social chair.

But I guarantee that nobody
saw that Carlos’ mom was going
to fall down the stairs just 1r1in—
utes after waking up from her
coma.

I realize that I should have to
turn in my “Y Card” for know-

ing the amount of useless infor-
mation I do about the show (for
those of you who don’t know
what the Y card is. .. it’s the card
proving that I have a Y Chromo-
some). But, to be honest, I don’t
care.

I am not afraid to say that I
look at imdb.com at least twice
a week to see if someone has
made any updates to the memo-
rable quotes section. I am not
afraid to say that I surf the web
trying to find out if anyone
knows what’s going to happen in
next week’s episode.

I am coming out of the Des-
perate Housewives closet to you.
Here I am. Accept me for who I
am.

Mayock, Contact go three rounds in debate over speakers, student funds and political agenda

By Marshall Rule

Contact Committee’s Vice-
Chair for Finance, David
Kronenfeld, is frustrated with the
Celebrating Women Cormnittee.

According to Kronenfeld, Con-
tact was asked to provide a
speaker for the Celebrating
Women keynote speaker.

But Kronenfeld’s frustration
comes from the mandates that
were requested by Dean Mayock,
Chair of Planning for the Celebrat-
ing Women Committee.

Kronenfeld was asked to
choose a keynote speaker who is

politically liberal.

“Dean Mayock said that the
speaker must come from the left,
and that anything else would be a
Republican woman’s mouth
speaking men’s ideas.

“I was so surprised to hear
something like that from her, he
said.”

In a personal interview this

According to Mayock, Laura
Bush is a person who is famous
through her husband, compared to
Hillary Clinton, who has raised
important issues regarding welfare
as a Senator since being First
Lady.

Kronenfeld agrees with
Mayock that no woman should be
brought in who hasn’t accom-
plished things on her own. But
Kronenfeld would like to be able
to choose the speaker based on
merit, rather than political afﬁ1ia-
tion. '

He would have liked to get
Peggy Noonan, but Kronenfeld
says Mayock did not respond well

to the idea.

Kronenfeld said, “I am more
than happy to provide a speaker
for the Celebrating Women Com-
mittee.

“I just don’t think that we
should be asked to provide a
speaker whose views don’t reﬂect
the student body’s.”

Ultimately the choice was up
to Contact Committee, who has
decided to bring in Barbara
Ehrenreich to speak.

Ehrenreich is a political essay-
ist and social critic who is in-
volved in a broad range of social
issues. Her recent book, Nickle
and Dimed, described her attempt

to live on low—wage jobs sold over
a million copies.

Both Mayock and Kronenfeld
are satisfied with the choice of
speaker.

Kronenfeld is just not happy
with the administration pressuring
Contact to use student funds in a
certain way.

“There are two major issues
here,” Kronenfeld said.

“The first is the
administration’s desire to use stu-
dentfunds. The second is that we
were given a political mandate by
the administration to pick a
speaker of a certain political per-
suasion.”

Minority report

Admissions seeks new ingredients for the salad bowl

By Sarah Kientz
REPORTER

While the admissions depart-
ment looks at all aspects of an pro-
spective student’s application, mi-
nority status is often a large fac-
tor.

Though many believe that mi-
nority students are favored in the
admissions process, the admis-
sions department is only striving
to expose minority students to
W&L in order to diversify our
campus, Admissions Counselor
Charlie Boisky said.

Boisky said the admissions de-
partment looks for “high-achiev-
ing students” with good statistics
such as a class rank in the top 10%
of their classes, outstanding SAT
and ACT scores, but also students
who are “big ﬁsh in a small pond-
type kids.”

“We like to see students with
lots of leadership experience who
are very passionate about some-
thing, whatever it is, that will con-
tribute to the W&L environment,”
Boisky said.

He added that ethnic diversity
is also important in contributing
to the “W&L environment.” _

“In class it’s not so much the
person standing in front of you,
it’s the person next to you that you
learn from,” Boisky said. He
added that when he was a student
at W&L, his classmates believed
W&L students were “living in a
bubble.”

“We want the student body to
be more reflective of the world
outside this campus,” Boisky said.

So are minority students fa-
vored in the admissions process?
Boisky made it seem like the an-
swer was yes and no.

Boisky said the admissions de-
partment gives minority students
many incentives to visit the carn-
pus and to apply.

For example, the admissions
department offers overnight cam-
pus visits for any ethnic minority,
in which they will pay for the
student’s airfare or other means of
travel if necessary.

In addition, the Heinz Schol-
arship is a large draw for minority
students, Erin Hutchinson, Assis-
tant Director of Admissions and
Coordinator of Minority" Recruit-
ment, said.

The scholarship, established by
the H.J. Heinz Company Founda-
tion, provides for all academic and
living expenses for four years.

Scholarship winners are given
paid internships with the H].

  

Heinz company each summer,
with a strong possibility of em-
ployment with Heinz once stu-
dents have graduated from W&L.

Three to five Heinz scholar-
ships are awarded each year.

Hutchinson said that Heinz and
W&L work together through the
scholarship in order to increase
diversity both in the company and
on campus.

“The scholarship is aimed at
students with disadvantaged back-
grounds, which is typically minor-
ity students,” Hutchinson said.

Through campus visits and the
Heinz scholarship, Hutchinson
said the admissions department is
attempting to draw minority stu-
dents to consider W&L.

“A lot of minority students, for

example, Arrrcan American stu-
dents, rnight be turned off by a
school named after Robert E.
Lee,” Hutchinson said. “Most stu-
dents who come to visit fall in love
with the place, but we need to ex-
pose them first and make them see
that we are not still ﬁghting the
civil war.”

Although minority students
may receive some advantages
while visiting campus, everyone
is on equal ground when it comes
to applying to W&L.

Each application is looked at
individually, and no students are
accepted based on ethnicity,
Boisky said, adding that“minority
students are every bit as qualified
as everyone else.”

Hutchinson said that minority
status often comes into play when
the department is “separating
equals,” or making decisions be-
tween two students who are
equally as qualiﬁed.

“We want a well—rounded class
with people from different areas,
backgrounds, and experiences,”
Hutchinson said.

“Anybody that has something
that we’re lacking has an advan-
tage,” she said, adding that this
“something” could be anything
from ethnicity and socio-eco-
nomic status to a unique passion
or activity.

Hutchinson said the freshman
class has 49 students of American
Ethnic/Racial Minorities, making
up 10% of the class: 20 African-
American, 1 Native American, 16
Asian American, 6 Hispanic and
6 Multicultural or other ethnic
group.

Overall, Hutchinson added that
the most important aspect in the
admissions department is to select
students they feel will be comfort-
able and contribute to W&L.

“We’re not trying to bring any-
body here who’s not going to suc-
ceed or enjoy their time,”
Hutchinson said. “Over-night vis-
its are to expose students to the
campus, not to force people here.”

Freshman Shreya Durvasula, a
student of Indian decent, found
out about W&L through her high
school college counselor and was
not given any beneﬁts while vis-
iting campus.

Although she does not see
W&L as a diverse campus, she
saw life here as a unique opportu-
nity.

“I wasn’t going to go here be-
cause there was such a lack of di-
versity, but I saw it as a chance to
teach others about my culture,”
Durvasula said. “It was an oppor-
tunity for me to take a chance and
be tolerant, too.”

David Leonard, the Dean of
Freshmen, said it is important to
focus on diversity in order to pre-
pare for life after college.

“Increased ethnic diversity in
the United States is an important
reality that governments, commu-
nities, organizations, companies
and college campuses are facing,”

‘Leonard said.

“I strongly believe that a
diverse student body, faculty and
staff at W&L will greatly enhance
teaching and learning both in and
beyond the classroom and prepare
our students for life beyond Wash-
ington and Lee.”

BEHIND
BARS

Here’s to laughing at the expense of
those who learned their lessons this
weekend. Reporter Jacob Geiger took
a peek at this week’s police reports to
see what you ’ve been up to...don’t

worry, we only used your initials!

Minors offending

DC, a junior resident of one
of Tucker Street’s favorite
houses, was ticketed last
Monday at 1:40 AM for un-
derage possession of alcohol.
Three 19-year-olds from
Oklahoma, none of whom at-
tend W&L, were ticketed at
the same time. No word on
whether these fine chaps
were some of the Sigma Nu
pledges visiting from Okla-
homa State. Wherever
they’re from, the three left
Lexington with a souvenir of
their visit.

What LIFE posters are
made of

EB and AB, two fun-loving
freshmen from the BDG
Quad, found out that Nelson
St. can be quite perilous at
4:23 AM. Though EB
doesn’t remember what hap-
pened and AB says “if you
don’t remember what ‘hap-
pened I’m not going to tell
you,” the police apparently
do know what happened.
Stumble around drunk at
4:15 and you’re liable to
“wake up in a room with no
windows and a locked door,”
as EB so eloquently put it.
Punishment (after making a
deal with the prosecutor): 7
months probation. Ifthe -
probation is broken, a $2500
fine and up to a year in jail
could result.

Safety becomes

the numbers.

“Part of the reason the ’04
numbers were up is that we had a
string of burglaries and larcenies
in the downtown business district
last summer, and that drove things
up.

“We made an arrest eventually
and broke up the ring,” he said.

When asked about the recent
run of crimes around W&L, Beard
responded that he “hopes these
recent events are just an isolated
spike in crime. Hopefully it’s not
a sign of a long term trend.

“We’d like to get some leads
in those fraternity crimes [thefts
from the Phi Psi Fraternity House,
7 Tucker, a PIKA off-campus
house, and other residences over
Homecoming Weekend], but
larceny and vandalism are two of
the hardest crimes to solve unless
we can catch someone in the act
or find a witness who is 100% sure
they know who did it.”

Hot Springs
540.839.2050
thejefferson@tds.net

Michael Young, W&L’s
Director of Campus Security,
agreed with Chief Beard’s
analysis. <

“I’m absolutely convinced,” he
reported, “that these aren’t
evidence of some larger trend.

“In fact, I think the pictures that
were taken from the frat houses
were probably stolen by a frat
that’s not here at W&L. Really,
when you think about it, fraternity
composites, paintings of Lee, and
pictures of the Colonnade would
be trophies for a frat at some other
school.”

Perhaps most disturbing of all
is the still anonymous man who
has, on at least four instances,
followed a female student out of
the library and back to either the
residence halls or sorority houses.

On at least two occasions the
man asked the woman out on a
date, even though neither woman
had met him before.

None of the women involved

6118 Sam Snead ‘Highway

wanted to speak on the record to
the Phi, but several of the girls
have told their friends about
seeing the man around campus.

While Young reported that the
security office had been contacted
about the stalker, he expressed
frustration with the students’
failure to promptly inform his staff
about the problem.

While W&L students are all
busy thinking about their own
safety, local residents must also
consider crimes committed by
these students.

The FBI’s 2003 report
documented 72 cases of drunk
driving and another 74 cases of
public drunkenness.

Toss in the 28 liquor law
violations and 25 drug crimes and
you discover that 60% of the 330
tickets issued by the Lexington
Police Department were related to
either drugs or alcohol.

Though the Phi was unable to
determine exactly how many of

Unclean getaway

Too tired to clean up the de-
bris from your latest party be-
fore passing out? You may
want to reconsider that deci-
sion. Lex Po cracked down
this month on littering, issu-
ing tickets to CW and CQ in
separate incidents. Both tick-
ets were issued on a Sunday
morning for “litter on prop-
erty.” CW’s ticket was issued
at the un-holy hour of 8:43
AM, long before most rea-
sonable students would even
consider climbing out of bed
to pick up plastic cups. Be-
sides, isn’t that what pledges
are for?

Laws of physics

This week’s list includes a
W&L male who was pulled
over while sober driving.
The police clocked him at 40
mph in a 25 zone. When
asked in court why he was
driving so fast, the driver re-
plied, “Well, I didn’t even
have my foot on the accelera-
tor, I think. I guess the car’s
momentum was just too
strong and I let it get away
from me. I was just trying to
do what was right and get ev-
eryone back.” Though the
judge didn’t seem to buy the
whole “momentum theory,”
the driver got off with just 10
hours of community service
and a driver improvement
course.

issue

these crimes were committed by
W&L students, a cursory glance
at the police station’s docking
book indicates that W&L students
are responsible for a signiﬁcant
portion of all arrests and an even
larger proportion of arrests for
public drunkenness.

The 238 crimes mentioned
earlier reﬂect the number of actual
guilty convictions, not number of
tickets issued.

“We’ve had one call about it,
he said, “and even then the person
waited until a week after the
incident before calling us.

“So if this has happened more
than once, nobody’s called us to
tell us about it.

“If somebody sees that guy
they need to report him as soon as
possible; by acting quickly we can
try to get the guy before he leaves
campus.

“We can’t do much without a
timely call from the student who’s
being followed.”

Stepping it up an octave

After years of mediocrity, campus choral groups stage acomeback

By Jessica Shaw
STAFF WRITER

It was difficult to ﬁnd a seat
on the balcony of the Lexington
Presbyterian Church last week as
students, professors and commu-
nity members packed in to listen
to the music performed by W&L
choral groups. These talented vo-
calists took the stage for over an
hour captivating" their audience
with a wide variety of music.

The University Chamber Sing-
ers started the night off with four
beautiful pieces ranging from Ubi
Caritas et Amor to a tango selec-

tion.

They plan to perform similar
tango pieces when they travel to
Argentina over spring break.

“I feel like we needed just a
little more time to tweak some
things, and our Parents’ Weekend
concert will be a lot better,”
sophomore alto Emma Axt said.

“We had a lot of songs and not
very much time to learn them.
Now that we have performed, we
can identify the rough spots and
work on them.”

This prestigious group is led by
Professor Gordon Spice who has
directed choral activities since
1973.

He’s very open-minded if we
have any suggestions about any of

the pieces,” Axt said. “He’s very
good at what he does; he can be
low key and still take it seriously
and be a very good leader.”

General Admission, JubiLee,
and Southern Comfort Singers
then stunned spectators with con-
temporary selections like Break-
fast at Tiffany’s clad in bright col-
ors and decorative accessories.

Solos were performed by fresh-
man Wes Haydon and juniors Sam
Wilmoth and Taylor Walle .

The 65-member University
Chorus then charmed the crowd
with their ‘Season of the Classics’
theme incorporating Hadyn,
Mozart and Brahms. Chorus Di-
rector Jerry Myers is in his seventh

year at W&L. With his arrival, he
has shaped the choir from a stu-
dent activity into a prestigious vo-
cal unit.

“In my ﬁrst couple of years, it
was hard not being able to do
music beyond a high school
level,” Myers said. “Now with au-
ditions, we started to build the
choir back up. Then, we were able
to do more challenging music.
More challenging music is Very
rewarding.”

The chorus meets on Mondays
and Wednesdays from 4:30-6pm.
They perform four concerts each
year, this one being their first. For
the fall concert, the chorus gath-
ered for a mere 10 rehearsals. Pro-

fessor Myers said the first re-
hearsal is always the most fun for
him. i
“I don’t know the group; that’s
when I really get to play,” he said.
“[1 get to] see what they can do;
see what they’re capable of; see
what I can expect. This yearl can
expect a lot.”

Despite the rigorous practice
schedule, students only earn one
credit for University Chorus.

“I want it to be fun; something
they can do on top of an academic
schedule,” Myers said.

With new auditions and strate-
gies to focus on each singer’s
voice, students say Myers has
made a huge impact on the pro-
gram.

“It’s deﬁnitely made me a bet-
ter musician,” senior Kristine

Holda said. “I played an instru-
ment in high school, and I new
music some, but the voice takes
so much more control. You’re
more self-aware than you are with
an instrument.”

Myers said he enjoys being ac-
cessible to his students. He wants
them to feel they can approach
him with anything from their dif-
ﬁculty with classes to their life
issues.

“He’s so committed to what he
does,” Holda said. “I’ve heard
him make someone who couldn’t
carry a tune sing. He’s a great
teacher. The choir is Jeny Myers.”

The choir will be performing
in Lee Chapel this Friday for Par-
ents Weekend from 8-9pm. There
will also be an A Capella concert
on Saturday from 6-8pm.

Not your typical love story

Controversial and profound, The Shape of Things provokes students to question and evaluate their beliefs

By Nadja Wolfe

STAFF WRITER

“I don’t believe in good and
bad people,” said playwright
Neil LaBute Friday at an open
Q&A. “I believe in people who
do good and bad things.” The
Shape of Things, playing
through Monday at the Johnson
Theatre in the Lenfest Center,
challenges audiences to see be-
yond the characters to why and
what they believe.

Evelyn (sophomore Paten
Hughes) and Adam (junior
Charles Barbour), sans garden,
meet at the museum where he
works—and she’s planning to
deface a statue.

She’s a self-conﬁdent and de-
termined grad student, he’s a shy
and homely indebted undergrad,
and the audience is ready for a
typical girl-tums—guy-into—a-stud
happily ever after story includ-
ing some soaps-worthy drama.

But LaBute’s play doesn’t
traverse along to a fairytale end-
ing, instead exploring the nature
of art within a highly controver-
sial framework.

At Evelyn’s encouragement
and manipulation, Adam begins
to change. He exercises and eats
healthily, although he says he
hates it, replaces his unfashion—
able glasses with contacts, even
gives away a jacket he’s worn
every day for years.

His engaged friends Phillip (
Joshua Nettinga ‘O7L) and Jenny
( sophomore Lisa Reppell) note

the changes with approval—and
Evelyn with distrust and confu-
sion.

The cast performed marvel-
ously in challenging roles.
Hughes’ Evelyn was remark-
able, showing the audience what
she thinks with when her actions
could potentially be very dis-
tracting.

tures the character so well one
isn’t sure he doesn’t actually ex-
ist. Nettinga gives a strong per-
formance as Phillip down to
great body language. And
Reppell is completely believable
as the almost too sweet, lonely
Jenny somewhat overpowered
by Phi1lip’s personality.

W&L professor Tom Ziegler
succeeds as a director in bring-

GREG ZIMMERMAN / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
Paten Hughes and Charles Barbour in LaBute’s play about the concessions we make to social standards

ing out the full dimensionality
of the characters, and organizes
their interactions on stage very
naturally.

The set, designed by W&L
Theater professor Owen Collins
and technical director Tom
Anderson, is amazing in its ver-
satility and function, serving
as a museum, an apartment, a
bedroom, a playground (with

swings), and a display of all
Evelyn’s art. Changes of scene
are covered by edgy music and
sound design by alum Josh
Harvey and Jennifer Anderson,
Lenfest technical director, and
include original compositions by
Harvey.

The music complements the
costume designs of T. Anderson,
of which particularly Evelyn’s

wonderfully highlights her char-
acter.

The Shape of Things pro-
vokes audiences to see beyond
the surface of people, art, soci-
ety, and the play, which can it-
self be understood on several
levels.

Audiences will likely find
Evelyn’s actions reprehensible
at the least; however, they
should appreciate her message,
and see how what society does
regularly is no different or bet-
ter than her project. .

Art is controversial and com-
plex, as LaBute shows through
the feelings he evokes in the au-
dience and writes in his charac-
ters.

When the play is done, one
must wonder at which is worse,
“sculpting” another human be-
ing through manipulation, or
changing oneself solely because
of what another person says or
thinks.

This different view of moral-
ity and art causes the audience
to reevaluate what they think and
believe. But whatever result,
indifference, the cardinal sin of
the play, will not be the result.

“Difference is good. . .Only
indifference is suspect,” says
Evelyn, recalling words of
LaBute from Friday afternoon:
the beauty of art is that people
can look at the exact same thing
and have completely different
opinions. The Shape of Things
is a play well—made in every as-
pect that shouldn’t be missed.

ey are more like my broth-
. l and sisters,” she said about
hercousiiis. Having a close fam-
urged Futrell on to a career
ere she could be immersed
h the company of others.
Futrell attended Virginia
mmonwealth University as an
iergraduate, intending to be-
ne Dr. Futrell, M.D., before
' school years were through.
“Then, I was introduced to
emistry,” she said as she
ised to laugh. “I decided [the
:dica1 profession] was prob-
.y not my calling.”
Futrell chose instead to ma-
in psychology.
In graduate school at
ngwood College (now Uni-
rsity) in Farmville, Va, she
)se a concentration of Com-

 

“I am hard on students
because I have high
expectations of them.

I see potential in them.”

TAMARA FUTRELL, Asslstant Dean ofstudonu and Mul1icu|!uralAﬂa|m

munity and College Counseling
to go with her Masters of Science
in Education.

The concentration got her
ready to counsel college kids —
which is a skill that Washington
and Lee students are glad she
has.

After graduation, she headed
to Hollins University to the Of-
fice of Housing and Residence
Life.

Before long, Futrell was,

working directly with students in
the Office of First Year — the
equivalent of our Dean Leonard.
Soon, the university had added
a Sophomore Programs to the
ofﬁce.

“We realized that the students
leaving our institution were do-
ing so at the beginning or at the
end of their sophomore year,”
said Futrell.

Administrators began to give

the same amount of attention to

the sophomores as they were giv-
ing the freshman. This was an
easy task, as all four class years
at Hollins have to live on cam-
pus.

“It was very easy to organize
things in the residence halls,”
said Futrell.

How did Washington and Lee
find her? Well, said Futrell, she

kind of found W&L.

“I met Dawn Watkins two
years prior to coming to Wash-
ington and Lee,” she said.

She worked with Watkins at
conferences and programs, and
they worked together very well.

Visiting W&L and Watkins,
Futrell once met her predecessor.
After being introduced to him,
she announced “I want your job.”

When he left, she applied for
the position.

Futrell is excited to be work-
ing with her friend, Watkins.

“She’s brilliant and such a for-

ward-thinker. She’s really pro-

gressive.”l

Futrell serves as the Assistant
Dean of Students and
Multicultural Affairs. Various
jobs fall to her, including advis-
ing and working with various
multicultural student organiza-
tions, something she has a pas-
sion for.

Futrell serves as the faculty
advisor to eight different orga-
nizations, including MSA and
Joyful Noise.

In addition, she often works
with ﬁve other organizations that
fall under the multicultural
office, including GSA and
PAACE.

“My role as faculty advisor

differs with every organization,”
Futrell said. “It depends on who
the executive counsel is and what
role they want me to play.”

Futrell makes sure to use the
term “multicultural” instead of
the more commonly used term
“minority.”

“There are so many negative
connotations" of the word,
Futrell said. “It has a sense of
superiority and inferiority in it.”

Futrell uses “multicultural”
because “it emphasizes the fact
that this person is different — in
a good way. ”

She also assists in training the

Residence Life Staff, something A

she has been doing since her
Hollins days.

Washington and Lee’s phi-
losophy to training, said Futrell,
is to“help students be good men-
tors to other students.”

In all the ways Futrell works
with students, there is one thing
that remains the same.

“She’s blatantly honest with
you,” admits E’Lon Cohen, ’07,
something she thinks is the rea-
son that Futrell is well—liked and
a trusted mentor among students.

Futrell agrees. “I am hard on
students because I have high ex-
pectations of them,” she said
simply. “I see potential in them.”

The times are a-changin’... and so should the trend for male Presidents

By Ashley Brightwell
COLU MNIST

As Washington and Lee cel-
ebrates the twenty-ﬁrth anniver-
sary of the presence of women
at the University this year, it’s
hard to comprehend how
women can be kept from posi-
tions of power within the Uni-
versity itself.

In spite of equally qualiﬁed
women applying for higher po-
sitions, the jobs of President,
Provost and deans more often
go to men.

In fact, in the over 250 years
since this school was estab-
lished, there have only been a

handful of female deans, such as
Dawn Watkins, the current Dean
of Students.

The University needs to under-
stand that without varying per-
spectives, we can only exist in a
state of stagnation. The integra-
tion of new viewpoints into posi-
tions of power is vital for growth
and change.

After over 250 years of male
Presidents at Washington and
Lee, isn’t it about time we had
some change?

There is nothing about women
that make them any less capable
of performing the job of President
of the University than men, and
in fact, the change from a male to

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

female President might actually
help the University to modem-
ize and move past certain out-
dated patriarchal values and tra-
ditions that have dictated the
way of life at our University
since the eighteenth century.

When the school became co-
ed, the core value of the school,
“be a gentleman”, simply be-
came “be a gentleman (or
gentlewoman)” and it often feels
as though the rules of conduct
are thus geared toward men,
with women just tacked on and
not really considered.

After all, it seems a little
sketchy that while cheating is

considered an honor violation,

rape is not.

A female president would be
able to work toward changing the
values of the University to really
include women.

It is high time that Washing-
ton and Lee embraced the twenty-
ﬁrst century view of equality and
allowed a woman into a position
of power that has so long been a
male-occupied role.

The presence of a woman as
president of the University is cru-
cial to ﬁnally completing the in-
tegration of women into Washing-
ton and Lee.

After all, this is a time to cel-
ebrate the presence of women in
the University, isn’t it?

Little White book

Honor violations not defined in book--and that’s how it should be,al|eges reader

To the Editor:

I must respectfully disagree
with Caley Anderson’s conclusion
that the Honor System needs to be
reevaluated (Ring-tum Phi, Octo-
ber 10, 2005). Mr. Anderson and I
have both worked at the sharp edge
of the Honor System as Honor
Advocates, but I cannot agree with
his arguments.

Mr. Anderson begins by saying
that the White Book speciﬁcally
outlines lying, cheating and steal-
ing as clear Honor Violations.

The relevant text reads, “Al-
though dishonorable conduct can-
not be codified, lying, cheating‘
and stealing are clear examples of
breaches of the Honor System.”
This would be troublesome on its
own, but in the context of the Phi-
losophy section of the White
Book, the passage ﬁts nicely, es-
pecially with its preceding sen-
tence: “The Honor System con-

I demns only acts that the current

student generation views as
breaches of the community’s
trust.” Taken alone, Mr.
Anderson’s example is problem-
atic. Read in context, however, it
fulﬁlls its purpose, advising read-

-ers that students alone determine

what constitutes dishonorable be-

havior.

My critics will argue that the
mere act‘ of offering examples of
possible honor violations consti-
tutes a codiﬁcation of honor, but
I ﬁrmly believe that students need
some sort of example in order to
understand Honor Violations. Mr.
Anderson’s hypothetical of lying
to an arsonist to protect the C-
School nicely illustrates a case that
no EC would prosecute, but with-
out the current text, how are we
to explain our Honor System to
freshmen each year? Arriving at
W&L is chaotic enough, and
freshmen especially need some
sort of guideline to understand
dishonorable behavior. Without
those words, EC members would
be faced with telling incoming
freshmen every year simply that
they know dishonorable behavior
when they see it. If that standard
didn’t work for the Supreme Court
in dealing with obscenity cases, I
don’t see how it can work for our
Honor System.

Mr. Anderson’s second pro-
posal, to amend the White Book
to classify all convicted students
as “withdrawn,” even if found
guilty in an Open Hearing, hinges
on the argument that the “dis—

and Lee University,

missed” notation is a powerful
disincentive for students to appeal
to an Open Hearing. That much is
true, but Mr. Anderson ignores the
reasoning for that disincentive at
his peril.

At an Open Hearing, the EC
itself is tried along with the ac-
cused student. The EC must
present its case and its reasoning,
while the accused student must
convince the jury that the EC is
mistaken.

An honorable student, wrong-
fully convicted by the EC, will
have no problem proving such a
case. The disincentive is to pre-
vent every single Closed Hearing
giving way to an Open Hearing
because the Honor System trusts
the EC to know their fellow stu-
dents and to judge accordingly.

An Open Hearing after every
case would betray that trust, and
students would eventually grow
tired of seeing every case re—ar-
gued in Lee Chapel, to the detri-
ment of any legitimate appeals that
might come before a student jury.
The Open Hearing is there as a ﬁ-
nal appeal for those students who
are wrongfully convicted by the
EC, not as yet another burden for
convicted students to undertake
before withdrawing.

Fundamentally, we must trust
the EC to carry out its duties. I
have known and worked with EC
President Charlie Yates since his
freshman year, and I have com-
plete conﬁdence in the Commit-
tee and him to weigh each case
carefully and in accordance with
the students’ conception of honor.
Students elect the EC speciﬁcally

because the student body as a
whole cannot oversee every single
case. Their input into the Honor
System consists of electing those
representatives, and though can-
didates do not run on platforms
outlining to their conceptions of
honor, those elected are trusted by
their peers. If any student does not
share my conﬁdence in the Com-
mittee, I ask him or her: did you
run for ofﬁce, or take an active
role in encouraging someone you
trust to do so?

If not, reconsider your doubts.
I lost the EC President election
during the winter of my junior year
by a wide margin, and while my
pride suffered somewhat, I contin-
ued defending accused students to
the best of my ability. I am pleased
to call that my contribution to the
Honor System. What is yours?

I commend Mr. Anderson and
the Ring-tum Phi for his article,
and W&L students would do well
to heed his call to take an active
interest in the Honor System. It
has become fashionable to criti-
cize the EC and the Honor Sys-
tem over the past few years, espe-
cially since the infamous Gabe
Katz case, but I urge students to
consider that the Honor System
and its institutions are in place for
a reason. They may not be perfect,
but they are the culmination of
more than one hundred years of
trial and error at enforcing honor-
able behavior, and the student
body would do well to remember
that before changing them.

Media not doing candidates justice in looking at wrong credentials

By Justin McKeen
COLUMNIST

A month ago I bet there
weren’t 200 people on this cam-
pus who could have told you who
Harriet Miers was. Now she’s a
nominee for one of the most
prestigious appointments our
nation can bestow. A lot more
people know her name now, but
is that enough?

Appointments to the Supreme
Court are always a matter for
deep discussion. After all, those
justices are the people who have
the final say over the constitu-
tionality of legislation. Not only
that, they’re justices for life, sub-
ject to good behavior. Can any-
one picture, let alone remember,
a supreme court justice involved
in a maj-or scandal? A few have
been caught during their conﬁr-
mation, which only goes to show
why that process is so important.

The last few months have
brought two successive appoint-
ments to the Supreme Court,

which is two more than I’ve ever
paid attention to before. What’s
struck me throughout both pro-
cesses has not been the intensive
questioning of the candidates,
not the journalistic search to pro-
vide insight into the norninee’s
character and abilities, but rather
the amazing ability of Washing-
ton and the media to focus on
exactly the wrong things.
Harriet Miers is vanilla. This
woman must be the utility in-
fielder on the firm’s softball
team. Honestly, I know George
Bush likes her, I know she passed
the bar, and that’s about it. Most
people reading this are now ex-
pecting the usual plea for more
information, and you’d be right,
that’s exactly what I want, but not

I because I want to endorse or re-

ject her candidacy. Instead, I
want to know that whoever is sit-
ting on the highest court in the
land is a judge. I don’t need a
dispassionate observer. I want
someone who is intelligent
enough to hold opinions, analyze
the law, and make an argument.
If Harriet Miers gets her seat and
casts the deciding vote to repeal
Roe v. Wade, l’1l be happy. Not
because I want Roe v. Wade re-
pealed but because at least I’ll
know that someone was thinking
about the issue and making a
study of the Constitution. That’s
their job after all. We have to
trust that the Court, and that trust
derives itself from the people
that make it up.

At least I ’ll know that someone was thinking

about the issue and making a study of the

Constitution. That’s their job, after all.

 

The Republican party is in
power right now. They hold the
presidency, they hold congress,
and, whatever democrats may
claim, I’d say that’s a pretty clear
sign that they have the mandate
of the people. How long that may
last is another question, but why,
if they now have that mandate,
shouldn’t George Bush appoint
a conservative judge?

I’m not a Republican. I’m not
even a Democrat. But stripping
all the party politics out of it, I
want someone on the Supreme
Court who is qualiﬁed to inter-
pret the law. Their politics should

' be looked at, but political inﬁght-
ing shouldn’t reduce us to the *

point that we’re searching out
longtime pool-boys for the Court
because they’re nice people and
have no paper trail. Whatever
happens with Miers, I hope the
next appointee to the Court is
smart, opinionated, and last and
deﬁnitely least, shares my politi-
cal views.

School intimidates minorities

Lack of minorities symptomatic of larger problem: students’ need to diversify rather than unity

By Mallory Ruymann
CO LU MN I ST

Everyone at Washington and
Lee agrees that there are not many
problems with the school; the
grounds are meticulously main-
tained, it’s one of the best educa-
tions in the country, and social life
is fabulous.

However if you look around,
more often than not, all you will
see is white faces. Although the
school has done a good job of in-
jecting some ‘ﬂavor’ into the cam-
pus in recent years, W&L is still
considered one of the least-diverse
schools in the nation.

Why is this so? Does our repu-
tation precede us, or are we not
actively recruiting a large number
of minorities?

Many minorities are intimi-
dated to come to a school where
there is not a large base of minor-
ity students.

Without a large support-sys-
tem, many feel a heightened
awareness of their differences due
to the largely white population,
and are also generally singled out
for being a minority; be it in the
classroom, student organizations,
or the admissions process

The admissions process here at
W&L, as I understand it, does take

into account the race/ethnicity of
a prospective, but only in the cat-
egory of differences of life expe-
rience. ’ ‘ '

This policy results in the ad-
mittance of minorities who are
just as qualiﬁed as any other per-
son to be here.

However, the amount of mi-
nority students admitted is obvi-
ously not a large number. This
may be due to the fact that not
many apply; however, the num-
bers speak for themselves and
should not be as low as they are.

In order to increase the num-
ber of minority students on cam-
pus, we must start with transform-

ing the stereotype of a W&L stu-
dent. W&L must demonstrate to
the world that not every single stu-
dent who goes here is whitei and
all students need to commit to tol-
erating and befriending different
types of people.

Who each of us is will never
change, nor can anyone look past
it; however, we must all embrace
each other for our individual
uniqueness. Once we start actively
altering our attitudes towards
eachother to create a more wel-
coming environment, minority
prospectives will take notice and
hopefully W&L will be ﬁlled with
many different ﬂavors.

You should be, too.

Mary Childs, sophomore:
I can't tell you, it’s a secret.

 

Neil Sheaffer, sophomore:
I'm going to be Gilligan.

Weather or no

There is only one explanation for Mother Nature’s moodiness:

By Hugh Trout
COLUMNIST

Man, Mother Nature rolls
harder than Suge Knight these
days.

These hurricanes are becom-
ing as frustratingly repetitious as
a Gwen Stefani song. Between
Lexington ﬂuctuating by 40 de-
grees everyday and some states
wondering if they are going to
exist this time next week, Mother
Nature is trying to tell us some-
thing, and I think it is high time
we start to ﬁgure out what the
hell that something is.

I know what all of you are
thinking: Hugh, its plain to see
that Mother Nature just doesn’t
like this whole Ashlee Simpson
comeback and is venting her
frustration. Good point reader
and I agree that even though it is
by far the most obvious reason,
it is also the most probable.

Lets face it, Ashlee Simpson
i_sn’t talented and should leave
the singing to her more talented
sister (same thing goes for
Hillary Duff’s sister: I don’t
know who you are, but please get
out of the way so your talented
sister can entertain me).

But here at the Phi we don’t
just speculate and barely scratch
the surface, not at all. What we
do is speculate, barely scratch the
surface and are inﬂammatory
enough to incite some reader to
write an equally over-the-top re-
sponse to something all other
readers forgot about ﬁve minutes

Anatomy of the frat hat

With all the effort to dress just right, why is the filthy hat such a fashion necessity?

By Tim Livingston
COLUMNIST

I dwell on one mystery for at
least fifteen minutes a day. What
is the fascination with dirty hats?

Men at our fine institution
thoroughly enjoy telling the
W&L community they are mem-
bers of a prestigious fraternity
through their apparel. I have no
problem with this aspect of our
school.

However, I am perplexed why
ﬁlthy hats ﬁt into a style that in-
cludes ridiculously over—priced
shirts, pants, and shoes.

The first thing you learn when
you join many fraternities is how
to dress.

There is a ﬁve hour class that

several frat’s make their pledges .

sit through in order to learn the
subtle intricacies of dressing like
a proper W&L Fratty McFrat
boy.

Sadly, I’m sure that half of the
people who read that last sen-
tence instantly believed that
there is a class that perpetuates
the homogeneity at our school.

There is not, but the point is
that if there was one, there would
be a weighty portion devoted to
how to wear your ﬁlthy ‘hats.

The first step involves buying
a $15 college hat (South Caro-
lina, Vanderbilt, Alabama are
popular) and then tying that cap
to a wooden stick (about 8-9
feet) and then driving through a
dirt ﬁeld while dragging the hat
along.

after they read it.

So, in keeping with that tra-
dition let me list a few of my
theories as to what is up with the
weather. And remember, this is
not something you should actu-
ally take seriously (sort of like
how everyone treats the speak-
ing tradition) and if you find
yourself getting frustrated just
picture watching someone walk
into a glass door and them try-
ing to find a way to make it look
not awkwardly hilarious.

If you are still angry after that,
you are living your life in a joy-
less manner that will only lead
to high blood pressure and thin-
ning hair and for that I apologize
and suggest that maybe you
should have gone to Davidson.

While Burger King is rocking
our socks off with their King
commercials that convey an
overwhelming sense of awk-
wardness but also reassurance
and comfort, McDonald’s is do-
ing a very poor job of compet-
ing. “I’mlovin’ it?”

Well, Mother Nature is not.
What McDonald’s needs to do is
make fast food sexy again. The
Paris Hilton commercials were
good so McDonald’s needs to
show Hardies how they rock it:
Jessica Alba, anyone? Damn I’m
good. Or if not sexy, dangerous.

I know if I saw 50 Cent and
the Harnburglar bust some faces
up and then cruise through the
drive—through to pick up some
McShakes, I would be at
McDonald’s in a heart beat

By the end of this arduous
process, the once pristine item
should obtain a brownish tint that
needs to be mixed with about a
pint of sweat for the concoction
to work and be fratty enough for
daily use.

Obviously wearing a clean hat
is totally out of the question.
When a guy sports his dirty hat
backwards with his conditioned
locks of frat hair oozing out of
the front while representing a
southern school from his home
state...the feeling can only be
described as bliss.

My only dilemma is that I
have neither a southern state to
be a symbol of, nor adequate hair
for the previously illustrated ooz-
ing out effect that is required for
the appropriate look.

Another problem arises when
I realize that I lack the dorky sun-
glasses with the band to keep the
super fratty shades across my
neck at all times. _

Perhaps the absence of these
essentials is why I feel obli-
gated to question the queer-
est style at our school.
When I say queer, I of
course mean odd, and
when I say odd I mean
terrible.

After over a year
at this place I have
found many holes
in our institu-
tion; for
e x -

PMS

showing people that I’m as cool
as they are. Right now, if people
say they are going to the drive
through I’m thinking the idea is
McAwful and walk on over to
Donny T’s.

Or -maybe Mother Nature is
just upset at the new O.C. sea-
son. And not to be a hater, but it
really has gone down hill. They
are already recycling plot lines,
the new characters are as sur-
prising as another allegation of
misconduct against Tom DeLay.

First big let down of the sea-
son: crazy lady is a scam artist
and not an obsessed lesbian. I
’m not very happy about that, and
am seriously consider writing a
stern letter reflecting my frustra-
tion. But then again, Mother Na-
ture seems a lot more pissed off
than I am.

I think another likely possi-
bility is the state of professional
sports.

My guess is Mother Nature
agrees with me on several points:
I have no problem with baseball
players doing all the steroids they
want, I want my NBA players to
wear whatever the hell they want,
and the more players assaulting
drunk fans in the stands the bet-
ter. If T.O. wants to have a ﬁre-
work show in the end zone, bring
it on.

I’m even fine easing rules
against drug use during the play
of the game. You have to admit
it would be pretty sick to watch
Lavar Arrington on speed lay out
some kicker.

ample, the administration refuses
to respect the student body.

However, in spite of these
harrowing aspects of our school,
my main problem remains these
absurd hats.

My first question will be pro-
posed to the select ladies in the
audience who are enthralled by
this primitive form of headwear.

What is intriguing about the
ﬁlth? Do you enjoy rubbing your
hands against the oily hair which
can only accumulate with hours
of pressing against what is in es-
sence dirt? Do you take off your
man’s hat and smell his manly
musk in order to achieve some
type of sensual experience?

Do the women at our school
not understand that they can eas-
ily eradicate something ridicu-
lous like the dirty hats by simply
saying to a man, “Clayton
(or other
8 9 '

 
    
   
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
   
  
 
  
 
 

neric W&L male name), you are
an attractive male without that
stupid hat, and because my hands
are greasier than freshly cooked
bacon after we hook up, I’d ap-
preciate if you stopped the whole
dirty hat thing.”

If one girl speaks these words
to her signiﬁcant other the dirty
hat fad would dissolve faster than
pogs in fifth grade.

I have only one question for
the guys who buy into the ﬁlthy
hat phenomenon. Who was the
genius who thought it would be
cool to ditch clean hats and only
wear dirty ones?

Who woke up in the morning
and said, “I’m sick of wearing all
clean clothing, so I’ll wear all
spotless attire combined with
that old LSU hat I was dragging
on my 9 foot wooden pole
through the dirt ﬁeld yesterday?”
People at this school are
outrageous.

University administration plans major renovations for school’s iconic Colonnade

 

Field hockey standout cites team support as key to success

By Katherine Greene
MANAGJNG EDITOR

Field hockey is Kendall
Korte’s life.

Fighting through an injury to
her groin for the majority of the
season, Korte deﬁed all ‘odds,
being named to the all-
tournament and all~ODAC

teams after the Generals won the
ODACS two weeks ago.

“Going into theseason, [the

team’s} goal was to win the
/ODACS, and we made it,” she
said. 3

During the summer, coach

Wendy Orrison mailed each of

the teammates a card listing the
goals of the team for the year.

The team surprised the
school by meeting those goals
and winning the 0DACs, the
first ﬁeld hockey team in W&L
history to do so.

“We had the mindset going
into the season that we were
going to win,” said Korte. “We
knew it was important to host,
especially because we’re
definitely a turf team now.”

She explained that playing
field hockey on turf is a
completely different game,
saying that it is much faster-
paced, with the added advantage

that only one other team in the
division has a turf ﬁeld.

“We only lost one game at
home,” Korte said, naming the
turf as a contributing factor to
the team’s nearly-unbeatable
status at home.

Field hockey remains a year-

round activity to Korte, who
, spent the summer working with

a trainer who helps out with the
national Women’s field hockey
team.

‘.‘I did all the same workouts

as they did,” she saidgadding

that the toughness of her
regimen improved her
athleticism.

'When"'mos.t peoplejﬂiink about Washington and

Co10m1ade’s image is everywhere: on t-shirts, posters,
and swipecards.,’i,A1th0ugh it is the most historic and
iconicipart of campus, it is about to receive an update.

Because of the lack of technology and inadequate
facilities of the classrooms, the buildings making up the
colonnade—Newcomb, Payne, Washington, Robinson
and Tucker Halls—-will undergo a major renovation in
the coming years, Joe Grasso, Vice President of
Administration and Campus Chair of the Space Planning
Committee, said.

Grasso, although he is the overseer of the project,
said it was not his idea to renovate the Colonnade.

“[Former president] Tom Burish, before he left, had
quiet discussions about the need to renovate the
Colonnade,” Grasso said. “[Current acting president
Harlan] Beckley came out with a list of eight goals he
hopes to fulﬁll, or at least start, at W&L, and that’s what’s
prompted us forward. Colonnade renovation is one of
his key goals.”

University architect Tom Contos said that faculty
members with ofﬁces and classrooms in the Colonnade
also expressed the need for an upgrade.

“There has been discussion over the past couple of
years by faculty in these buildings expressing the desire
to have the spaces renovated,” Contos said. “After
modernizing other parts of campus, such as the commons
and the Lenfest center, we see there is a need to update
these buildings.”

Grasso agreed that the recent renovations of other
buildings on campus has left the Colonnade’s classrooms
seemingly defunct.

BEHIND
BARS

Here ’s to laughing at the expense of those who
‘learned their lessons this weekend. News editor
Jacob Geiger took a peek at this week’s police

reports to see what you ’ve been up to...don’t

worry, we only used your initials!

Not twice as Nice

Police kindly informed SC of
Kennet Square, PA that he
cannot travel at nearly twice
the speed limit. In Lexing-
ton, it appears 25 means 25,
not 48. Mr. SC will be fur-
ther reminded when he pays
his speeding ticket. Bear that
in mind next time you swing
through town, please.

Another good reason to
obey the spped limit

At least 36-year-old PC of
Richmond was only going 42
in the 25 zone. That, how-
ever, may turn out to be the
least of his worries. While
the officer would have let the
speeding off with only a
ticket, PC’s refusal to cooper-
ate, DUI, and Concealed
Weapons charges all meant
he finished his trip in the
back seat of a squad car at
1:05 on a Sunday morning.
Seeing as this is Lexington’s
second concealed weapons
violation in a month, students
may want to talk with the ad-
ministration about their
policy prohibiting firearms.
Just for the safety of the stu-
dents, of course.

The neighbors were tired

Pi Phi may be known around
campus for their weekend
late nights, but by 3:06 AM

on Sunday, October 23”‘ the
police had heard enough.
And so, without further ado,
they gave PH a ticket for
“Loud Noise.” Not ‘noise
violation’ or ‘failure to ob-
tain a proper noise permit,’
just “Loud Noise.” I guess
by 3 am the officers are too
tired to come up with more
precise descriptions on the
tickets. Anyone interested in
more information on loud
noises can attend PH’s trafﬁc
court hearing at 9 am on No-
vember 29"‘.

Aloha!

Hawaiians love to party, but
22-year-old BK of Mililani,
Hawaii learned that the Lex-
ington Police would prefer he
doesn’t party all night long.
They nabbed BF last month
at 5:15 AM on a Saturday
morning. Maybe it’s a good
thing, then, that Lambda’s
“Tropical” party broke up at
a more reasonable hour but
it’s too bad, really. The
early-moming breakfast
places around town would
have been opening up in
about two or three hours.

This might mean extra
guard duty

Just when you thought Ha-
waiians and W&L students

had a monopoly on DIP ar-

rests, VMI Keydet JN comes
along. The fun loving resi-
dent of W&L’s neighboring
institution was arrested at
1:05 AM. Maybe he wanted
to get the arrest over early so
he could make it back for
curfew. Perhaps this is also
why VMI doesn’t let the stu-
dents out most nights. What-
ever the case may be, Behind
Bars suspects that the Com-
mandant was not pleased.

And now for something new
Finally, for the very first time,
Behind Bars has a felony to
report. BF, a 26-year-old fe-
male resident of Lexington,
was arrested for welfare fraud
and not one, not two, but four
counts of perjury. So not
only does BF  to cheat the
government, she lies about
her efforts. BF, cases like
yours are what gets the W&L
College Republicans so
worked up about welfare.
Anyone interested in learning
more about BF may have to
wait a bit; a court date has
not yet been set.

Drug Bust ,

Oh the felonies... apparently
the changing leaves have
brought changing crime pat-
terns. JK of Goshen became
Rockbridge County’s latest

offender when she was

charged with obtaining pre-
scriptions by fraud. So next
time you think it’s a good
idea to borrow your friend’s
Ritalin prescription to have a
little fun, remember 26-year-
old JK and just say no. At
least if you get caught drunk
you’re just facing a misde-
meanor; fraudulent prescrip-
tions could ship you off to
the Rockbridge Country
Penitentiary.

Hide the children

Finally, a big BOO from the
Phi to GG of Clearwater,
Florida. Ms. G, age 44, basi-
cally killed Lexington’s Hal-
loween spirit by getting ar-
rested for public drunken-
ness at 9:50 pm. 9:50!
Goodness gracious. Travel-
ler hasn’t even started run-
ning at 9:50. That’s pa-
thetic, GG, and shame on
you for making a fool out of
yourself in front of innocent
children hoping for a safe,
fun evening of trick—or—treat—
ing. Please return to
Clearwater and never come
back. At least W&L students
have the decency not to get
drunk in front of trick-or-
treaters.

Colonnade upgrade on horizon

Continued from page 1

“We have a beautiful new
science facility, and are in the
process of building more space for
arts and music,” Grasso said.
“This is our chance to provide the
humanities departments with
modern teaching and learning
facilities for both faculty and
students.”

Philosophy professor Lad
Sessions teaches in Newcomb
Hall and asserted that the
colonnade is in desperate need of
an update.

“The colonnade is W&L’s
signature, and it is in the worst
shape of the entire school,”
Sessions said. “It projects an
image of shabby gentility, not of
cutting-edge education.”

It is this “cutting-edge
education” that the administration
is striving to achieve through
renovation of these historic
buildings. However, their
historical significance is an
important factor in the renewal
process, Contos said. '

“Because the buildings are a
national landmark, they will be
resorted with great care,” Contos
said. “The colonnade will retain
the same look on the exterior,
except that the exterior air

» conditioning units will not be

there.”
Grasso added that other

necessary features will be added
to the buildings in addition to air
conditioning. The buildings will
become code compliant for fire
safety (a feature which the
buildings are currently lacking),
and will also become
handicapped accessible—the
installation of elevators is “very
likely,” Grasso said. Bathrooms
will also be updated and will
become handicapped accessible,
as they are currently, as Grasso
said, “atrocious.”

Contos added that the
colonnade buildings have not
been renovated in about 70 years.

“The buildings have not been
touched since 1936 when they
were fireproofed,” Contos said.
“This project will preserve these
buildings for another 80-100
years of more practical use.”

Sessions added that the
buildings are not currently
equipped with enough space in
which to teach.

“Newcomb Hall is twice as
crowded in terms of square
footage per faculty member as the
Williams School, which has its
own complaints,” Sessions said.

Adequate electrical capacity is
another important feature that will
be added to the buildings, Grasso
said, stressing that, “if we don’t
have the electrical capacities we
need to charge the technologies
available to us, it defeats the

academic purpose of the school.”

Although there is much to be
done to update the colonnade to
match the quality of the rest of the
school, Grasso said the renovation
will be a long process, and the
administration is still its the early
planning stages.

One year ago, W&L received
a $150,000 grant from the Getty
Foundation in order to begin the
renovation process.

The Getty Foundation is an
organization that sponsors,
according to its website, “the
research, documentation, and
analysis necessary to the
development of a comprehensive
conservation plan [for]
projects [which] focus on the
historic structure and fabric of the
building(s) and address
conservation issues related to the
building’s setting.”

Grasso said that W&L used the
money to “measure and document
how important the colonnade is in
terms of historical architecture.”

“It has given us a lot of good
advice on how to maintain the
historic look of the campus,. and
lays the groundwork on the
rehabilitation of the colonnade,”
Grasso said.

Contos added that the money
will assist the university in hiring
a consultant who will create a
preservation renovation plan.

“We want to modernize the

buildings,” Contos said, “but also
preserve them as they are national
historical landmarks.”

Currently the Space Planning
Committee, comprised of faculty
and staff, is interviewing
nationally known architectural
firms, Grasso said. This interview
process will occur over the next
few weeks.

With the help of the architect,
the committee will conduct a
feasibility study to determine what
each building will house, in terms
of the number of classrooms and
offices. According to Grasso, this
should be completed by the
summer of 2006.

Then the project will enter the
design faze, wherein the architects
will start designing the interiors of
each building.

“We have two options for
renovating the interiors,” Grasso
said. “We can either gut each
building, like we did to Reed Hall,
and start from scratch, or keep the
interior structure and work with
it.”

Grasso said that the committee
prefers to keep the interior
structure of each building and
update so as not to “lose the
historical appearance” of the
buildings.

Once the design faze has
completed, construction will
begin. Grasso estimates that this
should be during the late summer

or fall of 2007.

Contos said that because of the
magnitude of the project, the
architects will employ “stage
construction,” meaning one
building will undergo renovation
at a time. Grasso said Newcomb
Hall will be the first building to
undergo renovation, which leaves
35 faculty members without office
space.

“Once the art and music
departments move from Dupont
Hall, it will serve to house those
who are forced to move because
of construction,” Grasso said.

Right now neither Grasso nor
Contos can say how long the
construction will last, nor can they
say how much the renovation will
cost. The entire cost of the project,
however, will not come from
W&L alone, Contos said.

“We don’t know how much the
project will ultimately cost,
though it will be a large dollar
number,” Contos said. “Tax
credits are typically allowed for
projects like these where historic
properties are renovated.”

In addition to hoping for help
from the government, Grasso
hopes that the school’s alumni and
other affiliates will donate to the
cost of construction.

“The plan is to raise money for
much of [the overall cost],”
Grasso said. “The administration
knows that these buildings are

iconic of the school and our goal
is to rely on philanthropy.”

Despite the cost of the project,
Sessions sees the reconstruction as
one that will improve the
university’s academics.

“The departments housed in its
buildings deserve more and better
space, and we have every
assurance from the administration
that help is on the way,” Sessions
said.

Grasso hopes the renovation
will offer students and faculty
more spaces to interact.

“We all hope the Colonnade
will provide social and acaderriic
interaction between students and
faculty,” Grasso said. “For
example, having lounge space
where students and faculty can
meet, rooms for conferences
between students, and classrooms
with air conditioning so you can
hear what’s being said. Those are
the ways we hope the university
will beneﬁt from this renovation.”

Although the exterior
appearance and historical
signiﬁcance of the Colonnade will
remain unchanged, the
administration hopes that through
renovation, alumni will return to
campus and see the colonnade not
only as a national landmark, but
also as the center of their college
education.

heart.”

This confidence in one
another led the team places they
never thought they’d go, which
is partly why they lost so quickly
in the NCAA tournament, said
Korte.

“It’s kind of a weird feeling,”
she said, on winning the ODACs
and then ending the season so
quickly.

She said that the team didn’t
play up to their abilities in the
NCAA tournament, and names
intimidation as the culprit.

“I guess it’s just sour grapes,”
she said, “but we didn’t really
know what to expect.”

The success of several
women’s athletic teams has
sparked an enthusiastic reaction
from fans, several of whom
created a facebook group in their
honor. The group, called “Uber
Fans” and started by senior Chris
Lalli, claims to be “for those who
are extremely dedicated to all
female sports teams.”

Lalli, along with friends and
fellow fans Taylor McConnell,
Dave Mackenzie, and Scott
Gosselink, attended many if not
all of the women’s ﬁeld hockey
games this year.

Gosselink said, “The main
reason that we support the ﬁeld
hockey team is because we can
relate to them as athletes
ourselves.

' “It sucks to work so hard and
have no one go to the games or
know that you play. The girls are
simply a delight.”

Korte said, “I’m actually not
friends with any of them, but the
support is awesome.”

Gelinas agreed that the
support from the men is always
helpful.

“[They] have always been
sincere supporters of our team
even when we were not breaking
records. I really appreciate their
support and it is comforting and
encouraging to see these fans at
every game,” she said.

The impending graduation of
several key players on the ﬁeld
hockey team threatens the
repetition of this season’s
victories.

“I’m really going to miss the
seniors,” Korte said. “Not only as
field hockey players and
teammates, but I’m going to miss
them more as friends.”

Despite this, Korte said she
fully intends to return to the
NCAA tournament in the
following years.

“I’m stoked that we’ve made
it so far,” she said. “Next time,
we won’t be fazed by it.”

Short by a goal

McCraw put a penalty kick in the
back of EMU’s net in the ﬁnal
minutes of the first half; it was
the midﬁelder’s third goal of the
season.

The Generals were not able to
score the equalizer in the second
half. The score held and W&L’s
season was ended giving the
squad a 9-6-2 overall (5-2-2 in
the ODAC) record.

Sophomore goalkeeper Ted
Sheedy had four saves while his
EMU counterpart, Tim Koehn,

-notched ﬁve.

“It was disappointing,” said
senior midfielder Brett

Strohsacker, “We played our

hearts out and that’s all you can
ask for.”

Indeed it was a frustrating loss
for the Generals, who possessed
the ball for nearly 70% of the
game according to the estimation
of senior captain and defender
Derrick Lott. 0

“We had our chances but we
couldn’t.put them away,” said
Lott.

The loss ends a season that
saw the Generals play in six
double-overtime games and
seven OT games overall.

The team was 3-2-2 in those
games. One of those extra time
wins came on October 18 against

Roanoke, a victory that Lott de-
scribes as “the best moment of
the season.”

The season was an up and
down one for the Generals who
had trouble building momentum
because they never won more
than two matches in a row. How-
ever they only dropped tw
straight games once. -

Sophomore forward Jack
Palmer ends the season as the
team leader in both goals (11)
and overall points (24).

Palmer is followed in points
by sophomore Josh Dodds (15)
andjunior Kyle Garcia (13).

Ted Sheedy led the Generals

in virtually every goalkeeping
statistic including wins (7), saves
(46) and shutouts (2).

Lott, the senior captain, was
quick to praise the team as a
whole when asked about the sea-
son: “Our record is a testament
to how well we played together.”

Friday’s loss ends the playing
days of seven seniors, including
Lott.

“After 17 years of playing
soccer it’s a big moment. I would
have liked to go out on top but

Paris Hilton politics

Despite an America For Dummies attitude of Blue v. Red, we’re all really purple

By Mary Childs
COLUMNIST

It’s a given fact that this is a
conservative school. I could make
all the requisite jokes about,
“Well, what do you expect, the
name LEE is in the title,” and
“Good old boy” and “rich” and
“Southem” and “white” and “frat”
and all signs point to Bush. That’s
Jim Dandy and I understand that
and I knew that when I came here,
frying pan into the ﬁre.

However. There has been a
phenomenon as of late that must
be nipped in the cradle. It is a ter-
rible and democracy-threatening
ideal. Even Bush would probably
not advocate it. He may even go
so far as to call it terrorism, be-
cause it does threaten our freedom
and our ideals. It’s the Paris Hilton
and Sean “Puffy” Combs (excuse
me, “Diddy”) approach to politi-

cal . It’s America for Dummies.

We are a land of sports lovers.
We love our Andy Roddick and
Astros and Kobe and everybody
for the blood, sweat and tears we
pay for. We thrive on adrenaline,
testosterone — our high—powered
business world loves to tell India
what to do and Hollywood can pat
itself on the back for its complete
monopoly on movie land. And
good for us. These are the fruits
of our labor.

But what got us here? What
made us so great? What is in our
blood that makes us froth at the
mouth a little any time a baseball
ﬂies near the stands? It’s a basic
part of our American genome —
we’re intensely competitive.

Competition is a relatively
healthy thing; it makes us do our
best, it pushes us when we want
to be lazy, and sometimes we win.
Fabulous. But a problem arises

when we try to mix work and play,
baseball and Bush. What happens
is we forget those magnificent
many-syllabled words like “bipar-
tisanship,” and
“antidisestablishmentarianism,”

, “teamwork,” “passing legisla-

tion,” and “democracy,” and we
start thinking that this is a sports
game, What’s the score?

When Rehnquist died I an-
nounced it to some of my friends
and noted that Bush would have
another nomination to the Court.
A friend of mine (who is slightly
more liberal than your average
bear here) (so like, moderate) and
I explained to a completely Red
friend the possible implications in
terms of Roe v. Wade. This is dan-
gerous for your uterus, we ex-
plained. We could be f-ed, in more
ways than one. Red Friend appar-
ently didn’t follow. “Well, Great!”
she said with enthusiasm. Awk-

ward pause. “Because if you’re f-
ed, then that means we’re win-
ning! ha-hall”

Reread that.

This is the watered down po-
litical game that we’re playing.
We’re playing Red v. Blue, Bush
v. anyone, Righteous Right v.
Bleeding Hearts. But much like
Paris missed the registration dead-
line, we’re missing the point. The
point of the two-party system, of
the more-than-one-party-system is
more along the work-together-
and-make-progress, checks—and-
balances side of things. There is
no scoreboard here. No one should
“lose” this game. It’s a bunch of
blind people holding each others
hands and fumbling down the path

Caley Anderson gives his take
on the good, the bad, and the ugly.

0 White Book Review.
Come to the meetings that will
work to change the White
Book, every Thursday at
7:45pm in the University
Commons. W&L students,
faculty, and staff are welcome
to propose and discuss pos-
sible changes with the Review
Committee. This only happens
once per three years- get in-
volved!

0 La France.

The real causes of the riots are
cultural. France demands po-
litico-social conformity of its
citizens, and politico-social
conformity is not something
that most’Muslims are willing
to get into. It’s tough to say
who’s to blame, but one
thing’s for sure- the damage
and deaths are good for no
one.

0 The Hold ‘Em Poker
hand of Pocket Jacks.

In the recent IM poker tour-
nament, EIGHT people were

sent packing on this hand, in-

0 Winter Break.

It’s STH.L only two weeks?
I’ve never met ANYONE
who was against having a
three—week long Winter
Break. If the academic year
runs to June 8 or 9, I’m sure
very few people would care.
If you live far away from

the opposite side of the coun-
try), the two week Winter

The death of dating

WHY WORK FOR WHAT IS FREE

RANDOM PLAY IS NOT OKAY

By Ashley Brightwall
COLU M NIST

It’s Saturday night, and you
know what that means.

Through the course of the week
you’ve received various emails
from frats (as well as notes stuck
to your door) declaring what
bands, DJs and alcoholic bever-
ages will be featured this week-
end.

Now, it’s time to go to these
parties, under the pretense of ac-
tually wanting to hear the bands,

. get drunk and find that special

someone of the evening.

It will be incredibly romantic
and meaningful of course: having
deep conversations over Natty
Lite, engaging in sketchy dancing
in the middle of a crowded room
that feels like it’s about one hun-
dred and ten degrees, and then
finding a secluded room, or
comer...or maybe just saying to
hell with it and making out in the

middle of the dance ﬂoor, only to
forget the person’s name later.

Ah, young love.

Here at W&L, hooking up is a
perfectly normal part of any week-
end. I’m not saying that this is al-
ways a bad thing.

Every so often people just need
to be able to have fun without any
strings attached or feeling any
guilt later.

However, hooking up has com-
pletely replaced dating on this
campus, to the point where the
only time people really interact
with the opposite sex is at frat par-
ties.

Can anyone really ﬁnd a mean-
ingful connection with all the al-
cohol and loud music? Can you
even ﬁnd out the person’s name?

It’s just not healthy to limit re-
lationships to hooking up on
weekends, even if it’s what some
call “hooking up exclusively”,
where both individuals meet up
every weekend and limit their in-

teractions to one another. Some
consider this a relationship, but
there are far too many problems
involved.

In these situations, it is too easy
for one party to become more in-
volved than the other, ending in
heartbreak when the trysts even-
tually end.

Then you ask yourself, if you
really have a connection with this
person, why do you never see each
other outside of parties?

This sort of “relationship” just
isn’t healthy.

We need to work toward facili-
tating healthier and more stable
interactions between the sexes,
which means not limiting our-
selves to random play.

If we don’t allow ourselves to
develop healthy relationship hab-
its now, how will we ever func-
tion after college, in a world that
doesn’t center around frat parties
and the ever present possibility of
a random hookup?

By Justin McKeen
COLU M N IST

What’s the big deal with dat-
ing? Certain people (read, fe-
males) at W&L seem to regard this
awkward and uncomfortable prac-
tice with some kind of irrational
fondness. I say irrational because
any sane person can see that din-
ner and a movie don’t bring you
any closer to someone than talk-
ing in the co-op or catching din-
ner in the d—hall, neither of which
would qualify as dates where I
come from. Not only that, but dat-
ing brings with it a whole host of
problems: when is it time for the
ﬁrst kiss, who should call whom
and where the heck am I going to
ﬁnd the 20 bucks to pay for her
dinner.

Lets all be realistic here. The
dating scene at W&L seems pretty
non-existent, yet the world still
seems to be spinning in much the
same way it always has. The most

common complaint I hear on the
subject (again, mostly from the
ladies. Ahh, who are we kidding,
entirely from the ladies), is that all
everyone here wants to do is
“hook up.” Is this a surprise to
you? Have at least eighteen years
on this earth taught you nothing
about the male psyche? You’re
pretty, we like that, A‘ follows B,
etc, etc. Hopefully you see where
I’m going here.

The most important point
though is that this lack of dating

' ISN’T bad. In fact it’s great. Girls,

when that annoying/ugly/non-polo
wearing guy (take your pick) both-
ers you, and you, for some totally
non-alcohol related reason choose
to hook up with him, THERE ARE
NO STRINGS ATTACHED! It’s
brilliant. He’s not going to
facebook you and awkwardly call
you up for a date ‘(although he
might still facebook you. Wel-
come to the modern age of stalk-

‘ing.). Sure, you don’t get those

free dinners, but you wouldn’t
want to pass up the fro-yo in the
d—hall anyway, right?

I

So now that I’ve completely ‘

destroyed any chances of ever get-
ting a date myself, let’s be serious
for a moment. Unless dating has
been a completely different expe-
rience for everyone else, I think
on the whole, we can agree that it
isn’t really that great. There are
tons of other ways to get to know
members of the opposite sex than

“dating” per se, and most of them 8

are more fun anyway. So the next
time you want to get to know a
guy (because I know guys aren’t
going to change) don’t wait for

him to ask you out. It isn’t com— '

ing. Try something creative. And
if all else fails, hook up with him.
It’s foolproof.

All angry e-mails should be
sent to mckeenj@wlu.edu where
they will be carefully read, shared
with my friends if they’re really
funny, and promptly deleted.

By Bhaskar Banerjee
CO LU M N I ST

Times are strange. Freedom is
being enforced at gunpoint, real-
ity is being pre-packaged into 24
minute episodes shown on TV,
and everywhere everything is for
sale.

So, with Jim Morrison croon-
ing “strange days have found us”
over my old speakers I was seized
with a sudden and frantic urge to
write stuff down, and give my
opinion on the world and culture
and the way things are going.

Why not? I thought, college
brochures are always talking about
diversity of thought, about every-
one beneﬁting from listening to
different opinions, and similar
stuff which makes us feel all warm
and fuzzy and democratic.

I’m an international student,
with different views on a lot of
things, I thought, and so of course
the good people will benefit from
my eloquently penned socio—po—
litical rants.

And so here I am, contemplat-
ing the strange going-on’s in this
weird and ruthless new century.
Everything’s peachy, the suits on
top tell us with their smug grins,
the light of freedom and truth and
all that’s good is being delivered
to grateful desert savages, and the

3 policeman is your friend.

But of course, the grim and
twisted realities of this foul year
are another story, and it is impos-
sible for anyone to deny this with-
out retreating into heavy sedation.
Even if you are one of those who
thinks that a war in which one side
armed with big tanks and big guns
blasts an essentially deprived citi-
zenry into a new era of truth and
justice is right, things are bad.

Veterans are speaking
out, families who have seen, up
close and personal, the cold hy-

pocrisy of the war machine.
300,000 protestors gathered at the
White House last month, I read,
and many veterans spoke about
the many atrocities, on both sides,
committed during the fraudulent
war in the desert lands.

And then I heard Bush giving
another speech on freedom, de-
mocracy, and I was suddenly in
the grip of a cold and desolate fear.
Holy Jesus, I thought, clutching a
whiskey-soaked cigarette packet
to my heart, how much longer will
this thing last?

Freedom? Ha. Today freedom
is merely having 600 channels on
the TV to choose from. We are all
so scared of losing our home the-
ater systems, our clever little de-
signer furniture, and all those
other gadgets and widgets which
define men in this age of the holy
consumer, that we aren’t free to
do anything with our lives any
more.

And on top of that, our leaders
scare us even more, and you’d
think you couldn’t walk the streets
anymore without being croaked by
some savage foreigner.

Even people like journalists
and lobbyists who want to make a
difference quickly realize that the
worlds political structure has been
so hijacked by corporate barons
and greasy sheikhs that they don’t
have any chance of bringing about
change.

Fear hit me when I submitted
this little opinion piece to the pa-
per: what if some goon in some
nazi law enforcement agency saw
these decidedly dissenting opinion
pieces in print, written by a for-
eigner, no less.

They’d come right after my
pinko tree-hugger ass, shotguns
blazing. And if, like me, you are a
165 pound Indian with long greasy
hair, usually loaded on cheap
booze, there are few places to hide
in Lexington.

» LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Alum blasts
dearfs meddling

To the Editor:

I am writing in response to
Marshall Rule’s article “Dean
Swings Left” in the October 27"‘
edition of The Phi.

I am incensed by Dean
Mayock’s blatant violation of
W&L’s unique system of student
governance.

Those of you who know me
are probably not surprised by my
reaction considering my personal
political views and the fact that
I was a member of the Contact
Committee.

Ignore my views, and ignore
yours for a moment. Look at the
more fundamental problem that
Dean Mayock’s request to bring
a “politically liberal” speaker
poses.

Meddling by the
administration into activities
solely governed by student
organizations with student
tuition dollars intended for
student academic programming
chips away at an invaluable
learning experience for the
leaders of those organizations.

While I certainly learned a lot
in the classrooms of the C-
School, I learned even more in
the Commons cubicles, sorority
house chapter room, and co-op
lunch meetings through my
leadership and involvement in
student organizations. ,

One of the many special
aspects of W&L is the enormous
opportunity afforded to students
to take charge and make a
discemable impact as a leader.

W&L’s heritage promotes
student governance.

Student governance is
precisely why the Honor System
is able to exist so strongly today.
The EC allocates tuition dollars
to student organizations to
provide a more well-rounded
educational experience for the
members of those groups and for
the student body as a whole.

When the administration
steps in attempting to regulate
and limit that experience, it
deprives those student leaders
from learning in their capacity
and applying their own
judgment.

If the student leadership
makes a poor decision, they
should be afforded that
opportunity. Mistake and
controversy are also all vital
parts of the learning experience.

As a former participant in
those late—night meetings and
heated deliberations, I am fully
confident in the intelligence and
maturity of the students making
such decisions. Who better than
students to determine what other
students will respond to?

As a law student in a very
different environment than
W&L, I have had the opportunity
to get to know my new
classmates who come from a
broad array of undergraduate
experiences. Every single one is
amazed when I tell them about
W&L, particularly the student
organizations. They can’t
believe that we have an effective

Honor System run solely by
students.

They think I’m over-
exaggerating when I tell them
that over 90 percent of the
student body takes an active role
in our Mock Convention with
negligible faculty input. They
are shocked by the budget given
to the Fancy Dress Committee

and the overwhelming task of ‘

putting on one of the best parties
in the south.

The students rule the roost at
W&L. That is why we graduate
with much more than honors in
a particular subject matter. We
gain insight in balancing the
increasingly diverse interests of
the student body, in knowing our
administrators and working
WITH them (not for them), and
in attending to the Lexington
community at large.

Student leaders work for one
group: the students. They are the
future graduates, alumni,
benefactors and trustees of the
University. Their interests will
remain in Lexington through

, changes in the administration.

The students have earned the
right to go to W&L and are
capable to perform the
responsibilities that go in hand
with being Washington and Lee
student.

Dean Mayock, let them have
the full and complete education
W&L has afforded so many
students before them.

Colleague defends Mayock from student accusations

To the Editor:

If an academic Associate
Dean does his or her job well,
he or she gets little praise or
credit—the university just seems
to be running smoothly.

I can’t fault students for not
understanding this. The title
does not confer a great deal of
power and inﬂuence, but instead
demands an ethic of service:
professors like Ellen Mayock,
who came to academe because
they love and excel at teaching,
research, and writing, put their
chosen work on the back burner ‘
for three years in order to
administer the complex
academic support systems most
of us would rather not worry
about

On top of this job and its very
long hours, Dean Mayock,
because she is so exceptional in
her desire to serve the university

. community, has been working

incredibly hard on this year of
Celebrating Women at
Washington and Lee. So, you
haven’t noticed that her e—mails
come late at night, when most
parents of young children try to
grab a little sleep? I suspect she
doesn’t mind the general
obliviousness because the work

has value and integrity.

I do blame the Phi and
Marshall Rule, however, for their
misleading front—page article and
the dishonest tactics used in
“researching” it. Ellen Mayock
is not only unusually generous
and service—minded, but
scrupulously honest. If Marshall
Rule or David Kronenfeld had
described their misapprehension
to her “that the [Contact] speaker
musl come from the left,” she
would have clariﬁed it (and, not
incidentally, there wouldn’t have
been much of a story). If Mr.
Rule were concerned with
accuracy, he would have found
out that Professor Mark Rush
initiated Barbara Ehrenreich’s
visit, not the Celebrating Women
Committee. And if he were at all

committed to our supposed’

culture of civility, the tone of the
article would have been vastly
different.

If Mr. Rule meant to suggest
that many professors and
administrators are to the left of
many students, well, duh—we’re
well-educated, moderately—paid
professionals in a service field.
The demographic implications
are obvious. What “liberal”
means to most of us in this

professional context, though, is
uncensored exchange of
information and opinions in an
atmosphere of mutual respect. I
don’t want my studentsto think
exactly as I do; I just want them
to think.

If Mr. Rule, however, meant
to single out one of the only
women serving in academic
administration and let her know
she’s not welcome by distorting
her views in a splashy headline
published for Parents’ Weekend,
that’s more significant news.
Sure, we all know that some
people in our community do not
like to see women in positions

I of authority, but I did not truly

understand that the discomfort
would result in such tactics from
students, or that such unbalanced
and incredible allegations would
be implicitly endorsed by the
inﬂuential women and men who
run the Phi. As a woman
professor who has experienced
occasional rash fervor to bring
the university community
together in a positive way, I
appreciate the warning.

THE RING-TUM PHI ~

7

  been hanging the yaforg I
I posters on various campus .
f hillboards. Youth for America,‘ ;

To the Editor:

The letters page of the Phi has
seen an exchange about the White
Book procedures concerning
students withdrawing from the
University. In Ireland we have a
saying: “Is this a private ﬁght, or
can anybody join in?” I would like
to enter the lists.

On page 11, Section III,
“Executive Committee Hearing”,
Part P, “Announcement of
Verdict”, section 3, of the White
Book, it says, concerning a guilty
verdict by the EC of a closed
hearing:

“If the verdict is guilty, the
accused shall decide whether to
withdraw from the University or
to appeal the verdict to a Student
Body Hearing. The accused shall
provide written notice of this
decision to the President of the
Executive Committee within
seventy-two hours of the time of
the verdict. Upon written request,
the President of the Executive
Committee may grant an extension
of this time.”

It is important to note here that
the White Book asks the student
to make a decision, before asking
the student to provide evidence of
that decision. What is this
decision? Apparently, it is to
withdraw from the University, or
to appeal the Verdict of the closed
hearing.

On page 12, Section IV,

“Following the Executive
Committee Hearing”, Part C,
“Withdrawal”, section 3, of the
White Book, it says, concerning a
guilty verdict by the EC of a closed
hearing:

“If the student fails to provide
written notice of the student’s
decision to withdraw or to proceed
to the Student Body Hearing, this
failure shall be construed as a
decision to withdraw. “Withdrew”
shall be noted on the student’s
official University transcript. The
administration shall then be
responsible’ for the prompt
removal of the student from the
University.”

That is, if a student provides
no evidence of a decision to
withdraw or appeal, the student is
deemed to have decided to
withdraw from the University, and
the student is withdrawn from the
University. So there is no
difference between a student who
provides written notice that she is
withdrawing from the University,
and a student who provides no
such notice. Under the eyes of the
White Book, they are both
students who have decided to
withdraw, and who are withdrawn.

But there is a problem with this
procedure.

The decision to withdraw or
not from the University is distinct
from the decision to appeal, and
it must be made under the threat

of dismissal by the University, and
not under the threat of being
withdrawn.

This fact is obscured, I think,
by the presence of an option to
appeal to a Student Body Hearing.
Remove the option to appeal, and
the problem, which has always
been present, becomes clear: the
student is asked to withdraw or
not, and if she does not withdraw,
she is withdrawn.

Imagine, by comparison, that I
am told to resign my job, or appeal
to X. And imagine that I refuse to
resign or appeal to X. According
to this procedure, it turns out that
I have resigned my job. And then
a couple of people wearing
uniforms come along and “help
me resign”. But at no point, it
seems, am I fired.

Either of the following
procedures would remove this
problem:

(1) If the student is found
guilty, the student may appeal the
verdict. If the student does not
appeal the verdict, the student is
deemed to have withdrawn from
the University.

(2) If the student is found
guilty, he student may appeal the
verdict or withdraw from the
University. If the student does
neither, the student is dismissed
from the University.

I would prefer (2). For others
among you, I suspect that (1) is

True to the Intention of the
Framers, who wanted to avoid
having to note on transcripts that
students were “Dismissed” from
the -University if at all possible. I
happen to consider this to be
disingenuous, however. The
student is being dismissed. They
just don’t want to say that,

However, what the White
Book has right now, it seems, is
the following procedure:

(3) If the student is found
guilty, the student may appeal the
verdict or withdraw from the
University. If the student does
neither, the student is deemed to

have withdrawn from the
University.

As I said, this incorporates the
following:

(3*) If the student is found
guilty, the student may withdraw
from the University. If the student
does not, the student is deemed to
have withdrawn from the
University. ~

The problem may be, in the
end, a problem with the verb
“withdraw”. I can withdraw
myself, or I can be withdrawn by
others. Under the White Book, it
seems, I always withdraw myself.
Even when others withdraw me.

Night
on the
town

By Kate Shellnutt

STAFF WRITER

The Gender Relations
Committee claimed “Dating is
Backl” as it promoted its second
Date Night on Thursday,
November 10. The GRC sold far
fewer vouchers for dinners at
local favorites the Sheridan
Livery, Wilson Walker House, and
Sweet Things, despite the event’s
success during Spring Term, when
overmany more people
participated.

“It seemed like everybody went
last year,” said sophomore Jessica
Hopper. “I don’t know anyone
who went this time. I didn’t even
hear about it until this week.”

Though the organization put up
“lots of advertising around
campus and around town,”
according to junior GRC member
Jean Rose Clawater, their publicity
was not enough to convince
students to ditch the books for a
date.

“It was kinda a busy night.
People have work and don’t really
plan on going out on a Thursday,”
said sophomore Jenny Sproul.

Courtney Fitzgerald, senior
and GRC co-chair, planned the
event to make casual dating and
sober interactions between men
and women more prevalent on
campus. She saw Date Night as
providing the opportunity for
W&L students to go out “on an
old-fashioned date.”

“The dating scene here, and at
most other colleges, is very
different from what our parents
and grandparents experienced. We
wanted to bring back dating so that
students would realize that there
are other ways to hang out with
someone of the opposite sex other
than at a party,” said Fitzgerald.

In addition to the ten—dollar
dinner vouchers the GRC sold by
cash, check or swipe, last week’s
event included. a free acoustic
concert in the candlelit Commons
living room, music courtesy of
senior Wheeler Sparks, junior
Blair Crunk, and senior Chris
Kimmel. ‘

“We should have more stuff
like this,” said sophomore Emily
Wolff, who caught the acoustic

‘concert by accident.

Unfortunately, few took
advantage of the dinner vouchers
or the concert opportunity.

“I was planning on going, but
I didn’t get a date,” said
sophomore Abinav Kapur. “ A
bunch of people I talked to were

While students are rarely roused from the comfort of the frat
basement, SAO’s Casino Night featuring an IM Texas Hold’em
Tournament appealed to the gamblers on campus.
Daring students were willing
to try their luck and show

off their skills.

STAFF WRITER

Victory cries filled the
Marketplace on Wednesday
evening as competitors huddled
together, cards in hand. Disguised
cafeteria tables were draped with
green poker cloths, and music
serenaded students as they
munched on chips and sipped
sodas. Together, the Intramural
committee and the Student
Activities Organization hosted the
first combined Casino Night and
Texas Hold’em tournament.

Though this event was an
attempt to unite IIVI and SAO, the
Hold’em tournament had a much
larger draw. Casino dealer
freshman Jeremy Wainwright said
he thought the Casino Night
would have been much more
popular had it not major
competition from the
tournament. Also,
there were many
f r a t e r n i t y
p a r t i e s
occurring at the
same time.

“We have
many frat guys that
show up,” assistant
casino coordinator
senior Ian Dickinson
said. “We wish we had
more. It’s all a factor of
time, when in the term it is,
and how well it is advertised.”
According to SAO recreation
chair and casino coordinator H.J.
Lee, these organizations aim to
provide students with a sober
environment to socialize and
compete in. Instead of making the
tiring trek to the country, this event
was located conveniently on
campus, easily accessible to
everyone.

“I enjoy it because I get to see

ealing

Casino Night draws students willing to risk it all By Jessica snaw

freshmen and meet new people,”
Lee said. “It’s another way of
meeting people without alcohol.”

SAO sent out a campus notice
advertising spots for poker
dealers. It offered a wage of $40
for three hours, and divided the
students into black jack and
roulette dealers. The four dealers
present were freshman Jeremy
Wainwright, senior Christina
Snowden, freshman Chris Rucker,
and freshman Mike Yan. No
previous experience was required,
but a basic knowledge of the rules
was necessary.

Rucker, Wainwright, and Yan
said their motivation was the
generous paycheck. But, Rucker
claimed he would have
participated regardless of his
dealer position.

“I have friends in SAO,” he
said. “I like to eat, drink, and
converse in brotherly fellowship.”

SAO operates from a budget
from the Executive Committee
and membership fees. This money
was split for pay for the dealers
and the DJ, rent for the supplies,
refreshments, and prizes. The
committee buys the chips too,
even though the students don’t use
real money to play. The SAO
ofﬁcers have weekly meetings to
plan the student events. So far,
attendance has been ﬂuctuating.

“It really varies,” Dickinson
said. “We’re still trying to ﬁgure
out what is the best combination.
We have some things that a lot of
people come to, and some things
where there are just a couple of
friends. We start to see more each
time which is a positive trend.”

Some students attend because
of convenience, and others for the
quality entertainment.

“In comparison, this is hands
down better than frat parties,”
freshman Liza Njuguna said.

“I enjoy it because I get to see freshman
and meet new people. It’s another way of

meeting people without alcohol.”

SAO RECREATION CHAIR

Lex hosts international directors

Filmmakers from all over the world come to Lexington to debut their films

By Audrey Fell

STAFF WRITER

WorldFest once again visits
Lexington, giving students the
opportunity to learn more about
the film industry. Hosting 16
different directors over the week-
end of November 3"‘, WorldFest
sought to give students a differ-
ent perspective on ﬁlm produc-
tion and screenwriting.

Based out of Houston, Texas,
WorldFest is led by Hunter Todd,
the Chairman and Founding Di-
rector. It is the third oldest in-
ternational film festival in the
county and has discovered fa-
mous directors such as Steven
Spielberg, Ang Lee, the Cohen
brothers, and Rildley Scott.

“This ﬁlm festival is an hon-
ors film festival. That means

only the best of the best are
here,” said Todd. The genres of
ﬁlm vary greatly, from art house
thrillers to conservative docu-
mentaries regarding the Iraq war.

This past weekend, the ﬁlm
festival was hosted in Lexington,
under the personal sponsorship
of John Dean, a Washington and
Lee alumni from the class of
1976.

After seeing the Beatles’
movie “Help”, Dean’s eyes were
open to an entirely different
genre of ﬁlm. From that point on,
Dean aspired to take part in the
ﬁlm industry.

The 16 film directors come
from all parts of the world, in-
cluding 8 different countries.
The directors also vary in age
and experience in ﬁlm creation.
The director’s inspirations for
creating the ﬁlms vary with some
based on personal experience,
some dance, and others on visual
aspects of the landscape por-
trayed in the ﬁlm.

On writing his screenplay,
Flaman found it difﬁcult to ﬁnd
sufficient help to critique his
work. “You can’t have family or
friends critique your work, you
have to find someone that
doesn’t care at all about what you

are writing to get the best re-
view.”

The scenery in Juliet
McKoen’s ﬁhn “Frozen” was the
center for the plot. She based her
script around a lake, which stood
as a symbol throughout the ﬁlm.
“My ﬁlm is thematically inspect-
ing the boundaries between per-
ception and reality.”

Short ﬁlms were also a very
big feature at Worldfest—Lexing-
ton. Each of the short ﬁlms fo-
cused on different types of cin-
ematography; some were car-
toons and others short dramas.

Liz Milwe’s short ﬁlm,“The
Wedding” captures the wedding
between two people through two
different types of dance. “I
wanted to capture my work on
film, because stories and actions
continue to move on through
ﬁlm, rather than being lost for-
ever in a theater production.”
Having worked as a choreogra-
pher, the film gave Milwe the
opportunity to share her art to
more people than would in the
theater.

“Cat’s Bad Hair Day” was
another short film by Debby
Wolfe, a recent graduate of Uni-
versity of Central Florida Film
Program. She used this ﬁlm as
her graduation ﬁlm at the univer-
sity. “The story is a con1ing—of—
age story which is based on my
personal experiences. It realis-
tically shows how young girls
deal with their changes.” In or-
der to ﬁnd the sets for this ﬁlm,
Wolfe took over a middle school
in Orlando as well as went door
to door asking people permission
to use their houses.

The ﬁlms presented gave stu-
dents a large feel for the differ-
ent ways to use their creativity
in new ways. Before kicking off
the festival, John Dean shared his
underlying motive for the ﬁlm
festival. “Through the ﬁlm festi-
val, I hope to show students that
there are other ways to become
successful] aside from being in-
vestment bankers or lawyers.
Finding success is something you
are passionate with is the great-
est way to live your life.”

sure the reputation of male and

said that she had embraced the
feminist movement less before
she came here. “W&L has
radicalized me, hell yeah,” she
said.

One of the reasons that femi-
nists tend to get a bad rap is that
gender relations on campus are
poor

“Men and women are almost
entirely separate. Their only in-
teraction is on the dance ﬂoor
or at a party where alcohol is in-
volved and men are literally
trawling for women. Students
are forced to objectify members
of the opposite sex,” said sopho-
more Dane Boston.

Another related issue is the
double standard used to mea-

more than ﬁfty people. Those
in attendance included represen-
tatives from all sectors of the
Lexington community, including
professors, fraternity men, VMI
students, and people from the
town. The discussion was mod-
erated by Dean Ellen Mayock.

At the beginning, Dean
Mayock asked everyone who
considered themselves to be
feminists to raise their hands.
Many did, but some did not.

People felt hesitant to raise
their hands since feminism has a
negative connotation, especially
on this campus. Freshman Grace
Andrews said, “You feel that if
you call yourself a feminist, you
have to ﬁt the mold- you have to
be angry and belligerent.”

Others refused to identify
themselves with what they felt
was just another label. Sopho-
more Yvonne Coker said “I don’t
call myself a feminist, because
feminism is another label, and it
becomes a cookie cutter. It is an
approach, an outlook on life, I
don’t use a word.”

women their reproductive
rights,” she said.

This point was heavily de-
bated, since many of the people
present considered themselves
to be supporters of women's
rights, while opposing abortion.

The forum then progressed to

College years hold big deci-
sions for everyone, but for W&L
women, these decisions are es-
pecially difficult and 1ife-chang-
ing. Every woman on this cam-
pus is capable of making her own
way in the world and engaging
in a lucrative and prestigious ca-
reen

Yet many are torn. The tug
of maternal instincts and the tick
of the biological clock contend
with the pull of success and the
pressure to make money.

As difficult as this decision is,
what women really want is the
ability to make that choice for
themselves and for society to re-
spect and support them in what-
ever path they decide to pursue.
At the most basic level, feminism
stands for choice and respect.

In order to increase awareness
and begin productive dialogue,
sophomore Jessica Hopper orga-
nized a Feminist Forum to dis-
cuss topics relevant to the W&L
community. Hopper worked this
summer as an intern at the

' Rockbridge chapter of the Na-
tional Organization for Women.

“This was necessary to do
because of the gender relations
problem and because thought
here is so homogeneous,” she
said.

campus. Those who espouse
feminist thought are sometimes
viewed as militant and man—hat-

The forum addressed what
feminism really meant. Sopho-
more Andrew Rothey said,
“Feminism is all about choice.
You can be a feminist home-
maker. You can be a feminist
CEO. You can choose where you
put your talents.”

Professor Domnica
Radulescu believed that femi-
nism had a stricter definition.
“You cannot call yourself a femi-
nist if you deny women her right
to choose. It is a characteristic
of dictatorial societies to deny

Some feel that another word
describes their views better.
“People accept the word equali-
tarian more readily,” said sopho-
more Dominique Lamb.

Professor Robin LeB1anc ex-
pressed disappointment that the
word should have to be used at
all. “I shouldn’t have to use a
special word for the rights ev-
eryone should have regardless of
whether or not they have a pc-
nis,” she said.

The difficulty with deciding
whether or not to label oneself a
feminist stems from an ambiva-
lent deﬁnition of the word. Al-
though feminism literally means
advocacy for rights for women,
the word often has a negative

TALKBACKS

Do you think that the
upcoming Colonnade
renovations are
warranted?

 

Tim Smith, alumni ‘o4 '
“The buildings should, at some
point, be gutted and completely

, modernized for the sake of

keeping up with technology.
But as for the facade, it should
never be touched.”

 

C.J. Joseph-Guevara,
freshman ‘
“The colonnade does need to

be accessible to the handi-
capped, and when a student
gets injured it is a pretty big
hassle to climb four ﬂights of
stairs to get to class. Overall, I
do agree it is something that
needs to be done.”

    
  

Craig Malkmes, freshman
“No, we should not renovate
the Colonnade. Not only is it a
national landmark, the Colon-
nade deﬁnes W&L. It is so
unique and it really captures
the character of the school.”

 
   

. .  vs

Kate Norby, senior
“I think that the only renova-
tions that should be done are to
preserve, like painting or ﬁxing
the foundation. If there were to
be any cosmetic renovations, or
a complete overhaul of a par-
ticular building, I can assure
you that that will not go over
well with alumni or current stu-
dents.”

Adam Kowaisky, junior
“I really like the fact that all
the buildings look alike on the
outside but are vastly different
on the inside. It makes them
look uniform but still gives
them personality. I can see that
the buildings need some work,
but if renovations do take place
I think it would be very impor-
tant to maintain that element of
each building’s uniqueness and
individuality.”

This week’s Talkbacks was

conducted by Ashley Cooning.

I have no problem with rela-
tionships, in fact, I am much hap-
pier with my life when involved
with a special someone.

However, the prospect of
finding an awesome chick that
digs me at our school is a fright-
ening scenario.

Ideally I would like to push
marriage until my late 20’s so I
can let my hormones settle be-
fore I am forced to only have sex
with one person for the rest of
my life.

I know that if I marry within
the next ﬁve years, the marriage
will last about as long as Gigli
did in theatres.

Recently I attended a meeting
on feminism in order to gain a
broader and less narrow—rninded
perspective on the women in our
school, and women in general.

Actually, I said that to make
myself sound like a caring per-
son.

I attended because I find it
extremely entertaining when
women talk about their intense
hatred for men.

I expected to walk into a
scene of crazed activists com-
plaining about the degradation
they routinely face due to the evil
stereotypical male.

In spite of the previous sar-
casm, I will admit that I was en-
lightened and my definition of
feminism changed dramatically.

Apparently the modern femi-
nist does not concern themselves
with hating men (I admit I was a
tad disappointed).

Feminism has evolved to long
for more than equality with the
opposite sex.

The contemporary feminist,
as I comprehended after listen-
ing to the consensus of opinions,
desires the right to choose their
path.

l’d delve more into the intri-
cacies of feminism, but that
would be comparable to attempt-
ing to describe the, details of Wilt
Chamber1ain’s love life (he slept
with an estimated 20,000
women).

Women who would rather wed than work are on to something

@ TOYOTA

The modern woman at W&L
should strive for high—paying
jobs, but the appeal of the M.R.S.
Degree still seems appealing to
many girls at our school.

Although I planned to write
an article talking about how this
sacred degree has led to a loss
of feminism on campus, I will
choose not to insult or critique
the conformists.

In other words, I consider the
people that frown upon the
M.R.S. Degree naive to the mod-
em definition of feminism.

Personally, if I meet a moti-
vated woman that revealed signs
of wanting to marry me, proved
that her dad would provide her
with a stellar job. and guaranteed
that I could relax at home all day
and play with the kids I would
definitely take the M.R. Degree.

That opportunity looks doubt-
ful so I will continue with the
attempt to deceive a fine damsel
into believing that I have a ca-
reer in something promising.

Contemporary feminists
would love to see more women
enter the workforce and pursue
wages equal to those of men

However, they also respect
the women that choose to raise
children at home.

The only problem is that a
majority of the W&L girls who
receive a M.R.S. Degree with a
minor in Business Administra-
tion will neglect to take an ac-
tive role in the feminist move-
ment.

If the M.R.S. Degree were an
actual major at our school, the
classes would be the,Elliptical
101, Stationary Bike 230, and
How to Avoid the Fro-Yo 347.

Although the hallowed degree
is measured in carats as opposed
to GPA, this conformity only
leads to loss of individuality (dif-
ferent from loss in feminism)
which is routine at this school.

Feminists should embrace the
M.R.S. Degree. Besides, any guy
stupid enough to marry at 23 will
be too oblivious to ask his
ﬁancee to sign a pre—nup.

Ladies, I encourage you
marry the right guy because the
M.R.S. Degree can bring the
riches for which you spent hours
studying.

evisiori, newspapers, maga-
radio, the Intemet. Today
are more ways than ever to
e the most up-to-date infor-
n on current events, and
students have access to all
these sources and more. Yet there
seems to be a common consensus
that these students are “living in a
bubble,” sheltered from the world
outside Lexington.

So are students sheltered from
life beyond Lexington, or do they
keep up with current events? Both
professors and students seemed to
agree that most students only keep
up with those issues that interest
them, which may not be the most
important issues on the whole,
business professor Amanda
Bower said.

Bower said that current events

cover a lot of issues, some of

which may not be the most perti-
nent stories.

“Current events are relative,”
Bower said. “You can make a
‘Tom Cruise is crazy’ joke", and
they all know what you are talk-
ing about. When the DC sniper
thing was happening, W&L stu-
dents saw white panel vans every-
where and knew it. And there are
current events about which 21-
year-old college students will be
more familiar than their
professor[s].”

Bower said that overall, her
students seem informed on many
issues, but that may be attributed
to more widespread sources, such
as advertising.

“Many of my examples in class
are marketing [and] advertising

but to a large extent that credit
goes more towards the advertisers
and marketers than to individuals

is for students to keep up with that
information  but there are cer-
tainly students in each class who

about. Others may just not pipe

H

up.

While Bower believes her stu-
dents are generally informed on
current events, journalism profes-
sor Brian Richardson said he finds
W&L students to be unaware of
newsworthy issues. When asked if
he believed students to be in-
formed on off-campus issues,
Richardson replied, “On the
whole, no.”

“There are some shining ex-
ceptions among the student body,
but most seem to have formed
concrete opinions already and
don’t seek out news that could ei-
ther inform or challenge those
opinions,” Richardson said. “In
their defense, it is true that news
media often don’t make clear what
young adults’ stake in an issue or
story might be.”

Richardson said that although
students may be up-to-date on na-
tional issues, it is important to
become more aware of local sto-
es.

“Student ignorance of sub-na-
tional government in particular is
profound and frightening,”
Richardson said. “Few can name

Tri-chairs

The 2004 Mock Convention
Trustees recently selected the
new tri-chairs for the 2008 con-
vention. Richard Friedman will
be the General Chair, Sara
Mueller the Personnel Chair, and
Wes Little the Political Chair.

Charlie Yates, one of the
convention’s trustees, explained
that “the selection process in-
volved applications last spring
and this fall, followed by [sev-
eral] rounds of interviews.” Tho-
mas Worthy ’05 and Anne Idsal
’05 joined Yates and former Gen-
eral Chair Noah Rhodes on the
selection committee. Professor
William Connelly, faculty advi-
sor to the Mock Convention,
mentioned that Worthy and Idsal
“both work this year on Capitol
Hill,” and that Rhodes “gave gen-
erously of his time as well.”

When asked how large his
role is in the planning process,
Connelly stated that most of the
planning is done by the student
tri-chairs. “Mock Convention is
part of a proud tradition of stu-
dent self-govemment at Wash-

“Faculty play a largely passive
role. I give advice when asked.
Bob De Maria has been a tremen-
dous help to the Mock Con stu-
dents over the years with his tech-
nical expertise and with promot-
ing media coverage.”

Friedman, the General Chair,
said the new tri-chairs will first
focus on committee appointments.
“The primary concern is setting up
the steering committee  which
is made up of sixteen people. We
also hope to make State Chair ap-
pointments next spring,” he an-
nounced.

When asked about national and
local media coverage, Friedman
said the team “would like to see
C-Span do gavel-to-gavel cover-
age like they did either in 1996 or
2000.” He also hopes the conven-
tion “will get standard AP wire
coverage and even a blurb on

like too see the other cable net-
works give us some coverage.”

IF C issues strikes to ﬁve fraternities

By Sarah Murray
REPORTER

 

The Inter-Fraternity Council
punished five houses last week
for alcohol-related recruitment
violations, the ﬁrst blot on a re-
cruitment season characterized
by well—behaved fraternities.

An IFC press release stated
that the fraternities had sent e-
mails to freshmen inviting them
to consume alcohol, “some-
times in a manner of over con»
sumption.” Kappa Alpha,
Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Delta
Theta, Phi Gamma Delta, and
Pi Kappa Alpha face two weeks
of social probation for the of-
fense. p

All the sanctioned‘fraterni-
ties received first strikes except
Phi Delta Theta, which is al-
ready under probation for a first
strike received last spring term.
According to Chad Thomas,
senior IFC justice, the violation

was not serious enough to war-
rant a second strike. In addition
to probation, every house will
pay a fine and attend an alco-
hol education program.’ ’
The investigations ;were
based on information submitted
to the office of the dean of stu-
dents and the office of student
activities. In keeping with the
Standards for Fraternities and
Sororities outlined in the stu-
dent handbook, the IFC prohib-

Sapra said. “{Christm_as] Week- I

Jon Philipson on competing for Oxford scholarship

By Kate Shellnutt
REPORTER

On the Friday before Thar1ks-
giving Break, senior Jon Philipson
found himself in Birmingham,
Alabama. Despite being nine
hours away from his Florida home
and days away from the turkey-
ﬁlled holiday, Philipson was feel-
ing extremely thankful.

He spent Friday and Saturday,
November 19"‘ and 20“‘ compet-
ing in the district finals for the
Rhodes Scholarship, a fellowship
which provides two years of study
at Oxford University in England.

“The whole weekend was like
an interview——the dinner, the re-
ception, and then your own little
twenty minute slot,” said
Philipson. “People were nervous,
pacing and stuff, but I was just
happy to get that far.”

Philipson first became inter-
ested in the fellowship in March,
after politics professor William
Connelly suggested he apply.

Connelly called Philipson “a
natural for a Rhodes Scholarship”
as he cited Philipson’s academic
achievements, community in-
volvement, and personable nature.

Well—roundedness is the stan-
dard for Rhodes Scholars. Selec-
tion of recipients follows the
specifications set by the scholar-
ships’ namesake, British pioneer
Cecil Rhodes: intellectual ability,
moral character, and service. Ini-
tiated at his death in 1902, they
are the oldest international fellow-
ships.

Each year, regional selection
committees choose 32 American
Rhodes Scholars. Fifteen past
scholars have come from Wash-
ington and Lee.

“Rhodes always seeks the
brightest and most socially en-
gaged students in America,” said
Dean George Bent, Associate
Dean of the College. “Many W&L
students embrace the ideals sought
after by the Rhodes Trust, and

their academic abilities
frequently put their applications at
the top of the pile.”

This year, the University en-
dorsed 12 students to apply, and
Philipson advanced to compete in
District 7, according to his home
state, Florida, but was not selected
for the fellowship.

“At first, it was overwhelming.
I mean, you never picture yourself
going for this kind of thing,” said
Philipson.

He said all of his professors
helped him apply, practice for the
interviews, and advance in the
competition, while his fraternity
brothers were “extremely support-
ive.”

“They were even sending me
emails and text messages the night
before, wishing me good luck,”
said Philipson. “It ended up be-
ing the best interview I’d ever had.
I was myself the whole weekend.”

For Philipson, being himself
means balancing hard work with
humor and relaxation.

“Jon’s ready humor, coupled
with his insight, wit, and frequent
ﬂashes of insight make him an
ideal student,” said Professor

publicity for the school, and
it also lets candidates reach out
to the younger generation of vot-
ers.”

Mueller pointed out that one
person on the steering commit-
tee is entirely responsible for
public relations.

“In the past a journalism ma-
jor has often held that job,” she
added. Little and Friedman said
newspapers from across Virginia
and even the Washington D.C.

area would probably send report-
s down to cover t e con —
tiori.

When asked how the quadren-
nial convention continues to at-
tract high profile speakers and
candidate, Connelly pointed to
the strong media poi/erage.

“The W & L Mock Conven-
tion is the most successful such
college student exercise in the
nation. Prominent speakers
spawn media attention, and in
turn media attention attracts
prominent speakers. Politicians

“Usually about 90% of the students are involved with the convention in some way,
so this is really something everyone can participate in.”

Connelly.

Philipson doesn’t take himself
too seriously, but remains con-
cerned about others. His résumé
evidences his selﬂessness: start-
ing a peer-tutoring program for at-
risk youth in high school, volun-
teering with Head Start at Waddell
Elementary, coordinating the Vol-
unteer Venture pre—orientation
trips, serving as Hillel vice presi-
dent, working with pro-bono stu-
dent consulting, and participating
in many other organizations.

While he could easily boast of
his extensive involvement,
Philipson doesn’t. He focuses on
the progress of the different orga-
nizations and the ways they ben-
eﬁt others.

“He doesn’t just do commu-
nity service projects to bulk up his
resume: he gives of his time and
his energy because he recognizes
the obligations those of us who
have been born into good fortune
have to our society at large. He
doesn’t start programs because he
thinks it will earn him praise: he
starts them because he knows
people need them,” said Dean
Bent.

  On the Rhodes again 

Philipson translates this pas-
sion for service into political am-
bitions.

“Working with people at
W&L. .. has given me the under-
standing that politics is more than
the issues, it’s the people behind
them,” said Philipson.

Philipson remains unsure of
his plans after graduation, but all
options focus around his interest
in social change through politics.

“I’m applying to some law
schools. I’ve also talked with Jim
Davis-—he’s a W&L alum—about
working with his campaign for
governor in Florida,” said
Philipson.

A self-proclaimed “future pub-
lic servant,” he hopes to promote
education and social policy as a
Florida congressman or governor
in the future.

“I fully expect to see Jon in
Congress someday. I’ll be happy
to help him advance his healthy
ambition. Jon understands that
politics is a good thing,” said Pro-
fessor Connelly, who has helped
him secure his past two summer
internships in Washington, D.C.

In the meantime, for his expe-
riences at W&L and his opportu-
nities in the future, Jon Philipson
remains thankful.

“He doesn’t just do community service projects to bulk

up his resume: he gives of his time and his energy be-

cause he recognizes the obligations those of us who have

been born into good fortune have to our society at large. ”

Christmas is in the air — the
first snow has dusted our cam-
pus, the Commons is decked
in red and green, and organi-

zations are packing all kinds.

of events into these last two
weeks. Despite all the deco-
rations, the regular activities
on campus continue. We still
have papers to write, exams to
take, parties to go to - and we
still have Wednesday Night
Live.

I can see all of your blank
faces — Wednesday Night
Live? You mean those bands
that play in the Commons?
Yes, those bands. But also the
comedy acts’ put on by stu-
dents, the laser tag on Cannan
Green, and the poker tourna-
ments. V '

Jason Rodocker, the Direc-
tor of Student Activities, con-
tinued the tradition of Uncom-
mon Grounds from last year,
but changed the name to
Wednesday Night Live to “em-
phasize the regular occurrence
of having something every

‘ Wednesday night.” The pur-
pose of the night is to give stu-
dents the chance to plan and
execute their idea for a fun
event — such as the laser tag

' and comedy nights.

‘ The problem comes in the
form of students not under-
standing what Wednesday

Night Live is. Freshman Julie
Petersen commented, “I’ve
never been ~ I don’t- know
much about it.” Sophomore
Will Chamberlain agreed, add-
ingthat he has too much to do
during the week anyway to go

' to anything.

Nevertheless, I Rodocker’
says that he has been quite
pleased with the turnout.
Some 200 studentsshowed up -
at the comedy night, which
featured sophomores Kate
Shellnutt and Kelly Harvey,
and senior Cody Gabbard. The
laser tag night was also a huge
success. ,

When asked about the draw
of off campus events, such as
Christmas in the Country,
Rodocker commented that he
believes that they draw no
more students away from
Wednesday Night Live than
studying or other organization
commitments do.

Rodocker hopes students
are able to experience all parts
of the college experience, but
in a balanced manner.

He hopes that more stu-
dents will continue to plan
their own events because that
is the purpose of Wednesday
Night Live and those are the
events that draw the most stu-
dents. Events arealways free
to students and convenient for
those on campus. Junior
Meghan loss‘ said, i“ I try to go
when possible...it’s easy to
stop by as a study break.” .

erry holidays

Other winter celebrations should take a back seat to Christmas

By Tim Livingston
STAFF WRITER

As a Jewish student, I demand
an explanation as to the lack of
Hanukkah ornaments on campus.

Also, my African American
friends would appreciate some
more Kwanzaa decorations.
Lastly, a few Ramadan pamphlets
would also be prudent.

How can people make these
claims with a straight face? The
transformation from the “Christ-
mas” season of my youth to the
current “Ho1iday" season has been
an arduous road.

Actually the conversion hasn’t
encountered many roadblocks be-
cause the desire to constantly con-
form to the laws of political cor-
rectness has torn down all barri-
ers in the way of ostracizing any
holidays during the month of De-
cember.

Perhaps this overwhelming
personal statistic will help people
comprehend the humor within

America’s latest trend of not leav-
ing out any religions during this
present—filled month.

When I graduated from el-
ementary school in 1997, four out
of the six songs we. sang at the
Holiday show were Christmas
songs.

When my brother graduated
from grade school only six years
later, they sung four songs and
only one was about Christmas.
This is undeniably startling.

When asked a family member
in the audience commented, “The
Ramadan song was quite interest-
ing.”

Ah yes, who would ever for-
get those beautiful Ramadan
songs playing on the radio when
the Holiday season rolled around?

I mean no offense to Muslim
readers, in fact I would argue that
Ramadan (although I know little
about it) deserves more decora-
tions than Hanukkah or Kwanzaa.

Well maybe that’s an overstate-
ment, but considering Hanukkah
is probably the third most impor-

tant holiday in the Jewish religion,
and Kwanzaa was created in Cali-
fornia in the l960’s', I would ar-
gue that neither one of these cel-
ebrations deserve a song at el-
ementary school concerts.

On second thought, I ’m al-

ways game for a little “Dreidel
Dreidel.” But that’s it.

Considering that most people
in this country deem themselves
Christians, and Christmas is the
paramount holiday in the religion,
it should be understood why the
festivity is entitled to more atten-
tion.

There is nothing to explain the
distraught of people in the coun-
trywho strive to see a Menorah
for every Christmas tree or a
Ramadan song for every Christ-
mas song.

These ideas attempt to equal-
ize, but the audience is primarily
Christian.

What ever happened to at-
tempting to appeal to the majority
audience?

There is a reason why

Milwaukee’s Best doesn’t adver-
tise on the Home Shopping Net-
work.

The need to be perceived as
politically correct is not always
detrimental, but this time of the
year should be dedicated to only
one holiday.

Although every religion’s holi-
day has its validity, people need
to realize Christmas’ dominance in
December.

Whether Christian, Jewish,
Muslim or other, let’s all join
hands, celebrate the holidays, and
not fret about Holiday trimmings.

It’s vi-tal to remember that some
point long after Jesus’ death,
somebody made—up that Christ
was born on December 25th.

Although there is only a l/
364.25 chance this is correct, I
refuse to question details at this
time.

Instead, I ask all religions to
simply forget about your holiday
because Christmas is definitely
better.

Alito’s politics

Bush’s newest pick for Supreme Court should please both the right and the left

By Caley Anderson
COLUMNIST

My more liberal friends doth
protest too much the nomination
of Samuel Alito, who is quite
probably the next Supreme Court
Associate Justice.

While I personally side with
the social liberalism espoused by
many opponent’s of Alito’s nomi-
nation on issues such as abortion,
gun control, what have you, I dif-
fer from them in thinking that
Alito will interfere with precedent
on such issues.

Both sides rightly condemn
judicial “activism," the concept of
the judiciary establishing law
through creative interpretations of
legislative acts, often in deﬁance

of precedent and of existing inter-
pretations of law.

The problem with radically re-
interpreted law is that it creates,
in one Justice’s words, a “jurispru-
dence of doubt,” a situation where
the law shifts so rapidly that it’s
hard to determine just what is or
is. not legal or illegal.

There is, of course, some room
to read the law and the Constitu-
tion through aparticular lens, as
hardcore constructionist readings
of law are (despite what Antonin
Scalia says) impossible. Never-
theless, out and out Reconstruc-
tions of the law are unacceptable.

Usually this gets turned into a
conservative argument. Republi-
cans very often argue that the ma-
jority-liberal judiciary attempts to
circumvent America’s “true val-

ues” by reinterpreting the law to
their own ends. They give as ex-
amples the ideas expressed by the
9"‘ Circuit Court, along with other
courts that have handed down lib-
eral opinions.

There is some merit to their ar-
guments, though they often over-
extend their criticisms— most of the
decisions they point to are quite
well-decided. Often conserva-

tives are criticizing the politics of
decisions rather than their legal
foundations, which are invariably
quite strong.

Similarly, some liberals are
overextending their criticisms of
Alito. Their evidence for his po-
tential activism (principally, they
fear, against abortion), are memos
and other documents he wrote for
the Reagan administration which

showed vehemence on behalf of
very conservative positions on
social issues, including abortion.
They believe that he still carries
these beliefs and will use his spot
on the Court’s bench to legislate
against abortion, et. al.

Whether or not he even does
still carry these beliefs is in ques-
tion. People, especially conserva-
tives, tended to get very, very car-
ried away during the Reagan era,
and I have a feeling that Alito was
one of the individuals swept away
in the nonsense tide of extreme
conservatism. He is likely far
more moderate today.

And more importantly, even if
he is still socially reactionary, he
is not going to let his positions
interfere with his jurisprudence.
Like Scalia, and like Roberts, he
is a good judge who takes the law
as the basis of his decisions. He

please

may not be, as I had hoped, as po-
litically moderate as O’Connor,
but he is fair and as partial a nomi-
nee as one could possibly hope for
from President Bush. \
Instead of criticizing Alito,
moderates ought to be thanking
their lucky stars that some of they

REALLY activist conservatives,

weren't nominated. Some of the
names on the short list weren’t
even real judges— Orrin Hatch was
mentioned as a name, and (shud-
der) John Ashcroft was also ru-
mored to be a possibility. And we
all know what happened to Harriet
Miers.

Alito may be conservative, but
that doesn’t matter because he’s a
good judge. Politics plays a fringe
role on the bench, what really
matters is one’s understanding of
the law, and Alito has a very good
one indeed.

Abortion is ugly

Abortion is a stain on America’s history and integrity

By Jack Staunton
C0 LU MNIST

When one is convinced that a
massive injustice is at hand, when
one is convinced that an inherent
wrong currently occupies a
comfortable spot in our society,

times of slavery, and such was the
case during the times of the Civil
Rights Era. The stain upon the
integrity of America is apparent
enough from the fact that these
human rights abuses were allowed
to happen at all. This stain is made
even worse by the length of time
that it took Americans to raise their
heads and lift their voices to cry
out that bigotry will not be the
status quo, and that hate in any
form, but especially when
protected by law, is something
entirely unacceptable to our sense
of justice.

Let the cry of Malcolm X carry
through to the present-day. “It is
not a ﬁght for civil rights, it is a
ﬁght for human rights.” When has
this been more true than when
seven out of nine lawyers sitting

on a bench in Washington D.C. in
1973 decided that a small human
looking object with fingers and
toes, with an independent heart
that begins to beat by day twenty-
four after its conception, with an
organ system in place by week
eight, and with the ability to feel

resemble a human and is therefore
afforded no protection? For even
if one does not believe that small
human-looking object to be in fact
human, it is undeniable that one
day that “fetus” will take its first
breath upon emerging from the
womb, that it will let loose its first
cry, and that it will giggle its first
giggle.

This ability, this fundamental
right that is something we refer to
as life, has been denied to forty-
six million human beings, and is
being denied to one and a half
million more as each year passes.

This is an absolute atrocity and it-

is far past time that we do
something about it.

Forty-six million. Do not let
that number just pass you by. Do
not let yourself become

desensitized to it. A fourth of our
generation has been killed by
abortion. As Dr. Ely, the author
of “Israel on the Appomattox: A
Southern Experiment in Black
Freedom from the 1790s Through
the Civil War,” stated, “If the
horrors of the 20th century taught

Why is it that we now seem to be
moving backwards in our ﬁght for
human rights? Instead of ﬁghting
to further define the meaning of
human equality, we are now
fighting to define the value of
human life.

We have let our voices lay
silent for far too long. May God
have mercy on us that we have let
this horror go on for so long with
so little protest in return. We
speak of integrity, we speak of
dignity, we speak of honor. Well
then let us show that these virtues
actually mean something to us by
speaking out in defense of that
most intrinsic of all human rights’,
the right to live. When speaking
out in defense of life, your voice
shall be forty—six million strong.
Let it be heard.

Feeling the rush"

socializing with members of the Kappa ‘Alpha Order last Tuesday, freshman Hobson Bryan may have found his new brothers.

Despite increasing costs, a huge time commitment and that email scandal,

Fraternities and sororities
completed another successful
rush this weekend. But at what
cost?

As the week wore on, class
attendance waned, which some
attributed to the high time com-
mitment required by Greek or-
ganizations.

Panhellenic Advisor Kristen
Powell said, “What most
women talk about negatively are
the recruitment workshops.”

“The agenda for after recruit- '

ment [will decide] what are un-
necessary frills that don’t add
genuine interaction,” Powell
said.

Powell said that the skits put
on by the women last Tuesday
may also be cut from the pro-
gram. _

“If you have to have a skit to
have somebody join your soror-
ity, you’re in a pretty bad state,”
she said, suggesting the skits be
perfomied after recruitment for
philanthropic activity.

The added cost of lunch puts
more stress on the sorority
woman’s purse.

“I think it can be expensive,”
Powell said of the rush dates,
which are not covered by soror-
ity dues which can range from
$3028 to $9115 yearly.

Freshmen women invited on
dates are also subject to the costs
of rush. According to the 2006
Panhellenic recruitment book,
“A member of a sorority may not
buy anything for a potential
member.”

Going on rush dates can add
up, “especially for the women
who are invited out once or
twice a week,” Powell said, “but
not all of the women know that
many upperclassmen.”

Does the cost of rush leave
some women out? No, accord-
ing to Powell.

“The W&L demographics
show that usually that’s not a
problem,” she said. “78% of
women [at W&L] continue to be

’ Greek.”

Not without sacrifice, as
Powell points out. For many stu-
dents, “that money is their sum-
mer job money,” she said.

Five fraternities faced a
small rush crisis Christmas
weekend, when they were sanc-
tioned by the InterFraternity
Council (IFC) for inviting fresh-
man to “consume alcohol,
sometimes in a manner of over
consumption,” according to the
IFC press release.

The organizations came un- ~

der fire when an anonymous
whistleblower left copies of
email invitations to rush events
on IFC Advisor Jason
Rodocker’s and Dean Watkins’s

desks.

Though the IFC determined
they would not cancel Christ-
mas weekend, they placed the
fraternities on social probation
for the last weekend of recruit-
ment.

According to the report, “Re-
cruitment of members into the
Greek system should not be fo-
cused around the consumption
of alcohol.”

Rodocker said, “In my opin-
ion, [alcohol-related activities
are] not the best way to make
life-long brotherhood.”

He suggested “meaningful
conversations” as an alternative,
saying that “each house should
have some idea of the values
they want,” and try to find that

  

in freshmen.

“Doing the dinners is per-
fect,” he said. “You can take the
guys out without getting them
drunk on the bus.”

Some fraternity men blame
the social obligation to include
alcohol.

Andrew Rothey, sophomore,
said, “The reality of the situa-
tion is that right now, if any of
the houses are giving away al-
cohol, they are going to have an
advantage [during rush].”

Rodocker said, “I think they
[the fraternities] have the per-
ception that there’s no other
way. I just want to make sure
they look at their possibilities.”

Rothey said, “I think it
would be difficult, in the current

Simon (left, with buddy Chris Sherwin) at a rush dinner.

 

the rush goes on

climate, to have a successful
rush without alcohol,” but
added, “It’s not necessary,”
pointing out the rush dinners as
a successful alternative. “We
have lots of rush events that are
dry.”

Rodocker said that other
schools nationwide use such
activities as “outing club trips,
road trips, and sporting events”
as rush tools, outside of parties.

For the men, whose rush-
date costs are covered by the fra-
ternity, time management is also
a problem.

Rodocker said, “The role that
Greek life should play is to be a
complement to the university.”

Rodocker said that the orga-
nizations try to “provide. . .skills
in networking, communication,
teamwork, and time manage-
ment. They can achieve [these
goals], and sometimes they do.
Our goal is to make ‘sometimes’
more frequent.”

I But often, Greek activities
take precedent over other com-
mitments, such as homework,
athletics, or other extracurricu-
lar activities.

Kyle Simon, freshman, said,
“It takes time to go to all the
houses and meet all the guys.”

Alex Skotnicki, sophomore,
said the sacrifice is worthwhile.
“It’s all worth it in the end,” he
said. “It’s all about the
endgame.”

High school rower teams up with Shinoﬁeld to revive program

By Jessica Shaw
STAFF WRITER

When W&L joined Division
III, the [school could no longer
support a rowing program. After
the sport ﬁzzled, there have been
a few unsuccessful attempts to
revive it. Recently, sophomore
Parker Sheppard, a highly
sought—after rower in high
school, decided to bring it back
to this campus.

‘‘I have put in a budget
proposal to the EC, and we

should have our hearing in the
next few weeks,” he said.
“We’ve even gotten a few boats
lined up to purchase from other
clubs.”

Service Learning
Coordinator Aubrey Shinoﬁeld
is helping Sheppard as he tries
to build up the program. If he is
successful, she said she is
considering a coaching position,
time permitting. Shinofield,
herself, was a national rowing
champion her senior year at
Princeton. After college, she

interned as a coach at Princeton
and then coached the crew teams
at University of New Hampshire,
Harvard, and the University of
Minnesota.

“Rowing is a very intense
sport, and it can be a big
commitment, especially for a
club team,” Shinoﬁeld said. “It
is a time commitment, an
individual commitment to work
hard and be as fit and as strong
as possible, and it is also a
commitment to your
teammates.”

Student restartsdefunct rowing program

According to Sheppard, the
team plans to start training in
Lake Robertson, then transition
to the Maury River after the
athletes have some experience.
There are currently thirty people
on the e—mail list that are
interested in joining the team.

“Since most people don’t
have any rowing experience
prior to college, a start-up
program such as this one could,
with some work, develop into a
strong one in a few years,”

, Sheppard said.

Crew depends solely upon the
unification of the team.
V “If a team is not working well

together, the boat will go
nowhere, and it will be a pretty
miserable row,” Shinoﬁeld said.

If the sport gets backed
financially and the interest
remains high, it will likely get
approved as a club sport on
campus. .

“There are so many lessons to
be learned from rowing, on and
off the water,” Shinoﬁeld said.
“The only way to row well and
to go fast is if everyone in the
boat is completely in sync,
mentally and physically.
Figuring out how to do this is
challenging but extremely
fulfilling.”

Athletes

  dominate  
dodgeball  

’ Rugby and track combine for victory

By Rosemary Boyle
STAFF WRITER

Although the 2nd An-
‘ nual Dodgeball Tourna-
ment did not draw as large
of a crowd as it did last
year, no one would have
guessed that the players
were not in front of a
packed stadium from how
intensely they dodged,
ducked, dipped, dove and
dodged.

At one point, freshman
Addison Sanford was left to
fend off ﬁve hulking play-
ers from team, “The
Lodge,” and was able to
eliminate two before his fi-
nal downfall. His end,
however, did not come eas-
ily to his opponents. Ac-
cording to Sanford, he has
been practicing for quite
some time now. “I lift in the
morning and have been fo-
cusing on improving my
ninja-like dodging skills,”
he said. This particularly
challenging moment of the
night “was tough,” said

, Sanford.
The Lodge, champions

of the first round, also

dominated in the second
and semiﬁnal round. Fight-
ing to win the champion-

ship, they faced a team I

which consisted of both
track and rugby players; a
combination which turned
out to be winning too
strong for them.

After one win for The‘

Lodge, the track and rugby
stars came back strong by
winning two in a row and
taking the match. The vic-
tory celebration included
“going to Dominos!” said
the team.

According to Will
Patterson, Campus Recre-
ation Coordinator, the
Dodgebali tournament
started last year as a result
of a need for “freshmen to
have something fun to do
the first week of winter
term.” The tradition contin-
ues, providing a great op-
portunity for what the In-
tramural Catalog describes
as a chance to “throw
something at that annoying
kid in class... to let out
some of that aggression.”

“Let out some of that aggression. ”

  Fightirig for her life

Well—loved Director of Student Aﬁairs Ann Tomlinson struggles against cancer

She thought it was her gallbladder. During a

summer camping trip, she began to feel discom-

fort under her ribcage, and diagnosed herself,

vowing to go to the doctor when she and her hus-

band got home. The doctors told her differently.

Her gallbladder was ﬁne, but the CT scan

showed a mass on her ovary. In July of this year,

they diagnosed her with Stage III ovarian cancer.

By Steph Wiechmann
STAFF WRITER

Ann Tomlinson, AdrI1inistra-
tive Assistant to Student Affairs,
didn’t believe it at first. Her fa-
ther had survived colon cancer,
but there was no history of ova-
rian cancer on either side of her
family. But, the following
Wednesday, she was wheeled off
to surgery, where surgeons “de-
bulked” the mass and performed
a total hysterectomy. Then, they
put on a chemotherapy schedule.

“My mom cried,” said

Tomlinson when she informed,

her family. “My husband cried.”
Her two sons, Andrew and Chris-
topher, both juniors at
Bridgewater College, have not
comprehended it yet, she feels.

Her bosses, Dean Dave
Leonard and Dean Tammy
Futrell, took it hard. And, it was
their job to tell the student Resi-
dence Life Staff when they re-
turned in August.

“The students have been won-
derful,” Tomlinson said. In fact,
when they learned of her diag-
nosis, 35 of them showed up in

her living room with a sheet cake
and balloons.

Tomlinson has had to cutback
her hours at work to accommo-
date her chemotherapy schedule
and side effects of the treatment,
but so counts herself as pretty
lucky. '

“I’ve lost most of my hair,”
she says, reminding me of the
gray head—wrap she wears, “and
I recently have had a few intesti-
nal problems.” But, so far, she
said, that’s it.

She is thankful that the treat-
ments don’t leave her as tired as
they do most patients. “They

usually give me a rush,” she
adds.

Her appetite, too, has not
been affected. “I could eat that
paper,” she jokes, pointing to my
notebook. “If you seasoned it
up.” Going into December, this
is a good thing, since Christmas
is one of her favorite holidays.

One experience at the begin-
ning of her treatment stands, to
her, as an inspiration of how to
deal with this diagnosis.

Tomlinson, during her pre-
surgery prep, was waiting for a
chest x—ray in a Roanoke hospi-
tal this summer. An elderly
woman, in a matching hospital
gown, came in and sat down in
the waiting room. She asked
Tomlinson a question, then be-
gan to explain what she was hav-
ing done that day.

Tomlinson thought, “Oh no, I
don’t know her from Adam, and
now she’s going to sit here and
tell me everything that is wrong.”

The woman explained her
current situation, mentioned that
she was 80-years—old, and then
said, “I had ovarian cancer.”
Tomlinson was shocked, but
didn’t say a word. The woman,

“If _you let it, it will

consume y0I/l C0111-

pletely. You may not

have but two or three
years left, but you

make the most of it. ”

who had been diagnosed with the
disease 25 years ago, began to
talk about her diagnosis, her sur-
gery, her chemotherapy, and her
recovery.

After finishing, the woman
looked at Tomlinson and asked,
“What are you here for?”

Tomlinson answered, “I was
just diagnosed with ovarian can-
cer.”

“You’ll be ﬁne,” the woman
said immediately. “Don’t listen
to a word they have to say. You’ll
be just fine.”

The nurse then called the
woman’s name, and she got up
and left the room. Tomlinson
never saw her again.

“That woman was put there
for a reason,” Tomlinson tells me
with a look of absolute faith on
her face.

Speaking with her, her upbeat
attitude may surprise some.
Stage III cancer is one stage
away from being considered
“terminal,” and yet, Tomlinson is
determined to beat this.

“If you let it, it will consume
you completely,” she said. “You
may not have but two or three
years left, but you make the most
of it. I may survive it, but I’ll
always have it in the back of my
mind.”

She has just ﬁnished her fifth
chemo treatment out of eight
planned sessions, and does not
intend to stop living just because
of the diagnosis.

“I know it happened for a rea-

' son,” Tomlinson says with con-

viction. “I’m not sure yet what
that reason is, but I think it was
to get my attention. Listen to
people. Be appreciative.”

THE RING-TUM PHI ' 3

  DIIIIOIIS

 

 

edﬂoﬁal
Mission? not impossible

The Phi staﬁ makes a new version of a I09-year—old paper

The Phi has not always been
something to be proud of.

Don’t get us wrong: a century
of tradition makes for automatic
prestige and a certain amount of
recognition in the liberal arts
college circles.

But we plan to rest on our
laurels no more.

A reputation for fouled—up
stories led to a near—lockdown
between the Phi and anyone
worth speaking to on campus. A
long history of extreme stress and
severe disorganization led to a
high turnoverrate for staff

members. A lack of commitment
led to a series of bumt-out editors
and worthless clips for would—be
joumalists.

Observing this, the Phi, with
our new editor—in-chief, has made
a new year’s resolution to
improve.

Our first step is to give the
paper an identity. We created a
new mission statement. We
considered our audience and how
we want to reach you. We thought
about what we want to achieve
during our time here on staff. We
thought about continuity and

tradition. We thought about real
journalism.

This is what we came up with:

The mission of the Ring—Tum
Phi is to accurately, truthfully,
and thoroughly report news
affecting the Washington and Lee
community for students, faculty,
parents and alumni. Our goal is
to look deeper into news affecting
campus life and hold leaders
accountable. Through our
reporting. we aspire to spark
discussions that ‘lead to
discovering information that
prompts change.

We invite you to join us on our
journey this year. Track our
development through the issues,
and tell us what you think. We’d
love to see more letters to the
editor, good and bad.

We are growing as an
organization, and - looking
forward to new developments,
including a website.

We are students——help us learn.
Stick with us while we turn this
paper into something we can all
be proud of.

The above editorial represents
the majority opinion ofThe Ring-
tum Phi editorial board.

very different life than my

Without a parent organization

yourself growing into an adult.

You can still have a lot of ran-
dom fun, and experience personal
growth as a Greek. I have several
friends who have found ways to
balance their involvement with a
fraternity or sorority with their

 personal and intellectual growth.

In fact, I think the use of the term
“independent” might better de-
scribe a stateof mind, rather than
one’s Greek status. You can ﬁnd
“independents” in the fraternities,
and the fraternities are very inclu-
sive in the sense that anyone can
go to their parties (including non
Greeks), This is one of the best
aspects of the Greek system here.
Despite this, there are several
advantageous features of living
outside the Greek system. The
Greek system will never force you
to question your beliefs. Most

worldviews will rarely occur.

As a Greek, you will need to
take the initiative yourself to seek
out people who will engage you
in stimulating conversations that
stretch your assumptions about the
world (which is almost impossible
to do at a party).

As an Independent, you will be ’

thrown together with people who
see the world very differently than
you do, and it will become a mat-
ter of psychological survival to
ﬁnd ways to get along with them.
Additionally, it is easier to get to
know members of the opposite sex
as friends, rather than hook-up
partners, because there is more in-
teraction in a non-party setting.
You will be forced to defend

friends to betray you. But, if'_
you treat people with honesty,
you will soon find people who
will respect you genuinely.
These people are true friends
and one of them is worth more
than a thousand sycophants.

Finally, you realize very
quickly that the world does not
revolve around you. As a
freshman, it is easy to be de-

fun life at W&L can be, but in
the end what really matters are
your friends.

Whether you join a frater-

ever sacriﬁce your meaningful

Changing a tire
Because Triple AAA won’t
always be around to help
you out, here’s a fast and
furious guide that will get
you back on the road.

Know where your tire is:
And that pesky tire iron
too. If you can’t find your A -
spare knowing how to put
it on won’t help much.

Don’t go rolling away:
Make sure the parking
break is on and put a rock
behind another wheel as
an extra precaution.

Jack up the car:

Most cars have a spot
where the jack is designed
to go. If your car doesn’t,
make sure the jack is se-
curely placed underneath
the body of the car and
not a fender.

Undo the lugnuts:
Those are the ﬁve or six
nuts holding your tire on.
Your tire iron should fit
around each one. Turn to
the left to loosen them.
Make sure you don’t lose
these; you’ll need them
later.

Switch the tires:

Now you’re ready to pull
off the old tire; slide the
new tire onto the axel in
the old one’s place. Save
the old tire. A garage may
be able to patch it up,
which will be much
cheaper than buying a new
one.

Replace the lugnuts:

Now use the tire iron to
screw the lugnuts back on, 5
securing the spare tire to
the axel. Make sure the
lugnuts are tight to your

tire doesn’t ﬂy off ten

miles down the road.

Go get a new tire:

Your spare isn’t designed
to work forever. Go to a
garage as soon as possible
and either get your old tire
repaired or pick up a new
one.

 

 

Assault rate above average  

Though data shows problems, Washington Hall believes progress is being made

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS EDITOR

One year after student health
surveys exposed that Washington
and Lee has a sexual battery and
attempted rape rate nearly twice
the national average, the admin-
istration and student health cen-
ter released updated survey data
that reveals a declining number
of rapes and attempted rapes.

However, 6% of W&L
women surveyed in 2005 re-
ported that they were victims of
an attempted rape. While this
percentage is down from the
8.5% reported in 2004, it is still
much higher than the 4% of stu-
dents nation-wide who have been
victims of attempted rapes. On
an equally alarming note, 21%
of women surveyed reported ex-
periencing sexual battery, a rate
similar to the 2004 rate and
nearly twice the nationally re-
ported average. This year, only
1% of W&L women reported ac-
tually being raped, a sharp drop
from last year’s statistics’ and a
figure that is approximately half
of the national average.

Shortly after Winter Break,
Acting-President Harlan
Beckley, Dean of Students Dawn
Watkins, Vice President _of Com-
munications Tim Kolly, and Di-
rector of Student Health Services
Dr. Jane Horton sat down with
editors from the Phi and Trident
to review and discuss these sta-
tistics as well as other data re-
garding sexual assault and alco-

_ hol use at W&L.

Several times during the
meeting and in a press release,
Dean Watkins emphasized that
“one rape, one assault, is too
much.” Mr. Kolly added that the
school “still has a long ways to
go,” but said the administration
“finds the trends [of fewer as-
saults] encouraging.”

The 2004 results were gath-
ered withthe National College
Health Assessment (NCHA),
while the most recent results
come from the CORE Alcohol

, and Drug Survey. All responses

both years were voluntary and
anonymous. Because Dr. Horton
believes “that a majority of inci-
dents are alcohol related,” the
survey also contains extensive
questions about the drinking be-
haviors of students. Mr. Kolly
added that, “National fraternity
survey results say 90% of sexual
assaults involve either alcohol or
drugs.”

The data on alcohol use con-
tains several positive trends,
though in most areas the univer-

sity remains far above national
averages. Washington and Lee
students reported blacking out,
suffering injuries, and doing
things they’ve regretted later
more often than their peers na-
tion—wide.

Dr. Horton also shared fresh
data on drinking patterns that
was gathered from the
Alcohol.edu surveys completed
by all freshmen during summer
and again during fall term.
Nearly three out of every four
students reported playing drink-
ing games, chugging beers, and
taking shots, while more than
half admitted to drinking before
going out.

According to Dr. Horton, this
data “suggests that this is the en-
vironment being set up by our
current system. This is fall term
freshman year,” she added. “It’s
a very high risk time for fresh-
men.”

In contrast to the other three
administrators present, Acting-
President Beckley remained
quiet for most of the meeting.
When asked why he had come,
he replied that he wanted to be
present “because [the adminis-
tration] wants students to know
that we all think this is an impor-

 

tant issue on our campus.”
Perhaps the most encouraging
information to emerge from this
year‘s survey is the sharply drop-
ping drunk driving rate.
Whereas almost half of all W&L
students reported driving under

administration wants

HARLAN BECKLEY, ACTING
PRESIDENT

the inﬂuence in 1999, only a
quarter of students in 2005 re-
ported doing the same thing.
Drunk driving is one of the only
survey categories where W&L
students rank below the national
average; the administration cred-
its W&L’s Traveller service for
this drop.

“Traveller has been beefed up
significantly in the last five
years,” Dean Watkins said, “and
it’s been overhauled in the last
two years. It’s more reliable and

 
 

consistent now, while student
involvement continues to be
strong.” _

Dean Watkins and Dr. Horton
also met with the Inter-fratemity
Council and Pan-Hellenic to dis-
cuss the survey data and explore
solutions that could further lower
incidences of sexual assault and
risky drinking behavior. The
dean of students said that “both
groups were quick to respond
last year” when the initial survey
data was released. She pointed
to the new Gender Relations
Council as an example of the
Greek governing organization’s
initiatives.

Another active participant in
the battle against sexual assault
is Project Horizon, a community-
wide organization that educates
people about sexual assault and
provides support to victims. Sa-
rah Beth Campbell, a senior who
is active with the group, said that
despite the heightened focus on
the issue, “nothing really seems
to have changed.”

“Awareness is higher this
year,” she said, attributing
progress in that area to the work
SPEAK, a women’s group
founded by Dr. Jen Sayre, a
member of the University Coun-

almost half of W&L students surveyed
admitted to driving under the influence

seling department. SPEAK talks
with freshmen girls to educate
them on the risks of sexual as-
sault at W&L.

Nonetheless, Campbell feels
that W&L’s culture still has a
way to go.

“Some of the culture is a re-
sult of the alcohol; it lowers
everyone’s inhibitions, making
guys less aware of what they’re
doing and leaving girls more vul-
nerable. A lot of the inappropri-
ate touching goes on in these
parties in frat basements.”

Still, Campbell said that alco-
hol was not solely to blame.
“Part of the problem is our hook-
up culture; lots of guys and girls
go out with the intention of hook-
ing up. The physical aspect of
relationships is emphasized
here.”

Campbell offered some final
thoughts on the issue of sexual
battery, saying that she worries
“some people don’t consider it
to be an important issue.”

Nevertheless, she felt that
change is possible on this cam-
pus. “I believe people here are
good, decent people. No one
would do this sort of inappropri-
ate touching when they were so-
ber.”

Why Dr. Cornel West matters

Nationally known Princeton University professor and activist speaks at W&L

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS EDITOR

Who is Dr. Comel West? A
religion professor at Princeton?
A movie star? A rapper? An
activist? Perhaps he’s all of
those things. West is scheduled
to speak on campus Monday
night, and the ﬂiers tacked up ev-
erywhere say his topic will be
“Why Democracy Matters.”
West’s most recent book caries
the same title.

West has been called “the pre-
eminent African—American intel-
lectual of our generation.” That
compliment was delivered by
Henry Louis Gates, Jr., chairman
of the Afro-American studies
program at Harvard.

West has certainly spent time

at plenty of preeminent institu-
tions, receiving an undergradu-
ate degree in Near Eastern Lan-
guages and Literature after
spending just three years at
Harvard. He later received a
Ph.D. from Princeton. West has
taught in three Ivy League
schools — Harvard, Princeton,
and Yale’s Divinity School - as
well teaching at the University of
Paris during the spring of 1987.
While at Yale he was ar-
rested during protests against
apartheid South Africa, and when
the school canceled his leave for
the spring of 1987 he commuted
between Yale and Paris, teach-
ing two classes at the former in-
stitution and three at the latter.
In 1988 West headed for
Princeton, where he worked with

noted author Toni Morrison to
improve the school’s African-
American studies program; West
served as the program’s director
from 1988 to 1994. West pub-
lished a best selling collection of
essays in 1993 entitled Race
Matters.

After teaching at Harvard for
several years, West became em-
broiled in a spat with then-re-
cently appointed President
Lawrence Summers, who caused

BEHIND
BARS

Here’s to laughing at the
expense of those who
learned their lessons this
weekend. News Editor
Jacob Geiger took a peek
at this week's police reports
to see what you’ve been up
to during Rush Week and
especially Tear Night.

Don ’t worry, we only used

your initials.

Lawless lawyers

Usually law students sit in
court as a counsel to the
accused. Now it looks like
the counsel will need
counsel. CD, a second
year law student from
Newark, Delaware, ran
afoul of the police at 2 AM
on Saturday the 14'“. After
determining that CD was
drunk, the officers went

ahead and issued a citation
for public drunkenness. At
press time the Phi had not
heard whether the offender
would hire a classmate or
decide to represent himself.

Guess who's back

back again?

Behind Bars is pleased
(well, not really) to
announce the first repeat
offender to appear in this
space. EB, who was
stopped while running
down Nelson St. at 4 AM
one night this fall, was
arrested for a second time
during Tear Night
festivities. EB was sent
home under the escort of
fellow pledge DM, and all
seemed well until EB face-
planted thirty feet away
from two police officers.
The officers sauntered over
and arrested both
gentlemen, despite DM’s
protestations that he was

“only trying to walk his

friend home.” After a
breathalyzer test the
officers decided that both
gentlemen would need to
visit the station, and tear
night was officially over
for these freshmen, who
now face counts of public
drunkenness and underage
posession.

Please obey all

posted signs

Lexington’s maze of one
way streets can be
confusing, but Behind Bars
hadalways assumed that
most juniors had the streets
ﬁgured out by now.
Apparently not. Junior
MC was arrested at 10 AM
on Thursday the 12"‘ for
driving the wrong way on a
one way street. At least she
wasn’t speeding while
doing so. W&L really does
run this town, MC, but
obeying traffic signs is still
required.

Just focus on the lines
On Saturday January 7"‘
sophomore MN got so
wrapped up in not swerving
that she forgot to turn on her
headlights. So it goes to
ﬁgure that even if she was
driving straight and police
officer would notice her.
And one did. And then he
arrested her not only for
driving with no headlights
but also for a DUI. Behind
Bars isn’t even going to

. make a joke here. 25% of
W&L students drive drunk.
That’s just stupid, and this is
supposed to be a school for
smart kids.

Don’t drink and shoot

A ragin’ cajun by the name
of MM of Mandeville, LA
was arrested for a DIP and
carrying a concealed
weapon. Perhaps that’s
acceptable in Louisiana, but
in Virginia the police tend to
think that drinking and
shooting don’t mix.

Searching for a new leader  

Working behind the scenes, the universitys Presidential Search Committee continues to make progress

Law Professor Brian Murchison and other

members of the search committee outline their

goals and views on the hunt for a new president.

By Ashley Brightwell

REPORTER

The search for the next Presi-
dent of Washington and Lee
University has been continuing
to make progress over the last
several months. The Presidential
Search Committee, headed by
law professor Brian Murchison,
has been working diligently to
narrow a pool of approximately
150 candidates down to a single
individual who will take over the
leadership of the university.

Professor Brian Murchison of
the law school is the Chair of the
Presidential Search Committee
and has taught at W&L for 23
years. He explained that the pro-
cess is composed of several
steps. The first involved hiring
a professional consultant, Bar-
bara Taylor, to assist in the
search and forming a committee
of faculty, staff, alurrmi, trustees
and students.

This first step of the process
also included soliciting nomina-
tions from the public, which the
Committee did by placing an
advertisement of the position in
the Chronicle of Higher Educa-
tion. From September to No-
vember the group received
nominations from alumni,
former professors, and friends of
the school.

The second stage, which oc-
curred around the same time,
involved encouraging those who
would be good candidates to
apply for the position. The cur-
rent phase has involved narrow-
ing down a pool of about 150
applicants to less than 30. This
will be followed by a formal in-
terview process in February and
an announcement of the new
president shortly thereafter.

When asked about the pro-
cess of the search, Professor
Murchison said that the job “is
on schedule thanks to a very
hard working and industrious
committee. I would hope that we
know something in March or
April, but I don’t want to jinx
it,”

Professor Murchison’s opti-
mism is shared by Search Com-
mittee member Dean Hank
Dobin, who said that the search
should be over by April.

Dean Dobin, who is new to
the school this year, also had his
opinions on the qualities the new
president should possess.

Though he explained that he
has tried not to have any precon-
ceived notions, because “it
would be good for the commit-
tee to have as open a mind as
possible”, he does think that the
person should have experience
as a faculty member and be ac-
cessible to the different constitu-

encies. Dobin also said that
“though the idea of ﬁt is impor-
tant, it can be somewhat over-
rated. We want someone who
will respect this institution and
its traditions but who is willing
and able to challenge us.”

The idea of fit does seem to
be an issue in this search, espe-
cially when it comes to the val-
ues people expect from the
president. Generally, older pro-
fessors value tradition and hope
for a president who maintains
and protects traditions, while
newer professors seem more
open to change.

“The job is on
schedule thanks to
a very hard working
and industrious
committee. ”

BRIAN MURCHISON,
SEARCH COMMITTEE
CHAIRMAN
 

Professor David Dickens,
who has taught German at Wash-
ington and Lee for 45 years, be-
lieves that the president should
“improve what needs to be im-
proved, strengthen those things
that make us a good university,
and make no impetuous radical
change.”

On the other side, Professor
James Mahon, a Philosophy pro-
fessor of six years at W&L, be-
lieves that “it is actually quite
signiﬁcant if you have a presi-

dent who is liberal, and I do think
all our presidents have been lib-
eral. I genuinely believe that lib-
eral presidents are more con-
cerned with change and improve-
ment than their conservative
counterparts. A good president
will find new things to do for the
university.”

These two opinions both have
their merits and when blended
seem to show a model of presi-
dency that is best for Washing-
ton and Lee. This is only one of
the many considerations that the
Committee must make in the
search.

There is also the question of
whether we should break the
mold of 250 years of male presi-
dents and appoint a woman to the
position, and whether the next
president should be from Wash-
ington and Lee.

Though she is in favor of hav-
ing a woman as president, Dean
Dawn Watkins also made it clear
that “it’s more about the charac-
ter and quality of the person than
their gender.”

The current Acting President,
Dr. Harlan Beckley, also sup-
ports the prospect of a woman
president and believes it could
help the school to grow, though
he, like Dean Watkins, believes
that other qualities are more im-
portant. “We would be proud to
have a female president,” he

said, “and should be proud. It
would affirm that Washington
and Lee is able to welcome lead-
ership from any president who is
qualified, regardless of gender,
ethnicity or religion, and who

can become dedicated to W&L.”

Questions about the new
president’s ties to Washington
and Lee are another factor in the
decision, with some faculty
members remembering with dis-
pleasure what one called “the
Burish experience” and what
some saw as his attempts to
transform W&L into something
it wasn’t by increasing the bu-
reaucracy.

These individuals feel that
someone connected to the uni-
versity could better understand
and appreciate the things that
make it unique.

Others, such as Dr. Beckley,
are of the belief that it isn’t im-
portant that the president be con-
nected to Washington and Lee so
long as “he or she is the kind of
person who could become at-
tached to the university.”

With the end of the search
coming, students also need to
consider what they want in a
president and remain as active in
the search process. Information
is readily accessible on the
university’s webpage, and meet-
ings occur regularly that are

open to everyone. ,

Acting President Beckley was
Chair of the last Presidential
Search Comrriittee and has served
as a professor at Washington and
Lee for 32 years. He possesses a
unique perspective on the matter,
having been President and a
member of the constituency, as
well as being involved in a past
Presidential Search Committee.

Having experienced the duties
of position, Dr. Beckley brought
up some qualities that some
people might not realize that the
president needs, “an interest in

' communicating with many differ-

ent people about their concerns,
a willingness to be patient in com-
municating with the constituen-
cies, a vision of what W&L can
be, and a capacity to deal with
many issues.” ’

Dr. Beckley also commented
on what he wants from his suc-
cessor. “I want the person who
follows me to be a good presi-
dent. It is a privilege and a joy
and a significant responsibility to
be the president of Washington
and Lee. I want a person who will
take on that role and be willing
to lead us to an even better fu-
ture.”

Culture must change

Alarming statistics reveal continuing problems in gender relationships

It’s a shame that an editorial
has to be written about the preva-
lence of sexual assault in 2006,
but ignoring the problem solves
nothing.

The fact remains that al-
though we attend a prestigious
institution, which should be void
of immature and irresponsible
actions, sexual assault still oc-
curs with completely unaccept-
able regularity

While we acknowledge that
the University has begun to take
steps towards ﬁnding a solution,
we would like to address issues
that we feel are factors that cause
these transgressions and suggest
our own solutions.

Washington and Lee is known
as one of the top party schools
in the nation, and many students
boast about our drinking status.
We can still throw down with the
best of them; however, many stu-
dents use drunkeness as a justi-
ﬁcation for an assult or rape.

The use of date rape drugs, al-
cohol and other means to inhibit
one’s decision-making ability is
an inexcusable violation of an-
other person’s rights. Not only is
it against the law, it ought to be
an Honor Violation since it darn-
ages our community. No system
based on honor can long survive

when the very trust that is its base
is damaged or broken.

It’s amazing that at aschool
with less than 2,000 people that
individuals can feel comfortable
behaving this way, yet with the
strict social standards people
want to live up to, too many stu-
dents feel obliged to forgive and
forget.

There are cases when a
woman who has been sexually
assaulted has refused to turn in
her attacker because she fears
being socially ostracized not
only from the fraternity where it
occurred, but from her own
group of friends as well.

By failing to report the as-
sault, women also continue the
vicious cycle as the perpetrators
never feel as though they have
to pay for their actions.

We feel it is a problem that
there are more negative social
consequences for the victim than
for the attacker. Students are re-
sponsible for creating an envi-
ronment in which sexual assualt
is not tolerated. A rapist should
not be patted on the back or con-
gratulated, and a victim should
not be an outcast. Unfortunately
this is what happens all to fre-
quently at our school. It is time
for this mindset to change.

Suggestive actions, provocative

dancing, or revealing dress are never

excuses for rape, but if sexual assault

is going to be eliminated, women must

be ladies and men must be gentlemen.
 

Sexual assualt is a double-
edged sword; men cannot be the
only ones that are held respon-
sible to change these statistics.

While is is never acceptable
to take advantage of a woman,
regardless of how exposed she
is, women must take more re-
sponsibility for their actions
while out partying because
sometimes they may lead people
to believe that they are willing
to do more than they may actu-
ally want.

Suggestive actions,
provacative dancing, or reveal-
ing dress are never excuses for
rape, but if sexual assault if go-
ing to be eliminated, women
must be ladies and men must be
gentlemen.

Men are also not the only ones
that commit sexual assault. There

have been several reported in-
stances where men have felt as
though they have been taken ad-
vantage of sexually. Even though
they may enjoy it at the time,
these men are in no condition to
make a rational decision to par-
ticipate in these promiscuous
activities.

The problem of sexual assault
will not vanish, despite the
University’s best efforts, until
students decide to take respon-
sibility and consciously choose
to change their own actions. Fi-
nally, every student must refuse
to tolerate sexual assault.

W&L alum Paul Seifert opens art show from his travels as a Watson Fellow

The prestigious Watson Fellowship allowed Paul Seifert to unite his two

passions: art and ﬁshing. He traveled around the world observing and

painting fishing villages.

On his venture he turned out fine artwork,

discovered the larger world, and gained a new perspective on life.

By Nadja Wolfe
smrr warren

On Friday, January 13th, Wash-
ington and Lee alum and
Watson fellow Paul Seifert, ’04,
opened an exhibit of artwork he
created on his travels last year
at the AL-SO Gallery in Dallas.

As a Watson fellow, Seifert
was able to combine his love of
ﬁshing and of art as he traveled
to South America, Africa, Asia,
and the Middle east, studying
fishing cultures and capturing
them on paper and ﬁlm.

The col1ection’s ink draw-
ings capture what Seifert calls
the “frenzied outbreak of mo-
tion” that occurs when the
boats came in. “I would be on
the sand in the middle of the
frenzy, with ink and a reed pen,
marking down whatever bod-
ies and objects passed in front
of me,” he said.

These pieces capture the
throbbing activity of each lo-
cation, from Brazil to Malay-
sia.

Given the frenetic activity
rushing across the pages of his
pen and ink work, it is inter-
esting that Seifert gained a

new appreciation for slowing
down and sitting with his own
thoughts.

In watching the people
around him, he says, he ob-
served a lack of the hurried-
ness to which he is accus-
tomed. A

Inconveniences, such as a
six hour wait for a bus, became
opportunities to reﬂect and ob-
serve. “For me,” Seifert said,
“thinking takes time, and it is
best done on its own and not
as part of a multitask.” It is no
surprise, then, that this intro-
spection carried over to his
artwork.

The ink drawings captured

l the pace of the motion before

him as he observed the every-
day tasks of the ﬁshermen.
However, in his oil work
painted at night, Seifert dem-
onstrates a tempest of intensity
through vibrant scenes only
less active at a cursory glance.
He also uses bright color to
communicate the vibrant and
exciting lifestyle of the villag-
ers. Although they lack the
same level of physical motion
found in the -drawings, the

‘strength of thought in the

paintings has an action all its
own that enthralls and in-
trigues.

Seife1t’s travels have given
him a lot to think about as well.

He hopes through his art to
open others’ eyes to a world
much larger than it often
seems, and would be pleased
should others be inspired to
look beyond the world they
know.

, Seifert has also gained per-
spective, hinting that he sees
the world through a lens not
necessarily focused on his own
needs and actions. It is this
viewpoint that has helped him
to be “perfectly, unconsciously
content with the sitting and do-
ing nothing,” happy to be part
with and observer of every-
thing surrounding him.

This gallery exhibit is the
first for Paul Seifert, who has
hopes for future showings and
to sell his work on display .

Night of sixty-five roses

The Cystic Fibrosis Charity Ball raises money to battle the disease and provides entertainment for students

Shunning the frat scene for an evening, students

danced the night away in the classy atmosphere of

Evans to raise money for CF research.

By Nadja Wolfe
STAFF WRITER

Saturday night, W&L stu-
dents gathered in Evans Dining
Hall for an evening of dancing——
and to raise money for the Cys-
tic Fibrosis Foundation.

The CF Charity Ball
Committee’s annual fundraiser,
“A Night of Roses,” directly ben-
eﬁts research for a cure to the
illness which affects thirty thou-
sand Americans, with a thousand
new cases being diagnosed each
year.

Cystic Fibrosis is caused by
a genetic defect that inhibits lung
function and interferes with the

troubling illness. ”

digestive tract.

CF treatment has made sig-
nificant strides due to extensive
research, so that CF patients are
now living into their thirties.

The illness is also a prime fo-
cus of gene therapy research, an
area of research that shows much
promise in ﬁnding a cure.

“CF research is a very great
thing to support,” said James
Heidbreder, ’08, chair of the CF
Charity Ball Committee.

“They’re on the edge of the

cure. You get a lot more bang
for your buck—all they need is
more research.” And, thanks to
the EC’s generous funding, he
added, 100% of the evening’s
proceeds go directly to the foun-
dation.

The ball, named for a symbol

of the CFF because children with ‘

the disease often pronounce it as
“sixty five roses,” was a great
success. Burr Datz’s band,
Monrovia, and caller Becky
Mackenzie, had the room square
and contra dancing all evening.

Although new to many
people, the room was ﬁlled with
smiles as dancers learned figures
and steps such as ladies’ chain
and promenade.

Not knowing the moves was
a beneﬁt, said committee mem-
ber Dane Boston, ’08.

“When you go to a [regular]
dance... it’s things some people
are really good at, and some
people aren’t,” but since
everyone’s learning, everyone
can have fun.

The CF Charity Ball comn1it—
tee, with an active membership
of about twenty people, hopes to
fill Evans next year.

“We’d like to see more people
out here... having fun at the
dance,” said Boston.

For next year’s ball, said
Heidbreder, “we’ve been kicking
around the idea of a swing dance,
[which] might have more popu-
lar appeal.”

The comrnittee’s plans are not
only limited to the yearly ball,
however. Heidbreder also men-

tioned plans for a Valentine’s
Day fundraiser selling CFF teddy
bears for sweetheart gifts, as well
as participating in the Great
Strides Walk, CF’s version of the
Relay for Life.

Raising awareness about CF
and increasing student participa-
tion in events are also on the

agenda.
“You really feel like you’re
doing something,” said

Heidbreder, “A cure is really
close.”
And since the EC is funding

events, every dollar goes to help
the people who need it most.

“I think it’s a great evening
for a very wonderful cause,” said
Boston.

Ball attendee Debby Newell,
’08, agrees. “I came because it’s
a lot of fun and because I think
CF is a really troubling and seri-
ous illness for children,” she
said. “So it’s a win-win situa-
tion.”

Newell is right. Cystic Fibro-
sis is a serious illness that affects
many people.

And right now, as Heidbreder
says, “research is very cutting
edge,” because it is so close to a
cure.

The more students partici-
pate, the money we raise, the
closer we get to a cure.

As a university community
with many luxuries and an active
nightlife, it’s easy to forget about
causes such as the CFF.

“I would’ve come if it wasn’t
for charity,” said Newell, “but
because it’s for charity, I couldn’t
not come.”

Hopefully, more students will
adopt her positive attitude and
help raise money for CF re-
search.

Heidbreder’s committee
raised just over $1,550 for the
CF Foundation, with proceeds
from ticket sales and generous
donations. Said Heidbreder, “I
was pleasantly surprised at the
spontaneous generosity of the
University community. Strang-
ers and students alike gave gen-
erously, and we’re grateful.”

The W&L-Mart

What would W&L students and local residents dowithout this vital store?

It is a relief to know that
there is nothing that we
need that cannot be
found at the wonderful
world of Wal-Mart.

By Hugh Trout
COLUMNIST

While Lexington doesn’t have
sex appeal, a real bar scene, or
many two—way streets, it does
have one asset that is simply in-
dispensable to maintaining the
way of life we share here in
LexVegas: Wal-Mart.

Without this mega-store, nay,
ultimate—store, many of us might
have gone days without tooth-
paste, discounted fake spinner
wheels, or cheap high—powered
rifles.

While some students are hesi-
tant about patronizing a store
with questionable business prac-
tices, Lexington offers few other
options for. dorm and household
goods at a reasonable price.

When you can get every-
thing you need from a buck call
to a cartilage piercing in one
huge building, the convenience
of the store outweighs many
negatives. The efficiency of
shopping for food and mixers

simultaneously is hard to pass
up.

Wal-Mart can give you what
you didn’t even know you
needed. Here are some ex-
amples:

- a razor that has one more
blade than your current one does

— Cheap Hillary Duff posters

- Saved By the Bell DVD com-
plete collection (Time out, Kelly
is going to the prom with
Slater?!)

— discounted fake spinner
wheels for my car

— anything camouﬂage

So what doesn’t Wal-Mart
sell? For the edification of all
those who have little or no Wal-
Mart experience, I have com-
prised a short list of what cannot
be purchased at Wal-Mart.

- Pride. You cannot buy pride
from Wal-Mart if you have lost
yours. Got drunk and pissed
your top bunk bed with someone
else in it? Yeah, you can search
those aisles all day but you will
never be able to replace a loss of
pride like that.

— Chuck Norris DVDs— trust
me, I’ve tried.

- Remote controlled blimps as
seen in Sky Mall magazine

— First semester freshmen year.
Wouldn’t that be nice to do over
again?

— A sincere belief that it is them

Without this mega-store, nay, ultimate-
store, many of us might have gone days
without toothpaste, discounted fake spinner
wheels, or cheap high-powered rifles.

and not you. Come on. . .you
know the truth. . .it was you.

— Ace of Base music videos on
DVD

- $1 blue Corona Extra san—
dals. That’s right, they’re all out
and I got on that before they sold
out. I use them as my shower
sandals to let everyone know
how rad I am.

- Direction in life. Remem-
ber how you wanted to be a ﬁre-
man or a princess when you were
younger?

At what point did I decide to
say the hell with being a profes-
sional kick ass rock star and
started worrying about the fast-
est way I could get into a cubi-
cal?

Watching Oﬂice Space is be-
coming less of pleasurable expe-
rience and more like a Ms. Cleo
vision of what my life is going
to be in three years.

The worst part of it all will
be when I’m drunk in an airport
bar and want to get angry at
someone for why I’m not giving

high ﬁves to Jack White or do-
ing Jager shots with Kelly
Clarkson the only person I can
blame will be myself because I
traded in my dream of melting
faces for crunching numbers.

If you keep compromising
yourself and giving parts of what
you want to get out of life away
to those who want you to be prac-
tical and fit into the norm one day
you’ll wake up and find out that
you are a shell of a person who
no longer has an identity, and
identities are not sold at any Wal-
Mart.

— Dunkaroos...damn, those
were good.
- A decent Super Soaker
- Starbucks... (That would be
one sweet axis of corporate evil).
So remember: while it can be
an unpredictable and demanding
world, Wal-Mart cannot provide
everything, but it will be able to
sell you all the cleaning, food,
baby, beauty, entertainment, and
hunting supplies you’ll need to
get through. S

What are you doing at Wal-Mart? Whether
or not we have moral qualms about the
store, its convenience and the lack of other
options have made us dependent.

Crystal Benevides,
freshman, says she visits
Wal-Mart at least twice a
month. “I like it, it’s not
HEB, but it’s cool.”

Amy Karwan, sophomore, says she visits Wal-Mart once
every two weeks. “You can ﬁnd everything at Wal-Mart. It’s
also perfect for mixer costume shopping. Right now, I am
buying supplies for a Zoolander mixer.”

Max Vilenchik, sophomore, says that he visits Wal-Mart
about once every two weeks. “WalMart is fine. It’s
convenient.”

 

 

Victoria Childress,
sophomore, says she visits
Wal-mart once a month.
“Not a big fan of Wal-mart’s
business practices, but it’s
so convienient and there’s
nowhere else to go.”

Srebrenica

rememberance

Ten years. after the United
Nations abandoned the
town of Srebrenica to
Serbian’ murder squads,
the W&L community re-
members the atrocity with‘
an exhibit in Leybuin Li-
brary. On Tuesday, Janu-

‘ any 3 1 st and Tuesday,

February 7th documenta-
ries about the tragedy will
be shown in the library’s
Northen auditorium. The
first film shown will be
“Srebrenica: A Cry from
the Grave,” and the sec-
ond will be “Calling the
Ghosts: A Story of Rape,
Women, and War.” Both
ﬁlms begin at 7pm.

corrections

Last week’s article,
“Why Dr. Comel West
matters,” incorrectly
quoted Harvard Presi-
dent Larry Summers,
who did not say “there
are ‘issues of intrinsic
aptitude’ separating men
and women.” Summers
actually said there is a
“different availability of
aptitude at the high end”
of science professions.

Administration considers serious alterations to W&L residential life

Despite student indifference to W&L’s new Strategic Plan initiatives, serious changes to the

university’s housing situation could be coming soon. While many of the proposals may not

be adopted, several have the potential to radically alter housing both on campus and off.

By Melissa Caron
STAFF WRITER

Much talk in recent months has
evolved around the proposed
Strategic Plan, a series of
proposals that look to change or
rework various facets of the
school’s community. One area of
considerable interest involves the
recommended changes to student
housing that the plan covers.

“It is safe to say that there has
been a strong interest to improve
housing,” said Joseph Grasso,
Vice President of Administration.
Grasso served as campus chair for
the Capital and Space Planning
Task Force, which was one of the
several groups responsible for
compiling a report of suggestions
for the plan.

Grasso points out that the most
recent major renovation to have
taken place was in 1987 and
involved the construction of
Gaines Hall. While smaller
projects have taken place in the
years since, he notes that the next

generation of projects will
probably be much larger in scale.

“The nature of the next
renovation will focus on such
things as air conditioning and
common spaces for students,”
Grasso said. “Both of those will
require significant structural
changes.”

Provost Thomas Williams, co-
chair of the Consolidation
Committee, which is responsible
for going over and compiling a
ﬁnal plan from the suggestions
that came out of the different task
forces, points out that much of
what is proposed for residential
life involves improving the
condition of existing buildings.

“I don’t believe we have any
serious safety concerns,”
Williams said. “But modern
buildings are safer.”

The administration hopes that
by improving residential life,
Washington and Lee will be at a
better competitive level with other
schools when it comes to
attracting the best and brightest
students to the campus. Similarly,

as Williams points out, modern
buildings will be more energy
efficient, something very
important to consider with rising
fuel prices.

Greeks review plans

While it is hard to argue that
the dorms are not in need of
renovation, other elements of the
plan have proven to be more
controversial.

“In general I liked a lot of the
ideas, but felt that sometimes they
were trying to move the school in
the direction of other schools and
address issues they had,” junior
Nadia Prinz said. “Students on the
committee seemed to be more
concerned with the preservation
of the W&L identity.”

Prinz served on the Greek
Strategic Plan Review
Committee, a student run group
that was called together to read
and discuss the’ strategic plan and

BEHIND
BARS

Here’s to laughing at the
expense of those who ran
afoul of the law during the
\last few weeks. News editor
Jacob Geiger took a peek
at this week’s police reports
to see what you’ve been up
to. Though Behind Bars
has only one W&L arrest to
report, an interesting mix of
local residents and out-of-
town visitors kept the po-
lice busy over the last few
weeks. Don ’t worry, only

initials were printed.

Late night?

Or an early morning?
Twenty-two year old MB
was arrested early — well,
not that early — on Satur-
day, January 8"‘. Records
from the Lexington Police
Department indicate that

  
 

MB was booked at 5:17
AM that morning. 5:17!
Now that must have been
one hoppin’ late night
party. The weekend was
unusually quiet due to Pan—
Hellenic’s pre—rush no con-
tact, but there was still
enough going on for MB
to run into trouble.

One way red ux

As discussed in the last is-
sue of Behind Bars,
Lexington’s warren of one ‘
way streets can be confus-
ing at times. They’re even
more difficult to navigate
if the driver is drunk. GW,
age thirty—eight, was
stopped while traveling the
wrong way on a one way
street at 1:15 AM on Janu-
ary 12”‘. Adding insult to
injury, GW, who was ar-
rested for driving under
the inﬂuence, was also
cited for failing to use his
headlights.

No darling, you may
not borrow my car
Lexington resident TN was
also arrested on January
12"‘ for a driving offense.
The thirty-eight year old
was charged with “unau-
thorized use of a vehicle,”
a felony offense. TN is re-
ported to have taken her
father’s car without his per-
mission. Behind Bars won-
ders what’s worse: being
charged with a felony after
taking your father’s car or
the major grounding that
seems sure to follow.

A long litany

of poor decisions
Quiet Lexington usually
sees just one or two felony
charges each month. Last
Tuesday, however, JP of
Buena Vista managed to
rack up ﬁve charges by
himself. Four of the
charges are listed were
“attempt[s] to maliciously

wound,” while the ﬁfth
was for a hit-and—run with
property damage greater
than one thousand dollars.
Not content with the five
felony counts, JP picked
up two serious misde-
meanor charges: domestic
assault and battery along
with violating a protective
order. The entire incident
occurred shortly before
midnight; Officer
Kesterson made the arrest
at 11:45. By the time the
booking was completed,
Lexington’s felony count
for January had more than
doubled.

to report back to their
chapters about what was
discussed.

One such element that has met
heated debate from both sides
involves the possibility of
creating learning communities
within the residential buildings.
Halls would be organized based
upon academic interests and a
couple faculty members would
live in the dorms in order to
engage students in social and
intellectual discussion.

Grasso points out that the aim
of this would be to bolster the
academic program.

Prinz says that this aspect of
the plan met a lot of criticism
from the student committee and
others outside of it, and she feels
that it probably won’t be
included in the final plan.

“It is antithetical to the whole
liberal arts education,” Prinz
said. “You have the rest of your
life to be with people in your
field.”

Reverse exodus

Another area that has met
some opposition is whether or
not upper—classmen should live
on campus. Currently many
juniors and seniors live off
campus in apartments or houses
that either they or their Greek
organization rent. Suggestions
under the plan have included
improving the condition of
current on—campus residencies,
thereby increasing their appeal
to upperclassmen, or having
upperclassmen live in the Greek
houses.

Williams says that while they
do recognize that many people
are interested in maintaining the

tradition of living off campus, he
feels that there are many beneﬁts
for having juniors and seniors on
campus and even in the fraternity
and sorority houses.

“There is still some
discussion, but it is not currently
driven by a desire to house more
upperclassmen but driven more
by whether having juniors and
seniors living in the house will
provide greater leadership
potential,” Williams said.

Community effects

One thing that was considered
when this proposal came up in
committee was the effect a
massive housing shift would
have on the economy‘ of the
town, since many students rent
right off campus.

“The University tries to be
careful and not compete with the
local economy,” Williams said.

 felt that sometimes they were trying to move

the school in the direction of other schools and

address issues they had.”
-NADIA PRINZ, CLASS OF 2007

“However, one serious concern
is the condition of some of the
rental units. There are some
safety concerns.”

Safety concerns

Williams describes their plan
as more market driven than
anything. He says that the
campus recognizes that there is
a student market for housing.
Some students are dissatisfied
with their housing in town, and
he feels that by building better

housing on campus the school is
only encouraging the market to
improve. It would ultimately be
the students’ decisions of
whether or not to live on campus.

Grasso also points out that
building better housing on
campus will conuibute to greater
safety in the community,
especially for those living out in
the country.

“There are some safety
concerns for students when they
live 15 or so miles out on a windy

  Debate on housing heats up

road and they still have classes
on a snowy day,” Grasso said.

Looking ahead

The strategic plan is currently
being looked at by the
Consolidation Committee,
whose job is to consider the
recommendations given by the
assigned task forces and various
other committees and to consider
what criticisms came out of such
meetings. They will begin to
piece together and prioritize all
the information into a final
report.

Grasso feels that as the
university approaches this step of
the process it is important for
student involvement.

“What do students want?”
Grasso said. “We need to do a
better job in understanding what
students want for housing
alternatives.”

5:00 PM . 5:00 PM George Washington, playing
' in the highly underrated Atlantic-
2 10 Conference, has emerged as

one of the most surprising teams
in the country. With convincing
victories against Maryland,
Temple, and St. Josephs, the
Colonials might be the most
overlooked team in the country.
Their strong backcourt presence,

coupled with an experienced
coaching staff, creates a
formidable challenge for any

"postseason opponent.

The University of
Pennsylvania is much better
known for its intellectual
prowess than for its superior
basketball ability. Nevertheless,
Penn is a team that is ready to be

taken seriously. A rigorous‘

schedule including games
against Duke, Villanova,
Temple, and Princeton will
provide the Quakers with the
experience necessary to compete
against some of the best
programs in the country. This

Ivy League juggernaut will be a '

this March.

How to throw a Super Bowl party and not look stupid

Get your homework done before the game. N o matter
how hard you try, it is impossible to host a party or
watch the game while ﬁnishing your econ problems.
Read up on the game beforehand. ESPN Online is
a great resource ﬁnding facts so you can dazzle
your guests with football knowledge.
If you aren’t in the mood to prepare snacks, the"
Dining Hall provides takeout on Super Bowl
Sunday only. Here is the menu:

Have magazines lying about the TV room. You

can count on a disagreement arising between die-

hard fans about who beat who earlier in the season.

Having a sports magazine handy to check crucial

statistics can head off an argument. Include a few

magazines for the girls- sometimes we need a break

from all the testosterone.

Be sure to provide beverages for your sober guests.

Crystal Light is quick, easy, and makes a lot.

Get in the football mood. Play a game of pick—up

football or toss a football around before the game with

Football 101

The Super Bowl is rapidly approaching, and there are parties to be planned and

food to be prepared. But the fun of the Super Bowl is lost if you don ’t know what is

going on in the game. So for everyone who wants to be able to understand the best

game ever played or needs a quick refresher on the rules, here is a simple summary

of the objective of the game.

The game

Football is played by two
teams with eleven guys each on
a 120-yard long ﬁeld. The ob-
ject is to move the ball down
the ﬁeld, either by passing or
running it. The team must ad-
vance the ball 10 yards in the
direction of the opponent’s end
zone. They have four chances
(or downs) to accomplish this.
Otherwise, the ball is turned
over to the other team. When
the end zone is reached, a
touchdown is scored. If the
team feels that they cannot
reach the end zone, they have
the option of kicking a field
goal, which, if successful, will
count for three points.

Key terms

Quarterback: the gentleman
who does most of the passing.
It is unacceptable to call him
the point guard, the pitcher, or
the guy with the tight pants.
Stick to quarterback or QB.

Secondary: the defensive
players who line up behind the
defensive linemen.

Special teams: this refers to
the players who are on the ﬁeld
during a kickoff, punt, extra

point attempt or ﬁeld goal.

Turnover: when a team loses
possession of the football be-
cause of a fumble or intercep-
tion, they have committed a
turnover.

Flag on the play: when a pen-
alty is assessed, the referee
throws a yellow ﬂag to signal
that a rule has been broken.

First and seven: the team has
four chances, or downs, to ad-
vance the ball ten yards. The
first number refers to what try
they are on, and the second
number indicates how many
yards they have to go.

Red zone: this is the area in-
side the opponents’ twenty yard
line when the team with the
ball is close to scoring.

Running the option: this is a
play in which the QB has the
option of running, or, if he does
not see a hole opening up, he
may pitch it to his running
back, who follows just behind
him.

Line of scrimmage: this is the
line where the two teams line
up to begin each play. The
football is placed here before
the play starts.

Snap: this signals the begin-
ning of the play. The center
lineman hikes the ball between
his legs into the waiting hands
of the QB. Yes, it is awkward
positioning, but that is better
left unmentioned.

Blitz: this occurs when addi-
tional defenders attempt to
break through the offensive
line to tackle the quarterback.

Tackle/Sack: the ball carrier
must be forced down, or tack-
led to end a play. When a QB
is tackled behind the line of
scrimmage, this is called a
sack.

Hail Mary: when time is 11111-
ning out and a team is desper-
ate for points, they can throw a
long, high pass with the hopes
of connecting with a wide re-
ceiver for a score. Not always
successful, but always exciting.

Scoﬂng

Touchdown: worth six points

Field goal: worth three points ~

Extra point: (this is a confus-
ing one) woith one point
Two point conversion: (an-
other tough one) worth two
points

Safety: worth two points

Lip Synch raises money for charity while entertaining the student body

The Pavilion rocked to the beat of musical

hits and the noise of a screaming crowd of

students interested in fun and philanthropy.

By Jessica Shaw
STAFF WRITER

 

' The beat of Michael
Jackson’s hit, "I‘hril1er’
shook the Pavilion Friday
night as freshman Sandile
Khumalo and six of his
pledge brothers took the
stage.

' The building came alive
as students and faculty
stomped to the beat, bel-
lowing the words and
wildly shouting their ap-
provals. As the night pro-
gressed, hits like ‘Barbie
Girl’, ‘Yeah’, and ‘Discov-
ery Channel’ blasted as
groups competed for the
coveted Lip Synch title.

At this twentieth annual
performance, 25 groups
choreographed acts to raise
money for Students Against
Rockbridge Area Hunger
(S.A.R.A.H.).

Hosts of the competition
and officers of S.A.R.A.H.,
juniors Chris Lalli and
Pierce Owings were decked
out in outrageously shiny,
red jackets as they comi-
cally censored the show.

“I would have to say
that my favorite part of the
night is being on stage and

being able to act like a fool,
yet know that I am doing it
for a good cause,” Lalli
said.

These officers are also
in charge of selecting the
judge panel for Lip Synch,
comprised mostly of fac-
ulty members.

According to Lalli, they
try to select judges that
many students will recog-
nize including a member
from the EC. The judges
are responsible not only for
evaluating the acts, but also
for maintaining an appro-
priate presence on stage.

Students _forked over
ticket money to see many
of their friends get gonged
off stage for promiscuous
dancing or drunken stupid-
ity.
By the end of the night,
numerous acts had been cut
short due to lewd behavior.
Despite this judicial
‘power’, the audience wit-
nessed an excess of thongs,
speedos and spandex.

“Even though a number
of people were drunk, the
event in itself was awe-
some,” Khumahlo said.
“Some skits were quite gro-
tesque, but I guess different

    

Fiji pledges get down to Usher’s “Yeah.” After hours of prac-
tice, Lip Synch was their chance to showcase their talent.

 

Members of MSA groove to a medley of songs and the shouts

of an approving audience. Their team captured second place.

groups of people have dif-
ferent defmitions of fun.”

This year, Phi Psi’s
‘Thriller’ performance
claimed the ﬁrst place title.
According to group mem-
ber and freshman Brad
Bender, practices began at
least a week and a half
ahead of time.

Bender said the group
watched the Michael Jack-H
son video for reference,
and freshman Carson
Bruno altered some of the
more challenging moves.

Other group members
were freshmen Allan
Kisoma, Mike Kazior, Ben
Hoagland and Emerson
Bluhm.

This entertaining perfor-
mance was followed
closely by the second MSA
group that captured second
place.

The crowd raved about
their four-song combina-
tion choreographed by se-
niors Ashlee Metcalf,
Kristen Youngblood,
Kristin Evans and Kynai
Johnson.

After receiving second

- place, group member and

senior Julian Ledford said
he was very excited about
the act.

“I was proud of the la-
dies, and I could see that
they were pleased,” he said.
“It was a great feeling to
hear the crowd cheering for

MSA.”

‘Diamonds are a Girl’s
Best Friend’, performed by
the’ third Theta group,
awarded them third place in
the competition. This styl-
ish, jazzy ensemble was
choreographed mainly by
freshman Jennifer Lysenko.
These six Theta girls pulled
off a unique, creative per-
formance that left the
judges rocking in their
seats.

Group leader Lysenko
said, “I think we all added
something to the choreog-
raphy in the end. We had a
lot of personality in our
group, which made it fun.”

“I feel like it’s a great
way for the school to bond
and have a sense of com-
munity,” said sophomore
Alice Shih, who was a
member of last year’s win-
ning group. “It’s also won-
derful that it’s for charity.”

Thousands of dollars
earned each year from this
event are donated to local
food banks by S.A.R.A.H.
officers and their advisor
John Taffe. According to
Lalli, they have not re-
ceived the amount of the
total earnings from this
weekend yet.

Ledford said, “Lip Sync,
like lots of things on this
campus, is becoming a tra-
dition, and it is one that
students want to keep.”

THE RING-TUM PHI - 7

 

editorial

Lip servic

Does Lip Synch’s positive goal justify its debauchery?

Tackling the subject of stu-
dent——particularly underage stu-
dent——drinking is always danger-
ous.

But when it’s up on stage, in _

front of a large portion of the stu-
dent population (and some fac-

V ulty and community members,

too) it seems impossible to ig-
nore.

Part of the tradition of Lip
Synch is about putting together
an act as a team, and perform-
ing to an audience who paid ad-
mission in order to raise money
for charity. ’

The other part involves clan-
destine meetings in the bathroom
and a ﬂask.

Of course, this is all conjec-
ture on the Phi’s part, but let’s
be serious: underage drinking
runs rampant at Lip Synch.

This may not be much differ-
ent than any other frat party. The
administration has rules, and you
don’t see many kids with beer
cans or liquor bottles out in the
audience in the Pavilion.

It’s what you can’t see that
makes the difference.

The‘ pre—parties, the ﬂasks,
the water bottles filled with-—
well, it isn’t water.

After years of Lip Synch—ing
to new lows, the powers—that—be
must know about this——so why
haven’t they done anything
about it?

To the Editor:
I was deeply troubled when I
read the recent staff editorial
about sexual assault. One line of
the editorial, which you saw fit
to print in large, italicized font,
was the following: “Suggestive
actions, provocative dancing,
and revealing dress are never
excuses for rape, but if sexual
assault is going to be eliminated,
women must be ladies and men
must be gentlemen.” I argue that
not only are the three items you
list not excuses for rape, but they
do not even enter the universe
of relevant factors when assign-
ing responsibility. In fact, sexual
assault is not “a double-edged
sword,” as you write, but instead
a crime with a perpetrator and a
victim. The perpetrator is the
party who bears all of the guilt.
Rape is a violent crime which
does not happen by accident.
Rape victims should not be held
culpable in any way for the trau-
matic violation from which they
have suffered. By implying that
women’s clothes, dancing, and
“suggestive actions” play any
role at all in the occurrence of
rape, Ring—Tum Phi editors only
create an environment in which
women will be less willing to

speak out about sexual assault.

wholly undeserved guilt and

shame.

a ton of dough for SARAH,
which in turn fills the area pan-
tries with this one event.

Cracking down on the alco-
hol consumption at this event
would indubitably hurt both at-
tendance and participation.

The administration probably
couldn’t do much about it any-
way. In a school where fraternity
houses having no members over
the age of 21 can get an alcohol
permit, it’s hard to imagine some
kind of strict regulation of alco-
hol consumption.

Catching a few more kids in
the act of being kids would not
likely be worth the losses SA-
RAH would suffer.

Lip Synch has other positive
elements as well.

It’s one of the first activities
many pledge classes perform to-
gether, and, in that sense, helps
build morale for the “team.”

There’s also some excitement
in it. Getting up in front of so
many people, doing well (or not)
and being blatantly drunk but not
getting in trouble-—it’s enough to

Junior questions ethics

To the editor: ‘
Yesterday I decided to
pick up a Ring~tum Phi and
was disgusted at your, ‘Be-
hind Bars,’ section. During
the preamble I was hoping
that 3 humor article would
follow, maybe an anecdotal
account of Rush Week-or
Tear Night highlights. In-
stead, I found alow-brow
account of arrests, written
with a srnarrny sarcasm that
begs a few questions of its
author. Have you ever made
a mistake, or gotten in
trouble? Have you ever com»
mitted such a life altering of-
fense as a DUI? The conde-
scending toneof your piece
would suggest that you’ve
walked the straight and nar-
row since you first stood, and
maybe you have. But if you
haven’t, then remernberback
to a time when you screwed
up, plain and simple. Then
imagine if you had to answer
not just to the law, but also
to Washington and Lee.
I You exposed two students
who received DUIs. Without
any knowledge of the Law
SchooI’s policy, I can tell you
that the undergrad will likely
have to leave school for at
least a semester, in addition

to tliousands of dollars in’

fines and fees. {fail to see the
I « humor. Also, I used the word

make adrenaline swell your
veins.

Many students would not
have the nerve to get up in front
of the school and dance around
without the aid of a little barley
and hops.

Are the actions of drunk stu-
dents different than those of so-
ber ones? '

Absolutely.

But everyone——drunk or so-
ber-—was thoroughly entertained
(or appalled) by it.

Lip Synch is one of the few
“cool” activities at this school at
which attendance is not divided
down Greek lines. It’s also one
of the‘ few activities held by the
school that students actually at-
tend.

Sad as it is, alcohol brings us
together for this good cause. It
may not seem right, but taking
alcohol away‘from Lip Synch
would be the same thing as tak-
ing food out of those pantries.

The above editorial repre-
sents the majority opinion of The
Ring-Tum Phi editorial staﬁ‘I

exposed for good reason.
I When possible, you used the
person’s initials and home-
town. This makes it simple
for teachers, alums, or pap
ents who’re familiar with the
student to recognize them in
your article. If you feel.it’s
your journalistic duty to
keep our community abreast
of who got arrested then
keep at it, but I think you
might want to reconsider-
your section.
‘Laughing at the ex-
penseji of those who’re
awaiting punishment from
the school and county isn’t
journalism, it’s petty slander. ‘
If your aim is to reduce the
Phi to a tabloid, smearing
W&L students, so be it. But
you might want to seek coun-
se} of the former News Edi-
tors. The Phi used to pride '
themselves on being the se
rious, credible arm of stu-
dent pubs. As a former News
Editor for The Trident, I of-
ten struggled with how to fill ,
my section, some weeks
were just lean on -news.
However, I never resorted to

Rushing here, there

Pi Phi compares rush week at UVA té ours at W&L

By Kate Shellnutt
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s chapter
of Pi Beta Phi got a chance to see
another campus’ rush week when
they visited the University of Vir-
ginia Saturday for a mixer.

Unlike at W&L, UVA’s frater-
nity rush incorporates women,
whose formal recruitment there
ended the week before.

Because fraternities and sorori-
ties conduct recruitment during
separate weeks, UVA has no col-
lective celebration analogous to
W&L’s Tear Night.

At UVA, fraternity rush takes
place over two weeks and is di-
vided into three rounds of invita-
tions. Fratemitics will invite rush-
ees to “a series of formal events,”
including dinners, date functions
and mixers.

“Girls will have to dress up as
and go to ‘invites’ with their boy-
friends or guy friends.” said Missy

Jenkins, a UVA sophomore. “On
top of wonying about what frater-
nities you’re going to, ﬁnding a
date seems to be additionally
stressful for the freshmen rush-
ing.”

Despite this stress, freshmen
and upperclassmen fraternity
members enjoy the date aspect.

“Everyone gets really excited,”
said Zach Roth, :1 UVA second-
year and one of Chi Psi’s rush
chairs.

He helped organize the mar-
riage-themed mixer between his
fraternity and Pi Phi.

In contrast to the separate re-
crultment activities for men and
women at W&L, the visiting Pi
Phis immediately noticed differ-
ences in the party-oriented rush
process at UVA.

“It didn’t even seem like rush.
There was no Visible difference
between the guys that were rush-
ing and the brothers,” said Jill
Roper, sophomore. “Yeah, it

shows the true side of the frater-
nity, but it also seems to use girls
to bribe. freshmen.”

Roper continued to explain
how this system may be “unique
to UVA.” *

“At W&L,. we have Homecom-
ing, we have Christmas Weekend,
we have tons of mixers, so rush
shouldbe rush,” she said. “I think
it would be difficult to do rush like
this because of all the people who
rush as freshmen here.”

Not only does UVA have 31
IFC fraternities, but also, only
30% of the freshman population
goes through rush.

Despite differences in popula-
tion, Pi Phi sophomore Jamie

Ferrell said the UVA Greek scene
.had a familiar feel. A

“Walking around Charlottes-
ville, you see all these kids walk-
ing to fraternity houses, just like
in Lexington,” she said. “The
mixer with Chi Psi was just so
much fun.”

Dropped at the door

High percentage of Greek participation increases exclusivity

SORORITY RUSH STATISTICS

By Jessica Shaw
REPORTER

During rush, freshman girls
have 45 minutes to sell their ap-
pearance, charm and personality
to hundreds of upperclass girls.
Enticing videos, ridiculous skits
and inﬁnite sorority songs leave
girls torn between friends, team-
mates and morals.

As each girl makes the long
trek back across the footbridge,
thoughts of insecurity, rejection
and dread overtake them. In a
matter of days, they will ﬁnd out
their future in Greek life, a com-
munity comprised of 76 percent

of women on this campus.

With such a com-

manding presence at

Washington and Lee,

certain expectations
and stereotypes ac-
company this organiza-
tion. This year, only 82
percent of women who
registered ended up
pledging a sorority. The re-
maining women were either
rejected or withdrew.

“I strongly think that Greek
life isn’t for everybody,” said As-
sistant Director of Student Activi-
ties and Greek Life Kristen
Powell. “Our campus Greek life
is extremely inclusive. To have 76
percent participation rate is al-
most unheard of.”

Powell also said that this high
percentage brings with it negative
aspects. Women not affiliated
with a sorority are more likely to
feel out of place.

Several freshman girls were
interviewed for this article. They
all wished to remain anonymous
due to the sensitve nature of pub-
licizing these comments.

“It creates and reinforces the
high school cliques and social
boundaries [that] institutions
such as the speaking tradition are
meant to break down,” a fresh-
man girl said.

Some women said they never
would have considered a soror-
ity at a larger university. Because
of its dominant presence at W&L,
some said it was almost unavoid-
able.

“I hadn’t given rush a lot of

thought before it actually began‘

those first couple of weeks of
winter term,” a freshman girl
said. “But, I thought that since

Greek life was something most
people were involved in, I would
naturally go along with it.”
During rush week, women
visit each of the five sorority
houses. At the end of the night,
women rank them according to

preference, and the sororities do

the same for the women.

“The girls were sweet, and it
was fun to see some people I
don’t get to see very often,” a
freshman girl said. “It is weird to
me, though, that those girls I
talked to at rush had a different
agenda than merely talking to me.

“At that moment, they were
seeing if I fit in; if I was some-
one they wanted.”

In the fall, each freshman hall
was assigned a Rho Gamma.
These girls assisted freshmen
during the recruitment process
and provided emotional support.
Powell also met with freshmen
who needed extra advice.

“One of my roles is to be that
guidance counselor to help them
develop their leadership skills
and personal skills,” she said.

keeping an open mind going into
rush. Powell said the Panhellenic
Council emphasized the fact that
nobody has a normal recruitment
process.

“I think rush puts a lot of pres-
sure on girls, although I don’t
think I would say it is all nega-

' tive,” Rho Gamma Laura Byme

said. “Overall, I think rush is a
great experience for girls to meet
each other, but I definitely see the
pressure building as the week
goes on.”

This aside, many students
found this advice tough.

“While freshmen are encour-
aged not to go in with precon-
ceived ideas about the various so-
rorities, sororities go in with a
clear and distinct idea of what
they want,” a freshman girl said.
“With many of the sororities, this
idea is based on superficial char-
acteristics.” '

Ethnic diversity is also an is-
sue with sororities at W&L.
Powell said she would like to see
a better representation and see
students actively seeking
changes.

“I wish they were a little more
dissatisfied with some things,”
she said. “I think our students

_I accept some things because they

have always been done that way.

There are things our students
need to challenge and improve. I
would love to see our sororities
be morerepresentative of our
campus.”

Though larger universities
may boast a smaller Greek per-
centage, many students feel this
scenario is an even stronger pres-
sure.

This year, just over ten percent
of those registered did not join a
sorority. This number, however,
is relative to a small student
population.

“The exclusivity of it bothers
me,” a freshman girl said.

“I just don’t like that it has the
potential to hurt girls, and it
makes the girls going through
rush think that they have to mea-
sure up to something. Obviously,
I know a bunch of Greek girls,
and they are such great people. I
love the girls, I just don’t like the
system.”

DUIS
on the
decline

 

Drunk driving rates
have gone down among
students at Washington and
Lee, according to the stu-
dent health center’s annual
health survey.

Though an alarming
number of students, 25 per-
cent of those surveyed, re-
ported driving drunk in the
last year, W&L actually has
a student drunk driving rate

' that is five percent lower
than the national collegiate
average. I ~

“DUI numbers seem to
be dropping, which I’m

, pleased about,” said Lex-
ington Police Chief Bruce
Beard, “but we’re still con-
cerned about the issue.”

According to statistics
compiled by Mike Young,
director of Campus Secu~
rity, eighteen students have
been arrested in each of the
last three school years,
while 23 were arrested dur-
ing the 2001-2002 session.
Of the 77 arrests, fourteen
were laws students and the
rest were undergraduates.

“DUIS by our students
and the time spent by local
police dealing with them
have diminished consider-
ably,” Young said. “Eigh-
teen during a school year is
just two a month, and when
you consider that we have
about two thousand‘ stu-
dents partying three times
a week for thirty weeks,
eighteen arrests isn’t too
bad.” I _

K , However. if the
university’s student health
survey accurately records
the behavior of W&L
undergrads, approximately
400 students have drove
drunk during the last
‘ twelve months. Only four
percent of them were
caught by Lexington police
ofﬁcers. i

W&L’s strike system
also appears to show more
responsible drinking be

New Greeks strive for change

Historically black fraternities and sororities and SigEp take a diﬁerent view on Greek life

By Sarah Kientz
REPORTER

Five organizations are work-
ing to attract diversity and prove
that not all Greek life revolves
around the keg.

Assistant Dean of Students
Tammy Futrell is the adviser for
all the historically black orga-
nizations that have chapters on
campus, which includes the fra-
ternities Alpha Phi Alpha and
Phi Beta Sigma and the sorori-
ties Delta Sigma Theta and Al-
pha Kappa Alpha.

According to Futrell, the his-
torically black Greek organiza-
tions are fairly new on campus.

“Last year at this time we had
no Greek letter organizations of
this type on campus, so we’re
sort of going through the grow-
ing pains right now,” Futrell
said. “It’s a new thing for stu-
dents of color and for the cam-
pus overall.”

Futrell said historically black
fraternities and sororities began
on a national level to provide a

support base for African Ameri-
can students.

“These organizations were
started at a time when African
Americans were not welcomed
into majority organizations,”
Futrell said. “They offered sup-
port and friendship, and are not
as focused on the social aspect
but on community service and on
bettering the lives of others.”

Futrell also pointed out the
benefit of historically black
Greek organizations as draws for
minority students to consider
Washington and Lee.

“It’s a great recruiting tool for
students of color because they
have relatives and parents in
these organizations,” Futrell
said. “It’s something they can
identify with and an opportunity
for them to join.”

Senior Ted Archer of Phi Beta
Sigma said he and his fraternity
brothers are trying to establish
themselves this year through
community service.

“Since this is our ﬁrst full year
of existence at W&L, it makes

sense that the other Greeks are
given more attention. The Greek
system has been a part of this
school for a long time,” he said.
“I think the hard work that we
put into trying to offer something
positive and beneficial to the

“We have to be care-
ful not to treat black
Greeks as some sort
of ‘other’ category.”

TED ARCHER, CLASS OF 2006

W&L community will speak for
itself.”

According to Archer, mem-
bers of Phi Beta Sigma currently
volunteer at Maury River Middle
School and Natural Bridge twice
a month. The fraternity also
hopes to organize two other func-
tions in 2006, including a W&L

Talent Show in February and a

White Party in April where they
“hope to invite other Greeks
from close by colleges and uni-
versities.”

Archer said historically black
fraternities differ from the larger
fraternities on campus in that in-
volvement extends far past the
college experience.

“The main focus of most other
Greeks is your four—year college
career. For black Greeks, your
commitment to your organiza-
tion lasts most people their en-
tire lives because of regional
conferences, Graduate Chapters
and Distinguished Service Chap-
ters and so on,” Archer said.

“The rich history of black
Greeks, being that there are only
nine really notable ones, truly
makes them extraordinary when
you think of some of the people
who were black Greeks. People
from Dr. Martin Luther King, to
Langston Hughes, to James
Weldon Johnson, to Emmit
Smith, to even Rick James,” he
said.

Overall, Archer said the more

attention given to historically
black Greek organizations, the
more they will become as widely
accepted as the other Greeks on
campus.

“I think more exposure and
more articles such as this one is
the direction that we should stay
in because historically black fra-
ternities and sororities are a part
of university life, a part of Ameri-
can culture, a part of our rich his-

tory as a country for that matter,” .

Archer said. “We have to be
careful not to treat black Greeks
as some sort of ‘other’ category.
There are some differences be-
tween black Greeks and other
Greeks but the fundamental prin-
ciples are all the same.”

Junior Jasmine Randolph,
president of the historically black
sorority Delta Sigma Theta, said
that, like Phi Beta Sigma, the
focus of her sorority is on com-
munity service.

Greek options added

CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1

Theta are currently involved
in a tutoring and mentoring pro-
gram with Highland Park Mag-
net School in Roanoke.

According to Randolph, the
girls will be working with the
Roanoke Alumnae chapter of
DST on several of their national
service projects.

These projects include Delta
GEMS (Growing and Empower-
ing Myself Successfully), a pro-
gram targeted at preparing teen-
age African American girls for
college, and Delta Academy, a
tutoring and mentoring program
aimed at African American girls
in middle school.

Randolph wishes more atten-
tion were given to the histori-
cally black fraternities and so-
rorities.

“I feel as if the historically
black Greek organizations are
often overlooked,” she said.

“I think we really need to fo-
cus on making more people
aware of our existence on cam-
pus and letting them know what
these organizations are about.”

Randolph and two other
W&L students are involved in
the Tau Omega chapter of Delta
Sigma Theta, which is a joint
chapter between students at
W&L, Roanoke College and
Hollins University.

The chapter was chartered in

V April 2005, and Randolph hopes

that in the future Delta Sigma
Theta will become more local-
ized on W&L’s campus.

“I hope that Delta Sigma
Theta will grow in numbers on
W&L’s campus in the future and
will be more widely known
about on campus,” Randolph
said.

“I also hope that W&L will
be able to attain their own chap-
ter of DST that is not joint with
other schools, [and that] we will
be able to become more in-

volved with the current Greek
system.”

Like Archer, Randolph noted
the difference between histori-
cally black fraternities and the
more popular Greek system on
campus in that black organiza-
tions stress the lifetime conunit—
ment of being involved in ser-
vice.

“A major difference is that
our sorority ties last a lifetime,”
Randolph said. “We still partici-
pate in the sorority even after
graduating from college and be-
cause of this we have a huge net-
working basis.”

The historically black soror-
ity Alpha Kappa Alpha is also
beginning its own chapter at
W&L.

Sophomores Yvonne Coker,
Jessica Hopper and Quiana
McKenzie are currently in-
volved in establishing a charter
here and hoping to begin the
sorority next year.

“I’ve always admired women
I knew in AKA and saw them as
hardworking, proud, outstand-
ing black women and have as-
pired to be one,” Coker said.

Coker added that Futrell and
Director of Campus Activities
Margo McClinton, both mem-
bers of AKA, have helped in-
spire the girls to continue their
efforts to establish the sorority.

Right now, Coker, Hopper
and McKenzie are focusing on
the ﬁve target areas the president
of the national AKA program
has spearheaded.

These goals include educa-
tion, the black family, health, the

economy and the arts.

The girls are currently in-
volved in community service
through Roanoke’s Beta Chi
Omega graduate chapter of
AKA.

Coker said that she is pleased
with the attention AKA has re-
ceived thus far from members of
the W&L community.

“I think awareness is being
raised, lots of questions are be-
ing asked and lots of people are
curious about AKA and the other
historically black fraternities and
sororities,” Coker said. “It’s
opened up dialogue and made
people aware of our service and
activities and are taking us more
seriously because we do want to
collaborate with other Greek life
to create a community on cam-
pus.”

Sigma Phi Epsilon (SigEp) is
also returning to campus as a dif-
ferent breed of fraternity.

According to senior Drew
Davenport, SigEp is re-coloniz-
ing at W&L after its three-year
absence.

“We’re trying to return to
W&L as a fraternity that focuses
on the fundamentals of what
frats should be about,” he said.

This includes a “sound mind
and sound body under the Bal-
anced Man program,” Daven-
port said.

“On a national level, SigEp
is trying to eliminate the ‘frat
boy’ image of Animal House.
We’re not a drinking club. We’re
focused on sharing the ideals of

' being well-balanced and well-

rounded,” he said.

Although Davenport hopes
SigEp will not be viewed as an
Animal House type of fraternity,
he also stressed that the frat will
host campus-wide activities.
“We’re not a dry fraternity, and
we’re not prohibited from hav-
ing alcohol,” Davenport said,
“but we’re not going to squash
money on parties.”

Davenport said some of the
activities SigEp has already
planned include etiquette parties
with the sororities, swing-danc-
ing lessons and art museum vis-
its.

He added that he hopes mem-
bers of the W&L community will
accept SigEp’s philosophy, al-
though it may take time.

Davenport said the W&L
chapter of SigEp needs to earn
back its charter by gaining mem-
bers and doing certain activities
in order to prove that they will
abide by the Balanced Man phi-
losophy.

Although SigEp currently has
11 members, Davenport says
they will not regain the charter
until next year.

Freshman Taylor Embury is
one of the seven freshmen plan-
ning to join SigEp.

Embury said he saw SigEp as
a middle ground between being
independent and joining one of
the more popular fraternities.

“I felt that with other fratemi—
ties you were trying to fit your-
self into a mold, and I likedthe
idea of starting from scratch
[with SigEp],” Embury said.

“Everybody feels they have to
give into the traditional fraternity
image or be independent, but we
want to be a middle ground,” he
said.

These organizations realize
that the social scene will be dif-
ficult to change, but they are
working to give students a
choice.

BEHIND
BARS

Here is the latest

update on who ran

afoul of the law during the last few
weeks. News editor Jacob Geiger took a
peek at this weekk police reports to see

what you ’ve been up to.

Lip-synch gone bad
Many freshmen enhance
their dancing skills at Lip
Synch with some alcohol.
Dana Statton,
unfortunately, didn’t quite
make it all the way home.
Instead she was arrested
near campus and charged
with DIP and underage
possession of alcohol.
Since Lip Synch is all for a
good cause, maybe the
judge will let her off light.

That makes three
issues in a row

For the third time in as
many weeks, Behind Bars
features the Lexington
labyrinth, better known as
one—way streets. This
week’s victim ran afoul of
the maze while sober.
W&L student Alex
Duckworth was ticketed at
3:01 a.m. last Sunday
morning for the by now
routine offense of driving
the wrong way on a one-
way street. Is Behind Bars
missing something here?
Has someone gone and
ripped down all of the one-
way signs in the city? Or
does the problem start with
the city itself? Why is
Preston Street a one-way
for one block? We think
the man is trying to keep us
down.

Headlights return

to haunt

While the Lexington Police
Department issued 53 DUI
citations last year, DUIDs
are far rarer. The acronym
means “Driving While
Under the Inﬂuence of
Drugs,” and Adam
Stubbleﬁeld was arrested
for just that on Dec. 1. As
is so often the case,
Stubbleﬁeld was betrayed
by his darkened headlights
as he drove around at 2:30
a.m. When the smoke
cleared, the twenty-two
year old was charged with
a DUID, driving without
headlights and the
possession of marijuana.

Family affair

On Dec. 9, Lexington
police solved the theft of a
Toshiba laptop and a set of
stereo speakers. The items
had been stolen from an
apartment on East
Washington Street on Nov.
22. Brandon Southers,
Paul Southers and Earl
Montgomery, who range in
age from 18 — 22 years,
were each arrested and
charged with one count of
grand larceny and one of
burglary. The Southers
brothers live in Lexington.
Montgomery’s address was
not listed in the arrest
docket. I

haviors. Though the num-
ber of ﬁrst strikes issued last
year, 129', was the highest
total over the last four years,
the number of second
strikes issued has fallen
from 14 during 2001-2002
to just one last year.

Both Young and Beard
credited the Traveller
shuttle system for cutting
downdrunkdriving. “Trav-
eller is available through
reasonable hours, and that’s
had an impact on the drop
in drunken driving rates,”
Young said.

“We really want to thank
the staff and students over
at W&L for the programs
they’ve put in place,” Beard
added. “They’ve worked
out very well, and I hope the
programs can continue.”

W&L’s Traveller pro-
gram has been student-run
since it began operation.
The group’s steering com-
mittee is currently led by
senior Katelyn Giarratana.

, ,C,urrently, Traveller of-W
fers two services: dispatch"
V and express. The expfess”
' service consists of four

shuttle buses that follow a
set route from 10:00 pm.
until 2:00a.m. on Wednes-
day, Friday, and Saturday
nights. The buses follow a
set route that visits the
freshmen dorms, the frater-
nity and sorority houses and
several popular off campus
party sites such as Windfall
Hill and the Pole Houses.

'l‘raveller’s dispatch sys-
tem operates seven nights a
week; dispatch drivers will
take people to houses not on
the regular bus route or pro-
vide transit when the buses
are not running.

Beard’s department
made 53. DUI arrests last
year, an average of between
four and ﬁve a month. Lex-
ington officers made ﬁve ar-
rests during December and
three in January. The
Rockbridge Country
Sheriff’s office reported
making 60 DUI arrests dur-
ing that same time span.

Beard, whose depart-
ment receives state grants
for DUI enforcement, said
that every winter
Lexington’s officers partici-
pate in a statewide drunk
driving crackdown called
“Safe, Smart and Sober.”

The program, which runs
from mid—Noven1ber until
January, is designed to dis-
courage dmnk driving dur-
ing the holiday season.

According to the Na-
tional Highway Traffic
Safety Administration
(NHTSA), Virginia had 925
driving death in 2004. Of
those deaths, 39 percent in-
volved at least one person
with aBAC greater than .02,

and 33 percent involved at ..

least one person with a BAC
above the legal limit of .08.
Further contributing to the
problem is the fact that more

A than half of the people

killed in Virginia accidents
were not wearing a seat belt.

’ fatal" accidents involve at

DUI arrest
rates drop  

least one person who has a

1982 60 percent of fatal ac-
cidents made the same
claim.

While total auto—related
fatalities in Virginia have
remained constant over the
last thirty years, their fre-
quency has diminished.
While 1975 saw 2.87 deaths
per million miles traveled in
Virginia, 2004 statistics re-
ported a ratio of only 1.17
deaths per million miles.

Though W&L students
drive drunk far less often
today than they did ten years
ago, undergraduates and
law students still receive
DUIs each year.

Aside from the legal.

ramifications associated
with a DUI conviction, stu-
dents also face action from
the Student Judicial Coun-
cil (SJC). Though SJC
guidelines suggest a suspen-
sion for students convicted
of charges, over the last
two years the council has
chosen alternative punish-
ments-. ,M°s.t DUI punish-
ments_liave_  a strike
—— sometimes with the fine,
sometimes without ~ social
and conduct probation and
between 100-200 hours of
community service. Some-
times the SJC requires that
a certain portion of the
hours be completed inside
Rockbridge County.

In at least two cases last
year, the SJC was forced to
deal with a senior only
weeks away from gradua-
tion. In both incidents the
council assessed 150 hours
of community service while
requesting that the adminis-
tration withhold the
student’s diploma and deny
him/her the right to walk at
graduation.

Though the SIC has sug-
gested guidelines for pun-
ishment, the council consid-
ers every case individually
and decides on an appropri-
ate punishment. Some stu-
dents also choose to with-
draw after DUI charges, so
the SJC does not see every
case involving drunk driv-
ing. _.

Almost every year the
SJC also hears cases where

underage students have i,

been arrested for driving
with a BAC between .01
and .08. The council has
usually found those students
not guilty of drunk driving
but guilty of violating the
university’s alcohol poli-
cies.‘ Those students are
usually assessed a strike and
a smaller amount of com».
munity service.
Thoughthe S.lC’s DUI

caseload has remained rela- . ’

tively constant over the last
four years, Beard and Young

both feel.that‘W&L students’
aregfinally getting the mes-B 

sage about drunk driving
and taking advantage of

safer means of transporta-.

tion.
“I remember 15 years

ago DUI rates around here 2

were twice what they are

_ now.” Beard said. “Stu-
dents really seem to bedo-, .

ing a good job this year.”

Invitational

By Mike Fahey
STAFF WRITER

It’s been a record setting
week for the Washington and
Lee women’s basketball
team.

Last week, the girls de-
feated Emory and Henry,
scoring a school—record 89
points.

The Roanoke game see-
sawed throughout the first
half, and the Generals found
themselves down by two at
the start of the second half.

After Roanoke went on a
10-0 run in the ﬁrst six n1in—
utes, W&L stepped up its play
and came back to take the

lead with nine minutes left.

Roanoke kept the game close
until the ﬁnal minutes, trailing by
only one point with 1:28 left.

In the ﬁnal 1:05 of the game,
freshman guard Bethany
Ridenhour iced the win, hitting
ﬁve of six free throws in the last
minute.

Senior center Jessica
Hunsinger became just the sixth
General to reach the 1,000 point
mark, scoring a team-high 23
points in the win.

Senior guard Louisa Feve
added a season—high 21 points.
Feve also led the team in assists
with six.

Feve was excited about defeat-
ing Roanoke for the ﬁrst time in

Records fall in b-ball

Women’s basketball moves up in ODAC standings with key victories

school history, saying, “It was an
awesome win.”

Hunsinger said, “In all honesty,
the reason why the E&H game had
a record setting score was a direct
result of Emory and Henry’s style
of playing. They play a very fast
paced game with quick
shots which allows for more pos-
sessions and thus more scoring.”

Hunsinger was pleased with
the team’s play, saying, “The fact
that we were able to keep up with
their pace is respectable. We also
played pretty good defense which
kept them below their 86.6 scor-
ing average per game.”

Another school record was set
when W&L had three players
notch double—doubles.

Feve scored 16 points to go
along with her 10 rebounds and
six assists. Hunsinger added 15
points, 15 rebounds and seven
blocks.

Feve said, “Our season has
had some ups and downs, but
things seem to be going pretty
well right now. Hopefully these
games mark the start of lots of
wins to come.”

Hunsinger echoed her feel-
ings, saying “This season has
had its rough points but we
have been working extra hard
off.

“I have high hopes for the
next six games and have full
confidence that we can win
every single one of them,” she
said.

Lax looks
promising

Women’s lacrosse ranked sixth in pre-season

By Elliott Walker
surr warren

The women’s lacrosse team
posted their best season in school
history last year. They had an
overall record of 15-4, 8-0 for con-
ference games, won their third
straight ODAC title and won their
first-ever NCAA tournament
game. The team was ranked 13 in
the nation by Lacrosse Magazine is
preseason poll.

Unfortunately, not all the news
is good.

The team lost eight starters
from last season. Some wonder
if that loss will hinder the team’s
performance this year, but it
doesn’t seem to faze this team in
the least. Our goals are the “same
as every year,” said junior Avery
Lovejoy. She and team captain
Kate Lester said the team’s goal
is to win ODACs again and get
even further in the NCAA touma-
ment than last year.

“That would be spectacular,”
said she.

The team has four returning all-
ODAC performers from last sea-
son, two of which serve as cap-
tains alongside Lester. Amanda
Strickler and Rachel Wallick, con-
sidered to be offensive and defen-
sive powerhouses, respectively,
were both chosen for ﬁrst team
honors. Strickler and Wallick are
two of 18 returning players. “The
diversity of players who are scor-
ing threats this year is at an un-
precedented high level,” said

Strickler. The team has also
gained six freshmen.

“This year has a lot of poten-
tial,” Lester said. The team plans
to play several out of conference
games against some of the top-
ranked Division III teams. “Will-
iams is always a big one,” said
Lovejoy.

They’re ranked sixth by La-
crosse Magazine. In addition, the
team will tackle other nationally
ranked opponents St. Mary’s,
Franklin & Marshall and Colorado
College, one of the final four
teams in 2005.

Playing some of the best
schools in D—HI lacrosse is some-
thing that Lester says makes the
team stronger.

Lovejoy also mentioned that
the team has added several Divi-
sion I drills to their practice rou-
tine to up their level of play.

The team also boasts extreme
team unity. “If everyone decides
to pick it up as a team, then the
results are much easier to come
by,” Sarah Tilbor, a sophomore,
said.

Their ability to work so well
together is something Strickler
believes has enabled the team to
win ODACS for the past three
years.

The women’s lacrosse team
isn’t planning on going anywhere
but up this season. Their first
game is scheduled for Saturday,
Feb. 25 at St. Mary's. Their first
home game will follow on
Wednesday, March 1.

“If everyone decides to pick it up as a team,

then the results are much easier to come by.”

Outlook bright as opening day nears

Baseball team looks to build on previous successﬁil years

By Tom Bush
STAFF WRITER

Expectations are high for this
year’s baseball team. The Gener-
als are coming off a 27—win sea-
son, one short of a school record,
and are returning with nearly ev-
ery starter. The Generals failed to
win the ODAC tournament, fall-
ing to Hampden-Sydney and
Lynchburg in the semiﬁnals.

“This year our goal is to win
the [ODAC] tournament, and
move into NCAA play,” says se-
nior outﬁelder and team captain
Dave Mackenzie. “Anything less
would be a disappointment.”

The Generals return an excep-
tional pitching staff. The rotation
is led by junior right-hander
Clayton Edwards. Edwards com-
piled an 8-4 record last season,
with a 2.52 ERA in 71 innings.

“He was huge for us last year,”
says junior outfielder/second
baseman David Miller.

Behind Edwards is a pair of
southpaws, junior Johnson
Brownlow and sophomore John
Parker. Brownlow was second on
the team in innings pitched and
strikeouts, throwing 56.1 frames
and blowing away 40 batters.
Parker, despite a sub—75 MPH
fastball, found success during his
freshman season with excellent
control, walking just three batters

in nearly 52 innings.

In addition, says Mackenzie,
“We need our young sophomore
pitchers to become more mature
and fulﬁll leadership roles on the
team.”

The sophomores he is referring
to include Tim Livingston, Steve
Marcott, Myke Mulhem and Jeff
Pharis, a group which will be ex-
pected to solidify the bullpen and
consistently close out games.

“Marcott and Livingston were
two guys who showed ﬂashes last
year and could, end up ﬁlling (a
closing) role,” said junior out-
ﬁelder Richard Garland.

The Generals will also count
on what Edwards calls an “ar-
mada” of freshmen pitching, in-
cluding right—handers Brendan
Clark, Andrew Henderson and
Chris Sherwin.

Junior catcher Jordan Wesley
believes the pitching staff will
“have to lead us through the tough
games.”

The Generals’ lineup will also
look very familiar to a year ago.
Gone is catcher Xak Bausch and
third baseman Adam Bullock, but
replacements Wesley and Edwards
(when not pitching), should have
little problem ﬁlling their shoes.
Wesley hit .347 with 30 RBIs a
year ago, starting 32 games at
catcher and designated hitter.

“I’ll have to play solid behind

the plate,” says Wesley, “It’s some-
thing I’ve directed most of my fo-
cus to.”

Also returning to the lineup are
seniors Mackenzie, Taylor
McConnell and Scott Gosselink,
as well as juniors Garland and
Miller.

First-basemen McConnell ex-
ploded last year, setting season
records for hits (67), doubles (24),
RBI (56) and total bases (114). His
.427 batting average and 7 home
runs were both team highs as well.
McConnell is expected to anchor
the lineup again this year. Miller
hit .391 in a school—record 161 at-
bats, and was a First team All-
ODAC selection his sophomore
year. Garland should continue to
provide power to the heart of the
lineup, as he hopes to build on the
success of last year (.326 BA/4
HR/30 RBI).

Gosselink, who hit .349 and
led the team in runs and stolen
bases a year ago, is expected to
move to second base this year. The
shift will open up room for junior
Ray Sweeney to play shortstop
and provide defensive help on the
left side of the inﬁeld.

“Ray will be one of, if not the
best fielding shortstop in the
ODAC,” stated Miller. Rounding
out the lineup is Mackenzie. He’ll
return to centerfield, where he
started all 40 games a year ago.

“There are no weaknesses,”
says a conﬁdent Edwards.

Now in his 20'“ season, Head
Coach Jeff Stickley is optimistic,
but says it is a little early to tell.

“We did lose a good catcher
and solid third baseman from last
year,” says Stickley, “But I feel
like the guys can step in and do a
good job.”

Stickley maintains that the
players’ experience and ability to
play several positions will be ex-
tremely positive attributes to this
year's team.

A three-time ODAC Coach of
the Year, Stickley has had enor-

 

mous success over the past seven
seasons, tallying a record of 158-
87. Players say that his laid back
attitude is a big reason why.

“He lets us play, because he
knows we can, but gets on us if
we let up any,” says Wesley, “It’s
a great environment and he keeps
the game fun, which is key at such
a demanding academic school.”

Garland agrees, saying, “He
trusts his players’ abilities, (and)
knows when he needs to do some-
thing to get us going.”

So how does the coach himself
attribute his great success?

“Certainly we have had good

players over the last several years,
and the attitude and work ethic has
regenerated itself from year to
year,” says Stickley, deﬂecting the
attention from himself. “As you
know, good players make good
coaches.”

The Generals kick off the sea-
son Feb. l3 against Piedmont in
Atlanta, Georgia. Despite a difﬁ—
cult non-conference schedule, the
Generals believe the lofty expec-
tations are justiﬁed.

“I think 30 wins is a reasonable
expectation from this team,” re-
marks Garland. Here’s to hoping
he’s right.

The word still makes
you blush.

And now, The Vagina
Monologues are coming.

Although views of
femininity have changed
positively in recent years,
society still has a long way
to go, according to a coali-
tion of students here at
Washington and Lee.
These students have been
rehearsing for perfor-
mances of the intemation—
ally acclaimed show The
Vagina Monologues, to be
performed later this week.

The Vagina Mono-
logues is part of an inter-
national campaign, known
as V-Day, to combat vio-
lence against women and
girls.

Stephanie Yost, Vice
President of the Women’s
Law Students Organiza-
tion (WLSO), has been
working since July to

‘The Vagina Monologues’ help students think

INSIDE THE

 

bring the show back to
campus in conjunction
with the campus—wide cel-
ebration of 20 years of
women at W&L.

The show consists of a
series of monologues by
playwright Eve Ensler,
that are performed at hun-
dreds of colleges around
the United States every
year.

WLSO sponsored the
first showing of the mono-
logues at W&L two years
ago. There are plans to
continue performances of
the show every other year,
according to Yost, who re-
cruited fellow law student
Kristal High to direct the
show.

Senior Kristine Holda
became involved in the
show through her interest
in theater and after finding
out that it was coming
back to campus early last
month. She saw the per-
formance as a sophomore
and became even more in-

trigued when she read the
monologues for class.
Each monologue fo-
cuses on a specific transi-
tive moment in the lives of
women. The monologues
have been described as
provocative and challeng-
ing because they address
women’s issues head on.
According to Holda,
“these monologues show
how delicately powerful
the female body, mind and
soul really are. . .when
women don’t understand
their own bodies or their
sexuality, that becomes a
deep personal problem.”
The cast and crew of

the show are very excited
to have the opportunity to
bring the show back to
campus. Third—year law
student Jillian DiLaura, di-
rector of the show two
years ago, said, “It’s very
easy to become isolated in
Lexington and forget
about other issues.” Those
involved are eager to chal-

 

lenge students to think and
to examine the way they
think about women and
how they should act.

“My hope is that audi-
ences here at W&L will
earnestly engage with the
show,” said assistant direc-
tor and second-year law
student Wes J arrell. “They
may find themselves re-
evaluating assumptions
they didn’t know they had,
and. . .the fact that they
have that dialogue within
themselves or with others
will make the show a suc-
cess.”

However, the show is
about more than just rais-
ing awareness; it is also
about raising money. Each
year V—Day picks a differ-
ent issue to fund and ad-
dress directly. The rest of
the money raised goes to

support local Women’s is-
sue efforts.

This year’s issue high-
lights the plight of “com-
fort women” exploited by
the Japanese military in
World War II.

The rest of the money
from the tickets and t-
shirts being sold in the
Commons will go to sup-
porting Safehome Systems
in Covington, Va.

WLSO is also collect-
ing supplies for Project
Horizon, an advocacy
group and shelter for
abused women and girls
here in Rockbridge
County.

“The show is really an
eye-opener and not really
what you expect it to be,”
said Holda. “It says all the
things that most women
are afraid to say.”

Performances will be in the Johnson Theater on Feb. 9 and 10
at 7 p.m. Tickets can be purchased in the Commons and at the
Law School Brief Stop from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. this week.

  The fall of the

house ofA lba

‘Alba’ selected
to showcase
the talents ‘of a
predominantly
female theater

department

By E.J. Boyer
STAFF WRITER

Although Washington and

Lee remains one of the few
universities in the nation

where male students outnum-

ber female students, there is
one place on campus that

most of the men avoid, and it

isn’t the srat houses. It is the
stage at the Lenfest Center.

The ratio of actresses to
actors on our campus is
“Nine or ten to one,” says
Thomas “T” Anderson, the
Theater Depa1tment’s Tech-
nical Director. That imbal-
ance presents a particular
challenge to the Theater De-
partment: finding plays with
mostly female roles.

That challenge is height-
ened, said Anderson, by the
fact that “modem drama
underserves women.”

Theater Professor Kim-
berly Jew says that Lenfest’s

current drama, The House of

Bernarda Alba, represents
that rare dramatic produc-

tion—a play featuring an all
female cast performing what
Jew, the director, calls
“meaty roles.”

The play, framed by death
and family conﬂict, turns on
the oppressive reign of the
widow Bernarda Alba over
her five daughters. After the
death of her husband,
Bemarda imposes an an
eight—year mourning period
on the household, forbidding
her daughters, aging towards
spinsterhood, to have any in-
teraction with men—even in
conversation. It is a lifestyle
they resent.

Although the play takes
place in a rural Spanish vil-
lage during the early 20th
century, the actresses are cos-
tumed in clothes from differ-
ent eras as a means of em-
phasizing what Jew calls the
“archetypal experience of
women.” Bernarda, the over-
bearing mother, is dressed in
full Victorian garments, in-
cluding a corset, to highlight
her oppressive, frozen-in-
time personality.

In the course of the play,
Bernarda’s daughters display
different degrees of rebellion
against their mother, which is
illustrated by their dress. The
oldest daughter, Angustias, is
the most inﬂuenced by her
mother, and dresses therefore
in “quasi-Victorian” clothes
that gives her a close resem-
blance to Bemarda. The sec-
ond daughter, Magdalena,
appears in empire—waist

dresses that were popular
around 1900. Bemarda’s
middle daughter, Amelia, is
costumed in ﬂapper—style
dresses, from the 1920’s that
feature dropped waistlines.
The fourth daughter,
Martirio, wears l930’s style
clothing. The youngest and
most rebellious daughter,
Adela, is placed in the
l950’s, on the edge of rock-
and roll, and even appears in
a bright green dress despite

her household’s strict moum— ‘

ing period. Costume designer
Jessica Miller said this cos-
tume scheme “showed that as
the characters got younger in
age, they also got younger in
time.”

Anderson suggests that the
costuming from different eras
illustrates a political point:
the “problems that women
suffer really haven’t .
changed.”

Jew touches on this in the
director’s note of the pro-
gram.

She wrote that the play
“presented the entirety of the
Women’s experience—her
youth, middle years, and ma-
turity—asking us to
consider. . .a society that 
twists and deforms the most

V basic human impulses and re-

lationships we possess.”

If it all sounds a bit like a
Gender’s Studies exercise, it
is not wholly the fault of the
Theater Department. Blame
it on the Lenfest—shy men of
W&L.

 A, Speak Week, a re-

Kathekon’s effort to in-

The organization no-

of cell phones, iPods and
student self-conscious-

the speaking tradition. It
planned Speak Week to

‘encourage students to

adhere to the tradition
despite these ‘changes in
campus culture.

. “I do think we have to

L be intentional in our ef-

forts to keep the speak-

‘ ing tradition alive,” said

Kathekon member
Meghan loss, senior.
“Of the many traditions
that make our campus
unique, it is among the
most important to pre-
serve.”

loss considered the
speaking tradition’s 213‘
century threats.

, “Especially since the
cellphone issue has
been brought up, I think
students are making a
concerted effort. . . when
they are walking and
talking on the phone,”
she said. “The iPod, on
the other hand, need-
lessly impedes ‘speak-
ing."’

Junior Laura Pekman
agreed. .

“Since I've bee
here, I haven ’t seen dras-
tic changes in the speak-
ing tradition—~the same
amount of people are on
cell phones, the "same
amount of people are

, rushing. It should be

better, but I don’t think
it’s on a decline,” she
said.

Although cell phones
and iPods are modern
phenomena, fear over
the speaking tradition’s
decline is not. The Ring-
tum Phi began printing
letters to the editor con-
cerning the status of the
speaking tradition as far
back as 1928.

At that time, an As- _

similation Committee
strictly enforced the
speaking tradition, along
with other established
practices like wearing
“freshmen caps,” dress-
ing up for class, and not
‘Walking on the lawn.
These traditions made
up the “honorable be-
havior” advocated by
President Robert E. Lee
the century before.

The committee of up-
perclassmen reported
and fined students who
did not comply. No such

. committee exists today,

but the responsibility of
upholding the speaking
tradition still relies on
upperclassmen. »

f“It would be awk-
ward if you forced
people to say hi,” said
sophomore Chony Lu.

a “Most peopie try to do

  peaking
 radition
still alive

Speak Week promotes courtesy

it, and I think that’s
enough to show the
school's friendliness.”
This friendliness can
help ease freshmen into
their first semester at
Washington and Lee.
“Being from the
north, any sort of speak-

ing tradition would‘

phase me for a while.
After visiting my friends
at other schools, I real-
ized how nice it is to
have the speaking tradi-
tion here,” said freshman
Shreya Durvasula.

No other institution
has a historically estab-
lished speaking tradition
comparable to W&L’s.
A 1941 Ring-tum Phi
editorial claimed the tra-
dition “helps make the
difference between two
schools like Washington
and Lee and the Univer-
sity‘of Virginia.”

Duke Univcrsity’s
student newspaper, The
Chronicle, even ran a
column last month advo-
cating the school adopt
a similar tradition.

“The much-admired
‘Speaking Tradition’ at
Washington and Lee
University was imple-

mented by Robert E. Lee - L
200 years ago and is still 7' S

upheld today,” writes
Jane Chang. “I hereby
officially propose we es-
tablish a speaking tradi-
tion of our own.”

The Student Recruit-
ment Committee finds
the speaking tradition’s
uniqueness a point of in-
terest for prospectives
on tours. It shows how
the school values com-
munity.

“(The speaking tradi-
tion] is a simple act but

one whose meaning and
value we should not un-
derestimate,” said late
President John W. Elrod
in his 1995 Inaugural
Address. “We are fortu-
nate, indeed privileged,
to live in such a commu-
nity where the dignity
and value of each person
is incarnated in commu-
nity—deﬁning traditions
and which calls upon
each of its members to
relate through them.”

For many, the exist-
ence of these values at
W&L will perpetuate the

practice of the speaking A

tradition.
“Every year,
doomsayers report that

the Speaking Tradition is _

dying away. Granted, it
is no longer strictly en-
forced, but this special
tradition has proved its
durability,” said writer
losh Manning in a 1990
Ring-tum Phi article.

“The faculty and stu-
dents make W&L what
it isacademically, the di-
verse variety of activities
make it what it is so-
cially, the Honor System
makes it what it is ethi-
cally. The Speaking Tra-
dition, however, makes
W&L a home.”

A journalistic approach

Like predecessors, the Phi uses truth to defend the reporting behind weekly news feature on student arrests

Recently, the Phi achieved
something most newspapers only
dream of.

People have been reading to
page two.

What they ﬁnd there, among
advertisements and secondary
news stories, is the truth.

The truth is, we are college
students who make mistakes.
Sometimes these mistakes result
in a ticket, or an arrest.

In our weekly news feature,
Behind Bars, we report brieﬂy
on local police reports——which,
more often than not, include
many student arrests.

Not only are these reports a
simple matter of public record,
which could be easily accessed
by any caring citizen, but also,
they contain something every

journalist hungers for: news.

In 1735, Andrew Hamilton
successfully argued truth as a
defense for this.

Today, many of the student
arrests could easily provide the
Phi with material for a front—page
news story.

Realizing the sensitivity to
social exposure on campus,
we’ve reduced them to second-
page briefs.

In an attempt to provide some
level of anonymity for embar-
rassed students, we also chose to
print only the students’ initials.
(You’ll notice we have begun
printing full names. This is based
on recent legal advice.)

There is a phenomenon—-or
should we say phobia?--at this
school: people pack their skel-

“The Phi did not drink six shots of

vodka and then try to drive home. You did those

things...the Phi is holding you responsible.”

etons neatly away in their clos-
ets, until the closet is full and the
stench is unbearable.

In short, you are afraid of the
truth.

A clause of our mission state-
ment, publshed Jan. 16, states our
desire to hold you accountable
for your actions--and we’re do-
ing just that.

Some students have ques-
tioned the journalistic integrity of
printing these news briefs.

True: the style of the briefs——

Police blotter supported by facts

To the Editor:

A letter in last week’s Phi
complained of the sassy com-
mentary attached to the police
briefs in “Behind Bars,” suggest-
ing that the writer of this weekly
feature would likely be ashamed
to show it to W&L’s journalism
professors.

We professors in Reid Hall
prefer to keep our judgments on
student publications quiet, out of
respect for their autonomy and
hoping for robust, uninhibited
student journalism. But I will say
that the writer of “Behind Bars”

has nothing to be ashamed of.
These items come from open
records, your basic police blot-
ter available for all to see — with
the full names of those charged
rather than the initials, which the
Phi chooses to use for some rea-
son.

It’s great to see actual report-
ing being done. As for the com-
mentary, of course this isn’t the
style of police—blotter news in a
typical newspaper. But the Phi
is a campus paper. This is fair
comment, perfectly legal and in
keeping with the broader tradi-

tions of journalism. I’d much
rather see attitude with good re-
porting than attitude without re-
porting, which seems to pre-
dominate in the weaker campus
papers across the land. And what
more important issue is there for
commentary, in the realm of stu-
dent life here, than the excessive
and underage drinking that ac-
counts for most of the semi-
anonymous student cases that

end up in “Behind Bars”?

How to stop assault

To the Editor:

I want to applaud the staff of
The Ring-tum Phi for openly
coming out in last week’s issue
and condemning the prolific
sexual assault that occurs on this
campus. Both papers have put
together informative articles on
the most recent statistics released
from the Health Surveys, but the
staff of The Ring-tum Phi took it
a step further, and it heartens me
to know that there are still people
on this campus who are willing to
show that they have a conscience.
There’s more to life than drinking
and hooking-up; there are some
severe problems that plague this
campus.

My only fear is that last week’s
Phi article will amount to nothing
more than fiery rhetoric,
effectively rousing our passions
for a short while, only to allow
them to wither into apathy once
more. In my three years here, I
have witnessed a conspicuous lack
of action on the part of students;

we are guilty of saying one thing,‘

but doing another, or more likely,
doing nothing. I want to issue a
challenge to every student on this
campus who feels passionately
about an issue: Put your money
where your mouth is. If, in this
instance, you are tired of hearing
about sexual assault and how
Washington and Lee consistently
experiences twice the usual
incidence of sexual assault, then
do something about it. We are

. fighting a culture that has for

decades not overtly supported, but
tacitly allowed this egregious
behavior to be perpetrated with
virtual impunity. Perhaps we want

to label this “tradition,” though I
hardly think anybody would want
to claim sexual assault as this
institution’s legacy. Regardless,
this is a learned behavior. Maybe
I’m just being hopeful and not
wanting to believe that this
university would admit an
inordinately high number of
sexual predators into its ranks, but
I think it’s hard to argue against
the assertion that the environment
of this school plays a signiﬁcant
role in creating problems such as
sexual assault. The question, then,

If you are tired of
sexual assualt and
its myriad of

problems, then do

something about it.
 

is how do we change things? The
answer, it seems to me, is a matter
of greater personal accountability.

First off, students must be
cognizant of their own actions,
especially in situations where
sexual assaults are most likely to
occur, namely at parties. Alcohol
is a contributing factor in a vast
majority of sexual assaults, and
this appears to be one of the
easiest problems to remedy. I’d
like to see more men and women
stand up for their friends at parties:
chastise them if they are too drunk
and about to make a stupid hook-
up, cock-block on all accounts,
resort to public humiliation if

necessary, but do whatever it takes
to keep your friends out of
potentially dangerous sexual
situations.

Secondly, students should
educate themselves about this
topic. Each year, the university
brings in speakers to talk about
these subjects, but frequently the
audience is sparse and ﬁlled with
the same people time and again.
Three times a year, Project
Horizon holds volunteer training
to prepare individuals who want
to volunteer at their shelter, and
this experience provides
invaluable information on the
issues of domestic, dating, and
sexual violence.

Lastly, get involved! If you
really are tired of sexual assault
and its myriad problems, then do
something about it. Men, join 1
in 4 and become an active member
in an organization that is working
hard to put an end to this problem.
Women, join SPEAK, a new
women’s group designed to
educate women about the issue of
sexual assault. Men and women
should look into the Gender
Relations Committee or LIFE, two
organizations that are also
working together to combat the
problems of sexual assault. There
is certainly no shortage of outlets
for positive action.

My point in this letter is to
show that words are often not
enough to precipitate change. It’s
time for students to follow up their
rhetoric with actions, and for those
actions to align with what is being
said, lest we become hypocrites.

Also true: this is a college
newspaper.

There are no children in our
audience. We don’t have to hold
your hand like a small child and

The “joumalistic integrity,”
then, comes from the acquisition
and publication of knowledge
which is pertinent to campus.

The original American news-

up. The Phi is not interested in

Undemocratic democracy

Palestinian politics need to escape tyrannical agenda of terrorism to gain power; reach peace in the Middle East

By Jennifer Sutton
C 0 L U M N IS T

In a world where radicalism
reigns, the election of the
politically-extreme Hamas comes
as no surprise.

With signs of stability after
riding the storm that ensued from
Israel’s disengagement plan in the
Gaza Strip, things ﬁnally begin to
look up for a region marked by
years of conﬂict and tragedy.

It seems wrong to point ﬁngers
at the Israelis for their recent
reforms and the Bush
administration’s road—map to
peace.

But this nice facade had no
role in repairing a defunct system
that had corrupted the Palestinian
people for years, the Fatah
Movement.

There have been various
historical issues with the land
(issues which have resulted in
overt aggression by the Arab
League on numerous occasions).

These problems in Gaza and
parts of the West Bank (which
began with Israeli acquisition in
1967) were exacerbated when
Clinton and Yitzhak Rabin, the
late Israeli Prime Minister,

“This undoubtedly corrupt terrorist

organization did something everyone else

failed to do: it recognized the

Palestinians’ domestic issues.”

JENNIFER SUTTON, CLASS OF 2009

revived the formerly ousted
revolutionary terrorist Yasser
Arafat from the outskirts of
Tunisia. ‘

Perhaps they felt compelled to
find a fitting leader for the
Palestinian people. Instead, for
lack of better options, they aimed
at converting a bona-fide terrorist
whose prior claim to fame was the
head of the Palestinian Liberation
Organization (PLO).

This organization was
comprised to wreak havoc on
Israelis world-wide until they
became extinct or were thrown
into the sea, which ever came first.

In retrospect, this decision was
clearly erroneous.

At the time world leaders felt

that Arafat’s secular outlook was
a comparable neutralizer to
Hamas’ radically religious
fundamentalism.

My objective here is not to
criticize Clinton because Rabin
held an equally responsible role in
Arafat’s revival.

It is important to take note that
Clinton’s administration did little
to mitigate the harm caused by
Arafat’s anival.

There were the much-touted
Oslo Accords, which failed
miserably, due in part to Arafat’s
refusal to take the steps necessary
to achieve peace.

This deal resulted in Ehud
Barak offering an obscene amount
of land and Arafat blatantly

rejecting it, which resulted in the
second intifada.

Then of course, there was
Hilary Clinton’s infamous gaffe
where she kissed a corrupt Suha
Arafat who had just accused
Israelis of poisoning the milk of
Palestinian babies.

No one, not the world
community or the US held, Arafat
or Fatah accountable for their
behavior.

Thus, there is no doubt that
prior presidential administrations
and world-leaders played a role in
reviving the terrorists whose wide-
spread corruption was a catalyst
for Hamas’ recent win.

Instead of attempting to aid the
Palestinian people who he claims
to have fought for, Arafat spent
years funneling aid money, meant
to feed and educate impoverished
children and rebuild infrastructure
in war-tom parts of the West Bank
and Gaza, to his family and their
cronies.

While Suha lived the high-life
on the Charnps—Elysee, millions of
Palestinians remained without
proper health-care or aid.

Yet one is forced to ask where
the UN, America and the Western
world were during those
formidable years.

Nowhere in sight evidently
because there was clearly no
regulation of the billions of dollars
being sent to the corrupt PLO,
who was quickly siphoning it
away.

Ironically, the only people
who allegedly seemed to ‘help’
these forgotten people was
Hamas, a militant Islamic group
whose primary objective is to
destroy the state of Israel.

They provided health-care,
education, summer-camps and
other forms of infrastructure to the
Palestinian people.

These summer-camps teach
children to throw grenades, glorify
and encourage martyrdom, and
employ textbooks which neglect
to recognize the existence of Israel

Furthermore, they promote
rampant propaganda and anti-
Seinitism, implying they too had
an agenda.

This undoubtedly corrupt
terrorist organization did
something everyone else failed to
do: it recognized the Palestinians
domestic issues and sought to
effectively fix their welfare.

Unfortunately, for Abbas and
Bush’s sake, their time to reign
came far too late. Bush, who
would not deal with Arafat, and

Abbas, who was the first
Palestinian leader to make actual
strides on the road—map to peace,
when presented with huge road-
blocks, did too little, too late.

Now the tables have shifted
from the optimism that beset the
region only months earlier. Hamas
is now running the show, Fatah is
officially defunct, Bush is
continuing to promote democracy
in regions where radicalism
prevails and Ariel Sharon is
essentially comatose after
revamping Israeli politics. Is there
any way to rectify the major
mistakes of the past?

The Westem—world is ﬁnally
trying, after years of criticizing the
Israelis (excluding America) and
sitting on the sidelines taking jabs
at the Prime Ministers of Israel.

The Big Four have agreed to
freeze aid to the region until
Hamas revamps its political
charter, but this is only a first step
in fixing the issue.

This is a wake-up call to the
Fatah movement, showing them
that their war-lord ways have
reached an end, and it is time to
either step up to the plate or allow
radicalism and propaganda to ruin
whatever hope is left in the
region.

The hidden heroes

With little fanfare at home, university alumni serve in Iraq and Afghanistan

Bylessica Shaw
REPORTER

CNN blares monotonously in
the Commons as more updates
from Iraq and the ongoing quest
for Osarna ﬂash across the screen.
In this comfortable haven of Lex-
ington, it is easy to dismiss this
repetitive ‘drab’ from the anchor-
man as irrelevant. What many stu-
dents do not realize is courageous
Washington and Lee alums risk
their lives daily in this dangerous
War on Terror.

“Never in my wildest Law
School dreams could I have imag-
ined that one day I would be in
western Afghanistan wearing
twenty pounds of body armor, car-
rying an M4 carbine, a 9mm pis-
tol, a hand grenade, signal mirror
and various other accouterrnents
of war,” Bill Abernathy, ’8l, said.
“Yet here I am, about 70 miles
from the Iranian border, doing just
that.”

Abernathy is one among many
alumni who currently serve in the
United States Military or National
Guard. An Army Lieutenant Colo-
nel, he presently leads a team as
Army Chief of Embedded Train-
ers stationed in western Afghani-
stan. He said the mission of his
unit is to train the Afghanistan
National Army (ANA), to effec-
tively control violence and to se-
cure the safety of the nation.

“Any political scientist will tell
you that you cannot just brew up
democracy,” he said. “It has to
simmer and steep for decades.”

Recently, Abemathy’s unit suc-
cessfully maintained peace during
the parliamentary and presidential
elections. He said this was a big

step in the democratic direction. I

Despite significant improve-
ments, Abernathy said there re-
main many obstacles involving
living conditions.

“[Afghanistan has] hand-
pumped wells, open ditches that
carry water and waste and abject
poverty, where neither running
water not electricity is taken for
granted,” he said. “Afghanistan
truly is where the 21“ century
meets 100 B.C.”

Abernathy assumes many po-
sitions aside from military leader.
He said he often assists children
with their English skills.

“The English classes are seg-
regated by gender, and the teacher
poignantly said that, for girls,

Lt. Colonel Abernathy chats with local residents during a patrol near his base in Western Afghanistan

learning English is not just a class,
it’s a chance at liberation.”
Abernathy said protection is

always a concern, even though the

region is generally safe.

“I sleep with a loaded 9mm
automatic pistol at my headboard,
my loaded M4 carbine leaning
against a chair, a loaded AK-47
right next to it and even an old
.303 British Enﬁeld at my door.
Even inside our compound, I carry
the pistol with me everywhere ex-
cept the shower.”

Abernathy will serve in Af-
ghanistan for one year, at which
point his unit will be replaced by
others committed to the same task.

“I am both proud and humbled
to be here in service to my coun-

try and to this country. I am con-
vinced I and my team are making
a difference and will leave Afr-‘
ghanistan a better place for our
efforts.”

Across the continent, William
Fox, ’05, is stationed at Camp
Hovey in South Korea. Fox is a
platoon leader, in charge of train-
ing 27 American enlisted men and
stiﬂing North Korean aggression.
Fox said he is very conﬁdent in
his position, and he wishes to de-
ploy to Iraq in the near future.

“Ask me again when I’m step-
ping off the plane in the desert,
when the possibility of my own
death might start to seem real to
me,” he said. “I can’t think of any-
thing more important I will do in

my life [now] than lead young sol-
diers into combat and bring them
‘*'baCk'aiiva““""~-* ’

Fox said he sig"rie”d'”'u'p"'f6'r" ‘I

ROTC in 2001 because of the
challenge and the opportunity to
serve in the military before settling
down with a family.

“Due to the war on terror, I now
have a great opportunity to un-
dergo the greatest challenge I can

conceive of: leading men in com- ’

bat,” he said.

Back in the United States at
Fort Jackson, South Carolina,
Quincy Springs, ‘O3, is a com-
mander for a basic training unit,
transforming 188 civilians into
soldiers.

training and plan the training that
is most identical to what they will
see in Iraq or Afghanistan,” he

"said. “We have a basic outline of

what each soldier needs to know
before they go to the next stage.”

Springs said he began ROTC
training as a sophomore after be-
ing inspired by a Thomas Nagle
book about life and death in a Phi-
losophy course taught by Profes-
sor Sessions. Springs ended his
college career in 2003 as a distin-
guished military graduate and a
Philosophy major.

“One of the major contributing
factors to my career in the mili-
tary was my degree in Philoso-
phy,” he said. “The liberal arts
education allows me to see things
from multiple sides in the mili-
tary.”

Prior to his assignment in

tioned in Korea where his unit

Bringing balance to the lectern

Prominent conservative thinker and policy maker comes to campus for Lee Chapel address

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS EDITOR

The Contact committee has in-
vited a man born in India to tell
the campus about America.

Dinesh D’Souza, who received
widespread national attention in
1991 when he published Illiberal
Education, is known for his at-
tacks against political correctness
on college campuses.

“Contact wants to promote a
balanced debate on campus,”
committee member Rachel
Seidenschnur said.

“A lot of the time there’s a per-
ception that the administration
only brings in liberal speakers,”
she said. “We thought D’Souza
was one of the best people to add
a different viewpoint.”

D’Souza plans to discuss top-
ics he addressed in his most recent
book, “What’s so Great About
America.”

Born and raised in India, his
background gives him a unique
perspective on American politics.
He came to the United States as

an exchange student at age 17 and
after high school graduation en-
rolled at Dartmouth College. He
feels that his life in India helped
him see issues differently than
most Americans.

“The immigrant brings to
America a comparative perspec-
tive. How does US compare to
other existing cultures? What hap-
pens in US is you hear lots of cri-
tiques but they’re utopian com-
parisons.”

D’Souza said that his ideologi-
cal beliefs really began to develop
while he was at school.

“I think I reﬂect the social con-
servatism that stretches from
China to India to the Middle East,
but I just wasn’t really aware of it
until my political views started
developing at Dartmouth.”

D’Souza said that critics of
America point to politics that are
“based on self—interest.” But he
added that people outside the US
do not attack this idea.

“An immigrant has maybe a
more realistic perspective, be-
cause they’ve gotten to see an-

other system first hand.”
D’Souza also speaks out
against affirmative action.

“I’m in favor of diversity,” he
said, “but the question to ask is
what kind of diversity we are look-
ing for.”

“I ’m in favor of di-
versity, but the ques-
tion to ask is what
kind of diversity we
are looking for. ”

DINESH D’SOUZA
 

He questioned whether the tra-
ditional views of diversity are in
line with a liberal education.

“Should we focus on gender di-
versity and racial diversity, or
things like diversity of thought and
belief?” he said.

Professor Mark Rush, Chair-
man of W&L’s politics depart-
ment, said that the school still con-
tinues to deal with diversity of
opinion.

Rush pointed to the rural loca-
tion of the university as a factor
in its struggle for diversity.

He added that over the past de-
cades the university has become
more geographically diverse.

At age 44, D’Souza is consid-
ered one of the most inﬂuential
policy makers in the US and is a
fellow at Stanford.

D’Souza plans to cover several
other topics in his speech, includ-
ing a discussion of the war in Iraq.

Though his articles regularly
appear in major publications like
The New York Times and the Wall
Street Journal, D’Souza has few
friendly things to say about the
mainstream media.

“As far as I can tell, all the ma-
jor city newspapers — Washington
Post, Boston Globe, New York
Times, Chicago Tribune, San
Francisco Examiner) tilt sharply
to the left. They manifestly do this
on editorial pages, which I don’t
mind, but they also do it on their
news pages.”

D’Souza argues that conserva-

tive media outlets have sprung
up in an attempt to ﬁnd a way
to get the conservative message
out over the public airwaves.

“Conservative bloggers, talk
radio, Fox News Channel, and
the Washington Times,”
‘D’Souza said, “represent a frus-
trated effort to get around main
stream media.”

D’Souza plans to discuss
several of the issues raised in his
books, including “The End of
Racism,” and “Letters to a
Young Conservative.”

Seidenshnur said D’Souza
may also touch on problems he
feels America faces in the world
today.

“America has simulta-
neously become the most loved
and most hated society in the
world. We need to vindicate
idea of liberty by showing that
America can be materially and
morally strong.”

D’Souza will speak in Lee
Chapel on Mar. 2.

BEIND
BARS

Here’s the latest update on who

  

ran afoul of the law during the
last few weeks. News editor
Jacob Geiger took a peek at
this weeks police reports to see

what you ’ve been up to.

 

Lawless law students
Though W&L’s undergradu-
ates took last week off, the
law students carried on the
party unabated. Bassel
Khalaf picked up a DIP on
Sat., Feb. 18. Khalaf was ar-
rested at 3:30 a.m., becom-
ing one of only a few law
students to run into serious
legal trouble this year. As
always, Behind Bars hopes
a few of his classmates
will help defend him in
court.

Wrong seat at the

defense table

Patricia Fenton, another
first-year law student, also
ran afoul of the police earlier
this month. She was cited
for being drunk in public
around 2:00 a.m. on Fri.,
Feb. 3. As if she didn’t have
problems enough already,
Fenton was then charged
with resisting arrest. Per-
haps in the future, when she
passes the bar exam, she will
advise her clients to go qui-
etly down to the station and
urge them not to cause a
fuss.

No break

for the police

With fewer people to watch
for during Feb. Break, the
police were able to track
down Cyrus Carawan. The
20-year-old was charged
with being drunk in public as
well as underage possession
of alcohol. In an effort to
cut down on arrest numbers,

maybe W&L can work out a
way to send the police on a
paid vacation of their own
(somewhere far from stu-
dents, of course). Then Lex-
ington could finally drink in
peace.

Should have left town
Will Moore, a W&L fresh-
man and Lexington resident,
was arrested on Fri., Feb. 17
and charged with underage
possession of alcohol and a
DIP. Moore was arrested
around 11:35 p.m., and he
was also charged with ob-
structing justice. Apparently
the snow and lack of light
has increased the combative-
ness of both students and po-
lice officers, as the last few
weeks have seen a dramatic
up tick in charges of resist-
ing arrest or obstructing jus-
tice.

With age comes
wisdom, right?

Though earlier editions of
Behind Bars were stocked
with plenty of freshman ar-
rests, it’s been a tough few
weeks for older students.
Samuel Nickles, a senior,
was arrested on Sun., Feb. 4
at 2:17 p.m. and hit with a
DIP. Five people — four of
them W&L students — have
received DIPs in the last
month. February may be
dark and depressing, but the
ever—vigilant officers of Lex-
ington are waiting for you to
meander on by in the wee
hours of a weekend morning.

Mind your manners
Clifton»Forge resident Jason
Staggs had a rough go of
things last Saturday, being
cited for a DUI as well as re-
fusal to comply with an
officer’s instructions. Staggs
was arrested at 3:05 a.m. on
Feb. 18. In all honesty, a
DUI stop is really not the
time to practice your favorite
methods of civil disobedi-
ence. Maybe it would have
just been better to climb into
the squad car.

You can drink at 21...
Christopher Woods, age 21,
of Buena Vista was arrested
on Fri., Feb. 3 around 10:30
p.m. Not only was he
charged with reckless driv-
ing, he faces a DUI charge.
To review: you were drink-
ing, you were driving, you
can’t do that.

But not drive at 21
Like Woods, another 21-
year-old faces a DUI charge
stemming from the first
weekend of February. Rob-
ert Stockwell was arrested
that Sunday morning, Feb. 5,
around 3:40 a.m. As count-
less students and locals
could have told Stockwell,
the police patrol all night.
You cannot just hope to
outlast them and then try to
drive. Though Police Chief
Bruce Beard reports that
DUI arrest rates are drop-
ping, it appears the latest

generation of legal drinkers
still hasn’t quite caught on
yet.

For form's sake

David Mann received a
ticket for driving the wrong
way on a one way street.
Like most other ‘wrong
wayers,’ Mann’s ticket came
late at night — 12:15 a.m. in

his case.Though the ticket it-

self is not very serious, Be-
hind Bars is continually sur-
prised at how many people

continue to have trouble with

the concept. There is good

news on the horizon, though;

since Mann’s ticket on Sun.
Feb. 5, not one person in
Lexington has received a
ticket for this offense.
Maybe there is hope for ev-
eryone after all.

All bark, all bite

Bruce Cooper was ticketed
on Feb. 21 for keeping a
dangerous dog. The charge
apparently stems from his
pet pit bull, since when the

ticket was issued at 9 a.m. he
was also charged with allow-

ing a pit bull to run at large.
Watch dogs are all well and
good, but usually they

should confine themselves to

a bit of growling and bark-
ing. Cooper’s dogs aren’t

accused of attacking anyone,

but Lexington Police de-
cided that maybe Cooper’s
friendly ole’ guard dog
should not be a breed that is
capable of mauling most
adults.

 Keeping Watch Variety of alumni

The Spectator political review returns to campus

By Sarah Kientz
R E P 0 RT E R

The conservative magazine
The Spectator reappears on cam-
pus this week.

According to the W&L Stu-
dent Affairs website, The Spec-
tator is “a non—partisan publica-
tion dedicated to promoting the
free exchange of ideas in an en-
vironment where meaningful de-
bate and ideological diversity
are often lacking.”

Senior co-editor-in-chief
Alex Weintz said the magazine
will focus on three central val-
ues: free speech, student au-
tonomy and honor.

“Free speech on college cam-
puses around the country has
been jeopardized by political
correctness,” Weintz said. “We
are not trying to offend anyone
but we’re not going to not say
something just because it
might.”

Weintz said the first issue will
include articles on the presiden-
tial search, pro-life movements
on campus and an appeal for ad-
ministration to take a more
“hands—off” approach to Con-
tact, as well as two articles on
national issues.

The issue will tentatively ap-
pear on newsstands Mar. 1, and
the staff hopes to publish two
more issues by the end of the
school year.

Editor-at—Large Rachael
Seidenschnur said the magazine
will “concentrate first and fore-
most on campus issues.”

“We want to address intellec-
tual issues occurring on campus
and provide serious arguments
for or against those topics,”
Seidenschnur said.

Seidenschnur has been work-

ing. with alumnus Kenneth
Cribb, Class of I970, to bring
The Spectator back to campus.
Seidenschnur said that although
some students may not agree
with what the magazine says,
there will be a place for it at
W&L.

“[Cribb] said he didn’t sup-
port everything the magazine
said [during his college years],
but he supported the student au-
tonomy and that there was a
publication of its kind,” she
said. .

Seidenschnur said this was
the reason she wanted to bring

“We are not trying to
offend anyone but
we’re not going to not
say something just be-

cause it might.”

A L E X W E I N T Z
Co—Editor of The Spectator
 

The Spectator back to campus.

Weintz said he feels The
Spectator needs to reappear at
W&L because there is a need for
a more “serious” publication.

“I have nothing against pub-
lications such as The Ring-tum
Phi, The Trident and inGeneral,
but a large portion of those pub-
lications focus on drinking and
parties and issues like that,”
Weintz said. “There’s a gaping
void for serious student publica-
tions that addresses local and
national issues.”

Weintz said the magazine will
address news issues while tak-
ing a “traditionalist” outlook. He
stressed that the magazine is not

affiliated with College Republi-
cans, but will have a conserva-
tive or libertarian spin.

The magazine’s mission state-
ment on the Student Affairs
website states, “We take it as our
mission to expose the inadequa-
cies of the non—traditionalist
ideas that do not understand and
fail to work with our student
body.”

Weintz also added that he
hopes students who do not share
conservative views will take in-
terest in The Spectator.

“I would think they’d be
happy,” Weintz said of liberal
students. “I enjoy reading things
from all sorts of people with dif-
ferent opinions and I’d hope
they’d appreciate it.”

David Mitchell, president of
Young Democrats, said he thinks
the magazine will “contribute the
conservative stereotype of W&L
students.” He does not think The
Spectator will have a large audi-
ence from the W&L liberal com-
munity.

“Democrats will probably pay
The Spectator as little attention
and respect as we currently give
to media such as FOX News,”
Mitchell said. “I will not person-
ally be an avid reader of the
magazine, but I respect the rights
of individuals with conservative
political views to exercise their
first amendment rights.”

Overall, Weintz said he hopes
students, no matter their politi-
cal affiliation, will read the
magazine.

“I hope people will read it,
take interest in it and talk about
it,” Weintz said. “It will be a posi-
tive impact for people to talk
about it even if they don’t agree
with it.”

took charge of keeping the
peace.

A few months after his de-
ployment, he was ordered to
transport 3,000 American sol»
diers and thousands of supplies
to Iraq in a brief amount of
time.

Springs has not been de-
ployed to Iraq, but he says he
will be happy to serve his coun-
try if the time comes.

“There’s nothing like
America,” he said. “It is, in my
opinion, thegreatest country
on the face of the planet. In the
military, you do your duty. If
I’m called up to do it, I will do
it. It just so happens that my
number hasn’t been called up.”

Davis White, ’03, currently
works for the Afghanistan Re-
construction Group, stationed
in Kabul as the Special Assis-
tant to the Ambassador. White
discovered the opportunity af-
ter his work on the Bush-
Cheney campaign and his ef-
forts serving on the presiden-
tial inaugural committee.

“W&L teaches you to be in-
dependent from my experi-
ence,” he said. “That’s what led
me to look for jobs out of the
box.”

Though much of Davis’
work involves an office, he
said there have been times of
danger.

“I was on a day-trip with the
US. ambassador, and there
was a suicide bombing about a
quarter mile from us which
killed 12 and injured 50-plus,”
he said.

Currently stationed in Iraq,

Brian Tinklepaugh, ’03, has
experienced constant action.
Last Spring, Tall Afar, a region
in Iraq, was overtaken by an
Iraqi branch of Al Qaeda. This
region was transformed into a
terrorist training ground for re-
ligious extremists and other
rebels. Tinklepaugh’s mission
was to halt its existence and
restore peace to the region.

“The city was totally out of
control, with insurgents domi-
nating the city physically and
psychologically,” he said.

Tinklepaugh’s unit was un-
der constant attack for a period
of time. He said every vehicle
in his platoon had sustained
damage from RPG fire or
other artillery. During a mu-
tine patrol, he and his unit
were fired upon by an insur-
gent vehicle.

“The explosion was like

nothing I had ever seen,” he ’

said. “It shook my 34-ton ve-
hicle and threw us around in-
side the turret. When I looked
back, all I saw was a fireball
and billowing black smoke.’’ a

Tinklepaugh said his expe-
rience at W&L and training at
Virginia. Military Instutute
helped him achieve many of
his missions. .

According to Scholarship
and Enrollment Officer at
VMI Major John Wranek, un-
til the early 1990s, W&L of-
fered its own ROTC program
to students. In, 1996, W&L and
VMI established a partnership
that now allows students to
enroll in ROTC classes on the
VMI campus.

“Right now, out of those

or three per year,” he said;

“We like to see three per year,

and I think we can get there.”
Presently, there are five

"freshmen, two sophomores,

two juniors and one senior
involved in the joint pro-
gram. V

Sophomore Rob Modlin
is in his second year with the
program. Though one is not
committed to military service
when enrolled in this pro-
gram, Modlin plans to serve
for a number of years.
Modlin said that W&L is pre-
paring him in critical ways
for his time in the military.

“Washington and Lee be-
lieves that students should be

nity,” he said. “The military
is completely centered on the

THE RING-TUM PHI - 3

Language of home

Making the move from Ghana to Virginia brought numerous lifestyle changes and cultural adjustments

After traveling from Africa, Ghanaian

students at Washington and Lee had to

master another language and adjust to new

customs and social traditions.

By Steph Wiechmann
5 TA F F W R IT E R

Eﬁa. For sophomore Marian
Botchway and freshman Grace
Andrews, that translates “home.”
And home is an ocean away.

Both Botchway and Andrews
were born in Ghana, West Africa,
a small country about the size of
Oregon.

Botchway still makes her
home there, in a city called Tema,
about 30 minutes away from the
capital city of Accra.

Andrews and her family
moved to the U.S. 13 years ago,
but she carries dual citizenship
and considers Ghana just as
much her home as her residence
in Tennessee.

“At home [in Tennessee],”
she said, “we ate the food, spoke
the language and wore the

clothes. It’s so much a part of
who I am.”

Botchway and Andrews speak
Twi, which is pronounced like
“tree,” one of the major native
languages of
Ghana.

There are
many different
dialects of the
language.

B otc hw ay
speaks the
dialect of her
father’s tribe,
A k u a p i m .
A n d r e w s ’
dialect comes
from her mother’s tribe, Achim.
Both girls are able to understand
each other.

But, since they are the only
two current Ghanaian students at
Washington and Lee, they don’t
get to speak Twi very much.

“I miss speaking Ga and Twi
with my friends,” said Botchway,
who also speaks another major
native language of Ghana. “I talk
to Grace sometimes,” she added,
but since both are usually in
company of others, they usually
speak English.

Twi is different from romance
languages, like Spanish and
French, because it does not
differentiate between feminine
and masculine words.

“It’s not he or she, it’s they,”
said Andrews.

The language was originally
written in symbols. Over time,
it was “Romanized” and written
with letters, though sometimes
letters different from the Roman
alphabet.

The Twi alphabet includes
letters that look like a backwards

“a,” “c” and “h.”

The Ghanaian culture,
however, is not just about the
language.

“I miss the closeness,” said
Botchway, who has not been
back to Ghana since she left the
country to begin college in 2004.

“Lots of people who are close
to you in Ghana live within an
hour of each other.”

Botchway recently went to
visit a Ghanaian friend who goes
to college in Boston and found
the ten-hour drive unsettling.

Both women, like many other
international students, went
through their share of culture
shock when they entered the
United States.

Botchway, who had attended
an international boarding school
at home, was prepared for what
awaited her and was old enough
to successfully deal with the
differences.

“The food wasn’t spicy
enough,” Botchway said. Then,
she had to get used to the way
people behave in America.

“In Ghana, you don’t give
something to someone with your

left hand. It’s disrespectful.”

In America, she had to learn
that that gesture did not mean
anything bad.

Andrews moved to the U.S.
when she was four years—old and
immediately attended an
international school.

She had begun school in
Ghana at two-years, so she had
a basic understanding of English.
But, she refused to speak it — she
spoke Twi.

“My brother attended school
across the street,” she said. “My
teacher had to call his school and
have him come over at snack
time so he could translate what I
wanted to eat.”

Being in an international
school was beneﬁcial, she said,

“Ghana is where
my family is,
and that’s my home.”

because other students had the
same problems. “We were all
going through culture shock
together.”

There were things that the
Andrews family and Botchway
had to learn through time.

In Ghana, almost everything
is eaten with your hands, and
Ghanians have to learn what
foods are typically eaten with
utensils in the U.S.

But, as Andrews said, not
everything can be learned.

“Sarcasm is lost on my
mother,” she said. “Sarcasm is
a very American thing.”

Botchway and Andrews both
hope to someday return to
Ghana.

“There’s a resurgence of my
generation,” said Andrews.
“Many have a desire to go back.”

Andrews, a politics and
Spanish major with a
concentration in Women’s
Studies, wants to work for
women and children’s rights.

Botchway, a biology major,
wants to stay in the U.S. for
graduate studies, but does intend
to go back to Ghana.

She said, “Ghana is where my
family is and that’s my home.”

W&L considers partnering with the Posse Foundation in order to acquire much—needed diversity

By EJ. Boyer
STAFF WRITER

On a campus known for its
lack of diversity, there may be a
new Posse next year to teach us
a thing or two.

The Posse Foundation, which
develops, trains, and enables
underprivileged youth leaders to
attend top colleges and univer-
sities, is in talks with Washing-
ton and Lee to bring its program
to the school. '

If adopted, a “multicultural
Posse” of ten students whom the
traditional admissions procedure
may have missed, would attend
W&L on full scholarships. Be-
sides obtaining a top—rate educa-
tion, the Posse would “help pro-
mote cross-cultural communica-
tion on campus.”

The Posse program recruits
6,000 students graduating from
public high schools in New York
City, Washington D.C., Boston,
Chicago and Los Angeles, and
after a three—step admissions pro-
cess, chooses around 300 Posse
Scholars each year.

To be chosen as a Posse
Scholar, students must perform
well on the Posse-innovated Dy-
namic Assessment Process
(DAP), an alternative way to
judge a student’s capabilities and
potential beyond the traditional
SAT and GPA approach. Posse
identiﬁes its three main criteria
in selection as a student’s “lead-
ership talent, ability to work in a
team with people from diverse
backgrounds and desire to suc-
ceed.”

Once chosen, Posse scholars
select their top three universities
and colleges of the 24 currently
participating, which include
Middlebury, Vanderbilt and
Pomona. Then, the admissions

 

office at the universities and the
Posse staff pick the ten kids best
fit for each school. These ten
kids are now a “posse,” and go
through a training program to-
gether that requires them to meet
weekly for two hours over an
eight-month period. The training
targets team building and group
support, cross-cultural commu-
nication, leadership, and aca-
demic excellence.

The leadership ability found
in their students is one of Posse’s
prized accomplishments. About
70 percent of Posse students be-
come leaders or founders of cam-
pus groups. “They don’t star as
students,” President Harlan
Beckley said, “they star as lead-
ers and do well as students.”

One concern skeptics have is
the academic record of the Posse
students. They would bring
down the average SAT score of
any university they attend.

Beckley estimates that the
SAT_scores of an entering class
including Posse students would
drop the average from 1380 to
1372. The grades of Posse stu-
dents in their freshman year are
typically lower than the grades
of their school’s average student.

However, by graduation,
Posse grades are usually equal or
even a little better than those of
the average student. Beckley said
he would like to see clear-cut
data on Posse students’ GPAs

before any decision is made, but
said there is every reason to be-
lieve they do just as well as the
average student by the time they
graduate. /

‘ Professor Gwyn Campbell of
the Language Department dis-
missed the objection about the
lowered GPA, saying, “We don’t
need to see GPAs. I trust Beckley,
and he trusts Posse.”

Another concern about the
Posse program is how the stu-
dents factor into the campus
population and how the program
would be funded. Posse students
can either be “add-ons” to the
university enrollment, meaning
the student body size would ex-
pand; or, Posse students can re-
place members of the student
body, and the size would not
change. In terms of financing the
Posse students, President
Beckley said the university
would need a “huge infusion” of
need—based money or to convert
some of the existing merit—based
money, or both.

Another student raised the
concern that the Posse students
might find it difficult to acclimate
to W&L. President Beckley
stressed that even though 90 per-
cent of Posse students are people
of color, “they themselves are di-
verse.” They are so different
from one another, Beckley said,
that he foresees no problem with
them branching out from one an-

“I was really excited because I think

anything that brings diversity to W&L is

important and will help us.”

other and mixing well with the
student body.

Beckley heard about Posse at
an academic conference he at-
tended in New York City, at
which Posse’s founder, Deborah
Bial, spoke about the program.
The Posse Foundation then ap-
proached W&L about a possible
partnership.He said that Posse
students who would attend W&L
are students who would flourish
here, but don’t have opportuni-
ties or are overlooked in the ad-
missions process. He also said
that diversiﬁcation would actu-
ally help the university’s
rankings.

The possibility of a Posse at
W&L is nonetheless controver-
sial. Sophomore Jenny N iemann
heard about the-Posse program
when Bial came to campus to
speak. “I was really excited be-
cause I think anything that brings
diversity to W&L is important
and will help us,” she said.

However, a sophomore man
who wishes to remain anony-
mous said he hopes that W&L
does not partner with the Posse
Foundation. He said he does not
think that a forced diversiﬁcation
process is the answer, much less
one that allows some students to
be accepted regardless of SAT
scores, grades and other tradi-
tional academic qualifiers that
the rest of the student body needs
for admission regardless of need
or race.

One professor at the informa-
tion session pointed out that next
year is the fortieth anniversary of
integration at W&L. Introducing
the Posse program seems like the
ultimate way to commemorate
that anniversary, but Beckley
said he does not know when a de-
cision will be made.

Long year over in first round

g Ups and downs of girls basketball season end with tough loss in ODAC tournament

By Andy McEnroe
G U EST WRITER

“It was a long bus ride back,”
described Sophomore point
guard Emily Wolff, after their
disappointing 71-46 loss to
Bridgewater College on Jan. 18.

At the time, Washington and
Lee stood with a record of 4-11
overall and a conference record
of 3-9. The Generals had lost
ﬁve in a row, all to ODAC foes.

The team now also had to
face the facts that Sophomore
Forward Hayley James was lost
for the season with a knee injury.

It appeared that the Generals
were looking at the possibility
of not being in the 2006 ODAC
tournament.

But if there was one word to
describe the 2005-2006 Wash-
ington and Lee Generals
women’s basketball team it
would be “resilient.”

After the Bridgewater loss,
the Generals went on to win six
of their ﬁnal nine regular sea-
son games with key conference
wins over Emory and Henry,
Roanoke and Lynchburg, play-
ing their way into the ODAC
tournament as the 8"‘ seed.

During this stretch W&L was

paced by Senior guard Louisa
Feve. Feve, who was only aver-
aging 9.1 points per game before
this ﬁnal stretch of the regular
season, carried the Generals on
her back, scoring 16 points with
six assists and 10 rebounds in the
Generals win over E&H, on Jan.
24, and 20 points and six assists
in a huge road victory over
Roanoke on Jan. 28.

“We saw a side of Feve’s
game that we had not seen this
year starting with the Emory and
Henry victory. Feve had distrib-
uted the ball well throughout the
season but now she was begin-
ning to take it to the basket her-
self and score,” said WLUR
women’s basketball Analyst Will
Waller on Feve’s outstanding
play. Feve finished the regular
season in the top 20 for scoring
in the ODAC and in the top five
for assists.

Feve’s passing ability has
helped Sophomore Kristen
Krouchick and Junior Jessica
Hunsinger provide a formidable
dynarnic—duo offensive threat for
the Generals.

Krouchick averaged 14.5
points per game, shooting an
outstanding 49.1 percent from
the field and 36.1 percent from

beyond the three point are.
Krouchick also contributed on
the boards as she pulled down an
average of 5.3 rebounds per
game.

“When Kristin is on, she is
one of, if not the best, shooters
in the conference. There were
many times when our offense
was stalled and we relied on
Kristen to get us a big basket,”
said Wolff. Krouchick ﬁnished in
the top ten in ODAC in scoring
and shooting percentage.

Where Krouchick is the threat
from the outside, Hunsinger pro-
vides a strong post presence for
the Generals.

Hunsinger led the Generals in
scoring, averaging 15.1 points
per game. She was also ﬁnished
ﬁrst in the conference in blocks
and second in rebounding, aver-
aging 2.8 blocks per game and

10.1 rebounds per game.

Said Waller, “The Generals
were a different team when Jes-
sica was not on the ﬂoor. With-
out Jessica, the Generals were
undersized, but with Jessica on
the ﬂoor it gave the team an ad-
vantage on both the offensive
and defensive ends.

Waller called Hunsinger
“someone who could score down
low as well as create second
chance opportunities with her
offensive rebounding prowess.
On the defensive end, her shot-
blocking ability caused many
opposing players to alter their
shot when driving into the paint.”

The Generals also received
solid contributions throughout
the year from two ﬁrst year start-
ers, Wolff and Freshmen For-
ward Kara Nadeau.

“Emily has done a great job

“The Generals played inspired

basketball, giving the number one
seed...their biggest scare by far in

the tournament. ”

End of the fight

Wrestling team ﬁnishes 8th at Centennial Tourney despite strong season

By Mike Fahey
STAFF WRITER

Conference championships are
supposed to be when a team peaks
and has its best performance.

In the case of the Washington
and Lee Wrestling team, the Cen-
tennial Conference Champion-
ships were marred by the injury of
one of the team’s stars and the dis-
qualification of another key per-
former because he did not make
weight.

Earlier in the season, Jesse
Sataloff, one of team strongest
wrestlers, sustained a minor con-
cussion while wrestling an oppo-
nent. At the tri-match between
W&L, Ursinus and Muhlenberg,
Sataloff suffered a second concus-
sion within two weeks of his first
concussion. The injury not only
sent him home, but it also side-
lined him for the rest of the sea-
son.

Peter Lawrence did not make

weight in the 149 pound weight
class, leaving the Generals with-
out an entry in the weight division.

Down two of their best wres-
tlers, the Generals were faced with
an uphill battle as they began their
quest.

As freshman John Christopher
explained, “I think we may have
peaked at the wrong time.”

While the team did not place
as high as they would have had
they been wrestling at full
strength, two young stars were still
able to make their mark at the con-
ference championships.

Christopher placed third over-
all in the heavyweight division,
one of only two Generals to place
in the conference championships.
Christopher was humble about his
results in the championships, say-
ing, “This year was a learning year
for me along with several others
and hopefully we can put every-
thing together come next season.”

The only other General to place

at the conference championships
was Tom Hosford, who placed
fourth in the 125 weight class.

Sophomore Anthony Boniello,
who wrestled in the 165 weight
class said, “I feel like the wres-
tling team had a lot more poten-
tial than how we wrestled at the
Centennial Conference. We had
Jesse out due to an injury and Pe-
ter didn’t make weight. These two
kids could have easily put on a lot
more points for the team standing,
elevating our team standing.”

While this season may have
had a disappointing ending, the
young team is excited about sea-
sons to come, as it only has one
junior, Max Courtney.

Boniello explained, “We had
an excellent season, surpassing
many people’s
expectations...We’re all looking
forward to next year’s season with
high expectations due to our ex-
perience gained from this season.”

of stepping up into the role of
starting point guard. One of the
things that impresses me most
about her is how she always goes
hard.

“Kara has really made a great
transition into college basketball
and gives us a true post. She
knows how to use her body well
offensively and defensively, but
she can also step out and knock
down a three.” said sophomore
forward Hayley James.

Wolff averaged 7.1 points per
game, 4.9 rebounds per game
and 2.6 assists per game on the
year, while Nadeau averaged a
solid 6.6 points per game and 5.4
rebounds.

A big part of W&L’s success-
ful turnaround can be credited to
the bench play of sophomore
Amanda Kane, freshman
Bethany Ridenhour and senior
Taylor Gibson.

“Our bench was a key part of
our success the second half of the
season both in the game and in
practice.” said Wolff, “without
them I don’t think we would have
been able to pull off the kind of
streak we did to make the tour-
nament.”

W&L finished the regular
season with a record of 11-14
overall, and an ODAC record of
8-12.

Their conference record was
good enough for the Generals to
garner the eighth seed in the tour-

nament where they faced the‘

number one seed Randolph Ma-
con Yellow Jackets (2l—2 over-
all, 18—1 in the ODAC). The Yel-
low Jackets came into the tour-
nament ranked ninth in the USA
Today/ESPN/WBCA national
poll.

The Generals played inspired
basketball, giving the number
one seed Yellow Jackets their
toughest game and biggest scare
by far in the tournament.

The Generals were led by
sophomore forward Kristen
Krouchick , who scored a team-
high 21 points, dished out a ca-
reer—high seven assists and
grabbed ﬁve rebounds.

Hunsinger finished with 19
points, nine rebounds and three
blocks.

Feve notched 16 points, nine
rebounds, a game-high eight as-
sists and a game-best ﬁve steals.

Despite the outcome, the
Generals Women’s Basketball
program is strong, graduating
only three seniors.

Look for the Generals to build
on their late season success and
continue to develop into a for-
midable ODAC contender for
years to come.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Decades of winning

Women ’s swimming wins thirteenth straight ODACS

By Elliott Walker
STAFF WRITER

Thirteen may be an unlucky
number for some, but for the
women’s swim team, it meant just
the opposite. The team claimed
their thirteenth consecutive
ODAC championship last week-
end, beating 11 other teams in
their quest to be number one.

Like the men’s team, the
women had an overwhelming vic-
tory, beating their opponents by
260.5 points. To keep the team
motivated to swim their best, head
coach Kiki Jacobs said she gave
them point goals for each meet.

Although the team had some
struggles, said Jacobs, the team
was able to come together in the
end to win the meet. Some of their
top swimmers were present at the
meet, but were unable to score
points for the team. These girls
were swimming exhibition, mean-
ing that they can still swim for
time, but do not count in the team
score. Even though these girls
were not scoring, the team still
managed to emerge victorious.

“It was a fun championship”
said head coach Kiki Jacobs, who
was named ODAC coach of the
year for the tenth time at the meet.
Freshman Jule Miata said Jacobs

“brings such a positive atmo-
sphere to the team” and has been
one of the most amazing coaches
she’s ever had.

Jacobs also credits the strong
parental support that the girls re-
ceive throughout the season.
Nineteen sets of parents came to
supportthe 21 girls swimming at
the ODAC championships this
year. The parents bring presents
for all of the girls, as well as
Gatorade and other things to keep
everyone going, said Danielle
Cardone, a sophomore on the
team.

“It’s our own little cheering
section,” she said. “It’s great to
have them.”

The team finished their season
with a perfect 6-0 ODAC record
and 10-5 overall. Miata says their
success this season was partly due
to the encouraging attitudes
among teammates.

Next year, Jacobs said she’d
like the team to have more than
10 dual meet wins, set new school
recordsyand of course, win that
fourteenth ODAC championship.
Recruiting efforts promise to bring
in talented new swimmers for next
year, said Miata.

“I only see the team getting
better,” she said.

The men’s swimming
team was only predicted to
win the Bluegrass Mountain
Conference Championship
by 30-40 points, but the
closest team lagged behind
by a whopping 315 points
last weekend. The Gener-
als’ impressive win was their
third straight championship
title.

“We knew that there
would be good competition
at the meet and that we
would have to rise to the

McGlaston, a sophomore on
the team. ~

tioned that Burr Datz has worked
with the team for thepast two
years to improve communication
and goal-setting on the team.

Shinofield went on to say that
this has been his favorite season
in the past ten years. “Every mem-
ber of the team has contributed to
our success this year, and I
couldn’t be happier with the ef-
fort they gave,” he said.

The Washington and Lee base-

junior designated hitter Richard
Garland.

Brownlow took the hill for the
Generals in the opener and pitched
well, giving up only two unearned
runs on four hits in four innings
to capture the victory. Sophomore
Steve Marcott then came in and
pitched four scoreless innings,
striking out five batters.

After a tough loss to Emory, the
Generals were back in the swing
of things as they dominated
Oglethorpe. Senior second
baseman Scott Gosselink was 4-6
with a homerun, two doubles and
five RBIs to pace the Generals,
and junior Jordan Wesley also
homered. Junior righthander
Clayton Edwards got the win af-
ter giving up three runs in six in-
nings of work. Freshman
righthander Andrew Henderson
came in to pitch three scoreless
inning to pick up the save.

In a 15-4 victory over Virginia

Intermont, James Madden again
led the way for the Generals, go-
ing 3-4 with a triple, a homerun,
three runs and four RBIs. The
Generals jumped out to a 2-0 lead

after the first inning on a pair of
RBI singles by Wesley and Mad-

den. Once they had the lead, they
never gave it up. Senior first
baseman Taylor McConnell went
3-5 with two doubles and two
runs, while junior leftfielder
David Miller was 2-4 with two
stolen bases, two runs and three
RBIs.

Sophomore lefthander John
Parker pitched four and one-thirds
innings, allowing two runs on five
hits with three strikeouts. Sopho-
more righthander Tim Livingston
picked up the win, throwing one
and one-thirds innings of scoreless
ball.

Madden has had an incredible
start to the season, with three
home runs in the team’s first six

games. Parker said, “At the begin-
ning of the season the third out-
field spot was up for grabs, and I
think James has secured it with his
excellent all- around perfor-
mance.”

Parker also was very compli-
mentary to the man behind the
plate, Wesley. Parker said, “Jor-
dan is the defensive rock of this
team, and has been doing a fan-
tastic job at game calling and han-
dling the pitching staff, which to
this point has underachieved in
terms of preseason expectations.”

Wesley said, “Overall, we have
played well enough to get off to a
good start, though I don’t think
anyone on the team will deny that
we are playing to less than our po-
tential.”

The season has only just begun
as the Generals have yet to begin
conference play. As Wesley said,
“the most important part of the
year [is] conference play.”

ODIIIIIIIIS

 

 

editorial

Posse for
everyone

With the very. best of
intentions, administration at this
school is trying to attract diversity
with the Posse Foundation.

The idea behind Posse is solid:

' students are chosen based on

some other set of criteria, in order
to seek out talent which would
have otherwise gone unnoticed.

Seems ﬂawless, right?

Well, maybe.

The Posse program seems like
a great idea in the sense that these
students, who would not
otherwise have been glanced at,
get the chance to move out of that
station.

Without the program, our
school is a poorly-tossed salad
bowl of WASPS with pretty
uniform upper middle class
breeding.

Consistently, W&L turns out
successful kids--people who go on
to do something big with their
lives.

Do students outside of this
network deserve the same
opportunity?

Certainly.

If they weren’t offered the
opportunity by W&L, would they
be forever denied success?

Unlikely.

But if they attend W&L as a
part of this generous program--a
veritable form of bussing on a
much larger scale--then the
program and the school can take
credit for saving a life.

If you think about it, one of the
most commonly—asked questions
in any given class is always, “Is
this going to be on the test?”

The people chosen under
“normal” criteria at Washington
and Lee do not start class
discussions. Rare is the class
where stimulating intellectual
discussion can be held.

And yet many students manage
to get above a 3.0.

That is because W&L students
know how to get the A. We know
how to take a test, and how to
study, and how to wheedle extra
credit from our professors.

But we cannot, for some
reason, advance beyond success
on paper.

The Posse Scholars would
come from the type of families
and schools that don’t understand
or care about grades in the same
way that many W&L students do.

In the world of a non-W&L
student, getting a C is okay if you
learn something and do your best.

In the world of the Posse
Scholar, getting somewhere in life
means going the extra mile, not
running the fastest around the
track.

Further, how comfortable
would a Posse scholar be in the
country club that is our school?
No amount of financial aid can
compensate for a life spent in the
much-larger bracket of American
society--the lower-middle class.

Without some kind of parental‘

funding, it would be difficult to
participate in the ever-prevalent
Greek system which rules all.
Road trips and vacations are out
of the question. Nice new clothes
for every event would be a burden.

Would the misery of societal
rejection encourage a healthy
learning environment?

The fact is that this school was

not designed for a low-income
student.

Should the Posse scholars be
thankful? Should the program
expect absolute servitude in
thanks for the opportunity?

That would be truly unfair.

But let’s say, for example, that
this program were implemented,
that we conned ten kids into going
here so that we can learn from
them and they can make us look
better.

The Posse students, who
would be, effectively, stuck
together in a “posse,” would likely
not mingle into the crowds on the
hill or at the frat parties.

They would stick together for
the simple reason that they are
alike in their common bond--a
somewhat unique one at W&L.

Worse yet-—if the Posse
scholars have these special
characteristics that are so valuable
to the institution, why aren’t they
the admissions criteria for
everyone?

The program is designed to
bring diversity to the school and
opportunity for the scholar.

But it raises questions about
the caliber of student W&L
admits.

Apparently, the school admits
any schmuck with a good GPA
and high SAT score.

The administration should
hold every incoming student to
the same standards as the Posse
scholar. We need leaders rather
than another kid who gets good
grades.

We need students to care about
their subject matter, and not their
resume and honor roll status.

But let’s start with baby steps.

The Posse Foundation, with its
program, has a goal that is
laudable and important--as long
as it avoids setting quotas on race
or financial background.

The Posse student, who has
talents outside of classroom work
is more useful at this institution
filled with students who do their
best not to stand out. It is both
unrealistic and unfair to expect an
18-year-old to set an example, but
the leadership tendencies of the
Posse scholars may prove useful.

Concerns that the Posse
scholars, with their not-so-
impressive GPAs, would hurt the
school’s average and make us
look bad are not unfounded,
either.

Most Posse students are not
necessarily “good” at school.
They didn’t get A’s in high school-
-and they won’t get A’s here.

But those concerns are purely
about appearance rather than
content--not unlike the behavior
of most W&L students in class.

In truth, we need Posse
scholars at this university.

We need students who
remember how to learn they way
we did when we were small
children.

We need students who
question the professor over his
material, and not his tests. We
need people who are not afraid to
speak in class.

We need to become Posse
scl1olars—-all of us.

The above represents the
majority opinion of the editorial
staff of the Ring-tum Phi.

 

“If they attend W&L as a part of this

generous program--a veritable form of

bussing on a much-larger scale--then the

program can take credit for saving a life. ”

guess I should say, I was from
New Orleans. I was from a city
famous for its lively spirit, great
food, superb music and laid back
way of life. I was from a big city
with a small town mentality and a
personality not found anywhere
else in this country.

That city is gone.

Now I say that I am from the
new New Orleans. That’s what
they’re calling it down there now,
the new New Orleans. I am from
a city whose heart has been
broken. You can see it in the face
of every person you meet. We
have all had our hearts broken and,
as Chris Rose of the Times
Picayune so plainly put it, “when
you look into our eyes, you will
see the saddest story ever told.”
Fortunately, the city that we all
were from hasn’t been forgotten.
Being from the old New Orleans
meant possessing not only a first
class sense of humor, but an
inordinate amount of patience and
an ever-hopeful smile; a sort of
grin-and-nod, go with the flow
attitude that made life a little less
stressful. And if you look very
hard, past the sad story that our
eyes will tell you, you will find
that easy optimism lurking
beneath the surface, silently
assuring us that, surely, things will
get better.

For right now though, things

 

are not getting better. Driving into
the city from the east over Winter
Break, past some of the hardest hit
areas, it looks the same as it did
when I drove in for Christmas and
much the same as it must have
looked in the weeks immediately
following the storm.

Trash, fallen trees and other
debris and demolished homes and
businesses surround the
interstate. Car dealerships and
grocery stores are flattened;
Lowe’s, Wal-mart and other big
chain stores are boarded up and
abandoned.

Coming back home makes my
heart break all over again.

If you can make it past the
wasteland scene and into the city,
you find what my mother, only

partly in jest, calls “Soviet.

:9

Russia. Here is the twenty
‘percent of the city that ‘didn’t find
itself under ten or more feet of
water and where most of those
brave enough to return have
settled.

Everywhere you go, from the
gas stations to the grocery stores
to the restaurants, there are lines
that stretch out the door and
sometimes down the block. There

are piles of trash and lumber on
the street comers and their pickup
is, at best, sporadic.

Ominous warnings of “Looters
shot on site” are still painted on
the brick walls of homes and
businesses, a glowing reminder of
the days of anarchy immediately
following the storm. Few of the
trafﬁc lights are functional; those
that work at all ﬂicker and blink
uncertainly. Not that it matters,
since traffic laws seem to have
been washed away with the
ﬂoodwaters. Where the traffic
signals are out, stop signs have
been hastily erected, propped up
on sandbags or partially hidden
behind tree limbs or piles of trash.
Driving in new New Orleans is
strictly at your own risk.

If you travel downtown, you
will find the area which suffered
the least damage from the storm,
but which is suffering ten—fold in
its aftermath. Pre—Katrina, New
Orleans’ primary industry was
tourism.

While home for break, I went
with a friend down to the French
Quarter one night, but the streets
were eerily empty. Café du
Monde is open again and serving
beignets 24 hours a day, but they
have no one to whom they can sell
their sweets.

Those few souls adventurous
enough to come to the city on
holiday are no longer interested in
all the things in which we took
pride: the French Quarter, historic
architecture, great food and
fantastic music.

Now those who come to visit
want to see the carnage. They

“For the low price of $4] .95 per person, all the

carnage you can stomach will be shown to you

from the climate-controlled safety of a coach bus.”

To the Editor:

I would like to comment on
your recent editorial concerning
Behind Bars, the new feature to
the Phi. While I fully support the
First Amendment and enjoy the
right to free speech, as well as
my right to examine matters of
public record, I don’t support
nor understand the vindictive
nature and defense of this
feature.

The Phi writes of their
support of the “acquisition and
publication of knowledge which
is pertinent to this campus.”
How is a reproduction of police
records containing the names
and actions of fellow students

pertinent? This isn’t actual .

reporting nor is it news. It isn’t
even original. By publishing the
column, you only succeed at
making a small campus even
smaller by pointing a ﬁnger at
every student that makes a
mistake. It should never be the
responsibility of the Phi to
punish students for their actions.

They are already being punished
by the police, the university and
quite probably, their families.
Why mock them by making the
entire campus aware of what
they’ve done? This seems
entirely contrary to the founding
ideals of integrity and honor that
our founders intended to this
campus. '

Furthermore, many columns
such as Behind Bars simply use
nouns and ages to describe
arrests. Why doesn’t the Phi
utilize this format rather than
calling out specific students? I
believe it’s disrespectful to your
fellow students. Just because you
can publish it doesn’t make it
right.

A column just to “stir people
up” seems like a weak excuse to
rehabilitate an ailing paper and
certainly didn’t get me to read
any further than page 2.

want to see what happens when
the indifference of nature and the

miscalculations of human
engineering meet. And that is
exactly what they see.

Opportunists, encouraged by city
officials, have set up tour buses
to show people around the areas
hardest hit by the storm. For the
low price of $41.95 per person, all
the carnage you can stomach will
be shown to you from the climate-
controlled safety of a coach bus.

Since over three quarters of the
city still lies untouched by

, rebuilding efforts and in complete

ruin, there is no shortage of
“sights” for seeing: people’s
ruined livelihoods laid to waste
for your viewing pleasure.

I can’t decide if this is a good
effort by some to make the best of
a bad situation or if it’s just sick.

No one has stepped up to the
plate to work past the self—interest
and the bullshit politics that were
responsible for the chaos in the
days immediately following the
storm. Not one of the powers that
be is willing to step up and take
responsibility, to bear the burden
of blame and then move past it to
try and fix our broken hearts. The
potential for the “rebirth” that is
so often spoken of is there, the
people are willing. But rebirth
will not happen without leadership
and intelligence, both of which are
in short supply right now.

While the new New Orleans
searches for its new leader, it
slowly picks up the pieces of its
broken heart. Little by little,
businesses reopen. Schools are
starting to come back. We are
even having Mardi Gras this year.
Very slowly, we are picking up the
pieces and building the new New
Orleans up to its potential. Maybe
soon the tourists will start coming
down for the food and fun again.
But until then, we take it one day
at a time and tell ourselves that,
surely, things will get better.

Fancy frenzy

The hunt for a date to Fancy Dress can be a perilous adventure

HE SAID

Fancy Dress is right around
the corner, and unfortunately
y’all know what that means: it is
time to start searching for a date.
Well, before you decide that you
want to import a date from an-
other time zone or you ﬁnally
want to get up the courage to ask
your Facebook crush, let’s talk
about all the potential methods
you can use to ﬁnd the perfect
date.

There’s my favorite, the “I
asked you while blackout and
don’t remember your answer”
approach to ﬁnding the perfect
FD date. We’ve all been there. A
few Natty’s into the night, and
you’re feeling pretty good about
yourself. So you figure, I’m
drunk. She’s drunk. Let’s be
dates. However, when you wake
up the next morning, you find
yourself wondering a few things.
“Who did I ask?” or “What did
she say?” may be the questions
that plague your hangover. Don’t
worry, if your date is meant to
be, more than likely she’l1 re-
member asking and answering.
And if not, she is probably in
your 8 a.m. class waiting to laugh
at you first thing tomorrow
morning.

For those bashful folk out
there you can try the, “I’m stalk-
ing you via Facebook. Does it
scare you that I know your date
of birth and home address?”
method of finding the perfect
date for you. Okay, so maybe it
verges on stalking, but there’s
nothing wrong with making a few
new friends with the aid of the
intemet.

However, when approaching
your future date, I ’d recommend
not bringing up how you have
viewed all of their tagged pic-
tures on the Facebook over 100
times.

It will save you from some
socially awkward situations.

For those who are even too
shy to ask a random stranger that
you are stalking via the internet

to FD, you could always use the
tried and true method of having
your friends ﬁnd you a date. I
pride myself at finding great
dates for my friends.

Last year, one of my best
friends went to FD with a gentle-
man who found himself in jail at
the end of the night. I am quite
the matchmaker. Let me know if
you want me to work my magic
for you.

For those of you currently
avoiding a DTR, you could al-
ways use the “Let’s not deﬁne the
relationship. Let’s go to FD to-
gether instea ” method
to having the best
FD yet. I mean

  
 
  

SHE SAID

You think we would have
mastered it by now. I mean even
as freshmen we had homecom-
ing, Christmas weekend and
maybe even a fraternity formal
under our belt. Before that we
had prom, graduation formals
and other high school dances to
force us to ﬁnd a partner. Yet
why is that we still have not mas-
tered the art of ﬁnding a date?
Well I guess some of us have.
For those of you who have a boy-
fn'end— well, this article is not for
you. You don’t have to make any
sketchy late night trips
like the rest of us in

100k at it this our quest to ﬁnd
W 3 Y a Mr. Right or just
Y 0 U ’ V 5 Mr. RightN0w.
l'lO0l(Cd up F a n c y
With this Dress is here. I
girlafew said it. If you
hm55sWhY don’t have a
110i have date (like me as
another 20 of press time) then

around? You
already know
this person, and I mean

you don’t have to worry about
whether or not there will be an
awkward hookup at the end of
the night. This is the safe choice,
and in most cases, probably the
best choice. Also, do you really
want the girl that you’ve been
hooking up with to go with an-
other guy? I think not.

However, if all of these meth-
ods fail, you can always go with
the “We’re friends. Let’s go to-
gether.” method of finding a
date. Figure, you are going to
want a date. It’s a whole lot easier
than importing one.

So be a man about it and ask
one of your friends to go to FD
with you.

It’s a guaranteed night of fun,
and the night has endless poten-
tial. It won’t be awkward in the
end, and you will have a great
time.

You’re friends with your date
so she won’t get mad if you get
really drunk at the after party.

  
 

you have to resort to
some tried and true tac-
tics of assuring yourself a guy.
A wise man once told me, “Girls
don’t find dates, dates find
them.” I can see where he thinks
this is correct, but there is so
much in being found. You have
to place yourself perfectly be-
tween the frat basement and
nearest stash of Natty Light
within direct eyesight of the best-
looking and most fun dateless
guy at the party. Also a girl can
ask a guy to FD- yeah I said it.
It happens, but that’s not what I
am here to write about.

Now you must master the art
of positioning and location. Our
away messages become more
detailed than ever. You can tell
an especially desperate girl by
the way she lists her activities on
her instant messenger. You’re
not just at class- you’re at Span-

ish, then math, quick lunch, and
then back around 1:00. You
know not every guy will get the
hint that you are making yourself
easily accessible, but one might.
Just don’t go too overboard.
Then it’s borderline sad.

Next it’s time for the frater-
nity house shuflle. You’re just
increasing your hunting ground.
If you go to a house and come
up empty handed, at least get
yourself a drink for your good
effort. It was not in vain. Avoid
going overboard on the alcohol
on the days leading up to Fancy
Dress. You might say yes to aa
random person and then where
would you be but in an awkward
situation? FD is no place to play
blind date.

Do not import a boy unless he
is your boyfriend. The ratio is
close enough and the boys are
pretty enough. You can find
something here. I mean I guess
you could import a suitable boy,
but what would you do for din-
ner? You would spend the en-
tire night introducing him that by
the end you both would just be
annoyed. Also, you can’t hook
up with anyone else but the date
when you ship them in. That’s
just poor form.

Don’t be afraid of last ditch
efforts.
Thursday before fancy dress is a
perfectly acceptable place to ﬁnd
a date. You’re not desperate.
You know along with everyone
else that some guys don’t realize
they need a date for a date func-
tion until the night before.

Avoid a cry of desperation.
You always have your friends to
bail you out. Even if you barely
know your date, and you’re go-
ing out to eat with a bunch of
your friends, you’re going to
have fun. After all that’s really
what the night is about. And tak-
ing some fabulous party pics.

Down in the slumps

After the excitement of freshman year, sophomore girls feel the pain of neglect

By Ashley Hubbard
GUEST COLUMNIST

Last term was rough- very
rough.

I believe I actually interacted
with society, outside of class and
work, about ﬁve times in total. I
napped whenever I had a free
minute and could not seem to es-
cape a rather overwhelming
weight on my shoulders due to
either stress or an excessive
amount of cranial weight gain.

When confronted about my
recently developed isolationist
behavior, I would give my an-
swer: I am tired; I have endless
amounts of work to do, and Ire-
ally am just not up to it.

I was comforted when many
of my peers would give me an
understanding nod and pat on the
back like my mother used to do
when I would tell her the end of
the world was fast approaching,
but my comfort dissolved once

they kindly explained to me the
unavoidable cause of my plight.

The source of all my woes
was summed up by the fact that
I was a sophomore and a female;
a debilitating combination.

I was diagnosed with the
sophomore slump- the use of al-
literation indicates the high level
of education those who con-
cocted it possess.

I can only conclude that the
catchiness of the phrase is re-
sponsible for its widespread
popularity, or perhaps its popu-
larity is due to the concept’s
revolutionary premise.

For those of you who have yet
to be acquainted with the sopho-
more slump, it is the idea that as
a sophomore female I have lost
my appeal and am now in a sort
of, well, slump.

It was clear that I had grown
accustomed to the uncharacter-
istically high interest I received
from the male population during

The source of all my woes was summed up by

the fact that I was a sophomore and a female;

a debilitating combination.

my freshman year, and, because
my quality of life is wholly de-
pendent upon the amount of at-
tention I receive from the oppo-
site sex, it only makes sense that
I have had a hard time adjusting
to my new sophomore status.
The difﬁcult class schedule,
20-plus hours of workl clock per
week, regular volunteering, radio
show, sorority obligations and
general dislike of daily vitamins
had nothing to do with my ever
present feeling of blah.
Unfortunately, no solution to
this extremely healthy social
construct exists. There was little
I could do but sit in a dark cor-

ner and eat away my emotions
only to gain an additional ten
pounds which proved to even
further lessen my allure while
freshman women swarmed the
parties and monopolized the
male interest.

Theories like the sophomore
slump make me wish that our
little liberal arts school turned
out more psychology and soci-
ology majors than C-school ma-
jors because I think that society
at large could really beneﬁt from
the profound insight our school
has concerning what really mat-
ters in life.

corrections

In our Feb. 27 issue, the
Phi committed a regrettable
error.

The feature “Behind Bars,”
which appears on page 2,
chronicles and pokes fun at
student and community arrests
from the week. The reporter
treks to the police station a
few times a week, copies out
the arrest reports and then
compiles the section.

On this particular week,

a man named William Jef-
fery Moore was arrested and
charged with being drunk in
public and underage posses-
sion of alcohol. The man is
20 years old and a Lexington
resident.

James William Moore, who
attends Washington and Lee, is
19 years old and a Rockbridge
County resident. He is a Phi
Delta Theta pledge, and his
family is well-known in the
Rockbridge County area.

Unfortunately, the reporter
who compiles the police re-
ports knows Will Moore,
and made an assumption that
should not have been made.

The insult was compound-
ed by the jocular nature of the
feature, which has since been
changed to model that of the
“Rockbridge Advocate” and
“Rockbridge Weekly.”

Will Moore, who attends
Washington and Lee, was

over the Washington break.

The Phi both apologizes
to Will and his family, and
retracts the statements released
in our Feb. 27 edition.

Also in our Feb. 27 edition,
Rachael Seidenschnur was
quoted saying that Kenneth
Cribb did not always support
The Spectator during his time

not in publication when Cribb
was a student at W&L. The
Phi regrets the error.

Spring term absenc

Possible proposals include early graduation for
seniors or no Spring term for freshmen students

By Sarah Kientz
surr wnnzn

Changes to the academic
requirements of Spring term
could be coming soon, and one
potential proposal might change
the number of Spring terms
students spend on campus.

According to Provost
Thomas Williams, changes

« will be proposed to alter the

academic requirements of Spring
term. Also, students will not be
permitted to remain on campus
for all four Spring terms.

Despite the rumors that
administrators will be eliminating
Spring term altogether, Williams
said that after three years of
discussion, only a few changes
will be proposed.

One change is that students
will be required to take a 
of six credits. Currently students
are only required to have a three-
credit course load.

Dean Hank Dobin said the
changes will be made in order to
“preserve and enhance the ﬂavor
of spring term” on an academic
level. - ‘

“We’re fully committed to
keeping Spring term, but we
want to enhance it and make it
more academically rigorous,”
Dobin said. “There are proposals
to require students to take six

credits instead of the current
minimum of three.”

With students taking more
courses, Williams said that
already overloaded faculty will
need to teach more classes.

“We want to keep class size
the same, and change the faculty
teaching load to six courses, as it
had been seven,” Williams said.

Students taking more classes
and professors teaching fewer
classes present a problem,
Williams said.

Twenty—one new
undergraduate professors have
already been hired to make up for
the difference, Williams said.

However, another change that
will be made in order to ensure
students can take six credits each
Spring term is that students will
only be allowed to attend three
out of their four Spring terms,
Dobin said.

Williams said there are three
options that administrators are
still considering concerning this
issue.

One is that freshmen will
be asked to leave during their

Spring term. Another is that
seniors will graduate in April,
which, Williams said, “will be
early for the Washington and
Lee calendar, but near the same
time as many other schools.” The
third option is to give students
the choice.

Sophomore Lauren Ottaway
does not find the proposed
changes a positive idea.

“During the spring, courses
require more work and class
time,” Ottaway said. “The option
of one class should be available
if one is taking a difficult class
they want to be able to focus on
more.”

Ottaway also said that
requiring students to leave
campus for one of their Spring
terms has more drawbacks than
beneﬁts.

“I think it would be a good
idea to encourage more people
to go abroad or do internships
off campus during Spring term,”
Ottaway said, “but if you make
people go abroad during the
spring, it will discourage them
from doing programs outside

of W&L, since our schedule is
different, or going abroad for
a full semester in the fall or
winter.”

Ottaway also questioned what
effect the new policy would have
on spring athletes, tuition and
room and board, which are paid
jointly for winter and spring.

Freshman Laura King also
disagreed with the idea of leaving
for one of her future Spring
terms.

“If I’m going to be pre-
med I can’t go abroad during
a Spring term,” King said. “I
don’t understand what students
would do if they didn’t want to
go abroad or if their major forced
them to take classes during all
four spring terms.”

Ottaway said some students
might just enjoy Spring term and
not want to miss out on one.

“There are many people who
don’t want to leave campus for a
term, and I don’t think the school
should force them to.”

Williams also said that W&L’s
unique calendar is one reason
administrators are trying to retain
it. He said administrators have
been discussing possible changes
or even elimination of spring
term for about three years.

“Faculty was nearly split

“Spring term is so unique to this school that I don ’t think we
should be forced to leave for it. ”

LAURA KING, Class of 2009

 

50/50 on retaining the 12-l2-6
calendar and adopting a more
traditional semester calendar,”
Williams said. “A slight majority
preferred our current calendar
over using semesters.”

The unique opportunities that
students have during Spring term
are one reason why Williams
said the faculty chose to keep
it.

“The things that go on
during Spring term, such as
abroad programs and trips
by departments to different
locations around the world,
cannot be done in the long term
because you can’t take students
off campus when they have three
other classes,” Williams said.
“Alumni that have graduated
since 1971 [when the 12-12-6
calendar was adopted] have
loved it and are large supporters
of it.” A

King agreed that Spring term
is a unique experience, and
stressed that as the reason why
some students might not want to
leave during the spring.

“I’d rather go abroad or do
internships during the summer
than lose any time here,” King
said. “Spring term is so unique
to this school that I don’t think
we should be forced to leave
for it.”

Dobin said the proposed
changes are still being discussed
by the Courses and Degrees
committee and will go in front
of the faculty in April.

Core requirements cut back

Faculty approves reductions to literature, social sciences and humanities requirements without debate

ByJacob Geiger
N 2 w 5 £0 I T o n

The undergraduate faculty has
approved signiﬁcant changes to
Washington and Lee’s General
Education requirements and has
scheduled these changes to take
effect in the fall of 2007.

The new requirements will re-
quire one fewer literature course,
one fewer social sciences course
— drawing from economics, poli-
tics, psychology and anthropol-
ogy — and one fewer course from
the humanities - history, religion,
philosophy and ﬁne arts.

Whereas the current system
require two literature courses and
four humanities courses, the new
plan will require students to take
one course each from literature,
ﬁne arts and the other humanities
and then pick a fourth course
from any of those three groups.
The previous requirements had
students take 18 hours of classes
in literature and the humanities;
the current system requires only
12 hours.

These changes come not
long after a decision to reduce
the number of hours needed for
graduation from 121 to 115.

Though several faculty mem-
bers were interested in discuss-
ing the proposal at the faculty
meeting on Mon., Feb. 20, Mark
Rush moved for an immediate
vote and was supported by a
sufficient majority to circumvent
any debate and move straight to
a decision.

“The proposal was approved,
but the manner of anoroval was

unfortunate,” said History De-
partment Chairman Holt Mer-
chant. “We assumed there would
be a long debate but there was no
debate whatsoever.”

History professor Richard
Bidlack, who opposed the pro-
posal, argued that the reductions
are too large.

“In the new curriculum, the
number of credits for graduation
has been cut by six credits, that
is, from 121 to 115. Ifthe cuts in
Gen Ed were proportional, Gen
Ed would be reduced by three
credits because Gen Ed currently
comprises somewhat less that
half of the total curriculum. The
Gen Ed requirement, however,
was cut by nine credits.”

Both Merchant and Bidlack
speculated on how the changes
would affect the school’s liberal
arts experience; Merchant said
that nobody knows that the prac-
tical ramiﬁcations of the changes
will be.

“Students could graduate
from W&L without ever having
taken a course in history, philoso-
phy or religion,” Bidlack said.
“With such a weak humanities
requirement, it is legitimate to
ask whether we are really justi-
ﬁed in calling W&L a liberal arts
university.”

~ Merchant said the ne_w re-
quirements would allow students
to take more electives.

“Right now pre-meds have
almost no wiggle room at all,”
he said.

Dean of the College Hank
Dobin, who joined the adminis-
tration this vear from Princeton

University, said the proposed
changes came from two faculty
committees that were designated
three years ago to make recom-
mendations on the subject.

Dobin also said that most of
the proposals were already for-
mulated when they reached the
Courses and Degrees committee
for ﬁnal review. He said that he
does not think the changes will
alter W&L’s liberal arts experi-
ence.

“We require more
courses than other
schools, so I ’m con-
ﬁdent there is still a
substantive liberal

arts component to

W&L. ”

ART GOLDSMITH
Economics Professor

“The decision to cut total
credits is a complicated story,”
Dobin said. “lt’s a combination
of reducing the teaching load for
faculty combined with a deci-
sion three years ago to maintain
the current academic calendar.
The Board of Trustees has also
approved the hiring of 21 new
faculty.”

Economics professor Art
Goldsmith said the changes will
not be dramatic, but he suggested
other possible alternatives.

“The departments were also
asked to look at the size of their
majors so not all [of the] reduc-
tions would come out of Gen
Ed, but that wasn’t part of the
proposal sent onto the faculty,”
Goldsmith said.

“It’s unfortunate we didn’t
look at that issue more closely;
smaller majors would have al-
lowed, maybe, a freshman semi-
nar, something that a lot of our
peer institutions have tried with
great success.”

Bidlack suggested that offer-
ing minors might help reduce
the course load crunch that many
students face.

Since minors require fewer
courses than a second major,
students could still study in a
second area of interest while still
retaining the ﬂexibility to take
more elective classes.

Merchant said that he does not
think the changes will hurt his
department in the long run.

“We have lots of students now,
and we’ll have lots of students
forever. People study history
because they love it, not because
of Gen Ed requirements.”

Goldsmith, like Dean Dobin,
said he thinks W&L’s liberal
arts identity will be largely un-
affected.

“We require more courses
than other schools, so I’m con-
ﬁdent there is still a substantive
liberal arts component to W&L,”
said Goldsmith.

Though he said that the new
changes will not be dramatic,
Goldsmith still wishes some of
the other ideas could have been

THE RING-TUM PHI

MONDAY,

 

MARCH 6, 2006

 

 

By Katherine Greene
EDlTOR-IN-CHIEF

In a wave of controversy, As-
sociate Dean Ellen Mayock an-
nounced she would resign a year
early.

According to the memo sent
by Dean Hank Dobin to faculty
and staff members on Tuesday,
Feb. 28, Mayock decided to leave
her position, “to return full-time
to teaching and research.”

The memo also suggested that
some problems with Mayock’s
contract may have prompted the
resignation.

“I was simply asking them to

BA RS

put into writing what I under-
stood to be the original terms of
my contract,” she said.

Dobin’s memo said, “the
University has agreed to honor
all the terms of her compensa-
tion.”

As Mayock had previously
understood her contract, she
said, the normal length of a term
would be three years.

But she said that in the de-
bate which lasted several weeks,
there was some “turmoil.”

“I was offered the ﬂexibility
to step down,” she said.

Dobin declined to comment
on the situation, and interim

President Beckley referred only
to Dobin’s memo.

One student said she found
something wrong with the treat-
ment of the only female academic
dean.

Paton Hughes has begun a pe-
tition with her friends and other
concerned students to show a pro-
test of the treatment of women in
the administration.

“We ﬁnd it incredible that
the administration can’t ﬁnd and
maintain a woman,” she said.

Hughes’s group intends to
meet Tuesday to discuss a pos-
sible “silence protest,” which
involves placing duct tape over

idea that women on campus are
being silenced.

Mayock said she has nothing
to do with the women organizing
the protest.

“I wouldn’t directly encourage
anyone to act on my behalf,” she
said.

Mayock also suggested that
her teachings of “activism, as well
as forthrightness, candor, and car-
ing for other human beings,” may
have spurred the support from the
students.

Hughes said, “She deals with a
lot of issues that others don’t.”

A campus known for its long military tradition

fails to recognize the service of alumni veterans

and staff members now working for the school.

By Jessica Shaw
nrponrrn

When Director of Public Safe-
ty Mike Young turned 21, it was
no ordinary day.

He spent it in Vietnam.

When a Washington and Lee
student turns 21, it is a big deal--
a night at the Palms, a celebration
with friends, a license to drink
alcohol legally. This is a typical
night for coming of age.

What many do not know, is
that numerous faculty and staff
at this school never experienced
a celebration for their twenty-ﬁrst
birthday. Known or unknown,
Vietnam and Korean War veter-
ans reside among students on this
campus. These heroes want des-
perately for students to attain an
appreciation for their freedom.

“Students generally are into
their own lives,” Young said.
“They forget the reason they have
that life.”

Young served in the military
from 1966-1969. He now co-co-

ordinates Veteran’s Day ceremo-
nies with Vietnam veteran Tim
Kolly to recognize and remem-
ber all who served. He said this
also honors those who did not
receive gratitude at the time.

“If you’ve studied any his-
tory about the Vietnam War,
there was a lot of protest. A lot
of people opted out of service by
staying in school. A lot of people
that I knew in the ’50’s and ’60’s
were protesting the war while I
was ﬁghting it.”

Because of the ﬁerce oppo-
sition to the war, soldiers were
treated poorly upon their return
to America.

“They would treat you like
you were less than dirt,” Young
said. “It got to the point where I
wouldn’t tell anyone I was a Viet-
nam veteran.”

He emphasized that the sol-
diers representing this country
must be respected.

So far, Veteran’s Day ceremo-
nies have been small, consisting
only of a few law students, fac-
ulty and staff members. Young
said they would love to see more
participation.

According EC President Char-
lie Yates, many students are un-
aware of alumni, faculty and staff
involvement overseas.

“Its hard without being per-
sonally connected,” he said.
“We’re so prosperous as a nation,
that it’s easy to lose sight of the
sacriﬁces some people make.”

There are currently ten W&L
students involved in the ROTC
program at Virginia Military Insti-

ROTC, so its not a thing [students] have to

deal with a lot. ”

tute. According to freshman Sean
McKinley, the level of awareness
on this campus is minimal.

“There [are not] a lot of stu-
dents that are in ROTC, so it’s
not a thing [students] have to deal
with a lot,” McKinley said. “It’s
not a normal part of Washington
and Lee discussion. They are in-
terested in their own lives and
school, but students [need] to be
more aware of what their peers
outside of W&L are doing.”

Yates suggested a plan to have
veterans and alumni speak to the
student body as a method to in-
crease campus knowledge.

“A lot of W&L students would
be interested to know what alums
are serving in Iraq and Afghani-
stan,” Yates said. “What you
don’t want to do is accuse people
of being ignorant. Once they are
aware, they will pay attention.”

Young agreed that student
awareness is a step in the right
direction.

“I would like every student to
know what this is all about so that
they would have a gauge of what
kids their age went through at the
same time,” he said. “It’s alien to
a lot of people here what service
to this country means. The rea-
son this country is the way it is,
is because people have died and
served.”

In two separate articles, she is
accused of extreme liberalism in

“She took a lot of hits from

both alumni and students,”
Hughes said.
Mayock calls herself a politi-

cal moderate, and said she is sur-
prised at her role as a “beacon of
the left.”

Several rumors have circulat-
ed about campus that Mayock’s
controversial politics may have
led to her resignation.

But Mayock points to the

confusion over the terms of her
contract.

Dobin publicly thanked

help in learning the ways of the
school.

Robbery
spree comes
to an end

Police arrest man visiting
Lexington for funeral

By Jacob Geiger
u 2 w s so I r o R

Lexington police re-
cently found a suspect in
a short, intense string of
robberies.

Greggory Coffey of
Portsmouth, Virginia was
arrested and charged after
a ﬁve~day robbery spree
that included numerous
break-ins into both homes
and vehicles.

Police Chief Bruce
Beard says his depart-
ment thinks Coffey was
in town from about Sun.,
Feb. 19 until Thur., Feb.
23, when he was arrested
by Sgt. Miller of the Lex-
ington police force.

“We think he was
here to attend his grand-
mother’s funeral,” Beard
said.

As of Feb. 28, the
city of Lexington was
charging Coffey with six
counts of grand larceny,
one count of burglary
and a charge of posses-
sion of a firearm by a
felon. Miller added that
Coffey also faces four
more felony charges in
the county.

“I’ve got three more

charges I could add on-

but haven’t yet,” Miller
said. “He’s already on
probation from another
felony so he’s got an
automatic ﬁve years for
the gun charge.”
According to Miller,
the burglar’s methods
were simple yet smart.
“He’d go up and try
a door, and if it was un-
locked he’d just slipin.

People saw him, but he I

would’ve just looked like
another contractor doing
work on a house,” Miller
said. “He did everything
in broad daylight.”

The burglar would
also sit in people’s cars
while going through their
belongings. Beard says

that the accused thief
only had to break into
two locked houses and '
one car; everything else,
including, Beard said, the
residence of a Washing-
ton and Lee law student,
was already unlocked.

Miller stressed that

students and other resi-
dents need to look their
doors.
I ' “Please emphasize to
the students how im-
portant it is to lock your
door,” Miller said.

Coffey’s arrest came
about in an unusual
manner. According to
Miller, W&L campus
security saw Coffey cut-
ting through campus on
Feb. 23.

Obtaining a partial
license plate number, the
security officer called
the police, who began
searching Lexington for
the car.

After failing to find a
matching tag in the city,
police expanded their‘
search outside the city
limits. -
“Eventually,” Mill-
er said, “we found the
truck at the Comfort Inn,
and it was full of stuff.
We weren’t originally
suspecting him of the
robberies,‘but when we
asked the owner of the
truck — Coffey’s mother
~— to come look at all the ‘
stuff she said she didn’t
know anything about
it.”

At that point, around
12:30 pm., Miller ar-
rested Coffey.

Though the police de-
partment is working to
return theistoien items,
most have already been
returned. Miller is inves-

I tigating whether Coifey

was involved with other *
recent robberies that have

not been solved. The to-

tal value of the items sto- _ .
len is currently estiniated _

at around $8,000.

Depth key to wins

UConn looking to gain second championship in three years

ByThomas Gift
srrrr warren

This year’s UConn team is
neither the most talented nor the
most skilled group of players that
Jim Calhoun has ever assembled
in Storrs, Connecticut. The 1999
team of Richard “Rip” Hamilton,
Khalid ElAmin, and Ricky Moore
certainly possessed more talent.
The 2004 team of Ben Gordon,
Emeka Okafor, and Taliek Brown
possessed more skill. And yet,
there still exists very little doubt
that the Huskies will be cutting
down the nets at the RCA Dome
in Indianapolis come April 3"’.

The reason? UConn’s depth.
Although plenty of teams can
equal the talent and skill of UCo-
nn’s starting ﬁve, no one comes
close to matching the ﬁrepower of
their bench. Calhoun has a seem-
ingly unlimited string of players
at his disposal when the game is
on the line. In fact, nearly every
player on UConn’s bench would
be guaranteed a starting position

at another Division I school — in-
cluding the likes of Duke, Mem-
phis, Villanova, and Gonzaga.
For example, senior Denham
Brown, who once scored lll
points in a high-school contest
and is averaging 9.4 points per
game this year, has turned out to
be one of UConn’s most clutch
scorers. His last second-shot to
win the Maui Invitational secured
an early-season championship for
the Huskies, and set the tone for a
season of dazzling offensive play.
Additionally, senior Hilton
Armstrong, who did not even
make UConn’s starting ﬁve at the
beginning of the year, is now be-
ing considered a legitimate ﬁrst-
round NBA draft pick. His 10.0
points and 6.8 rebounds per game
have proved valuable when the
Huskies have squared off against
teams with strong front courts.
Finally, ﬁfth-year senior Ed
Nelson, who was named ACC
Rookie of the Year at Georgia
Tech before transferring to UConn
in 2002, has been the emotional
leader for Calhoun’s squad. The

Tough ODAC run

begins next week
Golf team predicted to ﬁnish third

By Elliott Walker
surr w ll I TE R

The golf team will start the
second half of their season Mar.
13-14 at the Lee Nissan-Barton

.M3¥¥'W3Sl1l0Q¥0nr College Intercollegiate at Wilson
3 p.m. Country Club in Wilson, NC.
The ﬁrst half of their season
took place in the fall.

The team competed in four
tournaments, ﬁnishing ﬁrst out of
12 teams at the Virginia State In-
tercollegiate Championship.

At the end of last season, the
team was ranked thirteenth in the
nation.

On Feb. 9, the ODAC picked
the team to ﬁnish third of nine
teams in the league. '

The team will face tough com-
petition if they -wish to earn the
ODAC title this year.

Guilford returns as defending
national champions this season,
and Randolph-Macon won the
ODAC title last year.

Ted Williams, captain of the

team, is optimistic and said the
team does believe they are capa-
ble of being ODAC champs.

“We have some talented fresh-
men and sophomores and some
craﬂy veteran players,” he said.

Williams credits their success
to hard work during their season
and even harder workouts in the
gym during the off-season.

The team’s only home touma-
ment, the W&L Buck Leslie Invi-
tational, will be held at the Lex-
ington Golf and Country Club on
Apr. 17-18,

The tournament usually draws
around 50 spectators per day.

It might be because “golfers
normally are good-looking nice
guys who women are attracted
to,” said to Williams. “Our fan
base is wide and good looking.”

The golf team has a lot going
for them with their good looks,
handsome fans and extraordinary
talent.

Look for them to accomplish
great things this spring season.

contributions that Nelson brings
to UConn through his physical

on-the-court play and intense off-
the-court personality cannot be
quantiﬁed into numbers. When
go—to-players Rudy Gay, Marcus
Williams, and Josh Boone are
having off-nights, it is always
Nelson who seems to pick up the
slack for the Huskies.

Ranked number two in both
the AP Poll and the ESPN/USA
Today Coaches’ Poll, the Huskies
are one of the favorites to win
this year’s NCAA Championship.
They’ve also already clinched the
ﬁrst seed and a ﬁrst-round bye in
the Big East Conference touma-
ment this week.

But Calhoun’s words reﬂect
those of a seasoned veteran who
refuses to let hype overshadow
UConn’s ultimate goal: “It’s al-
ways good to be number one in
anything, but it’s not great at this
time of year. I want it at the begin-
ning of April.”

Fortunately for Calhoun, his
team’s depth should be enough to
give him just what he wants.

“Nearly every player on UConn is bench would be guaran-

teed a starting position at another Division I school. ”

Poised to dominate ODACS

Despite losses, men is tennis looks to win 11th straight title

ByMikeFahey
STAFF WRITER

Records can often be
deceiving, as 5-4 would
not appear to be the record
of the ODAC leader and
perennial champion.

However, in the case
of the Washington and
Lee men’s tennis team,
records are deceiving, and
the team, ranked eleventh
nationally, has had many
difficult matches at the
start of their season. While
playing both Division I
and nationally- ranked Di-
vision III teams, the Gen-
erals have had a slow start
to their spring season.

With more conference
play in the near future,
the team is expected to
continue with its winning
traditions.

As sophomore Nat Es-
tes said, “I’d say the team
has started oﬂ° a little slow,
with some injuries affect-
ing the process, but things
are coming along.”

The team has been on

Eichenberger has

been

a winning record lately, as
sophomore Nelson Bunn
was recently named ODAC
Player of the Week. Bunn
had a great week, leading
the Generals in singles and
doubles in wins over Vir-
ginia Wesleyan and Emory
and Henry. ’

Leading the way for
W&L has also been cap-
tains David Shay and
Charles Anderson.

As Bunn said, “The
team has had great lead-
ership this year with two
seniors as our captains.
Every member of the
team helps carry the team
as a whole in each of our
matches.”

Also playing large roles
for the Generals in the top
singles and doubles spots
have been senior Jordan
Eichenberger, junior Jon
Malooly and sophomore
Seth Feibelman. Malooly
has been a strong com-
petitor, playing one of the
top singles spots, while

dominant at both singles and
doubles. Feibelman has had
great results playing both
singles and doubles. Estes
came back from a rough
injury during last season to
have a strong spring. He’s
been a force for the Gener-
als, playing both singles and
doubles.

As the season approach-
es the midway mark, Bunn
is conﬁdent in its ability.
He said, “I feel that every-
one on the team has indi-
vidual things that they need
to work on, but with a little
extra etfort and hard work,
the season should be very
successful, hopeﬁrlly cul-
minating in another ODAC
championship and a bid to
the NCAA toumey.”

Estes talked about an
upcoming battle with Cam-
egie Mellon as well as an-
other match against Mary
Washington as those that
will truly test the squad.
He said, “We really want to
beat [them].”

99 YEARS IN THE MAKING
The evolution of Fancy Dress

By Kate Shellnutt
STA FF W RITER

Over the years, many ques-
tions have been asked about the
school’s Fancy Dress Ball.

One of them includes, “What
would Stonewall Jackson think
of the youth of Lexington danc-
ing to licentious German or
disgusting racket?” (asked by an
early observer).

That’s not the question this
article is going to answer.

Because Fancy Dress’ ap-
peal comes from its over-the—top
nature-—the large budget, school-
wide attendance, elaborate deco-
rations, and ﬂashy theme--this ar-
ticle will respond to the question:
has Fancy Dress always been this
way? Is the tradition of Fancy
Dress one of extravagance?

According to the Ring-tum
Phi, the ﬁrst annual Fancy Dress
Ball could only boast “30 cou-
ples and quite a number of stags,

all in fancy dress costumes” in
attendance on Feb. 12, 1907.

Through the ’80s, Fancy
Dress was held on weekday
nights. The ﬁrst Fancy Dress Ball
was held on a Tuesday. ‘

Despite the small crowd and
only $42 budget, the acclaimed
Fancy Dress founder librarian
Annie Jo White hung evergreens,
Japanese lanterns and mural
draperies, "threw confetti and
hired the Virginia Military Insti-
tute orchestra to perform.

The next day, students in the
whole state of Virginia were call-
ing it “the most brilliant event of
the season.”

Once Fancy Dress became an
established tradition in 1913, its
attendance rose. Female students
from neighboring schools would
hope to get “the Bid” to come to
Washington and Lee’s midwinter
dance.

W&L fraternities would have
parties the weekends prior to ﬁnd

dates, not unlike the Pink Palace
parties of recent years.

When Fancy Dress was a
ﬁgure dance, “Home Sweet
Home” would be played at 2 a.m.
to signal the dance’s end. The
song’s lyrics remind listeners of
what seems to be the opposite of
Fancy Dress extravagance-—the
simple life.

A 1972 issue of the Phi
warned readers of the problems
caused by student drinking at the
dance. It reads, “Anyone...seen at
the ball with any kind of drink or
bottle other than the beer being
so1d...will be removed from his
bottle, removed from the dance
or both.”

Co-education brought women
to the school for the 1986 Fancy
Dress Ball, but instead of taking
advantage of the 13:1 male to fe-
male ratio, most female students
asked Hampton-Sydney or Uni-
versity of Virginia boys as dates.

That year, the budget reached

$65,000.

, As an aside——perhaps the
$35/couple tickets were a little
pricey that year. An advertise-
ment from White Front Grocery
markets sale-priced Pabst Blue
Ribbon, New York strip, Rich-
food soda and Pringles Cheez-
Urns as their “Fancy Dress
Special.”

Attendance peaked with
3,500 ball-goers in both 1977
and 1991.

The event’s planners have
built the appeal of Fancy Dress
with performers and decorations:
camels, llamas, belly dancers,
fortune tellers, carousel horses
and authentic reenactments.

This year’s “big element,”
according to Fancy Dress com-
mittee member Stephanie Jordon,
was the light-up dance ﬂoor.

She said students can “expect
a lot more” for next year’s one
hundredth Fancy Dress celebra-
tion.

    

One of the few bold ones to adhere to the
"Studio 54”theme, 'unior Michele Theroux
borrowed a dress t at knows disco--her

mother's prom dress from 1978.

F LASHBACK

“My sophomore year, the theme was Willy
Wonka. That was the ﬁrst FD that my husband,
Adam, and I had been dating-, and it was the

most fun I had ever had at a formal. ”

“The decorations were also really fun because
people starting taking them apart and playing
with them. Adam and I played mini kickball for

a little while with
a gumdrop. ”

“We wore Chuck
Taylors, which

I editor

J-school responds
to broadcast mailer

To the Editor:

We in the Journalism Depart-
ment would like to respond to the
campus-wide message sent out
Wednesday criticizing a feature
that has been running on page 2
of the Ring-tum Phi for several
weeks now. The Department of
Journalism and Mass Communi-
cations has no connection with
the Phi nor with any student pub-
lication. Like our Honor system,
these publications are run by stu-
dents, and mainly for students,
a W&L tradition that fits this
university’s deep commitment
to individual responsibility and
trust. But, while the journalism
professors keep our distance, we
think the message sent out to the
entire community on Wednesday
reﬂects several misunderstand-
ings that need to be addressed.

First of all, the Phi does n_ot
have “the right to print whatever it
pleases.” Newspapers, even inde-
pendent student newspapers, are
bound by all sorts of constraints,
from the role and responsibility
of journalists as the information
providers in a free society, to
standards of accuracy and fair-
ness, to legal constraints includ-
ing libel law. Those constraints
serve both to give journalists a
template against which to mea-
sure their own performance and
to ensure the free ﬂow of infor-
mation that is critical to empow-
ering citizens.

That makes another assertion
in the statement particularly curi-

ous — that a matter of public re-
cord and reader interest -- police
incident reports involving W&L
students -- ought to be with-
held from a student newspaper
because they cause unnecessary
distress for the students who have
been charged. Is W&L really this
set apart? If there is to be any
zone of “public life” on an other-
wise insulated campus, we would
think this would be it — arrest
records. The names of arrested
persons routinely appear in com-
munity newspapers across the
nation. Is it a violation of W&L’s
standards of civility and respect
for such information to appear
as well in a campus newspaper?
This, it seems to us, is suggesting
that j oumalism itself is a violation
of W&L’s “keep it in the family”
culture. It’s an interesting point
of view, but we disagree. If the
Phi editors’ primary criterion for
deciding what should be reported
is whether some might ﬁnd the
reporting uncivil, then the W&L
community will be poorly served
by its student media, and that
community will ultimately suf-
fer.

This is not to defend the way
that the Phi has laced the police
shorts with catty commentary.
Such commentary would never
appear in a mainstream news-
paper. It is for the Phi to learn
what is appropriate for student
journalism. Certainly, cattiness
is a feature of many a campus
newspaper, but the combination

in “Behind Bars” perhaps needs
revisiting. That is a matter for the

' student staff, not Reid Hall.

The Phi printed a noxious er-
ror this week, mistaking someone
who had been arrested for a W&L
student. Errors of fact ought to
be acknowledged, apologized
for and corrected, as the Phi has
done. Errors and misjudgments
are committed by all news out-
lets, including student media, but
we don’t believe that that justiﬁes
favoring a civil community over
an informed one.

Student questions Phi’s intent

To the Editor:

I do not understand the point
of the Phi ’s section where you ex-
pose all the crimes that W&L stu-
dents to the community and their
parents. The current issue of you
publicly accusing someone of
falsely committing a crime aside,
this section makes public very
negative and sometimes sensitive
information about our students
and casts thepaper and university

in college, the consequences of
which are more than visited upon
them by the Lexington police.
What are you really achieving by
informing the entire student body
and the alumni community about
some of our student body’s trans-
gressions? I’m sure you have
some justiﬁcation, but I think you
would be wise to consider how
this section appears to the stu-
dents, and the image it creates of

would be much better served by
an intelligent editorial or other-
wise inforrnative article in the
place of the police beat, which is
essentially tattle-taling. Let the
local newspapers spend their time
chronicling all the little problems
that our students get into, as the
paper of a respected academic in-
stitution, spend your time writing
substance of academic merit.

  Faculty ready

for Ruscio era

President-elect
receives favorable
reception from
faculty and staff’

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS EDITOR

Three weeks after being
named Washington and Lee’s
twenty-sixth president, Ken Rus-
cio is eager to step into his new
responsibilities and return to the
institution he has been a part of
since 1972.

Ruscio, who graduated from
W&L with a politics degree in
1976, is leaving the University
of Richmond’s Jepson School of
Leadership Studies, where he has
been the dean since 2002. While
the Jepson School had 12 faculty
members and 200 students, Rus-
cio will now deal with the thou-
sands of people who make up the
W&L community: undergraduate
and law students, faculty, staff,

    

administrators and alumni.

“The Jepson School is an in-
terdisciplinary program looking
at leadership in society, teaching
students for and about leader-
ship,” Ruscio said.

When asked how he would
transition from heading a small
school to leading a nationally rec-
ognized university, Ruscio talked
about the Jepson School’s high
proﬁle.

“The Jepson
School is an in-
teresting place;
its impact is
not measured
by its size. It
has a national
proﬁle and is
the only school
of leadership in
the country. I
represented the school at national
and international forums and ex-
plained the school.”

Ruscio, who served W&L as
the Dean of Freshmen, the Asso-
ciate Dean of the Williams School
and as a politics professor, said
his long association with the uni-

Ken Ruscl

versity will serve him well during
his stay in the Lee House.

“I have a great love for this
place,” Ruscio said, “and I think
I’ve taken lessons of Washington

and Lee to helping me understand .

what higher education is about.
My involvement in the broader
world has helped me understand
Washington and Lee better and
helped me realize Washington
and Lee can be a model for liberal
arts in ways that the university
doesn’t fully realize.”

Ruscio believes his status as
an alumnus will help him with
alumni relations when the time
comes to make difficult or contro-
versial decisions.

“There’s more at Washington
and Lee that unites us than di-
vides us,” Ruscio said. ‘‘I want
to remind people of our common
purpose; there’s not much divi-
sion on fundamental vision and
purpose.”

Ruscio said that he thinks the
university’s fundamental purpose
is “preparing students to leaders

City water
contaminated

By Mary Chllds
STAFF WRITER

 

Lexington residents
have received a letter say-
ing that the city water failed
a health department inspec-
tion.

The letter, distributed by
the Lexington Department
of Public Works on March
17, detailed the violation of
the drinking water standard
to be levels of haloacetic
acids exceeding the maxi-
mum contaminant level
(MCL) of 60 parts per bil-
lion.

Lexington drinking wa-
ter samples had 94.8 parts
per billion.

The letter, required by
the state law to notify citi-
zens of such health‘ risks,
also said that excessive
amounts of haloacetic acid
could lead to an increased
risk of cancer.

David Woody, direc-
tor of the Lexington De-
partment of Public Works,
said that the risk of cancer

comes from drinking two
liters of the contaminated
water a day for 70 years.

He added that in cases
such as this one, Brita ﬁl-
ters and other water puriﬁ-
ers do not help.

The increased level of
haloacetic acid, or HAA5,
is a by-product of the chlo-
rine used to clean the water
supply.

“Basically, we treat the
water with chlorine to kill
the bacteria that’s in the
river water, to prepare it
for transmission and use by
the general public. There’s
also a measurement to de-
termine how much is still
left in there, and they felt
that the amount of chlorine
still left in the water was
slightly higher than what it
should have been,” Woody
said. “That’s where we
went into violation.”

Going forward, Woody
says that the Maury Service
Authority is looking into-

Sense ofdireetiori

Four theater majors put their skills to use
by casting, eostuming and directing One Acts

ByAbri Nelson
STAFF WRITER

What happens when you
take mayﬂies, a mailman, a
failing marriage and a dream
about an ex-lover and put them
all together? This year’s One
Acts, put on by the students in
Professor J .D. Martinez’s Di-
recting II class.

This year, four juniors de-
cided to take the class. Each
of them read at least 50 plays
before deciding which to cast,
rehearse and direct for the stu-
dent body.

One Acts have “always
been a laboratory for the stu-
dent directors to practice their
craft,” said Martinez. “Once
they are in rehearsal, I advise
only.”

Directing II is not a require-
ment for the theater major, but
many students choose to take
it to get a better sense of what
goes into creating a play and to

enhance their own acting skills.

“I really love performing,”
said Lauren Kampf. “I love
to entertain and make people
laugh.”

Kampf directed a play by
David Ives called “Time Flies”
about two mayflies who real-
ize how little time they have to

live on earth. Mayﬂies are a
type of fly that only lives for an
average of 24 hours.

“It captures how we have
to live every moment to its
ﬁillest,” said Kampf. She said
that she chose it for its quirky
humor and that she enjoyed
working with all the creative
people at Washington and Lee.

Auditions were held for
One Acts before the Washing-
ton Break. All the actors were
auditioned at once, and the
directors were able to choose
which roles they felt people
would ﬁt in the best.

“I feel that my cast is
superb in their roles," said
Michael Wagoner, who is di-
recting the play “Portrait of a
Madonna” by Tennessee Wil-
liams.

The play follows the psy-
chological downfall ofa 1940s
Southern woman who is feel-
ing out of place in her world.
She has a dream one night
about an ex-lover, and be-
corﬁes increasingly delusional
“until she reaches the breaking
point.”

Wagoner said that directing
has helped him to gain a better
understanding of theater as a
collaboration of skills, rather
than just being all about the ac-

tors or all about the directors.

Malinda Smith agreed. She
said that she has been amazed
watching everything come
together for her play written
by Randy Noojin, “You Can’t
Trust the Male.”

“I have an absolutely won-
derful cast,” said Smith. She
said that she chose her play for
its simple, but humorous, tell-
ing of a love story between a
woman and her mailman who
reads her mail and ﬁnds out
that she is taking a Spanish
class, so he signs up for the
class, too, so that he can ask
her on a date.

After casting and ﬁnding
other students to ﬁll the techni-
cal, lighting, costurriing and
stage managing roles on stage,
the directors moved to rehears-
als for their plays.

Students involved spent
time getting to know the script,
setting themselves up on stage
in a process called blocking,
and putting all the elements
together for the ﬁnal run-
throughs this past week.

“They need autonomy in
order to experience the chal-
lenges and joys of directing a
play,” said Martinez.

Sheryl Silvers is directing a
play by Eugene O’Neill called

A .

EMILY HULEN / Design Director

Cody Gabbard’s character confronts his wife, played by Elisa Turner, about her affair.

“Recklessness” which is about
a woman who is caught in
inﬁdelity to her husband by a
former lover. There is some vi-
olent action in her play, so they
set up a rehearsal to practice
combat ﬁghting outside of the
regular rehearsal schedule.
Silvers has been involved
in theater all of her life and she
hopes to make a career out of
it. This summer she is going
to be in New York as an acting

and directing intern.

Kampf said that she wanted
to keep her options open, but
that she would love to make
a career out of her acting and
singing talents.

Smith is graduating this
year. She would like to work
for the National Park Service
as a ranger, and she feels that
a lot of the skills she learned
through directing and acting
will help her in that role.

Wagoner agreed. He said,
“The real skills in directing are
organization, communication,
patience. trust and leadership.
These are skills that anyone
can use in just about any job
ﬁeld they pursue.”

All four directors said that
they were very excited for
the performances. Martinez
said, “It often ends up being a
wonderful and sometimes zany
night in the theater.”

While our school is pretty great, certain parts are in need of a facelift

HE SAID

So after spending the better
part of the last week watching
all three seasons of Nip/Tuck, I
started to think about how W&L
is really in need of a major facelift
on the Colonnade. .

Now don’t get me wrong. The
Colonnade is one of the coolest
things here at W&L. It is almost
even majestic.

However, as the strategic plan
outlined, the Colonnade is long
overdue for some overhaul. So
I decided to submit a few ideas
aboutﬁhow I would like to see the

.¢‘Colonnade improved for the bet-
ter.

While the Colonnade is beau-
tiful to look at, a historic appear-
ance on the outside doesn’t allow
for a historic appearance on the
inside.

The old desks that might be the
most uncomfortable things I have
ever tried to sit in are enough to
discourage me from going to class
on any given day.

I believe that all the desks
shouldtbe modeled like the ones
in the C-School. I took some of
the best naps in my life while try-
ing to make it through Politics
100.

So please help out my cam-
paign of being able to sleep
through class by make the chairs
comfy enough for me to catch
a little shut eye. Perhaps if you
_made beds an option for seating

I ,
~'Ti‘1 classes, 8 a.m. class attendance

would be a little bit higher.

It would be nice to able to
lounge around and just chill while
taking notes. You wouldn’t even
have to change out of your paja-
mas.

I’d also like to request large
classrooms. Not larger class sizes,
but large classrooms themselves.
That way, I won’t have to sit
down next to the girl I awkwardly
tried to hit on or make out with
the night before. T

here’s nothing worse than cop-
ing with the memories of the night
before, but having to sit next to
the people that you humiliated
yourself in front of is a fate worse
than death.

I’d also like to request more
comfortable lounge areas in all

of the building of the Colonnade.
Perhaps model them like the J-
School. '

Sometimes I like to hang out
in the J-School just to make use of
their plasma screen TV. Would it
also be possible to get more vend-
ing machines on campus? Maybe
even allow Starbucks to come
onto campus?

Nothing sounds better than
a few espresso shots while I’m
cramming for my ﬁnals.

And having a self-serve sta-
tion would let it be open 24 hours
a day.

I mean the Co—op is
only opened until
midnight, but an
all-night cof-

  
 
  
  
  

SHE SAID

This week I let my coconspir-
ator pick the topic, and due to a
recent addition to Nip/Tuck, he
came up with a facelift concept.
If we were given “x” amount of
dollars, what would we do to
change our beloved institution?

If anyone touches the exterior
of the Colonnade may their hands
whither and fall off. I love how
our school looks. I love when
people talk about how “pretty”
our campus is.

It makes the million

ask of a person to try and
climb all of the stairs of Newcomb
while painstakingly hung over.

Granted, elevators might in-
crease the tendency of packing on
the freshman 15, but it also might
increase the number of people go-
ing to the gym.

More importantly, it will also
set up the awkward situation that
I love to be a part of.

My personal favorite is when
you get trapped on an elevator
with someone you have met be-
fore but don’t remember their
name, or as one friend told me,
how she got trapped on a library
elevator with the guy that she
used to randomly hookup with
freshman year.

Also, I’d like to point out that
these absurd suggestions are in
true sarcasm and jest. I do not re-
ally expect any of these things to
happen, but after the fallout I re-
ceived from wanting to facebook
while at sporting events, I just
thought I ’d comment that these
are absurd suggestions meant to
be funny. Not real ideas I expect
to see happen.

Everyone always talks
about how awful it looks. And
when I’m pulling an all-nighter I
don’t want to have to stare at the
ugly brown and orange decor.

It is honestly depressing due to
half of the building being shut off
from natural light (the sun not the
beer). The other half looks upon
the outside world to face Woods
Creek apartments. I am not even
going to go there as I have de-
cided to stick to strictly academic
buildings.

Besides making the world a
better place to look at, this school
needs to also consider increasing
the size of bathrooms. I, as a fe-
male, know I need at least two to
three other friends to come with
me.

It’ s something we have been
taught from birth- there’s strength
in numbers. But it’s a little
crammed in there- especially if
someone else and their buddies
stumble in. We are solving the
world’s problems, or at least dis-
cussing the previous night’s more
interesting tidbits. We need more
room.

Speaking of bigger things,
why not increase desk size? I
often ﬁnd myself juggling three
things at once in a class and hav-
ing a larger work area would real-

ly help me out. That way I could
continue to take notes on what
the professor is saying while do-
ing my homework from last night
and preparing for the quiz in my
next class. If it’s an off day and
I don’t have pounds upon pounds
of work handed to me, a larger
desk would allow me to get that
little quick cat nap in when pos-
sible. The minutes will add up
to make up for a late night out at
Windfall.

What would also help me get
through those rougher days and
even rougher all— nighters, would
be easier access to those caffein-
ated beverages we so much love.
Whether it’s a diet coke or a cap-
puccino you long for at 2:00 AM,
a co-op closing at midnight just
doesn’t cut it.

When I need to be woken up,
I need to get to it fast. Perhaps
more vending machines on cam-
pus that can take cash and general
debit would be a good investment.
I know Chinese history would
make much more sense with one
of my beloved beverages in hand.

If there’s one thing that this
campus needs more than any-
thing, it is more parking spaces.
I notice it, and I live on campus.
People drive through the quad,
parking deck, and other random
areas numerous times in hopes
that a spot will open up.

In getting more spots we could
eliminate the rule that denies
those living in a certain radius to
drive to campus. Next year, come
winter term, that walk to the hill
is going to be looking longer and
harder each day, especially as the
temperature drops.

As a double major with art his-
tory, I would like to take the time
to bid farewell to Dupont Hall.
Sometimes it seems that you only
have two classrooms- one for art
and one for music, but you still
demand respect even if you are
opposite to completely tech—ed
out J -school.

On certain days when I am sen-
sitive to light, opening the door to
a darkened classroom makes my
day a whole lot brighter. Dupont-
you are truly sympathetic to the
plight of at least one student on
this campus.

In conclusion, demolish the
library, increase caffeine access,
make bigger desks, and please
do not hesitate to hand out more
phone numbers of your fellow
teammates on Monday Night

Standing in no
man’s shadow

Dr. Mimi Elrod continues to
play inﬂuential roles in the
W&L community and beyond

By Bree Melton
smrr wnmzn

As her husband grew to
be one of the most beloved
presidents of the univer-
sity, Dr. Mimi Elrod found
herself in the spotlight.
She said that the “rela—
tionship of a husband and
wife...plays out in a more
public way” when one is in
visible position.

She believes the rela-
tionship she had with Dr.
John Elrod helped to set
an example for the men
at Washington and Lee as
the school transitioned to
coeducation in those ﬁrst
years.

Elrod said she will not
take much recognition for
her inﬂuence on the uni-
versity.

She said, “I can’t take
a lot of credit for shaping
programs.” Since she was
“in a visible position,” she
did have a lot of impact on
how the university has pro-
gressed.

When she was ﬁrst in
Lexington, Elrod worked
closely with the Head Start
program until 1986 when
she started in the admis-
sions office. But coming
from a family that was
very politically active and
having her bachelor’s de-
gree in political science, it
was not long before Elrod
moved onto the political
scene.

In 2002 Elrod ran for
District 24’s seat in the
House of Delegates against
Republican Ben Cline. Al-
ways setting the example
as strong woman, Elrod
said, “Whenever a woman
does something that is tra-

ditionally a man’s role, it
shows [other women what
can be done].”

Though she was defeat-
ed in the close race, just
running was a victory, she
said. Elrod is still much
invested in the Lexington
community.

Today, in addition to
heading up the Summer
Scholars Program at W&L,
Elrod is on the Lexington
City Council.

With education always a
prevalent issue in her mind,
Elrod was appointed to the
State Council of High Edu-
cation Executive Commit-
tee by Governor Mark War-
ner in 2003. She said that
it has been a great learning
experience because, though
it addresses both public
and private institutions, the
focus is mostly on public
education.

Now that Tim Kaine is
the governor of Virginia,
Elrod hopes that she will
be able to serve on the
committee again as she has
thoroughly enjoyed the ex-
perience.

Elrod, ever an example,
said “You think you’ll go in
one direction in your life,
but you just don’t know
what direction life is going
to take you. You have to
embrace what’s in front of
you.”

Elrod has been a testa-
ment to this philosophy.
Education and poverty
have always been central
issues to her, and in her life
she as made sure to address
those no matter where she
was.

Finally, she gives this
advice, “You should do
what you feel is impor-
tant.”

Keeping high standards  

To the Editor:

As open-minded as the admin-
istration and faculty of this school
may be, they seem to be pretty
adamant on one point: lowering
academic standards. Two issues
ago the topic was the Posse foun-
dation. I suppose the idea is that
students from relatively poor eco-
nomic backgrounds should have
the chance to prove their merit
in an elite setting. I am actually
in favor of this idea; however,
it seems that interim President
Beckley would have us be open
to the idea of converting merit-
based money, which currently
goes to students with outstanding
GPAs, test scores and extracur-
ricular achievements, into ﬁill

scholarships for students who ad-
mittedly don’t have the GPAs or
SAT scores that others have.

Are we really going to reward
merit that has yet to be proved
over merit that has already been
proved?

Professor Gwyn Campbell,
as the Phi reports, summed up a
particular attitude that I think the
student body should ﬁnd disturb-
ing: “We don’t need to see GPAs.
I trust Beckley, and he trusts Pos-
se.”

This statement reﬂects the
thinking that there are some ob-
jectives—such as diversity—that
are so important that they’re not
up for real debate. Unfortunately,
this attitude is echoed by some

W&L students

should strive to
show maturity

To the Editor:

Your recent staff editorial
“advising” our newly selected
university president greatly dis-
turbed me. May I point out that
the presidential search commit-
tee solicited student input on a
variety of occasions. Student
liaisons served during the selec-
tion process. The committee also
consulted with student organiza-
tions regarding their opinions of
optimal qualities for a new presi-
dent.

Furthermore, may I sug-
gest that in order for students
to receive treatment as adults,
we must ﬁrst act the part. The
whining tone of your editorial
demonstrated both inconsistency
and immaturity. If students feel
they do not enjoy stimulating
conversation with their peers,

that can be overcome only by the
students themselves. By dealing
with our own problems through
student initiative rather than tum-
ing to the administration for solu-
tions to every so-called “crisis”
we will better demonstrate our
maturity. Thereby we will gain
the conﬁdence of the university

M community and we will success-
fully transition to holding greater
responsibility over our own expe-
rience at W&L.

Let’s not burden others with
our own failings. Rather, let us
take this new beginning at W&L
as an opportimity to recommit
ourselves to actively implement-
ing our ideals of academic and
community development.

students, who undoubtedly have
the best intentions. The statement
that “anything that brings diver-
sity to W&L is important and will
help us” just shows how overea-
ger and uncritical we can become
concerning major changes in our
university. I fear this may be
the result of self-righteousness
trumping common sense.
Recently, the faculty and ad-
ministration were apparently
overeager to lower W&L’s stan-
dards—even when such ideals
as diversity were not at stake. A
nine credit reduction in the core
requirements for graduation was
approved, without debate. I sup-
pose the justiﬁcation for this
move was that our core require-

ments are already quite extensive,
and that other schools allow their
students to focus on their majors
and become more marketable.

But the fact that other schools
prefer marketability to real edu-
cation is only a reminder that
the whole country is lowering its
standards. We should not follow
suit.

Even if I am wrong, and the
school is making the right de-
cisions, I don’t like the way in
which it is making them. As a
concerned W&L student, I would
like to think that our school could
welcome open debate. Or maybe
my standards are too high.

To the Editor:

I recently read the staff ed-
itorial “Phi suggests rules for
Ruscio” and have a question
about the “Don’t be a fundrais-
er” sub-section. You write “A
big problem with presidents of
the past (ahem, Burish) is that
they only cared about money.
Rather than actually standing
for something, they did what
was popular with the people
who offered the biggest dona-
tion. We need a president who
believes in what he’s doing,
not someone who believes in
the almighty dollar.”

Phi claims need
to be explained

Can you please give spe-
ciﬁc example(s) of when a past
president--Burish or other-
wise-- “did what was popular
with people who offered the
biggest donation” when this
stood contrary to “actually
standing for something”? I ask
because I myself am unaware
of such speciﬁc examples but
would like to be educated.

Thank you, and thank you
for your coverage of our new
president.

Although not Div. I,  
sports remain strong

To the Editor:

It’s a shame that a paper
and speciﬁcally a section
(opinion) that was once so
rich in ideas and content,
with articles written by Mr.
Rule and Mr. Trout, has con-
ceded to publishing hogwash.
I am greatly disturbed by the
recent “Hot Topic” on the is-
sue of school spirit at athletic
events. Not only are the two
authors, Mr. Fahey and Ms.
Gent, wrong in their assess-
ment of Washington and Lee
athletics support, but they
make countless factual mis-
takes regarding what will
bring students out to events.

First of all, suggesting to
play Duke is by far the dumb-
est thing I have ever heard.
There are plenty of exciting
ODAC and non—conference
match—ups that even the most
inexperienced sport fans
can get excited about; for
example, recently women’s
lacrosse battled the number
3 team in the Metro region,
Franklin and Marshall. Sec-
ond, Mr. Fahey’s idea about
free giveaways at the door to
basketball games is already
in place at Washington and
Lee. For almost every bas-
ketball game this season,
upon entering one could pick
up a raffle ticket for a chance
to win great prizes such as
a $20 dollar gift certiﬁcate
to Wal-Mart (last time I
checked you could pick up
a case or two with that). It
might have been that this had
slipped Mr. Fahey’s mind as
there was no Facebook group
called, “I won a $20 gift cer-
tiﬁcate at an exciting ODAC
basketball game.” (For those
of you not familiar, ODAC
stands for the Old Dominion

stat ito

Athletic Conference. And
honestly I’m not sure if the
authors know that)

Ms. Gent’s point about
needing a guide to not only
understand the game but also
to acquire prime-time play-

ers -phone numbers seems
reasonable. However this
information is supplied in
other sources. Every Monday
at 8pm, 91.5 WLUR (which
also broadcasts a hefty per-
centage of sports games on
the web in case you can’t get
away from Facebook) there
is the Washington and Lee
Sports Report on the Monday
Night Sports beat. During
this time, all the Washington
and Lee sports action over
the past week is recapped and
a different Generals student
athlete is interviewed every
week. (Granted we haven’t
given out #29’s phone num-
ber over the air, but recently
we gave out James Madden’s
(#6) phone number and I’m
sure their are plenty of young
ladies, even my 16-year-old
sister, who would love to
have that number). And if
you really want to know why
a foul ball is foul, well the
Monday Night Sports Beat
is the only radio show to take
callers at ext.4995, so just
call in and ask.

There is really no rea-
son to not be out supporting
Washington and Lee athlet-
ics; all the resources and
tools you requested are there.
Just ‘cause you might be too
cool to paint your face for a
game doesn’t mean you can’t
come out and support your
friends, fellow students and
fraternity brothers and soror-
ity sisters. There are plenty
of students that do, so much

Alcohol policy works

Finally, students can stop
sneaking alcohol into Fancy
Dress.

If the board of trustees ap-
proves the new alcohol policy
proposals, school events such as
Fancy Dress and Mock Conven-
tion could have open bars with
alcohol available to students of
legal drinking age.

We think it’s a great idea.

Too oﬁen, campus security
simply turns a blind eye to stu-

dents swigging away on their
fancy ﬂasks.

This”<To’ntributes— to-the many
DUI and DIP ﬁnes ﬁlling the cof-
fers of the Lexington treasury.

Not that campus security is
responsible for underage kids de-
ciding to drink and act stupid.

But the new policy could help
the school encourage responsibil-
ity.

If the students who are 21 do
not have a reason to sneak straight

so that in the fall when I was
broadcasting the Volleyball
ODAC Championships at
Emery and Henry College
(three hours south on I-81)
that a group of four or ﬁve
students made the trip not

only to support the volley-
ball team but also the foot-
ball team who was in action
against the Wasps.

But just in case you have
not been able to pull your-
self away from stalking high ~
school freshmen and cre-
ating your social ‘timeline
on facebook, here is what
has happened this year that
should get you excited about
attending and supporting
General’s Athletics:

Fall:

The football team posted
a 7-3 record, claiming their
first seven win season since
1985. They had two players
named to the Don Hansen
Football Gazette Division III
Football All-America team
(Sitterson and Martin) and
six named to the Roanoke
Times College Division All-
State team. Field Hockey
won their first ever ODAC
Championship, posting a re-
cord of 15-6 and having four
Generals Named to ‘Ail-State
Field Hockey Team. Volley-
ball won their ﬁfth consecu-
tive ODAC championship
led by two-time ODAC play-
er of the year Christine Gla-
dysz. Men’s Soccer posted a
record 9-6-2 and had senior
defender Derrick Lott has
named to the National Soc-
cer Coaches Association of
America (NSCAA) Division
III All-South Region team.
Women ‘s Soccer qualiﬁed
for the NCAA tournament
and placed four Generals

liquor into a function and then
drink it straight, then they won’t
do it.

Many other universities al-
ready have this attitude about
student consumption. Emory,
for example, uses school swipe
cards to ID students for drinking
at events. ‘I

W&L cannot and should not
condone underage drinking, but
it makes sense to let twenty-one-
year-olds obtain alcohol in a sen-
sible manner.

It’s about time that the school
took a more progressive stance on
student drinking.

on the all state soccer team.
Both the men’s and women’s
Cross Country team won the
0DAC’s.

Winter:

Men’s basketball had a re-
building season but ﬁnished
with an impressive 91-68
win over Eastern Mennonite.
Women’s basketball played
their way into the confer-
ence tournament and gave-
thc number one seed (the #9
team in the nation) Randolph
Macon their biggest scare
by far. Men’s swimming
won the Bluegrass Mountain
Conference Championship
and sent seven swimmers to
the NCAA‘s. While Women’s
Swimming captured their
thirteenth straight ODAC
title. Wrestling struggled in
the conference tournament
but is program that is con-
tinuing to grow and get bet-
ter.

Spring: ,

Already this spring the
Men’s lacrosse team has
defeated No. 15 Ithaca.
Women’s lacrosse is ranked
number three in the South
Atlantic region. And Base-
ball is off to a solid start
with Senior Scott Gosselink
breaking school records and
Senior Dave Mackenzie add-
ing to his career record for
most times being hit-by-a-
pitch.

The fact is our teams
are good. So get 01? your
computer and stop making
excuses why you don’t go
to games. And if you really
can’t get off the computer at
least listen to them on 91.5
FM.

Andy McEnroe
Class of 2008

In the past, the school has had
the tendency to overlook student
drinking, either pretending it’s
not happening, or pretending it’s
not an issue.

This new policy, if approved,
shows that W&L is ﬁnally look-
ing at controlling alcohol use at
these formal events.

Student drinking cannot be
stopped, and frankly, it may not
be the school’s place to try.

Loopholes can always be
found in any policy, but the Phi
applauds the university for trying
to close one of them.

THE RING-TUM PHI - 5

 

.
BA RS

Here is the latest update on who ran afoul
of the law during the last few weeks. We

took a peek at this weeks police reports

to see what you ’ve been up to...

 

Don't drink and carry
Lexington resident David
Huffman was arrested on
Tues., March 7 and charged
with being drunk in public

Vista was arrested on March
9 on charges of driving under
the inﬂuence. Along with the
DUI, he was cited for speed-
ing; he is accused of going 57
mph in a 45 mph area. Fur-
thermore, Montgomery was
charged driving on an already
suspended license.

Making a bad
evening worse

On Thursday, March 9 Larry
Freeman was arrested and
charged with a DUI. Of-
ﬁcer Riley of the Lexington
Police Department made the
arrest at 10:30 p.m. Three
hours later, at 1:30 a.m., the
forty-year-old Freeman was

charged with malicious as-

sault.
No underage imbibing

Katherine Lacey of Lexington
and Lara Koogler of Raphine,
Va. were arrested and charged

were made at 1:41 a.m. The
two 18-year-olds were also
cited for underage possession
of alcohol.

Assault and battery
Angie Davis was charged
with assault and battery on
Mon., March 13. Though
the charges were originally

ﬁcer Fitzgerald of the Lex-
ington force delivered the
citation to Davis.

Try not to break thlngs
18-year-old William Ware of
Lexington was charged with

tion of property less than one

thousand dollars in value.

  Newalcohol review

University committee considers changes to school is substance abuse policy. A

By Jessica Shaw V
$‘tfE*'fF ww_'E‘R" as  .

   

 As rowdy, ‘intoxicated.

. students lined up for the pa-
rade to kick off Mock Con-
vention in 2004. a number of
male students decided to re-
lieve themselves on the wall
of a Rockbridge Elementary
School, exposing themselves
to young children. Situations
like these have warranted
a call for intervention with
regard to alcohol by the uni-
versity.

In 2001, the administra-
tion along with members of
the SIG comprised a concise
pamphlet, available online,
entitled “Substance Abuse
Policy”. Four years later,
students and faculty have
collaborated once again to
make slight alterations to this
somewhat vague document.

“We pulled together a
campus~wide task force,” EC
President and senior Charlie
Yates said. “What we came
up with was an outline for
further initiatives.”

This documented proposal is
awaiting approval from‘ faculty
andthe Board of Trustees with a
presentation scheduled in April.
If it passes, the new policy will
be implemented next Fall.

According to Dean of Stu-
dents Dawn Watkins, one of the
main goals of the proposal is to
relieve the SJC of small cases
leaving them open to spend more
time on cases where an immedi-
ate decision is not clear. She said
that at this point, too much time
is spent overseeing obvious vio-
lations such as drinking in the
freshmen dorms.

Yates said another major goal
of the promoters is to focus on
reducing high risk actions. He
said the school seems to be con-
demning any use of alcohol. He
also said they want to make a
distinction between those two
things as well as hone in on high
risk behavior.

Another main concern of the
proposal is redeﬁning and clari-
fying the “safe haven” use of the
campus Health Center.

University Physician Jane
Horton said she hopes students

will not avoid help when in need
of medical attention. She wants
‘the  to clarify thatthere '

' will be no repercussions for

seeking help at the inﬁrmary.

Some of the proposed ini-
tiatives include an expanded
safe ride program, elimination

«of alcohol from undergraduate
classroom buildings and broad-
ened campus activities without
alcohol.

“We saw a growing need for
clarity,” said chair of judicial
sub-committee professor Janet
Ikeda. “We can reﬁne some of
the many points and make it a
more eﬂicient process as well.”

The policy also calls for a
shift to individuals being held
responsible for violations as op-
posed to an entire group. The
proposal also clariﬁes the strike
system.‘

“Last year, students, faculty
and staff got together to see how
to put this together,” Yates said.
“The broad consensus was that
the structure we have is what we
ought to do.”

One important addition the
policy recommends a permanent

adviser with legal training for

the SJC. In the) consufuction

of this document, the group
brought in a consultant to ad-
vise them. ,

“[We hired] an outside
consultant [to discuss} trends
in higher education in terms
of the role of the university,”
Horton said. I

Watkins and Horton men-
tioned that the school may
attempt to bring alcohol back
to events such as Fancy Dress
and Mock Convention if dis-
tributed through a reliable
vendor and used responsibly.
However, they said they are
fairly certain events like the
tailgates will remain banned.

The main issue at hand is
the presentation and potential
approval of these proposed
initiatives. The chairs of this
operation are seeking student
feedback and support.

“We are relying on stu-
dent leadership to make this
work,” Horton said. “We
want student feedback and in-
put. Get in touch with student
chairs in sub-committees.”

Gospel Fest a success

Despite weather students put together
their successful annual show

By Katherine Greene
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF

LEXINGTON—Theydanced,
they clapped, they sang.

When 39 students wearing
brightly—colored shirts shook
the rafters of R.E. Lee Episcopal
Church on Saturday, it was the
climax of a year’s worth of hard
work.

Joyful Noise, Washington and
Lee’s student—run gospel choir,
held their annual Gospel Fest
Saturday afternoon.

Though it practiced until 2
a.m., the group was enthusiastic
about the performance.

“They were shaking that Laf-
fy Taffy for Jesus Christ,” said
Mistress of Ceremonies Yvonne
Coker.

The performance included
several songs with the entire

group singing and dancing in
unison, as well as a ballet perfor-
mance.

Ashlee Metcalf, treasurer for
Joyful Noise, as well as a danc-
er, said that the dance ministry
worked late into the night on
their six-minute routine.

The group works hard for this
performance, she said. “This is
our big thing we do every year.”

Dean Tammy Futrell, who
advises the choir, said she likes
“watching the satisfaction” of the
students in the group while they
perform.

“I like seeing the look on their
faces when they know they’ve
done a good job,” she said.

Futrell said she was proud of
the students, who put everything
together themselves.

“I just hand over the credit
card,” she said.

The students plan the pro-
gram, invite the guests, organize
the food, coordinate the outﬁts,
and choose the speakers with
minimal help from Futrell.

Metcalf said that the group
started initial planning last year.
They usually plan for 150 attend-
ees, so they have to ﬁgure out
how to seat and feed them all in
their $3000 budget, she said.

The group gets some funding
from the Multicultural Students
Association, but it is not always
enough, Metcalf said.

“What we don’t have, we try
to raise,” she said, pointing out
that the group sold T-shirts on
Parents’ Weekend as a fundraiser.

Among the guests at Gospel
Fest this year was a Virginia Tech
gospel choir, who performed
twice.

Several other choirs were
scheduled to attend, but canceled
due to the bad weather Saturday
morning.

Not everyone was put off by

the weather. Lexington resident
Rosa Harris said she tries to at-
tend Gospel Fest every year.

“I just love the students and
their exuberance and enthusi-
asm,” she said.

Harris, a singer herself, said
she really enjoys hearing the stu-
dents put on a good show. She
said that she heard about Gospel
Fest through her church, where
Joyful Noise performs once a
month.

“They support our church, and
I support them,” she said.

Some said they had other rea-
sons for attending. Sophomore
Jack Jeong said he came to sup-
port his friends in the choir.

He added that the convenient
location was a plus.

“It’s not tough taking time out
of a good Saturday before ﬁnals
and walking a whole block,” he
said. ‘

Harris agreed. She said, “I
could have stayed another two
hours.”

Martyr
remembered

VM graduate Jonathan Daniels is
honored by R.E. Lee Episcopal Church
in a special Sunday evening service

By Stacey Grljalva
REPORTER

Jonathan Daniels, Valedicto-
rian of Virginia Military Institute,
saved a 16-year-old girl when
he pushed her out of the way of
a shotgun blast in 1965. He died
instantly.

On Sunday the girl he saved,
Ruby Sales, spoke at R.E. Lee
Episcopal Church, where Daniels
was a part of the young group.
Sales is now an Episcopal minis-
ter and, in fact, attended the same
seminary school as Daniels.

For saving Sales, Daniels was
named a martyr by the Episco-
pal Church and has his own feast
day.

“It’s like being a saint,” said
Nick Gorham, youth minister
at R.E. Lee. “He’s one of three
American martyrs ever. He made
an amazing sacriﬁce.” ,

Daniels, a priest—in-training,
was only 26 when he was killed
in 1965.

On August 14, the date of his
feast day, Daniels was arrested
during a demonstration. He had
just been released from jail when
he went to a local store with Sales
and another black girl. The group
was met on the porch of the store
by a man holding a shotgun who
refused to allow the group to enter
the store. When the man pointed
the gun at the teenaged Sales,
Daniels pushed the girl out of the
way and took the shot himself.

R.E. Lee celebrated Daniels’
life with a special service on
Sunday night, attended by Sales
and the Episcopalian bishop for
southwestern Virginia.

In conjunction with the ser-
vice, VMI awarded its Jonathan
Daniels Humanitarian award to
Ambassador Andrew Young on
Thursday.

Young was an ambassador to
the United Nations and worked
alongside Martin Luther King, Jr.

Although saddened by Dan-
iels’ death, King praised his sac-
riﬁce.

“One of the most heroic Chris-
tian deeds of which I have heard in

my entire ministry was performed
by Jonathan Daniels,” King has
said. “Certainly there are no inci-
dents more beautiful in the annals
of church history, and though we
are grieved at this time, our grief
should give way to a sense of
Christian honor and nobility.”

Daniels had been in Alabama
to register black voters and to try
to integrate the Episcopal Church
only a year after the Civil Rights
Act.

“[At that time], the South was
in a state of apartheid embedded
in law,” said journalism Professor
Doug Cumming. “It hid its brutal-
ity until confronted.”

Daniels had originally come to
Alabama when he joined King in
the march from Selma to Mont-
gomery.

After missing the bus back to

divinity school, he decided to stay ’

and work for equality. His school
allowed him to stay; he only
needed to return to the North to
take his ﬁnal exams.

“He perceived his work for
social justice as a mission, as the
Church’s mission,” said sopho-
more Dane Boston.

Daniels was arrested and killed
in “bloody” Lowndes County,
where the population was a ma-
jority black but dominated by a
white minority. . .

“[Bloody Lowndes] was
known for the violence used by
whites to maintain their control,”
says Charles W. Eagles in a book
he wrote about Daniels.

Only ﬁve months before in
Lowndes, a white woman had
been shot twice in the head when
driving home participants of the
Selma-to-Montgomery march.

Despite the danger, Daniels
stayed in the area.

“He was struck with what he
had to do,” Boston said. “He was
very much a proponent of justice
and individual rights.”

His death affected the civil
rights movement, the Episcopal
Church, and VMI.

“Jon Daniels was a ﬁnal touch-
ing demonstration of courage and
sacriﬁce,” said Cumming.

Water violation is
Lexington’s first

the plant treatments of the water i
and hopes to restore the balance
of enough chlorine to kill the bac-
teria but not enough to violate
safety standards.

The violation is the ﬁrst of its
kind for the city. In the past, Lex-
ington has tested the water supply
every quarter and has never had
a violation. Because of the clean
record, the Virginia Department
of Health allowed Lexington to
move to an annual testing. The
ﬁrst of these armual tests was
conducted in August of 2005,
which is when the violation was
found, and the Health Department
recommended that the city move
back to quarterly.

According to the American
Joumal of Epidemiology, levels
of HAA5 tend to spike during the
summer, particularly in August.

Woody acknowledged that the
time lapse between the sample
and the notiﬁcation of violation
was signiﬁcant. “Usually we get
the results in one to two months.
In this case, I don’t know why it
took so long,” he said.

Decreasing the levels of chlo-
rine in water treatment will not
expose city residents to dangerous
bacteria, however. Other bacteria
tests are in place to monitor those
levels, Woody said.

According to a report by the
University of Minnesota’s Envi-
ronmental Health Sciences School
of Public Health, a high dose of
HAA5 in drinking water over the
long term led to liver tumors, and
in the short term, was found to be
a neurotoxin.

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity is also affected, since it gets
its water from the Maury Service
Authority.

“You are our customers,”
Woody said.

W&L Dean of Students Dawn
Watkins heard about the problem
on March 23, ﬁve days after the
letter was sent out. Since on-cam-
pus students are equally as affect-
ed as those living off-campus, but
did not receive a letter from the
city, Watkins said that the school
sent out an immediate notice
which ran in Campus Notices on
March 24.

Regarding the delay in notiﬁ-
cation, Watkins said, “I guess it
makes some sense in, as I learned
from Facilities Management and
Dr. Horton [W&L’s nurse] when
I looked into this, there’s nothing
“emergency” about it, so perhaps
that explains the delay ﬁom the
city’s perspective.”

Woody said that correcting the
problem shouldn’t affect the wa-
ter rates for the city, despite the
cost of additional testing.

Challenges

await new
president

contlnued from Page 1

and citizens for the kind of
world they’ll encounter in the
twenty-ﬁrst century, he said.”

Lewis John, who served as
Dean of Students from 1969-
1990 and now teaches politics in
the Williams School, has twice

hired Ruscio ~ once right after his .

graduation to work in the Dean of
Students’ office and once to be-
come dean of freshmen. He said
Ruscio’s status as an alumnus will
help him as a president.

John pointed out that the
school has not had an alumnus
serve as president since 1968-
1983 when Robert Huntley ﬁlled
the office.

John said that being an alum-
nus is “key in understanding tra-
ditions and values.”

However, alumnus status was
not a priority to everyone.

Law professor Brian Murchi-
son, who headed the presidential
search committee, said, “It was
less important that he was an
alumnus than that he’d had ex-
perience with a small liberal arts
school. He’d had experience with
our type of education.”

Coming into the search,
some staff members said that the
school’s sense of community has
been strained recently. Lyn Ham-
mett, an administrative assistant
and member of the search com-
mittee, said some of the problems
stretch back to John Elrod’s ten-
ure as president.

“The staff wants someone fa-
miliar with the things that were
going on here during the past
administrations,” Hammett said.
She cited payroll complaints as a
continual problem.

John Gunn, an emeritus pro-
fessor in the Economics Depart-
ment, said he thinks Ruscio is
the right person to deal with the
university’s problems.

“He’s an extraordinarily ﬁne
person with a gentle disposition,”
Gunn said. “He’s a consensus
builder. He’s very well infonned
with what has been going on here.
He knows there are problems
and is anxious to get to work on
them.”

Gunn also said that faculty and
staff reaction to the Ruscio hiring
had been uniformly favorable.

“The lower paid staffers are
very loyal to the institution,”
Gunn said. “They cared about the
process and are enthusiastic about
the choice.

Hammett said Ruscio’s hiring
will help solve some of the cam-
pus’s problems.

“Ruscio’s going to help, but it
will take a while for him to ﬁnd
out what’s going on here. He’ll
go visit with students and staff,
maybe just in informal sessions,”

she said.

‘‘I’m a liberal arts guy ﬁrst
and foremost,” Ruscio said.

Psychology professor David
Elmes said he did not see Rus-
cio being a C-School president.

“Ruscio’s a thoughtful per-
son,” Elmes said, “and he would
blanch at the thought of favorit-
ism.”

Politics professor William
Connelly said Ruscio wouldn’t
bring any extra inﬂuence to the
Commerce School. A

“He bleeds blue and white;
even as a politics professor he
had built bridges to science and
the College. He understands
the differences within the uni-
versity.”

Dean Larry Peppers also
pointed out Ruscio’s experience
with interdisciplinary programs
as an important factor.

John said he thinks Ruscio’s
time in that area will serve him
well.

“The variety of experiences 0

he has had at Washington and
Lee as a student, faculty mem-
ber, administrator in both stu-
dent life and academics make
him able to work with students,
particularly freshmen in that
difﬁcult year of transition when
they’re away from home,” John
said.

As a student Ruscio was a
member of the Pi Kappa Phi
fraternity, but he said he was
a social member at Sigma Chi
during his last two years. Gunn
said Ruscio spent most of his
time at Sigma Chi because two
of his closest friends, Bob Bal-
lenger and Michael Luttig, were
members there.

Ballenger now teaches busi-
ness administration at W&L,
and Luttig is a judge on the
Fourth Circuit of the United
States Court of Appeals.

Ruscio quoted former uni-
versity president John Wilson
when talking about his vision
for the Greek system.

“John Wilson said if Wash-
ington and Lee would maintain
the Greek system it would need
the best Greek system in the
country,” Ruscio said. “At its
best the system stands for ideals
and values.”

As Ruscio settles into the Lee
House and the president’s office
next year, students can expect
to see him around campus on a
regular basis.

He says one of his favorite
things is W&L athletics, and he
promised to attend every game
he possibly could. He also said
he would attend a large number
of events for the arts.

“This is my home,” Ruscio-

said, “I’m coming back home
to where I’m most comfortable.
You’ll see a lot of me.”

No rest for the weary

Women s lacrosse brings in tough non-conference teams to increase intensity

By Elllottwalker
STAFF WRITER

The women’s lacrosse team
didn’t face any ODAC competi-
tors last week, but they still man-
aged to play three games.

The team took on Williams,
Colorado College and Catholic
University last week. Although
none of the teams are in their con-
ference, they faced some tough
competition. Williams occupies
the 12 spot in the national rank-
ings while Colorado College is
ranked fourth.

“It’s a different type of aggres-
sion than some of the teams in the
ODAC,” said Megan Slosson, a
sophomore on the team. “It helps
you become more versatile and
well—rounded as a team by play-
ing them.”

The team started the week by
playing Williams last Tuesday.
The team narrowly lost by a score
of 10-9, but showed determina-
tion until the end.

“It was a good game,” said
Kendall Korte, the team statisti-
cian. “There was a little bit of
a lull in the end of the ﬁrst half

but other than that it was a great
game...they really came through
in the end.”

The Generals were down 7-
2 at the end of the ﬁrst half, but
rallied to come within one point
by the end of the game, notching
their last goal with only 12 sec-
onds remaining.

“Even though we lost, what’s
so great about our team is that
we can criticize the way we per-
formed so we can learn from our
mistakes,” said Kat Michaels, a
sophomore defenseman. “The
game just ﬁred me up for the next
game.”

Colorado College arrived in
Lexington with an unblemished
record of 5-0. The team has made
appearances in the NCAA touma—
ment for the past four years, with
a Final Four appearance in the
tournament last year. Colorado
was added to the Generals’ sched-
ule this year. The Generals didn’t
know much about the team going
into the game, says senior captain
Rachel Wallick.

Colorado played Williams on
Thursday, and the Generals took
full advantage of going to see
them play.

“You get a better feel for how
[a team] plays by seeing them in
person,” said Christine Bender.
“You can see what kind of plays
they run and especially for our
defense, they can see who the key
attackers are.”

Going into the game against
Colorado on Friday, the General ’s
strategy was “to come out strong
and play 60 minutes with high in-
tensity,” said Wallick.

The women won 15-7.

Without having much rest all
week, the team took on Catholic

on Sunday. Catholic’s record was
not as good as Colorado’s coming
into the game; they have posted
four wins and two losses this sea-
son. Catholic is known for their
aggressive style, says Slosson.

“Catholic is always a competi-
tive game...they are athletic and
love to compete,” said Wallick.

The women won it 21-6.

The Generals will take a break
from games until exams are over,
but will resume their season on
April 8 with an ODAC game
against Sweet Briar.

Weston said that she con-
tinues to play well despite an
injury.

Day is an aggressive
baseliner, and is also a great
supporter of the entire team.

Weston said, “When
she’s done with her match,
she busts out cheers from
her high school cheerleading
days.”

The team is led by two
senior captains, Lisa Mabry
and Patty Roberts. Mabry is
coming back from time off
to complete her senior thesis.
Known for her footwork and
consistent ground strokes,
Mabry is a doubles special-
ist. Weston said, Mabry has
“ground strokes with spin
that she’ll never miss.”

Weston described Roberts
as “an amazing leader and a
great captain, not to men-
tion a great tennis player.
She is always supporting the
team and giving 100% in her
matches as well.” Roberts
also has the game to back up
her leadership skills.

Will described Roberts

as a good leader who has been an
integral role in the team’s success
this year. She was the only cap-
tain on the team while Mabry was
ﬁnishing her thesis.

This past week, the Fab Five
tournament came to W&L, bring-
ing some of the best Division III
players to Lexington.

The Fab Five tournament be-
gan in 2001. The idea was to have
the top ﬁve teams in the nation
play each other. Over time, the
number of teams involved has
grown, with 11 teams here in Lex-
ington for the tournament. The
tournament began last Thursday
and will continue until Thursday.

  

Fab Five Tournament challenges record

Of the l 1 that are participating,
six are ranked in the top seven
nationally and the other ﬁve are
ranked between 16 and 30.

Coach Cinda Rankin described
this year’s ﬁeld, saying, “The Fab
Five is the strongest Division III
tennis tournament in the nation.”

Timmis said, “Last year at
the Fab Five in California we
had good matches with Gustavus
Adolphus and Trinity, both teams
we will face again this year. “

As Rankin said, “It is a terriﬁc
opportunity for our team and we
are really excited to have such
good competition.”

Rankin said that the keys to
success in the Fab Five would be
“endurance, mental toughness,
and perseverance. W&L will have
to step up. We will be playing six
matches in seven days. We will
be playing the best of the best in
every match.”

Timmis said, “The great thing
about this tournament is that ev-
ery match should be incredible.
It’s a great honor to host this high-
caliber tournament. The matches
should be fun to watch and really
good competition.”

Applegate said, “It will be im-

portant for us to do well be-
cause it impacts our rankings
going into nationals in May.”

When asked about the
weather, Will said, “It’s going
to be cold. However, I don’t
think it will affect it much.”
She said that the team would
be used to the elements, un-
like past years when it has
warmed up earlier.

The Generals opened the
Fab Five with a win over third
ranked Amherst, winning 7-2.

Tabb said, “The win was
really exciting because it was
our ﬁrst real test this year. We
lost a great player last year,
but I think we showed that
we could still play conﬁdently
and make an impact.”

On Friday, W&L beat
ninth ranked Middlebury, 7-
2. The Generals then went on
to beat twenth-seventh ranked
Tufts 8-1 on Saturday.

The Generals still have
a match against sixteenth-
ranked Williams on Tuesday
at 4 p.m., ﬁnishing up the
tournament against ﬁfth-
ranked Gustavus Adolphus on
Wednesday at 4 p.m..

Tough losses
disheartening
after strong
start to season

Men is tennis falls to II -7, 8-0 ODA C,
following devastating losses to
Swarthmore and Washington College

ByM|keFahey
STAFF warren

The Washington and Lee
men’s tennis team was ﬁnally hit-
ting its stride, with two of their
star players back from injuries in
top form, all while being ranked
eleventh nationally.

The team faced a tough chal-
lenge last weekend against
Swarthmore and Washington Col-
lege, the former being nationally-
ranked.

Sophomore Tim Ross echoed
the importance of the weekend.
He said, “This weekend will be
huge for us. Both teams are in our
region, and if we want to get to
NCAA Regionals this year, we’ll
need to have a good showing this
weekend.”

The Generals were also with-
out singles star Jon Malooly who
recently injured his knee during
an IM basketball game.

Going into this big weekend,
Coach David Detwiler said, “I
would feel a lot better if I had Jon
Malooly. I feel like most of the
teams might be a little bit down
just like we are. I feel like it will
be a very competitive match.”

Detwiler said, “The weekend
is a big tell-tale sign. If we win
both matches this weekend, we
are looking pretty good. If we
struggle a little bit, it’s going to
hurt us. The best tennis we’ve
played so far was against Came-
gie Melon. We’re looking to play
at that level again.”

W&L narrowly lost both
matches by one court as Swarth-
more and Washington College
each won four while W&L won
only three.

The Generals now have a re-
cord of 11-7 and are a perfect 8-0
in ODAC play. The team plays a
tough schedule of nationally-
ranked opponents, which account
for six of their seven osses.

As senior Jordan Eichenberger
said, “So far this season we’ve
beaten the teams that we’re sup-
posed to beat and we’ve lost to
the teams that we’re supposed
to lose to, with the exception of
Denison who we’re deﬁnitely bet-
ter than.”

The Denison match was a re-
ally tough loss for the Generals as
three of their top players, Maloo-
ly, Anderson and Seth F eibelman,
were out with injuries and David
Shay, their number one singles
player, was out of town at his
grandparent’s ﬁftieth wedding an-
niversary.

Eichenberger said, “I think

everyone on the team would tell
you that we’ve yet to play to our
full potential as a team and we’re
looking to do that this weekend.”

As Detwiler said, “I would say
Tim Ross has really stepped up.
He’s working harder than anyone
on the team, as far as he practices
and he also has spent a lot of time
on his own time working on the
ball machine and his serve.”

Detwiler had nothing but
praise for his captains, saying,
“David Shay is playing his best
tennis since his sophomore year.
I hope to go to the NCAA’s with
him individually. Charles Ander-
son is a great captain. He is very
intense competitor.”

The Generals have had easy
7-0 wins against four ODAC op-
ponents over the past two weeks,
showing complete control of their
conference.

As Eichenberger said, “We
continued our dominance of
ODAC opponents this past week
against Roanoke and the other
teams and I think those matches
will provide a good tune up for
Swarthmore and Washington Col-
lege.”

For the season as a whole, De-
twiler said, “I would say we’ve
played pretty well. It’s been dif-
ﬁcult. We’ve had a tremendous
amount of injuries.”

However, with the injuries be-
ginning to heal, the team is look-
ing strong as it continues down
the stretch.

Detwiler had a good outlook
on the injury situation, saying,
“We have the joke with the train-
ing room that a lot of the athletes
get hurt on Friday and Saturday
night.”

As Ross said, “For the past
week everyone on the team has
played solid tennis and we’ve
come out with our perfect record
in the ODAC intact.”

Eichenberger added, “In the
beginning of the season we were
a little shaky against our ODAC

-opponents but as we’ve shown in

the past week we’re still dominant
in the ODAC. We expect to keep
improving as the season goes on
and win the ODAC tournament
and do well in the national tour-
nament.”

While the team had an un-
fortunate weekend, they are still
looking to the future. .

As Ross pointed out, “We
have Mary Washington which is
always a huge rivalry match for
us after ﬁnals, but after that it’s
just preparation until NCAA’s in
early May.”

many of the goals that we
set for ourselves at the be-

the team to keep improving
through the outdoor sea-

After graduating only a
few seniors last year, Revoir

is signiﬁcant improvement.
Our goal for the outdoor

ing as an ODAC power.”

 In defense of Calhoun

University of Connecticut coach 3* ways questioned by media

When UConn advanced deep into March Mad-

ness, the team drew the attention of many

national media outlets. As a result of his suc-

cesses, Coach Jim Calhoun’s practices have

come under ﬁre in the past few years, despite

his denying any wrongdoing.

ByThomasG|ft
sun warren

In his twenty seasons at Con-
necticut, coach Jim Calhoun has
built one of college basketball’s
preeminent powerhouses. With
two national championships,
more than 700 wins, and an in-
duction into the Basketball Hall
of Fame under his belt, Calhoun
is arguably the most successful
active coach in the sport. His in-
tense on-the-court ﬂair, coupled
with his proven track-record of
winning, has earned Calhoun
the respect of countless coaches,
players, and fans.

This year, UConn is once
again a consensus favorite to win
the NCAA championship. Al-
though virtually no one questions
Calhoun’s ability to bring home
another national title, X’s and O’s
may not have been the only thing

on Calhoun’s mind as he headsed-
into the Sweet Sixteen this week-
end. Recently, there has been a
slew of accusations surrounding
Calhoun for perpetuating what
has been dubbed a culture of ethi-
cally challenged behavior in the
UConn basketball program.

In his online column, Gregg
Doyel of CBS SportsLine de-
nounced Calhoun’s “cutthroat
negative recruiting tactics” and
“exploitation of NCAA loop-
holes.” Writing in an opinion
piece, Jeff Jacobs of the Hartford
Courant called Calhoun a “bully”
and sarcastically remarked, “Win-
ning apparently entitles the man
[Calhoun] to treat others badly.”

Most of these attacks center on
two charges: ﬁrst, that Calhoun
allowed star point-guard Marcus
Williams to play this season after
being convicted of stealing lap-
top computers, but back-up guard

A]. Price was suspended for the
entire duration for involvement in
the same crime; second, that Cal-
houn somehow stole coveted high
school player Doug Wiggins from
St. John’s through unfair recruit-
ing tactics.

It is time to set the record
straight and to restore the up-
standing reputation of Calhoun.
These allegations against him are
not only false, but they are also
dishonest.

Doyel and Jacobs have long
harbored personal vendettas
against Calhoun because he has
refused to speak with them at
press conferences. Unfortunately,
these “joumalists” have decided
to use their personal dislike of
Calhoun as a rationale for em-
barking on unwarranted character
assassination of him. The
proof of this claim lies in the fact
that their accusations simply do
not hold evidential weight.

First, the charge that Calhoun
gave Williams preferential treat-
ment because of his star status is
easily refutable. Williams imme-
diately admitted his guilt after be-
ing confronted with stealing lap-
tops. In contrast, Price repeatedly
denied involvement in the crime
until evidence pointed to his im-
pending guilt. Different crime,
different penalty. End of story.

Second,thechargethatCalhoun
stole Doug Wiggins away from St.

John’s is unsubstantiated. When
Wiggins initially called UConn,
Calhoun and his assistant coaches
refused to talk with him because
he had already committed to St.
John’s. It was only after Wig-
gins broke his non-binding verbal
commitment that UConn started
recruiting him again. The recruit-
ing practices employed by Cal-
houn fell well within both ethical
parameters and official NCAA
regulations. Wiggins is a mature
adult who voluntarily made the
decision to attend UConn. No
one forced him to do anything
or go anywhere. Again, end of
story.

I have written to both Doyel
and Jacobs to express my con-
tempt for their libel against Cal-
houn.

Doyel did not respond.

Jacobs replied with an e-mail
in which he abruptly told me, ‘‘I
spread truths, not mistruths.”

To be sure, the facts indicate
otherwise. Calhoun may not be
the most affable; likeable, or even
righteous guy in college basket-
ball, but Doyel and Jacobs’ sanc-
timony is on a completely differ-
ent level. ' " *

And therefore, perhaps it is
Gregg Doyel and Jeff Jacobs, not
Jim Calhoun, who should be im-
pugned for “ethically challenged
behavior”.

season ranking

-ity at one point this season,
but he has pitched well recently
and has brought his ERA down
to 5.29.

These guys, along with soph-
omores Myke Mulhem and Jeff
Pharis, will have to stabilize the
bullpen and soon if this team is
to make a deep run in the touma-
ment.

Many players have expressed
their disappointment in the team ’s
overall quality of defensive play.

“We haven’t had a perfect
defensive performance yet,” said
Wesley.

Shortstop Ray Sweeney, for
instance, has made a handful of
phenomenal plays, but also leads
the team with 11 errors.

He hits a paltry .194 at the
plate, so excellent defensive per-
formance is imperative.

Fortunately Coach Stickley
has shown a great deal of conﬁ-
dence in Sweeney.

He has started all 19 games
thus far.

Certainly inconsistency has
not been the only culprit, as the
team has made errors all around
the inﬁeld and outﬁeld.

“Our defense has to be av-
eraging 4-5 errors a game, and

those are just the ones that are

ruled errors. There are countless

other plays we haven’t made that

we should have,” said Garland.
“If our defense doesn’t im-

prove, we won’t be going very
far in the toumament,” he said.

Despite the pitching and de-
fensive woes, the Generals are
talented enough to have won 14
of 22 games.

Along with improving their
defense and ﬁnding reliable clos-
ers, Parker says keeping catcher
Jordan Wesley healthy is vital.

“He is one of the more inte-
gral parts of this team, and we
need him to stay healthy in order
to succeed.”

Wesley himself remains con-
ﬁdent. He said, “As long we keep
playing with the intensity and
conﬁdence we’ve been playing
with lately, we’ll make a legiti-
mate run at winning the ODAC.”

“So far I think we’re hav-
ing a good year, especially in
the conference,” said Sweeney.
“But I think everyone would say
that we’ve lost some games we
should have won.”

He points to two games
against Virginia Wesleyan and
Bridgewater when the team blew
late-inning leads.

But he said he is optimistic
about the season.

“I think on the whole we’re
one of the better teams in the
ODAC.”

Players also agree that fan
support is greatly appreciated.

As Wesley says, “It’s a lot
more fun playing in front of
heckling fans.”

Pushing of strong

Women ﬁnish ﬁrst, men secure second in season-opening W&L Invitational

ByMIkeFahey
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee Track
and Field team has had an impres-
sive start to their spring outdoor
season. _

Coming off their best ﬁnish
ever at the ODAC indoor track
championships, the women cap-
tured the W&L invitational and
placed well at the Roanoke Invi-
tational.

Huntley Rodes said, “At in-
door ODACs, we had our best
team performance ever and we
are looking to take that even fur-
ther at outdoor ODACs. We have
met and surpassed the goals that
we set for ourselves as a team at
the beginning of the season.”

At the Roanoke Invitational,
the Generals set records and
scored points, capturing ten Top-
ﬁve ﬁnishes, while one freshmen
set two school records in the pro-
cess.

Freshmen sensation Stacy
Doombos set a school record in
the triple jump, recording a leap
of 34’6”, winning the event for
the Generals. She is also a threat
on the track. Doombos went on
to place third in the 100-meters,
running a blistering 12.84 sec-
onds and setting another school
record.

Doombos has dominated all
of her races, holding three school
records in the outdoor season.
As teammate Alysen Kuck said,

“The team is doing well, espe-

cially with Stacy since she is like
super-woman and does just about
every event.”

It was the freshmen’s day to
shine at the Roanoke meet as
freshman Stephanie Stelter cap-
tured a first place ﬁnish in the
400-meter hurdles and was fourth
in the 100-meter hurdles.

Doombos and Stelter also
combined with freshman Tara
Hildenbrand and sophomore Di-
ana Dozier to capture a second
place ﬁnish in the 4x400-meter
relay.

Kuck, a freshman, was a force
in the ﬁeld events, placing third in
the high jump and ﬁnishing fourth
in the javelin. Rodes placed fourth
in the triple jump.

Junlor Huntley Rodes’ triple jump at the W&L Invitational, which the women won overall.

As the season begins to hit its
stride with this past weekend’s
meet at Wake Forest, Doombos
said, “This season is looking re-
ally good. We are training hard
and getting into the short outdoor
season.”

On the men’s side of the track,
the Generals have been dominat-
ing their opponents from the start
of the season, placing second at
the W&L Invitational. At the R0-'

anoke Invitational, the Generals
had some great results, running
against many of their top rivals.
The Roanoke meet featured a
lessened squad, speciﬁcally. with
the distance runners, as coaches
Nate and Kris Hoey have allowed
each member of the team to take a
“training weekend” and work out
on campus as opposed to compet-
ing. .
At Roanoke, junior Ryan Edge

ﬁnished second in the high jump,
and sophomore Wilson Robin-
son and freshman Chip McCoy
placed third and sixth in the 400
meter hurdles, respectively.

very well and achieved many of

Despite setbacks,
baseball excels

Team remains optimistic about season

By Tom Bush and
Katherine Greene
STAFF WRITER AND
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF

At the season’s halfway mark,
the Generals have posted a re-
spectable 14-7 record. Particu-
larly impressive are their seven
wins in ten conference games.
While some pre-season predic-
tions of 30 wins (which would be
a new school record) might have
been a bit optimistic, the ultimate
goal of winning the ODAC seems
to be well within reach.

Sophomore outﬁelder James
Madden is having a great season,
including a .494 batting average,
ﬁve home runs, 26 RBI and an
astounding .909 slugging per-
centage. “James is just a hitting
machine,” says sophomore pitch-
er John Parker. “He trusts his
swing and plays with conﬁdence,
which is all you can ask for from
an everyday player.” Junior
designated hitter and outﬁelder
Richard Garland said, “James
has always been a great talent, he

just needed the opportunity to get
on the ﬁeld and show it.”

Garland himself has been an
integral part of the surging Gen-
erals offense, notching a .373
batting average.

Juniors David Miller and Jor-
dan Wesley, both expected to be
signiﬁcant contributors coming
into the season, have excelled at
the plate as well.

Miller, while bouncing be-
tween third base and left ﬁeld,
has hit .347 in a team-high 95
at-bats. Wesley is batting .333
with four home runs and 27 RBI
while starting all but one game at
catcher.

Senior first basemen Taylor
McConnell, expected to anchor
the offense, has been hampered
by a back injury this season.

McConnell has hit .319 with a
pair of home runs in 19 starts, but
has missed three games because
of the injury.

Although his back may not
ﬁilly heal for the remainder of
the season, McConnell has re-
turned to action this week.

While the offense has ex-
celled, the Generals have strug-
gled with inconsistencies in

pitching and defense.

Ace right-hander Clayton Ed-
wards has been sharp, posting a
6-0 record and 3.51 ERA while
holding opponents to a meager
.240 batting average.

Beyond Edwards, however,
the pitching staff has struggled to

ﬁnd its rhythm.
Junior southpaw Johnson
Brownlow had solid outings

against Emory & Henry and
Richard Stockton, but recently
allowed seven earned runs and
failed to ﬁnish the first inning
against Virginia Wesleyan.

Second behind Edwards in in-
nings pitched is Parker, who, at
1-3, has already walked ll batters
in 29 frames. '

In comparison, Parker allowed
just three free passes in 52 innings
a year go.

“It seems like every guy can
roll out on the mound one day and
throw great for ﬁve innings, and
then a week later look terrible,”
said Parker.

The Generals had also hoped
to ﬁnd a reliable reliever or two to
consistently ﬁnish games, but that
has not happened yet.

“We don’t yet have a guy who
can step in during the ninth [in-
ning] and shut a team down,” said
Wesley.

Vying for that role are a num-
ber of pitchers, of whom the most
consistent have been freshmen
right-handers Andrew Henderson
and Brendan Clark.

Throwing just 12.1 and 8.1
innings, respectively, Henderson e
and Clark have shown good con-
trol and the potential to see an in-
creased load down the stretch.

“Henderson and Clark will
have to throw plenty of innings
in the [ODAC] tournament,” said
Garland. “They will be crucial to
our tearn’s success.” ’

Other relievers that are ex-
pected to play a signiﬁcant role
are sophomores Steve Marcott
and Tim Livingston.

After a strong start, Marcott
has been inconsistent recently and
his ERA has slipped to 5.43.

Marcott said he had no com-
ment about his pitching.

Livingston’s ERA was inﬁn

James Madden has team is
highest batting average,

runs scored and hits while
baseball team starts 14- 7,

7-3 ODAC

By Steph Wlechmann
S T A F F W R I T E R

James Madden does not know
why he likes batting so much.

“I really can’t explain it. I re-
ally like stepping into the box.
I really like hitting the ball,” he
said. I

The sophomore outﬁelder from
Dallas’ love of batting is working
out well for the Washington and
Lee baseball team. Madden cur-
rently leads the team in ten batting
categories and is one triple away
from tying the school record.

For those baseball statisticians,
Madden’s numbers are startling.
Last season, he hit just .105 in 19
at-bats. This year, his current av-
erage is .494. It leaves fans won-
dering how he has improved.

“I made some changes to my
swing this fall,” said Madden.

“Instead of taking my hands di-
rectly to the ball, I try take my
hands in more rounded way to the
ball which allows me to get better
plate coverage and get good bat
speed.”

Madden bats ﬁfth in the start-
ing lineup, as a “sort of clean-up
hitter,” he said. In baseball strat-
egy, the third batter is usually the
best. Being surrounded by good
batters has also helped his stats.
“Everyone helps each other out,”
he said.

“James is one of the hard-
est workers on the team,” said
Andy McEnroe, fellow team-
mate and WLUR sports analyst.
“He worked all off-season in the
weight room getting stronger and
in the cages working on his swing.
Everyday he is one of the ﬁrst guys
at the ﬁeld and one of the last guys
to leave as he is constantly work-

ing on his swing.”

Head baseball coach Jeff
Stickley has also seen the dedica-
tion and work Madden has shown.
“He is in a groove now and he
is one of the best hitters in the
league,” said Stickley. “He has a
good attitude about his hitting and
practices — he keeps working on
his game and is not satisﬁed.”

In the upcoming weeks, the
Generals face tough ODAC op-
ponents Bridgewater, Roanoke
and Hampden-Sydney. Madden
does not like to stress himself out
before a game thinking about the
other teams.

“You can only control yourself
and how you get ready for the
game,” said Madden.

He starts out every pre-game
with the same throwing exercises
to warm up. And, he said, he al-
ways‘ sports eye black for confer-
ence games.

It is in the game where Mad-
den must change his style if he is
facing a difﬁcult pitcher.

“If the pitcher’s throwing
harder, you stand back in the box
and choke up,” Madden said.

He said the best way to think
about upcoming games is “not
overestimating anyone and
knowing you have to be on your
game.”

As far as the ODAC goes, he
said that there are a lot of good
teams this year. “Every confer-

ence game’s a challenge,” he said.
Madden is conﬁdent that the Gen-
erals are still going to give their
conference foes a run for their
money.

“We have a really good team
this year,” Madden said. “We ex-
pect to make a serious run at win-
ning the [ODAC] tournament.”

As for tying the triple record,
Madden is not ready to make a
prediction on when that will hap-
pen. “Could be tomorrow, could
be next game,” he said. “You

never really know.”

But, is Madden able to brea1-
the record?

“I’d like to,” he confesses.

But it isn’t his ﬁrst priority
“Breaking records is kind of 6
side effect of the game,” he said.

“Although his performance a‘
the plate and in the ﬁeld has beer
amazing,” said McEnroe, “James
is never selﬁsh, always putting
the team ﬁrst. James is a grea‘
ball player, a better teammate an(
an even better person.”

Sitting with Jeb

Students from Florida State
University, Florida A&M Uni-
versity and Tallahassee Com— .
munity College wrapped up

a 33 hour sit-in at Governor
Jeb Bush’s ofﬁce to protest the
death of 14-year-old Martin
Lee Anderson. Anderson died
after being beaten by security
guards at the juvenile boot
camp he had been sent to.
Last Friday Al Sharpton and
Jesse Jackson joined Ander-
son’s parents and the student
protesters in a march at the
capital. Anderson’s parents
and the protesters are calling
for action; 105 days have now
elapsed since their son died.
Gov. Bush ordered a sec-

ond autopsy performed on
Anderson’s body; the original
one said the 14-year-old died
of a sickle cell trait. Prelimi-
nary results from the second
autopsy appear to indicate An-
derson did not die of natural
causes. No arrests have been
made in the case.

Cops feeling foxy
This weekend’s Foxﬁeld
Races will be patrolled by
over 200 ofﬁcers from vari-
ous Virginia police agencies.
Plainclothes and uniformed
cops from the Virginia ABC
department, the Albemarle Po-
lice Department and Virginia
State Police will be patrolling
the event site and taking a no
tolerance policy. The depart-
ments will be monitoring race
visitors when they arrive,
checking for signs of intoxica-
tion or indications of underage
drinking. Anyone found to be
in violation of Virginia alco-
hol laws will not be allowed
into the race area.

I-81 expansion
Debate continues over the
proposed expansion of I-81.
Officials from the Virginia
Department of Transporta-
tion have been hosting public
meetings up and down the
I-81 corridor, which includes
Lexington. Some proposals
involve creating “truck only”
lanes, while others would
make the highway a toll road
for cars and trucks. The col-
lected tolls would help pay
for the cost of the interstate’s
repair and expansion. Op-
ponents of the expansion say
it will destroy the Shenandoah
Valley’s beauty and dramati-
cally increase air pollution.
One other proposal calls for
the expansion of the area’s rail
corridor to reduce the amount
of truck traffic on I-81.

University police arrest seventeen students at living wage sit-in

Though University of Virginia President John

NEWS EDITOR

The arrest of seventeen Uni-
versity of Virginia students on
April 15 has brought intense con-
troversy and debate to the school’s
normally apolitical grounds. Stu-
dents arguing that the university
should pay higher wages to entry-
level staff staged a four day sit-
in at the school’s administration
building Madison Hall.

The sit-in began on Wednes-
day, April 12 and ended Saturday
evening when the students were
arrested by university police of-
ﬁcers. One faculty member was
also arrested for trespassing when
she tried to enter Madison Hall
early in the standoff. Each stu-
dent faces trespassing charges
and, if found guilty, could be
ﬁned $2,500 dollars or sentenced
to a year in jail.

The Washington Post, Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch, The Daily
Progress and other Virginia news-
papers have covered the protests
and debates extensively, and local
television stations have also been
spending time on the grounds of
UVa.

Todd Rosenbaum, a spokes-
man for the UVa Living Wage
Campaign, said the arrests will
not stop continuing student pro-
tests.

“We’re looking to keep public
pressure on John Casteen. This
movement started with 15 people
and has grown to over 500 hun-
dred. We’re looking to engage in
other forms of direct action and
will have more protests.”

The UVa students argue that
the university’s lowest paid em-
ployees need a salary of $10.72
per hour plus beneﬁts to live in
Charlottesville, where the school

has been located since it was
founded by Thomas Jefferson.
The university currently pays its
lowest salaried employees $9.37
per hour and says that other ben-
eﬁts, including health care, raise
the hourly wage to $12.66.

One of the students’ chief
complaints is that the university
employs a large number of con-
tract workers. Companies that
work with the university, includ-
ing food service provider Ara-
mark, are not required to pay the
$9.37 minimum wage.

In March the university asked
the Attorney General’s office if
the school could force contrac-
tors to pay certain wages. The
Attorney General replied that
the school did not have the legal
authority to impose a minimum
wage on their contractors.

Carol Wood, Assistant Vice
President for University Relations
and the school ’s spokeswoman on
the issue, said the school is con-
strained in its choice of contrac-
tors by the state’s Procurement
Act. K

“As a public institution 
we’re required, in most cases, to
take the lowest bid,” she said.

Rosenbaum disputed the
school’s assertion that they can-
not affect the contractors’ wages.
“The Attorney General’s opinion
is just that — an opinion. There’s
no legal precedent, and Alexan-
dria and Arlington have living
wage ordinances. We don’t think
the Attorney General will chal-
lenge them.

The city of Charlottesville
has a minimum hourly wage of
$9.36. George Mason University,
located in Fairfax, Virginia, has a
minimum wage of $10.40. That

Students examine gender relations

Gender Relations Committee plans special
barbeque and future upperclassmen luncheon

By Stacey Grljalva
STAFF WRITER

A common complaint of up-
perclassmen is that men and
women do not interact as much
as they did freshmen year.

One student group, the Gen-
der Relations Committee (GRC)
has decided to tackle the issue
head on.

“The GRC wants to give
students more opportunities to
hang out together on campus,
broadening their selection of
activities,” said Kristen Powell,
assistant director of student ac-
tivities.

On Tuesday, the GRC will
have a campus-wide volleyball
game along with a barbeque on
the Canaan Green. People can
either sign up to play or jump in
during a game.

Then in May, the fratemi-
ties and sororities will have a
chance to eat lunch together in
Evans Dining Hall.

On that day, the Greek houses
will not offer lunch for the day.
Instead upperclassmen can eat
in Evans, recreating the fresh-

men experience of guys and gals
eating and interacting in d-hall.

“It’s something different,”
said Powell. “It’s a chance to eat
with different folk.”

FIJI President Andrew
Rothey, who has been working
closely with the committee on
the luncheon, agreed that it was
a great opportunity.

“Everyone can take advan-
tage of it to eat as men and
women,” said Rothey. “You can
also eat with other fratemities or
people that you don’t see any-
more.”

In the past, students repeated-
ly brought up the idea of forming

an occasion for men and women
to eat together instead of sepa-
rating at lunchtime to eat at their
respective houses.

The idea came up at the Day
of Dialogue in both 2005 and
2006 and at the most recent
Greek Summit.

“[For upperclassmen,] it’s
not the same as when you were
a freshman and just had to go up
or down a ﬂoor to see the oppo-
site gender,” said Matthew Loar,
the incoming chair of GRC.

If this trial run of the lun-
cheon goes well and students
support the event, then co-ed
lunches may become a monthly

“Normal gender relations are a way to get to

know each other and talk when not intoxicated.

It can be a meal, a walk together or going to

the movies. How well can you know somebody

when you ’re drunk? ”

JAN KAUFMAN, Director of Health Promotions
 

opportunity next year.

The luncheon will be open to
all upperclassmen. For indepen-
dents, the meal can swiped.

One past function of the GRC
is Date Night.

At the most recent Date
Night, held in November, stu-
dents swiped home vouchers for
restaurants around town.

“Date Night was our most
popular event,” said Loar. “Ob-
viously people like the idea of a
date. There’s something roman-
tic about it.” '

In fact, Powell said that one
student told her that it was his
“ﬁrst real date.”

That’s great news for the
GRC, whose primary mission is
to improve gender relations on
campus.

“Normal gender relations are
a way to get to know each other
and talk when not intoxicated,”
said Jan Kaufman, Director of
Health Promotions.

“It can be a meal, a walk to-
gether or going to the movies,”
she said. “How well can you
know somebody when you’re
drunk?”

As part of its mission, the
GRC also focuses on sexual as-
sault on campus. A current proj-
ect is a comprehensive booklet
on sexual misconduct, includ-
ing what to do if it happens to

you, what to do if it happens to
a friend, information about con-
sent and statistics.

It will be given to incoming
freshmen but should be avail-
able to other students at matric-
ulation.

“Sexual assault is a big is-
sue,” said Loar. “It shouldn’t
happen as much as it does. The
hooking up culture fosters a lot
of the problems that lead to sex-
ual assault.”

By providing opportuni-
ties to interact without alcohol,
GRC hopes to reduce the high
number of sexual assaults at
Washington and Lee.

The results from a recent stu-
dent health survey will tell the
GRC how great an impact they
have had.

No matter the results, the
GRC will keep working to help
W&L students.

Jennifer Sayre, co-adviser of
GRC and school counselor, is
hopeful about the the changes
the committee will bring to
campus, mostly because the or-
ganization is student-run.

“It has been my experience
that most important changes at
W&L are student driven,” said
Sayre.

“When students become in-
volved and concerned, great
progress is made,” she said.

BHID
BARS

Here is the latest update on who
ran afoul of the law during the last
few weeks. We took a peek at this
weeks police reports to see what

you ’ve been up to...

 

DUls on the rise?
Wesley Whagner was ar-
rested and charged with a
DUI Sunday, March 26.
Whagner, who lives near
the Natural Bridge area,

. was stopped for driving 42

mph in a 25mph zone.

Mind the signs

Mark Cruciani, a resident of
Clarks Summit, Pennsylva-
nia, was arrested on Friday,
March 24. Cruciani was ar-
rested around 11:30pm out-
side of Malone’s restaurant.
He was charged with public
drunkenness and damage of
property less than $1000.
The responding ofﬁcer ar-
rived at the Palms, where

a person reported that Cru-
ciani was damaging property
at Malone’s. After exiting
the restaurant, Cruciani re-
portedly ripped a banner off
the side of the building and
began tearing it up. He then
kicked in a window on the
wall of the Malone’s build-
ing.

Double trouble

The residents of 106 Tay-
lor Street continue to have
problems with the police.
In December one person

was charged with a DIP and
another was charged with a
DUI on the same night. This
time Emmanuel Harris was
charged with a DIP. The ar-
rest was made around 8:30
p.m. on Saturday, April 1.

Not just a young
person’s pastime

Goshen resident Paul Reth-
ford was also arrested and
charged with a DIP on April‘
1. Rethford, age 75, was ar-
rested around 7:20 p.m.

Always get the proper
Hcense

Lexington resident Mar-

tin Nicholas was charged
with attempting to obtain
money by false pretense, a
felony charge. According
to Lexington Police Chief
Bruce Beard, the arrest was
made on Wednesday, April 5
around 8 p.m. Nicholas was
also charged with attempt-
ing to practice bail bonding
without a license. That
charge is a misdemeanor.
The offenses were commit-
ted in Rockbridge County,
not Lexington, but Lexing-

ton oiﬁcers served the war-
rants.

Drunk walkers
beware

26-year-old Jonathan
Strumb was arrested around
9 p.m. on Friday, April 7.
He was charged with public
drunkenness.

Unfriendly ﬁsticuffs
Linda Lasley and Katrina
Zirkle have charged each
other with simple assault.
Police Chief Bruce Beard
said the two had ﬁled what
is called cross warrants
against each other. Essen-
tially each woman claimed
that the other woman as-
saulted her. The incident
was reported around noon
on Saturday, April 8. Lasley
is a Lexington resident, and
Zirlke listed her address as
Harrisonburg, Virginia.

The one way sign
strikes again

Thomas Clarke, age 25, was
arrested on DUI charges on
Saturday, April 8. The ar-
rest occurred around 9 p.m.
Beard said Clarke was ar-
rested on Jackson Avenue.
He was stopped because he
was traveling the wrong way
on a one way street. He was

issued a ticket for that as
well as for failing to obey a
“Do Not Enter” sign.

Driving recklessly
won't help you hide

Richard Clark was arrested
and charged with driving un-
der the inﬂuence on April 8.
The time of arrest was listed
as 11:22 p.m., and Clark was
also charged with reckless
driving. Furthermore, he
was ticketed for failing to
have registration.

Back to back

Fairﬁeld, Virginia resident
Edgar Bryant was ar-
rested two days in a row
and charged with public
drunkenness. The ﬁrst DIP
arrest came on the morning
of Sunday, April 9, and the
second arrest came Mon-
day night. Beard reported
that both arrests came in a
parking lot garage. During
the Sunday arrest, Oﬂicers
Stewart and Coffey reported
that Bryant showed signs of
public intoxication, and on
Monday, Officer Fitzgerald
said Bryant showed indica-
tions of intoxication, in-
cluding slurred speech and
bloodshot eyes.

Protests continue at UVa despite student arrests

continued from page 1

school’s wage reﬂects the high
cost of living in the Washington,
D.C. area. Virginia Military In-
stitute and University of Virginia
at Wise, in contrast, have a mini-
mum hourly wage of only $6.83.

Wood said reports that the
students were going hungry were
overblown.

“President Casteen asked them
if they needed food and at least
one said they were ﬁne. They lat-
er voted to accept some food and
we delivered it to them.”

Once the sit-in began, UVa
police ofﬁcers limited access to
Madison Hall. “We limited the
people coming in,” Wood said,
“because with seventeen people
in the lobby it made daily opera-
tion difficult.”

Casteen eventually order the
students to be arrested because
of the disruptions the sit-in was
causing for university employees.

“I’d say if we combined po-
lice and staff maybe 60-80 people
were working,” Wood said, “but
that’s around the clock. Not all
of those people were there at one
time.”

Wende Marshall, an assistant
professor of Anthropology, was
arrested on Wednesday, April 12
when she tried to get inside Madi-
son Hall. Wood referred ques-
tions about Marshall’s arrest to
the university police, saying that
the arrest was “really a police
matter.”

University professors have
been largely supportive of the
student demonstrators, holding
teach-ins and speaking at the daily
rallies. On Wednesday, April 19,
223 UVa faculty members issued
a press release urging Casteen to
approve the proposed wage in-
creases.

“Luckily professors and facul-
ty have been tremendous and very
supportive. The students inside
[Madison Hall] haven’t faced any
academic punishments and sanc-
tions. Thankfully the movement
is big enough for other people to
cover for you when you need to
go get things done,” Rosenbaum
said.

Mo Nichols, a recycling techni-
cian at UVa, provided an insider’s
perspective on the issue. When
asked if she thought UVa would
meet the protesters’ demands, she

offered an interesting answer.

“I don’t like to think of them
as bending so much as I think
of them as standing up and say-
ing everyone who works at UVa
-— contract or regular workers
— deserves to make a fair wage.”

Nichols said that very few
of her colleagues are getting in-
volved with the issue.

“What I’ve noticed is that
very few [employees] are en-
gaged. There’s a real culture of
fear among employees. People
in poverty don’t know the power
they have.” she said.

Washington and Lee’s acting-
president, Harlan Beckley, is well
aware of living wage and poverty
issues.

Beckley helped found the

W&L’s Shepherd Poverty Pro-
gram. Beckley said the school
pays a minimum hourly wage of
$9.00.

“The difference [between UVa
and W&L] is that [UVa is] con-
tracting out some jobs. We don’t
have very much of that,” Beckley
said. “By design this is a com-
munity staff.”

“I don’t know how productive
communications are if they exist,”
Nichols said. “Things move very
slowly and people don’t have a
lot of faith in getting action.”

Beckley said he could not
imagine ever having to arrest stu-
dents camped out in Washington
Hall. “I wouldn’t say never, but I
can’t imagine it,” he said.

While UVa does offer some

* courses on poverty, acting-Presi-

dent Beckley said that the Shep-
herd Poverty Program has im-
proved understanding of poverty
issues at W&L.

“I’d like to think that because
of the poverty courses students

' and faculty have become more

conscious of the issue,” he said.
“Does that mean our compensa-
tion is adequate and we don’t
need to do anything more? No.”

Charles Shackelford, a ﬁrst
year student at UVa, said that stu-
dents are conscious of the issue
but not all are involved.

“We had our school elections
last month,” Shackelford said,
“and about 80 percent voted to
have the school use a living wage
of take the issue to the General

Assembly. People agree with the
proposal but don’t realize some-
body has to pay for it.”

“People like to avoid poor
people,” Mo Nichols said. “They
don’t realize how bad it is and
how many full—time employees at
UVa have two or three jobs and
are part of the working poor.

As all parties involved in the
debate look ahead, serious dis-
putes remain between the differ-
ent parties.

On Thursday, April 20, Cas-
teen issued a letter to the commu-
nity regarding competitive com-
pensation. Casteen met, without
success, with the sit-in protesters
on several occasions. A student
forum on poverty will occur on
Tuesday, April 15.

spokeswoman, said. “We’d like
to move from an adversarial role

commented on why this issue has

THE RING-TUM PHI" 3

 

to the editor

: Parent questions double standard

I!

V

To the Editor:

I have attempted to “join the
conversation" on the strategic
plan and provide some feedback
in an effort to help point out what
I believe is a policy that is detri-
mental to the University.

I received no response. After
three weeks, a follow-up email
and telephone call, I was brushed
off and advised that since I dis-
agreed with University policy
that I need not join the conversa-
tion. The Provost’s response, or
lack of one, to my e-mails speaks
volumes.

To the Provost:

I emailed the Admissions De-
partment about this issue and I
was advised by Jonathan Webster,
Associate Dean of Admissions,

: that “W&L’s Board of Trustees

sets the institution’s admission
policies and has aﬂirmed the val-
ue of ethnic diversity on campus
and its consideration in our (the)
admission decision-making.”
Sarah Kientz’ article, Minor-
ity Report, in the Ring-tum Phi,
published on Parents’ Weekend,
reported that at Washington and
Lee “many believe that minority

students are favored in the admis-
sions process.” However, Admis-
sions Counselor Charlie Boisky
admitted that the Admissions De-
partment gives many incentives,
including ﬁnancial, to minority
students to expose them to the
campus and to get them to apply;
however, everyone is on equal
ground when it comes to applying
to W&L. He further added that
no students are accepted based on
ethnicity and that “minority stu-
dents are every bit as qualiﬁed as
everyone else.” Erin Hutchinson,
Assistant Director of Admissions
and Coordinator of Minority Re-
cruitment, said that minority sta-
tus often comes into play when
the department is “separating
equals.” I strongly suspected that
the quoted Adrnission’s Officers
were spinning their responses and
not being forthright in regards to
black and Hispanic applicants.
Also, during Parents’ Week-
end, Harlan Beckley gave the
President’s Report to Parents, in
the Lee Chapel, with a large fo-
cus on diversity. Afterwards, in a
question and answer session, he
responded to a parent’s question

To the Editor:

I was very unhappy to receive
an email promoting the “Celebrat-
ing Women at W&L” event. At
ﬁrst glance, I truly thought it was
a joke. With topics such as “Be

’ Comfortable in ‘your GENES”

and “Honor and Feminist Eth-
ics,” I was sure that W&L could
not have become just another
university, catering to those who
worship at the altar of political
correctness.

This event purports to cele-
brate coeducation at W&L, but by
its very existence further divides
the sexes. Celebrating half of the
student body is as offensive and
discriminatory as having a “Men’s
Day,” or “Celebrating White
People at W&L” day. Why not

celebrate the accomplishments
of men at W&L? Certainly, men
have done SOMETHING worthy
of celebration in the ﬁrst 90 per-
cent of W&L’s history? Why is
there a “women.wlu.edu” and no
“men.wlu.edu?” Isn’t that a huge
double standard? Why not cel-
ebrate the admission of African
Americans? Or homosexuals? Or
Jews? Haven’t these groups also
added to the W&L experience?
Without question, the admit-
tance to women was one of the
most signiﬁcant improvements
to Washington and Lee over the
course of its 250-plus year his-
tory. As a member of the Class
of 1989, I saw the transition ﬁrst
hand. The women who enrolled
were not trail-blazing feminists

THE RING-TUM PHI IS A

about that same article, Minority
Report, in a rather unsatisfactory
manner. The questioner asked if
minorities are given preference
in the application for admissions
process. In fairness, President
Beckley acknowledged that he
had not read the article, but he
went on without answering the
question to express repeatedly
how important he believed racial
diversity is to the University with-
out substantiating the beneﬁts or
expressing what costs there might
be to increasing racial diversity.
After this event concluded, I
overheard more than just a few
other parents in discreet and po-
lite conversations discussing this
issue.

Jonathan Webster and I had
a brief discussion at Glenelg
Country School about that article.
He acknowledged that numer-
ous types of incentives, includ-
ing ﬁnancial, are offered only
to minority students in an effort
to have them gain interest in the
University and apply. He went
even further by analogizing the
preferences the Admissions De-
partment offers minority students

in admission by expressing, “It's
no different from how we treat
athletes or legacies.” Those were
his words, not mine. So that there
was no misunderstanding he fur-
ther explained “that it is the only
way we can get them in.”

In the Strategic Plan, the Ad-
missions Task Force lists one of
their charges as follows: increase
American racial and ethnic diver-
sity on campus to a level approxi-
mating the mean among rural, na-
tional liberal arts colleges. What
discemable difference is there be-
tween this goal and a quota?

I emailed Dean Hartog request-
ing standardized test score data
for the entering freshman class
for the past ten years, broken out
by ethnicity. Unfortunately, Dean
Hartog very courteously declined
to honor my request. A different
member of the Administration,
who shall remain anonymous in-
formed me, in writing, that the in-
formation I requested is regularly
tabulated and readily available.
So what is any reasonable person
to conclude? If the Admissions
Department is unwilling to release
this information it is because they

celebrating

with an agenda to “right a wrong”
at W&L. They didn’t enroll to
end 200 years of oppression.
They enrolled to be a part of the
tradition, not to end it. They were
well-rounded, intelligent women
who were there for the conserva-
tive, honorable,‘ highly respected
education. The very reason they
came to W&L was to become a
part of the community, not to cre-
ate a separate group at the Univer-
sity. They didn’t get upset when
Professor F utch made them wear
ties to class. It didn’t bother them
when the campus watering hole
was called the “Cockpit.” They
were not there to be a separate
class but to be a part of the Uni-
versity.

Clearly, the addition of women

has greatly enhanced the univer-
sity in many ways. Some of my
best life-long friends are women
from the ﬁrst class. It is extremely
upsetting and disappointing to
see how PC W&L has become in
20 short years. The unfortunate
thing is that this shift in attitude
is permanent, as there are a great
number of alums being alienated
by these positions. I received an
email from a fraternity brother of
mine last week. It was short, but
prophetic. “Our W&L is dead,
never to retum.” I hope that is
not the case, but I fear that W&L
is becoming just another PC liber-
al arts university. Resist the urge

to follow the ﬂock.

It’s protest season

Ah, spring.

The time of year ﬁlled with
sunshine and ﬂowers brings with
it something worse than allergies:

Protest season.

It seems to be a nation-wide
phenomenon.

Suddenly, as students emerge
from the conﬁnes of their cinder-
block living structures and realize
that there is, in fact, a world out-
side of exams, they realize injus-
tice around them.

Locally, the protests at the Uni-
versity of Virginia sprang up after
students had been fairly stagnant
on the issue all winter.

But that is not the only place
students have taken up a cause.

In Florida, students from three
colleges held a sit-in in the state
capitol, demanding investigation
into the death of a 14-year-old
boy at a boot camp.

In Washington, several groups
are meeting, including some from
Washington and Lee.

There are Earth Day protests,
and vigils against oppression,
and marches against genocide all
month.

Could be that this is coinciden-
tally a very politically—charged
time in our lives.

Or, the weather is nice and it
beats going to class.

The Phi is certainly never
against using your Constitutional
rights to help institute change in
your government.

By all means, get out there and
shout--but only if you believe in
the cause.

The students at UVa seemed

surprised that they were actually
arrested for holding a sit-in.

They thought it was not fair
that they were denied food and
comfort.

For some reason, the glamor-
ized image of protesting has led
students to think it’s easy.

Throw a ﬁt, get what you want,
right?

Not in the real world.

The students at UVa should
have considered other routes be-
fore going off the deep end.

For example, could they, for a
moment, sit down and reasonably
consider the implications of their
demands?

How would the school pay
higher wages to its employees?

By raising the students’ tu-
ition, of course.

But because the students do not
actually pay tuition, it becomes an
imaginary number: largely con-
fusing and easy to ignore.

Without fully understanding
the implications of their actions,
students will like the idea of mak-
ing a difference and rush to make
posters and camp out in public
lobbies.

The school was probably
wrong, but more just stupid, to ar-
rest the 17 students camping out
in their administrative buildings.

Because now they have an
army of stir-crazy students just
waiting to jump on the bandwag-
on of anything touting goodwill.

And during protest season,
anything can happen.

This represents the majority
opinion of the editorial board.

have something to hide and are
not being forthright. If there is
nothing to hide, you put it on the
Institutional Research site.

So what do I make of this?
The Consortium on Financing
Higher Education (COFHE) com-
piled and shared SAT scores, and
other statistics, on entering class-
es at 26 of the nation’s top col-
leges and universities with those
member schools. The difference
between black and white scores
was less than 100 points at only
one school, Harvard. It exceeded
200 points at nine schools. So,
to think that at W&L, which has
increased black enrollment more
than 100 percent in the last de-
cade, is only using race as a way
of “separating equals” is so sta-
tistically improbable, bordering
on impossible, that it can’t help
but stir up suspicion and resent-
ment. Do I have a problem with
minorities attending W&L? No.
Unequivocally, if a student of any
race is the best academically qual-
iﬁed and merits a position I salute
him. But, I do have a problem
with helping one group of people
by hurting another group. What I

do believe with every ﬁber of my
body is that skin color should not
be a factor, one way or the other.
I appreciated Jonathan Webster’s
candor. And I respect his sincer-
ity, though I do not agree, that an
admission’s policy of preferences
for minorities is necessary to en-
rich the educational experience of
all.

I received the Feb. 27 copy
of the Ring-tum Phi, which con-
tained the article Urban Devel-
opment. It describes the Posse
Foundation Program. How is it
that the youthful, inexperienced
founder of the Posse, Deborah
Bial, has miraculously developed
an alternative way to judge a stu-
dents capabilities? I ask that you
revisit these policies. The Posse
program should be summarily re-
jected. Please know that I have
a sophomore in high school that
will be making her college deci-
sion in the not too distant future.
I would love for her to attend
W&L; however, your consider-
ation of this matter will rightfully
be a consideration for her.

Chi Omega freshman form an intimidating offensive line during the sorority football tournament on Thursday

Down and Derby

Derby Days is for a good cause, but the competition can be brutal

By Bree Melton
smrr woman

Hosted by Sigma Chi chapters
across the nation, Derby Days is a
week of events coordinated with
the intention of reaching out to
the community.

lt seems of late, though, that
the original aims of promoting
brotherhood, the spirit of commu-
nity service and a positive Greek
image have fallen by the wayside
for exclusive parties and inter-so-
rority rivalry.

The ﬁrst week of spring term
ﬁnds the five sororities on campus
pitted against each other despite a
yearlong campaign encouraging
Panhellenic unity as they vie for
the affections and approval of the
brothers of Sigma Chi.

All in the name of good fun
and fundraising for Campus
Kitchens, sorority women began
the week by participating in ﬁeld
day activities ranging from dizzy

bat to egg toss to tug of war.

The week continued with a
cook-off, powder puff football
and skits. In addition, the soror-
ity women competed in a banner
competition and penny race.

Each event was scored, and
the sorority with the most points
won Derby Days.

This year Kappa came out on
top with Theta in a close second.

Though most people ﬁnd it
hard to believe that there is, in
fact, a philanthropic motive be-
hind the events of Derby Days.
There was an entrance fee for the
cook—off.

Each sorority donated $150 -

and all of the proceeds went to
Campus Kitchens, “a ground-
breaking initiative that brings
colleges and universities together
with student volunteers, on-cam-
pus dining services professionals,
and community organizations to
combat hunger in cities across the
United States.”

3.;

With such a visible and nation-
ally recognized event, the frater-
nity has the opportunity to use
Derby Days as a way to promote
a positive image of Greek life and
really give back to the commu-
nity.

But somehow the true mean-
ing of Derby Days is lost among
the drive to put on great parties,
chug beer and make fools of the
sorority women, especially the
new initiates.

Says one junior, “[Derby Days]
is a fun relaxing way to start off
spring tenn and a good way to
spend time with your sisters.”

Not all would agree with
this statement. For most soror-
ity women, it can be stressful
coordinating an impressive skit,
organizing a football team with
little or no help from the assigned
Sigma Chi coaches and painting
a banner all in the ﬁrst week of a
new academic term.

One of the biggest problems
the sororities face, especially
with the administration moving to
make spring term more academi-
cally rigorous, is encouraging at-
tendance not only to participate
in the different events, but also
to provide support and spirit for
their sisters.

Dean Watkins commented that
she did not know much about Der-
by Days because, even though she
was aware of it during her own
college years, it was not nearly as

‘consuming on her campus as it

is here at Washington and Lee.
She believes that this is a
function of the predominance
of the Greek system among the
student population.
Unfortunately, this means
that there is a signiﬁcant group

of students noticeably left out '

of the festivities.

While Derby Days is tradi-
tionally a good time remem-
bered for aftemoon bands,
hilarious misadventures and
sorority tomfoolery, the true
goal of Derby Days seems only
secondary.

As it departs more and more
from the charitable objective,
the events of Derby Days fall
dangerously close to exploiting
the sorority women who par-
ticipate in the competition.

Spring term should be a
time for enjoying friends and
exploring new opportunities.

And Derby Days should
serve as an example to the rest
of the campus by setting phil-
anthropic goals and creating
awareness for important issues
all the while encouraging rela-
tionships between Greek orga-
nizations.

If Sigma Chi focuses on
ncouraging friendly competi-
tion, Derby Days can still fos-
ter the sense of fun and relax-
ation with which spring term at
W&L has become associated.

Remembering
the Holocaust

Hillel sponsors numerous events to
commemorate the victims and keep
us from forgetting the Holocaust

By Abrl Nelson
STAFF WRITER

In the midst of the excitement
of spring falls Yom HaShoah,
the official Jewish holiday com-
memorating the Holocaust, which
is marked by events to celebrate
diversity, and serves to remind us
of the intolerance and abuse that
resulted from undeserved hatred.

The officers of Hillel, Wash-
ington and Lee’s student-run J ew-
ish community, decided to bring
Holocaust Remembrance Week to
campus last year at the suggestion
of sophomore Arie George. Hillel
groups across the nation organize
events such as lectures and vari-
ous kinds of gatherings on Yom
HaShoah, which is April 25 this
year.
The Hebrew word “shoah”
means destruction, and the holi-
day is meant as a time to remem-
ber the six million Jews and ﬁve
million other victims who died in
the Holocaust, but also as a time
to raise awareness about hate and
prejudice.

“I look at Holocaust Remem-
brance Week as a tool to educate
people about the greater problems
that are associated with hatred
and bigotry,” said junior Justine
Dargahi, the executive president
of Hillel.

Planned activities include the
showing of two movies in the
John  Elrod Commons Theater,
a candlelight vigil in front of Lee
Chapel, a special Yom HaShoah
service, a scroll signing event
in the Commons Atrium and a

speech featuring George Salton, a
Holocaust survivor.

“It is our hope that such a
tragedy never happens again any-
where, to any people,” said Hil-
lel faculty sponsor Joan Robins.
Robins added that the activities of
the week are meant to be for all
students and that anyone is wel-
come at any event.

Salton, the author of the well-
known Holocaust memoir The
23rd Psalm, is a friend of Darga-
hi’s family and is ﬂying to Lext
ington from Florida for the talk,
which will be followed by a book
signing.

“There is no better way to learn
about the Holocaust than to hear
the ﬁrst hand story of survival,”
said Dargahi. “People become
more passionate about something
if they know or have met some-
one personally affected by it.”

The candlelight vigil in front
of Lee Chapel is the newest ad-
dition to the program and will be
led by Burr Datz, W&L’s Coordi-
nator of Religious Life.

According to Dargahi, it is
meant to be a way for students to
speak out against oppression in
any form, be it racial, sexual, reli-
gious or anything else. The event
is co-sponsored by the W&L Mul-
tifaith Council.

“I feel that everyone on cam-
pus should be affected in some
way by the week,” said Dargahi.
“The more we work to educate
people and learn about past atroc-
ities that have been spawned from
hatred, the less likely things like
the Holocaust will happen.”

THE RING-TUM PHI ° 5

Debauchery in denial

Is Derby Days a shameless exhibition or the best part of Spring Term?

SHE SAID

Another spring term, another
set of Derby Days which brings
us another round of penny col-
lecting, t- shirt buying, and pow-
der-puif football.

We ﬁnd ourselves donning
our newly purchased spring term
clothing and heading out to Pole
3 or the Dojo and even out to Ja-
cob’s Ladder.

There we ﬁnd ourselves
crowded into these houses and
forced to bump back and forth
between people on our way to the
bathroom. Ahhhh... I love spring
term.

Why do we do it? Why do
freshmen girls ﬁght to the death
to win this competition?

Is it just to hook up with the
fabulous men of the Sigma Chi
house? Understandable.

Are you tapping into your
charitable side for that wonder-
ful new organization on campus
known as Campus Kitchen Pro-
gram? You’re a better person
than me.

Or do you just want to win?
Yeah you do.

The glory and you’re srat
pledge class picture in the paper is
enough to make any girl yell “(in-
sert sorority here) what?” Some
of these girls seem willing to do
anything to win.

Desperately they collect coins
from the comers of couches at
random party houses and frat
basements.

Even their domestic side
comes out as they call up mom
and ask her how to marinade the
steaks they plan on serving on the
frat lawn.

All of this competition in the
name of tradition. Welcome to
Dubyahnell.

I personally am a fan of Derby
Days. Why is it that when girls
play football behind the pole
houses it’s a “shameless exhibi-
tion of women” but when they do
it for something else- like a school
ﬁinction, people consider it ok?

Let the girls play. They’re
having fun. CKP is making mon-
ey. Sigma Chi is hosting another
successful Derby Days.

It’s spring term- most profes-

sors are lucky if students show up .

to their aﬁemoon classes sober let
alone at all.

It is meant to be enjoyed by
all, and Derby Days is the best
way to introduce freshmen to
these wonderful six weeks.

I don’t know why the adminis-
tration thinks we’ll want
to spend our spring

  
  
   

HE SAID

Last year I was forced to miss
Derby Days due to athletic ob-
ligations, and after witnessing
all of the festivities last week, I
must say that I was extremely im-
pressed.

Of course, it wasn’t the sorori-
ties or their activities that leﬁ me
in awe.

It was the power of Sigma Chi
to convince girls to partake in the
debauchery that was truly impres-
sive.

Perhaps Derby Days
is merely Sigma

term anywhere Chi’s way of
else. proving their

Then we’re to get girls
just taking dmnk and
our spring terms d8I1C€ around,

with us. v

I know that those
abroad wish that they could have
taken Derby Days with them to
their assorted locations, But alas,
they cannot- making them jealous
of all of us here.

Not to worry--those abroad
just need to thank the creators
of hil1humor.com for only taking
one class so they can keep the site
updated.

V Derby Days is just one part of
spring term, but it remains one of
the best parts.

So thank the men of Sigma
Chi for letting us partake in their
tradition. Tradition is after all
what makes Washington and Lee,
Washington and Lee.

Maybe we’re not speaking as
much on the hill anymore, but
we are chatting it up out at these
functions such as Derby Days.

So just go and enjoy yourself
this spring term. I know I will.

This weeks Hot Topic was written by

columnists Tim Livingston and Madeline Gent.

 
 

whereas the Sigma
Chi’s employ the likes
of Clayton Edwards to persuade
girls to get inebriated and amuse
the frat lords.

Derby Days is a contest remi-
niscent of something that would
take place in a land where males
contain power over their female
counterparts.

Last time I checked, this meta-
phorical realm that Sigma Chi has
created doesn’t reﬂect our con-
temporary society.

This begs the query, what
makes girls participate in these
events for this obviously domi-
nant fraternity?

Although my friend Mad-
eline Gent suggested that Derby
Days represents a means for the
forlorn princesses of W&L to be
swooped up by the classy, fratty,
and sophisticated men of Sigma
Chi, I feel there must be another
answer.

First of all, those who argue
that girls partake in these silly
fraternity games because the pro-
ceeds go to a good cause are deﬁ-
nitely mistaken.

I believe I’ve discovered the
true reason why sorority women,
who are used to being venerated
and pampered by fratemity men,
agree to take part in Derby Days.

The reason does not reside in
the awesome men of Sigma Chi
(even though guys like Richard
Simms might disprove this theo-
ry); on the other hand, the spring
term festivities are a result of the
female desire to always be the
center of attention.

In reality, how would Derby
Days be affected if there was no
sorority involvement and the con-
tests were ousted?

Nothing would change be-
cause for all those who aren’t
Sigma Chi’s, Derby Days is not
about the competitions.

The week’s fun only relies on
the fratastic parties.

In fact, I believe all who at-
tended the DOJO on Thursday
would agree that the only damper
on the night was when the crowd
was hushed to allow the sororities
to present their skits.

Whoever seriously believed
that a majority of the party desired
to halt mingling and macking (if
that’s a real word) on hotties to
watch a couple of sorority girls
make fools of themselves was
greatly removed from the general
consensus.

Many contend that Derby
Days is demeaning to women, and
feel that is the primary reason for
modifying the week’s activities.

I maintain that sorority in-
volvement in Sigma Chi’s week
of parties is superﬂuous and an-
noying.

Maybe I’m envious that girls
dislocate shoulders and puke on
themselves for a cooler fraternity,
but I feel I speak for the whole
non-Sigma Chi male community
when I say this:

None of us care that Kappa
Kappa Gamma won the grueling
competition.

Until sororities sponsor a tour-
nament in which I have an excuse
to drink all day and play football,
I refuse to support Derby Days
unless sororities are totally taken
out of the picture.

How to land your dream job

The end of the school year is rapidly approach-

ing as seniors are for employment and under-

classmen are looking for internships and sum-

mer jobs. A&L Editor Kathryn Krall gives you

what you need to ace the interview.

WHAT TO SAY

Practice commonly asked
questions. Ask a friend to play
the part of the interviewer and go
through the possible questions.

Some examples:

° What have you achieved that

makes you proud?

° Why should we hire you

rather than the other candi-

dates?

- What is a weakness that

could hinder your perfor-

mance?

Be honest. W&L students are
terrible liars, probably because
we have been out of practice for
so long, so don’t even try.

In addition to honesty about
accomplishments, be sincere
about weaknesses as well. When
the interviewer asks about your
faults, do not give him or her the
classic “I am just too perfect,”
but rather elaborate on a weak-
ness that you will be able to de-

velop into a strength.

Research the company before-
hand. This sharpens you ability
to give answers that will enable
that interviewer to imagine you
working for the business. The
more you understand both the
activities and the overall business
philosophy of the organization,
the better prepared you will seem
to ﬁt in.

Make the interview a two-way
conversation. This is as much
about you getting to know the
company as it is about them get-
ting to know you. Look around.
Can you see yourself working for
this company? If the interviewer
asks if you have any questions,
use this time to determine wheth-
er you would ﬁt in.

Use lots of examples. Instead
of speaking in abstract terms, use
concrete examples to describe
your talents. Instead of “I work

well with others” say, “I worked
as a member of a group to suc-
cessfully complete a project.”
Tout yourself, but instead of us-
ing adjectives, use stories.

WHAT TO WEAR

Be conservative. Now is not
the time to make a fashion state-
ment. Go easy on thejewelry,
and tone down the nail polish
and make-up.

Dress accordingly. Try to ﬁt
your attire to the style of com-
pany, but dress a notch or two
more formally.

Be modest. Made sure the
hemlines are not too high or the
necklines too low. Remember,
you are selling your brains.
Girls, wear stockings.

Follow conventional rules.
You know, no white after Labor
Day and all the other delightful
rules your mother taught you.

No ﬂip-ﬂops.

HOW TO ACT

Smile. Even the most quali-
ﬁed applicant can be turned
away for lack of common cour-
tesy.

Make sure your handshake

is conﬁdent. Also, a non-
sweaty handshake is preferred.
If you are nervous, wipe your
hands on a tissue just before
you begin your interview.

Make eye contact. This
shows your conﬁdence and is
a sign of respect to the inter-
viewer. Lack of eye contact is
an immediate tum off.

Don’t be afraid to pause. A
moment of silence may seem
awkward, but the interviewer
knows you need to plan what

James paves the way

Sophomore is skills have the Generals rankea’ seventeenth in the nation

By Kathryn Krall
ARTS 8: LIFE EDITOR

With straight soaring drives,
consistently low scores and un-

' shakable poise, Nathaniel James

is an essential contributor to the
success of the golf team and is
establishing a reputation for
himself on the national level.
He has the lowest scoring
average on the team and has tal-

talent extends
(Amherst: Va-l beyond stats.
April 24 and 25 He provides

an example
of hard work and a burning de-
sire to win that motivates the
entire team to play their best.

James was taught to play
golf by his father, who began
instructing him at a very young
age.

“I don’t remember when I
started because I was so young,”
said James.

He competed in his ﬁrst tour-
nament at age six. James played
at first because it was a family

event, but he found the competi-
tion enjoyable.

“When I was young, I won
a lot. That kept me interested,”
said James.

James’ older brother is also
a golfer. As a young golfer, he
looked up to his big brother,
both wanting to be like him and
wanting to beat him.

“Part of the reason I wanted
to get better was to be able to
win against him," said James.

There was always a good—na-
tured competition between the
brothers.

“In some sense there is a ri-
valry between us,” said James,
“but we always cheer for each
other.”

As a freshman, James’ con-

tribution to the team was im-
mediate. In his ﬁrst year of
college golf he place second at
the ODAC championship. He
was named ODAC Rookie of
the Year, and First Team All-
ODAC. James won W&L Male
Freshman Athlete of the Year.
His outstanding performance
continued this year. For the
week of March 29, James was
named ODAC Co-Golfer of the
Week. He has paced the team in
wins, and earlier in the season
he had the lowest putting aver-
age of any player in the nation.
James’ strength is his short
game, which includes shots in
and around the green. His fa-
vorite aspect has also been a
struggle in the last few weeks.

“Right now, putting is my
weakness,” he said, “I’m in a
putting funk.”

The highlight of the season
both for James and for the en-
tire team came at the Virginia
State Championship, which was
won by the Washington and Lee
team. James was tied for ﬁrst,
and in a dramatic ﬁnish defeated
his competitor to win the tour-
nament.

A low point for James was
the Jekyll Island tournament.
James held the lead for two
rounds, but choked in the third
round to ﬁnish in a disappoint-
ing eleventh place.

James sees golf in his fu-
ture. “If I continue to improve,
I would like to play golf profes-

sionally, at least for a while,” he

said.

Due to his outstanding per-
formance this year, James may
possibly compete at Nation-
als. The announcement will be
made on May 1. -

The team is currently ranked
seventheenth in the nation, and
will compete at ODAC Champi-
onships on April 23-24, in Pop-
lar Grove, Virginia.

Optimistic about loss

After disappointing showing, lacrosse says it can improve

By Madeline Gent
STAFF WRITER

The men’s lacrosse team re-
mained busy over break and the
beginning of spring term improv-
ing their record to 5-5 and 2-3 in
ODAC play.

With games against Roanoke,
Guilford and Virginia Wesleyan
during Spring Break, the Gener-
als found themselves progressing
while preparing to qualify for the

- ODAC tournament.

The generals lost to Roanoke
16-7 on April 9 but defeated Guil-
ford 13-3 on April 12. Freshman
midﬁelder Harry St. John led the
Generals to a 11-5 victory over
Virginia Wesleyan on April 15.
St. John scored_a career-high four
goals.

set as a freshman... He draws the
best defensive midﬁelders from
the other team. It’s a real testa-
ment to the kind of season he is
having,” coach Mike Cerino said
of the April 16 ODAC player of
the week.

Sophomore Ned Rider, who
netted four goals in the three
games, said of the play over
break, “It was a tough loss against
Roanoke. It was all mental, and
I think we’ll get them if we play
again. We beat Guilford, but we

“He’s really been a great as-

had a really good game against
Virginia Wesleyan... we are
building on our games and'start-
ing to click as a team.”

On Saturday the Generals
faced the Hampden-Sydney Ti-
gers. Hampden-Sydney jumped
to a 4-1 lead over the Generals.
The Tigers held that lead to the
end of the fourth quarter when the
Generals came within two goals.

Freshman Tim Skeen led the
Generals with four goals, two of
which came off assists from ju-
nior midﬁelder Charlie Clarke.

Yet that wasn’t enough against
the Tigers, who were led by
Thomas Jennings and Eamon
Thorton.

The pair scored three goals
each. -

“We didn’t shoot very well,
and we didn’t handle pressure
well. We didn’t take enough shots
and had a lot of unforced errors
which is not like us,” said junior
attacker Grant Martin.

The Generals took 33 shots
which is the least amount taken
since the 29 they took against
Franklin and Marshall on March
19.

An overworked defense may
be one reason for the General’s
loss.

The Tigers’ goalie made 13
saves compared to Generals goal-

ie Chris Lalli, who had four.

“We didn’t play well in the ﬁrst
half at all so our defense played
the whole half which really wore
them out," said Rider

Rider ﬁnished the contest with
a goal and an assist.

“I don’t think we came ready
to play, and I don’t know why.

We didn’t play anywhere near our
best lax,” said senior midﬁelder
and captain Perrin Monroe.

The Generals will continue
their season Tuesday in the Lee-
Jackson Lacrosse Classic. They
will play Virginia Military Insti-
tute under the lights at 7:30 p.m.

THE RING-TUM PHI 0 7

Team looks forward to tourney

Continued from Page 8

hit it in his last home game at
W&L.

Also in that game, the Gener-
als committed six errors.

Two were charged to left-
ﬁelder Madden, three to second
baseman David Miller, and one
to senior Gosselink.

“That happens,” Stickley
said. ~

“You just hope it doesn’t
snowball.”

He pointed out that he was
glad the team was able to “stop
the bleeding,” and still play a
close game.

Meanwhile, catcher Wesley
suffered an injury in the bottom
of the ﬁfth inning and was taken
out of the game.

Stickley said Wesley had
pulled a muscle in his back or
chest, and though they were not
sure of the culprit, they did not
want to take any chances.

After the game, however,
Wesley said he was feeling bet-
ter.

Wesley, who has caught all
but a few innings this year, will
likely remain behind the plate for
the rest of the season.

“Calling a majority of the
games is tough,” Stickley said,
“but he’s done a great job.”

Assistant coach Eric Brookes
pointed out that Wesley has done
a lot of hard work, especially in
the recent high temperatures.

He talked about a game two
weeks ago when Wesley caught
19 innings in 85-degree tempera-
tures.

“That is asking a lot out of a
young kid,” he said, but added
that he thinks the catcher can
handle the rest of the season.

Even when doing a job his
head coach calls “physically and
mentally tough,” Wesley has
conﬁdence in himself.

“Even if I break a ﬁnger, I’ll
still tough it out,” he said.

Brookes explained that Wes-
ley has played so much this sea-
son based on his experience in
the past two years as a hitter and
backup catcher. ‘

He added that Dan Harris and
Chris Bolger, the two backup
catchers, have improved a great
deal throughout this season.

“We feel a lot better about the
backup situation,” he said.

Harris came into the game
when Wesley was taken out.
Stickley said he performed well,
hitting a single in the sixth in-
ning, and catching a foul bunt off
the bat of Daniel Mullins in the

eighth.

“He did a nice job,” Stickley
said.

Harris also ﬁlled in when
Stickley gave Wesley time to rest
during Tuesday’s non—conference
loss against West Virginia Tech.

Another player in need of rest
is ﬁrst baseman McConnell, who
has battled a back injury all sea-
son.

He was given a break when
coaches sent in freshman Andrew
Henderson at the end of Tuesday’s
game.

Stickley said that the coaches
were “really on edge” about Mc-
Connell’s back.

“We want to try to cut down on
the chances that he could hurt it,”
he said.

But the coaches do not want
to take McConnell out in the last
few games of his college career.

Brookes said, “We just try to
take it easy with him.”

Without two of their key start-
ers, the team did not perform well
on Tuesday, losing 11-0.

The coaches pointed out that
the loss was not because of the
backup players.

Brookes called it “one of
the few times this year when
we weren’t ready to play and it
showed.”

Stickley agreed.

“I was not pleased with that
effort,” he said, “and the guys
weren’t either.”

Stickley said that the men
lacked “mental preparedness” for
the game, in part because it was
played during the week.

He added, though, that he ex-
pects the team to bounce back.

“I’m sure we’ll respond well,”
he said.

Brookes agreed that the team
is ready to move on from Tues-
day’s loss.

“That’s behind us and hope-
fully the guys learned from it,”
he said.

Looking forward to the con-
ference tournament Thursday, the
team seems pretty conﬁdent.

The men play Bridgewater in
the opening round of the tourna-
ment.

They lost two heartbreaking
games to Bridgewater earlier this
year, each by only one run.

In the March 28 game, the
men were making a comeback in
the seventh inning when the game
was called because of darkness.

Despite the history, the Gen-
erals do not seem intimidated by
their opponents.

Gosselink said he is unafraid
of playing the top-ranked team in

doing the shuffle:

When Edwards pitches, the Generals make quite a few changes. To ﬁll his
place at third, Ray Sweeney moves over. He is replaced by Gosselink, who has
played short for W&L In the past. Miller comes in from left to play second.
Madden moves from rightfield to left, and is replaced by freshman Terrence
McKeIvey, who has made regular rounds in the batting order this season. ‘‘All of
them can play their positions,” Stickley said. “lt’s not really that big a deal.”

the conference.

“We can beat any team in this
tournament,” he said.

Teammate Wesley agreed.

“Overall, I’m not worried
about the tournament. Every year,
we come to play,” he said.

Though the games were close
today, he said Randolph-Macon
would not be a concern.

“They are not going to do any
damage in the tournament,” he
said.

He pointed out that last ‘year,
W&L was in a similar situation to
Randolph-Macon’s.

“No one expected us to do that
well, but we got hot in the middle
of the season,” he said.

The Generals beat three teams
in the ODACs last year, making it
all the way to the third day of the
tournament.

Wesley said that the team this
year is even better than last.

“We’re deeper this year,” he
said. “It’s just a matter of who is
going to step up.”

Hedrick said that his team fac-
es the same challenge.

“Our biggest handicap has
been our pitching,” he said.

Despite having one of the best
pitchers in the state, Randolph-
Macon’s other pitchers have not
been as consistent, he said.

He added that pitching would
make the dilference in how far

Randolph-Macon goes in the
tournament.

Gosselink said that because
this is not his ﬁrst time at the
tournament, he is not expecting to
play two games and go home.

But it is exactly that lack of
experience which has fueled
Randolph-Macon to the momen-
tum they have reached going into
Thursday’s tournament.

“It’s kind of a big deal for us,”
Hedrick said.

“I don’t think anyone expected
us to do as well as we have.”

Thursday should be an excit-
ing day for the Generals as well.

“We’re going to win the damn
thing,” Gosselink said.

Women 3 sports

' dominate, while
men is athletics
are slipping

By Tim Llvlngston
SPORTS EDITOR

The 2005-2006 season has
been an extremely successful
one for Washington and Lee.
With the success of this year’s
sports teams, many onlookers
question where the ’05—’06
season ranks among the best
in W&L history.

If this season is truly
the most prestigious in our
school’s history, it can be at-
tributed to the women.

The football team was one
heartbreaking loss away from
the ODAC championship,
men’s swimming ended the
season ranked fourteenth in
the country, and baseball, la-
crosse, men’s tennis and soc-
cer remain strong programs.

Who cares?

When W&L allowed wom-
en to attend our ﬁne institu-
tion, who would have thought
that they would pave the way
in athletics?

Who would have believed
that they would embarass
almost all men’s sports in
2006?

Perhaps this statistic will
help all the non—believers to
comprehend how thoroughly
women have dominated the
ODAC this season.

Does anyone have any idea
how many games the wom-
en’s volleyball, tennis, soccer,
swimming, lacrosse and ﬁeld
hockey teams have lost in the
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference this season?

The answer is one. One
game. The culprit for the only
loss was the girl’s ﬁeld hock-
ey team, who dropped a game
to Virginia Wesleyan, but later
won the ODAC and advanced
all the way to the NCAA tour-
ney.

What is the reason for the
success of our women? Who
knows.

Of course, Hampden—Syd—
ney must be feeling pretty
foolish for their decision to
shun the temptation of going
co—ed.

The truth remains that be-
cause they started less than
20 years-ago, none of our
women’s sports have a rich
tradition.

Nonetheless, our women’s
tennis team is the top team
in Division III, and our ﬁeld
hockey team, volleyball team
and lacrosse team are all na-
tionally ranked.

Moreover, these programs
continue to recruit and obtain
talent from around the coun-
try to bolster theit rosters. In
other words, women’s sports
at W&L show no signs of de-
cline in the near future.

Ironically, the ﬁelds that
were once conﬁned to only
the male persuasion are now
owned by the opposite sex.

As the girls continue to
thrive in the athletic realm,
one can only speculate how
the men will compete in the
future.

The truth remains that as
the women flourish, the men
are slipping. Guys, its time to
regroup. Robert E. Lee must
be spinning in his grave.

 

  

s ortsbriefs

Riding

Washington and Lee
claimed its ﬁrst ever ODAC
championship in riding on
Friday. The Generals posted
19 team points to defeat
defending champion Bridge-
water. Senior Caitlin Lane

Baseball

W&L split with rival Ran-
dolph Macon (8-7, 6-7) to
ﬁnish the ODAC with a 10-8

the ﬁnal frame to give the
Generals the 8-7 win. Work-
ing in relief, sophomore Jeﬁ°
Pharis earned his ﬁrst career
win after pitching effectively
for the Generals throughout
the season.

Women's Lacrosse

A goal by Christine Bender
with less than 5 minutes
remaining in regulation led
the women’s lax team to

a 9-8 victory over confer-
ence foe Virginia Wesleyan
on Saturday. The win was
important for the Generals
who claimed the number
one seed in the ODAC tour-
nament with the victory.
Sophomore Megan Slosson
also was a key contributor
and scored two consecutive
goals to bring the Generals
back from a 7-5 deﬁcit.

Men’s Lacrosse

The Generals fell 11-8 to
Hampden-Sydney on Satur-
day, dropping them to 2-3 in

man Tim Skeen led the
Generals with 4 goals while
sophomore Will Englehart
added 2 more.

Golf

The Generals split with Randolph-Macon in close games to end regular season

W&L lost many
close decisions in the
ODAC this season,
biutihope to reverse
their fortunes in the
tournament

By Katherine Greene
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF

When the baseball double-
header against Randolph-Macon
was rescheduled from Saturday
to Sunday due to rain, both teams
started to worry about their chanc-
es in the ODAC tournament.

The games, which determined
the Generals’ sixth-place standing
in the tournament, were not other-
wise important.

But come Thursday, it is going
to affect both teams’ pitching.

Both teams planned to start
their best pitchers Saturday.

Now, they are concerned that
the men will not have enough rest
before the tournament begins on
Thursday.

Randolph-Macon coach Ray
Hedrick said he is worried about
Travis Beazley, his star pitcher.

“It’s deﬁnitely going to affect

our pitching,” he said, but pointed ’ "

out that there was no alternative.

Catcher Jordan Wesley said
that the teams have the same is-
sue.
“Pitching is the biggest key to
surviving in the tournament,” he
said.

The Generals have had a fairly
good showing this year despite
a recent slump. The success, in
part, has been attributed to pitcher
Clayton Edwards.

At the end of the regular sea-
son, Edwards carried a team-high

6/wins with a 4.06 ERA.

But Beazley, in comparison,
had 8 wins and only a 1.77 ERA.

According to Generals head
coach Jelf Stickley, Randolph-
Macon has “probably the best
pitcher in the league.”

Despite this claim, Beazley
allowed the tying and winning
home rims in the ﬁnal inning of
the ﬁrst game.

The two runs were hit by se-
nior Taylor McConnell and soph-
omore slugger James Madden. It
was Madden’s seventh home run

this year.

Beazley started against Wash-
ington and Lee a year ago, but suf-
fered an embarrassing loss 22-l.

Shortstop Scott Gosselink
pointed out that last year’s loss
may have been an issue for the
Randolph-Macon pitcher.

“We hit him incredibly hard
last year,” Gosselink said, and
added that Beazley may have
been working out of a “need for
vengeance.”

Stickley said that Beazley had
vastly improved from that game.

“He’s a different player this
year,” Stickley said.

Hedrick agreed, saying he felt
lucky in his second year of coach-
ing at Randolph-Macon to have
such a solid player.

“I couldn’t ask for more,” he
said.

Hedrick compared Beazley to
W&L’s Edwards, saying that they
are both dynamic and talented
players.

Both pitchers also play third
base while not on the mound in
order to stay in the batting order.

In the fourth inning, senior

In retaliation, Mackenzie hom-

He said he feels “nostalgic”

Eight girls.

Nine perfect matches.

An undefeated season.

These ingredients fused as the
women’s tennis team swept its
competition at Guilford College
last weekend emerging victorious
in its fourth consecutive ODAC
tournament.

The Generals racked up a
hefty total of 99 points, followed
by Emory and Henry with 72 and
Hollins with 70.

Juniors Emily Applegate and
Katie Kingsbury represented the
team earning ODAC Player of the
Year and ODAC Scholar-Athlete
of the Year, respectively.

Applegate currently holds the
number one spot on the team, and
has maintained a ﬂawless record
this year. Though Kingsbury did

a really strong
team this year,” Kingsbury said.
“We have the talent. We have the
drive. Especially this year, there
are so many girls who believe
they can win.”

Not only did the Generals win
the ODAC tournament, but they
shut out every opponent, securing
victory in every set. .

“Winning all nine ﬂights was

a good way to start our post-
season,” junior Ginny Wortham
said.

Sweeping the six singles’
ﬂights were Applegate, freshman
Katie Tabb, Wortham, sopho-
more Leah Weston, freshman Tori
Christmas and sophomore Kelly
Will respectively.

Tabb and Wortham captured
ﬁrst in the number one doubles’
ﬂight, followed by an identical
ﬁrst place performance by Weston
and senior, captain Lisa Mabry.
Applegate and sophomore Rebec-
ca Timmis dominated their com-
petition to place ﬁrst as well in the
number three doubles ﬂight.

“We didn’t drop a set,” Mabry ,

said. “We’ve had a lot of the
younger girls do a really good
job. I think that we‘re as close as
ever, and that’s what makes us so
strong.”

Currently ranked ﬁrst in the na-
tion by the Intercollegiate Tennis
Association, the Generals await
an oﬂicial invitation to Nationals.

- If they win the ﬁrst two rounds,

defeating teams within their re-
gion, the girls will proceed to
California for the ﬁnal matches.

According to the ITA Division
III National Rankings, Trinity
University, Sewanee, Claremont-
Mudd-Scripps College and Emo-
ry University occupy the second
through ﬁfth spots.

According to head coach Cin-
da Rankin, the team has been fo-
cusing on the match at hand.

“I think that helps us keep ev-
erything in the present,” she said.
“Once we ﬁnish with this, we look

on to the next one. [The girls] are
deﬁnitely buying into that. They
are willing take that type of ap-
proach.”

Last year, W&L contended for
the number one spot at Nationals
with rival Emory. In the ﬁnals,
they were defeated 5-3, ending
with second place ﬁnish.

“Basically, whenever Emory
is in a National Championship
ﬁnal, they bring another level
that you’ve never seen before,”
Wortham said. “I think that I,
personally, was not as prepared
for the moment as I should have
been. But, it’s a new year, and we
are focusing on what we can do
this year. You can’t do anything
about the past.”

The team has spent time this
year analyzing its mistakes and
preparing both mentally and
physically for the competition
this season.

“We’ve really focused on one
match at a time, and we haven’t
really thought about Nationals

 

and getting there and how far
we’re going to get,” Mabry said.
“Whether that’s the next ODAC
match, or whether it is the next
big match against Sewanee next
weekend, we really have to work
hard now, because that’s all that
we can control.”

April 16, the Generals de-
feated Emory at an Invitational in
Atlanta.

“It was so exciting,” Tabb said.
“It was the ﬁrst time in four years
to ﬁnally beat them.”

According to Rankin, the
goal for each girl is to play every
match with the intensity as though
it were the most important.

“Sometimes you want it so
much that you psych yourself
out,” Tabb said. “You want to win
something in particular so much
that you have trouble perform-
ing. It’s hard to focus and make
it seem like just another match-
something you’ve done the whole
season.”

During Spring Break, the team
underwent high intensity training
in preparation for ODACs and po-
tential post-season competition.

“It was probably one of the
hardest weeks that I’ve ever been
through in my tennis career,”
Tabb said. “It really paid off. We
did really well at our Emory Invi-
tational.”

As the time before Nationals
approaches, Rankin will cater
more towards the speciﬁc needs
of each athlete.

“You have to work as individ-
uals to make the strongest team,”
she said. “We will be tailoring all

of the practices to the individu-
als.”

According to Weston, the per-
sonalities on the team contribute
to its broad success.

“We’re deﬁnitely a tight-knit
group,” she said. “Overall, we
had an amazing team last year,
but this year, I think our team is
just as strong, maybe stronger.”

Kingsbury said the work ethic
also strengthens the team.

“We all try hard in practice,”
she said. “Everyone brings 100
percent. I think that’s why we
are deep. Everyone motivates
each other and themselves con-
stantly.”

According to Kingsbury,
assistant coach Curt Speersch-
neider designs a theme for each
season. This year, the motto is
“trust”.

“It can mean a number of
things,” Kingsbury said. “Trust
your own abilities. Trust your
teammates abilities. Trust that
you can win.”

May 6 and 7 mark the ﬁrst
two rounds of Nationals with the
location pending. The following
rounds of team Nationals will be
held in Santa Cruz, California
beginning May 17.

Individual Nationals will take
place at the same location start-
ing May 20. Individual athletes
will receive bids on May 1.

“We know we can perform,”
Tabb said. ‘‘I think that’s our
main strength in winning and
competing well.”

The Phi will return to news-
tands on Monday, May 15 with
our penultimate issue of the
2005-2006 school year.

Lexington resident and certi-
ﬂed scuba diver Charles Volpe
drowned at Jordan’s Point last
week. He is the fourth person to
drown at that spot on the Maury
River since 2003.

Volpe, a 16-year-old sopho-
more at Rockbridge County High
School, was swimming upriver of
the darn around 4 p.m. on Sunday,
April 23 when he and Bryc Talley,
a friend who was with him, were
both swept over the dam. Talley
was able to escape the dam’s un-
dercurrent, but Volpe was pinned
under the surface by the force of
the water.

Lt. Steve Crowder of the Lex-
ington Police Department refuted
rumors that the boys had been
playing on the top of the dam.

“After speaking with witness-
es who were on the scene, I’m
adamantly convinced they were
swimming upstream and were
washed over the dam.”

Crowder, who coordinates di-
saster management for the Lex-
ington police, was called just
after 4 p.m. and told Volpe had
drowned. The officer immediate-
ly called Virginia’s Department of
Emergency Management, which
provides logistical support — div-
ers, helicopters, Red Cross assis-
tance — to local departments.

“The local divers were there
pretty fast,” Crowder said. “The
State Police called and couldn’t
initially provide support, but they
worked out some details and were
able to come with a helicopter in
about 35 minutes, which is excel-
lent response time.”

The Rockbridge Country
Sherilf’s oﬂice has two divers,
and there is a Swiﬁ Water Res-
cue group based in Buena Vista.
Crowder also said divers from
WestVaCo, a paper company,
came over from Covington, Va. to
assist the search teams.

Volpe’s body was discovered

just below the dam by a cadaver
dog from the Blue and Gray
Search Dog Company. The group
works with the state’s emergency
management department. Divers
from the Augusta Country Sher-
iff’s Department were then able
to ﬁnd the body underwater. The
search took nearly 24 hours.
According to his obituary,
Volpe was a member of the high
school’s jazz band and tennis
team. He also held seven certiﬁ-
cations from the National Associ-
ation of Underwater Instructors, a

group that certiﬁes scuba divers.

School names women deans

Female students and faculty say school must still do more

By Jessica Shaw
STAFF WRITER

On July 1, newly appointed
Deans Janet lkecla and Elizabeth
Knapp will join an all-male ad-
ministration in Washington Hall.

The announced resignation of
Dean Ellen Mayock on Feb. 28
marked the departure of the only
female member of the academic
administration. In the controver-
sy surrounding her resignation,
many faculty members and stu-
dents have taken a stand in clear
contention with the lack of diver-
sity in the administration.

“I think it’s subtle. It teaches
male and female students that
there’s something unusual about
women who want to be in charge,”
Associate Professor of Politics
Robin Leblanc said. “It can often
cast a negative light on ambitious
women on any level.”

Leblanc is only one of the fac-
ulty members challenging this
situation.

In the 24 hours following
Mayock’s announced resignation,
junior Paten Hughes compiled a
petition containing 311 signatures
protesting the lack of women in
the academic administration.

“I didn’t know what else do,

and I wanted there to be a way
to voice my concern, my friends’
concern, other students’ concern,”
Hughes said.

Even with the addition of
Ikeda and Knapp, the school’s ef-
forts to reach gender equilibrium
among students since 1985 are
not reﬂected in the diversity of its
academic administrators. Many
faculty and students view this as a
problem on several levels.

“I feel like it’s hard as a wom-
an on this campus to feel like I
can be successful where I don’t
see women being promoted, and
I don’t see their successes being
honored,” Hughes said. “Without
women in these positions, how
can we feel like we belong in
those positions?”

There are other concerns with
the shortage of women in posi-
tions of power. According to
Mayock, many young women
seek her out for advice regarding
sexual abuse and other private
matters. She said that being the
sole female this year was tough
because there was no other outlet
for guidance.

Mayock also added that as the
solitary female voice in meetings
and decision-making, it was easy
for her expression to be muffled.

“It has become very clear to me
that if you have only one or two
[women], the voice is not heard,”
she said. “You need more women
at the table. I do not believe that
our administration purposefully
ignores women, [but] if it’s only
one woman, it’s a tough road.”

Functioning in the academic
administration for two full years,
Mayock said she noticed some
subtleties in male behavior. She
said men tended to ask about her
children repeatedly, offer hugs
instead of handshakes and un-
dermine her decisions carried out
with the proper authority.

“For every behavior, I under-
stand the genesis of the behavior,
and I truly believe that it’s out of
a desire for human contact. How-
ever, the reality of this type of be-
havior creates a huge obstacle for
women.”

Because the presence of men
is so dominant, Leblanc said they
are not forced to interact with
women regularly, and therefore
lack some of the skills necessary
to maintain a professional rela-
tionship.

“Professional women have
to work with men. They learn to

towns or factory complexes, but
many do not ﬁll those functions
any longer.

“The dam serves no purpose
that I know of,” City Manager
Tim Ellestad said. “There are a
lot of dams on the Maury. They
dammed the river to allow barg-
es to go up river. Jordan’s Point
used to be Lexington’s industrial
center.”

Low rise dams can be as tall as
25 feet or as small as six inches,
according to the Miami (Ohio)
Conservatory District. The dams,

because of their low height, ap-
pear harmless, but dangerous cur-
rents below the dam can easily
trap swimmers.

“The area below the dam is
particularly diﬂicult to deal with
because of cascading, swirling
water,” Ellestad said.

Ellestad and Crowder both
said the area has sufﬁcient re-
sources to deal with disasters of
this nature.

“In a rural area it’s particularly

Here ’s the latest up-
date on who ran afoul
of the law during the
last few weeks. We
took a peek at this

to see what you ’ve

been up to...

Pit bulls run amok
Local resident Thomas
Sloan, Jr. was charged with
allowing a pit bull to run

at large. The charge was
issued at 8:25 a.m. on Fri-
day, April 14. He was also
charged with not having a
rabies vaccine for the dog or
a city dog license.

Yet another DUI
Joseph West, a resident of

Midlothian, Virginia, was
charged with a DUI on
Thursday, April 20. He was
stopped at 1 a.m. and also
charged with failure to obey
a highway sign.

Do the cops have a
quota or something?

Michael Trani was arrested
on Sunday, April 9 and
charged with public drunk-
enness. Trani, a Covington,
Virginia resident, was ar-
rested around 11:15 p.m.

Wild and reckless
Caroline Beda was charged
with a variety of traﬁic of-

Police prowl Foxﬁelds

Oﬁicers crack down on underage drinking as college students turn out in droves

By Sarah Kientz
STAFF WRITER

Increased security at the Fox-
ﬁeld horse races on Saturday re-
sulted in a more controlled event,
police said.

Lieutenant John Teixeira of
the Albemarle County Police De-
partment said the department’s
goal was to “create a safer atmo-
sphere” at Foxﬂeld.

The police increased their
ranks from 50 to 250 ofﬁcers pres-
ent at the event, Teixeira said.

“In the past several years we
have not been on the inside, but
this year we took over the interior
ground,” Teixeira said, referring
to the area within the circular
horse track where most students
spend time.

Teixeira estimated that there
were 20,000 people at Foxﬂeld,
70 percent of which were college
students.

The increased security mea-
sures were intended to keep stu-
dents in line.

“In recent years there has been
a dramatic increase in the amount
of disorderly conduct, ﬁghts and
indecent exposure,” Teixeira said.
“It was really getting out of hand
and that’s why we increased the
number of ofﬁcers.”

Before the event, the Albe-
marle County Police and Virginia
State Police distributed green ﬂi-
ers throughout Washington and
Lee’s campus, warning that “po-
lice will be observing patrons
upon their arrival by chartered
buses and in their personal ve-
hicles. Patrons entering the race
will be monitored for intoxication
and legal age requirements, and
those found to be violating the
law while entering the event will
not gain admittance.”

Sophomore Kathy Garman
said she saw those threats in ac-
tion upon arriving at the ﬁeld.

“Within the ﬁrst 20 minutes of
being at Foxﬁelds I saw at least
four people being taken away by
cops right as we walked in,” Gar-
man said. “There were bike cops
riding through trafﬁc looking for
open containers and security at
the gate when you walked in was
checking bags.”

Although over 100 arrests
were made at the event, Teixeira
said he felt the heightened secu-
rity achieved its goal.

“The number of ﬁghts and dis-
orderly conduct dropped dramati-
cally,” Teixeira said. “A majority
of students had a good time and
acted appropriately, but unfortu-
nately there was still that minor-
ity who thinks it’s a place to get
drunk and get out of hand.”

Teixeira added that only one

Students drink and socialize during the Foxﬂeld races.

W&L student was arrested at Fox-
ﬁelds and charged with underage
possession of alcohol.

The student was released on
summons.

The arrested student did not
respond to multiple requests for
comment.

Freshman Tommy Pignatelli
said he was upset that the W&L
student was arrested though be-
having responsibly.

Pignatelli said there was more
outrageous behavior throughout
the event.

“A lot of people didn’t really
watch the horses. Most people
just sat around, ate and drank,”
Pignatelli said. “There were a lot
of drunk people making out with
each other and throwing up.”

Meanwhile, Garman, who at-
tended the event last year as well,
said she felt students acted more
appropriately this year at Foxﬁeld

because of the increased number
of police.

“In some respects people toned
it down from last year,” Garman
said. “People were still drinking,
but it was in moderation. There
were less people being belligerent
and falling down drunk.”

Garman also said she had
more ﬁm at this event because
there was less drinking than the
year before.

She said, “I had more fun this
year because people were not
quite as ridiculous and you didn’t
have to worry about taking care of
people as much.”

Pignatelli, however, said that
he felt the event was only fun for
those who were drinking.

“I thought it was boring,” he
said, “but that could have been
because I was a sober driver.”

Junior Kelly Price said the
behavior seen at past events war-

Phto cortsey of Sarah Kientz

ranted increased security and that
the added officials will make the
event safer in the future.

“They’ve had problems in the
past with underage drinking, and
having more security at the event
is a good idea,” Price said. “Hav-
ing more police there will make
it safer.”

Heightened security will de-
crease drinking at Foxﬁeld next
year, Price said, “because inevita-
bly people are going to be getting
in trouble.”

Teixeira also said he hoped
that this year’s law enforcement
at Foxﬂeld will set an example
and act as a warning for students
in years to come.

A change in behavior, Price
said, “depends on whether or not
people take the threat of increased
security seriously and realize there
is a real chance that people drink-
ing underage will be arrested.”

The high brought low
On April 21 Max Sandler
was formally charged with
possession of marijuana.
Sandler originally ran into
trouble on Jan. 7, when
Lexington Police officers
entered a room he was in
around 1:20 a.m. The of-
ﬁcers had been advised of a
complaint that people were
smoking marijuana in the
room, and, alter informing
W&L security oﬂicers of
the complaint, the police
entered the room. Police
Chief Bruce Beard said three
bongs were in plain sight on
a table. The three month de-
lay in ﬁling charges occurred
because the bongs were sent
to a crime lab for testing.

Jefferson Street jaunt
Natalie Mackie, age 47, was
arrested on April 18 and

charged with being drunk in
public. Officer Fred Smith saw
Mackie, a native of Smithﬁeld,
Virginia, walking on Jefferson
Street. The ofﬁcer said Mackie
was showing signs of public
intoxication.

Don't make them visit
twice

Adam Thomas Lotts was
charged with simple assault

on April 19. Ofﬁcers reported
to 525 Maury Street after a
woman called and said Lotts
had grabbed her around the
neck and forced her arm behind
her back, dragging her towards
the house. The woman also
complained that Lotts was
drunk. The oﬂicers left the
scene and went to obtain a war-
rant, but shortly after they left
the woman called to say Lotts
had become violent again. The
officers returned to the house
after the woman’s second call.

think men are like them.
But some men, especially
the senior men at this institu-
tion, have not been forced in
the same way to experience
women as like them,” she
said.

Leblanc said W&L oﬁen
runs into difﬁculties recruit-
ing women in part due to its
geographic location. Lexing-
ton may not offer an appeal-
ing environment for single
women or those trying to
raise children. It also may not
provide decent jobs for both
spouses in a marriage situa-
tion.

“Recruiting single males
or females can present a chal-
lenge to a small, rural com-
munity,” Acting President
Harlan Beckley said.

Much of this year was ded-
icated to celebrating women
for their 20-year legacy on
this campus.

Mayock, as the sole fe-
male academic dean, played a
large role in organizing these
events, planning speakers and
designing a calendar.

“The positive feedback
has come from men in older
classes, some of whom didn’t
favor the concept of co-edu-
cation, but have been pleased
by the positive results.”

Such events took months
of planning and dedication.
As a woman in the adminis-
tration, Mayock could devote
a lot of her time to issues that
may be overlooked by her
male counterparts.

Because of the image she
upheld, many faculty mem-
bers were greatly affected by
her resignation.

LeBlanc said, “When
Mayock was ‘encouraged’ to
step down, it just made me
feel lesser.”

LeBlanc said that she had
a day when she was embar-
rassed in front of her students,
because she said they had
seen “that the women were
in leadership roles and they
could be thrust aside with
ease. I thought my students
would see me as a second-rate
member of the faculty.”

Sometime this month,
Hughes will present a revised

Campus Women

version of her petition to the
Board of Trustees. "

“I think the biggest prob-
lem with regard to gender re-
lations on our campus is that
we don’t view it as a prob-
lem,” she said.

Alumnus Chris Wood
(’89) has been in correspon-
dence with the administration
concerning his displeasure
with the hype of Celebrating
Women.

In his letter, however,
Wood claims he certainly em-
braces the presence of wom-
en. He merely disapproves
of their isolation by means
of celebration, and said that
many alumni agree.

“In my opinion, it is much
more important to have the -
right people in the position,
whatever [race or sex] they
may be,” he said.

Ikeda said she feels more
conﬁdent having women pre-
decessors who have paved the
road for her.

As associate dean, she said
a huge role she will be fulﬁll-
ing is that of a listener.

“What is important to me
is not only bringing the per-
spectives of women to the
table, but also to tap into
more diverse viewpoints rep-
resented on campus for men
and women,” she said.

Despite the controversy,
Mayock said she is pleased
with the overall progress of
W&L through the nine years
she has been on campus.

“I have seen a lot of prog-
ress. I’ve been here a full nine
years. I credit hiring more
women, the women’s studies
program and bringing the en-
rollment of men and women
to parity.”

Beckley is optimistic in
terms of increasing women in
the administration.

“It’s my belief that the
W&L administration, as it
seeks a new Provost and new
deans within the next few
years will do everything [it]
can to recruit qualiﬁed fe-
males and do everything [it]
can to make them feel wel-
come,” he said.

“I anticipate we will have
a woman in one or more of
these positions in four to ﬁve
years or earlier.”

Sewing up controversy

Bizzare Kathekon interviews raise questions about alumni intent

By Jacob Geiger and
Jesslca Shaw
NEWS EDITOR AND STAFF WRITER

Students are raising questions
about the tactics used in Kathek-
on interviews.

According to several students
who went through the process a
few weeks ago, these were not or-
dinary interviews.

“It’s people that come into a
room, and you get asked some
goofy questions,” Kathekon mem-
ber Walker Williams said. “Some
questions are geared towards how
you would act around alumni,
how much you know about the
school and how much you care
about the school.”

Some applicants said they
knew that these interviews would
be unusual while others said they
were caught off guard.

“It’s not testing what you think
you’re going to be interviewed
about,” a new member said.

One applicant, who asked to
remain anonymous, described her
interview.

“I was standing on a stool danc-
ing, and I had to seduce a copy
machine. I wasn’t uncomfortable,
but I could see how it would make
others uncomfortable.”

The applicant said the inter-
view was designed to be intimi-
dating.

“This guy pretended to be a
drunk alum, and I had to sit in his
lap, and I had to say how I would
make him happy.”

Tripp Onnen, advisor to Kath-
ekon, said the the interviews are
designed to measure a candidate’s
ability to handle tough questions
from alumni.

“You get the odd question
about co-education or the speak-
ing tradition,” Onnen said. “You
get questions from people who
haven’t been back in ﬁve years or
haven’t been back in 20 years and
say ‘show me what’s new.’”

When asked about the anony-
mous students’ statements, On-
nen said he found the applicants’
statements “a little surprising.”

“I can’t speak to that,” he said.
“I did my best to monitor those
interviews.”

Kathekon President Olivia
Mansﬁeld said she tailored her
questions to each individual.

“I’d only ask silly questions
to someone I knew,” she said. “I
wouldn’t ask people if I didn’t
know them or what they were
comfortable with; it comes back
to the all important situations you
ﬁnd yourself in. You have to be
diplomatic and responsible.”

Many new members declined
to answer any questions about the
process.

“They told us we weren’t al-

difficult to have resources there
quickly,” Ellestad said.

“In a normal situation with the
river we have some good local re-
sources, but none of that mattered
in this situation,” he said.

“If there was a rescue squad ﬁve
minutes away it wouldn’t have
mattered because the boy was
dead just a few minutes after he
went over the dam.”

In July of 2003 a local ﬁsher-
man also drowned in the Maury
River near J ordan’s Point.

Two local children drowned
upstream of the dam in August of
2004 after jumping out of a tree
into the river.

Despite these incidents, there
are no signs around Jordan’s Point
warning swimmers of the danger
the dam poses.

Crowder estimated the current
was ﬂowing at 12 knots when the
boys jumped into the water.

He also estimated that the wa-
ter was as "much as ten ‘feet deep
directly underneath the dam.

“The only signs up,” Lt.
Crowder said, “are what the city
put up to prohibit people from
jumping out of that tree the two
kids jumped out of.”

Crowder said the tree the two
boys jumped out of in 2004 is lo-
cated on the river’s north bank.

The tree has branches that ex-
tend out over the river.

The park and playing ﬁelds at
Jordan’s Point are located on the
south bank.

“Water’s a wonderful rec-
reational resource,” Lexington
Vice Mayor Tim Golden said.
“If you have water people are go-
ing to get into it.” Golden said he
thought the City Council would
discuss the idea of putting up
signs.

“No, we don’t have any signs
up there,” Ellestad said. “I’d
anticipate this will be a point of
discussion.”

the interviews,” new member
Kelly Harvey said. “Tripp [On-
nen] said to refer all questions to
him.”

member Ted Williams said.
Though some of the appli-
cants were uncomfortable with
the process, most of them agreed
that Kathekon is different from

Harvey said these
instuctions were deliv-
ered at a meeting after
the interview process
was complete.

Mansﬁeld said
Kathekon was like
most organizations
on campus wanting to
maintain conﬁdential-
ity with its interviews.
However, she said
that members were
not forbidden from talking about
their interview.

“No one has ever been told
‘don’t say anything ever, don’t
talk about Kathekon,’ she said.
“We’ve been on a big PR cam-
paign this year to educate people
on what Kathekon is. We had
Speak Day in the fall and are hav-
ing another one this spring.”

Mansﬁeld, Onnen and other
members stressed that the inter-
views try to gauge how students

would react in awkward situa-

tions with alumni.

“I do think that the interview
process is telling of how a can-
didate would perform under cer-
tain circumstances during Alumni
Weekend or Homecoming,” new

“This guy pretended to be a
drunk alum, and I had to sit in

“I would have never been put
in any of those situations with
an alum, but to some extent, it’s
necessary,” sophomore applicant
Betsy Chaplin said. “A regular
sit—down interview talking about
why you want to be in Kathekon
is not enough.”

Chaplin said she was prepared
for the interview and nothing
made her uncomfortable.

One student said she wondered
if the situations presented in inter-
views are realistic.

“I would be a little scandalized
if W&L alums were expecting the
behavior that was asked of the ap-
plicants in their interviews,” she
said.

board of Montgomery Bell
Academy since 1982 and was
chairman of that board from
1997 until 2005.

Both Gambill and Balentine
have plenty of business experi-
ence as well.

Gambill was the CEO and
president of Baird Electric
Company for 32 years.

“They have good business
acumen,” Norwood said, “and
the ﬁnancial side of the school
is really a big part of our respon-
sibility. A business background
is a plus but not a requirement
for board members.”

Balentine was chairman and
CEO of an investment consult-
ing company that he helped co-
found. The ﬁrm, which began
in 1987, was acquired by anoth-
er company in 2002.

“Balentine built and ran a
large business,” he said.

Balentine, who served as a
co-chair of the Mock Conven-
tion Planning Committee and
was a member of Phi Delta
Theta while at W&L, addressed
what he said were some of the
issues facing the board.

“One thing is completion
of the strategic plan that we’ve
been looking at the last few
years,” he said.

Balentine said he thinks new
President Ken Ruscio will be
heavily involved in the imple-
mentation of the plan.

“As the ﬁnishing touches are
put on, Ken will have his ﬁnger-
prints on [the plan],” Balentine
said.

Balentine also addressed
the role of the Greek system at
W&L the university.

“The Greek system has cer-
tainly been an integral part
of W&L... it will evolve and
change with the times.”

The majority of the members
of the board are alumni, Nor-
wood said, although it is not a
requirement.

“W&L has a wonderful
alumni network that shares a
common bond and culture” Bal-
entine said. “The friendships
and business relationships that
are formed are very important.
The fact that Ken is an alum-
nus and that alumni are so pas-
sionate will strengthen for the
school.”

When asked to recall a favor-
ite memory of the school, Bal-
entine picked one appropriate
for this time of year.

was at Mary Baldwin College

Admissions dean
clariﬁes statements

To the Editor:

Ordinarily I would not write
to address statements made by an
anonymous author.

I will in this case, however,
because the author, the Concerned
Parent, is known to me and has ap-
parently misunderstood my previ-
ous correspondence with him on
the topic of Washington and Lee’s
admission practices with respect
to legacies, athletes, minority stu-
dents and, indeed, all students. If
I was not misunderstood, then I
have been misrepresented. Either
way, I feel it important to com-
ment.

This winter the Concerned Par-
ent wrote me to question W&L’s
admission practices as they relate
to minority students. His query
included statements reﬂecting
his belief that minority students
admitted to W&L are less quali-
ﬁed than other students who gain
admission.

Further, he tried to bolster this
mistaken belief by citing a brief
conversation we had earlier that
fall, the same one he cites in the
Phi.

Whether he misunderstood our
conversation or sought to mis-

characterize my comments in his
query, I do not know, but his letter
to the Phi last week contains the
same inaccurate account of our
exchange.

This bothers me greatly, be-
cause I wrote him a personal letter
setting the record straight about
what I did and did not say and il-
lustrating that all students admit-
ted to W&L are qualiﬁed for that
distinction.

It appears my letter was too
subtle. Now that the innuendo-
laden statemen, “it is the only
way we can get them in,” has
been incorrectly attributed to me
a second time (and this time pub-
licly), I feel I must be more ex-
plicit: I never said that, nor did
Iimply it.

Further, I did not use the word
“preference” to describe our treat-
ment of any segment of W&L’s
applicant pool. That is his word,
not mine. Instead, I described
that our admission staff weighs
a variety of academic and per-
sonal qualities to decide which
students, among a large group
of well-qualiﬁed applicants, will
gain admission.

It appears the Concerned Par-

ent wishes to concentrate on SAT
scores, yet no college I know of
relies on scores as heavily as he
suggests W&L should.

Such an approach would cer-
tainly guarantee higher test scores
in our student body, among all
demographics, but it would also
ensure myriad unfulﬁlled enroll-
ment priorities and, most likely, a
dismal social environment lack-
ing the characteristic richness that
has made W&L a life-changing
experience for generations of stu-
dents.

Strong as W&L is, in my view
there is still room to improve it.
Each of us has a role to play in
that pursuit.

My own is to continue work-
ing to attract and enroll an ever
broader student population, one
that contains as wide a range of
talents, perspectives and aspira-
tions as possible. Every single
member of the W&L family has
a mark to leave, and every single
student admitted to W&L was
chosen because of their potential
to do so.

Jonathan A. Webster

Associate Dean of Admissions

To the Editor:

The letter from the Con-
cerned Parent that appeared in
the April 24 edition of the Ring-
tum Phi troubles me deeply be-
cause it implies that our African-
American and Hispanic students
are unqualiﬁed.

Additionally, the writer de-
mands evidence that will prove
his point. The Afn'can-Ameri-
can student population is both
hurt and insulted by the letter as
well they should be. This attack
on their academic ability is un-
fair and unwarranted.

The letter is also unfair to
Washington and Lee adminis-
trators and admissions officers
because it contends that they
are both unfair and devious.
More important, the letter tends
to drive a wedge into our com-
munity in an attempt to raise the
contentious issue of aﬂirmative
action as it casts aspersions on
both school policy and students.

I cannot pretend to have in-
side information on W&L ad-
missions policies because I do
not.

Yet, no one knows any better
than me how slowly racial prog-
ress came to southern colleges in
general and W&L in particular.

My earliest afﬁliation with
this university was in 1963 when
I was a few months shy of my
twentieth birthday. The only
places for African-Americans at
W&L in 1963 were dining ser-
vices and janitorial work. The
university did not recruit and ac-
cept its ﬁrst black student (since
John Chavis) until August 1966.
After one year he transferred
to a historically black college.
Forty years later we have only
78 black students in the under-
graduate population.

How can the writer allege
that their presence implies unfair

treatment for white students?

Frankly, I ﬁnd very little dif-
ference between the ability of
the white and black students I
teach. I have strong students
and poor students who belong to
both races.

Allow me to share a little of
my own academic history.

I became a full time W&L
student in 1983 at age 40. I had
graduated from a segregated
high school in 1961, and my SAT
scores were very old when I en-
tered. They were also irrelevant
because I had been a part time
W&L student for three years be-
ginning in 1980, and used those
courses to prove my ability.

I graduated in 1985 with a
GPA of 3.375 for which I make
no apologies.

During those years I was
husband, father, PTA president,
treasurer of the Rockbridge Re-
gional Library, secretary of the
Board of Elections, a member of
the Rockbridge Mental Health
Clinic Board, a member of St.
Patrick Catholic Church pastoral
council and a member of a host
of other organizations. Com-
munity service was dear to my
heart, and I studied hard.

W&L took a chance on me,
and I refuse to believe that my
own admission kept a single
more deserving white student
out of the college. Today I have
a Ph.D. and am a member of the
faculty.

I feel strongly about the

worthiness of every potential
student to earn a W&L degree.
And guess what! W&L has
never limited admission to SAT
scores and grade point aver-
ages——not even during the Jim
Crow Era. Would you want to
be a student at this university if
everyone was a study “geek?” If
W&L ever limits admissions to
academic achievement only, so-
cial life will drastically change.
Think about it!

I am also troubled that the
Ring-tum Phi does not share the
same policy as most profession-
al newspapers—not to publish
anonymous letters.

I have the moral courage
to own everything I write, and
others should do the same or
refrain from entering public fo-
rums. Unfortunately, the edi-
tors also bear responsibility for
anonymous letters and readers
can rightly assume that the Con-
cerned Parent’s views reﬂect
those of the Ring-tum Phi—as
much as I hope that is not true.
It is a university newspaper for
all members of the W&L com-
munity including Hispanic and
African American students.

Student responds to parent

Senior says admissions department should continue to look beyond test scores

To the Editor:

I am very concerned about
Washington and Lee University.

After four years of being a stu-
dent here, I am conﬁdent we have
made strides in the right direction
when it comes to diversity, multi-
culturalism and gender relations,
but it worries and saddens me to
read letters like the one sent by a
Concerned Parent to the Phi last
week.

Among other things, the parent
in question seems to believe it is
unfair that the Admissions Office
encourages minority students to
apply by offering them exclusive
incentives that are not offered to
majority candidates.

In my opinion, if there has
been a historical disparity in the
proportion of applications re-
ceived from particular groups (as
measured against their share of
the general population, or as mea-
sured against application numbers
at other comparable institutions)
then there is a presumption that
the school has not been marketing
itself to those groups. The Admis-
sions Oﬂice, therefore, is simply
making efforts to correct that his-
torical error. Please note that this
is a marketing effort; it is not the
same as actually admitting a stu-
dent simply because he or she is
a minority.

In fact, the parent her/him-
self quoted several admissions
ofﬁcers as saying that minority
students at W&L are as academi-
cally qualiﬁed as their major-

ity counterparts, and that race is
only considered when “separating
equals,” much like athletic ability
or legacy status would give an ap-
plicant an edge only when he or
she is as academically qualiﬁed as
the other students seeking admit-
tance.

Now, this parent seems to be-
lieve that minority students can-
not possibly be as academically
qualiﬁed as their counterparts
because, statistically, their SAT
scores are likely to be lower than
majority students’ scores. He or
she thinks that the admissions of-
ﬁce cannot possibly be “separat-
ing equals” when it is likely that
SAT scores for black students are
more than 100 points below SAT
scores for whites.

Sir or Madam, I hope you
understand that SAT scores and
even GPAs are not the deﬁnitive
yardstick by which we hope to
measure prospective students’
ability. Some students from dis-
advantaged backgrounds, from
marginalized communities or
from difiicult home circumstanc-
es have overcome obstacles that
students from more comfortable
backgrounds may never even
have imagined.

A reasonable case can be made
that a student who has come a
long way, overcoming numer-
ous obstacles and disadvantages,
but with slightly lower numbers,
is of equal or greater merit than
another student who has led an
entirely privileged life. A reason-

able case could similarly be made
that the disadvantaged student
has an equal or greater potential
to succeed at the school than a
privileged applicant with oth-
erwise slightly higher numbers.
Judgments of this sort are hard
to make, require great care and
beneﬁt from the lessons of expe-
rience

The admissions process should
be holistic, looking at the entire
candidate’s ﬁle in the context of
the incoming class as a whole.
It is an art; otherwise, machines
would do it.

It is the Admissions Ofﬁce’s

responsibility to admit an inter-

esting, thoughtful, diverse and
academically qualiﬁed incom-
ing class that will bring credit to
the school by its commitment to
learning, and, later, by its accom-
plishments in as wide a variety
of ﬁelds, endeavors and locales
as is possible. The class should
be as diverse as possible in every
way—along class, ethnic, racial,
national and geographic lines, as
well as in terms of the disciplin-
ary and extracurricular interests
that they are likely to bring to the
school.

By doing this, the Admissions
Office not only creates a more
interesting and educational envi-
romnent for current students, but
also increases the value of stu-
dents’ diplomas (if you want the
economic argument) by creating
future networking opportunities
and enhancing the school’s repu-

tation.There is another reason
why minority recruitment “is nec-
essary to enrich the educational
experience of all.”

W&L is both an academic in-
stitution and a community. The
greater the diversity of our stu-
dent body, the richer the environ-
ment in which students will ﬁnd
themselves as they grow into
adulthood.

For many, this will be the ﬁrst
time they encounter people very
much like themselves in some
ways (academic aptitude, commit-
ment to learning), but very differ-
ent from them in others, whether
it be in terms of ethnic, national,
cultural or religious backgrounds,
or of disciplinary or extracurricu-
lar interests.

I realize that this letter could
go on for pages, so I will stop
now and just say this: to suggest
that thereshould be an end to the
promotion of diversity at W&L,
to suggest that the careful con-
siderations of merit and promise
of each and every candidate be
cast aside, and that the growth in
geographic, social and disciplin-
my reach of W&L’s reputation
be stunted—all for the sake of
a few index numbers—is short-
sighted, extreme and certainly not
in the best interests of the school,
its student body or your son or
daughter.

Dean sets
record straight

To the Editor:

I would like to set the record
straight. All Washington and Lee
students are qualiﬁed to be here
or they would not have been ad-
mitted.

No concession in admissions
standards has been made to enroll
any students.

If one looks at all the elements

The overwhelming num-
ber of students at Wash-
ington and Lee with a
demonstrated need are
provided assistance re-
gardless of race, gender

or ethic background
 

of the admissions process in their
totality (grades, test scores, es-
say, recommendations, etc.), our
minority students are every bit as
qualiﬁed as the rest of the student
body.

Our goal of increasing the
number of minority candidates
with credentials appropriate to
our student body has brought
to our community students who
have excelled in the classroom
and enriched the university in ex-
tra- and co-curricular life.

Since it has been implied that

minority students take ﬁnancial
aid away from other students, it
is important to state unequivo-
cally that that is not the case.

The overwhelming number of
students at W&L with a demon-
strated need are provided assis-
tance regardless of race, gender
or ethic background.

Twenty years ago, women
students became an integral part
of undergraduate life at W&L.

Just as there is no question
now of the wisdom and ben-
eﬁt to W&L of co—education,
the same is true of our efforts to
bring more diversity of thought
and experience to the W&L stu-
dent body.

A classroom and a commu-
nity with varied experiences and
backgrounds is a better learning
space than one made up of a ho-
mogeneous population. We be-
lieve in the wisdom of a diverse
university community and will
continue to embody that belief
in policy.

We at W&L grow socially
and intellectually because of the
diverse contributions of every
single student on campus, with-
out exception.

to parent’s letter

To the Editor:

Dean Bill Hartog states the
policy of our Admissions Oﬂice
in his letter in this issue of the
Ring-tum Phi.

My statement that follows
afﬁrms and reinforces our total
commitment to that policy.

Washington and Lee recruits
only applicants who possess the
intellectual capacity, talent and
skills to ﬂourish academically
and contribute to the vibrancy
of our educational community.

We admit only the most
qualiﬁed among these appli-
cants considering all criteria for
admission.

These criteria include grades,
test scores, personal essays, rec-
ommendations and a variety of
attributes that indicate the ap-
plicants will thrive at W&L and
contribute to the community.

We seek students ﬁom a va-
riety of backgrounds and with a
wide array of skills, intellectual
specialties and interests.

Some of these students are
racial minorities, from urban
public high schools, from dif-
ferent nations or from families
with meager ﬁnancial means.

Some of them are athletes,
musicians, actors or artists.

Others display promise to be
government leaders or service
leaders. These students are from
Virginia, California, Maine and
Texas.

Some will study science and
others will study philosophy,
history, journalism or business.

All of these groups are wel-

come at W&L and are quali-
ﬁed not merely to survive but
to thrive.

The combination of all of
these groups of students make
us a richer moral and intellec-
tual community.

We actively recruit students
from these groups and others in
order to maintain a community
and educational environment
that will prepare all of our stu-
dents to contribute to the world
in which they will live.

We deplore and renounce
recent insinuations in letters
to the Ring-tum Phi that some
W&L students are less deserv-
ing of an education here than
others.

We are proud that a student
like Ligia Abreu, whose letter
is published in this issue of
the Phi, was attracted to come
from a middle class family in
Santo Domingo to W&L.

Abreu is the Head Dorrni-‘

tory Counselor this year and
will attend Yale Law School in
September.

She is not alone among our
students of color.

They, and students from
other groups, make our univer-
sity a better place.

We will continue to recruit
and welcome applicants from
many different groups whose
character, talents and academic
credentials qualify them to
contributeto W&L and to so-
ciety. '

deserving of an education here than others.

 

Let’s address journalistic
professionalism.

True: most newspapers
outside of alternative weekly
publications refuse to print
anonymous letters to the edi-
tor.

Most newspapers don’ op-
erate in a culture of fear. ’

Make no mistake, we ha /e
the First Amendment here,
but the community is either
too scared or too lazy to ex-
ercise it.

When one submits their
opinion to a newspaper, they
are using one of the most pure
and basic American rights.

They are also entering the
public forum.

This means that they
should also represent them-
selves truthfully, if they ex-
pect to be trusted.

But the people who write
letters to newspapers are gen-
erally part of the active com-
munity in which the newspa-
per is distributed.

The Phi editors recognized
last week’s Concerned Parent
letter as one that would rufﬂe
feathers on campus.

The man who wrote the
letter does not live on campus,
and is not obligated to have
any form of daily interaction
with its citizens.

His daughter,
does.

His daughter would be the
person forced to deal with the
feedback from this letter.

With this in mind, the Phi
agreed to respect his request
for anonymity.

We also printed every re-
sponse to his letter in this
week’s issue.

As stated every week in our
staff box, the opinions printed
in letters to the editor are not
the opinions of Phi staff mem-
bers.

Newspaper and community

Phi defends right of Concerned Parent to express opinion in open forum

If you don’t believe us,
look over at page four and
read the box for yourselves.

We reserve the right to print
anything a reader sends—so
long as we present it to the
community honestly, the way
we received it.

But presenting something
honestly is far from endorsing
it, as several readers have sug-
gested. '

It is disappointing and in-
sulting that several commu-
nity members have accused
the Phi staff of composing the
letter ourselves.

It is not uncommon for
parents and alumni to include
the Phi in their conversations
with the administration.

It is our right and duty to
print these conversations in an
open forum.

The Concerned Parent let-
ter is no different.

The Phi is available inthe
most non-discriminatory way
possible on campus: it’s free.

And each student, parent,
faculty member, staff mem-
ber and alumnus/alumna has
the right to read it and submit
a letter commenting on their
community.

The Phi does not see along
race lines, or divide the stu-
dent body into socioeconomic
groups.

If we did that, we would be
dividing ourselves.

As Professor DeLaney
points out in his letter this
week, we are a publication for
everyone in the Washington
and Lee community, includ-
ing students from many back-
grounds and many countries.

Outside of ethnic diversity,
the Phi is also representative
of students from different eco-
nomic groups.

Also included in this com-
munity of readers are the par-

thing a reader sends—so long as

estly, the way we received it. ”

ents, who are just as entitled
to their opinions and have the
same rights to voice them.

If you disagree with the
Concerned Parent, we wel-
come you to stand up and say
so, as six readers have.

It is the opinion of this edi-
torial board that not enough of
you care.

Too often, W&L students
look the other way and ig-
nore issues that drastically af-
fect your lives. It is easier to
worry about your grades than
to try and address the deep is-
sues that come with attending
a largely homogenous college
in rural Virginia.

Recently, the Phi has print-
ed letters to the editor sup-
porting the Posse program.

We have also run two sto-
ries covering the campus’s
positive response to minority
recruitment initiatives.

The Phi ﬁrst entered this
debate on Feb. 27 with our
staff editorial on the Posse
program.

But now, when we run a
letter showing a dissenting
opinion, the community is
outraged.

Be fair. The Concerned
Parent’s opinion may repre-
sent a certain section of the
Washington and Lee popula-
tion.

If he does not, as the many
response letters suggest, then
the Phi has simply served its
purpose as a forum.

If we were to only print our
opinion, and censor everyone
else’s, then we would be a pro-
paganda machine, no different
than the ofﬁcial newspapers
of the Chinese government.

The editors of the Phi do
not decide right and wrong.

We do not decide whether
these admissions policies are
worth the ﬁnancial initiatives,
and we do not determine the
worth of each student admit-
ted.

That job is left up to you,
the citizen.

The Phi serves merely as a
place where everyone can dis-
cuss it publicly.

One of the most beautiful
features of newspapers is the
microphone they provide to
the everyday citizen.

They provide a place where
not only public officials, but
also any caring citizen, can
come forward and be repre-
sented.

One citizen did just that--
and his right to speak up has
been summarily attacked.

We will not allow that
to happen. We will not take
sides.

Represent yourselves in
this discussion—write letters.

Care, and don’t take of-
fense when someone else who
cares disagrees with you. We
are begging you.

The above represents the
majority opinion of the edito-
rial staﬂ of the Ring-tum Phi.

Senior offers views on admissions

To the Editor:

I would like to respond to a
letter written by a Concerned
Parent in last week’s issue of
the Phi.

This anonymous contributor
opposes preferential admissions
practices based on any criteria
other than ‘merit,’ which the
author implicitly deﬁnes as a
combination of SAT and GPA
scores, though, conspicuously,
they only mention the SAT.

“Unequivocally, if a student
of any race is the best academi-
cally qualiﬁed and merits a po-
sition I salute him...skin color
should not be a factor, one way
or the other.”

If GPA, SAT and perhaps
standard—fare extracurricu-
lars were the only valid basis
for evaluation of candidates,
wouldn’t each new class appear
exceedingly dull and uniform?

The fact is, as a private insti-
tution, it is the university’s pre-
rogative to compose each class
as it sees ﬁt, employing what-
ever criteria it wants.

Does anyone really want a
class picked from the top 1,200
SAT scores out of the 3,900 ap-
plications received?

Some might say, “yes, obvi-
ously,” but for those of us who
can still clearly recall the na-
ture of that test, I should hope
the answer is, “no, obviously.”
Why?

Because it tests a very nar-
row subset of the mind’s capa-

T he fact is, I suspect this parent would like to

see the Posse Foundation ‘summarily rejected’

because they are worried one of the Posse

members might ‘take ’their childis‘ spot.
 

bilities, and leaves out many
that are relevant to succeeding
in college and in life.

Moreover, richer people can
prepare for it better — not only
through many years of superior
schooling, but also through ex-
pensive preparation courses,
and even, in some cases, per-
sonal coaches.

The Concerned Parent men-
tions a personal visit by Jona-
than Webster, Associate Dean of
Admissions, to Glenelg Coun-
try School, a private institution
with which the parent is (pre-
sumably) connected.

Firstly, I cannot help but
point out that a Dean of Admis-
sions from W&L did not visit
my high school — presumably
Glenelg enjoys a closer relation-
ship to W&L than most of the
high schools represented here.

One can only imagine the
beneﬁt Glenelg’s reputation
confers in the admissions pro-
cess.

The concerned parent men-
tions their high school sopho-
more.

Does this child attend Gle-

nelg?

Will they enjoy the beneﬁts
of intense and expensive SAT
preparation?

The parent advises that the
Posse Foundation’s proposal (to
admit a group of intercity stu-
dents using special, unconven-
tional criteria) should be “sum-
marily rejected.”

Does the parent mean that
this proposal should be rejected
out of hand, without being given
serious consideration?

Why should we take the par-
ent’s concerns seriously, if they
reﬁrse to entertain alternative
views on admissions criteria?

Presumably, the parent would
profess that they intend a ‘true
meritocracy. ’

Surely this entails ‘need
blind’ admissions, since ability
to pay is not a component of
academic merit.

But the availability of the
early decision option is directly
contradictory to the spirit of
need—blind admissions policies.

Why?

Because only very rich peo-
ple can comfortably commit to

a college before getting a ﬁnan-
cial aid package.

Poorer students are explic-
itly discouraged from applying
early decision.

‘Full-pays’ are at an advan-
tage in the admissions process,
and this is the best-kept secret
of the ‘need-blind’ admissions
lie.

Early decision is a thinly dis-
guised means for the rich to tele-
graph their ﬁnancial strength to
the university, even while ﬁnan-
cial documents are ostensibly
kept separate.

The fact is, I suspect this par-
ent would like to see the Posse
Foundation ‘summarily reject-
ed’ because they are worried
one of the Posse members might
‘take’ their child’s spot.

Moreover, I would suggest
their supposed indicators of ‘real
merit’ are precisely those which
people in their social position
have succeeded in mastering.

One-hundred points on the
SAT costs $1200.

That is the going rate.

This parent feels threatened
by alternative schemes of candi-
date evaluation; let them be.

Do they have W&L’s best
interests at heart, or their own
self-interest?

Let us reafﬁrrn our universi-
ty’s right to compose each class
as it sees ﬁt, and not be a slave
to a narrow set of criteria.

Remembrance of things past

An event-ﬁlled weekend awaits alumni who make the journey back to their alma mater

Alumni from across the country return to W&L

to reunite with friends, reminisce about the past

and attend events and parties. While changes

have taken place since they left, they plan to

revisit favorite places and people.

STAFF wn ITER

It is that time of year when
the green lawn invites people to
lie on it and alumni swarm the
campus for one glorious week-
end to relive old memories.

Honoring the graduates of
1951 to 2001, the weekend offi-
cially starts today with activities
planned for the Class of 1971.

For some, the trip will be
mixing business with plea-
sure. The spring meeting of the
Alumni Board of Directors will
continue through the weekend.

Special tours will be given to
highlight the changes the cam-
pus has undergone, especially
the introduction of women to
Washington and Lee.

One female alumna said she
was grateful for the school’s
recognition of the choice to go
co-ed.

With both an M.A. and a
Ph.D. from Princeton Univer-
sity, there is no question that
Professor Marc Conner is a
force to be reckoned with in
the classroom.

He is a force to be reckoned
with in the realm of martial
arts as well.

Professor Conner has been
involved in different forms
of martial arts for the past 15
years.

He has obtained two ﬁrst-
degree black belts and one sec-

Master H. David Clements,
Conner’s Karate Master at an
Amherst, Va. karate school,
reported that only one in 1,000
Karate students move on to
achieve the black belt, accord-
ing to a Washington and Lee
press release.

Conner’s accomplishments
are not easy to achieve. In
Master Clements’s career he
has only awarded about 20
second- degree black belts.

Conner asserted that the
challenge of receiving his
black belt was made easier for
him by his love of learning.

Seven years ago, Profes-
sor Conner began his karate
career.

Karate is his favorite of
the martial arts forms he has

a part of a minority in any way,”
said Shelley Milligan, co-chair
for the Class of 1996.

Any strain felt by the female
students then came not from
their male counterparts but from
the women previously bussed
in.

“There was still a bit of ten-
sion between W&L women and
those from neighboring women’s
colleges who would visit Lex-
ington during the weekends,”
said Milligan, who worked at
W&L after graduating.

“I think that the inﬂuence of
women from nearby places was
pretty much gone from W&L by
the early 2000s. Sure, some still
visited, but not in the masses
that they came during my fresh-
man year, for example.”

A presentation in Lee Chapel
on Friday will be about the his-
tory of coeducation. At the pre-
sentation will be John Delane
Wilson, the president of W&L
from 1983-1995, who oversaw

mastered because of the phi-
losophy behind it and the dis-
cipline it requires.

“It is nice to study the East-
em arts because my teach-
ing is focused on the Western
world,” said Conner.

He is accomplished with
many weapons including bow
staffs, nunchucks, knives and
swords.

Self-defense is also a part
of the martial arts.

Professor Conner is ca-
pable of defending himself
against attackers who come at
him by hand, with knives and
even with guns.

His skills are demonstrat-
ed in exhibitions and competi-
tions.

Karate is also a hobby that
Conner shares with his fam-
ily. He has three sons, two of
which are already involved in
karate.

When he is no longer phys-
ically able to practice karate,
he sees himself returning to
his previous hobbies of car-
pentry and ﬂy-ﬁshing.

Conner said, “As I became
more involved with martial
arts, I gave up my other hob-
bies because I knew martial
arts would be a hobby I could
do with my children.”

Now Professor Conner is
also a karate instructor, which
allows him to spend even more
time with his sons.

Since he is an easygo-
ing professor, most students
would not guess that Conner
has the ability to break boards
or wield nunchucks.

Teaching English to college
students and teaching karate to
younger students has its simi-
larities and its differences.

Conner said, “There is a
good distinction between the
two. Teaching here is deﬁnite-
ly my passion, even though I
can’t make English students
do push-ups.”

Also in attendance will be
Jenny Stratton, the first female
president of the Alumni Board
of Directors and a member of
the ﬁrst class of women.

Alumni can roam the cam-
pus, participate in any of the
college’s many open houses, or
even learn a foreign language in
mini, 20-minute classes.

For those who arrive late,
a barbeque bash at Zollman’s
for the six most recent reunion
classes will be the ﬁrst chance
to catch up on life changes. The
party will continue as the band
Right On provides entertain-
ment.

“For some reason, no matter
how far removed we get from
W&L, Zollman’s is always a
draw,” said Milligan.

For those who awake early,
Acting President Harlan Beck-
ley will be at a breakfast in Ev-
ans Dining Hall. The new presi-
dent, Ken Ruscio, who is also
celebrating his thirtieth reunion,
will be the breakfast’s special
guest.

Following the breakfast,
Milligan and Margaret “Kippie”
Griffin will receive the school’s
Distinguished Young Alumna
Award.

Given to alumni who have
shown service and loyalty to
the school and community, the
award was meant to recognize

Conner demonstrates the skills that enabled him to test for and acquire his

the extraordinary young alumni
for their achievements.

Many of the people traveling
to W&L this weekend are not
only coming for their memories
but because of their commit-
ment to the school.

“The people coming are all
the people that I would have
expected to come,” said Townes
Pressler, co-chair for the Class
of 1986. “Most were very in-
volved with the school when we
were there and stay involved.”

Over the years, classmates
have spread out all over the na-
tion, but Pressler said the dis-
tance will not make a difference
in the numbers attending.

“The ones that were commit-
ted when we were in school are
still committed,” he said. “I do
not think that a three—hour ﬂight
is much different than a three-
hour drive for the others.”

Milligan agreed that other
life factors would be why some
alumni would not come back.

“It’s a busy season for many
of us, some with young chil-
dren, demanding jobs, etc,” she
said. “Most everyone I’ve talk-
ed to wants to come back, but
for some it’s just not feasible at
this point.”

The draw may be seeing
friends for some alumni, but for
others, it is the school and the

memories it holds.

“I think what I remember
most fondly is the way W&L
fosters community,” said Mil-
ligan. “I loved faculty who
declared that their spring term
class met on the Colonnade un-
der a certain tree, and if it was
raining, no class.I loved mid-
night breakfast breaks in the
D-hall during exam week. . .‘I
loved special events like Fancy
Dress, Mock Convention and
all the great speakers that would
come.”

“In general, I look back on
those four years so fondly and
hope that today’s students are
enjoying all that W&L oﬁers.”

THE RING-TUM PHI ' 7

On Sunday a group of Washington and Lee students
attended the Rally to Stop Genocide In Washington, D.C.
The purpose of the rally was to encourage the govern-
ment to take steps to Improve the situation In Darfur
and to express concern over the human rights violations
occurring in the Sudan.

This area has been a region of turmoil for years, but
in 2003, the situation grew dire. Rebel groups began to
ﬁght against the government-backed mllltla. The mllltla
has invaded civilian areas, killing, raping and looting.

Over 400,000 people have died in Darfur thus far, and
2.5 million nationals have been displaced.

“Seelng so many people come out to support this
cause was so energizing and has given me more hope to-

from campus, students believe that it is our problem as
well.

STAFF WRITER

The lights go out. The techno
beat starts to pound. Suddenly a
whirlwind of black lights, glow
sticks and tap shoes attacks the
audience as the dance begins.

And that’s just one of the acts.

Last weekend, the Washing-
ton and Lee Dance Companies
thrilled audiences with their an-
nual Spring Concert.

The decade-themed produc-
tion featured pieces from many
areas of music, drawing on many
musical styles including classical,
modern, techno, Broadway and
oldies.

The show featured both profes-
sional and student choreographed
pieces from all genres of dance.

Senior Mary Christopher and
sophomore Julia Pieasants even
managed to choreograph one
dance with two alumnae via e-
mail and video, not actually re-
hearsing the dance together until
a few days before the show.

This year’s concert has pre-
sented some unique challenges for
the dancers due to a change in the
performance location. With the
Lenfest Center’s Keller Theater
reserved for another production,
the dancers were forced to move
the concert to the smaller John-
son Theater, sometimes called the
“black-box theater.”

Though the smaller stage re-
quired some choreography adjust-

‘ ments, the girls have been able to

cope with the changes and utilize
the theater’s unique style to their
advantage.

“The Johnson Theater is a lot
more interactive,” Christopher
said. “lt’s a lot more fun, a lot
more playful and you really can
feed olf the audience a lot more
because you’re on the same level
with them.”

The company also chose to
have more performances to com-
pensate for a smaller audience
seating area.

Because the W&L Ballet
Company rehearses with Shenan-
doah Dance Academy, a local
dance studio, these dancers get
the unique experience of working
with local high school students as
well as their college friends.

Several of the conce1t’s ballet
pieces featured area high school
seniors along with the W&L com-
pany.

Sophomore Alice Shih sees
these local students as an asset to
the program.

“I think ﬁrst of all it’s great
for W&L because W&L students
don't tend to reach out much to
the community or be part of the
community as much,” Shih said.
“But this really allows us to get
to know people outside of W&L.
It’s a great way to get to know
other people, especially younger
kids.”

Though switching theaters cre-
ated some confusion, the greatest
obstacle the show faced was sim-

ply coordinating everyone’s busy
schedules.

The dancers are involved in a
myriad of clubs, sororities, and
projects, not to mention their di-
verse academic interests, and this
diversity leads to a scheduling
nightmare.

With four years of schedule
juggling under her belt, senior
Elizabeth Little knows about last-
minutes rehearsals, saying, “It’s
hard to get everybody together to
rehearse. I didn’t think we were
going to have everybody until the
show.”

While the differing interests of
the women make scheduling for
rehersals problematic, this dif-
ficulty is also the strength of the
dance program.

The vast diversity of women in
the program is perhaps its greatest
asset.

For sophomore Blaire Mon-
roe, dance has been a unifying
activity, bringing together a wide
array of students.

“It’s not a set type of girl,”
Monroe said. “That’s what I enjoy
about it. It’s diﬂ°erent from being
in a sorority or a club.

We’re all interested in dance,
but it brings together a variety of
different ages and backgrounds.”

The variety of the dancers’ past

“Its not a set type of
girl. That is what I
enjoy about dance].
It is dzﬂerent from be-
ing in a sorority or a
club. We ’re all inter-
ested in dance, but it
brings together a vari-
ety of dzﬂerent ages

and backgrounds. ”

BLAIRE MONROE,

training also lends to the unique-
ness of the company.

Students come from a wide ar-
ray of dance backgrounds, rang-
ing from no previous experience
to a lifetime of training.

Pieasants was even raised in
an artist colony in nearby Am-
herst, Va.

“It’s really fun to have these
girls who are strictly hip—hop
dancers dancing with girls who
are classically ballet and girls
who are Broadway-style tap danc-
ers,” says Christopher. “We have
this one girl this year who belly
dances.”

The dancers emphasize the
group’s welcoming atmosphere
and encourage any interested
persons to attend a rehearsal, ad-
vising any potential members to
watch campus notices for practice
times and locations.

“It’s very open. It’s very re-
laxed. It’s not an intimidating set-
ting at all,” Pieasants said. “We
want people.”

The rich variety of dance
styles, colors, music and lights in
this weekend’s performances was
just another way in which W&L
Dance cultivates diversity on our
campus.

The energy and passion of the
dancers made the concert an event
to be remembered.

“You know what?” Pieasants
said. “We’ve got spirit!”

Alums return to former exploits

hook-ups and general debauchery of yesteryear

Returning to W&L means returning to the parties,

SHE SAID

Spring term is really just one
event, weekend, and party after
another.

Classes are there to break up
the monotony.

On that note, now that all my
professors are cursing the day I
entered their classroom, it’s time
to tackle yet another “she says”
article.

The topic this time around?
Alumni weekend.

All of our favorite alumni,
plus a bunch we would rather not
see again due to sketchy “you’re a
senior and I won’t have to see you
everyday next year” hook ups,
return to lurk around campus and
play student all over again.

So now that they are returning,
what do we, as the lovely ladies
actually attending class here, do
about it?

Do we hook up with the al-
ums?

There are many things you
have to take into consideration
before you tackle this question.

For instance, is he married?
Yeah, that would not be cool.

How about this one: did he
graduate with my dad?

Does he have pictures of his
grandkids in his wallet? Gross.
I don’t even want to write about
this topic anymore. But alas, I
have to continue.

Let’s say he’s a little younger-
like he graduated within the past
decade or maybe even_ this cen-
tury.

Does his mom still tuck him
in?

There is a point when the cost
beneﬁts of living with mom and
dad are totally overshadowed by
the sheer disappointment of it all.

Then it is considered a pity
hook up, which is not a good feel-
ing to wake up with. That, plus
a hangover can almost ruin your
entire weekend.

Also, what if you ﬁnd yourself
really falling for the alumnus who
has caught your eye?

First, I’m just going to assume
he’s age appropriate for my stom-
ach’s sake.

Second I am going to tell you
to forget it.

He is here for the weekend.
That’s it.

He comes once a year to ﬁnd
a girl like you, shotgun way too
many Natty Lights, and return
to the real world to make his co-
workers even more jealous of the
fact that they did not attend Wash-
ington and Lee.

You’re just a water cooler
story— no better or worse than the
discussion of Sunday night’s epi-
sode of Grey’s Anatomy.

Yet there is the lure of the

The darker side
of sunbathing

With bathing suitsea-
son here, tanning is a
popular activity. A&L
Editor Kathryn Krall
gives you the do’s and
don’t’s of laying out.

Don’t expose yourself to the
midday sun. If you are outside
between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., try to
stay in the shade. Laying out for
the purpose of becoming tanned
or burned is nonproductive, bor-
ing, sweaty and, most important-
ly, dangerous.

Don’t count on clothing to
protect you, especially if they
are loose-knit or light-colored.
Clothes are about SPF 30, and
if you burn easily, you can burn
through your clothing.

Don’t ignore your skin type.
A person with red or blonde hair,
blue eyes and freckles burns much
more easily than other skin types.

Don’t use tanning salons.
Many salons exceed the safe limit
of UV rays and can cause an in-
creased chance of cancer. Be-
sides, fake-baking leads to an or-
ange tint that is never attractive.

Do wear sunscreen of at least
SPF 15 if you plan to be in the
sun. Even if you are not laying
out at the beach, daily sun expo-
sure, such as a tennis game or the
walk to freshman parking, can be
risky. Plus, sunscreen smells re-
ally nice.

Do reapply sunscreen every
two hours. Sweat, water and
time erode the lotion and leave
your skin unprotected. Besides
the increasing the chance of skin
cancer, prolonged exposure to
the sun leads to leathery skin and
early wrinkles. Even if you are
willing to sacriﬁce your health
for beauty, you should realize that

tanning will cause your skin will
show signs of premature aging.

Do wear sunglasses that of-
fer 99 percent or 100 percent
UV protection. This ﬁghts sight
problems and blindness that could
result from excessive exposure to
the sun. The tint should be dark,
but not so dark that you cannot
tell a red light from a green light.

Do wear a style of sunglasses
that not only protects your eyes,
but also covers the delicate skin
around your eyes. The large-
framed glasses that are in fashion

I respect and applaud all of the

W&L every year during alumni

The alumni are here only one

Why do I celebrate these ﬁne

Because I am 100 percent
certain that I will be the sketchy
23 year-old returning in 2009
to puke on the frat lawn for old
times and maybe make out with
some chick. . .any chick.

That’s the beauty of alumni
weekend; you can’t get made
fun of by your friends for hook-
ing up with a less—than-attractive
girl because most of them won’t
_be there. , .;

Therefore, when the hard-

working pledge bros with real
jobs call you to ask about the
weekend, you can tell them you
went back to the old stomping
grounds and still brought the A-
game. Legit.

There is no problem with
alumni hooking up who gradu-
ated in the last decade.

It’s when the drunk girl hooks
up with the 36-year-old lawyer
when things get unpleasant.

Yet when a senior frat lord goes
after the MILF and seduces her
with a bottle of cheap wine and
fancy dialect, glory is achieved.

Basically, girls can only harm
their reputation during alumni
weekend while guys can create
awesome stories and obtain awe-
some nicknames.

The aforementioned tale of
mother seduction was achieved
last year by a young alumnus.

This story is the reason that
many freshman boys are extreme-
ly excited to meet the 23 year-old
investment banker (damn, he has
a real job) who will be returning
to campus on Friday to attempt
and conquer alumni weekend
once again.

When people ask about this
legend, they often use this story to
describe his character and immor-
talize him in the alumni weekend
hall of fame.

I can only dream of the day
when I’m teaching eleventh grade
history and coaching JV baseball
and basketball at my old high
school and get to return to W&L

If you're like most Washington & Lee seniors, your college career has been packed with accomplishment

to attempt to dominate the campus
as an alumnus. . .because dominat-
ing as an undergrad hasn’t really
worked out.

Nonetheless, all alumni re-
ceive a cloak of coolness when
they return to campus.

I have no idea what the guys
who graduated in 1990 were con-
sidered cool when they went here,
but I imagine they ruled W&L be-
cause of their awesome stories.

These narratives coupled with
super-hyper-mega fratty tattoos
on their ankles made them way
cooler than any current students.

Who knows whether their
stories of buying a huge sling-
shot and ﬁring a rock that went
through the Phi Delt house actu-
ally happened.

The main thing is that I can tell
kids that it did happen in 12 years
when I’m coaching and teaching
at my old high school (lofty aspi-
rations).

The key of alumni weekend is
absolute debauchery. Guys who
hazed you last year and hung
out afterwards are now old and
washed up while you still have a
year or two left of the best years
of your life.

Meanwhile the dudes who
graduated many moons ago can
now bask in their frat glory and
tell stories of their hammered
hey-day.

Come back alumni, you are
missed, and the freshman girls
might not know any better.

Baseball

The W&L baseball team lost its two ﬁrst games of the
ODAC tournament to Bridgewater College (2-6) and
Guilford College (4-5, 11 innings) to end their season at 18-
15-1. In the ﬁrst game, Bridgewater starter Ricky Reed only
allowed a pair of runs through nine innings to pick up the
win. The next day against Guilford, senior outﬁelder Dave
MacKenzie singled home two in the top of the ninth to give
the Generals a 4-3 advantage, but the lead was relinquished
and the squad ended up losing in the bottom of the 11”‘
inning.

Women’s Lacrosse

The Generals cruised to the ODAC championship by
defeating Virginia Wesleyan 13-7. Senior Louisa Feve ended
her ODAC career by scoring 3 goals and accounting for 1
assist in the victory. The Generals are currently ranked tenth
in the country and will learn who they play in the NCAA
tournament on May 7.

Golf

The Generals ﬁnished second in the ODAC, falling to.
defending National Champion Guilford College. The
Generals were led by Freshman Beau Allen who shot two
rounds of 74. Allen was named Co—Rookie of the Year in the
ODAC, while teammate Nathaniel James was named ODAC
player of the year and Anthony Zappin received ODAC Golf
Scholar Athlete of the Year honors.

Lax falls to Roanoke

Loss in ODAC tournament marks the close of a disappointing season for men

By Madeline Gent
surr warren

A disappointing loss to arch-
rival Roanoke College ended the
men’s lacrosse season yesterday.

They went into the game with

_ high hopes.

With a win over the Randolph-
Macon College Yellow Jackets,
the Washington and Lee men’s
lacrosse team secured themselves
a spot in playoffs.

The Generals opened their
week with a night game against
their neighbors, the VMI Key-
dets, in the nineteenth annual
Lee-Jackson lacrosse classic.

The Generals secured their win
with a strong second quarter, out-
scoring the Keydets 3-0 as well
as a stellar performance from the
game’s MVP, goalie Chris Lalli.

The Keydets took an early 4-1
lead with a little over six minutes
left in the ﬁrst quarter. They were
led by two assists and a goal from
sophomore Kevin Hill. Hill ﬁn-
ished the game with four goals

and two assists and is the VMI
recipient of the Worrell-Fallon
award. Lalli was the Generals’
recipient.

Lalli ﬁnished the game with
14 saves.

The Generals were led by a
team effort as sophomore Ned
Rider and freshmen Tim Skeen
and Harry St. John each scored
two goals. Skeen also recorded
two assists in the Generals’ 9-8
victory.

“The environment was incred-
ible--a night game, rowdy fans
and packed stands... it was like
nothing I have ever played in be-
fore,” said St. John, and he said
he hoped the fans would follow
the team again to the semiﬁnal
match yesterday.

On Saturday the team traveled
to Randolph-Macon and left with
a 12-7 victory over the Yellow
Jackets.

Again, the win can be attrib-
uted to a strong second quarter as
the Generals shut out their oppo-
nent, going on a 5-0 rim.

“We knew we controlled our
own destiny heading into the
Randolph-Macon game, with a
win getting us in the ODAC tour-
nament, so we were happy with
the outcome, but we know that
we can play better lacrosse,” said
junior Grant Martin.

Martin ﬁnished the game with
one goal and an assist.

The Generals managed to grab
40 of the garne’s 59 ground balls
while goalies Chris Lalli and
freshman Alex Heaton combined
for nine saves.

The Generals also out-shot
their opponents 38 to 23.

St. John led the General’s with
three goals and two assists while
Randolph-Macon’s sophomore
Paul Johnsen led his team with
three goals.

Junior Jim Ryan and Skeen
each added two goals for the
Generals and Senior Clark F inney
added two assists.

The Generals concluded their
season yesterday at 4:00 p.m.
against Roanoke College in Roa-
noke. St. John pointed out that
anything could have happened.
“If we’ve learned anything this
season it’s that anyone can beat
anyone,” he said. The team was
hoping to avenge their loss from
earlier in the season, he said.

The men fell 16-9, ending their
season on a bitter note.

Roanoke will go on to play
Lynchburg, who defeated Hamp-
den-Sydney 10-9 on Tuesday.

Willams vs. Bush

Texans missed chance at ‘Michael Jordan ’of running backs

By NEIL “JEFF FRANCOEUR”
SHEAFFER
5 TA F F w R Ir E R

So Friday night (the night be-
fore the draft), I was lying in bed,
dead tired, when I hear a knock on
the door. It was my friend Jorts.
He walks in and broke the news
to me. The Texans had made an
agreement with Mario Williams
(6 years, $54 million) to make
him the ﬁrst pick in the 2006 NFL
Draﬁ. The ﬁrst thought to go
through my head, “With the sec-
ond pick in the 1984 NBA Draft
the Portland Trailblazers select
Sam Bowie from the University
of Kentucky.” It was really a
system overload for me. I was
not in the state of mind to try and
comprehend the ramiﬁcations of
the Texans’ actions. Reggie Bush
looks like he has the chance to
become the Michael Jordan of the
running back position. There’s a
good chance that Mario Williams
is more like Hakeem Olajuwan,
who was drafted ﬁrst by the Rock-
ets and had a great career, but he
was no Michael Jordan. I guess
we will have to wait and see what
happens. Until then, I will try and
put my convoluted thoughts down
on paper.

May I please recap Reggie
Bush’s most recent season for
you? Okay, he rushed 200 times
for 1740 yards, an average of 8.4
yards per carry (basically unheard
of), and 16 touchdowns, caught
37 passes for 478 yard and 2
touchdowns, and returned punts
and kicks, including one punt for
a touchdown. I have seen many
great college football players, in-
cluding Desmond Howard, Ricky
Williams, Donovan McNabb,
Kyle Luby (the rumors are true:
water covers 2/3 of the Earth,
while Luby covers the other 1/3),
and so many more. All of the guys
listed were great football players
(many still are), but I have never
seen a player with as much talent
as Reggie Bush. He is the most
versatile, most explosive and just
ﬂat out the best college football
player I have ever seen.

Mario Williams could be

the missing niece for the Tex-

ans, but, in my opinion, if they
were not going to draft Reggie
Bush, shouldn’t they have taken
D’Brickashaw Ferguson, the best
offensive lineman in the draft?
There is no way he can be ex-
pected to develop as he should if
he has no protection in front of
him. I had the chance to watch an
interview with Charley Casserly,
the Texans GM. He claimed that
the picking of Mario Williams
was purely a football decision. I
don’t believe this for a number of
reasons.

A) Reggie Bush is amazing. If
it were a football decision, Cas-
serly would have picked Reggie
Bush without glancing at Wil-
liams.

B) Bush can demand $5 — $10
million more than any other play-
er in the draft purely because he
is a uniquely exceptional football
player and so much better than
anyone else in the draft. The Heis-
man also ups the asking price.

C) There is a chance that the
whole ﬁasco about Reggie’s par-
ents’ home came into play here. I
doubt it.

Good, pass-rushing defen-
sive ends are hard to come by in
the NFL, and Mario Williams is
a physical specimen at 6’7” and
293 pounds. He runs a 4.73 40-
yard dash, which is exceptional
for a player of his size. He has
been compared to Julius Pep-
pers, who has been excellent in
the NFL. Reggie Bush, on the
other hand, has been compared
to Hall of Famer Gail Sayers. If
you could choose between having
Sayers and Peppers who would
you choose? Exactly.

You may be yelling at me right
about now, “Yol Dude! The Tex-
ans already have Domanick Davis,
a running back who has averaged
over 1,000 yards per season since
he arrived in the league, and he
can also catch the ball out of the
backﬁeld. The Texans don’t need
another running back no matter
how good he is!” Davis is no Reg-
gie Bush. Also, Davis was never
ﬁilly healthy last year and has not
been the most durable back, so it
makes sense to me for the Texans
to have some insurance. Or you

might be yelling at me, “Defense
wins championships!” It sure
does. I cannot agree more, but
if his college career mirrors his
NFL career at all, defenses cannot
stop Reggie Bush. Others may
be saying, “Bush never carried a
full load in college and isn’t ready
to be an every down back in the
NFL.” That is a load of malar-
key. He carried the ball 200 times
last season while LenDale White,
the “tougher” back, carried it 197
times and still got hurt. Reggie
has no history of injury, so do not
try and tell me that Reggie can’t
take the physical play in the NFL.
He will be ﬁne.

There is a good chance that
it goes down in history as one of
the most important drafts of the
next few decades, just as the 1984
NBA Draft will always be remem-
bered as one of the greatest drafts
ever. A player like Reggie Bush
(or Michael Jordan) comes along
only once a generation.

A Saturday night inside the squad cars of

O

the Lexington Police Department

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS EDITOR

LEXINGTON--The dispatch
radio cackled to life, bringing
the ﬁrst call of Lexington Police
Sargeant. Bucky Miller’s 12-hour
shift on Saturday.

“Fifteen-20 to Central, I’ve
just picked up a black and white
collie mix with a collar and a lead
on it. Is there a way I can take the
dog over to the SPCA?”

Miller picked up his micro-
phone to answer Ofﬁcer Nathan
Kesterson.

The Sergeant said he would
meet Ofﬁcer Kesterson at the
SPCA building to help get the dog
locked up for the night.

Every weekend Miller and oth-

er oﬂicers patrol the streets of the
city, dealing with everything from
stray dogs to noise complaints to
drunk drivers.

On a regular weekend evening
anywhere from two to four ofﬁ-
cers will be on duty.

Saturday night there were
three oﬂicers on duty until mid-
night and two on duty after that.

After he and Kesterson tried
unsuccessfully to ﬁnd a way into
the SPCA building, they went to
the house of an SPCA worker and
asked her to come let the dog into
the building.

Kesterson took the dog back
to the shelter, and Miller resumed
his patrol.

Miller cruises the city streets
in an unmarked dark blue Crown

Victoria. The officers do not have
set patrol routes or sections of
the city that they are supposed to
cover.

Miller says the officers do not
divide the city into sections be-
cause it is so small, but also be-
cause they think it is important
for each ofﬁcer to get to know
people all over town rather than
in just one neighborhood.

He starts his weekend shift
when he stops by the police sta-
tion to check in and begin his pa-
trol.

Some nights will be quiet with
only a few calls, like Saturday,
while others, like Friday will
seem full of almost non-stop ac-
tion.

whichthe SPCA
reports is an Austra-
lian Shepherd, Miller resumes his
driving patrol, listening to radio
trafﬁc from Rockbridge County.
The squad car’s radio can pick
up not only the Lexington Police
calls, but also traﬂic from the
Rockbridge County Sheriff, the
Buena Vista Police Department,
the Buena Vista Rescue Service,
Virginia Military Institute’s Post
Police and even the radio traffic
from Washington and Lee’s secu-
rity department.

When Kesterson calls the dis-
patcher to say that the dog broke
his collar and escaped from out-
side the SPCA building, Miller
simply only shakes his head.

Kesterson searches the area
around the SPCA but cannot ﬁnd
the dog.

He radios Miller and asks
where he would like to eat. They
settle on Frank’s Pizza and Subs.

After two hours, Miller has
done little but drive around the
seemingly deserted streets.

He and Kesterson sit in
Frank’s talking politics. The
owner and waitresses all seem to
know Miller, and jokes with the
waitresses about one girl ’s newly
orange hair.

Finally, at 11:30 p.m., Miller

sitting around their cars in the
Kroger parking lot.

The unmarked car pulls into
the lot, and before Miller can
even pull up to the kids they are
starting to scatter. Miller does
not even have to say anything to
get the kids to move.

“I won’t waste my breath,”
he says. “They know they’re not
supposed to hang out there.”

Miller, who grew up in Lex-
ington, has worked for the city’s
police department since 1985.
He played football at Virginia
State University, located in Pe-
tersburg. His entire law en-
forcement career has been spent
in his hometown.

Miller says he isn’t sure how
much of his time is devoted to
Washington and Lee students or
permanent residents.

“It depends on what day of
the week it is,” Miller said.

Miller said that the oﬂicers
deal with students more on the
weekend, but even then he says
the number of calls or arrests var-
ies from week to week. Regard-
less of the varying time commit-
ments, Miller says he does not

Sigma pledge breaks mold

Jameson Graber becomes ﬁrst white man to join W&L is historically black fraternities

By Julie Petersen
STAFF WRITER

Those Washington and Lee stu-
dents lucky enough to be passing
by the Commons on the evening
of April 26 were able to catch a
glimpse of Phi Beta Sigma’s main
pledgeship event——the probate.

For the new initiates, who tra-
ditionally pledge in secrecy, the
probate is their opportunity to an-
nounce their aﬂiliation with their
new fraternity, demonstrate their
knowledge of fraternal traditions
and entertain the audience with
their greetings to other Greek or-
ganizations.

“Basically our probates are
supposed to be a fun entertain-
ment to get people hyped up,
maybe joke around with other
people and have fun,” said Junior
pledge Marcurius Byrd.

But aside from the antics of
the performance, spectators soon
noticed another curious sight—a
white man on the pledge line of
this historically black fraterni-
ty. Throughout the probate and
since, this unusual occurrence has
raised more than a few eyebrows
and even more questions.

As W&L’s ﬁrst non-minority

“I just felt like the guys in Phi Beta Sigma were

principled. That they were motivated by some-

thing a little bit deeper. ”

JAMESON GRABER, Class of 2008
 

member of the traditionally black
Greek organizations, sophomore
Jameson Graber, along with his
new Phi Beta Sigma fraternity
brothers, is helping to tear down
barriers on our campus by just
hanging out with his friends.
Unlike the historically black
sororities on campus, Phi Beta
Sigma has its own charter at
W&L. The two sororities are
associated with chapters at other
schools. Delta Sigma Theta joined
a chapter at Roanoke College, and
the Alpha Kappa Alpha joined a
graduate chapter in Roanoke.
Graber is eager to explain that,
though his decision may be un-
orthodox here at W&L, Phi Beta
Sigma is just the right ﬁt for him.
“I think those who know me
know that I am full of endless
contradictions. I want to say I’m
sort of counter-cultural, but at the

same time I consider myself pret-
ty conservative,” said Graber. “I
just don’t identify with the main-
stream usually.”

Graber was exposed to the
fraternity scene last year as a
freshman and opted to remain an
Independent, deciding that most
fraternal cultures did not coin-
cide with his own sense of priori-
ties. When he joined this year’s
Student Activities Organization
basketball team, he found himself
building friendships with many
of the Sigma members. After
spending time with the brothers
and learning about the fratemity’s
goals, particularly its community
service involvement, pledging
felt like the next natural step.

“I already had a connection
with them, so I wasn’t just joining
a group to gain status or anything.
I was just joining something that

my friends were already in,” said
Graber.

Phi Beta Sigma tends to at-
tract many members who would
have otherwise chosen to forego
the traditional W&L fraternity
experience. The ﬂedgling Beta
Beta Nu chapter was brought to
campus just last year to provide
a unique Greek experience for
those men not satisﬁed with the
current options. Charter mem-
bers, as well as this year’s diverse
line, found themselves drawn to
the fratemity’s accepting attitude
and commitment to community
service.

“The best thing about our
frat is that you are who you are.
We’re not there to change you.
We’re all different people, differ-
ent backgrounds,” said fraternity
secretary and charter member Ju-
lian Ledford.

Phi Beta Sigma was the ﬁrst of
the historically black fraternities
to open its membership to non-
minority men. Since that deci-
sion, the fraternity has shifted its
attentions to focus on multicultur-
alism and acceptance, rather than
a single race.

“Sigma prides itself in being a
brotherhood of diverse people,”

said Chris Rucker, a freshman
pledge.

Sigma members emphasize
that the true binding force of
their brotherhood is not any type
of ethnicity, but instead their
passion for community service.
When most fraternities are gear-
ing up for their next big party,
the W&L Sigmas can usually be
found playing basketball with
the boys at Natural Bridge Cor-
rectional Facility or raising funds
for the Staunton Pregnancy Help
Center at the Walk for Life. For
Graber, who organized the W&L
Walk for Life team, the fratemi-
ty’s focus on service conveyed a
set of priorities more in sync with
his own.

“I just felt like the guys in Phi
Beta Sigma were principled. That
they were motivated by something
a little bit deeper,” said Graber.
“The Sigmas on this campus are
real. There’s something genuine
about them.”

The new brotherhood has been
encouraged by this year’s line and
expects to grow in numbers in fu-
ture years.

“You know,” said Junior Frank
Lee, “there’s just not that much
difference between us.”

Here is the latest update on who
ran afoul of the law during the last
few weeks. We took a peek at this
weeks police reports to see what

you ’ve been up to...

 

Not the time for a
stoll around town

Lexington resident Frank
Merchant was arrested and
charged with public intoxi-
cation on Friday, April 28.
Merchant, who is 23-years-
old, was stopped at 10:53

6. Stewart, who joined the
Lexington Police in Novem-
ber, stopped the 25- year-
old Moore and arrested him
at 11:20 p.m.

Local joins visitors
Jesse Lyons, a 27-year-old
who lives in Lexington, was

Huffman of the Lexington
Police Department on Sat-
urday, May 6 at 11:51 p.m.

other Lexington Police of-
ﬁcers were at the gas station
when Manning arrived to

purchase some food.

distinguish between students and
other residents.

“I don’t look at it as student
population and town population.
I just look at it as one commu-
nity,” he said.

The sergeant says that he and
the other officers do not like hav-
ing to arrest people — students or
residents — for drinking offenses.

“Nobody likes to go to jail,
and we don’t really like to take
people to jail,” Miller said. “What
people don’t realize is that when
they drink and it doesn’t look like
they’re going to make it home,
it’s our responsibility to make
sure they get taken care of.”

At 11:00 p.m., Ofﬁcer Leon-
ard Stewart came on duty. Of-
ﬁcer Kesterson’s shift ends at
midnight, leaving just Miller and
Stewart at work. Stewart, who
is also a Lexington native, lives
on Maury Street next door to the
house he grew up in.

Stewart has been in law en-
forcement for 18 years, working
in Northern Virginia, on the VMI
Post Police, and with the Lexing-
ton Police since November.

Just after midnight, the two of-
ficers responded to a noise com-
plaint at McLaughlin and White
Street. Miller knocked on the
apartment door, and told the stu-
dent that if the oﬁicers are called
back a second time, they will
write a summons, and if they are
called back a third time they will
arrest the student.

Shortly after 12:30 a.m., at
the intersection of Tucker and
Massie, Stewart stopped a man
carrying an open can of beer and
a plastic bag full of several un-
opened cans. Stewart leapt out
of his car and asked the man to
stop. After checking the subject’s
ID and making him pour out the
open beer can, Stewart let the
man continue his walk home.

At 12:55 a.m., employees at
the Palms called the police de-
partment because a patron in the
bar appeared to have passed out.
When a Palms employee walked
over to ask if the man needed
help, the man’s wife became an-
gry and refused to leave. The
woman continued to argue with
the employees, promting them to
call the central dispatcher.

When Stewart and Miller ar-
rived, several VMI Keydets had
canied the man out of the Palms

and started taking him home.

Another man waiting outside
the bar then tried to re-enter the
building. The man insisted that
he wanted to come in and started
swearing at the employee in the
doorway. Miller spun around and,
using what he calls his “voice of
authority,” told the man to sit
down and be quiet.

While Miller went into the bar
to make sure things had calmed
down, the man started yelling at
Stewart. When Miller exited the
bar, the two ofﬁcers arrested the
still—shouting man and charged
him with being drunk in public.
They emptied his pockets and
loaded him into the backseat of
Stewart’s squad car. The man
had difficulty getting into the car
and struggled to tell Stewart his
name.

At the jail, Stewart pulled his
car through the barbed wire fence
and then into a small garage which
has a door that locks behind his
car. He took the man inside the
jail, where three jail employees
were waiting. As Stewart ﬁlled
out the necessary paperwork, the
man became increasingly agi-
tated. When two jail guards tried
to remove the necklaces the pris-
oner was wearing (one of them
a St. Christopher’s medallion),
the man had to be physically re-
strained from trying to retrieve
his necklace. Still handcuffed, he
was put in a holding cell where
he could be heard shouting at the
two guards.

Having ﬁnished his trip to jail,
Stewart cruised past what had
been a crowded W&L party at
the intersection of Randolph and
Massie. The time was now 1:30
a.m., and only a few students re-
mained in the house.

Miller, meanwhile, had agreed
to give some of the law gradu-
ates a ride home from the Palms.
One graduate and his ﬁance’ piled
into the back seat of Miller’s un-
marked car and asked if they can
get a ride to Woods Creek. The
graduate initially asked to be
dropped off up the street from his
building but changed his mind
when Miller teased that he was
afraid of his friends seeing him in
a police car.

For next several hours, Miller
and Stewart patrolled the quiet
streets. Only a noise complaint
at 2:50 a.m. broke the silence.
Another night on the Lexington
streets was drawing to a close.

THE RING-TUM PHI - 3

UDIIIIOIIS

 

editor

Onyx. defends administration

Undergraduate black student organization responds to letter that criticized university admissions policies

To the Editor:
The letter submitted from the
Concerned Parent that appeared

‘ in the April 24 issue of the Ring-

tum Phi was most troubling to the
officers of the racially inclusive
undergraduate black student or-

‘ ganization, Onyx.

The highly inﬂammatory letter
calls into question the qualiﬁca-
tions of black and Latino students
attending Washington and Lee.
The administration was also im-
plicated in instituting policies that
the parent believes are “detrimen-
tal to the University.”

The parent raises several times
the question of whether minor-
ity students are given preference
in the admissions process and
whether ﬁnancial incentives are
given to students of color to en-
courage them to attend.

While we do not claim to know
the inner workings of the Admis-
sions Department, we are aware
that the ﬁnancial incentives have
helped to expose Washington and
Lee University to a more diverse
pool of applicants. We can only
surmise that these incentives are
reﬂective of the socio-economic
backgrounds of many of the re-
cipients.

The parent asks to have the
standardized test score data for
the entering freshmen class for
the past ten years broken down by
ethnicity as well as citing statis-
tics that state that black students
score lower on the SAT than white
students.

The parent fails to mention the
score differences that also exist
between male and female students
and students who attended public
school versus private school.

SAT tutoring, coaching and
prep classes, another confound-
ing variable, is an issue not even
taken into consideration by the
parent.

Furthermore, the parent does
not even attempt to offer up a
possible cause to the score dis-
crepancy that may exist.

While Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation of Topeka (1954) may have
prohibited the dejure segregation
of public education facilities, the
truth of the matter is that defacto
segregation still exists.

The educational system con-
tinues to be segregated because
residential segregation continues
to persist as well.

Students largely attend schools
in their neighborhood and as a re-

Student calls for
open administration

To the Editor:

It is nice to see some contro-
versy at Washington and Lee.

I’m referring, of course, to the
Phi’s May 4 issue, which featured
a two—page parade of anti-Con-
cemed Parent letters.

The letters contained a barrage
of claims that I will not be able to
deal with entirely.

There were two broad points
made by students that I will deal
with.

The ﬁrst was that SAT scores
are not enough to measure a stu-
dent. Several reasons are given,
most of them quite reasonable.
Gabe Chapman points out, cor-

The purpose of educa-
tion is to transcend
one is background in or-
der to think objectively,
logically and fairly.

rectly, that rich students have an
inherent advantage on the SAT.
This advantage is not limited to
the SAT and should be taken into
account in all areas of the admis-
sions criteria.

However, the SAT was de-
signed to ensure that the admis-
sions process would not be ar-
bitrary. (See Dinesh D’Souza’s
Illiberal Education, page 44,
where he also notes that “studies
show that the SAT is a fairly reli-
able indicator of college prepara-
tion.”)

We must not seek to undercut
its validity just because we are
unhappy with the results. If it can
be shown objectively (without re-
garding how the scores turn out)
that the SAT is inherently biased,
then we should change it after
careful consideration.

But the SAT continues to be
a successful indicator of poten-
tial for college success, and I
doubt the seriousness of such bias
claims.

The second point is stated best
and most disturbingly by Chap-
man: “Let us reafﬁrm our univer-
sity’s right to compose each class

as it sees ﬁt....” Now it’s not the
university’s power that is in ques-
tion, but rather its integrity. The
university certainly has the right
to admit students unfairly, but
only at the expense of high stan-
dards.

There are those who think
diverse ethnic backgrounds are
essential for any student body be-
cause different backgrounds cre-
ate different perspectives. This
idea may have some merit for
creative work, but not for educa-
tion in general. The purpose of
education is to transcend one’s
background in order to think ob-
jectively, logically and fairly. In
other words, if your perspective is
solely based on your background,
then your education has done you
no good.

Some might respond that edu-
cation is not provided equally
at the high school level and that
therefore college admissions
should respond to this disparity.
This argument has some merit,
but I suspect the disparity exists
between rich and poor rather than
between races.

As I said, I do not have a prob-
lem with taking economics into
account in admissions criteria,
so long as we consider each ap-
plicant as an individual and not
as a potential source of diversity
points.

Now that I have responded to
these broad points, I suppose the
real question is whether our ad-
missions policies are, in fact, ra-
cially biased.

If I am not mistaken, the let-
ter from Concerned Parent was a
request for just that information
that might shed some light on this
issue.

If the administration would
not mind doing more than just as-
serting its own integrity, it might
lay out the relevant statistics that
would prove this parent wrong.

Do I think our admissions pol-
icies are ﬂawed?

I am not sure.

There is one question to con-
sider, given all the common
knowledge about academic per-
formance among different races.

Where are all the Asians?

P. Jameson Graber
Class of 2008

It should be noted that black students rep-
resent only 4 percent of the school, and the

total white, non Hispanic, population only

constitutes 13 percent of the student body.

sult, the school is going to be re-
ﬂective of the racial make up of
the community.

Could the differences in test
scores be a vestige of America’s
highly racist and oppressive past
and indicative of a greater soci-
etal problem, the inequality of
education and life experiences of
black and white youth?

The claim that the black popu-
lation at Washington and Lee has
increased by more than 100 per-
cent in the last decade was found
to be humorous.

For simplicity, let’s round the
number of black students up to
80, from the accurate number of
78; we do not see going from 40
to 80 students out of a population
of almost 1,800 over the course
of ten years as being alarming or
representing a major threat.

It should be noted that black
students represent only 4 percent
of the school, and the total white,
non Hispanic, population only
constitutes 13 percent of the stu-
dent body.

There are only about I00 black
and Hispanic students. Could it
not be possible for Washington
and Lee to ﬁnd 100 “qualiﬁed”
black and Hispanic students of
color in the entire nation?

The parent also says that they
do not believe in helping one
group of people by hurting an-
other group.

Is this implying that the deci-
sion to admit women an example
of helping one group by hurting
another?

Is the decision to admit any
student of color another exam-
ple?

What about admitting more
students from certain states, or
those who are of differing reli-
gious faiths or from various so-
cio-economic backgrounds?

The parent’s usage of the term
“minority” is also problematic.

Although it is widely used to
refer to multicultural groups, a
minority could also be deﬁned
as “a group having little power
or representation relative to other
groups within a society.”

This deﬁnition is reﬂective
of the way that people of color
have been historically treated in
America.

Racism, discrimination and
racial inequality continue to ex-
ist, and continue to affect people
of color in virtually every facet of
life.

We see no problem with hav-
ing race or ethnicity being one of
the many factors taken into con-
sideration with regards to admis-
sion.

It appears that the parent fails
to understand that the college
admissions process is a complex
one.

It can not be reduced to a for-
mula to determine who gains ac-
ceptance and who does not.

Many more students apply
than there is capacity, thus the
Board of Trustees and the Ad-
missions Department determines
which characteristics they would
like to see in potential students.

Test scores do play an impor-
tant part of the application pro-
cess; however, they are most cer-
tainly not the sole component.

The Admissions Department
also takes into consideration ex-
tracurricular activities, the per-
sonal essay, the three letters of
recommendation and the inter-
view to determine eligibility.

It seems that the parent is ad-
vocating that society returns to the
days of yore when people of color
were unable to gain admittance to
institutions of higher learning.

The strides that Washington
and Lee University have taken
need to be commended, not criti-
cized.

The institution has strived to
become more diverse and inclu-
sive, and these efforts should be
respected and applauded.

The lessons of Duke

Why the lacrosse scandal in Durham could easily happen at Washington and Lee

By Jennlfer Sutton
c o L u M N I s T
It sounds like something

straight out of Tom Wolfe’s Bon-
ﬁre of the Vanities: wealth, privi-
lege, strippers, rape (in lieu of
murder) and racial politics.

Durham, N.C., has become
the latest racial platform for race-
mongrels like Al Sharpton and his
cronies to march down to Durham
and hold massive protests.

A racial divide has engulfed a
community, tragedy has occurred
and an entire school is being
blamed for the suspected actions
of a few.

However, all of this is cloud-
ing the bigger issue; if this trag-
edy can happen at Duke, it can
happen anywhere.

Thus, I implore you to think
twice, as enticing as I am sure it
may be, the next time one of your
frat brothers, or the like, suggests
hiring townies from the surround-
ing areas to strip or do something
equally ridiculous. While this may
sound like a ludicrous scenario,
remind yourself what is happen-
ing at Duke.

I have always been a propo-
nent of siding with the victim
in rape cases, but this time the
evidence and circumstances that
have surrounded the Duke la-
crosse scandal appear to have
marred our perception of who is
really at fault.

If the accused are guilty, then
they have desecrated the name of
all Caucasian suburban athletes at
top schools.

If reports are accurate that
an unnamed third player will be
charged, this time with reliable
DNA evidence that links him to
the crime (in this case that the
suspect’s skin tissue may have
been found under the victim’s

Evidence that has surfaced, including time-

lines with receipts, a lack of DNA evidence and

fake nail,) then that individual
should, without a doubt, be held
accountable for his horrendous
actions.

But what if the others accused
are not at fault?

Evidence that has surfaced, in-
cluding time-lines with receipts, a
lack of DNA evidence and prior
false accusations on the part of
the accuser have made us ques-
tion her credibility.

In addition, there appears to be
bias on Prosecutor Nifong’s end,
a man who was just successfully
re-elected, by appealing to the
angry residents of Durham with
a campaign centered on the Duke
case.

But let me be perfectly clear,
my doubt from this case stems
only from surrounding evidence
that has emerged, not from any
sort of elitist racial-bias.

That said, the proﬁle of these
students is eerily familiar: upper-
middle class, Caucasian athletes
hailing from suburban Northeast.

These are individuals who
seem to work hard, at least enough
to gain acceptance to Duke, and
play hard both outside the class-
room and on the ﬁeld.

Does this sound familiar to
you?

It should, aﬁer all, this image
is a classic stereotype of Wash-
ington and Lee and many other
top-schools around the country.

But make no mistake. Given

THE RING-TUM PHI IS A

the right circumstances, this type
of scenario can unfold itself at
W&L or elsewhere.

It can happen to your friend,
your frat brother or anyone else
you know.

Hopefully, we know bet-
ter. Hopefully, we are not crazy
enough to call up local strippers
from neighboring Rockbridge
County (why one would actually
want to do this, is a whole differ-
ent question).

And of course, I’d like to as-
sume that the Honor System
would prevent such a situation
from happening.

Nonetheless, we are not im-
mune. Six percent of the W&L
women interviewed in an anon-
ymous survey said they were
victims of an attempted rape in
2005.

Consequently, if these stu-
dents are guilty, then I hope that
justice will be served and that
these students will pay dearly for
their crime.

However, what if their only
crime was their intoxication and
thereby their inability to make ra-
tional decisions?

In an instance like this, should
inebriation equal automatic guilt?

I’m not claiming to be the
standard for morality, far from it.

However, I have seen both
my friends from school and from
home in precarious situations be-
cause of alcohol.

staffeditorial

In fact, when this story ﬁrst
broke, I immediately thought of
my friends at schools where ath-
letic teams are the equivalent of
fraternities.

These are teams where the
premise of an evening is to get
as a drunk as possible and hit on
random girls.

I have no doubt that these
teams or organizations, either
Greek or athletic, are not impervi-
ous to any-type of alcohol-fueled
debauchery.

Could this tragedy at Duke
have been prevented for all par-
ties?

I would like to think so.

If someone had been sober
enough to either stop what was
going on, or to realize that this
woman, allegedly, arrived shoe-
less and in no state to work, may-
be none of this would have hap-
pened. Maybe someone would
have simply sent the strippers
home.

Instead, these boys, guilty or
not, will be used as a pawns in
larger racial game in Durham for
years to come.

They’re caught at the center of
race, gender, and socio-economic
conﬂicts that were simmering in
Durham long before they arrived
at Duke.

And imagine, it could have all
been prevented if someone, any-
one had the brains to be cognizant
of what was going on.

The moral of this story?

Be aware of your actions,
or at least have friends who are
looking out for you when, and if,
you choose to drink yourself into
oblivion (not that I am advocating
blacking-out).

Maybe then we will decrease
our chances of tragedy occurring
in Lexington.

 

To the Editor:

I just ﬁnished read-
ing the April 24 edi-
tion of the Ring—tum Phi

and am deeply con-
cerned about two edi-
torials. Is Washington

and Lee becoming another
PC Liberal Arts univer-
sity?

If so, then it is not the
school I thought it would
be.

Coming from Cali-
fornia, a land where
anything goes, I wanted a
more “traditional” type of
education for my son.

A highly challeng-
ing approach to educa-
tion with a conserva-

tive student body is
what I thought would be of
great value.

I thought Wash-
ington and

Lee was swathed in tra-
dition and would not be
a follower of political
correctness but a continu-
ing trailblazer for hon-
or and integrity. I was
saddened to read that some
discrimination may exist
through afﬁrmative action.

Does this University
show preferences based on
race?

editor

Just another PC

and Lee University will be
a great disappointment.

I really hope this very re-
spected institution remains
a bastion of “saneness and
integrity” and continues
to have a clear and fo-
cused vision that stresses a

Right of press limited by EC

A public hearing impossible to reach without full freedom of the press

Throughout the centuries,
the general public’s sole defense
against deception has been a free
press.

The United States Constitu-
tion protects it, the population
depends on it, and absolute power
abhors it.

Last week, the Executive
Committee tried to stiﬂe it.

Press coverage of the planned
Student Body Hearing last week
was effectively prohibited by the
EC’s ban of notepads, pens, and
recording devices.

The accused student, found
guilty by the few powerful mem-
bers of the committee in a closed
hearing, found his or her cause
valuable enough to request that
the public decide.

But the public would have

' been shut out.

Lee Chapel only holds 525 stu-
dents, leaving a large majority of
the 2000-plus student population
out of the “community of trust.”

Students are expected to keep
information within the commu-
nity of trust.

Yet most students are denied
membership into this community.

A free press was designed to
solve this problem.

The purpose of newspaper
from the very start has been to
provide public information to
masses.

This information includes
everything that is vital to the
comfortable citizenship of every
member of a society.

A reporter is supposed to be
there when the citizens cannot.

Thomas Jefferson once said

that “our liberty cannot be guard-
ed but by the freedom of the
press.”

How can our liberty be guard-
ed when the majority of the citi-
zens neither know nor understand
the major principles which guide
their everyday life?

The honor system is intended
to be ﬂexible so that it may apply
its standards of gentlemanly con-
duct in a way that has effectively
governed students for over a hun-
dred years.

A key factor in its ﬂexibility is
the ability of the current student
population to make decisions de-
termining the deﬁnition of honor.

If the student population can-
not participate in this decision,
they have been cheated.

Any attempt by the press to
cover an event at which they were
not allowed to take notes would
result in gross inaccuracies.

Any attempt to restrict its cov-
erage would result in a hundred
false rumors.

As information of the hear-
ing slowly leaked from the door-
way of Lee Chapel, it would
pass through campus in whispers
which would grow into screams,
the truth growing into a mistruth
and eventually ending in a com-
plete absence of fact.

The ability of the press to cov-
er such an event would protect the
accused from the damage of these
lies.

The press was closed out of
the hearing, something Chairman
Wheeler Sparks explained as pro-
tection of “fairness of process for
the accused.”

If students cannot make it into Lee Chapel,

how can we maintain the honor system Robert

E. Lee helped found?

 

Did the student not request a
public hearing?

The accused, in accordance
with White Book policy, request-
ed that the facts of the case be
placed before the public in order
to determine and also deﬁne our
standards of honor.

Yet, if the hearing had actually
taken place, less than one quarter
of the “public” could have actu-
ally been present to hear the case.

Is the hearing truly public if
most of the public cannot attend?

Information, when presented
to the public, is determined true
or false by the public market of
ideas.

It is the right of this accused
student to allow the public to de-
cide the truth.

The system is designed with
trust in the community’s sense of
honon

When the community cannot
participate, that trust is violated.

Further, students place trust in
the Executive Committee.

We elect these powerful offi-
cials, but then rarely get to moni-
tor their actions.

A student body hearing is an
important opportunity to evaluate
their performance and worthiness
as leaders.

If less than a quarter of us can

attend, we simply cannot make a

I

complete and thorough evalua- 1

tion.

If students cannot make it into
Lee Chapel, how can we maintain
the honor system Robert E. Lee
helped found?

His inﬂuence, still deeply felt
within the conﬁnes of the Wash-
ington and Lee community, con-
tinues to guide the population and
its governing principles.

Lee said, “Do your duty in all
things. You cannot do more; you
should never wish to do less.”

It is the duty of the Executive
Committee, based on the princi-
ples on which they were elected,
to ensure that the honor system is
justly followed.

Meanwhile, it is the duty of
the press to monitor this govem-
ing body and the citizens ruled by
it.

This action by the press allows
for the fair dissemination of infor-
mation.

The direct result of this infor-
mation is more responsible citi-
zenship, which includes a fair and
truly public trial for the accused.

The EC is allowed to exercise
their duties without censure or
hindrance by the press.

We let you do your job. Please
let us do ours.

Senior Wins teaching award

Joe Franzen plans to use the $4,000 stipend to purchase computers for his middle school classroom

By Stacey Grljalva
surr wrursn

Who couldn’t use an extra
$4,000 after graduation?

One senior, who won that sti-
pend, intends to use the money
not to repay loans or for a car, but
on his middle school kids.

Joseph Franzen plans to teach
in either Kentucky or in Rock-
bridge. He hopes to use the mon-
ey on computers.

“Technology is such a huge
part and is largely utilized in the
classroom ,” he said.

Franzen won the Sarah G. Ball
Teaching Award, which gives the
money to a graduating senior who
will teach in an area with diverse
needs.

The award was named in hon-
or of Sarah Ball, Class of 2001.

Despite being able to spend
the money in any way, all the win-
ners have chosen not to spend the
salary supplement on themselves.
One past winner even used the
money to buy winter coats for her
students.

“Every winner has used the
award to buy things for the class-
room, without exception,” said
Nan Partlett, Director of Teacher
Education.

This year’s winner, in addition
to teaching, will be studying for
his masters and his certiﬁcation.

Partlett said Franzen stood out
from the other applicants because

of his very serious commitment
to teaching and his knowledge of
teaching learned from watching
his mother and grandmother, who
are both teachers.

Franzen was a double major in
American History and Anthropol-
ogy before taking any education
classes.

“I did child care and got deep
into it,” he said. “It just clicked.”

Franzen has been an enrich-
ment tutor and taught in class-
rooms as part of the education
practicum, a chance for W&L
students to actually teach for 60
or 70 hours in one semester.

As the only male sixth grade
teacher, Franzen connected with
some of his male students that
had been labeled as bad boys.

“It’s an adventure,” he said.
“The best part is seeing a change.
I had one student who wasn’t
passing when I started and he
raised it to a low C. He felt like he
could do this.”

In case Franzen is unable to
teach next year, the alternate for
the award is Sarah Weil.

Already certiﬁed, Weil plans
on teaching in Maryland or Penn-
sylvania.

A politics major, Weil decided
to pass on law school in favor of
teaching in an area where she was
needed.

She said, “I wanted to do
something that helps people with-
out charging $150 an hour.”

Sarah Weil’s students employ creative techniques for a project In her practicum classroom. The politics major
decided to forgo law school in order to teach in an underprivlledged area where her skills are needed.

Saving lives one letter at a time

Senior Amanda Dysart organized the W&L chapter of Up ‘Til Dawn and helped to raise thousands of dollars

The W&L community stepped up behind

Dysart’s lead to raise money for children with

cancer at St. Jude’s. By writing 50 letters each,

members of Up ‘Til Dawn made $20,169.49 in

the past year which will help cover the cost of

treating children whose families cannot pay.

By Steph Wlechmann
surr wmrsn

Ben’s father spoke with tears
in his eyes. After losing his
young son to cancer, addressing
a room ﬁill of co1lege—age stu-
dents reminded him of the life
his son would never have.

Yet, the message he brought
was ﬁlll of hope. Without St.
Jude’s Children’s Hospital, he
would not have had as many
years with Ben as he did.

He, like hundreds of thou-
sands of other parents, was
grateful for the research being
done at the unique hospital in
Memphis, Tenn.

“We still need to keep doing
it,” he said.

Within the audience crying
with him was Amanda Dysart.

After her visit to St. Jude’s,
the English major saw the need
to help the facility.

She immediately brought
that passion back to Washington
and Lee.

Dysart started the W&L
chapter of Up ‘Til Dawn, a na-
tional ﬁindraising campaign for
St. Jude’s.

She organized the chapter
this year by working with the
national board, selecting an

 

executive committee at the uni-
versity and recruiting fundrais-
ing participants.

Her efforts helped to raise
$20,169.49 in a matter of
months.

The money raised will pay
for research and treatment of
childhood cancer for families
who cannot pay for care.

All patients at St. Jude’s are
never billed.

Regardless of their ﬁnancial
situation, sick children and their
families can get the help they
need.

Dysart and her fundraising
team did not hold a telethon.
They did not sell chocolate bars
or pizzas. They did not have a
car wash. They simply wrote
letters.

Dysart recruited and orga-
nized 25 teams of students to
ﬁmdraise with a letter—writing

campaign.

Each student gathered the
names of 30 to 50 family mem-
bers and friends and sent out
form letters asking for dona-
tions.

St. Jude’s fonn letters show
the face of childhood cancer.
Abbi, a blue-eyed two-year-old,
stares up from the page, while
a sidebar tells its recipient her
story.

She was diagnosed with
acute myeloid leukemia when
she was ﬁve—months—old.

Even though her parents
could not pay for treatment,
Abbi was taken in by the St.
Jude’s staff and is in remission
today.

As the letter with her picture
and story reminds potential do-
nors, it is ﬁindraising money
that keeps the hospital going.

“Your gift today,” it reads,
“will help pay for the chemo-
therapy, radiation and bone
marrow transplants that save
the lives of these innocent chil-
dren... so they can have the
chance to grow up and go to
college, too.”

Like the family and friends
that donated, Dysart was moved
by the mission of St. Jude’s.
“When I began the project,” she
said, ‘‘I wasn’t so emotionally
invested in it. Then I actually

“You have to be invested in
the cause. You ’ve got to see
your goal and keep going
towards it. ”

went [to St. Jude’s].”

At the hospital, the environ-
ment is entirely different from
clichéd pistachio green walls
and the smell of antiseptic.

Corridors are ﬁlled with
brightly—colored cartoon mu-
rals.

The sounds of video games
echo from a special room for
teenagers. No one over the age
of 19 is allowed in — especially
parents.

Doctors tend to their small
patients in special ways. “They
will draw pictures on kids’ fac-
es when they are having their
MRIs,” said Dysart, “so kids
don’t get freaked out.”

St. Jude’s does not just calm
the children.

Worried parents are also tak-
en care of. Depending on the
length of their stay, parents are
housed in hotels or their own
apartments.

Personal chefs cook dinner
for those with more on their
minds.

There are gyms for exercise,
and the hospital employs pro-
fessional masseuses to knead
stress away.

St. Jude’s also conducts im-
portant research on childhood
cancer, to one day ﬁnd a cure.
And, said Dysart, “they don’t
hide their research. As soon as
they get results, they share it.
So other hospitals can beneﬁt,
too.”

Dysart kneels over a large
banner that lays on the ﬂoor,
which reads “W&L Loves St.
Jude’s.”

GSA opens the closet

Rainbow week is a celebration of tolerance and open—mindedness

The Gay-Straight Alliance has made strides

since its small beginning six years ago. With

acceptance and tolerance as its mission, the

group had instituted several traditions on

campus, including Rainbow Week.

By Stacey Grljalva
STAFF WRITER

The Skittles and drag show
may have been missing but the
Gay-Straight Alliance celebrated
Rainbow Week in full force last
week. .

Events included a showing of
movies, “Hug a Homo” day, and
culminated in the second annual
trip to Roanoke’s gay bar, The
Park.

“Rainbow Week is open to ev-
erybody, even if you’re not a GSA
member,” said GSA’s incoming
president, Stephanie Wiechmann.
“By coming, you learn about us,
we learn about you. Tolerance
doesn’t have one face, it’s not
from the North or South.”

Originally begun as a week-
long celebration of Calvin Awk-
ward’s birthday (May 10), the
GSA has come a long way from
its inception in 2000.

Started by three students with
a mission to change the univer-
sity’s nondiscrimination policy
to include sexual orientation, the
group now focuses on tolerance
and acceptance.

A hallmark of the association’s
work is the voluntary Safe Place
program. Stickers mark the doors
and offices of students, faculty
and staff on campus

“The stickers denote that any-
one can feel conﬁdent to talk to
the person about issues of sexual
orientation and won’t be made
fun of,” said Wiechmann.

The Safe Place program has
also helped faculty and staff to
come out.

Before the program, accord-
ing GSA’s president, no faculty or
staff were openly gay.

On the GSA website, one stu-
dent remembers her ﬁrst GSA
meeting.

She had asked how many un-
dergraduate students were openly
gay. The answer, in 2002, was
zero.

Now, four years later, the num-
ber is eight to ten. The number
varies because some students are
out to only their friends or their
frat or only the GSA.

Matthew Hampton, the out-
going vice president, remembers
coming out in the fall of his fresh-
man year three years ago.

“I fell in love with a guy,” he
said. “He made me feel that it’s
ok. I was ﬁnally proud and will-
ing. I told whoever asked. I didn’t
t:ry to act straight anymore.”

Wiechmann said that, on aver-
age, ten percent of any population
is gay or lesbian.

Even by conservative stan-
dards of four percent, W&L falls
short of normalcy.

Wiechmarm suggested that
there may be more gays on cam-
pus but that they have not come
out yet. Part of the GSA’s mission
is to provide an accepting envi-
ronment.

“Calvin has made being gay
more upbeat and non-threaten-
ing,” she said. “People seek us

out. We don’t presume anyone
is gay or straight. We presume a
blank sexual orientation until we
are told.”

Members of the alliance do
not have to be gay or lesbian to
join. In fact, Wiechmarm said that
80 to 90 percent of the group is
straight.

The support has made a differ-
ence for Hampton.

He said he has gone from con-
sidering transferring his freshman
year to not even thinking about his
sexuality being an issue because
everyone has been so accepting.

Hampton thinks that the differ-
ence has come from how people
view him.

“I ﬁt into the stereotype [of
W&L] but I just happen to be
gay,” he said. “People saw me as
Matthew, not that gay freshman.
Sexual orientation is just a small
part of who you are. ”

Hampton said that Awkward’s
strong leadership as a gay man
has helped to make the GSA a
strong presence on campus.

The GSA wants people to
know who they are and what they

are about without being pushy.

Their events are about vis-
ibility without being offensive.
Hampton said they are not re-
cruiting gay members or even
about activism.

“If gay students are not out be-
cause they feel the environment is
not conducive, then I have a prob-
lem with that,” said Hampton.
“No one should have to suffer the
way that people in the closet suf-
fer.”

“If that’s not the case, then I
don’t have a problem with a small
number of out students.”

In the undergraduate cata-
logue, the group is classiﬁed un-
der multicultural associations.

“We work for tolerance of the
minority by the majority,” said
Wiechmann. “So we are consid-
ered by the university as multi-
cultural.”

The GSA may have come a
long way from its beginnings six
years ago, but its presence is still
necessary.

“There isn’t another group that
deals with tolerance of sexual ori-
entation.”’

A riot of song and dance
will debut in the Keller
Theatre this weekend as
“The Pirates of Penzance,”
a Gilbert and Sullivan
comic opera, is performed
by W&L students.

The opera, according
to the theatre department’s

ous farce of sentimental pi-
rates, bumbling policemen,
dim—witted young lovers,
dewy-eyed daughters and
an eccentric Major-Gener-
al, all morally bound to the
often-ridiculous dictates of
honor and duty.”

“It’s really going to be
a high quality production,”
said Julie Petersen, one of
the cast members.

The approximately 30
cast members have been
practicing since the begin-
ning of winter term.

John Henderson, an-
other cast member, said
the cast started learning the
music for the show ﬁrst.

The practices were only
once a week, he said, but
when spring term started
the cast upped their prac-
tices to three hours a night,
six to seven days a week.

“It’s deﬁnitely been a lot
of work,” he said. “But it’s
been a lot of fun. Every-
one is having a great time
and we’re all committed to
the production.”

“We have rehearsal all
the time,” said Petersen,

 

Comic opera performed at Lenfest

website, “spins an hilari- ,

“but it’s worth it.”

Kenny Kraft and Lisa
Zevorich play the leads
in the production. Kraft
plays Frederic, a man that
has been mistakenly ap-
prenticed to a band of pi-
rates instead of a pilot.

“Kraft is actually pretty
good,” said stage director
Paten Hughes. “He has a
lot of charisma and has
probably grown the most
in his role.”

“You hear him in SoC0,”
said Petersen, “but I never
appreciated how amazing
of a voice he had.”

Zevorich plays Mabel,
the daughter of a Major-
General, who falls in love
with Frederic only to be
hampered by his father and
his disapproval of Freder-
ic’s status as a pirate.

“She has an amazing
voice,” said Hughes. “It’s
absolutely gorgeous. I
don’t know how she does
it.”

After a series of hu-
morous events, the pirates
must endure a battle with
a police force. The victors
of the ﬁght help to deter-
mine the fate of Frederic
and Mabel.

So do the lovers reunite
at the end of the opera or
are they doomed to lead
separate lives because of
Frederic’s occupation?

To ﬁnd out, go see the
production.

It will run from Friday,
May 19 through Monday,
May 22.

1e Patisserie

With students bored with cam-

variety.

Look no further than The Pa-

newest addition to its somewhat
limited selection of eateries. The
restaurant is open weekdays and

The owner and manager,
Kayla Finlay, along with The
Patisserie’s chef, Pennie Griﬂin
and baker, Higgins Stewart, were
former employees of Foods Inter-
national.

When this establishment
closed, these enterprising individ-
uals used their experience from
Foods International to create The
Patisserie. Finlay noticed that a
niche existed in the local mar-
ket for gourmet foods and baked
goods and fashioned the restau-
rant’s menu accordingly.

The Patisserie provides a wide

blanche and the selection changes
slightly everyday, the restaurant
always offers some basic items.
Turkey and roast beef sandwich-
es, as well as spinach and Greek
salads are typically available pre-
prepared.

Additionally, The Patisserie al-
ways offers two soups, both made
from scratch, one vegetarian.

Since the entrees are prepared
in advance, the longest a custom-
er will ever wait is two to three
minutes for their order.

Not only is this gourmet food
available quickly, but the prices
are reasonable. Sandwiches vary

between $4.95 and $7.95 and en-
trees prices range from $7.95 to
$12.95.

Of course, we cannot forget
about desserts.

The Patisserie offers a mouth-
watering array of treats, including
everything from traditional cin-
namon buns to baklava to ﬁlled
French croissants.

If you have the time, you can
savor your sweet in the comfort-
able, intimate environment while
surfing the Internet, since The Pa-
tisserie provides wireless Internet
on the premise.

Although The Patisserie does

not advertise heavily, its reputa-
tion has spreadimpressively sim-
ply by word of mouth.

Finlay reports that the restau-
rant has been serving 15 to 30
new customers every day since its
opening.

The atmosphere of The Patis-
serie is appropriate for a quick
bite or for an extended meal.

While The Patisserie may be
located in a rather unlikely place,
an old bowling alley that had to
be renovated and redesigned, this
little establishment is ﬂourish-
ing on the quality of its cuisine

Where the Buffalo roam

Bands from across the country will travel to the Buffalo Creek music festival to entertain the community

By Madeline Gent
su F r: w a IT 2 R

As spring term comes to a
close, the annual Washington
and Lee tradition of the Buffalo
Creek music festival kicks into
high gear.

This year’s festival includes
nine bands--four of which will
play on Friday and ﬁve on Sat-
urday.

Because of the recent ex-
plosion of the intemet web-
site Myspace, almost all the
band’s information as well as

online, in the Buffalo
Commons Creek follows
and can be on the footsteps
bought at the of Derby Days,
event Foxﬁelds and
tubing down

the Maury, as something every
student goes to at least once if
not each of the four years.

The festival has a great selec-
tion of music that is sure to tap
into a variety of musical tastes.

Playing Friday is Tom Ham-
ilton’s American Babies, Steel
Train, Brothers Past and Quag-
mire Swim Team. Brothers Past
is the Friday night headliner.

They come into the show af-
ter ending their year-long tour.
This summer their focus is on
special events, Buffalo Creek
being one of them.

“We’re going into summer

and just really working on new
material so special events are
last push for our album.” said
the band.

“Buffalo Creek has always
been a good ﬁt for us... Not
many things set up that we’re
tied to a university except
Washington and Lee and The
University of Vermont. We’ve
had tremendous time here last
two years and a good fan base.”

After playing here, Broth-
ers Past will go on to play
much larger music festivals like
Summer Camp, Wakarusa and
Bonnaroo.

This year will mark the
band’s third trip to Buffalo
Creek. Since then they have
found their amount of fans,
praise and coverage growing.

Glide Magazine wrote,
“Brothers Past focuses on the
art of songwriting in a unique
way that sets them apart from
the pack. When you combine
strong, well-written catchy
songs... with electronica laden
powerhouses... you get a de-
tailed glimpse into the future of
music.”

They play from 11:00 p.m.-
l:00 am. on Friday night.
Brothers Past manager Pete
Nicolosi calls the bands music
style describes the typical fan
as“anybody who likes live mu-
sic that might not typically be
heard on top 40.”

Nicolosi is also the manager
for the band playing the Friday
night Gazebo set 7:30 p.m.- 8:30
p.m., Tom Hamilton’s American
Babies.

The honor system
and alcoholism

Students who planned to pre-game the
trial have no respect for honor system

By Tim Llvlngston
surr warren

Last week many students
looked forward to witnessing the
ﬁrst honor trial at Washington and
Lee in years.

While some of the eager spec-
tators wished to behold a pivotal
moment in our school’s history
as well as a vital event in
the life of a student,
others had other mo-
tives to attend the
trial.

As rumors cir-
culated at the details
of the crime, several
individuals planned on
pre-gaming and going to
the hearing intoxicated.

As excitement grew at the
prospect of watching the accused
student on trial, I saw several
weaknesses within the structure
of our community of honor.

Immediately after every mem-
ber of the student body received
the email, few conversations
around our gossip-obsessed cam-
pus consisted of topics besides
the intricacies of the trial.

In theory, the student body
should attend the trial because of
an undying need to preserve the
sacred honor system our school
was built upon.

However, many of the students
who planned on going to the hear-
ing wanted to equate the experi-
ence to a college football game by
putting ten brews in their system
to make the rare occurrence truly
enjoyable.

Were these students making a
mockery of the honor system? Or
were the people who planned on
attending drunk simply epitomiz-
ing the average W&L student who
has to be inebriated in order to be
in a room with more than ﬁve fel-

low students?

Truthfully, I believe the reac-
tion of the student body demon-
strated a common belief in the
lack of importance the honor sys-
tem plays in everyday life.

For many students, the honor
system means virtually nothing
unless they are taking a test or
writing a paper.

The fact that people wanted

to attend Lee Chapel un-

der the inﬂuence re-

veals a truth that the

honor system plays

an increasingly

small role in stu-

dent’s lives as their

careers progress.

Aﬁer the ﬁrst

speech freshman year

when the EC president tells

all those who don’t believe they

can abide by the honor system to

“leave now,” freshman consider
the regulations sacred.

Yet, as time progresses, honor
fades in importance like the obli-
gation people feel when adhering
to the speaking tradition.

For many, the honor system
by the end of sophomore year is
merely a reason not to cheat, lie or
steal and be forced to submit to the
humiliation of the student who be-
came the laughingstock of W&L
before his or her tragic exit.

Students wanted to pre-game
the hearing because they could
not care less about the fate of the
indicted.

Why not get drunk to witness
a student face humiliation for
possibly breaking the hallowed
system? He or she made the criti-
cal mistake and many felt she de-
served embarrassment.

The question of what the hon-
or system really means to a major-
ity of the student body remains: is
it a way to govern one’s life, or a
way not to get expelled?

“Frankly the band would like
anyone who is a music lover,
who enjoys music, who likes
to dance, [and] who likes good
songwriting. We play music
with songs that have not such
silly lyrics but those that reso-
nate with people. People who
rock out,” said Nicolosi.

For anyone else who needs
more convincing they should
come out and watch Brothers
Past, the New York Press called
the band, “the square-jawed,
bastard child of Pink Floyd with
a gigantic stage show.”

Buffalo Creek and the band
have developed a good relation-
ship over the past years.

The Brothers Past plan on re-
turning as long as they are want-
ed. “We’re loyal to the people
who followed us when we were
a smaller band.”

The vibe, weather and fans
have worked together in the past
to create a great set that a true
music fan will not want to miss.

Saturday will not disap-
point either as Mayhem String
Band, Steam Powered Airplane,
Hackensaw Boys, The Pnuma
Trio and Perpetual Groove play
throughout the day.

The Pavilion Headliner is
Perpetual Groove playing from
10:00 p.m.- 2:00 a.m.

Perpetual Groove, like Broth-
ers Past, is hitting up the musi-
cal festival scene this summer.

Along with Buffalo Creek
they will be playing at Wakarusa
as well as 10,000 Lakes Music
Fest, JamCruise and moe.down

“As I awoke on Saturday, my
ﬁrst thought was of who would

blowing my head off tonight.
That honor went to the touring
juggernaut known as Perpetual

writer Brian Bavosa in his re-
view of New York City’s ﬁrst

N.’ GRA

annual Green Apple Music Fes-
tival.

The band was “the last spot
and summed up the week nice-
ly... (and) had my tired bones
boogying.” “

Another band taking the stage
on Saturday for the Pavilion set
from 7:30 p.m.- 9:30 p.m. is the
Pnuma Trio.

They too are making the
rounds this summer and can
again be found at Wakarusa as
well as Smilefest and Summer
Camp.

The band is only a year old

and claims,\/irginia as its home..

.“Described as a sound com-

bining dance music with tra-
ditional jazz driven by funk
sensibilities, the band is taking
multiple scenes by storm,” said
the bands site.

Whether you go to listen to
music, burn an old couch or sit
in a creek all day, Buffalo Creek
proves to be another tradition
among traditions here at W&L.

It gives the students access
to both lesser and better known
bands creating a way for ev-
eryone to expand their musical
palettes.

The festival is open to every-
one and always proves to be a
good time.

Sigma Phi Epsilon sponsors charity tournament

Nine teams participated on Saturday in a three-on-three basketball tourna-
ment, earning over $300 in cash donations to support Wounded Warriors, an
organization assisting injured soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. “After 9/11,

I was very temped to join the military, but instead I went to college,” sopho-
more Thadeous Larkin said. “This is my way of giving back a little bit.” He also
said the fraternity dedicated the event to his high school friend, Eli, who died
in Iraq two weeks ago. Tournament champions, freshmen Ryan Owens, Chris
McHugh and Craig Sauers donated their prize money to the cause.

Alternate athletics actively welcome new members

Washington and Lee offers a host of oppor-

tunites in the realm of club sports including

sailing, boxing, martial arts, table tennis, soccer

and softball. W&L club teams compete against

Varsity and club organizations at other colleges

state—wide. These activities are open to all un-

dergraduate and law students.

Washington and Lee’s Fenc-
ing Club is wrapping up a suc-
cessful season under new coach
and professor Daniel Turkeltaub.
The team has 30-40 members and
continues to grow.

“The Washington and Lee
Fencing Club has doubled in num-
bers since my freshman year, both
in membership and the number of
people attending practices,” ju-
nior captain Alejandro Selin said.

The club practices year-round:
three weekdays, for two hours,
and on Saturday for bouting prac-
tice. It also participates in several
tournaments with colleges such as
Hollins, Virginia Military Institute
and University of Virginia.

According to Selin, “W&L
has never failed to achieve ﬁrst
or second place in intercollegiate
tournaments.”

According to freshman mem-
ber Sean Hurdiss, it is not only a

good physical workout but a men-
tal one as well.

“Fencing has been called
physical chess because it requires
a sharp mind and well-trained
body,” he said.

While some students have
joined with prior experience, the
team welcomes all newcomers.

Since the end of winter term,
the W&L’s Club Women’s La-
crosse team has been practicing.
Fifteen girls are participating, and
the team encourages newcomers
to come out.

Freshman swimmer Amber
Butyn recently joined the team
having little previous experience.

“It’s cool to broaden my inter-
ests and learn a new sport,” she
said.

The girls practice twice a
week, for an hour and a half each
time. A typical practice includes
drills, sprints and scrimmaging.

Due to weather complications,
the team has yet to show its skills.
The tournament in District of Co-

lumbia the women were sched-
uled to play in was cancelled due
to thunderstorms. With the season
concluding, lacrosse player Alden
Wicker said she hopes it turns out
better next year.

WATER POLO

The W&L Club Water Polo
team has struggled to maintain a
regular practice schedule this sea-
son and has yet to compete in an
official match.

Currently, the team consists
of 10 to 12 members. The team is
open to both men and women and
is comprised largely of varsity
swimmers.

Practices are scheduled Mon-
days, Wednesdays and Thursdays
from 5:15 p.m.-6:15 p.m.

According to sophomore mem-
ber Ben Jaskiewicz, he is trying to
get the team more organized.

He also said head coach Joel
Shinoﬁeld is in the process of
organizing a tournament with
James Madison University next
fall before the swim season com-
mences.

Jaskiewicz formed a club team
with one of his friends as a junior
in high school. He also played as
a freshman in college last year in
California.

“It’s a fun sport,” he said.
“That’s why I went to Califomia-
to play polo. It’s a team sport like
baseball, but at the same time, it’s
agressive like football or rugby.”

The team welcomes any new
interest. Previous experience is
not required.

on national rank. The top 32
singles players in the nation are
invited along with the top 16
doubles teams. Applegate and
McClung along with Tabb and
Wortham will represent W&L on
Saturday in doubles play. Apple-
gate and Tabb each earned a spot
in singles as well.

Wortham, who will compete in
both team and individual competi-
tion said she is trying not to focus
too much on upcoming matches.

“I’m taking it one match at a
time,” she said. “I don’t want to
look ahead. This is why you prac-
tice hard. This is why you play
hard. This is why we compete.
This is why I play, for opportuni-
ties like these.”

The Generals, currently unde-
feated (26-0), will meet their ﬁrst
opponent, ninth ranked Williams
(14-6), Wednesday at 9:30 a.m.
at the University of California,
Santa Cruz. If the women defeat
Williams, they will play either
Claremont-Scripps-Mudd Col-
lege (18-3) or DePauw University
(24-1) in the semiﬁnals on Thurs-
day. Emory University ( 1 6-6) won
the title last year and are currently
ranked ﬁfth. Trinity University of
Texas (19-3) may prove to be the
ﬁercest competition, ranked sec-
ond in the nation.

Tabb said one of the most
greatest inﬂuences to bring home
the title is each player’s commit-
ment to the team.

“I think this year especially,
we’ve done a fabulous job at step-
ping up,” she said. “I think this is
our year to step up in the ﬁnals
and play hard and ﬁnally win it.
This is our time.”

Playoff drive cut short

Women ’s lacrosse ends promising crusade Saturday with fall to Lions

By Madeline Gent
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee wom-
en’s lacrosse team ended its best
season to date with a 16-6 loss
to The College of New Jersey in
second round play of the NCAA
Division III Championships.

The team ended with its high-
est overall record of 16-4.

The Generals began their play
in the NCAA tournament with a
19-9 victory over the Christopher
Newport Lady Captains in the
ﬁrst round on Watt Field.

Senior captains Amanda
Strickler and Kate Lester and
junior Kelly Evans scored three
goals apiece. Sophomore goalie
Sarah Tilbor recorded 13 saves,
but it was Strickler’s performance

that stood out most in the match
up. On top of her three goals, she
recorded four assists.

“It was our last home game,
and we really wanted to win for
our seniors... It was also the ﬁrst
time that [the Lady Captains] had
made it into the NCAA playoffs,
so they didn’t know what to ex-
pect. We wanted to show them
what it was all about,” said junior
midﬁelder Mallory Lobisser. She
ﬁnished the game with one goal.

The momentum of their victo-
ry over the Lady Captains did not
prove enough to tackle the The
College of New Jersey in Salis-
bury, Md., on Saturday.

The Lions entered with a nine-
game win streak, 12 previous
NCAA Division III championship
titles and 22 previous tournament

appearances.

Sophomore midﬁelder Megan
Slosson led the Generals’ ﬁrst
half performance with two goals.
Despite her performance, the
Generals found themselves on the
bottom half of the 5-2 score going
into the break.

The Generals were optimis-
tic at the start of the second half,
but were hit hard when Tilbor
received a yellow card. Fresh-
man goalie Ali Hillyard had to
step into goal lacking the experi-
ence of Tilbor. To that point, she
had faced 282 shots. In the seven
games Hillyard played, she faced
only 38 shots. Hillyard recorded
two saves in her 14:27 of play.

The Lions outscored the Gen-
erals 11-4 in the second half.
They were led by senior midﬁeld-

ers Bridget Bigley and Lauren
Dougher, scoring two goals each.
Bigley also had three assists as
her nine-point performance ranks
ﬁfth all-time for single—game
point totals. Dougher adds her six
goals to a total of 41 in touma-
ment play, which ranks fourth for
the most goals scored in NCAA
tournament action.

“Our defense played re-
ally well. We tried to shut down
Dougher, but they had shots we
weren’t prepared for and couldn’t
defend,” Lobisser said.

Freshman Kelsi Robinson ﬁn-
ished the game with two goals.
Strickler had two assists.

“Our ﬁve seniors played their
hearts out, but they just ﬁnished
a lot better than we did,” Lobisser
said.

Seven women leave for Cali-
fornia today with a chance to make
history for the ,Washington and
Lee women’s tennis team. Cruis-
ing through the ﬁrst two rounds
of Nationals held last weekend
at home, these women hope to
clinch the title that has eluded
them for the past two years.

Freshman Katie Tabb was re-
cently declared Atlantic South
Rookie of the Year with a singles
record of 23-5 and a doubles re-
cord of 24-5. She said the team’s
main motivation is its commit-
ment to one another.

“We know we can depend on
one another,” she said. “We all
know we are committed and seri-
ous. I think that’s really important
for doing well, knowing that your
team mates are there and working
just as hard as you.”

Last Saturday, the Generals de-
feated Mary Washington, ranked
twenty—ﬁrst in the nation, 5-0. An
identical performance Sunday
versus number 12 Carnegie Mel-
lon left nothing but hunger in the
hearts of these women.

Saturday, decisive wins from
juniors Emily Applegate and
Kristen McClung, Tabb and ju-
nior Ginny Wortham and senior
Lisa Mabry and sophomore Leah
Weston in doubles placed the
Generals on top going into the
singles matches. Applegate and
Tabb handled their opponents
with ease, securing victory over

Mary Washington.

On Sunday, Applegate and
McClung played number one
doubles, defeating their CMU op-
ponents 8-6. Tabb and Wortham
followed in number two doubles
with a duplicate score. Compet-
ing in number three doubles,
Weston and Mabry tripled the
success with a score of 8-4. In
singles competition, Applegate
and Weston cleared the courts
with their victories over their
CMU contenders guaranteeing a
plane ticket to Santa Cruz for the
next rounds of Nationals.

Tabb said coach Cinda Rankin
was collected as she led the team
to victory.

“I think Cinda was actually a
little nervous, but she did a good
job not showing it,” she said.
“She was not overconﬁdent, but
she wanted us to be comfortable
and ready to play going into the
ﬁrst couple of rounds.”

Nationals is divided into two
competitions: team and individ-
ual. The ﬁrst, beginning Wednes-
day, will determine each school’s
national standing. The second
tournament begins Saturday to
establish individual status. Apple-
gate, Tabb, Wortham, McClung,
Weston and sophomores Rebecca
Timmis and Kelly Will com-
pete in the quarterﬁnals opening
Wednesday.

Four Generals were chosen
to participate in the individual
tournament. Selection is based

Trustee discusses

university finances
John Farmer, Chairman of the
Trustees’ Finance Committee,
met with the W&L community
May 15 to discuss the univer-
sity’s ﬁnancial status. Farmer
reported that the university has
a $106 million operating bud-
get, an endowment worth $532
million and a $117 million debt.
Trusts controlled by outside
parties add another $248 mil-
lion to the endowment. Farmer
said W&L must continue to
grow the endowment to ensure
ﬁnancial stability. The cost of
ﬁnancial aid has risen sharply
in the last decade and a strong
endowment will also be needed
when the school embarks on

its next large building proj-
ects. Farmer said the school ’s
endowment was below the
average endowment of other
top liberal arts colleges but that
the university is still in strong
ﬁnancial shape.

 

   



Phi Gamma Delta
receives second

strike

The IFC has issued a second
strike to the Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity. The house will be
on social probation until Sept.
21, 2006 and will have two
strikes until Nov. 14, 2006.

As part of the social proba-
tion, no more than one-third

of fraternity members can
assemble in any location except
university sponsored events.
Furthermore, all gatherings at
the fraternity house other than
meals and chapter meetings are
not allowed during the social
probation.

The strike [was issued because
of a party held at the frater-
nity house on Monday, May 1.
Should the house receive a third
strike, a mandatory full year
suspension would result. Other
consequences of a third strike
are mandatory alcohol and drug
education and other penalties
determined by the Student Af-
fairs Committee.

City sets dam laws

Lexington council approves ‘No T respassing ’signsfor dam at Jordan is Point

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS smron

One month after 16-year-old
Lexington resident Charles Volpe
drowned in the Maury River, the
Lexington City Council voted on
Thursday, May 18 to post ‘No
Trespassing’ signs at the Jordan’s
Point dam.

Volpe drowned on Saturday,
April 23 when he was swept over
the dam by the swift current.
Pinned underneath the dam by the

water, which was two and a half '

times higher than normal, he was
unable to swim to safety.

The new regulation will not
prohibit swimming in the Maury
near Jordan’s Point, but it will
forbid people from climbing onto
the dam at any time.

The city may also post Wam-
ing signs reminding swimmers
about the dangers of swimming in
the river.

Research by City Manager Jon
Ellestad and his staff discovered
that the dam has been owned by
the city of Lexington since 1940,
giving them the legal authority to
post the ‘No Trespassing’ signs.
Jordan’s Point Park and the Mau-
ry River sit on the boundary be-
tween Lexington and surrounding
Rockbridge County.

At the May 4 City Council
meeting, Mayor John Knapp re-
ported that several citizens had
called him to enquire about safety
around Jordan’s Point, so the
Council authorized the Physical
Services Committee-—chaired by
Councilman Jim Giarminy, to pre-
pare some proposals for the issue.
Ellestad told the committee that
while Volpe was not jumping off
the dam the day he drowned, the
practice of dam jumping — swim-
ming downstream to the top of
the dam, then standing up and
leaping into the chuming water
below — has become increasingly
prevalent in recent years.

Formerly the site of a waste-
water and sewage plant, Jordan’s
Point has become increasingly
popular, especially with teenag-
ers, since the plant was removed

A man ﬁshes below the Maury River dam at Jordan’s Point. A 16-year-old drowned below the dam last month.

and the area became a park.

Ellestad said that. both. he and
Lieutenant Steve Crowder, who
handled the Lexington Police
Department’s investigation of the
incident, were unaware that peo-
ple were jumping off the dam on
a regular basis.

The Physical Services com-
mittee came to the consensus
that swimming in the river was
not exceptionally dangerous, so
it decided not to recommend to-
tally forbidding any swimming at
Jordan’s Point. Ellestad said that
he and the police department also
did not think a complete ban on
swimming could be realistically
enforced.

Gianniny expressed aesthetic

., concerns, saying that he wants the

new signs to try and blend in with
the natural environment. He sug-
gested putting up wooden signs at
the site, but the other committee
members favored placing cheaper
metal signs that would be easier
to replace if damaged or stolen.

Some council members fa-
vored the idea of installing a nicer
wooden sign if the metal one is
not damaged or stolen for several
months.

Gianniny also broached the
idea of putting the signs near the
parking lot instead of next to the
river, but Councilwoman Mimi
Elrod said that she did not think

people would notice signs that far
from the «river.

Ellestad will now work with
David Woody, Director of Lex-
ington’s Public Works Depart-
ment, to determine the best loca-
tion for the new signs. He said
that the ideal place for the signs
would be directly on the dam but
that they could not be placed there
because they would quickly wash
away.

The committee also addressed
issues surrounding the city’s li-
ability at the site. Ellestad said
that if ‘No Trespassing’ signs
are put up then the city must do
a reasonable job of enforcing
the regulations. Since the park

lies on the line between city and
country jurisdictions, several
council members suggested that
the Rockbridge County Sheriff ’s
Department be asked to assist
with enforcing the ban on dam
jumping.

After several more minutes of
discussion, the City Council ap-
proved the placement of the ‘No
Trespassing’ signs by a unani-
mous vote.

With the measure ofﬁcially ap-
proved, Ellestad said he hoped to
install the news signs quickly.

“We hope to have the new
signs up within a week. l’l1 work
with David Woody to pick the
best location for them.”

Chief retires aft

Bruce M. Beard hands in his badge after long
career as chief of the Lexington Police Department

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS EDlT0 R

Thirty-six years after ﬁrst pin-
ning on the badge of a Lexington
police oﬂicer, Chief Bruce M.
Beard is headed for retirement.

Beard, who announced his re-
tirement last fall, will officially
leave the force on July 1. Lieu-
tenant Steve Crowder, a Lexing-
ton police officer since 1982, has
already been appointed to replace
Beard.

During his time on the force,
Beard helped the department
grow into a truly professional
force. The department received
state accreditation in 1998 and
was reaccredited in 2003.

City Manager Jon Ellestad,
who oversees the department, said
Lexington Police Department was
Virginia’s ﬁrst small police depart-
ment to receive accreditation and
for several years was the smallest
accredited department in Virginia.
Over 200 state standards must be
met for a department to receive
accreditation.

Beard said a lot of things, es-
pecially training for new oﬂicers,
have changed since he joined the
department in 1970. A Rock-

bridge County native who was
born in Collierstown, Beard has
never worked as an ofﬁcer in any
city other than Lexington.

“They pretty much gave me a
gun and a badge and put me with
a senior officer for about four
weeks,” Beard said. “That was
the extent of the training. In 1972
the state decided that all ofﬁcers
should have some training, so in
January I went up to Blue Ridge
Community College for four
weeks of training. Now ofﬁcers
take a 22 week course at a police
academy down in Salem.”

Beard, who graduated from
high school in 1962, worked at the
Bonded Fibers factory in Buena
Vista from 1962-1970, except for
a stint in the United States Army
from 1965-1967.

‘‘In 1965 I was drafted into the
Army and spent a tour in Vietnam.
I was with the 15‘ Air Cavalry Di-
vision as a helicopter mechanic. I
worked on CH—47 Chinooks.”

Beard said he had considered
going into police work after high
school but ended up going to
work for Bonded Fibers.

During his 36 years with the
department, Beard says he thinks
the police force has moved from

being a reactive police depart-
ment to a proactive one.

Ellestad said Beard had been a
stabilizing leader for the depart-
ment.

“He took over at a time of
great controversy — during the
early ’80s we had a theft scandal
— but he’s always looked at as an
honest individual.”

Ellestad went on to say that
Beard has built and maintained
excellent relationships around the
community.

“One of the biggest changes
he made was the establishment of
a Neighborhood Watch in the Di-
amond Hill and Green Hill neigh-
borhoods,” Ellestad said.

Lieutenant Crowder said
Beard’s personal integrity carried
over into the entire department.

“We’re the team to beat,”
Crowder said. “We’re looked up
to even though we’re a small de-
partment.”

Crowder will inherit a de-
partment that has seen extensive
turnover in the last 18 months.
“The ﬂipside to having no tum-
over for nine years is that retire-
ments all hit at once in the last 18
months. By the end of this year,
we’ll have lost all of our upper

r 36 years

level management except me,
[Sergeant] Bucky Miller and Fred
Smith, who’s been a patrol officer

here for a long time.”

The incoming chief 1 started
his law enforcement career in
1975 and has served in Lexington
and Clifton Forge, Va. Crowder
joined the Lexington department
in 1982, a time when the force had
too few officers.

“That’s when we were re-
ally short-handed,” Crowder said.
“We were working eight to 12
hour shifts seven days a week.”
After being promoted to sergeant
in 1984, Crowder was promoted to
lieutenant when Beard advanced
from lieutenant to chief in 1987.

“He’s eminently qualiﬁed,”
Ellestad said, “and the only one
in the department with command
experience, and I wanted to stay
inside the department because
we’ve had a great deal of tum-
over, losing all of our sergeants
but Bucky Miller in the last three
years. We lost lots of institutional
memory.”

Crowder and Ellestad said one
the department’s current challeng-
es will be ﬁlling the holes created
by the numerous retirements.

“Replacing the experience
will be tough,” Crowder said.
“Over 150 years worth has been
lost. We’ve tried to hire ofﬁcers
with law enforcement experience
and have had some success do-
ing that. but our recent applicant

pool is down to four officers and
none have any experience. It can
take more than six months to train
them, and between training and
equipment it’s a $50,000 invest-
ment even before they take their
ﬁrst solo patrol.”

Crowder said that the depart-
ment would probably not see
many changes after his tenure be-
gan, though he did emphasize that
he wants to stress strong commu-
nity relations.

“It’s important to go back to
the basics of seeing a police of-
ﬁcer outside of the patrol car.
The chief in a small town should
be publicly known, so it won’t
be uncommon to see me walk-
ing around the streets, going into
businesses to talk with people and
check on their needs.”

Beard said that Crowder and
Lexington’s other ofﬁcers will
continue to build and maintain
strong relationships with the
schools, students and citizens of
Lexington.

He said that while the city will
never be crime free, a continuing
challenge for the department will
be to keep the crime rate at its
current low levels.

Lexington’s long-time chief
said he’s enjoyed his 36 year ca-
reer with the police department.

“Even from the ﬁrst day until
retirement day l’ve enjoyed work-
ing with the public. I feel good
when I’m able to help people.”

It saves the rescue
squad a trip

Robert Moses, age 73, was
found lying in the road on
Spotswood Drive on Thurs-
day, May ll. Moses was
discovered near the Lexing-
ton Rescue Squad Building.
Squad members discovered
he had a large cut and a
bump on the left side of his
head, so Moses was taken to
the Stonewall Jackson Hos-
pital Emergency Room and

received treatment for his
head injury. Officers on the
scene determined that Moses
was demonstrating signs of
intoxication and arrested
him, charging him with pub-
lic intoxication.

Main Street, USA
Philip Harris, a 28-year-old
from Lewisburg, W.Va., was
also arrested on May 11 and
charged with public intoxi-
cation. Oﬂicer Fred Smith,
who made the arrest at the
intersection of Main Street
and Washington Street,
stated in his report that Har-
ris was showing signs of
intoxication as he walked.
The arrest occurred at ap-
proximately 10:00 p.m.

Nowhere to run
Lexington resident Anthony
Stewart was charged with
speeding, driving with a

revoked license and obstruc-
tion of justice on Friday,
May 12. Stewart, who was
originally clocked going 39
mph in a 25 mph zone on
Maury Street, pulled into

a driveway on Maury and
began to run away from the
ofﬁcers. Sergeant Mike
Frost, who had originally
tried to stop Stewart, was
unable to catch up with the
27-year-old man. Officer
Nathan Kesterson arrived to
assist Frost, and the two of-
ﬁcers found a witness who
had seen Stewart run by.
Stewart’s father brought his
son to the police station and
turned him in.

Angry at the Palms
John Hefferin, a cell phone
tower worker from Franklin-
ville, NC, was arrested at

l a.m. on Sunday, May

14. Hefferin was at the

Palms Saturday night and
was waiting outside for a
ride when Sergeant Bucky
Miller and Oﬂicer Leonard
Stewart arrived at the bar.
The two Lexington police
officers were responding to
a call from Palms’ employ-
ees that reported patrons
were refusing to leave the
bar. While Miller was
standing in the doorway of
the bar, Hefferin decided
he wanted to re-enter the
premises. An employee
told him that he could not,
so Hefferin began berating
the female employee and
Miller. After Stewart’s ar-
rival, Miller went into the
Palms to make sure the
disruptive patrons had left.
When he went back outside,
Hefferin was arguing with
Stewart. The two ofﬁcers
arrested Hefferin on charges
of being drunk in public.

 Powell says goodbye to campus

Assistant director of student activities will be missed by many as she moves away from Lexington

By Stacey Grijalva
S TA F F W R I T E R

As everyone prepares to say
goodbye to friends, there is one
more person to hug and promise
to keep in touch. Kristen Pow-
ell, assistant director of student

I. activities and Greek life, and her

husband Jim are leaving.

“I’ll be missing a friend, a con-
ﬁdante, a colleague,” said Margo
McClinton, director of the Com-
mons.

The couple is moving so that
Jim Powell, currently the leader

of Young Life, can work ﬁill-time
for a church. The two are also ex-
pecting their ﬁrst child, jokingly
referred to as Baby Jack for Jim’s
appreciation of “24.”

“lt’s bittersweet because
they are moving on to do things
they wanted to do but they’ll be
missed dearly,” said sophomore
Addy N g. - :

Powell is known for her work
with Panhellenic, various campus
activities such as Battle of the
Bands and from her involvement
with Young Life.

“She has the unique quality
of making you feel like home,”

said Jason Rodocker, Powel1’s
coworker and director of student
activities and Greek life.

If others think of something
to do such as an event, Powell
talked to the necessary people but
helped the student to do the event
by himself.

A 2000 graduate of Washing-
ton and Lee, Powell’s experience
as an alumna gave her great expe-
rience in preparation for her job at
the school.

“As an alum, you understand
the experience,” she said. “You
know the traditions and under-
stand the events. It helps to see

Freshman sets
up poverty panel

W&L student organizes local religious and community
service leaders to discuss the role of religion in poverty

By Sarah Klentz
STAFF WRITER

According to the United States
Census Bureau, over 35 million
people in the U.S. live in poverty.

Freshman Rosemary Boyle
said she wants to ﬁnd a way to
ﬁx it.

Boyle is heading a discussion
board to talk about religion and
poverty.

The discussion will be held in
the Marketplace on Monday eve-
ning at 8:00 p.m.

“My goal is to have an awe-
some conversation and learn all
the dynamics on the issue,” Boyle
said. “[I’d like] everyone to
start talking about it because it’s
avoided in classrooms. This will
be a way to get the discussion out
there.”

Four members of the commu-
nity will act as panelists to get the
conversation started. Some panel-
ists include: Ingrid Easton, found-
er of Campus Kitchens, John Phil-
lips, leader of Volunteer Venture,
Brur Datz, director of Religious
Life and Bill Kline, pastor at Lex-
ington Presbyterian.

The discussion format of the
presentation is particularly im-
portant in order to get audience
members involved, Boyle said.

“Around campus there are
not many discussions, there are
plenty of speakers who are ex-
perts in their ﬁelds that come,”
Boyle said. “I think it is critical
that, to achieve my goal of getting

“My goal is to have an awesome conversation

and learn all the aynamics on the issue. [I’d

like] everyone to start talking about it because

it’s avoided in classrooms. This will be a way to

get the discussion out there. ”

ROSEMARY BOYLE, Class of 2009

the student body to discuss such
issues, we have a discussion. Stu-
dents at W&L are highly intelli-
gent and learning from each other
is an opportunity that I believe we
should take advantage of.”

Boyle said that recognizing
the correlation between religion
and poverty is important in un-
derstanding both issues.

“Most religions teach human
dignity and that we should care
for each other,” Boyle said. “A lot
of times religion is the motivation
behind wanting to help the poor.”

Boyle is putting on the event
as a ﬁnal project for her Interde-
partmental 101 class on poverty.

Her professor, Stacy McLaugh-
lin Taylor, is the acting director of
the Shepherd Poverty Program
and encouraged ﬁnal projects
such as Boyle’s in order for stu-
dents to “explore issues in more
depth and connect them to their
co—curricular and other academic
interests.”

Taylor said any discussion
about poverty is an important one,

and Washington and Lee students
will be particularly interested
when it is coupled with religion.

“It’s an opporttmity for stu-
dents to explore a signiﬁcant so-
cial issue of our time and develop
their own opinion and knowledge
about this issue,” Taylor said. “It’s
of deep interest to our students
with the number of religions [in
this community].”

Taylor added that poverty is
something important for mem-
bers of the W&L community to
focus on.

“It’s easy to go through four
years at W&L without exploring
poverty ﬁrst hand,” Taylor said.
“It’s something we all know a lit-
tle about on surface level but it’s
something we should all explore
in more detail.”

Boyle urged students to at-
tend the discussion so a variety of
opinions can be presented.

“I encourage people to go so
we can get as many different view
points as we can, even if they’re
not religious.”

the big picture [for future plan-
ning], like the need for sorority
houses,”

Powell brings not only the
knowledge of an alumna but also
of a sorority woman.

Ng said, “She’s been through
the whole Greek experience and
so she’s invaluable to be in that
position.”

Before Powell moved to Lex-
ington, she lived in Dallas as a
muralist.

“She has these little skills
that she never talks about,” said
Rodocker. “Such as, I know she
plays the piano and I’ve seen her

paintings. They’re simple, emo-
tional.”

McClinton sums up Powell
with one word — talented.

Powell hopes that she has
made a difference on campus.

“I hope that I have helped de-
velop leadership skills in student
leaders, challenged the women to
stand up for things they think are
important,” she said. “I hope I’ve
helped them learn to set a goal
and respond.”

In her two yeas at W&L, Pow-
ell has made a lasting impres-
sion and leaves behind many sad
friends.

“Personally and profession-
ally, she is ideal to work with,”

said Rodocker. “She keeps you -

focused, helps you to do right,
and praises you when you do it.”

Her replacement has not yet
been named but McClinton is
hopeful that someone will be
hired by the end of the month.
Powell has been taking notes to
help her successor and had a few
words of advice.

“Take time to build relation-
ships and to ﬁgure out the cul-
ture,” said Powell. “The students
are so capable. My role is only to
assist and empower.”

Rape is always rape

Student questions columnists statements on the rape case at Duke University

To the Editor:

At ﬁrst glance, it appears that
Jennifer Sutton’s column (“The
Lessons of Duke”) in last week’s
edition of the Phi could be writ-
ten in a few short sentences. If
I had written the article, then I
probably would have written,
“Washington and Lee could face
a sexual assault scandal because
sexual assault happens at Wash-
ington and Lee.” Seems simple,
right? So imagine my surprise
at Ms. Sutton’s article, which ap-
pears to focus less on preventing
sexual assault than on preventing
accusations of sexual assault.

Before I begin with the bulk
of my letter, I would like to ad-
dress Ms. Sutton’s most confus-
ing claim. Despite their curious
irrelevance to the rest of her col-
umn, Ms. Sutton works in a few
not-so-subtle jabs at “race-mon-
grels like Al Sharpton.” Accord-
ing to Ms. Sutton, this emphasis
is the product of a “larger racial
game” that has been created by
activists. Ooooh, that Al Sharp-
tonl I bet he paid that witness to
report that players from the team
were shouting racial slurs at the
strippers! You know what, he
probably also orchestrated that
thing in Washington, D.C. a few
months ago where one of the de-
fendants allegedly took part in
the beating of a gay man while
yelling homosexual slurs, just for
good measure! That Al Sharpton!
I can’t believe that he is trying
to make race an issue here! All
satire aside, it is Ms. Sutton—not
Reverend Sharpton—who most

clearly illustrates that Americans
are thinking about race in con-
junction with this scandal: “If the
accused are guilty, then they have
desecrated the name of all Cau-
casian suburban athletes at top
schools.”

Although Sutton is correct in
pointing out that a “tragedy” has
occurred in Durham, the focus of
her column is misplaced. Since
we are talking about accusations
of sexual assault, many readers
might assume that the tragedy of
the situation is that a woman ar-
rived at a hospital with injuries
consistent with having been raped
and forcibly sodomized. But Ms.
Sutton presents a different angle.
In order to prevent this “scenario”
from occurring at Washington and
Lee, we need to “know better...
[than] to call up local strippers.”
What? That’s how we should pre-
vent this tragic scenario from hap-
pening here? Since this solution
is clearly not tailored to the vast
majority of sexual assault cases, I
am left to assume that Ms. Sutton
is aiming at another sort of trag-
edy: wrongful accusations.

Let’s analyze this claim a little
more thoroughly. I should start
oﬁ" by reporting a statistic that all
of us should know already thanks
to One-In-Four: The FBI esti-
mates that only about 2 percent
of rape cases are shown to be fab-
ricated or untrue. With that said,
Ms. Sutton’s claims that “time
lines” might prove the defendants
to be innocent are far from air-
tight. This argument relies on a
discrepancy of about 15 minutes

If I had written the article, then I probably

would have written, “Washington and Lee could

face a sexual assault scandal because sexual as-

sault happens at Washington and Lee. ”
 

that exists between the time that
the crime allegedly took place and
the time that an eyewitness says he
saw the ﬁrst two defendants leave
the scene. We should remind our-
selves that this timeline and all
of the evidence accompanying it
have been offered by the defense
and have not yet been challenged
in court. Ms. Sutton. also claimed
that the alleged victim in this case
has made “prior false accusa-
tions” of rape. While the victim
did apparently accuse three men
of raping and beating her when
she was 14, the police chief in
the town in which the report was
made (Creedmoor, N.C.) stated in
an April 28 interview that it ap-
pears that charges were not ﬁled
in that case because this woman
decided “not to pursue the...case
further.” It is not uncommon for
a rape victim to decide not to take
legal action, and that doing so is
more likely to be evidence of the
emotional trauma that accompa-
nies sexual assault than evidence
of false allegation.

Still, Ms. Sutton goes even
further out into the deep end,
claiming that sexual assault while
under the inﬂuence of alcohol is
perhaps not sexual assault at all.

If you're like most Washington & Lee seniors, your college career has been packed with accomplishment
and excitement. Believe it or not, what happens after you graduate can be even better.

one—year master's program speciﬁcally to help liberal arts and sciences majors connect the passion

Well, if they raped someone while
they were drunk, then I would say
that their crime is rape. Can you
imagine how absurd Ms. Sutton’s
justiﬁcation might sound if it were
used for other criminal acts?

I’m really sorry, oﬂicer. I
didn’t mean to drink and drive,
but I ’m drunk! I can’! make ra-
tional decisions! T hanks for being
so understanding!

It seems as though Ms. Sutton
has a hard time accepting that we
are still responsible for criminal
actions when we are drunk. If
students are worried about los-
ing control, then why not cut the
drinking back or use the buddy
system? But Ms. Sutton is still
unconvinced. “In an instance like
this, should inebriation equal au-
tomatic guilt?” Inebriation? No.
Rape? Yes.

Since Ms. Sutton offers advice
to people who want to get trashed
and hook up but who are worried
about getting accused of rape, I
hope that I can offer some of my
own: Don’t rape people. Control
your life a little. You can do it.
Really.

Admissions department deserves
right to keep information private

To the Editor:

Congratulations to the
Ring-tum Phi for publishing
the comments of the Con-
cerned Parent. Nothing like
a little discussion about who
gets in and who doesn’t to stir
the masses. It certainly got
everyone off the couch and
into the game so to speak. I
had plarmed to write you af-
ter the initial appearance of
the ﬁrst letter. It was best I
waited to see the small ﬁre-
storm it created before mak-
ing a comment. Like many of
those who have written, allow
me to provide my stats: I’m
the father of a student — Class
of 2008 and hopefully Class
of 2011. I’m ﬁmdamentally
a liberal by nature but willing
to listen to the “other side” of
any argument. I graduated
from Lehigh, Class of 1976,
and probably wouldn’t get in
today.

I sensed in many of the
well-written letters there was
a desire for disclosure - as in
“if the University just came
forward with what we want
to know then we wouldn’t
be concerned about whether
unworthy people are being
admitted”. As a resident
of Virginia, I can state that
schools like UVa, James
Madison and William and
Mary are forced to play a
numbers game tied to their
status as “state schools”. In
those instances the decisions
are much more metric; they
don’t have the luxury of re-
ally looking at the “worth” of
a potential student.

The great thing about an
institution like Washington
and Lee is they can operate
under their own goals and
objectives. I would like to
suggest to those that have
written, they acknowledge
that the aspect of deciding
who gets in and who doesn’t
with a business oriented
mindset. Those writing the
letters should consider them-
selves as board members of
a corporation. As such, they
are entrusting the corporation
to individuals they believe
best represent their interests.
Most corporate boards don’t
micro-manage the people
they are paying to run the
business--why would they?
Do we really want to know
all of the details of the “ad-
missions scorecard?” Do we
really want to argue whether
a superior SAT score trumps
someone who is president of
their class but doesn’t have a
1400?

As parents, we are
thrilled our son is attending
W&L. On certain criteria he
shouldn’t have gotten in. On
other criteria he should have.
The same can be said for our
daughter who will apply next
year. Suffice it to say we re-
spect the “black box” process
that all universities employ.
If you don’t like the direction
the university is taking (over
time) then change the manag-
ers, but don’t micro-manage
the process.

Seniors Garner, Greiner, Hibbard and Strother

plan to use the grant money to spend next year

abroad in pursuit of their academic interests

while teaching English to local students in class-

rooms in France, Germany and Spain.

Four Washington and Lee se-
niors will be taking their skills
to Europe next fall as recipients
of the Fulbright Scholarship for
graduate study.

Meg Garner, Gwen Greiner,
Meredith Hibbard and Meg
Strother each received a nine-
month grant to teach overseas.

Garner and Greiner will be
teaching in France, while Hib-
bard will be teaching in Ger1na—
ny and Strother will be teaching
in Spain.

According to its website, the
Fulbright has been awarded to
graduating seniors since it was
signed into law in 1946.

It was developed as a way to
promote “mutual understanding
between the people of the Unit-
ed States and the people of other
countries of the world.”

The grant supplies trans-
portation abroad, a monthly al-
lowance and covers the cost of
books.

The Fulbright enables the
winner to immerse herself fully
in the culture of the nation while
continuing her education.

Many recipients of the Ful-
bright teach English in a class-
room while pursuing a personal
program of research based on
their individual interests.

“My teaching will occupy 12
hours per week, and the other
time there I will spend working
on my project, an extracurricu-
lar art program for children,”
said Garner, a French and Stu-
dio Art major who will be teach-
ing in the Nancy-Metz region of
Northern France.

She heard about the scholar-
ship through Dean George Bent,
who was her art history profes-
sor at the time.

Bent encouraged her to ap-
ply because of her love for the
French language, for art and her

All recipients of the Ful-
bright use the money to cover
living and study expenses for a
year while furthering their own
personal research goals.

The money received is usu-
ally enough to cover all expens-
es.

Strother will be using her
Spanish major as a Fulbright
Teaching Assistant just outside
of Madrid in the city of Al-
corcon for at least 16 hours per
week.

She would also like to take
classes at a local university and
further her interest in Spanish
theater.

“I am interested in the idea of
using theater as a teaching tool,”
said Strother.

She became especially in-
terested in Spanish theater after
reading Lope de Vega’s “F uente
Ovejuna” when she studied
abroad in Seville, Spain last
year.

“Performances of plays
such as this one not only give
student audiences exposure to

“I can ’t wait to be in Spain
and have the opportunity to
pour my love for the language
and for teaching into a class-

room full of Spanish students. ”

into history, but also pull to the
surface important issues from a
seemingly archaic work,” said
Strother about the play, written
during the Spanish Golden Age.

Despite the challenge that
living and working in another
country will pose, both Strother
and Garner are excited about
the possibilities for research and
getting to know another culture.

“It’s such an eye—opening ex-
perience,” said Strother. “I can’t
wait to be in Spain and have the
opportunity to pour my love for
the language and for teaching
into a classroom full of Spanish
students 

Strother is hoping that her
time in Spain will help her dis-
cover what she wants to do for
her future.

She wants to ﬁnd a way to
combine her love for the Span-
ish language and her love for
people into a career.

Garner plans on attending
graduate school for counseling
at the Peabody College of Van-
derbilt University in the fall of
2007.

She hopes to combine her
interest in art with her love for
working with children to devel-
op her own art therapy counsel-
ing practice.

Hibbard and Greiner will
also be teaching the English
language overseas and Greiner
will be combining her teaching
with research on the French En-
lightenment.
