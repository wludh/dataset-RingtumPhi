SAB under fire ;
Records burned

by Lee Howard

The Student Activities Board
in the past academic year made
unauthorized expenditures, in-
cluding a $175 loan to this year’s
SAB co-chairman Charlie
Hulfish, Rick Goddard will
charge at the first Executive
Committee meeting on Monday.

Goodard, senior E.C. law
representative, said he was not
able to prove what he thinks
were more massive unauthoriz-
ed expenditures because when
he went to find last year’s SAB
receipts they were all missing.
He said a source within the SAB
told him the receipts were all
burned at the end of the past
academic year.

One voucher he was able to
find, which is now in the posses-
sion of the Ring-tum Phi is for a
“‘loan for housing — pay back in
two weeks.” The loan was made
March 9. According to Goddard,
the loan has yet to be paid back.
The check voucher was signed
by last year’s co-chairman John
Berley. :

Goddard said he is going to
suggest to the E.C. that Hulfish
be required to pay back the loan
within two weeks with interest.
If he did not repay the loan in
that time Goddard said he

- -§$hould be sued.

THE HECKMAN BINDERY, INC.

| Besides unauthorized
jisbursements of money, God-
jard said the SAB mismanged
the money they had. According
to his source, the SAB often left
thousands of dollars overnight

in the SAB office, said Goddard.
Goddard said his source also
told him that one night a drunk
SAB member left about $2,000 in
the trunk of his car.

The SAB also kept inadequate
records, according to Goddard.
Movie receipts and grain party
receipts were either not record-
ed or, if recorded, were not done
on a daily basis, said Goddard.
As a result, there were reports
of stealing, he said.

In order for the E.C. to con-
trol SAB money more tightly,
Goddard is going to propose at
Monday’s E.C. meeting that the
Committee put restrictions on
the money they give out. God-
dard said SAB- members had
private parties regularly at the
student fund’s expense. Yet the
E.C. only authorizes money for
one party; a party just before
Fancy Dress.

Goddard will also propose
that a person be appointed to
each student group to oversee
the expenditure of Executive
Committee money. He said that
many of the checks written by
the SAB last year were personal
checks written to SAB co-
chairman Mike Armstrong and
Berley. These checks were sup-
posedly for ‘“‘incidental’’ ex-
penses, however many of these
checks were for over $100, God-
dard said. Since the receipts
were burned, it is impossible to
tell what really happened to the
money, he said. This is why
Goddard is going to make his
suggestion.

School reopens

by Rex Nyquist

Washington and Lee began its
228th year of undergraduate
education yesterday when
slasses opened. Harold Head,
University Registrar, reported
that 1,690 students had
matriculated as of yesterday
morning. Of these, 304 ‘were
enrolled in the Law School.

William J. Watt, Dean of the
College, said that the goal of the
college remains the same: ‘‘To
provide a good liberal arts
education on the undergraduate
level.”

In pursuing this goal to pro-
vide a solid undergraduate
education, the University faces
several challenges, and is mak-
ing some significant changes.
Among the most obvious of the
challenges is the completion of
the undergraduate library

Returning students noticed
the headway made on the con-
struction of the library,
scheduled for completion in
1980. In addition, the University

   

must raise $650,000 to pay for
the library. To date, the Univer-
sity has raised $8.1 million of
the $9 million necessary to pay
for the construction. A $250,000
Challenge Grant from the
Kresge Foundation of Michigan
means that the university must

Co-Op $80,000 in red

by Heartsill Ragon

Information related to the
Ring-tum Phi by recently-fired
Co-Op manager James E. Toler
has revealed that’ the
Washington and Lee University
Supply Store and Co-Op have
been operating at an approx-
imated $80,000 deficit for the
past four years.

Toler, who was relieved of his
duties as manager of the enter-
prise last spring, reported to the
RtP in a telephone interview
that auditors last year informed
him of annual Co-Op losses of
$20,000.

Toler added that the ‘auditors
said some of these annual profit
losses could be attributed to
pilferage.

According to sources and
rumors around the Co-Op, bla-
tant cases of student as well as
“towny”’ pilferage in the Supply
Store area have gone
unreported and uncontrolled.

Realizing the presence of Co-
Op thievery, Toler said that
several years ago he submitted
a plan to W&L Treasurer
James W. Whitehead that would
increase Supply Store security
while also boosting Co-Op effi-
ciency. New Co-Op manager
Jerry Darrell, during the sum-

mer months, had a partition
built similar to the idea sug-
gested by Toler.

Toler, who lives in Roanoke
and commuted to Washington
and Lee during his eight years
of employment, added that he
believed the primary reason he
was asked to resign by
Whitehead was so that the
University could eliminate his
$10,500 annual salary.

Darrell, manager of Evans
Dining Hall, was chosen to
relieve Toler and take charge of
W&L’s newly created Food Ser-
vice Department.

Darrell said the purpose of
this new partition was two-fold:
first, he said, it was built for
security (I didn’t like the idea of

- it being wide open at night’’),

secondly, and as an _ after-
thought, the new partition was
constructed as a merchandising
aid. Darrell said the added wall
space could be used for display
purposes and thus make the
merchandise more appealing.
“It’s difficult to understand
how an operation with as much
traffic and volume couldn't

break even,’’ Whitehead said.
Contrary to Darrell’s reports

of minimal pilferage from out-

side of the W&L community,

Whitehead said, “Ever since
I’ve been treasurer at W&L,
and even before, I’ve never
heard of an item from that area

being stolen.”

Whitehead said that the new
partition, which to many up-
perclassmen seems like Honor
Code hypocracy, was in no way
connected to security but was
for managerial and merchan-
dising purposes only. ‘‘I don’t
want it to be an expense to the
school where cutbacks have to
take place in other school
areas,’’ Whitehead said.

When asked about the
reported Co-Op deficjts,
Whitehead declined to comment
but said ‘‘...the operation was

not self supporting.’’
Whitehead said the new
partitioned-off Supply Store

could be closed and locked dur-
ing the off-business hours and
thus the University could be
freed of some part-time’
employment burden.

Food services updated

Co-Op cafeteria opens

by Joe Dashiell

In an attempt to consolidate
all food services under one
management, Washington and
Lee has placed the student Co-
Op under the direction of Jerry
Darrell, manager of both Evans
Dining Hall and the Cockpit.
Though only in charge of the Co-
Op for a short while, Mr. Dar-
rell has already made signifi-
cant changes in the snack bar
area. These changes are design-

culate in preparation for school opening.

ed to expedite service without a
loss in food quality.

The most striking feature of
the new arrangement is the
cafeteria-style line. The line
creates an order to service and
at the same time emphasizes
self-service. These factors com-
tine to increase the efficiency of
the women working behind the
counter. Mr. Darrell expects
this new arrangement to in-
crease the volume of customers
by twenty to thirty per cent.

The menu has experienced
minor changes. A few of the less
popular items have been drop-
ped along with those that were
not practical in a cafeteria ar-
rangement. Mr. Darrell has ad-
ded a few items including
salads and a breakfast selection
similar to McDonald’s Egg
McMuffin. As soon as_ the
weather becomes cooler, he
also plans to add hot soup to the
menu. Prices have fallen on
nine items and risen on only
three.

The methods of service have
changed significantly with the
new system. Items like ham-
burgers will be prepared ap-
proximately ten minutes in ad-

vance and placed under a heat

Cockpit plans
more
entertainment

The Cockpit will undergo
several changes this year which
assistant manager Burr Datz
hopes will give it ‘more of a
social atmosphere.”’

Datz says in past years the
Cockpit was a ‘‘catch-all hole.”
He says he hopes the changes
that he and manager Jerry Dar-
rell implement will give the
Cockpit ‘‘more class.”

Perhaps the most significant
change will be the addition of a
stage for live entertainment.
Datz says he expects that live
entertainment will become a
regular Cockpit feature. In
order for this to happen, though,
the Cockpit will have to find
talented student bands and solo
acts. For this reason Datz urges
all persons interested in per-
forming to contact either
himself, Darrell, day super-
visor Francis Davis or night
manager Dan Scott.

In addition to the new stage,
Datz hopes to acquire more
powerful speakers for the per-
formers. Also, Datz intends to
change the tunes in the juke box
either monthly or twice-
monthly.

Farm House Donated

Mr. and Mrs. Leslie Cheek,
Jr. of Richmond have given
‘“‘Skylark’’—their 365-acre
mountaintop estate and
Christmas tree farm on the
Blue Ridge Parkway in Nelson
County—to Washington and Lee
University.

The gift is in memory of the
late Douglas Southall Freeman,
Mrs. Cheek’s father. Dr.
Freeman, biographer of George
Washington and Robert E. Lee,
was editor of the Richmond
News Leader from 1915 to 1949.
His four-volume “‘R. E. Lee’,
for which he won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1935, remains the stan-
dard biography of Lee. He was
again awarded the Pulitzer,
posthumously, in 1958 for his
definitive biography of
Washington. He received an
honorary.Doctor of Law degree
from W&L in 1919.

Cheek was director of the
Virginia Museum of. Fine Arts
from 1948 until his retirement in
1969, the year he and Mrs.
Cheek began construction of
“Skylark.” Cheek, a graduate
in Fine-arts history at Harvard
University and in architecture
at Yale, drew the plans, chose
the materials, and supervised
construction of this ‘‘Village.”’

W&L will operate Skylark in
the same way the Cheeks did,
with a resident manager and
with the university’s Director of
projects spending a portion of
histimetherealso.  -

In addition to its continuing
function as a private farm,
Skylark will also be used for
small meetings, forums, and
similar functions, involving
W&L groups; scholars plans
for using Skylark ‘‘creatively”
will be under study throughout
the coming academic year, ac-
cording to W&L_ president
Robert E. R. Huntley.

The central cluster of
buildings constructed by the
Cheeks at Skylark consists of a
main house with a guest apart-
ment; a guest house; a two-
level ‘barn’ which is, in fact,
the manager’s residence; a
stable; and work shops.

The area is landscaped and
has a small garden. At a
distance from the residences
are a small lake, a tennis court,
and a pavilion for picnicking.

Shortly after they purchased
the land in the mid-1960’s and
before they began construction
of the village, the Cheeks
planted their first crop of 1500
Christmas trees. There are now

ten plantations of Christmas
trees on the farm.

The Cheeks’ gift to W&L in-
cludes the furnishings in . the
house and all the farm equip-
ment.

According to Huntley, “It
simply is not possible to
overstate Skylark’s majesty.
The Cheeks took what is,
without question, one of the
most beautiful natural locations
in Virginia, and did what one
might have thought would not
be possible. With unfailing taste
and elegance, they made it
more beautiful.”’

New
Writing
Test

by Randy Smith

Last Wednesday, for the first
time, all entering freshmen
were required to compose an
essay testing their writing abili-
ty. Theessay was based on
questions concerning assigned
summer reading books, also a
new innovation this year.

The one-hour and 45-minute
examination involved a choice
of one of four education-related
topics, demanding a 400 word
demonstration of prose style.
Although most questions dealt
with varying aspects of the
summer reading, a primarily
philosophical question was add-
ed for those who were not ade-
quately familiar with the
reading material.

The testing came about as a
compromise of three faculty
suggestions: 1) that some sort
of written exam be given to
evaluate writing proficiency ; 2)
freshmen should be given a
summer reading list of from six
to eight books; and 3) that a
greater emphasis be given to
academics during freshman
orientation week. Dean
Huntley, associate dean of
students, hopes that the testing
will enable administrators to
spot those freshmen with
writing difficulties more easily
than in the past.

Essay examinations are
designed to test writing ability,
clarity, and organization.
Students found to have difficul-
ty in any of these areas will be
advised to take a basic writing
skills course. Dean Huntley
stressed that there would be no
obligation to take a basic skills
course, but that for those to
whom it is recommended, such
a course might be important for
future academic success at
Washington and Lee.

SAB Loses Co-Chairman

by Fraser Humphreys

The senior year at
Washington and Lee is a sacred
thing indeed. In some ways it’s
the long-awaited pay off after
three years of inching up the
academic ladder, adjusting to
the unique challenge of ‘“‘the
road’’ and mastering the ‘‘W&L
swing” in general. The position
of a rising senior in good stan-
ding and three-fourths of the
way through is to be admired.

The position of a rising senior
such as Doug Jackson who
possessed all three attributes as
well as the cochairmanship of
the SAB borders on enviable.

Jackson, however, chose not
to return to W&L this year and
opted instead for a year’s leave
of absence to remain home in
Atlanta and work full time for
“the friendship force.”’

The ‘Friendship Force” is a
privately-funded program of
goodwill ambassadors sent
from the United States to

foreign countries tor the simple
purpose of cementing interna-
tional friendship, according to
U. S. News and World Report’s
September 19 issue, which
features a picture of Jackson.
The Friendship Force idea was
originated by President Carter
in 1973 and naturally is now
heavily plugged by the Presi-
dent. He explains, “I want to
see the ties of our country with
other foreign countries—large
and small, powerful and weak.

The Natural Bridge Experience

The 357 freshmen this year at
Natural Bridge had to do
without the traditional Mock
Honor trial that entering
freshmen in the past were
treated to. According to Dr.
James Worth, ‘‘The mock honor
trial did not do a good job of
presenting what the honor
system is truly about. The
honor system is not a farce, as it

may have been interpreted.

from the presentation in the
past. Rather it is something
that is very desirable, and
something to be very proud of.”’
This year the emphasis was on
the ideals of the honor system
instead of the judicial aspects of
the system.

The Natural Bridge festivities
were M.C.’ed by Worth who in-
troduced a variety of speakers
which included Lexington
Mayor Charles Phillips, W&L
Food Services Manager Jerry
Darrell, Dean of Students Lewis
John, and Head of Security
Charles Murray.

Other speakers were Steve
Trigg, who gave a talk on the
Galapagos Islands expedition;
Rick Stein for the University
Federation; Michael Cleary for
the ROTC program; and finally
Dean Sprunt who introduced the
local clergymen. After the
scheduled program ended, the
freshmen were invited to stay
and hear talks from various
organizations on campus which
included the RtP, Mock Conven-
tion, IFC, Contact and others.

Cockpit
(continued from page 1)

Some changes have already
been implemented. The back of
the bar has been redecorated,
and there are new lights behind
the bar. In addition, the Cockpit
is now selling 46 and 32 oz.
glasses of beer as a ‘‘gimmick,”’
says Datz. Larger pitchers of
beer are also being sold now
and can be guzzled down in new
pilsner glasses.

In order to promote the

‘new’ Cockpit, any woman
with a college identification
card will be able to purchase
her ‘‘favorite cold beverage”’ at
half price between Sept. 15-25,
says Datz. In addition, there
will be two happy hours every
week: Wednesday, from 8-9
p.m., and Thursday, from 4-6
p.m.
The idea behind these
changes is to make the: Cockpit
into a ‘Student Center
Tavern,” Datz said. At night the
“tavern” will be fully equipped
with a bouncer, who will check
identification at the side door of
the Cockpit. The front doors will
be closed at night to keep
alcoholic beverages from being
taken out of the Cockpit.

Datz says he hopes the
Cockpit’s change of’ image,
which really started when Dar-
rell consolidated the menu last
year, will draw more fraternity
people He hopes the Cockpit
can compete favorably with
‘‘going down the road”’ by draw-
ing females to the Cockpit with
live entertainment.

The freshmen then took a
break to play softball, meet
each other, and escape the
tedium of the afternoon
meetings. After dinner a class
meeting was held which was
M.C.’ed by Ms. Betty Munger
who introduced Dr. I. T.
Sande:’s, university historian,
who gave a talk on heritage and
tradition at W&L. Sanders was
followed by student body presi-
dent Jim Underhill and vice-
president George Griffin who
gave the presentation on the
honor system.

After the evening session, the

     

Frosh josh during rush

freshmen broke up into 8-10
groups to discuss the honor
system, and to sample beer
from the ten kegs provided by
the Executive Council.

After breakfast Friday, a
class meeting was held with
various professors and students
representing the different
departments on campus
available to talk to the
freshmen about their respective
departments. Following lunch,
the much enlightened and seat-
sore freshmen returned to cam-
pus prepared to take on the
world.

Lewis Hall Photos
Tour Country

An exhibition of photographs
by Lexington photographer Sal-
ly Mann will open at the Cor-
coran Gallery of Art,
Washington, D. C., next Satur-
day (Sept. 24).

The exhibit will consist
primarily of Mann’s ‘Lewis
Hall Portfolio,’ 25 black-and-
white photographs taken during
construction of Washington and
Lee University’s new law
building beginning in 1974. She
is Washington and Lee’s chief
staff photographer as well as a
free-lance professional
photographer.

The photos in the Corcoran
exhibit are abstract and semi-
abstract views that were in-
spired by the shapes and
materials at the construction
site, she says.

Prints from the Lewis Hall
series are included in several
important public and private
collections, including those of
Joseph Hirshhorn and_ the
Polaroid Corp. ‘Lewis Hall
Portfolio” has been exhibited
previously in New York City
and after leaving the Corcoran
will be shown at galleries in
New Orleans and Carmel, Calif.

The prestigious Ferguson
Grant of the Friends of
Photography Society in Carmel
supported Mann’s Lewis Hall
project.

She is a B.A. and M.A.
graduate of Hollins College and
has been associated with
Washington and Lee since 1974.
In addition to her duties as
photographer, she is curator of
W&L’s 10,000-plate collection of

late-19th- and  early-20th-
century photographs’ by
Michael Miley, ‘Robert E.
Lee’s Photographer.”’

She was a co-founder of
‘“‘Image Continuum,’’ a
limited-edition photographers’
journal which gained con-
siderable attention in the mid-
1970s.

Mann is one of the few
Americans currently working
in platinum photography, using
intricate turn-of-the-century
methods. Because of its cost,
platinum has been replaced
almost exclusively by silver in
photo print-making. Platinum,
however, produces a_ soft,
velvet-like image, beige to
sepia in tone, ‘‘like a finely
detailed etching,” she says.

Her husband, Larry Mann, is
a blacksmith in Lexington, and
his Woods Creek Forge is wide-
ly known for its ornamental
ironwork. The Manns are co-
owners of a solar-energy com-
pany as well.

At the Corcoran, her Lewis
Hall photographs will be shown
together with black-and-white
photos by Mike Mitchell, a
Washington free-lance
photographer who teaches at
the Corcoran. His ‘‘romantic-
mystical’ photos depict the
“hallowed grounds” of the
Washington Cathedral and Arl-
ington National Cemetery.

A catalogue with an introduc-
tion by Jane Livingston, curator
of the Corcoran, is being
published in connection with the
show.

The exhibition continues
through Nov. 13.

New Library On Time

by Ned McDonnell

The men, clad in hard hats
and workclothes, scurry around
the five-story skeleton trying to
make up for lost time from last
winter’s frigid temperatures.
With only one day lost to rain all
summer, the construction crew
from Bass Construction out of
Richmond, through remarkable
progress, has_ nearly
counteracted the strong devia-
tion from the ‘Critical Path’ last
winter.

The ‘Critical Path’, a time
schedule for construction pro-
jects developed by Systems
Project Management, Inc. of
Atlanta, takes into account all
facets, variables, and possible
external pressures. The plotting
of the critical path helps dif-
ferent sub-contractors deter-
mine what to do and when to do
it so that the project can pro-
gress smoothly.

Aside from the fluctuations
around the critical path, the
financial side of the project is
fine. With some cost-cutting
measures adopted by the
University, such as changing
over from the ultra-expensive
white cement to the more
economical gray cement, the
contractors are well in the
black. But, as Scott Beebe,
W&L liaison with the project
stated, unknown variables

creating new difficulties could
quickly dry up the surplus.

And what is all this haggling
over the dollar column and
sweating under the sun going to
produce? Our new library.
Supposedly due in August 1978,
Beebe and co-worker Rick
Parker agree that Christmas
1978 is a more realistic arrival
date for the edifice.

The five-floor library, com-
plete with an auditorium and
three elevators, will sit in the
side of the hill directly behind
Washington Hall. Passing
through the mall which will be
pitted between the library and
the colonade, one will enter the
main level atop four other
levels. The main level and
lower level number one will
face Washington Hall while all
five levels will face Wood's
Creek. Along the outer walls of
each level will be study carrels
and offices with the bookstacks
lying in the central region of
each level.

The library will resemble the
new law school. Marcellus,
Wright, Cox, and Laid of Rich-
mond, architects of Lewis Hall,
designed this new haven for
higher learning. The concept of
this building typifies the strong
desire of the University to com-
bine the past and the present for
a better academic community.

New Numbers Man

Robert Stanley Johnson, pro-
fessor of mathematics at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, has been named to a five-
year term as head of that
department. His new appoint-
ment becomes effective Sept. 1.

Johnson succeeds Robert A.
Roberts, who completes his
five-year term as department
head this year.

In addition, the W&L board of

Busy UT Season Ahead

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor

The W&L University Theatre
has announced its schedule of
shows for the new. academic
year—and it is a program full
and.diverse. Making the most
use possible of their two
playhouses, the Troubadour
(corner Main & Henry Streets)
and the Boiler Room (across
Main St. in the Old Main Mall),
the season will include a pro-
gram abroad in the spring while
boosting the number of shows
presented here at W&L to a new
high of seven.

At a glance, the fall term pro-
gram looks as follows... The
season opener will be a produc-
tion of the classic Greek
tragedy, ‘‘Oedipus Rex,”’
directed by Lee Kahn in the
Boiler Room. In the words of
the director, “The main em-
phasis in this show will not be
the usual one of period costume
and makeup to achieve a sense
of time. Rather, we will dwell
on the rhytm and the irony of
the production.’’ The show will
be holding open auditions within
the next two weeks, to: which
any and all interested students
and staff are encouraged to at-
tend. As in previous years, the
UT’s policy is to serve as a
training ground for theatre ma-
jors, but at the same time, to
provide an activity for all
students.

The second major production
this fall will be directed by a se-
cond member of the drama
faculty—Al Gordon, directing
the 18th century comedy
‘Beaux Strategem.” And com-
pleting the line-up for fall will
be a one-night return per-
formance in November, by the
Mime Company of the Warsaw
Chamber Opera, bringing their
new inventions to. the
Troubadour. The highly ac-
claimed troupe was warmly
received last year, for a six-
week program of performing
and teaching.

Winter term will include an
unprecedented three major
productions—all in_ the
Troubadour—while student-
directed one acts will be shown
regularly in the Boiler Room.
The opener is Eugene O’Neill’s
“Desire Under The Elms,”
directed as a Senior Thesis Pro-
ject by Chris Willett, and the
first major O’Neill play to be
presented on this campus in 14
years. Following it will be the
second Senior Thesis Project in
directing, ‘‘The Ritz’ directed

by Barry Godin. And rounding
out the winter collection will be
another production directed by
Professor Kahn, ‘‘‘Butley,’’ the
modern English drama _ by
Simon Gray.

The six-week spring term of-
fers students a unique op-
portunity to take the drama-
abroad program in London, and
become totally immersed in the
subject. London is the usual
destination of this group, for in
the words of one of them, ‘‘The
city simply has more good
theatre productions per square
foot than anywhere else in the
world, including New
York...and the prices for tickets
are quite a bit more
reasonable.”’ Anyone who is in-
terested in information concer-
ning this program—costs, size
of group, and the like—are re-
quested to call Lee Kahn at the
Troubadour as soon as possible,
at 463-9111, Ext. 371.

But, for those whose interests
remain here in Lexington, plans
go on for a full program here at
W&L, in the Total Theatre
course. This year under the
charge of Al Gordon, the
theatre has yet to come to a
final decision regarding choice
of plays, but prominent in con-
sideration have been the com-
edies of Kaufmann and Hart,
and other modern American
comedies.

This year has a smaller
number of senior majors doing
special projects than usual, but
the three who are seniors this
year have a wide range of ex-
pertise, working in virtually all

areas of drama. Chris Willett,
House Manager of the UT last
year, has acted in plays such as
last year’s ‘Dr. Faustus.” In
addition, Chris has already
worked as the Assistant Direc-
tor on two major shows, last
year’s “Threepenny Opera”
and ‘Barefoot in the Park.”
Barry Godin is an acting
regular at UT, and has combin-
ed this with working as Stage
Manager for such shows as
“The.Tempest” and W&L’s
much-acclaimed _ presentation
of ‘‘1776.”’

The third and final senior ma-
jor, Warren Mowry, has chosen
his thesis concentration in ac-
ting. No stranger to the techni-
que, Warren has played major
roles consistently, beginning
with his first part of the Mayor
in ‘‘The Visit.’’ Other roles have
included Col. McKean in ‘‘1776”
and, of course, Willy Loman in
last spring’s ‘‘Death of a
Salesman.” His one-man show
will be centered on playing the
character of Clarence Darrow.

So, another season is on the
verge of starting, and the time
to say a few words about ticket
operations. They are free for all
members of the W&L com-
munity, but reservations are
necessary before each show.
The box office number is
463-9111, Ext. 371, and as before
all tickets must be picked up 24
hours in advance or they will be
redistributed. The Ring-Tum
Phi wishes the UT the best of
luck for another successful
year.

 

THE NOSE

Halleleujah it’s over and time
to get back into the swing of
things. Have you ever gone
through a summer like the past
one? The campus was a mess.
Of course not much more could
be expected short of absolute
chaos with a certain Dean’s son
running around with more keys
than the warden of Alcatraz.
What in God’s name is he still
doing around here. I thought he
graduated three years ago.
“Flesh” is gone, to some peo-
ple’s joy, others’ sorrow. The
question is, will he ever pay the
hundreds of dollars in library
fines he owes? Rumor has it
that a certain member of SAB is
eyeing for his old jobs. Dean
Diddle has a new assistant. He’s
an old Wash. Hall man

SAB Fall Movies Announced

Glen Stanford and Steve
Mangan, Co-Chairmen of the
SAB Film Subcommittee, have
announced their schedule for
the fall term to be presented in
DuPont Hall. Further coverage
of each movie will follow in the
Ring-Tum Phi’s subsequent
issues. All movies listed are to
be presented at 7 & 9, unless

specified otherwise...
“The Graduate,’’ Sept. 16-18;
“Seven Ups,’ Sept. 23-25;

‘Lawrence of Arabia’ (at 6 &
10), Sept. 30-Oct. 2; ‘‘Hang ““Em

High,” Oct. 14-16; ‘‘State of the
Union,” Oct. 21-23; ‘‘Oliver!’’,
Oct. 28-30 (at 6:30 & 9—
Parents’ Weekend)...

Also, ‘“‘The Out-of-Towners,”’
Nov. 4-6; ‘“Dog Day Afternoon,”
Nov. 11-13 (at 6:30 & 9); “‘The
Three Musketeers,” Nov. 18-20;

ther,’’ Dec. 2-4.

Slots for next term’s movies
are still open...Anyone with sug-
gestions, please contact the
SAB in the University Center.

the real world for two years and
now is back at W&L. Proof that
W&L does not prepare you for
the business world. It only
prepares you to be a Dean at
small conservative men’s col-
leges in the south.

The SAB was quite shaken up
a bit early in Sept. It seems
Doug Jackson had to leave the
country for South America very
suddenly, which left a vacant
seat in the chairmanship of the
SAB, A very small person on the
SAB is very excited, because he
actually thinks the EC will ap-
point him as co-chairperson
with Mr. Hulfish.

Speaking of the Co-Op. What
in the world is J. D. trying to
do? Gone are the days when
Fanny would shout (in a
whisper) ‘‘two eggs with ham.”
Now we have Egg McQuick. I
hope J. D. isn’t trying to get a
patent on it. The only federal
agency interested is The Center
for Disease Control. Gone also
is the Dynamic Duo of Hair
Spray Henrietta and Teasing
Tesse from the Supply Store. Do
you ever get the feeling what
this campus will look like when
we come back for our reunion?

Well that’s all the nose knows
for now. If you hear any news
put it on a piece of hoagie paper
and slide it under the Ring- tum-
Phi office door of the Student

Annie Hall

by Seth Oserin

“Annie Hall,’’ appearing at
the Lyric this week, is Woody
Allen’s follow-up to ‘The
Front’’—a production which in-
troduced a total change in
Allen’s presentation and style.

The plot involves the study of
the relationship between a ris-
ing young comedian (Woody
Allen), and an insecure, im-
mature Annie Hall (Diane
Keaton). We are witness to the
development of attitudes in the
relationship, as well as develop-
ment of the personalities of the
respective characters.

Anyone who has yet to see
‘The Front’’, would undoubted-
ly be surprised at Allen’s latest
thesis. His toned-down style
concentrates more on the
significance of comedy to the
script, rather than the im-
mediate, face value impact on

the audience. Allen uses his
usual cleverness in attaining
this goal, such as his use of
solicited opinions from total
non-entities. These opinions are
used to help him make decisions
on his private life. (The amaz-
ing thing is that everyone knows
about his “‘private’’ life, and
talks as though they’ve been
watching the whole affair on
“Days of Our Lives.’’) Thus,
this more subtle style of com-
edy has won over many a
Woody Allen critic.

Diane Keaton does a fine job
transforming the character of
Annie Hall through her various
personality changes (which is
the eventual reason for the ter-
mination of the relationship).

All of the above considered,
this is definitely one of Allen’s
winners (did he ever lose?)
and is especially recommended
to those who consider Allen and
his usual comedy an _ un-
fortunate reincarnation from
the dark ages.

Aerial attempts to upgrade image

by Parker Potter

Ariel. To most people Ariel,
like lacrosse, frisbees and tub-
ing signals the start of Spring at
Washington and Lee. Unlike the
above activities, Ariel enjoys
somewhat less visibility than
those tiny little boll weevils who
fill your mouth with cotton after
a long evening of mint julips.
This year there will be an at-
tempt to upgrade (create?) the
image which Ariel seems to
lack.

The first major innovation is
the shift from a plea for
manuscripts to be slipped under
some door. Rather, I hope to in-
crease both quality and quanti-
ty of contributions by working
directly with the people who
write. My goal is to make Ariel

Auditions for the W&L Glee
Club have been announced for
this week, under

the direction of Dr. Gordon:

Spice of the music department.
They will be held in the Mu Beta
Psi (music fraternity) room in
the basement of the University
Center. All interested students
are invited to try out. If there
are any further questions,
please contact Dr. Spice.

Spanish Theatre

Four short theatrical pieces
in Spanish will be presented in
Washington and Lee. Universi-
ty’s Troubadour Theatre next
Monday (Sept. 19) at 7:30 p.m.

The pieces will be performed
by Servando Carballar and
Carmen Heymann. Their tour
of the United States is spon-
sored by the Spanish Foreign
Ministry. Washington and Lee
is their first tour performance,,

The visit to Washington and
Lee is sponsored by the Spanish
department. The performance
is free and the public is invited
both to the performance and to
a reception afterwards in
Washington and Lee’s Alumni
House.

a writer’s magazine. I feel that
the prospect of contributing
ideas as well as manuscripts is
much more stimulating than
the idea of slipping a poem to
some anonymous editor.

When I took over as editor of
Ariel, it was my contention that
there is far more creative talent
at Washington and Lee than a
perusal of Ariel would seem to
indicate. I want to bring that

talent to Ariel.

To that end there will be a
meeting some time next week to
get together and bat some ideas
around.

Anyone interested in working
on Ariel this year is asked to
contact Parker Potter at Pi
Kappa Phi, 463-2750 or 463-4532
or at home, 463-2334. A meeting
time will be worked out.

 

Changes in Coop Building—
yes. Reorganization and some
rearranging but the basic idea
of a center of community life
still remains. The Bookstore
has expanded its baliwick to in-
clude textbocks and records.
However, the organized chaos
still survives. We continue to be
dedicated to the fine art of
browsing. .

At the ~ ment everyone’s
mind is on . .tbooks. Our goal
is to have a book on the shelves
for every student who wants to
buy one the day classes start.
It’s a form of Russian roulette,
but we hope the number of pro-
blems will be small and not too
nerve-wracking for faculty and
students (to say nothing of
Bookstore personnel).

Textbooks are _ shelved
alphabetically by course and
numerically within the course.
Books may be returned for
refunds (on approval of the
manager) only if the course is
cancelled, the course is dropped
(drop slip needed) or the wrong
book has been purchased.

At the moment the Bookstore
is cashing checks for students
as a part of the superb service
which we give. The limit per
check is $20 and there will be a
charge for bounces.

On to more cheerful matters:
50 copies of the new J. R. R.
Tolkien book, The Silmarillion
arrived in the Bookstore a week

 

Eve and Ear:
from the Bookstore

before publication and almost

all are sold. Seventyfive _

copies came in this morning. So
Middle Earth rises to the top of
the best-seller world again.

 

Special news from the record
shop:

As you all probably know we
do have a record shop—and it’s
very alive and well. In fact I
think you’ll find us most ac-
commodating. We will be glad
to special order any record not
in stock that you want at no ex-
tra cost. In addition to the
largest selection of classical

‘LP’s in the area, you will also

find our pop-rock and jazz selec-
tions are good. We are up-to-

date but also stock many old].

classics.

Along other lines, this year
we will have full lines of audio
equipment available by order at
excellent prices for you. This
combined with selections of
blank tape and our everyday
lowest prices in town give you
the best deal you can find for
music in the area.

Please stop in. We are under
the Bookstore. Come and
browse, ask questions, and
listen to tunes. In addition there
will be a column appearing here
regularly keeping you up-to-
date on what we feel are the
best of the new releases...Come
by and smile.

Dupont Gallery
Opening

W&L’s University art gal-
lery will re-open with a pub-
lic reception on the evening
of September 19, next Monday,
announced department head Al

Gordon. Featuring wine and

cheese, and open to all students,

faculty, and staff of the univer-
sity, this is an all-new way of
kicking off a full year of exhibi-

tions.
The works in the gallery are

those of Bruce Gagnier. They
will be available for viewing
from next Monday’s reception
(at 7 til 9 p.m.) through October
7. Gagnier, a resident of New
Jersey, has also done some
work at Haverford College in
Pennsylvania. All the displayed
works will be paintings, par-
human

ticularly’ of frontal

figures. Gagnier’s technique is
especially interesting, as he
utilizes wax, benzene, and oil
paint in production.

For those unable to come to
next Monday night’s special
showing, the gallery will also be
open during the week between
its regular hours of 9 until 4. Of
course, there is no admission
charge.

The gallery calendar is
already full for this academic
year, with 8 exhibitions by out-
side artists. In addition, each
senior art major will present his
own personal showing, and the
studio art students will join
their talents in an ensemble ex-
hibit later in the year. Further
details on later events will be
released by the gallery.

Faculty
Accomplishments

A new, substantially revised
version of a_ college-level
geology textbook written by the
head of Washington and Lee
University’s geology depart-
ment has just been published.

The second edition of “In-
troduction to the Structure of
the Earth,” by Edgar W.
Spencer, was released this spr-
ing by McGraw Hill. The book
was first issued in 1969,

The text is designed for use in

structural geology courses in
which the emphasis is on basic
principles. Topics covered in-
clude selected aspects of
regional structural geology, the
Structure of ocean basins, the
earth’s interior, and tectonics
(the study of changes in the ear-
th’s crust).

Spencer is a 1953 physics
graduate of Washington and
Lee. He received his Ph.D. in
geology from Columbia Univer-
sity in 1957, the year he joined
the W&L faculty. He became
head of the department in 1959

at the age of 28.

He is the author of four other
college textbooks in geology:
“The Dynamics of the Earth”
(1972), ‘‘Geology: A Survey of
(1965), and
“Basic Concepts of Historical
Geology”’ and “‘Basic Concepts
(both

Earth Science”’

of Physical Geology”’
1962).

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has taken two awards for
photography in the annual com-
petition sponsored by the Coun-
cil for Advancement and Sup-

port of Education (CASE).

The awards were for a port-
folio of 12 photos by Sally Mann,
the professional photographer
in Lexington who is also W&L’s
chief staff photographer, and
for a separate portfolio of
photos by ~ others, including
students, three fromer universi-
ty photographers, and other

W&L officials.

The two W&L awards were
among 50 announced by CASE
this week. They were chosen
from more than 700 entries, the

organization said.

Lawrence D. Gaughan, pro-
fessor of law at the Washington
and Lee University School of
Law, was appointed chairman
of a National Council on Family
Relations task force this sum-
mer. He will study special men-
tal health concerns in national
health insurance.

Gaughan, president of the
Rockbridge-Buena Vista Bar
Association, has written an arti-
cle with Washington and Lee
law Professor Lewis H. LaRue,
‘The Right of an Institutionaliz-
ed Mental Patient to Refuse An-
tipsychotic Medication,”’ which
will appear in the December
issue of the University of Toledo
Law Review.

In October, Gaughan will pre-
sent a paper to the American
Association of Sex Educators,
Counselors and Therapists in
Asheville, N. C. The paper is en-
titled “Legal Issues in Sex
Counseling and Therapy.”

Two scientists at Washington
and Lee University have been
awarded grants to support their
research.

Frederic L. Schwab, pro-
fessor of geology, has received
a North Altantic Treaty
Alliance (NATO) grant for
research he will conduct this
fall in Europe while on sab-
batical from his teaching. He
will study the characteristics
and distribution patterns of
sedimentary rocks in the
French, Swiss and Italian Alps
and in the Appenine belt in nor-
thwestern Italy.

Leonard E. Jarrard, pro-
fessor of psychology and head
of that department, has receiv-
ed a $24,200 grant renewal from
the National Science Founda-
tion (NSF) to support continua-
tion of his pioneering research
into the functions of the hip-
pocampus, a small segment of
the brain which is associated
with motivation, memory, and
patterns of basic behavior such
as eating, drinking and sleep-
ing. Since 1965, the federally
supported NSF has provided a
total of more than $200,000 in
support of his hippocampal
studies.

THE

RING-TUM PHI

Stearns Preps
Young Team

by Jerry Harris

In the world of intercollegiate
sports, such names as Colum-
bia, Penn State, Syracuse and
Villinova bring visions of na-
tional rankings, championships
and All-American athletes. So
what is Washington and Lee
University, a lowly Division ITI
school, doing in a league with
those schools?

The Generals are ranked in
their class because W&L will
compete on a varsity level in
water polo for the first time
ever after five years of par-
ticipation in club competition.
W&L is part of the Middle
Atlantic Conference which in-
cludes all four of the aforemen-
tioned schools and some others
as well.

As a club sport, Coach Bill
Stearns and his charges have
done quite well. The highlight of
the past five years was a second
place finish behind the Univer-
sity of Richmond last season in
the Virginia State Tournament.
However, Stearns readily ad-
mits that, “I really don’t know
what the devil we’ll do in this
new conference.” The key to the
upcoming season is experience,
endurance and injuries.

Water polo is a sport that
demands top-notch conditioning
and adequate swimming exper-
tise. While the Generals do have
some super swimmers and have
been emphasizing conditioning
in practice, they are severely
hindered by a lack of numbers.

This problem is one of Coach
Stearns’ main concerns.

He points out that the vast
majority of those already out
for the team (11 total) are just
beginning to learn the game so
that newcomers would not be at
any disadvantage. The polo
head mentor noted that he
would welcome new recruits
and is attempting to gain some
new players from the water
polo P.E. class.

Although depth and en-
durance will be a major hurdle
for W&L, it can be overcome.
Not so for the problem of ex-
perience. Stearns will sport a
club in the first tournament that
shows only one junior and no
seniors. Such youth will prove
helpful in the future growth of
the water polo program but for
this season it could be a major
stumbling block to the Generals
goal of having a _ winning
season.

No matter that the two
troubles mentioned are serious
ones; the most bothersome pro-
blem for W&L is injuries. Three
of the top performers have in-
curred injuries that could
severely cripple the swimming
club. The most damaging blow
was the loss of Billy Myers for
the season. He was the goalie
last season and filling that slot
will be tough. Another loss is
that of Biff Martin who must
overcome an illness before he
can perform up to par.

(continued on page 7)

Soccer Outlook Good

Great strides have been made
by second-year coach Rolf Pira-
nian in an effort to improve the
soccer team’s 1976 3-10 showing.
The ‘‘A” license coach, the
United States Soccer Federa-
tion’s merit of highest coaching
ability, held by only seventy-
nine other coaches in the
country, feels that the fifteen
veterans of last season combin-
ed with the input of talented
freshmen will deliver at least a
.500 season and a run at the
ODAC title.

Piranian is basing the
likelihood of success on a hustl-
ing, intimidating, and
sophisticated defense. ‘‘In the
past,’’ he says, “‘we played a
4-3-3 system. This year we'll
make innovations as_ they’re
called for against different
teams. Ultimately I hope to go
to a man-to-man defense.”’

The beauty of the man-to-man
defense is that is pressures the
opposition so much ‘‘that they

can’t do anything offensively.”
Last year W&L’s opponents did
anything they wanted to, scor-
ing thirty-seven goals, while on-
ly giving up fifteen. With eight
out of fourteen of W&L’s rivals
in Division I, the likes of

Virginia and Navy, the
defense’s task will be an ar-
duous one.

American soccer is

characterized as being ag-
gressive and defense-oriented.
According to Piranian this is
hecause of the lack of ‘‘finesse”’
ballplayers in the United States.
Coach Piranian hopes to imitate
this lusterless, but winning
style. Against the stronger
teams on this season’s schedule
he figures that W&L’s victories
will be 1-0 or 2-1 decisions.
Piranian believes that the
skills of the players have in-
creased under his tutelage. He
has worked on fundamental
techniques, whereas his
predecessor chose not to em-

Generals Run Out Of

Time In Season Opener

by Pete Abitante

Had the NCAA decided to
change the length of its football
games to 39 minutes and 53
seconds at its last annual spring
meeting, W&L would have won
its first season opener in four
years—10-9. As it stands
though, the NCAA made no such
amendment to its constitution
and, thus, the Generals gave
Loch Haven State its first open-
ing day victory in seven
years—22-10. Fine personal per-
formances turned in by Scott
McLan, Kevin McGowan, and
Donny Crossley were over-
shadowed by costly penalties,
mental miscues and missed
receivers all coming at inop-
portune times.

Loch Haven, playing in the
same tough Pennsylvania Con-
ference that brought
Millersville State to Lexington
last year, opened the scoring on
their first possession, controll-
ing the ball for 13 plays. The
drive culminated in a 25-yard
field goal by Kent Harshman.
The Generals came right back,
displaying a good ball control
game of their own. Ted Hissey
hit Richie Wiles with a 12-yard
pass and Danny Thompson pro-
vided the conversion to cap a 10
play, 70-yard drive. With that,
W&L seemed to capture the

momentum and the lead 7-3.

But momentum is a funny
thing. With the Bald Eagles
driving, Donny Crossley in-
tercepted a pass on the W&L 47
and made a spectacular run-
back for a touchdown only to
have it nullified by a clipping
penalty. After an exchange of
punts, Loch Haven once again
mounted a drive. This one was
almost exclusively on the runn-
ing of Steve Housler who car-
ried the ball on 7 of 11 plays
totaling 55 of the 79 yards.
Quarterback Dan Spittal scored
on a five yard keep but the extra
point was no good. Kevin
McGowan angled in unmolested
from his left end position to
block the PAT. Housler by the
way, went on to lead all rushers
with 132 yards on 22 carries.

With the score 9-7 at the half,
the Generals came out and
drove for a score in their first
possession after the intermis-
sion. Donny Crossley’s 26-yard
punt return, made possible by
several perfect blocks, gave the
Generals the ball at midfield.
Eight plays later W&L settled
for a field goal, a 37-yarder by
Thompson, with 7:34 remaining
in the third quarter.

W&L continued to move the
ball with sophomore running
back Scott McLam providing

Cross Country Aims
For Improvements

by Warren Mowry

Continuing a winning tradi-
tion is never easy, but for Coach
Dick Miller’s cross-country
teams winning has become
almost a habit. After coming off
a 9-5 record last fall, with above
average performances in post-
season meets, this year’s squad
aims to equal or improve their
predecessor’s record.

Losing to graduation only last
year’s co-captains, Mike Burns
and Paul Thompson (who was
unable to participate last
season because of injuries),
Coach Miller welcomed thirty
candidates to pre-season
workouts, among them twelve
freshmen and five returning let-
termen. ‘‘That may seem a

small percentage of let-
termen,” commented Coach
Miller, ‘‘but considering only
7-10 men run in each match, we
really have a pretty strong
nucleus.”

Leading the returnees are
senior co-captains Al Weeks
and Bill Welch. These two will
form the core along with senior
Kevin Grimm, junior Jim
Frantz, and sophomore Richard
Bird. Though refusing to ‘“‘put
myself out on a limb” by mak-
ing any predictions, Coach
Miller nonetheless seemed con-
fident of his team’s abilities.

One new development is a
conversion to an 8,000 meter
course as opposed to the old five
mile format. This change

(continued on page 11)

the punch. Playing especially
hard to offset the loss of Stu
Atkinson (ankle _ injury),
McLam showed some great
daylight running, carrying the
ball 15 times for 65 yards and
hauling in 6 passes for 48 yards.
All told, McLam contributed 113
of W&L’s 218 total yards.
However, penalties and mental
errors slowed the Generals
momentum and eventually put
Loch Haven out in front.

After Dan Thompson’s at-
tempted field goal went wide
right, Loch Haven took over and
drove 80 yards in 6 plays for
what proved to be the winning
score. The big play of the drive
came when fullback Charles
Lucas brought the ball inside
the W&L 5, lumbering 35 yards
on a counterplay. Two plays
later Housler crashed in from
two yards out. A two-point con-
version pass was deflected by
Jeff Slatcoff and Loch Haven
held a 15-10 lead.

A General comeback drive
was thwarted when Loch Haven
cornerback Doug Posey in-
tercepted his second pass of the
game and returned it to the
W&L 21. Four plays later runn-
ingback Joe Brooks swept
around left end for the final
score making it Loch Haven 22,
W&L 10.

For two and a half quarters,
W&L deserved to win their
opening contest. The offense,
while looking a little rusty from
lack of scrimmage games, suc-
cessfully moved the ball, with
the offensive line opening up
some beautiful holes. The
defense also showed’ some
streaks of brilliance, but the
Loch Haven counter- play ac-
tion attack seemed to leave
defenders out of position, as at-
tested to by their total offense of
368 yards.

With Davidson the opponent
this week, several changes will
have to be made. The offense
has proven it can move the ball.
A healthy Stu Atkinson:-will give
the Generals that much more
potential. If the defense can at-
tain some consistency and im-
prove its pass rush, Davidson
could be in for a tough after-
noon. There is no doubt W&L
has the personnel to beat
anyone on its schedule, but
unless they play all out for four
quarters, not even the NCAA
can help them. oe

‘Year Of The Generals’

by Pete Abitante

With the return of forty-six
veterans, including 32 let-
termen, optimism is running
high that ‘77 could be the “Year
of the Generals”. Coming off
their most fruitful season in
nine years (5-5), Coach Bill
McHenry and his staff find
themselves loaded with both
youth and experience. Of the
returning lettermen, only eight
are seniors, thirteen are
juniors, and eleven are
sophomores. Thus _ having
underclassmen starting the
past few years seems to have
paid off.

Leading the Generals through
the first eleven game schedule
in their history are senior co-
captains Jeff Slatcoff and Mark
Duncan. Slatcoff, returning to
an inside linebacker position
after a year at middle guard,
will anchor what should prove
to be an invincible linebacking
trio, combining with junior in-
side linebacker Carl Folcik and
junior middle guard George
Ballantyne. Duncan forms the
nucleus of the offensive line,
considered the most improved
facet of the team by Coach
McHenry, as four of five
starters return. Joining Duncan
are sophomore guard Scott
Smith and junior tackles
George Berry and Dan Kniffen.
The other guard spot seems to
be a battle between two juniors
at this time. Jim Guynn once a
center, and specialty team ace
Dave ‘‘Monk’ Hamra, have both
looked good in _ pre-season
workouts with a slight edge go-
ing to Guynn.

The offensive backfield, once
suspect, has come into its own.
Senior quarterbac’: Ted Hissey,
ODAC’s leading’ passer last
year with over 1400 yards, leads
the Generals veer attack. He
will be handing off to a pair of
talented sophomore running
backs in Stewart Atkinson and

Scott McLam. But another dif-
ference in this year’s backfield
is that the Generals have depth.
Hissey is backed up by junior
Scott Swope, sophomore Keith
MacMillan, and freshman Chris
Leisure. Similarly, senior Ed
Johnson and sophomore, Marty
Piccoli are experienced backs
who could step in and play on a
moments notice. Freshman
Karl Cheatham could also see
some playing time.

Several talented receivers
return, led by junior flanker
and ‘76 team leader in recep-
tions, Richie Wiles. Tight end
Bob Szczecinski, fully
recovered from the nagging in-
juries of last year, is back,
while senior Bill Frear, given
the tough assignment of filling
the shoes of departed Tony
Perry, rounds out the receiving
corp. In addition, sophomores
Scott Caddell, Sid Farrar and
freshman Larry Davis provide
the necessary depth.

On defense, cornerback Jack
Norberg and safety Don
Crossley, both all-conference
performers last year, return to
form the heart of the defensive
backfield. The rangey secon-
‘dary, which intercepted a
record 21 passes last year, has
been depleted, though, by the
transfer of two starters.
Regardless, Coach McHenry
places great confidence in hard
hitting, but untested second-
year players Bob Clements and
Kevin McGowan, whom he calls
‘‘more than adequate
replacements.’’ Linebacker-
turned-roverback Larry
Kanavas brings aggressive hit-
ting and experience to the
defensive backfield, and senior
Phil Bailey, junior Larry
McNulty, sophomore Mark
Lewis, and freshman Jim
Herbert are ready to go if called
upon.

If there is a problem on this
year’s team it could be the
defensive line where only one

Water Polo

(continued from page 6)

blems are perfectly illustrated
in the case of Keith Romich.
Romich is the only bona fide
“star” of the team at present.
His experience and conditioning
are unmatched but a strange in-
jury to his shoulder makes him
a questionable starter at pre-
sent. Romich is a returning All-
State water polo member and
an All-American swimmer. He
could be the key. to W&L’s
season as Stearns pointed out
when he said, ‘If he can play
well, he’ll really help us.”’

Even though injuries, depth
and inexperience are. worrying
Stearns, the club will still be
blessed with some. talented
young athletes. Foremost on the
list are three players who saw a
lot of action last season —Scott
Duff (All-American swimmer),
Bob Newcomb and Drew
Pillsbury. Pillsbury might be a
real important asset if he fills
the position of goalie. Other
members of the squad at pre-
sent are Mike Foley, Will
Hodges, Tim Manson, Peter
Stanford, Paul Koehler and

David West. All are young and
have a lot of potential according
to Stearns.

W&L will utilize a pressure-
type game that Stearns hopes
will keep the opponents off-
guard. The head mentor pointed
out that only superior condition-
ing by the Generals would allow
them to reach their goal of a
winning season.

But even if W&L does not
have a winning record this
year, they can still accomplish
the ulterior goal of the team.
‘We hope to build the program
up,” and to help this cause
along, the head coach has struc-
tured on exciting strategy,
organized a young team and is
scheduling two key tour-
naments to be held in Doremus
this season. The first, an open
Invitational, will be held on Oc-
tober 7, 8. Then the State Tour-
nament will be hosted on Oc-
tober 28, 29. Stearns hopes that
the two events will draw large
crowds and just as much sup-
port for W&L’s newest varsity
sport.

   

starter returns—junior tackle
George Fisher. The other tackle
spot will be filled by sophomore
Jamie Ryan, while the defen-
sive end positions will be a toss-
up. Battling for the split end
spot are part-time starters from
last year Greg Lilly and Tom
Baynham, while junior Ken
Smith and sophomore Mark
Louden compete for the other
end position. Junior Mark
Travers and freshman Bob Gor-
don will provide the depth.
Although backed up by ex-
cellent linebacking, the line will
have to develop some consisten-
cy if the defensive unit is to jell.

The kicking game should be
in fine shape as placekicker
Dan Thompson returns for his
third season to handle the
placements.

Phil Bailey and sophomore
Sid Farrar, one and two respec-
tively in the ODAC last year,
return to handle the punting
chores.

Overall, the Generals have
what could be the finest team
since they joined the college
division three rankings in 1955.
The players are excited, com-
mitted and have worked hard
during the preseason. ‘“‘We are
looking forward to an exciting
and challenging season,” says
coach McHenry. “Our attitude
is high, and with a little work on
our execution, we can be a fine
football team.” Coach McHenry
also added that the first two
games against Lock Haven
State and Davidson College
could set the tone for the year
especially with an eleven game
schedule.

Yes, with the proper execu-
tion, a little jelling on offense
and defense, the proper adjust-
ment by new and experienced
players, and a little luck to stay
free of injuries, this could in-
deed be the “Year of the
Generals.”

For Brains,

by Jim Barnes

As the practices for the fall
sports teams begin, coaches are
appraising, exalting, and be-
moaning the corps of freshmen
athletes, reaped from their ar-
duous efforts of recruiting the
previous year. However, at
Washington and Lee recruiting
does not have the traditional
connotation it commands at the
Big 10 or the Ivies. Coaches,
bound by the restrictions of
Washington Hall, are unable to
provide grants-in-aid and
scholarships, or even to insure
the entry of a talented but
adademically deficient athlete.

“They do a good job,”’ says
Director of Admissions James
Farrar, ‘“‘Sometimes I think
they’re harder judges of a stu-
dent’s academic credentials
than we are.”’ Both the admis-
sions and the athletic depart-
ments are quick to point out the
good relations that have existed
over the years between them.

Farrar feels that coaches who
go on “recruiting’’ trips are a
valuable arm of the admissions
department. ‘‘When they go toa
high school they don’t simply
discuss the benefits of playing
sports at W&L, they emphasize
the school’s academic offerings

Brawn

and standards.’ Compliantly,
coaches only encourage
athletes to apply to W&L if they
have certain academic
qualifications. Farrar says,
“We tell them at the beginning
of each year to look for students
with mid-500 boards and in the
top quarter of their class.”

This year athletic department
figures indicate that their
recruiting activities con-
tributed to 500 out of the 1320 ap-
plications received by the ad-
missions department. Farrar is
skeptical of this figure claiming
that “‘initial contact’’ might
have been made with the offices
in Washington Hall, rather than
on recruiting trips. Farrar ex-
plains that when a student ap-
plies to W&L and states an in-
terest in playing sports, or has a
background of playing varsity
sports at his high school, the ad-
missions department alerts the
respective coach and lets him
chose to pursue the prospect or
not. Farrar claims the number
of applications attributable to
the athletic department is
below 400.

One big impediment to
W&L’s coaches’ recruiting ef-
forts is the nonexistence of
athletic scholarships. When the

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Well, here we start another school year, and as has
been true with other school year beginnings, school is
not the most important thing about the start in most
people’s minds. Rush is; and the mad rush to have a
good rush is on.

As usual, everyone is involved. The upperclass
fraternity men are striving to fill their quotas: The
houses have been overhauled, the taps have been
cleaned out, personalities have been sufficiently sac-
charined, and the golden bids have been polished.

The GDI’ s, when asked for advice about fraternity
life, givea slightly slanted view about fraternities and
the way of life they themselves have chosen. Pointing
out the evils of initiation, Hell Week, and the hazing
that is not supposed to exist, the independents give a
little support to their own recruitment program.

And the freshmen, who are already bewildered by
beginning a new life in college, leaving home, parents
and friends for the first time, and trying to decide
what courses to take and which highway to set their
lives on, are stretching to put their best foot forward
into the doors which (they have been led to believe)
lead to the only social life on this campus.

The questions we continually ask are “Is this the
right way to handle rush? Are the freshmen, for
whom rush is supposed to benefit and protect,
prepared to make the all-important decision of going
frat or going independent with so many other and
maybe more important decisions to be made first?
Freshmen should not join a brotherhood of in-
dividuals based upon the first impressions a frat
house has made upon them. It would be better if they
were given more time to get to know what lies behind
the often plastic rush mask.

Visit a fraternity during rush and you won’t have to
listen hard to hear complaints like, ‘‘God, rush is a
bore’’ or ‘‘I’ll be glad when this is over.’’ The frat
brothers don’t actually take rush seriously, as
evidenced by the number of reported violations and
warnings given to each house. As soon as rush is over,
they can strip away their facade and resume being
themselves.

This is the present atmosphere that surrounds rush
and it is defeating the whole purpose of rush. That
purpose is to give the freshmen a clear picture of
every fraternity and to help them decide whether or
not they want to join a frat, and which frat will be
right for them.

If rush were held during the winter term, the
freshmen would already be settled into the study part
of college life. They would have had a half year to
get to know the different frats and explore below the
surface level of the brothers’ personalities. They
would also be exposed to the different avenues of
social and extracurricular pursuits available to the
W&L student. All these would contribute to their deci-
sion of joining a frat or remaining independent. And it
would relieve much of the pressure that now exists
during beginning-of-the-year rush to “‘hurry and join
a frat before it’s too late.”

But, alas, since tradition is so strong and important
here at W&L, and because this present form of rush is
the way it has always been done, many ripe and inno-
cent freshmen will be lured by the melodies of the
fraternal pied pipers and ‘‘shag”’ and “‘pretzel”’ their
way into what many consider a regretable decision.

FACTS ABOUT WINES

 

Winetasting
Want to learn to taste wines
so you can select your own
favorites? Wine is a personal
experience and the best way
to choose the ones you like is
all in the tasting.

Winetasting obviously in-
volves your sense of taste plus
two others, sight and smell.
You start by looking at the-
wine. Pour some into a clear
wine glass. Hold it by the
stem, examine the _ wine
against the light. Your wine
should be clear, brilliant,
without any suspended ma-
terials.

Next comes smell. You test
the wine with your nose to
determine its aroma or fra-
grance of the grape from
which it was made and its
bouquet, the scent resulting
from the fermentation pro-
cess. Swirl the glass a few
times to release aroma and
bouquet. Then, don’t be
bashful. Put your nose right
in the glass and sniff. If the
wine smells bitter or vinegary,
it isn’t good. It should be a
pleasurable experience. You'll
quickly discover why we
winemasters consider this a
vital part of the tasting pro-
cess and that each wine has
what we call its own “nose.”

Finally, taste your wine,
sipping just a small amount.
Roll it around in your mouth
to coat your taste buds. At
this stage, you’re judging the
wine’s character—its body
and richness. Next, swallow
the wine. As you do, judge its
aftertaste or what is called
the wine’s ‘“‘finish.’’ And, if
you’re tasting more than one
wine «at a time, rinse your
mouth out with water be-
tween sips. It cleans your
taste buds. :

Winetasting is an enjoyable
part of my job and it’s the
process I use to seleet wines
produced by my _),family’s
winery, B. Cribari & Sons.
And, by the way, we have the
largest public tasting room in
California where you, too,
can ‘personally sample our
fine wines to your heart’s
content. Do come and visit us
at Fresno—it’ll be an ex-
perience you'll always trea-

McDaniel Leads
Archaeological Survey

A team of Washington and

ducted an archaeological
survey on behalf of the National
Park Service in the northern
section of the Shenandoah Na-

The purpose of the survey
was to determine if any
prehistoric or historic sites of
significance are located in an
area designated for develop-
ment near the Dicky Ridge
Visitors Center.

Dr. John McDaniel, director
of the Liberty Hall team, said
the students searched the area
and sunk test pits looking for

Dr. Halford Ryan, assistant
professor of public speaking at

of American politics make them
interesting to listen to, and pro-

An ardent yachtsman
named Paul A. Sperry
slipped on a wet boat deck
on a blustery day in the mid-
1930s—and that mishap led
to his inventing an anti-skid
rubber sole that is still the
basic functional sole of to-
day’s Sperry Top-Sider boat
shoe.

He was searching for a
solution to the slippery sole
problem when he observed
his pet cocker spaniel run-

yard. Carefully examining
the dog’s paws, he noticed
little cracks going in all
directions on the pads of
the animal’s feet. He
worked out a similar zig-zag
pattern for a boating shoe
sole—and the Sperry Top-
Sider came into being.

Today, 42 years later,
these traditionally styled,
quality-crafted shoes, made
by Uniroyal, range from
smart penny loafers and
moccasins to classic
sneakers, in canvas, suede,

Recruiters Make The Grade

(continued from page 7)

university offers money to an
athlete with financial need, it’s
usually broken down into three
categories, a grant, a loan, and
work study. In most cases the
loan and work study makes up
60-70% of the money received
by the student. It’s unlikely that
this total sum contributes to
more than 50% of the student’s
college costs. As one coach put
it, ‘‘How do you get an athlete to
come here when he’s offered a
complete free ride at some

other school?”’
Unlike some of the nation’s

most prestigious institutions,
W&L’s coaches cannot engage
in the practice of ‘‘wild-
carding”. This allows coaches
to admit an athlete by fiat under
some previously determined
quota that the coach has been
allotted for that year. Some
coaches here.don’t fee! com-
fortable with that practice.
Lacrosse coach Jack Emmer
says, “You’d have to be careful
wild-carding. You have a situa-

tion where one coach is making
a decision on the prospective
success or failure of a student
academically. At a place like
this I think that’s unfair to the
individual you’re_ wild-
carding.”

However coaches point out
that they’re not formally involv-
ed with the admissions pro-
cedure. Basketball coach Verne
Canfield says, “I think it’s in-
teresting to note that in my 14
years here, there’s never been a
member of the athletic depart-
ment on the admissions’ com-
mittee.’ The fact is there has
never been an athletic faculty
member on the admissions
committee. Athletic Director
Bill McHenry states, ‘I think
any faculty member in my
department is qualified to sit on
the admissions committee.”
Coach Emmer thinks having a
coach involved in the admis-
sions process ‘‘would be a good
idea, if possible from the
coach’s time standpoint.”

Mr. Darrell has already
heard complaints, however, he
feels most are unfounded. Some
people are concerned over the
pre-cooking of hamburgers. Mr.
Darrell responds to this com-
plaint saying that last year,
hamburgers were cooked in the
morning and then steamed
when they were needed. This
year a customer will receive a
hamburger that has been off the
grill only a few minutes.

There will definitely be pro-
blems with the new arrange-
ment. The reorganization was
started on Tuesday, August
30th, and completed in only
forty-eight hours. As with any
new system problems must be
ironed out. Famie Smothers,
who manages the operation on a
day-to-day basis, has worked
for the university for twenty-
five years and is receptive to

the wishes of students. Mr. Dar-
rell promises that changes will
be made as necessary.

necessitated some minor
alterations in the course,
thereby shortening it by slightly
over fifty yards.

The harriers open their
season at home in a squad meet
against Davis and _ Elkins,
Sheperd, and West Virginia
Tech and have only two more
home meets before climaxing
the season with the ODAC
Championships and the Divi-
sion III National Champion-
ships, being held in Cleveland
Nov. 12.

“In the past,” Farrar said,
‘Faculty members on the ad-
missions committee have been
those who teach degree offered
subjects. Four years ago the
question of placing a member of
the athletic department on the
admissions committee was
raised. The idea was rejected
by the committee which
nominates its own successors.

Dean Farrar doesn’t believe
that a coach on the admissions’s
committee would be prejudiced
in admitting an athlete over a
non-athlete if his academic
record didn’t merit the deci-
sion. It is reasonable therefore
to assume that a person, who
comes in contact with young
men daily, who shares in their
emotions of success and failure,
and who constantly is striving
with them for perfection is as
competent a judge as the person
whose contact with young men
is disunited by the desk and
lectern.

the off-season last year’s team
members played indoor soccer,
which promotes quickness and
contact. They also participated
in summer leagues.

Enjoying the benefits of a
good recruiting year, Piranian
expects that there will be
freshmen starting on both the
offense and defense. He insists
there are no secure positions on
the team at this moment. Pira-
nian forsees ‘‘every position on
the team being fiercely con-
tested.’”’

Another one of Piranian’s
goals is to upgrade the soccer
program in general at W&L. He

cites improved morale and
comraderie over preceeding
teams, including the highly suc-
cessful ’73 team which he, co-
captained, as a reason for op-
timism about this and future
seasons.

The first action for the
Generals will be in a two-day
tournament at Virginia
Wesleyan on the 17th, and 18th,
of this month. None of the teams
in the tournament are of the
caliber of some of W&L’s up-
coming Division I opponents. A

poor showing in this early ac-

tion could be the prelude to
another disappointing season.

friendly—strengthened. I think
it will be an exciting thing.”’

Jackson’s involvement with
“The Force’’ began last sum-
mer through his minister, who
happens to be the national
leader of the organization.
Jackson worked as an ad-
ministrative assistant for the
Force’s first mission to
England.

Jackson’s friends report that
he found the travel and interna-
tional experience very much to
his liking. In August Jackson’s
minister asked him to join “‘The
Force” as a_ full-time paid

employee in the upcoming year,
and guaranteed him a job upon
graduation from W&L.

Although his decision was
difficult, because of his respon-
sibilities to the SAB, Jackson
decided, after prompting from
deans and friends, to take the
job.

That leaves Charlie Hulfish
as the sole head of the SAB.
Hulfish said, however, ‘‘As far
as I understand it the E. C. is
reopening the consideration of
applications and I imagine that
will be coming up soon.”’ The E.
C. will probably consider the
issue at their first meeting on
Monday.

~ SAB chairmen storm back

Berley, Armstrong
refute allegations

by J. Michael Gallagher

Last year’s co-chairman John
_ Berley told the Phi Wednesday

> that inadequacies did exist in

the SAB’s accounting pro-
cedures, but that the SAB was
“only following an E.C. outline
on how to keep records’. He
said that the SAB had not been
required to keep the receipts of
expenditures made, (which

E.C. law representative Rick

Goddard last week alledged to
have been burned) but instead
only kept record of the
vouchers. (The RtP has seen
these vouchers, and SAB ad-
visor Mike Cappeto said, ‘‘to the
best of my knowledge, these
records are complete’’. )

Berley admitted that this was
an inefficient way of keeping
records, but said that he and
Mike Armstrong had, early last

year, recommended to the E.C.
to do away with the old practice
of keeping records, and to adopt
a more efficient one. Berley
said this was not done.

Addressing another part of
the article, Berley said that it
was true that during Winter
Weekend an SAB member had
kept $2000 in the trunk of his
car, but denied that the
member was _ intoxicated.
Berley refused to identify the
SAB member.

Berley said at Monday night’s
E.C. meeting that the SAB had
not regularly held parties for its
members at student body ex-
pense. He pointed out that the
E.C. had approved funds for a
Fancy Dress party for the
members. Berley told the Phi
Wednesday that he had failed to

Calyx reports theft

by Galen Trussell

Over $400 in cash was stolen
from the Calyx business office
in the Student Center last Tues-
day, after the money was col-
lected during matriculation.

According to Calyx editor
Temp Webber, a total of $1,318
was collected for yearbook pic-
tures during matriculation last
Tuesday. Webber said the
money was to be deposited in
the Calyx account with the
University, however, the money
was not deposited because the
person depositing the money
didn’t know the Calyx account
number. Since the money
couldn’t be deposited it was
brought back to the Calyx office
and hidden in a desk drawer.

Webber recalled locking the
door on his way out at 3:30 Tues-
day afternoon. When he return-
ed to the office at approximate-
ly 5:45 p.m., he found the door
unlocked but didn’t check the
money. The next morning Web-
ber and business manager
Grant Leister recounted the
money and found they only had
$918. The total amount missing
is $410.

Webber said he had no idea .

how the money could have
disappeared, but that it must
have been stolen between 3:30
p.m. Tuesday and 9 a.m.
Wednesday. Webber and
Leister are the only two
students with keys to the Calyx
office.

According to Mike Cappeto,
Student Center director, all
locks in the Student Center were
changed over the summer and
no student have master keys.

Webber said as of yet he
wasn’t sure how the robbery
was going to effect this year’s
Calyx. He said he wouldn’t
know until after E.C. budget
hearings next week. Webber did
conceed that he will ask the
E.C. for more money in lieu of
the robbery.

 

EC votes 5-4-1]

 

by Lee Howard

Charlie Hulfish was retained
as Student Activities Board co-
chairman by a 5-4 vote Monday
night during an emotional and
tension-wrought Executive
Committee meeting.

Hulfish, it was reported in the
Ring-tum Phi last week, ‘ook
out a loan of $175 from SAB
funds on March 9. The loans
was made with the understan-
ding it should be paid back
within two weeks. Hulfish said
he did not pay back the loan un-
til Sept. 13. The Phi was inacu-
curate in stating last week that
the loan had not been paid back
as of Sept. 16.

Hulfish said the reason he
asked for the loan and the
reason he was unable to repay
the loan were related to the
financial affairs of his parents.
He said his parents are divorc-
ed and remarried. His step-
father ran into financial dif-
ficulties and deserted his
mother, while his father was
forced to declare bankruptcy
and is not working as a chauf-
feur, he said.

Hulfish stressed he had every
intention of paying back the
loan within the required time.
Unfortunately a child support
payment of $200 was not for-
thcoming becuase of the finan-
cial situation of his father, and
he was also being sued by his
landlord, and paying legal fees,
he said.

When asked why he hadn’t
asked the business office or the
Emergency Loan Committee
for a loan, Hulfish said he

Hulfish retaine

already owed the business of-
fice $145 and he understood the
Emergency Loan Committee
had a $50 limit on loans.

The $175 loan went for the
purpose of making a deposit on
a house for the coming year,
Hulfish said. He said the rental
of houses is on a first-come,
first-served basis and he
wanted to be sure of securing a
particular house. He paid back
the loan at the beginning of this
school year. On Sept. 18 after
the Ring-tum Phi article ap-
peared stating that Rick God-
dard would ask for repayment
of the loan with interest, Hulfish
gave Jim Foreman $9.29 for in-
terest on the loan, sources said.
That’s nine per cent interest,
Hulfish said.

Goddard, senior law school
representative on the E.C.,
made the motion to remove
Hulfish. He said that Hulfish us-
ed SAB money “‘in contraven-
tion of the intended use.’’ He
said that the E.C. was faced
with a “precedent” of what to
do about a person who misuses
funds. He said Hulfish was plac-
ed in a position of trust and he
abused it. Goddard said the
issue was not whether the SAB
would be able to put homecom-
ing on without Hulfish, the issue
was whether or not Hulfish
abused his trust by taking out
the loan.

Others disagreed with God-
dard, saying the fact that
Hulfish did not try to hide the
loan and paid back the loan with

Goddard

clarifies
charges

The Ring-tum Phi stirred up
quite a bit of controversy this
week when it printed allega-
tions made by Rick Goddard
that the SAB had made
unauthorized expenditures,
kept poor accounting records,
etc. Goddard attempted to
clarify some of his allegations
at Monday’s Executive Com-
mittee meeting.

Goddard said his allegation
that SAB receipts were all buris-
ed at the end of the past
academic year came from a
source within the SAB, Tim
Hendry, last year’s treasurer.
However, Goddard said, now he
believes such a statement was

conjecture on Hendry’s part. He

said Hendry told him he didn’t
know what happened to the
receipts. ‘‘As far as I know they
could have been burned,”’ God-
dard quoted Hendry as saying.
Goddard stressed that he had
no intention of impugning the
character of either of last
year’s co-chairman, Mike Arm-
strong and John Berley. He just
wanted to bring it to the atten-
tion of the student body that
some of the accounting pro-
cedures followed by last year’s
SAB ‘were sloppy,’ he said. By
pointing out the fact that it was
impossible to determine the
legitimacy of certain expen-
ditures without receipts, he was
just trying to underline the
faults of the system, not charge
the co-chairmen with any
wrong-doing, Goddard said. He
added that he was sure every
single expense was legitimate.
Despite grilling by Berley,
Goddard refused to back down
on some of his other accusa-
tions. He maintained that
sources within the SAB told him
that the SAB held unauthorized
parties at the expense of the stu-
dent fund. Berley catagorically
denied this and asked Goddard
to reveal his sources so the
misconception could be put to
rest. Goddard refus ‘ed to do so.

‘ He also couldn’t name the dates

the parties were supposed to
have been held.

Goddard also maintained that
because money was left in the
SAB office overnight, there was
a substantial amount of theft.
While some SAB members ad-
mitted money was left in the of-
fice overnight, Berley denied
any stealing had occurred.

IFC less severe
on frat violations

by Reid Slaughter

As the fifth week of rush ap-
proaches, one of the more
unpleasant aspects has to be
dealt with—that of rush viola-
tions. Each of the sixteen
fraternities has been notified of
their alleged violations and will
be given a chance to appeal any
or all of them before the Student
Affairs Committee this Wednes-
day.

Violations range from failing
to return rushees back to the
Freshman Quad by _ the
specified time, to openly dispen-
sing beer or liquor during Open
Houses. The amount of each
fine depends on the relative
seriousness of each individual

offense, and usually range from
a low of $5.00.to a high of
$150.00. In some cases, the fine
is suspended and only a warn-
ing given.

According to IFC Vice Presi-
dent Howdy Knipp, this year’s
committee is “more conscien-
tious; more aware of rush of-
fenses and how to deal with
them.’’ This is in response to
protests by fraternities last
year that the IFC was being to
harsh in the levying of fines
without proper warning or in-
vestigation. This was perhaps
due to the fact that less offenses
were discovered, and IFC of-
ficials handed out maximum
penalties to cover the violations

that were not found out.

The result is that this year the
IFC has given out more warn-
ings and less severe fines for
minor offenses. There have,
however, been reports of major
offenses, but specific details
will not be available until at
least after Wednesday’s Stu-
dent Affairs meeting.

IFC officials remind fraterni-
ty members that until the Oc-
tober preference card date, all
rules of rush apply and will be
enforced. Final reports on
specific offenses and the frater-
nities involved in those offenses
will appear on a later issue of
the Ring-tum Phi.

Homecoming bands named

by Kenneth Mastrilli

Archie Bell and the Drells,
along with M.F. Rattlesnake
will highlight W&L’s
Homecoming weekend this
year, if Evans Dining Hall
manager Jerry Darrell can pro-
duce a liquor license allowing
beer to be carried throughout
the University Center complex,
it was revealed Tuesday by Stu-
dent Activities Board co-
chairman Charlie Hulfish.

If this one-night license can-
not be obtained for the dance,
then a different band will have
to be contacted in place of Ar-
chie Bell and the Drells, ac-
cording to Hulfish, if one could
be found at such a late date.

New SAB Co-chairman Bill
Tucker said that most of the
good rock bands in the SAB’s
price range had already been
booked up, but that the SAB was
able to sign M.F. Rattlesnake
for approximately $600. This
little-known band has agreed to
play anywhere on campus, in-
cluding Zollman’s Pavilion, a
place where the ‘“‘Drells’’ ab-
solutely refuse to play, ac-
cording to SAB secretary Tom
McCarthy.

For the sake of freshmen,
Zollman’s Pavilion is an old,
dilapidated storage building
about six miles out of town
that’s frequently rented by
W&L, VMI and Southern
Seminary Junior College for big
weekends and various and sun-
dry activities.

Archie Bell and the Drells are
a popular soul group, popular
enough to command $2,200 for a
performance which should last
at least fifty minutes, according
to McCarthy. However, they in-
sist the only place where they
are willing to play is at Evans
Dining Hall, otherwise they will
not play here, said McCarthy.
They insist on having a big area
where students can dance and
move freely.

Reducing congestion and sav-
ing money are also reasons that
the SAB wants to open up the
whole University Center for
Homecoming as well as Fancy
Dress, according to SAB.

We could save money if
students were allowed to. take
their beers with them when they
want to leave the Dining Hall.

When they get back, students
always want a new beer instead
of finishing the old one,’’ said
McCarthy.

Dining Hall manager Jerry
Darrell is in the process of try-
ing to contact the local ABC
agent who, according to sources
within the SAB, holds conser-
vative views a little to the right
of Barry Goldwater. ‘‘He’s a
very conservative guy,’’ said
McCarthy, ‘‘and we don’t want
to pressure him.”’

“The SAB, McCarthy said,
“hopes to convince the agent
that for safety’s sake it would
be better to open the whole stu-
dent center.’’ McCarthy cited a
hypothetical example where so-
meone might be hurt out in the
middle of the dance floor, and
“if the congestion was eased up
somewhat, it would be much
easier to get help to someone
that needed it.”’

SAB co-chairman Tucker
says he does not want to risk
losing the Dining Hall’s liquor
license for Fancy Dress, and is
willing to “let Homecoming

ride for a good Fancy Dress.”’
The traditional Thursday
night Pavilion party has also
been canned this year under
what can only be described as
“administration pressure to
take it easy,”’ according to SAB
secretary Tommy McCarthy. In
fact the only Thursday night
party all year long will be dur-
ing Fancy Dress. McCarthy
would not divulge the names of
any specific admininstration of-
ficials who had applied the
pressure to rid W&L of these
Thursday night extravaganzas.
Friday evening, October 9, is
the big night. Both bands are
expected to play at least 50
minutes apiece starting around
8:30 p.m. Hopefully, beer will
be served. The exact cost has
not yet been determined, ac-
cording to McCarthy. Saturday
afternoon there will be a grain
party at Zollman’s beginning
around 2 or 3 p.m. It’s not yet
known whether entertainment
will be provided at this affair.
Class passes will be required.

Tucker new SAB

co-chairman

by Randy Smith

In a special session Tuesday,
the Executive Committee ac-
cepted Bill Tucker’s application
to help head the Student Ac-
tivities Board. Tucker, a junior
with two years experience on
the SAB, replaces the absent
Doug Jackson as co-chairman,
entering the position at a time
when the committee is facing
heavy criticism for fund misap-
propriation. Tucker’s avowed
goal as co-chairman is to
‘reinstate a sense of confidence
in the students for the integrity
of the SAB.”

In addition to his respon-
Sibilities as co-chairman,
Tucker will also have the duty
of coordinating activities in the
Cockpit. The goal of manager
Jerry Darrell, who is working
closely with Tucker, is to in-
crease the utilization of the
Cockpit’s facilities by W&L
students. Both are hopeful that

through a more consistent live
entertainment program and
new innovations—such as a
‘‘gong show’’—that their goal of
more student involvement with
the Cockpit will be realized.

Homecoming weekend is the
first major problem facing the
new co-chairman. Because of
various problems, there is, at
this writing, no place where
students can drink beer and
listen to the two bands schedul-
ed to play the night of October
7th.

SAB and administration of-
ficials have been negotiating
with the regional director of
Virginia’s Alcohol Beverage
Control to obtain a 24 hour li-
quor license for the dining room
with little success. Many rules
and stipulations not only make
the license difficult to get, but
jeopardize future beer con-
sumption anywhere in the Stu-

’ by Dave Talley

The Washington and Lee Col-
lege Republicans have been
named “Best Club in the Na-
tion’’ by the College Republican
National Committee. The W&L
CR’s have held this title for 8 of
the last 10 years. ‘‘Naturally we
are thrilled with this, the
highest honor bestowed on any
College Republican club,” said
President Steve Yeakel, ‘“‘but
the CR movement has progress-
ed so much in the last few years
that the pressures of maintain-
ing this honor are great,
possibly too great. We will
simply continue to devote our
efforts to the movement, keep-
ing in mind that hard work and
camaraderie are as important
as any award we can receive.”

“On the contrary,” Yeakel
added, “losing the title would
cause problems. We've got this
Stationery, you see...’’

The club also reports that the
membership drive during
matriculation resulted in a roll
of over 300 members. ‘‘We con-
sider this very successful for a
non-presidential election year,”
President Yeakel said.

The W&L CR’s kick-off their
social calendar on Friday with
their annual fall picnic. ‘‘The
picnic is always one of the
club’s biggest events of the
year,” says Mark Mainwaring,
membership chairman. ‘This
year we’re expecting about 150
girls from around the state to
attend and, as always, we’ll
have plenty of good food, beer,
and music.’’ The picnic will be
held in Woods Creek meadow
behind the Woods Creek apart-
ments from 5:30 p.m. on. It is
open to members only, but
memberships will be available

 

at the event.

Democrats

by Tony Carli

The Washington and Lee
Young Democrats were born
again last year and it was ex-
pected by some that it would
continue its phoenix-like ex-
istence. The organization’s new
president, Lee Cave, seems to
have the battle cry, “Life,
Never Die!’’ He argues that
they are not on a quitoxical
quest to compete with the Col-
lege Republicans, rather, their
objective is to form a viable
political organization with
which to be reckoned.

To initiate this journey, the
Best Small College Club in the
Commonwealth (to quote the
award they received at last

April’s Young Democrat state;

convention) is to hold its first
meeting of the year, tonight at
7:30 in the Student Center. They
hope to acquaint new members
and those possibly interested in
the club with their plans for the
coming year. Of high priority on
the plans list, is the organiza-
tion’s inauguration of a speaker
program which will feature
several up and _ coming
Democrats from throughtout
the country. Democrats from
Sweet Briar, Randolph-Macon
W. C., UVa., Richmond, and
Lynchburg are planning to at-
tend.

This no-so-new Young
Democrat club just might be
one of the fastest growing clubs
on campus. With a doubling of
its membership in just two days
of matriculation last week, that’
observation just might not be
too far-fetched.

 

 

SAE remodels house

by Ned McDonnell

While most fraternities on the
W&L campus had to start from
scratch on repairs and
maintenance during the pre-
Rush work week, one house,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, had a
substantial head start thanks to
a $75,000 grant from the Univer-
sity. And where did most of this
money go? ‘‘Behind the walls,”
notes one “E’’, meaning the
reconstitution of the plumbing
systems and electrical wiring of
the aged, clapboard house.

Other features include a new
paint-job of the interior of the
building, new storage space in
the basement, extensive
remodeling of the bathrooms,
and new thick, near fire-proof
doors for the bedrooms. Aside
from the doors, other anit-fire
improvements included the in-
stallation of new smoke and fire
alarms and a new wrought-iron
fire escape for added safety of
brothers living in the house.

The repairs undertaken at
SAE this fall reflect the tighten-
ed safety standards for older
multiple housing units around

Virginia. With these standards,
SAE sophomores can now have
the best of two worlds: the
charm of those beautiful clap-
board homes of past eras with
the added safety of modern
residential living.

Hulfish retained

interest showed his integrity.
Also, because information
about the loan has become
public, it was argued that
Hulfish would be sure not to
make the same mistake again.
Sophomore representative An-
dy Bodenstab commented that
the SAB got more interest from
Hulfish’s loan payment that
they would have gotten from a
bank.

Hulfish advocates said that
homecoming would probably
not come off without the co-
chairman. They said there was
too little time and too much to
do for a new co-chairman to
step in and learn the ropes.

When the votes were counted
Hulfish had been retained by a
5-4 margin, with one abstension.
Goddard, Neil Pentifallo, Mike
Missal and Jack Bovay voted to
depose Hulfish. Jim Underhill,
Doug Perkins, Jim Davis, Steve
Abraham and Andy Bodenstab
voted to retain him. George
Griffin abstained.

Although Goddard lost his
fight to have Hulfish deposed, a
proposal of his to safeguard
against the misuse of student
body funds by student organiza-
tions passed unanimously. This
was Goddard’s four point pro-

posal:
1. New accounting guidelines

— All student organizations
must from now on retain all
receipts. This is to make sure
all checks can be proven to have
been written for legitimate pur-
poses. The SAB had previously
only kept receipts for a month
or two.

8 Authority for
disbursements — Only the
chairman and the treasurer of
each student organization will
have the authority to make
disbursements. Those persons
are on their honor to account for
all monies disbursed. It is
presumed to be an honor viola-
tion if these persons cannot ac-
count for the monies.

3. Loans — No student group
may authorize a loan.

4. Safeguarding money — The
E.C. authorized the SAB to get
night deposit bags so they could
make deposits after the
business office closes at 5 p.m.
Previously the policy had been
to lock the money in the office of
University Center director
Mike Cappeto. However on oc-
casion the SAB did leave the
money overnight in its office.

new SAB co-chairman

dent Center (even in the
Cockpit). The regional director
has also cautioned that if such a
license were granted, ABC of-
ficials would be on hand to
monitor student conformity to
the provisions of the temporary
grant.

Although the gym _ would
make a good setting for the
Homecoming concert, past ex-
perience assures that Coach
Dick Miller would not allow
alcoholic beverages in the
building. To get around his rul-
ing, kegs could be placed out-
side and beer consumed there.
But Tucker pointed out that this
plan was implemented two
years ago with most people
gathered around the beer and
few students inside listening to
the music.

Tucker gave a third option, or
the Zollman’s Pavilion solution,
which has been virtually
eliminated because the school
grain party and various frater-
nity parties will take place
there Saturday night. Also of
some consequence, the soul
band scheduled for Friday
refuses to play there. Tucker
said that they had apparently

     
    
 

played to a W&L crowd at the
Pavilion before.

With all the complications in-
volved, Tucker said that there
is a_ possibility of a dry
Homecoming night on the 7th,
but was hopeful that a solution
could be worked out in the next
two weeks. ‘Jerry Darrell is
backing us all the way and do-
ing his best to get the liquor
license changed.” However,
Tucker was quick to suggest
that the reason behind the
SAB’s trouble in obtaining the
proper liquor license was a
“reflection on the students” and
their past behavior on such oc-
casions.

Dean John named

director of NASPA

Lewis G. John, dean of
students at Washington and Lee
University, has been named
director of the division of
governmental relations and
legislation of the National
Association of Student Person-
nel Administrators (NASPA).

In his new capacity with the
organization he also becomes a
member of its overall executive
committee.

John, W&L’s chief student-
services dean since 1969 and
director of financial aid prior to
then, has been a member of the
government-legislation division
of the deans’ organization. He
will be its director through
mid-1979.

John is also the author of an
article, ‘‘Student-Consumer
Protection in Higher Educa-
tion,”’ to be published in a for-
thcoming issue of the NASPA
journal.

A British judge will speak
about Great Britain’s court
system at Washington and Lee
University next Monday night,
Sept. 26.

The Honourable Edward
Eveleigh, a judge of the High
Court of Justice, Queen’s Bench
Division, will lecture on the
topic ‘From Arrest to Verdict
in an English Criminal Court”
at 8 p.m. in the Moot Court

Room in Lewis Hall. .

As a justice on the High
Court, Sir Edward has tried
both civil and criminal cases.
He sits on the criminal division
of the Court of Appeals and
works with the Lord Chief
Justice and one other judge in
the Divisional Court, which is
primarily concerned with ad-
ministrative law and appeals
from statutory tribunals.

He is in the United States as a
member of an eight-man team
of English lawyers meeting
with a team of American
lawyers on the subject of civil
and criminal appellate pro-
cedures. The American team is
led by Chief Justice Warren E.
Burger. The British team is led
by a member of the House of
Lords, England’s highest court
of appeals.

Sir Edward has been a
member of the Bar Council and
the Supreme Court Rules Com-
mittee, president of the British
German Jurists Association
and presiding judge of the South
Eastern Circuit for four years.
England’s Central Criminal
Court, also known as “the Old
Bailey,’’ was within that
jurisdiction.

The public is invited to attend
the lecture.

fice.

After E.C. members had
finished questioning Berley and
after Berley had reciprocated
with Goddard, the former co-
chairman referred to the Ring-
tum Phi. Citing last week’s arti-
cle and speaking for Arm-
strong, Berley said, “This arti-
cle casts extreme doubt on our
honesty and integrity.’’ He then
threatened to bring a lawsuit
against the Ring-tum Phi for
libel.

A Traveler
from

Altruria

Some things a freshman
should never say to an up-
perclassman:

1. “What is ‘going down the
road?’ Sounds like a song from
The Wiz.”’ No, no. That’s Ease
On Down The Road. Besides, if
you mention a song from a
black musical, they'll im-
mediately castigate you as a
soul freak.

2. ‘You are not a stud.’’ Most
people would be very pleased if
you affirmed to them the fact
that they weren’t a fat old horse
useful only for breeding pur-
poses. But at W&L you might as
well call a person a eunuch.
Very touchy, these eunuchs.

3. “W&L is not very good
academically.”” Please. Our
school, which we have paid
$3,300 per year to attend, not
good academically? With such
reknowned professors as....,
and there’s always.....Well
sheepskin is expensive this
year.

4. ‘‘Lacrosse? I thought only
girls play lacrosse.’’ This one
will get you a bop in the nose
from a 6’6’’, 230 pound hungry-
looking guerilla who is male, I
assure you. And he carries a big
stick.

5. ‘The Republican party
should waste away and die.”
Hold your tongue lest thou be
branded a communist and be
brought before the Student Con-
trol Committee on pot-smoking
charges. For everyone at W&L
knows GOP-liness is next to
GOD-liness.

6. “Everyone seems to be
wearing a uniform of khakis,
top-siders and alligator shirts.”’
Shhh. Chances are the person to
whom you're talking has a
similar uniform all laid out and
waiting for him to “‘relax”’ into
when he gets home. Right after
coming back from a Dr. Futch
class wearing his suit and tie.

Spanish Drama Memorable

After being in attendance at
the Monday night performance
of the Spanish troupe of Carmen
Keymann and others, one ma-
jor thought comes to mind. Why
isn’t more of this type of drama
done at Washington and Lee?
The audience at the Troubadour
was most appreciative as
regards the unique form of
theatre, unlike any available in
the United States. Speaking
briefly, the troupe’s presenta-
tion was a perfect example of a
total theatre experience:
visually, orally, emotionally...

The hour-long show was com-
prised of four short sketches,
each dealing with the important
Spanish theme of honor (a con-

cept certainly not foreign in this
community).

The first related the tale of a
miller, a mayor, and their
respective wives. In a com-
plicated series of events, they
go to bed with the other’s spouse
(complicated?). In  counter-
point to this serious study was
lighter examination of marital
fidelity — this time by use of a
puppet, quizzed by the cloaked
puppeteer on the actions of his
wife.

The probable highlight of the
entire show was a farce foe pup-
pets by Garcia Lorca. The tale
of the drunk Don Christobel and
his wife Rosita, who on her wed-
ding night (due to the drunken
state of her husband) turns to
four other men for satisfaction.

I’m sure we've all heard, at
one time or another, from many
members of the previous
generation, that today’s enter-
tainment world is nothing more
than glorified trash. We are
constantly told that the music is
repetitive, idiotic, toneless, and
totally lacking in artistic quali-
ty; that the artists who record
records are worthless in an in-
dustry where it seems everyone
is a star; that today’s television
is a witless reflection of the il-
literate society it plays to; that
the movie industry could never
hope to attain the achievements
in entertainment and fantasy

 

The Land of Oz

that were realized in the three
or four decades preceding 1960,
and that the stars—the Hep-
burns, Tracys, Bogarts, and
Garlands—are irreplaceable
remnants of the past.

In defiance of many of my
contemporary elders, I must
declare that we have much to be
proud of in the performing arts.
I wouldn’t be ashamed to com-
pare a Paul McCartney, Robert
Lamm, Paul Williams, or
Michele LeGrande (if these
names seem_ unfamiliar,
perhaps it’s because you
haven’t made the effort to ex-
perience the ‘Young’ and
‘“‘New’’ before’ basing

THE NOSE KNOWS

Fireworks galore! The E.C.
meeting was a trip and a half.
I’ve never seen so much
fireworks since a certain SAE
freshman voted in favor of the
Spinners vs. Peter Frampton.
Speaking of the E’s, we hear
that their diplomat from Little
Rock was arrested for indecent
exposure in Lexington. Rumor
has it it was somewhere near
VMI...kinky! Sort of reminds us
of last year when Mr. Alabama
shot the old woman at Hollins in
the face with a fire ex-
tinguisher. Congratulations
SAE pledges, boy are you in for
a good time.

Some of the SAB from last
year as well as this year were
present at the E.C. fiasco. Ab-
sent was our little friend. He
had a previous engagement to
pour tea at Dr. Simpson’s gala
opening of DuPont Art Gallery.
Our favorite artist was there
wearing her favorite dress, as
always. Alsé present were those
two dogs.

I was snooping around Du-
Pont annex(sculpture studio)
the other night and I came up
with some very interesting
photos of naked students. That’s
funny, I didn’t see that in the

‘

catalogue.

A certain IFC official is runn-
ing rush quite, well... Right into
the ground. Whatever happened
to the days of Alfred and “‘who
cares?”

The editor of the Phi was
trashpicking again and came up
with several checks from the
cockpit signed by a whiskered
ex-SAB czar. This ought to be
exciting.

Dean Diddle’s boy dean made
his first appearance at the IFC
meeting. He came, he saw, he
talked. No one listened.

Students should not loot the
new library building. I’ve never
seen so many bookcases in
Wood’s Creek Apts. before. On-
ly eleven more days till Eddie
the Ax’s son dissappears from
campus. It seems as if this
same lock and key laden lad
was scheduled as the main at-
traction at a dinner party last
week. The party, however, only
attracted the host and one ex-
tremely thirsty friend. No
RSVP for that guest of honor.

hesitate to put Leonard Berns-

higher) as George Gershwin.

Likewise, the movies are by
no means forever gone, and
Kathleen Quinlan, Robert
DeNiro, Dustin Hoffman, and
Lisa Minelli (in her own right),
among others, can all hold their
heads high in any discussion
concerning talent—past or pre-
sent. In addition, this past year
we have been given many
superb productions, some of
which include ‘‘Rocky,”’ “New
York, New York,” ‘‘Network,”
(just to mention a few).

However, before the contem-
porary generation can claim all
it deserves, it must learn to
recognize the worthless idiocy
that our seniors claim to be our
total diet.

Kirshner has been aroun

he has learned to disregard any
respect for art in order to find
success through pure commer-
cialism.

Our man Don doesn’t deviate
an inch from this philosophy for
this latest endeavor. After
witnessing a second rate per-
formance of black-style jazz
dancing—done to the theme
from “Rocky’—we are told
that this year’s award has been
named the ‘“‘Rocky’s” (sorry
Elvis fans). Then we are
presented Olivia ‘‘My-Face-
Alone-Will-Sell-A-Million-
Copies’? Newton-John, and
Peter Frampton (oops! Talent!
Ya Slipped There Don!), who
tell us the awards are given by
the artists themselves. Various
guests come and go, including
Dolly Parton, who is trying to
go total pop superstar, and
whose agent must have worked
like hell to get her the spot.
There is an appearance by
“Star Wars’’’s R2D2, who has a
conversation with Frampton
that would make Peter Pan
barf. Olivia and Frampton
seemed to go out of their way to
let people know that they were
reading cue cards, although
that seemed to distract the
viewer from the hideousness of
the dialogue.

More trash to think about:
Columbia’s “‘You Light of My
Life’’ rose to the second highest
grossing film last week after
debuting three weeks ago at
Number Nine...Johnny Carson
says that the new TV season is
as exciting as Anita Bryant ata
stag party...Andy Gibb will
have the number one record for
1977...See ‘Smokey and the
Bandit” (State) for fun, and
‘Cousin Cousine’’ (Lyric) for a
good movie.

 

Bizarre, but enjoyable.

The troupe is on the last leg of
a tour begun this summer, spon-
sored by the Foreighn Ministry
of Spain, and will circle that
southeast before returning to
their home base in Madrid. In
concluding, it is perhaps best to
echo the words of Mr. Laurent
Boetsch of W&L’s Spanish
department. In his introduction
of the group, he said, ‘The new
government of Spain’s Juan
Carlos could not have sent bet-
ter ambassadors to the U.S.’ At
the end of the performance,
many present agreed.

If you don’t have to worry
about the bad effects of a
sunburn you'll have a better
time at outdoor sports. A
good tanning or sun-blocking
lotion, however, doesn’t solve
all your problems. Sun and
wind can be very drying, so
a moisturizer, such as Tan
Care After Tanning Lotion
by Coppertone, is a good
thing to use when you get
home. It helps prevent flak-
ing and peeling—and keeps
your tan much longer.

Three

Winners

by Hugh Sisson

Among the more interesting
new releases is an album on the
Arista label entitled ‘‘Happy
The Man”’ by a new group of the
same name. The music is pro-
gressive featuring some ex-
cellent keyboard work not
unlike Genesis or Yes, yet the
overall sound is not an imita-
tion. This is an exciting new
sound incorporating some old,
familiar elements in a new for-
mat. Recommended!

Also in the progressive vein
but more accessible than their
earlier work is the new Gentle
Giant album, “‘Missing Piece.”
If you’ve like their music in the
past, you ought to give this one
a listen, and if you’ve never
heard of them before, now is the
time to open your ears. This
band was been around a long
time and they have managed to
create a unique sound in the
rock world.

Lastly for jazz _ lovers
(especially piano) are two new
releases from Keith Jarrett:
“Staircase” and ‘‘Byablue.”’
“Staircase” presents Jarrett at
his best in solo piano improvisa-
tion making for truly pleasant
and imaginative listening.
‘“‘Byablue,” on the other hand,
features some of the best small
accoustic jazz combo playing to
be had these days. Jarrett is one
of our most productive talents
in jazz.

Monkey Island
Geils
Atlantic SD 19103

Having finally seen Geils in
concert (stealing the show from
Peter Frampton, incidentally),
it’s easy to see why the group
has such a devoted following.
Live, they’re one of the tightest
bands around, and one of the
most exciting as well. Lead
singer Peter Wolf has seeming-
ly limitless energy onstage,
twisting, jumping, and dancing
in a manner that would do
justice to Mick Jagger. Un-
fortunately, Geils (formerly the
J. Geils Band) has frequently
had difficulties transferring

this excitement to vinyl. Their
Studio albums have always
seemed to be mere shadows of
their live records and concerts.

This is not so with Monkey
Island, perhaps because Geils’
latest LP represents a bit of a
change in style for the band.
The basic Geils sound is
definitely there, butsome of the
‘get up and boogie’ feeling has
been replaced by a more laid-
back style. In addition, the
band’s always excellent in-
strumentals are event better
than usual on this LP, and are
slightly more complex. The title
track is an excellent example of
this more interesting  in-
Strumental style. After a
reggae-ish intro segment, the
band builds slowly to each
chorus, finally moving into a
rousing rock & roll finale
(complete with the famous
Geils saxaphone). With
somewhat eerie lyrics and
vocals to top it off, “Monkey
Island’’ ranks as one or the best
things Geils has done to date.

Diehard Geils fans shouldn’t
feel betrayed, though. Monkey
Island also contains plenty of
the good-time music for which
this band is best known. The
album’s best cuts in this
category are “Surrender” and
“So Good,”’ a couple of tunes
which you can’t just sit still and
listen to. In short, this record’s
got something for everyone,
from slow stuff to dancin’ music
to good old rock & roll. Highly
recommended.

Best of Styx
Styx
Wooden Nickel BWL1-2250
Don’t let the title fool you.
This album is definitely not the
best of Styx. It was released by
the band’s original label,
Wooden Nickel, in the hope of
cashing in on Styx’ recent suc-
cess at A&M. The only thing on
the album which most people
will recognize, in fact, is the
1974 platinum single “Lady.”
Still, if you’re into basics, no-
frills rock & roll, you'll pro-
bably enjoy this LP. Several
songs, particularly ‘‘Southern
Woman’’ and ‘‘Man of
Miracles,’’ rank among the best
rockers Styx has ever done, and
when it comes to straight-ahead
rock & roll, this band is better
than most. If you want thebest
of Styx, though, buy Equinox.

Klaatu
Capitol ST-11633

Remember Klaatu? They’re
the band that came out with the
mysterious debut LP that
sounded so Beatles-ish (in
places) that some people
thought in might actually be
John, Paul, George, and Ringo,
back together under a different
name. The group was finally
revealed to be, not the Beatles,
but a bunch of Toronto studio
musicians (no doubt a disap-
pointment to fans of the Fab
Four, but they can always start
another reunion rumor).

“‘When is it going to come out
in paperback?’ We hear this
question nearly every day. The
answers are as varied as the
contracts which were drawn up
before today’s bestsellers were
published.

The sale of the paperback
rights is big business these
days, often conducted at lively
auctions where millions of
dollars are bid for the right to
turn hardback successes into
paperback fortunes.

Often there is a long delay
between the auction and the
time when the paperback edi-
tion is available for the
Bookstore’s shelves. But if you
are prepared to wait, these are

has obviusly worked hard to

more complex, highly or-

Musically, this band seems to
be able to do almost anything,
although some of their more
bizarre overdubs and _ intro

(not to mention their lyrical
preoccupation with outer

though, Klaatu is quite talented
and (on this album) highly
original. An excellent bet if

Davidson trounces
the Generals

by Pete Abitante

What happens when you allow
a team to run rampant for the
first quarter and a half of a foot-
ball game? They score 28
points, the margin of victory,
that’s what happens! If you
take away the first 19 minutes
of the Generals game with
Davidson College last Saturday,
W&L played a 14-14 tie. But add
the first quarter and the first
four minutes of the second
period and you will find that the
Wildcats went on to win their
first home game since 1974,
42-14.

Capitalizing early and often,
Davidson scored on _ four
straight possessions within the
opening 19 minutes. The first of
these came when Pete Legler
took a Syd Farrar punt and rac-
ed 83 yards for a score. David-
son recovered two General
fumbles on successive series
and drove 44 and 39 yards
respectively for two more
touchdowns. Farrar’ was
smothered while attempting to
punt on the next series, thus set-
ting up the Wildcats final score
of the disastrous’ span,
culminating on a one yard
plunge by fullback Page Walley
six plays later.

Six minutes into the second
period W&L scored its first
touchdown on a 6 yard run
around left end by freshman
Karl Cheatham. A Ted Hissey
pass to Richie Wiles completed
the two point conversion, mak-
ing the score 28-8 at the half.

Although the General’s
defense shut out Davidson in the
third period, the offense failed
to convert on two golden op-
portunities. Twice they had the

ball inside the Wildcat 10 yard
line but were unable to punch it
in, once being intercepted in the
end zone and the other time los-
ing the ball on downs.

While the defense could not
have looked better in the third
peiod, they could not have
played any worse in the first
half. A porous W&L front allow-
ed the Wildcats to amass a team
record 442 yards rushing on 68
carries. Add 68 yards passing,
and Davidson ran up an incredi-
ble 510 yards total offense. Pete
Legler led all rushers with 125
yards on 14 carries. In addition,
he returned two punts for 88
yards and one touchdown.

The Generals exhibited some
offensive spark though, mostly
on the passing of Ted Hissey
who was named offensive
player of the week. Hissey com-
pleted 16 of 25 passes for 173
yards while running for 26
more. W&L put together
several sustained drives as
evidenced by their total offense
production of 289 yards and
time of possession of nearly 29
minutes. Another bright spot
was the punting of Syd Farrar.
He punted four times for a 46.3
average, with a 60 yarder his
longest.

At this point in a yet young
season, it may seem that this is
the General team of old — in-
consistent offense, sporadic
defense and poor specialty-
team play. While definite
mistakes and lapses have been
made in these vital categories,
this team is not a ‘‘remnant”’ of
the past.

In their opening game of the
year, the Generals fared well
against Lock Haven State and

Dave William’s lone goal in
the first overtime of last Sun-
day’s match against Virginia
Wesleyan won the Va. Wesleyan
Tournament for the Generals
and gave them their best early
season record, 2-0, since 1969.
Coach Piranian was quick to
point out that he felt the most
significant factor in the team’s
victories was ‘team effort.’’
That may be true, but it’s also
been a long time since W&L’s

defense has played so well in
two consecutive games.

For the first game of the tour-
nament W&L faced Elon Col-
lege. Saturday’s contest saw the
Generals dominate every phase
of the game as the kickers
defeated Elon 5-0. W&L’s
scorers in the first game were
Dave Williams, Doug Dorsey,
Todd Tyson, Bill Stone, and
Shawn Levesque. All five points
were assisted. Sunday’s match

game. This past week, W&L
was outclassed by a_ well
disciplined wing-T division II
team from Davidson, North
Carolina. While losing, the
Generals have gained valuable
experience which should prove
to be excellent preparation for
the remaining games.

This week the Generals face

tucky. In the past this has pro-
ven to be an exciting game —
especially when played in Lex-

ington. The Colonels are an of-
fensive minded club, returning
33 starters from last year’s 5-4
squad.

W&L can definitely beat Cen-
tre but the outcome of the game
will depend on an inconsistent,
suspect defense. With co-
captain Jeff Slatcoff ques-
tionable due to injury, the
Generals will have to play . in-
spired defense with a minimum
of mistakes. Similarly, the of-

more of a contest. Virginia
Wesleyan, having practiced
longer than any of the other
teams in the tournament,
disposed of Roanoke by a score
of 3-1. Playing in familiar sur-
roundings with all too familiar
referees it is not surprising that
Va. Wesleyan pressured the
Generals during the entire
game. Some excellent goal-
keeping managed to hold Va.
Wesleyan scoreless, even
though they outshot the
Generals. In this match par-
ticularly the middies showed
signs of weariness, failining to
dominate play in the midfield as
they had done in the previous
contest.

Williams, a sophomore mid-
fielder, scored the winning goal
with two minutes remaining the
first of two ten minute overtime
periods. Tournament rules re-
quired that both overtime
periods be played. Williams
scored the winning goal from 20
yards out in a one on one situa-
tion with the Virginia Wesleyan
goalie. For Williams’ outstan-
ding play he was rewarded by
being named co-MVP of the Va.
Wesleyan Tournament.

But Piranian felt all along
that his team would prevail. He
said, ‘I expected to win. We
beat them soundly in an indoor
tournament last year. I’m sur-
prised they were as good as
they were.”

Piranian sees some very
positive signs in last weekend’s
victory. He cited the fact that
after two games the Generals
have had eight players involved
in scoring, compared to only
nine players for the entire ‘76
season. ‘‘Perhaps the most im-
portant asset,” says Piranian,
“is the fact that the players
believe in themselves. Last
year it seemed like everything
we did went wrong. These early
season wins give us the right at-
titude.”’

This Saturday’s away match
against Radford could be as dif-
ficult as the General’s match
against Va. Wesleyan. Rand-
ford is an erratic team, which
seems to raise the level of its
play to the calibre of its op-
ponents.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The liberal arts education, an idea developed and
cherished by the ancient scholars, died of an in-
curable illness: specialization.

Until recently, I probably would have still believed
in a liberal arts education and would have been sure it
existed at Washington and Lee. The unfortunate
tramas of drop-add have radically changed my opi-
nion.

My own experience coupled with similar tales from
fellow classmates has led me to the conclusion that
the liberal arts education discussed in the W&L
course catalog is only a facade for a traditional in-
stitution that is nothing more than a trade school.

Professors and advisors alike preach that the in-
famous concept of distribution credits is the basis for
a liberal arts education; however, prossibly they fail
to realize that these requirements are basically just
academically harder versions of high school
equivalents. Many students I’ve talked to, have ex-
pressed the opinion that they would go to great ex-
tents to be enrolled in more specialized, upper level
courses; however, they don’t have the time or room in
their tight academic schedules to be bothered by the
sometimes-trivial academic prerequisites.

Still others say the work load required for their ma-
jor leaves them without any time to take courses out-
side their chosen field of study. Others have reported
that they are willing to take a prerequisite course
with the intent of gaining the rewards of higher level,
more specialized courses, but the prerequisites
sometimes consist of either two courses or of one
course that lasts two semesters.

The professors claim the problem is overcrowding:
rumors state that 75 per cent of this year’s freshman
class will study in the Commerce School. The pro-
fessors claim extra students increases their work
load: they don’t mention the student’s work load. The
professors claim the quality of education is
hampered: possibly true, but without allowing truly
interested students—especially seniors in their
educational twilight—in these classes, the quality of
education for these upperclassmen will also be
hampered.

It is true that in many cases upper level courses and
professors skim over information learned by their
students from prerequisite courses—the courses un-
doubtedly must be retained to maintain a quality
education. But over the past four years, I’ve seen the
art of education become so defined that second
semester freshmen must practically declare their
majors so they can begin this specialization process.

Washington and Lee enjoys the reputation of being
a fine liberally educating school. Despite its political
conservatism and Wall Street walking population, it
just seems a shame that truly interested students are
unable to take advantage of this asset.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry

 

Frats backed

To the editors:

It is my intention with this let-
ter to disagree with a few key
points submitted editorially
concerning fraternity rush in
the Sept. 16 issue. I am a
freshman, and I have already
pledged a fraternity, but this is
only half of my reasoning.

I feel that if rush was postpon-
ed until the winter term frater-
nities would have already
wooed the freshmen they con-
sidered ‘“‘sure things,” and
would wage a silent war for the
remaining 95 per cent of the
class. Each frat would par-
ticipate in a can-you-top-this
war, with a disasterous result.
So much money would be spent
on alcohol (even cokes) and
entertainment that the frats
would party themselves to
fiscal death, ruining the system
for everybody. Personally, I
was glad to get all the open
houses behind me before school
started. Two parties on Friday
night are OK too, but if we had
to start all the open houses in
winter, think how tired and
disgusted the frat members
would be, as well as the
freshmen, confronted with all
this mess in the heart of our
academic effort.

I attended ten open houses
and several unofficial house
parties, and I met hundreds of
people. I found the fraternity
for me--one that respects my
opinions, yet does not let a dif-
ference of opinion obstruct a
friendship. Let me submit that
the ‘facades’ of the frat
members are lifted after the
rushee becomes a pledge. I was
apprehensive at first, but I soon
learned that my frat is just as
courteous under no pressure as
they seemed to be when I was
rushed. I feel a survey of all
pledges in the various frater-
nities would support my
hypothesis. After three weeks of
intense soul-searching, one can
make an intelligent choice of
the fraternity which is right for
him. As far as I am concerned,
the pressure is off, and I can
begin serious concentration on
my studies. Would I be able to
do this in the middle of the
academic year? I think not.

Sincerely,
Sam H. Campbell, ’81

 

Phi, Goddard criticized

Editor:

As a member of both this
year’s and last year’s SAB, I
feel that I cannot leave the
allegations charged in last
week’s R.T.P. unchallenged.

I do not feel that it is the
policy of the Journalism depart-
ment of this school to create
prototypes of Watergate
reporters a la Woodward and
Bernstein. Certainly when a
student has a questionable
honor violation he does not rush
down to the Lexington News-
Gazette to let the entire com-
munity eavesdrop on the situa-
tion. He checks out the facts
before he brings them to the
proper authorities.

I am not saying that the issue
of alleged improprieties should
not have been investigated and
reported; it should have—
within proper bounds. One
should not accuse a student
group of “‘massive unauthoriz-
ed expenditures,”’ ‘‘mismanag-
ed money,” and “regular
private parties at student fund’s
expense’ without proper
documentation. I feel I must
charge Mr. Goddard with
reckless accusation without
proper documentation. The
RTP should also be criticized
for failure to cross-check Mr.
Goddard’s ‘informed source”’
and his ‘‘facts.””

The E.C. did investigate the

matter and substantiated one
charge, the housing loan to
Charles Hulfish by then co-
chairman John Berley. The
loan was between those two in-
dividuals and was not voted
upon nor approved by the SAB
as a body. Most members, in-
cluding myself, did not even
know about the loan. Both par-
ties admitted wrongdoing and
never tried to conceal the loan
at any time. That loan was
repaid with interest before the
RTP went to print and before
the E.C. began their investiga-
tion. None of the other claims of
“unauthorized disbursements
of money’”’ were substantiated.

It is hoped that this year’s
SAB will be cleared from the
mistakes of last year’s SAB,
alleged or otherwise. That the
SAB was guilty of poor or slop-
py bookkeeping is not to be
denied; that they be charged
with embezzlement by implica-
tion of distorted facts is another
matter altogether.

It is a serious thing to ques-
tion a man’s integrity based on
unfounded allegations. I hope
that the nature of the article
and allegations is not a reflec-
tion of the personal integrity of
Mr. Goddard or the staff of the
R.T.P.

Sincerely,
William B. Tucker ‘79

Undergrad “Untouchables”

accused by master race

Dear editor:

It is with deep regret that I
feel the need to write this letter.
I have been a student at this
university for over a year now,
and have been disappointed, to
say the very least, with the
school’s’ so-called ‘‘honor
code.’’ An incident last weekend
has upset me to the point that I
must express my views public-
ly.
Last Saturday night I parked
my green Pinto station wagon
on the road which bends around
the Woods Creek Apartments,
leading toward the site of the
new library. The next day two
of my classmates alerted me
that my car had been damaged.
And indeed it had been, after I
had parked it. The left rear
quarter panel was scraped and
pushed in, and the rear bumper
was bent, with one of the moun-
ting brackets nearly pulled out
from the body. No note or any
indication of who had hit me
was present. It was no small
dent.

The sad part is that I have
very little doubt that the acci-
dent was caused by an
undergraduate. The law school
student body is simply of a
higher caliber. One of my
classmates would have told me
that he had hit me, but not an
undergraduate. It is just
another example of the wanton
carelessness I have witnessed
on the part of the
undergraduate student body.
The law students are simply a

most of us never had any
‘“‘honor code’’ when we went to
college. My school, Albion Col-

Editorial Note: Odd that you
should close your letter with the
word ‘‘disgusting.’’ This was

honor code, and I was not the
victim of a single theft or act of
v.ndalism in my four years
there. In little over a year in the
‘*Southern Gentlemen’s
school,’ I have had my car
damaged or vandalized twice,
had a textbook stolen and was
also involuntarily relieved of a
box which contained my stereo
speakers. (The speakers were,
fortunately, not in the box at the
time).

And what does the E.C. do
about such acts? I am not ask-
ing for any investigation, but
with the exception of the law
school representative (i.e. Rick
Goddard), this astute body
seems to content itself with
reprimanding students who get
drunk and steal $1.50 worth of
cheese from a local grocery
store. At the same time, the
E.C. does nothing to discourage
the reckless and immature
behavior which reached _ its
peak last year when a student
was sauteed by _ his

“gentlemen” friends at a
fraternity party. Absolutely
unbelievable’

The last part of this letter is
directed at the person who hit
my car. Come and tell me. You
won’t have to be put up against
the E.C. The honor code is not
my system. If you do come and
tell me, my regard for you per-
sonally and for the school in
general will be_ greatly
heightened.

I guess the moral of the story
is this: at Washington and Lee
boys will be boys, but men (and
capable women) will be law
students.

Big stuff from Big Lex

by Ben W. Keesee

Being one of many naive,
idealistic, pristine and budding
geniuses referred to as
freshman, upon my arrival at
Washington and Lee this fall I
was faced with finding the
answers to many a festering
question. As most others, I
found the most pressing puzzle
to be: ‘‘What in the hell does
Ring-tum Phi mean? ‘‘Inspired
by curiosity, I began my quest
for the answer.

First, I stopped by the Ring-
tum Phi office. ‘‘Surely one of
the slick, sophisticated, omnis-
cient, pros of college newspaper
journalism can provide the

answers,” I thought. With a

trembling fist, I knocked meek-
ly upon the staff’s office door.
Bellowed from within came the
slightly less than hospitable
reply, ‘‘Screw this crapola, so-
meone see what that mother at
the door wants.”

As the door opened, I, com-
pletedly void of self-confidence,
half walked, half stumbled into
the room. In total awe of the
dramatic presence of true-to-
life editors, I said not a word.
My eyes first met those of a
bushy-haired, football type,
whom I recognized as_ the

Editor-in-Chief! Politely, with
exceptional understanding of
the lowly freshman’s plight, he
attempted to encourage my
speaking by musically
beseeching, ‘‘Whatever you
want, make it fast. We got work
to do.”’

Timidly I ventured, ‘Mr.
Editor, sir, could you please tell
me what the name of your
newspaper means?” In an-
ticipation of the shock of
recognition, I waited for his rep-
ly. The Editorials Editor, with
his jaw set and eyes fixed in-
tently on his page, asserted,
“What do we care, nobody
reads the damn thing any way?
Get out of here and leave us
alone!”

With stars in my eyes, blinded
by the brilliance of raw profes-
sionalism, I left the room.

I found myself intent on
distinquishing myself from the
thousands of other W&L
freshmen with journalistic
tendencies who vie to realize
their lifelong dream of winning
the lucrative position of— Assis-
tant Copy boy for the RtP.

My angle was this: find the
answer to a mystery greater
than that of the mighty

Lexington’s “SILVER”

Lining Remembered

by Ned McDonnell

In every city or town, there
are people who help make up its
character. Andrew Carnegie
certainly helped Pittsburgh at-
tain the dubious distinction of
being America’s “Smokey Ci-
ty.” Baron Van Haussmann
converted Paris from a dingy
medieval city to a spectacular
metropolis with wide
boulevards and breathtaking
panoramas. These men, for
their achievements, became
legends in their own time.

Although Lexington has had
more than its fair share of Con-
federate generals, no one has
had more impact on the
present-day character of this
community than Arthur Silver.
Yes, that’s right, Arthur Silver,
the elderly gentleman who
walks down the “Main’’ Street
he has grown to adore over the
last 52 years. Yes, the same Ar-
thur Silver who seems to know
something about everyone’s
hometown; a practical fringe
benefit of his earlier stage
career.

Arthur Silver, acclaimed a
living legend five times over the

years, yearns to remain in the -

public eye. He does an adequate
job of preserving his esteemed
status by singing love ballads,
cracking jokes, and occasional-
ly dropping in on fraternity par-
ties.

Silver has the past of a hustl-
ing comedian, the present of a
general bonvivant, and the
future of a mellowing legend.
Born in 1890 in Ohio, Silver look-
ed to show business for his
career. Starting at 15 singing
ragtime love ballads in a
Cleveland moving picture
showplace, Silver soon started
touring nationwide on _ the
vaudeville circuit. But around
1925, poisoned kidneys forced
Silver into the Johns Hopkins
Medical Center and out of show
business. After convalescing in
Lexington, the former actor
opened Arthur Silver’s Clothes
Shop.

“Big Art’? adapted to Lex-
ingtonians the hard way. One
day at a football game in 1928,
Arthur neglected to stand for a

_ rendition. of the. W&L .Swing.

After a smack on the head from
a drunk upperclassman mistak-
ing the taylor for an impudent
freshman, Silver learned the
Swing within a day. As Lex-
ington expanded from three
stores in the roaring 20’s, so did
Silver’s reputation as a comical
salesman of avant-garde
clothes ranging from the first

denims stocked in the area to .

the craziest hats in town.

Had Silver been able to sell
his comedy, he would have
made millions. But the hap-
piness of people’s laughter
satisfied him. Totally serene, at
least on the outside, and know-
ing each day was another day of
life, Silver managed to ascribe,
in the manner of John Donne,
sexual connotations to peanut
butter.

The happy-go-lucky haber-
dasher still has the sharp mind
of his younger days. Recently
the wives of two W&L students
entered his establishment with
an enframed “living lengend”’
article and asked him to explain
‘‘peanut butter legs.’’ Realizing
he shouldn’t tell the ladies the
truth, he deftly sidestepped the
quandary by saying that
‘‘peanut butter lets’’ belonged
to those women who were
pigeon-toed and who shuffled as
if they were walking in peanut
butter.

Two years ago, Arthur, en-
cumbered by sagging sales,
closed his store. Similar to the
fate of Packards, vintage
Bordeaux wines, and other
carefully crafted luxuries of
yesteryear, the popularity of
customed tailored clothing had
given way to cheaper mass-
produced clothes. Despite the
loss of his friendly service and
an antiquated concept of
clothing, the Arthur Silver of
half a century has remained.
Holding a condom in a clenched
fist and signing ‘‘He’s got the
whole world in his hand,”’ Silver
proves he’s still a pro at the
“‘art’’ he founded in Lexington;
blowing out young females.
Aside from the naughty jokes,
Arthur has all but monopolized
the Rockbridge area one liner
market. Silver brilliantly turn-
ed away an aggressive lady’s
question, ‘‘What is life without a

family?”” by snapping im-
pudently, ‘‘Quiet.”’

But the humor, the love and
faith in other people, the attach-
ment to Lexington, the serenity,
and the myriad of other
qualities that make him a
legend are fading in the old
man. Seriously contemplating
leaving Lexington, grimaces
slash across Art’s wisened face
when he thinks about the pre-
sent attitudinal state of the
American people. He feels that
Americans have become
‘“‘meaner”’ since the mid-1960’s.
Silver shudders at the extent to
which his compatriots ‘‘chase
the greenback’’; a psyche he
feels reflects the superficial
mentality of this country as it
enters it third century.

Lexingtonians who have not
had the fortune of meeting this
vast goldmine of experiences,
nostalgia, and advice may
dispute the validity of the legen-
dary proportions of Arthur
Silver. But those few of us who
have grown to know Silver,
have found this model of
earlier, less frenetic, more
sincere years that are lost
forever very refreshing indeed
pacifying as we face a highly
specialized and_ highly
pressurized world which may or
may not overwhelm us. If the
legend leaves, the legacy,
already engulfing Lexington
like an amoeba, of generosity
both material and spiritual will
permeate this town, the jokes
will still fly, and the strong 87-
year-old voice will still ring in
our ears. Lexington will still be
the same but will simultaneous-
ly lack something; something
indescribable that it once had.

ROTC events planned

While most of the student
body spent their summer bask-
ing in the sun or working at the
beach, ROTC students in the ad-
vanced program sweated it out
in the confines of Fort Bragg,
North Carolina. But now school
is back in session and the W&L
ROTC department is back to
fun and games with some new
events and a number of new
staff members.

Already members of ROTC
and a number of other students
have participated in the Slide-
For-Life and rappelling ac-
tivities offered by the depart-
ment. But the big event to date
was a canoe trip for novices
down the James River. And
there are plenty more offered
during the school year including
mountaineering and the annual
FTX. All of these activities are
open to the student body and
participation is encouraged.
Any inquiries should be
directed to Major Adams at
Ext. 242 or 463-4730

The department has a lot of
new faces since last year’s PMS
Col. McFadden, Major Kutter,
Captain Miller and Sgt. Wilson
have now left the staff. The new
PMS is LTC Davis with other
members of the staff including
Captain Long, MSG Johnson
and Captain Singleton.

On a note of accomplishment,
four W&L ROTC cadets suc-
cessfully completed training in
the prestigious Army Basic Air-

borne School, or as it is more
commonly known, jump school.
Freeman Jones (Junior), Mike
Cleary (Senior), Charles

Big Brother wants you

There will be a mandatory
orientation meeting Tuesday,
Sept. 27 at 7:30 p.m. for anyone
interested in working for the
various University Federation
programs. The programs are:
Big brother/big sister, tutor-
ing, Western State, winter
clothing drive, cub scout pro-
gram and Reach-Out.
Psychology students are
reminded to attend if they want
to obtain extra credit from their
professors. Anyone unable to at-
tend should send a friend over
to sign up for him or contact
Rick Stein or Mark Broughton.
Stein is head of the U. F.

Broughton directs the big
brother program.

Here is a description of the
programs:

—Big Brother/big Sister:
The purpose of this program is
to help meet adequate attention
and caring. These children,
usually ranging in age from 9 to
18 are referred to the Federa-
tion by local schools or by agen-
cies, such as the Welfare and
the Probation Department.
After approval by the Big
Brother/Big Sister Board, the
volunteer is assigned to a child
or teenager whom he is to
meet on a regular basis. The
minimum commitment is that
the volunteer spend at least
three hours a week for the
academic year with his little
brother. It is helpful if the
volunteer has access to a car as
many volunteers choose to use
their time: helping the little
brother with his homework or
with learning a hobby or sport;
going on fishing trips, hiking, or
hunting trips; or attending local
sport events.

The Big Brother or Big Sister
receives supervision in his or

her work and meets periodical-
lv for consultation with others
in the program. Because of the
type children referred to this
program, this project is one of
the Federation’s most deman-
ding on the volunteer.

— Volunteer Work In The
School System (Tutoring): Ar-
rangements have been made
with the local elementary
schools for volunteers to assist
children who need extra help
with their schoolwork. The
schools, (Central, Waddell and
Lylburn Downing) are all in
walking distance of the W&L
campus.

The minimum commitment is
one hour a week for the
semester. The volunteer is not
expected to have any special
skills or knowledge except what
is expected of an _ entering
freshman. Teachers’ are
available to the volunteers to
help them in their work with the
children. However, the key to
the program is the type of rela-
tionship which the volunteer
develops with the children.
While most volunteers work
with individual children, there
are those often who want it to
take over part of a class. Last
year, this was the Federation’s
most popular program both
from the perspective of the
W&L volunteers and the
elementary school children.
—Western State-opportunity to
experience the complexities
and challenges of the Mental
Health field. Located in Staun-
ton, less than forty minute drive
from Lexington, Western State
is the State mental hospital for
this region of Virginia. It houses
a large variety of patients rang-
ing from those who have been
admitted on a short-term basis

mention an end of the year pic-
nic held for outgoing and incom-
ing SAB members. He said the
approximately $60 party for 30
people was the SAB’s way of
thanking its members for work-
ing so hard during the year. The
$60 did come out of SAB funds,
said Berley.

_ Concerning the records, Arm-
strong said they were filed in
triplicate: a copy to Washington
Hall, one to the E.C., and one
for the SAB’s files. He said that

it was obvious to him that God-
dard had not thoroughly check-
ed up on his sources before he
talked to the Phi.

Cappeto said that it was stan-
dard Washington and Lee pro-
cedure to keep only the
vouchers for record files. He
said technically speaking,
vouchers and receipts are not
the same thing, but here at
W&L the vouchers are used as
the receipts.

for tests and observations to
those hard-core patients who
have been hospitalized for a
long period of time.

The volunteer assumes a
minimum commitment to meet
once a week for three or four
hours with patients in the
hospital with the purpose of of-
fering them a degree of on going
support and companionship.
Each volunteer is given profes-
sional supervision in his work,
as well as opportunities for ad-
ditional work. Also, in some
cases, students enrolled in
Psychology courses can ar-
range to do some class projects
in conjunction with the pro-
gram.

Transporation is organized by,
car pools so that having a car is
not necessary to join the pro-
gram.

—Winter Clothing Drive:
Many children in the Lexington
and Rockbridge area lack suffi-
cient clothing, a situation which
becomes particularly apparent
during the winter months. As a
response, we seek to raise
money for these needy children.
Volunteers raise money
through special projects which
complement the general fund
raising drive during the fall
term. The names of the needy
children are provided by the
local Welfare Department and
the Board of Education. Not all
the recipients are member of
“welfare” families as some of
the most critical cases concern
children whose parents are not
on welfare, but who, never-
theless, are too poor to clothe
their children. There is no par-
ticular commitment except the
determination to raise money
for the project.

—In the  Lexington-
Rockbridge County area there
are approximately five Cub
Scout dens. In these dens the
den mothers are over crowded
as there are usually nine or ten
boys per den mother. The W&L
student’s job is to help her coor-
dinate programs and set up ac-
tivities for these boys. The den
mothers encourage you to ex-
press and use your imagination
for the various planned ac-
tivities. There is one meeting
per week and it is about an hour
and a half long.

—Reach-Out: A _ program
directed by Dr. Worth involving
crisis counseling over the
phone. Please contact Dr.
Worth for further information.

All the programs, except the
Big Brother program, require
commitment for the entire
year. Big Brother requires a
commitment of a full school
year.

To accomplish this deed would
not only satisfy my personal in-
quiry, but also shoot me into the
top one hundred applicants be-
ing considered for a RtP job!
Pen and memo book in hand, I

marched to the library in’

search of my Holy Grail. To my
eventual surprise and delight,
aided by the efforts of two
devastatingly beautiful and
equally sensuous librarians, I
found a lead. I was immediately
off to the archives of majestic
McCormick. Deep into the dark,
cavernous bowels I climbed,
waiving away cobwebs with one
hand and the amorous
librarians with the other until at
last I found them. There among
the rats and the choking dust

lay the Lost Sea Scrolls of -

Washington and Lee, volumes 2
and 11 of the ‘Alumni
Magazine.”

After putting on the kid gloves
handed me by one of the
librarians, I removed the
volumes, dried and yellowed
with age, to the reference room
where lighting was more
suitable. And after hours and
days of tireless reading,
research, and note taking, I
have developed the first
authoritative source explaining
concisely, in 18 volumes, the
origin of the name Ring-tum
Phi.

After a quick trip to Jiffy
Publishing and Printing, I
returned once again to the RtP
office, this time with my
masterpiece. Volumes under
arm, I pounded upon the door,
giving no time for reply, I
entered the room as the ex-
plorer returning to his queen
with the news of plentiful new
lands discovered in her name
and honor. ‘‘Here is the answer,
the light, the word!”’ I shouted.
After reading the volumes. the
editors fell to their knees, ex-
tolling my supreme and
ultimate power over the
English language and the writ-
ten word, pledging their infinite
effort and service to my will.
Humbly I bid them to stand and
as a gesture of my unique kind-
ness and nobleness, assured
each one he could maintain his
position of lowliness in ex-
change for my being appointed
to the coveted post of Intermit-
tent Freshman Correspondent.

brief ceremony, I made my ex-

it, crowned in a gray felt hat
with an attached card upon
which was emblazoned the
magic word “Press.” The
Editor-in-Chief then showed me
to my private news office fur-
nished with bar, waterbed and
librarians. I now live happily
forever after.

And for those of you who have
lasted through the brief in-
troduction to this news story, I
will summarize, briefly, my fin-
dings from the exhaustive study
I conducted.

The practical origin of the
phrase Ring-tum Phi is a
derivative of an ancient couplet
passed off as a football cheer at
athletic events by various
mellow fellows of W&L. The
cheer went as follows:

‘“Ring-tum Phi, Stickeri Bum,
We’re Hot Stuff From Lex-

ington!”

The newspaper adopted this
initial phrase, according to
some, after publishing several
heated editorial opinions which
resulted in major University
changes. This was a first in col-
lege journalism. Thus, the staff
found the phrase and it’s in-
ference an appropriate title.

The literal translation of the

phrase has been interpreted in
several different ways. The
most popular by far according
to classical scholars is this:
Ring is derivative of the Latin
verb ringo, meaning to snarl or
show one’s teeth or fangs. Ran-
dom House dictionary defines
the word tum as a verb, mean-
ing to tease, as applicable to
wool. And of course, the word
phi represents the twenty-first
letter of the Greek alphabet.
The combination of all these
meanings must mean one and
only one thing. The phrase at
the top of the Ring-tum Phi is a
disclaimer warning:
‘‘Although we like to snarl and
show our fangs, don’t let us
pull the wool over your eyes
with our teases. Acutally, we
can’t get past the twenty-first
letter of the alphabet!”’

A more detailed tracing, ac-
count, and description is
available in my complete work,
now on display at the Smithso-
nian Institute of Verbosity.

Volume LXXVII

 

by Fraser Humphreys and
Heartsill Ragon

For the first time in recent
history, Washington and Lee
students will have to experience
a “dry’.homecoming concert
according to Student Activities
Board co-chairman Bill Tucker.

Tucker said the SAB had been
trying to gain an extended tem-
porary Alcohol Beverage Con-
trol license for the entire Stu-
dent Center complex so that
beer could be served at the
dance and the students could
roam the halls with their
drinks. This arrangement,
Tucker said, would alleviate the
overcrowded conditions ex-
perienced at past dining hall
functions. If this agreement had
been reached, the Homecoming
concert and dance, featuring
Archie Bell and the Drells along
with Razz-a-Matz, would have
been held in Evans Dining Hall.

Tucker reported that the SAB
originally had planned to ask

Phi Kaps
fined $200

by Reid Slaughter

Only one major fine for rush
violations was levied by the IFC
after last week’s Judiciary
Board and Student Affairs Com-
mittee meetings; although two
other serious cases are still pen-
ding.

Phi Kappa Sigma _ was
ordered to pay a $200 fine for
serving beer at an Open House.
The fine, which was originally
only $100, was upped by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee on the
grounds that the violation was
“blatant and premeditated.”
On top of that, the Phi Kapps
were given another $25 fine for
late return of rushees.

In other minor violation

cases, both Sigma Chi and °
Lambda Chi were given $25
fines for late return of rushees,

regional ABC officials for an ex-
tention of the dining hall’s
beerserving permit. After SAB
consultations with ABC Agent
William T. Burnett, it was
decided that the SAB would not
press Burnett and the ABC for
an extention because, ac-
cording to Tucker, Burnett im-
plied W&L and the SAB had
been ‘“‘getting away with
purder’’ in their beer handling
practices during Fancy Dress.
After being virtually assured of
a visit from ABC officials and
running the risk of violating
ABC regulations, the SAB
decided not to apply for the ex-
tention.

Tucker reported that because
the license extention Was not
applied for, the concert and
dance will now be held in the
Old Doremus Gymnasium
beginning at 9 p’m. and will last
until approximately 1:00 a.m.

Tucker explained that the
location for the Friday night
dance was decided upon after
considerable debate and com-

Among the new faces on cam-
pus this year is the somewhat
bearded and amiable
countenance of Dr. Bell. Dr.
Bell comes to Washington and
Lee from England’s Oxford
University as part of an ex-
change program between the
two universities. The program,
which has sent our own Pro-
fessor LaRue (law department)
to Oxford for a term, was
primarily initiated and
engineered by Professor Jar-
rard of Washington and Lee’s
Psychology Department. In
Lexington only for the Fall
Term, Professor Bell will serve

as a member of the Geology

Department.

Professor Bell, born in

. Yorkshire, England, attended

and graduated from Trinity Col-
lege at Oxford University. Arm-
ed with a Doctorate in Geology,

:-Dr. Bell was sent to the Solomon

- %

Island as a member of the

9 scientific branch of England’s

‘Colonial Service. After two
years of service he returned to

England as a Research Assis-

tant in his Alma Mater’s
Geology Department. As a
Research Assistant, Professor
Bell’s interest in Geology car-
ried him on various expeditions
throughout the Northern
Hemisphere. More recently,
Dr. Bell has become a full-
fledged member of Oxford’s
faculty college, from whence he
comes to Washington and Lee.
Dr. Bell, a specialist in the

ment from the SAb, dining hall
and ABC officials.

According to Evans Dining
Hall manager Jerry Darrell,
the dining hall has never been a
suitable location for dances, in-
cluding Fancy Dress because of
the great amounts of uninten-
tional damage the Commons
facility experiences during
these activities. Managers for
Archie Bell and the Drells ruled
out use of Zollman’s Pavillion
because of some unpleasant
past experiences the band has
experienced there. Tucker add-
ed that “for your big Friday
night dance, the place is not
very classy.”

We thought of holding the
dance in the new gym,”’ Tucker
said, “but that ruled out danc-
ing as well as drinking which
brings us to the old gym. At
least we can dance there.”’

Because of tightened ABC
regulations, the SAB had to veto
the originally planned idea of
serving beer outside of the
Doremus Gymnasium doors.

Tucker reluctantly
acknowledged that the SAB
would “have to be stricter than
usual on those attempting to br-
ing booze into the gym due to
the fact that an ABC official
may be present. ‘“‘We have the
right to deny entry at the door
until it’s beyond a reasonable
doubt that a person isn’t br-
inging a bottle in.”

For those persons feeling
cheated out of an evening of em-
bibement, the opportunity to in-
dulge will be presented Satur-
day afternoon as the first of the
school year’s Grain Parties will
be conducted at Zollman’s
Pavillion from 3:30 to 6:30 p.m.

Sophmore Class President
Les Cotter has announced that
the afternoon’s festivities will

NUMBER 3

$56,000

requested

from EC

by Lee Howard

The yearly budget battle has
begun! More than $56,000 was
requested by nine student
organizations at Monday
night’s Executive Committee
meeting.

The Student Activities Board
made the largest request, ask-
ing for $33,850. That’s about 60
per cent of.all requests received
at the meeting, and about 50 per
cent of this year’s student fund.
Last year the SAB received
$32,260, which means the
organization is looking for a
$1,590 raise in appropriations.

In addition, co-chairmen
Charlie Hulfish and Bill Tucker
asked for “‘a one-time expense "
to improve the projector situa-
tion.” They said that they could
get two projectors and two
cinemascope lenses for approx-
imately $2,000. Hulfish said this
would be an extremely good
deal. E. C. president Jim
Underhill said he wants to see
the SAB purchase the new pro-

jectors and lenses regardless of
how much the E.C. decides to
appropriate for the SAB. The
reason for Underhill’s concern
is that, according to Hulfish,
cinemascope movies cannot be
shown until the SAB gets some
new projectors.

One of the major increases in
this year’s SAB budget will go

for more entertainment in the

five” nights per week of enter-
tainment, Tucker said. The
weekends will feature profes-
sional entertainers, while
weekdays will be reserved for
student acts playing for free
beer or some nominal fee like
$5, Tucker said. Also, the
Cockpit happy hours will be
partially financed by SAB
money, the co-chairmen said.
Student Bar

The Student Bar Association
requested $11,500. A large por-
portion of the money will go for
speakers at the Tucker Law
Forum, SBA President Ray
Leven said. He said some of the
money would also go to the
Women Law _ Student’s
Organization for speakers,
recruitment and surveys of
women’s attitudes toward the W
& L Law School. Additionally,
the Black American’s Law Stu-
dent Association would get
some money for speakers, he
said.

Pit Climbs Out
of Depths

by J. Michael Gallagher

“The Cockpit is becoming a
classier establishment,’’ ac-
cording to Cockpit Night
manager Dan Scott. He said a
higher quality of atmosphere
now exists in the Cockpit due to
the new menues, the new per-
sonnel who have provided bet-
ter service for W&L patrons,
and the nightclub atmosphere
that last week permeated the
establishment. It is for this last
reason that Scott announced the
formation of the Progessive
Music Club, which will have an
organizational meeting Thurs-
day at 8:00 p.m. in the music
practice room in the University
Center.

Scott said the purpose of the
club was to get student musi-
cians together to play and ex-
change ideas. The _ club
members would be given the op-
portunity to play in the Cockpit.
The members would also find
out the types of music the W&L
community wants to hear by
means of a survey of Cockpit
patrons, and play them. This
survey would also dictate the
type of music that would be
played in the jukebox. Scott in-
dicated that much of the out-
dated disco tunes would be
removed and replaced with
more recent popular tunes.

The club would also assume
ithe responsibility of booking
‘high quality acts into the ‘‘Pit”
during the weekend, according
to Scott. He said that not only
would the entertainers provide
the student body with high
quality entertainment; they
would also be a_ learning
medium for club members,
similar to the workshops held
by visiting string quartets for
the members of Mu Beta Psi,
the music society.

Scott concedes there is a
barrier to his ideas and hopes.
Presently, the SAB controls
who will play in the Cockpit,
and the money necessary for
funding the acts. For these
reasons, Scott will approach the
E.C. Monday with a budget re-
quest. He said, ‘‘For four years
now, I have watched the SAB
run the student activities on
campus, including the enter-
tainment in the Cockpit.
Homecoming is evidence of the
type of job they have done.

“‘They have hired Archie Bell
and the Drells for $2,200 and
Raz-a-Mataz for $1,200 for one
night. A top quality rock band
could have been hired for half
the price. There are more rock
bands on the market than soul,
and they cost less! It’s a matter
of supply and demand. There is
a contingent here who enjoy
soul music, but it is not per-
vasive enough to give the entire
student body a soul band for

Harriet Thomas.

 

A restored historic landmark with five period-furnished guest suites
AAA and COUNTRY INNS AND BACK ROADS. A different
experience in overnight hospitality for those who love fine things.
Students may make reservations for their parents and tour the
house from 10-5 daily. Wednesday until 2:00 or write Mrs.

50% more in price. That is why I
believe the club members
should be allowed to book acts
into the Cockpit. Afterall, who
are better judges of music than
musicians themselves?”’

Scott said the Cockpit in the
student center is for students
and should reflect what the
students want in the form of
entertainment. He said there
is no other outlet for students to
book entertainment acts except
through the SAB, whose
musical and entertainment
tastes he doesn’t trust. The
Cockpit was on the coffee house
circuit last year, Scott said, and
maybe one-half of the acts book-
ed into the pit were competent,
and one fourth were acts that
students were interested in see-
ing. He said there were no name
performers, and acts appeared
very infrequently. He pointed
out that last week there was an
act every night in the Cockpit
until Friday night when the SAB
took over the entertainment
responsibilities. Since then,
there has yet to be entertain-
ment in the Cockpit.

SAB co-chairman Bill Tucker
said that students playing in the
Cockpit is fine. But as far as
Students booking themselves
and other acts into the Cockpit,
he was against it. He also said
that paying the students with
student body funds was not
right in his opinion. He believes
the SAB should have control
over who and what acts appear
in the Cockpit.

Leven said the reason.he was
asking for $4,500 more money
than last year is that he feels
law students should have their
$20 per semester activity fee go
for activities law students are
interested in. He said that over
50 per cent of his class is mar-
ried and that married students
don’t get anything out of most of
the social activities that go on
around W&L.

When law students were in
Tucker Hall they received
about 65 per cent of the money
they put into the student fund,
Leven said. However, because
of the better facilities provided
by Lewis Hall, law students
want to try to use the entire
building as effectively as possi-
ble, he said. In order to do this,
he said, he wants to use approx-
imately 95 per cent of the funds
law students pay to the student
fund. According to George Grif-
fin, the law school contributes
$12,165 to the student fund.

As freshmen attempt to crawl
out of the sandbox of life, often
referred to as “‘high’”’ school,
and ensconce themselves in the
mud hole of egregious super-
profundity, (known as W&L to
all but a few gentlemen who
must refer to it as “that great
institution of higher learning:
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’) they begin to develop a
whole new vocabulary of |
euphemisms..

Example: ‘Bag it.” In high
school they would have said,
“But mommy, I don’t want to.”
The derivation of this phrase
appears to be Krogers, Va.

he said the E.C. should recom-
mend to the Board of Trustees
that the fee be raised to $25 per
term from the present $20 per
term. McNider said thet the
M.C. needs at least $300 this

year for operating expenses.
Calyx :

Calyx representative,

business manager Grant

Leister, said he will need $6,500
for the coming year. He asked
for $2,000 of the money right
away so Calyx can get a 2 per
cent discount on the first pay-
ment for the book. The E.C
voted 10-0 to give Calyx the
money. The payment will be for
1/3 the cost of the book, he said.
The book costs $17,000, he add-
ed.

Calyx’s request was for $800
more than last year. The $410
theft from the yearbook office
was partially responsible,
Leister said. Also, senior class
pictures will be more expensive
this year, he said. The pictures
will cost the Calyx $5 this year
as opposed to $2.25 last year.
Last year seniors were charged
$4.50; this year they have been
charged $6. _

Leister said this year’s year-
book will have about 25 more
pages and will include quite a
few color pictures.

RtP

The Ring-Tum Phi asked for
$3,000. Griffin noted that is
almost $1,000 less than the Phi
got last year. He said he assum-
ed increased advertising
revenue accounted for the dif-
ference.

Ariel

Ariel, W&L’s literary
magazine, requested $1,200 at
the hour and a half meeting.
Parker Potter, Ariel’s editor,
said he is planning to publish
two issues this year. He said the
two Ariels would be about 25
pages. Four hundred issues of
each Ariel would be printed, he
said. Each issue would cost $475
to print with only two colors, but

Potter said he wants to have the

capacity to print one of the
issues in full color. That issue
would cost an additional $200,
he said,

isa ana g$s3 32438583 80458 €82ET 394 4 9 Sretresvy tee ehtae i |

When asked why he thought
Ariel could publish two issues
this year when it could only get
out one last year, Potter said,
“It’s not terribly hard if we get
student contributions.” He said
last year’s situation was unique
in that the editor quit in the mid-
dle of the year, making the tran-
sition of power very difficult .
and making a Winter term edi-
tion an impossibility.

Others -

_ In two unanimous decisions
the E.C. gave the indoor soccer
club $100 to sponsor a Liberty
Hall Invitational Tournament
as well as to buy new uniforms
and goals, and decided to retain
Tom Spencer as the E.C.’s at-
torney for a fee of $200.

In all, the E.C. heard request
for $56,350. The E.C. has only

‘approximately $68,000, which

must last the entire year. Only
about $34,000 is available this
term. The E.C. had slightly
more to work with last year
thanks to an unusually large
freshman class.

The E.C. will decide on ap-
propriations at the next
meeting, Monday at 7 p.m. in
the Student Center.

Randy-Mac and Down the Road

It takes courage to get out of
bed with little sleep and a pain-
ful hangover, knowing that the
year’s first Economics test
awaits. The situation was not so
bleak last night when my
cronies informed me of a party
‘‘down the road.” Aware of my
priorities, it took 60 seconds of:
soul-searching to decide that
having attended class every
day was almost as good as stu-
dying. The only reason for
hesitation was that the party
was at the Pines at Randolph
Macon and Route 501 to Lynch-
burg is like picking your way
through a Pavillion party after
eight cups of grain.

For a road trip to be suc-
cessful, the proper supplies
must be procurred. Sufficient
quantities of cheap, but effi-
cient libation, and a modest
purchase from Super X Drugs
are advisable, if not vital. A fast
car with an 8track and an ex-
perienced guide who can
navigate the ;mountains at
outrageous speeds with no
hands are also necessary.
These qualifications met, our
expedition made its first stop at
the small Texaco station out-
side B.V.

“Is that bridge where we
were supposed to turn off?”

‘What? Oh..”

“Hey, you can’t back up on
this road.”’

“Watch me.”

A truck’s air horn sounded
and we all ducked, hoping the
beast wouldn’t see us. An
emergency roll right and we
came to a stop in a small field,
safe from danger as the red tail
lights disappeared over the
crest of the hill. A few precision
maneuvers later and we were
on the road again.

 

 

 

 

Correction

A story appearing in last
week’s Ring-tum Phi which said
that an SAE from Little Rock
was arrested for indecent ex-
posure was false. The Phi’s
staff wishes to apologize to the
person in question for any em-
barrassment the article may
have caused.

 

Opening the door released a

billow of smoke into the crisp
Lynchburg autumn air. Four of
us walked away from the car,
leaving two casualties slumber-
ing in the back - out for the
night. Three silhouetted figures
were discernible in the
distance; we looped toward
them, hopeful of begging in-
formation. ‘“‘Where...where..uh,
uh..where is, uh, Bell Dorm?
You know, the one with the din-
ing room in it.” Directions
freshly in mind, we made our
way to the building.

A rather obese, bovine look-
ing young maiden guarded the
entrance, exercising her only
option for the night: the study of
organic slime molds. The four
of us, ina dazed and bewildered
state, shuffled toward her con-
tenance. We stared at each
other, suppressing laughter,
while a brave member of our
party ventured a quarry.

“Uh, could you call Jamie
and tell her we’re here?”’

“Jamie who,”’ was the cold,
calloused reply.

“Oh, I don’t know. She lives
on the third floor. You know,
Jamie? She’s got blond hair
and big, uh, and she lives on the
third floor, I think.”

We never found Jamie, but no
matter, we pressed on to the
Pines.

There were many parties at
the infamous former sorority
houses that night, and finding
the right one was a chore that
taxed our combined resources
to the limit. The situation would
have been more easily handled
if we had been able to see, but
our tenacity of purpose prevail-

ed, and the proper party was
identified. Switching our
systems on overdrive, we
refueled on liquid courage, and
forged ahead into the unknown.

Courage reinstated, we divid-
ed forces and prepared for the
proverbial attack. Unfortunate-
ly for me, my intended victim
was better versed in the
rudiments of banal conversa-
tion than I, and my victory was
snatched by some _ upstart
freshman (just try to get a bid
now, buddy). There is only one
course of action in defeat and
that is to surrender to the God of
Human Waste Products and
join the ranks of the “wasted.”
With the background already
laid, this small task was easily
and quickly accomplished.

It has never ceased to amaze
me that Washington and Lee’s
fraternities persist in throwing
parties ‘down the road’’ for
girls who never attend.
Although perhaps a_ naive
assumption, one would think
that the girls might be so kind
as to grace our presence when
we bring the party to them. A
Sociology major should study
this phenomenon and publish
the results for the good of the
school.

And so the events leading to
my present dilemma have been
unraveled before your
disbelieving eyes. Yes, it takes
a lot of courage to take your
first Economics test of the year
with a hangover and four hours
of sleep - the kind of courage on-
ly the hard-core W&L student
possesses. But it is so much
easier to just roll over and bag
the test, and besides, I don’t feel
all that courageous anyway.

A couple of strolls to Lewis
Hall and a number of conversa-
tions with law students reveal
that Dan Beyer’s feelings
towards undergraduates are
not shared by his classmates.
At the same time, some
students felt that the Ring-tum
Phi did not help matters by
printing the cartoon next to the
letter.

 

Almost to a man, students
thought that the letter was
regretable. John Jessiee, a
second-year student, felt that
Beyer should not have made
statements like he did without
having adequate ground to base
them on. He remarked that he
has never had any problems
with undergraduates before and
feels there is no need to try to
cause friction between the two

groups.

Robert Wise agreed with
Jessiee. He felt that remarks

 

Republicans
hold picnic

by David Talley

Last Friday the College
Republicans held their annual
picnic in Woods Creek Meadow.
Membership chairman Mark
Mainwaring reports “‘the picnic
was a big success. There were
about 100 club members and 125
girls there.’’ The school’s
represented included Mary
Washington, Randolph-Macon,
Madison, Southern Seminary,
Longwood and Sweet Briar.

The club will now turn its at-
tention to the upcoming state
elections in November. ‘We
have already been working on
the campaign,” says Steve
Rodgers, campaign chairman,
“and we are in close contact
with the Dalton, Canada and
Coleman campaign camps. The
club will take its usual active
role in the area campaign ac-
tivities.”’ Rodgers stated that
the club has already completed
a campus voter canvass, and
conducted a bumper branding
with some Randolph-Macon
girls last Saturday in Lex-
ington. This Saturday bumper
branding is planned with
RMWC in Lynchburg, to be
followed by a touch football
game. |

| Law students
react to letter

‘Students do not feel that way J

 

like “‘Law students are definite-
ly a higher class of people”
were unfair, and that a law stu-
dent should be more careful
before making such statements.

Derek Swope, President of
the Third-Year Class and a
member of the Law School
Board of Governors, was also
concerned. He said, ‘‘Dan was
mad about his car but he did the
wrong thing. I don’t think he
was wise in what he said and he
didn’t speak for us all.”

On the other hand, Swope
said, “I do think the Ring-tum
Phi blew the letter out of pro-
portion by printing the cartoon
next to the letter. It was only
one person’s opinion and the
cartoon made it look like it was
the view of the whole law
school.

Mark Sharp, a second-year
student who graduated from
W&L, felt very much like
Swope. He thought the letter
was not good for relations bet-
ween the law school and
undergraduates, but he also felt
the Ring-tum Phi was _ir-
respossible in blowing it up the
way they did.

Sharp expressed a feeling
that seemed common around
Lewis Hall this week—that the
letter was only one person’s opi-
nion and that by the large, law

towards undergraduates.

In fact, a number of the law
students said they like
undergraduates. Four first-
year students who did their
undergraduate work at Virginia
said: “We are dependent on
them for our social lives. There
is nothing to do here.”’

 

A few said that the
undergraduates could cause
tensions at Lewis, particularly
when they use law student’s

If you have nothing to do this
weekend -- no date, no combo,
no booze, no Penthouse -- you
might consider blowing a cou-
ple of bucks at the State where
the Bad News Bears latest
nothing, ‘‘Breaking Training’’,
is playing.

You remember our darlings.
They could make you laugh say-
ing “go to h--,”” warm your
heart yelling ‘‘f--off,’’ and br-
ing tears to your eyes when they
suggested that “‘eat s---.”” They
played like the old Mets (in fact
the new Mets, too), and
miraculously won a champion-
ship.

Well, our loveable kids are
back.

And boring.

Walter Mathau is gone, and so
is Tatum O’Neal.

And so is the need for the Bad
News Bears.

The new stars are William
Devane and Clifton James, who
hardly fill their roles as pivotal
characters with the pizazz need-
ed to bring interest to the au-
dience’s state of mind.
Although, with all due fairness
to our stars, there wasn’t much

began operations on Monday,
has added a few new shows and
will operate on some slightly
different principles according
to new general manager Bob
DeMaria.

“This year all department
heads (News, Music, Program-
ming) will answer directly to
the student station manager,
who will answer to me,” said
DeMaria. This will put more
responsibility in the hands of
the students. DeMaria also said
he will expect student directors
to be more responsible over
themselves and other workers
on the station. ‘“This will enable
the station to be an entertaining
experience as well as a learning
one,”’ he said.

Student Directors for this
year are: Mike Lavitt, acting
station manager and program
director; Ed Burgess, news
director ; Steve Mattesky, assis-
tant news director, and public
affairs director; Bruce Wilmot,
sports director; and Les Gillen,
music director. Gillen’s
assistants are Mark Mainwar-

ing who is in charge of Third,

Ear, and Rob Tremblay, who
handles classics along with Ty
York. Tom Wornam will be jazz
director. Tom Tinsley is chief
engineer.

DeMaria said that as far as
programming goes, there will
be more bluegrass as well as a
little more classical and light
jazz. ‘‘Two new Sides”’ is back,
along with a new feature on 91.5
FM called ‘‘In Concert,”’ a show
which will feature live albums,
highlighted by interviews with
name rock groups hosted by
Mark Mainwaring.

Land o

in the script to help them bring
a greater interest in our heroes.

Our story is about the Bears’
(California State Little League
Champs) trek (in a stolen van)
to Houston where they are to
play a game against the Texas
L. L. champs in the Houston
Astrodome. (This ridiculous
idea was promoted by a Texan
beer tycoon.) The team,
through great effort, manages
to forget how to bat a ball, catch
a ball, and walk straight. They
pick up a kid who says he has a
delivery like Tom Seaver, that
turns out to be more like a milk
man’s. In addition, the team’s
star player looks up to his long
lost father (who, of course,
becomes the team’s coach), and
we are witnesses to the usual
trials and tribulations that oc-
cur before a father-son recon-
ciliation.

Well, our pitcher finally
learns how to pitch, and the
team remembers how to field,
and we are presented your
typical, suspense-filled come-
from-behind victory.

Wow.

The only feeling the viewer

WLUR, 91.5 on your dial, will
also carry home W&L Generals
football, basketball, and last
but not least, lacrosse games.
Doug Harwood’s ‘‘Anti-
headache machine” is back
along with another new addi-
tion, “Open Ear,” a show
featuring little known artists.
DeMaria also noted that a lot of
syndicated things from Na-
tional Public Radio, the

Longhorn Radio Network, and |!"

the Virginia Tech Radio Net-
work will be aired.

Both the New York Philhar-
monic, and the Metropolitan
Opera will be _ presented,
hopefully with better reception
this year, according to
DeMaria.

“‘We also hope to do a series ©

with Clark Mollenhoff in which
he discusses current issues and
events, a feature also to be car-
ried on Cable nine,’ said
DeMaria. Besides teaching at
W&L, Mollenhoff is a noted col-
umnist and observer of the
government scene, particularly
corrupt politicians and govern-
ment agencies.

DeMaria said he is looking for |
some business in the area to.
underwrite some special pro- '
gramming he has in mind. In |

addition DeMaria said, ‘‘We’re
looking forward to a tighter

and.professional sound that can |

be a credit to this school and the
community it serves.’’DeMaria
also emphasized that WLUR-
FM, 91.5, is an alternative
source of programming, and we
are not going to do what
everybody else does.”’

Oz

has when he leaves the theater
is that of being ripped-off.

With exception of two or three
fleetingly good moments, there
was nothing to get excited
about. The script was dull, and
all the old gags (especially the
mis-played ground balls) that
were so cute the first time
around got tiring after the first
5 seconds. Even the big climax
-- the game at the Astrodome --
wasn’t as suspenseful as it
should have been.

Actually, I wouldn’t go so far
as to say the “Bad News Bears
in Breaking Training’’ was bad.
Nor would I say that it was
anywhere near good.

It was.....nothing.

Usually not one to pick on
freshmen, I would like to thank
the animals of that breed for
making last Wednesday night’s
viewing at the Lyric a truly
nauseating experience for me
and all the other patrons pre-
sent.... Lynn Anderson is get-
ting a divorce, and nobody
cares.

Happy birthday,
HALE

ye and Ear:
from the Bookstore

by Betty Munger
The editorial in last week’s

students bursting with intellec-
tual enthusiasm and curiosity.
It seems that academic red tape
and Catch-22’s are preventing
these lively minds from exercis-
ing to full capacity.

Ten years ago, Washington
and Lee, foreseeing this un-
fortunate situation, established
the Bookstore to offer areas of
satisfaction for such intellec-
tual frustrations. Books: a wide
range of subjects ready to be
explored. No prerequisites (ex-
cept, of course, an interest in
reading) no distribution re-
quirements or linked courses,
etc.

Just think of the advantage of
books over professors. Books
are a pure distillation of all day-

after-day classroom lectures.
Books can be listened to at any
hour, day or night and are
highly portable. Books don’t get
colds with sneezings and

‘*coughings. One can stay in bed
. at 8:00 a.m. - with a book. Books

do not appear in an exhausted
condition after an all-nighter
with a new baby. One can look
ahead - even skip pages - in a
book; or flip backwards to
check on what happened
earlier. You can drop-ad a book
without slips or signatures.

Professors can seldom pour
out jewel-like phrases hour
after hour but books are bright
with them - nor, if I may be par-
doned the expression, can you
curl up with a professor.

And yet, and yet! Next week
we'll give equal time to the pro-
position that professors are bet-
ter than books.

successful solo careers as well
as first-chair positions with ma-
jor symphony and chamber or-
chestras. . . William McCorkle
and Walter Chestnut are
familiar to Lexington au-
diences. McCorkle will perform
the Poulenc Organ Concerto
and Chestnut will perform the
Haydn Trumpet Concerto.

The Theater Chamber
Players will perform music by
Bach, Boccherini, Webern and
Ligeti.

Richard Collins has perform-
ed extensively in Europe and
has appeared in concert on
television and radio in this
country. His program will con-
sist of works by Berg,
Schoenberg, Busoni and Ives.

Lewis Hall photographs as
“mildly mind-boggling . . . The

Forgey says her photos ‘‘are
like signposts, breath-taking
pauses between experiences
whose essential nature is inner
and abstract.”’

Generals Repeat
Losing Ways

by Pete Abitane

While it looked for quite
awhile that the Generals would
enjoy for the first time this
season the thrill of victory, it
somehow slipped from their
grasp and turned into the ugly
agony of defeat. In a game that
saw the W&L defense play the
best it has all year, the offense
coughed up the ball on six occa-
sions. The crowd stood up and
cheered for the first time since
lacrosse season, and a bizarre
play that has become a General
trademark, also saw a
mediocre Centre College team
come out on top Saturday, 14-13.

After a scoreless first
quarter, Centre began a drive
that culminated in a play wor-
thy of the ‘Most incredible play
of the year’ award. Blessed with
good field position at the W&L
35, Centre mounted their at-
tack. With second and eight,
quarterback Rick Riney com-
pleted a pass to wing-back Mike
Gosset who made a nifty run of
eighteen yards but fumbled on
the Generals’ fifteen yard line.
At least three W&L defenders
missed an opportunity to be the
hero and Centre split end Mike
Clontz fell on the loose ball in
the end zone for an easy six
points. Curt Grider kicked the
PAT and Centre went into the
locker room with a 7-0 lead.

But transformations often
happen in locker rooms, and the
Generals came out to play their
most inspiring defense of the

year. A jarring tackle by Carl
Folcik on the Colonels first of-
fensive play of the second half
ignited one of the most intense
flows of emotion ever witnessed
on Wilson Field. With W&L
manhandling the offense and
controlling the momentum,
they were well on their way toa
thirteen point third quarter.

The Generals capped their
first scoring drive of the day on
the running of freshman Karl
Cheatham. Scampering around
right end, he cut back against
the grain and galloped to a 65
yard touchdown. That play in-
cidentally, was the longest
since Randy Broyles ran 77
yards for a TD vs. Virginia in
1951. In addition, Cheatham’s
132 yards on 18 carries for a
single game rushing total is se-
cond only to Tom Van Am-
burgh’s 172 yards which
ironically also came at the
hands of Centre. Danny Thomp-
son provided the extra point and
tied game at 7-7.

The Generals continued to ap-
ply the pressure. After a 47 yard
field goal attempt by Thompson
went wide left, Kevin McGowan
intercepted a Riney pass and
returned it 25 yards to the Cen-
tre 10. Hissey picked up 6 yards
on an option right and one play
later Cheatham once again
went over for the score, this
time on a sweep left. However,
what turned out to be the
crucial PAT went wide.

W&L Harriers
Fall Short

by Chris Clements

Washington and Lee opened
its 1977 Cross Country season
here Saturday defeating three
of its four opponents in the four-
way meet. Davis and Elkins
paced by Mike Redman, who
placed first, managed to hang
on to the overall victory with a
score of 33 points. W&L with 38
points was second. Shepherd
College was a distant third with
66 points followed by Liberty
Baptist with 99, and West
Virginia Tech with Il0 points.

Bob Bates was the first
General to finish. He placed se-
cond overall. Following Bates
were Richard Bird in fourth,
Allen Weeks sixth, Chris Daniel
eight, and Brian Adams,
Washington and Lee’s fifth
man, placing I8th overall.

Washington and Lee had an
opportunity to sweep the
quadangular meet if Hans
Furuland had not been forced to
drop out of the race some 300

yards from the finish line.
Furuland, a native of Sweden,
was unaccustomed to the heat
and collapsed rounding the first
turn of the final 440 yards.
Furuland was rushed to the
hospital, treated for heat ex-
haustion, and discharged from
the hospital that evening. He
would have placed tenth, had he
been able to finish the race at a
jog, giving the Generals the
overall victory in the meet.

Bob Bates pointed out that
almost everyone was affected
by the heat. He said, when you
run in the afternoon in the heat
it usually shaves a minute off
your time. Bates personally
doesn’t mind running in the
heat. He also points out that
everyone has to adjust to the
heat, and that it’s a great feel-
ing to finish the race before
cheering fans at a football
game. The best time to run a
cross-country meet is around 10
o'clock in the morning.

Generals soaked
in opener

Varsity water polo, W&L’s
newest of thirteen inter-
collegiate sports opened the
season last weekend competing
in a Southern League Tourna-
ment at the University of Rich-
mond.

Coach Bill Stearns called the
tourney a good opportunity to
see just how W&L’s young team
would do against top flight com-
petition. The polo Generals first
game was against very for-
midable East Carolina, and
they came out on the short end
of a 24-8 final score. W&L used
various combinations on of-
fense and defense, and ex-
pecially in goal where Bill
Meyer is out witha injury.

The Generals lost their se-
cond game to the University of

Richmond’s ‘A’ team, the
defending state champion, 8-5,
but showed signs of improve-
ment. That improvement was
very evident in the team’s third
game of the tournament against
the U of R’s “B” team, the
same team that finished third in
last year’s state championships
behind the Richmond ‘‘A”’ team
and ‘W&L. The Generals won
their first intercollegiate con-
test 15-6.

Freshman Will Hodges ap-
pears to have won the first team
goalie position as he came in
very well in the final two
games. Scott Duff and Biff Mar-
tin did well on offense for W&L,
while Drew Pillsbury, Chip
Hoke, and transfer Mike Foley

WIN

his superb ball-handling, dribbl-
ed past the Radford fullback on
the right wing. He shot the ball
towards the left side of the net
past the goalie. Stone, in an in-
surance move typical of a winn-
ing soccer team, poked the ball
in.

After the first goal the Rad-
ford team came out snarling.
But the Generals defense,
which was later refered to as
tenacious, solid, and _ stingy,
stopped them. Radford tried to
beat the fullbacks by playing

longball. They would chip the .

ball over the Generals’ heads
and try winning the ensuing
race towards the goal. The
W&L fullbacks would either
out-muscle them, or Kevin
Carney or Mark Bennett, who
shared the goal-tending, would
stop the shot.

In the second half the
Generals continued to control
the game. While Radford was
tired out by its all-out effort in
the first half, the W&L team
was able to out-hustle the op-
position. Practicing the team ef-
fort Coach Piranian refers to,
the Generals played a
deliberate passing game.

Their cooperation was
rewarded about 20 minutes into
the second half. Dave Williams
scored off a chip-shot by Collier.
Dave Samuelson scouped up a
loose ball on the left side of the
opponents’ goal. He passed it
along the front of the goal. Col-
lier received the ball on the
right side and kicked it into the
air. Williams headed the ball in.
Williams also scored the winn-
ing goal against Virginia
Wesleyan a week before on a
head ball.

Coach Piranian feels he has
solved the major problems of
the team. And it appears he
has; eight goals in three games,
the defense has yet to be scored
on, and the team. already has
three wins. Piranian’s pre-
season goals; are ac-
complishable by this team. The
goals were; score more than 13
goals, allow less than 37 goals,
and win more than three
games. However, the toughest
competition is still ahead.

Losing ways

continued from page 6

At this point it looked as
though the Generals were going
to run Centre right back to Dan-
ville, Ky. But at this point W&L
did not resemble the con-
fident team of a year ago that
won four of its last five games.
Hissey and Cheatham both
received shoulder injuries on
the touchdown drive and with
their departure so went the
Generals’ momentum.

Centre took the opening
fourth quarter kickoff and mar-
ched 52 yards in ten plays with
freshman runningback Stan
Tracht taking it in from three
yards out. Grider provided the
extra point and lead 14-13.

With eight minutes remaining
and the good fortune of a poor
Centre punt, W&L had the ball
on the Colonels 26 first and ten.
However, a costly fumble, one
of six on the day, destroyed the
chance of an almost certain
field goal.

After a tough defensive stand,
W&L once again had the ball,
this time on their own 29. Witha
combination of freshmen Chris
Leiser and Scott Swope repilac-
ing Hissey at quarterback, the
Generals failed to utilize their
remaining time-outs and thus
ran out of time—The generals
had agonizing losers 14-13.

The average reader might be
inclined to think that the
Generals should have won their
third game of the year, and they
well should have. But the fact
remains that any team which
commits eight turnovers, (six
fumbles and two interceptions)
would not stand much of a
chance with even Lexington
High. Why with only fifty
seconds left in the half and the
ball on their own twenty did the
Generals choose to run out the
clock instead of time-outs and
sideline passes to move at least
within field goal range? Why
with a minute and a half left in
the game did they choose to
keep the ball on the ground and
once again disregard their
quota of time-outs?

It is not the intent of this col-
umn to offer answers to these
questions, nor pass judgement
on players and coaches.
However, it is well within the
prerogative of this article to
make the following observation.

Washington and Lee has
assembled this year the finest

football personnel since the
glory days of the early sixties. A
very talented group on paper, it
is now time to shun the large
egos and high esteem that have
been created by such com-
ments. It is time to go out on
Saturday and beat the living
daylights out of someone! It is
high time that this gifted group
of athletes reject and cancel
memories as well as
forethoughts of the agony of
defeat and begin revelling and
anticipating the thrill of vic-
tory! Only then will the
monotonous practices seem
worth it and the foresight of
others be confirmed that this is
indeed a fine football team.

Loss of key players
won't hurt tennis team

by Jim Barnes
In the midst of the departure
of Dee Keesler and Richard
Makepeace, last year’s number
four and five singles players
respectively, Coach Dennis
Bussard predicts a_ losing
season for his team which tied
for second in the Division III
playoffs last May. Bussard
said, “I don’t expect a winning
season, and I don’t really care.”’
The only courts Keesler and
Makepeace will be playing on
this spring are the slow red clay
courts in Germany and
Spain as they are spending
the academic spring semester
abroad. Both were given the op-
portunity to participate on this
year’s fall team, and in the spr-
ing up to the time they left. To
their credit they voluntarily
declined to go out for the team.
They did not want to keep a
space on the team and the
valuable match experience that
goes with it from another player
who'd be holding down that spot
come April and May, when the
bulk of the team matches are
played.

year’s second place team in its

division would be ebullient over
the prospects for this year’s
team. Not Bussard. Why?
Coach Bussard is quick to point
out the kind of teams that are on
this year’s schedule. There are
19 Division I teams on this
year’s schedule, along with five
Division II or III teams that
were involved in post season
play last year.

Bussard believes that by
playing tough teams during the
regular season the players will
be better prepared for the
playoffs, from whence national
recognition derives. His theory
has some merit as evidenced by
the General’s results last year.
The Generals had a mediocre
14-13 regular season record, but
went on to tie for second place
in the Division III playoffs last
May. ‘‘Anyway,’’ Bussard says,
“tennis isn’t a team sport. It’s
an individual sport. I don’t like
team records. The whole thing
is competition, good competi-
tion for the national champion-
ships.”’

When asked how the absence

would affect the team’s showing
this year Bussard responded,
“They'll definitely be missed
during the regular season, but
in the playoffs, I don’t know.”’
One should keep in mind that of
the 12 points that W&L
garnered in the playoffs, All-
Americans Ben Johns and
Stewart Jackson won nine of the
General’s 12 points. A point total
of nine would have W&L tied
for third in last year’s playoffs.

A good recruiting year for the
team is another reason for op-
timism in this year’s post
season play. Among this year’s
crop of newcomers is freshman
Cody Davis. Davis was a high
school All American, and one of
the top Florida juniors. He is
currently playing number three
singles on the fall tennis team.
Bussard thinks that this young
man ‘‘could be just as good as
last year’s number three
player, Ken Voelker, if not bet-
ter by the time of the playoffs
beginning at Ohio Wesleyan on
May 17-20.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

It seems as though Dan Scott has hit upon a solution for many of
our entertainment woes here at W&L: Take some of the entertain-
ment scheduling power the SAB now has and give it to people more
knowledgeable about music and perhaps more capable of con-
sistently booking good acts into the Cockpit. From the last time that
Lee fed Traveler a sugar cube to the present, the SAB has had a vir-
tual monopoly over how we are entertained, and who entertains us.
It should be evident to all that satisfaction does not run rampant.

We question the rationale behind continually booking soul acts
for a student body which consistently states a ‘‘rock’’ preference
from year to year in the SAB entertainment survey. It can be
argued that a washed out ‘‘name” soul band was booked for
homecoming because of the traditional 40 kegs of beer, and for
economy reasons. But this year when it was discovered that
homecoming was to be dry, no attempt was made to get a higher
quality act. The reason now becomes the importance of having a
name band that is recognizable to the student body, and since
‘‘name’”’ rock bands are so expensive, AB&D was signed.

The problem for us with this is that we can’t really appreciate a
group of old men from Houston, Texas. I point out more pro-
gressive homecomings of the past. In the early 70’s, the Allman
Brothers Band, J. Geils Band, and the Ear] Scruggs Revue played
at homecoming dances. Granted, W&L did get them on their way
up to the top and at the time they were unknown, but they are ob-
viously not soul bands. It seems strange that we could get quality
entertainment back then, but find it so difficult to do now,

So we say, ‘‘Give Dan Scott’s PM club the money to get started.”
It doesn’t have to be $33,000. They probably would not ask for that
amount anyway. After they got on their feet, the program would
probably support itself. And in the process, please and entertain
plenty of people. If it did succeed in bringing top quality acts to
campus, it would almost surely put pressure on the SAB to compete
with the PMC and force the SAB to consistently seek out and pro-
vide top quality entertainment for the W&L community,

Tradition continues to remain an important aspect of this fine old
institution. A prime example of this is the football team’s tradition
of losing. The student body has come to expect a nonwinning
season. From the football team and from the team’s showing in the
first three games, it looks like we won't be disappointed.

The team has not really looked bad. In fact, the offense has im-
proved since last year, and the defense has been steadily improving
this year. Against Lock Haven State, no matter how corny it
sounds, it seemed as if the time really did run out on the Generals.
We were definitely outclassed against Davidson, to the point that
they should never have been scheduled. Though these two games
were host, we really can’t feel too upset about them.. The team
played as well as could be expected under the circumstances.

What we can be upset about is the loss of the last game to Centre
College. The Generals played well for most of the game; perhaps
the best they have played all year, Then finding themselves behind
by one point with three minutes to go, they gave the game away
under the direction of the coaching staff. Why the coaches elected
to put in a freshman quarterback to run the option play when the
outcome of the game was still undecided is a perturbing question.

No matter how good a runner Leiser is, and this is not to take
anything away from him, a freshman backup QB whose only play-
ing experience this year has been as a running back, should not
have been given the job of directing the offense at such a crucial
time. There is just too much pressure in a situation like that to put
upon his shoulders, But even more importantly, a passing strategy
was called for, and our team sources have said that Leiser is just
not competent in this area.

The second string QB Scott Swope is supposed to be a competent
passer. Swope is a junior, who, if not anything else, has two more
years of maturity than a freshman. Granted, Swope does not have
much play time experience (and we question this due to'this year’s
record), but he is a passer and a passer was needed in this par-
ticular situation, We are not suggesting that the game would
definitely have been won had Swope been put in immediately after
Hissey’s injury, but our chances almost undoubedly would have
been increased. The coaches did put Swope in to do what Leiser
couldn’t, but there were only 29 seconds left on the clock.

This indecision and misdecision is reminiscent of the 1975 Centre
College game when after being behind 9-3, the Generals scored with
seconds remaining on the clock, and the coaches elected to try out
their two point conversion play instead of going for the almost sure
win by kicking the extra point, Another case is last year at
Hampden-Sydney when coaching indecision concerning what was
going. on on the field when a field goal was obviously called for and
the coaches’s lack of concentration led to a delay of game penalty,
which resulted in a short field goal attempt.

The coaching staff has been out to lunch. There is no coordination
and communication between the coaches. Indecision is com-
monplace, not rare, It appears that the team has no coaching
leadership, as evidenced by the above games which resulted in not-
ches for the lost column. The head coach is supposed to make the
important decisions when they need to be made, not just concern
himself with the defensive backfield. Coach McHenry, where are
you when you are needed?

The team has the potential to have a winning season this year.
But we wonder whether tradition will be broken unless some
leadership decisions or changes are made. JIM.

Dear Editor:

I wish to clarify the article
concerning the Student Ac-
tivities Board (SAB) which ap-
peared in the Ring-tum Phi on
16 September 1977. I provided
information addressing three
issues: a loan to a student for
personal use, SAB security of
gate receipts, and SAB accoun-
ting practices.

Information came to me last
May that irregularities existed
in the handling of SAB money. I
spoke with several members of
the Board and then asked for all
Board records. I was told that
receipts for all expenditures

‘had been removed from the
SAB office and destroyed. I was
then given all disbursement
vouchers and the Board’s ac-
count book.

I discovered a disbursement
voucher signed by John Berley,
dated 9 March 1977, authorizing
a check payable to Charlie
Hulfish, The voucher stated
that the money was a loan for
housing and was to be repaid in
two weeks. I considered this

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry

personal loan a gross abuse ot
discretion and trust by the in-
dividuals and felt a duty to
disclose this information. The
loan has since been repaid with
interest,

I was told by SAB members
that monies received at Board
events were often stored in the
SAB office overnight; at times,
sizeable sums were left there.
Board members told me that
money disappeared on different
occasions and that losses caus-
ed the Board to store the money
elsewhere. These were the
reports of stealing mentioned in
the article. I did not state that
Board members took money.
The evidence is that money was
placed in the office, and some of
it was gone at next counting.
The EC has now required the
SAB to make night deposits at a
local bank of all money taken in
at Board events.

The Board kept disbursement
vouchers and receipts for all ex-
penditures and maintained an
accounting. The practice of the
SAB was to throw out old

 

receipts at the end of the year
because they take up space. The
practice, apparently accepted
in the past by the EC and the
SAB, frustrates substantiation
of expenditures. For example,
checks were drawn to Messrs.
Armstrong and Berley, as
reported, and to other students
for what I believe were SAB
purposes, The problem created
by the absence of receipts,
however, is that many of the ex-
penditures cannot be verified.
The EC has therefore required
all student organizations to re-
tain receipts for all expen-
ditures.

A side point: the article
stated that I said SAB members
had private parties at the stu-
dent fund’s expense. This was a
statement by my source, a
member of the SAB, and has not
been substantiated by concrete
evidence at this:time. To my
knowledge, Messrs. Armstrong
and Berley carried out their
duties as SAB co-chairmen with
honesty. I trust that this ac-
count has clarified the matter.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Editor:

I feel that it is necessary that
I state my opinion in reference
to the letter of Mr. Daniel G.
Beyer, of the School of Law.
What he has done is to impugn
the honor of the entire
undergraduate student body.

He is an intermediate law stu-
dent, who still has not . learned
the first rule of law; that a per-
son is presumed innocent until
proven guilty. Yet he, through
what must be considered omnis-
cient knowledge, has found the
whole of the undergraduate
classes guilty. The verdict of
guilty is unfounded because it is
supported by no evidence what-
soever, bar that of the bigoted
opinion on his part toward any
student who is not in the Law
School. His statement, and I
quote, ‘‘One of my classmates
would have told me, but not an
undergraduate,”’ not only pro-
ves the stupidity of Mr. Beyer,
but also that he is uninformed
as to the caliber of the student
body.

When Mr. Beyer, starts his
condemnation of the Honor
System, he demonstrates that it
is not the undergraduates who
do not abide by it. He finds fault
with the Honor System in
reference to the
undergraduates; I find fault
with him. He says he never
worked under an Honor System
and that fact is evident, because
no gentleman would ever make
such totally unfounded allega-
tions. He is no gentleman.

If Mr. Beyer is representative
of the Law School, then I am
glad to be an undergraduate. If
he is not, then the Law School
has my deepest sympathies for
having to count him as one of
their number, |

Sincerely,
Joseph D. Sloboda ‘81

Dear Mr. Beyer,

After reading your letter I
could not help:but be astounded
and amazed) at what you
‘higher types’ use for thinking.
It seemed to’ me most signifi-
cant that your letter of accusa-
tion without proof whould ap-
pear in the same issue that the
facts of the “‘unrepayed loan’”’
incident with Mr. Hulfish
become public. Your letter is
but another accusation in lieu of
fact. This is against the
American way, and against the
American legal process as set
forth in the U.S. Constitution,
the understanding of which is
why you are at Law School. So
what are you doing over there?
First Mr. Goddard, and then
you start throwing around un-
proved accusations. Guilty until
proven innocent is a standard
policy of Soviet Russia and
other police states, which this is
not! In fact, in America, these

type of accusations get lawyers —

in big trouble every year, so I

advise some discretion in your

snap judgements. I leave you

with one thought, oh wise

one...Who would steal a law
book but a law student?

Constitutionally,

Reynolds ‘‘Ace’’ Dobs ‘78

P.S. Was your car parked il-
legally? Sounds like it.

Dear Editor,

In response to Mr. Dan
Beyer’s comments in the last
issue:

What a crock of manure! I’ve
seen better reasoned and more
mature writings on bathroom
stalls. Mr. Beyer’s letter makes
two basic claims. The first is
that law students are more
honest than the undergrads.
The second is that they are,
somehow, more mature. The
letter only disapproves both of
these assertions. It is not honest
to indict all W&L undergrads
for damage to his car, nor is it
the product of a seasoned
thought process. It is, to coin a
phrase, all sound and fury, and
as such cannot signify law
school opinion.

As a first-year law student, I

am not so far removed from my

humble origins as Mr. Beyer’s
letter might suggest he is. I
wish to apologize for the bom-
bastic outburst printed last
week. It is an apology based on
a desire to communicate. It is
not based on embarrassment,
for it could only embarrass if it
were an accurate picture of law
school opinion.

It is to be hoped that this sort
of condescending puffery will
not recur. It serves no purpose.
Worse, it feeds a prejudice
which can only exist in an ig-
norant host organism.

John Fraser

Editor, Ring-tum Phi

This letter is in response to
that of Daniel G. Beyer, ‘79L. I,
too, write with deep regret.

The injury to his car, I do not
doubt, was extensive, and the
failure to as much as apologize
and offer to make restitution is
reprehensible.

However, what makes Mr.
Beyer so certain that an
undergraduate was to blame?
While I would not even want to
try to say that every
undergraduate at Washington
and Lee is as pure as the driven
snow, neither do I believe that
every student in the School of
Law is “simply of a higher
caliber.”’

Perhaps one of his classmates
hit Mr. Beyer’s car, but suppos-
ing that it was the property of
an undergraduate said student
felt an apology or restitution to
a sppiled rich brat of a lower
caliber would not be in order. I

can almost imagine such a

thought going through Mr.
Beyer’s mind if he were to hit

an undergraduate’s car.

As to the party last year, in
which a student was ‘sauteed
by his ‘gentleman’ friends,”’ I
agree with Mr. Beyer. Such ac-
tion is unpardonable in a
“gentleman’s school.”’ RtP
letter-add one

It is easy to see the bad side of
anything, and Mr. Beyer has
selected a good example of it.
But not all of us are like that.

So, my final observation to
Mr. Beyer is this. There are
jerks on both sides of the fence.
Try to pick and choose, because
not all of us on this side of the
creek would act as you have
depicted us, and perhaps some
of the people on your side of the
eek would.

Sincerely,
Douglass W. Dewing, ‘77

Dear Editor,

It is with great glee that I feel
the need to write this letter.
How often does anyone, much
less a law student (i.e. higher
caliber ego) leave himself ab-
solutely naked to the scorching
pens of (we. inferior
undergrads? My answer is not
very often, so thank you, Daniel
G. Beyer, yet to attain es-
quireship.

Beyer’s letter in last weeks
Phi was something I thought no
future lawyer could write.
Never let it be said that a mere
“boy who will be a_ boy”
reminded him that our legal
framework is based on a simple
idea: the undergraduate body
at W&L is innocent until proven
guilty. I suggest Beyer contact
his insurance company and stop
hurling blanket insults at the
honor code, the E.C., and all

' undergrads. Need I remind him

that there are many more of us
than him.

Now let it not be said that I
am making light of his misfor-
tune (the accident), or his mis-
judgement (writing the letter).
I seriously grieve his inconve-
nience. In the last few years he
and his fellow law students,
especially on the E.C.,.have
become more involved in
general campus life. Some
might not like this trend. I
myself point to the fact that we
have built them a brand new
law school, isolated from the
rest of the campus, and that this
is assuredly where he and the
capable women in the law
school belong.

Lastly I would like to point out
that his Zeus caliber cronies
make up a sizable percentage of
those living in Woods Creek.
The road in front of Woods
Creek is used primarily by law
students going to and from their
Olympus. Maybe one of them
had a little too much ambrosia
that Saturday night. Even the
real gods of the real Olympus
were known to imbibe in excess
occasionally. The cocktail party
the Dean of the Law School
gave that Saturday night must

Tothe editor:

While’ Mr. Beyer’s_ un-
fortunate letter comes close to
making an ass of the rest of us
at the law school, it unques-
tionably makes a total ass of
him.

First: Mr. Beyer implies that
he knows certain offences com-
mitted against him were the
acts of undergraduates. But
how does Mr. Beyer know this?
He offers not a _ shred of
evidence to back his inference.
And, as every entering law stu-
dent quickly learns, drawing
conclusions without presenta-
tion of supporting facts is sim-
ple supposition.

Second: Mr. Beyer boldly
declares law students “are
simply a higher class of peo-
ple,” leaving the negative im-
plication from the context that
undergraduates constitute
W&L’s low class. But, as Mr.
Beyer will learn as he delves
deeper into his study of law,

generalizations are fraught
with possibilities of unfairness.
While Mr. Beyer professes to
reject the values of what he
terms a “‘southern gentlemen’s
school,”’ it is nonetheless un-
fortunate that his remarks
reveal all the certain earmarks

of bigotry.

The irony of Mr. Beyer’s let-
ter is perhaps that instead of
showing the superiority of the
mind of a law student he shows
only how little he himself has
absorbed of the law’s teaching.

Sincerely,
Robert Wise, Law II football

To the editor:

I would like to take this op-
portunity to address our grad
from Whatsamatta U. who is
now attending our law school. It
seems our boy, Danny, was
foolish enough to park his car in
a dangerous area on the road-
way which services the Woods
Creek Apartments.

Notwithstanding the fact that
no ten-year old cerebral palsy
victim would even consider
parking a tricycle at that spot,
Danny was “‘disgusted’’ to find
his left quarter panel bashed in.
Since it couldn’t have been a
citizen of Lexington, nor a con-
struction worker, and by no
means -- God forbid -- a law stu-
dent, our boy decided that it
was a typical violation of the
honor code (no note being at-
tached to the mangled car) as
committed by a W&L
undergrad.

Young Daniel also informed
us, through his literal work of
art, that an _ undergrad
(unknown to him, God, or
anyone else, for that matter)
has previously relieved him of a
law book and valuables such as
two empty stereo speaker
boxes.

Now, grant you, the Honor
Code is not in the healthiest of
conditions, and I at times have
been disappointed at the occa-
sional break-down of moral
fibre in our student body, but I
think it might be time that this
shlepp of an excuse for a law
student learn the major princi-
ple of our judicial system. That
being the accused is ‘innocent
until proven guilty.”’

It is hard for me to imagine
any undergrad stealing a law
book, except, maybe, to use as a
doormat. I can’t say I’d blame.
anyone -- janitor, undergrad,
mutt -- for throwing away a pair
of empty speaker boxes that
were probably blocking a
hallway, although I would
highly consider sending anyone
who would consider this an
outrageous honor violation to
Dr. Worth for an emergency ex-
amination. Moreover, I’d think
before I accused anyone --
group or individual -- of a crime
as serious as the one that oc-
curred in this case.

The only group I can blame
for this incident is the law
school. However, I will say no
more. After all, it is the law
school administrators, faculty
and students who must
(hopefully) bear the embar-
rassment of the fact that this

-moron was admitted in the first

place.

nament, to be played this
weekend at ODU in Virginia
Beach. Last weekend the
Generals played in the Navy In-
vitational Tournament .at An-
napolis. Johns and Jackson both
reached the semi-finals of their
respective brackets. The team
as a whole finished fourth out of
five teams competing. Navy
finished first followed by W&M,
MD, W&L, and Swarthmore.

Bussard is not enthusiastic
over the idea of fall tennis.
“Tennis is a year-round sport
these days,’ says Bussard.
‘“‘You’re forced to keep up if you
want to have a good team.”
Bussard is particularly critical
of holding the state champion-
ship tournament in the fall.
Bussard said the tournament
should be held the first week of
May when the players are at the
peak of their game. One thing is
certain though of the fall season
for the Generals. Having played
Maryland twice, Virginia twice,
Navy, Ohio University, and last
year’s Division II] champs
Swarthmore, to name a few;
the Generals will be used to
playing tough teams.

Violations

depend on the outcome of
Wednesday’s Student Affairs
Committee meeting.

When asked about the severi-
ty of fines for major violations,
Judiciary Board Member Steve
Jones commented, ‘Things
have been lax for so long, that
we decided to tighten up before
violations get out of hand. If the
frats cooperate, then maybe we
can slack up later (on the
severity of fines).”’

One interesting note is the
lack of ‘‘contact” or what is
commonly called ‘‘dirty rush”
violations. This is not to say that
there have not been any com-
mitted, but thus far no fines
have been levied for such of-
fenses. In comparison, last year
there were over $300 in contact
violation fines. This would tend
to support the IFC position that
the implementing of stiff fines
the first time discourages fur-
ther infractions.

Computer crime: What’s the answer

by Neil Cote

James Madison University
was named the winner in the
varsity division during a series
of debates held on _ the
Washington and Lee campus
last weekend. Bridgewater Col-
lege finished first in the novice
division. Twelve colleges, from
Virginia and _ surrounding
States, completed in the events.
W&L was merely the host,
since its debate team has not
yet been organized.

The topic of the weekend’s
debates concerned methods of
combating white collar crime,
mainly the widespread practice
of unscrupulous use of com-

puters in order to reap profits il-

legally.

Madison University and
William & Mary College,
by virtue of victories
in the opening rounds,
competed in the varsity finals.
Madison’s two contestants,
Mark Reissinger and William
Mitchell, played the affirmative
role during the final. debate.
Basing their argpments that
present day methods of ap-
prehending white collar
criminals are both inadequate
and impractical, they ad-
vocated the ,use of new
technology, including the use of
legal tapping devices in order to
gain the evidence necessary to
arrest people involved in
fraudulent practices.

Donald Henderson and Nancy
Short, both from W&M, oppos-
ed the stand taken by Madison.

They criticized the use of ultra-
modern technology as being in
league with George Orwell’s
“Big Brother’’ and ‘‘a complete
invasion of privacy.’’ Hender-

Man’s best friends.

son and Miss Short suggested
that special schools could be
started and funded by the
LEAA which could teach police
and law enforcers how to detect
computer related crimes
without having to resort to the
use of new equipment which
‘would endanger the concept of
democracy as we now know it.”’

Each of the four debaters was
allowed ten minutes to deliver
his opening speech. After the in-
itial speeches, five minutes at
the podium was given to each
debater so he could defend his
previous statements. Miss
Short was the first one to speak
and she again pointed out the
practicality of ‘‘police schools”

 

‘*...eriticized the use of
ultramodern technology as be-
ing in league with ‘George
Orwell's Big Brother...”

 

as a possible deterent to com-
puter crimes. ‘The LEAA
spends $40 million annually for
criminal investigations,’’ she
said. ‘‘Certainly they would be
willing to fund schools where
police could learn means of
detecting white collar
criminals.”

Reissinger was next on the
stand and he retorted that the
LEAA has done very little in ac-
tually decreasing corruption in
big businesses and unless new
technology was put to use for
crime detection, law enforcers
would not be able to accumulate

thé necessary evidence to pro-
secute white collar criminals.

Henderson and Mitchell then
took their turns speaking, both
of them echoing their respec-
tive teammates’ views. Hender-
son backed up Miss Short on her
suggestion of ‘‘special police
schools’ and Mitchell stated
perhaps the best argument
against W&M’s stand. He
declared, ‘Unless we have in-
vestigative technology superior
to the computer practices
employed by businessmen, we
will be helpless in impeding the
growth of fraudulant use of
computers.”

The results of the debates
were announced in Payne Hall
by Halford Ryan, Professor of
English at W&L. In the novice
division, Bridgewater narrowly
outpointed Alderson Rod and
Old Dominion. VMI and the
West Virginia University round-
ed off the top five.

As expected, Madison was
declared the winner in the var-
sity division as the team of Mit-
chell and Reissinger edged
W&M’s Henderson and Short.
The U.S. Naval Academy finish-
ed a close third, followed by Old
Dominion and the Madison ‘‘A”’
team. Mitchell was named the
tournament’s top speaker.

The W&L debate team has a
full schedule facing them in the
next month. Professor Ryan
and the team have events plan-
ned at Johns Hopkins Universi-
ty in Baltimore during the latter
part of the month as well as
dates with Wake Forest,
Madison, William and Mary,
and Pennsylvania. Also
scheduled is a debate with Ox-
ford University at Moots Hall in
the W&L Law School. The topic
will concern the use of cen-
sorship in order to control por-
nography.

Washington and Lee Debates

Long live the King

by Ned McDonnell

Edinburgh University of
Scotland has a_ widespread
reputation for producing fine
debaters. Last Monday, Tony
Fekete and Chris Wyke,
representing this British in-
stitution, upheld that the United
States needs a monarchy.
Valiantly arguing the case for
the status-quo were Steve
Bigler and Joe Baker of
Washington and Lee. Although
the W&L duo had an extensive
arsenal of facts and figures,
they met their demise through a
difference in speaking styles.

Capitalizing on experience of
debating this topic and on dif-
ferent types of humor, the
British pair somehow managed
to put everybody, including the
audience, on the defensive.
Baker, on the other hand,
debating publicly for the first
time, showed his nervousness
thus negating some strong
arguments. By cracking one
liners on everything from
Roman Polanski to Air Force
One, by judiciously exercising
sarcasm in reference to their
opponents, by unleashing their
mordent wits on the W&L
arguments, by deftly using
“show and tell’’ techniques
such as_ presenting Silver
Jubilee T-shirts to their adver-
saries, and by using countless
other facial and verbal expres-
sions to generally win the
hearts of the audience, Fekete
and Wyke, dealing with an
untenable thesis, managed
brilliantly to divert the
onlookers’ attention from the

‘debate topic and, more im-

portantly, from the slew anti-
monarchy empiricisms
presented by Baker and Bigler.
Interspersed among the jokes,
Fekete and Eyke sustained an
argument that America needs a
monarch to unify the people and

to give people faith in their in-
stitutions through psychological
indentification with a
depoliticized cultural symbol.

Baker and Bigler countered
by saying, among other things,
that America has a _ strong
historical aversion to a
monarch, that the U.S. is too
diverse to accept a monarch
gracefully, and that a new
monarchy would bring no func-
tional or psychological ad-
vantages while imposing fiscal
strains on the federal govern-
ment.

But the yanks, gaining self
assurance toward the end of the
evening and just beginning to
pick up some of the polish of
their rivals, could not handle
the redcoats’ final ploy. Bri-
tain’s finest hour came, when,
unable to answer to Bigler’s
final arguments, Chris Wyke
frankly told the audieunce that
they were being ‘‘duped’’ by
their compatriots. This crafty
maneuver put the audience on
the intellectual defensive. If the
spectator voted with the anti-
monarchists, that person would
be among the masses of the
gullible.

Thirty votes were tallied.
FINAL SCORE: Edinburgh 20,
Washington and Lee 10. Fekete
and Wyke proved that debating,
as an art of persuasion, involves
not only facts and figures but
charisma, humour, and elo-
quence.

On the lighter side, after all
the haranguing and knit-picking
had ended, the two Britons,
(who have above average im-
itations of “Big Jimmy’’),
relaxed over beers in the
Cockpit and admitted that as
members of the Conservative
Union, they sat in back rooms,
got drunk, and sang Con-
federate fight songs. The two
elaborated further on the sub-
ject by noting that an occa-
sional visiting American
Republican, enamored with the
idea of a U.S. nobility, would aid
and abet them in their “‘rebel”
effort. Wyke and Fekete travel
on to Princeton where they have
promised to wave the Con-
federate flag in lieu of the Union
Jack.

Prepare yourself. The annual
mass pilgrimage of alumni to
our quiet little town of Lex-
ington is going to take place this
weekend — only this time in
duplicate.

Yes indeed, for every ex-
General motoring down ol’ 81 to
spend a couple of days
reminiscing grain parties and
road trips past, you can bet
your parking place there is an
ex-Keydet right behind him.
Due to an unadjustable schedul-
ing problem, W&L and VMI are
both having Homecoming this
weekend.
| According to Alumni Board

 

' Homecoming 1977:
Alumni, Parents, Dates To Flood Lexington

Chairman Ray Washburn, this
has happened before and will
most likely happen again in the
future. The problem is this:
VMI plays most of its football
games away due to increased
revenues from away games.
Therefore, the home game
schedule is limited, usually to
just enough games for
Homecoming and Parents’
Weekend. Since Washington
and Lee alumni also want a
football game on these two oc-
casions, there is always the
possibility of a conflict.
Washburn said the dates for
these two occasions are usually
set at the Alumni board’s May
meeting and at that time at-

tempts are made to cooperate
with VMI’s_ scheduling, but
“sometimes things just don’t
work out.”’

Unfortunately, that does not
help several hundred destitute
females whose dates have been
unsuccessful in finding them
shelter for the weekend. There
is not a hotel room available
within 30 miles of Lexington,
and many of these hapless
stranded will be forced to shut-
tle to and from their far-away
homes or (dare I suggest) tem-
porarily accommodate fraterni-
ty houses, dorm rooms, and
apartments.

Just how early does one need
to make a reservation in this

quaint little town of 8,000?
“Depending on the weekend,
about two or three months in ad-
vance,” says Holiday Inn
manager Ken Myrick.
‘However, for such occasions
as Homecoming and Parents’
Weekend, reservations are
often made a full year in ad-
vance.”

To help work out scheduling
conflicts with other surrounding
schools for the rest of the year,
the annual ‘Peaks of Otter’
Conference is going to take
place in Staunton this week so
that each school can present its
proposed calendar of events
and avoid conflicts with major
weekends such as W&L’s Fan-

cy Dress. SAB Co-chairman Bill
Tucker will be among four
students representing W&L.

Because of the huge numbers
of people in Lexington this
weekend, and to avoid the mass
hysteria which often results
(Alumni were once just like you
and me you know), the Lex-
ington Police have asked that
individuals exercise extreme
caution in driving in and around
the city.

Also, after checking with
various restaurants around
Lexington, I have found it
highly recommended that
reservations be made or that

you come very early, as there

are sure to be large crowds

EC Survey Shows
Honor Code Alive

by Jim Parker

W&L students value highly
the honor system, have trust in
their peers, and believe un-
trustworthy pupils should leave
the school. At least this is what
can generally be concluded
from a summer survey of W&L
students. Also, there is an over-
whelming support of the in-
dependent exam schedule both
by W&L undergraduates and
law school pupils.

The survey was a question-
naire sent to all 1706 W&L
students. 664, or 41 per cent
responded to it. The remaining
number (including this writer)
found the survey more useful
for playing waste can basket-
ball than as a contributing fac-
tor to the poll. However, as Jim
Underhill, E. C. president said,
the results would not have
varied much if a larger amount
had filled out the sheet. This ap-
pears quite likely, considering
the overwhelming agreement of
answers relating to the ques-
tions on the survey.

The poll consisted of four
basic questions, with sub ques-
tions for numbers 1 and 2. The
questions, as E.C. vice presi-
dent George Griffin stated,
were designed for ‘‘a general
overview ”’ of opinions of the stu-
dent body to garner a consensus
of how W&L pupils feel about
the honor system. For those
who don’t remember what was
asked or never looked at the
survey paper, these were the
questions:

la) Do you value highly the
concept of an honor system at
W&L?

ib) Do you think the students
generally value highly the con-
cept of an honor system at
W&L?

2a) Do you have a high level
of confidence in the trustwor-
thiness of other students at
W&L?

2b) Do you think the students
have a generally high level of
confidence in the trustwor-
thiness of other students at
W&L?

3) Do you think that a student
who cannot be trusted to be
honest should leave W&L?

4) So you think the use of an
independent exam schedule (as
distinguished from the more
traditional schedule where all
students in the same course
take the exam at the same time
undermines confidence in the
honor and trustworthiness of
the students?

The results, according to Jim
Underhill, came as no surprise.
The responses among the
undergraduates to the first five
questions were nearly all yes
votes (over 90 per cent, 99 per
cent on the first question) and
answers to the last question
were no in most cases (12 per
cent yes). Among the law
school, %4 of the students voted
yes on every question but the
last one, which over *4voted no
on. The only noticeable devia-
tion in the figures was a lack of
responses from the second and
third year law students.
Whereas the freshman through
senior undergraduates and
fourth year law school classes
averaged around 40 per cent
answering the survey, only 21
per cent of third year law
graduates and 29 per cent of se-
cond year law graduates did
likewise.

Since less law graduates fill-
ed out the survey, less law
students wrote remarks on the

Noise Violations;

Police Crack Down

by Neil Cote

Recent problems between the
town’s people and the frater-
nities have forced the Lexington
Police Department into strictly
enforcing an old local ordinance
concerning how much noise will
be tolerated at fraternity
houses during parties.

The ordinance, 15-31 and 15-32
in Section B of the town’s laws,
forbids Lexington residents and
students from creating noise so
it can be heard more than 50
feet away from its focal point
between the hours of 11 p.m. un-
til 7 a.m. Although the police
have been somewhat lenient
with the ordinance in past
years, numerous complaints
from local residents have com-
pelled the police to visit frater-

nities almost every night, and
ordering the members to tune
down the music.

“It used to be that the people
would tolerate some commotion
from the fraternities,’ said
Lexington Police Chief Kirby.
“But this year, the problem has
grown all out of proportion. We
don’t want to arrest or fine
anybody, but, unless we receive
some cooperation from the
fraternity houses, we will have
no choice.”’

Chief Kerby went on to say
that although he hopes it won’t
happen, the police department
reserves the right to fine of-
fenders up to $1000 and sentenc-
ing habitual offenders to one
year in prison. As of now, most-

NUMBER 4

Union To
Book
Cockpit

The Student Activities Board
suffered more than a $4,000 cut
in its proposed budget, and then
had an additional $2,200 taken
away from it and given to a
group called the Music Union at
Monday’s_three-and-one-half
hour Executive Committee
meeting.

The Music Union, formerly
the Progressive Music Club, in
cooperation with the SAB, will
take over one of the main func-
tions of the University Center
Committee: booking acts into
the Cockpit. The University
Center Committee had
previously been controlled
directly by the SAB. Music
Union advocates said they
believed the Union would have
better contacts with local musi-
cians and would be able to book
acts into the Cockpit for as lowa

‘price as possible. Previously,

the SAB had subscribed to a ser-
vice called ‘Coffee House,’
which sent in acts sporadically
and at a relatively high cost.
The SAB had originally asked
for $33,850. Included in that
budget was $2,200 for Cockpit
entertainment. The E.C. in its
preliminary budget is
allocating $29,550 to the SAB, in-

Traveler

From

Altruria

In my more rhapsodical
moments (when I’m not bang-
ing on this damn typewriter) I
think Washington and Lee
University has an ebullient,
creative power of diversity
quenched by the steeped tradi-
tions of socially phlegmatic
oligarchy. But most of the time
I think W&L is too damn con-
servative. Of course that’s only
one man’s opinion so, being the
good reporter I am, I went into
the streets, classrooms and
especially, bars to get the other
side of the story. I came out of
the bars with a black eye, but
here are the “grass root”
answers to my question: Is
W&L too conservative?

A: “Yes.’’ Unfortunately, I
made the mistake of asking this
question to a girl who would
have said yes to anything. For-
tunately, I had the presence of
mind to rephrase the question,
giving it a different ‘‘thrust,”
and making the answer far
more satisfactory in the long-
run.

A: “No, I think W&L is ac-
tually much too liberal,’’ said
an unidentified gentleman in a
white hood. ‘‘But we didn’t even
allow blacks in the school until
1970,” I protested. That’s when
I got a ‘“‘White Russian” thrown
in my face. Anda black eye.

A: “I don’t know.” The
answer which is the bane of ex-
istence to every noble pollster;
it was the answer given by
every female I happened to run
into. Also every female I
stumbled over. I must admire
these females though, they have
obviously studied the teachings
of Socrates; when you are ig-
norant, admit it. ‘‘For those
who know they don’t know are
wiser in some respects,”
Socrates would have said if he
hadn’t tried to get high on
hemlock, ‘‘at least they know
something.’’ Like what alchohol
does to your brain?

The results of my seren-
dipitous study go like this: One
person believed W&L is too
liberal, one person believed
W&L is too conservative, and
the other 498 either said “I don’t
know,” grunted or threw up.
One person said “Hubba, hub-
ba.’’ His answer was disregard-
ed. Conclusion? Don’t ask an
intelligent question on the
weekend.

has been testing five hypotheses
concerning the culture of the
Scotch-Irish at the time of the
Hall. Historically, the Scotch-
Irish settlers in this area have
been portrayed as crude fron-
tiersmen, unconcerned with
asthetics. They are thought.to
have been somewhat culturally
isolated. So far, the artifacts,
which include French gun
flints, British and Chinese
ceramics and several small
Spanish coins show that these
attitudes could be incorrect.

A group of close to 30 students
and adults participated in the
dig’s most successful season to
date. About a dozen of these
people came from schools such
as Clarion State in Penn-
sylvania, Sweet Briar, VMI,
and Tulane. Another group of
the same size was sent by Ear-
thwatch, an educational and
research program run by the
Center of Field Research in
Boston. The group of people
who directed the operation con-
sisted of former Washington
and Lee student and Liberty
Hall scholar, John Armstrong
1977, W&L seniors Kurt Russ,
Charlie Hall, Hank McKelway
and Mark Derbyshire. The staff
was rounded out by Parker Pot-
ter 1979, and Andy Holds 1980.

Last summer’s work centered
in three basic areas. The group
completed work left unfinished
last year on the spring house,
which they estimated to have
been in use up until about 1930.
The purpose in attempting to
date the spring house was to try
to determine whether or not it
was part of the original Liberty
Hall campus. So far, there has
been insufficient evidence to
establish a link between the
two. This Fall’s analysis of the
artifacts produced by the inten-

sive excavation of this structure
should yield an initial occupa-
tion date.

The expedition has also con-
tinued work inside the Hall in-
self. This work is part of a
desire to substantiate specula-
tion about the features of Liber-
ty Hall itself. As well, there was
an extensive search for small
artifacts, which could lend
some insight into the culture of
the Scotch-Irish, who built the
Hall in 1793.

The third area in which the
expedition dug was on the site of
a red brick farm house just
behind the baseball diamond.
Through the minutes of a Liber-
ty Hall Academy Trustee’s
meeting, the group found
evidence that the Academy
campus included not only Liber-
ty Hall, but also a steward’s
house, a rector’s house and a
number of other out buildings.
According to the minutes, the
brick for the rector’s house was
“burned (fired) on the site (of
the rector’s house)”. The
minutes also indicated that the
rector’s house was built in 1799.
Through survey of the site, the
expedition found a brick kiln,
which they dated at around
1800. Because of the close prox-
imity of the two dates, the group
believes that they have found
the original site of the rector’s
house.

On the same site, however,
the expedition found other foun-
dations, which are not part of
the red brick farm house. Due
to this subsequent find, the
group is not able to determine
for sure whether or not the red
brick farm house is indeed the
original rector’s house. Further
analysis this fall should indicate
the exact location of the rec-
tor’s house on the site.

Undergrads Included

Law School Plans Fun

by Galen Trussell

Washington and Lee’s Stu-
dent Bar Association (SBA)
asked for a 95 per cent return on
money paid by law students for
student tax, during the E.C.
budget hearings Monday.

Before this year the SBA had
been receiving only approx-
imately 80 per cent of the
money paid by law students for
the student tax. SBA president
Ray Leven felt that the request
for 95 per cent was justified
because the student tax is‘used
primarily for undergraduate
activities which don’t affect law
students.

Leven said that he didn’t
think law students were involv-
ed in 20 per cent of
undergraduate activities. He
explained that law students just
aren’t interested in attending
grain parties or beer busts. He
added that services such as the
Calyx and Ariel are focused
primarily on undergrads, but
had been partially financed
with law students’ student tax.

Leven said law students are
more interested in throwing
smaller parties with a more
‘“‘family’’ atmosphere than
undergrad parties. He explain-

eww rrr ner wreerres eruveve

ed that the slice of SBA money
that is budgeted towards the
SBA Social Committee is used
to throw two dances and to sub-
sidize smaller parties in in-
dividual law students’ apart-
ments.

Leven claimed that with the
increased money the SBA
Social Committee would throw
more parties and invite the
undergraduate community to
them. However, Leven said the
SBA Social Committee did not
yet have any specific plans for
this type party.

Originally the SBA asked for
a total budget of $11,760, out of
which $4,500 would be spent on
social activities. The E.C.,
however, arrived at a figure of
$10,060 for the total SBA budget.
The figure won’t. be final until
after the E.C. meeting next
Monday.

Another proposal Leven
brought up was that of allowing
the SBA access to funds before
the E. C. budget hearings.
Leven explained that law
students start school as early as
mid-August but have no funds
until October, when the E.C.
holds budget hearings.

 

Contact Begins With
Scotland Yard Director

by Jim Ingham

This year’s Contact program
gets under way next week on
Thursday night, when the Con-
tact Committee presents Sir
Robert Mark, Director of New
Scotland Yard in England. He is
the first of a projected list of six
to ten speakers. Admission for:
the 8:00 forum is free and the
program will be held in Lee
Chapel.

Sir Robert has a long and
distinguished record in the law
enforcement area. He served as
Commissioner of the London
Metropolitan Police from
1972-1977, and in this time, rid
the force of the corruption and
stealth that had _ thrived
undected by the press and
government. As commissioner,
Sir Robert went on to polish the
tarnished image the police
force had acquired from these
disclosures. After completing
this project, he retired. Sir
Robert has since come out of
retirement and is now Director
of the New Scotland Yard.

This year’s Contact Commit-
tee has altered its plans slightly
from years past. The bulk of the

program had usually been
scheduled in March, where as
many as four or five speakers
have been presented. This year,
however, the Committee’s pro-
gram will be more evenly
distributed throughout the year.
At least one more speaker will
be coming before Christmas
Vacation and in the months of
January and February there
will be an additional two or
three.

Another change in the pro-
gram will be the absence of a
particular theme. Billy
Webster, Co-chairman of the
committee along with Walter
Granruth, said, ‘‘The themes
weren’t being followed at all, so
we just discarded the entire
idea.”

Anyone who knows of a
speaker that they would like to
hear or could possibly get to
come to W&L should contact
either Webster or Granruth.
The Contact Committee’s list of
speakers is based solely on
choices that the students
themselves make, according to
Webster.

Tucker renovation

by Mark W. Danos

The reorganization of Tucker
Hall was completed this past
summer for the use by the
language department. Work
began according to Frank Par-
sons, assistant to the president,
“during the summer of 1976
when we started the library. It
roughly coincided with the
move from Tucker Hall to
Lewis Hall by the law school.”’

Tucker now houses the
language departments and
classrooms. Remodeling was
done, especially to the third
floor, to provide the kind of
classrooms the language
department needs. This was
done by subdividing large
classrooms. The language lab
will be moved to the third floor
of Tucker Hall, probably in the
large west classroom.

The remodeling was done by

fj-e enn emanate

W.W. Coffey and Sons, Inc., and
the schools’ Building and
Grounds. Robinson Hall is being
expanded at the present time
for the additional needs of the
Mathematic Department.

The first floor of Reid Hall,
the home of the Journalism
Department, presently is being

In keeping with all the tradi-
tions that make up Washington
and Lee, the sixteen frater-
nities, the Student Association
for Black Unity, and the Law
School laid the way for the up-
coming Homecoming Weekend |
by nominating their respective
“Queen”’ contestants. With a
few exceptions, this year’s girls
come from area colleges and
many are Art majors.

First of all, the nomination of
Beta Theta Pi is Vonna Forsyth,
a junior from Hollins. Vonna is
a French major from Reister-
town, Maryland. Junior Sandy
McDonald will escort Vonna on-
to the football field at halftime
on Saturday.

Sweet Briar senior Lucy Dar-
by will represent W&L’s newest
fraternity, Chi Psi. Peter Keefe,
cofounder and incumbent presi-
dent of Chi Psi, will be Miss
Darby’s escort.

Meanwhile at Delta Tau
Delta, house brother Coates
Simons of Chalestown, South
Carolina will present Hollins
junior Nancy Novak to the
Homecoming crowd. Nancy is a
studio art major from
Baltimore.

Saturday’s audience will be
treated to, among other things,
the ‘‘odd couple” of Kappa
Alpha. The swinging pair to
represent W&L’s lone Alpha
chapter are Randolph Macon’s
Allison Wilkinson from Con-
cord, North Carolina and Byron
Hale Delavan, Jr. from upper
New York state.

Representing Lambda Chi
Alpha will be Margaret Wren, a
freshman from Mary Baldwin.
Says Hunt Shuford, a
sophomore from Richmond of
his date, ‘‘she looks good in wet
hair.’’ Miss Wren, a resident of
Siler City, North Carolina,
however will probably have the
dry look Saturday afternoon.

The Law School will present

  

Betsy M. Callicott as its choice
for royal honors. Her escort,
Stan Brading of Lexington, is a
second year law student. Miss
Callicott is a veteran of five
weeks at Lewis Hall.

Houstonian senior George
“Scooter’’ Smith will team up
with Sweet Briar sophomore
Susan Smith, (contrary to any
rumors, the two are unrelated
and unmarried), to represent
Phi Delta Theta at the
Homecoming ceremonies. Miss
Smith hails from  Tulsa,.
Oklahoma.

Phi Gamma Delta, better
known as the FIJI’s, will match
up Charlie Brown and Randy
Mac’s Ellen Schall. Miss Schall,
a proficient swimmer from
Virginia Beach, is in her second
year at RMWC.

Phi Kappa Psi has nominated
Sharon Terry, an Economics
student at Randolph Macon.
Escorting the Phi Psi designate
from Charlotte, North Carolina,

Phi Delta Theta '
for the coveted throne will be
Andrew Fitzgerald from
Potomac, Maryland.

Wendy McClatchey, A Hollins
sophomore who has modeled for
‘‘Mademoiselle,’’ will take a
crack at the coronation for Phi
Kappa Sigma. Peter ‘‘Botts’’
Meem, from Bluefield, West
Virginia, will stand at the side
of the beautiful blonde lass.

Phi Kappa Alpha’s Chuck Sip-
ple, hailing from Savannah,
Georgia, will excort fellow

Young Demos

by Tony Carli

Last year, an article in the
RtP, published soon after
Carter’s election victory,
reported that somehow the club
had “‘managed to find 33 cam-
pus Democrats willing to pay
dues.’’ Well, that was last year.
Now, the Washington and Lee
Young Democrats are gaining
more recognition. Lee Cave, a
junior and a philosophy major,
might just be the only YD presi-
dent to have taken over an ac-
tive organization.

RtP: Along with the rebirth of
your organization came many
snide remarks and snickering.
Now that this type of reaction
has subsided, how would you
assess your club’s standing,
after matriculation and the first
three weeks of classes?

Cave: You never do as well as
you like to do, but we have
made such remarkable pro-
gress over last year that I can-
not help but be happy.

RtP: When you talk of progress,
to what are you referring?
Cave: As far as membership is
concerned, we have had an in-
crease of over 135% since last
May. We've approximately
eighty due-paying members
with over twenty more students
who are soon to join. Also, we
possess a list of more than one
hundred who we consider pro-
spects.

Pledging

down
significantly

by Chip Hughes

Fraternity rush, a longtime
tradition and major Fall social
activity at W&L, has ended —
and has ended with some very
surprising results. Even though
deferred rush is in progress, all
indications point to a noticeable
decline in the number of
freshmen pledging fraternities
this year as compared to years
past. At many houses, the drop
off ranges from 25 to 40 percent.
To better understand the causes
of this year’s ‘slow rush,” it is
necessary to examine closely
the attitudes of the three major
groups involved in rush: the
freshman class, the frater-
nities, and the IFC.

The freshman class, 97 per-
cent of which signed up for
rush, appear to share the relief
that most fraternities have con-
ducted a poorly organized,
unenthusiastic rush this year.
The freshmen questioned for
this article felt that at many
fraternities, members were
preoccupied with such things as
seeing old friends and meeting
girls and had neither the time
nor the desire to meet prospec-
tive pledges. Also, the freshman
class as a whole seems to be
more aware of the alternatives
to fraternity lite; consequently’
freshmen seem to be weighing
their decisions a little more
carefully. This may be due in
part to the IFC's presentation at
Natural Bridge. in which
freshmen were advised to take
their time and consider various
options in making fraternity
decisions. As one freshman in-
dependent succinctly put it, “I
went through rush and didn't
really meet a bunch'of guys |
liked that much, so I'm going in-
dependent."

Theatre plans
activities

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor

Work is building up to its
usual fever-pitch at the Univer-
sity Theatre this fall. With
Oedipus Rex recently cast and
now well into rehearsals under
Prof. Lee Kahn, business atten-
tion turns to other matters.

UT officers elected

The theatre’s annual open
house and business meeting
was held recently. Among the
items up for discussion was the
election of new officers at UT.
All people who have worked in
any capacity for the theatre on
a show are eligible to vote, and
this year’s polling brought up
the following officers. Warren
Mowry, a senior, was elected
president for 1977-78, and is
basically in charge of all liason
matters between the theatre
and ‘‘the hill,” including the
E.C. Hunt Brown, a junior this
year, is the new House
Manager, in charge of handling
box office workers and ushers
for each show. And Barry Godia
will serve as this year’s Publici-
ty Director of the UT; all
publicity work, from flyers to
posters to radio blurbs is under
his call.

The Ring-Tum Phi con-
gratulates these individuals on
their accomplishment and
‘urges all students interested in
working in any area of the
theatre to contact one of these
three.

 

 

 

Open auditions
coming next week

 

In other business; prepara-
tions are now under way for
auditions for the second UT pro-
duction: the 18th century com-
edy Beaux Strategem. As
always, auditions are open to all
members of the student body,
and will be held next Thursday
and Friday, October 13-14, at 4-5
and 7-9 p.m. in the Troubadour
Theatre.

The comedy is a rolicking
portrait of that special
phenomenon of the 18th cen-
tury, the adventurer. An easy
comparison can be drawn bet-
ween the men in this play and
Fielding’s Tom Jones, both fill-
ed with riotous scenes of life in
the country houses and inns of
England.

Beaux Strategem, originally
produced in 1707, will be done
mainly in the style of the period,
with a lot of music and women.
A special note to W&L students
is that this play has a lot of nice,
distinctive, good-sized but not
overwhelmingly large male
roles. These parts would be
perfect for any student with an
interest in theatre and some
measure of talent, but without
the hours necessary to master a
lead role.

The show is to be directed by
Prof. Al Gordon, with
assistance from Stage Manager
John Jacobsen. The show is
slated to open in the
Troubadour on November 30,
right after Thanksgiving break.

Scripts may be picked up in the
Troubadour now, so sign one out
if you are interested.

Finally, Prof. Gordon has an-
nounced a program of ‘reading
theatre,’’ where plays are read
together and aloud by a small
group. This program is with
Sweet Briar College, and will
begin there on the evening of
October 18, Tuesday night, with
a group reading of a Shaw play.

Following readings will take
place on the W&L campus. For
futher details, please contact
Dr. Gordon in duPont Hall.
Those who are interested and
have forgotten to sign up,
please do so immediately with
Dr. Gordon.

NEXT WEEK: a special

preview of the soon-to-open
Oedipus Rex.....

“Lincoln” and “Silver Streak”’

The Land of Oz

by Seth Oserin

It looks like our friends at the
State saved us from the
demoralizing experience of the
Bad News Bears in the
Astrodome. However, with a
delay of two days (taken up by

an extension of the run of.

“Smokey and the Bandit’’),
Lexington will. become.a
premiere, first run city. Yes
folks, for the first time since
“Godzilla Blows Lunch on
Tokyo,” Lexington will be a
world premiere city (along with

about a hundred others)! The
movie is “The Lincoln Con-
spiracy.”’ Although there are no
real big “‘names,”’ the movie
should, at the least, prove to be
very interesting. It’s a two week
run, and I’ll have a review on it

(as if anyone cares) next
week... Another flick worth see-
ing is over at the Lyric this
week. Gene Wilder, Richard
Pryor, and Jill Clayburgh (of
“1776” fame) star in “Silver

Streak,’ a comedy about
murder and a runaway train. It
is great. See it.

Did you see the ‘‘Trial of Lee
Harvey Oswald’’ on TV this
past weekend? If you didn’t,
you didn’t miss much. Based on
fact, it was a presentation of
what his trial probably would
have been like had Oswald not
been shot. The direction was
horrible, the acting mediocre,
and the script was despicable.
Too bad, it was a good idea....

Century Fox plans on blowing it

€ye and Ear:
from the Bookstore

by Betty Munger

So now, in the interests of
equal rights let’s consider the
advantages of professors over
books. (Which, by the way, is
right generous of me, as a
bookperson! )

Probably the most important
thing which professors have
that books don’t have is ears.
Coming, as they do, in all sizes
and shapes, they listen. Pro-
fessors can rephrase, re-
explain and re-examine (no pun
intended) areas of material
which might be puzzling to the
rest of us. They can brighten
dull corners with occasional dry
wit and take time to spot the
gleam of understanding in our
eyes when ideas blossom.

Professors have other uses.
They have been known to rout
out a student when he hasn’t

 

shown up for an important ex-
am. They are very good when
chatting with anxious mothers
and fathers on Parents
Weekend about how well their
son is doing in class considering
how little time he spent study-
ing. The faculty provides a
vociferous cheering section at
lacrosse games—even I will add
a screech or two on these occa-
sions.

Professors are experts on the
alphabet—at least from A to F
and set great store by the
students being equally concern-
ed about these six letters. And
lastly, they are capable of smil-
ing happily and sharing a beer
in a purely social fashion—
which, is something no
publisher has yet been able to
build into a book.

 

 

all to make a TV series out of
“Star Wars’’ .... Mel Brooks has
a new movie, called “High Anx-
iety,”’ coming out during
Speaking about
“Star Wars,” the domestic box
office of our sci-fi Gone With the
Wind has already passed
through the $155 million mark,
and is still going strong.

Last week I predicted Andy
Gibb’s “I Just. Want to be Your

Everything’’ would be number
one for all pop singles for 1977.
Well, it is now evident that it
will have some huge competi-
tion. After debuting at number
50 on the Variety top 50 chart

19 before proceeding to number
two. That’s the number two spot
in only two weeks’ Further-
more, as though that isn’t
enough, Ronnie McDowell’s

Gone,’’ debuted at number 9,
and is now standing at number
4. Can’t remember anything

Local
artist
exhibiting
work

Mr. Raymond Twiddy, of
Sweet Briar College, will be ex-
hibiting a collection of prints in
duPont Art Gallery beginning
the evening of Monday, October
10, and running through Friday,
October 28, sponsored by the
W&L Fine Arts department.

Again, there will be a wine

7 until 9 p.m., to give students a
chance to talk to Mr. Twiddy in-
formally. The reception will be
in the main room of the gallery,
and all are welcome to attend.

The artist has exhibited in

Garo Z. Antreasian and -John
Sommers, 19th and 20th century
graphics with Cleta Downey,
and photo-printmaking with
Richard Graf at the University
of California at Berkeley.

His works have been shown at
the Franz Bader Gallery in
Washington, D.C., and the
Ward-Nasse Gallery in New
York. He has also had a large
number of one-man, two-man
and group shows all over
Virginia and the south east.

His work has been seen in
Lexington before; he par-
ticipated in Virginia Military
Institute’s Mini-Festival of the
Arts in January 1976.

Nickel & Diamond Theatre
New season announced

by M. Gray Coleman

The Nickel and Diamond
Theatre, Lexington’s communi-
ty showcase for theatrical
talent, has recently announced
its plans for the upcoming year,
according to Ginger McNeese,
Theatrical Director.

It will be a three-show season,
kicking off with Jean Kerr’s
comedy ‘‘Mary, Mary.”
Directed by Will Cantler, a re-
cent graduate of W&L, the
show will be in production in
early November. ‘Mary,
Mary’ is a light comedy about a
recently divorced husband and
wife, who are brought together
again due to the husband’s pre-
sent difficulty with the IRS. His
ex-wife, Mary, is only too glad
to become involved in the
brouhaha that develops, and on-
ward goes the plot to its natural,
funny end. As Ms. McNeese
puts it, ‘“Taxes, divorce, recon-
ciliation... the universality of
the show and problems it covers

Later plans for the other two
shows include a winter dinner-
theatre production of the 1930’s
style musical, ‘‘Dames at Sea,”’
and hopefully a_ full-scale
musical in the spring.

The theatre’s board of direc-
tors has been broadened, and
all are optimistic about the new
season, but certain problems
must be overcome soon, said
McNeese. One is the lack of any
permanent facility for per-
formances. The old Nickel and
Diamond, in the basement of
Old Main Mall, has been bought
and occupied by the W&L
theatre, for their expanding
Boiler Room facility. And
technical people are greatly
needed, especially those with
some expertise in lighting. if
any of this interests you, please

HARRY RLEMS4 GALLERY

  

by Mark Mainwaring
Associate Music Director
WLUR-FM and Ward Boult

To begin this week’s
Mainstream, you'll find album
reviews on two comedy artist—
one up and coming and one
down and going. First, the bad
news.

On the Road
George Carlin
Little David LD 1075

George Carlin, as just about
everyone knows, was one of the
first youth-oriented, ‘‘anti-
establishment’? (remember
that term?) comedians to real-
ly hit the big time. His ap-
pearances on the old Flip
Wilson program and guest host
spots on the Tonight Show rare-
ly failed to leave the audience in
stitches. Even after several
years, in fact, his early albums
(AM/FM and Class Clown, for
example) seem nearly as
hilarious as they were the first
time around.

Unfortunately, Carlin’s new
album, On the Road, is further
evidence that ol: George isn’t
as funny as he used to be. The
routines on this LP range from
‘“‘Death and Dying’’ to ‘‘Kids,”’
and most of them just don’t
work. Most of the time, Carlin
seems to be simply rehashing
the same old stuff (or the same
type of stuff, anyway) to the
same old audience. To be sure,
On the Road does have its
moments; for example,
Carlin,s ideas on what to do
with the ‘‘Two Minute Warn-
ing’’ he says you get just before
death. If he wishes to remain

Ring-tum Phi, Oct. 6, 1977, Page 5

Musical Mainstream

successful, though, George
Carlin will have to move on to
some fresher material. We’ve
heard most of this before, and
it’s wearing a little thin.

Let’s Get Small
Steve Martin
Warner Brothers BSK 3090

Steve Martin, for any of you
who’ve spent the last six mon-
ths in a cave, is currently the
hottest comedian around. A
comparison here to George
Carlin is in some ways in-
evitable. Martin’s comedy, like
Carlin’s, is geared to a young
audience, and Martin owes
much of his popularity to recent
appearances on NBC’s Satur-
day Night and the Tonight Show
(where, like Carlin, he has serv-
ed as guest host).

The similarities end there,
however. Steve Martin’s new
album (his only LP so far),
Let’s Get Small, contains fresh,
new material. And even without
the visual cues and gags which
Martin frequently uses in his
stage act, the stuff on this
album is very funny. In addition
to such familiar routines as
“Excuse Me” and ‘“‘Let’s Get
Smail,”’ the LP contains ple.nty
of short, individual gems. Mar-
tin reveals his beginnings as a
comic (’’I started off at the bot-
tom. I was born a poor black
child.’’), the secret of his suc-
cess as a comedian (’’Before I
come out I put a slice of bologna
in each of my shoes. So when
I’m on stage, I feel funny.’’),
and finally, his solution to the
world population problem
("death penalty for parking
violations.’’). Let’s Get Small is

the best comedy album I’ve
heard in quite a while, and I
highly recommend it.

Cheap Trick
In Color
Epic PE34884

From the first line, ‘Hello
there, ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready to rock&’’ It isn’t
hard to ascertain what will
follow-fun lovin’ rock ’n roll.
Because let’s face it, Cheap
Trick is fun. In Color, their se-
cond effort, is ample proof.

Trick is made up of two pretty
faces, in the spirit of Peter
Frampton (lead vocalist and
rhythm guitarist Robin Zander
and bass player Tom Peterson)
and what looks like a modern
day Laurel and Hardy team
(drummer Ben E. Carlos and
lead guitarist Rick Nielson.)
Robin Zanders vocals fit Trick
to the T. (no pun intended) One
of the albums’ strong points is
that you just have to ‘“‘sing
along.” Admittedly, these are
some of the corniest lyrics
around, but on tunes like ‘‘Oh
Caroline’’ even the most
gourmet audiophile can’t help
but sing along with Zander;

In listening to tunes like
‘‘Downed’’‘‘Southern Girls’,
and ‘‘So Good To See You,’’ CT
is easily comparable to late
Beatles and perhaps The Who.
But they have that distinct
American Rock ‘n Roll flavor,
as well. Heavies include ‘Big
Eyes’’, “You're All Talk’’ and
‘Clock Strickes Ten.”’

In ‘Downed’: Zander sings
‘‘All you Walk is a Fine Line,”’

Sprunt receives endowed chair

An endowed professorship of
Bible in the Department of
Religion at Washington and Lee
University has been established
in memory of the late Fletcher
Otey Thomas by his children.

David Worth Sprunt, pro-
fessor of religion at W&L and
university chaplain, has been
named the first Fletcher Otey
Thomas Professor of Bible.

The announcements’ were
made today by Washington and
Lee President Robert E. R.
Huntley at W&L’s opening con-

vocation today, the first
university-wide assembly of the
new academic year.

Mr. Thomas was a prominent
religious, business and civic
leader in Bedford, Va., until his
death in 1948.

The new professorship in his
memory ‘‘perpetuates the
teaching of Bible as a point of
major emphasis in the religion
department”’ in recognition of
the donors’ interest in ‘superior
teaching of Christian theology,”’
Huntley said.

Mr. Thomas, a native of Bed-
ford County, lived all his life in
Bedford. He was a co-founder
and long-time director of Pied-
mont Label Co. in Bedford and
was superintendent of the Sun-
day school, a deacon, and an
elder in the Bedford
Presbyterian Church.

Dr. Sprunt, the newly named
Fletcher Otey Thomas Pro-
fessor of Bible, has taught at

department in 1956 and was
named university chaplain four
years later.

He is a B.A. graduate of
Davidson College and received
his bachelor’s and doctoral
degrees in theology from Union

Theological Seminary, Rich-
mond.
His fields of teaching

specialization include both the
Old and New Testaments. He is
a member of the National
Association of Biblical Instruc-
tors and the National Associa-
tion of College Chaplains.

He is chairman of the
Virginia State Advisory Com-
mittee to the United States Civil
Rights Commission, a member

of the board of visitors of
Eckerd College, and an officer
in several area mental-health,
retardation, and drug-abuse
service agencies.

He is married to the former
Elise Miller, and they have
three children.

The Fletcher Otey Thomas
Professorship in Bible is
Washington and Lee’s sixth en-
dowed professorship. The oldest
is the Society of the Cincinnati
professorship in mathematics,
established before the Civil War
when the Virginia branch of
that organization, of which
George Washington had been a
member, dissolved itself and
gave its entire treasury to the
college Washington had endow-
ed.

Generals Win

Doubleheader

by Chris Fay

By winning their fourth game
‘in five outings last Saturday
over Eastern Mennonite, the
Generals are sporting their best
record, 4-1, since the 1964 team
was 5-0. The J.V. team also won
its match against E.M.

The Generals’ perfect record
was blemished on September
28, when the University of Rich-
mond slipped by W&L by a
score of 2-1. In the Richmond
game the team did not play up
to par, but still only lost by one
goal. One player, when ques-
tioned about the game, simply
said, “It sucked.”

In the Mennonite game the
team was hampered by the wet
and slick field. Players who
tried sliding tackles often found
themselves six feet of target
and still sliding. The Generals
had a difficult time controlling
the offense as their passing
game suffered, because the ball
was too wet to handle.

The Generals’ lone goal came
midway through the second half
on a penalty kick. Kelly Ryan
took the shot about _ twenty
yards to the right of the Men-
nonite goal. Once again Dave
Williams scored by heading the
ball into the net. That was
William’s fifth goal of the year.

Washington and -Lee is still
unscored upon in their four wins

to date, defeating the opposition
9-0 in those four contests. Senior
goalie Mark Bennett, the
ODAC’s leading goalkeeper has
had a hand in each of those four
shutouts. The team and in-
dividual record for shutouts is
currently five, and that mark is
certainly in jeopardy this
season.

In the JV game Eastern Men-
nonite scored first in the second
half. However the Generals did
not give up, and responded with
three goals in twenty minutes.
This was their strongest offen-
sive drive this season.

The JV team lost their first
two games of the season. At
James Madison, the first game
of the season, the Generals
were simply outplayed by a
superior team as they lost 5-0.
In the second game against
Lynchburg College, the JV
team bottomed out early. The
Generals had control of the
game until the Lynchburg team
scored to tie it at 1-1. Lynchburg
put two more goals on the board
and won the game by a score of
3-1.

The Generals host ODAC foe
Roanoke College on Wilson
Field at 3:00 p.m. on Wednes-
day, and play at powerful
Elizabethtown College in Penn-
sylvania on Saturday.

Harriers Grab 4 Out
Of Top 5 Places

by Clem Carter

Washington and Lee’s Cross
Country Team raised its record
to six wins and one loss with a
strong performance in a
quadangular meet here Satur-
day.

The fact that the race was run
in a heavy rain and on a muddy
and slippery track did little to
slow the Generals down. Coach
Miller declared ‘‘We had a good
day, in the rain, mud, and all.”
The Washington and Lee team,
off to its best start since 1972,
dominated the meet with just 19
points. Roanoke College was a
distant second with 44 points.
Emory and Henry and Norfolk
State followed with 83 and 92
points respectively.

Freshman Chris Daniels led
the W&L harriers with first
place overall. He ran the 8000
meter course in 27 minutes and
57 seconds. Bob Bates finished
second overall with a time of 28
min. 25 sec. Allen Weeks and
Richard Bird both came in at 28
min. 37 sec. Weeks was award-
ed the fourth place, third for

W&L; Bird, the fourth man for
the Generals, was fifth place
overall. Brain Adams was
W&L’s fifth man, seventh man
in the meet. His time was 30
minutes even. Bill Welch and
Kevin Grimm placed sixth and
seventh for Washington and
Lee, and ninth and eleventh
overall to round out an excellent
performance by the Generals
top seven men.

Coach Miller feels the team is
steadily improving. The small
time spread between W&L’s
first and seventh man, Coach
Miller said, points to the fact
that on any given day any one of
them could lead the pack.

Washington and Lee travels
to Lynchburg Saturday to com-
pete in another four-way meet.
W&L will face Lynchburg Col-
lege, Virginia Wesleyan and
Norfolk State. Although Coach
Miller discounted any ad-
vantage Lynchburg might have
due to running on their home
course, he did say that they
would be the strongest team
W&L has faced since Davis and
Elkins.

 

Swimmers Undefeated
In League Play

by Jerry Harris

The W&L water polo team
traveled to Columbia, New
York over the weekend for an
important Middle Atlantic Con-
ference tournament. Enspired
by the balanced play of several
key performers, the Generals
came away with an unblemish-
ed record of three wins includ-
ing a stunning upset over John
Hopkins.

By virtue of their three vic-
tories, W&L remained as only
one of two teams in the con-
ference that are undefeated.
W&L will now host an Invita-
tional tournament beginning
this Friday that will provide
some stiff challenges to that ac-
complishment.

Two weeks from now the polo

team will travel to Penn State to
play five conference teams that
will decide whether or not they
will advance to the Eastern
regionals. All of this is a rather
startling development for a first
year team but one that might
have been expected considering
the past success of Coach
Stearns.

In Columbia the Generals
first game was an easy 26-12
conquest of Lehigh University
which was followed by a slightly
closer 12-9 verdict over Saint
Francis. However, it was the
final game, ‘‘the most impor-
tant by far,’’ that showed the
true potential of W&L.

Hopkins was undefeated com-
ing into the march and sporting
impressive credentials such as

the national swimming cham-
pionship from last year.
Ironically, it was the swimming
expertise that cost them the
game. Stearns pointed out that
Hopkins attempted to outswim
W&L which had a disadvantage
in numbers (8 to Hopkins’ 15)
but their strategy took away
from their acting. Coming from
behind on four different occa-
sions, W&L held on for an 11-10

victory.
Stearns pointed out that the
key to W&L’s_ success

throughout the tournament was
balanced scoring and consisten-
cy. Especially effective were
Keith Romich and Scott Duff
(each with 11 goals), Biff Mar-
tin (10 goals), Drew Pillsbury (8
goals) and Bob Newcomb (6
goals).

Football Teams Takes 0-4
Record Into Homecoming

by Jim Barnes
A fumble proned offense and
a sporadic defense contributed
to W&L’s fourth loss in as many
outings last Saturday against
the ODAC defending champion,
Randolph-Macon, by a score of
21-13. The offense turned the
ball four times on four fumbles.
Washington and Lee won the
toss and struck first as quarter-
back Scott Swope connected on
a 23 yard pass to Senior split
end Bill Frear. The PAT was
good and the Generals had an

early 7-0 lead. Swope, a Junior,
making his first start in a varsi-
ty contest, had a good day com-
pleting 14 of 26 passes for 159
yards with two touchdowns.
Coach McHenry was quick to
point out that the offensive line
gave Swope excellent protec-
tion.

Randolph-Macon tied the
game up with 8:18 to play in the
first half when Fulback Mike
Woolfolk ran the ball in from 11

Fifth In State

As expected, Hampton In-
stitute and U. Va. fought it out
for the 1977 Virginia Tennis
Championship, with the Pirates
winning 33-28. The Generals
finished tied for sixth with
Virginia Tech, behind ODU,
Richmond, and William &
Mary.

The second W&L doubles
team of sophomore Pat Norris
and blue-chip freshman Cody
Davis made it to the semifinals,
as did Stewart Jackson in the
number two singles spot. Last

year’s national Division III
doubles champions, Jackson
and Ben Johns, were eliminated
in the quarterfinals. Coach Den-
nis Bussard called this year’s
competition, ‘“‘So much stronger
than in 1976, with five very
strong teams as opposed to two
last fall.’’ The Generals finished
in third place last year in Lex-
ington.

The team is idle until October
14th when they will compete in
the James Madison University
Tournament in Harrisonburg.

tough time all day stopping
RMC on the ground.

With the score tied at 7-7 the
Generals fumbled the ball on
their 43 yard line. Five plays
later, the Yellowjackets scored
on a 12 yard run with 1:53 left on
the clock in the first half. RMC
converted the PAT and held the
lead for the rest of the game.

W&L had an excellent chance

to tie the game up in the second
half when the Generals had the
ball on the RMC two yard line.
Once again the Generals cough-
ed up the ball. The Yellow-
jackets took the ball and march-
ed 91 yards to the W&l seven.
The defense held the Yellow-
jackets on a fourth and two. The
offense took the field and gave
the ball up again on the first
play from scrimmage. RMC
recovered the ball on the 19
yard line. The Yellowjackets
took only five plays for their
final score of the day, as Mike
Woolfolk scampered five yards
into the endzone. The PAT was
good and the score stood 21-7.

Commenting on RMC’s final
score, Coach McHenry was
disappointed with the defense’s
performance. “I realize that it’s
tough for the defense to go right
back on to the field after they’ve
stopped a team after a long
drive,” said McHenry. “But
we've got to develop the mental
toughness to do just that if
we’re to have a_ successful
season.”

The Generals did not fold
completely and put together a
splendid 15 play 86 yard drive.
The drive was capped with a
spectacular catch by
sophomore splitend, Syd Farrar
on a ten yard pass from Swope
with 5:10 left to play. The
Generals tried for a two point
conversion, but failed. The final
score of the game, RMC-21,
W&L-13.

One of the bright spots in the
offense last Saturday was the
running of Sophomore Stewart
Atkinson. Atkinson, making his
‘77 debut after suffering an
ankle injury in preseason, rush-
ed for 102 yards. The General’s
week ground game is ex-
emplified by the fact that the

Angered KickerQuits Football Team

After suffering setback after
setback at the hands of op-
ponents the Football Generals
have been handed a setback of a
different nature—their
“Number One’’ placekicker for
the past two-and-one-half
seasons quit the team Tuesday.

In an interview with the Ring-
tum Phi Tuesday afternoon, ex-
General Dan Thompson said he
became frustrated after pro-
mises were repeatedly broken
and he was not given the op-
portunity to play. He feels situa-
tions have arisen during the
season for which his kicking
abilities were needed, but not
used.

Against Lock Haven State,
Thompson felt there were at
least three occasions in the first
half in which a kicker was need-
ed, but the coaches chose in-
stead to punt or go for the first
down. In the Davidson game,
even though it was obvious the
Generals were going to lose and
the coaches were substituting
heavily, Thompson was not
given the chance to make the
score more respectable or to
gain experience by kicking in a
game situation.

In the controversial Centre
game, Thompson believes the
coaches should have attempted
a field goal instead of punting.
“In the first half, when we were
inside their territory, Sid (Far-
rar) punted the ball into the
endzone, and the ball was’plac-
ed on the 20 yard line. If we had
attempted the field goal, we
possibly could have.scored, and
even if we didn’t, the ball still
would have ended up on the 20. I
think they made a bad decision
in electing to punt.”

Thompson believes that when
a team is in range for a field
goal, it should attempt one. He
said he believes McHenry
knows the value of a good kick-
ing game, but he doesn’t
understand why McHenry
doesn’t use a kicking attack in
his game strategy.

Thompson said he was called
upon to kick some field goals of
over 50 yards in high school
and, as recently as last week,
was putting them through the
goal posts from 55 yards out. He
said he had worked hard all
summer, lifting weights and
kicking almost everyday. He
reported to practice in August
in the best kicking shape and
with the best attitude and self-
confidence he had in his career.
His goals this year had been to
score a lot of points, make all-
conference kicker, and work
towards his long range goal of
becoming a pro.

He said McHenry had told
him on many occasions that he
would be used in the upcoming

games. It never happened. He
said he was only given ten
minutes a week on Friday to
work on his timing with the
team in scrimmage, and most
of this time was spent kicking
PAT’s. He said McHenry
repeatedly told him he was
pleased with his progress and
apologized for not playing him
more. Thompson does _ not
understand this due to the fact
that McHenry seldom had op-
portunities to see him perform
in practice or in games.
Thompson says he regrets not
having approached McHenry
earlier in the season to lodge his
complaints as an alternative to
quitting, but did not feel com-
fortable talking to the head

Alumni Return For
Preseason LaX Opener

W&L’s 1977 Homecoming
Weekend will conclude on Sun-
day, October 9th with the an-
nual Alumni Lacrosse Game
beginning at 12:00 noon on
Wilson Field. All are welcome;
there is no admission.

Head Coach Jack Emmer ex-
pects the best turnout of alumni
in recent memory as all Emmer
coached first-team _ All-
Americans since 1973 will
return to Lexington. That list
reads like a page out of the
Washington and Lee history
book — goalie Skeet Chadwick
(73, 74); defensemen Tom
Keigler (76, 77), Rob Lindsey
(75, 76), and Don Eavenson
(73); midfielders Skip Lichtfuss
(73, 74) and Ted Bauer (72, 73,
74); and attackman Sam
Englehart (71, 72, 73). In addi-
tion to those first . team selec-
tions, also returning to the site
of their glory days will be
second-team All-American at-
tackman Dave Warfield,

honorable mention All-
American Don Carroll, and Rob
Morgan, the school record
holder for goals in one season.

The 1978 W&L lacrosse
Generals will have their work
cut out for them against the
stars of the past. The present
team will be led by co-captains
Charlie Brown in goal and Jay
Sindler at midfield. Brown was
a third-team All-American last
season. Accompanying Brown
and Sindler will be attackmen
Jeff Fritz and John Black, both
50 plus point scorers of a year
ago, midfielders Charlie Stieff,
Mike Schuler, and Sandy
McDonald, and defenseman
Rod Roberts.

Jack Emmer expects a nip
and tuck affair on Sunday, as
most of the returning players
are still playing club ball. The
series currently stands at one
win each, the Alumni winning
17-12 last fall after losing 7-4 in
1975.

IKEVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Season Opens

It is upon us. The all important start of an integral
part of life here at Washington and Lee—the ‘rack
date’’ season. With the Homecoming festivities plann-
ed this weekend, the W&L gentlemen now have a
legitimate excuse to invite up that dainty “‘little
thing”’ he has had his eye on for a long time.

We have been blessed with unusual luck this year.
In the past, there were no questions asked, the girls
stayed in the local motels during the day, partied with
the guys in the afternoon and evening, and returned to
the hotel by midnight to get their essential 14 hours
beauty sleep. But this year, (heh, heh), the motels are
full due to W&L and VMI both having their homecom-
ings.

If you are a “‘veemee,’’ then you are out of luck.
Your girl will have to go back, and you will have a
lousy homecoming. But if you attend W&L, you have
something to fall back on; your charm, your per-
sonality, your room.

Unless you are a freshman. An upperclassman has
the maturity, the experience and knows what it takes
to come up with a quick, convincing excuse as to the
reason why his date doesn’t have a nice, quiet, private
motel room like ‘‘all the other respectable girls.’’ But
a freshman has not been here long enough to develop
the ultimate chivalrous alternative of, ‘‘Don’t worry,
you can stay in my room—I’ll sleep on the floor.”

Don’t worry freshmen, you will learn. It takes time
to develop your charm, personality, and overall
general appearance. It takes time to get used to the
girls up here. The equestrian majors, the home ec
majors, and the ‘“‘probable”’ kindergarten teachers
are a special breed of women, and many times plan A
or even plan B won’t work.

You also don’t know the absolute necessity of hav-
ing a successful “rack date.” It can add so much to
your character, personality, GPA and campus
prestige.

There is no finer feeling than on Sunday afternoon
after your weekend honey has gone back and you and
the guys are gathered in the hall discussing your first
“rack date.” In the ‘Tales of the Hall’ you find
yourself either bragging and boasting about your ex-
ploits, or feigning nobleness and a sense of honor,
knowing all the while that it is all BS.

But it is really fruitless for you to be told all this. It
all sounds very interesting, but you are probably pret-
ty skeptical about all of the above happening. Even
though there is a 95% chance that you considered
yourself a high school stud, after this weekend many
of you will feel like you have been put out to pasture.
Good luck! Experience is the best teacher, and after
this weekend you will be a W&L man one way or
another. :

A closing note to those of you have been set up with
“blind” dates by well-intentioned upperclassmen.
Your date has been described to you as either a nice
girl or a good girl. Sometimes this can be misleading,
especially if this is your first blind date. You can
never really be sure, but a 16th century poet has given
us perhaps the best criteria for judging the quality of
your date: ‘‘Nice Girls go out, go home, and go to bed;
good girls go out, go to bed, and go home.”’

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry

Saturday, Oct. 1, 1977
Editor, Ring-tum Phi

Ther were some delightful
pictures of some young ladies in
the Phi last week just delightful
and why were they in there they
were there to remind us what
girls look like because we
hadn’t seen any since the last
weelend and we weren't destin-
ed to see any since the until the
upcoming weekend and why is
all this true because the nearest
female college students except
B.V.ers go to school thirty five
miles away with most young
ladies forty five miles away
now that makes sense doesn’t it
fourteen hundred young men
here who merely have to travel
forty five miles over wonderful
mountain roads to talk to a
young woman unless they want
to pay a dime every minute for
a long distance voice without a
face and why do we do this well
it’s all very logical back in 1749
some men founded a school for
their genedr of their species and
as we all know what’s good
enough for 1749 you know when
we were all British subjects is
good enough for 1977 and
whoever those commies were
who broke away from his ma-
jesty George III; well those
pinko fags should have been ex-
terminated anyway those 2,900
schools that have enrolled
females ought to be ashamed
thank goodness there are still
sixteen colleges around that
realize the importance of keep-
ing the less intelligent sex out of
higher education what mix the
seses to provide an environ-
ment that more. closely
resembles the “real world’
what blasphemy what sacrilege
who ever said college is suppos-
ed to prepare students for life
there is no such thing as a
woman who lives during the
week they only exist on
weekends because I’ve never
seen a girl during the week
what wearing sloppy clothes
like men impossible and
without makeup it couldn't be
so don’t tell me about girls I’ve
seen them they're all pretty and
they all wear nice skirts and
blouses or fancy slacks girls

don’t wear jeans and their hair
is always neatly combed that’s
what girls look like and they
don’t know anything about
politics philosophy biology
Spanish mathematics
psychology economics
chemistry music english or
anything like that they just go to
parties and say college is a lear-
ning experience well, that’s
what I’ve learned that all
makes sense to you doesn’t it
this is a very cosmopolitan
school after we eliminate the
less important fifty per cent of
the population yearh that
makes sense that makes sense
that makes sense well thanks
again for the pictures my
memory needed a refreshment i
had almost forgotten. Palmore

Clarke, ‘80.

Dear Mr. Editor,

It was with great.dismay that
I read your editorial of
September 29, concerning the
football team. For someone who
couldn’t hack it himself on the
W&L football field, you seem to
be quite an authority on the pro-
blems of the 1977 squad. If you
have come to expect a loser,
then I would say you are a loser
yourself. We have eight games
left this year with a good chance
for a winning season.

 

As for myself, I take a lot of
pride in playing for Washington
and Lee. Win or lose, we get
“dumped on’’ a lot because of
the winning teams around us. I
can safely say that the entire
team has a great deal of con-
fidence in our coaching staff.
They are under pressure each
week, trying to get us prepared
for a team that is usually bigger
and faster. Each game we win
is a tribute to them. You must
remember that it is the players
on the field who lose, not the
coaches. If anyone is to blame
for our poor performance to
date, we are. It could be said
that my opinion is not objective
enough because I am on the
team, but I hope you will print
this, as my sentiments are
shared by all of my teammates
and many other friends.

Maybe all of us should quit
and become feature writers for
the Ring-tum Phi like J.M.G!

Don Crosley, ‘79
Editor:

There appeared to be a great
deal of response to Dan Beyer’s
letter in last week’s issue. The

one very important point about

‘Murph
Reports”

A number of W&L students
have been victims of theft dur-
ing the first three weeks of
school.

Charles Murphy, University
Proctor, said that four or five
wallets have been reported lost
or stolen at Wilson Field. In ad-
dition, about six wallets have
disappeared from the freshmen
dorms. Murphy said that one
freshman reported losing or
having a wallet stolen with $160
in it. Also, a tapedeck was taken
from “The Corrall,” the park-
ing lot opposite the Phi Kappa
Sigma House.

There have been a number of
parking tickets written out.
Murphy said that this was
almost inevitable, for there are
just not enough parking places
around campus for students,
faculty and staff. There are 983
cars registered among the stu-
dent body alone.

jamin Britten. Spirituals and
traditional W&L songs, as well
as a medley from Rogers and
Hammerstein’s ‘‘Oklahoma,”’
are to be used in the concerts.
The trip to Mexico is planned
for April 8-16, between the
Winter and Spring semesters.
The trip’s itinerary includes
concerts in Mexico City and
Cuernavaca and vacationing in
Acapulco. Some of the funding
comes from sales of the record
“Songs Of W&L,’’ which can be
found in the campus record
shop. Additionally, they will
raise money by raffling off a
trip to Mexico City and
Ac

  

of weeks to replace the school’s
dated F30. This computer will
be temporarily located in the
basement of Tucker Hall. The
old Tucker library will be
restructured to become the per-
manent home of the computer
center. This work will be exten-
sive because of the reengineer-
ing required to the electrical,
vent and air-conditioning
systems. Upon completion and
move of the computer center to
the first floor, the basement will
be remodeled and will become
the future quarters of the
Psychology department.

Henry Ravenhorst, professor
and architect for the Tucker
Hall and most likely for future
work, will try to match the in-
terior design to the age of the
building. Parsons felt, ‘We will
try to also keep the open feeling
of the building, for example, in
the computer center. We will
try and take advantage of this
beautiful large room while at
the same time provide
separate..and secure spaces.’’

Future planning includes
making McCormack Library,
the future home of an expanded
Commerce School. Newcomb
Hall will then open up to take in
the History, Sociology and
Religion departments.

Music Course
In Winter

A music appreciation course
in bluegrass music will be of-
fered winter term for no credit.
The course will meet on a one
hour a week basis for the fu'l
twelve week term. It will in-
volve individual instruction (on
guitar and possibly banjo, fid-
dle, mandolin, dobro and bass)
and discussion of the history of
bluegrass music, as it has
evolved from ‘‘old time’’ until
now.

The course will be taught by
Burr Datz, who played with
local bluegrass musicians while
he was a student and who has
worked with various bluegrass
bands in New York for the past
two years. Datz has set forth
three major objectives for the
course. Students should develop
an appreciation for bluegrass,
learn to identify different musi-
cians by their styles, and learn
or further an ability to play a
bluegrass instrument. Em-
phasis in this last objective is
placed on reading tablature.
Each bluegrass instrument will
be covered separately, and the
individual styles of certain
musicians will be covered. One
textbook will be needed for the
course, ‘‘Bluegrass”’ by Bob Ar-
tis, and each interested student
will need two sixty minute tapes
(cassette) for the course. The
tapes will be used for class pur-
poses and may be kept by the
students.

All interested students should
contact Burr Datz in Evans Din-
ing Hall or sign up outside of Dr.
Stewart’s office in McCormick
Library. There will be no
charge to the students other
than for the text and tapes.

coach. When asked if he had
confidence in the coaching
staff, Thompson refused to
comment except to say that he
agreed with the editorial in last
week'sRing-tum Phi (the
coaching staff for indecision
and its disorganization).

Thompson said when he
realized that he was beginning
to question the coaching deci-
sions and lose his respect for the
staff, coupled with the coaches
broken promises to him, he
decided that he no longer had a
legitimate right to stay on the
team. During his career,
Thompson has kicked 25 PAT’s
and 9 field goals. When con-
tacted late Tuesday night,
McHenry declined to comment
on the matter.

Rush

(continued from page 3)

however, share a greatly dif-
ferent viewpoint. Many
brothers questioned said they
felt that this year’s freshmen,
as a whole, are calmer, and

perhaps, more apathetic about
choosing fraternities than past
freshmen. Many of the more
‘“stereotyped”’ fraternities are
also finding it difficult to find
people who fit their images. As
one fraternity member sated,
quite bluntly, ‘‘We didn’t get
nearly the amount of cream-of-
the-crop guys in here that we
expected.”

Perhaps the most ignored, yet
most influential group which
has had a bearing upon rush
this year has been the IFC. Two
major actions taken by the
group this year appear to have
greatly affected rush: first, the
aforementioned admonition to
freshmen at orientation not to
make fraternity choices hur-
riedly appears to have influenc-
ed many to make more careful
considerations. Second, strict
rush rule enforecement has
prevented some houses from
practicing illegal rush tactics
which had previously brought in
pledges (i.e. — In past years,
some houses have _ plied
freshmen with liquor during
rush dates — a rule violation —
and then high-pressured these
freshmen into pledging). In any
case, this year’s IFC actions
have better prepared the
freshmen for rush and forced
fraternities to adhere to rush
rules.

Whatever the causes of this
year’s lackluster rush, several
conclusions may be drawn.
First, this year’s freshmen
were, aS a_ group, better
prepared to go through rush
than any class in_ recent
history ; second, fraternities are
having a difficult time finding
freshmen who conform to their
standards for membership; and
third, the IFC has made it
harder for fraternities to
employ dubious tactics in
building pledge classes. If this
trend repeats itself in years to
come, fraternities may have to
re-examine their ideals or suf-
fer smaller-than-usual pledge
classes. As for this year,
though, it appears that rush and
fraternity life are in a transi-
tional stage which may lead to
important re-evaluations in
many houses.

EC Votes On Budget Requests

tion the E.C. will give the SAB
$2,000 to buy new projector
equipment.

The SAB was not the only
organization to see its proposed
budget slashed from $7,500 to
$6,100, almost a 20 per cent cut.
It appears as though there is
sentiment on the E.C., however,
to give Contact some more
money. Contact needs more
money to put on a worthwhile
program, said senior E.C.
representative Mike Missal.
The problem is going to be find-
ing sources for that money.

One of the sources, as in-
dicated .by senior E.C.
representative Doug Perkins,
may be Ariel, the student
literary magazine. Perkins
commented that Ariel had only
been able to put out one issue
last year, and he thought that
was enough. As it was Ariel’s
budget was cut from a proposed
$1,200 to $950, more than a 20
percent cut. Peer, Perkins said
he would propose to cut Ariel’s
budget down to $475 next week.

The Ring-tum Phi’s budget
was given a preliminary cut of
$500, despite the fact that the
Phi asked for almost $1,000 less
than last year. It was the only
organization that asked for less
money this year than it got last
year. Business Manager Pete
Goss protested the cut of the
Phi’s budget from $3,000 to
$2,500., saying that he had
‘‘gone out on a limb’’ to propose
such a low budget. He said that
when he figured the budget he
had tried to be optimistic on
both the amount of advertising
he could get and on the cost of
getting out each issue.

Goss said he had figured on

167s. Main MARKET

We Give S&H Green Stamps
(We Welcome Student Charge Accounts)

(continued from page 1)

each issue costing $365 to put
out, although each issue could
cost as much as $425. In addi-
tion, he said the projected two
pages of advertisements could
be too high. Goss threatened to
return the Phi to its original
eight page format if he found
the cuts were intolerable.

Goss seemed to lose a lot of
support when he told the E.C.
that last year’s business
manager Dave McLean earned
approximately $490 and last
year’s editor, Robert D. Lutz,
earned about $450. E.C.
members were shocked at the
amount of money the Publica-
tions Board gave McLean and
Lutz for salaries. Jim
Underhill, E.C. president, said
he thought there was a fixed
salary of $150. Goss said the
business manager receives $200
plus 25 percent of the profits
made by the paper, while the
editor receives $150 plus 20 per-
cent of the profits.

Rick Goddard figured out that
that meant the Phi made $1,300
in profits last year, and re-
quested the E.C. take $1,300
from the Phi and give it to the
law school. Compromise
brought the figure down to $500.

The law school had $1,440
trimmed from its request, but
still got $2,500 more than it
received last year. The law
school requested $11,500 and is
tentatively scheduled to get
$10,060. They were indications
at the meeting, however, that
this figure may go up. Student
Bar Association President Ray
Leven was adamant that the
principle of funding the law
school be ‘“‘getting our fair
share.’’ He said the law school

was ‘“‘underfunded last year
because of the new building.”

Both he and Goddard said
they strongly believe that the
law school get back 95 percent
of the money it contributes to
the student fund. They also sug-
gested, because the law school
is in session more than three
weeks before the E.C. first
meets that all the money col-
lected at matriculation for stu-
dent activity fees be given
directly to the law school, and
then the E.C. could tax away
‘between 5 and 7 percent” of
the monies as soon as possible,
but declined to set a policy
stipulating that the law school
should get 95 percent of its
funds back directly.

The Calyx’s budget was only
cut by $200, from $9,200 to
$9,000. The Mock Convention
got its requested $300 for
operating expenses, although it
wanted more to avoid a $5 rise
in the student activity fee in
1980, which is sure to come now.

In addition, the E.C. ap-
propriated $2,000 for itself for
operating expenses, laid away
$3,600 for further E.C. funding
requests and put aside $1,540 for
the Student Body Reserve
Fund, a fund used for bailing
out organizations in financial
trouble.

In other action, the E.C.
elected Robert Sundberg to the
faculty E.C., Robert Atkinson
and John Strong to the Commit-
tee on Courses and Degrees,
Fred Brimberg to the Library
Advisory Committee and Mark
Bennett, Mark Derbyshire and
Derrick Swope to the Athletic
Committee.

 

Competition for

grants closing

The 1978-79 competition for
grants for graduate study
abroad offered under the
Mutual Educational Exchange
Program (Fulbright-Hays) and
by foreign governments,
universities and private donors
will close shortly. Only a few
more weeks remain in which
qualified graduate students
may apply for one of the 550
awards which are available to
53 countries.

Most of the grants offered
provide round-trip transporta-
tion, tuition and maintenance
for one academic year; a few
provide international travel on-
ly or a stipend intended as a
partial grant-in-aid.

Candidates must be U. S.
citizens at the time of applica-
tion, hold a bachelor’s degree or
its equivalent by the beginning
date of the grant, have
language ability commensurate
with the demands of the propos-
ed study projects, and good
health.

Survey

essay question which also ap-
peared on the form. (In general,
the question concerned what
improvements or changes could
be made to the honor system
itself or on the application and
enforcement of it). However,
some law students who respond-
ed felt there wasn’t enough
orientation to the honor system.
They never obtained the
benefits (what few there were)
of Natural Bridge, and only one
speaker was sent there last
year to discuss the honor
system according to Underhill.
Common replies of both the law
school and the university were
for stronger action by the E.C.
concerning honor violations
said Underhill and Griffin.

Some students answered that
W&L pupils must be trusted
completely or not at all. As
Underhill put it, the test of the
honor system is not the rules
themselves, but how the
students and the school obey it
and enforce it. It appears the
students are solidly behind the
honor system, at least in princi-
ple.

“If necessary, we will arrest
the fraternity’s president or

feel that he is most responsible
for his house’s_behavior,”’
Hamilton said. “‘All I can say is
that I hope the houses have
enough sense to respect the

Although they haven’t taken
an issue on the stand as of yet,
the Inter-Fraternity Council
will probably start levying fines

Last year, a fraternity was
placed on social probation for
making excessive noise and for

taking part in a bottle throwing

“I hope the fraternities will

this year, the local councilmen
have complained about loud

Dean John also attributed the

many fraternities seems to be
in holding parties on Wednes-
day nights. The local people
may be tolerant of weekend
noise but it is an entirely dif-
ferent situation, when houses

A number of fraternities com-
plain that the police have been
unreasonably strict in enforcing
the ordinance. Several houses
claimed that they were told to
turn off their stereo systems
during afternoon parties when
the rule is not in effect. Other
houses accused neighboring
fraternities of making the com-
plaints themselves as a means
of dirty rush.

ideologies and beliefs; but in-
stead of looking at this as a
weakness, a course for fac-
tionalism, we look at it as a sign
of strength.

RtP: Many wonder, what is the
ideology of the Young
Democrats?

Cave: Basically, the average
member of the W&L YD’s is,
like the average student at
W&L, conservative. Although, I
do not think the average YD is
nearly as conservative as is the
average College Republican.
We are far from being anything
but a moderate political
organization.

RtP: Could you outline some of
your basic plans or objectives
for the year.

Cave: The club plans to have a
fairly impressive speakers’ pro-
gram which should include
several Congressmen and at
least one governor. We also
hope to hold several seminars
or workshops, such as the one
that is planned for the
December meeting, which will
deal with the pros and cons of
the Equal Rights Amendment.

Further club plans include
social activities with area
clubs, such as UVa. and the
establishment of YD clubs at
the area schools, which do not
now have them. They are
preparing for a weekend trip to
D. C. and expect to have an end-
of-the-year banquet. In the area
of legislative affairs, they pro-
pose to lobby for the
decriminalization of mari-
juana.

As it stands now, former Presi-
dent Ben Winn’s prediction of
last year, ‘I think we’re going
to be a growing club,” seems to
bea reality.

EC asks for more money,

Washington and Lee University’s Weekly Newspaper

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, OCTOBER 13, 1977

Ariel suffers cutbacks

by Lee Howard

Because of the very tight
budget situation this year, the
Executive Committee voted 7-3
Monday night to request that
the Board of Trustees raise the
student activity fee by $5 per
term next year.

‘Very few organizations were
satisfied with the final budget
allotments decided on by the
Executive Committee Monday,
but all could be thankful for at
least one thing; the long, gruel-
ing sessions are finally over.

After sessions of 12, 34% and
114 hours three weeks in succes-
sion, Ariel, the student literary
magazine, was probably the
most dissatisfied organization.
After requesting a budget of
$1,200, Ariel’s editor Parker
Potter saw his request cut first
to $950 and then to $500. This
will mean that, instead of being
assured of having enough
money for two issues, the Ariel
will have to come back to the
E.C. and ask for extra money if
it finds itself in the position of
being able to put out another
one, E. C. preident Jim
Underhill said.

Underhill and several other
E.C. members were not op-
timistic that the Ariel could put
out two issues. The based their
opinions on the fact that Ariel

has only been able to put out one
issue per year for the last two
years. Potter, however, insisted
that he could put out two issues,
but said he needed to plan on the
E.C. money.

Mike Missal, senior E.C.
representative, was the most
vocal supporter of Ariel, saying
that Ariel needed a guaranteed
amount of money much more
than Contact, the organization
which was to gain the money
Ariel lost. He said that the Inter
Fraternity Council may be able
to give Contact more money
than it gave last year. Steve
Jones, IFC secretary, confirm-
ed that the organization would
probably be able to give Contact
more money but said he wasn’t
sure how much more it
would be able to give. He said
he couldn’t assure the E.C. it
would be as much as $450.

Jack Bovay, junior E.C.
representative, made the mo-
tion to take $450 away from
Ariel and give it to Contact. The
motion passed 7-3. Missal, E.C.
secretary Neil Pentifallo, and
vice president George Criffin
were the dissenters.

Another organization which
was dissatisfied with its final
budget was the Student Ac-
tivities Board. Although no ad-
ditional money was taken from
the SAB at Monday’s meeting,

Henry Howell, democratic
candidate for governor, visited
Lexington Friday in an effort,
as he said in a press conference
later, to go ‘‘to the people to
stop the untruths spread about
Henry Howell.”’

Howell, speaking at a press
conference in Washington and
Lee’s Fairfax Lounge, was the
victim of a letter sent by Rep. J.
Kenneth Robinson, R-Va.,
which inaccurately stated
Iseveral of Howell’s stands.
Howell said that his enemies did
this in an effort to ‘‘attach fears
in people’s minds to the can-
didate they want to defeat.’’
When asked whether he thought
republican gubernatiorial can-
didate John N. Dalton was
responsible for the mailings, he
said Dalton and Robinson are
‘good republican  friends.’’
Howell added, ‘‘The mail is to

idefeat me and elect him,”’

Smear Tactics

Howell called the mail cam-
paign ‘“‘The most costly direct
mail campaign in the history of
Virginia.’’ He added, “‘I do not
have the money to fight direct
mail.” It is the most expensive
and effective way of garnering
votes,” he said.

On the issue of Dalton’s
“feathering his nest’? by in-
troducing banking legislation,
which favored a bank in Rad-
ford in which Dalton has
$265,000 worth of shares; all
Howell would say was
‘‘Bankers shouldn’t put in bank-
ing legislation.’’ He said he
believes this is a conflict of in-
terest.

Howell also attacked the “I
per cent who control a large
amount of economic factors.”’
He particularly criticized those
who own interests in utility
companies, saying that the fuel
adjustment clause subsidizes
mismanagement by the
utilities. In every other com-

Police raid fraternities

by Randy Smith

Two Washington and Lee
frateenity presidents were
taken to Lexington police head-
quarters by city police late
Saturday night, and issued writ-
ten summonses for violation of
the city’s noise ordinance.

Lexington police visited
Sigma Phi Epsilon and Phi
Gamma Delta fraternities, both
on Preston Street, in response
to neighbor complaints about
excessively loud music
emanating from bands the
fraternity houses had hired for
Homecoming weekend. Subse-
quent to the police visits, bet-
ween 11 p.m. and midnight,
both fraternity presidents were
issued summonses to appear in
court on October 18 for violation
of a city ordinance (15-32, Sec-
tion B) which forbids noise
more than 50 feet from its point
of origin between the hours of 11
p.m. and 7 a.m. Violation of the
ordinance can carry a penalty
of up to $1,000 and/or one year
in jail.

Lexington Police Chief James
A. Kirby, in an interview Mon-
day, reiterated that ‘‘we’ve
been going to the fraternities,
asking them to turn the noise
down,”’ but with little apparent

With the Blueridge coun-
tryside swooning in the brisk In-

favorite fraternity or social

ing Queen, faced a hectic Fri-
day afternoon of introductions,
interrogations, and dining in
their hot pursuit of the highest

sity to any young lady. First,

success. In Chief Kirby’s eyes,
the police department has done
“everything possible” to main-
tain good relations with the
students, “‘but when the (City)
Council passes an ordinance, it
is our duty to see it’s enforced.”’

Chief Kirby refused this
reporter’s request for the
names of the fraternity
presidents issued the sum-
monses, citing the “Privacy
Security Act.’’ He did, however,
give the approximate location
of the fraternity houses by
disclosing the streets where the
noise complaints originated,
and some Post Office box
numbers. (Section 261.23h of the
Postal Service Manual forbids
the disclosure of a boxholder’s
name, address, and telephone
number by Postal workers “‘ex-
cept for law enforcement pur-
poses”’ or “‘in response to a sub-
poena or court order.’’)

The presidents of the only two
fraternities on Preston Street,
one of the streets cited by Chief
Kirby, readily admitted that
they had been issued sum-
monses Saturday night, and
agreed to interviews with the
Ring-tum Phi.

Phi Gamma Delta president,
Charlie Brown, related that
Lexington police came by the

steadied in varying degrees by
their escorts, had cocktails and
met the selection committee of
Carolle Chappel, Mrs. Miller,
and professors Schillington,
Dobbs, and Stevenson.

The girls, just beginning to
gear up for the imminent for-
mality, combined, in some
cases, the social grace in-
dicative of refined young ladies
with the candid humour of pre-
sent day coeds. One Sweet Briar
lass, using the eloquence of a

Fiji house shortly after 11:00
p.m. and gave him a warning
that the music was too loud. ‘‘So
I went ahead and asked the
band to turn down their music,
which they did. Then, at ap-
proximately 11:45 p.m., a se-
cond officer arrived and told me
the music was too loud and I
was going to get a summons.”
He was taken down to police
headquarters and issued a writ-
ten summons to appear in court
for violation of ordinance 15-32,
Section B.

While down at the sta-
tionhouse, Brown was told that
if the officers had to return to
Fiji, the band’s equipment
would be confiscated and he
would be put in jail for the
night. Mindful of the threatened
consequences, the band ceased
playing for the evening.

Just prior the action against
Fiji, Lexington police had taken
Mark Danos, president of
Sigma Phi Epsilon, down to
headquarters for his summons
to court. According to Danos’
account, he had not been warn-
ed about SPE’s band being too:
loud before he received his sum-
mons. ‘“‘We were warned about
excessive noise once before
Saturday night, and that was a

pseudo-top-drawer accent,
snapped in a fit of apparent sar-
casm, ‘I don’t know how much
longer I can put up with this lit-
tle girl stuff,’ while a future
princess admitted openly that
she was extremely nervous.

After the introductory
cocktails, each contestant spent
15 minutes answering in
privacy, the general questions
of the five judges. When the last
nominee had answered the final
question, the whole group,
escorts, competitors, and
judges went out to dinner at the
treat of the college. .This dinner
table situation gave the selec-
tion committee one last op-
portunity to examine and select
the Queen and her two
princesses whom they. would
present to the next day
homecoming halftime crowd of
admiring undergrads and
nostalgic alumni.

On the fateful morning, amid
the frenetic last minute
preparations of the contestants,
torential downpours saturated
Lexington. At halftime, as the
rain begain to wane, with eigh-

teen delicately set hairdoos and
the football game given up for
lost, the faithful homecoming

verbal warning on September
30th.”’

When Danos returned from
police headquarters, the SPE
party was back into “‘full sw-
ing.’’ But the Lexington police
returned at 12:45 and told
Danos, as they told Brown, that
the band’s equipment would be
confiscated unless they stopped
playing immediately. Ap-
parently even the absence of a
band did not stop the party at
SPE, which repartedly con-
tinued until “‘the early hours of
the morning.”’

When asked for his reactio-
nand thoughts on the future im-
plications of Saturday night’s
police action, Fiji president
Charlie Brown said that he
hopes some sort of compromise
can be worked out with City of-
ficials ‘because fraternities
can’t function without partying
on Friday and Saturday
nights—especially on
Homecoming weekend. I can
understand complaints occurr-
ing during the week, but an
11:00 p.m. curfew on Friday
and Saturday is just too restric-
ting.”’

“However, ‘‘ Brown added,
“if nothing can be worked out,
then I can foresee many pro-
blems arising. To limit Friday
and Saturday night activities at
fraternities would be disastrous
for W&L.”’

Mark Danos sees a direct con-
flict between the noise or-
dinance and fraternity parties.
‘It is ridiculous to think that the
police can end a party at 11:00
p.m. The decision to all of a sud-
den enforce this ordinance after
SO Many years is puzzling, to
say the least. Did the police
honestly believe our house
(SPE) had any reason to think
that a band party, which has
been acceptable in past years,
would result in the summonzing
of the president?”

Danos believes Washington
and Lee officials should meet
with the City Council ‘‘and
straighten this ordinance mess
up. The fraternities are suffer-
ing for the sudden whim to en-
force this ordinance. Something
must be done, and it must come
trom President Huntley and the
University administration.”’

On the same night, Phi Kappa
Psi was given a warning about
the loudness of their band’s
music, but no summons was
issued. According to fraternity
members, a policeman heard
their party from the police
parking lot across the street,
and issued the warning on that
basis. The turned down the
musi¢e and received no further
visits.

Developments Since Monday

When Interfraternity Council
president Steve Mattesky heard
about’ the summonzing of
Brown and Danos, he was
understandably disturbed about
the incident. He immediately
gathered the pertinent facts and
met with University ad-
ministrators to consider
various plans of actions. A
meeting was arranged between
City and University officials for
Tuesday afternoon to discuss
the noise problem.

Prior to Tuesday’s meeting,
Dean of Students Lewis G.
John, was hopeful that ‘some
sort of understanding or agree-
ment”’ could be reached with Ci-
ty officials so that future com-
plaints of excessive noise com-
ing from fraternities could be
handled “through University
channels.”’ Dean John pointed

out that ‘‘constant noise
throughout the week’’ had made
Lexington residents ‘‘less

tolerant on the weekends,” and
that the police were merely
responding to registered com-
plaints. He hoped a compromise
between the IFC request (of
1:00 a.m. cut-off time) and the
City ordinance (11:00 p.m.)
could be reached. ‘‘The way the
ordinance is enforced is just as
important as what’s on the
books.”’

But all hope for a compromise
was seemingly lost by Tuesday
evening. At the IFC meeting
that night, Steve Mattesky
outlined the results of that
afternoon’s meeting between
Police Chief Lirby, Lexinton
Mayor Phelps, City Manager
Doan, Dean Murphy, Dean
John, and the IFC president.
Out of that afternoon meeting
came the word that the or-
dinance would be _ enforced

strictly, and that town senti-
ment, apparently, strongly sup-
ports its enforcement.

A listing of 25 citizen com-,

plaints about excessive frater-
nity noise, filed at police head-
quarters, was given to Mat-
tesky. Complaints were receiv-
ed at varying hours of the day,
and for every day of the week.
Mattesky was warned that the
citizens of Lexington would no
longer be tolerant of fraternity
abuses. ‘“‘The University, for
the time being, is not in a
negotiating position with the Ci-
ty’s administration.”

Because of this apparent
animosity between the frater-
nities and the town’s people,
Mattesky emphasized that the
fraternities would have to
‘“‘prove themselves responsi-
ble,’ and show their ‘good
faith”’ to the city. As a means of
reinforcing the image of respon-
sibility, the IFC president warn-
ed that fraternities reported
making noise after the city’s
prescribed time limit would be
subject to possible social proba-
tion as well as legal actions
taken by city officials ‘‘to pro-
tect’’ those fraternities not
usually in conflict with city or-
dinances.

Guitarist Opens
Guild Season

The Washington and Lee
University Concert Guild opens
its season Oct. 18 with a per-
formance by Peter Corey, a 19-
year-old classical guitarist.

The Guild will sponsor five
other concerts during the
1977-78 season: the Performers’
Committee for 20th-Century
Music (Oct. 31); the Clarion
Wind Quintet (Nov. 17);
William McCorkle and Walter
Chestnut, organ and trumpet,
assisted by the Rockbridge Or-
chestra (Jan. 22); the Theater
Chamber Players (Feb. 21),
and Richard Collins, pianist
(March 20).

Peter Corey is the youngest
artis ever to win a Concert Ar-
tists Guild Award. He began
playing the quitar when he was
six and made his first public ap-
pearance at the age of 13. He
has performed at the Delaware

Water Gap Festival, Sarah
Lawrence College. Fairleigh
Dickinson University and in

Madrid and New York City.

The Performers’ Committee
was formed tn 1967 with the goal

MEN'S STYLING AT

of expanding the audience for
this century's music. It has per-
formed in Lincoln Center, Ken-
nedy Center and other major
concert halls. The group will
present compositions of

Chi Psi a “Gentleman’s Fraternity”

by Galen Trussell

Chi Psi, the newest of
Washington and Lee’s fraternal
orders, will have a house for its
sophomores to live in by next
year.

Peter Keefe, President of the
Chi Psis, said that the fraternity
will either buy or build a house
so its members will have a
structure to live in during the
1978-79 school year.

Sources around campus
claim that the budding fraterni-
ty has received a $250,000 grant
from the national. Keefe refus-
ed to be tied down to a specific
figure, but said resources were
available to start looking for a
house immediately.

The Chi Psi national was first
contacted about establishing a
chapter at Washington and Lee
by Dean Lewis John. After
discerning there was enough
alumni support in this area to
warrant a chapter at
Washington and Lee, the na-
tional went ahead with plans.
The first members of Chi Psi at
Washington and Lee were in-
itiated into the national in
February, and the fraternity
was officially recognized by the
IFC last spring.

Keefe acknowledged not hav-
ing a house to rush out of was a
definite handicap during rush.
He said Chi Psi held its first and
second rush dates at the Alex-
ander Withrow House. During
the second rush date, however,
the Chi Psis were told to leave
because they were making too
much moise. Consequently, the
rest of the fraternity’s rush
dates had to be held in a
member’s apartment on Ran-
dolph Street.

Keefe felt the eviction didn’t
really hurt the Chi Psi rush
because the frat got six pledges
while giving only eight bids.
Overall, the frat will have 11 ac-
tive members next fall.

In the Cockpit:

 

As for finding a house, Keefe
admitted the going has not been
all smooth. The frat’s first
choice was Belfield House,
vacated after Deal Gillam’s
death. However, Chi Psi could
not get the house because of
zoning restrictions. A house on
Jackson Street was the fraterni-
ty’s second choice, but the
house was sold before the na-
tional president could come to
Lexington and inspect it. Keefe
said he has_ several local
realtors looking for a structure,
but as of now there are no
strong possibilities.

Nationally, Chi Psi fancies
itself a gentleman’s fraternity,
according to Keefe. Keefe add-
ed the national places strong
importance on elegant houses
and strong academics. The na-

tional even goes so far as to re-
quire each chapter to have a
special study room which com-
plies with national specifica-
tions. According to Keefe, Chi
Psi has the largest scholarship
funds of any national fraternity,
offering outstanding members
internship and advanced educa-
tional opportunities.

As for the future plans of
W&L’s Chi Psi chapter, Keefe
said the house would like to
maintain a full social calendar.
Keefe also stressed his desire to
see the chapter involve itself in
community service.

Keefe, above all, wished to
stress his thanks to the KA’s
and the national for the help and
encouragement they have given
to the W&L Chi Psis.

Frosh politicians
prepare for elections

by Kevin Dwyer

Nineteen freshmen have filed
petitions for class office and Ex-
ecutive Committee represen-
tative. Eight are vying for the
position of E.C. freshman rep. :
Chip Hughes, Tom Bartlett,
Steve Swallow, Chris Gammon,
Joe Sloboda, Jeff Christovich,
Robert Brooke and Mike J. Far-
rand.

Several issues appear certain
to surface in this particular
race. Many freshmen are con-
cerned about the honor system
and its attendants-including in-
dependent exams. Some feel
that there is too much im-
portance placed on the viola-
tions. Jeff Christovich, one of
the candidates for E.C. feels
that ‘‘too many freshmen have
too little respect for the E.C.
because it continually em-
phasizes the negative-honor
violations, and neglects the
positive-projects for students.”’

At its Monday meeting, the
current Executive Committee
set several limits on the ongoing
campaigns. The initial require-
ment was that each potential

Fat Meat Boys
bring “Road” here

by Dan Scott

The management of the
Cockpit in its ongoing effort to
‘bring the road”’ to Washington
and Lee, has booked ‘Ace
Weems and the Fat Meat Boys”
to play this Saturday, Oct. 15 at
8:00. When asked to define ex-
actly what “bringing the road”’
to W&L means, Cockpit night
manager Dan Scott replied,
‘Who the hell wants to drive 50
miles in his search for female
companionshipWouldn’t it be
great to walk across the street
to the University Center and
find what you are looking for on
a Friday or Saturday night
lounging around the Cockpit?
Also, when a girl comes to W&L

on a weekend night, or any,

night for that matter, just

where can she go in Lexington
knowing she’s going to meet
people and be entertained? We
want the Cockpit to become a
center of contact for the student
body and for the surrounding
girl’s schools. We want it to be a
place where every student on
campus will know he can come
in and have a good time—just
about every night of the week.
That’s why we are determined
to get good entertainment in
here every Wednesday, Friday,
and Saturday at least.”

When asked about this Satur-
day’s entertainment, Scott said,
‘**Ace Weems and the Fat Meat
Boys’ kick. The guys in the
group just have a real good time
performing. It rubs off on
everyone in the audience.”

candidate obtain 50 signatures
from members of his class.
Campaign spending has been
limited to $7.50, and each can-
didate is limited to one banner
and 20 campaign posters. ©

The Presidency of the
freshman class is open also, and
eight have entered this race as
well: J. Scott Cardozo, Jamie
Small, Raymond Best, Dutch
Waldbauer, Marc Firestone,
John Schmidt, Peter Eliades
and Sam Campbell. The
primary responsibility of the
class president is to represent
the class on the Student Control
Committee. He also organizes
the class parties.

One candidate, Marc
Firestone, may have gotten a
jump on the others by throwing
an “‘imported-beer”’ party in his
room Homecoming night.
Firestone believes in freshman
self-discipline and in taking a
firm stand against honor viola-
tions.

The interest in the office of
vice president is somewhat
less; there are three can-
didates: Robert Neely, Joe
Robles and Bob H. Willis. Says
Willis, ‘‘I think class solidarity
is essential, and I honestly feel
that I can and will work hard to
pull this class together, so that
despite necessary diversity, we
feel united.”’

The other candidates could
not be reached for their com-
ments.

Posters and banners have
begun appearing throughout the
Quad and in the lawn area in
front of Davis and Gilliam. The
election will be Monday, Oct. 17.

Howell Visits W&L

(continued from page 1)

pany stockholders are responsi-
ble for mismanagement, but not
in the utilities, he said. When
asked why broker firms such as
Merrill-Lynch believe that
Virginia utilities are a bad in-
vestment because of the high
risk relative to the rate of
return, Howell said he believes
there is no risk and that a 12 per
cent rate of return is ‘‘more
than adequate”’ despite the fair
return being listed at ‘“‘between
13 and 14 per cent.”’

Howell said he would try to
prevent another gasoline shor-
tage, such as the one which hit
Virginia last year, by having a
“‘tie-in”’ for energy predictions.
He said he would make sure
beforehand that he knew where
supplies could be found in the
event of a shortage. He said that
if, for some reason, he was
unable to predict the shortage,
he would expect to have “‘ins-
tant contact” with the utilities
to resolve the situation.

Howell, when asked to com-
ment on Dalton’s statement
that the would turn Virginia into
the “energy capitol of the
world,’ said that was a ‘‘cam-
paign dream.” He said Virginia
could not hope to compete with
Texas in the number of oil wells
and that Virginia would not
want to give up on one of its
most important industries,
tourism. He said that the state

has tough environmental stan-
dards, with good cause. He said
in an attempt to industrialize,
States often lose their natural
industries. He cited the exam-
ple of the James River, which
became so polluted with kepone
that it wiped out fishing in that
area. He called this ‘‘one of the
great industrial tragedies in the
history of the United States.”

Howell said Dalton has shown
‘no consumer interest.’ He
said Dalton favors both the
automatic fuel adjustment
clause and deregulating the
price of gasoline. Both would
send the price of energy out of
sight, he said.

Howell excused himself after
the short 20 minute press con-
ference, saying he must move
on; there was a lot more cam-
paigning to do. He took time out
to shake the hand of professor
Milton Colvin, who had been his
oppenent in a _ democratic
primary for state senator. Col-
vin is a politics professor at
W&L.

After shaking a few more
hands he boarded his huge red,
white and blue ‘‘campaign on
wheels”’ vehicle. In the true
populist style he was ready to
move on to another small town
in Virginia to talk ‘‘to the peo-
ple.”

Washington and Lee’s Cross
Country team traveled to Lyn-

chburg while soundly defeating
Norfolk State. Virginia
Wesleyan was to be the fourth
opponent in a_ schelduled
quadrangular meet but failed to

Generals.

Lynchburg College won the
meet with a score of 25 points.
The Hornets were paced by
Dave Taylor, who finished first
with a time of 27 minutes 20

was a close second to Lyn-
chburg with a point total of 32.
Richard Bird finished third
overall and first for the

Lexington got a chance to see
intercollegiate water polo for
the first time last weekend as
W&L hosted a Southern League

Undefeated In ODAC

The Generals maintained
their unbeaten record in the
ODAC last Wednesday by
defeating Roanoke College 2-1.
On the road last Saturday the
Generals lost to Division III na-
tionally ranked Eliza
Elizabethtown College 5-1.

The Roanoke game upped the
Generals’ conference record to
2-0, making Saturday’s game at
Lynchburg a key contest as far
as the 1977 ODAC title is con-
cerned. Overall, the Generals
are 5-2 with nine games remain-
ing, seven of those contests be-
ing against NCAA Division I
teams.

The Roanoke Maroons,
revitalized this fall under new
coach Mike Doran, jumped out
to an early 1-0 lead with seven
minutes gone in the first half.
Ten minutes later, junior right
wing Howie Collier recorded his
first goal of the season ona nifty
pass from Junior Bill Stone
making a 1-1 halftime score.
With ten minutes gone in the
final half, Collier was awarded
a penalty kick, converted, mak-
ing it a 2-1 count in favor of
W&L. Freshman goalie Kevin
Carney shut out the Maroons
the rest of the way giving W&L
their fifth win, of the campaign.

Senior Mark Bennett played the
first half in goal.

Elizabethtown led the Generals

Lacrosse Undergrads
Lose Exhibition Match

For the second time in three
tries, the W&L alumni lacrosse
players defeated the varsity,
this time by a 9-6 score on mud-
dy Wilson Field last Sunday.
The alumni also won 17-12 in
1976, with the varsity winning
7-4 in 1975.

A crowd of about 2000 watch-
ed as Don Carroll (’76), the
leading point scorer in W&L
lacrosse history scored two
goals and had two assists in
leading the alumni. Biff Martin
(’77) had a goal and an assist,
while singletons were recorded
by Dave Warfield (75), Rob
Morgan (’76), Doug Fuge (’77),
Jack Dudley ('77),, John, Lalley.

(°74), and Key Miller (75).

Sophomore attackman Bill
Mahon led the varsity with two
goals, while John Black, Jeff
Fritz, Roman Kaupecky, and
Jay Foster also scored. It was a
nip and tuck affair throughout,
tied 3-3 after one quarter. 5-5 at
half, and the alumni leading 7-6
after three.

The 1977 Generals completed
their regular season at 11-3 and
ranked fifth nationally in the
University Division. They lost
to Maryland in the quarter-
finals of the NCAA tournament.
The team opens the 1978 season
on March 4th at Duke.

 

Southern loss Martin had seven
goals with Romich notching six
tallies. After trailing early,
W&L led most of the final three
quarters by one or two goals,
before number one seed Ga.
Southern tied the game at 17

with thirty seconds to play.
Another quick goal put the
Generals down 18-17 with 0:13
seconds to play. When asked
how his team managed to give
up two goals in the final 30
seconds of the match, Coach
Stearns replied, ‘‘Inexperience.
We’ve made remarkable pro-
gress over the past few weeks,
but the mental errors are still
killing us.”’

Romich, the team’s leading
goal scorer, hit the net seven

times against Southern giving
him 17 goals in three games.
The win over ECU came by
forfeit. The crowd for the tour-
nament games was an en-
couraging one, with anticipa-
tion running high for the
Generals’ next home action on
October 28-29 for the Virginia
State Championships.

This weekend’s upcoming
matches will probably be the
most important all season for
the Generals. They face the

powerhouses of the league, in-
cluding unbeaten Slippery Rock
State. The crucial game could
be against Penn. State at their
home pool this Friday night.

Drops 5th Straight

by Pete Abitante

Three touchdowns within 82
seconds in the first quarter was
all Maryville needed in coasting
to a 42-0 victory over the
Generals at homecoming. Play-
ing in a constant rain which
made field conditions
treacherous, the Generals were
unable to get untracked chalk-
ing up only 8 first downs. In ad-
dition, they managed only 120
yards in the air and an increadi-
ble minus 16 yards rushing.

Maryville took their first
possession of the game and
drove 62 yards in 11 plays with
Keith Goodwin crasing in from
one yard out, providing all that
was needed for the Scots.

As in the past four games, tur-
novers cost W&L this one.
Maryville transformed four of
nine W&L miscues (6 intercep-
tions and 3 fumbles) into 28
points.

Safety Steve Savage in-
tercepted a Scott Swope pass on
W&L’s second. psssession,
returning it 15 yards to the
Generals’ 18 thus setting up a
Charlie Hixon to Goodwin

touchdown pass. The kick by
Tim Kelly gave the Scots a 14
point lead. Savage intercepted
another Swope pass on the ensu-

ing passession returning it 38
yards for a touchdown.

On the first play of the second
quarter, Ted Hissey, replacing
Swope, was intercepted by Mike
Thomas which led to another
opposition score. Seventy-six
yards and 10 plays later, Hixon
hit Dan Colely with a 15 yard
pass to make it 28-0 at halftime.

The halftime festivities,
organized by senior Ed Wick,
proved to be the highlight of the
game when Julie Osborne
representing Sigma Nu, was
awarded the ‘‘Shillington
Pucker of the year’’ and title of
homecoming queen.

A Hissey fumble on the
Generals 10 yard line led to the
only score of the third period—
an 11 yard run by Marksberry.
Freshman quarterback Jeff
Raby capped the scoring for the
day hitting Clayton Crosby with
an 11 yard pass in the fourth
quarter to cap the most disap-
pointing day of the season for
Washington and Lee.

A bright spot, if there is such
a thing in this game, was
flanker Rich Wiles who with
four receptions, upped his con-
ference lead to 21. Don

W&L Ruggers “Beaten” by Veemees

by Kevin Dwyer

Under the leadership of a new
coach, Constantine Roussos of
the Math Department, the W&L
Rugby Club met VMI in its first
contest last Thursday afternoon
on the VMI parade ground. In
what turned out to be an uneven
matchup, VMI’s squad bested
W&L 38-4. VMI’s team is more
organized and better trained
than the W&L club. Club
Treasurer Rob Lee said,
“Naturally, we’re disappointed
that we didn’t win, but we area
much stronger team this year,
and things are looking good.”

Several VMI goals were
disallowed during the game,
and one ‘‘veemee”’ was expelled
from the game for unnecessary
roughness. This particular
player is known to W&L Rugby
fans as simply ‘Big Daddy.”
He was VMI’s leading scorer
until his ejection for deliberate-

ly punching a W&L man after
the ball was dead. The referee
was a member of VMI’s squad,
but despite this, ‘‘Big Daddy’”’
hit him in the face with the ball
in disgust following his expul-
sion. He went off the field to a

chorus of blood-curdling hur-

rahs from his teammates.

The topic of the day was the
roughness of the ‘‘veemees.”’
Several W&L men were heard
complaining about the illegal
shoves and hits after a ball was
ruled dead, and about un-

necessary brutality on the part
of more than a few of VMI’s
team members. Club President
Bev Mauck was especially
puzzled, since this game was
technically only a scrimmage
and because there was no of-
ficial referee present. Said
Mauck, “We just don’t unders-
tand why they were hitting so
hard.”’ One W&L man had to be
hospitalized for what were ap-
parently internal injuries.
W&L’s Bob Connally scored

Alumnus Makes
It Big In NFL

by Pete Abitante

While many National Foot-
ball League teams make
numerous changes in their
player personnel framework
during the off season, few alter
their front office structure.
However, there are exceptions
to every rule and the American
Conference New York Jets pro-
ve the exception to this one.

After two consecutive 3-11
seasons, the worst in the team’s
seventeen year history, Jet
owner Leon Hess, with vivid
memories of the 1969 Super
Bowl championship still linger-
ing, decided it was high time to
get back on the winning track.

In order to insure a smooth
turnabout in the front office,
Hess hired Jim Kensil as presi-
dent and chief operating officer.
Kensil had worked in the league
office for sixteen years, the last
nine of which were served as ex-
ecutive director, or in the words
of commissioner Pete Rozelle,
“my offensive and defensive
coordinator.”’

To turn things around on the
playing field, the Jets chose
W&L’s own Walt Michaels to
become the eighth head coach
in their history and W&L’s first
representative in the profes-
sional coaching ranks.

Playing fullback, linebacker,
and guard, Michaels earned a
B.A. in psychology, graduating
in 1951. As a player and person
he was unsurpassed at W&L,
leading the Generals to the
Gator Bowl in 1950.

Drafted by the Cleveland
Browns in the seventh round,
Walt was traded to the Green
Bay Packers but was reac-

pleasure.

quired by the Browns in 1952.
He went on to become an
outstanding linebacker as
evidenced by his All-Pro status
from 1957-60.

Retiring after the 1961 season,
Michaels joined the Oakland
Raiders coaching staff as defen-
sive line coach for a year before
coming to the Jets in a similar
position in 1963.

For ten years Michaels
masterminded the growth of the
New Yorkers’ defense,
culminating in the 1969 Super
Bowl when his ‘‘troops’’ held
the Colts scoreless until four
minutes were left in the game.

After three years (1973-75) as
defensive coordinator with the
Philadelphia Eagles, Michaels
returned to New York. His pro-
motion to head coach last year
was more of an election than a
selection and it is not hard to
see why—the Jets are off to
their best start since 1972.

While losing the first two
games of the season the Jets re-
bounded to stun the New
England Patriots 30-27 at Shea
Stadium. This past week they
defeated the Buffalo Bills 24-19
to even their season record at
two and two. In both games
Michaels’ presence has been
evident as the Jets have won
their games on good defense.

With Miami, Oakland, and
New England on three con-
secutive weekends, the defense
has its work cut out for it. But
with Walt Michaels at the helm,
you can bet the Jets will be
mentally and_ physically
prepared to enter a new era in
their history as well as a new
era for W&L. Good Luck Walt.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Students harassed

As it should be common knowledge by now, the city
of Lexington depends on the W&L community for so
much. Jobs are provided for many Lexington citizens
at W&L, which keeps the unemployment rate down.
W&L, being a tourist attraction, draws crowds of peo-
ple to the city every year and along with them their
money. But the most important contribution by W&L
to the Lexington community is asa source of
revenues for the city in the forms of parking and traf-
fic fines; fines for ridiculous, vague and outdated or-
dinances; and now potential fines for just being
ourselves and partying a bit too much.

It seems to us, that in this quiet, peaceful town
where crime seems to be nonexistent, except for irate
Lex high football fans after a loss on Friday night, the
police have nothing better to do than to harass our
fraternities for trying to escape a little from the
tedium of week-long intense studying. Granted,
sometimes the partying can become a little too in-
tense and get out of hand, but we have serious doubts
whether a little wild partying warrants a threat of the
maximum penalty of $1,000 and a year in prison from
the town’s police chief.

Also, it seems odd to us that even though ordinances
15-31 and 15-32 have been on the books for years, the
police force has just now decided to enforce them. The
frat houses have been around for years, and have
been assumedly partying at the same intensity level
year after year. The residents of the neighborhoods in
which the fraternities are situated presumedly are
accustomed to frat parties, so why all of a sudden are
they lodging complaints against them. Or are they ac-
tually lodging complaints? It seems very incredible |
to us that a sedate, quiet, and rela tively civilized
fraternity such as SPE would ever be cited for being
disorderly or irritatingly noisy.

This appears to be another arguable case of harass-
ment, just as the “‘launching of illegal missiles”’ last
year (the throwing of snowballs) was another
arguable case of harassment. Also, just as the use of
tape measures by policemen to make sure students
don’t overstep the boundaries of the law and park
their cars an inch over what is stipulated is an
arguable case of harassment. The town speed traps
are another case, but we won’t mention them here.

How much longer must our students continue to pay
the salaries.of the town’s employees? How much
longer do we have to be subjected to this harassment
by the police? How much longer will the people of
Lexington get their jollies at our expense?

Washington and Lee should not have to sit back and
watch its students be exploited like this. W&L poten-
tially has quite a bit of strong influence in the city
government. We think it is about time that this in-
fluence should be exerted. Professor of economics
Charles Phillips is the Mayor. Retired professor Leon
Sensabaugh and professor Thomas Imeson are both
members of the city council. Dean of students Lewis
John is a member of the school board. Gentlemen,
priorities must be established.

The situation has not yet gotten out of hand, but it
has the potential for doing so. The problems that exist
between the students of W&L and the citizens of Lex-
ington must be resolved now before sentiments
become bitter. As with all compromises, both sides
must be willing to give a little. Perhaps the students
should become a little more considerate; the town
definitely should become more sensible and tolerant.
Unless this compromise is reached, Lexington could
experience ‘town and gown’’ riots similar to those
that frequently occurred during medieval times.

Letters
To
Editor

Dear Editor,

It seems to us to be a very ap-
propriate time to speak out
against both the opinion ex-
pressed in your last editorial
and the general attitude of a
great many W&L students.

The belief (or even the
thought) that a ‘‘rack date’’ can
add to one’s ‘character, per-
sonality, GPA, and campus
prestige” is plainly absurd. On
the contrary, the “rack date”’
should be regarded as a
disgrace to the total character
of the student. However, it
seems that this opinion is
shared and voiced by very few
students.

We attend a school that em-
phasizes honor within the stu-
dent body, which is a credit to
this institution. It seems to be a
hypocritical paradox that
females are treated so
dishonorably and_ without
respect by so many members of
the student body. No longer are
females regarded as_in-
dividuals with feelings, but in-
stead of sexual goals that must
be conquered in order to obtain
social status.

As students who are concern-
ed about the future of W&L and
its students, we ask for a reex-
amination of each individual’’s
attitudes towards the opposite
sex. We need to look upon them
not as toys or playthings to be
discarded as soon as we are
finished with them, but as real
people with feelings.

We feel that the necessities of
life are met, not by sex, but
through the acceptence of the
love given by Jesus Christ.

Prayerfully,
Mike Brown °80

UT to open with Oedipus

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor

To begin to get an understan-
ding of Sophocles’ classic
tragedy, Oedipus Rex, it is
necessary to take a look at the
civilization from which it
sprung. Athens was the home of

_ the first great democracy, and
early in the 5th century B.C.,
they astonished the world (and
themselves) by beating off the
forces of a much more
militaristic country, the Per-
sian Empire. The result of the
victory in the Persian War was
a fantastic burst of energy in
political innovation, civic con-
struction and beautification—
and the great blossoming of the
arts.

The Athenians’ invented
theatre as we know it today. Its
origins in Greece are as far as
history can trace. The greatest
victories in classic tragedy oc-
curred during the Age of
Pericles, the political leader
who steered Athens through her
greatest era, roughly 460-400
B.C. It was in this period that
Sophocles, ‘‘the most human of
Greek tragic poets,’’ made his
appearance on the literary
stage.

As one critic has put it, ‘“We
know of 8 plays in antiquity call-
ed Oedipus.... Yet, surely, there
is only one Oedipus, and this is
the masterpiece of Sophocles,
Oedipus Rex. The story of this
tragedy is among the best-
known in all literature. The
House of Cadmus, ruling house
.of Thebes, because it had in
some way offended the gods,
was doomed to catastrophe.

As time passes, it is the story
of one man, the current king,
Oedipus (played in the W&L
production by senior Warren
Mowry), who searches for the
reason for the disfavor. The plot

is centered on the unwinding of
the realization that he himself
has polluted the society by his
own actions. Oedipus, com-
pletely ignorant of what he was

doing, fulfilled the dread pro-
phecy that he would slay his
father and marry his mother.
The story closes with his per-
sonal remorse and agony, as he
blinds himself, and banishes
himself from the kingdom he
loves so dearly.

The campus production will
open Monday, October 24, and
run through Saturday, October
29. Presented in the Old Boiler
Room, all curtain times will be
at 8 p.m. Box office staffers will

Lincoln Conspiracy Panned

The Land of Oz

by Seth Oserin

If you recall the contents of
this column last week, you
might remember the surprise
that was expressed at the fact
that Lexington was chosen as a
first-run, premier town for Sunn
Pictures’ ‘‘The Lincoln Con-
spiracy.’’ Well folks, I've seen
the picture, and now know why
Lexington was among those
lucky cities chosen to debut this
movie.

It’s bad.

The movie discloses the true
reason Lincoln was killed, and
the conspiracy developed
toward this ain. In fact, the
plan was coordinated by Lin-
coln’s own cabinet after it was
discovered that Lincoln was
planning to give the South back
the vote along with $400 million.
The cabinet feared that the ad-
dition of the South to Congress
would bring so many
Democrats into the legislature
that all their power would be

‘Tdiotic

lost. The conspiracy, OK’ed by
Stanton, was originally to have
Lincoln kidnapped. However,
an over-hateful John Wilkes
Booth decided to revenge the
South and _ assassinate the
President instead of carrying
out the planned kidnapping.

To be polite, I'll say the acting
was bad. John Anderson (as
Lincoln) appears to be doing a
good job in the beginning, but
shortly after you keep thinking
he’s going to fall asleep in the
middle of a line. Bradford
Killman plays John Wilkes
Booth, and is pretty good Occa-
sionally. The problem with his
performance is that he often
comes across as Snydly
Whiplash in a melodrama with
Polly Purebred (Lincoln, of

course, being Polly). The rest of

the acturs were just plain awful.

The man we have to thank for
all this was the director, James
Conway, who ably took an
script and made it

begin taking ticket reservations
next Monday, October 17.
Again, tickets are free for all
members of the W&L
call

community—simply

 

463-9111, ext. 371 starting next
Monday, from 10-4.

The cast for the production in-
cludes, beside Mr. Mowry: Jim
Weatherstone (Creon); David
Chester (Tiresias, the aged pro-

phet); Ellen Jervey (as
Jocasta, Oedipus’ wife and
mother); Stoney Cantler

(Messenger); Ty York (High
Priest); Jeffrey Buntrock
(Shepherd); and Rich Allen
(Chorus Leader), along with
other actors of the cast in the

moronic. Moreover, I would
probably go so far as to say he
was the cause of all the bad ac-
ting that seemed to infest the
movie. This stands to reason,
after looking at the rest of the
cleverness presented. For ex-
ample, there is one scene where
the presuers in a horse chase
are accidently blocked off by a
horse drawn cart that looks as
unexpected as tomorrow morn-
ing. It's also worthy to note that
all of the brief battle scenes
shown were probably shot in the
bathroom of a Kroger’s super-
market, with the scenes all
seeming to be out-takes from a
Carol Burnett show, along with
the narrator, who's going on
about what's happening back at
the ranch.

As far as the actual contents
of the movie? Let's just say
that upon leaving the theater, it
seemed that the whole contents
of the.movie could have been
put down on two type written

nartne *

chorus.

The show is directed by
department head in drama, Lee
Kahn. Assisting him in direc-
ting tasks and as _ stage
manager is Bradley Lewis. Set
design is by Tom Ziegler,
assisted by Hunt Brown.

In commenting on the show
Mr. Kahn had the following to
say: ‘‘My feelings about doing a
classic Greek tragedy really
revolve around a way to doit, so
a contemporary audience can
get the flavor and essence of the
Greek theatric-religious ex-
perience. For me, this was com-
posed of three parts: structure,
rhythm, and irony. them
without any of the ‘trappings’ of
what we have come to look on as
theatre.

“In other words, the playing
of the characters will be done
through language and action—
not costume and make-up. For
example, the aged Tiresias will
appear at first glance, as a
twenty-year old man. His age
will come not out of graying his
hair, but out of his language and
mannerism.

“Rhythm is the key to the
whole show. The chorus, with
their signals, boxes, and bells,
will carry the majority of this.
And the final spectacle will
come out of the lighting.
Oedipus Rex is being done in an
all-new arena style by designer
Ziegler. Lights, coming out of
the floor, will reflect on the mir-
rored ceiling of the set in
various combinations. It is a
simple, straightforward ap-
proach to the play.”’

And if Mr. Kahn’s enthusiasm
is any indication at all, this pro-
duction of Oedipus Rex is bound
to be memorable. So make
reservations for the play that
sits ‘‘as a Colossus, astride the
history of tragedy....’’

Hollins
Play
Announced

Enjoyable. Fast paced. Witty.
At times, uncommonly brutal.
That’s how director Jack Phend
describes The Effect of Gamma
Rays on Man-in-the Moon
Marigolds, the fall theatre pro-
duction at Hollins College.
Shows are tonight (Oct. 13) with
nightly productions beginning
at 8:15 p.m. through Saturday
(October 15) in the Hollins Lit-
tle Theatre.

The Effect of Gamma Rays
on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds
won critical acclaim during its
New York run and was awarded
the Pulitzer prize, the Obie
Award, and the New York
Critics Circle Award as best
American play of the 1970
season.

Phend, who is designer and
technical director at the Hollins

theatre, says that the
characters in the play are uni-
que.

“But they’re much like

ourselves, too,’ he explains.
“We see the cruelties and
sometimes the goodness in each
of them. There is at least one
line or moment that will strike a
chord and be remembered by
everyone who attends.”’

The Little Theatre box office,
362-6517, will be open weekdays,
4:30 to 7 p.m., through Friday
(October 14), and one hour
before each show. Reservations
may also be made by calling the
Office of Public Information at
Hollins, 362-6452, weekdays
from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.mm
Cost is $3 for adults, $1.50 for
students.

We gladly go after out-of-

rather like shooting an arrow

out-of-print market and then the
bids come in from 2nd-hand

It is startling the price ranges
we sometimes’ get—real

Over the years we have at-
tracted a surprising mail order
business as well. Alumni find it
easier to write to the W&L

The Kresge Foundation, a
philanthropic organization in
Troy, Michigan that supports
all educational institutions,
gave Washington and Lee
University a $250,000 grant last
summer. The grant, given on
the condition that the university
can raise all of the remaining
funds itself, will be used to
cover the costs of completing
the new campus library behind
Washington Hall.

McCormick Library, the pre-
sent university library that was
built in 1908, has been faced
with numerous operating pro-
blems in recent years. Original-
ly built to serve the school’s 500
students, it is no longer capable
of meeting the challenges of
university life despite many at-
tempts at rearranging its in-
terior. After the new library is
completed in late 1978, McCor-
mick will be renovated to house
the School of Commerce,
Economics, and Politics. The
present Commerce _ School,
Newcomb Hall, will become
general classroom space.

“When McCormick Library
was built, it was built in a man-
ner where it.could not be ex-
panded,’’ said Director of
Development Farris Hotchkiss.
‘This time, however, we are
building the new library so it
can be expanded without any
problems.”’

The problems of operating
McCormick Library have caus-
ed no small amount of difficulty
to university administrators.
The library’s operating budget,

just $84,000 in 1972, soared to
$290,000 during the past
academic year. The rising ex-
penses have been necessary in
order to finance the cost of
10,000 new books a year and the
general upkeep of the rest of the
books and equipment such as
micro-film and audio-visual
machines. Rising fuel and elec-
tricity costs, of course, have ad-
ded to the numerous problems.

When completed, the new
library is expected to alleviate
many of the current problems.
Among others, the advantages
of the new building will be its
spacious interior, the addition
of more study rooms and car-
rels, and the library’s capacity
to store over 500,000 volumes.
About half of the university’s
students will be able ot study in
the new library, as compared to
just 350 students that a crowded
McCormick Library can ac-
commodate.

The new library, now about
half-finished, has been in con-
struction for the past two years.
By the time it is finished, the en-
tire project will have cost
somewhere in between $2 and $3
million. According to Hot-
chkiss, the remaining funds will
be accumulated through alumni
gifts and donations.

Hotchkiss described the new
library as being built of red
brick and styled in a manner
similar to the law school. “‘It
will fit the campus very well,”’
he continued. ‘‘The style of the
building will be such that it will
blend right in with the other
buildings on campus.”’

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has received a gift of
$50,000 from Mrs. G. Holbrook
Barber of Quoque, N. Y., to
establish an honor scholarship
endowment in memory of her
late husband, a 1917 graduate of
the university.

Income from the scholarship
endowment is to be awarded an-
nually to the undergraduate
senior who has “made the
greatest contribution to the
spirit of the campus and univer-
sity life,” taking into account
participation in university ac-

tivities, helpfulness toward
others, respect for fellow
students, character, and
scholarship.

The recipient of the G.
Holbrook Barber Scholarship
will be chosen by a panel con-
sisting of the dean of The Col-
lege, Washington and Lee’s
liberal-arts and sciences divi-
sion, and two student represen-
tatives named by the president
of the university.

After graduation from
Washington and Lee in 1917,
Holbrook Barber enetered the
College of Physicians and
Surgeons of Columbia Universi-
ty and received his M.D. degree
in 1921. He was a physician in
private practice in Brooklyn,
N.Y., until his retirement in
1951, and was medical director
of Manhattan Life Insurance
Co. for many years as well. He
died Nov. 6, 1970.

At W&L he was a classmate

of the late Harry K. (Cy)
Young, probably the most
outstanding athlete’ in

Washington and Lee’s history,
and a classmate and fraternity
brother of the late Dean Frank
J. Gilliam, dean of students and
admissions director at W&L for
more than 40 years.

Stearns says, “Right now we

the team isn’t going to go all out
against Slippery Rock, because
they have two matches against
Columbia and Villanova whom
he feels the team can beat. If
the Generals can capture two
wins on this trip they will
automatically receive a bid to
the Middle-Atlantic Champion-

Penn State. That would be quite
an accomplishment for a team

State, with 81 points, was of no
real consequence in the meet.

Co-captain Bill Welch said
that he thought that the
Generals would do much better
at the conference meet against
Lynchburg. The rain on Satur-
day was not much of a factor
because the course was not very
slippery. The disadvantage,
Welch maintains, was due to the
way in which the course was
laid out. He felt that a much bet-
ter performance could have
been executed by Washington
and Lee, if the Generals’ run-
ners had been familiar with the
course.

The Generals, now eight wins
and two losses for the season,
have an away meet this Friday
at Bridgewater. The opponents
will be Bridgewater College and
Roanoke College. Coach Miller
said that Roanoke would not be
a factor in the race, but that
Bridgewater could give the
Generals problems. Miller lists
Bridgewater in the same class
as Lynchburg. However, Miller
feels that if freshmen Chris
Daniels and Hans Furuland
move up in the scoring picture
that Washington and Lee should

called for a penalty. I think both.
calls were clearly examples of
hometown officiating.”’ As for
the other two goals, Piranian
cites a breakdown in his man-
to-man defense. Add to these
two mental errors the fact that
the Generals outshot their oppo-
nent, and one sees that the
game was not as lopsided as the
score might indicate.

Todd Tyson had the W&L
goal, his second of the season,
with the assist going to Ben
Easton, his first of the year.
Piranian called his team’s ef-
fort ‘“‘a super one, with the final
score not being indicative of the
closeness of the game.’”’ W&L
had three second half shots
labeled goal that missed by in-
ches.

Saturday on the road, the
Generals take on the Lynchburg
Hornets, defending ODAC and
VISA champions, and like W&L
currently undefeated at 2-0 in
the conference this fall.
Although early in the season,
this game will go a long way in
determining the 1977 league
champion. This is the 25th game
in the series, with the Hornets
leading 15-8-1. W&L lost 4-1 last
year, with the last W&L win
coming by a 2-1 score in 1974.
Lynchburg is 4-4 overall, losing
to Virginia 1-0 and defeating
EMC 3-2 last week.

the only “‘tri’’ or goal the
Generals saw all afernoon early
in the first half. From then on
out it was VMI’s game, through
both of the nonstop 35 minute
halves.

This is shaping up to be one of
the most exciting seasons the
club has ever had, with future
contests including Lynchburg,
U. Va., and VMI again. Seven
freshmen are currently starting
and, according to President
Mauck, ‘‘There’s plenty of room
for anyone who’s interested.”
On Saturday, the club travels to
Hampden-Sydney for a match
before the football game’ in
which H-S will be playing the
Generals for their Homecom-

in both Rugby and Football and
a large crowd is expected.

Budget Requests
Acted Upon

(continued from page |)

its final allotment of $29,550 was
more than $4,000 less than it re-
quested. Several highly placed
sources within the SAB have
said the organization is thinking
of dispensing with Winter
Weekend or scaling it down in
order to stretch its budget.
Originally, $6,000 was alloted
for Winter Weekend in the
SAB’s budget.

Additionally, out of the SAB’s
budget must come $2,200 to pay
for live entertainment in the
Cockpit. The newly formed
Music Union will have the final
say over what entertainment
gets booked into the Cockpit’
Underhill said. Although the
M.U. will be under the wing of
the SAB, the SAB must give the
Union all of the money the E.C.
alloted for it, Underhill said. He
said the E.C. would name a new
University Center Committee
chairman who would serve as
intermediary between the SAB
and the Music Union. The chair-
man would be a voting member
of the SAB, Underhill said. He
said applications for the posi-
tion would be accepted at Mon-
day’s E.C. meeting.

Galen Trussel, a member of
the SAB and the Music Union,
expressed an interest in being
the new chairman at the past
week’s E.C. meeting. Insiders
agree that he will probably be
named U.C.C. chairman. Bill

 

Tucker, co-chairman of the

SAB, presently holds that posi-

tion.

The law school, despite
receiving $3,000 more than it got
last year, saw its proposed
budget cut by almost $1,500. A
motion by Missal to take. $400
more from the law school and
give it to the Ring-tum Phi was
voted down 7-3. Missal, Pen-
tifallo and Bovay voted for the
measure. Opponents, the most
outspoken of whom was law
representative Rick Goddard,
said they would also like to see
the Phi get back $400 tentative-
ly taken away from it last week,
but would not like to see the
money come from the law
school.

It was generally agreed by
E.C. members that they wanted
to retrieve the money they took
away from the Phi last week,
because, as George Griffin said,
the newspaper was the only
organization to cut its budget.
Phi editor Mike Gallagher
pointed out that whereas last
year’s paper payed for 65 per
cent of its cost from student
funds, this year’s paper was
asking for only 25 per cent of its
cost from student funds. This is
despite almost a 100 per cent in-
crease in cost, Gallagher said.
Griffin remarked, ‘‘I don’t think
they can doit.”

 

W&L to
debate Britons

The Washington and Lee
University debate team will
meet a specially selected team
of Britons in an exhibition
debate to be held in the Moot
Court Room of Lewis Hall Oct.
13 at 7:30 p.m.

The Washington and Lee
team will take the affirmative
side on the topic ‘Resolved:
This house prefers pornography
to censorship.”’

Halford Ryan, advisor to the
debate team, said the topic was
chosen from a list supplied by
the British team.

Ryan said that this exhibition
should show an interesting jux-
taposition of the English
debating style, characterized
by wit and style, and the
American debaters’ typical use
of evidence and reason.

The uncertainties of the legal
status of pornography and
moral problems of censorship
are two aspects that the
Washington and Lee team will
explore.

A nationwide contest took
place in England last year to
find two college students to
represent the Britons on this
tour. Philip Engleman of the
University College of London
and R. Victoria Scholfield of Ox-
ford University were chosen.
Their tour will take them to 32
universities and colleges east of
the Mississippi.

There will be no charge for

 

admission.

Oct. 19,

McPherson to speak

On next Wednesday evening,
October 19, at 8:00 p.m. in
Parmly 201, the Glasgow En-
dowment Committee will pre-
sent James A. McPherson
reading selections of his work.
Mr. McPherson, a highly prais-
ed young short story writer, is
at present writer in residence
and associate professor of
English at the University of
Virginia. Some of his work has
been gathered in two collec-
tions, Hue and Cry (1969) and
Elbow Room (1977).

Mr. McPherson was born in
Savannah, Georgia, attended
Morris Brown College in Atlan-
ta, Morgan State University in
Baltimore, went on to earn his
LL.B. from Harvard, and got an
M.F.A. at the University of
Iowa's Writers Workshop. He
won a national award for fiction
while at Morris Brown. His in-
terest in urban social problems
while in law school led to essays
in the Atlantic Monthly, for

whom he also wrote. On the
strength of these he was made a
contributing editor to the
magazine.

Subsequently his stories have
been widely published in
periodicals ranging from The
Reader's Digest to Playboy,
The Massachusetts Review and
Ploughshares, and anthologized
over the past decade in
numerous college texts as well
as in Best American Short
Stories and 0. Henry Prize
Stories. In recent years he has
taught at Iowa, Morgan State,
and the University of California
(Santa Cruz). Acclaimed for his
sensitive handling of uniquely
black American experience as
well as for his mastery of craft,
Mr. McPherson has been called
by Ralph Ellison ‘‘a writer of in-
sight, sympathy, and humor
and one of the most gifted young
Americans I’ve had_ the
privilege to read.”’

Music Union combined

with University Center

by Galen Trussell

The dilema surrounding the
control of entertainment in the
Cockpit was solved Monday,
when the E.C. voted to in-
corporate W&L’s Student
Music Union under the Univer-
sity Center Committee (UCC).

The E.C. decided to take ap-
plications for a new UCC chair-
man and committee members
at next week’s meeting. The
new UCC chairman would act
as a mediator between the UCC
and the SAB. When the UCC
decides on an act for the
Cockpit the new UCC chairman
will go to the SAB for the funds.
The UCC will still have a $2,200
budget to work with.

The Student Music Union will
serve in an advisory capacity to
the new UCC. The Union will act
primarily as a screening agent
for acts and will provide input
into the UCC about acts desired.

The SAB will have no veto
power over how the UCC elects
to use its money, except in a
case where the UCC would need
additional funds for higher
class acts.

The UCC will also be in con-
trol of movies in the Cockpit,
University Center magazine
subscriptions and the Cockpit
Christmas party. The E.C. plan-
ned that the new UCC chairman
would designate a_ separate
committee or individuals to
deal with these matters, and
utilize the Seudent Music Union
exclusively for the decisions on
musical entertainment in the
Cockpit.

The UCC was originally a
separate entity, funded entirely
by the University Center direc-
tor. When the E.C. formed the
SAB several years ago, it in-
corporated the UCC into the
SAB.

WHY IS SIGLINDA STEINFULLER
DEAN OF BEER?

Fellow Beer Persons.

 

WHY NOT?

Life is full of unanswered questions such as: Is there intelligent life
elsewhere in the universe? And if so, do they wear socks?

In beer, however, there are no unanswered questions. Because there
is only one word for beer, and you know it.

Schlitz.

Therefore, as your Dean of Beer, | suggest you research
the essential rightness of the word for yourself at your next
social function. Or even your next antisocial function.

And please note: The recommended source
material for locating the word can be found in any

phone booth. In other words, look in the Yellow

Pages. Under “Beer:

Well, now Rush is finally
fover. All the fraternities did
very well. The new one did ex-
ceptionally well, too. Halloween
is approaching so the E’s will
probably loose a few pledges.
Several frats were harrassed
this past week-end by the
police. Stereos at four in the
morning, really. We hear that a
certain LAX goalie and a presi-
dent of a small fraternity spent
the night in jail. Well almost;
brotherhood to the rescue. It’s a
good thing, what would they
ever have talked about.

Two Keydets were at the IFC
meeting this weekend. They
were there to ask that they be
allowed to attend all frat parties
without a written invitation.
How socially unacceptable! We
Sita heard of such a thing
since a certain secretary was
invited into the demonstration
circuit here in big LEX. Dean
Diddle (making his first ap-
pearance at an IFC meeting)
said the reason that the Keydets
want this is that there ‘‘are a lot
of Mickey Mouse rules at VMI.”
Of course, he said this after the
Keydets had left.

The second Art opening was
kicked off by another Wine and
mold party. I really think they
kept that cheese from the last
party. I felt compelled to eat
some hoping that Gordon the
terrible would give them more
money for next time, and to buy
a leash for those damn dogs.
The E.C. did their work on the
budget. Slash here slash there.
Ariel was upset because they
were the only one _ foolish
enough not to pad their budget.
Mock convention had 1,300
dollars, and when their orator
was finished the E. C. took
away $1,000. I'll tell you it was
worse than the gong show. The
law school got their fair share; I
hope they use some of the
money to foster better student
undergrad relationships. More
about the law school and the law
wives next week.

Last Monday, the Executive
Committee held another weekly
meeting. The prospect of con-
vening the meeting remained
dubious for several moments as
straggling members streamed
into the conference room up to
ten minutes late.

The business got under way
when secretary Neil Pentifallo
informed the E.C. that the
Development Office had re-
quested ten members to sit in on
a W&L question and answer
seminar for parents on Parents’
Weekend. The seminar, dealing
with campus social life and the
Honor System, did not interest
ten volunteers so the E.C. decid-
ed to ask different class
presidents to help out.

Next on the agenda was the
matter of Student Publication
Board salaries. Citing the con-
stitution, vice president George
Griffin moved that discussion of
the controversial subject be
deferred a week. Griffin’s mo-
tion also stipulated that during
the next week the E.C. would
post signs throughout the cam-
pus announcing an open hearing
on the salary issue next Monday

night. The motion passed
unanimously.

FIJI fined for

homecoming noise

Charlie Brown, president of
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity,
was fined $10 in General
District Court Tuesday morn-
ing, for violation of Lexington’s
noise ordinance. Brown pleaded
guilty to a violation of city or-
dinance 15-32, Section B, which
pertains to loud noise heard out-
side after 11 p.m.

Lexington police issued
Brown the summons to appear
in court during a Fiji combo
party on Saturday, October 8th.
As president of the fraternity,
Brown was “‘responsible’’ for
any law violation made collec-
tively by members of Phi Gam-
ma Delta. In addition to the
fine, Brown had to pay $13 in
court costs.

Freedom of the press

by Neil Cote

John C. Merrill, a former
reporter and correspondent for
a number of American and
foreign newspapers and cur-
rently a journalism professor at
the University of Missouri, lec-
tured to a near-capacity crowd
in duPont Auditorium on Oc-
tober 13 on the subject ‘““From
Press Freedom to Press
Responsibility: A Good or Bad
Trend.”’

In his speech, Merrill stated
that the theory of freedom of the
press is gradually being replac-
ed by a belief that journalists
have a responsibility to the
public. Merrill said this is a
dangerous trend because it
could give birth to an
authoritarian press system in
the United States in the future.”

One of Merrill’s main points
was that, contrary to what most
people believe, a free press does
not necessarily have to play the
role of a government watchdog
or the fourth branch of the

government. If members of the
press are forced into such a
role, Merrill said, the press
would not be free. Merrill
declared that members of the
press should have the liberty to
chose whatever role they want
to fulfill, even if this meant that
some journalists would choose
to become irresponsible and in-
competent.

“Don’t get me wrong, I’m not
in favor of irresponsible jour-
nalism,’’ he stated. ‘‘I just don’t
like the idea of the press having
to follow the theory of social
responsibility. If the press is
forced to follow this theory,
then it isn’t a free press.”’

Merrill also expressed fear
that a number of forces are en-
couraging ‘ conformity in
American journalism. The for-
mation of huge newspaper
chains, for example, have
gradually reduced the
pluralism of ideas which once
was one of the strong points of

tion charge on Oct. 25. Whether
these fraternities will be fined
more severely for future or-
dinance infractions was not
made known by the judge,
Brown said. Brown added, “The
judge was really pretty nice
about it.”

Faculty surveys
independent exams

by Galen Trussell

Questions by _ faculty
members about the security of
independent exams initiated a
survey by the Faculty E.C. to
determine the feasibility of con-
tinuing the present independent
exam schedule.

The Faculty E.C. circulated a
questionaire to all teachers ear-
ly last week. The questionaires
were to be returned to Dean At-
wood, chairman of the faculty
E.C., by Monday, October 17.
The Faculty E.C. will review
the results of the questionaire
and present a recommendation
to the faculty, either to retain or
throw out the present indepen-
dent exam schedule. The facul-
ty will then vote as a body on the
recommendation of the Faculty
E.C. at a faculty meeting to be
held November 7.

According to Dean Atwood,
the results of the survey cannot
be made public until the Facul-
ty E.C. reports its findings to
the University Council on
November 3. Atwood added that

Frosh runoffs

by Kevin Dwyer

Today’s run-off for freshman
class president and Executive
Committee representative will
determine who wins those
posts, but Robert Willis has
already. locked up the position
of freshman class vice presi-
dent.

Peter Eliades and Dutch
Waldbauer will run off for presi-
dent and Joseph Sloboda and
Christopher Gammon will vie
for the one freshman E.C. slot.

Willis won the position of vice
president outright by polling
over 50 per cent of the 244 votes
cast during Monday’s election.
He received 146 votes, or ap-
proximately 60 per cent of the
votes cast. His closest
challenger, Robert Neily
received 64 votes. Joseph
Robles had 34.

Eliades and Waldbauer
became contenders for the
presidency of the freshman
class by virtue of the fact they
received more votes than the
other five candidates. Neither
of them, however, received a
majority of the 245 votes cast.
Waldbauer was the leading
vote-getter with 65. Eliades had
45 votes cast for him. Jamie
Small was close to making the
runn-off with 35 votes, but Sam
Campbell, Marc Firestone and
J. Scott Corduzo with 29 and
John Schmidt with 13 votes fell
well behind.

In the E.C. elections, Gam-
mon made it into the runn-offs

by a mile, while Slaboda made
it by a nose. Gammon received
77 of the 244 votes cast.
Although this only represents
approximately 30 per cent of the
votes cast, Gammon. still
received almost double the
amount of votes as Slaboda,
who had 40. Slaboda just eked it
out over Robert Brooke, who
had 35 votes. Rounding out the
large E.C. aspirants were Steve

Christovich, 23. votes; Chip

he did not want to speculate on
the Faculty E. C. recommenda-

Atwood added that if the pre-

schedule is done away with it
would only mean exams would
be scheduled, not proctored.

Questions the Faculty E.C.
asked of faculty members
were:

1) Were you a _ faculty
member at Washington and Lee

before the independent ex-
amination schedule was
adopted?

2) Are you basically in favor
of continuing the independent
examination schedule?

3) Do you have personal, first-
hand knowledge of specific in-
cidences in which information
about an examination was
revealed to those who had not
taken it or who might take it?

4) Do you have any indirect,
second-hand knowledge of such
incidences? .

Underhill said he thought tur-

the turnout today would be bet-

Potter Says:

 

Two Ariels will come out

by Lee Howard

Ariel, Washington & Lee’s
student literary magazine, is
going to be fresh, exciting and
it’s going to come out two times
this year, editor Parker Potter
said in an interview yesterday.

Skeptics on the Executive
Committee gave Ariel only
enough money to put out one
issue, telling Potter to come
back when he can “‘prove’’ he
can put out another issue. Pot-
ter said he will be back, and
sooner than the E.C. thinks. He
said he hopes Ariel will come
out by early December, but is
putting the ‘realistic’ target
date at the first day of the
winter term, in January.

Potter said he shouldn’t have
to ‘“‘prove’’ anything. Although
in recent years the Ariel has on-
ly come out once a year,
previous to that the Ariel had
come out three and even five
times a year. He said he will be

able to fill up two issues “‘even if. ; *
I have to fill the second” <
myself.” Potter said the reason. —
he is worried about the: —

Stipulated “‘proof” is that he
might have to do two-thirds of
the work on the second issue
before he finds out whether he’ll
get the money for it. He pointed
out no other student organiza-
tion has to do this in order to
secure funds.

Potter said he believes the
whole process involved in
securing E. C. funds is too
‘‘protracted.”” He said the fact
that he didn’t know how much
money he was going to be given
until Oct. 10 will delay the first
issue of Ariel because, even
after all the material has been
gathered, it takes a month of
preparation before Ariel goes to
the printer.

periences with the following:
a) exams turned in with the

question sheets missing?

b) grades increase as ex-
ams proceed?

c) answers that are
suspiciously similar?

d) any other experience?

Originally, the independent
exam schedule was initated in
the 1970-1971 school year along
with the present curriculum.
When the independent exam
schedule was initiated there
was a large minority that voted
against its installment. This
minority thought that indepen-
dent exams put too much strain
on the honor code, and therefore
weakened it. Three years after
its conception the faculty voted
to retain independent exams.
Questions about the security of
the independent exam schedule
were first voiced last spring.
The matter was raised again
this term and the faculty E.C.
was asked to circulate its peti-
tion.

Potter said he is hoping
poems in the Ariel will contain
more social commentary. This
has been difficult in the past
because W&L is such a tradi-
tional school, he said. In any
case, Potter said he doesn’t
really go for ‘‘Moon and June
type things.’’ He said he was
also interested in seeing
satirical works. In addition he
would like to see short stories,
short essays, character sket-
ches and dramatic situations,
possibly excerpts from a play.
Potter emphaized these must be
short because of the limited
space in Ariel.

One possibility . for Ariel,
which Potter said he found par-
ticularly exciting, would be to
print an issue revolving around
a central theme, but taken from
different angles.. Potter said
this possibility would come to
light in the second issue, if some
sort of unity could be maintain-
ed with his writers.

Unity was the main theme of
his organizational scheme.
Rather than having his con-
tributers leave their poems in
some box in the library, Potter
said he wants to meet them
face-to-face. The organizational
meeting yesterday (too late for
the Phi to cover) was an at-

by Rex Nyquist

Last Thursday night two
speeches were given and a
debate was held on campus. In
Lee Chapel, Contact ‘78 kicked
off its program with Sir Robert
Mark. The Journalism depart-
ment presented John Merrill in
duPont, while the debate team
argued Oxford University’s
squad in the Moot Court Room
in Lewis Hall.

The scheduling left some peo-
ple asking: ‘‘Why were three
events held on the same
night?”’

It now seems, however, that
there was little that could be
done about it. All three events
were arranged separately, and
in each case the W&L Contact
had little say in the arrange-
ment.

Professor Jennings of the
journalism department said of
the Merrill speech: ‘‘Merrill is
one of the speakers of the
Visiting Scholars of Virginia
program. We had little say in
the scheduling of the speech.”

The speech, scheduled in mid-
September, had to be on the
date the Visiting Scholars Pro-
gram assigned the school if they
wanted him to speak. There
were about 125 people at the
speech. Jennings estimated
that about half of them were re-
quired to attend for classes.

The debate was also schedul-
ed by an outside agency.
Halford Ryan, coach of the
team, said that the debate was
arranged in late August. The
Speech Commonwealth
Association (the liason for the
British team) sent Ryan a ques-
tionnaire asking if he would like

to have the debaters, and if so,

tempt to do so. Potter said he
hopes to make these meetings a
regular thing. He also said
seminars in which contributors
make critical suggestions for
other writers to improve their
work would be a possibility.

Potter said he will be working
closely with Dabney Stuart, a
professor and creative writing
teacher in the English depart-
ment, who has contacts with the
school’s creative writers. He
said he will also be working
closely with Chris Volk, whom
he recently appointed as
photography editor.
Photography is a major part of
Ariel’s presentation, and Volk,
as former editor of the Calyx,
has contacts with most of
W&L/’s finest picture takers.

Potter summarized the up-
coming year for Ariel by saying
that the first issue must come
out early so it will be placed in
the ‘‘public conscienceness.”
The second issue is ‘‘going to be
the exciting one,’’ he said. This
is the one he considers to be his
baby. The first one will basical-
ly be put out to satisfy the E.C.
The second one will aim for.
some larger design of literary
quality within each selection
and thematic quality within the
entire context of the Ariel.

when he would like to have
them.

However, Ryan said, the
ultimate choice was made by
the Association, and he had to
take or leave the date he got.
About 25 people attended the
debate. Dr. Ryan said that he
was not aware that Contact had
scheduled a presentation for the
same evening.

Washers Broken

by Jim Ingham

The laundry service offered
to freshmen in the basement of
Graham-Lees Dorm will be im-
proved. Plans are being made
to add security to the room, to
educate the students on how to
use the washers and dryers
more efficiently, and, ultimate-
ly to add more machines. Jerry
Darrell, in charge of this ser-
vice as well as the University
food services, said that if he had
his way, the above plans will be
implemented after a freshman

Disorganization in scheduling

Meanwhile, Sir Robert Mark
spoke to about 200 people in Lee
Chapel. Contact co-chairman
Billy Webster said that Mark
was signed last April through
Lordly Dame, Inc. Contact had
a choice of twelve dates to have
him. They received last Thurs-
day, apparently because Mark
was scheduled to speak at the
College of William and Mary on
Friday night.

Thus, it seems like the
scheduling of three cratorical
events on the same night was an
unfortunate coincidence. At
least nobody can complain that
there was nothing to do.

steering committee is formed
and decides on the specifics of
how the new operation will be
run.

The washers and dryers in the
Graham-Lee Dorm _ have
always been a source of discon-
tent among freshmen. The main
problem is that four washers
and four dryers are just not
enough for the number of
students who need to use them.
One freshman noted that the
number of machines is so inade-
quate that ‘you sometimes
have to do your wash in the mid-
dle of the night.’’ This causes a
good number of people to look
for somewhere else to do their
wash.

Another problem voiced is
that the dryers take two or
three quarters to do a load of
wash. Not only does this make
the service more expensive and
time consuming but it also
means that less people have a
chance to get their clothes done.
The dryers have also been
plagued by such things as
broken doors and the washers
have in the past skipped the
rinse cycle.

Darrell attributes these pro-
blems to a lot of factors. He
acknowledged that there is in-
deed a need for more washers
and dryers. But as for the quali-
ty of the equipment, he pointed
to the fact that these machines
are misused a lot of time. He
stated that a maximum load of

October 20. On the election
front, another motion limiting
campaign spending to five
dollars and media exposure to
twenty posters passed with one
dissenting vote. Law School
representative Rick Goddard,
speaking on behalf of his vote
against the motion, quipped
that there was ‘“‘too much trash

on this campus already.”
Moving beyond regular
business, president Jim

Underhill spoke of the present
dichotomy of opinion between
the faculty and the Executive
Committee in regards to in-
dependent exams. Underhill in-
dicated in his speech that time
was running out on the E.C. and
that the committee would soon
have to take a stand. Underhill
pointed out that the faculty felt
that its role in the Exam pro-
cess was ambiguous. In noting
the faculty desire for added
specificity, the president
discussed two hypothetical
situations where rigid pro-
cedure could help: exams hand-
ed in late and finals taken in
another building such as the
Library. Presently there is no
set punishment for these of-
fenses.

At this point, Griffin added

that the situation of Indepen-
dent Exams would not be fully
known until the results of a
faculty poll conducted by the
Faculty Executive Committee
were tabulated. Griffin also
spoke of the concern expressed
to him by many faculty
members that freshmen did not
know the proper pledge. Griffin
continued by saying that faculty
members speculated that this
lack of knowledge on the part of
the freshmen might be a result
of a breakdown in the orienta-
tion process at Natural Bridge.
At the request of Griddwn, the
correct pledge is:
”’On my honour, I have neither
given nor received any
unacknowledged aid on this
exam, (test or paper).”’

The irony of this part of the
meeting lay in the fact that,
when asked by an uninformed
sophomore in the audience for
the official pledge, none of the
eleven members could recite it.
But the vice president joked,
“the problem is whether or not
the E goes before the I in receiv-
ed.”’

 

Trussell

chosen...

 

The final topic of the night
was the selection of the Univer-
sity Center Committee chair-
man. The duties of the U.C.C.
entail the maintenance of the
University Center Library and
Fairfax Lounge and the super-
vision of Cockpit entertain-
ment. The only two applicants
were Tony Carli and Galen
Trussell, both members of the
Student Activities Board.

In his testimony, Carli, but-
tressed by S.A.B. co-chairman
Charlie Hulfish, said he could
be a good liaison between the
S.A.B.,secthe Cockpit, and
W&L Student Music Union.

Carli, applying for the job at the
request of S.A.B. secretary
Tom McCarthy, stated that with
the present budget only two acts
per week were feasible. The
aspiring sophomore also took a
strong stand against any cover
charge to counteract the fiscal
strain of an expensive act say-
ing, “it seems ridiculous to
charge students for something
they’ve already paid.’’ Carli
saw no reason not to permit
‘Veemees’ to use the Cockpit.

Trussell, stating his case, an-
nounced that he wanted to exer-.
cise creativity for cockpit enter-
tainment. Trussell continued by
saying that, as a_ present
member of the Student Ac-
tivities Board and the Student
Music Union, he could supply
the initiative, the knowledge,
and the energy necessary to im-
plement his innovative ideas on
Cockpit entertainment. The
Trussell plan called for four or
five high quality weekend acts
during the year with the rest of
the entertainment being sup-
plied gratuitously by perform-
ing members of the Student
Music Union. Trussell further
testified that he had prior ex-
perience in booking bands for
different engagements and that
as the lone eagle on the S.A.B.,
his usefulness was being wasted
because of personal
“animosities” on that commit-
tee and constant degradation of
his unique viewpoint. This
adverse situation on the S.A.B.,
claimed Trussell mostly ex-
plained his rather sketchy at-
tendance record at S.A.B.
meetings as compared with
Carli’s impeccable record to
date.

As soon as the two applicants
stepped out of the room to await
the results, committee discus-
sion began to flow. Doug
Perkins opened by saying that
Trussell would be an asset to
the U.C.C. for his connections
with the Student Music Union;
an advantage Carli lacked.
Rick Goddard foll owed
Perkins’ lead that Galen
Trussell, although lacking in
areas of the U.C.C. outside of
the entertainment sector, would
be ‘important to see the music
thing off the ground.” S.A.B. co-
chairman Hulfish, openly favor-
ing Carli, reminded the E.C.
that the job they were debating
required a “vigilant worker”’
willing to show up every day.

Then Neil Pentifallo raised
the question of the disparity of
the performance records of the
two applicants, feeling that past
facts and actions argued in
favour of Carli. Steve Abraham
snapped back that, based on
S.A.B. meetings he attended
last year, “the meetings are
ridiculous.” Abraham em-
phasized his empathy for
Trussell in his abortive efforts
to bring a dimension of diversi-
ty to the musical entertainment
on the W&L campus. Junior
representative Jack Bovay, a .
staunch Carli supporter, felt
that, “Tony is much more
responsible” in carrying out all
of the duties inherent in the job.

Mike Missal backed up Bovay
by pointing out that, to be suc-
cessful, the U.C.C. chairman
would have to have good rela-
tions and strong ties with the
S.A.B. and that Trussell; given
his past experiences with the
Hulfish crew, would have a
great deal of difficulty sustain-
ing either.

Sophomore E.C. member An-
dy Bodenstab tried, in a brief
and futile effort, to propose a
con. promise of having Carli and
Trussel serve as co-chairmen.
The Bodenstab solution called
for the best of both applicants;
the musical connections of
Galen combined with Tony’s

unblemished feliability for the
day-to-day operation of the
University Center.

Vice president’ Griffin
favored Trussell’s appointment
on the rationale that Trussel
could be more useful as the
U.C.C. chairman than as a
frustrated radical on the S.A.B.
Jim Underhill closed the debate
by stating that, although ‘‘Tony
is better in the other aspects,”
that Trussell was the better
choice because he could act as a
“bigger mediary between the
two groups,” (the Student
Music Union and the University
Center Committee). Underhill
concluded on Trussell’s behalf,
“T think we really need the

abstentions to accept the ap-

Tracy, Hepburn, and the
‘Great American Movie Buff’

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor

Of all the types of people in
this world of ours, with all their
divergent interests, the one cult
which has always had a special
appeal for me is the “movie
buff.’’ For those of us who have
some right to claim the title, it
is cherished almost as identity
card—and with good reason.
There really aren’t that many
movie buffs in the classic sense
roaming about.

With all due respect, those of
you who have seen The Sound of
Music five times simply don’t
qualify, despite arguments to
the contrary. The real movie
buff may be recognized by a
more in-depth knowledge, such
as knowing the answers to the
folldwing: How many parts
does Frank Morgan play, aside
from the Wizard, in The Wizard
of Oz? What was the first real
“‘all-star’’ movie? (Hint: it was
Best Picture in its year of
release) Who played Lola in
The Blue Angel?What actress
brought movie censorship into
being almost totally as a result
of her bawdy one-liners? For
what film did Bogart receive his
only Oscar? On and on and on
they go...

Yes, the movie buff is a rare
combination of steadfast devo-
tion and unflagging energy. He
is the type whose favorite view-
ing hours on the tube are bet-
ween 11 and 4 in the morning.
You find him clustered in a
small group watching James
Gagney and Jean Harlow, while
the majority make do with the
network offerings. Or in the
front row of the local ‘‘revival-
house,”’ existing on stale pop-
corn and flat orangeade. He
generally knows the screenplay
of Casablanca by heart, and

never mentions Gone With the
Wind except with eyes raised to
heaven, or body bowed towards
Mecca.

It is this vary group of people
that the SAB is catering to this
weekend, a fairly ‘“‘off’’ one in
most other respects. The SAB
movie this week is a classic:
State of the Union, directed by
Frank Capra, starring
Katharine Hepburn and
Spencer Tracy. The place for
the vintage 1948 flick is duPont
auditorium, at 7 & 9 Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday. The
cost—a mere dollar.

Tracy and Hépburn— pro-
bably the team of all Hollywood
dramatic teams. In their nine
films together, they achieved a
consistent level’ of excellence,
wit, and appeal rarely matched.
They were indeed a good reflec-
tion of the overall grandeur of
their home studio, MGM, which
was the king of them all through
the movies’ golden age. MGM,
quite simply, had the best of
everything, and more of it than
anyone else! Astaire, Kelly,
Sinatra, Gable, Garland...they
all called it home. But none
were as highly acclaimed as
these two.

Friends on and off the set,
they were two divergent per-
sonalities. Hepburn was (and
still is) the creative foun-
tainhead, bursting with ideas,
who loves nothing more than
directing the director. Tracy,
calm and so realistic that he
seemed to ‘walk through a
scene the way he walks through
life,” was often considered the
greatest of them all by his
peers.

Conflicts were often
unavoidable between the two.
As Stanley Kramer once
related, ‘‘She will constantly ex-
amine the material for that lit-

Eye and Ear:
from the Bookstore

Three new and hot releases on
the music scene this fall are
Randy Newman’s Little
Criminals, Jean-Luc Ponty’s
Enigmatic Ocean, and Tom
Waits’ Foreign Affairs. All
three of these records show
these musicians moving again
in the directions that made
them famous.

Newman’s Little Criminals is
the first thing from the
singer/songwriter since Good
Old Boys some 3!,years ago. It
has been worth the wait. Per-
sonnel featured on the album in-
clude Joe Walsh and a good
many of the Eagles. The songs
range from tunes with a sense
of humor to chillingly melodic
social criticism (Baltimore is
an example of this). If you’re an
old Newman fan this is a must.
And if you’ve never heard of
him now is the time to listen.

Tom Waits’ new Foreign Af-

 

fairs, his follow-up to the
critically acclaimed Small
Change, features Waits’
wonderful raspy voice doing
more sad songs in bars. The
overall effect is something like
a cross between Randy
Newman and Louis Armstrong
with three bottles of Jack
Daniels thrown in. Very ex-
citing and listenable with occa-
sional passages which make
you sigh, “I’ve been there.”’

Which brings us to Jean-Luc
Ponty. Violin Virtuoso Ponty
continues his jazz spectrum in
Enigmatic Ocean in much the
same manner as on last year’s
Imag-nary Voyage. The free
flowing progressive sound is
there as usual and as usual Pon-
ty is always right on top of
things. The overall sound is
strong, very strong, and invites
aural exploration. Highly
recommended.

tle piece of something that will
bring it alive or make it funnier
or more poignant.’’ That is, un-
til Tracy, the original one-take
actor, has his fill, and snaps,
“Why don’t you just mind your
own damn business, read the
lines, do what he says, and let’s
get on with it?” Hepburn may
have bristled for a moment at
this, but it always ended in a
good-natured laugh. And “‘get
on with it’’ they did indeed...

State of the Union, though
made almost thirty years ago,
is a movie timeless in its
theme—political ambition.
Tracy plays the part of a man
who is manuevered into the
Republican nomination for
President. Hepburn is his
estranged wife who returns to
him to improve the electoral
chances. The film shows Tracy, -
under the influence of the usual
backers, sacrificing all his prin-
ciples to his ambition. But the
ever-inventive Hepburn as the
wife, seeing her husband’s
state, moves full steam ahead
to save him, in spite of himself.
The result is a wise, witty, and
thoroughly enjoyable show.

The critics of 1948 hailed the
film as a “triumph.” But the
game of politics is still the
Ssame—only the names
change—andState of the Union
still has a moral to give us, no
doubt.

State of the Union is the pro-
duct of many talented people,
not least director Capra. One of
the few directors, like DeMille
or Hitchcock, who had a fan
following similar to the stars,
Capra was also one of the
greatest egotists in the
business. In this film, his name
not only appears before the two
stars, but before the title!

Even so, we always come
back to the easy styles of Tracy
and Hepburn. One thing that I
think we all marvel about in
their movies is the seeming lack
of effort it took to produce such
a great film. And it was just
that to them—easy. Spencer
Tracy’s comments serve as a
fine conclusion:

“I don’t like anything about
acting. But I did very well by it.
It’s never been very deman-
ding. It doesn’t require much
brainwork. Acting is not the
noblest profession in the world,
but there are things lower than
acting — not many, mind you —
but politicians give you
something to look down on from
time to time.”

(Note: For the curious, the
answers to those questions
above were 4 or 5, Grand Hotel,
Marlene Dietrich, Mae West,
and The African Queen...)

THE NOSE KNOWS

Well here goes, let’s see how
much trouble I can get myself
into this week. I realize that I
have been given ghe E’s a hard
time. Granted they deserve it
but I think its time I lay off
them. For god’s sake some peo-
ple were beginning to think I
was black.

We have reason to believe
that a certain member of the
E.C. who last year said he
would pay his own way to the
E.C. party has yet to do so.

A certain member of the
Athletic staff was said to have
made some very damaging
statements about the editor of
the Phi. It’s a shame we
couldn’t print them. Matter of
fact, why couldn’t we?

While we are on the subject of
harmful statements is it true

that a certain member of the
alumni office has been accused
of Dirty Rushing several frater-

_nities this summer. I think

before certain administrative
officials start chastising year-
book editors for printing
degrading pictures of their
fraternity they best clean up
their own offices.

Baldwin’s Apple Day was
another flop. Wahoos galore. I
think Baldwin is the only one of
the girls schools that tries to
make money off of their social
functions.

The first clue on Fancy Drunk
theme—It’s not of the western
hemisphere and the invitations
will be written on a strange
form of paper.

Musical Mainstream

by Mark Mainwaring
and Ward Boult

Live albums used to be pro-
duced sparingly, primarily as
an inexpensive, almost ef-
fortless way for an artist or
band to keep their fans happy
between studio releases. Ever
since the phenomenal success
ofFrampton Comes Alive,
though, live albums have pro-
liferated almost ad nauseum,
released mostly by _lesser-
known bands hoping to make
their own Frampton-like
breakthrough. This week in
Mainstream, we’ll review two
of the more interesting recent
live LPs.

Love You Live
Rolling Stones
Rolling Stones Records
COC 2-9001

Recorded in Paris and Toron-
to in 1976-77, Love You Live is
the second live album released
by the Rolling Stones. And
whether you compare it to the
band’s first live LP (Get Yer
Ya-Ya’s Out) or with recent live
releases by other groups, the
record is a disappointment. For
most of the Paris concert
(which takes up three sides of
the album), the Stones seem to
be simply going through the mo-
tions. The instrumental work,
for the most part, is good and
nothing more, and Mick Jag-
ger’s vocals range from
mediocre to just plain sloppy.

Side three of Love You Live,
recorded at the El Macambo
club in Toronto, is a different
story. After years of playing in
stadiums and hockey arenas,
the Stones finally go back to
their beginnings on this side of
the album, both physically
(playing to a small audience)
and musically (playing blues-
based rock). The members of
the band are quite obviously en-
joying themselves, and the in-

timate feeling of this part of the
album (especially after the
remoteness of the other three
sides) nearly redeems_ the
whole record, but can’t quite
pull it off. By nearly every ac-
count, the Rolling Stones are in-
credibly good in concert, and
it’s too bad their onstage energy
didn’t survive the transfer to
vinyl. Love You Live seems to
be a classic case of ‘‘you had to
be there.”

Night After Night
Nils Lofgren
A&M SP-3707

If you were a bit worried
about Nils Lofgren after hear-
ing his last album, fear not. Nils
is back, and this time he is live
and kickin’.

Amidst the avalanche of dou-
ble live albums, Night After
Night comes as a fresh sur-
prise. The album was recorded
during 1977 at the
Hammersmith-London,
England, the Apollo Theater-
Glasgow, Scotland, and the
Roxy in Los Angeles. The band
(essentially the same that
played on I Came to Dance) is
exceptional: Nils Lofgren-lead
guitar and vocals, Tom
Lofgren-guitar (yes, they’re
brothers), Wornell ‘‘Sonic
Prince’ Jones-bass_ guitar,
Reverend Patrick Henderson-
piano and organ, and David
Patshon on drums. The
material on the album was all
wirtten by Nils Lofgren-some
new, some old. Recent tunes in-
clude “‘Cry Tough,”’ ‘‘It’s Not a
Crime,’ ‘‘Incidentally...It’s
Over,”’ ‘‘Code of the Road,”’ and
“I Came to Dance.’ Also
featured are a few songs from
Lofgren’s old band, Grin.

Night After Night is chock full
of Lofgren’s special brand of
rock and roll. His music is sum-
med up in the lyrics “I ain’t no

the album is typical Lofgren—
he wrenches it out no matter

The album does have its weak
points (background vocals, for
example), but these are easily

Guitarist Excels In Lee Chapel

by Robert Tremblay

Throughout the history of
music, the classical guitar has
been, for the most part, un-
fortunately neglected. The
reasons for this could be due to
the ‘beliefs’ that the guitar
does not display the bravura of
a piano or the graceful singing
style of a violin, the piano and
the violin beging two of the
more popular solo instruments.
But one only had to hear Peter
Corey Tuesday night at Lee
Chapel to realize that these
‘‘beliefs’’ are unsubstantiated.

Mr. Corey’s brilliant guitar
work exhibited in some parts of
his program a flamboyance
usually only associated with the
piano, and in others, a cantabile
character found more typically
in the violin. His technique, his
feeling for the instrument, his
interpretations all displayed a
maturity of style not usually
associated with a performer so
young (Mr. Corey is only 19).
His scalar passages were in-
credibly smoth, his counter-
point clear, but what was even
more impressive was Mr. Cor-
ey’s apparent ease in publishing
these technically demanding
areas. His concert was, in a
word, spectacular.

It would be pointless for me to
comment on each work as far as
quality is concerned because I’d
be using the same superlative in
almost every case: excellent.
But these pieces deserve men-
tion anyways for they show the
variety of style that Mr. Corey’s
concert displayed. The Weiss
Lute Suite No. 4in G opened the
program. It is a charming
piece, but more importantly, it
allowed Mr. Corey a chance to
immediately exhibit the grace
and technical ability of the
classical guitar. The Chaconne
by Bach was originally written

Christmas Special, taped short-
ly before Crosby’s recent death.
The two singers will team up on
several songs, including a ren-
dition of ‘“‘Litthke Daummer
Boy” (?!)....0n the local
scene, WLUR’s ‘90 Minutes
With...”’ will begin a new season
next Thursday, Oct. 27, at 10:30
p.m. “90 Minutes with Alice
Cooper” will feature an ex-
clusive phone interview with
Alice himself, plus plenty of
good music. Future shows will
focus on Emerson Lake &
Palmer, Chris deBurgh, and a
host of others....Finally, the sta-
tion has received some ex-
cellent entries in the “Design a
WLUR Logo” contest. The con-
test winner will receive his or
her choice of one of the follow-
ing double albums:
ELP—Works, Volume 1, Elvis

for the violin, but the rapid runs
and trills in it were superbly
handled. The Sor Fantasia No.
1, Op. 7 was another piece that
would put to rest the idea that
the guitar lacks the technical
prowess of the piano. Many
large intervallic leaps and
tricky finger work highlight this
piece. The Fandanguillo by
Turina brought to the
foreground the different tone
coloring that the guitar is
capable of. By tapping the str-
ings of the guitar with the palm
of his hand (the technique is
called tambora). Mr. Corey ef-
fectively produced the variety
of sound that Turina was in-
terested in. The Sonatina by
Berkeley was written for the
guitar virtuoso Julian Bream,
but Mr. Corey performed the
composition with a flair almost
suggesting that the piece was
written for him. The concert
was concluded with a Canzonet-
ta by Mendelssohn, which was
originally written for string

RING-TUM PHI

Soccer Team

Lynched

by Chris Fay

The soccer team lost to Lyn-
chburg Saturday. Lynchburg
won 5 to 0, they piled up 4 goals
in the first half. The Generals
have lost the last three games
on the road.

Four goals were scored in the
first half against the Generals.
The first goal was on a Lyn-
chburg penalty kick. The
Generals set up their defensive
wall, Kevin Carney waited at
the far side of the net. But the
scorer shot the ball over the
fullbacks and the side of the net
away from Carney into the goal.

On the second goal, the Lyn-
chburg player shot on Carney.
He stretched himself out in time
to stop the shot, but couldn’t
control the ball. The shooter ran
in to kick the ball further from
Carney, then he pushed it in.

On the third Lynchburg goal
the player dribbled past the
Generals’ fullbacks and suc-
cessfully shot on goal.

The fourth goal scored by a
Lynchburg player involved
pushing one of the Generals off
the ball from behind. Then he
kicked the ball in to score.

In the second half the
Generals tryed to regain
themselves. The last goal was

on a penalty shot against the
Generals. The scorer drilled it
by Carney to score.

The Generals played badly in
the first half, but came back to
allow only one Lynchburg goal
in the second half. A week of
practice without a game might
have hurt the Generals.

Back Into Top Ten

by Lee Howard

What do you do against a
team that is bigger, stronger,
faster and meaner than you?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Washington and Lee satisfied
that prophesy Saturday,
managing a grand total of 10
yards on 35 carries as the
Hampden-Sydney Tigers
demolished them 49-0.

The Tigers scored on their
first seven possessions, inspired
by the fact that they had been
dropped from No. 7 on the
NCAA Division III poll to mere-
ly honorable mention. H-S was
nearly perfect in rolling up a
35-0 halftime lead, insuring
W&L’s sixth straight loss. The
closest the Generals got to scor-
ing was in the fourth quarter

Water Polo Team Loses Up North;
No Post Season Play For W&L

by Jim Barnes

‘‘We were blown out of the
pool,” according to water polo
coach Bill Stearns, refering to
last weekend’s trip up to the
Northeast. The Generals lost all
four of their conference games
and with that any chance of post
season play in the Middle Atlan-
tic Conference. Had _ the
Generals managed to win over
out of the four contests they
would have gone to the Middle
Atlantic Tournament at West
Point.

The team went up to Universi-
ty Park Pensylvania Friday for
their first game in a confident
frame of mind on the merits of
their early season _ per-
formance. But confidence
wasn't enough to stop a quicker
and more experienced Penn
State team. This was a problem
the team faced the entire
weekend.

‘“Speedwise,”’ said Stearns,
“‘T know we have as good swim-
mers as any of the ofher teams

in our conference. But we just
don’t have the quickness, or
reactions that the more ex-
perienced teams have.’’ The
failure of the team can be at-
tributed to W&L’s inability to
react as well as the other teams
in the league to penalty whistles
and flags.

On Saturday the team travel-
ed to New York to face Slippery
Rock in the morning and Col-
umbia and Villanova in the
afternoon. In each game the
Generals reduced their losing
margin. They were walloped in
their first match against Slip-
pery Rock 17-5, lost by nine
points to Columbia 18-9 and
were barely beaten’ by
Villanova, losing 13-10.

“I think we should have won
the game against Villanova,”’
said Stearns. He feels that had
the team played Villanova first
when they were confident and
not so tired they would have
won the game. ‘‘We’re going to
emphasize fundamentals in

practice these next few weeks.
That’s the only way you can
compensate for a iack of speed.
You’ve got to play good fun-
damental water polo if you
aren’t quick.”

Right now the team is looking
forward to the state champion-
ships that will be played at the
Cy Twombly Pool in Doremus
Gymnasium during parents’
weekend. Stearns believes that
his team has a better chance to

en
lin cial a 5 LO BT aS

when they managed to get to the
three yard line, only to give up
the ball on downs.

The Tigers didn’t go to their
scrubs until the score was 42-0.
That fact, plus the fact H-S tried
some razzle-dazzle, like a fake
punt and a halfback touchdown
pass, made some persons ac-
cuse the Tigers of running up
the score to get back in the top
10. W&L assistant coaches
chewed out H-S head coach
Stokely Fulton for those plays.
H-S also chose to go for first
downs rather than field goals on
three different occasions. The
three plays led to two
touchdowns.

The first score was on a
fourth-and-eight, Tiger quarter-
back Dale Marks threading the
needle for a:13 yard pass to Ben
Newell. The second touchdown
was scored after the Tigers
went for a fourth-and-three on
the 16 and a fourth-and-one on
the goal line.

The Tigers ran up a total of
427 yards to 137 for W&L. H-S
had almost three times as many
plays as the Generals, grinding
out 81 plays to W&L’s 31. The
best way to describe the Tigers
scoring plays is to say they had
seven of them and none of them
were done the same way.

The Generals, showing an
eight man line just about the
whole game, were burned by
the pass. Eleven different
Tigers caught passes, while H-S
quarterbacks connected on 19 of
28 passes for 251 yards.

The Tigers even got lucky.
When halfback Bill Moore
fumbled in the W&L endzone,
guard Skip Sudduth fell on it for
a touchdown.

Scott Swope, the Generals’
junior quarterback, was the on-
ly bright spot. He threw for 100
yards on a six for fourteen ef-
fort. Ted Hissey completed
three of five but for only 30
yards. W&L quarterbacks had
it tough, though, being sacked
for 59 yards in losses.

The Tigers’ win keeps them in
first place in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference at 2-0. The
Generals are 0-2 in the ODAC.
They go against the University
of the South, better known as
Sewanee, Saturday. The
Generals won last year’s con-
test 16-14. Sewanee graduated
15 starters from last year’s 5-4
team and are presently 1-4.
Sewanee will be trying to even
the series of the long-time
rivalry at 13-13. Their nickname
is also the Tigers. No relation,
we hope.

‘Cross Country

Distant Second

by Clem Carter

Washington and Lee’s Cross
Country team split a three way
meet in Bridgewater last Fri-
day. Bridgewater, described by
Coach Miller as a ‘“‘strong”
team took first place with just
17 points. The Generals were a
distant second with 48 points,
Roanoke was third with a point
total of 72.

Bridgewater, led by Curt
Rowland, took five of the top six
places, sweeping the first three.
Rowland ran the 8000 meter
course in 25 minutes and 55
seconds, Allen Weeks was the
top General. de took fourth
place overall. Weeks was slight-
ly under a minute off the winn-
ing pace with a time of 26
minutes and 50 seconds. The se-
cond Washington and Lee run-
ner was Chris Daniels, He took

Final action is set for 1:30 p.m.
on Saturday when W&L and
Maryland play at W&L, and

Virginia and Ohio play at VMI.
Bussard lists UVa as the
favorite with the remaining
three teams all having a shot at
the title. This is the W&L
team’s final action of the fall
(continued on page 7)

minutes and 19 seconds. Bob
Bates followed in ninth place
with a time of 27 minutes and 28
seconds. The fourth and fifth
men for Washington and Lee
were Brian Adams and Richard
Bird, respectively. They finish-
ed 13th and 14th overall with
times of 28 minutes, two
seconds and 28 minutes 24
seconds. Kevin Grimm and Bill
Welch were 15th and 17th to
close out the top seven men for
the Generals.

Coach Miller would give no
excuses for Washington and
Lee’s defeat in a meet which
one runner described as ‘‘mild-
ly disappointing.’’ Miller sum-
med the meet up by saying:
“We didn’t run well.’’ The
Generals’ record now stands at
nine wins and three loses. They
are two wins and two loses in

the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference.

Washington and Lee is open
this coming week. An op-
portunity which Coach Miller
will use to take the team to
Roanoke College on Saturday to
run the course that will be used
for the ODAC meet on
November 5th. The next time
the Generals will run will be in
Lexington on October 29th
against powerful James
Madison University and
Eastern Mennonite.

Frats Too Rough

 

I-M Football Out of Hand

by Jim Barnes

Apparently unnecessary
roughness is not limited to the
NHL or the NFL, but is also an
element of the W&L IM football
program. Whether it is the lack
of competent officials, or over
zealous jocks, there has been an
increased incidence of injuries
in IM football this year over
years past.

IM faculty advisor Verne
Canfield says, ‘‘We can’t get
enough competent officials to
call the games.’’ Each
organization that fields a team
is also supposed to provide a
‘competent official for another
game. The official gets two
dollars for every game he calls.
The IM office attempted to hold
clinics for the. prospective of-
ficials to point out to them the
penalties that frequently occur
in IM football. Unfortunatly
these clinics were not well at-
tended. When you have a foot-
ball game that is being
carelessly officiated there’s a
good chance that the game can
get out of control.

Canfield says that it’s come to
his attention that some
organizations ‘‘have taken ad-
vantage of the situation. Some
organizations are forgetting the
spirit of IM’s.” He threatens to
“nail the particular frats if it

continues,”’ or to ‘‘cancel the IM
football program.”

Several IM officials substan-
tiate the reports of increased
roughness on the IM field. One
official stated, ‘‘Some frats are
getting out of control.”’ Another
official said,’ ‘‘There’re ex-
jocks who are playing like they
used to on Saturday after-
noons.”” The organizations
whose names consistently came
up when violence is mentioned
are Fiji, Sae, and PhiPsi. It
seems that the Fijis in par-
ticular are the roughest. In
games that they have played in
several opponents have receiv-
ed bloddy noses, and one player
had his shoulder seperated in a
game.

Fiji President Charlie Brown
denied that his team players
were ‘dirty, or cheap shot ar-
tists.” Brown said, ‘‘When
you’ve got automatic rush,
some ex-football players on
your team, and poor officials,
an IM football game is going to
be rough. Brown denies that
any injuries sustained whil
playing the Fijis were the
results of rough play on the Fi-
ji’s part. Brown believes that if
the officials would do their job
and control the game there
would be no problems.

$3.5 Million Gym
to be dedicated

In Lexington this Friday,
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s Board of Trustees will of-
ficially dedicate the new $3.25-
million addition to W&L’s gym-
nasium facilities.

The 100,000-sqaure-foot ex-
pansion will be named for
Jonathan W. “Jack” Warner, a
graduate of W&L and now a
member of the Board of
Trustees, Warner is the presi-
dent and chairman of the board
of ‘‘Gulf States Paper Corpora-
tion’’ in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

The ceremony is set for 5 p.m.
W&L’s trustees will be holding

   

their autumn board meeting on
the campus Friday and Satur-
day, and the dedication will
take place as part of those ac-
tivities.

The gym expansion contains
a 2,500-seat basketball arena; a
regulation-size swimming pool
with a balcony for 500 spec-
tators; a wrestling room; ten
courts for handball, paddleball
and squash; physical education
classrooms; training and equip-
ment rooms; and _ locker
facilities for every indoor sport,
and for general student and
faculty use.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Where credit is due

It is indeed a lamentable occasion when one must
praise the government on its handling of issues. One
hates to give the government credit for anything
good, but sometimes it is unavoidable. Some people
try to avoid praising the government by saying it is
not the government that deserves the praise, but
rather the people working in the government. The
“government” remains the mysterious evil menace it
has always been; it’s just that a different and better
group of people control it.

To apply this discussion to the Washington and Lee
community would have seemed ludicrous in the past.
It was a commonly held belief that the E.C. was just a
‘punch of lazy, do-nothing preppies.’’ Well, there are
still a couple of preppies on the E.C., but if the first
couple of weeks are to be any indication of what is to
come, the 1977-78 E.C. might prove itself to be a good
one.

Their action concerning two issues is evidence in
point. First, they have shown their responsibility to
the honor system and their concern for its effec-
tiveness by taking a summer survey. Second, they
have taken a gamble by taking some of the entertain-
ment power away from the S.A.B. and giving it to the
Music Union.

Not only does the summer survey show the E.C.
members’ concern for the honor system, but at pre-
sent the E.C. is working closely with the faculty in try-
ing to keep the independent exam system. If past
E.C.’s had gotten the kinks out of the system in its
early years, we wouldn’t have the problems we are
having now. Whether or not we keep the independent
exam system depends largely on how good a job the
E.C. members can do in expressing the student
body’s feelings to the faculty. It seems this year’s
members are more comfortable with the delegate
role than with the trustee role they took in the past.
This is the type of representation we want and need at
an important time such as this.

. By giving the Music Union the opportunity to book
entertainment acts into the Cockpit, the E.C. has
broken away from tradition. Now, people with
knowledge of good music and nose for the ‘“‘good”’ act
will be allowed to bring entertainment to campus. No
longer will the cursed S.A.B. with their famous bad
taste in music have the final and only word on what
acts will appear and when they will appear on cam-
pus.

The campus is already reaping the profits from the
good sense decision of the E.C. An excellent act ap-
peared in the Cockpit last weekend, another last
night, and three more are scheduled before the week
runs out. An alternative to fraternity partying and go-
ing down the road’’ has been given to the student
population. This is perhaps the best thing that has
happened to this campus in years—entertainment
alternatives that can be enjoyed during the week as
well as on the weekend. The new E.C. deserves thanks
for this special blessing.

Even with these reasons, some people can still find
fault with the ‘“‘government’’—the E.C. Not every
organization got what it desired during the budget
hearings. Some were cut unjustly, others justly.
Mistakes were unquestionably made, but the E.C. is
composed of humans, notorious for making mistakes.

So, even though some people will disregard points
in its favor and continue to be disenchanted with the

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry

 

Rag -- rag °** rag!

To the Editor:

Your editorial in last week’s
Phi was one of the few acts that
could possibly be more
outrageous than the activities
that led up to the arrests of two
fraternity presidents recently.

Living in the midst of a
number of fraternity houses I
can say from first hand ex-
perience that the noise level of
weekend partying has been
alarming. On several occasions
my wife and I have left our
apartment for some quiet and
have returned home at 1 a.m. to
the raucous sounds of high wat-
tage stereos, breaking windows
and bottles, primitive war
cries, banging garbage cans
and cars peeling out. Is the in-
tensity of our academic respon-
sibilities so great that it
justifies this type of behavior?

Your lord of the plantation at-
titude towards the towns people
is quite humorous. Having
worked in several restaurants
in town I feel free to say that the
W&L man is not the ideal
customer. I have seen
waitresses go untipped and be
abused by our gentlemen
regularly.

Your attitudes concerning
W&L jobs for townspeople,
tourist money, and traffic fines
are quite the punk ones.

You might consider that if the
fraternity members living in
this city do no wich to act in ac-
cordance with the behavior that
the city laws dictate there is a
plethora of secluded spots sur-
rounding the city where out-
siders will not be subjected to
the effects of the
undergraduates hormonal in-
balances.

Finally, I would suggest that
you would do better to improve
the editorial and mechanical
content of your rag then to show
off your threatening knowledge
of town gown riots’

Yours truly,
David Abrams ‘78

Dear Sir:

I would like to take this op-
portunity to comment on a cou-
ple of your recent articles. In
the first place I thought that
your editorial regarding ‘“‘rack
dates,’’ though sarcastic in
nature, displayed poor taste
and a sense of immaturity.
What disturbed me the most
was your pointed reference to
the girls from the surrounding
schools as ‘‘equestrian and
home-ec majors.’’ I have the
pleasure of attending RMWC
for two courses this term, so
surely you can classify me as
one of those so-called
equestrian majors. I’m sure
this will come as a big disap-
pointment to all of you, but I
have yet to encounter any of the
girls to whom you referred in
your editorial. The academic
quality of the school is every bit
as good as that of W&L’ If you
don’t believe me then why don’t
you accompany me to class
someday? Your remarks at-
tempt to show the superiority of
the W&L male, but in reality all
they display is sheer ignorance
and shoddy journalism.

Secondly, your article concer-
ning homecoming contained
several errors. Dr. Shillington
was not one of the judges as
reported in your article; his
duties pertained solely to the
crowning of the queen at the
football game. Dr. Hamer was
the judging whom you failed to
mention. Additionally, cocktails
did not precede the judge on
Friday afternoon. Rather, the
coctail party followed the judg-
“ng. Also, the judges did not
“examine”’ the girls at dinner,
since the judges were not even
present at dinner. Finally, the
judges did not ‘“‘interrogate’’
the girls; the atmosphere in
Fairfax Lounge did not in any
way resemble that of Devil’s
Island or Stalag 13’ Other than
the above corrections, your ar-
ticle was fairly accurate.

Sincerely,
Ed Wick, ‘78

Dear Editor:

During the past two weeks
there seems to be a ranging
firefight of opinions in this
editorial column. We have read
a carefree editorial on the
sophistaction of ‘“‘the W&L
gentlemen,’’ the up-
perclassman’s charisma, and
the socially uplifting ‘rack
date.’’ Then came a letter to the
editor steaming with hellfire
and brimstone which chastised
us for our ‘‘hypocritical
paradox’”’: we call ourselves
gentlemen yet we act like
animals. Both articles had a
particle of truth in them, yet
neither typifies the opinion of
the majority of W&L
gentlemen, which is difficult to
transcribe anyhow. All buts and
ifs aside, here is a poem which I
think apt:

The young monk walks the
streets,

Preaching true love needs no
body.

Look here upon Virgin Mary
so sweet,

For her body do not prostitute,
Says he,

She is beauty incarnated
within;

Soul so pure, mind so fine,

We have yet in 2000 years to
hear of her sin.”’

And there across the way a
man pines,

He looks upon the women walk-
ing to shops,

Desiring a body to love abed.
Never mind the soul,” thinks
he, licking his chops.

As he swears upon his phalic
head,

”’He’d never kick that gir] out of
bed.’’

Watching both self-saint and
animal,
Our gentleman
withal.

Perceiving love and what a
woman is,

Body and soul and yet more
must he and she give.

‘“‘Preppie,’’ This term, once
used to designate only those
who were alumni of classy
private boarding schools, is now
the victim of flagrant overuse
by University students. Clearly,
we are in need of some new,
more specific terms. To help

 

out everyone, especially the

confused first year students,
I’ve divided the category
‘“‘Preppie”’ into several clearly
recognizable sub-types. So as
you walk around the Grounds,
see if you can pick out any of the
following:

Good-Looking Prep: (GLP):
You can’t imagine them dress-
ed any other way. Tall, lean,
and classically good-looking,
they look as if kahkis and
button-downs were designed ex-
pressly with them in mind.
Usually southern and charming
(love that accent,) G.L.P. guys
have been known to make even
the most vehement anti-prep
girls (usually northern and
freaky) sign. G.L.P. girls are

easy to spot — they’re the only.

ones who don’t look ridiciulous
wearing kilts and knee socks.
Look for G.L.P.’s everywhere
— they’re few and far between,
but they make it all worthwhile.

Middle of the Road Prep: The
keynote here is moderation, the
M.R.P.’s ‘‘prep out,”’ but never
to extremes. The guys usually
stick to Levi cords and Lacoste
shirts (with an occasional
three-stripe belt) and prefer
Wallabees to Topsiders. The
girls wear denim wrap-around

. skirts and striped sweaters, but
never paired with opaque tights

Prepping Out in Every Way

and L. L. Bean duckhunters.
(Would you?)

Hard Core Prep: These are
the true preppies, the ones who
actually went to prep school.
Don’t blame them for the way
they dress — the truth is they
just don’t know any better. How
to spot them? On guys, round
toroise shell glasses are a dead
giveaway. (Another
distinguishing characteristic of
H.C.P.’s are the guys who wear
seersucker suits and ties to foot-
ball games, and the girls who
don’t wear any makeup. Males
of this species are given to good
dancing, raunchy gatoring, and
consorting with Hollins girls.
Their female counterparts
sport cloth-covered headbands,
canvas handbags, and
espadrilles in twelve decorator
colors. (Warning: Female
H.C.P.’s find it physically im-
possible to go into Eljos without
spending a fortune. )

There are two subcategories
of Hard Core Prep which

whould be mentioned (and
avoided! ):
Tacky Prep: If someone

published a ‘‘Ten Worst Dress-
ed List’ at the University,
tacky preps would take top
honors. It’s not exactly what
they wear that’s tacky, it’s how
they wear it and what they wear
it with. Their oxford shirts are
always wrinkled, and their
baggy 1950’s vintage gray flan-
nel suits look slightly less at-
tractive than a potato sack. T.

_ P. girls go in for skirts paired

with (ugh!) hiking boots. It just
doesn’t make it. The second
subcategory of Hard Core Prep,
however, makes tacky prep

seem almost tolerable.
I’m referring, of course, to —

Obnoxious Prep: These are the
kind of preppies who give other

 

preppies a bad name. O.P.’s are
probably most noted for their
bizarre color combinations, the
most notorious being lime green
and hot pink.

Psuedo Prep: These are the
Northern public school kids
who, when first arrived at the
University, were so green they
thought ‘‘Lacoste’’ was
somehwere on the French
Riviera. But they soon saw the
haniwriting on the wall (or
shoid I say the monograms on
the sweaters?) and lost no time
in acquiring a preppie war-
drobe. Over Christmas vacation
they got a couple of crewneck
sweaters, and at Spring Break
maybe a pair or two of Monet
earrings. By the start of their
second year, they were full-
fledged ‘‘prep stars,’’ complete-
ly outfitted with kahkis, oxford
shirts, and if they were really
serious, topsiders.

Psuedo Preps are the ones
you see slinking in and out of El-
jo’s (the local ‘‘one-stop-Wahoo-
shop’’), camouflaging their pur-
chases in a plain brown wrap-
per. This is because, deep in-
side, the psuedo prep is a tor-
tured soul, torn between his or
her longing to ‘‘prep out” (it’s a
sickness, remember) and the
fear of his (still freaky) friends’
sarcastic comments. (’’You
prep star! Where ya headed, St.
A’s?’’)

Of course, the possible com-
binations which could result
from the very basic preppie
types I’ve listed above are
endless; Tacky-pseudo, Good-
looking-hard core, etc. etc. And
it’s entirely possible that I’ve
overlooked some sub-type com-
pletely. If so, I apologize and in-
vite you to add to this list via a
letter to the editor.

Letters to Editor

Dear Editor:

It seems to me to be a very
appropriate time to set the
record straight as to which
Mike Brown wrote the letter to
the Editor in last week’s Ring-
tum Phi. After suffering much
verbal abuse since this
notorious letter’s publication, I
wish to make it emphatically
clear that Mike Brown, transfer
student, Class of 1979, was not
the author of said letter. I
seriously considered changing
my name, but a letter to the
Editor, seemed to be the most
logical recourse.

In addition, I wish to state
without reservation, that I do
not share the Victorian opinions
held, by my eminent namesake,
Mr. Brown, Class of 1980, and
his’ illustrious co-signers. I
transferred to W&L, not’ only
for its ddademic excellence, but

also for the abundance’ of' hose —

queens which flock to this cam-
pus from such Shangri-las as
Hollins, Sweet Briar, and that
hose heayen, Southern Sem. In
fact, I was fortunate enough to
have one of these princesses as
my guest Homecoming
weekend,..She was my “rack
date.” I was her ‘‘rack
gentleman.” After all, aren’t
girls mere toys or playthings?
Shouldn’t we discard them
when we are through, much as
we would a six-year old Pen-
thouse Magazine? Gee’ Mom

Dear Editor:

Gee wnillikers! You’d think
I'd placed a big wet smacker on
the cheek of the writer of that
article, the way he befuddled
who did what to whom in that
little old somewhat hackneyed
autumn tradition of crowning
the queen. Also, I didn’t get no
dinner either. Schillington may
have. Shillington didn’t.
Because for years now, I
haven’t judged the queens. I
crown ‘em. So, I guess I don’t
need my head examined. At
least not for now.

The good job was done by that
merry fine band of judges Mrs.
Miller and Ms. Chappel, Pro-
fessors Dobbs, Hamer, and
Stephenson. (it’s Hamer he left
out) Me? I takes what I gets
and it was as nice as ever,
thanks to the judges. And if the
Ring-tum Phi hasn’t any good
pictures of me, I’ll be glad to
turn the other cheek for you.

Organically yours,
James K. Shillington,

Student comment:

Bookworms of the

World, Unite!

by Paul VanCott

Bookworms of the world
unite! For all too many
semesters we've allowed
ourselves to be cajoled, ridicul-
ed, and otherwise made fun of.
The time has come for the world
to realize that we have been
grinding the last eighteen years
for a reason, not just because
we enjoy being recluses. As a
group, we have been categoriz-
ed as robots, existing solely out
of love for the written word. As
individuals, we have been
ostracized as teacher’s pets,
pussies, and wimps. No longer
will we tolerate insults concern-
ing our sexual potency, no
longer will we be studying on
the night of the prom. OUr time
hath come. While our contem-
poraries have been developing
their bodies, we have been
developing our minds. Those

bullies who used to make us eat
grass, will not eat without a job
from us. We, as a result of our
years of dedication, constitute
the “Executive Class.”’ Being a
bookworm has finally paid off.
Within our collective heads we
hold the knowledge that will
cure the common cold, end all
wars, and send space shuttles to
the moon. We make the world
and neutron bombs tick. Now
the fruits of long-range plann-
ing manifest themselves in a
social life that the blue-collar
studs of yesteryear will never
know. Thank you mothers for
making us study our hyperbolic
functions when we wanted to go
roller skating. I,m proud to be a

quartet, but again, C orey’s in-
terpretation was flawless. This
is a very singable piece with a
beautiful melody, a melody that
the guitarist brings out
marvelously (So much for the
idea that the guitar cannot
sing’). I particularly liked
this piece, but the concert was
such a complete success that it
is difficult to say that one work
is better than another.

As an overall judgment, the
guitar’s great advantage, it
seems to me, is its personal
quality. The ‘‘keys’’ strike the
strings on the piano not the
pianist, and the bow most of the
time accomplishes this on the
violin, but the guitarist is the
one who personally generates
the sound. It is a closeness that
is seemingly so responsible for

the appeal a good guitarist has
to the audience. Mr. Corey,
throughout his’ concert
| displayed this personal feeling
| for the guitar and this, coupled
| with his great technical ability,
| could only result in a great con-
cert. It did. No wonder Mr. Cor-
ey was the youngest performer
| ever to win the Concert Artists
| Guild Award. Judging from his
| performance Tuesday night, he
deserved it.

EC postpones

salary discussions

By a margin of eleven to
nothing, the Executive Commit-
tee voted last Monday night to
hold open hearings on the sub-
ject of publication board
salaries. Present student jour-
nalists receiving salaries are
Peter Goss, the business
manager of the Ring-tum Phi;
J. Michael Gallagher, editor-in-
chief of the Ring-tum Phi;
Temp Webber, head editor of
the Calyx; and possibly Grant
Leister, treasurer of the year-
book.

The salaries to the top jour-
nalists have aroused controver-
sy throughout the campus since
their inception. Last year, the
Executive Committee, under
the leadership of Law School
representative Rick Goddard,
changed its role from passive
Surveyor to a popular wat-
chdog. Goddard continues his
unceasing scrutiny of the
salaried students. Lashing out
against the idea of students
reaping profits from the rest of
the school, Goddard convinced
his colleagues to cut the RtP
budget from $3,000 to $2,500.

The newspaper, however, after
pointing out the fact that it had
cut the budget request from
$4,000 in 1976 to $3,000 a year
later, regained $4,000 of the
withheld funds. Another factor
in getting the funds back was
the apparent and imminent con-
traction of the newspaper to
eight pages if the Executive
Committee did not relent on its
cutbacks.

The open hearing scheduled
for Monday, October 24, will ac-
cumulate the views of concern-
ed students around the campus
on the ‘salary’ subject and will
gather these testimonies to
assist, in theory, the members
of the Executive Committee in
its decision. An anonymous
committeeman stated that
while the hearings may help
other members formulate their
final judgements, he has
definitely decided to oppose
salaries in any way, shape or
form. This member, however,
felt that granting credits to the
participants could very well be
a viable compromise.

the United States’ press system
he said. As these chains con-
tinue to grow, so will the con-
formity of ideas, he added.

Merrill asked the audience to
consider what has happened to
the press systems of some
Eastern European nations as an
example of what may happen to
American journalism. Merrill
blamed the growth of press
councils for the decrease of
pluralism of ideas.

‘In nations that once had ag-
gressive press systems such as
Great Britain and Sweden,
press councils have done much
to weaken them. Sweden used to
have an aggressive free press
until Swedish press councils
were introduced. Some people
still consider Sweden a great
place to live but the truth is: if
you want to live like a termite,
move to Sweden.”’

‘““Journalsim, unlike law and
medicine, was never meant to

| be a profession,” Merrill ex-
| plained. ‘Journalists should not
_ be requi‘ red to have a license
_ or a degree. Journalism is not a
profession, it is more of a craft
or a trade. Political Scientists,
‘sociologists and even people
'who don’t have college degrees
Should be allowed to become

journalists. Different
backgrounds are essential, as is
‘non-conformity.”’

' Sigma Delta Chi, the national-
ly known society of professional
journalists, has also been guilty
of decreasing idea diversity, ac-
cording to Merrill. Merrill pinn-
ed much of the blame on Casey
‘Buckgrove of the ‘Chicago
‘Tribune”’ for writing a list of
‘poorly written’ suggestions
for journalists to follow.

 “Buckgrove used to be the en-
vironmental editor for the
‘Tribune,’ Merrill stated. ‘“‘I
faced him once in a debate and I

 

practically killed him. Instead
of writing up suggestions for
journalists to follow, he still
should be writing about trash
and pollution—actually he still

The concept of a forced social
responsibility theory is, ac-
cording to Merrill, strikingly
similar to how previously free
nations have fallen under
totalitarian government. Mer-

clothes for one machine is nine
pounds. Putting more than this
amount into the machine can
damage it, Darrell said. After a
lot of people overload the
machines the motor belts start
stretching and this causes a loss
in drying power. According to
Darrell, this means that a
regular nine pound load would
take one or two extra cycles to
be completely dry. Hence in the
long run, putting more than
nine pounds of clothes into a
dryer to get your money’s worth
doesn’t pay off.

Darrell believes that a steer-
ing committee headed by the
newly elected freshman class
president could look into the
ways in which the service could
be improved. Among the ideas
he has is putting a scale into the
laundry room so students can
weigh their clothes so as not to
overload a machine. He also
suggests a new system of
security for the room. Darrell
cited an incident where a couple
of years ago a townie used one
of the washers to clean a dirty
rug for fear of ruining his
washing machine. He is confi-
dent that a new system of
security could be established by
this committee.

Darrell cited a lack of com-
munication between _ the
students and the system

cering the washers and dryers.
He said that only during this
summer did he come to be in
charge of the service and stated
that he really didn’t have time
to look into the service until
recently.

Darrell also said that should
the new system work; two or
three more washers and dryers
could be added in the near
future’ He stated that it would
be betier to “first solve the ex-
isting problems and then ap-

For all you lovers of Melville,
Emerson, and Thoreau there is
a new addition to your ranks at
Washington and Lee in the
perssonage of Dr. Robert P.
Fure. As a fledging member of
W&L’s English department,
Dr. Fure is teaching courses in
expository writing, introduc-
tory drama and poetry, as well
as in his specialty, American
Literature.

Born and raised
midwest, Dr.

in the
Fure attended
high school in suburban
Chicago. From there, he
journeyed nr-orthward to Nor-

thern Michigan University,
from whence he graduated in
1968. He did his subsequent
graduate work at Berkeley
University, where he earned a
Doctorate in English. For the
past four years Dr. Fure has
been teaching introductory
English courses at his graduate
school alma mater.

Luck, according to Dr. Fure,
brought him to Washington and
Lee. Although he applied to both
Cornell University and Col-
orado State for teaching posi-
tions, Dr. Fure was very pleas-
ed to accept a three year ap-
pointment to the W&L English
department. Dr. Fure cites the

excellent facilities, the equally
excellent faculty and the
politeness, dilligence, and
general positive outlook of the
students as decisive factors in
his decision to come to
Washington and Lee.

Dr. Fure finds the English
department both congenial and
diverse, providing him not only
with the encouragement to con-
tinue in his profession, but also
with the opportunity to further
his natural process of growth.
He views his role at Washington
and Lee as that of a student as
well as that of a teacher, and
consequently appreciates the
worth of a good English depart-
ment.

When asked to state his opi-
nions on the Honor System and
co-education at W&L, Dr.
Robert P. Fure did not hesitate
in being very candid. “The
Honor System,” according to
Dr. Fure, “‘is an intriguing ex-
periment” which he is ‘‘willing
to support” because he feels ‘‘a
great need for rededication to
the principles of honor.’’ More
specifically, in response to a
question concerning the in-
dividual scheduling of exams,
Dr. Fure maintained that an
honor system such as ours rests
upon a trust of the student in an
exam situation. As far as co-
education was concerned, Dr.
Fure recognized its disad-
vantages but had yet to see its
advantages. He elected to wait
until he had a more definte opi-
nion before he decided whether
an all-male enrollment was an
attribute or detriment to
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty.

While at W&L Dr. Fure in-
tends to author a book on the
famous American poet, William
Jenning Williams. He also
hopes to learn as much as possi-
ble about the southeast and its
people as possible, the city of
Lexington and Rockbridge
County notwithstanding. Most
importantly though, Dr. Fure
wants to teach a variety of sub-
jects, and through teaching con-
stantly learn and grow. He con-
cluded that “‘if there is any
disadvantage to the present ex-
perience...it’s that I don’t have
enough time to accomplish all
that I want to accomplish.”

The Ring-tum Phi takes this
opportunity to welcome Dr.
Robert P. Fure to Washington
and Lee, and to wish him good
luck here, and in all other future
enterprises.

EC retains wages

For publications heads

by David Abrams

The Executive Committee of
Washington and Lee University
voted ‘down a motion to discon-
tinue monetary compensation
for the editors and business
managers of the Ring-tum Phi
andCalyx at Monday night’s
meeting.

Also, a motion to suggest to
faculty members that they
specify exactly how they want
their exams taken, under
Washington and Lee’s indepen-
dent exam system, and
clarification for students of the
independent exam system dur-
ing orientation was passed.

Mike Missal, senior EC
representative, who introduced
the motion to discontinue
salaries, said the constitution of
the Publishing Board authoriz-
ed salaries but this could be
changed by a two-thirds vote of
the EC over two consecutive
meetings.

Ryland Owens, president of
the Publishing Board, said that
students holding these paid
positions receive 22! per cent
of the publications’ yearly pro-
fits and that the Calyx and
Ring-tum Phi were the only
campus organizations that were
largely self-supportive. He said
that taking away the compensa-
tion for these jobs would en-

Independent exams,

Faculty favors retention

said they would not vote for the
retention of independent ex-
ams, expressed several
dissatisfactions with the pre-
sent system. Chief among their
considerations was the feeling
of faculty members that the
studen.t EC was not acting in
accordance with the initial pro-
mises it made when indepen-
dent exams were initiated. Ac-
cording to several department
heads, the EC has become pro-
gressively more languid in its
duty to assure that no aspects of
exams are discussed by
students. Another complaint

voiced by professors was that .

too often students call them to
make changes in their exam
schedules. Overall, teachers
who are skeptical of the present
system say it places too much
strain on the honor code.

Here are replices from in-
dividual department heads:

Accounting

Professor Cook said that, at
this point, he was not sure how
he would vote on the issue.
However, he did recommend
last spring that the present
system be done away with
because of its strain on the
honor code. Cook saw the main
problem with the present
system as resting with the EC.
He said you have to have a
strong EC, which should be
alert to problems and willing to
act quicly to correct those pro-
blems. Professor Cook did ad-
mit, however, that the faculty
will probably vote to retain in-
dependent exams.

Administration
Professor DeVogt said he
believed the present system
should not be abolished.
However, he did believe the EC
should keep harping on the idea
that no aspects of exams are to

be discussed. DeVogt believes
there are no more violations
under the present system than
under the previous system.

Biology
Professor Starling said he
likes the way things are set up
now, and he did not know of
anyone in his department that
was against the present system.

Chemistry

Professor Wise voiced opi-
nions similar to Professor Starl-
ing, stating he would vote in
favor of retaining independent
exams, and that he did not know
anyone in his department that
was against them.

Classics
Professor Taylor reported
that he was in favor of the pre-
sent system, adding that it
works quite well and that he did
not see necessity for im-
provements.

Economics
Professor Griffith said that he
would vote against the retention
of independent exams if it came
to a faculty vote. He added he
couldn’t speak for the whole
department.

English

Professor Duvall expressed
the opinion that he was neither
strongly in favor of the present
system, nor against it. He
stated he did not like the idea of
independent exams before they
were initiated but now he is us-
ed to it. He added independent
exams are not really more con-
venient for professors.

Fine Arts
Professor Gordon com-
mented that he does not have

SPE hit with fine

by Lee Howard

Sigma Phi Epsilon president
Mark Danos was fined $10 plus
$13 in court costs Tuesday for
violation of Lexington’s noise
ordinance during Homecoming
weekend.

The past week Phi Gamma
Delta’s president Charlie
Brown was fined a similar
amount for excessive noise
emanating from his fraternity’s
house. Both plead guilty to the
charges.

The noise ordinance, which
carries a maximum penalty of
$1,000 and/or a year in jail, has
been in effect ‘‘for some time,”’
said Danos, but the police have
only started enforcing it this
year. He said he believes city
manager John V. Doane may be

behind the new enforcement
policy. Doane lives almost
directly behind the SPE house
and has been by the house
several times to complain of
loud noise, Danos said.

Danos called the stand-off
between fraternities and towns’
people a ‘‘practical problem.”’
It is hard to have a party and
abide by the ordinance at the
same time, Danos said, Lex-
ington General District Court
Judge Joseph E. Hess was
‘understanding’? when said
Hess it was virtually impossible
to close a party at 11 p.m.,

far as to jokingly suggest that

A Separate Peace;

law library vote

by Jim Ingham

Undergraduate use of the law
library may be restricted in the
near future. Tomorrow law
students vote on either of two
proposals dealing with use of
the law library by non-law
students. An open forum for the
law students will be held tonight
to debate which proposal will be
accepted if either.

In the past, according to Ray-
mond Leven, president of the
Student Bar Association, there
had been no policy concerning
undergraduate use of the law
library. In the _ past,
undergraduates could use the
library if they acted in a respec-
table manner. Lately, however,
some law students have com-
plained about undergrads in the
library, Leven said. He would
not elaborate beyond this.

The two proposals differ in

the amount of restriction placed
upon use of the library. Pro-
posal A makes use of the library
much more restricted. Ac-
cording to this plan, visitors
could only use the library if
their tasks were “related solely
to legal research.”’ At no time
would undergrads be able to use
the SAB Television lounge,
seminar rooms, the upper level,
or any carrel space. To use the
library for legal research a stu-
dent would have to register at
the desk. If an undergrad did
not register and was a general
disturbance, according to the
proposal, he would have to
leave. If he refused, proper
disciplinary action would be
taken by the Student Control
Committee.

Proposal B is a less restric-
tive one as far as the use of the
library goes. Law students and
those engaged in legal research

hoped the opportunity for law
school students and
undergraduates to meet face to
face would alleviate any
animosity the groups might
have for each other.

Although perhaps not totally
successful in this aim (Bill
Tucker, SAB co-chairman said
he didn’t think the two groups
mixed it up very much), the
SAB might at least have ad-
justed some law school at-
titudes toward the SAB. Charlie
Hulfish, also SAB co-chairman,
said many first year law
students think the activities put
on by his organization are only
for undergraduates. He said he
thought the Lewis Hall party
was a good way to publicize the
fact that the SAB works for all
Washington and Lee students.

One SAB member, however,
candidly admitted the SAB was
trying to make a point; the SAB
‘does provide entertainment for
the law school too. Law school
representatives submitted the
opinion during budget hearings
that very few SAB functions are
geared toward law students to
bolster their contention that the
law school should get back 95
per cent of its student activity

Parents will replenish the fort with supplies this weekend.

 

by Jim Parker

According to an informal poll
of the faculty, the general reac-
tion of W&L professors towards
the Executive Committee sum-
mer survey on the honor system
is favorable. Also, the majority
of the faculty members ques-
tioned are in favor of retaining
the independent exam schedule.

The survey consisted of ques-
tions asked to at least one
member in most of the major
departments. Fifteen faculty
members in all were surveyed.
The professors were picked at
random, except for a few
specific faculty members who
have previously expressed opi-
nions concerning independent
exams. An example is Dr. Cook,
an economics professor, who
last year proposed the abolition
of the independent exam
system. Cook’s responses and
those of other faculty members
on certain questions were
revealing.

There was little worth reveal-
ing concerning the general
response of the teachers to the
EC summer survey. All pro-
fessors questioned believed it
worthwhile to take such a
survey, although most of the
professors had only a vague
idea of the survey. One pro-
fessor raised the question of
cost. He felt it was worthwhile if
the survey didn’t cost thousands
of dollars.

Although there were few ob-
jections to having the survey,
there were some concerning the
questions asked and _ the
responses. Several professors
found the questions too general
although a few praised this
quality. One faculty member
thought a question asking what
method students believe could
be used to undercut the indepen-
dent exam system would have
been appropriate. Another
teacher was concerned not with
the response of the 40 odd per
cent who answered the survey,
but the majority who did not.
Responses to the EC poll
varied, but those concerning re-
taining the independent exam
system were more uniform.

Only two faculty members
questioned were opposed to the
independent exam system. The
reasons given for opposing in-
dependent exams were that
they put too much strain on the
students and on the honor
system. Even Dr. Cook said he
supports the system if it can be
strictly enforced by the student
EC. However, he believes this

Faculty praise summer survey

to be impossible year after
year. For the most part, the
faculty’s opinions were not
swayed by the EC survey. One
member was negatively af-
fected by the survey, although
not greatly. Another was less
supportive of the independent
exam schedule before the
survey than after. He said if the
system gives the student a bet-
ter education, it should be re-
tained.

There was some disagree-
ment on whether the present ad-
ministering of the independent
exam system was the proper
method. One professor believed
that there should not be excep-
tions to the rules. For example,
allowing a student to move
around his time for taking a
final exam after it is already
scheduled should not be allow-
ed, he said. The professor sup-
ported either total control or

*non-control, but no middle
ground. Another professor
believed independent exams
couldn’t work unless the EC
toughens up. However, most of

Professor Spencer said he
thought the present indepen-

members of his department
would rather see scheduled ex-

the students’ backs.

Professor Stephenson said he

I had a blind date last
weekend. Well, she wasn’t real-
} ly blind. She could see two feet
} in front of her. At least she had
two feet. I can only imagine how
many feet she thought I had. I
was never allowed to come
within the required distance.
Not that I wanted to. I think she
used a full can of ‘‘Off’’ for a
perfume.

Anyway, there I was with old
four eyes (or by that time it
may have been eight eyes) sipp-
ing beers in the Cockpit when
}she said “‘Gee!”’ Not that her
ejaculation added anything to
my soliloquy, but at least we
}had made some progress
toward social intercourse. I also
found out that she was not as
thick as the lenses of her
glasses.

Well, to make a short story
long, not much else happened.
We could have danced all night,
but she had two sprained left
ankles. We would have laughed
all night, but she didn’t ap-

preciate dead baby jokes. We
should have loved all night, but
when she went to the ladies
room to powder her five o’clock
shadow I was completely gross-
ed out.

So remember that old adage}
Altrurians: ,When life thrusts
you a rotten apple eschew it,
don’t chew it. That’s exactly
what I did. Leaving enough
money on the table to pay for
her cab fare to within 30 miles
of her school, I left. She said
nothing. Maybe she didn’t even
know I was there. Maybe she
was deaf as well as blind.
Maybe she thought I was a gnat.
Maybe I am a gnat. Maybe I am
paranoid. Maybe I should end
here. Maybe not.

They say all great writers
have tentative endings. Maybe I

have delusions of grandeur.
They say love is a “perhaps
hand.” What is hatred, a

“perhaps club?” These and
other great mysteries will be
discussed next week. Perhaps.

Poor, Wretched Oedipus

A RING-TUM PHI COMMENTARY

by John Jacobsen

The current production of
Sophocles’ Oedipus the King at
the Boiler Room Theatre proves
that the word ‘tragedy’ does
not necessarily have to be used
to describe the downfall of a
great man, but it may also be
used to describe the downfall of
a great play.Oedipus is a play of
fate and its tragic effect
depends on the conflict between
the will of the gods and the vain
efforts of human beings
threatened with disaster.
“Resignation to the divine will,
and the perception of one’s own
impotence is the lesson which
the deeply moved spectator is
supposed to learn from the
tragedy.”’ However, if Oedipus
is going to move a modern au-
dience the strength of the pro-
duction must not lie with the
plot as much as it lies with the
peculiar nature in which it is
revealed. As Freud said,
“There must be a voice in us
which is prepared to
acknowledge the compelling
power of fate...’’ and this voice
must be nutured in a production
of Oedipus: we must feel for the
king for his fate might have
been our own!

We rarely feel for the king,
here, however. Warren Mowry,
playing the part of Oedipus,
shares with us only the
shallowest of emotions. We
must feel the contrast between
the Oedipus in the opening

scenes — a man of wealth,
power, and knowledge, ‘‘first of
men” — and the Oedipus

towards the end — an obscure
figure, an incestuous patricide,
“most accursed of men.”’ He
must be strong in the start, in
gestures and movement. His
voice must tell us that he is
helmsman. With Mowry this
comes across only occasionally.
We de not feel the power in his
voice — the power that he
believes what he is saying —
and we do not see in his eyes the
concern for his people. We do
not see it because, perhaps, it is
not there within the actor.

This is another problem with
the production: we see very lit-
tle acting. The Chorus’ lines, for
example, carry little emotion or

the scenes of the crime were
charming in lonely houses
blanketed in the worst blizzard
of the century. The list of
suspects was invariably a rare
old collection of eccentrics all of
whom had excellent reasons for
sending the victim to his unhap-
py reward.

However, when home-grown
products began to appear on the
drug market there was a shift in
the mix of our fix.'‘Why was the
drime committed became more
important than who had done it.
We followed both hunted and

force. There is a great deal of
yelling and the hitting of knees,
but very little hoping and the
punching of lines. We need to
feel the confidence of the
Chorus in Oedipus, the king, in
the beginning before Tiresias’
entrance. A smile. A laugh. A
cheer! Even a little applause
might have shown that there
was at least a minute bit of life
left in Thebes.

Jocasta’s entrance; ironical-
ly enough, does indeed ‘‘come in
the nick of time.” Watching
Ellen Jervey; in the role move
about the stage and smile and
cry and speak with some inten-
sity is a needed relief from the
cool and not-so collected Creon.
He is a politician, a calculator:
this part Jim Weatherstone
plays well. However, he seems
to have trouble in leaving this
mold and when it comes time to
beg for a hearing from Oedipus,
all we see is a calculated clen-
ching of the fists in the air.

David Chester, however, in
the role of Tiresias, holds very
well. He has a character that is

from the Bookstore

hunter. The sleuth was no
longer the classy, broadly
educated expert but drab,
cynical and complicated.
Dashiell Hammett and Ray-
mond Chandler established the
prototypes. Sex reared its ugly
head, It was a seamy world of
little, sad people—no second
sons of dukes here—where
nobody won. Yet no matter how
violent and degraded they were,
Mickey Spillane and James
Bond seemed to hang on to
some small kernel of integrity
— a point of loyality beyond
which even they .would not go.

And'we addicts‘ persisted. uSing’

identifiable for the most part
and that is usually motivated.

The direction, then, by Lee
Kahn, contains many in-
consistencies. Why do we see at
least attempts in fine directing
with the main characters and
very little; if any, with the
members of the Chorus? Why
does the Chorus drop into a
Gregorian Chant thus casting
Christian overtones to a Greek
play? Why props with the
Chorus and none with the
others? Why does Oedipus not
limp from the chains about his
ankles? Why the constant and
inane beating of pipes?

The set, designed by Tom
Zeigler and Hunt Brown, is
clear, crisp, and defined.
Oedipus the King could work
well here in the arena, for the
actors are close at hand and
therefore should be easy to feel.
Yet we miss almost all the emo-
tional and persona! act of the
play, and that in itself is a
tragedy. :

Today it seems as if the best
stuff is again being imported

Swedish writers are among
most valued connections, along

In Your Pit—-—

Cockpit Crowds Grow

by Galen Trussell

This is the initial, and
possibly only installment of ‘In
Your Pit’’, so it seems only fit-
ting that you, dear reader,
should realize what I, dear
writer, am attempting to do
with this column. It is not mere-
ly for me to exercise my jour-
nalistic prowess, but more to
report to you the happenings in
the Cockpit and plans for future
events, thereabouts. Here goes:

George Fagan played last
Thursday ngiht to a fair crowd.
Everyone I talked to said he
sounded good, but George
doesn’t agree. He said he needs
more time to work on his
material.

Friday started out featuring
Dominic and John, but evolved
into a loose jam, ending up
featuring Ed Blomquist on
bass, and Pete Davis on guitar.
Their renditions of the Dead
were tight and the crowd didn’t
want to leave at closing time.

THE

Well, without causing too
much of a stir I am going to at-
tempt to do something in this
article that I hope y’all don’t get
too upset about. Remember
everything is fun.

Remember last week when
the article ‘Prepping Out In
Every Way’ appeared in the
Phi, well I thought that it would
be fun to attach a few names to
some of the categories. Well,

Especially after a wealthy
alumnus, Bill Saunders (Class
of ‘41), bought everyone in the
place a round of beer to the tune
of almost $70.

Saturday even featured a
visiting guest artist from VMI
named Jeff Smith. Jeff played
mostly his own stuff. Again the
crowd approved.

Attendance in the Cockpit
was very good over the
weekend. Dan Scott estimated
that the Pit packed in 300 to 400
each night. Specials on dark
beer never hurt.

In The Works

The University Center Com-

of the Student Music Union

Dave Von Ronk in the Cockpit
this term for at least one night.
Von Ronk does not make many

KNOWS

Donny the rear or flunky list is
brought up by Bobby, Jimmy,
Willie (sounds like the line up
for the Mouseketeers) and Air
and Head. Of course Lee of AD
is about the king of the campus.
The Phi Delt’s use to have a few
of these, but most of them are
gone except for Skoot, Syd, Hal,
Trace and Tift. Certainly not a
bad selection. If only they
wanted to make some money I
could certainly set up an in-
teresting service between the
lonely girls over hear and y’all.

This specific type doesn’t
need to shop at Eljo’s they can
be found in the major cities
where Brooks Brothers have
their branch stores. Incidently
they wouldn’t be caught dead in
Leroy Worley’s Adair Hutton.

Middle of the Road Prep
seems to be made for the
Pika’s. Pika’s don’t fool around.
They know they’re studs (that is
except for PW, he still has not
figured out why he lost the EC
election.) Nash, Sip, Dew, Cliff
and Wally head the list here
almost rivaling their nighbors.
At the other end is HK. Well, we
could write a whole story on
him. Some other frats try and
get in this category but few suc-
ceed. The X’s, Beta’s, Pi Kapp’s
and Delt’s are just a few.

Hard Core Preps: well only a
few, but they must be mention-
ed. At the Phi Kapp house we
have AB who heads the list and
the rest of the house to follow,
Botts is co-chairman with AB.
The X’s hit this one real hard
with half their fhouse falling in-
to this cat. MP, BC, KL, CT,
MM, RS, and of course
veryones favorite Jack the Rip-
per. Tacky Prep hits the Beta’s
at full force. Plater leads the
list (sandals with socks, really
now). Honestly, I don’t think
those boys ever saw an iron in
their life. And who says your
pants have to come to the mid-
dle of your calf and stop.

Obnoxious Prep: you
remember these are the ones
with lime green and hot
pink...One in every house, X’s

Soccer Team To Play
In VISA Tournament

by Chris Fay

The W&L soccer team has
made it to the Virginia playoffs,
for the first time since 1968. On
Monday, Nov. 7, the team will
host University of Virginia.

Head soccer coach Rolp Pira-
nian is understandably pleased
with making the playoffs and so
are the players. Piranian refer-
red to the honor as one more
feather in the W&L soccer cap.
Other accomplishments of the
team this year have been winn-
ing the Virginia Wesleyan Tour-
nament and being the ODAC
Champs.

The team will have busy days
ahead. They have 7 games in 18
days. Including a _ regular
season game against UVa on
Friday. Woever wins the first
game between the two teams
will have a big mental ad-
vantage in the playoff game.

As of yet Piranian has nothing
special cooked up for UVa. He
continues to take the games a
day at a time.

Last Saturday the Generals
played VMI. The players from
VMI marred an_ otherwise
beautiful day by beating the
Generals and, as they say in the
military trade, by decomission-
ing Mark Turner.

In the opening minutes of the
game VMI scored the only goal.
Homer Bliss, the W&L sweeper
fullback, was by the edge of the
18 yard box ready to trap an in-
coming, bouncing ball. Mark

Bolstered by the best defen-
sive effort of the season and an
uncorked offense which rolled
up 270 yards on the ground, the
Generals rumbled to their first
win in seven games, conquering
“the Mountain” and the Univer-
sity of the South 21-14.

Stu Atkinson’s one yard

- plunge with 41 seconds left in

the game capped a 66 yard, 9
play drive, providing the
margin of victory and had a
dampening effect on the spirits
of Sewanee’s homecoming
crowd.

Enjoying one of the best after-
noons of his career, Atkinson
provided much of the spark,
carrying the ball 16 yimes for

Tennis Team Takes Fourth
In First W&L Tournament

by Jim Barnes

Washington and Lee conclud-
ed its fall tennis program last
weekend as well as its first in-
vitational tournament on a less
than optimistic note last
weekend. With the Universities
of Virginia, Maryland, and Ohio
in attendance, the competion
was too tough for the Generals
to finish any higher than fourth
out of four. That’s not to say
that the team was completely
outclassed by the visitors. The
netters had their chances, par-
ticularly against Ohio and
Maryland, but their inex-
periance became apparent in
the close matches.

On Friday the team faced
Virginia in the opening match
as Maryland played Ohio at the
VMI tennis courts. The
Generals managed a meager
improvement in the team score
over last year’s confrontation
with the Cavaliers, as Captain
Ben Johns and sophmore
Stewart Jackson took Hank
Harris and Jim Hilmer at the
number one doubles’ spot, 6-1,
6-4. Last year the team was
blitzed by UVA 9-0. Johns and
Jackson provided the only win
of the day as the team lost 8-1.
At the number one. singles

Johns played a great match ina
losing effort 3-6, 7-5, 5-7, to
Virginia’s Hank Harris.

W&L’s second match with
Ohio was the closest. Of all the
matches the Generals played,
this one had the most promise of
vi ctory. Johns defeated Jim
Asher, 6-2, 6-1. Jackson lost a
elose match to Tony Torlina,
7-6(5-0), 6-4, at the number two
spot. Freshman Cody Davis
gave the Generals their only
other win in singles, defeating
the number three player from
Ohio, David Mossoiah, 7-5, 6-2.
Sophmore David Constine and
freshmen Robert Schuler and
Doug Gaker all lost their
respeetive four, five, and six
singles matches. In doubles
Division III’s best, Johns and
Jackson, defeated Mossoiah
and Opperlander, at the
number one doubles position,
6-4, 6-0. Sophmore Pat Norris
teamed with Davis. Davis and
Norris dropped the first set 1-6.
They struggled back to win the
second set 6-4, but saw their
comeback halted by Asher and
Torlina, 6-4 in the third set. Con-
stine and Schuler’s match
followed a similar patter, only
the scores were 7-5, 5-7, 6-3,
Ohio.

It is at doubles that the
Generals sorely miss
Makepeace and Keesler, last
year’s four and five lettermen,
who will be abroad this Spring
term in Europe. Last year W&L
fielded three strong doubles
teams with Constine sitting out
in lieu of Norris at the number
two doubles spot with last
year’s Captain, senior Ken
Voelker. At this point it does
not seem that these players will
be as successful as their team-
mates were.

Later in the afternoon the net-
ters faced their final opponent
of the tournament, the Ter-
rapins of Maryland, Once again
Davis captured a victory at his
number three spot, crushing
John Olson, 6-2, 6. Gaker
defeated the Terp’s Ron
Schaub, 6-3, 6-3, for the only
other W&L singles’ win. Davis
and Norris defeated Olson and
Joe Garber at the number two
doubles spot 7-6(5-0), 6-2. The
Terps won the rest and the
match 6-3. The final standings
in the tournament were:
Virginia, Maryland, Ohio, and
W&L.

Personel-wise Cody Davis
was the brightest spot on the

(continued on, page 7)

118 yards. Freshman Karl
Cheatham added 87 yards on 18
carries to give the Generals
their best balanced backfield

attack of the year.

The third ace of the W&L
backfield, Scott McLam opened
the scoring by taking a Ted
Hissey pass, and dodging his
way 38 yards for a score capp-
ing a 72 yard drive. Cheatham
crashed in from 8 yards out with
49 second left in the first
quarter to top off a 77 yard drive
that provided the Generals with

a 14-0lead.

Sewanee stormed back
amassing mostof its 261 total
first half yards in the second
quarter as quarterback Tom
Clark hit receivers Joe Shults

and Malloy Nimochs on scoring’
strikes of 18 and 38 yards
respectively tying the game at
14 all going into the intermis-

sion.

But the Generals would not be
intimated by the mountain nor
its men as they emerged confi-
dent and ready to play their

best defense of the year.

Spearheaded by sophomore

tackle Jamie Ryan (9 tackles, 1

assist), W&L allowed only 46
yards total offense in the second

half as the Tigers showed a

streak of pink in their purple

jerseys. This is not to say the

defense played poorly in the
first half—quite the contrary. In
fact, the Big “‘D: preserved the
Generals’ 14-0 first quarter
lead, making Sewanee turn the
ball over on downs on three oc-
casions while inside the W&L

thirty yard line.
The front four of Greg Lilly,

Ken Smith, Ryan and Joe

completing only 17 passes,
three of which went to W&L
defenders Crossley, McGowan
and Norberg. The last intercep-
tion ended all Sewanee hopes of
a comeback as it came with on-
ly 21 seconds left.

W&L had a chance to salt the
game away in the third quarter
with a first and goal on the
Sewanee four yard line, but
were unable to punch it in. A
spectacular punt return of 82
yards by Norberg was nullified
with two and a half minutes re-
maining in the third quarter on
a questionable holding penalty.

Syd Farrar denied the Tigers
good field position much of the
day as he averaged almost 42
yards a punt.

Finally, with five minutes re-
maining in the game, the
Generals mounted the final
drive of the game culminating
in Atkinson’s score. Freshman
Dave Edward’s first PAT of his
collegiate career capped the
scoring for the day, final W&L
21—Sewanee 14.

The Generals’ first victory of
the year is even more im-
pressive when considering the
locality of the game. The clear
skies and warm temperatures
of Sewanee, Tennessee, _in-
evitably betrays the true
atmosphere—that of hell. As
Coach Williams is fond of say-
ing, ‘‘“God was mistaken when
he said hell was down.”’

Climbing the famous ‘‘Moun-
tain” seems pleasant until the
stare of Johnny Majors dad,
Shirley one that could stop a
herd of stampeding rhinos,
meet the trepassing visitors.
The referees are about as un-
biased as Lester Maddox (13
penalties vs. W&L) and seem to
revel in trying to verbally in-
timidate the opposition.

Thus this all provides the ic-
ing on the cake as the Generals
not only had to play well to
win—they had to play excep-

Football

by Galen Trussell

Following Tuesday’s semi-
final game only Law 2 and the
Phi Kapps were in contention
for the I. M. Football crown.

The Phi Kapps won a convinc-
ing victory over SAE by a score
of 31-6 Tuesday. The game was
originally scheduled for Mon-
day, but was postponed.

Law 2 met victory in a hard
fought game against Law 3 on
Monday. The: score was 12-7,
with Law 2 scoring on
touchdown passes by John Mur-
phy to Brick Brown and Rick
Muser.

In the quarter-final round,
Law 2 beat Delta Tau Delta in
overtime. The Law 2 team ac-
cummulated more yardage in
one set of downs than the Delts,
thus gaining a semi-final spot.

Law 3 beat the Fiji’s in their

Bussard’s Cuts, a group of in-

afternoon.

Both teams entered Tues-
day’s contest with identical 7-0
records. The law school was
coming off a win over a strong
Sigma Chi team, including
former varsity letterman A. O.
Smith. Smith was the only per-
son to win for Sigma Chi,
however, as his team went

Bussard’s Cuts got to the

Bennett, the W&L goalie, called

The Keydet finished the play by

It was up to the doubles com-

finals by beating their op-

On Tuesday Howard, news

sighed.

starting center forward.

W&L dropped another home
game to Hampden-Sydney by a
1-0 score. Hot goaltending was
also the Generals’ downfall in
this as they handily out shot
both H-Sc as they did VMI, only
to come up scoreless. The H-SC
defeat completed the Generals’
season at 2-2.

The Generals out played VMI
but couldn’t score. Their shots
were often wide of the net. The
VMI goalie mjst be given credit
for doing a fine job in stopping
the shots that were on goal.
Jamie Small from Virginia
Beach summed up the game,
“W&L definitely out played
VMI. They just had a few
breaks.”

As coach Rolf Piranian put it,
‘‘We didn’t lose, we just ran out
of time.’’ Roanoke defeated
Hampden-Sydney 3-1 last Satur-
day putting the Generals into
the VISA state playoffs as
champions of the VISA Western
Division II. Sometime between
November 5th and 12th, W&L
will host Virginia, the champ of
Western Division I, and
Christopher Newport (Eastern
Div. II) will host William &
Mary (Eastern Div. I). The two
winners will meet to determine
the 1977 state champion. Lyn-

will not defend it’s crown due to
it’s earlier loss to Virginia.

tough for a freshman to fill the

Davis is more than equal to the

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

While many students probably are not aware of the
severity of the situation, the faculty will decide next
week the outcome of a very crucial debate—whether
or not to keep the independent exam system.

Many of the faculty have serious doubts concerning
whether the independent exam system puts a strain
on the honor system. These doubts seem to be
strengthened by the increased and more open cases of
cheating and stealing evident in recent years. When
students’ course books (as well as their class notes)
are being stolen from crowded areas such as the
library, dining hall and co-op, there is little wonder.
people are beginning to worry about the honor
system. In its search for ways to save the honor
system, the faculty may very well throw out the in-
dependent exam system.

Why” According to some taculty members
students have taken exams in rooms other than the
designated ones; students have taken exams in Mc-
Cormick Library; students taking an exam in an
earlier period have given helpful information to
students taking the same exam in a later period. Yet,
the faculty turns in very few of the suspected viola-
tions because they have had little confidence in the
student Executive Committee.

The faculty has not really understood what con-
stitutes a violation of the independent exam system
because past EC’s have not made it clear. This year’s
EC is attempting to do so.

Granted, some changes must be made to strengthen
our honor system, but getting rid of independent ex-
ams would do more harm than good. Independent ex-
ams are a fringe benefit of the honor system. Because
of the honor system, we can enjoy such privileges as
independent exams, along with supposedly being able
to leave our books and belongings anywhere on cam-
pus without the fear of their being taken. If one of
these privileges are taken away, then the value of the
honor system will be diminished. In fact, the need of
an honor system at Washington and Lee will become
suspect, because their vote will be construed to mean
that an effective one doesn’t exist.

For most of the students at Washington and Lee, the
honor system works. Most of the students were
gentlemen before they came here and the honor
system is only a reinforcement of and proof that a
special set of ideals is common to this campus. Viola-
tions occur and will continue to occur as long as this
University is attended by human beings. As one ad-
ministration official put it, ““The mere fact that there
is a need for an honor system should tell us dishonesty
exists and will continue to exist.”

Independent exams are relatively new, being in-
corporated into the honor system in the early ‘70’s.
The honor system did exist in the past without in-
dependent exams, but it is doubtful whether it could
continue now without them. To the present body of
students, independent exams are as integral a part of
the honor system as lying, cheating and stealing are
not. They view the honor system as an institution with

_independent exams now one of the corner stones, even
though they were not originally so. To remove that

- assumed cornerstone would put the whole venerable
insitution in danger of crumbling.

The honor system with independent exams is ob-

-viously not a perfect system. Violations occur. In-
dependent exams may provide a temptation for some
students to cheat, but they are students who would
find some way to cheat if independent exams were
taken away. The blame for the shortcomings of the
honor system cannot be put upon independent exams.
The honor system with or without independent ex-
ams, can be likened to what Winston Churchill once
said about democracy, “It is the worst form of
government to come along up to now—except for
everything else.’’ To the present body, the honor
system with independent exams is the best thing to
come along in a long time, and an honor system
without independent exams will be regarded as
something definitely worse. jm.g.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry

Oct. 21, 1977
Dear Sirs:

Earlier this fall an up-
perclassman told me, by way of
encouragement, that the Phi
‘twas really bad last year.”’ It
was a small encouragement. I
would like to offer you, in turn,
some encouragement: some of
your articles are truly in-
teresting. Perhaps if you were
to print only the interesting
ones, you could leap-frog, as it
were, ahead in your improve-
ment process. I notice by your
masthead that you have
assembled an impressive group
of editors. One stratagem I
have seen used by other am-
bitious newspapers is to have
one or two reporters on the
staff, whose task it is to
cultivate reliable sources of in-
teresting information.

The fact that three events oc-
curred on the same night at
W&L was interesting, and I ap-
preciated your story and in-
vestigation. However, I wonder
if it was a bit immodest, after
all, to use an entire column,
especially since it was an acci-
dent and may not happen
again? A modest paragraph or
two bringing this eratorical con-
junction to our attention might
have been more appropriate.

I noticed, also, that there was
a “sleeper” in the same Oc-
tober 20 Phi, lurking in a
clothing store advertisement.
Did any of your other readers
pick this one Up? I refer to the
“synthetic down” coat, a pro-
duct novel to my experience. It
would be very interesting, to
this reader at least, if your
reporters could go to Adair Hut-
ton for the story on the synthetic
ducks that yield these feathers.

Respectfully,
George Planansky

Dear Editor:

I must use this rather inap-
propriate forum to express my
apologies to the Washington and
Lee community in general and
certain faculty members in par-
ticular. The apology stems from
two articles that I wrote earlier

 

this month
Homecoming.

Through inept journalism
practices, I mistated the pro-
cedure of selecting the
Homecoming Queen and I cast
some doubt as to how much the
judges actually work. Ac-
cording to Dr. Shillington, the
work involved in the selection
process is grueling. Also, by
editorializing too much, I
disparaged the long-standing
institution of Homecoming. For
these lacks of discretion, I must
apologize to the W&L com-
munity.

I must apologize to Dr.
Hamer for not listing him and
giving him his due recognition
as a judge. I must apologize to
Dr. Shillington for referring to
his presentation of the
homecoming Queen as planting
‘“‘big wet smackers’’ thus
possibly insulting him. Both
these oversights were uninten-
tional which were due to bad
reporting on the one hand and
inconsiderate overuse of my
authority as a reporter on the
other.

concerning

Regretfully,
Ned McDonnell, ‘80

Oct. 21, 1977
Editor:

In reference to the 10/20 let-
ter of “‘transfer student’ ike
Brown, I have but one observa-
tion: I’m sure that if all those
“hose queens” from our il-
lustrious neighboring schools
saw your letter they would all
come rushing to you because of
your concepts on dating and
girls.

Tranferringly yours,
George Fagan

 

 

Editor’s Note:

Please have all _ editorial
replies and rebuttals typed. It
will assist the staff in getting
your letter published more effi-
ciently and quickly.

 

The Ring-tum Phi will have a
staff meeting today at 7 p.m. in
its office in the student center.
All reporters should be there to
receive assignments. Any other
persons interested in reporting
news or sports are invited to
come. Reporters are needed
badly. If you have time, you can
help.

year and a year book. Both
organizations have money left
over to put in a reserve fund to
improve their services, he said.

The vice president of the
Publication Board, Jeffery
Bird, noted that there was ‘‘a lot
of crap published during the six-
ties” when the editor and
business manager of the Phi
were unpaid.

The motion was voted down
8-3, with one abstension.

Following this vote about 75
per cent of the audience left,
many with conspicuous smiles.

George Griffin, vice president
of the EC, entered the motion to
clarify student and faculty
responsibilities regarding in-
dependent exams. The motion
recommended that exams be
taken in a specified location and
that the faculty require 24-hour
notice from a student wishing to
change an exam time. It also
recommended that someone be
present to pass out and collect
exams.

Goddard suggested that the

EC pass rigid guidelines con-
cerning punctuality in picking
up and returning exams but this
was rejected by the committee
because most members felt this
would encroach on the faculty’s
responsibilities.

The motion was approved by
11 representatives while God-
dard abstained. ‘

In other business it was an-
nounced that at next week’s
meeting two people would be
selected for the Courses and
Degrees Committee, one for the
Student Health Committee and
two for the Library Advisory
Committee.

The EC also announced that
the Board of Trustees will raise
the student activity fee to $45
per year starting in the next
academic year. Underhill said
the fee would have to be raised
to $50 per year in 1980 because
of the Mock Convention. Addi-
tionally, the EC agreed to look
into a proposal by Missal that
EC funds be put into interest
bearing accounts.

He felt his department was in

Professor Turner voiced his
favor for the present system,
adding that he saw no real pro-
blems with it. Turner added no
one in his department had ex-
pressed sentiments against in-
dependent exams.

Politics

Acting department head Pin-
ney felt the general tone in his
department was for the con-
tinuation of independent exams.
Pinney added that there was a
poor response rate on the Facul-
ty EC questionaire about in-
dependent exams. He felt those
teachers most dissatisfied with
the present system did not get
to fill out a questionaire.

Psychology

Professor Jarrard was in
favor of retaining independent
exams, and he felt the members
of his department were in
agreement with him. One pro-
blem Jarrard saw with the pre-
sent system was the problems
incurred by teachers when
students call to change exams
at the last minute.

dependent exams, but he added
that there is no other practical
way to administer exams under
our present curriculum. He ad-
ded independent exams would
be better if they functioned as
had been initially intended.

Sociology

Professor Kimbrough said he
was basically in favor of the
present system, but that he sees
a degeneration in the main-
teanance of independent ex-
ams. He sees a lapse in the
original plan as irresponsibility
on the part of the past few
generations of the EC. He
believes the EC should become
more involved in the physical
oversee of exams, making sure
all established guidelines are
adhered to.

During Monday night’s EC
meeting several EC members
said they thought it was up to
the independent teachers to set
up guidelines for taking exams.

Likewise, it was up to the EC to
make sure the rules surroun-
ding exam-taking were enforc-
ed. Following discussion, the
EC passed a resolution about in-
dependent exams which stated:

1) All exams will be taken
where designated by the pro-
fessor.

2) The individual faculty
members’ should _ specify
penalties for the late submis-
sion of exams.

3) The EC should attempt to
orient students as to uniform
policies surrounding the taking
of exams.

4) If a student wants to
change an exam time he should
notify the teacher not later than
24 hours before he is scheduled
to take it.

The faculty EC will make a
suggestion to the faculty as a
whole whether or not to retain
independent exams at the facul-
ty meeting November 7. The
faculty will then vote on the
Faculty EC suggestion.

the faculty acknowledged sup-
port for the present administer-
ing of exams.

On the question of suspected
cheating on exams, almost all
the faculty had heard second
hand of cases of cheating on ex-
ams. However, only two pro-
fessors had first hand
knowledge of students cheating,
and those were isolated cases.

Finally, all of the faculty
believed there could be an
honor system without indepen-
dent exam, being their reason-
ing on the fact that there was an
honor system at W&L without
independent exams up to 1970.
Also, most professors viewed
the independent exam schedule
as a privilege, not a necessary
part of the honor system.
However, some of the faculty
members asked were of the opi-
nion that the honor system
would be weakened if the in-
dependent exams were not
kept. One professor said it
would make the honor system
at W&L more trival. Another
said that taking away a
privilege like independent ex-
amss would weaken the honor
system in the students’ eyes,
whether or not it truly would be
detrimental to W&L’s honor
code.

The honor code at Washington
and Lee is safe, and will remain
that way for a great while. The
independent exam schedule,
however, is a new addition and
more vulnerable. It appears,
though, that the faculty
members are generally in sup-
port of the independent exam
system and will vote to retain it
in their faculty meeting
November 7th.

fee tax. Although the Executive
Committee gave the lasw school
only about 80 per cent of its stu-
dent activity fee, that still
represented almost a $4,000
gain for the law school com-
pared to the previous academic
year’s allotment. Most of that
$4,000 came at the expense of
the SAB’s budget.

Friday’s party, featuring a
varied selection of popular
tunes and seven kegs of beer,
was sponsored jointly by the
SAB and the Student Bar
Association, the representative
body of the law school. The SAB
paid for 75 per cent of the cost,
while the SAB chipped in 25 per
cent.

Originally, there were sup-

posed to be only five kegs of
beer at the party but the
weather was so good an unex-
pectedly large turnout made the
SAB decide to purchase two
more kegs. One student
estimated that about 200 per-
sons were at the party at one
time or another. SAB.members
had no estimates.

‘*People enjoyed
themselves,” said one party-
goer. SAB members cited an
impromptu football game and
frisbee throwing as evidence of
this observation. ‘“‘There was a
carnival atmosphere. It was a
good way to relax after a week
of midterms,” one student said.

The next SAB function? SAB
secretary Tom McCarthy said
the organization is kicking
around the idea of a ‘‘miniature

concert’”’ sometime in the mid-
die of November. He emphasiz-
ed, however, that the idea had
only been discussed; nothing
definite has been planned.

EC Calls SAB
To Testify

by Lee Howard

If the co-chairmen and the
treasurer of the Student Ac-
tivities Board have not com-
plied with Executive Commit-
tee requirements for strict ac-
counting guidelines and the pro-
curement of night deposit bags,
the EC will ‘‘have to go into ex-
ecutive session’’ because that
would be an “automatic honor
violation,” said Rick Goddard
at Monday’s EC meeting.

dard, senior law _ represen-
tative, asking co-chairman

Town -

Cars
Towed

by Tom Salley

This past Saturday, Parents’
Weekend, at least five cars
were towed by the Lexington
Police Department from spaces
adjacent to school property.
The owner of each car was fined
$5 for parking in a restricted
zone, in this case beside Gilliam
Dormitory on Washington
Street, and charged an addi-
tional $12 as a towing fee.

Chief James Kirby of the Lex-
ington Police Department said
that at the time the cars were
towed there were 22 of 30 park-
ing spaces open in the front gym
parking lot. He said that his
department had been in the
practice of placing safety cones
in the restricted areas but had
discontinued this method
because too many cones were
being stolen. Street signs and
painted curbs now indicate the
restricted parking areas along
Washington Street.

The Development Office of
Washington and Lee, in con-
junction with the University’s
Proctor’s Office, had informed
the Police Department last
week that this past weekend
would be busy; crowded with
visiting parents.

They denied, however, that
there is any sort of verbal
agreement between the school
and the police department
about overlooking parking
violations on big weekends, and
they were not surprised to hear

_ af the towings, ,

Foreman to appear before the
EC to show they have followed
the guidelines passed
unanimously, 11-0. Jack Bovay,
junior EC representative and
ad hoc member of the SAB said
he believes that, as of Monday
night, the SAB had not been
keeping receipts and had not ar-
ranged for night deposit bags.
However, all EC members
contacted refused to consider
making lack of adherence to the
guidelines the basis for an
honor violation. When the EC
passed its guidelines at its first
meeting in September, Goddard

VP Says Contact “Deceptive”

by Jim Barnes and Lee Howard

Ten to 12 Contact members
were treated to at least a $115
dinner with Bruce Jenner and
his wife last Spring, Contact co-
chairmen Billy Webster and
Walter Granruth have confirm-
ed.

Also, approximately $500 was
held over from last year’s
budget and passed on to this
year’s administration, Webster
said, contrary to a two year old
Executive Committee order
specifically directing that all
unused Contact funds be return-
ed to the Central Student Body

Gown Relations
Mayor Talks Noise

In an effort to get at the story
behind the news, the Ring-tum
Phi interviewed the two highest
ranking officials of Lexington’s
city government. The mayor, Dr.
Charles F. Phillips Jr., is

ultimately responsible for all city

policy. The city manager, Mr.
John V. Dane, is the appointed
official responsible for the actual
day-to-day operation of the city's
administration and services. Both
were interviewed by Ring-tum
Phi staff reporter Randy Smith.

In conversations last seek
with Lexington’s mayor Dr.
Charles F. Phillips, and city
manager John V..Doane, the
Ring-tum Phi discovered that
relations between Washington
and Lee students and the Lex-
ington townspeople are
‘‘generally good,’’ at least in the
minds of those two influential
city administrators.

Mayor Phillips said that he
‘‘refused to believe’’ that rela-
tions between the town and the
students were not good because
of earlier problems this year
concerning the city’s noise or-
dinance. ‘‘I don’t think relations
are even really strained,’’ Dr.
Phillips replied to further in-
quiry. (Sigma Phi Epsilon and
Phi Gamma Delta fraternities
were fined $10 each in court ac-
tions resulting from violation of
Lexington city ordinance 15-32,
Section B, which pertains to ex-
cessive noise heard after 11
p.m.; both violations occurred
during W&L’s Homecoming
Weekend. )

City manager, John Doane,
believes that the relations bet-
ween the town and the students
has been ‘‘somewhat strained—
and that is unfortunate,’’ but he
does not see ‘‘any long run

Fund at the end of each
academic year, according to
EC President Jim Underhill.

Although Webster stated that
the dinner could have cost up to
$130, our sources of information
claim the dinner only cost $115.
Granruth, who would neither
confirm or deny the cost of the
dinner, asked, ‘‘What is your
source for this information?”
However, he acknowledged the
dinner did take place. Last
year’s co-chairman John Bruch
said the dinners may have in-
cluded Contact members’
dates.

Granruth said that the $500
figure was “‘inflated,”’ but he
refused to release the specific
sum that remained in the Con-
tact account during the sum-
mer. According to section IX of
the Student Body Constitution,
subsection B, point 5, ‘‘All other
net profits from organizations
participating in the Student Ac-
tivity Fee shall revert to the
Central Student Body Fund.”’ So
any amount of money held over
in the Contact account would be
a violation of the constitution.

Underhill, when informed

about the dinner said ‘I think
that’s something we should ap-
prove. What we give them
money for is to bring speakers
to the campus, not to have par-
ties with them.’’ Our sources in-
dicate the dinner was held at
the College Inn. Webster
defended the dinner by saying it
was held in lieu of a party which
he believes Contact members
deserved.

Both Underhill and EC vice
president George Griffin said
that the $500 was not reported
as potential revenues when Con-
tact submitted this year’s
budget. Griffin said the EC took
money away from Ariel and
gave it to Contact without being
informed that Contact had the
extra $500. “If they knew they
had the money and they didn’t
include it in revenues, then they
were being deceptive,” Griffin
said.

Granruth said that the $500
which was held over was
necessary for the operation of
Contact over the summer and in
the fall before Contact received
any funds from the EC, the In-

Dalton Wins
Mock Election

The Republican candidates
for governor, lieutenant gover-
nor and attorney general made
a clean sweep of a Mock Elec-
tion sponsored by the Ring-tum
Phi on Monday.

Republican gubernatorial
candidate John H. Dalton had
the largest margin of victory,
beating Democrat Henry
Howell with 61 per cent of the
vote, 114 to 74. However,
Howell’s 39 per cent of the vote
was better than he has fared at
mock elections in most other
Virginia schools, particularly
James Madison University
where he received less than 30
per cent.

Dalton fared slightly worse
among persons residing in
Virginia, winning 59 per cent of
the vote to Howell’s 41 per cent.
However, among Washington
and Lee students residing in
Virginia, Dalton won by a 2-1
ratio. Dalton had 46 votes to
Howell’s 23 from_ in-state
students.

The faculty, however gave 10
of its 12 votes to Howell, or 83
per cent. Despite the fact
Democratic lieutenant guber-
natorial candidate Charles
Robb lost, the faculty gave him

90.9 per cent of its vote, com-
pared to Republican Joe
Canada’s 9.1 per cent. However,
the faculty did favor
Republican attorney general
candidate Marshall Coleman by
a 6-5 margin over Democratic
challenger Ed Lane.

Overall, Canada edged out
Robb 85 votes to 79, or 51 per
cent to 49 per cent. Also, Col-
eman beat Lane 81-67, 55 per
cent to 45 per cent.

An interesting sidelight is
that, of the Dalton supporters,
55 per cent were fraternity
members, while Howell sup-
porters were predominantly in-
dependents’ Almost 57 per cent
of Howell voters were in-
dependents, only 43 per cent
were fraternity members. It
was hypothesized that the
reason for this is that fraternity
members tend to be richer than
independents, and it is a known
fact that Republicans tend to be
richer than the average person.

Lee Howard, news editor of
the Phi and organizer of the
Mock Election called the tur-
nout of 190 ‘great. We usually
don’t have that many people
vote in student elections, which
are much more important.”’
Page 2, Ring-tum Phi, Nov. 3, 1977

 

The Student Control Commit-
tee will not allow marijuana
smoking in the dorms this year.

So far this year the Student
Control Committee (SCC) has
heard only one case involving
pot smoking in the dorms. The
individual accused was found
guilty and assessed a penalty of
social probation for a period of
two weeks. According to SCC
chairman Jim MeNider, if
smoking becomes prevalent in
the dorms, penalties will
become more severe aS a
deterent.

MeNider said that this year’s
SCC will decide on its own
policies. He added that this
year’s SCC does not feel con-
strained by the minimum penal-
ty for pot smoking implemented
by last year’s SCC. Last year
the SCC established a minimum
penalty of a $50 fine, two weeks
social probation, and a letter
home to the offender’s parents
for smoking pot in the dorms.
MeNider said that it was possi-
ble that this year’s SCC could
establish an even more severe
minimum penalty if smoking
cases before the SCC become
more frequent.

MeNider added that this does
not mean that the SCC will be
handing out more severe
penalties in its next pot case.
However, he added that the SCC
was not going to let pot smoking
become a problem. He said the
SCC wants to eliminate pot
smoking in the dorms entirely
and that the SCC is not going to
let an occasional incident go by
with a mere slap on the wrist.
McNider made it clear that it
was up to the SCC to decide
what constituted occasional
violations of the smoking rule.

McNider states that when the
SCC receives a report from a
dorm conselor about a student
smoking pot, he undertakes an
initial investigation, gathering
information surrounding the
violation. If the facts indicate a
violation, the student is notified
when to appear before the Com-
mittee. Meanwhile McNider

 

SCC policies
on pot smoking

assembles the information sur-
rounding the violation into
coherent form to be presented
to the committee as a whole.
When the student appears
before the SCC, the SCC will in-
itially determine whether or not
to consider the complaint. If the
SCC votes to consider the case,
it will ‘‘undertake sufficient in-
vestigation to make a finding on
the complaint.’’ When the SCC
decides on a penalty, the stu-
dent is notified as soon as possi-
ble about the SCC’s decision.

If a student feels the penalty
assessed was too severe, he
may appeal the committee’s
penalty to the Student Affairs
Committee (SAC). This com-
mittee, made up of faculty and
students, can not reverse a guil-
ty finding of the SCC, it can
merely soften penalties handed
out by the SCC. The SAC must
receive appeals in written form
within 48 hours of the SCC’s
decision. The SAC will also hear
a case if three or more
members of the SCC feel the
SCC’s penalty was to harsh or
too lenient.

Penalties the SCC can assess
vary from monetary fines and
reprimands to a suggestion of
suspension from the university.
Such a suggestion for suspen-
sion must be approved by the
SAC. The maximum monetary
fine the SCC can levee is $50, not
including any damages the stu-
dent may have caused during
his misconduct. The most wide-
ly used penalties are social pro-
bation, where students are
restricted from participating in
university social events, and
dormitory probation, where
students are prohibited from
entering dorms from 8 a.m. un-
til midnight.

McNider emphasized that
marijuana cases makes up only
a small fraction of the total
cases the board hears. The ma-
jority of the cases the commit-
tee decides on involve other
types of student misconduct, in-
cluding mischief down the road.

ter Fraternity Council, or
parents. He listed the rental of a
post office box, phone bills and
other incidentals as justifica-
tion for having this reserve
fund.

Underhill and Griffin both
said that this procedure was
wrong. Underhill said that Con-
tact should have paid bills out of
their own pockets and kept
receipts for these expenses and
brought them to the EC for
reimbursement at the beginn-
ing of the academic year. Grif-
fin said that all other organiza-
tions are in the same position
that Contact is in at the beginn-
ing of the fall term, and he sees

rapped

no reason why Contact should
be the only organization to have
a reserve fund.

Underhill, when informed of
Contact’s ‘$500 fund,” and the
Jenner dinner, said that this
year’s, and perhaps some of
last year’s, co-chairmen would
be requested to appear before
the EC Monday night to explain
their handling of Contact’s
finances. Underhill said, ‘“We’ll
have to look at this in the same
light that we are looking into the
SAB.” He also said that the EC
may subtract from Contact’s
current budget a sum equal to
ihe amount of money kept in the
reserve fund over the summer.

Touring group presents

Journey Into Blackness”

Voices, Inc., America’s only
year round coast to coast
theater, will come to Lee
Chapel next Wednesday at 8
o’clock. The acting troupe,

devoted to educa-
tional/musical theater, will
present ‘‘Journey into

Blackness.”’ This play, like the
“Time Tunnel’ takes the
viewer on a fourth dimensional
voyage throughout the two hun-
dred year history of the black
man in America. The actors
and actresses present the
“from slavery to the future”’
itinerary through a fast-paced
combination of group and solo
singing, choreographed move-
ment, and brief dramatic se-
quences. ‘‘Journey into
Darkness,’ designed to in-

crease the general awareness of
the black man’s plight in the US
and black goals and aspira-
tions, has a cast of eight singers

‘Most white students are ig-
norant to what black students
are all about,’’ declared Ardith
Collins, secretary for the Stu-
dent Association for Black Uni-
ty, (better known as SABU
around the W&L campus) For
this reason, explained Collins,
SABU serves not only to in-
crease the degree of black
awareness among black
students but within the white
community as well.

Otherwise, SABU serves as a
social outlet for all but two of
the blacks at Washington and
Lee. SABU’s social calendar
climaxes with the wintertime
Black Ball. Invitations are ex-
tended to all members of the ad-
ministration, the blacks at
W&L, and president Huntley.
The music is varied between
jazz and disco.

Collins pointed out that SABU
also pushes, and will continue to
do so, for more extensive
recruitment, along the lines of
affirmative action, of black
students. Collins, skeptical
about the utility of using black-
oriented majors as an incentive
to expand the presently small
segment of Negroes at W&L (of
1.5% of the student body), said,
“I don’t think many people
would major in Black Studies.”’
Collins elaborated by saying he
would enjoy the opportunity to
take some courses in black
studies. The SABU secretary
admitted, in part, that, as bad
as the racial imbalance may be,
the situation may be impossible
to ameliorate owing to the
“backward’’ nature of the
school.

Collins stated that SABU, in
conjunction with other
organizations, may try to inten-
sify black awareness around
Lexington by hosting or co-
hosting black speakers. Collins
felt that the prospects of im-
plementing this program were
tenuous, at best, owing to the
fact that SABU is a non-due
paying organization and
desired speakers such as Bar-
bara Jordan, would require
honorarium fees.

students

their equipment including a
large storage rack were pur-
chased with a $1,000 grant from
the EC. Of this money the $15
left over is being used as a
maintenance fund.

The canoes and their equip-
ment are kept in the basement
of the Military Science building.

IFC Weekend To Feature
Shirelles and Rhondels

by G. T. Woodsmell and R. P.
Burnbreath

Interfraternity Council (IFC)
Weekend will featureThe
Shirelles and Bill Deal and The
Rhondels Friday night, and on
Sunday afternoon, Freddy
Goodhart’s Second Hand Band,
both at the Pavillion.

Fifty kegs of beer will be
taped at 8:30 Friday night, and
the bands are scheduled to
begin about nine, playing until
one. Saturday has been left
open and up to the individual
fraternity houses to celebrate
according to their own tastes.
The Executive Committee has
teamed up with the IFC to pro-
vide ‘‘at least’’ ten kegs of suds
Sunday, along with bluegrass
tunes; weather permitting, the
affair will be outside.

IFC Social Chairman, John
Gordon, described The Shirelles

as “an early 60’s band that
plays late 50’s music.” .The
Shirelles consist of three female
vocalists with a backup band.
Their biggest hit single was
“Solider Boy,’’ which sold three
million copies 15 years ago.

Gordon described Bill Deal
and The Rhondels as “a
nightclub performance band
playing assorted music with a
good light show.”” He emphasiz-
ed that the bands are com-
plimentary in style, but appeal
toa wide variety of taste.

Funds financining IFC
Weekend originated from three
sources: fraternity fines levied
for rush infractions; freshmen
rush registration fees; and each
fraternity’s IFC dues. The two
bands playing Friday night cost
a total of $2,750; beer expenses
will amount to $1,475. the foam

will be featured in 24 oz. paper
vessels.

Sunday afternoon’s bluegrass
bonus was arranged through
Executive Committee urging,

and will be jointly sponsored by
the IFC and the EC. Freddy
Goodhart’s Second Hand Band
will perform . Sunday from 2-4.
The event will be open to the en-

tire student body free of charge.

The weekend was described
by the IFC social chairman as

“‘a function of deferred rush”

for freshmen who have not yet

joined fraternities. Gordon add-
ed that Friday night’s event
would be one of the few remain-
ing opportunities for unpledged
freshmen to see fraternities ‘‘as
they really are.” The charge of
non-fraternity members to gain
admission Friday night will be
$3 per couple. Tickets will not
be sold at the gate.

university engineer Thomas
Tinsley.

“‘As of now, we haven’t been
able to correct the problem
because of its irregular oc-
curences,’”’ said Tinsley, who
graduated from W&L in 1975.
‘“‘We will try to wait until the
Thanksgiving break before we
try to repair it. If we tried to fix
it now, the station would have to
go off the air.’’ He added that
difficulties always seem to co-
rect themselves without help
from him and there is no need to
find a solution immediately.

Tinsley went on to say that he
was not aware that students had
discovered any problems with
the station and because the pro-
blems are relatively minor, he
sees no reason to fix it now.
“Actually, last Thursday night
was the first time I had any dif-
ficulty picking up the radio sta-
tion. I was listening to my
stereo and for a brief time,

reception was poor. Eventually,
the problem corrected itself.’’

Station manager Michael
Lavitt agreed with Tinsley that
the problem was a minor one
and that it would be better to
wait until Thanksgiving break
to repair it. “If we were to
repair it now, we would have to
get off the air for two or three
days,” he said. “If it gets any
worse, we will get off the air
and try to repair it but in the
meantime, we will stay on and
continue to serve the public.”

Tinsley refused to discuss the
situation any more because ac-
cording to him, ninty-nine out of
100 students wouldn’t unders-
tand anyway. This is a very
minor problem that we can
solve by ourselves.’’ He added
that he wished the Ring-tum Phi
staff would spend more time
looking into relevant matters
and not harrass the radio sta-
tion about trivial events.

Law students vote
to restrict undergrad
use of Law Library

by Jim Ingham

A new policy dealing with
undergraduate use of the law
library has been given an af-
firmative vote by law students.
This policy forbids
undergraduate use of the
library within two weeks of law
exams and places out-of-bounds
the upper level and carrels to
undergrads. The new policy
took place immediately after it

had won in a run-off Monday .

against a more restrictive
policy.

The new policy, formerly pro-
posal B, requires that all
undergrads act appropriately in

Washing Machines Coming Soon?

by Kevin Dwyer

Four new washers and four
dryers for the Graham-Lee
Laundry Room may be in the of-
fing in the very near future, ac-
cording to eshman class Presi-
dent Dutch Waldbauer.
Waldbauer spoke with Jerry
Darrel, manager of the Cockpit,
Dining Hall and the Co-op as
well as the laundry service.

Darrel wants assurances that
new machines would stay in
good shape, and that all equip-
ment, both old and new would

be secure from use by those not
of the university community.
One possible plan would in-
clude locking the room from
midnight to 8 a.m. and having
keys available from freshman
class officers. This plan is ten-
tative and subject to approval
from the university department
of Buildings and Grounds.
Some who use the facilities
seem to throw their trash (i.e.,
lint and empty laundry soap
boxes, etc.) on the floor, despite
the fact that there is easy ac-
cessibility to trash cans in the

room. ‘‘Keeping the room clean
is essential” in getting new
machines, according to
Waldbauer. He recently clean-
ed the room, and placed signs
warning of damage to the
machines if they are overload-
ed.

Many items of unclaimed
clothing clutter the tables in the
laundry room. These items will
be turned over to Lexington
charities if not removed by Fri-
day, November 17, says
Waldbauer.

When the new machines are
installed, there will be eight of
each, and this should provide
enough open machines so as to
avoid the overcrowding that has
occurred in the past. Waldbauer
has two suggestions for those
who use the machines. 1. Wash
more often. Washing often
means small loads which will
not damage the machines, and
therefore efficiency will be at
its peak. 2. Wash in the off
hours, such as late at night
because fewer will be waiting to
use the machines.

the law library without disturb-
ing anyone. Law students and
those engaged in legal research
still have primary use of the
facilities. The proposal also
states that all private carrels
are out, and that undergrad use
is restricted to the few lounges
and empty carrels in the
library.

Proposal B won in the second
referendum after a three-way
split developed in the first
referendum. 75 voted for B in
the first go round, while 71
voted for the more restrictive A
and 26 for no policy at all. Since
a majority was required, there
was a run-off between Plan A
and Plan B. Plan B won 89-70.

Student Bar Association
President Ray Leven said the
referenda should ‘‘Tell people
where we stand.’’ He said that
after some complaints were
voiced, the SBA came up with a
plan that is more restrictive
than the final draft. Policy B
was devised as an alternative to
the older Policy A by the
presidents of the three law
classes. After open meetings
and much debate, Plan B was
voted in, Leven said

Leven said that the law
students wanted cooperation
from the undergrads and their
guarentee that they would not
take advantage of their op-
portunities. Leven also said that
there really isn’t ‘‘a lot of study
room.’’ The main reading room
is for research only, and most of
the carrels are by nature
private.

Leven also wanted to point
out that the whole decision pro-
cess was ‘‘no underhanded
deal.”’ He stressed that all par-
ties interested had a say in the
final decision, and that it was
derived in a fair and legitimate

‘way.

THE NOSE KNOWS

Two revealing stories from
Monday’s EC meeting:

The SAB will not give old
Pumpkinhead an SAB card to
get into all the SAB events
because they say he doesn’t do
enough work. Ah, _ those
curators of W&L tricks and
treats! They’re the type of peo-
ple who would go around
smashing Jack o’ Lanterns on
Halloween. Come to think of it,
the EC meeting was only a day
after the goblins came out. But
are there some skeletons in the
closet? Stay tuned next week
when you may hear the awful

‘*Rose Garden”

The

by Seth Oserin

This week the Lyric will be
showing “I Never Promised
You a Rose Garden,”’ starring
Kathleen Quinlan and Bibi
Andersson. It is about a young
girl (Quinlan) who cannot cope
with life, and thus produces a
fantasy world of her own into
which she escapes, and in which
she suffers.

The setting of a mental
hospital brings about thoughts
of ‘‘One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s
Nest,”’ and, naturally, thoughts
of comparisons. Well, if you
were wondering, ‘‘Rose
Garden’’ has superior written
all over it. Next to
this, ‘‘Cuckoo’s Nest” is nothing

howl of everyone getting the
axe.

The SAB wants to can two of
its members for now showing
up to meetings. You can’t find a
sinecure anywhere nowadays.
Not even with those happy-go-
lucky members of the Students
Activities Board. Of course, by
the end of Monday’s EC
meeting there may be no one
left except the members who
don’t show up. Let’s hope not.
We need people who can get
quality performers like Archie
Bell and the Drips to come to
W&L.

Land of

more than sacharrin, and Jack
Nicholson’s performance is
vanilla pudding. However, in all
fairness, it must be mentioned
that “Rose Garden” is a
realist’s presentation with a
realist’s main character, while

‘‘Cuckoo’s Nest’’ centers
around a_eromanticist’s
character.

There are only two problems
with the production. The first is
the over-exposed film that
director Anthony Page uses to
depict the patient’s hallucina-
tions. While this was a clever
deviation from the usual blur-
out-blur-in, the effect eventual-
ly proved to be annoying. This,
however could be intentional.

ENTERTAINMENT

Citizen Kane:
Welles to be screened

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor
Next Tuesday, November 8,
the journalism department is
bringing to Reid Hall 203 the
one film that a constant majori-
ty of cinema critics and affi-
cionados seem able to call ‘‘the
greatest’ with a clear cons-
cience. That film is Citizen
Kane; in the opinion of many it
is quite simply the greatest
movie ever made.

The guiding genius of Kane
was, of course, its director and
star, Orson Welles. Still seen oc-
casionally on television talk-
shows and specials, Welles was
the ‘‘wonder boy”’ of the enter-
tainment industry in the late
1930’s. He and his Mercury
Players ~— Joseph Cotten,
Agnes Moorehead, and others
— literally shook the country
with their radio broadcast of
The War of the Worlds, and
their popularity was assured.

The genesis of Citizen Kane
was simple. RKO studio was in
great danger of bankruptcy at
that time, and Welles was
brought to Hollywood to come
up with a “miracle.” He came
on the guarantee of total
freedom—the ability to try new
techniques in cinematography
(like those odd camera angles)
and, even more, a controversial
story. Wells, in Kane, plays out
the life of the famous ‘‘yellow
journalist’? and would-be
political leader, William Ran-
dolph Hearst. All of these fac-
tors combined gave RKO their
miracle, though certainly not a
financial one.

Hearst couldn’t stop the
film’s release, try as he might.
But he could (and did) make
things so hot all over the coun-
try that hardly any movie house
booked Kane. By the time this
died down, the picture had got-
ten so much bad PR that au-
diences avoided it—and the
result was, at first, relative
failure, until the fifties and

SOOO OOOD

Oz

with the effect used to relay to
the viewer the irritation, sterili-
ty and furiousness of the girl’s
life.

The other problem is Bibi
Andersson, who plays the young
girl’s psychiatrist. Whether it is
the director’s or the actress’
fault, the psychiatrist comes
across too blase and easy-going.
Nothing seems to bother her.
This doesn’t work with the cons-
tant strain she is supposed to be
under.

Most all of the rest of the ac-
ting is excellent, but, un-
doubtedly, the main highlight of
the movie is the performance of

(continued on page 12)

 

overwhelming success with a
new audience.

Citizen Kane is Welles,
masterpiece—his first film at
an early age, made in 1940-41.
But why? Above all, Welles
had, in the Mercury Players, a
group he could depend upon as a
novice director. And secondly,
his exuberance brought dozens
of people to his door in
Hollywood—people who had
wanted to try new ideas. The
combination was stellar.

But, as modern critic Pauline
Kael says: “‘It is difficult to ex-
plain what makes any great
work great...maybe more so
withCitizen Kane than with
other great movies, because it
isn’t a work of special depth or a
work of subtle beauty. It is a
shallow work, a_ shallow
masterpiece. Like most of the
films of the sound era that are
called masterpieces, Citizen
Kane has reached its audience
gradually over the years rather
than at the time of release. Yet,
unlike the others, it is conceived
an acted as entertainment in a
popular style...to pretend that
it’s profound is to miss what
makes it such an American

 

an actor’s and a director’s film
—above all, a ‘‘popular”’
masterpiece. The key to this
film is to appreciate it for its in-
novative quality, but enjoy if for
its gut appeal, too. Favorite
scenes: that great death scene
with the glass paperweight; the
political rally in Kane’s bid for
President — Wells loved
‘“‘srandstand” scenes like this;
the ‘‘breakfast room’’ scenes,
covering a period of 9 years and
the gradual deterioration of
Kane’s first marriage in a few
seconds; and, above all, the
scenes at Xanadu, and Kane’s
second wife with her jigsaw
puzzle—which serves as_ the
central metaphor of the film.
The memorable scenes, one-
liners, jokes and_ effective
camera angles form a tremen-
dous list, Anyone who has seen
Citizen Kane has their own
favorites. But, suffice it to say
that this is a rich film — im-
mensely entertaining, while at
the same time a casebook study
on the ‘“‘nuts and bolts”’ of film-
making. It’s only in Reid Hall
for one night—next Tuesday at 7
& 9 p.m’ Don,t miss it—anyone
who has seen Citizen Kane

triumph —
So this is Citizen Kane —botn

before will agree on that point.

Eye and Ear:
from the Bookstore

It’s unusual that, in what will
probably go down in history as
the great age of rock and roll,
very few people today are ac-
tually listening to rock and roll.
Today we have instead “‘heavy
metal,”’ disco, folk-country
rock, and, as always, jazz. Not
that there is anything wrong
with these types of music, oh no.
It’s just that there is also a need
for honest rock and roll which is
found in increasingly rarer
sources.

For today’s true rock and roll
fans there are very few choices.
You can listen to early (or prac-
tically any) Beatles, or you can
listen to two new, somewhat
linked albums. For those of you
who haven’t heard, the Animals
have gotten back together and
made one of the nicest rock and
roll albums I’ve heard in years.
It’s a sound that, upon listening,
will cause one to remark,
‘Wow, nobody does stuff like
this anymore!”’ But of course
you,li be wrong; almost nobody

does this kind of stuff anymore.

The album’s arrangements
are tight, Eric Burdon’s vocals
are superb, and Allan Price and
the rest of the band are right on
the money. If you like rock and
roll, check out the Animals:
Before We Were So Rudely In-
terrupted. Far and away the
best re-union LP I’ve ever
heard.

Which brings us to Allan
Price. In addition to being an
ex-, now reclaimed, Animal;
singer, songwriter, pianist
Price has had a fairly suc-
cessful solo career, the high
point of which was the sound-
track LP for the Lindsay Ander-

son film ‘‘O Lucky Man.” If you
haven’t seen this, find it
somewhere and see it. Then buy
the record. However, Price has
just released a new LP for
United Artists entitled Allan
Price.This is a collection of 11
nice songs, with good ar-
rangements, in the rock and roll
tradition, and makes a perfect
companion to the Animal’s new
release. Both LP’s highly
recommended.

This week in Mainstream,
you,ll find reviews of albums by
two relatively unknowns—one
by an undiscovered solo artist
and the other a debut release by
an oddly-named band which
contains a lot of well-known
musicians.

in Your Pit—

by Galen Trussell

Last weekend the Cockpit
featured, basically, two
bluegrass bands. The crowds
were relatively tame, possibly
due to some parental in-
fluences. Friday night’s crowd
was treated to the musical
magnificence of ‘‘Rooster and
Friends.” The band was com-
posed of four individuals play-
ing guitar, banjo, mandolin,
and stand-up bass. Their
repitoire included several old
bluegrass favorites, and an-ex-
cellent rendition of ‘Orange
Blossom Special.”’

Saturday night featured a
return performance by the one
and only “Ace Weams and the
Fat Meat Boys.” The ‘Buffalo
Creek Stompers” made a
special guest appearance,
dazzling the crowd of VMI’s
with their fabulous footwork.
Unfortunately, the crowd con-
sisted primarily of our be-
uniformed friends. As a matter
of fact, if you dropped into the
Pit around 8 Saturday night
with your parents you probably
couldn’t get a seat. They must
have opened up the gates over
youder around 7:45.

Wednesday night featured
George Fagan. Due to the Phi’s
Tuesday deadline this article
can’t describe his act. The same
thing happened to me last week
in dealing with the Buffalo Chip
Band’s_ performance, which
was, by the way, one of the best
performances I’ve seen in the
Pit.

Coming up: By deadline time
this weekend was up in the air
as far as entertainment in the
Pit goes. Dan Scott told me he
might be able to get Freddy
Goodhart and the Second Hand
Band to play in the Cockpit Fri-
day night. Hopefully the Pit will
be able to provide an alter-
native, Friday night, for those
of you not interested in the
preppie-soul-madness out at the
pavillion. Saturday is really lost
in the ozone, but their is a slim
chance the Chips might be
back.

In The Works: Last week I
reported there was a chance the
UCC might be able to procure
Dave Von Ronk for a per-
formance in the Pit. Well, Dave
is in California. Instead, Spirit-
wood, a coffee house group
which plays here last year are
almost assuredly going to play
the weekend of November 16, 17
and 18.

“Hit and Run” — Monday’s
20th-century music in Lee Chapel

by Robert Tremblay

I must be honest and admit
that I have not .been the most
vocal supporter of modern
serious music. After listening to
the Performers’ committee for
Twentieth Century Music and
their concert Continuum at Lee
Chapel Tuesday night however
I must admit that there is
“something”’ to be said for this
type of music. The committee
proved this quite effectively
with Joel Sachs, pianist, con-
ductor and co-director; Cheryl
Seltzer, pianist, co-director and

founder; Sheila Schonbrun,
soprano; Thomas Hill,
clarinetist; and Nadine Asin,

flutist, all giving superb per-
formances in a_ concert
highlighted by great variety
and interest.

We have all been stereotyped
by our past listening experience
forever expecting to hear a
melody we can hum or a theme
we can remember. As most pre-
sent experienced Tuesday, this
expectation is not always fulfill-
ed (editor’s note: regretably! ).
If it is possible for us to open up
and discard a few of these pre-
judicial chains, this music can
be enjoyed, even if you do not
hear a tune in it or cannot

2seene

distinguish a diminished fourth
from a perfect fifth.

The Bartok piece, Allegro
Barbaro, is a masterpiece and
Ms. Seltzer’s performance cap-
tured the driving, bass-
dominated force behind it. Bar-
tok’s repitition of so many
passages should make this
piece accessible, but what is
startling is the different set-
tings in which he constantly
places these passages.

Sachs’ and Seltzer’s per-
formance of the Modern
Temper, a dance for piano four
hands by Seymour Shifrin,
made great technical demands
on the soloists. The same was
ture of the Wright Duo for Flute
and Clarinet where Hill and
Asin execute in superb fashion
the intricasies of this composi-
tion.

Following these lines, let’s
look more closely at
Movements for soprano, flute,
clarinet, and piano by Jane
Wilkinson. I’m sure this piece
received the most audience at-
tention as they thought it
hysterically funny. I could not
restrain chuckles myself. The
audience may not have liked
Movements, but they certainly
were, not bored with it. It kept

Soe 28) 6.43: ¢8 6 38 6S 8

attention as you waited for
Schonbrun to do something
even more unexpected than
before (editor’s note: actually,
when she climbed into the piano
to bellow, I figured I’d heard it
all...). Very little of the Twen-
tieth Century music repertoire
can be “expected” as you ex-
pect a Mozart melody. This
aspect of continually fresh, new
sounds was conveyed convinc-
ingly by the Performers’ Com-
mittee’s interpretation of Wilin-
son’s composition.

You may not have liked all
this music, but this music made
an impression. If it had not you
would not have laughted, you
would not have had opinions,
you would not have shown in-
terest. Credit for these impres-
sions goes a great deal to the
Performers’ Committee, who
were spectacular in conveying
the possbilities and variety of
Twentieth Century music in
their concert Continuum. I still
prefer Beethoven but more per-
formances like this one might
make me, and possibly many
others, appreciate just a little
more the music of our own
lifetimes.

Musical Mainstream

one to describe. Musically, it
sounds very much like
something Alan Parsons might
have done, right down to the use
of a voice vocoder (a favorite
Parsons production trick) on a
track or two. Thematically, the
LP often resembles, more than
anything else, a futuristic ver-
sion of the Beatles’ “Sergeant
Pepper’? album—the _In-
tergalactic Touring Band goes
around the universe playing
their music and keeping the
cosmos happy.

The result of all this would
seem, at first glance, to be a
very confusing record indeed.
With musicians as good as those
found on this LP, however, In-
tergalactic Touring Band could
hardly miss. Featured are Rod
Argent (of the group Argent),
Dave Cousins (the Strawbs),
Annie Haslam (Renaissance),
and even Pepe Marchello of the
Long Island-based Good Rats,
to name just a few. The in-

strumental work on the album
(particularly the orchestral ar-
rangements) is very good, and
the vocals, with some of the best
singers in the business, are ex-
cellent. The lyrics, unfortunate-
ly, range from mediocre to
downright silly — the ‘‘space”’
theme wears a little thin after a
while. If you can listen to the
album and ignore the words,
though, you’ll probably enjoyIn-

Record Season

For W&L Harriers

by Clem Carter

With 10 wins Washington and
Lee’s Cross Country team mat-
ched a school record for most
wins in one season. This ties the
record set in 1914. Washington
and Lee’s Cross Country team
finished its regular season in a
quadanglar meet against
Madison, Eastern Mennonite
College and Handen-Sydney
College in Lexington last Satur-
day. The Generals placed third
raising their record to ten wins
and five loses.

Eastern Mennonite won. the
meet with 26 points. Madison
was second with 31 points.
Washington and Lee was third
with 70 points followed by
Hamden-Sydney with 115
points.

On a fast track Richard
Ferguson of Madison set a new
course record of 25 minutes and
five seconds to capture first
place overall. The top
Washington and Lee runner was
Allen Weeks who finished ninth

place overall. His time was 27
minutes and 12 seconds. Bob
Bates ran the course in 27
minutes and 27 seconds to place
second for the Generals,
finishing 12th overall. Richard
Bird came in two seconds after
Bates taking 13th place. Chris
Daniels, who placed 16th
overall, was the fourth General
with a time of 27 minutes and 49
seconds. Hans Furuland round-
ed out the General top five with
a 20th place finish. Furuland’s
time was 28 minutes 59 seconds’
Kevin Grimm and Bill Welch
finished sixth and seventh for
the Generals respectively.
Grimm and Welch placed 21st
and 23rd overall. Brian Adams,
one of Washington and Lee’s top
seven men, was forced to drop
out of the race because of an
ankle sprain.

Despite the score the
Generals ran their best meet of
the year. All of the Generals,
top seven men improved their

Generals Sting Wasps
On Parent’s Weekend

by Pete Abitante

What team in the Old Domi-
nion State has won two straight,
run up a total offense last week
of over 550 yards, and had a run-
ningback break a single game
rushing record that stood for 25
years? The Generals, that’s
who!

Paced by an offense which led
eight major game statistical
categories and a defense that
allowed a stingy 51 yards
rushing, the Generals _per-
formance was dominating to
say the least as they took the
sting out of the Wasps of
Bridgewater College 33-13,
before an enthusiastic Parents’
Weekend crowd.

Stewart Atkinson led the
charge as he had the kind of day
runningbacks dream _ about.
With 215 yards on 26 carries,
Atkinson not only notched his
second consecutive 100 yard
plus performance, but eclipsed
the W&L single game rushing
record that stood seemingly
forgotten since 1952. Randy
Broyles ran for 205 yards on Oc-
tober 4, 1952 in a 33-28 loss to
George Washington.

Atkinson iced the game away
for the Generals as he scored
three touchdowns within the
first 18 minutes of the first
quarter. With barely three
minutes gone in the first period
Stu took a hand-off from Ted
Hissey and galloped 82 yards on
a beautiful run, which inciden-
tally was the second longest run

Soccer Team Fac.

by Eddie Fishin

If there is a Divine Being,
may he take an interest in W&L
soccer. If the Generals do not
receive divine help, they better
get their rears in gear, or pull
themselves up from their boot
straps, or get their heads
together, or whatever they need
to do to beat better teams.
Perhaps the level of competi-
tion is too far over the heads of
members of a class III school,
but I don,t think so.

The coaching is excellent and
the skills of the players are
good. What might be lacking is
the motivation of the players.
But collegiate athletes are sup-
pose to have an abundant desire
to win. What might help the soc-
cer team is a larger audience.
Knowing that more than two
dozen fans take an interest in
the team will help them. So,
what is demanded from all of
those who read this paper is
more attendance at the games.
Everyone buy a W&L pennant
and watch the very important
playoff game against UVa on
Monday at 3 p.m.

The team can play against its
opponents. For stretches during
a game the Generals will
outplay the other team. What
they have to be able to do is play
their best consistently and
throughout an entire game.

The team has lost three
games in the past week, exten-
ding its losing streak to seven
games in a row. The recent

loses have been to the Naval
Academy, UVa, and Madison
University. The midshipmen
sunk the Generals 4-1, them
damn Wahoos beat W&L 4 to
zip, and Mad U beat the
Generals 3-1.

In the Navy game, played in
mud and rain on the 26th of Oc-
tober, the Generals put out until
the third goal by Navy. Then
they gave up and Navy scored a
fourth.

The game was 1 to 1 at the
half, in what looked like a game
the Generals might pull out.
They were working well con-
trolling their attack against
Navy and benefiting from lucky
breaks on defense. Kevin
Carney, who played goal, was
doing a fine job. On one shot
when Carney was a few feet out
from the net, the ball was com-
ing down and it looked like it
would pass over Carney’s head
and bounce in. Carney,
however, was able to jump and
catch the ball. But he started to
fall on his back and lost the ball.
Before any harm could come
Carney knocked the ball away
from the net.

The first goal by Navy came
from a cross on the left side.
Carney at the corner of the net
jumped over a Navy player and
punched the ball down. But he
knocked it in the wrong direc-
tion. The ball landed in front of
the net where a Navy player
crashed in to pump it home.

Howie Collier scored on a

penalty kick for the Generals.
Collier received a pass at mid-
field from Dana Samuelson.
Collier spectacularly dribbled
by three men and reached the
penalty area, where he was
tripped. This set up the penalty
kick.

In the second half Navy
scored three times. The first
goal was scored during a scuffle
in front of the net. The ball
bounced from one player to

(continued on page 12)

in W&L history (the record be-
ing an 85 yarder by Doug Mar-
tin in 1960), for the lead that
would never be relinquished.
But Atkinson was not off and
running without the offensive
line help of Duncan, Smith,
Berry, Kniffin and Nerz who ex-
hibited great explosion off the
ball thus opening ‘‘Mack truck”’
holes for all W&L_ runn-
ingbacks. In addition, fullback
Marty Piccoli was more than an
adequate complement to Atkin-

“ar

son, gaining 25 yards on his
own, but more importantly it
was his punishing blocking
which set Atkinson gallavanting
through the Bridgewater secon-
dary. To put another feather in
his cap, Piccoli plunged in from
one yard out on the Generals
first possession of the second
half to make the score 27-7
W&L.

All the while, quarterback

Wingate passed 18 yards to tight
end Ken Rohle for a touchdown
as the teams headed to the
locker room.

. Wingate accounted for the
Wasps’ second and last score of
the day in the closing moments
of the third quarter as he hit
flanker Art Andrey with
another touchdown pass. But by
that time the outcome had long
been decided.

Overall, the Generals looked
outstanding. The offense ran off
a season high 87 plays and if the
ground game is any indication
of who controls a football game,
the Generals had 59 rushing
plays compared to just 27 for
the Wasps. Also impressive in
this contest was the play of se-
cond stringers, especially
freshmen Jim Herbert and Carl
Bates. The defense, on the other
hand exhibited a swarming pur-
suit style which was very effec-

tive.

As the Generals prepare for
this weeks contest against
Emory and Herny, they have to
be confident and maybe even a
little bit cocky. But above all,
they will have to be prepared
for an E&H team that is better
than their 1-7 record indicates.
They rank highly in all ODAC
Statistics and are second in total
offense, first in passing, and se-
cond in total defense. They are
coming off a 38-20 loss to
Hampden-Sydney but with a
win the Generals can end their
conference season at 2-2. So
let’s hope for three in a row!

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Funds mismanaged, misused

It seems as if the people who head and serve on the
various committees and organizations around cam-
pus have no conception of what it means to use and
have access to other people’s money. The SAB, and
now Contact, have shown a gross disregard for the
procedure and policy laid down by the E.C. concern-
ing the use of student funds.

According to Jack Bovay, E.C. ad hoc member to
the SAB, the SAB has failed to keep track of its money
receipts and expenditures according to guidelines
laid down by the EC. after the Hulfish controversy at
the beginning of the year. This is not to say that the
SAB is misusing student funds, but it does lead to the
question: Are the funds being abused?

Contact’s case is another story altogether. Here it
seems a definite misuse of student money has taken
place, along with a little deceit. No organization
should throw.a party for its members, using student
-money, unless approved by the E.C. beforehand. Con-
tact had a party last year for its members with the
Bruce Jenners. Not only was this party unauthorized
by the E.C., but the cost of the party was in excess of
$100.

Contact had $500 remaining from last year. This
money should have been turned over to the E.C. and
deposited in the student reserve fund. The members
of Contact instead chose to hold the money over for
this year without telling the E.C. of their plans. When
presenting their budget request this year, Contact

again failed to inform the E.C. of these excess funds,

and even went so far as to request and plead for more
student money since the E.C. gave them less money
than requested. As a result of their pleadings, $450
was taken from Ariel, the student literary magazine,
and given to Contact. It now seems that this little
deceit by Contact may jeopardize Parker Potter’s
chances of putting out a second quality edition.

These types of actions must be brought to a halt. It
is time that students are made aware that they are
answerable to an authority on campus for deceitful
and dishonorable actions. The E.C. should either
recommend to Student Control that the offending
students should be fined, or go in and clean house and
appoint new committees. This, of course, is con-
tingent upon proven guilt. If it is proven that gross of-
fenses have been made against the student body, the
E.C. must do something drastic to stop these misuses
of funds. Unless they do, “‘honor’’ may well become a
term inapplicable to this campus community.

j.m.g.
Town-Gown Proposal

Conflicts arise when two diverse groups do not have
the proper forum in which to air their grievances. At
best, rumors will be the outgrowth of such noncom-
munication; at worst, resentment and hostility will
result. The rumor is already widespread among the
students of this university that the Lexington police
are ‘‘out to get the students.”

Some sort of regular meeting must be initiated
quickly to air the differences in viewpoint between the
townspeople and the students, and to explain city
policy. Such a meeting would greatly aid in heading
off an escalation of adverse sentiment and possibly
confrontation. The city is accountable for its policy,
but the students must be given the chance to voice
their feelings directly to city administrators. The
mayor and city manager have already privately ex-
pressed their approval of such a conference. But it is
up to the students to initiate such a proposal. The
Ring-tum Phi hopes that concerned members of the
student body will act upon this proposal for a city-
student forum, and, in doing so, turn around the
already troubled town-gown relationship.

The Nose Always Knows!

Dear Sir:

I wish to clear my name from
the category of obnoxious prep
which one of your innominate
reporters seemed to think ap-
propriate. The Nose Knows not,
I’m afraid. Though his ap-
proach is original and adds a
personal flair to the paper, it is
insensate in making the Phi a
dependable, first-class publica-
tion. Also, its untimely ap-
pearance before Parents’
Weekend falls about as short of
my expectations of a quality
paper as the cartoon picturing a
student bonging. Obviously the
Nose does not cultivate a very
astute social awareness.

Firstly, I am no longer an ac-
tive X member. Secondly, I own
not one pair of bright pants,
pink or otherwise. Admittedly, I
have a green sweater, but wear
it with strict attention to color
coordination. My preference in

clothes reflects rather classic _

cuts and colors—whites, greys,
blues and yes, that green
sweater.

Thirdly, I am from a conser-
vative northern town which
seems to deny the classification
mentioned in a previous Phi ar-
ticle. By now, I’m sure you're
placing me in the pseudo-prep
category. Wrong. again!
Because I’m from the north and
attended a public school does
not deny my taste in dress. I
have always dressed in the
timeless tradition of sweaters,
khakis, tweeds, button-downs,
need I continue?

Thank you for your time, and
best of luck repairing the
deviated septum.

Dear Editor-in-Chief of the
RtP:
and To the Nose:

We will oblige your incessant
attention to our most humble
fraternity and afford you an ap-
propriate response.

Thank you so much for your |

wonderful constructive
criticism over the past few
weeks. In response we have
purchased double-knit leisure-
wear, color-coordinated with
the colors of -the fraternity,
asbestos suits for all of our
pledges, sent the Charleston
brothers up north where they
belong, required Mr. Alabama
and Mr. Arkansas to go to
reform school, appointed Lee of
A.D. as ‘‘king’’ of our house,
and initiated 17 yankees into the
bonds of our illustrious fraterni-
ty.

We realize that you are
perfect, and therefore have
divine vision with which to
judge the characters of
everyone on campus. We also
concede our despicable
behavior in all aspects of social
and campus life. But, oh mighty
Nose, we repent. Please forgive
us our trespasses. We entreat
your guidance for the re-
mainder of the year that we
may not err from the path of
righteousness which you first
troud. We will continue eagerly
to await your weekly lofty in-

 

spiration.
Just remember, everything’s
in fun, you goose!
SAE

Dear W&L community :

detrimental friction’? between
the two groups. “The majority
of students and permanent
residents of the town are not an-
tagonistic toward each other,”
he said.

The Problem of Excessive

Fraternity Noise

In extensive conversations
with both men, a picture began
to form of the present and pro-
jected future relations between
the students of this university
and the townspeople—a picture
very different from the one now
visualized by many W&L
students.

“Let’s face it,” Dr. Phillips.
said frankly, ‘‘the whole in-
dustry of this community is two
universities.’’ Mr. Doane also
agreed that VMI and W&L are
‘intregal parts” of the city,
both economically and socially.
He went on to say that the two
colleges ‘‘influence the
character of Lexington as a
community. The students must
realize that as members of the
community, they have to act
responsibly.

The current problems with
excessive fraternity noise ap-
parently began last spring with
what seemed to be a greater
frequency of parties. The
townspeople could accept
weekend partying, but weekday
festivities compounded the
potential problems. This year’s

shortened, intensified fraterni-
ty rush brought in 25 formal
complaints to the police depart-
ment, and numerous informal
complaints to city council
members and university ad-
ministrators.

Police responded to the com-
plaints as they had in the past:
by simply asking the fraternity
officer in charge to turn down
the music. But this year, it
seems, a request was not
enough. Mr. Doane feels that
the police department had lost
some of its credibility or
respect, because not long after
the requests for less noise were

made, the volume would in-

crease again to its previous
level. ‘“‘The warnings became
something that were laughed
off,’”’ he remarked.
Townspeople criticized the ci-
ty government for not respon-
ding to their needs by their
reluctance to enforce the noise
ordinance. To many members
of the Lexington community,
there seemed to have been a
“‘quantum jump in the volume
and the frequency of the par-
ties.” The police action taken
Homecoming Weekend to en-
force the noise ordinance on the
SPE and Fiji houses were a
response, then, to community
desires; they were an effort to
make the fraternities more
mindful of the townspeople’s

feelings.

Mayor Phillips emphasized
that the police action was not
harrassment. ‘‘Nobody is out to
get anybody. The police don’t
like to go into the fraternity
houses.” But the excessive
noise of the seemingly ‘‘daily”’
fraternity parties necessitated
action of some kind.

City manager Doane noted
that fraternity excesses seemed
to have “toned down con-
siderably” in the past two or
three weeks. The number of
complaints the police have
received in that time had ‘‘sub-
sided dramatically.’’ In fact,
Doane could not think of any
complaints, offhand. He hinted
that the continued good
behavior of the fraternities
might result in a lower priority
given to police enforcement of
the noise ordinance, if com-
munity concern over the issue
also diminished.

“The people in town aren’t
mad or resentful of the college
students,’’ Dr. Phillips
repeated. “‘We know there,s go-
ing to be noise,’ but the
students have to respect the
rights of the townspeople as
members of the same.com-
munity. “In nine years of city
government, I’ve never known
any problem that can’t or hasn’t
been solved.”

some time. His music is a direct
descendant of that played by
the troubadors of days gone
by—stories put to music. Says
de Burgh: “A song must be
good enough so that you can
play it on stage with a single in-
strument, like the minstrels of
old.”

At the End of a Perfect DAy,
Chris de Burgh’s third release
to date, contains ten simple,
moving songs of the sort one has
come to expect of the singer.
The upbeat numbers work best
here, particularly “Summer
Rain,”’ but most of the quieter,
more emotional songs are ex-
cellent as well. “If You Love
Her, Let Her Go” and ‘Perfect
Day” are exceptional, and rank
as two of the best songs Chris de
Burgh has done to date. Melody

Maker has called de Burgh ‘“‘the
most talented undiscovered solo
artists in Britain,” and it’s easy
to see why. With more music of
this high caliber, Chris de
Burgh won’t remain un-
discovered much longer.

Closing Notes: Pete Town-
send is currently writing
material for a new Who
album...A new Genesis album,
entitledSeconds Out, is due for
release any day now. The LP is
a double live set recorded in
Paris in 1976 and 1977. Mean-
while, Steve Hackett has left the
band in what he calls an
“amicable” split. Genesis will
apparently continue as a three
piece band...Emerson Lake &
Palmer’s latest,Works Volume
2, should also be in the stores
soon. The'single LP contains no
less than 12 tracks — seven new

group and solo pieces, and five
previously released single sides
until now unavailable on an
album...And speaking of ELP,
WLUR-FM will present ‘90
Minutes with Emerson Lake &
Palmer’’ on Thursday,
November 10, at 10:30 p.m. The
show will feature an interview
with the members of the band
and, of course, lots of their
music...Jackson Browne, too,
has an album coming out short-
ly, a live set called Running on
Empty.....And finally, the
Beach Boys seem to be holding
together after their near-
breakup, reported in the last
column. Car] Wilson insists that
“everything’s fine.”

Infirmary always
open

by Mark Danos

It is not uncommon to travel
to the infirmary and find there
is no doctor present even though
the infirmary is open 24 hours a
day. ;

There are three doctors serv-
ing the student body. They are
doctors Frederick A. Fed-
deman, James R. Busch and
Richard P. Kenney. Dr. Fed-
deman is in the infirmary from

- 9 a.m.-11 a.m. each weekday

while doctors Busch and Ken-
ney alternate days from 4 p.m. -
5:30 p.m. On weekends the doc-
tors’ hours fluctuate.
Therefore, in order to find out
when the doctor will be in you
must call at 9 in the morning.

There are also three sets of
registered nurses’ Each nurse
serves an eight hour shift. June
Agnor from 8 a.m. - 4 p.m.,
Clara Hopkins from midnight - 4
p.m. and Joe McCown from
midnight - 8 a.m. Each nurse
works five days a week. To fill
the gaps there are three relief
nurses: Carol Calkins, Linda
Carter and Edna Ewald.

The infirmary offers all the
basic stock medications —
aspirin, cold medications, anti-
biotics, muscle relaxers and so
forth. All other medications are
given by prescription.

They are able to perform sim-
ple lab tests, give stitches, do
all sports physicals and do some
scholarship physicals. Allergy
injections are given from 7 p.m.
- 10 p.m. weeknights.

measles. However, the nurse
cannot force any student to re-

Coach Miller said that the
Generals ‘‘just got beat by two
better teams.”’

Washington and Lee travels
to Roanoke College Saturday to
compete in the ODAC cham-
pionship meet. Coach Miller
predicted an easy win by
Eastern Mennonite. According
to Miller the second, third, and
fourth places will be decided
between the Generals, Lyn-
chburg and Bridgewater.
Roanoke College, Emory and
Henry and Hamden-Sydney

Miller stated that should the

Howell fights taxes, monopolies

by Carlos Peniche

Many hate him, many love
him, few are in between. He has
taken stands on issues that have
long rattled the heirarchy of the
Byrd Machine at a time when
you had to “‘go along to get
along’’ and breathe the
‘chloroform of conformity”’ in
order to make it in Virginia
politics. Consumer advocate, a
lead2r in human rights,
populist...the man _ being
described here is Democratic
candidate for governor, Henry
Evans Howell Jr.

Henry, as he prefers to be ad-
dressed has always been steps
ahead of the mainstream of
Virginia politicians. Things
most of us readily accept as
right today, Henry fought for
years ago. Howell was a leader
against the poll tax and fought
those forces who would rather
see kids, both black and white,
out of school rather than have
them share the same school.
His critics say he is  un-
sophisticated and yet it was
Henry who appeared before the
US and Virginia Supreme
Courts winning cases that
brought Virginia the concept of
‘‘one man one vote.”

Perhaps more than anything
else, Henry is known for his op-
position to excessive rates by
Virginia’s monopolistic
utilities. Commenting on VEP-
CO’s repeated rate-hikes,
Howell said “George Mason
wrote about taxation without
representation. Now it’s elec-
trification without justification.
Great Britain was almost as
powerful then as VEPCO is to-
day.”’ Here on W&L’s campus
is an economics professor who

will maintain that Henry who is
excessive and that he simply
doesn’t have the facts. Such
critics need to remember that it
is not Henry who makes the
final rate hike decisions but
rather the SCC and, in some
cases, the courts, who hear both
the Howell presentation and
that of the utility. Virginia con-
sumers saved over $140 million
when VEPCO, C&P and the
auto insurance industry at-
tempted to impose unjust rate
hikes on Virginians and Henry
went to court to stop them. Cur-
rently, the Norfolk Democrat is
working to end the automatic
fuel adjustment clause which
has been declared illegal in
neighboring North Carolina.

A major thurst of the Howell
campaign is to bring back more
home rule to Virginia localities.
This will increase the ability of
a Virginia citizen to take part in
events that affect his area
without imposing on _ other
localities. As an example, if the
people of Fairfax and Arlington
desire collective bargaining for
their city and county
employees, they can vote to
have this without forcing Lyn-
chburg, Lexington, or any other
area to have it. Howell will also
bring government and people
closer together with the
establishment of Citizens Ad-
visory Committees in direct
communication to the Gover-
nor’s office. This can be done
cheaply because through his wit
and dynamism he has attracted
a large number of dedicated
supporters who believe in his
ideals and would gladly serve
on such committees at little cost

to the taxpayer. One can only
appreciate this unique
phenomenon by working with
and seeing ‘‘Henry’s people’’ in
action.

It is clear to the anti-Howell
forces that a campaign based
on a fair and rational examina-
tion of the issues and the can-
didates’ records would result in
a Howell victory. Thus, huge
sums of anti-Howell money
have been accumulated to send
out distortions about Howell
through mass-mailings of let-
ters and literature. The In-
dependent Virginians for
Responsible Government at-
tempted to air anti-Howell ads
on TV, admitting that the ads
contained distortions, possible
falsehoods and _ statements
taken out of contest. No TV sta-
tion in Virginia would allow
such tactics on their channels.
The anti-Howell candidate
denies Virginians the opportuni-
ty to compare both candidates
through an open and face to
face debate.

*

The choice of this election is
clear. It is between ‘‘business
as usual,’’ by allowing the can-
didate of the bankers, insurance
companies and utilities to
govern Virginia in the same
stagnant fashion we have had
for years, on the one hand, and
government for and by the peo-
ple on the other. Regardless of
what people may think of the
man personally, few would
disagree with the view that
Henry Howell gets things done.
Now is the time Virginia can
finally move in to the twentieth
century.

WLUR will broadcast returns

by Jim Parker

It is Tuesday night. The 7th
day in November is coming toa
close. You have just spent a
hard night booking for an exam
the next day. You go out and
catch a buzz with some friends.
You return to your house and
decide to relax and listen to
WLUR and Third Ear. But wait,
instead of music flowing from
your stereo, it is the sound of a
broadcaster reporting that the
gubernatorial race in Virginia
has yet to be decided. You think
to yourself, ‘I must be really
messed up.’’ No, our fictitious
person is not messed up at all,
at least concerning what he
hears. For on next Tuesday,
Election Day, WLUR will begin
election coverage at 7:00 p.m.
and continues non-stop until all
the races have been decided.

A newsteam has been
organized by the WLUR staff to
report the election news. An-
choring the newsteam will be
WLUR news director Ed

Burgess and his assistant, Steve
Mattesky. There will also be a
number of WLUR staffmen who
will phone in election returns
and do general analytical work
Tuesday night. These returns
will not be as numerous as, say,
last year, which was a presiden-
tial and congressional year.
Nevertheless, there will be a
number of races covered. The
principal battle will come in
deciding the new governor.
Democrat Henry Howell and
Republican John Dalton will be
vying to obtain the post, former-
ly held by Republican Mills
Godwin. Other races include the
contests for state lieutenant
governor and attorney general
and the local struggle for the 9th
district House Delegate posi-
tion. Also being reported will be
the vote on a bond that will pro-
vide taxes for a flood project in
Buena Vista.

WLUR will concern itself with
election news from 7:00 p.m.
until the races are decided, but

the WLUR newsteam will not be
reporting all night long.
Burgess said that for the first 15
minutes of every half hour,
WLUR will switch its coverage
to the Virginia Public Radio
Election Network, of which
WLUR is a part. The VPREN
will broadcast late returns plus
reports from reporters on state
races, and will also analyze
results and indicate trends. The
15 minute segments apportion-
ed to the WLUR newsteam will
be using the same format, in
general, as that of VPREN, but
using local news instead of
statewide returns, said
Burgess. Reporters will phone
in election results which will
then be taped and aired at the
appropriate time. There will
also be some analysis of the
Tuesday vote. Burgess said that
some of the local winning or los-
ing candidates may be inter-
viewed on the station. Also,
reporters in the field will be

Dalton pushes

public jobs

by Steve Yeakel

The election of John Dalton
will go a long way in preserving
the qualities of responsive, effi-
cient government vital to
Virginia’s future. He will win
because Virginians have found
his views more in line with their
own, and because he has reduc-
ed the demagoguery of his oppo-
nent to rhetorical rambling.

John Dalton’s record as a

legislator has been as con--

sistently beneficial to Virgi-
nians as any politician’s in state
history. His perception of the
issues this year is no exception.
The major priority in a Dalton
Administration is Jobs for
Virginians — a job for every
Virginian who will work. John
Dalton assisted in providing the
economic climate that created
50,000 new jobs this past year.
He knows that, in order to con-
tinue this trend, we must stress
marketable skills in our educa-
tional process, encourage
business interests, keep taxes
from biting off too much of each
citizen’s paycheck, and expand
our energy supplies.
Concerning Virginia’s energy
policies, John Dalton has
already commissioned a task
force which has prepared a
comprehensive’ study of
Virginia’s energy problem and
proposed practical conserva-
tion solutions. He advocates full

development of our oil
resources on the outer continen-
tal shelf and better use of our
massive coal reserves. These
policies will help us avoid crises
of last winter’s proportions.
Open government is also a ~
key portion of a Dalton Ad-
ministration. As Lieutenant
Governor, John Dalton held
over 100 open-door meetings
around the state to help solve
head-on the problems of in-
dividuals with their govern-
ment. He will continue these
open-door meetings, and has
further proposed a monthly
People’s Day at the Capitol,
during which he will tak with in-
dividuals about their ideas and
problems. He is committed to
the partnership with people that
results in good government.
John Dalton has met these
and countless other issues
directly, and he presents prac-
tical solutions for tough pro-
blems. He has also been able to
cope with the barrage of un-
founded rumors and vicious
allegations so typical of his op-
ponent’s campaign style. As a
result, the Dalton ranks are
swelling with disoriented

Democrats who refuse to be

loyal to a candidate who has not
returned their loyalty in the
past. For all these reasons,
Virginia’s next great governor
is John Dalton.

by Robert Tremblay

Year in and year out I’m
amazed at the high quality of
singing displayed by the W&L
Glee Club. The reason for such
amazement is not due so much
to the difficulty factor involved,
though this singing certainly
isn’t easy, but that so few
members of the Glee Club are
actually musically trained.
Many of them can’t tell a C.
from an F major, but still they
can sing a technically deman-
ding piece like the Brahms’
RHAPSODIE beautifully. How
is this possible? Well, I would
like to say that the credit goes to
both parties, the singers and the
director, Gordon Spice. Both
share the honor but, in this
situation, I’m afraid that a few
extra kudis must go to Pro-
fessor Spice.

His handling of the Glee Club
last Friday night at Lee Chapel
during Parents’ Weekend was
truly masterful. Being able to
listen in on the rehearsals for
this concert, I can now see why
the Glee Club is so polished and
prepared. Professor Spice
treats these students like pro-
fessionals in that he wants
everything sung correctly, from
the smallest accent to the most
obvious crescendo. You would

expect such treatment of
singers if you were dealing with
students with musical
backgrounds. But this, in most
instances, is not the case.
Here’s where the Glee Club’s
hard work and talent really
pays off. These people are ob-
viously good and it is Professor
Spice who has molded them into
a superb singing unit. .

For example, for the first
selection on their program, the
Glee Club sang Grieg’s
Brother’s, Sing On. It was sung
marvelously, but what was tru-
ly impressive was that the
singers had no music in front of
them. The piece was memoriz-
ed, and though this is ! not easy
to do to begin with, when few
people in the Glee Club could
have told you the first pitch of
the piece, the accomplishment
is even more outstanding.

The Schubert Songs, though
they might seem easy, are pret-
ty tricky pieces, but again, the
Glee Club was up to the task. I
loved all of these, but I liked
everything on the program
anyway. Who wants to get
technical when the music is as
beautiful as it was.

The Brahms’ Rhapsodie was
the most difficult piece on the
program, but the singers and

ee Cla "Pralead

accompanist, Jay Taggart, who
was superb throughout, again
were magnificent. Mary Jane
Cooper, the contralto, was
equally as fine in a part that re-
quired such cut leaps as an oc-
tave and a fifth, certainly not
easy, and her tone throughout
was Clear and precise.

All in all, this concert was
nothing less than spectacular,
and though I was not able to
hear the newly-formed W&L
brass ensemble, they certainly
deserve mention also for they
began the proceedings.

The concert was concluded
with College Friendships and it
was a fitting conclusion to a
concert in which both the pro-
gram and the singing were so
obviously excellent, a perfect
combination, a combination I

look forward to in the next Glee ~

Club concert.

Fines...

Fines were levied against KA,
Lambda Chi and The Phi Kaps
by the IFC Tuesday night.

Kappa Alpha was put on a
week’s social probation beginn-
ing November 6-13 for conduct
unbecoming gentlemen at one
of the area women’s colleges.
The KA pledges were caught
digging up a hitching post at
Sweet Briar, resulting in a let-
ter of complaint being sent to
the W&L administration from
the Sweet Briar administration,
according to IFC secretary
Steve Jones.

Kappa Alpha, Phi Kappa
Sigma, and Lambda Chi Alpha
were fined $50, $50, and $100
respectively for kidnapping
freshmen from the freshmen
dorm area. Lambda Chi was
fined for two offenses.

The IFC regulation regarding
kidnapping states no fraternity
related activity is to take place
in the freshmen dorms of the
dorm area.

% pledged

63.5% of the freshmen class.
have pledged a fraternity ac-
cording to statistics released by
the IFC Tuesday. 227 of 357
freshmen chose to go the frater-
nity route, and 22 second year
men entered brotherhood as
well.

IFC secretary, Steve Jones,

‘said these figures were in keep-

ing with past trends. He also
said this reflects the ratio of
non-frat to frat for the whole

student body.

Stipulation that the lack of
adherence to the guidelines
would be considered sufficient
grounds for an honor violation
hearing. However, one EC
member said he thought, at the
time the motion passed
unanimously, this part was ex-
traneous to the main thrust of
the motion.

The same member said he
thought lack of adherence to the
guidelines would be grounds for
reconsidering the appointments
of Hulfish, Tucker and
Foreman. He said the three
may be “‘relieved of their jobs”
if it can be shown they did not
follow the guidelines.

Hulfish and Tucker were
unavailable for comment, but
Foreman said the SAB has been
following the accounting
guidelines. He said all the
receipts are placed neatly in lit-
tle files. On the question of night

deposit bags, Foreman said he
and Hulfish went to a local bank
to try to obtain them, but bank
officials were ‘‘skeptical’’ about
giving them to students. The
SAB reported this predicament
to the EC, Foreman said, and
vice president George Griffin
promised to look into it. He
never did, according to
Foreman. The SAB then sug-
gested getting a safe for its of-
fice, Foreman said. Again Grif-
fin promosed to look into it but
didn’t come through, Foreman
said.

Griffin responded that he had
in fact contacted Hulfish after
making an investigation of the
night deposit bag situation.
Griffin said that he directed
Hulfish to go to First National
Exchange Bank, where the
university has its accounts.
FNEB will give the SAB night
deposit bags’ Griffin said.
Previously Hulfish and
Foreman looked in to getting
the deposit bags from United
Virginia Bank, where the
university has no accounts, said
Griffin. Griffin said he made it
clear to Hulfish that he would
only look into buying a safe if
the SAB could not acquire night
deposit bags.

Another important issue the
EC discussed was
undergraduate use of the law
library. Undergraduate EC
members seemed to think that a

referendum conducted at the
law school on Friday asking
what should be done about pro-
blems undergrads cause in the
law library was superfluous
because law students can’t dic-
tate school policy. Goddard,
however, said the feeling
among law students is that ‘we
own the law school.’’ He said
Dean John had been ‘more
than willing to go along with
Student Bar Association
policy.”’ And he said he saw no
reason why John wouldn’t go
along with whatever is decided
by the referendum. He said two

of the referenda will have a run
off later this week. One referen-

dum would force
undergraduates. to register
before they could use the

library. The other referendum
requires that no obnoxious
behavior take place in the
library.

Goddard said some persons
“‘are really nuts’’ about
undergrads using the law
library. Doug Perkins, senior
EC representative, replied that
lots of undergrads ‘‘can:t stand
law students either, but we
don’t keep you from using our

facilities.”’

Other complaints by Goddard
were that undergrads won’t
move from law students’ car-
rels, trash the television room,
take over the main reading
room, are “not sensitive to the
need for quiet in the law school”
and, at one point, held a pizza
party in the faculty lounge.

E. C. Leaves Parties
Up to Chairmen

by Lee Howard

A proposal which would have
made it an honor violation to
have a party with student funds
without obtaining authorization
from the Executive Committee
was voted down 8-1 Monday
night.

The proposal, submitted by
Rick Goddard, came after the
Ring-tum Phi disclosed the past
week that Contact had a $115
dinner on April 19 at the College
Inn which included 10 to 12 Con-
tact members and some dates.

Goddard called the dinner a
‘‘gross abuse of student
money.” He said former Con-
tact co-chairman John Bruch
and Tom Murphy used their
positions ‘‘to have nice times.”’

Bruch pointed out that Con-
tact does not derive all its funds
for the EC and, therefore, he
said, the EC cannot give Con-
tact a set of directives.

Goddard replied that if the
EC gave Contact money with
the stipulation that it would get
no money if it had a party
without EC approval Contact
would have to follow EC
guidelines.

The most effective argument
Bruch put forth against God-
dard’s proposal was that it took
away a good deal of discretion
from co-chairmen and made the
EC all-powerful. He said Con-
tact co-chairmen have been
“given a good deal of discre-
tion’’ in the past.

Goddard said “This is an
abuse of discretion.’’ Doug
Perkins said he didn’t like the
idea of the EC acting as a

“police force,’’ and was
therefore opposed to Goddard’s
motion.

Jackie Boyden, law represen-
tative, said Goddard's motion
established a ‘‘pattern ot con-
duct” for every organization to
follow, however she was not
sure lack of adherence to God-
dard’s proposal should be made
an honor violation.

Other representatives ex-
pressed the same feelings,
despite the fact that the EC
passed a motion by Goddard in
September that made lack of
adherence to accounting

IFC May Withhold
Contact Funds

by Jim Barnes and Lee Howard

When Contact co-chairman
Walter Granruth appeared
before the Inter Fraternity
Council earlier this year to
solicit funds, he told the IFC
that Contact’s only assets were
those that had been ap-
propriated for it by the EC, IFC
president Steve Mattesky and
IFC secretary Steve Jones have
told the Ring-tum Phi.

Mattesky said that, in light of
the Phi’s revelation last week
that Contact actually had
almost $500 left from the
previous year, there is some
sentiment among the IFC
membership to take away a
portion of the IFC money that
has been earmarked for Con-
tact this year.

Mattesky said he “‘personally
disapproves”’ of Contact parties
and dinners being held without
the IFC, Executive Committee
or parents being informed of
them. He added, ‘‘I think that’s

the feeling of a lot of fraternities
on campus.”

Mattesky said he ‘‘would like
to see stipulations put on the
money that Contact receives
from the IFC.”’ He and Jones
concurred in saying that IFC
money should go strictly for
speakers’ fees.

When questioned as to whom
Contact should be accountable,
Mattesky said he was leery of
giving the power of oversight
solely to the EC. He said, “I
don’t want the EC determining
how the money IFC gives to
Contact is to be spent.’’ Mat-
tesky said he favors some sort
of joint committee of EC and
IFC members which would
decide to either grant or
withhold approval of Contact
parties.

Such a proposal, if put into ef-
fect, would seem to weaken
Contact members’ argument
that no one can tell Contact how
to spend its money because no
one gives Contact all its money.

Independent Exams Remain

by Galen Trussell

The W&L faculty resounding-
ly gave its approval to retain in-
dependent exams in a voice
vote at the faculty meeting held
Monday.

The faculty vote for retention
came after the Faculty EC for-
mulated its recommendation to
retain the independent exam
schedule. The Faculty EC’s
recommendation first became
public at a University Council
meeting held October 24.

The Faculty EC decided to re-
ject the proposal made last
April, “that the independent ex-
amination schedule should be
abolished and the registrar
prepare an examination

schedule for use in the fall term
1977.’’ Instead, after discussing
independent exams with the
Student EC and considering the
results of the Faculty EC’s
questionaire, the Faculty EC
voted to propose to the faculty
that the independent examina-
tion schedule be retained. The
University Council then endors-
ed the Faculty EC recommen-
dation by a vote of 21 to 1.

The questionaire circulated
by Dean Atwood’s office asked
faculty members their feelings
about independent exams. Just
under 100 of the approximately
130 faculty members returned
the questionaires. Only six
questionaires returned showed

pany, returning for their third visit — by popular d2mand — to the

the retention of independent ex-
ams. Only six faculty members
stated that they had first hand
knowledge of honor offenses,
and only 22 said they had second
hand Knowledge.

More Noise

The EC and IFC, in combina-
tion, give Contact more than 85
per cent of its budget.

Contact members’ only
recourse would be to claim that
money for dinners is provided
by the 15 per cent of the budget
parents chip in every year.
However, thre is no mention in
the letters sent home to parents
soliciting funds for Contact that
their money could be spent for
dinners or parties for Contact
members. As a matter of fact
the letters specify that Contact
seeks to ‘‘provide your son with
a truly stimulating program” of

speakers. Notes on Contact:

—Granruth said, as quoted in
last week's Ring-tum Phi, that
“the $500 which was held over
was necessary for the operation
of Contact during the summer
and in the fall term before Con-
tact received any funds from
the EC, IFC or parents.
However, in an interview with
assistant university treasurer
Louis Snyder, Snyder said
“there was no activity from
June to September’, in the Con-
tact account.

—Snyder said he was never
informed of the EC’s directive
that all unused Contact funds be
returned to the Central Student
Body Fund. He said all student
organizations’ accounts, except
Contact’s and the Mock Conven-

_ tion’s, are closed at the end of

Pi Phi Summoned

Pi Kappa Phi fraternity presi-
dent M. Gray Coleman was
given a summons for a noise or-
dinance violation on Friday
night at 11:25, Lexington Police
Chief J. A. Kirby has confirm-
ed.

Coleman said the Pi Kapp
summons was the earliest noise
ordinance summons given so
far. Previously, Sigma Phi Ep-
silon and Phi Gamma Delta
fraternities were hit with noise
violations. Pi Kapp was not
warned that its music was too
loud before the summons was
issued, Coleman said.

Coleman explained that Pi
Kapp had a live band in Friday
night and that a door close to
where the band was playing
was left open for a while to
allow cool air to reach the dance
floor. It was apparently during
this time that a neighbor called
the police to complain and that
Pi Kapp was found in violation
of the noise ordinance.

The ordinance states that
after 11 p.m. no music should be

heard more than 50 feet from
the building it emanates

Coleman said he thought tne
police department is under
pressure from someone to en-
force the noise ordinance.

“The police are torn mid-
diemen,’’ Coleman said. He
quoted the policemen who
issued the summons as saying,
“We don't want to bother you
people.’’ They said some of the
fraternity’s neighbors “have
forgotten what it’s like to be
young,’’ Coleman said.

Coleman said he was worried
about neighbors’ change in at-
titude since last year. Previous-
ly, neighbors would call the
fraternity house to ask that the
music be turned down, he said.
Despite quick response to
neighbors'requests in the past,
this year neighbors are com-
plaining directly to the police,
he said

Coleman said he thought the
person who called the police
Friday night made a ‘‘crackpot

University Council’s

role defined

by Randy Smith

The University Council is, at
least on paper, one of the most
important committees of
Washington and Lee. According
to co-chairman Dean John, the
UC has jurisdiction over ‘‘any
issue of policy in non-academic
matters’’ affecting student life.
It is “‘the highest authority”’
governing student affairs, and
sets policy for the Student Con-
trol Committee, the Interfrater-
nity Council and the Student Af-
fairs Committee.

The Student Handbook
describes the purpose of the
University Council as giving the
students ‘‘an involvement in the
University governmental pro-
cess...It serves as an official in-
termediary between students,
faculty and administration.”’ It
is, primarily, ‘“‘an advisory
group” which discusses and
debates proposals initiated by
the students and faculty, and
makes recommendations to the
administration, student govern-
ment and faculty. In its capaci-
ty as an advisory group, the UC
is supposed to provide ‘‘a forum

 

for the exchange of ideas on
critical issues facing the
University.” But recently, its
ability to uncover “critical
issues”’ for discussion has been
seriously questioned.

History

Relations between students
and faculty were turbulent at
colleges throughout the country
in the late 1960’s and early
1970’s. The situation at
Washington and Lee was also
strained, although not as much
as at other schools. A basic lack
of student input into University
policies was a cause for agita-
tion. Students were not involved
in the recuitment program, or,
indeed, in many other actions
affecting university life. In 1969,
the faculty adopted the present
12-12-6 calendar schedule
without consulting with or even
properly notifying the students.
Grievances mounted and pro-
mpted the proposal for a
“university council.”’

from the school’s administra-
tion, faculty and student body,

Traveler from Altruria

 

Have fun last weekend? I
did, I think. It was all kind of a
blur after the IFC beerfest Fri-
day night, though. I was at the
Pavillion. Had a date. And forc-
ed lots of beer down her gullet. I
did the same. After that, who
knows?

Let me try to reconstruct this
now. There I was at Zollman’s
in my best button down shirt
and corduroy pants, people dan-
cing, swimming and then pass-
ing out (depending on both their
and my state of ennebriation)
before my eyes. All of a sudden
it was my girl who “hit the
dust.” Shocked, somewhat em-
barassed, yet with that wild
look in my eyes that greets the
word ‘‘opportunity,” I carried
her through the mud and the
driving rain to my car and laid
her gently (oh, so gently) on my
crushed valure back seat.

Driving with maniacal zeal
back to my apartment before it
was too late, I ‘“‘made it’’ with
only minutes to spare. I carried
her up three flights of stairs and
down one (I was drunk too) un-
til I got to my ‘Penthouse
apartment.” After laying her on
the bed, she suddenly woke up.
In the confusion of the moment,
however, I was able to convince
her that her clothes were a sym-
bol of middle class social com-
placency. ‘I’m liberal,’’ she
shrieked as she tore off her
clothes.

Before she changed her mind

and decided it was rather gooa
to be socially complacent, I
threw her clothes out the win-
dow, explaining that I was
checking the wind direction.
This all seemed quite logical to
her until I began throwing my
clothes out the window. I ex-
plained this away, however, by
saying I was afraid her clothes
would be lonely.

The next morning I woke up
and tried to figure out who was
lying beside me. It certainly
couldn’t be the same person
with whom I went to the

to weigh at least 250 pounds. I
couldn’t have been that drunk,
or could I? I still can’t figure
out how a 125 pound weakling
myself could have carried her
up all those stairs, though. I

beerfest. The girl beside me had

ing that
“‘desperate.”’

The worst part of the whole
debacle was, however, having
to take her to the Dining Hall to
eat breakfast Saturday morn-
ing. The checker wanted to ask
Jerry Darrell, the Food Czar,
whether to charge my date for
one meal or two. JD wouldn’t
allow her to eat because the
training meal for the football
team didn’t start until 11
o'clock. Funny, very funny. But
I must admit it was very dif-
ficult explaining it was just a
simple case of mistaken identi-
ty.

the University Council was to
take over the faculty’s respon-
sibility for student and fraterni-
ty conduct. Dormitory rules and
regulations were to be
established by the UC, as well
as aiding in the planning of
freshman orientation week and
the administration of the facul-
ty advisor system. Most im-
portantly, each faculty standing
committee would pass its report
through the new council before
sending them to the faculty
itself. In this way, students
would become aware of faculty
proposals and would have a
chance for comment before the
proposals became policy.

A mechanism for student par-
ticipation had at least been set
up. Although the UC had no
jurisdiction over the Honor
System or curricular affairs, it
could initiate new proposals for
study by the administration and
make recommendations to the
faculty expressing student
desires—an important step for-
ward in the eyes of many. But in
an editorial on December 2,
1970, the Ring-tum Phi warned,
perhaps all too perceptively:
“The possibility for student ‘in-
put’ is present in the proposed
University Council. But we
wonder how many students will
become truly involved in the
future of the university by the
mere creation of a council.”

This Year

By many accounts, the first
meeting of the University Coun-
cil was a long and tedious af-
fair. After senior student
representative John Sacco was
elected co-chairman (with
Dean John), discussion
centered primarily on a pro-
posal which would rotate atten-
dance by faculty represen-
tatives. University professors
are busy men, and their atten-
dance at a monthly meeting
which seems to accomplish lit-
tle was felt, by some, to be an
unnecessary burden on their
time. Sophomore UC represen-
tative Biff Martin, remarked:
“Judging from the format and
topics of discussion of the first
meeting, I can see why pro-
fessors would want to rotate
their responsibility to attend UC
meetings.”

Last Week

This year’s second meeting
was held last Thursday after-
noon. All in attendance were
given a summary of actions
taken by the Faculty Executive
Committee and the Committee
on Courses and Degrees. Atten-
dants, particularly students,
are supposed to quickly read

Nemerov returns to W&L campus for twoda ys.

Noted poet, author to

lecture next week

Howard Nemerov, one of
America’s leading men of let-
ters, will visit Washington and
Lee University for two days
next week. Nov. 14-15

A man highly praised for his
prose, poetry and criticism,
Nemerov will give a_ public
reading of some of his poetry on
Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. in Lee
Chapel.

During his two-day visit,
Nemerov will also meet with a
number of classes at
Washington and Lee, including
modern literature and
American prose classes. He will
also speak to a_ natural
philosophy class in physics
because some of his work has
dealt with scientific . terms and
discoveries.

Severn Duvall, head of
W&L’s English department,
says Nemerov is ‘‘a man of let-
ters in the European sense of
the phrase - a man for whom
letters are a way of life, not just
as a teacher or a poet, but a
creative man. He has an affini-
ty for the tradition of American
verse, like Frost. He is not a dif-
ficult poet.’’

Nemerov is the author of nine
. volumes of verse, five of fiction,
and three of essays. He has won
a number of awards and
fellowships, including a Na-
tional Institute of Arts and Let-
ters grant in 1961, a Gug-
genheim in 1969, and an
Academy of American Poets
fellowship in 1971.

His visit to Washington and
Lee coincides with the publica-

tion of his latest book, ‘“The Col-
lected Poems of Howard
Nemerov.”’ Duvall said it is
unusual for a collection of
poems to be published at this
point in a _ poet’s life, and
reflects Nemerov’s place in the
forefront of American poets.

Nemerov has taught at Benn-
ington, Hamilton, Brandeis and
Minnesota and is currently on
the faculty of Washington
University in St. Louis. In
1963-64 he was the Library of
Congress consultant on poetry.

He has been a frequent visitor
to Washington and Lee, beginn-
ing with the first visit in 1962.
His visits here have been spon-
sored by a number of visiting-
scholar programs including the
Phi Beta Kappa Visiting
Scholar program in 1975.
Nemerov received an honorary
degree from W&L in 1976. .

His visit is sponsored by the
Arthur Graham and Margaret
Glasgow Endowment,
established at W&L in 1960 ‘‘to
promote the art of expression
by pen and tongue.”’

Army chorus to perform Nov. 16

The famed United States Ar-
my Chorus and the United
States Army Brass Quintet will
give a free concert next
Wednesday (Nov. 16) under the
sponsorship of the Rockbridge
Concert-Theatre Series.

The performance will be at
8:15 p.m. in the VMI’s Jackson
Memorial Hall. The public in
Rockbridge County and beyond
is invited to attend at no charge,
whether members of the Con-
cert Series or not, RCTS presi-
dent Leonard E. Jarrard said.

“This is another gift to
residents of the area by this fine
male chorus and by RCTS,”
Jarrard said. ““The Chorus per-
formed here in 1973 and 1974
under the same arrangement,
and I am sure residents will
welcome this third opportunity
to hear and see them.”

The program will consist of
five part songs by Edward
Elgar, three pieces by Francis
Poulenc, ‘“‘A Scotch Mist” ar-
ranged by Gordon Binkerd with
texts by Robert Burns on tradi-
tional Scot airs, and “The
Strong Man,” a cantata on texts
by Carl Sandburg, by M. Sgt.
Thomas Beveridge, _bass-
baritone and a member of the
Chorus.

The Army Brass Quintet, con-
sisting of trumpets, horn, trom-
bone and tuba, will play pieces
by Thomas Beveridge, George
Gershwin, and a suite by More-
ly Calyert.

The Chorus is conducted by
Maj. Allen Crowell, who studied
at Florida State University and
received his Bachelor of Music
degree from  Princeton’s
Westminister Choir College. A
bass soloist, he has appeared
often with such organizations as
Washington’s National Sym-
phony, and the orchestras of

A good time in Lex.?

 

Baltimore, Annapolis and York,
Pa.

The Chorus, established of-
ficially in 1956, has earned an
enviable reputation in the
worlds of serious and popular
music. It has performed in
every major city of the United
States, at many colleges and
universities, from Carnegie
Hall to the President’s State

Dinner for the Apollo 11
astronauts in Los Angeles.
The Chorus feels a particular

responsibility to perform the
great works written specifically

for male voices by the master
composers, but they are equally
at home with popular tunes,
show music, folk songs,
spirituals, and pieces arranged
by their own members.

The remaining programs on
the RCTS 1977-78 season are the
duo-pianists Jeffry and Ronald
Marlowe on Jan. 17 in Jackson
Memorial Hall and Gilbert and
Sullivan’s ‘‘The Pirates of Pen-
zance,”’ performed by the
Manhattan Savoyards, on
March 13 in the Lexington High
School Auditorium.

 

Promising entertainment can be found

by Heartsill Ragon

Entertainment in  Lex-
ington? Never. A couple of
weekend drunks. And, of
course, Fancy Dress. But that’s
about it.

Three years ago, W&L
students might have not believ-
ed Lexington had any ‘hot
spots’.’’ But today, area hot
spots appear to be the current
rage in a town that once might
have been considered Southern
and sleepy and boring.

Clyde Mull, manager of the
College Inn on Main Street, has
said he was one of the forerun-
ners of this current ‘‘night club
syndrome’’ Lexington seems to
be experiencing. With discos
during the week, live bands on
weekends, an occasional play or
two and a new $4,000 giant
television screen, Mull appears
to have tried most of the enter-
tainment angles—at least once.

“IT can’t seem to generate any

interest,’’ Mull laments.
“Students will not pay a cover
charge.”

Mull said he tries to coor-
dinate his social functions and
entertainment to student social
life but added these attempts
have tended to be less than pro-
fitable. He said he’s even gone
so far as to contact fraternity
social chairmen, attempting to
organize some student interest.

Last year, Mull delved into
the disco scene for a limited
time. He reported losing bet-
ween $50 and $150 each night his
deejays played dancing music
‘‘but I’m not quitting,’’ Mull ad-

       

The College Inn’s newest ad-
dition has been a giant, $4,000
television screen. ‘I’m pleased
with it but it’s not bringing peo-
ple in like I’d planned,” Mull
said.

White Column Inn

Elsewhere on Main Street, a
different form of student enter-
tainment can be found. To
many W&L students, the White
Column Inn seems to be the best
place in town for imported beer
and live music.

Paul Buskey, manager of the

WCI, said his restaurant has
been in the music and entertain-
ment business for about a year.
He said it took a good six mon-
ths before the White Column Inn
became established around
town and around campus as an
“in” place to hang out—a place
for good music and good times.
Buskey’s success in booking
bands for their weekly, Wednes-
day night jam sessions lies in
the numerous contacts he has
with area bands. He said bands
are eager to find mid-week
engagements to supplement
their busy weekend schedules

while also supplementing their
weekly income.

He added that because of Lex-.

ington’s close proximity to In-
terstate 81, the area bars can
readily obtain East Coast
talent.

‘“‘Wednesday was just a dead
night in town,’”’ Buskey said.
“Through various connections
we gathered some mountain
music.”

So far, the Wednesday night
entertainment at the White Col-
umn Inn has been reportedly
“very successful.’’ The $1.50
cover charge, page 3 which to
some students might seem
steep, actually is the only pay
the bands at the WCI are paid.
“It’s not very much because it’s
a pretty small place,”’ Buskey
said.

The Good Trencherman

David Waldeck, music coor-
dinator for the Good Trencher-
man, has recently joined the
fastly-moving entertainment
fad. Concentrating on a “well
rounded’ booking schedule,
Waldeck recently booked M.F.
Rattlesnake for the weekend
and crowded 400 people in The
Downstairs for the two night
performances.

The cover charge policy of the
Good Trencherman parallels
that of the White Column Inn:
all gate receipts go to the band.

Waldeck described the
reasoning behind the Trencher-
man’s recent switch to a ‘‘night
club”’ setting as ‘‘an alternative
to a boring weekend.”’

Debaters

receive
awards

by Neil J. Cote

Two Washington and Lee
University students won first-
place trophies in individual
speaking events and the ‘‘A”’
team from Virginia Military In-
stitute finished first in team
competition in a _ series of
debates held at the W&L cam-
pus last weekend.

Five schools: Bridgewater
College, Roanoke College,
United States Naval Academy,
VMI and W&L, competed in the
tournament. The Bridgewater
‘—. -, a. ee 6
finished second, third and
fourth while Navy took fifth
place.

In individual competition,
speakers were put in one of
three catogories: impromptu,
extemperaneous and persua-
sion. Competitors in impromptu
had to speak without rehearsal
while those in extemperaneous
were alotted a half hour to
prepare their topic and were
allowed the use of one note
card. Speakers in persuasion
were allowed to write their
speech before competition, but
were not able to use their notes.

Joseph Cox, a junior at W&L,
took first place in “persuasion”
and his teammate, Alfred
Hintz, a freshman, finished first
in ‘‘extemperaneous.’’ The best
W&L could do in “impromptu”
was junior John Leithead’s
third-place finish.

In team competition, the topic
centered on whether United
States law enforcement agen-
cies should be given significant-
ly greater freedom in the in-
vestigation and/or prosecution
of felony crime. The inex-
perienced W&L debaters beat
Bridgewater ‘‘A”’ and VMI “‘B”
and lost to Bridgewater ‘‘B’’.

Halford Ryan, assistant pro-
fessor of public speaking and
coach of the debate team, says
that this year’s team has had
some trouble in competition due
to their inexperience but should
improve with time. He said that
the rigid academic life of W&L
sometimes limits the prepara-
tion debaters need for tour-
naments. Still, he says that the
young team will be strong in the
future.

A debate against Madison
College is tentatively scheduled
for November 11-i3. On
November 18, W&L will send
students to compete in in-
dividual speaking events at a
debate at George Mason Col-
lege in Fairfax.

NOTICE

Intervarsity is planning an in-
formal get together tomorrow
night in room 114 of the student
center at 7:30 p.m. For those
unfamiliar with I-V, it is a form
of Christian fellowship here at
W&L. Surrounding girls’
schools usually participate in
the meetings. This week’s topic
is “A Time for Sharing.”
Everyone is welcome.

ENTERTAINMENT

 

In Your Pit- - -

by Galen Trussell

Last weekend the Pit featured
only one act, the Buffalo Chip
Band, which appeared Friday
night.

The Chips, composed of Lex
Birney, Ron Spain, Morgan
Simmons and newcomer Peter
Pearl, drew a relatively large
crowd, if you consider the other
activities which went down last
Friday eve. After all, the
Downstairs Bar featured M. F.
Rattlesnake, and how often
does one get a chance to see the
super spectacular stupendous
Shirelles ... YUCK!

Saturday didn’t have any
planned entertainment, but
things got cooking down in the
Pit anyway. You know our
friends next door who wear
those uncomfortable grey suits
with the high collars? Well, it
seems a couple of them imbibed
to a mild excess and were
pleasantly asked to leave by
some upperclassmen. Rumor

has it one of the excessors took
out his frustrations on some
windows.

Again, as always, I must
report that plans for this
weekend are nebulous this early
in the week. All around good
guy Burr Datz has said that he
and some friends will play for
the general student enjoyment
Friday night, but Saturday
again is at a loss. I personally
don’t see any reason to spend
W&L students’ money to pro-
vide Saturday entertainment
for the Vemies.

Coming up .s- The weekend
following this immediate one
will feature Spiritwood, made
up of Lee and Larry Lawson.
Lee and Larry describe their
style as ‘‘music to smile by.”
Their music includes the use of
a wide variety of instruments
and their catalogue of tunes
ranges from blues and rock to

country.

Eye and Ear:

 

To meet an author: to talk
with someone who has combin-
ed words, ideas and feelings in
ways which can send a charge
through us. It is a memorable
event even though we ourselves
are apt to feel unsure of what
say.

From time to time, the
Bookstore has held Coffee-and-
Conversation gatherings with
writers who are visiting W&L.
In the past students have had a
chance to talk with Robert
Lowell, Betty Friedan, James
Dickey and Jimmy Breslin.

Next Monday from 3:30 to
4:30 p.m. the poet Howard
Nemerov, will be in the
Bookstore to have coffee and
chat with students and friends.
The Saturday Review recently
called Howard Nemerov one of
the dozen finest poets in
America. The Collected Poems

from the Bookstore

have just been published this
past week and is what SR calls
‘“‘bonanza of a book.” Allen
Tate, no mean poet himself, has
commented that Nemerewis a

poet who writes in metrical —

verse — in plain style in which
there “‘is nothing ‘poetical’ but
it all adds up to something sub-
tle and profound.” Anyone of
use who has ever tried to write
formally structured poems
knows, agonizingly well, how
hard it is. Mr. Nemerov is a true
master.

Nemerov is an honored alum-
nus of Washington and Lee — he
received a Doctor of Letters at
graduation a few years ago. He
is also an old and good friend of
the school. His visits are always
marked by his genuine interest
in the students, with his gentle
ways in talking of words and
their myriad uses.

A Bit of the 18th Century
in the Old Troubadour...

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor
The University Theatre is
gaining momentum, as _ it
prepares for the opening night
of its second major presenta-
tion, The Beaux’ Strategem.
Originally produced in 1707, the
play is a fine example of late
Restoration comedy at its best,
and will be directed on the W&L
campus by Prof. Al Gordon,
opening just after Thanksgiv-
ing.

One especially busy man just
now is the scenic designer for
this show, Tom Ziegler. In his
second year on the W&L facul-
ty, Ziegler has already added
great distinction to the Univer-
sity Theatre with such
memorable set designs as those
from Dr. Faustus, Threepenny
Opera, and others.

The designs for an early 18th
century comedy have been
especially interesting and
rewarding for him. Even down
to the show posters and pro-
grams, everything is being done
with an eye toward historical
accuracy.

As Mr. Ziegler puts it, ‘““There
is a lot of ‘fun’ in working with
this show. The set strives to

~-recapture the architecture of

the theatres themselves by br-
inging actual box seats into the
house (see photo this page). We
will plant our own ‘audience’ in
these boxes, acting along with
the play, much in the manner of
a typical audience of 1707.
Dressed in period costumes,
this ‘audience’ will do such
things as carry on love affairs,
act out other intrigues, lead the
applause, and generally show
typical period reaction.

“The sets have been built,
and they will be changed
throughout the show in the

He ie he he ye 24 24 aie aie ae 2 2 2c

 

Here it is! The amazingly ornate, multi-tiered, candy-confection set that Tom Ziegler,
scenic designer of the University Theatre, is constructing for the next UT presentation,
THE BEAUX’ STRATEGEM. For inioré on Ziegler'and his work, see story above.

same way as it was done in the
early 1700’s. You see, there was
no space in the Restoration
playhouse to ‘fly’ the backdrops
up into the ceiling. Instead, the
‘winged shutter’ method was
used, and will be utilized here.
A series of backdrops is all it
really is, which are pulled
aside, one by one, to reveal the
backdrop of the next scene. Ob-
viously, this makes for very fast
scene changes—no need to dim
the lights or stop the action
here...

“The scenery, it must be
remembered, is just there for
its its use as spectacle. There
are no functional pieces; in
fact, the tables and chairs are
often painted on the backdrop!
The reason for this is that the
actors are often far in front of
the set anyway, either expoun-
ding their views, indulging in a
sword fight, or some other ac-
tivity quite close to the au-
dience.”

So, in essence, the set

will be open for interpretation
at many levels. On the one
hand, it can be enjoyed purely
for its spectacle—probably the
most ornate designs ever seen
in the old Troubadour. But, with
the use of those box seats and
two-dimensional interior
backdrops, the audience will
see humor beyond even the
hilarious script, in the quirks of
an age which will be on display
all around the _ actors
themselves. In fact, The Beaux’
Strategem indeed appears to be
rich with attractions—the only
upsetting thing being whether
to follow the plot of the play or
leer at the couple in the balcony
box’..

Many other ideas are in the
works for the show, which
seems to have all the energy
and enthusiasm among _ its
workers, necessary for a suc-
cess. Next week, the Ring-tum
Phi will examine the play itself,
with some comments from
director Gordon.

Poles Return to W&L!

by M. Gray Coleman

This Sunday night, November
13, at 8:30 p.m. in the
Troubadour Theatre, the Polish
Mime Company of the Warsaw
Chamber Opera Association
will return to the WaL campus
for another performance.

This mime group is a
distinguished collection of ar-
tists who have made two
previous visits to the campus.
Last October saw the first of
these visits, when the Glasgow
Endowment Committee
brought them here for a series
of performances’ and
workshops. So great was the
response, that the Committee
brought them back for five
weeks last spring, as part of the
Drama 140 styles course. At
that time, they taught students
the art of mime, and created
new entertainments for mime
especially for the W&L movice
actors.

Since that time, the group has
had a very busy schedule, the
capstone of which has been the
creation of yet another new per-
formance, entitled Meditations.
This new work is evidently a
source of great pride to the
Poles; one has called it the
finest achievement they have
had to date. And it is Medita-
tions which will be presented

next Sunday night in the

Troubadour.

The company is coming from
Greensboro, where they have
been at UNC doing workshops
and 2. performances. From
there, they will pass through
Lexington just long enough for
an overnight “friendly visit,”
while at the same time working
in one performance for the
W&L community. From there,
they’re off for a week of work in
Buffalo, and after a brief rest in
New York, their tour will con-
tinue in St. Croix, Virgin
Islands—and then, back home.

A year ago, no one could have
predicted the close ties that
would develop between these
talented artists and Washington
and Lee. But, due to their
pressive schedule, and the
distance of their home base, one
can never be sure when they
will return to campus. If you
missed their first two visits,
now is definitely the time to go
and see them inMeditations.
RESERVATIONS’ ARE
NECESSARY!!! Many seats
are already booked up but some
are availalbe, if you call

‘New York, New York’
The Land of Oz

by Seth Oserin

Hope, joy, dream and color
are all part of that fantasy that
had evolved into nothing more
than a total reflection of the pre-
sent. The restlessness of the
1960,s transformed our only real
form of escape into a classroom
of consciousness in which fan-
tasy and romanticism were an-
tique and obsolete, and all
replacements for reality were
scorned at and discarded.

But once in a while we are
reminded of the fantasy that
was Hollywood. The excitement
and anticipation reenter the at-
mosphere, and the theater, once
again, becomes a house of wor-
ship.

Such is the.case with Martin

Scorsese’s ‘‘New York, New
York.’’ Once the curtain is rais-
ed, you are suspended in a cloud
as an elated observer, not a
defendant before society’s win-
dow.

What director Scorsese has
succeeded in doing is to take the
total romanticism of the 1930’s
and 40’s and combine it with the
intensity of the 1970’s. The ef-
fect proves to be both unusual
and stimulating. Surrealistic as
well as realistic sets are used
interchangeably, but sym-
bolism plays only a very minor
role in this story. You are there
to enjoy, not to study.

Voices entertain
in Chapel

by Ned McDonnell

On Tuesday night, Voices
Inc., the highly acclaimed
Manhattan black theatre troupe
staged a ‘‘Roots’’ type of play,
“Journey Into Blackness.”’ The
piece, intended to increase
Black Awareness among all
Lexingtonians (with the white
community in particular), fail-
ed to attain its desired effect in
two areas.

First of all, the first half of the
production, from Africa to the
Civil War, scanned _ the
historical period too briefly,
(e.g. Harriet Tubman,
antebellum black underground
leader for freedom, was men-
tioned at glance one time
throughout the play). In addi-
tion, certain historical errors
were also present. For one, the
black consciousness musical
strongly implied that Euro-
peans captured the slaves. The
truth was that slavery was in-
troduced to the Western World
through the systems of slavery
present in Africa where the
kings of certain tribes had sub-
jugated the blacks of other
tribes to involuntary servitude.

SABU-sponsored group which
performed last Tuesday in Lee
Chapel. For details, see story
this page...

Through the combination of the
desire of the African
slaveholders to trade off
residual slaves and the need of
the whites for cheap labor as
agricultural resources, the in-
stitution of slavery germinated
and later thrived in Western
Society. Later in the first half,
the drama implied that planta-
tion owners were insensitive to
the needs of their slaves thus
minimizing the benevolent
paternalism which existed on
many plantations. Such factual
distortions served only to in-
crease the relative culpability
of the white man in order to
enhance the sympathy of the
audience for the lot of the black
man.

The second half, however,
saw a vast improvement in its
excellence of portraying the
black up until 1950 and how
blacks coped with the hell of the
unfair work-week, their blues,
with wine, women, and jazz on
Saturday nights and gospel
singing on Sunday morning. In-
deed the weekend became the
black man’s recreational and
tension releasing institution.
But the play faltered on the last
scene about the protests, wren-
ching freedoms for blacks from
the whites. Again the cast
overlooked an_ important

Close Losses Bring

Losing Streak to Nine

The W&L soccer Generals
dropped two road contests and
one home event last weekend
losing t 3-1 to James Madison,
2-1 to Virginia Tech, and 3-0 to
the University of Virginia in the
VISA playoffs. The Tech loss
was especially heart-breaking
as it came after two ten minute
overtime perids played in a
driving rainstorm in
Blacksburg, Virginia.

W&L scored first in the Hokie
game on a free kick by Junior
Bill Stone, and led 1-0 at the

scored what proved to be the
eventual winner mid-way
through the second overtime.

Against the University of
Virginia last Tuesday the
Generals played the Wahoos

seven minutes of the game.
Virginia led 1-0 at the end of the
first half. In the final seven
minutes scored twice to ice the
match and advance to the finals

Two Point Conversion Fails;
Generals’ Streak Stopped

by Pete Abitante

After two straight victories in
which the Generals dominated
their opponents to the point of
submission, it seemed that only
an act of God could halt their
momentum and bid for a third
consecutive win. But as luck
would have it, that seems to
have been exactly the case, as
the Generals lost a tough one to
the Wasps of Emory and Henry
74.

Torrential downpours
through the week transformed
what was once a football field
into an ugly quagmire hamper-
ing the offensive capabilities of
both teams.

With the offense shut down, it
was a day for the defense to
clear the mud from their eyes

and play their best. That’s ex-
actly what they did. The
Generals’ defensive play which
was one of the finest of the
season, turned back several
Emory and Henry scoring
threats after turnovers in W&L
territory.

While the entire defensive
unit played well, special men-
tion goes to linebackers Carl
Folcik, who intercepted two
Wasp passes, Jeff Slatcoff,

Fencers Not Foiled By Foes

by Rex Nyquist
The newly formed Fencing
club won its first meet against
James Madison University on
Saturday 16-13. It was the first
time W&L has fielded a fencing
squad since 1942.

Six W&L fencers participated
in the meet, which used the
scoring standards prescribed
by the American Fencing
League Association. Each one
of W&L’s fencers met each one
of Madison,s once, for a total of
thirty matches.

Sophomore Paul Nathan and
junior Herb. Jennings each
registered four victories for the

Generals. David Garner, John
Stathakis and Rob Earle garned
two victories apiece, while Bill
Hill and Willy Mackie each ac-
cumulated a point for the team.
Hill and Captain Will Wendt
fenced saber, while the rest of
the team fenced foil.

Dr. James Worth, the club’s
sponsor and coach, was ex-
tremely proud of the team’s
performance. He said that they
fenced with ‘‘great en-
thusiasm.’’ He also com-
plimented the dedication of the
fencers, noting that most of the
equipment they use is paid for
by themselves. Dr. Worth hopes
that. fencing can become an
established sport at Washington

and Lee. He stressed that the
club still needs some financial
support, as it is largely in-
dependently funded.

The next meet is tentatively
scheduled for February. The
club then hopes to fence VMI,
George Mason, Vanderbilt and
Madison.

Meanwhile, the fencers con-
tinue to practice hard every
weekday on the fifth floor of the
gym. A student who stopped by
for a few minutes remarked
that the clubs fencers
displayed: ‘‘A good sense of
camaraderie. They help each
other a lot. Nobody fools
around, and everybody takes
the sport seriously.”

freshman tackle Joe Wallace
who had his best game in a
W&L uniform. The defense held
Emory and Henry to 208 total
yards, including 97 . yards
rushing which marked the third
straight week the W&L “Big
1” has held opponents to under
100 yards rushing. a

Emory and Henry began its
lone scoring drive of the day on
the W&L 32. Seven plays later,
aided by a critical pass in-
terference call on fourth down,
quarterback Mike Roberts con-
nected with tight end Mike
Snow on an eight yard scoring
strike with 5:29 remaining in
the first half. Jeff Done kicked
what proved to be the winning
point, and Emory and Henry led
at the half 7-0.

The W&L offense failed to
capitalize on two golden op-
portunities in the second half.
Recovering a Wasp fumble with
9:23 left in the third quarter the
Generals had a first and ten
from the Emory and Henry
eleven yard line. A run for a one
yard loss and three incomplete
passes left the Generals empty
handed. The second muffed oc-
casion came with 11:23 remain-
ing in the game when the
Generals had a first and ten

from the E-H 36 yard line only
to be intercepted on third down.

But the W&L offense did not
become discouraged and in fact
had to get in the game the hard
way—an 80 yard drive. With
4:24 remaining in the game,
W&L had a first down on its
own twenty. Quickly they mov-
ed down the field on seven
plays, including a 30 yard pass
to Richie Wiles, a 19 yard com-
pletion to Bob Szczecinski, and
a 16 yard run by quarterback
Ted Hissey. With 1:17 left on the
clock, Stu Atkinson took it in
from two yards out for the
touchdown. The Generals
gallantly tried to win the game
with a two point conversion but
a Hissey pass intended for Wiles
in the corner of the endzone was
batted away by a strong E-H
pass rush.

The Generals got the ball
back on their own 25 yard line
with :13 seconds remaining, but
the clock expired with W&L on
the Wasp 36 yard line. Final
E-H7, W&L6.

This week the Generals face
Gettysburg College. The Bullets
are also 2-7 on the year and
were crushed by Lehigh last
week 47-4). W&L beat Get-

Cross-Country Team

Takes 4th In ODAC

by Clem Carter
The ODAC Cross Country
Championship meet was held at
Roanoke College last Saturday.
In the heavy rain the Generals
could only manage a fourth
place finish.

Eastern Mennonite College,
led by the ODAC’s most
valuable runner Kenny
‘Laymen, with 29 points took the
conference championship.
Eastern Mennonite coach Elton
Horst was named the ODAC’s
coach of the year. Bridgewater
provided stiff competition for
Eastern Mennonite coming in
second with 37 points’ Lyn-
chburg College and Washington
and Lee battled it out for third
place. Lynchburg managed to
edge out the Generals by only
four points, their point total was
81, W&L’s was 85. Roanoke Col-
lege finished in fifth place with
152 points. Emory and Henry
and - Hampden-Sydney were
sixth and seventh respectively.
Their point totals were 180 and
182.

In the meet the Generals were
led by senior co-captain Allen
Weeks who captured 10th place.
Weeks’ time was 28 minutes and
nine seconds. Richard Bird
came in six seconds after
Weeks finishing 11th. Bob Bates
was the third General runner
coming in the 18th place. Bates
ran the 8000 meter course in 28
minutes 47 seconds. The fifth
General runner was Brian
Adams who came in two places
after Daniels. Adams was only
eight seconds behind Daniels.
The sixth and seventh
Washington and Lee runners,

27th and 29th overall, were
Hans Furuland and senior co-
captain Bill Welch. Senior
Kevin Grommy was the eighth
General.

According to Coach Miller the
Generals had gone into the meet
hopeful of beating Lynchburg
and had a possible shot at se-
cond place. Miller was not
dissatisfied with the team’s per-
formance, however. The point
spread between Lynchburg and
W&L was just four points.

As far as the entire season,
goes Miller was pleased with
the team’s performance. A win-
ning season is the goal he had
hoped for, the Generals were 10
wins and five losses. Miller said
that if the individual runners
are satisfied with their per-
formances then he is also. The
fact that the Generals made it
through the season without any
major injuries was perhaps the
best part of the season for
Miller.

Although only eight Generals
ran in the championship meet,
the Cross Country team was
comprised of 22 members. Of
the 22 runners all of them ran in
at least one meet. Miller prais-
ed all of the members on the
team for the amount of time and

sacrifice the runners had spent
in practice.

On Monday the Cross Country
team held a team meeting in
which the 1978-79 co-captains
were elected. They are Bob
Bates, class of 79 and Richard

, Bird, class of 80.

W&L Swimmers: |
Why Not The Best’

by Heartsill Ragon

Most W&L students are quite
familiar with the fame and suc-
cess of the W&L lacrosse, ten-
nis and basketball teams. But
sometimes the swimming team
tends to go unnoticed; enclosed
in a steamy, humid corner of
the gymnasium; shrowded
from student enthusiasm and
participation.

This year Coach Bill Stearns’
swimming team is out to prove
it too can join the winning and
highly-praised ranks of W&L
athletics.

Stearns has set his goals
high: he plans to have an entire
team of All-Americans. The
swimmers also have set their
goals high: many have been
practicing since the beginning
of school; others are swimming
a total of 10,000 yards per day.

The first test of the 1977-78
W&L swimming Generals will
come this weekend as the team
travels to Pennsylvania for
their first swimming encounter

of the year: the Millersville Col-
lege relays.

Thirteen strong teams from
the East Coast are expected to
attend ‘this weekend event—
teams which include several of
the powerhouse’ teams
Washington and Lee will face in
the upcoming year.

Coach Stearns will be calling
on an assortment of veterans as
well as rookies to meet his
demanding goals.

With the loss of superstar
swimmer Ted Van Leer,
Stearns said he will be forced to
rely on freshman Scott Duff and
Bob Newcomb. Filling in for
Van Leer is no easy task as
Stearns realizes. He admits that
they both are slower than the
grad, but adds they have good
potential and three years of
competition and practice.

Senior John Hudson will be
called upon to carry away the
most awards for the team. A 13-
time All-American, Hudson is
by far the best swimmer on the

Juniors Chip Hoke and Keith

Americans, have shown great
motivation on the team so far
this year. Coming to school two
weeks before the start of
classes, these men have been
building up to 10,000 yard-per-
day practice sessions.

Drew Pillsbury, Will Hodges
and Peter Botts Meem round
out this team of All-American

hopefuls.
In addition to W&L’s ex-
cellent swimming team

members, Coach Stearns will
field the first competitive div-
ing team in recent years.
Freshmen Jay Diesing and
George Irvine will be diving for
W&L and according to Stearns,
both have shots at the All-
American honors.

The enthusiasm and outlook
of the W&L swimming
Generals is promising and
Coach Stearns seems set to
return to the nationals with a
full roster of All-American can-
didates. He summed up the
outlook: ‘‘We’re gonna have a
great team.”’

New York, New York: Good
Town, Wonderful Movie

(continued from page 5)
huge Rainbow Room—like New
York night club where Robert
DeNero clumsily attempts a
pick-up of Liza Minnelli. The
rest of the story centers around
both their personal and their
professional (he is a sax player
and she is a singer) lives,
which, it is soon discovered,
become harder and harder to
separate.

Very rarely do you see two ac-
tors interact the way Minnelli
and DeNero do in this movie.
They work off each other in a
way that would make any aspir-
ing actor envy. Both profes-

sionals are superb, with intense
performances constantly !eav-
ing electricity in the air. The
highlight scene—the trip to the
maternity ward—brings this in-
tensity to a climax. Minnelli is
her usual non-exhausting self,
with a performance of the title
song that reminds one so much
of her mother, Judy Garland,
that you need the close-up shots
to remind you who is really on
stage.

Music is provided primarily
by Ebb and Kander, although
you feel lucky when you get to

- hear an entire song. The reason

for this is probably that most of
those songs aren’t worth hear-
ing entirely. However, those
that you do hear in full are good,
with the dynamic title song
highlighting the production’s
music.

The big ten minute production
number has been cut down to
almost nothing, which is a
disappointment to many of us
old Hollywood fans. In addition,
the movie does seem _ un-
necessarily long. However, you
don't really mind. The excite-
ment doesn’t let you. Starts Fri-
day at the State.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

E.C. inaction condemned

If Washington and Lee’s Executive Committee
represented the American judicial system, there
would be no doubt as to why crime is increasing
steadily in this country. The E.C. failed even to repri-
mand Contact co-chairman John Bruch for his com-
mittee’s misuse of student funds at an open hearing
Monday night. Instead, the E.C. allowed itself to be
subjected to reprimands by Bruch for its questioning
of Contact’s activities. The hearing was made a fur-
ther farce with the absence of this year’s co-
chairmen, Webster and Granruth.

In essense, Bruch told the E.C. that it should stay
out of Contact’s affairs because the E.C. did not total-
ly finance Contact. He also helpfully pointed out that
the E.C. would become too overpowering if it tried to
regulate Contact’s expenditures. In defeating Rick
Goddard’s motion 8-1, the E.C. showed obvious agree-
ment with Bruch.

The members of Contact were wrong in throwing
the party without E.C. approval and in secretly keep-
ing the leftover money from 1977. No matter how
they try to justify their abuses., they will always
come up wrong in the end. If this year’s E.C. is unwill-
ing to do anything about such abuses and misuses of
student funds, then the present E.C. should be recall-
ed and a new, more responsible one elected.

These actions of Contact are abuses. In secretly
keeping the leftover funds, not only were these
members acting less than honorably, they directly
violated Article IX, Section B of the student body con-
stitution. Bruch: aruged that co-chairmen were
capable of using their own good judgement in deter-
mining expenditures, what they will be and where
they will go. He also argued that since the members of
Contact worked so hard they were entitled to a party.
And since 15% of their monies come from outside
sources, other than student money, they have the
right to throw any type of party any time they want.

Rubbish! The members of Contact as well as the
members of every other committee on campus are in
the advantageous position of having access to student
funds, and also are able to acquire other donations
and contributions through the use of the name of their
organization, the objective of their organization, and
the efforts they represent. These monies are acquired
from donors on the assumption that they will be used
for the express purpose for which they were re-
quested. Why should these members § glorify
themselves and the duties for which they volunteered
by throwing themselves parties financed from other
people’s pockets? The average man on campus
never gets the opportunity to have a “‘free’’ party for
himself and his special, selected group of friends. Stu-
dent committee members should fee rewarded by the
satisfaction of having done a good job and not feel
they are ‘‘owed”’ something else.

Under Article V Section M of the student body con-
stitution, the E. C. has the power to regulate student
committees. On Monday night the E. C. failed to live
up to its responsibilities. It is time the E.C. stopped
being wishy-washy, stopped adhering to the ‘khaki
culture,’”’ and stopped honoring corrupt traditions.
Violations must be punished, rules must be enforced
and precedents must be set. If the members of this
year’s E. C. are unwilling to accept the respon-
sibilities entrusted to them last March, then students
should begin to question their own March voting deci-
sions, seriously consider the option of recall, and
begin circulating petitions.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry

Tipping?

Dear Editor:

In the four years I have been
in the W&L community there
have been numerous changes.
One of the most outstanding
changes has occurred in the
Cockpit. In my freshmen year
they had just received a license
to serve beer other than 3.2 (this
was due to Virginia liquor
laws). Throughout the years the
Cockpit has evolved to become
what I consider a restaurant,
which also provides entertain-
ment for its patrons. The
Cockpit is a genuine option for
dates these days. This stems
almost completely from the fact
that they have installed a policy
of table service. Now, one can
go in and sit down to order; as
opposed to the old counter ser-
vice at the bar. There is only
one element missing in the
Cockpit, yet it is not the fault of
the Cockpit personnel. I am
referring to the policy of tipp-
ing. Faculty and guests seem to
be the only ones who tip. So that
the trend of good service can
continue, let your waiter or
waitress know that you ap-
preciate their hustle. The
Cockpit not only has good enter-
tainment and food, but ex-
cellent management in the per-
sons of Jerry Darrell, Burr Datz
and Dan Scott, who are willing
to listen to constructive
criticism and new ideas. Many
people are working hard to
make the Cockpit a nice place
for the students, so let’s make it
a nice place for them to work. In
other words, let’s start tipping
to show our appreciation for
good service.

Sincerely yours,
Douglas R. Perkins

Dear Editor:

This letter is to clarify the ar-

cerning the recently approved
visitor policy for the law school.
Contrary to that article, all of
the carrels in the law school
library are restricted to use by

GUIDELINES FOR USE OF LEWIS HALL

It is the policy of the Student
Bar Association of Washington
and Lee Law School that Lewis
Hall shall be open to all persons
who desire to use its legal
research facilities. Limitations
of space and the need for quiet
require, however, that there be
certain restrictions on the use of
the facilities.

The primary intended use for
Lewis Hall is for legal research
and legal study. Law students
and those engaged in legal
research, at all times, have
priority in the use of the
facilities. That this purpose
shall be met, those who are
disruptive or by their presence
displace those engaged in the
aforementioned intended use of
Lewis Hall, will be required to
leave. Those persons who fail to

Dear Editor:

After reading yet another
sensationalist-oriented article
concerning the SAB and its
finances, I feel I must reply
again to alleged improprieties
dof use of student body funds.
The basis for the lead article
and editorial of last week’s RTP
was a misquote of Jack Bovay,
junior EC rep. His quoted state-
ment that the SAB had not been
keeping receipts is simply er-
roneous.

 

From this you editorially ©

state that “the people who head
and serve on the various com-
mittees and organizations
around campus have no concep-
tion of what it means to use and
have access to other people’s
money” and that a “gross
disregard for the procedure and

policy laid down by the EC con-

cerning the use of student
funds” has occurred.

All of this is based on a mis-
quote. How many other of the
articles that have appared in
the RTP are based on other
flimsy evidences? I will per-
sonally state that ere has not
been an error free article writ-
ten on the SAB this year. That is
shoddy journalism.

You go on to state that
students should be ‘‘made
aware that they are answerable
to an authority on campus for
deceitful and dishonorable ac-
tions.’ I will remind you, Mr.
Gallagher, that the EC, not the
RTP is that authority. They are
the decision-making body on
campus. The headline of last
week (which suffered from poor
layout) said that the SAB was in
trouble. From whom? — the
RTP? If so — so what?

The EC meeting of last Mon-
day night was anticlimatic in
relation to the build-up it receiv-
ed in the RTP. The “inquiry”
that could have resulted in ‘‘an
automatic honor violation”
lasted about three minutes. Was
that event worthy of front page
status? :

4th estate

You end your editorial saying
that if the EC does not react to
these alleged ‘“‘gross offenses,
‘honor’ may well become a
term inapplicable to this cam-
pus community.”’ You make an
appeal to honor, but in previous
editorals have talked of such
honorable activities as rack-
dates.

I think that you, Mr.
Gallagher, are aware that an
editorial is an_ influential
medium. The week before the
EC was to decide on whether or
not to have salaries for publica-
tion heads you ran an editorial
praising the EC for a fine job
that they had done. The motion
to allow salaries to be paid with
monies from students funds was
passed by the EC that week.

If the business manager this
year is doing his job, you stand
to make a fairly substantial
sum of money this spring. If the
figure from your predecessor is
an accurate one, you will make
about $500. The question I will
raise now is — when are we go-
ing to see our money’s worth?

You are in the position among
student groups to be able to
stand in front of the proverbial
fan with the shovel of prover-
bial fertilizer aiming at
whichever peer group you
desire. That position is akin to
having your cake (a position of
authority in a student group)
and eating it too ( being able to
degrade peer groups). Now
since the EC has voted to allow
Salaries, you will be paid for
eating your cake. It is not that I
am desiring a piece of the cake,
I just want a little less fertilizer
and a little more quality in
future Ring-tum Phi’s.

Bill Tucker, ‘79

The RtP was not alone in
hearing Mr. Bovay’s remarks
concerning the SAB. EC
representative Rick Goddard
told the Phi the quote was ac-
curate.

Dear Editor:

I was greatly dismayed by
your editorial of last week, in
which you incorrectly stated
that I had accused the Student
Activities Board of abusing
study body funds. The use of
this second hand information as
the basis for an_ editorial,
without even talking to me
about the matter, is actually an
abuse of your editorial powers.

- At the Executive Committee
meeting of October 31, I did
state that the S.A. B. had not ob-
tained the night deposit bags re-
quired by E.C. accounting
guidelines, and that the Board’s
funds had not been placed in the
accounts of its various subcom-
mittees. These problems, which
stemmed from a lack of com-
munication among the in-
dividuals involved, have since
been cleared up to the complete
satisfaction of the E.C.

Jim Foreman, treasurer of
the S.A.B., has kept completely
accurate accounting records,
with a receipt for every expen-
diture. I would like to take this
opportunity to commend Jim,

Editor:
In light of your reporting and
comments pertaining to the

Contact Committee’s use and:
maintanence of funds,. which.

appeared in the November 3
issue of your newspaper, it is
necessary to enlighten you on
several points.

 

Once Upon

Dear Editor:

Once upon a time in a. little
town in the hills, there lived a
group of men who suffered for
years in seemingly abject
poverty. They lived in shacks on
the outside of town and huddled
daily in a tottering building to
work. This building was
outrageously inadequate in that
it was too old, too small, too in-
accessible, but these men con-
tinued to work hard to support
their families. Somehow,
however, many men rose from
these conditions, became wise
and in turn, were admired for
their wisdom, in spite of these
facilities.

Next to these men worked a
younger group of men who were
just as hard-working, but much
more fortunate. Many of these
could afford many of life’s lux-

A Time...

uries, lived in nicer homes,
drove fancier cars, and
sometimes even threw better
parties. Naturally, from time to
time tensions arose between
these different groups, pushing
them apart. But the young men
were willing to accept the dif-
ferences, and shared what they
could with the older group, and
both groups co-existed happily
for many years.

Then one day, a wise man
decided that it was time to help
out the older men, and he built
them a new factory, a marvel
by the technological standards
of the day. The older men re-
joiced for days and nights, both
for their new building and for its
position—close to the younger
men who they had learned to
love as friends. The older men
even left the old factory to the
younger men, in hopes that with
their youth, they could rebuild

it.
Over the years, many of the
men of both groups passed on,

until few were left who could -

remember how life once was.
Some who remained felt
nostalgia in their hearts for the
way things used to be, Some
older men, confident within the
walls of their factory, decided
that the younger men were too
brash and_ disrespectful—of
their property, and voted to
keep the young men out. The
younger men were outraged,
and tried to recall for the older
men how well they used to live
together, but to no avail. The
older men did not listen to the
younger men, and locked their
doors to them. Sadness existed
where cooperation once had,
and the little town in the hills
was never the same.
Despairingly yours,

Firstly, Contact, and the Con-
tact ‘77 program being a case in
point, derives its funds from
three sources: the EC, the IFC
and donations from parents.
The first two groups respective-
ly allocated 53% and 28% of
Contact’s overall funds. The re-
mainder of the monies were ob-
tained from generous and in-
terested parents by means of
direct solicitation in the form of
a letter.

Secondly, Contact ‘77 did in-
deed have money remaining at
the program’s conclusion.
Again this amount was not from
one particular source, but from
three. The cash surplus was at-
tributed to the following: the in-
ability of one scheduled speaker
or a suitable replacement to ap-
pear, a greater than expected
response from W&L parents
(thus indicating their heralding
of past Contact programs and
faith in Contact ‘77) and the
hard working and prudent ef-
forts of committee members.

Thirdly, last year,s co-
chairman inherited many prac-
tices and means of operation,
most of which were deemed
worthwhile and just. Among the
many carry-over procedures
was a beginning cash balance
and the extension of generous
hospitality to guest speakers
which has been a hallmark of
Contact and this university. It
was last year’s co-chairman‘s
hope that these proven pro-
cedures and necessary costs for
success would be perpetuated.
It should be noted that the din-
ner alluded to for Mr. Jenner
and his wife did occur. It includ-

ed committee members, some.

dates, the President of the IFC
and a senior EC representative
(also a Contact member). The
president of the EC was also in-
vited. Further, past Contact
Committees have concluded
their efforts with similar func-
tions for dedicated members
and guest speakers.

Thus, your statement imply-
ing that student body money

Notice

Proof showings of senior pic-
tures will end Friday. If you
have not already picked out the

in the year book, drop by the
Calyx office in the University
Center today or tomorrow and
do so. The Calyx staff will pick

Tucker, Bovay and Bruch criticize

altogether true as evidenced b
the sources cited. Your state
ment that Contact had $500.

remaining is false and un

substantiated. To return all off

Contact’s ending balance to the
EC would not be fair to the other
contributors. The EC should in-
deed ask for an accounting of
student funds, and _ student
funds only.

In conclusion your newspaper
has once again printed unfound-
ed remarks and resorted to sen-
sationalism. Such erroneous
reporting week after week is
causing the RtP to join the
ranks of Hustler and Midnight
Magazine. As evidenced by
other student publications on
this campus, controversy is not
a requisite for quality.

Hopefully in your remaining
issues the quality of your stories
and accuracy thereof will im-
prove. The W&L community is
very much in need of a respec-
table student-run newspaper of
which they may be proud. The
RtP owes such respect not only
to its readers but also to its
heritage.

Sincerely,

John L. Bruch III
Co-Chairman
Contact ‘77

Mr. Bruch, we refer you to this
year’s November 3 issue of the
RtP where it was reported that
1978 Contact co-chairman Billy
Webster told the RtP that $500
was remaining from last year.
Also, how can you say this
figure is false when you admit-
ted at the EC meeting Monday
night that you didn’t know
specifically what the remaining
sum of money was? Concern-
ing sensationalism, as long as
students find it within
themselves to consciously
violate the student body con-
stitution, as long as their own
actions are sensational in
nature, the RtP will continue to
report them.

Professor Machado questioned
its six credit rating and the very
nature of the course, which will
be taught in conjunction with
Mary Baldwin College. Again,
discussion passed between
faculty and administration
members.

Students did raise questions
about a pre-calculus course and
the seeming unwillingness of
the Mathematics department to
institute one. But any substan-
tive discussion was put off until
the next meeting because no
representatives from the Math
department were present.

Approval was voted to recom-

GPA’s up
winter

semester

by Charles Adler

Freshmen, if your GPA
wasn’t what you expected, don’t
despair! Past freshmen
classes, grades have improved
markedly in the Winter terms.
The increased experience and
adjustment of freshmen by
winter results in fewer F’s and
a higher GPA. In the 74-75
academic year, for example,
the average GPA went from a
2.129 to a 2.384 while the number
of freshmen with an average
below a 1.5 dropped from 64 to
35.

This year’s freshmen mid
fall-term average GPA is 2.50,
the highest of any in recent
years. This year’s freshmen
class also has a low number of
students with grades below a 1.5
average with a mere 48 out of a
class of 357 in this category.
There were however more F’s
received by freshmen than in
past years, a total of 119 being
given so far as compared with
89 at the same time last year.

the handouts and ask questions
about the actions and proposals.
This is the student ‘‘input’’
aspect which gives the students
‘“‘an involvement in the univer-
sity government process.”’

Discussion began concerning
the acceptance of summer
school credits. The Committee
on Courses and Degrees recom-
mended in their October 11th
meeting that the rule as it now
stands should be retained: that
a student should obtain advance
approval for any summer
school course he takes, other-
wise, he takes his chances on
whether or not the course
credits will be accepted. Debate
was carried mostly by faculty
members, with Student Body
president Jim Underhill pro-
viding the only student input. A
motion was passed, 16-3, that
students should ask about a
summer school course before
they take it.

The next topic of discussion

Byrd,

receive

Two Washington and Lee
University students have been
selected to receive the Lewis
Kerr Johnson Commerce
Scholarship, awarded annually
by W&L’s School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics.

The two are Douglas A. Byrd
of Baton Route, La., and Jerry
M. Baird of Fort Worth, Tex.
Byrd, a junior, was selected for
the first time. Baird, one of last
year’s two recipients, had his
scholarship renewed.

Baird is a business ad-
ministration major and a
member of the honorary frater-
nities: Phi Beta Kappa, Beta
Gamma Sigma in commerce,
and Phi Eta Sigma for
freshman-year achievement.
He is also a member of W&L’s

the Faculty Executive Commit-
tee, revealed that the results of
the Faculty EC’s poll showed
the faculty to be “‘overwhelm-
ing in favor of retaining an in-
dependent examination
schedule.’ He briefly discussed
the poll and its results, fielding
questions about the poll and in-
dependent exams in general. In
a 21-1 vote, the UC endorsed the
Faculty EC’s recommendation
to continue independent ex-
aminations.

As a final matter of business,
Professor Sessions introduced a
motion which would limit the
University Council’s meetings
to take place “only when call-
ed...upon the request either of
the President of the university
or of at least six council
members.” He debated briefly
with Professor Goldsten, but
further discussion was tabled
until the next meeting on
December Ist.

WLUR covers returns

The land slide victory for
Republican John Dalton and
early decisions in other area
races reulted in a surprisingly
early sign off for WLUR elec-
tion coverage Tuesday night.

The radio station signed off at
1l p.m. as the gubernatorial
races and most of the minor
races were decided by that time
rather than the 1 a.m. finish
that WLUR News Director Ed
Burgess had expected.

The evening started out hec-
tically as last minute details
were being worked out. During
the first hour the engineers
struggled to keep pace with the
number of raped features, as
the first results began to trickle
in from the polls. As results
came in, the newsmen had
more to talk about and the
Virginia Public Radio Election
Network feeds provided some
relief to the election staff.

One factor that enabled
WLUR to complete its coverage
so early was the pro t response
of the field reporters who were
covering the polls throughout
Rockbridge County. All but one
of Burgess’s reporters called in
their stories and most state
results were reported soon after
the polls closed.

WLUR was able to provide

coverage of the progress of
races around the state as well
as on the local secne because of
its arrangements with the
Virginia Public Radio Election
Network. The radio station was
able to carry the VPREN by
trading local results for permis-
sion to rebroadcast the signal of
WMRA in Harrisonburg.

Burgess was aided by assis-
tant news director, Steve Mat-
tesky, who co-anchored the
election coverage. Other
members of his staff included:
Charlie Smith, covering the
Buena Vista flood wall issue;
Joe Dashiell, who did research
on the candidates; and John
Kingston who covered other
races around the state and the
nation.

The field reporters who called
in results from the polls includ-
ed Cope Moyers, Ken Mastrilli,
Todd Tyson and Kingston. The
first precincts to report showed
an early lead for loser Henry
Howell. The trend changed bet-
ween 8:30 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.
and Dalton’s lead continued to
widen. The Associated Press
declared Dalton the winner at
about 10 p.m. After that it was
all downhill.

Republicans took two of the
top three posts in the state. In

stalled while tests are being run
on the sophisticated equipment.

Complications arose last
week when the present PDPA
computer broke down and the
computer classes were left
without an operating computer.

Plans as of now are to pur-
chase 20 or more simple ter-
minals at a cost of $1000 each
and to purchase sophisticated
terminals costing between
$5,000 and $10,000.

The computer has true virtual
memory with 100,000 discs. The
unit also will employ the
statistical package for social
sciences. Roberts says this is
the most widely used social
science package in the country.

The hope is that final testing

the race for Lt. Governor,
Democrat Charles Robb en-
joyed an early victory over his
opponent, Joe Canada. The
Republicans took the third seat
in the election of the “Big
Three’’ when J. Marshall Col-
eman clinched the Attorney
General spot.

A great deal of stress was
placed on the coverage of local
elections in hopes of capturing a
greater section of the area’s au-
dience. Most of the staff was
assigned to cover these races
because details for other races
in the state could be obtained
from the AP wire and the net-
work. . In local races, Charles
“‘Bunny’’ Gunn and Lacey E.
Putney were reelected to the
House of Delgates for the Ninth
District and Patricia DeLaney,
a Democrat, was reelected Lex-
ington City Treasurer over op-
ponent James Sheridan. In
other other issue of great local
importance the Buena Vista
flood wall proposal was
defeated.

The election staff at WLUR
was pleased with its coverage of
the elections and the mood was
quite jovial as staff members
flooded the floor of Studio A
shortly after the station signed
off at 11 p.m.

will be completed on November
9th.

The computer will use ‘‘flop-
py discs which look like 45 rpm
records.’’ This is designed to
save computer space.

The tape units will be located
in the rear of the computer
center next to the main frame to
keep it from student access.

Students will not be permitted
to use the card reader and line
operator during the day without
an operator, however, they can
use this equipment during off
hours.

The terminals will be “‘up’’ 24
hours a day and Roberts said
“the hope is that 24 terminals
will be in operation this time
next year.”’

Landslide victory for Dalton
ae ae ae ae oe ae a on oo

Republicans celebrate

by David Talley

The Republican victory party
officially began in the ballroom
of the R. E. Lee Hotel at 7 p.m.
with the closing of the polls.
Two hours later, Steve Yeakel,
chairman of the Dalton for
Governor campaign in Lex-
ington, announced that UPI had
declared John Dalton the win-
ner of the governor’s race in
Virginia. The end of a tough
campaign had finally arrived,
and in this case, it was a happy
ending.

While the group was
celebrating Dalton’s victory, a
new surprise was developing. J.
Marshall Coleman, Republican
candidate for Attorney Gener-
nal, was winning in Lexington
and Rockbridge County by big-
ger margins than expected. In
the long run, things worked out
right, and Virginia had elected
its first Republican Attorney
General.

For many of the Republicans
present at the victory party,
both senior party members and
W&L College Republicans
alike, the campaign began back
in June with the Virginia
Republican Convention. The
hard campaigning did not real-
ly get underway in the area un-
til September, when the CR’s
returned to school.

The effect of the W&L CR’s
was widespread. ‘‘There was

really no organized campaign
effort in this area until the W&L
CR’s took over,”’ states Yeakel.
‘‘We organized the area cam-
paign and provided many of the
workers. In addition, the club
has a good rapport with the
senior party and we work well
together.”

Yeakel, who is also President
of the Washington and Lee
Republicans, attributes the
large vote for Dalton in the area
to the hard work done on elec-
tion day. Using the results of the
phone canvass, ‘‘we identified
our voters and turned out every
favorable Dalton voter in East
and West Lexington.” The
W&L GOP Club assisted in
phoning favorable voters, as
well as manning the polls. ‘‘A
lot of people contributed to this
effort,’ said Yeakel, “‘but I
especially appreciate the ef-
forts of Steve Rodgers, CR
Campaign Chairman, Mary
Huffman, who was the founda-
tion of the headquarters, and
Henry Wise (area campaign
treasurer), who never let me
stop running.”’

Thus, a successful campaign
effort came to a climax Tues-
day evening with John Dalton’s
win in Lexington, and subse-
quently in the whole state. It
prompted Yeakel to quip: ‘‘As
Lexington goes, so goes
Virginia.”

Entertainment in Lex.

(continued from page 3)

So far, he added, his weekend
audiences have been picking
up“‘building slowly.”’

Spanky’s

Spanky’s Delicatessen also
has decided to get at a piece of
the student entertainment in-
terest. With a new addition that
will double the dining room size,
Emory Leffel, manager of
Spanky’s has found room to in-
clude a small stage for local and
area musicians.

Leffel said this new addition
had been scheduled for opening
the first of December but,
because of delays, the opening
date was forced back until the
middle of December.

Basically, Leffel will be look-
ing for talented blue grass and
soft, classical guitar players to
entertain beer drinkers and pro-
vide background music for his
dining room crowds.

musical format will be, ac-
cording to Leffel, to create a
mellow atmosphere while draw-
ing an enthusiastic crowd.

Entertainment—good
entertainment—is ready to be
found by W&L students. If it’s
not at the Cockpit then it’s at
one of the other four eateries
around town that are trying to
cater to the likes and dislikes of
the students.

Is it possible that this new in-
terest in area entertainment
could spread to W&L? Could a
night on Main Street replace a
night at Sweet Briar?

Clyde Mull seemed to sum up
the state of entertainment af-
fairs in Lexington when he
reported, “I can’t seem to
generate any interest.”

Assassination
attempt fails

An attempt was made on J.
Michael Gallagher's life
Wednesday afternoon when a
smoke bomb was hurled at him
from a 4th floor Graham-Lee
dormitory window. Gallagher,
who was talking with Mock Con-
vention chairman John Trump
about the merits of a free press,
escaped the assassination at-
tempt without injury. A visibly
shaken Gallagher remarked to
reporters, ‘‘I need a vacation..”’

an honor violation. Perkins said
it is ridiculous to think that “‘If
they lose a receipt for a pencil
sharpener, it’s an honor viola-

After the discussion was over,
Goddard’s motion was voted
down. Goddard was the only
person to vote for the motion,
while Borden abstained. Jim
Underhill, Jack Bovay, Mike
Missal, Steve Abraham, Andy
Bodenstab, Jim Davis,
Christophere Gammon and

Jenner, that it cost about $115
and that it was held in the Col-

The big plan to get psyched

optimistic plan, as of right now,
is to have five days of solid
entertainment in the Pit. The

would be to have a crazy movie

to the dinner. Bruch said Alfred
Robinson, the past year’s Inter
Fraternity Council president
was invited, as well as Contact
members, dates. The persons
invited were ‘‘left up to the
discretion of the Contact co-
chairmen,’ he said.

Bruch defended the dinner in
part because two EC members
knew about it. He said their
knowledge implied consent to
the dinner. Goddard responded
that it “implied consent from
two guys who wanted a nice din-
ner.”’

Bruch said Contact’s propos-
ed budget for dinners was $100.
He said Contact ‘‘most definite-
ly went over” its $100 budget.

speaker has in Lexington as
part of his Contact itinerary,
Bruch said. It is a necessary
part of attracting speakers, he
added. He said he believed Con-
tact got its money’s worth out of

“It sounds like you people got
your money’s worth,”’ Goddard
said in reference to the dinner.
The purpose of Contact is to br-
ing in speakers, not give din-

the dinners by saying that he
‘inherited past practices’ and
perpetuated those practices.

In regard to the funds Contact
kept in its account over the
summer, Bruch said “I
understood they were to remain
with Contact.’’ He said he was
not familiar with the student
constitution’s stipulation that
all unused money be returned to
the Central Student Body Fund.

Parties:

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, NOVEMBER 17, 1977

EC requires accountability

-by Lee Howard

In order, as Rick Goddard
said, to ‘‘tell the student com-
munity what’s going on” the
Executive Committee voted 6-4
to require committee co-
chairmen to ask the EC,s ap-
proval of parties before they
can take place.

Also, it appears that at next
week’s EC meeting, the EC will
vote to take away approximate-
ly half of the funds which re-
mained in the Contact account
during the summer and were
unreported at the budget hear-
ings in September.

Originally, the party vote had
been tied 4-4-2. But one of the
abstainers, EC president Jim
Underhill, then asked the EC
what the reaction of: students
toward parties is. EC vice presi-

Contac ’78

dent George Griffin responded
that many students were
outraged not so much at the
idea of student organizations
having parties as at the idea
that these parties are covered
up by the members of the stu-
dent organizations. He said he
talked to one senior who said
nothing made him madder in
his years at Washington and
Lee than the fact that Contact
had a $115 dinner, partially us-
ing student funds, without
anybody knowing about it.
Griffin said his motion did not
preclude organizations from
having parties, it only made
sure that such parties are
brought out into the open so
students know how their money
is being spent. ‘Personally, I’m
in favor of parties,” Griffin

Kunstler to speak

Contact ‘78 presents William
M. Kunstler, author, educator,
and noted defense attorney for
such personalties as the Ber-
rigan Broghers, H. Rap Brown,
the Attica inmates, the Chicago
7, and Stokely Carmichael.
Kunstler will speak in Lee
Chapel on Thursday, December
1, beginning at 8 p.m.

A man who revels in defen-
ding radicals and underdogs
alike, Kunstler has also been a
distinguished negotiator,
representing the Attica inmates
during the Attica prison
rebellion in September of 1971
and serving as intermediary for
the Mohawk Indians in their
land claim proceeding between
October and November of 1974.

Born in New York City in
1919, Kunstler received a
bachelor of arts degree from
Yale University in 1941. After a
distinguished career in the
United States Army, where he
attained the rank of major and
won the bronze star, Kunstler
attended Columbia Law school,
receiving his degree in 1948. A
year later he became a partner
in the law firm of Kunstler,
Kunstler, Human and Goldberg
in New York. He is currently
head of the Center for Constitu-
tional Rights.

While teaching at various
schools including Columbia
University, New York Law
School, Pace College, and the
New School for Social
Research, Kunstler found time
to write nine books, the last
published in 1966 entitled “‘Deep
in My Heart.” He has written
numerous articles and book
reviews appearing in the Col-
umbia Law Review, Life
Magazine, Rolling Stone, and

the Los Angeles Free Press.

Gaining fame through con-
troversy, Kunstler has received
many awards ranging from Phi
Beta Kappa to the Civil Rights
Award given by the New York
State Bar Association.

Kunstler is a member of
several prominent organiza-
tions including the American
Civil Liberties Union, National
Lawyers Guild, Attica Brothers
Defense League and the United
Prisoners’ Union.

said. He encouraged organiza-
tions such as the Ring-tum Phi
which don’t have parties to
have them. But he said he saw
no reason why students
shouldn’t have an opportunity
to protest the amount spent on
parties.

Griffin’s argument persuaded
the two abstainers, Underhill
and Steve Abraham to vote for
EC approval of parties. Jack
Bovay, Chris Gammon, God-
dard and Griffin also voted for
the proposal. Mike Missal,
Doug Perkins, Jim Davis and
Andy Bodenstab voted against
the proposal. (

The most active opponent of
Griffin’s motion was Missal,
who warned, “‘We’re getting too
overbearing on committees.”
He said the EC has given co-
chairmen responsibilities for
funds and should trust them to
use them properly.

Underhill, at first seeming to
be an opponent of the motion,
said the accounting guidelines,
combined with the oversight by
EC ad hoc members to various
committees should be enough to
ensure against misuse of stu-
dent funds. However, he seem-
ed convinced by Griffin’s argu-
ment that “Looking at the
receipts is after the fact.”’

In this same vein, but before
the EC had voted to make EC
approval of parties necessary,
Contact co-chairman Billy
Webster had said, ‘‘If we decide
to have one (a party), you’ll
know about it,”’ to which God-

Howard Nemerov came to
Washington and Lee, read
selected works and conquered
his audience Tuesday night with
a performance that while long,
revealed the brilliance of his
writing.

The secret of enjoying
Nemerov is simple: as he ex-
plained it, ‘“You have to be nuts
and on my wavelength.” And
during the course of his lecture,
as he “‘stood on (his) hind legs
looking like brown toast”’ in his
burnt orange suit, the audience
was invited to tune into
Nemerov’s frequency.

Nemerov is a master at con-
verting everyday experiences
or simple words into poetry. As
he puts it, “I like poems that
you don’t have to do any fancy
writing, but write what you
have learned about.’’ He admit-

 

[ted his poems are not like,

“You have to be nuts
and on my wave lengt

modern poetry ‘‘because you
don’t have to explain a lot.”

Within his poems is evidenced
a fascination for: bugs—‘‘I sup-
pose if I write an anthology, it
would be called ‘Bugs.’”’;
nature, especially the fall
season; and simple instruments
such as record players.

The simplicity of his writing
is what makes Nemerov’s
works so endearing, such as
describing a record player tone
arm as a traveller who does
nothing while the road goes on,
or describing autumn as the
back side of a tapestry.

Nemerov professes an affini-
ty for the late poet Robert
Frost, with whom he shared
‘sympathetic vibrations.’’
Perhaps the two are, as he call-
ed it, both ‘‘misanthropes’’ but
the joy of Nemerov is the sim-
ple, almost childlike way in
which he sees and describes the
world.

Phi could lose ad money;

editor, business mgr.

dispute

The Ring-tum Phi stands to
lose more than $1,900 in adver-
tising revenue over the rest of
the school year because of a
comment made in the Phi’s
gossip column, “The Nose
Knows,” which disparaged the
quality of clothes sold in Adair-
Hutton, Phi business manager
Pete Goss said at a Publications
Board meeting Monday.

Since the comment appeared
in the Oct. 27 issue Adair-Hutton
has not advertised, despite the
fact that the clothing store’s
manager, Leroy Worley, said
he planned to advertise in every
issue, Goss said. He added that
he had been told by Worley that
the reason Adair-Hutton
withdrew its advertising was
because of the comment made
in the ‘“‘Nose Knows” column.
He said that other clothing
stores had also been reluctant
to advertise since the column
appeared.

Goss, who requested the Mon-
day afternoon meeting, said
that in the seven weeks Adair-
Hutton advertised with the
newspaper it had given the Phi
$578 in revenue. Projecting
from that, he said that the Phi
could lose more than $1,900 if
Adair-Hutton decides not to
advertise the rest of the year.

Phi editor, Mike Gallagher,
admitted allowing the column’s
reference into the newspaper
was “a stupid mistake.’”’ He
said, however, that running a
college newspaper is a learning
process.

Goss replied, ‘‘While you’re
learning, we’re losing advertis-
ing revenue.”’

Other Publications Board

members said that not offen-
ding advertisers is just common

. sense. Grant Leister, Calyx

business manager said, ‘‘That’s
capitalism.’’ ‘“‘Every
newspaperman knows you don’t
print bad things about adver-
tisers,” Calyx editor Temp
Webber said.

Total advertising has dropped
off by about 50 per cent since
the Parents Weekend edition,
Goss said. He said it’s normal
for advertising to drop off
following the Parents Weekend
edition, but not by so much.

Gallagher later pointed out
that last year the paper’s adver-
tising revenue between Parents
Weekend and Dec. 2 also drop-
ped off by 50 per cent.

Gallagher suggested to Goss
that the business manager has
not explored all avenues for
advertisements. He said that
the ROTC department, for in-
stance, has only run one adver-
tisement all year, despite the
fact that it ran ads almost every
week last year. ROTC depart-
ment head, Maj. Adams, has
not even been contacted about
ads since the first week, when
the department ran a full page
advertisement, Gallagher said.

Goss responded that adver-
tisement revenue has been up
significantly this year, and he
has been busy developing na-
tional advertising sources.

Because of the recent un-
foreseeable cut in advertising
revenue as well as higher than
calculated costs for producing
the Phi, Goss asked the Publica-
tions Board to give him more
authority to regulate the size of

dard replied, ‘I hope we know
about it before you have it.”

Co-chairmen Webster and
Walter Granruth told the EC
that more than $800 remained in
three Contact accounts during
the summer. In Contact’s two
accounts at United Virginia
Bank were $466.98, Granruth
said. Additionally, the ¢co-
chairmen found out on the day
of Monday’s EC hearing that
$357.20 was left in Contact’s ac-
count with the university.

Granruth said “It’s kind of
astonishing to me’’ how it got
there. He said that until Mon-
day afternoon he didn’t know
there was any money in the ac-
count. He said that John Bruch,
the past year’s co-chairman
had told him sometime in May
that no money was left in the
university Contact account.

Granruth said Contact needed
money during the summer to
pay for expenses. He said ex-
penses over the summer were
about $285, including $269 which
had to be paid for travel ex-
penses for Vincent Bugliosi, a
Contact speaker. The remain-
ing money went for printing,
telephone and postage ex-
penses, he said.

As to why Contact had not in-
formed the EC of the amount re-

' maining in the Contact account,

Webster said ‘We _ honestly
didn’t think of it.”” He said, “‘It
didn’t cross either of our
minds’’ to include it as possible
revenues. The reason it never
occured to them, said Webster,
was that the two previous Con-
tacts had not included it as part
of revenues.

Griffin denied this, saying
that Bill Flesher and Mike
Monahan, co-chairmen two
years ago, did include their
“reserve fund’ as part of
revenues. Last year only a
nominal sum was left, Griffin
said. Webster said it was about
$80. Goddard said no student
organization should have such a
reserve fund. ‘‘Contact should
be treated the same way’’ as
other organizations, he said,
“any money left over should
revert tous.”

Underhill argued that ‘‘You’d
get a lot of opposition from the
IFC’’ if the EC tried to pass a
motion that would have all
money revert back to the EC
despite the fact the Inter
Fraternity Council gives Con-
tact nearly one third of its
funds.

Goddard then moved that
Contact,s money be split at the
end of the year on a percentage
between the EC and the IFC,

with the parent’s contributions
being split 50-50 between the
two organizations. This motion
was voted down 9-1. However,
another motion by Goddard
which would allow Contact to
keep the 15 per cent the parents
chip in, while the EC and the
IFC get their percentage passed
unanimously.

Following passage of this mo-
tion, Underhill said it stood to
reason that the EC get back its
share of the funds which re-
mained in the Contact account
during the past summer, par-
ticularly since Granruth told
the EC that it received a pledge
of $700 more from the IFC than
it had anticipated and had also
already exceeded anticipated
revenue from parents’ contribu-
tions by about $500. Contact’s
budget anticipated $3,300 from
the IFC and $1,700 from
parents.

Webster argued the cut,
which would amount to about
$400, ‘‘is going to inevitably af-
fect the number and quality of
speakers we produce.” He add-
ied, ‘‘We would not be able to put
‘on a good program.” Speaker
fees have gone way up since last
year, he said.

Underhill said he didn’t: ‘know
how Webster could say that,
particularly since he had
discovered just a few hours ago
$357 he didn’t even know he had.
Also, the extra money from the
IFC and parents came as a sur-
prise, he said.

Webster responded that he
thought assistant treasurer
Louis Snyder must have made a
mistake when he said Contact
had $357 in its university ac-
count. He therefore urged the
EC to table discussion of taking
away Contact funds until the ex-
act amount of money which re-
mained in the Contact account
is verified. The EC decided to
take up the issue next week.

The EC also decided to table
discussion of a motion by God-
dard that defendants in an
honor trial be presented with
copies of the physical evidence
against them. Goddard said the

- EC had to post notices that

discussion of revision of the
white book would occur at the
next EC meeting.

Goddard said the reason he
made his proposal is that, as it
stands now, a defendant can
call for a recess after he has
been presented with the
physical evidence against him.
Why not just give the defendant
the physical evidence against
him prior to a hearing so he can
present his case, Goddard said.

Wind Quintet Performs Today’

by Robert Tremblay

Tonight at 8 o'clock the
Clarion Wind Quintet will per-
form in Lee Chapel.

A solid group of professionals,
the Clarion Wind Quintet has
been performing together for 16
years. From North America to
Europe and to Latin America,
they have been well received.
Each member of the group is an
artist-in-residence at the North
Carolina School of the Arts in
Winston-Salem. In the past,
each instrumentalist has held a
first chair position in major
symphony and chamber or-
chestras as well as journeying
on successful solo careers.

The members of the group
are: Philip Dunigan, flute;
Robert Listokin, clarinet;
Joseph Robinson, oboe; Mark
Popkin, bassoon; and
Frederick Bergstone, horn. If
you wish to purchase any of
their recordings, the quintet ap-
pears on Golden Crest and
Educo Records.

Their concert includes the
music of Ibert, Brahms,
Stewart, Klughardt, and
Hindemith. Jacques Ibert is a
20th century French composer,
but his music is more of a throw
back to the late, Romantics and
the Impressionists than to the
atonality of our age. His Three
Short Pieces will be very
French sounding with smatter-
ings of Debussy and Poulenc ap-
parent throughout. Brahms is,
of course, one of the greatest
composers in the history of
music. He is a late Romantic,

but his music displays” a
classical control and balance
more in tune with Beethbyen
than with Liszt. His Variations
and Fugue on a Theme _ b
Handel, originally writte for

piano, will be arran for

group’s bassoonist; | Mark

Popkin. Handel only’ wrote five
variations on this theme, but
Brahms, ever the musical. in-
tellectual, wrote 25, and tops! it
off with a very werful fugue at
the end.

Robert Stewart is professor of
music at Washington and Lee as
well:as a noted composer and
conductor. His Five Visions is a
serial; composition based on a
twelve tone row. The work
dates back to 1960. August
Klughardt is a late Romantic,

but unlike Brahms, I believe
Klughardt’s Quintet op. 79 will
be a piece of displaying more of
a Wagnerian influence. The
final piece on_ the
program,Kleine Kammermusik
(a “Little Chamber Music’’), is
by Paul Hindemith, one of the
giants in 20th century music.
Hindemith, though a bold in-
novator, still had a deep love for
the classical ‘and romantic
styles. This work, a_ true
masterpeicé, should exemplify
both trends, as well as
Hindemith’s own distinct and
personal touch. In the second
movement, by the way, a pic-
colo should replace the flute.

This concert, which, hopeful-
ly, will be well attended, is
sponsored by the Washington
and Lee Concert Guild.

ENTERTAINMENT

UT Presents
The Beaux’ Strategem

 

 

 

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor

The University Theatre will
soon present its second play of
the major season, when George
Farquhar’s The Beaux’
Strategem opens Wednesday,
November 30—playing through
Sunday, December 4, directed
by Dr. Al Gordon.

The comedy is part of a
glorious period in English
drama. It dates to 1660, and the
return of the monarchy in the
form of colorful, fun-loving
Charles II. Thirty years of age
and a great lover of the arts, the
bachelor king had a joie de
vivre which went beyond the
bounds of decorum for the usual
British king. But after 18 years
of Puritan restraint, Charles’
escapades were not only
tolerated, but applauded by a
suddenly giddy populace.

This mating of interests—
open views of sex, a craving for
bright wit and repartee, a

‘ cynical attitude toward most of
what is sacred in life—spawned
Restoration comedy. The flood
of interest carried on even after
the death of Charles in 1685; a
“second generation” of writers
emerged to carry on the

‘comedy of manners”’ tradition
of well-ordered lust which the
old king would have loved best.
Among these was Farquhar,
whose career began in the
1690’s.

A great favorite at court, Far-
quhar’s comedies were great
successes for the time;
remember, the theatre-going
public of the time was quite
small, and a run of ten days was
considered phenomenal! In
fact, Farquhar set a length
record, when his play The Cons-
tant Couple ran at Drury Lane
for 53 nights in the 1699-1700
season.

The Beaux’ Strategem comes
at the close of the writer’s
career. Aging and worn out,
Farquhar wrote the comedy for
six weeks on his deathbed, in
1707. As one critic later noted,
“He lived just long enough to
receive the profits from the
third performance (which was
the author’s benefit night), and
to know that its character of
Lady Bountiful had provided
the language with a perfect
synonym for ostentatious chari-
ty.”

The story line of Beaux’
Strategem is a typical one for

the period—a healthy mixture
of romance, adventure, and
cynical comedy. Two Restora-
tion dandies, Aimwell and Ar-
cher (played in the W&L
rpoduction by Chip Hughes and
Taylor Harbison) arrive in the
country from London, scheming
to marry money. Through
various devices, they meet
Lady Bountiful, an _ old
noblewoman, her daughter
Dorinda, and her unhappily-
married daughter-in-law Mrs.
Sullen. A series of romantic in-
trigues develops, but as direc-

Musical Mainstream

by Mark Mainwaring

There’s little doubt that the
Doobie Brothers are one of the
best commercial and singles-
oriented bands around. Judging
by their performance last Sun-
day at the Roanoke Civic
Center, they’re a surprisingly
good live act as well. The group
opened with one of their best-
known songs, ‘China Grove,”
and moved neatly into ‘‘Takin’
it to the Streets.”” From there,
the Doobies proceeded to play
virtually all their hits
(including ‘“‘Long Train Runn-
ing’,” “Black Water,” ‘‘Listen
to the Music’”’ and others), plus
a number or two from their new
album, Living on the Fault
Line. The band was extremely
tight, and its members (not to
mention the crowd) were quite
obviously enjoying themselves.

The real surprize at this
show, though, was the opening
set by Pablo Cruise. With
several extended (but not

monotonous) — instrumental
jams by guitarists Dave
Jenkins and Bud Cockrell, plus
excellent keyboard work from
Cory Lerios, the band’s
members showed that there’s
more to them than just their re-
cent hit single ‘“‘Watcha Gonna
Do.” According to Jenkins, the
success of that song was not a
complete surprise. ‘‘I know it.
was good, because it had a real
strong groove to it, and in-
teresting hooks all the way
through,’’ he said. He also add-
ed, half jokingly, that “the
words were dumb enough to get
across to the people.’’ With con-
siderable pressure on the band
after the commercial success a
A Place in the Sun, it will be in-
teresting to see what Pablo
Cruise comes up with next. Says
guitarist Jenkins, ‘‘All we have
to do is just keep playing our
music. If the next record
doesn’t do as well commercial-
ly, who cares?”

earnings have taken 20th-Fox’s

thoughts of huge growth instead
of bankruptcy. Beyond a
shadow of a doubt, Star Wars

ing film of all -time by

No one has ever really
dissected the reasons for this
success. It is common
knowledge in the movie world
that writer-director George
Lucas (of American Graffitti
fame) intended the film to be
solely “‘B”’ quality, making ‘‘B’’
profits. He gave (persuaded? )
Alec Guiness the great old sage,
the future freer of the soul. Deb-
bie Reynolds’ daughter, Carrie
Fisher, was handed the part of
your , basic  beautiful(?),
spunky, liberated princess, and
Mark Hamill was the lucky
recipient of the part of Luke—
every young girl’s heart-throb
hero.

But why such success?

Shakespeare in Dec.

by Galen Trussell

The Student Activities Board
has announced that the Na-
tional Shakespeare Company
will perform ‘‘As You Like It’’
here at Washington and Lee on
December 5.

The SAB decided to bring
the Natinal Shakespeare
Company to Washington and
Lee for the Sunday night per-
formance at its regular meeting
Sunday night. The date for the
performance will not be con-
crete until the final contract is
resolved. The SAB also decided
to hold the play in the gym and
selected a 7:30 curtain time for
the performance.

SAB co-chairman Bill Tucker
said he would like to see the per-
formance be free of charge to
all students and faculty. The
price for the act will cost ap-
proximately $2,000, which will
be absorbed by the SAB’s
general entertainment fund.

Like It’’ over ‘“‘The Winter’s
Tale’ and ‘‘Othello” because
members believed the W&L
community would enjoy a com-
edy more than the other two
choices.

The National Shakespeare
Company visited W&L in
January of 1974 and presented
‘As You Like It’’ then also. The
1974 performance of the play
cost students $2 for admission
and drew a large crowd. The
play was presented in a two act
format with the comedy scenes
exaggerated to a hilarious ex-
tent.

The play itself centers on the
confusion involved in love. The
heroine Rosalind disguises
herself as a man so as to be able
to observe her lover. The result
of her disguise wins the affec-
tion of another girl. As the ac-
tion continues not only are the
roles of the sexes reversed but
the fortunes of the characters

Soccer Team
Regains Pride

by Chris Fay

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team ended the season on a
positive note last Friday. The
Generals beat the University of
North Carolina—Greensboro by
a score of 3 to 1. The Generals,
by winning their last game,
broke their losing streak of
eight games.

Head soccer coach Rolf Pira-
nian said, “I believe it takes a
coach three years to field a
team he wants.”’ The team has
improved the two years Pira-
nian has been coach and he ex-
pects it to improve more next
year. Although several fine

players are leaving this year,
Piranian believes that there
will be little difficulty in fielding
another good team next year.
The soccer players on the varsi-
ty team have improved and
there are several players on
this year’s JV squad who should
be able to move up and fill the
gaps.

However, Piranian also siad,
“I'd be lying if I said I was com-
pletely satisfied’ with this
year’s season. The team lost
four games by one goal. Pira-
nian believes that it wasn’t lack
of effort by the team but too
many bad breaks which caused
some of the disappointment.

Generals Lose Second
Battle of Gettysburg

by Pete Abitante

Behind an offense that rolled
up 427 total yards, Gettysburg
College had little trouble get-
ting by the Generals 28-6 last
Saturday in Gettysburg. While
the Bullet were rolling along,
the Generals could muster only
one first down and 36 yards total
offense in the first half, a pro-
phesy of their doom.

Two instances significantly
limited W&L’s quest to upset
Gettysburg for the second year
in a row. First, senior quarter-
back Ted Hissey, already nurs-
ing a sore shoulder, left the
game on the Generals’ second
possession of the game with an
injured arm. With his departure
went the leadership and passing
attack that has directed many
W&L drives this year.

The second incident, which
may have been the turning
point of the game, came with
less than a minute to play in the
half. W&L was in punt forma-
tion when punter Syd Farrar
bobbled the snap from center
and was forced to run, getting
as far as the General 38—not
enough for the first down. On

Hungry Wrestlers Ready To
Defend ODAC Crown

by Mark Peterson

Poor draws and early season
jitters resulted in a disappoin-
ting start for the wrestling
Generals in the recent Monarch
Open held at ODU on November
11 and 12. Only tri-captain
Howdy Knipp (126) got past his
first round opponent, although
sophomore Ray Gross (142) did
win a consolation match and the
entire team gained valuable
wrestling experience.

The tournament, open to 312
wrestlers, which is more than
are invited to the Division III
nationals, included such Divi-
sion I eastern powerhouses as
West Chester St., NC St., UNC,
William and Mary, and Lehigh.

Despite their slow start, the
hopes of the team are not at all
dampened as they prepare to
defend their ODAC crown. Led
by tri-captains Howdy Knipp
‘78, Ed Rodgers ‘79 and Dan
Kniffin ‘79, five other returning
lettermen and an impressive
array of veterans and
freshmen, the team is looking
forward to a second consecutive
ODAC championship, and im-
provement on last year’s 10-3
duel meet record and many im-
pressive victories in the six
tournaments entered this year.

The starting team, featuring
seven lettermen, two varstly
improved upperclassmen, and
one highly touted freshman,
promises to be one of the
strongest Washington and Lee
has fielded in many years.

Beginning his fourth year at
118 lbs. is senior tri-captain

year, and if early season

Tri-captain Ed Rodgers, a
junior, is one of the two return-
ing ODAC champions on the
Generals. He is moving up from
150 lbs. to 158 in hopes of mat-
ching last year’s excellent tour-
nament record while improving
on his dual meet record.

Kniffen, the third member of
the Generals captains’ club is
also changing weight class this
year moving down from
heavyweight to 190 Ibs.
Although he won’t join the team
until the end of football season,
he is being counted on to pro-
vide many victories this year.

the next play, Gettysburg
quarterback Bob LeComte
found halfback Dave Natale
streaking down the sideline for
a 38 yard scoring strike. Thus,
what looked like a 9-0 Get-
tysburg halftime lead quickly
turned out to be 15-0, with W&L
set to receive the second half
kickoff.

Gettysburg had scored its
first touchdown of the day at the
4:05 mark of the first quarter as
LeComte hit runningback Jim
Bixby with a 7 yard pass. The
conversion failed, but Rick Ep-
pleman kicked a 36 yard field
goal in the second quarter for
the 9-0 lead.

Freshman quarterback Chris
Leiser, the third General
quarterback of the day, started
the second half and led the team
on what turned out to be its only
touchdown of the afternoon.
Capitalizing on a fumbled Get-
tysburg punt return, Leiser

‘ drove the Generals 33 yards in
six plays, capping the drive
himself on a 12 yard run. Karl
Cheatham’s attempted two
point conversion run failed.

Theoretically, the Generals
were still in the game at this
point, but statistically they
were outclassed. The offense
could manage only 51 yards
rushing—24 of which Leiser
gained.

As to the passing attack,
quarterbacks Hissey, Swope,
and Leiser completed only 5 of
16 attempts for 79 yards. Three
of those passes were to flanker
Richie Wiles, good for 47 yards,
thus increasing his season total
to 36 receptions and 500 yards.

The only other bright spot of
the game was the play of cor-
nerback Jack Norberg, who ac-
counted for 114 yards on two
punt and four kickoff returns. In
addition, he blocked two kicks.

The defense had one of its
most dismal days ever, allow-

_ ing the Bullets an average of 5.1
yards per play and 278 yards on
the ground.

With the temperature dropp-
ing and the snow falling more

steadily, the game was placed
out of reach when Gettysburg
scored two fourth quarter
touchdowns—salting its third
win of the year, 28-6.

This Saturday, the Generals
close out their season against
former club team Georgetown
University. For seven seniors,
it will be their last game. Co-
captains Marc Duncan and Jeff
Slatcoff, a potential All-
American linebacker, quarter-
back Ted Hissey, halfback Ed
Johnson, tight end Bob
“Chooser’’ Szczecinski, split
end Bill Frear, and punter-
defensive back Phil Bailey will
all be playing their last game on
Wilson Field. It would be fitting
to go out with a win for these
seven, and to do that they will
have to beat a mediocre but
steadily improving Georgetown
team.

The Hoyas, coming off a 42-13
victory over Manhattan last
Saturday are now 2-6 on the
year. Their only other win was
against Galludet, while the best
competition they have faced
was Fordham who, while
beating Georgetown 40-0, lost
convincingly to Davidson.

The Generals annihilated the
Hoyas last year 43-12 at
Georgetown so they should be
ready for W&L. While a win
would not redeem the entire
season, for many, it would
mean a fond memory to reflect
on for years to come.

Cagers Shoot For 2nd ODAC Title

by Mark Mitchell

“We should have a better
team than last year’s even
though we probably won’t have
as good a record,” says head
basketball coach Verne Can-
field.

A daring statement coming
from a man who has lost five
players to graduation, including
the two best rebounders and
three of the top four scorers
from last year’s team.

There are reasons for op-
timism, however. All three
returning starters are
acknowledged to be excellent
players and all three have im-
proved. The most noticeable
player will be senior guard and
super shooter (57.4 per cent
from the field last year) Pat
Dennis. Dennis moves very well
without the ball, can post, as
well as launch rockets from 30
feet, and is an excellent offen-
sive rebounder. He has been
working on his stamina so that
he will be able to play more
minutes this year. By playing
more minutes, he will be able to
put up even more than the 478
shots (220 more than any other
returning player) that he put up
last year. His defense has also
improved. Although he will still
have trouble once his man gets
the ball, he helps out well on
defense and plays good zone
defense.

Although Dennis may be the
most noticeable player on the
team, junior Dave Leunig will
probably be the most valuable.
He is a player who gives 110 per
cent and he has improved every
year. One statistical indication
of his improvement is that his
shooting percentage last year
was ten points higher than in his
freshman year. He will be
valuable, not only because he is
the Generals’ best all-around
player, but also because he is
the most versatile player,
capable of playing all three
front line positions. On defense,
he will usually cover the other
team’s best forward. He re-
bounds, shoots, defends and
passes excellently. Un-
fortunately, he also fouls—
leading the team in fouls and
disqualifications last year.

At point guard, junior Mike
Wenke, who has set several
W&L assist records, returns.
This year, however, oppoents
will have to guard more than his
passes. Last year, Wenke took
half as many shots as any other

get double figure scoring from

result will be more shooting and

suited for this job as Canfield
has claimed that Ardith has the
potential to be the best defen-
sive rever coached.

However, Coach Canfield
usually uses eight to ten players
a game so the performance of
the bench will have a great deal
to do with this year’s success.
Canfield is optimistic about the
bench, feeling that the team
“‘has potentially the best depth
we’ve ever had.”’ Well, maybe.

known only for his spectacular
lay ups, has been a pleasant
surprise. He has looked sensa-
tional in practice, using his
quickness to effectively keep
the ball away from his man. His
only problems seem to be defen-
sive rebounding (he seems to be
relying too much on his great
leaping ability rather than
establishing postion) and his
tendency to use up his dribble
prematurely or be caught up in
the air with no place to throw
the ball. These problems are
minor and correctable which
explains why this small forward
is the sixth man.

Point guard is another very
deep position. Senior co-captain
Bobby Forlenza, a former
starter who has proven himself
under fire, backs up Wenke.
Forlenza has had such a good
pre-season that W&L’s point
guard of the future, Pete Far-
rell, a talented speedster who
can play, won’t.

Replacing Dennis at shooting
guard is perhaps W&L’s most
physically talented player—
Thomas Jeffries (T.J.). T.J. is
quick and can sky. In the past
weeks, he has made great pro-
gress in playing the ball-denial,
helping defense that the
Generals play. However, he has
two counts against him. His
natural position is not shooting
guard, but forward, and he is
having to change his one-on-one
style to conform to Canfiled’s
more restricted style. Never-
theless, he has the potential to
be an awesome defensive
player, quick enough to deny his
man the ball, and a good enough
leaper to block shots when he
helps out.

Presently, he is doing well
enough to keep freshman Karby
Hoy, the leading scorer in
Delaware last year, behind
him. At strong forward, big,
(6’5”’, 205 Ibs.) physical Jim
Berlin replaces Larry Meyer.
Although not a scorer, Berlin
rebounds well at both ends of
the floor, sets a mean screen,
passes well and helps out on

defense. He only needs to front
his man more on defense, and
he has shown improvement in
this area.

Depth at center is the area in
which there were the most wor-
ries earlier this year. Two of the
team’s three centers graduated
last year and the one that re-
mained was very prone to foul-
ing. Help came from unex-
pected spots—Chris Ware, a
sophomore who did not try out
last year and Bob Smitherman
(‘String’), a freshman. They
are an interesting pair—Chris is
shorter, but very strong, Bob is
not strong, but is 6’7’’, with very
long arms. Neither has had the
year of training necessary to be
fundamentally solid, but they
both work hard. Their con-
tinued development will be im-
portant to the team’s success.

The offense differs from last
year’s. The ball is being moved
up the floor more quickly in
order to initiate the ‘‘early of-
fense,’’ if the opponent’s
defense is not set. This is not to
imply that the Generals are
running-and-gunning or being
more careless with the ball. The
team is as conscious of avoiding
turnovers on offense as it is of
forcing turnovers on defense.
When a team shoots 50.2 per
cent from the floor as the
Generals did last year, the team
wants to get a shot off on every
possession. Thus, the early of-
fense is really a set play. It
should capitalize on the fact
that Collins will usually beat his
man up the court. Most of the
time, however, the defense will
be set and the Generals will call
a play.

The main difference in the
plays this year is that the center
has been moved up high, free-
ing the area under the basket
for quick posts and flash pivots
by Meyer, Dennis, Leunig,
Williams, and T.J., all of whom
are very effective scorers and
rebounders down low. The point
guard is also presented with
more scoring opportunities this

In three class days the doors of this fine institution

The only problem, or perhaps it is a blessing, is
‘“‘Juliets” rarely become ‘rack dates” (a mere
substitution of ‘‘car’’ for “rack” can be made, but
something gets lost in the translation).

Mom and Dad will be waiting at the front door with
a piece of cheese cake in their hands. The house will
be warm; the food will be good; the beds will be made
and clean. Spot will wag his tail the whole time you
are home and Sis will expertly apply back massage
after back massage. The atmosphere will be perfect
for some catch up studying, though it is doubtful any
will be done.

The dreams of hometown parties which have been
occuring in heads since September will finally come
true. For many, old friendships will appear just
that—old. But for others, Thanksgiving presents the
opportunity to see friends who have meant so much,
to relive old times, and become melacholy over
several emptied pitchers. (For those to the left, the
past will be melancholically remembered over a new
batch of ‘“‘home-grown.”’)

Besides an escape from the books, Thanksgiving
provides the means of escape from other things. The
members of Contact, the E.C., and'S.A.B. can escape
from the spotlight in which they have found
themselves this year. The football team can escape
from a very bad showing and season. The SAF’s can
escape the blowings of the ‘“‘Nose.” The ‘pseudo
preps’’ can take off their khakis and alligator belts.
The Lexington police can put their pens and pads
down for a week. Dan Beyer can go back to Albion.
And the Ring-tum Phi editorial staff can take a vaca-
tion from all the flack that seems to be fired at them
from everywhere. Life is so simple.

Have a good Thanksgiving holiday.

EC Member
Clarifies Stand

To the Editor:

As its November 7 meeting.
the Executive Committee refus-
ed to formally declare that
spending student money for
parties or dinners without prior
EC approval always constitutes
an honor violation. This ap-
parent retreat from respon-
sibility should not’ be
misunderstood by chairmen
and treasurers of organizations
receiving student monies. The
EC allocates money each year
to student groups which have
made specific proposals as to
the use of those funds, proposals
designed to benefit the entire
student body. The Committee
entrusts money to the chairmen
and treasurers with the direc-
tive that the funds’ be used for
the stated purposes only. Strict
accounting guidelines adopted
this year and applied to every
student organization will enable
the EC to monitor all spending.
The Committee will not tolerate
spending for purposes other
than those authorized, and
chairmen and treasurers know
that they will be held personally
responsible for any unauthoriz-
ed or improper spending.

Mr. John Bruch and others
will be unhappy with this policy.
Bruch fails to realize that the
EC is not bound to give Contact
or any other organization any
student money. Last year, the
EC provided 53 per cent of Con-
tact’s total budget. If Contact or
any other group accepts student
money, it takes the funds with
all responsibilities imposed by
the EC. If Bruch or any other
student cannot deal with those
responsibilities, he need not ac-
cept the money. Bruch has
argued that a past practice of
Contact was to hold a party or
dinner for its members
‘“‘because we deserved it.’ This
practice of spending with im-
punity is at an end. Students
who claim the right to spend
student funds on themselves ‘‘at
our discretion’’ have no place in
student financial affairs. Those

who act on that “right’’ in the
future will not be tolerated in
the W&L community.

Remodeled
Co-op disliked

Dear Editor:

I am surprised that the
“remodeling” of the Co-op has
gone unprotested. I find the
changes to be haphazard and
whimsical. Talking with fellow
students confirms my observa-
tions. And rather than list all of
the changes that have
depreciated the quality of the
Co-op, I will name only several
of the major ones.

First, the claim that there has
not been. a decrease in the
seating area is a blatant lie. The
change has made the Co-op a
less attractive place to visit.
And I think I can judge because
I believe, have spent more time
in there than Mr. Darrell ever
will. Second, changing the style
of service and reducing the
variety of food has made me
search elsewhere for more
palatable snacks. I cannot even
get a coke. When I questioned
Mr. Darrell on this point, he
cited limited space and further
said it was his choice. I suggest
his choice was arbitrary and
capricious. Further, a good
breakfast of eggs or a cup of
coffee that is not in a styrofoam
cup can no longer be bought.
Also, the cafeteria style does
not expedite service; we still
have to wait to pay for food. The
bottlenecks have not been
eliminated, just moved. Third,
the change in the supply store
hours have only inconvenienced
us. And further to accuse the
students of stealing $10,000
seems irrational if we are
honorable men. How much of
that was due to poor bookkeep-
ing? In addition, there are no
magazines, and I would suggest
that volume is down because we
students are extremely _in-
convenienced and cannot pur-
chase needed school supplies at

certain psychological value in
purchasing an exam book the
night before a test rather than
to have to rush in early the next

While there may have been a
need for change, the new
management appears to be
more incompetent than ever.
Reduced variety, shorter hours,
and diminished quality all
mean the students got the short
end of the deal when the Co-op
was reorganized. Yet aren’t we

Another

puritan

Dear Editor:

In regard to your last week’s
issue, I was simply appalled by
the sexual implications that ap-
peared in the article ‘“Traveler
from Altruria.’’ The _pro-
miscuous and unhealthy allu-
sions made in this article were
positively revolting and don’t
belong in any newspaper pur-
porting to deal with news and
not with this sinful trash. The
very idea of a grown man tak-
ing advantage of a drunk
woman and removing her
clothes (and actually throwing
them out the window) for sexual
intentions is unheard of where I
come from and I can tell you
right now that no respectable
W&L gentleman has_ even
thought of this idea let alone
perform this heinous act. The
poor girl was a victim of a
diseased mind who had no con-
ception of love whatsoever, but
only of raw, unadulterated, and
unholy sex! This sickness does
not belong in a newspaper, but
in the fires of hell and I am
writing to you to protest so that
this filth is not seen again. By
the way, the other reason I’m
writing to you is that if this
forementioned girl wants her
clothes back, I’ll be happy to
return them to her, but I’m
keeping her bra and panties.

Prudently yours,
Jay Korn

 
Play opens after Thanksgiving

(continued from page 3)
tor Gordon points out, “The
plot, though it may have been
complicated, was rarely the
pivotal facet of these comedies.
Rather, the plot was used to
support funny characters,

brilliant one-liners, and farcial -

situations.”’
Filled with unforgetable.

characters—heroes and villains
alike—the play ends in
characteristically happy
fashion. True love previals and
the villains are foiled—and all
are a little wiser in the ways of
human folly. It is truly ‘‘an ex-
uberant, lusty, refreshing
piece.”’

In speaking aobut his play,
Dr. Gordon commented, ‘‘It is a
show perfect for the
Troubadour facility, an_ in-
timate playhouse certainly
‘reminiscent of the theatres of
the day. We have taken this
basic advantage, and have add-
ed as many ‘extrag’ as possible,
in order to datch'the flavor of
the 18th century.There will be
songs at intermission’ with
orange-girls paddling their
wares, as was done in the real
theatres. And, we are even
planting our’ owfi’ ‘audience’ in
the sideboxes. They will not on-
ly react to the ‘play in typical
fashion, but willcarry on a few
intrigues of their own...”

UT fans will also be in-
terested to note ‘the return of
Dr. Shillington to the boards, as
the innkeeper Boniface, after
his show-stopping appearance
in Uncle Vanya last season.
And, as a special added attrac-
tion, the head of the drama
department himself, Prof. Lee
Kahn, will be returning trium-
phantly to the stage after a
twenty-year sabbatical, to play
the ‘‘dirty old man in the upper
box.”

It seems as though the watch-
cry of this play is going to be
“‘fun.’”’ If you are bored by the
sighing Russians of Chekhov, or
disgusted by the blasphemies of
Albee, this breezy comedy is
probably the show to
see...Beaux’ Strategem is a
perfect example of the so-called
“transition play.’’ Stanind mid-
way as it does between the
cynical attitudes of the Restora-
tion, and the pious sentiment
which was soon to follow in the
later 1700’s, the comedy is a

With time running out in the
fourth year, graduation seemed
a long shot for the Barrel. It was
thought hopeless just three
weeks ago, compounded by no
muscle tone, sneakers too big,
and an athletic prowess match-
ed by Gerald Ford. But with the
aid of Coach Abby and Trainer
Strange, Barrel turned in a
11:36 six lap performance as
sizzling as a T-bone.

Lord McMillan of the Rhodes
Scholarship Committee called it
‘‘a most amazing athletic
achievement.’”’ Similarly, the
parents of the ‘rotund wonder,’
who thought their $20,000 invest-
ment was down the drain, com-
mented, ‘‘can you believe this
kid!.....0h, I wish I would have
been there.”’

Most relieved of all though
was Barrel’s flaming wonder,
who said, ‘‘aw, aw, aw.”’

When seeing Star Wars, you
. must release yourself to a
regression in your
psychological attitudes. The
heroes that you have been told
no longer exist must be able to
re-enter your thought process.
You must be free to stare in awe
and let emotions ride on fan-'
tasy. In short, you must let
yourself become a kid again.

After the outset, this becomes
very easy. The special effects
capture and hypnotize easily.
Perhaps this is because the
special effects are actually real
within the context of the presen-
tation (which can be ex-
emplified by the realization that
there actually exists old space
ships). What Star Wars does is
capture the imagination. You
know what the ending will be a
half-hour ahead of time, but
you're captive anyway.

In sum, you will find most of
those who found the rest of the
movie as poor as I found the
first five minutes are either (1)
40 years older’ than their
chronological age, or (2) over 40
and ulcer infested. Star Wars is
a fantasy. Fantasies are for the
young.

It’s to America’s credit that
most of its people are still young
enough to fantasize.

previous week he had only

when he_ requested that
Gallagher only put out an eight

Lee Howard, news editor of

had been rebuffed was that he
had waited until the last minute
to tell the news staff that a 12
page paper was economically
unfeasible. By that time stories
had already been written, and
there were a good 12 pages of

reporters had spent a lot of time

might lose the enthusiasm of its
reporters.

Gallagher went on to em-

pages every week, and that it’s
up to the business manager to
find enough advertising to pay
for the paper. He said that Goss

staff was frequently hitting the
maximum figure which the
business manager of the News-
Gazette, E. S. Humphreys,
quoted to him for production of
the paper. He said that is
because there is too much copy
and not enough pictures and
advertisements. The latter cost
less to produce, he said.

Gallagher said the news staff
is getting its copy in on time and
there hasn’t been any overtime
pay since the second issue; he
suggested that Goss go down
and talk to Humphreys.

It was decided by the board
that Goss and Gallagher go to
see Humphreys together. It was
also decided that Goss and
Gallagher get together every
Friday night at 5 o’clock to
decide what size the paper is go-
ing to be. This will give the news
staff plenty of warning as to
how many stories to assign,
Ryland Owen, president of the

Owen said it was ‘“‘embarass-

year.

At the other end of the floor,
the Generals will again use six
different defenses. This year,
like last year, the primary
defense will be pressure man-
to’’man. Although they will pro-
bably play more zones this
year, the main difference is that
they plan to execute their
man’’to-man defense hetter this
year.

They must force more tur-
novers and disrupt opposing of-
fenses more. if they are to be as
good a team as last year’s.
There are two main reasons for
this argument: it is doubtful
that they can equal last year’s
record 50.2 per cent field goal
percentage and record free
throw percentage, after losing
three people who were in-
strumental in setting those
records. And last year, they out-
rebounded their opponents by a
record margin. This year, miss-
ing their two best rebounders,
the rebounding, especially
defensively, is a question mark.

However, it remains to be seen «
whether the better weak side |

defense, which is so necessary

for improving the defense will

_ materialize.

Fortunately, the team has un-
til late February to put it all
together. If past history is any
indication, a 40 per cent winning
percentage will get a team into
the ODAC tournament. Once in
the tournament, a team has on-
ly to win two games to get into
the ODAC tournament, and if
this unified, hard-working team
continues to improve (and there
is no reason to believe that it
will not), the team could get in-
to the NCAA _fournament.

Rtp challenges policy;

 

NUMBER 11

Kirby denies access to public records Goddard

the Free Press Fair Trial J; challenged by the Ring-tum Phi

by Randolph P. Smith

Police Chief James A. Kirby,
in a recent interview, said that
his fear of libel action is one of
the primary reasons behind the
Lexington Police Department’s
policy of refusing to release the
names of persons arrested or
issued court summonses.

Kirby made the statement in
an effort to justify the Depart-
ment’s official policy of ‘“‘deny-
ing access” to the general
public and press information
relating to arrest records and
summonses until such time as
they have been entered on the
court record. The policy has
been formally challenged by the
Ring-tum Phi.

It is the contention of the

' Ring-tum Phi that Virginia’s

Freedom of Information Act re-
quires all arrest records: and
court summonses to be open for
inspection by the public and the
press immediately after an ar-
rest or execution of a summons.

J. Michael Gallagher, editor
of the Ring-tum Phi, said that
“immediate access should be
given to the name of the accus-
ed, his age, his residence, his
employment, family
backbround, and other brief
facutal background relative to
the charge.’’ Gallagher pointed
out that his position is very
similar to the one expressed in

W&L students

lose *3,000
to burgulars

by Heartsill Ragon

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity students have reported to
police that over $3,000 in stereo
and electronic equipment was
stolen from student apartments
over the Thanksgiving break.

One apartment’s larceny
report showed a total of $1,725
worth of equipment was lost to
burgulars.

According to Lexington police
chief J. A. Kirby, six student
housing . facilities reported
break-ins over the five-day holi-
day. Kirby said apartments at
108 Randolph St., 3 University
Place, and 302 S. Jefferson St.
reported thefts of stereo equip-
ment, television sets, clock

radios and a rifle.
In addition to break-ins at

these apartments, the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon and Phi Gamma
Delta fraternity houses
reported thefts to city police of-
ficials.

Also, one W&L student’s dor-
matory room was broken into.
Police report that the burgulars
apparently had access to a
spare key to that room.

(continued on page 9)

Voluntary Guidelines adopted
by the Virginia Bar Association
and Virginia Press Association.

Kirby explained that the
Police Department’s policy was
initiated by the former Chief, A.
E. Rhodenizer, in 1974. The
policy was formed out of the
Department’s interpretation of
the Privacy Protection Act of
1974. .

Although he did not initiate
the policy of withholding the
names of those arrested or
issued court summonses, Kirby
said he was in full support of the
policy. When the policy was

in connection with specific
police actions, Chief Kirby
sought legal assistance.

In a later interview, Kirby
said that City Attorney William
O. Roberts had told him that he

has the authority to withhold
the names of persons arrested
and circumstances surrounding
their arrest until such time as
they have been entered on the
court record. /

In a letter dated November
10, 1977, Roberts cited two
statutes as the legal justifica-
tion for the Police Depart-

ment’s policy. Roberts declared.

that the authority to withhold
the names of those arrested or
given summonses is included in
Virginia’s Freedom of Informa-
tion Act.

The expressed written intent
of the Freedom of Information
Act states that it was the pur-
pose of the General Assembly
“to ensure to the people of this
Commonwealth ready access to
records in the custody of public
officials.” The policy of the Act
further recognizes that ‘‘the af-
fiars of government are not in-
tended to be conducted in an at-
mosphere of secrecy since at all

No leads in Pika fire

by Ned McDonnell

Thus far, no arrests have
been made in connection with
last week’s smokebomb fire at
Pi Kappa Alpha.

The investigation team of a
Virginia state arson squad, the
Lexington Fire Department,
and the Police Department
have uncovered two suspects
says Fire Chief Charles Conner.
But Conner would make no fur-
ther comments or speculations
on the nine to fourteen thousand
dollars of estimated damage
wreaked on the fraternity house
by vandals. A check with other
fraternities revealed that three
others, Pi Kappa Phi, Sigma
Phi Epsilon and Kappa Alpha,
had similiar incidents the same
night.

The conflagration, discovered
by Pi Kappa Phi junior Chris
Volk who, meeting a Sweet
Briar lass to arrange a ride
back for her to school, walked
into the stricken fraternity
house about five or ten minutes
after one o’clock. Volk noticed
that an upholstered armchair
was on fire. He, realizing that
the fire was too intense for him

_to control single handedly,

quickly called the Police
Department to report the blaze.
As Volk made his call, PIKA
president Robert Sundberg, not
able to detect any wrongdoing
at this point, discovered the fire
and rushed to get the few
PIKAs, who had not gone to the
Munster House party, out of the
house.

Sophomore Norris Leffitte,
the first house resident down
the stairs, started the fire
fighting effort with the aid of
some Phi Delts. By this time,
however, the fire on the chair
had ignited a nearby sofa which
fed the flames to the drapes. At
this time, paint burst into
flames thereby engulfing the
whole room in destructive fiery
tongues. By the time the fire
department arrived to the
scene, the PIKAs and PHI

DELTS led by Leffitte (who suf-
fered slight burns on his hands),
armed with garden hoses and
fire extinguishers, had pretty
much put an end to the disaster.
The fire department remained
on the scene until safety from
reignition was assured.

Coincidentally, the fire came
less than 12 hours after fraterni-
ty had undergone an inspection
for possible fire hazards by
university officials and an in-
dependent inspector.

Lexington Fire Chief Charles
Conner confirmed Thursday

afternoon the extensive damage

included a partially charred
stereo, destroyed speakers, and
ob literated IM trophies and

plaques. Composite photos of
fraternity members survived
the blaze relatively unscathed.
Only the frames of these pic-
tures, of high sentimental value
and obviously irreplacable,
were lost.

Just after the fire, Dean of
Students Lewis John offered Pi
Kappa Alpha the full assistance
of the university. However,
fraternity president Sundberg
feels that the insurance com-
pany will cover all losses stem-
ming from the vandalism.

Sundberg, summarizing the
close call, said, “We're just
lucky it happened when it did. If
it had started at 3 a.m., we
might all be dead.”

resigns

by Lee Howard

Rick Goddard shocked the
Executive Committee Monday
night by announcing his
resignation, effective Jan. 2.

Goddard told the committee
he simply did not have enough
time to put into EC activities. In
forewarning theRing-tum Phi of
his resignation, Goddard
specifically mentioned a six
hour honor trial a couple of
weeks ago as an example of the
extraordinary time re-
quirements put on EC
members. Goddard is the senior
EC law representative.

Goddard’s leadership and
crusading style will be sorely
missed by the EC. Estimates of
the percentate of EC motions
Goddard was responsible for
this year range upward of 75 per
cent.

Goddard’s most important
acheivements in his 12years on
the EC were in the areas of
honor defendants rights and the
openness of government. He
was instrumental in passing
new honor code regulations
which required that the EC
must give a defendant at least
24 hours notice before an honor
trial can be held. The previous
regulations had required a
minimum of three hours.

Goddard also suggested the
EC be required to give a defen-
dant a written explaination of
the charge against him, as well

! Brate become

by Tom Salley

Outside of their social functions, a growing
number of Washington and Lee fraternities have
recently undertaken several community service
projects for local charities. Blood drives, Halloween
and Christmas parties for local children, and fund
raising projects have become almost as common as
the Wednesday night grain party. This is not a
chance occurence; some houses have community
service projects as a part of their unwritten by-
laws, while others have undertaken such projects as
a means to improve fraternity-town relations.
Whatever the motivation, these houses have
created constructive alternatives to the standard
fraternity activities.

Leading the list of civic-minded fraternities are
the ZBT’s, the Sigma Chi’s, and the Lambda Chi’s.
Contributing to a lesser extent are the Phi Psi’s, the
Pi Kapp’s, the KA’s, and the Fiji’s. The remainder
of the fraternities bring up the rear.

The Zeta Beta Tau chapter has been active in
community service in Lexington. Most recently, the
ZBT’s have completed a highly successful fund rais-
ing campaign for Unicef, collecting over $175 from
both students and local residents. The house has
also organized Easter Egg and Christmas parties
for local children, provided workers for the Na-
tional Association for Retarded Children’s Field
Day, and produced, for three out of four years, the
highest percentage of contributors in the annual
College Republican’s Blood Drive. For their efforts
over the past few years the ZBT’s have won two

 

—

Civic minded

trophies from the national organization in recogni-
tion of their community service.

The Sigma Chi’s have also been active in fulfilling
their civic responsibilities; they have assisted the
College Republicans in the Blood Drive, hosted a
Halloween party for local orphans, and entered a
good percentage of their membership in the M.S.
Walk-a-thon, either as walkers or sponsors.
Presently, they are looking for a suitable project to
serve as this year’s pledge project, which, in the
past, has been geared towards a community need.

The Lambda Chi’s, early aware of the
deteriorating state of town-gown relations, began a
series of civic-minded projects in an effort to im-
prove the image of the: fraternities among the
townspeople. Having appointed a special Public
Relations Chairman, the Lambda Chi’s last spring
organized a house litter project to clean up that fre-
quently abused recreation spot, Twin Falls. This
year they pan to hold a Senior Citizen’s Service Day
where the house members would be available to
elderly citizens for house and yard work at no cost.
And as a means to alleviate some of the complaints
from neighbors about noisy parties, the Lambda
Chi’s have instituted a policy of inviting all their
neighbors to their parties.

The Phi Psi’s have organized a car wash to raise
money for a relief fund for needy families, and
entered their pledges in last year’s Walk-a-thon.
The Pi Kapp’s helped the local March of Dimes
organization last year by going on a door-to-door

Lexington city ordinances
specify that persons using
stereo equipment loud enough
to be heard by ‘“‘the public’’ dur-
ing any part of the day must
first obtain a written permit
from the city manager’s office.

The often quoted city or-
dinance 15-32(b) makes specific
the hours between 11:00 p.m.
and 7:00 a.m., and a distance of
fifty feet as the criteria to be us-
ed for judging noise level. But
Section 15-33 states generally
that “‘except in public emergen-
cy’’ it is unlawful to use ‘‘sound-
amplifying equipment or
loudspeakers, in such a manner
that the sound or noise thereof
is audible to the public, without
a written permit from the city
manager.”’

Section 15-33 is important
especially in regard to the up-
Poo fraternity Christmas

 

house parties weekend. In order
not to be in violation of 15-33,
fraternity officers should obtain
a written permit from the city
manager.

But the permit will expire at
11 o’clock when 15-32(b) takes
effect. Fraternities ‘“‘producting
or reproducing sound’’ so as to
“disturb the peace, quiet and
comfort of the neighboring in-
habitants” (or sound heard
more than fifty feet away) after
11 p.m. take their own chances
for police intervention.

Sigma Phi Epsilon, already
fined for violation of the noise
ordinance, was quick to apply
for their permit. Social chair-
man Joe Scott, went to the city
manager’s office before the
Thanksgiving break, but his
hope was to obtain an extension
of the ordinance until midnight.

“‘We were told by the IFC that
the city manager could extend

for daytime stereo play

the ordinance until 12 p.m., but
his secretary only gave us a
permit from 8-12. They’ve
already nailed us once, we just
don’t want to get hasseled
again.”

President of the Interfraterni-
ty Council, Steve Mattesky, ex-
plained that city administrators
were very cautious in their
discussion about the noise or-
dinance with him. They told
him that the time limitation
might be extended. Thus far it
has not.

If they choose to enforce
15-33, the Lexington police can
stop any party—at any hour of
the day—where the noise level
is, in their opinion, ‘‘audible to
the public.” The purpose of the
written permit is to register the
party with the city and to gain
permission for the use of stereo
equipment until 11:00 p.m.

Automatic rule meeting planned

The Committee on the
Automatic Rule will meet at
10:30 a.m. on Wednesday,
December 21, 1977. At that time
the Committee will consider the
following groups of students,
who have fallen under the
Automatic Rule, for possible
immediate reinstatement:

(1) those students who failed
to meet the conditions of
Academic Probation required
of them at the end of the current
Fall Term.

(2) those students completing
a full academic year who failed

to meet the cumulative average
required of their class.

The Committee will consider
for immediate reinstatement
all students who fall under the
Automatic Rule. If any student
wishes to inform the Committee
of extenuating circumstances
present in his case, he may
write a letter to the Committee
and deliver it to the Office of the
Dean of the College before the
time of the Committee’s
meeting.

In general, the Committee

severs his connection with the
University; if the Committee
does not grant him immediate
reinstatement, he is not eligible
for reinstatement until after the
passage of at least one calendar
year.

As soon as possible after the
Committee’s meeting, each stu-
dent falling under the
Automatic Rule will receive a
letter explaining his status.

Any student who is not sub-
ject to the Automatic Rule in
December and who fails to
achieve the cumulative average
required of him at the end of the

notification that he is on

Noise ordinance disturbs student routine

Written permit required
Phi Kap on probation

by Charle Smith

The Washington and Lee In-
terfraternity Council has placed
Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity on
social probation until the end of
the fall term for an incident
which occurred during a Thurs-
day night party.

Lexington police had issued
two summonses for violations of
excessive noise. One was issued
to the Phi Kappa Sigma house
and the other to Phi Delta Theta
fraternity, which was also hav-
ing a party. In all, four frater-
nities have been found in viola-
tion of the existing noise or-
dinance.

The IFC’s disciplinary action
followed complaints by the Lex-
ington police that when the of-
ficer attempted to issue the
warrent at Phi Kappa Sigma,
he was verbally abused.

An egg was also thrown, strik-
ing the officer’s car, police said.

The officer, Ptl. J. K. Colbert,

police had told them that

was unable to find a house of-
ficer to issue the summons. A
junior member of the fraterni-
ty, Rob Calvert, accepted it.
University officials said the

Calvert was very courteous and
apologetic about the incident.

IFC President Steve Mat-
tesky said that the probation
will extend from Sunday, Nov.
28 to Friday, Dec. 16.

The incident occurred during
a party in which the fraternity
was celebrating the completion
of a social probation-penalty for
alleged violations with their
pledges, Mattesky said.

Representing Phi Kappa
Sigma at Friday’s meeting
were five members of the
fraternity, including its presi-
dent, Ben Johns. In addition to
the IFC Judicial Board, Dean of
Students Louis John and Coor-
dinator of Fraternities Dan
Murphy were at the meeting.

Dining hall rates
high in survey

by Kevin Dwyer

For at least 500 people in the
W&L community, Letitia P.
Evans Dining Hall is the
substitute for Mom’s home
cooking one or more times dai-
ly. The largest group which
dines there is, of course, the
freshman class, but many up-
perclassmen eat there, too.

No one argues about the beau-
ty of the physical plant; the
question is: Is the food worth
eating? A survey was taken by
the Ring-tum Phi three weeks
ago to determine how people
feel about the food they are get-
ting.

Twenty people were inter-
viewed each night of the survey,
which lasted one week, and the
numbers were kept static: 14
freshmen and 6 upperclassmen
each night. Those interviewed
were asked three basic ques-
tions.

1. Do you like this particular

meal?
Evaluated overall, there were
more ‘‘yes’’ answers than ‘‘no”’
ones. All in all, 48 per cent of
those surveyed said ‘‘no”’ and 52
per cent said ‘‘yes.”’

2. Do you generally like din-

ing hall food?
Here is where the dining hall
really came out on top. Over 70
per cent of those questioned
said they liked dining hall food
in general.

3. What category of food

disappoints you most?
A few people couldn’t fault any
aspect of dining hall food, but of
those who answered, over 75 per
cent said meats disappointed
them in one way or another.
Most said they wanted seconds,
and a few complained about
meat quality. The second
highest complaint concerned
vegetables, which many
thought tasteless. A few specific
things: one complained of
“‘chicken-itis,” and a few more
never want to see tomato sauce
again. Several said the dining
hall runs out of things before the
end of the dining period, and
many want more ice cream.

Overall, though, most of those
interviewed gave Jerry Darrell

and the dining hall high marks.

Darrell was interviewed last
week about his responsibilities.
This is the second year Darrell
has headed the independent
University Food Service.
Before this the dining hall was
affiliated with ARA food ser-
vices. He has found that large
national food co anies still give
him a break despite his in-
dependent status. He saves by
not having to pay ARA fees as
well.

Darrell sayd, ‘‘There’s no
reason why we can’t do a good
job. We’ve got the resources
and the supplies. So we have the
responsibility.”’

The dining hall has always ex-
perienced a lot of waste, and
Darrell says this year is no dif-
ferent. One dramatic gesture he
used to emphasize waste was to
take one lunch’s wasted sub-
marine sandwiches and put
them on display outside the
cafeteria door at dinnertime.
Many found it distasteful, but
many others felt it proved a
point.

“There were 100 sandwiches
there,’’ says Darrell. “I think
that’s way too much waste.”

This year, Darrell is overseer
of four University concerns: the
Co-op, the Cockpit, the Supply
Store, and the dining hall. He
says he’s considerably busier
this year, but it’s not too much
work because he has great help.

“Frances Davis and Dan
Scott are terrific workers,’
says Darrell. Davis is super-
visor of the Cockpit, and Scott is
an alumnus who works with
scheduling and the Music Union
for weekend live acts.

“The place is really enliven-
ed,” Darrell says, ‘‘and we owe
a lot of it to those two and the
other fine workers over there.”’

There have been numerous
complaints about how the Co-op
and Supply Store are organized
this year. Darrell defends the
system and describes it as
much faster and more efficient
for everyone, both customer
and worker .

“People must like it,’’ says
Darrell, ‘“‘since the Co-op has

already broken its sales record
twice.”’

He has praise for Famie
Smothers, a 25-year university
employee and the Co-op super-
visor and the others who work
at the Co-op and Supply Store.

“They’re happy with the new
system, too,” Darrell says.

“‘T just found out in July that I
had to manage the Co-op,” Dar-
rell says. “I refused to do it
under the inefficient conditions.
that existed there, and so a
reorganization took place.”’

Jerry Darrell says that the
reorganization was all done w
ithin the space of a week, and
that he felt it the most efficient
and sensible system. When ask-
ed why the Supply Store was
separated from the Co-op, Dar-
rell replies, ‘It’s more efficient.
The two operations differ great-
ly and it makes sense to have
them separated. Besides, the

- Supply Store loses money at

night.”’

Darrell continuously stresses
efficiency and low cost, which
he believes enables him to keep
student costs lower and helps
him to initiate things such as
the night-owl specials, Co-op
low-cost food combinations
which are changed weekly.

Only praise for the dining hall
was heard following Nov.:21’s
special Thanksgiving feast.
This reporter can testify—the
food was absolutely fantastic
and those Lex high school girls
for waitresses! It was worth
staying the whole weekend for
that meal.

Freshman vice president Bob
Willis chairs the Evans Dining
Hall Food Committee, which
meets every Thursday evening
during dinner in the dining hall.
“You're welcome to come,”
says Willis. “‘We usually move
around the dining hall from
week to week.”

Darrell appreciates and acts
on imput, both from the food
committee, and from the sug-
gestion box. But, Darrell says,
describing one useless offering
from the box, “It sucks’ isn’t a
very concrete suggestion. If it’s
a good one, we'll use it.”’

Lee-Jackson House

The year-long restoration of
the Lee-Jackson House . at
Washington and Lee University
has been completed and the
historic building has once again
become a private residence.

The house -- built in 1841-42 --
was the home of Thomas J.
(Stonewall) Jackson before the
Civil War, and of Robert E. Lee
and his family just after the
war.

The meticulous restoration
was planned and directed by J.
Everette Fauber Jr. of Lyn-
chburg, the well-known restora-
tion and preservation architect.
Part of the project involved ex-
tensive historical research,
which was carried out as the
work progressed.

Dr. and Mrs. Edward C., At-
wood Jr. have moved into the
house. Atwood is the dean of the
W&L’s School of Commerce,

Economics and Politics. The
four antebellum residences on
the Washington and Lee front
campus, including the Lee-
Jackson House, have
customarily been occupied by a
dean or senior professor ever
since they were built.

The restoration project in-
cluded repointing the exterior
brickwork and _ considerable
structural work on the wing in
which Jackson and his bride liv-
ed in 1853-54. The interior,
which had been modified only
slightly in the 135 years since
the house was built, has also
been restored faithfully.

The living and dining rooms
and the entryway in the house
are being furnished with mid-
19th-century pieces of the kind
that were in it when Jackson
and, later, the Lee family lived
there.

restored, occupied

The house was built as the of-
ficial residence of the president
of Washington College, as the
school was then known.
Stonewall Jackson, a professor
at neighboring Virginia
Military Institute, married
Eleanor Junkin, daughter of the
college president, in 1853, and
they lived with her parents. She
died 14 months after their wed-
ding, but Jackson remained a
member of the Junkin
household for several more
years.

Robert E. Lee moved into the
house when he became presi-
dent of the college five months
after Appomattox. He and his
family, which joined him short-
ly after he arrived in August,
1865, lived there until a new,
larger president’s house was
completed neyt door in 1869.

E.C. votes to allow
charge in “Pit”’

by Lee Howard

The Executive Committee
voted 6-5 Monday night to allow
the Cockpit to ask no more than
50 cents cover charge from
students during the per-
formance of Sonny Land Slim
last night.

Slom, a 70-year-pld black
blues pianist, cost the Music
Union $300 for one night’s per-
formance and the Union was
trying to alleviate the cost by
requesting the cover charge.

Dan Scott, night manager of
the Cockpit, told theRing-tum
Phi later, however, that he
thinks the Cockpit might not
charge a cover after all. He said
he thinks doing so would create
more hassle than it’s worth. He
said he had to talk to Galen
Trussell, chairman of the Music
Union to straighten the whole
thing out. Trussell requested
EC approval of the cover
charge.

The Phi went to press before
it could determine for sure
whether a cover charge had
been asked.

In any case, the EC did set a
precedent in ratifying the cover
charge. Scott said that,
although the performance by
professional entertainers
scheduled for yesterday and
this weekend will.not require a
cover charge, a possible per-
formance by Dave Van Ronk
scheduled for later this year
may have to be supplemented
by a cover.

Scott said Van Ronk inspired
such singers as Bob Dylan, Joni
Mitchell and Judy Collins
before they ‘‘sold out” to the
popular music field. Unlike the
other stars, Van Ronk is still
playing his own music, Scott
said. He added that Van Ronk
had been playing at ‘‘The Cellar
Door,”’ a famous night club in
Washington, for cover charges
of from five to eight dollars.

This weekend, Roy
Bookbinder will play in the
Cockpit, Scott said. Bookbinder
will cost the Music Union $375
for two nights, according to
Trussell.

Steve Abraham, George Grif-
fin, Chris Gammon, Rick God-
dard, Andy Bodenstab and
Doug Perkins’ voted for the

cover charge. Mike Missal,
Jack Bovay, Jim Underhill,
Neil Pentifallo and Jim Davis
voted against it.

Missal was the most vocal op-
ponent of cover charges. He
said he thinks cover charges
would exclude some students,
despite the fact that the Cockpit
should be for all students. He
also disputed Trussell’s conten-
tion that 150 students would pay
the cover charge. Trussell said
that even if the projection of 150
was a bit too high, at least a
cover would off set some of the
costs of the performer.

Trussell said the cover
charge is an experiment; the
Music Union wants to see how it
goes. He also said he had gotten
permission from James
Whitehead, W&L’s treasurer,
to impose a cover charge.

Missal later told the Phi it is
his understanding that
Whitehead told Trussell it was
alright to have a cover charge
so long as he consulted the EC
first.

In other action by the EC, it
voted unanimously to give
honor trial defendants the right
to see a copy of all physical
evidence to be used against him
in an honor trial before the trial
is held. Specifically, the
physical evidence would be
given to him when the charges
are served. This would give a
student at least 24 hours to
‘“‘prepare a meaningful
defense,’’ Goddard said. Under
new procedures passed by the
EC last year, the committee
must give a student at least 24
hours warning before an honor
trial can be held.

Griffin announced that he and
Missal had set up a pre-exam
orientation program to instruct
freshmen and upperclassmen
exactly what is expected of
them during exams. A
freshman class honor orienta-
tion seminar will be held Thurs-
day, Dec. 9 in Lee Chapel, Grif-
fin said. Additionally, letters
will be sent out to up-
perclassmen reminding them
that independent exams are on
trial, he said.

Upperclassmen, of course,
would also be encouraged to

ENTERTAINMENT

As You Like It
to be performed Sunday

The National Shakespeare
Company will be presenting its
production of William
Shakespeare’s As You Like It
on Sunday at Doremus Gym-
nasium at8 p.m.

No more delightful setting for
romance could be created than
the forest of Arden and it is here
that Shakespeare brings to life
one of his most enchanting com-
edies. As You Like It is com-
pounded of many elements, but
the whole is set to some of
Shakespeare’s loveliest poetry.
Kindliness, good fellowship,
good-will—these are the
elements of As You Like It, and
Shakespeare shows their
degree of worth.

As You Like It involves an ex-
iled duke and his daughter
Rosalind, who has grown up
under the charge of Frederick,
the duke’s brother and usurper
of his dukedom. Eventually,
Rosalind falls in love with
Orlando, sworn enemy to the
evil duke, and, disguised as a
man, sets out to find her own
father. At least four sets of
lovers undergo antics of
mistaken identity and unre-
quited love throughout Arden’s
forest, culminating in a mass
wedding and reconciliation.

The National Shakespeare
Company’s production of As
You Like It is directed by Sue
Lawless. The retreat . from
society to the forest of Arden
suggested a directorial ap-
proach that incorporates the
music and “back to nature”
philosophy of the 1960’s.

Shakespeare on wheels—The
National Shakespeare Com-
pany, one of America’s oldest
and most respected classical
touring organizations, is
celebrating its 15th anniversary
this year. The Cubiculo, the
Company’s experimental

dance/theatre based in New
York, is honoring its 10th an-
niversary this year, and The
National Shakespeare Com-
pany Conservatory is currently
in its fifth year. It is a big year
for anniversaries and we are
proud to have The National
Shakespeare Company in Lex-
ington on Dec. 4.

The Company has earned its
enviable reputation from its
Founder, Artistic Director and
Producer, Philip Meister. Mr.
Meister started with a special
commitment to perform “‘the
classics” for audiences across
the country who would other-
wise never have such an op-
portunity. With this endeavor
and an old station wagon, The
Company took off for their first
tour.

Since then, The National
Shakespeare Company (a non-
profit organization) has per-
formed for audiences of over
250,000 per year in colleges,
universities, high schools and
cultural centers across the na-
tion. The Conservatory has ex-

panded its enrollment con-
siderably over the past few
years ; several students have, in
fact, gone on to tour with The
Shakespeare Company. The
Cubiculo has similarly expand-
ed as more and more artists are
taking advantage of its ser-
vices.

Although recognition must go
to the countless directors,
designers, actors and_ staff
members who have contributed
their efforts and talents, the
legend behind The National
Shakespeare Company is, of
course Philip Meister—a man
whose dedication, enterprise
and passion has reached au-
diences for fifteen years.

Each season’s nine-month
trek takes The National
Shakespeare Company from
Florida to the Maritimes, from
New York to California and
Canada with three plays in its
repetoire. This season includes;
As You Like It, TheWinter’s
Tale and Othello, directed by
Sue Lawless, Mario Siletti and
Philip more Meister, respec-
tively.

fers such a diversity of choice.
Through the wide variety of
subjects, there is something for
all ages: information, emotion,
humor, beauty and just plain

enjoyment. Such neat
packages.
Books last! They aren’t

swallowed at once and gone
forever; they can be relished
again and again. They can even
have a different flavor each
time of reading.

If I were a young man hunting
for a book for my best love I
would pick - say - Tolkein’s
great bestseller, The
Silamarillion, John Fowles’
Daniel Martin, the Sierra Club
Wilderness Calendar or The Art
of Kissing by Morris.

For my grandmother, who
has slipped me nice little checks
now and then, I could find The
Audubon Field Guide to Birds,
Dore’s Bible Illustrations, or
Plain and Fancy: American
Women and Their Needlework.

For my younger brother who
doesn’t think much of reading I
could entice him with Science
Fiction Tales, The Star Trek
Concordance, or Pyramid a
fascinating diagramatic book of
how the pyramids were built.

And what would I give my
father, my mother and a very
young nephew? Such ideas will
pour forth next week.

You can’t loose with a book.

**Attack on the boob tube”’

The Land of Oz

by Seth Oserin

This past vacation gave me
the rare opportunity to sample
the more renowned offerings of
the television industry. It prov-
ed to be an experience beyond
the realms of anything im-
aginable, including sanity.

The reason for all this, of
course, is that group of which
many, through the years, have
come to scorn in old age, and
which receives an amazingly
constant degree of catering
from manufacturers and adver-
tising agencies. Of course, it’s
the kids.

Now I'll grant you, the
younger group is a_ viable
market, and TV would be
foolish to omit them from their
programming. But let’s face it,
do we really need kidvid (the
name affectionately given to
Saturday morning programm-
ing) at prime time? Is it really
necessary to be able to see the
Six Million Dollar man making
it with the Bionic Woman while
the Hulk watches as Wonder
Woman gives him a back rub?

Life is too short for stupidity
such as this. However, the
worst part is that all program-
ming has been saturated with

ever seen ‘‘Laverne and

King Kong eat a Tootsie Roll.
Or how about “Three is Com-

mer’s ample chest. The rest of

Who cares if there’s a gay man
in the show? The only in-

that every kid under the age of

logic at all, especially since all

- Wind Quintet Reviewed

by Robert Tremblay

The Clarion Wind Quintet liv-
ed up to its named at Lee
Chapel a few- Thursdays ago
with a concert that was certain-
ly marked by clarity and
sureness of tone. The ensemble,
which included Philip Dunigan,
flute; Robert Listokin, clarinet;
Joseph Robinson, oboe;
Frederick Bergstone, horn; and
Mark Popkin, bassoon, played a
program focusing on composers
of the late 19th century and on
20th century composers as well.

The concert began with Three
Short Pieces by the French
composer, Jacques Ibert. These
charming works were typically
French in their melodic content
and gave the quintet a chance to
demonstrate the possibilities
and variety of tone color that is
unique to this ensemble; the
French being the first nation to
really concentrate on writing
for the woodwind quintet.

Next was the demanding
Variations and Fugue on a
Theme of Handel by Brahms,
which was originally written for
piano and is a work that can be
a bit tedious in its intellectual
pursuits, but arranged here by
the group’s bassoonist, Mark
Popkin, the piece gained a little
life as well as losing about ten
minutes in length of per-
formance.

Robert Stewart’s Five Visions
followed the intermission and
was a work that impressed a
number of people who were pro-
bably expecting the clarinetist

to play his instrument from the
other end, but instead heard a
piece that in its descriptive and
cohesive power proved to be one
of the more popular pieces on
the program.

August Klughardt’s Quintet
op. 79 displayed the romantic
qualities of many beautiful
melodies and harmonies as well
as the romantic quality of not
knowing when to stop writing
these many beautiful melodies
and harmonies. But length
aside, this was a stunning piece
of music.

The concert concluded with
one of the few masterpieces
written sepcifically for wood-
wind quintet—Kleine Kammer-
musikby Paul Hindemith. Like
Ibert’s Three Short Pleces, this
work gives the quintet a chance
to show off the variety of tone
olompossible here, but, unlike
the French composition,
Hindemith places the quintet in
a far more advanced musical
atmosphere. The piece is mark-
ed by diversity of style as well
as displaying Hindemith’s own
unmistakable genius.

The concert, on a whole, was
an excellent one and no doubt
very satisfying for those who
have not heard a woodwind
quintet before. It’s a shame that
there isn’t more music written
for this ensemble, but maybe
with. a few more groups as fine
as the Clarion Wind Quintet, a
few more composers might
start concentrating on writing
for this tragically neglected
genre.

Musical M

by Mark Mainwaring

After a rather slow fall
season, the rush of Christmas
album releases if finally under-
way. These include new LPs
from Roxy Music, Alice Cooper,
Rod Stewart, Eric Clapton, and
Al Stewart, to name just a few.
Two of the more interesting
releases—from ELP and
Genesis—are reviewed in ths
week’s Mainstream.Works,
Volume 2
Emerson Lake & Palmer
Atlantic SD 19147

ELP’s Works, Vol. 1, released
last March, was a musical
breakthrough for the band, and
a frist-rate album as well. Un-
fortunately, many of the
group’s fans seem to have been
turned off by the abundance of
extended, highly orchestrated
songs on the record. Its sales
were not as good as expected,
and attendance on ELP’s subse-
quent world tour was extremely
disappointing. The press
release accompanying Works,
Volumne 2 makes a big point of
noting that the album contains
‘“‘no less than 12 compositions,
all clocking in at under five
minutes.’ Orchestration has
also been kept to a minimum.
After the underwhelming suc-
cess ofWorks, Volume 1, ELP
decided to go commercial?

It’s really hard to say. More
than anything, Works, Volume 2
is inconsistent, it just doesn’t fit
together like past ELP albums.
Five of the songs are old
singles, recorded at various

Ju paintings

on exhibit

An exhibition of 20 recent
paintings by I-Hsiung Ju will
take place during the next two
weeks in the duPont Art Gallery
at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity.

Ju is associate professor and
artist-in-residence at W&L.

Ju will exhibit two kinds of
paintings. Ten will be album
leaves—paintings of rice paper
or gold leaves, mounted on
cardboard.

Ju siad he brought several
album leaves from China when
he came to the United States in
1968 and his recent rediscovery
of them inspired these new
works. They are quite small and
finely detailed paintings, he
said.

There will also be ten con-
siderably larger paintings ex-
ecuted in acrylic and oil paint.
Ju said these paintings were
done as demonstrations in the
techniques used with oil and
acrylics for his students at
W&L.

They are an experimental
compilation of images taken
from photographs of the local
landscape, Ju said. He says that
after living here for eight years
the area has made a deep im-
pression on him and his work.

Ho Hao-Tien, director of the
National Museum of History in
Taiwan, has said Ju is ‘‘one of
the few Chinese artists who can
blend two worlds into one and
enrich his work with modern
techniques, yet remain still
essentially Oriental.’’

He also said that Ju’s techni-
que possesses tne same spirit as
the great masters of the past.

times and _ previously
unavailable on an album.
‘“‘Honky. Tonk Train Blues’’ and
“‘Barrelhouse Shake-down”’ are
the best of these, demonstrating
once again Keith Emerson’s
tremendous ability and ver-
satility on keyboards. Of the
new material, ‘‘Maple Leaf
Rag’’ and Car! Palmer’s ‘‘Close
But Not Touching’’ are stan-
douts, the latter a big band-
style number along the lines of
“Food For Your Soul’ (from
the last album).

The rest of Works, Volume 2,
though, isn’t up to ELP’s usual
high standard. Greg Lake’s
ballads don’t even approach the
beauty of ‘Lucky Man,”’ ‘‘Still
You Turn Me On,” or even
“C’est La Vie,”’ and his vocals
on some of the other tracks
(especially ‘‘Brain Salad
Surgery’) are very poor in-
deed. Furthermore, the short-
ness of the album’s 12 songs
doesn’t allow time for the
thematic and musical develop-
ment at which ELP excels—just

ainstream

 

teresting, it’s over. Works,
Volume 2 will probably be well
received by the group’s fans,
but Emerson Lake & Palmer
can do better than this.

Seconds Out
Genesis
Atlantic 2-SD9002

Genesis was recently voted
“best live act’’ by readers of the
British music publication
Melody Maker, and Seconds
Out shows why. This band in
concert is almost flawless
technically, and the rich texture
of their music loses almost
nothing in the transition from
studio to the stage. From the
opening chord of ‘‘Squonk,”’ to
the epic ‘‘Supper’s Ready,’’ to
the closing song, “Los Endos,”’
the members of Genesis
demonstrate their instrumental
virtuosity—excellent with one
exception: the drumming. Phil
Collins Genesis’ studio drum-
mer, devotes most of his time

Swimmers Win
Season Opener

Win after win after win.
That’s what the W&L swim-
mers seem to be accomplishing
the past few seasons, and
1977-78 appears as if it will
follow recent tradition. Coach
Bill Stearns’ mermen started
the new year with a 58-55 win
over James Madison in Har-
risonburg.

The Generals turned in some
superb early season times, in-
cluding three new school
records. Senior and 13 time All-
American John Hudson swam
the 1000 free in 9:46.994 break-
ing his own mark. That time
would have been good enought
to win the national champion-
ship in both Divisions II and III
last year. He also qualified for
the nationals in the 500 free.

Co-captain Keith Romich set
a new mark in the 200 fly with a
2:03.990 clocking breaking his
old mar,. The third record was
set by the 400 medley relay
team composed of sophomores
Drew Pillsbury, Scott Duff, Bob
Newcomb and freshman Will
Hodges as they swam the
distance in 3:47.79.

Other individual winners for
the Generals were Keith
Romich in the 200 free
(1:49.305), Bob Newcomb in the
50 (22.811) and 100 free (50.541),
Drew Pillsbury in the 200 in-
dividual medley (2:08.437), and
John Hudson in the 500 free
(4:50.712). W&L’s next action is
on December 3rd when they
travel east to take on the
University of Richmond.

We Win 89-88

Generals Catch H. S.
Tigers In Final Minutes

by Mark Mitchell

Senior Bob Forlenza came off
the bench last night to spark the
Washington and Lee Generals
to an 89-88 victory over the
Hampden-Sydney Tigers.

The game matched two teams
who possess powerful offenses
and porous defenses. The game
was a dramatic, although not an
artistic, masterpiece. However,
the Generals gained control of
the defensive boards at the end,
Collins plucking down karom
after karom, to insure the vic-
tory. In fact, the Generals out
rebounded the larger Tigers 42
to 40. They also outshot H.S.

52% to 49%.

The first half see-sawed back
and forth. W&L jumped off to a
13-8 lead, as the Tigers seemed
nervous. However, aided by the
General’s poor shot selection,
Hampden-Sydney took the lead
at 22-17. Larry Meyer scored on
a behind-the-back pass from
Forlenza to give the Generals a
27-26 lead. Subsequently, Meyer
hit a succession of shots,
posting his larger defender.

McHenry Departs From
Wilson Field Sidelines

by Jim Barnes

Bill McHenry, Washington
and Lee’s head football coach,
announced his resignation from
that post immediately following
W&L’s 20-18 victory over
Georgetown in the season finals
on November 19th. He will re-
main at W&L as the athletic
director and continue to chair
the Department of Health and
Physical Education.

University’s faculty in the fall
of 1971 as Athletic Director and
Department Chairman, and
assumed the position of Head
Football Coach in 1973. He was
an All-Star center at W&L from
1951-53, and captained the
Generals his senior season.
After being named the Univer-
sity’s Outstanding Major Sport
Athlete in 1953-54, he was
selected for both the 1953 Blue-
Gray Football Game and the
1954 College All-Star Game.
Apparently McHenry had in-
formed his assistants of his in-
tention to resign halfway
through the season, after the
Hampden-Sydney game. He did
not, however, publicly state his
resignation to his players until

after the Georgetown game.

His speech was a short state-
ment recalled by one member
of the football team as, ‘This
will be my last game.”

The timing of the statement
dimmed what was a jubilant
locker room scene, and created
a saddened group of men who
had worked since August in a
joint effort to turn the football
program around at W&L. One
player recalled how he was
“shocked and dumbfounded’
after McHenry announced his
decision. Many players were
upset over the coach’s decision
to retire from the head football
position. Another player com-
mented that McHenry was also
visably shaken over what he
was Saying.

It seems as though, in an ef-
fort to improve the football pro-
gram, McHenry is stepping
down to allow a new face and a
new look to take the helm-of
W&L’s struggling football pro-
gram. McHenry’s five year
record was 12-36-2. His 1977
team completed the season with
a 3-8 won-loss record, and a
fourth place finish in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference.
Before coming to W&L,
McHenry coached football and
served as Athletic Director at
Lebanon Valley College, and

‘also coached at Williams Col-

lege and Pennsylvania Military
College.

No successor has_ been
named. McHenry is beginning
an immediate search for a head
coach who will be responsible
for rebuilding the Washington
and Lee football program.
Several interviews have been
conducted and it seems as
though next year’s coach will

not be chosen from any of
W&L’s assistant coaches. It
also seems likely that some new
assistant coaches are going to
be brought in from the outside.
The position of current
assistants is uncertain. There is
some speculation around
Doremus that any coaches re-
tained by the next year’s head
coach will have to be approved
by him.

Several players have com-
mented that McHenry could not
have worked any harder to
make the football team a win-
ner this year. One player said
that everybody made mistakes
this season, but McHenry, as
head football coach, ultimately
must shoulder the _ conse-
quences of those mistakes.

Generals

W&L soccer coach Rolf Pira-
nian was named the ODAC’s
Soccer Coach of the Year by a
vote of the conference coaches
last Tuesday. The second year
coach, a 1974 graduate of the
University, led the Generals to
a 2-2 ODAC mark and a second
place conference finish. They
also won the championship of
the VISA Western Division II
and the Virginia Wesleyan
Tournament. Five of Piranian’s
players were selected for the
VISA All-Star game to be held
this Sunday, the most ever for a
W&L soccer team.

Two of Piranian’s players
were named to the first team
allODAC soccer team for
1977—forward Bill Stone, a

But, the Generals did not stop
Sydney’s offense so the teams
were exchanging baskets. Near
the end of the half, however,
Sydney took control of the game
and the refs to post a five-point
half-time lead.

The second half started out
with the teams trading baskets
with Hampden-Sydney getting
the better of the shoot out. Their
lead bulged to eight and then re-
mained at five. For a long time
it appeared that the Tigers
could not be stopped. Finally
they cooled off.

Forlenza, on the other hand,
did not cool off. He hit a series
of shots from downtown, allow-
ing the Generals to tie the score
at 67 all with ten minutes re-
maining. Moments later Wenke
and Leunig combined on a
beautiful give and go play to
give the Generals the lead at
71-69. But the Generals were not
able to pull away.

The Tigers roared back. They
overcame a three-point deficit
to obtain a one-point lead and
the ball with two-and-a-half
minutes remaining. The Tigers
then called a time-out and then
went into what appeared to be a
freeze. The Generals remained
cool, stayed in their 1-3-1 half-
court zone, and finally Leunig
stole the ball.

Seconds later, Bruce
Williams was_ fouled
underneath. He hit his first
shot, tying the score, but missed
his second. Ardith Collins re-

bounded it, gave it to Leunig’—

who found Williams alone
underneath. Bruce hit the shot
giving W&L an 89-87 lead. The
Generals got the ball back
leading 89-88, and went into the
four corners. With a little over
thirty seconds remaining Den-
nis attempted a difficult lay-up.
The ball went off the rim, was
fought for, appeared to hit a
Hampden-Sydney player as it
went out of bounds, but was
awarded to the Tigers.

The Tigers called time out
with 22 seconds left and again
with nine seconds left, playing

-who came

for the last shot. Actually they
got four shots, but none went in
the basket. Washington and Lee
survived the shoot out to win its
first conference game of the
year against the talented
Tigers.

The game answered many
questions the fans may have
had about the Generals. Can-
field was correct when he listed
his bench as a positive factor in
the team’s success. Coach Can-
field played ten players, and all
contributed. Jim Berlin gave
the team some needed rebounds
early in the game; Smitherman
blocked a few shots; Bruce
Williams scored the team’s last
three points; and Bobby Forlen-
za played well enough to keep
Wenke on the bench most of the
second half even though Mike
was five for seven from the
floor while dealing out eight
assists.

The team even did a credible
job on the defensive boards. Ar-
dith played a very solid center
and rebounded well
underneath, but a lot of the
credit for the Generals’ suc-
cessful defensive rebounding
belong to Dave Leunig. Leunig
guarded Bob Burrell, a forward
into the game
averaging 15 rebounds a game.
Burrell came away with five re-
bounds, partly because Leunig
kept Burrell twenty or more
feet away from the basket most
of the time. Burrell, a strong in-
side player, resembled the
ODAC’s largest (and most con-
fused) guard as he handled the
ball, not underneath the basket,
but in the corner.

The Generals showed that
they are indeed winners by
bouncing back from last Satur-
day’s ignominous defeat and by
not allowing the erratic of-
ficiating to both them.
However, better execution,
especially on defense will be
necessary for the Generals to be
winners this Saturday when
they invade Lynchburg.

Football Team Closes
Season On High Note

The W&L football team com-
bined a consistent offensive per-
formance with a clutch defen-
sive showing last Saturday on
Wilson Field and proceeded to
win their final game of the 1977
season. The 20-18 win over
Georgetown University was the
team’s third win of the season
against eight defeats, and was
also W&L’s fourth straight vic-
tory over the Hoyas. The
Generals had earlier completed
their ODAC season with a 1-3
mark.

Seven seniors made their
final game one to remember led
by co-captains Jeff Slatcoff, a
potential All-American
linebacker, and offensive
center Mark Duncan. The five
remaining seniors on the 1977
squad were quarterback Ted
Hissey, tight end Bob Szczecin-
ski, split end Bill Frear,
halfback Ed Johnson and defen-
sive back Phil Bailey.

The game started out as a
battle of field goal kickers as
the Hoyas’ Ed Delgado kicked
three pointers from 43 and 44
yards, and W&L’s freshman
kicker Dave Edward booted one
from 21 yards, his first as a
General. Edward later kicked
one from 38 yards that proved to
be the winning points.

W&L led 106 at the half
behind Edward’s field goal and
PAT and Ted Hissey’s five yard
run. They went on top 17-6 with
11:00 remaining in the third
quarter when sophomore
Stewart Atkinson rambled 40
yards around right end for six
points. The Hoyas closed the
gap to five points with a 11 yard
TD pass from Bob Sitz to Jim
Boland, but the pass for two
points was followed by a hard
Generals’ pass rush.

After Edward’s second field
goal, Georgetown hit paydirt on
a two yard run by Boland with
3:28 left in the game bringing
the score to 20-18. That put the
pressure on the W&L defense to
stop the two point conversion,
which they did by sacking Sitz
as he looked in vain for an open
receiver. The W&L defense
limited Georgetown to 93 total
passing yards and 202 on the
ground, with 60 of those coming
on one run by Stiz.

W&L dominated the game
statistically with 430 yards in
total offense, 308 on the ground
and 122 through the air. The
Generals’ had the ball for 66
plays to the Hoyas’ 40 plays.
Hissey completed 9 of 14 passes

ting the stuffing knocked out of
them 59-38. They lost the game
against York College, 97-95
Saturday, despite going to the
locker room after the first half
with a 19 point lead.

However, the Generals did
have an excellent game against
Clinch Valley the previous
night, whipping the Cavaliers
108-81.

Spartans received 31 points to
the Generals’ 9 points from the
line.

Coach Verne Canfield com-
mented, ‘It disturbs me when
you get a hose job at home.”’
However, he said he was not go-
ing to let the team use this as an
excuse. He said the Generals
simply did not play well enough
to win. Meanwhile the Spartans
were psyched up and playing
very well, he said.

Indeed, the Spartans did
seem to be playing over their
heads in the second half, hitting
63 per cent of their field goal at-

in his final game. Atkinson had
another super afternoon with
213 yards on 34 carries in-
cluding the 40 yard TD run. The
213 yard total is only two yards
shy of the school record of 215
yards which Atkinson set
earlier in the year against
Bridgewater.

With two 200 yard plus after-
noons, the sophomore speedster
finished the season with 767
yards playing in only eight
games, the third highest single

season total in W&L history
(John Anthony, W&L ‘67, holds
the record with 915 yards.)
Atkinson now has 1270 yards in
two seasons. With a 95.9
average per game, he finished
the year as the ODAC’s second
leading rusher.

Junior flanker Richard Wiles
cuaght three Hissey passes for
47 yards against Georgetown
and now has 92 in three seasons,
tying him for fourth with Chap-

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

COP-OUT

It is the present policy of the Lexington Police Department to not
fully disclose to the public and press all information relating to ar-
rest records and issued court summonses. Although we are told a
previous chief initiated the policy, Chief James Kirby is in full sup-
port and agreement with it. Thus, he has full responsibility for the
present policies and actions of his police force.

City Attorney William Roberts has attempted to provide legal
justification for the policy, but we just cannot agree with his inter-
pretation of the law. We read the purpose of Virginia’s Freedom of
Information Act as the legal mechanism for making more informa-
tion available to the public—not less. Counsel Roberts apparently
disagrees with this intent of the statute because, under present
policy, the Police Department can and is keeping secret police
records we believe should be made public under any reasonable in-
terpretation of the law.

The importance of all this is that abuses of power can infiltrate
and corrupt a system if its affairs are conducted in secret. The
reason for making records public is to make abuses of power less
likely, so that the police cannot ‘‘cover up” their own mistakes.
This is not to imply that Chief Kirby’s police department is involved
in any improprieties, violations of the law or the civil rights of in-
dividuals. But the citizens of Lexington must be protected from the
possibility that some member of the present or future Police
Department may abuse his power because of 4 confidence that he
can use the secret policies to hide impropieties.

We cannot agree with Mr. Roberts, restrictively narrow inter-
pretation of the Freedom of Information Act. Mr. Roberts asserts
that the police have the authority to refuse public disclosure of
records of arrests and summonses. He says that the police can
make some records available when they choose to do so, but are not
obliged to make the records available immediately. We disagree.
The fact that our position is supported by the Virginia Bar and the
Virginia Press Associations makes us more confident in our convic-
tion that Mr. Roberts is wrong. The recent statements by Attorney
General Troy make Mr. Roberts’ position even more untenable.

A LAMENTATION

It is a lamentable occasion when an organization loses its main
driving force. It is even more lamentable for the people the
organization serves. Rick Goddard’s resignation from the EC is
a cause for lamentation and concern. His role as the crusader for
the letter of the law and the shoes he used to trod down that dark
lonely path will be hard to fill. What should add to the public’s
frustation is most of the members of the EC are glad to see him go.

Mr. Goddard was not your run of the mill W&L student. He brust
into the ranks of the EC representatives last year in faded blue
jeans with hair falling below his collar. His views were many times
radically opposed to the opinions of the other EC members, though
he was only interpreting the letter of the law as he felt it should be
interpreted. In essence, he was willing to go out on a limb and sub-
ject himself to public criticism for what he believed, which is more
than most of our EC members have shown to be willing to do.

For a man who was worried about honor, handling of student
money, and responsibleness of committee chairman, there is little
wonder he felt his hands were tied when nearly every motion he
proposed recently was scoffed at and defeated by votes of 8-1 and
9-1. The motions, similar in nature to the one which established ac-
counting procedures for committees, were good ones and above the
comments of his peers. But it is hard to implement change in the
‘khaki culture”’ if you aren’t a member.

Though it would be in the best interests of the student body if Mr.
Goddard remained on the EC, perhaps it isn’t in his best interests.
It is easy to become discouraged; he lasted longer than most would.
So rather than blaming him for forsaking the public’s trust in him,
he should be thanked for doing as much as he did.

Thanks, Rick.

Responses to editorial outcry
E.C. member irritated at theft

The Nose, ’77

Blows

17 November 1977
Editor, Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:

I have read your newspaper
with great interest since I
played out my option and had to
retire from college journalism.
I still regret not being able to
write, edit and lay out the Phi,
the University’s grand and

glorious paper, which in these |

times of woe, could use some

~ help.

It did grieve my _ heart,
however, to see some interloper
abscond with the column I
founded, nurtured through the
hard times, and at last brought
out into the full light of day asa
full-grown, somewhat prickly,
gossip column.

I am speaking, sir, of the col-
umn “The Nose Knows,” which
has degenerated from a source
of little tidbits about people in
high places to a whining, snivel-
ing,~ constantly complaining
dung-heap of drivel and petty
bellyaching.

At the beginning of this year,
when you saw fit to farm my
column out to some other
writer, I objected. You put me
in my place by informing me
that I had no copyright, no pa-

_tent, and, therefore, no right to

keep my column from such
desecration.

I hope you now rue that deci-
sion. Your bush-league , writer
has proceeded to insult just
about everyone, libeled a few of
them, cost you a big chunk of
advertising, generally made a
first-class (southern end of a
north-bound mule) of himself
and prostituted my creation.

Now, in public, before all the
world, I ask that you never let
that bum write another column
for your paper, and that if he
does and you let him, that it
does not further ruin the once-
good name of my column. In
short, sir, cease and desist.

Sincerely,

Dear Editor:

When I chose to come to W&L
last spring, I was very much
looking forward to the Honor
System. Not only the Honor
System in relation to academics
but also in other respects. The
thought of leaving a book on a
table or my room unlocked and
not being worried with trivial
theft appealed to me.

It bothered me the first cou-
ple weeks of school when a pen
on the memo board of my dorm
door had been taken. But it was
extremely irritating when a
high school jacket disappeared
from the coat hall of the Com-
mons sometime between Sun-
day dinner (11-20) and Monday
breakfast. It seems to be a high
price to pay for forgetting my
coat after dinner.

The coat was an average dark
blue mylon jacket and had the

Great Seal of the United States
with the words ‘‘United States
Capitol Page”’ surrounding it on
the left breast. If someone pick-
ed the coat up, by mistake or
otherwise, I’d appreciate its .
return to the Commons with no
questions asked.

Of course I realize I could be
unjustly ragging on the school.
The thought of a townie being
responsible has crossed my
mind several times. But I just
can’t rule out the possibility
that a student could also be
responsible. I guess I’m just
sore because the jacket meant a
good deal to me. Maybe I have
some consolation in that the
W&L pin on the collar of the
jacket was lying on the floor
below where the jacket had
been hanging.

A little irrationally,
Steve Abraham ‘81

Although police presently
have no firm leads, Chief Kirby
said that law officials in
Albemarle County reported
locating several components of
stereo equipment although no
positive identification has link-
ed that equipment to the thefts
in Lexington.

Lt. Carl Emore of the police
department said W&L students
can practically expect break-
ins over the holiday recesses.
“I’d take everything of value
with me,”’ he said.

Last year, several student
housing break-ins also occurred
-during vacation periods
although over $3,000 of that
equipment was subsequently
recovered by the police depart-
ment. “Of course it took us a
long time to get a lead,’’ Chief
Kirby added.

Last year’s break-ins were
finally traced to a group of local
juveniles who, reportedly, were
freed after their arraignment
because of their age.

This year’s break-ins, similar
to those robberies of last year,
are also suspected to be the
work of a local gang.

Ring-tum Phi, Dec. 1, 1977, Page9

Catalogue “misleading” to students

by Ken Mastrilli

After careful reading of the
Washington and Lee catalogue
and Student Handbook by
members of the staff at the Ring-
tum Phi, we've determined that a
study into whether or not many of
the student organizations includ-
ed in these publications are ac-
tually viable and effective, or
merely just resume fillers for
future job applications. In an ef-
fort to examine and scrutinize the
efficiency and viability of various
student organizations on campus,
as well as determining whether or
not they should be included in the
Washington and Lee University
catalogue, the Ring-tum Phi will
present, in coming weeks, a series
of articles in an effort to k2ep
both student officers and ad-
ministrative officials on their
toes. Hopefully this investigation
will provoke student officials, as
well as administrators to carefully
reassess their responsibilities.
Administrators in charge of
editing and revising the material
contained in the catalogue will
hopefully be more careful not to
allow misleading information like
that concerning the Independent
Union, the subject of the Phi’s
first article, to get into the
catalogue.

The Independent Union, an
organization which is supposed
to sponsor intramural athletics

and social activies according to

&L’s' student catalogue and
handbook, has been defunct for
three years.

Dean of Students, Lewis G.
John, who is responsible for
editing the particular section of
the catalogue where the error
has appeared over the past
three years, said he hadn’t
notice that this information on
the Independent Union was still
being included in the catalogue.

“Grand inquisitor”’

as a copy of any physical
evidence to be used against him
during a trial. These sugges-
tions have also been _ in-
corporated into the honor
system white book. .

In striving for open govern-
ment,.Goddard was instrumen-
tal in seeing that the selection of
committee co-chairmen was
kept in open session, rather
than in executive session as
some EC members desired. He
also proposed accounting
guidelines to keep co-chairmen
from abusing student funds. He,
along with George Griffin was
responsible for seeing that par-
ties become public knowledge.

Goddard was also a strong ad-
vocate for the law school. He
was mainly responsible for the

$3,000 more from the EC than it
received last year.

Goddard was probably the
toughest examiner on the EC.
Never afraid to ask the tough
question, he was almost em-
barassingly candid at times.

Goddard told the Phi he
thinks he has done about all he
wanted to do this year, and it’s
about time someone else came
in and took over. He said he
believes several present
members of the EC have the
capacity to take over his job as
the “grand inquisitor.’’ At this
time it looks like the two most
likely candidates are Jackie
Borden and Mike Missal, but
Goddard mentioned that he
thinks freshman Chris Gam-
mon is coming along well, too.

John agreed that this in-
formation could be misleading
to a prospective student who
might read it and assume if he
came to W&L and decided not
to join a fraternity there was
always the Independent Union
to fall back on.

Dean John promised to edit
this section or change the wor-
ding. As it stands now, the
catalogue reads as follows:
‘‘Many Washington and Lee
men do not affiliate with frater-
nities. They may participate in
the activities of the Independent
Union, which, like the frater-
nities, sponsors intramural
athletic and social activities.”’

John said he might preface
the paragraph with “if there is
enough student interest,’ or
just take it out entirely until the
IU becomes a viable organiza-
tion again.

Dean John said that much of
the information in the catalogue
is reprinted each year without

‘much scrutiny. But after these

revelations he said he would be
a little more careful.

John said that the fluctuating
existence of the IU in past years
makes it hard to know whether
or not to include it in the
catalogue.

This year’s SAB co-chairman
Charlie Hulfish said the reason
the Independent Union was in-
cluded in this year’s handbook
can be attributed to former co-
chairmen Mike Armstrong and
John Berley. It seems that they
simply reprinted the same in-
formation that was in the
previous year’s edition instead
of examining its contents for
misleading information like
that on the Independent Union.

History

According to Ed Burgess,
WLUR news director and

former vice president of the IU,
the SAB took over the social
functions of the IU. And, since
anyone can get together an in-
dependent intramural athletic
team, the IU was left with no
real function to perform when it
disbanded in 1974.

Ed Burgess was able to offer
the Phi some very interesting
reasons for the IU’s demise.
Back in 1974, according to
Burgess, a brief revival of the
IU was attempted under the
leadership of Robert
Piedrahita, who has since
graduated. Burgess said that
Piedrahita thought the IU could
be run on a total budget of $1.48
and deemed Piedrahita’s

leadership as ‘“‘totally ineffec-
tive.’’

Attempts at forming a bridge
club, chess club, and ping pong
team, along with other sports
and social activities, failed
miserably due to lack of funds
and student apathy, according
to Brugess, despite the fact that
at the time more than 35 per
cent of the student body con-
sidered themselves _in-
dependents.

Considering the fact that
most students can go to a frater-
nity party without too much
hassle. the social function of an
Independent Union was
destroyed, said Burgess, in
response to whether or not he
thought the IU could make a
comeback at W&L. “As for
athletics, the rules have been
altered so that independents
can organize a team under their
own power withoug having to
come to an independent union
for its help,”’ he said.

Burgess noted that another
big problem is trying to procure
funds or membership dues from
an apathetic student body. He
also said that the words
““independent”’ and “‘union’’ are
almost contradictory, which
may explain the problems the
IU has encountered in legitimiz-
ing itself on campus.

Most independents are in-
dependent because that’s the
way they’ve decided to spend
their four years here, he com-
mented. He said that many of
the independents were not in-
terested in joining the IU for the
same reasons that they didn’t
want to join a fraternity. They
just didn’t care to be associated
with any group, he said.
Burgess said that most of the
people he came into contact
with as IU vice president were
somewhat anti-social _ in-
dividuals to begin with; adverse
to any kind of association with
anybody. Also the fact that the
IU had no power to collect dues
from independents made it very
hard to organize and pay for
parties and mixers, which
might have helped legitimize
the IU, he said.

Since the SAB has taken over
the responsibilities of the IU, at
least in a literal sense, many
students feel that the SAB is not
servicing the 35-40 per cent of
the student population known as
independents as well as they
should be. Lee Howard, former
IU member, says that instead of

Atwood dignifies house |Notice

(continued from page 3)

The house is one of four
neoclassical residences built on
the front campus as part of the
college’s 1841-42 building pro-
gram. The Lee-Jackson
restoration was paid for
through a substantial gift from
an anonymous benefactor and a
grant from the National
Historic Landmarks Commis-
sion.

The university plans to
restore the three other pre-Civil
War front-campus faculty
residences as soon as gift funds
are available. The restorations
are part of W&L’s ongoing
development program for the
decade of the 1970s.

Although the identity of the
architect is not know, ‘The Ar-

chitecture of Historic Lex-
ington,’’ just published by the
University Press of Virginia,
says the front-campus houses
are characterized by ‘‘the quali-
ty of the design and the im-
pressive architectural composi-
tion.”

The entire front campus at
Washington and Lee, including
the Lee-Jackson and the other
houses, is a National Historic
Landmark, the highest recogni-
tion the federal government can
give a private site. At the time it
announced the designation, the
Interior Department described
W&L’s as “one of the most
dignified and beautiful college
campuses in the nation.”’

Poly-scientists to meet

Political science instructors
from around Virginia will meet
in Lexington Saturday for the
annual Conference of Virginia

Highlight of the conference,
for which both Washington and
Lee University and Virginia

be a keynote address by a
counselor to former President
Ford.

John O. Marsh Jr., a 1951,
W&L law school graduate, will

speak on “The Ford-Carter

Editorial reprinted with per-
mission of Hollins Columns

The first whispers about it
flowed through the dining room
grapevine and stories of its
outlandish comments were
often dismissed in minds as
gossip-down views. But when
xeroxed copies of the W&L
Ring-tum Phi editorial,
‘Season Opens’’ (or the ‘rack-
date’ editorial as it is referred
to at W&L) were posted on
campus bulletin boards and
doors, the most colorful rumors
proved to be true.

Quite a few women saw the
editorial as a joke, a satiriza-
tion of the social scene for both
women and men. That may
have been its initial intent. The
editorial is so poorly written
satirically, however, that our
advice to author ‘‘jmg’’ is to
study Benjamin Franklin or
Ring Lardner.

For the majority of the
students, though, the blatant
discount of women, regardless

of the editorial’s point, showed '

through.

Not only did the title allude to
a hunt, but the whole imagery of
the piece was such that we were
the hunted and W&L ‘‘men”’
were about to embark on this
great expedition: ‘We have
been blessed with unusual luck
this year.’’ “Good Luck! Ex-
perience is the best teacher...’’

Yet the fatal mistake the
Ring-tum Phi made was

U.C. MEETING

will be for this year.

Pre-calc course to be considered

by Randy Smith

Whether or not the Math
Department will offer a pre-
calculus course, and the future
fate of the University Council
will be two of the topics of
debate at this afternoon’s U.C.
meeting.

Students initiated questions
about a pre-calculus course at
last month’s meeting, but
discussion was scheduled for
this month because no
representative of the
Mathematics Department was
present. It is expected that
students will question the seem-
ing reluctance of the Math
Department to institute a pre-
calculus course, even when
‘“‘many’”’ students feel the need
of one.

Also up for consideration and
debate is a motion introduced
by Professor Sessions at the
close of last month’s meeting.
The motion reads in part: ‘“‘The
University Council will meet
when (and only when) called by
both of the co-chairmen upon
the request either of the Presi-
dent of the University or of at
least six Council members...’’

Prof. Sessions said that his
reason for submitting the mo-
tion was to instigate some
“‘serious self study.’’ His resolu-
tion would ensure that there
were “important things worth
talking about, instead of trivial
issues.” He also hopes that it
would prompt advocates for
various issues, as opposed to
the current system which
seems to force individuals to
‘talk off the top of their heads.’’

Professor Goldsten has
already provided some opposi-
tion to Sessions’ proposal. He
views the University Council as

a “communications insurance

not be closed down for any
reason. Goldsten maintains that
there are many vital issues in-
volving the entire University
community which have yet to

also caught three passes in the
win.

After an 0-6 start this fall
complicated by numerous key
injuries, the Generals rebound-
ed to win three of their final five
ball games. When one looks
back on the season, it becomes
apparent that if two one point
losses (Centre and Emory &
Henry) would have gone W&L’s
way, and one of two games that
could have gone either way
{Randolph-Macon and _ Lock
Haven) went the Generals’
way, the team could have just
as easily been 6-5 as 3-8. A two
point conversion in the E&L
game would have given the
Generals a tie for second place
in the ODAC rather than a
fourth place finish.

The 1978 football Generals
will open the season against the
James Madison Dukes in Har-
risonburg, and return home the
following weekend to host
Davidson College. The com-
plete 1978 schedule follows: 9-9

The University Council will
meet on Thursday afternoon,
December 1, 1977 at 4:30 in the
Student Executive Committee
Room of the University Center.

In addition to the routine
minutes of the faculty commit-

agenda for this meeting: (1) the
possible need for a pre-calculus
mathematics course, with
discussion to be held with
representatives of our Depart-
ment of Mathematics; (2) the
following motion of Professor
Sessions which has been held
over from the last meeting:

“The University Council will
meet when (and only when)
called by both of the co-

Police Policy Challenged by Phi

times the public is to be the
beneficiary of any action taken
at any level of government.”
City Council Roberts said that
his advice to Chief Kirby in sup-
port of the police secrecy on ar-
rests and summonses is under
“an exception” to the Freedom
of Information Act which he in-
terprets as permitting police
and sheriffs to arbitrarily
withhold all arrest records.
Roberts said that it is not
necessary for Chief Kriby or his
office to give specific reasons or
rationals for withholding any
records, but that they need only
cite the number of the statute.
One of the statutes cited by
Roberts is Section 2.1-342, part
of the Freedom of Information
Act. It reads in part: ‘‘All of-
ficial records shall be open to
inspection and copying by any
citizen of this State...Access to
such records shall not be denied
to any such citizen of this State,
nor to representatives of
newspapers and magazines
with circulation in this State.’’
“Official records’ are
specifically defined by Section
2.1-341(b) of the Virginia
Freedom of Information Actas:
‘* ,.All written or printed books,
papers, letters,
documents...reports or other

materials, regardless of
physical form or
characteristics, made and

received in pursuance of law by
the public officers of the State
and its counties, municipalities
and subdivisions of government
in the transaction of public
business.”’

Roberts rejected’ the
language of the Act that ‘any
exception or exemption from
applicability shall be narrowly
construed in order that no thing
which should be public way be
hidden from any person.”’

The City Attorney also re-
jected the view of Virginia At-

-torney General Anthony F.

Troy, as expressed in an ad-
dress given by him on June 3rd
of this year, that ‘“‘theofficial
records subject to public in-
spection include virtually every
type of record, report, or cor-
respondence held in the files of
governmental bodies or agen-
cies, if the record relates in any
manner to the official function
or business of the governmental
body or agency.”

Roberts called the Attorney
General’s comments ‘‘just a
speech,’’ and said that they
were not ‘an official opinion.”
He declared that, as he reads
the law, “arrest records” are
covered by the exe tions that
permit public officials to

withhold certain types of
specific records.
In particular, Roberts

specified ‘‘complaints”’ as ex-
empted from public disclosure.
Under his_ interpretation,
Roberts conceded _ that
“complaint, as definted (by
Roberts), covers most
categories’’ of records main-

tained by the police depart-
ment.

Roberts also cited Section
15.1-135.1, a statute pertaining
to the records kept by chiefs of
police, which appears to be in
conflict with the expressed writ-
ten intent of the Freedom of In-
formation Act.

It charges police chiefs with a
duty to protect and preserve all
records that they are required
to gather under law. The last
sentence of the statute reads:

“The records required to be
maintained by this section shall
be exempt from the previsions
of Chapter 21 (Section 2.1-340 to
2.1-346) of Title 2.1 of the Code of
Virginia.’’ This final provision
applies solely to the Freedom of
Information Act.

“The way I interpret the law,
the City has the authority to
withhold these records, it
doesn’t have to give a reason for
its actions except that is the
way it wants to do business,”’
Roberts said.

shooting 55.5 per cent in the first
half suddenly went cold, only
managing to hit on 40 per cent of
their shots in the second half.

York gained the lead for the
first time with six minutes to
play, 78-77. The lead then see-
sawed until Bortner put the
Spartans on top for good, 90-89,
with 1:02 remaining. He then
scored York’s last seven points
to seal the Generals’ doom.

The most outstanding per-
formance by a General was un-
doubtedly Mike Wenke’s. He
made 10 of 16 field goal at-
tempts for 21 points while set-
ting a W&L assist record with
17. Wenke, who rarely scored in
double figures in the past two
years, is being worked into the
offense this year and should
continue to score well.

Wenke shared high point man
honors with Larry Meyer, a
sophomore forward starting for .
the first time this year. Meyer
also had eight rebounds to go
along with his 21 points.

Other Generals scoring in
double figures were Pat Dennis,
with 19 and Bruce Williams,
with 14.

Ardith Collins shared top re-
bounding honors with Dave
Leunig. Unfortunately, Leunig
fouled out early in the second
half, putting most of the reboun-
ding pressure on Collins.

Canfield said he hopes the
team will use this game as a
lesson. He said many teams
which are only average teams
will be gunning for the Generals
when they find out the Generals
were ranked number 4 national-
ly in Division III. Canfield said
he thought he noticed an im-
plicit attitude during half time
which indicated that players
were more interested in how
many points they were going te
score than concerned about
winning the game. He said he
thought the players took their
opposition too lightly after
building up the 19 point half
time lead.

He said the players had
already held a team meeting to
talk over the game and make
sure a_ similar occurence
doesn’t happen again. Canfield
said he did not request the team
meeting; the players held one
on their own.

The Generals certainly did
not need a team meeting after
beating Clinch Valley, unless it
was to congratulate themselves
on how well they played. The
Generals had only a 44-37 half
time lead, but came out in the
second half to shoot 61 per cent
from the field and score 64
points. The 108 points they put
on the score board were the
most since back to back vic-
tories over Shenandoah, 112-77,
and Virginia Wesleyan, 109-77,
the past year.

Top scorer for the Generals
was Dennis, with 23. Wenke had
17 points, while shooting with 75
per cent accuracy and handing
out 13 assists.

Other Generals in double
figures were Leunig, with 14
and Collins and Williams, each
with 12. Collins also lead the
team with 11 rebounds.

Latest development: Pressure
brought on the City of Lexington
by the Ring-tum Phi has caused
Mayor Charles Phillips to order
the city attorney to draw up new
guidelines with respect to the
release of police information to
the press. These guidelines will
comply with the voluntary
guidelines set down by the
Virginia Press Association and
will go into effect today, Phillips
said.

by Randolph P. Smith

City Attorney William O.
Roberts offered a Virginia At-
torney General’s opinion con-
cerning the maintenance of
records by law enforcement
agencies as the legal justifica-
tion for the Lexington Police
Department’s policy of refusing
to release the names of persons
arrested or issued court sum-
monses.

The March 2, 1976, opinion
discusses a_ statute which
charges sheriffs and chiefs of
police with the duty to ‘“main-

 

in Niain__certain records,” and

 

VOLUME LXXVII

specifies that those records are
exempt from the Freedom of In-
formation Act.

Roberts cited the Attorney
General’s opinion in response to
the Ring-tum Phi’s formal
challenge of the Police Depart-
ment’s policy of denying access
to the general public and press
information relating to arrest
records and summonses until
such time as they have been
entered on the court record.

J. Michael Gallagher, editor
of the Ring-tum Phi, said that
the Attorney General’s opinion
cited by Roberts was not “ap-
plicable”’ to the situation being
challenged. He explained that
by his interpretation of the opi-
nion, the records referred to are
“internal record,’’ such as in-
vestigative reports and ar-
resting officer’s reports.
“Those are not the arrest
records to which we feel we are
entitled access.”’

The Ring-tum Phi has refer-
red Attorney Roberts to two

other Attorney Generals’ opi-
nions. One opinion requires
“warrant”? and “‘arrest’’
records to be disclosed public-
ly; the other opens a sheriff’s
jail book to the public.

When confronted with a sum-
mary of a July 21, 1971, At-
torney General’s opinion from
the Civil Digest, which states
that ‘“‘warrant’”’ and “‘arrest”’
records are “official records
subject to disclosure re-
quirements,” Roberts said that
he would have to see the full opi-
nion. (The official opinion was
not available to theRing-tum
Phi.)

In the Attorney General’s jail
book opinion, such information
as name, color of eyes, age, sex,
charge and trail date—as in-
cluded in a county sheriff's jail
book—was viewed as part of an
“official record’? and was,
therefore, covered under the re-
quirement for public disclosure
by the Freedom of Information
Act.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, DECEMBER 8, 1977

NUMBER 12

New law threatens campus music

by Galen Trussell

A new copyright law to take
effect the beginning of next
year threatens to stifle all
musical entertainment at
Washington and Lee.

The new law will require col-
leges and universities to pay
royalties for any source of
music played on their campus.
The royalty payments would in-
clude fraternity combo parties,
and any musical entertainment
the Student Acitvities Board or
the Cockpit could provide.

As a result of this new law,
University Center Director,
Mike Cappeto suggested that all
organizations involved in book-
ing musical acts refrain from
doing so until the beginning of
next year. Cappeto said that
W&L can only wait and see
what developes, and thereby
avoid being one of the early test
cases for the new law. Cappeto
suggested that there would be a
large number of test cases with
the larger universities before a
clear rule for university enter-
tainment is adopted by the
various copyright companies.

According to Gary English,
executive director of the Na-
tional Entertainment and Cam-
pus Activities Association, the
effect of the new law could be
devastating, and _ royalty
payments could total up to half
of the college’s entertainment
budgets. He added that a lot of
musicians would be losing work
because of the law and that a lot
of concert schedules would have
to be revamped.

The alternatives to paying the
royalty fee are singularly unat-
tractive. If a college allows an

unlicensed performer to play on

-its campus without paying the

fees it can be subject to court
action and fines. Each time a
piece of music is performed in
public without the permission of
the copyright holder the college
is subject to a $250 fine. The on-
ly other alternative to not pay-
ing a fee or a fine would be for
the schools to hire performers
who perform only older classics
for which the 75 year copyright
has expired.

Almost all royalty fees for
performers are collected by

three royalty companies here in
the U. S. These companies are

posers, Authors, and Publishers

would cover all musical enter-
tainment except big concerts.
The rate BMI mentioned was 10
cents per student per year to be
paid to all three of the royalty
agencies. If this plan were
adopted it would mean an addi-

City responds to RtP complaints

Roberts said that the sheriff’s
jail book does not apply to Lex-
ington Police Chief James A.
Kirby’s jurisdiction, since the
sheriff is part of the county’s
government. Roberts explained
that if a person is arrested by
the city police, he is in-
carcerated in the county jail,
which is outside of Kirby’s
jurisdiction.

In response, City Counsel
Roberts cited an Attorney
General’s opinion pertaining to
records maintained by chiefs of
police. The opinion is in
reference to Section 15.1-135.1, a
statute which charges police
chiefs with the duty to protect
and preserve all records they
are required to gather under
law

Specifically, ‘‘arrest
records” and “investigative
records” are defined in the opi-
nion as “public records.’’ The
opinion reads in part: “Such
records, however, apart from

tention that Roberts is applying
the statute’s definition of ‘‘ar-
rest recor
that ‘‘any exception or exemp-
tion from applicability’ should
be “narrowly construed,” as
provided in the Freedom of In-

also asserts that the Attorney
General’s opinions it cites, sup-

disclosure of names and ‘‘other

“The law is given an aura
that disguises its real purpose.
It does its dirty work day in and
day out,” William Kunstler,
nationally-famous defense
lawyer said Thursday at Lee
Chapel.

William Kunstler has become
prominent by making a career
of defending the so-called
revolutionaries of American
society. His lecture on the
dangers of the legal system was
part of the Contact ‘78 Sym-
posium.

Dressed in a fashinable three-
piece suit, Kunstler looked
every bit like a highly-paid
lawyer from an_ established
firm in New York City. But
Kunstler’s legal battles take
him far from New York, and his
clients are not the type that can
afford large fees.

to SAB records. He also said the

(continued on page 7)

nf

«Kunstler’s life and professional
outlook took a new course from
that moment on.

Since then some of his cases
have had him as a negotiator
for the Sioux Indians at Wound-
ed Knee, S. D., representing
prisoners at the Attica upris-
ings in 1971 and representing
students at the Kent State

shootings of 1970.

“I’ve learned a lot about the
legal profession,”’ he said, “I
fear, distrust and hate the law,
but I understand what it is and
what it does.”’

Quoting from Charles Reich’s
“The Greening of America,”
Kunstler referred to the law as
“the control mechanism of the
corporate state.’’ The society
creates a mechanism to deal
with the individuals society
fears most, he said. These in-
dividuals are called ‘‘revolu-
tionaries,” and every genera-
tion has them.

“These so-called revolu-
tionaries are being screwed by
the legal system, and I try to do
my part to help them fight
back,”’ he said.

The way that the system con-
trols these revolutionaries is by
the political trial. Kunstler said
that the trial of Jesus was a
perfect example of a successful
political trial. He was a revolu-
tionary who threatened the
system. The system responded
by getting rid of the revolu-
tionary voice and frightening
his followers. The final phase of
the political trial is to unite the
silent majority against the
revolutionary.

The peace movement of
1965-1972 was a time when the
government attempted to use
political trials to subvert the
ideas of the revolutionaries that
were protesting the war,

Ever wonder who gets all
those scholarships listed in the
back of your catalogue? The
Phi asked Financial Aid direc-
tor Van H. Pate and here’s what
hehadtosay: —

“T’d like to have that listing of
endowments and scholarships
taken out of the catalogue
because it’s misleading,’ said
Van H. Pate last week in a Ring-
tum Phi interview.

Pate, who is financial aid
director at W&L, said that
many prospective students call
him up and ask how to apply for
the scholarships listed in the
back of the catalogue, only to
find that there’s no application
needed.

“Except for a very few, all

U.C. votes

by Randy Smith
The University Council voted
overwhelmingly, last Thurs-
day, to recommend to the
Mathematics Department that
a pre-calculus course not be of-
fered at Washington and Lee.

The recommendation came
after almost an hour of wide-
ranging debate about the nature
of ‘“‘pre-calculus”’ courses and
their purpose in the curriculum.

Dean Lewis G. John, co-
chairman of the U.C., gave a
brief background summary of
the pre-calculus controversy,
and paraphrased Dr. Edgar W.
Spencer’s position. Dr. Spencer,
a professor in the Geology
Department, maintains that a
pre-calculus course might be
helpful for students not major-
ing in mathematics, who need a
sounder basis before taking
Math 101. (Calculus is the
lowest level math course of-
fered at W&L.)

Dr. R. S. Johnson, head of the
Mathematics Department, of-
fered a two-page memoranda
expressing his Department’s
position. Dr. Johnson said, “I
can’t define what pre-calculus

back of the catalogue are
distributed on the basis of finan-
cial need,” Pate explained.
“Those scholarship monies are
pooled together and are the
total source of funds for all
grants given by the University
committee on financial aid, he
said.

According to Pate, the com-
mittee sometimes gives out
more than is bequeathed by the
donors. ‘‘But what is important
is that all the money is spent,”’
said Pate. “Even if there is not
someone that meets the specific
requirements of the scholar-
ship, we still give out the money
in the form of financial aid to so-
meone. For instance, we have a
pre-ministerial scholarship to
help other students,” said Pate.

Pate noted that the best part
about the scholarship fund is
that it makes possible for W&L
to avoid having to take money
from its operating expenses to

pay for financial aid.
“Therefore, in theory and in
practice,” said Pate, ‘‘the

money that one student pays for
his tuition is never used to pay
for another student’s tuition.
When asked about the fact
that many of the scholarships
listed specify a preference to a

misleading

worthy student from a par-
ticular state, Pate said that the
Financial Aid Committee might
give a student from Virginia
part of the Bathe county
scholarship for worthy students
from that area if he is eligible.

Scholarship recipients are no
longer listed in the catalogue or
in the back of graduation pro-
grams because of the Buckley
Act which insures the privacy of
school records, and personal
discretion on the part of the
Financial Aid Committee. “We
thought by publishing the
names we were infringing upon
the privacy of the individual in-
volved, infringements which
are not allowed under the provi-
sion of the Buckley privacy
act,” said Pate.

Pate said he has been pushing
for years to stop publication of
scholarship recipients’ names
because, as he put it, ‘‘the whole
school doesn’t need to know who
is on financial aid, at least
publicly.”

Pate agreed that since the
scholarships are not awarded
as stated in the catalogue, they
should be taken out and in their
place a statement should be in-
serted describing how the
money is actually distributed.

down pre-calc course

is,’ and noted that there is no
agreement on what such a
course should cover. The Math
Department feels that students
entering Washington and Lee
have had enough mathematics
to move onto calculus.

The proposal was made that a
pre-calculus course be offered
as a means of encouraging
“arts” students to try math.
But the question was raised as
to the purpose such a course
would serve: ‘‘Are we asking
the Mathematics Department
to offer a non-math course?”’

Dr. Johnson countered with
results of “various” studies
which show that most pre-
calculus students do not move
on to more advanced math
courses.

These results prompted the
suggestion for a ‘connected
course,” tying a pre-calculus to
a calculus course in order to get
any credits. The suggestion was

also made for a “‘workbook”’ to
be compiled by the Math
Department to provide in-

terested students with the
mathematical rudiments for
calculus. Dr. Johnson stated
that such a ‘‘workbook’’
already existed.

After approximately an
hour’s worth of discussion, a
motion was made to recom-
mend to the Mathematics
Department that a pre-calculus
course not be offered. The mo-
tion passed 19-0, with 3 absten-
tions.

Arguments were made for a
more unified faculty policy in
regard to independent Ex-
aminations. Specifically,
discussion centered on the wide
variance of exam administra-
tion by the faculty and the con-
fusion it causes.

Discussion of Professor W. L.
Sessions’ motion to limit U.C.
meetings was tabled until the
next session on Thursday,

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s Christmas Candlelight
Service will take place today in
the Robert E. Lee Memorial
Episcopal Church.

The service, nine lessons with
carols, is an ancient form of ser-
vice for corporate worship at
Christmas time. The series of
lessons tells the story of sacred
history from the Creation of
Man to the Incarnation.

It was first revived for
modern use at Truro in Corn-
wall during the 19th century. It
is broadcast each year from
King’s College Chapel in Cam-
bridge and is widely used both
in England and the United
States.

The carols will be sung by the]
Washington and Lee Glee Club,
under the direction of Dr. Gor-
don Spice, and the Mary

James Tucker Cook.

The lessons will be read by
members of the W&L com-
munity, including Pamela

William Lad Sessions, Andrew
W. McThenia, Edward Craun,
John M. Gunn Jr., Andrew H.

In your pit:

Dave Van Ronk tonight!

by Galen Trussell

Go see Dave Van Ronk.

If you never see another act in
the Cockpit you should see Van
Ronk for the simple reason that
he is the best entertainment
that the Cockpit will feature this
year.

There will be two shows
tonight, and there will be no
cover charge for students who
have paid their activities fee.

A class entertainer deserves
a class audience. Please come
to listen not to be rowdy. People
who are rowdy or obnoxious in
the Cockpit in the future will be
subject to punishment by the
Student Control Committee.

Van Ronk comes to us direct
from an engagement at the
Cellar Door in D. C. He per-
formed in Washington earlier
this year.The Washington Post
had this to say about him: ‘‘Van
Ronk is irrepresible, a one-of-a-
kind performer who shows no
signs of running out of steam.”
Rolling Stone credits Van Ronk
for ‘‘almost single-handedly in-
troducing rural blues to the folk
movement.’’Rolling Stone also
calls Van Ronk one of the most
influential blues performers of
his generation. Musicans News
says “Dave Van Ronk has
always had the voice nobody
can challenge.’’ Advocate
magazine-wrote that Van
Ronk’s guitar picking is “‘as ac-
coustic as can be, clear and
relaxed, like slow bubbling spr-
ing water.’’ Lastly, Previewer

With the end of the semester

The SAB had a_ good

everyone came clean. The
Music Union came very clean.
Anyone that can spend their en-
tire budget in one and a half
months deserves some credit.
The SAB As You Like It was a
farce, playing to a crowd of only
100 is not easy. Certain
members of the English
Department were there. After
doing some heavy petting with
their lady friends (for which
they got nasty looks from Dean
Diddle) they decided to leave at
intermission.

A certain admissions person

switch considering she had
them hawking programs at last
years lacrosse games. Speaking
of lacrosse did you know you
have to be invited to go out for
lacrosse? That’s funny I
though sports were open to
anyone who was qualified. Prof.
Latture was at As You Like It,
just like he’s at everything.
How does he do it? Some say
there’s more than one of him.

We heard an interesting story
about him. It seems that when it
came time to build the new
library the access to the back
campus (Howe, duPont and
Parmly) was going to be closed
the big ‘‘H’’ called VMI and ask-
ed permission to build an access
road behind the Marshall
Library to Howe Hall. VMI said
‘“‘No way!’’ Such a small favor,
but no way. The university was
at a loss. Parsons started grow-
ing a beard. Prof. Latture step-
ped in and said he remembered
back in 1919 (I believe) W&L
built Letcher Ave. Sure enough
when the university checked

their records, they found out
they owned Letcher Ave.! The
big “H” called VMI and said
something to the effect that the
next person who stepped on Let-
cher Ave. was gonna get a taste
of W&L ROTC. Isn’t it a nice
road we have behind VMI?

Carole C. made her first ap-
pearance at an EC meeting. She
was wearing a coordinating out-
fit with our little friend. Jerry
D. was there also, but without
the Emmers, McFaddens,
Kozaks and Joneses. (A first—
Julia must of missed that). Dan
Scott was there trying to defend
his coup. I thought students
were supposed to be running
things (i.e. Galen T.).

A certain dorm counselor
leaves us. No one will notice
since he can recite the TV paper
word for word.

A certain Phi Kapp from
Wisconsin sent the Phi his
Christmas list just in case
anyone is interested.

There’s word the pitter patter

around Washington Hall in
several months.

Entertainment Editor

Sponsored by the Student Ac-
tivities Board, Washington and
Lee received a visit from the
National Shakespeare Com-
pany last Sunday night. This
group is on tour 9 months out of
every ear, bringing live
Shakespearian performances
into areas which normally
would not experience them.
Their last performance was in
1974, when the same comedy
was presented. And, in spite of
the all too near exam drive,
over 150 souls ventured into the
night air, for what many hoped
would be an enjoyable return to
the great bard’s works.

Unfortunately, it is here—in
the word ‘‘return’’—that the
company seemed to have its ,
greatest flaw, at least in the
minds of Sunday night’s au-
dience. The Company’s sworn
duty seems to be that of
popularizing Shakespeare, and
as a result, they attempt to
make him ‘‘relevant’’ to
modern times. Evidently, most
of their work is done with au-
diences who have been brain-
washed into thinking that
Shakespeare, because he is of
classic repute, is also ‘‘dull.”’
And, in trying to fend off that
boring reputation, they
transform the play into a
burlesqe variation on
Shakespeare!

This may work very well in
breaking in new followers of
Shakespeare, but those people
who took the trouble on this 4
campus to see the show already 3
had some exposure and ap- *
preciation for the genuine thing. 2
In short, we didn,t need to be %
“sold” atall. a

So one should view this per=
formance by realizing that the '
Company was taking great
liberties with the
Shakespearian script, in order
to entice the laughter that no
doubt greeted the original in
1600. In this respect, they
succeeded—a limited success
certainly, but a success all the
same. And only those . un- _
fortunates who have known the

  

beauty of the play in its original
state have a right to be
disgruntled and somewhat let-
down.

In spite of their free style,
though, the group is immensely
talented and personable. Even
Richard Phillips, who played
both the good and bad Dukes
(the former as a poor man’s
Burl Ives; the latter vaguely
reminiscent of Mayor Daley in
his declining years) won the
sympathy of the generally
young audience. Certain inter-
changes were very memorable.
Rodney Clark’s ‘‘All the world’s
a Stage’’ soliloquy was perform-
ed with a wonderful balance of
delicacy and irony. And Alison
Edwards as Rosalind deserves

special plaudits as | the

headstrong heroine.

As You Like It is a strangely
apt title for the type of presenta-
tion viewed last Sunday. For
truly, if you could accept the
Forest of Arden as a refuge for
latter-day flower children, and
a disco number instead of the
usual Elizabethan wedding
dance which closes the show,
you should have enjoyed it. The
SAB certainly deserves thanks
for bringing a live theatre per-
formance to W&L free of
charge. And, for those who were
truly offended by the show,
keep in mind how easily you
really did escape; this Com-
pany also does Taming of the

Flat Generals manage to
roll over Rochester, 89-71

by Ken Mastrilli

Despite 28 turnovers and a
sluggish, error-filled first half,
the W&L Generals defeated the
University of Rochester Yellow
Jackets 89-71 in basketball ac-
tion Wednesday night at
Warner Center.

W&L wrestler pin defeat
on Lynchburg, Madison

The Wrestling Generals got
their season off to a fine start
this weekend, performing ad-
mirably in the second annual
Washington and Lee Invita-
tional on December 3, while
crushing conference rival Lyn-
chburg 34-3 on November 30,
and winning a closely contested
match against James Madison
University this past Tuesday,
20-16.

The winning week began
when the Generals traveled to
Lynchburg to begin the defense
of their ODAC crown. In a lop-
sided match W&L came out vic-
torious in nine of the ten weight
divisions, losing only a close
match at 167 lbs. The Generals
were led by tri-captain Ed
Rogers(150) and junior Jim
Flippen(158), both of whom
registered pins, and senior
heavyweight Ollie Mowry who
posted a convincing 10-1 ver-
dict.

“Ollie sure looked good
tonight,” said a jubilant Rogers
following the match.’ If we get
efforts such as that from him all
year this will be one tough
wrestling team.”’

This past Saturday the
Generals hosted their second
annual invitational, placing an
impressive fourth place finish,
up a notch from last year. Again
it was Rogers who teamed up
with sophomore Ray Gross(142)
to led the team, being the only

two Generals to take home first

place hardware.

The third seeded Rogers had
a relatively easy time of it . win-
ning all three of his matches by
a combined score of 35-6, in-
cluding an amazing 12-0 victory
over Liberty Baptist’s William
Brooks in the finals. Gross, who
entered the tournament as the
third seed at 142, had a rougher
time than the Generals’ highly
touted captain, although the
results were the same. After
beating his first round opponent
2-1, Ray found himself trailing
by three points in the second
round when he neatly took down
his man and registered a quick
pin. Then in the finals he won a
narrow 6-5 decision over Stu
Freeman of York College. The
match was not as close as the
score indicates, as Ray gave
away two points in the end to in-
sure his victory.

Freshman Dave Stoeffel also
put on an impressive showing
for the Generals at 167 lbs.,
placing third in the tournament
while registering the first two
victories of his varsity carreer.
The tournament was won by a
strong Clemson team, coached
by two time NCAA champion
Wade Schalles, who was follow-
ed by York, George Mason,
Washington and Lee, last year’s
champion, Liberty Baptist,
VMI, Maryville, and James
Madison.

VMI swimmers

W&L swimmers captured ten
out of twelve possible first
places and crushed VMI last
Tuesday, 64-49. The Generals’
victory was highlighted by
several record breaking efforts,
particularly those of Peter
Meem.

Meem turned in a career high
on his leg of the medley relay
and propelled his relay team-
mates, Howard Pillsbury, Scott
Duff and Bob Newcomb, to a
first place finish with a 34:07
time.

_  Meem also captured two in-
dividual firsts. He came within
a hundredth of a second of set-
ting a school record, but his
2:07.21 was good enough for a
first in the 200 yd. individual
medley. Meem turned in an ex-
cellent time in the 200 yd. breast
stroke for another first.

Chip Hoke also had a good
evening at VMI as he took two
first places. He won the 200 yd.
backstroke, and swam the 1000
yd. freestyle in 10:23, a pool

record at VMI.

W&L had only one entry in
the 200 yd. freestyle, but that
was all the Generals needed for
a first place finish, as Romich
finished in 1:48.8. He also finish-
ed second to VMI’s Cafferill in
the 100 yd. freestyle. Cafferill
edged Newcomb for VMI’s only
other first place finish in the 50
yd. freestyle.

General John Hudson clipped
4: 48.3 in the 500 yd. freestyle for
a first place, and the third best
finish for that event in Division
III this year. Drew Pillsbury
clocked a 2:10.8 200 yd. butterf-
ly for yet another W&L first.

In the diving competition
freshmen Jay Diesing and
George Irvine placed first and
second respectively in both the
one meter and three meter div-
ing co etition. Coach Bill
Stearns was pressed to
remember the last time two
W&L divers had accomplished
that feat. Stearns commented
that Meem ‘“‘probably had the
best day swimming of his life.’’

In what was an obvious let-
down after the Generals’
sparkling victory over Lyn-
chburg College Saturday night,
W&L’s roundballers blew leads
of 10 and 15 points during the
first half, while giving up the
ball 20 times and were only
ahead 35-32 over a team which
started four freshmen and a
junior.

The second half saw the
Generals come out and score 53
points, but their defense still
left a lot to be desired. The ex-
ception was Dave Luenig, who
played exceptionally at both
ends of the court. He along with
Pat Dennis shared the high
scoring honors with 18 points
apiece.

Mike Wenke, despite dishing

out 14 assists and scoring 17
points, had problems handling
the ball throughout the first
half.

Long jump shots by All-
American candidate Dennis
along with consistent shooting
by Larry Meyers got the
Generals off to a 23-8 lead over
the hapless Yellow Jackets who
appeared to have problems just
holding on to the ball. But tur-
novers led to 10 straight
unanswered points. by
Rochester, eight by the Yellow
Jackets’ Ryan Russell who end-
ed up as the game’s leading
scorer with 22. This kept the in-
domitable men from upstate
New York close at the half. .

The fact that they were still
close at the half prompted
Rochester coach and. former
W&L basketball star Mike Neer
to characterize his team’s ef-
forts as its best of the year. ‘‘Of
course the refereeing didn’t
help us,” he said, referring to
the crucial third quarter when
he was slapped with two two-
shot technical fouls at the same
time.

After Wenke sank the four
free throws the Generals got the
ball out of bounds and -im-
mediately put it in the hoop for
a six point play.

Wenke’s alley-oop pass to the
sky-high Bruce Williams under
(or should I say over) the
basket sealed the Yellow
Jackets’ fate, as the Generals’
lead ballooned to 17 points with
5:47 left in the game.

The Yellow Jackets hustling,
but inept, play was very much
in contrast to the lethargic play
of the Generals. Coach Can-
field, ever the optimist, had a
very different outlook on the
game. ‘‘When you can turn the

This week the Phi has ac-
quired the services of a former
local bookmaker who nearly
went into bankruptcy two years
ago for taking too many bets.
His name_ shall _ remain
anonymous because his
enemies are still looking for
him. Today, he will preview this
weekend’s big game in the ‘Na-
tional Football League. If his
predictions turn out to be
wrong, you’ll see why bookmak-
ing almost proved to be a fatal
occupation for him.

Detroit (5-7) at Baltimore
(9-2): The Lions have not won
on the road this year, losing six
straight. The Colts will win
their sixth straight at home
because they have to win in
order to stay tied with Miami in
the AFC East. Also, Bert Jones
will get a golden opportunity to
burn the Lions with many
touchdown passes because
Detroit habitually blitzes at the
wrong time. Loof for Baltimore
to breeze by 31-14.

Green Bay (3-9) at Chicago
(7-5): The Bears have a golden
opportunity to make the
playoffs for the first time since
they beat the Giants 14-10 for
the NFL championship in 1963.
The Bears won’t blow this one

 

against the low-scoring Packers
even if George “Papa Bear’
Halas has to leave his warm sky
suite to inspire the team on the
sidelines like he did in the old
days. The Bears will not win
easily though because most
games in the black and blue
division are tight struggles.
Walter Payton may run for 250
yards but the Bears will only
win by 17-13. Take the Packers
and the points if you care to bet.

Atlanta (6-6) at Los Angeles
(9-3): The Falcons can only
keep their slim wild-card hopes
alive by winning their last two
games. The Rams want to win
because they want to go for the
home field advantage in the
playoffs. Last week the Rams
managed to defeat defending
Super Bow] champion Oakland
at home to clinch the NFC West
title. -Los Angeles will rest
many regulars but will still
show enough firepower to
defeat Atlanta as the Falcons
will endure their thirteenth
defensive struggle of the
season. Rams 13-3.

Minnesota (8-4) at Oakland
(9-3): The Raiders will come
out smoking here after unex-
pectingly losing to the Rams in

the closing minutes last week,

Phi at “odds” with Greek

Oakland can practically score
at will here as long as Kenny
Stabler is quarterback. The
Vikings were lucky to win last
week against San Francisco
and are in store for a long after-
noon this Sunday. All the
Raiders have to do is win their
last two games to be the wild-
card team in the AFC. The Vik-
ings will help this cause by a
score of 35-10. Give the points
and take the Raiders.

Miami (9-3) at New England
(8-4): The Patriots can win the
AFC East by defeating both the
Dolphins and the Colts in their
last two games. The Dolphins
have too much momentum on
their side and should win by a
touchdown. The Patriots at
times have played uninspired
football this year for
mysterious reasons. How could
they have possibly lost to Buf-
falo at home? That game could
have easily been fixed by the
underworld. Dolphins 20-13.

Pittsburgh (8-4) at Cincinnati
(7-5): The Bengals are one of
the hottest teams in pro football
having won their last three in-
cluding a victory over Miami,
The Steelers only have to lose
this game by less than six and

Defense awakens as cagers
startle Hornet by 24 pts.

by Mark Mitchell

The Generals outscored Lyn-
chburg 22 to 6 midway through
the second half to route the
Hornets 93-69 Saturday night.

Oddly, enough, the second
half started with the Hornets
appearing to have the ad-
vantage. They were down by
one point (35 to 34), but they had
_ the momentum since W&L had
blown a seven point lead. Fur-
thermore, two Generals
starters, center Ardith Collins
and power forward Larry
Meyer, did not start the second
half because they were in foul
trouble.

However, the Generals’
bench responded magnificient-
ly. Back-up center Bob Smither-
man was 6 for 6 from the field,
and Bruce Williams performed
excellently to allow. the

Benefitrun cancelled

by Mark W. Danos

Fate seemed to have had it in
for the WLUR-Cross Country
team 24 Hour Relay.

The event which was to take
place on November 18 was
cancelled due to a lack of run-
ners. Injuries to the W&L cross
country team coupled with the
cancellation of Bridgewater
College was the beginning of the
end.

Al Weeks, team co-captain
was among the primary in-
juries with a bad toe. However
the team lacked enthusiasm
about the event, according to
Bill Welch, the other team co-
captain.

The cancellation was not all
bad for according to Mike
Lavitt, WLUR station manager,
it was a bad time of the year for
sponsors. The relay was on the
coattails of both the United
Fund and the Jaycees annual
fund drives.

These fund raising activities
also coincided with the mer-
chants outlay for Christmas

Generals to get 71 per cent
shooting from their bench.

The defense also responded
well.

The Generals played defense
with the most intensity they
have had all year, allowing only
ten points in the first twelve
minutes of the second half. Most
of the game, the Hornets stood
around on offense and exhibited
poor shot selection. Their in-
ability to run their offense
resulted in them being out-
rebounded 49-38, and out shot
57.4 to 35.7 per cent by the
shorter, but more patient
Generals.

Collins and Smitherman did a
good job of fronting All-ODAC
pivotman E. D. Schechterly.
But even when Schechterly got
the ball, Leunig, who shut down
his man, was there to help out.

stock. Since it was late October
to early November the mer-
chants had not yet begun to
receive their Christmas sales.

Lavitt did insist that the drive
to obtain sponsors was going
“fairly well’’ and that the event
would have ‘“‘come off” had it
not been for the team injuries
and cancellations.

They will however try again
probably the first weekend in
March, says Lavitt.

Wenke and Forlenza totally
outplayed Lynchburg’s point
guard Tom Selinger. While
Wenke and Forlenza combined
for thirteen points, Selinger was
0-5 from the field for no points.
Indeed, Selinger’s offensive
contribution for the evening
came in the form of an offensive
foul in the first half.

Pat Dennis, who led the
Generals with twenty points,
held his man, All-ODAC guard
Wayne Davis, to ten points.

In short, the victory put the
Generals on top of the ODAC
and restored what confidence
the Generals may have lost
after their humiliating loss to
York. At times, the Generals
showed how good they could be,
pressuring the ball defensively,
moving the ball well offensively
and attacking the offensive
boards. Now everyone knows
that this year’s team can be bet-
ter than last year’s. Larry
Meyer has impressed fans with
his steady play, offensive re-
bounding and high percentage
shooting at the strong forward
position. Ardith Collins seems
to have improved 100 per cent
over last year and his backup,
Bob Smitherman, has awesome
potential. The bench led by
Forlenza and Williams has been
the team’s strength. Returning
starters Wenke, Dennis, and
Leunig have improved. Thus,
this year’s Generals will be
disappointed if they fail to do
better than last year’s team.

than a minute over their op-
ponents. In addition the
Generals got one point victories
from Mowry and sophomore
Mike Deighen. Captains Knipp
and Rogers also won decisions
as the Generals extended their
dual meet record to 2-0.

“A big win,” said coach
Franke as he savored a victory
win. “I think the way we wrestl-
ed tonight is the way only cham-
pionship teams know how to

wrestle.”’

And with two wins in their
first two meets, the Generals
appear to be the team to beat in
the ODAC.

A busy week behind them, the
Generals now take a break
returning to action on January
13 and 14 with matches against
Campbell College and Duke
University. The next home
match will be February 7
against Hampden-Sydney.

Diego to take the AFC Central.
The Bengals will upset the
Steelers by 20-17 but expect the
Steelers to rebound next Sunday
to beat San Diego and win their
sixth straight division title.

Washington (7-5) at St. Louis
(7-5): Neither one of these up
and down teams deserves to
make the playoffs but the win-
ner of this Saturday’s battle has
a chance of being the NFC wild-
card representative. St. Louis
has an excellent chance
because a tie at 9-5 with the
Bears could put the Cards in the
playoffs because they defeated

Chicago 16-13 earlier this
season. Also, the Cards’ last
game is against the soon-to-be 0
for 27 Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
The Redskins are at a disad-
vantage because a tie with
Chicago would prove fatal
because of the best average
point differential applying to
conference games, whatever
that means. The Cardinals
defense is bad enough so the
Redskins can score at least two
touchdowns. The Redskins will
upset St. Louis by 17-14 to pro-
bably hand a playoff berth to an
unlikely candidate, the Chicago
Bears.

Ardith Collins controlled the
boards with 11 rebounds, but
early foul trouble and erratic
shooting made him ineffective
offensively. Defensively the
Generals were reaching and
grabbing instead of getting
position as evidenced by the
fact that the Yellow Jackets
were at the charity line most of
the evening.

Depending on sheer talent
alone the Generals showed they
can win even when they play

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Exam Week

With exams just a few days away and with the
pressure of knowing you don’t know the material, it is

difficult to think about any other earth-shattering pro-:

blems. The world of Washington and Lee seems to
slow down considerably when the end of a term comes
rolling around.

At times, the slow pace of exam week can get to you
more than the pressure of studying for your hardest
exam. It can be agonizing to wait from the time you
take your first exam, to the time you take your next
exam, to the time you take your very final exam.
There is nowhere to release this agony either. The
frats don’t party, the SAB hasn’t any movies schedul-
ed, sports take a break, and the Cockpit reverts back
to the way it used to be before it took on its ‘“‘pub”’ at-
mosphere. About the only thing left are the ‘“‘BV”’
class skin flicks which don’t really relieve frustra-
tions but only add to it.

Hopefully there will be no honor violations this ex-
am period. Competition during this time of year is in-
tense. The pressure of exams put an enormous strain
on the student to live by and uphold the honor system.
Passing or failing, graduation, getting a good job, ac-
ceptance to graduate school are all important
thoughts going through our minds now. To risk it all
by violating the honor code out of fear of failure is
foolish. A passing grade at the expense of one’s honor
is cheaply bought. The maintenance of one’s honor,
clear conscious and self respect are infinitely more
important in the long run.

But this is nothing to dwell on. More than likely,
every student will act honorably during exams. No
violations should occur. There are other issues this
column should approach and discuss, but because of a
lack of time to devote to serious thought of these
issues, they will not be adequately covered now. They
will be raised though for you to consider over the
Christmas break and to give you something else to
think about during the exam period besides your sub-
jects.

Should the U.S, be interferring in the Middle East
when Egypt and Israel seem to be doing fine on their
own?

Will the Cockpit be able to continue to provide the
campus with an entertainment alternative?

Will you be invited to the next Contact party?

Will the Ring-tum Phi be identifiable as an eight
page or twelve page paper and will the editor and
business manager speak to each other next term?

Good luck with exams. Have a happy holiday break.

“Bush” Parking

Regulated

Dear Editor:

I am writing at the request of
members of your student body
in an attempt to clarify the
policies on curfews, parking
and towing of automobiles on
the Sweet Briar College cam-
pus.

Male guests unless they are
properly registered to stay
overnight in our hostel or other
approved on campus locations
are expected to leave the cam-
pus by 12:45 a.m. (Sunday-
Thursday) and 3:45 a.m. (Fri-
day and Saturday) ; these hours
are forty-five minutes past the
conclusion of our daily visita-
tion hours and are actually ear-
ly morning of the following day.
An exception to this policy oc-
curs when men pick up or leave
a date in the early morning
hours at the front door of a dor-
mitory. Parking is in
designated lots which are
assigned on a space available
basis by our Security staff.
Guests arriving on campus can
complete a temporary parking
registration and obtain passes
at the Information Center.

Vehicles are towed im-
mediately if parked in fire lanes
or in such a manner as to
obstruct traffic. Vehicles are
towed after 12:45 a.m. or 3:45
a.m. (depending on the day) if
they are not parked in their
designated lot or have not been
properly registered.

I hope that this information
1 be helpful. If additional
clarification would be
eficial, please contact me.

Sincerely,

Robert H. Barlow
Dean of Student Affairs
Sweet Briar College

   

Correction

The letter to the editor from
Steve Abraham ‘81, not from
Steve Abraham ‘80 who is on the

Griffin ‘‘Laments”’ editorial

Editor, Ring-tum Phi:

Well, you have finally done it.
Until now, I have observed with
amused detachment the
obstreperous rancor that has
occured both in and around the
RtP between student jour-
nalists and student government
members this year. In fact, (as
you know), I have personally
complimented you for having (I
think), improved the paper. But
in the Dec. 1 issue, you have
taken what could and should
have been a good editorial con-
cerning Rick Goddard’s
resignation, and turned it into a
true disservice to your readers.
Rather than hold up Rick’s im-
pressive record of service to the
school community, you used the
occasion to take unwarranted
and (dare I say?), unfounded
pot-shots at the EC I would like
to address myself to three
points you make in your
editorial, ‘‘A Lamentation.”

First of all, you state: ‘‘What
should add to the  public’s
frustration is most of the
members of the EC are glad to
see him go.’’ FALSE. No one,
(not even you, J.M.G.), can ap-
preciate the contributions and
dedication Rick brought to his
job more than the other
members of the EC. I feel I
speak for the whole committee
when I say that we are not
‘glad to see him go.’’ Quite the
contrary, we are sorry that
time constraints forced him to
resign and he will be missed.

Secondly, you write: ‘‘...there
is little wonder he felt his hands
were tied when nearly every
motion he proposed recently
was scoffed at and defeated by
votes of 81 and 9-1.’’ Wrong
again. I refer you to pages one
and nine of your paper (same
issue) where your reporter cor-
rectly lists many of Mr. God-
dard’s achievements as an EC
member. Your reporter also
shows that a large percentage
of the motions that have been
passed by the EC this year were

secinies

proposed by Mr. Goddard.
Lastly, you make the judge-
ment that Rick’s motions
“*...were good ones and above
the comments of his peers. But
it is hard to implement change
in the ‘khaki culture’ if you
aren’t a member.” Surely thou
jest! Any motion made by an
EC member is worthy of com-
ment or there would be no need
for the committee to meet
weekly to kick around the burn-
ing issues of the day. Also, a dif-
ference of opinion does not
translate into a lack of respect,
as you suggest. As for the EC
(myself included, I suppose) be-
ing a bastion of the ‘khaki
culture,’ I again refer you to
your own paper. Specifically,
your own editorial of October
20th praises the EC for
demonstrating intelligent and
responsible action regarding
the Honor System, the Indepen-
dent Exam controversy, and

the funding of the Music Union.

It is my humble opinion that
this year’s EC is representative
of the student population, has
worked hard, and does not cater
to any one “faction.”’ Rick God-
dard has been an effective and
conscientious part of this
representative group. His ef-
forts have been recognized and
admired by at least this EC
member. Rick is a law student
who takes an active interest in
the affairs of the
undergraduates, and_ en-
courages a reciprocating in-
terest on our part. This campus
could use more students like
him. It could also use fewer
students who appear determin-
ed to dwell upon and exploit
situations that can be devisive.
Name-calling, off-the-wall
allegations, and attempts to put
one ‘‘fraction’’ against another
are harmful to everyone con-
cerned, and make life more dif-
ficult for those trying to make a

constructive contribution.
Sincerely,
George F’. Griffin

Letters to Editor

Dear Sir:

After reading last week’s arti-
cle concerning the dispute bet-
ween the editor and business
manager I cannot help but think
that the Ring-tum Phi has failed
to be completely objective. The
article could easily give one the
impression that the Publica-
tions Board witnessed a mighty
power struggle: a contest bet-
ween an authoritarian business
manager and a narrow-minded
editor.

I do not think the Ring-tum
Phi intended to portray Peter
Goss as being insensitive to the
importance of an_ editor’s
responsibilities (i.e. not having
to sacrifice good copy to make
room for more ads), nor did it
intend to portray Mike
Gallagher as being insensitive
to the importance of a business
manager’s responsibilities (i.e.
seeing that production costs are
covered). Unfortunately,
though, by including the
headline ‘‘Gallagher wants 12
pages,” and by re-emphasizing
the arguments Mike Gallagher
introduced at the Nov. 14
meeting while again rebuffing
the points brought up by Peter
Goss, the Ring-tum Phi simply
reproduced the same lack of
communication and refusal to
come to grips with the main
issue that was evidenced at the
meeting.

Even more distressing,
however, is the fact that
theRing-tum Phi devoted so
much coverage to the irrelevant
and inconsequential tangents,
half-truths, and misconceptions
which exemplified the discus-
sion that afternoon. After hav-
ing gone that far the article
could have at least pointed out
that all the unimportant issues
raised, such as the ROTC ad,
the overtime pay for production
costs, and other trivia which
may have unfairly cast doubts
on Peter Goss’ abilities as a
business manager were either
discarded or recognized as hav-
ing no bearing on the topic of
the meeting. But that part was
left out. The result was a
misleading article, one that fail-
ed to discriminate between the
importance of the efforts to
establish an effective system of
regulation and the unim-
portance of the resultant in-
fighting.

Ryland Owen
Pres., Pub. Board

Dear Editor:

I was indeed very pleased to
see in your last week’s issue a
copy of that Hollins’ editorial

espousing the glorious virtues ©

of women while castigating the
corrupt, polluted minds of men.
I agreed wholeheartedly with
the opinions expressed in this
fine piece of journalism and,
likewise, found it deplorable the
way the women are treated
around here. It’s positively
disgusting to see grown men
purposely try to take advantage
of these poor, sweet, innocent,
and saintly creatures just to
satify their male egos or relieve
their sexual frustrations, not
caring a whore’s tooth for the
women they have just degrad-
ed.

My girl friend, who happens
to go to Hollins, and I were just
discussing this problem the
other night and after she finish-
ed sucking my big toe, we got
into the meat of the matter. I
told her how the men here try to
corral their unknowing victims
by getting them drunk as quick-
ly as possible so to make the
trip to the, what’s the word
again, oh yes, rack a great deal
easier and less time consuming.
My girl friend said she was ap-
palled at such antics and could
not believe that the men here
would be so callous as to force
the devil’s drink down these
pure, unsuspecting women’s
throats. She wouldn’t discuss
the matter any further,
however, but after polishing off
her sixth gin and tonic, told me
that it’s also a disgrace how
men here think that the only job
suitable for women, due to their
supposedly feeble minds, is as a
homemaker. I agreed with her
and said there should be more
women nuclear physicists. She
agreed, but wasn’t quite sure
what a nuclear physicist was.

We ended our conversation by
concluding that most men here
are utterly hopeless while the
women, ever honest and loyal in
their mature relationships with
men, are righteous beyond
reproach, never allowing their
precious bodies to be used for
cheap sex, and thus belong en-
shrined in the Virgin’s Hall of
Fame. We agreed on this, of
course, but not after my girl
friend finished sucking my
other toe.

Sincerely yours,
Ring Lardner

E.C. unsure

(continued from page 1)

that he is concerned by the fact
that Dan Scott, night manager
of the Cockpit, had signed Sun-
nyland Slim, a Cockpit enter-
tainer, to a contract. University
Center Committee chairman
Galen Trussell should be
responsible for signing acts into
the Cockpit, Bovay said.

Trussell disputed the conten-
tion that the Union only had $207
left. He said it was his
understanding that some forms
of entertainment which had
been charged to the Union were
to be paid by the SAB. “‘My
understanding was I -would
spent $2,200 on Cockpit enter-
tainment,” Trussell said.

SAB co-chairman Charlie
Hulfish, however, said it was
his understanding that the
“Music Union would provide

entertainment, including
movies and acts.”’
EC members, however,

recalled that the money given to
the Union was solely for
musical entertainment. Thus,
the committee voted
unanimously to require the SAB
to pay $158 for movies which
had been shown in the Cockpit
and $101 for magazine subscrip-
tions for the UC library. This
left the Union with a balance of
$467.
Mike Missal asked Trussell,
“Did you realize you’d spent 75
per cent of your budget
already?”

One reason entertainment in
the fall term has been so lavish,
said Scott, is that new copy
right laws call into question the
possibility of having any enter-
tainment at all in the Cockpit. A
royalty must be paid for every
son a performer plays which
was not written by himself,
Scott said. A violation will cost
$250 per song, he added.

The school has hired an at-
torney to look into the matter,
said Scott. The attorney, Eric
Sisler, has recommended that
no entertainment be held in the
Cockpit until the school deter-
mines the legal situation, Scott
said.

The other reason there has —

been so much fall entertain-
ment at the expense of winter
entertainment is that there are
three big weekends in February
during which Cockpit entertain-
ment would be unfeasible, Scott
said.

Scott went onto defend
Trussell by saying that Trussell
was under the impression that
the Cockpit would be able to

of Music Union control

recover me money by charging
a cover charge.

When asked why the Cockpit
had decided not to charge the
EC authorized cover for the
Sunnyland Slim _ concert,
Trussell responded, “‘Because it
would have been totally ineffec-
tual.’’ He said it only would
have irritated people and it
wouldn’t have done much to off-
set the cost of the performance.

Scott was asked why he sign-
ed the contract for Sunnyland
Slim, even though he has no
authority over acts brought into
the Cockpit by the MU. Scott
said he did so because Trussell
was on vacation at the time the
contract had to be signed.

Scott went on to stress that
the Cockpit management is
vitally interested in what acts
go on in the Cockpit because, as
Jerry Darrell, Cockpit
manager, said, “it helps our
business.”’ Trussell said that,
up until the past two weeks, the
Cockpit has been contributing
between 50 and 60 per cent of
the money which has gone into
entertainment. Darrell said the
Cockpit has been making
money and wants to channel it
back into student entertain-
ment. Darrell said he thinks it’s
the Cockpit’s prerogative to be
able to charge a cover, but he
would be willing to come before
the EC to discuss it on a week-
by-week basis.

EC president Jim Underhill
said, “That’s one of the pro-
blems the EC is having. We
thought we’d have more con-
trol.”’ Another aspect of this
lack of control was hinted at
when Underhill said, ‘We
wonder who’s running the

‘operation:” Trussell or Scott.

Trussell was appointed by the
EC, and, is therefore, accoun-
table to it but Scott is accoun-
table to no one, except to
Trussell, who, many EC
members feel, just ratifies
Scott’s entertainment ~ deci-
sions.

It was made clear to Scott
that he was to be only an ad-
visor, Darrell said in response.
However, Scott is probably do-
ing more than he should be do-
ing,’’ Darrell admitted. Yet he’s
been able to bring in quality
entertainment at a relatively
low cost, he added.

Trussell complained that few
Music Union members were
showing up to meetings, mean-
ing he had to make all decisions

concerning Cockpit entertain-
ment. Because Scott has more
expertise in getting acts to
W&L, he usually let Scott take
care of arranging the entertain-
ment, while final approval must
come from him, Trussell said.
In further action, the EC
voted unanimously that com-
mittee co-chairmen be required
to meet with their ad hoc
member to discuss expen-
ditures at least three times a
year; once in the fall, winter
and spring terms. The meeting
in the spring term would have to
occur at least a week before ex-
ams. The motion was submitted
by parting EC law school
representative Rick Goddard.

Cappeto said that there would

the problem before the beginn-
ing of next year. Washington
and Lee musical entertainment
will certainly suffer, because
royalty fees will have to be
budgeted into future entertain-
ment plans and, as a result less

Kunstler said.

The trials were labeled
‘Federal Conspiracy Trials.”
Kunstler translated
“conspiracy” to mean a crime
of thinking.

The trial of Benjamin Spock
was the first conspiracy trial of
the peace movement, Kunstler
said. Spock represented the in-
tellectual movement against
the war, and in 1967, he and five
others were accused of con-
spiracy to pervert the youth of
America. They had _ been
outspoken proponents of draft
resistence.

In 1971, nuns and priests who
had burned draft records in
Maryland were charged with
conspiracy to kidnap Henry
Kissinger. The kidnapping plot
involved a bizarre scheme to
sue grenades to destroy the
heating system at the Capitol so
that Kissinger could be ab-
ducted during the commotion.

It was later revealed, that
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover
had bribed a prisoner at the
Harrisburg, Pa., penitentiary to
come forth with false testimony

the accused priests who also

All of the accused were ac-

VOLUME LXXVII

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, JANUARY 6, 1978

Student opinion ignored

SAB votes in closed

session to get Four Tops

by Randy Smith
The Student Activities Board
has voted overwhelmingly to
contact the Four Tops to per-
form during Fancy Dress
Weekend, theRing-tum Phi has

learned from a_ confidential

source on the SAB.

The vote to try to sign the
Four Tops to play Thursday
night, February 23, took place
after the last SAB meeting
before Christmas break. In a
closed session, SAB members
voted 10-1 in favor of contacting
the group for a reported $2,300,
the source disclosed. The Four
Tops is now a disco band.

Charlie Hulfish, co-chairman
of the SAB, confirmed the
report about efforts to hire the
Four Tops, but said he was not
sure about the price and would
‘“thave to check the minutes of
the meeting.” Jim Foreman,
treasurer of the SAB, also did
not remember the cost of the
disco band, but said the $2,300
figure sounded ‘“‘very close.”’

The Ring-tum Phi’s SAB
source said that the price of the
Four Tops was ‘‘supposed to be
a bargain.”’ The band reported-
ly is playing in Charlottesville
during the weekend of Fancy
Dress, thus lowering their price
tag for a Thursday night per-
formance in near-by Lexington.
Hulfish said that he thought the
Four Tops were commanding
$3,000 at the - University of
Virginia on Friday night.

Not included in the SAB’s
$2,300 cash outlay is the cost of a
back-up band for the Four Tops,
still unchosen. Foreman said
he did not know the total
budget for Thursday night, or
even the projected cost of the
entire weekend. He would not
know the expenses for the
weekend until the bills came in,
Foreman said.

According to the SAB source,
the anticipated performance by
the Four Tops is “primarily
responsible” for the three
dollar increase in the entrance
fee to Fancy Dress Weekend’s
activities. This year’s tickets
will cost $15 per couple.

‘Non-SAB members attending
the open meeting were asked to
leave before the vote. The
possibility of the Four Tops
playing Fancy Dress Weekend
was not brought up during the
meeting. Co-chairman Bill
Tucker hinted that he had “‘a
lead on a good band,’ but
declined to name the group in
an open session.

Hulfish said the meeting was
called into closed session

because ‘“‘if we had had an open
meeting, then people who we
don’t have much control over
would spread false rumors.”

“We are a business. We han-
dle a lot of money. We don’t
have time to solicit students
about entertainment. A decision
had to be reached,’’ Hulfish ex-
plained.

When asked why a band not
discussed in an open session
was voted on in a closed one,
Hulfish said he “didn’t see a
need for an open session... There
are times when we can’t have
students sliding into our office.”

He added that he felt the Stu-
dent Activities Board ‘‘is a good
cross representation’ of the
students, and that the SAB is
not ‘‘anti-student.”’

Saturday
classes

explained

by Jim Ingham

According to a plan approved
by the faculty in November of
1976, classes are scheduled on
Saturday this week. William
Watt, Dean of the College, said
that having Saturday classes is
necessary because New Year’s
Day fell on a Monday. He said
that this seemed to be the most
reasonable course to take.

Dean Watt said that the
reason the missed classes had
to be made up was because it
was necessary to keep the
number of classes for each
course the same. He said that
there are some classes which
meet only on Monday and that
not having classes would put
them way behind. He also said
that each day of the week had a
different schedule from any
other, and that missing one day
would cause a lot of problems.

Other plans were also
discussed, stated Watt, but
were rejected for one reason or
another. He said that starting
classes on Monday, thus remov-
ing the need for Saturday
classes, would have meant that
students would have to travel on
New Year’s Day. Another op-
tion, he said, was to have put off
the start of the winter term for a
whole week, but this would have
meant an additional week later

on.

NUMBER 13

 

Ashe and Colby to appear

by Jim Barnes

Tennis great Arthur Ashe and
superspook William Colby will
speak at W&L as part of Con-
tact’s 1977-78 program before
the February break. Ashe is
scheduled to speak on January
18, while Colby will follow on
February 2.

Ashe, a graduate of UCLA,
has won three of the grand slam
singles championships. He cap-
tured the Austrailian Open in
1970, Wimbledon in 1975, and the
U. S. Open in 1968. He also won
the World Championship of Ten-
nis singles title in 1975, and the
French Open men’s doubles
crown in 1971 with Marty
Riessen.

Perhaps Ashe’s most per-
sonally- treasured victories
have come when he has played
for the United States in Davis
Cup competition. Ashe’s strong

_ feelings on the responsibility of

U. S. pros to play for the Davis
Cup team earned him a
threatened three million dollar
law suit compiliments of Jim-

Copy Center
motive

by Ken Mastrilli

School officials and pro-
fessors are still puzzled as to the
motive for two break-ins at the
University Print Shop shortly
before the beginning of the fall
term final exam period.

There are still no suspects in
the incidents which are being
investigated by campus securi-
ty officials Bob Murray, and the
ever-present ‘“Murph.’’ There
were two break-ins: one on the
evening of Tuesday, December
6, and the other the following
night in which someone broke
into a cabinet. containing
printed copies of 27
undergraduate and law final ex-
ams.

‘Almost every professor who
had an exam in the cabinet had
a new one madeup and
reprinted,’’ said Fontanne
Bostic, who is the copy center
supervisor. Bostic said she had
asked the Buildings and
Grounds department to install a
lock on the copy center leading
to the room where the cabinet

my Conners in 1975.

Ashe, not only an excellent
player, is highly respected by
his colleagues as a spokesman
for improvement and innova-
tion in professional tennis. He is
the winner of the William M.
Johnston and Harold A. Lebair
Memorial Trophies for sport-
smanship.

Ashe also is an articulate and
longstanding opponent of the
apartheid policies of the
government of South Africa.

Few men are better ac-
quainted with the work of spies
than William Colby, the ex-
director of the Central In-
telligence Agency. He is a
graduate of Princeton Universi-
ty who served in the Office of
Strategic Services during World
War II. In 1943 he parachuted
into France to aid a Resistance
unit. Later in the war he lead a
commando group into Norway
to sabotage a railway line.

After the war he returned to
the United States, earned a law
degree from Columbia, and

break-in
questioned

was located but they were ap-
parently too busy to do the work
that Wednesday, she said. Dean
of Students Lewis John did have
B&G install locks on all doors
leading to the copy center the
day after the break-ins oc-
curred.

There is speculation on the
part of various school officials
that the person who broke in
was looking for the small
amount of money which was
sometimes kept in the cabinet.
Director of News Services Bob
Keefe suggested that it may
have been somebody’s idea of a
joke because it appeared that
nothing had been disturbed on
the night of the first break-in.

School Proctor ‘‘Murph”’
said, ‘‘Whoever broke in knew
what he was looking for and it
wasn't money.” Murph said he
and his assistants were ‘‘look-
ing at a few things,”’ but declin-
ed to comment in case their
suspicions were unfounded.

practiced law in New York.
When the Korean War broke out
he joined the OSS’ successor,
the CIA. He _ served in
Stockhome and Rome in the
1950s and was named station
chief for Saigon in 1959. Three
years later he became the chief
of the CIA’s Far Eastern divi-
sion in Washington. He returned
to Saigon in 1968 to preside over
the U. S. pacification effort
which included the notorious
Phoenix program. Over 20,000
Viet Cong and their sym-
pathizers were killed as a result
of this program which has been
criticised for its excesses
leading to the deaths of several
thousand innocent non-
combatants.

In 1971 Colby returned to the
CIA’s headquarters in Langley,
Virginia to assume command of
the agency’s supersecret Direc-
torate of Operations. He was
named Director of the CIA in
1973. In 1975, when President
Ford was reorganizing his Na-
tional Security Council, Colby
was relieved of his duties.

 

Notice

Due to complaints from
the student body about
crowded conditions at
last year’s Fancy Dress
Ball, the Student Ac-
tivities Board has decid-
ed to limit the sale of
tickets. They will be sold
ONLY to members of the
immediate Washington
and Lee community. This
includes students (law
and undergraduate) and
their dates, faculty, anda
limited number of alum-
ni. No guests from other
schools will be admitted.

Other details about this
year’s Fancy Dress—the
schedule of events, ticket
sale procedure...and the
announcement of the
theme for Friday night’s
Ball — will appear in
next week’s Ring-tum
Phi. Watch for it...

RtP Commentary

 

E.C. performance reviewed

by Lee Howard

Since the Executive Commit-
tee is not on ‘Washington and
Lee time”’ it did not meet Tues-
day (Monday?), which gives
the Ring-tum Phi an opportuni-
ty to assess the performance of
both the EC in general and EC
members in particular so far
this year.

First, it’s necessary to point
out that the EC has accomplish-
ed some very substantial
changes. Accounting guidelines
have been set up and ad hoc
members to committees have
been instructed to go over ex-
penditures with committee co-
chairmen at least once per
term. Parties and dinners for

- committee members partially
funded by EC money must be
made public and approved now
for the first time. Contact had
$590 taken away from it. Honor
defendants were given the right
to see a copy of all physical
evidence against them before a
trial is held. And the Music
Union was established.

These are not insubstantial
changes. They reflect an open-
ness to far-reaching, wor-
thwhile proposals which is
refreshing. However, the EC’s
unwillingness to make their
party decision binding on future
ECs will mean that less respon-
sible committees in the future
will backslide into the old
system of covering up parties.

Despite all the forementioned
changes made by this year’s
EC, it is hardly the crusading
group which it sometimes has
appeared to be. Much like last
year’s EC it waits for issues to
come to it. Unlike past years,
however, this year’s EC has
met issues head on rather than
delaying decisions for ‘‘further
study.” This is probably a
reflection of EC President Jim
Underhill’s no-nonsense ap-
proach to EC meetings. He
doesn’t like to let discussion
drag on when he believes a con-
sensus has already been reach-
ed. As a result , of course, it is
possible that he makes up some
members’ minds for them when
he says “I guess we all agree
that...’’ He certainly seems to
hold the balance of the commit-
tee firmly in his hand.

The following is the Ring-tum
Phi’s assessment of the other 11
committee members.

—George Griffin, vice presi-
dent. Although perhaps not as
much of a driving force on this
year’s EC as Sandy Stradtman
was on last year’s, this is more
of a reflection on the increased
leadership of Underhill as op-
posed to Bob Hunter than it is a
reflection of Griffin’s reduced
leadership capacity. Indeed,
when Griffin disagrees with
Underhill (which is surprisingly
often) his ideas are given as

much or more weight than the -

president’s. This was best
demonstrated when Griffin
almost single-handedly swayed
four votes to his side on the par-
ties issue.

—Neil Pentifallo, secretary.
Pentifallo has been absent
much of the year due to an
operation which kept him in the
hospital. It is therefore difficult

to assess his performance. He
has maintained his record as
the closest examiner of
representatives of organiza-
tions who want money, but his
leadership ability has yet to be
proven. Perhaps with improved
health he will take his place as a
leader of the EC.

—Mike Missal, senior. Missal
has projected himself as being a
maverick. An ardent defender
of Ariel one week, another week
he was adamantly opposed to
salaries for editors of publica-
tions. One week he voted to
depose Charlie Hulfish as SAB
co-chairman and another week
he didn’t want the EC to oversee
parties because he thought the
EC was becoming ‘‘too
overbearing on committees.”’
This has caused some persons
to accuse Missal of being a
‘“‘srandstander.’’: In any case
Missal is one of the most con-
cerned EC members:

—Doug Perkins,’ ‘senior.
Perkins seems? ‘interested in
what’s being discussed and on
occasion injects ‘an‘ intelligent
comment, but his:participation,
for a senior, has been disappoin-
ting. Perhaps Perkins needed a
breaking-in period and will now
live up to his capabilities. He
has usually voted to retain the
status quo.

—Jack Bovay, junior. Bovay
has demonstrated enough
leadership ability to make him
a strong candidate for EC presi-
dent next year. Bovay is very
intense. His arguments are
often impassioned. If Griffin is
the reasoner and Underhill the
strong arm of the EC, Bovay is
the heart. Despite a basically
conservative make-up, Bovay
voted to have parties okayed by
the EC and to depose Hulfish.

—Jim Davis, junior. Davis
very rarely says anything. This
makes it very difficult to say
that he’s added anything to the
EC. He did contribute quite a bit
to the Contact controversy. He
was a staunch defender of Con-
tact and of his friends Walter
Granruth and Billy Webster.
Davis was EC ad hoc member
to Contact, but knew nothing of

Contact’s actions until the Ring-
tum Phi disclosed them.

—Steve Abraham,
sophomore. Abraham, much
like Perkins, seems interested
but doesn’t say that much.
When he does make a comment,
however, it is usually very
perceptive. Give Abraham
time. He’s just a sophomore.

—Andy Bodenstab,
sophomore. There is very little
you can say about a person who
has said, perhaps, two words all
year. Except he is not doing his
job.

—Chris Gammon, freshman.
Gammon doesn’t say all that
much but he seems to be very
sharp and the questions he asks
and comments he makes in-
dicate he is learning very rapid-
ly.

—Jackie Boyden, law school.
Boyden rode on the coattails of
Rick Goddard for a while, but
seems to have struck out on her
own since then. Very self-
assured, she has a liberal voting
record:

—Rick Goddard, law school.
Enough said. He’s gone.

ROTC commitment
clarified

by Galen Trussell

ROTC enrollment does not
lead automatically to a three
year commitment, according to
Captain Long of the Washington
and Lee ROTC department.

Long said that many
freshmen and sophomores har-
bor the misunderstanding that
ROTC enrollment implies a
commitment of three years’ ac-
tive service. This is no longer
true since the Army now has a
surplus of officers. Instead of
the three year commitment, the
Army has an Active Duty for
Training (ADT) program which
commits ROTC cadets to only
three months of active duty
after graduation.

An ROTC cadet may be
guaranteed that he will receive
ADT. The ADT option is part of
the enlistment contract signed
by cadets at the start of their
junior year. Those cadets in-
terested in attending graduate
school who request ADT can
receive a three year deferment
before serving their three mon-
ths.

When an ROTC cadet chooses
ADT he commits himself to
three months of training after

Cockpit hosts Gong Show

each other, as well as other stu-
dent organizations, such as Con-
tact, EC, SAB, Calyx and all
others. All college students
would be eligible for the gala
event, and that includes any in-
terested females from
neighboring schools, and all law
students as well.

Tucker’s present plans in-
clude having three faculty
volunteers as judges. He says
that prizes will be awarded to
those students doing the best
job of ‘‘entertaining,”’

Tucker believes the
more students that participate,
more fun will occur. And after
the cold weather, rain and ex-
ams, what better way to start
off a new term? If you are in-
terested, either see him or drop
your name off at the secretary’s
desk in the Student Center.

Events

by David Talley

The first two months of 1978
promise many activities for the
College Republicans. There are
thee main events in January.
The inauguration of John
Dalton as Virginia’s governor
takes place on January 14th.
CR’s from around the state will
attend the ceremony, as well as
the associated festivities. The
W&L Republican Club has been
invited to party with the Mary
Washington CR’s on January
21, and the Mary Wash girls will
come down here on the 28th to
play volleyball.

February 10-12 has been set
as the date of the College
Republican Federation of
Virginia’s annual convention. It
will be held at the Fort
Magruder Inn in Williamsburg
on the 10th. Registration takes
place followed by suite parties.
The next day, the business of
the Federation will be con-
ducted, including the election of
new officers and the adoption of
a platform. Several speakers
are planned, including the can-
didates for the Republican
Senatorial nomination and na-
tional Republican figures. A
banquet will be held that even-
ing, followed by a dance.

In addition, there should be a
mixer or two with the
Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege; CR’s and some other
events taking place within the
club.

A good movie hits Lexington—

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor

There are many perils to liv-
ing in our small metropolis, but
to any moviegoer there is one
disadvantage of supreme an-
noyance. This is the Christmas
film squeeze.

We’ve all been through it —
you wait for a new hit film to ar-
rive in Lexington all through
the fall term. It opened in your
city soon after you got here in
September. December arrives,
you're still waiting, you’ve
finished your last exam...and
then you walk past the State or
Lyric. And what do you see?
Yes! The local movie ownership
has finally decided to stop its 3-
month run of Walt Disney and
cheap porn flicks! The movie
you awaited so anxiously is
coming to town!!!...two days
after you leave for home. And at
home, the movie has come and
gone. Too bad.

So just imagine our surprise
when, upon returning to Lex-
ington, we found “Oh, God!”

still playing at the State...one of
the most talked about movies of
recent months.

And understandably so. Carl
Reiner has worked one of the
greatest miracles in this year’s
cinema corpus. He’s made God

a laughing matter.
The story revolves around
“the big G’ — as he calls

himself — who figures it’s about
time to pay this world another
visit and spread the word. Play-
ing God is no less than George
Burns. With Crosby and Benny
dead, and Hope still a little too
bawdy to be even saintlike,
much less take the driver’s
seat, Burns was almost certain-
ly the natural choice. And he br-
ings to the. sereen one of the
most endearing comic portraits
in years. From the sneakers on
his feet to the fishing cap on his
head, he is pure magic.

The variety of techniques he
employs to inspire belief in the
heart of a” grocery manager
(played by co-star John
Denver) is winning. But the

Bradley selected by.
Rhodes committee

Mark A. Bradley, a W&L
senior American history major,
was one of 32 college men and
women in America named
Rhodes Scholars last weekend.
The Rhodes is considered one of
the most important academic
honors an American student
can receive.

Bradley becomes Washington
and Lee’s third Rhodes Scholar
in the past seven years, and
W&L’s 1ith since the program
was established in 1902 by the
British philanthropist Cecil
Rhodes.

Bradley will spend two years
at Oxford in England
“reading,” or studying, modern
history. He said he hopes to pur-
sue a career in the Foreign Ser-
vice.

He is a Phi Beta Kappa stu-
dent at W&L whose cumulative
grade-point average is 3.8 on a
4.0 scale. He has won a number
of grants and scholarships, in-
cluding a Robert E. Lee Honor
Scholarship, W&L’s Elizabeth
B. Garrett Scholarship in
history, a George C. Marshall
Research Foundation Scholar-
ship, a Virginia Merit Scholar-
ship, and two academic awards
in the German department at
W&L, the Jim Stump and
James S. Woods prizes. He has
also held two Robert E. Lee
Research Grants in history.

Bradley was Virginia
amateur boxing champion in
the 140-150-pound weight class
from 1972 to 1976. In addition to
his studies, he has worked part-
time throughout college.

He is the son of State Police
Sgt. and Mrs. Charles S.
Bradley of Roanoke. His grand-
mother, Mrs. George Butler,

lives on a beef cattle farm in
Steeles Tavern, north of Lex-
ington, and Bradley lives there
and helps with framwork dur-
ing the school year.

Rhodes Scholars are chosen
on a regional basis in the United
States. Bradley was one of four
selected from a six-state region
which includes Virginia. Selec-
tions are based on intellectual
achievement, character,
leadership, and physical vigor.

Nationally, 32 Rhodes
Scholars are selected each
year. Twelve 1977 recipients
were women. This was the se-
cond year women were eligible
to compete.

climactic courtroom scene is
the key. Hopefully it will secure
an Oscar nomination for Burns.
At least, it has brought him
back on his high plane after his
pitifully wooden last venture in
“The Sunshine Boys.”’ In short,
Burns makes God the kind of
guy you’d kinda enjoy having
around. And that’s really what
it’s all supposed to be about in
the long run, right?

The supporting characters
are all warm, funny, believably
confused. The pace is brisk and
never wavers from the main
story line. And along the way,
we are presented with an array
of marvelously funny people,
from an incredulous
newspaperman, to a villainous
evangelist, in short, the usual
spread anybody would en-
counter if they claim to see God
in the john.

“Oh, God!’? — some will
claim — is the worst kind of
movie by modern standards,
foolishly romantic. In truth, it is
just a bit corny; but aren’t most
of our greatest films that way?
But no matter. Burns is are
great ~— he’ll make you
laugh...and when the film’s
over, you’ll be bound to be sorry
he left so soon. Go see this
movie; if you missed it this go-
round, never fear — it’ll be
around again soon.

McHenry’ssuccessor

debated by UCA

by Jim Barnes

The state of the coaching
shake-up in the football pro-
gram is so sensitive that Presi-
dent Huntley initially only con-
sulted the faculty members of
the University Committee on
Athletigs on the future leader-
ship of the football team.
Huntley said that he separated
faculty members Drs. Kozak,
Elms, Ray, Devogt, and
Steinhiemer (who was not in at-
tendance) from law student
Derek Swope, and undergrad
seniors Mark Bennett and Mark
Derbyshire, because he did not
want the students presence to
intimidate any free exchange
between the faculty and the
President concerning the “‘foot-
ball program.”

Huntley met with the faculty
members of the Athletic Com-
mittee on Friday, December 2,
at 12:30 in the afternoon, the
regular time the whole commit-
tee meets. Initially the student
members felt their opinion was
being avoided, but had their
suspicions removed when
Huntley, early in the following
week, personally briefed them
on the deliberations to date.

The students anticipate that

they will have significant input
into the final decision on the
football team’s new leadership.
As Swope says, ‘‘He (Huntley)
assured us that we’d be in on the
decision every step of the way.”’

There is some _ question,

_ however, whether the coaching

change will be limited to Bill
McHenry’s old top spot. After
meeting with Huntley Bennett
was asked if the discussions
about next year’s coaching staff
were limited to head coach.
Bennett replied, “That question
will lead us to matters. that we
are not ready at this time to
discuss.”

Swope believes that the duties
of Athletic Director’ were very
trying for McHenry. Swope
said, ‘‘He looks like he’s really
worried about a lot of different
things.”’

Huntley remained noncom-
mitted on the question of where
the next head coach will come
from. He said, ‘Whether we'll
seek a new coach from the out-
side or not has not been decided
yet.’ Huntley also said that the
matter requires a fairly prompt
decision, but it will not be made
until after the Christmas break.

Four swimmers

are NCAA best

Four of W&L’s swimming
Generals have achieved na-
tional ranking in their respec-
tive events. This information
was released by the NCAA in
their first Division III ‘“Top
Ten” listing of the 1977-78
season.

Senior John Hudson, a thir-
teen time All-American in the
past three seasons, is ranked
number one in the 1,000 yard
freestyle with a time of 9:46.99.
The closest challenge to Hud-
son’s time is thirteen seconds
back at 9:59.5. Hudson is also
ranked number two in the 500
free with a 4:48.3. The leader in
the 500 has a time of 4:45.96 and
was last year’s national cham-
pion.

Senior co-captain Peter
Meem is ranked number two
this season in the 200 yard
breastroke, while junior co-
captain Kieth Romich is the na-
tion’s third ranked swimmer in
the 100 freestyle. Junior Chip
Hoke is ranked fourth in the 500
free.

In addition to these four in-
dividuals, both of the Generals’
relay teams are also ranked in
the nation’s top five Division III
times. The 400 free relay of Bob

Newcomb, Scott Duff, Romich
and Hudson is ranked third,
while the 400 medley relay team
of Drew Pillsbury, Will Hodges,
Duff and Newcomb is ranked
fifth.

Last year, W&L finished the
year as the nation’s ninth rank-
ed Division III team and had
five All-Americans on their
roster.

Coach Bill Sterns’ swimmers
face the Gobblers of Virginia
Tech in Blacksburg this Satur-
day. Tech is one of eight Divi-
sion I teams on the 1977-78 W&L
swimming schedule. Last year
Tech blew the Generals out of
the water, but Stearns thinks
this team can reverse last
year’s verdict.

Their first home meet of the
season will be Saturday,
January 14th against George
Washington University in the
Cy Twombly Pool. W&L is cur-
rently . 2-1 overall defeating
James Madison 58-55 and VMI
68-45 and losing to the Universi-
ty of Richmond 69-44. The team
spent the week prior to
Christmas training at the Swim-
ming Hall of Fame in Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla.

SUPER BOWL XII

 

Can the “Orange Crush” put the squeeze
on 'T.D." and ‘Roger the Dodger.’’ We'll
find out Jon. 15.

Denver by 3

After six pre-season, 14
regular season and two playoff
games, the emotionally charg-
ed “Orange Crush’ from the
snowy mile-high city of Denver
will take on the _ highly
mechanized and _ disciplined
Cowboys from the “good ole
boys’ state of Texas.

Both teams have run, passed,
blocked and tackled their ways
to the top of their respective
conferences, although Denver
has been more consistent
throughout the year. Sure
Dallas was 12-2 in regular
season play as was Denver.

But Landry’s leviathans were
a hot and cold team, a fact
evidenced by their two playoff
victories this year. They
decimated the Chicago Bears
but then appeared flat against
the ill-fated Minnesota Vikings.

To get to the Super Bowl
Denver had to beat two of the
roughest teams in the NFL,
Oakland and Pittsburgh. They
did it on the strength of their
defense, which is the main
reason they will beat the
Cowboys. Sure the Cowboys
beat them in that meaningless
last game of the regular season
when the Broncos played their
backup QB Norris Weese most
of the game. Weese’s only ap-
pearance in Super Bowl XII will
probably come when he holds
for Jim Turner’s extra point at-
tempts. This is barring any in-
jury to veteran signal-caller
Craig Morton.

Denver will be able to shut off
the Dallas running attack of
Tony Dorsett and Bob
Newhouse mainly through the
efforts of All-Pros Lyle Alzado
and Tom Jackson.

Jackson may be the best
linebacker in pro football today.
Look for him to be around the
ball on every play and perhaps
intercept a Roger Staubach
aerial or two. Alzado is a
leader. He gets everyone psych-
ed up. Sometimes a little too
much, as he has a tendency to

Dallas rolls

This may be The Year of The
Horse, but it is not the year of

the Denver Broncos. The Dallas |
Cowboys will regain some of the }
NFC’s lost pride at the season }

finale in the Superdome.
While the Broncos have

amassed an impressive 12-2 |

regular season record (one of
those losses being
Cowboys at the regular season’s
conclusion) they have been less
than commanding in the
playoffs. Dallas on the other

hand shows no sign of stagger- |

ing in their holy quest.

The game will be a classic |

match of defenses, pitting the

innovative 3-4 of Denver against |

the more traditional 4-3 lineup
of Dallas. But the Cowboy of-
fense will make orange mar-
malade out of the ‘Orange
Crush.”’ Roger Staubach, Tony
Dorsett, Preston and Drew
Pearson, Robert Newhouse,

Golden Richards, and Billy Joe |

DuPree, in the hands head

coach Tom Landry, the game’s |

offensive genius, will baffle
Bronco chief Red Miller, and
wear down his highly touted
defense on the field.

Craig Morton is the key to

Denver’s offense. His injured }
hip will only accentuate his’

characteristic immobility set-
ting up to pass. Harvy Martin
and Ed “Too-Tall” Jones will
play rodeo putting their own
special brand on Morton’s hip,
and if Morton goes, so goes the
Bronco’s chances. The rest of
the Dallas ‘‘flex” should be able
to corral Denver’s patchwork
offense.

It’s also safe to say that Lan-
dry possesses some special in-

sights on Morton that Miller

does not have on Staubach.

The Cowboys have the playoff
experience behind them and
enough poise to tame the Bron-
cos away from their partisan
crowds at Mile High Stadium. If
you want to make the game “‘a
little more interesting,”
this game might need it, take
the Cowboys and give up to9'2.

to the }

and}

 

Lee ranked eighth in the state of
Virginia by the Roanoke Times.
Washington and Lee is present-
ly ranked above Old Dominion
University, Richmond and
Randolph-Macon.

The Generals shot excep-
tionally well in their victory
over Eastern Connecticut. They
hit 20 of 22 shots from the foul
line. From the field, they were
led by super shooter Pat Den-
nis. Dennis not only had 35
points, but shot an amazing 77
per cent from the field, hitting
on 17 of 22 shots. The Generals
also got some scoring from
their front line as power for-
ward Larry Meyer had twenty
points and small forward Dave
Leunig had eleven points.

The Generals’ torrid shooting
did not continue the next night
so they had a difficult time with
a 24 Staten Island team. The
Generals trailed by one at half,
but pulled away late in the
game. Leading the way again
was senior guard Dennis who
had 33 points. Again Meyer and
Leunig scored in double figures
with 14 and 12 points respective-
ly. Freshman center Bob
Smitherman, filling in for the
injured Ardith Collins had nine
rebounds.

The Generals will host their
tenth annual Washington and
Lee Invitational Tournament
this Friday and Saturday even-
ings at Doremus Gymnasium.
The Generals have won seven of

the nine previous invitational

titles and figure to make it eight
out of ten. They take on Case
Western of Cleveland, Ohio
(4-17 last year) Friday at 9 p.m.
Then in the finals at 9 p.m. on
Saturday they will meet the
winner of Swarthmore (7-13 last
year) and Salisbury State (16-15
last year).

This tournament may answer
two big questions. First, can the
Generals play two good games
within a_ twenty-four hour
period? So far this year they
have not. In the first game of
the season they blasted the in-
ept Clinch Valley College off the

_ floor. However, the next night,

they lost to patsy York in a ma-
jor upset. On the road trip, they
beat a respected team fairly
easily, but the next night they
had to fight for their lives and
were outrebounded by a 2-6
team. Physical and/or emo-
tional fatigue have been cited as
reasons for this inconsistency.
It may be too demanding to play
with the intensity that Coach
Canfield requires for two con-
secutive nights. Nobody knows
the answer for sure, but if the
Generals. lose Saturday
everybody will be asking the
question.

Secondly, the offense scored a
lot fewer points on the trip up
north. Whether this reflects a
more disciplined style of play, a
different type of competition, or
just a fluke, is hard to say at
this point. However, it is in-
teresting to note that
Washington and Lee point
guards were averaging around
twenty points a game before the
road trip, but averaged fewer
than five points a game during
the winter break.

rough the passer. Dallas has a slight edge with

Denver has been coming up
with the big play all year.
Jackson’s two interceptions in
the last five minutes of the
playoff game against the
Steelers is a perfect example.
Denver’s offense converted
both interceptions into scores to
put away the Steelers who were
in the game until then.

Denver doesn’t have a high-
powered offense with intricate
formations like Dallas. The
Broncos rely on the strength of
their outstanding offensive line
to give protection to Craig Mor-
ton and open holes fer Rob Ly-
tle, the former Michigan stan-
dout, and John Keyworth. Also,
don’t be surprised if you see
Otis Armstrong come off the
bench and pick up a crucial first
down for the Broncos, much as
he did in the closing minutes
against Oakland when the Bron-
cos needed.a first down to keep
possession and run out the
clock.

The two teams run and pass
equally well. But Morton should
be able to throw against a
Dallas secondary which is
suspect. Morton is a good
passer, especailly when he’s
throwing in the direction of
Haven Moses who caught six
passes for 168 yards against
Oakland. Both Charlie Waters
and Cliff Harris can be beaten.
The Steelers’ Lynn Swann prov-
ed that two years ago in Super

shaw burned them for 180

Staubach. He can run whereas
Morton is not nearly as mobile
in the pocket. Staubach is a
streak passer while Morton is
fairly consistent. Ironically,
Morton was traded from Dallas
so that Staubach could start all
the time, thus ending the annual
battle there for the quarter-
backing job.

Stopping the Staubach to
Pearson connection will be dif-
ficult but if anyone can do it the
Broncos can. Their secondary
plays both the pass and the run

very tough.

But can Dallas defeat ‘‘fate,”
a formidable adversary which
appears to be on Denver’s side
this year. This will be Dallas’
fourth appearance. They’ve lost
two and they’re 1-2, and would
like to even the score as well as
pick up the $25,000 for each win-
ning player. But ‘“‘fate,” that
most powerful of intangibles,
appears to be on Denver’s side.

Jimmy the Greek always has
a category he calls the “in-
tangibles,”’ which I guess in-
cludes team spirit, motivation
and “the big break,” then it
must be Denver. Denver 20—
Dallas 17 in a classic confronta-
tion.

than originally thought. As a
result, the Generals will pro-
bably have to battle Campbell
College and Duke University
without the promising
freshman on January 13th and
14th.

Despite the loss of Kramer,
the Generals are still confident
that they will have a successful
season. This year’s schedule,
which features Division I
schools Harvard, Duke, and
VMI, is the longest and most
challenging the team has faced
in years, with only three mat-
ches scheduled in Lexington.
According to the Generals the
severity of the schedule won’t
hinder the teams performance.
“If you enjoy wrestling you
don’t even think about the
schedule,’ said sophomore

Mike Deighan. Junior Captain
Ed Rodgers, never one to be
found without something to say,
also commented on this year’s
schedule. ‘Sure it’s rough,”
said the talented 150 pounder,
“but to have a first rate wrestl-
ing program you need challeng-
ing matches. Any team can beat
up on a bunch of nobodies, but it
doesn’t prove a thing. And,
when you look at last year’s
record (10-3 with a victory over
VMI), I think you’ll find we’re
definitely capable of mixing it

up with the big boys.”
Following their matches with
Campbell and Duke, the

Generals remain on the road
throughout January, not return-
ing home until February 7th
when they battle ODAC rival
Hampden-Sydney.

Here’s the good news. The Quiet Company has in-
creased the dividends paid to its policyowners in
1978. This is the 19th dividend scale increase in the
past 26 years — a record matched by no other major
life insurance company. The dividend allocation of
$366 million is being paid to Northwestern Mutual’s

1.2 million policyowners.

When dividend rates go up, life insurance costs go
down. The way prices are going these days on most
things, that’s something to think about. I'd be

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The Grinch who
stole Saturday

Every mink down in Mink-ville liked Saturday a lot,

But the Grinch who lived in the middle of Mink-ville did not!
The Grinch hated Saturday, and for a very poor reason,

It didn’t quite fit into the school day season.

The Grinch, from his perch high in Washington Hall,

Where everday life seems so trivial and small,

Said to himself, on some dark gloomy day,

‘‘T’ve got to find a plan to take Saturday away.

If I take Saturday away, then to school they must come,

Ha! toschool they must come, amidst their hangovers from rum,
They must leave their warm beds and with sad hearts,

Say goodbye to their sweet, little Friday night tarts.

They must rise bright and early on this January 7 date,

And come to school in a hurry and stay late, late, late!

Now the mean old Grinch was as delighted as could be,
and he told himself so, as he slapped his own knee,
‘‘Oh, how happy I am to take Saturday away,

Oh, how happy I am that the minks must pay,

For getting an extra day with their ‘rents,

For whom I really wouldn’t give a petty two cents.
Even though Monday was the day after New Year’s,

I am sure they only wanted it to sip a few more beers.

Then the Grinch sat down, and with a couple of wheezes, ) «
With a couple of belches and a couple of sneezes, ;

He took out the calendar, a pair of scissors and turned, -

To the week of the first, and then his heart yearned,

To cut out Saturday, and cut, cut he did.

He cut and he snipped and he snipped and he cut and before long,
Why even before the Lee Chapel clock struck an early morning
dong,

Before the sun rose high in the dawn,

Saturday, sweet Saturday, was gone.

Way down in Mink-ville lives a special breed of evil;
Saturday-stealing grinches who eat little finches.

But also in Mink-ville live the minks who are good,

They go to school during the week, like all students should.

On Sunday, it’s Sunday-school. On Monday, it’s Monday-school.
On Tuesday it’s Tuesday-school and on Wednesday it’s Wednesday-
school. On Thursday it’s J-school and even on Friday, it’s C-school.
But Saturdays, sweet Saturdays are to each and every mink,
No-school days, and so they rightly think!

To the minks, school on Saturday is not so very funny,

They'd miss sleeping, and minking, and even Bugs Bunny.

Now the minks took this seriously, as serious as could be,

And they looked everywhere for answers, they looked under trees,
They looked under stumps, they looked under bumps,

They looked under rocks, they looked behind clocks,

They looked everywhere where lookers would look,

And the answer was found ina history book!

The period of the sixties was where the answer was found,

When the children were vocal and sat on the ground.

But minks are never vocal, people would misconstrue,

Minks only thirst, and do what minks do.

Amidst the confusion, a speaker arose,

and opened his mouth and said on his toes,

‘If the Grinch wants Saturday school, he can go, and take a leap,
We'll do as minks do, and stay home and sleep.”

Letters to Editor

Concern urged

Editor, Ring-tum Phi:

Following the _ constant
pleading of concerned
Americans, as well as recent
resolutions passed by the Ap-
palachian Trail conference and
the Appalachian National
Scenic Trail Advisory Council
urging ‘immediate congres-
sional action, bills providing for
the future protection of the A.T.
have at last reached congress.

At present, over 40 per cent of
the A.T. lies on private land and
its existance is therefore sub-
ject to the descretion of the
owners. In addition, 175 miles of
the trail are already on roads
and much of the scenic beauty
has succumed to the get-rich-
quick schemes of land
speculators and_ private
developers.

Thus, House Bill 8803 and
Senate bill 2006 have been in-
troduced to insure the halt of
any further damage to the trail
by providing for the following:

1) authorization of monies to
protect the trail

2) creation of a wider Ap-
palachian Trail corrider

3) insured continuation of the
A.T. Advisory Council as well
as provisions for the Ap-
palachian Trail Conference to
have a vote on the council

In order to insure the passage
of these bills, it is imperative
that concerned citizens act now
by writing their senators and
congressmen, urging them to
support Senate bill 2066 and
House of Representative bill

8803.

If you hike or maintain a por-

Bluegrass course

An appreciation course in
bluegrass music will be offered
this winter term to all in-
terested students. The course
will deal with the history of
bluegrass, the instruments, and
personalized instruction where
possible. No credit will be given
for this course.

All interested students should
contact Mr. Burr Datz to sign
up for the course. He will
schedule class meetings at a
time when the greatest number
of students can attend, probably
one afternoon a week for an
hour. The deadline for register-
ing is Wed., Jan. 11. Mr. Datz
can be contacted at the dining
hall.

Traveler
from

Altruria

How was your vacuous-
cation? Mine was a barrel of
laughs. I went home to Altruria
fully expecting to do absolutely
nothing during vacation. Ex-
cept visit old friends, take out
old girls, sip cool beers and, of
course, watch football.

When I got to my house I
opened my door expecting to be
flung into the arms of dear old
Mom and Dad. Instead I had to
step over the arms and legs and
other various appendages at-
tached to approximately ten
naked bodies. And that was just
in the kitchen. It was an orgy. In
my house! Frantically, I sear-
ched for Mom and Dad amidst
the gyrating melee. “Mom?
Dad?”’ I said, trying to peer in-
to the peoples’ faces, but
somehow missing. ‘‘Come,
come” I heard someone say,
but when I approached I found
out she didn’t want me.

Finally, a couple approached
me. I discerned from their man-
ner and their relatively greater
amount of clothing (he wore
some beads, she had a band-aid
on her toe) that they now owned
the place. ‘‘We transcend that
you relate to schizoid time-
relevant requirements of
place,’’ he said. ‘‘I didn’t use an
anti-perspirant today and I may
not use one tomorrow,” I
agreed. “By the way, where are
Mom and Dad,” I asked. ‘“They
have transcended the
quintessential womb of the
tomb,” he mumbled. ‘You
mean they’re dead?” I gasped.
“No they’ve moved to New
Jersey.’’

Thanking them, I left before
they could ask whether I would
care to stay for some tea and
crumpets. After all, I wouldn’t
have felt right asking. They
weren't expecting company.

Conner, both employees at at
the Copy Center, discovered
footprints on a table under a
window which someone had us-
ed as a way into the print shop.
Neither Conner nor McCoy
could tell whether anything had
been taken from the cabinet.
“In a place that prints over
100,000 peices of paper a day it’s
virtually impossible to keep
track of everything,” said
Keefe. Keefe said it was so ob-
vious that someone had been in
the cabinet that it would not do
the person who may have taken
copies of the exams any good
because the professors involved
simply made up new ones.
There were numerous types
of exams in the cabinet in-
cluding those from the history,
politics, economics, math,
biology and psychology depart-
ments, as well as some law ex-

“It was just a big pain for
those professors who had to
completely rewrite, type and
reprint a new exam, especially
when they weren’t even sure if
any were taken,’’ said
(Associate Dean of the College)
Robert McAhren, a history pro-
fessor. “I found out the Thurs-
day morning before the beginn-
ing of exams and had to spend a
whole day making up a new ex-
am which wasn’t nearly as good
as the first one,”’ he said.

In all, 13 of the 15 professors
who had exams in the cabinet
felt obligated to make up new
exams, said one professor, who
added that he knew of one pro-
fessor who ‘‘booby-trapped”’ his
exam just in case someone tried
to use a stolen original.

The general consesus among
professors asked was that so-
meone was looking for money
that was sometimes kept in the
cabinet as none of the exams in
the vandalized cabinet ap-
peared to be disturbed.

Saturday

classes

(continued from page 1)

When asked why all the days
were shifted instead of simply
moving Monday’s classes to
Saturday, Dean Watt replied
that this would have caused a
number or problems. One, he
said, was for those classes
which met only on Monday, this
would have meant them
meeting twice in three days,
which wouldn’t have given
those students a long enough
time to prepare for these week-
ly meetings. Watt said another
reason for doing this was
because of the fact that as few
as possible classes are schedul-
ed on Friday afternoon, mean-
ing that as few as possible
classes will be meeting on
Saturday afternoon.

Watt said that the last time
Saturday class was held was
three or four years ago. Next
year, he said, because New
Year’s Day will fall on a Mon-
day, students. will have three
weeks for Christmas break, in-
cluding one full week after New
Year’s Day.

Washington and Lee University
are down more than 40 percent
from last year, according to
Ken Ruscio, assistant director
of admissions.

As of last Friday, the school
had received 516 applications,
compared to. 918 by the same
date last year. W&L has receiv-
ed an average of 1,320 applica-
tions each year, said Ruscio,
ee will be hard ‘pressed to

 

Applications for admission to

reach that figure this year with
the Feb. 15 application deadline
only 212 weeks away.

Ruscio attributes this
substantial drop to several fac-
tors, most notably the addition
of an essay to the application
form. The applicant is asked to
“develop an essay of 400 to 600
words discussing what in-
dividual, living or dead, you
would most enjoy talking to for
an evening and state precisely
why.”

Dave McLean, one of two
students who help with admis-
sions, said he believes the ques-
tion has been more a delaying
factor and by. the time all ap-
plications are counted there will
have only been a 20 percent
drop. He says that the question
will have to be dropped,
however, because students who
use W&L as a back-up for Ivy
League schools may not take
the time to answer a long essay
question. W&L has a history of

being able to attract “Ivy
League rejects,’’ he added.

The question was included
“primarily to gain a better
understanding of their (the stu-
dent’s) writing ability, but also
to get some insight into the in-
dividual himself — what he’s
like, what his interests are, that
sort of thing,’ he said.

The essays also will be given
to the faculty advisors of those
students who decide to attend

W&L, Ruscio said. After

reading the essays, the advisor
will be better able to tell the stu-
dent whether he should take a
course in basic English gram-
mar.
There have been a wide range
of responses to the essay, in-
‘cluding several Ben Franklins,
Thomas Jeffersons, Jesus
Christs and even a Donald
Duck.

tion of the essay is the main

Washington and Lee University

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, FEBRUARY 2, 1978

E.C. to question McNider’s tactics

Jim McNider, chairman of
the Student Control Committee,
may be asked to appear at Mon-
day’s Executive Committee
meeting to explain certain pro-
cedural irregularities of his
committee, EC President Jim
Underhill said Tuesday.

Underhill said McNider is in
the habit of pursuing Student
Control matters himself rather
than consulting the whole com-
mittee. Underhill said McNider
is on his own personal crusade

and confirmed reports. that

McNider has been turning
many Student Control matters
over to the EC for honor trials.
Underhill originally said Stu-
dent Control had taped a hear-
ing, but after learning of
MeNider’s denial of doing so
Underhill admitted he had no
first hand knowledge. He said
that McNider had requested
and received a tape recorder
which MeNider wanted to use to
tape a committee hearing
which he thought might later
reveal discrepancies in

testimony serious enough to be
brought before the EC.

MeNider admitted asking
some students if they would
mind having their proceding
recorded, but said no student
agreed to such an arrangement.

MecNider also admitted that
he had asked students caught
for smoking marijuana in the
dormitories to sign a statement
admitting to certain facts in the
case. McNider said the students
signed the statements ‘‘of their
own free will.”’

Minorities given special preference

by Ben Keesee

Minorities, sons of alumni,
and local students are given
what Lewis G. John, Dean of
Students, termed as “special
preference’? when being con-
sidered for admission to
Washington and Lee. In addi-
tion, minorities are given
preferential treatment in the
area of financial aid.

In a recent interview, Dean
John stated that after ap-
plicants deemed academically
qualified are determined,
students identified as ‘‘special
preference’’ category members
are “offered admission without
competition with others (ap-
plicants).”’

When questioned about the
“special preference”’ policy and
its effects, Associate Dean of
Students and Coordinator of the
freshman year, H. Robert
Huntley, replied ‘‘We do iden-
tify them and that’s about all.”’
Huntley did, however, say that
once a ‘‘special preference”
category student is identified,
“We make every effort to ac-
cept him.”

Also, when the admissions
committee considers the ap-
plication of a minority student
Scholastic Aptitude Test score
are played down, while class.
rank and grade point average
are emphasized, Huntley said.
Board scores of minority ap-
plicants are consistently lower
than those of non-minority ap-
plicants, but this difference is
what. he termed a “cultural

phenomena.’’ Huntley said SAT
scores are not considered
reliable indicators of academic
ability and ‘do not reflect
native intelligence.”

Dean John further stated that
Washington and Lee does
‘“‘make some special efforts’’ to

secure attendance of minority
students. When asked for an ex-
ample of those “special ef-
forts,’ Dean John stated that
“blacks do get a more favorable
portion of grant.’’ (Grant refers
to financial aid awarded

Washington and Lee students
are in favor of coeducation ac-
cording to a poll taken by the
Ring-tum Phi Monday. Thirty-
six percent of the student body
participated in the poll in which
56 percent of those voting
favored coeducation.

In the same poll, 55 percent of
the students were unsatisfied
with the social life. Of those who
voted for coeducation, 81 per-
cent were unsatisfied with the
social life while 80 percent of
those who voted against
coeducation were satisfied with
the social life.

Fifty-one percent of the
fraternity members were in
favor of coeducation, while 62
percent of the independents
favored it. At the same time, 67
percent of the independents
were unsatisfied with the social
life yet only 56 percent of frater-
nity men think the social life is
satisfactory.

The seniors were the only

tion. They did so 62-51. The
juniors, sophomore and
freshman classes voted for
coeducation 63-34, 73-59, and
96-48 respectively.

A computation of chi square
showed the results of the survey
to be significant. The chi square
of 5.9 indicates there is only a
two percent chance that the
results are insignificant and do
not reflect the opinion of the en-
tire student body.

In February, 1976 the Board
of Trustees voted unanimously
to remain an all-male institu-
tion. The trustees indicated that
considerations of size, cur-
riculum and_ traditional
character were primary factors
influencing their decision. A
study undertaken indicated
coeducation would require an
increase in the university’s size.
The trustees felt an increase in
the student body should be
avoided. Coeducation, they felt,
would mean a possible change
in the curriculum which would

here. Coeducation would prac-
tically destroy the traditional
nature of Washington and Lee.
Washington and Lee is the na-
tion’s oldest all-male institu-
tion.

In 1975, the faculty voted
53-49-5 recommending that the
trustees adopt coeducation. In
their statement to the trustees
they said, “The faculty, having
considered the impact of
coeducation without regard to
economic considerations,
believe, coeducation would
have a favorable effect upon the
academic program at
Washington and Lee “

Dissenting faculty members
at the time had some _in-
teresting things to say about

betrayal of serious education.”
Coeducation is ‘typical rather
of Soviet Russian and Red
Chinese society.”’ In ‘‘Western

countries...nothing much is ‘at

Colby, who served as CIA
director from 1973 to 1976, told
told of how recent intelligence
in the past years have shocked
Americans more than surprised
them.

Fictional characters like
James Bond have provided
Americans with the image
about intelligence gathering, he
said, but added that the CIA is
now becoming better
understood.

“If the CIA did something
wrong, let’s correct and control
it,” he shouted over the podium,
‘“‘not do away with it because of
some disasterous incidents that
I personally believe were few
and far between “‘

In that light, Colby, a
Princeton and Columbia law
graduate, said that former CIA
Director Richard Helms should
not have been prosecuted or in-
dicted for his false and inac-
curate testimony to a Senate

committee.

As for Frank Snep’s new
book, Decent Interval, which
describes the bungling of the
Saigon evacuation of American
and Vietnamese civilians dur-
ing the final days of the Viet-
nam war, Colby said Snep was

overly critical and that all of the

gentleman,

a factory

 

by Galen Trussell

Mark Bradley, a_ very
atypical senior at Washington
and Lee, has been awarded a
Fulbright scholarship to study
inGermany. .

The Fulbright scholarship is
the most recent of Bradley’s
laurels, but not his most im-
pressive. Bradley is also the

first Rhodes’~ scholar
Washington and Lee has pro-
duced since 1973.

Bradley said he didn’t feel he
was your typical man about
campus, whose social life
centers around fraternities and
grain parties. He admitted he
was “kind of a loner.” Mark
credited his attraction to W&L
not to the social life here but to

the teachers he has had in his
four years here.

“It was the professors here at
W&L that helped me _ get
motivated to do really well,”
Bradley confessed.

Professors Machado and
Dickens were the two out of a
list of about ten teachers
Bradley credited as helping him
the most. Bradley also said that
his being the first member of
his family to go to college added
to his desires to do well.

“The reason I’ve done so well
at Washington and Lee is
because it was such a big deal
for me to go to college,”
Bradley said.

Even with his job at Roanoke
Iron and Bridge Works, where

he puts in about 30 hours a
week, Mark has maintained a
3.8 GPA. He laughingly denied
he was a “‘work-aholic”’.

Being chosen for a Rhodes
scholarship was an incredible
honor Bradley admitted. He
said he felt like he was in a state
of shock when it happened.

“When I learned I had been
selected for the Rhodes, my
first thought was how pleased
all my professors at
Washington and Lee would be,”’
Bradley said.

Bradley began his successful
bid for the Rhodes honor last
year by submitting a 1,000 word
essay about his goals in life. The
Rhodes screening board then

in after causing $1400

damage

A fifth of Wild Turkey
whiskey mixed with an assort-
ment of other mind-expanding
concoctions was what sparked
the much-publicized  sign-
tearing incident last Saturday
night, according to one fo the
students involved.

Police Chief J. A. Kirby said
26 street signs in downtown Lex-
ington had been torn down and
that damage was estimated at
$1,400.

The students, both
Washington and Lee freshmen,
said they only were responsible
for 10 signs.

“I’m not heavy enough to do
all that damage,” one freshman
said.

Both students said they turn-
ed themselves in to the police
and were charged with a viola-
tion of Section 21:25 of the City
Code that states it is unlawful to
damage public property.

The two freshmen said they
were sorry for the vandalism
and that they were willing to ac-
cept the consequences.

“Whether it was right or
wrong, it still was illegal,’’ one
of the freshmen said.

The case was brought before
the Executive Committee, but

was forwarded to Student Con-
trol. The hearing will be held on
Thursday, according to the two
students.

Michael T. Cleary, ” senior
member of the Student Control
Committee, refused to discuss
what, if any, punishments will
be assessed.

Both freshmen will testify in
Lexington General District
Court on Feburary 28.

RtP Series on Fraternities

Frat houses deteriorating

3rd _ in a series

by Randy Smith

Complaints from alumni have
pressured the Fraternity In-
spection Committee to recom-
mend that a chedklist be sent to
each of Washington and Lee’s
fraternities, on a monthly basis,
to insure that interior and ex-
terior maintenance work be:
performed on fraternity houses.
Failure to comply with the
maintenance requests on the
checklists will result in punitive
action.

Concern for the structural
condition of many of W&L’s
fraternities has also been
registered by the school’s ad-
ministration, town residents,
and a fire and safety survey
conducted by an independent in-
vestigation firm.

The fire and life safety report,
conducted by the National Loss
Control Service Corporation
last fall, said in part: ‘‘The
respect for fellow students’ life
and safety is very lax...”

In a strongly worded conclu-
sion, the survey went on to say
that ‘‘the present conditons of
the fifteen fraternity houses
visited are sucb, that in no way
can a reasonable level of life
safety be assured for the
students.”

Dr. Thomas C. Imeson, chair-
man of ‘the recently formed
Fraternity Inspection Commit-
tee, said that the past ‘‘grievous
neglect”’ of fraternity members
for their chapter houses has

 

resulted in structrual damage
and deterioration. ‘‘We’re not
interested in dictating to frater-
nities how they protect the
health and welfare of their
members,” Dr. Imeson explain-
ed, “but we must assure
minimum safety standards.’
“The Alumni Board express-
ed a real interest’’ in the ap-
parent structural deterioration
of many of W&L’s fraternities,
said Dan Murphy, Assistant
Dean of Students and Coor-
dinator of Fraternity Affairs.
“They felt that something
should be done (about the struc-

tural condition of many frater-
nity houses) because the frater-
nities are a reflection on
Washington and Lee.”’

Dean Murphy characterized
past fraternity maintenance ef-
forts as ‘‘somewhat negligent in
the appearance and upkeep of
their houses.”’

Four different options were
reportedly considered by the
Fraternity Inspection Commit-
tee to remedy chapter house
conditions: (1) do nothing and
let the present structures col-
lapse from misues; (2) turn

It was ‘“‘no declaration of in-
dependence,”’
said, but the open hearing on
the honor system in Lewis Hall
Tuesday was an opportunity for
law students to express their
dissatisfaction with honor trial
proceedings.

The main complaints focused
on the EC’s procedure of con-
ducting inquisitorial hearings
as opposed to adversary hear-
ings, the absolute honor viola-
tion sanctions and the appeal
procedure.

Some specific White Book
changes were also suggested.
One student said that a white
book section which states that
the EC recognizes no physical
or geographic power. The stu-
dent said that if he chose to lie,
cheat or steal in Illinois he
should not be subject to EC
discretion. He suggested that
the White Book make it clear
that the EC only have jurisdic-
tion on the W&L campus.

The same student excoriated
the appeal procedure. He said
‘the fact that a student does not
have an honor trial go on his
written record if only the EC
hears it, but does have a trial go
on record if he appeals for a
public Student Body Hearing is
a deterrent for appeal. He said.
it would be equivalent to the
Supreme Court requiring a
$1,000 fee to hear an appeal. He
suggested that all trials be off
the record.

as Derek Swope .

The law student went on to
say that the White Book does
not include any safeguard
against double jeapordy. If new
evidence came up a year or so
later, a persons could be
retired, yet key witnesses may
have graduated. He suggested a
White Book change which would
require that a student could not
be tried twice for the same of-
fense.

Another student said that he
thinks the EC has too much

E.C. gives its OK
to M.C. beer blast

by Randy Smith

Tentative plans for a nickle-
beer night, to be sponsored by
the Mock Convention Commit-
tee sometime in March, were
approved by by the Executive
Committee Monday night.

Mock Convention’s request
was merely for permission to
have the beer function, not to
solicit funds from the EC. The
nickle-beer party is budgeted
for $75.

Representatives from the
Mock Convention Committee
said that the purposes of the
beer night are to ‘generate in-
terest’’ for the 1980 Convention
and ‘‘get as many people involv-
ed as possible’’ in the initial
planning of the mock political
convention — still two years
away.

In the only other action dur-
ing the EC’s brief Monday night
meeting, Jackie Boyden and
new law school representative
Tom Healy clarified the law
school’s stance with regard to
Washington and Lee’s honor
system.

Miss Boyden explained that
the law students are ‘‘not ad-
vocating separation” from the
undergraduates, but want
“procedural changes’ in the
manner in which honor cases
are conducted. The Student Bar
Association has formed a steer-
ing committee to review pro-
cedural reforms’ Miss Boyden

said.

The suggestions of the steer-
ing committee will be referred
to a ‘“‘student-wide’’ committee
for additional comments; both
sets of recommendations will
then be sent to the EC.

Healy added that the SBA’s
suggestions for improving the
honor trial procedures should
not be viewed as ‘‘an attempt to

take over the honor system, but.

an effort to improve it ‘‘

Jim Underhill and George
Griffin, president and vice
president of the EC, respective-
ly, will be involved in the SBA
reform suggestions, it was
noted.

power. He suggested that the
executive, judicial and
legislative powers which are all
invested in the EC be broken up
among three student organiza-
tions, one of which would be
soley responsible for honor
trials.

These, however, were the on-
ly substantive changes sug-
gested. Most of the meeting was
involved with clearing up
misconceptions which law
students have about the honor
system. Many law _ students
thought that honor defendents
were not presented with
evidence against them before
the honor trial, were not
presented with charges before
the trail and did not screen out
bad cases. Some even thought
the EC gave less than 24 hours
notice before a trial.

Actually, the EC is required
to give at least 24 hours notice,
and is in the habit of giving
more time if necessary. Also,

 

when defendants are told of the
honor trial, they are given an
explanation of the charges both
orally and in writing and are
given copies of all physical
evidence against them. Futher-
more, before this process can
procede, a screening process
does take place, in which three
EC members decided whether
there is enough cause to bring a
case to trial.

Because of the many
misconceptions evinced at the

‘meeting, one law student said
he has strong feelings that

much of the dissatisfaction
shown by law students toward
the honor system is a result of
ignorance of standard honor
trial procedures. Many students
agreed with him, saying they
had not been properly informed
of the honor system during
orientation.

Tom Healy, the new EC law
representative, suggested that
the EC present a program to

law freshmen during orienta-
tion that would help clear up
such misunderstandings. The
idea seemed to be universally
accepted and Swope, head of
the Board of Governors, said
the honor system presentation
will be incorporated into the
freshman orientation program

next year.
There were some highly
philosophical arguements

discussed at the meeting. For
instance, one student asked
“What is a peer?” She said
that the EC is not really a group
of her peers because she is
aobut five years older than
most of them. Given tbat an
honor violation is basically
whatever is deemed
dishonorable by the student
generation involved, she said
she wondered how the younger
undergraduates could judge her
actions.

Other law students disagreed
with her point of view, saying
they thought undergraduates
and graduates probably have
the same view of honor. It was
more a disagreement between
them as to what methods they
should use to conduct honor
trials, many law students said.
Law students seemed to agree
that they prefer an adversary
trial in which the defendant can
be advised by a_ specially-
trained third year law student.
They also want more time to be
able to prepare a defense; a
matter of two or three days
rather than one day, said one
Lewis Hall man.

Law students also seemed
distressed by the lack of
codification of the White Book.
One particularly animated stu-
dent identified as John Frazier
said the EC is relying too much
on “‘folkways’’ rather than on
precedent. He said such
reliance left students with no
way to “pattern their conduct.”’

Okay, here’s a first rate

and who also think that if
classical music is dull, chamber
music is the dullest of the lot.
You are cordially challenged to
listen to Schubert’s ‘Trout”’

«shearing any of these pieces that
‘you will discover a new joy in
};music you never knew before.

UT Plans return to the 1890’s
in Spring program

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor

Dr. Albert Gordon, head of
the Department of Fine Arts,
has announced tentative plans
for the spring term, Drama 139
(total theatre) course to be of-
fered this coming April. A
meeting has been announced
for next Monday, February 6, at
3:30 in the Troubadour Theatre.

Dr. Gordon, who will be direc-
ting all the shows in this pro-
gram, is starting a tradition
that many hope will be repeated
in succeeding years in Lex-
ington — that is, summer
theatre for the many tourists
who visit Lexington during the
summer. All those who sign up
for Drama 139 will have the op-
tion of staying in Lexington for
roughly the first half of the sum-
mer, and continue to present
the plays.

The point must be stressed
that there is no obligation to
stay in Lexington over the sum-
mer, once one has signed up for
the course. The grade in Gor-
don’s course will be based upon
work in the six weeks; money,
in the form of a_ proposed
“profit-sharing” plan, will be
the incentive for the summer
part of the program.

The general theme of the spr-
ing presentation will be
remembering theatre of the
1890’s. The Drama Department
will attempt to bring back the
flavor of the period through
three plays. Opening the season
will be Little Mary Sunshine,
the well known musical parody
of all those ‘Student Prince’’-
type operettas of the age. This
play will be rehearsed with an
eye to opening before gradua-
tion, for the W&L community.
The two other productions will
open in June: Rip Van Winkle, a

famous 19th century rendition
of the Washington Irving story;
and Dirty Work at the
Crossroads, a_ typical
melodrama of the time. All the
productions will be presented in
the Troubadour Theatre, which
will be air-conditioned for the
summer.

Tom Ziegler’s impressive
talents of Beaux’ Strategem
fame will be called into action
once again for this project. The
attempt will be to turn the
Troubadour into a Lexington
variety theatre of that time.
Upon completion, it will be
christened ‘‘The Henry Street
Light Opera and Melodrama
Company.”

Dr. Gordon has sent out a
special call for musicians to fill
the proposed small orchestra,
women to fill the necessary

parts, and interested backstage
workers. It should be noted that
those who want to do technical
work in the course and no ac-
ting, will find more work
available than ever before.
Special areas which will need
large staffs during the term
itself will be public relations-
publicity, and all the regular
backstage crews. Even with
two of the shows technically
ready by the end of classes.

This is an exciting opportuni-
ty to help what very well may
become a yearly Lexington
tradition...But help is certainly
needed, from actors to poster-
hangers. Even if you are still
uncertain, go to the meeting
next Monday and find out more.
If you are unable to attend in-
formation may be obtained
from Dr. Gordon at 463-9111,
ext. 351.

Washington and Lee University Theatre will present Eugene

America’s premier dramatist. The production will open Saturday,
Feb. 4. Performances will be offered each night through Thursday,
Feb. 9. Curtain time is 8 p.m., and reservations should be made in
advance with the theatre directly, 463-9111, ext. 371. O’Neill’s play
treats the themes of incest and child-murder — so controversial
when ‘Desire’ was first produced in 1924 that it was banned in
many cities. Even now, however, ‘the power of the play has not
diminished,’ according to Chris Willett, the director. Willett is
directing the play as his senior drama thesis.
Cable Nine: new
schedule announced

Two new shows, two already
established shows and specials
throughout the year highlight
the new Cable Nine schedule for
this term.

According to Tom Williams,
production co-manager of the
student television station, the
new sc edule is an attempt to
appeal to both Washington and
Lee students and townspeople.

Williams said the schedule
has not changed that much
from this past term, but an ef-
fort has been made to provide
stability.

“Last term we had some
shows, produced in our studios,
that would be ready one week
and then not the next. We have
shows this term that we can
count on every week,’’ said
Williams.

Rob Hedelt, program director

“One of these is the ‘Cable

A UNIVERSAL RELEASE

a:

by Mark Mainwaring
Associate Music Director
WLUR-FM
This week in Mainstream,
you’ll find a counterpoint to last
week’s favorable Elvis Costello
review, plus information on a
concert that should leave ears

ringing for days.
My Aim Is True.
Elvis Costello Columbia JC
35037
Costello’s lyrics are only

average, the instrumental work
is fair, and the vocals are ir-
ritating. My Aim Is True is,
quite simply, one of the most
overrated records in recent
memory. Why is this man get-
ting so much media exposure?
Reason A: He has an odd
stage presence and is downright
funny-looking. Obviously, this
isn’t the only reason (after all,
WLUR Music Director Leslie
Gillen isn’t famous yet), so we
move along to Reason B:
Costello sounds a lot like the se-
cond most overrated artist in
recent memory, Bruce Springs-
teen. Reason C: His music is
“real,” it ‘“‘comes from the
streets.” Music from the streets
is big these days, even if it’s not
played very well. Reason D: All
the previous reasons (especial-
ly the resemblance to Springs-
teen) have combined to attract
the support of the powers that
be in rock-journalism, and par-

ticularly the New York-based
media. The resultant hype cam-
paign has convinced a lot of

otherwise intelligent people
that Elvis Costello is the future
of rock and roll. I don’t pretend
to know what the future of the
genre may be, but this ain’t it.
My Aim Is True is a waste of
good vinyl. Concert Note: Ted
Nugent will appear at the
Roanoke Civic Center this Fri-
day, February 3, at8 P.M. Since
his emergence at age sixteen
with the Detroit-based Amboy

 

Dukes, Nugent has been putting
out some of the best hard-
hitting rock around, and his.
concerts are high energy affairs
to say the least. Says Nugent of
his audience: “If they ain’t
foaming at the mouth after ten
minutes then we’ve screwed
up.”’ The show will have the ad-
ded attraction of two first-rate
opening acts, Sammy Hagar
and Golden Earring. For true
rock and rollers, this is a show
not to be missed.

 

In
Your
Pit

by Galen Trussell

We've got a really big show
for you music enthusiasts this
Friday in the Cockpit. The Se-
cond Hand Band will be pickin’
and scratchin’ for your musical
delight into the wee hours.

Plans have been made to con-
tact several bands out of the
Lynchburg area to play in the
Cockpit. I say plans because
nobody on the UCC has been
able to borrow my news editor’s

Last weekend Washington
and Lee might have experienc-
ed a new and totally unknown
phenomena: two good bar
bands in a weekend. I realize
some of you may scoff at me
and say: There couldn’t have
been two good bar bands around
Washington and Lee in one
weekend, BUT I counter you by
saying neither the Cockpit, nor
SAB, were ever responsible for
them.

Yes, folks, believe it or not,
I’m giving the SAB a pat on the
back for acutally using student
funds to get a good rock band.

cellent southern boogie at the

date shook me back to reality
and I was good humored to hear
the band playing ‘‘Jessica”’ lick
for lick like the Brothers, God
rest their souls. It sounded like
they had come back from the
dead. This was the extent of my
memory of that party.

Dan Scott deserves credit for
getting an excellent band, The
Allstars, in the Cockpit last Fri-
day. How Dan ever got them
down there when the Cockpit’s
budget is so, so lean because of
such a big overhead I’ll never
know, but the band was tight.
The Allstars did mostly their
own creations, and the dollar
cover charge didn’t seem to
deter too many people. I ask
you benevolent reader, don’t
you think the EC should start
letting us charge a cover more
often for that kind of entertain-
ment?

Swimmers push
record to 6-1

For the 32nd time since 1929,
the Washington and Lee swim-
mers defeated William and
Mary, winning 70-43 last Satur-
day in the Cy Twombly pool.
The W&L win avenged a 1976-77
Indian victory, and gives W&L
a 6-1 record in 1977-78.

Now in his twelfth season as
head W&L swimming coach,
Bill Stearns labels this edition
of the Generals ‘‘the best since
he’s been here.’ Not only are
the mermen again very strong
in the freestyle events, but they
also have more depth this year
than ever before. That depth
was evident in the W&M meet
at W&L won nine of the 13
events.

Senior John Hudson was a tri-
ple winner capturing first in the
1000 free (10:39.78), then com-
ing right back in the next event
— the 200 free (1:49.17), and
also winning the 500 free
(4:54.52). Freshman diving
standout Jay Diesing won both
the one (151.19) and three meter
(214.60) diving events.

Single winners for W&L in-
cluded Keith Romich with a
new school record in the 200 fly
(2:02.29), Seott Duff in the 100
free (50.59), David Kent in the
200 individual medley (2:06.93),
and Bob Newcomb in the 50 free

(22.93). Stearns points to the
strength in the diving events —
freshman George Irvine was se-
cond in the one meter and third
in the three meter vs. W&M,
and depth throughout the lineup
as the factors separating this
years’ team from other very
successful W&L teams.

Transfer David Kent gives
W&L a consistent threat in the
individual medley and
backstroke along with Drew
Pillsbury, while senior Peter
Meem has done well in the
breastroke all season. Kent
broke the W&L 200 backstroke
record held by Pillsbury on
Saturday (2:04.49) but was edg-
ed out by W&L’s Jack Phillips
for first (2:04.11).

Stearns is quick to point out
that the finishes of the last two
W&L teams — 8th nationally
and six All-Americans in 1975-76
and 9th nationally and five All-
Americans in 1976-77, will be
difficult to surpass this March
2-4in Wheaton, III.

Kent is not eligible to compete
in the nationals due to transfer
status, and the lack of a strong
medley relay team will hurt the
Generals chances to move up.
But Stearns vows that the team
will give it their best to do just

Grapplers defeat
VMI Keydets

by Mark Paterson

For the second consecutive
year the wrestling Generals
won the city championship as
they smashed Lexington rival
VMI 27-9 on Wednesday even-
ing. The victory, which raised
the team’s record to 4-2, came
on the heels of last week's
equally impressive victory over
Eastern Mennonite and helped
restore any confidence the team
might have lost on their recent
trips through the Carolinas.

After losing the first two mat-
ches at 126 and 134 pounds (both
teams forfeited at 118), the
Generals came alive with their
dynamic middleweight power
and took control of the match.
First, Ray Gross, one of the top
wrestlers on the team at 142
pounds and Jim Flippen (150)
registered pins, turning a 6-0
deficit into a 12-6 lead. Then, the
Generals scored 6 more points
at 158 pounds when tri-captain
Ed Rodger’s opponent suffered
an accidental injury and had to
default the match. With the
score now standing at 18-6
freshman Dave Stoeffel iced the

match with a convincing 12-1

victory at 167 pounds. Following
Stoeffel’s strong showing Tom
Oxendine (177) and tri-captain
Dan Kniffen (190) ran the
Generals victory streak to six
before the Keydets scored their
final victory in the heavyweight
match.

Following the victory over
VMI, Coach Gary Franke took
several of his wrestlers to the
highly competitive Virginia
state meet at Old Dominion
University. Competing against
such powerful Division I schools
as William and Mary, Virginia,
and Virginia Tech the Generals
gave a most creditable showing
with Ray Gross winning his 11th
match of the year and Ed
Rodgers his 12th and 13th.

With the team’s confidence
and enthusiasm at their peaks,
the Generals now prepare for a
difficult part of their schedule.
Following the Jan. 31 meet
against powerful Liberty Bap-
tist the team competes in the
Pembrook Invitational on
Saturday, Feb. 4. The Generals
return home on Tuesday, Feb. 7
to battle conference rival
Hampden-Sydney.

WE&L nips Lynchburg
in final minutes

by Ken Mastrilli

W&L co-captain Bob Forlen-
za hit four foul shots and made a
crucial steal in the last minute
and a half of play and Pat Den-
nis, W&L’s other co-captain,
scored 21 points to lead the
W&L basketball Generals in a
78-74 victory over Lynchburg
College here Monday night. It
may have been W&L’s best

game of the year.
Forlenza, who sparked the
Generals with eight points in a

One-point victory over
Hampden-Sydney earlier this
season, stole an errant Lyn-
chburg pass during a Hornet
stall and streaked down court.
He almost hit an amazing layup
despite being clobbered by two
Lynchburg defenders.

It looked like a two-shot foul,
but Forlenza was only given a
1-1 situation. It didn’t really
matter, however, because
Forlenza calmly hit both shots
despite the electrifying tension

 

caused by the screaming of
1,000 Lynchburg and W&L fans.

‘With nine seconds left in the
game, Forlenza again made the
big play. He came up with a
loose ball after a flurry of shots
by Lynchburg, any of which
could have tied the game at 76-
all. Forlenza was immediately
fouled again, and he iced the
game for the Generals with two
more shots from the charity
stripe.

Forlenza, who says he shoots
“thousands of foul shots in prac-
tice’ said he wasn’t really sur-
prised that he made them. ‘“‘It’s
all a matter of getting your
rhythm,”’ he chuckled, ‘‘then its
no problem.”

One problem the Generals did
have was making their first
basket of the game. They went
the first three minutes without
making a shot’ missing tbeir
first seven attempts. It looked
like they might get blown out of
their own gym as Lynchburg
jumped to a 8-0 lead.

“But we didn’t get impa-
tient,’’ said head coach Verne
Canfield, ‘‘We know Lynchburg
is an emotional, up and down
team and I’m really satisfied
with the way we came back.”’

Canfied was especially pleas-
ed with the play of his ‘‘super-
subs’”’ Bob Smitherman and
Bruce Williams, who always
manage to get the Generals go-
ing when they come in the
game. Williams scored eight
points, all layups off of great
passes from Mike Wenke and
Bob Forlenza, the two point
guards who played superbly.
Smitherman came in, perform-
ed well and drew four Lyn-
chburg fouls in the space of
about two minutes, which
enabled the Generals to get into
the one-and-one situation.

Leunig, who up to this point
seemed to have been the forgot-
ten man, played probably his
best game of the year. He
scored 16 points while pulling

Piranian attends coaches
convention in Boston

by Phillip Timp

Rolf Piranian, the amiable
second-year head soccer coach
at W&L, recently spent an en-
joyable and informative three
days in Boston attending the
38th annual National Soccer
Coaches Association Conven-
tion.

Piranian, one of about 500
coaches from around the coun-
try making the trip on Jan. 18,
attended the convention for the
first time and was impressed
both by what he saw and by
what he learned.

Meeting a number of very
successful college coaches
whom he has admired for years
is what Piranian considers the
highlight of the weekend con-
vention.

Piranian said he was able to
meet such reknowned soccer
coaches as Jerry Yeagley, who
guided Indiana University to se-
cond place in the National Col-
legiate Athletic Association soc-
cer finals, and Lincoln Phillips,

Howard University’s winning
coach.

Piranian said that he also at-
tended several coaching clinics
and was fortunate to hear three
lecutes given by Charles
Hughes, the director of soccer

coaching in England. He
discussed modern coaching
techniques.

In addition, Piranian was
able to learn how other coaches
recruit players, and run their
programs. He added that he
picked up some tips from the
clinics which he will apply to his
coaching strategy. Pirianiam
said he learned of some man-to-
man defensive tactics which he
hopes will help his team better
its 6-10 record of the past
season.

Piranian said he also learned
of the psychological aspects of
soccer which he hadn't given
much thought to prior to the
clinics. He said he plans to app-
ly psychological thinking to his
coaching efforts next year.

Although he learned a _ lot,
Piranian said some of the lec-
tures he heard convinced him
that various soccer techniques
he has stressed to his players at
W&L have been correct.

In addition to the many
clinics and lectures, Piranian
said that a number of other ac-
tivities kept the coaches busy.
Playoff formats and possible
rule changes were discussed,
business meetings were held,
and exhibits were set up by
various manufacturing com-
panies trying to sell equipment.

An awards banquet was also
held honoring the past-season’s
All-American soccer players.
Piranian said that one All-
American from the
Elizabethtown College soccer
team began hitchhiking Friday
at 5 p.m. along the snow-
covered highway from
Elizabethtown, Penn., and ar-
rived in Boston at 2 a.m. Satur-
day so that he could receive his
award at the banquet.

 
 

 

Cagers dismember Eagles

by Mark Mitchell

The Washington and Lee
basketball team gave the
Bridgewater Eagles a lesson in
team basketball while
thrashing the Eagles 105-77.

It was the second consecutive
105 point game for the Generals,
who played well in front of a
sparse crowd of approximately
150 people. W&L did not even
have to use an extraordinary
amount of defensive presssure
in order to score their 105 points
since their new offense was
working so well.

In the new set up, Pat Dennis
played point guard. The offense
got the ball into the middle of
the Bridgewater zone with
amazing consistency. Even
when the shot was missed, the
Generals usually came up with
the offensive rebound. Thus,
even though the Generals shot
only 44 percent for the game,
they scored most of the time
they came down the court. They
put up more shots than

Bridgewater 90 to 64, and outre-
bounded them 62 to 37.

The game was close only
when it was 7-6, Washington and
Lee leading. Then, Ardith Col-
lins scored two unanswered
baskets to give the Generals an
11-6 edge. The Generals main-
tained that five point margin
until there were just under ten
minutes left in the half. The
Generals then switched to a
half-court pressure defense
which totally overwheomed the
2-16 Eagles. The W&L lead
ballooned to fifteen points at
41-26 before the Generals mer-
cifully stopped their pressing.
The cagers went into the locker
room with a comfortable ten
point margin 47-37.

After intermission, the
Eagles were able to cut the lead
to eight at 57-49, but were
unable to launch any serious
threat.

They could not stop the
Generals from scoring and con-

trolling the offensive boards.
Specifically, they could not stop
Larry Meyer, who finished with
25 points and 12 rebounds and
Ardith Collins who finished with
19 points and 17 rebounds. Col-
lins played an inspired game,
jumping out of bounds to make
several saves of loose balls.
Meyer was unstopable when he
got the ball down low, hitting on
11 of 19 attempts from the floor,
including an amazing double-
pump shot.

In short, it was a good victory
to have coming into the Lyn-
chburg game. The Generals
played with enthusiasm and ex-
ecuted a new offensive pattern
amazing well, reflecting not on-
ly the fact that practices have
been very intensive, but also the
improvement in Dennis’ ball-
handling and passing skills.

Dennis had only 4 tunrovers,
while scoring 17 points and
dishing out 5 assists.

 

 

Generals beat Hornets

(continued from page 6)
down seven rebounds.

Most importantly, he kept the
Generals in the game for the
first three quarters, scoring
when All-American candidate
Pat Dennis couldn't.

Dennis, although he scored 21
points and was the game’s
leading scorer had a streaky
night from the floor, sometimes
forcing shots, but also bringing
the crowd to its feet with 30 foot
jump shots.

Sophomore Larry Meyers,
who finished with 15 points and
9 rebounds, helped the Generals
pull out to a 37-36 halftime lead
by scoring 10 points in the first
ten minutes. Moreover, he
helped Ardith Collins keep the
ODAC’s leading rebounder, Ed
Schechterly, from dominating
the boards and clogging up the
middle. Collins had eight re-
bounds and put in a nice turn-
around jump shot over the
outstrectched arms of the 6’9”’
Schechterly at an importnat

point in the game.
The Hornets held the lead
throughout the first three

quarters except for the few
times the Generals were able to
grab a one or two point ad-
vantage.

Then lLynchburg’s Wayne
Davis and W&L’s Pat Dennis
started trading baskets. The
Hornets played the entire se-
cond half without the services of
their star forward Crawford,
who had been on a 30 point per
game scoring binge in his last
couple of games. In the first
half Crawford had scored eight
of the Hornet’s first 17 points,
but then apparently he re-
injured his ankle which has
been bothering him all year. He
limped up and down the court
until Lynchburg coach Wayne
Proffitt took him out of the
game in the first half.

Lynchburg still managed to
hold the lead most of the game
without him, but it’s the end of
the game that counts and Lyn-
chburg began to tire and get in-

to foul trouble. Coach Proffitt
only substituted when he had to.
W&L’s coach Canfield sub-
situted every three or four
minutes with the likes of ‘‘T.J.”’
who made a nice move inside on
the towering Schechterly.
Schechterly went for the block
on the dipsy-doodle layup by
Jeffries’ but got nothing but a
sore hand from slamming it
against the backboard.

The Wayne Davis-Pat Dennis
matchup proved to be the
game’s offensive highlight.
With Davis dogging Dennis all
over the court, he made Pat
force some shots. Much to
Davis’ frustration, however,
Dennis would hit some of those
patented long bombs.

The Generals are now 6-1 in
ODAC play. Lynchburg slipped
to 4-2. The Generals with a win
over ODAC foe Eastern Men-
nonite here tonight, could wrap
up that all-important first place
inthe ODAC.

In the ODAC tournament, to —

be played in March, the first-
seeded team, probably W&L,
plays the fourth place team.

stake in education for women
beyond high school.’’ One pro-
fessor believed college age
women are more prone than
men to “dwell on  pseudo-
philosophical and...moralistic
aspects of...problems”’ and are
“unwilling to deal with tangible
elements.”’ Finally, a professor
summed up the sentiments of
his collegues by saying
“teaching women would be ex-
ceptionally difficult and pain-
ful.”’

‘Special preference”

(continued from page 1)

without obligation as opposed to
loan, which must be repaid.)
John also said that grants are
often awarded to minority
students without the usual
academic stipulations placed on
non-minority student scholar-
ships.

In a telephone interview, Van
Haigler Pate, Assistant Dean of
Students and Director of Stu-
dent Financial Aid, confirmed
John’s statement about
academic stipulations saying
that in spite of the large por-
tions of grant awarded to
minority students, ‘‘There’s not
really an academic stipula-
tion.”

A non-minority financial aid
recipient risks having his grant
reduced significantly if his
grades fall below a two-point
average.

Pate also stated that the pro-
tion of grant awarded to any
student is based entirely on
financial need, and not race or
ethnic origin. He said that the
majority of minority students
are from substantially disad-
vantaged backsgrounds.

In reference to the ‘‘special

ug?

preference” given to minority
applicants, Dean Huntley ex-
plained that it is justified by the
valuable diversity of
backgroupd it aids in lending
the student body. He claimed
the administration feels
preferential treatment of sons
of alumni is justified as an ex-
pression of gratitude for the in-
valuable role alumni play in the
financial support of Washington

and Lee. Lexington and
Rockbridge County area
residents are given what

Huntley termed ‘‘a break in tui-
tion,” in addition, to ‘special
preference” category status.
He explained this policy as a
‘‘public relations action’ which
fulfills the University’s ‘‘obliga-
tion to the community.”

Asked if efforts to recruit
minority students could result
in cases of reverse discrimina-
tion, Dean Huntley acknowledg-
ed the danger of that possibility,
but said, ‘‘I have never known
of any student who didn’t get
here simply because there was
a less qualified Italian, black or
Indian who entered at that stu-
dent’s expense. I say that flat
out.”

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Antibody or Anti-body?

The Admissions Committee is a school’s antibody. It is supposed
to fight off the disease of quality applicant decline. Yet, this year’s
Admissions department has failed to do so, as indicated by the
virulent 40 percent drop in applications. And that is only the official
estimate. One Admissions Committee faculty member has told the
Ring-tum Phi that the number of applications has plummetted by
56 percent.

No matter what Admissions people say, a decline of that
magnitude will affect the quality of next year’s freshman class. As
Dave McLean, student member of the Admissions Committee,
pointed out, W&L has traditionally been a back-up school for
students rejected by the Ivy Leagues. He believes that much of the
admissions slump can be attributed to prospective Ivy Leaguers’
unwillingness to fill out a new 500 word essay question. His argue-
ment seems logical because there are many schools of W&L’s
caliber which have less demanding forms.

But don’t believe the essay is the only reason the number of ap-
plications and the quality of the applicants are down. The quality of
applicants (as measured by SAT scores) has been falling for years.
While declining scores is a national trend, W&L’s SATs over the
past 10 years have dropped by 70 points, while the nation’s have
dropped by 50 points. And, while Ken Ruscio says this year’s SATs
are up, it must be remembered that a large portion of those
students who have submitted their SAT scores so far are early ad-
mission candidates. Early admission applicants normally have
significantly higher SAT scores than students who turn in applica-
tions near deadline time.

Over the same time period in which quality of applicants has
been declining, the number of applicants has also dropped off
significantly. While W&L used to reject more than half its ap-
plicants, it now accepts close to 60 percent.

Declining numbers and declining quality are related. It is like the
formation of a vortex: Watered down numbers of applicants start
the momentum of the vortex until W&L is ultimately pulled down
into the vacuum of declining quality. For, no matter what the
caliber of teaching is, it is ultimately the intelligence of individual
students which determines how effective that instruction can be.
But before W&L can aviod the vortex of declining standards, tradi-
tional admission criteria must change.

The Admission Committee should still act as the school’s an-
tibody. But its traditional stance ‘“‘anti’’ only to one type of body
should change; women should be allowed into W&L. Besides open-
ning up a new pool of quality female applicants, more men would
apply here. Ever since W&L started worrying about declining
numbers, it has sent a survey to those who were accepted but decid-
ed not to come. And every year the major reason for rejecting
W&L has been the lack of not because they were accepted by
another school. Not because they decided to take a year But
because this school doesn’t accept women.

Well it’s time this school enter the 20th Century; time this school
accept women. They’re here on Earth. They live. They breathe.
And yes, Board of Trustees, they even think. What’s more, they
would improve the academic quality of W&L by attracting more
male applicants and by adding their own intellectual powers which
Administration officials, faculty members, and students too often
calumniate.

Responses to editorial outcry

Law News editor replies

Dear Editor:

Your honor editorial in last
week’s issue of the Ring-tum
Phi may have created a
misconception regarding the
results of the Law News honor
survey. The article seemed to
portray law school dissatisfac-
tion with the present honor
system as a product of a belief
that trial by the EC is not a trial
by ‘‘a jury of peers.”’ If the Law
News survey is a valid sampl-
ing, concern over whether
honor trials are before our
peers is, at best, minimal. By
emphasizing this minor ques-
tion, you have given undue at-
tention to an aspect of the pro-
blem that is capable of eliciting
emotional, rather than reason-
ed, responses.

As reflected in the survey, the
law school’s dissatisfaction
with the honor system focuses
primarily the question of
fairness. The fairness question
involves concern over ambigui-
ty in standards to guide con-
duct, concern over procedural
problems, and concern over
consequences of conviction.

Law school sentiment sup-
porting a separate honor
system reflects a desire to be
governed by a. fairer system,
not fear that a trial before the
EC will not be before a jury of
‘peers. The principal question is
fairness, not separation or

juried of peers. Future discus- _

sion about the honor system

might be more fruitful if
fairness was the focus.

Virtuous
qualities
desired

Dear Editor:

Often I have sat in my room
pondering upon the virtuous
qualities desirable in a woman,
even upon the gentle methods
ideally I would use to enchant
and bequile a lovely child into
going out with me; that is, if I
had the riches, and the guts. Of
course, I would like to make it
perfectly clear, however, that
my pondering takes up nowhere
near 30 percent of my wakeful
hours, nor any of my conversa-

tion, otherwise my thoughts .

would.greatly infringe upon my
academic duties. No, these
revelations only come to me
when I have become totally
disenchanted with my studies,
or else when I have reached the
pits of mental anguish.

Anyway, to those of us of the
weaker sex who are awkward,

immature, unobrusive, and just
plain chicken, the situation is
hopeless. We sit alone in our
rooms night after night waiting
for that one in a million chance
that a beautiful gir] will walk up
the stairs, look into our eyes,
and FLASH! ecstasy prevails.
Our lives will have meaning
again.

Impossible.

Are there any miraculous
remedies for those of us trapped
by our own _ inadequacies
without female companion-
ship? I doubt it. Let us look at
the facts sifted from a typical
survey of stereotypical women.
One, there are no brave, new,
liberated women who walk
down the street with an all con-
quering glint in their eyes and a
pert “‘je ne sais quoi’’ in their
step; none who will assert
themselves and lead us poor,
cowering fools aright, nor even
any who will make a simple
telephone call to help remedy
an evil situation. NO! It ap-
pears that 90 percent or so of the
women are sheep who go to par-
ties they hate, and date people
who make them sick to their
stomachs. Why? Simply
because it’s expected of them,
cause it’s the ‘‘in’’ thing to do.
They must join the crowd; to be
ostracized (no matter how un-
conciously) is a horrible fate.
Besides, they can’t think of
anything better to do.

Who could ever find a good
book to read where they come
from? There certainly are no
facilities for any physical ac-
tivities; it would be impossible
to get a volleyball game going.
The flicks in that vicinity of
Virginia are dull and
disgusting, even more so than
their prospective dates. Face it,

Letters to Editor

(continued from page 8)

the poor women are stuck in a
city where nothing’s happening.

Unfortunately, the women
aren’t the only ones in such bad
straits, there truly isn’t very
much going on in Lexington,
either; except those cursed frat
parties, also one could always
lounge around the Cockpit to
wait for a good band. While liv-
ing in this limbo, almost
everyone seems to have a
strange desire to be around peo-
ple of the opposite sex, which
I'll call normalcy. Meanwhile,
they also enjoy complaining
about any thing that does or
does not occur during their
monotony, which action I will
classify as a spoiled attitude.
Why compalin? Perfection is
not just around the corner. All
things considered, we chose the
life we now lead; and we can un-
choose it, if we so desire; or we
can create from it something a
little more appreciated by our
own senses.

Some necessary changes are
blatantly obvious (a change in
attitude, for example, as my
father once said, ‘‘Don’t be a
loser just because everyone else
is.”’) If girls don’t like parties
they should suggest someplace
else for their dates to take
them, and create a location for
mingling. I’m sure the Fairfax
Lounge could be used to discuss
the virtues of Bertolt Brecht
and Karl Marx. Maybe they
could recruit some boys for
some sporting activities, like a

volleyball match. A committee
should be formed to organize
mixers and other asexual
events between campuses. And
most important, women must
have the strength of their con-
victions to go on a hike instead
of to a party, become a
vegetarian, or to do what
pleases them with who pleases
them. Life is not a bed of roses,
but if you do what you want to
you can’t complain. Men are
awkward, immature, _in-
considerate, indifferent,
shallow, selfish and_ totally
tedious. This just means that
women must work all the
harder employing all their
charms and virtues which they
possess in such abundance to
reform us hapless fools.

As for me, life continues. I re-
main the quiet, considerate,
bouyant, boyishly handsome
young man I always was. Liv-
ing in the dreams I always lived
in. Let others find themselves,
for my life will never be fulfill-
ed. I’m afraid that scenario was
played out for the last time
around 20 years ago.

Wistfully yours,
Ivan de Bussy
Class of 1901

NOTICE
SENIORS; Please come by the
Calyx office in the University
Center and pick up your in-
formal pictures. Thank you.

We all know how responsible
committee co-chairmen are,
right? And how they’re en-
trusted with thousands of
dollars of student money? And
how many of these guys are in
Who’s Who, ODK and the
Deans’ hip pocket. So get this:
there’s a sign on Contact’s of-
fice door which says, ‘Mr.
Janitor, please do not lock this
door. We have lost our keys.
Thanks, Contact.”’

Steve Abraham was not in-
cluded in an honor trial hearing
Sunday night. Steve was quite
upset about not being invited.
Rumor has it that the case will
be hard again so he can be
there.

A recently graduated ad-
ministration figure reportedly
reportedly had his first date ina
long time Saturday night. No
one is quite sure how the date
went, but we do know who took
care of the kids.

EC officials will soon request
Student Control chairman Jim
MeNider to account for some of
his overzealous investigative
practices. Signing statements
and taped hearings under the
auspices of the honor system
could be a violation of one’s con-
stitutional rights if some of our
law students know what they
are talking about. Many nerve-
wrecked students have likened
the ‘‘knock in the night’’ to the
KGB.

Speaking of “‘knocks in the
night” a certain dorm counselor

Traveler From Altruria

Thought the Traveler had
gone on a sojourn? No, actually
he has been busy compiling a
list of his fearless predictions
for the coming year. Here they
are:

Dean John’s voice will
become so bombastically low,
they’ll ship him off to the North
Sea to become a fog horn.

The Student Activities Board
will change its name to capture
more accurately its essential
contribution to W&L life. It will
be known as the Student’s Ac-
tually Bored.

Parker Potter’s red hat will
be stolen by a very hungry
seagull. He’ll vell and curse at
the bird, saying, ‘‘No, not that.
First my gatefold, then my
vaseline, now my hat.”’

Charlie Hulfish will become
as successful as Bert Lance.

The EC will throw everyone
out of school, declare that

The Nose Knows

who likes to take bus trips down
the road has some interesting
stories to tell. The only problem
is no one believes him.

A junior EC member has been
in the hospital again, or at least
that is what we have been led to
believe. Actually, he disap-
peared from campus so he can
make a grand appearance and
campaign announcement at the
same time. He has his sights on
the presidency. He won’t have
an easy campaign though. The
law school is secretly grooming
its own candidate. Don’t know
officially who it is, but the
money should be on Jackie
Boyden. Matt Calvert, an alum-
nus, is also frequently mention-
ed.

Dum-dum-de-dum. The Math
and Art departments may unite

soon if Fate continues
uninterupted. Enough said. Let
Nature go its way.

Advertising in the Ring-tum
Phi is worthwhile. The news
staffs’ appeal for dates for the
weekend was deemed a hug suc-
cess by the staff. They weren’t
available for comment. They
still hadn’t returned from their
illicit romps. (And they called
Parker Potter’s Ariel “campus
comedy!”’)

ball team have been playing

M.C. plans activities, speakers

by Jim Parker

The Mock Convention may
not have any speakers this
year, but they could very likely
have a distinguished senator as
speaker next year. Senator
Howard Baker of Tennessee,
campaigning for Congressional
re-election, will not speak at
W&L this year, but he promised
the Mock Convention that he
would lecture here in 1979. He is
one of three people contacted as
potential speakers to be spon-
sored by the Mock Convention
this year, according to Jim
MeNider, chairman of the 1980
Mock Convention. McNider said
the two potential speakers
besides Baker are not likely to
speak this year, although the
decision on one is still pending.
If there is a Mock Convention
sponsored lecture this year, it

Bradley — scholar, gentleman

(continued from page 2)

selected Mark as a competitor
for one of the two slots to repre-
sent the state of Virginia in the
competition. Bradley traveled
to Richmond for the first phase
of elimination, and was selected
over 11 other applicants to
represent Virginia. Mark then
traveled to Atlanta for the final
regional competition for the
scholarship. In Atlanta Mark
was subject to the 12 hours of in-
tensive interviews and ques-
tioning.

“The Board even asked me
questions about Lexington and
Washington and Lee. They went
so far as to ask me who a street
was named after, and why,”
said Bradley.

Bradley said he was confident
that he was as prepared as his
competitors for the Rhodes. He
said he knew coming from
Washington and Lee, he would
be on an equal footing in the
competition.

The last W&L man to become
a Rhodes scholar was Ralph H.
Smith, in 1973. The Rhodes
scholarship was first awarded
in 1904, and is named after the
British philanthropist Cecil
Rhodes. Rhodes scholars are
chosen on the basis of scholar-
ship, athletic participation,
character and leadership.

Bradley will study for two
years at Oxford in England on
the scholarship. Mark said his
first choice of college at Oxford
was Corpus Christi. He plans to
study modern history during his
stay.

“You have a tutor you meet
with every week. You both sit
down and design your schedule.
I’m really looking forward to
the independent study program
after having to get up for ‘B’
hour for four years,’’ Bradley
admitted.

Mark said he wouldn’t be stu-
dying the whole time he is in
England. He plans to travel as
much as possible.

“It boils down to about six
months of study and six months
of travel each year,” he said.

will occur most likely in March
or May.

This year the Mock Conven-
tion may fail to bring a speaker
to W&L, but the organization is
promoting some other ac-
tivities. In March, there will be
a research seminar in co-
operation with the research
assistants in the library. The
seminar will acquaint members
of the Mock Convention with
how to conduct political
research. Furthermore, there is
an idea formulating that the
Mock Convention sponsor in-
ternships for its members. Most
likely the internships would be
political in nature, such as

working for a Senator or

Representative, whether na-
tional or state. If this suggestion

is used, the operation of it will
begin during the Spring of 1979.

The culmination of the Mock
Convention’s work occurs, of
course, in 1980, the year of the
presidential elections. Work has
already begun towards 1980, but
Jim MeNider said it is never too
late to join the Mock Conven-
tion, and he is encouraging peo-
ple to enlist as soon as possible.
For anyone interested in work-
ing on the Mock Convention,
contact one of the ad-
ministrative assistants. They
are Craig Cornett, Dick
Schoenfeld, and Sid Simmons.
Efforts by these 2rd other peo-
ple will finally rs--alt in the 1980
Mock Convention, a revealing
prelude to the actual presiden-
tial elections in November.

Bradley says he plans to box »

already started training. He

Bradley said his selection for
the Fulbright scholarship would
not be official until April. He
was selected as one of approx-
imately 150 students to receive
a Fulbright scholarship in Ger-
many.

Bradley said he first learned
about the Fulbright award two
weeks ago. He said the first
thing he did when learning
about it was to write to the
Fulbright board to ask if he
could delay the scholarship un-
til he finished at Oxford. Mark
said that in his letter he asked
the Fulbright board to give his
scholarship to someone else if
they couldn’t delay it.

“I wanted someone else who
wouldn’t be able to have the
Fulbright to have it if I couldn’t.
The Rhodes is the big thing,”
Bradley explained.

Earlier in his life, Bradley
was known around Virginia not
as a scholar, but as a boxer.
Bradley said he had a 65-1
record as a welterweight from
1972 to 1976. Mark got interested
in boxing through a high school
football coach.

Mark said the high point in his
boxing career was knocking out
the champion from Puerto
Rico. His low point came when
he knocked out an opponent in a

now is in connection with
teaching kids how to box at the
Roanoke YMCA.

“Boxing is a good way to get
kids interested in self-respect. I
learned a lot of patience dealing
with the kids, and I learned how
lucky I am by seeing children
from really poor homes,”
Bradley said.

Between graduation and star-
ting at Oxford, Bradley plans to
engage in the romantic old
Anglo-Saxon dream of running
off tosea.

“I’m going to go to Argentina
for a little while, with the Mer-
chant Marines, just for a
change of pace. It will let me do
some reading and I'll come
back refreshed and ready to
roll,” Bradley explained.

years,”’ Ruscio said. ‘“‘We think
it (the essay) is more of a delay-
ing factor than an inhibiting
one.”

The athletic department has
also cut down on its recruiting
this year, cited Ruscio. Athletic
Director Bill McHenry, who
normally does the bulk of the
football recruiting, has devoted
much of his time this year seek-

ing someone to succeed him as
head football coach. Athletic
recruiting has suffered as a
result.

Other factors, such as the new
national standardized financial
aid forms not being available
until Jan. 1 and the decline na-
tionally of college-age students,
also have had some effect,
Ruscio believes.

tion has finally caught-up with
us,’’ he said.

Statistics lend some support
to that statement. Of 194
students accepted to W&L in
1976 who did not attend the
school, 57 percent gave as their
main reason the lack of
coeducation.

The large drop in applications
has put more pressure on the
school’s admissions depart-
ment. This has resulted in
longer and more frequent
recruiting trips outside the
state. Ruscio represented
Washington and Lee at college
night in Chicago and
Philadelphia in November and

Washington and Lee accepts

the decline in applications will
affect the quality of next year’s

“That’s the logical conclu-
sion, that the drop in applica-
tions will result in our being less
selective,” he said.

“But, in fact, the average

scores of this year’s applicants
seem higher than last year’s,”

on the test is the highest one can

W&L Rumors...

Rumors... Rumors

Was W&L ever listed as the
top drinking school in the coun-
try? Yes, according to Bob
Keefe. In the early 1960s W&L
made it on that list of dubious
distinction. Playboy printed the
list, however W&L has not ap-
peared since.

Pee eeereresececceccscseseesoeceeeeeeseses

Ever hear that W&L was
ranked as the seventh best
school in the country by the
New York Times a few years
ago? Well it’s not true.

Accoridng to Bob Keefe,
News Information Director, in
1954 W&L was listed as one of
the best schools in the country.
It was listed In the Chicago
Tribune as the sixth best male
undergraduate school in the
United States. Keefe pointed out
that was when there were quite
a few all-male colleges.

As far as he knows, there has
been no similar list printed

recently, he said.

 

Lots of people seem to think
that the only reason we have a
spring semester is for the
lacrosse players to run around
in their shorts without having
undue academic pressure plac-
ed on their macho shoulders.
But the real reason, according
to Keefe, is that W&L has found
a short term in the middle of the
year to be totally unworthwhile.
Keefe says this is particulary
true for the science depart-
ments.

How could the geology
department tour the coun-
tryside during the winter, he
syas. Also the  archaelogy
department goes on its digs.
Besides, says Keefe, the foreign
language trips to Europe are
made more worthwhile by vir-
tue of the fact they can stay
there for the entire summer

agreed, saying there should be
“strict criterion” as to what
constitutes an honor violation.
He said it should be made as
clear as possible what specific
actions would initiate honor
trial proceedings.

George Griffin and Jim
Underhill made clear their posi-
tion against codification of the
honor system. They said that
honor has to be decided by the
student generation in question
and any attempt to codify it
would hinder changing student
generation perceptions as to
what is honorable.

Griffin and Underhill were
also against suggestions of a
graduated system of honor
penalties. Griffin said he could

chew the fat

not possibly decide whether
plagiarism is worse than steal-
ing, yet that distinction would
have to be made if the honor
system is to include graduated
penalties. Underhill added that
he believes absolute penalties
have a deterrent effect that
graduated penalties would not.

Despite all the afternoon’s
rhetoric, little was accomplish-
ed except a clearing of the air
and the opening up, to a certain
extent, of the lines of com-
munication between
undergraduate and law school
leaders. The law school cannot
adopt its own honor system, ac-
cording to Swope, unless the
Board of Trustees grants it per-
mission to do so.

“University policy has been
to allow as much freedom to the

possible,’’ Dean Murphy said in
explaining why the fourth op-
tion was chosen. He emphasized
that the University is sup-
portive of the fraternity system,
and that under the checklist op-
tion the fraternities ‘“‘will still

“But there must be a good-

tries that keep secrets that are
harmful to the United States’

said, ‘‘Our advanced

tion.”

Colby said in the 1980s and

with not only the Soviet Union
and China, but with many other
superpowers as well, notably
Brazil and Iran.

‘The Soviet Union now pro-
duces more oil and steel than

cluding our own,’ Colby
reiterated. ‘‘Besides,”’ he said,

“great power is becoming
available in small packages--
nuclear, biological, and

chemical. Without our careful
surveilance , these packages
could fall into the hands of a
reckless despot, seeking his

share of the world’s goods.”’ If

this were the case then the
world ‘‘will not be safe for our
democracy,” he said.

“With knowledge we'll be
able to solve upcoming pro-
blems,”’ he said, ‘‘and be able to
defend ourselves against a
threat before it occurs.”

Colby said he thinks the effect
of good intelligence gathering
will help us get problems to the
negotiating table with the
Soviet Union or anyone else, so
we can solve them together.

One example of this is the
SALT I agreement in which the
United States and the Soviet
Unoin agreed not to develop a
nationwide anti-balistic missile
system, Colby said, ‘‘and
neither of us have , at a saving
of $50-100 billion for taxpayers.”

Colby also said CIA abuses in

exagerated and sensationalized
in the press, giving the
American public a confused and
clouded image of the CIA’s pur-
pose.

fraternities,’ Dean Murphy
continued. He noted that last
year a list of maintenance
recommendations were
presented to each fraternity
and that one year later, many of
the Priority I (most important)
items still had not been attend-
ed to.

The exact nature of the
punitive measure for frater-
nities that do not correct
maintenance deficiencies
outlined on the monthly
checklists has still not been
determined.

One suggested method of ad-
ministering the new fraternity
maintenance system is that the
checklists be submitted to the
Judicial Board of the Inter-
fraternity Council. Failures to
comply would be reported to the
IFC for corrective action,
allowing the IFC to administer
the entire program.

The Fraternity Inspection
Committee, which is supposed
to make two official inspections
a year, would then make unan-
nounced spot-checks of selected
fraternities to guarantee com-
pliance with the checklist
recommendations. They will

also make additional recom-
mendations concerning more

major structural problems
(such as plumbing and
heating).

Fraternities caught during
the spot-checks for having
given false information on com-
pleted checklist forms may be
referred directly to either the
Student Control Committee or
che Student Affairs Committee
for punitive action.

In reference to some of the
costly remodeling recommen-

dations made in the fire and
safety report, Dean Murphy
said that the administration
realizes that all fraternity
houses met fire and safety stan-
dards at the time of their con-
struction, although those stan-
dards may have changed since
then. The desire is, however, for
minimum safety standards to
be met and further structural
deterioration be arrested. .

. ‘‘We’re trying to support the
fraternities as much as possi-
ble,’’ Dean Murphy said.

Hulfish resigns

Charlie Hulfish, co-chairman
of the Student Activities Board,
resigned his position as head of
that committee amid a new
wave of controversy surroun-
ding the SAB.

Hulfish’s resignation was of-
ficially announced at Sunday
night’s SAB meeting. He was
not in attendance.

In an interview with the Ring-
tum Phi, Hulfish attributed his
resignation to academic respon-
sibilities and the time commit-
ment of being co-chairman of
the SAB. “I was going to resign
-after Fancy Dress anyway,”’ he
said.

“The SAB wasn’t a good
working atmosphere,’’ Hulfish
also charged. He called the
members “apathetic,” leaving
the two chairmen to do all the
work. “I don’t think it was a
good Activities Board,” Hulfish
continued.

Asked whether the resigna-
tion of Hulfish would have any
effect on Fancy Dress; SAB
chairman Bill Tucker said
“no.”’ This year’s ball has been
very well coordinated, he said.
Tucker did say ‘‘We’ll miss him

as a worker.”
Tucker said Hulfish had no

particular contacts or areas of

experience which will effect the
smooth operation of the SAB
over the rest of the year. He
said he could handle the duties
of sole chairman. ‘‘Anyone can
do it if it’s well-run,” he said.
Tucker added that he will
recommend a single chairman
be appointed next year because
if a committee has a voice of
“final authority’, no one can
pass the buck.

Tucker said he got along with
Hulfish pretty well. ‘‘I was very
curious to see how the year
would go,” he said, ‘Charlie
and I have different per-
sonalities.’’ He stated that there
were no major personality pro-
blems, although “I would get
embarrassed by what he said.”
Tucker did not elaborate.

The Executive Committee
voted unanimously on Monday
not to appoint someone to take
Hulfish’s place on the SAB. Bill
Tucker will act as the chairman
of the SAB until the end of the
term.

Mock Convention seeks

new blood,

by Jim Ingham .

Although the Mock Conven-
tion is still two years away, the
Steering Committee has
already started paying plans
for the nationally known event.
John Trump, co-chairman of
the event, said that an operation
is now taking place to usher in
new committee leadership, and
that contacts are now being
made to the Republican Party
for information pertaining to
the 1980 election.

Trump said that he and the
other co-chairman, Jim
McNider, will both be
graduated by the time the next
Mock Convention rolls around.
He said that their main task for
now is to gradually let go of the
administrative reigns of the
Steering Committee and to let
their assistants take control.
These assistants are Dick
Schoenfeld, Craig Cornett and
Sid Simmons.

Trump said that the Steering
Committee is also in the process
of contacting the Republican
Party Headquarters in hopes of
gaining information on possible
candidates for the 1980
presidential election. Trump
said it would be the work of the
Steering Committee to “keep
track of what the possible can-
didates are doing and to stay in
contact with these candidates
personally.”” Trump said the
Steering Committee is also sen-
ding letters out to possible
donors who might help finance

leadership

the convention.

Trump said that there were a
number of steps being taken to
insure that the handling of
finances will be better in the
1980 convention than they were
in the 1976 convention. ‘The
new Harris Computer system
will be used to insure more ac-
curacy in accounting pro-

Fraternity checklist
after break

The Fraternity Inspection
Committee will go around to all
fraternities after mid-winter
break with a checklist of high
priority items required for
every residence, it was an-
nounced at the Interfraternity
Council meeting on Tuesday.

The checklists will include:
the availability of fire ex-
tinguishers and access to other
fire-fighting equipment; the
maintenance of fire doors; in-
stallation of smoke dectectors;
accessibility to fire escapes;
evidence of debris and
dangerous materials; posting of
emergency signs and fire exits;
and the overall outside ap-
pearance of the houses.

Failure to comply with the
maintenance requests will
result in punitive action. The
Fraternity Inspection Commit-

tee will also make unannounced
-spot-checks of selected frater-

nities to guarantee compliance
with the checklist recommenda-
tions.

In other actions discussed at
Tuesday’s IFC meeting:

—Phi Delta Theta and Sigma
Nu were placed on conduct pro-
bation for one week.

—It was announced that the
University will pay all royalty
costs required by the new
copyright laws up to $1,000 for
each fraternity.

—A food seminar involving
the formation of a _ food
cooperative and_ kitchen
management will be conducted
by Jerry Darrell after mid-
winter break.

—Chris Volk was voted editor
of next year’s Rush’ Book.

Despite the steeped traditions
which have mingled with the
regal columns of Washington

now to make it the classical
Southern University, W&L has

Lee’s establishment in 1969 of 50
“press scholarships’’ seems
remarkable indeed. His idea
was to give prospective jour-
nalists free tuition in the
classics plus one hour of on-the-
job training each day.

The one and only jounalism
professor at the time, William
Johnson, explained Lee’s idea

Washington and Lee ‘firsts’

by saying, ‘We do not hope to
make men fit for the editorial
chair at once, but we do hope to
give them as good an education
as possible that they may make
more cultivated editors.”

Apparently, Lee’s offer found
few, if any, takers. Lee died in
1870. The idea of a journalism
school lived long after, even
though W&L had to drop the
idea of journalism scholarships
in 1878 because of the lack of in-
terest. In 1921 journalism
returned to W&L and situated
itself in Reid Hall, where it now
remains.

With the return of a jour-
nalism schocl to W&L and with
the flourishing of other jour-
nalism schools, Robert E. Lee’s
dream truly proved to be ahead
of its time. Editorialists called
it an ‘‘absurdity”’ when Lee first
proposed it but, as with many

Fencing club
receives $1200
from E.C.

by Randy Smith

Washington and Lee’s year-
old Fencing Club was given
$1,200 at Monday’s Executive
Committee meeting.

Dr. James Worth, university
psychologist and coach of the
Fencing Club, had originally
asked the EC for $2,000 to buy
uniforms and equipment for the
group.

Although fencing has receiv-
ed little recognition as a sport
here, Dr. Worth said that
W&L’s “‘young’”’ fencing team
is dedicated and “‘not just a fly-
by-night outfit.”’ The current
team was started by him in
January, 1977.

“I think it’s very valuable for
W&L to have a fencing team; I
think it’s a great sport,’ Dr.
Worth explained. “Fencing of-
fers a guy a chance to compete
without prior experience.”’

He estimated the cost of out-
fitting a nine man team at $125
per man. Members of the Fenc-
ing Club are currently fencing
with their own equipment. The
$2,000 figure also included
“about $800’’ for electrical scor-
ing equipment used in matches.

Doug Perkins, senior EC
representative, said, ‘$2,000 is
a large chunk of money to
benefit such a small group. The
money should come from the
athletic department.”

Dr. Worth explained that he
had gone to the athletic depart-
ment last spring with a request
for funds and had been told by
Director William McHenry that
he would receive no money. Dr.
Worth added that he was trying
the “bandwagon approach,” in
the hope that support from the

Louisville editor
on. Press Ethics

by Randy Smith
“There is not much doubt in
my mind that the organs of the
press are not believed by the

public’”’ said Robert C. Clark,
executive editor of the
Louisville Courier-Journal

andTimes, in a speech given in
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s Lee Chapel Monday night.

Clark’s lecture, entitled ‘‘Our
Beleagured Press: Our Ethics
On Trial,” focused on the lack
of credibility currentlv suffered
by the print media in the United
States.

“Since 1961, television has led
newspapers in credibility,”
Clark stated. He cited many
public opinion polls and surveys
documenting the ‘‘disillusion-
ment’? and “lack of public
respect for newspapers.”

To correct what Washington
Post ombudsman Charles Seib
calls ‘‘the pervasive distrust of
the media,” Clark stressed that
“print journalism must become
more responsible’ to the
American public. This end
could be accomplished through
“greater balance’’ and “‘higher
news judgments,” he said.

Clark explained that for
many newspapers, the editorial
policy ‘‘often sets the tone’’ for
the news section. The public can
perceive this bias’ he continued,
so there is a great need to make
distinct the separation of news
reporting and the editorial posi-
tion of a newspaper.

The ‘‘widespread’’ and “‘in-
discriminate use of the unnam-
ed source’’ was also suggested
by Clark as a reason for the
public’s ‘‘distrust’’ of
newspapers. Unless there is a
“clear need’’ to keep a source
confidential — such as possible
physical harm — he should be
named, Clark said. ‘Poltiical

axes can be ground with un- .

named sources.”’

‘“‘A liason between the press
and the Central Intelligence
Agency can only harm the

credibility of the press,’’ Clark
stated. ‘‘We cannot pose as
others or let others pose as the
press,’’ he emphasized. ‘“‘Is the
integrity of the press to be
subverted to whatever the spy
trade wants?”’

“It is not only conflicts (of in-
terest), but the potential for
conflicts (of interest) which
must be guarded against,’
Clark said. He outlined the
ownership of stocks and bonds
by business writers and the ac-
ceptance of free trips and gifts
as possible conflicts of interest
which had contributed to the
undermining of newspaper
credibility.

To remedy the  public’s
wariness of newspaper content,
Clark suggested that journalists
subscribe to one of the various
codes of ethics stressing respon-
sibility, accuracy, and im-
partiality.

He also recommended that
newspapers accept criticism
better by printing corrections in
a prominent place and by hiring
an ombudsman (an “‘inhouse”’
critic who analyses. the
newspaper's performance on a
day-to-day basis).

‘‘We must have ever higher
standards,” Clark concluded.
“To uphold the First Amend-
ment we must have public ser-
vice and public trust.”

A dog’s life in Rockbridge

“I pick up between 450 to 500
dogs a year,” said G. Berns
Conner, dog warden for
Rockbridge County. ‘‘And not
more than 10 or 12 of them ever
are claimed.”

“T answered 731 complaints
last year, and that is more than
I can handle,” he said. ‘Yet
people get-on me anyways for
picking up their dogs.”’

The county has had a serious
dog problem ever since he
became dog warden 12 years
ago, Conner said. Each year,
dogs -destroy livestock, spread
diseases, bite people and cause
expensive property damage.

And it is not the dogs’ fault,
Conner stressed.

The fault lies with county
residents and college students
who own dogs and forget that it
is their responsibility to care for
the animals, Conner said.

“Students sometimes leave
for the holidays and leave their
dogs behind,” he said. ‘“They
leave the animals outside with
nothing but an opened bag of

dog food and expect them to
survive.”

What happens, however, is
that the dogs die of thirst or
from cold weather or make
nuisances of themselves by kill-
ing livestock and damaging
farm crops, Conner said.

Often, Conner winds up pick-
ing up the dogs.

The dogs Conner picks up are
brought to the county pound,

to Conner. :

Conner said he frequently
receives complaints from coun-
ty farmers that dogs kill
livestock and destroy crops.
The county recorded the deaths
of 70 sheep and one cow in 1977
were caused by stray dogs.

Conner, however, said he
does not have enough time to in-
vestigate every complaint. He
is the only dog catcher in the

Young Democrats
support ERA

At a recent meeting of the
Washington and Lee University
Young Democrats the club
adopted a resolution in support
of the proposed Equal Rights
Amendment. In taking this ac-
tion, the Young Democrats, for
the first time since the
organization was founded two
years ago, announced its of-
ficial position concerning a con-
troversial legislative issue. The
resolution to actively support
the Equal Rights Amendment
was written and moved by the
club’s Political Affairs Commit-
tee and was acepted by the club
in a nearly unanimous vote. The
Equal Rights Amendment will
probably be the most divisive
issue considered by the General
Assembly this legislative ses-
sion.

to look into a matter, people

shot by farmers last year, ac-
cording to Conner.

The only answer to dog the
problem, according to Conner,
is that county residents and col-
lege students who own dogs
must accept a sense of respon-
sibility and take better care of
their pets.

Especially during school

Jackie Boyden, law school

In other action by the EC:

—It was announced that
Charlie Hulfish, co-chairman of

ad hoc member of the SAB, said
that it was the wish of the SAB
to have only one chairman.
Jack Bovay, junior represen-
tative, motioned that no other
chairman be appointed in
Hulfish’s place. Motion passed
unanimously.

—Jim Underhill, president of
the EC, said that the chairman
of the Student Control Commit-
tee, Jim McNider, would ap-
pear before the EC on Feb. 20.
Underhill explained that all EC
members would receive copies
of the SCC statement of pro-
cedures to ‘‘become familiar

said there were possible con-

UT succeeds with O’Neill

A RING-TUM PHI COMMENTARY

by Parker Potter

‘“‘There’s gold in the West.”’
There’s gold in the Troubadour
Theatre too. Eugene O’Neill’s
Desire Under the Elms is a rich
vein, well mined. This senior
thesis production directed by
Chris Willett must be com-
mended for its deft handling, a
difficult assignment.

In a play such as this the
characters are ‘‘pure_ in-
dividuals, capable of choice and
responsibility,’ the major pro-
blem for both the writer and the
director is in holding the play
together. A state full of isolated
individuals such as we have
here could easily become a
state full of isolated
monologues. But such is not the
case.

To each character, the farm
is something different, yet it is
powerfully important. To
Ephraim, the father, it is
Ephraim; to Abbie it is a

coveted home; and to Eben it is
the memory of his mother.
These disparate symbolications
of the farm are brought
together, though, in the well-
meshed levels of intensity
\within which each of the three
pursues his own good.

An even more difficult con-
cept in the play to grasp, yet one
which is exceedingly well
handled, is the various por-
trayals of the characters.
Eben’s mother, the last wife of

“old Ephraim Cabot, is dead

when the curtain rises. Yet her
presence is almost constant
throughout the play. Eben sees
both himself and the farm as ex-
tensions of her; Abbie sees her
as the key to unlocking Eben’s
heart; while Ephraim cannot
rid himself of her memory when
he sees her living image in
Eben.

All this serves to illustrate the
principal difficulty with the

play. Each character has a
completely different conception
of the world. They clearly see
the same things, but such wide-
ly different interpretations are
attached to these personal ob-
jects that there is no common
ground. Each character has
“valued” his way to isolation.
Yet they are all here together in
‘one play and ‘must co-exist
together in the world of the
Cabot farm.

It is this tangled cacophony of
values, so well handled, that
makes the last scene work so
well. Abbie, to prove her love
for Eben, has killed thier own
baby, and they are about to be
taken off to prison. In tragedy,
the result of misunderstanding,
an understanding family unit
suddenly emerges. In Abbie and
Eben, there are two characters
loving each other with no str-
ings attached. But enough
theoretical discussions — on to
the performers in this play
itself.

David Chester as Eben was
given one of the most difficult
assignments of the season in
this role. Eben embodies a
curious duality which is quite
hard to portray. On the one
hand, he is not overly bright.
(Anyone who has played a
stupid person knows just how
hard that is; the line between
sounding like a stupid character
and sounding like a stupid actor
is fine indeed.) On the other
hand, he is possessed, driven by
the association of his mother
with the farm. The complexity
arises when one realizes that,
even though many slow-witted
people can be very persistant in
following something, rarely is it

Chamber Players, includes
Leon Fleisher as conductor;
Dina Koston, pignist; Pina Car-
mirelli, violinist; and Phyllis
Bryn-Julson, soprano. The
ensemble also includes a
mezzo-soprano, baritone, and
performers of the following in-
struments: flute, French horn,
violin, viola, cello, contrabass,
guitar, harpsichord, celesta,
and multiple percussion.

Washington’s Theater
Chamber Players was founded
in 1968 by Leon Fleisher and
Dina Koston and gave its first
concerts during the 1968-69
season at the Washington
Theater Club. It is a non-profit
organization whose purpose is
to present outstanding contem-
porary music and music of the
past in performances of excep-
tionally high quality by artists
of the highest calibre. The
ensemble draws on music of
many periods, relating new
music to its particular
antecedents.

The Theater Chamber
Players present annually in
Washington a series of five
chamber music programs
which have made a unique con-

Therefore, in reaction to my

counterpoint (Christ, I feel like
Shana Alexander), I present
this first review for your enter-

tribution to the city’s musical
life. In 1973 the Players found a
new home at the Smithsonian
Institution, performing in the
Baird Auditorium of the
Museum of Natural History
under the auspices of the Divi-
sion of Performing Arts. At the
end of that season (1973-74), the
group was asked by the
Smithsonian to become a
‘‘chamber ensemble in
residence,’ an honor never
before accorded any — or
ensemble.

The Board of Trustees of the
John F. Kennedy Center recent-
ly named the Theater Chamber

chamber music hall, which is
scheduled to be completed in
early 1979. They will make their
New York debut this month at
the 92nd Street Young Men’s

vitation of Alan Marks and
Omus Hirshbein.

The Theater Chamber

same as their New York City

“The Vinyl Junkie”

There must have been
something wrong with my copy
of this album (albumen). It
didn’t sound right. I thought for
a minute that it was my turn-
table’s fault, but the remainder
of my album collection sounds
fine.

So, in a fit of frustration
(y’see, I’ve tried for years to be
a scholar of serious rock com-
position and performance), I
threw the damned ELP disc
across the room. It flew
beautifully! So I took it out in
the front yard and discovered
that it made an_ excellent
plaything, and have enjoyed the
album ever since. True to the ti-
tle, it ‘‘works,”’ but only as a
frisbee.

As soon as a significant sampling of the student

quotable? Very doubtful; most women are not

body votes in favor of having women share their
everyday lives as well as their hectic social hours,
along comes Valentine’s Day to put the spotlight
back on romance. Ever since poor old Adam in the
Garden of Eden discovered the joys — and sorrows
— of knowledge (carnal?), humanity has tried to
express in language the delights and torments of
love — what Plato called ‘‘that grave mental
disease.”’

In an hour or so of browsing through some dic-
tionaries of quotations one can discover the wide
gamut of elations and agonies caused by the willful
god of love. Love can be a ‘‘sweeping of the heart.”’
Says one writer; another says ‘‘the pest of love gives
the most unrest.” Sir Walter Scott sings that ‘‘love
is heaven and heaven is love.”’ In it ‘‘the sweetest
joy and the wildest woe,”’ according to Bailey. And
the playwright, Philip Barry, claims that ‘“‘love is
two minds without a single thought.”

The collections contain very few quotes from
women. Did they feel too deeply to become

given to silent passions. However, the men quoted
hold forth about women — mostly in tormented
tones. Oscar Wilde, that quotation editor’s delight —
says that ‘“‘men all want to be a woman’s first love
— women like to be man’s last romance.”

King Edward the VIII of England gave up a
throne for the ‘‘woman I love” but Nicholas Murray
Butler said “It is better to have loved and lost then
never to have lost at all.’”’ A psychologist calls love
merely ‘‘a conflict between reflexes and reflec-
tions.”’ Martin Luther is attributed with the remark
that ‘“‘He who loves not wine, woman and song re-
mains a fool his whole life long.’’ A woman, Helen
Rowland, is quoted as saying ‘love is a woman’s
eternal spring and a man’s eternal fall’’...Back to
Adam and Eve we go.

One last selection, which delights this bookseller’s
heart: ‘‘After love, book collecting is the most ex-
hilarating sport of all.’’ An exact quote, so help me!

Wrestlers put lock
on ODAC title

by Mark Peterson

The wrestling Generals com-
pleted a second consecutive
undefeated season in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
Tuesday evening by defeating
league rival Hampton-Sydney
45-3. The victory, which raised
the team’s overall record to 5-3
rounded out a demanding week
of wrestling which included a
28-15 setback to powerful Liber-
ty Baptist and an impressive
showing in the Pembrook In-
vitational on Saturday.

In drubbing Hampton-Sydney
the Generals firmly established
themselves as the overwhelm-
ing favorite in the upcoming
Conference tournament. The
team was led by Mike Deighan
(142), Jim Flippen (158), and
Ollie Mowry (HVW) all of
whom registered pins.
Freshman Ed Kramer (118),
returning to action for the first
time since a December knee in-
jury, also gave an impressive
showing in winning 25-0. Other
victors included Ray Gross
(150), Tom Oxendine (177) and
tri-captain Ed Rodgers (167). In
addition, tri-captains Howdy
Knipp (126) and Dan Kniffen
(190) received forfeit victories.

The Pembrook Invitational,

held last Saturday, was one of
the most successful of the year
for theGenerals with five men
placing. Dan Kniffen earned se-
cond place honors, Ed Rodgers
took third and Ray Gross, Ollie
Mowry and Howdy Knipp
brought home fourth place
hardware, with the latter clear-
ly giving the team’s most im-
pressive performance. Though
no team standings were record-
ed, the Generals certainly
would have placed had there
been.

Even in the loss to Liberty
Baptist several bright signs
were evident. The team’s up-
perweight class put on its best
showing of the year with Dan
Kniffen pinning his oppenent
and Tom Oxendine and Ollie
Mowry also winning. In addi-
tion, Howdy Knipp continued
his outstanding wrestling with a
victory.

With classes in recess, the
team picks up its pace this week
with a total of eight meets dur-
ing the vacation period. It all
begins with a home match on
Friday against Davidson Col-
lege and concludes in Boston
with meets against such promi-
nent schools as Lowell Tech,
MIT, and Harvard.

Generals crush
Eastern Mennonite

by Mark Mitchell
Washington and Lee’s basket-
ball team continued their
brilliant string of offensive per-

formances with a 103-75 win ©

over Eastern Mennonite last
Thursday night.

In front of a small crowd at
Doremus Gymnasium, the
young Royals started the game
by shooting extremely well. In
fact, their outside shooting gave
them the lead most of the first
half.

While the Royals, were
shooting from twenty feet, the
Generals stayed close by work-
ing the ball inside for easy
shots. W&L also showed great
determination under the offen-
sive boards, sometimes getting
five successive offensive re-
bounds before scoring.

Despite the Generals ex-
cellent offensive execution; the
Royals were ahead by four with
six minutes to go in the half.
The Royals point guard was too
quick to cover, it seemed. But
Wenke, master of drawing the
charge, drew a couple of offen-
sive fouls, sending the Royals’
point guard to the bench.
Without their star guard,

Eastern Mennonite could not
handle the Generals’ pressure.
As a result, W&L led 40-34 at
the half.

In the second half, Wenke
continued to draw offensive
fouls, fouling the starting point
guard out of the game. Then,
Dennis went on a scoring ram-
page.

The Royals reacted by apply-
ing full-court pressure with
ag. 15 minutes to go,
desperately trying to get back
into the ballgame. Wenke threw
a long pass to Collins in an att-
mept to foil the zone press. Col-
lins, seeing that he had a 2-on-1
situation, drove to the hoop, and
dunked it over a_ stunned
defender.

After Collins had thus signall-
ed that the game was over, Den-
nis worked free underneath
several times to give the
Generals a 59-40 lead.

A few minutes later, the
Generals applied full-court
pressure. The pressure so
devastated the Royals, that
with 10 minutes remaining,
W&L led by 75-50, and the only
question was whether the
Generals would go on to score
100 points.

   

Cagers defeat Shenandoah
for sixth straight win

by Ken Mastrelli

Larry Meyers and Dave
Leunig both scored 17 points
each here Monday night to help
W&L win its sixth straight
basketball game, 99-88, over the
clumsy but high-scoring
Hornets from Shenandoah.

Despite vying with Shenan-
doah’s Tom Marple for the
game’s high-scoring honors at
29 points, Pat Dennis had a bad

night from the floor. But, with.
Myers muscling his man on the

inside and Dave Leunig’s 20-
footers from the outside, the
Generals managed to keep pace
with the hot shooting Hornets
throughout the first half, which
ended tied at 44.

The first half was filled with
fouls, putting both teams in the
one-and-one situation early in
the second quarter. The
Hornets managed to cash in on
a number of three-point plays in
that first half which saw both
teams turn the ball over time

and again on bad passes and of-
fensive fouls.

Maybe it was the cold gym,
but the pace of the game seem-
ed rather sluggish, although the
close score throughout the con-
test kept the meager audience
of 150 shivering partisans glued
to their seats.

The cold weather did not stop
Larry Meyer, however. The
sophomore forward is looking
better each game and may be
the Generals’ most consistent
player beside Dennis. Meyer
had three crucial steals, all
within a time-span of five
minutes.

At the other forward spot
Junior Dave Leunig had eight
rebounds and hustled all night
long on the Generals’ man-to-
man full-court press.

Canfield must be happy that
his center position is looking
strong , as Ardith Collins and
Bob Smitherman combined for
18 points. Beside contributing 10
points at center, Smitherman
also biocked three shots. The
Generals did get some help mid-
way through the second-half
which they normally can’t ex-
pect. It came in the form of
those men with the zebra-
striped shirts who run up and
down the court with whistles in
their mouths.

With the score 66-64, and
Sheanandoah still very much in
the game, Hornets’ coach Jim
Edmondson was slapped with
his second technical foul of the
night. Meyers, who had just
been fouled, hit three of four
shots as Edmondson fumed and
fretted on the bench. You could
see the steam rising off him
from the press box. Honest.

Another hot Hornet was
William Hill. His heroics kept
Shenandoah close for the most
of the game and the Generals
were only able to pull away
when he had to sit down because
of foul trouble in the second
half.

For Fallon, enthusiasm is the
key to W&L’S football success

by Jim Barnes

Gary Fallon, the new head
football coach, approached the
young man with a_ heavily
notated copy of the football
team roster out of one of last
year’s programs. He surveyed
the six foot two-and-a-half inch
featherweight and: asked, “I
don’t remember your name .
Where are you on this roster?”’
The young man replied, ‘‘I‘m
not a football player, sir. I just
want to ask you a few questions
for the Ring-tum-Phi, the stu-
dent newspaper.

One thing’s for sure, Fallon is
going to exhaust all the
possibilities, and even some
unimaginable ones as evidenc-
ed by the above exchange, in
order to mold the Generals into
a winner on the gridiron.

So what is the basic formula
this inspiring new coach brings
to W&L? Fallon says, ‘I want
to communicate the feeling I
have in me to my staff and to
the individual players. I’m a

very enthusiastic and intense
guy. The kids have a great
hunger to be motivated. If I can
transmit my enthusiasm for the
game to them, the winning will
come.”’

Although Saturday’s program
may judge the Generals to be
less than the equal of some of
their opponents based on
physical data and past record,
Fallon believes that he can
breach these gaps with en-
thusiasm. “It’s gotta help,”
gushes the new coach, “I’ve got
to hope that we’ll be capable of
competing against all of our op-
ponents. You can build up con-
fidence in a guy to the point
where he’ll say. ‘I’m going to
win.’ After that point,” repeats
Fallon, ‘“‘the winning will
come.”

After getting each player to
realize his potential, Fallon
hopes to channel each in-
dividual’s drive into a team ef-
fort. Fallon says, ‘“‘They’ve got

to be thinking all the time. Each
kid has got to be disciplined in
doing his job. They’ve got to
have confidence in their team-
mates’ ability to do the job.”

Another key element of a win-
ning football program, said
Fallon, is the nature in which
practice was conducted in the
week proir to gametime. “I
want them to want to come to
practice,” he said. Fallon add-
ed that “the competitive spirit
should reach a peak on Satur-
day. If you can’t get yourself
up, that’s a cop-out. He also
said, ‘“You can win close games
if you’re mentally prepared.”

Since Fallon was nammed
head football coach in January,
ment is giving the football ap-
plications vis-a-vis the
February 15 deadline. “They
seem sympathetic to football’s
needs. That doesn’t mean that
standards will be lowered,”

The making of the movie
Saturday Night Fever, and its
immense success, suggest that
unexpected ideas have got a
hold on the popular imagina-
tion. I am speaking of the ideas
which have crystallized in what
we conveniently call The
Women’s Movement, and which
the film implies have filtered
down from the professional,
highly educated, “‘liberal,’’ or
otherwise privileged levels of
society, which gave them birth,
to portions of society ‘which
have for a long time seemed
unalterably hostile to them. The
values which seem to have
filtered down include the belief
that men and women can be
friends, on equal terms; the
belief that men can need
women, rather than merely
needing to master them; and
the belief that this need does not
demean men, does not somehow
make them less than “men.”’
The sexuality and the sex talk
depicted in the film are of a kind
probably intended to shock
large nembers of its audience,
and possibly they do so. That
the film also endorses many of
the values of those in the au-
dience it sets out to offend
makes it controversial on two
fronts. This double thrust is ac-
complished most notably
through the movie’s governing
metaphor— the dance.

Like Saturday Night Fever,
the widely popular recent
movies Rocky and Mean Streets
also show working class- and
street ethics to be in a state of
slow transition. In Rocky, the
hero turns away from the
classic male satisfactions of
hanging around with the
“gang” (the word is given a
more literal significance in the
other two films); he turns in-
stead toward a complex rela-
tionship with a woman as he
becomes that paradox for many
Americans, a sensitive he-man.
And the hero ofMean Streets

has finally to recognize in his

desire for a woman an impulse
more formidable than the need
for a sexual receptacle. In
Saturday Night Fever, recogni-
tions of this kind are more ex-
plicit and more central; they
are located in the fabulously ex-
citing dancing which is the
film’s major distinction. Danc-
ing becomes a metaphor for the
awareness that relations bet-
ween men and women might be
based on mutuality, rather than
on mastery and surrender, or
on superiority and inferiority.

Tony has to woo Stefanie into
dancing with him by showing an
incipient willingness to
acknowledge the (admittedly
sometimes perverse) _ re-
quirements of her being. And in
the important scene in the
dance studio in which, having
made this acknowledgement in
a minimal way, Tony begins to
teach Stefanie the steps he
wants incorporated into their
dance contest routine, he also
allows her to teach him a new
combination of steps. That is,
he consents, for a moment, to
follow her lead. They compose
the dance together.

Now when we look in any
detail at the
theme of this movie, there’s no
doubt that we run into con-
tradictions. For instance,
Tony’s first partner seems to be
a better dancer than Stefanie,
or seems, at least, to dance bet-
ter with Tony (his first dance
with her is more exciting than
his competition number with
Stefanie at the end) — and yet,
she cannot be the heroine of the
film. For one thing, she doesn’t
look like a heroine. The movie is
still sufficiently moored in con-
ventional ideas about female
sexual appeal to make it in-
evitable that its heroine be tall
and skinny, as Stefanie is.
Another reason that the first
woman is rejected as heroine is
that she isn’t ‘hard to get” — as
she tells Tony outside the dance
studio, all she has ever done to
deserve his rejection is liked
him and tried to b his friend.
Finally, it is apparently her sur-
render to several men one after
another on the back seat of a
communal car which seals her
status; the ethics of the film
still seem locked, in this
respect, in the double standard,
with its permissions to men and
its refusals to women.

Yet I doubt that the confu-
sions which surround the
presentation of this character
destroy the importance of the
new ground which is broken
elsewhere in the film. The
seriousness with which it is
prepared to treat the theme of
friendship between the sexes is
attested first by the last scene,
in which Tony asks to be friends
with Stefanie, though, touching-
ly, he’s still, even then, not sure

this is what he wants or will be
able to accept from her. The
film’s seriousness in this regard
is attested even more by its will-
ingness to let this be the last

some. At this point, the
film frustrates our expectations
in an interesting way— for we
had expected to see Tony in bed
with Stefanie some time before
the end. It is to the film’s credit
that it does not force-bloom
their affair for the sake of
romantic expectation. By not
incorporating a consummation
scene, the film asks us to accept
the premise that the new kind of
relationship toward which it
points has really not yet been
fully imagined. Neither Tony
nor Stefanie know precisely
what such a relationship would
be like, nor, it must be said, do
most of us, it is so new. The film
has the courage to content itself
with showing how difficult it is
simply to change gears.

In its yearning to forge a kind
of relationship which is foreign
to the world which Tony and
Stefanie come, the film seems
to turn its back on what it
makes Brooklyn mean. And yet,
the emphasis given to dancing
ultimately creates an ideal
which is not only impossible to
sustain in the Brooklyn sub-
culture, but which is almost
equally inimical to that part of
the Manhattan world which the
film chooses to show. Neither
Brooklyn nor Manhattan
represents a world with which
this film is happy. Instead’ it
uses dancing as a way of
“bridging” over into a world
that it wants to exist. (It is not
surprising that the bridge bet-
ween Brooklyn and Manhattan
plays so large a part in the plot
and the landscape of the
movie.) The world that the film
wants to bring into being is a
world in which the raw sexual
energy which makes Saturday
nights in Brooklyn ‘“‘feverish’’
can coexist with the more sen-
sitive and refined, but common-
ly de-sexualized world of
Manhattan’s cultured and
pseudo-cultured. We note that
when Stefanie wants to dance,
she goes back to Brooklyn. We
may legitimately question the
accuracy of this picture of
Manhattan, and the way in
which the the film sets up its

symbols, but it would be im-
poverishing to question the im-
portance of what this film seeks
to accomplish. It seeks to find a
way to bridge the old Freudian
antagonism between sexuality
and “culture,’’ to construct a

new kind of relationship bet-
ween men and women whose
radicalism might make it at
least possible to unite these
customarily splintered aspira-
tions of our lives.

Foot Loose & Fancy Free
Rod Stewart
(Warner Bros. BSK-3092)

Gee, that Rod Stewart sure
must be one wild and crazy guy.
I can just see him hoofing down
the high road to adventure,
singing those wonderfully gay
songs with as much west coast
mediocrity as he can muster.
And believe me, Bub, this
album when compared to some
of Rod’s old stuff brings new
definition to the non-sequitor
“mediocre.” What can I say?
Rod is the archetypical story of
rock ‘n’ roll gone to Hollywood.
The west coast has a sedating
effect on rock, it pulls the rough
edge out of the music and pours
the slick production and session
men in. The result is invariably
somehow to professional and
commercial, and _ therefore,
somwhat geriatric in a rock
sense.

One major problem with
Rod’s recent effort is that his
band is just too clean. Sure, the
present line-up is far superior in
technique to Stewart’s last
group, The Faces, but they lack
that lovable ineptness and
English-school-boy charm
which more than makde up for
The Faces’ lack of virtuosity.

However, there are some de-
cent tunes on Foot Loose &
Fancy Free. “Hot Legs’ and
“Born Loose” (which I am
listening to at this moment) are

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

‘Lillies that fester smell
far worse than weeds’

It is all very amusing when the SAB or Contact is criticized con-
tinually for mishandling student funds, but it becomes a very
serious matter when an organization begins to mishandle students’
rights. The way in which Student Control conducts its investiga-
tions and hearings very well may encroach upon the rights of
students.

At least one case has arisen this year involving a signed confes-
sion for a university infraction which also was a felony in the State
of Virginia. A student was compelled to sign a confession admitting
to (a) smoking marijuana, and (b) smoking marijuana in the
dorms. Such a document could be quite valuable to local police in
establishing probable cause to arrest the student for the offense.

SCC chairman Jim MeNider, acting for the committee, has tried
on at least one occasion to tape a Student Control hearing. The par-
ticular students involved in the SCC case were also involved in a
criminal case for the same offense. Their case had not yet come to
trial. The tapes, if the hearing had been recorded, possibly could
have been used in some way against them.

When a student comes in front of the E.C. for an honor violation,
he is afforded the right to confront his accusers. Not so in an SCC
hearing: at least it has not been the practice to allow the accused to
even see his accuser, must less prepare a defense.

And of course all SCC hearings are private and secret, unlike the
real world in which court cases are public.

McNider maintains the committee is only following the letter of
its constitution. The committee is efficient in doing so. This is the
basis of the whole problem. The committee, or the chairman acting
for the committee, has become efficient, but through the use of
measures that are not covered in the constitution. Nowhere in the
SCC constitution does it say written confessions are to be secured.
Nowhere does it say the hearings are to be recorded. Nowhere does
it say the accused cannot face his accuser, and nowhere does it say
that the results of the proceedings are to be kept secret. But it also
must be mentioned that neither does the constitution say the com-
mittee cannot use written confessions or tape recordings or that it
should make the results of the proceedings public. Nowhere is it
written that the accused should be allowed to prepare a defense.
Maybe it should be. It seems our basic rights can no longer be
assumed.

In its attempt to do a good job, the SCC has become over zealous
in the way it goes about doing it. The SCC should be congratulated
for being efficient and doing all it can to find out everything about a
case. Just pray you never have to appear before Student Control.

If you do, you will meet the chairman. The chairman will conduct
the whole investigation himself. The constitution says he can. He
will prepare the case against you. The constitution says he can.
Then, if he is feeling really energetic, he may even decide on his
own whether or not the SCC should even hear your case or if it
should go to the E.C. The constitution says a majority of the SCC
must decide to hear the case. If the accused suspects he has not
received fair treatment, he can appeal the SCC penalty to the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee. There he will confront the SCC chairman
again. This time the chairman has a vote. Perhaps the chairman’s
position assumes too many responsibilities.

The SCC constitution needs to be rewritten so as to afford the
Washington and Lee student his basic rights. It should be specified
how the SCC should regard possible criminal infractions. It should
particularize what rights the accused has. The White Book does
this. Finally, since the SCC deals with cases that are not honor of-
fenses, the results, excluding names of defendants, should be made
a matter of public record. Not only would this inform the W&L
community of SCC treatment of certain offenses, but it would also
open the SCC to constructive criticism from the public whom it is
supposed to be serving.

the fifty-six percent should be

look they all knew what they
were getting into when they ap-
plied and if they don’t like it
now they can go somewhere
else after all single-sex is the
only thing to consider when
choosing a college no one wor-
ries about trivia like academic

quality location size or cost

those things couldn’t have in-
fluenced anyone to come here
they all decided on the basis of
whether there were girls or not
besides as we all know
washington and lee men have
little trouble finding dates a
number of women’s, colleges
are nearby in a variety of social
and other activities are spon-
sored in conjunction with these
women’s colleges see it says so
right in the catalogue it must be
true as my neighbor told me
just the other day if we started
accepting women frats might
suffer and we sure wouldn't
want that would we what would
this school be without the frats
and as another friend told me a
week ago if we let women in
they would all be smart ugly
girls and we’d have to go down
the road anyway because
everyone knows there’s no such
thing as an intelligent girl who’s
good-looking too and _ what
would happen to my buddies
who are down in the bottom of
their class rankings why they
might get bumped out by the
competition what are those
freaks trying to do to this in-
Stitution it sounds like the
school’s turned fifty-six percent
communist all they want is
change for the sake of change
like the rest of society these
days they don’t have the

McNider responds

Dear Editor:

In response to your vaguely
accusatory and_ grossly
misleading article of February
2, the Student Control Commit-
tee would like to unequivocably
assert that we have precisely
followed those procedures
detailed in our ‘Statement of
Purposes and Procedures.”

Regarding our position as to
Student Control cases which in-
volve possible honor violations,
the Committee will continue to

allow the EC to exercise its
jurisdiction these matters.

In the future, if there is any
question about our procedural
fidelity, I suggest that you come
directly to the Committee in-
stead of irresponsibly relying
on “sources” which have no
connection whatsoever with our
organization.

Respectfully,

Jim McNider

Chairman,

Correction

The quote from a faculty
member on the Admissions
Committee in last week’s
editorial saying there has been
a 56 percent drop in the number
of applications was erroneous.
The faculty member actually
said the number of applications
are 56 percent of last year,
meaning applications have
dropped 44 percent.

innovative ideas, only time
could prove him right.

ODK was a second great
W&L innovation. It was found-
ed on December 3, 1914. The
idea originated with two college
roommates: J. Carl Fisher and
Ruppert N. Latture. Their idea,
expanded and matured with the
aid of the inspirational tradi-
tions and idealism of Robert E.
Lee and George Washington,
was to bring together leaders in
all phases of University life.
Rather than remaining
ensconced in the stagnate rela-
tionships typical of students and
professors, ODK wanted to br-
ing outstanding students and in-
Structors together in an at-
mosphere based on common in-
terest, understanding and
helpfulness.

An official publication of ODK
at the time said, ‘ODK’s
recognition of an individual by
electing him to membership im-
poses upon him far greater
citizen responsibilities than he
has ever had before. In the final
analysis, however, the com-
pleteness of the ODK idea
comes with the realization that
the greater obligation to serve
is the price of ability.”

The ODK idea. must have
been ripe for its time, as the
society quickly added circles at
Johns Hopkins and the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. There are
now more than 110 circles in col-
leges and universities
throughout the country. One of
the founders’ Professor
Emeritus Rupert Latture, now
85, is still active in W&L affairs
and has ‘an office adjacent to
President Robert Huntley’s.

The first curveball pitcher?
W&L claims that'honor, too’
although it is not well
documented. According to Bill
Washburn in the Alumni Office,
a man by the name of George A.
Sykes, class of 1869, was the na-
tion’s first curveballer. He said
there was a write-up on it in the
Lexington Gazette in which the
reporter said Sykes did ‘‘a scur-
vy thing by throwing a curvey
ball.” Washburn said the first
catcher of a curve ball was
William M. McElwee. Both
McElwee’s and Sykes, portraits
are in the Alumni House.
Washburn said McElwee went
on to become president of Peo-
ple’s Bank, now the First Na-
tional Exchange Bank.

Kappa Alpha was another
W&L first. It was established
on Dec. 21, 1865 by four W&L
students. A plaque now stands

Desire Under the Elms review W{ock Convention

(continued from page 3)

something as symbolic and
complex as Eben’s fixation for
the farm, nor so apparently
self-effacing. (He wants the
farm for his mother.)

Chester does a fine job with
this most difficult task. I find it
hard to say how or why, but
perhaps this is a tribute to the

seamless nature of. his
characterization, stretched bet-
ween these two extremes.

Jim Weatherstone presents
us with a wonderfully am-
bigious Ephraim Cabot. From
his first entrance with his new
wife, Abbie, he establishes
himself as the ruler, imposing
himself upon the state. O’Neill
and Weatherstone take us on a
bit of a roller coaster ride with
this character, for he is at one
time dominant and failing. He
would drive Eben off the farm
when he learns of the affair bet-
ween him and Abbie, yet he can
muster only a crazed little look
when he learns that the baby,
accredited falsely to him, is
dead. But, this ambiguity is a
vital part of Ephraim. He’s a

lonely man, meant to be alone.

None of his three wives have

been able to share in the world.

he inhabits.

Ellen Jervey’s Abbie is pro-
bably the most difficult of all
these complex characters, as
far as portrayal goes. For it is
finally through her, that we are
able to see some growth in the
ability to share one life with
another. And it is the various
schemes and strings pulled by
Abbie which make the play go,
as she forces her way into the
world of both Ephraim and
Eben. The great danger with
Abbie is to ‘‘lose’’ her at one of
the mid-points, before she
reaches the final state of
unselfish love for Eben.

Homemade Soup

Although this realization in Ab-
bie could have been made more
clear, Jervey handles the
modulation necessary for a suc-
cessful Abbie quite well.

Hunt Brown and Jeff Bun-
trock should also be commend-
ed on their jobs as the two older
brothers of Eben, Simeon and
Peter. They exist to counter-
point Eben early in the play, in
order to show his limited verbal
powers and his dreams about
the farm.

Turning for a moment to the
technical side of the ledger,
there is only one observation to
make. Again Tom Ziegler has
come through in a_ pinch,

designing the cracker-box
Troubadour into submission
with the director’s ideas.

In fact, there is but one
adverse remark that can be
said for this production of
Desire Under the Elms. And
that is those blasted musical
blackouts... In several places,
the lively bluegrass just didn’t
fit, and in general the music’s
happy sound pulled the au-
dience off course and tended to
destroy the emotional tension of
the play itself.

announced Art Dunnan, Co-
Ordinator of this year’s event.

The doors of the student
center complex will open at 8:30

two entrances this year, to
eliminate the long lines that oc-

VOLUME LXXVII

by Jim Barnes

Rocked by scandal from the
outset to the conclusion of his
tenure as SAB co-chairman,
Charlie Hulfish still .remains a
controversial person after.his
conviction of an honor offense
by the Executive Committee
two weeks ago.

The first controversy came
early this academic year when
the Ring-tumPhi reported that

upon the Duke Ellington Or-
chestra, but several other at-
tractions have been contracted
by the SAB and will be on hand
throughout the night, starting at
8:30. Of special interest will be

‘tthe appearance of ‘‘Jameela,”

a professional belly-dancer, in
the Cockpit. In the EC room,
George Fischoff, a jazz pianist,
will be performing. Mr.
Fischoff is a familiar face to
many W&L students, having
appeared here before as part of
the Cockpit Coffeehouse circuit.

In keeping with the mystical
Egyptian theme, the SAB has
also arranged for presentations
by John-Ivan Palmer. Palmer,
a “‘mentalist” and expert in the
area of extra-sensory percep-
tion, will perform in the televi-
sion lounges on the second level

Hulfish acquired a nointerest
loan. E.C. votes rallied around
Hulfish and he remained SAB
co-chairman--for a while. Look-
ing back to September, senior
EC representative Mike Missal
commented, ‘‘We should have
kicked him out (off of the SAB)
then.” SAB members said
outright, “‘Nobody trusted him
with money or tickets.’’ Hulfish
admitted as much to the Ring-

of the Student Center.

Movies will be shown con-
tinually in Room 114, next to the
television rooms. Among the
titles are such Egyptian treats
as “The Mummy’s Tomb,”
“Abbott and Costello in the
Foreign Legion,’ Bugs Bunny
starring in ‘‘Ali Baba Bunny,”
and more.

Pictures of you and your date
will be available from Andre’
Studios, whose representative
will be set up in the Student
Center library. For $6.50, one
can purchase 4 wallet photos,
and two larger prints.

terest — The rumor is true that
the first Egyptian sight visible
as one approaches the ball, will

And finally, a_ historic
note...Many have asked who the
founder of the Fancy Dress Ball
was: the best answer is to refer
them to a large portrait in the
reference room of McCormick
Library. It is a likeness of Miss
Annie Jo White, a Washington
and Lee librarian. She founded
the ball in 1907 as a private mas-
querade party (not your
stereotyped “dull” librarian,
was Miss White). The event
gained popularity by leaps and
bounds, and by 1913, it was an
established tradition for the en-
tire campus. (McCormick

Student Control actions
questioned by EC members

by Randy Smith

The powers, procedures, and
operation of the Student Control
Committee came under close
scrutiny during a long and
painstaking Executive Commit-
tee meeting Monday night. (The
SCC handles cases of student
misconduct and is composed of
thepresident and vice-president
of each academic class and law
school representatives. )

Most of the EC’s questions
concerned the standard Student
Control procedure of con-
ducting a preliminary in-
vestigation of a reported inci-
dent before the case is con-
sidered by the full committee.
Questions also arose about the
SCC’s ‘‘STatement on the Pur-
pose and Procedures of the Stu-
dent Control Committee,’’ and
the rights of persons brought
before the committee for acts of
misconduct.

Jim MeNider, chairman of
the Student Control Committee,
explained the need for a
preliminary investigation as a
clarification of the cir-
cumstances involved in the
case. Information is gathered
by the investigator — who is
often McNider — to determine
the nature of the case for

 

presentation to the committee.
E.C. law representatives
Jackie Boyden and Tom Healy
raised many questions about
the need for a preliminary in-
vestigation of a student miscon-
duct case. Healy argued that
the process of discovering the
circumstances of a case during
a preliminary investigation is
exactly what happens when the
full committee hears the case,
thereby making the
preliminary investigation un-

necessary. —

McNider explained that a
preliminary investigation helps
determine ‘‘the nature of the
problem,”’ and also provides a
“‘framework’’ for questions.
‘“‘Convening the committee is a
great logistical problem,”’
MeNider said, “‘we need all the
facts before us.”’

He also explained that a
preliminary investigation

determines if a case will be

An SAB member recently in-
quired, “In that last Fancy
Dress article, you mentioned
the ‘figrue! What exactly is
that?” The Washington Post,
in one of its last articles on the
traditional ball in the 1960’s,
said this: ‘‘The balls centered
on the ‘figure,’ a cotillion-like
dance in which the couples
formed the shape of the univer-
sity’s crest, a four-sectioned
blue, red and yellow shield with
a noble bird and a bottom rib-
bon on which is inscribed ‘Non
In Cautus Futuri,’ The universi-
ty motto meaning ‘Not unmind-
ful of the Future.’ ‘‘ Am-

SAB removes member

by Galen Trussell

The Student Activities Board
voted to remove a member
from the board, and add a new
member at a meeting held Sun-
day night.

The Board voted unanimously
to add Bill Ridge as a new
member at large. SAB
Chairmen Bill Tucker’ said
Ridge should have been on the
board a lot earlier because of
the work he has been doing.
Tucker said he had been in-
formed by Jim Underhill and
other members of the EC that it
was within his power to add or
remove members from the
board. Tucker said he thought it
would be better if the whole
board voted on the matter.

The SAB also voted to remove
Glen Stanford as member-at-
large and film comittee co-
chairman, According to Bill
Tucker, the committee decided
that Stanford’s performance
wasn’t up to par. The remaining
film committee chairman,
Steve Mangan said Stanford
was unavailable to correct
minor problems with films and
that he was not doing the work.

In other action, the board
decided not to schedule a con-
cert in March. The board had
earlier decided to attempt to
contact the Outlaws and
Sealevel for a March 17 date,

‘and Firefall for an April date.

Law students propose

Honor Code revisions

Reprinted with permission of
W&L Law News
by John F. Allevato

A subcommittee of the Stu-
dent Bar Association Board of
Governors, appointed to draw
up various reform proposals for
the Honor Code tentatively has
submitted a list of possible
reforms that will be acted upon
by the SBA Board of Governors
as soon as possible.

William Garrett, first year
class president and a member
of the committee, emphasized
that the proposals are intended
to strengthen the present
system, and that the subcom-
mittee, after receiving input
from other law students, is not
advocating the creation of
separate honor systems for the
law school and_ the
undergraduates.

The proposals center upon
more clearly defining the limit
and scope of the Honor Code,
and upon precedural reforms.

Among the various proposals
included in the subcommittee’s
report is strict limitations of
honor code violations to those
involving lying, cheating, and
stealing. According to Garrett,
the activities which could
violate the Honor Code at this
time are vague and need
greater definition.

Another proposal would limit
geographic jurisdiction of the
Honor System to areas where a
W&L_ student’ srepresents
himself as a W&L student, and
someone relies upon that
representation. Additionally,
Rockbridge County would serve
as a quasi-boundary for viola-
tions. At this time, there is no
limit on the jurisdiction of the

Food co-op
takes stride

Jerry Darrell, manager of all
three W&L food services, will
hold a meeting on “kitchen
management” next week — the
first toward a fraternity food
cooperative.

Darrell announced the ses-
sion at this week’s IF.C.
meeting. He said that the pur-
pose of the management session
was to ‘“‘see what we need to do”’
before setting-up a food co-op.
In future weeks, Darrell plans
to have problem solving
‘“‘workshops’’ to help fraternity
food managers perform their
duties more efficiently.

‘IT don’t have time to help run
a food co-op’”’ Darrell said. But
he will help food managers set-
up the framework.

Waste is the problem Darrell
considers most important. He
said that currently, most food
managers do not keep the
necessary paperwork their job
requires. “You have to know
what you’re buying, keep
records on quantity, so that you
know what you need,” Darrell
emphasized.

The kitchen management ses-
sion will be held in a meeting
room along the side of Evans
Dining Hall this Wednesday at 4
p.m. Anyone interested is in-
vited to attend.

honor system.

The subcommittee also has
recommended that the three EC
members who investigate the
reported violation not be allow-
ed to vote on the guilt or in-
nocence of the accused, and
that of the three investigators of
the EC, one of them must be
from the school of the accused
(i.e. Commerce School, Law
School, etc.)

At the closed EChearing, the
only person allowed to speak on
his own behalf is the accused.
The subcommittee would like to
see that changed to allow the
accused’s advisors a chance to
question witnesses and to speak
for him. The SBA committee
felt, however, that only the ac-
cused should make the final
statement on his behalf.

Additionally, the subcom-
mittee would like to see
graduated penalties instead of
the single sanction available
now. At the option of the EC, the
subcommittee’s report says an
accused found guilty could be
permitted to reapply for admis-
sion after a designated time of
dismissal.

Another proposal would
remove all notations from a
guilty student’s school records”’

 

 

he record, thus, would state
only in a public trial, his record
is noted that the student was
asked to leave because of an
honor violation.

Other proposals would re-
quire a three-quarter’s vote (it
is now two-thirds) for convic-
tion by the EC and the student
jury; that an accused by told
the names of his accusers, or
that he be told their names and
a chance to interview them;
and that the language in the
Honor Code be made more
‘“‘neuter.”’

The subcommittee would also
like to see a third law school EC
representative so that each
class has their own represen-

Overwhelming vote

IFC usurps Contact receptions

Steve Mattesky, president of
the Interfraternity Council,
oversaw the overwhelming ap-
proval of a motion for the I.F.C.
to select the fraternity houses
holding cocktail parties before
a Contact lecture.

Mattesky introduced the mo-
tion at the end of Tuesday’s
I.F.C. meeting to ensure the
fairness of the cocktail party
selection procedure. The mo-
tion was adopted unanimously.
(The I.F.C. helped found the
Contact Committee and
regularly contributes at least a
third of Contact’s expense
money.)

Earlier in the meeting, the
Fraternity Inspection commit-
tee handed out newly compiled

monthly checklists of safety re-

I.F.C. will monitor the lists of
items ‘‘which should be attend-
ed to on a frequent basis.”’

The Inspection Committee
will make an inspection in about
two weeks, and hope to have a
report on the condition of each
house by the end of March.

Dr. Thomas Imeson, chair-
man of the Fraternity Inspec-
tion Committee, told the I.F.C.
that during an inspection his
committee has great reluctance
to enter fraternity residents,
rooms. ‘‘We try to make it a
policy not to go into an in-

said.

March concert out
SAB removes Stanford,

instates new member

“If the SAB were operating
under last year’s procedures, it
would have already had acts
lined up for the March event,”’
Tucker said. He added, ‘‘Offers
came over the break, but the
board couldn’t decide on them,
so we couldn’t reply to the of-
fers.”

Tucker was refering to an EC
decision which made it man-
ditory that the entire SAB vote
on which band to contact for
concerts.

Tucker added he thought it
was important that SAB not
pool all its resources for one big
concert in the Spring. He said
one big concert tends to alienate
some people, while more little
ones touch base with
everybody.

Tucker emphasized that the
board would be deciding next
week what kind of entertain-
ment should be scheduled bet-
ween Fancy Dress and the Spr-
ing term.

 

Culture counselor
Husson here on 4th

Roland Husson, deputy
cultural counselor to the French
Embassy in Washington, D.C.,
will be at Washington and Lee
Unviersity March 3 in conjunc-
tion with the opening of the ex-
hibition ‘French Cathedrals”
in the duPont Gallery.

“French Cathedrals’ is a
photographic essay on the
development of French
medieval architecture.

Husson will deliver a slide
lecture on “Paris Tomorrow’”’
in the duPont auditorium at 8
p.m. He will focus on the highly
controversial Centre Pom-
pidou, a Parisian example of
ultra-modern architecture
which functions as a center of
‘living art.”’

galJeries and work spaces free
of obstructions.

Modernists praise the
building while traditionalists
say it destroys the harmony
that exists among the buildings
where it is located, one of the
oldest sections of Paris.

Husson says his choice of a
topic is in keeping with the
W&L exhibition on Gothic ar-
chitecture which was called, in
its time, ‘‘the modern style.”’

Husson was born and
educated in Paris. He has been
professor of French literature
in France, Australia and the
United States. He has also been
French cultural attache in San-
tiago, Chile and San Francisco.

The gallery is open to the
public from 9 to 5 on weekdays.

 
Frats need legal eagles

part 4 of a series
"by Randy Smith

When other, more subtle
methods of persuasion fail,
fraternities do have a legal
alternative they can employ to
secure payment of members’
unpaid bills.

Eric L. Sisler, a Lexington at-
torney retained by Washington
and Lee University for legal
counsel, outlined various legal
actions fraternities might con-
sider for the collection of debts
incurred by fraternity
members.

The issuance of a debt war-
rant was Sisler’s strongest
recommendation. Collection on
a debt warrant is similar to a
petition filed in small claims
court.

A verbal contractural agree-
ment is the most common prac-
tice for the billing of members
by fraternities. Attorney Sisler
said that a verbal contract is as
valid as a written contract in
Virginia, but the debt warrant
must be filed within three years
after the debt was incurred.

The fraternity’s treasurer or
any officer of the fraternity can
be designated to file a debt war-
rant (costing $5.50), and to pro-
ve to the judge that the in-
dividual has debts outstanding.
The sheriff then serves the war-
rant on the debtor with a sum-
mons to appear in court for pay-
ment of the debt.

Once a judgement is made
against the debtor in court, his
credit rating suffers, which
possibly hinders later attempts
to secure a loan or obtain other
credit financing.

If immediate funds to settle
the debt are still lacking at trial
time, the court can seize per-
sonal property or garnish the
debtor’s wages to ensure pay-
ment of the debt. Attorney
Sisler noted that the court does
not recognize special treatment
for “hardship cases” (persons

Phi Beta Kappa

Matthai

honored

William H. Matthai, a student
at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity, has reeeived the Phi Beta
Kappa Sophomore Award.

The award, given annually by
the Washington and Lee
chapter of Phi Beta Kappa,
goes to the sophomore with the
highest grade-point average
through the fall term of his se-
cond year. He receives books
valued up to $25.

Matthai is the son of Mr. and
Mrs. William H. Matthai of 212
Tunbridge, Rd., Baltimore. He
attended the Gilman School.

At Washington and Lee, Mat-
thai is a member of the
honorary scholastic fraternity
Phi Eta Sigma and the social
fraternity Phi Kappa Psi. He is
also a member of the College
Republications and is active in
the University Theater.

from a financially disadvantag-
ed background).

However, Sisler did not that if
the person issued a debt war-
rant pays his bills before the
trial date, there would be no tar-
nish on his personal record
because there had not been a
court judgement.

In the case of graduates who
have left W&L and the state of
Virginia, Sisler said that the
debt claim is still valid, but
must be pursued in the state
where the defendent now lives.

As an alternative settlement
of unpaid bills, counsel Sisler
said a promissory note could be
used to guarantee payment of
large outstanding debts. A pro-
missory note is a written agree-
ment between the debtor and
creditor for payment of the debt
on terms agreed upon by the
two. They are inexpensive and
legally binding. Copies of both
‘demand’ and “‘time’’ pro-
missory notes are in Dean Mur-
phy’s office.

Sisler suggested that to help
curtail bill collection problems,
fraternities set ‘‘a maximum
credit limit’’ for all members at
the beginning of the year.
Failure to keep under the credit
limit might result in the loss of

house privileges or other
similar punitive action, Sisler
offered.

He also recommended that
fraternities collect a ‘‘deposit’’
from each member to make
people “more attentive to their
bills.”” The deposit money could
also be used as a reserve fund to
cover somé short-term ex-
penses.

The attorney’s third sugges-
tion was to obtain a parental
guarantee of their son’s debts.

‘‘Fraternities are a
business,’”’ Sisler said. ‘Your
house can’t function if you have
financially irresponsible people
burdening the other members
with their debts.”

Hulfish has remained in the
public eye as a result of his
business activites on campus.
He has been selling Fancy
Dress t-shirts for almost two
weeks in the Student Center lob-
by and later in the Co-op. It
seems as though Hulfish ap-
proached the SAB with a pro-
posal to sell Fancy Dress t-
shirts. At that time what the
SAB did not know, was that they
had already been ordered by
Hulfish. According to one SAB
member ‘“‘he (Hulfish) said that
they had already been
ordered.”’ The SAB decided to
reject Hulfish’s proposal
anyway. This left Hulfish with a
sizable investment on_ his
hands. Hulfish remained on
campus to sell the t-shirts.
Missal said, ‘I have seen
Charlie up in the SAB office fre-
quently using the telephone.”

Hulfish began selling the t-
shirts two weeks ago, the day
after he was convicted by the

E.C.

Hulfish told Jerry Darrell
Wednesday that he could no
longer sell the t-shirts in the
Student Center because Mike
Cappeto, chairman of the Stu-
dent Center, said the facility
was getting too crowded with
the SAB decorators for Hulfish
to continue selling the t-shirts
there.

However, the Ring-tum-Phi
has learned that Wednesday
morning Cappeto received a
call from Dean of Students
Lewis John expressing his con-
cern:.over business ventures
conducted in the Student Center
by non-University personnel.

Darrell said he approved
Hulfish’s request to sell the t-
shirts in the Co-op because, as
Darrell put it, “I felt that if this
was something that the students
wanted, then I’d let him sell
them in the Co-op. But once
Darrell was informed of the in-

tentions of some of the E.C.
members to seek his expulsion
from campus, he agreed to go
along with whatever the E.C.
decide.

Wednesday morning Missal
confronted Hulfish in the Co-op
and told him to leave campus.
According to Missal Hulfish
said he wouldn’t move unless
“somebody like Dean John tells
me to.’’ When Missal informed
Hulfish that he would not be
able to attend fancy dress,
Missal said Hulfish replied,
“Bullshit. I’m going anyways,
and I’m going to have fun.”’

Missal went to Dean John for
assistance in resolving the
issue. Missal said, ‘Dean John
told him to get off campus.”
Missal also added that Dean
John made it clear to Hulfish
that he wouldn’t be able to at-
tend fancy dress. John would
neither confirm or deny
Missal’s story. John said, “I
don’t feel that I should com-
ment on _ individual honor
cases.’’ However, John did say,
“TI will work with the Executive
Committee to help enforce the
policies of the E.C.”

Missal told the Ring-tum-Phi
that the E.C. should have acted
sooner to see that Hulfish was
removed from campus. Missal
said “It should have been
brought up at 'Monday’s

Few colleges have a national-
ly rated swimmer, John Hud-
son. Fewer still have a Rhodes
Scholar, Mark Bradley. Even
fewer have both a John Hudson
and a Mark Bradley. But only
W&L has a John Hudson, a
Mark Bradley, and a Penn
Plummer. Whoa! — wait a
minute; who, or what, is a Penn
Plummer? The _ red-headed
native of East Liverpool, Ohio,
filled with tough words, eccen-
tricities, and latent humility,
graduated from Choate, (known
more for its ironclad con-
formism in the name of non-
conformity than for its wealth
of individualistic thinkers), in
1973.

So he’s an eccentric preppy;
what’s the big deal? After all,
Lexington has more than its fair
share of abnormal, or rather,
normal people. But only Penn
Plummer has the unearned
distinction of completing his
senior year with Phi Beta
Sigma, Magna cum Laude, the
American Legion Award for
scholastic excellence, all re-
quirements completed for a
double major in European
History and German, and Phi
Beta Kappa and not being
allowed to graduate for not
fulfilling his phys. ed. obliga-
tion.

The details of Plummer’s
plight seems to weigh in his
favor. Evidently, Penn fell vic-
tim to varicose veins in his
junior year, along with further
complications, which complete-
ly debilitated him. This medical
impairment precluded Plum-
mer from taking any more gym
classes or from participating
actively in the ROTC program.
On April 2, 1977, the ROTC
department honorably
discharged their scholar for
medical reasons, (undaunted
by the adversity of the situa-
tion, however, Plummer plans
to enlist after this year).

But, according to Plummer,
Dr. Frederick A. Feddeman
and Assistant Athletic Director,
Dick Miller, denied the con-
valescing senior his diploma for
supposedly trying to skirt his
physical education require-
ment. But when a dismayed

 

‘‘Some people consider me a fascist. I find that association per-
sonally repugnant as it tends to identify me with the dirty, sweaty

Plummer tried to explain the
obvious physical impediments
to his taking Badmitton 101 and
other enlightening courses, his
pleas fell on deaf ears. Miller
responded by telling Plummer
that he should have taken all his
phys. ed. courses in his
freshman and sophomore
years.

By combining good sport-
smanship with sarcasm, Plum-
mer now says, ‘‘As far as my
personal relations with Dick
Miller are concerned, I regard
Dick Miller as a saint; and the
sooner he’s sainted, the better
I'll feel.”” But, as the perpetual
student, the Castro look-alike
feels he has learned something
from this ordeal. “This ex-
perience has done much to
erode my faith in an ad-
ministrator or a doctor merely
because of his position. In the
future, such a man would have
to personally inspire confidence
in me to gain my trust.”

But being a Phi Beta Kap-
pa/Doremus carryover is only
half of the Penn Plummer

story. During his four plus’

years in Lexington, he has
found himself emboiled in rag-
ing controversy and surrounded

by gnawing and undying:

rumors. The one controversy
more than any other that
brought Plummer campus-wide
notoriety was his mysterious
minimization of ties with Sigma
Phi Epsilon following an inci-
dent involving the house

brothers of Phi Gamma Delta.
The story behind the controver-
sy pits a loaded gun-toting
Plummer threatening two in-
nocently tipsy FIJIs upon insuf-
ficient provocation and subse-
quently wildly chasing the two
into the street. Following the
assumed near-tragedy, Plum-
mer was more or less forced to
leave SPE.

But Penn has his side to the
story. First he says concerning
the incident itself, “I never
drew a loaded gun on anyone
during my stay at Sigma Phi
Epsilon nor did I ever chase
anybody with a loaded gun. I
have, however, reacted as I
thought appropriate to main-
tain my personal security.”
Plummer elaborates on his
following withdrawal from
SPE. ‘‘My self-imposed exile
from Sigma Phi Epsilon was a
culmination of a process that
had been going on for about two
years. I identified myself with
the OLD GUARD of the frater-
nity and with their absence, I
found very little incentive to
stay in the fraternity. My in-
bred distaste for political fac-
tionism and Roberts Rules of
Order were important factors in
this decision also.”’

Whether the widely-accepted
version or the Plummer version
of the incident held true or
whether the SPE exile was forc-
ed or voluntary, Penn is now en-
joying his status as a social
member in Zeta Beta Tau,

Plummer: if unique is what you seek...

which he says is “very open
minded, tolerant, and lots of
fun.”” His personal feelings
toward SPE today have been
ameliorated because of recent
trends and events within the
house itself. ‘‘I understand that
some of the conditions which I
found intolerable have now im-
proved considerably. I am
pleased that the future looks
brighter for the Virginia Ep-
silon chapter.”’

Plummer has always been a
forthright and stubborn conser-
vative. The needs of rightist
thinking which parental
breeding planted in Plummer’s
mind sprouted at Choate,
(where he despised the pseudo-
doctrine of ‘revolution for the
hell of it’), matured at home,
and grew to fruition at
Washington and Lee. This
Milton Friedman attitude of
“There ain’t no free lunch,”
buttressed by his strong
militaristic tendencies have
spawned not so gracious
rumors about Plummer, his
views and his character. In
response to a recent rumor, uni-
que to Washington and Lee,
identifying Penn as the campus
fascist, Plummer, seizing upon
a rather snooty attitude,
retorts, “One of my great
regrets at being labeled ‘Cam-

 

= ‘Anything can happen in America.”

 

pus Fascist’ is that it identifies
me with the grubby, sweaty
masses. I find the association
repugnant.”

But another’ spurious
longstanding rumor, leaving no
room for levity, tags Plummer
as a Nazi both in his character
and in his political views. Since
his days at Choate, Plummer
has been alleged of being
everything from a closet Nazi to
an owner of a bar of soap pro-
duced in Warsaw in 1942. He has
consistently denied all of these
assertions. (For example to
prove his aversion to being a
closet Nazi, Plummer, using his
most effective weapon, his mor-
dent wit, has hung flags of the
Third Reich in his closet).

Yet the ugly rumors persist.
Plummer angers over his sup-
posed link to Nazism because
that philosophy contradicts
directly with his “distaste for
national socialism, fear of mass
uprisings in general, and a
hatred of demogogues.”’ Fur-
thermore Plummer contends
that ‘“‘Nazism was Hitlerism
and centered around the cult of
the leader figure.” To combat
two aspects of his much malign-
ed reputation, the soap rumor
and his alleged pro-Hitler and
totalitarian sentiments, Plum-

Hints to help

 

 

Reading problems

About 85 percent of the work
you do as a college student in-
volves reading. It is the single
most important learning skill,
and yet many students are bog-
ged down in poor reading habits
that can make studying a chore.

Reading is the visual ability
to understand words and their
relationship one to another. To
improve reading skills you
must increase your capacity to
see and grasp the grouping of
words, or ideas, at a speed that
is comfortable for you. The key
is to move your eyes at a rate
that allows your prain to absorb
the main ideas printed on a
page.

Remember, your eyes, like
fingers for the piano or legs for
jogging, must be trained to be
skillful. If you would like to tune
up your reading skills, these
basic steps will help.

STEP 1—EVALUATE YOUR
READING HABITS

Do you vocalize words in your
mind, or move your lips as you
read? You may be using the
childhood habit of sounding out
each word. This slows you
down.

Do strange words constantly
stop your’ progress? Your

vocabulary needs improving.

Do you read every single
word separately? Train your
eyes to span phrases and to
group thoughts units together.

Do you have to back up and
reread very often? You are not
paying attention. Force
yourself to concentrate.

Do you read everything at the
same speed? Your speed should
vary with the subject matter.

Are you reading faster now
than when you were in high
school? Skillful reading is an
art and needs continual prac-
tice.

STEP 2—PROVIDE THE
RIGHT ATMOSPHERE

To read effectively, you need
to set the scene for concentra-
tion. Pick a quiet place where
you-can read with a minimum
of interruption. Have a pencil
ready for taking notes.

Most individuals find that 15

inches away from their eyes is a
comfortable distance to hold a
book. Make sure the lighting is
good.
Radio, television, and music,
all pull your attention away
from the words and ideas you
are readying.

Ring-tum Phi, Feb. 24, 1978, Page 5

The quotable Plummer

(continued from page 4)

mer reflects that genocide was
“a manifestation of Hitler’s
personality” and adds, “Any
system that tends to regard peo-
ple as a mass, as a monolithic
block and which has as its goal
the general leveling of people
within that society I find abhor-
rent. I believe in liberty before
equality. I would like to say that
I adhere to what I believe to be
the principles of those men who
framed the Constitution and the
Bill of Rights.”’ Concluding that
the difficulties of his reputation
bear no solution, Plummer, in
an interesting blend of resigna-
tion and self-reliance, says,
“There are people who,
regardless of what I say, regard
me as a Nazi and continue to
think of me as a reincarnation
of Hitler. I can do very little to
change their minds about me. I
regard their actions toward me,
motivated by this Hitlerite im-
age, as I would regard an infant
of six months soiling his diaper
while I hold him; it is regret-
table and unpleasant, but, as
there is nothing I can do about
it, I don’t let it bother me.”’
Looking back over his years
at Washington and Lee, Plum-
mer feels he has_ gotten
everything he asked for and
more. His reflections on various
aspects of W&L life portray
either a hardening cynicism or
an ongoing faith in tradi-
tionalism. Commenting on the
Honor Code, Plummer quips, ‘‘I
like the idea of the Honor Code;
I wish it worked.’’ Plummer
blasts ‘preppies,’ (in the W&L
context), by postulating, ‘I
think there is a distorted image
of what a W&L man should be.
The fact that this image is self
perpetuating does not, in my
opinion, make it either ap-

Library
Construction

Ahead

Construction is ahead of
schedule on Washington and
Lee University’s new $9.26-
million undergraduate library
building, and the university now
expects to move into it during
the Christmas holiday in
December this year. The
130,000-Square-foot building is
located directly behind
Washington Hall on the main
W&L campus and will have a
capacity of 500,000 volumes and
individual study space for 800
students. Plans call for the
eventual remodeling of McCor-
mick Hall, the current library
building, to become the new
home of W&L’s School of Com-
merce, Economics and Politics
after the library moves into its
new facility and when funds for
the renovation become
available. In turn, Newcomb
Hall, currently the home of the
commerce school, will be
remodeled to provide needed
expansion room for The Col-
lege, W&L’s arts-and-sciences
division.

propriate or desirable. 1 refer,
of course, to that  khaki-
trousered preppiedom whose
major attributes seem to be
clannishness, academic
mediocrity, a highly pressured
social life, and a taste in music
requiring cloth ears.”

In response to a question for
his opinion on the recent
disclosure in the RtP about a
preferential admissions policy
toward Lexingtonian and black
applicants, Plummer com-
ments, “‘As I am a believer in
the maintenance of tradition,
the only possible condition
where I would condone
preferential treatment of an ap-
plicant, where there were two
applicants of equal merit and
one being the son of an alum-
nus, would be the choosing of
the son of an alumnus.” On a
positive note, Penn feels that
the Ring-tum Phi is fine as long
as it keeps him informed and in-
terested. But the departing fifth
year student hastens to add that
he misses the column ‘Ask
Traveller.’

Plummer’s response to the
recent RtP co-ed/social life
poll is realistic on the one hand

and strangely ambiguous on the
other. Concerning the W&L
social life, Penn calmly states
that, “‘There are ample op-
portunities to achieve social
prowess. It take an effort on the
part of the individual.” But
when queried on his feelings
toward co-education, Plum-
mer’s reaction is a fit of un-
controllable laughter; enough
to drive any interviewer to end,
(as I did with great speed and
little dexterity), the discussion
instantly.

So William Penn Plummer, a
Phi Beta Kappa confined to
Washington and Lee (due to an
athletic program which ‘did
not influence’ his decision to
come here “‘one iota’’) for an
additional year; caught in an in-
excapable predicament of prin-
ciples versus peer acceptance,
will take with him when he
graduates this spring, his
idiosyncracies, his sometimes
biting sense of humor, and.
most importantly, a visible ele-
ment of diversity that makes
Washington and Lee that much
more of an interesting and
broadening experience.

There is life after
college for ’77

by Paul Daugherty

There is life after college.

According to a report on the
class of 1977, issued earlier this
month by Mike Cappeto, direc-
tor of career development and
placement for the university,
more than 37 percent of last
year’s seniors entered graduate
and professional schools last
fall. The remaining graduates
entered directly into the job
market.

The report is based on a

survey sent last October to all.

May 1977 graduates of
Washington and Lee. Out of the
301 graduates, 249 responded to
the survey, almost 83 percent.

The study of law proved to be
the most popular postgraduate
field of education. Almost 13
percent of the class of 1977 went
on to law school.

Those entering medical and
dental schools last fall compos-
ed 8% percent of last year’s
graduating class, while 5 per-
cent entered MBA programs.

Business majors might be
surprised to learn that graduate
schools of business administra-
tion that recruit at W&L prefer
undergraduates with majors
other than business. Cappeto
said that one reason for this is
that business majors at
Washington and Lee might have
already had much of the
material covered in master’s
programs.

Those seniors who bypassed
graduate and professional pro-
grams and entered directly into

the job market were, for the
most part, satisfied with their
occupations, according to the
survey.

95.1 percent of those business
majors repsonding to the
survey believed that their pre-
sent jobs held career potential.
Underemployement, often a
major complaint of college
graduates, was not a problem
for the class of 1977, the survey
showed.

Of those responding to the
survey who had full time jobs,
76.1 percent said that their oc-
cupations required a college
degree. Of the remaining 23.1
percent who considered
themselves underemployed,
roughly half saw no future in
what they were doing.

By last October, almost nine
percent of the class of 1977 was
unemployed. The unemploy-
ment figure is ‘‘right around the
national average”’ for 1977 male
college graduates with a
bachelor of arts degree, ac-
cording to Cappeto.

The median annual starting
Salaries for W&L’s_ 1977
graduates was between $9,000
and $10,000, the survey showed.
This is below the national
average of ‘‘around $10,500”’ for
recent college grads, said Cap-
peto. Business and science
graduates earned the highest
median salary, between $10,000
and $11,000, while journalism
and communications graduates
were making the lowest,
averaging between $7,000 and
$8,000 annually.

Generals take 3 of 4.
over Wash.’s break

by Mark Mitchel

The Washington and Lee
basketball Generals completed
their regular season last week
by winning 3 of 4 away games.

On Saturday, they lost to Ran-
dolph Macon College, a Division
I school, 89-74.

Using a running and pressing
game, the Randolph Macon
Yellow Jackets jumped out toa
23-6 lead. Yet the Generals kept
working and pulled within two
at 44-42. After the Generals
missed an opportunity to tie the
game, the Yellow Jackets
tightened. Lead by penetrating
guard Kevin Woods, who had 21
points and a game high 11
assists, the Yellow Jackets
buzzed inside for easy shots to
take a 58-46 lead. Steve Sklaba

had a career high 32 points
against the Generals hitting on
12-of-15 shots from the field.
Macon’s great penetration
(after theGenerals almost tied
the game up, Macon scored ten
of its next 14 points on shots no
fartrer than one foot away)
allowed them to shoot 64 per-
cent for the game.

Even though they lost, there
were many bright spots for the
Generals. The brightest spot
was the play of sixth man,
Bruce Williams. Williams had
16 points, hitting on 8 of 13 shots
from the field, in addition to be-
ing the Generals’ leading re-
bounder.

The team connected on 10 of
10 free throws in the second half
and managed to shoot 96 per-
cent from the line for the game.

The Generals then won an ex-
hibition game against Brock
University, 92-89. In that game,
Dennis had 28 points, and
Smitherman was 5 for 5 from
the field. But perhaps was the

 

most important factor was the
Generals’ dominance on the
boards. Meyer had 11 rebounds,
while Williams had 10 (5 of
them offensive), as the
Generals outrebounded Brock
536 to 29.

Against the University of
Rochester, Pat Dennis scored
22 points to move pass
Rochester coach Mike Neer into
seventh place on the all time
Washington and Lee scoring
list. Dennis had scored over
1300 points for Washington and
Lee. The Generals took com-
mand early and coasted to a
81-74 victory over Rochester.
Larry Meyer also had 22 points
for the Generals. Meyer and-
Dennis shared high rebounding
honors, each with 8. These Re-

bounds were important because
centers Collins and Smither-
man, and junior forward Dave
Leunig all fouled out.

The Generals then travelled
to Bridgewater.For the tenth
straight time, Washington and
Lee defeated the Eagles, this
time the Eagles lost 95-91.

Many Generals ended the
regular season on a promising
note. Bruce Williams led all
scorers with 24 points, hitting on
12 of 18 from the field. Williams
was only one of five double
figure scorers for the Generals.
Dennis had 22, Smitherman had
16 (7 out of 13 from the field),
Meyer had 15 (also 7 out of 13
from the floor), and Leunig had
12 points. Smitherman also had
11 rebounds as the Generals
outrebounded the wingless
Eagles 46-28.

Thus, the Generals concluded
a successful regular season
with a 19-5 record.

Swimmers eye State Crown

by Jerry Harris
and Neil Cote

After an easy conquest of Old
Dominion and a forfeit over
Virginia Commonwealth
University during the holiday
break, the W&L Generals
swimming team is preparing
for the very important State
Championship Swimming Meet
to be held this weekend.

The Generals had an easy
time of it against the homestan-
ding O.D. Monarchs breezing to
a 68-39 win on Saturday, Feb. 11.
VCU forfeited their scheduled
meet with the Generals due to
an outbreak of the flu that
debilitated the team. However,
W&L will get an opportunity to
face the Commonwealth club in
the state meet.

Commenting on the upcoming
match, Coach Stearns said,
“It’s going to be interesting.”’
The trials will begin Thursday
morning and end with the finals
on Saturday evening. All of the
events will be held at James
Madison University.

Obviously, the Generals see
this meet as a golden opportuni-
ty to prove that they are indeed
a swimming power in the state.
Even though W&L has posted
several winning seasons of late
and have had a number of All-
Americans they still face the
stigma of being a Division III
school which is trying to com-
plete on a Division I level. So
Coach Stearns and his charges
would like nothing better than
to win the state championships.

However, the likelihood of
that evening is slim. As Coach
Stearns points out the Universi-
ty of Richmond is a clear
favorite to capture the title.
“They should win,” declared
Stearns. ‘‘Not only do they have
some super swimmers but
they’re also large in numbers.”’
He went on to point out that
while W&L can only count on
mavbe 10 swimmers placing in
the meet, Richmond is likely to
have 19 or more to place. As a
result, even if the Generals go
one, two in a number of events,
they might still fall short.

Stearns sees a four-way battle
for second place with Virginia
Tech, VCU and William and
Mary challenging the Generals.

top swimmer since he was a
freshman, but having lived in
California all his life, he wanted
a change.

“T was tired of the state,’’ he
said. “I wanted a change of
pace. I decided to give an
eastern college a chance.”

Since coming to W&L, Kent
has been very happy with his
classes, the swim team and his
new friends.

“The fact that there weren’t

rugged six-foot swimmer said.
‘“‘But now that I’m here, I think
I made the right choice.”’

Kent, a_ history and
philosophy major who brought
a 3.3 grade-point average from
Claremont to W&L, has fitted in
well with the Generals’ swimm-
ing team. Already, he has
broken two school records, the
200 yard backstroke and the 200
yard individual medley.

The modest Kent attributes
much of his success to his
coach.

“Stearns knows as much or
more about swimming than
anyone else I know,”’ he said.

Generals are looking forward to
this weekend’s meet, Stearns
said a number of them are
understandably upset at having
to miss the Fancy Dress
weekend.

“Those are the breaks,”
Stearns said, “But the guys
have gone to far to let that
bother them.”’

Stearns, though optimistic
about his team’s chances at
Madison, concedes that the

The Generals, not to be out-

planning on putting on their

ODAC championships today

by Mark Mitchell

The Generals are aiming for
their second consecutive ODAC
tournament championship this
Friday and Saturday at Lyn-
chburg College. The Generals, a
team that has won twenty of
twenty-two ODAC games in the
last two years, and nine of their
last ten games, is seeded first in
the tournament. Finishing first
in the tournament guarantees
the team a berth in the NCAA
Division III tournament.

As first seed, the generals
take on the 5-19 Bridgewater
Eagles. The Generals seem to
be just too strong on the boards
and have too much depth for
Bridgewater, so the Generals
should beat Bridgewater for the
eleventh time in a row.

Dave Leunig goes up for shot.

They will either take on
Hampden-Sydney, the team
that accounts for Washington
and Lee’s only conference loss
or Lynchburg. The Generals
have a rough time with the
Tigers even when they win.
Some fans may recall that
Sydney missed several shots in
the waning seconds of the first
meeting this season that gave
the Generals a one point victory
over the Tigers on the W&L
court. Two years ago, the
Generals needed a 20 footer by
Larson with 5 seconds left to
beat Sydney by 1.

Should they play Lynchburg,
they will have to beat a good
team, three times in one season.
A difficult feat under any cir-
cumstances, made more dif-
ficult by the fact that Lyn-
chburg will be playing on their
home court. Over the years, the

in the Hornets’ own nest. The
team hopes that as many W&L
rooters as possible will make it
to Saturday night’s 8 p.m.
championship game in order to
help the Generals. Whether
they play Lynchburg or Sydney,
the game promises to be close

be close enough so that crowd

Swimmers

are 10-1

(continued from page 6)

Stearns, now in his twelfth
season as Swimmng coach, has
good reason to be happy. His
team finished the regular
season with a 10-1 record, the
best in the school’s history, and
stand a good chance at winning
the Virginia State Champion-
ships, to be held this weekend at
James Madison University in
Harrisonburg.

This is the best team I’ve
coached,” he said confidently.

The W&L swimming pro-
gram has consistantly produced
some of the best teams in the
country since it was started in
1920. Stearns has done well to
carry the tradition with a 82-33
record dating back to 1966.

balding coach said. ‘‘We have
found top athletes who ap-
preciate a good education and a
chance to swim for a good
team.”

Championships which will be
held at Grinell, Iowa from
March 11 to March 18.

The Generals finished ninth in
the championships last year
and Stearns says they should do
even better this season.

Going into the state match on-
ly three W&L swimmers are
qualified for the nationals —

’ John Hudson, Keith Romich

and freshman diver Jay Dies-
ing. However, Stearns fully ex-
pects five others to qualify this
weekend — Scott Duff, Peter

The citation to Emmer,
presented at the annual Lyn-

described ‘‘his signal contribu-

university’s image through in-

sportsmanship.”’

Each spring in Lexington, it
noted, ‘“‘a young man’s fancy
turns to love and lacrosse with
equal fervor.”’

The citation also commended
Emmer’s ‘‘strength of

Strips of multi-colored cor-
rugated paper of all shapes and
sizes dotted the student center’s
red carpet. Hammers pounded
together wooden frames.

“That won’t fit,’ said one
worker, complaining about the
need for more material needed
to cover the odd-shaped wooden
rectangular skeleton over the
Cockpit entrance.

‘Don’t worry,” said another,
‘once we get the paper on it you
won't be able to tell the dif-
ference.”’

Who would be diligent enough
to be working at 2:00 a.m., long
after the late movie had
flickered off the tube? Maybe
they should be called the Fancy
Dress Workaholics Club.
Regardless, The Student Ac-
tivities Board (SAB) is spen-
ding most of its waking hours
this week preparing for the
school’s biggest social event of
the year.

“We only have two more
nights to get ready,” says one
worker as he taps a piece of rip-
pled plastic-backed corrugated
paper ariy around around the
water fountain across the hall
from the TV room.

Town could care less
about Fancy Dress

by Jim Lynn

What does Fancy Dress mean
to the citizens of Lexington? Is
it a classic display of high-class
partying, or is it merely college
kids putting on their ‘monkey
suits’ and going crazy on grain
and beer?

This may come as a shock to
many students, but the mer-
chants and townspeople of Lex-
ington do not see Fancy Dress
weekend as Virginia’s answer
to Ft. Lauderdale over Easter
vacation. Most motels notice a
slight increase in occupancy
and it is tougher to get a dinner
reservation, but they see no

€ye and Lar:

Nostalgia is chic and memory
speaks: Fancy Dress Ball, 1942.

To this New England college
girl in the years just before
World War II there were three
events of prime social
significance. Dartmouth Car-
nival, The Harvard-Yale game
and Washington and Lee Fancy
Dress Ball. Althugh I didn’t
know where or what
Washington and Lee was, I had
certainly heard of its Ball. I suc-
ceeded in getting to Dartmouth
Carnival and Harvard-Yale
game right on schedule but dan-
cing at Fancy Dress didn’t
come along until I was well on
the way to becoming a Lex-
ington matron — and quite
visibly —motherhood.

The 1942 Fancy Dress Ball
had an awful poignancy. The
United States was at war follow-
ing the attack on Pearl Harbor
two months before. The
students of that year could look

reason to make any special
plans to accommodate fun-
seeking collegiates out on the
town. The Holiday Inn and the
Keydet-General report that all
of their rooms are filled for the
weekend, and reservations for
dinner at the Keydet-General
are booked. The Keydet-
General usually has special
rates for groups on big college
weekends, but since the majori-
ty of the rooms are being filled
with people having nothing to do
with Fancy Dress, no special
rates apply.

Those who put off getting
reservations for dinner will

ahead to only one future —
military service.

The aura of special elegance
was over us all. The invitation
was an elaborate as a command
appearance before the King of
England, (with an enclosed
numbered card to be presented
at the door). One thousand
glamourous. costumes were
shipped from Philadelphia to be
rented out to each couple for the
large sum of $5. Girls arrived in
town days ahead — using the
excuse that they must practice
for the figure which opened the
Ball.

At nine-thirty the doors of the
old gym were locked against all
late arrivals and the fanfare
began with an intricate figure.

dresses, each carrying an arm-
ful of bright red roses; their
escorts in white-tie and tails,

Lion’s Den which does not take
reservations on nights that they

The local tuxedo outlets for
Lexington perhaps do the big-
gest business over the weekend.
Mike Thorton of Alvin-Dennis
said that all of their available
tuxedos have been reserved.
Prices for tuxedos from Alvin-
Dennis run from $15 to $39, and
considering that they have
rented several hundred, they
have had slower weekends.

The flower merchants also
have a big increase in business.

Nobody staggered; no one saw
— or smelled — any sign of
alcohol. That alcohol was
around we did not doubt — but it
was discreetly nipped.

The floor stayed crowded —
and dry — until intermission at
one o’clock. Then w)on we went
to a ‘‘Supper.’’ Ham, roast beef,
scalloped oysters, molded
salads — ending with a fantasy
desert of sherbet draped in spun
sugar! The conversation was
light and local; for this night we
kept the world at bay.

We danced all night and
breakfasted in party clothes —
wilted red roses tossed away —

ed in memory. By June the

quite as large as the ones built
4500 years ago, this ones made
out of wood, not blocks.

Outside, heavy falling snow
on this wintry Tuesday evening
is painting an almost
Christmas-like atmosphere in
which the workers on the inside
are feverishly working, almost
like Santa’s elves.

Fancy Dress, or whatever
name you have for it, is pro-
bably even bigger than
Christmas or New Years Eve on
this small campus, especially
for Fancy Dress coordinator
Art Dunnam.

Dunnam, a sophomore, is a
wisp of a fellow. Tall and lean,
hs filled with energy needed to
do the job of putting it all
together, talked openly about
how the theme for this year’s
extravaganza, ‘A Night in
Egypt’, was conceived and con-
structed.

“Steve Mangan coame up
with the original idea,’ said
Dunnam, ‘and early this year
the board approved it.’’ Dun-
nam added tha that once the
theme was decided two people
were appointed to plan the
building, order materials and
organize workers, mostly SAB
member, to do the job.

Dunnam said he, along with
others like senior Jim
Foresman and chairman Bill
Tucker have been working
since the beginning of the term
on what many consider one of
the finest formal college dances
in the country.

As coordinator Dunnam
estimated he may have put in

four, 40-hour weeks already.
“Jim, (Foreman) who is also
treasurer,’ said Dunnam, “‘has
been working even longer.”’

Their work will not go un-
noticed. The outside doors
leading into the Dining Hall,
scene of the big ball, will be
guarded by two 6” by 7’ pain-
tings of Tutankhamen, an
Egyptian ruler from 14B.C.

Scattered among the piles of
loose paper and junk in the SAB
headquarters are innumerable
cardboard signs. Some tell of
the ‘*treasures of
Tutankhamen.’ There are
signs for coatrooms, dressing
rooms, signs telling you where
to go and what to do and who
will be doing it when you get
there. Colorful paper statues of
Nefertiti, Queen of the Nile, lay
strewn on the floor as remnants
of the months of planning which
all leads up to the big event
tonight. Paper mache palm
trees lay limp in the far side of
the room. Glitter, as one might
expect, is plentiful. ‘‘If it means
anything,’’ said Dunnam,
“‘we’ve used over two pounds of
glitter so far.”” Dunnam added
that he even tried to get Egyp-
tian travel posters for the dance
to enhance the atmosphere,
“but the travel service was all
out.”’

W&L students will have the
luxury of seeing a live camel
standing on the front porch of
Fairfax Lounge. ‘‘We’ve rented
him,”’ said Dunnam, ‘“‘and his
keeper will be dressed in egyp-
tian attire.”

The lounge itself will have

who want to escape the noise
and confusion in the ballrooom
for a few minutes, namely
Maria Muldaur’s ‘Midnight at

Now transformed into what
appears to be a caravan tent,
the Cockpit will be lit by a varie-
ty of colored lights glowing
from their nests in the ceiling.
Exotic belly dancer ‘‘Jameela’”’
will perform, as will pianist
George Fischoff, on and off
throughout the mght. Free soft
drinks will be served for those
who tire of the Lowenbrau dark,
Miller and Miller ‘‘Lite’”’ being
served in the ballroom.

In fact, according to Dunnam,
over 90 kegs of the foamy brew
will be used, served at the new-
ly constructed 30 foot long
wooden bar. “‘The bar cost us
$580 to build,” said Dunnam,
“but it saves us the trouble of
lugging down all those filing
cabinets from the SAB office.”

Dunnam said the big surprise
will come from the art studio
over in Dupont Hall. Art pro-
fessor Dr. I-Hsuing Ju has
painted some pictures especial-
ly for the occasion, but to tell
now would spoil the fun.

For movie buffs and their
dates unable to break the tube
room habit, five movies will be
shown: ‘Foreign Legion,”
“The Mummy’s Ghost,” ‘Pink
Sphinx,”’ ‘‘Lad and his Lamp,”’
and ‘Prince Violent.’’ Dunnam
said there were no old Rudolph
Valentino movies available,
‘“‘And the Cleopatra movies are
too long, “‘he added.

Who’s going to clean up after
all the partying is done? ‘‘The
two janitors who work in the
Student Center usually have it

all cleaned up by Saturday mor-
ning,” said Dunnam. Assistant
Dining Hall manager Burr Datz
said a crew of workers has been
hired to clean up the mess there
on Saturday morning.

Chamber Players excel

by Robert Boardman Tremblay

The avante-garde Theater
Chamber Players put on a con-
cert Tuesday night that should
not have been missed, not just
because of the great music and
fine performing (there certain-
ly was plenty of that), but
because of a chance to hear the
funniest piece I’ve ever heard.
The composition I’m referring
to is Gyorgy Ligeti’sNouvelles
Aventures, and what an
“ad“aventure’’ it is! Of course,
the piece contains the tradi-
tional man-playing-inside-of-
the-piano routine plus nonsense
syllables and other weird
musical noises, but what truly
turns this work into an ensem-
ble of hysterics are the per-
formanes of soprano Phyllis
Bryn-Julson, mezzo-soprano
Rose Taylor, and baritone
Richard Frisch. Their acting
(remember their name is the
Theater Chamber Players) was
priceless, from stares that
could kill to fits of laughter and
crying, it was all marvelous not
to mention their fine overall
singing as well. Other
highlights of this classic tour-
de-force were the beating of a
rug, the ripping of newspaper,
the rattling of marbles, and for
that subtle touch, the smashing
of a tray of dishes and glasses.

Just beautiful, but there was.

The Theater Chamber

The Flower Center on Main
Street has been supplying cor-
sages for the past 25 years, and
manager Guy Mahoney has
noticed changing trends in their
popularity.

“There has been a recent
boom of buying corsages for
dates. Last year we sold over
500 and this year we hope to sell
more.”

Huffman’s Florist is new, and
already they have more than
100 corsages ordered for the

Friday night dance. The
average price for a corsage at
Huffman’s is $6.50, so with a lit-
tle simple arithematic it’s plain
to see that it will be a good
weekend for them.

selection of articulate adjective
one could use to describe this
film, the only one applicable is
‘‘disappointing.”’

Burt Reynolds and Kris

(which is very much like the
Miami Dolphins in history).
Robert Preston portrays the
team’s owner with Jill
Clayburgh his alluring

with Burt and Kris. A lot of sex.

Wrong.

The sec, contrary to the
poster in the front of the
theater, is non-existent. Even
suggestiveness is minimal.
There are only sporadic oc-
curances of football action
scenes. Any good jokes and
gags come few and far between,
and even a spoof on ESP, at the
end of the film, misses its mark,
as the audience is left only grin-
ning (or sleeping). The acting is
OK. So is the direction. In fact,
even the photography is OK.
However, that’s the problem.
Everything is just a plain, bor-
ing’ disappointing “OK.” You

The film, which will obviously
be based on the album by the
Beatles, will star the Bee Gees
and Peter Frampton. In addi-
tion, Aerosmith, Alice Cooper,
Eath, Wind and Fire, Billy
Preston and George Burns will
be tabled guest stars with Steve
Martin (who will be playing Dr.
Maxwell Edison).

ELO

Musical Mainstream

by Mark Mainwaring
Associate Music Director
WLUR-FM
Out of the Blue
Electric Light Orchestra
United Artists ITLA-823-L2

I’ve listened to it half a dozen
times, and I still can’t figure out
why I like this album. ELO
hasn’t really done anything new
or innovative since their classic
Eldorado, and Out of the Blue is
no exception. Jeff Lynne is still
“borrowing” a lot of his
melodic riffs and vocal styles
from other bands, especially
the Beatles — so much so on this
album that he should be sending
half his royalties to Lennon and
McCartney. ELO’s so-called
“classical rock” is really
nothing more than rock and roll
with strings, not any real in-
tegration of classical and rock
music.

The fact remains that since
its inception, the Electric Light
Orchestra has been turning out
some of the best pop and com-
mercial rock to be found.
Lushly produced and or-
chestrated,Out of the Blue con-
tinues in this tradition of ex-
cellence. ‘Turn to Stone’”’ is the
band’s best single since ‘‘Can’t
Get It Out of My Head,” and
side three’s ‘“‘Concerto for a
Rainy Day” flows together in a
manner reminiscent of the
previously mentionedEldorado
(for you trivia fans, the
thunderstorms heard on this
side of the record were record-

ed simply by hanging a
microphone out of the studio
window). This album is very
commercial, right down to the

kidding!), but recommended
nonetheless.

Former guitarist for the

has more of a disco-funk feeling
(but still retains a basically jazz
and Jazz-rock sound). Though
an excellent guitar player, Ak-
kerman doesn’t use his talents
to their fullest on this record,
and adds too much instrumen-
tal and background ‘‘filler’”’ in
the slow spots. A decent record
(with a great cover!), but one
would expect more from a man
with Akkerman’s capabilities

Room decorations give rubble look

By Ned McDonnell

Psychologists the world over
have often claimed that room
decorations are truly indicative
of the inner and many times
hidden characteristics and ten-
sions of the individual dweller.
At the behest of its social
responsibilities, this reporter,
on behalf of the Ring-tum Phi
staff, has been vested with the
solemn duty of informing the
W&L community what posters
and other paraphenalia and
what different modes of room
decoration reflect about a per-
son . After all, girls who are in
the early stages of a dating rela-
tionship will use what’s in the
room as much as their date’s

actions: to gain, or’ to Solidify, »,

the first and most crucial im-
pressions of a W&L man.

While the style of interior
decoration helps in giving a
general overview of the
dweller’s personality, in-
dividual items connote more
specific aspects of the person’s
character. The ten most com-
mon room decorations and what
they imply psycholica lly are:

A) A Confederate Flag: If a
southerner owns a rebel flag, he
is either a twentieth century
Rhett Butler with an identity
crisis due to the loss of the last
great war or a frivolous carpet-
bagger using it as an agent for
social authenticity. If a nor-
therner: usually residual
dough-face carried over from

. the days.of Franklin Pieree.: - - ---

B) Farrah Faweett Poster :
One of three possibilities: a
teenager plagued with a freu-
dian oral complex, a malleable
pawn of the mass media
culture, or a ninety-seven pound
weakling trying to convince
himself that somewhere,
somehow he has a small grain
of machismo.

C) A picture of the dweller
above desk: Most probably an
apathetic egomaniac who
prefe's gocking at himself in-
stead of involving himself in
such mundane activities as
homework. Usually has a 2.0
average at best.

D) Football poster,pennant,
etc.: A frustrated jock whose
proclivity toward beer con-

or three steps). The playing by
Miss Koston and the singing by
Miss Bryn-Julson were precise

and enjoyable.
The Pattita in D Minor
(including the famous

Chaconne) by J. S. Bach follow-
ed as a nice transition. Miss
Carmirelli was the violinist
again and she was nothing less
than superb in her performance
of this technical workhouse.
Tricky doublestops abound as
does complicated polyphonic
weaving, but all were handled
with seeming ease by Miss Car-
mirelli. The Chaconne might
have been played without all the
repeats, but what it added in
length to some, added enjoy-
ment to others. (In the Baroque
Period, liberties were taken in
such matters as repatts so its

debatable which method of.

playing is correct. )

After the intermission, the
euphonic sounds of Boccherini
took over with the exquisite
playing of his Quintet in D. Ma-
jor. Miss Carmirelli, 1st
violinist, Hyo Kang, second
violinist, Masao Kawasaki,
violinist, Hakuro Mori, cellist,
and David Starobin, guitarist,
performed this delightful piece
with the vitality and feeling that
Boccherini no doubt intended.
As far as form is concerned,
Boccherini is not going to rival
his contemporary Beethoven in
experimentation (for example,
this work’s development sec-
tions are fairly standard and
the recapitulations are also
predictable), but his manipula-

tion of the various instruments
in this ensemble is masterful.
Some beautiful harmonics on
the cello, strings played colegno
(with the wood of the bow), and
a lively fandango at the end
with castenet-like accompani-
ment provided by the cellist and
the guitarist all added up to a
truly exciting performance.

The final piece on this varied
program was, of course, the
aforementioned Ligeti
Nouvelles Aventures, but I
could not close this review
without giving kudos to contra-
bassist Frank Carnovale, whose
frantic playing in one section
was certainly memorable, to
Robert Sheldon, who was for-
tunate enjoy to play his horn in-
to a bottle, to Albert Merz, the
percussionist who played on
almost everything imaginable
from balloons to marbles’ to
Donald Sutherland, who played.
the harpsichord as well as the
inside of the piano, and finally
to the conductor, Leon Fleisher,
who held this challenging piece
together from the start. Con-
ducing these episodes may
seem easy, but they are not, it
takes exact timing among other
talents and Mr. Fleisher has
them all.

A special word of praise, in
closing, should go to the direc-
tors of the Theater Chamber
Players, Leon Fleisher and
Dina Koston. Their troupe gave
a great performance Tuesday
night, musically and theatrical-
ly. It was indeed a concert
worth attending. Those who
didn’t missed a great time.

E) Foreign flag, Posters of
foreign cities, etc.: Undoubted-
ly a person who feels un-
sophisticated, ‘wet behind the
ears’, etc. As a result of these
feelings of inadequacy, he is
trying to act cosmopolitan and
impress others with how in-
credibly exotic this unique men-
tal eunuch must be.

F) The Stars and Stripes:
Either a jingoist with strong
feelings against the Panama
Canal Treaties, an enlightened
southerner, or a budding philan-
thropist who feels like an
altruist for buying American
flags made by blind people.

G) A N.O.R.M.L. poster: an
indulger in contraband who
tries to justify his living in sin
by hopefully lending an aura of
morally democratic sanctity to
it.

H) A prep school pennant:
Sometimes an_ ostentatious
preppy who feels deep down in-
side that he may have nothing
better to offer, (with the posii-
ble exception of cuffed pants or
a silk tie).

I) Live plants, Sierra Club

a disciple of Rousseau. But girls
beware: not all happy savages
have been virtuous when the

These proposals were the
result of various draftings and

types are mostly lazy, com-
atose, disconnected from reali-
ty. They are also brilliant
because they have managed to
devise a ‘general
miscellaneous”’ clothes filing
system which only they can
understand.

Tijuana Tacky: Usually a
superficial person who is a pro-
duct of nouveau-riche breeding.
Classically overindulged with
the best of everything but not
knowing how to use_ those
things, compulsive, and
generally menacing to any liv-
ing thing within ten feet of him.
Of course, the room decorations
will clash.

C) The All-American prep
look: Moderately neat room
usually with a lacrosse stick,
squash, and tennis racket in
prominent view. One finds
many times a pennant or two on
the wall, a football on the bed,
and a baseball mitt on the desk.
Upon walking into such a room,
every young lady should be on
her very best guard for,
although their date may be in-
nocent looking and clean cut,
like the all-american boy, he
may go for every first down that
he can get.

ficient arrangement;but as
sterile as a clinic. There are, for
sure, no posters of any kind on

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

EC: Watchdog
or Watcher?

One may wonder if the student body of Washington
and Lee actually has a representative body. The Ex-
ecutive Committee, in failing to suggest specific
changes in Student Control procedure to the Student
Affairs Committee, has not fulfilled its duty to the stu-
dent body. In the words of Tom Healy, senior law
representative, ‘‘I don’t think the E.C. should attempt
to tell SAC what to do.”’ If the E.C. won’t tell SAC what
to do concerning students’ interests, students should
begin to question the realism of student government
at W&L.

Technically, the E.C. has no power over the Student
Control Committee or its procedures besides appoint-
ment and removal of SCC members. SAC does have
this power. It is with SAC that students must deal to
ensure fair treatment in the future by Student Con-

trol. The procedures Student Control follows do not

take into account the basic rights of students. In fact,
students have unknowingly left themselves open to
search, arrest, indictment and trial in the past.

Student Control meetings are closed and secret,
supposedly for the protection of the accused. Without
being warned of possible legal consequences, an ac-
cused student is compelled to admit guilt or innocence
at an SCC hearing. What SAC and SCC members have
failed to realize and what students are not made
aware of is that no privilege exists between SCC
members and an accused student. The accused’s con-
fession to a third person (the SCC) may indicate pro-
bable cause for arrest or for a grand jury to indict the
accused. If the accused should go to trial, an SCC
member could be compelled to testify against him
under threat of criminal or civil contempt of court. A
confession obtained by the SCC may be used as
evidence at a criminal trial of an accused student.

After Monday’s EC meeting, it is evident that
students’ rights have not been taken into account dur-
ing SCC proceedings. After reading the SCC’s pro-
cedural guidelines it is also evident that no provisions
have been made for the accused’s rights. Finally, it is
evident our EC is on the surface very attractive, but
below the surface irresponsible and _ without
backbone. The EC should have sent a strongly worded
proposal to SAC recommending changes in SCC pro-
cedure that would take into account the rights of the
accused, with special emphasis put on the accused’s
Miranda rights.

In Miranda v. Arizona (1966), the U. S. Supreme
Court extended the Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination to custodial interrogation.
Television has provided familiarity with these rights.

Responses to editorial outcry

Dear Editor,

Some things in life are in-
evitable, death, taxes, and be-
ing harrangued by the editor of
Ariel. Perhaps my pleas will be
somewhat more pleasant than
the other two, I know it serves'a
more worthwhile end.

As per usual in the beginning
of a contribution period I am
scrambling, looking for places
to print in Ariel. As I hope was
demonstrated by the first issue,
there is no set standard for
which I am searching other
than for the nebulous ideal,
literary quality.

It matters not what is written
about, or how it is written
about, so long as it is written
well. This statement is not
meant to scare anyone away,

there are many of you out there ©

capable of writing well in a
number of different forms,
witness Ariel I. I simply wish to
emphasize the wide range of
kinds of pieces I would like to in-
clude in Ariel.

As far as specifics go, I am
looking at at least 32, perhaps 36
pages. That is to suggest that I

be turned over to the EC.

An EC genuinely concerned with representing the
student body to its best ability and not with fear of ruf-

faculty would have suggested changes such as these.
Students should demand these rights when they are
confronted by the SCC, and should demand better
representation from the EC.

make one final request.
Recognizing as I must, the
fact that ‘‘Poems should be as
universal as possible or they

axiom that ‘‘a_ literary

own article

Dear Editor:

I will be teaching a film
course in the English Depart-
ment this spring, and I was
therefore especially ap-
preciative of the opportunity to
review “Saturday Night Fever”
in the last issue of the paper.
Anything you can do to enhance
serious student interest in what
is arguably the great art form
of our century-film-is perform-
ing a valuable and praise-
worthy service.

It is precisely on this ground,
however, that I have some

reservations about The Ring-

tum Phi’s handling of my
review. I would have thought
that a major aim of the paper

I was disturbed, therefore, by
the decision to title my article
“Disco and ERA, a ‘feverish’
combination.” Fewer students
are likely to read an article that
sounds, from the title, as though
it is about feminist politics than
will read an article that is clear-
ly about ‘Saturday Nigh
Fever.’ I discussed certain
large cultural issues which
emerged from the film’s plot,
images, and ambivalences.
That is, I thought of myself as
writing a movie review, not a
brief for the National Organiza-
tion for Women, and it was
reductive and self-defeating to
imply otherwise in the title.

Another self-defeating aspect
of the way in which the paper
handled the review was the
failure to identify me as a facul-
ty member. If this information
had been printed in a by-line
under my name, as is done by
many school papers in similar
circumstances, and as I unders-
tand was done by this paper
other years, it would not only,
perhaps, have enlarged the
readership for the article, but
also have increased the
dialogue on this campus bet-
ween faculty and students. As it
is now, very few faculty
members contribute to the stu-
dent paper, a trend which I
presume it would be valuable to
reverse.

More Letters

To the editor of the Ring-tum
Phi:

In your newspaper’s editorial
last week, and by way of im-
plication in the news article on
which it was in part based, you
assert that there seems to exist
some correlation between this
year’s mid-season decline in ap-
plications, on the one hand, and
data from previous years in-
dicating that many students
whom W&L accepted wished
that the University were
coeducational, on the other
hand.

The logic is spurious.

Your article purports to ex-
amine factors which may in-
fluence students to apply for ad-
mission or which may
discourage them from applying
for admission.

The fact, however, is: The —

University has never under-
taken a survey of applicants,
and there exists no data about
those influences.

The only surveys ever under-
taken in the admissions field
have been among students who
have been accepted and come to
W&L and those who have been
accepted and go elsewhere.
Neither of those surveys has
ever asked which of the Univer-
sity’s characteristics influenc-
ed them to apply in the first
place.

I wish there were such

surveys; my own livelihood
depends in_ considerable
measure, after all, on
Washington and Lee’s success
in attracting highly qualified
students who ultimately enroll
as students.

It is the height of intellectual
shallowness (if you will permit
the metaphorical contradiction,
if you recognize it) to ask
thoughtful people to conclude —
even before all the quantitative
data are in (much less the
qualitative data) — that a
characteristic which has re-
mained static can explain a
dramatic statistical
aberration— especially when it
occurs simultaneously with a
mind-boggling new variable
such as the infamous essay.
(Perhaps the Ring-tum Phi
might more usefully inquire in-
to why we have as many ap-
plications as we do, considering
this formidable new obstacle we
have placed in the paths of our
applicants — practically the
equivalent of requiring a term
paper which we then charge $15
to grade.)

Your implicit assumption
that sheer numbers of applica-
tions is what we seek is, at the
outset, disturbing. We boast, in
fact, that “the admissions pro-
cess at Washington and Lee is

   

 

SUPPLY STORE

not a numbers game.” (The

quote is from admissions
literature sent both to
secondary-school guidance

counselors since 1974 and to
every freshman applicant since
1975.) Quality — and em-
phatically not mere numbers
for numbers’ sake — has been
the University’s aim for as long
as I can remember. We were no
less non-coeducational when
you enrolled, after all, than we
are today.

As matters stand now, of
course, the jury is still out; the
admissions professionals —
much less the student press —
have no way of knowing
whether Washington and Lee’s
experiment with the essay will
succeed. The possibility exists
that you are right. But if you
are, it is coincidence, not
science. The data do not yet ex-
ist to tell.

The fact that I have focused
on only one part of the Ring-tum
Phi’s illogic should in no
measure be taken as an indica-
tion that any of the other data
presented can be regarded as
accurate. Whoever told you, for
instance, that “W&L’s SAT
scores over the past 10 years
have dropped by 70 points while
the nation’s have dropped by 50
points” is a liar or a fool or an
employee of Hampden-Sydney,
or maybe all of the above. The
professor you quote as having
announced that applications
were down by 56 percent has an-
nounced that you got his state-
ment exactly backwards, and
your own front-page figures
back him up. And if you think
coeducation brings about some
automatic improvement in
either the number or caliber of
applicants, you should check —
as the University has — with
some of the colleges which went
coeducational when it was so
fashionalbe a few years ago; a
number of them will confess to
you that, after all, it has not
turned out to be the admissions
panacea they hoped it would be.

Please be aware that these
comments are mine alone and
have not been checked with,
much less approved by, any
other person connected with the
University administration (nor
did I seek such endorsement).

Is It Really Our Gym?

Ken Mastrilli
RtP Sports Commentary

Having failed dismally in my
plans to become a college
basketball star like W&L’s Pat
Dennis or VMI’s Ron Carter,
my basketball heroics have
been limited to times when I
can make it over to the new
gym to play a quick pick-up
game of ‘“‘hoops’’.

Like myself, many students
at W&L can only make it to t
the Warner Center, commonly
known as the new gym, at night.
Why can I (or other students)
only seem to use the gym at
nights? A number of reasons,
quite simply.

In the morning there are
physical education classes,
also, most students have
classes and who wants to play
basketball, or anything else, at
8:00 a.m. In the afternoon there
is usually basketball practice
beginning around 3:30 p.m.
That means everyone gets kick-
ed out around 3:00. '

This manuever — shoves
everyone into the old gym
where one encounters maybe
200 people playing on a floor
built for 30.

At other times one finds the
new gym filled with baseball
players preparing for the fall
season, Some coaches in the
athletic department have decid-
ed that getting practices started
as early in the year as possible
is beneficial, but I have never
seen an indoor baseball game
played on a basketball court
and the logic of practicing on
one escapes me.

Trying to avoid this mass con-
fusion, students come to the
gym at night. But many times
this year they’ve been thwarted
by hundreds of cheering, yelling

and tobacco chewing tans ex-
horting their basketball or
wrestling team to victory in one
of the numerous local high
school tournaments held at the
Warner Center. Also, the gym is
used to conduct various sports
clinics for the Rockbridge area.

Is the Warner Center, built
for students by funds donated
from a private individual to
private institutions, turning into
a local sports arena in the in-
terest of community service

and furthering the growth of

W&L-Lexington relations.

That’s what the athletic
department says. They also
receive a fee for renting the
gym. I wonder if Mr. Warner
knows the center in his honor,
built in the hopes that W&L var-
sity as well as student athletics
would prosper, is being rented
out on a regular basis?

Athletic Director Bill
McHenry has said that the state
of Virginia has asked all univer-
sities and colleges in the state to
cooperate in improving local
relations by sponsoring such
events as high school clinics
and tournaments.

The Pioneer District Basket-
ball tournament held here this
week is a good case in point. It
has prevented students from us-

ing the gym on three con-
secutive evenings this week.
Why not use the old gym?
Because the soccer team holds
two-hour practices there on
several nights during the week.
Who wants to wait two hours.
Most get fed-up and leave.

Students need a place to work
off the tensions that a day of
classes can build up inside the
body, especially in the winter
when outside physical activity
is limited to those willing to
brave 20 degree temperatures.
Excepting rain, nice weather
during fall and_ spring
somewhat alleviates crowding
the gym.

But some students say there
is no need for the soccer team to
practice inside. Considering the
soccer teams’ record in harsh
weather conditions, one
wonders how much inside prac-
tice helps.

Another question. Why don’t
these high schools play their
games in their own gyms?
Because they know we have a
nice facility that can hold a lot
of people. That’s why. At the
present rate, however, it won’t
remain nice very long.

Does the school really need
the money? I doubt it. But as
long as no one says anything,
nothing will happen.

Law center head

Fred Kirgis

A leading international law
authority, Frederic L. Kirgis
Jr., has been named the first
director of Washington and Lee
University’s Frances Lewis
Law Center.

According to a description ot
its purpose adopted by the W&L
law faculty, the Frances Lewis
Center will examine legal doc-
trines and institutions in the
context of pertinent social
values and attitudes, with the
goal of formulating ‘‘ap-
propriate responses regarding
the objectives to be sought” and
specific proposals for achieving
those objectives.

The law center is designed to
function in support of W&L’s
law faculty and students both
inside and outside the formal
law-school curriculum. W&L
faculty may be able to take sab-
baticals to work full-time on
law-center research projects;
there may be research pro-,
grams for students and summer
research opportunities for
faculty members. Visiting
scholars may be brought to the
law center in residence for a
semester or academic year or
for the summer; there may be
visiting attorneys’ and visiting
judges’ programs as_ well.
Special-topic seminars and con-
ferences will also be conducted
under the sponsorship of the law
center.

Kirgis is currently professor

of law at the University of
California at Los Angeles,
where he has taught since 1973.
He was visiting professor of law
at W&L last autumn. He
assumes his new duties at
Washington and Lee Aug. 1, ac-
cording to Roy L. Steinheimer
Jr., dean of the W&L School of
Law, who announced Kirgis’ ap-
pointment.

The Frances Lewis Law
Center was established through
a $2-million endowment in 1972
from Frances and Sydney
Lewis of Richmond. Mr. and

Mrs. Lewis gave $9 million in all
to Washington and Lee’s law
program, $7 million of which

named

university’s new law building,
named for them.

He is the author of ‘“‘Interna-
tional Organizations in Their
Legal Setting: Documents,
Comments and Questions,”’
published last year, and is cur-
rently working on a book on in-
ternational consultation,
scheduled for publication next
year. Kirgis has also written a
number of articles for law
reviews and other law journals.
He is a member of the executive
council of the American Society
of International Law and is ad-
mitted to practice before the
bars of California and the
District of Columbia.

Unlike many law centers, the
Frances Lewis Law Center will
not be limited to work in any
particular field but will focus on
developing knowledge ‘‘at the
frontiers of the law.”

Kirgis received his
undergraduate education at
Yale University and his law
degree from Berkeley. He was
an associate in the Washington,
D.C., law firm of Covington &
Burling, specializing in interna-
tional claims, prior to entering
teaching. He was a member of
the law faculty at the Universi-
ty of Colorado from 1967 until he
joined the UCLA law faculty
seven years later, and spent a
year’s leave of absence in
research study at the London
School of Economics.

Almost too late

There is not much time left to
buy a W&L Glee Club raffle
ticket for a trip to Mexico. The

McNider grilled on SCC

(continued from page 1)

heard by the full committee.
MeNider said about 98 percent
of the cases reported to the SCC
have come before the full com-
mittee.

Healy maintained that any
preliminary investigation
should be on a small scale to
minimize the committee’s time
expenditure and to ensure
fairness and impartiality.

The issue of preliminary in-
vestigations was an important
subject to the E.C. because of
the nature in which they have
been conducted this yeaV. It
came to light that McNider had
carried out the preliminary in-
vestigations of most SCC cases
by himself.

When making inquiries, it
was charged that McNider had
not told the accused: of his
rights. The chairman admitted
that he had not told those he had
investigated that they had the
right to say nothing. Three
honor vioiations have been
referred to the E.C. this year by
McNider. All were SCC cases
that he had investigated, but
which had not been heard by the
full committee. The E.C. voted
to hear two of the cases.

Document Altered

The preliminary investiga-
tion matter was also a part of a
controversy involving the SCC’s
‘Statement of the Purpose and
Procedures of the Student Con-
trol Committee.’’ The Ring-tum
Phi made available to the E. C.

copies of two different SCC

“‘statements.”’

The originally accepted pro-
cedure, dated September, 1977,
had specified that a complaint
of study misconduct would re-
quire a ‘‘majority vote of those
Committee members present”
to determine whether the SCC
would consider the complaint.
After describing the voting re-
quirements, the original state-
ment reads: ‘Upon a deter-
mination in favor of considera-
tion, the Committee shall
undertake sufficient investiga-

tion, including examination of_.

the student complained of, to
make a finding on the com-
plaint.”

Sometime in September,
McNider changed the pro-

DOUBLE TAKE BOOKS

cedure to read: ‘Upon receiv-
ing a complaint of alleged stu-
dent misconduct, the Chair-
man, or his appointed represen-
tative may undertake sufficient
investigation as is warranted. If
misconduct is indicated, a
member of the Committee shall
notify the student to appear
before the Committee at a
specified time. At that time the
Committee shall determine
whether to consider the com-
plaint.”” This revision was also
dated September, 1977.

Members of Student Control
said they had been unaware of
the change in procedure.

MeNider defended the change
by saying that, as far as he
knew, the chairman of Student
Control had always conduoted a
preliminary investigation of the
case before it was heard by the
committee.

MeNider’s critics have said
that he normally investigates
cases to a greater extert that he
should. E.C. representative
Healy argued that the commit-
tee as a whole should in-
vestigate the circumstances of
each case in the hearing.

MeNider said the procedural
change had been approved by
Dean Lewis John, although
there was some question
whether the Student Affairs

' Committee — the committee

which oversees the workings of
Student Control — had approv-
ed the change.

In an interview with the Ring-
tum Phi,Dean John, chairman
of the Student Affairs Commit-
tee, said that to his knowledge
the change had ‘“‘never been
submitted’’ to the SAC. “It has
not been the procedure for Stu-
dent Control to present their

own procedures for the ap-
proval of Student Affairs. 1°
assume Student Control ap- °
proves its own procedures,”’
Dean John said.

Jackie Boyden asked
MeNider point-black if he had
“ever made a student sign a
confession.”’ The problem ap-
parently arose in the case of a
freshman turned in to Student
Control for smoking marijuana
in the dormitories.

Although MeNider protested
the term ‘“‘confession,’’ he ad-
mitted that in a case last
September he had asked a stu-
dent to sign ‘‘a statement.”’
MeNider explained that there
had been manv contradictions
in the student’s testimony dur-
ing the preliminary investiga-
tion and that he had signed the
statement to verify information’
about the case.

Miss Boyden pointed out the
danger of having a signed ad-
mission of guilt when the act
committed is against state law.

MeNider agreed and said that
signed statements will not be
used the rest of the year by the
SCC.

It was also revealed that
McNider did not inform
students of their rights during
his preliminary investigations
— specifically, their right to not
answer his inquiries.

Jack Bovay, junior E.C.
representative, moved that tne
E.C. send a letter to the Student
Affairs Committee to request
that Student Control draw up ‘‘a
more clearly defined’’ state-
ment of procedures,
“specifically: the preliminary
investigation of a case; rights of
the accused; procedures during
the SCC investigation; and a
procedure for amending this
statement.”

The motion passed
unanimously. Three E.C.
members were absent from the
meeting: Doug Perkins, Mike
Missel, and Chris Gammon.

Other Action

In other action in the Ex-
ecutive Committee meeting:
—The Big Three Election (for
president, vice-president, and
secretary of the E.C.) will be
held March 13. Petitions of
students applying for con-
sideration in those positions are
due March 6.

—The election of class officers
will be held March 27. Petitions

_ for those positions are due

March 20. (The law school will
run its own election. )

—Bill Tucker, chairman of the
Student Activities Board, advis-
ed the E.C. that there will be 30
‘“‘doormen”’ at the Fancy Dress
Ball. He warned that the
decorations and the entire
building will be heavily policed.
—Grant Leister informed the
E.C. that the projected costs’ of
this year’s yearbook will be $810
above what was: originally
budgeted due to added: “‘color
work.” He said the cost could be
covered with the sale of four ad-
ditional pages of advertising.
Leister also said that the Sigma
Society owed the Calyx for two
years of coverage and would not
appear in the yearbook this
year unless _ pay $300 im-
_ Mediately.

Improve Your Reading . . . It’s Easy

con’t . from page 5
STEP 3—USE YOUR EYES
EFFICENTLY

The eyes see printed words
and transmit them to the brain.
They are the key to how well
you read.

Eyes perceive words only
when they stop moving or make
what is called a ‘‘fixation’’.
During the pause, the brain
registers what the eyes have
seen. Depending on your eye
span, you will preceive one, two
or more words in each fixation.
The average college student,
for example, has a span of 1.1
words and makes 4 fixations per
second. By increasing the
number or words your eyes in-
clude in each fixation, you in-
crease your reading speed.

Train your eyes to take in
more than one word at a time.
You can make your eyes fix on
related words, phrases, or short
lines in one brief stop. This
sentence, for example, should
be read in five fixations: ‘‘The
cost of oil/has risen/because
of/limited natural resources/
and increased imports.”

Vocalizing words, even in
your mind, slows down your
eyes. Don’t allow your eyes to
wander backward. Try not to
reread sentences. You will find
that you remember.more if you
can keep moving forward. This
does not mena, of course, that
you cannot review what you
have read.

Many people need glasses to
read well. Blurred words, con-
stantly tired or itching eyes are
singals for an eye examination.
Don’t put it off.

After you have surveyed your
reading habits for weak points,
set the scene for efficient
reading, and begin to work to in-
crease your eye span, there are
three additional steps to more
effective reading.

STEP 4—BROADEN YOUR
VOCABULARY

The person with a good grasp
of words is usually a good
reader and a good student. Your

vocabulary should continue to
grow throughout your lifetime.

Keep a dictionary handy,
whether you are reading for
pleasure or for work. Also use
the glossaries in your tex-
tbooks.

Make a list of new words. Jot
down unfamiliar words. Look
them up, and them make a point
of using them once or twice in
writing or in speech within the
next few days.

STEP 5—ADAPT YOUR
SPEED TO THE MATERIAL

Don’t expect to read
everything at the same rate. A
good reader balances speed
with comprehension.

Adjust your pace to your pur-
pose. You can’t expect to whiz
through a biology chapter at the
same rate you could read a light
novel.

Scan the material first. Form
the habit of glancing quickly at
headlines, chapter headings
and subheads. Look for main
ideas. Then decide which parts
you can skim and which will
need more careful reading.

When reading a text, first
survey the entire book. Look
over the table of contents,
chapter headings, and
subheads. Get an overview of
the author’s objectives by
reading the introduction or
preface.

Studying requires close
reading because you will need
to remember both the main
ideas and supporting details.
Underline major points as you
read. Make margin notes of
ideas that occur to you. After

you finish reading, glance back
over the entire chapter to see if
you grasped the key points.
STEP 6—PRACTICE
REGULARLY

Teading can be a lifelong
pleasure for those who read
with ease. Regular practice will
help you to do so.

Set aside 15 to 30 minutes dai-
ly to practice reading. Start
with fairly easy material and
short articles, such as ones in
Reader’s Digest. Your objec-
tive is to read with understan-
ding at your best speed.

Compare your _ present
reading speed with the follow-
ing averages. The speeds
generally accepted for average
readers are: easy-to-light
material, . 250-350 words per
minute (wpm); medium-to-
diffuclt material 200-250 wpm.

Time yourself for two pages
of easy-to-average material and
then compute your reading
speed. Next, ask yourself some
questions about what you have
just read. If you missed impor-
tant details, your speed was
probably too fast for your pre-
sent reading ability.

Read three or four easy-to-
average articles each day for
two or three weeks. Make
yourself go a little faster, but
not so much that you miss key
points. Record your speed.

Switch to more difficult
material for another two or
three weeks of practice. After
six weeks you should have in-
creased your speed and com-
prehension considerably.

Aim for a speed on easy

material of about 300 wpm. At
that rate, you are doing as well
as the average good reader.

Maintain the habit by reading
at least a half hour a day.

The pleasure and benefits of
reading make it a rewarding
hobby throughout life. You will
be enriched by keeping up with
newspapers, magazines and
books. You will also enjoy more
as your proficiency increases
and will be continually adding
to your knowledge.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, MARCH 2, 1978

EC discusses
Phi article

by Randy Smith

The publication last week of a
student’s name in connection
with his conviction of an honor
violation touched off an intense-
ly heated debate during Mon-
day night’s Executive Commit-
tee meeting.

Jim Underhill, president of
the EC, said he was ‘very
disappointed”’ to read the Ring-
tum Phi’s front page article
which named the individual in
its lead paragraph. He also ex-
pressed disappointment in the
EC member who had given the
newspaper information about
the case.

Underhill took issue with the
assumption that the EC should
enforce its own decisions. He
explained that there is no writ-
ten policy which requires EC to
enforce honor convictions. “‘It is
not our position to walk the per-
son to the bus station,”’ he said.

“‘We expected him to leave,”
Underhill continued. The presi-
dent related that a meeting of
the EC had been scheduled for
last Thursday afternoon to
discuss the individual’s continu-
ing presence on campus, but
had been called off because the
person reportedly had left.

Vice president George Griffin
explained the rational of not
publicly discussing honor cases
as a method of protecting the in-
dividual involved. ‘‘We follow
the assumption not to discuss
the merits of a case’’ should the
accused wish an open trial,
Griffin said. (A public trial is
the appeal mechanism after an
hour convictio conviction.)

When questioned, Underhill
would neither confirm nor deny
that the individual involved had
requested an open tiral.
However, at the end of the
meeting, Underhill said the ar-
ticle should not have been
printed ‘“‘when the case was

about to go open.” No notice of
an open trial was ever posted.

J. Michael Gallagher, editor
of the Ring-tum Phi, argued
that ‘‘the person in question was
being allowed to participate in
University functions. The EC

should enforce its own
policies.”’
“We are not going to police
this campus,’’ Underhill
reiterated.

“Don’t attack this committee
for something it’s not responsi-
ble for,” interjected Jim Davis,
Junior EC representative.

Griffin explained that the EC
has “certain roles to fulfill,”
and escorting persons convicted
of honor violations off campus
is not one of those roles.

Speaking for the newspaper,
Gallagher said theRing-tum Phi
has always cooperated with the
EC.” However, ‘‘since this case
involved a public official who
handled $30,000 of student
funds, and misused the powers
of his office, we decided to
publish the story.”

Law representative Tom Hea-
ly called the publication of the
article a ‘‘gross breach of trust.
This is as big a violation of
students’ rights as I’ve ever
seen in here.”

“It is still not clear if (the EC
has) the jurisdiction to remove
anyone from the campus,”
Underhill concluded. He said he
would seek a ‘“‘policy statement
from the appropriate
officials” — notibly the Publica-
tions Board.

In other action by the Ex-
ecutive Committee:

—TheBig Three Election (for
president, vice president and
secretary of the EC) will be
held March 13. Petitions of
students applying for those

positions must be submitted to
the EC by March 6. 150 names in

Fancy Dress ’78 is a memory

by Galen Trussell

Fancy Dress 1978 is now a.
memory. Images remain of
rented tuxes, wilted coursages,
happy and unhappy dates Rack
or otherwise, cars stuck in the
mud at a grain party, a typical-
ly slanderous Washington Post
article and the Four Tops.

An aspect of Fancy Dress that
few W&L students knew of, or
will remember, were the hours
of planning and labor the SAB
put into the event. The SAB’s
labor was directed primarily by
two individuals, Art Dunnam, a
sophomore, and Jim Foreman,
a senior. Dunnam and Foreman
were the planners, coordinators
and troubleshooters for this

year’s Fancy Dress. Their _

memories of the event are un-
doubtedly different than the
average student.

According to Foreman, this
year’s Fancy Dress was the
best he has been involved with.
Foreman thought preparations
for the ball went much
smoother than in previous

Pub board supports Phi position

by Paul Daugherty

. The University Publications
Board refused to consider a sug-
gestion made by - three
members of the Executive
Committee that the board in-
clude in its constitution a
paragraph stating that all
university publications would
adhere strictly to rules in the
White Book.

The White Book is the hand-
book given to all students and
explains the Honor System at
Washington and Lee.

The decision followed a pro-
posal made by Executive Com-
mittee President Jim Underhill
and Vice-President George

Griffin that a clause be added to-

the Publications Board con-
stitution which would state that

White Book rules be upheld in
all university publications.

The proposal was prompted
by an article in the Feb. 24 issue
of the Ring-tum Ring-tum Phi in
which the name of a
Washington and Lee student
convicted of an honor violation
was published.

The White Book directs that
names of honor trial defendants
be held in strict confidence.

The Publications Board,
which supervises all official
school publications, has no
policy concerning the
publishing of the names of those
who violate the Honor Code, ac-
cording to chairman Ryland
Owen. But both he and other
members of the board said that
the addition of a clause as pro-

posed by Underhill and Griffin
would be meaningless.

Underhill argued that the
Ring-tum Phiarticle “abused
the concept of confidentiality.”’

‘We (the E.C.) don’t think it’s
appropriate that anything about
the Honor Code be published,”
he said.

Both he and Griffin wanted
the addition to the Publication
Board constitution to ‘prevent
another incident of this nature
from happening,’ he said.

Ring-tum Phi Editor J.
Michael Gallagher defended the
paper’s actions by saying that
the intent of the article was to
uphold the Honor System by
detailing to the student body the
ways in which the defendant,

years. He said he could only
remember several minor pro-
blems with the ball in general.

One last minute problem Art
Dunnam remembered was the
need to find a piano for the Duke
Ellington band. He said there
was also a problem with the
coat room in that it was not
large enough to accommodate
all the coats, and was filled by
11. Dunnam also recalled a pro-
blem with a leak in the Univer-
sity Center roof and with
lighting.

Accoring to Foreman, the
Friday night crowd was
relatively well behaved. Less
beer was consummed than had
been expected, only 66 of 90
kegs were drained. Only oen im-
portant item (a chair rumored
to be at the SAE house) was
reported missing.

Both Dunnam and Foreman
said they knew of no incidents
where students were destruc-
tive enough to warrant being
reported to the EC. Both admit-

Security foul-up

 

ted that they had planned for
the smaller decorations to
become souvenirs. Dunnam
said no important decorations
were damanged due to good
work done by bouncers. He did
criticize the bouncers for their
failure to keep people out of
restricted areas.

The major decorations such
as wall hangings and paintings
will be stored by the University.
Foreman acknowledged those
decorations have limited future
use because of their orientation
to a particular theme. However,
he added the SAB plans to rent
some of this year’s decorations
to Lexington High for its prom.

The SAB also had a bar built
to help make serving the beer
easier. The bar will also be
stored by the University and
will be used for Fancy Dress in
coming years. The cost of the
bar was about $580, a price
which Foreman said was about
$1,000 cheaper than a bid by

Fight occurs at concert

by Kenneth Mastrilli

Crowded conditions and lax
security may have cause a fight
at the Four Tops concert Thurs-
day night according to students
involved in the fracus, in which
one student required stitches
after being hit over the head
with an empty bottle.

Jesse Shaver, a sophomore
member of Phi Kappa Sigma
said he had been squating down
to pick something up when
Terry Pollock, an SAE junior,
hit him over the head with an
empty bottle, causing injuries
severe enough to require stit-
ches on his nose and forehead.

Pollock said that during the
concert, Sahver, who Pollock
Says was standing next to him,
kept bumping into Pollock and
spilling beer on him and his

date. Pollock said he asked
Shaver to stop bumping him
and his date, but Shaver just
shook his head no.

“T felt he was bullying me,”’
said Pollock,” and I simply lost
control and hit him with the bot-
tle.” Pollock said he too re-
quired stitches on his thumb
which had been cut by the
broken glass. After leaving the
infirmary Pollock said he went
to the Phi Kappa Sigma house
to have a few beers and when he
says Shaver, who also just
came out of the infirmary, saw
him in the house. Pollock said
after a short argument he left
and hasn’t seen Shaver since.

When asked how he got the
bottle into the gym, Pollock said
no one had checked him coming

Sound of Music to be screened

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor

This weekend, the Student Ac-
tivities Board is bringing to
campus another of its long str-
ing of excellent films this
year,The Sound of Music. The
film will be shown in duPont
Hall Saturday and Sunday
nights at 7:30, with a Sunday
matinee at 2:0-.

“A sensational musical is on
its way to Broadway,” announc-
ed Variety when The Sound of
Music opened for the first time
in 1959, in New Haven. And the
verdict was the same at the
New York opening, the same
year. The musical was the last
of a number of record-breaking
shows by Rodgers andHam-
merstein. This pair had re-
juvenated the American
musical with the opening of
theirOklahoma! in 1943, and the

The Land of Oz

Every year, W&L is treated
to a few excellent, small
theatrical productions —
readings or one-man shows.
Certainly, one of the most am-
bitious in recent years is
scheduled to open this weekend.
This Friday and Saturday,
March 3 & 4, at 8 p.m. in the
Troubadour Theatre, Warren
Mowry will present a one-man
show, Clarence Darrow, based
on a play of the same name by
David F:intels.

The production is a long one
for a one-man show (about 90
minutes), but is a full one, as
befits the subject. Almost

everyone has at least heard of
Clarence Darrow, one of the
keenest legal minds of modern
times. Brilliant, abrasive,
dazzling, he was probably the
closest real-life equivalent of
the fictional barrister.

The play is based on the
lawyer’s recollections, filled
with humor, of his professional
career. Always ready to fight
for the seemingly doomed, his
greatest ‘“‘performance’’ pro-
bably occured in the famous
Scopes ‘‘monkey trial,’ about
the teaching of Darwin’s
theories of evolution in grade
schools. At this point in the

play, Mowry has elected to in-
terject a section from the prize-
winning dramalnherit the
Wind. The part presented will
be the climactic victory scene,
where Darrow trapped the pro-
secutor, William Jennings
Bryan, on the witness stand.
Mowry is presenting the show
as his part of his senior thesis in
acting. No reservations are
necessary for the show, and
there is no ticket charge. All are
welcome, and urged to attend
the showing of a portrait — a
man who is truly one of
America’s ‘‘characters.”’

‘Clarence Darrow”

in Troubadour this weekend

by Seth.Oserin

‘‘Heroes’’ stars Henry
Winkler and Sally Field in a mo-
ition picture that is effective but
siow and hesitant in its com-
munication.

The plot centers around a Viet
Nam vet (Henry Winkler) who
is returned to a Veterans;
hospital (where he has been a
psychiatric patient) after
creating a disturbance at an ar-
my recruiting office. He
manages to escape, after being
given $1000 of his buddies
money for investment into a
worm farm.

The rest of the film deals with
his trek from New York to L.A,
during which he meets Sally
Field on a bus. We are exposed
to various antics and
predicaments caused by
Winkler which eventually in-
volves Miss Field (who is alone
on the bus, trying to find a
reason to marry her fiance the
following Sunday). Henry later
has dreams shatter but realizes
solitude in finding a lasting

relationship with Sally. And she
in him.

It all seems very simple —
and it is. In fact, there is
nothing special about this film.
The director, Jeremy Paul
Kagen, often loses sight of
character relationships and in-
tensity degrees. Scenes which
should be high in intensity often
(but not always) break down
before their peak. The script,
however, is not sharp, and may
be some of the director’s pro-
blem.

Sally Field, who is only now
starting to get some of the
recognition she deserves, has
trouble concentrating
throughout the film. She has ex-
tremely good moments that are
constantly fading in and out of
rather poor attempts at emo-
tion. A good example of this oc-
curs when she calls her fiance
near the end of the film. For
some reason, one gets the im-
pression that Miss Field had her
heart someplace else during the
filming of this picture.

Henry Winkler does a good
job with what he was given.
However, at times it seems as
though he was too cute with his
antics, and too extreme with
emotion (although this could be
the director’s fault.)

It would be easy to write this
film off as a failure, like so
many other critics have done,
but this film had one redeeming
quality.

To an age group that just
missed fighting in the war, the
picture will have a strong im-
pact. It brought out the anguish
caused by the Viet Nam war in
present day terms. Ideas about
past experiences’ relation to

present actions become more —

fully understood, as the viewer
leaves with an understanding of
a person’s pain, along with a
damnation in the subconscious
of the ‘‘glories”’ of war.

‘“‘Heroes”’ is playing through
Tuesday at theLyric. It’s worth
the two bucks. Only the totally
insensitive will leave the
theater without having seen the
movie.

years that followed were filled
with similar victories:
Carousel, The King and I, and
the Pulitzer Prize-winning
South Pacific.

The Sound of Music is based
on the story of Maria vonTrapp,
a convent girl who later mar-
ried the wealthy baron with
seven children. The story builds
to an exciting climax, as it
traces her days in the convent,
her service to the von Trapps as
governess, the subsequent mar-
riage to the baron, and the hor-
ror of Nazi annexation of
Austria in 1938.

The story was a natural one
for the hands of Richard
Rodgers and Oscar Hammers-
tein. Exotic setting, appealing
characters, but with more than
a little human warmth. The
music is of their trademark,
those famous songs which are
integrated perfectly with the
story line, yet are able to stand
alone as popular tunes.

Rodgers and Hammerstein’s
musical productions are
marvels of stagecraft. Perhaps
that is why most of them were
relative failures in their movie
versions for only this film suc-
ceeded as a major boxoffice at-
traction. Filmed on location in

 

Salzburg, Austria, the one show
accused by some of being a bit
shallow on the stage gained a
whole new dimension from the
sweep of the Tyrolean Alps.
Julie Andrews played Maria in
the film and themagnetism of
her performance is_ largely
responsible for its success, a
worthy successor to the original
Broadway performance of
Mary Martin.

The phenomenal success of

the picture at the boxoffice, sur- -

passing even Gone With the
Wind, ensured the survival of
20th Century-Fox in the
troublesome 1960’s. Having
been brought to its knees by the
staggering costs of Elizabeth
Taylor’s Cleopatra, the studio
launched $50 million in other
blockbuster musicals. But the
others failed miserably. THis
ended, unfortunately, any
rivival of interest in lavish
musicals such as those of the
1940’s and 1950’s And put Fox
back in its original state of debt.

So, on this weekend of
recovery after Fancy Dress,
one dollar will buy a ticket to
the biggest money-making
popular success in the years
between Gone With the Wind
and The Godfather...

Those of you who chose to
finish up your Fancy Dress
weekend discoing out at the frat
house missed a prime op-
portunity to see a really great
performer. George Fischoff,
the jazz pianist who thrilled
crowds in the EC room Friday
night, decided to stay in Lex-
ington another night and bang
on his piano again for W&L
students.

Fischoff is a songwriter who
has written such hits as Ninety-
eight Point Six for Keith
and Lazy Day for Spanky and
Our Gang. Also to his own
recording credit, his last four
records have hit the Billboard
top 100. He wrote the score for a
Broadway musical, Georgie
based on the play Georgie Girl .
Georgie unfortunately closed
after five performances. He is
presently working on another
musical based on the James
Michner novel, Sayonara.

It was fun for all as Fischoff
grabbed students from the au-
dience and had them repeatedly
punch a note on the piano while
he composed a piece around it.
He could easily have been a
standup comic, telling jokes
and them inprovising songs to
go along with his stories.
Besides his improvisational
pieces, he played excerpt from
his old hits, his new record

Pit
Piano Picker, and a hoped for
hit which Perry Como will sing,
Everything.

“T’m the only guy around who
writes only piano pieces. I don’t
write lyrics, as I can’t sing.”
Fischoff proved this, but the
crowd still enjoyed hearing him
try. The jazz pianist said, ‘I
like to have fun with music. It
isn’t true entertainment unless
the audience is included.” Well,
Fischoff included the audience
Saturday night, and he had fun
and so did they.

This weekend: Burr Datz and
Friends will appear in the
Cockpit Thursday night. Datz
appeared in the ‘‘Pit’’ last term.
On Friday and Saturday night,
Marty Bear will return to enter-
tain students. Last year, Bear
played in the Cockpit an entire
week. That fact alone is enough
to tell you he is an extraor-

dinary individual.
On next ‘happy hour’’
Wednesday, Willie  Nininger

will mix his own compositions
with songs by John Prine,
Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan,
Jimmy Buffet, and Jackson
Browne. Nininger incorporates
humor and satire into his act,
which gives it his own personal
style. He has been the backup
for such name performers as
Buffet and Steve Goodman.

Thus ends another install-
ment of ‘In your Pit.’’ Will see
you later, in your pit.

W&L’s own Building and
Grounds Department.

Foreman said he knew of only
one person hurt Friday night in
what he described as a very
humorous incident. According
to Foreman, an alumni fell off a
railing while reaching for a
souvenir. The alumni fell on top
of a Sweet Briar girl knocking
her out and sending her to the
hospital for the night.

Foreman and Dunnam also
agreed that the belly dancer
was the crowd;s favorite side
show. The belly dancer was
Jane Newman of Harrisonburg.
Mrs. Newman teaches classes
in belly dancing in Harrison-

burg. The fellow standing
beside her with the sword was
her husband.

Dunnam said he received a
lot of positive feedback concer-
ning the vocalist with the Duke
Ellington band, and about the
band in general. Foreman said
he thought the band was easier
to dance to than last year’s
band which starred Woody Her-
man. Both Dunnam and
Foreman said the crowd en-
joyed the orchestra’s older
tunes more than its more recent
ones.

Attendance at the ball was
lower than last year, due in part
to the limited number of tickets.
Foreman estimated approx-
imately 1,300 tickets were sold
to W&L students, and about 180
were sold to alumni. These
numbers coupled with the facul-
ty who attended, made the totai
attendance figure around 3,000,
according to Foreman.

Foreman was optimistic
about the expense for the event.

He said he didn’t believe the
SAB was going to loose any
money on the event, and that
the SAB might even end up in
the black. In 1976 the ball broke
even and last year it made
about $1,000.

Costs for the various acts Fri-
day night were as follows:
$4,000 for the Duke Ellington
band, not including sound and,
lights; $1,000 to $900 for the
mentalist; $650 for the belly
dancer. Dunnam _ estimated
these costs coupled with the
projected cost of decorations,
building and grounds clean-up’
beer and assorted items totaled
approximately $10,000.

Alumni who attended the
function came mostly from the
class of 1977, followed by the
class of 1975, according to
Foreman. Five alumni couples
from the class of 1936 were also
at the affair.

Sales of the various
paraphenalia associated with
Fancy Dress also went well,
Foreman said. The hottest sell-
ing items were the Fancy Dress
grain cups. The SAB sold 3,000
of the cups in two-and-a-half
days and made about $200 profit
on them. Fancy Dress posters
sold fairly well according to
Dunnam. The posters were be-
ing sold for below cost.

The souvenir coins, handed to
each couple as they entered,
were Dunnam’s idea. The coins
were minted so that the side
featuring the busts of
Washington and Lee could be
used in subsequent years on
other coins.

Interesting enough, both per-

though in obviously different
ways. The reason lies of course
in the strength of Brahm’s com-

such radically different but
equally valid interpretations
proves once again the value of

Generals win NCAA

B-ball playoff berth |

by Mark Mitchell

The Washington and Lee
basketball team wrapped up
their second straight ODAC
crown last weekend by clobber-
ing Bridgewater 108-80 and
defeating Lynchburg 72-65.

Bridgewater had only lost to
the Generals by 4 points, a week
earlier. The Eagles, inspired by
that moral victory, came out
playing with great intensity.
However, the Generals also
came to play and within ten
minutes they had taken control,
as they romped to their 11th
straight victory over
Bridgewater.

In the finals, Washington and
Lee had anything but an easy
time with the talented Lyn-
chburg Hornets. Lynchburg,
playing on their home court,
busted out to an 11-4 lead.

Despite the slow start, the
turning point of the game may
well have been with Collins
blocked E. D. Schechterly’s
first shot. Schechterly, who had
thoroughly dominated
Hampden-Sydney, was much
more reticient to shoot after
that point. In fact, the AIlLODAC
center only took sic shots all
night.

The Generals took most of the
first helf to make up that 7 point
deficit and managed to take a 1
point lead at half-time.

In the second half, Pat Dennis
finally managed to wear down
his vei'y quick and determined
defender (all-ODAC guard
Wayne Davis). Dennis scored
six straight points and the
Generals soon led 51-41.

In a surprise maneuver, Lyn-
chburg reacted to the ten point
deposit by unveiling a half court
press. The - press was
successful—Selinger, the
Hornets point guard, had two

diving steals and Schechterly
had two blocked shots. In addi-
tion, the Generals were being
called for violations they pro-
bably would not have been call-
ed for at home — several block-
ing fouls and a traveling viola-
tion that nullified a possible 3
point play.

Yet Lynchburg could pull no
closer than two points. They
missed 7 of 17 attempts in the
second half, and many of those
misses were on the front end of
one and one situations. W&L,
on the other hand, converted 16
of 19 free throws in the second
half.

Free throw shooting was
vitally important with 10
seconds to go. With ten seconds
left to play, the Generals were
up by only two, but Dennis was
at the line. Dennis sank both
free throws. Lynchburg ran
down the floor, missed a shot,
and immediately fouled Collins.
Collins, who was 6 per 8 from
the line, made the first shot of
the one and one. He missed the
second one, but Leunig, who
had 17 points, rebounded the
ball and put it back up. Thus,
the Generals’ 7 poin margin of
victory is a deceiving statistic.

The win, the team’s 21st of the
year, allows them to go to the
NCAA tournament for the se-
cond straight year. The team is
very optimistic since they have
won 11 of their last 12 games.
Also, they placed some nor-
theastern teams this year in
order to become accustomed to
playing the very quick teams
that New Jersey is noted for
possessing. Thus, when they
play Jersey City this Friday at
Kean College, they should not
be as unprepared as they were
in last year’s NCAA tourna-
ment.

Rogers ODAC wrestler of the year

Wrestlers send 4 to nationals

by Mark Peterson

Ed Rodgers, the 1978 Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
Wrestler of the Year, and six of
his teammates captured in-
dividual championships as the
Wrestling Generals won their
second consecutive ODAC
championship Wednesday even-
ing at Eastern Mennonite. Nine
Generals made it to the finals as
the team maintained its
undefeated career record in the
ODAC, scoring 105.5 points to 78
for second place Lynchburg.
Eastern Mennonite and
Hampton-Sydney brought up
the rear with 27 and 25 points
respectively.

After the team sat out the
finals of the 118 pound division,
Howdy Knipp beban a string of
nine consecutive Generals in
the finals. Knipp, who was a
conference champion three
years ago closed his career on
the same note, registering an
overwhelming 17-4 victory in
the finals after pinning his oppo-
nent in the first round.

Following Mike Deighan’s se-
cond place finish at 134 pounds,
Ray Gross began a run of five
consecutive championships for
Washington and Lee following a
first round pin with a 9-2 verdict
in the finals. The championship
was the second straight for the
talented sophomore, whose
outstanding abilities make him
a good prospect to continue his
ODAC career undefeated in the
next two years. .

Jim Flippen captured the 150
pound crown with a 12-6 win in
the finals. The championship
concluded a strong late season
rush for Flippen, whose per-
formance’ improved greatly
when he dropped down from 158
pounds in January.

Dave Stoeffel became the on-
ly freshman on the squad to
capture first place honors when
he marched through the 158
pound division unscored upon,
registering two pins. Stoeffel,
who wrestled at 167 pounds dur-
ing the regular season, was
moved down for the tournament
to increase his chances for a ti-
tle, Coach Franke’s strategy
proved flawless.

For the second consecutive
year the ODAC’s top wrestler

 

came from W&L as Ed Rodgers
captured the coveted MVP
award won last year by Jim
Crytzer. Rodgers, who won the
title at 150 last year and wrestl-
ed at 158 throughout most of this
year, met the challenge of mov-
ing up to 167 easily, gaining a
bye in the first round before pin-
ning his opponent in the finals
after only 95 seconds of wrestl-
ing.

The most evenly balanced
division in the tournament was
at 177 pounds, where Tom Oxen-
dine won the championship by a
narrow 7-4 score. Oxendine,
who struggled throughout the
early part of the season, match-
ed his brilliant performance in
Boston by earning the teams
sixth individual championship
of the evening.

Following Dan Kniffen’s loss
in the finals of the 190 pound
division, the Generals captured
their seventh individual title of
the meet in the heavy weight
division as Warren Mowry
followed a first round pin with
an 8-1 triumph in the finals.
Mowry, who only began to wres-
tle competitively last year, has

showed phenominal improve-
ment throughout the year, as in-
dicated by his strong per-
formance in the conference
tournament.

Following their ODAC
triumph, the Generals took it on
the chin in a tri-meet with
Madison and American Univer-
sity on Fancy Dress Saturday.
With the conference champion-
ship already behind them and
the National Tournament just
around the corner, the team
gave its most dissappointing
showing of the season falling
toMadison 21-15 and_ to
American by a 24-12 count. The
double loss left the Generals
with a 9-8 record in duel meets
and their second consecutive
undefeated ODAC title.

All that remains now for the
Generals is the NCAA Division
III nationals, to be held this
weekend in Wheaton, Illinois.
The team will be represented by
Howdy Knipp, Ray Gross, Dan
Kniffen and Ed Rodgers who
needs only one win to tie Jim
Crytzer’s season record of 25
victories established last
season.

Winter indoor track team

finishes 3rd in ODAC meet

by Neil Cote

The Washington and Lee in-
door track team finished a dis-
tant third place in the 1978 In-
door Track Championships held
at the Wake Fieldhouse at Lyn-
chburg College on Feb. 25.

Lynchburg College won the
meet win a total of 93 points.

Bridgewater College was se-
cond with 75 points, W&L third
with 37 and Emroy and Henry

~ was fourth with 30.

Lynchburg dominated the
meet, winning seven out of 15
events, and finishing second
five times. Bridgewater won

four, and both W&L and E&M
won two.

W&L’s Phil Dunlay won the
35 pound weight throw for the
second consecutive year with a
40-foot heave.

The Generals’ two-mile relay
team of Richard Bird, Bill Mor-
ris, Bill Welch and Chris Daniel
won their event and set a new
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference record with a time of
8:25.5, beating the 8:34.7 mark
set last year by Lynchburg.

Lynchburg’s Jerry Stroop,
who won the triple jump, the 60-

yard high hurdles and helped
his team win the 440 yard relay,
was chosen ‘‘Performer of the
Year’’ by ODAC coaches.
Stroop’s coach, Aubrey Moon,

was named “Coach of the
Year.”’

Lacrosse: W&L rite
of spring returns

by Neil Cote

W&L lacrosse coach Jack
Emme r will have to solve a pro-
blem before his stickmen start
their season against Duke
University at Durham, N.C.,
this Saturday.

Some time before then, the
former All-American
defenseman from Rudgers will
have to decide whether to start
second-team All American
Charlie Brown or sophomore
Bob Clements, who according to
Emmer did a ‘‘spectacular job”’
last year in goal.

Rival coaches wish they had
Emmer’s problem.

The Generals have similar
“problems” on attack and in
the midfield.

These ‘‘problems,’’ however,
may not be enough to pusy aside
Maryland, Cornell, Johns
Hopkins and other perrenial
lacrosse powers.

Emmer, whose teams have
won 60 of 78 games during his

five years at W&L, concedes
that larger schools that give out
athletic scholarships start the
season with an advantage.

Neither the Generals’
lacrosse team nor Emmer,
however, are about to be
discouraged because W&L, ac-
cording to Emmer, has
something other schools do not.

What W&L has, that other
schools do not, is unparralleled
pride and support from the
students, the faculty and the
local community and this has
helped the Generals win many
games, Emmer said.

“‘We don’t have scholarships
and lazy academic standards
for athletes but we make it work
in our favor,’ the blonde
lacrosse coach said. ‘ The
tremendous enthusiasm we get
from the campus and the com-
munity helps motivate us and
make our job easier.”’

Regardless of how much sup-
port the team gets from the

Glee Club singers

The Washington and Lee Glee
Club will be giving a sneak
preview of what it intends to
perform on its upcoming tour of
Mexico during a concert on
Tuesday, March 7 in Lee Chapel
at8 p.m.

The concert will feature
Hollins’ chorus and a combined
W&L-Hollins rendition of
Haydn’s ‘‘Requiem Mass.”’

W&L’s selection will range
from the beautifully sacrosanct
“Ave Maria,” to an eerily
romantic arrangement of °
“Down in the Valley,”’ to theoff-
key, off-beat “Ballad of Little
Musgrave.” To liven things up,
a variety of black spirituals will
punctuate the evening.

community, Emmer said
players in some positions will
have to get over inexperience
before the Generals can start
thinking of the playoffs.

The main area of concern, ac-
cording to Emmer, is on
defense where the loss of five
lettermen to graduation, in-
cluding All-American Tom
Kiegler, will force the Generals
to go with four relatively un-
proven players, senior Bob
Williams and sophomores Steve
Johnson, Chris Walsh and Scott
McLam, who was converted
from midfield to defense this
year too add more size, strength
and quickness to the back lines.

Emmer’s worries about the
defense, however, are reduced
considerably because of
remarkable depth in goal.

“Goal is our team’s strongest
area, and I honestly believe we
have the best goalie situation in
the country,” Emmer said.

The Generals’ midfield will
be the teams’ second-biggest
advantage, according to Em-
mer. Although losing Jack
Dudley and Doug Fuge to
graduation, the midfield should
be at least as strong as it was
last year. Returning to the
W&L lineup are Jay Sindler,
Mark Derbyshire, Joe Olive,
Roman Kupecky, Sandy
McDonald and Charlie Steiff,
who was second only to Kiegler
with 94 ground balls.

On attack, the Generals have
all their starters back for
another year, with the excep-
tion of Chris Kearney, who
withdrew from the university
last year.

Although Kearney led the

  
   

team in scoring in 1977, Emmer
said he did not expect his
presence to be_ missed.
Kearney, despite his points
scored, was often inconsistant
and made too many mistakes,
Emmer said.

Much of the Generals’ offen-
sive punch should be supplied
by attackmen Johnny Black
and Honorable mention All-
American Jeff Fritz, who com-
bined for 55 goals and 54 assists
last spring. Kearney’s slot
should be filled by one of four
condendors: sophomores Jay
Foster and Rob Eisdorfer or
freshmen Ron Hiltz or Pere
Roberts.

Even if the defense holds up

they are to better last year’s
11-4 record. W&L will face a

REVIEW and OUTLOOK LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry
Government decried Law student condemns EC

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The E.C. had its day in “‘court’’ Tuesday, trying to persuade the
Publications Board to adopt an amendment to its constitution
which would have had the effect of requiring University publica-
tions not to print the names of anyone involved in an honor trial.
The Publications Board, to its everlasting credit, told the E.C. to
get lost.

When Nixon sought to enjoin the publication of the Pentagon
Papers, he invoked the concept of ‘‘national security.’’ The E.C.
chose to invoke the concept of the honor system. In any cloak it
means one thing: Government’s attempt to subvert the First
Amendment. It is censorship, plain and simple.

In normal circumstances, the Ring-tum-Phi does not print the
name of anyone involved in an honor trial. In fact, the Ring-tum-
Phi had learned more than two weeks earlier that the the student in
question had been convicted, but chose to withhold the information
in deference to the honor system. Only after weeks of E.C. inaction
did the Ring-tum-Phi realize something had to be done and the E.C.
was not willing to do it. The student’s continued presence on cam-
pus made a mockery of the honor system the E.C. is sworn to
uphold. When theRing-tum-Phi printed the story, it was with the in-
tent to uphold the honor of the University by spurring the ap-
propriate persons on campus. Action has since been taken.

In studied contrast, the wheels of government seemed to turn
much quicker against the Ring-tum- Phi after it printed the name
of the honor defendent. Three days after the article appeared, the
Ring-tum- Phi editors were treated to a seething attack for their
lack o: moral rectitude. Mike Missal was also attacked for the
guidance he gave the Ring-tum-Phi in the writing of the article.

The :unny thing is that the man responsible for most of the vitriol,
E.C. President Jim Underhill, had talked extensively with the
Ring-tsim-Phi about the honor trial. In fact, he suggested we should
print the whole story if the defendent told him he was going public.
One R:P editor suggested to Underhill that it might preclude the
possibility of a fair trial. Underhill agreed. While Underhill was ad-
mittediv speaking off the record, his attack on Missal borders on
the hypocritical. If E.C. members shouldn’t talk about honor cases,
they sl.ouldn’t talk at all.

However, we believe in this instance that it was beneficial to the
honor system for an E.C. member to be frank. Mike Missal’s
courage should be applauded. He was the only E.C. member to take
a strong stand on the controversy. The E.C.’s attempt to expurgate
its irresponsibility by excoriating Mike Missal and by harassing the
Ring-tum-Phi should be seen as no less than a cover-up for its
failure to carry out the spirit of the honor system.

The «ope for the future is that Jim Underhill will adhere to his
campaign statement made in the March 3, 1977 Ring-tum-Phi:
‘The president’s primary objective must be to maintain the honor
syster. for the Washington and Lee community. I feel that this can
best be accomplished not by rigid adherence to the White Book, but
rather by interpretation of the principle of honor by students
dedicated to objective justice and sensitive to changing attitudes
and vaiues of the W&L community.”

The Ring-tum-Phi agrees completely with this statement. The
Phi and Mike Missal tried to maintain the credibility of the honor
system.

Legitimate issues raised by the Rtp to be considered are: Who is
responsible for seeing a student a student leaves the W&L com-
munity? Dean John says the E.C. The E.C. consitution says the
E.C. The answer—the E.C.Also should the ‘24 hour rule’’ be
reinstated? The rule, rescinded a few years ago, requires anyone
convicted of an honor offense to leave the W&L community within
24 hours. Reinstating the 24 hour rule is appropriate to ostracize an
Lonor offender.

Dear Editor:

I usually prefer to remain a
silent observer of campus
politics, but recent EC action
and particularly the stand
taken by Tom Healy, senior law
representative, require me to
voice my opinion publicly.
Although W&L is not the “real
world,”’ the University with the
Executive Committee serving a
triple function as executive,
legislature, and judiciary does
affect recognizable student
rights through its actions. This
is especially true at an institu-
tion with an honor system which
requires sanctions for viola-
tions of student mores. Here,
the only police force to be con-
tended with is the Student Con-
trol Committee, the only judge
and jury we shall ever have is
the Executive Committee, the
only defense to be gained is the
Law School. and the only
representative of free press
with its idealistic funct-on of
guarding the liberty of the peo-
ple are the Ring-tum Phi and
the Law News.

Unfortunately, the Executive
Committee and the STudent
Control Committee have chosen
to remain different from the
“real world’ in one respect.
Although a person’s natural
rights are often violated in the
real world, the Bill of Rights of-
fers protection. This is especial-
ly true in protection of rights of
persons charged with crimes
and protection of the rights to
free speech and the press. We
can lament the many instances
of violation of these rights, but
we can point, at least, to vin-
dication of these required by
our Constitution. We can go to
the courts and pray for such
vindication, hopefully receiving
our just due. At W&L, I am
ashamed to say, there are very
few rights recognized and of-
fered to students. I was per-
sonally privy to a story of how a
Student Control member ob-
tained a written confession by
devious means from a student
charged with honor violation.
This confession could have been
used against the student in a
“real’’ court, much less the
shoddy tribunal which hears
honor violations on this cam-
pus. I reported this instance to
an EC member hoping for
specific recommendations to
Student Control so that student
rights would have a concrete
basis and would be protected in
the future. Student Control
received a slap-on-the-hand ad-
monition from e EC. No specific
guidelines issued and my own
EC representative, Mr. Healy,
was heard to say ‘I don’t think
we should tell SAC what to do.”’
I ask you now, Mr. Healy, if you
don’t tell SAC what to do, who
shall? I suppose it’s quite

alright not to protect student °

rights in this manner. However,
if you have a smoking habit, I
would advise you for your own
protection to cease. Big Brother
MeNider may be watching you.

The latest EC/Healy atroci-
ty was their attempt to censor
the Ring-tum Phi. Because a
convicted honor felon remained

on campus, selling T-shirts he
was unauthorized to have made
and boasting that he would at-
tend Fancy Dress, honor viola-
tion notwithstanding, thePhi
printed a _ story. which
represented a basic problem of
enforcement with the honor
system. Mike Missal is to be
congratulated on his attempts
to ensure the honor felon’s
departure from the W&L com-
munity. The rest of the EC ap-
parently did nothing. Then they
had the gall to criticize the Phi
for its story and go before the
Publications Board demanding
censorship in matters of honor.
The Ring-tum Phi passed up the
biggest story of this year in not
printing the gory details of an
appointed officials’s nisuse of
his position. In printing a story
only after the convicted honor
felon had publicized his story by
his own actions, the Phi did not
act in contempt of a confidential
honor matter. Mr. Healy should
know that one’s right to privacy
may be diminished by one’s
own actions. The Phi violated
no confidentialities as this in-
dividual had sacrificed any con-
f Jence owning him by his own
outrageous behavior.

Worst of all, the EC decided
by its actions this week that
violating a few student rights is
not enough. Faced with a
newspaper that acted conscien-
tiously in its treatment of an
honor matter, the EC demand-
ed censorship through. the
Publications Board’s adoption
of a new newspaper policy.
True, Mr. Healy, First Amend-
ment rights may not vest legal-
ly in the newspaper of a private
college. -I am _ appalled,
however, that my own student
government and my own
elected representative do not
respect the privilege of free
speech and a free press whether
or not it is legally mandated.
Luckily, the Publications Board
declined the EC’s kind offer to
end free press on the W&L cam-
pus. It is a shame that Rick
Goddard is no longer on the Ex-
ecutive Committee. I propose
we substitute the Publications
Board for our preset present
EC. By their record they have
shown more respect for student
rights.

The

Other
Side

Dear Mr. Editor,

Recent publicity surrounding
the dismissal of a student from
the University for violation of
the Honor System has stirred
considerable discussion about
the right of an accused student
to have his identity and the
facts of his closed hearing held
in strict confidence. ,

- Undoubtedly, the respon-
sibility for the ensuring the con-
fidentiality of honor pro-
ceedings rests primarily with
the members of the Executive
Committee. Regrettably,
several members of the E.C.
failed to adhere to this princi-
ple. Although some information
inevitably leaks out whenever a
student is convicted of an honor
offense--the E.C. does not
operate in a vaccuum--we
recognize that there is an ex-
|press obligation, stated in the
White Book, that mandates
strict confidentiality with
respect to an individual honor
trial.

Unfortunately, the Ring-tum-
Phi feels unconstrained by any
such policy of confidentiality.
At a recent meeting of the
Publications Board, the Board
was asked to clarify its policy
concerning publication of in-
formation relating to specific
honor trials. The response was
that confidentiality will be
observed, except when deemed
‘“‘newsworthy’’. When asked to
consider a resolution that would
affirm the right of an accused
student to have his identity kept
out out of print, the Publications
Board responded with the
predictable litany of prior cen-
sorship and first amendment
priorities.
Board has failed to recognize its
obligation under the Honor
System. .

The editors of the Phi justify
revealing the identity of the stu-
dent in the first sentence of the
front page article as being in-
cidental to the news story about
the student’s continued
presence on campus after his
conviction. Admittedly, the
responsibility for removal of a
convicted student is open to

I would like to answer Ken
fastrilli searing attacks made
gainst the policies of the cer-
ain coahces and in particular
pon the soccer program. Mr.
fastrilli’s negative attitude
nd close mindedness certainly
ieeds to be responded to.

Were Mr. Mastrilli a lacrosse
r baseball coach with a good
ayer of snow outside and
james less than a month away,
vhat would he have his team
lo? The logic of practicing in-
loors in this situation sure
nakes a lot of sense to me.

In regard to soccer, Mr.
Aastrilli shows .a_ great
lisregard for detail. The group
if athletes who play indoor soc-
‘er are a sanctioned club of the
iniversity ; they are not the soc-
‘er team. There is no restric-
ion of membership in the soc-
‘er club; we welcome all in-
erested parites and have many
non-soccer players involved.
3y the way, the soccer players
lid enjoy your note of en-
‘ouragement. Should we even
»other to schedule any op-
yonents for next year?

As a sanctioned club of the
iniversity, we have certain
scheduling privileges. We tried
‘0 avoid causing any conflicts so
we asked for permission to use
the gym at times when there
would be no problems. Instead
of using prime time in the after-
noon, we’ve gone in the evening
when the new gym is left free,
and on Saturday mornings at

Dear Editor,

I am writing not in reference
to any of your previous articles
but on another subject since I
feel this is the only way that this
problem will get publicized.

Forty days ago I broke a light
fixture in Davis dorm and paid
my fine for this offense. The
light fixture has not been
replaced and neither has the
one that was broken in the
month of September. I have
questioned my dorm counselor
on the subject and he can offer
no information on it. But is not
his problem. The fault lies in the
Buildings and Grounds Depart-
ment. Both checks have been
processed for these light fix-
tures, but alas no light fixture
has been replaced. I paid my
money and DEMAND that the
MAINTENCE DEPARTMENT
either refund my money or
replace these fixtures. I wonder

where my money went since it

obviously did not go to the right
place.

Shaver last Friday morning
tried to get a warrant issued
against Pollock according to a
police report, but Rockbridge
County Judge Holstein declined
to issue a warrant because of in-
sufficient evidence.

Pollock was not present, and
has yet to be questioned on the
fight by the SCC, whose chair-
man Jim McNider would issue
no comment.

When asked how he got the
bottle into the gym, Pollock said
no one checked him when he
came through the gym door. He
was one of many students who
managed to get bottles into the
gym as observed by the Phi,
mainly due to an apparent
misunderstanding between the
SAB and IFC.

IFC president Steve Mattesky
and SAB chairman Bill Tucker
both blame each other for not
having adequate security to
stop students from bringing li-
quor into the gym. Mattesky
said the SAB did not help mat-
ters by having Coca-Cola serv-
ed outside the gym, because the
soft drink is often used for mix-
ing liquor.

The security gaffe goes back
to December when SAB chair-
man Bill Tucker told IFC that
the only way there could be a
concert was if someone else
could be brought in to help set-
upequipment for the band and
provide security at all en-
trances. He asked the IFC to
provide the manpower.

Tucker said in December he
asked Mattesky if he could
organize the needed manpower
because it would be difficult for
SAB members to get the Stu-
dent Center ready for Fancy
Dress and work at the concert
at the same time. Mattesky said
the misunderstanding came
when he thought he had made it
clear to Tucker that working
the concert should be a joint ef-
fort by the IFC and the SAB.

‘Both sides thought they had
an agreement, but apparently
neither understood what the
other side needed according to
their statements. Mattesky said
the big blow to getting security
people for the concert came
when the SAB put up posters
saying that the concert was free
to all students. ‘‘This took away
the incentive that anyone would
have. for wanting to work
security at the concert,’ said
Mattesky, “because why would
anyone want to put up with the
responsibility of working at a
concert to save money, when he

can go for free.’’ Mattesky said
he informed Tucker of this pro-
blem when the SAB chairman
came to an IFC meeting the
Tuesday before Fancy Dress
weekend. Tucker had gone to
the meeting to see what ar-
rangements had been made to
that point, and was distressed
when he learned that no ar-
rangements had yet been made,
because of athletic department
pressure to prepare security for
the concert.

Mattesky told Tucker it would
be difficult to get students to
work for nothing and advised
Tucker that he could probably
get 10 students or so to work for
$5 a piece. Tucker, according to
Matteksy, told the IFC if it
wanted to pay the people that
would be fine. But according to
Tucker, Mattesky told Tucker
that since the concert was an
SAB function and the SAB
should pay for its own security
personnel. Tucker told the Phi
that since the IFC took on the
responsibility of getting the peo-
ple then they should have to
“follow through’’. ‘‘I was temp-
ted to hire the people myself,”’
said Tucker, ‘‘and then send the
IFC the bill, but I never did.”’

Mattesky said he thought he
gave Tucker the impression
that if money was not supplied
by the SAB for security, then
there would not be any. Tucker
left the Tuesday ngiht meeting
he said feeling that the IFC was
still responsible for getting the
needed people.

When Thursday night rolled
around, so to speak, there was
no security. In fact, according
to Tucker, there was no one to
help the band set up or unload
equipment.

Tucker said he had to get
Coach Miller to hire three men
at $20 a piece to work at the gym
entrances. Mattesky eventually
did show up, with his friend Ed
Burgess, but no else, said
Tucker.

Mattesky said that Tucker
could have taken his suggestion
to hire 10 students at $5 a piece
and saved money. Tucker said
he and the rest of the SAB voted
down Mattesky’s suggestion
because tbey felt since the IFC
had originally taken the respon-
sibility they should have to
follow through.

“The SAB get free admission

to Fancy dress and SAB films
along with other events,” said
Mattesky, “‘they have a lot of in-
centive, but who wants to work
for nothing.”’ Mattesky added,
‘Tucker is just not a man of his
word.’’ Tucker did not comment
on the statement but asked the
question as to how long or how
much the IFC worked on getting
security people at the concert,
leaving doubt as to whether
they had done any work at all.

“We had to work all night
Thursday and late on Friday to
get Fancy Dress ready,”’ and
SAB member Ton McCarthy,
“the IFC agreed to get security
and didn’t get off their duffs and
follow through.”’

Tucker said the SAB was not
legally responsible for the inci-
dent which occurred at the con-
cert last Thursday night, ad-
ding if any liquor got into the
gym it was the responsibility of
Assistant Athletic Director
Dick Miller and his men.

Charlie Hulfish, abused the
Honor Code.

“The Ring-tum Phi staff felt
that Hulfish made a mockery of
the Honer System by hanging
around,” he said. Gallagher
said that he felt it necessary
that the student body be aware
of Hulfish’s actions.

In other business, Gallagher’s
request that Phi staff members
Lee Howard and Jim Barnes be
reimbursed by the Publications
Board for financing with their
own mosey four pages of last
week's 16-page paper was
defeated by the board, 3-2.

The ewspaper’s business
manager, Pete Goss, had said
earlier in the week that the
paper would be 12 pages and
that he would not agree to
finance a 16-page issue.

Barnes and Howard then said
they would pay for the other
four pages ‘‘out of their own
pockets,’ according to
Gallagher. The two supported
their actions by saying that the
paper is iraditionally larger the
week before Fancy Dress and
that, due to the large amount of
copy they had received, a 12-
page issue would be cramped
and not :s pleased not as pleas-
ing to the reader’s eye as the 16-
page edition. Barnes also said
that a 15-page issue would ‘‘look
good to (visiting) alumni.”

Owen argued that much of the
issue was “‘filler’’ that could
have been used at any time and
that Barnes and Howard had
agreed to finance the extra four
pages themselves.

The cost of printing the extra
four pages was put at “‘about
$130” by Dave McLean, ex-
business manager for the
newspaper. Gallagher put the
cost at ‘approximately $100.

Mahon competition opens

by M. GrayColeman

The Department of English
has recently announced the
opening of competition for the
annual Mahan Awards in
creative writing.

Each award consists of a $100
exemption from college fees
during the year following the
one in which the award is made,
or an alternative option of $60 in
cash.

A maximum of five awards
may be given each year by the
Mahan committee: two
freshman prose awards, one
sophomore and junior prose
award each, and a verse award
for all classes except
graduating seniors.

All entries must be submitted
by noon on April 28 to the
secretary of the English depart-
ment in Payne 31. Each contes-
tant is urged to keep a copy of
his entry since the department
cannot be responsible for lost
manuscripts.

Decisions will be reached
sometime in May, and will be
announced in the June com-
mencement program. Award-
winning entries become the pro-
perty of the University; all
other entries may be picked up
after the announcement of win-
ners.

The Mahan Awards were
created due to the generosity of
George Addison Mahan. Born in
Missouri in 1851, he attended
Bethel College before his
graduation from Washington
and Lee in 1870. After gradua-
tion, Mahan moved to Hannibal,
Missouri, renowned as_ the
home of Mark Twain. In fact, he
became quite active in the ef-
forts to preserve the memory of
his town’s greatest resident.
Finally, he bought the Mark
Twain home in the town and
gave it to the city authorities as
a memorial, also erecting a
mtribute to the writer and

 

 

humorist.

Upon his death in the 1930’s,
he left W&L a legacy of $10,000
which the Board of Trustees
decreed was to be set to endow
prize scholarships for creative
writing.”

Other rules and regulations
for the competition should be
picked up from the English
department’s secretary as soon
as possible. The committee en-
courages aS many entries as
possible, though no indiviudal
may submit more than two pro-
se entries and one verse entry.
And, no awards will be made in
any class, unless in the opinion

‘Big Three” Elections Monday

Candidates
on issues

by Lee Howard,
Randy Smith & Jim Barnes

Petitions from students runn-
ing for positions in next Mon-
day’s ‘Big Three” Elections
were accepted by the Executive
Committee this week.

_ For President of next year’s

Student government, the EC
received and accepted peitions
from: Jack Bovey, Junior EC
representative; Bo Dudley, a
W&L law student; and Mike
Gallagher, editor of the Ring-
tum Phi.

Two petitions were submitted
for the Vice presidential spot
from Bill Tucker, chairman of
the Student Activities Board,
and Pete Williams, president of
the junior class.

Andy Bodenstab, sophomore
EC representative, was the only
person to submit an application
for secretary.

Tom McCarthy and Bill Pax-
ton were late entries for the
secretary's position, joining the
race yesterday. Both are write-
in candidates.

Are you in favor of increasing
freshmen representation on the
EC to two representatives?

Bovay: No. “I stand by the
old argument that committee
appointment and appropria-
tions have already been made
by the time freshmen are
elected”” and that the 12-
member EC can function more
effectly than a larger body.”

Dudley: Yes. ;

IFC vote,
Frats decide
Pres. Monday

Elections for next year’s In-
terfraternity Council president
and vice president will be held
on Monday in conjunction with
the Big Three Election.

Two candidates for each posi-
tion were nominated at Tues-
day’s IFC meeting. For presi-
dent, Jim Davis of Phi Kappa
Sigma, and Andy Fitzgerald of
Phi Kappa Psi were nominated.
The vice presidential can-
didates are Doug Seitz of Phi
Gamma Delta, and Rick Huck
of Beta Theta Pi.

The IFC will post candidate
posters itself in an effort to
maintain a “‘low key”’ election.
By majority vote, it was decid-
ed that there would be not
voting or polling regulations,
and the candidates would carry
ona ‘verbal’ campaign.

A victor will be chosen by a
popular vote of all fraternity
members.

Gallagher: Yes. The reason
for this is that I think freshmen
are entitled to just as much
representation as any other
part of the student body. They
are just as much a part of the
student body as any class.

Tucker: Yes. Bill Tucker says
he agrees with the proposal of
the law school recently submit-
ted to the EC which called for
an increase in the number of

tional representative each. “I
think by adding two members to
the EC the law school is attemp-
ting to get another resolution
passed which I am also in favor
of and that’s the initial in-

vestigating team of three in-
quirers,’’ two of whom would be
EC members and one of whom
would be president of the accus-
ed student’s school:
School, Commerce School, Art
and Sciences. Tucker said that
the 14-man EC and two EC in-
vestigators who don’t vote,
there will still be 12 members to
vote on the case. He said that is
good ‘‘so the EC wouldn’t have
to jiggle with ratios.”’

Williams: Yes. ‘‘I’d lean in
favor of increased representa-
tion.” Although Williams says
he has reservations because it
might be difficult to keep the
size of the EC manageable, he
says there are no ‘‘overwhelm-

  

Greene questions
reporters’ ethics

by Lee Howard

‘‘T suppose I have been called
on to talk about ethics because
people say I haven’t any,”’ Bob
Greene, famous investigative
crime reporter, and an editor of
Newsday, said to a delighted
audience of 75 journalists at Lee
Chapel Monday night.

Nevertheless, Greene, coor-
dinator of the widely-publized
‘Arizona Report,’ a group of
articles which explored the web
of official and mob-linked cor-
ruption in Arizona, gave his
views on the state of journalism

ehtics. What he had to say was
not exactly complimentary.

The rotund, animated
Greene, one of a series of
speakers this year sponsored by
the W&L chapter of the Society
of Professional Journalists
(Sigma Delta Chi) and the jour-
nalism ethics program, chastis-
ed journalists for accepting
“freebies.’”’

“Freebies” (free meals and
free trips received-from com-
panies that want good publici-
ty) are inimicable to unbiased

ing’’ arguments against it.

Are you in favor of salaries
for editors of publications?

Bovay: No. “I’m opposed to
any salary for any student who
serves on a student commit-
tee.”

_ Dudley: Yes.

Gallagher: Yes. I think that it
may be a good incentive for so-
meon who wanted the job, and
certainly for a person in the
middle of the year whose
grades have suffered, for them
to carry on.

Tucker: Yes. “But I think
perhaps a closer tab should be
kept and a public disclosure of

Referendums,
opinion poll

on EC ballot

by Randy Smith

Discussion of Monday’s elec-
tion and ballot additions
highlighted this week’s Ex-
ecutive Committee meeting.

On Monday’s ballot will be
two referendums for increasing
EC representation and an ‘‘opi-
nion poll’’ concerning a possible
change in the honor code.

The two referendums propos-
ed an increase in the represen-
tation of the freshman class
from one to two, and increasing
the law school’s representation
from two to three. A referen-
dv) vote is needed because
Lv involve changes in the con-
stitution.

George Griffin’ vice-
president of the EC, argued
against the addition of a second
freshman representative noting
that the ‘‘bulk of the Ec’s work
(such as subcommittee appoint-
ments and budget appropria-
tions) has already been com-
pleted by the time the freshman
representative comes to the
committee. Jim Underhill,
president of the Executive Com-
mittee, cautioned that most
honor trials involve freshmen,
and that additional members of
the committee may make it:
“‘less efficient.”’

Statements in support of two
freshmen representatives were
conspiciously lacking.

However, many law school
representatives were present

Fancy Dress change
ignites controversy

by Galen Trussell

Discussion on a proposal that
would force Fancy Dress Ball to
take place during George
Washington holiday was
postponed by the University
Council at its meeting last
Thursday.

The proposal, which states,
“be it resolved that the various
parts of ‘Fancy Dress Weekend’
occur only during the
‘Washington Holiday’,’’ will be
discussed at the council’s next
regular meeting in April.

According to John Sacco, the
student head of the University
Council, the proposal was writ-
ten by professors Beckley and
Sessions. Both Beckley and Ses-
sions said they wrote up the pro-
posal because they believe Fan-
cy Dress disrupts academic life
prior to, and after it occurs.

Sacco said the proposal came
out of a concern by faculty for
what they. feel is a lack of
motivation during the week bet-
ween Winter Break and Fancy
Dress. Sacco said he agreed

with the faculty about the
motivation problem. He also
believed there were problems
with attendance during the
Thursday and Friday before the
event.

‘“‘A matter like this can easily
be blown out of proportion.”
Sacco said. He added that when
approached about the proposal,
the first reaction by students
was, ‘‘What are you trying to
do?” Sacco said after he ex-
plained the actions taken in
drawing up the proposal, stu-
dent reaction was less severe.
Sessions and Beckley agreed
with Sacco in his belief that the
reasons behind the proposal
needed more explanation to be

fully understood.
Beckley and Sacco agreed the
proposal was posted to

stimulate student discussion on
the idea, not to inform them the
proposal was being imposed on
them. Sessions said students
should not think of the proposal
as an attempt to take away part

Jack Bovay

Jack Bovay says the Ex-,
ecutive Committee has to com-
bine a ‘“‘concern for the rights of
the accused student with a con-
cern for the opinion toward
honor of the student generation
here at W&L.”

The EC presidential can-
didate says this year has been
one in which the EC ‘“‘taken on
the role of watchdog over those
committees that receive stu-
dent body funds.’’ He says he
sees the role of the EC in that
regard continuing:’’We have to
make sure the committee
chairmen are aware of the ac-
counting guidelines and that
they are aware of the fact that
their meetings are open. The
EC ad hoc members have got to
go to committee meetings and
go over the books and make
sure that no indiscrepancies oc-
eur.”

Bovay says he is more
qualified than his opponents
because he has a ‘working
knowledge of the honor system
and the commitee system.’’ As
he says, ‘I have a thorough
understanding of the White
Book. In terms of student
government, I feel I have a good
working knowledge of commit-
tees and budgeting and the new
accounting guidelines.

An effective orientation of-
freshmen law students and
undergraduates is his first
priority, Bovay said. ‘I don’t
know what kind of mail-outs
they get the summer before
they get here,’’ Bovay says. “I
would like to see each law stu-
dent have a copy of the constitu-
tion and the student handbook,”
he adds.

But the information process
should begin at Natural Bridge,
Bovay says, and at law school
orientation. “‘We must make
sure they understand the (honor
system) is not a set of rules. It’s
more a spirit and a way of life.”
He says speeches and a mock
honor trial should be held to in-
form students thoroughly on the
honor system.

“T think the reorientation of
freshmen before exams and the
letter home to all students
reminding them of honor viola-
tions concerning independent
exams were very helpful.’’

One other way he would like
to see the honor system upheld
is by speaking with “each
newly-elected EC member to
make sure he understands the
fairness aspect(of the honor
sysem)’” with respect to not
disclosing the names of honor
defendents. He says he thinks it
was very wrong for Mike Missal

(continued on page 11)

Bo Dudley

The law school candidate for
president in the ‘‘Big Three’’
election on Monday, Waller
“Bo” Dudley, has shifted his
stance on the proposal that the
law school have three E.C.
representatives next year.

In an interview with the Ring-
tum Phi on Tuesday, Dudley
said that the argument for three
representatives ‘‘falls flat on its
face in numerical terms; no one
else has three E.C. represen-«
tatives for 300 people.”’

However, Dudley called the
News Office Wednesday to say
that he had changed his mind.
He now supports three law
school representatives on the
E.C. as a way of unifying the
undergraduates and the law
school. He also said that
undergraduates he had spoken
with had not seemed opposed to
the law school having three
representatives. Students will
have a chance to voice their opi-
nion in a referendum vote in-
cluded on the ballot.

Dudley, who graduated from
W&L in 1974, is concerned about
“leaks” of honor trial results.
As president, he would tighten
security during an honor trial
by setting setting guidelines to
prevent honor proceedings
from becoming public
knowledge. ‘‘It’s time for the
Executive Committee to have a

  

strong leader,’’ he said,
“instead of letting the Commit-
tee run itself.”’

On the Hulfish honor case,
Dudley accused the Executive
Committee of acting “‘irrespon-
sibly’’ because ‘‘they did not act
strongly and quickly”’ to resolve
the matter.

The candidate also ranks as a
top priority the improvement of
town-gown relations. After
graduating from W&L, Dudley
worked in the Virginia state
legislature. He thinks his ex-
perience in the legislature gives
him an edge in dealing with the
Lexington City Council to ex-
tend the noise ordinance. ‘I’ve
dealt more with older people’
than the other candidates, he
said, and hopes he can keep a
meeting from becoming “a
shouting match.”

The use of the gymnasium
takes a high priority on
Dudley’s platform. ‘‘I think our

Two students vie
For vice-president

Bill Tucker

Bill Tucker says his first
priority as EC vice president
would be to work on changes in
the honor system.

Tucker says he is in favor of
most of the law school’s propos-
ed honor code revisions with the
exception of their stance
against making a remark on the
school records of someone con-
victed in a public honor trial.

“T am of the opinion that
when a student is convicted in
private it is more or less given a
gift in that it’s not public
knowledge of his conviction and
when he goes public he loses
that gift,” he said.

Tucker says he has worked
very closely with the EC on
some honor cases as well as on
matters concerning the SAB.
He says his opponent, Pete
Williams, has no experience
working with the EC on finan-
cial matters. He indicates that
Williams might be ‘‘soft’’ on
honor cases by saying, ‘‘In Stu-
dent Control he might be
borderline on some _ honor
cases.”’ Tucker adds, “I have
yet to see Pete at an EC
meeting except for near elec-
tion time.”’

Tucker says he has only miss-
ed on EC general meeting all
year and has shown his concern
with the honor system by atten-
ding a honor code seminar down
in Lewis Hall. He said he will

try to uphold the honor code by
trying to keep students inform-
ed. He says it’s difficult to
discuss changes in the White
Book that law students are sug-
gesting because most. students
don’t understand what the
previous procedure has been.

Tucker said the best way to
maintain independent exams is
to maintain the integrity of the
honor system. If a student is
dishonorable, “‘get him out,”
Tucker says.

As EC vice president, one of
Tucker’s most important jobs is
to keep the books. He says he is
very familiar with the EC’s ac-
counting procedures because of
his contact with the SAB and
because he has worked over at
Washington Hall filling out
computer print-put forms.

Maintaining a balance in the
EC reserve funding would be
one of his main goals, Tucker
says. ‘“‘There’s been a tendency
to throw it away to much,”
Tucker said. He adds that the
SAB is one of the committees
that gets too much money. He
Says one of the reasons for this
is that committees rely on how
much was spent last year

Mike Gallagher

On the campaign trial he
declares himself to be a man of
action. He says that he is the
candidate who will take a stand
on all the issues. The man is
none other
PhiEditor-in-Chief J. Michael
Gallagher. Gallagher projects
this image of dynamism when
questioned on his motivation
and qualities for running for
student body president.

When asked why he was runn-
ing for the E.C. leadership post
Gallagher responded, “I think
that the E.C. has lacked effec-
tive leadership. I think through
the Ring-tum Phi, we’ve ef-
fected change, but it’s been in-
direct change. I’m running for
student body president for more
direct action by the E.C.”’ Ask-
ed what qualities he had that
would make him a good presi-
dent, Gallagher replied, ‘‘I feel
I’m a very dynamic individual.
I know as much if not more
about student government than
the present E.C. members, as
has been pointed out in some of
the editorial stances I have
taken.”’

Gallagher said that his first
priority as E.C. president would
be to “‘reorient the student body
to the value and traditions of the
honor code.’’ He elaborated on
this point saying, ‘‘I think the
first year law students need to

   
   

Pete Williams

“T’ve served on the Student
Control Committee for a couple
of years. Sometimes I’ve been
frustrated because there are a
lot of things that you can’t do as
a member of Student Control
that you could do as a member
of the Executive Committee,”
says Pete Williams, candidate
for vice-president of the E.C.

Williams is interested in play-
ing a part in the procedural
changes in the honor system.
His first priority as vicepresi-
dent would be to clarify and
codify the rights of defendants
“to the point where his rights
are clearly outlined.”’

The present junior class
president is also worried about
the entire ‘‘committee struc-
ture.’’ He accused the faculty
and who dominate the Student
Affairs Committee, of “‘usurp-
ing’’ the powers of Student Con-

than Ring-tum -

trol and the Interfraternity

   

be indoctrinated about the
honor system. I also think we
need a redefinement of the
honor code for upper-classmen.
The student body president has
the right to call mandatory at-
tenaance meetings. There the
honor system could be discuss-
ed. You could get down to th®
basic problems of the honor
system. A whole refinement is
what we need.”’

Elaborating on other facets of
the honor code, Gallagher
stated that ‘“‘to be a_ total
gentleman means more than
not lying, cheating, or stealing.
But I think that unless we
specify exactly what we mean,
we'll run into a lot of problems.
The honor code should just in-
clude lying, cheating, and steal-
ing.”

Reflecting on
the’’gentleman’’ ideal
Gallagher said, ‘‘ideally, a
W&L gentleman is supposed to

Council.

“The Student Affairs Com-
mittee has stripped the I.F.C. of
their powers; we need to cor-
rect that,’’ Williams said. He
also said that faculty members
of the SAC and the administra-
tion were trying to increase the
control of the Student Affairs
Committee over Student Con-
trol and “‘that’s not right.”’ As a
member of the University Coun-
cil, Williams said he would
work to ‘‘maintain the strength
of the E.C. and the SCC”’ so that
they could ‘‘perform their func-
tions.”

As a past member of various
campus committees, Williams
feels he ‘‘would be ap-
proachable by a large segment
of the student body.’’ He listed
the student recruitment com-
mittee, the student athletic
committee, tennis player, class
president, and _ two-time
member of the SCC as qualifica-

realized should be made. I don’t
think students understand how
much money someone could
stand to maké,” Tucker added,
‘In that they are financed by
the student body funds, I think
they should be accountable to
what student body interests
want them to write, not what a
corps of four or five writers
want them to write. They should
be sensitive to what the student
body wants and not dictate
policy on their own whims.”

Williams: Yes. ‘‘As far as
salaries are concerned, there is
some justification because of
having to make deadlines.”’ He
says Salaries are an incentive
and “might attract someone
who might not otherwise app-
ly.”” However, he says, ‘‘I have
problems with them being on a
commission basis. The business
manager might sacrifice news
space for” more profits. He sug-
gests having a flat yearly
salary.

Do you favor a cover charge
in the Cockpit?

Bovay: No. “I’m opposed to
cover charges for students in
the Cockpit.’”’ Bovay says
Cockpit is part of the univer-
sithw chih student: pay pay for
and which they have a right to
utilize without it costing them
anything. If a band is of high
calibere, he says a cover charge
could be chairgd, but not for
W&L students and their dates.

Dudley: Yes. “But I don’t
think the Cockpit should be
booked up four nights out of the
week.”’

Gallagher: Yes. I think that if
quality entertainment can be
put in the Cockpit for one night,
and if that entertainment will
cost a little more than the
money the EC has provded,
then I think it’s necessary. Of
course, the students’ pocket-
books have to be kept in mind.

Tucker. No. “I disagree flat
out with cover charges in the
Cockpit for W&L students. For
outsiders, yes. For students and
dates, no.”’

Williams. Yes. “It’s not
unreasonable to pay $1 for a
cover charge’’ for entertain-
ment ‘“‘above and beyond what
the Student Music Union or the
Cockpit can afford.’’ You can
make the argument that
Students have already paid
their student activity fee, but
it’s not too high a price for
quality entertainment,
Williams says.

Are you in favor of graduated
honor violation penalties?

Bovay: No. “I’m opposed to
any form of graduated honor
violation penalties.” Bovay
says it would tend to ‘‘dilute the
system.’’ And he wonders how
he could tell whether lying or
plagiarism is more
dishonorable.

Dudley: No. Dudley is oppos-
ed to graduated penalties for
honor violators. “I am more in
favor of a proposal that gives
equal treatment to all
violators,’’ he said, even if that
means that all honor violators
could reapply at a later date,
although that would not be his
choice. Dudley believes all

penalties to convicted honor
violators should be equal in the
interest of fairness.

Gallagher: No. I think that
once we start to ease off on the
penalties of the honor system,
then what we start to do is to
give room for more honor viola-
tions.

Tucker: Yes, with one provi-
sion: ‘It should be public
knowledge when the guy comes
back to school that he was con-
victed on an honor trial.”’
Tucker says details of the case
would not be public knowledge.
A recording of his conviction
would be put on his transcript.
A convicted honor violator
would have to wait ‘a year,
perhaps two”’ before he could
reapply to W&L. Reapplication
would be the only form of
graduated penalties.

Williams: No. “‘My gut reac-
tion is, can you define what a
serious and not so serious honor
violation is?’’ Although he says
he sees the argument that
you’re dealing with a person’s
reputation and ‘“‘you can screw
a guy for life” he says he leans
against graduated penalties.
However, he says he will be
amenable to whatever the out-
come of the student referendum
on Monday is.

Are you in favor of a third law
representative?

Bovay: No.

Dudley: Yes. Dudley said
that he is now in favor of the law
school having three E.C.
representatives because more
law school involvement on the
E.C. might go a long way
toward mending the differences
between the undergraduates
and the law school.

Gallagher: Yes. I think that
that’s necessary as along the
same reason for having two
freshmen representatives.
Each law school class is very
distinct. Now the third year law
school class is represented by
the second year EC represen-
tative. The law school is in-

creasing in size anyway.
Tucker: Yes.
Williams: Yes. ‘Per-capita-
wise the law school is

theoretically represented” and
the additional member, along
with an extra freshman
representative might make the
committee unmanageable, ‘‘I’d
lean toward increased
representation.”

Do you favor having the votes
of committee members open to
the public?

Bovay: Yes. ‘‘There are very
few cases where they should be
closed. I think the most impor-
tant thing is that we as students
are allowed to have input, that
we are allowed to influence
members of the committee.”’

Dudley: No. Dudley thinks
the vote should take place in
secret, as it is now, but the
results should be announced
publicly.

Gallagher: Yes. I’m for com-
plete open meetings. I feel
students have a right to know
how these different committee
members vote.

Tucker: No. “I’m in agree-

ment with the basic intent of
open meetings format, but I
think there are a couple of times
when the right should be reserv-
ed to withhold that privilege. I
don’t think individual
members’ votes should be
public.”’ Cases in which open
meetings would be harmful to
the committee process, Tucker
says, is when it discusses an in-
ternal conflict involving one of
its members and when it is
searching for a band. ‘‘We lost
‘four or five good groups (this
year) because we couldn’t get
people assembled in time to
make a decision.”

Williams: Yes. ‘‘I’m in favor
of open meetings.” Committees
must be accountable and
responsible to committees.
Things leak out at W&L. I knew
the theme for Fancy Dress was
the ‘Glories of Egypt in
November. You might as well
have it open.”’ Williams says he
doubts open meetings would
mean “a steady influx of
students”’ at the meetings, and
he says there might be certain
circumstances, such as SAB’s
choosing of bands which should
be done in executive session,
however he called the signing of
the Spinners, despite opposition
from a large segment of the stu-
dent body, ‘“‘unconscienable.’’

Williams: Yes. Committee
members ‘‘shouldn’t profit at
the expense of the student
body.’”’ The EC would probably
approve of parties if warranted,
he says.

Should the Law School get 95
percent of its student activity
back from the EC during ap-
propriations?

Bovay: Yes.

Dudley: No. “The E.C.

should give the Student Bar
Association a lump sum to ap-
propriate,’ as is now done,
Dudley said. Approximately 80
percent of law student funds
should be returned from the stu-
dent activity fund, which
Dudley believes would be more
realistic than the suggested 95
percent.

Gallagher: No. I think the law
school get about what they’re
receiving now — 85%.

Tucker: No. “I think that
percentage is too high. They
should get a majority of it
back.” It should be about 75-80
percent.

Williams: No. They should
probably get back ‘‘more than
80 percent but not neccessarily
95 percent.’’ He says law school
students ‘‘don’t want to screw
around with a lot of the things
you have in the undergrad.”’
However, he says it must be
remembered that this is a
university. By giving the law
school 95 percent, ‘‘In a sense
you'd be saying ‘fine’, go ahead
and become your own entity.”
He says he’d like to see the ra-
tionale behind it and more
specificity.

Do you favor coeducation?

Bovay: Should be the issue be
brought up before the Board of
Trustees, and I think it should, I
would try to articulate to the
Board of Trustees the feelsings
of the students here. Right now
I perceive those feelings to be
split 50-50. Personally I would
prefer to represent student opi-
nion.

Dudley: No.

dorm counselor and being ex-
posed to many freshmen, I’ve
recognized the frustrations that
they’ve gone through, and I
really don’t think it is that
healthy an atmosphere.

Tucker: ‘‘If it would increase
academic standards, yes. But
I’'d have to be convinced of
that.”

Williams: ‘‘Unless it’s a mat-
ter of admissions and stan-
dards, it’s not something I’d
like to see right away.”
Coeducation is ‘‘a viable alter-
native with slipping admis-
sions. I understand UVa in-
creased standards somewhat”
when it went coed. The ad-
ministration can’t be iron-
willed, Williams says. ‘Some
things do change.”

Are you in favor of having
honor advocates to represent
honor defendants?

Bovay: No. ‘‘Honor trials are
more effective when the accus-
ed speaks for himself.”

Dudley: Yes. ‘Counsel
should be allowed to cross-
examine witnesses, but not to
make the closing statement for
the defendant,’’ Dudley said. In
addition, the accused should
make his own answer to in-
quiries instead of relying heavi-
ly on his counsel for advice.

Gallagher: Yes. Both sides
could be represented fairly. An
accused person is going thorugh
a very traumatic experience.
An advisor would be more level-
headed and in arguing the case
could provide more persuasive
arguments for its case. I think
this is the only fair thing to do.

Tucker: Yes.

Williams: Yes. ‘When you’ve
got something that serious’
they’re good to have.

Should the Contact appoint-
ment procedures in which the
former co-chairmen have a vote
be changed to reduce their
power?

Bovay: Yes. ‘“‘You’ve got to
include more IFC people or EC
people, but you’ve got to have
those people on the selection
commit committee for their in-
put. Somehow you’ve got to
reduce their influence.”

Dudley: No. ‘Contact can
solicit money from whomever
they want,” Dudley said, ‘‘but
they should account for the
money to the Executive Com-
mittee and the Interfraternity
Council.”

Gallagher: Yes. I think there
should be 3 EC, 3 IFC represen-
tatives picking the contact
cot Co-chairmen and _ that’s
all.

Tucker: Yes. ‘That wov'u
an excellent idea.”’ Tucker sug-
gests that chairmen should be
chosen a week before anyone
else on the committee. ‘‘That
would give them time to solicit
workers who didn’t want to get
involved in_ politics
beforehand.”’

Williams: No. “I can’t see
taking away (co-chiarmens’)
voting power. They know more
about the qualifications and
capabilities of people on the
committee than anyone else.”

In your
Pit —

by Galen Trussell

Last week’s entertainment in
the Pit featured a four-day line-
up. Wednesday featured one of
the classics of science fiction
literature in a film which has
become one of the classics of
science fiction film. I refer to
H.G. Wells’ The War of the
Worlds.

Thinking aside now, I plan to
make a million with a UFO-
disco-Rocky flick, All I have to
do is have the aliens land
(behind a disco) and challenge
John Revolta to a_ disco
showdown at midnight. Revolta
would deal out the hustle for the
full two album sides of the Gee
Bees sound-track, before the
decision went to the aliens.

What? Have the aliens win?
Some might consider that as
blasphemous as pitting James
T. Kirk against a smart KI-
ingon. Don’t worry friends. I
won’t rip off you’re happy en-
ding. Before the aliens leave
they start teaching humans how
to dance. However, before the
humans can learn the in-
terplanetary hustle they must
discover the FUNK. Once
humans let the funk rule them
they are at ease. Man abando.

Beer Drinking Contest in Cockpit

The Washington Post and The
Richmond Times-Dispatch
have recently pointed out hat
the students of W&L are
primarily a grain-imbibing
species. But next Friday, on
Mar 17, in the Cockpit, The St.
Patrick’s Day Beer Drinking
Contest’ will be held for all
those willing to prove other-
wise.

The rules will be simple: sign
up on the entry blank in the
Cockpit some time before
Thursday, March 16, and then
show up for the first round on
Friday night at 9. Unfortunately
the maximum number of par-
ticipants will be 75, so sign up
before you lose out.

Students will be placed in
groups of five, and those fine

will ‘‘drink it out” to see who is

add slips. The final scene pic-
tures the aliens departing
assured in t. heir knowledge
that the money they invested in
polyester will double in two
light years.

Coming down to the Pit (not
to say it is a bring-down), last
Thursday night featured Burr
Datz and his traveling minstrel
friend Chris Rohrs. Rohrs who
by all reports is excellent, is go-
ing to be in the area for a while.
The Thursday performance was
also reported to be very good
and very well attended.

Over the weekend Marti Bear
returned to the Cockpit. Marti is
a real performer, very profes-
sional, knowing how to act with
his crowd. His music was
primarily well known material,
not very much original material
at all. Marti must have been‘
amused (as all who were pre-
sent) by the antics of a VMI
paratrooper who was impress-
ing the crowd with his chugging
prowess, The old tune, ‘‘What
Do You Do with a Drunken
Sailor?’? must have _ been
floating in a few minds that
night.

This week is, as of yet, very
much up in the air. Disco Dan is
planning something for yester-
day, after having infered at the
EC meeting that the UCC
wasn’t fulfilling its obligation to
do so. The UCC has, however,
planned to present the Buffalo

-Chips tomorrow night. Tonight

the movie Hustle will be shown.

Glee Club Holds Concert;

The Washington and Lee Glee
Club gave a concert at Lee

in Mexico. If this is the case, the
Mexicans are in for a fabulous

The Glee Club combined on

heard on the Parent’s Day Con-

Grieg’s ‘‘Brothers, Sing On!”’
and the spirituals ‘‘Ain’a That

Baby,” and “Ev’ry Time I Feel
the Spirit” were from the
previous concert and, due to a
“‘little’’ more practice and time,
came across more polished
than before.

ty and feeling, and the piano ac-
companiment (Jay Taggart)
was sweeping. This piece in-
deed makes full use of the width
of the keyboard.

“The Drummer and the

thoroughly charming. It includ-
ed some fine solo singing
(Claude Colonna, baritone),
some ‘“‘bow-wow’s,”’ some wed-
ding music, and even that
famous Handelian pause before
the final cadence that is so
familiar in ‘‘Messiah ‘‘

I din’t think the Glee Club
could top that song for enter-
tainment, but they did with
their final effort. “Johnny
Schmoker.”’ What a great song
and act! This number definitely
belongs in Music 151 as instruc-
tion. What better way to learn
the trombone’s and the
bagpipe’s tone colors than
through this visual and aural
showcase. Bright orange gloves
are, of course, a prerequisite.

Professor Spice has once
again rehearsed the Glee Club
marvelously and the singing
from the tenors, to the
baritones, to the basses was
balanced and satisfying. I only
wish more W&L students could
have been there to appreciate
this fine performance.

By the way, the winner of the

fessor Shillington, second prize,

tually been around for quite
some time. Their first album,
From Genesis to Revelation,
was released in 1968 by the
band’s still-teenaged founding
members: Tony Banks, An-
thony Phillips, Michael Ruther-
ford, and incredible vocalist-
visual frontman Peter Gabriel.
This was followed by a string of
albums in the early ‘70's,
climaxing in the near-classic
Genesis Live, the band’s first
live album. They were still
nearly unknown in this country,
however, until the release of
Selling England by the Pound
in 1973. The Lamb Lies Down on
Broadway, a double-LP concept
album released one year later,
finally gained Genesis the na-
tional recognition that it had
been seeking.

The controversial departure
of lead vocalist and (many
think) principal Genesis
musical force Peter Gabriel in
1975 was seen by some
observers as the death knell for
the group, but instead, Genesis
has grown ever more popular,
particularly with the release of
their latest album (and second
live LP), Seconds Out.

The permanent line-up of
Genesis now consists of: Tony
Banks, keyboards; Phil Collins,
drum and vocals; and Mike
Rutherford, guitars and basses.
Due for release to coincide with
the opening of the tour is
Genesis’ sixth Atlantic album,
appropriately entitled And
Then There Were Three...

The dates so far con-
firmed for the first leg of the
1978 World Tour are as follows:
Mar. 29, Buffalo, N.Y.; Mar. 30,

Regional Title
Eludes Cagers

by Mark Mitchell

The most successful basket-
ball season in the history of
Washington and Lee University
ended Sunday night with a 81-64
loss to Kean College in the finals
of the South Atlantic Regionals.

The Generals, a team that
had never won an NCAA playoff
game, defeated 13th ranked
Jersey City in the first round of
the tournament, 66-65, on Satur-
day.

Considering the importance
of the game, it was probably the
best win for the team all season.
TheGenerals scored the first
basket of the game but then
trailed Jersey City until 4:20
was left in the game. At that
point, Pat Dennis, the tourna-
ment MVP, scored his 28th and
29th points to give the Generals
a 62-61 lead. Moments later,
W&L led 64-61.

But Jersey City countered
quickly, acoring four straight
points to lead by one at 65-64
with 2:33 remaining.

The Generals then tried to
hold on to the ball, and get a
very high percentage shot.
However, Jersey City stole the
ball, and with only 23 seconds
left, the Generals fouled Wyatt,
a man who had scored 29 points
in the game.

Fortunately, Wyatt missed
the first shot of the one and one
and the Generals rebounded.
The Generals moved the ball
quickly down court and with on-
ly 2 seconds remaining, Mike
Wenke found Larry Meyer
underneath. Meyer made the
layup giving the Generals their
first ever NCAA playoff victory,
66-65.

The next night, against Kean
College, a team the Generals
started out very well.
Washington and Lee led 134
and then 17-10, but by half-time
found themselves down 36-32.

The Generals started the se-

cond half impressivley, knot-
ting the score at 38 all, with 18
minutes to play.

But it was to be their last

gasp. In the next 11 minutes, thé’ —

Generals were outscored 26-8 by
Kean. Many of these points
were due to Kean’s press which
forced the Generals to commit
31 turnovers. The press and the
advantage of playing on their
home court were very much in
evidence as Kean rolled off 12
unanswered points early in the
second half.

Kean’s defense prevented the
Generals from getting the
balanced scoring they were ac-
customed to. Only one man
scored in double figures for the
Generals, Pat Dennis’ who had
30. Meyers, who had 17 against
Jersey City, was effectively
denied the ball in the post,
resulting in him scoring below
his average.

Thus, very abruptly another
basketball season is over.
However, it was not just
another season. The Generals,
in a rebuilding year, won 22 of
28 games, including their first
ever NCAA tournament game.

Pat Dennis scored more
points in a single season than
any General had in anyone of
the 71 previous seasons.

While Dennis was scoring 700
points, Wenke was breaking the
old school assist record (which
he held).

At the same time, Meyer was
averaging 56 percent from the
field, was in the top 5 in the
ODAC in rebounding and scor-
ing (in additon to setting the
most vicious screens in the
ODAC) and yet was snubbed, as
was assist leaderWenke, in the
voting for the all-ODAC team.

Thus, a team that won 11 of 12
ODAC contests, placed only one
player on the ODAC first team
all-star team (MVP Pat Den-
nis) and only one player on the
second team (Dave Leunig).

Grapplers Come Up
Short In NCAA’s

The W&L wrestlers com-
pleted the 1977-78 season last
weekend by sending four in-
dividuals to the NCAA Division
III national championships in
Wheaton, Illinois. Only senior
tri-captain Howard Knipp was
_ able to win a match in Wheaton,
defeating his Baldwin-Walace
opponent 7-3 at 126.

Knipp lost his next match
10-8. Also competing for the
Generals were junior tri-
captain Ed Rodgers, losing 9-2.
to Geneseo State’s Greg Net-
tleton at 150. Junior tri-captain
Dan Kniffen lost 12-8 at 177,

while sophmore Ray Gross lost
5-0 at 142.

W&L had earlier concluded
their dual match season at 9-8
and won the championship of
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference. Rodgers, the ODAC’s
Wrestler of the Year finished at
24-9, one win shy of the W&L
single season record set last
season by Jim Crytzer. He led
the team in all individual
categories except escapes over
the course of the season.

Gross concluded his year at
22-9-2, second best on the team.

Duke Stuns Generals

For only the second time in
the past ten seasons, a
Washington and Lee lacrosse
team dropped their season
opener. The Generals were
defeated by the Duke Universi-
ty Blue Devils in Durham, N. C.
12-10 on Monday. It was Duke’s
first win over the W&L since
1968-69, and only the second
time in the past. 10 seasons that
W&L has dropped their season
opener.

The Duke win avenged an 18-5
W&L win last spring on W&L’s
Wilson Field. It was disappoin-
ting considering last year’s
Generals 11-4 finish and fifth na-
tional ranking in the University

Division. The opening loss
makes it an up hill battle from
here on in. However, we should
remember the last time a W&L
team lost their first game was
in 1975, losing 8-7 to Morgan
State. That year the team
finished 11-7 and ranked fifth
nationally.

W&L trailed early 3-0 before

exploding for six straight goals,

including two each by junior
Johnny Black and senior co-
captain Jay Sindler to take a 6-3
lead with 8:08 remaining in the
first half.

Led by Ithaca, N. Y. transfer
Tony Cullen, Duke came storm-
ing back. The Blue Devils tied

Swimuners Take ;

Third in State

The Washington and Lee
swim team had what coach Bill
Stearns called their ‘‘best show-
ing ever’’ in the Virginia State
Meet held at James .Madison
University in Harrisonburg
three weekends ago. The
Generals finished in third
place with 308 points behind
champion Richmond 414 and
runner-up Virginia Tech 384.
After W&L came VCU, William
and Mary, JMU, VMI, Hampton
Institute and ODU.

The highlight of the weekend
for W&L were three state
records. Junior transfer David
Kent set two new Virginia
records, winning the 100 back in
54.175 and the 200 back in
1:59.597. The W&L 800 free
relay team of Kent, Bob
Newcomb, Keith Romich and
John Hudson set a new state
mark of 7:04.149.

W&L was in fourth after the
first day of swimming. John
Hudson won the 500 free in
4:45.702. while Kent was sixth at
4:47.319. The Generals passed
Virginia Commonwealth on Fri-

day and held third place the

rent of the way. In addition to
Kent’s victory in the 100 back
and the 800 free relay win, Hud-
son also won the 200 free on Fri-
day in 1:45.045. Drew Pillsbury
was also sixth in the 100 back
with a 56.804 clocking

In final day action, Hudson
was second in the 1650 free at
16:53.350 and Hoke was third at
16:45.269. Romich and

Newcomb finished fifth and
sixth in the 100 free at 49.106 and
49.163. Kent topped all swim-
mers in the 200 back and
Pillsbury was third at 2:01.874.
Romich completed W&L’s suc-
cess by finishing fifth in the 200
butterfly at 2:02.600.

Seven W&L swimmers have
qualified for theDivision III na-
tional championships set for
March, 11-18 in Grinell, Iowa.
Senior standout John Hudson
qualified in the 200,500 and 1650
free events. Co-captain Romich
qualified in the 100 and 200 free
and the 200 fly. Other W&L
qualifiers were Drew Pillsbury
in the 100 and 200 back and 400
IM, Chip Hoke in the 500 and
1650 free and the 400 IM, Bob
Newcomb in the 100 and 200
free, and Jay Diesing in the one
meter diving.

The 400 free relay team of
Newcomb, Scott Duff, Romich
and Hudson and the 800 free
relay team of Newcomb, Hoke,
Romich and Hudson will also
compete. Last year the
Generals had five All-
Americans and finished ninth
nationally as a team. The first
twelve finishers in each event
are named All-American.

Due to his transfer status,
David Kent is not eligible to
compete inthe nationals but
will swim in this weekend’s
Eastern Seaboard Champion-
ships at Brown University. Kent
will compete in the 100 and 200
free and the 100 and 200 back.

the score at 7-7 at the half and
scored the first three goals of
the second half to take a 10-7
lead with 2:38 left in the third
period. The generals closed the
gape to 10-9 with 11:34 to play,
and were expected to do what so
many previous W&L teams
have done, and that’s win the
close game: But it wasn’t to be
as Duke scored two more times
and W&L once making the final
12-10.

The Generals were led in
scoring by junior honorable
mention All-American at-
tackman Jeff Fritz and senior
middle Jay Sindler each with
three goals and an assist. Black
had two goals and an assist.
Cullen completed ‘the afternoon
for Duke with five goals and two
assists for seven points.

Charlie Brown went the
distance in goal for W&L sur-
rendering 12 goals and making
17 saves. Each team had an ex-
tra man goal and Duke won the
faceoffs 16-10. Duke outshot the
Generals 41-34 but W&L took
the ground ball lead at 75-64
although Duke came up with
some key ground balls late in
the game.

The lack of outside playing
time in the pre-season due to re-
cent bad weather had an ob-
vious effect on the young and in-
experienced Generals. The
team knows that they have their
work ahead of them having lost
their top five defensemen and
the top scorer from 1977.

According to head coach Jack
Emmer, he anticipated a close
game with Duke. He summed
up the reason for Duck’s
triumph as being, ‘Duke is a
very much improved team, and
we are inexperienced.’ He add-
ed that Duke got a ‘‘couple of
breaks with deflected shots that
we didn’t.” Not wanting to ap-
pearing to be making an ex-
cuse, he explained that those
were the type of breaks that any
team expects to get to win a
close game.

Emmer felt that there was no
need to panic after the team’s
first loss. He said, ‘‘We learned
that we must hang together. We
will develop and improved as
the season goes on.”’

With U.N.C., U.Va., Rutgers,
and Hofstra on the schedule the
Generals still have their destiny
in their own hands. These are
the teams that W&L is
realistically competing with for
the playoffs. If the Generals can
register victories over these
teams, they can expect a
playoff bid for the eight team
tournament in the end of Mav.

The first home game is March
20 against Ohio State, a team
that Emmer cautiously says
“‘we know very little about.”’

Emmer concluded by saying,
“‘We’re going to need good stu-
dent support at the home games
this year.’’ He doublted that the
season opening defeat would
put a damper on the enthusiasm
the W&L community has shown
in past years for the lacrosse
team. =

Before the team entertains
Ohio State, they will travel to
Baltimore this Saturday to play
the Mt. Washington Lacrosse
Club, the 1977 club champions.

Is this what professors mean by Fancy Dress distracting

of their vacation time. He added
that if students see Fancy Dress
as a vacation, why not’ have it
during a vacation.

Sessions was emphatic about
his belief that Fancy Dress
could thrive at another time,
while not interfering with
academic work. Beckley said
he believed Fancy Dress causes
muchhavoc as far as academic
activities go.

Both professors said they
talked to several colleges
before submitting the proposal.
Beckley said he saw a general
feeling among faculty and
students that Fancy Dress was
creating an academic problem.
Sessions said he talked to some
students who, after the problem
was explained, saw the need to
move the ball.

As originally stated, the pro-
posal would reschedule Fancy
Dress in order to:

*re-establish a revered tradi-
tion,

*allow students and others to
fully prepare for, and to enjoy
the variety of activities collec-
tively denominated ‘Fancy
Dress Weekend,” without the
distractions of classes and
classwork,

*allow students and others
fully to prepare for and to enjoy
the variety of activities collec-
tively denominated “School,”
without the distractions of
classes and classwork,

*permit Fancy Dress events
to occur on or near their natural
date, viz., Valentine’s Day,

*boost the local economy
while reducing student travel
expenditures, by inducing more
people to remain in Lexington
during at least part of the
winter break, and

*nurse back to health that
casualty of overemphasis on
social life — an atmosphere of
intellectual excellence.

According to Sacco if the pro-
posal were passed by the
University Council, it would go
to the faculty, as a whole, for
vote. However, according to
Beckley, the University Council
has the. power to determine
regulations for student ac-

tivities. Beckley’s interpreta-
tion would mean that the pro-
posal would only have to pass a
vote by the University Council
to becoming binding.

Both Sacco and Beckley said
the proposal maV not come toa
vote before the University
Council. Beckley said if other
alternatives, more attractive
than the present proposal, come
out during the UC meeting, one
of the alternatives might be
voted on. Sacco said he doesn’t

_ know of any concrete method of

solving the problem, and that
the UC will be looking at alter-
natives to the proposal which
would schedule Fancy Dress
during the holiday.

Sessions said it was too early
to tell how he would cast his
ballot if the matter did come to
a vote at the next UC meeting.
Beckley said his vote would de-
pend on student reaction to the
proposal. Sacco said, as of now,
he would vote not to schedule
the ball during break.

Sacco said he wouldn’t
assume there is much chance of
the proposal being adopted, but
he could not tell what might
happen or be suggested at the
next meeting.

interest in having the use of a
facility we pay for ought to
prevail over some notion of
charity to local high schools,”
he said. “But,’’ he cautioned,
“I’m not talking about varsity
teams that have to practice in-
side’’ due to inclement weather.
Dudley’s focus is on the “‘out-
side local groups’’ that use the
gym, making it difficult for
W&L students to also use the
facilities.

Regarding the Student Bar
Association’s proposed honor
code revisions, Dudley is not
supportive of all the suggested
changes. In particular, he
believes the E.C. should have no
discression to allow honor
violators to reapply. “I am
more in favor of a proposal that
gives equal treatment to all,”’
he said, instead of the proposed
option which would allow the
E.C. to decide that-a convicted
honor offender could reapply. .

Concerning the honor
system’s jurisdiction, Dudley
believes that ‘“‘a W&L student is
always a W&L student, no mat-
ter where he acts.”’ In his opi-
nion, the honor code should

recognize no physical boun-
daries.

_During an honor trial, Dudley
recommended that certain
changes be made in regard to
the relationship between the ac-
cused and his’ counsel.
Specifically, he said that the
counsel of the accused should be
allowed to directly ask ques-
tions of witnesses, but the
counsel should not make the
defense’s closing statement. He
also recommended that the ac-
cused himself answer inquiries
directly, if possible, rather than
receiving constant advice from
counsel.

Dudley agreed that entering
first year law students need bet-
ter and more thorough honor

code orientation. ‘“‘People pass
judgement on the honor system
in the law school because of in-
adequate orientation,’, the
W&L graduate said.

“I’m going to fight like hell to
keep independent exams,”’
Dudley promised. He said that
as president, he would do
everything in his power to keep
the independent examination
system “‘until there is substan-
tial evidence of plain and ob-
vious abuses.’’ Dudley con-
siders the exam system, which
is heavily reliant on a strong
honor code, as a privilege. “If
the facts show that we have
abused the privilege, then
maybe we can’t live with
them,” he said.

The law school candidate op-
poses a separate honor system

for the law school. In addition,
he pladged to improve relations
between the undergraduates
and the law students. However,
he conceded that ‘‘it may be im-
possible to improve relations
because of the geographic loca-
tion’’ of the two branches of the
University. ‘I think with the
overwhelming number of issues
before the E.C., the two groups’
interests are closely related.

To allay the fears some
undergraduates might have at
the prospect of a law school
E.C. president, Dudley em-
phasized the fact that he attend-
ed W&L as a student. “I am not
the law school candidate com-
ing across the bridge to ram the
law school’s ideas down the
throats of the undergraduates,”’
he said.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

VOTE!

For one of the first elections in recent years students have a real
choice when they go to the polls Monday to vote for the “Big Three”’
Executive Committee officers.

In particular, the three candidates running for the presidency of
the student body offer views that represent all points on the campus
political spectrum.

Go out and vote. It is the only way you can express your view on
how you want student government to be run. Seniors: you can vote,
too; you should vote, too. You might not be here next year, but you
still owe it to the school to express your retrospective view of stu-
dent government at W&L.

Don’t try to shrug this campaign off as issueless. A great deal of
issues have arisen, some of which could mean far-reaching
changes. If issues are all you’re interested in, then at the very least
vote on the two referendum questions and one opinion poll question.
The referenda require for passage that at least half the student
body vote and two-thirds of those voting cast their ballot in favor of
the measures. W&L has not had a 50 percent voter turnout in years.
It’s about time the students were heard on the referendum ques-
tions: whether two freshmen representatives and three law school
representatives should be on the EC. And that means it’s about
time students showed up at the polls.

In order to give the voters a basis on which a critical judgement
of each candidate can be made, the Ring-tum Phi has changed its
format of election coverage. In the past, the’’coverage”’ consisted
of accepting PR releases from the candidates. That meant can-
didates could ignore the issues (if, indeed, the Ring-tum Phi had
presented any issues throughout the course of the year) or couch
them in vague, flowery campaign literature.

The coverage of the presidential election, for obvious reasons,
has put the Ring-tum Phi in a curious position. However, the staff
has been given its complete independence. Your attention is
directed to the staff box below.

In order to avoid even the appearance of conflict of interest,
however, the Ring-tum Phi will not comment on the presidential
race. But this does not prevent us from taking an interest in another
“Big Three” election. The battle for secretary of the EC could be
very interesting. While Andy Bodenstab was the only candidate to
file a petition for the post, Tom McCarthy and William Paxton have
announced write-in campaigns.

It is encouraging to see that students such as Mr. Paxton do not
like to see offices left uncontested and want to contribute to the stu-
dent government process. But we must seriously question Mr. Pax-
ton’s experience. He has been totally uninvolved instudent govern-
ment to date.

Mr. Bodenstab, who served on the EC this year, can point to a
year’s experience on the EC. If you consider just showing up at
meetings to be helpful ‘‘experience.’’ While serving on the EC, he
has been one of its most inactive, inconspicuous and inconsistent
measures.

The only logical choice for EC secretary is Tom McCarthy. Mr.
McCarthy has served with distinction as SAB secretary this year.
He has never missed a meeting and has painstakingly carried out
the duties of SAB secretary where such duties in the past were per-
formed haphazardly, at best. Without knowing or having to know
McCarthy’s stand on the issues, the Ring-tum Phi unequivocably
supports him. His candidacy should be welcomed and supported by
anyone who is concerned with having qualified and diligent
students leading the EC.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry
Pub board answers

Dear Editor:

I have never felt compelled to
get the last word in on a con-
troversial issue, especially
when the position I support has
already been capably defended
by others. In spite of the elo-
quence of Lee Howard and Amy
Herring, however, I feel that
some sort of statement from the
Publication Board is called for
as a complement to their efforts
and as a response to the
“righteous indignation” (if I
may borrow from your refined
vocabulary, Mr. Healy) of the
EC.

The letter to the editor co-
authored by Jim Underhill and
Tom Healy was disappointing in
its poorly disguised theme of
frustration. They have every
right to use words such as ‘‘ad-
mittedly,” “‘regrettably,” and
‘unfortunately’ to introduce
sentences which explain their
recent action (or inaction). I
commend the EC for being able
to admit its mistakes, but I de-
fend the Publications Board’s
irritation of the letter is a lesson
in paradox: ‘Considering the

Ring-tum Phi’s zealous concern_

for the rights of students, the
front page identification of a
student convicted of an honor
offense is inexplicable.’’ Inex-
plicable? Why, it makes all the
sense ‘in the world. It is the
students’ right to know when
the Honor System has been
reduced to a bad joke, when a
convicted offender peddles his
wares on campus, and when the
EC twiddles its thumbs and
looks the other way.

In another part of the letter,
Healy and Underhill refer to the
Publications Board’s respon-
ding ‘with the predictable
litany of prior censorship and
first amendment priorities.”
Assuming that at least half of
this letter was written by a law
student, and noting the evident
disdain for the principles on
which this “‘predictable litany”
is based, I find such a statement
alarming. It is ironic that while

. the Publications Board was at-
=

eaateaaere

zeeaactetrveretave

tacked for having a (shudder)
somewhat flexible policy, the
EC, and its White Book, with all
its sections and articles, could
not cope with the problem of
dismissing a recalcitrant of-
fender from campus.

The Ring-tum Phi has
recognized its obligation to the
Honor System not by shutting
up but by speaking out. There
are times when the machinery
of justice needs adjusting; the
Publications Board views tbe
actions of the Ring-tum Phi not
as a wrench thrown between the
gears, but rather as a well-

administered whack at the right —

moment.
Sincerely,
Ryland Owen
Pres., Pub. Board

Handbook
mistakes

Ken Mastrilli

Glaring mistakes in the 1977
Student Handbook have surfac-
ed in the Ring-tum Phi’s in-
vestigation of various non-
existent and _ leaderless
organizations like the Indepen-
dent Union and the Student Cur-
riculum Committee.

Hopefully SAB chairman Bill
Tucker will heed our findings by
thoroughly editing and updating
next year’s Student Handbook.

Also, faculty members
responsible for portions of the
student catalogue might give
more than just a cursory glance
to their their particular respon-
sibilities so that incoming
freshmen will not be led astray
by “misinformation”.

The Phi’s investigation did
not cover various organizations
like the outing club, the brass
ensemble, the Sazeracs and the
chess and croquet club, seeing
no need to belabor the point that
there are many organizations
whose worthiness of being in-
cluded in student publications is
questionable.

Healy
clarifies

DearEditor:

The recent Herr-
ing/Gallagher attack on my
concern for students’ rights was
misguided. I favor strengthen-
ing procedural safeguards that
protect an accused student
from unfairness. At least ten
days ago the chairman of the
student Control Committee
received a letter from me urg-
ing that the following rights be
incorporated into the SCC state-
ment on Procedures and
Policy:

A student shall have the
right—

1) not to say anything that

» might incriminate him,

1) to have adequate time to.
prepare his defense, and

3) to be accompanied by an ad-
visor during the Student Control
hearing.

The SCC voted to include
these rights, as well as my sug-
gestion that a student be in-
formed of these rights before
being questioned by a Student
Control Investigator.

Ms. Herring would not know
about any of this, of course,
because rather than talk with
me about it, she consulted only
one source before writing her
letter. Next time Amy, let’s
talk. We sit only four carrels
apart.

The Jessup International
Moot Court team from
Washington and Lee Universi- .

cond in a regional competition

Catholic University won the

in W&L’s Lewis Hall. The

Honor Code changes

proposed by SBA:

The Student Bar Association
has proposed that several
changes be made in the Honor
System.

1. The single sanction: This
would be retained, with the
modification that the EC or stu-
dent jury may permit the con-
victed student to apply for read-

mission after a time determin- .

ed by the appropriate
aforementioned body.

2. Investigation of offenses:
The present system calls for 3
members of the EC to in-
vestigate a possible offense.
These members may then sit in
judgment. Under our proposal,
2 EC members, chosen on a
rotating basis, and 1 student
chosen at random from the
same school as the alleged
honor violator would make the
initial screening investigation.
The two EC members would
then be disqualified from hear-
ing the case, in the event that
the EC chose this line of action.

3. The jurisdiction of the
Honor System: As currently
written, the White Book ap-
pears to give the EC wide
geographical jurisdiction. Our
_ proposal would limit the EC’s

jurisdiction to Lexington,
Rockbridge County, or
wherever a student represents
himself as being enrolled at
Washington and Lee.

4. The advisor’s role in the EC
hearing and at public trial: The
accused’s advisors should be
allowed to question witnesses
before the private hearing, dur-
ing the private hearing, and at
the public trial. Further, the ad-
visor should be allowed to pre-
sent any evidence for the accus-
ed. The accused will still be re-
quired to make his own closing
statements.

5. Permanent notation on the
student’s record: At present, a
student convicted by a public
trial has a notation placed on
his permanent record to that ef-
fect. This penalizes him for ap-
pealing his conviction. Thus, we
urge that no notation be made
on a student’s record that the
student left the University as a
result of an Honor violation.

6. A better focus on what con-
stitutes an honor offense: The
SAB feels that ‘“ungentlemanly
conduct” is too vague and

 

CEPASTAT MOUTHWASH

HUDSON’S VIODAY PLUS IRON

(a one-a-day vitamin
for the rundown student)

openended a standard. Rather,
we propose that the system
focus onlying, stealing, or
cheating.

The Student Bar association
board of.Governers issued this
explanation of their proposed
honor system changes:

“The SBA has sent a list of
proposed changes in the Honor
System to the EC. We have
spent several weeks examining
the System, investigating stu-
dent complaints and soliciting
student comments. The pro-
posals submitted reflect our
response to what we found.

It should be noted that we
made a specific decision that it
would be best for all concerned
if there was one Honor System
for all students of the Universi-
ty. We see ourselves as part of
tbe University with an interest
in strengthening those areas
that we feel need it.

We feel that a change in the
penalty for commission of an
honor offense is in order. Adop-
tion of our recommendation will
strengthen the Honor System by
adding a degree of flexibility
that has not existed and by
making the system appear less
draconian.

As the system now operates,
expulsion is the only penalty for
an honor offense. With this in
mind, many students viewing or
knowing of an honor violation
hesitate to inform theEC. While
they know that a wrong has
been committed, they fee that
the penalty is too harsh. Hence,
they act as judge and jury and
keep silent. Further, the EC
has, in effect, used a form of
flexible penalties. Certain of-
fenders who were in fact guilty
of offenses were not convicted
due to the insignificance of their
offense when compared with
the extreme penalty. This selec-
tive application of the expusion
sanotion seems to deny certain
offenders of equal protection
under the system, and has the
general effects of weakening
the student respect for the
White Book.

Thus, an adoption of our pro-
posal would merely codify the
realities of the situation, and
would lead to a rehabilitation of
the system, both in its degree of
sophistication and in the eyes of
the students, who in the last
analysis must operate under it
andenforce it.

rather than thinking all expen-
ditures out. He suggests a finan-
cial report be due at the end of
every year detailing every ex-
penditure so that next year’s
committee could decide
whether some of the money
might have been wasted.

On the issue of oversight of
committees, Tucker said the ad
hoc system is a good system,
“but it’s not followed up
enough. It seems like the only
time the SAB was ever brought
out was when something was
printed in the Phi. The press
should get on government when
government hasn’t exercised its
duties, but I don’t think the

 

(for prompt relief of minor

government should wait for the
press to lead the way.”

Tucker says too much of an
issue has been made of Student
Control’s allegedly overlooking

student rights. He said only one
case brought before the com-
mittee was even marginal on
that issue, but adds he agrees a
list of student rights should be
made explicit.

Tucker said he is in favor of
“‘a little special priority’ for
minority student applicants,
but W&L “should not ignore
standards. I am not a reverse
discriminst,’’ he said. However,
“If a white Caucasian has the
same board scores as a minori-
ty, go with the minority.”

Asked his opinion on declining
applications, Tucker said he
doesn’t think it is a big problem.
He says he has seen a report
which indicates applications
are down from the top level and
the bottom level of applicants.
Since W&L draws largely from
the middle level of applicant,
according to Tucker, admission

standards should not be a pro-
blem.

Tucker called the Ring-tum
Phi’s decision to print the name
of an honor defendant ‘‘inex-
cusable.’’ He said printing an
article of that nature is con-
trary to the honor system.
Tucker said the article could
have been printed if the identity
of the person was not made
known.

On the subject of relations
with the law school, Tucker
said, ‘Communication will
solve 9) percent of the pro-
blem.”’ If undergraduates were
aware that the law school pro-
posals are in the best inte est of
everyone and is not done for
their own self interest, some of
the’ problems could be cor-
rected, he said. Communication
must be on all levels, not just in
the top echelons, Tucker em-

hasized.

 

Williams: Hoping to be VP

tions.

Regarding student subcom-
mittees, Williams said that the
E.C. should maintain its right to
make committees accountable
to them, but should not become
‘‘a police force.’’ Appointments

_ are the key. “‘We’ve got to ap-

point people who wé can trust,”
he said.

‘Whenever a cop walks into a
party where there are 50 people
who have been drinking and
there’s a band playing and he
tells them to stop, there’s bound
to be an ugly situation,” the
vice-presidential hopeful said.
He characterized present stu-
dent police relations as ‘‘good,”’
but was bothered by the ‘‘sud-
den’? enforcement of Lex-
ington’s noise ordinance.
Williams feels the I.F.C. and
the police need to work together
more closely to avoid confronta-
tions.

The current animosity bet-
ween W&L’s law students and
undergraduates is a ‘‘sad situa-
tion’’ to Williams. ‘‘This is sup-
posed to be a University,”’ he
said. However, he noted that
“their interest in the E.C.
demonstrates to me a_ will-
ingness on their part to work
within the system to effect bet-
ter relations’? between the two
schools.

Williams said that intramural
sporting events were an effec-
tive way of smoothing relations.
He also encouraged fraternities
to “go out of their way to
welcome law students to their
parties.”’

He was opposed to the
publication of the Hulfish honor
case. ‘‘You try to have an honor
trial within a vacuum, but word
leaks out,”’ he said, ‘‘ but to blab
it all over the front page of a
newspaper is wrong because it
violates that individual’s
rights.”’

Although he conceded that the
Hulfish case was ‘‘exceptional”’
because he remained on cam-
pus, ‘‘the Ring-tum Phistill

Williams believes’ the
jurisdiction of the honor system
should be ‘‘within the communi-
ty where the reputation of W&L
is immediately at stake.’’ He
questioned ‘‘the practicality” of
applying the honor system out-
side of Lexington.

On upholding the honor code,
Williams said there was a need
for ‘‘strict’’ enforcement.
‘‘Honor is something that
should be assumed and not
necessarily questioned. We
need to create a system where
the people aren’t embarrassed
or afraid to come before the
committee and report an honor
violation,’’ Be gnig.

Jim Foreman, the treasurer
or the Student Activities Board
nnounced he had resigned
rom the board at an SAB
eeting held Sunday night.
Foreman, who has served on
the board for three years, said
Ihe was resigning because he
needed to devote more time to
his senior thesis, an architec-

   
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
  
   
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
   
  
   
   

field, Virginia.

Bill Tucker, chairman of the
SAB said Foreman had been
considering resignation before
Charlie Hulfish resigned.

Both Tucker and Foreman
reported the SAB’s financial
records are in good shape.
Tucker said the board had ap-
roximately 15 to 16 thousand
ollars going into Spring term.
oreman said he balanced the
books as well as he could after
ancy Dress, and that Tucker
ill be handling the books until
new treasurer is found.

The SAB also voted to recom-
end that the EC appoint Bill
idge as a replacement for
oreman. Ridge was appointed
to the board only two weeks
go. Foreman said Ridge had
been working with him on the
books during the year, and that
Ridge was the logical choice to
fill the vacancy. Foreman add-

Foreman resigns

ed he believed Ridge had plann-
ed to run for treasurer of the
SAB next year.

In other action, the board
discussed an offer for the band
Levon Helm and the All stars.
According to Tucker, the band
has recently formed and is look-
ing for engagements. The band
features performers like Paul
Butterfield, Dr. John, and three
former members of Booker T.
& the MG’s. The deal offered
the SAB included Livingston
Taylor as a warm-up for the
Allstars, at a package price of
$8,500.

The board also discussed they
possibility of financing a
building to house Unversity par-
ties. The building suggested
would be similar to the
pavillion, but would be located
somewhere on W&L property.
Two board members plan to
discuss the idea with the
University treasurer.

The SAB also gave its ap-
proval to plans to have a Spring
Cookout at the pavillion. The
university Food Service,
through Jerry Darrell and Burr
Datz, offered to provide free hot
dogs for the party, if the SAB
would organize the other
aspects of the event. The board
plans to set a date for the party
next week.

 

 

Flu just Red Scare

by Wade A. Forsman

Have you been sick? You’re
not alone. The flu has struck
W&L, along with many other
campuses, harder this year
than in the past. But take heart,
because according to Dr. Fed-
deman of the infirmiry, the
worst is over.

Though it may be disappoin-
ting for some, odds are that the
rash of sickness here is not the
acclaimed Russian flu. Dr. Old
of VMI sent cultures of the virus
found in this area to the Center
of Disease Control (CDC) in
Atlanta three weeks ago.
However, the results have not
yet been received. Despite this
lack of verification, the belief is
that the flu here is of the normal
intestine or diaherrea variety.

Exactly what strain it is,
though, is irrelevant. The strain
is important only to those
developing a vaccine. The
symptoms are basically the
same for whatever kind of flu.
Regardless of the strain, as Dr.

Feddeman says, “you still
hurt.”
How many students have had

the flu this month? Though the
cases are in the daily log, the in-
firmiry has not kept a count,
and could not say offhand. But it
was pointed out that many peo-
ple don’t go to the infirmiry
when they are sick. “Some we
never see,” says Dr. Fed-
deman, ‘“‘so we really don’t
know.”’ The reason Dr. Fed-
deman believes he doesn’t see
everyone is because people
know what to do about the flu.
There is not as vivid an im-
agination as he’s seen in the
past with other flu outbreaks.
The flu has struck college
students particularly hard. Con-
trary to popular belief, the
reason is not because of

-oawegeeueeaeeete°

students en masse style of liv-
ing but because students have
not built up a natural immunity
to the flu. Those over 25, Dr.
Feddeman points out, have a
much smaller chance of cat-
ching it than those under that
age.

To a lesser degree than W&L,
Lexington High School has also
had a prroblem with the flu. But
VMI has been hardest hit. Their
lifestyle is even more favorable
to the flu than outs. Unlike VMI,
there are few people with four
in a room here, Dr. Feddeman
pointed out.

Around the state, the areas
hardest hit have been Faifax
County and the Washington
area along with the Norfolk
Metropolitan region. The
Shenandoah Valley has been
spared except, of course, for its
colleges.

Many of those who go to the
infirmiry go, not for treatment,
but for advice. They are wor-
ried about catching their room-
mate’s or fraternity brother’s
flu, and wonder if there is any
preventative. There isn’t. By
the time someone’s roommate
catches the flu, he’s probably
already spread his germs
around. It’s that contagious.

In one respect, the flu is
similar to the cold: There is no
cure. The only recourse is to do
what’s always been done: rest,
liquids, and aspirin. If it doesn’t
go away, go to the infirmiry.
Dr. Feddeman rejects the
prevalent belief that a_ visit
means forced incarceration for
days on end. He points out that
people with the worst cases
stayed two or three days at the
most.

As Dr. Feddeman said: ‘‘The
moment their temperature goes
down, they go out.”

When is a Journalist

a Times §

(continued from page 1)
reporting, Greene said. The
press has always protested
when public officials receive
free favors, he said, but main-
tains a double standard by hav-
ing no hesitation to receive
themselves.

Greene equated present-day
journalism ethics with that of a
“Times Square pimp hustling
12-year-old girls.’”’ He added,
however, journalism ethics
have “‘infinitely improved over
the period when bribes, free
meals and free trips’’ were used
to buy off reporters. ‘‘We now
disdain bribes,’’ he said.

Journalists are more ethical
than doctors, lawyers, and
statesmen, Greene contended,
“but that’s only a comment on
the ethical standards of our
time.”

“‘Purveying of truth” is the
one critical test of journalism
ethics, Greene said. The people
must not be deceived, he said,
for if they are to govern wisely
they must be aware. That
means the press must “‘fix on
substance rather than form,”
Greene admonished. He ex-
plained that the press must not
just print what people say is the

- truth; it must print the truth.

A code of ethics doesn’t
necessarily promote the truth,
Greene said. As a matter of
fact, according to Greene, jour-
nalists ‘‘have done better
without a code of ethics than
lawyers have with one.”’

Although the Newspaper
Guild has attempted to draw up
a code of ethics, it has largely
failed because of disagreement
on basic issues. Greene pointed
out that one of the major pro-
blems with a code is that
“fierceness of competition (in
journalism ) makes ethical stan-
dards absurdly difficult.”

Greene said ethical problems
in journalism arise because of
conflicts between ends and
means. For instance, Greene
asked, would it be right to steal
a government document which

 

proved the crime of a public of-
ficial? One reporter on the New
York Times said he would lie,
cheat and steal for a good story.
But the Long Island newspaper-
man said that statement is
blatantly unethical because it
indicates the reporter would lie,
cheat and steal for any article.

Greene said there are only a
few occasions when it would be
right to lie, cheat or steal. He
said those occasions would
come up when there is a
‘compelling public necessity”
for a story to come out and the
reporter has “‘exhausted every
honorable way” to acquire the
story.

An example of compelling
public necessity, Greene said,
would arise when a reporter
Saw a document on the desk of a
Pentagon official setting out
plans for a Pentagon coup
d’etat. As Greene put it, “If I
left it there, I would be ethical;
if I stole it, I would be a good
newspaperman.”’

On other ethical issues:

—Greene said he saw no pro-
blem with a journalist posing as
someone else, unless he posed
as someone involved in the
judical process such as a judge
or a policeman, or if he posed as
someone normally expected to
keep things confidential, such
as a priest, lawyer or doctor.

   

quare pimp?

—Greene said journalists’
practice of not turning someone
they know has committed a
crime over to police in order to

acquire information on a
higher-level criminal does not
leave them open to ethical ques-
tions. Police do the same thing
all the time, Greene said. They
give minor criminals immunity
in exchange for testimony in-
dicting leading criminals.

—Greene said journalists
should turn over to police in-
formation they receive from
people speaking on the record
with only second or third hand
information. But he said if the
source tells him something off
the record, he would go to jail to
protect the source.

—Greene condemned biased
reporting, saying “I am a
political neuter,’’ he charged
that some reporters in 1964 had
“gleefully misquoted (Barry)
Goldwater,” while asking Lyn-
don Johnson ‘‘respectful ques-
tions.”” He quoted Jimmy
Breslin, then of the New York
Times, as saying about
Goldwater, ‘“‘The minute I saw
him in Madison Square Garden
Ihad him pegged as a fascist.”’

In concluding his speech,
Greene said journalism ethics
has a long way to go, but some-
day it ‘‘might rise to the level of
a Park Avenue pimp selling
legal aid.”

act honorably all the time.
When you remove a student
from the W&L community,
then I don’t think that you can
expect him to act honorably. If
a person’s action doesn’t affect
the W&L community, then I
don’t think you can penalize
him.”

As expected, Gallagher ap-
proved of the Ring-tum Phi's
printing of the name of a recent-
ly convicted honor offender.
Gallagher said, ‘‘I feel that it
should have been published

ing a mockery of the honor

pus. The E.C. didn’t act. Some
of their own members said ‘but
he’s such a nice guy.’ I think the
student body should be made
aware that an unwanted person
was using them.”

Contrary to popular belief
that the E.C. is too powerful,
Gallagher said, ‘‘I don’t think
the E.C. is exercising the power
they have to the fullest degree,
as in the Hulfish case, and in
making the committees funded
by the E.C. financially accoun-
table. I think that they can con-
trol these committees a lot
more than they have been will-
ing to do. The E.C. has an
obligation to do this.”

Sensitive to the entertain-
ment needs of _ students,
Gallagher believes that some
priority of E.C. appropriations
should exist for the Student Ac-
tivities Board. He said, “I
definitely think that since the
SAB is the only organization on
campus which provides enter-
tainment for the students out-
side the fraternities, then I
think they should get the bulk of
the money.”

In an effort to make student
organizations more account-
able to the E.C., Gallagher said,
“I would require the ad hoc
E.C. members to give weekly
reports as to what went on at
these meetings. I would play a
major role in the selection of the
co-chairmen and of the commit-
tee members. I would question
them about their feelings on
open meetings and parties. This

would play a big part in my .

decision on whether or not they
should serve on that commit-
tee.”

Speaking to the issue of a stu-
dent’s rights when he is involv-
ed in a Student Control hearing,
Gallagher said, ‘As I outlined
in one of my recent editorials,
Ithink the SCC constitution
should be rewritten to take into
consideration the rights of the
accused. For instance, people
shouldn’t be compelled to

 

testify against themselves.”

‘‘T am in favor of independent
exams,” Gallagher said. ‘‘I feel
we should have redinement
seminars on the honor system
for the upperclassmen. I think
this would .remove the am-
biguities on what honor viola-
tions are on exams. You could
invite faculty members to give
their views on this subject at
such a meeting.”

Gallagher did not believe that
admissions standards should be
lowered for minority ap-
plicants. He said, ‘‘I think there
are many qualified members of
minorities out in the country. I
think that the admissions com-
mittee has to enlarge its
endeavor to appeal to these peo-
ple.”

Answering another question
concerning the decline in ad-
missions, Gallagher said, “I
think they’re going to have to
send out more propaganda
brochures to more people in dif-
ferent parts of the country than
they have in the past. I think a
study should be undertaken on
the feasibility of coeducation
again. Coeducation would at-
tract more applicants.”

Advocating improved rela-
tionships with the law school,
Gallagher said, “I definitely
think they should be improved.
I think the law students have a

lot to offer the undergraduates

and the undergrads a lot to offer
law students. I think we should
add another law_ school
representative to the E.C. We
should carefully look at some of
the changes they have proposed
for the honor code, and see
which ones would be beneficial.
I think undergrads could help

the law students become
familiar with the honor
system.”’

Interested in improving the
relationships between the
University and the town,
Gallagher suggested that ‘‘the
school needs to set up a council
comprised of town fathers,
faculty members and student
leaders. They can meet once a
month and discuss tbe problems
that arise between the town and
the school. W&L community
service could be discussed.

When asked whether or not he
felt that he could work effec-
tively with Washington Hall ad-
ministrators in view of his past
differences of opinion with that
group, Gallagher responded, ‘‘I
can get along with people fairly
well in a close working environ-
ment. I think Washington Hall
will recognize that I represent
the students’ wants. I feel that
tbey’ll regard me as any other
representative of the students.’’

Chairmen receive accounting guide lines

by Paul Daugherty

A memorandum reminding
all student subcommitteess of
their obligations to the student
body was issued Monday to sub-
committee chairmen by Ex-
ecutive Committee Secretary
Neil Pentifallo.

The memo is simply a com-
pilation of all motions passed by
the EC this year dealing with
the responsibilities of student
subcommittees, said Pentifallo.

The crux of the memo is a sec-
tion detailing the accounting
guidelines that subcommittees
are expected to follow. The
guidelines stipulate that,
among other things, no student
organization may authorize a
loan. This provision was promp-
ted by an incident which oc-

urred last spring, when former

tudent Activities Board Co-
chairman Charlie Hulfish took
out a personal loan from the
SAB treasurery, which receives
its money from the central stu-
dent body fund. Hulfish promis-
ed to pay back the loan within a
month, but didn’t do so until the

fall, when the EC first
discovered he had taken the
loan.

A requirement that all net
profits of student subcom-
mittee, must revert to the cen-
tral student body fund at the
end of the school year was also
included in the accounting
guidelines. This provision was
spurred by the actions of the
Contact committee, which the
EC discovered had kept over
$800 in two separate bank ac-
counts over the summer, a
violation of the student body
constitution.

Other guidelines listed in the
memo require that subcom-
mittees retain all receipts, to

-make sure that all the checks

they write are for legitimate
purposes, and that if receipts
are to be collected and kept
overnight, night deposit bags at
the United Virginia Bank are to
be used.

The memo also outlined other
subcommittee obligations,
namely that meetings must be
open except when votes are be-

ing takes, and that subcom-
mittees must receive EC ap-
proval to throw a party.

Many of the motions included
on the memorandum were pass-
ed in the fall. Pentifallo defend-
ed its tardiness by saying that
all the motions on the memo
were included in the minutes of
the EC meetings in which they
were passed. He also said that
each subcomittee chairman is
provided with a copy of the
minutes of all Executive Com-
mittee meetings.

Junior EC rep. Jack Bovay
call the memo the EC’s attempt
to ‘‘watchdog’’ the subcom-
mittees.

“Subcommittees should be
made accountable to the
students whose money they are
spending,” he said. ‘The ac-
counting guidelines are on way
of doing this.’’

Enforcement of the provi-
sions mandated in the memo
will be the responsibility of the
various EC members who serve
as ad-hoc members of the sub-
committees, Pentifallo said.

 

Bovay on the honor system

(continued from page 2)

to talk to the Ring-tum Phi
about an honor case. But the
most important way to see the
honor system is upheld is to
vote to remove a person if he’s
guilty, Bovay says.

Asked about a proposal that
honor offenses be limited to
placeswhere students represent
themselves as being from
W&L, Bovay says, “I would
find it hard to differentiate bet-
ween places where someone
represents himself as a W&L
student and places where he
does not do so.’’ You ‘‘can’t put
a geographical or time boun-
dary’’ on acting honorably or
dishonorably. The honor system
is “‘a spirit to get W&L students
to act honorably at all times.”’

Talking about other subjects,
Bovay said coeducation could
help admissions. ‘‘Coeducation
would probably play a very big
role in increasing quality ap-
plicants and that would be a
major thing.

On relations between law
students and undergraduates,
Bovay says what is needed is a
“better information process.”
He says things such as the Stu-
dent Activities Board’s ‘“‘At-

titude Adjustment Hour’’ at the

law school in the fall could help
the information process. He
said Student Bar Association of-
ficers speaking at Natural
Bridge may also ease tensions.
On relations with police,
Bovay says the most pressing
problem is the noise ordinance
violations. He said perhaps the
IFC, Dean John and Dean Mur-
phy could have some talks with
the city commissioners. He also
says the school’s attorney could
go over the statute and ‘“‘see if
there are any ways of getting
around it.” He adds that some
people from the University
could lobby with the city com-
missioners. Even _ faculty
members should take an in-
terest in the issue Bovay says,
because the ordinance

which is a ‘“‘very integral part of
W&L.”’

On the issue of Student Con-
trol, Bovay said, “I believe the
motion I made a few weeks ago
summed up my opinion that
Student Control should rewrite
its purposes and procedures
and statement of purpose so it is
more clearly defined in the
areas of preliminary investiga-
tion, procedure to be followed
during the Student Control
hearing and the rights of the ac-
cused student.”

On Student Control’s drug
penalties, Bovay said ‘‘As long
as there is a Universitypolicy on
drugs, then Student Control is
going to have to abide by that
policy. Last year’s penalties

“were way too stiff(when they

sent letters home to parents).”’

(continued from page 1)

for the proposed addition of a
third law school EC member.
Tom Healy, EC law school
representative, proposed the
motion for a third represen-
tative so that all three law
classes would be represented on
the EC. Presently, the third
year class is represented, and
the first and second year
students share one represen-
tative.

Past law school representa-
tion had been one Ecmember
for 120 law students. Supports of
the proposed increase argued
that the law school has increas-
ed in size by 50 percent, and in
order to achieve the same ratio
as before, the number of
representatives to the EC
should grow from two to three.
“By giving each law class its
own representative, it is hoped
that a more harmonious law
school-undergraduate relation-
ship will result,’’ proponents
argued.

Opponents to the law school’s
increased EC _ representation
questioned whether
threemembers might not be a
disproportionate reparesenta-
tion of that body.

Based on voter turnout, the
EC will decide at next Monday’s
meeting whether to continue the
referendum for two more days,
as prescribed in the constitu-
tion.

Also on the ballot will be a
revision to the honor code pro-
posed by the law school’s ad hoc
committee which examined the
honor code in-depth. The law
school has recommenced that
some convicted honor violators
be allowed to reapply to W&L.

Under the law school’s sug-
gestions, a verdict of guilty
would be made on the presump-
tion that the person would be
dismissed from the University,
but he may show reason for be-
ing allowed to reapply. Persons
found guilty would not be allow-
ed to appeal thier punishment,
but would have to appeal the
verdict.

ad as

Dudley elected
as president

by Lee Howard

For only the second time
since 1965, a law school student
has been elected president of
the student body.

Waller T. “‘Beau’”’ Dudley won
Monday’s Executive Commit-
tee presidential election, while
Biil Tucker was elected vice-
president.

Dudley won a surprising first
ballot victory by outpolling both
Jack Bovay, EC junior
representative, and J. Michael
Gallagher, Ring-tum Phi editor.
Dudley received 58 percent of
the votes cast in the largest
election turnout in recent
history. Almost 1,100 students
voted out of a student body of
about 1,700. That’s a turnout of
about 65 percent.

Dudley needed at least 50 per-
cent of the vote in order to avoid
a run-off. As it turned out, he
received 640 of the 1,092 votes
cast. Meanwhile, Bovay could
only manage 275 votes (25 per-
cent) and Gallagher 177 votes

(17 percent).

In the race for vice-president,

tivities Board chairman,

Law school
code changes

a mixed bag

by Randy Smith

Exercising prudence- and
discretion, the Executive Com-
mittee spent more than four
hours deliberating over the Stu-
dent Bar Association's propos-
ed changes to the honor system
Monday and Tuesday night.

The law school’s proposal for
a graduated penalty, giving the
EC an opportunity to allow a
convicted honor violator the op-
tion of reapplying, was defeated
by a narrow margin.

Approved was a proposal that
the pre-trial investigation of an
alleged honor violation be con-
ducted by two EC members and
a student.

The EC also retained the cur-
rent two-thirds vote conviction
instead of the recommended
three-quarters vote needed to
convict under the SBA’s pro-

posal.
(continued on page 11)

garnered 54 percent of the votes
cast. Pete Williams, junior
class president, had the other 46
percent. Only 969 students voted
in the vice presidential election,
with Tucker receiving 527
ballots in his favor to 442 for
Williams.
ANALYSIS

Beau Dudley’s strength seem-
ed to be in the Red Square area
and at the law school, a strange
combination indeed. Dudley’s
strength in the Red Square was
not that surprising. As a former
Phi Kappa Sigma president, he
shares the conservative
political= attitude prevalent in

Davis, Huck win I.F.C. posts

Jim Davis and Rich Huck
stepped into the presidential
and vice-presidential positions
on the Interfraternity Council at
Tuesday’s I.F.C. meeting, of-
ficially ending the terms of
Steve Mattesky and Howdy
Knipp in those leadership roles.

Davis (Phi Kappa Sigma)
defeated Andy Fitzgerald (Phi
Kappa Psi) for the presidency,
336-260. Rich Huck (Beta Theta

Pi) edged out Doug Seitz (Phi
Gamma Delta) for the vice-
presidency by 49 votes in Mon-
day’s election.

Phi Kappa Sigma and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon led Monday’s
fraternity voter turnout in the
I.F.C. elections, both with over
50 members voting.

The new president called for
nominations and elections of
next year’s I.F.C. Judicial

Leon Helm and R.C.O.
All-Stars, Saturday

Two police officers, possibly
from the Sheriff's Department,
will be at Saturday’s concert
featuring Levon Helm and the
R.C.O All-Stars to avoid securi-
ty problems experienced at the
last Student Activities Board
concert, SAB chairman Bill
Tucker said at Monday’s Ex-
ecutive Committee meeting.

At the last SAB concert, the
Thursday before Fancy Dress,
sophomore Jesse Shaver was
hit over the head with an empty
beer bottle. The concert was
staged in the old gymnasium, a
building in which consumption
of alcholic beverages is pro-
hibited.

Tucker said it is difficult to
have students do security work

because students often let their
friends in with alcohol and

because students are not a sym-
bol of authority.

Police officers will have a
symbol of authority, but they
will not be allowed to search
students, Tucker said. He did
say, however, that officers
would have the right to deny en-
trance to students suspected of
concealing alcoholic beverages.

Although alcoholic beverages
will be prohibited, students will
still be treated to a good time,
Tucker said. He said Levon
Helm is an _ up-and-coming
group. He compared them with
the Allman Brothers Band
which came to W&L in the ear-
ly ‘70s just before it became a
popular group.

The leader of the group,
Levon Helm, is somewhat of an
innovator in the rock field. He

referendum
fails

by Lee Howard

An amendment which would
have given the law school a
third Executive Committee
representative failed passing
by only seven votes Monday
after the EC voted 7-4 not to ex-
tend voting on the amendment
to Wednesday.

The EC’s action effectively
killed the referendum as well as
any chance another referendum
has which have given the
freshman class two represen-
tatives. Both referenda were
approved by a majority of
students, but not by the two-
thirds majority required to pass
an amendment to the student
body constitution.

Students voted 656-338 (66 per-
cent) in favor of adding a third
year law representative. The
law school now only has an up-
per class representative and a
freshman representative.

New SCC procedures

‘Student Control Committee Chairman Jim McNider submitted a
list of six changes in SCC procedures designed to guarantee the
rights of all students at Monday’s Executive Committee meeting:

1. The accused will be informed of his rights, including his right

to remain silent.

2. The accused may have an advisor present during the Student

Control hearing.

3. The accused will be given a reasonable time to prepare a

defense.

4. The accused may be present during all testimony and may
question the witnesses. This does not apply to the preliminary hear-

ing.

5. The accused can look at all the physical evidence against him.
6. The accused will be notified by the Student Control Committee
as toexactly what the procedures it uses will be.

Pub Board split 3-2-2
on eight-page RtP

The Publications Board voted
3-2-2 last Mon. afternoon to
allow the Ring-tum Phi to have
two 12-page issues and two 8-
page issues for the rest of the
term.

Since the vote was taken, two
12-page Ring-tum Phis have
come out, meaning the final two
of the term will both be eight
pages.

The Board’s decision went
against a recommendation by
business manager Peter Goss
that the paper only contain
eight pages the rest of the year.
The Board recommended that
Goss return during the spring
term to reassess the paper’s
financial situation. At that time,
it was felt, Goss and the Board
would have a clearer picture as
to how the financial situation
was progressing.

Goss, in presenting his pro-
posal for an eight page paper
the rest of the year’ said at the
minimum that would leave $500
to cover any unexpected
charges the Ring-tum Phi
might incur over the rest of the
year. He said his estimate was
based on the lowest per week
cost of producing the paper and
on average per week advertis-
ing revenue. Goss said the
lowest possible cost to produce
an eight page paper, a figure he
admitted the Ring-tum Phi
news staff had hit for the
previous seven weeks, is about
$334. He said average advertis-
ing revenue per week is about
$311.

Managing editor of the Ring-
tum Phi Lee Howard used
Goss’s figures against him.
Noting that Goss’s list of
revenue was running about
$1,500 ahead of deficits, he ask-
ed how Goss could only predict
a $500 profit. Since only 10 more
issues of the paper are schedul-
ed to come out and since the dif-
ference between the cost of an
eight-page paper and average
advertising revenue is only $23,

Howard predicted the Ring-tum
Phi would make $1,270 under
Goss’s proposal.

Howard also used Goss’s
figures to back up his conten-
tion that even if the Ring-tum

 

Correction

Part of last week’s EC article
was not published due to a prin-
ting error. That part was:

Steve Abraham, sophomore
EC representative, introduced
a motion which would disallow
campaigning by ‘any can-
didate or his representative’
within 15 yards of the polling
area on the day of the election.

In addition, Abraham propos-
ed a motion designed to secure
the integrity of the election: ‘‘At
no time will a student attempt
to influence the vote of another
once a ballot has been received,
and the secrecy of one’s ballot
shall be maintained at all times
by those manning the polling
area.”

Both motions were passed by
the EC with the provisions that
the polling areas would never
be left unattended, and that
violations would be reported to
the Voting Regulation Board.

 

 

 

Phi went 12 pages the rest of the
year, it would net a profit. Goss
had said earlier that the cost to
produce a twelve page pager is
about $406, assuming the
minimum cost. Howard said
that, based on average adver-
tising revenue, that would mean
a 12 page paper would lose
about $95 per issue. With 10
issues remaining, Howard said
only $950 out fo the current
$1,500 surplus would be used up.
Thus, Howard said, ‘“‘simple
arithmetic’”’ shows that even
with continued 12-page papers
the Ring-tum Phi would net
about $550.

Goss disputed Howard’s con-
tention, saying that using the
average advertising revenue of
$311 is unrealistic because
advertising tends to drop off
during the last few weeks of
school. He predicted the
average advertising figure for
the rest of the term would be
about $300 per week. Goss also
said he was not sure production
costs could be kept to a
minimum. He added that cer-
tain unexpected expenses could
arise.

Ring-tum Phi editor Mike

_Gallagher said the record of his

staff over the past seven weeks
should be a good indication that
it will stay within the minimum
production cost schedule.
Howard later pointed out that
Goss’s lower advertising
prediction would mean a
change of only about $11@ in the

Ring-tum Phi’s profits. He said
the paper would, at a minimum,
make $440 even if it was a 12-
page paper the rest of the year.

Publications Board President
Ryland Owen said Goss should
not be questioned on his projec-
tions because he, as business
manager, is in the best position
to know the state of the
newspaper’s finances.

Grant Leister, Calyx business
manager, finally made a com-
promise proposal. He suggested
the Ring-tum Phi go eight pages
twice and 12 pages twice the
rest of the term. Gallagher,
Calyx Editor Temp Webber and
Leister voted for the proposal,
while Owen and Goss voted
against it. Ariel editor Parker
Potter and Publications Board
Treasurer Jeff Bird abstained.

After the vote, Gallagher urg-
ed the board to vote on whether
it is devoted to seeing that
publications make a profit or to
seeing that a quality paper
comes out every week. The
board did not feel compelled to
vote on the matter.

In other action, the board
voted unanimously to include a
journalism professor on the
board at all.times starting next
year. News Information Direc-
tor Bob Keefe made the pro-
posal, saying that as the Ring-
tum Phi becomes more ag-
gressive in its pursuit of news, a
professional advisor would be
worthwhile.

Young Democrats
are liberal

by Lee Howard

In a recent survey of the
members of the Washington
and Lee Young Democrats, 65
percent called themselves
either liberal or very liberal,
while only 16 percent said they
were conservative.

The survey was answered by
85 percent of the YD’s 87
members. No member called
himself very conservative,
while 19 percent of the
members said they are
moderate. Distinctions of

The officers are: President,

left-right spectrum.

Despite the self-designated
liberal orientation of the club,
34 percent of the members said
they had become more conser-
vative since coming to W&L,
while only 18 percent said they
had become more liberal.
Forty-eight percent of the YDs
said they had not changed their
political outlook.

The Democrats’ survey also
included a survey of members’
attitudes toward several impor-
tant issues.

In themost nearly unanimous
vote on the questionnaire, 84
percent of YDs said they favor
legalized abortion. Only 11 per-
cent were opposed to abortion.
The emotionally-charged issue

undecided answers on the poll,

Members were somewhat
less reluctant to favor federal
funding of abortion. Yet 67 per-
cent favored the idea, while on-

The Equal Rights Amend-

cant margin. Sixty-nine percent
said they favored the proposal

from ratification. Twenty-one

student affairs and for admis-
sions activities, will act as ad-
missions director until a new
director is named.

A 1949 Washington and Lee
graduate, Farrar joined the
staff in 1952 as assistant direc-
tor of admissions. When the late
Frank J. Gilliam retired as ad-
missions director in 1962, Far-
rar succeeded him in that post
and was, also named associate
dean of students.

Farrar said his new duties
will be a ‘“‘challenging change.
“T will be working in an area
that requires the kind of profes-
sional guidance and coordina-
tion to which I can bring my ex-
perience in admissions and my
knowledge of Washington and
Lee’s constituency.”

Noting his length of service in
the admissions directorship,
Farrar said his resignation
reflected his conclusion that
“the job is one that no one per-
son should hold indefinitely,
both because of the pressures it
entails and the need for new
perspectives in student recruit-
ment and selection.”

Huntley praised Farrar’s
“dedicated and skillful service”’
throughout the 16 years he was
admissions director. ‘‘Jim Far-
rar is one of Washington and
Lee’s great strengths and

26 years he has performed in-
valuable service to the universi-
ty, and I am gratified to know
that he will continue to do so in
the years to come.”’

In his new position, Farrar
will expand the use of alumni,
both as individuals and through
organized alumni chapters, in
attracting qualified students to
attend Washington and Lee. As
coordinator, Farrar will work
closely with Director of
Development Farris P. Hot-
chkiss and with Alumni
Secretary William C. Washburn
in drawing on ‘‘the enthusiasm
and energy of Washington and
Lee’s far-flung alumni,’ he
said.

“For years,’ Farrar com-
mented, ‘‘we have seen effec-
tive use made of alumni by
other colleges and universities.
While Washington and Lee has
been able to make only limited
efforts along these lines so far,
our experience clearly in-
dicates that we have a large un-
tapped source of help in our
alumni, if we can coordinate
and direct their efforts proper-
y.”

Huntley said Farrar is better
qualified to undertake that
challenge than anyone else he
knows of.

Trussell resigns as SMU head

cites conflicts with Dan Scott

Galen Trussell has resigned
as chairman of the Student
Music Union, citing the “‘straw
that broke the camel’s back”’ as
being Dan Scott’s ‘‘condescen-
ding” attitude when he told
Trussell he had the authority to
veto any act Trussell wanted to
book into the Cockpit.

Trussell said Cockpit night
manager Scott told him he
received the veto power from
Dean John, University Center
Director, Mike Cappeto and
treasurer James Whitehead.
According to Trussell, Scott
said he could veto any act
Trussell planned for the Cockpit
if he had already decided to pay
for an act out ofCockpit funds.

Trussell said his relations
with Scott have been worsening
throughout the year. He said he
resented a statement made by
Scott at last week’s Executive
Committee meeting to the ef-
fect that Trussell was not br-
inging enough entertainment in-
to the Cockpit. He said the
reason he had not was that the
EC had chastised him for
overspending his budget during

the fall term. He pictured
himself as being a man in the
middle; damned if the EC if he
got more entertainment and
damned by Scott if he didn’t.
Trussell saidhe had tried to
follow Scott’s advice during the
fall term, but had to exert more
of his own authority to keep ex-
penses down this term.
Worsening relations with

Scott was not the only reason

Trussell gave for resigning. He

said he has to leave for the spr-

ing term to do a journalism in-
ternship in Staunton. He also
said he has pressing time com-
mitments during the rest of this
term.

Trussell recommended two of
his hardest-working Music

Union members to succeed him.

He said Keith Leeper and Ken
Rose have both worked equally
hard and are good friends, so

      
   
        
    
        
   
 
    

   

they should be made co-
chairmen. Previously, Trussell
had been sole ‘iversity Center
Committee, a job thats main
function is to coordinate
musical entertainment in the
Cockpit through the Music
Union. Trussell said he sees the
fledgling SMU as more of a club
than a committee, although it
seems to have become a com-
mittee. He said the original in-
tent of the SMU was to get
students together who were in-
terested in or wanted to play
music. He said he would like to
see that idea expanded so that
the club could arrange to have
seminars with guest artists, or
have a forum to talk about
music, or even arrange a week-

ly jam.
Trussell added that he has
about $650 left in the

SMUbudget. He said he expects
the new co-chairman will re-
quest between 300 and 500 addi-
tional dollars to pay for a heavy
entertainment schedule in the
spring. And, Trussell says, he
expects they will get the addi-
tional money. He said he has
talked with at least four EC
members who indicated they
would support an additional
monetary request.

Next year’s SMU should re-
quest about $5,000 Trussell said.

The Washington and Lee
University chapter of Phi Beta
Kappa will induct 26 students
Monday (March 20) in Lee
Chapel.

Among the events planned for
the day to honor the inductees
are a lecture by David D. Bien,
a 1951 Washington and Lee
graduate who now teaches
history at the University of
Michigan, and a banquet in the

Phi Beta Kappa
induction Monday

With the additional $1,700 over
last year, the Union could put
an act in the Cockpit almost
every weekend in which there
were not some other major ac-
tivity going on, he said. And, he
added, the Cockpit could put
together whole weeks of enter-
tainment, as it has come close
to doing a couple of times this
year.

Trussell said that next year’s
SMU, seeing that it is funded
separately by the EC, should be
independent from the SAB,
Right now all expenditures
must go through the SAB
treasurer. He says the SMU,
since it will be dealing with so
much money and since its func-
tion is separate of the SAB,
should have its onw treasurer.

Trussell said there are only
two things he felt he was unable
to accomplish as head of the
SMU. He said he has been
unable to get boxes moved from
the dartboard area of the
Cockpit which makes it hard for
students to distinquish it from a
storage area. He said the Union
paid $55 for the dartboard and
he would like to sse it used.
Trussell added he has been
unable to convince Cockpit
manager Jerry Darrell to in-
stitute regular weekly happy
hours.

Concert for MS planned

Outlaws and Sea Level contacted

by Ben Kesee

Multiple Sclerosis cripples
and kills. It is a disease of the
central nervous system which
hardens brain or spinal cord
tissues or both. A good deal of
money is needed to support ef-
forts to develop a cure for MS
and Executive Committee
President Jim Underhill wants
the W&L community to lend a
hand, but not through tedious
fund-raising or personal dona-
tions. Rather, plans are to allow
students to benefit MS by atten-
ding an outdoor music festival
staging groups like the Charlie
Daniels Band, the Outlaws, and
Sea Level.

However, Jim says that
although the organizational
steps have fallen into place with
an unusual amount of ease,
nothing can be done. Why?
Because it takes money to make
money and in this case, thirty
thousand dollars. in front meney

is needed to finance the affair.
So far, an investor has not been
found. According to Jim, if an
investor is found, he stands not
only to gain a monetary profit of
some amount, but to benefit the
MS cause and Washington and
Lee’s image as well.

Underhill and Washington
and Lee student Kirby Tom-
pkins have contacted the bands,
and they expressed a definite
interest in performing.
However, the bands also ex-
pressed that they will not play
free of charge. They will con-
sider playing at a cost below
normal outdoor concerts.

The location planned for the
event is ‘““Expoland,’’ an amuse-
ment and recreational facility
at the junction of Interstates 81
and 64. Jim assessed the loca-
tion as being more than ade-
quate due to its accessability,

spacious parking .area, toilet ;

facilities, and available stage
equipment.

Underhill also expressed con-
fidence that the concert would
do more than simply break
even. He attributes his op-
timism to the letters of endorse-
ment he has received from the
national MS officials, in par-
ticular, a letter form the sports
director of the organization,
Ara Parseghian. Also, twenty
area colleges and universities
including Virginia Tech and the
University of Virginia at Arl-
ington. Jim believes that pro-
motion can easily be obtained,
without charge, due to the
nature of the event.

The appeal of an outdoor con-
cert is surefire. The organiza-
tion is solid and the cause pro-
mises benefits to all involved.
But, unless an independent in-
vestor is found, the project will
have tobescrapped.- «>

   
     
  

  
   

“Red Square Machine“

effective for Dudley

(continued from page 1)
those fraternities. In fact there
was a report of a ‘‘Red Square
Machine’ which got the vote
out for Dudley.

Dudley’s victory at the law
school was a bit more surpris-
ing. He received about two-
thirds of the votes cast in Lewis
Hall. Although Dudley is a law
student, he hardly represents
the generally liberal political
views over at the law school.
And his waffling on the issue of
having a third law school re-
presentative, first announcing
he disagreed with the proposal
then coming out in favor of it
would seem to have placed
him in a vulnerable position.
But, as one law student put it,
“Law students vote for their
own kind.’’ While
undergraduates didn’t seem to
view the election as a law school
versus undergraduate battle,
the denizens of Lewis Halli
would seem to have.

Gallagher, who seemed to
represent law school viewpoints
more closcly than Dudley,
received most of the rest of the
law school votes. But he did
most of his campaigning in the

law school, while Dudley spent /

most of his time in
undergraduate strongholds
such as the freshman dor-
mitories. One major difference
between Gallagher and Dudley,
however, is that Dudley focused
on uncontroversial issues such
as decreasing the use of
Doremus Gymnasium by local
high schools and_ doing
something about the noise or-
dinance violation. Gallagher in

Cash prize of $100

 

the meantime was forced to de-
fend his controversial stances
on open meetings and students’
rights. Gallagher was also seen
as a threat to the fraternity
system because of his paper’s
attacks on khaki culture and
certain fraternities. It was
generally agreed Gallagher had
made too many enemies to win
the election.

Bovay, in the meantime,
seemed to be the middle-of-the-
road candidate, usually an en-
viable position. But Bovay did
not seem to wage an aggressive
campaign, relying on his ex-
perience with the EC to be a
compelling reason to vote for
him. Because Bovay did not
seem to be receptive to changes
the law school has been ad-
vocating, he only received 10
votes from Lewis Hall. But
Dudley outpolled him on the
main campus, too.

Some observers thought
Bovay’s defeat was a referen-
dum on changes the EC has
made this year, much as
Gallagher’s was a referendum
on the editorial position of the
Ring-tum Phi. If that is the
case, one law student said,
“The EC is going back to the
dark ages.” That is yet to be
seen, but Dudley is undoubtedly
concerned with maintaining
certain cherished W&L tradi-
tions, among them being the
fraternity system and an all-
male undergraduate body. He
does, however’ favor some of
the law school honor changes.

SAB announces Movie
Program for Spring Term

by M. Gray Coleman

This year the SAB struck
gold...For many years, the
Movie Subcommittee presented
many good films to the student
body; but, the turnout from the
students often left something to
be expected, and the Board
seemed to have resigned itself
never to turn a profit in this
area. That is until now. The cur-
rent Board members decided to
take a gamble — consistently
high-quality movies were to
come to W&L, at a greater cost
than ever before. They hoped to
break even, due to the greater
“name appeal” of the presenta-
tions.

They were all in for a sur-
prise; suddenly, the Movie Sub-
committee was rolling in
surplus cash!...Attendance at
all films has reached a record
high, people even sitting in the
aisles for recent showing of The
Omen. Evidently, there was a
lot of discussion about what to
do about the windfall. The end
result — a happy one — was a
decision to put the money back
into a top-quality movie
package for the Spring Term,
which has recently been finaliz-
ed.

The SAB will be presenting
movies four nights a week dur-
ing the term; Friday through
Sunday, there will be $1 films in
duPont Hall, and then on
Thursdays, free movies in the
Cockpit. The schedule for the
Cockpit is as follows: The Spy
Who Came in From the Cold
(April 20), The Apprenticeship
of Duddy Kravitz (April 27),
The Odd Couple (May 4), Laura
(May 11), and Italian Job (May
18).

In their choice of these films,
the Board showed a decided
preference for relatively cur-
rent boxoffice successes;
however, there is one great ex-
ception in Otto Preminger’s
Laura of 1944. This film was one
in a long string of very suc-
cessful forties thrillers, started
with The Maltese Falcon. The
tightly woven plot involves a
poor, but honest cop who in-
vestigates a murder in high
society (of course, the victim is
Laura herself). As he in-
vestigates the gruesome crime,
he becomes entranced with the
portrait of Laura... and when
the supposed victim inex-
plicably returns to her apart-
ment, the search is on — not on-
ly for ‘‘who did it’’ but ‘‘who did
they do it to?” (for there is still
the annoying problem of that

unnamed corpse...)

Meanwhile (under the big top,
as it were), four favorites will
be playing in duPont. They are:

Marathon Man (April 21-23),
Islands in the Stream (April
28-20), Gone With the Wind
(May 5-7), and The Shootist
(May 12-14). The latter two
shows will have only oen per-
formance per night, at 7 p.m...

Of all the films in this spring’s
line-up, probably none is an
eagerly awaited as that version
of Margaret Mitchell’s “great
American novel,’’ which swept
the Oscars of 1939. Not that it
didn’t have stiff competition;
that year is generally regarded
as the greatest the industry
ever had, presenting among
others — Stagecoach (with John
Wayne in his first big hit),
Disney’s Pinocchio, The Grapes
of Wrath, Dark Victory with
Bette Davis, Goodbye Mr.
chips...and the greatest film
fantasy of all time, The Wizard
of Oz.

Few movies have become
such cult attractions; every
line, every frame of Gone With
the Wind has been a cherished
possession to millions, since its
premiere at the _ recently-
demolished Loew’s Grand in
Atlanta. The film took some
three years to put together, and
was in filming for a year. Of
course, most of the early work
was wrapped up in the famous
“‘search for Scarlett’? — over
1,400 women were interviewed.
Out of these, some 90 got screen
tests Everyone from Lana
Turner to Paulette Goddard,
who was almost signed for the
role when Vivien Leigh arrived
on the set on the night Atlanta
was burned. And the search
came toa sudden, happy halt.

Shown all-too-rarely on col-
lege campuses due to its length,
Gone With the Wind was the big-
gest box office success since
Griffith’s Birth of a Nation, 25
years before. And it was to hold
that position for 25 more...It is
the crowning achievement of
1930’s Hollywood, the model for
MGM prestige, and the greatest
day for that long-extinct
creature, the Hollywood
character actor. We may still
have the stars, but the likes of
Prissy and Big Sam, Belle Watl-
ing and the evil Jonas Wilker-
son will probably never be seen
again...So catch this movie — in
fact, catch as many as possible.

And, as for the SAB, they
couldn’t be happier —it is too be

hoped that their gamble will
continue to pay off. “The only
thing we have to worry about is
what to do when the good
movies run out.’’ Luckily, the
chances are doubtful...

One other announcement —
speaking of gamblers, one sure
thing that the SAB will repeat is
that annual zoo, the Spring Porn
Flick... By popular request, this
year’s biggie will be The Devil
in Miss Jones. Two shows will
be held every night after The
Shootist in duPont (May 12-14)
at 9 and 10:30 p.m., for another
charge of one dollar...

The Ritz: Modern Comedy to
Open in Boiler Room

by M. Gray Coleman

In its philosophy, the Univer-
sity Theatre often stresses that
it is, above all, a teaching facili-
ty. Its primary objective, in
view of this, is to present as
many theatrical styles and
works of different authors and
periods as possible — and all in
a brief four years. Priorities
must be set, whether
Shakespeare or O’Neill or
Albee. And, generally, they
manage to present a season
greatly appealing, if only for its
diversity.

Unfortunately, there is one
great problem to face. Granted,
the UT is a teaching facility, but
what good is any play in front of
an audience of ten? Let’s face
it — most of us don’t want to be
morally edified in the Boiler
Room, or thrown into fits of
depression in the Troubadour
over the “human condition.”
Comedy and musical — that’s
sure boxoffice appeal. .

So, how do you reconcile what
the students should learn, and
what the audience wants to
see? About the best that can be
done, is, again, to balance. And
so, the fourth major production
this year is (low and behold!) a
contemporary American com-
edy, The Ritz by Terrence
McNally. It is to be directed by
senior Barry Godin as his thesis
project, with the assistance of
stage manager Phil Heldrich. |

at the Yale Reperatory Theatre
in 1974; moving to the Longaire
Theatre on Broadway in 1975, it
was a rapid success, running
for 15 months. Among its many
honors were three Tony
Awards, including Rita Moreno
as the Best Actress in a Com-
edy.

The story is fast-paced, and
may be outlined as follows, the
head of a New York Mafia
“family” dies; his dying words,
“Get Proclo,”’ put out a death
contract on his bumbling son-in-
law, Gaetano Proclo (played by
Warren Mowry). Proclo, flee-
ing for his life, tells a cab driver
to take him ‘“‘to the last place in
New York where I could be
found,” and ends up at The Ritz,
a gay bath-house.

There, the befuddled man
from Cleveland meets a galaxy
of characters — from Chris
(David Sorrells), the life-of-the-
party type, who is overjoyed to
find out that heterosexuals are
often as victimized as the
patrons of The Ritz; to Claude
(Larry Loveridge), the “‘chub-
by chaser’’ who tries to pin Pro-
clo down, only to remember
him as an old Army buddy; to
the outrageous Googie Gomez
(Anne Secor of Sweet Briar), a
down-and-out-singer who works
in The Ritz’s disco. Googie is
forever intent on finding ‘‘Mr.
Big,”’ the great producer who
will take her away. Determined
to see Proclo in this role, she
becomes, '_ increasingly
frustrated — he thinks she’s an
insistant transvestite...

Things really take off as Pro-
clo’s brother-in-law, Carmine
(Bill Matthi) arrives, intent
upon the contract — followed by
Proclo’s wife Vivian (Lola
Vialani). And the chase is on...
everybody determined to ‘get
Proclo.”’ Vivian wants to get
him home; Carmine would
prefer the bottom of the East
River; Claude just wants to roll
on a fat man; and Googie wants
him to catch her act (as she
says, “We save the hanky-
panky stuff for later, chico...) It
all results in a highly comic
finish, as The Ritz survives its

 

 

heterosexual invasion...but only
barely.

The set, designed by Tom
Ziegler and Ellen Jervey, adds
a lot to the show’s effectiveness.
The illusion is one of endless
hallways with small rooms —
one character calls it a
““Chinese maze.”’ In fact, a ma-
jor point to notice is that
characteristic of endless
wandering which the various
patrons assume. The rooms of
Proclo, Carmine, Claude, and
Michael Brick, the detective
(Rich Allen), are suggested
through open walis. Ramps,
and even overhead platforms,
result in the literal use of the en-
tire Boiler Room by Ziegler and
Jervey.

In speaking to director Godin,
many points about the show and
its particular challenges.
“Above all, we have to realize
that timing means so much in
comedy’ and a crisp tempo is
all-important,” he said. “This
show involves more physical
movement (i.e., chase scenes,

* people hiding under various

beds) than any other show this
year. So we had to ask a lot of
the actors, but they have
delivered quite well. Above all,
The Ritz is not only one of the
funniest comdeies of errors in
recent years, it is also well-
written. And it is a good test
play for a thesis — in terms of
diction, management of a large
cast, and pace.”

The play will run next Mon-
day through Saturday, March
20-25, at 8 p.m. in the Boiler
Room Theatre. Reservations
are necessary, and free tickets
for W&L people can be obtained
at 463-9111, ext. 371 during the
day.

In the end, The Ritz ’means’”’
nothing; the stress here is pure
enjoyment and laughter. There
‘'S no social statement to be
ade, except that people, with
a'l their strange ways (whether
Mafia don or bath-house
fatron), can still be amusing
and strangely endearing.

The Goodbye Girl:

A Good Movie is hard to find

by Robert Boardman Tremblay

With every passing year not
only in Hollywood turning out
fewer pictures, it is turning out
fewer quality pictures as well.
When one considers that The
Towering Inferno, a vintage

bore, was nominated ‘for Best :

Picture in 1974, the situation
since the golden '30’s has ob-
viously worsened. With condi-
tions as they are right now, it
would be imperative for the
serious moviegoer not to miss
any good pictures that come to
town for following right after
them might be ten colossal
bombs, such as Saturday Night
Fever or a Walt Disney sleeper.
That’s why it’s a must to get
your two dollars out and go see
The Goodbye Girl at the Lyric.
This is truly an excellent film,
one of the few really fine movies
of the year.

Though the story is hardly
original, it is still retold with
some refreshing twists. The
story concerns two people
(Eliot Garfield and Paula

; McFadden) who at first loathe
each other but at the end fall in
love. He is a struggling actor
from Chicago, she is an ex-
dancer who’s just received a
Dear Jane letter and whose ex-

boyfriend has kindly sublet the
apartment to Garfield. Of
course, Paula is not too keen on
Garfield moving in, but since
the apartment is his, there’s not
much she can do. Garfield is
kind enough to allow her and
her daughter to stay, however.
An old story for sure, but what
gives this picture such power is
the superb acting of Richard
Dreyfuss (Garfield), Marsha
Mason (Paula), and Quinn
Cummings as Lucy, Paula’s
daughter. This trio is
marvelous throughout and the
script from a play by Neil
Simon, Mason’s husband, is
priceless as well. Comedy,
sadness and poignancy are all
rendered brilliantly here, it’s no
wonder this picture is
nominated for five Academy
Awards.

Of course, one scene in this
film is worth the price of admis-
sion itself. This is the scene
where Dreyfuss has to play
Shakespeare’s Richard III as
an outright homosexual.
Dreyfuss’ interpretation of this
character is nothing short of
hysterical. Imagine Truman
Capote shouting, ‘‘A horse, a
horse, my kingdom for a horse’
and you have the basic idea.

Mason herself is sterling as
the goodbye girl which is sup-
posedly a story of her romance
with Simon in the first place.
The other bright spark in this
film, is, of course, Quinn Cum-
mings, the child star, following
in the footsteps of Tatum
O’Neal, is also up for an
Academy Award in her first
film. Quinn as Lucy is a child
beyond her years and her
language and quick mind prove
it, but she is more convincing as
a sensitive, depandent child
than Tatum O’Neal, who was
the one who ran the show in
Paper Moon.

The Goodbye Girl is obviously
one of those movies that should
not be missed, it has that rare
combination today of a good
story, great acting, and tight
directing as well. Dreyfuss, an
actor of amazing versatility and
ability, (his former films in-
clude American Graffiti, Jaws,
and Close Encounters of the
Third Kind) could easily win
Best Actor for his performance
in this movie and it’s easy to see
why. He really steals the show.
The Goodbye Girl is indeed a
movie that deserves a look. In
today’s era of cultural decline,
good movies are a hard find.

As announced in last week’s
Ring-tum Phi,Levon Helm and
the RCO All-Stars, along with
special guest Livingston
Taylor, will appear at W&L’s
own Warner Center this Satur-
day at 8:30 PM. While their
names may not be immediately
familiar, a brief history of some
of the band me ers may refresh
your memory.

Levon Helm himself is pro-
bably the best-known member
of the group, having served as
drummer and vocalist for The
Band. The Band, of course,
played with Bob Dylan for a
while, and had several hits of
their own, most notably ‘‘Up On
Cripple Creek.’’ Helm sees his
duties in his current group as
simply ‘‘to sing on key and not
give up any slack on the time or
feel.”

Chicago-born Paul Butter-
field, world-renowned _har-
monica player, is best known
for his work with the Paul But-
terfield Blues Band. He ap-
peared on the original
Woodstock album, and infact,
currently resides in Woodstock,
New York.

Booker T. Jones (Booker T.
and the MG’s) plays organ for
the RCO All-Stars. He feels that
the band represents ‘“‘a con-
sortium of musical styles and
backgrounds drawn from each
of the players who were raised
up and down the Mississippi
River.”

The SAB has (at least tem-
porarily) moved away from the
Bill Deal-Shirelles syndrome,
and has decided to provide the
W&L community with some
high-quality musical entertain-
ment. You can expect a good
show by what is definitely a
band to watch for on the
musical scene.

THE

RING-TUM PHI

 

Baseball season starts,
first home game Sat.

With only two seniors on the
team, the 1978 baseball
Generals appear headed for a
challenging season this spring.
Coach Joe Lyles, now in his 19th
season as head baseball coach
at W&L, points to the lack of
proven depth and inexperience
as the current weaknesses on
the ‘78 Generals.

Lyles expresses optimism
however, in regards to the up-
coming season, “We feel we
have tremendous jump on our
opposition despite the fact that
the weather has limited our out-
door practice. The combination
of our successful fall program,
a winter weight training pro-
gram, and our spirited indoor
practice that began in January
should all work in our favor.

‘Two main factors will effect
our won-loss record in 1978,”
says Lyles, ‘‘Pitching and
defense, and hitting. Those are
always 99 percent of the game.”’
W&L will again compete for the
ODAC baseball crown with
defending champion Lynchburg
and always tough Randolph-
Macon listed as the pre-season
favorites. Bridgewater,
Eastern Mennonite, Emory &
Henry, and Hampden-Sydney
will also compete in conference
paly. Each ODAC school palys
two games against every other
conference member.

The W&L pitching staff will
be composed of all
righthanders. Sophomore Chip
Childs (1-7, 3.72 ERA in 1977)
will be the stopper on the staff
along with sophomore Vic
Shepherd (1-4, 5.08 ERA in
1977). Also on the staff are
sophomore By Steele (0-5, 5.40
ERA in 1977), junior Bruce
Williams, and freshman Scott
Stafford.

Catcher Maynard McCorkle,
a three year starter, has been
lost to graduation, but
sophomore lettermen Kevin
Moynahan (.222) returns with
great promise. Freshmen Dan

Kingman and Tom Coates will
fight Moynaham for the job.

Junior Mike Busbey (.271) led
the 1977 regulars in hitting and
returns at first base. Busby
will be backed up by sophomore
Guy Steuart (.333 in eight
games). Three candidates are
competing for graduated Ben
Bonaventura’s second base spot
including sophomore John
Stagmaier (.174), and freshman
Doug Hassinger, the outstan-
ding first year player in 1977 fall
baseball. Andy Schutrump, a
sophomore who did not make
the team last year, came back
strong this spring and could sur-
prise.

Senior co-captain Ted Hissey
(2.16) is anchoring third base
after playing shortshop for the
previous three years.
Sophomore Pete Restanio (.150)
looks like the leading prospect
to nail down the vacant opening
at short.

Four players have looked pro-
mising in the outfield including
junior co-captain and starting
conterfielder Rich Wiles (.237).
Junior Chuck D’Auria (.161) is
the incumbent in right field with
senior Bob Szezcinski
(.208) and sophomore Dan
Swagert (2.38) fighting it out for
the right field opening.
Szczecinski and Dan Kingman
could alternate at designated
hitter depending on the pitcher.

The 1978 team’s strengths ap-
pear to be at first base and the
outfield. The early season
games will hopefully give need-
ed experience to the young
Generals who could play the
role of the spoiler in the °78
ODAC race.

Weather permitting, the
season opens on Wednesday,
March 15th with an ODAC
doubleheader at Hampden-
Sydney. The team is home on
Smith Field for a conference
doubleheader against Eastern
Mennonite on Saturday, March
18th . -

Lacrosse team loses in éxhibition,

has busy schedule ahead

“‘We improved a great deal in
the Mt. Washington game as
compared to the Duke game,”’
said head W&L coach Jack Em-
mer, ‘‘The team put forth a
good effort and it paid off as we
played Mt. Wasington to the
limit.”” The Generals led 54
with 4:52 to play in the third
quarter before succumbing 8-6
to the Wolfpack. The game is
only an exhibition and does not
count in the team’s overall
record or individual statistics.

This was the eleventh
meeting between the two teams
with defending club champion
Mt. Washington winning all
eleven. It was a close contest
throughout as W&L led 2-1 after
one period with the score tied
4-4 at the half and 5-5 after three
quarters. Mt. Washington pull-
ed away to an 8-5 lead with 8:27
to play and held on for the win.

A balanced scoring effort
kept the Generals in the game

as six different players scored
including one gaol each by at-
tackmen John Black, Jeff Fritz
and Jay Foster. Middies Sandy
McDonald, Roman Kupecky
and John Kemp also tallied for
W&L. Mt. Washington was led
by John Cheek with two goals.
Goalies Bob Clements and
Charlie Brown split time in the
net with Clements making five
saves and Brown 13. Each
allowed 4 goals.

Mt. Washington outshot the
Generals 47-34, and W&L
cleared 27 of 47 while the
Wolfpack was 17 of 31. Mt.
Washington won 11 of 20
faceoffs with the best individual
faceoff effort by W&L coming
from John Hooper who won
seven of eleven.

Emmer and assistant coach
Chuck O’Connell had to be

pleased by the improvement in -

the week since the Duke game.
“The Duke game’s a thing of

the past, it’s all over,” said Em-
mer, “If we played again, we
wouldn’t do anything different.
Conbining the inclement pre-
season weather with our young
and inexperienced team at this
point in the year proved too
much to overcome.”’

The Generals are idle this
week but face four games in ten
days beginning with the home
opener against Ohio State on
March 20th. Game time is 3:00
p.m. on Wilson Field. Following
the Buckeye contest, W&L
hosts perennial college division
power Towson State on March
22nd, at 3:00 p.m., up and com-
ing North Carolina on Marcb
25th at 2:00 p.m., and Virginia
Tech next Wednesday, March
29th at 3:00 p.m.

“We're pointing towards the
week we play Ohio State,
Towson and UNC,” notes the
coach, ‘‘It’s obviously one of our
biggest weeks of the season.
We’re hoping to have each of
our midfields firm by that point
and will expect to have
everybody in the right place at
the right time.”

In W&L’s first two games this
year, Charlie Stieff, Geoff Brent
and George Santos have been
running on the blue midfield,
with Jay Sindler (Player of the
Game vs. Duke), Sandy
McDonald and John Kemp play-
ing on the white midfield. The
gold unit has Joe Olive, Roman
Kupecky, Mark Derbyshire,
and Jerry Broccoli alternating
with Dirk Pieper, Tom Cox and
Mitch Dugan on the green mid-
field.

Sophomore Jay Foster joins
returnees John Black and Jeff
Fritz at attack with Charlie
Brown the starter in goal.
Sophomores Steve Johnson,
Chris Walsh, and freshman Jim
Herbert (Player of Game vs.
Mt. Washington) look to be the
starters at defense for Ohio
State with Bob Williams and

Golfers compete today
in first match of season

Coach Buck Leslie’s golfers,
the nation’s seventh ranked
Division III team in 1977 open
the 1978 season this Thursday
playing Longwood College in
Lexington. The 1977 golfers
finished at 10-1 overall, and in
Leslie’s three years as head
coach have won 34 of 39 mat-
ches.

W&L will again compete for
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference championship, a title
they won in 1977. Bridgewater,

Emory & Henry, Hampden-
Sydney, Lynchburg, Randolph-
Macon and Roanoke will also
compete in conference play.
Medalists play will govern all
ODAC matches with the best
five of six scores counting for
team totals. Leslie was 1977
ODAC Coach of the Year.

Senior captain Jerry Maat-
man (Wilmette, Ill.) returns to
lead the 1978 team. He was an
All-Amercian last season,
W&L’s first ever in golf, when

he finished fifth individually in
the Division III nationals.
Junior Dave Leunig (Louisville,
Ky.) will join Maatman giving
W&L perhaps the best twosome
in the conference. Leunig
was named the ODAC’s Golfer
of the Year in 1977 when he won
the ODAC Tournament with a 36
hole total of 148.

tories for its efforts. W&L was
in this enviable position after
last Friday’s victories over host
Roanoke College and Liberty
Baptist College. W&L outdoor
track, therefore, enters its se-
cond meet of the year Saturday
against Davidson at VMI with a
2-0 record. How long W&L stays
undefeated remains to be seen.

W&L piled up points in both
the track and the field events.
Tri-captain Phil Dunley led the
weightmen with victories in the
shot put and the discus. Paul
Hendry cleared 510” to win the
high jump, and Baker Spring
took second overall in the pole
vault. Due to wet conditions, the
javelin, long jump, and triple
jump events were not com-
peted.

In the track events, W&L
took first in 6 of the ten races.
Tri-captain Jack Norberg and
sophomore Stu Atkinson each
ran identical times to win the
100 meter dash (the only event

run in meters Friday). Norberg
also took the 220 in 22.9 and
placed second overall in the 440
with a 53.0 clocking. Bill Morris
won the 880 yard run, and Chris
Daniels placed second in the
mile. Senior Al Weeks won the
2-mile, coming within 30
seconds of setting a new school
record at that distance. Tri-
captain Norvall Scott was se-
cond overall in the 440 in-
termediate hurdles, and
freshman Jim Vines was second
overall in the 120 high hurdles.
In addition to these solo
achievements, W&L won both
the 440 yard and mile relays.

This Saturday’s meet is
against a Davidson team which
W&L upset last year. This year
W&L will try to repeat that
result. Anyone who is bored
enough Saturday to try
something new could come and
watch the meet, which begins at
11:00 A.M.
Track team goes outside

by Jim Parker

Following a third place finish
in the ODAC indoor track cham-
pionships during Fancy Dress
Weekend, the W&L track team
has been preparing for the up-
coming outdoor track season.

Head track coach Norris
Aldridge admits the team is
young, but has the potential for
a fine season. Coach a
says a lot depends on how the
freshmen and first-time run-
ners and field men (over ten of
them) perform. Aldridge does
look for improvement over the
indoor season.

The culmination of the indoor
track season, the ODAC indoor
track championship at Lyn-
chburg College was, in the
words of Coach Aldridge, disap-
pointing (W&L finished 3rd,
over 40 points behind Lyn-
chburg). However, Aldridge
notes that the team was coming
off February vacation and had
to run the meet on the Saturday
of physically draining Fancy
Dress Weekend. Aldridge ex-
pects the track team to far bet-
ter when the ODAC outdoor
championship occurs in late
April.’

The outdoor track team will
be captained by a runner, a
jumper (primarily), and a
weight man. Jack Norberg, who
is known for being notoriously
late for practice, but also known

fille, Va.) will join Maatman
and Leunig giving W&L a very
solid top four. Last year’s
freshman sensation, Gerry
Barousse is no longer on the
team, and the final two spots
are up for grabs. Seniors Bo
Moorhead (Denver, Colo.) and
Jim Walter (Montgomery,
Ala.) look like the leading can-
didates along with freshmen
Charles Haldi, Bill Hutton,
Kevin McGuire, Bill
Neuenschwander, and Jim
Taylor. Sophomore Tom Wall is
also in the running. Coach
Leslie has been handicapped in
the judging of his men due to the
lack of outside playing time.

The Generals will have more
tourney play in 1978 than usual
competing in the James
Madison Classic on March
25-26, theWilliam & Mary
Classic on April 17-18, and the
ODAC Tournament on April
24th in Staunton. For the first
time, W&L will also field a “‘B”
team this spring which will give
some of the younger players
needed collegiate playing ex-
perience.

for losing his lunch more often
than losing races, leads the run-

ners. Norwall ‘‘(OCAC)”’ Soctt,
who has come within inches of
breaking the school record in
the long jump, is the premier
jumper. Phil Dunley, who won

the shot put at the ODAC’s in-
doors on his final throw, heads
the weightmen. However, these
three captains do not comprise
the total skill of the team.
Especially in the distance runn-
ing events, coached by ex-W&L
runner Stu Nibley, there are
members of the team who are of
the tri-captain caliber.

Coach Aldridge believes the

strongest events for W&L will
be the 440 yard dash, the half-
mile (880 yards), the mile and
the 3-mile, and the long and tri-
ple jump. The 440 relay and
mile relay teams should also be
strong, Aldridge said. The top
runners in the 440 will be
Norberg and Herny Hairston.
Pacing the 880 will be freshman
Bill Morris and Chris Daniel.
The mile should be headed by
Daniel, Rich Bryd and Bob
Bates (Bryd, Daniel, Morris,
and Bill Welch set an ODAC 2-
mile relay record this year in-
doors). The top 3-milers will be
Al Weeks, Johnny Plowden and
Brian Adams. The premier
sprinters (100 yard c and 220
yard dashes) appears to be
Norberg, Stu Atkinson, and
freshman Chris Leiser.
Freshman Jim Vines is the 120
high hurdler and Vines and
Scott will run the 330 in-
termediate hurdles. In most
every event, there are per-
formers who are as talented or
nearly as talented as_ the
aforementioned group.

The same is true in the jump-
ing and weight events.
However, the premier jumpers
will be Scott in the long jump
and Bobby Hoffman in the triple
jump. The top pole vaulters ap-
pear to be Baker Spring and
Bob Campbell, while the best
high jumpers now are Paul
Hendry (who jumped 14’ last
year) and Dave Sheridan. The
shot had ODAC champ Dunley
and Tony Cucci, and Dunley
and Chip Nunley guide the
discus men. The javelin
throwers, who, of course,
couldn’t compete indoors, are
balanced, with two football
players, Jeff Slatcoff and Scott
Swope, and one freshman, John
Schmidt, among their numbers.

Coach Aldridge sees a close
ODAC championship meetout-
doors this year. Last year, the
top 3 teams were separated by
only 15 points. This year could
be as compacted at the top as
last year.

Self-Study report:
Internal Re-examination

Washington and Lee has com-
pleted its preliminary Self-
Study report — a joint effort
that involved participation over
the. past eight years from
students, the faculty, the ad-
ministration and the board of
trustees, leading to a 310-page
analysis, just published, with
117 separate recommendations
for action or continued in-
vestigation.

A ‘“‘self-study” is required
once a decade by the Southern
Association of Colleges and
Schools, the agency which ac-
credits colleges in the region.
The 1978 Self-Study Report was
prepared by Frank A. Parsons,
assistant to the president, with
the cooperation of the entire
university community. Parsons
was the editor of the 1964-66
Self-Study also.

In large measure, according
to Parsons, the 1978 Self-Study
at W&L is the result of the con-
tinuing evaluation of the univer-
sity’s goals and programs that
has occurred over the past
decade in connection with the
‘Development Program for the
Decade of the 1970s.”’

Among the principal
elements of the
new Self-Study are the re-
evaluation of the W&L
undergraduate curriculum,
which in 1970 led to adoption of
the 12-week/12-week/12-week
term system and the change in
distribution requirements; the
separate coeducation studies
which led to decisions to admit

women to the law school but to
remain all-male at the

undergraduate level; establish-
ment of academic goals and
priorities for each
undergraduate department;

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Two months ago, we applauded the end of the con-
troversy between the Student Music Union and the
Cockpit. But in light of the resignation of Galen
Trussell from the chairmanship of the SMU, our
speculation appears to have been more along the line
of wishful thinking. Trussell cited his difficulty in
dealing with Cockpit manager Dan Scott as a stumbl-
ing block between the SMU and the Cockpit relation-
ship. Scott told Trussell that he has the power to veto
all entertainment in the Cockpit, and that he has been
empowered to charge a cover without consulting the
student Executive Committee.

Student funded entertainment should not be af-
fected by the whimsical autocratic decision of the
Cockpit’s manager. Free entertainment for the
Cockpit is a gift from the students for the students,
payed for by the students. If our memory serves us
correctly, nothing is written which specifies that Stu-
dent Music Union entertainment has to be held in the
Cockpit.

There are many similar establishments in town
that would jump at the chance for free entertainment.
They might also consider lowering competitive beer
prices to further enhance their establishments to at-
tract student patronage. In addition, moving SMU
entertainment in town might help inprove relations
between the townspeople and the college students.
The time has come for the new Music Union leader-
ship to consider moving student funded entertain-
ment from a hostile atmosphere to a friendly one.

For the 1526 who didn’t know where I was last week,
I was running for student body president. To the

faithful 177 who knew, many thanks. I feel like -

Leonidas at Thermopylae with his faithful 300 Spar-
tans. Both causes were worth fighting for , but 300
Spartans. Both causes were worth fighting for, but
remember, ‘‘This time it matters’.

‘This time”’ the campaign trail was long and hard.
I am truly sorry I didn’t have a chance to barnstorm
at the Phi Kap and SAE hous’ houses. I know the guys
out there were itching to hear my philosophies again,
but I knew I could count on their votes and I wanted to
hit other frats which weren’t so dependable. It did
something to me to see both the entire houses mar-
ching down to the polls in formation singing ‘“Yes, my
pap was a Phi Kap”’ and ‘‘Half the world is...”’

This was the first campaign that was actually car-
ried to the law school, and they were ready for us. The
enthusiasm and intelligence they used to judged the
candidates was to be expected. The huge turnout for
the law school campaign speeches was admirable.
The law students obviously put as much thought into
the election as the undergraduates. The accusation
that the law students would vote for Dudley just
because he was one of their own is unfounded. Sure,
he received 80 percent of the law school vote, but ap-
parently they liked his campaign and platform

So congratulations to the three winners. Waller
‘‘Beau Dudley brings his steadfast, unshakeable, and
never yielding strong stand on the issues to the office
of president. He is sure to make the right decisions
next year and will use his level-headedness and unof-
fensive natur to do it. No one needs to worry with
Beau in the driver’s seat. Bill ‘‘Censorship’’ Tucker
(his friends call him ‘honest SAB’’) is an opponent of
secrecy in government and supports openness and
honesty as has been evidenced by his job on the SAB
this year. Tucker also supports the free press and has
promised to do his utmost to see the RtP unhindered
in its investigative pursuits. McCarthy, as has
already been mentioned in in the RtP, will do a good
job.

With such capable men representing the student
body next year there is no need to fear the inevitable
‘“‘dark cloud of Mordor’’. They will do their best to
fend off any attacks of extreme liberalism and any
change which could be interpreted as radically in-
novative will be wisely cast aside. Their good sense
will govern them, and they, will govern us.

LETTERS TO EDITOR |

Responses to editorial outcry

speak out on RtP

Students

Dear Editor:

I’m so glad that someone has
finally decided to put you and
your conspiring cohorts in their
rightful places. Bill Tucker,
famed SAB chairman and now
vice-president of the student
body, has taken it upon himself
to do away with the first amend-
ment and take away your
freedom of speech. Well, I say
bully to that, right on Bill, Sieg
Heil, and all that stuff.

Big Bill contends that the
RTP is a perfect example of
shabby, irresponsible jour-
nalism, and I couldn’t agree
with him more. Look at what
this paper prints — the truth,
how inexcusable! It exposes
corruption, stupidity, in-
competency, all the qualities
that make our student organiza-
tions so great. This is the kind of
reporting that past RTPs never
had the courage or the convic-
tion to attempt, but I say bring
back the sniveling cowards,
they never get anybody upset
anyway. Gallagher, Howard,
Barnes, have you no feelings,
“have you no sense of common
decency left?”’

Honest Bill instead wants the
RTP to reflect the collective
opinions of the student body and
print that in the paper instead of
the opinions of a few flaming
liberals who want to change
what’s wrong with the system
and not just be middle-of-the-
road, do-nothing meatheads.
It’s obvious to me that Mr.
Tucker is in the right here.
Wouldn’t you rather read the
journalistic endeavors of a
group of peabrains than in-
telligent, gutsy reporting? I
would.

It’s time the RTP learned its
lesson and with Mr. Tucker in
such power, I can see this paper,
becoming what all papers
become when freedom is
abolished — propaganda. In the
futute I can see the RTP espous-
ing the glories of the SAB, the
saintlihood of Charlie Hulfish,
and the innocence of fraternity
life. Right on again Bill, power
to the proletariat, workers

unite, down with the
bourgeoisie. With a philosophy
such as this, arent’ you glad you
voted for Bill Tucker, don’t you

wish everybody else did?
Sincerely yours,
Nikolai L.
Mr. Editor:

After due consideration, I’ve
decided to write this letter in
the hope of making some con-
structive criticism of the paper,
and also for the purpose of mak-
ing some suggestions for the
general improvement of the
Ring-tum Phi’s quality. First of
all, let me state that I believe
that this paper has served a
useful purpose in making the
student body more aware of
W&L community matters. Past
papers have been more famous
for their ‘‘press_ release’
framework, in which the major
source of interest seemed to be
the size of the latest alumni
donation. This year’s Ring-tum
Phi, however, has given a
broader perspective of the
school, with articles ranging
from EC actions to the need for
a fraternity co-op for food pur-
chasing. Also, the range of
feature articles on entertain-
ment opportunities, bookstore
and record shop specials, and
surrounding social conditions,
have kept me informed and
amused.

The paper’s weaknesses,
however, are obvious and have
received their due attention.
Stories are sometimes _in-
complete, distorted, uncor-
roborated, or taken out of con-
text. Some of the blame natural-
ly lies on the newspaper staff.
By and large, though, the
reporters are a hardworking,
largely unappreciated group
who’ve been unfairly criticized
for paper weaknesses over
which they have little or no con-
trol. In particular, I’m referr-
ing to the fact that the W&L stu-
dent body does not support the
paper. The staff’s size is appall-
ingly small, and _ several
members are forced to write 2
or more articles per issue. Con-
sidering the fact that these
students also have academic
responsibilities, I find that the
work they do accomplish is
quite satisfactory. Also, it must
be remembered that most of the
students who work on the paper
are not experienced journalists,
and therefore their articles
quite naturally will be a bit rag-
ged around the edges.

What does bother me, though,
is the lack of student interest in
the paper. Though many
students freely criticize the
paper, few are willing to try to
improve it by hitching on the

staff. Personally, I think that
the paper provides an ideal op-
portunity for the budding young
journalist, a concerned student,
or a light-hearted comic to get
their word across. After all, the
name of the game is com-
munication, and a_ college
newspaper is probably one of
the freest forums available. As
a reporter, your only duty is to
yourself and to the truth, and in
this world, with its constant
concern for apperances, there
aren’t too many places where
you can Say that.

So, I would like to see more
student involvement on the
newspaper, and perhaps also
some advice or help from the
Journalism school. Since their
business is the media, I’m sure
any help would be _ well-
received. An arrangement
might even be set up by which
students could obtain credit by
working on the paper, in
cooperation with the Jour-
nalism department’s courses.

Well, I’ve said about all I’ve
had to say, and I appreciate the
opportunity to say it. In most
countries, such free speech is
not permitted. Think about it.

Yours Respectfully,
Robert Sartelle ‘79

New pres.

says thanks

To the W&L Community:

At the risk of understating
things, I was extremely pleased
by the results of the Student
Body Elections. It was very
gratifying to receive such a
margin, and perhaps more im-
portantly to see almost 70 per-
cent of us go to the polls. That is
a clear indication to me that we
all realize the importance of the
Executive Committee, and I
will do my best to uphold the
trust you have given me.
Thanks so much to all of you
who worked for me and turned
out the vote on Monday. I hope
that at this time next year we

can say that W&L is a bit

stronger and closer for your ef-
forts.

Sincerely,

Beau Dudley

bothered
by pests

To the Editor:

Since coming to W&L in
September, my room and all the
others on the first floor of Davis
dorm have been infested with
silverfish. I have put up with
these pests for long enough! I
am sick and tired of having to
chase these vermin around my
room. I would like to know if
these rooms have been exter-
minated? and if not why? This
problem should be taken care
of, after all it is hard enough for
two people to live together in a
small room without having to
contend with the silverfish too.
The Administration’s attention
to this problem would be great-
ly appreciated.

Steven M. Everett ‘81

Dear Editor:

I am writing this letter ex-
hausted with scattered silver-
fish remains on the soles of my
feet. For the past ten minutes I
have unsuccessfully attacked
the hordes of silverfish that in-
fest our hall. This is not only a
nuisance but a vile health viola-
tion and I find it astounding that
these rooms have not been
fumigated. I find it a gross ig-
norance and can’t believe the
Administration’s apparent
disconcern for the student’s liv-
ing conditions. I paid $525 to live
in Davis dorm for this year and
didn’t expect to be placed in a
vermin infested dump. I hope
this problem can be (ex)ter-
minated!

James J. Duplessie
Class of 1981

by Robert Boardman Tremblay

It was a night spent with the
masters Saturday night at
Jackson Hall. In attendance
were two of the leading French
Impressionistic composers,
Dukas and Debussy as well as
two of the leading German
Romantic composers,
Mendelssohn and Brahms.
Their music and its per-
formance by the Rockbridge
Orchestra and Chorus was in-
deed exciting.

The concert began with the
music of Dukas, a composer
famous for the highly popular
“‘Sorcerer’s Apprentice,” but
Saturday night the fanfare from
his ballet “La Peri” was per-
formed. This piece was arrang-
ed for brass and tympani and
the playing throughout was
crisp, and in the tradition of the
fanfare, boisterous and arous-
ing, a perfect opening for the
other fine music that was to
follow.

The Romanticism of Felix
Mendelssohn was next. This
composer of immense genius
died tragically young, but still
managed to compose many
masterpieces and his Sym-
phony No. 4 , ’The Italian,” is
one of them. Mendelssohn’s
music lacks the pathos of most
Romantic music and instead
looks to the style of J. S. Bach
for influence, and the many
complex fugues that appear in
Mendelssohn attest to this fact.
Also apparent in his style is a
classical clarity and control
that contemporaries such as
Berlioz seldom displayed. All
these characteristics as well as
Mendelssohn’s' puckish
melodies were brought out
splendidly by the Rockbridge
Orchestra under the baton of
Professor Stewart. The first
movement features some tricky
woodwind passages, the third
movement some devilish horn
writing especially in the trio’
and the fourth movement a
quick rhythmic figure that
highlights the saltarello, and

though not all of these sections
were played immaculately, the
performance was lively and
captured the lyrical, emotional
flavor of Italy that Mendelssohn
no doubt found so fascinating on
his visit there.

The ethereal, Oriental
flavored music of Debussy
followed the Mendelssohn —
Noctures: ‘‘Nuages and Fetes’.
And its whole tone

dominated scales offered an in-
teresting contract to the
diatonic patterns of the German
master. The playing of this
piece was truly exceptional
with a lovely English horn solo
included. The melancholy tonal
qualities of this instrument
have really never been ex-
ploited enough, with this piece

ed amendment ratified. The
Virginia Senate has since killed
ratification in Virginia for the
sixth year in a row.

Another issue on which the
Democrats took a_ clearlv-
defined stand was in their sup-
port of Allen Bakke’s contention
that he was the victim of
reverse discrimination.
Seventy-two percent of the
members said they think it was
wrong for Bakke to be derpved
of going to medical school
despite having a_ better
academic record than a black
who was admitted to the same
medical school. Eighteen per-
cent said they believe
minorities deserve special con-
sideration.

Seventy-one percent of the
members said they favor the
proposed Panama Canal Trea-
ty. The treaty, which would
gradually give Panama control
over the canal by the year 2000,
was disapproved of by 16 per-
cent of the members. Thirteen
percent were undecided.

More hotly contested issues
were: the reinstatement of
capital punishment, the
deregulation of natural gas and
coeducation for Washington and
Lee.

Coeducation was voted down
by YD member 56 to 41 percent.
Earlier in the year a coeduca-
tion poll administered to the en-
tire student body by the Ring-

tum Phi indicated 56 percent of
the student body was in favor of
coeducation. Coeducation was
most recently voted down by
theBoard of Trustees in
February, 1976.

A slim majority of YD
members favored capital
punishment. Forty-six percent
of the members said they
favored reinstituting the’ death
penalty, while 44 percent were
opposed.

Deregulation of natural gas
was also voted down by a small
margin. Thirty-eight percent of
the Democrats were opposed to
deregulation of natural gas,
while 36 percent thought it
would be a good idea. A large
group of students, 26 percent
did not express an opinion.
Deregulation of natural gas
would have the effect of raising
gas prices to level more
realistic in terms of demand
and supply characteristics of
the market.

The poll also touched on the
subject of the neutron bomb.
Thirty-nine percent of the YDs
polled favored production of the
bomb, while 43 percent disap-
proved of production. Eighteen
percent of the members
surveyed did not have an opi-
nion on the bomb which is
designed to kill people with
deadly radiation while leaving
buildings standing.

Another approach in order for next Ariel

by Parker Potter

The working concept behind
this article is ‘perhaps another
approach is in order.” As editor
of Ariel, I find myself in an
curious position. Somehwere
deep in the bowels of
Washington Hall in the magic
money place, there is a little
treasure chest with Ariel’s
name on it. That little chest con-
tains more than enough
dabloons to publish another
Ariel like the first one.

As well I have maintained on
several occasions that I would
indeed publish two Ariels.
There is only one variable lack-
ing in the equation. That is the
aspect over which I have the
leat control, the volume of stu-
dent contributions. I can’t
publish what I don’t have.

Perhaps another approach is
in order. There are several
possibilities. I could abandon
my plans to publish a second
Ariel. This is no_ solution
because I remain convinced

that there resides much un-
tappe talent in the W&L com-

munity capable of writing fully
accepted and _ worthwhile
creative pieces.

Convinced as I am of the real
need for a second Ariel, I could

exercise my _ editorial
perogative and sit down and
crank out a _ bunch of

“literature” and fill an Ariel. I
certainly don’t want to do that
and you certainly don’t want to
read that.

What is needed is a new and
fresh way of enticing student

writers to submit to Ariel.
Realizing that I write more and
better things when I have a
reason to write, my cronies and
I have some up with a two pro-
nged solution to the present
death contributions.

First, we are going to attempt
to put together a dramatic sec-
tion in Ariel. That is to say we
are going to attempt to string
together several pieces dealing
in different ways with different
sides of a particular idea or
question. Our two working ideas
we have are as follows:

 

 

Harriet Thomas.

The Alexander-Withrow House
3 West Washington Street
Antique Shop & Country Inn

A restored historic landmark with five period-furnished guest suites
AAA and COUNTRY INNS AND BACK ROADS. A different
experience in overnight hospitality for those who love fine things.
Students may make reservations for their parents and tour the
house from 10-5 daily. Wednesday until 2:00 or write Mrs.

 

One idea was a group of
works which deal primarily
with a particular geographical
region or place. That is not to
suggest a bunch of pieces all
about the same place but rather
a collection of essentially

geographically oriented pieces.

 

That would include impressions
or descriptions of various
places as well as narratives
whose action is determined by
virtue of a particular setting.
Another thematic suggestion
was based upon the outpouring

Construction progresses smoothly but new library holds surprises

for students.

Library

 

Students to move books

by Jim Lynn

“The main concern we have
is to involve the entire student
body and faculty in the move-
ment of the library from the
current building to the new
structure,’’ Maurice Leach
said.

With this statement, Leach,
the head librarian, has isolated
the one aspect of the new
library which has remained
with the project since the first
planning meetings in the fall of
1968. That committee wrote the
building program and was com-
posed of students, faculty and
administration. The commit-
tee’s main objective was to see
that the entire campus be con-
cerned and involved in the plan-
nings and workings of the $9.26
million structure.

For this reason, Leach wants
the students to actually move
the books after the new building
is ready for occupancy.

“IT want the students and
faculty to have a vested interest
in what should be the center, or
hub, of intellectual and cultural
activity on the campus,’’ he
said.

The actual movement is plan-
ned for an undertermined time
between December 15 and
January 3 of the next school
year, Leach said. The school
has hired a moving consultant
who has suggested two means
of possible action.

The consultant’s first sugges-
tion is similar to Leach’s pro-
posal. Eight lines of students
would pick up approximately
one foot of books from eight
locations in McCormick and
walk them over to the new
building. Portions of the com-
merce and biology libraries will
also become part of the new
library.

The other approach that the
consultant suggested was to use
four forklifts to move larger
boxes of books.

Leach said that the method of
using students would take one
day while the school would have
to wait nine days for the
forklifts to make the move.

The furniture that is in the
library now would be moved in
one week no matter what means
are used to move the books,
Leach said.

The final decision on what
system will be used has yet to
be made, however.

McCormick Library now
houses approximately 175,000
volumes, and the new library

#z¢te

will have a capacity of 500,000
volumes. Most definately,
Leach said, the new facility will
be spacious and un-cluttered.

The library will be able to
seat 800 students which is 425
more than the current structure
can accommodate.

The 130,000 square-foot facili-
ty will be the largest structure
on the campus. But its five
stories will in no way loom over
the other buildings on the hill.
Because it is being built on the
slope over Wood’s Creek, the
library will actually be on the
same level as the other
buildings on campus.

The rear of the building will
have many windows to take ad-
vantage of the panoramic view
of the mountains.

One of the more impressive
sights that the student will see
upon entering the library will be
the front lobby. This spacious
and comfortable room will lead
to an auditorium, and at the
right of the lobby will be a large
stairwell to the second floor.
This floor will also have two
elevators.

The main floor will have a cir-
culation desk opposite the
stairwell and the reference
library behind the lobby. The
reference library offices will be
in the middle of that room.

Due to the size of the struc-
ture, rather than have students
travel the entire building in
search of assistance, there will
be an intercom system
throughout the building that
will be connected to the circula-
tion desk on the main floor.

At the end of the reference
wing will be an area specifically

(continued on page 12)

Referendum falls short

favored only 565-441, or 54-46
percent.

EC members pointed out that
the law school voted 200-10 for
extra law school representa-
tion, but only 128-101 for more
freshman representation. That
would seem to account for the
discrepancy between the two
amendment votes. And, as Jim
Underhill said, it would seem to
indicate the law school was only
interested in extra representa-
tion for itself, not in an abstract
argument for fair representa-
tion of all classes.
Undergraduate indignation at
this seeming hyprocrisy
underlay much of the discussion
on whether voting on the
amendment should be extended
another day.

Underhill began the discus-
sion on extending voting by say-
ing he thought keeping the vote
open “would distort what is a
pretty accurate reflection of
student opinion.’’ He expressed
his concern that the law school
would turn out its 60 or 70
students who did not vote on the
amendment, Monday, while
undergraduates would lose in-
terest in the issue because it did
not bear on them directly. He
Said that would tend to distort
student opinion.

Tom Healy, upperclass law
representative, responded that
turning out the vote is part of
any political action. He said by
having more students vote, it
would more conclusively reflect
student opinion. Speaking about
the vote he said, ‘‘Right now it’s
accurate but inconclusive.”

Jackie Boyden added, ‘‘With a
margin that close, it’s only right
to keep it open.”’

Although it was mentioned
only briefly, undergraduate EC
representatives seemed to
dislike the idea of another law
representative in light of the re-
cent election of rising third year
law student Beau Dudley as stu-
dent body president. Senior EC
representative Mike Missal
said he would not have voted for
the measure had he known
Dudley was going to be elected.

When the motion to extend
voting on the referenda to
Wednesday was voted on, only
Boyden, Healy, Underhill and
Griffin voted for it. Andy
Bodenstab, Missal, Doug
Perkins, Chris Gammon, Jack
Bovay, Jim Davis and Steve
Abraham voted against it.
Underhill’s support of the
measure was particularly sur-

Book that would have allowed
someone to reapply to W&L
after being convicted of an
honor offense. The proposed
amendment stipulated that at
the time of an honor conviction,
a student could ask for readmit-
tance to the University. At that
time the Executive Committee
would decide when and if a stu-
dent could reapply. However, 57
percent of the voting, voted to
retain the single penalty option.
That penalty is total banish-

Honor Code changes

(continued from page 1)

Graduated Penalties

The law school’s recommen-
dation that a convicted honor of-
fender be permitted to reapply
for admission to Washington
and Lee—after a certain time
period based on EC approval—
was subject to an extended
discussion Monday night.

EC law school representative
Tom Healy argued that a choice:
of penalties would make the
honor system “more flexible.”
He said that an honor trial
should be a two-step process:
(1) is he guilty? and (2) has his
conduct been so reprehensible
that he should be forced to leave
school?

Supporters of the law school
proposal said they were in favor
of a single sanction, but wanted
a less severe penalty to make
the honor system more adop-
table to the varying cir-
cumstances of individual cases.

Doug Perkins, senior EC
representative, pointed out that
the undergraduates had re-
jected the graduated penalty
proposal in Monday’s referen-

dum vote by a margin of |

roughly two-to-one.

Executive Committee presi-
dent Jim Underhill outlined pro-
cedural complications with the
optional penalties. In a public
trial, the defendant would have
to be found guilty first, and then
go through another hearing to
determine the penalty, he said.

University President R.E.R.
Huntley ‘‘said we don’t have the

authority to make that
change,’’ Underhill added. The
EC could, however, make a
recommendation to the Board
of Trustees, but only the
Trustees can change school

’ policy so a convicted honor

violator can apply for readmis-
sion to W&L. When put to a

vote, the law school fell short, .

losing by one vote. In favor of
the graduated penalty were:
Healy, Perkins, Mike Missal,
George Griffin, and Jackie
Boyden. Opposed to the law
school proposal’ were:
Underhill, Jim Davis, Steve
Abraham, Jack Bovay, Chris
Gammon, and Andy Bodenstab.
Neil Pentifallo was absent.

Investigators

Passed by the EC was a pro-
posal which allows two “ran-
domly” selected EC members
and one student to conduct the
pre-trial investigation of a
reported honor violation. It was
specified that the student in-
vestigator would come from the
same ‘‘school’’ as the accused

(i.e. commerce school, law
school, school of arts, and
school of sciences).

If any two of the three in-:

vestigators feel that there is
sufficient evidence of a possible
honor violation, the EC will go
to trial on the case to determine
guilt or innocence. The proposal
passed, 9-2.

Conviction
The EC voted to retain its cur-
rent two-thirds vote of

members present for conviction
of an honor offense. The law
school had recommended that
the EC raise the margin to a
three-quarters guilty vote.

Ray Laven, a member of the
SBA subcommittee that drew
up the honor code changes, said
that ‘‘in light of the single sanc-
tion, I think we have to consider
a three-quarters vote for con-
viction.”’

Jackie Boyden, EC law school
representative, added that the
three-quarters vote was
necessary because of the
“severity of the sanction.”’

    
  
  
   

The undergraduate EC
members argued that the honor
system was difficult enough to
maintain with the two-thirds
guilty vote. If EC members
were unable to attend an honor
trial and the margin required to
convict was .a_ three-quarter
vote, ‘it would make the
system a joke.”’

During the course of the
debate on the three-quarters
proposal, it was revealed that
the law school had expected to
receive an additional EC
representative, expanding the
membership of the Executive
Committee.

The proposal that a three-
quarters vote of EC members
attending an honor trial vote
guilty to render a verdict of

guilty failed, 7-4. In favor of the
proposal were: Boyden, Healy,
Davis, and Gammon. Opposed
to the motion were: Perkins,
Bovay, Underhill, Missal, Grif-
fin, Abraham, and Bodenstab.

clarifications:

—Underhill clarified the com-
plications of a convicted honor
violator remaining on campus.
“The administration will take
care of that; it is their respon-
sibility.”

—Beau Dudley, newly elected
EC president, lobbied for ad-
visors to question witnesses
directly; the accused should
give his own testimony, he said.
The proposal including this
charge was passed by the EC.

Rockbridge

concert

(continued from page 9)
Dvorak’s ‘‘New World Sym-
phony” the only famous works
that come to mind which effec-
tively emphasize this member
of the oboe family.

The lush, beautiful sonorities
of one of music’s greatest com-
posers, Johannes Brahms, con-
tinued the program after a
short break for the stage to be
prepared for the Rockbridge
Chorus. This ensemble, under
the direction of Professor Spice,
was obviously in good voice for
Saturday’s night’s concert.
Their singing of the Four A
Capella Songs Op. 62 was
superbly balanced, though I
was slightly partial to the lovely
soprano voices. The tenors and
the basses shined in the Three
Songs also by Brahms, who
along with Schubert,
Schumann, Wolf, and Mahler,
was one of the greatest com-
posers of Romantic lieder, and

after listening to Saturday
night’s program, it’s easy to
hear why.

The concert concluded with
the Rockbridge Orchestra join-
ing the Chorus in a performance
of Brahms’ Nenia Op. 82. This
work is ultra-Romantic and
both the orchestra and the
chorus under the direction of
Professor Spice captured the
piece’s somber, elegiac quality
as well.

One cannot emphasize
enough the accomplishment of
this group of musicians, con-
sisting mostly of law, college
and high school students,
teachers, wives of teachers, and
of course Rockbridge county
residents. None of these per-
formers are professionals, and
the success of this concert and
other concerts is due largely to
a great deal of hard work on
their part and on the parts of
Professors Spice and Stewart.
Of course, talent is there, but
without a dedicated effort, it is
never fully realized. Saturday
night’s concert proved what a
‘little’ dedication can do.

Library movement planned

(continued from page 10)

for audio-visual aides. Also on
this floor will be a browsing
room which will display the
library’s new books. There will
be an open lounge area which
will contain all of the recent edi-
tions of periodicals.

The first lower level will have
a rare book room which Leach
hopes to give a “‘club’’ at-
mosphere. Next to this will be a
rare book work room and desks
for visiting scholars. This level
will also have a vault for rare
books.

In another part of the floor
will be two seminar rooms
which will hold 20 people. Both
rooms, like many other rooms
in the building, will be wired for
television. This floor also has
four smaller conference rooms.

This floor will havemany of
the 560 study carrels that willbe
placed throughout the building.

There also will be 31 locked
studies for faculty members
and students doing work on
honors papers, Leach said.

He emphasized that the facili-
ty will be spacious and com-
fortable, and to aid in that
cause, many lounge chairs will
be on all levels.

The other lower levels will
have conference rooms, book
stacks, and study lounges for
smokers.

The library auditorium will
hold 100 people and will not be a
fixed permanent structure like
the DuPont auditorium. The
floor will be flat, and the chairs
will be movable so that the
room can be used for a large ex-
hibit. There will be a stage and
screen for speakers and visual
displays.

Leach said that the new
library will be fully carpeted,

   

oo

*

sound proof and open for use 24
hours a day, all week long.

To avoid confusion over the
location of books, each floor will
be color-coded to aid students in
located a certain department or
book.

Leach is anxious to see the
library completed so that it can
properly complete’ the
Washington and Lee campus,
culturally as well as physically.

Seven fraternities join block

 

‘Red Square Machine” Exposed

by Randy Smith
The Interfraternity Council
voted to remove one member of
the recently elected Judicial
Board and accepted the
resignation of another in
response to a voting conflict in
last week’s IFC election.
Madison Spencer (Sigma
Nu), elected last week as Senior
Justice, was removed from that
office, and Biff Martin (Delta
Tau Delta) resigned as one of
the Junior Justices.
The conflict arose out of the
formation of an apparent voting

‘machine’ structure among
seven fraternities, or‘anized
before the election.

“The president of the Delt
house was contacted that our
house’s votes would assure his
elected position to the Judicial
Board at last Tuesday’s IFC
election,’’ said Bill
Thistlethwaite, IFC represen-
tative for Delta Tau Delta.

Thistlethwaite further charg-
ed that the president, Biff Mar-

tin, joined into the voting block
“without notifying any member
of the house”’ or the fraternity’s
IFC representative.

Because Thistlethwaite did
not know a political deal had
been made, Martin ‘‘was allow-
ed to vote on one of the ballots in
the election,” the IFC represen-
tative explained. ‘‘Once I realiz-
ed what was going on and that
this was a pre-planned pro-
cedure, I cast the house’s vote
for the candidate I felt most
qualified,”’ he continued.

The deal was made with what
is reportedly called the ‘Red
Square Machine.”’ Represen-
tatives from Phi Kappa Sigma,
Beta Theta Pi, Phi Delta Theta,
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon allow-
ed candidates from Kappa
Alpha, Sigma Nu, and Delta
Tau Delta to join their already
established ‘‘block’’ in return
for their pledge of support for
the other machine candidates.

The ‘‘Red Square Machine”

was apparently successful, cap-

Admissions Still Down;
Trustees Interviewed

On March 16-18th the Board of
Trustees held their winter
meeting postponed in last

February because of inclement

weather in Lexington and all over
the East coast. After their final
session on Saturday Mr. S. L.
Kopald, '43 and Dr. Edgar F.
Shannon, Jr., 39 graciously con-
sented to be interviewed by the
Ring-tum Phi on the issues that
face the University. The follow-
ing is a transcript of the
highlights of that conversation.
In response. to questions on
the admissions program Mr.
Kopald admitted that as of that
date applications for admission
were r. unning 24 percent below
the normal rate. Both
gentlemen said that the Board
was concerned over this
development, but at the same
time was confident that it is not
indicative of a trend. Kopald
said, ‘“‘We’ve got to do a better
job to communicate the

academic excellence of this |

university.’’ Dr. Shannon was
hopeful that the selection of two
undergraduates (Messers.
Underhill and Putney, Phi,
3/23/78) to work in the admis-
sions department next year cer-
tainly would “strengthen that
department, Mr. Kopald did not
rule out the possibility of an out-
side agency being brought in to
assess the admissions program
and make recommendations on
its effectiveness.

Dr. Shannon said that com-
peting with the ‘best schools in
the South, and the country’
we've got to reach more kids in

high schools. I think our own
students are the best device we
have for accomplishing this.”’

Neither of Board members
would concede that coeducation
was a reason for the drop in ad-
missions. Mr. Shannon said, ‘“‘If
we suddenly admit women, I
don’t think applications for ad-
mission would dramatically
rise. Wben the Board made the
decision not to go co-ed (a
unanimous one) it did so
because it felt the quality of the
institution was _ strong.”’
However both Board members
indicated that if a point in time
comes when the Board believes
that the quality of W&L was not
strong, they might re-examine
the question of co-education. If
admission of women would im-
prove the quality of W&L,
Shannon and. Kopald both
believe that this would be an
“overwhelming” factor in favor
of co-education. In closing
Shannon said that since there
evidence to this hypothesis,
neither the board nor the ad-
ministration should look in to
the question of co-education.

In response to a question
about the need to recruit more
minorities to come to W&L, Mr.
Kopald said, ‘I can’t think of
anything that would please the
board more than getting more
black faculty and students to
come to Washington and Lee.
We have a much higher priority
on getting minorities than look-
ing into co-education.”’

Both gentlemen were in

(continued on page 8)

turing six of seven IFC elected
seats last Tuesday night.

However, the deal caused
quite an uproar at the Delt
house. Martin made the deal to
give all the Delt votes to the
machine candidates in return
for his position on the ticket
without informing any of his
fraternity brothers or the IFC
representative.

Elections
by Lee Howard

Yesterday’s voting for class
officers featured many upsets,
with five candidates who had
fallen behind in the ballotting on
Monday pulling out victories
over their previously more suc-
cessfulopponents.  .

The chief of the underdogs
was freshman Jay Stewart, who
had been taken off the ballot for
sophomore class vice president
after finishing third on Monday,
only to win the office on a strong
write-in campaign.

Another surprising winner
was William Mackie, who
finished 24 votes behind incum-

SAB Movies
Shut Down
by Gordon

by Randy Smith -

Films scheduled by the Stu-
dent Activities Board can no
longer be shown in the duPont
auditorium Bill Tucker, chair-
man of the SAB, revealed at
Monday’s Executive Commit-
tee meeting.

The trash problem of empty
beer cans left after the weekend
movie showings was the cause
for the loss of the SAB’s movie
privilege, Tucker said.

Prof. Albert C. Gordon of the
Fine Arts Department had com-
plained about the beer can trash
problem all year, Tucker said,
but last weekend was worse
than it has been in the past.

Jim Underhill, EC president,
offered the Executive Commit-
tee’s help in solving the SAB’s
problem of where to show the
movies which have been
ordered for the remainder of
the school year.

Meanwhile, everyone on the

SAB Spring Concert
Still Up In The Air

Michael Murphy seems to be
the only ‘‘strong”’ possibility as
a performer at this year’s spr-
ing concert, according to Stu-
dent Activities Board informa-
tion available last night.

Bill Tucker, chairman of the
SAB, and his committee have
run into numerous complica-
tions in arranging the concert.
“Right now we have to start all

SAB to perform with Michael
Murphy. Tucker learned late
last night that The Outlaws had
been offered television ex-
posure at the Kentucky Derby
and would be unavailable for
the proposed early May concert
date at W&L. :

The Charlie Daniels Band had
been a possibility earlier in the
week, but their stage show pos-
ed many complications for the
SAB.

Tucker said that the Charlie
Daniels Band required 400
amps..to put on their show. The
gym only has 200 amps.
available so outside power
would have to be brought in.
‘‘Their show would have been
very expensive,” said Tucker
who estimated the cost of their
show to be over $17,000.

been a choice, but Tucker said

For five Washington and Lee
seamadarila business ad-

ministration majors, playing a
game 30 hours a week for nine
weeks has paid off.

The game was on a computer,
and the students took it 100-

ercent seriously. It was the an-

ual Emory University Inter-
collegiate Business Game, and
the result of the W&L students’
work was a first-place victory
in the consumer-electronics
segment of the computer-
simulated ‘‘economy.”

The five W&L men operated
an imaginary company called
Innovative Consumer Elec-
tronics (ICE). They produced
and distributed smoke detec-
tors ina market controlled by a
master computer at Emory in
Atlanta.

The officers of ICE were all
senior undergraduates at W&L.
Charles Hinkle was president of
the firm; Jerry Baird was vice
president in charge of
marketing; Jeffrey Sone was
sales manager; Robert Peery
was corporate accountant, and
Howard Rubel was in charge of
production. They were advised
by Dr. Joseph Goldsten,
associate professor of ad-
ministration.

ICE competed against 24
other teams, which were divid-
ed into different industries.
Each team had to guide its com-
pany through three years of
business activity regulated by
the computer.

 

The computer threw some
curve balls at the W&L team.

ICE’s products was declared il-
legal, and the W&L company
had to modify it at a cost of

 

Early in the competition one of

C-schoolers play games

$50,000. The computer also
blocked an attempt to buy out a
competitor, an important part
of the W&L strategy.

Despite the computer’s
repeated attempts to thwart the
progress of the W&L team, ICE
stayed in the black and earned a
tidy sum of its make-believe
stockholders.

The students operated their
companies by __ teletyping
management decisions twice a
week to the Emory computer.
The computer analyzed the
decisions and results were
teletyped back to each com-
peting team.

The student teams and their
advisors met in Atlanta in
March to compare their final
profits and to be judged on
game play, presentations of
business strategy and
stockholders’ reports.

Winners were decided by a
panel of men and women from
sponsoring businesses, business
school faculty and graduate
students.

An important factor in
W&L’s divisional victory was a
presentation they made to a
group of businessmen gathered
at Emory to evaluate the efforts
of the competing teams. Hinkle
said the W&L students had
predicted every question they
were asked.

Hinkle credited the teaas
preparedness to the broad
background in business they
received at W&L. He said they
were taught to deal with pro-
blems in marketing, finance
and general business practices
as well as in other areas of
business. Class time spent on
case studies also helped the
team win, he said.

 

 

Marston Says Carter Lied
Four Times About Firing

by Ken Mastrilli

“Anytime a President who
said he would never lie to us can
get up and lie at a press con-
ference four times in 10
minutes, and then say he would
do it again if he had to, then
something’s wrong,’’ said
David Marston who was fired
from his U.S. attorney’s job in
Philadelphia last Philadelphia
this January by Attorney
General Griffin Bell.

Marston, now running for the
Republican gubernatorial
nomination in Pennsylvania, a
state which he calls the most
politically corrupt in the Union,
spoke to a full house in Lee
Chapel last night.

Touching on a variety of
subjects—his firing by Presi-
dent Carter, his prosecution of
corrupt Philadelphia politicians
and his’ gubernatorial
aspirations—Marston’s speech
managed to keep the mainly
Republican audience entertain-
ed.

Marston said his now con-
troversial firing was prompted
by a phone call from Penn-
sylvania state representative
Daniel Eilberg to Griffin Bell in
which Eilberg urged the prompt
removal of Marston, and, ac-
cording to Marston, didn’t even
have anyone in mind to replace
him.

“Tf it boils down to a question
of whether any one is above the
law, and to a question of right
and wrong,’ said Marston,
“Anytime a congressman can
call the President and get an ef-
fective federal prosecutor out of
office then something’s wrong.”’

Two W&L Department Heads
Leave Posts to Coulling, Nye

Drs. Sidney M. B. Coulling
and Thomas G. Nye have been
appointed heads of Washington
and Lee University’s English
and biology departments,
respectively, effective July 1.
They succeed Drs. Severn
Duvall and James H. Starling.

The appointments were an-
nounced by W&L President
Robert E. R. Huntley following
Saturday’s meeting of the
university Board of Trustees.

Both Duvall and Starling will
return to full-time classroom
teaching.

Coulling, a 1948 B.A. graduate
of Washington and Lee, receiv-
ed his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees
from the University of North
Carolina. Before joining the
W&L faculty in 1956, he taught
at Florida State University and
at the University of Maryland.

An authority in Victorian
literature, Coulling is the
author of ‘‘Matthew Arnold and
his Critics,” published in 1974
by Ohio University Press, and
described in a London Times
Literary Supplement review as
‘a detailed, sustained and. il-
luminating picture.”’

Nye has taught at Washington
and Lee since 1966. He earned
his undergraduate degree in
biology and social sciences at
Fairmont (W. Va.) State Col-

lege and his advanced degrees
at the University of Kentucky.

His fields of teaching and
research specialty are ecology
and general botany. The author
of a number of scholarly arti-
cle,, Nye’s most recent publica-
tion is a teaching guide, ‘The
Trees of W&L,”’ published this
year by the university.

Duvall is Henry S. Fox Jr.
Professor of English, one of six
endowed professorships at the
university. He expressed a
strong desire to relinquish his
departmental administrative
duties after 16 years, Huntley
said. Duvall joined the W&L
faculty as full professor and
department head in 1962 after
teaching English at Dartmouth
for nine years.

He received his A.B. degree

       
   
   
     

 

_ The University Snack

from the University of Virginia
and his master’s and Ph.D.
degrees from Princeton. He is
an authority on the subject of
the Southern romance.

Starling is 65, the mandatory
retirement age for department
heads. He has been a member
of the biology faculty at
Washington and Lee since 1942.
He was acting department head
for a time following the death in
1974 of Dr. Henry S. Roberts,
and became permanent depart-
ment head in 1976.

He earned his bachelor’s and
master’s degrees from the
University of Alabama and his
Ph.D. in zoology and ecology
from Duke. His fields of
teaching are general zoology,
anatomy, and the study of
parasites.

showed that Eilberg was under
investigation at the time of the
firing. It’s. still uncertain
whether Carter knew about the
Eilberg investigation although
according to Marston, both
Carter and Griffin Bell ignored
a petition signed by 40,000 Penn-
sylvania voters saying that
Marston should not befired and
that he was doing a good job.

Marston said Bell told him the
firing was purely a matter
political patronage, and tried to
elicit from Bell a reason for his
dismiss. Bell admitted Marston
had done a good job and had not
used his office for political
gains but that it was simply
tradition to replace Marston,
Republican, with a Democrat.

This went against President
Carter’s promise to de-
politicize the Justice Depart-
ment, said Marston. ‘‘There’s
no room for politics in the
Justice Department,’’ said
Marston,’’ and when you can
pull strings in Washington to try
and do so then it has ominous
implications for any federal law
enforcement agency.”

Marston, now earning$60,000
a year as counsel for a big
Philadelphia law firm, said he
feels he is getting paid what he
deserves and did not use his
publicity to land him a good job.
‘‘ T see nothing unethical about
going back to work for a law
firm I’ve been working for a
long time,” he said in answer to
a question as to how he had got-
ten such a good paying job with
so few obligations. ‘In a big law
firm it’s not unusual at all,”’ he
said.

Marston, who as U.S, at-
torney got two of Penn-
sylvania’s most prominent
politician convicted on charges
of influence peddling and mail
fraud, said he used two power-
ful tools in getting evidence for
his investigations into political
corruption. Consensual
monitoring and the granting of
immunity to witnesses so they
would be forced to testify and
not hide behind the Fifth
Amendment which guards
against — self-incrimination,
were his most favorite and ef-
feti effective weapons.

‘As federal prosecutors we
were able to investigate the
white-collar crime better than
the local attorneys,’’ said
Marston. Marston added that
white-collar crime in America
such as influence peddling has

200 times more economic im-
pact than all the bank robberies
put together. :

Marston said that most of the
cases involving influence peddl-
ing are related to people trying
to buy influence with state
politic politicians so their
children can get into profes-
sional schools. ‘‘Other times
you get some disgruntled tax-
payer who calls up and says he
had to pay some politician
$10,000 to do a job he should or-
dinarily be doing for free,” said
Marston.

By consensual monitoring
Marston said he can get record-
ed evidence of an actual tran-
saction between a ‘‘bag man”
and some political official that
can be used in court.’’ There’s
no invasion of privacy here
because of the consent of one of
the individuals involved, and
this gives us good concrete
evidence that some state of-
ficial can’t refute in court,”
said Marston. Marston said
otherwise the suspected but
normally respected public of-
ficial can get up in court and
say he’s the victim of character
assasination at the hands of
some “‘bag man’’ who may have
a long list of convictions on his
record.

“If that was the case then the
jury would surely take the word
of a “respected official’ over
that of some criminal,” said
Marston.

Marston said it was very easy
to find corruption in Penn-
sylvania, ‘‘because there was so
much raw material to work
with.”” Marston credited much
of his success to the work of Neil
Walsh, whom Marston praised
as being the best FBI man in the
country. Walsh’s son Chris, a
W&L sophomore, introduced
Marston to the audience.

In response to a recent col-
umn by Jack Anderson which
said that many of Marston’s
former employess felt Marston
had used his office as a spr-
ingboard to higher political
plateaus, Marston said he
figured there would be a lot of
unhappy people once he got
through with his shake-up of
was earlier a “happy but
mediocre office.’’

_ “There was little or no com-
petition in the office,” said
Marston, and it may have made
some people mad when I got rid
of 23 of the 40 attorneys in the of-

‘Looking for Mr. Goodbar”’
The Land of Oz

 

by Seth Oserin

In the 1960’s, the American
public was snowed with the
total antithesis of Hollywood’s
fantasy-feeding function. The
film capital concentrated on
what life “‘is’’ and not what life
‘‘should be,’’ as it did during the
previous 40 years. A new breed
of writer emerged in the
guiltridden society of the 1960’s,
one that concentrated on reflec-
ting America’s. often
hypocritical values.

The average. filmgoer
couldn’t hide from these pro-
ductions. Ranging from
‘Clockwork Orange’ and
‘Catch 22”’ to Stanley Kubrick’s
“2001: A Space Odyssey,”
school was brought to the movie
theatre in a rather unconven-
tional manner. As a result, peo-
ple were finding it difficult to
relax in the theatre (to think is
not entertaining) and thus at-
tendance started to drop.

In essence, ‘Looking for Mr.
Goodbar”’ is the culmination of
Hollywood’s 15 years of
developing a credible presenta-
tion of life (or at any rate, its
more unpleasant and seamy

Dobja Dance
Company

to perform

It is always a bit refreshing to
have variety in the theatre
season of Lexington. Indeed,
the University Theatre has gone
a long way toward meeting this
goal during the present year;
we have seen Restoration and
modern comedies, classical and
American tragedies, and even
some minor shows from the
‘angry theatre’ series.

Playing next Tuesday at 8:00
PM and Wednesday at 1:00 PM
is the Dobja Dance Company,
another welcomed group for
variety on the stage.

The company has been form-
ed to experiment with new
types of ballet and mime, in an
attempt to combine the two im-
pressionistically. Their
brochure states that they are
abstract in form, but they are
concrete in expression. Even
though this sounds extremely
ambiguous, they have played to
large crowds and amassed a
number of good reviews. In the
Same school as the Warsaw
Mime Company, which played
here earlier this year, it will be
interesting to see where they
have divided in style and exper-
tise.

This type of production - as
educational as it is different -
should not be missed at the
theatre next week. After all, a
group of this magnitude doesn’t
come around too often.

  
 

   

 

sides). Director Richard
Brooks takes a script that has
everything but the film to put it
on, and presents an adequate
reflection of the present genera-
tion’s frustrations and desires.
Although one cannot relate all
the trials that Theresa (Diane
Keaton) encounters, the basic
sociological problems and
disappointments are easily
associated to true life.

Director Brooks should be
considered another casualty of
Hollywood politics, as he was
passed over for a well-deserved
Oscar nomination. He handles a
complex screenplay with an in-
credible insight into the script
and its characters. Theresa’s
fantasies are intermingled with
reality, with such sharpness
and perfection that the viewer
becomes’ extraordinarily
caught up into her character -- a
feat that is all too rarely ac-

complished in present-day
Hollywood.

receive an Oscar (the film got 2
nominations) for Best
Cinematography.

Tuesday Weld received a
nomination for Best Supporting
Actress as Theresa’s sister--
perhaps the least deserved of
all the possible nominations the
film could have been given.

However, the woman of the
hour is Diane Keaton, who
deserves , in addition to her role
in “Annie Hall,”’ a nomination
for her presentation of the
frustrated, reckless college
graduate trying to cope with the
pressures of the accelerated
social malaise that is typical of
New York City.

Those who considered ‘‘Satur-
day Night Fever’ a true slice of
New York life are only swallow-
ing sacharrin.

And those who find it difficult
to relate to the life style
presented by this film are mere-
ly lost in the depths of sheltered
naivete.

THE

Tennis Team No. l

RING-TUM PHI

in Division Ill

by Mike Farrand

The nation’s number one ten-
nis team in Division III has
played three matches in the
past week and pulled its overall
record from 3-2 to 4-4. The
record, however, shows
strength in the opposing teams
and not weakness in
Washington and Lee’s.

First came the match with
the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill last
Thursday. W&L admittedly,
did not have much chance
against the tennis excellence of
this Division I school. Ben
Johns went down to U.N.C.’s
Earl Hassler 6-1, 6-3; Stewart
Jackson was defeated by Junie
Chatman 6-1, 6-1; Cody Davis
was lashed 6-1, 6-1 by Cliff
Skakle; David Constine, mean-
while, was subdued by Gary
Taxman 6-2, 6-2. Because of
Robert Schuler’s absence, Doug
Gaker played number five and
fell to Jon Kraut 6-1, 6-2. Pat
Norris filled in the last spot on
the ladder and strongly pressed
Tal Henry in the first set but
went on to lose 7-5, 6-0. The
scores are rather unimpressive
but one must realize that Coach
Bussard dubbed the Tar Heels
as ‘‘definitely the toughest team
we've ever played.”

On home courts the following
day the Generals faired much
better, defeating Pittsburgh 8-1.
Pittsburgh stole only one vic-
tory point from W&L as Ben
Johns was sent to the bench
with a 6-3, 7-5 loss to Tom
Leibenguth. Stewart Jackson
downed Bill Pilardi but only
after winning a tiebreaker in
the second set — 6-1, 7-6 (5-2).
Cody Davis whipped Kevin
Quay 6-4, 6-2; Constine
steamrolled George Hoffman
6-0, 6-1, while Schuler did a
similiar job on his opponent
(Joe Mayers) on the adjoining
court; Gaker also entered the
victory circle with a 6-4, 6-3 win
over Doug White. In doubles the

results were much the same as
Johns (avvenging his singles
loss) teamed up with Jackson to
defeat Tom Leibenguth and
Pilardi 6-4, 6-4. Pat Norris and
Doug Gaker were in dire shape
(down 3-6, 2-3) before they won
by default as one of their op-
ponents collapsed with a hurt
ankle. Kell Ryan and David
Constine completed W&L’s
dominance over Pittsburgh
with a 6-0, 6-1 victory over
Mayers and Kepner.

Michigan State drove away
from Lexington Monday even-
ing with a 7-2 win over the
Generals. Tighe Keating
defeated Ben Johns 6-4, 6-3;
Kevin McNulty won over
Stewart Jackson 6-4, 6-3; Cody
Davis put up an commendable
fight against Steve Klemm
before losing 6-4, 3-6, 6-3; Matt
Sandler felled David Constine
6-3, 6-1; and Doug Gaker was
downed by Frank Willard 6-2,
6-0. The bright star for the
Generals on Monday was the
fifth man, Robert Schuler, who
annihilated his opponent, Steve
Heitzner, 6-3, 6-3. He later join-
ed with Doug Gaker to outlast,
with superhuman effort, the
Heitzner-Willard doubles team
in an extremely tense match
which was finally decided by
the score of 5-7, 7-6 (5-4), 7-6
(5-1). (Had Gaker and Schuler
lost the ninth point in the
second-set tiebreaker they
would have left the court in
defeat—needless to say they
won the point and the match.)
Other doubles scores were
Keating-McNulty over W&L’s
Johns-Jackson 3-6, 3-6 6-3, and
Klemm-Sandler over W&L’s
Davis-Norris 6-3, 6-2.

‘Now is the time to be self-
critical,’ states Coach Bussard,
‘I’m not sure that we're accru-
ing the expected benefits from
our tough schedule. Let's face
it, when we play the likes of
U.N.C. we are the under-dogs.

Golfers Beat
Lynchburg

by Charles Adler
Behind the one-under-par per-
formance of Dave Leunig, the
Washington and Lee golf team
won an important ODAC con-
test over Lynchburg on Tues-

day by a score of 389-400.
Leunig, who turned in a 70 tor
the day, was followed by team-
mate Jerry Maatman, who shot
a 76. Bo Moorehead, Andy. Fit-

zgerald and Terry Shadrick
also had zood-rounds tor W&L.
The golf team has now compiled
an undefeated record of 3-0.

The next match tor the
golferswill bu during Spring
break against Virginia Com-
monwealth University. W&L
will compete in the William and
Mary Classic at King’s Mill
following the match with VCU.

Team analyzed:

Lacrosse team beats UNC
now ranked 11th in country

W&L’s lacrosse team scored
their biggest win of the season
so far upending the sixth ranked
Tar Heels of North Carolina 6-4
last Saturday. The victory
catipulted the Generals from
their fifteenth ranking to their
current ranking of eleventh in
the nation.

Although the game was
played on a tain-soaked Wilson
Field, the quality of lacrosse
was still good. Neither team is
an offensive powerhouse. UNC
had previously lost a 9-8 deci-
sion to UVA. The Generals
reversed that score against
Towson.

Junior honorable mention All-
American attackman Jeff Fritz
had five of W&L’s six goals. He
scored two goals and tallied
three assists. Other scorers in-
cluded Jay Sindler, Jay Foster,

Track Team 3-1 after

John Black, and John Kemp.
Kemp and Black also recorded
assists for the Generals.

Charlie Brown had 11 saves
allowing only four goals. Coach
Emmer said prior to the game
that W&L had to take ad-
vantage of Carolina penalties to
win the game, and that they did
scorin scoring on four of nine
extra man situations. Carolina
was 0 of 2 on EM sitations keep-
ing W&L’s streak of not allow-
ing a man down goal all season
in tact.

Analysis

Perhaps the real reason for
the Generals success lies more
in North Carolina’s inability to
translate the quality and ex-

perience they have on their
team into a winning unit. With
eight out of ten starters on their
team seniors, it's unusual: for

such a team to display the
disourganization that North
Carolina did last Saturday.
Although they only received one
unsportsmanlike conduct penal-
ty, usually indicative of a
breakdown in communication
and leadership on the field. The
Tar Heels were lacking in this
department throughout the
game. This has the effect of
making it difficult for a team to
stage a rally to come from
behind.

A possible reason for this
breakdown on the field is the
lack of leadership
demonstrated from the coach
on the sidelines. If Coach Doty

Lynchburg loss
puts Generals at 0-5

by Warren Crowdus
After being pummeled by the
lopsided margin of 21-2 last
Thursday in Lynchburg by the
Lynchburg Hornets. the
Generals’ baseball squad
returned to Smith Field yester-
day and were beaten again by
the same team, 15-1. The talent
laden Hornets were led by the
five-hit pitching of Ken Shiflett,
and the awesome hitting of
‘Duke’ Snider. The Generals
were simply overmatched in

every phase of the game.
Snider, the Lynchburg first
baseman, paced a 16 hit attack

with two home runs and a dou-
ble, driving in four runs. The en-
tire Hornet team murdered
W&L pitchers, hitting safely in
every inning except the sixth.

Meanwhile, the General of-
fense was kept under wraps for
most of the afternoon by a com-
bination of bad luck ‘several
line drives were hit right at
Hornet fielders), good pitching
and solid fielding, particularly
by the Lynchburg shortstop.
The single run that the Generals
tallied was unearned.

The only -bright spot in an
otherwise dismal afternoon for

W&L was the hitting of
freshman Dan Kingman. who
was two for four and was robb-
ed of a third hit in the ninth
when his line drive was snared
by the~ Lynchburg third
baseman. Also, Mike Busbey
doubled and drew two walks in
his three plate appearances.

The defeat dropped the
General record to 0-5. They are
idle until next weekend, when
they will host Bluefield. Bristol

prentice in the Washington and

Rugby team now 1-2

by Alan Pryor

The Washington and Lee
Rugby Club has started off the
Spring season with a 1-2 record.
Their first home match is
scheduled for Sunday, April 23.
against the Charleston, West
Virginia Club.

Early season losses for the
rugby club have come against
UNC at Greensboro and Lyn-
chburg College while the win
was over Hampden-Sydney.
The club hopes to play about six
more matches this spring with
two or three of those games be-
ing at home. Club president Bev
Mauck said that the club wants

to end the season with a “spot in

‘the Virginia) Commonwealth
Tournament.”

The Rugby Club wili remaina
club because of the tact that

there ‘is no intercollegiate
league. The existing setup does
not even require a team to show
up for a match Mauck explain-
ed. He went on to will vary trom

Mauck said he was encourag-
ed by the increased turnout of
players to each practice. Due to
the interest shown by the club
members, the Athletic Commit
tee has sanctioned the club tor

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Temperance, Gentlemen

It’s about time that some people on campus grow up and start ac-
ting responsibly. There is a segment of the student population that
believes intoxication and its effects are inconsequential.-To anyone
in a clear state of mind that should be obviously wrong. Whether
these inebriated few realize it or not, their actions are detremental
to the student body and the reputation of the University.

The effects range from the SAB being thrown of duPont
auditorium because it was trashed with beer cans, to an article in
the Washington Post after fancy dress depicting W&L as a collec-
tion of skid row sots. There's little doubt that this hurt recruiting.
The effects are prevalent in the world of university sports. W&L
lacrosse fans have the reputation of being hearty ardent supporters
of their team. Unfortunately they have also garnered the reputa-
tion for being an obnoxious bottle-throwing mob. For the latter
reason some of our long-time lacrosse opponents, notably the Naval
Academy, refuse to play us.

Perhaps the saddest commentary on this subject is the fact that a
state of intoxication can ignite an incident between two W&L
students, where one could have been permanently maimed, or
fatally injured. When drunkenness reaches these proportions it’s
time for everyone to be concerned.

W&L’s rites of spring are considered by some to be rights to
revelry. Before one descends on the local girls’ schools or Wilson
Field, consider the possible consequences of your inebriation and
its subsequent reflection on the University. Confine debauchery to
your private residences where it likely to be only self-destructive.

Today the Rubicon is likely to be crossed in the University Coun-
cil meeting. The Student Affairs Committee is seeking the power to
change the severity of any penalty which the Student Control Com-
mittee has decided to impose. The faculty and administration
members of SAC may not realize the adverse consequences that
this act can inspire.

It certainly questions the philosophy that students can capably
handle their own affairs. This step could be the precedent for more
onerous acts.

With the knowledge that SAC could ultimately judge a case that
SCC is investigating’ will Student Control compromise their in-
quiry, anticipating a judgement from SAC, that would render a
penalty the SCC feels either too severe or inadequate? Such an
alternative is the only check the SCC would have on the SAC.

SAC’s mentality is analagous to the overbearing parent who
never gives the child the taste of responsibility, yet still expects
him to act responsibly.

One wonders why SAC members believe that they are better
judges of what is right and wrong than students.

‘Alas, poor Lee, I knew him, Horatio”’

It is not often that a newspaper takes the step of praising a
member of its own fold. Such an action is often viewed as being self-
serving and hollow. Nothing could be further from the truth when
we applaud Lee Howard's contribution to the Ring-tum Phiand the
Washington and Lee community. Mr. Howard, a senior journalism
major, will be spending his Spring term in Massachusetts as an in-
tern on a newspaper. As this is the last Phi he will have a hand in
assembling, it is an opportune time to assess his contribution.

Lee has exhibited the highest journalistic standards in his work.
He has been thorough, impartial, and dedicated in his pursuit of the
news and his writings. On numerous occasions he has sacrificed his
schoolwork to take on another assignment that someone else has
dropped. No plaudits can really equal the sacrifices he has made
for the Phi,

Regrettably he is viewed by some as having been a member of an
editorial conspiracy ‘‘out to get’’ certain elements of the student
population. There is no greater folly than believing in this. Howard
never used his power in a vindictive manner. His reporting always
had the best interests of the student body in mind. :

This year’s Ring-tum Phi has benefited immensely from Lee’s
presence. The Phi could not have been the success it has been
without him.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry
Levon Helm flops elsewhere;

not “egg’’actly Tucker’s fault

Dear Editor:

When one notices egg on his
face in a public fashion, it is
somewhat comforting to be able
to look at a peer in comparable
situation and see egg on his face
too. The cancellation of the
Levon Helm concert was
discomforting to the SAB and a
disappointment to the W&L stu-
dent body. But when a school
the size of
VirginiaCommonwealth (enroll
ment--about 18,000) is put in a
similar position of cancelling
Levon Helm just one week after
W&L’s cancellation, one con-
clusion can be made: Levon
Helm does not sell well in the
state of Virginia.

I talked with the head of
VCU’s equivalent of the SAB
and asked her about
background knowledge on their
promotion of Levon Helm. She
said that starting three weeks in
advance, VCU had daily broad-
casts on five Richmond stations
in the form of bulletin an-
nouncements. Four hundred
and fifty dollars worth of hand-
bills and posters were cir-
culated two weeks in advance.
The week of the concert, two
hundred dollars worth of paid
radio advertisements were
broadcast three times a day.
(This can be contrasted with the
SAB posting publicity and air-
ing radio transmissions just one
week before the concert). The
end result? VCU sold 60 tickets
in advance compared with our
sales of 72. A poor showing in-
deed for a $6,500 act. Levon
Helm sounds fine on paper and
on records, but the bottom line
on concerts is not sound, but
sales and Levon does not pass
the test on that subject.

This can also attest to the fact
that this has been an unusually
taxing year in entertainment,
as our increasing number of
visitors to SAB meetings can
verify. Levon Helm type acts
are more available than the
Charlie Daniels, the Marshall

Tuckers and the Outlaws. We
have to accept what the enter-
tainment market offers to a
school this size without an
auditorium of any proportion. I
am not trying to put a damper
on enthusiasm for spring con-
cert, but if you are dreaming
about Linda Ronstadt or a
Bruce Springsteen, keep on
dreaming. If you would like to
be informed to what is happen-
ing to SAB, come to our Sunday
night meetings at 7:00 in room
208 in the University Center.
But remember one thing: Lack
of input from you as a student
means that you forfeit your
right to complain when a deci-
sion is made.

The SAB can complain about
the amount of egg that has ac-
cumulated on its face this year ;
some of it deserved, some of it
not. Students can blame SAB
for scheduling, and subsequent-
ly having to cancel Levon Helm
two weeks ago’ The SAB can
blame the students for not sup-
porting what is obviously an ex-
tremely talented group, albeit a
group that does not sell well.
Egg can be thrown in both the
direction of students and the

SAB until a mass of congealed
mess cuts off communication
and effectively disconnects in-
put from each other.

That would not ‘‘egg’ actly be
a desireable solution, but it
could happen. What is a solu-
tion? More involvement by
Students in student activities.
The unusually large voter tur-
nout this spring is a good sign of
revitalized student interest in
campus politics. An even
greater sign would be for
students to do something more
than just vote for officers but to
actually participate in subcom-
mittees-of the student body as
voting and working members.
As a member of this year’s SAB
and next year’s EC, I would
urge all students to consider ap-
plying for some subcommittee
of the EC this spring term. Look
for the signs that will go up and
apply then. But there is always
one drawback to this sort of
thing, if you are a part of a
decision-making committee
and fail to register your input,
you lose your ability to com-
plain.
Sincerely,
Bill Tucker

Seven frats join voting block

(continued from page 1)

Thursday, it was decided by the
Delt membership that Martin
should resign from the IFC
Judicial Board, and an effort
should be made to have the en-
tire election nullified because
Martin cast a Delt vote in the
election. The IFC voting by-
laws allow for only IFC
representatives to vote in the
election.

Martin resigned at a specially
called Interfraternity Council
meeting Tuesday night. ‘‘I join-
ed the Red Square voting block
without asking the members of
my fraternity,’’ he explained.

“The IFC should not be
predecided,’’ said
Thistlethwaite, ‘‘because it is
supposed to be a representative
body.’’ He called the ‘‘block’’ a
“secretive organization.”

His criticism of the “block’’
was countered by an IFC
representative, John Bruch,
who said “‘five or six frater-
nities were just pooling their
sentiments; that’s just
politics.”

Thistlethwaite also argued
that Martin’s vote in the IFC
election ‘may have had a ge-
nuine effect on the outcome of
the election.’’ He said Martin
had voted in the Senior Justice
election in which Madison
Spencer (Sigma Nu) defeated

Fraiser Humphreys (Sigma
Chi) 8-6. A Delt vote for Hum-
phreys would have tied the elec-
tion.

Technically, according to the
IFC by-laws, Martin could not
have cast a vote in the election
with Thistlethwaite there to
cast the Delt votes.

IFC President Jim Davis call-
ed the election an “unfortunate
situation.’’ He added, however,
‘*T don’t think (Martin’s vote) is
a problem to be handled by this
committee.”’

Davis further argued against
a recall of all the elected posi-
tions by noting that ‘‘these peo-
ple are in office and need to
start working together.”

“It was a violation of the by-
laws’’ for Martin to vote in the
elections, Davis conceded. But
he characterized the attempt to
recall the entire election ‘‘a
shaky issue.”

A motion introduced by the
IFC representative from Sigma
Chi to recall the entire election
was watered down to a recall of
Madison Spencer’s Senior
Justice position.

In a showdown vote on the
issue, Spencer was removed
from office by a vote of 9-5-1.

retain Spencer. Kappa Alpha,
which joined the ‘‘Red Square
Machine” after the election for
IFC president and vice- presi-
dent, abstained on the vote.

New elections for the two va-
cant offices will be held after
Spring break. Spencer may
seek reelection.

Unlike the elections last
week, nominations will be taken
the first week of the spring
term, with the elections the
following week to give fraterni-
ty members a bigger voice in
the election. Last week,
nominations and elections were
on the same night.

There was considerable
resentment among the
memberships of some non-
block fraternities about the for-
mation of a political machine to
assure the election of certain
candidates.

IFC President Jim Davis (Phi
Kappa Sigma) said “‘the pur-
pose of the block was not bad.”’
He said the fraternities in the
block had nominated ‘‘their
best men.”

Davis added, however, ‘I
think Phi Kap was made an ex-
ample of this year. We have got-
ten unfair punishment all
year.” As a result, the Phi Kaps
made a determined effort to
gain more influence in various
student organizations, he ex-
plained.

Davis also said that he had at-
tended the second block
meeting to organize last week’s
“machine” vote, although he
had already been elected IFC
President. ‘‘I sat there and wat-
ched the whole thing,’”’ Davis
said, ‘‘and did not participate.”’

There is talk of a temporary
‘“counter-block”’ being formed
by the non-block fraternities for
the election after spring break.
Its purpose is apparently to en-
sure that non-block houses have

-a Say in IFC policy next year.

and that there are no im-
proprieties in the levying of
fines against non-block houses.

To allay fears of unfair
“block” rulings through their
control of the IFC, Davis said,
“we aren’t going to start slan-
ting fines away from the
block.”

Davis also expressed the fear
that the ‘“‘Red Square Machine”’
issue would “‘split the IFC down
the middle’’ rendering the com-
mittee ineffective in dealing
with fraternity problems.

by Randy Smith

Jim Davis, newly elected IFC
president, has admitted that
members of his fraternity, Phi
Kappa Sigma, felt they had
received ‘‘unfair punishment”’
this year from many sides.

The SAEs also felt they had
come under extraordinary
criticism this year.

It was only natural, then, for
the two to come to an
understanding that they should
unite in a concerted effort to
capture the seats of control in
the various branches of student
government for next year.

How the “Machine” worked

 

News Analysis

 

That their planning has been
successful is evident in the
results of this week’s class elec-
tions and last week’s IFC elec-
tions.

Originally, the ““Red Square
Machine” was made up of Phi
Kappa Sigma, Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon, Phi Delta Theta, and Beta
Theta Pi.

Jim Davis (Phi Kap) and
Rich Huck (Beta) were the
voting block’s candidates in the
fraternity membership-wide
elections for IFC president and
vice-president.

Much to their credit, those
four fraternities got out the vote
in the election and got their can-
didates into office.

But the IFC elections for
secretary, treasurer, rush and
social chairmen, and three
Judicial Board justices posed a
different problem: those posi-
tions were elected only by the
fraternity representatives to

 

 

the IFC--each house casting two
votes.

In order for SAE Fred Moore
and Phi Delt Syd Farrar to win
Junior Justice and secretary,
the block had to be expanded.

Three fraternities were added
to the block: Kappa Alpha,
Delta Tau Delta, and Sigma Nu.

  

    

In return for a place on the
block ticket, each fraternity
new to the block pledged their
votes for the other “machine”
candidates. The block then had
the clout to control what proved
to be a confusing election.

As it turned out, the block won
six of seven available positions-
-three candidates were unop-
posed. The unity of the block
collapsed on the vote for rush
chairman when the Delts and
the SNus bolted the group and
voted for other candidates
(which explains how Pi Phi
Chris Volk was elected IFC
Rush Chairman).

Bill Thistlethwaite’ the Delt
IFC representative instumental
in exposing the ‘‘machine’s”’ ex-
istence, does not believe the for-
mation of a voting block is
unethical. ‘“‘You have to admire
their ability to mobilize such a
large voting force,” he said.

What injured the ‘‘Red
Square Machine”’ was that two
fraternities pledged their sup-
port without the full member-
ship being aware of the situa-
tion. Hence, Thistlethwaite’s
argument that the election was
“not representative’ of true
fraternity sentiments.

The voting block controversy

also illuminated the ‘‘am-
biguous’’ voting procedures
prescribed in the IFC by-laws.
Davis has promised to revise
those ‘‘ambiguities”’ this spring
and hopefully eliminate some of
the gross problems which
became apparent in this affair.
‘ Indications are that a
“‘counter-block”’ will be formed
to off-set the influence of what
remains of the “Red Square
Machine.”

This makes sense because
eventhough Davis has assured
that ‘“‘we aren’t going to start
slanting fines away from the
block,” the non-block frater-
nities want to guarantee
fairness by being represented in

SAB Report to EC:

routine report.like those given
by other committees,’’ EC vice
president George Griffin said
before Ring-tum Phi business
manager Peter Goss gave his
financial report.

Goss said the student
newspaper would be ‘very
close to a break-even point this
year.”

Although he placed the
balance of the Ring-tumPhi’s
budget at approximately $2,300,
he said “advertising revenue
drops off at this time of year.”
Non-printing costs added to his
calculated future expenses for
the newspaper.

Jeff Bird, treasurer of the
Publications Board, reported
the balance of the board’s
budget to be $6,994. He said the
committee which oversees all
student-run publications had
spent only about $200 this year.

Underhill objected to an $8
bill from White Front Super-
market for snacks purchased
during last year’s three-hour
session to choose this year’s
editors and business managers.

In discussing the use of stu-
dent body funds to pay for
refreshments, Underhill said,
“We don’t do it; I don’t think
you should either.”’

Griffin added, ‘If a commit-
tee wants to have a party, they
can come to the EC meeting for

permission’ (because EC
meetings are open).
“F gent think it’s

unreasonable for the Publica-
tions Board to spend seven or
eight dollars on snacks over the
course of the year,’’ replied
Bird. He received formal per-
mission for the board to again
have refreshments this year.
The vote was unanimous.

The University Center Com-
mittee requested $600 to provide
entertainment in the Cockpit
during the spring term.

Because the EC has already
given that committee more
than $3,200 for entertainment in
the Cockpit this year, they were
asked to return in the spring
with a specific request. ‘We
want to give money to specific
things,” Griffin said.

Administration
“Removes” Papers

In a statement released late
Monday afternoon, administra-
tion officials admitted remov-
ing some of last week’s con-
troversialRing-tum Phis.

The carefully worded state-
ment made a distinction bet-
ween the administration’s ac-
tion and actual confiscation of
the student newspaper.

Only the “‘handfull’’ of papers
which were still in the Student
Center Friday afternoon were
‘removed to the Office of the
Director of the Student Center,”
the administration statement
said.

Between ‘‘50 and 75”’ copies of
the Rank-tam Poon were
gathered up by Student Center
Director Michael Cappeto ac-
ting on a telephone call from
Robert S. Keefe, director of the
University News Office.

Keefe said that he ordered the

newspapers be removed
because parents of prospective
students visiting the school
were obtaining copies. Keefe
verified his action with Lewis
John, Dean of Students, after he
had ordered Cappeto to remove
the lampoon issues.

“The administration will

reserve the same right to act
again as they did last week,”’
Keefe said in an interview Tues-
day.

“This does not reflect a new
set of values that the ad-
ministration has suddenly
adopted,”’ he said, noting that
the administration would not
take similar action in the future
“casually.”

Keefe cited ‘two formal
associations’”’ which the ad-
ministration views as giving
them the right to. remove the

Harry Chapin to
perform May 11

by M. Gray Coleman

Harry Chapin - famous
singer, songwriter, and
nominee for both the Oscar and
the Grammy Awards - has been
signed by the Student Activities
Board to perform at
Washington and Lee on Thurs-
day, May 11. The concert, which
guarantees two hours or more
of solid Chapin entertainment,
will take place in Doremus
Gymnasium at 8pm. Tickets
are scheduled to go on sale by
Monday, May 8, outside Mike
Cappetto’s office in the Student
Center. Ticket price for the ad-
vance sale will be $4; tickets at
the door will be $5.

Applauded by newspapers
and critics across the country
as ‘‘one of the most creative
songwriters of this decade or
any decade,” Chapin’s hits

range from “‘Circle”’ to ‘‘Cat’s
In The Cradle.’’ Especially
renowned as a storyteller in
song, Chapin is noted for his
portrayals in song of real peo-

_ ple, with problems that his au-

dience can respond to - as one
newspaper said, “Chapin is a
magician who builds pictures of
happiness or tragedy with his
music. It’s nice to know there is
still a singer-songwriter who
hasn’t lost touch with the mor-
tals on the streets. One who
hasn’t had all his rough edges
smoothed and can still write
about more than juvenile hear-
tache.”’

The Chapin concert is indeed
a rare effort on the part of the
SAB to bring to campus a “big
name” performer. This affair is
inten intended to take the place

Last week’s edition of the
Ring-tum Phi caused a con-
troversy which reverberated
across the state. Much attention
was directed to the paper’s
‘“Jampoon”’ section, the Rank-
tam Poon.

The joke issue, the first in
several years, was labeled
“distasteful, disgusting and a
disgrace to the University”’ in a
statement released by ad-
ministration officials the day
after publication.

Of particular concern to
University officials were: an
editorial cartoon which
graphically depicted a common
fraternity party activity called
“gatoring”; a detailed article
on campus bathroom graffitti;
the two word editorial opinion of
the Rank-tam Poon; and a
mock sports story, ‘“‘Wrestlers
lose to Sin.”

University response to the
newspaper was to revoke the
third class postal permit for
that issue and to “remove”
50-75 copies of the Rank-tam
Poon from the Student Center
Friday afternoon.

J. Michael Gallagher, editor
of the Ring-tum Phi, responded
to the administration’s action
by saying, “They tell us it’s our
publication, but we_ print
something they don’t like and

 

: = ileal ii ies

they confiscate it. I’m surprised
they didn’t have the copies
burned on the collonade.”’

Gallagher said that the paper
is ‘‘supposed to be independent
of direct control by the faculty
or administration.”’

“The University took no ac-
tion to prevent the Ring-tum
Phi from reaching students. At
no time was it stated or sug-
gested that distribution not in-
volving University facilities
would be disallowed ,”’ said an
administration statement
released late Monday after-

noon.

RtP Road Race

by Jerry Harris

The Second Annual Ring-tum
Phi Road Race will be held in
Lexington this Sunday, April 30,
starting at 9:00 a.m. The gruel-
ing long-distance run is ex-
pected to draw a larger group of
entrants this year than the first
RtP Road Race which was
termed a_ success by _ its
originator Mike Gallagher.

Participants in the race must
arrive at the Courthouse on
Main Street in Lexington by
8:30 a.m. on Sunday morning to
register and pick up their con-
testant numbers. After some
brief instructions the runners
will proceed to negotiate a 15
mile course that will take them
through Lexington and
numerous country roads before
they end up running one lap
around Wilson Field. Jerry Dar-
rell will provide refreshments
at aid stations every three miles
of the course. The Lexington
Rescue Squad will also drive
along the route to treat any
possible emergencies.

The only requirement for run-
ning in the race is a three dollar
entry fee with all proceeds go-
ing to the Multiple Sclerosis
fund. Last year the event
garnered $100 for the local MS
chapter. Gallagher indicated
that it is every hope and inten-
tion of the RtP Road Race
workers to raise more money

this year. As a bonus to anyone
participating in the race, t-
shirts commemorating the
event will be given to the en-
trants.

Last year marked the first
time that such an event was
held in this area and at the time,
community leaders expressed
the hope that it would become a
mainstay in charity efforts. In-
deed, the race attracted a lot of
attention and has helped to
establish a more direct link bet-
ween the local community and
Washington and Lee. It is the
opinion of some that the RtP
Road Race will be here to stay
and grow in popularity if this
year’s field is a respectable one,
both in size and quality.

Even though the final number
of entrants will not be determin-
ed until Sunday morning, there
are some early indications that
this year’s race will be a highly
competitive one. Brian Adams,
a second place finisher, is runn-
ing again as are noted long-
distance runners Bob Bates and
Jack Coffey. There are also a
number of unknowns who are
recognized as distance runners.
Also expected to participate is
George Cunningham of the Lex-
ington Postal Service, who last
year wowed the spectators with
his ironman performance
despite his advanced age. Un-

Rank-tam Poon Stirs Controversy

kkewek *
Pub. Board

retains

Gallagher

 

Advertisers
Compensated

by Randy Smith

Student opinion proved to be
the decisive factor in Monday’s
Publications Board decision not
to remove J. Michael Gallagher
as editor of the Ring-tum Phi.

An estimated 150 students and
faculty attended the Pub. Board
meeting called to consider the
removal of Gallagher because
of his role in the publication of
last week’s Rank-tam Poon —
the first joke issue of the
Washington and Lee University
student newspaper in several
years.

Jeff Bird, last year’s business
manager of theCalyx and a cur
rent member of the Pub. Board,
introduced the motion to
dismiss Gallagher from the
editorship of the Ringtum Phi.
Parker Potter, the current
editor of Ariel and_ the
designated entertainment
editor of next year’s
newspaper, seconded the mo-
tion.

But after almost 45 minutes of
questions and comments from
the students attending the
meeting, Bird withdrew his mo-
tion saying, ‘‘After what has
been said here (by students sup-
porting Gallagher), I cannot in
good conscience keep my mo-
tion on the floor.”’

The Board subsequently
voted 5-1-2 that the dismissal
motion be withdrawn.

Bird had originally initiated
the Publications Board’s verbal
investigation of ‘Whether Mike
was responsible or irresponsi-
ble for the publication”’ of last
week’s joke issue.

Bird led the discussion by
saying that he was ‘‘disgusted”
with the content of the Rank-
tam Poon. He added that he was
‘‘embarrassed’’ by the
newspaper and said that the
issue indicated ‘negligence and
indifference’ on Gallagher's
part toward his responsibilities
as editor.

“My own opinion (of the
Rank-tam Poon can be summ-
ed up by your editoral.
Michael,”’ Bird said. The two-
word editorial read: ‘Screw
you.’

Defending his editorial in the
joke issue, Gallagher said,
‘That's what the students felt I
had been saying all year long.”

“I don't think the Rank-tam
Poon was irresponsible; it was

student funded newspaper from
circulation: ‘‘1, the University
collects a mandatory activity
fee from every student, partly
on behalf of theRing-tum Phi; 2,
the Ring-tum Phi is mailed
under a permit sponsored and
endorsed by the University.”

Keefe said the administration
had “removed the newspapers
from circulation permanently,”
but declined the words ‘‘con-
fiscate’’ or ‘‘seize’’.

The University statement us-
ed the term ‘‘disallow further
distribution’’ to describe its ac-
tion. ‘“‘There was no thought
given to rounding up copies that
had been distributed (as ‘“‘con-
fiscation’’ implies),’’ the state-
ment read.

900 copies still missing

The administration did not,
however, take responsibility for
the 600-1,200 copies of the
newspaper estimated to be
missing.

The estimates, which had
been released to the national
press, were determined by
Ring-tum Phi editor J. Michael
Gallagher who placed at least
part of the responsibility on

members of his own staff.

“IT was told that Gray Col-
eman (entertainment editor
and next year’s Ring-tum Phi
editor-in-chief) went
around gathering up Rank-tam
Poons from the Student Center
Friday,” Gallagher said. ‘‘And
that Coleman was
apologizing to people for the
paper, even though he had not
only known some of the contents
of the paper, but had con-
tributed to it,” he added.

“Goss is in charge of circula-
tion and distribution and we
know that at least 900 papers
were never delivered,’
Gallagher said. He listed four
distribution points as the basis
for his figures: 250 papers to the
Alumni House, 250 to the Ring-
tum Phi office, 300 to the
library, and 100 to the law
school.

Gallagher admitted that he

had not confronted Coleman}

before releasing his statements
to the press.

The Publications Board has
appointed a committee to in-
vestigate the disappearance of
the still missing newspapers.

 

 

Fire Wrecks
Student’s Room

A fire of unknown origin
blackened a student’s room on
the third floor of Davis dor-
mitory Wednesday afternoon.

Paul Harris, the occupant,
said that he was not in the room
at the time. Harris said he was
in the computer room at the
time of the fire.

‘*Most of my desk was burned
up,’’ he said of the damage, and
he also lost his stereo, rug,
clothes and books.

The fire ‘‘filled the hall with
smoke,” but the Lexington fire
department was on the scene in
time to spare extensive
damage.

Harris is sleeping with a
friend. The University is still in-
vestigating the cause of the
blaze.

ODK Elects New Officers

At a recent meeting _ of
Omicron Delta Kappa, the na-
tional leadership honorary
fraternity founded at W&L in
1914, elections were held for the
1978-79 officers. After a secret
ballot, Matt Calvert and George
Ballantyne were elected presi-
dent and vice-president, respec-
tively. Calvert, a second-year
law student at W&L, has been
active in the Alpha Circle of
ODK since his tapping as an
undergraduate here - an almost
unprecedented record of long
service. Ballantyne, a rising
senior, was one of five members
in his class to be chosen for
membership in ODK this
January.

This year’s student members
of ODK, led by outgoing presi-
dent John Bruch, have taken
great steps toward making the
organization more than a one-
time honor. Special emphasis in
the meetings has gone toward
discussion of the relations bet-
ween the law~ and
undergraduate schools. Many
actions, from better news
dissemination to the suggestion
of a “Big Three Candidates’
Night”’ at Lewis Hall as well as
at Lee Chapel, have already
been taken.

Even so, ODK intends to

(continued from page 1)
of ‘‘Spring’s Weekend,” in
which Pavillion parties, frater-
nity combos, and the junior
class grain party all merged for
one last blow-out before the
women’s colleges let out for the
summer.

The junior class has schedul-
ed its grain party for this Satur-
day afternoon after the N.C.
State lacrosse game. According
to both Bill Tucker (SAB Chair-
man) and Pete Williams (junior
class president) there had been
an attempt to converge the con-
cert and the class party on the
same weekend. Unfortunately,
problems involving the booking
of the concert resulted in a stall
in the SAB; in the intervening
time, the junior class officers

set the date for their party, and
found it impossible to roll back
the date, after learning of
Chapin’s arrival on May 11.

As a result, the  social-
entertainment scene for the spr-
ing continues in its fragmented
state. The grain party on April
29 will no doubt benefit from
lacrosse crowds that afternoon.
But the Chapin concert still
hangs precariously at the start
of a very empty weekend. The
SAB, still reeling from the du-
Pont Hall ban on movies in their
auditorium, continues to make
the best of the situation in the
cramped quarters of Room 114
in the Student Center. While
discussing this and other pro-
blems, the Board is still con-
sidering some sort of activity
for the May 12-14 period.

The undergraduates on the

night to decide what graduating
senior shall receive the Gilliam
Award, given to one who has

Nominations should be turned

The Gilliam Award was
created in 1963 in honor of Dean
Frank J. Gilliam, who retired in
1963, after many years as
Washington and Lee’s Dean of
Admissions and Dean of
Students. The award is given
solely on the basis of service,
rather than in consideration of
need.

There will be discussion next
week on the Spring E.C. party.

pression of involvement. Last
Monday night, $700 was obtain-
ed from the EC to hold any sort
of joint party between the
schools that ODK specified. At
the Tuesday night ODK
meeting, plans were finalized
for a party which will take place
on May 5, from 4 til 7 pm. While
the location of the affair is still
under consideration, most
members of the society have ex-
pressed a preference for the
field outside Lewis Hall, to get
optimum attendance from the
graduate students.

In addition, the plans for the
party include some sort of
entertainment. A _ suggestion
was made that a local bluegrass
band be contracted, or that
taped music provided by
undergrads be obtained. But in
any event, the center of the par-
ty will be beer -and lots of it. Ap-
proximately $500 will be spent
to obtain some 15 kegs of beer,
with cups, ice; and so forth.

Harry Chapin

 

 

Singer and Storyteller

by M. Gray Coleman

“‘Chapin concert...Pure
delight. Chapin earns full
marks as a performer, song
writer, singer...The audience
wouldn’t let him leave. Stan-
ding ovation...Cheering.
Remember W.O.L.D. ‘‘Cats In
the Cradle,” ‘Circle’? All
popular songs that touched the
people’s consciousness. Chapin
creations. That seems to be
what Harry Chapin wants to do;
to make people see their world
and fellow man with compas-
sion and empathy. A modern
mixture of Pied Piper and Pete
Seeger.”’

So wrote just one reviewer
about an entertainer who has
taken the industry by storm ina
very short time - Harry Chapin.
Few people who devote their
lives to both entertainment and
to public service have been as
successful on both fronts. In the
last two years alone, Chapin has
raised close to a million dollars
for various charities through
hundreds of benefit concerts. As
an artist, he has earned a gold
album, a gold single, an Oscar
nomination, two Grammy
nominations, and a 1976 Rocky
award in recognition of his
public service activities.

Harry Chapin was_ born
December 7, 1942, in Greenwich
Village in New York City.
Harry and his three brothers all
gravitated towards music, in-
fluenced by their father who
was a drummer with the Tom-
my Dorsey and Woody Herman
bands.

Harry worked in various ends
of the entertainment business -
forming an act with his brothers
for a time, then working with
film and documentary. One of
these documentaries, Legen-
dary Champions, brought him
his Academy Award nomina-
tion in 1969. page 2- Chapin
feature

Just before he got into film-
making Harry applied for a taxi
driver’s license, and was
prepared to do that to make
ends meet. The song “Taxi,”’
from his first mature album,
Heads and Tales, became a
worldwide hit in 1972.

More hits soon followed from
the ‘‘storyteller.”’ In 1974 ‘‘Cat’s
In The Cradle,” from the album
Verities and Balderdash,
became a hit, propelling both
the single and the album to gold
status.

Chapin’s rigorous performing
schedule keeps him busy

Ariel Returns With
2nd Issue In May

According to Parker Potter,
Editor of this year’s Ariel, the
second issue of the magazine
has already been sent to the
printer, and will be available
for distribution sometime in
mid-May.

This new Ariel will be 12
pages larger than the last in-
stallment. The emphasis here is
on variety with abunndance —
for example, there are to be
four short stories, and the styles
of the various poems and stories
will embrace everything from

student body has indeed picked
up; well over a_ dozen
manuscripts were received
quite recently.

Unfortunately for his legions
of fans, there will be no work
present from the pen of the im-
famous Angus I, N. Herbert,
who penned the ‘‘Red Square
Drinking Song’ of recent
memory. One can only wonder
what would have happened, had
Mr. Herbert turned his atten-
tion to such localities as
Washington Hall or Doremus
Gymnasium.

Chris Volk will again be sup-
plying the photography for this
issue. And, continuing a good
feature of the last Ariel, Potter
will be integrating the photos
with his verbal works according
to theme.

When asked about this most
recent production, Potter com-
mented: ‘In comparing my two

issues, while the last Ariel could

be called ‘classical’ — well-
defined, orthodox literature
types of generally short

length— the attempt with this
one was to be more ina ‘roman-
tic’ vein. The overall structure
of the periodical is designed to
include as many _ different
(often experimental) stories
and poems as possible. The
pages will be literally bursting
with material, rather than the
finely chiseled, one poem-one
page format of last January.”

mended for his success with a

Golfers capture

ODAC title

by Jim Ingham

Behind the playing of Jerry
Maatman and Dave Leunig, the
Washington and Lee golf team
captured the ODAC crown on
Monday. The Generals, under
ODAC Coach of the Year Buck
Leslie, still have five matches
to play, beginning with a con-
test on Friday against Roanoke
College at Roanoke.

The 36 hole ODAC tourna-
ment, played at the Staunton
Country Club, left the Generals
with a 628 total for their top four
players. Maatman had a two
round total of 151 to take first
place honors while Leunig shot
a 157 to come in third overall.
Bo Moorhead was in a four way
tie for sixth place at 160. Along
with Leslie receiving Coach of
the Year honors was Maatman,
who earned ODAC Player of the
Year.

On Monday and Tuesday last
week, in the William and Mary
Classic, the Generals placed
seventh in a field of 15. Leslie
said that this performance
“wasn’t too bad,’’ considering
exam week and spring break
meant an almost two week

layoff. Following the W&M
Classic, the team played a
match against Longwood Col-
lege, and won handily behind
the play of Maatman, who shot
a 68.

Leslie feels that the team is
“playing well right now.’’ He
stated that the long winter hurt
the team, and that only now is it
really starting to come around.
Leslie said that “‘if we continue
to play this well we will pro-
bably go to the Nationals.’’ He
went on to say that they would
not have a definite answer on
the post season play question
until the first or second week in
May.

The ODAC tournament is held
in the middle of the Generals’
schedule because a number of
the ODAC schools let out long
before W&L does. The away
match against Roanoke on Fri-
day is followed by a home
match with Bridgewater on
Monday. The Generals will then
have a match against Randolph
Macon and Bridgewater at
Randolph-Macon on Wednesday
before returning home on next

_ Friday for the regular season

finale against Roanoke.

Tennis team ODAC

by Mike Farrand

Washington and Lee’s varsity
tennis team became ODAC
champions over the weekend
with impressive wins over
seven other of Virginia’s Divi-
sion III schools. Playing on
home courts Friday and Satur-
day, the Generals stroked their
way to a score of 72 and the
ODAC crown. Emory and
Henry placed second with a dis-
tant 54 while the other colleges
fell in line as follows: Hampden
Sydney 48, Randolph-Macon 44,
Bridgwater 40, Lynchburg 29,
Eastern Mennonite 23, and
Roanoke 14.

In the finals of that event
W&L swept all nine flights with
singles victories by Ben Johns
over Vince Thomas of
Hampden-Sydney 6-2, 5-7, 6-1,
Stewart Jackson over Robert
Anderson of Emory and Henry
6-0, 6-1, Doug Gaker over Ben
Cart of H-S 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, David
Constine over John Milleson of
Bridgewater 6-0, 6-0, and Pat
Norris over Steve Young of
Bridgewater 6-2, 4-6, 6-1.

In Blacksburg, on April 18,
the Generals fell to Virginia

and Jackson winning 6-4, 7-6. On

Lacrosse team beats N.C. State

in sudden death overtime

In a sudden death overtime
game, the Washington and Lee
lacrosse team beat North
Carolina State 13-12 Wednesday
afternoon. Jay Foster scored
the deciding goal 57 seconds in-
to the overtime period as the
eighth ranked Generals downed
the eleventh ranked Wolfpack.
The General’s next game is at
2:00 PM tommorrow against
Washington College on Wilson
Field.

Behind at one time by the
score of 10-6, the lacrosse team
came back and tied it at 10 all.
They then traded goals to make
the score 12-12, setting the stage
for Foster’s game winning shot.

Ths statistics of the game
showed a very even contest.
Both teams were penalized
seven times for six minutes
each, and both w were three for
seven in extra man goals. W&L
picked up 60 ground balls to N.
C. States 59, while N. C State
won 18 of 29 faceoffs. Charlie
Brown had 14 saves, and
Wolfpack goalie Bob Flintoff
had 18.

Head Coach Jack Emmer

the score of 24-19.

UVa Stuns Generals

by Sandy Bishop

Over the last five years, the
clash with the University of
Virginia had become money in
the bank for W&L’s lacrosse
squad. But the Generals were
left with only memories of that
dominance following last Satur-
day’s affair.

Virginia, dominating every
facet of the game, controlled
the tempo of the contest and ex-

Court Situation Explained

by Jim Ingham

The six tennis courts under
the bridge going to Wilson Field
are being resurfaced and should
be ready for student use by the
end of next week, according to
Dick Miller, Assistant Director
of Athletics.

Miller explained that the sur-
face of these courts are not clay
but crushed stone, and that
every year more crushed stone

needs to be added to the surface
along with a binder material to
make the crushed stone stick.
He said that keeping the courts
in good condition takes ‘‘a lot of
work’”’ because they need to be
rolled and wetted everyday.
This work will continue even

after play has resumed on the
courts, Miller said. He also add-
ed that as soon as work is com-
pleted on the courts they will be

in the “best shape that- they
have been in for a long time.”’

 

The tennis courts by Wilson
Field are in use during D, E,
and F hours from Monday
through Thursday and from
1:30-3:00 five days a week. If a
match is being played, the
courts will be in use fromlap-
proximatel until approximately
5:00.

ploited weaknesses in the W&L
defense to whip the Generals
14-6 at the Lane High School
field before more than 6,000
fans.

W&L tallied first on Jay
Sindler’s low bouncer from the
restraining line at the 11:42
mark of the first quarter. The
Generals even held the lead
following the opening quarter,
2-1, but they were hardly in con-
trol of the situation. The
Generals, whose second goal
was tipped in by UVA
defenseman Kevin O’Shea,
were outshot 23-5 in that period,
and only a_ brilliant per-
formance by goalie Charlie
Brown prevented early
disaster. ‘‘Charlie kept us in the
game early,’’ said head coach
Jack Emmer.

Brown’s finest save of the
quarter occurred in the last
thirty seconds as he faced UVA
All-American Kris Snider one-
on-one. Snider, charging toward
the goal on a fast break, faked
high, then low, then shot high,
but Brown had it all the way.

The senior co-captain,
however, could not stop
Virginia alone, and the barrage

of second-quarter Cavalier .

shots produced four straight
goals and a 5-2 lead with 7:46
left in the half. Individual
dodges, an effective part of the
UVA game plan all afternoon,
produced three of those goals.
Virginia, unsuccessful in its
previous attempts to slow down
the play in games against
Hopkins and Maryland, was
now running and gunning.
Although Jeff Fritz narrowed
the gap to 5-3 three minutes
before halftime, the Generals
would never get closer to vic-
tory.

Things only got worse for
W&L in the second half. The
Generals were held scoreless

for the first 22 minutes of the
half while the Cavaliers
pumped in seven goals, mostly
on one-on-one dodges. Mark
Derbyshire’s goal with 7:45 left
made it 12-4, but no miracle
comeback was in the making.
Emmer even moved Brown to
midfield in an effort to get more
punch in his frustrated offense,
but it was to no avail.

The Cavaliers, in raising their
record to 5-3, outshot the
Generals, 61-29, and won 16
faceoffs to W&L’s seven. “They
were much more intense about
the situation,’ said Emmer. “‘It
was the most aggressive
Virginia team that we’ve seen.”’

UVA was not only aggressive
but also well prepared, due in
part to assistant coach Tom
Keigler’s knowledge of the
General players. “I think
Keigler knew our personnel
pretty well,” Emmer said.
Keigler, an All-American
defenseman here at W&L, is at-
tending graduate school as well
as assisting head coach Jim
Adams at Virginia.

The Generals can still deter-
mine their own fate concerning
the post-season tournament.
Now ranked eighth in the na-
tion, W&L faced a vastly im-
proved N.C. State team in
Raleigh Wednesday. The
Wolfpack, a 24-19 winner over
_UVA earlier in the season, is led
by Canadien Stan Cockerton.

On Saturday, the Generals
play host to Washington College
on Wilson Field at 2:00 p.m. The
following Wednesday has
Roanoke College invading
W&L. With the Roanoke team
comes their fans called the
‘‘Nasties,’’ who try to distract
the opponents defensemen and
goalie by yelling obscentities.
The ‘Nasties’ have caused
quite a stir in recent weeks, and —

Baseball team near
end of season

by Warren Crowdus

The Washington and Lee
baseball team came out with
only one win against four losses
last week, which included two
double-head contests.

The team split their
doubleheader against Eastern
Mennonite College by scores of
7-1 and 5-6. The Generals’ vic-
tory in the opener was due
largely to the seven hit pitching
performance of sophomore Vic
Shepard. The Generals led in
the early stages of the nightcap
but Eastern Mennonite took the
lead for good against reliever
By Steele.

The squad was swept by
Randolph-Macon on Saturday
by scores of 4-3 and 9-0. In the

first game the Randolph Macon
was able to score four runs
despite the solid four hit pit-
ching of Chip Childs. The se-
cond game saw Coach Joseph
Lyles experimenting by putting
third basemen Ted Hissey on
the mound. Against
Bridgewater on Monday, the
Generals lost in a slugfest by
the score of 13-7.

The Generals record now

stands at 3-13 overall and 2-8 in”

ODAC play. Already
elimenated from post season
play, the Generals will round
out their 1978 season with a
doubleheader at VMI on Sunday
and a single game at Liberty
Baptist on Saturday, May 6.

up a schedule that would have
given us a 32-0 record but he
didn’t want to. He’s made us
play these tough Division I
teams so that when we go to
Delaware in May for the na-
tionals we will be playing well.”’
The Generals now have a 7-9
record .against these Division I
teams, but have made even the
defeats quite memorable.
“Every one of the teams that
we have played this year has
had scholarship players,”’ notes
Cody, ‘‘and that’s what makes it
mean so much when we defeat
them, or just give them a good
fight. For instance at Georgia
Tech, even though we lost 5-4,
the match came right down to

the last set of the last match.
And Alabama is ranked in the
upper 15 in the country Division
I, but we took two matches from
them and had a couple of three
set matches. We are playing
well against these teams and
they respect us; every one of
them has asked us to come back
next year.”’

Cody is cautiously optimistic
about the Nationals, in May
Stating: ‘‘There_ will be
pressure on us because we are
the number one team, but, with
all of this tough playing we’ve
had, we should do well.”

The Generals will host
George Mason on Tuesday and
go to Roanoke for a match there
on Thursday.

Track And Field Team Beats
Lynchburg And Mennonite

by William B. Sherwin

The track Generals won again
on last Friday, defeating Lyn-
chburg and Eastern Mennonite
College 73-59'2-48'% at Wilson
Field. In conditions that are
best described as a mudbath,
the Generals pulled out a meet
that looked for awhile as if it
was really going to be tough.

Coach Norris Aldridge was
again delighted with his team’s
performance. “‘The team was
psyched for Lynchburg! They
are a really big rival for us, and
last year they won the outdoor
ODAC championship. right now
they hold the indoor title as
well.”

Apparently the key to the
team’s success this year is
depth. Only five first places
were recorded for the Generals,
but their were numerous se-
cond, third, and fourth places.

Captain Jack Norberg led the

gett

Generals in the victory, easily
capturing the 100 and 220, as
well as anchoring the 440 relay,
and the mile relay. Rich Byrd’s
performance _ particuliarly
pleased Aldridge. ‘Rich is just
coming off tondonitis and ran a
good time of 4.24.5 in the mile,”
he said. co-captain Norville
Scott did well, taking second
place in the 120 high hurdles,
the 440 hurtles, and fourth in the
triple jump. In the three mile
run, Al Weeks took second to a
“really tough competitor from
Eastern Mennonite,” according
to Aldridge.

Another second place was
recorded by R. J. Scaggs witha
time of 51.8. ‘Scaggs has done a
good job for us. He is just com-
ing from the basketball team,
and has only been with us about
a month,” said Aldridge. Once
again the mile relay team of
Bill Morris, R. J. Scaggs, Henry

Hairston, and Jack Norberg
won in their event, as did the 440
relay team of Jeff Brown, Cris
Leiser, Stew Atkinson, and Jack
Norberg. Karl Cheatham won
the triple jump with a leap of
44’2”’. W&L’s javelin team did
very well, with Jeff Slatcoff tak-
ing second Scott Swope taking
third, and Car] Kirkpatrick tak-
ing fourth. “Those fellows real-
ly came tho) through for us”’
said Aldridge.

The team’s next trial is in the
ODAC meet. “Bridgewater is
the team to beat,’ claims
Aldridge. ‘‘We could win it,
depending on the number of se-

cond and third places we win.”

Depth will determine who will
win the ODAC meet.

The conference championship
will be held at Emory and
Henry College at 11:00 this com-
ing Saturday.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Notes from the Sandbox

It can no longer be said that apathy permeates this
campus. The students showed Monday they were will-
ing to speak out for what they believe in and demand
what they have been told is theirs. This year’s student
body elections are another indication of an end to
apathy. It is about time.

Students should begin to realize just how many
rights they actually have. Since Washington and Lee
is a private institution, the students have exactly
ZERO rights legally. In practice though, we have the
rights the university so deems to give us and ac-
cording to the handbooks and catalogues floating
around campus, it would seem W&L students have a
self-run life and government.

Whoever devised the present system of student
government was a genius. The students have been put
in a little box to play as much and as hard as they
want until they start to throw dirt or come out of the
box before graduation. Then the administration
begins exerting pressure to stop misbehaving and get
back in the system of rules they have given the
students to play in.

It is when the university tries to step in the box and
change the rules it has given that the students must
rise up, as they did Monday, and claim what is theirs.
The university must be required to Keep its promises.
Precedents must not be set concerning students
rights and whenever the administration attempts to
put controls on student behavior, students must
demonstrate their views to prevent the university
from overstepping its self-made bounds.

kkk ke

The SAB has made a good choice for its Spring Con-
cert. Harry Chapin is a nice mellow performer who
will give the students their money’s worth. It is too hot
to dance in the Spring and with Chapin’s music, you
can just lay back and enjoy. It would be nice if the
SAB could arrange to hold it outside.

kkk

Finally, thanks to the students who supported me
Monday. I know many of you disagree with my
political views, but you showed a greater concern for
principle than personal bias. You made the year.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry

Dear Editor,

We are law students whose
use of the gym was curtailed
during the undergraduate exam
and vacation weeks. We write to
offer a thank you to Athletic
Director McHenry, who went
out of his way to make facilities
available for those of us who
were still here.

Whether or not the pool and
other facilities remained open
was not an earthshaking mat-
ter. Now that there has been
enough interest shown in keep-
ing them open, several simple
solutions can be tried next year
to avoid the manpower and in-
surance problems that now ex-
ist.

A more serious problem, that
of attitudes, is not solved easily.
Our attempts to gain informa-
tion and to express our view-
points brought out two sharply
contrasting responses. One type
treated every question as a
challenge to authority, replying
only that, ‘‘this is the way it’s
done, that’s why...if you don’t
like it, too bad...it’s only for a
week or two...I don’t want to
talk about it any more...if you
can’t fit eight people into the
small pool, you aren’t using
your ingenuity.’’ So much for
‘ nlightened discussion.

Fortunately, Coach McHenry
doesn’t indulge in trite word
games. Instead, he took time to
listen, gave us valid reasons for
the current situation, and sug-
gested concrete ways to prevent
a recurrence next year.
Moreover, he donated his own
time to give us temporary
relief. For all these efforts we
thank him.

We are pleased, of course,
that Coach McHenry agreed
with us; we are far more pleas-
ed that he took the time to look
at it from our point of view. The
matter was one of irritation and
inconvenience, representative
of many minor problems
generated by the friction from
two timetables, two age groups,
and two social structures. It
also brought out two possible
ways of dealing with those pro-
blems.

: An open mind is not a solution
in itself. It may well be a prere-

quisite to any viable solution of
the ‘“‘gap’’ problems between
the law school and the
undergraduate school, student
body, and administration.

To the Editor of the Rank Tam
Poon,

Congratulations on another
fine display of student jour-
nalism talent through the
medium of a_ student
newspaper. I was very curious
to see just what contents a
‘Rank Tam Poon’’ would con-
tain in it. Once I had read the
front of the Ring-tum Phi, I
could make very little sense of
the Rank Tam Poon, even after
it was pointed out to me that I
was reading it upside down.

The trouble with the student
newspaper this year is that it
bas been almost impossible to
separate fact from nonfact in
the publication. Your
newspaper is so disordered as
to what is actually news and
what is actually sensationalism
(as in past issues) or what is ac-
tually glorified pornography
(as in the preceeding issue),
that it is very difficult to
distinguish that which is worth
reading from that which is not
worth reading.

One cannot say that all of the
RtP’s articles have been of no
value. Some of the topics that
the paper’s crusades have
covered are topics that have
needed discussion. My question
is this: have your actions as
editor been consistent with your
editorial positions?

Wherryou were actively cam-
paigning for the abolition of
closed meetings for all EC sub-
commitees a few months ago,
you made several accusations
to myself and the SAB. Permit
me to quote from your editorial
of January 19 with one slight
modification—that of
substituting your name and
position for mine. May I quote-
“Perhaps Mr. Gallagher has
forgotten just what his job is
supposed to be. The Editor of

the Ring-tum Phi _ should
guarantee that the student body
has been solicited adequately
for opinion. The Ring-tum Phi
should try to bring news to cam-
pus pleasing to all.”’

That is the responsibility as
out lined by your editorial. Are
you exempt from the demands
that you place on heads of other
committees? If you are ex-
empt, upon what basis do you
claim exemption? If you are
not exempt, why do you not
follow through on your demands
that you place on heads of other
committees? How much stu-
dent opinion was solicited
before tha decision was made to
print the Rank Tam Poon?

The Student Handbook says
that “Washington and Lee’s
weekly newspaper, the Ring-
tum Phi, is devoted to student
and faculty news and opinion.”’
One could ask if a proper
balance has been set between
devotion to opinion and repor-
ting of news. It further says that
“higher positions on the staff
come after the demonsration of
talent, diligence, and ability.’’ I
cannot question the diligence
that the paper has shown in pur-
suing some of its crusades, but I
certainly can question the
demonstration of talent and
ability as shown in the final
publication of those crusading
articles.

You seem to enjoy participa-
tion in battles brought about by
your paper. You won your bat-
tle with the Publications Board
on Monday when they did not
remove you as editor of the
paper. I must warn you not to
misinterpret this action as an
endorsement of your paper. I
think that it would have been
improper to dismiss you on the
basis of one issue, but I feel that
it is also improper that the Pub
Board did not issue some
declaration of disapproval of
the Rank-tam Poon being
issued as a_ student body
publication without first con-
sulti ng students as to whether
or not they approve of such a
publication.

Another battle you engaged in
was for the presidency of the
student body. One campaign

a step toward improving the
product,’’ Gallagher said ex-
plaining the rational behind the
“Jampoon”’ newspaper. He said
the Rank-tam Poon had been an
attempt to “laugh at the pro-
blems we’ve had during the
year. If we can’t laugh at
ourselves, then that’s the real
problem.”

“This year has not been a
crusade to vent Mike
Gallagher’s frustrations,’’ said
Temp Webber, editor of this
year’s Calyx. Webber said the
joke issue was an attempt to
provide ‘‘something for
everybody; it was something
for people to sit back and en-
joy.”

Ryland Owen, chairman of
the Publications Board, added
his own opinion that the Rank-
tam Poon exhibited a “pure
lack of taste.”

Potter expressed concern
that his younger sister would
see the newspaper since his
parents had a subscription to
the Ring-tum Phi.

(To block mailing of the April
20 issue to subscribers, the ad-
ministration refused the Ring-
tum Phi’s postal permit.)

Potter also felt Gallagher had
overstepped his bounds as
newspaper editor by publishing
the ‘“‘lampoon’’ issue. Potter
argued that Gallagher was a
“newspaper editor, not the
editor of a ‘humor magazine’”’
(as the Rank-tam Poon describ-
ed itself).

‘We feel the Board is being
pressured by the administra-
tion,’”’ Webber charged.

Robert S. Keefe, director of

the University News Office and |

administration representative
on the Publications Board,.
denied that the administration
had taken a _ stand on
Gallagher’s removal.

(Keefe had issued a Universi-
ty statement on April 21
apologizing for the Rank-tam
Poon issue of the newspaper
calling it ‘‘distasteful,
disgusting, and a disgrace to
the University.”’ He added his
own “personal statement” in
the final paragraph which noted
Gallagher’s “recklessness and
utter lapse of taste and judge-
ment.”’)

Owen also said that no
pressure had been put on the
Board by the administration,
although he later said he had
received a note Friday from
Dean Lewis John urging that
the Pub. Board meet Monday to
discuss the Rank-tam Poon.

Gallagher said, however, that
in a telephone call he made to
Washington and Lee University
president R.E. R. Huntley
Saturday, the implication was

that the administration did seek .

his removal. ‘I said: ‘With the
publication of (Keefe’s April 21
letter), I feel the administration
has taken direct steps to affect
my removalas editor’.”’

“That is undoubtably true
Mr. Gallagher,” the editor said
Huntley replied.

Peter Goss, business
manager of the Ring-tum Phi,
said he had called Keefe Friday
morning to express his dismay
about the Rank-tam Poon, and
say that he thought the remain-
ing copies should be picked up.

As far as he knew, Keefe had
not acted on his request.

“I am responsible for the
paper’s circulation and the
finanical future of the Ring-tum
Phi,” explained Goss. The
business manager said he felt
the Rank-tam Poon would hurt
advertising revenue, although
he admitted that “‘at this point
in time, I have not had a chance
to hear any reactions’ from
advertisers.

“How can the advertisers
react to the issue if they haven’t
seen it?” Gallagher inter-
jected.

Goss said advertisers would
receive the: official apology of
the University and would be of-
fered compensation, but he
would not show them the issue.
“This is not the sort of issue
advertisers pay to advertise
in,” he said.

Dave McLean, last year’s
Ring-tum Phi business
manager, and other Pub. Board
members objected to Gallagher
“not having forewarned peo-
ple” that the April 20 publica-
tion would be a lampoon issue.
In that connection, Parker Pot-
ter said the advertisers had
been ‘‘defrauded.”’

However, it was not until the
student audience was allowed to
speak that anyone suggested
Goss should have warned the
advertisers, not Gallagher. It
was revealed during the au-
dience’s questioning that Goss
had known in advance that the
April 20 issue would be a lam-
poon, although he said he had
not known how far it would go.

It was also revealed during
the questioning period that

Se ee

Friday, April 28-Noon-Midnight

there had been a “large in-
crease” in the Ring-tum Phi’s
advertising this year over last,
although Goss attributed the in-
crease to the work of the
business staff rather than a
general improvement in the
quality of the paper itself.

Members of the audience at-
tending the meeting were allow-
ed to comment and ask ques-
tions after Bird’s motion to
remove Gallagher had been
seconded.

Gallagher’s supporters spoke
of the overall improvement of
the newspaper under his editor-
ship, and suggested that the
Pub. Board should not remove
Gallagher because of offensive
parts “‘of just one issue’’ of the
paper. Many students thought
the idea behind the lampoon
issue was good, even though
some found certain parts
“crude.”

The major concern of many
questioners was the location of
the missing copies of the
newspaper, believed to be
600-1,200 copies. Owen promised
to appoint a committee to in-
vestigate the situation.

For the most part, Gallagher
let the crowd speak in his
defense. ‘‘All I have to say is
take the Ring-tum Phi this year
and compare it to the past two
years, then throw me out,” the
editor said to the Pub. Board.
“Just because we put out one
joke issue, you want to hang
me,” he added.

But the student audience’s
turnout to Gallagher’s defense
had a visable impact on the
Board’s decision. One and one
half hours after the meeting

Gallagher’s Fate Uncertain

EC Votes to Retain
Gallagher Tuesday

Pub Board

Fires

Editor Mon.

by Jim Barnes

Six members of the Publica-
tions Board voted to remove
Mike Gallagher as the Ring-
tum Phi editor at a meeting on
Monday. Two members sup-
ported Gallagher’s retention for
the one more Phi he was to put
out before Gray Coleman
assumes his responsibilities as
the new editor-in-chief. One
member abstained. The ballot
was cast in secret.

The two-thirds majority re-
quired to remove Gallagher as
the editor was achieved after
the Pub Board debated the issue
for over two hours in an open
meeting on the third floor of
Tucker Hall.

The motion to remove
Gallagher was presented by
Parker Potter and seconded by
Jeff Bird. Potter based his
resolution primarily on the
grounds that Gallagher had
“radically changed the format
(of the Phi) without talking to
the Pub Board.’’ Potter said
that as the publisher of the Phi,
the Pub Board should have been
informed of the contents of the
lampoon issue, because they
ultimately must assume the
responsibility for the articles in
theRing-tum Phi.

Potter also charged that
advertisers had been “‘defraud-
ed” when their ads turned up
along side lampoon stories
rather than regular stories.
Bird said that when he and Pub
Board President Ryland Owen
took the Rank-tam Poon to
those who advertised in the
issue, the advertisers claimed
with the exception of one, they
didn’t want their ads in the
Poon, and would not have
advertised in the issue had they

known beforehand of the nature -

of the lampoon issue.

Randy Smith, Phi news
editor, disputed Potter’s ac-
cusations that important stories
were sacrificed at the expense
of legitimate news stories.
Smith said that the stories that
were not included in the non-
lampoon section of the Phi were
not “‘time relevant.”’

Last year’s Calyx editor,
Chris Volk, wanted to clarify
the basis of the motion calling
for Gallagher’s. removal as
predicated solely on his fiscal
irresponsibility. The Pub Board
reimbursed all of the adver-
tisers in the lampoon issue.
With respect to the content of
the Phi, and Gallagher’s
removal, Volk said. ‘“‘You can’t
dismiss an editor for something
subjective.”

Volk claimed that Gallagher
cost the Phi about $300 in reim-

(continued on page 7).

by Randy Smith

The Executive Committee
has taken the initial step toward
reversing the Publications
Board’s decision to remove J.
Michael Gallagher as editor of
the Ring-tum Phi. The Pub.
Board fired Gallagher Monday
for his “irresponsibility” in
printing the April 20 joke issue,
the Rank-tam Poon.

At a specially called meeting
Tuesday afternoon, the EC
voted 8-4 to reinstate Gallagher
as editor of the student
newspaper. The vote reflects
the two-thirds majority re-
quired of the EC before they can
overturn the Pub. Board’s
removal vote.

However, a second vote is re-
quired before Washington and
Lee’s student government can
constitutionally overrule the
Pub. Board’s decision and
reinstate Gallagher. The EC
has delayed the second vote un-

_ til next Monday night.

 

“I don’t believe in giving people
their money back until they ask
for it.”

J.M.G.

 

Jim Underhill, president of
the EC, urged the six day wait
“to give Gray Coleman (next
year’s Ring-tum Phi editor)
some experience putting out the
paper”’ and to give the students
time to react to the Executive
Committee’s action.

Parker Potter, editor of Ariel
and the Pub. Board member
who initiated the vote for
Gallagher’s removal Monday,

stated the Publications Board’s

position on the firing.

“The editor of the Ring-tum
Phi is an agent of the Publica-
tions Board’’ and is_ thus

“responsible to the Pub.
Board,’’ Potter said. He also

said that the editor has a
responsibility to his adver-
tisers, the subscribers, and the
students.

“The Rank-tam Poon was a
‘humor magazine’ not a
newspaper’’ which represented
a “major change in format,”
Potter continued. ‘‘Money was
obtained from advertisers
under the false pretense that
their ads would appear in a
newspaper,’’ he said.

He charged Gallagher with
“fiscal irresponsibility’? and
said the editor ‘‘cost the Ring-
tum Phi$300’’ with the lampoon
issue. “‘The Publications Board
can no longer accept respon-
sibility for the actions of
Michael Gallagher,” Potter
concluded.

Gallagher refuted the
charges by saying, ‘don’t
blame the $300 loss on me.” He
reminded the Board that the
decision to refund the adver-
tisers for ads placed in the
Rank-tam Poon issue had been
made by the Pub. Board last
Monday, before any advertiser
reaction had been registered.

“T don’t believe in giving peo-
ple their money back until they
ask for it,’’ Gallagher said. “‘I
didn’t slur (the advertisers’)
names or hurt their business.”
In fact, he added, ‘‘that paper
has given the advertisers more
exposure” because of all the
controversy.

Potter said the Rank-tam
Poon ‘‘was not a newspaper”
and that Gallagher had
“drastically altered the format
of the Ring-tum Phi. “It’s as if
we had charged you with the du-
ty of printing a newspaper and
you printed a roadmap,” he
said.

“My contention is that (the
April 20 issue) was a
newspaper, and the Rank-tam
Poon was a feature section of

NUMBER 27

 

 

To Speak May 16

The Contact Committee an-
nounced yesterday the signing
of former Senator Sam J. Irvin

Jr. to appear in Lee Chapel on.

Tuesday, May 16. The an-
nouncement, made by co-
chairmen Billy Webster and
Walter Granruth, marks the
end of this year’s Contact
presentation.

Irvin is best known for his roll
in the Senate hearings dealing
with Watergate. He chaired the
Senate Judiciary Committee
and presided over the televised
Watergate hearings. He retired
from the senate in 1974 after 20
years of public service in that
body.

Irvin was born in Morgan-
town, North Carolina on
September 27, 1896. He was

educated first at The University
of North Caolina at Chapel Hill
and later at Harvard Universi-
ty, where he received his law
degreein 1922.

Irvin’s Senate activities go all
the way back to his involvement
on the Select Committee to In-
vestigate Censure Charges
Against the late Senator Joseph
McCarthy. At his retirement, he
was involved in the work of a
couple of committees, including
the Goverment Operations
Committee, of which he was
chairman, and the Judicary
Committee, of which he was the
second ranking Democrat.

The May 16 presentation by

_the former senator will begin at

8:00 in Lee Chapel.

“It is my duty to print

said the Ring-tum Phi under his
editorship has been ‘readable,
informative, and entertaining;
it has provoked discussion and
brought forth issues.”

Junior EC representative Jim
Davis asked if Gallagher felt he
owed anything to the reputation
of Washington and Lee.

“This is not a question of
ethics,’ Chris Volk, a member
ol the Pub. Board, said. He con-
tended that Gallagher should
have gotten the Publications
Board's approval before prin-
ting the lampoon issue because
the Pub. Board ultimately
shared the responsibility for the
newspaper's content.

“We didn't feel the Rank-tam

had to consult the.Pub. Board;
we put out something we felt
wouldn't hurt the paper,”’
Gallagher said,

should consult with the Pub.
Board before publication only

tially libelous or hurt adver-
lisers,

before the EC vote, Gallagher
charged the Fublications
Board’s decision to dismiss him
as editor ‘‘a reaction against
my liberal point of view.”’

He called the Rank-tam Poon
‘‘a satire’ and ‘‘a statement on
life here at Washington and
Lee. They (the Pub. Board)
jumped on this issue and blew it
out of proportion.”’

Gallagher warned the EC that
if the firing was upheld, it would
“discourage any budding jour-
nalist who aspires to be editor of
the Ring-tum Phi.”

Each Executive Committee
member was given the op-
portunity to express his views.

“I am not satisfied that the
Pub. Board had _ sufficient

reason to remove Mike
Gallagher,’ said Tom Healy,
law school representative.
“removal at this point does not
serve any purpose because
Michael would only have a few
more issues to put out,”” he con-
tinued.

Healy also said that the EC
“must insure” that future
editors are not discouraged by
the Pub. Board’s vote to remove
Gallagher, who he characteriz-
ed as ‘‘an aggressive editor.”

Jackie Boyden concurred,
calling the Pub. Board’’s deci-
sion a ‘‘drastic move’’ based on
“insufficient allegations.”’

‘Mike has done a good job
this year,’’ said sophomore
representative Steve Abraham,

although Gallagher’s failure to
tell his business manager about

the lampoon was “‘irresponsi-
ble.”

‘I'd hate to see him kicked off
because it would set a precident
where we can’t manage
ourselves and our newspaper,”’
said Andy Bodenstab,
sophomore representative.

Jim Davis was not worried
about the precident of removing
an editor, but was ‘‘concerned
with Mike Gallagher’s bad
judgement” and “‘his attitude.”

Neil Pentifallo, EC secretary
said Gallagher “overstepped
his bounds” in printing the
Rank-tam Poon. “Either the
editor uses good judgement or
he is removed; the advertisers
were in a sense defrauded,” he
said.

“The Pub. Board gave the
money back to the advertisers,
then blamed Mike,” said Doug
Perkins, senior representative.

The other senior represen-
tative, Mike Missel, said,
‘“‘What bothers me most is the
indecisiveness of the Pub.
Board; this is something that
has been brewing all year.”

“‘The Pub. Board has backed

all of Michael’s decisions this
year,” said Jack Bovay, junior

representative. He said that the
Board had been ‘‘negligent”’ in
not educating Gallagher on his
duties as editor.

“This particular charge (of
fiscal irresponsibility) is not 100
percent founded,’’ said
freshman representative Chris
Gammon.

EC president Jim Underhill
said that the Publications
Board “‘had not presented its
case very well.”’ He noted that
the newspaper itself ‘is in some
amount of turmoil’’ (with last
week’s firing of Gray Coleman
from Gallagher’s staff).

Underhill noted the irony of
Gallagher’s situation as the
editor who crusaded for student

organization leaders being
responsible to the students, but
being charged himself with ‘‘ir-
responsibility.”

“‘T would not want to overturn
the Pub. Board’s decision, but I
would not want you to continue
as editor,” he said.

Vice-president George Griffin
reminded the committee that it
was not their position to ‘‘decide
what is good or bad jour-
nalism,”’ but to vote on the basis
of the Pub. Board’s action.

The EC motion to overturn
the Publications Board’s deci-
sion to remove Gallagher as
editor of the Ring-tum Phiwill
face its final and crucial test
next Monday evening,

Next Year’s Rush Extended

In a recent IFC meeting, it
was announced that the ad-
ministration at W&L has
agreed to a revised Rush calen-
dar for 1978, which would ex-
tend the rushing period over
five weekends.

The calendar, as outlined by
IFC Rush Chairman Chris Volk,
runs as follows: Freshmen will
arrive for orientation Wednes-
day, Sept. 6; Open House
registration will be Friday and
Saturday, Sept. 8 & 9; Open
Houses will occur the weekend
of Sept. 911; and the Rush
Dates — eight in all — will fall
on the next four Friday nights,
Sept. 15, 22, 29, and Oct. 6.
Préference cards will be due
Oct. 9.

Basically, the source of both
the problem and the change is
the first set of Rush Dates. Held
for years on the first Wednes-
day after Open House, it was
moved last year to Monday (the
night after the last Open House)

to remove distraction on aclass _

night. Now, it has again been
moved to Friday, leaving one

entire week between Open
Houses and the first Rush
Dates. The ‘‘no contact rule’
will prevail in the intervening
days — except Wednesday
night, Sept. 13, 7-12 p.m.

In other business, the IFC
continued to place no limit on
beer served during Rush. But
there is a consensus pushing to
raise the $1500 limit on bands
that has been the rule.

One final suggestion was
brought forward by Charlie
Brown of FIST, that the IFC
may very well adopt: a summer
newsletter to freshmen concer-
ning the mechanics of Rush.
“Emphasis would be on the
hard facts — benefits as well as

financial costs. It would not in-
clude pitches from the in-
dividual houses, but will be a
central, IFC-based view. It will
serve a purpose different from
the Rush book, which will be
distributed earlier — at Natural
Bridge.”’

Fraternity freshmen are to
eat the evening meal at their
fraternity houses on Tuesday,
May 9, in lieu of their regular
night at the house. The Senior
Banquet is being held on Tues-
day night , and NO MEALS will

Harry Chapin’s first solo
album, recorded after years of

rather unsuccessful
with his brothers in ‘The
Chapins,”” was a tremendous
success, and is still regarded as
one of his best albums.

This album features his big-
gest hit, ‘“Taxi,’’ which he
claims is about sixty percent
true. Many of Chapin’s songs
are partially true, or at least
based on truth, and blend that

singing

with the painful realization of
what became of his dreams:
‘And me, I’m flying in my taxi;
taking tips, and getting stoned ‘‘
Also on this album are a
number of FM radio favorites,
such as “Greyhound,” ‘Any
Old Kind of Day,’ and
“Dogtown.”

SHORT STORIES — Elektra

Chapin’s third album
represents a better effort than
its perdecessor; there are
nothing but vintage Chapin
songs on this one. ‘Short
Stories’”’ contains Harry’s se-
cond hit, ‘“‘Wold,” a song about
a travel-weary disco jockey try-
ing to settle again with his old
wife.

The album’s masterpiece is
“Mr. Tanner,” a deceivingly
simple song about a clothes
cleaner from Ohio who goes to
New York to try to become a
professional baritone, and fails.
In another song of note on this
album, “They Call Her Easy,”
Chapin looks into the heart of a
girl who is rather ‘‘easy,’’ and
finds that she is better than
most people. His conclusion:
‘Dream of the kind of world it
could be if we were free with
our love like Easy.”

Theatre forms stock company

of the university community.

The company, under the
leadership of director Al Gor-
don and business manager-
designer Tom Ziegler, will be
presenting a trio of plays with
an 1890’s flavor, running
through July 9. In addition to
Mary Sunshine, the company
will present productions ofRip
Van Winkle (a 19th century
dramatization of the
Washington Irving story) and
Thornton Wilder’s The Mat-
chmaker — that farce which at-
tained even greater success as
the musical Hello, Dolly on
stage and screen.

The total theatre classes are
forming the full staff for com-
pany, in its spring-term period.
If successful, the Henry Street
Playhouse may become a
regular summer activity for the
theatre. But after this year, it
would no longer be joined with
the regular total theatre cur-
riculum. ‘‘The idea this spring
was merely to build the com-
pany — construct the sets,
establish good PR with the local

hotels and merchants, and so
forth,’”’ said Dr. Gordon.

Many of the total theatre
students will continue to staff
the production in the summer.
But there are still many posi-
tions open for the summer;
company members will also
receive a basic salary of $50 a
week for the 6-week run. This
amount is based on the estimate
of a two-thirds full house of pay-
ing viewers nightly. If atten-
dance grows any higher, the ex-
tra profit will be divided among
the company. There has been no
casting at allfor Rip Van Winkle
or The Matchmaker; also Little
Mary Sunshine will have some
necessary cast replacements
for the summer presentations.

So if you’re looking for sum-
mer employment for June and
July, auditions for the summer
will be held next Sunday, Mon-
day, and Tuesday, May 7-9, at
3:30 pm. (The Sunday audition
will be held in the Troubadour
Theatre; the next two days’
auditions will be in the Boiler
Room.)

WLUR Notice

On May 4 at 11:00 p.m. WLUR
will present a special in-depth
look at new wave featuring two
of the hottest bands from Bri-
tain: The Jam and The
Stranglers. New wave is cur-
rently the most controversial
phenomenon in the music in-
dustry. New wave uses a lyrical
base of the seventies with
musical influences of the six-
ties.

The Jam is a three man outfit
patterned after the early Who,
and The Stranglers will remind
you of the Doors during their
peak period. Both bands were
recorded in their native habitat-
England.

Tennis Team 9-10
Home Meet Sat.

by Mike Farrand

The tennis team has played
two matches since last Thurs-
day, one against the College of
William and Mary and the other
against George Mason Univer-
sity. With their 7-2 loss to W&M
and reciprocating 7-2 victory
over George Mason, the
Generals have updated thei
record to 9-10 and _ placed
themselves in a good position
for a winning season.

“We leveled off by intent
after the ODAC tournament and
now we're regaining our
momentum,”’ says recently
named ODAC Coach of the Year
Dennis Bussard. “We could
have played a little sharper
against William and Mary, but
they have the best team they’ve
had in years,’ continued the
coach. Bussard went on to say
that he felt the team would have
a good shot in the Nationals if
they continue to play this well,
despite the pressure put on the
team because of the number
one ranking. _

At William and Mary last Fri-
day the only victory points for
W&L came from-the number
two man, Stewart Jackson, and
the number one doubles team,
which consists of Jackson and
Ben Johns. Jackson beat Robert
Galloway 6-3,2-6,6-2, while the
team of Jackson and John beat
the team of Mare Abrams and
Galloway 6-2, 7-6.0ther singles
scores were Ben Johns losing to
W&M’s Abrams 6-2, 6-4, Cody

W&L’s number one man beat
the three time All-American

ultimately outlasted his oponent
Richard Lemoine 4-6,6-2,6-3 .

Bussard is the first to point
out that W&L will not nessarily
do well in the Nationals just
because they are the nation’s
top rated team. “It’s a three
day affair and anything can
happen. It all depends on who
can play well those days and
who we draw,’’ explains
Bussard about the uncertainty
of the May 17-20 tournament.
“We could get a horrendous
draw and bomb out,”’ he states.
He is optimistic however
because of the strength of at
least three or four players he is
taking, Johns, Jackson, and
Davis being the ones mention-
ed.

The Generals are away at
Roanoke today, will play will
play Randolph-Macon at 1:00 on

Generals Win One, Lose One;
Meet Rutgers Sat.

by Sandy Bishop

Paced by the offensive pro-
duction by Richard Graham
and the acrobatics of goalie
John Sullivan, the Maroons of
Roanoke held off Washington
and Lee’s stickman for a 14-11
victory yesterday on Wilson-
Field.

Roanoke spotted W&L a 1-0
lead, and then raced to a 7-1 ad-
vantage as Graham had six
assists in the scoring spree. The
Generals narrowed the verdict
to 7-4 at the half as Jeff Fritz
and Jay Sindler converted on
beautifuldodges and Rob
Eisdorfer made a good feed to
Johnny Black.

W&L swarmed on the
Maroon goal to open the third
quarter and goals by Black and
Sindler made it 7-6 with 13:38
left in the period.

But the Maroons then tallied
three straight, two by Dale
Chesser, and they then lead 10-6
with 22 minutes to play.

Individual efforts by Black
and Charley Stieff cut the gap to
10-8, but Sullivan then took
over. Replacing starter John
Neurohr to open the third-
quarter, Sullivan proved the dif-
ference in the fourth quarter as
well as in the last minute of the
third quarter.

Following W&L’s eighth goal,
the Generals got the ball back
and stormed the Roanoke goal
again. But with his best save of
the day, Sullivan cut off the
angle on Geoff Brent’s shot on
the right side of the goal, and
then threw himself across the
cage to stop Black’s follow up
from the left side.

The Generals slipped behind
12-8 before Black scooped up a
ground ball and made it 12-9
with7:53 left.

But Sullivan then rejected at-
tempts by Fritz and Sindler.
George Park’s goal with 2:14
leftmade it 13-9 and _ the
Generals were out of time.

Johnny BLack led W&L with
four goals and two assists while
Sindler had two goals.

While the Generals were
frustrated by Roanoke Wednes
day, things ended on a happier
not eon last Saturday.

Following a first have of drop-
ped passes and fast break op-

portunities that were missed,
W&L’s defense stopped the
Shoremen of Washington Col-
lege in the second half. Black’s
three second have goals led the
Generals to a 9-6 victory on
Wilson Field.

The General’s stickman
played well in the first half but
had real troubles trying to con-
vert fast breaks. ‘‘We must
have had eight fast breaks that
we didn’t convert in the first
quarter,’’said Coach Jack Em-
mer. The playing of Washington
goalie Tim Hart also stymied
the play of the Generals too, as
he had 12 saves in the first half
He later had to leave the game
because of a rib injury.

W&L held a narrow 3-2 ad-
vantage after the first quarter,
but Washington College, led by
G. P. lindsey and his antics
directed to Charlie Brown, did
all thescoring in the second
quarter and led 5-3 at half. At
this point in the game, W&L
defenseman Jim Herbert went
down but came back in the
game later on.

The Generals defense led by
Brown and Chris Walsh, put the

 

second half. Washington was
held te one goal and was unsuc-
cessful in six extra man at-
tempts. ‘On the whole, the
defense has been a tremendous
plus during the season,’ Em-
mer Said. ;

At the other end of the field,
W&L pumped six shots by Cint
Evans, who was put in a tough
spot as Harts replacement, but
did a credible job. Three of the
tallies came from Black.
Washington’s Lindsey narrow-
ed the margin to 8-6 with 6:57
left, but the Generals were not
to be overtaken.

Not only did the Generals out-
shoot the sroeman 57-41, but
W&L outscooped Washington
College on ground balls and nar-
rowly edged them in faceoffs,
10-9.

Now ranked eighth in the na-
tion, W&L faces a tough opo-
nent in the Scarlet Knights of
Rutgers on Saturday. The
Knights are ranked fifth this
week following a one goal loss to
number one Cornell. The game
Saturday is a must win for the
Generals if they entertain any
notions of post season play-off
berth.

Brown saves one against Washington College; they were harder to
come by against Roanoke.

Track Team Does Poorly In ODAC
Tournament - Meets Winner On Friday

by Bill Sherwin

Coach Norris Aldridge seem-
ed a little depressed Tuesday
morning as he discussed his
team’s performance in_ the
ODAC Track and Field cham-
pionships at Emory and Henry
College. The Generals had
finished in sixth place in a field
of seven teams. The overall
results were Bridgewater in
first win 78.5 points, Lynchburg
with 61.5, E&H with 37.5, EMC
with 36, Roanoke with 28, W&L
with 27.5, and Hampden-Sydney
bringing up the rear with 2.

‘‘We just had a bad day,”’ said
Aldridge. “For example, in
what could have been a victory
in the 440 relay’ we dropped the

baton. Little things like that
really hurt us.” Nevertheless,
Aldridge insists the team per-
formed at a fairly satisfactory
level. Bob Hoffman recorded
his best effort of the year in the
triple jump with a leap of 44’6’,
while Karl Cheatham set his
own school record of 46’2”’. Jack
Norberg finished second in both
the 100 meters and 200 meter
races.

Other standouts mentioned by
Aldridge include freshman R. J.
Scaggs, who took 4th place in
the 400 meters, while Norvell
Scott took third in the 400 meter
hurdle, and Paul Hendry took
third in the high jump. Baker

Springs took fifth place in the
pole vault, and of course,
Cheatham captured second
place in the triple jump. The
mile relay team of Scaggs, Bill

Morris, Stew Atkinson and Cap-
tain Jack Norberg finished in
second place.

The teams last meet of the
season is against Bridgewater
at 2:30 this Friday at
Bridgewater. ‘“‘Our kids are up
for it,”’ says Aldridge, ‘‘We will
need good performances from
our guys to do it, but it is possi-
ble we may beat them.’’ Last
year, Bridgewater edged W&L
in the ODAC championships,
but lost in the dual meet. It

should be an interesting con-
test.

WE&L graduate
bequests $150,000

to University

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has received a bequest of
$150,000 from the estate of the
late Lewis Waters Milbourne, a
Baltimore broadcasting  ex-
ecutive who died last year. The
bequest is designated for
W&L’s School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics.

Mr. Milbourne was a 1922
B.A. graduate of Washington
and Lee. After spending several
years in the real estate and in-
vestment banking fields, in 1938
he became general manager
and vice president of WACO,
then the CBS radio affiliate in
Baltimore. He died July 9, 1977,
after a long illness.

Baseball Team

Concludes Season Sat.

by Warren Drowdus

The Generals’ baseball team
came away with a split of a
doubleheader with Virginia
Military Institute on Sunday the
outcome of the two games were
in doubt until the final outs had
been recorded. Washington &
Lee won the opener, 3-2, and
dropped the nightcap in extra
innings by the same score.

The Generals pushed across
three first-inning runs in the
first game by dint of four VMI
errors and a Dan Kingman
single. Sophomore Chip Childs,
probably the most consistent
pitcher on Coach Lyles’ staff,
was able to hold the opposition
to only two runs, scattering
eight hits in the process. The
game was the nineteenth con-
secutive loss for the VMI squad.

VMI snapped the winless
skein with a cliffhanger win in
the finale. After the regulation
seven innings of play, the score
was knotted at two. VMI,
however, was able to touch
loser Vic Shepherd for a run in
the top of the eighth, W&L
didn’t die easily, though. With
one out in the bottom of the
eighth, the Generals had run-
ners on first and second with

Don Swaggert at the plate.
Swaggert hit a line shot right at
VMI pitcher Mike Davies, who
amazingly caught the ball
barehanded, and threw to first
to complete a game-ending dou-
ble play.

The split of the doubleheader
made the Generals’ log for the
season 4-14, 2-8 in the ODAC.
The team will conclude the
season on Saturday with a game
at Liberty Baptist College.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Business as usual...

It has been a time of rare actions...F or the first time in some five
years, the Publications Board voted to remove an editor before his
term of office had expired. Then, as if to top that, the EC overruled
this decision last Monday — one of their few instances of ‘‘pulling
rank”’ on the Pub Board. In the meantime, we all await the final
decision of the EC next Monday, and the staff for next year, with
very little warning, is rushed in to fill the breach. So, while we wait,
I feel it is important for the new staff and editor to express their
feelings.

Perhaps the greatest source of annoyance to me has been the in-
sistence that I or members of my staff were responsible for remov-
ing copies of the lampoon issue of April 20. It simply is not so.
Though unaware of some of the content, it is true that this writer
was a contributor that week, and in fact supported the parody con-
cept. And even though there were certain parts of that issue which
I, along with many individuals, found objectionable, I believe that,
in the end, opinions on these stories must be left up to the in-
dividuals’ own tastes.

It is not the job of the editorial staff to reclaim (or ‘‘seize,’’ if you
will) published copies, any more than it is our job to distribute
them. Personally, I am of the opinion that there is very little that
the average W&L student could have seen that would have caused
him any great loss of innocence. The Publications Board investiga-
tion seems to uncover the fact that the supposed ‘‘confiscation”’
was due to nothing more than faulty circulation at the outset, coupl-
ed with the nature of the paper, which led to its being picked up
quicker in high-traffic places like the Bookstore or Student Center.
Indeed, the sight of a person casually strolling the campus with
several hundred papers under his arm would be rather hard for
everyone on campus to miss, at noon on a school day. And the fact
that no eyewitness to the ‘“‘crime”’ has appeared in any of the inter-
minable hearings that we have had to sit through, would seem to
kill the story once and for all.

, te EH

The degree of anger shown by the students this week brings me to
another subject. I believe most will agree that no purpose at all
could have been served by mailing this issue to parental
subscribers. Their confusion would be understandable — after all,
how can you hope to understand a parody when you have little or no
experience of the original? I find it unfortunate, though, that there
was no better attempt made to circulate the paper among the
students. In fact, the students attending the various meetings this
week seemed most upset about the very fact that they had been
“protected”’ without their consultation, rather than over the
relative merits of the issue itself. As one said, ‘‘We pay for it; no
matter how good or bad it is, we havea right to receive it.”

It is very hard to believe how so much clamor ever developed
over something so trivial: the lampoon, the chreats on both sides,
the anonymous letters on the Colonnade. jt is indeed a time of
heroes, and we should all be proud.

In fairness to Mr. Gallagher, the following points are made. As
many of you know, he is the power behind the road race which gives
so much to MS — probably the greatest charitable effort by an in-
dividual in recent memory. Very few know that he took the editor-
ship at a crucial time, with the loss of the W&L Print Shop
facilities. Moreover, he succeeded in re-training an entire staff in
the unfamiliar surroundings of a new office and print shop, with a
100% larger format. Even so, the prospect of the EC jumping into
the controversy is not too soothing. It seems that something must
be lost here. Either the Publications Board loses its freedom to
make its decisions, or future editors lose the privilege to print what
they feel is just. Iam not overjoyed with the prospect.

As for our overriding sentiment here in the office, it was probably
best expressed by a disgruntled Jim Underhill, when he said, ‘This
paper has made more news than it has reported.”’ And, that is the
greatest injustice of all — the spectacle of the paper itself, forced
from the reporting of regular news stories to the necessary
coverage of this ‘‘canned controversy.”

Business as usual — the book should be closed, one way or the
other. Regardless of the decision to be made by the EC next week,
one would hope that the various parties would have the good grace
to let a dead dog lie.

LETTERS TO EDITOR
Students protest “parody”’

Dear Editor, Students, and
the Exexutive Committee,

The recent turmoil within the
Publications Board andRing-
tum Phi staff is an unfortunate
issue to be thrown at the
students, EC, and the ad-
ministration. The Pub Board
decided to remove Michael
Gallagher from the editor’s
chair because of fiscal irrespon-
sibility. The EC voted
marginally to overturn this
decision, as is within their
power.

In the EC meeting on Mon-
day, several issues pointing to
the support of the charges were
brought out. The Pub Board
sees four areas of responsibility
for the editor: (1) Responsibili-
ty to the students of printing a
student newspaper which, in
form, is a NEWSpaper, (2)
Responsibility to the adver-
tisers to print their ads per
previous agreements ontracts,
(3) Responsibility to the Pub
Board as the ultimate publisher
of the paper to print the news in
a manner set by their direction,
and to check out any large
movements from the norm with
them in advance, and (4)

 

   
   
     
       
   
   
   
   
   
   

Co-op employee
bids farewell

Dear Students, Faculty, Staff
and Alumni:

I want to say thank you for the
23 years of service that I work-
ed at W&L in the University
Supply Store. I have made
many friends and truly miss
seeing all the students and the
alumni that come from time to
time. My health has failed,
therefore I wasn’t able to return
to work in September.

Ican truly say, I don’t think
a person could have been
treated any nicer by the
students than I was.

I feel that I would like to see
each in person to say thanks for
helping to make my life such an
enjoyable one but since that is
impossible I’ll say ‘‘remember-
ing you all fondly.”

Always,

Kelcey Clemmer Chittum
Fairfield, Va. 24435

Responsibility to their
subscribers to deliver campus
news in the form of a student
newspaper.

Mike Gallagher was charged
and found guilty of violating
thses last three principles, and
deservedly so. He did not
deliver the form of newspaper
his advertisers had agreed to be
placed in, he did not consult the
Pub Board on the tremendous
change in format, and he did not
deliver a student newspaper to
his subscribers - as a result of
indulging in personal whims,
the administration revoked the
Phi’s mailing privilege.

To us, as students, he must
answer to the fourth charge as
well. Although he has been well
represented in all his hearings
by loud and_ distracting
students, there are still many
students who feel they were
denied what they consider to be
a student newspaper and who
feel that their money having
been spent to publish theRank-
tam Poon was a clear abuse of
the editor’s responsibility. We
are of this latter group.

After the evidence presented
by the Pub Board at the EC

hearing, we feel that the
Board’s decision must be
upheld. Gallagher did not con-
sult his advertisers informing
them that their ads would ap-
pear ina lampoon issue - and
several of them were reported
as shocked and disgusted at
having their ads appear in the
issue. Can clear irresponsibility
to one’s sponsors be covered up
with the line that as long as
some students liked it, it was
just?

He also neglected to tell the
Pub Board of any of these ac-
tions before the fact. In short,
his total ignorance of his
responsibilities to inform those
concerned in the financing of
theRing-tum Phi clearly shows
us that the Pub Board decision
should be upheld. The fact that
Mr. Gallagher has refused to
acknowledge any irresponsibili-
ty shows us further that he
should not be in any position
which requires responsibility to
the W&L community.

We hope our Executive Com-
mittee will reflect these opi-
nions next Monday night.

Applause for the
Executive Committee

Dear Editor,

I would like to commend the
Executive Committee on its re-
cent decision to “Free Mike
Gallagher.’’ However, the
nature of my statement is not
exactly what some have in
mind. The EC did the only thing
possible on account of the inept
manner in which Mr. Gallagher
was removed by the Publica-
tions Board.

What else could the EC do,
but override the decision of the
Pub Board? It doesn’t make
sense or seem really fair that
the Pub Board should drop a
bomb in Gallagher’s lap after
backing him on so many of his
previous bloopers, blunders,
and errors. It is the Pub Board
that is primarily responsible for
Gallagher’s lack of taste. They
have never done anything in the
nast when Gallagher: stuck his

foot in his mouth.

I was offended by that parody
issue. It may have been
humorous, but it is not my idea
(nor that of a great many
others) of how I want my school
represented. But that is a moot
point. The real issue at hand is
the dangerous precedent that
will arise by not putting
Gallagher in his place. A person
who is awarded the position of
editor of a school newspaper
should have some modicum of
integrity and good taste. It is
true that the Pub Board was
quite slow in trying to
ameliorate the situation. But
they tried. They were generous
in the past in backing
Gallagher’s past blunders, but
this was the straw that broke
the camel’s back.

bursed advertisement fees.
Gallagher pointed out that it
was the Pub Board’s decision to
reimburse the advertisers. Volk
said that the Pub Board had no
other recourse given the fact
that the advertisers didn’t know
in advance of the lampoon
issue.

Dave McLean _ ex-business
editor of the Phi, said, ‘‘I don’t
think that these issues warrant
his dismissal. We don’t want to
send a message to the com-
munity that we are opposed to
creativity. Let’s look at the im-
plications. The motion is sym-
bolic, long range.”

Peter Goss, this year’s
business manager, agreed with
McLean that the issue was sym-
bolic, but differed with him on
the subject that it didn’t war-
rant Gallagher’s dismissal.
Goss said ‘‘I think it’s an impor-
tant issue, whether the editor is
going to be responsible to the
Pub Board.”

Grant Leister Calyx business
manager, also questioned the
motion severity. In response to
accusations that he acted ir-
responsibly; Gallagher said
relatively little that he has not
already expressed. Gallagher
and Caylx editor Temp Webber
said that the students had sup-
ported Gallagher’s position at
the last Pub Board meeting.

They said the fact that
Gallagher’s tenure was still be-
ing discussed, after the motion
was withdrawn at the last
meeting, was indicative of the
Pub Board’s desire to circum-
vent the will of the student
body. Both Potter and Bird
disputed that contention claim-
ing that 125 people does not con-
stitute the will of the entire stu-
dent body.

Bird and Potter added that

just because the motion to
remove Gallagher as the editor
of the Ring-tum Phi had been
withdrawn at the last meeting
did not mean that the issue was
over.
An official Pub Board letter
appeared in the glass-encased
bulletin board next to the
library notifying the student
body of the time and place of
Monday’s Pub Board meeting.
The letter indicated that the
issue of Gallagher’s tenure had
not been concluded.

Speaking for the “missing
papers’”’ the investigating com-
mittee, Bird said that he could
not find any evidence that the
administration had _par-
ticipated in rounding up of left
over Phi’s, with the exception of
Bob Keefe’s response to the
complaints he received from
visitors to the campus. Keefe
approved Mike Cappeto’s
removal of undistributed copies
(50-70) in the Student Center.

Bird suggested that the copies
eventually were distributed to
the students, although not
through the normal procedure.
According to Bird, the circula-
tion staff of the Phi did not
carry out their respective
duties for various reasons.

Jay Hemby had to attend a
lecture being given by Dean

Rusk at VMI. Ned McDonald
had personal misgivings about
distributing the Rank-tam
Poon. Chris O’Conner saw some
copies in Evans Dining Hall,
normally part of his route, and
assumed that somebody had
already carried out his circula-
tion duties.

However Bird suggested that
‘the shock value brought extra
demand for the papers.’’ He
also said that it is very common
for fraternity members to take
25 or so copies back with them
to their house. Since Wendy’s
was advertising free coupons
this week, Bird said it’s likely
that people picked up extra
copies for the coupons.

Bird also said that Betty
Munger on Friday morning took
200 copies of the lampoon issue
over to the Bookstore and plac-
ed them next to her cash
register. According to Bird,
Munger said that the copies
went unusually fast.

Webber said that much of
Bird’s reasoning was no less
speculative than his theory that
someone gathered up 700 issues
of the paper.

After being informed of the
verdict both Gallagher and
Webber stormed out of the
meeting room.

Neither remained for the
discussion concerning next
year’s business manager of the
Phi. Owen reported that no ap-
plications for the position had
been received. Peter Goss said
that he would be willing to re-
main as business manager for
next year. The remaining
members of the board
unanimously approved Goss’s
reappointment to that post.

A Chapin Discography — Concert, May 11

(continued from page 3)
Chapin reveals that he never
had time to be with his son while
he was young and then finds,
when his son grows older, the
young man no longer has any
time to be with his father. The
second hit from this album, “I
Wanna Learn a Love Song,” is
about his giving guitar lessons
to a bored and_ love-lost
housewife.

Also emerging from this
album was ‘30,000 Pounds of
Bananas,’’ which was to
become a concert favorite. This
humorous country tune, which
also became a favorite on the
Dr. Dimento Show, provides the
audience with a good break and
release of emotion amidst the
melodrama of a Chapin con-
cert.

PORTRAIT GALLERY —
Elektra 7E-1041

The mood of ‘‘Portrait
Gallery”’ is a little lighter than
most of his other albums, but
this mood is shattered on the se-
cond to last song, ‘““Bummer,”’ a
ten-minute saga of a young man
from the ghetto, whose only
escape was to die.

The album’s light tone is set,
however, with songs like
‘“‘Dreams Go By’’ and ‘‘Tangled
Up Puppet,” a song in which he
addresses his daughter with a
message similar to the one con-
veyed to his son in “‘Cat’s in the
Cradle.”

live album captures the true
magic and magnificence of a
Chapin concert, and gives a
pretty good indication of what
to expect next Thursday.
Brothers Tom Chapin (guitar,
banjo, and vocals) and Steve
Chapin (piano, vocals, and pro-
ducer) rejoined Harry for this
tour, and the live versions of
almost all the songs are better
than the studio versions. One of
the most remarkable features
of this album, like the concerts,
is the backup vocals of bassit
John Wallace. Wallace has an
incredible eight-octave voice,
ranging from the angelic highs
of ‘‘Taxi’’ to the deep baritone
of ‘‘Mr. Tanner.” Another wor-
thy of notice on this album is a
ten-minute, joke-filled version
of ‘30,000 Pounds of Bananas.”

ON THE ROAD TO KINGDOM
COME — Elektra 7E-1082

Chapin followed his live
album with a rather weak
release, and I thought his
career might be on the
downslide after six fine albums.

“The Mayor of Can-
dor Lied,” a song about a young
man who falls in love with the
mayor’s daughter, only to find
that she is his half-sister, has
received a lot of FM airplay.

Pub Board suspends paper

Student Body Prints Ring-tum Phi

The Publications Board voted
to suspend publication of the
Ring-tum Phi at a Pub. Board
meeting Wednesday afternoon.

The Board was unanimous in
their sentiments, voting 6-0 to
end publication.

The vote was reportedly in
protest over the Executive
Committee’s action Monday
night which had the effect of
overturning the Pub. Board’s
decision to fire Gallagher as
editor of the Ring-tum Phi.

Ryland Owen, chairman of
the Publications Board, and
Robert Keefe, administration
advisor, had resigned from the

Board prior to the meeting in
protest of the EC’s action.
Temp Webber and Mike
Gallagher also were not present
for the vote.

A spokesman for the Publica-
tions Board said that publica-
tion of the student newspaper
would be suspended until an
understanding is reached bet-
ween the Pub. Board and the
EC concerning authority and
responsibility over the Ring-
tum Phi.

Publications Board members
feel that the EC’s decision
makes them responsible for the
content of the paper without

authority over the paper.

Gallagher is an editor the
Pub. Board felt it no longer
wants to take responsibility for,
the spokesman said. However,
the main issue is EC authority
over Publications Board deci-
sions.

Also discussed at the meeting
was a plan for direct student
funding for the newspaper. Stu-
dent funds are now channeled
through the Executive Commit-
tee.

The Pub. Board feels that the
Executive Committee should
not have jurisdiction over Pub.

EC reinstates Gallagher

by Randy Smith

The Executive Committee
voted to reinstate J. Michael
Gallagher as editor of the Ring-
tum Phi Monday night. The EC
vote has the effect of overturn-
ing last week’s Publications
Board decision to dismiss
Gallagher from his duties as the
student aewspaper’s editor.

The vote, 8-4, reflected the
two-thirds majority required of
the EC to finalize the act of
reversing the Pub. Board’s
dismissal attempt.

(The student body constitu-
tion prescribes that Washington
and Lee’s student government
must attain a two-thirds majori-
ty vote in two consecutive

meetings to overturn action
taken by the Publication Board.
The initial vote to overrule the
Pub. Board was taken last
Tuesday at a specially called
EC meeting.)

The Executive Committee’s
action brings to an end the three
weeks of controversy surroun-
ding Gallagher and the April 20
joke issue of the newspaper, the
Rank-tam Poon.

Three members of the
Publications Board read
prepared statements restating
their reasons for Gallagher’s
dismissal.

Ryland Owen, chairman of
the Pub. Board, said that it was
“not realistic’ for the EC to

Muckrakers accept

~WLUR challenge

WLUR. has challenged the
Ring-tum Phi to a softball game
to be held next Friday at 3 p.m.
The Ring-tum Phi
‘“‘Muckrakers” have officially
accepted the challenge ac-
cording to player-coach Mike
Gallagher.

‘We are going to beat the hell
out of that halfa radio station.
Those disk jockeys are just all
mouth,” said Gallagher.

WLUR coach Bob deMaria
called Gallagher a liar and said
that he doubted his team would
get much fair pre-game publici-
ty. ‘‘Thata Gallagher is a bigga
mouth. Alla he can do isa printa
smut and dirty words.”’
DeMaria had more to say, but it
got lost ina mouth full of pasta’

WLUR program director
Mark Mainwaring expressed
some fears as to whether his
team will be ready. “The Phi
looks tough, as it always does.
Our guys might have some pro-
blems hitting their slur ball.”

Mainwaring did say that he
expected ‘‘the Load’’ and
“‘Travae’’. to . give, the
Muckrakers some trouble. “If
the Phi doesn’t watch out, they
might wind up with tobacco
juice intheireyes.” +

Gallagher said the Phi has a
surprise in store for the “halfa
radio station”. He and top-
salaried superstar Pete Goss
have patched up their dif-
ferences, at least until the
series is over, according to
Gallagher. “Pete and I have
had our little differences in the
past, but we both agree that the
main goal is to make the
Muckrakers number one.”

DeMaria promised that no
matter who won, there would be
fun for all and refreshment for
the participants. “My wifea
makes a gooda pasta. We willa
drink plenty of beer and make
big whoopie.”’

The public is invited.

 

assume that the Pub. Board has
not supported Gallagher all
year. He said that “nine times
out of ten’’ the Publications
Board has sided with the con-
troversial editor over the
business manager in financial
disputes.

Owen also said _ that
Gallagher’s dismissal did not
constitute a threat to future
editors of the Ring-tum Phi.
‘Much like a Democratic con-
vention, we have chosen a can-
didate,’’ Owen explained.
‘‘What we have done
(Gallagher’s removal) is in the
best interest of the University,”
Owen added.

Chris Volk defined the rela-
tionship between a publisher
and an editor for the EC, to
justify the Pub. Board’s right to
fire an “irresponsible” editor.
He also disputed Gallagher’s
contention that the Rank-tam
Poon was a feature section of
the Ring-tum Phi.

‘“‘We are responsible for the
Rank-tam Poon,” Volk said. In

NUMBER 28

SAB Bash Sunday

Harry Chapin will appear in
concert tonight in the Warner
Center at 8 p.m. Tickets are
$4.00 in advance and $5.00 at the
door. Chapin has guaranteed at
least a two and one half hour
concert.

Security for the concert will
be tighter than what has been
true in the past according to
Tucker. “To help us comply
with the ABC regulations, one
uniformed policeman will be
stationed at each entrance to
the gym. There will be also two
gym personnel at each door.”’

Tucker said the SAB will try
to keep the gym completely dry,
including soft drinks. Tucker
does not to be responsible for
any students who violate ABC
violations. Also, by keeping the
gym dry, the SAB will save $300
in cleaning costs.

When asked about drugs,
Tucker said he nor the ABC of-
ficials have any jurisdiction
concerning drugs. He alluded
that smoke could be blown in
the face of an ABC official and
nothing would result.

Jackie Boyden, a twenty-two
year old law student from
Grand Rapids, Michigan, won
the 1978 Nathan Burks Moot
Court Competition April 28. The
annual competition matches
first-year law students of the
Washington and Lee Law
School in appellate advocacy
skills.

All first-year students par-
ticipate in the first round of
competition by preparing ap-
pellate briefs and oral
arguments. After first round
before Burks
Scholars and members of law
school moot court teams, twen-
ty four students compete in a se-
cond round before Burks
Scholars. Burks Scholars are
third-year law students who
assist in the teaching of Legal
Methods and Moot Court
classes to first-year students.
Eight semi-finalists are
selected from this group of
quarter-finalists to argue
before two faculty panels. This
year, the four finalists then
argued before members of the
Virginia Supreme Court.

The competition centered on
a criminal prosecution in the
fictional state of Rockbridge.
The defendant in the problem
case was charged with attemp-

Other activities planned for
the weekend inlude a bluegrass
festival Sunday, and movies in
the Cockpit during the entire
weekend. Freddy Goodhart and
the Second Hand Band will
highlight a Sunday afternoon
full of music, food and other ac-
tivities starting at 2 p.m. The
E.C. will provide 25 kegs of beer
and the University Food Ser-
vices is providing 2500 hot dogs
for the W&L community. The
cookout will begin at 3 p.m.
Another band, Blueridge, has
been contacted and may play
Sunday also.

The SAB will show an in-
teresting film in the Cockpit this
weekend. The Devil in Miss
Jones will be shown Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday nights at
10 and 12 p.m. The film is the
SAB’s annual skin flick, ac-
cording to Tucker. Tucker em-
phasized that this is a private
showing for the Washington and
Lee community. He added that
he believes the SAB has an un-
cut version of the controversial
film. The cost of admission will
be one dollar.

ted importation of a controlled
substance, “‘singatrille,” and
carrying a deadly weapon.
Competitors argued the merits
of an impossibility defense as
the actual substance found was
analysed as cornstarch. An
entrapment defense with the
dilemma of a defendant who
refused to admit he committed
a crime was attempted by the
budding advocates. Illegal
search and seizure debates and
an argument against a flare
pistol posing as a deadly
weapon were relied upon as
well. Boyden described the pro-

’ blem as “‘a real bitch.”’

Participants are judged both
on the quality of written briefs
and oral advocacy. The 1978
Best Brief Award was earned
by James Osick who ranked
sixth in the overall competition.
Finalists included Ken Lyons,
second place, and.Jerrauld
Jones and Dan Westbrook who
tied for third place.

Boyden, the first woman to
take first-place honors in the a!
annual W&L Law School event,
is known for her active role on
the Executive Committee this
year as First Year Law
Representative. She also was
elected recently to the office of
Student Bar Association Vice-
President for 1978-79.

Pub Board decision overturned\sgaq

(continued from page 1)

Gallagher ‘‘ignored’’ his
business manager and the
Publication Board, Volk said.
He concluded his statement by
urging the EC not to overturn
the Pub. Board decision to
remove Gallagher.

An EC vote to overturn the
Pub. Board’s dismissal action
would ‘“‘destroy the purpose of
the Publications Board,’’ cau-
tioned Grant Leister. He also
discussed the relationship bet-
ween the editor and the
business manager this year. “‘It
was (Gallagher’s) responsibili-
ty to inform the business
manager as to the nature of a
radically different issue,’’ he
said.

‘“‘We had to send a message to
future editors that they will be
held accountable,’’ explained
Jeff Bird. He added that in his
estimation the Pub. Board’s ac-
tion would not stifle the
creativity of future editors.

“T stated my case last week
and have nothing more to add,”’
was all Gallagher said in his
defense.

Futher discussion before the
EC vote centered on the prece-
dent of the Executive Commit-
tee overturning a decision of the
Publication Board.

Parker Potter, editor of Ariel,
said that last week’s EC vote to
overturn the Pub. Board’s ac-

395 applicants accept

More than 55 percent of the
applicants offered admission by
Washington and Lee University
for next September have ac-
cepted that offer, the most
favorable confirmation rate in a
dozen years, university admis-
sions officials reported this
week.

As of this week, 396 prospec-
tive freshmen had indicated
their intention to enroll at W&L
next fall. The university seeks
an entering class of 350 to 360
students each year. Based on
past experience’ admissions of-
ficials say, as many as 20 to 25
will decide over the summer not
to attend W&L after all.

W&L processed a total of 972
completed applications this
year. ‘‘Completed applica-
tions” are those for which all

tion constituted ‘“‘a far more
dangerous precedent” than the
Pub. Board’s decision to
remove Gallagher from the
editorship.

“We are the ones who have
the cross to bear as the
publishers of the Ring-tum Phi;
we're the ones stuck with the
decision,’’ he said.

EC president Jim Underhill
questioned Potter’s reasoning.
“It is up to the Committee to
decide the danger of the prece-
dent we set,” he said.

Tom Healy, EC law school
representative, said that the
EC’s decision in the Gallagher
firing ‘‘will long’ be
remembered; this decision is
probably the biggest made by
any student organization”’ in a
long time.

“T can’t look at the Pub.
Board as a completely im-
partial judge in this matter,”’
Healy said. He faulted both
Gallagher and the Publication
Board for an apparent “‘break-
down of communication.”

“We are the press in this in-
stance and we are dealing with
a primarily internal press mat-
ter,” said Potter.

Healy expressed the concern
that students ‘‘down the road’”’
in three or four years would in-
terpret the Gallagher firing as
“an editor getting canned for

transcripts, recommendations
and other required materials
were received. That figure was
down from last year’s 1,320. Dr.
John said the dropoff occurred,
as admissions officials had an-
ticipated, almost entirely
among potential applicants who
recognized they were clearly
unqualified or who had no
strong desire to attend W&L
from the beginning.

The 55 percent confirmation
figure is based on a projection
of 375 freshmen actually enroll-
ing.

In recent years, the confirma-
tion figure has typically been 46
to 48 percent - meaning that
slightly fewer than half the ap-
plicants W&L accepted actual-
ly enrolled.

stirring up controversy.”

‘“‘We’re not blasting him for
investigative reporting or his
liberal attitude,’ Potter said.
“Responsibility up and down
the line, that’s what we’re say-
ing.”’

The Executive Committee
was able to attain a two-thirds
majority to override the
Publications Board decision,
even though two members
changed their votes from last

week. Voting to retain
Gallagher as editor were: Hea-
ly, Underhill, Jackie Boyden,
Steve Abraham, Andy
Bodenstab, Doug Perkins, Jack
Bovay, and Chris Gammon.
Siding with the Publications
Board were: Mike Missal, Jim
Davis, George Griffin, and Neil
Pentifallo.

Underhill and Missal had
voted differently in last Tues-
day’s initial vote.

“I don’t see why (the EC)
should have been in this mess in
the first place,’ explained
Missal. He said that he con-
sidered the Pub. Board’s action
‘‘a personnel change.”’

Underhill said he was un-
convinced by the Pub. Board’s
precedent argument. ‘‘No one’s
ever going to let an editor run
rampant— although
Gallaghker’s come close to doing
it,” he said.

Campus reform
group to organize

A new campus organization is
forming. The as yet unnamed
organization will devote its time
and energy to representing stu-
dent opinion and working
towards the guarantee of
students’ rights, according to
one of the coordinators Dick
Moss.

An organizational meeting ‘is
planned for Tuesday night at 8
p.m. in Room 114 of the student
center. All students interested
in campus politics and in having
their opinions heard should at-
tend this meeting.

In talking about the organiza-

admission to W&L

The objective characteristics
of the September 1978 entering
class - class rank in secondary
school and College Board scores
~ are virtually identical among
the students who have confirm-
ed their intention to attend
W&L as they were among last
fall’s freshman class, the
university said.

University officials attribute
the upswing this year in the con-
firmation rate to substantially
increased recruiting and follow-
up communication of admis-
sions officials, together with the
addition of an essay which all
applicants were required to
submit.

The 400-to-600-word essay had
the effect of discouraging ap-
plications from students whose
interest in attending W&L was

marginal and applications from
students who recognized they
had little chance of being ac-
cepted, the university’s admis-
sions officials said.

“The essay had the effect we
had desired of resulting in a
considerable measure of self-
screening among the potential
applicant pool,” Dr. Lewis G.
John, admissions director and
dean of students, said.

At a recent general meeting,
the W&L faculty formally
reiterated the university's com-
mitment to maintaining a stu-
dent body of superior academic
excellence.

The university restricted of-
fers of admission again this
year to students of academic
quality comparable to the quali-
ty of recent entering classes.

Grant Received by University

The Andrew W. Mellon Foun-
dation has given Washington
and Lee University a $208,000,
four-year grant to support a
number of faculty professional-
development programs, design-
ed to increase the effectiveness
of faculty members as
teacherscholars.

The Mellon grant will support
those activities while the
university raises permanent
funds to continue them through
its own endowment income.

Part of the Mellon grant will
permit Washington and Lee to
bring teachers from other col-
leges and universities and
leaders from business, industry

and government to W&L as
visiting professors either for
one academic term or for a full
academic year.

The grant will also establish a
new program under which en-
tire academic departments at
W&L will visit counterpart
departments at other colleges
when W&L is not in session.
The visitation program will per-
mit critical self-evaluation and
the exchange of professional
ideas and information with
teaching colleagues elsewhere.

The Mellon grant will also
provide funds to permit
teachers, especially younger
faculty members, to visit and
consult individually with col-

leagues elsewhere on their
teaching and their own personal
research. The grant will also
provide supplements on a selec-
tive basis to teachers on leave
in support of particularly pro-
mising or noteworthy research
projects, and will also provide
additional support for
Washington and Lee’s John M.
Glenn summer research and
study program.

The Glenn fund consists of a
$120,000 endowment established
in 1953 by the late Mr. Glenn, an
1879 W&L alumnus who was an
officer of the Russell Sage
Foundation. Each year, approx-
imately 10 to 12 W&L teachers
receive grants from the income

from the Glenn endowment to
help them carry out summer
research and professional self-
development.

tion, Moss said it was time for
the unrepresented segment of
the Washington and Lee student
body to have its needs
represented. Moss said the
coordinators decided an
organization such as this was
needed after all the corruption
that existed in student govern-
ment was uncovered. Moss said
the organization would work to
keep student leaders and
representatives responsible. He
also said the organization would
appeal to the faculty and ad-
ministration to be aware of
students’ rights. ‘‘We as of now,
have no input or control over
how the faculty does its job.
Students need an outlet to com-
plain regarding representative
and faculty performance. Our
organization plans to be that
outlet, for all students.

 

Griffin
Receives

Award

George Francis Griffin IV
was given the Gilliam Award at
the Senior Banquet Tuesday
night.

The Gilliam Award is given
by the undergraduates to the
senior who has done the most
for Washington and Lee. The
Gilliam Award was created in
1963 in honor of Dean Frank J.
Gilliam, who retired in 1963,
after many years as W&L’s
Dean of Admissions. The award
is given solely on the basis of
service, rather than in con-
sideration of need.

Griffin has served as vice-
president of the student body
this year, and has been a dor-
mitory counselor for two years.

He is also one of the founding
members of the recently reac-
tivated Kappa Alpha social

At Henry St. Playhouse

Little Mary Sunshine previewed

. by John Jacobsen

Many members of the
Washington and Lee communi-
ty have long realized the need
for evening activities during the
summer months. In response to
this need the Troubadour
Theatre has formed a profes-
sional guild called the Henry
Street Playhouse and Stock
Company which will open its
season on May 21 with Rick
Besoyan’s,Little Mary Sun-
shine, Set in the Colorado
Rockies at the turn of the cen-
tury, this melodramtic musical
is the tale of the early attempts
to U.S. Forest Rangers to sub-
due the wilderness and the local
Indians. It’s style is that of the
operetta-mode that was so
popular in the nineteenth cen-
tury, and the show, as well as
the atmosphere of the
Playhouse in general, recalls a
period compatible with the style
of restored Lexington. As a lov-
ing lampoon of old-time operet-
tas, Little Mary Sunshine has
become something of an
American favorite.

The playhouse is made up of
25 members selected from both
the University and the com-
munity, and is being guided by
Dr. Albert Gordon and Tom
Ziegler. Both are members of

“Turning Point” is a film for athletes |

by John Ellis
“Turning Point”

This is a film about one of the
world’s greatest athletes, Mikal
Baryshnikov, a ballet star who
defected from Russia to join the
American Ballet Company of
New York. Not that it is a
documentary about M.B., but
instead a soap opera style
‘‘well-made’’ film (Hollywood
guaze-and-twinkle time) about
M.B.’s ballet company. There is
no point letting the mish-mash
of a plot distract from the real
(and only) source of pleasure
here — it is the dance as virile,
poetic, and ‘angelic; the im-
possible’ is made graceful.

the Washington and Lee
Theatre, and can be sighted for
their superb production ofThe
Beau Stratagem last fall. Two
Lexingtonians have the leads in
the production, even though the
cast is mostly composed of
students currently involved in
the Total Theatre Program.
David Sorrells plays Captain
Big Jim Warrington, and Penni
Westbrook is Little Mary
herself. Students in the cast in-
clude Bill Thistlewaite as Chief
Brown Bear, Barry Godin as
Fleet Foot, Hunt Brown as
Yellow Feather, and Jim
Weatherstone as General Oscar
Fairfax. And of course Jay
Blumberg plays another sup-
porting role as Hank.

Lexington, during the sum-
mer months, has many tourists
who, for some unclear reason,
flock together during the day,
but who have little to see at
night. The Henry Street
Playhouse and Stock Company
hopes to offer a solution to this
typically Lexington problem by
providing light hearted family
shows whose intermissions will
be filled with musical entertain-
ment, stand-up comedians, and
drinks on their fetiv patio. All in
all, it seems to be a general goal
to provide a well balanced even-

ing of Lexington laughs.

Baryshnikov literally hovers
over the film by the love of his
discipline. Anyone remotely in-
terested in how the body can ex-
cell in strength and beauty of
motion must see the film. Im-
agine Julius Ewing’s mid-air
control, O. J. Simpson’s speed
and agility, and George
Foster’s strength. The
equivalents of these skills and a
poetic grace are M.B.’s gifts.
He is the greatest dancer, hence
athlete, of our:time.

Oh, and by the way, the film is
very careful to point out that he

is heterosexual. I repeat:' He,

likes girls (Lest anyone feel this
review is giving W&L the
wrong image. )

Little Mary Sunshine runs
from May 17-21, June 14-18,
21-25, at 8 p.m. with matinees on
June 17 and 24 at 2. For more in-
formation, call the Playhouse at

ELP Show To Air

Beginning at noon this Satur-
day, May 13, WLUR-FM will
feature six continuous hours of

_the music of British supergroup

Emerson Lake & Palmer. Next
week, the “Saturday Afternoon
Special’ (a weekly feature on
WLUR) will focus on the
Beatles.

Keith Emerson was a pioneer
in the development and per-
formance of electronic music,
and worked closely with Bob
Moog in the creation of the
Moog synthesizer. He left The
Nice in 1970 to join up with Greg

Lake (ex-King Crimson) on
guitar and vocals, and Carl
Palmer (ex-Atomic Rooster) on
percussion. ELP rose to inter-
national reknown in the music
field with the release of their
very first album, simply titled
Emerson, Lake, and Palmer.
They’ve released eight LP’s
since then, culminating with
their latest efforts, the highly-
orchestrated Works, Volume 1
and Volume 2.

WLUR may be found at 91.5

! Genesis has finally reached

the point attained by. every '

¢ial success after years of hard °

Work. Where do they go from
here? With the release of this
album, Messrs. Collins, Banks,
and Rutherford have provided
an answer -nowhere. After serv-
ing as one of the few truly
creative sources in rock for ten
years and nearly a dozen
albums, Genesis has elected to

take its money and run.

No mistake about it - the rich,

swirling texture of the band’s
music is still there. Without any

good melodies, though, it just |

doesn’t go anywhere. Gone are
the. extended, detailed  in-

made its well-deserved reputa-

fascinating, if somewhat
bizarre; lyrics. Instead, we
have eleven short songs featur-

It’s useless to point out at this

main cause of Genesis’ slow and

Track Team Ends

Season 5-2

by Bill Sherwin

This past Friday, the track
generals lost their final meet of
the season to Bridgewater,
97-48. The overall record posted
is 5-2, which Coach Norris
Aldridge considered to be
satisfactory. ‘‘We had a very
good year, especially consider-
ing the young age of most of the
team. This year we lose only
five seniors.”

High points of the season in-
cluded victories in the 200 and
100 meter sprints, Captain Jack
Norberg winning both. Co-Capt.
Norelle Scott set a record in the
400 meter hurdles, Rich Byrd
won the 1500 meter race, runn-
ing the equivalent of an 4:17
mile. Richard Weeks set a
record in the 5000 meter run,
and Karl Cheatham set a school
record in the triple jump.

Coach Aldridge praised the
seniors for a job well done this
past season. Graduating will be
4% miler Bill Welch, 3-miler Al
Weeks, miler Kevin Grimm,
sprinter John Morris, and shot
putter Tony Ciucci. Jeff Slat-

coff, who throws the javelin,
will also be leaving after this
Spring.

Aldridge is optimistic for the
team next year. ‘“‘We have a full
440 and mile relay team retur-
ing. We are strong in other
events as well. If we can stay
free of injuries next year, we
should have an_ excellent
team.”

The winners in the recent
meet against Bridgewater were
the mile relay team which ran
its fastest time of the year, Rich
Byrd in the mile, and Jack
Norberg in the 220. ‘‘I was pro-
ud of the team. They are very
young and hung in there,”’ said
Aldridge.

Aldridge did not claim there
were any especially high spots
in the year, instead saying that
youth and talent put a shine on
most of the season. “Lynchburg
was probably our best meet, but
the whole team did really well
all season. I am looking forward
to a very successful season next
year.”

Hopkins and Maryland
Where Are You?

by Ray McNulty

The W&L lacrosse team
defeated Rutgers last Saturday
by a score of 11-9 and is present-
ly ranked seventh in the nation.
Depending on the outcome of
this weekend’s games, W&L
will probably make the NCAA
University Division tournament
for the seventh consecutive
year and will probably play
either Johns Hopkins,
Maryland or Navy.

A question being asked
around the W&L campus is
‘‘Why haven’t we played any of
these teams during the regular
season?”

When Maryland and Navy did
not appear on the W&L lacrosse
schedule, several rumors began
circulating around campus. The
rumor that was the most
popular said that Maryland and
Navy would not play us because
the W&L fans were too obnox-
ious. Although W&L fans have
been known to be a bit rowdy at
times, this was not the reason
W&L did not play Maryland or
Navy this season.

W&L coach Jack Emmer
said that Navy refused to play
W&L because of personal
reasons of Navy coach Dick
Szlasa. Szlasa was the lacrosse
coach at W&L before the ar-
rival of Emmer in 1973. Emmer
said that Szlasa still has strong
sentiments for W&L and does

not want to play against us.
In the situation with
Maryland, Emmer said that the

reason they were not on the
W&L schedule was because of a
lack of communication on the
part of Maryland. Emmer said
that a game between W&L and
Maryland was being planned
for the last weekend in April. He
said that he then heard that
Maryland had already agreed
to play Johns Hopkins on that
weekend. In an attempt to
reschedule the game, Emmer
wrote a letter to Maryland say-
ing that W&L was still in-
terested in playing Maryland.
Emmer said that it took
Maryland nine months to
acknowledge ‘the letter. By
then, Emmer had most of the
W&L schedule arranged. He
said that Maryland wanted to
play us on May 13, but W&L had
already agreed to play Hofstra
on that date. Maryland would
not agree to play on another
date, therefore, W&L did not
play Maryland this year.

W&L has not played John
Hopkins in a regular season
game since 1962, Hopkins winn-
ing 15-4. W&L and Johns
Hopkins have met in_post-
season tournaments three times
with Hopkins winning two out of
the three contests; W&L won
the most recent game in 1975.

Play Hofstra On Sat.

by Sandy Bishop

Led by Charlie Brown’s
sparkling play in and out of the
goal, W&L’s stick team gained
an 11-9 do-or-die victory over
Rutgers University Saturday on
Wilson Field.

The Generals, ranked No. 7 in
this week’s USILA poll, knew
that a loss to the Scarlet
Knights would severely cripple
their chances of gaining a post-
season playoff bid for the
seventh consecutive year.

Led by Brown, who had 14

saves, set up a goal by Johnny
Black, and took a shot himself,
W&L played Rutgers even
before building a_ three-goal
fourth quarter lead which car-
ried the Generals to their ninth
win.
W&L spotted the Scarlet
Knights a 2-0 lead before Jay
Sindler dodged his man, slipped
to one knee, and rammed home
his shot with 6:32 left in the
opening quarter. Jeff Fritz, who
had four goals in one of his
finest efforts of the season,
made it 2-2 three minutes later
— the first of six tie scores.

the team, the season ends.

a fine performance, began turn-
ing every shot away, and at
halftime Rutgers held a narrow
4-3 advantage.

But the Knights committed a
foul just before the half ended,
and the Generals started the
third quarter with a man ad-
vantage. Goals by Sandy
McDonald and Fritz put W&L
in the lead, and then the action
got really hot. ‘“Those two goals
were a big lift for us,”’ said
Coach Emmer. “That got us
over the top.’

But Rutgers was not about to
quit. Just over a minute had
elapsed before Mark Tyree
stole a W&L clearing pass and
tied the contest at five as he
fired into an open net. Both
teams toughened up on defense,
and after three periods the
score stood at 7 to 7. Then
Brown took over.

In the first minute of quarter
No. 4, Brown charged upfield on
a solo clear, found Black open to
the right of the Rutgers net, and
fed him for the tie-breaking
goal. Three minutes later,
Brown made another run, this
one ending in a shot on goal.

*

“Brown was confident out there

Generals win big over Rutgers

Saturday,” Emmer said. “It
was as good a game as he has
played all year.”’

Brown’s play had_ the
Generals fired up and taking
control of the situation. Sindler
dodged his man to score, and
then fed Fritz to make it 10-7
with 5:58 to go. Will Brown
tallied for Rutgers a minute
later, but his point-blank at-
tempt with 1:25 left was stopped
by the Generals’ Brown, and
W&L held on to win.

Coach Emmer cited the per-
formance of Mark Derbyshire,
Black, Fritz and the entire
defense as very important in
Saturday’s win.

Now the Generals face 11-
ranked Hofstra at Mt.
Washington in Baltimore Satur-
day. Hofstra, which had a rocky
early season, has turned things
around and won seven of its last
eight games. Said Emmer,
“They are as good as any
Hofstra team that has beaten us
in the last three years.’’ If the
Generals win Saturday, they
could possibly earn a trip to
next Wednesday’s NCAA
quarterfinal games.

Baseball season ends;
Statistics given

by Warren Crowdus

Commenting on his team’s
5-16 record this spring, baseball
coach Joseph Lyles unsurpris-
ingly termed the season a
“disappointment.”’ But he also
felt that a number of un-
foreseeable circumstances
combined to make the team’s
record worse than it should
have been. He also thought that
the young General team will be
considerably stronger next
season after getting a valuable
year of experience.

The main factor mitigating
the success of this year’s team
was bad weather early in the
season, forcing the postpone-
ment of several home games
against non-ODAC opponents.

Thus, the young and inex-
perienced team was obliged to
start the season on the road
against conference opposition,
including Lynchburg, a peren-
nial baseball powerhouse. Fur-
thermore, all of the cancelled
contests had to be made up in
the second half of the season,
overworking the undermanned
pitching staff. Chip Childs, the
“‘ace’’ of the staff, frequently
worked with only two days rest.

Another damaging factor was
one that haunts many teams:
the injury. Pitcher By Steele
was hurt early in the season,
and was only able to work nine-
teen innings as a result. The
bulk of the pitching burden had
to be borne by only three men.

The season was not without
it’s bright moments, however.
Coach Lyles pointed to two
games in particular, one a loss,
the other a win. He felt that a 6-4
loss at the hands of 15th ranked
Citadel was a high point. The
Generals, behind the strong pit-
ching of Childs, led for most of
the contest, only to be overcome
by a late rally. Lyles was so im-
pressed with the performance
of Childs that he said, ‘“The way
Childs threw, it was a shame
that the entire student body was
not there to see him.’’ The other
highlight was the come from
behind 7-6 win over ODAC
champion Bridgewater.

Tennis Generals 3-0

in Division III

by Mike Farrand

The tennis Generals raised
their record against Division III
schools to 3-0 on Saturday with a
7-2 victory over the Randolph-
Macon Yellowjackets. The
away match at Roanoke
scheduled for Thursday was
rained out. Their overall record
now stands at 9-11.

Ben Johns, Stewart Jackson,
Cody Davis, Doug Gaker, and
David Constine all won their
matches against Randolph-
Macon. Pat Norris played in the
sixth position and also won his
match. In doubles Coach Dennis
Bussard let some junior varsity
players play and from there
came the losses.

Tuesday and Wednesday the
Generals played ninth-ranked
Division III team Salisbury
State and were to go to An-
napolis to battle the tough
Naval Academy Midshipmen.
Press time came before these
scores could be reported. On
Saturday, May 13th, W&L hosts
Emory & Henry at one o’clock.

These last matches are in
preparation for the national
tournament that will be held in
Delaware, Ohio at the Ohio
Wesleyan College on May 17-20.
The Generals will attempt to
better their second place finish
of last year and are seeded first
for the tournament.

Golfers beat Roanoke
still waiting for playoff berth

Led by Jerry Maatman’s
meet low 74, the Washington
and Lee golfers beat Roanoke
392 to 397. Other low scores for
the Generals include Millard
Radford’s 78, Terry Shadrick’s
79, Dave Leunig’s 80 and Andy
Fitzgerald’s 81. The match was
held at the Lexington Country
Club, which has a par 71 course.

Coach Buck Leslie said that
Roanoke, which is a strong Di
vision II team, played a very
good match. John Newton led

the Maroons with a 75. Roanoke
will play postseason golf in the
Division II NCAA Tournament.

The Generals are still waiting
for a postseason playoff birth in
the Division III Tournament.
Undefeated in regular season
play, The Generals are led in
scoring by Jerry Maatman who
will partici pate as an in-
dividual in the Natiomals in
Wooster, Ohio, on May 23. Last
year the team placed 7th out of
20 in the NCAA tournament.

in four runs to pace the W&L at-
tack in that encounter.

Looking over some individual
performances, Lyles felt that
the iron-man performance of
Childs, who worked 68 innings,
and the cleanup hitting of Bob
Szezecinski (.373, 1I5RBIs) were
the best. He was also pleased
with Ted Hissey, who played a
solid third base after three
years of shortstop, Dan
Kingman, who displayed so
much poise and leadership that
he has been named co-captain
of next year’s squad, and Chuck
D’Auria, who hit .283 and
“ought to be able to hit .300 with
his speed.”

Unfortunately, a lack of of-
fense from the traditional
power positions, the outfield
and first base, combined with a
lack of pitching depth and the
effects of the bad weather to
prevent the Generals from win-
ning as many as ten games, in
the opinion of Lyles.

Looking ahead to next season,
Coach Lyles foresses a substan-
tial improvement in W&L’s for-
tunes. This year’s edition was
very inexperienced (13 out of 18
were underclassmen), and will

improve with a year of ex-
perience. Furthermore, a total
of fourteen high school baseball
players have been recruited.
Seven of the fourteen are pit-
chers’ and one of the infielders
was an All-American. ‘That
should give us a much, much
better ball club.” Finally, Lyles
intends to begin work im-
mediately next fall. He en-
courages all athletes not par-
ticipating in a fall or winter

Lacrosse

Schedule

(continued from page 4)

Although both teams are con-
sidered ‘‘lacrosse powers,”
W&L has been unable to
schedule a regular season game
with Hopkins. Coach Emmer
said that there is no definite
reason why Hopkins will not
play W&L, but he feels that
recruiting might have
something to do with it. Emmer
said that W&L and Johns
Hopkins recruit the same type
of student-athlete and by not
playing W&L, Hopkins cuts
down on W&L’s exposure in the
Baltimore area.

When asked if he thought that
W&L might play any of these
three teams in the future, Em-
mer said that he is willing to
play any of them and it is up to
the other schools. Although Em-
mer would like to play these
teams, he said that he feels
W&L can still make the NCAA
tournament without these
teams by working hard and
playing good lacrosse.

So W&L fans, it is not your
fault that Maryland, Navy and
Hopkins didn’t play us this
year. Coach Emmer and the
W&L lacrosse team appreciate
your loyal support and hope you
continue to come out and cheer
for the team. Remember, W&L
plays Hofstra this Saturday.
See you in Baltimore!

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Voice Your Opinion

Once again the administration and faculty have
successfully humbled and shackled a segment of the
student body. The SAB has allowed itself to be kicked
out of DuPont Auditorium, and in so doing, subsub-
jected the student body to low quality showings of top
quality films. The new student “theatres” have rang-
ed from uncomfortable seating in Room 114 of the Stu-
dent Center, to echo-filled Evans Dining Hall.

Fine arts professor Al Gordon has a legitimate
gripe concerning a beer can-filled auditorium on Mon-
day morning but his wrath should not be directed
towards the student body. Buildings and Grounds per-
sonnel are paid to keep this campus and buildings
clean, not the students. Professor Gordon should
realize that DuPont Auditorium is not the only movie
theatre to have a deposit of cans and trash after a
night’s showing of films.

The buildings of Washington and Lee are for the use
of the students. Every other classroom on the
undergraduate campus stays unlocked and available
to students throughout the night. Since Gordon calls
the auditorium a classroom, it should stay open also.
Gordon should not have the authority to forbid
students from using the facilities that are made
available to them by payment of their tuition. Gordon
has acted in direct conflict with the philosophies of his
job- to serve the needs of the students.

Although the SAB initially protested to Gordon,
they now seem to be content with the present situa-
tion. Bill Tucker has asked the E.C. not to intervene
further, for reasons known only to Tucker. Since the
SAB refuses to go over Gordon’s head, the students
now must take matters into their own hands.
Students, do not be afraid to stop Gordon on campus
and give him your opinion on his action. Don’t be
afraid to call him at his office, or even at home, if you
really feel like it. If this doesn’t work, call Dean John
and then President Huntley. Call until something gets
done. If you are worried about possible repercussions
against you, don’t give your name. Students have a
right to the use of this building. We must retain this
right.

Preview For Next Year

Next year’s E.C. has already displayed the in-
telligence it will use next year to make important
decisions. The members obviously put much thought
into the selection of Doug Jackson.and Hank Hall as
co-chairmen of the SAB over Steve-Mangan. Jackson
took a leave of absence from school after being ap-

pointed SAB co-chairman last year. He therefore is _

not aware of the new stipulations placed upon com-
mittees and the increased responsibilities demanded
from their chairman. Jackson has not been in touch
with this year’s student body and it is questionable as
to whether he is too far removed from next year’s stu-
dent body tofairlyrepresentthem..

It may be recalled that Hall was responsible for the
February Grain Party fiasco when an estimated 200
people were admitted free of charge. Bottles of grain

also were stolen.
The E.C. chose these two men and passed over

perhaps the most qualified applicant. Steve Mangan,
through increased publicity and efficient handling of
funds, has turned the film committee into a selfsup-
porting subcommittee of the SAB, and did this during
a year of controversy and turmoil for the SAB. One
can do nothing but speculate as to what heights the
SAB would have reached under Mangan’s guidance.
Good job, fellas.

Student Body Betrayed

The Publications Board is betraying the stu-

dent body for which it was established to serve.

The job of the Pub Board is to ensure the
publishing of the Ring-tum Phi and the Calyx.
The vote the Board took yesterday shows its
main concern is who ultimately controls campus
publications, the student body. or the Publica-

tions Board.

The present members of the Publications
Board are acting as if they own the Ring-tum
Phi. The student body owns the Ring-tum Phi. As
long as the Ring-tum Phi is a guaranteed product
intended for the student body, the student body
deserves to receive one whenever possible.
Three more issues of the Ring-tum Phi were
planned for this year. In light of this knowledge,
the action the Publications Board took was ir-

responsible and purely selfish.

The Executive Committee has been charged
with oppression of the press. The Pub Board’s
action is of the press. The real oppressor here is
the Pub Board. The Pub Board wanted to dismiss

an editor for printing something they did not like.

The Pub Board is the body that wants to suspend

publication of the Ring-tum Phi. In both cases,

the E.C. acted to ensure that the rights and

wishes of the student body were upheld. The E.C.

retained the editor. The E.C. has guaranteed the

student body a newspaper.

According to the Student Body constitution, the
E.C. has appellate jurisdiction over decisions of
the Publications Board. This power is not one of
censorship. This power is rather to guarantee
that the Pub Board will not put into effect any
decision that would be detrimental to the student
body’s interests. Never has the E.C. reviewed
the pages of the Ring-tum Phi before printing.
Never has the E.C. used prior restraint. Now, the
very board which is supposed to publish the
Ring-tum Phi has attempted to restrain it.

The vote of the Publications Board indicates
the Board is unwilling to abide by and accept the
Student Body Constitution. Every Washington
and Lee student must uphold the Constitution.
The members of the Publications Board have
chosen not to. In any community, if an individual
or group of individuals refuses to live according
to the laws intended to protect the community,
the community expels them. Perhaps this is the
action that should be taken against the members
of the Publications Board.

Because a decision of the Publications Board
has been overturned by the judicial branch of the
student government, the Publications Board has
refused to publish the student newspaper. The
Pub Board is acting like the child who ran home
with his ball after he lost the game. j.m.g.

Boyden Comments |

on Controversy

To The Student Body:

The Executive Committee
voted to overrule the decision
by the Student Publications
Board to dismiss J, , Michael:
Gallagher as editor of the Ring-
tum Phi on Tuesday, May 2, and,
again on Monday, May 8. In the
aftermath of controversy sur-

‘rounding the Gallagher. inci-
dent, I would like to set forth my

statements as to the relevant
issues presented, and make,

| clear my position as to those
_ issues, ’ 3

, My decision to vote to over- :
_ rule the Pub. Board’s dismissal

:

_is ‘neither ‘an expression of
‘ agreement with. nor: condoning
of, Mr,. Gallagher’s, conduct

regarding the issuancé of the
Rank-Tam Poon. My vote to
overrule reflected my ‘opinion
that a dismissal was not war-
ranted in light of the informa-
tion presented: to the EC.
However, it is my feeling that
the issues raised during the
dismissal hearing are vitally
important, and demand further

“ consideration and discussion.

As with the extension of any

  
   
     
   
       

right or privilege, ‘‘freedom of
the press” is necessarily ac-
companied by certain respon-
sibilities. When a right is well
protected and jealously guard-
ed as press freedom, those who
claim its privileges have an
even greater responsibility to
exercise sound judgment and
well reasoned policy commen-
surate with those highly valued
privileges. The editor of a
school paper reaches a wide
and essentially captive au-
dience. The ramifications of
such control over the reader-
ship and over the news-
gathering and _ news-
disseminating activities of the
university community further
underscores the responsibile
position of the newspaper and
those who shape its policies.

The editor of the school paper

_ is not an elected official. The

student body does not exercise
its will through his appoint-
ment. Therefore as a decision
maker, the editor must

be allowed to be said that the
editor of W&L’s newspaper can
simply print whatever he so
desires. If that is the prevailing
attitude, it blindly disregards
the rigorous demands of ac-
countability, good judgment,
and integrity which an_in-
dividual entrusted with public
responsibility must
wholeheartedly accept. Such
acceptance of responsibility
demands careful weighing of
the consequences of one’s ac-
tions, regard for the best in-
terests of the community,
respect for journalistic integri-
ty, and perhaps most im-
portantly the realization that an
executive decisional follows an
established procedural process
designed to protect against
abuses inherent in solitary
power. Such a decision is far
more than an_ impulsive,
headstrong leap in whatever
direction an editor pleases. To
allow a single individual to
justify unbridled, unprincipled
actions by broadly asserting
“freedom of the press”, is to
provide wholesale license to ir-
responsiblity, and to abandon
the demands for accountability,
responsibility, and ethical con- .
duct which a student body must
rightfully demand of its
leaders. nee

Letters to Editor

To the editor:

Here is a letter to mom that
appeared in the Duke Chronical
years ago, with a few changes;

Dear Mom,

Very soon the undersigned
will once again be in your
midst, debauched, demoraliz-
ed, deflated, and delirious,
ready to take his place once
again as a human being with
freedom and justice for all,
engaged in life, liberty, and the
somewhat related pursuit of
happiness.

In your joyous preparation to
welcome him, you must make
allowances for the crude en-
vironment that has been his
home. He may be somewhat
grit, suffering from advanced
stages of intermuralitis, exam
cramming slump, and sand-
bags under the eyes, as well as
lacrosse fever and_ tubing
bruises, and must be handled
with care.

Show no alarm if he prefers to
squat rather than sit on a chair,
pads around the house in thong
sandals and a towel, takes
showers in the raw in the front
‘yard, slyly offers to sell dope to
the neighbors (for a profit of
course), craves cold drinks,
leaves plates and glasses in his
room until they mold, picks
suspiciously at his food as if you
were trying to poison him, and
gripes because the butter is
hard instead of soft and runny.

Be tolerant when he tries to
buy everything with his meal
card, accuses relatives of steal-
ing his Playboy pin-ups, and
refuses to enter a stranger’s
house without a half dozen
fraternity brothers to back him
up.

He may complain about
sleeping on a soft mattress, but
if he does, throw a raincoat
where the ants are the heaviest
and he will be happy.

In his first weeks at home, be
sure to leave the telephone off
the hook between dusk and
dawn. Should it happen to ring
during the night he might stag-
ger out of bed, shocking the
neighbors with violent profanity
while fumbling through his
belongings looking for his half-
filled fifth of vodka, and then
charging out of his room with a
handful of shoes, flinging them
at anything that moves,
shouting, “Dammit, I’ve gotta
test at 8:00!’ He may then
disappear for a few days (if you
have no commons room, check
the basement).

Show no alarm if he cries in
terror at the sight of roast beef,
pancakes, and pork roast, or
stares in wonder at ice cubes
floating in a glass. Don’t. worry
if he drinks beer with every
meal, pours gravy on his
dessert, or mixes peaches with
his macaroni.

With a little luck, his profani-
ty will soon decrease enough to
permit him to associate with
mixed groups, and not too long
afterward he should be speak-
ing as well as ever.

For the first few months be
extremely watchful when he is
around girls. Coming from
Washington and Lee, his first
reaction upon meeting one
might be to stare, pant, drool,
or faint, depending upon his
capacity for shock. A steel leash
is recommended.

Keep close watch. Keep in
mind that beneath his tanned,
beaten, dusty, and rugged ex-
terior there beats a heart of
gold. Treasure this, for it is the
only thing of value he has left.
Treat him with love, tolerance,
understanding, and an occa-
sional gallon of ice cream.

When you hear him muttering
to himself in the quiet of a home
town evening, respect his
solitude. If you hear him talking
of a road trip, get the car ready.
In either case, have faith in his
ability to return to the civilized
world.

So dust off the stereo and fill
the refrigerator with beer
because the ‘‘kid” is coming
home.

Hit by Rock

Editor
Ring-tum Phi

I am enclosing a letter sent to
the Executive Committee con-
cerning a head injury I received
at W&L. It has come to my at-
tention that the same sort of ac-
cident occurred three years ago
in the Freshman Quad, where a
student was hit by a falling
brick. Will a third ‘‘accident’’
have to occur before something
is done?

My accident was not major. I
lost a lot of blood but was only
stunned and required only one
stitch. However, I was lucky it
wasn’t worse! I’m writing you
in the hope that by publishing
this letter such negligence
(securing political banners over
entryways with bricks) will be
probibited in the future.

I do not seek to single out Rob
Benfield in particular, although
his banner provided the brick.
There were many other banners
waving in the wind. He has
already offered to pay the
hospital emergency expenses. I
hope as President of the EC, he
will initiate legislation against
such negligence.

Yours sincerely,
E.P. Claar

Executive Committee
Washington and Lee University
Dear Sirs:

On March 29, 1978 a brick
securing the banner of a ‘“‘Rob
Benfield”’ above the student Co-
op Building fell and smashed
me on the forehead.

I am writing this letter for
two purposes: first, to assure
that such obvious stupidity does
not occur in the future, for the
welfare of other individuals and
secondly, to. received
remuneration. The use of bricks
to hold down banners above
well frequented entryways
combined with the wind in the
Shenandoah Valley add up to a
fairly high probability of so-
meone getting hit. Given such
high probability of potential
danger, this ludicrous means of
posting campaign adver-
tisements should be prohibited.

I will send the _ hospital
emergency room bill and doctor
bill to you when they arrive. I
am sure that you will take care
of these compensatory
damages for me. Thank you.

Yours sincerely,
Elaine P. Claar

WLUR editorial

“Aired on WLUR May 10
as an editorial”’

In case anyone missed the
news Tuesday morning, the
Ring-tum Phi controversy is
finally over. In an 8-4 vote, the
Executive Committee voted for
a second time to retain Mike
Gallagher as editor of the Ring-
tum Phi. The ruling reversed a
Publications Board decision
which had dismissed the editor.
The second vote was necessary
as a constitutional requirement
and now the paper can — for
three more issues at least —
return to its old cantankerous
self.

The latest chapter in this saga
should come as no surprise,.
Despite it’s constitutional
necessity, it carried as much
punch as a ruling that the
Dallas Cowboys were world
champions two weeks after they
won the Super Bowl. Nobody
cares in either case — yet Mon-
day’s meeting was _ duly
reported py the local press.

It may serve a purpose —

albeit a small one — to flog this
long-dead horse one more time
for an obituary of the affir. The
whole controversy was, despite
all of the glowering phrases of
principle and freedom of the
press, no more than a tempest
in a teapot.
There were no winners in the
end, only losers. To build a poor
simile, it is like the Boy Scout
troop who happened upon a
skunk. No one was responsible
for what ensued, but no one
escaped smelling very clean
either.

Despite claims to the con-
trary, few in the journalism
department ever believed that
freedom of the press was an
issue in the affair. Yet Mr.
Gallagher, a math major, made
it a point that journalists were
rallying to his cause. In a show
aired on this station, two pro-
fessors expressed the opinion

 

that Mr. Gallagher was overdo-
jing the case.

Turning Point

(continued from page 3)
The director, Herbert Ross,

fails to do anything with the’

camera or the actors that you
haven’t seen a thousand times.
With the dancers, however, he
— the taste to just let the film
roll.

“The Turning Point’ was
nominated for 11 Oscars and
won none, like its siamese twin,
“Julia,” the big losers of the
year! Forget it. All you big
studs, so proud of your manly
gait — go enjoy enjoy an athlete
in his prime. Feel free to cheer.

Of course he was. And I would
have done the same thing. Spur-
red on by one tactical blunder
after another by parties involv-
ed, the mess was a spectacle
P.T. Barnum would have been
proud of. .

The ‘‘Rank-Tam Poon”’ edi-
tion of the paper was bathroom
humor at best and only mildly
amusing. The University acted
within its power in refusing to
allow it to be mailed out under
its postal permit. And the paper
was never censored, or con-
fiscated, as has been claimed.

But the University did over-
react in its attitudes and actions
following the beginning of the
affair. Their defensiveness pro-
bably initially blew it out of pro-
portion.

Mainly, the press is at fault
for the spectacle, for it fell into
a trap for which it is criticized
all too often: it generated more

‘news than was actually there,
and snowballed a small event
into a larger one. Mr. Gallagher
may be at fault here, as he has
admitted talking to the news
media to make sure the affair
got its coverage. Maybe the
event should have _ been
covered, but surely not as
grandly as was the case. There
is also something disconcerting
about Gallagher as a partici-
pant also being the link to the
press.

However, he had much to
gain by doing this, as he did
with the posters and bumper
stickers posted around campus
for him. There is no doubt these
were responsible for the large
turnout at the Pub _ board
meeting and the initial E.C.
meeting.

I also must confess some pre-
judice in this respect —as the
only news representative at the
second pub board meeting, I
gleefully reported it to the
papers, only to be later rejected
as a “p.r. flak.’”’ At the same
time, Mr. Gallagher, hardly an

Phi returns to its “old
cantankerous self”

impartial observer, was talking
to another paper, giving them
the story.

I was also in the same situa-
tion at the final E.C. meeting. I
did not consider it worthy
enough to feed to anyone. And
one E.C. member has said that
Gallagher told him that he
wanted to let the issue lie and
receive no more publicity. Yet
the story was in the papers
yesterday morning. How did it
get there?

Now that it is over, I will
neither condemn or applaud the
outcome. I remarked to the
Publications board at their se-
cond meeting that they were lit-
tle more than a lynch mob. Yet
the initial pub board meeting
was also a lynch mob with
Gallagher supporters. The
reasoning behind Gallagher’s
dismissal were basically sound.
But the board decision was one
of grossly bad timing, and that
is why they were defeated.

It was also amusing to hear
the arguments of precedence in
the final meeting. E.C. presi-
dent Jim Underhill was correct
in his statement that there is no
precedent being set and that
this will only be a fuzzy issue in
a couple of years. After all, who
remembers the reasons behind
the Great Spinners war of a
number of years ago? Was
there an urgent precedent set
there? .

Finally, all parties involved
should think twice about dragg-
ing in such ideas and words as
freedom of the press and using
it as loosely as it was used.
There was never any question
of freedom of the press in this
affair, never any danger of cen-
sorship. Freedom of the press is
important, of course, but used
in the wrong context, or as a
hiding spot, only erodes a
credibility the press has with
the public which is on shaky
enough ground anyway.....

The “Dig” uncovered

by Ned McDonnel

On a bluff behind the colon-
nade, behind the sports
stadium, and surrounded by
sweating, but constantly
dedicated workers, stands two
walls on either side of a high
reaching tree. These walls, the
only two substantive markers of
a structure long outlived in its
utility but still standing for the
history of two centuries past,
constitute structure number
two. Structure what? All this
smacks ofThe Charriots of the
Gods. But structure number
two is merely the code name of
the last standing ruins of Liber-
ty Hall used by the members of
the ‘‘dig” (a nickname for the
Liberty Hall Academy Ar-
chaeological Project).

Although the dig, as an ar-
chaeological enterprise has
gained respect throughout
Virginia, just what are the cir-
cumstances behind this
achievement? First, Liberty
Hall stands for an academy,
founded originally as Augusta
Academy by some
Presbyterian ministers in 1749
about seven miles north of what
is now Lexington. William
Graham took over in 1776 (the
name change bearing the evi-
dent patriotic fervor rampant in
the British segment of the New
World at that time). The
original Liberty Hall, standing
at Timber Ridge, closed in the
early 1780s, but Graham with a
few hard core students and a
farm in Lexington, sought to
rebuild Liberty Hall. In 1792, or
perhaps a few years before,
Graham hired an undertaker (a
colonial expression for a
building contractor) to con-
struct the new campus at the
present location of the ruins.
From it arose Liberty Hall itself
which closely resembled
Nassau Hall on the campus of
the nation’s first Presbyterian
college, Princeton. Several
other buildings, intrinsic to the
establishment of a functional
eighteenth century seminary or
college, were also erected by
the same undertaker.

From this morsel of history
emerges the story of the dig.
The ruins and subterranean
foundations passed unnoticed
for more than a century and a
half. But in 1973, Washington
and Lee archaeologist Dr. John
McDaniel began to initiate the
idea of a dig. The University,
endorsed the idea. John Arm-
strong (’77) Liberty Hall
scholar and second in command
for the 1978 season elucidated
the conception of the dig by say-
ing, ‘“Through the herculean ef-
forts of John McDaniel and the
good graces of the University,
the project has obtained a
number of grants which have
enabled us to do this research.”
To date the dig, principally
through the tireless efforts of its
instigator Dr. McDaniel, has
raised in excess of ninety thou-
sand dollars of funding from
foundations and_ private,
‘friends of the University’ con-
tributions.

The 1974 season, (a season
usually meaning, in this case, a
particular spring and, possibly
summer), was productive for
the dig. The premier season in-
cluded a lot of mechanical and

visual surveying. Mechanical
surveying consisted mainly of
“probes” and “‘test pits.” To ex-
ecute a probe, a brawny person,
perhaps a football player,
would drive stakes in the
ground on a consistent pattern
(such as a straight line or a grid
pattern). The depths to which
the stakes could be driven
varied dramatically. These pat-
tern shifts indicated a strong
possibility of the presence of
underground foundations. Test
pits, on the other hand (burrow-
ing several feet into the ground
and being circular with an ap-
proximated two to three foot
diameter) were dug at regular
intervals over the grounds of
the dig (which include a farm
house built fifty years after the
construction of Liberty Hall).
From these mechanical
surveys, two discoveries, that
of structures one and three,
were made. After further
research, structure number one
was hypothesized to be a three
floor steward’s house with
classrooms and dining facilities
on the first floor and living
quarters on the upper two
floors. Researchers establisbed
that structure number three
was a spring house storing
Liberty Hall’s supply of water.

Visual surveys, on the other
hand, sought to locate signify-
ing traits of past construction,
e.g. mounds, rocks protruding
from the ground, and _ir-
regularity in the pattern of
plant growth where the grass
above foundations may have
been dried out prematurely for
a lack of fertile ground due to a
short distance between the sur-
face and the foundations
themselves. The surveys were
greatly enhanced by arial
photographs obtained from
government agencies and a bor-
rowed helicopter. The one
tangible and most obvious
result of the visual appraisals
was wall structure number two
or the ruins of Liberty Hall
itself. These buildings were
erected by the same undertaker
from Rockingham.

A summer season, based on a
program in conjunction with
VMI, started in 1976. Along with
the agenda of the spring ses-
sion, Dr. McDaniel led his crew
to do some research on the Spr-
ing House (structure number
three).

Last spring, along with wrap-
ping up the undertakings of
previous years, the student ar-
chaeologists began working in
the area of the farm house built
in the mid-nineteenth century.
The efforts culminated in the
discovery of a brick kiln, an
oven used for manufacturing
bricks, dating back to the era of
Liberty Hall. Also discovered
were three sets of foundations
hidden until last year in the roll-
ing terrain surrounding the far-

mhouse. One of these founda-
tions dated back to the Liberty
Hall days while the dates of the
other two eluded (and still do)
the archaeologists. The sum-
mer session, under the same
format as the preceding year,
merely followed through on
these findings.

This year, aided by the efforts
of eight honor students in area
high schools and an extraor-
dinary number (about eighty)
of dedicated and hard working
students, the dig is making its
final push to complete the
mechanical and visual surveys,
a goal, Armstrong feels will be
achieved. But this season,
slated to be the last, has made
an unanticipated find in the
woods just behind the ruins of
structure number two. The
foundations, based upon ar-
tifacts found near the sight,
may well be another Liberty
Hall ecstacy. But, as second in
command Armstrong says,
“it’s too early to make any
definite conclusions.” This may
breathe some more life into an
investigation of our college’s
heritage, a heritage that never
really died.

The students who provide the
leadership and sense of direc-
tion necessary for the dig’s con-
tinuing success this year are
Parker Potter, Howard Smith,
Angus Finney, Buddy Bowie,
Jim Adams, Jesse Suber, Gard-
ner Umbarger, and Jim
Fineman. Specializing in dif-
ferent aspects, these young ar-
chaeology enthusiasts have
coordinated the dig to make it a
first rate project.

McDaniel himself observed
that the wealth of labor stems
from the cost effectiveness ($10
per pupil for the course) and the
suitability an intense thirty-
five-hour week holds for the spr-
ing terms. Finally, the result,
the legacy of the dig will be a
well documented book about the
dig, its goals, and its findings
written by the man behind the
dream.

74 bad checks outstanding

Cold Check Coiniites has $713 in

bounced student checks

The Cold Check Committee
has 74 bad student checks
amounting to $713.96 in its
possession, according to com-
mittee treasurer Jim Frantz,

Committee chairman Andrew
Sanders called the situation the
‘spring rush.’ ‘‘Judging from
past experience, I am_ op-
timistic that we can recover
most of the checks,’ he said.

“this is not an abnormal
amount ($713) for this time of
year. We were in the same
situation last year,’’ Sanders
said.

Frantz reported that the com-
mittee has handled 250 checks
this year amounting to $901.56,
not counting the 74 outstanding
checks.

The purpose of the Cold Check
Committee is to safeguard the
right of Washington and Lee

students to write checks to mer-
chants in town. The committee
picks up and pays merchants
for the ‘‘bounced”’ checks, then
calls in students for an explana-
tion and reinbursement for the
checks.

Sanders attributed ‘‘the
massive flow’’ of bad checks to
his committee this spring as a
result of many students running
out of money at the end of the
year.

With only two weeks remain-
ing before graduation, Sanders
said his committee ‘‘will try to
have two meetings next week”’
to account for the outstanding
checks and be reinbursed for
their amount before summer
vacation.

“We'll have to rely on the
committee members to run peo-
ple down,”’ Sanders said, but he

noted that his committee is cur-

rently short on manpower.
Seniors who leave school with
checks still in the possession of
the Cold Check Committee will
have their transcripts frozen

until they: make their checks ©

good, Sanders said.

The committee has the
authority to levy a fine of up to
$5 for the first offense, $10 for
the second offense, and $15 for a
third appearance before the
committee. Frantz said that as
of yesterday $86 had been col-
lected from 40 students in fines
for bad checks this year.

“A lot of students bounce
checks and its not their fault,”
Sanders said. ‘‘Or a
mathematical error has caused
a miscalculation on their part.”’

‘Our job is to try to keep the

Med. School Acceptances Down

by Randy Smith

Two weeks before
Washington and Lee’s gradua-
tion ceremonies, only five of 20
seniors applying to medical
school have been accepted.
Five other applicants are on the
waiting list at medical schools.

Last year at this time, 19 out
of 38 seniors who applied to
medical school had been ac-
cepted, or 50 percent. Three
students were on the waiting
list; all were accepted after
graduation.

A number of sophomore and
junior undergraduate pre-med
students have expressed con-
cern about the current situation
because two of the five seniors
on the waiting list are Phi Beta
Kappa scholars.

Much mud, slung

John Sacco, one of the Phi
Beta Kappas, says ‘‘the pro-
blem is not as great as it seems.
It’s still early.’’ Sacco pointed
out that some medical schools
accept students up to a week
before classes begin.

The final figure for 1977, as
reported by the biology depart-
ment, is that 29 out of 47 ap-
plicants to medical schools
were accepted (W&L
graduates who reapply are
counted in with the senior
class). The biology department
figure raises the medical school
acceptance rate to 61.7 percent
for that year.

This year, the biology depart-
ment reports the acceptance
figure as 10 out of 25, or 40 per-
cent. Five of the 10 accepted are

Muckrakers vs. Gondoliers

The Ring-tum Phi found out
today that top. salaried
superstar Pete Goss will not
play for the Muckrakers in Fri-
day’s contest against the WLUR
Gondoliers. It is rumored that
Gondolier coach Bob deMaria
offered Goss plenty of bucks not
to play in the game between the
two rivals. It is believed by in-
siders that since Goss was not
going to receive a salary as
business manager of the RtP
this year, he readily accepted
deMaria’s offer.

The Muckraker-Gondolier
softball contest is a grudge
match initiated by the WLUR
staff against the RtP’s group of
high quality journalists. Realiz-
ing the Gondoliers could not
outreport the Muckrakers,
deMaria sought his revenge by
challenging Muckraker player-
coach Mike Gallagher’s team.

‘“‘We’rea gonna show thosea
hot shots. Ifa they can’ta play
fair in the news business, wea
won’t playa fair on the softball
field,” said deMaria.

Gallagher apparently ex-
pected such a statement from
deMaria. “I don’t expect that
dago to play fair. He never has.
His team isn’t even comprised
of journalists. They are mostly
his associates from the Friends
of Italy Lodge, Buena Vista
Chapter Number 33. Ask Mark
Mainwaring, their program
director, if you don’t believe
me.”

Mainwaring confirmed this.
‘Most of our guys are enrolled
in Journalism 140 and don’t
know a thing about journalism.
DeMaria just picked them up
off th- street and signed them up
for his course in hopes of

U.C. elections

continue
today

Monday’s University Council
election produced only two
distinct winners, neither of
whom were on the ballot.

Jeff Bartlett and Tim Brooks
won the two openings for junior
representatives to the U.C. Both
were write-in candidates. No
rising juniors had submitted
their names to the Executive
Committee for the U.C. spots
before the election.

The crowded fields in the
other two academic classed re-
mained crowded for today’s
run-off election.

On Monday, John Boatwright
(with 46 votes), Edward Mintz
(39), Bob Mullican (62), and Joe
Robles (46) stayed in contention
for the two openings for U.C.
sophomore representatives.
Warren Kean (29) and Madison
Woodward (19) were dropped
from today’s run-off.

To fill the two senior
representative positions on next
year’s University Council, six
current juniors remained in the
running: Monk Hamra (39),
Doug Lane (35), Rob Atkinson
(28), Doug Adams (22), Pete
Williams (23), and Doug Byrd
(21). Preston Waldrop (15) was
the only candidate removed
from the ballot.

Senator Sam Ervin

Senator Sam Ervin:
resisting temptation

Former Senator Sam Ervin
told a Washington and Lee au-
dience Tuesday night that
politicians often succumb to
three temptations: ‘‘a love for
money, a lust for power, and
choosing between what is right
and what is politically expe-
dient.”

Speaking before a_ large
crowd in Lee Chapel, Ervin
mixed ‘“‘down-home’”’ homilies
with advice as he spoke on
political ethics and national af-
fairs.

Ervin gained national pro-
minance as chairman of the
Select Senate Committed on
Watergate. He said during
questioning that Richard Nixon
was guilty of obstruction of
justice and conspiracy to
obstruct justice.

Ervin also said that although
he has only thumbed through
the former _president’s
memoirs, he thinks that Nixon
may have borrowed a phrase
from Mark Twain in writing it:

“The truth is very precious, so
use it sparingly.”

Ervin joked that a friend had
commented to him upon learn-
ing that the subject of his
speech was to be political
ethics. that ‘“‘it will be a short
speech, because there isn’t
anything to say.”’

He said that people have lost
“confident in their govern-
ment, politicians and the
political process....Whenever,
men or women decide to have
nothing to do with politics, then
we are all condemned to live
under a bad government.”

Ervin said that although
there are such temptations on
politicians, ‘‘the majority do not
succumb to evil for mercenary
gains.”

Ervin explained that he found
it helpful to resist the tempta-
tions by anchoring himself
down with a verse or a poem.

“T -have to live with myself
and so

Are concerts worth the
expense and trouble?

by David Blackwood

The Student Activities Board
announced a loss of $8,040 from
last Thursday night’s Harry
Chapin concert.

Although the crowd of ap-
proximately 500 students did
not seem to notice, there were
numerous last minute com-
plications in producing the
show.

To begin with, the supervisor
from the promotional company
was a no-show. Normally, it
would be his responsibility to
iron out any problems between
the band and the school. As it
was, he missed a busy day.
First of all, it was discovered
the the band’s grand piano and
a set of stage lights were in a
truck somewhere near

Washington, too far away to ar-
rive in time for the concert.
This problem was complicated
by the late arrival of two
members of the band who had
taken a late flight from New
York.

When the duo finally made
their appearance, one was
found to have lost his instru-
ment, a cello, to an airline
strike. Until Dr. Knudson
graciously lent his cello, the
band played shorthanded.

Sunday’s festivities at the
Pavillion were also a challenge
to arrange. Through the course
of the week, three bands
cancelled one after another.
Finally a band, Thunderchief,
was found at 7 a.m. Sunday

Next Year’s E.C.
Takes The Initiative

Budget
Guidlines

Finalized

Next year’s Executive Com-
mittee has already taken steps
to insure that proper budgeting
procedures are adhered to.

Budgets to be submitted to
the E.C. by subcommittee
chairmen and treasurers in
September ‘‘should be as detail-
ed andas itemized as possible.”

In addition, the E.C. wil re-
quire ‘written monthly reports
on committee activities,’ said
next year’s student body presi-
dent Bo Dudley in a letter to all
newly appointed subcommittee
chairmen. The reports will in-
clude planned activities for the
upcoming month, a financial
statement, and a report on the
acivities of the committee in the
preceding month.

Dudley also said that a year-
end financial statement will be
required of each subcommittee,
to be submitted in May 1979.

 

 

“Views of W&L”

on display in bookstore

“Views of Washington and
Lee and Virginia Military In-
stitute,’ a collection of prints,
etchings and dry-point engrav-
ings, will be on display at the
Washington and Lee University
Bookstore through June 7.

The exhibit features prints by
I-Hsiung Ju, associate pro-
fessor of art and_artist-in-
residence at W&L, and Turner
McGehee, a 1975 graduate of
W&L who has studied under Ju

since his graduation.

All of McGehee’s prints are
color serigraphical, or silk-
screen processed. Ju’s prints
are a combination of silk-
screens, etchings and dry-point
engravings. The dry-point
engravings are made by using a
fine needle to etch intricate
lines on a metal plate without
the use of acid.

The bookstore is open
weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30
p.m.

Soul, Rock, or neither

(continued from page 1)

morning.

As it turned out, Thunderchief
and the Second Hand Band
played to nearly 600 bear chugg-
ing, hot dog consuming
students. The results were 16
empty kegs and 15 digested
weenies.

Although the results of the
event seemed pleasurable to
those who attended, there were
some questions raised as to
whether Washington and Lee
can effectively put on a big con-
cert.

The SAB runs into a number
of problems .in putting on a
show. Because pressure from
the student body is always pre-
sent, the SAB has to try to ob-
tain entertainment that will ap-
peal to a majority of students.

Harry Chapin was neither
soul nor rock but, unfortunate-
ly, only appealed to a small
number of students.

Even after a band has been
selected, there is a good chance
that the group will break its
contract. Washington and Lee is
not along a major concert tour
and, thus, is often dropped when
a more convenient location is
convenient location is found.

 

“Harry Chapin was neither
soul nor rock but, un-
fortunately, only appealed
to a small number of
students.”

 

The bands feel free to do this
because they know it is not
worth our while to take them to
court. Even if we could force a
contract-breaking band to keep
their date, there is no guarantee
that the band would not seek
musical vengeance through a
bad concert.

Pub. Board - E.C.
showdown tabled

In a meeting called to discuss

the status of the Ring-tum Phi,

the Executive Committee failed
to achieve a quorum. Several
problems were _ solved,
however, clearing the way for
publication of this week’s
paper.

Last week, after the Ex-
ecutive Committee overruled
the Publications Board’s deci-
sion to fire the editor, J.
Michael Gallagher, the board
refused to publish any more
issues of the Ring-tum Phi. Ina
statement posted on campus,
the Publications Board said,
“The Board cannot accept
responsibility for publications
for which it is not an
authoritative body. Until this
matter is resolved, the publica-

 

Automatic

AUTOMATIC RULE

The Committee on _ the
Automatic Rule will meet at
10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, June 6,
1978. At that time the Commit-
tee will consider whether or not
to reinstate immediately the
following groups of students
who have fallen under the
Automatic Rule:

1. those students completing a
full academic year who failed to
meet the cumulative average
required of their class;

2. those students not com-
pleting a full academic year
who failed to meet the condi-
tions of Academic Probation re-
quired of them by the end of the
current Spring Term.

The committee will consider
for immediate reinstatement
all students who fall under the
Automatic Rule. If any student
wishes to inform the Committee
of any extenuating cir-
cumstances, he may write a let-
ter to the Committee and
deliver it to the Office of the
Dean of the College before June
6.

A student who falls under the
Automatic Rule severs his con-
nection with the University. If
the Committee does not grant
him immediate reinstatement
(reinstatement is the exception
rather than the rule), he may
apply for reinstatement after a

Rule and Academic Pro

minimum of one year. As soon
as possible after the Commit-
tee’s meeting, each student fall-
ing under the Automatic Rule
will receive a letter explaining
his status. His parents will
receive a copy of that letter.

ACADEMIC PROBATION

Any student who is not sub-
ject to the Automatic Rule in
June (one who has not com
pleted a full year then) and who
fails to achieve the cumulative
average required for his class
will be on Academic Probation
for the Fall Term. He and his
parents will be notified of his
status.

tion of the Ring-tum Phi shall
cease...” Following this deci-
sion, however, the E.C.,
through its own authority, per-
mitted the publication of the
paper. E.C. President Jim
Underhill said at the Tuesday
meeting that he had only plann-
ed to underwrite one issue of
theRing-tum Phi to allow the
E.C. enough time to resolve the
matter. The Publications Board
solved the problem of financing
this week’s edition of the Phi
when it indicated its willingness
to make up the difference bet-
ween advertising revenue and
production costs. The Pub
Board members said they were
willing to take financial respon-
sibility for the paper, but not the
publishing responsibility. The
Executive Committee will con-
sider the matter further after
its regularly scheduled meeting
on Monday.

Finally, there is the problem
of guaging student attendance.
Soul concerts are heavily oppos-
ed while rock concerts are bad-
ly attended.

Harry Chapin now proves
that a group in_ neither
category, rock nor soul, is also
rejected by the student body.
Bill Tucker, chairman of the
SAB, had predicted 1,000 to
1,200 students to attend the
Chapin:concert, but only half
that number did so.

To Tucker, the only alter-
native left is for a Southern
‘boogie’ band. Indeed, there
was an effort to get the Outlaws
and Sea Level, but the deal fell
through when both bands were
offered a more attractive offer.

Despite the low attendance
record at big concerts, the SAB
plans to continue its attempts at
big name entertainment. The
feeling seems to be that the ef-
fort is worth the pain.

Cockpit presents Glenn
Phillips this weekend

Glenn Phillips is just back
from an astoundingly  suc-
cessful twenty-week tour of
England. During °77 Phillips’
last two records stayed con-
sistently in the top five of all
British import LP’s. The Glenn
Phillips group is coming up
from Atlanta and will play in
the Cockpit the Friday and
Saturday. Terrific, huh?

WHO IS GLENN PHILLIPS?

Reviews of his past albums
have included references to Jeft
Beck, Jimmy Page, Jimi Hen-
drix, Carlos Santana, John
McLaughlin, Mike Oldfield,
Frank Zappa, and many others
when describing his artistry on
the guitar.

YES, BUT WHO IS GLENN
PHILLIPS?

. The person who might answer
that question best would be
Glenn himself. The following is
an exerpt from some copy
Glenn Phillips wrote last sum-
mer to help promote his English
tour: ‘‘Glenn Phillips started
playing guitar when he was six-
teen. He jammed to blues
records in Atlanta. One year
later he formed the Hampton
Grease Band with Bruce Hamp-
ton. He couldn’t play much.
“The Hampton Grease Band
lasted six years. In that time it
supported Alice Cooper in New
Jersey, the Mothers at the
Fillmore East, Three Dog Night
in Alabama, Fleetwood Mac
and the Grateful Dead in Atlan-
ta, B.B. King and John Mayall

“Little Mary” is hokey,

by Melissa Nelson
and J. Michael Gallagher

From the opening piano duet
to the closing number, you are
glad you were there, you are
glad it is over, but you don’t
know why. Little Mary Sun-
shine is a spoof of the
melodrama, especially the
Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. If
you can't remember how
‘hokey’? Gilbert and Sullivan
could be, Mary Sunshine will re-
mind you.

The play is complete with its

Dudley Do-Right and Nell, and
Dick Dasterdly, and the ill-
fated story which, of course,
has a happy ending. It is set in
Colorado where Mary Sunshine
is running an inn for bacheloret-
tes, and occasionally a few
male visitors.

The women in the play are
portrayed as the typical. hus-
band hunting females (aren’t
we all), and the males are out
for all they can get (of course).

The story opens with the ar-
rival of “Big Jim,’’(alias
Dudley Do-Right), and
company—the Forest Rangers.
A group of young ladies from
Eastchester Finishing School
just happen to be arriving at the
inn that day, too.

Both groups long for
members of the opposite sex,
find each other, and, of course,
fall in love.

But everything is not hap-
piness and sunshine; clouds ap-
pear on the horizon: the villain,
Yellow Feather. At that point,
the men are forced to leave the
ladies to ensure that justice
prevails.

After repeated choruses of
‘‘Look for a sky of blue,’’ you’re

remember. Usually the au-
dience would throw things, the
other half would scream for
more. I mean really scream.
“At a 1970 Atlanta pop
festival, Glenn and the band
played before Columbia
records. They were signed.
They made a double album
‘Music to Eat’ as their recor-
ding debut. Then Columbia
fired them. In 1972, Bruce
Hampton left town (Atlanta).
The Hampton Grease Band split
up. Glenn and the former drum-

’ mer Jerry Fields formed Stump

Brothers. Later that year,
Stump Brothers supported Lit-
tle Feat at the Twelfth Gate,
Atlanta. Lowell George took one
look at Glenn Phillips and said,

reminded that things have to
get better, because in stories
like this, they always do. Sure
enough, the men return, justice
has been done, and everyone
will live happily ever after.

The actors of Little Mary Sun-
shine did a good job with what
could have turned out as an
overdone satire. David Sorrells
did an adequate job with ‘Capt.
‘Big Jim’ Warington’’, although
he needs to loosen up on stage
when he is not delivering a line.

Last Thursday night, despite
the small crowd (490 tickets
were sold at last count), despite
the piano from the Cockpit in-
stead of a grand, and despite
the celloist’s cello being held up
in a Northwestern airlines
strike, Harry Chapin and his
band played.

The concert, which was
scheduled for 8 p.m., did not
start until 8:45 p.m.,and it was
another forty-five minutes or so
before the celloist showed up to
complete the band (after
wandering around campus try-
ing to borrow a cello). The con-
cert started with Chapin doing a
few numbers by himself, one of
them a relatively new song
“Dancing Boy;’’ a nice sen-
timental song about his son, but
also rather dull. Then his band
(one of his stronger points) con-
sisting of brother Steve on the
piano, a bassist, lead guitarist,
drummer, and celloist, ap-
peared on stage amidst an ex-
tremely well-done light-show.
Throughout the concert it
became evident, as had been
assumed, that Chapin himself is
probably less able than his col-

Chapin entertains
scocccccooccen, SIMA! crowd of 500

leagues as far as guitar playing
ability goes. He is, however, a
very talented songwriter (he
writes his own material) and
the crowd enjoyed his songs.
The band sounded very good
together, expecially on a jaz-
zrock workout of a song entitled
“*Sniper.”’

According to Bill Tucker of
the SAB, the Activities Board
took an $8,000 loss on the con-
cert. Tucker said, ‘We
budgeted the concert for a
$6,000 loss, so it was about what
we expected.” Tucker also
stated that this was the normal
loss on a concert.

Although Chapin’s musical
ability is rather mediocre at
times, he is the classic
showman, and this, above
everything else, is what makes
a Chapin concert so worthwhile.
He knows how to handle an au-
dience by telling jokes and
stories and poking fun at the au-
dience as well as at himself. All-
in-all, it was a good concert, and
well worth the four dollar ad-
mission charge. But even more,
it was certainly a refreshing
change from the Spinners and
Archie Bell and the Drells.

THE

RING-TUM PHI

Tennis Team Ends Season;

Playoffs Ahead

by Mike Farrand
Rain muddied the end of the
tennis team’s 1978 regular
season but they managed to
play one and a half matches and
finish with a record of 9-11.

Tuesday against Salisbury
State the Generals were vic-
torious 4-3 in a match that end-
ed early due to rain. At An-
napolis the next day, W&L’s
netmen met the Naval
Academy's Midshipmen and
vot torpedoed 8-1; only Johns-
Jackson won in doubles. The
match with Emory and Henry
for last Saturday was cancelled
because of rain.

Ben Johns, Stewart Jackson,
Cody Davis, Doug Gaker, and
Pat Norris are noticeably ab-
sent from campus this week
because they are in Delaware,
Ohio trying to win the national
Division II] championship for
W&L. Four singles players and
two doubles teams, consisting
of Ben Johns-Stewart Jackson

and Cody Davis-Pat Norris,
make up the Generals’ fighting
force in Ohio. Last season the
netment came home from the
national tournament as
America’s number two team,
tying with ClaremontMudd and
losing to Swarthmore. This
year, however, the Generals
are favored.

After playing Division I
teams of high stature all year
the team should be well tuned.
Tennis U.S.A. thinks so at least
and named W&L the top team,
Claremont-Mudd, Kalamazoo,
and Swarthmore following in
order. The double duo of Johns
and Jackson looks particularly
strong and may repeat their na-
tional doubles championship of
last year and once again be
named All-Americans. Pat Nor-
ris and Cody Davis as a team
have also performed well this
year. The tournament runs
from May 17-20 and chances are
good that the Generals will
return as national champions
on Saturday.

Maatman Goes To Nationals

Senior captain Jerry Maat-
man will be the lone W&L
representative participating in
the 1978 Division III national
golf championships being held
May 23-26 at Wooster, Ohio.

The Wilmette, Ill. native
finished sixth individually last
year in being accorded All-
American honors, W&L’s first
ever in golf. The Generals were
selected as a team in 1977 and
finished seventh nationally.
Coach Buck Leslie was visably
dissappointed upon learning

Awards
Banquet

Announced

The 1978 Washington and Lee
All Sports Award Barbeque will
be held on Tuesday, May 23
beginning at 5:00 PM on W&L’s
Wilson Field. In the event of in-
clement weather, the award
ceremony will be held in W&L's
Warner Center.

Three special awards will be
presented at that time including
the Preston K. Brown Memorial
Award to the University’s Most
Valuable Athlete in 1977-78. Also
presented will be the Mink
Glasgow Spirit and Sportsman-
ship Award and the Outstanding
Freshman Athlete Award. Each
intercollegiate sport will pre-
sent its two major awards at the
barbeque as will the W&L in-
tramural program.

 

that nis team was not selected
as a group this season.

Only two schools from
District III were selected and
W&L was not one of them. Con-
sidering the fact that the
Generals are currently 8-0 with
only Thursday’s match at
Roanoke remaining, Leslie has
reason for his dissappointment.

The team was idle last week
and concludes the 1978 year on
Thursday playing the Maroons
in an ODAC match. W&L
defeated Roanoke 392-397
earlier inthe month.

Lacrosse Team Ends Season

With 12-2 Loss At Cornell

Unable to dent the net of Cor-
nell goalie John Griffin,
Washington and Lee’s Lacrosse
Generals saw their season come
to a close by a 12-2 score yester-
day at Schoellkopf Field in the
quarterfinal round of the NCAA
University Division Playoffs.
Although ranked ninth in the
final USILA poll of the season
following last Saturday’s 12-6
disaster at the hands of Hofstra,
W&L still gained a Playoff bid
for the seventh straight year.

 

and were pitted against the Big
Red of Cornell, owners of a 40-
game winning season which
spans three seasons.

Cornell lengthened this winn-
ing streak yesterday at W&L’s
Expense, shutting out the
Generals for the first 36 minutes
of the game while pumping
eight shots by goalie Charlie
Brown.

The eight goal deficit could
not be made up by the W&L
sticman who went after Cornell
aggressively at the game’s
outset. Brownwas successful at
first in stopping the Big Red at-
tack and clearing the ballto his
teammates. On offense, John
Kemp narrowly missed two
goals, one hitting a pipe.

eighth for the post seasonaffair,

track,with Craig Jaeger feeding
BobHendrickson twice within a
minute as Cornell took a 2-0
lead.

Jaeger then won the ensuing
faceoff, raced toward W&L’s
goal, and fired in Cornell's third
goal of the game. By the end of
the first quarter, the Generals
had outshot the Big Red 9-8 but
were losing 4-0. ‘

Griffin held tough against the
Generels in period number two,
stoppingpoint blank shots by
Johnny Black. Sandy McDonald

    
 

found the nets four times, two
on assists by Steve Page, and
the difference at halftime was
8-0.

W&L played tough defense in
the third quarter, allowing only
one score,but Griffen was
outstanding for Cornell and the
Generals beat him only once.
That goal came at the 8:14
mark off of John Kemp’s stick.
It was the first goal W&L has
scored on Cornell in the last
seven quarters ofof play bet-
ween the two teams.

Jay Foster made it 9-2 early
in the fourth quarter but it was
too late by this time.

Bussard

Dennis R._ Bussard,
Washington and Lee’s tennis
coach and assistant basketball
coach, has resigned his _posi-
tions to accept the head basket-
ball coaching job at Babson Col-
lege in Wellesly Massachuset.
In addition to being head
basketball coach at Babson,
Bussard will also be Assistant
Athletic Director.

As head tennis coach at W&L,

had another pipe shot. Cornell

reeling on Saturday.

The Flying Dutchman con-
trolled the tempo of the contest
and outshot W&L 53-33, in gain-
ing the victory that earned
Hofstra a place in the NCAA
tournament.

Hofstra’s Paul Sanit had
sevensaves in the contest while
brown stopped 13 shots. W&L’s
attack duo of Black and Jeff
Fritz had three goals and. five
assists between them.

The Generals finished the up-
and-down vear with a record of

re ale .

9-5 and a ranking of ninth in the

nation. Although W&L will

sorely miss the efforts of the

five graduating seniors, xt
years prospects lookbright.

The Generals young midfield
and defense will be a year older
and a year more experienced.
Black and Fritz will botth be
seniors, and they-will be joined
by Chris Kearney, W&L’s big-
gest gun last year who decided
to take a .year off. Bob
Clements, an All-American
goalie in highschool, should be
able to fill the shoes of Brown
for the next two seasons.

 
    

resigns

Bussard has received Coach of
the Year honors for the past
four years, with the last two
years being ODAC honors. The
tennis team this year, as was
the case last year, were ODAC
champs. This year thetennis
team was ranked number one in
Division III, and are currently
playing in the Nationals in
Delaware, Ohio.

No successor for Bussard has

‘He is the most amazing

‘‘Lowell George took tapes of
the band to Warner Brothers.
They loved them. The deal fell
through. Jerry Fields left town
(Atlanta). Bass player Mike
Holbrook left town (Atlanta). It
was late 1972. In early 1973,
Glenn Michael Phillips’s father
committed suicide. Now there
was no Hampton Grease Band.
There was no Stump Brothers.
There was even no Mr. Phillips.
His father was dead. There was
just Glenn. Two years later, in
February 1975, ‘Lost at Sea’
was released in Atlanta on
Glenn’s own label. It was
greeted with wild acclaim...
‘There is in America a highly

The Phi has discovered that
deMaria has used money in the
past to lure free agents away
from the Muckrakers’ team.
Dave Abrams, Ben Keesee, and
Sandy Bishop have jumped
from the Muckrakers to the
Gondoliers. Though Gallagher
maintains they were fired, he
admitted that the three just
were not dedicated enough jour-
nalists for him. “They don’t
know what real muck is.”’

Las Vegas odds on the game
are 6-2 Muckrakers. Newark
odds are 5-4 in favor of the Gon-
doliers, and Washington Hall,
as it has in the past, has picked
the Muckrakers to fail in their
attempt against the Gondoliers.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

IT'S GOOD To KNOW I'M TAKING

PRE-MED COURSES WITH ONLY
A add, (CHANCE OF GETTING

Year end praises

No sour grapes, Bill, you are an alright guy. For
once you did something to deserve praise. It took guts
to put ona concert you knew was going to lose money.

The money loss was worth it. The concert was good.
Chapin may be the best performer to appear at
Washington and Lee ever. . Even though $8000 was
lost, it is better to lose money and put on a concert
than to lose money and cancel a concert.

Students should not forget the SAB is supposed to
lose money. In fact, it is supposed to spend all the
money the E.C. allocates to it. The money is spent on
entertainment for the student body. Twenty-five per-
cent of the student body enjoyed Chapin. The only loss
resulting from the concert is that of the 75 percent
who chose not to attend.

* * Ss & *

While I’m feeling good and have nothing better to
write, I might as well praise the E.C. After all, they
are now the RtP’s publishers.

Seriously, the E.C. has done a commendable job
this year. The student body has been made to be
responsible. Student committees are now required to
keep acurate records. The individual members have
been unafraid to speak out for what they believe. The
honor code has been upheld in many cases.

Now, the E.C. has gone above and beyond the call of
duty. They will supply a keg of beer to students at the
next E.C. meeting. An E.C. meeting will be enjoyable
for once. This action is more responsible than having
a $240 party for themselves, as was the case last year.

*s & © © 8

Personal to the person who left part of himself in a
cup in the Cockpit Friday night: Sir, you are a cad,
disgusting, and a disgrace to the student body. You
are not a gentleman,sir.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

“Dig” writing critized

Editor:

The article appearing in last
week’s Ring-tum Phi on the
Liberty Hall excavations was a
great disappointment. One
would assume that if an article
cannot be factually accurate, it
could at least be well written.
Ned McDonnel’s article was
neither.

To cite just one of the article’s
numerous technical errors, test
pits are never ‘‘approximately
two to three feet in diameter,”’
but are exactly one meter
square. (Further, I’ve seen
many test pits dug, but I’ve
never seen one ‘“‘burrowed.’’)

McDonnel’s_ writing style
hurts his article even more. The
openning sentence is a fair
reflection of his story as a
whole: “On a bluff behind the
colonnade, behind the sports
stadium, and surrounded by
sweating, but constantly
dedicated workers, stands two
walls on either side of a high
reaching tree.”’ This mouthful
reads like a bad Victorian
diary. I would suggest to Mr.
McDonnel that these kind of ruf-

fles are better left to pulp
romantic novels than _ to

“serious journalism.”
The story’s greatest
weakness, however, is_ its

failure to even mention the ef-
forts of Hank McKelway.
McKelway is one of the most
central and important
members of the Liberty Hall
staff.

As site surveyor, McKelway
performs one of the most vital
and demanding functions on the
dig: mapping. The importance
of mapping to the entire opera-
tion is another area McDonnel
failed to mention.

While the members of the
Liberty Hall archeaological
project appreciate any publici-
ty, it is a shame that McDonnel
could not have done more
justice to a project that has
brought W&L so much prestige
and publicity.

About the only area McDon-
nel covered was a description of
Dr. McDaniel’s efforts. Those,
if anything, were understated.

Edward L. Bowie, ‘80

 

Famous?

 

Dear Mr. Gallagher:

My name is Randy Parks and
I am enrolled in a second-year
Latin course. For a project we
were to select several famous
personalities and inquire of
them their personal Latin ex-
perience.

Sir, at any time in your life
have you taken a Latin course?
If so, has it helped you to be suc-
cessful in your work? Thank
you very much for you time.

Sincerely yours
Randy Parks

DuPont - Gordon

Editor:

You're slipping a little, Mike.
All year long you've undertaken
the noble task of sacrificing
your campus image with the
status quo to expose the waste,
injustice, and abuse abundant
in many parts of the student
body. Anyone who is truly con-
cerned with student life here

(continued on page 7)

Student blasts Phi; defends Gordon

Editor:
After the post-election issue

of the Phi, I did not think the

editorial position of the paper
could slip any lower. This week
you said that the Publications
Board acted like a spoiled child
in suspending the Ring-tum Phi.
Yet wasn’t your own, self-
serving editorial about your
election defeat much worse?
The Phi is not your paper. It
belongs to the University, as the
flag used to proclaim and as you
are so fond of pointing out.

Thus I was surprised to find
that this week’s issue contained
even more non-news than usual,
details that seem to serve ho
other purpose than
demonstrating your own posi-
tion as editor. The first two
stories on the left side of the
front page were stale when they
were written. The student body,
which you claim to represent so
well, has grown sick of the
“Rank-tam Poon Controversy”

(largely manufactured, I think)

as they were of the content of
that humorless magazine. And
yet this week you also included
a copy of a WLUR editorial, as
well as an extra, boxed, diatribe
against the Pub. Board. Will
you please let the issue die?

But the most incredible part
of this week’sPhi is the editorial
attacking Dr. Al Gordon for
closing DuPont Auditorium to
future SAB use because of
repeated student misbehavior.
Mr. Gallagher, you claim that
we have a ‘right’ to use the
auditorium for other than
academic purposes. (A rather
shaky claim.) But you also imp-
ly that we have the perrogative
to treat it irresponsibly. This
deplorably selfish attitude is
again apparent when you sug-
gest that students calling
University officials should, if
they wish, remain anonymous.
Are the students too cowardly to
give their names? The “W&L
Gentleman” is a
theme of yours. Would you find

frequent.

this almost extinct individual
placing anonymous calls to the
home of Dean John, or Presi-
dent Huntley? I think not.

You have felt no reservation
about criticizing Dr. Gordon’s
action. But have you taken the
trouble to investigate the
precise nature of his respon-
sibilities to the University ad-
ministration in this instance?
And have you even bothered to
phone Dr. Gordon, as you sug-
gest we do?

One other thing bothered me
about your editorial. You rudely
relegate the filthy chore of
cleaning DuPont after movies
to the members of the Buildings
and Grounds department. You
imply that these dedicated men
are, in fact, menials whose only
job is to tidy up after selfish,
gross students. I think you
should apologize. What you
should have done was attack the
students for making the mess in
the first place. It seems rather

(continued on page 7)

and the wide disparity between
the professed and the practical
philosophies of W&L should
salute you and your efforts to
get the student body here to
wake up and, more important-
ly, grow up.

But perhaps the weight of
constant pressure to conform
has blinded you somewhat. The
editorial bit you wrote on the
‘‘Gordon-DuPont’’ decision
stinks. In it you reflect the im-
mature, irresponsible values
that so characterize the parts of
the student body you and I have
have both come to despise, that

group of overgrown youngsters .

who have falsely conceived this
school to be no more than a
finishing school for boys.

You correctly make the point
that DuPont is ‘‘ours.” But why
don’t we treat it like ours? You
engage in petty buck-passing by
shifting the burden to Buildings
and Grounds, our ‘‘maids’”’ and
“cleaning ladies,’’ no? What is
so difficult, so mind-boggling
about each student being
responsible for his own ac-
tions? Is it so terrible to simply
take with you what you’ve
brought? You may point out
the seeming triviality of this
argument, but I might add that
ignorance of this triviality has
cost all of us a very suitable
theater. We abused a privilege.
We didn’t deserve to keep it.

‘Moot Court

remarks

Editor:

In regard to the article
printed in the last issue of the
Phi covering the law school’s
Burks Moot Court competition,
I would like to emphazise that

the ‘‘quote”’ concerning my opi- |

nion of the Moot Court problem
was neither an accurate nor a
representative reflection of my
feelings regarding the competi-
tion. Frankly, I do not recall
having responded to an inter-
view question in the manner
quoted by the Phi: Unfortunate-
ly, the purported quote was a
gross misrepresentation of my
high regard for the competition.

The Burks Scholars and their
advisor Professor Anne Unver-
zagt deserve much gratitude

A research paper written by a
Washington and Lee University
journalism professor, analyzing
the effectiveness with which
broadcasters in small radio-
Station markets determine
community needs and _ pro-
blems, has been chosen as one
of three winning research pro-
jects in a national competition.

The paper, ‘‘Community
Ascertainment - Practices’ of
Small-Market Broadcasters
under the FCC’s Second
Primer,” is by R. H. Mac-
Donald, professor of journalism
and head of the Department of
Journalism and Communica-
tions. The competition was
sponsored by the Broadcast
Education Association, the
educational affiliate of the Na-
tional Association of Broad-
casters.

MacDonald’s research
evaluated the techniques used

munities of less than 1,000

population in meeting Federal
Communications Commission
(FCC) requirements that they
maintain lists of local pro-
blems. Licensed broadcast sta-
tions are expected by the FCC
to help address those problems.
In larger markets, ‘‘ascertain-
ment surveys’ are required,
but small-market broadcasters
have been exempt from the
survey requirement since 1976.

MacDonald visited 11 radio
stations in 10 small Vermont
towns over a five-week period
last summer, interviewing sta-
tion managers and community
leaders. He found an acceptable
level of agreement on local pro-
blems, and then used U.S. Cen-
sus date to extrapolate his Ver-
mont data sample to a nation-
wide conclusion -- that small-
town station managers succeed
in discerning community pro-
blems with reasonable ac-
curacy, but that the cutoff
should probably not be raised
above the 1,000-population
level.

MacDonald, a native of Ver-
mont who had his first jobs in
broadcasting there, joined the
W&L journalism faculty in 1969
after 13 years with WDBJ-TV
News in Roanoke.

Med school acceptances

(continued from page 1)

(The biology department's
acceptance figure for 1976 is
70.4 percent of those students
and graduates who applied. )

Both Sacco and Dr. James H.
Starling, chairman of - the
biology department, place some
of the blame for the low accep-
tance rate on the new Medical
College Admissions Test
(MCAT).

The new comprehensive ex-
amination places more e hasis
on science rather than general
knowledge unlike the old test.

This year’s MCATs were also
a gruelling test of endurance,
lasting from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
with only an hour break for

_lunch, and one 10 minute break
in each testing session.

The Advisor, “the newsletter

for the National Association of
Advisors for the Health Profes-
sions,’ has come out strongly
against the new examinations,
urging that medical school ad-
missions officers take the dif-
ficulty of the new MCATs into
account with lower test scores.

“I feel I was definately
prepared,” said Sacco. ‘‘I have
just as good a background in
biological _ and’ chemical
sciences as students at any col-
lege throughout the nation.”’

Dr. Starling said that
Washington and Lee “has a
good reputation with medical
schools,”’ and pointed out that
the college national average for
acceptance to medical school is

“Little Mary Sunshine”

Will Cantler as ‘‘Cpl. ‘Billy’

want to rush up and wipe off his
nose and clean hisglasses. Very
convincing. Penni Westbrook as
‘‘Mary”’ handles the songs well
with her nice voice. She is also
saccharin enough for the
melodramatic satire and keeps
the audience’ laughing
throughout the play. Sage
Parker is charming in her role
as “Nancy,” and a pleasure to
watch on stage. She is very
pretty.

The play drags in parts,
especially when Rose Gordon is
on stage or when the ‘‘Young
ladies of Eastchester Finishing
School”’ are trying to dogpaddle
through an especially thick and

‘“‘yucky’’ song. Gordon has a |

very annoying lisp which is ir-
ritable to the audience. She

Austrian accent, but ruins the
effort by trying too hard to act.
She is not relaxed, and hence,

a delight.

The ‘Forest Rangers’ are
charming and the audience
eagerly awaits their every ap-
pearance on stage. Every time
they enter, the refrain from
“The Forest Ranger’ is sung. It
is quite humorous.

The delight of the night is
‘‘Jim Weatherstone’’ as
General Oscar Fairfax, an ag-
ing old buck who still has his
eyes on the young girls. His per-
formance alone makes the play
a worthwhile and enjoyable ex-
perience. Weatherstone is com-
pletely at ease with his
character and his voice is love-
ly. The audience is his before
the end of the play.

Though there are moments
when you feel you should get up
and leave, bits of humor
restrain you. As a whole, Little
Mary Sunshine, with its slightly
overused plot, has some in-
teresting underlying humor. If
you can stand molasses, the
final taste is sweet.

WE&L Class of 1978: A Senior Remembers

by Peter Keefe

One week from today com-
mencement exercises will be
held on the frown lawn of W&L
for the class of 1978.

Graduation contains the ele-
ment of.finality, and a greater
element of continuity than is
found at most other schools.

We leave behind us unique
condtions of existence that can’t
be duplicated anywhere —
roadtrips, grain parties, odd
musical tastes, beautiful moun-
tains, a particular slang, an ef-
fective honor system.

Simply stated, it seems in-
evitable that the way .we con-
duct our lives will change to a
degree greater than say, a

P Aitng-i0i0

VOLUME LXXVII

graduate from the University of
Maryland or the University of
Richmond.

At the same time, there is a
residue from one’s experience
at W&L that sticks longer and
in greater quantity than at
other schools. Alumni of W&L
traditionally are more concern-

ed about, and more generous, in’ —

maintaining the security of
their alma mater’s future.

Most of us eagerly await the
chance to go out irito society and
test ourselves, and indirectly
W&L, against the wiles of
mature life. And there are those
who understandably will stay
around Lexington; those who
feel that they have found a way

of life and a home here.

Always. at this time of year,
seniors tend to sacrifice a little
education reminiscing. They
talk about the people we have
met, and the spectacles we have
witnessed over the last four
years can continue well into the
early morning.

How many members of the
class of 1978 were present at

Homeland Field in Baltimore,

May 1975, when little W&L,

' seeded last in the NCAA tourna-

ment, soundly trounced number
one Johns Hopkins?

And speaking of lacrosse, the
bonfire in the Quad after the
victory over U.VA. freshman
year was made more notable

when one of our former
classmates chased one of the
deans with a burning broom
(one of the unintended
casualties of that blaze, along
with some furniture, was a term
paper that was accidentally. us-
ed for fuel before it had been
graded).

There was also the Fancy
Dress mudslide. Fancy Dress
Weekend 1975 was a rainy one,
creating perfect conditions. in
the Quad. The event developed
into a game of one-upmanship,
as ordinarly dressed participats
stepped aside first for an in-
dividual in ful formal dress,
and then for one who. wasn’t
dressed at all.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, MAY 19, 1978

Ceremony Next Week

300 Seniors, 70 Law Students Will Receive Degrees

Tucker’s Resignation Rejected
By An Indignant EC

by Randy Smith

Bill Tucker submitted his
resignation as chairman of the
Student Activities Board to the
Executive Committee Monday
night. The. EC declined
Tucker’s resignation, however,
by a vote of 2-6, forcing Tucker
to serve out the last week of his
term as SAB chairman.

Tucker tendered his resigna-
tion after a stormy confronta-
tion with EC members over fun-
ding of last week’s Glenn
Phillips concert in the Cockpit.

-At last week’s EC meeting, it
was recommended to Tucker
that tbe SAB pay the difference
in the band’s $800 price, ex-
pected to be about $200. (The
Music Union contributed $200,
the $1 cover-charge was ex-
pected to generate an additional
$300-400, and the Cockpit pro-
vided meals for the group. )

In return for SAB funding of
the band, the EC promised to
underwrite any unexpected ex-

penses charged to the SAB dur-
ing the summer.
“‘We don’t want to take money

out of the reserve fund to pay
for a band,” said EC vice- —

president George Griffin. The
purpose of the reserve fund is to
cover budget overruns of sub-
committees.

EC members were reluctant
to fund entertainment out of the

reserve account, prompting the
proposed exchange of fiscal
responsibility between the EC
and the SAB.

Tucker said that the decision
to make up the difference in
funding the Glenn Phillips band
would be up to his committee.

The Student Activities Board
decided against funding the

EC Honor Code Changes

by Neil Pentifallo

Secretary of the EC
The Executive Committee
has made several changes to
the White Book and reexamined
the procedures of honor trials
this year. The process took
several weeks, and significant

' revisions were passed as well as

several that cleared confusing
parts.

The examination and ques-
tioning of parts of the White
Book resulted from many law
students being concerned with
‘an accused person’s rights and
that a fair trial be ensured.

The Student Bar Association
set up a subcommittee to
review the White Book and sug-
gest changes to the Executive
Committee. The two law class
representatives were non-
voting members of the subcom-
mittee and explained the pro-

cedures of honor trials.

The most significant change
recommended by the subcom-
mittee was a form of graduated

’ penalty. They suggested that

the EC first decide if a student
is guilty, then set a time when
he may reapply to school if the
EC dediced he could return at
all. This was rejected by the
EC. The reasons given were
that a graduated penalty would
be a “‘buffer’” for students. The
law students were concerned
with the absolute penalty
because it is virtually impossi-
ble to transfer to another law
school if one were dismissed.

A change that the EC did pass
was limiting the area that the
EC has jurisdiction for honor of-
fenses. Previously, there were
no geographic boundaries to the
honor system. Now, it is more

Phonathon Nets $20,000

Twenty-eight Washington and -

Lee University students raised
approximately $20,000 from
alumni and parents for the
university’s Annual Fund dur-
ing a ‘‘phonathon’” conducted
under the auspices of the Stu-
dent Planning and Develop-
ment Committee this month.

During each of the three
nights of the phonathon,
students who raised the money
or the most pledges received
prizes, W&L beer mugs.

The prize winners were Harry
T. Jones III, a senior, and
William M. Webster, a junior,
during the first night; E. Hub-
bard Kennady III, a sophomore
who won in both categories the
second night; and Jerry M.
Baird, a senior, and Anthony A.
Carli Jr., a sophomore on the
final night.

Other student participants
were seniors John L. Bruch III,
Robert M. Couch, Walter
Granruth III, George F. Griffin
IV, Benjamin I. Johns, Philip J.
Kaplan, James S. MecNider III,
Marcus M. Pennell III, and

third-year law student Robert
G. Morecock.

Juniors who took part in the
effort were Andrew J. Archie,
R. E. Lee Davies, Frank R.
Ellerbe III, Douglas B. Lane, J.
Hagood S. Morrison, Stephen D.
Trigg, Peter M. Williams and
Thomas A. Wiseman III.

Sophomoies Daniel J. Weeks
and John T: Woods and
freshmen R. Christopher Gam-
mon, James G. Hurley Jr., and
Joseph Robles constituted the
rest of the group.

The money raised by the
group is for the Annual Fund,
which this year has a goal of
$775,000. The fund provides bet-
ween eight and ten percent of
Washington and Lee’s annual
operating budget, accounting
for approximately $450 per stu-
dent of the difference between
the cost of a student’s education
at W&L and the amount the stu-
dent actually pays in tuition.

The students worked for three
hours for each of the three
nights. Planning for the
phonathon began in early
January.

band, the cost of which
amounted to $136.

At Monday’s EC meeting,
Griffin said he was ‘“‘disap-
pointed”’ with the SAB’s deci-
sion. ‘‘We planned on spending
this $136 anyway,” he said.

Tucker said his committee
was reluctant to help pay for
entertainment not booked by
students.

“If that’s the SAB’s attitude
toward the Music Union and the
Cockpit, we might as well give
the Music Union $10,000 next
year,’’ snapped Jim Underhill,
president of the EC.

“T think it’s the job of the SAB
to provide entertainment for the
students not in fraternities and
you didn’t take responsibility
for that,’’ said sophomore
representative Steve Abraham.

Doug Perkins, senior EC
representative, made a motion
“to strip the SAB of their
funds.”’

Following Perkins’ motion,
discussion centered on the
assumption of the SAB’s sum-
mer debts.

The largest question mark in
the SAB’s budget is the salary
of the promotional advertising

/agent who was contracted to

help make arrangements for
the Harry Chapin concert. He

did not come to Lexington as .

promised.
Tucker was in the process of
negotiating the agent’s fee, but

several EC members felt thee

agent should not be paid.

To complicate the issue,
Tucker said the promotional
agency had ‘‘fulfilled their
obligations” to the written con-
tract, ‘“‘but not in the verbal con-
tract.’’ (It was verbally agreed
that the agent would come to
Lexington. )

“We’re not going to worry
about that $750 agent’s fee,”’
said Underhill.

“T really think it would be a
mistake to take this out of our
laps,’’ responded Tucker.

Underhill also expressed in-
dignation that Tucker could not
predict outstanding SAB bills.

“How can bills trickle in this
summer that you don’t even
know about?” he asked. “If
you can’t handle these things in
a good business-like manner,
we will take your money from
you. You are not making good
decisions for the SAB,”’
Underhill said.

Perkins’ motion to take the
$3,100 currently remaining in
the SAB’’s budget and assume
their debts and liabilities for the
summer was approved 7-1.
Freshman representative Chris
Gammon was the only EC
member to vote against the mo-
tion. Absent from Monday’s
meeting were Jackie Boyden,
Tom Healy, Mike Missal, and
Andy Bodenstab.

“The EC feels, considering
the amount left, that you did not
spend the SAB’s money wise-
ly,’ said Underhill after the
vote.

Tucker silently submitted his
resignation and left the
meeting. The EC voted to
decline his resignation.

In an interview after the
meeting, Tucker said, ‘‘I
thought Underhill’s com-

ment(after the vote to take
away the SAB’s money )-‘you’ve
been hosed’--was very ap-
propriate.”

On the SAB’s decision not to
help fund the Glenn Phillips
band, Tucker said, “‘The SAB
was tired of financing groups in
the Cockpit with money from
student body funds when a stu-
dent had not booked the band.”’

‘The EC has shown a tenden-
cy this year to meddle in the af-
fairs of their subcommittees,
mainly the SAB and the Pub.
Board,” Tucker said. ‘‘If thé EC
wants to run our financial af-
fairs, I see no reason to be the
chairman of that committee.”’

“T will not be a part of next
year’s EC if they prove to be as
lethargic and inept as_ this
year’s,”’ continued Tucker, who
is vice-president of next year’s
EC.

In reference to the running
keg of Miller beer the EC had
during their Monday meeting,
Tucker said, ‘‘I think it’s quite
appropriate that when I resign-,
ed, the EC was having a keg
party to improve relations bet-
ween itself *and its subcom-
mittees. If it takes an inebriated
student body government to get
along with its subcommittees
and perform its ‘legislative
responsibility, then something
is wrong.”’

Other business at Monday’s
EC meeting included year-end
committee reports.

The 1980 Mock Convention
Committee presented an itemiz-
ed budget of their expenses this
year.: Eighty people, primarily
freshmen and sophomores,
were reportedly signed up for
next year’s committee.

Parker Potter, editor of Ariel,
the student: literary magazine,
reported a successful year and
recommended that two issues

be printed next year. The latest .-

edition of the magazine was
made available Wednesday at
the library and the bookstore.

Contact committee reported
spending $11,670 of their $12,000
on five speakers this year. The
EC voted to appropriate, 60 per-
cent of the sum left in Contact’s
checking account (the percen-
tage of their contribution to the
organization at the beginning of
the year.)

The Cold Check Committee
reported that $541 in checks had
yet to be repaid by students.
Dick Schoenfeld, next year’s

w/1 Item 2.99
3 Items 3.79

committee chairman, said he
felt there was a good chance the
committee ‘could at least
break even’’ by the end of the
year.

This year’s chairman, An-
drew Sanders, said that many
merchants who usually do not
work with the Cold Check Com-
mittee had ‘‘dumped’”’ hundreds
of dollars worth of bad checks
on the committee las week.
“They waited until the last
minute, letting the checks ac-
cumulate,’’ he said.

Sanders also recommended
that the EC lend money to the
Student Emergency Loan Fund
next year. (Currently, the only
source of revenue for that
organization is fine money

given by Cold Check and Stu- ’

dent Control.)

Grant Leister, business
manager of the Calyx, gave an
itemized accounting of this
year’s expenditures in putting
out a yearbook.

His projected net budget
overrun for this year was $477.
Leister said this year’s book
had run $1,660 above budget,
but that more revenues had
been collected than budgetted.

Leister also noted that the
student tax only paid for $7.20 of
the cost for the $19 yearbooks.
He recommended that next
year’s Calyx receive more
money from the EC.

The Publications Board con-
troversy that has been wagedx
all spring was never fully
resolved; its resolution has
been left up to next year’s Ex-

ecutive Committee.
A recommendation was
made, however, that two

students serve as_ voting
members on future Pub. Boards
to provide more student input in
that organization.

“‘T hope you (the Pub. Board)
will take the initiative to see
this thing through next year,”
said Underhill.

Despite the relatively sparse
student attendance at the
meeting, the entire keg of beer
was eventually consumed.

ENTERTAINMENT
“Saturday Night” saves Ariel

 

by Amy Herring

Sympathy to Parker Potter!
If some of the work published in
the Winter-Spring edition of the
ariel is any indication of what
Potter had to read as editor of
the W&L literary magazine, he
must be a truly dedicated in-
dividual.

Those interested in reading
ariel, don’t let my words
dissuade you in any way: the
opening quote fromThe
Tempest is remarkably ac-
cuarate in its description of the
need for a bit of artistic inter-
ruption during the university's
Bacchanalian short term.

It is truly unfortunate that the
magazine begins with what is
probably the weakest effort in
the entire ariel, Mark Mendel’s
short story ‘It All Looks Dif-
ferent in the Morning.” Aside
from saying the story is truly
bad, there is very little that can
even warrant comment. In
deference to Mendel’s true need
for constructive criticism, I will
at least note that ‘I kissed her
lightly on the temple and climb-
ed out of the bed, ready to greet
the new day”’ is an incredibly
trite way to end the story. At
least the author was consistent.

Michael. Brown’s contribu-

 

tion, ‘‘The Stagehand,”’
represents a true improvement
over Mendel’s atrocity. Brown
evidently has been studying
John Gardner or perhaps one of
the numerous new American
authors who are imitating him
now. Brown attempts a ‘“Gard-
neresque’’ mystical surprise
story and succeeds to an ad-
mirable extent. Unfortunately,
instead of allowing his reader to
draw his own conclusion about
the Edenic existence of the
company, he places these con-
clusions in the words of his
main character. Even readers
like to think at times and allow-
ing them to reach their own
decision would have created a
greater interest in the plot.
Keep it up Mr. Brown: you've
got a lot going for you!
“Sometimes Even Old
Friends Can't Save Saturday
Night’’ by James Leva _ is
delightful and easily the best
piece in this edition of the ariel.
In fact, the effort required to ob-
tain the magazine may well be
deserved by this one story
alone. Leva’s use of classical
and historical reference is
nothing short of excellent in this
whimsical, but  thought-
provoking, adventure into hell.
Many think that hell might be

infinitely more interesting than
heaven. Leva has gone a long
way toward making this a
foregone conclusion.

Jim Feinman’s ‘“‘The Last
Cast’’ will undoubtedly have ap-
peal to the sportsman at W&L.
Although it lacks some of the in-
terest of Ben Keesee’s contibu-
tion to this sports- story genre in
the last edition of theariel, the
story shows Feinman to have
definite skill in description and
a genuine hold on reality- crea-
tion. I really felt that this story
could actually have taken
place. The ending is somewhat
trite and could have been im-
proved if the author’s ability in
the rest of the piece is any in-
dication. But like Michael
Brown, Jim Feinman should not
lay down his pen yet.

The poetry of the ariel is what
could have been expected in a
college literary magazine: a
whole bunch of very free and
not-so-great free verse and a
couple of things which show the
beginnings of ability on the part
of the poet. Only one true irrita-
tion: I have never claimed to be
a scholar and I generally get
very upset at editors who do not
translate Latin phrases for the

With the release of his eighth
solo album, Roy Buchanan reaf-
firms his place among the
world’s top guitarists. You're
Not Alone has a very different
sound from previous Buchanan
works, though, moving
somewhat away from blues and
more into straight rock and
(almost) space rock. The begin-
ning of ‘‘Fly...Night Bird’’, for
example, could be an outtake
from Pink Floyd’s Wish You
Were Here recording sessions.

You’re Not Alone opens up
with a totally uncharacteristic
keyboard piece, leading into the
powerful ‘Turn to Stone,” writ-
ten by Joe Walsh and easily the
best tract on the album. Oddly
enough (sine most of the
material is original), the
record’s worst song was also
written by someone outside the
band — in this case Neil Young.
Buchanan should never have
touched Young's classic ‘‘Down
by the River,’’ and his remake
just can’t compare with the
original. With the exception of
this one low point, however,
You're Not Alone represents a

new and welcome progression

for Roy Buchanan.

‘Pure Pop for Now People”’
Columbia
’’Pure Pop for Now People’’ is
the first solo outing by Nick
Lowé,., the. founder of Stiff

ee Pi htc Lia wits ot be it

Records, who has produced and

played behind such people as”

Graham Parker and Elvis
Costello. The front cover of this
album, which.features six
photographs of Nick ina variety
of costumes ranging from a
John Sebastian-ish flower child,
circa 1968, to a recent reject by
CBGB’s, is quite representative
of what.is to be found inside.
The music itself is a spotty
misture of bizarre satire and oc-
casionally billiant pop craft-
manship. These two diverse
elements come together most
coherently in ‘‘Marie Provost,”
a lament to an up-and-coming
star whose career was
prematurely ended when she
was devoured by her pet
dachshund. Other standouts in-
clude ‘(I Love the.Sound of)
Breaking Glass,” a curious
send-up of the New Wave's fee-
ble dabblings in reggae, and

‘‘Roller’s Show,”’ a bitterly sar-
castic ode to teenage mania.

Of course, there are times
when Lowe’s finely tuned
satirical sense deteriorates into
simplistic redundancy. ‘‘Music
for Money’”’ and ‘‘They Called It
Rock’’ in particular come
across as little more than exer-
cises in beating dead dogs.
Despite these minor flaws, the
album as a whole succeeds
remarkably well, especially
considering the ambitious
nature of its subject matter.
‘Pure Pop for Now People’
stands as a fine testament to the
brilliance of Nick Lowe who, on
the basis of this record, appears
to have a much greater chance
of becoming a seminal figure in
rock’n’roll than any of his
celebrated victims.

See you next year.

Glenn Phillips appeared in Pit last weekend.

In Your Pit —

by Randy Smith

High quality rock entertain-
ment appeared in the Cockpit
this past weekend.

The Glenn Phillips band was,
without a doubt, the best group
to have performed in
Washington and Lee’s tavern
this year’ and rivals the recent
Harry Chapin concert for solid
performance.

Glenn Phillips mesmerized
an enthusiastic crowd of over
400 people Friday and Saturday
night. Many sat through all six
sets of their sharp, crisp play.

Phillips is a classic lead
guitarist, rivaling Jeff Beck in
style and ability; he also staged
an incredible acrobatic show in
his dirty red sneakers.

X

The bass player, ‘‘The
dynamic Bill Ray,” is another
classic performer; the typical
disinterested-looking bass
player — unfazed by it all.

Twenty-nine-year-old Doug
Lansberg on drums and
keyboard man David Wilson
rounded out the group’s strong
show of hard and fast rock. The
only thing lacking was vocals,
but that did not detract from the
quality of the performance.

Dan Scott should be given
much credit for the Glenn
Phillips coup. It was his in-
itiative that brought them all
the way up from Atlanta.

The SAB should keep this
band in mind for next October’s
Homecoming weekend concert.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

» My Struggle
te

© It has been a long and hard year, but fruitful. Many things have
a been said, much dust has been stirred up, many things have been
° accomplished. First, in the opinion of the Ring-tum Phi staff, the

school newspaper has finally become a school newspaper. In the
past, the editors have been afraid to report the news as it happened,
or even to report the news at all. A newspaper should report all the
news and not be afraid of public opinion. Much of the news tends to
offend the public, but a newspaper’s responsibility is to keep the
public informed. People have been offended this year, but it was in
service to the student body.

One of the problems with the old Ring-tum Phi was that it was
never read by the student body. It was full of News Office press
releases, not news discovered by Phi staff reporters. Press
releases were used this year, but only as filler, not as a main source
of news. As is true in any situation, there is plenty of news in the
world, it just takes a conscientious reporter to sniff it out. The
1977-78 Ring-tum Phi was fortunate to have a staff of reporters will-
ing to stick their noses into other people’s business and make it
their business. Consequently, the staff was able to fill twelve pages
most weeks, and even on one occasion sixteen pages.

But it was not easy. The news staff had to contend with a business
manager who was concerned with making the Ring-tum Phi a huge
monetary success. If the Phi was privately owned, then it would be
the objective of the paper to maké a profit. But the objective of the
Washington and Lee newspaper should be to put out the best, most
informative, and entertaining product for the student body. In do-
ing so the paper will be read and the merchants will want to adver-
tise. If a paper is 60-70 percent ads, the readers will not find much
interest in its pages. The Ring-tum Phi did not make a profit this
year. The editor did not get paid a salary. The editor did not want
one. The editor got what he wanted — twelve pages of news. More
news than the student body has seen before. The Publications
Board backed the Phi news staff in its dispute with the business
manager. For this, the news staff is grateful. Maybe next year the
business manager will get the profit he desires. In the best interests
of the paper, I hope not.

Yes, the paper was read this year. There were many reasons for

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

   

this. The news was divided into sections. The different bits of news
need to be grouped together for the convenience of the reader and
relation to the other news. Some of the headlines of the stories were
sensational. But then, some of the news was sensational also. The
editorials were inciting, provocative, and even infuriating at times.
An editorial should provoke thought. This year’s editorials said
things that have not been said before and needed to be said.

The Student Activities Board was attacked this year because
students have been unsatisfied with. the Board’s past per-
formances. Rumors had been flying around for two years about
money stolen and corruption among the co-chairmen. Individual
members had been willing to talk in the past, but the Phi had been
unwilling to print what they had to say. More things were un-
covered than were printed this year for lack of strong evidence.
The SAB was the committee most in need of the paper breathing
down its back. In the past, bands were booked in secret, records
were not kept, there was no account of how student money was be-
ing spent. In essence, the student body was not being fairly
represented by the SAB. A small segment of thought was year after
year controlling the SAB and making all the decisions. The SAB
refused to listen to the student opinion collected. by the SAB itself
because it didn’t reflect the musical tastes held by the committee.
The only way to bring an end to such injustice was to expose the
corruption to the public and dig deep for all the dirt that could be
found. The news staff did not have to dig too deep in the SAB’s case.

Contact was discovered to have been acting along the same lines

_ of the SAB. It too is a committee which is almost self-perpetuating
with Phi Kap and SAE people getting the co-chairmenships year
after year. Contact has been known to make closed door decisions
concerning speakers. The co-chairmen do not include the other
Contact members in decisions about which speakers to get. The Phi
would have reported more on Contact, but the co-chairmen knew
what was going on, and they weren’t talking.

The Ring-tum Phi led the crusade for open meetings to combat
the injustice that existed within the SAB and Contact. The students
have the right to know what is going on behind those closed doors.
The people who make up the committees are not an elite group and
should not consider themselves so. They need to be open to input
from the student body and students should have the opportunity to
scrutinize their representatives’ performance. As has been said in
the past, if the committees are doing a good job, then they should
want to let students know about it.

The 1977-78 Ring-tum Phi is against using student money to fund
EC subcommittee parties. Next year’s Phi will not be. Students
who participate in student activities and on student committees
should not expect a reward for doing so. The reward should be in

doing the job. It is a shame that the people who serve on these com-
mittees do not think so. Stud&nts do not pay their activities fee to
fund parties for public servants.

Because Washington and Lee is not set alone in this world, the
Phi chose to do some reporting on the city of Lexington. For years,
the students have had complaints about the town and vice versa. In
the past, editors had decided a “hands off’’ policy was the best ap-
proach to the problem. The.problem, never being approached by
the students, was never approached by the city. Noise ballooned in-
to a major problem. The press’s right to public information became
another issue. The first problem was shelved, the second was settl-
ed in the press’s favor. Problems still exist, but the town now knows
the students are a force to be reckoned with.

The news staff decided to investigate W&L’s stock portfolio
because certain industries support South Africa’s apartheid policy.
Apartheid is inhuman and even though W&L has southern conser-
vative tendencies, that is no reason to support South Africa’s racist
policies. . Other universities in the nation demanded explanations
from their schools’ administrations. The Ring-tum Phi felt the
WA&L student body should receive one also

The Charlie Hulfish affair was very sad. Hulfish should have left
student politics after his loan controversy arose at the
beginning of the year. The Ring-tum Phi chose to report that
Hulfish committed an honor violation when he refused to abide by
the system. The news staff felt is presence on campus was an in-
sult to every student for whom the honor system means something.
The Phi broke precedent by printing the results of an honor trial,
but the staff felt the precedent-setting action to be in the best in-
terests of the student body. Hulfish was continuing to use the stu-
dent body for his own dessef*. An honor felon should be ostracized
by the student body. The EC is supposed to do this. In failing to act,
the EC was not fulfilling its duty to the student body. In reporting
the Hulfish honor offense, the irresponsibility of the student govern-
ment and the corruption of a public official who handled student
money was brought to light. :

This was the first year in recent history that the newspaper gave
more than PR coverage to the student body elections. In the past,
only the individual candidates’ personal statements were printed.
The:Phi had been unwilling to approach the issues, as: the can-
didates were unwilling to approach the issues. This yea. the can-
didatés were presented the issues and were compelled to comment
on.them. The student body should be informed as to the candidates’
feelings about all the issues. It is a newspaper’s responsibility to in-
form the student body about the issues and how the candidates feel
about them. My hope is that future editors will attempt to require
more than statements from the candidates.

ontact, SAB ia Trouble

The editorial position has perhaps received most of the criticism
this year. It should. Students should be applauded for caring
enough to write in. No letter has been suppressed this year.
Criticism has been invited and appreciated. Though most of the
critics have attacked the position the editor has taken, the staff has
made it a policy to print every letter, and to give preference to let-
ters criticizing over those that have praised.

From the first editorial damning the rush season to the last
editorial praising the E.C., the intention was to provoke thought.
Thought has been provoked. In some cases, action has been taken
to right wrongs. Many things still need to be done to make
Washington and Lee become closer to a utopia.

Rush is held too soon in the year and the freshmen needs are not
the primary concern of the IFC. Frats are out to meet their quotas.
The rush editorial was intended to tell the freshmen to keep their
eyes open to the true nature of rush. Whether this editorial was suc-
cessful should be a question left to the rising sophomores.

' People had been thinking it for years but everyone was afraid to
say it. The football team had real problems. Usually, a sports
editorial is not included in the editorial section, but rather in the
sports section. The editor felt since sports is such an integral part of
the life at W&L, it had a place on the editorial page. The editorial
came as close as it could without saying it — the football team need-

Ring-tum Phi, May 19, 1978, Page 5
Review and Outlook reprimanded the law school for wanting to

break away from the honor system and form their own. Enough
division exists already between the two student bodies. The Phi felt
the law school should try to bridge the gap, rather than widen it. .
Student rights became a big issue when it was discovered just
what some of Student Control’s procedures were. The committee
was basically a very efficient one which overstepped its boundaries
many times. Students inside Washington and Lee should have the
same rights as students on the outside. The Phi pointed out the in-
justice of the system and demanded changes that would be in the
best interest of the student body. Never was the Phi interested in
judging any one member of SCC. The purpose was to change the
system. .
The next week, the E.C. had to be criticized for not demanding
that SAC change SCC procedure. It was another sign of E.C. inac-

tion that could not be allowed to go unnoticed.

None of the other editorials are worth mentioning. The editorials
set out to get things done. Sometimes they succeeded, other times
they didn’t. On the whole, the news staff is pleased with the

resulting outcome from its editorials.

Finally, I must approach the subject of the Rank-tam Poon. It s
follows with another objective which the staff was supposed to

strive for this year. The writers were supposed to have fun at all

Now the mean old Grinch was as delighted as could be,
and he told himself so, as he slapped his own knee,

Then the Grinch sat down, and with a couple of wheezes,

With a couple of beiches and a couple of sneezes,

He took out the calendar, a pair of scissors and turned,

To the week of the first, and then his heart yearned,

To cut out Saturday, and cut, cut he did.

He cut and he snipped and he snipped and he cut and before long,
Why even before the Lee Chapel clock struck an early morning

Before the sun rose high in the dawn,
Saturday, sweet Saturday, was gone.

Way down in Mink-ville lives a special breed of evil;

. . Saturday-stealing grinches who eat little finches.
But also in Mink-ville live the minks who are good,
They goto school during the week, like all students should.
On Sunday, it’s Sunday-school. On Monday, it's Monday-school.
On Tuesday it's Tuesday-school and on Wednesday it's Wednesday-
school. On Thursday it's J-school and even on Friday, it's C-school
But Saturdays, sweet Saturdays are to each and every mink,
No-school days, and so they rightly think!
To the minks, school on Saturday is not so very funny,
They'd miss sleeping, and minking, and even Bugs Bunny

Now the minks took this seriously, as serious as could be.

They looked under rocks, they looked behind clocks.

They looked everywhere where iookers would look,

And the answer was found in a history book!

The period of the sixties was where the answer was found.
When the children were vocal and sat on the ground

But minks are never vocal, people would misconstrue,
Minks only thirst. and do what minks do

Amidst the confusion, a speaker arose,

and opened his mouth and said on his toes.

We'll do as minks do, and stay home and sleep.”

Tradition continues to remain an important aspect of this fine old
institution. A prime example of this 1s the football team’s tradition
of losing The student body has come to expect a nonwinning
season, From the football team and trom the team’s showing in the
first three games. it looks like we won't be disappointed

The team has not really looked bad In-fact. the offense has im
proved since last year, and the defense has been steadily improving
this year. Against Lock Haven State, no matter how corny it
sounds, it seemed as if the time really diu run out on the Generals
We were definitely outclassed against Davidson, to the point that
they should never have been scheduled. Though these two games
were host, we really can't feel too upset about them The team
played as well as could be expected under the circumstances

What we can be upset about is the loss of the last game to Centre
College The Generals played well for most of the game. perhaps
the best they have played all year Then finding themselves behind
by one point with three minutes to go. they gave the game away
under the direction of the coaching staff, Why the coaches elected
to put in a freshman quarterback to run the option play when the
outcome of the game was still undecided is a perturbing question

No matter how good a runner Leiser is. and this 1s not to take
anything away from him, a freshman backup QB whose only play
ing experience this year has been as a running back. should not
have been given the job of directing the offense at such a crucial
time There is just too much pressure in a situation like that to put
upon his shoulders. But even more importantly, a passing strategy

was called for, and our team sources have said that Letser is just
not competent in this area

The second string QB Scott Swope is supposed to be a competent
Passer. Swope is a junior, who. if not anything else, has two more
years of maturity than a freshman. Granted. Swope does not have
much play time experience ‘and we question this due to this year's
record), but he is a passer and a passer was needed in this par-
ticular situation We are not suggesting that the game would
definitely have been won had Swope been put in immediately after
Hissey's injury, but our chances almost undoubediy would have
been increased The coaches did put Swope in te do what Leiser
couldn't, but there were only 29 seconds left on the clock

This indecision and misdecision is reminiscent of the 1975 Centre
College game when after being behind 9-4. the Generals scored with
seconds remaining on the clock, and the coaches elected to try out
their two point conversion play instead of going for the almost sure

win by kicking the extra point’ Another case is last year at
Hampden-Sydney when coaching indecision concerning what was
going. on on the field when a field goal was obviously ealled for and
the coaches’s lack of concentration led toa delay of game penalty,
which resulted in a short field goal attempt

The coaching staff has been out to lunch. There is no coordination
and communication between the couches Indecision is com
monplace, not rare It appears that the team has no coaching
leadership, as evidenced by the above games which resulted in not
ches for the lost column The head couch ts suppesed io make the
important decisions when they need to be made. net just concern
himself with the detensive backticld Coaeh McHenry, where are
you when you are needed”

The team has the potential to have a winning season this year
But we wonder whether tradition will be broken unless some

leadership decisions or changes are made IMG

Tennis Team Finishes

Second in Nation

by Mike Farrand
Washington and Lee’s tennis
team is now the school’s highest
nationally ranked team. Last

week in Ohio it battled other

Division III schools, competed
intensely, and returned the na-
tion’s number two team. Tennis
USA might have forecast a dif-
ferent result, as they had rank-
ed W&L number ‘1, but no one
was too disappointed. Indeed if
one asks Doug Gaker, who
played in the tournament, why
they finished only second he
retorts, ‘‘Why don’t you ask us
why we didn’t finish fifth or
sixth? That’s how it would
have been if we had played each
team head-to-head; tho teams
were that good.”

The same response comes
from the coach. Dennis Bussard
said: “I’m pleased. We all
played beyond our potential. We
didn't get one of the better
draws either.’’ Ben Johns, as an
indication, lost in the semi-
finals but had to beat the
number one seeded player, who

had not lost a match all year, to °

‘ get there. Johns only lost to
Alexanderson from Claremont
6-3, 6-7 (2-5), 6-4. Cody Davis
also played well, winning the
most crucial point for the
Generals. That was in the first
round against Claremont’s
number 4 man, Werner. He beat
him 7-5, 5-7, 6-4. If he had lost,
the Generals would have come
in third because Claremont
placed third only a point behind
W&L. Davis lost in the next
round 6-0, 6-3, to Bussert who
went on to become the national
champion.

The Johns-Jackson doubles
team, that won the title last
year, placed second this year,
losing to Kalamazoo’s Hosner-
Bussert in the finals. Says

 

Gondoliers
Win! !!!

The Ring-tum Phi
Muckrakers were defeated
14-10 by the WLUR Gondoliers.
The game took place last Fri-
day. The Muckrakers have
demanded a rematch to be held
today at3p.m.

The Gondoliers had practiced
several times before the Friday
match. The Muckrakers took
the field inexperienced. Yet, the
Muckrakers held a 10-4 ad-
vantage going into the sixth inn-
ing. A flurry of hits placed the
Gondoliers in the lead to stay.

 

 

 

Bussard, “They could have
played better but Kalamazoo
won the tournament and that
doubles team was as good as the
team.” Kalamazoo who had 20
victory points while W&L
followed with 12, ‘‘The tourna-
ment has never been dominated
like Kalamazoo did this year,”
states Bussard.

Reflecting on this year’s ten-
nis, Bussard is justifiably pleas-
ed. ‘We always say on this
team that if you play up to your
potential you can live with
yourself, and this team played
beyond their potential at times
and we are all finding it easy to
do just that,’’ sates the coach
about the success of this year.
‘We played a tough schedule
(75 percent Division I teams)
this year but we did well. Our
overall record, in fact, was
10-12.” He explained that the
schedule paid large dividends
at the national tournament.

The team had some bright
stars. ‘‘I’d say Gaker and Con-
stine are the most improved
players on the team,”’ he says,
“Doug changed his game to a
serve-and-volley and _ that
helped it immensely. David
Constine, too, raised the level of
his game considerably.’’ The
top three players, Johns,
Jackson and David, all played
well but nobody expected them
not to.

It looks as though tennis ex-
cellence is in Lexington to stay,
too. Ben Johns graduates this
year and Cody Davis is
transferring to Vanderbilt, but
many more great players will
be stepping in their places. In-
deed Bussard has labelled this
year ‘‘the greatest recruitment
year in Washington & Lee’s
history.’’ One recruit may be
the best tennis player to ever
come to this school. That honor
goes to Shaw Cranfield from
Houston, Texas. He is_ the
number 10 state player in the
eighteen and under category,
and was U. Va.’s number 1 pro-

spect for this year, but he chose.

WA&L for its size. Others include
John Daniel of Tulsa’
Oklahoma, who’s brother plays
number 1 for Duke, Tim Baird
who plays number 3 on the
number 1 school team in Texas,
and Weston Yonge. Richard
Makepeace also returns next
year to round out what should
be W&L’s most successful ten-
nis team ever.

For Coach Dennis Bussard,
who goes to Boston next year as
the basketball coach for Bab-
son, Washington and Lee has
only great appreciation for a
coaching jobwell done: :

 

W&L Lacrosse — What
Does the Future hold?

By Jim Barnes

After 12 goals and 12 strains of
‘““Give My Regards to
Broawdway”’, the adopted fight
song of Cornell University, one
senior paused to reflect on the
future of lacrosse at
Washington and Lee. In four
years and many Saturdays
spent at Wilson Field, he had
seen W&L drop from being fifth
ranked nationally, to slipping
into the playoffs as the ninth
nationally-ranked team at the
end of the regular season. For
the two years prior to this
senior’s tenure, the final season
polls recognized W&L as the
third be-st Division I team in
the country.

For the lacrosse team 1978
was a year of unfortunate

f 1 ane Oi es

““firsts’’. It was the first time in
five years that the team lost to
the University of Virginia. It
was the first time in seven and
nine years that we were
defeated by Duke and Roanoke
College respectively.

The question is, can W&L
realistically entertain ideas of
capturing a national champion-
ship amidst the growing
popularity of lacrosse among
Division I schools?

W&L’s head lacrosse coach
Jack Emmer is faced with the
unenviable task of trying to sell
W&L’s ‘“‘charms’’ to prospec-
tive recruits, while Johns
Hopkins and Maryland are han-
ding out scholarships. Only Cor-
nell bound by Ivy League
restrictions has a similar con-
straints placed on them. Even
then, Cornell can provide their
deserving players financial aid
on the basis of grants alone,
while W&L more often than not,
disributes its financial aid in a
composite form of grant, loan,
and work-study.

In pondering the above facts
one may wonder if W&L’s lac-
rosse team will ever regain the
prominance it once held in 1973
and 1974.

But perhaps the postmortems

are a bit premature. As one
senior said before the quater-
final contest in Ithica two
Wednesdays ago, ‘‘We’re only
three games away from the na-
tional championship.”

It was an achievement that
Washington and Lee was on the
game’s program cover. Not
many coaches could guide their

team to post season competition ~

having lost ten starters to
graduation and early season
defections. But Emmer, a
three-time lacrosse Coach-of-
the-Year, did not dwell on his
team’s depleted condition. In-
stead he took a team to the
playoffs that he admits ‘‘from
an ability standpoint, was the
weakest’”’ he has coached at

It is interesting to compare
W&L’s last two losses to the
Redmen of Cornell, both in first
round playoff competition. In
1976 the Generals were shut-out
14-0. This year the team scored
twice, and shaved Cornell’s
margin of victory to ten.

Both the ’76 and ’78 Cornell
teams had six All-Americans
starting for them. The ‘78
Redmen squad might be better
than the ’76 team starting seven

seniors and three juniors, all

veterans of the two previous
championship seasons.

On the other hand the °78
W&L unit was missing the ser-
vices of two °76 All-American
defensemen and the substan-
tially more potent ‘76 offense.
Although the Generals were
out-gunned by Cornell, they
were not outfought, as the team
displayed some of the most
ferocious checking ever
witnessed by a W&L fan.

Perhaps there is a goal for
some lacrosse players that is
equal to, or at the very least, a
close second behind winning a

national championship. That —

goal might be to play for a

 
   

nonathletic scholarship, small,
primarily division III school, to
compete with the division I
powers and their scholarships,
and beat them. That spirit, that
“‘etan'’, wil
characterize a W&L lacro-sse
team. With it, and the backing
of some of the nation’s most en-
thusiastic and loyal lacrosse
fans, the climb back to the top is
not impossible, but inevitable.

Fallon Holds Spring
Drills for Football

Washington and Lee’s new
football coach, Jack Fallon,
recently held a series offlex-
ibMty and agility workouts for
anyone “interested inworking
up a big sweat in a hurry.”
While all students were
welcome to attend, the majority
of the students were foot-
ballplayers, which impressed
Fallon.

Washington and Lee is a Divi-
sion III school, and according to
Division III regulations, no
member schooi can hold a spr-
ingfootball practice. The princi-
ple reason for the rule is the

high cost of football practice,

which requires insurance for
each player.

Fallon said he would like to
see the rule changed to permit
non-contact drills during the
spring. Football is the only ma-
jor sport that does not have off-
season practice at W&L. ‘‘The
type of athlete we get here
would benefit from a week of
work on technique and skills,”’
Fallon said. The players would
also have a reduced chance of
injury during the season with
improved priming and techni-
que.

Letters To The Editor

Dear Editor:

I learn from friends that this
edition of the Ring-tum Phi is
the last issue with you, Mr.
Gallagher, as the editor.

At this time then, I would like
to be counted among those who
are sad to see your term end. I
feel that this year you have
served well as editor. The

We might also recall the
freshman who was chained to
the bicycle rack in the Quad and
his subsequent rage. The Class
of ‘78 undoubtedly brought
more life and rowdiness with
them to the freshman dorms
than any class in_ recent
memory. The memories are
good and numerous.

Most of us have worked hard
and played hard. The percen-
tage of five-year men is not any
higher than in classes
preceding ours.

As in the past, many of us will
continue our education at some
of the finest graduate. and pro-
fessional schools here and
abroad. Then again, there are
those of us who will rise no
higher in occupational status
than the W&L alumnus who
runs the Ferris Wheel on Coney
Island.

So we leave Washington and
Lee. For most, it has been a
good four years that hopefully
will serve us well in the future.

We will receive on Thursday,
a sheepskin (or a receipt for
$25,000) that reflects the condi-
tioning and education of one of
the country’s strong academic
institutions. Whether we
employ it to take us to positions
of leadership or to the Ferris
Wheel at Coney Island, few will
claim that they acquired it
while simply marking time.

Honor Code Changes

(continued from page 1)

realistically reflected by giving
the EC jurisdiction in “Lex-
ington, Rockbridge County, or
whenever a student represents
himself as being a student at
Washington and Lee. Hence,
there may be many things
reprehensible and heartily con-
demned by the EC and all good
citizens which still cannot be
brought under the honor
system.”’

Another change was _in-
stituted that requires that a stu-
dent found guilty in an EC hear-
ing, and not appealing his case
. must leave within 48 hours. The
President of the EC may extend
this time period. There had not
been any time limit before. This
presented problems when a stu-
dent found guilty but not ap-

pealing the EC verdict to a stu-*

dent body hearing would re-
main around campus. The pro-
vision also delineates respon-
sibility,. saying that the ad-
ministration is responsible for
the student’s removal.

The advisors are also now
able to question any witnesses
that appear before the EC. The
accused was the only one able to
ask questions of the witnesses
before, with the result that ad-
visors to the accused would
whisper questions to the accus-
ed, and he in turn would repeat
the questions out loud to the
witnesses. Several EC
members felt that advisors may
be able to intimidate witnesses,
but it was agreed to try the
change and see if it works.

There will be more student
representation in the initial in-
vestigations into possible
breaches of the honor system.
Before,
would investigate a possible
violation, and two of the three
had to decide to bring the mat-
ter to the attention of the full
EC. Now, there will be two EC
members and a student from
the same school within the
university as that of the
suspected student.

The accused may also know
the identity of all adverse
witnesses at the time that he is
charged with an honor viola-
tion. Previously, the accused
was not told what witnesses
would be testifying against him.
There is a provision included,
however, if the accused tries to
intimidate the adverse
witnesses. It reads that the E.C.
“will view such actions un-
favorable to the accused ‘‘

The time that it takes to
prepare for a student body
hearing should be shortened
with another provision. It was
accepted practice for the tape
recording of an EC hearing to
be transcribed in preparation
for a student body hearing. The
White Book limits such

transcripts for case prepara-
tion, however, so the EC hear-
ing cannot be replayed at a stu-
dent body hearing. The EC has
decided that this accepted prac-
tice is not to the advantage of
the EC nor the accused. The
tape can be played for the ac-
cused and the EC with both tak-
ing notes from it. This process
usually took a day or two and
has now been eliminated.
Another change enables a stu-
dent found guilty at either the
EC hearing or student body
hearing to have his transcript
sent to other schools without
any notations’ made about his
being found guilty of an honor

‘violation. The provision states

that a university record shall be
kept of students found guilty. If
a student withdraws after being
charged but before an honor
hearing, his university record
shall make a note of it. The
university record is thus
separate from an academic
transcript sent to other schools.

There were a total of fifteen
changes made to the White
Book. The other ten changes
cleared the wording or in-
stituted accepted practice into
the White Book. Overall, the
emphasis was on the rights of
the accused without becoming
preoccupited with the  pro-
cedural aspects of the honor
system.

Another result of law students
questioning parts of the pro-
cedures is that there will be an
orientation to the honor system
for the first year law students
this fall. In the last few years
there has not been one, but
plans are being made by the
new EC to do this.

Webster Wins

William M. Webster IV of
Greenville, S.C. has been nam-
ed the recipient of the G.
Holbrook Barber Honor
Scholarship at Washington and
Lee University here, where he
will be a senior next year.

The Barber’ Scholarship,
established last year by Mrs.
Barber in honor of the memory
of her late husband, is awarded
to the undergraduate senior at
W&L who has “made the
greatest contribution to the
spirit of the campus and univer-
sity life,’ taking into account
participation in university ac-
tivities, helpfulness toward

had this to say, ‘‘The pressure
was just getting to be too much.
I couldn’t take it any longer. A
person can take only so much
personal abuse and criticism. I
am a nervous wreck now. I can
hardly study for my exams.”’

Washington Hall was secretly
overjoyed when the news was
released on the wire services. A
source inside the Hall told the
RTP, ‘Gallagher has been a
thorn in our side all year. Good
riddance I say.”’

The official Washington Hall
statement was more favorable
towards Gallagher. “‘It is the
wish of Washington and Lee the
Mr. Gallagher will devote as
much time to his studies next
year as he has to the newspaper
so he can graduate from this in-
stitution. His contribution to the
paper has been quite un-
forgetable.”’

M. Gray Coleman has been
chosen by the Publications
Board to fill the editor position
next year. Coleman has been
noticably absent from the paper
the last few weeks though hav-
ing served as Entertainment
Editor earlier in the year.

He was inducted this winter
into membership in Omicron
Delta Kappa, the national
honorary leadership society
which was founded at
Washington and Lee in 1914. He
was one of only five juniors tap-
ped for membership.

The Holbrook Barber
Scholarship is awarded by a
special committee consisting of
the dean of The College, W&L’s
liberal arts and sciences divi-
sion, and two student represen-
tatives designated by the presi-

Ariel review

(continued from page 3)

generally illiterate reader such
as I. Granted Chip Rush has
every right as an artist to in-
troduce ‘‘Squadron--Love’’ with
an untranslated ode from
Horace. Parker Potter as editor
should have been more sym-
pathetic to his readers and
should have included an
English translation. Even*my
Milton edition has footnotes!

I like e.e. cummings and so I
guess I am prejudiced. Mike
Odom’s poem “Leaving Lex-
ington” had great appeal for
me. Short, sweet, and almost
unpunctuated, I loved it. But
then I am known for my ques-
tionable taste.

Chris Volk’s picture tour of
Europe was a welcome and at-
tractive addition to the ariel. I
am surprised, however, that he
was the only photographer or
visual artist featured. This
should be corrected in future

_ editions. I am no photography
critic, but why did I keep expec-

ting Mrs. Volk Sr. to be standing
there, waving to me from the
Eiffel Tower? I must have
problems--the family album on
the brain.

Parker Potter did a good, but
not a great job as editor. A few
of the pieces were simply not of
the quality required for even a
college magazine, but perhaps,
Potter did not have a large
selection of work from which to
choose. There were typos,
anathema I think in a publica-
tion such as this. In a few places
the layout was extremely poor,
something which should be
looked to in future ariels.
