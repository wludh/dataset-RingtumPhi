University
hires ombuds

Adrninstration welcomes
a new addition to provide »

consultation and mediation

By Eleanor Kennedy
STAFF WRITER

» Washington & Lee just added another mem-
ber to its administration, Jane Ellen Reid, the new
University Ombuds. According the University web
site, Reid’s duties will be to mediate work-related
conﬂicts, issues and other on-campus concerns. A
seven-person team of faculty and staff appointed by
President Ruscio recommended the creation of the
position after discussions with faculty at W&L and’
at other universities. jl '

The web site lists the duties of the ombuds as
“providing impartial, Cxnﬁdential consultation to
all employees, helping .-iIployees and supervisors
resolve conﬂicts, teaching skills for dispute resolu-
tion, providing mediation, and helping employees
understand and interpret policies and procedures.”

“As an ombuds, I relish the oppor-
tunity to work with parties, to help
them discover their own capacity
to address diﬁicult conversations

and to resolve conﬂict. ”
JANE ELLEN REID, University ombuds

W&L is “fortunate to have someone with Jane
Ellen Reid’s expertise to provide this new resource
for W&L faculty and staff,” Ruscio said recently.
“Her background in informal conﬂict resolution is
a perfect ﬁt and will serve our campus community
well.”

Reid received a B.A. in history from the Univer-
sity of Vermont and an M.E. from Northern Arizona
University. Her professional experience began at
the Western Pinal County Literacy Program in Casa
Grande, Arizona, where she worked for four years.

Reid served as the director of the Academic Sup-
port Center at Central Arizona College from 1992 to
2006. During this time, she also took on the roles of
chair of the college advisoryicouncil, faculty devel-
opment coordinator, and both developer and direc-
tor of the college ombudsman program.

Reid moved to Virginia in 2006, and started co-
teaching in the Center for Justice and Peace Build-
ing Master’s Program at Eastern Mennonite Univer-
sity in Harrisonburg.,The following year she began
working as director of University Accord, EMU’s
mediation, facilitation and job-coaching program
for faculty, staff and students.

Reid also works‘ at Bridgewater College as a
teacher of conﬂict transformation. She is also cur-
rently working on her Ph.D. in conﬂict analysis and
resolution at NOVA Southeastern University. 0

Reid says that her interest in conflict resolution
initially stemmed from “growing conﬂict at one
place of employment.”

Reid goes on to explain that in response to this
conﬂict, she and several of her peers came together.

“[We] collaborated to create an oversight group
and a declaration of civility, and to outline positive
and professional behaviors expected of all employ-
ees,” she said. “This experience was the beginning
of my commitment to the usefulness of conﬂict in-
tervention.”

Reid’s hopes are high for her new role at W&L

“I hope that my fundamental belief, that each
of us has the ability to name and communicate our
needs to others, is evident in my practice,” Reid
said. “As an ombuds, I relish the opportunity to
work with parties, to help them discover their own
capacity to address difficult conversations and to
resolve conﬂict. Coaching individuals in the art of
productive communication is one of the most satis-
fying aspects of my practice.”

The gender experiment

W&L breaks convention as both boys and girls live side—by-side on Davis second ﬂoor

By Lizz Dye
smrr WRlTER

Washington & Lee has recently
initiated a big push towards improv-
ing gendenrelations with a new ex-
periment: a co—ed residence hall in a
section of Davis Hall.

Are co-ed resident halls the an-
swer to improving gender relations?
Can men and women co-exist on a
daily basis and still maintain a sense
of inter-gender comradery and close-
ness?

Morgan Harris, graduate of the
class of 2009, believes this is pos-

sible. He came up with the initial

idea for co-ed halls his junior year
because he felt the residence halls
barred healthy, natural relations be-
tween men and women.

On this endeavor, Harris worked
alongside Katt Corr, also a gradu-
ate of the class of 2009. According
to Harris, Corr lived right above him
in Davis throughout their ﬁrst year
at W&L, but the two did not end up
meeting until the spring term of their
sophomore year.

“Now Kate is one of my best
friends,” Harris said. “Looking back,
had we lived on the same hall or
had the chance to live closer to one
another, we could’ve have become
friehds earlier in our lives.”

When men and women are living
together with their respective genders
on a hall, Harris says, they begin to
adapt the gender stereotypes associ-
ated with the sexes, which obviously
leads to problems.

He approached President Ruscio
and Dean Watkins with the idea, and
they in turn presented the idea to the
Board of Trustees. Last fall, during
Harris’s senior year, things began to
come together.

Davis residence hall is home to the first-year experimental
co-ed halls. Twelve men and thirteen women inhabit the
newest addition to W&L’s push to improve gender relations.
The brainchild of recently graduated Morgan Harris, the co-
ed halls aim to promote healthy and natural relations be-
tween men and women.

The co-ed hall is set up so that
men and women have rooms next to
one another. There are 12 men and
13 women total, and a male and fe-
male RA on the ends of the hall.

Residents indicated whether
or not they would like to live on a
co-ed hall on their living residence
preference sheet. Hall meetings may
comprise the whole hall or be gen-
der-speciﬁc, depending on the topic.

Sophomores Kate Gibbs and Ste-
phen Wilson are the hall’s two Resi-
dent Advisors. l

When asked if male and female
residents’ behavior seemed different
than those who live in same-gender
hall, Gibbs said that “we are still
building a sense of community, but
we seem like a very typical hall.”

Gibbs also said it is “too early to

- tell” whether or not gender relations

will be improved by men and wom-
en living together, but that “if we all
feel a certain responsibility for the
other members of the hall regardless
of their gender, we can all help im-
prove gender relations. ‘

First-year Katelyn Daugherty is
one of the 13 female residents on the
hall. She said she living in a co-ed
hall because she feels like she has
“a built-in family with brothers and
sisters.”

Daugherty also says it makes it
easier to meet a lot of different male
friends quickly because the boys
who already live on the hall will in-
troduce their other friends.

Taking precautions against swine ﬂu

School oﬁicials raise awareness about HINI, stressing self-treatment and prevention

Bynuoenie Wong
STAFF WRITER

With thousands of college stu-
dents returning to campus this week
and no vaccine available until mid-
October, Washington & Lee Univer-
sity ofﬁcials are emphasizing that
students protect themselves against
the HINI virus by regularly washing
their hands, befriending a ﬂu buddy
and practicing good hygiene.

“I would encourage people to
think about universal precautions.
Every contact you’ve had with an-
other person, or the environment that
other people have been in, is a po-
tential source of infection,” said Dr.

we were all, internationally, dealing
with an unknown element. We now
all know what we’re dealing with.”

Watkins, who heads the universi-
ty’s Emergency Management Team,
said that the timing of spring term
could have contributed to the last
outbreak. Students, returning from
their spring break, may have brought
back the virus from other states. '

A Respiratory Illness Survey dis-
tributed to the campus community
last spring also revealed that many
students were sharing their drinking
cups with each other.

“I think we are prepared as any university could be.

It was different in the spring because we were all,

internationally, dealing with an unknown element.

We now all know what we ’re dealing with. ”

DAWN WATKINS, VP of student affairs and dean of students

Jane Horton, the university’s director
of health services.

This is the latest effort against the
rapidly spreading HINI virus, also
called the swine ﬂu, in a college that
already had an outbreak last spring.

At least 14 students were infected
with the virus during spring term,
making W&L the ﬁrst college to
experience a swine ﬂu, outbreak in
Virginia.

“I think we are prepared as any
university could be,” said Dawn
Watkins, the vice president for stu-
dent affairs and dean of students. “It

was different in the spring because -

But the virus isn’t just spread-
ing throughout W&L. The Ameri-
can College Health Associationisays
nearly three-quarters of the country’s
higher learning institutions are now
reporting students with ﬂu-like
symptoms.

The association reported 4,045
new cases of suspected HINI inﬂu-
enza, at 149 of the 204 participat-
ing schools for the week of Aug. 29
through Sept. 4.

Unlike the seasonal ﬂu, the virus
has hit younger people and people
with an underlying health condition
harder than it has the elderly.

To protect themselves from get-
ting infected with the virus, the uni-
versity is encouraging students to
take precautions such as_ using their
own food utensils, properly covering
up a cough or sneeze and staying at
least 6 feet away from a person in-
fected with the ﬂu. 4

Advertisements throughout the
campus and a web site about the
swine ﬂu are also part of the univer-
sity’s efforts to raise awareness and
prevention.

With only 10 beds available in the
health center, and one nurse and one
physician on" call, the university is
placing more emphasis on self-treat-
ment and prevention.

“We would be completely over-
whelmed if we ended up with a big
outbreak and everyone felt like they
needed to be seen [by a doctor],”
said Dr. Horton.

Last spring, when information
about the virus remained relatively
unknown, the Virginia Department
of Health was testing students for
the HINI virus. Those with the vi-
rus were kept isolated in the student
health center.

This fall, students who experi-
ence ﬂu-like symptoms most likely
have the HINI virus, because the
seasonal ﬂu season doesn’t begin un-
til later in the year, said Dr. Horton.
The good news, she said, is that the
new strain of ﬂu doesn’t appear any
more severe than the seasonal ﬂu.

Students with a fever less than
100 degrees Fahrenheit probably
do not need to see a doctor unless
they’re V experiencing -more seri-
ous symptoms such as shortness of

breath and chest pains.

Those with the ﬂu are recom-
mended to self-isolate themselves at
home until theirfever is gone for 24
hours without fever-reducing medi-
cine.

They should also have a ﬂu buddy
to bring them food and their school
assignments so they reduce the pos-
sibility of infecting other students
and staff members on campus.

While the Virginia Department
of Health is no longer testing for
the HINI virus, it recommends that
everyone get both the seasonal and
swine ﬂu vaccines once they become
available.

“We’re expecting that this vaccine
will be pretty effective, but we never
know until after the fact exactly how
effective,” said Dr. Mark Levine, the
department’s deputy commissioner
for emergency preparedness and re-
sponse programs.

Levine said that the department
expects everyone in Virginia who
wants to get vaccinated against the
HINI virus to be able to once the
vaccine is distributed.

olonnade under construction
Newcomb shows‘ signs of renovation, new grant oﬂers more funds for updating the hall is interior and classrooms ‘V

By Valaree Tang
STAFF WRITER

A recent grant will go toward
the continued renovation of
Washington and Lee’s cherished
Colonnade. ‘

The university began its Col-
onnade renovation after gradua-
tion last year, staring with New-
comb Hall, in efforts to provide
a better learning environment for
the most used building on cam-

move into the 28 faculty offices
located inside Newcomb. The
remodeled space will also have
two classrooms and three semi-
nar rooms, which hold 12 to 15
students each. The classrooms
will have ﬁat screen monitors as
part of an audio-visual package.
While the exterior of New-
comb Hall will remain the. same,

We are all anticipating having an environ-

ment which will allow for the most modern

classroom technologies and for opportunities

to meet informally with eachother and with

our students in our new lounges.

pus.

Enabling work on Newcomb
Hall began in April. Newcomb,
the home of the history and soci-
ology and anthropology depart-
ments as well as the teacher-edu-
cation program, is the ﬁrst of the
ﬁve buildings on the Colonnade
to undergo renovation. Construc-
tion is expected to last for 14
months, ending in July 2010 and
totaling $10 million.

These improvements include
maintenance endowment, tech-
nology and furnishings. Con-
struction and renovation of the
rest of the Colonnade is expected
to continue for ﬁve years. .

Following the completion
of Newcomb Hall, faculty will

the interior will undergo “reha-
bilitation”, according to Thomas
Kalasky, director of design and
construction.

The renovation includes cre-
ating' student lounges and bring-
ing the buildings up to code. This
means that an elevator will be

built in Newcomb, while the his-'

torical architectural features of

the building will be preserved.
David Novack, head of the

department of sociology and

anthropolgy, said, “We are all_

anticipating having an environ-
ment which will allow for the
most modern classroom tech-
nologies and for opportunities to
meet informally with each other
and with our students in our new

lounges.”

Novack is also looking for-
ward to rejoining his colleagues
on campus after working from
his ofﬁce in the former. Baker
Residence Hall.

David Peterson, acting head
of the history department also
looks forward to returning to
campus. Peterson believes that
the improvements will comple-
ment the History Department.

“The history department has
always prided itself on the qual-
ity of its teaching. Having all
new, state-of-the-art classrooms
will clearly be an incentive to
"continue our commitment to
pedagogical innovation and the
development of our classroom
presentation skills,” said Peter-
son.

Newcomb Hall enhance-
ments include infrastructure
upgrades, such as wiring and
air conditioning. However, the
characteristic features of New-
comb such as. its ﬁreplaces
and chalkboards will be main-
tained.

In addition to aesthetic
changes, Newcomb is also being
renovated to meet Leadership in
Energy and Environmental De-
sign (LEED) qualiﬁcations.

The teacher-education pro-
gram was never located in
Newcomb Hall before, and
Lenna Ojure, directorof teacher
education, said she is excited
about the move. “This will be a
new experience for us. We are
looking forward to being in a

Workers scale the exterior of Newcomb hall, updating the structure of the build-
ing. Work began in the spring and is scheduled to be completed by July 2010.
Newcomb is the first of the five buildings on the Colonnade to be rennovated, ‘C

Co-ed hall

continued from page 1

Although she has enjoyed co-ed liv-
ing so far, she also says there is a disad-
vantage to seeing the boys all the time
because she feels like they revert into
the “typical guy” and perhaps say and do
things they normally do when they are
not around girls.

Male resident ﬁrst—year Nick Cianci-
olo feels entirely differently about living
with women. He believes that co-ed liv-

ing has a shot at improving gender rela-
tions; however, if he could choose to do
it all over again, he would deﬁnitely live
in an all-male hall.

Cianciolo feels that his fellow male
residents are missing out on the male
comradery that develops between same-
gender halls and that the residents are not
“banding together” as they would if they
did not live with girls.

ﬁc and more colleagues.”

The Lettie Pate Evans grant
provided $1 million toward the
Newcomb Hall renovation. This
grant is in addition to contribu-
tions from alumni and trustees.
Initial plans «for the renewal of
Newcomb were brought on by
a grant from the Getty Founda-
tion.

While the funding for the
other buildings has not been
provided yet, creative ﬁnancing
through tax credits, which pro-
vides funding for a building that
qualiﬁes as a historical structure
and follows interior qualiﬁca-
tions, may be implemented for
work done on the following four
buildings.

The Lettie Pate Evans grant
program emphasizes private
secondary and higher educa-
tion programs, arts and culture,
museums and historic preserva-
tion in Georgia and Virginia and
provides grants for other public
charities.

Traditionally, the foundation
gives priority to 0ne—time capi-
tal projects and well-established
organizations with extraordinary
needs.

Fund-raising for the renova-
tion of the entire Colonnade is
still on-going. The project is esti-
mated to cost $50 million, taking
at least ﬁve years to complete.
Foundations continue to be an
important part of the beautiﬁca-

tion of the Colonnade.

Phase two of the Colonnade
renovation, which includes the
remodeling of Payne, Washing-
ton and Robinson Halls are in the
design phase.

He also thinks that if he were not on
the football team, it would be more dif-
ﬁcult to make friends because there is a
smaller margin of men that he can see
and talk to on a daily basis.

Harris said that “the infrastructure
of W&L is still ﬁmdamentally ﬂawed
on many levels, but this co-ed hall is a
clear step in the right direction and it
will hopeﬁilly inspire future leaders at

W&L to make it a better place to live and
learn.”

Harris ultimately stressed that he is
not being negative in his criticism, but
hopes that mixed halls will spark activ-
ism to change more things the students
can and should be responsible for. in
shaping their college experience.

According to Harris, it is the job of
W&L students to change and shape the

four-year experience. New co-ed hous-
ing could be built to accommodate up-
perclassmen to further the gender inte-
gration, he said.

Giving Libertarians at W&L the lesson they need

Although it may be cool to be a Libertarian, true Republicans need to identify with their own party

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

It’s September and college
life has ﬁnally returned. While
some of us are new and most
are getting back in the swing of
things, we must all remember to
avoid some dangerous pitfalls
that harm most college students.

Sometimes it’s okay to fol-
low what everyone else is doing
during college. You probably
should be investing in Wendy’s
and Natty Light instead of the
much healthier but also more ex-
pensive alternatives. You prob-
ably should start going to classes
and doing homework, if only to
keep your parents at peace. And
most importantly, you probably
should follow that car full of
ﬁrst-year girls headed towards
Pole Three. In those cases, fol-
lowing the crowd can have posi-
tive consequences.

However, those are still ex-
ceptions to the rule. Following
the crowd can also be dangerous,
especially when it comes to poli-
tics. Ask most of the conservative
and independent Obama voters
how they feel about change and
hope right now, and they’ll prob-
ably register for a handgun to
point at you. That is why I want
you to be weary of following the
political trend at Washington &
Lee right now.

I am warning you to please
not become a Libertarian.

For the last couple of years,
Libertarians have become a rela-
tive phenomenon. In fact, they
have gotten so big that they have
entered our cultural stratosphere.

After Ron Paul made it on “The
Colbert Report” and “Bruno,”
being Libertarian officially be-
came cool. If you walk around
enough parties here, you will
hear at least one or two guys
trying to explain why Obama’s
health care plan is ﬁscally irre-
sponsible. These guys, who use
CSPAN to get themselves laid,
are guys you will see a lot more
of now that econ class and par-
ties happen the same day.

I have a problem with these
guys.

This problem did not start
with our generation. Fortunately,
we can blame our parents for
this one. When the Baby Boom-
ers hit college in the ‘60s, they
hated their parents and wanted to
see the world drastically change.
That’s when liberalism got big.
However, when the Baby Boom-
ers hit college, they also wanted
to get laid. That’s when liberal-
ism got annoying.

When you think of the 60s you
think of tie-dye, drugs and some
fun music. What you don’t think
of is that guy in “Animal House”
playing folk music on his guitar
to a bunch of girls... that is, un-
til John Belushi came down the
stairs and obliterated the guitar.
John Belushi was making a state-
ment in that scene: occasionally
it’s okay to be a Free Love Lib-
eral, but please don’t use it for
the wrong reasons.

Being the offspring of the
Baby Boomers, we still have that
same anger for what our parents

represent and the same energy
for changing in the world. Sadly,
we don’t have liberalism to turn
to because our parents already
stole that idea.

Instead, we went back the
other way... to the dark side. We
became Republicans.

George Bush didn’t make it
easy by making a couple of, uh,
questionable decisions in his pe-

relevant or dim-witted. In a lot of
cases, they actually have a point.
But with that overall philosophy,
anyone with a C in microeco-
nomics can make himself appear
intelligent to an unsuspecting
ﬁrst-year girl.

By now, most of the liberals
reading this piece are either nod-
ding their heads with a smile or
are furious because this media

Some students seem to mix up being a Libertarian

and being a Republican. If you are in love with lais-

sez faire economics and small government, you are a

Republican and NOT a Libertarian.

 

riod. Plus, being Republican was
so 1950. We wanted something
better, something cooler and
something that got us laid.

That’s where Libertarianism
comes into play.

Libertarianism is awesome
because basically you are saying
that the government should play
the same role in your life as The
Trident: something that is tech-
nically there, but doesn’t affect
your life whatsoever.

All the work is already done
for you because there’s nothing
that you really have to work for.
Basically, you are just a resident
at the Player Hater’s Ball.

Now, I don’t want to say that
what Libertarians are saying is ir-

outlet has not mentioned them
nearly enough, and I’m guess-
ing the Republicans reading
this piece are unanimously mad
at my audacious attack on their
kind. But just stay with me a little
while more, Republicans. Trust
me, I don’t hate you or your kind
all that much.

The main problem is that
some students seem to mix up
being a Libertarian and being a
Republican. If you are in love
with laissezfaire economics and
small government, you are a Re-
publican and not a Libertarian.
You can say that maybe you are
ﬁscally Republican and socially
Democrat, but even that combi-
nation does not mean you are a

real Libertarian. You need to go
a little ﬁirther.

Libertarians are an indepen-
dent party and to like anything
independent, you need to like it
a little too much.

To be into indie music, you
need to really like music. To
follow independent and smaller
leagues like the CFL or the MLS,
you need to like that certain

sport more than you should. To
choose RC Cola over Coke or
Pepsi, you should... get a CAT
scan because you probably
need a helmet. Still, you get
the point. Going outside of the
mainstream is hard work, and
you need to care about being
Libertarian a little too much.
Since I don’t hate all Liber-
tarians, just the ones who have
no idea what they are talking
about, I have come up with some
ways of knowing if your love for
Bob Barr and Ron Paul is legiti-
mate.

If you knew who Ron Paul
was before April 2008, you prob-
ably know what you are talking
about.

If you know anything about
the Libertarian platform besides
their basic ideals, you should not
have any issues.

Most importantly, if your
choice of political party has
somehow increased your number
of friends or hookups, you are
not a true Libertarian.

In high school, I had two
friends who decided early on
they wanted to be in independent

parties. The ﬁrst was a hardcore
Green Party member. He cam-
paigned heavily for Nadar and
would talk about seatbelts to
anyone who asked. Needless to
say, that did not get him far with
the opposite sex, so eventually he
just gave up, became a Democrat
and joined the rest of society.

My other friend, who was a
Libertarian, never got the memo
and ended up staying with his
independent party. And while
his friends were out making mis-
takes during their senior spring,
he was in his room watching Ron
Paul interviews.

These are two extreme cases
and most likely if you are a Lib-
ertarian, you will not lose friends.
That being said, to follow some-
thing you claim to like so much,
you need to put in some effort.

So all I ask is that if you are
not willing to put in that effort
(it’s 2009, the next real election
is three years away... don’t put
in the effort), then just man up
and tell people that you are a Re-
publican.

It’s not hard: all you are doing
is getting rid of one syllable and
defending George Bush a little
more than you would like to.

Trust me, you’ll be able to
sleep better at night.

Ladies and Gentlemen. . ..

Welcome to another year at
Washington & Lee. Fall is in the
unseasonably cool air. Perhaps
because we started at an oddly
late date in September, or per-
haps just because.

Once again, deep into the
night, music is pumping all along
Randolph Street and the scents
of Natural Light and authentic
Burberry perfumes waft out of
the doors of the Pole Houses.

Whatever the reason, we know
that W&L is back in business.

I’d like to welcome the newest
class of students. 2013, you’ve
chosen an interesting, demand-

that, if ﬁlmed, would make a fan-
tastic sequel to “Animal House.”
Or maybe a documentary on the
Discovery Channel.

I’d like to welcome you all to
this thrilling, challenging place,
and offer yet another challenge to
you: maintain your selves. Grow,
learn, thrive and maybe even
change throughout your college
experience, but do not lose your-
selves.

Your eccentricities are fantas-
tic. Your distinct personalities,
necessary. And your diverse pas-

the vivacity of our school.

While you are here, be open
to and embracing of others. Ev-
eryone makes mistakes, learns

crucial lessons, and decides who

time here.

The point of college is to
get a higher education. Falling
victim to narrow-mindedness is
anything but educated behavior.
Question the beliefs you came
here with, and certainly question
the ideas, behaviors and norms
that are presented to you here.

You will be pushed to look
at the world through fresh eyes.
Whther it be a topic in class, in
a social situation or in one of my

That being said, I welcome
the opportunity to discuss your
opinions with you, as I hope to
challenge some perspectives in

Abel Delgado takes President Ruscio is Convocation speech to heart

By Abel Delgado
co LU M N I sr

As I sat in front of Lee Chapel
for Convocation listening to Pres-
ident Ruscio give a timely and
necessary speech, one thought
kept going through my head: ‘I
wish more upperclassmen were
here to hear this.’ While most of
the students in the audience were
ﬁrst-years, the message to the up-
perclassmen was clear.

In much kinder and more elo-
quent words, President Ruscio
elaborated on a message some
of us needed to hear: grow up.

It is some of us upperclass-
men, after all, who have failed
to show anything remotely ap-
proaching appropriate behavior
for our age. The President, a
former W&L student himself,
rightfully called us out on it.

President Ruscio mentioned
two problems we upperclass-
men are accustomed to being
lectured about: sexual assault and
hazing.

We can all agree that there
should be no incidents of sexual
assault in an intellectual commu-
nity like ours that prides itself on
its honor and integrity.

But let’s be honest, the rea-
son the sexual assault rate is as
high as it is because some of us
believe that imbibing ridiculous

amounts of alcohol guarantees us
the right to act ridiculous and that
we should not be held responsible
for anything we do while drunk
and blackout.

Sexual assaults will go down
when the students, especially we
male students on this campus,
stop believing that Natty erases
responsibility, or that the Honor
System goes away at night.

There was one topic the Pres-
ident addressed that caught my
attention the most.

“Malicious words anony-
mously posted on intemet sites
are cowardly and shame all of
us,” Ruscio said. Cowardly is a
good way of putting it; patheti-
cally immature is another.

A few weeks ago, my friend
sent me a link to an open discus-

In much kinder and eloquent words, President

Ruscio elaborated on a message some of us

need to hear — grow up.

That same resurgence of re-
sponsibility could help to end
hazing, as well. We spend most
of our ﬁrst winter term quietly
complaining to our friends about
how rough we have it, and then
we go about the next three years
ensuring everyone who comes
after us has it just as bad.

This is notjust illogical, but
also petty and immature.

sion on the Class of 2013 Face-
book group. Like many upper-
classmen, I had given the group
page a glance-over once or twice
but I never got the urge to open a
fake account so I could ridicule
other organizations and people
on campus.

The discussion my friend
showed me regarded what up-
perclassmen were posting on an-

other site, ridiculing the entering
class even before they arrived on
campus.

The freshmen were rightfully
upset. Anonymous jerks had giv-
en them a rather poor impression
of what it meant to act honor-
ably.

We’re better than this. At
least, we should be.

What may seem as harmless
fun online can have some pretty
nasty results. Rumors spread like
wildﬁres on social networking
sites, and the damage done by
false ones is often unﬁxable in
small communities such as our
own.

I’m of the mind that if you’re
going to ridicule someone, you
should at least have the decency
to face him or her directly in per-
son. That way, the person can
respond.

These cowards, who signed
the same card during their fresh-
men year that we all did, promis-
ing to follow Lee’s one rule, have
failed to act like gentlemen.

We may not know who they
are, but they know. And if they
care in the least about what’s
makes this school “a place like no
other,” then they will take Presi-
dent Ruscio’s words to heart.

Sage advice for starting college with class

By Stephanie Hardlman
ARTS & LlFE EDITOR

After a week at W&L, you might
think you’ve got it all ﬁgured out.

You’re wrong.

Navigating the mineﬁeld of the
ﬁrst year is an art and one that re-
quires more than just a sweet posse
and Daddy’s credit card.

exciting and opens up a new chap-
ter of freedom in your life. But call
Mom once a week and tell her you
miss her. Let Dad know you wish
you were watching the football
game with him. You never know
when you might need to make bail,

“When you get drunk and pee yourself on Windfall

or do something unprintable at Late Night, some-

one will be there to notice, and then they will tell

EVERYONE. ”

The pattern you set this year will
pave the way for the rest of your
college career. As a good Samaritan,
I’m providing some tips to make
sure you come out on top:

Don’t get over-involved — It’s
easy to get wrapped up in the e-mail
lists and beckoning of the obligatory
Domino’s dinners at evening meet-
ings. But no one can be a star mem-
ber in every club, and eventually
people learn they can’t count on you
because you’re spread too thin. Pick
a few things you’re really commit-
ted to, be involved, stick with them,
and maybe in a year or two you’ll be
made the group’s president.

Know your place — No one likes
the know-it-all ﬁrst-year whose sole
aim is to show up other students
and impress the prof. As President
Ruscio said during my ﬁrst O-Week,
“90 percent of you were in the top 10
percent of your class. In 12 weeks,
only 10 percent of you will be.” So
get off your high horse and learn
some humility. You may have been
Christ lncamate in high school, but
here no one cares. We were all that
person. We’ve been here longer than
you have. Earn your keep.

Stay on your parents’ good side
— Being away from Mom and Dad is

and good relations with the ‘rents
are always in style.

Don’t be a fool — One ofthe perks
of winter rush is that upperclassmen
get to know you before extending
a bid. When you get drunk and pee
yourself on Windfall or do some-
thing unprintable at Late Night,
someone will be there to 119.108, and
then they will tell EVERYONE. And
then you will be known by an inap-
propriate nickname instead of your
given name (or your middle name if
you’re one of “those” people).

Enjoy this time you’re given
~ This is a time of blissful unaware-
ness. You don’t yet have to worry
about bills, fraﬂsrat drama, applying
to grad school, degree requirements,
deciding if you should marry your
college sweetheart or ﬁnding a job.

Some day it’ll be May of senior
year and you’ll be one of the 15 mil-
lion unemployed people out there,
thinking maybe you should’ve just
become a police ofﬁcer like Steve
from high school because at least
then you’d have a job. And you’ll
think back on this time fondly, sigh,

- and head to the Palms to drown your

sorrows.
Let this be a lesson.

_ Volleyball shows strength against SVU

Generals close out W&L Invitational at 3-1 to open the season, team hopes for a ninth ODAC championship

By Adam Cancryn
smrr wrmsn

A thrilling ﬁve-set victory over
Southern Virginia University salvaged a
tough opening weekend for Washington
& Lee’s women’s volleyball team.

After suffering two losses on the
ﬁrst day of the W&L Invitational Tour-
nament, the Generals dominated SVU’s
front line with power hitting and solid
blocking to notch their ﬁrst win of the
season. '

Junior middle blocker Louise Brooks
led the team with 20 kills and sopho-
more middle blocker Lindsey Dee add-
ed 10 kills, providing a steady offensive
presence throughout the back-and-forth
match.

W&L jumped on SVU from the start,
taking an early 10-3 lead. Overmatched
at the net, Southern Virginia could not
respond to the Generals’ multiple hit-
ting options. Led by Brooks, Dee and
senior outside hitter Rachael Phillips,
W&L grew the margin to 10 before
cruising to a 25-14 victory.

However, a markedly improved
SVU defense stalled W&L’s offense,
allowing SVU to respond and take the
second set, 25-19.

Southern Virginia looked primed to
take the third set as well after opening
with a 10-4 lead, but a string of great
blocks led to an 11-3 Generals run that
put them ahead for good.

Pushed to the brink, SVU rallied for
a 25-21 fourth-set victory to force a de-

cisive ﬁnal set.

Early in set ﬁve, Brooks overpow-
ered SVU’s defense with two outside
kills, giving W&L an apparent 8-7 edge

as the teams switched sides. But after
a brief delay, oﬂicials determined that

the Generals had served out of rotation, '

a penalty that cost them a point and the
lead. ‘
Suddenly down, W&L responded by
tying it with a kill from sophomore out-
side hitter Megan Daily. Though SVU
took the lead late at 15-14, the Generals’

said. “We stayed aggressive and [SVU]
didn’t  I thought that was a big key.”

The Generals ﬁnished the weekend
1-3 following a 3-0 Saturday evening

loss to top-ranked Emory University.
But Snider said W&L’s tomnament
play met his expectations.

“This is our ﬁrst weekend playing,
and all of the other teams have already
played,” he said. “I was pretty pleased
in general. You never like to lose, but
I thought the girls played hard and ex-
ecuted a lot of the things that we’re try-

"We knew it ’d be tough and thats why we brought these

teams in here. We stayed agressive and [S VU] didn ’t...I

thought that was a big key. ’

BRIAN SNIDER, Head Coach

overwhelming hitting power carried the
team to a 20-18 win that clinched the
match.

The win showed serious improve-

ment from their opening round, 3-0
losses to both Christopher Newport and
second-ranked Juniata, said head coach
Brian Snider.

“We knew it’d be tough. The com-
petition was extremely tough and that’s
why we brought these teams in here,” he

ing to do.” . ’

W&L is looking to capture its ninth
consecutive ODAC Championship.
Though the team lost a few key play-
ers, the pieces are still in place for the
veteran team to make a run through the
conference.

Phillips, the reigning ODAC Player
of the Year, teamed with Brooks to re-
cord 78 kills in four matches. Add in the
increased inﬂuence of Dee, who regis-

tered more kills over the weekend than
she did all of last year, and W&L can
gain the front-line advantage over most
other teams. ‘

But the key will be the play of the
back line following the institution of a
new defensive system. Snider said that
he wants to limit the movement in the
back and give his players the freedom
to go after the ball.

Much of the new strategy’s suc-
cess will hinge on the performance of
W&L’s only ﬁrst-year starter, libero
Cameron Hill. In addition to acting as a

defensive specialist, she must coordi-
nate the entire team’s defense.

“We’re putting a lot on her, respon-
sibility-wise,” said Snider. “But she
took huge steps forward this week-
end.”

W&L will face Randolph-Macon
on September 16 in its ﬁrst confer—.
ence match.

° First-years lead at W&L Invitational

Both the mens and women is cross country teams looked strong in the season opener this weekend

By Rebecca Mickel and
Alex Cummings
STAFF WRITERS

“Run like you stole something.”

‘That was the phrase that pushed
Washington & Lee runners to the ﬁnish
line as they opened_ their cross country
season with the Washington and Lee In-
vitational on Saturday and it was good
enough to steal some victories.

The season opener, hosted at the Dick
Miller Cross Country course, showed
promising expectations for the upcom-
ing season.

The women’s team completed the 5K
with an average time of 21 :34.20, while
the men’s team completed the 8K with
an average time of 29:23.20.

Both the women’s and men’s teams
ﬁnished the meet in second place, los-
ing out only to the University of Mary
Washington.

The men’s team was led by ﬁrst-year
Harrison Tucker who took ﬁrst place
with a time of 28245. Junior Joe Stusek
ﬁnished fourth with a time of 29:22, fol-
lowed by ﬁrst-year Tyler Gehrs in sev-
enth with a time of 29:30.

F irst-year Lauren Schultz was the top

runner for the women’s team, turning
out a second-place ﬁnish with a time of
20:41. Senior Kat Telfeyan‘ also turned

“It’s so helpful to have an upperclass-
man as a mentor to work out with and
run next to during practice and meets,”

"Its a lot of fun this year. We have a really great

group dynamic, and we hope to continue working well
together. I wouldn’t trade this for the world. ”

ROSEMARY KELLEY, senior

in an impressive ﬁnish for the Generals,
coming in fourth with a time of 21 : 14.

But for the W&L cross country
coaches, more focus is being placed
upon group effort, rather individual suc-
cess.

In her seventh year as the head wom-
en’s cross country coach, Kris Hoey, has
placed emphasis on the buddy strategy,
inspiring this year’s fairly young team
with the motto “Partners in Crime.” So
far, the strategy seems to be working.

said Schultz.

After losing four of last year’s top
seven runners, the team is looking to
make the most out of its new runners.
And in the ﬁrst meet of the season, the
newcomers proved they could handle the
pressure, with a ﬁrst-year runner leading
both the men’s and women’s teams.

“The freshmen did a great job step-
ping up and recognizing the spaces that
needed to be ﬁlled,” said senior captain
Dorothy Todd.

While Todd and fellow captain Kath-
erine F enwick are currently injured and
were unable to race this weekend, their
enthusiasm was in no way diminished.

“It’s good to be able to turn them on
from the sideline, and it also gives a dif-
ferent perspective about what needs to
be done,” said F enwick.

With practices six days a week, the
team focuses on developing race pace
and uses tempo training to increase
speed and to strengthen endurance. But
then strenuous schedule does not com-
promise the teammates’ overall sense of
camaraderie.

“It’s a lot of fun this year,” said se-

nior Rosemaiy Kelley, who ﬁnished in
13th place with a time of 22: 12.

“We have a really great group dy-
namic, and we hope to continue work-
ing well together. I wouldn’t trade this
for the world.” ‘

Next on tap for the men’s team is
the Guilford Invitational next Satur-
day. Both teams will be back in action
the following weekend at the Roanoke

Invitational in a preview of the ODAC
Championship course.

W&L football bounces back

Generals improve to 1-1 with a 31-13 victory over Sewanee Saturday

By Andrew Bonds
smrr wmn-zn

The Generals (1-1) recovered from
their close 29-27 loss to Franklin & Mar-
shall in last week’s home opener with a
decisive 31-13 victory over long-time ri-
val Sewanee. The Generals’ offense put
them ahead on the scoreboard, but the
true story of the game was Washington &
Lee’s defensive performance. With seven
combined turnovers between the two
teams, senior captain defensive lineman
Matt Cassilly led the defensive effort, re-
cording four tackles, one tackle for a loss,
one sack, and two interceptions, one of
which was returned for a game-changing
touchdown‘ with 13:04 left in the second
quarter.

“Cassilly was unreal,” said fellow
senior defensive lineman Beau Craparo.
“His performance today was one of the
best I have ever seen since I have been
playing football here. As a team 1 think
we played really well. Our offense is still
evolving, but overall I think it was a solid
game.” ,

Cassilly’s strong play was comple-
mented by senior defensive back Donavon
Sawyer’s eight tackles and one intercep-
tion, and senior defensive lineman Rick
Barron’s seven tackles.

Offensively, the Generals continued to
utilize the spread option, with sophomore
quarterback Charlie Westfal leading the
team on the ground, rushing for 70 yards
and a touchdown. With the loss of Stuart
Sitterson, one of the most statistically ac-

complished players in W&L football his- 3

tory, the Generals have added shotgun sets
to their offense as they look to throw the
ball more than last year. However, sopho-

already stepped into his new role, running
for 50 yards and two touchdowns.

and overcame a late game drive by the Ti-
gers to win the game.

“Today was a big game for us, espe-
cially after last week,” said sophomore
tight end Jake Tunney. “Sewanee was a
good team, but we just outlasted them and
made more plays late in the game.”

Simply making more plays when it
counted seemed to be the theme of the
game, as the defense was able to force
more turnovers than the offense gave up,
in large part because of Cassi1ly’s one-
man show.

Coming off of the ﬁrst win of the sea-
son, the Generals will face Greensboro
College next Saturday at 1:00 p.m. on

Field hockey keeps ‘heads held high’
W&L ﬁeld hockey player Lizz Dye takes us behind the scenes of this
weekends opening games against Johns Hopkins and McDaniel

By Lizz Dye
surr wrmza

Nothing in sports brings more antici-
pation, excitement, adrenaline, and fear
than the ﬁrst game of the season, espe-
cially when your ﬁrst opponent is No. 11-’
ranked Johns Hopkins University. On a
cool Friday evening under the lights we,
the Generals Field Hockey Team, played
Johns Hopkins University in an exciting
well-fought game. We had only played
together as a team for two weeks before
we had to face the Blue Jays, who were
already 2-0. But we knew from previous
experience that we were going to bring
our best to the ﬁeld.

From the beginning, each team played
with heart. The drive to win was evident
on both sides. The Blue Jays struck ﬁrst: a
little over 13 minutes into the game, Johns
Hopkins senior forward Gabi Henn scored
the ﬁrst goal of the game off an assist from
fellow senior forward Andrea Vandersall.
Standing on the sideline, I could tell that
we were frustrated by the goal, but the
cheers from our team and our fans kept
our heads held high. Five minutes later,
the Blue Jays managed to score again
with an unassisted goal by their ﬁrst-year
forward Meghan Kellett. We suffered an-
other blow when junior midﬁelder Emmy
Mathews was taken out by ‘a yellow card
for ﬁve minutes near the end of the ﬁrst
half, and we were forced to play one down
against the formidable Blue Jays.

But despite the setbacks of the ﬁrst
half, we overcame our initial ﬁrst-game
jitters and held Johns Hopkins scoreless in
the second half. Head Coach Wendy Or-
rison told us that there was a noticeable
improvement in intensity from the ﬁrst

half to the second. She also said that al-

Interpreting

Constitution day speaker
Louis Fisher argues
against judicial supremacy

By Jessica Strait
STAFF WRITER

Two hundred and twenty-two years ago, a
document was adopted by the Constitutional Con-
vention, and from that moment on it became the
supreme law of the United States. To celebrate
and mark Constitution Day, Washington and Lee
invited Louis Fisher, an author, scholar, researcher
and government consultant, to speak in Stack-
house Theater about Judicial Supremacy, the idea
that the Supreme Court has more power than other
branches to interpret the Constitution.

Fisher said the Founders regarded the Supreme
Court as the least threatening branch of govern-
ment, and he used historical examples to argue
that judicial supremacy was never intended, has
never existed and never should exist. His speech
was especially relevant after a summer of media
attention focused on the nomination of Sonia So-
tomayor, now a Supreme Court justice.

Fisher said the Constitution is for all of us to
interpret, pointing out that most of our rights and
liberties come from us and the values we hold
dear, not from court rulings. The most direct
communication through citizens and government
is through jury decisions.

' When the Supreme Court rules on a case, the
public is involved in constitutional law through
their reactions to these decisions. In the past,
the Court has changed rulings when the public
overwhelmingly disagrees. In 1940 the Supreme
Court ruled upheld a compulsory ﬂag salute for
students in school. In 1942 they declared the case
“wrongly decided,” and credit for the overturned
decision went to the whole country, more speciﬁ-
cally the people who did not accept it and voiced
their disgust.

Fisher stressed that even if the Supreme Court
votes unanimously on a case, policy does not
change until a law or statute is passed. In 1954, the
Supreme Court struck down the idea of .“separate
but equal” in Brown v. The Board of Education.
However, until Congress passed the Civil Rights
Act in 1964, almost zero social changes came out
ofthe 1954 ruling.

And often, if Congress does not agree, it will
pass a law to make its point, proving that the Su-
preme Court has far from the ﬁnal say. When the
Supreme Court upheld a decision in 1986 deny-
ing a Jewish Air Force ofﬁcer the right to wear a
yarmulke while he testiﬁed, the court justiﬁed it
by claiming that the military needs uniformity. A
year later, Congress, which obviously disagreed,
passed a law that allowed the wearing of religious
gear as long as it does not interfere with duty.

Fisher also said the Supreme Court is frilly
aware that it makes mistakes. He said that “the
Court in its better moments has recognized it’s
a joint enterprise,” reinforcing that the purpose
the country’s three branch governmental sys-
tem, including two branches within Congress,
is a precaution to keep other branches in check.
Chief Justice Earl Warren once reﬂected that just
because the Court ruled that something was con-
stitutional did not necessarily answer the question
of whether it is. ..

So then, why and how did Judicial Suprema-
cy become such a popular misconceived notion?
Citizens often overlook what comes after a Su-
preme court ruling. Fisher also blames journalists
for reinforcing the all-powerful stereotype of the
Supreme Court by polling citizens about which
branch has the most power, all while hoping for
“the Supreme Court” as the largest percentage an-
swer simply because it seems to make more waves
in the news.

Fisher emphasized that the court can let their
opinions be known, but it is citizens who, in the
end, make the ﬁnal decisions that form the values
and shape the laws of our country.

Starting with Orientation Week, .

Washington and Lee students are con-
stantly reminded of the prevalence of
sexual assault on our campus. This
fall W&L students had the chance to
enroll in a course that attempts to do
something about it.

Senior Emily Coyle said that she

ized that no action had been taken de-
spite the discussion in the class. She
consulted with>Bell who developed
a curriculum that Coyle describes as
“the most perfect manifestation of
what I had been imagining when I
brought the idea to her.”

The new course, taught by Bell

“1 hope to raise awareness of sexual misconduct

the prevalence of sexual misconduct. ”

EMILY COYLE, senlor

got the idea for a class focusing on
sexual assault at W&L after her ex-
perience in Professor Melina Bell’s
Philosophy of Sexual Assault class.
According to Coyle, for the students’
ﬁnal project, they had to write a sexu-
al misconduct policy for W&L. Sev-
eral students from the class presented
their ﬁndings at the Science, Society
and the Arts conference last winter.
At the end of the tenn, Coyle real-

Sowing the seeds of justice  

this tenn, is the Sexual Assault Pre-
vention Workshop, offered through
the Women’s and Gender Studies De-
partment.

In the workshop the 11 students
discuss topics ranging from the party
scene at W&L, to the sexual assault
laws in the state of Virginia, to the at-
titudes that members of each sex have
about the other. Students approach the
subject from all disciplines, including

philosophy, law, psychology, sociol-
ogy and public health.

Their homework does not consist
of traditional papers and exams, but
instead projects to gather information
and raise consciousness about sexual
assault at W&L; According to Bell,
at the end of the term, students “will
come up with a proposal for how to

. implement the solutions they come

up with, and present these solutions
in an open W&L forum to receive
feedback from the community, and
hopefully to recruit as many students
as possible to help implement the so-
lutions.”

Coyle said she hopes to change
students’ attitudes regarding sexual
conduct and make them aware of
what they can do to prevent it.

“I hope to raise awareness of sex-
ual misconduct issues on our campus
primarily in the domain of empower-
ing students to do something about
them. I would like students ﬁrst to feel
that they can reduce the prevalence of
sexual misconduct,” she said.

“I think belief that we are capable
of effecting that change ourselves is
an important ﬁrst step in reducing
sexual violence. I would also like to
see the second step that follows from
that belief—students acting to reduce

sexual misconduct.”

Bell echoed Emily’s sentiments
and said that" she ﬁnds a problem with
the campus’s current tolerance of as-
sault.

“Our speaker from Project Ho-
rizon, Judy Casteele, expressed her
view that W&L students are some-
times afraid to report being sexually
assaulted because they believe it will
be social suicide. She asked why it
is not social suicide to commit sexual
assault,” Bell said.

For students interested in support-
ing this new effort, Bell has recom-
mended a few upcoming events. On
Sept. 23, members of the Lexington
police department and the Rockbridge
County sheriff’s ofﬁce will speak on
police handling of reported sexual as-
sault cases. Their talk will take place
in Wilson 2018 at 2:30 p.m.

On Oct. 7 at 2:30 p.m. in Stack-
house Theater, students can get a male
perspective on male-female relations

nus, or Planet Earth?” This presenta-
tion will be an entertaining one-hour

W&L Law and Grimes Law embark on second year in Liberia Human Rights Practicuum

By Katherine Roberts
COPY EDITOR

The Washington and Lee Uni-
versity School of Law is starting its
second year in the Liberia Human
Rights Practicuum with a joint class
held with students in Liberia.

The practicuum is a partnership
with the Louis A. Grimes School of
Law at the University of Liberia in
Monrovia to work on increasing jus-
tice in Liberia.

The program, which also works
with the United Nations Ofﬁce on
Drugs and Crime and the American
Bar Association in Monrovia, fea-
tures a joint class of W&L and Libe-
rian law_students. W&L Law Profes-

p sor Speedy Rice teaches the class by

videoconference-—the Liberian law
students meet at the US. Embassy in
Monrovia, according to Ryan Decker,
who coordinates the class from Libe-
ria. If heavy rains cause problems
with the video feed, Decker teaches
the class.

“Class time can serve unique and
different purposes for the W&L and
Liberian students,” Decker said.

While the course teaches W&L
students about a completely different
legal system, it exposes Liberian stu-
dents to “material not covered under
their normal legal curriculum, and...
a practical way of developing solu-
tions to the issues preventing access
to justice in Liberia,” he said.

The class learns about human
rights on international and regional
levels before focusing on Liberia,
according to Juliette Syn, who ﬁlled
Decker’s role last year. In November,
W&L students will visit Monrovia for
two weeks and interview prisoners to
learn about civil rights in court.

Over 85 percent of the prisoners
who students from this program inter-
viewed last year were still in pretrial,
according to Syn. She attributed this
to the civil war that ran from 1989 to
2003, and the subsequent loss of in-
frastructure necessary for the justice
system. “Although you might have
a judge, you may not have a support
staff,” she said. Prisons keep track of

. prisoners’ arrivals and departures with

a white board, according to Syn.
Record-keeping is “one of the big-
gest obstacles facing the Magistrate
Sitting Program, although seemingly
simple to the American observer,”
Decker said. Last year, students gath-
ered information on prisoners and
their reasons for arrest, and put it in

mg court ﬁles and helping to develop
better record-keeping methods, in
addition to traveling to prisons. The
program “has the potential to make
a large impact,” Decker said. “The
Practicum gets stronger with each
semester as we develop stronger con-
nections in Liberia that, in turn, open

“The program has the potential to make a large im-

pact. The Pracitcum gets stronger with each semes-

ter as we develop stronger connections in Liberia

that open up new opportunites to further develop. ”

RYAN DECKER, Liberian law class coordinator

a format useful for the Ministry of
Justice.

This year, to work to reduce
prison overcrowding, students will
work with the newly created Magis-
trate Sitting Program, acting as judi-
cial clerks for the six magistrates in
Monrovia. Students will be organiz-

up new opportunities to further de-

‘ velop the"program.”

W&L Law also has programs in
Cambodia, Iraq and The Hague, ac-
cording to the law school web site.

Joe Wilson’s ungentlemanly attack on President Obama

South Carolina Congressman and W&L Alumnus Joe Wilson s ‘controversial outburst is analyzed by Dane Davis

By Dane Davls
surr warren

In the middle of what was
supposed to be the re-launch
of President Barack Obama’s
health insurance reform agenda,
a Congressman yelled out two
simple words that managed to
change the national discourse for
the next few weeks.

While stating that his health-
care plan does not cover undocu-
mented workers, Pres. Obama,
along with Speaker Nancy Pelosi
and Vice President Joe Biden
seated behind him, was clearly
shocked to hear and see Repre-
sentative Joe Wilson of South
Carolina point and yell, “You
Lie.”

This breach of decorum set off
a ﬂurry of sound and fury from
the pundit class. David Brooks
of the New York Times lamented
the “expressive individualism”
and “self-exposure” of today’s
“High Five Nation.”

Some, such as former Presi-
dent Jimmy Carter, took the out-
burst as an indicator of a deep
seated racial ‘resentment ﬁnally
bursting over because of a black
president. Others took to Rep.
Wilson’s defense, stating that the
insurance reform did in fact in-

clude illegals. Furthermore, they
argued, Britain’s parliament has
rancorous debate that anyone
who has access to C-SPAN can
witness.

The issue of whether or not
Obama actually lied is not that
important. Congress has since

barred non-residents from en-

Instead, there are two deeper

behavior. The ﬁrst is a broader
conversation over the appropri-

leaders, and ideology in a loud
and often cacophonous republic.

uals believe said viewpoints are
erroneous.

In a pluralistic democracy,
the clash of ideas is an essential
and necessary part of discerning
the public good. Since no man
has a monopoly on truth, free
discourse is required in order
that public reason may discern
what is proper and true, a point
eloquently made by John Stuart
Mill.

This idealistic belief must
be accompanied by certain be-

haviors that are shared by the
populace so that it may become
a reality. One such behavior is
toleration. Shouting, ﬁlibuster-
ing, and deceitful debate tactics
do nothing to advance the public
good. I

Viewing one’s intellectual
opponent not as someone with
whom you disagree but as some-
one who is malicious, evil, or
possessing maligned intentions
leads to a personal defensiveness
that incompatible with a true be-
lief in reason and an honest at-
tempt at the truth.

This quality is unfortunately
possessed by members of both
sides of our political spectrum.
Observe the cries of “Fascism!”
by made certain liberals during
the Bush years and repeated by
some of today’s conservatives.

That said, this trait is not new.
It is an ongoing tension that oc-
curs within the body politic and
even within individuals; a clash
between civility and the zeal of
which only ideological assured-
ness can produce.

Since it is present in all gov-
ernmental systems that allow
their citizens and politicians

to speak freely, it is not unique
to America or today’s society.
Television, the intemet, and
other forms of mass media may
exacerbate particular instances
of poor behavior, leading to the
overall impression of a decaying
society.

The United States has a long
tradition of libelous statements
made against presidents and
politicians, oftentimes made by
those within Congress.

We are fortunate that our cur-
rent disagreements are expressed
only in words. Congressional
history has many examples of
past ﬁghts on the ﬂoor of the
House and Senate. Pundits, and
those reading them, must be
careful not idealize the forgotten
past as a barometer or standard
for whatever is apparently lack-
ing in contemporary times.

While “You Lie!” is certainly
coarse and boorish, it does not
compare to more despicable
statements made by members of
Congress throughout the institu-
tion’s past.

How is all of this relevant to
the Washington and Lee commu-
nity? As a alumnus of W&L, J_oe

Omicron D elta Kappa was founded December 3, l9l4 at W&L
by 15 student and faculty leaders. The founders formulated the
idea that leadership of exceptional quality and versatility in
college should be recognized, that representatives'in all phases
of coll ege life should cooperate in worthwhile endeavors, and
that outstanding students, faculty, and administrators should
meet on a basis of mutual interest, understanding and helpful-
ness. ODK was the first college honor society ofa national
scope to give recognition and honor for meritorious leadership
and service in extracurricular activities and to encourage devel-
opment of general campus citizenship.

Trying to survive the student election cam“pains”

Law student Jordan Rothman takes a long, hard look at the current state of student elections

By Jordan Rothman
STAFF WRITER

I absolutely hate election sea-

No, I am not talking about
the national political landscape,
full of sound bytes, amorphous
phrases, and the like.

No, I am not even talking
about the state-wide campaigns,
which seem to be ﬂooding lawn
signs and television sets every-
where.

Actually, I am referring to the
electioneering that is happen-
ing right now on campus, and in
many regards this campaigning
is more repugnant than anything
that can be cooked up by profes-
sional politicians.

Over at the law school, and
soon on the undergraduate side,
people have been putting on
their phony faces, manufacturing
somewhat humorous signs, and
going from person to person like
traveling salesmen all trying to
garner people’s votes.

with ﬁyers, the gossip is all about
the candidates, and I can’t help
but wonder why the hell it all
matters in the ﬁrst place.

What I must ask these candi-

the prize of a simple title enough
to counteract the guilt you should
be feeling from selling yourself

I hope the point I am trying to
make is crystal clear.

As we can see in our own

ls Facebook real?

Wondering if people is F acebook proﬁles are really
an indicator of how they are as people

By Gozl Egbuonu
STAFF WRITER

As I sat in the Commons thinking about top-
ics to discuss in this article, I couldn’t help look-
ing back and forth between Microsoft Word and
my Facebook proﬁle.

I found myself just sitting and watching the
homepage as the status updates refreshed or as
I got notiﬁcations of interesting things like new
quizzes to waste my time taking, new photo
albums in which I am tagged, or the union or
break-up of the infamous and all too popular
Facebook couples.

At that moment, I knew what I had to discuss
with you, my fellow Generals: the question of
whether or not F acebook is real.

In my opinion, I have found that most peo-
ple use Facebook more as a means to create a
more exciting or interesting version of their real
lives.

I bet you’re wondering how I came to this
conclusion. Well, it is rather simple and I will
attempt to explain my observation in two simple
parts: 1. The Photos and 2. The Wall Posts.

Our Facebook photos are the clearest way
to really relay our so-called “real” lives to our
friends and family. Thus, I thought it would be
the best choice to begin with an explanation of

doing something. I have once, in a serious bout
with boredom, looked through a Facebook pro-
ﬁle purely created to make the individual’s life
seem much more exciting that it actually was,
only to ﬁnd an album in which all of the pictures
were of people posing.

And speaking of friends, the friendly Face-
book wall posts are another way in which peo-
ple try to create an image of themselves that
drastically differs from their actual lives. Now,
I will admit that I blow up people’s wall posts,
but for the most part, those people are actually
my really good friends.

Nothing makes me scratch my head more
than when I get a newsfeed of someone writing
on another person’s wall when I know for a fact
that (a) they are not really friends and (b) they
probably do not even like each other.

I mean why else would one waste time
writing on another person’s wall, whom they
clearly do not like, unless it was to create an
image for outsiders that says, “Hey, look! I have
friends?”

I hate to sound like I am bashing Facebook
users, because I am not. I have committed of-
fenses on F acebook that would greatly displease

What I don ’t get about people who manufacture F acebook

lives is how they are able to ﬁnd that much time while they are

socializing to be taking so many pictures. Do you stop in the

middle of yourshenanigans and request that people take pic-

tures ?

how some people manufacture a “cooler” life
via Facebook.

For example, one’s F acebook proﬁle picture
is often a picture that either shows others that
you are attractive, have friends or are the quint-
essential emo, prepster, hipster, athlete, thug,
or all around fool. People go to great lengths to
ensure that the proﬁle picture they choose falls
into one of those categories.

You don’t even have to question my point
here. Just look at the proﬁle picture of any of
your friends. Does it fall into one of those cat-
egories?

What I don’t get about the people who man-
ufacture F acebook lives is how they are able to
ﬁnd that much time while they are socializing
to be taking so many pictures. Do you stop in
the middle of your shenanigans and request that
people take pictures? The clear difference be-
tween manufactured social lives presented in
picture form and real ones are what the people
in the images are doing.

Yes, there are times at a social function where
you will stop and pose with your friends, but
when you are truly socializing, those pictures
will often have people in action——that means

my forefathers, but I just can’t deal with how
people are now using what used to be a site
that was solely expected to be used to unite old
friends in college and across the globe, but is in-
stead being used by some people as a means for
turning themselves into someone they clearly
are not.

Despite the aforementioned points, is creat-
ing an inﬂated or completely false social life re-
ally be all that terrible?

We live in a world that puts a great deal of
emphasis on the way you look, your personal-

Yummy! Lexington gets nutritious

Local resident starts new business despite down economy selling good-for-you smoothies and slim-down supplements

Project Horizon begins volunteer training

By Holly Suthers
STAFF WRITER

A new volunteer training ses-
sion will begin for Project Hori-
zon, the non-proﬁt organization
dedicated to reducing domestic,
dating, and sexual violence in the
Rockbridge County area.

The organization, which began
in 1982, provides a 24-hour hot-
line, housing, counseling and sup-
port for women and children.

Each year about 170 victims
take advantage of Project Hori-
zon’s services. Twelve full-time
staff members plus volunteers help
maintain a functional" and success-

’ ful organization. Many Washing-
ton and Lee students have partici-
pated since the group’s founding.

Training starts on Saturday and
will last until Oct. 3. Volunteers
must complete the 32 hours of
training in order to begin work.

_ The training sessions consist
of several workshops focusing on
domestic violence, sexual assault
and crisis intervention. Staff mem-
bers will talk about their roles, the
people that they serve and the ef-
fects the organization has on the

-community.

A session on domestic violence
and sexual assault in the gay popu-
lation, as well as a forum with the
Rockbridge County Sherrif’s De-
partment and the Lexington Po-
lice, is included.

While the training seems rigor-
ous, Project Horizon’s Volunteer
Coordinator Rebecca Hamilton
believes it’s important all volun-
teers understand how to react to
potential scenarios.

She thinks that once volunteers
begin working they understand
that the training was worthwhile.

“Volunteers need to know how
to respond to every possible situ-
ation and how to give the best in-
formation and advice to callers,”
Hamilton said.

She said that volunteers mostly
answer the hotline in the evening
hours, provide childcare to the
children of victims at the shel-
ter and help organize community
events. Volunteers are also re-
quired to maintain conﬁdentiality
of the safe shelter location and the
names and information of the vic-
tims. 0

Volunteers are asked to work
for at least six hours per month,

town’s newest addition, is a well-
ness club that promotes a healthy,
nutritious lifestyle.

but Hamilton said that most work
much more than the minimum re-
quirement.

Like most volunteers, junior
Kara Karcher primarily answers
the hotline at night and provides
crisis intervention for victims,
informs them about Project Hori-
zon’s services and also lends call-
ers an empathetic ear.

Karcher, who has volunteered
since the fall of 2008, believes
that she has become much more
educated about the serious issues
of domestic violence and sexual
assault. _ .

‘‘I feel fortunate that I have
been able to touch the lives of a
few women, whether it’s talking
to them on the phone during a ho-
tline call or visiting with residents
in the shelter,” said Karcher.

She encourages others to vol-
unteer and has been struck by how
many volunteers, many female,
give their time and energy to help
ensure the safety of other women
in the community.

And while Karcher said that it
has been emotionally challenging
to maintain appropriate boundar-
ies with victims while they di-
vulge such personal information,

she believes that it is completely _

worthwhile.

“Some of the stories will 1* ‘ak
your heart,” she said, “but it has
been eye-opening, challenging,
and so rewarding to have the op-
portunity to reach out to women in
our community.”

zon, contact Rebecca Hamilton

The shop opened its doors
Sept. 8, offering free wellness
evaluations

STEPHANIE HARDIMAN / Arts & Life Editor

to the wellness club, as well as
smoothies with complimentary
and membership herbal tea and herbal aloe.

Lexington Nutri-
tion is not a restau-
rant, although the
meal alternative
smoothies have
drawn in custom-
ers.

Owner and
Lexington resident
Richard
works in the shop
with his daughter,
making smoothies
and small talk, and
educating custom-
ers on the personal
wellness system,
Herbalife, that he
sells. Patrons may
also request free
wellness evalua-
tions and receive a
consultation specif-
ic to their body type
and lifestyle.

The store is
foremost a well-
ness club and dis-
tributor of Herbal-
ife products, said
Beagan. He started
the business out of
his home, provid-
ing tips on healthy

habits and samples

Beagan ’

of Herbalife products. Now the
shop allows him to continue his
distributorship on alarger scale.

Made with Herbalife nutri-
tional shake mixes, the smoothies
contain soy proteins, vitamins,
and ﬁber to balance the metabo-
lism. Customers receive a glass
of complimentary herbal tea and
a small cup of herbal aloe to sip
while their smoothies are made.
The lemon or raspberry herbal
tea contains antioxidants and an
energy boost, while the mango-
ﬂavored herbal aloe helps to aid
digestion.

Through the use of its phar-
maceutical-grade products, Los
Angeles-based Herbalife’s web
site reports that 60 million peo-
ple throughout the world have
lost weight. The products target
not only weight management but
sports, cellular and digestive nu-
trition.

Beagan said he looks for-
ward to furthering business and
promoting healthy lifestyles in
the area. He hopes to ﬁnd local
residents interested in’ becom-
ing wellness coaches, who he
would educate on the Herbalife
products and wellness program.
These coaches would then start
their own local ﬁtness programs.

There is also a weight loss
challenge in the works. For a $35
registration fee, 15 to 20 people

can participate in the competi-
tion, where they will learn about
topics such as heart health, ex-
ercise and the importance of
drinking water. The person who
loses the most weight will win
75 percent of the registration fee
money.

Beagan admitted that people
warned him he would face road-
blocks when opening a new busi-
ness in a down economy, but so
far things have gone smoothly,
he said. He has even acquired a
few regular customers.

While the Herbalife prod-
ucts are a bit pricey, the drink
mixes and powders make many
servings. The company’s sta-
tistics speak to the power of the
products, which suggest the in-
vestment is worth it for those
interested in a healthy lifestyle
change.

Even customers just looking
to check out the $5 smoothies
will ﬁnd themselves welcome
and wellness information avail-
able but by no means forced upon
them. The smoothies, made with
vanilla, chocolate, coffee or fruit
ﬂavors, are delicious, and perfect
as post-workout meals.

The friendly, comfortable
atmosphere of Lexington Nutri-
tion promises the presence of the
wellness club to be a positive
one.

 iMen’s tennis shines in ODAC tourney

During fall season opener, Generals take three out of four singles ﬂights in ODAC Singles Championships

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

After a disappointing 5-3 loss to
Hampden-Sydney in the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference Championship
match last year snapped Washington and
Lee’s string of 13 consecutive ODAC
titles, the Generals had a lot to prove as
they kicked off the 2009-2010 season.
And they didn’t disappoint.

Playing host to the ODAC Singles
Championship last weekend, the Gener-
als claimed the top place in three of the
four singles ﬂights.

“Last year was kind of a slap in the
face for us,” said sophomore Michael
Freeman, who competed in the No.

2 singles ﬂight for the Generals. “It
was really a wake-up call for us... We
wanted to make a statement to Hamp-
den-Sydney and show them that We’re
a better team this year. We want to show
them that losing to them last year was
just a ﬂuke.” ’

The winners of the three singles titles
never even lost a match and with all-
W&L match-ups in the No. 2, No. 3, and
No.4 ﬂights, the only real competition in

the tournament came from the Generals _ .

themselves.
“I think it speaks to the amount of
depth we have on our team,” said ﬁrst-

year Hayden White who competed in
the No. 1 singles ﬂight for the Generals.
“We’re a fairly young team. To have so
many players in the ﬁnals and the semi-
ﬁnals is just great.”

In the No. 2 singles bracket, Freeman ‘

put up a 4-0 record to swing his way
into ﬁrst place. Freeman defeated fellow
W&L player sophomore Jonathan Gaff-
ney 6-3, 6-2 in the ﬁnals.

“I struggled with my serve a little
bit,” Freeman said. “But I was able to
grind it out and win some big matches.”

In the No. 3 singles ﬂight, junior Will
Hall also went undefeated at 4-0 to claim

the top spot. Hall defeated W&L junior
Tad Hatcher 6-1, 6-1 in the ﬁnals.

In the No. 4 singles ﬂight, sophomore
Brian Roberts defeated junior Morgan
Hopson 6-2, 6-2 to take ﬁrst place. The
championship victory gave Roberts an
undefeated 4-0 record as well.

White was the only W&L player who
didn’t have to battle his teammates in
the ﬁnals: He faced off against Hamp-
den-Sydney’s Will Moss in the champi-
onships of the No. 1 singles ﬂight. Moss,
the 2009 ODAC Player of the Year, de-
feated White 6-3, 6-4. White ﬁnished
the tournament with a 3-1 record.

Volleyball crushes Marlins, falls to

Generals bounce back from Wednesday ODAC loss to go 1-1 in weekend home matches

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee women’s
volleyball team (2-5, 1-1 ODAC) re-
turned to action Saturday at the Warner

Center, defeating Virginia Wesleyan 3-

0, but losing a nail-biter to Gettysburg
3-2. The team has endured a rocky
ﬁrst week, dropping four of its ﬁrst ﬁve
matches and losing a conference match
for the ﬁrst time since 2007. y

“We changed a lot of technical and
tactical stuff this year,” said Head Coach
Brian Snyder of the team’s slow start.
“It’s a lot of new ideas on defense and it
is simply notphabit yet for the girls. lt’s a
tough adjustment.”

The ladies showed the potential of
this year’s team during their ﬁrst match

on Saturday. After seeing their 19-game
conference winning streak snapped on
Wednesday to Randolph-Macon, the
Generals were out for vengeance against
a team to which they have never before
lost. The squad set the tone early against
the Marlins, taking the ﬁrst game 25-
18. Unfortunately for the Marlins, that
would be the closest they would get to
tasting victory as the Generals closed
out the match by winning 25-17, 25-17.

The straight set win over an ODAC
rival proved that the Generals are not
going away this year. Senior leadership
prevailed in this well-played contest
as outside hitters Rachael Phillips and
Kelly Harrison combined for 19 kills,

while Harrison added 12 digs. Senior
setter Megan Steinhardt also ﬁlled up
the stat sheet by tallying 33 assists. lu-
nior middle blocker Louise Brooks had
a nice day of her own, clocking in 10
kills and 5 digs.

After watching Virginia Wesleyan
play Gettysburg, the Generals got ready
to play the second match of their dou-
bleheader. W&L has neverwon against
Gettysburg in school history. Snyder
encouraged the team by telling them
that “none of that matters.” The ladies
rode the momentum of the morning’s
win as far as they could, taking the ﬁrst
game from the Gettysburg Bullets by a
score of 25-19. Gettysburg immediately

responded with a 25-18 win of their
own in the second set. The back-and-
forth affair continued with W&L taking
set number three 25-22, and Gettysburg
answering again with a 25-21 win in set
four. The tiebreaking ﬁfth set saw W&L
come within two points of closing it out
for the win at 13-11, but the Bullets
scored four straight points to end it and
win the set 15-13, and the match 3-2.
Phillips and Brooks continued their
stellar offensive play with 14 and 18
kills respectively, while Phillips also
chipped in 16 digs. Freshman libero
Cameron Hill also recorded 22 digs.

an astounding 51 assists. But while the

“The Hampden-Sydney No. 1 is just
a strong player,” White said. “He’s the
best player in the ODAC. We’re just
trying to improve as much as we can
so hopefully in the spring a Washington
and Lee player will be named the best
player.” I

The Generals will look to continue
their strong play as they head to the Uni-
versity of Mary Washington on October
3 to compete in the ITA Regional Tour-
nament.

Bullets

stats look good, W&L was not able to
close out Gettysburg.

“There were deﬁnitely a lot of good
things today and a lot of improvement
from Wednesday night” against Ran-
dolph-Macon, Snyder said. “However,
our play was very up-and-down and we
shot ourselves in the foot with unforced
errors.”

The team travels to Eastern Men-
nonite on Tuesday for another ODAC
conference match. Its next home game
is October 3 against the University of
Mary Washington.

Miscues doom Generals in overtime loss

Washington and Lee falls to Greensboro 26-20 after overtime fumble; record drops to 1-2

By Lee Tackett
surr wmren

An overtime fumble, two missed ﬁeld
goals (one blocked) and a blocked extra
point kept the Washington and Lee Gen-
erals (1-2) from victory Saturday as they
fell to the Greensboro College Pride in
overtime 26-20. The Generals were ef-
fective at using their option-based rush-
ing attack throughout the game, rush-
ing for 322 yards as a team. But W&L
struggled to account for the athleticism
of Greensboro’s wide receivers, surren-
dering 280 yards through the air.

It took both teams a quarter to get

' into their offensive rhythms, but scor-

ing was non-stop in the second quar-
ter. Sophomore running back Jonathan
Clemo was able to break the ice with an
8-yard touchdown run to put the Gener-
als up 7-0. Greensboro would answer on
the following drive, as quarterback Mike

Caparaso found Brandon Richardson to
tie the game at 7-7.

But W&L wasted no time taking
back the lead. The Generals ran the ball
on eight of nine plays, using four differ-
ent rushers, and capped the drive with
an 18-yard touchdown run by another
sophomore running back Harrison Hud-
son. Despite their success on the ground,
the Generals’ defense struggled to slow
the Greensboro passing attack. Caparaso
found receiver Nathan Scott three times
on the next drive, with the ﬁnal pass be-
ing a 15-yard touchdown.

Greensboro- struggled with special
team miscues, failing to tie the game af-
ter a missed extra point. The Generals

attempted to raise their lead at the end of _

the half, but were unable to convert on
a ﬁeld goal attempt, leaving them ahead

14-13 at halftime.

The Generals elected to keep the ball
on the ground for most of the second
half. But their ﬁrst drive ended in a failed
fourth down conversion and the second
on a blocked ﬁeld goal. The W&L de-
fense shut down the Greensboro attack,
but a W&L ﬁimble allowed Greensboro
to start a drive deep into W&L territory.
A strong defensive effort by linebackers
sophomore Rob Look and senior David
Love shut down the Greensboro drive.

“They had run a similar play before
and 1 was justtrying to run down hill
and ﬁll the gap,” said Look.

The Generals’ offense had a produc-
tive drive to carry them into the fourth
quarter, but another fumble stopped
the drive. After the defense stood tall
for two more drives, stopping another

Greensboro fourth down conversion at- ‘

tempt, the Generals’ offense was ﬁnally
able to break through again. The Gen-
erals ran the ball four times and Clemo
found the end zone for the second time.
A missed extra point put the Generals
ahead at only 20-13.

With 1:30 left to play, Greensboro
drove the length of the ﬁeld and Ca-
paraso connected with Antwan Thorpe
to send the game into overtime with the
score tied at 20-20.

Greensboro continued their momen-
tum into the overtime, taking the lead
at 26-20. A missed extra point put the
Generals back in a position to win the
game, but a fumbled exchange between
sophomore quarterback Charlie Westfal
and ﬁrst-year running back Brett Mur-
ray was recovered by Greensboro to end

the game.

The Generals turned in a great perfor-
mance on the ground, with three rushing
touchdowns and three players rushing
for over 70 yards.

“It was deﬁnitely the most success‘

we’ve had running the ball this year”
said sophomore tackle John Fitzgib-
bons. “However, despite our ability to
move the ball, we couldn’t quite ﬁnish
drives. “

The Generals outgained the Pride by
almost 100 yards, but their three fum-
bles, two inside Greensboro territory,
kept the Generals from putting the game
away. The Generals travel to Averett
next Saturday, September 26, for their
ﬁrst road game of the season.

W&L soccer remains undefeated

Generals dominate Virginia Wesleyan 4-]; improve to 4-0 overall, 2-0 in ODAC

By Adam Cancryn
STAFF warren

Midﬁelder Ainsley Daigle’s three-goal
day propelled W&L’s women’s soccer-

team to a 4-1 win over Virginia Wesleyan
on Saturday.

Starting for the ﬁrst time as a General,
the ﬁrst-year made an immediate impact,
striking twice in the ﬁrst half. She capped
off her sparkling debut in the 68th minute,
scoring from 18 yards out and completing
the hat trick.

It was Daigle’s ﬁrst collegiate hat trick
and gives her four goals on the season.

“Funny enough, this was the ﬁrst game
she started,” head coach Neil Cunningham
said. “It was a coming out party.”

W&L was ‘able to put pressure on Vir-
ginia Wesleyan’s defense from the outset,
controlling possession with crisp passing
and long sideline runs. _

The hard work paid off in the 27th min-
ute when Daigle corralled a loose ball in
the box, faked out the keeper and slid it
into the net.

“It was just kind of one-on-one with
the keeper and I just passed it” into the

goal, she said.

Energized by the lead, the Generals
used their speed to work the ball deep into
Virginia Wesleyan territory. Keeping the
ball around the goalmouth, W&L extend-
ed its advantage when a turnover allowed
Daigle to net her second goal in less than
ten minutes.

Virginia Welseyan responded shortly
after halftime, but Daigle’s third goal put
the game away.

The win was the Generals’ ﬁrst over
Virginia Wesleyan since 2004, a fact Cun-
ningham said made the victory even more
special.

“No one on this squad’s ever beaten
them,” he said. “It’s just nice because
it’s a benchmark, because they’re always
good and they’re always ranked, so to
beat them and to beat them comfortably
was really important to us.”

Though the winning margin was com-
fortable enough, the scene on the ﬁeld was
another story. Virginia Wesleyan played
physically the entire match to counter
W&L’s speed.

“They said it was going to be a tough
game,” said Daigle. “We came in with
the mentality that we were going to get
pushed around, but we just had to play our
game and get over it.”

Virginia Wesleyan racked up 17 fouls,
three yellow cards and one red card. The
ejection came, when a Marlins’ defender
took down sophomore forward Allie Espi-
na during a breakaway. The ensuing pen-
alty shot was blocked, but senior captain

. Maggie Sutherland put away the rebound

to make it 4-1.

The win pushes the Generals to 4-0
overall and 2-0 in the ODAC, an excellent
start for a young team that has lost a num-
ber of key players. Top scorer Anne Van
Devender, defender Marisa Van Brunt and
goalie Kiki Moreo all graduated last year.
But that has not slowed the team, thanks to
its depth and the strong early play of ﬁrst-
years Daigle and Hannah Sackﬁeld.

The nice thing is that we had a good
group of ﬁrst-years last year, and they’ve

 

played,” Cunningham said. “That one year
makes a big difference.” _

He pointed especially to the improve-
ment of sophomore defender Corinne
Smith and keeper Emily O’Leary.

“Corrine has really matured at the back,
and Emily has really changed what we can
do,” he said.

The solid defense has allowed W&L to

utilize all of its offensive weapons. Espina
and fellow sophomore forward Kat Barnes
have combined to record 12 points in just
four games, including three goals and an
assist in Wednesday’s 10-0 dismantling of
Sweet Briar. Sackﬁeld also scored twice in
that game.

The Generals will look to continue their
undefeated record as they take on Hollins
on Tuesday.

this year as the school played host to the
Rockbridge Rapids baseball team. ‘

The Rockbridge Rapids became the
twelfth team in the Valley Baseball League
with their inaugural season this year. The
other member teams come from cities
around the area including Covington, Fau-
quier County, Front Royal, Harrisonburg,
Staunton, and Woodstock. The league is
one of eight summer baseball leagues in
the country that provides regular compe-
tition for collegiate players. All members
must have completed at least one year of
college and still have some remaining eli-

gibility. Tagged the “Gateway to .the Ma-
jors,” the league is known for the large
number of ‘graduates’ who go on to play

- professional baseball.

Battling against frequent rain delays,
the Rapids ﬁnished the season with a dis-
appointing 9-33 record. Their record put

them in last place in the league, but for the ,
team’s organizers and promoters, the inau-

gural season was still a massive success.
The stated mission for the Rockbridge
Baseball Club is “to provide competitive,
exciting college baseball in a wholesome
fun family atmosphere for the enjoyment
of the people of Rockbridge County, Lex-
ington, and Buena Vista.” And with a total
fan turnout of 7,000 for the season, the

Rockbridge Rapids seem to have done just
that.

“Through the rain-outs and lightning
delays and bad pitching, our local fans
we’re absolutely wonderful,” said Ken
Newman, general manger for the Rapids.
“We averaged almost 350 fans a game and
that ranked us ﬁfth in the l2-team Valley

League. F or our ﬁrst year, we really think _

that shows how much the "community en-
joys summer evening baseball.”

Building off their positive impact on
the community, the Rockbridge Rapids
will be looking to make a greater competi-
tive impact on league play when they re-
turn to action next summer.

, New federal

policy sends
shock waves

Students convicted of drug
possesion couldlose federal
ﬁnancial aid

By Frank cullo
smrr wrunzn

Some students may have been startled two
weeks ago when they received an inbox message
detailing a new federal policy on drug usage that
affects federal ﬁnancial aid. Students convicted of
either possessing or dealing illicit drugs are liable
to lose any form of federal ﬁnancial aid. Drugs
have never really taken the forefront of issues at
Washington and Lee. Alcohol and gender rela-
tions, yes, but not drugs.

Students have little reason to be alarmed. The
new policy is not a university one, but mandated
by the government. Furthermore, the policy only
deals with forms of federal ﬁnancial aid, such as
Federal Student Loans, Federal PLUS Loans, Fed-
eral Grants and even Federal Work Study, but not
university loans.

According to the Financial Aid ofﬁce, about
65 percent of the student body is on some form
of ﬁnancial aid. They do not release what type of
aid students are receiving, however, so that only
provides some reﬂection of what percentage of the
student body is affected‘ by this new policy.

The government is not preoccupied by univer-
sity infractions. If a student is cited on campus
for any type of drug violation, it is still handle in-
ternally in compliance with Virginia and federal
laws. The university is not required to report these
violations on behalf of the recipient of federal ﬁ-
nancial aid to the body that oversees it.

The only type of drug violation that activates
this policy is a court conviction of a drug posses-
sion or dealing charge. In this situation a student
is likely to lose one year of federal ﬁnancial aid
for possessing and two for dealing, with additional
time padded on for secondary violations.

Take heart, however, because even if a W&L
student ﬁnds himself or herself in this predica-
ment, it is possible to receive federal ﬁnancial aid
again before the one-year term is up. With suc-
cessful completion of a Title IV drug rehabilita-
tion program and by successfully passing two un-
announced drug tests, a student can again receive
aid from the government.

There is no new university equivalent for with-
holding aid to drug users. The university has its
own policies in place with regards to the strike
system when it comes to drug violations on cam-
pus. Even so, most publications about problems
on campus almost never deal with drugs, most
likely because beside the occasional dorm bust
drug problems are not very prevalent on campus.

Associate Dean Brandon Dotson does not fore-
see this new policy being a problem for W&L stu-
dents.. In fact, in his four-year tenure at the univer-
sity there has not been a single conviction in court
of a W&L student with regards to drugs. He sees
the policy as the federal government “taking a pro-
active step to curtail drug usage among students.”

In the fateful war on drugs this is just another
non-issue in the way of combating the real dangers
among drug usage in the country. For W&L stu-
dents, however, whether on federal ﬁnancial aid or
not this new policy should not be anything more
than another email in the inbox.

Goodbye, University Scholars?

After undergoing academic review last winter term, the program may be disbanded

By Mary Huerster
STAFF WRITER

The University Scholars program,
an academic honors program within
the Washington and Lee community,
may be discontinued in its_present
form in the upcoming academic year.

A review process was initiated
last winter term, and while the ofﬁ—
cial ﬁndings of the committee (four
faculty members chaired by Profes-
sor William of the Physics Depart-
ment) have not yet been released, the
report is expected within the next few
weeks.

There is a sufﬁcient likelihood
that it will be disbanded, but Dean of
the College Hank Dobin has assured
current Scholars that they will be able

'to graduate with University Scholars

honors even if the program is phased
out before that time, to which end he
has offered to serve as their advisor.

Dobin explained that the program
came under review during winter
term of last year as part of a routine
process to which all academic pro-
grams are periodically subjected.

Such reviews have essentially a
dual purpose: to ascertain whether or
not a program still fulﬁlls its origi-
nal purposes and goals, and whether
or not those goals are still relevant
given changes that have taken place
in the University since the program’s
founding.

In the case of the University
Scholars, this was in 1984.

These goals, as identiﬁed in the
University Scholars constitution, are
to “encourage active rather than pas-
sive forms of learning, to emphasize
interdisciplinary studies, and to facil-
itate opportunity for discourse among
our most prepared students.”

Current University Scholars make
it clear that the program is, as far as
they are concerned, more than fulﬁll-
ing its objectives. Senior Emily Coyle,
who was featured in last week’s edi-

tion of the Ring-tum Phi for the sex-
ual assault prevention workshop she
designed via the University Scholars
Program, gave an example from her
own experience. ‘

“The University Scholars program
has taught me that the best way to ap-
proach a question is from a variety
of angles,” she said. “[It] was what
I learned in [a University Scholars
class] that will impact the rest of my
career.

thesis or capstone project required for
graduation from the Program.

O’Brien mentioned that the Uni-
versity Scholars program takes care
to seek out students willing to com-
plete all aspects of the program dur-
ing their recruitment process.

However, he said, even among
this self-selected group many ﬁnd
themselves too busy or otherwise re-
luctant to devote the time necessary
to this major undertaking.

“The University Scholars program has taught me

that the best way to approach a question is from a

variety of angles... Whatl learned in [a University

Scholars class] will impact the rest of my career. ’

EMILY COYLE, senlor University Scholar

“I am presently applying to de-
velopmental psychology phD pro-
grams, in large part because of an
interest sparked in me by a Univer-
sity Scholars anthropology course
my sophomore year. If that does not
embody the 1I‘llSSl011 of the University
Scholars program, I’m not sure what
does.”

One signiﬁcant concern about the
program, however, is itslow comple-
tion rate. Dobin mentioned that this
was a serious issue the faculty coin-
mittee came upon during the review
process.

According to University Scholars
President Elliott O’Brien, the schol-
ars themselves had been aware of and
concerned about the low completion
rate well before the review board.
Both he and Coyle suggested that the
main reason for this was the senior

Another troubling issue for mem-
bers of the program—though not
necessarily for the review committee
——has been its small size, which is a
double-edged sword.

While it allows for a closer feeling
of community than would otherwise
be possible, the program’s conse-
quent exclusivity is an unfortunate
side effect,

O’Brien said that one of the most
difﬁcult responsibilities of his role as
president is serving on the student-
run committee for admission into the
program. Out of about 200 students
(almost half a graduating class) with
the minimum qualifying GPA of 3.5,
he said, the program can take approx-
imately forty.

Harder still is the realization that
some students who do not meet the
GPA requirement would nevertheless

have been worthy additions to the

. program.

O’Brien remembered in particu-
lar a student who was not invited to
apply because a difﬁcult transition
to college had lowered his GPA, but
went on to become one of the most
successful students in his class.

Non-University Scholars are free
to take UNIV-designated classes
(classes approved for University
Scholars credit), but are not truly part
of the program community.

The main objection of the faculty
review board, however, was that as
W&L has grown as an institution
since 1984, the program has become
increasingly less necessary.

“Developments over time-such
as the creation of many interdisci-
plinary programs and the newer First-
Year Seminar program, a much ex-
panded and more varied curriculum
across the departments and programs,
and the [many] new and innovative
courses being designed for the new
spring term fulﬁll many of those
original goals,” said Dobin.

Dobin was very clear that, no
matter what the future of the Program
assuch, the University will continue
to support its goals of interdisciplin-
my study and “fostering a sense of
intellectual community.”

Local correctional center closed

Budget cuts cause loss of jobs, relocation of juveniles and costs W&L an outreach program

By Vergll Parson
s TA F F w R IT E R

The closing of Natural Bridge
Juvenile Correctional Center will
cost Rockbridge county a hundred
jobs, relocate dozens of kids to much
harsher facilities and lose Washing-
ton and Lee a fruitful outreach.

In an attempt to make up a budget
shortfall of 1.35 billion dollars, Gov.
Tim Kaine’s ofﬁce released a plan de-
tailing cuts and belt-tightening mea-
sures. Among these is the closing of
Natural Bridge Juvenile Correctional
Center (NBJCC). The plan states that
savings will total 1.2 million dollars
and result in 68 layoffs.

Bridge, the jobs lost will total 101.
This blow comes to an area already
hit severely by the current economic
downturn. The county stands to lose
more than the state stands to gain.

By all accounts, Natural Bridge
has one of the lowest rates of recidi-
vism. The facility, the only fenceless
correctional center in the area, acts
as the reward for good behavior and
a clearer glimpse of what life on the
outside will be like.

“I worry about what will happen
to many of the residents when they
are transferred to more high-secu-

“Natural Bridge Juvenile Correctional Center had

a great staff and did a lot of work to insure that resi-

dents never re—entered the system. Once this facility

is gone, I wonder who is going to step up and offer

opportunities for youth who truly want to reform. ’

ERIC HAMSCHER, junior and former tutor at NBJCC

However, the Rockbridge County
Board of Supervisors issued a state-
ment pointing out that the staff at NB-
ICC won’t be the only ones affected.
When including the auxiliary agen-
cies that provide services to Natural

rity facilities,” said W&L junior Eric
Hamscher, who tutored at NBJCC. “I
don’t think that they will get as much
help with pursuing schoolwork and
other activities that help reduce the
risk of re-offending upon being re-

leased.”

A currentresident of NBJ CC who
is working with Campus Kitchen
echoed Hamscher’s statement, say-
ing, “I don’t understand anything
about what they’re doing.” He said
the program shows what life outside
the system is like and then “[they]
pull it all away.” -

Most of the kids at NBJCC have
spent time at other facilities. Natural
Bridge works to maintain an atmo-
sphere far removed from the gangs
and violence of those other correc-
tional facilities; The young man men-
tioned above recounted being called
into an assembly on September 8 and
listening as correctional oﬂicers in-
formed the populace that they would
all be leaving in a few weeks.

Many consider the closing of
NBJCC a bad idea because NBJCC
makes a difference. Natural Bridge
has a program in which it sends
residents out to work at various jobs
around the county. It has sent two
interns to W&L’s Campus Kitchen.
Both of these young men plan on
coming back to Lexington in the fu-
ture.

Campus Kitchen has been very
beneﬁcial, both in providing thou-
sands of pounds of food to the Rock-
bridge area and introducing these two
young men to rewarding, fulﬁlling

work.

“This is one of the best things I
could’ve done,” said the young man
mentioned above. “They could’ve
put me in McDonald’s. I’m just wait-
ing 69 days, and then I come back
here.” ,

W&L did its part as well in help-
ing the NBJCC. The Bonner Leaders
program routinely sent students to tu-
tor in SAT, ACT, or GED prep, and
with class work.

One of the NBJCC’s key tools is
education~or, in their words, “to
provide a full range of services for
all wards to better prepare them for
their return to high school, college or
employment.”

Apart from the extent of the eco-
nomic detriment Rockbridge County
will suffer, one has to wonder what
will become of the population of
Virginia juvenile offenders who will
now sink back into the system.

As Hamscher said, “NBJCC had
a great staff and did a lot of work
to insure that residents never re—en-
tered the system. Once this facility is
gone, I wonder who’s going to step
up and offer opportunities for youth
who truly want to reform. In fact, I
worry that no one will be able to ﬁll
that void.”

Learning to live with the women’s rugby team

As a new and surprisingly succ

By Stockton Bullltt
OPINIONS EDITOR

I have to start with a dis-
claimer. Yes, I am a member of
the rugby team, and, yes, I am
inherently biased towards this
subject matter.

However, it’s late September,
which means the fourth ﬂoor of
Graham-Lees hasn’t been men-
tioned nearly enough to be noto-
rious yet.

Also, the school has blocked

at the end of Spring Term last
year, and I was not only sur-
prised by the turnout, but rather
impressed.

On only ‘a couple of weeks
notice, the girls already seemed
ready to ﬁeld a team. But again,
I’m talking aboutVMI. That is to
be expected. I mean, these girls
enjoy shooting guns at targets in
the woods. Why wouldn’t they

guys from the Michael Jordan
movie you saw when you were
six.

The girls I imagined would be
oversized, probably have about
four too many piercings, and
would threaten to take my lunch
money if I did not get out of their
way. Basically, I thought they
would be the bench of a WNBA
basketball team.

How many other clubs here were anywhere close to having this kind

of success when they started? Can the Ultimate Frisbee team, a club

with a much longer history, boast this kind of schedule and stability?
 

the CoIlegeACB website (“pend-
ing an internal investigation,”
right...), so I don’t exactly have
anything juicy enough to ap-
ply to our campus at this given

. time. Instead, I am going to write

something that I want to write
about.

At the end of last Spring, VMI
decided to add a women’s rugby
team to their club repertoire. This
made plenty of sense for two rea-
sons: it helps fulﬁll their Title IX
requirements, and the girls who
willingly attend VMI without
playing a varsity sport probably
feel ready to hit someone.

I saw the girls’ team practice

enjoy beating the crap out of
other girls?

Before school started, the
W&L Rugby coach, Tom Lovell,
talked about trying to recruit
some girls to join in with the
VMI women’s rugby team. I,
like most of the other guys who
I talked to, responded by saying,
“Look, I’m down with the whole
Women’s Lib thing, but you will
never get any girl here to play
rugby. Period.”

When I think of women’s
rugby, I tend to imagine the
Monstars from “Space Jam.” For

' those of you with lives, those
were the animated monster bad

The perception I had of most
women at W&L was pretty much
the polar opposite of my percep-
tion of women’s rugby players.

Because I am deathly afraid
of getting tarred and feathered
by the Women’s Studies depart-
ment, let me say from the onset

that both these preconceptions

are false, and I have since seen
the error in my ways.

Anyway, I thought that girls at
W&L would neither want to hit
each other, nor would they want
to get too dirty. Obviously, these
preconceptions were blatantly
false, which is readily apparent to

I anyone who has attended the sto-

ried powder-puff football games
played every Spring Term.

At club sign ups in early Sep-
tember, I was stunned to see how
many girls stopped by the rugby
table and signed up to play.

For every guy making sure
his boys saw him sign up, there
was a girl right there behind him,

‘pen in hand.

Fine, I thought, there were
girls with too much time on their
hands, and they thought it’d be
cute to try a club sport. Or may-
be they saw some dashing young

rugby player who they read

about in the school newspaper
and thought that by signing up,
they would have a chance to win
his affections. Or maybe I was
completely wrong about those
last two assumptions.

With the astonishing number
of signups for the women’s rugby
team, there were enough players
to ﬁeld an entirely seperate team
for W&L, instead of just adding
to the VMI women’s roster.

On the ﬁrst day of practice,
more than 15 girls showed up
ready to play. Since they started
practicing about a week ago, not
only has their attendance been
outstanding, but their dedication
to practice has been also been
commendable.

When most of the men’s
players, including myself, are
bent over trying to catch their

‘women’s

collective breath and regretting
that seventh Natty from the night
before, the girls are effortlessly
running Indian sprints around
the ﬁeld.

The team is now large enough
to try and enter into two major
tournaments in the spring, and it
looks like they can not only enter
but also do quite well, despite the
fact that none of them have ever
played rugby before.

Being able to ﬁeld a team with
no previous experience and only
a couple of months of practice
before a national tournament?
Even Emilio Estevez had Charlie
Conway when he coached Dis-
trict Five to a championship over
the Hawks. And, yes, that is two
15-year-old kids’ movie refer-
ences and counting so far.

But here’s the important thing
about the advent of the W&L
rugby team. They
should not be revered for be-
ing brave, strong, courageous,
dangerous or any other speciﬁc
adjective. This is not WUSA or
the WNBA or even “A League
of Their Own.” They are not the
sorority in “The House Bunny”
bravely ﬁghting for attention
against the evil blondes.

In fact, their accomplishment
isn’t really movie quality. Lud-
acris is not going to narrate their
documentary, as he did with the
documentary “The Heart of the

essful club on campus, the W&L women is rugby team has deﬁed expectations

Game.”

They have achieved a feat
much_more important and spec-
tacular.

They have created a fully ca-
pable sports team out of thin air.

They have a reliable practice
schedule, a consistent turnout
and an unparalleled enthusiasm
for the game. How many other
clubs here were anywhere close
to having this kind of success
when they started? Can the U1-
timate Frisbee team, a club with
a much longer history, boast this
kind of schedule and stability?

These girls aren’t by any
means the Monstars. I would go
on further describing how dif-
ferent they really are physically
from the Monstars, but my law-
yers advise me to do otherwise.

These are just normal col-
lege students forming a stable,
attended club, and that is their
true accomplishment. They have
altered my and others’ miscon-
ceptions of the sport not through
conferences, rallies, O-Week en-
lightenment sessions or anything
else like that.

Instead, the women’s rugby
club triumphed in the most bor-
ing and unheralded way pos-
sible.

They signed up.

The loss of the barrier in the BDG
Quad is an absolute travesty

A first—year shares his outrage at the demolition of the ﬂowered barrier

By Keaton Fletcher
c o L o M N I sr

If you have been anywhere
near the quad within the past
week, you may have noticed
a rather troublesome physical
change on our campus.

Earlier this week, many liv-
ing in Gilliam and Davis dormi-
tories woke up to the sound of a
bulldozer in the Quad knocking
down the small triangular barrier
containing an enjoyable flower-
ing bush.

Many students are at a loss
as to why this ideal sitting place
was demolished without no-
tice, at least for the most part.
I think it safe to assume that
the bush was not worth water-
ing, especially in comparison to
grass. Even so, Generals are not
mourning the loss of the plant
but rather the seating area.

Where else are we supposed

to sit and explain to our parents
that no, we are not getting in too
much trouble?

Where are we supposed to sit
and wait for our select friends
who have cars to come pick us
up?

Some might say that the two
benches provided on the side
walk are clearly ideal seating,
especially compared to a decrep-
it brick wall. But there are two
main problems that are already
noticeable about the new lack of
seating.

The ﬁrst problem is just that:
lack of seating. The other issue
is the proximity to the street.
Few students desire to sit next
to the street while having an in-
timate conversation or while try-
ing to arrange an interview for
an internship.

The semi-isolated feeling
that the old brick wall seating
provided was much preferable.

But, instead of reminiscing
in the years (or in ﬁrst-years’
cases weeks) gone by with ideal
seating in the quad, perhaps we
should look toward the future.

—Maybe the new triangle of
grass that has been planted, once
it takes root, could be host to
a new set of benches for more
comfortable and intimate seat-
ing. Or perhaps we could have
a more natural themed seating,
i.e., rocks or logs. ,

This _might be an idealistic
view of some wide-eyed fresh-
man, but isn’t this our campus?

If we care enough about the
loss of seating we should bring
this to the attention of admin-
istration. We have shown the

power of students in years prior
by making changes, such as a
shift toward local produce and
the institution of Campus Kitch-
ens.

If there is enough interest in
bringing change about on this
campus, we have the power to
do it.

Now, Generals, the only
question is having to sit on the
steps of Gilliam to simply have a
conversation awkward enough?
Do you feel so uneasy sitting
alone on a bench by the street at
midnight that you feel the need
to request a change?

If so, take control of your
situation and come up with an
incentive for administration to
give you what you want.

I Facebook, Twitter and the future of communication

F acebook and Twitter are now powerful entities in the Internet universe, but Jonathan Salm questions their legitimacy

By Jonathan Salm
STAFF‘ WRITER

With the rise of the social net-
work and interconnectivity on
the internet, a number of institu-
tions have come to dominate how
people communicate.

Friendster, MySpace and
Facebook all launched in suc-
cessive years from 2002 to 2004,
and the Internet was transformed
from a largely unorganized col-
lection of people, ideas and ar-
ticles to an interrelated forum
where these people, ideas and
articles could all be linked to-
gether.

Coupled with the rise of per-
sonal blogs, as well as websites
such as Wikipedia and Youtube,
the Internet entered its second
era formally beginning after the
dot-com bubble burst. The term
Web 2.0 was coined, ushering in
the era of the interconnected in-
ternet.

While both Friendster and
MySpace rose and fell in popu-
larity sequentially, Facebook
has come to dominate the social
networking scene, boasting over
200 million users——1argely due to
a clean, uncluttered interface, the
ability to easily share photos and
comments and the recently added
chat feature.

One of Facebook’s marquee

features is the ability to publish
a ‘status’ for all friends to see.
This status is a short message
that appears at the top of a user’s
page. What began as a question
of “What are you doing?” now
reads, “What’s on your mind?”
Basically, the status is a 160-
character micro-blog.

While yes, I do use Facebook,
and yes, I do occasionally pub-
lish a status for my friends to see,
I believe the Facebook status to
be more trouble than it’s worth.

Facebook’s strengths lie in
its innovative photo tagging fea-
ture as well as its ease in adding
friends. Both of these features
were marquees of the website

’when it ﬁrst launched. Being

able to connect with hundreds
(and thousands, for some) of
people while also being able to
cull through years of online pho-
tos lies within the heart of the
F acebook’s convenience.

HoweverubiquitousFacebook
is among students, young adults,
and recently—gasp—adults and
professionals, its status feature
invites a critical existential ex-
amination. Can 160 characters,
the same amount allowed in
one text message, truly describe
someone’s life?

I ﬁnd Facebook statuses to
be uninteresting, often point-

less, and somewhat disturbing.
When I log on to F acebook, I
don’t particularly care to know
that a recent graduate of my high
school is having a good enough
time at college to warrant inces-
santly quoting the Asher Roth hit
“I Love College.”

The essential issue with F ace-
book statuses has carried over
into the most recent, and possibly
most pointless way people com-
municate with the world—Twit-
ter. And boy, do I hate Twitter.

As Facebook came to surpass
both Friendster and MySpace a

seem, it is transforming the land-
scape of both online social net-
works and people’s daily com-
munication techniques.

Via text messages, instant
messages, and other web-based
applications ' (including, yes,
Facebook) users publish mes-
sages known as “tweets.” These
tweets can even be messages per-
sonalized to certain users via a
reply command, signed by @ and
followed by their usemame.

The existential dilemma with-
in Facebook’s status is the exact
same within Twitter—only twen-

few years ago, Twitter intends to
do the same to Facebook in the
next few years.

Launched in 2006, Twitter is
essentially Facebook’s status fea-
ture without Facebook’s photo
publishing, friend adding, wall
writing, applications, games, or
any other features.

And, most importantly maybe, does it matter?

I had a stark realization of how my Facebook per-
sona may make me appear to others one day in Oc-
tober of 2005. I was a sophomore at American Uni-
versity in Washington, DC. I was interviewing for an
internship at a prestigious DC think tank.

The lead interviewer took out a thin manila folder
and opened it. Inside I could see my application ma-
terials, writing sample, resume, et cetera. Then she
turned the pages over and I was horriﬁed at what she
had in her hand: a printed out copy of my Facebook

so of each day to 140 characters,
I refuse to be conﬁned to such a
limited paradigm.

Despite my aversion to Twit-
ter, it seems that it is here to
stay.

In fact, it is rapidly climb-
ing the social networking ech-
elon, intimidating Facebook
with its stripped—down simplic-
ity and minimalism. (Note that
Facebook’s own simplicity and
minimalism contributed to its
rise over rivals Friendster and
Myspace.)

From February 2008 to 2009,
Twitter’s user base grew over
1300 percent, whereas Face-
book’s grew nearly 230 percent.
While this may be attributed to
Twitter’s novelty and innovation
or simply the fact that Web 2.0ers
tend to gravitate to the newest
and hippest trends, it is nonethe-
less a poignant fact.

Just this week, Facebook
rolled out two new features in
response to Twitter’s rise. Face-
book’s own @ command mirrors
Twitter’s reply command (they
both even use the @ symbol).
Facebook also launched a new
“lite” version of the site meant for
emerging markets and those with
slower Internet connections.

Both social networks are im-
mensely popular, and because of

the interconnectivity bred out of

here to stay.

If Friendster and MySpace are
any example, each network has a
niche it can thrive on. Friendster
has the Asian market cornered,
and MySpace is still tops for mu-
sic.

Despite my aversion to the
Facebook status and Twitter as
a whole, I remain yet another
connected being—if only via
Facebook. What exactly does
this mean about the future of
online social networking, and
more broadly, communication as
a whole?

It seems that brief, bite-sized
communication is the way of the
future. This shift from face—to-
face communication to quicker
and more effective means is
nothing new.

Over the past hundred and
ﬁfty years, communication has
evolved from telegrams to wired
telephones to wireless telephones
to cell phones to email and ﬁnally
to online social networks such as
Facebook and Twitter.

This transformation repre-
sents a prime example of social
Darwinism—adapt or die out.

March of Dimes and local literacy projects.

Pi Beta Phi sorority and Phi Beta
Sigma fraternity challenged the
endurance of dancers Friday
night at their 3rd Annual Dance-
A-Thon in Elrod Commons.
Members of these two Greek
organizations sold tickets all over

for the March of Dimes and local
literacy efforts.

Zaq Lawal and Samara Fran-
cisco organized the event, and
said that they surpassed their goal
of raising $2,000 for these chari-
ties. Half of the money raised

of babies. In the past, the other
half has gone to buying books
for local elementary schools.

To be the champion, one must
dance all night long, and the last
person dancing is the winner. As
participants moved on the dance

ﬂoor, different styles of dances
came alive, while limbs became
weak.

“The only type of dancing not
allowed is ‘no dancing,”’ said
Lawal, Phi Beta Sigma presi-
dent.

All types of music were
played throughout the night;
however, the organizations de-
cided to put a special emphasis
on playing music from popu-
lar movies, dubbing the night’s
theme “Dancing with the Stars.”

According to Lawal, more
than 100 people came to the
event, making it a huge success
and the most proﬁtable dance-a-
thon yet.

Junior Susan Taylor, who
participated, said that the music
made the night.

“My favorite part was doing
the macarena to a Lady GaGa
song for entertainment,” said
Taylor.

First-place winner Sir—Koven
Glover and second-place winner
Sarah Kim both received a Fancy
Dress ticket, a combined value of
$120. The two danced from 8:00
Friday night to 5:30 Saturday
morning.

The idea of the dance-a-thon
began in 2007 when the two
groups wanted to do a fun, in-
novative fundraiser together.

included a T-shirt and a pair of
sunglasses.

Annual University day of
service kicks of on Saturday

By Stephanie Hardlman
ARTS & LIFE EDITOR

This weekend is the opportuni-
ty to give back to the community
students call home for four years.

Each year, dozens of students
spend a Saturday doing good for
the Rockbridge area and keeping
the memory of Jonathan Nabors
‘02 alive.

Students can sign up individu-
ally or in teams, and are assigned
a service project for the day.

“It’s a really great way to
show that our campus is devoted
to the community and that we're
not trapped in this W&L bubble,”
said Nabors Service League chair
Samara Francisco. “Rockbridge
County is a place we consider our
home, too.”

Nabors Service League mem-
bers spent last week in Elrod
Commons encouraging students
to sign up for the event or even
take the initiative to become a
team leader and recruit students
themselves.

Francisco, a senior, said this
year’s projects include clearing
trails at Boxerwood Gardens, re-
shelving books at the local library,
picking trash and debris at Panther
Falls and painting-related projects
throughout the county.

Team leader Christina Torres,
a junior, decided to ﬁeld a team
of Heinz Scholars, high-achiev-
ing minority students who receive
scholarships to rise above difficult
ﬁnancial circumstances.

Torres and her ﬁve teammates
are committed to completing two
group community service activi-
ties as part of their relationship
with Heinz.

“We've been given a great
opportunity and we need to give
back in some way,” Torres said.

About 135 students are signed
up now, Francisco said, and she
hopes more will choose to join the
cause this week. Many fraterni-
ties, sororities, athletic teams and
organizations have already orga-
nized volunteer teams.

Nabors Service League was
formed by the friends of Jonathan

Nabors in 1999. Nabors, a fresh-
man, and his sister were driving
back to Lexington from their home
in Birmingham, Ala., after winter
break when they were killed in a
car accident on I-81.

Nabors Service Day began that
year in his memory and, with the
help of his friends, became a stu-
dent volunteer organization that
works year-round to provide vol-
unteers.

“Sometimes you just have to
meet the person to understand
how exceptional he or she is,”
Nabors Service League organiz-
er Clairbome Taylor ’O2 wrote
upon the founding of the group.
“Jonathan’s love for this Univer-
sity and the Lexington community
was evident in the way he carried
himself. His presence truly bright-
ened a room and brought smiles to
people’s faces.”

Nabors’s parents return to Lex-
ington each year for the day of
service and are still active in the
University community.

“lt’s how the family has been
able to deal with their son's . ath
and still have a relationship with
the school,” Francisco said. “And
it reminds the University of the
greater point of the organization.”

Saturday at l p.m., the par-
ticipants will gather on Cannan
Green to hear the Nabors family
speak. After departing for their
individual projects, teams will
work until about 5 p.m and return
to campus for a picnic dinner and
reﬂection on the day.

The next Nabors Service
League event will be a Hallow-
een carnival on Oct. 29 that is
co-sponsored with the Lexington
Chamber of Commerce. It will
include pumpkin and face paint-
ing, games and candy for local
children.

Those interested in participat-
ing in Nabors Service Day can
register online at http://go.wlu.
edu/nabors or contact Samara
Francisco.

Commons living room.
also sold.

Lawal said he hopes, in the
future, for increased participa-
tion so it is even more fun. He
foresees more rafﬂe prizes and a
larger location, such as the gym
or the pavilion.

Lawal said that the best part

of organizing this fundraiser was
“seeing all the planning and hard
work come to fruition and know-
ing that people are having a great
time and enjoying themselves.”

Generals give fall preview in lax classic

The Washington and L_ee Men is Lacrosse team will compete against VMI in the 23rd Annual Lee—Jackson Lacrosse Classic .

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

The Generals’ lacrosse sticks have
been patiently waiting out the summer

in closets and gym bags. But now it’s

time for fall ball and those sticks, eager
for the taste of new turf and the jolt of
a well-placed check, are ready to prove
they’re worth their aluminum.

The. Washington and Lee men’s la-

_crosse team will compete against the

Virginia Military Institute in the 23rd
Annual Lee-Jackson Lacrosse Classic
this Friday at 7:30 pm. on Wilson Field.

The game will mark the ﬁrst contest 0

for the Generals since their loss to Get-

tysburg in the NCAA tournament last

spring put an end to their l6-4 season.
The storied match—up against Division I
VMI has traditionally been held in the
spring, but three years ago, organizers

moved the event to the fall.

“It’s very difﬁcult to ﬁnd time to
schedule a game like this in the spring,”
said W&L head coach Gene McCabe.
“Now it can be a stand-alone event. We
can really build it up in the community
and have a nice long—standing rivalry.”

Admission to the game is free, but

" the schools will be hosting a 50-50 rafﬂe

with all proceeds going directly to sup-
port youth lacrosse in the area.

“It’s just a great thing to have for the
community,” McCabe said. “It’s a great
way to give back to the city of Lexing-
ton.”

And it’s a way of giving back that the
players enjoy.

“I interned this summer for a camp
in the area and I had an awesome time,”

said senior captain defender Tyler Smith.
“I was coaching kids from the Lexing-
ton and Roanoke area so I probably met
a lot of these kids. It’s deﬁnitely some-
thing that’s important for us.”

As far as a long-standing rivalry goes,
it may not be much of a contest. In the
23 years that the Classic has been held,
the Generals have lost only twice to the
Cadets. Last year, W&L took home the
Classic with a 14-8 victory.

“We always enjoy playing [VMI] a
lot,” Smith said. “It’s cool to be compet-
itive with a Division I team. But I think
fall practices have been going well and
we’re all pretty conﬁdent about it. I just
hope we play our best and then I think
we’ll win.”

But while the Cadets may not be the

a

Generals’ biggest foe of the year, the
game will be a strong preview of what
Generals’ fans can expect come. spring.
Smith, named to the All-ODAC Con-
ference team last year, will be back on
defense. Fellow captain senior attack
Will Keigler will be looking to continue
to build the scoring record that earned
him All-American Honorable Mention
last year and the proud title of sixth-

' leading scorer in the nation. Senior mid-

ﬁelder Kevin Feeney, who contributed
14 goals and two assists last year, will
also be returning for the Generals.

But the game is also an exhibition for
the new faces hoping to join the Gener-
als in the spring.

“We don’t use this game to decide
who’s on the team,” McCabe said. “But

Women’ssoccer falls to No:11 ranked foe

anyone who ’s on our roster for this game
has a really good chance.”

The game takes" place over VMI’s
homecoming weekend, but McCabe
said he hoped the W&L crowd would be
the one who screamed the loudest.

“VMI is bound to have a great crowd
so we need as many students and faculty
and staff as we can,” he said. “It would
be great to have a great W&L crowd
there to lead us to victory over VMI.”

The Lady Generals defeated Hollins University, but fell to Messiah College over the weekend to drop to 5-]

By Llzz Dye
smrr warren

The Washington and Lee women’s
soccer team lost its perfect record, go-
ing 1-1 for the week with a 6-0 victory
over Hollins University and a 5-0 loss
to No. 1 Messiah College. Ranked third
in the 2009 ODAC preseason poll, the
Generals are now 5-1 and 2-0 in ODAC
conference play.

In the Wednesday match-up against
Hollins, junior Laura Yungmeyer scored
the ﬁrst and only ﬁrst-half goal in the
34th minute off an assist from sopho-
more Allie Espina. The Generals picked
it up the second half and put ﬁve goals

in the net.

Senior midﬁelder Roz Klann scored
in the 52nd minute off an assist from
sophomore forward Kat Barnes. Barnes
contributed a goal of her own in the 56th
minute off an assist" from midﬁelder
Hannah Sackﬁeld. Senior midﬁelder
Maggie Sutherland scored the fourth
goal for the Generals in the 62nd minute
off another assist from Sackﬁeld. First-
year midﬁelder Ainsley Daigle contin-
ued her strong play for the Generals
and closed out the game with two more
goals. The ﬁrst came off a comer kick in

the 78th minute and the second was an
unassisted goal in the 88th minute.
Sophomore goalie Emily Leary
played all 90 minutes with two saves.
The Generals knew the Saturday
match-up against Messiah would be a
challenge. Unfortunately, the Generals
were unable to pull out a win. The 5-0
loss was a hard blow to the team, but
the players said it was deﬁnitely a good
experience to play against the 2008 Na-
tional Champions.
“We played well for the ﬁrst half,
but let off for 20 minutes in the second,

79

and that’s when they scored their goals,
said sophomore forward Anne Masich.

“We beat Hollins, but we have been
playing very inconsistently this week,”

added sophomore defender Corinne.

Smith. “We need to be strong all 90
minutes of the game in order to continue
to win. We’ve got to take a deep breath
and refocus to beat our tough opponents
coming up.” .

The Generals will need to put in some
extra work before they take on the tough
opponents coming up on their schedule.
The Generals face No. 1 ranked and

2007-2008 ODAC champions Lynch-
burg College on October 10.

' “We need to defend as a team and
capitalize on the opportunities that we
get when we play them because they are
a really good team,” Smith said.

The Generals will look to work
on building up their game in their
next match-up at Roanoke College on
Wednesday.

the tunnel when his new team, the Phil- .

adelphia Eagles, square off against the
Kansas City Chiefs, Plaxico Burress
will be sitting in a cell in the maximum
security prison of Rikers Island, outside
of New York City.

Admittedly, Burress made a mistake
by carrying a gun with him the night
he accidentally shot himself in the leg.
Burress was rushed to the hospital, and

made a full recovery from the injuries,
but turned himself in to authorities the
following week. A warrant was issued
for his arrest, not because the hospital
reported the shooting to the authorities,
but because the police department saw
the television coverage of the incident.
The mayor of New York City, Michael
Bloomberg, urged for Burress to be
prosecuted to the fullest extent of the
law and Burress quickly found himself
in a difﬁcult situation.

' Throughout his career, Burress has
never been exempt from criticism for his
off-ﬁeld actions. He has two restraining
orders issued against him for domestic
disturbances, both of which were even-

tually dropped. For most, Burress’s re-
cent actions were seen as a clear lapse
in judgment, but not necessarily a truly
criminal act. But today, Burress ﬁnds
himself in a cell next to some of the hard-
est criminals in New York City. Murder-
ers and drug dealers next to someone
who accidentally shot himself in the leg
doesn’t quite seem right. Burress wasn’t
a weapon-toting thug, but simply part of
a culture that sees many athletes carry
guns for “protection,” even if they rarely
think of using them.

Burress’s status as an NFL star clear-
ly worked against him in this case. The
New York City judicial,system made an
example of Burress by sentencing him

to two years in prison. Burress has made
the most of his difﬁcult situation, how-
ever. He hasn’t been making any excus-
es for his actions and has accepted his
punishment as best he can.

Michael Vick’s career has taken a
much better turn than Burress’s. Vick
will be on an NFL depth chart for the
ﬁrst time in two years this Sunday. Vick
had obvious issues before his prison
sentence. He was around the wrong type
of people, making the wrong type of de-
cisions at the height of his career. Vick
ﬁled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy while in
prison. He had irresponsibly squandered
the massive sums of the money he made
through his contracts and endorsements

and was left with virtually nothing. The
Eagles took a decided risk in signing
Vick, facing criticism from multiple ani-
mal rights organizations. But the Eagles
believe that Vick has turned a corner in
his life and greatly increased his level
of maturity.

While Vick may never be the star that
he was in Atlanta, his redemption proj-
ect can serve as motivation for Burress.
Maybe he, too, will make it through his
prison term and one day return to the
NFL.

Field hockey redeems slow start

Generals improve to 3-4 with wins over conference foes

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee ﬁeld hockey
team struggled to a 1-3 start, due in part to
some tough out-of-conference scheduling.
But “struggled” is not the way to describe
the Generals’ effort last week. W&L (3-
4, 2-1 ODAC) silenced a lot of doubters
with their performance against Lynchburg,
Randolph-Macon and Sweet Briar. The
Generals lost to Lynchburg, 3-2,'but rallied
to defeat both Randolph-Macon, 4-1, and
Sweet Briar, 5-2.

W&L played host_ to Lynchburg on
Wednesday and rose to the occasion, just
three days after a heartbreaking 3-2 over-
time loss to Catholic University. Lynchburg
arrived at the ﬁeld boasting a 5-2 record, a
four game winning streak versus W&L, a
No. 14 national ranking, and two attackers
(Jordan Warrington and Allie Weir) with
49 points scored between them.

The ladies in blue could have easily
packed their things and handed this game
to the Hornets. But the Generals went toe-
to-toe with their bitter rival.

Senior goalkeeper Caroline Habliston

V kept the game scoreless with some few

key saves. Finally, with less than two min-
utes left in the half, W&L caught a break.
Sophomore attacker Annie Stevenson
opened the scoring and shocked Lynchburg
with a goal from right in front of the cage.
First-year Chelsea Stevenson provided the
assist. The Stevenson connection gave the

Generals some momentum and much-
needed conﬁdence going into halftime
with a 1-0 lead.

But the Hornets came out buzzing to
start the second period and simply dom-
' inated play for the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes.
The Hornets tied the score quickly with
an unassisted goal by Kristina Morris.
W&L called a timeout shortly after, and
answered the call once again to take the
lead 2-1. Sophomore Lindsey Edmonds
netted the goal this time on a beautiful
hustle play and cross-field pass from
Stevenson. \

The ﬁrst-year dynamo energized
the team once again, and W&L tried to
hang on for the win. With four minutes
left in the game, however, Lynchburg
broke the hearts of the Generals. War-
rington and Weir each scored goals with
four minutes and two minutes left in the
game respectively. Their goals secured
a come-from-behind 3-2 victory for
Lynchburg.

In a game where so many things
went right for the Generals, they were
outplayed only two minutes late in the
game, and it cost them.

“It was simply mental errors, and men-
tal errors lead to physical errors,” said head
coach Wendy Orrison about the end of the
game.

The Generals took to the field again two
days later for another conference match-up
against Randolph-Macon.

Senior captain Sallie Armstrong
opened the scoring just 30 seconds into
the game and Alex Caritis added two
more goals to close out the half. Ran.-
dolph-Macon got onto the score sheet
with a penalty stroke in the second
half, but ﬁrst-year Ann Burton Gerhardt
dashed any comeback hopes with an un-
assisted goal. The goal put the Generals
ahead for a 4-1 victory.

‘‘I am very pleased,” Orrison said.
“They had every right to be tired and
they weren’t. We had great team speed”.

The team then traveled to Sweet Briar
on Saturday and came back home with
another big win under their belts with a
5-2 victory over Sweet Briar.

After a scoreless ﬁrst half, the Gen-
erals’ exploded with ﬁve goals scored
by senior Steph Mansey (2), sophomore
Christina Benedetti, junior Jennie Nor-
cini and ﬁrst-year Katharine Price.

“We are getting a signiﬁcant fresh-
man contribution,” Orrison said of the
ﬁrst-years’ impact. “They are giving us
some big minutes.” .

The Generals’ next game is a home
match-up against Limestone on Friday.
Come out and support the team, and per-
haps witness history as Armstrong looks to
pass the school record with one more goal.

VOLUME CXIII,

, Is America

‘Overtreated?’

Author Shannon Brownlee
demands less spending on

unnecessary healthcare

By Diandra Spicak
NEWS EDITOR

Forty-seven million people in the United States
lack healthcare insurance, and the number is growing.
One in six people under the age of 65 does not have
access to healthcare, and last year 20,000 Americans
died prematurely due to this absence of healthcare ,
according to Shannon Brownlee.

Former Senior Research Fellow and Bernard L.
Schwartz Fellow at the New America Foundation,
Brownlee spoke at Stackhouse Theater last Tuesday
as the ﬁrst speaker in the Johnson Lecture series. A
mix of humor, hard-hitting statistics and anecdotes,
Brownlee’s speech delineated the plight of many an
uninsured American in today’s society while pushing
the overall message of overtreatment in the healthcare
industry.

‘We fail to provide the needed
care, and provide healthcare that
they do not need instead... It 3 sort
of the Goldilocks principle. ”

SHANNON BROWNLEE, speaker

“This is the terrible paradox of our healthcare sys-
tem. We fail to provide the needed care: and provide
healthcare that they do not need instead,” she said.

‘ “It’s sort of the Goldilocks principle: we know that

too little care is bad for you, we know that too much
is bad for you. What you really want is just the right
amount.”

Brownlee proposed a few solutions to combat
what she refers to as “healthcare zombies,” or the
problems that face the healthcare industry and prevent
the industry from providing qualitative and quantita-
tive care to as many people as possible. She proposed
going after the regions in the country notorious for
spending the most but reaping the worst outcomes,
measuring the outcomes of the healthcare provided
by hospitals and more.

“We need to pay for care in a very different way,”
Brownlee said. “We’re getting what we pay for, but
we’re paying for them to do more, not to give better
care. I [also] think we need to have a very different way
patients decide whether they want elective procedures
and surgeries. We need a more democratized relation-
ship between physicians and patients.”

Brownlee also stressed the idea that good health
care comes from the bottom up, placing emphasis on
primary care instead of specialists.

“We need to beef up primary care and not succumb
to the call for more specialists,” she said. “Every de-
cent health care system in the world starts with robust
primary care, and every good health care system starts
with a good primary care ofﬁcial.” I

In the face of a country which seems reluctant to
pass health care reform, Brownlee still manages to
ﬁnd the bright side of things—even while spouting
against overtreatment. Her convictions rang true
throughout the speech as she ticked off the horrors of
overtreatment and undertreatrnent, but the author of
“Overtreated: Why Too Much Medicine is Making
Us Sicker and Poorer” (2007) still looks towards the
future of healthcare.

“I have a prediction. We’re going to pass some sort
of healthcare, and it’s going to help more people,” she
said. “If it doesn’t have some sort of public option, the
health insurance industry is going to get some kind of
huge boost. None of it is going to be easy. It’s not going
to be easy to transform a 2.4 trillion [dollar] industry.
It’s going to require changing patients’ minds. And
sometimes less really is more.”

Brownlee was only the ﬁrst of several public policy
experts to discuss issues pertaining to U.S. national
interests at W&L this year as part of the Johnson
Program’s “State of the Union” lecture series.

An accident this weekend injures a student and prompts community to remember safety

By Alllson Chopln
MANAGING EDITOR

An accident involving a Traveller
Express bus and a female student near
a party on Furrs Mill Road early Sat-
urday morning left the student injured
and hospitalized.

The university is awaiting the
report from the Virginia state police
before details can be conﬁrmed. Ac-
cording to Dawn Watkins, Dean of
Students, the community is currently
concerned with the student’s health
above all else.

As of Saturday afternoon, the stu-
dent was still hospitalized at Roanoke
Memorial Hospital and doing ﬁne,
Watkins said.

According to senior Brian Devine,
who witnessed the accident, 15 or
20 students were waiting outside of
County Seat, a house near the corner
of Furrs Mill and US-l l. A Traveller
bus turned on to Furrs Mill heading
toward the Pole Houses, where there
isia designated Traveller stop on the
Red Line.

There is not a stop at County Seat,
but the crowd of students “surged
forward” in an attempt to stop the bus
and a get a ride, Devine said.

“Since everyone was pushing,
trying to be at the front of the line, it
was perhaps inevitable that someone
would fall,” he said.

A female student fell underneath

the rear tires of the bus, according to '

Devine, and the crowd yelled at the
driver to back up and free her. Devine
and others ran to her side as they
waited for paramedics to arrive.

Watkins stressed that it is important
to give support to the student’s family,
and members of her ofﬁce have been
in close contact with the family.

The university has cooperated with
the police investigation and will con-

She said details from the police
report and the university’s investiga-
tion will guide any changes that may
be made to the Traveller program.

Some witnesses and others have
suggested that this incident cannot be
blamed on Traveller, but that the fault
lies with the irresponsible mentality of
crowds at student parties.

“The true fault is that 20 or so
W&L students were so selﬁshly eager

“We are not immune to tragedy... I hope that this

accident, though unfortunate, will act as a wake—up

call for our student body. ”

KATIE BOILES, Traveller chair

duct its own internal review, according
to the university’s press release.

Some have expressed concern
about the future of Traveller, but
Watkins said that the safe ride program
will not be stopping service.

“Traveller is there for a very impor-
tant reason,” she said. It exists for the
safety of students and is “continually
under review.”

Q

to get on Traveller that they effectively
pushed one of their own underneath a
bus,” said Devine.

“If people living in the country
keep ignoring the basic safety of their
guests, this incident will not be the
last,” he said.

Senior Katie Boiles, chair of Trav-
eller, said students should assume per-
sonal responsibility in being conscious

of safety at parties.

They should be aware that the
buses will only stop at designated
stops, for example, and they should
pay attention to the Traveller moni-
tors who can help direct crowds and
answer questions, she said.

“We are not immune to tragedy,”
said Boiles. “I hope that this accident,
though unfortunate, will act as a wake-
up call for our student body.”

She added that students should
remember that Traveller is a privilege,
and this privilege requires respect for
Traveller drivers.

“We pride ourselves on honor and
integrity, but how honorable is it to
bang on the windows and door of a
bus while screaming at a driver to let
you on?” she asked.

This is the ﬁrst accident result-
ing in an injury since the inception
of the Traveller program about ﬁve
years ago.

Hearing board havoc

Committee charged with reviewing SFHB, student leaders question process

By Alllson Chopln
MANAGING EDITOR

Washington and Lee is looking at
the way it currently handles cases of
assault, discrimination and harass-
ment.

This term President Ken Ruscio
appointed a committee to study
the Student-Faculty Hearing Board
(SFHB) and suggest revisions to the
board’s judicial process.

While many students are glad to
see the SFHB come under review,
some—even members of the Execu-
tive Committee—are questioning the
efﬁcacy of the committee.

The SFHB is responsible for hear-
ing cases regarding discrimination,
hazing and sexual misconduct or
harassment. There are typically eight
students and eight faculty members
on the board, in addition to a faculty

I chair and a student vice-chair.

The faculty chair is selected by
the university provost, while the vice-
chair is appointed by the EC.

According to a news release from
the review committee, members of
the W&L community have recently
“expressed concern regarding the
general structure of” the SFHB.

At a student body meeting called
this past spring, several students
claimed that they did not know what
the SFHB was, how cases were
handled or how to go about reporting a

case. Some expressed concerns about
conﬁdentiality of the accuser and ac-
cused in cases of sexual assault, while
others suggested that more transpar-
ency is necessary to maintain W&L’s
tradition of student self-govemance.

The review committee, appointed ,,

by Ruscio, is made up of Dean Rod
Smolla, senior Alex Eichenbaum;
third-year law student Patrick Rowe,
Trustee Jessine Monaghan, Trustee
Robert Grey, Provost June Aprille,
Dean Dawn Watkins, Professor Mi-
chael Anderson and Professor Robin
Wilson.

The committee is seeking input
from the community as it completes
its study. It has already held one open
forum, and the members also plan to
meet with interested groups or indi-
viduals who would like to contribute
their views.

Interested community members
may also submit suggestions online.

The committee’s initial focus
includes examining the SFHB’s
structure, standards and deﬁnitions
of prohibited conduct, jurisdiction in
relationship to other judicial bodies
on campus, procedures and sanctions,
public image and its guiding values.

At the open forum held in Northen
Auditorium on Wednesday, students
and community members had the
chance to share their views in front
of the members of the review com-
mittee.

A few of the students present
shared their concern that a majority of
W&L students do not know how the
SF HB works, and some probably have
not even heard of the board.

Some pointed out that W&L stu-
dents are repeatedly told about the
university’s high sexual assault rate,
yet the SFHB deals with only a few
cases. They wonder why cases are not
reported more often. Moreover, as one
student pointed out, since the board is
infrequently used, it is hard to judge
the SFHB’s record of success.

Another concern was uncertainty
over the SF HB ’s relation to the EC, as
well as the Student Judicial Council,
which handles student misconduct.

The committee will consider these
suggestions, write a report and hold
another open forum on Oct. 19.

Eichenbaum, the only undergradu-
ate representative on the commit-
tee, said she was pleased with the
discussion at Wednesday’s forum,
even though the turnout from the
community was less than she had
anticipated.

“Those students who attended the
open forum were vocal with their
opinions and had some good sugges-
tions,” she said.

Scott Centorino, Vice President of
the EC, questions whether the review
committee will be able to properly
uphold W&L’s cherished idea of stu-
dent self-govemance when only one

undergraduate is on the committee.

“That seems absolutely befud-
dling,” he said. “It seems to be the
administration saying [it is] going to
ﬁx the SFHB.” '

While Centorino respects the com-
mittee for holding an open forum and
allowing the community to contribute,
he would still like to see more students
on the committee. ‘‘I think students
should have a more direct voice,”
he said.

He also pointed out some potential
conﬂicts of interest. Some members
on the review committee have been
members of the SFHB itself, and
while Centorino said he understands
that their insightis valuable, he does
not believe that they should be active
members of the committee.

For example, Rowe has been on
the SF HB, and Aprille, as provost, has
the responsibility of appointing the
faculty chair of the board. Centorino
questions whether these individuals
can fairly review a judicial body that
has been under their own authority.

Centorino and other EC members
suggested that the EC is not united
on what action should be taken in
response to the review committee’s
process. Eric Hoffman, EC president,
could not be reached for comment
before press time.

Hillel House makes headway

New building will feature environmentally friendly design and new opportunities for Jewish activities on campus

By Chelsea Stevenson
5 TA r r w a IT E R

At the end of this month a
7,000 square foot construction
project promoting economic and
community growth, will be well
underway here on campus. The
comer of Washington and Jef-
ferson Streets will soon become
the home of W&L’s first Hillel
house, which will be up and ready
for community use by September
2010.

Plans and designs for the
house began about two years ago,
after sufﬁcient ﬁmdraising. Proj-
ect Manager Carole Bailey and
Hillel Director Joan Robins have
been working extensively with
architects Glave and Holmes As-
sociates Architecture and Design,
as well as construction managers
Kjellstrom and Lee.

Glave and Holmes, who are

also responsible for the Colon-
nade restoration project, have
made the design and construction
of the Hillel house unique.

The house was designed to
achieve Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED)
Certiﬁcation.

Created by and in association
with the U.S Green Building
Council, LEED is an interna-
tional environmentally concerned
certiﬁcation system. In order to
obtain LEED Certification, a
building must be designed and
constructed with the goal of
improving performance in the
community. This must be ac-
complished by promoting water
efficiency, indoor environmental
quality increases, and carbon
monoxide reduction. The Hillel
house deﬁnitely is in competition
with the renovations of Newcomb

hall to be the ﬁrst W&L building
to achieve LEED.

The exterior design of the
Hillel house will feature a gar-
den with 21 trees and a variety
of vegetation. The plants were
chosen for their ability to to
utilize storm water and remain
alive through dry spells. These
native plants include Rudbeckia
mix, Loose Strife, Little Leaf
Boxwoods, Northern Seaoat, and
Iris. The LEED certiﬁcation pro-
cess continues on the interior with
water—efficient ﬁxtures, which
will treat and conserve storm wa-
ter to help improve Lexington’s
water system.

Aside from the environmental ‘

beneﬁts, the outer appearance of
the house will also change from

- the former Howard House, which

was home to Human Resources
and the Office of Special Pro-

grams, both of which have been
relocated.

Bailey described the side of
the house adjacent to the R. E.
Lee Episcopal Church as looking
“buffer.” The narrow church alley
that once existed will be turned
into a sidewalk, to beneﬁt the
church traffic as well. Internally,
the house will also contain many
non-environmental assets.

The interior of the house will
include a lounge and a cafe. The
cafe, which will be open for
breakfast and dinner on the meal
plan, will feature multiple kosher
options, including a large bagel
component. Alex Dasilva, the
director of campus dining at W&L
has been playing a large role in
this process. ’

A large multipurpose room for
Hillel ceremonies and services
will also be on the ﬁrst ﬂoor. This

multipurpose room will feature a
Torah that was rescued from the
Holocaust, which will be widely
appreciated during W&L’s annual
Holocaust Remembrance Week.
The upstairs of the house will
be home to ofﬁces, conference
rooms, restrooms and a study
area.

Joan Robins, the director of
W&L Hillel, has predicted many
signiﬁcant beneﬁts that the design
and presence of the house will
bring to the W&L community.
Founded in‘ the l960’s and re-
vived in 1989, Hillel is entirely
student-run and brings many
activities to campus, which ap-
peal to a broad range of Jewish
students.

These activities include sig-
niﬁcant programs and trips. For
example, Hillel will sponsor the
ten-day Birthright Israel trip in

December and June, and a trip to
Uruguay in February.

Over 165 different people
donated a combined 4 ‘million
dollars to the project. A quarter
of this ﬁmdraising was donated
by eight Zeta Beta Tau brothers
of the class of 1959, in honor of
their 50”‘ reunion here at W&L.
Zeta Beta Tau, which no longer
has a chapter here, is the ﬁrst na-
tional Jewish fraternity. The W&L
Board of Trustees and numerous
local community members made
signiﬁcant contributions to the
fundraising as well, especially
Rector Don Childress ’70 and
Mark Eaker ’69. According to
Robins, this illustrates a large
community-based inclusiveness
that she hopes will be incorpo-
rated into the end product, the
completion of the house.

CKP collaborates with Walmart

Walmart donates unneeded food and supplies to W&L is Campus Kitchen as part of new partnership

By Valaree Tang
STAFF WRITER

The Campus Kitchen Project
at Washington and Lee (CKP)
has been receiving food donations
from the local Walmart since the
beginning of September.

The W&L kitchen began
working with Walmart through
its partnership with Feeding
America, the nation’s largest
hunger-relief organization, and
the Blue Ridge Area Food Bank.
It is the ﬁrst kitchen to partner
with Walmart.

CKP is currently receiving 700
to 1,500 pounds of food a week,
nearly six times what it received
last year.

“CKP was bursting at the
seams with its visionary outreach,
and this partnership allows us to
serve more people more food,”

said Caitlin Edgar, who is a
member of the CKP leadership
team.

Most of the food that is
received from Walmart is dairy,
baked goods and dry grocery
products. Most of the food that
is received is gently damaged
foods ,including dented cans and
cartons of eggs in which one egg
may be cracked.

“Walmart has high standards
on what can be sold, so there is
an abundance of perfectly good
food that they cannot sell because
of damaged packaging. The
number of eggs that they were
throwing out was unbelievable,”
said volunteer Austin Branstetter,
who participated in the first
Walmart food pick-up. “From
now on, CKP will supply more
than enough food to ﬁll the fridges

and many hungry mouths.”

CKP received mainly already-
cooked food from some fraternity
houses, W&L Dining Services
and local businesses. The CKP
has added two more cooking
positions due to the amount of
raw food that it receives from
Walmart. Three more pick-up
positions have also been added to
transport the food from Walmart
to CKP three times a week.

The extra food donated by
Walmart has allowed CKP to feed
more people more often. “lt’s
given the leadership team and the
interns a new level of energy and
excitement. Now we can ﬁnally
move forward with the plans
we had in the past,” said CKP
coordinator Jenny Sproul.

One of the plans include
creating new programs with

-new agencies. CKP is currently

working on outreach with the
Glasgow community using a
backpack program. Students who
qualify for one to two free meals
per day at school will be eligible
for a backpack ﬁlled with basic
pantry items to take home for the
weekend. “This will ensure that
the children have enough food
to eat over the weekend,” said
Edgar.

About sixty volunteers donate
their time to CKP per week,
according the Sproul, and nearly

While you’re out... be smarter about Traveller

In light of the recent Traveller accident, Cody Beauchamp wonders how to make sober rides safer

By Cody Beauchamp
COLUMNIST

So, can we talk about the fact
that a Washington and Lee stu-
dent got run over by a bus this
weekend?

In the interest of full disclo-
sure, I should note that I was not
actually at the scene of the acci-
dent Friday night. What follows
is what I was told by at least a
dozen different people who were
at the scene. The various stories
each conﬁrm the following basic
facts, so I assume what follows is
fairly accurate.

It was a typical big party night
at the Poles. A Traveller bus was
nearing the County Seat stop
when it was swarmed by dozens
of drunk students all wanting to

board. As the bus tried to halt-

ingly make its way through the
crowd, a student near the front of
the crowd was pushed forward
and crushed under the bus.

This student, whose identity I
won’t be revealing out of respect
for their privacy, had to be taken
the hospital by ambulance, and
I’ve since heard rumors that his
or her injuries consist of every-
thing from a simple broken leg
right up to shattered legs, hips
and vertebrae.

Besides wishing the student
the quickest and best recovery

possible, I want to address two
other points. The ﬁrst is that
something like this was bound to
happen eventually. The second is
that we all have a responsibility
to ensure that something like this
never happens again.

On the ﬁrst point, I would ask
anyone who has ever been to a
country party to think about the
experience. Speciﬁcally, think
about the role that Traveller plays
at these country parties.

Looking back over all these
party nights, I remember scores
of times this exact same thing al-
most happened.

One friend described it to
me as something out of zombie
movie; the crowd all wants to
go somewhere to the next party,
the Quad, somewhere, and when
they see a Traveller bus coming
their way, they lose all their com-
mon sense and swarm the bus.

Future Phi Beta Kappas will
lose their damn minds and stand
in the middle of the road, all be-
cause they’re determined to get
on Traveller, trafﬁc laws of the
Commonwealth be damned.

Which brings me to my sec-
ond point: at the risk of sounding
patronizing, this is a problem.
Um. . .duh. '

W&L is full of very smart
people. The fundamental prob-
lem is not that we’re stupid
enough to think we should ac-
tually swarm a moving tvvo-ton
bus. The fundamental problem
is that when we need Traveller,
we’re hammered.

I’m not going to say the so-
lution is that we should all drink

care of beforehand.

My ﬁrst year at W&L, I was
asked to do a number of articles
for the Phi on how overcrowd-
ing on the Traveller system was
causing trouble. Apparently, that
problem has neither gone away
nor been ﬁxed in the intervening
years.

We need more Traveller buses

By God, we ’re drunk, we ’re in the

country and we will get to where we

want to go!

less, or that we should all behave
ourselves when Traveller rolls
up. I’m not na'1've enough to think
that either thing will happen, re-
gardless of how many tibias are
shattered or how many preachy,
“Remember the Honor System!”
editorials are published. By God,
we’re drunk, we’re in the coun-
try, and we will get to where we
want to go!

Instead, I propose that the
solution lies before the parties
— these are logistical concerns
that can be anticipated and taken

Law and undergrad divide

Law student laments the disappointing status

By Jordan Rothman
co LU M NIST

I have always wanted to at-
tend Washington and Lee. Ever
since I applied to colleges as a
senior in high school, I knew that
W&L was the right place for me.
The small community, the sense
of history, and many other attri-
butes all increased my desire to
attend the institution.

I ended up not applying to
W&L for my undergraduate
studies, because my parents
strongly urged me to attend

enough to complete a Master’s
degree during my senior year of
college. This ﬂuidity extended
from the academic arena to so-
cial and extra-curricular life on
campus.

Grad students were invited to
every campus event, competed
on athletic and academic teams,
went to parties with undergrads
and otherwise participated in the
varying parts of the Brandeis ex-
perience.

that law students and undergrads
are just different. Somehow gra-
dating from college makes one a
totally different person, incapa-
ble of fully breaking the divide.
I, for one, do not believe that
there is much appreciable dif-
ference between law students
and undergrads, certainly noth-
ing that would merit a perpetu-
ation of the divide. For instance,
I may have a B.A. and an M.A.
But I am still only 22 years old,

We are all one community here at W&L, and I think that we all

should do more toward bridging the law school/undergrad divide.

Brandeis. Nevertheless, I knew
that if I worked hard enough,
got the right grades, and studied
diligently for the LSAT, perhaps
someday I could enroll at W&L
Law.

Once admitted this May, I
hoped that I could perhaps ex-
perience some of what it might
have been like to be an undergrad
here. Though of course tethered
to my legal studies, I hoped to
gain the full W&L experience

It seems, however, that there
is a law school-undergrad divide
here at our university. Not only
are these communities separated
by a road and a separate campus,
but they also seem divided by so
much more than geographic bar-
riers.

To a large extent, this division
makes sense, as law students and
undergrads take classes in sepa-
rate buildings, have divergent
goals and are disconnected for
a number of other reasons. Yet,
we are all one community here
at W&L, and I think that we all
should do more toward bridging
the law school-undergrad divide.

I had sort of a unique expe-
rience as an undergrad. The line
between undergraduate and grad-
uate studies at Brandeis is very
thin, and I was even fortunate

cha rity’.’ nained? I

I remember having grad stu-
dents in my classes, as my RAs
and as members of a number of
clubs and activities. All told, I
expected to have similar expe-
riences here, but this belief was
somewhat mistaken.

Law students are not mem-
bers of many undergrad clubs,
and I even had to jump through
hoops to write for this paper.
Furthermore, many undergrad
events are not directly advertised
to law students, and I must typi-
cally get event information see-
ond-hand.

Also, there are not many
ways to socialize with members
of the undergraduate commu-
nity, and though I live in Woods
Creek with undergrads, I hardly
ever meet them. I assure you, I
don’t desire to meet undergrads
in order to put the moves on
them or for any other reasons of
that nature. I just want to interact
with the people with whom I will
be sharing this campus for the
next three years.

All told, though we have one
executive committee and are
such a small university, the law
school-undergrad divide per-
sists.

Many people might fortify
this divide because they believe

and fail to see how being four
months out of undergrad should
merit me hearing some sort of
special status.

All told, undergrads are really
nice to me (and presumably to
other law students as well), and I
am not saying that I am receiving
a cold shoulder from the under-
graduate community for being a
law student.

What I am trying to say, is that
people should try harder to inte-
grate the two communities. Law
students like to party as much as
you do, and we deﬁnitely like
any event that has free food.

In addition, because our uni-
versity is so small and there
isn’t much else going on in Lex-
ington, we might as well get to
know each other. ,

I know there have been sto-
ries of how law students have
only attempted to breach the di-
vide to hit on the undergrads. I
also know that some may think
that we had our time as under-
grads, and should stick to the law
school community.

Nevertheless, I hope that
people proactively take steps to
bring our university together and
bridge the law school-undergrad
divide.

   
      
 
  
 

and better deﬁned stops. People
should have a lamppost, or a
“Form a Line Here” sign, or a
tumstile, or something that pre-
vents them from thinking that the
best way to land a seat is to gate-
crash a moving van.

For that matter, we should
have people at these stops who
are both capable of working
crowd control and willing to do
it. Perhaps the gentlemen throw-
ing these parties would be will-
ing to volunteer a few people to
keep this kind of problem from

happening in the future?

Before I go on, I Want to make
it clear I’m not faulting any fra-
ternity for what happened to the
injured student.

I know that Sigma Chi had
hired drivers for the party they
threw that caused the country
crowds. When I went out to pick
up stranded friends after the ac-

cident, I even saw a lot of Sig-
ma Chi upperclassmen helping
ﬁnd rides for the people who
had been stranded at the Pole
Houses. I commend them for
that; they did not at all seem
negligent to me.

Nonetheless, this incident
has made it perfectly clear that
what we’re already doing is

not enough. So, as painful and as
much of a hassle as it is, maybe
we need to do more.

Maybe we should start build-
ing crowd control barriers so that
drunk girls in stilettos can’t get
within falling range of a moving
bus (anyone else see a problem
with this?).

Maybe we should start expect-
ing the IFC to require its member
organizations to do more to sup-
port Traveller than what it cur-
rently does (which, as far as I can
tell, is basically the equivalent of

a thumbs-up).

Maybe we should start asking
party hosts to provide people to
work Traveller crowd control.
After all, these parties are rec-
ognized as important enough to
have a mass transit system run
directly to them. Maybe requir-
ing that a few sober brothers
work Traveller is actually a fair
price for having what is basically
school sponsorship of private
parties.

Again, I don’t want to give
the impression that I’m out to
condemn any organization or
even our cultural bacchanalia.

It’s just that, quite obviously,
we need to do something to keep
this kind of thing from happening
again. I’m told that if the injured
student had been a few inches
farther under the bus, his or her
spine would have been shattered.
I’m told that if he or she had
fallen head-ﬁrst instead of feet-
ﬁrst, he or she would have been
killed.

W&L hasn’t had a student
killed because of drunk driving
in a‘ very long time. It will be a
sad, sad irony if one dies because
our safe-ride systems continue to
be so overwhelmed. _

Catharine MacKinnon and the future of gender

Aleisha Butler analzyes gender as a stereotype based on social constructs rather than biology

By Alelsha Butler
c 0 L u M N IS T

Catharine MacKinnon, a re-
nowned feminist legal scholar
and law professor, spoke on is-
sues surrounding sexual abuse,
pornography and gender in Lee
Chapel on Thursday. She ﬁrst
addressed the fact that gender as
we understand it is in fact social-
ly constructed, not biological.

Many people use the terms
“sex” and “gender” interchange-
ably, when in reality they are two
different categories.

Sex is biologically deter-
mined: you are born with either
a penis or a vagina, and even that
boundary is sometimes blurred.

Gender, however, is a much
more complicated affair. Across
time and space, the deﬁnitions
of masculinity and femininity
have fluctuated wildly, but what
MacKinnon pointed out was
that, regardless of time or place

or sexual standards, a socially-_

constructed, gendered inequality
has always existed.

In some cultures, there are
more than two genders. This is
hard for us in the Judeo-Chris-
tian, Western world to under-
stand, but here’s an example:
men and women who enjoy and
prefer same-sex (not same-gen-
der) relations are ostracized be-
cause they are not acting as men
and women “should.”

Likewise, in some cultures,
there are men who dress as
women and are considered wom”—
an-like, and in others there are
women who dress as men and
are considered man-like, but they
have full rights and are accepted
for the gender they choose.

We insist on combining biol-
ogy with gender, and still try to
squeeze people into one of the
only two available categories
that our culture provides us with
— “male” and “female. “

MacKinnon discussed how,
in our society, the female half

of the population is subordinate
to the male. That subordination
is maintained through a culture-
wide set of institutions that serve
to socialize males and females
into accepting, and enjoying,
their respective dominant and
subordinate positions.

Her personal theory is that
pornography is responsible for
this structure by promoting and
reinforcing a gendered sexuality
in which the woman is the pas-
sive, submissive receiver. This
is easily transferred into real-life
violence and rape.

Pornography is problematic,
she says, because it teaches our
society that women tolerate rape.
What consumers of porn do not
see is that many of the women in
the industry have been badgered,

overall numbers of rape vic-
tims, they’re currently about 90
percent women and 10 percent
men.

She acknowledged that this
drastic difference may be due
in part to underreported rape of
males, but that underreporting,
she pointed out, is due to the fact
that rape is a humiliating act.

In our society, to be feminine
is to be weak and dependant; the
power of rape is that it feminizes
the person on the receiving end.

Rape demonstrates that the
inequality in our society is not
biological, but gendered. In our
gender dichotomy, where men
are expected to be strong, domi-
nant and aggressive, rape is the
ultimate humiliation. Men are
therefore socialized into liking

paign of crimes against women
has never been seen as the delib-
erate, genocidal efforts to control
and contain that they are.

After this summer’s attack on
an exercise class full of women
in Bridgeville, Pennsylvania,
columnist Bob Herbert wrote in
The New York Times, “We have
become so accustomed to living
in a society saturated with misog-

yny that the barbaric treatment '

of women and girls has come to
be more or less expected... We
would become much saner, much
healthier, as a society if we could
bring ourselves to acknowledge
that misogyny is a serious and
pervasive problem.”

Rape and sexual assault are
hate crimes, and need to be treat-
ed as so.

Professor MacKinnon is talk was incredibly thought—provoking

and unashamedly blunt, characteristics that I think we need to see

l’I’l0I"€ around our campus.

coerced and abused into partici-
pating in these forms of media.

We see a woman “consent-
ing” to a ﬁlm of her being raped,
and therefore think she consent-
ed to it. However, if you look up
“consent” in the dictionary, you
will ﬁnd that it means the same
thing as “yield,” “comply” and
“submit.” Compliance doesn’t
seem like a sexy term, but in
porn it seems to be.

At the end of MacKinnon’s
talk, a VMI cadet in the audience
asked her how she could say that
there was inequality when men
get raped by women, too.

Her response "was incredibly
enlightening. She agreed that
yes, men are raped by women,
but that when you look at the

the dominant position they are
told to be in, while women, who
can be physically controlled by
the men in their lives, learn to
expect, appreciate and work with
. their dependency.

Catharine MacKinnon’s work
has largely centered on represent-
ing abused women in the sex-
for-sale industry. She has writ-
ten legislation demanding that
sexual assault, rape and abuse of
women in pornography be con-
sidered civil rights crimes.

Any other crimes targeted
against speciﬁc groups of peo-
ple, be they African-American,
Hispanic, Jewish, etc., are con-
sidered hate crimes.

MacKinnon points out that the
world-wide, centuries-long cam-

The issue of pornography is
where my opinion differs slight-
ly from MacKinnon’s. A W&L
student asked Professor MacK-
innon if she thought that any-
thing should be done about the
messages being sent in today’s
popular music. While she agreed
the misogyny in popular music
is a problem,.she believes that
pornography is the larger issue.
However, I see it the other way
around.

Young teenagers, fourteen and
ﬁfteen-year-olds, are not likely
to be exposed to porn; they are
likely to turn on the radio and hit
up the Top Ten list on iTunes.

In the formative stages of
their development, just begin-
ning to sort out what it means

to be a man or a woman, adoles-
cents are under a constant bar-
rage from the music, movie and
fashion industries.

MacKinnon believes that
pornography leads to a de-
tached, numbed sexuality. While
I believe porn exacerbates those
problems, I think they form long
before young people come in
contact with pornography. ‘

Instant messenger, texting,
and sites like MySpace and
Facebook enable people to have
entire conversations with one an-
other without ever having to see
someone’s face or hear his or her
voice. It has become easier to see
people, especially anonymous
sex actors on a screen, as objects
for your enjoyment.

The problem is that that oh-
jectiﬁcation just transfers over
into real life. In a place like col-
lege, where alcohol obliterates
self-control and inhibitions, the
two make for scary male-fernale
interactions.

Professor MacKinnon thinks
that pornography is inherently
detrimental for women, and that
to eliminate gender hierarchy we
need to eliminate porn. Howev-
er, barring a global nuclear holo-
caust, the media is probably here
to stay and we should utilize it to
make changes.

Rather than try to eliminate
such a huge industry, why not
utilize it for good? Why not make
porn about people who love each
other and use their sexuality to
connect and build trust?

I recently read an article in
which the author called out rap-
per Jay-Z for not working to
change the gender relationships
within his own community. A
proliﬁc musician and inﬂuential
cultural icon, someone like Jay-
Z, who seems to be very hap-
pily married, could do a lot for
his community and the culture

at large by making ideas like
commitment and mutual respect
“cool.”

Finally, if W&L is so truly
committed to changing our
sexual assault climate, why was
Professor MacKinnon’s talk not
mandatory? ‘

The university cannot keep
tabs on all students, but they
could at least have required that
the ﬁrst-years, who are just be-
ginning to sort out the positives
and negatives of college, be in
attendance.

Professor MacKinnon’s talk
was incredibly thought-provok-
ing and unashamedly blunt, char-
acteristics that I think we need to
see more around our campus.

She did not try to soften the
impact of her words. She did not
mind that some people would
be defensive or offended after
her talk; the truth usually causes
such reactions.

I did not blindly agree with
every word that came out of her
mouth, but so much of what she
said would have been so beneﬁ-
cial for our campus to hear.

In attendance last night there
was a scattering of professors,
some upper‘-class W&L students,
and some VMI cadets. The peo-
ple who were in attendance were
not the people who really needed
to hear what she had to say.

In this pivotal, turbulent
moment in history, MacKinnon
urges us to choose the future
we want for ourselves and our
children. I think that if the W&L
administration want to have any
kind of inﬂuence on how their
students treat each other, they
need to bring more people like
MacKinnon to campus, and they
need to ensure that words like
hers are heard.

Pornography is not so evil

In response to Aleisha Butler, Stockton Bullitt examines pornography

By Stockton Bullltt
OPINIONS EDITOR

Being a college newspaper
editor has its perks. Besides the
fame, money and women, it al-
lows me to rant and rave about
every little detail with which I
disagree. Basically, I can do what
an English teacher does to your
essays, except that you might ac-
tually read what I’m scribbling
down next to your “A-.”

Since I was in charge of edit-
ing the piece, I had the opportuni-
ty to read Aleisha Butler’s article
on gender before you did.

I would give you a quick re-
cap of what she said, but the ar-
ticle is literally right above mine,
so all you really need to do is
look a little farther up on the page
to see what I’m talking about.

Although Ms. Butler wrote a
wonderful article and had clear-
ly formed and well thought-out
opinions on the subject of gender,
she has one little problem when
it comes to her discussion of the
role of pornography in gender
bias: she’s wrong.

The good news is that I can’t
really blame Ms. Butler for being
wrong.

She has two major factors
stacking up against her with re-
spect to her outlook on pomeg-
raphy. First of all, she is grossly
misinformed, mostly by Catha-
rine MacKinnon. Second, she has
not had nearly enough ﬁrsthand
experience with pornography to
accurately judge its effect.

V Now, I think it is quite obvious
that Ms. Butler cannot be blamed
for either of these problems; nev-
ertheless, she is still quite wrong.

Ms. Butler’s initial problem
is much more Ms. MacKinnon’s
problem than Ms. Butler’s. Ms.
MacKinnon says that pornogra-
phy is bad because “because it

teaches our society that women
tolerate rape.” Women do not
ever “tolerate” rape.

I have yet to hear of one wom-
an who has been ﬁne with being
raped. Furthermore, no woman
ever consents to being raped.
Why? Because if she consented,
it wouldn’t be rape.

Pornography cannot be con-
sidered an inherently misogy-
nistic entity, much less an inher-
ently evil entity. Men do not view
women differently because of
what they see in porn, especially
when it comes to rape. I do not
have evidence of an educational
scholar saying this, mostly be-
cause I am way too lazy to look
anything up, but, trust me, it
doesn’t. I have never met any guy
whose‘ view of women has been
altered thanks to what he has seen
late at night online.

Saying that watching porn
leads to rape, as Ms. MacKinnon
did, is simply ludicrous. For the
most part, pornography features
only consensual sex between
partners. And while there are ap-
parently pornographic videos that
feature heinous things like rape
and child abuse, that in no way
correlates to the entire industry.
Not only are those videos illegal,
but they also have nothing to do
with the industry itself.

Blaming the porn industry for
these videos is like blaming Uni-
versal and Empire Records for a
song that someone independently
recorded and posted on his own
MySpace page. ‘

Ms. Butler alludes to some of
the pitfalls of Ms. MacKennon’s
arguments in her article, but she
could still go further with her dis-
agreement with Ms. MacKinnon.

There are much bigger issues

that contribute to problem of mi-
sogyny than pornography. The
real problem with sexism lies not
in the major forever ﬁnite indus-
tries of today, like pornography,
music and the Internet, but rather
in the minute, easily ﬁxable de-
tails that we encounter on a daily
basis.

These small details are even
evident here on campus, yet they
always seem to go completely
unnoticed.

For example, in the ﬁrst-year
dorms, the boys get the ﬁrst two
ﬂoors, while the girls get the top
ﬂoors. There are reasons for this,
even though the reasons remain
somewhat sketchy. Still, right
on move-in day, the girls are still
subtly forced to carry their lug-
gage those extra few ﬂights of
stairs.

If there is an assumption that
watching a ﬁve-minute video fea-
turing consensual intercourse is
going to make a guy misogynis-
tic, then having all the guys live
on the bottom two ﬂoors in the
ﬁrst-year dorms, when they are
apparently most impressionable,
has to have at least some effect.

An unrelated critique of Ms.
Butler’s assertions is her exami-
nation of the word “consent.” She
says, “Compliance docsn’t seem
like a sexy term, but in porn it
seems to be.”

Now, I have seen a fair share
of pornographic videos in my
life (only for academic purposes
of course), and I have yet to see
“comply” or “consent” used by
the pizza boy or the nurse to try
and seduce his or her partner.

Also, I guess if the word is
used in porn, it probably is not
used in a sexy way, and most of
the time, the uses of the words

“comply” and “consent” is ex-
tremely important.

Those words are used to make
sure that the women appearing in
these videos are treated with as
much respect as possible. How
can‘ they be bad things?

I also took up Ms. Butler’s
advice and looked up the word
“consent” in a dictionary, the
Oxford English Dictionary. She
wrote that after looking up con-
sent, I would ﬁnd a deﬁnition
strikingly similar toithe words
yield, comply and submit.

Unfortunately, only one of
those three words played an inte-
gral role in the deﬁnition of con-
sent in the Oxford English Dic-
tionary. I have used comply and
consent as synonyms in this arti-
cle, so I was not surprised when it
showed up in consent’s deﬁnition,
but the other two words and their
connotations were stunningly
absent from Oxford’s deﬁnition
of the word. I guess we can just
blame that one on the British.

Because of pornography’s
reputation as a sleazy and dirty
trade, it is easy to assume that it is
inherently evil and leads innocent
boys into doing terrible things.

In fact, blaming bad actions
on abstract inﬂuences is always
easy to do. Why blame a murder
on someon’s parents when you
can blame Metallica, Eminem,
and Grand Theft Auto?

And for that matter, why
blame the rapist, when you can
always blame Jenna Jameson,
Ron Jeremy and all of their mali-
cious minions?

I want to break out into spon-
taneous song and dance across the

4 Colonnade.

‘ Not only that, but I want it to
be a campus-wide affair, complete
with jazz hands, shimmies and at-
titude.

That’s the feeling you walk
away with after watching “Fame.”

The remake of the 1980 ﬁlm
follows students at the New York
City High School for the Perform-
ing Arts.

Each student excels in music,
acting or dance, and they’re all
uniﬁed in their pursuit for fame and

. recognition.

The plot focuses on six students

~ as they navigate their individual
paths to professional careers.

There are standard themes such
as love, heartbreak, and external
pressure, but “Fame” also explores
the anxiety associated with compe-
tition and growing up.

The ﬁlm’s strength lies simply
in its entertainment value: dance
sequences, singing and catchy

. soundtrack. .

One moment the students are
engulﬁng their lunches, and sud-
denly, WHAM, they’re pirouetting
and leaping across cafeteria tables.

It’s all about high energy.

The camera angles do a good
job of capturing all of this. ‘

In scenes where a central char-
acter is onstage, the point of view
and surveying pan shots help create
the sense of performance adrena-

. line.

‘Fame’ film provides
light-hearted fun

Movie is strong in energetic dance and
song, but gives no deep message

But the ﬁlm fails to deliver any-
thing beyond glittering musical
numbers.

The characters are not sufﬁ-
ciently developed to stand on their
own, and their story lines are weak
because of the focus on six story-
lines with separate problems.

Less is more, and there’s sim-
ply too much going on in too little
time.

At times, the ﬁlm lost its au-
thenticity. It tried to capture the
gritty parts of the audition pro-
cess, but I can safely say, coming
from a similar performing arts high
school, that half of those students

-would be turned away at the door

for wearing street clothes.
Despite the blunders, “Fame”

is not without impressive perfor-'

mances.
Former “Will and Grace” star
Megan Mullally plays an acting
instructor in the ﬁlm and brings a
sense of realism and compassion to
the role.

ing out most of the songs on the

So the real question is, should
you spend $8 on a movie ticket?

then yes. Looking for something
deeper? I hear “Public Enemies” is

Field hockey defeats Limestone 4-1 and senior captain Sallie Armstrong earns her place in W&L sports history

By Stephen Peck
STAFF w R ITER

Senior captain forward Sallie Arrn-
strong stepped up when her team need-
ed her the most. The Generals had the
opportunity to get to .500 with a win
against a young Limestone team. Arm-
strong set the tone early, leading the
Generals to a decisive 4-1 win last Fri-
day night, and made some history of her
own in the process.

after two blowout wins over Randolph
Macon College and Sweet Briar, Arrn-
strong made sure they did not.

When asked if the team prepared any
differently against a ﬁrst-year program,
Armstrong said, “No, not at all. Our
mentality is to just go out and play just
like we are playing Lynchburg.”

With this attitude, the Generals

“Getting that goal was simply icing
on the cake. I just want to keep winning
games,” said the ever-humble Ann-
strong.

And Armstrong made sure her team
took the victory.

, The ﬁrst period ended with the Saints
hanging tough and the score still only 1-
0, but W&L came ﬂying out of half-time

The Generals had all week to prepare
for the Saints of Limestone. Their last
game was the Saturday before, when
they had throttled Sweet Briar by a com-
manding score of 5-2.

However, Limestone offered a unique
challenge coming into the game. They
are a ﬁrst-year program boasting a mere
17 players on the roster, 15 of whom
are freshmen. As one could imagine,
the Saints have had their growing pains,
struggling to a 1-8 start to the season.

While it could be very easy to over-
look a squad like Limestone, especially

jumped out to a quick lead just 10 min-
utes into the contest. And none other
than Armstrong herself scored the ﬁrst
goal.

With that goal, Armstrong scored her
43rd career goal, fourth for this season,
and passed Jane Beal ’05 to stand alone
at the top of W&L’s list of ﬁeld hockey
goals scored.

Number 19 in the blue and white was
mobbed by her teammates and received
a rousing ovation as her accomplish-
ment was made known over the stadium
speakers.

and Armstrong again set the tone. She
scored just four minutes into the half off
a beautiful play by senior forward Steph
Mansey.

Mansey pushed the ball all the way
down the left wing, ducking and dodg-
ing Limestone players the whole way,
and feeding the ball into the front of the
net where sophomore forward Christina
Benedetti provided the assist for the
Armstrong goal. Just ﬁve minutes later,
Armstrong tallied her third goal of the
night and Benedetti dished out her third
assist off of a penalty corner.

TOP LEFT: Flrst-year forward Katharlne Price chases down the ball

BOTTOM LEFT: Junlor midfielder Kate Donnelly moves toward the goal
TOP RIGHT: Senlor captain forward Sallie Armstrong cuts off a Limestone

defender

Down 3-0 and failing to have any
sort of extended ball possession, ﬁrst-
year Sara Parker provided a little spark
for Limestone with an unassisted goal.

But the Generals quickly extin-
guished any faint hope the Saints had, as
junior midﬁelder Kate Donnelly buried
a goal off of a feed from junior midﬁeld-
er Emmy Mathews.

Once the ﬁnal horn sounded, the cel-
ebration began. Not only was the great-
est W&L ﬁeld hockey goal scorer of
all time in the house, but the Generals
pushed their record to an even 4-4.

Making the record of most
goals scored “feels pretty good,

said Armstrong. “Jane Beal told me my

freshman year that I would be the one to
break the record. I kind of brushed that
off, but I am just really more concerned
about winning the ODAC. When Jane set
the record, her team won the conference,
so hopefully history repeats itselﬂ”

The Generals fell to Mary Washing-
ton, 3-2, on Sunday. Their next match-up
is at Eastern Mennonite on Wednesday.

To bowl or not to bowl?

Columnist Lee Tackett considers the chances of a non-BCS team makingits way to the BCS championship game

By LeeTackett
COLUMNIST

With a third of the NCAA football
season ﬁnished, it is apparent that the
Bowl Championship Series (BCS) sys-
tem will once again come under intense
scrutiny. With no clear-cut top team,
there is a good possibility that the BCS
conferences will not produce an unde-
feated team at season’s end. And so we
have to ask the timeless question: is this
the year that a team from outside the
BCS gets an opportunity at a champion-
ship? Boise State, Texas Christian and
Houston have stirred up controversy
over their legitimacy as top 15 teams.

Boise State is the elder statesman of
the “mid major” group, with two unde-
feated regular seasons in the past three
years and a win over Oklahoma in the
2006 Fiesta Bowl.

Last year, Boise State was outshined
by another non-BCS team in Utah and
was relegated to a secondary bowl,

where they lost to TCU. Boise State
made a strong statement at the begin-
ning of the season with an impressive
home opener over No. 16 Oregon.

Unfortunately, Boise State has be-
come a victim of its own success and
has struggled to come up with quality
non—conference opponents due to its no-

.toriety and talent level. Coming into this
week, Boise State climbed all the way
up the polls to No.5, the highest regular
season ranking ever for a non-BCS team.
No one can discount Boise State’s win
over Oregon as a program milestone,
but with a weak conference schedule left
to play, it becomes diﬂicult to justify the
Broncos as a top ﬁve team.

Does one win make Boise State bet-
ter than a one—loss team like Virginia
Tech or USC? Probably not, but it is
conceivable that Boise State will contin-
ue to climb up the rankings, as at least

two SEC teams ahead of it are likely to
lose a game this season.

TCU plays in the Mountain West,
the most competitive non-BCS confer-
ence, but has never been able to stake a
true claim toward a BCS bowl. In 2008,
TCU was talked about as a possible
“BCS Buster,” but fell to Oklahoma and
Utah. Thus far, TCU has yet to play a
ranked team, but has two road wins over
the ACC against UVA and Clemson.
TCU will likely get one chance to play
a ranked team when it travels to Provo
in October to play BYU, who knocked
off then—No.2-ranked Oklahoma earlier
this year. If TCU is able to run the table,
it would have a signiﬁcantly stronger
résumé than Boise State. All of its mar-
quee victories will have come on the
road, and its conference schedule is far
more diﬂicult than that of Boise State.

Houston is the true newcomer to this

group. The Cougars have ﬁnally reached
their ﬁnal stages of rebuilding and head
coach Kevin Sumlin has been able to
make Houston relevant again among the
Texas high school football scene. In ad-
dition to an exciting offense, the Cou-
gars have a legitimate Heisman trophy
candidate in junior quarterback Case
Keenum. Houston hasn’t been shy in its
scheduling for 2009. The Cougars have
notched a road victory against then No.5
Oklahoma State and a tough home win
against Texas Tech, but fell to UTEP 58-
41 this Saturday. Unlike TCU or Boise
State, Houston still has a non—confer-
ence game against a major conference
team left on its schedule. Houston will
go on the road to face Mississippi State
next Saturday.

By virtue of the BCS rules, it is near-
ly impossible for three non-BCS con-
ference teams to qualify for BCS bowl

bids. The rule states that if one non-BCS
team ﬁnishes in the top 12 of the BCS
rankings, it must be put in a bowl. The
rule says nothing about the possibility
of three teams not from the power con-
ferences going undefeated. Houston has
a difﬁcult conference schedule to look
forward to in the coming weeks, which
may put it far out of national title con-
tention at season’s end.

But with its current exposure, BCS
voters will see plenty of Houston. TCU
may have a better case to play in a BCS
bowl, as it has taken down better teams
in more adverse environments. But Boi-
se State’s soft remaining schedule and
high pre-season billing may earn the
team a bid to a BCS bowl.

W&L athletics and academics recognized

W&L earns Top 25 ranking in National Collegiate Scouting Association is 2009 Power Rankings

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

An impressive touchdown by a
Washington and Lee running back or
a killer hat trick by a freshman soccer
star may not earn airtime on ESPN. But
W&L athletes are earning another type
of recognition. The Generals may play
hard, but they also work hard.

W&L has been named to the Top
25 of the National Collegiate Scouting
Association’s 2009 Collegiate Power
Rankings. The study highlights the best
schools in the country in terms of both

athletic and academic standards. The
study takes into account the academic
rankings issued by U.S. News &World
Report and the school’s student-athlete
graduation rate.

The study also averages in the results
of the United States Sports Academy
Director’s Cup, which evaluates the
strength of collegiate athletic programs.
Every NCAA and NAIA athletic pro-
gram in the nation is evaluated. W&L
was ranked 21st in the nation, right be-

hind Northwestern University.
Collegiate athletic recruiting isn’t all
about big-name sports schools battling
it out for the nation’s premier athletes.
There are many collegiate athletes who
never see their name on rivals. com, but
go on to be extremely successful in col-
lege athletics. The purpose of the rank-
ings is to provide an additional means to
help prospective athletes make their col-
lege decisions. The NCSA has become
the college recruiting source of choice

for over 35,000 college coaches and
10,000 college athletes.

“The Power Rankings are an objec-
tive tool to empower student athletes to
ﬁnd the right ﬁt in a college or university
not only for its athletics but academics
as well,” said Chris Krause, CEO and
Founder of NCSA. “Our hope is to
educate these student athletes and their
parents on the importance of evaluating
schools that will provide the education
for an enriched, successful career after

college in addition to athletic success.”

Williams College was named No. 1
in the rankings, followed by Amherst
College at No. 2, and Middlebury Col-
lege at No. 3. Other schools included in
the Top 25 are Duke at No. 11, Harvard
University at No. 13, and Yale Univer-
sity at No. 16.

_ W&L women’s tennis racks up titles

The Generals take ﬁrst-place trophies in W&L Fall Festival and I TA Atlantic South Regional

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee women’s
tennis team was out for aces the past
two weekends as the Generals competed
in the W&L Fall Festival and the ITA
Atlantic South Regional at Mary Wash-
ington.

In the Fall Festival, the host team
claimed ﬁrst place in both doubles ﬂights
and two out of the four singles ﬂights.

A total of six Generals advanced to
the championships of the four singles
brackets, with W&L’s two victories
coming from all W&L match-ups. Ju-
nior Catherine Reed defeated ﬁrst-year
Christina Douglas, 6-3, 6-1, to take
the title in the Flight B singles bracket.
First-year Kerry Cotter also earned a

ﬁrst place title with a 6-3, 6-1 win over
junior Crystal Spencer in the Flight D
singles bracket.

Senior Blair Brzeski fell to Katie
Schafer of Mary Washington, 6-0, 6-
1, in the ﬁnals of the Flight A singles
bracket. Brzeski ﬁnished 2-1 overall for
the tournament. Lyndsey Johansson also
took a second place title for the Generals
after falling 6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-4 to Cassie
Bowman of Mary Washington in the ﬁ-
nals of the Flight C singles bracket.

The team then traveled to Freder-
icksburg for the ITA Atlantic South Re-
gional. Fighting through rain delays, the
Generals walked away with two titles.

In the Blue 3 doubles draw, ﬁrst-years

Christina Douglas and Laura Simmons
defeated Betty Edwards and Zannah
Webster of Meredith, 8-0, in the ﬁnals
to claim the championship. Douglas and
Simmons went undefeated for the tour-
nament with wins over DeSales, Wilkes,
and Mary Washington.

Douglas and Simmons were also
the two ﬁnalists for the Blue 2 singles
bracket. The match was played Tuesday
on the W&L courts. Douglas defeated
Simmons, 6-3, 6-4, to claim the cham-
pionship.

A total of eight singles players and
two doubles squads competed in the
main draw for W&L. In the Champion
singles ﬂight, sophomore Jen Snyder

defeated Wilkes’s Xiaogiao Zhang, 6-3,
6-0 and Salisbury’s Melissa Follett 6-1,
6-1 to advance.

Fellow sophomore Ellen Yeatman
easily defeated Shawnte Woodson of
Hollins 6-0, 6-0 in the ﬁrst round. Yeat-
man’s second round match-up proved to
be more of a battle as she defeated Ran-
dolph-Macon’s Lucy Scherrnerhom, 4-
6, 6-4, 6-1.

Brzeski advanced after beating Kat
Cohen of Washington College, 6-1, 6-0,
and Kathym Maples of Meredith, 6-3, 6-
1. Brzeski fell to Wilkes’s Melanie Nolt
in the next round.

In the Blue 1 singles ﬂight, W&L
ﬁrst-year Sallie Griﬂ‘in advanced to the

main draw with a 6-0, 6-0 win over Dina
Zingaro from Swarthmore.

In doubles, sophomores Trelsie
Sadler and Yeatman defeated Christine
Petrilla and Kate Steiner of DeSales, 8-
1, to advance to the main draw of the
Champion doubles ﬂight. Junior Vir-
ginia Dickinson and sophomore Lauren
Lukas also advanced with an 8-0 victory
over Kat Cohen and Kristine Depew
from Washington College.

The team will travel to Hollins next
weekend to compete in the ODAC sin-
gles championships.

W&L falls in lax classic

New player uncertainties hinder the Generals in 15-13 defeat

By Brooke Sutherland
sPoRrs EDITOR

The Washington and Lee men’s la-
crosse team broke a record this weekend.
Unfortunately, it wasn’t a record they were

 

looking to break. The Generals fell to Vir-
ginia Military Institute, 15-13, in the 23rd
Annual Lee-Jackson Lacrosse Classic this
weekend, marking only the third time in
the history of the event that the Generals
have lost to the Keydets.

“VMI was a very senior-laden, ex-
perienced team,” said Head Coach Gene
McCabe. “We had a lot of guys in starting
roles and key roles for basically the ﬁrst
time. I was impressed with a lot of what
we did. I don’t put too much bear-
ing on this loss. I think it’s the sign
of a very good rivalry. Hopefully
we can learn from this and it will
make us better in the spring.”

Struggling with fall ball nerves
and uncertainties, the Generals got
out to a slow start. VMI put up two
goals, but W&L had no answer,
going scoreless in the ﬁrst quarter.

“It was different than in years
past,” said senior team captain at-
tacker Will Keigler. “We were get-
ting used to new players and new
line-ups. It just took us a while to
gel.” -

As the second quarter opened,
VMI continued to dominate, scor-
ing two more goals in the ﬁrst
three minutes to put the score at 4-
0. But a goal from Keigler with the
assist by junior midﬁelder Drew
Koeneman put the Generals on the
scoreboard.

VMI answered the goal with one of
their own, setting the score at 5-1. Now
facing a four-goal deﬁcit, the Generals

' picked up the pace and attacked the VMI

goal. Junior attack Spence Daw cashed in
a goal off an assist from sophomore at-
tacker Sam Mott. Keigler and Koeneman
then combined for another goal to set the
score at 5-3.

“We were able to start to get into a
rhythm,” Keigler said. “We focused on
making the right passes and the right shots.

The coaches made some good adjustments
and we were able to break down the de-
fense and get some good shots.”

The Generals continued their scoring
streak off a goal by Daw from a Keigler
assist. But VMI retaliated two minutes
later to secure its lead at 6-4. The game
was no longer a story of VMI domination,
but the Generals just couldn’t seem to pull
ahead.

W&L got on the board once more for
the half with a goal from Koeneman off an
assist from Keigler. But a VMI goal late in
the second quarter put the Keydets up 7-5

heading into half-time.

W&L came out swinging in the third
quarter. Koeneman attacked immediately,
putting up an unassisted goal less than a
minute into the quarter. But VMI did not
back down. The Keydets ran up two more
goals to put the score at 8-6.

W&L ﬁnally tied the score midway
through the third quarter after a goal by
W&L ﬁrst-year Cooper Brown followed
quickly by another goal from Daw off an
assist from Keigler set the score at 8-8.

The Generals and the Keydets traded
goals back and forth for the rest of the
third quarter. Goals from Brown, Keigler
and Koeneman kept the score tied at 11-11
heading into the fourth quarter.

Scoring slowed in the fourth quar-
ter, but VMI was able to take charge and
hold off the Generals. W&L put up two
more goals, one from senior attacker Max
Mancuso off an assist from Keigler and
another from Koeneman. But four fourth-
quarter goals gave the Keydets a close 15-
13 victory.

“it was a hard-fought game,” Keigler
said. “Both teams played well. We just
came out of it with the short end of the
stick.”

“I thought VMI played very well,”
McCabe added. “They really deserved
to win. We just need to learn to execute
a little better in certain situations. But I
was very pleased with our team’s effort
throughout the whole game.”

McCabe speciﬁcally highlighted the
play of Koeneman and Keigler, who led
the Generals in scoring and assists. Koen-
eman put up four goals and two assists,
and Keigler added three goals and four
assists.

“Koeneman [is a] superstar on the
ﬁeld,” Keigler said. “He deﬁnitely has the
fastest shot, the hardest shot. He can get a
shot off whenever he wants. He’s unstop-
pable.” Keigler added, “He was clearly
the most dominant player on the ﬁeld last
night.”

The Generals have only one week of
fall practice left before they close out their
fall season with the annual homecoming
alumni game Saturday at 5 p.m. on Wilson
Field. ‘

Initially, [the loss] is pretty frustrating,”
Keigler said. “It’s disappointing. It’s up-
setting. But it doesn’t go into our win-loss
column. It’s the fall. It’s early. We have a
lot of young players. And this game is just
a good ﬁrst step towards spring season.”

partying

Panel to discuss
interacting with law
oﬁicials after drinking

By Eleanor Kennedy
smrr wmrzn

Students, Alcohol and the Law, an event which
will include a panel discussion followed by a op-
portunity for students to voice their questions, com-
ments and concerns about enforcement of drinking
laws in Lexington, will take place on Tuesday
October 13 at 7:30 pm. in Stackhouse Theater.

The panel will be composed of members of the
local and county police offices, a local lawyer and
the presidents of the EC and SJC. The panel will
discuss a number of scenarios which students com-
monly face in Lexington and then open the ﬂoor up
for any questions from the audience.

Junior Stephanie Brown is one of the coor-
dinators of the event. Brown said that she and
SJC president Crighton Allen discussed the idea
of a forum about what rights and responsibilities
students have when they are consuming alcohol,
and what they should expect in interactions with
police officers.

“The purpose of this meeting is
to ensure that W&L students are
fully aware of both their rights
and responsibilites should they
ever ﬁnd themselves in a situa-
tion involving alcohol and a law

enforcement oﬁcer. ”
STEPHANIE BROWN, junior

Brown and Allen brought the idea to Dean
Watkins, who informed them that EC president Eric
Hoffman had already been in contact with the police
and the Lexington community on this issue. Brown
and Allen contacted Hoffman, and the three planned
the Students, Alcohol and the Law event.

Brown said: “The purpose of this meeting is to
ensure that W&L students are fully aware of both
their rights and responsibilities should they ever
ﬁnd themselves in a situation involving alcohol
and a law enforcement ofﬁcer.

“It is our hope that common ground can be
reached on what constitutes an appropriate in-
teraction between students and law enforcement
officers.”

She also hopes that the discussion at the meet-
ing will “help students understand how to handle
encounters with the police, increase students’
knowledge of their rights, and underscore the po-
tential consequences of their actions with regards
to the Honor System and the University’s Conduct
Policies.”

Issues that will be covered at the meeting in-
clude drunk in public laws, the effect of the Honor
System on interactions with police, the W&L strike
system and the authority of police at Traveller bus
stops.

The panel has certain scenarios that they have
developed for discussion, but Brown said they
would appreciate any suggestions from the student
body.

Brown said she is hopeful that a large number
of students will attend, since there are currently 99
students planning on attending with another 176
considering coming.

No matter how many people show up, Brown
still believes “that even if it’s only a few people who
learn more about their rights and the law, and can
communicate that to other people, then the event
will have been a success.”

More information about the event can be found
on the Facebook event with the same name. Just in
case some students need more incentive than the
value of knowing their rights in an interaction with
police, food will be provided.

 

Many agree that partying can be
characterized as a huge part of W&L
culture. Partiers head straight to fra-
ternities to participate in various so-
cial activities. Solo cups in hand, stu-
dents seem to think that the fun can
go on for hours. However, several
parties this year have been heavily
regulated, and some have even been
shut down by public safety ofﬁcers.

Rumors of parties being shut
down by campus security ofﬁcers
and students being given strikes by
these ofﬁcers due to their deﬁance of
university policy have permeated the
campus.

According to the Student Right-
To-Know, Equity in Athletics and
Campus Safety (“Clery Act”) Reports,
a public safety officer, “while respon-
sible for the enforcement of rules and
regulations prescribed by the univer-
sity, are not empowered with arrest
authority.” The “Clery Act” also says
that students are “considered adults
and are expected to abide by the laws
of the Commonwealth of Virginia
and federal statutes concerning pos-
session and use of alcohol, illegal
drugs and other unlawful controlled
substances.”

Sigma Phi Epsilon’s band party on
Friday, Sept. 18, though not ofﬁcially
shut down, was heavily regulated by
public safety ofﬁcers. The members

By Valaree Tang
STAFF WRITER

of the fraternity were shocked when a
public safety officer arrived on scene.
Brett Holton, social chair of Sig Ep,
said he believed that they were fol-
lowing what they believed to be the
risk management rules, only to be
confronted by ofﬁcers. When the of-
ﬁcer arrived, underage attendees left
the party when alcohol was not being
served, leaving a mere seven people
at the soirée. The party continued un-
til its scheduled time.

Holton and his fraternity were
under the assumption that as long as
an alcoholic drink was in a Solo cup,
“security wouldn’t bother you.” They
were later informed by a female se-
curity ofﬁcer that that was never the
case for university policy. Sig Ep had
its safety procedures in place, includ-
ing designated sober ofﬁcers, sober
drivers and fraternity brothers on se-
curity.

“It seems as though security is
changing the rules in the middle of
the game and penalizing fraternities
for doing things as they’ve always
done and never been punished for be-
fore,” said Eleanor Kennedy, attend-
ee of two separate parties that were
heavily regulated or shutdown.

It has also been rumored that one
of Sigma Nu’s cocktail parties and
Pi Kappa Phi’s Late Night have also
been shut down—by the very same

public safety ofﬁcer who was present
at Sig Ep’s party.

“The party was singlehandedly
shut down by one security officer:
Kay Bostick,” said Sigma Nu Social
Chair Ken Delecki. He reported that
two other ofﬁcers went to the party
earlier in the night and saw no reason
for concern. “It seems that this secu-
rity officer thinks registering a party
gives them license to harass us as
they please.”

Bostick said that she does not
believe that she is doing anything
outside of the boundaries of her job
description.

Sig Ep is now resorting to pri-
vately hiring other security ofﬁcers to
regulate their parties.

It has been reported that Bostick
is under investigation. Though other
fraternities have formally complained
about the ofﬁcer, these rumors cannot
be conﬁrmed.

Bostick regularly makes multiple
appearances at parties in order to fur-
ther enforce what she believes to be
university policy. She says that she
has not found any parties to be com-
plete compliance with the rules.

“I think it’s only fair if the stu-

‘dents write the rules, and they agree

upon the rules, they ought to com-
ply,” said Bostick, who advises stu-
dents to “party with common sense,

curity cracks down

Public safety takes stricter stance on parties, frats complain

sound judgment and drinking within
personal limits.”

Holton said he considers the tight
regulation to be a hassle.

“If you deny students alcohol in
a safe controlled environment, they
will just go off campus where they’re
no longer in a safe place. They will
make stupid mistakes,” Holton said.
“I think it’s just forcing people into
bad situations.”

Perhaps part of the reason for the
sudden and strict crackdown is due
to “a movement from the administra-
tion of the university to gain a better
hold on compliance to the rules and
regulations pertaining to underage
consumption of alcohol,” according
to public safety director, Mike Young.
A refusal of compliance to the policy
may lead to a party being shut down
and written reports, which may result
in issued strikes or a review of the
fraternity by the IFC.

However, IDs are not being
checked at the door because of the
university’s philosophy of student af-
fairs.

“We want them to be able to enjoy
social events,” said Young. “We want
them to obey the rules and the laws.
We lay it on the students to take their
own responsibility to make sure that
that happens.”

Continuing toreform SF HB

Students and professors offer opinions and solutions on how to ﬁx the hearing process

By Eric Gehman
STAFF WRITER

The Student Faculty Hearing
Board (SFHB) review committee
held its second open forum on Fri-
day, Oct. 9. This was a chance for
students, faculty and other members
of the W&L community to offer their
suggestions and opinions about how
the University handles cases of dis-
crimination, harassment and sexual
misconduct.

Present at the meeting were a vari-
ety of representatives from all areas of
the campus, ranging from the depart-
ment of Women’s and Gender Studies
to former members of the SFHB and
various student- groups, all hoping to
effect change in a system many con-
sider in dire need of reform.

Co-Chair Dean Rod Smolla ex-
pressed that the forums are meant to
help the committee formulate its sug-
gestions and stressed that the group is
still in the process of gathering infor-
mation before it convenes to decide
what reforms to include in its ﬁnal
report.

The ﬂoor opened after a brief in-
troduction of the committee and a
statement from Smolla about the pur-
pose of the meeting. First to offer her
thoughts was Professor Robin -LeB-
lanc, former head of the Women’s and
Gender Studies program and member
of both the Politics department and
the Student Affairs Committee.

LeBlanc criticized the closed na-
ture of the committee, sharing her
concern that “... the structure of the
current ad-hoc committee doesn’t
avail itself to the wealth of expertise
and training possessed by some of
the undergraduate faculty and student
groups.”

“It has now long been the case at
W&L that some students and faculty
are informed, organized and active
on issues such as sexual assault and
harassment,” LeBlanc said. “When

we reach the stage at which these
informed, organized and active com-
munity members are regularly con-
sulted and formally included in deci-
sion making relevant to the expertise,
I will see our institution as having
more honestly committed itself to the
values of civility and honor we aspire
to hold dear.”

The second person to comment
was Philosophy and Women’s and
Gender Studies professor Melina
Bell, who offeredia wealth of sug-
gestions as to how the SFHB should
be overhauled. Bell called it “highly
problematic” that students do not
have more involvement in the se-
lection of SFHB members and even
went on to suggest that a direct elec-
tion of student board members would
be preferable to the current system, in
which the EC appoints two students
to serve on the board and recom-
mends faculty members for appoint-
ment by the Provost.

“I have spoken,” said Bell, “with
many women students who believe,
mistakenly, that as long as one does
not lie, cheat or steal, the EC is ir-
relevant to their lives. However, they
recognize the relevance of the SFHB
to their lives.”

Bell urged the committee to strive
for more consistency in the sanc-
tions and outcomes of cases that the
SFHB hears. She called for a smaller
board composed of a chair, two stu-
dents (one male, one female) and
two faculty members, minimum and
maximum penalties, as well as clear
deﬁnitions of offenses “framed... on
some concepts established in law or
other adjudicatory settings.”

Another vocal participant in the fo-
rum was CAIR Counselor and W&L
alumnus Joel Shinoﬁeld, who asked
for a smaller, faculty-only commit-
tee, more speciﬁc training methods

on sexual assault to be administered
before the start of the school year and
an “independent counsel with no af-
ﬁliation to W&L” for legal advice. He
deplored the size and composition of
the current SFHB, saying that many
students who come to him seeking
help are unwilling to testify in front
of a board of so many members of the
campus community, due to the sen-
sitive and often emotional nature of
such difﬁcult cases.

Kevin Corn, head Resident Advi-
sor for First Years, agreed, claiming
that “we have one of the largest hear-
ing bodics of these sorts of cases,”
and that “students don’t have any
trust that the board will bring any sort
ofjustice.”

Other students voiced similar
opinions, including KEWL president
Catherine Kruse.

“Frankly, I don’t think the SFHB
should have students on it,” she said.
“We, as college students, don’t have
the capacity, knowledge or experi-
ence to handle the cases as well as
others who understand the victim’s
mentality [and] who can stand as role
models for relief.”

The idea that a faculty-only board
would increase the number of re-
ported cases was a widely supported
view, though this also raised concerns
about violating W&L’s long-standing
tradition of student government.

Regardless of the board’s com-
position, however, most agreed that
more thorough training is needed for
all members prior to the start of the
school year and that the SF HB should
be more active in reaching out to the
student body.

Dave Leonard, Dean of First Year
Students, discussed his concern about
the campus climate and attitudes to-
ward alcohol and sexual conduct.

“We very clearly have a lot of cul-

tural issues,” he said. “The culture is
very muddy, and the time has come
to address the situation.” Public pro-
motion to raise awareness about sex-
ual harassment and assault from the
SFHB, similar to the SJC’s campaign
to reduce drunk driving, was also
widely recommended.

While a wide variety of opinions
and criticism were shared throughout
the two hour session, Smolla made it
clear that the committee is still seek-
ing the help and advice of the W&L
community.

“We have been very impressed
with the honesty, thoughtfulness and
intensity of the comments we have
received in our two open sessions,”
Smolla said. “We have already sched-
uled, and continue to schedule, many
additional meetings with groups and
individuals who have asked for the
opportunity to speak privately with
the committee. We are learning a
great deal through the process, and
we continue to encourage the widest
possible participation from the cam-
pus community.”

Still, some expressed concern and
doubt that the student body could
play any signiﬁcant role in the reform
process without any representation on
the board from knowledgeable groups
in the undergraduate community.

As Kruse noted, “it is hard to com-
ment on the process because none of
us really knows what is going on.
While I appreciate that they are ac-
cepting input from clubs like KEWL
and the WGS faculty, none of us are
on the board, so we don’t even know
how much our opinions count.”

Those who wish to submit com-
ments or suggestions can do so by

Why do we need a date to Homecoming?

Butler asks why Homecoming is centered around nothing but fraternities and, for girls, looking pretty for a date . I

By Alelsha Butler
c o L u M N I sr

Ah, Homecoming... that an-
nual event.

That event that draws hordes
of alumni and, apparently, their
toddlers and infants, to cocktail
parties, wine tastings and late-
night band parties. (I’m not kid-
ding. On Saturday night I saw a
newborn at a frat party.) What do
we think of it? How important is

it in the scheme of social events '

that take place around here?
What is the meaning of Home-
coming?

While kicking around these
topics with a few guy friends
who happen to be in a fraternity,
they asked the eternal, unanswer-
able question that hovers around
the social events at W&L: Why
do we need dates for something
like Homecoming?

One of the guys I was talk-

ing with piped up and said it’s
because the undergrads need
to prove to the alurrmi that the
fraternity is still “doing well.”
What does that mean? It seems
that success, in the frat world,

business transaction of sorts.
Because sorority nationals do
not permit alcohol to be served
in sorority houses, women are
not able to host equivalent social
events. Much less frequently do

full roster backing us up. And
everybody who knows anything
about sports knows that winning
an away game is always a little
tougher than a home game.

So, what should we do? Call

It seems that success, in the frat world, is measured by the number of

is measured by the number of
(attractive) girls that attend any
given party or social function.
Like video games to little kids,
the more you have the cooler you
are.

Guys need to prove their
studliness, and girls need a place
to party, so we come up with a

we have the ability to socialize
with our entire Greek afﬁliation,
and the fact that we need to play
the social game at guys’ houses
always makes us the visiting
team.

We never get to play the
world’s most complicated game
on our home turf, or with our

up sorority nationals and tell
them to change their policies?
That probably wouldn’t work,
but you’re welcome to give it a
try.

Instead, maybe we should
reevaluate our partying needs:
why do we need dates? What do
we have to prove? That, male or

female, we’re smooth enough to
harness somebody to us for a 48-
hour period? Score.

Most of the time, I hear
people coming back from date
functions with indifferent or ac-
tually unpleasant stories, and the
people who simply go in groups
of friends, mixed-gender or not,
seem to have the best time. The
pressure to be polite, gracious
and catering to another person’s
enjoyment is so much less if it’s
only your own good time that
you’re worried about.

As one of the guys who helped
me with this article said, Home-
coming is supposed to be about
the alumni. We’re supposed to
welcome them back and enter-
tain them. It provides a good op-
portunity for us to network, and
it lets them feel like they’re 21

again. (Although at W&L, being
21 really isn’t an issue.)

As we all know, the social
scene can get hectic and stress-
ful, especially when we’re host-
ing several graduating—classes’
worth of guests, and throwing
in the added pressure of ﬁnd-
ing dates is kind of unneces-
sary. Most of the events during
this weekend were standing-up,
moving-around kinds of affairs,
not sit-down dinners and hotel
reservations. We would all have a
much better time if, in the future,
we saved the date-snaring for
the really serious, sophisticated
social events. Like Christmas in
the Country. Or Fancy Dress. Or
Pledge Formal.

You know, “classy” stuff.

Welcome to the reality of rape at Washington & Lee

A W&L student shares her experience with rape and begs for an end to the shocking culture of tolerating assault

By Anonymous

Let’s pretend that this year
one out of every four Washing-
ton and Lee students had their
cars stolen. Wouldn’t there be a
campus-wide outrage that pen-
etrated both the students and
administration? We would prob-
ably make national news for that
many car thefts, and the number
one in four would be signiﬁcant.
Why then is this not the reaction
to the number of sexual assaults
that take place on our campus ev-
ery year? Our numbers are about
one in four. Why are these num-
bers so unimportant?

Do not enough victims speak
out? Do we consider it such a me-
dial problem that we are unwill-
ing to do start a dialogue about
ﬁxing it? Do we not understand

how it happens? Do we think it
couldn’t happen to us or to our
friends? Again, our numbers are
about one in four, so it probably,
and almost certainly has hap-
pened to your friends].

My story is not very differ-
ent from that of many women or
men on this campus. I apologize
in advance if it makes you un-
comfortable to read, but some-
thing needs to be done. Maybe if
people are able to identify with
my story, they will realize that
sexual assault is a problem on
our campus. It is a problem that
needs to be addressed. We cannot
ignore it any longer in hopes that
it will go away.

I had met a guy who I thought
was intrigming, and we started to

spend more time together. We
did laundry together once and
had kissed a few times. I liked
how sure of himself he always
seemed, and his friends were
pretty solid. We had hooked up
sober a few times, and when he
asked me to have sex, I declined,
making it clear that I wanted to
wait until I was married (just a
personal preference, but his dif-
ferent views on sex were okay of
course). When we had had a few
drinks, I had the same preference
not to have sex; he tried to push
my limits a few times, but when
I stood my ground, he stopped
asking and settled for other types
of physical affection.

One night, we went to a bar
together with a few friends. Be-
cause I was under 21 at the time,
he bought me shots all night
which I, thinking I was of the
W&L drinking caliber, accepted
without a thought to how much
I was consuming. He had a few
drinks, but was nowhere near
as drunk as I because he had fo-

cused his efforts on getting me
drunk. We went back for the night
where I threw up, a clear sign for
me that my body was not able to
handle the amount of alcohol I
had previously consumed.

We lay in bed and kissed for
a little while when he began tak-

powerless to stop him.

drunken state that I did not want
to have sex (which at this point
should have been crystal clear in
his mind) and he persisted. “Just

and taunted me with “So, babe,
how does it feel not to be a vir-
gin anymore?” and I could only
stare at him. I laughed it off for
a few days, unable to cope with
the experience. Sound like rape
to you?

Rape... what a taboo word.
It conjures thoughts of violence
and sleazy old men taking advan-
tage of stupid, vulnerable wom-
en. On our campus, though, it is
sometimes as simple as someone
saying no, the other person hear-
ing the no, understanding the no
and still deciding that his or her
physical gratiﬁcation is more im-
portant.

I did not want to have sex. He
knew that. In the heat of the mo-
ment I never said yes. I also nev-
er said no with a “Come on baby,
I actually meant yes” grin—my
no was clear. There are men
and women on this campus who
share the same story or share a
similar one.

on our faces and even continue to
hook up with people~—shocking.
Again, the numbers on this cam-
pus are high. Let’s do something
about it.

I don’t know if you’ve
checked lately, but we are two
and a half months away from a
new decade. 2010 does not come
with the same amount of hype as
2000... Nevertheless, it still mat-
ters.

Since you are probably spend-
ing most of your time dealing
with the here and now, you might
not have noticed how truly im-
portant this decade was to our
generation. The Baby Boomers
had the 1960s to ﬁgure them-
selves out. Generation X had
the 1990s to complain about the
world and make their everlasting
mark. Our generation? We had
the 2000s.

If you really stop and think
about it, the last 10 years were
primarily about our generation.
Basically, everyone who is in the
age range to be an undergrad here
has been the cultural center of at-
tention for the last 10 years.

Don’t believe me?

Who do you think 98 Degrees,
O-Town, Christina Aguilera, and
Destiny’s Child were marketing
to when they all released music
in 2000?

Why do you think the gradu-
ating classes of “The OC.” and
“Gossip Girl” were 2006 and
2009 respectively?

Why did Nickelodeon and
Cartoon Network suddenly not
have any programming ideas
once we hit puberty?

Why did the R—Rated come-
dies start coming back into fash-
ion once we did hit puberty?

Starting to make some sense?
Now, some of you may be think-
ing that since you were anywhere

from the age of 8 to the age of 12
in 2000, you can’t really be the
most important cultural entity.
You are supposed to be in your
prime from 16-29, and anything
outside of that does not really
count.

While that argument does hold
some merit, let’s face it: from our
perspective, life basically ends
once you leave college. Seniors
are already looking for jobs, and
most have already come to terms
with the reality that their gradua-
tion present will most likely be a
minivan and a 401K portfolio.

Face it. These last ten years
were basically all geared to peo-
ple who were born between 1987
and 1992. We just matter more
than everyone else.

So while you are contemplat-
ing that pretty heavy fact (and
maybe wondering how the hell
I was able to remember who 0-
Town was), let me tell you anoth-
er pretty interesting thing about
our now clearly deﬁned genera-
tion: we have a catch phrase!

Other famous generations
have had catch phrases as well.
The Baby Boomers had “free
love” and Generation X had
“keeping it real.” Other gen-
erations, especially the lesser-
known ones might also have had
catch phrases, but since by now
they are over 30, do we even care
anymore? Yeah, I thought so.

Anyway, our generation,

which I like to call Generation
“ADDerall” (I’m not sure if it’s
going to catch on), has a catch
phrase: “I don’t even care.” Now,
you might not have said this
phrase that many times in your

life, but that’s only because you
probably substituted it with “give
an [expletive].”

And since apparently curses
still aren’t allowed in newspa-
pers, I’m going to stick with
“care.”

Being raised in incredibly
passive-aggressive households,
we were trained from birth to not
even care. In pre-school, the Baby
Boomers were taught to share
the ﬁre truck with their friends.
The Generation Xers were taught
to ﬁnd a true friend that they
could trust to share with. Our
generation? We were taught that
it doesn’t really matter whether
someone takes our ﬁre truck or
not because N64 was much more
important anyway.

This example isn’t supposed to
imply that we were more spoiled
as children. Every generation’s
lifestyle has it a little better than
the generation before it, but we
can now complain that the iCarly
generation has life way too easy.

Our generation was deﬁnitely
not an outrageously spoiled gen-
eration. Instead, we just ﬁgured
out a way not to care who was
playing with our ﬁre truck. Sim-
ple as that.

Now that we’re grown up, we
still show that we just don’t care.
Back in the good ole days, the
Baby Boomers at parties would
try and convince members of
the opposite sex to come back
to their place to listen to the Jimi
Hendrix Experience, take some
substances, and go through with
“free love” ﬁrsthand.

A decade ago, the Generation
Xers would invite members of

the opposite sex to come back to
their place to listen to some qual-
ity grunge music, drink some
coffee, talk about real things in
the world like democratization
and globalization, and maybe if
there was some time left over, get
to really know each other. Basi-
cally, Generation X was that gen-
eration who used italics a little
too much.

When we try and seduce po-
tential mates at parties, we use
slightly different tactics to do so.

A typical pick-up line among
the kids in our generation goes a
little something like this: “Hey,
I mean, you don’t have to, but if
you want to come by my place,
we can just chill for a while, lis-
ten to a little Jack Johnson, and
I don’t know, maybe something
will happen. I mean, it’s not that
big a deal and I don’t really care,
but there is this funny Youtube
video that you’d probably like,
and who knows what can happen
from there?”

Okay, there probably has
never been a pickup line like that
ever, but I had throw in one or
two pop culture references.

Regardless, how many times
have you been shut down by that
potential hookup only to return
to your friends and tell them that
you didn’t even care in the ﬁrst
place? 20? 30? Okay, maybe it’s
just me.

Look, you might not have ever
had these thoughts. You might
completely disagree with every-
thing that I just wrote about.

But that’s the great thing
about this generation. I don’t
even care.

Why did we elect the Nobel prom king as president?

Abel Delgado laments the decision to award President Obama the Nobel Peace Prize after just nine months in office

By Abel Delgado
co LU M N I sr

Someone should go check
Alfred Nobel’s grave and see if
his bones are still rolling from
the news that broke early Friday
morning. Seeing the prestigious
award he founded turn into a po-
liticized stunt honoring people
for what hopefully might happen
would probably upset him quite
a bit.

President Obama only needed
to be president for 10 days before
he was nominated for the once-
impressive Nobel Peace Prize.
He needed just nine months in
the White House to convince the
committee he was worthy of an
award that has honored such ac-
complished individuals as Nel-
son Mandela, Elie Wiesel and
Mother Theresa. So what exactly
did he do to merit his name being
mentioned in the same breath?

 

One would assume most of
the work that qualiﬁed him was
done during the campaign. So

to the other, something entirely
common in American history.
Was it historically signiﬁcant be-

Imagine being declared valedictiorian your

freshman year in the hope that you would

get outstanding grades.

was it for winning the election
and uniting the country? Well, he
certainly won the election but if
he has united anyone lately, it’s
the opposition.

His election was not some
sort of radical revolution or
movement towards democratiza-
tion, either. It was just a peaceful
transfer of power from one party

cause of his racial background?
Of course, but I’m sure he would
refuse an award for simply that.
Furthermore, his campaigns
against Hillary Clinton and John
McCain weren’t exactly “peace-
ful.” His opponents attacked his
lofty rhetoric pretty hard, but he
and his staff were never the type

to hold ﬁre.

A response to porn

Lauren Miller criticizes Stockton Bullitts view that porn
does not degrade women or contribute to sexual assault

I don’t normally feel com-
pelled to respond to articles I
read and I don’t typically write
“letters to the editor.” However,
I found that I could not read
Stockton Bullitt’s recent piece,
entitled “Pomography is not so
evil” without responding to his
views, especially if to remain
silent would indicate a tacit
agreement with his opinions.

Although he brings up some
thought-provoking points for
discussion, I strongly disagree
with the premise of his article
that pomography has no impact
on men’s view of women. Mr.
Bullitt argues, “Pomography
cannot be considered an inher-
ently misogynistic entity.”

Ask almost any woman,
and she will tell you that porn
is completely degrading and
treats women as sex objects.
Just because many men don’t
believe that porn debases wom-
en does not mean that it doesn’t.
It is always easy for people to
believe that a situation is entire-
ly acceptable when they aren’t
on the receiving end of objecti-
ﬁcation and disrespect.

Mr. Bullitt claims, “Men do
not view women differently be-
cause of what they see in porn,
especially when it comes to
rape . . . I have never met any
guy whose view of women has
been altered thanks to what he
has seen late at night online.”

He is right to the extent that
there has not yet been a study
that has conclusively shown a
positive correlation between
pornography and rape. Howev-
er, it is irrational to assume that
just because porn theoretically
does not “cause” rape, it also
has absolutely no impact on the
way men perceive women.

I am wondering how any of
us, male or female, can make
that claim with conﬁdence. How
can you know with certainty
that porn has absolutely no ef-
fect on a guy’s View of women?
The fact is that some men hold
a view of females which tends
towards sexism or which objec-
tiﬁes women.

This view is not inherent, as
it obviously doesn’t exist in ev-
ery guy. The fact that sexism is
far from just a “guy thing” that

can’t be avoided would suggest
that any misogynistic view of
women which men might hold
is learned from cultural inﬂu-
ences.

Some of the most salient of
these inﬂuences are found in
the media which people choose
to consume: television, music,
movies and, of course, pomog-

' stake here is respect more than

anything else. I have yet to meet
any ﬁrst-year female say some-
thing like, “I feel degraded and
objectiﬁed by being assigned to
the top ﬂoor of my dorm.” Yet
I have heard many women say
that they feel degraded by pom
or feel that the very existence of
the porn trade exploits women’s

men perceive women.

raphy. What you watch and lis-
ten to does affect you. It may
not always directly change your
actions (after all, Mr. Bullitt is
right that porn does not neces-
sarily cause rape), but it can and
does have a strong inﬂuence on
your attitudes. And are not atti-
tudes what, in turn, lead to ac-
tions?

Mr. Bullitt asserts that on
our campus “there are much
bigger issues that contribute to
the problem of misogyny than
pornography.” As an example
of one of these issues which he
believes help to create sexism,
he mentions the way that ﬁrst-
year women occupy the upper
two ﬂoors of the dorms, while
ﬁrst-year men get the bottom
ﬂoors.

I ﬁnd myself struggling to
understand what is so “sexist”
about this arrangement. It seems
to me that following that logic,
it would be an equally sexist
proposition to put the women on
the lower ﬂoors and the men on
the top ones, or that perhaps it
is “sexist” to have the ﬁrst-year
men and women attend their re-
quired sexual assault seminars
in single-sex groups.

But yet, according to Mr.
Bullitt, that issue and others
like it contribute far more to
problems of sexism and the rise
of misogyny than pornography
does. -

I believe that the issue at

It is irrational to assume that just because

bodies for men’s sexual arousal
and gratiﬁcation.

Mr. Bullitt concludes by stat-
ing that “blaming bad actions
on abstract inﬂuences is always
easy to do.” I agree with him to
the extent that we should not
blame the porn industry when a
rape occurs, just as we ought not
blame the gun industry when a
school shooting takes place or
blame the dining hall when we
gain the freshman 15.

Yes, people are responsible
for their own actions and choic-
es, regardless of the inﬂuences
from which they might emerge.

Nevertheless, people still
need to be aware of how the me-
dia they consume affects their
attitudes. It is wrong to assume
that a form of media which
most women ﬁnd completely
degrading and obj ectifying does
not predispose men to internal-
ize—and perhaps act on-the
misogyny they might be watch-
ing at 2:00 in the morning in
their dorm rooms.

So what was it? One Nobel
Prize Committee member said
it was because he has “changed
the global mood.” The commit-
tee members also spoke of all the
great initiatives President Obama
has mentioned, but not accom-
plished, or even started for that
matter. When asked why they
didn’t they just wait until one of
those initiatives actually had tan-
gible results, they lamented that
there was no way of knowing for
sure that that day would come,
but stated that the award would
surely help him get there. Imag-
ine being declared Valedictorian
your freshmen year in the hope
that you would get outstanding
grades.

It is now obvious that Europe
is quite happy with Obama. The
Nobel Prize is a distinctly Eu-

ropean—run institution, which is
why they do not care about Chi-
nese dissidents and Iranian free-
dom Twitterers. In all honesty,
Twitter probably had more to
do with spreading freedom and
peace this year than President
Obama did.

Not all Europeans are blind
to this, though. Former Polish
President and Nobel Peace Prize
Winner Lech Walsea summed up
the feelings of the level-headed
Europeans by proclaiming, “So
soon? Too early. He has no con-
tribution so far. He is only begin-
ning to act.”

What’s more, the opinion of
Americans on this is about as
close to being united as I have
seen on any issue as of late. No
Democrat, Obama supporter or
even Obama campaign staffer

has tried to defend this to me.
Ironically, even those who
saw the Obama during the cam-
paign as a false prophet of sorts
have to admit that this is not his
fault. He did not ask for the prize,
and he looks a little embarrassed
by it. Pundits are already yapping
about how this will hurt him.

I think it won’t. I hope some of
what he wants to accomplish on
the global scale actually gets ac-
complished. But this issue shows
that when you turn politics into a
popularity contest, you might get
a prom king for president.

Brealdng the silence

Students have power to speak up and change trend of abuse

On October 1, Catharine
MacKinnon, a renowned legal
scholar and women’s rights ad-
vocate, spoke to a full crowd in
Lee Chapel.

In her speech discussing the
relationship between gender in-
equality and the sex industry,
MacKinnon spoke out against
the use of sexual violence against
women as a tool for obtaining
power.

As we sat in the crowd listen-
ing to MacKinnon’s thoughtful,
albeit biting, words, we were
struck by the similar dynamic
of gender inequality and sexual
assault that is disturbingly preva-
lent on our campus.

national statistic that one in four
women will be sexually assault-
ed in college, this means that at
W&L, fully half of your female
classmates will be sexually as-
saulted in their four years here.

More than horrifying, this
number is unacceptable. T00 of-
ten, the half (or more) of us are
silent, convinced that our situ-
ation is rare, invalid, or worse,
hopeless.

Like the women MacKinnon
discussed, those exploited by
the media and the pornography
industry, women on campus are
submitting to a cycle of abuse
and silence.

Our silence enables sexual as-

Our silence enables sexual assault to re-

main hidden from the portrait of integrity

and honor that is advertised as the deﬁning

quality of W&L.

According to W&L’s data
from the 2008 National College
Health Assessment, female stu-
dents on this campus are twice as
likely to have experienced sexual
assault as compared to the aver-
age college woman. Given the

sault to remain hidden from the
portrait of integrity and honor
that is advertised as the deﬁning
quality of W&L. Until this ugly
truth is seriously addressed, the
values of our community will
continue to be compromised.

MacKinnon closed with a
fable about a Native American
sage speaking with two men.
Trying to prove her powerless,
they brought a bird in their hands
and asked her, “Is this bird alive
or dead?” If she said it was alive,
they planned to crush it; if she
told them it was dead, they would
set it free. Aﬂer a few minutes,
the sage ﬁnally spoke up. She
said, “I do not know if it is dead
or alive. It is in your hands.”

Like the sage in this story,
women at W&L constantly face
this catch-22: we cannot pro-
tect ourselves by being silent,
but if we speak out, we may be
crushed.

Fortunately for us, we can
speak out, we can change. Sex-
ual assault does not have to be a
crippling force in this commu-
nity. The choice is up to us. It is
in our hands.

moe. jams for Homecoming

Band draws crowd and shows talent at this year is concert, even if solos feel a little too long

This year’s Homecoming concert
featured moe., a jam band formed in
the 19905. The concert, put on by the
General Actlvities Board, was held in
the Pavlllon on Wednesday.

By Wlll Mays
STAFF WRITER

The lights dimmed and the air was hazy with a light fog of
smoke as moe. took the stage last Wednesday for Washington
and Lee’s Homecoming concert. Though the band only played 12
songs including the encore, band members played their speciﬁc
blend of jam rock for nearly two and a half hours.

A crowd that initially seemed mostly populated by students
gave way by the end of the night to a wave of local residents, and a
few who would have been more at home in the tents of Bonnaroo.
At times, the antics of some of these tie—dye-clad outsiders were
arguably more exciting than what was going on onstage. .

To say that the gentlemen of moe. are talented would be an
understatement, and there were times the band would jam for 20
minutes or more on the same motif. To some, these self-indulgent
grooves were the best part of the show, but many others found the
jamming to be boring. The band played really well, but, as one tired
student put it, “I remember when concerts had words.”

When moe. wasn’t churning out ﬁery solos for seemingly
half—hours at a time, they were unanimously excellent. The whole
crowd, student and local alike, cheered along when the band
broke into a cover of Pink Floyd’s, “Time,” and concert-goers
remaining at the end of the show swayed and sang with the hit
“Okayalright.”

Overall, the band seemed to be well-received, even if some
students didn’t quite understand the concept of a jam band. They
also managed to draw one of the more eclectic crowds W&L’s
pavilion is likely to receive. Those attending walked away happy
for the most part, and the band put on a show worth attending.

1. Close games trip up Generals

The men is soccer team dropped two games over the week, losing to Virginia Wesleyan, I-0, and Roanoke, I-0.

STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s men’s soc-
cer fell to Roanoke, 1-0, on Saturday
leaving the Generals with a record of 3
- 4 - 3. Neither team scored in the ﬁrst
half, but the Maroons added a point
to the board in the 69th minute with a

goal from their junior defender Michael
Stark.

The Generals fought a close game,
but were unable to get their shots on
goal before the clock ran out. Junior
goalie and Captain Ben Bartlett had

three impressive saves throughout the
match.

Roanoke is ranked second in the
ODAC with a record of 6 - 3 - 1 and
its victory over the Generals marks
its fourth win in a row. Seated behind
Lynchburg, the defending ODAC
champions displayed great defensive
play. As a result, Roanoke ﬁrst-year
goalie Ryan Russell only needed one
save to shut out the Generals.

The 1-0 score makes the game
seem like a clear win for Roanoke, but
questions of clean play and fair offi-
ciating abounded in Saturday’s game.
Call after call was met with hysterical,
frustrated responses from the crowd
and players alike in the second half.

The Generals’ defeat was their sec-
ond of the week after falling to Virgin-
ia Wesleyan 1-0 last Wednesday.

“It was incredibly frustrating to lose
1 — 0 for the second time in a row,” said
sophomore forward Huntley Johnson.
“But it’s great to know we can play
with anybody in the ODAC and have a
chance to win the tournament”.

Senior captain Drew Crowley add-
ed that he was proud to see how much
heart his teammates showed on the
ﬁeld.

The Generals’ regular season record
thus far doesn’t give fair credit to the
ability of this team. Stand-outs like
junior forward James Pymm and ﬁrst-
year forward Dave Phillips have given
the Generals a strong offensive pres-
ence on the ﬁeld.

The optimism of the captains and
younger players alike is justiﬁed in
strong leadership, talent, and athleti-
cism. Their consistent and even play

STEELE BURROW / Staff Photographer

against tough teams in the ODAC like
Roanoke suggests that the Generals
could do very well when tournament
play starts up in the coming weeks.
Nothing is set in stone; a tournament
championship is still a possibility.

The Generals will look to improve
their tournament chances when they
face off against ODAC foe Emory &
Henry in a road game this Wednes-
day.

Generals take a tie over Lynchburg to stay on top of conference
W&L women 3 soccer tied Lynchburg 0-0 in double overtime on Saturday for a 9-1-1 overall record, 7-0-1 in ODAC

By Adam cancryn
STAFF WRITER

Facing perhaps its toughest test of
the season, the Washington and Lee
women’s soccer team battled ODAC ri-
val Lynchburg College to a 0-0 double-
overtime tie on Saturday. 3

The draw gave the Generals (9-1-1,
7-0-1 in the ODAC) a conference-lead-
ing 23 points and kept them on track to
capture the No. 1 seed.

A steady rain greeted the teams at
kickoff, creating slick conditions that
hampered both offenses. Simple touches
and throw-ins became challenging on
the wet ﬁeld, making it difﬁcult for both
Lynchburg and W&L to generate much
possession play. With long offensive
runs proving futile, the match quickly
turned into a mid-ﬁeld battle, marked by
solid defense on each side.

“The rain deﬁnitely makes it more

difficult,” said sophomore keeper Emily
Leary. “I’m not a fan of playing in the
rain, but you do what you have to do.
Both teams are playing with it.”

Still scoreless going into the second
half, Lynchburg put early pressure on
the Generals’ back line. But they could
not ﬁnd the net as each scoring opportu-
nity was tumed away.

Though the second half provided
more end—to-end action, the Generals
could not capitalize on their chances
either. With starting sophomore striker
Kat Barnes injured, sophomore forward
Allie Espina moved to the top of the for-
mation, where she manufactured W&L’s
best scoring chance of the day. Follow-
ing a Lynchburg turnover in its own
end, ﬁrst-year midﬁelder Katie Howard
found Espina in the middle of the ﬁeld.

She slipped by the last defender but put
the one-on-one shot just over the cross-
bar.

The match served as yet another
showcase of W&L’s dominant defense,
as its opponent was blanked for the
ninth time in 11 games. Leary recorded
four saves, two of them coming in the
ﬁnal minutes of overtime. The Generals
have now given up just one goal in con-
ference play.

“I have so much conﬁdence in the
defense,” Leary said. “It’s been phenom-
enal; they’re the heart of our team.”

The tie was the ﬁrst overtime game
played by W&L since September 2008.

“We play to win the game  but
once you get into that second overtime
period, there’s certain things you do to
play more conservative,” said coach

Neil Cunningham. “[The defense] was
big today and they’ve done exactly what
they’ve been doing all season.”

With only three ODAC matches left,
W&L is in complete control of its desti-
ny. The tie, coupled with their 3-0 defeat
of Eastern Mennonite on Wednesday,
puts the team four points ahead of its
closest competitor, Virginia Wesleyan.
In addition. W&L owns the tiebreaker,
having beaten Virginia Wesleyan 4-1
earlier in the year.

“We come away from this game feel-
ing good,” Leary said. “As much as we
would’ve liked to win, a tie is one that
we’re satisﬁed with now.”

Of W&L’s next three opponents,
only Bridgewater College holds a win-
ning conference record. A ﬁrst-place ﬁn-
ish would give the Generals the top seed

in the ODAC tournament.

The key to success will be the asser-
tive play of the W&L defense, a unit that
has become the backbone of the team.
With Barnes lost to injury, the Generals
expect to play more defensively-minded
until its offense can regroup. Espina,
who scored the ﬁrst goal against Eastern
Mennonite and leads the team with sev-
en, along with ﬁrst-years Ainsley Daigle
and Katie Howard, will be expected to
pick up the slack on the scoring end.

“It changes things a lot because
[Barnes] is such a good player and such
an inﬂuential player on our team,” Cun-
ningham said. “So we’ve had to adjust,
and I’m just pleased by the way the kids
responded.”

W&L volleyball kicks off a five-game winning streak  

The Generals claimed a home victory over Lynchburg and went 4-0 in the Averett Invitational to get to .500 mark

Washington and Lee volleyball team
is on a roll. The Generals led a ﬁve-
game winning streak through the week,
posting up a 3-2 victory over Lynchburg
on Wednesday and four straight victo-
ries over Averett, Roanoke, Greensboro,
and Ferrum in the weekend Averett In-
vitational.

W&L defeated Lynchburg 3-2 on
Wednesday in the “Dig Pink” match
that raised awareness and funds for
Breast Cancer Awareness and Research."

Raising money for such a good cause
was motivation in its own right, but the
Generals were also looking to make a
statement out on the court.

“I’m interested in a win,” said junior
middle blocker Louise Brooks.

The Generals stepped up to hand
Lynchburg its ﬁrst league loss of the
season.

In the ﬁrst game, Lynchburg came
out ﬁring to take the game 21-25. The
Generals then battled and took the next

two sets, 25-21 and 27-25. But a 23-25
loss in the fourth game sent the match to
a ﬁnal deciding ﬁfth game.

W&L battled to win the ﬁfth game
15-10 to take the victory. With the win,
W&L improved to 6-10 on the season
and 4-2 in the ODAC.

Three hitters posted double-digit kill
totals and led the Generals’ offensive
attack. Brooks and sophomore middle
blocker Lindsey Dee posted 13 kills each
and junior outside hitter Marah Schmitz
chipped in 12 kills. Senior setter Kristi
Stevens also stimulated the offense with
a season-high 42 assists.

First-year libero Cameron Hill led
the defense with 20 digs, and junior
defensive specialist Summer Goldberg
posted 12 digs. Sophomore outside hit-
ter Megan Daily added 13 digs and eight
kills.

“This was an awesome match,” said
Dee. “We were able to ﬁght through be-
ing down and work our way out of some

tough spots. Going to ﬁve games and I

getting a win is great. Defeating an un-
defeated ODAC team at home on a night
like Dig Pink is just really special.”

Following Wednesday’s match, W&L
traveled to the Averett Invitational.

The Generals opened with a game
against the host team. The Generals took
command early and won 3-1, with scores
of 25-13, 24-26, 25-20, and 28-26.

“The whole team was so into this
match,” said ﬁrst-year Right Side Bai-
ley Walker. “We wanted to come out
strong after our big win over Lynchburg
and build off it, and push our winning
streak.”

Key contributions from the game
came from junior setter Jenna Finger
with seven service aces and 13 digs and
from Stevens with 30 assists. Brooks led
the offense with a team-high 12 kills.
Daily added eight kills and 14 digs. Hill
provided a consistent defensive pres-
ence with 29 digs.

After 25 minutes of rest, the Gener-
als were back on the court against Roa-
noke. The Generals swept the Maroons

in three straight games. With scores of ‘

25-12, 25-23, and 25-20, the Generals
set the tempo and never looked back.

Stevens had 37 assists as well as nine
digs. Hill had a team-high 21 digs. On
the offensive side, Daily had 14 kills and
ﬁve digs while Brooks added 8 kills.

The Generals returned to action on
Saturday with a game against Greens-
boro. The Generals made short work of
the Pride winning 3-0.

Brooks led a balanced offense with
10 kills, ﬁve blocks and seven digs.
Daily added nine kills. Hill and Finger
each had a team-high 12 digs and Finger
added contributed service aces. Stevens
posted 27 assists to pace W&L.

“This game was similar to what we
will face in the ODAC toumament: a
late game on Friday and hav[ing] to play
early on Saturday,” said senior setter

Megan Steinhardt.

In the fourth game of the weekend,
the Generals defeated Ferrum 3-0 to ex-
tend its winning streak to ﬁve matches
and ﬁnish the Averett Invitational with a
perfect 4-0 record. With scores of 25-16,
25-15 and 25-16 the Generals are now
10-10, getting to the .500 mark for the
ﬁrst time this season.

Senior Rachael Phillips posted a
team-high 15 kills to lead the offense.
Schmitz chipped in seven kills and se-
nior right side Kelly Harrison added six
kills. Stevens recorded 36 assists and
Goldberg contributed 14 digs. At the
end of the tournament, Brooks and Ste-
vens were both named to the All-Tour-
nament Team.

“I feel like our team really clicked
this weekend, and I am excited to see
where this team is headed,” said ﬁrst-
year middle blocker Stephanie Malaska.

W&L will return to action on Tuesday
with an ODAC match at Sweet Briar.

Homecoming victory

The Generals improved to 2-4 with a 28-14 win over Catholic on Saturday

smrr warren

Washington and Lee rebounded from
a tough loss at Randolph-Macon with a
decisive homecoming victory over the
Catholic Cardinals, 28-14.

The running game carried the Generals
through the game, picking up several key
first downs in the fourth quarter to protect
the lead and keep the clock running. The
Generals totaled for 316 yards rushing,
also adding all four touchdowns on the
ground.

Sophomore running back Jonathan
Clemo gained 137 yards and a touchdown
on twenty-three carries, and sophomore
running back Harrison Hudson added 76
yards and a touchdown on ﬁve carries.

Although the combined running attack
of Clemo and Hudson seemed to be the
focus of the offense on Saturday, sopho-
more quarterback Charlie Westfal added
a strong performance on the ground, run-
ning for 63 yards and a touchdown in ad-
dition to going 5-9 on passing for the day.

The game started with an early Catho-
lic touchdown on a 36-yard run from run-

 

ning back Rick Barry. However, Washing-
ton and Lee responded quickly, putting
up three touchdowns in a row to bring the
lead to 21-7 early in the second half.

The Generals were able to overcome
a late-game push by the Cardinals, who
brought the game to 21-14 with a 1-yard
quarterback sneak with 6:24 left in the
third quarter.

Perhaps the most important play of the
game came in the fourth quarter with just
6:47 remaining, as ﬁrst-year running back
Brett Murray scored on a perfectly timed
option from Westfal from 35 yards out on
fourth and three.

The play capped a decisive drive for
the Generals that kept Catholic from ral-
lying in the fourth quarter.

Defensively, the Generals were led by
sophomore linebacker Rob Look with 12
total tackles and senior Gus Cavanaugh
with 10.

“It was our ﬁrst really well-rounded
game,” Westfal said. “It was a complete
game, with the offense putting up points
and the defense coming up with big plays
throughout the game. Special teams were

also a huge factor, as we were able to limit
mistakes and never really let Catholic
back come back.”

The Generals responded well to the
homecoming crowd, sporting their blue
in honor of the ﬁrst “blue-out” in W&L
history. Although there still were plenty
of other colors in the stands; the crowd
was deﬁnitely the largest of the year, with
about 1200 in attendance.

The Generals are looking forward to the
biggest game of the season to date coming
up next weekend at Hampden-Sydney.

“The team is really clicking at this
point, but we have a huge week in front
of us,” Westfal said. “Hampden-Sydney is
always a very good team and it’s going to
be a big conference game for us.”

With plenty of conference matches left
this season, the Generals are looking to
build on this win to reverse their recent
three-game losing streak.

“That was deﬁnitely a huge win for
us,” said sophomore tight end Jake Tun-
ney. “The team looked really good and I
think this will help build some momentum
going into next Saturday.”

A win and a loss for field hockey

The Generals lost to Eastern Mennonite, 6-0, but rallied to defeat
Bridgewater, 5-0, to improve to 5-6 overall, 3-2 in ODAC play

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s ﬁeld hockey
season has been a roller coaster, from a 1-
4 start to the season to a three-game win
streak, and from a heartbreaking loss to
Lynchburg to Sallie Arrnstrong’s career
goals record. And this week was no differ-
ent. The team lost 6-0 to Eastern Menno-
nite University on Wednesday and turned
right around and blanked Bridgewater 5-0
on Saturday.

W&L (5-6, 3-2 ODAC) traveled to
Eastern Mennonite with hopes of upend-
ing the undefeated conference leaders.

Unfortunately, the Royals came out ﬂy-
ing and dashed any possible thoughts of
an upset, scoring ﬁve goals in the ﬁrst
half alone.

A bright spot in the game was ﬁrst-
year goalkeeper Kirsten Kyne who came
in with 15 minutes left in the ﬁrst period
and stopped 9 shots the rest of the way.
However, the Generals were unable to get
any offense started as the Royals posted a
dominant 31-14 shot advantage.

“We just did not have the right mind-
set,” ﬁrst-year midﬁelder Chelsea Ste-

venson said of the loss. ‘‘It was a deﬁnite
wake-up call”.

And wake up they did. The Generals re-
turned home and blasted Bridgewater 5-0
on Saturday. The team many had plenty of
motivation for their homecoming game.

“We were playing for something other
than ourselves on Saturday”, Stevenson
said. “ It was a game for breast cancer, we
were looking to get back on track, and it
was homecoming. We were ready to go”.

With all these factors in W&L’s favor,
the Generals lit up the scoreboard on an
otherwise overcast day. Senior midﬁelder
Grace McGee started the barrage with a
goal off of a penalty stroke just six min-
utes into the game.

Three minutes later, senior forward
Armstrong hammered home goal num-
ber two with an assist from sophomore
forward Christina Benedetti. The team
locked it down on defense and headed into
halftime still up 2-0.

The story did not change in the second
period. The Generals kept the pedal to the
metal and put away the Eagles with three

more goals before time expired.

F irst-year Ashley Barnes scored unas-
sisted, senior forward Steph Mansey net-
ted a goal with an assist from ﬁrst-year
forward Katharine Price, and Sallie Ann-
strong capped off the day with a goal off
an assist from Mansey.

Kyne and senior goalkeeper Caro-
line Habliston both saw time in goal and
helped post the season’s ﬁrst shutout.

If the team did not have the right mind-
set versus EMU, they deﬁnitely did versus
Bridgewater. They were focused and mo-
tivated, and with the skill they have, that
is a lethal combination for any opponent
to face.

"The Generals have ﬁve more regular
season games before the ODAC playoffs
start on Halloween.

“We are most deﬁnitely looking to get
our revenge in the tournament,” Stevenson
said.

The Generals’ next game is against
Roanoke at home on Tuesday.

W&L lzostsﬁrst annual
festival for alumni of 50
years or more

By Chelsea Stevenson
8 TA F F W R I T E R

What do a former D1 scholarship football player,
a Pulitzer Prize winner for his book on news media
and a 1939 college graduate have in common? Along
with 75 other men, these three distinguishable W&L
alums were all on campus last week for the first annual
Five-Star General alumni festival. This is an honor-
ary festival for W&L alums who have previously
celebrated their 50th college reunion.

During these three days, 75 W&L alums came
from all over the country, including Los Angeles,
Chicago and Atlanta, to attend a serious of programs
and a concluding dinner in Evans Hall, with students
and President Ruscio.

One panel in particular was focused on the changes
in W&L athletics. W&L alum Bill McHenry, who at-
tended W&L on a D1 football scholarship in the 1950’
s and who became the W&L athletic director from
1971-1958 sat on this panel with the current athletic
director Janine Hathom and the director who served
between their terms. Following this presentation,
several alums raved about the new Wilson Stadium.

A second outstanding program was presented by
Alex Jones, ‘68. Mr. Jones, a current news media
and journalism professor at Harvard, is a 1987 Pu-
litzer Prize winner. His presentation focused on his
current role in media today and his views on serious
reporting.

The alumni ofﬁce put a signiﬁcant amount of
planning to make this event happen and to make it
stand out among their other alumni events. Executive
Director of Alurrmi Affairs Mr. Waller Dudley said the
ofﬁce, “tried to create a very different, custom-made
event, and give [it] all the attention we can muster.”

Dudley said the alumni ofﬁce wanted to create a
separate festival for the Five—Star Generals because
the annual Reunion Weekend in May was becoming
too large and too difﬁcult to program for alums rang-
ing from 25 to 85 years old.

Now, the alumni ofﬁce hopes to host three reunion
weekends a year. The ﬁrst will continue to be over
homecoming, but will be focused on alums from the
past ten years, with a special plan to increase the
engagement of young alums.

This year’s Young Alumni Weekend was a large
success, with an attendance passing several hundred.
The all-time single class record was also broken this
year, with 128 members of the class of 1999 celebrat-
ing their tenth-year reunion.

Following homecoming will be the Five-Star
General Festival, which will be held sometime in the
late fall each year. Finally, the traditional Reunion
Weekend will still be held in May for alums who are
celebrating the years between their tenth and ﬁftieth
reunions.

Although very successful, the alumni ofﬁce cannot
complete all of these successful events without the
help of W&L students.

Kathekon is a group of approximately 50 W&L
juniors and seniors who are afﬁliated with the alumni
ofﬁce. These students also implement the SPEAK
tradition at the annual barbecue for ﬁrst-years. In the
alumni ofﬁce, they are educated on special events
and on becoming well-connected alumni so that
upon their graduation, they become active in the 90
W&L alumni chapters across the country and in the
United Kingdom.

Senior Julie Sanders said Kathekon is a way to
connect with alums.

“I hope to stay connected with the school after
I leave, and [Kathekon] is a fun group of people to
work with and a way to connect to the professors,”
she said.

During the F ive-Star General festival, Kathekon
members served as greeters to the visiting alums,
making them feel comfortable. Sanders said it makes
it easier for the alums to know there is a speciﬁc group
of students they can talk to.

Additionally, the Kathekon members played a
large role in the transportation of the alums around
campus on golf carts, ensuring that they get to and
from each planned activity and that they see the parts
of campus they want to see.

Kathekon member junior Emmy Mathews said she
loved her role during the festival.

“It was great to meet a lot of alumni and get their
insight. It’s surprising how similar their student ex-
perience at W&L is to ours,” she said.

Washington and Lee students will
soon face a slew of changes in re-
gard to winter registration and class
times.

As students may have noticed
while planning their winter term
schedules, the registrar no longer
lists letters for the times of class. The
actual time spans are listed instead,
due to the fact that some class times
have been altered. '

In addition, students will regis-
ter for two classes during the ﬁrst
week of registration, and register
for another two the following week.
The changes were proposed by the
Registration‘ and Class Scheduling
Committee and approved by the Uni-
versity Registrar and the Faculty Ex-
ecutive Committee.

Classes are now listed by actual
times because certain classes will
now only be scheduled for 85-minute
blocks. The class time changes stem
from the need to use the available
space effectively. Many Tuesday/
Thursday classes which are currently
scheduled for two,hours only actu-
ally take an hour and half.

University Registrar Scott Dit-
man explained that the change to 85-
minute classes is necessary because
in the current system, “We’re basi-
cally wasting that half hour.”

With the new system, ﬁve classes

can take place in the middle of the
day on Tuesdays and Thursdays in-
stead of four. Also, due to the cur-
rent construction on the Colonnade,
there are fewer classrooms available
for use, so shorter blocks allows for
more classes to take place in the
available space.

The decision to change the meth-
od of registration from all at once
to two at a time came about due to
the positive results from last year’s
freshman and sophomore spring
term registration. Unlike juniors and
seniors, freshmen and sophomores
chose one class they wanted to take
in the spring of 2009 and then chose
a second the following week.

Although the change will obvi-
ously increase freshmen and sopho-
mores’ chances of getting in to class-
es they need, Ditman says that some
juniors and seniors were also miss-
ing out on upper level classes they
needed, especially in the business
department.

Some upperclassmen are not par-
ticularly -happy about the changes.
The class of 2010 has had to deal
with being the last class subject to
general education requirements, and
is now facing changes to spring term
and their last winter term on cam-
pus.

“I’m annoyed that the class of

Changes include new time blocks and diﬂerent registration procedures

2010 is not enjoying privileges that
past senior classes have had,” senior
Andrew Sackman said. '

Ditman said he understands that
the large number of changes may be
overwhelming and that it is totally
coincidental that they are all happen-
ing at the same time.

“People’s tolerance for change is
beginning to reach a limit,” he said.

Still, he does not see any major
problems coming from the changes.
Not only does he point out that the
“culture of negotiation,” such a get-
ting into a class with the professor’s
permission even ifthe class is ﬁlll, is
a tried and true tradition at.W&L, but
he also thinks more changes could
come.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if there is
even more negotiating,” he said.

While students focus on pre-reg-
istering for winter term, they must
also keep in mind that that spring
term pre-registration is right around
the corner.

Students will pre-register for
their top 3 spring term choices after
Thanksgiving break and actually reg-
ister some time early in winter term.

Ditman cautions students to pay
close attention to the time require-
ments of new spring term classes,
because classroom time may not
be fully reﬂective of the amount of

  

time actually required for the course.
Faculty members may post syllabi
to give students an idea of what the
classes will demand.

Along with the changes made to
the class times and dates, students
will see different methods of choos-
ing courses. There is the new two-
and-two method, and there is what-
ever practice the Registrar decides
will work best for new Spring Term.

However, in regards to the future
of W&L class registration, Ditman
does not anticpate chanigng back to
the former method.

“The changes that we’re imple-
menting this year are probably going
to stick,” he said.

Students concerned about how

the changes might affect their aca- ‘

demic career should be pleased to
hear that the Ditman is making him-
self more accessible. He was in the
Marketplace Wednesday afternoon,
answering quick questions from stu-
dents and advising them on any short
concerns that might have.

He plans to continue this practice
in the future, especially during preg-
istration and registration periods.
Students should be on the lookout
for similar opportunites to brieﬂy
discuss how the changes to registra-
tion might affect them.

Death of a newspaper  

1968 alum Alex Jones speaks on the future of journalism

By Jessica Strait
STAFF WRITER

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist
and 1968 W&L graduate Alex Jones
discussed the future of newspapers
last Wednesday in a program that
was part of the Five-Star Alumni
Festival. -

Jones’ biggest concern in the
decline of newspapers is a parallel
decline in the hard-hitting news, or
what he refers to as the “iron core,”
that is vital to our successful self-
governing as a people.

The problem is that newspapers
do roughly 85 percent of this re-
porting, but these same newspapers
are shrinking in size at an alarming
rate—The New York Times plans to
cut 100 jobs by the end of the year.
Throw the digital revolution and cur-
rent economic climate into the mix,
and newspapers are in hot water.

Released earlier this year, Jones’
book, “Losing the News: the Future
of the News That Feed Democracy,”
is aimed at an audience concerned
with the effects of the changing news
industry and curious about what can
be done to save it.

Jones said he fears that‘ without
newspapers, traditional journalism
values essential to democracy are in
jeopardy.

“We’re moving toward valuing
voice, point of view and subjectiv-
ity over genuine objectivity,” said

Jones.

Jones said most news today relies
on entertainment, and in the digital
world, people value speed over ac-
curacy to the point of addiction. In-
depth reporting is now undervalued,
and although he sees the importance
of convergence media, Jones thinks
it may just be a phase. He stressed
to students that the most important
thing to do in classes is learn how
to write and to be wary of becoming
a jack-of-all-trades and a master of

‘ I10I'1C.

Jones, a self-proclaimed “tra-
ditional news guy,” does not think
newspapers will disappear anytime
soon, because many people like‘ him
are willing to pay to have their paper
on their porch to read how they want
it, when they want it.

In Jones’ case, that means with
his cup of coffee ﬁrst thing in the
morning. Although Jones said he un-
derstands that news must enter the
digital age, his main concern with
the transition is ﬁnding a way to de-
liver the news so it has an impact and
does not get lost in the “maelstrom of
what’s online.” J

This “bloody time for news” is
not only affecting big papers like The
New York Times; community jour-
nalism is struggling aswell. And it
hits close to home—The Greeneville

Sun, Jones’ family newspaper, just
experienced layoffs for the ﬁrst time
in its history. According to Jones, 10-
cal papers are becoming more like
local television in that they do not
write about anything that might drive
readers away. Instead, papers choose
to avoid politics and instead focus on
weather, features, sports and other
light topics.

As a result, newspapers that once
claimed social responsibility to pro-
vide information to citizens are now
faltering in their commitment. At
the same time, a disconnect exists
in readers—they may say they want
someone to be a watchdog at the
statehouse, but the same people will
not read long investigative articles
on the subject. Nevertheless, to en-
sure a counterweight to power, Jones
said we need strong, accountable re-
porters to tell it like it is.

“Newspapers are giving people
what they want as opposed to what
they might need,” said Jones.

Despite the downward spiral of
newspapers, Jones is hopeful that
news and select newspapers will
survive. He said that The New York
Times has made a market-driven
decision to remain strictly a news
source, and he believes the paper
will stay the course. Jones said he
bets on the quality of the paper, trusts

in a democracy

that devoted readers will offer sup-
port and hopes the Times will serve
as a model for other papers.

Jones comes from a strong jour-
nalism background—his family has
owned The Greeneville Sun, based
in Greeneville, TN, for four genera-
tions. But when he came to W&L in
1964, he was in “full rebellion ﬂight
mode” from this family tradition and
instead majored in history. But last
week when he came back to W&L,
a place he “reveres,” Jones simply
could not stay away from the pull of
journalism.

Jones said he was thrilled to be

Bright lights, small city: Lexvegas

Lexington ranked as one of the “coolest” small towns, locals ecstatic about the recognition

By Jessica Strait
STA F F W R IT E R

Lexington’s small-town size
classiﬁcation is common knowl-
edge to its visitors and residents,
but most people are unaware that
Lexington was also recently cat-
egorized in a new way: cool. In a
CNN.com article released online
Oct. 19, Lexington was named
one of the “Top 10 Coolest Small
Towns in America.”

out, it can be easy to forget what
a ‘cool’ place it is. I think that

this article serves as a reminder .

to us all of what a special place
our town really is and how im-
portant tourism is to our local
economy.”

A1 Hockaday, co-owner of
the The Shenandoah Attic, said
he also sees the ranking as good

gift shops (if he says so himself)
as reasons why Lexington is a
wonderful place to visit and an
excellent place to live.

But the biggest contributing
cool factor of Lexington, Hocka-
day said, is “the people; abso-
lutely, positively, number one,
the people.”

Rick Beville, who works

“Lexington has a pulse to it that a lot of small towns don ’t, and a lot

of that is due to the colleges... The town isn ’t stale and dead, and it

hasn ’t lost its orignal ﬂavor. ”
RICK BEVILLE, worker at Cocoa Mllls Chocolatlers

The article, based on rankings
by Budget Travel magazine, said
locals often describe Lexington,
population 6,867, as “right out of
a Norman Rockwell painting.” It
names Hull’s Drive-In Theatre,
George and Bob, Pumpkinseeds
and The Red Hen as favorite lo-
cal attractions and quotes resi-
dents who adore Lexington for
its history, sense of community
and safety-net atmosphere.

The Lexington Tourism Of-
ﬁce said it is is “ecstatic” about
Lexington’s newly bestowed
title, and that visitation to their
website has already risen dra-
matically since Lexington made
the list.

“We receive inquiries on a
daily basis as a result of this ar-
ticle,” said a representative from
the tourism ofﬁce. “When you
live in Lexington day in and day

news for Lexington and hopes
that it will bring more business
to the town and his gift shop.

“I think it could very well
have an impact,” he said. “If you
lived close to one of the top 10
coolest small towns, wouldn’t
you want to visit?”

Lexington, which has also
been named a “top place to live”
and a “top place to retire” by oth-
er publications in the past, tops
residents’ own personal lists for
varying reasons.

Hockaday has lived in Lex-
ington on and off since 1974,
when he moved here to help start
the Naval ROTC program at
VMI. The town opened its arms
to him back then, so when he and
his wife were deciding on where
to retire, the choice was easy. He
cites the superb hotels, wonder-
ful restaurants and tremendous

at Cocoa Mills Chocolatlers,
agrees.

“Lexington has a pulse to it
that a lot of small towns don’t,
and a lot of that is due to the col-
leges,” said Beville. “There are
also a lot of musicians, artists,
and creative people. That creates
a good feeling. The town isn’t
stale and dead, and it hasn’t‘lost
its original ﬂavor.”

Beville, originally from Rich-
mond, moved here eight years
ago and prefers the small-town
life to the big city. As a cyclist,
the geography of the area was a
key determining factor in why
he choose Lexington, and like
many students and residents, he
takes advantage of the “beautiful
hikes” and mountain views.

Wade Bell, a biology pro-
fessor at VMI, said he sees the
ranking as a tourism-boosting

ploy but acknowledges that tour-
ists are great for the town and
“help our bottom line.” Bell also
said most of the town’s coolness
stems from college students at
W&L and VMI.

“College students make any
town a neat place to be,” said
Bell. “They give youth and ener-
gy to older people who otherwise
might only have work.”

Whether or not Lexington’s
ranking will result in a‘ surge of
W&L applications has yet to be
seen, but Dave Leonard, Dean of
First Year Students, said he has
high hopes for the article’s im-

pact.

“Such positive press can only
aid in the cultivation of greater
prospective interest,” said Dean
Leonard. “I suspect the positive
proﬁling of lovely Lexington
may resonate even more deeply
for their parents in terms of vaca-
tion and travel.”

Dean Leonard has lived in
Lexington for seven years. He
said Lexington is cool because
“it’s a great location in which to
live, learn and for those of us a
little older, to raise a family.”

According to’ the online ar-
ticle, the criteria for a cool small

town is one that’s gotten every-
thing right—“great coffee, food
with character, shop owners with
a purpose”—and residents of
Lexington appear to be prouder
than ever of their charming, his-
toric town and its new title.

“I think it makes the entire
town and all of its people spe-
cial,” said Hockaday.

Other small towns that made
the list are Cayucos, Calif.,
Breaux Bridge, La., Tubac, Ariz.,
Wallace, Idaho, Saugerties, N.Y.,
Mount Vernon, Iowa, Jackson-
ville, Ore., Rockland, Maine and
Whiteﬁsh, Mont.

Opinions

A comprehensive guide to surviving Parents Weekend

Stockton Bullitt gives advice on impressing the visiting parents and hiding the bad stuﬂ this weekend

By Stockton Bullltt
OPINIONS EDITOR

The dreaded Parents Week-
end is ﬁnally here, not coinciden-
tally on Halloween, the scariest
holiday. For all of you blissfully
ignorant ﬁrst-years who are ex-
cited to see your parents after
two months away, be prepared
for quite a weekend.

To brag, I am one of the
school’s foremost experts on
Parents Weekend. I have sur-
vived ﬁve since high school
started, and I even earned recog-
nition as a child prodigy when I
hit kindergarten’s Grandparents’
Day out of the park. What can I
say? Some people are born to do
math. Others are born to survive
Parents Weekend.

The real problem with Par-
ents Weekend is that it is basi-
cally 72 hours of time that your
parents get to ﬁnd out everything
bad about your life. Further-
more, Parent’s Weekend gives
parents 72 hours to make sure
that you are earning every bit of
the tuition they are paying. Trust
me, you do not want this. If your
parents had their way, you would
be doing your Advanced Physics
during a rousing game of chess.
Oh, and all of this would be done
sober.

Fortunately, you have an ex-
pert to help you out.

The ﬁrst thing you need to
learn about Parents Weekend is
that surviving Parents Weekend
is built on the same foundation
that makes families thrive in
general: lots and lots of lying.
Really, you can’t have enough of
it. And that is what this weekend
has to be all about. You need to

paint a picture for your parents.
In that picture, you are not only
a respectable student, but also a
clean, polite, respectful, estab—'
lished member of society. If you
are anything like me, painting
this picture takes a Blagojevich
level of lying. From Friday until
Sunday, you should be primar-
ily concerned with deceiving
your parents into loving you that
much more.

Let’s start with the bedroom.
Now, obviously you want to
clean your room before your par-
ents come. Everyone knows that.
But there are some details of
which you need to be aware be-
fore you let your parents in. First
of all, you should clean your
room a day or two before your
parents come, not much sooner.
If you clean it up too soon, there
may be a couple of stray shirts or
pants that drunkenly end up on
the ﬂoor.

This is the weekend when
you ﬁnally break the plastic off
those textbooks that you bought
in early September. You should
probably throw them around the
room a little bit or color on them
for a little while so they look suf-
ﬁciently used. Make sure you
place them neatly--not too neatly,
your parents don’t want to enter
a museum--on your desk.

Also, stop by the library and
pick up a book by a famous in-
tellectual to put beside your bed.
If you are out of ideas, go with
Proust, Hemingway or Dickens.
My mom always falls for Dick-
ens. Go to somewhere between
pages 100 and 200 in the book

and make an ear mark. That way,
when your parents ask you what
the book is about you can accu-
rately respond, “Well, I’m in the
middle, but I still don’t really get
it.” If you make your fake inden-
tation too far along in the book,
you’ll probably have to explain
the plot, and unless you antici-

ever going to happen, especially
if your teacher has yet to get the
chocolates you sent her. You al-
ready ordered the chocolates,
right? Amateur.

Anyway, there is only one
right way to portray yourself to
your parents with regards to aca-
demics. They should leave this

The real problem with

Parents Weekend is

that it is basically 72 hours of time that your

parents get to ﬁnd out everything bad about

your life.

pated and read the Wikipedia ar-
ticle on it, you might be in a bit
of trouble.

Now, obviously you don’t
want any kinds of alcohol or
drug paraphernalia in your room,
but why stop there? You need to
convince your parents. Get some
Juicy Juice gallons and some of
W&L’s wonderful safe drinking
posters to decorate your room.
It’s a safe bet.

For the school aspect, you’re
probably thinking that it would
be best to try and portray your-
self as the most intelligent stu-
dent in the school. False. This is
why you’re not the expert.

The problem with that meth-
od is that your parents are going
to expect a 4.0 on every report
card and gleaming reviews from
every teacher. It’s not like that

weekend thinking that you are
the dumbest student in the school
but the hardest worker. Parents,
like any other adults, adore peo-
ple with no brains and a great
work ethic. That way, when you
get an A, all of the adults can feel
like they played a role in you get-
ting that grade. Aren’t old people
adorable?

There are a couple of ways
to convince your parents of your
apparent stupidity and diligence.
The highlighted books in your
room will help but don’t stop
there. You need a multi-pronged
front to overcome your parents’
assumptions. Pay some people in
your grade to purposefully pass
by you and your parents in the
quad and mention the scheduled
study group that you apparently
set up.

Deeds gets dirty but still will not win

With Virginia is gubernatorial election coming up, Abel Delgado
chastises Democrat Creigh Deeds ’dirty campaigning

By Abel Delgado
c o LU M N I s T

Next week will mark the end
of the Virginia govemor’s race
and, one would hope, an end to
statewide mudslinging. But if
this rather dirty election cam-
paign has taught us anything, it
is that the type of mud that gets
thrown around matters.

Republican Bob McDonnell’s
mud has been substantive. He
has labeled his Democratic ad-
versary, Creigh Deeds, a “tax and
spend liberal” because Deeds has
actually proposed to raise taxes.
Deeds would argue McDonnell
is obsessed with this fact, but at
least McDonnell is arguing about
something in his opponent’s plat-
form.

Besides that, the McDonnell
campaign has been primarily
about Bob McDonnell and what
he wants to do for Virginia.

Deeds’ mud has been signiﬁ-
cantly less substantive and sig-
niﬁcantly messier. He has tried
to cast McDonnell as some sort
of arch-conservative sexist, bas-
ing most of his "claims—and prac-
tically his entire campaign—on a
graduate thesis McDonnell wrote
twenty years ago. Can you imag-
ine being judged in 2029 for a
paper you are working on now?
I make arguments in papers I do
not personally agree with all the
time.

This is not to say there are
worrisome aspects of the the-
sis that McDonnell might have
agreed with at one time, but if
the best argument you can come
up for as to why you should be
elected concerns something your
opponent wrote twenty years ago,
you might have a problem.

The Deeds campaign’s heavy
focus on McDonnell’s graduate

thesis is to everyone’s detriment.
This is not just the sentiment of
party-line Republicans. Promi-
nent Democrats have begged
Deeds to portray a more positive
message for over a month.

The election campaign can be
summed up in three stages. First,
the candidates debated‘ on the
issues and Deeds trailed in the
polls badly.

Next, Deeds refocused his
campaign to an onslaught of per-
sonal attacks on McDonnell’s
views, which helped him close
the gap signiﬁcantly.

Still, he could not manage to
overtake McDonnell in the polls.

Finally, the public has recog-
nized the dirty Deeds strategy
and McDonnell now has a com-
fortable lead. The lead is so com-
fortable, in fact, that Republicans
are hoping Deeds brings down
the rest of the Virginian Demo-
cratic ticket.

It wasn’t supposed to be this
way. Virginia has turned blue
the past few election cycles, and
it should, have continued on its
blue swing. McDonnell is the
old-school conservative type that
is supposed to be a fossil in the
Obama Era, not a front-runner.

Deeds, the more moderate
and less tarnished candidate of
the Democratic Primary, was
supposed to run a unifying cam-
paign. However, negativity threw
unity out the window.

The Deeds message hasn’t
just been negative. It’s been a
farce. McDonnell’s oldest daugh-
ter served as an Army ofﬁcer and
his other daughters earned mas-
ter’s degrees. Does this sound
like someone who wants to keep
women as homemakers?

The Deeds campaign had the
audacity to run an ad claiming
McDonnell was against funding
for mammograms.

This rightfully infuriated can-
cer survivors who support Mc-
Donnell.

As Stephanie Hamlett said, “It
offends me as a woman, it offends
me as a breast cancer survivor,
and it offends me as a Virginian.

I know Creigh badly wants to be
governor, but does he really want

to try to win like this?”

Currently, all signs point to
Deeds losing. Hopefully, this will
serve as a warning to politicians
that if you try to win at any cost,
you are even more vulnerable to

losing.

Leadership

Tuesdays With Leadership:

Explore the concept of adaptive leadership, in which
leaders surface conﬂict, challenge beliefs and seek new
ways of doing things without incurring too much personal
risk and remaining anchored to principles.

On The Line

Schedule a meeting with the
teacher in your token class where
you do work hard. Your grade in
the class doesn’t matter whatso-

ever, as long as the teacher thinks .

you work hard. That way, your
parents will be convinced that
you are a hard worker and will
blame the teacher for calling you
an idiot, and you will look like

' the good guy.

Next, give your parents the
tour of your favorite classrooms
and lecture halls on campus. Re-
member to show them the carrel
in the library you never used un-
til you planted folders and bind-
ers there, and remember to show
your parents the writing center
where you never go. Just make
sure you show them at a time
when there is nobody in the writ-
ing center.

You also need to emphasize
the extracurricular group you
belong to, whether it is factual
or ﬁctitious. There’s no South
American Appreciation Club on
campus? There is now.

There‘ are also some unused
club sports at W&L that your par-
ents could easily be duped into
believing in. Imagine, you could
be the captain of your very own
croquet, badminton, or cricket
team! Just hire some ﬁiends to
be your teammates and a home-
less guy to be your coach. And
the reason you are not playing
this week is because “UVA can-
celed at the last minute. That’s
the problem with playing [insert
club sport here] in the state of
Virginia.”

The dinner is probably the

easiest thing to take care of. All
you need to do is book one of
the expensive restaurants in Lex-
ington (in other words, anything
above Hardee’s), and make a sad
glance at your empty wallet once
the check comes. Pity is the best
way to get free stuff. Oh, and re-
member to read the Wall Street
Journal before going to dinner.
That way you can pretend to
have some idea about mergers
and acquisitions and have your
parents actually approve of you
for once.

The last thing you need to
worry about is the late-night par-
ties. Remember, you never have
more than three beers in a night
because of a DARE commercial
you saw on alcohol poisoning.
They don’t need to know about
Windfall later that night. Also,
ﬁrst—years, you are rushing the
particular fraternity or soror-
ity because of the value they
place on GPA and’ philanthropy
events.

So, now you have a pretty
good guide to get through this
weekend. If you follow my ad-
vice, I can’t guarantee an obnox-
iously nice Christmas present,
but since grades won’t be report-
ed until the presents are already
bought, kissing some major ass
this Parents Weekend can get
you far in life.

Other colleges don’t, but you guys have it good

When other universities are having a tough time making ends meet, W&L students should appreciate what they have

By Jordan Rothman
COPY EDITOR

Right now, countless uni-
versities across the country are
experiencing trouble due to the
ongoing ﬁnancial crisis. This is
especially a problem for endow-
ment-dependent institutions,
which have seen their invest-
ments diminish without being
able to ﬁll their budgetary gaps
with the open purses of donors.

Coming from a university
that is experiencing particularly
intense problems due to the ﬁ-
nancial downturn, I know ﬁrst-
hand the trouble that this crisis
has created in higher education.
Yet it seems that this campus has
not been as greatly affected by
the downturn as other institutions
and we should all be thankful for
the luxuries we enjoy at W&L.

All told, I thought I would
write my article this week about
how awesome we have it here at
Washington and Lee despite the

economic downturn. Other col-'

leges are not so lucky and we
should be really happy we are so
privileged.

I graduated this May from
Brandeis University, a Jew-
ish-sponsored college located
in Waltham, Mass. There are
many reasons why Brandeis is

 

experiencing the full impact of
the economic crisis. Since the
university is only 61 years old,
Brandeis cannot rely on donors
due to the fact that its alumni
base is both young and small in
comparison to peer institutions.
Furthermore, this situation has
led the university to rely heavily
on its endowment, but because of

All of these conditions dras-
tically affected how the school
operated this past year. Several
stations in the dining hall closed
and meal options were cut in
order to slash operating costs.
Furthermore, our golf and swim
teams were suspended and nec-
essary repairs on the university’s
swimming pool have been halted

All told, countless schools across the nation

are cutting programs and staff in order to

deal with the damagingieconomic crises.

 

the ﬁnancial crisis, the dividends
derived from these investments
have decreased markedly.

Since Brandeis is Jewish-
sponsored, it has historically re-
lied on the ﬁnancial support of

-the American Jewish community.

Because of the Madoff scandal,
many Jewish philanthropists ﬁnd
themselves without expendable
money and this has further hurt
the institution’s ability to fund-
raise.

indeﬁnitely. Operating hours at
the library, gym and dining fa-
cilities have been shortened and
programming money for various
activities were capped.

Almost all holiday parties last
Christmas were cancelled and, in
order to save money, the univer-
sity even tried to take away paper
towels from bathrooms that have
electric hand dryers. Further-
more, Brandeis has decided to
increase its enrollment consid-

erably in order to receive more
tuition money and will begin
requiring students to spend a se-
mester away from the university
in order to facilitate this growth.

The changes don’t stop there.
The Bernstein scholarships,
funds designed to bring excep-

4 tional musicians to campus, have

been suspended indeﬁnitely. Ad-
ditionally, the number of PhD.
students at the university has
been reduced because of the cost
associated with having these
scholars in residence.

Also, contributions to retire-
ment funds have been halted,
new hiring has ceased and other
measures have been taken to nar-
row the impending budget gap
that the university now faces.
Perhaps the most drastic and
most widely advertised endeavor
to reach ﬁnancial solvency was
attempted when the university
tried to close down its campus
art museum and sell the artwork
valued at roughly $400 million.
After experiencing huge national
pressure and even lawsuits from
various donors, this action was
not taken. Nevertheless, attempt-
ing to take this monumental step
indicates the desperate ﬁnancial

condition in which Brandeis cur-
rently ﬁnds itself.

The economic crisis has af-
fected not only my beloved alma
mater, but schools across the
country. The University of Cali-
fornia is now in the process of
implementing tuition increases,
lay-offs and furloughs in or-
der to work themselves “into
the black.” Mount Holyoke has
stopped serving hot breakfasts
in order to save money. LSU,
Dartmouth and countless other
schools are all laying off staff
workers in order to balance their
smaller budgets and reach ﬁnan-
cial solvency.

Countless schools across the
nation are cutting programs and
staff in order to deal with the
damaging economic crises.

Now, I have not been at this
university long enough to notice
any appreciable differences in
how the institution has been op-
erating since the ﬁnancial slow-
down.

What I can see is that relative
to other schools, we have it pretty
good here at W&L. For instance,
there is still money to keep the
lawns green and well-manicured,
a luxury that has been sacriﬁced

totheetilnr

With no consent,

rape is rape

Some see gray areas, but Karcher thinks this
attitude prompts rape victims to blame themselves

Washington and Lee is
known for its “work hard, play
hard culture.” Students dedi-
cate time to their classroom
studies, knowing that when
their work is done there will
be plenty of parties to choose
from on any given Wednesday,
Friday or Saturday. Of course,
party at W&L is synonymous
with alcohol—and lots of it.

The prevalence of alcohol
at parties means that alcohol is

sires very clear and told him
she did not want their hookup
to proceed to sex. Her date
agreed, and they kept going.
Not long after, he pushed her
down, climbed on top of her
and started to have sex with
her. Alicia said “no” again and
told him to stop, but he ignored
her and eventually she gave up
and let him ﬁnish.

Afterwards, Alicia felt like
she had been raped—she had
not given consent and had told

ups taking place between stu-
dents. Alcohol fuels many of
these hookups and leads to a
lot of ambiguous situations in
the process.

Devotees of Cosmopolitan
may have read a recent article
where in which writer Laura
Sessions Stepp outlines the so-
called growing trend of “gray
rape” among young men and
women. She told numerous
stories of hookups after late
night parties, and I immedi-
ately thought of W&L.

There was just one prob-
lem: the situations and read-
ers’ stories Stepp shared all
sounded like full-ﬂedged, un-
deniable rape to me.

She describes sorority girl
“Alicia,” who, after her for-
mal, wandered back to her
date’s room where they started
to make out. She made her de-

him “no” and “stop” out loud
more than once.

She wasn’t sure, however,
whether other people would
perceive it as “real” rape, es-
pecially since she had been
drinking and agreed to go back
to his room in the ﬁrst place.
In her eyes, it fell into a gray
area, because she thought she
should have done more to stop
the rape from happening.

Stepp deﬁnes “gray rape”
as something between consent
and denial, something not eas-
ily deﬁned.

For me, rape is undeni-
ably black and white. Under
Virginia law, if any person
has sex with another person
against that person’s will using
“force, threat or intimidation,”

. or if the person is “mentally

incapacitated or
helpless,” it is rape.

physically

What many W&L students
don’t realize is that “mentally
incapacitated” includes drunk
and blackout. Heavy drinking
at W&L is a huge part of the
reason why our sexual assault
and rape rates are twice the
national average. And, unfor-
tunately, these ideas of “gray
rape” and using alcohol as an
excuse are why our numbers
of rape and assaults that are
actually reported are so abys-
mally low.

Relying on this idea of gray
rape is likely to lead a lot of
actual rape survivors, like
Alicia, to blame themselves
and say, “if only I had less to
drink” or “if only I didn’t go
back with him to his room,”
rather than acknowledge that
they did not give consent to
sex and their partner had sex
with them anyway.

This happens far too often
on our campus, and the idea of
gray rape, especially involv-
ing alcohol, is used to excuse
away countless rape and sexu-
al assault situations.

Other crimes never seem to
be as murky. When someone
murders a person or steals a
car while intoxicated, being
drunk is never an excuse. I’ve
certainly never heard the term
gray murder or gray robbery.
Why is sexual assault any dif-
ferent?

END IT.

by many other institutions. In ad-
dition, there is free food at many
campus events such as movies
in the Stackhouse theatre, and
all the facilities seem well-kept.
All told, this institution is enjoy-
ing the luxuries forgone by many
other universities and we should
truly be thankful for this situa-
tion.

I am not saying that things
haven’t changed at all here as a
result of the ﬁnancial crisis, nor
that this school has not made sac-
riﬁces due to budget shortfalls.
What I am saying is that, from
my experience, we have it pretty
good here at W&L.

Overall, I just thought I would
illuminate this fact and describe
the problems experienced by
other universities around the
country. By noting this, I hope
that we can all better cherish the
luxuries and comforts we enjoy
here at W&L.

What happened to “Hello?”

W&L is cherished speaking tradition is sadly dying

Hi, there! Haven’t seen you in a
while, but I’ve got to run to class.
It’s in Wilson, so I’ve got a hike
ahead of me. See you around.

Now, that wasn’t so hard, was
it? I can’t help but feel that the
Speaking Tradition here at W&L
is dying. Until recently, I’ve been
responded to amicably by most ev-
ery student and professor I’ve said
hello to on campus, and that’s over
the course of over three full years.
Just a simple “How’s it goin’?” or
a maybe a “Hey, Strock” (or what-
ever your name happened to be)
was all that it took, and I’d get a
similar response, if not a deeper
conversation. Either was ﬁne with
me.

A few weeks ago, though, I was
stricken with a cold so bad that it
made it nearly impossible for me

to talk. Nevermind the difﬁculty »

it presented in keeping up in—class
participation grades. I wasn’t
able to say hello to people. But I
had a solution: I’d wave, smile
and mouth a greeting in response
to people. This solution didn’t

work, thoughmit never even had a
chance. I discovered that, with the
exception of people that I knew
fairly well, people wouldn’t speak
to me. I would walk to classes,
meals in the dining hall and to my
room in Gaines without h.earing a
simple hello. I wouldn’t even get a
wave or a nod. Nothing.

Now, this was no scientiﬁc ex-
periment—nor an experiment at
all. But when I got my voice back,
I asked a few of my friends if they
had noticed this, and they had.
They said it’s been like this for a
while. One friend—a fellow senior
—remarked that she had recently
said hello to someone who, instead
of being cordial in any way, just
stared at her like she was some
sort of mutant. This shouldn’t be
happening.

In his 1995 Inaugural Address,
University President John Elrod re-
marked on the speaking tradition:
“It is a simple act but one whose
meaning and value we should not
underestimate. A greeting can be
a phony gesture concealing indif-

ference or disdain, but it can also
express genuineness, warmth, con-
cern, delight. Our daily greetings
should reﬂect the commitment that
we will not be strangers to each
other; that we will know and care
for each other as friends and not as
strangers.”

It’s simple: it’s the same respect
and civility that pervade the honor
system that drive the speakipg tra-
dition. It’s nice to not be strangers
with everyone else in class. I un-
derstand that a lot of students here
go to parties to meet people—~it
makes sense. But there’s no reason
why you can’t meet someone for
the ﬁrst time when you’re wait-
ing in the halls of the C-School or
in line at the Co-op. For a school
whose student body puts so much
emphasis on having social connec-
tions, it seems ironic that so many
of us won’t even say hello.

The generation that cares

Abel Delgado takes a proper look at our generation

Dear Editor,

I realize the underlying silli-
ness of a columnist writing a letter

to the editor in regards to a piece I

his own opinions editor wrote, but
I believe Stockton Bullitt has once
again written an op-ed worth a re-
sponse. With all due respect, Mr.
Bullitt’s argument has so many
holes in it, I am have trouble de-
ciding which one to drive through
ﬁrst. I ﬁgure the headline is as a
good a place as any.

My ﬁrst reaction to being la-
beled part of the “we just don’t
care” generation was the prover-
bial “what the —?“. First problem
is with the “we.” Not only does
it attempt to stereotype an entire
generation but, Mr. Bullitt also
manages to completely misrepre-
sent what a generation constitutes.

A generation is not people
born within a four year period, my
friend. Our generation does end

‘ around 1992 but it also begins in

the late 70s. “Generation ADDer-
all,” as he refers to us, already has
two ﬁtting names, “Generation Y
“and “The September 11th Gen-
eration,” since the last members

of our generation were still old
enough to understand what was
happening on that day in 2001. It’s
also highly doubtful that the brunt
of mass media marketing would be
geared toward a group of people
who born just four years apart. I’m
pretty sure every advertising ex-
ecutive still cares about the 18-40
age group regardless of what exact
year people were born.

But the most disturbing aspect
of Bullit’s article is the prepos-
terous idea that our generation
doesn’-t care about things. If any-
thing, our generation cares about
actual important matters and there-
fore doesn’t sweat the small stuff
mentioned in his article.

If anything, it is the generations
before us that didn’t care. They
voted in low numbers. They bor-
rowed money against our future.
They also did their best to com-
pletely mess up the environment.
We will carry the burden of their
mistakes, but many of the solutions
for those mistakes have come, and
will continue to come, from our
generation. C

We are also a generation that has
bravely fought two wars. Whether

you’re like me and believe they
are wars of liberation, or like oth-
ers and believe they were wars
of choice, you should recognize
that mostly older men in Wash-
ington sent mostly younger men
and women into harrn’s way. The
men and women of our generation
who serve have done so with great
courage and care and just because
we don’t see them around campus.
that doesn’t mean they don’t rep-
resent our generation as much as

/we do.

Our generation faces greater
challenges than any generation
since the Great Generation that
grew up during the Great Depres-
sion and fought World War II. With
ballooning debt, climate change
and inept politicians on both sides
that claim to be~but really aren’t—
part of our generation, we have a
lot of messes to clean up.

If Mr. Bullitt were to look
around campus, he would see we
already started the cleanup process.
Obviously, we really do care.

 Unique play pushes the envelope  

Edgy play directed by senior Marquita Robinson brings lesbians, sex to W&L to Keller Theatre stage

By Anthony Ballor
STAFF WRITER

Lesbians, pot and incest, oh
my!

This year’s Floumoy Play-
wright Festival features “Where
We’re Born,” a play by Lucy
Thurber that focuses on life in a
small, working-class town where
“family relationships are main-
tained by a delicate balance be-
tween desire and dependency.”

Thurber is an acclaimed au-
thor whose plays have been
workshopped and staged by
several nationally acclaimed
companies, including the Man-
hattan Theatre Club, William-
stown, Rattlestick’s Playwrights
Theater and the Atlantic Theater
Company.

In “Where We’re Born,” Lilly
(played by senior Jenna Wor-
sham) returns from college to her
small, rural hometown in Mas-
sachusetts, where her cousin,
Tony (senior Brian Devine), his
girlfriend Franky (senior Melissa
Szumlic) and their friends Vin
(junior Dave Curran) and Drew
(junior Johnny Coyle) await her.

Lilly’s life before college was
decidedly fractured: due to an
unpleasant relationship with her
mother, she depended on Tony
to shelter her from other stu-
dents who made fun of her intel-
ligence.

Her homecoming is com-
pletely alienating and nontradi-

tional. Senior Marquita Robin-
son is directing the play for her
theater thesis.

“Lilly’s journey is a struggle
to reconcile two worlds,” Robin-
son said. “While her classmates
are probably greeted at home
with cookies and homemade
sweaters, Lilly comes home to a
can of beer and a cigarette.”

Lilly’s return causes chaos
in the lives of her cousin Tony
and his girlfriend Franky, whose
relationship is made tense by
Tony’s repeated philandering and
Franky’s feelings of abandon-
ment. Lilly falls into the middle
of this situation.

Fueled by both alcohol and

marijuana, Lilly .and Franky
sleep together and then begin a
loving but secretive lesbian rela-
tionship. When Tony discovers
the truth and violently confronts
Lilly, they too give in to their
passion for each other, creating
a love triangle which culminates
in the destruction of both of the
relationships.

“Where We’re Born” is an
unconventional, unsettling play,
and the natural question to ask
would be why such a production
was chosen and if the theater de-
partment expect students to at-
tend it. "

“When you take a look at why
theater exists in our society in

the ﬁrst place... it gives us per-
mission to look into the lives of
others. . .Audiences want to leave
the theater changed and enlight-
ened,” Robinson said.

“To say that a play like
‘Where We’re Born’ is not rel-
evant to W&L students is to say
that the struggles of human life
are not relevant to us,” she said.

While most students at W&L
may not have a personal connec-
tion to the world in the play, it
may be for this reason why we
should attend the performance:
to help us to understand the lives
of others. Consider attending
such a well-written, moving play
to be part of your cultural educa-

tion.

“Where We’re Born” is part
of the Floumoy Playwright
Festival, which includes perfor-
mances of this work Nov. 5-7 at
7:30 p.m. in the Keller Theatre as
well as a special reading of Lucy
Thurber’s play “Scarcity,” di-
rected by Rob Mish, which will
take place on Nov. 7 at 3 p.m. in
the Johnson Theatre.

There will be talkbacks fol-
lowing each performance of
“Where We’re Born,” featuring
Thurber and several other mod-
erators, including 2009 graduate
Melissa Caron and Professors
Mayock, Ristau and Radulescu.

Bonding with parents: beer pong  

Annual tournament inspires quality father-son time through the time-honored medium of competitive teamwork

By Findley Merrltt
STAFF WRITER

The age-old image of fa-
thers coaching their sons to play
America’s favorite pastime takes
on a whole new meaning during
Parents Weekend.

There is no better example of
this phenomenon than Pi Kappa
Alpha’s annual father-son beer
pong tournament. And it’s an
excuse for parents to relive their
college days.

The tournament has been a
standing tradition for four or ﬁve
years, said senior Pika member

Adam Cancryn.

More speciﬁcally, it’s been
around as long as fraternity
members have resided in 108
East Henry Street.

Every Parents Weekend, par-
ents rush out to the house known
as “Velva” on Friday to either
brush up on their skills or play
for the ﬁrst time.

“It lasts until they ﬁnd a win-
ner or the cops come,” Cancryn
said.

The event is surprisingly or-

ganized given the nature of the
tournament.

The night before, the frater-
nity creates a list of all the mem-
bers, parents and freshmen who
want to play.

That information is organized
into brackets and assigned to
three different pong tables.

The winner is announced af-
ter playing through the quarterﬁ-
nals and the ﬁnals.

Cancryn stressed that the
tournament is completely open

to everyone, not just fraternity
members or fathers.

There is even a free table for
those who come late or happen
to wander inside.

The real novelty of the tour-
nament is watching parents
transform into their 20-year-old
selves.

“It’s really surreal,” said Can-
cryn.

He was surprised when his
father had complete accuracy as
he played for the ﬁrst time in his

life.

“You see a different side of
parents,” Cancryn said.

This is especially true when
it comes to, winning the touma-
ment.

Fathers get competitive hop-
ing to claim bragging rights at
the tables.

Fame and glory comes in
the form of a plaque in Velva’ s
kitchen. «

Mr. Bunn, father of Pika
members Stevenson and Nelson,

is the reigning champion.

According to Cancryn, Bunn
has won for the past two years
and probably hopes to win
again.

Bunn’s title will be put to the
test once again this Friday at 8
p.m.

Generals face tough Week, seniorday loss

The men ’s soccer team dropped a 3-] loss to Eastern Mennonite on -Wednesday before falling 1-0 to Hampden Sydney on Saturday

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

When you commit to play on a var-
sity college team for four years, there
is one game you always hope you win:
senior day. But that ﬁnal home victory
is something the three seniors on the
Washington and Lee men’s soccer team
will just have to live without.

_ The Generals fell, 1-0, to Hampden
Sydney on senior day this Saturday. The
Generals’ defense was able to hold off
the Tigers until the 34th minute, but
Hampden Sydney needed only one goal
to close out the victory.

The Tigers outshot the Generals 13-
11 and controlled the momentum for the
majority of the game. W&L goalkeeper
sophomore Alex Lambert played all

A 90:00 minutes and recorded four saves

against the one goal.

tain Drew Crowley. “But we played a
great game and kept ﬁghting.”

The men’s soccer team has had a
rough couple of weeks. Coming off a
1-0 loss to Roanoke over Homecoming
weekend, the Generals rebounded with
a much-needed 2-0 win over Emory
and Henry. Junior midﬁelder Ben Belair
contributed an unassisted goal and soph-
omore midﬁelder James Paldino scored
off an assist from Crowley. Junior goal-
keeper Ben Bartlett played all 90:00 for
the Generals and earned one save in the
shutout.

The Generals came close to another
win facing off against Ferrum Oct. 18,
but couldn’t close out the victory, end-
ing the game in a 0-0 tie. They then
dropped a 3-1 loss to Eastern Menno-
nite last Wednesday. The Generals’ sole

goal in the loss came from Crowley off
an assist by ﬁrst-year midﬁelder Collier
Wiseman.

Two losses, one tie and the lone win
over Emory and Henry have dropped
the Generals to 4-6-4 overall and 2-5-
2 in conference play. But the Generals
remain optimistic as they head into tour-
nament play.

“It’s been really frustrating because
all season long we have proven that we
can play with any team in our confer-
ence,” Bartlett said. “We just haven’t
been able to get the results. No matter
how tough the loss, we’ve kept our head
up and kept ﬁghting. Right now we are
focused on making the playoffs because
we know we can do some damage.”

Women’s soccer continues to shine with defens'we dominance

The Lady Generals have recorded 12 total shutouts on the season and only one loss as they look ahead to the ODAC tournament

By Adam cancryn
s TA F F w R IT E R

Finding the back of the net is often
the result of good timing and offensive
skill. But against the Generals this year,
scoring a goal is more like a stroke of
luck.

Anchored by its back line, the W&L
women’s soccer team, which is 13-1-2
and 8-0-2 in the ODAC, has turned its
matches into a study of frustration and
futility. They have allowed goals to just
three opponents this season, with last
week’s victories over Emory & Henry
and Ferrum giving the 21st-ranked Gen-
erals 12 total shutouts.

The key to such defensive dominance
begins in the middle. Senior midﬁelder
Maggie Sutherland and sophomore cen-
ter back Corinne Smith direct the action,
locking down their opponent’s best strik-
er while keeping W&L’s bevy of skilled
defenders synchronized. They are com-
plemented by a rotation of at least seven
different backs and defensive midﬁeld-
ers, a luxury of interchangeability that
coach Neil Cunningham has utilized to
keep his players fresh and focused.

The result is something similar to
watching Forrest Gump play ping-pong:
attack after attack is calmly yet abruptly
turned away, the back line working with
a ﬂuidity of motion that belies its ma-
chinelike efﬁciency, until the opponent
tires of the fruitless back-and-forth, giv-
ing the Generals a swift counter-attack
opportunity before dropping back into
their defensive shell.

It is a system that has come to rely
more on solid fundamentals and risk
management than sheer talent. Each
player recognizes their role in a strat-
egy that forces opposing forwards into
double teams and takes away the middle
of the pitch, eliminating high percentage
shots.

Cunningham’s tactics and the team’s
execution have produced the Generals’
best defensive season since 2006, when
the Generals gave up just three goals
en route to ﬁnishing atop the ODAC.
Through 16 games this year, opponents
have taken 103 shot attempts, an average
of just 6.4 per game. Of those attempts,

only 42 were put on goal. By compari-
son, W&L has more than tripled those
statistics, averaging 21.2 shot attempts
per game while putting 160 of their 339
shots on goal. J

Stout defense has also provided
time for the offense to gel. On track
to score less than 50 goals for the ﬁrst
time since 2001, W&L lacks the go-to
scorer they’ve relied on so heavily in
the past. But a lack of consistency has
been remedied through quantity. First-
years Ainsley Daigle, Katie Howard and
Hannah Sackﬁeld have stepped in ably
and bolstered the Generals’ speedy of-
fensive corps. As of press time, 11 dif-
ferent players had scored at least twice,
a consequence of an opportunistic style
of play that turns turnovers into high-
percentage counter-attacks.

However, even the most efﬁcient ma-
chines can break down. And in one of
the country’s deepest conferences, one
slip-up can unravel a season’s worth
of work. Despite outshooting Guilford
33-4 and leading for most’ of Saturday’s

match, a 71st-minute equalizer forced
W&L to settle for a 1-1 tie. The draw,
coupled with Virginia Wesleyan’s win at
Hollins, dropped the Generals one point
out of ﬁrst place in the ODAC as of Oct.
26.

Virginia Wesleyan has now won 10
straight games since losing to W&L on
Sept. 19, giving them a conference-lead-
ing 27 points on the season.

With the ODAC Tournament set to
kick off this Saturday, the Generals have
likely lost out on a No. 1 seed. But based
on past history, seeding means little once
the games begin.

Though W&L’s defense brings to

mind that of the ’06 team, that’s where —

the players hope the similarities stop.
Despite going undefeated in conference
play that year, the Generals’ ODAC
championship hopes ﬂamed out in the
semiﬁnals with a 1-0 loss to Virginia
Wesleyan.

This time, tournament success de-
pends on the steady play of the expe-
rienced back line. Having allowed all

seven goals this year in the second half,
it will fall to Smith and Sutherland to

keep the defense focused throughout the ,

entire match.

Given time to ﬁnd its footing, W&L’s
offense can create chances around the
net, where the team has made the most
of its opportunities. Despite the drop in
total goals scored, the Generals are still
capitalizing on their chances, ﬁnding the
net nearly once out of every two shots
on goal.

As long as W&L does not have to rely
on the offense to play catch-up, the team
has a good chance to break its ODAC
championship drought. They dealt Vir-
ginia Wesleyan their only conference
loss, stymied Lynchburg’s dangerous
scorers and have not lost to Bridgewa—
ter in nine years. The Generals might
not have the ﬁrepower of years past, but
if the defense comes out focused, they
won’t need it.

Last minute drive gives Generals a 28-21 win over Guilford

Football improves to 3-5, 2-2 ODAC with a 28-21 victory over Guilford last Saturday

By Ted Moore

' STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee secured a 28-21
ODAC victory over Guilford last Satur-
day after sophomore quarterback Char-
lie Westfal ran for a 21-yard touchdown
late in the fourth quarter.

The Generals led the Quakers, who
are 1-6, 0-3 ODAC, with the halftime
score at 14-0. This was following a pair
of scores from sophomores Harrison
Hudson on an 18-yard pass from Westfal
and Johnathan Clemo on a two-yard run.
However, mistakes in the second half let
Guilford back in the game. The Quakers
capitalized on three Generals turnovers,
scoring 21 points in the second half.

“Offensively and especially person-

ally, we made too many major mistakes,
turning the ball over and giving the oth-
er team a short ﬁeld,” Westfal said. “The
defense played really well, though.”

Westfal was intercepted on the Gen-
erals’ ﬁrst play of the third quarter. A
two-yard touchdown run from Quakers’
quarterback Billy Watkins capped the
ensuing drive.

A Generals’ fumble gave the Quakers
the ball just 33 yards from the end zone
at the beginning of the fourth quarter. A
27-yard touchdown run from Quakers’
running back Mike Williams tied the
score at 14-14. ,

The Generals responded on the en-

suing kickoff with a 99-yard return for
a touchdown by sophomore linebacker
John Kavanagh.

“The kick was back to the goal line
and I saw some [green in front of me,”
said Kavanagh. “I made one or two peo-
ple miss, but other than that it was just
a great blocking scheme with everyone

, staying on their blocks.”

The Quakers tied the score at 21-21
with 6:26 remaining in the game, as
Quaker’s linebacker David LaPlaca re-
turned a General’s fumble 42 yards for
a touchdown.

Despite the frustration of three sec-
ond-half turnovers leading directly to

Quaker scores, a composed Westfal
led the Generals down the ﬁeld on the
game’s decisive drive. The Generals
compiled an eight-play, 70-yard drive
that resulted in Westfal’s 21-yard run
and put the Generals up by seven with
3:39 remaining. '

“The ﬁnal drive was us really com-
ing together and putting together a nice
string of plays,” said Wesfal.

In addition to his game-winning
touchdown on the ground, Westfal ﬁn-
ished the day with 95 yards through the
air, completing nine passes in 15 at-
tempts. Clemo and Hudson had 83 and
84 yards rushing, respectively, as the

“Playoffs? Don’t talk about playoffs.”

Columnist Drew Koeneman discusses the excessively long post—seasons in the NBA and NFL

By Drew Koeneman
c o L U M N IS T

As tried-and-true mass market teams
the New York Yankees and the Philadel-
phia Phillies prepare to face off in the
106th World Series, one might wonder
the basic question: who cares?

The answer: over 20 million people,
which has been the average TV audi-
ence per game of the fall baseball classic
since the year 2000. The World Series
will beat this fall’s series premieres of
Sunday Night Football (18.2 million)
and Grey’s Anatomy (17.1 million), two
of the nation’s most watched shows

And all of this depends on one word:
playoffs.

The postseason of any major sport
team is undoubtedly the most exciting
time of the season. After all the hard
work and early morning practices, and
all the screaming and bratwurst grill-
ing by the fans, the whole season comes
down to one game, one moment, one
play-—or in some cases, two months.

The 2009 NBA playoffs, which lasted
from April 18 to June 14, and the NHL’s
Stanley Cup Playoffs, which lasted from"
April 16 to June 12, were the two most
unnecessarily long months of the sports
year. In both the NBA and NHL, where

30 teams compete over a long season,
16 teams earn the right to compete in
the playoffs. Not only does this make
each regular season game less and less
meaningful, but it takes away excite-
ment from the playoffs. In the NBA and
NHL playoff systems, teams compete in
four rounds, each consisting of a best-
of-seven series. This creates the possi-
bility for a single team to play 28 games
in the playoffs. With so many games,
the playoff atmosphere is often dull and
drawn-out. Teams try to salvage some
excitement in the championship series,
but unfortunately usually fail.

There is a reason why the Super
Bowl is the most-watched sporting
event in America, with 98.7 million
Viewers huddled around TVs last win-
ter to watch Santonio Holmes squander
any hope for the Arizona Cardinals’ ﬁrst
Super Bowl victory. That is because
the NFL playoffs are set up in a way to
make it exciting.

The NFL playoffs, the most-watched
playoffs in America, are the ideal sys-
tem. Throughout the season, the 32
teams of the NFL battle day after day
on the gridiron for the highly coveted 12

playoff spots. I would not have wanted
to be the one to tell Bill Belichick that
his Patriots were not good enough to
make the 2008-2009 playoffs with a ll-
5 record.

With only one game per round, the
four rounds of the NFL playoffs seem
to ﬂy by, lasting only a mere 29 days in
2009. Not only does that carry the open-
ing round excitement all the way to the
grand ﬁnale of the Super Bowl, but the
proclivity for upsets to happen through-
out the playoffs adds the excitement that
is lacking in the opening rounds of the
NBA and NHL.

No one wants to watch bad teams get
creamed by NBA all-stars. But in the
NBA, higher-ranked teams often embar-
rass inferior opponents who probably
shouldn’t have gotten in to the playoffs
in the ﬁrst place. There are rarely good

. matchups in the opening rounds. In the

ﬁrst round of the 2009 NBA playoffs,
which were watched only by an aver-
age of 2.9 million people per game,
only two out of the eight series went to
seven games. In the case of four out of
the eight series, the higher-ranked team
won 4-1 or 4-0. In the NHL, where sadly

only 0.4 million people tuned in each

A ﬁrst round game, it was a similar story.

Where is the excitement? You need to
remember that people like underdogs. In
the ﬁrst round of this year’s NFL play-
offs, which were watched by an average
of 29.8 million people per game, not one
team with the better record won.

Now let’s not forget about America’s
pastime, baseball, whose playoff system
falls a close second behind the NFL’s.
Major Leagie Baseball playoffs, which
are the second most watched of any ma-
jor US sport, usually only last within
the month of October. This short time is
just enough to allow the excitement to
build throughout the month. The MLB
has done it right; with only eight teams
making the playoffs, everyone is good,
and anyone can win. And that is what
people want to watch.

The ﬁrst round of the MLB playoffs
are only a best-of-ﬁve series, which not
only speeds up the playoffs, but also adds
to the unpredictable nature of the series.
Looking back a couple weeks, not too
many people would have thought that
the St. Louis Cardinals and Boston Red
Sox would be heading to the golf course

running game continues to be a focus
for the Generals’ attack.

The Generals’ defense was led by se-
nior linebacker Gus Cavanaugh and se-
nior safety Donovon Sawyer, who each
recorded nine tackles. Junior comerback
David Stemlicht contributed eight tack-
les in addition to two pass-breakups and
a forced fumble.

The Quakers ﬁnished with 338 yards
of total offense, passing for 209 yards
and rushing for 129.

W&L will next host the Bridgewa-
ter Eagles (5-2, 2-1 ODAC) Saturday at
1:00 in the General’s last home game of
the season.

after getting swept in three games.

Compare that to the NBA, where no
teams in the bottom half of the 16 have
ever advanced past the second round
of the playoffs since the playoff format
moved to 16 teams in 1984.

Where is the incentive to watch when
you know what is going to happen? This
is why only 13.4 million fans are sticking
around to watch the NBA ﬁnals: there is
no excitement at the start of the playoffs
and by the time NBA ﬁnals have ﬁnally
rolled around, the two months of wait-
ing has hurt interest.

Unfortunately, the annoyingly long
and uneventful playoff systems of the
NBA and NHL will not change due to
media contracts and having to pay the
ridiculously high player salaries. We
will all just have to accept the fact that
this is the way it is. Let me know when
the fourth quarter of game seven of the
NBA ﬁnals is on; maybe I’ll watch.

Volleyball on 12-game Winning streak after Weekend Victories

The Generals defeated Bridgewater, 3-1, and Marietta, 3-1, to improve to I 7-

By Llzz Dye
smrr wmnzn

The Washington and Lee volleyball
team extended its winning streak to 12
with a 3-1 victory over Bridgewater and
a 3-1 victory over Marietta on Saturday.
The wins brought the Generals to a 17-
10 overall record and a 7-2 conference
record.

The winning streak ﬁrst started with
the Generals 3-2 defeat of Lynchburg.
Since then W&L has dropped only ﬁve
games, earning a 33-5 advantage over
their opponents.

“We struggled earlier this year with
some ODAC teams, but have really hit
our stride and are playing quality vol-
leybal1,” said sophomore hitter Megan
Daily. “We have gotten some help from
some teams losing and now are in a po-
sition to control our destiny. If we win
out, we can ﬁnish second and have a
great seed going into the tournament.”

The Generals took their streak into
full force when they notched two shut-
outs in 3-0 victories over Sweet Briar
and Guilford.

Against Sweet Briar, junior middle
blocker Louise Brooks led the oﬁ°ense
with seven kills, followed by senior out-
side hitter Rachael Phillips with six kills
and six digs. First-year libero Cameron
Hill also contributed 12 digs and three
service aces to the victory.

Two days later against Guilford,
Brooks and Phillips again led the charge
for the Generals. Phillips posted in the
double-digits with 12 kills while Brooks
added 8 kills.

A 3-2 win over Christopher Newport
was sweet revenge for the Generals,
who lost to them earlier in the season,
3-0. Brooks led the offense with 20 kills,
followed by Phillips with 16 kills. Daily
also added 11 kills.

Senior setter Kristi Stevens regis-
tered 50 assists in the game and tied for
a team high with 13 digs.

“The Christopher Newport game
was a big match,” Daily said. “They
are always a good team and every year
is competitive. We lost a rough one last
year and one earlier in the year, but we
didn’t focus on past losses. We stuck
with our philosophy and game plan, and
were able to beat a good team.”

The Generals next faced Roanoke
,and again came out victorious with a
3-0 sweep. This was the second time in
eight days that W&L defeated the Ma-
roons. Philips showed a strong offensive
front again with 13 kills while hitting
.433. Brooks added 9 kills and hit .500
for the match. Stevens led the team with
28 assists and 14 digs, while Hill added
an impressive 11 digs and a pair of ser-
vice aces.

The Generals continued to dominate
as they took on Mary Baldwin. Hill led
W&L with 20 digs, complemented by
13 digs from Stevens. Junior Marah
Schmitz drove the offensive with 11
kills and junior Summer Goldberg add-
ed an impressive four service aces along
with four digs.

With 10 straight wins behind them,
the Generals were conﬁdent and poised
heading in to their weekend match-ups
against Bridgewater and Marietta.

Taking down ODAC foe Bridge-
water, the tandem duo of Philips and
Brooks was at it again. Philips led with
16 kills while Brooks put up 12.

Daily and ﬁrst-year right-side Bailey

Walker added eight kills apiece. Hill led
the Generals with 15 digs, while Phillips
and defensive specialist Jenna Finger
contributed 12 digs each.

In their second match of the day
against Marietta, the Generals showed
no signs of slowing down. Brooks and
Philips again led the way with. double-
digit stats. Philips posted 19 kills and
Brooks added 11 to give the "two 30 total
kills for the game.

Philips and Brooks had a combined
58 kills for the weekend. Senior setter
Megan Steinhardt added 48 assists to
the offensive effort.

With the Generals’ recent success,
Head Coach Brian Snyder has every
reason to be smiling.

“All of those matches were big
for us to continue to play well and im-
prove, which has been our goal in each
match this season,” Snyder said. “[The
win over Christopher Newport] was
big since we had lost to them earlier in
the year, so that gives us a lot of posi-
tive reinforcement that the time we have
spent in the gym trying to get better has
played off”

Snyder already has his sights on
ODAC tournament play and believes
that his team has a chance to make a real
run in the tournament.

“In general, we need to have great
effort on defense, make smart decisions
on offense, and serve and pass the ball
well,” he said. “If we do those things on
a consistent basis, I think we can beat
any of the teams that we might face the
rest of the season.”

But Snyder is cautious not to look
too far ahead.

“As for the ODAC tournament, I
think we just need to keep working to
get better every day until we get there,”
he said. “We have improved a great deal
this year, but we still have two weeks
and ﬁve regular season matches to play
before we get there, so we are just going
to focus on using those opportunities to
improve as individuals and as a team.
Once we know who our opponents will
be in the tournament, we will begin to
prepare for them.”

Men’s basketball ready to improve

Don’t expect them to break out into
song and dance during practice, but the
Washington and Lee men’s basketball
team has their head in the game.

Last year, the Generals overcame a
mid-season slump and ﬁve-game los-
ing streak to make a run to the ODAC
Championship game and post a 16-13
record, marking the ﬁrst time in 20 years
the Generals have earned back-to-back
winning seasons. As the team prepares
for their season opener, they aren’t wast-
ing any time getting back into a winning
mindset.

“We had a great year last year,” said
junior guard Jason Cimino. “We had six
seniors who really didn’t want to lose
and made a run for the championship in
the ODAC tournament... We learned a
lot. A lot about focus, and that every day
means something. You can’t ever take

days off You can’t relax at all.”

As head coach Adam Hutchinson
begins his seventh season at W&L and
seeks to build on his 55 career wins, all
he asks for is the very best his team can
give.

“We’ve got to understand it’s got to
be every guy, every game, 100 percent
focused,” Hutchinson said. “I think one
of the lessons we learned last year was
that you can’t be 96 percent in today and
expect to do well. It’s got to be 100 per-
cent.” .

That’s the kind of work ethic that got
the Generals to the ODAC Champion-
ship last year, and the players are look-
ing to keep the tradition of hard work and
preparation alive. The team graduated
six seniors last year, but a new batch of
upperclassmen leaders and freshman up-
starts is eager and ready to ﬁll the void.

“The loss of one person is an oppor-
tunity for somebody else,” Hutchinson
said. “Those guys graduated, so it opens
up playing time for every guy who’s
looking for an opportunity to prove
themselves.”

The Generals will return co-captains
senior forwards Ben Goetsch and Zach
White, the third and fourth leading scor-
ers respectively for the Generals last
year.

“I’m trying to take a big leadership
role,” White said. “We’re a young team
and we need everyone to step up and
show the way. We’re trying to build
more leaders for the next year and the
year after that.”

Hutchinson also cited the leadership
qualities of Cimino.

“[He] has begun showing leadership
in terms of executing, knowing what he ’s

said. “It’s very encouraging.”

Other returners for the Generals are
sophomores Jonathan Guest, Will Smith
and Kyle Bond.. Returning players will
also receive support from a talented
ﬁrst-year class looking-to make a serious
impact in their ﬁrst season at W&L.

“[The ﬁrst-years] are good,” Cimino
said. “We only have six returners so
they’re going to play a huge role. And I
think they’re ready. They’re very talent-
ed and they’re very deep, very athletic.
They’re working hard; they’re learning
everything. We’re expecting a lot out of
them.” ' _

Field hockey dominates competition in five straight shutouts

The Generals haven ’t dropped a point since falling 6-0 to Eastern Mennonite on October 7

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

The ﬁeld hockey team is on a roll.
W&L has posted a ﬁve-game winning
streak and pushed its overall record to
9-6 and 5-2 in conference play. The
General’s recent wins haven’t just been
victories, they’ve been dominations.

Over the past two weeks, the Gener-
als have beaten Roanoke, Rhodes, Se-
wanee, and Virginia Wesleyan by scores
of 7-0, 1-0, 3-0, and 6-0 respectively.
Add the game prior to Roanoke, a 5-0
win over Bridgewater, and the Generals
have a ﬁve game shutout streak going.
Date back even further to the Eastern
Mennonite game and the Generals have
not allowed a goal in a little over 360
minutes.

Facing off against Roanoke Col-
lege on their home ﬁeld, senior forward
and W&L career goal leader Sallie
Armstrong opened the scoring for the
Generals off an assist from sophomore

forward Christina Benedetti fewer than

three minutes into the game.

Junior defender Kelly Tran and se-
nior forward Steph Mansey closed out
the half with two unassisted goals to give
W&L a 3-0 lead going into the break.
Roanoke could do nothing but watch as

the Generals sealed the deal with four

more goals from Armstrong, sophomore
defender Susie Giampalmo, and two
from ﬁrst-year forward Katherine Price.
When the dust settled, the Generals had
scored seven goals and ﬁred 34 shots on
the Roanoke cage. Roanoke posted no
goal; no shots even made it through to
senior goalkeeper Caroline Habliston.
“It’s almost more nerve-wracking to
play in a game where there’s not a lot of

. action in the defensive circle,” Hablis-

ton said. “Getting caught daydreaming
becomes a prime opportunity for the
other team to score a fast-break goal.
My mindset is to treat every minute of
the game like the score is 0-0.”

The Generals’ next scheduled game
against St. Mary’s was rained out so the
team had to wait until next Sunday to
resume action.

Rhodes made the trip to face W&L
and gave the Generals a run for their
money. Seventy minutes of regulation
play was not enough to decide a win-
ner, so the game was sent into overtime
with the two teams deadlocked at 0-0.
A little over two minutes into overtime,
Armstrong scored the winner unassist-
ed, sending the Generals and their fans
into a frenzy. As evidenced by the score,
both teams played stiﬂing defense, with
W&L getting 12 shots on the cage and
Rhodes making only four.

The team looked to continue their hot
streak when they hosted Sewanee last
Tuesday. The Generals again blanked

' the opposition, garnering a 3-0 win.

Armstrong bookended the scoring for
the Generals, with Price also tallying a

goal.

Armstrong has seemingly put this
team on her back as the Generals rocket
towards postseason play. She has scored
eight goals in only six games.

“My teammates have just set me up
with some good shots, and I am able to
ﬁnish the play,” Armstrong said.

On Saturday, W&L made the long
trip to Virginia Beach to face Virginia
Wesleyan. Proving that they are just as
formidable on the road as they are at
home, the Generals wiped the ﬂoor with
VWC, winning 6-0. '

With yet another commanding tri-
umph, the team set a school record for
consecutive shutout victories. The scor-
ing in this one can be summed up as
the Armstrong, Benedetti and Mansey
show. Armstrong notched two goals and
an assist. Benedetti added a goal and an
assist and Mansey led the scoring with
three goals. She scored her third 58 min-

utes into the game to record the hat trick.
With such strong offense, the Generals’
defense was able to lock it down and

post yet another donut in the opponent’s,'

scoring column.
All recent signs point to success in
upcoming playoff action.

“Our passing and defense have im-
proved and with the way we have played
recently, we are really excited to start
postseason play,” Armstrong said.

W&L starts ODAC conference tour-
nament play this Saturday with the op-
ponent to be determined. With the way
Coach Orrison’s club is playing right
now a rematch against Lynchburg or
Eastern Mennonite looks to be inevita-
ble if the Generals want to win it all.

The Washington and Lee pool is sud-
denly getting a lot more use. The men’s
and Women’s swim teams are back in sea-
son, kicking off their winter campaign with
meets against Mary Washington and Cen-
tre and the Women’s ODAC Fall Relays.

The teams traveled to Mary Washing-
ton for their ﬁrst meet of the year. Opti-
mism was high, but both teams fell behind
and gave the meet to Mary Washington.
The men lost by a score of 146-116 and the
women fell behind 180-82. But the Gener-
als did take home victories in six events.
Senior Nick Talluri won the 100 freestyle
with a time of 48.70, while fellow senior
Winston Stagg ﬁnished ﬁrst in the 200
breaststroke with a time of 2: 19.69. Soph-
omore Chris Washnock took ﬁrst place 200
backstroke at 1:57.09 and sophomore Jeff
Stirling claimed the 100 butterﬂy in 53.29.
First-year Rick Sykes saw his ﬁrst win
with the top place in the 50 freestyle with
a time of22. 14.

On the Women’s side, the 400 freestyle

‘relay team of seniors Sarah Simpson and

Jenna Worsham, sophomore Elizabeth
Stames and ﬁrst-year Izzy Brassﬁeld took
ﬁrst place with a time of 3:34.76. First-
year Brittany Ross also added points for
the Generals with a second place ﬁnish in
the 200m butterﬂy (2: 14.35).

It was a quick turn around for the Gen-
erals as they went right back into the pool
the next day to face off against Centre. The
men earned their ﬁrst victory of the season,
defeating Centre 134-109.

On the men’s side, the Generals took
ﬁrst place in nine events. Talluri, Wash-
nock, and senior Ian Childers led the
Generals with two individual event titles
apiece. Childers won the 100 breaststroke
(1204.32) and 200 breaststroke (2221.56).
Talluri claimed the 50 freestyle (22.08) and
the 100 freestyle (49.01). Washnock placed

ﬁrst in both the 100 backstroke (56.04) and.

200 backstroke (2100.44). Sophomore Ben
Absher won the 1000 freestyle (10:41.04),
Stagg won the 200 butterﬂy (2:02.83), and
junior Brandon Wilder took the 200 free-
style (1251.68). The relay team of ﬁrst year
Wayde Marsh, sophomore Brian Stirling,
Stagg and Talluri took the 200 medley re-
lay (1:40.48).

But it was a split ticket day for W&L
swimming and the women dropped their
second meet, falling 142-120. Four ﬁrst
place victories in individual events and a
winning relay team, however, helped offset
the loss. Ross took ﬁrst in the 200 butter-
ﬂy with a time of 2:18. 19. Stames won the
500 freestyle with a time of 5:40.43 and
fellow sophomore Katie Salvati touched
ﬁrst in the 200 backstroke with a time of
2:17.48. Worsham took the 200 IM with
a time of 2:20.10 and anchored the win-
ning 200 freestyle relay team that ﬁnished

with a time of 1:43.67. She was joined by
Simpson, sophomore Dana Fredericks and
Brassﬁeld.

The women7s team rebounded quickly
in the ODAC Fall Relays this past Satur-
day, claiming six of 10 events and posting a

score of 362 en route to victory. Fredericks
and Brassﬁeld were major contributors to
the team win. The two racked up the most
points for the Generals, each swimming
for four winning relay teams. Simpson,
Worsham and ﬁrst-year Megan Bock each
had a part in three winning teams. Fred-
ericks, Simpson, Brassﬁeld and Worsham
claimed the 200 freestyle relay with a time
of 1:43.09. Fredericks, Worsham and Bock
ﬁnished ﬁrst in the 300 3x100 IM relay
with a time of 3:16.84. Fredericks, Book
and senior Lynn Bazzel teamed up to win
the 150 yard breaststroke relay in 1:37.86.
Simpson, Brassﬁeld and Stames won the
400 freestyle relay at 3:49.08. Fredericks
and Brassﬁeld teamed up with Ross and
sophomore Brielle to take ﬁrst place in the
200 medley relay in 1:58.13. Brassﬁeld,
Bock, Simpson, Stames and Weinstein
combined with juniors Becky Guynn and
Rachel Mensch and sophomore Jocelyn
Cassada to take the 200 8x25 Relay with a
time of 1:42.47.

Looking ahead to the rest of the season,
both teams have high expectations of good

things to come.

In the 2009 pre-season polls, the wom-
en’s team was picked to win its third-con-
secutive conference title. Back for the
Generals are seven First Team All-ODAC
swimmers from last year including the

2008 Rookie of the Year, sophomore Eliza-
beth Stames.

“We will'have a young team this sea-
son, but we will not be short on talent,”
said Head.Women’s Coach Kami Gardner.

The men’s roster is loaded with depth
and experience and Head Coach Joel Shi-
noﬁeld will be looking for his team to
make big strides in the ODAC.

“We have a deep and all-around strong
team,” Shinoﬁeld said. “The team this year
is well-balanced and will be highly com-
petitive in all events.”

The men’s team will rely heavily on the
leadership of its eight seniors, particularly
All-America recipients Talluri and Bran-
don Bamds and First-Team All-Bluegrass
Mountain Conference honorees Dan Aus-
tin and Jonathan Giesen. Washnock, who
was recognized as the W&L Outstanding
First-Year Male Athlete last year, will look
to capitalize on his ﬁrst-year success with
a strong sophomore effort.

Both teams return to action this Satur-
day with a meet against Transylvania.

Collegiate team horse system a challenge

F irst-year rider Collier McLeod talks about the aajustment to college riding

By Becky Mlckel

‘STAFF WRITER

lt’s every child’s dream to have her
own pony, but Collier McLeod, a ﬁrst-
year member of the Washington and Lee
University riding team, has been living
that dream for 13 years.

“I always knew that I wanted to ride,
but my parents said I had to wait until ﬁrst
grade,” said McLeod, who began compet-
ing in second grade and got her own horse
in ﬁfth grade.

McLeod became a regular on the riding
circuit, practicing everyday for competi-
tions that took place anywhere from her
home state of Georgia to Canada. In 2008,
McLeod was named junior Amateur of the
Year among Canadian and American rid-
ers for best overall performance, earning
scholarship money among other prizes.
With so much practice time and so much
success, McLeod was familiar, with her
own horses. But at W&L, the riders don’t
get to keep the same horse all the time.

“I’1l ride a certain horse at practice
one day, but everyone takes turns, so it’s
weeks before I actually ride that horse
again,” explained McLeod. ‘

McLeod said she found the concept of
team horses challenging, but fun. And it’s

something she’ll have to get used to as a
rider at W&L as regional competitions op- '
erate under this system as well. The uni-
versity responsible for hosting a tourna-
ment must provide horses for every rider.’
Visiting teams don’t have to cart large
horse trailers across the country, but the
visitors are put in the challenging position
of depending on horses they have never
even seen before,

“Competitors draw a horse, get on, and
then walk around a brief circle before be-
ing judged,” McLeod said. “It’s deﬁnitely
different, and was slightly overwhelming
at ﬁrst because lots of us have never rid-
den in competitions like that before.”

The NCAA realizes the challenge of
unfamiliar horses and competitors are
judged solely on their personal perfor-
mance and not on their ability to connect
with the particular horse they are riding.

“The NCAA judges how correctly the
rider performs, which includes everything
from presentation to the course itself,”
McLeod said.

Despite the challenges of adjusting to
collegiate riding, McLeod is putting her
full effort into the W&L riding team.

‘‘I wasn’t looking for a college speciﬁ-
cally for the riding program, but it was in-
ﬂuential in my decision,” McLeod said.

At the Hollins Invitational on Oct. 18,
McLeod earned sixth place in Interme-
diate Equitation on the Flat, a category
speciﬁc to the NCAA. The Generals tied
for sixth place overall out of 10 compet-
ing schools and were led by six ﬁnishes in
the top three. Sophomore Tamara Morse
claimed third place in the Open Equitation
Over Fences and tied for third place W&L
senior captain Emily Coyle in the Open
Equitation on the Flat.

First-year Molly Rountree took third
place in the Intermediate Equitation Over
Fences and sophomore Catherine Skitsko
took third in the Novice Equitation Over
Fences. First-year Kerriann Laubach
rounded out the top ﬁnishers for the Gen-
erals, taking third place in the Beginner
Walk-Trot-Canter.

The riding team will next head to the I
Bridgewater Invitational on Saturday, Oc-
tober 31.

Blair on ethics

Former journalist who fabricated and plagiarized speaks at Ethics Institute,
takes the blame for choices and says his wrongdoings started with “baby steps ”

By Diandra Splcak
NEWS EDITOR

When the idea that former reporter
for the New York Times, Jayson Blair,
would speak at Washington and Lee’s
48th Journalism Ethics Institute cir-
culated the nation, many expressed
surprise and shock. One blogger went
as far as to suggest that employers
should not hire W&L journalism
graduates. Blair, accused of fabrica-
tion and plagiarism while working at
the NY Times, delivered his keynote
speech to a packed Stackhouse The-
ater Friday evening. In a red sweater
and khakis, he proposed that students
would learn more about ethics from
wrongdoing rather than focusing on
the best practice.

“One of the major problems with
the instruction of ethics is that the
focus is often more greatly on the
best practices when we can learn
the most from the worst practices,
which set ﬁrm boundaries and teach
us how good people end up doing bad
things,” 33-year-old Blair said. “If we
merely believe that only bad people
do bad things, then you good people
have no reason to learn ethics at all
for you are destined to do good, no
matter what happens.”

According to journalism ethics
professor Edward Wasserman, invit-
ing Blair to speak at the institute was
a departure from the former “heroic”
keynoters. In his introduction, Was-
serman explained why he thought
bringing Blair would help expand the
understanding of ethics on campus
and in the real world.

“I want to talk about this invitation
on two levels. First as a journalist
— I’m in the business of helping train

the next generation of journalists,” '

Wasserman said. “And as journalists
their solemn calling will be to engage
with and confront the people who
are at the center of the major events
of their time - not via e-mail, but up
close. Our speaker tonight is one such
person. That’s not to compliment him,
that’s to state a fact. So he’s exactly

smart, idealistic people to transgress,
to forgo fundamental principles, to
do things that are personally and
institutionally destructive.”

But despite his interest in Blair’s
personal journey, Wasserman stressed
that he was not interested in publicly
praising or denouncing Blair.

Wasserman provided background
on Blair’s story. Blair was a 27-

on how to avoid the rocky roads that
lead to ethical transgressions.”

Blair focused on the idea
that his ethical choices brought him
to his current place while bringing up
the accusations that have faced him in
the aftermath of his transgressions.

“I’m at peace with the knowledge
that there is no one or nothing to
blame for my troubles but myself,” he

“I ’m at peace with the knowledge thatthere is

no one or nothing to blame for my troubles but

myself I am here because of choices 1 made. ”

JAYSON BLAIR, former New York Times reporter

year-old reporter for the Times in
2003, when “it was disclosed in a
sensational front page story, that he
had, quote, ‘committed frequent acts
of journalistic fraud while covering
significant news events in recent
months. The widespread fabrication
and plagiarism represent a profound
betrayal of trust and a low point in the
152-year history of the newspaper.’”

Blair was accused of fabricating
comments, concocting scenes, plagia-
rizing information from other news-
papers and creating the impression
that he had “been somewhere or seen
someone when he had not.” Accord-
ing to an article in the Times, 36 of
73 of his articles over a seven-month
period “had substantial problems.”

Blair wrote a book about his
experiences in 2004 but since then,
he has rarely spoken publicly about
the event.

“When I was first approached
about speaking at Washington and
Lee, I was hesitant about reopening
an old wound of mine and of the
journalism profession,” Blair said.
“But I was convinced that there were
more lessons to be learned from my
experience. I believe it is my duty, de-
spite my new focus on psychological
coaching and mental health causes,
to do what I can to aid journalism
students by providing them guidance

said. “I’ve been accused of attempting
to deflect blame for fabrication and
plagiarism on the New York Times,
the profession of journalism, illness,
substances, race and an allotment of
other people, places and things. Those
accusations of blame are as big an
untruth as the lies I told. I am here
because of choices I made.”

According to Blair, ethical deci-
sions do not present themselves in
one big event, but rather happen over
a span of time.

“Rarely are our choices in life
presented as a major dramatic ques-
tion. If they were, it would be easy,”
he said. “Our most important choices
in life, including ethical ones, present
themselves in small baby steps, one
step at a time, in minor choices...
One day, you can turn around and
ﬁnd yourself close or across a line
that you never thought you’d go
anywhere near.” »

As a journalist, Blair had a clear
outlook as to why he got into the
profession.

“I entered the profession to help
people and then became convinced
that to help the most people, I had
to have the greatest impact on their
lives. And to have the greatest impact,
I needed to work at one of the best
newspapers,” he said. “Somewhere
along the way, on my way of climb-

 After the fa I I: Jayson    

ing upwards, I lost sight of the very
reason I entered journalism.”

He claimed that his goal of climb-
ing high at the Times and continually
pleasing his editors slowly led him
to the wrongs that he committed.
“No one came to my door and asked
whether I wanted to shoot journalism.
It was not so simple.”

His choices, he said, came about
through a number of “confounding
factors,” including a newsroom that
had a greater emphasis on speed and
impact and battle fatigue resulting
from the September llth attacks as
well as his own personal struggles
with mental illness and substance
abuse.

“But suffice to say, that my re-
covery from alcohol and drug abuse,
while life changing in a positive way,
was the harbinger leading the way

for the intensified presentation of t .

mental health symptoms that added
fuel to a ﬁre that was initially ignited
by my character ﬂaws, allowing it to
burn brighter and perhaps longer,”
Blair said.

Blair attended the University of '

Maryland, majored in journalism and
headed the student newspaper, the
Diamondback, as editor-in-chief dur-
ing the 1996 ~ 1997 academic year.
Blair interned with the Times in 1998,
and eventually took a full-time report-
ing position until his resignation after
his ethical setbacks. For the past two
years, he has taken a job as a certiﬁed
life coach at an agency. He specializes
in attention deﬁcit disorder (ADD),
pervasive developmental disorders,
mood disorders and substance abuse
disorders.

The W&L Journalism Ethics Insti-
tute is held twice a year and brings top
media professionals and academics to
campus. For two days, these profes-
sionals and academics hold seminars
with students from the University’s
capstone journalism ethics class.
The sessions deal with case studies
of ethical dilemmas presented by the
practicing journalists.

Two Washington and Lee pro-
fessors have recently published
new books, according to press
releases from the university.

Todd C. Peppers, law profes-
sor, and co-author Laura Ander-
son are the authors of “Anatomy
of an Execution.”

In this book they tell the story
of Chris Thomas, who was ex-
ecuted in Virginia in 2000 for
the crime of a double murder he
committed at age 17. He was 26
when he was put to death. Thomas
was one of the last in the United
States to be executed for a juve-
nile offense before the Supreme
Court ruled against the execution
of juveniles.

Anderson taught Thomas in
high school and witnessed his
execution after serving as his
spiritual advisor after the murders,
and Peppers became interested in

Thomas’s story when he heard
Anderson speak in a seminar
about the death penalty, according
to the press release.

The two decided to write about
Anderson’s personal experience

the tragedy and what could have
prevented it.

In exploring the death penalty,
“Anatomy of an Execution” looks
at various issues, from the fair-
ness of appellate review in such

and Thomas’s life while also ad-
dressing the death penalty. The
authors examined the trial and
the details of the murder, but they
also talked to family members
and friends to learn what led to

a dramatic case to the quality of
life for death row inmates.

Sister Helen Prejean, an oppo-
nent of the death penalty who was
written on the subject, applauds
the book for its illumination of

a tragedy.

“It wasn’t only the system
and the players in it that let down
Chris Thomas, the book also dem-
onstrates that again and again the
adults who might have prevented
the tragedy of the murders and the
execution leave this young boy
to grieve alone and ﬁnd his own
way in a world he doesn’t know or
understand,” she said, according
to the Web site for Northeastern
University Press.

“Anatomy of an Execution:
The Life and Death of Douglas
Christopher Thomas” is currently
available from Northeastern Uni-
versity Press.

Journalism professor Doug
Cumming’s new book looks at the
history of American journalists
and writers who started writing
in the South, suggesting that writ-
ing in the South developed from

unique motivations.

Called “The Southern Press:
Literary Legacies and the Chal-
lenge of Modernity,” his book
claims that journalists in the South
were motivated to ﬁnd an outlet
for literature rather than simply
serve the public with informa-
tion.

Cumming argues that the types
of communities in the South led to
this unique perspective of south-
ern writers. In the larger cities of
the North, in contrast, the growth
of industries and packed popula-
tions created the demand for the
expose and objective styles of
journalism.

Without these pressures, the
roots of writing in the South
were allowed to be more creative,

I Cumming claims. Journalists got

into the business so they could ex-
periment with the craft of writing.

“I think every Southern journalist
secretly wanted to write a novel
eventually,” Cumming said in the
press release.

Southern editors also took a
gentler approach to addressing
the hard issues such as the civil
rights movement.

Published in July, “The South-
ern Press” is available from
Northwestern University Press.
It is part of the “Visions of the
American Press” book series,
launched by the Medill journalism
school at Northwestern.

Why November is better than your favorite month

No Shave November is month-long exaltation of manliness is here. How are your whiskers celebrating?

By Jonathan Salm
COLU M N I st

November is the greatest
month of the year.

While some readers may
try to argue with this statement,
November’s inherent superiority
is in fact an objective truth — and
I am here to prove it.

Of course, November con-
sists of many great days, includ-
ing Thanksgiving, Veteran’s Day
and, uhhh, Thanksgiving, but
individual days cannot claim
responsibility for November’s
greatness. Each day lasts a pal-
try tvventy—four hours, whereas
the reason for November’s fame
is a month-long celebration of
manliness, masculinity and ma-
chismo.

That’s right, folks, I’m talk-
ing about beards.

Welcome to No Shave No-
vember 2009, a test of masculine
prowess and heroic will. Girls,
the elderly and the pre-pubescent

 

need not apply. For the rest of us,
however, the time is upon us to
put down the razor and let our
facial hair grow.

Maybe we’ll grow some dig-
nity, maybe some shame and
maybe all (or at least most) op-
portunity of getting laid. There’s
a reason the month is altema-
tively referred to as No Sex No-
vember.

But before you write off this
quest, grab the razor and head
for the sink, let’s consider fa-
mous bearded men and what
their beards did for them.

First, religious ﬁgures: Jesus,
Moses, Muhammad and the big
man himself — God. Not a bad
grouping, considering these guys
represent over half of the world’s
religious population.

Mythological ﬁgures: Odin,
Thor and Zeus. If you learn one
thing about either the Norse or

tolheetilior

Greek Gods, know that they nev-
er had problems with the ladies.

The world’s greatest think-
ers, artists and revolutionaries

Welcome to No Shave November 2009, a test

of masculine prowess and heroic will... the

time is upon us to put down the razor and let

our facial hair grow.

Philosophers: Socrates, Plato
and Aristotle. They laid the intel-
lectual foundations for all west-
ern culture — no big deal.

Scientists and thinkers: da
Vinci, Darwin and Freud. These
guys are scary smart, enough
said. And that’s not to mention
musicians, artists, actors and the
like.

all share beards. Who wouldn’t
want to emulate them?

How about an in-depth case
study of two such powerful
beards: those of famed and re-
cently deceased pitchman Billy
Mays and of cult ﬁgure and
professional badass Chuck Nor-
ris? These men undoubtedly fit
in among the world’s “greatest

thinkers, artists and revolution-
aries.” Billy’s passionate pitches
and Chuck’s unmatched mascu-
linity don’t exist because of spe-
cialized training or innate skill.
No, they exist because of these
men’s great beards. Glorious, full
and striking beards. If not shav-
ing throughout November makes
me half the man, nay, a twelfth
the man of either of these great
men, then I will be satisﬁed.

This month-long quest may
seem overly quixotic to some
and downright stupid to others,
but it is the truest test of one’s
self-control, willpower and
honor, even if it means putting
up with unsightly facial hair for
thirty days.

Mostly, however, I would like
to stress honor, which is particu-
larly apposite considering the
school we attend. If anyone is an
authority on honor, it is the revo-

lutionary who transformed our
institution - Robert E. Lee, who,
yes, rocked a beard.

The evidence seems to be
overwhelming: beards are great,
the growing of one is great, thus
No Shave November must be the
greatest month.

To those dedicated enough
to undertake this great venture:
Godspeed, and good luck.

Should we censor sexual assault or encourage discussion‘?

There are various coping methods, but victims of sexual assault shouldn ’t fear speaking up at W&L

Sexual assault is a much larger
problem at Washington and Lee
than it is on most college cam-
puses. END IT is a movement
that seeks to end sexual assault
at W&L no later than 2030.

Thus far, the publication of
survivor stories has been a very
important part of our attempt to
remove the shroud that has tradi-
tionally silenced this issue.

Not all survivors of sexual as-
sault deal with their experiences

the same way and in fact, there
is a huge range of reactions.
This makes it difﬁcult for END
IT to effectively confront the
sensitive issue of sexual assault
without making some individu-
als (whether affected by sexual
assault or not) uncomfortable.
While some survivors choose
to deal with their experiences
through ofﬁcial reporting and
professional counseling, others
choose only to confide in their

stories should be considered as
well.

Although sharing an account
of sexual assault is a difﬁcult
task, it is also a huge step in the
healing process for many indi-
viduals. Doing so anonymously
also removes the stigma from
these survivors and allows them
to overtly challenge the status
quo.

Many people on campus read
posters with our sexual assault
and rape statistics and openly
say that they do not believe the
numbers are accurate.

The aim of the stories is
therefore twofold. First to tell

ple can no longer ignore them or
say that they are untrue.

END IT respects the various
coping strategies of all survivors.
Nevertheless, sexual assault is
not just a personal problem; it is
also a social dilemma.

It is helpful to address it in a
public forum. If END IT were
to stop distributing accounts of
sexual misconduct, it may calm
the symptoms of individual sur-
vivors but would fail to address
the campus-wide problems of
disbelief and an unwillingness
to help.

campus culture.

Until now, it has been ta-
boo to admit to having been
sexually assaulted. END IT
would like to encourage and
empower survivors who wish
to share their stories and their
personal struggles with us,
their friends, a counselor, etc.

Our goal is to have all
members of the campus com-
munity join the dialogue. We
look forward to hearing your
questions, comments, and sto-
ries. Email us at endit@wlu.edu.

Defending the 27-time World Champion New York Yankees

After winning their ﬁrst World Series since 2000, a Yankee fan can ﬁnally breathe easily.

By Stockton Bullltt
OPINIONS EDITOR

It may not have been a big
deal for you, but this past Thurs-
day something special happened.

Yes, this special thing wasn’t
exactly new to the world, con-
sidering it had already occured
26 times, but still, it was special.
For the ﬁrst time in nine years,
the Yankees are champions of the
world.

Over the past few days, there
have been a plethora of com-
plaints about the Yankees win-
ning the World Series. They
were the ﬁrst ones to win with an
admitted steroid user. They got
incredibly lucky on their road to
victory. Finally, the biggest com-
plaint of all - they bought their
championship for a boatload of
money.

I would like to dispel some of
these erroneous arguments.

First of all, third baseman Alex
Rodriguez and pitcher Andy Pet-
tite were the ﬁrst players to win
a World Series win after being
caught with steroids.

This argument really has no
merit because everyone knows
there have been tons of convicted
steroid users who have polished
rings to make their shrunken tes-
ticles feel a little less tight. The
previous Yankees dynasty had
tons of steroid users, including
the aforementioned Andy Pet-
tite, who was only caught taking
HGH (a growth hormone that is
not as frowned upon as steroids),
Chuck Knoblach and Roger Cle-
mens.

In fact, every Word Series
winner from 1998-2005 had at
least one player convicted for

taking steroids. The only real
difference between this Yankee
team and previous World Series
winners is that the Yankee play-
ers simply got caught before
winning their rings.

Furthermore, if you are going
to get mad at Alex ‘Rodriguez,
think about this: he’s done much
worse things in his life. For ex-
ample, in July of 2008 Rodriguez
chose to cheat on his wife with
Madonna.

This is a huge travesty not be-
cause he cheated on his wife and
betrayed his kids, but because he
chose Madonna over his wife. I
cannot trust my third baseman to
spot out a ball being pitched at 90
miles an hour when he can’t see
that Madonna looks like a more
masculine version of Michael
Jackson.

Plus, in Alex Rodriguez’s
house, there are two paintings of
the Yankees star drawn as a cen-
taur.

The only real reason he had
as good of a postseason as he did
was because of Kate Hudson, his
new girlfriend. She’s so gorgeous
that when she left Owen Wilson,
he tried to kill himself. And he’s
Owen Wilson! I’m telling you,
Kate Hudson is like the real life
“Fever Pitch.”

Now, the second argument
against the Yankees is pretty
much true. There were tons of
games that were decided by
stupid coaching, the other team
making costly errors, question-
able calls from umpires, and
an overabundance of late game
comebacks.

However, the Yankees still
had all of those factors working
against them, especially in the
playoffs. Joe Girardi, the team’s
manager, tends to over manage
games because he is very inse-
cure about his job status. He’s
the kind of guy who would bet
on the St. Louis Rams just to go
with the numbers. Giradi more
than leveled out any kinds of
mistakes that any other manager
would make.

Moreover, for every bad call
or error that went the Yankees
way, the Yankees were met with
an error of their own or a blatant
make up call by an umpire. Fate
has a way of balancing things
out that way. Plus, in the World
Series, the Yankees had just as
many errors (two) as the Phillies.
Concerning late game come-
backs, every championship team
has late game luck on their side;
without it, you really can’t win a
World Series.

Now for the biggest jab
against the Yankees champion-
ship: the spending. Yes, the Yan-
kees have the highest payroll in
Major League baseball. Yes, their
inﬁeld makes more on a yearly
basis than some teams. For one,
the Yankees spent over $10 mil-
lion less dollars on their payroll
this year than they did last year.
In 2008, the Yankees didn’t even
make the playoffs, so complain-
ing that spending always equals
winning is dumb.

Besides, the Yankees are rare
in Major League Baseball in that
they make a signiﬁcant proﬁt
every year. They have their own

TV station, which they support
by themselves, and their new
stadium, despite being ridiculed
mercilessly by the media, has
helped signiﬁcantly raise the
team’s proﬁt margin. So, since
they have the money, which they
earned and shared with the rest
of the league, why shouldn’t they
spend it to make the best prod-
uct?

Major League Baseball is a
capitalist sport at its base. Every
single player is working for a
team, but their livelihood is pri-
marily based on how they play as
an individual. Although there is
some proﬁt sharing, each respec-
tive franchise in Major League

like a spoiled child talking, it
made the World Series loss to the
Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001
that much harder.

September 11 and the months
that followed was such a difficult
time in the city’s history. Every-
one in the New York metropoli-
tan area looked towards the Yan-
kees to give us redemption. I’m
not gonna lie, when Luis Gonza-
lez hit the series winning single
over Derek Jeter’s head in the
9th inning of Game 7, I bawled.
I cried harder than I did when
Mufasa died, and that’s saying
something.

Even worse than that game
was having the Boston Red Sox

Being from the suburbs of New York, the Yan-

kees have always had a special place in my

heart.

Baseball pretty much runs like
an independent company.

Therfore, is it unfair that Mc-
Donalds is able to spend more
money on advertising than Hard-
ees?

Although I love dispelling
myths about this championship
team, there is another reason for
me to write this article.

Being from the suburbs of
New York City, the Yankees have
always had a special place in my
heart.

ning World Series titles was a

Needless to say, it was mis-
erable. Worse was watching
the Yankees slow and steady
decline into obscurity. They be-
came a walking punch line at my
school.

I had to wait until I leﬂ my
high school full of Yankee haters

ambivalence to ﬁnally achieve
my redemption, which is still
nice. But not quite as nice as get-

Shag me, baby: learning to dance

Why house moms say W&L men need to learn to lead and why the sexy shag has people bopping in the Pavillion

By Mellssa Powell
STAFF WRITER

Phi Delta Theta’s house mom
thinks that Washington and Lee
University guys need to learn
how to dance.

Charlotte Moore, or “Momma
C” as she’s known in the Phi Delt
house, is introducing Lexington
to a unique style of dance: the
shag.

“It’s a beautiful dance,”
Moore said. ‘‘It teaches you how
to lead, and these guys on cam-
pus need to learn how to lead
instead of throwing girls all over
the place—that’s not dancing.”

Teaming up with Beta Theta
Pi’s house mom, Nancy Caban-
iss, Moore is offering shag dance
lessons at the Pavilion to stu-
dents, locals and W&L staff.

The shag, a dance that origi-
nated in the 1930s in clubs in
Myrtle Beach, S.C., was similar
to the jitterbug. However, by the
early 1950s, shag had slowed
down and adopted the tempo of
old rock-n-roll and blues mu-

sic of the times, now known as
beach music. Shag dancing was
one of the first examples of Af-
rican-American culture crossing
into the mainstream as many of
the dance moves were stolen
from segregated dance clubs.

The shag is a handheld dance
with a partner and a male lead.
The majority of the dance is
movement from the waist down,
while the top of the body stays
fairly still.

“Shag is sometimes consid-
ered dirty dancing,” Moore said.
“It can be very sultry, sexy and
very, very smooth.”

The basic steps are vital, and
once they have been learned,
more ﬂare can be added. Moore’s
lessons teach these necessary
steps but she says she is open to
expanding the lessons if people
want to learn more.

And those who become inter-
ested in learning the dance usu-
ally do want to continue taking

Washington Street
gets a tapas twist

New restaurant, Brix, opened for
Parents Weekend and of ers a new

taste for the hungry student

By Katle Boe and Stephanle Hardlman
surr WRITER AND ARTS 3. use EDITOR

Lexington recently welcomed
the addition of a new restaurant
and wine bar, Brix, located at 4
E. Washington Street.

Its opening was aptly timed
with Washington and Lee Uni-
versity’s Parents and Family
Weekend when a special menu
was offered.

Owner Hunter Smith timed
his opening with this weekend
not only to generate traﬂic in the
restaurant but also to provide an-
other venue for parents and their
children to share a delicious
meal.

The cozy and casual space,
seating just 30 people, offers
tapas style dishes and a broad
and affordable wine list, com-
posed of many local wines. A
slightly different brunch menu
is available on Sunday mornings
and afternoons.

ﬂavors of all the dishes are un-
doubtedly very fresh.

One of the best parts about
Brix is that you can choose mul-
tiple dishes~—each dish is served
family style——and avoid the in-
decisiveness some diners face
when looking at a menu with too
many great options.

The service at Brix was near-
ly ﬂawless and the atmosphere
was homey and welcoming. The
size of the restaurant is comfort-
able as well. The outdoor seat-
ing is ideal for a beautiful fall
day. Moreover, all of the food
is served as it is prepared so the
entire meal is staggered. Most
small dishes are in the $10 to
$30 range.

Smith, a native of Richmond,
has worked in the restaurant
business for more than 20 years
in both Charlottesville and Rich-

One staple of the menu is the tiramisu, a

signature dish, that is fantastic and the

perfect ending to a delicious meal. Its made

from marscapone from a local farm.

The menu is also set to
change frequently, giving a nice
change of pace to the average
diner who only has a few res-
taurants in Lexington to choose
from. Brix seems to ﬁll a niche
of simple and classic yet slightly
international cuisine.

One staple of the menu is the
tiramisu, a signature dish, that is
fantastic and the perfect ending
to a delicious meal. It’s made
with marscapone from a local
farm, Broadview Ranch, in the
Shenandoah Valley.

Diners can choose from meat,
seafood, vegetables, bread and
cheese dishes and many other
mouth-watering options.

The scallops and short ribs
were especially delectable as
was the focaccia bread, made in-
house daily. The seafood comes
from a new fresh ﬁsh market
located between Lexington and
Buena Vista.

Brix has also made use of
the space behind the building
by planting an herb garden. The

mond. He and chef Nathan Foun-
tain have created many simple
yet savory entrees for those who
choose to dine at Brix.

Brix welcomes reserva-
tions and walk-ins and is open

from 4 p.m. to midnight and
Sunday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Brix also has a Facebook page
with more information.

dancing that you want to do,”
Cabaniss said.

Like Moore, Cabaniss thinks
it’s important for young men to
learn how to lead in a dance. She
tells “her boys” in Beta that it’s
important for them to be able
to dance at social functions like
weddings or even Fancy Dress.

Roanoke area listening to beach
music and her love of the music
generated interest in the shag
dance. Moore also discovered
the dance through the music,
which she ﬁrst heard on a Roa-
noke radio station. Both women
went to shag dancing clubs and
fell in love with it.

Moore often attends shag
dance parties on the weekends
and she loves being able to meet
people from all over the South-
east who share such a unique
common interest.

“We dance from daylight to
daylight,” Moore said.

While Moore and Cabaniss
have much experience with the
female part of the dance, they
had to hire an instructor from
Lynchburg who knows both the
male lead and female part of the
dance to help with the lessons.

Three lessons have already
taken place but students and staff
are still encouraged to start at-
tending. Make-up lessons will be
arranged for those who start late.
Anyone who purchases the six
lesson package for $30 is guar-
anteed six lessons.

Moore and Cabaniss’ contact
information is provided in Cam-
pus Notices as is information on
the times of the lessons. The next

scheduled lesson is on Sunday,
Nov. 15 in the Pavilion and at-
tendees can come as a couple or
individually.

If attending the lessons, make
sure to wear shoes with leather
soles or anything slick. Other
than that, there is no dress code
and any outﬁt is acceptable.

So far, the lessons have had
an attendance of about 10-15
people, according to Moore.
However, more people are al-
ways welcome as Moore and Ca-
baniss wish to share this unique
opportunity with as many in the
W&L community as possible.

“It’s a beautiful dance,”
Moore said. “It’s a sexy dance.
Anyone who sees it danced will
want to learn it.”

_ Volleyball snaps Winning streak

The Generals ended their season this weekend with a 3-2 loss to Roanoke in the ﬁrst round of the ODAC tournament

By Brlelle Welnsteln
surr warren

The Washington and Lee University
volleyball team’s stunning 13-game win-
ning streak came to a disappointing end
as the Generals struggled in the Seahawk
Invitational St. Mary’s Tournament and
dropped their ﬁrst round ODAC match-
up to Roanoke, 3-2.

Traveling to St. Mary’s over Parents
Weekend, the Generals saw their ﬁrst
defeat when they fell to Salisbury 3-0
with game scores of 25-18, 25-17, 25-
19. Junior outside hitter Marah Schmitz
and junior middle blocker Louise Brooks
offset the loss with 11 and 10 kills re-
spectively. Other shining performances
included senior Megan Steinhardt’s 27
assists and ﬁrst-year libero Cameron
Hill’s 14 digs.

The Generals returned to the court
later that afternoon to face Gallaudet
but suffered another setback, falling 3-1
at 25-21, 23-25, 25-20, 25-21. Leading
the offense, junior setter Jenna Finger
left the court with 35 assists and 11 digs

while senior outside hitter Rachael Phil-
lips recorded 15 kills and three blocks.

The Generals ﬁnished the weekend
with a 3-0 loss to Eastern, falling 25-

ence playoffs.
Roanoke posted an 18-25, 15-25, 25-

and Brooks added nine and seven kills
to the team respectively.

Back to their usual dominance, W&L
rebounded with a 3-0 victory over St.
Mary’s at 25-19, 25-15, 25-17 the next
morning. Steinhardt led the team on the
offensive front with 41 assists while Hill
took control of the defense with 19 digs.
Schmitz governed the court with 13 kills
while Brooks and Phillips added nine

15, 25-18, 25-12. Steinhardt led with 24
assists while Schmitz contributed eight
kills and ﬁrst-year Bailey Walker con-
tributed seven kills. Hill notched 11 digs
and Finger added nine digs in the loss.
In the ODAC tournament this week-
end, the Generals battled for victory but
fell short to Roanoke College. W&L had
a tremendous season, but coming off the
rough St. Mary’s tournament they were

20, 27-25, 19-17 victory over the No.
2 seeded Generals. The defeat marked
the ﬁrst time since 2000 that Roanoke
has beat W&L and brought an end to
the Generals’ eight-year title-winning
streak.

W&L came out of the gate well aﬁer
winning the ﬁrst two games but was un-
able to keep it up throughout the whole
match.

With the entire gym cheering against
them, the team knew the signiﬁcance for
Roanoke to be playing W&L.

Senior setter Kristi Stevens set the
tone for the match with 59 assists and
12 digs while Hill notched 23 digs. The
offense was led by Phillips with 20 kills,
12 digs and four blocks, Schmitz with
20 kills and 11 digs and Brooks with 15
kills and six digs.

“Even though the outcome wasn’t
what they wanted it to be, the team had
amazing chemistry and is proud of what
they accomplished,” said Phillips.

She said she hopes the returning
players can carry the strides the team
made into next season.

Generals’ football ends season on a disappointing note

W&L fell to Bridgewater 35-34 over Parents Weekend and ended its season with a 23-1 6 loss to Emory & Henry

By Andrew Bonds
STAFF WRITER

The Generals lost a close game to
Emory and Henry 23-16 to close out
their season with a ﬁnal record of 3-7
overall and 2-4 in the ODAC confer-
ence.

Washington and Lee was out gained
on the ground 283-119 as Emory and
Henry was able to slow the traditionally
strong rushing attack.

Led by quarterback Drew Piscopo,
the Wasps also threw for two touch-
downs in Saturday’s contest at Fullerton .
ﬁeld, overcoming an early Generals’
lead with a balanced second half perfor-
mance and effective defense.

The Generals came out of the gates
quickly, jumping to a 3-0 lead on junior
kicker Martin Pritchard’s ﬁeld goal. The
kick capped off a 15-play, 68-yard drive
that seemed to set the tone for the early
stages of the game.

However, the Wasps quickly re-
sponded with a long drive of their own
and Piscopo dived into the end zone on
a two-yard quarterback sneak.

Field Hockey falls to Eastern Mennonite

W&L defeats Roanoke in ODAC quarterﬁnals, then falls 3-] in semiﬁnals

By Stephen Peck
smrr wnmza

It was a tough weekend for the Wash-
ington and Lee University Field Hockey
team as they saw their season and ODAC
championship dreams end at the hands of
the Eastern Mennonite University Lady
Royals.

The Generals defeated Roanoke 4-0 in
the quarterﬁnals of the ODAC tournament
but lost to EMU 3-1 in the semiﬁnals on
Saturday.

Last Tuesday, W&L enjoyed a home
ﬁeld advantage for the ﬁrst round of the
ODAC conference tournament as they
hosted Roanoke College. Going into the

Offensive play stalled in the second
quarter and the Generals and the Wasps
exchanged ﬁeld goals to bring it to 10-6
with only 52 seconds left in the half.

But it was just enough time for the
Wasps to put together a quick four-play
54-yard drive, scoring on a Piscopo
touchdown pass to Jonathan Hawkins
in just 39 seconds. The play gave the
Wasps a 17-6 lead and a surge of mo-
mentum heading into halftime.

The second half continued, as had
much of the game, with little scoring
and a lot of running plays by both teams.
With 6:52 left in the third quarter, Pisco-
po once again found receiver Hawkins
for a 13-yard pass to take the lead 23-6.

The Generals caught a break when
Emory and Henry’s place-kicker, Matt
Turchin, failed to convert the extra
point. Taking the advantage in hand,
W&L then looked to climb back into
the game and responded with a one—yard
touchdown run by sophomore running
back Jonathan Clemo.

“I think it got to a point that we were
tired of losing and made a commitment to
play the whole game without any lulls in
intensity,” Armstrong said of the team’s
shutout streak.

“The coaching staff stepped it up and
really worked with us on defense and
I think it is has made a huge difference.
This year we worked a lot on defense tac-
tics and it made it possible for us to have
these six shut outs.”

With the victory, the Generals moved
on to the conference semiﬁnal game and
were set to face the EMU Lady Royals.

“This team was the best I ’ve ever seen for the pro-

gram, and the group of women were wonderful to

play and train with. I am very disappointed that all

this work didn ’t end how we wanted it. ”

Sallle Armstrong, senlor forward

game, the Generals were riding the mo-
mentum of a dominant ﬁve-game shutout
streak and were sitting pretty as the No.3
seed. They continued using their winning
formula of smothering defense and a re-
lentless offense to secure their win over
Roanoke.

Seniors Alex Caritis (2), Sallie Arm-
strong and Grace McGee all scored in the
contest to run the ﬁnal score to 4-0.

The Generals ﬁred 24 shots on the Ma-
roons’ cage while only allowing ﬁve shots
on their own. W&L goalkeepers senior
Caroline Habliston and ﬁrst-year Kirsten
Kyne did not even have to make a save
as they combined to post the team’s sixth
straight shutout victory.

The last time W&L lost a game, it was a
6-0 shellacking to this same EMU team.

This time around, the Generals looked
to have their revenge on the Lady Roy-
als and plow ahead to the championship
game. Unfortunately it was not to be as
W&L battled hard but came up just short
in a 3-1 defeat.

W&L found themselves in a 2-0 hole
early in the game but ﬁrst-year Katherine
Price found the back of the cage to make
it 2-1 at the half and hopefully spark a
comeback.

EMU proved a bit too tough however
as they scored an insurance goal and al-
lowed only one W&L shot in the second
half.

With 5:24 left in the game, W&L
brought the game even closer, convert-
ing a Pritchard ﬁeld goal once again to
bring the game to 23-16 and even more

win in a hard-fought game.

On the day, Clemo led the Gener-
als with 96 yards rushing and a touch-
down and Hudson rushed nine times for

Jonathan Clemo.‘ 96 rushing yards, one touchdown

Harrison Hudson: 39 rushing yards, 41 receiving yards
Charlie Westfal: I 2 for 28 with 128 yards
Donovan Sawyer: 13 tackles

importantly, to make the battle a one-
possession game. After recovering the
subsequent onside kick, the Generals
looked ready to attack the Wasps’ lead.
But after losing yards on the drive, they
were forced to punt.

Ultimately, the Wasps were able to
run out the clock, pulling out with the

39 yards, adding 41 yards receiving as
well. Quarterback Charlie Westfal went
12-for—28 with 128 yards as the Gener-
als relied mostly on the running game on
Saturday.

The Generals’ defense, led by senior
safety Donovan Sawyer and his 13 tack-
les, had one of their better games to date

statistically.

Although the Generals ﬁnished out
the year on a somewhat disappointing
note, with Saturday’s loss following the
overtime 35-34 loss to Bridgewater over
Parents Weekend, they look to build
from a solid foundation of underclass-
men heading into next year.

With the loss of many multiple-sea-
son starting seniors, there will be some
turnover on the roster next year. Return-
ing their leading rushers, quarterback
and a signiﬁcant part of the defense, the
Generals will certainly have high hopes
heading into next season.

“We had a better game [against EMU]
than last time, but I know we had more
and cou1d’ve beat them,” Armstrong
said. “But they showed up to play and we
couldn’t match that.”

In the blink of an eye, the team’s win-
ning streak, conference championship run
and season were over, but such is life in a
single elimination tournament.

The Generals’ season was a roller
coaster ride of emotion in and of itself.
The team stumbled to a 1-4 start to the
year but slowly climbed their way back
near the top of the ODAC.

Armstrong ﬁnished her illustrious ca-
reer at W&L with a 37-point campaign
and along the way set the school career
scoring record. Soon after she set the
mark, the team suffered a couple tough
losses to EMU and Mary Washington but
it responded with its six-game shutout
streak.

It was disappointing to see such a
magical year end so soon.

“The team this year was the best I’ve
ever seen for the program and the group
of women were wonderful to play and
train with,” Armstrong said. “I am very
disappointed that all this work didn’t end
how we wanted it. I really believe that
this was the team to win ODACs and it’s.
really disappointing that we fell short our
last year here.”

Soccer claims championship

V W&L women is soccer claimed its third ODAC title in school history

By Brooke Sutherland
spears EDITOR

It came down to the wire, but the
Washington and Lee women’s soccer team
walked away with an ODAC champion-
ship on Saturday. After drawing 0-0 with
Virginia Wesleyan, the Lady Generals de-
feated Virginia Wesleyan 3-2 in penalty
kicks to claim the championship.

The Generals’ solid backline provided
the ﬁerce defense the team needed to keep
the Marlins at bay, but W&L struggled to
get shots off. The Generals trailed 21-8 to
the Marlins in shot attempts for all 110
minutes of play.

“They’re a team that’s constantly ro-
tating their forwards,” said sophomore
forward Anne Masich. “Everything is
boomed forward to get their shots whereas
we play a more relaxed game.”

In the penalty round, the Marlins struck
ﬁrst, going up 1-0 after a goal from senior
midﬁelder Nicki Mazzoccone. Virginia
Wesleyan looked poised to take control of
the shootout after W&L’s ﬁrst two kick-
ers, senior midﬁelder Maggie Sutherland
and sophomore defender Corinne Smith,
missed their shots.

But W&L, a team that has tasted de-
feat only once this season was not about to
give up its claim to the championship.

The Generals’ next three penalty kicks
had no trouble ﬁnding the net. Sophomore
defender Kat Lawson, sophomore mid-
ﬁelder Page Minton and ﬁrst-year mid-
ﬁelder Ainsley Daigle all scored to give
the Generals the win.

“We never gave up despite missing our
two penalty kicks,” Masich said.

Goalkeeper Emily Leary dominated in
the net for the Generals. The sophomore
played the entire 110 minutes, recording
eight saves and two stops in the shootout
to help deliver the Generals to ODAC
tournament glory.

“I think it’s awesome because this is

something we’ve worked for the entire
season,” Masich said. “This is what our
season is about. Even though we took
the hardest road to the championship, we
stuck it out and we won.”

The win marked a sweep of the ODAC
tournament for the Generals. In the quar-
terﬁnals, W&L defeated Guilford 2-0
recording its 13th shutout of the season.
The win avenged the Generals’ 1-1 tie to

scoring one goal early in the ﬁrst half to
prevent a shutout. But Lynchburg was no
match for the unstoppable W&L defense
as the Hornets failed to score again in the
match-up.

“I’d just say that overall we’ve main-
tained good defense through communica-
tion on the ﬁeld during both games and
practice,” Smith said. “It’s helped us to
keep opponents to scoring a minimum

“I think its awesome because this is something we ’ve

worked for the entire season. This is what our season is

about. ”

Anne Masich, sophomore forward

Guilford just a week earlier. The Gener-
als dominated the offense, leading the
Quakers 21-1 in shot attempts. Daigle and
sophomore forward Allie Espina put up
the Generals’ two goals off assists from
ﬁrst-year midﬁelder Hannah Sackﬁeld and
Masich, respectively. Once again, Leary
took control of the goal for the Generals,
playing all 90 minutes and recording one
save in the shutout.

“The game against Guilford was a re-
ally big game just in terms of coming back
from tying them the weekend before,”
said Smith. “I think of that game as us
taking revenge from the weekend before.
Just keeping them scoreless proved that
we could come back from the upsetting
game.”

The Generals next faced Lynchburg
in the semiﬁnals. The Hornets fared bet-
ter than most of the Generals’ opponents,

number of goals.”

A goal by Sutherland off an assist from
Lawson and a late goal by Espina off an
assist from ﬁrst-year midﬁelder Katie
Howard gave the Generals the 2-1 victory
to send them to the championship game.

The title is the ﬁrst for the Lady Gener-
als since 2003 and only their third ODAC
championship in school history.

“Winning an ODAC championship is
a really big deal and I think especially for
our seniors they know how important and
exciting this is for us,” Smith said. “Go-
ing into the NCAA tournament is always
exciting because you don’t realize how
tough it is to get into the tournament and
how great an opportunity it is.”

The win gives the Generals an auto-
matic bid to the NCAA tournament. Their
ﬁrst opponent has yet to be announced.

Swimming improves record

Both teams dominated against T ranslyvania and earned wins over the weekend

There was nothing frightful about Hal-
loween for Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s men’s and women’s swim teams this
year. The two teams scored a dual victory
in a meet with Transylvania on the spooky
holiday.

The men defeated Transylvania 161-
97, while the Lady Generals took a 150-
110 victory. Sophomores Jocelyn Cassada
and Elizabeth Stames both claimed two
victories for the Generals. Cassada won
the 100 backstroke with a time of 1:03.54
and was also a member of the winning 200
medley relay squad that came in ﬁrst with
a time of 1:55.13. Stames came in ﬁrst

Childers and Jonathan Giesen rounding
out the squad.

The winning 200 free relay ﬁnished
with a time of 1:30.08. Talluri was joined
on that squad by junior Brandon Wilder,
sophomore Ian Dexter and ﬁrst-year
Wayde Marsh.

In other victories for the Generals,
Winston Stagg took ﬁrst in both the 200
butterﬂy (2:02.31) and 200 IM (2:02.77).
Childers added to his wins for the day with
a victory in the 200 breaststroke for W&L
with a time of 2:20.22. Several sophomore
swimmers also gave the Generals a boost.

ed Randolph Macon 150-112.

“At the ﬁrst break we were down by
nine points, but everyone stepped up to the
challenge and we pulled out a win,” said
Fredricks. “Anne McCampbell has a great
1000 freestyle where she came from be-
hind to grab second. Stames had an awe-
some 500 free. Lynn Bazzel almost went
a lifetime best and won the 100 breast.
The best part was ending the meet with a
sweep in the 200 IM.”

Senior Lynn Bassel showed her leader-
ship, taking ﬁrst place victories in both the
100 and 200 breaststroke at 1:08.76 and
2233.36 respectively.

The Generals were also helped by a
strong sophomore effort. Cassada repeat-
ed her victory in the 100 backstroke with
a time of 1:03.80. and Salvati took ﬁrst in
the 200 backstroke (2215.57).

‘Fredericks took ﬁrst in 200 IM at
2: 19.88 while Stames took another victory
in the 200 freestyle at 5:22:97.

While the women were taking down
Randolph Macon, the men travelled to
Charlotte, North Caroline for a two-day
meet against Wingate, Rollins and Ca-
tawba. The Generals defeated Catawba,
248-65, and Rollins, 238-77, but fell short
to Wingate with a score of 220-95. The
men’s team now stands 4-2 on the season.

The 200 free relay team of seniors Tal-
luri and Brandon Bamds, sophomore Dex-
ter and ﬁrst-year Rick Sykes grabbed sec-
ond place with the time of 1:27:53. Talluri,
along with Childers and sophomores Chris
Washnock and Jeff Stirling, also earned
second place in the 400 medley relay at
3:39.10. The 200 medley relay team of
Bamds, Stagg, sophomore Brian Stirling
and Marsh, put up another second-place
ﬁnish with a time of 1:39.66.

The strongest event for the Generals,
however, appeared to be the 200 butterﬂy
where W&L took a 1-2-3-4 ﬁnish. Wilder
came in ﬁrst at 2:00.21, followed by Gon-
zalez at 2:00.69, sophomore Ryan Hart-
man at 2:02.02 and Stagg at 2:02.41.

Washnock also recorded a second
place ﬁnish in the 100 back at 54.99, while
Childers took second in the 200 breast-
roke. Brian Stirling and Jeff Stirling went
back-to-back for second and third place
ﬁnishes in the 100 butterﬂy with times of
53.32 and 53.33 respectively to round out
the victories for the Generals.

. The next meet for the men will be Nov.
21 when they swim against Carnegie Mel-
lon and Rochester in Pittsburgh, Pa. The
women face off against Sweet Briar at
home on Nov. 13.

VOLUME CXIII, NUMBER 8

Generals
support soldiers

Student atheletes assemble
care packages for men

serving overseas

By Kirsten Kyne
STAFF WRITER

On Friday, November 13, members from every
varsity sports team at Washington and Lee gathered
in Warner Athletic Complex to assemble 486 care
packages to send to the members of the Black Hawk
Battalion of the 82nd Airborne Division in Afghani-
stan. .

This event was organized by the Student Athlete
Advisory Committee, commonly known as SAAC.
This service project has been happening every year
for the past three years and according to senior Sal-
lie Armstrong, this year was “as smooth as it’s ever
been,” despite the increase in packages being sent to
Afghanistan from around 200 in previous years.

In order to make this project possible, each sports
team was assigned a certain item to collect. Items in-
cluded toothpaste, toothbrushes, magazines, candy,
crackers, and instant drink powders. Each team had
a different strategy for collecting their items. Some
teams had each athlete bring in a certain number of
their particular item while others collected money
and had one player purchase their items in bulk.

“I was in charge of collecting the toothpaste from
the ﬁeld hockey team and making sure each girl
brought in their ﬁve toothpastes,” junior Kate Don-
nelly said. “I also had to make sure that everyone
from the team came today to help ﬁll the boxes.”

Athletes were excited to participate in this fun
event.

“It’s good to do. Everyone needs a morale boost-
er some time,” senior Caroline Habliston said.

Freshman Alex Hamill helped collect Twinkies
and Hostess cakes to send in the boxes with her la-
crosse team. Hamill expressed that collecting the
snacks was just a small way to thank the soldiers.

“It’s good to give back to the soldiers who are
sacriﬁcing so much for us and to thank them,” she
said.

Many athletes also enjoyed writing the handwrit-
ten letters to place in each of the boxes.

“I would try to write about current events or ev-
eryday things to just give them a break from what’s
going on over there,” Habliston said.

Every athlete would put together at least one care
package and place a handwritten letter to each of the
soldiers. The letters could be about anything and
some even used their artistic abilities to try to bright-
en the servicemen and women’s days.

Athletic Director Jan Hathom said she was proud
of the athletes at W&L.

“It’s fabulous. Any time we can think about
things greater than us, it’s a great thing,” she said.
“It helps put things in perspective. It lets us know
that there’s something bigger than us going on.”

Hathom feels that the athletes at W&L are so will-
ing to participate in activities like the SAAC Care
Packages because they have a sense of teamwork.

“We’re all just one giant team, metaphorically
speaking,” she said. “We support each other and are
willing to help others.”

Not only did athletes participate in this event,
but the Lexington community joined in to make this
year the most successful yet.

“We got a lot of money and many donations,”
said Armstrong.

Many community members came on Friday to
help assemble the boxes and, according to Arm-
strong, “we ﬁnished early because we had so much
help.”

Some faculty members even joined in for the
cause. Thomas Bane, known as “Baner” to students,
donated 486 copies of his book, Family and Honor,
to SAAC to be included in the package. This will
help show the soldiers the importance of honor at
our institution and how athletes are so appreciative
of what the soldiers are sacriﬁcing.

The care packages are expected to be sent later
this week and should arrive in Afghanistan at the end
of November. “I think [the care packages] will be a
little bit of excitement for the soldiers,” Habliston
said. “I hope it will brighten their days a little bit.”

W&L can expect to see more things from SAAC
in the future. .

“We’re trying to organize an Athletes’ Formal in
the spring and have better communication between
teams and the faculty,” said Donnelly. “Every year
we try to incorporate athletics with service.”

SAAC also plans to coordinate more service
events.

“I think [the athletes] are excited to help outand
are always excited to unite,” said Donnelly. “These
projects create opportunities to meet people from
other teams.”

Recent spike in HIN] virus hits

Rockbridge County High School and
W&L with a record number of cases

By Jessica Strait
STAFF WRITER

As swine ﬂu continues to remain
a threat on Washington and Lee’s
campus and the number of cases rise,
Rockbridge County High School re-
cently experienced an outbreak of
the HlNl virus that has resulted in a
large number of student absences.

RCHS Nurse Karen Tolley said
she usually sees an average 25 to 30
students per week in her ofﬁce, but
lately the number has increased to
closer to 50. During the week of Oc-
tober 12 to 16, Tolley saw 220 stu-
dents of the school’s approximately
1032 total students, and 95 were sent
home. An increase in swine ﬂu cases
has also been observed in RCHS
teachers. Tolley said she treats any
presence of ﬂu symptoms in students
as swine ﬂu, instead of speciﬁcally
testing for the HlNl virus. Students
typically stay home for a few days
after diagnosis.

“We follow the Center for Dis-
ease Control protocol, but we go one
step further,” Tolley said. “If there is
diarrhea or throwing up, we ask that
the student be symptom-free from
that for 24 hours before returning to
school.”

Although Tolley said the numbers
have now leveled off almost back
to normal, she expects HlNl to hit
again, harder, closer to the regular
ﬂu season, which usually peaks in
November and lasts until March or
April. But Tolley said RCHS is pre-
pared for the virus.’

“We’re getting vaccines by next

week and have already treated grade
schools in the Rockbridge County
area,” said Tolley.

Tolley said she would like the
high school to have sanitation sta-
tions, but that RCHS currently does
not have any signiﬁcant swine ﬂu
prevention measures in place.

W&L is a different storynumer-
ous sanitation stations, hand-wash-
ing reminders, “ﬂu buddy” posters
and swine ﬂu prevention tips can be
seen around campus, all part of the
“aggressive communications plan”
designed to alert‘. students and the
community to the threat of swine ﬂu.
To date, there have been a total of 78
recorded cases of swine ﬂu on cam-
pus since Aug. 29.

Dr. Jane Horton, MD., Director '

of Student Health and Counseling at
W&L, said the prevalence of swine
ﬂu at W&L is what she expected,
and is comparable to other small,
residential campuses. The average
weekly attack rate was similar to
the national rate up until the ‘week
of Oct. 31 to Nov. 6, when 17 cases
were recorded on campus.

“We have seen an increase in cas-
es of inﬂuenza-like illness,” Horton
said. “We need to reinforce both pre-
ventative measures and encourage
people who are sick to stay home to
avoid spreading the illness.”

On Nov. 9, students received an e-
mail from Dean Watkins, Vice Presi-
dent of Student Affairs and Dean of
Students, acknowledging that the

week of October 3 1 brought the high-
est number of cases in a single week
since classes began. Watkins asked
employees to self-report illnesses,
encouraged University members to
get the vaccine if they can ﬁnd it and
reminded members of the commu-
nity of basic preventative measures,
like washing hands often, avoiding
close contact with sick people and
covering your nose or mouth with a
tissue when you cough or sneeze.

Like RCHS, the Health Center is
not testing for swine ﬂu, and instead
presumes that any “inﬂuenza-like ill-
ness” is swine ﬂu, becauseiaccording
to the Centers for Disease Control,
HlNl is the only strain currently cir-
culating in the U.S. A few inﬂuenza
A tests have been done to make sure
inﬂuenza is in fact what the Health
Center is dealing with, but for the
most part, the doctors are diagnos-
ing and treating students without any
testing.

And like Tolley, Horton believes
the worst is yet to come, predict-
ing more inﬂuenza-like illness this
winter than usual due to both the
HlNl and seasonal ﬂu strains that
will be circulating. Dr. Horton en-
courages students to get both a sea-
sonal ﬂu vaccine and the H1Nl ﬂu
vaccine. The Student Health Center
is out of the seasonal ﬂu vaccine, so
Horton said students should check
with personal physicians at home
over Thanksgiving break for vac-
cine availability. Each individual

 

student’s decision to receive a vac-
cination now will make a big differ-
ence come ﬂu season time, because
“the more of the population that is
immunized, the less likely we are
to have a big outbreak this winter,”
Horton said.

Horton said an “ample supply” of
the H1N1 vaccine for students and
at-risk faculty and staff in both the
nasal mist and injectable fonn has
been ordered but not yet received.
Other campus health centers have
begun to receive vaccines in small
allotments, so Horton expects W&L
to soon receive at least a fraction of
the ordered vaccinations.

Students will be notiﬁed via cam-
pus notices when the HlN1 vaccine
is available on campus. Any students
with an underlying medical condition
that increases their risk for swine ﬂu
will receive an e-mail and be made
a top priority for the initial supply
of HlNl vaccines. Healthy students
are encouraged to take the nasal mist
form of the vaccine, which will be
more common.

An outbreak of swine ﬂu ﬁrst hit
W&L last April. Information about
swine ﬂu and an up-to-date chart
keeping track of cases on campus

Travel|er’s new code of conduct

Misbehavior and disrespect no longer tolerated; new rules enforced for safety of all

By Lizz Dye
s TA F F w R I T E R

On Saturday night bodies cram
into Traveller, all vying for a ride
back to Red Square or the Quad.
After the night’s festivities, drunken
shouts and slurred’ words sound off
in the cab of the bus, and sometimes
in the cacophony, individuals get out
of hand—yelling profanities, shout-
ing at drivers and even tossing the
stray beer in the face of a Traveller
monitor. However, in light of recent
events, certain changes have been
put in play.

Katie Boiles, chair of the Travel-
ler System, discussed the new “Trav-
eller Conduct System”, which she
and all of the other Traveller drivers
hope will improve the current situa-
tion. The Traveller employees actu-

I ally created a public relations com-

mittee for Traveller right before the
recent accident involving a student
because they realized there were
changes in behavior that needed to
be addressed.

This new system’s purpose is to
“create a system of accountability
for students whose conduct with the
Traveller System is not consistent
with the values of the university,”
and will be implemented during
the ﬁrst week of operations of Win-
ter Term. Boiles said that it should
“encourage people to model their
behavior in an appropriate way” and
that there should be consequences
for actions.

The system is deﬁned by a se-
ries of sanctions that any Traveller
employee can issue. A ﬁrst sanction
is a $25 ﬁne, a second sanction is a

$50 ﬁne, and a third sanction means
that the offender is suspended from
the Traveller System for the entire
semester. Any behavior that seems
particularly egregious may be for-
warded to the SJC for particular ac-
tion.

A lot of behavior that has been
sliding by will no longer be toler-
ated on Traveller. Some rules that
will be particularly enforced include
no"alcohol or unsealed beverages
on Traveller and treating Traveller
employees with respect. Refusal to
comply when asked to exit an over-
loaded van or bus, verbal abuse of
Traveller employees (drivers, moni-
tors and dispatchers), and pushing
and shoving that causes harm to
other passengers could all result in
disciplinary action.

A lot of the inappropriate behav-
ior that has occurred is also extreme-
ly harmful and can result in acci-
dents like the one that occurred this
year. This new system will prevent
accidents like this from occurring
and will aim to make Traveller stops
a more peaceful and pleasant place.

Boiles is particularly excited
about installing corral systems at
the Pole Houses and Windfall, and
eventually the Cabins and Kappa
Hill. The system will act like a corral
system for cattle, so that “the mob”
waiting for Traveller does not rush
the bus due to not having a designat-

ed line. This was suggested by the ~

Traveller drivers, who display their
anxiety about pushing, shoving and
crowding from inebriated students

who are clearly behaving more like
cattle than people.

Boiles also wanted to remind
students that if they are on Travel-
ler and a driver asks them their name
and they falsely identify themselves,
it will be treated as an honor viola-
tion.

More changes may soon be com-
ing as well. Next year, the Traveller
system may require students to show
their W&L student IDs when they

' get on the bus so drivers can identify

students who are misbehaving, such
as students throwing beer in moni-
tors’ faces while waiting for Travel-
ler. This potential new measure is
not meant to implicate students who
are under 21 and drinking.

Between now and winter break,
there will be signs around campus
detailing the new “Traveller Con-
duct System.” Megan Steinhardt and
Director of Health and Promotion
Jane Kaufman have designed “Toilet
Time with Traveller,” which students
will be able to view all over campus
while doing their business.

Boiles and the rest of the Travel-
ler team hope that these new sanc-
tions will not only act as a wake up
call for those who choose to disre-
gard basic courtesy, but also make
the Traveller system safe for all who
participate in it—whether it be driv-
ing, monitoring or getting that late
night ride back from the country.

The bestof the Internet: procrastinating in college

Have a paper to write tonight, but don ’t really want to write it? Jonathan Salm outlines your procrastination future.

By Jonathan Salm
c o LU M N I sr

It’s Sunday night. You have
a six-page paper on God knows
what due in the morning and it
is rapidly approaching 11 p.m.
After wasting about an hour in
the co—op eating and talking to
whoever will listen, you ﬁnally
decide to get serious and head to
the library.

Resisting the urge to talk to

' anyone on the main ﬂoor, you

head down into the depths of
Leyburn, open up your laptop,
and begin—or so you plan.

Before opening up Microsoft
Word, you decide to click on that
alluring fox wrapped around the
globe, the striking ‘e’ symbol
or the tempting compass. And
for you cool kids, you open up
Google Chrome or Opera. And
then it begins~—not the paper,
but the long, oﬂen tranquil pro-
cess of procrastination. I would
know—-I do this on a weekly
basis and consider myself an ex-
pert authority on the art that is
procrastination. If you continue
reading, you might become one,
too.

The ﬁrst stop on the Internet
for procrastinators is social net-
working sites. Facebook has be-

come the overwhehning‘ favorite, . ’

but kudos to those who still stick
with Myspace, despite its obvi-
ous inferiority. Check some no-
tiﬁcations, write on some walls,
lurk on some proﬁles or pictures,
and bam—there go thirty min-
utes.

Pro tip: leave Facebook up
when you ﬁnally do begin writ-
ing that paper. In the middle of
an especially arduous paragraph,
expect to be rescued by Face-
book’s dreamy ‘pop’ sound, sig-
nifying a new instant message.
You get anywhere from two min-
utes to a full hour of procrastina-
tion time from this.

After checking statuses, friend
requests and the like, it’s time for
some music, beyond what is al‘-
ready playing on iTunes. (It’s a
given that any college student
with a laptop has iTunes running
at all times). So you head to Pan-
dora.com, a music recommenda-
tion site birthed out of the futur-
istic Music Genome Project.

The listener puts in a song
or artist, and Pandora spits out
a variety of tunes that matches
the original based upon over 400
“musical attributes” as coded by
the Music Genome Project. Pan-
dora is a great way to discover
new music and an even greater
way to waste time.

If Pandora helps you discover
that certain sound that you’ve
been searching for since forever,
or if you just HAVE to listen to
every song Nickelback has ever
written (just kidding, I assume
that most W&L students have
more sophisticated taste in mu-
sic than that), head on over to
imeem.com.

Think of imeem as a better,
free version of the iTunes store.

THE MEDIA BOARD

Although it is completely free,
unlike iTunes, you still can’t pur-
chase any of the songs from the
site itself. However, imeem does
offer streaming tunes from all
four major labels, and the ability
to create and publish playlists,
similar to iTunes’ iMix feature.
If you know exactly what you’re
looking for, imeem reigns su-
preme.

After music, why not go for
movies or TV shows? YouTube
is the obvious choice here, but
it is hindered by an overﬂow of
stupidity that serves to demon-
strate how unintelligent the hu-
man race truly is. Case study:
“Leave Britney Alone.”

If you know what you want,
YouTube is great. Otherwise, I
should warn you, prepare to have
your intelligence lowered, which
could adversely affect that paper
you should be writing. Remem-
ber, the one due in fewer than ten
hours?

As an alternative to YouTube,
I suggest Hulu. While there are
a variety of borderline-legal sites
streaming both movies and TV
shows that somehow manage to
remain active, they all pale in
comparison.

Started in 2007 with the over-
ly quixotic vision of streaming
high quality TV shows and mov-
ies from major networks and stu-
dios, Hulu has in fact done just
that. Currently, NBC Universal,
Fox Entertainment Group and

ABC are partners. Go to Hulu to
catch up on favorites you missed
this week or to discover some-
thing brand new.

So far, about three to four
hours of time have been wasted
if you have effectively visited
each previously mentioned site.
Care for more? Check out FMy-
Life (FML), MyLifeIsAverage
(MLIA), and Texts From Last
Night (TFLN).

Here’s the deal. I absolutely
hate each one of these sites with
umnatched passion and anger.
Sure, they might be insanely pop-
ular with teenagers and college
students alike, but after brows-
ing each one for about a minute
apiece, I always want to puke.
Oh really—exam in an hour!!
OMG haven’t started studying
yeti! FMLII A more appropriate
FML would be something like,
“Living in Darfur. Might die to-
day. We’ll see. FML.”

While each post might in-
volve a mildly uncomfortable
event resulting in some hardship,
it’s hard to see any of these posts’
authors being in a situation where
their lives are truly f%#$ed.

MLIA acts as the opposite
of FML, but that doesn’t mean
it’s any less nauseating. TFLN
is even worse. The stupidity of
these texts posted online makes
me embarrassed to even own a
phone. Ranging from wtf-worth-
ly sexual encounters to boastful
claims of inhumane drinking,

TFLN culls together the worst
part of college and young adult
life and slaps it together on a
webpage.

If a trio of the worst sites,
popular and procrastination-won
thy nonetheless, can be compared
with a trio of the best sites, take
the three above in consideration
with Digg, Stumbleupon and the
true king: Wikipedia. These three
are examples of Web 2.0—sites
that thrive on interconnectivity,
information sharing, and user
generated content.

Digg collates the most inter-
esting and newsworthy articles
as voted upon by the site’s users.
Thriving on the interconnectivity
of Web 2.0, users “digg” articles
from around the web, and the
articles with the most diggs get
face time on the dz'gg.com front
page.

Stumbleupon works as a
more concise, directed version
of digg-—users select their in-
terests, click “stumble” and are
serendipitously directed to pages
that interest them. For example,
since I selected satire as an in-
terest, I stumbled upon a blog
post about “Customer Service
Calls to God.” Stumbleupon
also allows users to “like” cer-
tain pages and share them with
friends via Facebook, email, etc.
Hours upon hours can be wasted
on both Digg and Stumbleupon,
but neither can match the true
procrastinating powers of Wiki-

pedia.

Go to Wikipedia, right now, I
dare you. Click on a random link.
Read that page. Click a link on
that page to another Wikipedia
article. Repeat. Great, see you in
an hour.

Wikipedia has the power to
suck out the productivity of the
most productive men on the plan-
et. Wikipedia has such a mass of
information that any literate per-
son is bound to ﬁnd something
that interests them, which is why
in my procrastination expertise,
can I call Wikipedia the true king
of procrastination.

Now, if you ﬁnd yourself in
the unfortunate Sunday night
paper situation, follow my ad-
vice: just relax a little, boot up
your favorite Internet browser
and run wild. The Internet is to
some a time-sink, and to others a
boundless source of knowledge,
media and social interaction. If
you can’t tell, I follow the latter
philosophy.

If anything, procrastination
has expanded my mind and im-
proved my life, which is more I
can say for my last few Sunday
night papers.

Little concern for human rights

Obama administration has a long way to go to fulﬁll human rights promises

By Abel Delgado
c 0 Lu M N I s T

What did November 9th
mean to you?

To me, it meant the com-
memoration of the day the Ber-
lin Wall came crashing down at
the hands of a people yearning to
be reunited. It meant the proof of
democracy over Communism, of
human rights over oppression, of
the rights of the people over the
will of the state.

It also marked the further vin-
dication of great men like Ronald
Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev.
Together, they brought about the
circumstances that allowed for
the destruction of that horriﬁc
physical and symbolic wall that
long separated families and still
separates mine. November 9th
means so much to me that I have
piece of that wall, marking the
date the world changed, on my
desk. «
Apparently, it does not mean
nearly as much to President
Obama, our Nobel Peace Prize-
winning leader of the free world.
He gladly stopped by the city. of

Berlin, Germany to campaign
for president in front of people
who couldn’t even vote, but not
to honor the twentieth anniver-
sary of one of the most singular-
ly deﬁning global events of the
twentieth century.

We should not be terribly sur-
prised.

Wall Street Journal Foreign
Correspondent Bret Stephens re-
cently took President Obama to
task for this decision and for the
Obama Administration’s utterly
disheartening record on human
rights issues.

One would assume President
Obama would be tea buddies
with the Dalai Lama. Wrong.
The President has refused to
meet with the digniﬁed defender
of Tibet.

One would assume President
Obama would at least attempt
to follow his campaign rheto-
ric in regards to the genocidal
government of Sudan of apply-
ing pressure. Wrong. Darfurian
rights activists must be asking

themselves, “What pressure?”
Washington and Lee students
who attended “Showcase for Su-
dan” already have shown more
concern for Sudanese refugees
than Obama’s top administration
members.

One would assume the so-
cial network-loving Obama staff
would be ﬁlled with glee over
what happened in Iran this sum-
mer. /If they were, they sure did
an excellent job of hiding it.

One would assume a presi-
dent who spoke so forcefully of
applying the will of the Ameri-
can people would not forget the
will of the Russian, Cuban and
Chinese citizens who are be-
ing murdered and tortured at
the hands of government thugs.
Wrong.

The Obama administration_

would not want silly things, like
human dignity to get in the way
of China bankrolling the farce
of an economic recovery. They
could care less about those who
get tortured 90 miles away. Fur-

‘ 'cowardice—to

thermore, Obama’s team does not
seem to think what Russia does
with its people and its neighbors
is any of our business.

But the administration’s be-
lief that human rights concerns
get in the way of solving other
problems is most troubling.

In his article, Stephens wrote,
“It also takes a remarkable de-
gree of cynicism—or perhaps
treat human
rights as something that ‘inter-
feres’ with America’s purposes
in the world, rather than as the
very thing that ought to deﬁne
them.”

Maybe it’s a good thing
President Obama did not tarnish
Berlin with a hypocritical visit.
Maybe he simply realized he
didn’t belong there.

Maybe we should start ex-
pecting more concern for human
rights issues out of not just Pres-
ident Obama, but everyone who
serves our country.

Environmental policy hurts the poor

Washington and Lee is project of environmental sustanabilizy is
hurting the more disadvantaged students on campus

By Dane Davls
COLUMNIST

In the beginning of this year,
a new policy was announced in
order to further our campus goal
of decreased carbon emissions
and increased environmental sus-
tainability. The temperature lev-
els of all campus buildings were
changed.

In the summer, buildings are
now not allowed to get cooler than
74 degrees Fahrenheit. Likewise,
in the winter the thermostat can-
not be raised to any temperature
higher than 68 degrees. By keep-
ing buildings cool in the winter
and wann in the summer, it was
thought that energy consumption
would decrease, having the twin
effects of lowering costs incurred
by the school and decreasing car-
bon emissions.

I do not doubt that this policy
will accomplish both of the stat-
ed goals. Nor do I doubt the good
intentions of those who made this
policy change.

However, I do contest the val-
ue of said policy considering cur-
rent economic conditions and its
effect upon the poor. Allow me to
explain. , . ,.

It is quite clear that the Amer-
ican economy is in a period of
recession, resulting in stagnant
wages and high unemployment
levels. During this time, the most
disadvantaged among us suffer
the greatest, as they face higher
levels of job insecurity in addi-

tion to lower levels of income. It _

is during times like these that our
vigilance for the poor, so nobly
displayed by our record of vol-
unteering in the Campus Kitchen
program and the Shepherd Pov-
erty Program, which must be at
its highest. Winter is especially
difficult for the working poor, as
they must spend high portions of
their incomes on heating bills.
Now, it is a brutal but nec-
essary truth that some of our

students come from such condi-
tions. Although I count myself
among the fortunate, not all are.
As such, in order to maintain the
same levels of comfort as before
the temperature switch, students
must purchase more sweaters,
scarves and other articles of win-
ter clothing.

While richer students can eas-
ily afford these new purchases,
poorer students may be forced to
choose between staying warm or
some other necessary purchase.

Reducing costs is a noble
goal, but there are other areas

that our university could begin.

cutting costs before they mandate
temperature reductions.

Observe how much the univer-
sity spends on landscaping alone.
Take for instance the sodding
of the grass by the Elrod Com-
mons before Parent’s Weekend.
Was this really necessary? What
of the Git-Er-Done campaign by

the registrar that was rumored to

cost around $10,000 for licensing

fees? Again, is this necessary?
While this issue may seem

" trivial, it is not. The university is

in effect cost shiﬁing the price of
heating onto students. As a result,
students have noticed the colder
classrooms. One can only esti-
mate as to what effect this will
have on classroom performance.
Can we really expect students to
be engaged in class while their
minds are focused on keeping

, warm?

Before winter gets any colder,
the university should end its pol-
icy of keeping the heater down
during winter. If the university
believes in both the necessity and
wisdom of its policy, it should
seek student ratiﬁcation and pop-
ular consent in some form.

You know it’s not easy be-
ing a dangerous and. innovative
writer.

Sometimes you have to take
risks, even when you know peo-

V ple are going to get mad at you
- about what you write. But you

A going to tell you, even though

I don’t care who I piss off, that
High Deﬁnition television is re-
ally, really good.

I realize that you are probably
shaking your head right now, and
you might be drafting a strongly

- worded letter to President Rus-

. cio, but just hear me out. High

Deﬁnition television is so good
by now that it is detrimental to
your life not to have it. Seriously.
I would say that this is the great-
est invention since sliced bread,
but sliced bread seems to pale in
comparison to High Deﬁnition.
Let’s start with sports. After
High Deﬁnition enters your life,
sports themselves are no longer

the same.

Sundays are no longer work
days that are used to get over
hangovers. Instead, your hang-
over is now coddled with foot-
ball. No longer are you left won-
dering if that guy in the middle
of the ﬁeld is the referee or just

signiﬁcantly improved by the
advent of High Deﬁnition televi-

tell whether the -Hopkins attack-
man has an appropriate amount
of lettuce ﬂowing from the back
of his helmet. Baseball fans can
now tell which of their favorite

consist of “wondering whether

that doesn’t involve bankruptcy.

Hell, even watching golf in High
Deﬁnition is almost as fun as it is
to play. Almost. You still might
need a Red Bull or three to get
through the back nine.‘

Movies are now made all
that much better thanks to High
Deﬁnition. This past week, my
roommate bought “Transformers
2” on Blu-Ray, which is the High
Deﬁnition form of DVD. Since I
am an East Coast elitist liberal,
I initially scoffed at his choice
in movie selection. I berated
him with jokes about Michael
Bay’s directing ability, which
is atrocious. However, after we
watched the movie, I was speech-
less. Was it as poorly made as I
always thought? Of course. But
thanks to Blu-Ray, I was able to
be placed right in the action as I
desperately ogled at Megan Fox
and saw giant machines tear each
other to pieces.

Girls, please take this High
Deﬁnition and Blu-Ray advice to
heart. It can come through in the
clutch, especially when you most

need it. Tired of having to sit
through your boyfriends’ “Lord
of the Rings” marathons while
he can’t get through ﬁve min-
utes of “Love Actually?” Well,
High Deﬁnition and Blu-Ray can
come to your rescue. You can
now invite any guy over, and I
guarantee that they will be able
to make it all the way through
“Failure to Launch” without
complaining once. As long as the
move is a Blu-Ray, the guy will
be so enthralled with the detail
of the landscape, that he will be
able to look past Sarah Jessica
Parker’s insufferable acting job.
You will be able to enjoy many
chick ﬂicks and maybe even a
“Sex and the City” marathon if
you simply make that minor in-
vestment in some kind of High
Deﬁnition.

High Deﬁnition has now be-
come fully a part of my life, and
if you just give it some time, it
will be fully a part of yours as
well. High Deﬁnition is to the
eyes what heroin is to the veins.

After one week of High Deﬁni-
tion, you will no longer be able
to watch cartoon shows in peace.
Seeing Cartman or Peter Grif-
ﬁn in High Deﬁnition is a com-
pletelydifferent experience from
watching them in standard deﬁ-
nition. Don’t believe me? Every
channel has made the expensive
switch to High Deﬁnition pro-
gramming because it is that prof-
itable. Even channels like Nick-
elodeon and Comedy Central are
doing this. Get the hint yet?

Look, I know that High Deﬁ-
nition doesn’t seem like it is that
much a necessity in your life. I
guess you need certain amenities
like food, water and education,
but this is High Deﬁnition we’re
talking about. You can always
beg for food and go to public
libraries. You can’t replace the
feeling of adding High Deﬁni-
tion to your life.

When we’re growing up, we

no one ever really tells us what

As we move through our lives,
changes take place. We get hurt,

_, we make good and bad decisions,

toiheetilaor

 

we hang with the “right crowd”
or the “wrong” one. Our parents
may or may not push us toward
academic or athletic success, and
we siﬁ our way through college
applications. And'jthen suddenly,
somewhere between sophomore
and junior yearfswe realize that
life is headed ourtway.

Maybe we change majors,
maybe we transfer schools. May-
be we stumble through a few
relationships before we realize
that soon we have to go out in
the world, make money, pay bills
and be adults. It’s a little scary to
think about because in front of us
looms so much possibility.

When we were young and so
sure of ourselves, it was easy to
think that everything would just
fall into place. Now, however,
we see that our choices really do
have consequences, and that tak-
ing one path leads us away from
others we thought we would
travel.

This is frightening because
there is so much to be had in front
of us, and at the same time, the

window of our childhood imagi-
nation, that universe of possibil-
ity, is slowly closing behind us.

The worst part is that we
are stuck, at this age and in this
era, between a desperate need
to prove ourselves and an over-
whelming desire not to let go of
the imagination we had when we
were younger.

When I applied to W&L, my
essay question asked, “What is
the best advice you’ve ever been
given?” I had to think about it for
a while, but the only answer that
ﬁt was one from my insane AP
English teacher ﬁom senior year
of high school. He simply said to
us, “Be passionate.” Whatever
you do, wherever you go, be pas-
sionate about the jobs you take,
the skills you cultivate and the
people you have in your life.

If I have learned anything
over my time here, it’s that with-
out the drive to succeed at some-
thing, you absolutely will not
ﬁnd success. Furthermore, you’ll
likely be pretty miserable in the
process, even if you’re one of

those people who can suck it up
and do work you don’t like, and
even those are rarities.

My best friend from home had
a baby this year and, somehow,
more power to her, she’s making
it work. She’s making it work as
a waitress and a line-cook. In a
situation that would send most

every sense of the word, I look at
my own fancy education and de-
pendent status, and wonder who
is truly more successful. She may
not be following the Disney fairy
tale template, but she’s vibrant,

good if the bad weren’t around.
Without passion, our motions
will be mechanical and our words
powerless. We have a right to life
and all that it entails.

I know that I’m not the only one, I
hope that other women can read this and
realize that they’re not alone either. Ev-
ery now and then, when I get stressed
about school, sports or anything else,
this memory just keeps ﬁnding its way
back out. I’ve seen counselors, I’ve had
amazing friends, all of whom would
drop (and have dropped) anything to
comfort me.

I took a vacation to Montreal after
my senior year with my best friend from
high school, Beth, and we were planning
on spending some time with a mutual
friend’s brother. He joined us within 30
minutes of arriving at the hotel, which
I felt was a bit soon considering we
hadn’t even had a chance to look around
for ourselves yet. When I opened the ho-
tel room door, I discovered John, as well
as a second guy—Beth had asked John
to bring a “guy for her friend”.

We started pre gaming—having

‘some shots, beers and jagerbombs.

John’s friend, Graham, and I were just
having normal conversations, me teas-
ing him for being Canadian and so on.
I don’t think that I had more  

' drinks, but then again, I‘co1ildn’t7h(§l(¥

my liquor as well as I can now. So at the

" time, I didn’t suspect that anything was

going to happen.
Then, a few of the friends, Graham
included, went into Graham’s room to

smoke pot. He asked if I wanted to come,
and I said sure, but that I didn’t smoke
pot, which didn’t seem to be a problem
with him. In his room, I ended up taking
a hit for the ﬁrst time in my life. Shortly
afterwards, things started fading out.

My next memory is one that I will
never forget. I woke up naked with him
having sex with me. I was in a lot of
pain, and all I could say was “don’t.”

He either took that as “don’t stop”
or he chose to completely disregard my
comment, because he didn’t stop. He
asked if "I “liked that,” and I said no.
He then said, “That’s because it’s not in
your ass,” and he proceeded to switch
holes. At this point, I somehow found
the strength to throw him off of me, but
he just got right back and continued hav-
ing vaginal intercourse with me. Then I
blacked out again.

I woke up in the morning with his
arms around me.. We were both naked.
I‘ started  He asked if I was cold
and all I could think to say was “sort of.”
I then found a bathrobe on the ﬂoor, put
it on, and left the room. I went upstairs

munity: If the only thing you remember

change my past. I can only build on my
own experience. But an important point
to note is that my life has changed dra-
matically since this. I have yet to have
sex since. While I have DFM’ed (Dance
Floor Makeout, for all of the freshmen),
the idea of intercourse still scares me.

I was not a virgin when this happened,
but I’m still afraid that my next time will
bring up this memory.

Also, LOOK OUT FOR EACH
OTHER. I couldn’t believe that my best
friend just deserted me, and I was horri-
ﬁed to discover that she had witnessed
it——while sober——even when I had pre-
viously mentioned that I did not want
to have sex that night. Please, please,
PLEASE do not let this happen to any
girl. If you know that she does not want
to hook up with anyone, stop it from
happening, even if she’s not your best
friend.

If this has happened to you, please
know that you’re not alone. And wheth-
er or not this has happened, please
avoid from using the R word, even in a
ﬁiendly context. “We raped them in that
volleyball/basketball/soccer game” can
hit home for a lot more people than you
think——and you only notice when you
know that one of the victims is standing

Momix shows innovation in dance

Worla'—renownea' dance group performs at W&L, teaches master class on the soul, joy of dancing from the heart

By Flndley Merrltt and Tory Kate Dlckerson

STAFF WRITERS

This past week, Washington
and Lee University was fortu-
nate enough to host the intema—
tionally-renowned dance group,
Momix, for a performance and
dance master class.

Momix is known for its imag-
inative illusions and surrealist
style. By using lights, props,
sculptures and puppets, to ‘name
just a few tricks, dancers send the
audience through a mind trip of
beautiful dancing and imagery.

The group is made up of
dancers from the likes of the
Tisch School of the Arts and The
Juilliard School and will be trav-

elling to Egypt for the next leg of
their tour.
Momix performed on

Wednesday night to a packed
house——the show was delayed
several minutes to ensure every-
one had a seat.

As a hush ﬁnally fell over the
crowd, the lights dimmed, and a
starry sky blanketed the stage as
an enormous glowing blue pup-
pet came out to send the audi-
ence oﬁ’ on its surreal journey.

The show was breathtaking,
and the audience could barely
contain itself as the stereotypi-
cal “ooh’s” and “ahh’s” slipped
from nearly everyone’s lips. The

group’s famous illusions pushed
the boundaries and limits of
imagination.

In one particular number, sev-
eral of the dancers donned white,
long sleeved shirts and stood
against a black backdrop. The
lighting effects allowed only the
sleeves to be seen and it looked
like a ﬂock of ﬂying birds. As the
dancers moved, they formed oth-
er shapes, and at one point even
mimicked moving lips,

Despite the astounding vi-
sual effects Momix is known
for, perhaps the most impressive
part of the show was the dancers’
strength, agility, technical skill
and work with props.

The third number into the
show, entitled “Tuu,” was a duet
with a man and a woman and no
props or i1lusions—just dancing.
Both dancers exhibited incred-
ible strength without sacriﬁcing
ﬂexibility. .

The man, Sam Beckman,
lifted dancer Rebecca Rasmus-
sen with ease. This number ex-
perimented with the symmetry
of two human bodies and weight
distribution. .

Another duet came later in the
show and incorporated a giant
metallic, curved statue. Beck-

Sculptures: I can’t
believe it IS butter!

Simpson presents a dozen years ’worth
of research on art of butter sculptures

Sculptures aren’t just marble
and bronze. In fact, they can even
be made of butter.

Art History Professor Pamela
Simpson presented her more
than 12 years of research in the

Simpson has seen sculptures
that have lasted anywhere from
two weeks to up to eight months

and says that the lasting time-

art of butter sculpting to students
on Wednesday, including quotes
from a paper she wrote and im-
ages of various sculptures that she
has seen. '

While she has never done a
sculpture, Simpson appreciates
the art form.

She believes that butter sculp-
tures are intriguing because they
are made out of food. While peo-
ple do not eat the sculpture, it is
consumed mentally because it is
made out of a common foodstuff.

She says that in order to sculpt
with this medium, one has to
use a metal or wooden armature
to provide a base. Once the but-
ter is wrapped around the device
it needs to stay refrigerated for
many days to ensure that it will

eration. Also, regular butter is the
preferred medium, not margarine
because it is too sticky.

Senior Jane ‘Bouch attended the.

presentation and found Simpson’s
research to be very interesting.
“The size of some of the sculp-

_ tures was unreal. Most of the im-

ages that she showed were life-
size and very intricate,” Bouch
said.
Butter sculptures originated
.as centerpiece displays during
the Renaissance. The art medium
transformed into an advertising
technique for dairy farms in the
19th century and also represent-
ed an aspect of President Teddy
Roosevelt’s tenure in ofﬁce.
While an unusual art form, it is
something that is intriguing, inter-

man, along with dancer Natalie
Lomonte, rolled the enormous
statue along the stage while hold-

by teaching a master class on
Tuesday.
Simerson taught the class,

company after his previous po-
sition with Eric Hawkins Dance
Company.

“I’d rather teach a class on performance rather than technique. It

gets people out of their safety zones . . . I push them until something

not so choreographed comes out. Then you see individual personali-

ing on to it, thus being hoisted up
in the air giving the illusion of
ﬂying and suspension. The man-

uever, despite the bulky statue,‘

was both powerful and beautiful
to watch. _
Despite Momix’s awe—in-

spiring effects, the talent of the.

dancers cannot be mistaken for
an illusion. The ﬁnale gave each
dancer a short solo in the spot-
light to exhibit her personality
and talent. Even with the lack
of bright lights and nifty props,
it was one of the most incredible
pieces in the show.

While at W&L, member
Brian Simerson volunteered to
work with W&L dance students

emphasizing high energy, natu- I

ral movement and presentation
rather than perfection.

“I’d rather teach a class on
performance than on technique,”
said Simerson. “It gets people
out of their safety zones.”

The Virginia native has been
with Momix Dance Company
for 16 years, teaching classes
and performing as a soloist in the
company.

Under the directorship of
Moses Pendleton, Momix Dance
Company is known for present-
ing innovative work with excep-
tional physical beauty.

That illusionary element is
what attracted Simerson to the

Simerson ﬁrst asked each
student to introduce themselves,
and then later he made them indi-
vidually walk across the stage.

From just those two exercis-
es, Simerson announced that he
had interpreted each individual
‘s personality.

He used this exercise to show

9 that presentation is everything,

and taking big risks can make
someone more comfortable in
how she presents herself.

During the class, Simerson
encouraged students to explore
their movements so that their
movements became bigger and
bolder.

He did this by making each

student improvise for a minute
with different music.

Toward the end of the class,
Simerson let students experi-
ment with some of the Momix
performance props. ~

He let students bounce around
on long poles and swing from a
metal prop that worked similar to
aseesaw.

Simerson said that he just
wanted to see students having
fun.

“He simply captured that joy
of dancing,” said sophomore
Kali McFarland.

Simerson’s regular classes
are similar to the master class he
taught.

With the exception of props,
his regular classes have compo-
nents of yoga, improvisation,
technique and performance.

Simerson said that he wants
dancers to walk away feeling
more comfortable with them-
selves and with more insight into
who they really are.

“I push them until something
not so choreographed comes
out,” he said. “Then you see in-
dividual personalities.”

Lady Generals boast young team

With only one returning senior: the Lady Generals will look to use their young players to make a dent in the ODAC Conference

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

In most cases, the only purpose of
preseason athletic polls is to provide
bulletin board material for the teams
involved. If a team is picked to ﬁnish
ﬁrst, then the coach will usually brush it
off and make sure the players don’t get
inﬂated egos and assume the title will
just be handed to them. For all those

- teams not picked ﬁrst, the poll becomes

motivation to prove it wrong. The Wash-
ington and Lee University women’s
basketball team will fall into the latter
category, as they were picked to ﬁnish
sixth in the eleven-team Old Dominion
Athletic Conference.

Head coach Mandy King is entering
her seventh season at the helm for the

Generals. She is the program’s all-time

wins leader with 72 victories. She will_

be assisted on the bench by second-year
coach Abby Pyzik.

The pair led the Generals to a very
respectable year last season. The team
ﬁnished with a middling record of 14-
12, but hidden in that record are thir-
teen regular season conference wins, a
school record. The team went 9-3 down
the stretch last year, but unfortunately
was bounced in the ﬁrst round of the
conference tournament in a heartbreaker
to Bridgewater College. The team looks
to reverse its playoff fortunes this year.
And with a strong returning cast, that
goal is deﬁnitely within reach.

The 2009-10 Generals will ﬁeld
an extremely young team. With only
one senior, Kaitlyn Kamp, eight of the
eleven players are ﬁrst-years and sopho-
mores. In that young group are the Gen-
erals’ top three scorers from last year.
Sophomores Becca Bolton and Meg In-
gram are both back, as is Junior center
Felice Herman.

All three posted some gaudy statis-
tics last year. Ingram led the team with
15.5 points per game as an everyday
starter. She quickly became known as
a long range assassin, setting a school
record for three point ﬁeld goals in a

. season (79) and ﬁnished eleventh in the

nation in three pointers per game (2.9).

She garnered Second Team All-ODAC
honors and was named rookie of the
year for the ODAC, Virginia College
Division, and South Region. Her game
will not take anybody by surprise this
year as she can expect many defenses to
key in on her.

Bolton and Herman were second and
third on the team in scoring, averaging
12.4 and 10.2 points her game respec-
tively. More impressively, and perhaps
more importantly, they both averaged
over seven rebounds a game and were
high percentage shooters. Coach King
will count on these three to again lead
the Generals. With another year of ex-
perience under their belts, expectations

will be even higher after a successful
year last season.

The road will not be easy. Roanoke
College was only missing one vote to
become the unanimous No. 1 ranked
team in the preseason poll. The team is
a perennial powerhouse and was joined
at the top of the rankings by Randolph-
Macon, Eastern Mennonite, Bridgewa-
ter, and Virginia Wesleyan. All should
be tough opponents.

There is no denying the Generals
have the talent to compete and succeed
in the ODAC this year. The question will
be if youth can prevail. The women’s
ﬁrst match-up is Nov. 17 against Mary
Washington. ‘

2-1 victory in the ODAC Tournament
two weeks ago. This time, however,
Lynchburg took control early and got
their revenge.

Senior midﬁelder Shelley Hoath
slipped through the Generals’ vaunted
defense midway through the ﬁrst half,
collecting a pass and turning it into her
team-leading 12th goal of the season.
Her sister, Ashley Hoath, put to rest any
comeback hopes when her 63rd min-
ute comer kick deﬂected off of the post

and into the net. The 2-0 lead was more
than enough for the Lynchburg defense,
which held strong and limited the Gen-
erals to just two shots on goal.

It was a disappointing ending to an
impressive season for W&L. The team
came into the tournament ranked 10th
in the nation and ﬁrst in the South re-
gion. After ﬁnishing the regular season
14-1-3 (9-0-2 in the ODAC), the Gen-
erals rolled through the ODAC tourney.

A penalty-kick victory over Virginia
Wesleyan sealed their ﬁrst conference
championship since 2006 and earned
them an automatic NCAA _bid.

Facing Christopher Newport in the
ﬁrst round, the Generals erupted for four
second half goals, including two off of
corner kicks by senior midﬁelder Mag-
gie Sutherland.

“We came out ﬂying,” Sutherland
said. “It’s not always clean, but we were
taught to crash the box.”

W&L outshot Christopher Newport
9-1 in the ﬁrst half, but couldn’t exploit
the advantage.

“We just weren’t_ putting the ball
away,” Sutherland said. “We talked [at
halftime] about having a killer instinct.”

The Generals came out of the break
playing inspired soccer, pressuring

CNU’s defense into turnovers and ﬁn-

ishing set piece opportunities. After
Sutherland gave W&L a 2-0 lead, ﬁrst-
year midﬁelder Ainsley Daigle convert-
ed a penalty kick 10 minutes later to seal
it. First-year midﬁelder Katie ‘Howard
capped the scoring in the 89th minute
with her sixth goal of the season.

As Sutherland was subbed out, the
senior captain received a warm ovation
from the crowd, and the celebration was
on.

“Every game is our last,” she said.

  

“That’s how we’re playing it. It means
everything.”

Unfortunately for Sutherland and
fellow senior Roz Klann, their college
careers would come to an end the next
day. The loss marks the second consecu-
tive year Lynchburg has ended W&L’s
season. The Hornets won 1-0 last year to
eliminate the Generals from the ODAC
Tournament.

Sutherland ﬁnished with 15 goals
over her four years. A four-year starter,
she played both defense and midﬁeld,
winning ODAC Rookie of the Year and
being named to the All-ODAC First
Team twice.

Klann also started for four years and,
with Sutherland, steered W&L’s record-
setting defense. She notched 20 goals
and won All-ODAC accolades in 2007
and ’08.

 

The NCAA tournament berth was
W&L’s ﬁrst since 2006. The team will
return nine of 11 starters next year, in-

cluding leading scorers sophomore Allie _

Espina and Daigle. Sophomore keeper
and ODAC Player of the Year Emily
Leary will also be back in 2010.

Students call on W&L community to contribute ideas on new policies and ideas to help end sexual assault on campus

By Eric Gehman
smrr warren

The Women’s and Gender

Studies department is holding‘

an open forum on sexual as-
sault policy reform this coming
Wednesday at 7:15 p.m. as part
of a project for WGS296A, the
Sexual Assault Prevention Work-
shop. They have also started a
new student group on campus
called END IT. which seeks to
end sexual assault at Washington
and Lee over the next 20 years.

Professor Melina Bell, who
developed the course with se-
nior Emily Coyle over last sum-
mer, said that the purpose of the
WGS296A course is to “not only
study the problem” of sexual as-
sault policy at W&L, but to “ﬁnd
some solutions and start a con-
versation about implementing
[them].”

Students are preparing for the
forum by studying “academic lit-
erature... addressing how, why,
and under what circumstances
rape and sexual assault occur,"
as well as surveys and studies
conducted locally by former and
current W&L undergrads about
the prevalence of sexual assault
within the W&L community.

Other members of the com-
munity, such as Project Horizon
director Judy Casteele, univer-
sity counselor Jennifer Sayre,
Dean of Students Dawn Wat-
kins, Sergeant Miles Kelly of the

Rockbridge County Sherriff’s
Ofﬁce and more visited the class
throughout the semester to help
the students gain a better un-
derstanding of the problem on
campus as they put together their
own ideas and opinions about
reforming policy and changing
culture at W&L.

Dr. Bell hopes that the fo-
rum can “provide information
about the nature and prevalence
of sexual assault  on college
campuses, and at W&L in par-
ticular.”

Her students will present dif-
ferent proposals to reform school
policy for sexual assault with
the hope that those in attendance
will offer their own opinions and
suggestions as part of an ongoing
dialogue within the community
about how to end sexual assault
at W&L.

Bell wants “to get some
good ideas from the commu-
nity... about how to_improve or
implement [policy recommenda-
tions].” The group also hopes to
“raise awareness... and connect
with supporters who might be
able to work with them as they
work to end sexual assault at
W&L,” according to Bell.

The class has already met
with the Student Faculty Hearing
Board Ad-Hoc Review commit-
tee and discussed ways to im-

prove the adjudication of sexual
assault at W&L, but Bell noted
that the forum will be the ﬁrst
time the class presents a uni-
ﬁed set of proposals for both the
SFHB and the administration.
She hopes to submit the class’s
proposals to the Student Affairs
Committee once the class has re-
ceived some feedback and input

strategies, which is incredibly
energizing.” Coyle herself pro-
posed that the course be offered
this year, and described herself
as “thrilled” that other students
signed up to join her cause.

The class, comprised of all fe-
male students, has members from
all 6 NPC sororities, two athletic
teams, the Captains Council,

merit for sexual assault preven-
tion and policy reform.

As a part of the class, a rep-
resentative from the national
organization Students Active for
Ending Rape (SAFER) visited
campus and hosted a training
seminar on political action and
sexual assault prevention on col-
lege campuses.

“We ’re on the brink ofdiscussing concrete prevention strategies,

. which is incredibly energizing. ...It is only with broad community

support that we have "any chance of changing the prevalence of

sexual assualt here. ’

EMILY COYLE, senior

from the community forum.

Coyle urged the importance
of “spreading the dialogue [about
sexual assault] to all demograph-
ics at Washington and Lee.”

“Sexual assault isn’t simply
a women’s issue,” she said, “and
this will take a community-wide
effort [to put an end to sexual as-
sault on campus.]”

Coyle called the class “a lot
of work, but very rewarding” and
believes that “we’re on the brink

and more; the group represents a
wide variety of majors and many
other campus organizations.
Both Bell and Coyle felt that
while the class represented a
broad range of interests academi-
cally, politically and socially, the
lack _of male perspective caused
some difﬁculties as they work to
incorporate men into the move-

Other members from the
W&L community were invited
as well and the group decided
to coalesce into an organization
known as END IT. to continue
their efforts after the semester
ends.

Regarding the role of END IT.
in next week’s forum, Coyle said
that “it will come up, and we’ll
certainly pass around a sign-
up sheet for those interested in
getting involve. However, what
we’re presenting is really what

the class has found. At this point,
END IT. is an entity in itself and
I’d hate to represent what the
class is doing as the thoughts and
feelings of the whole organiza-
tion.”

Coyle said that the new group
is seeking to “extend member-
ship, especially among first
years, faculty and staff and male

students,” and “start to work

with other groups on campus
who might share similar inter-
ests in preventing sexual assault
at W&L.” She stressed, “it is
only with broad community sup-

port that we have any chance of

changing the prevalence of sexu-
al assault here.”

Calling in and speaking out

Student organizations team up to call representatives and voice opinions for (or against) contested Stupak amendment

By Eric Gehman
STAFF warren

A group of students orga-
nized by Voices for Choice, the
College Democrats and KEWL
spent their past Wednesday eve-
ning calling local representatives
to protest the hotly debated Stu-
pak Amendment to congressio-
nal healthcare reform.

The amendment, put forth by
Rep. Bart Stupak (D-MI) and
Rep. Joseph Pitts (R-PA), would
restrict the so-called “Public Op-
tion” government run-healthcare
program from covering abortion
procedures except in the case
of rape, incest, or danger to the
mother’s life. Plans purchased on
the healthcare “exchange” with
federal subsidies would also be
restricted from including cover-
age for elective abortion proce-
dures.

Democrats and pro-choice op-
ponents of the amendment point
out that while it would only le-
gally limit those who buy health
exchange on the federally sub-

sidized healthcare exchange or
those who elect to receive direct
coverage from the federal gov-
ernment, the economic repercus-
sions- of such a restriction would
cause private healthcare insur-
ers to drop coverage for elective
abortions as well, limiting wom-
en’s options for reproductive
choice through economic chan-
nels rather than legal channels.

Voices for Choice President
sophomore Hallie Janson said
she felt it “necessary that people
on campus get involved with
politics because we live in such
an insulated environment.”

She also had concerns that
this legislation went beyond a
simple disagreement in morality,
but rather that it “limits and leg-
islates women’s bodies.”

For her organization, the call-
in was a chance to promote a pro-
choice cause on campus and help
effect change at the federal level
for an issue her group members

are passionate about.

A recent George Washington
University study concluded that
“...the terms and impact of the
Amendment will work to defeat
the development of a supplemen-
tal coverage market for medical-
ly indicated abortions.”

The study also notes that “. ..
the House legislation contains
no direct economic incentive to
create such a market... because
supplemental coverage must
of necessity commingle funds
with basic coverage, the impact
of Stupak/Pitts on states’ abil-
ity to offer supplemental Medie-
aid coverage to women insured
through a subsidized exchange
plan is in doubt.”

Yet proponents of the amend-
ment argue that it merely seeks
to preserve the status quo with
respect to the usage of federal
funding for elective abortion pro-
cedures. The Hyde Amendment,
the current legislation barring the

use of Medicaid funding for elec-
tive abortion procedures, was the
template for the Stupak amend-
ment, according to its creator.
Representative Stupak sought to
maintain the government’s cur-
rent policy without allowing for
any new abortion legislation to
become a part of the healthcare
reform bill.

Students For Life president
senior Sarah Keckler comment-
ed on the call-in, expressing her
concern over the wording of or-
ganizer senior Summer Sterling’s
campus notice. According to Ke-
ckler, Sterling’s notice read that
“private insurance companies
would be prohibited from fund-
ing abortions.”

“That is not the case,” Keckler

said. “The amendment does not
prohibit funding. In fact if you
read it, you will ﬁnd that it em-
phasizes about ﬁve to six times
that [prohibiting private funding]
is what it’s not going to do.”

Keckler also expressed con-
cern over the unawareness that
surrounds the Stupak bill, citing
that she had trouble ﬁnding the
actual amendment online. How-
ever, Keckler mentioned that
Students For Life have plans in
the works for supporting aware-
ness and the bill itself.

“We would like to do a cam-
paign increasing the awareness
of the campaign,” she said. “The
problem is timing, though. We’d
like to do something in January,
seeing as that is a month that is a
big month for pro-life organiza-
tions, with events like March for
Life, etc. We just have to see ifit
will be relevant enough by then,
seeing as it’s backed-up in Con-
gress at the moment.”

Sterling, other members of
KEWL and members of the Col-
lege Democrats were unavailable
for interviewing.

Gift ideas that woﬂf get you in trouﬁe

Struggling to think of the perfect gift to buy your cherished ones?

By Stockton Bullltt
OPINIONS EDITOR

The holiday season is already
upon us. Christmas Weekend is
already over, the Lexington holi-
day parade is next week and ﬁnals
start right after that.

Now, while you are most like-
ly spending most of your time left
at Washington and Lee studying
your brains out and worrying how
many points exactly it will take
for you to reach a passing grade
for each of your classes, you need
to remember that with the holiday
season comes presents, and now
that you’re an adult, you actually
have to buy some presents your-
self.

After doing some “intense
research” (otherwise known as
browsing the intemet during the
SEC Championship Game), I have
discovered all the perfect gifts for
each treasured person in your life.
But hey, maybe you don’t like my
idea for a gift, so I’ve also thrown
in what not to buy for each trea-
sured person in your life.

Why do I do this? Well, you’d
be surprised at the mistakes some
people make with their choices in
Christmas gifts. Nothing is more
awkward than seeing your mom
unwrap the Victoria’s Secret San-
ta lingerie while the whole family
watches. Trust me.

So, without further ado, here is
what to get and what not to get for
each person you might possibly
buy presents for:

Dad- The best gift a child can
give their father is a gift that si-
multaneously makes your dad feel
more like a man and beneﬁts your
life in some way. Using this meth-
od, the perfect gift for your dad
this Christmas is the Big Green
Egg. The Big Green Egg is a kind
of charcoal grill that was original-
ly used in ancient Japan and more
or less makes the perfect man
grill. Plus, now your dad’s burnt
steaks won’t taste too bad. Sure,
it costs about $500 or so, but you
love your dad, right?

The sure-ﬁre gift you don’t
want to give your dad is a letter
from Dean Dotson detailing how
you recently got a strike. Nothing
really ruins the spirit of family
love on the holidays like your dad
berating you for needing to talk

back to security while you were
wasted. A letter like that is best
saved until after New Year’s.

Mom- The best way to not
only earn a little extra love from
your mom over the holidays but
also to reassure her that you are
actually doing some work in Lex-
ington is to give her a new copy
of a book that you recently read
in either your History or Eng-
lish classes. That way, you can
talk about the book like you ac-
tually know something about it,
and even if you didn’t read the
book, you can simply regurgitate
the notes that you jotted down in
class. Just tell her that you saw
this book in the bookstore, and
“it just screamed you.” This move
will buy you a good amount of
love over the holidays.

If you’re pressed for time and
desperate for a present, please
do not buy your mom the new
Eminem album, “Reﬁll,” which
is released on Dec. 21. Although
he may have inspired you by get-
ting out of 8- mile, I have a hunch
that your mother probably doesn’t
identify with his plight.

Brother- You want your broth-
er to think you’re cool, whether
he be older or younger, so why
not properly impress him with
something he deﬁnitely wants no
matter how old he is. Once he
hits puberty, the one real present
your brother wants from you pe-
rennially is alcohol. So why not
appease him and get him a nice
handle of Jack Daniels? If he’s
older than you, he’ll nod silently
in gratitude, and if he’s younger,
he’ll probably build a shrine to
you in his closet.

Conversely, your brother prob-
ably won’t think you’re very cool
if you get him “Hannah Montana:
The Movie” on Blu-ray. He es-
pecially won’t think you’re cool
if you tell him about the special
new features and awesome ‘de-
leted scenes featuring Billy Ray
Cyrus’ hilarious acting while he’s
unwrapping it.

Sister- Since I personally have
no idea what my sister likes when
it comes to gifts, my choice is a
Bath and Body Works gift certiﬁ-
cate. That way, I won’t embarrass



myself by buying her the wrong
kind of scent that all the losers
in her school apparently wear.
She tends to appreciate picking
things out herself anyway, so I’m
not going to get in the way of her
shopping capabilities. Ladies, you
might have a more speciﬁc pres-
ent in mind for your sister because
you probably have taste, but re-
member that the gift certiﬁcate is
always a good bet.

It’s never fun to unwrap a pres-
ent and see a big box of condoms,
especially if you’re family is
around. I know that you’re actual-
ly trying to give your sister a nec-
essary gift that will keep her safe,
but the nice gesture makes for an
awkward Christmas present. Even
as a stocking stuffer, giving con-
doms to your sister on Christmas
is pushing it.

Boyfriend- Now that we’ve
moved on past family members,
we can get to age appropriate
gifts. Now I know that you prob-
ably want your boyfriend to spend
more time with you, but I guaran-
tee that he will love you forever if
you get him “Call of Duty: Mod-
em Warfare II” for the Playsta-
tion 3. In fact, his utter shock and
surprise that you knew what the
“Call of Duty” video game series
is might cause a proposal right
there and then. Be forewarned.

Girlfriend- Chicks dig dia-
monds. It’s not a mystery. There
really is no substitute for the joy
that will be added to both your
lives by simply going to Zales,
manning up and giving her some
bling. It’s not exactly rocket sci-
ence.

There is no better way to ruin
Christmas than giving your girl-
friend an unexpected surprise.
Now, I know that present won’t
really be opened until around Au-
gist or so, but I’m pretty sure that
your girlfriend will not appreci-
ate thegesture and will spend the
next nine months wishing that
her brother had actually bought
her that inappropriate box of con-
doms. And you never want that...

Lacrosse Bro- You may be
hanging around the lax ﬁeld and
feel the need to give your bro
friend a present that can properly

better his bro lifestyle. Well, with
the new 2010 Duke Burn Speed
3.0 cleats, your friend can a much
faster bro. He can now live out his
bromosexuality feeling light as a
feather while he runs train on the
lacrosse ﬁeld.

Dweeb— When they’re not in
the science center, dweebs love
science ﬁction movies, so your
geek friend will no doubt appreci-
ate some 3- D “Avatar” tickets for
opening night on December '16.
This movie apparently cost around
half a billion dollars to make and
it seems like it could have the big-
gest cult following since the “Lord
of the Rings” trilogy. It might be a
little too much to buy your dweeb
friend the accompanying “Ava-
tar” costume, but you never know.
It might work better than the “Re-
venge of the Nerds” box set you
got him last year.

C-School Major- You’ll prob-
ably want to buy your friend in
the C-School something long and
time consuming to get him to stop
talking about how Obama is or is
not ruining the nation as a whole.
There is no book that will get him
to shut up faster and keep him
consumed for longer than the new
sequel to “Freakonomics,” “Su-
perFreakonomics.” Steven Levitt
and Stephen Dubner’s 288 page
follow up will last your C-School
friend at least until mid- January.

Please, under no circumstances
buy your C-School friend a copy
of the proposed health care bill
that is slowly but surely making
its way through the Senate right
now. Not only will he read this
in record time, but he will assault
you with information concerning
the problems with it. Trust me,
you do not want to hear sixteen
more hours of footnoted material
about the public option. It’ll cause
your head to explode.

On that note,HI hope that these ~ 
gift ide’as'ha've prov'idéd”you with ‘ ‘

at least some insight in what to
get your loved ones this holiday
season. Enjoy ﬁnals and the much
needed vacation!

The BCS should change from a bowl system to

p a offs
It is early December, time for Christmas trees, Menorahs, and the obligatory college football p ayo

By Jonathon Salm
COLUMNIST

As the fall semester comes
to an end at colleges across the
nation, students have a number
of things to look forward to: in-
sane amounts of studying, the
ﬁnal parties before break, and of
course, the beginning of college
football bowl games. While I, like
every true red-blooded American
male, love college football, it re-
mains an indisputable fact that
there are essential problems with
the NCAA’s Bowl Championship
Series and its bowl-centric post-
season format.

Despite the excitement and
pageantry that comes with the
conclusion of college football’s
regular season, rivalry week-
end and the ensuing conference
championship games only serve
to usher in the irrational mess
that is the bowl system. While
I am not completely against the

    

A strong

idea of bowl games, the way the
BCS handles'*marquee matchups
among the nation’s best teams is
completely illogical.

Before you start screaming,
“HE WANTS A PLAYOFF!”
and quit reading, hear me out. I
am not alone in my hatred for the
BCS system. Think back to the
years since the BCS system was
established in 1998. Each year,
there have been multiple con-
troversies that leave at least one
team crying foul.

Ok, so maybe I do want a
toumament-style playoff system,
albeit a modiﬁed one that would
allow losing teams to participate
in bowl games. Take the sixteen
highest ranked teams at the end
of November to the tournament,
and begin the ﬁrst round the ﬁrst
weekend of December. Have the
tournament run for three con-

Recapping sexual assault at W&L

Dear Phi readers,

We’ve heard you’re tired of
seeing our posters, tired of us
“beating the dead horse” when it
comes to rape and sexual assault
on campus, tired of shoving the
issue in your face.

Well, good.

We’ve spent 12 weeks im-
mersed in the issue that’s affect-
ing countless people on campus
and unfortunately, statistically,
will somehow touch your life as
well.

You’ve likely heard the sta-
tistic that W&L’s sexual assault
rate is twice the national average,
but have you really ever stopped
to think beyond those numbers?
They aren’t just percentages or

statistical numbers on a graph.

Those numbers represent real
people and a real problem on our
campus.

We are all victims of sexual
assault, whether we are the ones
who are physically violated or
we are the friends, sisters, broth-
ers, roommates and classmates
of someone who has been bro-
ken by this crime.

Injustice anywhere is a threat

' issue is crucial.

to freedom everywhere. Let’s
start working to make W&L a
safe place for everyone.

The Sexual Assault Preven-
tion workshop will be hosting a
community forum on sexual as-
sault on Wednesday at 7:15 p.m.
in Commons 345. We will be
presenting our recommendations
for altering W&L policy as well
as suggestions for other practices
relating to sexual assault.

We encourage you to see what
we have been working on, to ed-
ucate yourself on this important
campus issue and to make your
questions and opinions heard.
Voicing your own questions,
complaints, suggestions and
doubts about our sexual assault
This problem
is a campus-wide one, and the
entire W&L community must be
part of the solution.

We all have a stake in this.

Together we can. END IT.

Sincerely,

secutive weekends, leaving two
teams to face off in the champi-
onship. Those teams would then
have two weeks to prepare for the
championship game.

This year more than ever, a
college football playoff system
makes the most sense. There are
currently ﬁve undefeated teams:
Alabama, Texas, Cincinnati,
TCU, and Boise State. While the
latter three have less of a claim
to participate in the champion-
ship game than the former two, it
nevertheless takes an impressive
team to go through a season com-
pletely undefeated. On top of the
undefeated teams, there are nu-
merous quality one and two loss
teams that could give the top ﬁve
a run for their money — Florida,
Oregon and Ohio State to name
a few. A tournament is not only
the fairest way to determine the

nation’s best team, but also one
of the most exciting ones.

Under my quixotic playoff
system, bowl games would con-
tinue. The toumament’s losers
and all other teams deemed bowl
eligible (read: have a winning re-
cord) would participate in bowls.
Ideally, the four BCS bowl games
would be reestablished as “ma-
jor” bowl games, ﬁlled with the
eight highest ranked losers from
the tournament. Three more pre-
mier bowl games would host the
rest of the toumament’s losers.

Despite the obvious ingenuity
of a playoff system, BCS support-
ers nonetheless ﬁnd reasons to
criticize a playoff. One, it would
make the eventual national cham-
pions play an extra four games.
However, consider taking away
conference championship games
as well as one in-conference

game and one out-of-conference
game during the regular season.
That leaves only one extra game,
possibly two if the champion’s
conference does play a confer-
ence championship game. '

The other popular criticism of
a playoff system is not as easy to
debunk. The main problem with
the playoff system is that right
now changing the bowl structure
is currently unfeasible. Why?
The complex structure involved
with bowl sponsors, conference
tie-ins, and television coverage
makes the bowl system a lucra-
tive and proﬁtable institution.
Unfortunately, it means that we
are unlikely to see a playoff sys-
tem anytime soon.

We’re certainly getting closer.
Just this year, the Mountain West
Conference collectively proposed
an eight-team playoff, which was

debate

then quickly rejected by the BCS
presidential oversight committee.
Even politicians are getting into
it. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah)
has announced that he will likely
be suing the BCS as an anti-com-
petitive trust under the Sherman
Anti—Trust Act. The Senate is
slated to begin anti-trust hearings
on the BCS in the spring. While
I am not a fan of mixing politics
and sports (shouldn’t politicians
be ﬁxing healthcare, social se-
curity, etc?), I admire Senator
Hatch’s dedication. However, in
all likelihood, little change will
come from the government.

As for now, it seems that all
we can do is sit back and watch
what happens. And for the next
month, that means watching un-
healthy amounts of college foot-
ball. I’m alright with that.

Sexual assault problems at home

An anonymous writer tells her story of being raped by a former boyfriend

Sometimes people can con-
vince themselves that they
weren’t raped until they share
their story with others. That’s
how it was with me. I convinced
myself that being treated the
way I was treated was normal.
It’s not.

I didn’t get my ﬁrst boyfriend
until the summer before my se-
nior year of high school. I had
always felt like there must be
something wrong with me, that
no boys would take notice of me.
But he convinced me that there
wasn’t anything wrong with me,
at least for a while. He was a year
younger than me, and our rela-
tionship went steadily downhill
all that year. I was crazy about
him, though, and didn’t think
I would ever ﬁnd anything bet-
ter. He_even told me that no one
else besides him would ever care
about me the couple times I tried
to stand up for myself.

He broke up with me before
I left for college, but he contin-
ued to drain me emotionally,
always calling on me when he
“needed me” and always giv-
ing me conﬂicting answers as
to whether or not he still loved
me. I was confused and strained
by this relationship and by the
way he treated me, but every
time I came home he acted like

we were still together when we
were alone and convinced me to
engage in sexual activities with
him. I complied because I’m the
type of person who would nev-
er do something like that with
someone I didn’t care about, and
the fact that he was willing to do
it with me made me think he still
cared.

When I came back to school
after Christmas, I realized I
couldn’t handle it anymore. I was
sick of being lied to and ignored
and expected to drop everything
when he wanted me to, and I be-
came really close friends with a
guy who made me realize that
maybe it was possible for some-
one else to care about me. He
treated me like I was special and
made me feel safe, and I started
to build up my conﬁdence and

_ realize I was better than the boy

back home.

When I went home for Feb-
ruary Break, I tried to maintain
my friendship with my ex be-
cause I have a hard time letting
go of people, and I didn’t want
to feel like I had wasted the last
two years of my life by being de-
voted to someone that I was en-
tirely cutting out. I politely told
him that I didn’t want to keep
things going the way that they
had been, and that I had feelings

for my friend at school who had
taught me that I didn’t deserve to
be treated the way my ex treated
me. My ex said that he respected
that. He lied.

We were alone together on
his birthday, and I had been
texting my ‘crush,’ I guess you
could call him. My ex didn’t take
very well to this, and he grabbed
me and started trying to kiss me.
I told him that I didn’t want that,
and he told me I didn’t really
have a choice. He said I couldn’t
ﬁght it and that I couldn’t change
what was meant to be, and that
my crush didn’t really care about
me because no one but him ever
would. He told me Iwasn’t worth
people caring about and that I
was lucky he still did after how
ungrateful I had been by spend-

‘ ing so much time getting close to

my crush.

I tried again to get him to
stop, but at this point he was tak-
ing my clothes off. I realized that
no wasn’t an answer, and when I
tried to push him off he threw me
against the ﬂoor so hard that my
body started to ache. I made my-
self stop feeling because I didn’t
want him to see me cry.

For a long time after that I
told myself that it couldn’t possi-
bly have been rape, just because
the act was something that I had

participated in with him before.
But that doesn’t change the fact
that I said no, or the fact that he
had told me he would respect that
I didn’t want that. That doesn’t
change the fact that I regret it
and that I want to cry every time
I think about it. It doesn’t change
the fact that I feel sick inside
now just like I did then when my
head smashed into the wall when
he threw me down. That should
have never happened to me, and
I hope it never happens to anyone
else. Never let someone convince
you that you have to do what he
or she says because no one else
will ever care about you. It’s not
true. I know it’s hard to feel that
way, when your ﬁrst relationship
is all that you have to base your
experience off, but if it doesn’t
feel right, it’s not, and don’t let
anyone tell you you’ll never be
able to do better.

Shakespearewith a W&L twist

W&L Shakespeare Society sﬁrst performance is a modern interpretation of “Love :9 Labour 3* Lost”

By Allison Chopin
MANAGING EDITOR

Frats and srats, Hawaiian
grass skirts and pot-smoking
Elizabethans?

That doesn’t sound like your
typical production of Shake-
speare.

The Washington and Lee
Shakespeare Society gave Shake-
speare a W&L twist with its ﬁrst
production on Saturday in the
Johnson Theater. The brand
new, entirely student-run the-
ater troupe performed William

Shakespeare’s comedy, “Love’s
Labour’s Lost.”

In this play, the king of Na-
varre and his three companions
promise themselves to three
years of study and take an oath
to avoid the company of women.
But a princess and her three la-
dies are on their way to the court,
and in comedic fashion, the king
and his nobles fall in love and
conspire to woo these women.

Junior Jean Chapman, direc-

tor, said in a talk-back following
the performance that the script
reminded her of W&L’s Greek
system, since a group of girls in-
trude on the house of men who
have sworn off relationships, and
hilarious courting rituals ensue.
The Shakespeare Society’s
modern interpretation of the play
brings these elements to life, in-
corporating modern dress and
props and subtly portraying the
king’s court and the princess and

her ladies as stereotypical frater-
nity and sorority members.

In one scene, for example,
the princess and her ladies and
envoy, played by Emma Patrick,
Danielle Maurer, Adriana Gon-
zalez, Sharon Chu and Ellen Val-
entine, get drunk from bottles of
Smirnoff and a Solo cup before
meeting with the men. In anoth-
er, the king (Levi Throckrnorton)
and his men (Gobind Moore,
Tony.Kelly and Paul Nguyen)

attend a party dressed in tropical
grass skirts and leis, mimicking
the tropical themed parties held
by W&L fraternities.

The cast featured a mix of tal-
ent and experience. The intent
behind the Shakespeare Society,
according to Chapman, is to al-
low students who are interested
in Shakespeare and acting, but
may not have the time to act in
a performance by the theater
department, to get involved in a

production.

Chapman also gave credit to
many of the actors for contribut-
ing their own ideas and adding
bits of new humor to the play.
Considering that the cast only
rehearsed for about four weeks,
she said she was pleased with the
production.

Better option for buying books

F irst—year plans

By Tory Dickerson
s TA F F w R IT E R

As fall semester is wrapping
up, winter semester is not far
away. The start of a new semester
means new classes and hundreds
of dollars worth of new books.

Though Washington and Lee
students have the option of sell-
ing back old textbooks at the end
of each semester, the options the
school offers for buying new text
books is fairly limited.

to start textbook

First-year Amy Heard is try-
ing to change that.

Heard’s plan is to start a book
exchange option for W&L stu-
dents; this way, students have
another option as opposed to
spending tons of money at the
bookstore.

She hopes to have people
turn in their books from previous
semesters, and the quality and

number of books they turn in will
determine how many they are al-
lowed to take out.

“It takes a lot of coordina-
tion,“ Heard says.

' Heard hopes to gather a team
of people who would help with
the management process. When
students turn in books, the rough
value of the books will be con-
sidered before students will be

  ms were SON
     PER NIGHT‘-  

allowed to take books out.

For example, if a student
turned in four books he will no
longer use, he is entitled to take
four new books that they would
need for upcoming classes that
someone else had turned in.

In the event that the exchange
program didn’t have a book a
student needs, Heard hopes to
create some sort of credit sys-

tem, so that for the next round of
exchanges that student would be
ensured a book he needed.

Heard has pitched her idea to
the Executive Committee (EC)
and she says they seemed enthu-
siastic about her idea. She would
need to form the exchange as if
it was a club and get it approved
by the EC in order to get the ex-
change up and running.

exchange program so students can save money on books

“The biggest [issue] will be
getting people to actually do it,”
Heard says.

Anyone who has more ques-
tions or wishes to be part of the
management team can contact
Amy Heard at hearda13@mail.

THE RING-TUM PHI 0 5

How Warner and Gary changed the league

Columnist Adam Cancryn looks at the evolution of NFL offenses and the eﬂect on fantasy football

By Adam cancryn
COLUMNIST

1999.

Y2K threatened to paralyze the world.
Ricky Martin was your favorite singer’s
favorite singer. The dotcom frenzy was
the new gold rush. And whether we real-
ized it or not, a revolution was occurring
within the NFL.

Kurt Warner and Olandis Gary are, at
ﬁrst glance, strange bedfellows. Warner
quarterbacked the St. Louis Rams to a
world championship, the ringleader of
the “Greatest Show on Turf.” Ten years
later, he remains a force in the league.

Gary emerged from training camp in
’99 as the Denver Broncos’ top back. He
rushed for 1,159 yards despite playing
for a 6-10 team. Within four seasons,
Gary was out of the league.

Despite their diverging trajectories,
the two combined to leave a lasting
mark on the NFL. Warner showed that
a Super Bowl could be won through the
air, dispelling the belief that a team was
only as good as its running game. And
Gary demonstrated that it didn’t take ex-
ceptional talent to rush for 1,000 yards,
just a skilled offensive line.

Ten years later, we’re seeing the
effects of that ‘99 season. Teams are
throwing more and succeeding. And
while the running back position is still
important, no player is more valuable
now than the quarterback. The NFL has
become a pass—ﬁrst league and, by asso-
ciation, so has fantasy football.

One.

The round in which all knowledge-
able fantasy football owners draft a run-

ning back.

It’s the golden rule for the 18 million
Americans that play the country’s most
popular online game. To win, you draft
a running back ﬁrst.

The reasoning behind such a strategy
is simple. Elite running backs receive
the most touches on the team. The more
touches a player gets, the more chances
he has to gain yards and score touch-
downs. More yards and touchdowns
means more total points, and more
points means more wins for the respec-
tive fantasy team.

But that was before. Like the one-bar
helmet and the Pro Bowl in Hawaii, the
golden rule is on its way out.

Five.

The number of quarterbacks with a
passer rating exceeding 100 through 12
weeks. In a league featuring increasing-
ly complex defensive schemes, it’s as-
tounding that so many quarterbacks are
doing so well. The passer-rating statistic
is not the only way to measure the po-
sition, but a rating over 100 equals ex-
cellent play on the ﬁeld no matter how
you cut it. And this year is setting a new
precedent.

Over the past 10 years, there have
never been more than four 100+ rated
passers. In that same time, only 2004
featured more than nine 90+ rated QBS,
with 11. This year there are 12.

So what’s to explain the sudden im-
provement?

In short, it all goes back to Kurt War-
ner. Once the Rams rode their QB ’s arm

to a championship, other teams began to
shed their run-ﬁrst philosophies. Since
then, the percentage of plays run from
the Shotgun Formation has steadily in-
creased. Teams replaced running plays
with shorter, smarter passes.

And most importantly, the college
game has trickled into the pro ranks.
While the Wildcat offense grabbed head-
lines, the Spread offense is making the
real impact. NFL teams have poached
elements from schools like Florida and
Texas Tech and incorporated them into a
pass-happy game plan.

Teams like the ‘07 New England Pa-
triots only served to reinforce this new
philosophy. And 2009 is set to complete
the revolution. The top four passing
teams in the NFL are a combined 30-14
through 12 weeks.

154/792/9

147/648/8

The number of carries, yards and
touchdowns accumulated by Miami
Dolphins running backs Ricky Williams
and Ronnie Brown, respectively.

Before Brown’s injury sidelined
him for the year, the two were on pace
to become the ﬁrst 1,000 yard rushing
duo since 1985. It would have been a
rare feat, one for which the tandem have
Olandis Gary to thank. Like Warner,
Gary transformed his position. A no-
name running back plugged into Mike
Shanahan’s offense, he demonstrated
that success on the ground isn’t depen-
dent on the quality of the runner, but of
the offensive line. While the carousel

continued in the backﬁeld, the Broncos’
line remained the same.

Since then, the concept of a hier-
archy at running back, with a defined
starter and back up, has been under
siege. First there emerged the special-
ized role of pass catching, 3rd down

back. That spawned the goal line back.

Now, coaches are using up to four backs
interchangeably. In 2003, 13 running
backs averaged more than 20 carries per
game. Only Steven Jackson and Adrian
Peterson make that cut this year.

It is an approach that makes sense.
There is no reason to wear down one
running back when the same total pro-
duction can be had from three. But
while it has worked out well for NFL
teams, there is no worse feeling for fan-
tasy owners than deciding between two
players on game day, and then watching
your benched back score three touch-
downs. Which brings us to the last two
numbers:

Eight and Four.

The number of respective quarter-
backs and running backs among the top
12 fantasy football point scorers.

The key to winning in the NFL and in
your fantasy football league is the same:
ﬁnd players that provide the most value.
Traditionally, this has meant grabbing
a top running back. But survey today’s
NFL landscape, and that thinking looks
mighty outdated.

Quarterbacks are the new sure thing.
ESPN’s preseason rankings listed Drew
Brees, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning,

Warner and Aaron Rodgers as the top
ﬁve QBs. In twelve weeks, those rank-
ings have barely changed, with Rodg-
ers at one, Brees three, Manning four,
Brady six and Warner 13 in total fantasy
points scored.

Compare that to the preseason top
running backs: Peterson, Michael Tum-
er, Maurice Jones-Drew, Matt Forteand
Jackson. Of those, only Jones-Drew and
Peterson are currently in the top 20. And
this year isn’t an anomaly: just ask 2008
LaDainian Tomlinson owners or 2007
Larry Johnson owners.

All of this is not to say that running
backs are no longer valuable to fan-
tasy owners. Chris Johnson is a savior
for thousands of teams and Peterson is
steady as ever. But there is simply no
guarantee either will reprise their star-
ring role year after year.

Meanwhile, top quarterbacks con-
sistently excel no matter their situation.
Rodgers has been sacked a league lead-
ing 44 times. Manning’s number two
option is Pierre Garcon. Brady is com-
ing off a crippling knee injury. Yet fanta-
sy owners of a top-ﬁve quarterback are
likely cruising into the playoffs.

Remember that as the NFL evolves,
so does fantasy football. Pro teams
aren’t crippled by the absence of a top-
ﬂight back and your team shouldn’t be
either.

Lady Generals look to improve after tough early losses

W&L is 1-3, after defeating Hollins University in between losses to Mary Washington, Christoper Newport, and Guilford

By Stephen Peck
surr wnmza

The Washington and Lee University
Women’s basketball team has stumbled
out of the gate, beating Hollins Uni-
versity but dropping matches to Mary
Washington, Christopher Newport and
Guilford College. The team’s out-of-

ton back on November 17th. Typically a
very solid program, the Eagles had some
troubles with W&L, with Mary Wash-
ington leading only 30-29 at half.
Unfortunately, the Generals could not
keep up with the depth of Mary Wash-

“The 1-3 record is a little deceptive. We were very

competitve and we ’re still very excited about our poten-

tial. ”

Meg Ingram, guard

conference games were both against top
25 opponents so the women knew the
start of the season would be a big test.

“The 1-3 record is a little deceptive,”
said sophomore guard Meg Ingram
added. “We were very competitive and
we’re still very excited about our poten-
tial.”

The Generals opened up the year with
a home contest against Mary Washing-

Generals basketball looks to first-years

ington. Ten different players scored for
the Eagles. The Generals’ attack was led
by the big three of sophomore forward
Becca Bolton (16 points), Ingram (16
points) and junior forward Felice Her-
man (six points and nine rebounds).

As expected in the ﬁrst game of the
year, W&L struggled to ﬁnd a consistent
shot. Ingram only connected on three
of 11 three-point attempts and the team

shot 38 percent overall.

But the Generals could not dwell on
the past long as they had to board the
buses just three days later to face off
against Christopher Newport. Against
Christopher Newport, the Generals’ sec-
ond-half struggles continued; they led at
the half 34-32, but a 14-2 second-half
run by the Captains put the game out of
reach with a ﬁnal score of 71-57. Bolton
notched 20 points and seven rebounds,
Ingram netted 16 to go with four steals
and Herman scored seven and grabbed
six boards.

W&L then traveled to Hollins Uni-
versity to open ODAC play on the 30th.
“We’re going to have to go out and
compete every night to do well in the
ODAC,” said Ingram. “It’s a tough con-
ference, but we have great team chemis-
try and strong leadership from our cap-
tains: Allie long and Kaitlyn Kamp.”

After struggling against Mary Wash-
ington and Christopher Newport, the
Generals put on a basketball clinic
versus Hollins, winning by a score of
95 -60. The absurdly high scoring to-
tal was made possible by a plethora of
strong performances and a 32-8 run to

to carry on tradition of greatness

start the game that completely demoral-
ized Hollins. Bolton (22 points on 8-10
shooting), Ingram (18 in just 23 minutes
of play) and ﬁrst-years Rachel Warrick
(18 and nine boards) and Katy Wilson
(12 and seven boards) led the offensive
onslaught.

W&L was lights-out from the ﬁeld
as they shot 48 percent. They also out-
rebounded Hollins 49-31 and tallied 25
assists to just 18 turnovers. Head Coach
Mandy King had to have been pleased
with the effort she got from her team.

With a win now under their belt, the
Generals traveled to face Guilford Col-
lege in hopes of creating a modest win
streak. This was not to be, however,
as Guilford dropped W&L in dramatic
fashion, winning 55-52.

The late-game heroics involved a
clutch three pointer with 1:36 left by
Warrick and two game-tying free throws
by Bolton with just seconds left, but
Guilford knocked down a desperation
three-pointer with just six seconds left
to put the ﬁnal dagger in the Generals.

A heartbreaking game was made
harder to handle as W&L shot a mere
28 percent from the ﬁeld and still almost

What energizes you about tak-

came away with the win.

While the team has had its struggles,
challenges are to be expected when you
combine ranked opponents, early season
shooting troubles and a relatively young
team.

“I think one of our greatest strengths
is that our team is really balanced this
year,” Bolton said. “Everyone can score
and make great plays, and we all share
the ball really well. It’s just a matter of
playing more as a team.”

The Generals will return to action
on Dec. 28 in the Surf & Slam San Di-
ego Hoop Classic. W&L will open with
Simpson. The Generals have every in-
tention of making a statement at the
tournament.

“We deﬁnitely want to win the tour-
nament over Christmas break,” Bolton
said. “We start playing the good ODAC
teams as soon as we get back, so we want
to improve a lot at the tournament.”

The Washington and Lee men’s basketball
team has built up a winning tradition over the
last two seasons and is working to continue
that tradition. ‘

Prior to the 2007-2008 season, the Gen-
erals experienced years and years of losing
records and heartbreaking seasons. Coach
Hutchinson’s recruiting after the 2006-2007
season brought in a crop of young, talented
players with a desire to turn the program
around. But with such a young team, the older
players such as Chris McHugh, Isaiah Good-
man and Ben Heller knew they had to lead
the youthful squad and unify the inexperi-

enced players in order to win. The experience ‘

and guidance shown by those leaders led to
a 15-win season, the ﬁrst winning season for
the Generals in over 10 years. Those players
have since graduated and the Generals have
circled back to another young, inexperienced
team.

This year’s team is composed of three se-
niors, one junior, three sophomores and 10
ﬁrst-years, a young team to say the least.

But the inexperience on the team is excit-
ing for the older players. As the upperclass-

men train and guide these young players, they
have the opportunity to mold their style of
play into the style of a true Generals’ basket-
ball player. The upperclassmen leaders have
had to assume the roles of the players who
taught them when they were young and in-
experienced.

During the olfseason the team did weight
training, team led scrimmages and extra
shooting sessions to prepare for the tough
season ahead and to bond with the new play-
ers.

“We communicated with the younger play-
ers through email, just letting them know the
expectations of the program and how we had
a lot of work to do for the upcoming season,”
said junior point guard Jason Cimino.

Now that the season is underway, it is
clear that the hard work involved in getting
the young players prepared is starting to pay
off.

First-year players such as J.D. Ey, Hans
Harris and Taylor Gilﬁllan have been strong
contributors to the Generals’ success so far
this season. Watching the team, one can see
that there are still many kinks to work out be-

fore the team can reach its maximum poten-
tial, but this can be expected with any young
team. Each game brings the players closer as
they learn to play with one another in a more
fluid and productive manner.

“Players who have graduated have passed
on a sense of unity that will always be in the
Washington and Lee men’s basketball pro-
gram,” said senior captain Zac White. “The
further the season goes, the closer the team
gets, as always. This is because of how hard
we work together. Everyone understands that
each member of the team has a role and is
dependent on each other to fulﬁll that role.
That is what our team is built on.”

The talent level is already higher than
ever before and the unity needed for another
successful season is developing rapidly. The
leadership and effort of the older players is
showing on the court. The lessons learned
from past players have been cast onto the
gifted ﬁrst-year athletes. The tools are in
place and the team seems eager and ready to
embark on its third straight winning season.

:ogether we can make a positive
:hange on campus.

What has been one of your
most rewarding aspects of
leadership at W&L?

As a volleyball team captain, it

ias helped me become a stronger
eader and represent our school well.
What legacy of leadership do you hope to leave for oth-
ers who follow you here? Anyone can be a leader in their own

 

way, and some of the strongest influence can come from leading by
zxample.

Any words of advice for them? A lot of responsibility

Generals bounce back

T he Generals regained momentum with Close weekend win over Averett; now 5 -2

By Hank Nathan
5 TA F F w R IT E R

Following a narrow loss to Bridgewa-
ter earlier in the week, the Washington and
Lee men’s basketball team found a way
to win another tight contest as it outlasted
Averett 61-58 and improved its record to
5-2 overall.

STEELE BURROW/ Staff Photographer

Senior forward Andrew Payne
cheers on his teammates from
the sidelines in the Generals’
68-64 loss to Bridgewater on
Wednesday.

Despite a furious second-half come-
back attempt, the Generals fell short
against the Bridgewater Eagles 68-64 on
Wednesday.

With just under 10 minutes remaining
in the game, the Blue and White trailed
55-32. But the team was undeterred by
the scoring gap and went on a 30-6 run
over the course of the next eight minutes
to gain a 62-61 advantage. Unfortunately,
the lead was short-lived as the Eagles
leading-scorer, Dominic Trawick. hit a
fade away jumper off of his own offensive
rebound and Bridgewater went on to win
the game.

Although the Generals came up short
in the end, it shows a lot about this team’s
perseverance, said junior guard Jason
Cimino.

“The Bridgewater comeback was fu-
eled by a lot of heart and determination,"
Cimino said. “We dug ourselves a huge
hole and knew the only way to come back
was to scratch and claw and ﬁght our way
back into the game. This team has a lot
of heart; it’s just a matter of using it the
whole game, not after we get down by 20
points."

The last time the two teams met was in
the conference tournament last year when
the Generals knocked off Bridgewater in
the semiﬁnals. Seeking revenge against

W&L for ending their season, the Eagles
came out fast on both offense and defense.
In the ﬁrst half, Bridgewater shot 60.9
percent from the ﬁeld, while holding the
Blue and White to just 23.8 percent. in all,
Bridgewater built a 34-19 halftime lead.

Even though Cimino opened the sec-
ond stanza with a three-pointer, the Eagles
continued their offensive prowess and in-
creased their lead. After the Generals were
down by 23, the team changed its defen-
sive philosophy and this decision helped
to propel the squad. said senior captain
Ben Goetsch.

“In the middle ofthe second half, we re-
ally started to put the pressure on [Bridge-
water] with traps and an aggressive press,"

said Goetsch. “We were fortunate to get a .

few tumovers out of that and capitalized
at the other end. It was encouraging to see
that we did not fold when we were far be-
hind, even though we would rather have
not put ourselves in that position.”

With the added defensive pressure,
W&L forced 20 second—half turnovers
and 32 total for the game. Cimino led the
team with a career-high six steals and that
translated into points on the offensive end.
Goetsch added 17 in the second halfto ﬁn-
ish with a game-high 27.

And with 1:08 remaining in the game,
it was Goetsch who nailed a three-pointer
from the top of the arc to give the Gener-
als the brief one point lead. However, the
Eagles went on to score seven more points
in the contest to close out the game.

In the encounter, ﬁrst-year guard Doug

Poetzsch tallied 11 points, including some
clutch three-balls in the come-back ef-
fort. Senior forward Zac White added nine
points and sevenrebounds.

On Saturday, the Generals travelled to

play Averett University. Once again, W&L

came out of the gates slowly and fell down
by double ﬁgures. However, unlike the
Bridgewater game, the Blue and White
battled back immediately. Toward the end
of the ﬁrst half, Poetzsch continued his
hot shooting from the previous game and
scored seven points to narrow the gap to
25-27. With 28 seconds remaining in the
opening frame, Goetsch stole the ball on

the defensive end and drove the length of
the court to convert a layup while being
fouled; this knotted the score at 27-27 at
the half.

The Generals carried its momentum
into the second half and built a 41-32 lead.
The nine point margin was punctuated with
a dunk by ﬁrst-year forward J .D. Ey off of
a backdoor pass from sophomore guard
Kyle Bond. The Cougars then chipped
away at the lead and deadlocked the score
at 48-48 with 5:35 left in the game.

Momentum had swung back in Av-
eret_t’s favor as they scored the next ﬁve
points in the game. Senior forward An-
drew Payne ignited the Generals after
coming off the bench and scoring seven of
11 of the team’s points (and 13 total for the
game) to re-gain a 59-58 lead with 37.5
seconds to go.

In the end, it was W&L’s defense which
forced an Averett shot clock violation on
the next possession to seal the contest. The

‘Generals put an exclamation point on the

game with a Poetzsch layup in the ﬁnal
seconds, making the ﬁnal score 61-58.

This year, the Washington and Lee
men’s basketball team hopes that it can
take the next step and win a conference
title after narrowly falling short one sea-
son ago.

“My goal this season is the same as
every other season since I have been here
- to win the ODAC,” said Goetsch. “The
league is especially strong this year, but
we have been competitive with or beaten
every team in the league over the past

year. I believe that we can push ourselves
to the top of the standings, especially as
this year’s ﬁrst-year class continues to
learn and improve."

VOLUME CXIII, NUMBER 10

By Klrsten Kyne
STAFF WRITER

300 students’ Winter Break was
postponed when the largest snowstorm
in 100 years hit Lexington. Many
students who were expecting to leave
after their last ﬁnal late in the week
were disappointed upon hearing that
I-81 was completely inaccessible.

The University did not have any

been made to students on campus,
but it was fun.”

Some students were able to walk
to Kroger, which remained open
despite the storm, and used the
kitchens in Gaines residence hall.
Other students’ families were with
them so they went to local restaurants.
F irst—year Zachary Huey was able to
dine at local favorite Southern Inn

we were able to hang out and unwind from

the stress of ﬁnals week. We went sledding

and took pictures. ”

ANNIE ZHANG, ﬂrst-year

plan to deal with a situation as serious
as this unexpected snowstorm. The
dining hall had already shut down for
the break so students who lived on
campus had no access to food.

“I understand that the workers at
D-Hall probably couldn’t get there
either, but there was no food at all,”
said first-year Matthew Coburn.
“More accommodations could have

with his dad and brother.

Dominos pizza was a big favorite
among those remaining on campus.

“The buffalo chicken pizza
is ‘noice,”’ said first-year Alex
Schuyler.

Although there wasn’t food
available for the first few days,
students agree that the University
did a good job of making sure the
sidewalks and roads were clear.

“They kept the roads fairly clean
and had people working hard to keep
the sidewalks usable, every available
shovel was on the job of keeping the
situation livable,” said Huey.

Schuyler felt that the University
did a good job keeping their students
informed about the situation. “They
sent out plenty of e-mails warning us
about the weather.”

Students made the best of their
less than ideal situation. “I built a
giant snowman, took pictures, made
hot chocolate, and watched Christmas
movies,” said Coburn. Huey was able
to build an igloo with his brother.

“Luckily, some of my friends
were also snowed in so we were able
to hang out and unwind from the
stress of ﬁnals’ week,” said Annie
Zhang. “We went sledding and took
pictures.”

The city of Lexington had not
been anticipating the severity of such
a large blizzard heading their way. “I
got stuck in a ditch Friday and I had to
wait for a tow truck that didn’t come
for three hours,” said Schuyler. “I
was supposed to wait by my car for
eight hours the next day for a tow
truck, it was still snowing outside.
Luckily, I found someone to tow my
car quickly.”

Winter fun in the sun...and sand

Taglit-Birthright program sends four W&L students to Israel for winter break, giving them the experience of a lifetime
By Eleanor Kennedy and Levl Throckmorton

STAFF WRITERS

For most Washington and Lee
students, the question “What did
you do over break?” yields a fairly
boring answer.

But for seniors Emily Martin
and Zach Segall and sophomores
Josh Posner and Lev Raslin, the
answer was anything but boring.
These lucky students spent 10
days in Israel over break through
Taglit-Birthright Israel.

The Birthright program is
free for Jewish students. Private
philanthropists, the Israeli gov-
emment and Jewish communities
fund it. In order to participate in
the program, students must ﬁll out
an application, write and essay,
and be interviewed.

According to Segall, the pro-

cess is not particularly demand-
ing but “it does really- almost
entirely- on luck, as spot on most
trips are in pretty high demand.”

While in Israel, the W&L
students travelled with 40 other
students from around the country,
as well as seven Israeli soldiers
in civilian clothes, according to
Posner and Raslin.

Posner said he enjoyed travel-
ling with the Israeli soldiers. “It
was cool to get to know them as
peers rather than soldiers. They
wereour age,” he said.

The students traveled through
almost every part of Israel dur-
ing the trip. They visited some
famous and memorable sights
such as The Golan Heights, the

West Bank, Jerusalem and Tel
Aviv. They also rode camels in
the Negev desert and went to the
Dead Sea.

saw what Segall describes as
“the single most moving tribute
to the holocaust I have ever seen
in my life.”

“My favorite part was bonding with other

Jewish people my age and the Israeli sol-

J

ders. ’

Josh Posneri soghomore

For Segall, one of the most
amazing parts of the trip was
Yad Vashem, the Israeli holocaust
memorial and museum.

While visiting the beautifully
constructed museum, the students

Raslin said the Ein Gedi, a
waterfall oasis in the middle of the
desert, was his favorite site among
the places he visited.

“It is also a sanctuary for vari-
ous animals and was deﬁnitely

a refreshing break from the hot
sun,” he said.

Raslin said the trip was also a
cultural learning experience.

“We were there for the last day
of Chanukah as well as Christmas,
so we felt very honored to spend
the day in Israel and see the
relationships between different
cultures,” he said.

Posner also enjoyed learning
about Israeln from a different
point of view.

“My favorite part was bonding
with other Jewish people my age
and the Israeli soldiers,” he said.
“It was good to get an insider’s
perspective on the country.”

The students said they formed
friendships with the other Jewish

students and the Israelis quickly
and easily during the trip.

“The best part of the experi-
ence for me was coming away
with a new sense of Jewish pride,
as well as the speed with which
we made friends,” said Raslin.

“It’s usually difficult for me to
make friends quickly, and the fact
that everyone was there for the
same reason sort of facilitated the
speed of making new friends.”

W&L Hillel has participated
in the Birthright program for
seven years.

While there were many students remaining on campus, there were
also a fair amount of students stranded at the many regional airports
such as Roanoke and Richmond. .
One such student was ﬁrst-year Steele Burrow. “I slept in the
Richmond airport on Friday night, but managed to get a hotel on
Saturday and Sunday night. I ﬁnally was able to get a ﬂight back on
Monday morning.”
The same situation happened to Melissa Horadam. “I slept on the
ﬂoor in Richmond airport and I woke up and there was a horrible rash
on my face. It was terrible.”
“I watched movies on my laptop and read a book,” said Horadam.
Others ventured out into the cold to play in the snow while it was still
fresh.
These students were able to eat at the restaurants in the airports,
but Burrow reports that he “did manage to ﬁnd a Qdoba near the hotel, .
which was quite a blessing.” (Side note: he does not recommend eating
Applebee’s four times within a weekend.)
Though the situation was not what others were hoping for, students
still did the best with what they had. Most students were able to leave
Lexington Sunday night or Monday morning but then had to tackle the
long lines and chaos at airports.
“Sunday night, I had to travel to Richmond, navigate more ﬂight
cancellations and deal with unplowed interstates,” said Cobum.
By Tuesday, all students were able to make it home to their families
for the holidays. Though they didn’t make I home when expected,
many still had fun during their few extra days on campus. This goes
to show that Washington and Lee students are capable of making the
best out of any situation given to them. ~

Gilbert Arenas: a truly funny observation

Basketball player Gilbert Arenas is facing jail time for taking a practical joke a little too practically

By Stockton Bullltt
OPINIONS EDITOR

While most of you spent your
Winter Break hanging out with
friends, sledding down Lexing-
ton’s hills or making one too
many mistakes on New Year’s
Eve, I spent the break religiously
following ESPN.

Yeah, maybe there were other
things going on in my life, like
friends and family for example,
but none of these people were
nearly as entertaining as the
Washington Wizards’ guard, Gil-
bert Arenas.

For those of you who didn’t
spend their break following this
story, Arenas was recently ac-
cused of bringing guns into his
team’s locker room during prac-
tice in December. Because of this
accusation, he is now suspended
indeﬁnitely by the NBA and has
recently pled guilty to a felony
weapons charge, and the Wizards
franchise might void his $111
million contract.

Most of us, if placed in his
situation, would feel an over-

whelming sense of regret and
personal remorse for getting into
that kind of trouble. Gilbert Are-
nas on the other hand seemed
nonchalant throughout the entire
initial process of getting caught
with the guns.

In fact, David Stern chose to
suspend Arenas only after seeing
a photo of him making fake guns
with his ﬁngers during a pregame
warrn-up. By the way, he chose
to do the “shooter” pose a day
after releasing a statement for-
mally expressing his regret for
what he did.

Predictably, media has been
outraged at Arenas’ bravado
ﬁom beginning to end. They
openly and rightly condemn Are-
nas for bringing guns into a pub-
lic arena, but they go further in
codemnig his actions.

The Wizards are now re-
vamping their entire marketing
campaign around the apparently
heinous issue and have profusely
apologized to fans for what hap-

pened. Arenas has now fully
achieved the public pariah status
that will make him completely

unmarketable in the NBA. His
future is a now a bleak one with
certain jail time and countless
losses in earnings to come.

Nevertheless, I loved the
joke.

According to multiple sourc-

happened that led to Gilbert Are-

Lil Wayne is on top of the music industry, and he is doing it with
an alien-like work ethic, says columnist Jonathan Salm

By Jonathan Salm
c o L U M N I s T

Every decade or so, select in-
dividuals have come to dominate
the American musical landscape.

The hippies and beatniks of
the sixties and seventies had Jimi
Hendrix, Janis Joplin and the
Grateﬁil Dead. The eighties had
Michael Jackson, and the nineties
had Kurt Cobain.

For the first decade of the new
millennium, that individual is
unquestionably Lil Wayne AKA
Weezy F. Baby AKA Dwayne
Michael Carter, Jr. However rev-
olutionary his rhymes and ﬂow
may be, there remains something
a little off about Lil Wayne.

Nevermind the fact that Wayne
already sets himself apart from
other modern entertainers be-
cause of his overwhelming domi-
nance and constant presence on
the Billboard charts. It still seems
like Wayne is a little too good at
what he does. Granted, so were
Hendrix, et al, but Wayne takes it
to a whole new level.

The man records nearly every
hour he is awake (he famously
installed a studio in his tour bus
to take his beats on the road), and
he manages to consistently put
out both underground mixtapes
and platinum selling studio al-
bums while still ﬁnding the time
to make guest appearances on
tracks by artists from Birdman to
Weezer. Even GQ noticed, nam-
ing him the workaholic of the
year in 2007.

And the most ridiculous part:

-Wayne dominates the rap industry

in an era of falling sales and less
big name starts, while also man-
aging to be in a certain level of
incoherence. The man raps about
his love for swishers and codeine
cocktails and lives his life exactly

marijuana, but it hasn’t stopped
him from enjoying a little mother
nature.

Because Lil Wayne manages
to be one of the world’s hottest
and most proliﬁc hip-hop artists
while simultaneously ingest-

In fact, despite likely heading oﬂ to jail for

a weapons charge, 2010 is looking like the

year of Lil Wayne.

like his songs.

Don’t believe me? Check out
any YouTube video of Wayne
hanging out on a tour bus. The
amount of substances consumed
on his bus can rival W&L tear
night festivities.

Furthermore, Wayne is a bona
ﬁde gangster. It doesn’t matter to
him that he can legally buy a gun
— it’s much more badass to get
one on the streets and then get ar-
rested for it.

As for his love for a certain
green plant, it still remains il-
legal for him to light up. But
for someone as dedicated to his
passions as Lil Wayne, quitting
is not an option, and his persis-
tence is not only evident in his
music, but in his substance abuse
as well. Wayne has been arrested
countless times for possession of

mg insane amounts of a variety
of substances, the only logical
conclusion to come from this
is that Lil Wayne is not human.
Honestly, who can get away with
doing exactly what they want at
all times of the day? No one. It’s
physically impossible. The world
just doesn’t work that way. Well,
except for Lil Wayne, that is.

Wayne wakes up and immedi-
ately does what he loves ~ make
music and smoke weed. Not only
is he able to do what he loves; he
is wildly successful too.

Perhaps I’m just jealous and
unfairly questioning Wayne’s
humanity, but his wild success
makes this question necessary.
In fact, Wayne must have even
anticipated this article, as he
begs the question and answers it
himself in a succinct four-minute

blast in a new track aptly named
“I’m Not Human.” Lyrics like
“Re, Re, Reporting from another
world/Look up in the sky and see
me courting with a cover girl” and
“I am not a human being” only
support my theory. And the song,
a rumored cut from Wayne’s up-
coming rock debut, “Rebirth,” is
actually good!

What human hip-hop artist
can actually produce an instru-
mentally solid rap-rock track that
doesn’t disappoint? While yes,
Lil Wayne’s debut rock single,
“Prom Queen” might’ve been a
step in a more human direction, it
hasn’t hurt his success at all.

In fact, despite likely heading
off to jail for a weapons charge,
2010 is looking like the year of
Lil Wayne. His rock album “Re-
birth” will ﬁnally be released and
so will Tha Carter IV, the heavily
anticipated follow up to 2008’s
triple platinum “Tha Carter III.”
This whole ‘going to jail and
remaining awesome’ concept is
something that just doesn’t hap-
pen. Is any human really able to
do that?

The indisputable answer to
that question is no, and fortu-
nately that answer paves the path
to the truth regarding Lil Wayne’s
humanity. If Wayne does in fact
go to jail yet remains a chart-top-
ping artist, the answer is plain
and simple. However, we must
wait, as only time will tell.

into the locker room and laid
them out in front of Crittenton’s
locker with a note attached that
read, “Pick One.”

And that ladies and gentle-
men is why Gilbert Arenas is
losing nine ﬁgures and going to
jail, and you know what, it was
worth it.

Gilbert Arenas has had a his-
tory of missed jokes with bad tim-
ing, but I think this one ﬁnally hit
the spot. Crittenton was clearly
fronting on Arenas’ manlihood,
so what better way to throw it
completely back in his face?

But seriously, Arenas is losing
a lot of his life over nothing.

Yes, he does own multiple
weapons, which probably aren’t
completely needed, but consider-
ing how gun happy America re-
ally is, I ﬁnd it pretty strange to
criticize Gilbert Arenas for hav-
ing an unloaded gun when foot-
ball superstars Marvin Harrison
and Plaxico Burress have both
ﬁred loaded weapons (Harrison

allegedly ﬁred at others while
Burress only ﬁred at himself).

I know that gun violence is
a problem that America must ﬁx,
but the most violence that Are-
nas could have caused with those
guns is a bruised thigh.

Furthermore, Arenas was
widely criticized for seeming
not to care about the whole or-
deal. The media tends to side
with people who seem like they
care deeply when they make a
mistake. Mark McGwire has re-
cently been forgiven by his fans
for caring about cheating for
_ more than ten years, while Barry
Bonds continues to be reviled for
cheating for half that time.

You already know that we
live in a society that tends to
blow things out of proportion,
but maybe for once, we can all
take a little joke.

Taking a different look at everyday eroticism

Using classroom experience and deﬁnitions, Aleisha Butler reexamines the true meaning of the word “eroticism ”

By Aleisha Butler
c 0 L U M N IS T

It’s the middle of January,
and I’m sure that you’re all feel-
ing the winter ho-hums as much
as I am.

Perpetually overcast skies and
treacherously wet, icy sidewalks
do nothing to lift your mood
when you’re struggling to an 8
a.m. class. The layers of clothes
that make you waddle like a tod-
dler on his ﬁrst sled riding trip
don’t do much for your body
image, either. After the fun and
the calories of the holiday season
have passed, it’s pretty hard to
ﬁnd something to excite you, let
alone to feel sexy about.

In my English class last se-
mester we were exploring themes
of the erotic, what its overarching
deﬁnition is, and what it means
for each of us in our lives.

Erotica is deﬁned as literature
or art pertaining to sexual love or
sexual desire, while eroticism is
deﬁned as sexually suggestive

symbolism or an abnormally per-
sistent sexual drive. However, the
deﬁnition that most interested me
was one that deﬁned eroticism as
a “heightened aesthetic sense.”

This, to me, seemed the most
positive and inclusive deﬁnition,
leaving room for an erotic inter-
pretation of everyday life... and
maybe something to make the
winter months a little more inter-
esting.

Sex and sexual desire are
very often interpreted as taboo,
and not a whole lot of emphasis
is placed on achieving a sen-
sual understanding of the world
around us. We get Very caught up
in our busy, stressful, day-to-day
routine; a few extra moments of
eroticism would go a long way
towards alleviating the pressure
created by the daily grind.

So what do I mean by “mo-
ments of eroticism?” What
are they and how can one ﬁnd

them?

Alter our English class ended,
I was still confused but very in-
trigued by the idea of the erotic
in everyday life. After a lot of
thought and actual out-of-class
discussion with some friends, I

a boiling pot as cleansing and re-
freshing, the heat rising up from
a toaster to warm your icy nose

ing: each of these, and inﬁnite
other examples, offers an avenue

insides.

came to the tentative conclusion
that that “heightened aesthetic
sense” is a way of giving your-
self the opportunity to ﬁnd the
erotic in the world around you.
It’s a change in perspective
that you must consciously make.
The act of painting as soothing or
exciting, the steam clouds above

mundane, earthy way.

These little erotic interludes
are not necessarily sexual in na-
ture, but they make us aware of
ourselves in a way that we nor-
mally are not. Appreciating the
texture of rain on our skin or the
smell of wood smoke in our hair
the morning after a bonﬁre is

not inherently connected to sex,
but by being more aware of our-
selves we are only more aware of
the possibilities that our bodies
offer us.

I would like to return to the
notion of eroticism as an “ab—
normally persistent sexual drive”
and offer a different perspective.
A sensual, perceptive understand-
ing of your body and the way it
moves through space, the way it
interacts with other elements and
people around it, is critical for a
healthy, self-aware existence.

Sexual desire is not evil, and
acknowledging the slightly sexu-
al pull that you feel for a cup of
hot coffee, a pair of designer sti-
lettos or that vintage Aston-Mar-
tin is not weird. It’s human.

It is human to experience
desire and excitement over the
things that make us feel alive,
and we perceive those sensations
with our bodies.

Trying to build some eroti-
cism into your everyday life is
not abnormal; it just requires a
little patience, as we never really
think about interpreting everyday
life in a sensual, charged way.

This winter, think about your
favorite cozy sweater more like
an old, reliable lover. Think
about how much ass you could
kick in those thick, heavy snow
boots.

And, as one of my roommates
has said, chicken noodle soup re-
ally is a hug for your insides.

Last semester I wrote about
ﬁnding passion in your life, for
the little or the big things, and
this idea of everyday sexuality is
very much the same.

Seniors should enjoy their last few months, not fear them

As graduation approaches, law student Jordan Rothman advises the seniors to relax during their last days on campus

By Jordan Rothman
COLU M NIST

One year ago, I was in the
shoes of many seniors at this
university. I was scared at the
uncertainty of my future, and a
little bit saddened by the thought
of my impending graduation.

I had classes to tend to, a the-
sis to write, and through it all, I
had to try and have a good time
through all the stresses and anxi-
eties of senior year.

One year older and wiser, I
realize that much of this trepida-
tion was unwarranted. Life does
not end when college ends, and
graduation does not have to be
such a saddening and depressing
event.

Furthermore, experiencing
my senior year has given me
ﬁrst—hand knowledge about what
the seniors at this university can
expect in the upcoming months.

I’d like to convey this infor-
mation along with a little advice
about how to tackle one’s senior
year.

In many ways, graduating can
appear to be a lot like dying. Tru-
ly, it may seem like graduation is
the end of one’s existence, and I
can reasonably see why someone
who has spent the past 4 years at
the same enterprise would deem
this viewpoint to be the case.

 

People try to console seniors,
try to tell them that everything
will be alright. Yet, as they fran-
tically search for something to
do post-graduation, and are bur-
dened by pressing academic con-
cerns, it appears like graduation
is something to be feared. V

may be unable to pursue what
one truly desires in this world
while a college student. Yet, all
this changes at graduation, and I
can’t stress enough how positive
commencement can be.

One piece of advice that I
would like to give to the seniors
is not to worry about what they

will be doing post-graduation.
Few, if any, students know early
on in the year what their exact
plans will be after commence-
ment. I

Still, there is no need to have a
“quarter-life crisis” because you
are unsure of your future plans.
In fact, I have had friends who
didn’t get jobs until right around
graduation or later, and they are
perfectly happy at their current
vocations.

Furthermore, I can’t stress
enough how good it might be to
take a break between graduation
and the next part of your life.
Truly, you cannot underestimate
the power of a “gap year,” as this
time is a unique opportunity that
you may never again have for the
rest of your life.

Five, ten or ﬁfteen years from
now, you will probably be in a
long term relationship, have a
job, have a mortgage, and be
bound by a number of other obli-
gations. These obliogations will
seriously impede your capacity
in the future to travel, dedicate
yourself to national service, or do
something that you have always
desired.

Do not feel pressured by fam-
ily, societal inﬂuences, or other

forces to simply go straight to
graduate school, for if you do,
you will be wasting a valuable
opportunity.

Personally, I could not see
myself taking time off between
undergrad and law school, and
I have seen ﬁrst—hand some dis-
advantages of taking this path.
All told, these are the last years
of your youth, and don’t waste
them away through additional
study and toil.

As your senior year progress-
es, you will ﬁnd that everyone’s
inhibitions begin to lower. Con-
fronted with the impending
graduation, people are especially
sincere to others about their feel-
ings, and are willing to do wild
and crazy things. I would take
full advantage of this. Now, I
don’t mean to imply that you
should utilize this condition in a
nefarious way.

What I do mean is that you
should reconnect with your class-
mates in an honest fashion dur-
ing your last months of college.
For instance, close to graduation
last year, I had people come up
to me and tell me how much they
appreciated my presence in their
lives. I in turn was also sincere
about my feelings, and used the

last vestiges of my “collegiate
immunity” to do the wildest and
craziest things of my college ca-
reer.

All told, the closer it is to
graduation, the more inclined
people will be to have fun and
loosen up. I hope you take full
advantage of this situation, so
that you can enjoy the last days
of your college experience to the
fullest.

Graduation is not the end of
the world, no matter how you
may feel about it now. In fact, it
can be the beginning of a won-
derful chapter in your life, and I
encourage all who are capable to
use their post-graduation years
toward attaining experiences
they will be unable to have later
in life.

You know, most people say
that these are the best times of
your life, and I would add to this
by defending that senior year is
probably better than any other
part of the college experience.

In the end, I hope you enjoy
this time to the fullest, and don’t
let graduation or an uncertain fu-
ture wear you down.

Sexual assault articles are detrimental

Writer takes issue with series of sexaul assault accounts that appeared last term.

Rape and sexual assault at
Washington and Lee are serious
problems that warrant close ex-
amination and demand our every
effort to provide an effective so-
lution.

An environment where sexual
assault and rape exist is the exact
opposite of what should deﬁne
the Washington and Lee commu-
nity. This problem will be solved
primarily through awareness,
and the forum that has been cre-
ated by campus programs such as
One-in-F our, End It, and the Red
Flag Campaign have been an im-
portant step towards creating a
better informed and more visible
discussion of the problems on
W&L’s campus.

That being said, there are both
effective and ineffective ways
to promote the discussion that
will be central to ending sexual
assault on campus. Publishing
graphic accounts of rape in the
Ring-Tum Phi every week is not
an efﬁcient way to promote this
important discussion.

The victim’s accounts of rape
and sexual assault are tackling an
important issue that makes steer-

ing away from a culture of sexual
assault difﬁcult: many people do
not truly believe the egregious
terms that the statistics dictate.
But these accounts, intended to
raise awareness, are graphic to
the point that they seem to be an
accusation that stiﬂes the same
open forum on sexual relations
that they aim to encourage.

It has become easier to talk
about the graphic nature of the
accounst published in the Phi
each week than the underlying
problems in the culture that are
the cause of the behavior. Con-
versation tends towards the vul-
garity of these stories, and not
what can be done to better gen-
der relations.

Because these stories are so
frequent and graphic, they have
come to dominate the discussion
of sexual assault and rape on
campus. This carries the discus-
sion to the extremes of what is
going on, and can prevent mean-
ingful actions from being taken.

Changing a culture that pro-
motes sexual assault will require
meaningful interactions from,
and participations by, both of the

genders.

Making men read stories
about rape while using the re-
stroom does not encourage any
participation. In fact, doing so
creates an extreme image of the
situation that discourages par-
ticipation and makes it much
easier to say, “That type of thing
does not apply to me.” This is a
huge problem; sexual assault is
an issue that applies to the entire
community at W&L.

The Red Flag Initiative has
been a successful method of in-
creasing awareness of sexual
assault and gender issues on
campus. The Red Flag posters
describe a situation that could
easily occur on campus and then
point out what is wrong with a
certain behavior.

The posters have challenged
issues that are present at W&L,
such as students trying to get their
dates drunk so they will hook up
with them, without resorting to
the frequent and graphic images
that characterize the stories of
rape across campus.

These posters encourage
conversation and participation

of people from both sexes and
all sexual orientations because
they don’t portray one group as
the problem and the other as the
victim.

It would be convenient to
write that these stories do not be-
long in the Phi because they rep-
resent things that do not happen
on campus. Hopefully, someone
will be able to argue that in the
future. Unfortunately this is not
the reality at our university.

The victims accounts are
necessary because they bring at-
tention to the fact that this type
of behavior exists and is a real
problem.

What is not necessary is pub-
lishing them in the Ring-Tum Phi
every week, and placing copies
in men’s rooms across campus.
Doing so is counterproductive; it
detracts from the very conversa-
tion on our campus that they aim
to beneﬁt.

Profiles
in

Leadership:
Emibl Coyle

What energizes you about taking on
leadership responsibilities? I love being
able to give back to the organizations that
I’m involved in, and to help rising classes of
W&L students derive the joy and benefits
that I have found in these organizations.
Riding, for instance, has completely framed
my life here. Through Captains Council I
can serve as a resource to other captains in
other sports. Ultimately, we all face similar
leadership challenges and development even though W&L boasts
upward of 20 very different varsity sports. Greek life gives me a
similar energy: I enjoy helping first-year women navigate the Greek
system here. What has been one of your most rewarding
aspects of leadership at W&L? One of the most rewarding
aspects of leadership at W&L is that leadership here comes in all
forms and in a variety of both traditional and unconventional ven-
ues. Although being captain of an athletic team is a pretty conven-
tional leadership role, riding outside of the collegiate setting is an
individual sport. It is exhilarating to work with my teammates to
foster a team dynamic and to work towards a common goal, some-
thing that as varsity college athletes they may actually never have
done before coming to W&L though many of them have competed
in our sport for twelve or more years.

What legacy of leadership do you hope to leave for oth-
ers who follow you here? I hope to leave my unique perspec-
tive on the issues that I have tackled here. We all bring something
different to the conversation and that shouldn’t disappear when we
‘graduate. Any words of advice for them? If you want to be
involved here, you can be, and if you want your voice to be heard,
there are people who will listen. Simply do what energizes you I

Fresh new music picked by WLUR

W&L s only campus radio station tells us what ﬁve artists to watch in 201 0 for new sounds, releases and hot concerts

ByWLUR staff
surr wnmzns

It’s impossible to know what
other wonders Lady Gaga will
grace us with this year, but here
are WLUR’s picks for some oth-
er artists to watch in the ﬁrst part
of 2010:

1. Vampire Weekend

While early 2008 saw the re-
lease of the group’s much-praised
self-titled album, the buzz sur-
rounding Vampire Weekend
continues to swell thanks to the
release of the group’s sophomore
record, Contra, on XL Record-
ings last week. And what a way
to ring in the new year. With
songs that blend delicate guitar
picking and keyboard twiddling
with Afro-pop percussion, Con-
tra sets the bar high as far as in-

die pop goes in 2010.

While a lot of folks go either
way about this band ~ some see
these Ivy League prepsters as
endearing for their lyrics that
question the importance of the
Oxford comma and somehow
bookend the words “Cape Cod”
and “Kwassa Kwassa,” while
others blast them for their preten-
tiousness and as little more than
copycats of what Paul Simon did
on his classic 1986 album Grace-
land — this new record is most
certainly a step forward in their
songwriting. Contra is sure to

please old fans and ﬁnd a place
on the iPods of plenty of new lis-
teners too. And for those willing
to make the trek up to D.C., the
band will be playing DAR Con-
stitution Hall in early April.

2. Beach House

Another group that’s steadily
rising in the ranks of the indie
world, Beach House is known
for its blend of reverb-drenched
guitar and murky keyboards, not
to mention the deep-honeyed
voice of singer Victoria Legrand.
Legrand makes up one half of
this dynamic duo, formed in Bal-
timore in 2004, which has since
become a master of what many
call “dream pop.” Appropriately
enough, the group’s third record,
Teen Dream, was recorded in
a converted church in upstate
New York that the band dubbed
“Dreamland.”

The new album is due out
this week on Sub Pop Records,
home of indie staples like Blit-
zen Trapper, The Shins, and Iron
and Wine. And Teen Dream is
the much-anticipated follow-up
to the group’s last release, Devo-
tion, which deﬁnitively claimed
a spot as one of WLUR’s top
ten albums of 2008. Fans of ev-
eryone from Grizzly Bear to the
Velvet Underground will easily

Smashing it:
Gamers seek to
set record

By Holly Suthers
STAFF WRITER

Students aim for a spot on the

list of Guinness World Records
for their 24-hour Super Smash
Brothers session last spring

Not many Washington and
Lee students can claim to have
a world record, however, three
students recently achieved this
title through gaming.

Chris Veddem, Phil Jack-
son, Jennifer Pritchett, all soph-
omores, and Arturo Roa, who
graduated last year, performed
the longest non-stop game of

article.

Avid Nintendo 64 gamers,
the four have been playing for
years. Pritchett has been this
system for seven years and has
played Super Smash Broth-
ers for two years. Veddem has
been playing for nine. The team
decided to play Super Smash
Brothers because it allowed

in life. ‘What did you do during college? ’

‘Set a world record.

Jennlfer Prltchett, sophomore record setter
 

Super Smash Brother on Nin-
tendo 64.

The four students played
the game for 24 hours and ﬁve
minutes. Each member played
the entire duration, withstand-
ing the challenges.

“The length of it was most
taxing for me. It may not seem
like it, sitting still and main-
taining focus for that length of
time can be quite exhausting,”
said Veddem.

Veddem and Pritchett said
that once they initially had the
idea for the world record, they
had to follow through with it.

“It sounded like a good sto-
ry to tell later in life. ‘What did
you do during college?’ ‘Set a
world record,’” said Pritchett.

Pritchett contacted Guin-
ness World Records in Sep-
tember of 2008 and ﬁnalized
the paper work this past April.
As part of the validation pro-
cess to Guiness, the group must
have a newspaper article writ-
ten to validate the event. The
Ring—tum Phi will serve as this

each player to have inﬁnite
lives, and therefore they could
play one continuous game.

This past May, the four sat
down to start playing and ﬁn-
ished an entire day later to room
full of people cheering them on
for the last ﬁve minutes.

“Cheering doesn’t often
happen in the world of gaming.
That was by far the best part,”
said Pritchett.

While each student individ-
ually played, the four recognize
that it was a team effort from
the start.

“Those who aided us in the
logistics of running the world
record attempt and watched,
you know who you are and I
can’t thank you enough for sup-
porting our endeavor,” Pritchett
said.

be seduced by Beach House’s
ghostly tunes. And converts to
the Beach House sound can check
the group out for a homecoming

show in Baltimore in May.
3. Midlake
Midlake is the seasoned

veteran of this short list, hav-

folkier sound, inspired by British
artists like Fairport Convention.
Frontman Tim Smith told indie
music Web site Pitchfork Me-
dia that it was the “fair maiden”
quality of British folk that really
resonated when the band set to
making Courage. Perhaps in an

ing formed in Denton, Texas in
1999. Yet the group has only
released two records, and its last
record, The Trials of Van Occu-
panther, came out way back in
2006. Still, Midlake’s sound has
been praised for its unabashed
nods to classic rock artists like
Neil Young, Jethro Tull, and
F leetwood Mac.

According to the band’s la-
bel, Bella Union, Midlake’s new
record, The Courage of Others,
will trade the ‘70s-era rock for a

effort to get closer to their British
inﬂuences, these guys have left
the states for a bit of a European
tour before they return to some
shows in the western U.S.

4. Yeasayer

Another New York act —
though they hail from Brooklyn,
not Broadway — Yeasayer is a
staunch defender of experimen-
tal psychedelic rock. The group
has toured with more eccentric
acts like Beck, MGMT, and Man
Man, and it’s safe to say that

Yeasayer is even quirkier than
Vampire Weekend and gloomier
than Beach House. (If it helps,
the band members themselves
refer to the group’s sound “Mid-
dle Eastem-psych-pop-snap-gos-
pel.”) While experimental and
art-rock acts like Animal Collec-
tive and Dirty Projectors topped
many best-of lists in 2009, Yea-
sayer is set to throw its name into
the ring when its new record,
Odd Blood, is released in early
February on Secretly Canadian.
If lead single “Ambling Alp” is
any indication, they might be
poised to claim 2010. The group
is touring all over Europe and the
U.S. for the next several months,
with a stop at D.C.’s 9:30 Club
on April 3.

5. jj

Swedish indie-popper jj re-
leased its debut album, jj n° 2,
early last year on a label back
home. The record earned jj a
spot in Pitchfork’s coveted “Best
New Music” list and since then,
the group has signed to American
label Secretly Canadian. Now, jj
n° 3 is due out in early March,
just before these elecro-pop aﬁ-
cionados embark on a U.S. tour
with the xx (how appropriate).

The group is known for being
pretty secretive, but perhaps as it

continues to project its own brand
of pop — which draws inﬂuences
from everything from Lil Wayne
to Brian Eno — the members of jj
will come out of their shell just
a little bit.

Other artists with early 2010
releases: Spoon, Eels, RJD2, The
Magnetic Fields, Hot Chip, Mas-
sive Attack, The Watson Twins,
David Byrne & Fatboy Slim,
Shout Out Louds, Ted Leo & the
Pharmacists, The White Stripes,
She & Him, Los Campesinos!,
Interpol, LCD Soundsystem,
MGMT, Lil Wayne, and Joanna

Lady Generals on the rise

After dropping to a 2-6 record, W&L women have improved to 6-7

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WR ITER

After struggling through their ﬁrst few
games over Christmas break and bottom-
ing out with a 2-6 record after a tough
48-47 loss to Virginia Wesleyan on Janu-
ary 5th, the women’s basketball team has
turned their season around.

The incredibly young, but also im-
mensely talented, team has struggled to
ﬁnd consistency this season. This problem

W&L has gone 4-1 and put itself right
back in the thick of the ODAC conference
race.

“Our goal from day one has been to
win the ODAC championship and I think
this win streak is just giving us more con-
ﬁdence that we can reach our goal,” said
sophomore forward Becca Bolton.

“Our goal from day one has been to win the ODAC

championship and I think this win streak is just giving

Becca Bolton, sophomore forward

was evidenced during the Surf and Slam
San Diego Hoops Classic over Christmas
Break, where the Generals knocked off a
highly touted Capital University team, but
then were blown out by Pt. Loma Naza-
rene just two days later.

Washington and Lee dropped two more
conference games when they got back, los-
ing to Randolph Macon and Virginia Wes-
leyan. The Wesleyan game was particu-
larly tough to swallow as the Generals lost
48-47 thanks to a buzzer-beating jumper.

The shots just weren’t falling for W&L.
But since the loss to Virginia Wesleyan,

in any of the previous four games, the of-
fense ﬁnally exploded and the talented and
youthful squad lived up to its potential.-
The Generals rattled off three quick wins,
beating Lynchburg (72-52), Randolph
(85-48), and Eastern Mennonite (66-46).

Facing off against Randolph, all 11
players on the Generals squad put them-
selves on the board. The team, led by
sophomore guard Meg Ingram’s 18 points,
also tied a school record for three-pointers
in a game with 12.

The team’s success continued three
days later versus EMU, with four double-

digit scorers for the Gennies and the sec-
ond consecutive game where the team shot
above 45% from the ﬂoor.

On Friday, the team suffered a minor
setback, dropping a close game to Roanoke
by a score of 57-54. Bolton ﬁlled the score
sheet with an impressive double-double,
putting up a solid 15-point, 15-rebound ef-
fort. Sophomore guard Kari Pfannenstein
netted 16 points as well.

On Saturday, the team traveled to
Bridgewater to face off against its seventh
conference foe in a row. The team came
back just in time to enjoy Tear Night ac-
tivities with a satisfying 67-58 win. Bolton
notched her sixth double-double of the
year with 20 points and 18 boards. Junior
forward Felice Herman chipped in with 19
points and 12 rebounds.

“I think we have been playing better
lately because we have ﬁnally learned how
to play together,” Bolton said. “I think it
took us a little while to ﬁgure out how to
play with each other because we are so
young, but it has started clicking lately.”

The surging Generals start off the sec-
ond half of the season with a home game
against Hollins University on Tuesday
night. Tipoff is set for 7 p.m.

Men’s basketball knocked off by a free throw

The Generals fought Roanoke to the buzzer, but couldn ’t pull off the win, losing 60-59

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

Junior gmard Jason Cimino stepped up
when the Generals needed him the most.
Drilling a three-pointer with 16 seconds
left in the men’s showdown against Roa-
noke Saturday night, Cimino tied the score
at 59-59. The Generals looked poised to
charge into their second overtime game of
the week after knocking off conference foe
Lynchburg 63-59 in OT on Wednesday. A
win would have boosted the Generals’ vic-
tory count to 10 and put the team in good
position to continue its quest for an NCAA
tournament berth.

But a lone free throw by the Maroons
kept the Generals (9-5, 2-4) from victory,
and Roanoke defeated W&L 60-59.

The Generals ﬁnished the night making
10-11 free throws while Roanoke dropped
in 11 of 21.

In a game where neither team led by
more than ﬁve points in the ﬁrst half, the
close ﬁnish was a tough pill to swallow.

Roanoke led by only three at the half,
heading into the locker room up 26-23.
But they came out shooting in the second
half and quickly jumped to an 1 1-point lead

with a little under nine minutes left in the
game. The Generals battled back, but their
last minute charge was simply too little,
too late.

Senior forward Ben Goetsch led the
Generals with 16 points and eight rebounds.
Fellow senior forwards Zac White and An-
drew Payne ﬁnished with 12 points and six
rebounds and nine points and six rebounds,
respectively. Cimino ﬁnished with five
points and ﬁve assists.

After setting up a nice three-game win-
ning streak to open their games over Christ-
mas break, the Generals have stumbled in
conference play recently.

The Generals dominated the W&L tour-
nament the ﬁrst week of January, knocking
off Swarthmore 59-48 and Emory 76-65.
But their hot streak met its match when the
team took on Eastern Mennonite three days
later. The 24th-ranked Royals used a 19-
point half time lead to run the Generals out
8348. Tumovers and poor shooting plagued
the Generals as they shot just 32.7 percent
and turned the ball over 23 times.

The Generals’ shooting woes contin-

ued against Virginia Wesleyan as the 12th
ranked Marlins posted a 16-4 run to claim
a 69-64 victory over W&L. The Generals
posted just one ﬁeld goal. Goetsch had a
double-double to lead the Generals with 24
points and 11 rebounds. White added ﬁve
points and 10 boards. F irst-year forward
Taylor Gilﬁllan stepped up with eight points
and three rebounds.

W&L recovered with the overtime
win against Lynchburg. They improved
to 45.6 percent shooting from the ﬂoor
and out-rebounded the Hornets 47-36. But
turnovers continued to be a problem for the
Generals with 29 and they shot a dismal
5-of—l4 from the free throw line.

With the Generals’ next four con-
ference games on the road, they’ll need
to keep their turnovers in check and their
shooting up to stay in play for ODAC title
contention.

The Generals’ next match-up is
against Methodist College at 7:00 p.m. on
Wednesday.

How bad can the Nets get?

The New Jersey Nets have won only three games in a season that “is nothing short of catastrophic ” ‘

By Adam Cancryn
5 TA F F w R i T E R

Can one bad year ruin an entire de-
cade? For the New Jersey Nets, it is quite
a possibility.

The Nets are slogging through an NBA
season that is nothing short of catastroph-
ic. They are last in the league in defense,
25.5 games out of ﬁrst, perpetually injured
and already on their third head coach in
four months. The result is a pathetically
abysmal record of 3-36.

There are few organizations in the
sporting world that have ever been this
bad. Major League Baseball’s New York
Mets went 40-120 in their inaugural sea-
son. But even as the game’s benchmark of
ineptitude, the Mets still won 25 percent
of their games.

The Nets? 7.9 percent.

Then there’s the woeful Detroit Lions
of 2008. They were routinely embarrassed
on both sides of the ball, by opponents and
themselves. One of the team’s few high-
lights is quarterback Dan Orlovsky unwit-
tingly running out of the back of his own
end zone to avoid pressure. Needless to
say, the Lions went the entire season with-
out a victory.

But at least in Detroit there was a ray
of hope. Calvin Johnson, a freakishly built
second-year player, established himself as
a top 10 receiver despite catching passes
from ﬁve equally dreadful passers.

All the Nets have to offer on their team
of oft-injured underachievers is center
Brook Lopez. While he’s a solid player,
nothing short of the second coming of Pat-

rick Ewing can save this season.

And although the Lions were at least
assured the No. 1 pick in the subsequent
draft, the Nets hold no such certainty.
True, they will have the best chance in the
NBA’s lottery-style draft, but only four
times in the past 24 years has_ the league’s
worst team won the top pick.

There are a number of other teams
across the athletic spectrum that were
similarly bad. But few, if any, found them-
selves with so many things going wrong all
at once. Aside from the irreparably dam-
aged product on the court, the franchise is
the ﬁnancial equivalent of a sinking ship.
Even before this year, the Nets consistent-
ly ranked in the bottom ﬁve in attendance
and were slotted 26 out of 30 this year in
total franchise value by Forbes.

Now pile on a once-lucrative plan to
move to Brooklyn that currently sits dead
in the water. And then add to that a new
owner, Mikhail Prokhorov, who happens
to have connections to the Russian mob.

It’s a sad situation that will unfortu-
nately overshadow what was the Nets’
most successful decade since the 1970s.

Aided by the arrival of perennial all-
star Jason Kidd and rookie Richard Jef-
ferson in 2001, the team engineered a
26—game turnaround, ﬁnishing 56-30 and
reaching the NBA Finals. Vince Carter
joined a couple years later, establishing
the pre-Celtics version of the Big Three.
Only the dominance of the Western Con-
ference prevented a Nets’ Finals victory.

Nine years into the decade, the Nets
had established themselves as more than
just that team across the river. They racked
up 348 wins, six straight playoff appear-
ances, four ﬁrst place ﬁnishes and played
in two ﬁnals.

But those accomplishments have been
smothered by the stench emanating from
this season, a stench likely to go down as
the worst in history.

Through 39 games, the Nets have just
three victories, putting them on pace for
a ﬁnal record of 6-76. That would eclipse
the previous worst of 9-73 established
by the Philadelphia 76ers in 1973. New
Jersey already owns the league mark for
consecutive losses to open a season, with
18. When coach Lawrence Frank was ﬁred
at 0-16, it seemed like more of a favor to
Frank than to the team.

Unfortunately, the recovery will not
occur as quickly as the demise. Like ev-
erything else that has collapsed in the 21st
century, it will take time. A No.1 pick and
the rights to precocious point guard John
Wall would help. So would a major free
agent signing like Dwyane Wade, Chris
Bosh or LeBron James. But none of that
is certain and each loss seemingly pushes
the idea of a speedy revival farther from
grasp.

In a year that turned the Nets’ trium-
phant ‘Aughts into the sickening Aint’s,
we can be sure of only one thing: it has to
be better next year. Doesn’t it?

Low stats
despite risks

W&L shows more responsible
behavior on infamous Tear
Night this year I -

By Killeen King
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee students took safety more
seriously on Tear Night this year than they have in
the past.

Tear Night, which fell on Jan. 16, is the night where
students celebrate joining their respective Greek or-
ganizations. It has traditionally been one of the most
excessive drinking occasions for W&L students.
Because of this, Lexington Police and the Student
Health Center consider Tear Night one of the most
dangerous nights for students. But this year turned
out better than past years.

Lexington Police LieutenantA. M. Miller said that
police arrested no students on Tear Night this year.

The Student Health Center had 20 percent fewer
alcohol-related visits this Tear Night than they had last
year, according to Doctor Jane Horton.

“The largest decline was in visits by male stu-
dents—they were down by two-thirds,” said Horton.

Fewer students visited the ER and fewer students
stayed in the health center overnight, said Horton.
There was also a lower BAC average this year com-

“Those consequences are pre-
ventable students... did not
make drinking choices that are
diﬂerent... because they are
celebrating new members
joining a fraterntiy or sorority. ”

DR. JANE HORTON, director of the student
health center

pared to last year.

But, not all ofthe statistics were down. According
to Horton, more female students visited the health
center this Tear Night. 7

Both Horton and Miller agree that Tear Night
remains a high-risk event and that students should be
more aware of the dangers.

Miller said that he usually sends out an extra po-
liceman on Tear Night. This sixth policeman serves
as a safety precaution. But Tear Night is not the worst
night for Lexington police.

“Our worst nights are Homecoming and Alumni
Weekends,” said Miller.

When asked what is the best way to control ex-
cessive alcohol consumption on Tear Night, Miller
responded, “People need to be held accountable for
the things they do when they are intoxicated.”

The school the policemen can only do so much.
Students need to take responsibility for their own ac-
tions and for each other’s actions said Miller.

Miller said that he understands that alcohol is a big
part ofthe W&L social scene. “We are not telling you
not to drink; we are telling you to drink responsibly,”
he said.

Horton also acknowledged that alcohol encom-
passes a large part of the social scene and that on
Tear Night students consume even more alcohol than
normal.

“Students in general, and particularly ﬁrst-year
and female students, have an increased risk of expe-
riencing negative health consequences from overuse
of alcohol,” said Horton.

Horton explained that negative health consequences
include vomiting, blacking out, injury and unintended
or unprotected sexual intercourse.

“All ofthose consequences are preventable if stu-
dents would choose to follow lower-risk guidelines
for alcohol use and did not make drinking choices that
are different from how they usually drink just because
they are celebrating new membersjoining a fraternity’
or sorority,” said Horton.

The police and the school cannot ﬁx the excessive
drinking problem, said Miller. It needs to come from
the students themselves. The problem can only be fully
addressed when students step up to the plate and take
responsibility.

Several student groups have gath-
ered to raise funds for the three
million residents affected by the 7.0
magnitude earthquake that struck the
coast of Haiti nearly two weeks ago.

Though poverty is not a new prob-
lem for Haiti, the natural disaster has
shed light on the ongoing crisis and
brought poverty to the attention of
organizations and individuals around
the world.

At Washington and Lee, students
have created an ad hoc group for the
purpose of raising funds to relieve
Haitian distress.

Though some of these students
belong to other organizations that
are dedicated to the united front of
social justice, diversity, or commu-
nity service, students have put their
particular interests aside to focus on
a single cause.

The group, called Change for
Haiti, gathers students from organiza-
tions such as the Caribbean Society,
the Bonner Leaders Program, the
Nabors Service.League, the Multi-
cultural Student Association (MSA),
Action Change Tomorrow (ACT),
Amnesty lntemational, Hillel, and the
StudentAssociation for International
Learning (SAIL).

Caitlin Edgar, who is a member
of the Bonner Leaders Program,
said: “We no longer live in an insular
world. What affects our neighboring
nations affects us. In addition, any
harm or devastation caused to another
human heart, mind or body should
elicit the same level of concern from
us as ifthey were ourselves.”

The group began its fundraising at
the Martin Luther King keynote ad-
dress by placing donation receptacles

at the security desk, the Cafe 77 regis-
ter and the bookstore. Since then, the
group has already raised $400.
However, the students are not
stopping at $400. Change for Haiti is

V holding a rafﬁe, planning a luncheon,

and a benefit concert.

The majority of funds that are
raised will be donated to a large
organization that, according to Sum-
mer Sterling, a member of ACT,
will be “a well-known, reputable
organization.”Some funds may go to

sell over I00 shirts, raising around
$700. The t-shirts are donated by
University T’s, and the proceeds
will go to the organization to which
Change for Haiti chooses to do-
nate.

One of the organizations that
the group is considering is Haitian
Health Foundation, founded by
Professor Charles Lowney’s uncle,
an orthodontist who works with
volunteers to help Haitian orphans.
Lowney’s uncle built a hospital that

“We no longer live in an insular world. What af-
fects our neighboring nations affects us. In addi-
tion, any harm or devastation caused to another
human  should elicit the same level of concern
from us as if they were ourselves. ”

smaller organizations as well.

Studens are also selling rafﬁe tick-
ets to raise money for the Haiti relief
fund in the Commons, the Market-
place and the-Atrium. Ticket sales be-
gin today. Prizes include Fancy Dress
tickets, gift cards to local businesses
including Sweet Things, and an iPod
Shuffle donated by MSA.

Dennis Fowler, Assistant Director
of Operations of the Marketplace,
has organized a benefit luncheon.
For every person who eats lunch at
the Marketplace this Friday, January
29, between ll:30 and 2:00, $3 will
be donated to the Haiti relief fund.
Fowler expects a minimum of 500
diners, raising at least $1500.

Change for Haiti is expecting to

serves over 225,000 patients a year,
and, brings healthcare to villages
via Jeeps.

The foundation also helps local
families become more independent
by raising money to buy goats and
building “happy homes,” cardboard
shelters for the families. After the
earthquake, nearly 1.5 million
people were displaced and the group
has already begun to ration supplies
and food.

Yet Lowney sees hope in the
disaster in Haiti.

Celebrating a legacy

Along with MLK day, W&L remembers the civil rights hero in a week-long series of events

By Chelsea Stevenson
STAFF WRITER

Members of the Washington I

and Lee law, undergraduate and
Rockbridge area communities col-
laborated in putting together a series
of events in honor of Martin Luther
King, Jr.

The past two weeks at W&L have
consisted of keynote speakers, ﬁlms,
a community service project and
even a birthday party.

The series of events started off
with a showing of the 2004 film
“Crash,” on Tuesday, Jan. 12.

The ﬁlm, starring Sandra Bullock,
focuses on tolerance, acceptance and
racism: all causes for which King
fought.

According to Dean Tamara F utrell,
chairman ofthe Martin Luther King
planning committee, interracial
equality is still a struggle in today’s
community and the ﬁlm properly il-
lustrates this issue.

The second event of the week was
a community service project that took
place on Saturday, Jan. 16.

People throughout the community
donated school supplies to the Rock-
bridge Middle School, in celebration
of King’s passion for education.

School supplies such as protrac-
tors, compasses and glue sticks were
requested out of need, but all supplies
were graciously welcomed.

Following the community service that still exist in our society, even

project, there was a keynote speaker
on Sunday, Jan. l7. -

Julian Bond, the chairman of the
NAACP (National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People)
and a student of Martin Luther King,
gave the keynote address to the com-
munity in Lee Chapel.

Bond founded the Student Non-
violent Coordinating Committee
(SNCC) in 1960 and was an activist
during the Civil Rights movement.

He discussed several of his ex-
periences in his speech, “The Road
to the Dream: from Alabama to
Obama.” His speech addressed issues

with Obama’s inauguration.

Exposing the terror of torture

New Yorker staﬂ writer, Jane Mayer, speaks out against American use of alternative methods to interrogate detainees

By Victoria Taylor
STAFF WRITER

Jane Mayer appeared at ease.
Sitting comfortably and conﬁdent
on the Stackhouse stage, the New
Yorker staff writer answered ques-
tions Thursday about a topic that
causes many to cringe: the United
States’ dealings with torture.

Mayer has done the legwork to
merit discussing such a polarizing
topic with poise.

She addresses the matter in
her newest book, “The Dark Side:
The Inside Story of How the War
on Terror Turned into a War on
American Ideals.”

In the book, she looks at the
American military and CIA7s use
of techniques like water-boarding,
stress positions and sleep depriva-
tion against prisoners.

In the aftermath of the 9/ 11
terrorist attacks, Mayer said, Vice
President Dick Cheney and his

adviser David Addington took the -

opportunity to further an agenda
to augment presidential powers.
She said the new interrogation
methods being used in the War on
Terror raised questions on what

constitutes severe punishment.

“The United States doesn’t
have a lot of history of purposely
torturing people,” she said.

“We haven’t spent a lot of time
ﬁguring out how many ﬁngernails
we can or cannot pull out of
someone.”

Mayer said she found that

contlnued from page 1

Futrell wished that more W&L
students had attended the speaker
‘because the majority of the sup-
port was from local residents.

However Amber King, a soph-
omore and member of the Martin
Luther King planning committee,
not only attended but was given
the opportunity to introduce Bond
before his speech.

“I got to have dinner with him
prior to the event and he is a very
down-to-earth person,” said Coo-
per on her impression of Bond.

Cooper became involved with
the planning committee for Mar-
tin Luther King through her em-

Lexington police shell out too many parking tickets

Now in his fourth year dealing with the daily frustrations of two hour parking,

By James Baird
COLUMNIST

Dear Lexington Police De-
partment,

I am writing this letter to in-
form you of my absolute joy at
receiving two parking citations
over the span of ﬁve business
days.

However, in my current state
of ecstasy, I would like to bring
to your attention a number of
recommendations and, some
might say, criticisms ofthe man-
ner in which these lovely letters
of happiness are issued.

I would like to preface this
tirade by saying that I live off-
campus in a house that is over a
mile away. from the university,
and although I do own a bicycle
and am a rabid environmentalist,
I drive my Tahoe to class on a
daily basis unless it’s warm and
the sun is shining. "

The parking situation is grim.
In the uncommon event there is
an open spot in the Red Square
lot near Beta (capacity: fewer
than 30 vehicles), I park there
and breathe a sigh of relief.

Otherwise, I am faced with an
unfortunate dilemma. Do I drive
around the block and look for a
spot on the street, or do I park in
the university’s parking garage?

Should I choose the former, I
run the risk ofﬁnding a cute neon
green envelope stamped VIOLA-
TION in sickeningly large and
official font tucked neatly under
my windshield wiper upon ﬁn-
ishing class.

Should I choose the latter,
I am forced to walk half a mile
to get to the fraternity house, a
walk I will have to make since I
eat breakfast at the house every
morning.

One hundred percent of the
time I choose to risk the ticket in
hopes it will outweigh the cost of
the time it takes to walk to and
from the parking garage.

When I do receive a ticket, I
take issue for a speciﬁc reason.
Every violation I have received
has been issued while my car is
parked in one of the spots around
Red Square.

This includes and is limited
to the tail end of Main Street (in
front of PIKA) and West Henry
Street (in front of Phi Delt). The
signs are pretty clear: two hour
parking Monday through Friday
during peak business hours, but
who on God’s green earth is go-

around that area. There is Stop-
In (with its own abnormally large
parking lot that is never full), the
Patisserie (also with its own lot)
and that model shop (surprise! It
has a lot, too). Have I ever seen
any of those lots ﬁlled in over
three years that I’ve attended this

parking might be a good idea in the mid-
dle of Main Street (by the Southern Inn,

say), but around Red Square? Give me a

break.

ington and Lee students and/or
fraternity employees? Answer:
no one.

Let’s examine the businesses

school? Nope. Have they ever

been ﬁlled? Not likely. There-
fore, customers of those busi-
nesses do not park on the street
and do not need those spaces.

I can certainly understand
why two-hour parking might be a
good idea in the middle of Main
Street (by the Southern Inn, say),
but around Red Square? Give me
a break.

The people awarded those
tickets are almost exclusively
students, and guess what? Stu-
dents have class! I, and others,
don’t try to leave our vehicles
on the street for more than two
hours, but I, and others, have at
least two consecutive hours of
class ﬁve days a week. Unfortu-
nately I’m not the type to walk
out ofclass and down the hill to
move my ear.

Dear Lexington police, here's
a grand idea: how about you of-
fer W&L students parking pass-
es to park in areas around the
fraternity houses and academic
buildings for six or 12 hours at a
time at a one-time rate.

Granted, you do offer a
“Hunting Pass Parking Program”
(random name, by the way), but
oh wait, there is a waiting list,

James Baird releases his frustration

among other things (see: www.
ci.lexington.va.us/parkhunt.
htm).

It will save you time and
manpower, but you might be out
a few thousand dollars a year
(maybe you could sell one of
your Chargers to fill that hole).
Oh, and it will be good for public
relations, something with which
you usually struggle. I appreci-
ate the job your department per-
forms, but when I walk down the
street and see green slips left and
right, I can see why students get
frustrated.

Jews are accepted and embraced at Washington andLee

After hearing about alleged intolerance, a law student commends the religious outreach and support for his faith

By Jordan Rothman
C0 LUM N I ST

I have wanted to attend Wash-
ington and Lee for a long time. I
remember reading about Robert
E. Lee and discovering that he
was the president of a southern
college after the Civil War.

I later researched this institu-
tion, and became increasingly
enamored with W&L.

Yet, there was one problem. I
am Jewish and come from a fam-
ily that values a strong connec-
tion to the Jewish community.
My parents did not think that
W&L had a vibrant Jewish pres-
ence, and this perceived absence
was one of the reasons why my
folks pressured me to attend a
different undergraduate institu-
tion.

Nevertheless, I have been
extremely satisﬁed with my re-
ligious experiences here at W&L
and through the great work of
Hillel, I have become closer to
my faith. Additionally, by be-
ing in the minority, the Jewish
community on this campus is as
vibrant and strong as anywhere
else.

Last May, I graduated from
Brandeis University. Brandeis is
a Jewish-sponsored university in
Waltham, Mass., and the insti-
tution purports to promote the
principles of social justice and

progressivism.

Over 50 percent of the stu-
dents at Brandeis are Jewish,
the university closes for Jewish
holidays, and the institution has
close afﬁliations with many Jew-
ish causes. At Brandeis, one can
become really disillusioned with
one’s faith, as a Jewish presence
is omnipresent, and it is easy to
take this presence for granted.

are just fewer of us at W&L.
This has led us to proactively
seek out and spend time with
other Jewish students, and Hillel
helps facilitate this interaction.
The Hillel here is in a lot of
ways more effective at connect-
ing Jews with their religious tra-
ditions than Jewish organizations
at other colleges. At‘Brand,eis,
for instance, Shabbat dinners are

“I laugh now when I recall that some of

my ﬁriends and family members told me
before I came to W&L that I should not

wear a Star of David on campus, or do

anything to attract attention to my reli-

gious beliefs. _

_ 

One can become overwhelmed
by the Jewish atmosphere on
campus.

At W&L, Jews are in the mi-
nority, and this has positive ef-
fects on one’s Jewish experience.
The Jews here seem much more
closely bonded than those at
Brandeis, because frankly there

massive events that include hun-
dreds of people. Here, it is much
smaller affair, but this leads to a
generally much more personal
experience.

Shabbat dinner at W&L is
one of the most beautiful events
I have ever been to. Students
and faculty from W&L make

up most of the participants, but
many VMI cadets and local fam-
ilies are also in attendance. This
has the effect ofuniting the local
Jewish community, and allowing
all of us the opportunity to share
our traditions with other Jews in
the area.

I am so fond of this monthly
event and other experiences,
that I would advise any Jewish
people I know to attend this in-
stitution. Enrolling at W&L can
have the effect of drawing Jew-
ish youth closer to their faith,
and also allows one the opportu-
nity to become part of a unique
community.

Furthermore, the W&L ad-
ministration greatly supports
Jewish students. For instance,
the university strongly contrib-
uted to the construction of a
Hillel House, and this support is
one ofthe reasons I felt comfort-
able coming to W&L in the ﬁrst
place.

Additionally, a menorah was
displayed in the Commons liv-
ing room during the holidays,
and none of the greetings issued
by our university during that
season excluded Jews.

Furthermore, the institution
doesn’t seem to exclusively sup-
port any one faith, even though

Supreme Court decision to allow unlimited political donations is wrong

By Summer Lollie
COLU M NIST

I’m afraid of what American
democracy will look like af-
ter the dust settles on Supreme
Court’s ruling last Thursday al-
lowing corporations the right
to spend an inﬁnite amount of
money to inﬂuence the outcome
of elections.

Five of the nine Supreme
Court Justices ruled that corpo-
rations were “persons” with the
right to free speech. Further, the
court cited the equally reprehen-
sible 1976 Supreme Court Case
Buckley v. Valeo decision that
equated money with speech.

This decision means that
corporations, as “persons,” can
pump an inﬁnite amount of
money into our political system
that is already strangled by cor-
porate interests.

The glaring irrationality be-
hind the Supreme Court’s de-
cision leaves me breathless. If
money equals speech_and more
money equals more speech, then
“persons” with more money
have more speech. And doesn’t
that undermine the very princi-
ple of free speech?

Due to the absurd cost of me-

dia exposure for campaigns, we
already have a representative
government beholden to corpo-
rate interests. Enabling corpora-
tions to spend an inﬁnite amount

Let us not forget that with

the university has some deep re-
ligious roots.

I would also like to note that
the W&L community (in my
case, more like the W&L Law
community) has really helped
me feel welcome here despite
my different religious beliefs.

Many of my colleagues at the
law school share Yiddish expres-
sions with me, while others c_ome
to Hillel-sponsored events. Yet
others seem genuinely interested
in Jewish traditions, and one of
my non—Jewish friends even had
a festive Chanukah patty com-
plete with latkes and donuts in
order to celebrate the holiday.

Furthermore, I have never
been discriminated against at
W&L, and have never felt dif-
ferent because of my religion.
I laugh now when I recall that
some of my friends and family
members told me before I came
to W&L that I should not wear a
Star of David on campus, or do
anything to attract attention to
my religious beliefs.

This advice seems almost
comical to me now, as my expe-
rience here has perhaps had the
effect of making me more proud
of my ethnic and religious back-
ground.

I therefore express my Jewish

identity more at W&L than I have
at any other point in my life, as
the community here seems en-
tirely supportive and welcoming
of my religious beliefs.

Overall, I have had a fantastic
religious experience so far here
at W&L. Primarily, this is due to
the hardworking people at W&L
Hillel, who have created a wide
range of programs which bond '
Jewish students together and
draw us all closer to our faith.

But also, I have had such a
great experience thus far due to
the nature of W&L‘s welcoming
community. People here have
been wonderful, and due to this
support, I have had a fantastic
religious experience as a student
here at W&L.

Elections shows Senator Brown is a true “game changer”

The result of last weeks Massachusetts senatorial election means no Democrat in any seat is safe this year

By Jarett Brotzman
COLU MNIST

Last Tuesday, underdog Re-
publican Scott Brown was elect-
ed to the Senate seat formally
held by Senator Ted Kennedy.
The ﬁrst Republican to be _elect-
ed a senator from Massachusetts
since 1972, Brown’s election sent
out the message by Massachu-
setts that “We want change, but
not the kind of change that Presi-
dent Obama is pushing for.”

These results are certainly
dramatic. In November 2008,’
Obama took Massachusetts with
a 26-point lead over John Mc-
Cain. On Jan. 19, Martha Coke-
ly, endorsed by Obama, lost by
around 5-points. If the election is
any measure of the popularity of
President Obama and his agenda,
the 31-point shift is something
to be concerned about for the
Democrats.

But beyond the numbers of
the election, what does the elec-
tion of Senator Brown in Ted
Kennedy’s seat really mean‘?

A lot.

Initially, this election will
have a dramatic effect on the per-

ceived prospects of candidates
for November, both Republican
and Democrat.

On the Republican side, can-
didates and supporters will have
a renewed interest in elections
that perhaps seemed unobtain-
able just a month earlier. There
will be an increased interest of

temporary shift by the growing
and ever-ﬁckle independent vot-
ers. Incumbent Democrats, po-
tentially facing for the ﬁrst time
a viable Republican challenger,
might decide that retirement and
the beach houses that are waiting

for them seem pretty appealing
right now. _

It also seems that the Mas-
sachusetts election of Senator
Brown is a certain rejection of
many policies pursued by the
Obama administration. Senator
Brown has been quoted as say-
ing:

“I ’ve criticized President Bush
for his failure to use his veto pen.
There’s plenty of blame to go
around. The question is how to
solve problems. lt’s not bailouts.
What made America great? Free
markets, free enterprise, manu-
facturing, job creation. That’s
how we’re gonna do it, not by
enlarging government.” (WSJ,
Jan. 22)

Senator Brown seems to be
rejecting both the large growth
of debt and government by both
President Bush and Obama. In
Washington, this will take the
form of opposition to “Obam-
aCare,” card checks for unions
and the cap-and-trade energy tax
in its current form. While some
of this opposition is ideological,

such as his position on “Obam-
aCare,” Brown seems to oppose
large increases in spending from
wherever they come from.

But Brown, a liberal Republi-
can by most measures and a self-
described “Scott Brown Repub-

lican,” is not opposed to all of

President Obama’s policies and
seeks to be a consensus builder,
not ideological roadblock.

He agrees that the situation
inherited by the Obama White
House is far from ideal, and

believes that President Obama

has taken the advice of General
McCrystal- in Afghanistan and is
doing a “great job” with North
Korea.

Another potential area of con-
sensus between the Obama Ad-
ministration and Senator Brown
could be new initiatives in edu-
cational policy promoting char-
ter schools and merit-based pay.

The implications of this elec-
tion are tough to measure so soon
afterward, but the long-term ef-
fects on Senator Brown’s elec-
tion will certainly go beyond the

 

ability to ﬁlibuster.

Brown seems to ﬁt the type of
workhorse politician—one who
will make the best of a situation
and not fall victim to political
overreach in light of the recent
victory.

But the real lesson from last
Tuesday is that if a Republican
can take Ted Kennedy’s Sen-
ate seat in Massachusetts, no
Democrat in any seat across the

country is safe from Republican '

assault in November.

were ineffectual and were not
needed in such prevalence.

It is important ﬁrst to rec-
ognize the signiﬁcance of the
articles, which were submitted
by survivors of rape on W&L’s
campus to show that rape and
sexual assault do in fact happen
on campus more often than we
would like to realize.

They were necessary in prev-
alence ﬁrst to show the gravity of
the situation, but also because it
is hard to get a message across
comprehensively when people
tend not to read Campus Notices
or pay that much attention to
other reminders or postings on
billboards.

I think that your argument
that the “frequent and graphic”
stories around campus (not just
in the men’s bathrooms, as you
seem to imply) leading to only
talking about the frequent and
graphic stories shows not that the
stories are wrong, but that people
on campus are too apathetic to
actually be concerned with the
issue.

It is much easier to argue
about the validity of the stories
and write about why you think
that End It has misled the cam-

pus than how terrible it is that
these stories and many others
have occurred on our “campus of
honor”

I am tired of people saying
that “sexual assault is a problem,
but...” and then stating what
the group trying to stop it has
done wrong, rather than what
the writer personally could do to

If people do not want action
from the problems that you your-
self stated are very real, then
that shows campus apathy, but
it doesn’t show that End It was

,,_wrong in posting those stories.

 I recognize that there is a
need for more “gentle” activism
on campus, but I disagree with
the idea that strategies like the

Rape doesn ’t happen

in public, on Trav-

eller or on the dance ﬂoor, and... if your

friends or other guys

have committed a

rape, they arenot going to say, “oh yeah,

that was me. ” ‘

stop sexual assault on a personal
level.

On that note, of course not all
W&L men are rapists. However,
some men are and they are frater-
nity brothers or fellow students
or people who are supposed to
believe in a system of respect.

I would also like to note that
rape doesn’t happen in public, on
Traveller or on the dance ﬂoor,
and that if your friends or other
guys have committed a rape,
they are not going to say, “oh
yeah, that was me.”

Red Flag Campaign are the way
to go.

The problem with the Red
Flag Campaign, organizations
like SPEAK and I in 4, or any
other strategy that we have tried
on campus is the fact that they
have been tried and that sexual
assault rates have not gone down
yet.

This data is reflected inour
rotating CORE and NCHA data,
both of which are reliable, non-
biased surveys not speciﬁcally
based on sexual assault or other

“leading” topics (which some
have argued could account for
the high statistics).

Furthermore, Red Flag Cam-
paign posters might be showing
appropriate situations that you
mentioned, but they are removed
in that people don’t really con-
nect them to their own lives, not
to mention the fact that every
year, we still have over twice
the national average of reported
sexual assaults for both women
and men.

I have never heard anyone
discuss them as you have al-
leged, but I have seen plenty of
people laugh at them because of
the somewhat cliche instances
given. I think that W&L women
sharing their W&L stories makes
the campaign very personal in a
way that another organization’s
poster cannot.

Maybe instead of denying the
reality, you could be struck with
the pain that at least one student
had to go through and dedicate
yourself to stopping the occur-
rence from happening to any
woman on campus.

Sincerely,
Catherine Kruse

University is prepared for emergencies

Dean of Students responds to article that mistakenly claimed the administration

did not have a plan to help stranded students after December is snowstorm

Dear Editor,

I write in response to the
Jan. 18 article, “Stranded in the
snow.” I write to clarify some in-
formation in the piece

In the beginning of the sec-
ond paragraph, the article reads:
“The University did not have
any plan to deal with the situa-
tion.”

The article goes on to ex-
plain the communication before
and during the storm, how the
sidewalks were maintained and
roads re-opened as quickly as
possible and how dining was re-
opened.

' All of those steps are a part
of Emergency Management
Plan that was actualized during
the storm. In addition, there was
reference made to a lack of food
for a few days.

In fact, on Saturday, students
were sent a communication

about restaurants open within
walking distance of campus
while we re-opened dining by
Sunday morning. Re-opening
dining was no small feat. Food

we were unable to respond to

were students who lived off
campus requesting that the Uni-
versity clear their drives how-
ever we were in touch with land-
lords urging removal of snow as
quickly as possible.

My purpose in writing this
is to assure students who were
stranded that we were thinking
of you, using our Emergency

we could to respond to the “larg-

 W&L senior publishes online novel

Abel Delgado is coming-of-age story about a young Cuban—American girl in Miami is now available for download

By Katie Boe
STAFF WRITER

V 0 t hestg

 

  

Not many college students can
boast completing a novel before
graduation, but Washington and
Lee senior Abel Delgado can. On
top of preparations to either attend
law school next year or work for
a non-govemmental organization,
Delgado has successfully written
a genuine and heartfelt coming-of-
age story featuring a 14 year-old
girl as the protagonist.

His novel, “Other Half,” is
available on the Internet and has
received more than a thousand
downloads.

The novel addresses the typical
issues that adolescents and young

adults have long struggled with.

The protagonist, Alethia, does
not believe in love and through a
creative writing assignment learns
to appreciate and believe in the
power of love. In her assignment,
she tells the story of her family
friends, Angel and Crystal, and
how they fell in love more than
ten years ago.

The book looks promising a"'‘ *

is certainly a “feel-good,” quick
read. It seems to appeal to a slight-
ly younger set than college-:.ge,
and would probably be catego-
rized as a young-adult novel.

Nonetheless, “Other Half’ is
a cute story that allows the reader
to connect" and empathize with the
characters.

and analyzing people, their per-
sonalities and the relationships
they have with each other.”
Delgado took much of his
plot from his own experiences in
high_school, and simply exagger-
ated them to embellish the story.
Even more, a signiﬁcant portion
of the novel’s dialogue “come[s]
directly from conversations I had

explained.

process any less difficult. Del-
gado experienced writer’s block
at times, but to combat it he never
forced himself to write. He also
found that he wrote best and most
ﬂuidly late at night, around mid-
night. By writing the novel in this
manner, he found that a lot of the
book wrote itself.

Finally, last summer, Delgado

was conﬁdent and pleased enough
with his work that he released the

This first draft was titled
“Firsts,” but was completely re-
written a year later. Since the
primary re-writing, Delgado has
done more re-writes, additions
and edits until his work became
what it is now. Delgado said that
“re-writing was probably the most
difficult part.”

He also struggled with writing
from the perspective of a female
protagonist. To accurately and
genuinely create a female voice,
Delgado asked many of his female

novel to the public via the Internet.
Once the book hits between 5,000
to 10,000 downloads, and Del-
gado has received more feedback,
he will pursue literary agents and
publishers.

Should his first novel be pub-
lished, Delgado plans to write four
more novels as a series. While he
has not started to formally write
the next book in his series, he has
outlined and planned the next in-
stallment.

aking dance to the Twitterverse

The W&L Repertory Dance Company is technology-themed show uses micro—blogging to reach audience

By Stephanie Hardiman
ARTS & LIFE emroa

There aren’t many ‘times
that it’s okay to use your phone
during a performance. But the
Washington and Lee Repertory
Dance Company aims to change
that-.

For this year’s dance perfor-
mance, debuting on Thursday
night, audience members can
follow the show on Twitter to
get updates about the choreog-
raphers, dancers and the pieces
they perform.

“A lot of times, the dance
audience feels excluded,” said
Jenefer Davies, the company’s
artistic director. “They have to
ﬁgure out what’s going on. It’s
my attempt to create a more in-
clusive environment.”

Davies said that dance is
naturally very abstract and lends
itself to further explanation.
Tweeting to the audience will
help them engage in a new way,
she hopes.

Junior David Doobin will
be in the audience tweeting
via @WLUdanceconcert. Da-
vies hopes the audience will be
watching the show and getting
the inside scoop on the behind-
the-scenes information from
Twitter.

But Twitter is just the begin-
ning of what emerged as a tech-
nology-themed show.

Guest choreographer Bill
Meadows created a dance using
Nintendo’s Wii game console
remotes.

The “Wiimotes” are pro-
grammed to interface with a
special computer that creates
sounds depending on the danc-
ers’ movements. Dancers will
carry or wear the Wiimotes “to

create their own accompani-

ment,” Davies said.

Kevin Remington, W&L’s
photographer, is even involved
with a piece. A photo shoot of
dancers participating in an un-
derwater wedding will be pro-
jected on a giant screen while
senior Sophie Xiong improvises
a dance below it.

“In general, artists are look-
ing for ways to incorporate tech-
nology. It’s so easy to access . . .
it makes it more visually appeal-
ing,” Davies said.

Thirty-two students are in-
volved in the performance, with
another 15 working backstage.

Six guest choreographers, in- .

cluding 1991 alumna Sharon
Witting, two faculty members
and 11 student choreographers

The dances run the style

either of those two records, the

like a sea change.

Generals win one, lose one on the road

Men s basketball took a close victory over Methodist University, but couldn ’t rally to beat Hampden-Sydney; now 10-6 '

By Hank Nathan
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee men’s bas-
ketball team split its road games this
past week with a 59-53 win against
Methodist University and a 73-66 loss
to Hampden-Sydney College, resulting
in a 10-6 overall record.

The Generals opened the week with
a 59-53 win over Methodist on Wednes-
day. W&L started out fast to a 7-0 lead
capped by a three-pointer by senior for-
ward Zac White. The team continued to
build its lead on a dunk by senior for-

‘ ward Ben Goetsch who scored on a fast

break off of an assist by junior guard
Jason Cimino.

This play made the score 17-6 with
7:52 remaining in the ﬁrst half. The
Monarchs made a small dent in the Gen-
erals’ lead before the end of the half, and
the score was 23-16 at the break.

W&L came out on ﬁre in the second
frame and continued to build their lead.
In the ﬁrst six minutes of the second
half, the Generals went on a 14-4 run to
create a 37-20 lead.

During the run, senior forward An-
drew Payne added in seven points, in-
cluding an and-one layup. The squad’s
biggest lead in the game was 18 on two
foul shots by Payne with 9:48 to go in
the contest.

However, the Monarchs were unde-
terred by the large margin and began to
chip away at the Generals’ lead.

Following the 48-30 score, Method-
ist went on an 18-4 run and cut the lead
down to four points at 52-48 with 1:21
remaining. Despite only scoring from
the ﬁeld once in the last 11:17 of the
contest, W&L managed to convert on

“We didn’t have a ﬁeld goal in the last
11 minutes, but we didn’t panic.”

Also in the effort, Goetsch and Payne
combined for 21 points, while Cimino
tallied nine points, six boards and four
assists.

The game against Methodist marked
the ﬁnal out-of-conference game for
W&L this season. The squad will now

at 59-53.

In the face of a comeback attempt by
the Monarchs, the Generals kept their
composure in the waning moments of
the game, said White.

“I think we reacted with poise down
the stretch,” said White who tied a
game-high in scoring with 13 points.

face 10 straight conference games.
Now that every game is in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference, games
will become more intense, said Cimino.
“Conference games are a grind,”
said Cimino. “It seems like every game
in the ODAC comes down to one of the
ﬁnal possessions. The key to winning
conference games is focus. Every play

could be the one that wins or loses the
game, and I think we are ﬁnally starting
to ﬁgure that out heading into the home-
stretch of the season.”

Unfortunately, momentum was short-
lived after the victory against Methodist,
as W&L lost 73-66 to Hampden-Sydney
on Saturday.

The game was back-and-forth in
the ﬁrst half andlneither team had a
lead greater than seven points. Goetsch
opened up the scoring for the Generals
with a dunk on a backdoor feed by ﬁrst-
year Taylor Gilﬁllan. He then followed
that with a three-pointer .from the top of
the arc.

Additionally, ﬁrst-year Kelton Bu-
chanan provided two three-pointers off
the bench, but W&L still trailed 29-34
at half.

At the beginning of the second half,
Hampden-Sydney came out of the gate
fast and went on a 23-10 run to build
a 57-39 advantage. The Generals im-
mediately countered with a 10-0 run of
their own and slashed the lead to eight
with 7:53 to play. W&L continued to cut
into the Tigers’ lead on a shot from be-
yond the arc by White, a driving shot by
Cimino and a layup by ﬁrst-year JD Ey.

The Generals cut the score to 60-62

in favor of Hampden-Sydney with 3:35
remaining. However, the 2-point margin
was as close as the Generals would get,
as they fell 66-73.

In the contest, White led W&L in
scoring with 15 points, and added in ﬁve
rebounds. Goetsch and Payne combined
for 23 points, and Ey scored seven off
the bench.

Approaching the halfway point in
the season, the W&L men’s basketball
team will focus turning tough losses to
schools like Hampden Sydney into vic-
tories.

“There is always room for improve-
ment,” said Cimino. “We need to play
harder and be more focused. If you look
at our record and even stretches during
games, the lack of effort and focus have
hurt us. We are starting to improve that,
and are becoming more dangerous ev-
ery game.”

we are going in to conferences,” sopho-
more Katie Salvati said. “Some people

On the men’s side, the double-dual
meet turned into more of an intra-squad
competition as W&L posted sweeping
victories across the board.

“This meet was a chance for us to
push ourselves when we didn’t neces-
sarily have the competition from other
teams,” said senior Brandon Bamds.
“We had to make ourselves rise to the
occasion and try to go fast even when
we didn’t have anyone to compete

against beside ourselves...The fact that
we can still work hard and post some
good times is good to see.”

The Generals were lead by seniors
Ian Childers and Nick Talluri. Talluri
dominated the freestyle events, taking
home ﬁrst place in both the 50 freestyle
(22.12) and the 100 freestyle (48.87).
Childers ﬁnished ﬁrst in the 100 breast
(1104.20) and the 200 breast (2:l9.26)
and also played a key role in the team’s
victoryin the 200 medley relay.

Other relay team members includ-
ed senior Josh Gonzalez, Bamds and
sophomore Chris Washnock. The team
touched in ﬁrst with a time of 1:41.24.

The relay win “was really pretty cool
because our coach split up the relays so
we’d all be fairly even and all have. a
chance to win,” said Bamds, who swam
the ﬁnal freestyle leg in the relay. “The
last leg, all of the freestylers...were all
about even so I was just a tiny bit ahead,
by like a tenth of a second.”

Washnock also earned top honors in
two individual events. He placed ﬁrst in
the 100 back (56.05) and the 200 back
(2:01.10). Gonzalez also posted a time

of 2:00.71 in the 200 fly, good enough
to earn him an individual medal of his
own.

W&L also led the way in the 400
freestyle relay with a ﬁrst-place ﬁnish
of 3:26.96. Senior Jonathan Giesen an-
chored the relay, backed by sophomore
Jeff Stirling, senior Kevin Com and
sophomore Ryan Hartman.

Giesen also placed ﬁrst in the 100 fly
with a time of 55.42.

On the women’s side, the team’s
ﬁrst-years stepped up big, racking in
four titles between them to bring their
team a victory.

“I feel like, since we have a really
young team, it took us a while to get
freshmen adjusted,” Salvati said. “But
as the'season has progressed they’ve
started to become a bigger part of our
team.” ‘

First-year .Ann McCampbell led
the Generals in long distance swim-
ming with a victory in the 1650 free at
18:55.71.

McCampbell has dominated distance
events for the Generals this year, ﬁll-
ing a void in what used to be one ofthe

women’s weaker events, Salvati said.
“It’s nice to be able to step up and

help the team where maybe we were

lacking before,” McCampbell said.

F irst-year Brittany Ross held the 200 '

ﬂy with a time of 2:18.18, and fellow
ﬁrst-year Delaney Rolfe notched a win
in the 500 free with a time of 5:30.71.

Rolfe was also a member of the wom-
en’s winning 200 medley relay team
which ﬁnished with a time of 1:56.97.
Rolfe was helped by teammates senior
Sarah Simpson,junior Tess Hayden, and
senior Lynn Bazzel.

Simpson was in top form for the Gen-
erals that day, turning in two individual
victories to go with the relay win. She
placed ﬁrst in the 100 freestyle with a
time of 56.42 and the 200 freestyle with
a time of2:03.l3. _

The teams will be back in the pool
next Saturday for a home meet against
Johns Hopkins. The meet kicks off at 11
a.m.

When a field goal isn’t just threepoints

Kickers had a dismal showing in the ﬁrst two rounds of the NFL playoﬂs and handed their teams disappointing losses

By Adam Cancryn
STAFF WRITER

With four minutes left in the divi-
sional round game between the Jets and
Chargers, CBS cut to a close-up shot of
San Diego kicker Nate Kaeding.

Alone on the sideline, his expression
one of shock and confusion, he looked
as if he’d rather be anywhere than on
that ﬁeld.

Given the chance, Chargers fans
likely would’ve granted him his wish.

Kaeding had just ﬁnished shank-
ing his third ﬁeld goal of the game,
a 40-yarder pushed just right of the
posts. Though San Diego notched a
touchdown on its next drive, it was not
enough. They would lose by three, and
Kaeding, the Pro Bowler who hit 91.4
percent of his regular season kicksgand

zero percent when it mattered, was the

scapegoat.

While he might have felt alone on
the sideline, Kaeding is just one of a
procession of kickers whose postseason
incompetence has doomed their respec-
tive teams.

Through the ﬁrst two rounds of the
NFL playoffs, placekickers on losing
teams made just three of their 13 ﬁeld
goal attempts. That comes out to a con-
version rate of just 23 percent.

Compare that to a regular season that

saw kickers banging home threes at an
81 percent clip and something certainly
seems amiss. Even the Tampa Bay Buc-
caneers, saddled with the worst kicking
game in the league, managed to sneak
one through the uprights three times out
of ﬁve.

So why, during the most crucial time
of the year, won’t the ball just go to its
home?

It’s certainly not due to a lack of tal-
ent. Kickers on losing teams_combined
to hit 84 percent of their regular season
attempts. The Cardinals’ Neil Rackers.
led the league, converting 16 of his 17
kicks before bungling a potential game-
winner in the Wild Card round and miss-
ing another seven days later. Kaeding
missed just three all year before equal-
ing that number in one playoff game.

But the postseason takes place in the
dead of winter, where a simple shift in
wind direction can completely change a
game. Maybe the elements are to blame
for such ineptitude.

Unless these players were thrown off
by the immaculate conditions, not likely.
In the ﬁrst two rounds, three games were
played in domes and one was played in
San Diego. Not many blizzards to worry
about there.

No, as more numbers are crunched
and situations examined, there seems to
be no logical explanation for the sudden
onset of yips, yanks, shanks and ﬁubs
that have turned the game’s best kick-
ers into that guy from Section 247 they
bring down at halftime for a $1,000 try.

Attempts aren’t from any farther
away than normal. The average ﬁeld

Even more distressing is the role
this unusual trend has had in determin-
ing outcomes. The Cincinnati Bengals’
Shayne Graham missed twice against
New York, including a 28-yarder that
would have brought them within one
point with 3:49 left. Instead, the Jets
took over and ran out the clock.

Down 19 early in the fourth quar-

It is no coincidence that the four re-
maining teams going into championship
weekend were. perfect when trying for
three. The Jets, beneﬁciaries of a mi-
raculous chain of events that enabled
them to slip into the playoffs, continue
to thrive off of others’ mistakes. Oppos-
ing kickers are 0-5 against them through
two rounds.

Had Keading converted just one of his three chances, San Diego could have

potentially forced overtime and gone on to win. Instead, the offense sat helplessly

as its opponent ran out the clock.

_ 

goal length for losing teams’ kickers is
44 yards. It’s no chip shot, but regular
season attempts from that distance were
successful three-quarters of the time.

Playoff pressure? Past history sug-
gests it has little effect, especially for a
group with 904 successful kicks under
their belt. In 2008, there were only six
misses in the entire playoffs. This year is
on pace to set the record for lowest ﬁeld
goal percentage since the NFL switched
to a 12-team playoff fonnat in 1990.

ter and trying to help his team claw its
way back, the New England Patriots’
Stephen Gostkowski pulled his attempt
wide right. They wouldn’t regain pos-
session until the two-minute warning,
leaving them far too little time to rally.
And had Kaeding converted just one
of his three chances, San Diego could
have potentially forced overtime and
gone on to win. Instead, the offense sat
helplessly as its opponent ran out the

clock. W

The staggering lack of efﬁciency
thus far is surely a small sample size, but
it carries with it serious implications. In
the Super Bowl, one team wins and one
loses. There is no next game, no second
chance. Just a ﬁnal score, one that is
often determined by the gangly, highly
specialized kicking machine standing

alone on the sideline, waiting for his“

shot.

Sophomore forward Becca Bolton,
who garnered ODAC Player of the Week
honors for her efforts last week, scored l9
points to go with her l2 rebounds.

Junior guard Allie Long netted 15
points and added six boards while junior
center Felice Herman stuffed the stat sheet
with 10 points, nine rebounds and four as-
sists.

Herman said she was pleased with the
team’s effort.

“We were not expecting them to be as
tough as they were,” she said. “They took
us out of our game plan in the ﬁrst half
defensively but I thought we rallied well
in the second. ‘We cannot make the same
mistakes.”

Although the Generals gained a win,
for a team with so much talent, there is
always room for improvement.

“All we can do is continue to work
hard in practice and improve every day,
every game,” Herman said.

On Saturday night, the team traveled to
Emory and Henry to face yet another con-
ference opponent. W&L’s stiﬁing defense
came out in full force this contest. Coach
Mandy King’s squad held the Wasps to a
mere 31 ﬁeld goal percentage, and pres-
sured the opponent into coughing up 21
turnovers. Seeing such strong defensive
numbers is usually a good thing, and that
proved true as the Generals dispatched the
Wasps by a score of 55-45.

The Generals trailed 19-16 with six
minutes left in the ﬁrst half, but did not
look back from there as they seized the
lead for good.

Bolton continued her torrid pace with
19 points and 12 rebounds, completing
her eighth double-double of the season.
Herman again complemented her with a
clutch l4-point, ll-board effort.

Bolton has arguably been the catalyst
ofthe team’s dominating play of late. She
is averaging 15 points and 11 rebounds
a game, good enough for ﬁfth-in-league
scoring and second-in-league rebounding.
Her eight double-doubles have often oc-
curred when it matters most, during key
conference matches.

Expectations continue to climb within
the program, Herman said.

“Our goals have remained the same:
win ODACS,” she said. “Now, it seems as

though we are deﬁnitely on our way. We _

had a very tough non-conference schedule
which gave us the conﬁdence we need in
ODAC play because no team can throw
something at us that we have not already
seen.”

The Generals’ next game is versus
Guilford College, next Friday at home.

The facts
about drugs

Even light use can affect the

brain, says expert

By Eric Gehman
STAFF WRITER

Dr. Scott Swartzwelder, Professor of Psychology
at Duke University, visited Washington and Lee last
week to share the ﬁndings of his extensive research
on recreational drug abuse in Stackhouse Theater
last Thursday night.

His presentation, sponsored by LIFE, the IFC,
the Panhellenic Council and the Ofﬁce of Health
Promotion, focused on the long-term effects of alco-
hol on both the adolescent and adult brain. He then
opened the ﬂoor to abroader discussion about differ-
ent drugs like ecstasy, cocaine and marijuana.

Dr. Swartzwelder discussed at length his research
about how the adolescent brain, which can continue
developing through the age of 24, is far more sensi-
tive to the acute effects of alcohol abuse—especially
those essential to learning and memory.

According to his presentation, adolescence is a
period where the brain is “built to learn,” but even
light alcohol consumption can slow and dull the
hippocampus and the cerebellum, two regions of
the brain that are most important to the encoding of
information into long-term memory. These effects
can also become “locked-in,” and hinder the brain’s
ability to learn and form new memories well into
adulthood.

In an experiment which measured and compared
subjects’ ability to memorize and later reproduce a
complex geometric drawing, even a group of 21 to

24 year-olds was more affected by alcohol consump- .

tion than another experimental group aged just 25

“I would think that science would
be a compelling motivator for
W&L students to examine how
they use alcohol. ”

Jan Kaufman, director of health promotion

to 29. Another experiment documented the behav-
ior of subjects who were blackout drunk, during the
period in which they could not form new long-term
memories, 33 percent of subjectsiseriously insulted
someone, 16.3 percent were involved in an argument
or ﬁght, 24.8 percent engaged in sexual activity, 6.2
percent had unprotected sex and 2.5 percent even got
behind the wheel of a car. 5.1 percent of subjects
engaged in unwanted sexual activity.

The question-and-answer session after Swartz-
welder’s formal presentation opened the discussion
to other drugs that are abused heavily within the col-
lege environment. '

Marijuana was a popular topic of inquiry: many
students asked about its long-term effects on mood
and brain function. Contrary to popular belief,

Swartzwelder noted, there is no conclusive body of l

evidence to prove that moderate usage of pot can af-
fect cognition. ,

He also advocated that marijuana is less harmful
to the brain than alcohol—but he was quick to in-
clude that he believes no one should consume alco-
hol or cannabis before the age of 25. That is when the
brain stops signiﬁcant development processes and is
better equipped to handle the potentially harmful ef-
fects these drugs can cause.

Regarding cocaine, he talked about the addictive
drugs power to take over lives. “You make choices
you otherwise wouldn’t make because of the drug,”
he said in a tone of absolute gravity. He also noted
its “pharmacological speciﬁcity,” or its ability to af-
fect dopamine levels in the brain, which makes it so
highly addictive.

Jan Kaufman, director of health promotion, ex-
pressed her concern about binge drinking at W&L
but also her optimism , that students can change
drinking culture for the better.

“I would think that science would be a compel-
ling motivator for W&L students to examine how
they use alcohol,” said Kaufman, who noted that she
found it hard to imagine that “W&L students would
intentionally decrease their competitive advantage
in the classroom and in the future.”

After searching two houses
and conﬁscating drugs and
paraphernalia, police arrest
one former student and

investigate others

By Valaree Tang
STAFF WRITER

Lexington and Rockbridge Coun-
ty police have searched two student
residences and arrested one former
Washington and Lee student after an
18-month investigation involving the
illegal possession of narcotics.

Police implemented two search
warrants on Saturday, Jan 23. The
ﬁrst search was executed at an off-
campus student residence on Jef-
ferson Street. Later that night, law
enforcement oﬂicials searched an-
other off-campus residence located

‘on Winding Way, a house Inore com-

monly known to W&L students as
Down Wind. Items were seized from
both locations. .

Peter Joseph Martinez, 22, who
is no longer enrolled as a student at
W&L. was arrested on the felony
charge of possession of a controlled
substance with the intent to distrib-
ute. Students say that Maitinez was
attending classes earlier this term.

Police used an informant to make
multiple purchases from the Jefferson
Street apartment. Within 72 hours of
an informant’s purchase of a con-
trolled substance, police executed a

search warrant from said apartment.

In November, police had bought
.819 grams ofcocaine from Martinez.
The police department has video and
audio evidence ofthe drug sales.

Police recovered evidence that
supported MaItinez’s narcotic crimes
within the residence. Upon his arrest,
Martinez admitted to distributing co-
caine from his residence.

Martinez was released from Rock-
bridge Regional Facility on $5,000
unsecured bond early last Sunday

  

morning. His court appearance is
scheduled for April 27.

If convicted, Martinez may face
between ﬁve and 40 years impris-
onment, and ﬁned not more than
$500,000, according to the Code of
Virginia.

According to court records, police
conﬁscated 19 baggies of white pow-
der, a ﬁlm canister ﬁlled with green

in‘.

and observed cocaine at the Winding
Way premises, according to court re-
cords.

The address at Winding Way is
known to house members of Kappa
Alpha Order. Upon search of the

house, law enforcement ofﬁcials
seized a pill bottle with green plant
material. three bags and 74 smaller
bags of white powder substance.

plant material and drug parapherna-
lia, including a scale and marijuana
grinders.

Police seized 22.6 grams of the
white powder, and 3.6 grams of the
green plant. The substances were de-
termined by lab tests to be cocaine
and marijuana.

Because Martinez is no longer a
student at W&L, he is not under the
jurisdiction of the University or the
honor system.

Martinez provided information
during his interview with the Rock-
bridge County Sheriff’s Oﬂ”Ice Drug
Task Force that led to the second
search last Saturday, with the as-

. sistance of the Lexington police de-

partment. He said that he purchased

Police also conﬁscated a Grand
Cherokee Jeep, as well as $837 in
cash. Court records say that police
seized evidence of distribution.

Rockbridge County Sheriff Bob
Day said that the sheriff’s depart-
ment believes the substances conﬁs-
cated by police at Winding Way are
drugs. No arrests were made on site,
but an investigation continues.

The identities of the students in-

volved in the criminal activity at
Down Wind are not yet known.

Dean Dawn Watkins, vice presi-
dent for student affairs and dean of
students, said that the student hand-
book contains a clear no-tolerance
policy on the university’s criminal
and felonious activity.

 

The handbook appropriates sus-
pension to students who use or pos-
sess illegal drugs or controlled sub-
stances.

“lt’s important that we, as a uni-
versity, not pre-judge anything in an
ongoing matter. When appropriate,
the university applies its policies and
procedures,” said Dean Watkins.

Rumors that members of Kappa
Alpha are undergoing drug tests are
unconﬁrmed. lnterfratemity Council
president Garrott McClintock said
that he was unaware of the drug tests.
According to McClintock, no charges
have been brought forward and there
is no current investigation from the
IFC for Kappa Alpha. He said that all
he has heard are rumors.

Kappa Alpha Order, which was
founded in Lexington in 1865, is
one-third of the Lexington Triad. lts
national ofﬁce is located in Lexing-
ton. ’

The executive director of Kappa
Alpha, Larry Stanton Wiese, said that
he has only heard rumors as well.

“We don’t believe our chapter has
been involved with any illegal activ-
ity,” said Wiese, who also said that
the chapter is waiting for “some law
enforcement to occur.”

Wiese said that the chapter has
strict bylaws that prohibit illegal ac-
tivity, and that all members are ex-
pected to adhere to the policies.

Fraternity house ﬂoods

Student allegedly breaks pipe and ﬂoods Chi Psi basement, forcing party to evacuate

NEWS EDITOR

When students attended Chi Psi’s
“Late Nite” this Saturday#the fra-
ternity’s signature dance party that
usually begins at midnight—dancers
got drenched by more than sweat and
been

Surprised partygoers found them-
selves rushed out of the basement
and the fraternity house as about
600 gallons of water ﬂooded the ﬁrst
ﬂoor and the basement.

At about I a.m, a student who is
not a member of Chi Psi, reportedly
ripped a ﬁre sprinkler out of the ceil-
ing on the third ﬂoor, causing the
connecting pipe to break. Gallons

upon gallons of murky water cas-
caded down one of the stairwells and

into the lower ﬂoors.

As the water began to ﬁll up the
basement, the members of Chi Psi
began to hurry everyone out to avoid
injury and possible deaths. Due to
the large amount of equipment used
by the Late Nite disc jockey, DJ
Duane, members expressed concern
for the dancers and acted quickly in
rushing everyone out of the fraterni-
ty house and shutting down the party.
Ultimately, because of the Chi Psi
brothers‘ quick reactions and good
judgment, no one was hurt.

With the amount of water that
ﬂooded the house, some of DJ
Duane’s equipment suffered some
damage and will have to be replaced.
According to one of the brothers of
Chi Psi, DJ Duane could go through_
insurance or could even sue to make

S up the damage done to his equip-

ment.

Chi Psi, due to restrictions placed
on them by their Nationals, could
not comment on the situat'ion nor as
to what action will be taken against
the person who caused the ﬂooding
and water damage. However, inspec-
tors will be looking over the Chi Psi

house to determine the extent of the
damage. ’

But what about Chi Psi’s famed
dance party? The members have said
that, later on this term, Late Nite will
make a comeback, but for now, they
are focusing on putting the ends to-
gether and ﬁxing their house.

Habitat donates for homes in Haiti

W&L chapter of Habitat for Humanity receives money to provide transitional housing to homeless

By Paige Gance
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee
chapter of Habitat for Humanity
has received $2,076.90 to ﬁnance
transitional shelters for the disas-
ter-stricken people of Haiti.

Representatives from the
chapter appeared before the EC
to apply for the ﬁmds near the
beginning of the winter term. In
granting these funds, the EC took
into account the past successes
and future plans of W&L’s Habi-
tat chapter.

This donation, made in con-
junction with a $4,000 donation
from the Rockbridge County
Habitat, will pay for what Charles
Wilson, co-chair of W&L’s Hab-
itat Chapter, calls “a foundation
upon which you can build a nor-
mal home.”

These one-room houses cost
about $2,500 to construct, with
additional rooms costing around
$300 to $500. Instead of con-
crete, which is the preferred
building material in heavily
deforested Haiti, the roofs are

made of galvanized aluminum.
Whereas concrete roofs col-
lapsed easily under the strain of
an earthquake that ranked 7.0 on
the Richter scale, these roofs are
quake-resistant, a reassuring fact
given the aftershocks that contin-
ue to torment an already stricken
nation.

Experts estimate that the
number of displaced Haitians is
between 1 million and 1.5 mil-
lion, with over 200,000 homes
destroyed. This devastation has
forced residents to set up make-
shift shelters from earthquake
rubble. Often, their only protec-
tion from the elements is a thin
bed sheet set up on four sticks.

Those lucky enough to live
in tents still lack the water tanks
and latrines provided by the
Habitat shelters. As problems of
sanitation and illness threaten the
health of survivors, this equip-
ment could save lives.

W&L’s Habitat has a history
of helping those in need, both 10-
cally and abroad. This year alone
has seen $9,500 in funds raised

for Habitat homes in Rockbridge
County.

T-shirt sales and concession
stands have supplemented this
amount, but the bulk, according
to Wilson, comes from Habitat
Hotel. As W&L parents can at-
test, ﬁnding accommodations

goes toward building homes in
Rockbridge County.

Wilson said he hopes to ex-
pand Habitat Hotel to include the
days around graduation, as part of

Weekend can be a nightmare.
Habitat Hotel creatively solves
this problem while raising mon-
ey for the organization by ask-
ing faculty members to rent out

the chapter has raised enough
funds this past year to qualify for
a State Farms matching grant of
$5,000, a goal it hopes to achieve
annually.

It is these past accomplish-
ments and promises of future
success that led the EC to allo-

cate funds for Habitat. Usually,
the major assignment of funds
occurs in the spring, and only
clubs and organizations that have
run out of cash reapply for funds
in the winter.

However, the earthquake in
Haiti created special and un-
expected circumstances, and
chapter leaders said they felt this
humanitarian crisis called for
addition funds on top of those
already committed to the Rock-
bridge homes.

According to a press release,
“The shelters are the ﬁrst step to
getting the people of Haiti back
into viable housing and recon-
structing the nation’s capital.”

The poorly designed build-
ings and shoddy construction
materials contributed heavily
to the high rate of building col-
lapse, according to a recent New
York Times article.

The components of the most‘

common material, concrete, are
expensive to import, causing
manufacturers to add dangerous
amounts of sand to the mix. Add

to this the lack of strict building
codes and the construction of
homes on unstable hillsides, and
the stage is set for mass devasta-
tion.

The Habitat shelters will not
only provide immediate relief
to Haiti’s survivors but also the
beginnings ofa permanent infra-
structure stronger than the previ-
ous.

Eating well, eating local in d-hall

W&L is dining services are increasing their efforts to incorporate foods produced in county and lﬁrginia

By Chelsea Stevenson
8 TA F F W R IT E R

Have you ever eaten in the
Marketplace, the law school, one
of the ﬁve sorority houses, or
at a catered event at W&L? Of
course. But during your experi-
ence did you really think about
what you were putting in your
mouth? Probably not.

What you most likely did not
realize is that in eating through
W&L’s dining services, you’re.
doing more than just consuming
tasty meals, you’re helping mul-
tiple parts of the community.

Over the past three years,
W&L has increased its local food
use to nearly 18 percent. The
dining services staff now looks
in the surrounding areas ﬁrst, to
ﬁnd foods such as honey, milk,
chicken, apples, berries and pea-
nut butter.

The search begins in Rock-
bridge County. W&L’s beef,
for example, comes from Char-

lie Potter’s Buffalo Creek Beef
company. Next, the search for
foods expands to the food shedof
the Shenandoah Valley.

Chris Carpenter, the special
projects coordinator in the cater-
ing department, explained that
the Shenandoah Valley is one
of the major food valleys in the
US. Our pork loin comes from
the Shenandoah.

Local foods also extend state-
wide. For example, apples come
from Nelson County, just 60
miles away from W&L, and pea-
nut butter comes from the Appo-
mattox region on the soutli side
of Virginia. Local foods here at
W&L also extend throughout the
south region of the U.S.

Carpenter’s role in search-
ing for local foods is to visit
each farm, looking for farmers
who can produce their goods at
the quantity and volume W&L
needs. He said has no complaints
about his the local food search.

“It’s like getting paid to hang
out with a farmer,” Carpenter
said.

The one problem that Carpen-
ter said he often runs into during
his search for local foods is that
farmers oﬁen do not have the ca-
pability to produce the volume
W&L needs. For one month’s ,
worth of meals in the Market-
place alone, W&L needs 150
chickens. However, according to
Marketplace chef Geraldine Mc-
Cutcheon, giving local farmers
these high quantitiy orders helps
their market and ensires that they
continuously have a client.

' McCutcheon also commented
on the beneﬁts eating locally has
on the community. She that be-
cause W&L is a small university
in a small town, working person-
ally with farmers helps improve
the community ties. The fact that
W&L has formed several close
relationships with Virginia farms
has encouraged other universi-

ties to do the same.

At the Homestead Creamery
in Burnt Chimney, Va., just out-
side of Roanoke, several other
universities have joined W&L
in creating a conjunction for the
creamery’s milk, a favorite of
Chef McCutcheon and Assis-
tant Director of Cafe ‘77 Dennis
Fowler. Because of this, Home-
stead Creamery has improved its
equipment by purchasing a small
processor to meet the local high
demand. One of these universi-
ties is Virginia Tech.

Eating locally helps the farm-
ers, but it also improves the sus-
tainability and energy efﬁciency
in the community, said Carpen-
ter.

He explained the reduction
in energy usage by comparing
the transportation of Washington
apples to W&L to the transporta-
tion of Virginia apples. Washing-
ton apples, which come in 40-48
a case, take 3,500 carbon miles

and several days to transport.

Apples from a Virginia or-
chard, although only 17 a case,
takes 60 carbon miles and are
overall fresher. Therefore, eat-
ing locally undoubtedly results
in a signiﬁcantly lower carbon
footprint.

Dwight Bitz, assistant direc-
tor of the Brief Stop at the law
school, explained that using local
foods also causes less packaging
waste and implements recycling.
The Homestead Creamery and
Buffalo Creek Beef, among sev-
eral other companies, reuse tubs
and glass bottles through a de-
pository system.

The ﬁnal beneﬁt to eating
locally affects ‘the entire W&L
community. Eating local foods is
simply healthier. The local meats
contain no hormones or antibiot-
ics and in theory are organic, just
without the certiﬁcation.

Carpenter explained that our
bodies are able to break down

the local foods faster because
they do not contain high fructose
corn syrup.

“Better taste simply means
better nutrition,” Carpenter said.

New options for pre-law students

Consultant expands pre-law program, including advice on the Web and a spring term job opportunity

By Llzz Dye
STAFF WRITER

Pre-Law Studies has always
been a great resource for Wash-
ington and Lee students inter-
ested in law school. Abigail
Perdue, Special Consultant to
the Pre-Law Program, hopes to
expand Pre-Law Studies and rec-
ommended that faculty and stu-
dents attend a Mock Law School
Admission Committee Meeting
on J an. 28.

This meeting V provided

“unique insight into the law
school decision-making process,”
according to a press release from
Perdue. Representatives from
George Washington University
"Law School, the University of
Richmondkschool of Law, and
the Charleston School of Law
provided students with unique
insight into how law schools
make their admission decisions.
Its goal was to help students re-
ally see how the law schools are
going to see them and make their
decisions.

Some common questions that
students ask when applying to
law school include whether to
list Greek life as an extracurricu-
lar activity on a resume. Perdue,

, who is a W&L alum herself, said

she hopes to help studies more
easily answer these questions by
enhancing the pre-law resources
available to students.

One way of doing this is pre-

law advising. There are already
two existing pre-law advisors,
Dr. Robert Culpepper and Pro-
fessor Lucas Morel, both located
in the C-school. V
Perdue has also created a pre-
law Web site which launched
in December. She is constantly
maintaining and updating it. It
includes internship information,
tips on how to decide whether to
go to law school and law courses
currently offered, among many
other resources. To ﬁnd the web-
site, go to the W&L Web site and
search “Pre-Law Studies.”
There is a also a new student-
run group called “Generals Inter-
ested in Legal Studies” (GILS).
Senior Alex Caritis is the presi-
dent of the newly elected board.
These students are responsible
for planning social and speaking
events related to law school.
Caritis said the main goal is
to “show the administration that
people do have interest in pre-
law” and to “increase exposure to
both law school and the various
facets of the legal profession.”
A new pre-law mentoring pro-
gram has also been established:
Law School Liaisons. It matches
up undergraduates interested in
law with W&L law students, like
the Big Brother/Sister program.
Perdue says that it is an “informal
way to breach the gap between
law school and undergrads.”
Workshops and sessions are

held to give students insight into
law school. Earlier this year, for
example, a W&L alum who is at
Yale Law School and works at
admissions there was brought in
to speak. An LSAT prep work-

shop is provided to give advice‘

about preparations. A Kaplan
teacher was also brought in to
give tips on the LSAT.

Another speaker who was
brought in was Professor Kim
Forde-Marzui. He is the Direc-
tor of the Center for the Study of
Race and Law for UVA. He gave
a talk on same-sex marriage ear-
lier this year and how it pertains
the legal battles going on cur-
rently.

Perdue has worked out a
Spring Option for Pre-Law
where a student, preferably a se-
nior, will be able to work at Blue
Ridge Legal Services under the
supervision of an attorney. This
provides a great legal intem-
ship for those interested in law
school.

She also hasinforrnation on
law school by major and how
different majors should go about
applying for law school. She is
currently updating the pre-law
bulletin board in the C—School to
increase awareness of the avail-
ability of pre-law resources.

She said that she is impressed
with the student body and excit-
ed_about the future of the pre-law
resources at the school.

Perdue is also offering cours-
es pertaining to pre-law. Last
semester, she taught the course
INTR 180, which dealt with di-
versity and discrimination and

appointment in higher education. '

Students in the class read cases,
did legal research and participat-
ed in a mock trial. A law school
professor served as the judge, and
the jury consisted of students not
in the class as well as the dean of
the college.

In the spring she is teach-
ing INTR 220, “American Law:
Great Cases and Controversies,”
which will focus on controversial
issues in American law. Students
will be using legal resources, do-
ing legal drafting and reading ac-
tual cases. The goal will be how
to learn to think and write like a
lawyer.

Six seniors to teach

for America

Students will spend two years after graduation teaching in low-income school systems for T FA

By Katy Stewart
STAFF WRITER

Some seniors worry about
ﬁnding a job after graduation, but
six Washington and Lee seniors
plan to embark on a challenging,

_ eye-opening, two-year teaching

experience: Teach for America.
Becca Beeson, Beth Brantley,
Alex Caritis, Kim Holland, Josh
Gonzalez and Zach Segall will
represent W&L around the coun-
try in low income school systems,
working to “eliminate education-
al inequality,” TFA’s cornerstone
goal. W&L has produced a di-
verse mix of TFA participants,

but they all share a common trait:

their W&L experience led them
to TFA and prepared them to un-
dertake this responsibility.

The program recruits students
from all academic backgrounds,
but everyone must exhibit strong
leadership skills. Beeson found
leadership opportunities dur-
ing her W&L years working for
Head Start at the local Waddell
Elementary School. Next year
she will teach elementary stu-
dents in Dallas. "

Segall also demonstrated

strong leadership skills through
fraternity and Outing Club in-

pi

 

volvement, and will be working
with special needs children in
Phoenix.

TFA does not mandate any
teaching experience, but Holland
said she found that her Founda-
tions of Education course piqued
her interest in teaching. The class
discussed the education system’s
inequality and achievement gap,
which is linked to socioeconomic
status.

Gonzalez, who will work in
the San Francisco area, consid-
ers Teach for America “a logical
next step,” combining his interest
in teaching with his background
in athletic leadership.

TFA identiﬁed these students’
strengths and potential impact,
selecting them from an impres-
sive pool of applicants. Beeson
recalls a 2009 Wall Street Jour-
nal figure, that “ll percent of Ivy
League seniors apply,” so W&L’s
statistic of six students is praise-
worthy, especially considering
the rigorous application proce-
dure.

The process begins with a
phone interview. In the second
round, TFA invites students to



  P     
p    

what Beeson calls a “grueling
day—long interview process,” in-
volving group discussions, timed
essays, logic puzzles and teach-
ing simulations. Students are
asked to present a ﬁve-minute
lesson plan, write a mock letter
to parents and hold a one-on-one
interview. ‘ Beeson, who will be
teaching English as a second lan-

versity. The two years teaching
in low-income schools makes all
six students “very nervous,” as
Gonzalez put it, because of the
“big task to help.”

“lt’s a big responsibility,” he
said.

Yet the W&L experience pro-
vided adequate tools for the chal-
lenges of teaching urban youth,

“[My] whole W&L experience culminates

with TFA. ”

 j—::

guage, also took a Spanish test.
F or,these students, the under-
taking is not just another resume
builder. Holland explained that
the TFA program is an opportu-
nity to “help as many people as
possible and make an impact.”
Segall likewise chose TFA “in
pursuit of achieving results.” The
motivation behind the program
comes from the desire to close
the achievement gap, despite ad-

according to Holland. She attri-
butes her leadership experience
to the Pan-Asian Association for
Cultural Exchange (PAACE) and
said she thinks this group fostered
her “perspective of different cul-
tures,” both of Asian cultures
and multiculturalism in general.
She has confidence in her orga-
nization and cooridination skills,
much afforded by managing her
busy W&L schedule.

ayiuun

In addition to classroom
management skills, Beeson and
Gonzalez cited extracurricular
opportunities as advantages to-
ward achieving teaching success.
Beeson said that her “whole
W&L experience culminates
with TFA.” She studied with
the Shepherd Poverty Program,
served as English for Speakers
of Other Languages co-chair and
worked for Senator Ted Kennedy
during Washington Term. Her-
work with ESOL and education
policy motivated her application
to TFA.

Swimming instilled values
of determination and persever-
ance, said Gonzalez, critical
traits teachers need. He thinks
the W&L environment allows
students “the opportunity to do
whatever you want and find what
you’re good at.”

Beyond the two-year teach-
ing commitment, the students
are looking to the future. They
named ideas such as law school,
graduate school in teaching and
public policy, the army and con-
tinuing teaching. One thing is
sure: the next two years hold a

steep learning curve. lnner-city
schools separate the dedicated
teacher from the half-hearted.

Heart counts the most in win-
ning a spot at TFA. When asked
to advise W&L students inter-
ested in TFA, all emphasized
the need for passion: this job is
not for someone who just needs
a post—graduation gig. Holland
recommended that students thor-
oughly prepare for the tough in-
terview process. Beeson recalled
that her creativity in the mock-
lesson plan set her apart, and
Gonzalez suggested researching
the organization as much as pos-
sible before applying and inter-
viewing.

Liberals are tired and pissed off about 2009, but look

Liberals knew that a single-

High-speed rail production not practical  

Obama is plan to revitalize American high-speed rail does not live up to rhetoric

By Jarrett Brotzman
C 0 L U M N l ST

On Wednesday evening,
President Obama addressed the
nation in the annual tradition of
the State of the Union address.

The speech wasﬁlled with
all we would have expected to
hear: not-so-subtle jabs at House
Republicans for blocking liberal
legislative items, compliments
of Michelle’s work, talk of
hope and change and, of course,
vague spending agenda items
with little mention of how these

vast spending increases would

be covered.

But between the all the “let
me clear,” “make no mistake,”
and “change won’t be easy”
Obamaisms that we have all
come to know and love, there
was one item in particular that
stuck out to me as an intriguing
item on his aggressive agenda
plan for Year 2: high-speed rail.

This projected $8 billion pro-
gram to bring high-speed rail
to many areas across America
strikes me as one of the more ef-
fective ways to spend stimulus
money. ‘

According to White House
spokesmen Bill Burton, this
investment is the largest infra-
structure investments in Ameri-
ca since the construction of the
Interstate Highway System in
1956.

The ‘long-term beneﬁts seem
pretty substantial: they are pro-
jected to include lowering reli-
ance on foreign oil, increasing
commerce between cities linked
by high-speed rail, lowering
transportation by airplane within
inter—country travel and reduc-
ing overall emissions across the
country as more commuters sub-
stitute train travel for short- and
medium-distance commutes.

These beneﬁts paint a very
rosy picture of future American
travel, where the difference in
technology between domestic
rail lines and efficient European
rail have been compared to the
gap between “the planes ﬂown
by World War I ﬂying aces and
today’s jets,” says Anthony Perl,
chairman of the National Re-
search Council’s intercity rail
panel

The $8 billion investment

Massachusetts was a mes-
sage from liberal Democrats to
Obama and . Democratic mem-
bers of Congress: Quit playing
Mr. Nice Guy, grow a pair, ﬂy
the middle ﬁnger in the faces of
obstructionist Republicans and
get something done.

Obama’s attempts at bipar-
tisanship have been admirable.
However, now that we have es-
tablished that the Republicans
will oppose everything Demo-
crats say and do, I thinklthat it
is safe to say that the time for
bipartisanship is over.

Let me throw out a few facts.
Fact: Expecting Republicans
to help get healthcare reform
passed is ridiculous.

Fact: Olympia Snowe does
not give a damn about anyone
other than Olympia Snowe.

Fact: Voters will blame you
for not having solved a problem
you didn’t create. Get over it.

as part of the National Recov-
ery Act is intended to narrow
the gap. However, the reality of
Obama’s recently announced in-
vestments is a more complicated
picture than the Federal Rail-
road Administration would like
to portray.

Fact: Obstruction makes great
politics and bad policy.

Once these facts are estab-
lished, maybe Obama and Con-
gressional Democrats can begin
to see that moving to the right to
appease the LiberDems and Re-
publicans is not working.

Every time Obama has moved
to the right, the middle class has
gotten screwed over: the stimu-
lus bill, the Wall Street bail-
out (bonuses? Really?) and the
healthcare debacle. This is the
source of the brewing populist
outrage.

I think that Obama is begin-
ning to see the light. In his State
of the Union address, it sounded
like Obama is starting to under-
stand where the populist outrage
lies and is changing his tone.

Obama was elected on a plat-
form of change, and now the time
for change has come. Change
is never easy—especially if it

can company currently has the
technology or manufacturing ca-
pacity to develop or build these
trains. Transportation Secretary
Ray LaHood and members of
Congress have acknowledged
this lack of industrial capacity.

I don’t see this as an issue;

The bottom line—Obama is vision of this

stimulus creating high-paying, permanent

American jobs is at best overly optimistic

and at worst a pipe dream.

One overlooked difficulty is
the current state of “high-speed
rail” in the U.S. In America,
high-speed rail is more misno-
mer than reality.

There currently exists one—
that’s right, one—high-speed
line in the United States. It is
Amtrak’s Acela line that oper-
ates between Boston and Wash-
ington, D.C., which does reach
a maximum speed of 150 mph,
but really averages just 67 mph
between Boston and New York,
and 77 mph between New York
and Washington.

The vast majority of other in-
tercity rail in the United States
averages less than 80 mph (A.P.,
I/28). This is a far cry from Eu-
ropean and Japanese rail speeds,
where lines in France and Japan
average 169 mph and 159 mph,
respectively.

Proposed routes promise to
reach high speeds of around 220
mph in California between Sac-
ramento and San Diego, and 150
mph in Florida between Tampa
and Orlando. Unfortunately, av-
erage speeds in Florida will only
be around 86 mph, a reality far
from the optimistic outlook giv-
en by the Department of Trans-
portation announcement.

Another snag in the adminis-
tration’s plan to use high-speed
rail as a catalyst for high-paying
American job creation is the un-
fortunate reality that no Ameri-

foreign competitive advantage
will result in foreign ﬁrms, such
as Siemens and Central Japan
Railway Co., building this new
infrastructure, using American
workers in lower-paying work
such as construction and lower-
tech development.

Eventually, American ﬁrms
might be able to efﬁciently build
this technology, but any new
“Buy American” provisions
would only result in inferior rail

messes with the status quo and
big money interests.

Let’s see if Obama can deliv-
er on the promises of his State of
the Union address.

technology.

The bottom line—Obama’s
vision of this stimulus creat-
ing high-paying, permanent
American jobs is at best overly
optimistic and at worst a pipe
dream.

The reality of current high-
speed rail plans is far different
from what the Obama adminis-
tration would like to portray.

In the short term, it does have
the potential to make a small
diﬁ°erence in the unemployment
rate and improve current rail
travel, but this plan is no magic
bullet to the 10 percent unem-

Bringing theenergy back to winter-term parties

If your party night pre-games need a little ﬂair, Stop-In can caﬂeinate your night with some new, exciting beverages

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

Having a successful pre-game
is getting harder and harder these
days.

The days are darker, the se-
mester is in full swing and in
case you haven’t noticed, there’s
quite a bit of snow on the ground.
It seems like by the time you ﬁ-
nally. ﬁnish a paper, .it’s already
time to head out to Windfall.

Gone are the lazy autumn
days when you can spend all
your free time gleefully tailgat-
ing football games and slowly
getting wasted at a snail’s pace.

This is the winter, when
vodka shots with ice tea chasers
seem like the most efficient way
to race your way to drunkenness.
Let’s be honest: the only real
reason Russians made vodka in
the ﬁrst place was to make their
harsh winters a little warmer.

But the problem is, shots can
get boring after a while, and
furthermore, isn’t there a much
more efﬁcient way to somehow
mix the beneﬁts of vodka and
Red Bull into one, tasty drink?
Okay, vodka-Red Bulls don’t
count, just work with me here.

Just in case you’re still hav-
ing trouble ﬁguring out exactly
what l’m alluding to, your local
Stop-ln has the answer.

The key to your winter pre-
gaming happiness is situated be-
tween the caffeinated beverages
aisle and the sealed-off cases,
forties, mixers and other won-
derfully alcoholic beverages.

Why

The alcoholic energy drinks
do exactly what you need from
them, when you need them.

They taste surprisingly pal-
atable for a malt beverage, and
they make sure that you wait for
the last Traveller ride home to
end your fun night. Also, they
provide the foundation for hav-
ing a good night at Washington
and Lee parties speciﬁcally.

Once you get deep into the
country, a consistent «supply of
alcohol is always hard to come

by. Luckily, these alcohol-rid- ‘

den energy drinks don’t really
hit you that hard until long after
they have been consumed. That
would be quite dangerous at
most schools, but cures ‘a prob-
lem here in Lexington.

Furthermore, all that danc-
ing and listening to prospective
hook-ups talk about irrational
things like feelings and opin-
ions can take a lot out of you.
You’re going to need that inﬂux
of caffeine, guarine and taurine
right around the time “Tik Tok”
comes on.

So, now that you are inevita-
bly sold on this wonderful new
addition to your life, how do you
decide what to buy?

Well, if you are looking for
a relatively tame night or you
are not quite sure if you are re-
ally sold on the best liquid since
Gucci Mane’s “Lemonade,” then
you should probably divert your
attention towards the smaller

drinks such as Sparks, Tilt, or
Joose.

These drinks are slightly less
intimidating than their competi-
tors and probably taste a little
better to boot. Unfortunately,
due to pressure from the FDA
(the least fun of the federal ad-
ministrations), Anheuser-Busch
and Miller have taken the caf-
feine out of Sparks and Tilt--so

can reach before the intervention
that will no doubt happen in a
couple of months.

Four Loko and Max are pre-
game behemoths that ensure a
mistake-ridden night. Both con-
tain over 22 ounces of liquid that
is more than l0 percent alcohol,
and both have enough sugar to
be over 500 calories.

God himself could not have

The good news about these drinks [...] is

that you are ensured to be bouncing heartily

along to DJ Tiesto all night.

while they provide a little boost,
they don’t have that same kick
that Joose does.

Plus, according to reports
from various sources, Joose deﬁ-
nitely has the advantage when it
comes to both taste and variety of
ﬂavors. So you can either choose
safety with Sparks or joyous-
ness with Joose, and since you
are already dangerous enough to
be pre-gaming with one of these
things, you might as well go all
out and trust Joose’s sublime ef-
fect on your night.

For those of you who aren’t
satiated by the effect these drinks
have on your glutamate recep-
tors, there is another step you

you should change

the channel to “Friday
Night Lights”

With so much junk that airs on television these days,
“Friday Night Lights ” stands out as great entertainment

By Tyler Burchett
COLU M N I sr

“Clear eyes, full hearts, can’t
lose.”

This is the favorite saying
of one of the greatest football
coaches in television history. I
am referring of course to Eric
Taylor, coach of the Dillon Pan-
thers on the hit NBC show “Fri-
day Night Lights.”

lfyou have not yetjumped on
the “Friday Night Lights” band-
wagon then, simply put, you are
missing out on the best show on
television.

the other hand, there are so many
types of teenagers portrayed
among the players that it creates
an incredibly plausible world
ﬁlled with believable characters
who struggle with real-life deci-
sions and intense emotions.
Then there are the adults who
attempt to be mentors to their
children, when half of them are
screw-ups themselves.
Ultimately, the thing that
sets “Friday Night Lights” apart
as a show is the way that it de-

There are countless scenes in the show

that manage to hit home, both emotion-

ally and personally. It is impossible to

watch the show without being changed, at

least to a small degree.

The fourth season of the show
is set to air over the summer on
NBC. The show was inspired
by both the book and the movie
of the same name, depicting the
lives and struggles of high school
football players in Texas.

However with the show now
in its fourth season, it has cov-
ered more ground and spoken on
more controversial issues than
the two-hour movie, or the novel
ever could.

There are several elements
of the show, and many different
story lines that interconnect in
an incredibly heartfelt and real-
istic way.

There is such a variety of
characters and personalities on
the show that virtually anyone
can ﬁnd a character to whom
they can relate. There are the
football players, who make up
the teen element of the show. On

picts the emotions and interac-
tions between people. There
are countless scenes in the show
that manage to hit home, both
emotionally and personally. It
is impossible to watch the show
without being changed, at least
to a small degree.

Football is the glue that con-
nects all of the characters in the
show, but in reality the show is
about dealing with life, and the
pressures and trials involved
with growing up.

The show features a few ac-
tors from the ﬁlm version of
“Friday Night Lights.” The
most prominent of these is Con-
nie Britton, who plays Coach
Taylor’s wife in the show. She
also played Billy Bob Thom-
ton’s wife in the ﬁlm.

But it is the new characters
that make the show so incredi-
ble. The most important of these

is Coach Eric Taylor, played by
Kyle Chandler. He and Connie
Britton make up the heart of the
show. Kyle Chandler plays an
intense football coach who is the
model of what a coach should
be.

He gives his players guidance
both on and off the ﬁeld, and is a
mentor to his players, especially
when they need him the most.
His no-nonsense approach to
both football and life is a calm-
ing inﬂuence during some of the
turbulent events that occur in the
show.

Some of the most powerful
and inspiring scenes involve him
talking to his players. All of the
football players and teenagers
are new characters, who were
not in the movie.

Do yourself a favor, and
watch “Friday Night Lights.”
No other show comes even close
to capturing the complete spec-
trum of human interactions and
emotions the way that this one
does.

If you watch this show you
will laugh, you will cry, your
heart will break for the char-
acters and most important, the
characters will inspire and uplift
you.

There is still time to catch
up before the fourth season pre-
mieres this summer on NBC.
Watch the show. There are so
few good shows on television
today that you would be denying
yourself one of the greatest plea-
sures available to you.

crafted a better antagonist to the
Health Center.

Just watch out though, be-
cause there is no way that you
are successfully having a Patrick
Bateman kind of love session if
you have one too many of these
babies. In other words, accom-
pany every can with at least an
extra ten minutes in the gym.

The good news about these
drinks, on the other hand, is that
you are ensured to be heartily
bouncing along to DJ Tiesto all
night due to both beverages’ gar-
gantuan caffeine levels.

Both Four Loko and Max do
apparently taste wonderful and
have such delightful, myriad

ﬂavors that you are sure to be
pleasantly surprised whenever
you legally purchase them.

However, even I have to say
that it would be best to proceed
with caution. Like Chi Psi Late
Night, it’s best done every once
in a while rather than every
night.

Now, you’ve no doubt heard
some bad press about all of these

drinks. Pretty much every sin-
gle campus administrator will
tell you that these drinks are as
positive as Tear Night.

In November, the FDA gave
all 30 companies who put caf-
feine in alcoholic drinks an ulti-
matum about ﬁnding a test that
shows a positive correlation
between putting alcohol in caf-
feinated beverages. I know that

you’re not going to believe this,
but none of the companies could
ﬁnd any positive health effects
about mixing caffeine and alco-
hol. Yes, it’s also true that drink-
ing these drinks is downright ter-
rible for your heart.

But here’s the problem with
all that logic: what’s positive
about most ofthe stuff people do
here?

What’s positive about ripping
shots, playing pong and doing
keg stands‘? -

What’s positive about driving

“ to Wendy’s at ll:58‘ p.m. only

three hours after you had din-
ner?
What’s positive about stand-

ing outside in the freezing cold
at County Seat waiting for that
extra beer at 1:30?

If there’s nothing positive
about any of these things, then
why do we do them? The simple
answer is because all of those
things are either fun or somehow
serve to make our fun night just .
a little bit more exciting.

l’m not writing this article to
get you to Max out on life. Nor
am I going to write a diatribe
against morally irresponsible as-
pects of your life that will make
me a pariah to some and a hero
to the constituency that simply
wants to make themselves feel
better for not being like “those
people.” i

I think that if you do want to
have a fun pre-game, maybe one
of these drinks could help your
night out a little bit.

Just remember, too many keg
stands, Wendy’s runs or freezing
cold nights can all lead you to
not having fun,just like shotgun-
ning a Four Loko can lead to you
not having fun.

That being said, they still are
pretty damn tasty.

Oh, and of course wait until
you’re 21 to read this article. But
you of course wouldn’t fathom
doing something illegal. What’s
positive about illegality?

Eargasmic new tunes from WLUR

Washington and Lee campus radio oﬂers three of the station library is hot new albums fresh from the airwaves to you

By WLUR Staff
STAFF WRITERS

The cast of classic albums
for 2010 is already piling up.
Here are some more to add to the
stack: '

Beach House
Teen Dream (Sub Pop)

2009 was undoubtedly a ban-
ner year for music; is it possible
that 2010 could duplicate its pre-
decessor? Here’s one key simi-
larity: a record that comes out in
January dazzles from start to ﬁn-
ish, shows that the band behind
it is moving toward pop without
sacriﬁcing any artistic merit, and
withstands whatever great albums
the rest of the year throws at it
to take its rightful place on year-
end best-of lists. As with Animal
Collective’s Merriweather Post
Pavilion, that has happened and
will happen for Beach House’s
Teen Dream, the Maryland duo’s
third full-length, and first for in-
die superlabel Sub Pop.

In the spirit of full disclo-
sure, we at WLUR are big fans
of Beach House. Devotion, the
band’s second LP, was a favor-

ite record of 2008. We had ex-
tremely high expectations for the
album, and it exceeds them in
every way. Victoria Legrand and
Alex Scally have created a work
that is as captivating as their ﬁrst
two records, but at the same time
more accessible than the pop-
piest tunes that they’d put out
before. As alluringly gloomy as
Grizzly Bear’s Yellow House—
Legrand is a frequent collabora-
tor with that band~or Summer
Sun-era Yo La Tengo, this record
is still so easy to get into that it’s
scary. (Devotion was deﬁnitely
a grower.) Legrand’s vocals,
which fall somewhere between
Nico and Hope Sandoval, are a
bit more prominent here, soaring
over the band’s layers of organ,
keyboards, guitar, percussion
and bells.

There isn’t a weak link on this
record, but some favorites are
“Norway,” “Walk in the Park,”
“l0 Mile Stereo,” “Used to Be”
and “Silver Soul.”

the style that is quickly becoming
Midlake’s trademark—a blend

Original, yet steeped in some

It’s been described as a “record
that’s bigger, deeper, more com-
plex and more direct than any-
thing Los Campesinos! has re-
corded to date”~—but thankfully
this doesn’t mean that the delight-
ful brass is gone or the sound is
totally different. It’s simply fuller

overly cluttered. You manage to
hear all the members and all the

ments). Start with tracks “There
Are Listed Buildings,” “A Heat

packed on Saturday night with
supporters and onlookers, who
cheered and booed at the 27
groups that participated.

Starting at 9 p.m., hosts Chris
Washington and David Gilbert
first introduced the Greek house
moms, who got a little sassy this
year. Flaunting their boas and
throwing fake money into the
crowd brought cheers from all‘,
especially those who reside in
the Greek houses with them.

Though competition was
tough, Phi Psi won ﬁrst place with
a high-energy dance to “Good
Vibrations” by Marky Mark and
the Funky Bunch. Their perfor-
mance had many intricate dance
moves, but the human steps, the
high jump between legs and the
ending (when the dancers tore
their shirts to reveal. their Greek
letters on their chests) deﬁnitely
stood out.

Second place went to the
Alpha Delta Pi group that per-
formed a well-rehearsed piece to
a mash-up of songs. The crowd
fell in love with their clever cho-
reography when Taylor Swift’s
“Love Story” came on and the
girls held up their ADPi diamond
hand sign to symbolize an en-
gagement ring.

KLAZICS, always a crowd
favorite, took home third place.
Though Lady Gaga was a com-
mon theme in many ofthe dances
throughout the night, KLAZICS’
Gaga had the most authentic hair,
outﬁt and moves. However, the

Phi guys got into it and knew
how to please the crowd. The
stripping of their shirts, which
they threw to the audience, only
added to the loud cheering.

Kappa Alpha Theta had ev-
eryone laughing with their foam
star costumes, and Kappa Kappa
Gamma pulled out some surpris-
ingly thug hip-hop moves in their
second performance.

Sigma Chi’s excellent song
choice of “Dirty Talk” by Wyn-
ter Gordon caught everyone’s at-
tention but ended up making the
audience cringe, as man thongs"
were exposed toward the end of
their dance.

A personal favorite, the Beta
Theta Pi guys performed “She
Wolf’ by Shakira and had the
costumes down to a T. A large
cage prop was even used, simi-
lar to the one that appears in the
music video.

Phi Delta Theta deserves
credit for wearing such tight
pants, and Phi Kappa Sigma pro-
vided an interesting end to the
night after a creative remake of
the Taylor Swift music video,
“You Belong With Me.”

All the proceeds from Lip
Sync help to ﬁght hunger in
Rockbridge County. Each group
that entered paid a fee of $200
that goes towards SARAH, and
students who came to watch paid
an entrance fee of $8.

Men is basketball beats Randolph-Macon College 65-5 7, defeating the Yellow Jackets at Randolph-Macon for the ﬁrst time in over 50 years

By Hank Nathan V‘
STAFF WRITER

For the ﬁrst time in over 50 years, the
Washington and Lee men’s basketball
team defeated ninth-ranked Randolph-
Macon College on the road. The Gener-
als knocked off the Yellow Jackets 65-
57. The Generals‘ then continued their
momentum against Randolph College,
winning 64-46, to sweep the two-game
road trip.

On Wednesday, the Blue and White
put an end to some negative history by
winning at Randolph-Macon for the ﬁrst
time since the 1958-1959 season.

“I am extremely proud of our guys
for ending that streak,” said Coach
Adam Hutchinson. “Fifty years is a long
time to go without winning at an oppos-
ing team’s gym. Our guys were very
focused and _committed to getting that
win.”

The Generals opened up the scoring
on a fade-away jumper from the foul
line by ﬁrst-year forward Jeremy Adkins
who got a rare start. Randolph-Macon
immediately responded with a layup,
but Adkins scored again on the next pos-
session. The game remained tight early
on and the score was knotted at 14-14
after senior forward Zac White scored
on a layup.

W&L scored on its next two posses-
sions on a layup by senior forward An-
drew Payne and a dunk by ﬁrst-year for-
ward JD Ey after stealing the ball at half
court. The score was 18-14 at 1 1:12 and-
the Generals would never look back, not
relinquishing the lead for the rest of the
game.

The Generals continued to advance
their lead as senior forward Ben Goetsch
and Payne combined for 16 points in the
ﬁrst half. With six seconds remaining
in the ﬁrst frame, White hit a 3-pointer
from the right wing, making the score
41-30 at the break.

In the ﬁrst half, W&L shot a stagger-
ing 66.7 percent from the ﬁeld and con-
nected on seven of seven free throws.
Despite averaging 20 turnovers per
game this season, the Generals had only
six turnovers in the ﬁrst frame, while the
Yellow Jackets had nine.

“Concentration,” said junior guard
Jason Cimino, was how the squad cut
down on turnovers. “Our team has suf-
fered from lack of focus all season, and
that lack of focus causes turnovers. Dur-
ing the Randolph-Macon game, every-
one was paying attention and very fo-
cused, and, therefore, we didn’t turn the

ball over.”

Midway through the ﬁrst half, the
Generals switched up their defense to
a 1-3-1 zone and, after the 13:18 mark,
Randolph-Macon shot six of 18 from
the ﬁeld.

“They were having a real off night
from outside and the zone really ex-
ploited that,” said Cimino. “We have so
many long, athletic guys which makes
the zone much more effective.”

In the second half, Adkins once again
began the scoring for the Generals, but
then W&L’s shooting cooled off and
the team was unable to hit another shot
from the ﬁeld for nearly 1 1 minutes. The
Yellow Jackets capitalized off of the
poor shooting and went on a 17-6 run
to deadlock the score at 47-47 with 8:07
remaining. W&L and Randolph-Macon
then traded off free throws and the score
stayed tied at 49-49.

When the Blue and White needed a
basket the most, it was Goetsch, one of
the team’s senior captains, who ended
the Generals’ drought from the ﬁeld on a
three-pointer from the left wing and a la-
yup off of a feed from Ey. Goetsch said
the key to not falling behind was playing
with a high intensity level.

“Before the game, we had talked
about keeping up our intensity for the
whole game,” said Goetsch who tied a
game-high in scoring with 17. “No mat-
ter what the score was, we were not sur-
prised or fazed that the game got close
in the second half.”

Cimino extended the lead to 56-49
with 5:22 to go on a layup after grabbing
an offensive rebound. Randolph-Macon

_ converted a layup of its own on the fol-

lowing possession but was never able to
get any closer down the stretch, the ﬁnal
score being 65-57. ,

In the effort, the Generals shot 44.7
percent from the ﬁeld and held the Yel-
low Jackets to 37.7 percent shooting, in-
cluding one of 23 from beyond the arc.
During the scoring drought, W&L was
aided by excellent foul shooting, con-
verting on 20 of 24 attempts. Also, the
team forced l7 turnovers for Randolph-
Macon and only had 12 of their own.

“We have been in some tough games
this season and over the last couple of
years,” said Coach Hutchinson after the
game. “We have responded quite well
to adversity all year long, and this game
was no different.”

Following the upset victory over

Randolph-Macon, the Generals trav-
elled to Randolph College on Saturday.

The game started out as a defensive
battle as both teams struggled to score.
The score was 24-20 at the break. The
game remained tight for the ﬁrst eight
minutes of the second stanza, but the
Generals eventually broke the game
open. The score was 36-34 before W&L
went on a 13-3 run, making the score
49-37. Adkins punctuated the lead with
a three-pointer oﬁf a steal with 6:44 to
go.
Randolph narrowed the deﬁcit to
eight points, but could not get any clos-
er. From the 5:24 mark on, the Generals
scored 15 of the game’s next 20 points
to win 64-46.

Cimino, Goetsch and White each had
11 points apiece in the contest, while
ﬁrst-year Hans Harris contributed nine
points off the bench. Once again, the
Generals minimized turnovers by com-
mitting only nine, while forcing 17 by
the Wildcats.

The W&L men’s basketball team is
now 12-6 overall and 4-5 in the Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference.

Saintsvs. Colts: What’s the key to victory?

Expect high-scoring and an emphasis on the receiving corps from two virtually identical offensive teams in Superbowl XLI V

By Adam cancryn
STAFF WRITER

And so it is set. Super Bowl XLIV
will pit the Indianapolis Colts against
the New Orleans Saints. Manning vs.
Brees. Offense vs. offense. First one to
40 wins.

In the days leading up to the game,
every aspect of these two teams_will in-
evitably be examined, pored over and
picked at in search of some obscure clue
as to who will have the upper hand. Of-
fenses will be compared to defenses,
players matched up against their posi-
tional counterparts and coaching strate-
gies scrutinized. ‘

Countless storylines will emerge, but
perhaps the most compelling one is also
the simplest: the Saints and the Colts are
nearly identical in every way.

It is no secret that Indianapolis’ path
to victory is paved through the air. The
team averaged more than 282 yards per
game through the air, good enough for
second among all teams. Oftheir 14 vic-
tories, star QB Peyton Manning threw
for at least 300 yards nine times. He
completed touchdown passes to ﬁve dif-

ferent receivers, and wide receiver Reg-
gie Wayne and tight end Dallas Clark
each notched 100 receptions.

The only team more committed to
passing, it seems, is the Saints. Employ-
ing a similar aerial attack, New Orleans
equaled the Colts’ 34 passing scores and
supplemented it with 11 completions of
40+ yards.

They boast their own accomplished
signal caller, Drew Brees. Cast off
by the Chargers ﬁve years ago, Brees
moved to post-Katrina Louisiana and
promptly ignited the offense. His deadly
accuracy put him atop all quarterbacks

this year in completion percentage and

passer rating. v
Both have dispelled the notion that to
win in the NFL you must run the ball.
The Colts have perhaps the worst run-
ning game in the league. Veteran Joseph
Addai and newcomer Donald Brown
combined forjust 1,294 yards, a league
low. But it’s not like they had much ofa
chance to establish their worth: the Colts
averaged just 22.9 rushing attempts a

game. By comparison, their last playoff
opponent, the Jets, ran almost 40 times
each week. ‘

New Orleans possesses a stable of
running backs, but they are just as much
receivers as runners. Pierre Thomas
and Reggie Bush combined to make
86 catches out of the backﬁeld. The run
game is used primarily as a strategic
change of pace, something to break up
the monotony of Brees’ throws. For just
the second time in 20 years, both Super
Bowl teams are without a 1,000-yard
rusher.

If the Saints and Colts have merely
ignored the run game, then they’ve
demonstrated disgust at the concept of
defense. The two are the only playoff
teams ranked in the bottom 15 in total
defense, giving up more than 339 yards
per game. The Colts’ run defense was a
sieve, with opponents averaging nearly
127 yards on the ground. The Saints’ de-
ﬁciencies came in the secondary, which
ranked 26th against the pass.

The ﬁnal score of this Super Bowl

will certainly not be 9-6.

So what will determine the outcome
of a matchup of two identical teams?
Unsurprisingly, it will likely come down
to the play of two similar groups: the
receiving corps. Indianapolis and New
Orleans have found success through the
air by relying on previously unheralded
receivers; players that, when turned
loose in a pass-centric environment,
have flourished.

To win, the Saints’ trio of Marques
Colsten, Devery Henderson and Robert
Meachem must be the ones to move the
ball down the ﬁeld.

With defenders keying on Pro Bowl-
ers Wayne and Clark, the Colts will need
to look to previous unknowns Pierre
Garcon and Austin Collie.

If you don’t immediately recognize
those names, don’t worry; most scouts
hadn’t either when they broke into the
league. In fact, Meachem was the only
one selected in the ﬁrst round of his re-
spective draft, as the 27th pick. The av-
erage draft position for the other four is

158.

This year, however, they have made a
name for themselves. Collie emerged as
a reliable receiver opposite Wayne after
the Colts lost a starter early in the sea-
son. He made headlines most recently
after catching seven balls for 123 yards
in the AFC championship, including
a game-changing 46-yard touchdown.
Garcon, who did not start a game last
year, has become Manning’s go-to guy
in the playoffs. He leads Indianapolis
with 16 receptions.

Compared to the Colts’ young ﬂy-
ers, Colston, Henderson and Meachem
are seasoned veterans. The unit has de-
veloped a chemistry with Brees that is
rarely disrupted.

The pieces are in place for a display
of offensive ﬁreworks not normally seen
on Super Bowl Sunday. The only ques-
tions that remain are how many points
each team can score and which group
of unheralded receivers will swing the
game in their favor.

Women on the rise

The Lady Generals continue their success with a 69-66 win over Guilford College

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

Sophomore forward Becca Bolton out-
did herself again, and Washington and Lee
beat Guilford College 69-66 in a back and
forth battle on Friday night.

W&L stretched its winning streak to
four games and ran their record to 9-7
overall and a sparkling 8-4 conference re-
cord with the win. The Quakers beat the
Generals 55-52 on December 2nd, but the
tables were turned this time around.

It took a while for both offenses to get
going and the ﬁrst half ended all tied up at
26-26. Lead changes were plentiful in the
ﬁrst stanza as both teams struggled to seize
control of the game. Once the second half
started though, the ﬁreworks began. Head
coach Mandy King must have said all the
right things at half time, because the Gen-
erals came ﬂying out of the gate and went
on a 17-3 run.

The ﬁrst seven minutes of the second
half was all W&L. The defense forced six
Guilford turnovers during that span and
the Generals’ offense capitalized on their
miscues. With 13 minutes left, W&L had a
comfortable 43-29 lead. But Guilford was
not going down without a ﬁght. With 47
seconds left, Jazlyn Gibbs sunk two free
throws for the Quakers to put Guilford
ahead by a score of 66-65.

Fundamentals won this game for W&L.
Bolton knocked down a free throw to tie
the game at 66-66 with 33 seconds left.
F irst-year Katy Wilson drew a foul and
made one of two shots at the charity stripe
to put the Generals ahead. And Bolton iced
the game by grabbing a rebound, drawing
afoul and sinking two more free throws
with a mere four seconds left on the clock,
ensuring the 69-66 victory.

Bolton, who has been a double-double
machine as of late, continued that trend
with her ninth double-digit point and re-
bound performance of the year. Bolton
ﬁnished the game with 31 points and 13
rebounds. She was extremely efﬁcient in
this game, making 10 of 12 ﬁeld goal at-
tempts and sinking all ll free throws.

‘ For the game, the Generals shot 89 per-
cent for free throws (24-27) to make up
for a dismal shooting performance from
long range. Fundamentals outweighed
ﬂair in this contest as the near-plerfect free

throw shooting exhibition made it easy
to overlook a poor 15 percent three-point
ﬁeld goal performance.

“It was a great team effort,” said junior
forward Felice Herman, who added 14
points and ﬁve rebounds to the win. “The
individual efforts were complimented per-
fectly by our chemistry on the ﬂoor. That
whole game was about revenge for the
loss the ﬁrst time. Even though we did not
match up great with Guilford, we_got the
stops we needed on defense and made the
shots that counted on offense.” .

As postseason play advances rapidly,

W&L is coming together at just the right
time. The team faces another tough test on
Tuesday and put their winning streak on
the line versus Virginia Wesleyan.

Herman said she is already looking for-
ward to the next challenge.

“We know we have to be just as tough
when playing against Wesleyan,” she said.
“That will be another great challenge for
us and will just be another opportunity for
revenge for the one-point loss to them last
time.”

That contest will tip offat 7 p.m. at Vir-
ginia Wesleyan.

Extending
education

W&L students volunteer at
local elementary school

By Chelsea Stevenson
STAFF WRITER

While many W&L students are involved on
campus, others extend their dedication off campus
at Lexington’s Harrington Waddell Elementary
School. Located just an eight-minute walk from
W&L’s campus, Waddell Elementary school offers
volunteer positions for a large number of W&L stu-
dents.

Students often seek internship hours for W&L’s
education classes or st dent-teaching opportunities,
but most students simply volunteer to tutor in a va-
riety of subjects ranging from math classes to art
enrichment programs.

According to Kevin Kendall, the Gifted Edu-
cation Coordinator at Waddell, the most popular
programs that W&L students help out with are the
weekly “tech time” sessions, where students help
ﬁrst grade classes become accustomed to using
computers and other forms of technology and the
writing mentorship program. This program features
advanced student writers at W&L, or students who
have enrolled in creative writing courses.

The Junior Great Books Book Club is also popu-_

lar among W&L students. Elementary school stu-
dents are encouraged to read age appropriate litera-
ture and discuss its literary forms, as they would in
middle or high school.

Kindergarteners at Waddell also beneﬁt from the
work of W&L students. Kristin Tomlin, Waddell’s
school counselor, is in charge of the Kindergaiten
Readers Program. Currently, over 30 undergraduate
and law students give 30 minutes of their time to
listen to kindergarteners read short books.

First-year Ashley Astolﬁ helps kindergarteners
with their reading speed. She said she enjoys work-
ing with children and seeing them improve.

’ ‘‘It’s so much better when you get to know them,
because it makes their success yours, too. lt’s really
something to celebrate,” Astolﬁ said.

Tomlin also coordinates after-school tutoring and
the Homework Help Program for Waddell students,
many of whom suffer from difﬁculties in school or

at home. Over 25 W&L students tutor‘ individual‘

students in kindergarten through ﬁfth grade for one
hour a week.

Both administrators at Waddell give praise to
W&L students for their work. Some student tutors
are unable to commit to tutoring on a weekly basis,
but that has been the only problem.

“Our volunteers are genuinely invested,” said
Tomlin.

Students who are interested in giving their time to
Waddell should contact the Nabors Service League
Children’s Contact Chair, junior Kate Donnelly.

Donnelly serves as a link between W&L students
and tutoring opportunities in Rockbridge County.
Working with Kendall, Tomlin and local parents,
Donnelly uses her connections through her two var-
sity sports teams and her sorority to f. id volunteers.

Surprisingly, she said, she has found great suc-
cess in Campus Notices as well. Donnelly’s in-
volvement with the Nabors Service League started
last year when she served as a reading volunteer at
Waddell and Lexington’s Yellow Brick Road Early
Learning Center.

Along with her Nabors work, Donnelly plays
both ﬁeld hockey and lacrosse, leaving her no time
to volunteer herself.

“I love kids, though. lt’s really rewarding, so this
is one way I can help them,” she said.

Donnelly anticipates a future career in public
policy or community development, but she plans to
continue her role in Nabors next year. I’

“I love being able to connect students with the
local community and see how many students are so
eager to help,” she said. /

W&L students seem to genuinely enjoy their
time at Waddell. Kendall is grateful that the volun-
teers are notjust seniors trying to rack up activities
for their resumes, but underclassmen as well.

“The vast majority of volunteers want to be in-
volved in the community and work with kids. I get a
sense that they want to come back year after year,”
Kendall said.

Waddell is always looking for volunteers in
classes or after-school programs, for a variety of
lengths of time. Those interested in volunteering
can Contact Kate Donnelly at (donnellyk11@maz'l.
wluedu). .

   

 

Provost June“/lprille issues half a snow’ day;

Rumors created a ﬂurry around
Lexington this past week, with talk
of an impending winter wallop. The
storm hit Friday, accumulating on
what remained from the previous
weekend. Virginia Governor Bob
McDonnell declared a state of emer-

ferent,” she said.

facility workers who arrived first on
campus and thus saw conditions ﬁrst.

_most inclement weather. Dining Ser-
vice workers make up part of the Es-

nated employees who know ahead of

Lexington amassed nearly 8.3 inches of.snow by 9 a.m. on Saturday, Feb. 6, according to
the National Weather Service.

gency, the second this year. Kroger
was chaotic, stores in the heart of
Lexington closed and a heightened
sense of anticipation swirled around.

Provost June Aprille, whose job
includes canceling class in the event
of bad weather, attributed the hype to
Lexington’s relative lack of experi-
ence with heavy snow.

“The town and county have not
invested heavily in snow removal
equipment as would be typical for
more wintery climates, and local
roads may not be cleared promptly,”
she explained in an email.

With such extreme forecasts,
Washington and Lee administration
met Thursday morning to discuss ac-
tion for Friday, but Aprille typically
makes decisions by 5:00 or 6:00 a.m.
the morning ofthe storm.

“I try to make the best decision I

their commute was and how things
are looking.” At 5:00 a.m. Friday,
the snow was still light, temperatures
were above freezing and no major
accumulation was expected before
noon, so administration deemed a
12:00 p.m. closing sufﬁcient, pre-
serving morning classes. Students
received an email at 8:40 a.m. con-
ﬁrming that afternoon classes would
not take place. '

Aprille acknowledged that deci-»

sions were somewhat rushed and the
cutofftime should have been 12:10,
the oﬁicial end of D-block. She said,
“I hope students did not get up en
masse and walk out at noon!”

Many were worried about D-Hall,
especially after the issues caused by

the December 18th snowstorm. Dean ‘

of Students Dawn Watkins explained
that because D-Hall is a necessary

the regular school calendar, running
D-Hall was a matter of maintaining
current production instead of power-
ing back up.

Though D-Hall continued ser-
vice, sorority dining was modiﬁed:
regular meals were cancelled for the
day. An improvised deli bar was ar-
ranged, but most sorority women
scrambled to restaurants or just ate at
their off-campus houses. .

Getting to and from off-campus
houses was not an easy feat. Anyone
‘who did not feel conﬁdent travel-
ling was encouraged to use personal
judgment, even in regard to a class.
Junior Caroline Bovay, who lives
in the country, said she appreciated
“the University’s policy regarding
inclement winter weather: only drive
to campus if you feel you can do it
safely.” Even though she came to

STEELE BURROW/ Staff Photographer

students push through inclement weather

campus at 8:15 a.m., well before the
noon cutoff, she said “it was com-
forting to have that backing from the
University.”

Bovay said she worried about
getting to campus from the Windfall
area without four-wheel drive., al-
though she granted that roads were
better maintained for this storm than
December’s. “It seems like the city is
far more prepared this time around,”
though getting from her house to a
thoroughfare was still a challenge.

Thankfully, she arrived on cam-
pus successfully, but she saw cars
that were not as lucky, citing “two
students’ cars that either spun out of
control or skidded into a ditch.” She
sais she wished that the University
cancelled classes earlier so that these
students would not have risked com-
ing to campus at all.

On the other hand, students who
live on campus found getting to class
easy, as snow plows worked through
the night to clear paths between
buildings. Plowing shifts occurred at
3:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. Snow shov-
elers and public safety olﬁcers also
fall under the EPS umbrella, ensur-
ing their presence on campus despite
the storm.

Shoveling ensured pedestrian
safety, but evening transportation
was questionable at best. Clay Cole-
man, Director of Student Affairs
and Greek Life, spoke to fraternity
leadership about risk management
due to the severe weather, especial-
ly discouraging driving. Freshmen
pledges were banned from driving to
and from fraternity functions. Like-
wise, Traveller did not run because
the University could not ensure pas-
senger safety. j

However, the lack of drivers did
not prevent students from going out.
If anything, the snow encouraged
parties, as the weekend began earlier
than anticipated. Students went sled-
ding during the day and walked to
parties at night. So while administra-
tion overcame a signiﬁcant technical
concern, W&L students enjoyed an
out-of-the-ordinary long weekend. ‘

Washington.

budget reveals an increase of
$175 billion in personal income
taxes, a $117 billion increase in
corporate income taxes, and only
a miniscule decrease of $21 bil-
lion in discretionary spending
(WSJ, 2/2).

Obama has made a big deal
about ﬁscal responsibility, but
he still ﬁnds it too difﬁcult to cut

do business in America (a legal
and tax environment favorable to
growth and freer enterprise) will
greatly diminish.

The most damaging com-
ponent of the new business tax
would be the elimination of
tax advantages to do business
abroad. These advantages were
created in order to allow for a

corporation to not pay taxes on
oversea earnings if the oversea

country in question required tax- -

es on the same earnings. Origi-
nally, the business tax eliminated
double taxation on the corpora-
tions that hire hundreds of thou-
sands, if not millions, of Ameri-
can workers.

Under Obama’s 2011 budget,
the United States will be the only
country in the world to tax the
oversea earnings of its corpora-
tions without provisions to pre-
vent double taxation.

Increasing these taxes will re-
sult in the ﬁring of thousands of
American workers. Sounds like
a great plan to revive growth and
decrease the unemployment rate.
But wait, I forgot, the govem—
ment can take all of this new rev-

‘ enue and spend it more eﬁiciently
with respect to employment than
any corporation can. That’s why
there was the stimulus package,
and why the unemployment rate
has fallen dramatically.

Individual American taxpay-
ers have even more to fear in this
budget than simply the prospect
of losing a job. Personal income
taxes for the top two brackets,
after the expiration of tax cuts

on those making more than
$250,000 a year expire, will see
increases on the marginal tax
brackets from 33 to 35 percent,
and from 36 to 39.6 percent. This
alone will stiﬁe spending and in-
vestment from the upper incomes
in America, but the beatings con-
tinue to all income levels across
every tax bracket.

Obama also wants fewer in-

vestors to invest in long-term-

holdings. That is the only con-
clusion that can be reached from
the increase in capital gains and
dividend taxes from 15 to 20 per-
cent. The new budget also seeks
to include earnings from interest
(from savings accounts) treated
as regular income, and as a re-
sult, taxed as such.

This directive hits each and
every family in America but

undermines the incentives built

into the prior tax code which
both saves and invests in com-

panies that employ millions of

Americans. Increasing the cost
of working, much like increas-
ing the costs of doing business
in America, is one of the worst
ways to boost the economy.

The U.S. economy is still ane-
mic, at best. Paralyzed by uncer-

tainty, stemming in part from the
temporary and artiﬁcial stimulus
from Washington, investors have
just received the worst possible
news: capital gains and dividend
taxes are going to be raised, on
top of the already catastrophic
possibility of strengthening la-
bor unions through card check,
preferential treatment for orga-

' nized labor under new healthcare
legislation, and near limitless in-
creases on business regulation
and taxation.

The government’s role in the
economy should focus on creat-
ing a safe and stable system of
rules in which a market economy
can prosper. The current trend
of federal regulation is acting
completely counter to this phi-
losophy, and Keynesian inspired
policy has again taken a hold of
Washington.

Ifthis policy is continued,job
creation and investor conﬁdence
is likely to continue to stagnate.

Dems’ problems come from policies, not lack of backbone

Democrats have much

By Abel Delgado
COLUMNIST

Summer Lollie was half right
when she said it’s been a tough
year for liberal Democrats. It’s
been an extremely tough year for
Democrats. The reason for that is
that they can no longer claim to
be liberal.

Pundits tend to throw around
the words “liberal” and “con-
servative” with little concern
over their original meanings.
President George W. Bush was
a “conservative” who aimed at

changing everything from the
national security structure, to
public education, to the tax code,
to the Constitution. What exactly
was he trying to conserve? His-
torically, liberals have been the
ones who have been pro-indi-
vidual freedom and anti-govem-
ment control.

What then, is so liberal about

President Obama’s current agen- »

da? Democrats are no longer lib-
eral. They are social-Democrats,

I recognize socialist is a
bad word in this country, but it
shOuldn’t be. If that is what you
are, then that is what you should
call yourself.

The real problem for Demo-
crats is that, regardless of what
they call themselves, Americans

you do with your life as long as
it doesn’t affect them.

George W. Bush’s actions fol-
lowed the completely opposite
mindset of those sentiments. That
is why Democrats regained pow-
er. Nominating centrist “blue-
dog” Democrats, who had very
little in common with the out-

bigger issues than Summer Lollie is proposed lack of assertion

through. A bill that gives cover-
age to less than 10 percent of all
Americans while costing well
over $800 billion ~ that’s eleven
zeroes for those of you counting
at home - is not going to make
very many voters happy.

have their platform ﬁgured out
and they simply do not agree

they don’t like the government

meaning they don’t care what

The reason the Wall Street
bailout turned out to be such a
misuse of money is because Re-
publicans and Democrats got to-
gether to make their rich donors
happy. Reasonable opposition
was ignored.

A similar problem happened
with the stimulus bill that only
ended up further stimulating our
already-stimulated national debt.

Obstruction is a great thing
when political leaders, of either
party, manipulate crises to get
shameful bills passed, and when
the vast majority of legislators
do not even read the bills they
are voting for.

So if Democrats “grow a
pair,” and try to push their agenda
through, Republicans will be cel-
ebrating in November. The only
thing that will get ﬁnished is the
Democratic majority.

THE RING-TUM PHI ° 3

 

opinions

Each fraternity’s weekend custom for greeting the day

After a long night of partying, every fraternity chooses an incredibly unique way to welcome the next morning

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

   

 
  
  
    

 
  

Beta — Rolling out ofbed with
no clothes on, the typical Beta
immediately goes to his closet to
pick out the proper outﬁt for the
day. He strenuously avoids the
shower or any kind of deodorant
in favor of the much more popu-
lar body odor dujour.

Once the closet is opened, he
chooses from his myriad differ-
ent clothing selections. Should
he wear a throwback Carmelo
jersey or a Lebron away jersey?
He shrugs andjust throws on any
old ambiguous basketball jersey
accompanied by a ﬁtted cap,
which works well for some and
poorly for others.

Before he calls up his chick
that he will inevitably settle for,
he gets into a ﬁght with a lamp
post for “looking at him weird"
and “talking shit.”

KA— Smelling something un-
pleasant in the air, the KA leaps
out of bed and looks around vig-
orously to make sure that there
isn’t anyone watching him from
afar.

He tweaks his neck a little and
heads into the shower. He can’t
really ﬁgure out all the blasted
knobs that make the water go, so
instead he favors the much more
efﬁcient head-butt-of-the—wall to
get the water started. For some
strange reason, he can‘t stop
scratching his neck. It must have
been from a hook-up the night
before or something like that.

Even though it is eight in the
morning and he’s only slept for
three hours, the KA is still tre-
mendously excited about the
upcoming football game. In fact,
he can’t stop talking about it. But
before he leaves to attend, he
calls up his ENT doctor to set up
an appointment.

Lambda — The Lambda
wakes up with a frustrated
scream. He cannot believe that
he forgot the next number in the
Fibonacci sequence after 89 and
144. He scours the intemet, us-
ing W&L-approved sources of
course, to ﬁnd the next number,
233.

After breathing a strong sigh
of relief, he remembers that yes,
he was at a party last night, and
once again the worry sets in. He
now browses Facebook, looking
for that one incriminating photo
that will inevitably lead to him
getting kicked off the SJC or EC,
which he knows will jeopardize
any dream he has of becoming
senator one day.

Luckily there is not a single
picture ofhim with his Sam Ad-
ams, so he can now get changed
into his suit for a proper brunch
on the town.

likes to sleep in a little. He could
wake up, and he’s been tempted
to all morning, but he keeps re-
turning to his favorite dream of
becoming the grandmaster of
Kappa Sig.

In this dream, the Pi Phi house
continues to endlessly burn, and
while he gets mountains and
mountains of sympathy, this Pi
Phi can now live in the house
across from KA that he always
dreamed of.

Waking up with a smile, he
goes downstairs to try and help
clean his house before remem-

hunting in the lonely, wooded

However, he makes sure that
there isjust enough flow coming
out ofhis camo hat for Kappas to
properly notice.

SNU — Right around 7:30
or so, the Snu wakes up with a
hangoverebut not enough of a
hangover to let that beloved GPA
falter.

He wouldn’t normally wake
up this early, but TNT is show-
ing an all-day marathon of“Lord

the room to try and establish
exactly where he is. He realizes
that the other person in the room
is still sleeping comfortably on
their bed.

He quietly puts on his sweat-
shirt and writes a party email on
the sleeping person’s computer.
Before opening the door, he
drops a couple offliers inside the
doorway just to make sure that
everyone is completely positive
that, yes, something with some
kind of theme is happening at
Pole “Extreme” tonight.

As he walks out of the Gra-
ham-Lees ﬁrst-ﬂoor hallway, he

you are the most vulnerable, and therefore the easiest to classify.

 

bering that the house was al-
ready spotless by around 10:30
the night before. Free at last,
he decides to immediately start
planning a party with the obliga-
tory late night plan of Pole One
around nine or so.

PiKA — The ABBA alarm
clock sounds and the PiKA
springs out ofbed more energetic
than the night before.

He joins his friends for a
quick game of handball to start
the day. He thinks that they can
get around 15 to 20 games in
before noon. but he can only get
four in before getting too tired.

Now sweaty, he decides to
take a long, soothing bubble bath
to exfoliate those pores and re-
lax a little. He attempts to shave,
but then he remembers that he
doesn‘t have any facial hair.

He throws on his V-neck that
matches hisjeans perfectly. Now
fully clean and exercised, he can
return to College ACB for the
day‘s entertaimnent.

SAE — The typical SAE for-
got to turn off the SEC Network
last night, so highlights of Mark
lngram’s touchdown against
Texas force him to wake up a
little earlier than expected.

Groggy from three too many
mixes of SoCo and Evan Wil-
liams, his head is left in a dire
state. To feel better, he bypasses
his Lynyrd Skynyrd album in
favor of some quality Old Crow
Medicine Show. After getting his
daily exercise from the ensuing
air guitar session, he showers and
dons his hunting gear and camou-

of the Rings,” and there is abso-
lutely no way that he will miss
another shot of Gandalf turning
from gray to white.

After having a little chat with
LexPo about the thorough preva-
lence of indecent acts in Lexing-
ton, he showers thoroughly, mak-
ing sure to hit every pore with the
penetrating ProActiv solution.

Today will be a day for not
going outside, so he shuts the
blinds and puts on his vintage
Darth Vader T-shirt, puts some
buttered popcorn in the micro-
wave, turns on DirectTV and en-

joys his weekend.

Sig Ep — Normally, SAE‘s
blasting ofOld Crow would im-
mediately awaken the Sig Ep,
but unfortunately his ears are
still ringing from the gnarly jam
session the night before, when he
and all of his friends seamlessly
held the same jive rhythm for
three solid hours.

He waits until the ringing in
his ears stop before he scours
YouTube to ﬁnd the next come-
dian to invite over to W&L on
bchalfof GAB.

Being the “new age" frater-
nity, the Sig Ep foregoes party
planning in favor ofcalling Tick-
etmaster to see if Phish is hav-
ing a concert in the area anytime
soon. The stained paper with the
unicorn on his desk says they
might.

Sig Chi — The Sigma Chi
wakes up in a room foreign to
him. He has a dead arm from
spending such a long time on a
dormitory ﬁoor. He looks around

Phi:We’re aday late this

 but the Saints won the
           Superbowl.        

laments to himself, “Only three
more weeks of rush.” He then
spends the rest of the morning
devising a plan to get girls drunk
at his house before they head
over to Phi Delt.

Phi Delt — The Phi Delt was
already tempted to wake up
around seven in the morning
when he told his sleeping “bed-
mate” to leave within ﬁve min-
utes or else. However, he wanted
to sleep in a little longerjust to
bask in the glory ofhis own pres-
ence.

When he ﬁnally does wake
up, the ﬁrst place he heads is
the bathroom. He turns on the
shower, and while waiting for it
to warm up, he catches himself
in the mirror and gets lost for a
while.

After three or four layers of
Aussie conditioner, he starts to
dry off before catching himself
in the mirror. He picks up his

$65 hair brush and is about to
start brushing before remember-
ing that his hair is perfect and
doesn’t need to be touched. He
then starts to shave, but only just
enough to make sure that ﬁve-
7o’clock shadow is still intact
once he’s done.

After yet another mirror ses-
sion, he goes downstairs to play
some “Call of Duty” on PS3.
However, once he gets there he
wonders out loud, “Where the
hell is my controller?”

Fiji — I’m sorry, I couldn’t
book a ﬂight to the South Paciﬁc
on such short notice. Maybe next
year...

Phi Psi — A sharp intestinal
pain wakes up the Phi Psi, and he
heads to the bathroom complain-
ing how that day’s ﬂag football
game is now ruined simply be-
cause he was hungry.

After getting ready for the
day, he heads downstairs to hang
out with the rest of his motley
crew of a fraternity. Although he
is from Pennsylvania, he and his
fraternity turn on NESN to see
the “Sawx,” the team that he and
the rest of his pledge class has
identiﬁed with since birth.

He plans on spending the en-
suing time after the Sawx game
preparing the entrance to Fallout
to make sure that each and every-
one can get in.

Phi Kap - Like Brandtford
Winstonworth, the typical Phi
Kap doesn’t technically wake up
alone. He has the beautiful War-
rior Noz Head and shaft to keep
him company.

He strokes his lettuce and
bros out in bed for a while be-
fore properly greeting the day.
He dons some dank gear that he
bought at the Darien Sport Shop.
The pastels will impress the la-
dies for sure.

Even though it’s the weekend,
the true Phi Kap never lays off
his work life. Bros aren’t about

 
 
 
   
  
     
     
   
 
     

hanging out; they are about mak-
ing bank. Today, he will make his
bank the proper way by walking
downstairs and picking up his
check from Benny.

Later, he makes sure to re-
send in his application to Gold-
man Sachs since the last four
must have gotten lost in the mail.
Now that he’s done making pres-
ent and ﬁiture bank, he lounges
around the house waiting for the
girls to inevitably come.

Chi Psi — The typical Chi
Psi hits the ﬂoor rolling out of
bed. Last night was pretty over-
whelming. His arms are very
sore after playing hours and
hours of Donkey Kong on the
pipes the night before. Oh well,
at least the swim team appreci-
ated this version of“Chi Psi
Late Nite.”

Today is a busy day, so he
gets ready quickly. He austerely
pats his unkempt hair, trying
to somehow get it presentable
enough to have the United
States government approve of it.

He will now spend the entire
day driving up to Washington,
D.C., and trying as best as he
can to convince US Customs
officials that they should not
deport the 2009-2010 Chi Psi
pledge class. Why were they so
lazy with those green cards?

Generals struggle after sloppy performance

Turnovers plagued the women is basketball team all week, but W&L still pulled out two victories over-Randolph and Lynchburg

Bylstephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

The Generals came into this past
week playing some of their best bas-
ketball of the season. Stiﬁing defense,
MVP-esque performances from sopho-
more forward Becca Bolton, and an of-
fensive attack that was ﬁnally clicking

road. We have not been shooting well,
but we battled back to make it a very
close game. Randolph is a scrappy
team, but we held out and ﬁnished it to
the last possession.”

W&L traveled to VWC last Tuesday

“Our last two games were not our best, and we did not

play at our usual level. But we have been working hard

in practice and we are planning on winning the rest of

our games this season. ” Becca Bolton, forward

 

provided the recipe for victory in seven
of their last eight games. But Washing-
ton and Lee (10-8, 9-5) cooled off con-
siderably during their last two contests
falling to Virginia Wesleyan 60-58 and
narrowly beating Randolph College 53-
51.

“This last week was pretty tough for
us,” said junior forward Felice Herman.
“With long hours and a weird schedule,
it has really challenged us during our
games. Virginia Wesleyan is always
a tough game for us, especially on the

looking to continue its four-game win-
ning streak, but the Generals couldn’t
ﬁnd their stride until the second half.
They trailed 32-24 at the intermission,
but came roaring out of the locker-room
on an 11-0 run to brieﬂy take the lead.
Free throws from Bolton and buckets
from Herman, junior guard Allie Long’
and sophomore guard Meg Ingram
helped the Generals take a 35-32 lead
with a little over 15 minutes to go. But
sloppy play on the part of the Generals
allowed the Marlins to battle right back.

The Generals turned the ball over 20
times in the contest, including a couple
costly mistakes that handed VWC ﬁve
straight points and the lead with two
minutes left. The Generals shot close to
60 percent in the second half, but their
shots weren’t enough to make up for
their turnovers.

Herman and Bolton both tallied 14

points in the game and recorded seven -

and nine rebounds, respectively. Ingram
added 12 points, four assists and three
steals.

Two days later, the team boarded the
bus to Randolph College. The Generals
walked away with a close 53-51 win, but
in the Generals’ eyes the margin should
have been a lot wider.

Randolph has been struggling all
year, sporting only a 3-17 overall re-
cord with a 2-14 mark in conference
play. But the Generals found themselves
down 47-41 with 9:18 to go in the game.
First-year guard Katy Wilson saved
the momentum and the victory for the
Generals. Wilson slashed to the basket
for a lay-up and then stole the ball from
Randolph’s Megan Carney on the next
possession, ﬁnding Ingram down low
for another easy two points.

Just like that, a-quick four points pro-

vided the spark for a 12-4 run to end the
game and give the win to W&L. Ingram

‘scored the last ﬁve points for the Gener-

als and her jumper with 3:15 to go put
the game away. Only one more basket
was scored the rest of the game.

Ingram led the way with a season-
high 21 points. Her game revolves
around the three-point shot and she was
4-8 from downtown against Randolph.
Bolton was held to single-digit scoring
for only the second time this year with
ﬁve points, but she made up for it with
15 rebounds and four steals. Herman
chipped in a solid 11 points and seven
boards.

The sloppy performance in this
week’s game was unexpected and disap-
pointing for the Generals.

“Our last two games were not our
best, and we did not play at our usual
level,” Bolton said. “But we have been
working hard in practice and we are
planning on winning the rest of our
games for this season.”

Herman was also conﬁdent about her
team’s ability to rebound from its slug-
gish play heading into a series of home
games.

“It will be nice to play at home and
we just need to play as one on defense

and offense,” she said. “If we do what
we do best, we will be ﬁne.”

The Generals were set to take on
Lynchburg College this past Friday, but
the game was rescheduled for Sunday
after a winter storm covered campus in a
blanket of snow.

A few extra days of practice might
have been just what the Generals need-
ed. The team rebounded from its slug-
gish play earlier in the week to defeat
Lynchburg 72-68.

The’ Generals committed 19 tum-
overs in the victory, but strong shooting
performances saved the game.

Ingram led the Generals with 17
points and Bolton put up yet another
double-double with 16 points and 10
rebounds.

Sophomore forward Kari Pfannen-
stein added 15 points and Long rounded
out the top scorers for the Generals, put-
ting up 13 points in the victory.

The Generals will keep a home-court
advantage this week, starting with a
match—up against Emory & Henry to-
night. Tip-offis at 7 p.m.

Super Bowl XLIV: All about the timing

Everything fell into place for the New Orleans Saints as they stunned the Indianapolis Colts 31-] 7 in Miami on Sunday

By Adam Cancryn
STAFF WRITER

As it so often is in life, timing was
everything.

The Miami Dolphins were just two
months removed from their 2005-06
campaign, one that was considered a gi-
ant step forward for the franchise. The
team had ﬁnished 9-7, a far cry from
their 4-12 record just a year earlier. Mi-
ami had even capped their turnaround
with a rousing two-point victory over
the New England Patriots in week 17.

The Dolphins’ mastermind was ﬁrst-
year coach Nick Saban. Pried from the
college ranks after ﬁve years at LSU,
Saban was the hottest commodity in
football. And in his ﬁrst year, he had not
disappointed. Spirits were high, and the
pieces seemed in place for a playoff run
in the near future. All Miami needed to
complete its transformation was a quar-
terback.

Luckily, there was not one, but two
all-pro QBs available. The Minnesota
Vikings were shopping the troubled but
immensely talented Daunte Culpepper,
while San Diego Chargers QB Drew
Brees hadpelected to test free agency.
Each had their eyes on Miami.

Saban met with both, and decided
to trade for Culpepper. Brees had the

track record and the desire to be a D01-
phin, but his injury history scared them
off. After having rotator cuff surgery in
the offseason, there were doubts that he

could return to his previou'§ form.

Saban and the Dolphins acquired
Daunte Culpepper on March 14. That
same day, Brees accepted a 6-year,
$60 million deal with the New Orleans
Saints, a franchise whose relocation
rumors made more headlines than the
actual games. For Brees and his Miami
dream job, the timing just wasn’t right.

But sometimes, things just seem to
fall into place. I

The Saints came out of halftime in
Sunday night’s Super Bowl down 10-6.
They had dominated possession in the
second quarter, but had just two ﬁeld
goals to show for it. Now, Peyton Man-
ning and the Indianapolis Colts’ offense
was ready to take the ﬁeld and take back
control.

But instead of conceding the kickoff,
kicker Thomas Morstead booted a low
liner toward the Colts’ front line. The
onside kick caught the Colts off-guard,
and in the ensuing scramble the ball
skittered off the turf and into the hands
of the Saints’ Chris Reis. As abruptly as

possession had changed, so had the mo-
mentum.

Sometimes, good timing is a result of
countless hours of and preparation.

Shortly after signing Brees, the Saints
drafted running back Reggie Bush and
receivers Marques Colston and Devery
Henderson. They vaulted into starting
spots as rookies, developing a rapport
with their quarterback that four years
later enabled Brees to complete 32 of
his 39 pass attempts on Sunday. Relying
on precisely run routes and an unspoken
chemistry, the experienced trio caught
19 of them.

Sometimes, good timing means a
second chance.

Kicker Garrett Hartley caught on
with the Saints in 2008. An undrafted
free agent who had already been cut
once in his short career, he signed with
New Orleans in October and promptly
nailed his ﬁrst 13 ﬁeld goals. Hartley
had a stranglehold on his ﬁrst NFLjob,
until he tested positive for the banned
stimulant Adderall prior to the ‘O9 sea-
son. A four-game suspension relegated
him to the bench, where he sat until an
injury to the starting kicker gave him
a second shot. Hartley responded with

four ﬁeld goals against Washington, in-
cluding an overtime game-winner that
preserved the Saints’ then-perfect sea-
son. Nine weeks later he converted his
third attempt from over 40 yards, setting

the route, secured the ball and took it
on a 74-yard, game clinching, end zone
jaunt.

Four years ago, the Saints’ franchise
history consisted only of wasted oppor-

a new Super Bowl record and bringing
the Saints within one at 17-16.

And so it is no surprise that the play
that sealed the Saints’ Super Bowl win
came on a timing play, one the Colts
had run successfully hundreds of times
before.

Receiver Reggie Wayne darted off
the line, stutter stepped and turned to his
right, anticipating that familiar Manning
spiral. But New Orleans comerback Tra-
cy Porter anticipated it too. He jumped

tunities and squandered talent. But since
then, everything has fallen into place,
culminating with Super Bowl MVP
Drew Brees hoisting the Lombardi Tro-
phy high overhead. Standing midﬁeld,
clad in black and gold as confetti fell
from the Miami sky, his timing could
not be better.

Insidelook with Becca Bolton

The sophomore forward has put up huge numbers for the Generals this season, including seven double-doubles in her last nine games

By Wit Robertson
STAFF WRITER

Becca Bolton’s shooting skills
and team leadership have helped the
Washington and Lee women’s basket-
ball team win 11 games, including 10
ODAC victories, so far this season. The
5’9” guard and forward is averaging 16
points and 11.2 rebounds per game, with
42 assists and 24 steals only 19 games
into the season. She has scored double
digits in every game except for two and
has put up a double-double in seven of
the team’s last nine games. .

As a ﬁrst-year, Bolton started 24
games and produced seven double-dou-
bles with 16 double-digit scoring efforts.
She also averaged 12.4 points per game,
7.7 rebounds per game and accrued 48
steals on the season. She shot 75.6 per-
cent from the foul line and 40.9 percent
from the ﬁeld.

While at Chatham Central High
School, Bolton lettered in basketball
and soccer. In her senior year, she was
captain of both sports, and she played
varsity basketball all four years of high
school. Bolton earned Chatham Cen-

tral’s Athlete of the Year award and the
Conference Player of the Year award, as

Reporter Wit Robertson talks to
Bolton about her success on the court:

Off the court at W&L, Bolton is a
Dean’s List student who is majoring in
biology and environmental studies. She
is a member of the Student Environmen-
tal Action League, the “Compost Crew”
and the College Democrats.

PHI: How did you ﬁnd W&L and
what made you decide to come to here?

BOLTON: I wanted to play basket-
ball and applied to Elon, Richmond,
Guilford, Virginia Tech (not for basket-
ball) and W&L. W&L had the best ac'a-
demics and I had an awesome visit. The
school is so pretty and the basketball

program seemed to ﬁt me well.

PHI: How did your high school
basketball experience at Chatham Cen-
tral inﬂuence your decision to play at
W&L?

BOLTON: Chatham is a small 1A
school, but we had a competitive pro-
gram. My senior year we made it to
the semi-ﬁnals of the state tournament.
That experience helped me to know that
I wanted to play basketball as long as I
could

PHI: What has being a part of the
basketball team added to your experi-
ence at W&L? ‘

BOLTON: It means a lot to me. My
teammates are my closest friends and
the team itself is very important to me.
Without basketball, W&L would not be
the same.

PHI: What off-season preparation, or
in-season experience, has made such a

young team united enough to perform so.

well this season? ,
BOLTON: The freshmen came in
well this year and ready to play. The

t

freshmen are getting playing time and
are learning how to play a higher level
of basketball. They are getting more vo-
cal and that is helping our team. Also,
our trip to San Diego brought the team
together greatly.

PHI: What is your most memorable
moment, or game, since playing for the
Generals?

BOLTON: Last year, when the team
was not doing so well, we were playing
at Emory & Henry. Former senior guard
Bethany Ridenhour scored a game-
changing jump-shot to give us the lead
and eventually the victory.

» PHI: What‘ do you think made you so
successful this season? '

BOLTON: I am a year older and more
mature on the court. I don’t worry about
missing shots or making a bad pass and
that has made me more conﬁdent during
the games. If my shot is not falling one
game, I am able to focus on assists and
rebounds, which has helped me and the
team a lot.

Win-streak snapped

The Generals defeated Emory & Henry, but fell to Randolph-Macon

By Hank Nathan
STAFF WRITER

A strong surge in the second halfsurge
gave the Washington and Lee men’s bas-
ketball team their third win in a row against
Emory & Henry College on Wednesday,
but the Generals couldn’t rally to defeat
Ranolph-Macon College last night. The
Generals kept Emory & Henry College
winless in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference with a 77-58 victory over the
Wasps, but fell 56-53 to Randolph-Macon.
The Generals are now 13-7 overall and 5-
6 in ODAC conference play.

One of the major differences during

the three-game streak was winning the

turnover battle, said senior forward Zac‘

White.
“Tumovers have deﬁnitely been the

A key- both committed and forced,” said

White. “We”ve cut our turnovers to about
10 per game, while forcing our opponents
into 17 in each ofthe last three games.”

The Generals forced 17 turnovers-in
the game against E&H and gave away
only 11. But despite the lopsided turnover
margin, the Wasps managed to keep the
game close in the ﬁrst half.

W&L won the opening tip, and senior
forward Ben Goetsch immediately capi-
talized with a reverse layup. Goetsch went
on to score the team’s next two points on
another layup. Both teams then went cold
and the score was knotted at 7-7 with near-
ly 13 minutes remaining in the ﬁrst half.

The Generals attempted to break away
from the Wasps after an 11-2 run put the
team up 23-12 with 5:55 to go. But E&H
responded right away with a 15-5 run of
its own to cut the lead to 3. W&L led 28-
25 at the half.

But the second half was a different
story. The Generals overcame their shoot-
ing woes and began to take control ofthe

W&L continued its momentum after
an E&H bucket and went on a 17-4 run,
which included nine points by Adkins to
advance the score to 52-31. The Generals
did not look back, but they maintained a
double-digit lead for the rest of the game.
Some ofthe highlights included an alley-
oop layup by sophomore guard Jon Guest
off ofa feed from Adkins who was behind
the three-point line. Senior forward An-
drew Payne also got into the act by sinking
a left-handed hook shot while drawing the
foul. W&L scored 49 points in the second
half to make the ﬁnal score 77-58.

In the contest, the Generals had four
scorers in double ﬁgures—Goetsch (14),
White (14), Adkins (11) and junior guard
Jason Cimino added in 10. Payne and ﬁrst-
year Hans Harris chipped in by combining
for 17 off of the bench.

“The scoring balance has to do with
being aggressive on offense,” said White.
“People are ﬁnding themselves in posi-
tions that are best for them and seizing op-
portunities more than ever.”

W&L was scheduled to face No. 1-
ranked Guilford College over the weekend,
but the game was postponed to February
15 because of poor weather conditions.

But lingering snow didn’t keep Ran-
dolph-Macon away from the ODAC game
last night.

The last time the Generals played the
Yellow Jackets, they earned their ﬁrst win
in Randolph-Macor1’s gym since the 1958-
1959 season. But the Generals couldn’t
pull off the win on their home court and
Randolph-Ma'con defeated W&L 56-53.

Adkins lead the Generals with 15
points and five rebounds. Goetsch added
13 points and ﬁve rebounds.

In addition to the regional competition last week-
end, the team attended four tournaments during the
fall. They placed third at Richmond University and
second and ﬁfth at Duke, so (leading into regioiials,
team members were very_excited.

“We were conﬁdent that we had built two very
strong, competitive teams,” Budzinski said.

The results show that the team’s excitement was
warranted. They made a last minute change in their
case but it paid off with the ﬁrst and fourth place
ﬁnishes. In addition to the team’s success, freshman
Nate Reisinger received a best witness award for his
portrayal of the murder victim’s nerdy assistant.

The teams will spend the next month preparing
for the Opening Round Championship which will
take place on Mar. 26-28. Although the team obvi-
ously wants to succeed at the next level, Budzinski
says he will be proud of this team no matter what.

“As long as they give it their all, I really don’t
think winning or losing is the most important thing,”
Budzinski said.

Mock trial is a huge time commitment and mem-

bers often have to miss other events on campus.

The next round of competition conﬂicts with Fancy
Dress. But in spite of all the time required, members
really enjoy the experience.

“We have a lot of fun together, so it is deﬁnitely
worth missing some things,” ﬁrst year team member
Abbie Caudill said.

Caudill’s favorite part of being on the team is get-
ting to spend time with such a great group of people.
The friendships formed between team members are
also important to Budzinski.

“It’s really a great program- it brings together a
bunch of very smart, talented people who might not
otherwise socialize,” says Budzinski. “Every year,
we grow closer and support each other to the end, no
matter what. It’s really great.”

executive director, Thomas G. Goo-

The move back to Lexington will
be a permanent one rather than the
temporary locations ODK has used
in the past.

“We spent many years at the
University of Kentucky and the last
few years at Transylvania Univer-
sity. This move will give us our ﬁrst

In its mission statement, ODK
strongly emphasizes three key goals.
The first is to recognize those who

Large possibilities loom on the horizon for microfinance

Both at Washington and Lee and abroad, microﬁnance is developing into a feasible way of helping the third world

By Jarrett Brotzman
COLU M NIST

Around the world, billions of
people live in extreme poverty,
with approximately one in ﬁve
individuals living on less than

$l.25aday.
On an international scale,
large-scale poverty reduction

campaigns have yielded mixed
results. Since 2006, when Mu-
hammad Yunus received the
Nobel prize for his work with
the Grameen Bank and micro-
loan program, new attention has
been called to the emerging ﬁeld
of microﬁnance as a sustainable
and holistic approach to poverty
alleviation and reduction around
the world.

Microﬁnance, also called mi-
crolending or microloans, serves
to provide basic credit services
for impoverished entrepreneurs
around the globe. Concentrated
in developing or third world na-
tions, Micro Finance Institutions
(MFIS) serve to ﬁll the credit gap
to impoverished entrepreneurs.

Most of these loans are quite
small, ranging from $25 USD
to $150 USD, and used by indi-
viduals to purchase basic capital
equipment, expand their busi-
nesses, hire more workers and
provide clean water and electric-
ity to their families and commu-
nities.

Theory and practice have re-
vealed microﬁnance to be an ef-
fective method for engendering

erty alleviation. Underdeveloped
countries around the world are

injections that ﬁnance entrepre-
neurs who do not otherwise have

alleviation, these loans are also
considered a very sustainable
form of aid as most proﬁts from
loan prepayments are recycled
through the communities where
the loans were originally made.
Since the root causes of ex-
treme poverty go deeper than

their environment and how to do
business in a way that beneﬁts
their families, their communities
and the welfare of their entire
country.

these impoverished communi-.
ties that microﬁnance provides,

access to ﬁnancial capital.

As lack ofcredit and capital is
an evident problem for the poor,
access to capital through micro-
ﬁnance will give individuals the
opportunity to raise themselves
from poverty and develop sus-
tainable businesses that beneﬁt
the greater economy.

Repayment rates are quite
high for these microloans, rang-
ing from 90-99% non-delinquent
repayments for the vast majority

lack of capital; the poor must
have access to practical informa-
tion and skills in order to suc-
ceed.

Furthermore, poor health and
unexpected deaths from AIDS
and childbirth create loan de-
linquencies that undemiine the
microﬁnance model. This is why
most microﬁnance institutions

have programs to teach borrow- ’

ers how to protect themselves
from HIV/AIDS, how to protect

opportunities to institutional and
individual investors.

Deutsche Bank has estimated
that there is over a $250 billion
USD gap in micro ﬁnancing
available around the world, and
with only 13 million people be-
ing served by these loans, there
is an estimated 500 million more
potential customers to be served
(Source: Deutsche Bank, World
Vision).

A group of W&L students

have seen this ﬁnancing gap as
an opportunity to make an im-
pact on poverty around the world
and gain experience building,
running, and managing a multi-
faceted microﬁnance investment
group. Called the General De-
velopment Initiative, Inc. (GDI),
the group is initially focused
on making microloans to high
quality MFI’s around the world
through a group called Dvelo.
org.

Dvelo, cofounded by Wash-
ington and Lee alum Drew Mc-
Way, seeks to help fund MFI’s
while returning a portion of the
interest rate of the loan to inves-
tors. With a motto of “Do Well.
Do Good”, Dvelo is opening up-
the once-closed nature of micro-
ﬁnance.

The GDI seeks to also expand
the opportunities for students at
W&L inside and outside the
classroom. With the goal of a
new spring term class studying
the intricacies on microﬁnance
through on-the-ground ﬁeld-
work, managing a ever—growing
loan portfolio, and network-
ing through other colleges and
MFl’s, the GDI seeks to become
the premier college-afﬁliated
microﬁnance initiative.

The potential for microﬁ-

nance is large and ever growing.
Not only have these small loans
been shown to increase the qual-
ity of life and access to basic
credit services to impoverished
individuals around the world,
but microﬁnance is quickly be-
coming a new form of invest-
ment where individual investors
can both earn a quality ﬁnancial
and social retum.

To learn more about these
possibilities, get involved with
the General Development Ini-
tiative here at Washington and
Lee.

Jon Salm explains the absurdity of hype that surrounds Girl Talk, who played at the Pavilion last Friday night

By Jonathan Salm
COLU M N I ST

If you attended the same con-
cert as I did Friday night, you
probably had a great time danc-
ing and grooving to the deriva-
tive pop mash-ups of Girl Talk
(real name: Greg Gillis).

I had a great time, too. I’ve
been a fan of Girl Talk’s for
years, and Gillis’ mash-ups pro-
vide a near perfect soundtrack for
the current generation of teenag-
ers and young adults: a culture

' of easily distracted, Adderall de-

pendent pop culture addicts.

By seamlessly combining
tracks like The Notorious B.I.G"s
“Juicy" with Elton John’s “Tiny
Dancer” into brutally catchy
dance music, Girl Talk has
quickly become a pop culture
phenomenon.

Gillis created Girl Talk with
two albums of glitch-pop mash-
ups as a bored college student in
his Case Western Reserve dorm
room. .

After years of practice, Gillis’
two most recent albums are full
of his characteristically smooth

and danceableimash-ups featur-
ing pop music’s guiltiest plea-
sures.

However, after seeing Gillis
perform live for the ﬁrst time this
weekend, I cannot help but feel
betrayed by this so-called “con-
cert experience.”

Despite putting on an un-
doubtedly entertaining, thrilling
and mind—numbingly loud show,
I couldn’t help but question Gil-
lis’ performance.

It is not that Gillis puts on
an bad show; in fact, it is com-
pletely the contrary: the one
thing Gillis seems to succeed at
is having a good time and mak-
ing sure his audience does, too.
Everything else, though, reeks of
a sham, but nothing annoys me
more than Gillis’ claim of ‘‘I’m
Not a DJ.”

Gillis is as much of a per-
former as his music is original
— that is, not at all. lfl grew my
hair out, rocked a beard, put on
a bandanna and sweated my
balls of onstage, I could put on

‘the same sort of show that Gillis
did (I’m a great dancer and hype
man). ,
The technical aspect of speed-
ing up and slowing down tracks
and then aligning vocals with
beats and instrument tracks is an
essentially simple process.

ence is less of a concert and more
of a party.

Loud music, thrashing,
sweaty bodies, and an extremely
intoxicated crowd. The whole
experience could have very well-
been reciprocated on windfall or
at a_ polerhouse.

Despite putting on an undoubtedly

entertaining, thrilling and mind—numb-

ingly loud show, -I couldn ’t help but

question Gillis ’ performance.

As for playing live, Gillis
simply sequences together the
pre-created tracks, often recre-
ating some of the same exact
mash-ups found on his studio
albums.

After Friday, it seemed obvi-
ous that the Girl Talk live experi-

Gillis even invited the crowd
to the stage to party with him
(the lackluster performance and
energy of those students is an-
other story altogether).

I have ample knowledge and
experience of both concerts and
parties, and Gillis’ performance

was unquestionably more similar
to the latter. And atIsuch parties,
who decides which hot tracks to
play? That’s right, the DJ.

Upon examining‘ the DJ vs.
not a DJ argument, Gillis does
deserve some credit.

On one level, Gillis is right
— he is not in fact a DJ. He is as
much ofa DJ during his shows as
I am writing this essay. We both
use a computer to do our work,
although he seems to get, much
more excited about his.

As opposed to Gillis’ com-
puter-only performances, other
modern DJ’s use turntables,
synthesizers, mixers, drum ma-
chines, as well as computers. By
this logic, Gillis would be right
in asserting he is not a DJ.

On the other hand, I consider
him to be even less than a DJ.
Now thisjust seems cruel, reduc-
ing a critically acclaimed artist
(I use this term liberally) to the
level of a frat party DJ.

Gillis doesn’t deserve that.
His mash-ups are exciting dance

tracks, and there’s a reason he
gets paid inordinate amounts
of money to press buttons and
dance around in front of college
students. Under those param-
eters, there is absolutely no de-
nying that he is great at what he
does.

Therefore, there is no way
around it: Girl Talk IS A DJ.

states are ravaged by a series of
snowstorms that simply will not
cease, W&L gleefully ignores
the multiple feet of snow and po-
tentially lethal sheets of ice and
demands that its faculty, students
and other employees continue to
carry on with classes and other
activities.

Friday, Feb. 5, was the most
egregious example of this irre-
sponsibility. On Thursday night,
universities and high schools
for miles around shut down in
recognition of and preparation
for the snowstorm which had a
100 percent chance of occurring,
according to accuweathercom
(or any other reputable weather
website).

Not W&L. Oh, no, the ad-
ministration decided to wait
until after 8:30 a.m. to declare
that classes after noon would be
canceled.

Small matter that the snow

continued to fall that day well
into the aftemoon and early eve-
ning.

Small matter that students
still had to travel to campus to
attend an ll:l5 class that they
dared not miss because a quiz
was scheduled.

There are only three possible
explanations for such foolish be-
havior: 1) the administration has
access to neither the Internet nor
basic television and so had no
idea of what was going on out-
side of their realm of existence,
2) the administration did have

access to these things and decid- '

ed that either every single weath-
er prediction was wrong or that
the snow and ice would not, in
fact, render roads and sidewalks
dangerous, or 3) the administra-
tion simply does not care about
the safety of its faculty, students
and other employees.

Lest the administration should
miss my point, let me state it very
clearly here: being the only insti-

tution (save for VMI) for miles
around to remain open in the
face of a 100 percent chance of
snow and ice is not something to
celebrate. “Look at us and how
brave we are” is not the appro-
priate sentiment. When even the
post ofﬁce is closed, it’s time to
close the doors for a day, W&L.

satisfy some requirement.

Don’t worry, I’ll get over it.
I’m just curious — and I think

of the above four theories might
help the entire faculty under-

stand what level of engagement
we can expect from students this

Learning to live and love the ‘B+’ lifestyle in college

Stockton Bullitt provides a happy, stress—free alternative to constantly killing yourself over getting that “A ”

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

When “A” students respond
to this article, they will inevita-
bly say, “You’re just jealous of

‘what you can’t have.” And you

know what, they’re partially
right. Without reading this ar-
ticle, I can safely say you have
already won.

Are they gone yet? Good.

Okay, while the “A” students
do serve to help the school look
better to outsiders, the rest of us
all know that we really aren’t too
jealous of them.

This irrational dislike for “A”
students stems from the fact that
there are two kinds of “A” stu-
dents: the blessed few who ﬁnd
success in anything they touch
and the unhappy majority ob-
sessed with success to the point
that they are willing to sacriﬁce
their happiness in favor of a
higher GPA.

No matter what the rest of
us do, we will never be like the
blessed few and most of us just
cannot seem to bring ourselves
to emulate the tiresome work
ethic of the unhappy majority of
“A” students.

So, how do the rest of us cope
with not ﬁnding the consistent
66A???

Do we spend all our days
copying those who have found
success‘?

Do we say screw it, buy a
Volkswagen van and give up on
life?

Well, let me introduce you
to the epiphany that is the “B+”
lifestyle.

Before I do however, 1 just
want to make clear; I am not
necessarily talking about grades
when I talk about “A” students
and the “B+” lifestyle.

You can basically attribute
grades to all facets of life. While
I am certainly not an “A” student
with respect to grades, I deﬁnite-
ly am when it comes to writing
insulting things about fratemi-
ties. I am B- dresser, B partier
and C- video gamer (I always
dual-wielded the machine guns
in “Halo” instead of sticking with
the Battle Riﬂe). It doesn’t really
matter to what facet of your life
you attribute this article because
it applies to all of them.

Anyways, the “B+” lifestyle
is a certain way of living that
stresses being good at some-
thing, but not too good at it.

The theory originated that
when I was in elementary and
middle school. “B+” was the ex-
act grade that 1 could get on a test
or paper that satisﬁed both of my
personal necessities: I didn’t have
to spend too much time working
for it and it was just good enough

to not let my parents give me the
disappointed look.

See, nobody can really blame
you for getting a “B+” on any-
thing because it says that you
could’ve done a lot worse and
evidently you simply just aren’t

is where my issue with “A” stu-
dents comes in.

When I was in 7th grade, I
ﬁnally made the “A” team in
CYO basketball. I killed myself
the summer before getting good
at basketball, just so I could be a

talented enough to do better.

Like a “B,” it’s in the medi-
um, but unlike a “B,” it has that
extra plus to make it a happy me-
dium.

Malcolm Gladwell, a writer
for the New Yorker, asserted that
you need 10,000 hours of prac-
tice to become truly masterful at
it. While that is true, unless you
are one of the gifted minority, I
counter that whatever you’re do-
ing most likely stops being fun
around hour 3,000 or so.

Furthermore, I would much
rather do 100 things for 100
hours, rather than stick with
that one thing for 10,000. This

Why LeBron James is the

king of basketball

Using a myriad of statistics and references, Zac Burke
analyzes why LeBron James is the best player in the NBA

_ By Zac Burke

COLUMNIST

There has been a long debate
about who is the best basketball
player in the world. For all in-
tensive purposes, the debate has
been restricted to two players-
LeBron James and Kobe Bryant.

I am writing this article to tell
you one thing: LeBron James is
the best player in the NBA and
there is no close second.

Let me start off by telling you
that if you do not enjoy watching
and following sports, you will
not enjoy this article. It is full of

use when saying that Kobe is
better than LeBron is that Kobe
has four rings to LeBron’s zero.
While this is true and is a valid
point, Kobe’s rings rarely oc-
curred because of him alone.

He won three straight from
2000-2002 and all three times
Shaquille O’Neal was the ﬁ-
nals MVP. Shaq now plays
with LeBron on the Cavaliers,
but instead of the 28.5 ppg and
12.4 rebounds Shaq averaged
from 1999-2002, Shaq now aver-

What all these statistics tell you is that

LeBron can carry his team essentially by

himself while Kobe needs other all—stars

around him to dominate. Kobe can be a

dominant scorer, but when he is the main

option, his team is simply not as good.‘

statistics and basketball speciﬁc
references.

With that disclaimer, I begin
my argument. LeBron is ﬁrst in
the NBA in points, sixth in as-
sists, l4th in assists and is top 40
in blocks and rebounds. In short,
he does everything a basketball
player is asked to do extremely
well.

His team, the Cleveland Cav-
aliers, have the best record in the
NBA with a starting lineup that is
laughable compared to other top
teams in the league.

Kobe Bryant, on the other
hand, has Pau Gasol, one of the
most talented big men in the
NBA; Andrew Bynum, widely
considered one of the best cen-
ters in the league; Ron Artest, a
four time member of the NBA’s
all defensive team and Lamar
Odom, one of the best sixth men
in the league.

LeBron averages more points,
rebounds, assists, blocks, steals,
shoots a higher percentage and
has led his team to a better re-
cord in roughly the same amount
of minutes (38.9 to 38.6) than
Kobe.

The main argument people

ages only 11.7 points and 6.9 re-
bounds per game. Clearly LeB-
ron is not dealing with the same
‘-‘Big Diesel” as Kobe was in the
early 2000’s.

LeBron won the MVP over
Kobe in the 2008-2009 season,
averaging 28.4 points, 7.2 as-
sists and 7.6 rebounds per game
and ranked among the top seven
small forwards in 12 of the 16
categories used in most statisti-
cal analysis. He has also trans-
formed the Cavaliers from one of
the perennial worst teams in the
league to the team with the best
average record in the NBA over
the past three years.

Many supporters of Kobe
Bryant say that they would take
Kobe over LeBron if they needed
a player to make one shot for the
win.

While it may seem that
Kobe always makes the shots in
crunch time, when one looks at
the “clutch stats” it appears that
LeBron is superior to Kobe. Ac-
cording to 82games.com LeBron
hit the most ﬁeld goals in the last
24 seconds of regulation to tie
or win a game of any player in
the NBA. Kobe hit only three

less shots than LeBron, but shot
a paltry 25% compared to LeB-
ron’s 34% on game winners.

In “crunch time” LeBron also
had six assists to Kobe’s one, 14
free throws to Kobe’s 12 and four
turnovers to Kobe’s ﬁve.

There is essentially no statistic
that can be used to describe Kobe
as a better basketball player this
season than LeBron. An ESPN
columnist named John Hollinger
uses a statistic called Player Ef-
ﬁciency Rating, or PER, to rank
basketball players using FG%,
FT% points, rebounds and assists
per 40 minutes, turnovers, usage
rate and rebounding rate all com-
bined into a single number.

LeBron’s player efﬁciency
rating last season was a 31.76,
the third best ever and the best
of any player not named Michael
Jordan. This season, LeBron’s
PER is a 31.64 which is the
fourth best PER posted all time.
Kobe is currently posting a lowly
23.14 and his best PER ever was
a 28.11 that he posted in 2005-
2006 when the Lakers lost in the
ﬁrst round of the playoffs.

What all these statistics tell
you is that LeBron can carry his
team essentially by himselfwhile
Kobe needs other all-stars around
him to dominate. Kobe can be a
dominant scorer, but when he is
the main option, his team is sim-
ply not as good. -

Without LeBron the Cavaliers
would likely have a lottery pick
in next year’s draft while Kobe’s
Lakers would be a middle of the
road team in the Western Confer-
ence.

LeBron carries his team in
a multitude of ways while Kobe
acts as the best player on a great
team.

If they both retired today,
Kobe would leave with a better
legacy, but right now LeBron
James could likely carry any
team deep into the NBA playoffs
and will only get better as his ca-
reer progresses, which is why he
is the best player in the NBA and
likely will be for years to come.

part of the “A” team. But when I
did, I found that I didn’t get any
playing time and I didn’t really
even know that many people on
the team. I was miserable and
couldn’t wait until I was back on
the “B” team, where I could get
quality playing time and once
again be the big ﬁsh in a small
pond. This was the ﬁrst time I
found out that the “B+” lifestyle
was much better than the “A-”
lifestyle.

Does this make me a slacker
and kind of a sissy? Yeah, but
that doesn’t stop the fact that
I had a much better time being
both a slacker and a sissy.

I found

A If you haven’t scoffed at this
thesis yet, there are two icons of
the “B+” lifestyle that you can
work on emulating: Gucci Mane
and Nate Robinson.

Atlanta based rapper Gucci
Mane hardly puts any effort into
his rhymes. He does not use Nas’
description, Cam’ron double en-
tendres, or Drake’s one liners.
Instead, he just chooses good
beats and talks about what he
likes (drugs, women and any-
thing yellow).

That being said, he has still
incredible success de-
spite jail time and has probably
the best song of the moment in
“Lemonade.” Gucci Mane’s

focus on enjoying the moment_

rather than putting in effort has
led him to personal success. ‘

New York Knicks point guard
Nate Robinson puts the same
kind of effort in developing his
basketball game as Gucci Mane
puts into his lyrics.

Robinson is notorious for
lackadaisically running around
Madison Square Garden looking
for his. Furthermore, he used
absolutely no imagination in his
defense of his Slam Dunk title
this past weekend. He was able
to win because everyone else in
the ﬁeld was so dreadfully atro-
cious at dunking that Zac White

seriously considered ﬂying down
to Dallas and showing the NBA
how to throw down.

However, despite his porous
effort, Nate the Great used his

talent to be just good enough to _

win yet another Slam Dunk title.
He knew that giving a “A” effort
would’ve been nice, but he had a
lot more fun taking the easy road
to success.

So what am I trying to tell
you in this article? I am not tell-
ing you to give a half-ass eﬁ"ort
at life.

But what I am saying is that
you should focus on the smaller,
more achievable successes in life
and go for those.

It’s not worth it to waste all of
your time worrying about what
the “A” students are doing with
their lives because they either
are predisposed to beating you
or they are simply going to care
about the goal a little more than
you do.

Instead, settle for just being
“good enough” and enjoy the
day. Well, once the snow melts
that is.

East Asian food, fashion and fans  

Students ring in the Lunar New Year with performances, fashion show and an array of food in the Commons I ‘.

By Findley Merritt
STAFF WRITER

For many, the Red House
is often forgotten on the front
comer of Washington and Lee’s
campus.

But this past week, the Lunar
New Year Celebration brought
the department of East Asian
languages and literature to the
forefront.

The department, in tandem
with the Pan-Asian Association
for Cultural Exchange (PAACE),
sponsored two events to celebrate
the Chinese New Year of the
Tiger.

The Marketplace cooked up
a Lunar New Year dinner on
Wednesday.

Red paper lanterns, table cloths
and paper dragons adorned the
dining hall while students were
greeted by two blow-up Chinese
soldiers at the entrance.

For dinner, the dining staff
served shrimp, rice, stir fry, sweet
and sour chicken and green tea ice
cream for dessert.

There was even a sushi station
with California rolls.

Then on Thursday, students
of East Asian languages and
members of PAACE and the
Student Association for Intema-
tional Learning (SAIL) put on a
performance in the Commons to
celebrate the New Year.

The performance pieces ranged
from Chinese and Japanese poetry
recitations to karaoke and a mar-
tial arts performance.

Senior Sophie Xiong and

junior Kara Karcher performed a
traditional Chinese danc,e com-
plete with fans, in front a slide
show about the third-year Chinese
language students’ adventures in
China.

The performance ended with a
PAACE fashion show showcasing
different styles from Burma, Chi-
na, Korea, Japan and Vietnam.

In the fashion show, female
Chinese language students wore
Qipaos, which they explained
were traditional dresses worn to
parties or formal gatherings in
China.

Viewers ate Chinese food at
the conclusion of the performance
while they reflected on the chang-
ing year.

I The Chinese Lunar New Year
falls on a different date each
year and goes through a cycle of
animals that pertain to a speciﬁc
year. It fell on Valentine’s Day
this year.

Professor Hongchu Fu, chair
of the East Asian languages and
literature department, explained
that the tiger symbolizes luck in
Chinese cultures.

He said that Chinese emperors
always associated themselves
with the tiger, and it became a
symbol of reverence and good
fortune. ‘

“Hopefully this lucky year will
drive away the snow,” Fu joked.

Senior Danielle Ausems also
explained more about the Chi-
nese Zodiac in relation to the

Story of love, loss
and geometry

Randi Wilson sums up the German’
departments passionate weekend
performance of “Don Juan ”

By Randi Wilson
s TA F F w R IT E R

They say that 90 percent of
communication is nonverbal.

But I certainly didn’t under-
stand 90 percent of this weekend’s
German play, “Don Juan.” Opting
not to read the English synopsis,
I chose to just watch the play to
see what I could comprehend with
zero German background.

My story went something like
this. There’s a man named Don

Over the next 13 years, Juan
becomes an old-world playboy (in
typical Don Juan fashion), steal-
ing wives and killing their jealous
husbands in self-defense. In the
end, he marries one of the many
women that he has been involved
with, a prostitute enamored with
him, just so he can live in peace
and practice his geometry.

I credit most of what I was able

Juan who loves geometry but
has mixed feelings about women.
He’s involved in a complicated
love triangle, in which one of
the women eventually commits
suicide. He gets in a ﬁght with
another suitor, and after much
sword waving, swiftly kills his

opponent for love. He marries his .

second lover.
I thought it made sense.

After the play concluded, I ﬁ- .

nally read the synopsis to clear up
what I thought were a few minor
issues. What I found was that I
had been close on some points,
and way off on others.

Don Juan is a story of pas-
sion, but not a typical one. He
has found true love in geometry,
a discipline so pure that “eternity
can be envisioned in two parallel
lines.” As a soldier in the Battle
of Cordoba, he performed a he-
roic act, which promised him the
hand of Don Gonzalo’s (a fellow
knight in that battle) daughter
in marriage. The daughter was
the only woman he ever loved,
but she killed herself when he
refused to marry her. Her father
attempted to salvage her honor
in a duel with Don Juan, but he
died after impaling himself on
Don Juan’s sword.

to understand to the fantastic job
the German students did with the
play. There was a great deal of
dialogue, which is impressive to
master in any language, let alone
a second one.

The choice of play, while a
bit different for its fascination
with a math subject, was ﬁlled
with drama and interesting story
turns. I kept wondering what was
going on while the audience, most
of them following along in their
English programs, kept wonder-
ing what would happen next.

But to all potential German
majors, know this: the German
department requires involvement
in this play rather than a senior
thesis. '

Junior Hannah Muther, who
played the part of the prostitute
“Celestina,” is a German and
politics double major. She asks
what’s better, “writing a giant
paper versus dressing up in crazy
costumes?” The choice was clear
for her.

And if a play with geometry
as a central character makes you
uneasily reminiscent of your ninth
grade math class, just remember
that women love an intellectual.

She said that the armual cycle

The order in which they ap-

which they reached Buddha.

ments: earth, metal, wood, water
and ﬁre.

ally with each element once and
creates the 60-year‘ cycle of the

She added that the tiger also
represents passion, so many of
the songs that the students sang
were about love.

Sophomore Chinese language
student Tyler Grant really enjoyed
participating in the program.

He explained that there are few
East Asian language majors, so he
was impressed with the number
of students who came to see the
performance.

Grant said that learning Chi-
nese is extremely difficult, and
students must have the necessary
time to devote to studying the
language.

But because the number of stu-
dents is small, they all feel like a
family headed by Professor Fu,

“Professor Fu is full of love,”
concluded Grant.

dances and poetry, and those who attended could sample East Asian foods.

Four in a row for Generals

The W&L women ’s basketball team improved to 13-8 overall with wins over Emory and Henry and Randolph Macon

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

The momentum just keeps building.
Two more crucial conference games,
two more spectacular blowout wins.
The Washington and Lee women’s bas-
ketball team stretched its winning streak
to four games after knocking off Emory

could insert any number of witty “cold
outside, hot inside the Warner Center”
quips about this one, but to put it simply,
W&L manhandled the Wasps. They did
just about everything right in this game:
they scored, they defended and they

Junior Felice Herman had the unenviable task of

defending Ariail, but she dominated the match-up.

Herman scored 1 6 points, collected 1 0 rebounds, and

and Henry 88-53 and Randolph Macon
73-56 last week.

Last Tuesday, the Gennies (13-8,
12-5 ODAC) welcomed E&H to the
winter wonderland of Lexington. One

gave E&H wonderful directions for the
drive home.

The Generals jumped out to an 8-0
lead and led by 46-18 at the half. That
margin proved insurmountable. W&L

mastered both ends of the court, shoot-
ing 51 percent from the ﬁeld while hold-
ing E&H to only 28 percent shooting.
While the Wasps were busy rattling
their shots off the iron, the Generals had
no problem ﬁnding the net. For the first
time since 1998, six players tallied dou-
ble-digit point totals in a game.

First-year forward Rachel Warrick
led the onslaught with 16 points. First-
year guard Katy Wilson was right be-
hind with 14. Sophomores Kari Ann
Pfannenstein, Meg Ingram, and Becca
Bolton netted 13, 12, and 10 points re-
spectively, while senior center Kaitlyn
Kamp also added 10.

Bolton also collected 11 rebounds
to bring. her double-double total for the
‘season to 11. Bolton’s end-to-end game
seems to be rubbing off on the team, as
Wilson also nabbed 11 boards for her
ﬁrst career collegiate double-double.
Ingram stretched her ODAC-leading
assist average by dropping 8 dimes and

Kamp set a personal season-high seven
rebounds.

ODAC powerhouse RMC came visit-
ing on Saturday. They entered the game
with an impressive 16-6, 14-4 ODAC
record and a legitimate star in 6’ 2” se-
nior center Molly Ariail. She came into
the game leading the conference with a
20.7 point per game average. But it was
W&L who made the statement in this
crushing 73-56 victory.

’ Despite the 42-25 halftime score and
the eventual 17 point margin of victory,
W&L shot just 39 percent in this con-
test. However, superior fundamentals
turned an otherwise lackluster shooting
performance into a basketball clinic. The
Generals outrebounded RMC 51-28, 21
of which were offensive boards. With all
these extra possesions, W&L was able
to ﬁre 61 shots in the game and make the
Yellow Jackets pay for letting them have
second (and sometimes third) chances.

Bolton led all scorers with 21 points

and took down 15 rebounds for yet an-
other double-double. Ingram used an
etﬁcient 6-10 shooting performance to

"net 18 points and ripped the twine on all

four of her three point attempts.

Junior Felice Herman had the un-
enviable task of defending Ariail, but
she dominated the match—up. Herman
scored 16 points, collected 10 rebounds
and hassled Ariail into a 4 of l 1 shooting
performance and a mere 10 points.

With the latest win, W&L set the pro-
gram record for consecutive home wins
with seven. The Generals will be look-
ing for the Warner Center advantage to
continue next week as they close out
their regular season. The Generals travel
to Eastern Mennonite on Tuesday, then
have back to back home games versus
ﬁrst place Roanoke College and Bridge-
water College on Friday and Saturday.
As of right now, W&L has the third
seed for the ODAC conference playoffs
which begin on Feb. 25.

Peyton Manning a choker? Not so fast

The QB has gotten a lot of ﬂack for his Super Bowl performance, but the four—time MVP isn ’t as horrible as the media might have you think

By Adam cancryn
CDLUMNIST

Roughly seven years ago, Peyton‘

Manning was labeled a choker.

He had just ﬁnished throwing four
interceptions in the 2003 AFC Cham-
pionship game, and the whispers of the
past few years had become front-page
headlines. Peyton Manning is a choker.
When it comes time to win the big game,
he collapses. -

If that seems like ages ago, you’re not
alone. Since then, Manning has worked
hard to clear his name. He threw for
49 touchdowns in ‘04, won two more
MVPs and threw for 4,000+ yards ﬁve
times, all while leading the Colts to the
playoffs every single year.

In the midst of all that, Manning
broke through the media-constructed
Super Bowl barrier, winning a world
championship in 2007. He had his ring,
and now, ﬁnally, it was acceptable to
embrace him again as a great quarter-
back. The criticisms turned into praise:
“Bland and uninspiring” became “ruth-
less and efﬁcient,” “over-thinker” be-
came “cerebral.” Where he'once blamed
his teammates, now he just tried to make
them better.

In the weeks leading up to the show-
down with the Saints, debate exploded
over Manning’s ranking amongst the
NFL’s greats. How did he compare to

lie, so selﬁshly tarnish his legacy? Near-

The difference, of course, is wins. And that is the catego-

ry that will hound Manning throughout his career. More

so than in any other sport, wins are precious in football.

 

and, more contemporarily, Tom Brady?

Would a win in Miami establish him as
the greatest of all time?

How silly those disputes seemed as
Tracy Porter trotted into the end zone,
cradling Manning’s last pass of the sea-
son.

With one ill-timed throw, the tide
once again turned against the Colts QB.
He had failed again, had brought his
team to the cusp of greatness only to
lose it all.

He had choked.

And this time, we were going to make
sure no one forgot it. The days following
that fateful interception were ﬁlled with
rancor. How could Manning, given a
second chance by the all-powerful pub-

ly everyone with a pen blasted Manning,
recounting his failures in each of his 18
postseason games. Forget greatest of
all time, Kansas City Star writer and
ESPN contributor Jason Whitlock felt
he shouldn’t even be in the discussion.

“The greatest of all time? Nope. Not
even close now. The G.O.A.T. doesn’t
throw that kind of awful interception.
Joe Montana didn’t throw those in the
Super Bowl,” Whitlock wrote‘. “He’s
now 9-9 in the playoffs, which is about
as far away from G.O.A.T. material as
the Middle East is from the Colts’ prac-
tice facility.”

And so the cycle begins anew. But

wagon ﬁlls up completely, take a deeper

look at his alleged playofffailures. Man-
ning might not be football’s Jordan, but
he also isn’t nearly the disaster that
many would have you believe.
Manning entered the NFL in 1998.
One year later, his team was playoff-
bound at 13-3, the best record since
1968. Over Manning’s next 11 years,
the Colts made the playoffs 10 times.
By comparison, Brady has steered his
team to the postseason six times in
eight full seasons and Kurt Warner just
ﬁve out of 12. Manning even tops Mon-
tana, who made the playoffs just over
70 percent ofthe time.

But getting there has never been the
problem for Manning. He’s owned the
regular season, compiling 32 individual
NFL records and winning three MVPs.
It is his play when it counts that stinks,
critics say. Look at Manning’s stats in
the postseason, however, and there is
little indication he plays at anything but
his best.

In 18 playoff games, just two more
than a regular season, Manning has 28
touchdowns against 19' interceptions.
Additionally, he’s set 11 NFL postsea-
son records, including most 300+ and
400+ yard passing games and biggest
comeback in AFC Championship his-
tory. Compare Manning to Brady, who

is often held as the antonym of choke,
and thetwo are scarily similar. Over the
same number of games, Manning has
more yards and a better completion rat-
ing, while Brady has four fewer inter-
ceptions and a higher quarterback rating
byjust 1.05 points.

The difference, of course, is wins.
And that is the category that will hound
Manning throughout his career. More so
than in any other sport, wins are precious
in football. They are what vaulted a me-
diocre Joe Namath to mythical status
and buried Jim Kelly’s otherwise stellar
career. Manning is 9-9 in the playoffs,
a respectable record, but nothing com-
pared to Brady’s 14-4 or Montana’s 17-
7.

So while Manning might not have
deserved G.O.A.T. consideration, so too
should he be spared from much of the
post-interception vitriol. Sports have
become so heavily scrutinized that, of-
ten times, perspective is lost within the
heap of manufactured debates and hy-
per-analyzed storylines. Manning is not
the greatest quarterback of all time. He
is not the worst choker of all time. He
is simply an excellent quarterback, with
strengths and weaknesses, and half a ca-
reer of hard work left to go.

Two road victories

The Generals defeated Lynchburg and Bridgewater to improve to [5-7 overall

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

The best way to get over a snapped
win-streak is to respond with a new one.
After falling to Randolph—Macon at home
last week, the Washington and Lee Uni-
versity men’s basketball team went back
on the road and returned with two more
ODAC victories. The Generals ousted
Lynchburg College 71-62 on Wednesday
and survived a late game surge to defeat
Bridgewater College 75-71 on Saturday.

The Generals are now 15-7 overall and
7-6 in ODAC conference play.

-LC proved a tough competitor for the
Generals, but 45.3 percent shooting from
the ﬂoor and a strong defensive perfor-
mance gave the Generals the victory and
senior captain forward Zac White a school
record. White tied with Rob Smitherman
for the most blocked shots in a game with
seven. Smitherman posted the record in
1979.

The Generals maintained a comfort-
able lead through most of the ﬁrst half.
W&L shot 50.0 percent from the ﬂoor and
ﬁrst-year guard Hans Harris scored nine
consecutive points for the Generals. But
the Hornets weren’t about to just hand the
W&L a blowout before they even hit the

locker room. Lynchburg seized momen-
tum and responded with an 1 1-4 run to set
the score at 35-29 heading into halftime.
The battle of momentum continued
into the second half. The Hornets came
out shooting, but W&L just kept hitting
theirs shots. Senior captain forward Ben
Goestch cashed in a lay-up, followed by
a 3-pointer from ﬁrst-year Jeremy Adkins
and a tip-in by ﬁrst-year J.D. Ey to expand
the Generals’ lead to 42-33 less than four
minutes into the half. A lay-up by senior
forward Andrew Payne and back-to-back
lay-ups by Goetsch pulled the Generals

ahead by 10, giving them a 48-38 lead
with 13:20 remaining in the game.

But W&L saw its lead squandered as
missed shots and turnovers gave the Hor-
nets a 9-0 run. The Hornets now trailed by
only one point, leveling the score out at
48-47. But that was as close as the Hor-
nets would get. The Lynchburg drive was
a wake-up call for the Generals and the
Hornets never gained the lead. Two foul
shots from White and another tip-in from
Ey moved the Generals ahead 52-47 and
they never looked back.

Foul shots from White and Ey se-

cured the game in the closing minutes and‘ .

W&L won 71-62.

W&L ﬁnished the game with just nine
turnovers. Junior guard Jason Cimino and
Goetsch had 13 points apiece to lead the
Generals. White put up 12 and Harris and
Ey each had nine.

The Generals next faced off against
Bridgewater who had tripped up the Gen- 1
erals 68-64 in thetwo teams’ last meeting
Dec. 2. The Generals had mounted a late
game surge, but it wasn’t enough to hold
off the Eagles. This time around, it was the
Eagles who didn’t have enough.

Bridgewater kept the game close
throughout the ﬁrst half and the Generals
led by only four, at 35-31, heading into
halftime. But that deﬁcit grew to 51-38 af-
ter a 16-7 Generals’ run to open the second
half. Bridgewater never regained the lead
after the halfway mark. The closest they
would come was three points, trailing 69-
66 with a little over a minute left to play.

The Eagles were forced to resort to
fouling, but the strategy didn’t pay off.
W&L drilled six of their last eight free
throws to secure the 75-71 victory.

Ey earned career highs in both points
and rebounds, scoring 14 and posting up
nine boards. Goetsch once again led the
Generals with 18 points and six boards.
Adkins added 14 points and Cimino con-
tributed ﬁve points, six assists, and four
steals.

The Generals now head back to their
home gym for a rescheduled match-up
against No. 1 ranked Guilford. The “Blue

Two ’97 graduates set up

camp and treat patients

By Paige Gance
STAFF WRITER

When a devastating earthquake struck Haiti last
January, Dr. Sacha Montas and Dr. Anthony “Mazz”
Mazzarelli, both of the Washington and Lee class of
1997, knew immediately that they had to go help.
And they did.

Montas and Mazzarelli set up a “de facto refugee
camp” in Jimani, Dominican Republic, adjacent to
the Haitian border, just six days after the 7.0 earth-
quake struck Port-au-Prince. As one of the ﬁrst in-
ternational medical teams to arrive, they were im-
mediately faced with 30 to 50 new patients per day,
most of them severely injured.

Many of the patients had been tumed away from
overcrowded hospitals in Port-au-Prince and sur-
rounding areas. They came however they could, in
trucks or helicopters, to be treated at J imani Public
Hospital by the W&L alums and their team.

Mazzarelli, the medical director of the emergency
medical unit at Cooper Hospital in New Jersey and
the coordinator of the mission, said he was “amazed
by the strength and resiliency of the Haitian people,
even in the face of painful procedures and stories of
suffering and loss.”

Most of the patients had been dealing with their
injuries for days before receiving treatment, and the
shortage of medical supplies made the doctors’ jobs
even more difficult.

Montas said he regularly faced the dilemma of
realizing: “I have this many bandages or I have this
much medication. Can I give it right now to this pa-
tient, or do I have to save it for a patient that needs
it more?”

The team of doctors was able to bring some orga-
nization to the chaos by creating separate areas for
triage, wound care, surgery, medical and post-surgi-
cal care and intensive care.

In a PBS Newshour cover of the mission, Mon-
tas stressed the need for preventing infection and the
danger of operation, since a large number of patients
were amputees.

Montas, who grew up in New York, has Haitian
parents and spent many summers in Haiti with his
aunt and uncle. He can speak Creole, the language
spoken by 80 percent of Haitians.

“I get smiles when they hear someone who can
talk to them,” Montas said in his blog through the
University of Michigan, where he is a fourth-year
resident. He was one of few doctors who could
translate for the hundreds of patients the doctors had
to treat every day.

Montas not only treated his patients’ physical
wounds, but could also listen to their emotional pain
and hopes and fears for the future. So when about
40 patients, many post-operative, were transferred to
Fond Parisien, Haiti, Montas followed them to make
sure the new facilities could care for their complex
needs.

The rehabilitation center in Fond Parisien, which
was run by leaders from the Harvard Humanitarian
Initiative, proved to be a peaceful and organized set-
ting for the recovering patients and the team was
able to continue caring for many of their patients
from the Jimani Hospital.

Mazzarelli and Montas worked together for 12
days treating earthquake victims, but their friend-
ship goes all the way back to their time at W&L.
They were both biology majors, and they worked on
the Inter-Fratemity Council together, holding the top
two positions their senior year.

Most importantly, they both took a bioethics
seminar their senior year that exposed them to the
ﬁeld of health policy.

Their post-graduate honors include law degrees
from the University of Pennsylvania for Mazzarelli
and the University ofMichigan for Montas, and bio-
ethics degrees for both of them at UPenn.

Philadelphia Magazine has also named Mazza-
relli as part of “Next Generation of Great Doctors.”

The tragedy in Haiti has helped keep their jour-
ney from W&L undergrads to accomplished profes-
sionals in perspective.

“We feel thankﬁil for the opportunity to be re-
minded why we entered the field of healthcare,” said
Mazzarelli of his team’s work.

Montas described the nearly two weeks he spent
in Haiti as “the most pure form of taking care of
people I’ve ever experienced.”

Cracking
down on

drugs

 

Lesser-known SJC drug policy could convict students even if they aren ’t using drugs

By Kelsy Mccraw
STAFF WRITER

The Student Judicial Council

- has heard more than 30 drug-related

cases this year, but not all of these
involved drug possession. An over-
sight by the council has left students
responsible for a drug policy that
most didn’t know about.

Students not participating in ille-
gal drugs, even completely sober stu-
dents, have been convicted in cases
involving illegal substances simply
because they were in the same room
as other students who were using
these substances.

Over the past year, the SJC be-
gan holding students accountable for
being in an enclosed room with full
knowledge of illegal activity, such
as drug use, going on in the room.
The law students on the SIC Lise the
legal term “constructive possession”
to help explain the policy in convic-
tions.

However, neither the term not
the policy appears in any student lit-
erature. In an email, Crighton Allen,

chairman ofthe SJC, acknowledged
the problem.

“Due to an oversight in the Stu-
dent Handbook, this policy has not
been clearly laid out to students,” he
said.

Allen assured that the handbook
would be corrected next year.

Nevertheless, the SJC has consis-
tently used this policy all year. And
most students have had no idea that
they had done anything wrong before
their hearings.

The policy upholds the Universi-
ty’s “Zero Tolerance” for illegal sub-
stances. Thus the administration‘s
“crackdown" on drugs goes farther
than users and dealers.

Brandon Dotson. associate dean
of students, said that actively and
passively condoning students in-
volved with illegal drugs perpetuates
these activities. If illegal activities
become the norm in our community,
Robert E. Lee’s standard of gentle-
nian—like behavior is compromised.

According to Allen, this school
year has brought a trend of tolerance
tovvard drug use.

“This year, the SIC has seen an
unprecedented caseload in cases in-
volving illegal drugs,” he said.

Allen could not specify how many
cases ofconstructive possession have
been brought before the SJC. But he
said the SJC has heard 61 total cases
this year, which is 20 more than last
year, and more than half of these 6l
cases were drug-related.

But what should students do if
they find themselves in a compro-
mising situation‘?

Both Dotson and Allen said that
the policy does not require students
to report any illegal activity they
know about. Instead, students should
simply remove themselves from any
situation involving illegal activities,
or they should make their stance
against the behavior apparent.

However, students should not
worry about illegal activities in a

house or at a party. The policy only
applies to a closed room.

The policy calls on students to
quit condoning illegal activities.
While the law would only require
that a person not partake in the ille-
gal activity, this policy asks students
to hold a higher standard of self-gov-
ernance. '

Also, it is important to note that
the SJC and the deans differentiate
between constructive possession and
actual possession. Allen said that the
SJC differentiates the two in terms
of sanctions given to convicted stu-
dents. Similarly, Dotson said that
the difference could be seen on a
student’s behavioral record.

ESOL spends week teaching

Students travel to the Dominican Republic over break and teach at elementary schools

By Lizz Dye
smrr WRITER

English for Speakers of Other
Languages took 17 students for a
one-week experience in the Domini-
can Republic this year. About half
of the students on the trip were se-

niors, all were at least bilingual and
ﬁve were native Spanish speakers.
The three faculty members who ac-
companied them were Ellen Mayock,
professor of Romance languages and
ESOL advisor, Jeff Barnett, Head of
Latin American and Caribbean stud--
ies, as well as Jan Hathorn, W&L
athletic director.

The trip leaders were Natalie

Bunnell, Cailin Slattery and Kelsey
Wright. Mayock said that they “did a
spectacularjob organizing this year’s
trip.” The l7 students taught English
classes at the local elementary school,

(Escuela La Playa, taught intercultur-
al communications to the San Diego
Padres‘ recruits at the complex there,
and worked in a program called “Es-
pacios Para Crecer.”

“Espacios Para Crecer” is a pro-
gram designed for one-on-one read-
ing and homework help for students
during the time they are not in regular
school. Four volunteers also got to

make the trip with the Padres recruits
from Najayo to Santo Domingo to
discuss the recruits’ transition to life
in the U.S.

Mayock said that “ESOL’s over-
arching theme—both here in Rock-
bridge County and in the Dominican
Republic—continues to be literacy
for children and adults. To that end,
student volunteers did a big book
drive to collect Spanish, English and
bilingual books here in Lexington to
bring to the Najayo community. We
are hoping to build an actual library
there in 20ll and to continue with
semi-annual book drive efforts.”

In preparation for the trip, student
volunteers also did fundraising work

here through the Dominican Night at
Sweet Treats Bakery, a pizza night
and T-shirt sales.

In addition, sophomore Chris
Waslmock will be spending spring
term in Najayo as an intern to Pa-
dres employee Veronica Nogueira.
ESOL’s hope for Washnock is to ad-
vance the planning for a library dur-
ing his time there. The organization
hopes to make the Dominican Re-
public internship a regular feature of
the ESOL program, perhaps in con-
junction with Latin American and
Caribbean Studies.

Hillel sends volunteers to Uru

Group puts in time working with children in disadvantaged communities in Montevideo, Uruguay 0

By Kirsten Kyne
snxrr WRITER

Sun, sand and service. For 14
Washington and Lee students,
Washington Break was spent in
Montevideo, Uruguay, surround-
ed by warm weather, beacheand
people in need of their help.
These students spent their break
at a Uruguayan Hillel House
with people their age, working
with children in a shantytown.

“We helped distribute the
food, clean up their daytime nurs-
ery, and play games with them,

and proliferated conversation
about bettering their futures,”
said sophomore Lev Raslin. “We
also visited an abused wives and
children center which we helped
repair and play with the kids.”
Playing with the children was
the best part ofthe trip for many
of the students because they were
able to better their days, even if
it was for just a week. “We were
able to cross the language barri-
ers with them and spend hours
upon hours with them,” said
freshman Ali Greenberg. “It was

good to see the kids able to just
be kids.”

“I actually surprised myself.
I thought I was going to like
the beach and nightlife the best.
The Boys and Girls Club was
the best,” said freshman Melissa
Horadam. “We spent the day at
Punta Del Este [a famous South
American Beach] but, frankly,
I would have gone back to the
Boys and Girls Club. The kids
were really happy to have posi-
tive interaction.”

Raslin and the others were

able to meet and get to know
some of the local people their
age. “There is a strong Jewish
population in Uruguay,” he said.
“We are a minority so to see a
different culture that revolves
around the same roots was fasci-
nating and personally fulﬁlling.”

Aside from spending their
days helping local children and
women, the group was able to
learn more about Uruguayan cul-
ture. “We got to know the city
and shopping culture. Our days
were fully packed with service,

but it night we got to go out with
our peers,” said Greenberg.

“We went to a salsa club and
it was really, really fun to expe-
rience how people in Uruguay
go out,” said Horadam. “They
go out really late and come back
at like 6 in the morning. So I
danced all night to salsa music
with one of my friends from the
Hillel Uruguay.”

“We really bonded with each
other,” said freshman Nora Wal-
lenius.

The hardest part of the trip

was leaving the Boys and Girls
Club for the last time for many
students. “We were leaving...
and a little girl I had been play-
ing with refused to let me go,”
said Greenberg. “She kept saying
‘No, no, no.’”

Raslin said he would return
to Uruguay “in a heartbeat” if
he were given the opportunity
again. Most students agreed.
“If expense weren’t an issue, I
would deﬁnitely go back,” said
Horadam. “I’m never going to
forget this trip.”

Generals Christian Fellowship sends 14 students to volunteer at soup kitchens,

By Chelsea Stevenson
STAFF WRITER

Fourteen members and two
leaders of the Generals Chris-
tian Fellowship (GCF) spent ﬁve
days of their Washington Break
working to help the homeless
and inner city families in Wash-
ington D.C.

The group helped D.C. locals
by working at a soup kitchen
called So Others Might Eat, or
SOME that provides breakfast
and lunch free to the public 365

days a year.

The group’s efforts also went
toward a geriatric day care,
Downtown Cluster, and helped
out with various after school
programs, such as Reaching Ob-
jectives through Joint Action or
ROJA and The Fishing School,
as well as DC Central Kitchen.

At The Fishing School, par-
ticipants helped third and fourth
graders with their homework.
According to junior Eric Ham-
scher, The Fishing School helped
disadvantaged youth in D.C.’s

inner-city schools. Hamscher
called the program, “really awe-
some.”

At Eden’s Center, an area in
D.C. known for its large Viet-
namese-American population,
GCF had the chance to experi-
ence a new culture and partici-
pate in a simulation dedicated to
homelessness.

During the simulation, trip
participants were divided into
groups of three, armed with two
dollars each, and told to ﬁnd a
homeless person throughout the

Trip to Texas

Volunteers work with low-income classrooms

By Chelsea Stevenson
STAFF WRITER

A group of inspired female
students ﬂew to Houston, Texas.
for Washington Break to prepare
low-income Houstonians for
college and to reconnect with
W&L alumni.

On Sunday, Feb. 21 the 14
students ﬂew from Lynchburg,
Va. to Houston and were warmly
greeted by several W&L alumni.
Houston was chosen as the lo-
cation for the Nabors Service
League annual trip four years
ago because of its strong alumni
network.

Senior Samara Francisco, the
general chair of Nabors Service
League, says that a group contin-
ues to return to Houston because
the alumni are so enthusiastic
about hosting W&L students.

The young W&L women
began their eight to nine hour
workdays at YES Prep right
away, upon arrival. YES Prep is
a charter school that provides an
intensive college preparatory ed-
ucation for low-income students
in Houston. According to Na-

bors Service League Staff Ad-
visor, Melissa Caron ’09, YES
Prep has gotten 100 percent of
its economically disadvantaged
students to a university.

The W&L volunteers were
assigned to a variety of the seven
YES Prep campuses, throughout
Houston, where they assisted in
classroom work. While the vol-
unteers’ days lasted eight hours,
an average school day for YES
Prep students lasts nine.

This was the ﬁrst time that
Nabors had sponsored a trip con-
sisting solely of females. Caron
says however that the dynamic of
only women created an inspiring
atmosphere for the volunteers. It
was interesting for the volunteers
to hear from the female alumnae,
who hosted them.

For the six-day trip, the stu-
dents stayed among seven host
homes, six of whom were alum-
ni. The seventh host was an en-
thusiastic W&L parent. After the
eight-hour workday, the volun-
teers spent time at three alumni
dinners and events or enjoyed
dinner with their host family.

Francisco commented that

during the alumni dinners, dis-
cussions were often held with
nonproﬁt organizations and pub-
lic service ﬁgures throughout
Houston, particularly females.

“We met two women who
started their own nonproﬁts. One
was a language immersion pro-
gram to teach Spanish to kids,
and the other organization works
to improve the hydration of the
homeless population in Hous-
ton,” she said.

Throughout their six days in
Houston, the group of 14 female
students made signiﬁcant time
contributions to YES Prep, with
the hopes of sending more eco-
nomically unstable students to
college, and developed strong
relations with W&L Houston
alumni, while learning a lot
about their experiences.

“The alumni are so enthusias-
tic about W&L and love talking
with current students,” Francisco
said.

city to share dinner with.

Hamscher commented that
the exercise exposed the group
directly to homelessness in
Washington D.C.

“I enjoyed having dinner
with a homeless person because
it put me in a totally new and un-
expected situation from which I
was able to learn,” he said.

The 14 participants stayed at
the Headquarters of the group’s
host organization: the Center for
Student Missions.

Beyond their service to the

city, the group also spent a lot of
time thinking about God’s con-
cern for the poor and how their
lives could change to reflect his
concern. GCF Campus Staff
Member, Steve Tamayo said this
was his favorite part ofthe trip.

“I enjoyed the chance to make
deeper connections with the
folks on our team and to see God
expand their hearts for the poor,”
Tamayo said.

Nonetheless, Tamayo enjoyed
every aspect of the trip. When
asked what he enjoyed most

school programs and day care centers

about it, he responded, “It’s hard
to pick a “most.”

The group of 14 really bonded
together to make for a successful
trip. GCF leader, junior, Crystal
Spencer, commented that the
group really “meshed well.” A
strong close-knit group deﬁnitely
helped GCF complete its goal of
going as servants to a place they
would normally go as tourists.

Printer problems are becoming a major issue on campus

When the entire printer system crashes during midterms, Jarrett Brotzman needs a moment to vent

By Jarrett Brotzman
STAFF WRITER

The current state oftechnoIo-
gy at Washington and Lee is un-
acceptable. Computers that don‘t
work, printers that don’t print
and an email client that classi-
ﬁes Sakai email as junk are just
a few of the everyday problems
that accompany the otherwise
excellent student experience
here in Lexington.

Typically, I am not one to
publicly complain about these
issues. For the most part, stu-
dents here accept the poor state

 

of affairs as the unfortunate sta-
tus quo: an annoyance that one
learns to deal with. It is normal
for a C-School student to lose
work on Excel spreadsheets or
to expect a computer to take six
or seven minutes to boot up. This
is odd, as W&L makes claims of
at least adequately equipping
students.

As a student, I have dealt
with this over my past two and a
halfyears here. But the week be-
fore February Break, the system
completely broke down, and I
felt that I had to say something.

For many, myself included,

iiotheecilior

Men can make a di

the week before February Break
is midterm week. As part of my
midterm assignments, I had tests
and papers~and, like most stu-
dents, I need to print off papers
and study guides. However, on
this Thursday night, I found my-
self completely unable to use the
university printers.

Now this wasn’t just the case
with one printer in the Science
center. I found out, through the
process of attempting to use the
computers in most buildings on
the Hill, that the entire network
was down.

Perhaps I could understand if

°eI'ence

Men at Washington and Lee need to understand the
sexual assualt plight and be aware of the facts

Sexual assault is the Inost
serious problem facing Wash-
ington and Lee. W&L’s National
College Health Assessment sur-
vey in 2008 showed that female
students on this campus were
twice as likely as their national
peers to have experienced sexual
assault. This is totally unaccept-
able. Fortunately, there are steps
that male students can take to
end sexual assault at W&L.

For men, it all begins with
awareness. Too often I have en-
countered young men at W&L
who are skeptical about the sexu-
al assault statistics at this school.
Now it is true that college is a
place to question received wis-
dom. Socrates himself told his
students to question everything.

But those who question the
accuracy of the sexual assault
statistics have no evidence to
justify their skepticism.

I suspect that many of their
doubts arise from a desire to
sweep this inconvenient truth un-
der the rug. To confront a prob-
lem of such magnitude seems
potentially messy and certain to
upset the status quo.

A minority ofmen are respon-

sible for perpetrating sexual as-
sault at W&L. But a majority of
men bear the blame for failing to
take this problem seriously. Why
is this‘? As a man. it is not easy
to place yourself in the shoes of
a sexual assault victim. I think
back to Professor Bidlack’s
Soviet history course when he
spoke about the 1932-33 fam-
ine in the Ukraine that took the
lives of millions of people. Dur-
ing that lecture I raised my hand
and told him that, frankly. I was
having a hard time identifying
with the starvation victims. I’ve
never been hungry a day in my
life, so the idea of dying for lack
of food is completely foreign to
me. Similarly, I’ve never been
sexually assaulted, so the idea
of sexual assault is at best an
abstraction. But for millions of
women around the world, and
hundreds on this campus, sexual
assault is not a statistic or an ab-
straction. It is a grim reality.
Male students at W&L must
make an extra effort to under-
stand the gravity of the crisis.
The university could help by re-
quiring all ﬁrst-year students to
take a one-credit course cover-

ing health-related topics includ-
ing sexual assault. This idea has
been batted around for a while,
and I’m proud to say it seems to
be gaining traction now. While I
will applaud this step, should it
come, it is not enough in and of
itself. Sexual assault prevention
education needs to be a continu-
ous part of the college experi-
ence.

Sexual assault and rape are
serious violations of a person’s
civil rights. As civilized people
we cannot tolerate these viola-
tions, just as we do not tolerate
lynching or segregation. Men at
W&L must come to terms with
the problem and do their part
to end it. Do not sit on the side-
lines. Become part of the solu-
tion. This is real. END IT.

MISSION STATEMENT: It is the mission of THE RING-TUM PHI to
accurately, truthfully, and thoroughly report news affecting the
Washington and Lee community for students, faculty, parents and

alumni. Our goal is to look deeper into news affecting campus life and

hold leaders accountable. Through our reporting, we aspire to spark
discussions that lead to discovering information that prompts change.

the printer system was offline for
an hour or two, or during a Fri-

the break that was forthcoming
at this point in time. But no, the
computing serviceswor whoever
manages the very basic system
of printers on campus—in their
inﬁnite wisdom decided that a
midweek maintenance period
during midtemts was the ideal
time to take them oﬁline.

If this type of tech issue was
an isolated incident, I would
not feel compelled to write this.

be able to build and maintain a
basic system of computers and
printers that simply work for its
students.

Even amid a signiﬁcant de-
cline in our endowment, I feel
as though maintenance of basic
student computing resources
should take some sort of prior-
ity in university expenditures. I
am not quite sure how much the
real cost of printing a page is,
but I suspect that the $.10 — $.25
charge per page is more than
enough to cover the maintenance
of our system.

I hope that this at least serves

to initiate some discussion in
the administration on the proper
course of action needed to rec-
tify this unacceptable condition.
We pride ourselves on being a
top elite liberal arts university. It
is too bad the priorities of the ad-
ministration do not serve to cre-
ate an environment on campus
that supports this point of pride.

Reading fast for children’s books

5' First Book is annual Speed Read competition raises money for books for lykes and tots, Fancy Dress tickets for winner

By Melissa Powell
smrr WRITER

First Book is putting students’ reading abilities to the test. The third annual Speed Read competition is being held this
‘ week in Elrod Commons to ben-
eﬁt local elementary schools.

Continuing until next Mon-
day, students can donate money
in exchange for 15 seconds to
read out loud as fast as they can.
Those who read the most words
will win. Multiple winners are
chosen and can receive a vari-
ety of prizes from the Univer-
sity bookstore and local busi-
nesses like Lexington Coffee
Shop, Pumpkinseeds and Alvin
Dennis.

The top prize is Fancy Dress
tickets.

The Speed Read booth will
be set up each school day from
10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and represen-
tatives from each sorority will
time participants.

First Book is a nonproﬁt or-
ganization that works to give
underprivileged children their
first new books.

The money raised from the
event will go to local elemen-
tary schools with large low-in-
come populations. Community
Liaison Chair Co-chair, Kara
Karcher, a junior, said First
Book allows the elementary
students to choose new books to
receive. The organization plans
to hand-deliver the books and
will hopefully have a reading
day with the students, Karcher
said.

“Helping these children gain
access to books is important be-
cause it helps to ensure that the
learning that takes place in the
school environment can be en-
riched in their homes through
the books we provide,” Karcher
said. “Reading is such an impor-
tant part of childhood; not only
is it a fun activity, [but] it’s an
essential skill that they will use
throughout their lives.”

Senior Jessie Wang founded
First Book at Washington and
Lee in 2007. Speed Read has
been an annual event ever since
the organization’s founding.
Wang said First Book also tries to
hold fundraisers outside ofW&L
in the Lexington and Rockbridge
County area. For example, the
organization held a fundraiser
during a Virginia Military lnsti-
tute football game last semester.

“it helps to bridge the gap
between W&L and the town.”
Wang said. “It also strengthens
Panhellenic spirit on campus be-
cause it gives all six sororities an
opportunity to work together for
a common cause.”

First Book is a national orga-
nization with hundreds of local
advisory boards, like the one at
W&L. Nationally, First Book
was founded by Kyle Zimmer, a
corporate lawyer from Washing-
ton, D.C. who tutored children
at an inner-city soup kitchen at

night. Zimmer noticed that the
children she tutored had no books
to read, and 80 percent of low-in-
coine preschool and after-school
programs had no age-appropriate
books for children.

Zimmer and two friends
started First Book to provide the
resources these facilities needed
Now, almost 20 years later, First
Book has delivered more than 65
million books to educational pro-
grams for children in the United
States and Canada.

Nationally, First Book accepts
monetary donations and large-
scale donations of new books
directly from publishers. First
Book does not accept donations
of new or used books directly
from individuals; however, its
Web site does provide an option
for individuals to mail in used
books for reselling or recycling,
with a portion of the proceeds
beneﬁtting First Book.

Karcher encourages students
to get involved with Speed Read
Week since it’s something that
makes a difference for children
in the area.

“Speed Read is a fast and fun
way to give back to the commu-
nity in a big way,” Karcher said.
“Every child should be given the
opportunity to own and enjoy
their own books.”

Alpha Delta Pi members Chase Noyes and Julia Farnham
monitor last year’s the Speed Read table in the Commons. All
six sororities work to support First Book during this week.

Actors, dancers head to “Chicago”

Spring musical makes winter debut as W&L dancers, thespians and singers take the stage in this sexy crowd-pleaser

By Katie Boe
STAFF WRITER

The curtain goes up on the
Robert O. and Elizabeth M.
Bentley Musical, “Chicago,”
on Thursday. The cast and crew
have put months of design, pro-
duction and rehearsal into the
musical in the hopes of enter-
taining the Washington and Lee
campus. This year, the theater
department chose to move what
had been the spring musical to
the winter term.

“We didn’t think there was
enough time during the new,
shortened spring term to inte-
grate all the technical elements
that go into the show,” said Owen
Collins, associate professor of
theater. “Putting on a show takes

a lot of time and work, and we
were not sure ifwe would be able
to accomplish it in a month.”
“Chicago” is certainly a
crowd-pleaser, and its success
both in theater and ﬁlm made it
a desirable choice. The process
for choosing a musical is gener-
ally a collaboration between the
theater and music departments.
Each department makes a list
of potential shows and presents
it to the other department. The
departments together make the
ﬁnal decision together.
“‘Chicago’ was a fun choice
because it combines comedy, a
strong plot, interesting charac-
ters and great dance,” said Col-

lins. “With the increase in dance
interest on campus, we really
wanted to choose a show that
had some great dancing!”

The theater department also
likes to choose from a variety of
genres as to diversify what the
campus can see. Past shows have
included operettas, straight coin-
edy and more contemporary, pop
choices.

This year’s musical features
15 W&L students in the cast who
have dedicated time to the show
since the middle of fall term. Ini-
tial music and dance rehearsals
began in the middle of fall, and
the time requirement has only in-
creased since then.

Noel Price, a ﬁrst-year cast
member, has had rehearsal from
7 to 10 pm. nearly every day in
February and from 6:30 to 11
p.m. every day in March until the
show opens.

“I’ve really enjoyed getting to
meet new people in the cast who
otherwise I probably wouldn’t
know. I also love ‘Chicago.’ It’s
one of those shows that everyone
wants to do,” said Price.

“The cast of the show is so
multi-talented,” Collins said.
“Some of the leads aren’t even
theater majors. I think this re-
ally reflects W&L’s campus as
so many of the students are in-
volved and successful in many

New tunes for winter

WL UR radio station highlights this month is new music

ByWLUR Staff
STAFF WRITERS

Four new reviews from four
different reviewers on our staff.
Let these satisfy your new music
craving:

Shout Out Louds
Work (Merge)

In theory, it should be hard to
be passionate about Shout Out
Louds’ music. After all, there are
plenty of bands doing really ﬁne
indie pop these days, particular-
ly from the band’s homeland of
Sweden. However, there’s some-
thing to be said for mastery of
one’s craft, and these guys have
had it going since their stunning
2005 debut Howl Howl GaffGaff
Work is their second record for
Merge—following up on 2007’s
quite good Our Ill W1Tlls—and it’s
their best, most complete LP yet.

As is the case with any good
band, Shout Out Louds can ap-
peal to lovers of other acts—like
Jens Lekman, Camera Obscura,
Peter Bjorn & John, Ra Ra Riot
and New Order—without sound-
ing exactly like any of them.
Adam Olenius’s songwriting is
top of the line, and his emotive-
yet-not-emo vocals ebb and flow
through the album’s 10 tracks.
Like Lekman, Olenius has been
living in Melbourne, Australia
recently, and with the rest of the
band scattered around the globe,
Work was put together piece by
piece. But the band’s proﬁciency,
combined with Phil Ek’s produc-
tion, eliminates any trace of dis-
jointedness.

In short, this is one of 2010’s
best pop records. Start with
“Walls,” “I999,” “Fall Hard” and

“Show Me Something New.”
Shearwater

Golden Archipelago
(Matador)

Can I tell you a secret? I didn’t
really like Shearwater’s previous
record Rook all that much as an
album, but pretended that I did
for a while because I really love
Okkervil River and, thus, really
love Shearwater by association
(not to mention their older stuff is
solid). So, when I listened to The
Golden Archipelago, I was pre-
pared to write a positive review,
even if it was just as personally
unsatisfying as Rook. Fortunate-
ly, the album is actually totally
amazing and I fell for it within
minutes.

Here’s a nice, appropriately
dramatic blurb from the band's
label, Matador:

“Shearwater continue to ex-
plore the beauty, menace, and fra-
gility of the natural world—and
that increasingly rare species, the
indivisible a1bum—on The Gold-
en Archipelago, the band’s most
absorbing and accomplished
work to date. The new record is
the third panel of a triptych that
includes 2006’s enigmatic Palo
Santa and 2008’s acclaimed
Rook, albums linked by themes
of environmental and personal
decay and humans’ impact on
nature. In The Golden Archipel-
ago, Shearwater turn to a portrait
of life on islandswa world of
alternating lushness and auster-
ity, numinous silences and sud-
den cataclysms, and the strange
flowerings of plant, animal and

The

human life that only arise in iso-
lation... The results are singular,
revelatory, and demand to be ap-
preciated as a whole. Islands un-
der siege, islands ofimpenetrable
solitude, islands of the world
and islands of the mind—all are
here in The Golden Archipelago,
whose shores and reefs ﬂicker
and beckon, even as they crum-
ble under rising seas.”
FOX Japan
Reenactment (Small War)

Having adored FOX Japan’s
music from the early days (hey,
being a friend of the bassist,
Washington and Lee’s own Sam
Wilmoth ’08, certainly has its
perks), I’m not surprised at what I
hear on Reenactment, the group’s
latest record. FOX Japan blends
sharp and intricate guitars with
sharp andjabbing lyrics, a strong
marriage of forms that makes
every listen a joy. Based out of
Morgantown, W. Va., brothers
Sam, Charlie and Pete Wilmoth
form the core of the band, with
Andrew Slater providing ﬁne
work on the six-string.

Fans of Talking Heads, Ok-
kervil River and the Pixies will
dig the songs on this one, particu-
larly “Hate Hate Them” and “The
Pedant.” Political songs tend
to make me a little uneasy, but
the Brothers Wilmoth are smart
about them (and watch out: one
of the most overtly rabble-rous-
ing, “Glenn Beck,” one of my
favorites on here, is riddled with
profanity). Catchy, off-kilter, and
cynical as hell, FOX Japan deliv-
ers on its promise of producing

Announcement ofa Fellowship for Members of the Rising Senior and Junior Classes

“catchy, word-drunk indie rock.”
Joe Pug
Messenger (Lightning Rod)

Paste Magazine tells it like it
is: “Pug’s scorching poetry and
soulful, ‘every phrase could be
my last’ voice will stop you cold.
If you want to read the actual
endorsement, touch the Braille
stretching up my arms.”

Joe Pug’s Messenger is a re-
freshingly unique album in an
oversaturated indie-folk world.

Last year, Pug’s EP Nation of

Heat graced WLUR’s playi-
ist. This full-length album will
surely make fans of that release
delighted, satisﬁed and excited
that Pug has once again deliv-
ered. Comparisons with Bob
Dylan’s poetically-rhythmic lyric
delivery are hard to avoid. Add-
ing to the Dylan parallels is Pug’s
scratchy folk voice that Paste so
eloquently endorses.

If you’re approaching this al-
bum with Nation ofHeat in mind,
you’ll notice more dynamics:
pedal steel, rhythm sections and
harmonies. If you’re new to Pug,
then you’ll be swept away by his
meticulous attention to his songs.
And the album’s production puts
you in the room with the music.
Out of the recent slew of folk re-
cords we’ve received at WLUR,
Messenger is certainly at the top
of my list. Start with “The First

»Time I Saw You,” “Disguised as
Someone Else” and “Messen-

as

ger.

different areas.”

The audition process for the
musical was competitive. Jeni
Pritchett, a sophomore and the
stage manager for the show, said
singing and a monologue pre-
sentation were required for the
audition.

“This year, we had to cut a lot
of really talented people simply
because there is a speciﬁc vi-
sion for a show of this caliber,”
Pritchett said.

There was also a dance portion
to the audition where auditioners
were taught a dance phrase and
then asked to perform it.

“The dance audition re-
ally shows your ability to learn

quickly and accurately [as well
as] your coordination and dance
skills,” Collins said.

The overall favorite number
in the show is the “Cellblock
Tango” which features six wom-
en in prison for killing their hus-
bands. “It’s so much fun and so
catchy,” Pritchett said.

“Chicago” will run from
March 11 to 14 at 7:30 p.m. in
the Keller Theater and is destined
to be a crowd-pleaser, Tickets are
available at the Box Office or at
lenfest.wlu.edu. Tickets are $5
for students and $8 for faculty
and staff.

Slim pickings in NFL free agency

New limits will cripple this year is free agency period creating a hodgepodge of players in the free agent pool

By Adam Cancryn
STAFF COLUMNIST

Add some garden gnomes and used
furniture, and the 2010 NFL free agent
pool might be mistaken for a yard sale.

In one comer is running back La-
Dainian Tomlinson. A former all-pro
and 2006 MVP, the San Diego Chargers
unceremoniously cut him following two
injury-plagued years.

Sitting with the toddler toys is wide-
out Terrell Owens. He made ﬁve con-
secutive Pro Bowls at one point and was
considered a near-lock Hall of Famer.
But a decline in productivity and an in-
crease in ego have left Owens without a
team for the second time in two years.

Right behind him, mixed in with the
old clothes, is 34-year-old Chad Pen-
nington. The noodle-armed quarterback
is on the move again after losing his
starting job in Miami. He has yet to start
back-to-back full seasons over his 10-
year career.

It wasn’t supposed to be this way.
Thanks to an expiring labor contract,
the 2010 season is uncapped, meaning
that there is no limit on how much teams

can spend on players. On the surface,
this sounded like a great opportunity.
Freed from the ﬁnancial conﬁnes of the
salary cap, teams could overhaul their
rosters by simply throwing money at the
top free agents. The NFL’s competitive
landscape would shift radically as teams
made improvements that, normally,
would take years to complete.

The players were ecstatic too. At no
other point would competition for their
services be this high. Free agents would
get to pick from numerous bidders, who
would drive prices to an all—time high in
their desire to get the most out of this
rare opportunity. Everyone would get
rich.

But when free agency ﬁnally did be-
gin at midnight on March 5, there was
no stampede of owners dragging bags
of money. In fact, because of ﬁne print
clauses and unconventional regulations,
this uncapped year might amount to a
whole lot of nothing.

The NFL and the Players Association
are entering the last year oftheir collec-

tive bargaining agreement. The CBA is
a union contract negotiated between the
players and the league that sets rules sur-
rounding treatment of the athletes, from
practice schedules to retirement beneﬁts
to contract negotiations. And while the
CBA calls for an uncapped ﬁnal year,
it also sets limits that will cripple this
year’s free agency period.

In the past, players could ﬁle for un-
restricted free agency after their four-
year contract had expired. But in 2010,
players are not unrestricted until after
six seasons. So anyone whose four-year
contract has ended instead becomes a
restricted free agent. Teams can make
offers to a restricted player, but if they
choose to sign him, they must surren-
der high draft picks to the original team
as compensation. Unrestricted players
come with no such requirements.

For teams that ﬁnished in the top
eight in the league last year, it is even
tougher to successfully court a free
agent. As a measure added to prevent
the best teams from getting exponential-

ly better, the top eight must lose a play-
er to free agency before they can sign
one. Furthermore, the salary they offer
a free agent cannot be any larger than
that of the player they lost. This means
that teams like the Saints, Colts, Jets and
Vikings are automatically out of the run-
ning for top players like Julius Peppers,
who will likely command a salary well
into eight ﬁgures.

The rules might be complex, but the
takeaway is this: few young stars will
test the market, leaving teams to sift
through a smaller pile of aging, high-
risk players.

Of the unsigned top 100 free agents
according to Yahoo! Sports, 63 are re-
stricted, while just 30 are unrestricted.
Additionally, restricted free agents are
signiﬁcantly younger, and therefore
more valuable, than unrestricted free
agents.

The restricted class, boasting rising
stars like Texans LB Demeco Ryans
and Dallas WR Miles Austin, is an aver-
age of 27.6 years old. The average age

of unrestricted free agents is 31.5. That
gap makes a huge difference in a league
where the average career length is just
three and a half years.

Even more unfortunate for teams
looking to improve is that, after Peppers
and linebacker Karlos Dansby, there are
few attractive options on the unrestricted
market. Pennington, the best available
QB, hasn’t proven he can stay healthy
for any length of time. Tomlinson, Brian
Westbrook and Larry Johnson were a
top trio a few years ago, but they have
all begun the rapid descent that hampers
running backs over 30.

What will likely come out of this
disappointing free agent class is an in-
crease in off-season trades. Unwilling to
lose draft picks or gamble on an aging
player, most teams will bypass the CBA
restrictions and deal directly with other
franchises. ,

As for the players, they will continue
to sit amongst the old books and dusty
lamps, trying to distinguish themselves
as a gem in a yard full of clutter.

Generals win ODACs, but fall in NCAAs

The Washington and Lee women 3 basketball team won its ﬁrst ever ODAC championship and set a new program record with 18 wins

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee women’s
basketball team’s Cinderella story was
cut short this weekend when the 2010
ODAC champions (18-10) fell to unde-
feated Christopher Newport, 68-51.

The Generals just couldn’t keep up
with the Captains’ fast-paced offense.
An early six-point lead was all CNU
needed to secure the victory. CNU led
by 40-24 at halftime and its lead would
never waiver.

The Generals couldn’t get the ball in
the basket—shooting only 37.5 percent
for the game—or grab the ball off the
backboard, falling behind 21-34 on re-
bounds.

“We went in thinking we had a good
chance to win, so it deﬁnitely was dis-
appointing,” said sophomore forward
Becca Bolton.

But the bittersweet ending marks the
close of a record-setting season and a
breadth of accomplishments. W&L ﬁn-
ished the season with 18 wins, the most
in program history, and the team’s ﬁrst-
ever ODAC championship.

Head Coach Mandy King “has been
talking since the beginning about cut-
ting down nets and I’m not sure if any of
us realized we could do that,” said ﬁrst-
year Katy Wilson. “We had good run at

the end... We played good team ball.”

The Generals ﬁnished the regular
season by setting a program record for
conference victories at 14. They defeat-
ed Bridgewater 67-53 at home in their
ﬁnal regular season game. The win was
enough to give W&L a No. 3 seed in the
ODAC Tournament over Washington
Break.

But No. 3 on the books ﬁnished No.
1 on the podium. The Generals found
their stride at the Salem Civic Center,
and their play was nothing short of
magical. Boosted by double-doubles
from both Bolton and junior center Fe-
lice Herman, the Generals took down
Guilford, 72-66, in the ﬁrst round of the
tournament. Bolton’s 17 points and 14
rebounds gave the sophomore her 14th
double-double of the season. Herman’s
13 points and 10 rebounds marked her
fourth double-double of the season.

The win marked just the third time
in W&L women’s basketball team his-
tory that the team has advanced past the
ﬁrst round of the ODAC tournament.
The last team to make it this far was the
2006-2007 team.

W&L’s shooting hot streak cooled
off against Eastem Mennonite in the
next round. The Generals shot only 37.5

percent from the ﬁeld, but grit and en-
durance helped keep their tournament

helps when you have people like Becca
[Bolton] who can get points and assists.

Head coach Mandy King “has been talking since the

beginning about cutting down nets and I ’m not sure if

any of us realized we could do that. ”

Katy Wilson, forward

run alive. W&L rebounded from its slow
ﬁrst-halfperformance with a 12-0 run to
tie the game with just under 10 minutes
remaining. The Generals put turnovers
and sloppy play behind them and domi-
nated the scoreboard throughout the rest
of the game.

Sophomore guard Meg Ingram put
up 16 points for the Generals while ju-
nior guard Allie Long added 12 points.
Wilson had nine points and 10 boards,
making her mark on the tournament
run. ’

“If something’s not going my way,
I try to do stuff 1 can control, like get-
ting rebounds,” Wilson said. “Plus it

The scoring is really equal. It’s easy to
perfonn well with a team like that.”

Facing their ﬁrst ODAC champi-
onship contest ever, game-time jitters
weighed heavily on the Generals when
they took on Virginia Wesleyan Univer-
sity. But no Cinderella story is complete
without the glass slipper, and W&L de-
feated VWU 64-56 to claim its ﬁrst-ever
ODAC Championship title and an auto-
matic bid to the NCAA tournament.

W&L led early on in the game, but
shooting woes kept the team scoreless
for a good part of the ﬁrst half and the
Generals were down 32-23 heading into
halftime.

With the nerves out of their system,
the Generals came out of the locker
room ready to play. W&L used a 9-0 run
to tie the game at 32-32 with 15:21 to
play. W&L and VWU traded baskets,
but it was the Generals who ultimately
pulled away. Fittingly, it was Bolton
who gave the Generals the ultimate
lead. The guard hit a lay-up that surged
the Generals ahead 50-49. They never
looked back.

Bolton put up her 15th double-dou-
ble for the season with 14 points, 10
rebounds, ﬁve assists and four steals.
Wilson had another stellar rookie perfor-
mance for the Generals with a double-
double of her own with 13 points and 10
rebounds. Both Bolton and Wilson were
named to the all-toumament team.

“I think we’ve ﬁnally gotten more
respect,” Wilson said. “People didn’t re-
ally know who we were... We have to
keep it up at a high level. We’re retum-
in g all ﬁve starters, so people are expect-
ing a lot from us next season.”

Men’s basketball drops to VWC in ODACS

W&L defeated Emory and Henry 92-60 in the first round but dropped a tough 85-80 loss to lﬁrginia Wesleyan

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDIOTR

The Washington and Lee men’s bas-
ketball team may have missed out on the
ODAC Championships, but the 2009-
2010 was not without its glory. The
Generals ﬁnished the season at 17-10,
the most single-season wins earned by a
W&L team since the 1988-1989 season.

“l7 wins with such a young team is
a huge success,” said junior guard Jason
Cimino. “Also, 1 think it’s a good mea-
suring stick that we played our best bas-
ketball at the end of the year.”

The No. 6-seeded Generals swatted
the Emory and Henry College Wasps,
92-60, in the ﬁrst round of the ODAC
tournament. The winning 92-point total
was the highest scoring game for the
Generals this season. The Generals came
out ﬁring and a 45.7 shooting percentage
in the ﬁrst half helped give them a 33-7
run to close out the half. The Generals
went into the locker room up 43-23.

And the shots just kept falling in the
second half. The Generals kept up their
accuracy, drilling 44.4 percent from be-

hind the three-point line. The No. 11-
seeded Wasps committed 17 turnovers
with only nine assists, compared to
W&L’s 11 turnovers and 15 assists.

The Generals also towered over the
Wasps on the boards, outrebounding
them 46-25.

Senior forward Andrew Payne, in his
last game in the Warner Center, contrib-
uted 21 points for a career high. Fellow
senior forward Ben Goetsch added 11
points. Sophomore guard Jon Guest put
up 12 points and Cimino added 10.

“Personally, I thought I played well,”
Cimino said. “When you get into games
like those, when it’s win or go home, it’s
a matter of not wanting to lose.”

The Generals next hit the road for
the ODAC quarterﬁnals and a match-up
against’ No. 3 seed Virginia Wesleyan
College. W&L led for the majority of
the game, but the Generals couldn’t hold
on for the win and they dropped out of
championship contention with an 85-80
loss.

“The Virginia Wesleyan game was
tough,” Cimino said. “I thought we had
a great chance to win; we just didn’t
come up with the big play.”

The two teams traded baskets in the
ﬁrst half with neither team leading by
more than six. W&L shot 47.2 percent
for the half versus the Marlins’ 43.8 per-
cent.

The edge allowed the Generals to
pull away toward the end of the half and
they came into the second with a 42-37
lead.

The Generals kept their lead alive
well into the second half. Virginia Wes-
leyan pulled ahead only once, with a 43-
42 lead ﬁve minutes into the half.

That lead didn’t even last a full 30
seconds before Payne dished out a layup
to move the Generals back up.

But the Marlins weren’t done ﬁght-
ing. They pulled ahead again, 56-54 with
9:08 left in the half, and the Generals
just couldn’t regain their momentum.

Goetsch closed out his W&L ca-

reer with a double-double. He put up
19 points and 11 rebounds to lead the
Generals. Payne added 11 points, six
rebounds and three assists in his ﬁnal

teammate I’ve ever had. They are win-
ners, and that’s the highest compliment I
can give them.”

Cimino complemented the seniors

“I 7 wins with such a young team is a huge success.

Also, I think its a good measuring stick that we played
our best basketball at the end of the year ”

Jason Cimino, guard

showing.

“The three seniors [Goetsch, Payne,
and forward Zac White] are unbeliev-
able,” Cimino said. “They’ve done so
much for this program, it’s wild. Ben
[Goetsch] is the hardest-working team-
mate I’ve ever had. Zac is the best player
I’ve ever played with. Payne is the best

with a career-high 18 points, three as-
sists and three steals, showing that he’s
more than ready to ﬁll the senior leader-
ship position next year.

Back-to-back wins

Men is lax defeated Greensboro College 9-4 and Washington College 9-5

By Henri Hammond-Paul
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee Generals
Men’s Lacrosse team improved to 5-0
with back-to-back wins over Greensboro
College and Washington College.

On a cold and cloudy Wednesday, the
Generals came out to play against Greens-
boro and posted a 9-4 victory.

Facing off against Greensboro, ﬁrst-
year attack Mac Means started the scor-
ing at 8:42 in the ﬁrst quarter off an assist
from senior midﬁelder Max Mancuso.

Means led the team with three goals
and one assist, showing great promise for
his rookie season. Senior Kevin Feeney
and sophomore Rob Look, the General’s
faceoff specialists, controlled this game,
winning 10 out of 16 between the two of
them. .

But the big story of the game was the
Generals’ defense. Senior goalkeeper Matt
Mason played for 56:54 minutes, leaving
only for a brief injury. Mason posted nine
saves and let in only four goals. The Gen-
erals’ defense kept Greensboro’s offense
away from the ball and only allowed them
25 shots.

The Generals outshot Greensboro by
15 with a total of 40 shots on goal. Senior
Captain and attack Will Keigler chipped in
two goals and one assist and sophomore
attack Scott Meehan tallied one goal and
two assists.

The following Saturday the No. 10-
ranked Generals came out to a full crowd
and warm weather to face mid-Atlantic
powerhouse Washington College. The
Generals were up to the challenge and
they outscored WAC 9-5. The Gener-
als’ defense may have been dominant on
Wednesday, but team chemistry was the
key to getting thejob done against WAC.

“All year we had been led by our de-
fense and goaltending, which have the
ability to keep us in any game even if our
offense is struggling,” said sophomore

Sam Mott. “Against WAC, we showed
signs with some of the best offense we
had had all year, especially in the 2nd
quarter.”

Junior midﬁelder Drew Koeneman
led the team with two goals and one as-
sist, while Keigler and Means paced the
offense with two points each. With this
game now in his pocket, Keigler is only 24
points away from being the all time lead-
ing point-getter at W&L. He presently has
168 total points and is sixth on the list of
overall points in W&L lacrosse history.

Mason posted eight saves and only
allowed ﬁve goals off of WAC’s total 29

shots in the game. While the game statis-
tics were pretty even between the teams-
each team had 29 shots on goal, 8 saves,
and 30 tumovers—W&L dominated the
pace and controlled the play for the major-
ity ofthe game.

W&L has some solid wins under its
belt, but the Generals will face a challeng-
ing lineup starting on March 9 when they
play Ohio Wesleyan at home at 7 p.m.
They will then travel to Franklin and Mar-
shall on Mar. 13.

Baseball improves to 2-5

W&L ran over Southern Virginia 12-3 and split games with Lynchburg

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee baseball team
started moving in the right direction this
past week with a l2-3 win over Southern
Virginia and split against Lynchburg, go-
ing 1-3 and 9-2 for the Generals. The team
suffered through a rough opening week in
Atlanta during Washington Break as they
dropped all four contests against Emory,
Piedmont, and two against Oglethorpe. The
team could have cited the abnormally cold
weather and copious amounts of snow that
hindered preseason practice as the reason
for the slow start, but made no such excus-
es. Instead, the defending ODAC champs
came home and immediately erased that
zero in the win column.

On Wednesday, SVU came to visit
Cap’n Dick Smith Field and W&L, to put
it simply, gave ’em the business. The Gen-
erals would eventually win by a score of
12-3, but victory did not look so certain
at ﬁrst. Sophomore pitcher Roger Strong
started the game for W&L and escaped the
ﬁrst inning with the bases loaded and no
runs scored. The team’s ace, senior pitcher
Chuck Davidson, took over in the third in-
ning and soon ran into some trouble. SVU
tagged him for three runs en route to jump-
ing out to a 3-1 lead. But that would be the
only offense for SVU the rest of the day.

On a chilly day, W&L’s bats came alive
as the top ﬁve hitters in the lineup went
a combined ll-l9 with 10 runs batted in.
Second baseman senior John Ditore lead

the way for the Generals with four hits and
four runs scored. Senior pitcher Nate Ad-
kins picked up the win for W&L. A visibly
frazzled Nick Denny took the loss both
literally and physically for SVU. (A large
contingent of Betas in the stands should be
given credit for knocking the lefty offhis
game with their verbal onslaughts).

Three days later the team boarded the
bus and traveled to rival Lynchburg for a
Saturday double—hcader. The story of the
ﬁrst game was Lynchburg’s starting pitch-
er Connor Thompson. Thompson hurled
seven innings for the Hornets, allowing
only one earned run and scattering a mere
ﬁve hits. Ditore continued his recent suc-
cess by singling and eventually scoring
in the ﬁrst inning on a sacriﬁce ﬂy off the
bat of senior ﬁrst baseman Hunter Seren-
betz. But that would be the last time W&L
would light up the run column in that con-
test, eventually losing by a score of 3-l.

Davidson battled Thompson throughout
his six strong innings of work for W&L,
but eventually took the hard luck loss. Di-
tore ﬁnished 3-5 andjunior outﬁelder An-
thony Cardona posted his second straight
2-4 day at the plate.

But the second game was a completely
different story. Strong went seven innings
for W&L, keeping Lynchburg at bay and
W&L in the game long enough for a sev-
enth inning rally. Down 2-1 in the seventh,
the Generals exploded for six runs en route

to a 9-2 win.

Freshman shortstop Jonathan Stutts
lifted the sacriﬁce fly that scored senior
C] Thompson and gave W&L the lead for
good in the middle of the seventh.

“It was good to come back and get a
win in the second game,” said Stutts of
the team’s effort. “It was nice to see the
team rebound like that. I would deﬁnitely
say we were happy splitting games with a
tough conference opponent.”

Senior third baseman Jim Plantholt
went 3-5 in the second game; sophomore
outﬁelder Mike Decembrino, Serenbetz,
and Ditore all added two base hits and two
RBl’s. Ditore has been making his pres-
ence felt the past three games with nine
hits in 15 at bats, good enough for a spar-
kling .600 batting average.

With an overall record of 2-5 and con-
ference record of 1-1, the Generals are
slowly climbing out of the early season
hole they dug for themselves. Defense is
what needs to be improved the most to get
back to .500, said Stutts.

"We just have to eliminate little mis-
takes in the ﬁeld and keep pitching well,”
he said. “The hits are there; wejust have to
work on closing some games.”

The Generals travel to Easte1nMenno—
nite on Tuesday. First pitch of that game
is at 3 p.m.

Women’s lax improves record

The Generals defeat Bridgewater but lose to Franklin and Marshall

By Lizz Dye
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee women’s la-
crosse team smashed Bridgewater College
20-4 on the road last Tuesday, but fell to
top-ranked Franklin and Marshall 16-8 on
Saturday.

The 16th-ranked Generals (2-1, 1-0
ODAC) scored eight consecutive goals in
the ﬁrst half of their victory over Bridge-
water and went into half-time leading 8-O.

Senior attacker Britten Mathews, ju-
nior attackers Kate Speare and Ellie Van
Sant, and sophomore attacker Maddie
McKaig all earned hat tricks in the vic-
tory. Mathews and Speare also recorded
an assist apiece. Junior midﬁelder Emmy
Mathews and ﬁrst year midﬁelder Ashley
Barnes scored two goals each, and junior
attacker Wilton Megargel, ﬁrst-year at-
tacks Mary Jennings Van Sant and Eliza-
beth Bucklee, and sophomore midﬁelder
Alexis Harrison scored one goal apiece.

The Generals played both a strong offen-
sive and defensive game.

Junior goalkeeper Katharine F arrar and
ﬁrst-year goalkeeper Alex Hamill each
saved two goals and allowed two goals.

“While Bridgewater is not our strongest
competition, a decisive win really showed
how far we have come as a team since last
week,” said Emmy Matthews.

It was deﬁnitely a strong win for the
Generals and an excellent preview for the
competition the women’s lacrosse team
will bring to the ()DAC tournament.

Facing off against Franklin and Mar-
shall, junior midﬁelder Kate Donnelly put
in the ﬁrst goal for the Generals. F&M
responded by netting ﬁve goals over the
next ten minutes. Sophomore midﬁelder
Christina Benedetti and Mathews added
two more goals in the ﬁrst half. But it
wasn’t enough to take down the Franklin

and Marshall lead, and the Diplomats had
an 8-3 lead at halftime.

Benedetti ﬁnished with three goals.
l)onnelly, Mathews, senior attacker Mere-
dith Freeman, Megargel, and Bucklee also
contributed goals to the ﬁnal score. McK-
aig had an assist. Farrar played the whole
game in net for the Generals and recorded
13 saves.

After the defeat, Mathews said that the
team “has come a long way, but they still
have a long way to go.”

“We know what we need to shoot for
and the aspects of our game we need to
ﬁx before tournament time,” said Emmy
Mathews.

The Generals return to action as they
travel to Sweet Briar for a 4: l 5 p.m.
match-up this Tuesday.

VOLUME CXIII, NUMBER 16

J ohnsons come
out to play

185 hopeful students

experience collegiate life

By Katy Stewart
smrr wrmsn

Some 185 high school seniors descended on Wash-
ington and Lee’s campus Tuesday for the ﬁnal inter-
views for the Johnson Scholarship, just as Lexington
welcomed its warmest weather in months.

The sunny weather was good news for the Johnson
program, which sets itself apart from other scholarship
programs by hosting ﬁnalists for three days. Just as
applicants look different on paper versus in person,
so do schools. So showcasing Lexington’s beautiful
weather only enhanced W&L’s image. When these
high achievers are choosing between the Ivy League
and W&L, the campus is a key marketing tool.

“The campus sells itself,” said chief scholarship
coordinator Erin Hutchinson, especially when many
students have never visited W&L before. Sitting in
on classes gave prospectives a glimpse into academic

life, and staying in the dorms gave students a chance '

to see what real dorm living is like.

According to admissions director Jonathan Web-
ster, the honor system, leadership, and civic respon-
sibility were the impetus for the Johnson Scholarship,
created three years ago after Rupert Johnson (’62)
donated $100 million, W&L’s largest single donation
to date. These are the qualities that set W&L apart,
and “are the things people love about the school,”
Webster said.

Hutchinson and the admissions team devoted the
last six weeks to organizing interviews and activities
for the ﬁnalists. The team kept ﬁnalists busy, not just
with interviews, but with teambuilding activities and
events designed to showcase W&L.

But the most important part of the week for these
students was the interview process. Finalists were
selected from a pool of about 2,200 applicants, and
all exemplify academic excellence, as well as leader-
ship outside the classroom. The Johnson program is
not looking for “cookie cutter” students, Hutchinson
said. Leadership can be through service, athletics,
work experience or the arts. Johnson Scholars all have
different experiences and backgrounds, Hutchinson
said. The scholarship rewards students who will “bring
something to enrich W&L. Not just to be involved, but
to enrich.” Added admissions director Robert Koch,
“We’re looking for movers and shakers.”

The admissions team has found that more students
apply each year, making selection more competitive.
The biggest change in applicants is the “volume and
depth of the pool,” said admissions director Aaron
Fulk. Of the 2,200 applicants, approximately 10
percent are named as ﬁnalists and invited to campus.
The school offers more Johnson Scholarships than
are accepted, but approximately 35 ‘to 40 enroll.
Feedback from winners who decline includes many
factors, but often points to the intense social scene
and small town.

With higher application rates each year, the team
made changes to the ﬁnalist week in order to accom-
modate the increasingly competitive process. Most no-
tably, the faculty interview and peer interview merged
into one combined panel. Hutchinson said the change
was “appropriate” to the nature of the school and the
scholarship. The school prides itself on student self-
govemance, so current Johnsons should “be involved
in selecting their successors,” she said.

Also, more activities were planned for the ﬁnalists
than the two previous years, with a Student Showcase
and a scavenger hunt. The Showcase was opened to
the entire student body and featured W&L favorites
like Southern Comfort, the school’s all-male a capella
group. The scavenger hunt encouraged students both
to ﬁnd out more about W&L and Lexington, and to
work together as a team to solve the clues.

Bringing an additional 1 85 people onto campus cre-
ated challenges. The team coordinated each student’s
travel itinerary and planned class visits that matched
each student’s indicated academic interests. In order to
do this, admissions staff had to clear particular classes
with professors. An intricate puzzle was ﬁtting extra
students into classrooms because “we don’t have big
classrooms,” Hutchinson said. For example, Profes-
sor Brian Richardson’s Journalism 101 class, which
usually seats 16 students, more than doubled when 20
Johnson ﬁnalists sat it on Wednesday morning.

The Johnson Scholarship presents a unique oppor-
tunity, offering a merit-based scholarship to approxi-
mately 10 percent of the incoming class. The scope of
this grant, relative to the size of the student body, sets
the Johnson apart from other scholarships. Hutchinson
ﬁnds the selection process rewarding because it makes
the school available to anyone, regardless of ability or
willingness to pay. “After living the W&L experience,
think how thankful they are to have this opportunity,
thanks to the Johnson,” she said.

Drug

takes a hi

. SJC drops constructive possession
cases and plans to rethink the policy

for next year

By Kelsy Mccraw
STAFF WRITER

A I4-student case brought before
the Student Judicial Council involving
illegal drugs has forced the council
members to rethink the newly exposed
“constructive possession” policy.

The case emerged several weeks
ago. From the outset, it sparked a
huge level of student concern and
media attention.

The students, who will remain
anonymous because of a conﬁdential-
ity code enforced by the SJC, received
sanctions because they were found in
the same room as other students who
were using drugs.

These students, who were not
using drugs themselves, felt unfairly
convicted because they were unaware
ofthis policy.

‘:We really weren’t worried about
our case until our honor advocates
told us about the idea of constructive
possession,” said one of the students
who was involved in the case. “ltjust
seems unfair that we got punished for
something we didn’t know about.”

Under the constructive possession
policy, students are held accountable
for being in an enclosed room with
full knowledge of illegal activity such
as drug use.

The SJC began consistently using
the policy this year. However, the
policy does not appear in the student

polic

handbook due to an oversight by the
SJC.

The SJC dropped the possession
charges for those 12 of the 14 students
who had been convicted under the
premise of constructive possession.
The decision was announced late last
Monday afternoon.

Crighton Allen, chairman of the
SJC, acknowledged that the policy

dent. “I didn’t possess any drugs."

Upon further reflection of the
policy, the SJC has decided to stop
using constructive possession until a
better, clearer policy can be laid out
to students.

The philosophy behind the policy
is still something that the SJC will
incorporate into the handbook next
year. Nevertheless, the terminology

“I do want to see a decrease in drug use on

campus, but that just wash ’1‘ the way to do it.

J

T hat 3 just not fair. ’

CRIGHTON ALLEN, SJC Chairman . .
 

was unfair. He also said it proved to
be ineffective.

‘‘[It] doesn’t deter people who.

were going to do bad things. It only
punishes people who weren’t,” he
said.

One of the students whose cases
were dropped said that the SJC’s
reevaluation of the constructive pos-
session cases came as a relief.

‘‘I’m very relieved,” said this stu-

and charge will be different.

Right now, the SJC wants to move
away from the term “constructive pos-
session,” because it implies some sort
ofpossession when none has actually
occurred.

With this implication, students in
the same room as other students using
illegal substances had been officially
found guilty of possession. The only
differentiation between “constructive

  
 

possession” and actual possession was
made in terms of sanctions.

Allen said the SJC might change
the charge of possession to a charge
of conduct unbecoming of a W&L
student. He is currently discussing the
issue with Associate Dean of Students
Brandon Dotson. The two will reach a
decision on how to handle these kinds
of cases by next year.

There will be an addendum in next
year’s handbook that will explain the
policy and how cases of this nature
will be handled.

While “constructive possession”
has been shelved for the time being,
Allen said that the SJC and the ad-
ministration remain adamant in their
stance against illegal substances.

“I do want to see a decrease in drug
use on campus, but that just wasn’t
the way to do it. That’sjust not fair,”
he said.

Writer’s tale of poverty

Annual Tom Wolfe speaker takes on “Hardship, Resilience and the Art of the Memoir”

By Randi Wilson
STAFF WRITER

Jeannette Walls was once a ce-
lebrity gossip columnist who went
to fancy dinners, galas and other
schmooze-worthy functions.

While walking to one of these
events, she saw her mother on the
streetﬁhomeless.

When Walls asked her what she
should say when people asked about
her, she replied, “Just tell the truth.”

It is this scene that grabs the read-
er in the opening scene of her mem-
oir, “The Glass Castle,” which she
recounted to her audience at the Tom
Wolfe Weekend Seminar on Friday.

The truth, Walls said, was that she
had spent 15 years like that.

“I grew up po’—we couldn’t even
afford the last two letters.”

It took her 20 years to come for-
ward with her story. She was afraid
that by telling the world that she was
not raised in a wealthy home, she
would lose the place she had created
for herself in society. But her moth-
er’s words stuck with her.

She faced countless challenges in
writing the memoir. For instance, she
was unsure how to depict her mother,
whose optimism was so blinding that
she didn’t realize how terrible life
was for her children.

“Things will always work out in
the end,” her mother would say.

“Well what if they don’t, mom?”
Walls would ask.

“Then you haven’t reached the
end yet,” her mother would reply.

Another challenge was that at
times she found her storytelling
voice would default into a journal-
istic voiee. It was an unconscious
defense.

In the early 1990s, Cumming was
ajournalist for The Atlanta Journal-
Constitution and worked on a section
of“News for Kids” in which the ﬁrst
Gulf War was explained in a way
that eight year-olds could easily un-
derstand.

It was a favorite section of peo-
ple of all ages because it was ﬁlled

“We can understand our stories better by

I

hearing others ’. ’

t

Jeannette Walls, author and keynote speaker

Walls wouldn’t tell the reader how
to feel, but rather tell them, “This
is what happened. Make up your
own mind.” She would also write
“as though it happened to someone
else.”

Associate Professor of Journal-
ism Doug Cumming, who attended
the lecture, did not agree that the two
writing styles are necessarily differ-
ent.

“Good journalism is good story-
telling,” Cumming said.

with clear facts without unnecessary
“gobbledygook.” They contained
a “basic eternal truth” which could
connect to adults and children alike,
Cumming said.
Cumming

said that a writer

doesn’t need to tell readers what her
work should mean to them. But read-
ers must be able to understand what
they are reading for it to mean any-
thing.

Walls wanted her story to be un-
derstood by more than just adults.

“We can understand our stories bet-
ter by hearing others’,” she said.

Her dream in sharing her story

Nancy’s rampage and ObamaCare blindly plow forward

Regardless of public opinion, the Democrats will stop at nothing to get their version of health care reform passed.

By Jarrett Brotzman
c 0 L U M N IS T

Democrats are starting to feel
a bit uneasy after this past week,
as President Barack Obama
ramped up political and media
pressure on dissenters of his
healtch care reform plans while
Speaker Nancy Pelosi went vote
bartering, offering special legis-
lative treats.

Why can’t these unsure Dem-
ocratic congressmen shut their
mouths and just vote?

But amid the overly generous
pork that Pelosi, White House
Chief of Staff strong-arm Rahm
Emanuel and the rest of the gang
are dishing out (my favorite: the
“Gator Aid” that singles out and
exempts over 800,000 Florida
seniors from key Medicare cuts
in the current Senate bill), some
Democrats just aren’t biting.

The ﬁscal concerns related to
this bill have made many moder-
ates uneasy. Ofﬁcial claims from
the White House estimate the to-
tal cost of the entire ObamaCare
bill to cost around $950 billion
over the next 10 years.

To make the deal even sweet-
er, the package will be paid for
by cuts to health—care providers
and “various tax increases.”

The whole thing sounds pret-
ty rosy, until you wonder how
it would be possible to say that
much money when you have spe-
ciﬁcally exempted over 800,000
seniors in Florida alone. Some-
thing isn’t adding up.

Some more moderate Demo-
crats are unsure about many of
the proposed components of this
overhaul, not least of all the ban-
ning of illegal immigrants from
purchasing private insurance and
loosening federal restrictions on
the funding of abortions.

Several Dems are not-too-
slowly backing away from this
ever-growing monstrosity. For
Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D., IL), he
says he can no longer stand by
the ObamaCare reform. He was
quoted last Friday on the subject
saying, “If we bar the immigrant
community from buying private
insurance with their own money,

we relegate them to emergency-
room care at the highest cost to
taxpayers” (WSJ, 3/13). Interest-
ingly enough, he initially voted
for the House version of health-
care reform last year.

True to form, Pelosi is charg-
ing on with her vote-scrounging
treasure hunt—continuing to ig-
nore the pleas from her own par-
ty to slow down and negotiate. It
was reported that Ms. Pelosi just
gave up on around a dozen mod-
erate pro-life Democrats led by
Rep. Bart Stupak (D., MI).

This move is a risky gamble,
considering how she is quickly
running out of people to ignore.
She might want to get started on
the 37 House Democrats who
voted NO on last year’s health-
care bill. I can only imagine the
kind of pork they’ll need to be
convinced.

Many in Washington seem
convinced that this vote will
pass. Senior White House Advi-
sor David Axelrod, Obama and
Press Secretary Robert Gibbs are

all convinced this vote will go
their way.

But they aren’t voting on the
bill, and several other factors in
play might be enough to hold
back its passage. The GOP has
publicly urged a scrapping of
the entire bill and a bipartisan
restart. A seemingly reasonable
request, except that the GOP
knows that if they were to restart
the healthcare reform process,
nothing substantial would get
passed; exactly the position they
want to be in heading towards
the midterms.

The Democrats know it too,
and that’s why Pelosi has all but
ignored Boehner’s and Pence’s
bipartisan cries.

The Hispanic Caucus also
seems to have an issue or two
with some provisions in the cur-
rent Senate version. After meet-
ing with Obama last week, sev-
eral are still unconvinced that a
vote to constrain access to some
insurance to full citizens is the
morally just vote. The vast ma-

jority of the Hispanic Caucus is
still for the Senate version, but
every dissenting vote the nays
pick up will make it even more
difficult to ram this bill through
the House.

But wait, there’s more. This
week Senator Chris Dodd (D.,
CT) is expected to unveil his
tough new ﬁnancial regulation
bill. There must have been some
back room ﬁghting on this one,
as Dodd seems to be stealing
some of the momentum and po-
litical capital from fellow Demo-
crats in their moment of need.
His timing seems a bit odd; I can
only speculate that he wants to
leave some sort of legacy leg-
islation. His choice of ﬁnancial
regulation is a bit ironic, consid-
ering his past history with Coun-
trywide Financial. Perhaps his
bill contains special language for
preferential treatment of ﬁnance
ﬁrms that give cheap loans to ex-
Massachusetts Senators.

The noise from Washington
seems to be painting two very

different pictures. On one side,
the Democratic elite seem very
conﬁdent the bill will pass, with
Gibbs going so far as to say that
soon “it will be the law of the
land.” Other Democrats are not
so sure. While Rep. James Cly-
burn (D., SC) seems conﬁdent
that even though “we don’t have
the votes as of this morning...
[but] I am very conﬁdent that we
will get this done” (NBC, “Meet
the Press”), House Education
and Labor Committee Chairman
George Miller (D., CA), when
asked about the Democratic
votes, said “There’s a lot of work
to do” (WSJ, 3/13).

Even Patrick Caddell and
Douglas Schoen, both pollsters
for Presidents Carter and Clin-
ton, agree “the horse has left the
barn” (Washington Post, 3/12).

Who knows? Perhaps Eman-
uel can gently persuade some
dissenting Dems to change their
minds. When votes are for sale
like they are today, anything
seems possible.

Native American reservations are ignored and underfunded

After volunteering at an Indian reservation in high school,

By Barbara Knipp
C0 LU M NIST

My senior year of high school
we were instructed to organize a
senior project where we would
work as an intern at the place of
our choice.

I decided to visit an Indian
reservation and do volunteer
work there. After doing some re-
search online, I decided on doing
a program called Re-Member at
the Pine Ridge ‘Reservation in
South Dakota.

The program combined vol-
unteer work with education, as I

learned both how to build beds
and a lot about Native American
history. We would stay on the
site and build beds in the mom-
ing, and then go deliver them to
the homes of people in need.
Delivering beds and touring
the reservation, I was exposed
to the truth of the reservation.
The poverty level on the reserva-
tion is the worst that I had ever
seen. The majority of the popu-
lation on the reservation lived in
FEMA trailers that were falling
apart. Drug and alcohol abuse
were pervasive, gang graffiti

decorated most of the buildings
and stray dogs, called “res dogs,”
wandered the streets.

One of the most moving days
during my stay was one when
we delivered beds to a house in
a run-down residential neighbor-
hood. When we arrived there was
a dead dog lying in the street and
the house was in shambles.

Upon entering, we found all
of the rooms entirely bare except
for a dirty mattress on the ﬂoor,
one wall covered in family pho-
tographs, and one chair with an
elderly woman hooked up to a

breathing machine. We cleaned
the rooms and took the mattress
away, leaving in its place two
twin beds with sheets and com-
forters.

Located in the Badlands of
South Dakota, the Pine Ridge
Reservation held little promise
for a prosperous future. There is
an overall tone of hopelessness
that was evident in the bleak
landscape, run down homes and
shops, and symbols of gang vio-
lence.

The conditions of the Indian
Reservation were little known to

me. The fact that it is at a third-
world poverty level was com-
pletely surprising to me, as my
education up until that point had
never addressed more than the
“Trail of Tears” after European
colonization.

I was taught that Indians were
a thing of the past, but my trip
to the reservation showed that
was far from true. After listening
to several of the speakers on the
reservation, visiting sacred sites
and learning about Indian cul-
ture, I realized that despite the
bleak atmosphere and poverty,

Barbara Knipp ’s eyes were opened to domestic injustice

there was still a strong and proud
spirit and pride that ran through-
out parts of the reservation.

The trip really opened my
eyes to how I only know what I
am taught, and despite the good
education that I have been fortu-
nate enough to receive, I am still
ignorant to many interesting is-
sues in the world. I found it sad
how little people know about
Indians, considering they were a
major part of the development of
our country and their culture has
so much to offer.

Tweaking and perfecting drug discipline at W&L

While the current disciplinary system has had some success, the school can do more to condemn the real bad guys

By Stockton Bullitt
C 0 L U M N I S T

Drug use has become the new
sexual assault at Washington and
Lee: everyone is talking about it.

Recent high-proﬁle arrests
and publicity surrounding cer-
tain controversial SJC laws have
made the city of Lexington seem
like Miami, or at least Sigma Nu
in the ’80s. Drug-related arrests
and SJC hearings have skyrock-
eted.

But what does this really
mean? Is the administration re-
ally cleaning up drug use in Lex-
ington? Are the distributers like
Peter Martinez the primary ones
getting affected?

Well... kind of. Like any drug
initiative at any school, the re-
sults are relatively mixed.

Yes, the administration does
get its hands on the occasional
big-time dealer, but usually the
one big-name dealer comes in
tandem with a plethora of people
who were simply at the wrong
place at the wrong time.

I ﬁnd it hard tocritique the
administration and SJC for step-
ping up efforts to enforce drug
use. It’s a noble cause, but, like
most other disciplinary bodies,
they tend to lose sight of their
original goal and simply settle
for prosecuting whomever they
can get their hands on, so that
they can send a message to the
rest of the student body.

My problem with this strategy
is that too many dumb ﬁrst-years
who are dabbling into something
shouldn’t usually bear the brunt
of the discipline and suffer too
harsh a consequence as a result.

To alleviate this problem, I
have devised an alternative to
the current system of respond-
ing to drug use at W&L. I won’t
delude myself—or you, for that
matter—into thinking that this
idea will ever come to fruition,
mostly because it takes too much
work and discretion.

Yet I think it is the outlook
that the administration and SJC
should have when it comes to

drugs in Lexington.

First, let’s answer why there
is drug discipline at W&L in the
ﬁrst place. I believe that disci-
plining students for drug use
serves two purposes: “protecting
the students from harm they can
do to themselves, and protecting
fellow students from damages
that could come from another
student’s intoxication or by sell-
ing the drug to others.

trades work in pyramids: there
are a few suppliers at the top who
distribute to the dealers who then
sell marked—up product to regu-
lars and experimenters alike.

The school needs to treat each
of these four groups separately to
achieve its goal.

Let’s start with the ﬁrst group,
the experimenters. These kids

are made up of casual users, (i.e.~

twice a semester), people trying

I believe that disciplining students for

drug use serves two purposes.‘ protect-

ing the students from harm they can do

to themselves, and protecting fellow

students from damages that could come’

from another students intoxication or by

selling drugs to others. V
 

While W&L takes both these
problems seriously, the school is
much more concerned with the
second. If an intoxicated student
badly injures another, the school
is not in great shape. I get that.

So, in line with those prin-
ciples, the best plan for W&L to
take is to take out the supply and
to dissuade potential experiment-
ers from trying the speciﬁc drug.
This will produce the best results
because if everyone is afraid to
sell drugs and there are minimal
new users, then the trade at W&L
quickly evaporates.

The next issue is actually ﬁg-
uring out how we are going to
get rid of the main suppliers and
minimize the new users.

This can be done with disci-
plining the drug trade the same
way it actually happens—that
is, through a pyramidal scheme.
I don’t think I’m blowing any
minds when I say that drug

the drug for the ﬁrst time and
people who are simply the wrong
place at the wrong time.

This group is by far the most
likely to get caught since they
are not adept to using and hiding,
but they are also the most im-
pressionable and, therefore, the
most important to deal with. The
strategy to take with this group is
to scare the ever-loving crap out
of them and to get them to say
where they got the speciﬁc drug.

Scaring them shouldn’t be
too hard—yet the right methods
are never properly utilized. First,
Dean Dotson and the rest of the
disciplinary section of W&L
need to spend their efforts intim-
idating the hell out of these kids,
not simply educating them.

Most students at W&L have
had more drug talks than they can
remember and they know what
they are doing, but they still do it
because they are not sufﬁciently

Off-campus parties not safe

Washington and Lee needs to come to grips with reality
and start thinking about the students ’safety

By Abel Delgado
co LUM NIST

Throughout the better part of
the last four years, I have wit?
nessed Washington and Lee ad-
ministrators make mostly well-
guided decisions in trying to
improve the W&L environment
outside the classroom. While the
success of different initiatives
and events has varied, we can al-
ways tell the administration had
good intentions and the student
body’s interest in mind.

The growing push to move
more parties off campus has
me worried this is no longer the

case, however, and I fear school.

ofﬁcials do not see the current

but W&L is in no way the only
campus where the drinking age
is largely ignored.

Obviously, the W&L admin-
istration should not openly pro-
mote law-breaking. However,
when I was a freshman, I was
under the impression that if I
was at an on-campus party and
not being belligerent, what was
in my red cup did not matter to
the campus security or to any
other school ofﬁcial. This now
seems to be the case for only off-
campus problems. '

A slew of on-campus parties
have been shut down earlier than

A slew of on-campus parties have been

shut down earlier than is customary this

year Other parties have not been

approved to be held on campus.

1

and future consequences of their
decisions. '

Drinking is a part of the
culture at W&L. Anyone who
doesn’t accept that just does not
accept reality. This doesn’t mean
that we should accept the jerks
who act irresponsibly and use
“blacking-out” as an excuse, but
as long as W&L students act re-
sponsibly, their drinking should

. be solely their concern.

Granted, there’s a liability
problem since about half the stu-
dent body is under the absurd
legal drinking age, and about
the same half lives on campus,

is customary this year. Other
parties have not been approved
to be held on campus. Just last
week, on-campus parties during
the Johnson Scholars visit were
rejected.

It is beyond me why school
officials would attempt to hide
a common W&L occurrence, a
Wednesday party, from our pro-
spective students. Do they think
these students are not respon-
sible enough to make proper de-
cisions about partying now, but
will be in September?

If anything, we should expose
these students to everything the

W&L social scene has to offer. It
is better to ﬁnd out now whether
or not they can handle it, rather
than later.

Again, I understand this is a
legal liability issue in a country
where suing someone for your
own irresponsibility is all too

' common, but that doesn’t mean

we can hide reality. V

This past week, as they have
for most this year, W&L student
have predictably responded to

on-campus party hostility by_

moving nearly all their parties
away from campus. This means
the school has no liability, but
because of that decision, the
school is left without any control
of what happens.

What does this lead to? This
leads to students acting less re-
sponsibly, not more. This leads
to more students getting arrested
for plenty of things that students
wouldn’t dare to do openly on
campus, but are becoming com-
monplace off campus.

If the administrators achieve
their goal of pushing parties
off campus, they can expect
more students to get arrested for
drugs, drunk driving and for be-
ing drunk in public. Worse of all,
they can expect sexual assaults
to go up.

They can also expect many
students who go too far and need
a trip to the health center, not to
get one.

This reality is clearly not
what the administration, trustees

or parents want. Therefore, it’s

time for them to rethink their on-
campus party policies.

aware of the detrimental con-
sequences. This is where Dean
Dotson, who already does a great
job making students aware ofthe
consequences, can go further.

Look, I’ve met Dean Dotson.
He’s a really nice guy, but he is
alsojacked and has a deep voice.
Since he is so nice and under-
standing, he probably wouldn’t
go as far as bringing every single
one ofthe experimenters to tears,
but that’s what he and the SJC
should be doing. They should
view every dry check on these
kids’ faces as a failure.

I don’t say this because I want
water boarding allowed at W& L,
but if every student who leaves
an SJC hearing can only mutter,
“Well there’s no freaking way
I’m ever doing that drug again,”
then they have done theirjobs.

The point can be made even
further with parent involvement.
Instead of sending a letter, how
about calling the parents? What
student wouldn’t care if his or
her grandma called to talk about
why he or she thinks it’s cool to
smoke pot in a dormitory bath-
room? Families are by far the
best at scaring the shit out of
their kids. Why not utilize that?

However, besides scaring
the experimenters, I don’t re-
ally think much else needs to be
done in the form of punishment.
If the students then won’t do it
again, why make their lives too
difﬁcult?

On the hand, harsher punish-
ments can be doled out ifthe stu-
dent refuses to give information
about his or her source. Getting
names is critical with experi-
menters, because they will give
up the names.

But wait~W&L certainly is
not ﬁlled with narcs, and there
is no way anyone at W&L would
rat out a friend.

Well, that wasn’t supposed to
be the case in the real world, yet
it still seems to happen. So why
not use some of the provenly ef-

fective methods?

Students will be much more
likely to give a source if their
punishments are reduced. Why
not have different punishments
for people who give information

~ and for people who don’t? And

why not let the parents know if
their kids don’t feel like cooper-
ating? They’d love to hear that.

Also, if the students don’t
give correct information or don’t
feel like cooperating whatsoever,
there’s always the handy dandy
honor code to turn to. No matter
how you do it, some kind of evi-
dence ofa dealer should come out
of talking to an experimenter.

Now, on to the regular users.
For these offenders, the school
should probably be thinking
about getting the students to stop
harming themselves on a regular
basis—but once again, we’ve all
had plenty of education in our
lives. So how do you do it?

You take up their time. Repet-
itive drug use primarily evolves
out of free time, so to take away
the drug use, you take away the
free time. Assigning community
service or work orders is not
strange to Rockbridge County;
why should it be for W&L? I’m
sure that maintenance would love
a little help around campus.

Since the regulars have been
usingdrugs for a while, they will
most likely know who does what
within the pyramid, so getting
them to talk isjust as vital.

Working your way up the
pyramid, you get to drug dealers.
Now, here’s where I have a prob-
lem with the zero tolerance poli-
cy at W&L and other schools.

While most of the dealers on
campus should be reprimanded
for distribution, they do not
necessarily need to be expelled.
Most of them treasure being here
just as much as everyone else.

The key with this group is to
get them to prove their dedica-
tion to W&L. Put them so close
to expulsion that they feel its im-

pending pressure, but don’t au-
tomatically kick them‘ out. That
way, the people who want to
stay will still get a great educa-
tion, and those who don’t value
W&L will eventually get what’s
coming to them. Plus, those who
want to stay will become the best
allies, and W&L can at least say
they tried with the others.

The ultimate goal of dealing
with the bottom three groups
should be getting the last group.

Obtaining information about -
Lexington’s premier drug suppli-
ers should be the focus of every
hearing, interview or even casual
conversation with the ﬁrst three
groups.

You want to end any sem-
blance of drug culture in Lex-
ington? You get the engine to the
system: the suppliers.

LexPo hasn’t been afraid
to go after these guys, and I’m
guessing that they would love
information about them. If the
W&L discipline system produc-
es names, times and dates, I’m
guessing results will happen, and
LexPo might ﬁnally get around
to trusting students.

So, people responsible for
disciplining students at W&L,
what’s wrong with this plan?
Where are the loopholes?

From high school on, I have
seen way too many kids who
were stuck in the wrong place at
the wrong time get screwed by
systems that like to catch the lit-
tle guy—and use that to advertise
alleged results, rather than spend
the time and the effort catching
the big guys.

I know that W&L’s process
for stopping the drug trade is no-

, ticeably better than most institu-

tions, but that doesn’t mean the
system can’t still be improved..

I mean, you don’t necessar-
ily need to END IT. Just THINK
ABOUT IT.

ers) and END IT, a group that
came out of fall term’s Sexual
Assault Prevention Workshop,
revive the PostSecret campaign
armed with posters, T-shirts, and
new projects for Love Your Body
Week.

LYBW dedicates a week to
empowering women by high-
lighting prevalent issues women

\ face universally and speciﬁcally

at Washington and Lee.

The goal is to build momen-
tum and mobilize the community
around issues like sexual assault.

But controversy over last
year’s PostSecret campaign—a
project that involved W&L com-
munity members writing their
secrets on postcards—created a
roadblock this year.

KEWL President Catherine
Kruse, a junior, explained that

some members of the W&L
community felt the posts were
inappropriate and too visible.

END IT President Emily
Coyle, a senior, added that the
group didn’t expect PostSecret to
take the direction that it did.

Candid comments on the
postcards revealed that W&L stu-
dents deal with issues normally
considered too taboo to discuss,
such as the hookup culture, body
image and sexuality.

“It was pretty illustrative of
how we actually are on campus,”
said Coyle.

The secrets were posted in the
John Elrod Commons stairwell
where people became concerned
over potential trafﬁc hazards,
as many community members
would gather at all hours of the
day to read the dozens of shock-
ingly truthful postcards.

This year’s PostSecrets are
restricted to the Commons Liv-
ing Room because students can
speciﬁcally reserve that space.

There will be tables in the
Commons for students to write
their anonymous confessions
and slip them in boxes to be dis-

played together later.

Last year’s PostSecrets were
displayed this fall in a niche on
the main ﬂoor of Leybum Li-
brary.

In addition to the PostSecret
campaign, KEWL and END IT
will start the Clothes Line Proj-
ect, an effort that usually high-
lights domestic violence but will
this year be devoted to sexual
assault.

about the prevalence of the issue
on campus. '

KEWL and END IT are co-

rizon and Women for Women

organization dedicated to reduc-
ing domestic, dating and sexual
violence in the Rockbridge area.

New tunes roundup

Washington and Lee ’s only radio station

shares sweet music from the studio

By WLUR Staff
STAFF WRITERS

Some of our staffers give you
some suggestions for tunes to
help you spring into spring:

Joanna Newsom

Have One On Me (Drag City)

Leading up to its release, much
talk about Joanna Newsom’s third
album, Have One On Me, focused
on its spectacular length—this
whole three-album ensemble
clocks in at over two hours. As it
turns out, that’s a lot of music, so
it’s tough to succinctly articulate
some commentary on my diges-
tion of it so far. I think that despite
Have One On Me’s epic length,
Newsom’s previous record Ys is
a more epic album. How can you
get more vast than all that harp
and those dense, sweeping swing
arrangements? J oanna’s totally in-
sane voice? Everything all knotty
and delicate? I say that not to fault
Have One On Me in any way, but
to draw attention to how different
its palette is: brass, woodwinds,
acoustic guitar, banjo and man-
dolin. The whole thing is so ma-
ture, so womanly, so American,
so thoughtful and precise. Add
to that Joanna’s voice—which
is now, somehow, all warm like
milk and honey—and it’s no sur-
prise that the album brought me
to tears in a couple of places.

A good entry point for some-
one less mushy over her is “Good
Intentions Paving Company,” a
fun driving song. My other fa-
vorites are the more “epic” ones:
“Easy,” “Soft As Chalk” and “On
A Good Day.” '

Frightened Rabbit
The Winter of Mixed Drinks
(FatCat)

There’s a certain class of rock
that I think of as “grown up,”
something about the vocals and
stylings. This category includes
groups like The Hold Steady, Cal-
ifone and The National. I think
Frightened Rabbit ﬁts in there as
well. The earnest, thoughtful, en-
ergetic and polished rock of The
Winter of Mixed Drinks will like-
ly attract a wide variety of fans.
(And that’s not even to mention
its catchy pop appeal.)

AAM, the group’s promoter,
tells us: “Glasgow-based Fright-
ened Rabbit are releasing their
third LP to towering expecta-
tions... Written during singer/
songwriter Scott Hutchinson’s

self-imposed exile to the seclud-
ed seaside hamlet Crail on Scot- .
land’s Fife coastline, The Winter
of Mixed Drinks is speckled with
nautical metaphor and imbued

with themes of human isolation,
resilience and the moumful tri-
umph of mortality. Though its
subject matter often skews to-
wards the dark, redemption—in
the form of a joyful choral burst,
chiming guitar line, or orchestral
swell—is never far away.”

Find redemption with “The
Wrestle” or “Living in Color.”

Ted Leo & the Pharmacists
The Brutalist Bricks
(Matador)

Ted Leo is now on Matador Re-
cords, becoming thesecond indie
powerhouse to sign to the venera-
ble imprint—see Pavement, Yo La
Tengo, Belle & Sebastian and The
New Pornographers on the active

rosterwin recent months. (Oh,'

and Sonic Youth put out its ﬁrst
Matador album, The Eternal, last
year.) The expectations are high
for anything that Leo touches, but
it’s hard to imagine making a bet-
ter debut on one’s new label than
The Brutalist Bricks, his strongest
effort since the 2001/2003 com-
bo The Tyranny of Distance ‘and
Hearts of Oak. '

While a couple of tracks on
Leo’s previous LP, 2007’s Living
With the Living, might claim a
spot on Ted’s proverbial greatest
hits album, the record as a whole
was disappointing. Luckily, The
Brutalist Bricks does almost ev-
erything right that Living got
wrong. If you’re not roped in by
the ﬁrst 15 seconds of opener “The
Mighty Sparrow,” then you’re
clearly in the wrong genre. There
are many more gems throughout,
from the aggressively melodic
“Bottled in Cork” to the thunder-
ing “Where Was My Brain?” to
lead single “Even Heroes Have
to Die.” Not that the other mate-
rial is ﬁller, either; throughout the
record, Leo showcases his ﬁne
songwriting, and the Pharmacists
(Chris Wilson on drums, James
Canty on guitar and keyboards
,and new member Marty Key on
bass) are in ﬁne‘ form. And what
can you say about Ted, but that
the dude can shred the guitar?
One of 20l0’s best.

focuses on teaching life skills to
women from third-world coun-
tries who have been victims of
war crimes.

Kruse explained that KEWL
has close ties with Project Hori-
zon because some W&L students
volunteer with the shelter or 24-
hour hotline now.

These organizations inﬂu-
enced KEWL’S poster campaign
for LYBW.

This year’s posters feature
facts about great things W&L
women are doing every day.

“It’s about celebrating
strength,” said Kruse.

KEWL is also bringing back
the foam cutouts of women from
last year, emphasizing all dif-
ferent body types and shapes,
adding focus to every aspect of
women.

Lastly, “indulgence day” asks
W&L women to forgo makeup,
wear comfortable sweats and
pick up free treats on Friday.

“We want women to feel
comfortable and conﬁdent so
that they realize they belong at
W&L,” said Kruse.

Coyle said she believes more
dialogue about women’s issues
like sexual assault need to take
place on campus.

“It was clear when packages
of reforms came through the

ISFHB Ad Hoc Committee that

an overhaul of the existing struc-
ture was necessary,” Coyle said.
But despite successes, some

people still criticize the LYBW
campaign.

“Some feel that the way
we emphasize women’s issues
brings men down,” said sopho-
more END IT member Lule
Rault, “but it’s about bringing
women up.”

Kruse reiterated that it’s .not
an either-or situation, although
there is an evident gender dis-
connect.

“Many blame the Greek sys-
tem for the lack of communica-
tion [between genders], but these
problems would still exist with-
out it,” said Rault. “We’re just
trying to alleviate some of that
aggression.”

96 teams: Madness or insanity?

Columnist Adam Cancryn analyzes the NCAA is proposal to expand its tournament from 64 to 96 teams

By Adam Cancryn
COLUMNIST

March Madness is certainly in full
swing, but not where you might expect it.
While 64 teams prepare to take the court
in pursuit of a national championship,
the NCAA is busy chasing its own holy
grail, one that could radically change the
way we view the Tournament.

In early February, officials began
exploring the possibility of expanding
the NCAA Tournament from 64 to 96
teams. The most likely scenario would
involve absorbing the NIT, adding more
host locations and granting the No. 1
seeds ﬁrst-round byes.

The NCAA argues that doing this
would give mid-majors a better chance
to make the tourney. In addition, it would
increase the percentage of overall teams
that qualify to levels on par with other
collegiate sports. In the current format,
just 19 percent of basketball teams is se-
lected for the NCAA Tournament. That
is lower than Division I baseball (21
percent), soccer (24 percent) and all of
the major pro sports.

Yet while these reasons might sound
valid on the surface, they are seriously
ﬂawed.

Based on N1Tology.com’s March 11
projections, 11 of the 32 NIT qualiﬁers
this year will come from the six power
conferences. Add that to the eight auto-
bids given to conference champions,
and there are just 13 slots available to
lesser—known teams. And that is pro-
vided every power conference team on
the NCAA Tournament bubble is chosen
and not knocked down to the NIT.

Were the NIT added onto the NCAA
Tournament, the result would be a ﬁeld
that might, at the most, include a few
second- and third-place ﬁnishers in
strong mid-major conferences. The rest
of the additional slots would go to power
conference teams. Simple expansion is
certainly not enough to balance out such
ingrained conference domination.

Besides, all that assumes that admit-
ting these extra teams is good for the
tourney’s general health. The NCAA

Tournament is typically viewed as a des-
tination for collegiate basketball’s elite,
a goal to work toward and earn through
solid conference play and an impressive
overall record. In the past two years,
just 50 of the combined I28 tournament
teams qualiﬁed with 10+ regular season
losses. Half of those were only eligible
because they won their respective con-
ference tournament.

Expanding the ﬁeld would signiﬁ-
cantly increase the number of double-
digit loss teams. In the best case, the
result would be a sizable talent gap be-
tween the elite and the mediocre teams.
This would emerge early, the favorites
would advance, and we would end up
with Sweet 16s and Elite 8s no different
than if it were a 64-team bracket.

The worst case is this year. There are
no top-ﬂight teams, leaving us with a
bottom-heavy ﬁeld full of schools that
normally would not enter tournament
discussion. Were this year’s bracket to
permit 96 teams, NC State (18-14, 5-11

in the ACC), North Carolina (16-16, 5-
11 in the ACC) and UConn(l7-15, 7-11
in the Big East) would all likely qualify.
Not only would mid-majors still be left
out, but the bracket would also be satu-
rated with underachieving, undeserving
power conference teams.

Yet despite the negative effect ex-
pansion would have on the tournament’s
competitive balance and prestige, there
is a good chance this change could occur
within the year.

The NCAA’s l 1-year, $6 billion tele-
vision contract with CBS carries an opt-
out clause available at the end of this
season. Conveniently, the NCAA’s deal
with the NIT also expires this year. In
anticipation of both, CBS and Turner
Sports are discussing a joint-bid for a
new contract. ESPN is also reportedly
prepared to make a play for tourney TV
rights.

Expanding to a 96-team ﬁeld would
not just push bidding to record highs.
It would also provide the winning cor-

poration with a chance to re-brand the
tournament.

Furthermore, from a ground-level
ticket sales standpoint, the math is sim-
ple: more games equals more host loca-
tions equals more paying fans equals
more income.

And that is how the NCAA has come
to see its end-of-year championship
games: numbers on a sheet that all add
up to huge proﬁts.

Never mind the physical and psycho-
logical toll it might take on the student-
athletes that spend a month absent from
school while traveling the country, play-
ing more games than ever before.

Never mind the overload of ultimate-
ly meaningless opening round games or
the fact that expansion ﬁxes none of the
current competitive balance issues that
continue to exist.

There are proﬁts to be made. To ig-
nore that would be madness.

Baseball continues roller coaster

The Generals fell to Eastern Mennonite, 1 0-2, but knocked off Greensboro, 11-4, to go 1-1 over the week

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

It was another up and down week for
the Washington and Lee baseball team
as they lost to Eastern Mennonite Uni-
versity, 10-2, but defeated Greensboro
College, 11-4. The Generals can hit and
pitch with the best of them, but finding
consistency has been an issue.

The results of their games since
March 3 read like this: win, loss, win ,
loss, win. The team is brimming with
talent, but it cannot yet ﬁnd that missing
piece needed to string together a couple
of wins. Right now, W&L’s record stands
at 3-6 with a 1-2 conference record.

On Tuesday, W&L traveled to Har-
risonburg to face off with James Madi-
son. Senior pitcher Nate Adkins got the
start for the Generals and struck out the
side in the ﬁrst, but took the loss after
only one inning of work. The Royals

tagged him for six runs in the ﬁrst in-
ning, thanks to two run doubles by Cody
Davis and Dylan Smith.

The situation did not get any better
for W&L. Royals pitcher Jason Tate
shut down the Generals offensively.
Tate tossed a complete game and surren-
dered only seven hits to the potent W&L
lineup.

First-year catcher Luke Deary and
senior ﬁrst baseman Hunter Serenbetz
each knocked in a run off Tate, but the
Generals couldn’t set up an extended
rally. As soon as the ﬁnal out was made
in the top of the ninth, it was clear this
was a contest the Generals would rather
forget.

Two days later, the team looked to
rebound with a home match-up against
Greensboro College. The scripts were

The Generals are now 4-2, and 2-0 in ODAC
conference play after recent wins over Sweet
Briar and Mary Washington

By Lizz Dye
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee women’s
lacrosse team improved to 4-2 with a 21-
1 Victory over Sweet Briar College and
a 16-10 win over No. 16 Mary Washing-
ton.

The Generals traveled to Sweet Briar
College on Tuesday, coming off a 16-8
loss versus Franklin and Marshall. But
the Generals showed no signs of weak-
ness against Sweet Briar. Nine different
W&L players scored in the ﬁrst half en
route to a crushing 21-1 victory.

Senior attack Britten Mathews and
junior midﬁelder Emmy Mathews set
the tone for the rest of the game by scor-
ing back-to-back goals before even ﬁve
minutes of playing time had passed.

Sweet Briar followed with a goal of
its own, but it was the only net action
the team would see for the remainder of
the contest.

Sophomore goalie Jen Linder played
30 minutes in goal, putting up one save
versus one allowed goal. F irst-year goal-
ie Alex Hamill ﬁlled in for the other 30
minutes and did not face one shot.

Emmy Mathews scored three goals
to lead the Generals. Seven Generals
earned added two individual goals for
W&L: senior attack Meredith Free-
man, sophomore midﬁelder Christina
Benedetti, sophomore midﬁelder Alexis
Harrison, ﬁrst-year midﬁelder Ashley
Barnes, sophomore attack Alli Shea-
rin, ﬁrst-year attack Elizabeth Buck-
lee and ﬁrst-year attack Mary Jennings
VanSant.

Britten Mathews, junior midﬁelder

Kate Donnelly, sophomore attack Mad-
die McKaig and junior attack Ellie Van
Sant each scored one goal.

On Saturday, the Generals faced No.
17 Mary Washington and came out on
top with a decisive 16-10 victory. The
Generals were led by Emmy Mathews
again, who recorded four goals and two
assists.

Junior attack Wilton Megargel put up
three goals and two assists in the victory,
earning all ofher goals in a crucial pull-
away for the Generals.

The game was close with the Gener-
als leading 9-8 with about 22 minutes
remaining. Megargel scored three of the
subsequent six unanswered goals, which
led to the Generals’ victory. Mathews
added two goals during the 6-0 run.

Junior goalie Katharine F arrar played
the entire game for the Generals, record-
ing 11 saves versus 10 allowed goals.

“It was an exciting win and we
showed exactly what our team can do
when faced with a challenge,” Bene-
detti said. “We came out on top, and I’m
excited to see what else we can accom-
plish.”

The Generals play No. 15 Cortland
State at home at 4:30 p.m. this Wednes-
day.

ﬂipped in this one as W&L raced to a
quick 6-0 lead over the ﬁrst two innings
and eventually ran the ﬁnal score to ll-
4.

RBI singles by ﬁrst-year catcher Will
Salley and Serenbetz, in addition to a
two-run double by senior third baseman
Jim Plantholdt, sparked the ﬁrst inning
outburst. Michael Manfro had been
pitching very well for the Pride this
year, but the Generals were all over ev-
erything he hurled toward home plate.

Senior catcher Will Lewis was given
the day off behind the plate, but still
went 3-4 with two doubles, two runs,
and two RBl’s in the designated hitter
slot. Plantholdt ﬁnished with two hits
and three RBIs.

Senior second baseman John Ditore,
recently crowned ODAC player of the

week, bumped his sparkling average
to .487 with three more hits. He is the
team leader in hits, runs, doubles, aver-
age, slugging percentage, and any other
positive hitting statistic one could think
of. His walk-up song is “S on my chest”
and this is an apt description of his Su-
perman-esque start to the season.

Sophomore pitcher Jody Davis start-
ed and picked up the win for W&L. He
went six innings, scattered ﬁve hits and
struck out three.

Coaches love to see pitchers attack
the strike zone, and Davis did just that.
He worked the comers and set up his
off-speed pitches to perfection, result-
ing in many poor swings for Greens-
boro batters. Over Davis’s six innings
of work, he faced very little stress; GC
would simply pop up or roll over pitches

and kill any potential rally.

W&L has the opportunity to climb
their way back to the top of the ODAC
with a busy week ahead of them. Start-
ing on Wednesday against Stevenson
University,'the team plays seven games
in eight days. This includes two double-
headers against ODAC rivals Guilford
College and Emory & Henry College.
The game on March 17 is at home, with
the ﬁrst pitch scheduled for 3 p.m.

The Battling Bishops responded with
some transition goals from broken plays,
but by the end of the first halfthe Gener-
als held a 4-2 lead over OWU. At the half
the Generals had outshot OWU 22-14 and
had shown great poise on defense.

First-year defender Joe LaSala had
two groundballs and caused three turn-
overs. LaSala plays big and physical, and
is one ofmany ﬁrst-year players who have
already made a great impact on the pro-
gram.

Senior captain Tyler Smith also an-
chored down the defense with three
groundballs and two forced turnovers.
While senior goalie Matt Mason had only
ﬁve saves, they were ﬁve saves that really
counted.

Each save came at a critical time when
OWU was trying to climb out from behind
the Generals. Mason made some enor-
mous one-on-one saves on the doorstep of
the goal, and refused the Battling Bishops
any easy goals.

In his ﬁrst year as starting goalie, Ma-
son has stepped up to the plate and shown
great heart, skill, consistency and poise as
a leader on this team.

Also worth noting is ﬁrst-year transi-
tional midﬁelder Cooper Brown, who re-

als didn’t let themselves be ﬂustered and
they knocked off their first ranked team of
the 2010 campaign.

The Generals returned to play on Sat-
urday at Franklin and Marshall. The Gen-
erals hung with the Diplomats, but they
simply couldn’t overcome three early
F&M goals.

W&L didn’t score until the 8:40 mark
in the first period when senior midﬁelder
Kevin Feeriey netted the Generals ﬁrst
goal. That was the only scoring the Gener-
als would see in the second half. The Dip-
lomats lead 4-l heading into the locker
room.

The Generals tried to rally in the sec-
ond halfwith goals from senior midﬁeld-
er Logan Bartlett, Mancuso, Brown and
Means. But it just wasn’t enough to knock
off the Diplomats.

Mason recorded eight saves to counter
his seven goals allowed in the loss.

The Generals will next take on Virgin-
ia Wesleyan University at home on Satur-
day. Game time is set for 1 p.m.

posted an unassisted goal. The goal set
the score at 4-3. This would be the closest
the Battling Bishops would come to tying
the Generals. After a pair of unanswered
goals, W&L took a 6-3 lead.

At the end of 60 minutes of play, three
more goals gave the Generals a 9-5 vic-
tory. W&L outshot OWU 38-27 and capi-

Forced break-

in at Palace
Students robbed of $4, 000

worth of electronics

By Chelsea Stevenson
STAFF WRITER

An off-campus student house, “Pink Palace,” was
robbed of nearly $4,000 worth of electronics last
weekend when its occupants, three Washington and
Lee juniors, were away at their fraternity formal.

Sometime between 4:30 pm. on Saturday, March
13 and 4:00 a.m. on Sunday, March 14, a forced

. break-in occurred at the 2851 Collierstown Road
residence. All of the house’s occupants had departed
that Saturday afternoon for the Phi Delta Theta fonnal.
Prior to their departure, the students locked their house,
according to house occupant Wit Robertson.

Aﬁer the formal, resident Andy Merlino returned to
the house around 4:00 a.m. and didn’t notice anything
suspicious, because he immediately went to bed. The
following day, Robertson, who had spent the night in
town, received a phone call from Merlino who said
the house had been severely robbed.

Robertson and Jason Cimino, the house’s third
occupant, returned to the house immediately and

“Things like this happen in the
world every day, and we ‘re
hoping we can bring these thieves

to justice. ”

JASON CIMINO, junior
 

noticed a muddy footprint on the lower half of their
front door, indicating that the break-in was forced.
The students reported the following missing items
from their one—story home: two televisions, a laptop,
a desktop computer, two jackets, an internet router, a
wireless cell tower, two X-Box Consoles, four X-Box
controllers, and several DVDS and video games.

Robertson reported that his dresser drawers had
been pulled out and his clothes covered his floor. The
robber had also broken a golf club and the binding of
R0bertson’s snowboard during the ravage.

Since the break-in, the W&L students have been
in contact with the Rockbridge County Sheriff’s
Department, where officers are still investigating
who is responsible for the forced entry. The students
provided several serial numbers for their missing
items, with the hopes of seeing their goods again
someday at a registered pawn shop.

According to Robertson, the students have never
had any reported problems with their surrounding
neighbors. The only incident was last fall, when the
current occupants received a letter from a student and
the principal from Effinger Elementary School, located
just north of the house. The school was frustrated that
the Pink Palace inhabitants had left trash in their yard
for more than a single day. Beyond the good relations
that the students have with their neighbors, the students
are also communicative with their landlord, Charlie
Potter.

Potter has been the landlord for Pink Palace and
three other country homes inhabited by W&L students
since 1990: “Lazy River,” “the Mill” and “Cedar
Creek.” Immediately following the incident, Potter
changed the locks and provided the residents with new
keys at all four of the homes.

According to Robertson, other W&L students who
live off campus, especially in the country, should lock
their doors and windows while sleeping or are away
from their house. For months now the “Pink Palace”
occupants have gone to great extents to conserve
power by turning their lights off when possible. Now,
however, the students will make a conscious effort to
always keep a light on.

Potter said that in his nearly 21 years as landlord,
nothing like this has ever happened in his homes
before, but he associates this incident with today’s
tight economic times.

“I think it was just luck probably, since times are
uncertain and people are out of jobs,” said Potter.

He also cautioned students to be wary, no matter
where they live. “It can happen in the city just as well
as in the country.”

Although frustrated and dismayed by the forced
entry, Cimino agreed with Potter. “Things like this
happen in the world every day, and we’re hoping we
can bring these thieves to justice,” he said.

To get to W&L! EC hopes to bring Chick-ﬁl-A to campus as a new dining option

A By Paige Gance

STAFF WRITER

The Executive Committee has
been working to bring Chick-Fil-A
to campus since the beginning of fall
term, and students might be able to
“Eat mor chikin” by the end of this
year

The plan is not a sure thing, and
the EC plans to release a survey in the
next few weeks in order to measure
student preference.

Ultimately, said Eric Hoffman, EC
president, it comes down to “what the
students want.”

The idea to bring in the restaurant
first came to the EC when a friend at
the University ofNort_h Carolina told
Hoffman about how the fast food
chain comes in once a week to cook
and serve chicken sandwiches to UNC
students.

Given the lack of an affordable
variety of restaurants in town and
limited dining options on campus,
Hoffman said he feels this would be a
welcome addition to the current meal
selection.

The restaurant originated in the
South but has since spread nationwide.
Some W&L students like it so much
they drive all the way to Roanoke
for a meal.

Since the Roanoke establishment is
the closest one to Lexington, the EC,
along with the director of auxiliary
services, Alex de Silva, have worked
with that restaurant extensively on
this project.

Chick-ﬁl-A representatives have

already come and inspected the
cooking facilities on campus and
determined that, without additional
equipment, the food cannot be
prepared in the Marketplace or C0-
op. The idea of transporting the food
to campus from Roanoke was deemed
unsuitable due to the narrow window
of time that the food would still be
ﬁt to eat.

Currently, the plan would be to
prepare the food in Evans Dining Hall
and then serve it in places like the Co-
op and Law School Brief Stop. Chick-

If Chick-fil-A does come to
campus and if it is successful, there
could be a permanent establishment
on or near campus, although available
space is an issue. At the moment, the
university’s focus is on opening the
Hillel bagel shop.

Such future projections might
be “premature” at this point, said
de Silva, who is in charge of dining
services.

“There is a common commitment
to evaluate the possible options of
introducing a ‘brand’ within the

“[Chick-ﬁl-A] would encourage people to eat

on campus instead of the sorority or fraternity

houses. ”

ERIC HOFFMAN, EC president

ﬁl-A, however, would have to provide
addition equipment in order to adhere
to its strict preparation standards.

There are still “lots of hurdles,”
said Hoffman, but he said he is
“optimistic” about the chances of
Chick-ﬁl-A coming to campus.

He also said he would like to see
it served “at least once a semester.”
Ideally, it would be served every
month or even every week.

mix of existing dining venues,” said
de Silva. The results of the student
survey will “certify the campus desire
towards this brand or point us in a
different direction.”

Scott Centorino, current EC vice
president and a candidate for EC
president, is conﬁdent about bringing
in Chick-ﬁl-A.

One of the ten commitments he
says he will pursue if elected states,

‘‘I will work to ﬁnish this EC’s goal
of bringing Chick-ﬁl-A to campus,
which is within reach.”

Along with tasty food and more
variety, current EC president Hoﬁinan
said he believes Chick-ﬁl-A could
beneﬁt the student body in certain
indirect ways.

Besides being “one of the healthiest
fast food restaurants,” its popularity
could increase the appeal of W&L
from an admissions standpoint, he
said.

Furthermore, its presence “would
encourage people to eat on campus
instead of the sorority or fraternity
houses," said Hoffman. One of the
EC’s aims has been to promote more
interaction between all members of
the student community.

While the details of the plan are
subject to change, Chick-ﬁl-A is still
interested in the idea as of now, but
this is not set in stone either.

If the plan is implemented,
Hoffman said the cost of a meal
will probably be covered by food
ﬁex. Now don’t you wish you hadn’t
used up all your funds on Sunrise
sandwiches?

Group will SPEAK up  

Sexual assault awareness group to sponsor a week-long campaign of education

By Killeen King
STAFF WRITER

SPEAK will be sponsoring their
new initiative SPEAK Week next
week in an effort to bring the entire
campus into their ﬁght against sexual
assault.

SPEAK is an organization that
educates women about sexual assault
on campus, supports survivors of
sexual assault and empowers women
to rally against sexual assault on
campus, according to SPEAK’s
president Taylor Hart. It hopes to
promote discussion of sexual assault
through the events of SPEAK Week.

“SPEAK Week will have a
diverse array of events and initiatives
that should help members of our
community look at the issue of sexual
assault from different perspectives,”
said Hart.

These events include: the Snap!
Bracelet campaign, a sexual assault
forum, a performance by the group
Sex Signals, the Take Back the Night
Rally and Denim Day.

This is the fourth year that
SPEAK has done the Snap! Bracelet
campaign, but this year it is taking a
new approach, according to Hart. “We
wanted to make this campaign more
gender-neutral, because it is critical
that the entire campus get involved
Ait cannot simply be a women’s

issue,” said Hart. The bracelets say,
“I support W&L women” and will
be available various places around
campus, including the Commons and
the library.

Two Washington and Lee staff
members will moderate the sexual
assault forum and there will be a
six-to-eight person panel consisting

much denim as possible, in light ofa
court case in which ajudge told a rape
victim that she could not have been
raped~due to the fact that herjeans
were too tight to remove,” said Hart.
The week will end on Thursday,
April 1 with the Take Back the Night
Rally, which is headed by senior
SPEAK member Katie Sinks.

“It is critical that the entire campus get

of both men and women, Hart said.
SPEAK will place boxes around
campus for people to submit panel
discussion questions and topics.

Sex Signals, which is sponsored
by SPEAK, Contact, 1-in-4, IFC,
Panhellenic and several fraternities,
will perform on Wednesday. This
interactive series is meant to engage
the audience in sexual assault
discussions said Hart.

For Denim Day, SPEAK
encourages students to “wear as

“It is a rally, but in my opinion [it
is] more ofa vigil that allows people
to share their stories and thoughts
on sexual assault and misconduct,”
explained Sinks. “I think it can be a
profound and sobering experience.”

Each year, a sexual assault victim
gives an account of her experience at
the rally. Each year brings in more
attendees than the last, and SPEAK
members hope that this year will
continue the trend.

“I think the most empowering part

ofthe week is the fact that we will be
hosting such a variety of activities,”
Sinks said. Even by participating in
one singular event you are standing
up for and recognizing a worthwhile
cause.”

“its a very clever way ofbringing
the community together across a
series of events,” concluded Sinks.

SPEAK accepts new members
each year through an application
and interview process, which begins
during SPEAK Week. SPEAK
will have information about the
organization and applications at its
table in the Commons on Monday,
Mar. 29.

What should we do about Israel?

Should U.S. foreign policy continue to support Israel in its conquest of the West Bank? Jarrett Brotzman weighs in.

By Jarrett Brotzman
CO L U M N I ST

These past two weeks have
put great stress on the relation-
ship between lsrael and the Unit-
ed States.

Last week, the United States,
through the actions and words of
Vice President Biden. gave Israel
a sharp rebuke for its aggressive
expansion of settlements in the
West Bank.

According to the Financial
Times, Biden accused Israel of
“inflaming tensions“ in the re-
gion, and strongly urged Israel
not to prejudice the outcome of
the forthcoming peace talks be—
tween Palestine and Israel.

These new developments
between Israel and the US. are
interesting, considering that the
U.S. has traditionally shown un-
bounded support for Israel.

Since Israel became a country
after WWII, the United States
has provided the Israeli military
forces with weapons and train-
ing, and backed the country with
a strong showing of political
capital in various international
organizations.

Israel has been the largest
recipient of both economic and
military assistance out of any
nation in the world since 1947
(U.S. Foreign Aid to Israel, U.S.
CRS). Between 2001 and 2007
alone, the U.S. gave Israel al-
most $20 billion in foreign mili-
tary ﬁnancing.

In addition to providing mili-
tary goods to Israel, the United
States serves as the largest trad-
ing partner for Israeli goods and
services, accounting for a full
32.5 percent of exports. This
relationship is also highly ben-
eﬁcial for some industries in the
United States. Almost I2 percent
of Israeli imports from the U.S.
is comprised of military goods,
grain and consumer goods (CIA
World Factbook, 2009).

However, a ramping up of
political rhetoric by the Obama
administration, most recently by
Vice President Biden claiming
that “both sides will be held ac-
countable for any statements of
actions that inﬂame tension,” has
caused many to wonder ifthis re-

lationship is going to remain as
strong as it has in the past.

The implications of deteriora-
tion in any relationship, political
or economic, have vast implica-
tions in the international realm.
Israel has served as a strong mili-
tary partner in the region, and has

America’s relationship with Isra-
el throughout history. They fear
that this alliance give justiﬁca-
tion for other nations and groups

in policy.

acted as a counterweight to the
overwhelmingly Arab nations’
interests in the Middle East.

Perhaps a continued alliance
in its current form is no longer
in the best interests of the United
States.

Some groups have opposed

One signiﬁcant example to
which these critics point is the
U.S. “Operation Nickel Grass,”
a resupply mission to Israel dur-
ing the Yom Kippur War that led
to the 1973 oil embargo by the
Arab states in OPEC.

Critics also say that Israel’s

use of U.S. weapons in the 1982
and 2006 offensives against
Lebanon only serve to fuel anti-
American sentiment in the re-
gion.

The questions before the
Obama administration are
whether or the U.S. ‘should con-
tinue its military and economic
aid to Israel, and whether or not
any aid should come with spe-
ciﬁc stipulations on activities in
the West Bank and surrounding
regions.

Recent language from Vice
President Biden seems to indi-
cate that the current administra-
tion is considering a change in
policy.

Perhaps the recent change in
tone is an indication of future
policy. If one day the U.S. ceases
to support Israel as it does now,
two distinct—though not mutu-
ally exclusive—scenarios may
follow.

The ﬁrst is that many Arab
nations would tone down their
anti-American sentiment, and
there would be more room for

safe interaction with other Arab
states as we pull support from
Israel.

However, the U.S. would also
risk giving up signiﬁcant terri-
tory and influence in the Middle
East. A change in policy could
have the opposite effect, and fur-
ther encourage separatist groups,
who may claim their terrorist
techniques drove U.S. forces out
of the region.

Either way, the US. could
face a serious loss ofinﬂuence in
the region, regardless of what the
Obama administration chooses
to do.

Peace talks are always a good
start, but I feel that there will be
little concrete progress between
Israel and Palestine while we re-
main in the region.

Camping against the threats of nature

Thoughts on camping, global warming and, most importantly, bears

By Hal Bozarth
COLUMNIST

It’s nearly spring, and our
lovely Lexington weather is co-
operating with the calendar.

The sun is shining, the snow
is gone and the leaves are start-
ing to grow. Add our geography
and our community’s youth, and
this onset of the warmer months
can only mean one thing: Camp-
ing.

For most, it’s about living the
simple life, relaxing and getting
away from the pressures of the
modern world by zipping your-
self into a restrictive polythene
greenhouse full of farts and un-
washed feet. Yes, for many, it’s
about being at one with nature.
Well, not for me.

For me, camping is about be-
ing at war with nature. Shut it,
songbirds.

Be under no illusions: Mother
Nature is out to get you. As soon
as you’ve unpacked the Jeep, she
sends her minions: legions of
soldier ants, winged air support
from wasps the size of men’s
ﬁsts, badgers that can take your
leg clean off and the all-conquer-
ing, plan-ruining drizzle.

When I go camping, I like to
do it properly. Items not for me
include the self-erecting pop-up
tent, the inﬂatable mattress and
the down-feathered sleeping bag
with duvet. Those are for sis-
sies and the na'I've.vIt’s a jungle
out there, so I always pack the
essentials: blowtorch, machete
and enough bear traps to create a
half-mile perimeter.

It is said that the best way to
escape from a charging bear is to
take off your clothes, article by
article, and place them on the
ground. In theory, the bear will
stop to smell each item, giving
you a window through which to
escape.

The cost of running away
from the campsite naked is leav-
ing yourself defenseless, lost,
naked and, as a consequence of
your nakedness, alone. (Unless,
of course, you are a woman—in
which case your male compan-
ions will have thrown caution to
the wind in an attempt to keep

giving his grandchildren Lyme
disease.

News from the front is good,
though. The evidence is abun-
dant: we are winning this war
against nature. Greenpeace and
its ilk tell us that a chunk of
rainforest the size of Wales is
chopped down every day by a
joint-strike movement coordi-
nated between burger companies
and Nike, both in search of slave
labor driven by doe-eyed Aztec
children. (I thought the Spanish
killed them all off with guns and
syphilis?)

As a result of this deforesta-

Yes, for many, [camping is] about being

me, camping is about being at war with

nature. Shut it, songbirds.

you in their sights.) I disagree
with this advice: surely the best
way to avoid being eaten by
bears is to shoot them in the mid-
dle of the face.

Children bemoan the appar-
ent murder of Bambi’s mother.
Better she went out with a bang
than to have run headlong into a
speeding truck in an attempt to
cross the road and lick a salty
retiree to death while simultane-
ously destroying his patio and

tion, combined with our massive
automobiles running rampant
over the once-untamed frontiers
of North America, the globe is
warming.

If humankind loves one thing,
it’s warmth: for example, there
are millions more people living
in Egypt than in Sweden. The
deserts of Tijuana and Los Ange-
les are packed to the brim, while
chilly Alaska remains virtually
barren. Mexico and Brazil have

given us Tapas and the thong,
respectively. The Norwegians,
meanwhile, are given two op-
tions at birth: freeze to death or
kill yourself at age thirty—two.

If we do overdo the whole
warming bit, I’m not worried:
we here in Virginia canjust sit on
our mountains and laugh as the
guidos drown in the ever-sink-
ing Jersey Shore, and Washing-
ton, D.C., once again becomes a
swamp—not that Congress isn’t
already stuck in a quagmire.

For me, camping is about
coming face-to-face with the wild
beast that is the outdoors, blind-
ing it with tear gas, wrestling it
manfully to the forest ﬂoor and
then kicking it in the side with
steel-toed boots that were sent
halfway across the planet by a
massive Chinese barge.

We climbed our way out of
the primordial sludge to the top
of the tree, and now we’ve got
gadgets, baby. My GPS is so
powerful, I can see me looking at
me inside my tent. So look out:
here comes ol’ two-legs again
with his SUV that runs on pure
Agent Orange.

They say there’s a fine line
between camping and sleeping
rough on the floor. There is. It’s
called a guy rope, and mine is
made out of electriﬁed zin'c-gal-
vanized steel wire. So come on,
Mother Nature: here I am. It‘s
just you and me. Come and have
a go, if you think you’re man
enough.

Televison networks are streamling their program choices

Thanks to Fox News and MSNB C, over the past decade

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

A funny thing has been hap-
pening in network television
over the past couple of years.
Back in the old days, that is from
1997 to 2003~—were there even
networks before then‘? It doesn’t
matter——each network had its
own distinctive style and ﬂavor.
While watching a show, you
could tell from what network it
came.

Take “Boy Meets World” for
example; that show was manipu-
lated by ABC executives to bet-
ter ﬁt into their “TGIF” lineup
that was directed at the tweens
watching the show. The plot
lines were relatively simplistic
and the characters, especially
Cory’s parents and Mr. Feeney,
were reﬁned to reﬁect the pro-
posed values of the Disney Cor-
poration and its partners.

However, even though “Boy
Meets World” was as emblem-
atic of ABC in the late nine-
ties as “Dhanna and Greg,” the
show still could have survived
on another network. It would’ve
looked‘ different, yes, but not
drastically different.

These days, “Boy Meets
World” would never survive
anywhere else. The shows on
each network are getting increas-
ingly identical to each other. The
dramas on CBS are much more
like CBS sitcoms, instead of re-
sembling dramas on other net-
works. Network executives are
narrowing their focus to certain
demographics, and are less and
less likely to take any risks what-
soever when it comes to shows.

How did this start? Depend-

ing on your political afﬁliation,
you can thank either Fox News
or MSNBC. When Fox wanted
to start a news network in the
1990s, Newscorp chairman Ru-
pert Murdoch hired Republican
strategist Roger Ailes to start
and head the Fox News Channel.
Despite a slogan of being “Fair

, and Balanced,” the network un-

questionably has a Republican
slant to it. .

At the very least, the chan-
nel seems to have a streamlined
thought process when it analyzes
any news it encounters, which
led it to become by far the high-
est-watched news channel in the
United States. CNN, who vehe-
mently avoids any semblance of
opinion, was left in the dust.

Seeing this success, when MS-
NBC moved into 30 Rockefeller
Plaza in 2006, it decided to take
on a deﬁnitively liberal-sounding
point of view in response. While
it has not seen anywhere close
to the same viewership success
as Fox News, MSNBC still has
found better numbers with a sin-
gular, channel-driven outlook,
instead of simply presenting the
news.

Network executives saw the
success that a singular mindset
had for news channels, and ap-
plied it to their networks. They
found that by cemtering all
their primetime shows around
a certain idea or perception that
people have of themselves, they
could maximize their ratings and
proﬁts. By doing this, network
shows are now carefully crafted
to better resemble their net-

totheecilior

works’ respective ideals. Now,
obviously this has happened
in media since the beginning
of time, but since the advent of
Fox News and MSNBC, every
minute detail of each television
show has been manipulated to ﬁt
the program. And it’s been only
getting worse.

In 1999, Judd Apatow had a
show about high school fresh-
men green-lit by NBC. Then in

dience. I’m sure my professors
will appreciate my dedication to
such noble investigatory tech-
niques.

If you are a typical CBS
viewer, you are one of three de-
mographics that funnily enough
have a lot in common. You are

I either old, boring or without a

signiﬁcant interest in television.
The plotlines for CBS’ eve-
ning programming are conven-

The dramas on CBS are much more
like CBS sitcoms, instead of

ressembling dramas on other networks

 

2002, he had a show about col-
lege freshmen green-lit by Fox.
At the time, this was normal TV
business. Nowadays, this could
never happen. '

This is not necessarily an evil
invention. This trend is simply
either the further evolution of the
television industry or a fad that
will die out eventually. Either
way, it seems more natural than
either good or bad.

But who are these speciﬁc
demographics that each network
are trying to market towards?
And do you ﬁt into any of the
networks’ categories? Well,
luckily for you, I’ve completely
avoided homework altogether
this week just so I could get a
proper understanding of exactly
these networks think is their au-

tional and about as innovative
as Tiger’s choice in women to
sleep with. Shows like “How
I Met Your Mother” and “The
Big Bang Theory” started out
as original sitcoms that could
go in directions that TV had
never gone before. Instead, CBS
streamlined them into “Two and
a Half Men” look-a-likes that
lack any original character arcs
or plotlines. “The Mentalist” is
simply a conglomeration of dra-
mas that have repeated predict-
able outcomes. Why does CBS
do this? Because, as the leading
network in the US, its minimal
risk strategy appeals to the ma-
jority of Americans who watch
television so they don’t have to
think. It may not be interesting,
but it works.

Fox chose to go with a strategy
that puts as much action into one
network as possible. Whatever
kind of show you are watching
on Fox, there is the maximum of
it in that hour. Fox not only is the
league leader in explosions for a
network (think about “24” and
“Human Target”), but Fox also
keeps “American Idol” action-
packed with singer after singer
and tons of judges and guests.
Even with comedies like “Fam-
ily Guy” and “The Simpsons,”
there is nothing reserved about
the humor.'

Basically, everything Fox
does is shamelessly overt. I mean,
with the exception of looking up
an obscure disease on “House,”
have you ever had to Wikipedia
anything while watching Fox?

ABC has made the interest-
ing decision to give preference
to shows that only serve obses-
sive fan bases. They took the
exact opposite marketing strat-
egy from CBS. Instead of hav-
ing tons of non-interested view-
ers, ABC broadcasts programs
which are marketed towards the

fewer viewers who are intensely V

dedicated to their shows.

The network of obsession
has turned “Lost,” “Desperate
Housewives” and “Gray’s Anat-
omy” into cult phenomenons.
Look at “Lost.” There is not a
single person who could casu-
ally pick up “Lost” this season.
ABC has consciously marketed
a show that can only lose view-
ers from week to week and not
gain any. However, ABC knows
this and is hoping that everyone

networks have broadcasted less orginalprimetime shows

is talking about “Lost” the next
day, instead of “Two and a Half
Men.” ABC’s promotion of tele-
vision obsession is behind their
pickup of “Scrubs,” and their
development of “V” and “Flash
Forward.”

Lastly, if you are watching
NBC you want to feel intellectu-
ally superior to those around you.
If you watch NBC, you may or
may not be an intelligent person,
but the most important factor
in your television life is the se-
curity you feel from perceiving
yourself as smarter than the rest
of America. This strategy came
directly from MSNBC and more
speciﬁcally Keith Olberrnann,
who probably should’ve stuck
to “SportsCenter.” I fall into this
category, so I can speak about it
freely. NBC’s comedies all fo-
cus on smart, snarky characters
looking directly at the camera,
acknowledging the absurdity of
the situation, and somehow plac-
ing themselves above it. In other
words, this is the Paul Rudd net-
work. Even “The Marriage Ref”
follows the same kind of come-
dic plan.

So what should ,you take
away from these networks’ strat-
egies to ﬁt you into any of these
four categories? You could con-
scientiously acknowledge the
manipulation while still enjoying
the broadcasted shows, but that
takes a lot of effort. My advice:

‘ Screw it. Just watch cable.

‘The administration’ is not about policing students

Dean_ Watkins responds to opinion articles that criticize the school ’s administration for its party and drug philosophy

I write in response to the two
articles on the Opinion page of
the March 15 Ring-tum Phi,
“Tweaking and perfecting drug
discipline at W&L,” and “Off-
campus parties not safe.”

Both writers challenge “the
administration” to change stu-

\ dent conduct. Washington and

Lee has always prided itself on
the principle of student self-gov-
emance. Students are expected
to behave honorablyand to hold
their fellow students to this same
standard of conduct. When they
fail in ‘this, they are subject to
policies that govern student con-
duct.

But the University’s admin-
istration is not the police or the
FBI or the DEA. We are an edu-
cational institution; we are edu-
cators. Working with students,
we set standards consistent with

the mission of the institution
and ask students to live by those
standards.

No one is trying to hide
from reality. Quite the contrary,
the reality is that is that some-
times individual students make
individual choices when they
choose risky, often illegal be-
haviors—such as using illegal

drugs, engaging in sexual inter-

course without consent or driv-
ing while intoxicated. Students
need to reﬁect on their actions,
their peers’ actions, the values of
the University and what we can
all do to uphold those values—
individually as well as holding
peers accountable when they fall
short.

To suggest that the adminis-
tration has a goal of pushing par-
ties off campus could not be fur-
ther from the truth. At the same

that we are not the police and we
are not the criminal justice sys-

not be—to bring cases before the

goal is to reinforce an environ-
ment where our students are
making better choices, by re-

warding those who make the bet-

sometimes through removal from
the institution, who are not. And
our role never should be to wield
the Honor System as a sword.
Ultimately,'that undermines our
entire Honor System.

What we, as the “administra-

is for individual students to ac-

come with student self-gover-

While both writers are ‘criti-
cal of decisions made by some
of their peers (and should be
critical of such decision mak-

ing), what’s important to note is
that the majority of our students
make good choices. So, when
a W&L student knows another
student is NOT making the bet-
ter choice then, following a stu-
dent self-govemance model, he
or she should step in and help the
student who is struggling so it’s
not the EC or the SJC (or the po-
lice or the FBI or the DEA) who
has to address the poor decision-
making.

From my vantage point, I am

‘Spectacular, spectacular!’ FD ’1O

This weekend, students and staff will put on their gowns and tuxedos for Fancy Dress. The theme? “Moulin Rouge”

By Melissa Powell
STAFF WRITER

This weekend W&L students
will be celebrating a tradition that
began 103 years ago.

Fancy Dress Ball, an event
started by a university librarian
in 1907, has continued to provide
students with a classy, elegant and
fun evening.

And classy is exactly what
Fancy Dress Co-Chair Katie
Geddes wanted the ball to be
this year. After the dark and
serious theme of last year’s
event, Geddes said the committee
wanted something a little more
light-hearted. ‘

Moulin Rouge: the infamous
Parisian cabaret built in 1889 that
was the birthplace of the can-can
dance. It may be better known
as the 2001 film starring Nicole
Kidman and Ewan McGregor.
Either way, this year’s theme

draws on inspirations from the
recognizable windmill-shaped
Paris nightclub that is covered in
lights and draped with red satin.

Geddes said the Moulin Rouge
theme won by “light-years” when
the committee voted, and everyone
who has been involved is anxious
to see the results.

‘‘I’m really excited to see the
committee’s hard work combined
with our production company’s
lighting and effects,” Geddes said.
“The decorations are even better
than last year’s.” .

The selection process for the
theme started at the beginning
of the school year when students
interviewed for the committee.
Each interviewee was required
to list and describe three possible
themes. Geddes and Co-Chair
Kenneth Hopkins then compiled

all of the possible themes to
present to the students who were
picked to be on the committee.

The committee narrowed
the themes down to 10, then
to five. Committee members
formed groups to present on
each remaining theme, giving
PowerPoint presentations to
highlight possible ideas for
construction and decorations.
This year, Geddes and Hopkins
got the production company
Stage Sound to give feedback
on how feasible the ideas were
for each theme. Once the entire
committee voted, Moulin Rouge
won “hands-down,” according to
Geddes.

Committee members have
been sperlfding the last four
weeks in the Pavilion working
on construction and decorations

for the big night. And although
the majority of the work is already
ﬁnished, the committee still has to
move everything into the gym and
begin set-up.

The committee also had to
secure two musical performers
for the ball. This year’s band,
Trademark, will be performing
in the big gym. Trademark, a

i group from Richmond, is made

up of three vocalists and four
instrumentalists. It specializes in
Motown, contemporary, beach,
jazz and R&B music.

“We chose them because they
encompass all music,” Geddes
said. “This way, everyone has
something that they can dance
to.”

D] Ryan will be performing in
the small gym.

The FD committee received

$8,000 from the Executive
Committee this year, but $6,000
of it went to paying off debts from
last year’s ball. Geddes said the
committee will not go into debt
this year, and plans to keep the
budget under $70,000.

The committee gets most of
its budget from ticket sales, but
it also received donations from
the General Activities Board and
Mock Convention.

Fancy Dress will be held this
Saturday from 9 p.m. to l a.m.
in the Doremus Gymnasium. As
always, the event is black tie.

Tickets will be on sale all
week, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the
Elrod Commons and at the Law
School. A full package, which
includes two tickets, two T-shirts
and all of the memorabilia is
$140. Students can also purchase

a half package for $70, individual
tickets for $55 each, individual T-
shirts for $15 each or individual
memorabilia that ranges from $3
to $6.

The committee invested in
a new ticket system this year.
Each ticket is printed, a receipt
is e-mailed to the purchaser and
the ticket must be presented at
the door to be scanned. Tickets
may also be purchased at the door
for $55.

Invitations have been mailed
to all students, faculty and staff
that provides the date, location
and time of the event.

1-W&L debut of
‘Porgy and Bess’

American masterpiece comes to Keller

By Randi Wilson
STAFF WRITER

A 75th anniversary production
of Gershwin’s opera “Porgy and
Bess” is coming to Washington
and Lee tonight and tomorrow
night.

Theatre Director Rob Mish
calls this a “phenomenal”
opportunity.

“It’s a big deal,” he said.

The tour company, led by opera
impresario Michael Capasso,
is bringing two trailers full of
scenery, a 30-member cast, a
l5-piece orchestra and several
crewmembers to perform these
two shows in the Keller Theater,
Mish said.

A production as large as “Porgy
and Bess” is typically performed
at a 1,200 to 1,500-seat theater.
The Keller Theater can only hold
about 400 people.

Mish says that this promises
to be a “very intimate” and “rare”
experience for both thepeople of
Lexington and W&L. However,
Mish hopes that for “something
this important,” that W&L
students ﬁll most of the seats.

“Porgy and Bess” was the ﬁrst
American opera and is written
for and performed by an almost
entirely African—American cast,
as per George Gershwin’s original
dream.

Tim Gaylard, the professor
of music who is considered to
be W&L’s expert on everything
Gershwin, said he believes
Gershwin’s cast choice was very
much a political one.‘

Gershwin discovered the play
“Porgy,” adapted from the novel
by DuBose Heyward, in New
York in 1930, and was inspired to
create an opera from it. He moved
to a segregated African-American
community in Charleston, S.C.,
called a “gullah,” Gaylard said,
in order to research traditional
African music and life. Because
gullahs were segregated, they
were able to better preserve the
rhythms, music, spirituals and
dances in the African tradition.

It took two years to perfect
the authentic feel Gershwin was

looking for. While it still has a
Gershwin sound and a Broadway
quality to it, “Porgy and Bess”
remains distinctive from other
works like it. For instance, the
operatic version has all of the
dialogue sung in what is known
as a recitative style. But there is
a striking difference in that the
only characters that don’t sing are
whites with minor roles.

Gershwin refused to have
his opera sung by anyone other
than an all-black cast, Gaylard
said. While it was common in
the l930s to perform African
plays in the minstrel tradition,
where actors paint their faces
‘and bodies, Gershwin feared this
would stereotype the people he
was seeking to embody. lt was
for this reason that “Porgy and
Bess” was not premiered at the
Metropolitan Opera in New York
until 1985.

According to Mish, diversity
was “absolutely” a reason in
deciding to bring “Porgy and
Bess” to W&L.

But politics were by far not the
only reason.

Gershwin was very empathetic
in telling the “human story” of
“Porgy and Bess,” Gaylard said.
lt’s a touching, tragic tale about
a crippled beggar named Porgy
who falls in love with Bess, a
prostitute who is abused by her
former lover, Crown.

The music is also excellent.
Gaylard describes it as
“syncopated, energetic and‘
interesting,” like much of the
jazz music Gershwin has created.
It’s so technically diﬂicult that the
actors who play Porgy and Bess
will be different each night.

“Porgy and Bess” has been
sold out for a week, but for those
attending, enjoy what Gaylard
and many others have hailed as an
“American masterpiece.”

one dollar, I think we would have
considered it a success,” said
Kelli Jarrell, sophomore co-chair
for next week’s cook-off. “We
hope this year’s event will be even
more successful!”

In addition to ticket sales and
entry fees, Chi 0 plans to sell T-
shirts to further raise money for the
charity. The entire sorority, split
into four committees, has worked
to put together a successful event.
From decorations to marketing
and advertisements to T-shirt
designing and involving the

Lexington community,» all of
the sisters have made an effort
to help grant a sick child his or
her wish.

The Make-a-Wish Foundation
raises money to grant a “wish”
for children with life—threatening
diseases. A child’s wish can span
anything from trips to makeovers
to meeting celebrities. The
Foundation truly tries to give
the children whatever they desire
and provides a very personal
experience for each child. These
“wishes” are the bright spots

in their otherwise very difﬁcult
lives.

“This is important to Chi
Omega because Make-a-Wish is
enriching these children’s lives
and experiences and giving them
opportunities that they would
otherwise never have access to,”
Jarrell said.

Teams are encouraged to sign
up to compete for the title of “Best
Chili.” The judges will also award
a prize for the best table theme.
The event will feature several
student bands which will play in

-

30-minute sessions..

Those interested in competing
can enter the cook—off for a fee
of $50. Entrants may register as
a team, as well. Advance tickets
to the event, which are being sold
in the Commons for $3, guarantee
entrance and as much chili as you
can eat. Chi 0 will also sell tickets
at the door on Thursday for $5.
Donations are accepted as well.

Men’s

The Generals defeated Virginia Wesleyan

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

Rebounding from its only loss of the
season against Franklin & Marshall the
week before, the Washington and Lee
men’s lacrosse team kicked off confer-
ence play with a new winning streak.
Generals knocked off ODAC foe Vir-
ginia Wesleyan, 1 1-5, on Saturday to im-
prove to 7-1 overall and 1-0 in ODACS.

Facing off against F&M, the Gener-
als were unable to overcome four early
goals by the Diplomats. Down 2-] in the
ﬁrst quarter, another early deﬁcit loomed
over the Generals. But this time the
Generals weren’t the victims of strong
ﬁrst-quarter play. The Generals outshot
the Marlins 10-5 and quickly turned the
lead around with back-to-back goals by
junior attack Spencer Daw with assists

Heading into the second quarter,
the Generals lead 3-2 and never looked
back. Two more consecutive goals from
senior midﬁelder Logan Bartlett put the
Generals up 5-2. Assists went to Means
and Keigler.

The Marlins rebounded with a goal
of their own, but Bartlett was right there
to answer, recording his third goal of the
game off another assist from Keigler.

The third-quarter offense was all
W&L. W&L outshot the Marlins, 8-6,
and Means and Keigler each posted a
goal during the period to push the Gen-
erals ahead 8-3 and put the game away
for good.

Daw and Means led the Generals
with three goals and two assists each.
Keigler totaled one goal and ﬁve assists
and Bartlett had three nets and one as-
sist.

Senior goalie Matt Mason held strong
in the goal for the Generals, recording
seven saves versus ﬁve goals.

W&L will travel to Georgetown
University for another non-conference
match—up against No. 5—ranked Middle-
bury University on Tuesday. Game time
is set for 7 p.m.

losses going into a third set and one of
those going into a tie-breaker.

N.C. Wesleyan also brought “[a

bunch of] foreign players who all play
different styles than many people on the
team are used to,” Hall said.

No. 1 doubles team senior Alex
Brooke and sophomore Jonathan Gaff-
ney and No. 2 doubles team ﬁrst—year
Hayden White and sophomore Jeremy
Becht each pulled out victories in close
matches that ended with tie—breakers.
The lone singles victory of the day came
from No. l-seed White, who managed to
put his opponent away in two sets.

No. 2 singles player Becht and No.
5 Michael Freeman each took their op-
ponents to a third seed, with Becht push-
ing his opponent, Kale Nikunen, to the
limits with set scores of 4-6, 7-5, and 6-
7. Such close games make falling short
even more difﬁcult to handle, though
they do show just how good a team can
be, White said.

“Although the loss to NC Wesleyan
was extremely frustrating and disap-
pointing, the match gave us a good
barometer on how well we can do this
year,” said White.

The Generals now need to just focus
on putting their skills to good use and
turning those close matches into victo-
ries.

“We compete in every match we
play,” Davis said. “It’s just a matter of
getting everyone playing well at the
same time.”

The ﬁnal game of the week, played
last Friday afternoon, resulted in the
team’s ﬁrst conference loss of the sea-
son, and according to White, was “per-
haps the most frustrating” match of the

Busted NCAA brackets

A crazy opening weekend saw many top-rated teams knocked 0/7

By Adam Cancryn
COLUMNIST

What a weekend. Four days, 64 teams,
48 games and a number of shocking
upsets that left the power conferences
licking their wounds.

Wisconsin, No. 2-seeded Villanova
and, improbably, top-seeded Kansas
all fell to victim to mid-major upstarts,
a development that spelled doom for
brackets everywhere.

More importantly, however, the
weekend’s games demonstrated that
college basketball’s balance of power
might be shifting. Smaller schools are
narrowing the talent gap, helping them
consistently compete with the powers
that traditionally dominate the month of
March.

Few outside of central California
knew the name Omar Samhan before the
tournament’s ﬁrst round. And, judging
by the way Villanova tried and failed to
guard St. Mary’s 7-foot center, they too
were slow on the uptake. After scoring 29
points in the opener against Richmond,
Samhan came back and dropped 32 on
heavily favored ’Nova.

A team that relies on the fast-paced
play of its guards, Villanova could do
nothing but flail in vain as Samhan
repeatedly caught the ball down low, spun
and banked it in.

Fouling him didn’t work. A 73-percent
free throw shooter, he converted six of
eight attempts.

Double-teaming didn’t work either.
Either Samhan would ﬁght through _the
smaller defenders and lay it in, or kick
it out to one of the No. l0-seeded Gaels’

ﬁne shooters, who buried seven threes
including a 25-footer to seal the game.

A day later, Wisconsin ran into the
same dilemma. Comell’s Jeff Foot, also
a 7-footer of little national renown, took
control of the interior. He tallied 12
points and seven rebounds and provided
his team with the outlet passes necessary
to force Wisconsin out of its trademark
plodding style.

With Foot entrenched in the middle
and 6-foot 6 swingman Ryan Whitman
heaving shots over his significantly
shorter defenders, Cornell shot 61 percent
and put up 87 total points against a
Wisconsin team that held opponents to
a regular season average of just 56 per
game.

This has become a trend among mid-
majors facing power conference teams;
superior height coupled with solid 3-
point shooting can keep any team in the
game, regardless of the gap in talent.
While teams like ’Nova, Wisconsin and
Kansas might have superior athletes,
their opponents have utilized superior
strategy, taking advantage of mismatches
and maintaining control of the game’s
tempo.

The basic formula can only take a team
so far, though. Past mid-majors have hit
perimeter shots and controlled the interior
with pure height rather than skill, yet still
been overrun late by the better team.

The difference this year is that smaller
schools have vastly improved on the
defensive end, employing a suffocating
team defense that has frustrated the likes

of future NBA players Sherron Collins
and Scottie Reynolds.

Northern Iowa, en route to its bracket-
busting victory, slowed Kansas’ offense
with its steady, smothering defense. This
slowed the game’s pace signiﬁcantly,
forcing the normally run-and-gun
Jayhawks to play half-court basketball.
UNl’s rope-a-dope style frustrated Kansas
into low-percentage shots and their
second chances. The result: 27 percent
shooting from 3-point range and just 67
total points. During the regular season,
the Jayhawks averaged 40.4 percent and
81.6 points.

With Cornell and St. Mary’s doing
similar jobs against their power conference
opponents, we enter the Sweet 16 with
perhaps the strongest trio of Cinderella
teams in recent memory. While Xavier in
2009 and Davidson in ’08 were certainly
memorable squads, there are few that
have so effectively neutralized opponents’
biggest threats.

For the rest of this tournament, teams
will have to adjust their game plans
around the underdogs rather than vice
versa. Fail to do that and, come next week,
those brackets could look even worse.

week. The team left Hampton-Sydney
with a 5-4 loss and “a bitter taste in
[their] mouths,” White said.

The team’s match-up against Hamp-
ton-Sydney was a repeat of the 2009
ODAC Championship game, a match
that also resulted in a W&L loss.

The doubles teams of White and
Becht, and Davis and Hall, playing at
the No. 2 and No. 3 seeds respectively,
each pulled out wins. Singles brought
two more victories from Hall at No. 3
and Brooke at No. 6. Three of the four
singles losses went into 3rd sets.

A theme of revenge popped up fre-
quently among members of the team.

“This loss will make our team much
hungrier to beat Hampden-Sydney when
we play them later this spring in the
ODAC Championships,” said White.

“We’re looking to put Hamp-
den-Sydney’s head on a platter, come
ODACs,” Davis added.

Another theme that frequently
emerged was the strong support each
member has for the individuals on the
team. In a sport that sometimes focuses
more on individuals, this team truly wins
and losses as a team, with each player
rarely focusing on himself and constant-
ly highlighting the strengths and hard
work ofthose around him.

The Generals ﬁnished the week with
a 7-4 overall record and a 6-1 confer-
ence record.

Sophomore Jeremy Becht fol-
lows through on his serve in
W&L’s 6-3 loss to N.C. Wesley-
an on Wednesday. Becht won
his No. 2 doubles match with
teammate first-year Hayden
White, 9-8, and lost his No. 2
singles match, 6-4, 5-7, 7-6

W&L trumps Guilford

A double-header victory improved the Generals to 6-8, 4-3 in ODACS

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

Another rocky start to the week for the
Washington and Lee baseball team was
quickly forgotten after back-to-back late
inning heroics on Saturday versus Guil-
ford. The team split a doubleheader with
Roanoke (2-4, 6-0) on Tuesday, dropped
a non-conference game to Stevenson on
Wednesday (9-7), then stole both games
from Guilford during their Saturday dou-
bleheader (5-4, 5-4).

Tough weather conditions earlier in the
season forced W&L and Roanoke to make
up their previously canceled weekend
games last Tuesday. There was not much
to write home about in the ﬁrst game, as
the Maroons used a four-run fourth inning
to carry them to a 4-2 win.

Senior pitcher Chuck Davidson took
the tough-luck loss as he dropped to 0-3
on the season. In the other dugout, Cody
Kidd scattered four hits across four score-
less innings of work for the win. Senior
ﬁrst baseman Hunter Serenbetz had him-
self a nice week and got things rolling
with a 2-3 performance at the plate and
was responsible for W&L’s only runs, a
two RBI single in the seventh.

Game. two was another story. Perfect
pitching and timely hitting ﬁnally came
together for the Generals and added up to
a 6-0 win for the good guys. Sophomore
pitcher Roger Strong worked six innings
for the win, surrendering it mere three hits
while fanning six hapless Maroons. Junior
pitcher Greg Laswell completed the shut-
out by working the last third of the game
and picking up a save in the process.

At the plate, junior outﬁelder Anthony
Cardona led the Generals’ offensive attack
with a big 3-5 day in which he knocked

in two RBIs and scored two runs himself.
W&Ljumped out to a 4-0 lead in the ﬁrst
and never looked back.

The next day, the team came home to
face off with Stevenson College and, de-
spite a late rally, still fell to Mustangs, 9-
7. First-year shortstop Jonathan Stutts had
a great afternoon, getting the Generals on
the board first with a solo bomb to deep
left center and then sparking a ninth-in-
ning rally. Stutts’ home run started a three-
run third inning for W&L. Sophomore
outﬁelder Mike Decembrino and senior
catcher Will Lewis each added an RBI.

Senior second baseman John Ditore looks toward home plate as
he begins a slide for the winning run of the game.

Things quickly turned south, how-
ever, when the Mustangs exploded for a
six-run, seven-hit ﬁfth inning. Stevenson
grew the lead to 9-3 with three more runs
in the sixth.

Down 9-4 entering the bottom of the
ninth, Stutts rapped a RBI single, followed
by a two-run double from ﬁrst-year out-
ﬁelder George Youmans.

But senior second baseman John Di-
t0re”s hard liner was caught and turned
into a double play that ended the game
before W&L could come all the way back.
The rally had the crowd riveted.

“lt’s baseball; anything can happen,”
said spectator Kit Burgin.

The Generals were set to play two
more games on Saturday against Guilford.
A beautiful day, a big crowd and a confer-
ence rival set the stage for a drama-ﬁlled
day. Down 4-3 entering the last at bat of
both games, W&L rallied both times for
two 5-4 walk-off wins.

in game one, senior outﬁelder C]
Thompson singled with one out and scored
on a Ditore single and a throwing error.
After a hit batter and a Lewis single to
load the bases, Serenbetz singled to give
the Generals the win.

The script in game two read very
similar. Thompson led off with a double.
Ditore then singled and advanced on a
sacriﬁce bunt by sophomore second base-
man Alston James. Lewis was intention-
ally walked to ﬁll the bases and Serenbetz
knocked in Thompson with a grounder to
third that ‘was misplayed. Cardona then
singled, scoring Ditore and giving W&L
its second win of the day.

Laswell completed a ﬁne week of

pitching with two wins in relief.

The wins on Saturday bumped the
Generals’ record to 6-8 on the year, but
more importantly, they are now 4-3 in the
ODAC after a slow start to the year.

The team is still looking for continued
consistency and hopes to build off of Sat-
urdays’ success. The team’s next game is
Tuesday at Shenandoah. The ﬁrst pitch
will be at 3:30 p.m.

VOLUME CXIII,

, Men’s Week

explodes on
campus

W&L males take their turn

at loving their bodies

By Dick E. Johnson
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee campus was half-empty
this week as tumbleweeds bounced around empty
dormitory hallways and fraternity hallways. Windfall
became the tranquil setting that landlords always
dreamed of. The baseball and lacrosse coaches
waited impatiently for their players to show up to
practice. But nobody would come.

The Knowledge Uplifting Men (KUM) group on
campus is under fire this week for its controversial re-
sponse to KEWL’s Love Your Body Week. Ever since
it splattered onto the scene three years ago, KUM has
tirelessly worked to promote men’s awareness around
campus. Despite some trouble getting the group up
and running initially, the group’s representation is
swiftly growing in size, and coming into the week,
KUM looked ready to explode at W&L.

However, KUM has not been without its setbacks.
Its version of the Red Flag Campaign two years ago
was quickly shut down when it was discovered men
were starting to share secrets that were too detailed
and maybe even a little too accurate.

In addition, KUM decided to spit out a couple
of “Did You Know?” posters about famous men in
history to complement their Red Flag Campaign.
Unfortunately, the administration needed to step in
and cockblock the situation once professors started
noticing some flaws in the “Did You Know?’ cam-
paign. Apparently God isn’t necessarily a man. Who
knew? I

The low—point in KUM’s history came two years
ago when the heads of the group decided to post some
anonymous stories about sexual assault at W&L.
Since they were conveniently both heads of the Tri-
dent at the time, they thought that March would be
an excellent time to voice all of the social abuses that
happen at W&L all at once. The athletically—minded
administration misconstrued the awareness campaign
for some kind of faux bracket and decided to pull the
plug on the Trident. KUM lay ﬂaccid.

But aﬂer two years of build-up and waiting, KUM
seemed a little too ready to go this spring. Desperate
to get some kind of action off as soon as possible,
the new heads of KUM decided to host their own
version of “Love Your Body” week. Thinking that
the plan was sure to stick onto the hearts and minds
of students across campus, they sold shirts, made
posters and even posted a little message on “Campus
Notices.”

However, KUM’s dream turned into a nightmare
in less than ten seconds. On the ﬁrst Monday of the
male “Love Your Body Week,” every door on the
ﬁrst ﬂoor of Graham-Lees was locked tight and not
a male was to be seen. Kroger, CVS and Walmart
all had to put new orders in for their empty lotion
aisles, and there are no longer any Kleenex tissues
in Rockbridge County.

Also, there will be a memorial service at Lee
Chapel this Friday for the recent death of baby angels
and kittens in the town of Lexington. Apparently, at
W&L men do love their bodies... just maybe a little
too often.

Having made a mess of everything, KUM has
recently released a statement that it pledges to -“clean
this mess so that no stains will be left.” They have
also said that they are “sincerely sorry and had no
idea that it would work like that.”

An administration official certainly hopes so:
“This campus is starting to look like Sweet Briar. It’s
ridiculous. Also, none of the video streaming works
online. Damn that March Madness!”

The repercussions of KUM’s mess will be felt
for weeks, but there is still hope for the future. They
are currently working in tandem with VMl’s KUM
chapter on a new campaign to promote the plight of

-“unwanted touching” that men face daily in the town
of Lexington: l in every, oh, about 412 or so.

Just remember, as KUM says: CLEAN IT UP.

Drug bust at
Lee House?!

Suspicious substances found at President Ruscio is house, but students and SJC
question whether his intent to distribute really violates the honor system

By crystal Beth
STAFF WRITER

The Rockbridge County Sheriff’s
Department and Lexington Police
Department continue their investiga-
tion of the Lexington drug ring that,
it seems, touches all echelons of the
Washington and Lee community.

The Department conﬁscated what
it believes to be drugs in a March
27 search of the Lee House, where
President Ken Ruscio resides.

The material conﬁscated includes
923 bags of white powder, making
this the biggest drug bust in Lexing-
ton since the Jan. 23 search. In the
real world, this quantity is generally
considered indicative of an intent to
distribute.

A guilty verdict of intent to dis-
tribute Schedule II drugs (metham-
phetamine, morphine, PCP, cocaine,
methadone and Ritalin) carries a mini-
mum penalty offive years in jail.

However, no arrests have been
made at this time.

Rockbridge County Sheriff Bob
Day said that the investigation is
ongoing. “I don’t think we under-
stood how fully the drug issue had
permeated the W&L community,”
he said. “We’re still trying to gather
the facts.”

While it may appear to some that
the facts point to Ruscio as a cocaine
distributor to W&L students, Day said

that the evidence is not certain. The
most important factor on Ruscio’s
side is that the material was found
within the W&L bubble, not actually
in Lexington.

Although the quantity of material
conﬁscated can mean intent to distrib-
ute, it could also mean intent to party
like it’s Wall Street in the 1980s. The
fact that the baggies were discovered

to Colombia.

“The W&L community should
not overreact to this news,” she said.
“Drug busts happen. What matters
here at W&L is that students and
faculty uphold the honor system
in all aspects of life. And if you’re
having awesome parties, you should
acknowledge everything that aided
you in doing so.”

“The point of the honor system is that we

hold one another accountable. But I wouldn’t

want to be held accountable for this. So why
should I hold K-Rusch accountable? ”

WORTHINGTON ALEXANDER HOLEKAMP ROCKWOOD V,

SJC rep

the day ofFancy Dress could point to
innocent plans for a really awesome
after-party at the Lee House that, be-
cause of the bust, did not occur.
Ruscio was not available for com-
ment. According to Dean Dawn Wat-
kins, he was called away on business

The general attitude of the W&L
community appears to be in agreement
with Watkins. “Why are we holding
Ruscio to a higher standard than we
hold ourselves?” asked sophomore
SJ C representative Worthington Alex-
ander Holekamp Rockwood V.

“The point of the honor system
is that we hold one another account-
able. But I wouldn’t want to be held
accountable for this. So why shouldl
hold K-Rusch accountable?

“lt’s not like he cheated on a test,”
Rockwood added. “This is a much
more low-key issue, like sexual as-
sault or something.”

However, some members of the
W&L community are not as lax (nor
as sweet) in their judgment. ‘‘I think
that’s against the law,” said one female
student who wished to remain anony-
mous. “He should like, go tojail or do
community service. I think. And like,
what are they doing with the cocaine?
Are they going to share?”

It is, in fact, not clear what pun-
ishments Ruscio may face if he is
found guilty of possession and intent
to distribute. After all, the alleged
crime occurred on campusAnot in
the real world. “But would he even
go to the SJC for a hearing?” asked
Rockwood. “He’s not a student. But
he used to be?”

Traveller plans to oﬂer a cash bar on buses to bring in money and expand routes

By Maryjane Houston C-School DuPont

ALCOHOLIC

The successful safe ride program
known as Traveller is looking to
expand its service by adding two
additional buses by the start of the
next fall term.

But the task of hiring new driv-
ers and purchasing new buses will
require more money than originally
anticipated. Students and Traveller
staff havetossed around various sug-

The committee doesn’t doubt that
the project would bring in money. In
addition to fundraising, having access
to a bar will make the experience of
riding Traveller more enjoyable, thus
encouraging more people to take
advantage of the service, said this
student. “There will be no reason not
to ride Traveller,” she said.

Students, drivers and Traveller

graduate in two months. All we can really do

is get blackout as often as possible, or we ’ll

just be depressed, you know?”

gestions for bringing in funds, and the
most popular one is to implement a
cash bar on the Traveller buses.

“It seemed like the obvious
choice,” said a member of the stu-
dent Traveller committee. “People
ride Traveller because they like to
drink.”

staffers have reported an increase in
the demand for sober rides this year,
Dean Dawn Watkins said. Students are
partying longer and more frequently,
and the need for transportation has
exceeded the current capacities of the
bus and dispatch systems.

One senior economics major,

Robert Conrad Vlll, said he blames
the economy for the recent surge in
partying seven days a week. “There’s
no hope for getting a job when we
graduate in two months,” he said.
“All we can really do is get blackout
as often as possible, or we’ll just be
depressed, you know?”

The new buses and drivers would
allow Traveller to expand its routes to
reach more off-campus houses. The
buses will also be able to make stops
more frequently, so students will not
have to wait as long.

If the fundraising project is suc-
cessful, the buses will expand their
service to seven days a week instead
of the current schedule of Wednesday,
Friday and Saturday.

The new cash bar service will
include a bartender and a small but
well-stocked bar in the back of each
bus. The initial service will offer a
variety of beer, wine, vodka and rum,
but if successful, it could be expanded
to a full bar.

Students polled expressed over-
whelming enthusiasm for the new
service. Some said the offer of
more alcohol is an incentive to ride
Traveller instead of driving home
drunk or falling asleep on the lawn
at Windfall.

“Getting on Traveller and having

to abstain from drinking for the nine-
minute ride back to the quad is such a
letdown,” said ﬁrst-year Ashley-Beth
Louisa Hadley. “Now, we can just
keep partying all the way back!”

Traveller staffers who worked on
this proposal were concerned that stu-
dents might not want to pay for drinks
when they could get them free at the
party they just left. But houses often
run out of beer and plastic cups before
the parties clear out, and party-goers
tire quickly of Natty from a keg. The
hope is that shots and cocktails on
Traveller will provide an appealing
alternative and encourage students
to shell out some cash for a few more
drinks.

It is not yet known whether or
not the Traveller bartenders will be
required to check lDs.

Swine flu means no more sunrises

Sunrise sandwiches, the popular breakfast item served at the co-op, have been linked to a rise in H 1 N1 cases

By Samuel Adams
BREWER PATRIOT

Cafe ’77, otherwise known
as the co-op, has discontinued
serving sunrise sandwiches after
a government report linked the
breakfast concoctions with last
year’s outbreak of swine ﬁu.

While ﬁrst-years will not re-
member the swarm of reporters
who descended upon the Wash-
ington and Lee campus after it
was the home of some of the
ﬁrst reported cases of HINI in
Virginia, many students ﬁnally
realized the gravity of the situ-
ation after the co-op quit selling
sunrises.

The report from the Food and

Drug Administration admonished
W&L Dining Services for selling
the sandwiches, noting that pigs

, and pork products are clearly

declared unclean in Leviticus 11.
According to the report, Dining
Services “should have foreseen
that the consumption of pork

“It is so important that students take care

of themselves by washing their hands and

not doing heroin and eating breakfast. ”

JAN KAUFMAN, director of health promotion

products could be hazardous to
customers’ health.”

Students are reportedly tak-
ing a variety of safety measures,
including more frequent hand-
washing and adhering to other
statements in the ritual Jewish
law. Students are now ignoring
shellﬁsh and not wearing clothes
made of two different materials.

Director of Health Promotion
Jan Kaufman was ecstatic that
students were ﬁnally paying at-
tention to principles of basic hy-
giene, such as making sure one’s
hands are clean before eating a
sunrise—or anything else.

‘‘It is so important that stu-
dents take care of themselves
by washing their hands and not
doing heroin and eating breakfast
—obviously not those sunrise
sandwiches, though.”

Kaufman added that students
should be nice to Traveller driv-
ers and not smoke marijuana.
She also asked if her new posters
about underage drinking were
attractive.

Several students, including
sophomore Levi Throckmor-
ton, said that Dining Services
should have put a warning label
on the delectable—and profit-

able—snacks.

“It just seems so obvious in
retrospect: of course we would
get swine ﬁu from eating pork,”
Throckmorton said. “We’re just
lucky there hasn’t been another
outbreak,” he added.

Dining Services plans to have
sunrise sandwiches back for sale
within the week with new meat
options, such as beef and chicken.
Until then, students will have to
ﬁnd other options to satisfy that
late-night hunger.

Copy editors stop

Their have been tuns uv
complaints sent into the Wring
Tum Fi office over the past
week about the quality of copy
editing in the newspepper. Af-

' ter weeks, of long hours and

‘ tire-less, Thankless work, thuh

for the kids at skool, the copy
editors wanted to sleep and stuff.
Lifes just different then it used
to be back in the day wen copy
editors were ‘loved.

“May be I will want to work
more if we get to lay down. But ,

“Your not gonna believe what we

have to go threw here. ”

KATHRIN ROOBBERTS, copie editr
 

A copy editors decided that enuf

was enuf.

“Your not gonna believe
what we have to go threw here,”
sed one of the most inﬂamed
editors.-

Having to wrok late days

I just was two much for editors
I guess. Each and every editor
especially explicates either con-
sistent or persistent methods of
checking stuff and things within
articles.

Ever since some year when
they started coming, copy edi-
tors have had a mad crazy affect
on how super—duper awesome
the newpaper can bee.

How? Ever times have

1 changed! With Work pillingup,

exams coming, and teacher’s '
making homework, and stuff

for right now, we really need to
get to work?”

And the regular are still doing
ﬁn w/o having to worry about the
worrisome copy editors.

OH, I forgot, a copy editor
said that last comment right be-
fore that last sentence. The head
editor assured everyone again
that the reg. editors r much more
imPortant than them. Them is
the ocpy editors btw.

In other news, the head of
the English Department recently '
suffered a heart attack after read-
ing this article.

Fire Chief Ty Dickerson found

 

the new top level in violation of
no fewer than sixteen ﬁre safety
codes. The most notable violation
is the floor-wide recycled-mate-
rial content, which is both highly
ﬂammable and a crime against
interior design.

“lt’s unbelievable that they
thought adding a video editing
room to this monstrosity of a
building was worth risking the
lives of students,” Dickerson
remarked in his report.

He added that “the coffee cart
is just another accident waiting
to happen.”

To get the library back up to
code, a reverse renovation will be-
gin at the end of Spring Term. The
project is expected to take about
two years, as ﬁnding paneling to
match the building’s original 1979
exterior may take a while.

As during the original reno-
vation, which started during the
summer of 2008, the circulation
desk will be moved near Northen
Auditorium on the Lower Level 1,
which is the second level from the
top. It really makes no sense.

Senior Nicole Allaband, who
works at the circulation desk, is
supportive of the changes. “I’m
glad the school is putting the stu-
dents’ safety ﬁrst. Plus, my job
is so much easier when we’re not
on the main ﬂoor—hardly anyone
knows where to ﬁnd us.”

The IT HelpDesk will also be
relocating. Instead of returning
to a lower level, however, they
will be occupying a new loca-
tion——joining the Business Office
on the second floor of the old
courthouse.

Junior EW Malachosky, a
HelpDesk work-study, reports
that moving the service into
town should expedite computer
repair services, as “no one in
their right mind will be lugging
their computer to 2 South Main.
The one guy dumb enough to do
that will have virtually no line in
front of him.”

Most Washington and Lee
students will ﬁnd swiping home a
new MacBook from the bookstore
much more convenient.

Still, not all ofthe original $3.5

million project will go to waste.
The distinctive egg-shaped seats,
which are manufactured entirely
from celery, will be used in the
Marketplace as part of W&L
Dining Services’ Sustainability
Initiatives.

The large flat-screen tele-
vision, which currently greets
students who enter the library
from the side entrance, will join
the other ﬂat-screen in the Elrod
Commons atrium. The adminis-
tration is still keeping the purpose
of the ﬁrst flat-screen in the Com-
mons secret.

Some pieces of furniture, such
as the high—backed couches found
in the rear ofthe main level, will
not be kept. Start checking Cam-
pus Notices this Spring Term to
own your own piece of W&L
history and to support the $3.5
million effort to re-renovatate
Leybum Library.

Even shorter spring  

Spring term shortened to 12 days, classes will meet at least 16 hours a day

By Trevor the Toad
CROSSWORD ASSISTANT

Get ready to say goodbye to
the new Spring Term: President
Ruscio has already begun discuss-
ing changes for next year’s term
schedule.

“The feedback we’ve gotten so
far this year about the reduction to
a four-week Spring Term is over-
whelming,” Ruscio declared in a
recent release on the Washington
and Lee website. “To capitalize
on this success, Spring Term 2011
will be only 12 days long.”

Students will experience “fully
engaging” courses, such as Chi-
nese 327: History ofthe Egg Roll
and Music 271: The Complete
Works of Celine Dion.

Each course will meet for at
least 16 hours a day. The dining
hall will not be expanding its
hours of operation to accommo-
date students.

Many courses will require
additional fees. One journalism
course will require students to
purchase HD video cameras~
students will not be permitted to
keep the extra equipment after the
course is over. Not all courses
will disclose these costs before
registration.

Other courses will involve
travel around the United States.
Professor Harlan Beckley is
planning a poverty class in which
students will live on the streets of
Camden, NJ. for a week.

Students will pay over $1,000
for this trip, which does not pro-
vide food or lodging. “It’s an
engaging experience that I know
most W&L students will be inter-
ested in,” remarked Beckley.

“Undergraduates at this school
have grown tired of going to Gos-

hen every weekend,” he said.

The professor expects around
40 or 50 students to try to get into
his course, though onlytwelve
spots are available.

In fact, for the 1,700 under-
graduates who will be at W&L
next spring, only 450 spots will
be available in a total of 32
courses. Many of those courses
will be offered by the Russian
department.

Ruscio believes that limiting
the options available to students
will force them to truly achieve a
liberal arts education.

“If these kids really wanted to
learn math or physics, they’d have
gone to MIT,” he said. “They
want broader horizons, and we’re
happy to oblige.”

To this end, Ruscio is also
eliminating the Spring Option.

“There’s nothing that an intem-
ship in New York or Washington
can teach our students that can’t
be learned right here in Rock-
bridge County.”

Besides the poverty courses
that put students in realistic situa-
tions of poverty, all other courses
involving travel, such as Spring
Term Abroad, will be canceled.

A source from the faculty
said none of the faculty were
actually consulted before Ruscio
made this decision about the new
spring term.

“Ruscio knows best,” said
this professor, who preferred to
remain anonymous.

When asked what they thought
about these new Spring Term
plans, every W&L student re-
plied, “It sucks.”

Finding a
match

W&L students band together
to help with a junior 3 battle

against leukemia

By Allison Chopin
MANAGING EDITOR

The Alphi Phi Alpha fraternity partnered with
the American Cancer Society to host a bone mar-
row drive in the Commons on Friday in honor
of a Washington and Lee student who is battling
cancer.

Junior Erica Regester was diagnosed with leu-
kemia in high school and declared cancer-free in
2008. But in December, she relapsed and has been
undergoing treatments again. She is currently in
need of a bone marrow transplant.

The drive on Friday allowed members of the
W&L community to add their names to the bone
marrow registry. By doing this, they could become
a match for a cancer patient in need, such as
Regester.

Students who participated saw the drive as
a chance put their names out there as potential

“I would hope that if I was
in a position where I needed
something like this, other
people... would be willing to

I

overcome their fears... ’

RANDI WILSON, first-year
 

donors who could save a patient’s life.

“I would hope that ifl was in a position where
I needed something like this, that other people like
me would be willing to overcome their fears to do
the same,” said ﬁrst-year Randi Wilson.

Wilson said she was interested when she saw
the posters around campus that shared Regester’s
story instead of just asking people to sign up for a
donation drive.

“It meant a lot more that they put a name and a
face to the bone marrow drive,” she said.

Participating in the drive was a simple, l5-min-
ute process. Those interested visited the Commons,
ﬁlled out a form, and had their cheeks swabbed.
The tissue sample taken from the saliva is used to
match the donor with potential patients who need a
transplant. By signing up, donors agreed that they
would be willing to donate to any patient in need.

The goal was to have 100 students, faculty and
staff sign up for the drive, said Sean Bates, advisor
for Alpha Phi Alpha. The event was held from 9
am. to 4 p.m., and Bates said students were lining
up to participate as early as 8 a.m. By 2:30, nearly
70 had signed up.

Regester was active in last year’s Relay for
Life, a fundraiser for cancer patients. She gave a
talk about her experience with cancer at the event,
and she also started the shaved head contest. For
the contest, people donated money to vote for a
male professor, and the winning professor would
have to shave his head.

Losing one’s hair is one of the painful experi-
ences that come with battling cancer, so Regester
wanted to illuminate this reality as well as start
a fun competition, she said last year. The contest
raised over $500.

Regester could not be reached for comment this
past weekend.

Less noise, shorter parties?

New ordinance calls for quieter nights, but could better student-neighbor relations

By Lizz Dye
STAFF WRITER

The Rockbridge County Board
of Supervisors held a public hearing
this Monday, March 22 at 7 pm. and
passed a proposed new county noise
ordinance. This noise ordinance was
passed as a result from years of com-
plaints from residents who live near
students and have suffered from the
noise and trash that students make.
Particular sections of the ordinance
which may affect students are listed
below:

Article IV, Section 4-40 ofthe or-
dinance states that “at certain levels,
noise can be detrimental to the health,
welfare, safety, peace, and quality of
life of the citizens of the county, and
in the public interest, noise should
be controlled. It is, therefore, the
policy ofthe County to reduce noise
in the county and to prohibit certain
unnecessary, excessive, harmful and
annoying noises.” _

The ordinance deﬁnes “noise” as
“any sound which annoys or disturbs
humans or which causes or tends to
cause an adverse psychological or
physiological effect on humans.”

Section 4-43 states, “It shall be
unlawful for any person, on Sunday
through Thursday between the hours
of 11:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. the fol-
lowing day, and on Friday and Satur-
day between the hours of l l :59 p.m.
and 8:00 a.m. the following day:

(I) To use, operate or play any
radio, phonograph, television, record,
compact disc or tape player, musical
instrument, loudspeaker, sound am-
plifying equipment or other machine
or device capable of producing or re-
producing sound in such a manner or
with such volume or duration that it

is plainly audible: (i) inside the con-
ﬁnes of the dwelling unit, house or
apartment of another person or (ii) at
50 or more feet from the device.

(2) To create or allow noise
from talking, yelling, shouting, whis-
tling or singing, or any combination
thereof, that is plainly audible either
inside the conﬁnes of the dwelling
unit, house or apartment of another
person or at 50 or more feet from
the source(s) of the noise, when the
noise is generated from a gathering
of ten or more people.”

Additionally:

(1) Any person who violates
any provision of this article shall
be deemed guilty of a Class 3 mis-
demeanor for the ﬁrst offense. Any
person who violates any provision
ofthis article within one (1) year af-
ter a previous conviction under this
article shall be guilty of a Class 2
misdemeanor. Any person who com-
mits a third or subsequent violation
of any provision ofthis article within
one (1) year after a previous convic-
tion shall be guilty ofa Class I mis-
demeanor.

Senior Matt Hutton, one of the
leaders of the Campus-Community
Coalition, believes that this is a step
in the right direction towards im-
proving student-neighbor relations.
He says that there “has always been
tension between non-student neigh-
bors and students. In the past, stu-
dents weren’t really aware that many
of the residents in the neighborhoods
they live aren’t exclusively students,
but also families and adults withjobs.
The Campus-Community Coalition
tries to promote this awareness to

students because many neighbors are
upset about students being too loud
and messy.”

He says that this new ordinance
was not supposed to be targeted at
other students, and in the end there
were actually a few things that
worked in students’ favors. First,
neighbors are now more in favor of
cooperating and working with stu-
dents, and the Campus-Community
Coalition has encouraged residents
to call students’ houses before calling
the police. Hutton said he would like
to create a phone list to give to resi-
dents, and to encourage students to
develop good relationships with their
neighbors. In addition, the county
sheriffs hope that they will not get so
many calls to go to students’ houses
late at night because these calls strain
their services and they would rather
direct their resources elsewhere.

Hutton believes that these chang-
es made by the Board of Supervisors
are very minor and though they may
seem like a slap in the face, he does
not think students have any reason
to worry since the noise is only lim-
ited until ll p.m. on the weekdays.
Furthermore, he believes that as long
as students are willing to cooperate
with their resident neighbors, there
should not be any problems and
hopefully improve the tensions that
have occurred for years.

Wind wallops frosh lot

Meteorological phenomenon known as a wind shear fells trees, damages cars

By Katy Stewart
STAFF WRITER

Last Monday morning at 8 a.m.,
a wind shear accompanying a rain-
storm wreaked havoc on the north-
ern part of campus. The powerful
meteorological phenomenon tore

down trees and caused thousands of
dollars’ worth of damage to cars in

 
  
   
 
  
  
  
   
  

the freshman lot. Wind shears, such
as Monday’s, usually accompany
tornadoes and hailstorms, and fonn a
narrow gust of intense wind.

Mike Carrnagnola, the head of
Facilities Management, said that the
storm was an “oddball high pressure
and low pressure event where the
conditions came together enough to
literally snap trees in half.” The shear
“ripped a line straight through the
area,” Carrnagnola said. “The good
news is that it was not through the
middle of campus.”

The Pavilion, athletic ﬁelds and

rope course were all affected by the
shear. The batting cage at the base-
ball ﬁeld was “picked up and blown
around,” Carmagnola said, and the
ropes course needs to be put back to-
gether. However, “amazingly, not a
building was damaged,” he said.

The biggest concern was the
freshman parking lot. The shear act-
ed “almost like a buzz saw” cutting
trees in half, and four cars parked
along the edge of the lot were nearly
totaled by fallen trees. Another car
was damaged by a lacrosse goal that
was thrown by the wind into the back
of the vehicle. “A couple [cars] were
fairly severe... and we have allowed
the more severely damaged vehicles
to park temporarily in the garage,”
said Jeff Hanna, Executive Director
of Communications and Public Af-
fairs.

COURTESY OF JEFF HANNA

Carinagnola got the call about the
damage at 8:10 a.m. Monday, and he
and his team immediately started to
secure the area. Within 24 hours, the
blocked roadways and blocked access
to the freshman lot were cleared.

The next biggest goal was to no-

tify the students whose cars were
affected, and get in touch with their
insurance providers.

“We are assisting them [students]
with the reports,” said Hanna. Pho-
tos were taken and an assessor came
to determine insurance costs and li-
ability.

Health care ‘reform’ is no doubt Obama’s biggest blunder

Only eight more months until November, the month that Democrats will get the political comeuppance they deserve

By Abel Delgado
co LU M NIST

After regaining his impres-
sive sense of arrogancewan ar-
rogance that could make the last
two arrogant presidents look as
humble as Mother Theresa—
President Obama decided to
cynically challenge all those who
dare to disagree with him.

“Go for it,” our president said,
regarding attempts torepeal the
health care bill, “Be my guest.”
Well, Mr. President, only if you
insist.

Mr. President, please stop
calling the recent health care
legislation “reform.” It does not
“amend or improve by change
of form or removal of faults or
abuses.”

It is an abuse of power on
both your part and the part of
anyone who voted in favor of it
after taking an oath to protect the
Constitution.

American government much better than we think

Where exactly in the Consti-
tution does the federal govem-
ment gain the right to force citi-
zens to buy a good or servicejust
because they are alive?

ideas, taking $570,000,000,000
out of Medicare, a government
entitlement program that may
be bankrupt by the end of the
decade, to fund a new govem-

mere thought of it was enough to
turn Virginia red again, give Re-
publicans charge of New Jersey
and gain a senatorial seat in Mas-
sachusetts, of all places.

“How about using some of the most ridiculous accounting this side of

Enron? That was a great idea. Anyone who actually believes Obam-

acare will cut the deﬁcit must be on some very strong medication. ’

I

I guess the individual man-
date is such a great idea it does
not need Constitutional justiﬁca-
tion. For all the talk of your pre-
decessor ignoring the Constitu-
tion—which he did a few times
too many—your supporters are
acting as if it never existed.

Here are some other great

ment entitlement program few
people want. Medicare may be
poorly run but at least it’s popu-
lar among the electorate.

This new legislation, which to
the discredit of your legacy has
been dubbed “Obamacare,” is by
no means popular. A year of poll-
ing and elections prove this. The

If you and your followers
think you know better than the
majority of the American people,
if you think you know what is
good for us and we do not, then
you are in for a sad awakening
come November.

How about using some of the
most ridiculous accounting this

side of Enron? That was a great
idea. Anyone who actually be-
lieves Obamacare will cut the
deﬁcit must be on some very
strong medication.

Another great idea by your
companions in Congress, appar-
ently completely defecating on
the traditional legislative pro-
cess is in these days.

Reconciliation has been used
quite often, but exclusively for
budgetary matters. Is Obamacare
a purely budgetary matter? No,
but since the rules of the Senate
meant the bill would not pass,
then your cohorts simply ignored
the rules, just like you ignored
the will ofthe people.

That’s an excellent precedent
to set in a representative democ-
racy.

I can keep on going with the
many ways Obamacare is worse

than the dysfunctional system we
had prior to it, but the opposing
side will obviously not listen to
reason.

They will call my side, the
side with millions of Republi-
cans, Democrats, and indepen-
dents who wanted real reform
but recognize government slime
when they see it, extremists.

They will use the hate-ﬁlled
words of the few to stereotype
the understandable concern felt
by the many.

Fortunately for us, this will
not work. We live in a democra-
cy with regularly scheduled elec-
tions, and those who supported
Obamacare will come to learn
that votes have consequences.

Immature, unappreciative, and obsessed with partisanship, Americans still have it better than European governments

By Hal Bozarth
COLUMNIST

A purple America? We’re all
the same~young and whining,
that is.

At ﬁrst glance, today’s Amer-
ica has never been more divided.
All of her cities and coasts vote
for the Democrats, while rural
states and the South lean toward
Republican candidates. The right
and left pull toward opposite
ends of the political spectrum,
threatening to tear the country
in two.

Conservatives scream that
Barack Obama is a socialist
Muslim threatening to bring the
Red Menace home to our heart-
land, while Liberals spout off
about George Bush creating a
quasi-fascist state oppressed by

the Patriot Act.

Cry me a river. Can’t anybody
ever be satisﬁed with things as
they are?

No. Not in this country, at
least.

President Obama has been
racketing up his ‘post-partisan’
rhetoric of late — he, along with
his fellow Democratic wielders
of power, emphatically assert
that partisan politics are prevent-
ing the US from reaching its full
potential; from pulling away
from the recession; from mov-
ing forward in the perceived race
against China. What he really
means to say is, “Waaah, I want
all of my stuff done!”

THE MEDIA BOARD

with the opposition and a vision
of America as a thoroughly di-
vided nation is not unique to our
current president.

The call to move ‘beyond’
partisanship has been practically
a political constant for at least
the past thirty years.

President Bush wanted (and,
for all intents and purposes,
got) the full support of Con-
gress in going to war against
our post-9/ll enemies.

President Clinton, like
Obama, wanted a nationalized
component of healthcare.

Reagan and Bush, Sr., want-
ed to present a united front
against the ever-desperate Soviet
Empire.

What most Americans fail
to realize (or, at least, publicly
acknowledge) is that the United
States is uniﬁed to an extraordi-
nary degree.

As a young democracy, the
United States still maintains an
attitude based in immaturity:
Americans all know what is right,
what is wrong, and what should
be done. We don’t question if
we’re correct or ifthere even is a
‘right’ way to do things.

We all have an answer for
every issue facing our nation,
even if those answers vary dra-
matically from person to person,
party to party, class to class.

Take, for example, the Mus-
lim world. The conservative
right impugns the Middle East
for harboring terrorists, threat-
ening Israel, declaring Holy
War on Christianity, and for (in
Iran’s case) Inenacing the United
States and her allies with poten-
tial nuclear arsenals. The left,
similarly, viliﬁes the Caliphate
over its treatment of women,
homosexuals, teenagers and the

Looking at China’s rise to
worldwide prominence, both
ends of the American political
spectrum see China as an antag-
onist. However, each views the
alleged problem through seem-
ingly disparate perspectives:
unionist liberals bemoan the loss

lumberjacks.

We, as Americans, know
what is to be done. Our problems
lie not in what to do, how to do
it or even whether or not to do
anything at all but in actually do-
ing it.

As a result of our immaturity,
the only realistic way to change

“What mostAmericans fail to realize (or, at

least, publicly acknowledge) is that the United

States is uniﬁed to an extraordinary degree.

ofjobs to the penniless Chinese
laborer, while conservatives see
in Red China the same peril they
felt before Reagan tore down the
Berlin Wall.

Our similarities extend past
international politics, too. If you
travel anywhere in the coun-
try, from San Francisco’s Cas-
tro Street to Fred Phelps’ To-
peka, Kansas, you will be told
that something is going wrong
in America and that you must
change your ways.

Christians believe that the
‘degradation’ of American so-
ciety will bring the wrath of
God down upon us—unless, of
course, we ban gay marriage,
abortion, divorce, single parent-
hood, cosmetic surgery and Hol-
lywood.

Environmentalists believe
that the ‘degradation’ of the en-
vironment will bring the wrath of
Nature down upon us in the form
of rising sea levels, drastically
changing climates, and monthly
Katrina-like hurricanes~unless,
of course, we ban SUVs, air con-
ditioning, carbon dioxide, coal,
airplanes, factories, mines, and

anything or to break any dead-
lock is to use force, be it eco-
nomic or populist.

In America, might makes
right. Thankfully, we have one
of the world’s most ﬂexible gov-
ernments at our disposal——other-
wise, we may have already had
more than one civil war.

Europeans face much more
divisive arguments within their
mature democracies. They don’t
know what to dc%or even if
anything is to be done at all.

Britain and France, espe-
cially, are at a point in their na-
tional lives where government
can openly ask: “Is there even a
‘right’ way anymore?”

They hesitate to look down at
anyone except the most blatant
of the world’s offenders: even
then, they only begin to act in
earnest when their national goals
are directly threatened. When
they ﬁnally choose to act, they
remain lethargic in the face of
public self-loathing: the Falk-
land Islands question causes
Britons to think ofthemselves as
the Imperialist wrongdoer, and
debates about who is considered

a citizen of France are making
slow progress even in the face
of a burgeoning Algerian immi-
grant population.

Western Europe (Russia, Po-
land and the like are a different
matter) faces one philosophi-
cal quandary after another. The
United Kingdom questions its
very existence.

Why isn’t it just England,
Scotland, Wales and (Northern)
Ireland? Why aren’t they sepa-
rate? Are the English holding
their massive swords to the col-
Iective Celtic throat, as they have
done for hundreds ofyears? Ifso,
that isn’t a very nicething to do.

France, Germany and the
smaller ontinental nations look
on, confused, as their sovereign-
ty is thrown into the ring and
pitted against the massive Euro-
pean Union.

What leverage does Belgium
have to play against the Euro?
Should it even remain indepen-
dent?

The United States has the
luxury of being able to do any-
thing—~and wanting, very badly,
to do something.

Domestic popular opinion is
the only thing steering the coun-
tiy, and I’m not sure we appreci-
ate this fact. America is truly an
independent nation: these united
states have a world of possibili-
ties laid out in front ofthem, and
need only pick a favorite.

Whatever it is, though, no-
body will be happy.

An open challenge to the Cadavers

Student offers the secret society a chance to regain the Cadavers ’honor

I To the Cadaver Society,

This is an open letter formal-
ly challenging you.

Over the last few years we
have been in a contest, seem-
ingly unknown to you. I have
acquired four of your banners,
re—hanging a number of them,
and this year I have unmasked
Cyrus McCormick. The score
currently stands at ﬁve — me,
zero — you. I

It seems that there is nothing
you can do which I can’t undo.
As such, I wish to oﬂ°er you a

challenge, a chance to save the
meager scrap of respect you’re
still clinging to.

I challenge you to hang a ban-
ner somewhere on campus and
keep‘ it. hanging for two nights
in a row. The time of the hang-
ing of this banner, and the two
following nights, must be dur-
ing regular school days - break
and ﬁnals will not count. If you
hang the banner during night
time, that night shall not count
as the ﬁrst night, but rather the
next two nights will satisfy the
requirement.

Additionally, the banner must

-be in a highly visible place. All

your previous locations of the
last few years have been per-
fectly acceptable locations to
hang them.

In the unlikely chance that
you are able to do so, you will
reclaim some of your lost re-
spect from both myself and the
W&L society as a whole.

However, in the event that I
succeed in this contest, I shall
be given a key to the Cadaver
tunnels or some other manner
of reward, possibly a check?

I remind you, though, that‘ this ,
contest is not about me — but "
about reclaiming the respect
that you’ve lost.

Not hanging a banner will be ‘
seen as an act of acquiescence to
my superiority.

This is not an April Fool’s
Joke — this is a chance to regain
your respect.

Spring cleaning and reviewing the articles that didn’t work

After cleaning out his closet, Stockton Bullitt reviews some of the opinion ideas which couldn ’t be made into articles

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

Spring cleaning is ﬁnally
here, and thanks to this beautiful-
ly dreadful rain that will shower
Lexington for the week, I ﬁnally
have time to attend to the quag-
mire that is my bedroom. ‘

I know that guys are ste-

I reotypically messy and usually

when they have a few clothes on
the ground, the guy’s girlfriend
or mom beams as she rolls her
eyes and throws those shirts on
the hamper. However, I take
messiness to gargantuan heights.
I have a carpet of stained and
dirtied clothes, coupled with
sheets that would probably be
turned down by Goodwill.

You could say that I’m messy
because I’m lazy, but au con-
traire, I simply love the spring
cleaning process. I love taking an
afternoon off to rediscover shirts
I forgot I owned, random singles
and maybe even some unopened
drinks.

The only problem with spring
cleaning is actually getting my
lazy ass to start cleaning. It seems
way too arduous to drag myself
away from the umpteenth game
of Hearts to actually do some-
thing with my life. However,
once I ﬁnish that cleaning I have
a nice sense of accomplishment.

So that’s what I’m doing this
week for my opinion article: a
little spring cleaning. l’m drag-
ging out all of my failed topic
ideas, dusting them off and then
reminding myself why I wanted
to write about them in the ﬁrst
place.

But there is a reason these
ideas ended up lodged in be-
tween the futon and the moldy
Five Guys in the ﬁrst place. I’ll
make sure I remind you guys
of why I threw these topics out.
Time to close out of Hearts and
get started:

“How Sororities Greet the
Morning”

Why I liked the idea: There’s

some easy comedy here. Every

sorority has a pretty well-known
stereotype, and any time you can
insult a large group of peoplejust
so you can look better by default,
you have to do it. Plus, I just

. wanted to treat women at W&L

the same as men.

Why I threw it out: I know
it’s a little selﬁsh ofme, but I al-
ready have enough women at this
school who detest my existence. I
don’t need too many more. Plus,
I can handle angry fraternity
brothers: I’ll just get eye surgery.
But the only thing in this world
scarier than an angry sorority sis-
ter is my mom without coffee.

“2/3 the Fun”
(i.e., new spring term sucks)

Why I liked the idea: I have
heard many complaints around
campus from people who didn’t
get into any of the classes they
wanted, who can’t afford the
class they want to take and who
were irate that ﬁrst-years went

ﬁrst when sophomores went last.

Plus, that one journalism profes-
sor’s letter to the editor about
cancelling his class made the
room... uh... a little dusty.

Why I threw it out: I would
have to do actual research for
this article. People would need
to be emailed. Questions would
need to be asked. I would actu-
ally have to do some digging.
Look, I’m no superhero, so Ijust
stuck with the fake joumalism
section ofthe newspaper.
“Cancun Sucks in February”

(i.e., our spring break sucks)

Why I liked the idea: Spring
Break, like Natty and II a.m.
class, seems like one ofthose col-
lege experiences youjust have to
experience before you graduate.

Why I threw it out: I don’t
watch nearly enough MTV to
write 800 on the social beneﬁts
of body shots in Venus Beach,
Florida.

“Suck It, Republicans”
(Health Care trash—taIking)
Why I liked the idea: As a

dirty liberal, I unfortunately cele-
brated the passing of health care,
and it would’ve been nice just
to rub it in a little. Lately, l’ve
goaded some Repbulicans into
complaining about it loudly and
it sounds like music to my ears.
Why I threw it out: Convinc-
ing Jarrett Brotzman and Abel
Delgado that health care what-
ever-you-want-to-call-it isn’t the
legislative equivalent to Cher-
nobyl is like trying to convince
SPEAK it’s 1 in 5.
“7 a.m.... Thanks, Registrar”
(registration times are too evil)

stead. You win again, Registrar.

“Fancy Dress is Just Not

That Into You”

Why I liked the idea: I have
a few qualms with Fancy Dress.
One, l’ve already been to prom
and I don’t need to go to four
more that are even more geared
toward women. I mean, is next
year’s theme going to be “Must
Love Dogs?” Two, tens of thou-
sands on a four-hour dance?
Three, unless I’m in a relation-
ship, why would I want to pay
$150 for two tickets, $75 for two
dinners, $50 for a tux and another

“So that is what I ’m doing this week for my

opinion article: a little spring cleaning. 1 ’m

dragging out all ofmyfailed topic ideas,

dusting them oﬁ’ and then reminding myself

why I wanted to write about them in the first

place. ”

 

Why I liked the idea: I would
rather register for classes at 1:15
a.m. on a Friday night (or Sat-
urday morning) than sign up for
classes before the sun comes up
on Monday. I thought I came to
college for a four-year hiatus
from sleep deprivation, but the
Registrar would rather remind
me what being 16 is like. Want to
give me braces, too?

Why I threw it out: Like so-
rority girls and Republicans, the
Registrar can really mess up your
life ifyou get on its bad side. I’m
hoping to graduate before 2020,
and the only way I’m doing so is
by avoiding too much confron-
tation with the registrar. Also, I
would’ve written the article, but
I needed to catch up on sleep in-

$75 for a weekend’s worth ofal-
cohol just so I can get shut down
on the Pumptown dance floor?

Why I threw it out: Point
number three is already getting
me into trouble and expanding
on that topic will only dig the
hole deeper. Plus, messing with a
tradition that’s over a century old
is a terrible idea. Right, Jefferson
Davis?

“One on One with LexPo”

Why I liked this idea: I think
it’s high time that we start getting
on good terms with LexPo. Nei-
ther the police nor the students
likes feeling like we attend Kent
State. We can try and work some
stuff out, can’t we? Yes we can!

Why I threw it out: Around
sundown, I was walking over to

the station for the interview. Be-
ing a solo W&L student without
the sun to defend me, I was im-
mediately given a Drunk in Pub-
lic ticket.

“W&L’s Wednesday Nightlife”

Why I liked the idea: Fol-
lowing three anonymous guys
around campus on a Wednesday
night, seeing how they enjoy the
mid-week party. One of them
would’ve played World of War-
craft the entire time while the
other two would’ve no doubt
gotten themselves into trouble.

Why I threw it out: Lawyers
stepped in. Apparently, .I’m sup-
posed to tell them ﬁrst. Now I
have another restraining order to
add to my repertoire!

“The Joy of Disney”

Why I liked the idea: For
some strange reason, I had a
headache on Sunday morning.
I was in a crappy mood until I
ﬁipped the channel to “Mon-
sters, Inc.” This not only cheered
me up, but completely made my
morning. I would’ve strung out a
couple hundred words about how
secretly good movies like “Up”
and “Ratatouille” were, but...

Why I threw it out: I remem-
bered that if I’m going to talk
about kids’ movies this much, I’ll
probably need to register with the
state ﬁrst.

“How to pull an all-nighter at
W&L”

Why I liked the idea: There
are certain strategies that can re-
ally help you pull an all-nighter
at W&L, but only a few know
about them or put them into
practice. These include waiting
for the ﬁrst caffeinated beverage
until at least midnight. how to
keep yourself awake at the next
day‘s ll a.m. class and how to
get annoying people away from
your study group.

Why I threw it out: Pulling an
all-nighter makes you incredibly
lazy the next day, and since I’m
running on one right now, I know

for certain that there was no way
that I could do the research and
then write the ensuing article.
That is, without transferring to
Columbia.

“KD getting Kwan next year”

Why I liked the idea: This is an
underrated story, in my opinion.
There were quite a bit of people
who made a big deal about the
Kwan changing hands last year,
and for it to simply be passed
on again after one year could’ve
drawn a bigger reaction.

Why I threw it out: The last
person who made too big of a
deal about the Kwan got punched
in the face.

“The Monopoly Money Theo-
rem” (i.e., why swiping it home
doesn’t count for anything)

Why I liked the idea: I’m
positive that pretty much every-
one at this school has ﬁgured this
out, butjust in case you haven’t.
It would’ve been nice to do a
shopping guide to the Bookstore
when you don’t have to worry
about the repercussions until
June.

Why I threw it out: I didn’t
want my parents to ﬁnd out that
my $12 pen was really a $2 pen
and “The Hangover.”

“Even One Letter to the Editor
is Too Many”

Why I liked the idea: Just
like you, I got pretty exasper-
ated from having to edit sexual
assault article letters week after
week. There were better ways to
go about that whole process, and

back in the fall, I had a few good

ideas.

Why I threw it out: Every
time I ﬁll up a girl’s beer, I don’t
want her to think the foam is ﬁzz.
Furthermore, I think we’ve had
enough sexual assault for at least
a couple of months. Do you re-
ally want another four issues of
debate? I thought not. I’d much
rather talk about something in-
teresting, like the Registrar!

Generals hold strong in Fab Five Tourney

After a loss to UChicago, W&L women is tennis defeated Skidmore and Emory at the Mary Washington-hosted tournament

By Jayna Johns
STAFF WRITER

The No. 6-ranked Washington and
Lee women’s tennis team took on a col-
lection of impressive teams last week,
resulting in an up—and-down week. The
Generals lost 5-4 to the University of
Chicago on Wednesday; however, they
defeated Skidmore 7-2 and Emory 5-4
during the Fab Five Tournament hosted
by Mary Washington this weekend.

UChicago came to W&L’s campus
toting a No. 4 national ranking and the
No. 1 and No. 6 players in the central
region.

Two of the bigger matches of the
day were by sophomore Ellen Yeatman
and senior Lauren Caire. Second-seeded
Yeatman beat the No. 6 regional player
in Jennifer Kung, 6-4, 6-4. Caire, the
team’s No. 1 seed, nearly pulled off the
upset against the region’s No. I player,
Kendra Higgins. Caire battled down to

the wire, taking the third set tiebreaker
all the way to 11-9. The ﬁrst two sets
were also closely contended with scores
of 6-4, 5-7.

After Yeatman’s victory, the Gener-
als were tied with UChicago at 3-3, and
the back-and-forth trend continued with
subsequent matches.

The Generals’ No. 3 player, sopho-
more Ann Morris, lost her match against
Carmen Vaca Guzman, 6-3, 6-4. Sopho-
more Lauren Lukas lost the No. 4 sin-
gles match to Linden Li in another close
match at 3-6, 6-2, 10-5.

In the No. 5 match-up, sophomore
Jen Snyder won her match decisively, 6-
2, 6-4. Senior captain Blair Brzeski, who
ﬁnished out the line-up at the No. 6 spot,
also won her match, facing a tough 7-6
ﬁrst set, but dominating in the second,
6-0.

In doubles, only the No. 2 duo was
able to pull out their match. Morris and
Lukas teamed to down UChicago’s
Kung and Li, 8-4. No.1 doubles team,
Caire and Yeatman fell 8-5, and the No.
3 team of Snyder and Brzeski lost 8-4.

After the close loss to UChicago, the
Generals went to the Fab Five Touma-
ment, held by Mary Washington, where
they downed 22nd-ranked Skidmore by
a team score of 7-2 on Friday.

In singles competition, Yeatman won
her No. 1 singles match, 6-4, 6-2. Sec-
ond seeded Morris posted the lone sin-
gles loss, falling behind 6-0, 1-6, 6-0 in
a lopsided match.

Lukas won her No. 3 singles match,
6-7, 7-5, 10-3. Lukas came back from a
ﬁrst set disappointment for the win.

Snyder put away her No. 4 singles
match, 6-1, 6-2, and Brzeski posted a

similar victory of 6-2, 6-1 in the No. 5
singles match-up. First-year Sallie Grif-
ﬁn posted a tough victory in the No. 6
spot, taking down Skidmore’s player 6-
2, 5-7, 10-6.

Doubles competition also saw only
one W&L loss. The No. 1 doubles team
of Caire and Yeatman fell to Danika Ro-
bison and Nataly Mendoza, 8-4. But No.
2 doubles team Morris and Lukas won
8-2, and No. 3 team Snyder and Brzeski
also won 8-2.

Saturday continued the tournament
with a match against No. 2-ranked Em-
ory. It was a tough opponent, but W&L
came out in the lead, 5-4.

Much of the excitement stemmed
from two singles matches. Caire defeat-
ed the reigning DIII singles champion
Larne McManigle with a solid score of
6-4, 6-3 in the No. 1 spot. Lukas took her

No. 4 singles match to three sets before
securing not only her individual victory,

Up-and-down week again for baseball

The Generals knocked oﬂNo. 20 Shenandoah and Emory & Henry, but dropped a double-header to Hampden-Sydney

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee baseball
team started the week strong, knocking
off the 20th-ranked team in the nation
and sweeping a double-header against
Emory & Henry. But the Generals stum-
bled toward the end of the week, losing
two games to Hampden-Sydney. W&L’s
offensive attack carried it to a 16-1 1 win
over Shenandoah and two wins over
E&H at 18-6 and 7-1. But the bats just
went cold against Hampden-Sydney,
and the Generals lost 6-4 and 3-0.

Facing off against Shenandoah, the
game looked to be a tense, low-scoring
affair. Instead, a total slugfest broke out.
W&L took a 6-1 lead in the third inning,
thanks in part to four Shenandoah er-
rors and a three-run home run by fresh-
man catcher Luke Deary. This outburst
chased Shenandoah starting pitcher Matt
Grifﬁn to the bench, starting a revolving

door of Hornet pitchers for the rest of
the game. Shenandoah had seven differ-
ent players take the mound against the
Generals and none of them had any luck
halting the onslaught.

The Generals used a three-run fourth
inning and a two-run ﬁfth to take an 11-4
lead. Shenandoah would eventually cut
the margin to 1 1-8, but W&L put the nail
in the cofﬁn with a four-run seventh in-
ning to stretch the ﬁnal score to 16-1 1.

The scoresheet was ﬁlled after this
game was over. Senior catcher Will
Lewis, senior ﬁrst baseman Hunter
Serenbetz and ﬁrst-year shortstop Johna-
than Stutts combined for eight hits.
Serenbetz, Lewis, senior third baseman
Jim Plantholt and Deary each had 3 runs
batted in. Do-it-all second baseman, se-
nior John Ditore, scored four times for
W&L.

Back to basics: the
importance of the free throw

It may not be the ﬂashiest shot in the playbook, but good free throw-
shooting can go a long way in the NCAA Tournament

By Adam Cancryn
c o L u M N I sr

Jordan Crawford’s 30-foot three point-
er to force overtime against Kansas State.
Danero Thomas’s off-balance jumper to
beat Vanderbilt. Chris Kramer’s weaving,
left-handed layup to push Purdue into the
Sweet 16. There has been no shortage
of memorable plays in this year’s wild
NCAA Tournament, and more are sure to
come with the ﬁeld whittled down to just
four teams.

But lost among the highlight packages
and made-for-TV moments are the shots
that put these players in position to play
the hero: free throws.

Free throws are often ignored as a ma-
jor element of the game because, quite
frankly, they’re boring. There is no dan-
ger of a free throw getting blocked, no
extraordinary athletic ability required, no
opportunity for the high drama that has
become a staple of college basketball. It’s
just a 15-foot, uncontested set shot.

Yet it is precisely that dull simplicity
that makes these shots so crucial. At the
free throw line, teams’ respective advan-
tages and disadvantages are eliminated.
Size, quickness, 3-point prowess, de-
fensive skill, none of that matters when
a player is on the charity stripe. It’s just
make or miss.

And in close games between evenly
matched teams, everything hinges on
those two possibilities.

Through the Sweet 16 and the ﬁrst clay
of the Elite Eight, seven games were de-
cided by 10 points or less. In six of those
seven, the winning team shot the better
free throw percentage.

Playing for a spot in the Final Four,
Butler was dominated by second-seeded
Kansas State in nearly every aspect of the
game. The Wildcats held the statistical
advantage in shots, turnovers, steals and
blocks, a product of swarming defense
that forced Butler into numerous bad pos-

sessions.
But whenever that defense became a
little too aggressive, the mid-major Bull-

dogs took full advantage. Butler hit 14 of

20 free throws, effectively evening out
the shot disparity. Kansas State, on the

other hand, converted just seven of their
14 attempts. By doubling the number of

made free throws, Butler stayed even
with their more skilled foe, and eventu-
ally pulled out the victory by, not coinci-
dentally, seven points.

In Saturday’s second Elite Eight
match-up, West Virginia took down top-
seeded Kentucky. Though the favorite
had breezed through the early rounds
by virtue of superior size and quickness
at every position, that athleticism didn’t
translate into any kind of competence at
the line. The team converted just 55.2
percent of their free throws, while West
Virginia made seven more shots and com-
piled a better overall percentage (67.6
percent).

Wins by Tennessee and Michigan
State in the Sweet 16 followed the same
pattern. Even the one anomaly, the dou-
ble-OT Sweet 16 classic between Kansas
State and Xavier, hinged on free throw
performance. Though Xavier shot a better
overall clip, the Wildcats converted four
of ﬁve free throw attempts in the game’s
waning moments, maintaining a margin
that forced their opponent to respond
with rushed three-pointers.

Now, free throws are certainly not the
only key to winning basketball games.
Georgia Tech (86.4 percent) and BYU
(83.3 percent) shot well from the line but
could accomplish little else. They both
found themselves so overrnatched that
one statistical advantage could not out-
weigh their numerous shortcomings.

But in more evenly matched contests,
free throws are not just a chance to score,

The next day, the Generals came back
home for a double-header against E&H.
The Wasps were simply outmatched
against a vastly superior W&L team.
In game one, W&L continued its recent
hobby of embarrassing the other team’s
pitchers by exploding for 14 runs in the
ﬁrst four innings.

Serenbetz started the Generals off
with a two-run shot in the bottom of
the ﬁrst inning and things just got better
from there. Nine players had a hit and an
RBI for W&L as they ran the ﬁnal score
up to 18-6.

Lewis was 4-4 with two RBI and
two runs, while Serenbetz ﬁnished 2-4
with three RBIs and two runs. Stutts and
sophomore outﬁelder Mike Decembrino
each added three hits and three RBIs.
Sophomore second baseman Alston
James clubbed a solo homer as well.

but to put the opponent at a defensive
disadvantage. Getting to the line ﬁrst re-
quires getting fouled, a development that
is often more costly than the resulting

points scored.

In West Virginia’s win over Wash-
ington, Huskies star Quincy Pondexter
picked up three quick fouls and played
just seven minutes in the ﬁrst half. He
would not score until after halftime and
ﬁnished with seven total points, far below

his 19.3 points per game average.

Butler neutralized Syracuse standout
Andy Rautins in the same way, forcing
him to foul twice in the ﬁrst half and
limiting his minutes early. As a result,
he never got into rhythm and attempted
just nine shots, eight of which were three-
point shots. He would ﬁnish with four
fouls. Additionally, though Butler is the
worst free-throw shooting team in the
Final Four, their aggressiveness has al-
lowed them to make up for their lack of
eﬁiciency. They have taken, and made,
the second-most free throws of the teams

remaining.

As the toumament’s ﬁnal days ap-
proach, there is no doubt each team will
deliver their own memorable moment,
whether it’s a buzzer beater, a half-court
heave or any one of the limitless ways to

put the ball through the hoop.

But getting to that point, being in posi-
tion to win or lose the game on a single
play, will depend on who takes advantage
of the easy points throughout the game.
The team that makes their free throws

Senior pitcher Chuck Davidson
picked up his ﬁrst win of the season. He
worked ﬁve innings, allowing only ﬁve
runs and eight hits, with ﬁve strikeouts.

Sophomore pitcher Roger Strong
threw six innings and allowed only one
unearned run in the second game against
E&H. He picked up the win and pushed
his record up to 3-0 on the year.

W&L took the lead for good in the
third inning on an RBI single by James,
which broke a. 1-1 tie. James was 2-2
with two walks, two RBIs, and two runs.
Decembrino was 2-3 on the day.

But W&L’s good fortune came to a
screeching halt on Saturday as Hamp-
den-Sydney swept a double-header from
the Generals. HSC built a 6-1 lead going
into the seventh inning. W&L mounted
a mini-rally to make things interest-
ing. RBI hits by Decembrino, Ditore

and sophomore CJ Thompson brought
the score to a 6-4 margin, but Hamp-
den-Sydney would close the door from
there.

Game two was no better. Hampden-
Sydney’s starting pitcher Ryan Daniel
improved his season record to 5-2 after
putting up six shutout innings. The Gen-
erals managed a mere ﬁve hits in this
contest, only three days after hanging a
combined 41 runs on Shenandoah and
E&H.

The end of the week was a disap-
pointment for the Generals, but it’s early
wins were enough to boost the team to a
winning record in ODAC play.

W&L will host Southern Virginia
University on Tuesday. The ﬁrst pitch is
set for 4 p.m.

Carnival comes to town

W&L played host to over I, 000 athletes in home track event this weekend

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

It seemed like everywhere you looked
this weekend, a track athlete wasn’t far
away. They were in the restaurants, shop-
ping downtown, and perusing the Wash-
ington and Lee campus. And they were all
over Wilson Field.

More than 1,000 athletes traveled from
NCAA Division 1, II and 111 schools across

the area to Lexington for the third annual .

W&L Carnival. Competing schools ranged
from ODAC foes like Roanoke College to
MIT and Shippensburg University.

“lt was an awesome turnout,” said
sophomore Dana Fredericks, who com-
peted in the 1,500-meter and 800-meter
events. “We had so many teams, from D1
to Dlll. The weather cleared up so it was a
great day for running. It was an overall fun
day with fast running.”

With so many top-notch athletes ﬂood-
ing the track, the competition for the Gen-
erals was ﬁerce. But thanks to some strong
individual performances, W&L held its
own in its home event.

“There was a lot of really good teams
there... that produced a lot of really strong
performances that could really push you
to get your times down,” said sophomore
Tyler Grant.

Grant set a new school record in the de-
cathlon, putting up a total of 5,777 points.
His all-around track prowess was good
enough for a third-place ﬁnish. Grant was
fast as lightning on the sprints, running
11.91 in the 100-meter dash and 51.63
in the 400-meter dash. He took down the
hurdles with a time of 16.52 in the 110-
meter hurdles and a time of 4:33.31 in the
1,500-meter runs.

Grant was equally as solid in the other
decathlon events, jumping 5.77 meters in
the long jump and 1.62 meters in the high
jump.

On the shot put, Grant threw for 10.29
meters. He heaved the discus 30.64 meters
and the javelin 48.46 meters. Grant vault-
ed for 3.20 meters up in the air during the
pole vault.

“It was my ﬁrst decathlon,” Grant said.
“Ten events over two days. It was exhaust-

W&L sophomore Tyler Grant competes in the 110 meter hurdles

ing but, you know, it was a lot of fun. I was
pleased I was able to ﬁnish. A lot of people
get too tired to ﬁnish... l was pleased to
ﬁnish my ﬁrst one.”

Senior Ben Goetsch transitioned well
from basketball season and earned a third-
place ﬁnish of his own. He jumped 1.85
meters in the high jump.

The men took home two more eighth-
place ﬁnishes in the high jump and the
relay, respectively. Junior David Doobin
jumped 1.75 meters in the high jump and
the 4x400 meter relay team ﬁnished at
3:27.27 for the other eighth place title. The

relay team was composed of seniors Brian
Bondurant and Sean Hurdiss, and ﬁrst-
years Steven Collieu and Wayde Marsh.

‘‘I’m usually on the 4x400, but be-
cause of the decathlon, 1 was off of it,”
Grant said. “They all dropped consider-
ably in their split times to run really fast.
Sean [Hurdiss] had a really strong perfor-
mance.”

First-year Marissa Thompson was a
stud for the women’s team. She took home
ﬁfth-place in the triplejump with a leap of
10.55 meters. In the long jump, she shot
ahead 4.96 meters for a ninth-place ﬁnish.
Thompson rounded out her strong perfor-

mance with a 12.86 dash in the 100-meters
for a sixth place ﬁnish.

Thompson also put her legs to use on
the fourth-place 4x400 meter relay team.
Thompson, senior Sallie Armstrong, soph-
omore Natalie Stie, and senior Maggie
Sutherland ran for 4:12.59.

Sutherland also took home an indi-
vidual victory in the 100-meter hurdles.
She ﬁnished with a time of 16.39 and an
eighth-place title.

On the discus, ﬁrst-year Taylor Maxey
beat out the ﬁeld for a third-place ﬁnish.
She threw for 35.42 meters.

Senior Kat Telfeyan closed out the
women’s top—l0 ﬁnishes with fourth-place
title in the 1,500-meters at 4:50.54.

Both the men’s and women’s teams will
continue their outdoor season this coming
Saturday when they travel to the Liberty
Invitational. Events start at 9:30 a.m.

Redeﬁning
Republicans

Meghan McCain reaches
out to young conservatives

By Eric Gehman
STAFF WRITER

The phrase “Progressive Republican” is not used
often in American politics, but speaker Meghan Mc-
Cain described herself as just that during her presen-
tation last Thursday night in Stackhouse theater.

Speaking on the subject of civility in politics,
McCain discussed the fever pitch of rhetoric in the
media, noting that “incivility is everywhere we turn”
in politics. She decried hyperpartisan talk show hosts
like Glenn Beck and Keith Olbermann for inciting
their audiences to unnecessarily violent outrage.

After her speech concluded, McCain ﬁelded
questions from the audience on her political beliefs,
her work as a blogger at The Daily Beast, and the
future of the Republican party in the wake of sweep-
ing defeat in the 2008 election.

McCain was ardent about the need for conserva-
tives to be more tolerant and accepting of minority
groups like Latinos, African Americans, and Gays.
She expressed a fundamental concern with many
conservatives’ insularity and unwillingness to wel-

come people into the party who have differing views

on issues like gay rights.

As a ‘progressive’ Republican, McCain explained
that she believes out-of-control federal spending to
be the biggest issue facing our generation, but she

“I ’m not saying let is abandon
the core ideas that the Republi-
can party was built on. [Republi-

)

cans] must evolve, or we die. ’

MEGHAN McCAlN, speaker

also supports more liberal ideas like protecting the
environment and supporting gay marriage. As part
of the overarching theme of expanding the conserva-
tive base to encompass more moderate Republicans,
she described herself as a “gun-toting, Jesus-loving
Republican who lives in the West Village” before
asking, “Does that make me a real American, or a
real Republican?”

Ultimately, McCain advocated for moderate Re-

publicans and party minorities to speak out against '

the exclusive, far-right wing of the Republican party
so that other young conservatives will be encour-
aged to involve themselves in the democratic pro-
cess. Citing the energetic youth movement behind
the Obama campaign in 2008, she said that young
Republicans should encourage more pluralism in the
party and keep working to galvanize voters with is-
sues like spending, healthcare reform, and job cre-
ation. '

“I’m not saying let’s abandon the core ideas that
the Republican party was built on,” said McCain.
But she was quick'to add that Republicans “must
evolve, or we die.”

She also discussed the ‘Tea Party’ populism that
has captivated conservative media outlets like Fox
News. McCain said that the Tea Parties are “goodin
theory” because they claim to be protesting federal
spending, but that they “always come down to race.”
She also noted the hypocrisy of their anti-spending
position while they pay speakers like Sarah Palin
hundreds of thousands of dollars in appearance
fees.

McCain also spoke on the subject of new media
and online journalism. As an avid user of Twitter,
Facebook and other social media outlets, she feels
that print journalism is a “dinosaur,” and that politi-
cians will have to adapt to new technologies that help
them reach out to voters. She was widely praised
for her blog that she maintained during her father’s
2008 campaign, but also drew criticism for her more
moderate opinions from right-wing talk radio hosts,
especially a much-publicized ﬂap with conservative
radio host Laura Ingraham.

McCain pointed to Ingraham’s remarks (in which
she called McCain “plus-sized” and a “Valley girl”)
as indicative of the “amped-up”political discourse
and media culture she ﬁnds so troubling.

Kappa Sig to rush
  back to campus

Next fall, the fraternity will recolonize at Washington & Lee after a four-year suspension

By Valaree Tang
STAFF WRITER

The Mu chapter of Kappa Sigma
fraternity will be returning to the
Washington and Lee campus in the
fall.

The colonization efforts will be-
gin in the fall and take place over
the course of the year, with the re-
cruitment of upperclassmen, and
continue through the spring, when
ﬁrst-year students will be recruited.
At that time, recruitment will have
been completed, and the chapter will
be fully established.

The title of Mu chapter has been
reserved for the W&L chapter, and
after re-colonization the chapter will
continue to be operating under the
same name. However, other aspects
ofthe chapter will be re-formed from
scratch.

After completing recruitment, the
re-founding fathers of Kappa Sigma
will undergo orientation and train-

' ing.‘ The group will then fulﬁll a list

of requirements to become a chapter.
such as writing bylaws and develop-
ing a pledge education program that
consists of learning about chapter
meetings, and fulﬁlling a set num-
ber of hours of community service.
The ten-month period typically al-
lotted for a colony to get its charter
is followed up with a ceremony that
is attended by other chapters in order
to conduct the ceremony of chapter
installation.

“Kappa Sigma historically has
been a very strong chapter on the
campus of W&L from what I un-
derstand and from looking back at
records,” said Clay Coleman, Direc-

tor of Campus Activities and Greek
Life. “One appeal to Kappa Sigma is
you can be a re-founding father. An-
other is that they also really want to
do things right.”

Kappa Sigma at W&L was sus-
pended for four years in 2007 af-
ter an investigation that found the
chapter in violation of that national
organization’s code of conduct, and
continued disregard for University
policy.

“The University did not ﬁnd in
its judicial bodies that Kappa Sigma
should be suspended, but Kappa Sig-
ma nationals took it upon themselves.
The national organization punished
them more so than the University.
Now, the University held them ac-
countable. They had two strikes, so
one more and they were gone,” said
Coleman. _

The four-year suspension was de-
termined by Kappa Sigma's national
headquarters, and is unrelated to the
Interfraternity Council (IFC) or the
University. The IFC is composed of
the president of each fraternity on
campus, and an executive council of
otﬁcers. One of the purposes of the
IFC, according to its constitution, is
to “address dilﬁcult issues, confront
inappropriate behavior, and hold
themselves and others accountable.”

“The IFC continues to hold or-
ganizations accountable for acts of
hazing, speciﬁcally organizations
that have been suspended in the past
for behaviors. The IFC as a judicial
conduct body is holding its peers ac-
countable more so than in the past,”

Coleman said.

In 2007, the Kappa Sigma pledge
class _was initiated into Beta Theta
Pi fraternity, which was, at the time,
returning to campus from its suspen-
sion. ‘

Jason Rodocker, the predeces-
sor to Coleman and current Director
of Elrod University Commons and
Campus Activities, advocated the
University using its own sanctions
so that behavior could be corrected
before they suspended the charter,
according to Coleman.

“The University tried to go to bat
for Kappa Sigma to a certain extent,
but they respected the decision be-
cause the national organization had to
uphold their policies as well,” Cole-
man said. “They [Kappa Sigma] are
welcome back to campus whenever
the national organization of Kappa
Sigma determines they can.”

“We received the blessings ofthe
school,” said Mick Wilson Executive
Director of Kappa Sigma Fraternity.
“They have been extremely coopera-
tive and we lookforward to coming
back.”

Wilson believes that the length of
suspension for the Mu chapter was
an “adequate amount of time for us
to serve our time and our penance.
Now, we come back with an entire-
ly new group of men with a fresh
start.”

Kappa Sigma national headquar-
ters will be helping the chapter take
new measures in chapter operations,
including involvement from national
headquarters located in Charlottes-

ville, and meeting with volunteer
alumni from the surrounding area on
how to manage affairs and to offer
counsel.

“I hope that when Kappa Sigma
comes back, they will have the guid-
ance of their national organization
and they aregoing to be able to
structure things and have a really
structured organization that is going
to be committed to not only W&L’s
core values, but also the national
organization’s,” said Coleman, who
hopes that Kappa Sigma will moti-
vate other Greek organizations to get
more involved in their national orga-
nizations.

While Kappa Sigma is anticipat-
ed to have a successful recruitment
next school year, it will not have the
luxury of receiving new members
from a suspended fraternity, as Beta
Theta Pi did in 2007. The expansion
ofthe IFC with the addition of Kappa
Sigma to 15 fraternities at W&L may
also add to the existing problem in
recruitment numbers. said IFC Presi-
dent Lindsay Crawford.

Even so, Wilson believes that the
history of Kappa Sigma fratemity,
coupled with the appeal of the lead-
ership opportunities involved with
re-colonization, will aid in the suc-
cessful recruitment of Kappa Sigma.

Wilson hopes that Kappa Sigma is
re-colonized “in such a fashion that
it brings pride to our fraternity on the
national level, brings pride to W&L,
and brings pride to themselves and to
their families.”

' Washington and Lee alum, who was

the editor of Redbook magazine un-
til recently. Morrison was on campus
this past weekend for her reunion.

Morrison has turned down very
few things in her life and it turn has
accomplished all she ever wanted to,
whilejuggling complicated relation-
ships and a 6-year-old son.

The Jenkintown, Pa. native
graduated from W&L in 1990, and
says that she has always been a hard
worker who operates best under
pressure. Her most recent endeav-
ors include the six-year anniversary
of her position at Redbook and her
memoir on divorce, “Falling Apart
in One Piece: An Optimist’s Journey
Through the Hell of Divorce”, which
hit stores on March 23.

Since she became editor-in-chief
in the summer of 2004, Morrison has
made signiﬁcant progress in remak-
ing the 106-year old magazine that
reaches over 10 million American
women every month. She has made
several moves to modernize the
magazine, regarding its content and
photographs.

“I wanted it to feel more optimis-
tic and relevant, more modern. In
modern 1 don’t mean trying to pick
an outside edge of women who are
having do-it-all lives. I am not try-
ing to help you live your to-do list,
but instead live your to-be list,” says

Morrison.

Although Morrison’s changes
have been focused on not losing
the Redbook readers who have sub-
scribed to the magazine for the past
three decades, she claims she has
not done anything she set out to do
for the magazine. Morrison says
that the ﬁrst part of magazine edit-
ing is the articles and pictures. The
second, which although she ﬁnds the
most interesting, Morrison has yet
to fulﬁll at Redbook, involves target
marketing, positioning a brand, and
seeking new customers.

Prior to becoming the editor-in-

chief at Redbook, Morrison served
as the executive editor at Marie
Claire magazine. Although she was
let go from the magazine, Morrison
says it was time for her to move on,
and she landed the job at Redbook
just six weeks later. However, quick
transitioning was not always the case
for Morrison. ‘
When Morrison graduated from
W&L as a member of the second
class of female students, it took her
three months to ﬁnd a job in New
York. She ﬁnally did, using her con-
tacts from a previous internship at
Mademoiselle. During her time at
W&L, Morrison earned a prestigious
internship, through the American So-
ciety of Magazine Editors. Although
she claimed to cry at her desk a lot
while working for “real live” editors,
her summer in New York led her to
Chris, her ex-husband. “I thought he
was pretty cute and we started a rela-
tionship when I moved to New York

after graduation,” says Morrison.
Dreaming of becoming a maga-
zine editor at the age of seven or
eight, Morrison’s favorite magazine
had always been Mirabella, a wom-
en’s magazine that eventually folded

' in 2000. When Morrison landed a

job at Mirabella after graduation,
she considered it a “piece of luck.”
However, she also says that it was
chance that she was falling in love
with Chris when her career was just
taking off. “I didn’t want to get mar-
ried!” said Morrison.

Morrison’s marriage did not last,
and the divorce turned her life in the
opposite direction. However, her re-
lationship with Chris has been noth-
ing more than friendly, she said, and
the two still care about each other.
Nonetheless, Morrison remained
optimistic through the divorce. “I
thought, how can I make this experi-
ence that I didn’t really want, as easy
as possible?” said Morrison.

This is the basis for Morrison’s
memoir that she describes as a road-
map to resilience. It tells readers how
to cope with divorce and how to use
it as an opportunity to reshape their
life and identity after divorce. This is
different from common thoughts that
are associated with divorce about an-
ger and betrayal.

Morrison said she was also in-
spired to write her memoir because
for a long time now she has been
considered ‘a “relationship and sex
expert.” Her goals have always been
to help American women, “I care
really deeply about people amazing

themselves,” says Morrison. This is
seen throughout her memoir.

The W&Lalumjuggled a lot while
writing her memoir, including ﬁnal-
izing her divorce, managing one of
America’s most popular magazines,
and her six-year old son. Fortunately,
Morrison’s time at W&L helped her
master the art ofmultitasking.

At W&L, Morrison created her
own major which was a mix of
courses in French, business, English
and journalism. She was also co-edi-
tor of the yearbook and worked in
the dining hall.

She claims that she lived it all
at W&L and wouldn’t change one
thing about her experience at the col-
lege. Morrison encouraged students
to take advantage of the great pro-
fessors at W&L. She only took one
class with one of her favorite profes-
sors, but she liked him because his
door was always open. “I always tell
my parents that W&L was worth way
more than they ever paid in tuition,”
laughs Morrison.

So what’s next for the success-
ful alum? She doesn’t know. There
has been talk of Morrison turn-
ing her memoir into a TV show or
movie, but people have already been
requesting another book from her.
“For me, I’m really interested to see
what next, something that I couldn’t
have imagined. I am interested to see
what I haven’t dreamed of that I’ll
do,” she said. More importantly, will
Morrison ever say no to something?

The GOP must choose an identity

: Lincoln or Know-Nothing

Arizona is new, possibly racist legislations puts Republicans at a crossroads that could determine November is elections

By Abel Delgado
co LU M N I ST

Just as the Republican Party
appears to be reforming itself,
with energized activists taking a
stand against the statist policies
oftheir political rivals, GOP leg-
islators in Arizona decided shoot
the party in the foot.

Arizona’s recently passed
immigration legislation, called
SBl070, is inherently un-Ameri-
can, clearly unconstitutional and
downright intolerable to the mil-
lions of Hispanics and other US
citizens whose civil rights are
now legally disregarded.

Now it is time for Republi-
cans to decide whether they are
still the party of Lincoln or want
to warp into the party of Know-
Nothings. -

Remember the Know-Noth
ings? They were the “nativist”
crusaders who wanted to do
away with Irish and German im-
migrants.

Lincoln worried? that if the
Know-Nothings ever came to
power, the Declaration of Inde-

pendence would be read to say
“all men are created equal except
negroes, foreigners and Catho-
lics.”

It is a tragic irony that some
of the descendants of the once-
antagonized Irish and German
communities are now antagoniz-
ing other immigrant communi-
ties.

When a known bigot like Tom
Tancredo says he is concerned
the law will allow for racial pro-
ﬁling, you know it went too far.

What happened to the New
Colossus, the Mother of Exiles?

What happened to being the
land of the free and of equal
opportunity, a land built on the
backs of immigrants?

Proponents of the law say it
is not anti-immigrant, but anti-il-
legal immigration and a response
to all the violence taking place
on the border. But this law will
not help.

If we want to stop illegal im-
migration we must secure the

border with a well-funded and
properly trained National Guard.

We must also stop the illegal
gun trade from the US to Mexico
that is providing the weaponry
for the drug wars.

pend on_ inhumane smugglers to
give credence to Lady Liberty’s
promise.

Let us not kid ourselves: if we
want our economy to keep grow-
ing and our entitlement programs

Let us not kid ourselves; if we want our

economy to keep growing and our entitle-

ment programs to stay solvent, we need

[immigrants] as much as they need us.

We must streamline the mess
we call a legal immigration sys-
tem, so that the countless of
honest, hard-working, freedom-
seeking individuals who will
do anything for the well-being
of their families do not have to
break the law to have a chance
at the American Dream and de-

to stay solvent, we need them as
much as they need us.

This law also gives every
tan-skinned, Spanish-speaking
American citizen a cause for
concern and any believer in the
Constitution a cause for disgust.
Article 1, Section 8 of the Con-
stitution states that the US Con-

gress has the power to “establish
an uniform Rule of Naturaliza-
tion.” If Arizona police have the
obligation to determine the legal
status of anybody who causes
“reasonable suspicion” but po-
lice in other states do not have
the power, how is that uniform?

There’s also the fact that
American citizens can cause
“reasonable suspicion” just by
walking down the street and be
arrested for not carrying ID.

If Juan Rodriguez has to carry
ID on him at all times but John
Roberts does not, then this vio-
lates the equal protection clause
of the 14th Amendment.

It disturbs me that some of
those who rightfully worry about
the un-constitutional nature of
an individual mandate for health
care turn a blind eye to the un-
constitutional nature of SBlO70.
Should we only follow the Con-
stitution when we see ﬁt?

It befuddles the mind that
some of the GOP old guard still

think using hate and fear is the
best way to win elections. This is
what defeated the party in 2006
and 2008. '

If Republicans win in 2010, it
will be because of reformers like
Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio, not
hate-mongers like the Arizona
legislatures.

Every great Republican lead-
er, from Lincoln to Regan, was a
reformer who valued the Ameri-
can Dream.

Now it is time for Repub-
Iicans to prove they still know
something about what that dream
means.

Bringing Muhammad to South Park not the smartest move

Tim McAleenan explains both sides of the controversy of showing Muhammad is image on a recent ‘South Park’

By Tim McA|eenan
C0 LUM N I ST

Matt Stone and Trey Parker,
“ the creators of Comedy Central’s
South Park cartoon series, re-
cently stirred up‘ a controversy
with their two-part series last
week depicting the Muslim
prophet Muhammad in an unﬂat-
tering light.

Theirjoke wasn’t all that fun-
ny: it involved a man in a bear
costume standing before a large
audience, when, all ofa sudden...
(drum roll please)... the bear cos-
tume came offto reveal Muham-
mad. By South Park standards,
this does not even come close
to being offensive, especially
when compared to their regular
depiction of gays, minorities,
“gingers,” priests in the Catho-
lic Church, Moses, Jesus, Jews,
Buddha or the pope.

You would think more peo-
ple would be bothered by the
fact that the only black kid in
the class is named “Token,” but
yet, our friends at the New York
Times have yet to write even a
single article about South Park’s
treatment of black characters,
gingers, or Jesus speciﬁcally
(that is, until this past week), but
yet, they have 7,320 articles on
the South Park/Muhammad con-
troversy (counting NY Ti1nes-af-
filiated blogs).

Comedy Central decided to‘

censor the two-part series when
Stone and Parker began receiv-
ing death threats shortly after the

episodes aired. Abu Talhah Al-
Amrikee, who by no means ﬁts
the W&L deﬁnition of a “hang-
out guy,” blasted Stone and Park-
er on his website revolutionmus-
lim.com, which, as you might be
surprised to learn, is not exactly
a website dedicated to Gandhi’s
peaceful-protesting style.
Al-Amrikee pointed out that
the Qur’An clearly and forcibly
forbids the depiction of Muham-

and Dutch Muslim extremists)
shot him eight—EIGHT!—times
and then stuck two knives in Van
Gogh’s torso, along with a ﬁve-
page note explaining why he was
killed. Bouyeri then tried to roll
Van Gogh’s bo'dy down the street
at around 3 AM—a starry night,
indeed.

And what did Van Gogh do to
provoke this? He ﬁlmed a docu-
mentary titled “Submission” that

As a word of advice, I would try and reﬂain

from making any statement that would make

you feel the need to ﬁnish withithe line ‘this is

mad, and he had this to say, “It’s
outright insulting... We have to
‘warn Matt and Trey that what
they are doing is stupid, and they
will probably wind up like Theo
van Gogh for airing this show.
This is not a threat.”
Al-Amrikee was alluding to
the 2004 death ofTheo van Gogh,
who lost more than an car when
Mohammed Bouyeri ofthe Hofs-
tad terrorist group (North African

suggested that the generic “Mus-
lim culture” is not exactly known
for treating its women like prin-
cesses. But I guess we shouldn’t
be too concerned about what
Al-Amrikee had to say, since
he added the line “this is not a
threat” at the end. '

As a word of advice, I would
try and refrain from making any
statement that would make you
feel the need to ﬁnish with the

line “this is not a threat.” It’s
right up there with beginning
a statement by saying, “No of-
fense, but. . .”

And Amrikee points out that
the Qur’An ﬂat-out rejects any
notion of humor regarding re-
ligion. That’s true enough+we
don’t typically confuse Qur’An
passages with punchlines from
Saturday Night Live.

He cites Surah 6, Verse 70 of
the Qur’An which tells believers
to “avoid those who take their re-
ligion as playing and an amuse-
ment and ‘are seduced by the life
of this world... for them a drink
of boiling water, a stern punish-
ment for their disbelief.” Well,
that’s a nice image.

At this point, I think Am-
rikee is just giving Stone and
Parker more ammo for their next
episode. They’Il probably show
Cartman being forced to consume
boiling water, and he’ll end up
putting eggs in his mouth while
the other kids try to paint them
into Easter eggs. I don’t know,
but I am sure we can expect both
Parker and Stone to caricature
those in the Muslim community
and at the New York Times who
have reacted so strongly to their
recent episodes.

But to be fair to the Muslims,
they do have some legitimate
grievances. Much like the ﬁrst-
ﬂoor printer that the “green”
people have apparently taken

over, there are two sides to this
story. .

A lot of Muslims have been
making the argument that just
because you have the right to be
offensive, it doesn’t mean you
should. If you understand that
Muslims do not appreciate de-
pictions of Muhammad, why in-
sist on insulting them? It doesn’t
seem like gentlemanly behav-
ior, they would certainly argue.
I doubt any of us could picture
Robert E. Lee telling “So Mu-
hammad and ﬁfty virgins walked
into a bar” jokes.

Muslim leaders have pointed
out that Americans don’t go
around burning American ﬂags
in front of WWII veterans, uri-
nating on Cruciﬁxes in front of
priests or telling Holocaust jokes
in front of Jews.

So why do this to the Muslim
community? First of all, I don’t
think the South Park/Muhammad
controversy is even in the same
universe as the other three ex-
amples—let’s keep in mind that
it was only Muhammad wearing
a bear suit, and television broad-
casts certainly don’t have the
personal element that the other
three examples contain.

Plus, Americans generally
don’t appreciate fear and in-
timidation tactics. The reason
people don’t burn ﬂags, urinate
on the cross or tell Holocaust
jokes is out of respect or rever-

Whether or not to pitch the Spring Term Option

Is it responsible to take four weeks 0]?’ of school and work if you don ’t have to take a class? Stockton Bullitt thinks so

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

When I ﬁrst heard about the
Spring Term Option, I thought of
my mom.

See, when I was a little kid,
I had a similar work ethic to the
one I have in college. That is, I
did as little as possible for me to
not get into trouble. ‘

My mom, whose hard-work-
ing genes did not pass onto me,
would occasionally explain, “I ‘m
working x number of hours a
week just so you can sit at home
and play video games? C’mon!”
Around that time, I would usu-

». ally scurry to my backpack and
‘diligently try to look like I was ‘

hard at work.

Anyway, this vision kept re-
playing in my head whenever I
would talk to seniors taking their
Spring Option. I couldn’t see
how their parents weren’t berat-
ing them with phone calls yell-
ing, “I’m paying $50,000 a year
for you to do nothing?!”

For those who don’t know,
Spring Term Option is a way
to avoid taking classes during

Spring Term without getting into
trouble.

Now, I know that Spring Term
Option is primarily used for stu-
dents who want to start their in-
ternships a little early. Let’s just
forget about those students. They
are the malicious overachievers

taking their Spring Temi Option
are all obviously ﬁnished with
their graduation requirements
and therefore do not need to take
a class they don’t want to take.

’ I also know that Spring Term
Option has been around for a
while, but with spring term’s

that they could not imagine hav-
ing to sit through. I don’t have
the statistics to back this up,
but it seems like there are many
more seniors opting for a spring
term full of relaxed tanning than
before.

Although I didn’t have a real

problem with it, I really couldn’t
see how so many students could
simply get away with an extra
four-week vacation. I kept look-
ing at the situation as a failure
on the registrar’s fault: they let
down the students by not creat-

ing enough interesting classes for
the four-week spring term.

This is why I was so willing '

to take all the cheap shots I could
at the registrar in the last issue.

I was ﬁrm in my opinion un-
til alumni weekend. Whenever
I would get into a conversation
with an alum over the weekend,
all of them had the same piece of
general advice: “Appreciate this
while you can.” .

When they would roam around
the dorms, houses or classrooms,
the alumni only seemed to re-
member a couple of detail-s: a
dumb, adventurous action taken
by themselves or a friend, how
the scenery has changed since
graduation and only a few special
classes taken while at school.

I know that these memories
do not seem especially impor-
tant, but they did help me switch
my opinion on Spring Term Op-
tion. With only four weeks of
school left before graduation, the
seniors taking their Spring Term
Option are maximizing the num-

ence — they cherish the symbol
of America and Jesus Christ, and
they feel empathy with the hor-
rors of WWII, so why would
anyone go around debasing ob-
jects or symbols they respect?

But the American culture, as
a whole, does not respect cer-
tain tenets of Islam. And the no-
tion that we should refrain from
criticism out of fear of retaliation
from Muslim extremists cannot
be put on the same level with
why we refrain from foully de-
picting the American ﬂag, Jesus,
or the Holocaust.

For the time being, I think
we should focus on Parker and
Stone’s safety. Obviously, out
there in California, they don’t
have room in their Enron-like
budgets to give Parker and Stone
the protection they need.

Therefore, I’m hoping Presi-
dent Ruscio will extend an invi-
tation for them to come to Lex-
ington and shoot the next couple
of seasons here, just to be on the
safe side.

After all, with our two cop-
cars to one student ratio, there
could hardly be a safer place in
the country for them to go.

And if .the local cops had to
worry about Muslim extrem-
ists raining down on our parade,
maybe they’d be less concerned
about nailing that freshman who
blew——GASP!— a .03.

ber of important memories they
can gather.

Instead of wasting a couple of
hours sitting through a class that
they won’t remember ﬁve min-
utes after taking the ﬁnal, they are
completing their last requirement
by spending four weeks making
sure that all the dumb adventures
they can have while in Lexington
are properly accomplished be-
fore graduation.

With that in mind, maybe the
Spring Term Option has a point.
Maybe my mom would approve
of taking four weeks to stretch
out before entering the game of

I real life. And maybe the registrar

knows more than I thought they
did. Well, maybe.

Declaring independence from tyranny

An inherently corrupt system, the new Spring Term needs to be reviewed

By Katherine Roberts
C O PY E D I T O R

When in the course of human
events it becomes necessary for
one student body to dissolve the
academic bands which have con-
nected them with a newly revised
term in the school year and to
assume among the powers of the
earth, the separate and equal sta-
tion to which the Laws of Nature
and of Nature’s God entitle them,
a decent respect to the opinions of
mankind requires that they should
declare the causes which impel
them to the separation.

Below are excerpts from the
Declaration for a return to Old
Spring Term, which we found ly-
ing around in the Commons.

Side note: is there a spring
term class on re—creating the
Revolutionary War?

We hold these truths to be
self-evident, that all students
are created equal, that they are
endowed by Robert E. Lee with
certain‘ unalienable Rights, that
among these are Life, Liberty and
the pursuit of Happiness. ..

The history of the present
Spring Term is a history of re-
peated injuries and usurpations,
all having in direct object the

establishment of an absolute
Tyranny over these students. To
prove this, let Facts be submitted
to a candid world.

It has called together student
bodies at times unusual, uncom-

It has erected a multitude of
Hard Classes, and sent hither
swarms of work to harass our peo-

It has combined with others to
subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign
to our Constitution, and unac-
knowledged by our laws; giving
its assent to its acts of pretended
legislation...

It has plundered our seas,

ravaged our coasts, burnt our
towns and destroyed the lives of
our people.

It is at this time transporting
large armies of foreign merce-
naries to complete the works of
death, desolation and tyranny,
already begun with circumstances-
of Cruelty & Perﬁdy scarcely
paralleled in the most barbarous
ages, and totally unworthy the
head ofa civilized university.

It has constrained our Fellow
Students taken captive on the
High Seas to go abroad instead
of being here.

It has excited domestic insur-
rections amongst us, and has en-
deavoured to bring on the inhabit-
ants of our frontiers, the merciless
Indian Savages whose known rule
of warfare, is an undistinguished
destruction of all ages, sexes and
conditions.

In every stage of these Op-
pressions we have petitioned for
redress in the most humble’term_s:
Our repeated petitions have been
answered only by" repeated injury.
A Term, whose character is thus
marked by every act which may
deﬁne a Tyrant, is unﬁt to be the
ruler of a free student body.

Hell in Lexington: slow Internet

Video streaming and Internet speed has slowed down in recent months

By Dane Davis
COLUMNIST

At ﬁrst I thought it was me.
Well, my computer to be exact.
During ﬁnals week, the Internet
on campus slowed to a halt.

My e-mail was down peri-
odically and sometimes websites
would refuse to load. Perhaps, I
thought, my computer was out of
date. Yet when I returned home,
I was shocked to ﬁnd that the
problem lied not with my com-
puter, but with Washington and
Lee’s Internet network. Simple,
short Youtube videos which took
minutes to load here in Lexington
loaded in mere seconds on my
Internet connection at home. For
someone who lives in Ohio, it is
quite depressing that my Internet

connection in the dour Midwest
was superior to that of an elite
and expensive private school.

Upon returning to campus
for spring term, I found that the
Internet problems persist. Video,
streaming or otherwise, is chop-
py and slow. When I attempted
to watch a baseball game, I could
watch the game faster over my
phone than on my computer.

Let us be frank. The Internet
services at W&L are subpar for
the price we pay as students.
Compared to other college cam-
puses, W&L has an inferior Inter-
net network. The thing is, I don’t
remember it being this slow and
intermittent a few short years

ago. With the rise of video web
applications, bandwidth is ever
more necessary to the smooth use
of the Intemet’s full potential.

Within the pages of this
newspaper, others have already
brought to the attention of In-
formation Technology Services
inadequacies in various areas of
student computing. The Internet,
as the backbone of student com-
puting, should receive priority in
upgrades and attention.

Unless action is taken now,
this problem is going to get
worse. Youtube and Hulu are not
going away anytime soon. W&L

In addition, a comprehen-

As it stands now, the univer-

expect. With the right attention
and involvement by the com-
munity, we can all rectify this
problem.

CSS recognizes campus leadership

Celebrating Student Success Committee picks students each month to honor for campus contributions, achievements

By Findley Merrit
smrr wamzn

Celebrating Student Success
honors two students this month
for their contributions to the
Washington and Lee community.

Senior Neville Fogarty and
Junior Cristina Bratu received
this award for May, and will be
honored at a reception in the
Commons Living room at 2 p.m.
on Wednesday.

Student Coordinator Grace
McGee explained that CSS is an
initiative that seeks to recognize
student achievement and contri-
bution to the W&L community,
especially where it is often over-
looked.

“Neville and Cristina were
selected by the CSS committee
because of the depth and breadth
of their impact to the W&L com-
munity and campus life,” said
McGee.

It is an award given each
month to a male and female stu-

dent who are ﬁrst nominated by
someone in the W&L communi-
ty and then selected by the CSS
committee. Anyone may nomi-
nate any student at any time.

“This is what makes CSS
such a unique award, because
the nominations come directly
from the community of people
whom the recipients impact,”
said McGee.

Fogarty, a double major in
economics and math, founded
The Washingtones, a co-ed a
cappella group on campus. '

He is the section leader for
chamber singers and works with
Music Ministry for Catholic
Campus Ministries.

“lt’s like the Catholic RUF,”
Fogarty explained.

He also teaches Sunday school
at St. Patrick’s Catholic Church,
writes crossword puzzles for the
Ring-Tum Phi and serves as an

Assistant Head Residential Ad-
visor in Gaines.
But out of his laundry list of

for economies and is a member
of four different honor societies
including Phi Beta Kappa.

“What CSS hopes to shed light on are the ways

in which students can enhance our

experience at W&L—that each students

involvement, Fogarty takes pride
most in founding The Wash-
ingtones during his sophomore
yeah
“I put in a lot of me,” he said.
On the academic side, Fogar-
ty received the Gunn Scholarship

“I ean’t list their full names
because I get Greek dyslexia,”
joked Fogarty.

Bratu is also a member of Phi
Beta Kappa and on the Dean’s
List.

The economics major is a

member of ESOL, has a radio
show on WLUR every week,
peer tutors, is involved in the
new microﬁnance group, the
General Development Initiative
and a is member of the German
Club.

She works in the Lenfest
Center box office, and next year
she’ll be the co-chair of the Lit
Campaign program.

But Bratu, hailing from Ro-
mania, is most proud of her sta-
tus as an international student at
Washington and Lee.

“I have managed to get to a
point where I can say, hey, may-
be this is the place for me...I
actually do belong to this strange
place, despite the fact that I’m
from a far-away land that has
nothing to do with this one,” she
said.

Bratu received a Johnson Op-
portunity Grant last summer to

do an internship in Germany, and
she received a Student Summer
Independent Research grant this
year for research in Romania.

She is currently abroad in
Germany.

McGee explained that Bratu
and Fogarty were not selected
solely on their resumes.

“That students like Cristina
and Neville are inﬂuential at
W&L is an understatement,” she
said. “What CSS hopes to shed
light on are the ways in which
students can enhance our expe-
rience at W&L—that each stu-
dent’s success is, in some mea-
sure, our own success, and that is
cause for celebration.”

CSS will host the End-of-Year
Event, where various awards like
the Decade Award and the Un-
sung General Award will be pre-
sented, on May 16 at 7 p.m. in
Stackhouse Theater.

Derby Days games supportcharity

Annual Sigma Chi event supports Children ’s Miracle Network, sororities battle each other for champion is‘ title

By Lizz Dye and
Stephanie Hardiman
STAFF WRITER

ARTS & LIFE EDITOR

Women wearing jerseys with
their respective Greek names are
a sure sign that spring has ﬁnally
arrived and Sigma Chi Derby
Days have begun.

The event’s main goal is to
raise money for Sigma Chi’s
national philathropy, Children’s
Miracle Network.

But in past years, the event,
which takes place at the Pole
houses, has come under ﬁre for
unnecessary roughness in the
powder puff games that have
left women with broken limbs
and teeth. Complaints of favorit-
ism and a lack of visible points
and rules have also plagued the
event.

This year, Washington and
Lee’s Panhellenic Council had a
list of requests it wanted imple-
mented to make the event more
enjoyable and fair for the women
participating.

Panhel requested a visual
scoreboard, a tangible copy of the
schedule and how to earn points,

referees for powder puff football
provided by Campus Recreation
and a $2 per head registration fee
for each person entered, which
would go to charity. '

Sigma Chi President Brian
Keegan and Vice President Greg
Bekiaris said they worked to-
gether this year to enforce these
changes. ’

But some students are still
calling foul on the games.

Hannah Muther, Pi Beta Phi’s
vice president of member devel-
opment, said that it was obvious
that sober campus referees were
not used.

“It’s in the best interest of ev-
eryone in Panhellenic that this is
done fairly and for the primary
motive of serving a charity,” said
Muther.

Many powderpuff players
were scratched or bruised by the
conclusion of the games.

Bekiaris emphasized that the
goal for Derby Days is to shift
the focus from the more social

aspects of the event back to phi-
lanthropy. He says that Derby
Days “is a philanthropic event
with social aspects” and the so-
cial aspects are what make the

as its national charity. The event
hinges upon sorority participa-
tion and is driven by the dedica-

tion of mostly ﬁrst-year sorority

women during the week.

“Its in the best interest of everyone in Pan-
hellenic that this is done fairly and for the

primary motive of serving a charity. ”

Hannah Muther, Pi Beta Phi V.P. Member Development
 

different events more competi-
tive and successful as a whole.

Derby Days is a philanthropic
event hosted by Sigma Chi chap-
ters across the nation, which
originally began in 1933 at the
University of Califomia-Berke-
ley’s Sigma Chi chapter.

In 1992, Sigma Chi selected
the Children’s Miracle Network

The schedule for Derby Days
began on Monday with a tricy-
cle race betweent the sororities’
coaches, a new event this year.
Sigma Chi decided to include a‘
tricycle race this year because
members recognized that they
ask a lot of the women partici-
pating, and they wanted to en-
courage fraternity members to

get involved and contribute to
the event.

Tuesday included relay races
and ﬁeld games, including dizzy
bat, greasy watermelon, tug of
war, egg in spoon races and a
water balloon toss, as well as a
banner competition.

On Wednesday there was a
cook-off at the Sigma Chi house
and food was judged on presen-
tation, taste, drinks and desserts.
Sigma Chi had planned on hav-
ing a concert featuring Mike
Posner at the Pavillion that eve-
ning; however, it was cancelled
in order to donate more money to
the Children’s Miracle Network.

On Thursday powderpulf
games began in which ﬁrst-year

' members of sororities competed

against each other.

Friday was the powderpuff
ﬁnals with teams ranked on their
perfonnance from the day be-
fore. Following the powderpuff
football ﬁnals were skits put on
by the different sororities. Each

event had a corresponding num-
ber of points awarded to the so-
rority that comes in ﬁrst, second,
third and fourth, which were out-
lined in a handout given to each
sorority.

For the sororities that came
in ﬁrst in certain events, such as
the relay races, powderpuff foot-
ball, the banner contest and the
cook—off, $500 was donated to
the Children’s Miracle Network
in their name by the Sigma Chi
Zeta Chapter. A

When the ﬁnal results came
in, Kappa Kappa Gamma came
in ﬁrst, Chi Omega second, Al-
pha Delta Pi third and Pi Beta
Phi fourth.

Smoking tunes for steamy spring

Washington and Lee is only campus radio station handpicks the freshest batch of new music to tickle your earbuds

By WLUR Staff
STAFF WRITER

We return with advice on how
to navigate the endless-stream of
new independent music and find
the very best of the bunch:

Sharon Jones &
The Dap-Kings
I Learned the Hard Way
(Daptone)

Another piece of “Daptone
Gold” from the Brooklyn label,
Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings
give us a beautiful record of spirit
and soul. Fully engrossed in the
classic sounds of Muscle Shoals
and Stax, Jones and her band ﬁnd
a way to make soul sound fresh
and new. “The Game Gets Old”
kicks things off at a moderate
pace before the record speeds up
and slows down in swell propor-
tion. F ans of Aretha and Mavis,
check out the Sam Cooke-style
“Mama Don’t Like My Man”
and the stellar “I Learned the
Hard Way.” A glorious record.

Roky Erickson with
Okkervil River
True Love Cast Out All Evil
(ANTI-)

We think it is best described
by the group’s label, ANTI-, also
home to Neko Case, Dr. Dog, Os
Mutantes, and Tom Waits:

loss. With a wisdom that can
only be marshaled by someone
who has been through all of this,
Erickson also interjects the songs
with love, hope, and spiritual
grace.

“While True Love Cast Out
All Evil echoes the many musi-
cal styles in which Erickson has
been a participant or a pioneer

psych, heavy metal and country-

Erickson into new territory, fore-
grounding his songwriting skill.

3 -on-3 basketball tourney for charities

By Randi Wilson
STAFF wrmsn

This Saturday the 4th Annual
3-on-3 Charity Basketball Tour-
nament will take place at David-
son Park.

Hosted by Pi Beta Phi and
Sigma Phi Epsilon, it is an event
intended to promote gender rela-
tions on campus.

Keaton Fletcher, a first-year
and Sig Ep chairman of the tour-
nament, said that one of the main
purposes of the games is to foster
“interactions in a safe, sober envi-
ronment” between the sexes.

_ And while there won’t be any
alcohol, pizza and other refresh-
ments will be included with the
entrance fee, which is $15 per 3-
person team.

As an added beneﬁt, multiple
outstanding charities will receive
all money raised for the touma-
ment. V

YouthAids, Sig Ep’s national
charity, First Book, one of Pi
Phi’s national charities and the Pi
Phi Foundation will be receiving
almost all of the funds, helped by
sponsorships from Campus Activ-
ities, Multicultural Students As-
sociation, Gay/Straight Alliance,
l-in-4 and a few local shops.

Brittany Tomkies, Pi Phi’s phi-
lanthropy chair, said that most of
the revenue comes from entrance
fees and T-shirt sales. Shirts are
$15, but cost only $12 for those
entering teams.

Some of the donations will
help offset the costs of prizes for
the 3-point shooting and foul shot
winners, and champions of each
bracket.

Teams can sign up to play in
either a free-style, more of a just-

for-fun bracket, or a competitive ‘

bracket. Both will compete in
a half-court single-elimination
“March Madness” knockout style,
said Tomkies.

In the free-style bracket,
Fletcher said that “outlandish
costumes are highly encouraged,”
and that prizes are given for the
best-dressed group.

Last year’s costume contest
winners included sophomore

Katherine Roberts.

“Team Stegosaurus” was ini-
tially her idea, she said, but team
member Allison Chopin, ajunior,
designed the costumes in a Land
Before Time fashion.

Roberts was Little Foot, Cho-
pin was Chomper, and sophomore
Josh Posner was Spike.

Dressed in decorated T-shirts
with green foam spikes as head-
gear, Team Stegosaurus easily
overshadowed their competition,
which included Team Tasmanian
Devils and Team Jane Fonda.

The actual basketball game
didn’t go quite as well.

“Although we played with en-
thusiasm,” Roberts said, the “high
point” was definitely the one bas-
ket scored by Chopin.

But the games are just as much
a social as an athletic function.

Christina Torres, a junior, com-
peted in the competitive bracket
her freshman year. Her team only
played one game as well.

“You don’t have to be good” in
order to have a good time, Torres
said.

Eating pizza, listening to mu-
sic and catching up with friends
are - all part of the toumament’s
appeal

Torres also said she hopes “to
see people just supporting the
other teams.”

Even some W&L staff are get-
ting involved in the tournament.

The Art Department is planning
on entering a team to compete,
and the Math Department will ei-
ther be competing or sponsoring a
team, according to Tomkies.

The tournament will take place
at l p.m. on Saturday at the Da-
vidson Park basketball court. The
rain location is Doremus Gym at
4:30 p.m.

Entertainment for the ﬁrst half

of the day will be provided by
bands including The Drew Martin
Band, KC and the Joneses, Deli-
cious on Purpose, Rikki Tikki
_Tavi, Michael Morella and Scotty
Groth.

DJ Levitown will mix until the
tournament wraps up.

All those interested in playing
can register this week in the com-
mons from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., and
can swipe it home. Shirts won’t be
ready for pick-up until Thursday.
Teams can register until Friday,
and T-shirts can also be purchased
at the tournament.

In these songs, Erickson address-
es his troubled history in his own

 

words, eschewing the metaphors
of earlier songs like “I Walked
with a Zombie” to speak directly
about hardship and the lessons
learned from it. Will Sheff’s
production highlights the songs
while interweaving them with
found-sound and archival re-
cordings culled from Erickson’s
home videos and recordings
made in the Rusk State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane.

“This is not a cynical come-
back record, a lukewarm update
on an established legacy — these
are the best songs Roky has ever
written, unreleased due to de-
cades of personal problems.”

We wanted to write our own
review of this record, but we
can’t top that one, so we’ll sim-
ply expound on it. This is one
of the best and most significant

releases of 2010. It’s amazing
to think that someone who has
had such a tough life could still
make art this beautiful and mov-
ing. It’s also not what you might
have expected from the “found-
ing father of psychedelic rock;”
True Love Cast Out All Evil is
deﬁnitely a Texas country-rock
record—hence the sensible, ex-
cellent decision to enlist the help
of Sheff and Okkervil River.
Check out “Goodbye Sweet
Dreams,” “Bring Back the Past,”
“Be and Bring Me Home” and
the title track.

MGMT
Congratulations (Columbia)

 

MGMT’s 2008 debut, 0racu-
lar Spectacular, quickly pro-
pelled the band to stardom.
“Kids” and “Electric Feel” had
great crossover appeal, and
“Weekend Wars” and “The
Youth” were pretty solid jams,

too. But without looking, can
you name a single track from the
second half of that LP? Didn’t
think so.

 

For the follow-up, Ben Gold-
wasser and Andrew Van Wyn-
garden have made their ﬁrst re-
ally good album. It’s consistent
from start to ﬁnish, yet it also
may not be what you expect
from MGMT. The band is less
reliant on electro-pop ﬂourishes,
focusing more on psychede-
lia—which, while not neces-
sarily prevalent, was certainly
noticeable throughout Oracular
Spectacular. That’s not to say
there aren’t any danceable num-
bers or catchy singles (go right
to “Flash Delirium” and then to
“Brian Eno”), but when the band
launches into a 12-minute, Pink
Floyd-inspired jam like “Sibe-
rian Breaks,” it makes sense in
the context of the record as a

whole. The band has hit its target
on Congratulations; now, the big
question is if they’ll reel in the
casual fans who swayed along to
“Kids.”

The Tallest Man on Earth
The Wild Hunt (Dead
Oceans)

The Wild Hunt is the sec-
ond album from lovely Swed-
ish folksinger Kristian Mattson,
a.k.a. The Tallest Man on Earth.
Here’s what the promoter has to
say: “The Wild Hunt picks up
where [previous record] Shal-
low Grave left off, with Mattson
doing what he does best. It is
unmistakably The Tallest Man
on Earth, from the,urgent strums
of ‘You’re Going Back’ and the
sweet melodies of ‘Love is All,’
to the playful lyricism of live
favorite ‘King of Spain’ and the
subtle hook on ‘Burden of To-
morrow.’ The Wild Hunt isn’t just
another folk album; this is acous-
tic rock’n’roll from a man with a
story to tell.”

Like a Swedish version of
Deer Tick, The Tallest Man on
Earth belts it out with strangled
vocal chords and seductive sin-
cerity.

W&L defeats rival Randolph-Macon in ﬁrst round of the ODAC tournament

By Henri Hammond-Paul
smrr wnnsre

The fourth-seeded Washington and
Lee men’s lacrosse team opened the
ODAC tournament with a 12-6 win over
conference rival Randolph—Macon.

Senior attackman Will Keigler led
the Generals’ offense with two goals and

one assist. In the process, he recorded
his hundredth career goal and upped his
career scoring total to 211 points (101
G, 110 A), good enough to place sixth
on W&L’s all-time list.

Mac Means, both ﬁrst-years, chipped in
two goals apiece. Junior midﬁelder Mark
Wachtrneister and ﬁrst-year Luke Hein-
son also notched two points each. Scott
Meehan, Luke Walter, Logan Bartlett,
Chris Washington, and Joe LaSala all
had one goal apiece. ,

The Generals (ll-5, 4-3 in the
ODAC) were stuck at a stalemate
with Randolph—Macon (7-8, 3-4 in the
ODAC) deep into the ﬁrst period. The
score remained even at 2-2 despite dom-
inating offensive play that saw W&L
outshoot the Yellow Jackets 26-7 in the
ﬁrst half. But a seven-goal run over the
next three periods ended any doubt of

the outcome, allowing W&L to coast ~

into the next round.

En route to the victory, the Gener-
als controlled every major aspect of the
game,’ outshooting Randolph—Macon
52-14, winning 40 ground balls to the
Yellow Jackets’ 16, taking 14 out of 21
total face-offs and successfully making
15 of 16 clears.

In what has become a staple of its
play this season, W&L’s defense made
the win possible with outstanding and
unforgiving play. The defense forced
Randolph—Macon into 17 turnovers and
allowed just 14 shots throughout the
whole game. Senior goalie Matt Ma-
son made six saves, backing a back line
ranked seventh in the nation in goals al-
lowed per game, with 6.2.

W&L tennis teams fall, 6-3 at CMU

White, Becht are bright spots for the men, while Brzeski and Snyder. lly wins for the women 3 team

By Jayna Johns
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s men’s and
women’s -tennis teams both endured
tough 6-3 losses in Saturday matches at
Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh, Pa.

In its ﬁrst match since being crowned
the 2010 ODAC Champions, the No.
25 men’s’ team faced 8th-ranked CMU,
with all victories coming from ﬁrst-year
Hayden White, recipient of ODAC’s
Rookie of the Year award and sopho-
more Jeremy Becht. t

From the doubles portion ofthe com-
petition, White and Becht teamed to de-
feat their opponents 8-4. It was one of
the more decisive matches of the day
for the men. The No. 1-seeded team of

sophomore Jonathan Gaffney and senior
Alex Brooke could not pull out their
match, falling 9-7. The third—seeded
team, Will Hall and Mac Davis, fell 8-6
in another close match.

In the singles competition, W&L re-
ceived victories at the No. 1 and 2 spots.
White came back from a close lst set
and a 2nd set slump to win his match 7-
6, 1-6, 6-2. Becht then pulled out a solid
6-3, 6-3 victory.

Senior Cliff Gaddy took his oppo-
nent to the limit before succumbing in
the third set After dropping his ﬁrst set
to the close score of 7-5, he pulled out a
6-2 win in the second set. The third went

all the way to 8-8 before his opponent
pulled away, winning 10-8. Junior Will
Hall also lost a close ﬁrst set, 7-5, before
falling in the second set 6-2. '

The match concluded the men’s reg-
ular season, as they ﬁnished with a 15-8
overall record. '

The women’s team also won the 2010
ODAC Championship last weekend, its
20th in 25 years of ODAC competition.
It is also the ninth°consecutive title for
W&L.

The women came into the match
ranked sixth in the nation, with CMU
not far behind at No. 10. Similar to the
men’s games, the women recorded one

doubles victory and two singles victo-
ties.

The doubles team of sophomores
Lauren Lukas and Ann Morris fought
their way to a close 9-7 victory while
senior Lauren Caire and sophomore El-
len Yeatman slipped to a 8-3 loss. The‘
sophomore and senior team of Trelsie
Sadler and Blair Brezeski_ also came up
short, losing 9-8 in the closest match of
the day.

But Brezeski found redemption with
a 6-3, 3-0 victory singles victory. Soph-
omore Jen Snyder took W&L’s second
win with a 7-6, 7-6 victory.

The women’s tennis team also ﬁn-

ished their regular season with this
match, ending with an 18-5 record.
Both men’s and women’s teams will
be back in action on May 14, when
they begin playing in the ﬁrst round of

j the NCAA Division III Toumament at

a location to be determined. They each
earned the trip to Nationals through
the automatic bid provided by winning
ODACs. ‘

Odds stacked against QB Tebow

Brones ’newest star must overcome history, position battles to thrive in NFL

By Adam Cancryn
SPORTS EDITOR
The collective jaw of the football-
watching world dropped when the Den-
ver Broncos selected Tim Tebow with
the 25th pick in the NFL Draft.
Projected as a second-round talent at
best, Tebow instead became the second
quarterback taken overall, vaulting over

»a number of higher-rated, NFL-ready

prospects.

One can only speculate about Bron-
cos’ motivations for frantically trading
up to choose player with faulty footwork
and a slow release. Though Tebow’s
college track record and impeccable
off-ﬁeld reputation will sell tickets and
jerseys, his fortunes on the ﬁeld are not
so easily predictable‘.

Tebow has worked furiously to trans-
form himself into a viable NFL invest-
ment. He radically altered his throwing
motion to cut down on his release time
and has taken more snaps from under
center to prove he can master the foot-
work required of a_ professional quarter-
back. At the scouting combine, the Flor-
ida QB ran a record three-cone shuttle
time, convincing many that his uncom-
mon combination of size (6’3” 245 lbs)

‘ and speed (4.7 second 40-yard dash) can

translate at the next level.

Despite this, however, the odds re-
main heavily stacked against Tebow.
His most basic disadvantage is one that
no amount of training can ﬁx: he is left-

handed. Like a lefty shortstop, Tebow
plays the one position in the sport that is
rarely kind to southpaws.

There have been just 36 left-handed
quarterbacks in the NFL’s history. Of
those, ﬁve have had long, successﬁil
careers. Hall-of-Famer Steve Young,
Boomer Esiason, Mark Brunell, Frankie
Albert and Ken Stabler combined to win
three Super Bowls, play in 22 Pro Bowls
and amass a touchdown-to-interception
ratio of 1.26 to 1. Add in Michael Vick,
Scott Mitchell and Jim Zorn, and these
elite eight could hang with any of their
righty counterparts.

But go any further down the line, and
the numbers get ugly. The remaining 28
left-handers have notched just three Pro
Bowl appearances and zero Super Bowl
wins. Sixteen never won a game they
started, and much of the list reads like
a who’s who of draft busts. Todd Ma-
rinovich, Tony Graziani, Chris Simms
and Cade_McNown are just of few of the
more disappointing members.

There are a number of theories as to
why southpaws rarely succeed in the
pros despite fruitful college careers.
The ﬁrst is plain physics: the football
spirals in the opposite direction when
thrown by a lefty as opposed to a right-
hander. This forces receivers to adjust to
the different arc, fade and perspective
of a lefty-thrown ball. In college this

is rarely crucial. But the tight passing
lanes and tiny windows quarterbacks
must force throws into in the pros means
that any slight variation can throw off a
play’s timing.

Having a left-hander at QB also
forces the team to reverse the entire
playbook. Rollouts must move left in-
stead of right, receivers have to adjust

volatile. Both Orton and Quinn are play-
ers in their prime used to battling for
playing time. After an uneven career in
Chicago, Orton was shipped to Denver
last year, where he played well but rare-

I 1y great. Instead of a vote of conﬁdence

in the off-season, coach Josh McDaniels
brought in Quinn and drafted Tebow.
Quinn comes from the Cleveland

wins.

their routes and the right tackle is now
the all-important blind-side blocker. For
teams who aren’t settled at the position,
there is little chance that a lefty will get
enough quality reps to be comfortable
playing within a reversed playbook.
Unfortunately for Tebow, the Bron-
cos are just such a team. He will enter
camp as part of a three-man position

battle with incumbent Kyle Orton and V

newcomer Brady Quinn. Both are right-
handed.

In addition to the expectations and
status heaped onto a ﬁrst-round draftee,

the quarterback situation is potentially I

Browns, where he waged a positional
battle with Derek Anderson for two
years without ever gaining a sense of
job security.

With Orton and Quinn trying desper-
ately to prove themselves, Tebow will
not beneﬁt from the type of mentor-ap-
prentice situation under which QBs like
Steve Young ﬂourished. Instead, he will
be thrust into the limelight, with every
misstep and incomplete pass mercilessly
dissected. V

Tebow’s obstacles extend beyond his
personal and team situation, including
learning a new pro-style system, mak-

ing do with an underwhelming receiv-
ing corps and breaking the tradition of
Florida QBs as NFL failures.

But if there is one trait Tebow shares
with lefty greats like Young and Esiason,
it is his pretematural leadership skills.
He commanded a college team of future
NFL stars better than Quinn and Orton
ever have in their respective careers,
and has demonstrated a work ethic that
in just a few months turned Tebow from
a ﬁfth-round talent to the 25th overall
selection. I

There is no doubt Tebow is conﬁdent
in his abilities, but it will take the effort
of the entire team to turn its ﬁrst-round
gamble into a long-term success.

Stemmons plaza gets a face-lift

By Paige Gance
s T A F F w R IT E R

The construction on Newcomb Hall and Hillel
House was expanded last month to Stemmons Plaza
as part of phase two of the university renovations.
Stemmons Plaza includes the area surrounded by
the back of the Colonnade, Leybum Library and
Reid Hall.

Construction on Stemmons Plaza began on April
17 and includes noticeable excavation of the areas
behind the low brick wall on either side of the front
entrance bridge to Leybum. '

All shrubs, trees, retaining walls, sections Of
the brick wall, and the exterior stairs from Stem-
mons Plaza to the library’s lower level 1 have been
removed. The area may look bare now, but only to
make way for improvement.

The University’s plans include the construction

“This project affords us an opportu-
nity to reinvent Stemmons Plaza in

ways that will signiﬁcantly beneﬁt

)

the overall campus atmosphere. ’

MIKE CARMAGNOLA, chief facilities ofﬁcer

of utility housing for infrastructural support of the
Colonnade in the newly cleared space. Since all
mechanical and electrical equipment for the Colon-
nade will be there, this leaves room for classrooms
and oﬂices in those buildings.

“By putting everything from the electrical infra-
structure to air-handling to ﬁre protection in these
utility areas outside of the Colonnade buildings
themselves, we are going to be able to maximize
the program space on the interior of the buildings,”
said Mike Carmagnola, Washington and Lee’s chief
facilities oﬁ°icer.

These new buildings will also help to create new
space on Stemmons Plaza and reduce the need for
vehicle traffic in that area. That means fewer golf
carts and futuristic-looking Tech Services cars that
students need to dodge on the way to the Science
Center.

“This project affords us an opportunity to rein-
vent Stemmons Plaza in ways that will signiﬁcantly
beneﬁt the overall campus atmosphere,” said Tom
Kalasky, director of design and construction at
W&L. “There will be several new spaces thatwill
allow for outdoor classes and casual, impromptu
gatherings on Stemmons.”

Stemmons is already home to the annual activi-
ties fair during O-week, the study abroad fair, part
of commencement exercises and various ice cream
socials. As a central part of campus, it was already
a good location for these gatherings. Once con-
struction is done, it will serve this purpose even i
better and more often.

Unlike the Hillel House and Newcomb Hall,
Stemmons Plaza will not be LEED certiﬁed. LEED
(Leaders in Energy and Environmental Design) is
an internationally recognized ‘certiﬁcation system
that measures how “green” a building is by its
energy savings, water eﬂiciency, CO2 emissions
reduction and overall environmental quality.

This does not mean that the univeristy ignored its
standards of sustainability when laying out plans for
Stemmons Plaza. Much of the limestone that will
be used is recycled from a previous project and the
roofs of the utility building are certiﬁed “green.”

Carmagnola said the university is planning this
and other impending projects to incorporate energy
conservation and sustainability. That commit-
ment includes the creation of new landscape plans,
such as a rain garden in association with the Hillel
House. “This is not only a question of improving
the landscaping, but it is also a water management
tool,” Carmagnola said.

Work on Newcomb is approximately ﬁve weeks
ahead of schedule and Hillel House remains reliably
on schedule. Around late June, faculty and staff will
start to reoccupy Newcomb Hall, and in late July
the Hillel House will be completed. The dedication
is currently scheduled for Sept. 24.

Until completion, however, the front entrance of
Leybum Library will be closed for extended periods
during the summer as the walkway is repaired and

benches and bio-retention planters installed. "Repairs '

on the Northern Auditorium roof will also continue
during this time in order to prevent further leaking.

By the time we return for the summer the famil-
iar construction fence surrounding Newcomb Hall
will be moved back and the walkway between Reid
and Newcomb will return to normal.

Once funding has been secured through private
grants, construction will move to phase 3: the reno-
vation of Payne Hall.

Eric Hoffman, president of the
EC, had a vision: to bring one of his
favorite fast food joints to Washing-
ton and Lee. Now, that vision is one
step closer to fulfillment as Chick-
Fil-A will be serving food out of the
Co-op this coming Wednesday, May

12th, as part ofa pilot program to test .

the franchise’s viability on campus.
After student demand poured in
last summer asking for more diverse
dining options, Hoffman decided
to tackle the project. A friend from
another law school told him that
Chick-Fil-A, a popular Southern
chain, served chicken sandwiches
through dining services once a week

at his school. That’s when the light ,

bulb went off.

“Chick-Fil-A is extremely popular
among students [here at W&L],” said
Hoffman, who mentioned he knew
friends who drove to Roanoke just
to enjoy the fast-food offerings of the
chicken chain. Knowing that the din-
ing services left considerable “room
for improvement,” it seemed only
natural to Hoffman that Chick-Fil-A
would be a perfect ﬁt.

So Hoffman brought the Chick-
Fil-A project before the EC, who sat
on the as-of-yet unhatched idea while
Hoffman contacted campus dining
services and the general manager
of the Roanoke Chick-Fil-A. The
project hit its ﬁrst roadblock when
dining services was hesitant to come
on board with the project, and the
Roanoke group worried about the

l

viability and proﬁtability ofa Chick-
Fil-A program in Lexington.

And while the idea was popular
among many students, other ofﬁcials
at the university were less concerned
and mostly indifferent with the seem-
ingly trivial pursuit of bringing a fast-
food restaurant to campus.

“The attitude has been that if this
is something we can accomplish,
that’s great,” says Hoffman, but
bringing Chick-Fil-A to Washington
and Lee “:..wasn’t on their agenda.”
Hoffman notes, however, that head
of dining services Alex DeSilva and
Dean of Students Dawn Watkins
were both “extremely supportive”
throughout his efforts.

said that the program will come at
a considerable cost, but he remains
confident that Chick-Fil-A could be
a thriving success.

But the courting process is not
yet over. This Wednesday, May 12th,
will mark the ﬁrst pilot run for the
potential.Chick-Fil—A sale through
the co-op. Running from l2-l pm,
the sale will give students a chance
to put their money where their mouth
is and show Chick-Fil-A that students
will back an on-campus initiative for
their business.

ideally, the Roanoke restaurant
will sign on after Wednesday’s test-
run and stait a program for the com-
ing school year to sell Chick-Fil-A

“If we show [Chick-Fil-A] they ’re wel— ’

come, they ’ll come more and more. The

bottom line is this: if we prove proﬁtable

for them, it is only a matter of time before

someone has a permanent presence. ”

SCOTT CENTORINO, EC President

Ultimately, however, the EC
successfully courted both groups
and persuaded Chick-Fil-A to come
visit campus and tour the dining fa-
cilities. Noting that Chick-Fil-A has
stringent standards for the equipment
its chicken is cooked in, Hoffman

out of the co-op on a monthly basis.
Hoffman was optimistic that over-
whelming proﬁts from a monthly sale
would quickly bring an escalation to
Chick-Fil-A‘s efforts here, ultimately
bringing the franchise to W&L full-
time in the coming years.

mung.

Though it may take some time

and a considerable display of interest .

from the student body, the process of
bringing a new fast-food option to
W&L may ﬁnally be within reach. If
the recent EC elections are any indi-
cation, Chick-Fil-A is a top priority
for student voters this year. Current
EC President Scott Centorino, ‘ll,
described the popularity of his pro-
chicken platform last month: “lt’s
funny that it only recently became a
hot topic during the EC campaign,”
said Centorino, “because it’s some-
thing Eric was working on for so
long. 1 decided, somewhat offhand-
edly, to include it in my campaign
as one of my ten commitments, and
suddenly the idea emerged as one of
the campaign’s biggest issues.”

So while Hoffman graduated
from the Law School last weekend,
he has made sure to pass the reigns
on to Centorino and the rest of the
current EC.

Centorino shares Hoffman’s en-
thusiasm and optimism for the proj-
ect, but knows that there is a tough
road ahead before Chick-Fil-A estab-
lishes itself here for the long term.

“If we show the company they’re
welcome, they’ll come more and
more,” he said. “The bottom line is
this: if we prove proﬁtable for them, it
is only a matter oftime before some-
one has a permanent presence.”

A bone to p

ick with Panhellenic

Speciﬁcally forbidding Kappa Delta and Theta from participating in Sigma Chis Derby Days hurt a charity fundraiser

By the Sigma Chi Fraternity
c o L u M N I s T s
Before beginning this article,

Sigma Chi would like to thank ‘

all the students who participated
in Derby Days 2010.

This year, Sigma Chi placed
a special effort on increasing the
philanthropic focus of Derby
Days and we are proud to have
raised a grand total of $10,529

throughout the week. All pro- »

ceeds during Derby Days will
be pledged to The Children’s
Miracle Network, Sigma Chi’s
national philanthropy.

Sigma Chi certainly feels that
the sum raised speaks both to the
dedication of the participating
sororities as well as the capacity
for Greek houses to make mean-
ingful contributions to social
causes. .

That being said, a major point
of contention and concern arose
with Derby Days this year that
we feel must be brought to the
attention of the student body.

At the beginning of winter
term, the Panhellenic Council
made two disciplinary rulings
against Kappa Delta and Kappa
Alpha Theta, placing them both
on social probation through win-
ter term.

While certainly a harsh pun-
ishment, it was justiﬁable in the
sense that it affected the sorori-
ties in question as well as the
rest of the Greek community
equally. However, Panhellenic
also speciﬁcally banned both KD
and Theta from participating in
Derby Days, Sigma Chi’s largest
annual fundraiser and as demon-
strated by the sum raised above,
one of the largest fundraisers on
the W&L campus.

At the same time, Panhel-
lenic permitted both sororities to
participate in any fundraisers or
social events organized by other
Greek organization during spring
term other than Derby Days.

Sigma Chi strongly feels that
Panhellenic’s ruling unfairly
discriminated against our frater-
nity, damaged the reputation of
the event and diminished Derby
Days’ philanthropic potential
despite the fact that we had no
involvement in the events for
which KD and Theta were sanc-
tioned.

Sigma Chi has repeatedly ad-
dressed Panhellenic requesting
their reconsideration on this is-

sue.

Despite our efforts to open a
dialogue, Panhellenic has ignored
our appeals, showing a blatant
lack of respect for our concerns
and demonstrating what we be-
lieve to be an egregious abuse of
their authority.

In this sense Sigma Chi feels
that Panhellenic’s leadership used
their disciplinary ruling to pursue
a misguided personal agenda, ul-
timately choosing to dictate what
they believe is best rather than to

allow the entire student body to I

pursue what clearly is an effec-
tive fundraiser.

Several key issues have been
raised in the midst ofthis conﬂict
and we feel that it is both nec-
essary and appropriate to make
these issues public.

First, any member of the stu-
dent body can appeal disciplin-

nalized.

The fact that at any given time
during the week in which Derby
Days took place, members of KD
or Theta could attend any other
philanthropic or social event be-
sides Derby Days is ridiculous.
As members of the same student
body, Sigma Chi deserves to be
treated equally.

Being a student governing
body, Panhellenic is expected
to recognize imbalances of this
sort and should have limited both
sororities to social probation
through winter term with no ad-
ditional punishment.

On multiple accounts, Sigma
Chi pointed out this imbalance
but Panhellenic chose to follow
through with their ruling,‘know-
ingly discriminating against Sig-
ma Chi and penalizing a fund-

v raiser.

it. Sigma Chi also made this case
to Panhellenic and again they de-
nied us reconsideration on this
account.

In the wake of this sanction,
Sigma Chi repeatedly requested
that Panhellenic open a- discus-
sion regarding the logic behind
the issue and give us an op-
portunity to make our concerns
known.

Certainly, we feel that Derby
Days is a great opportunity for
the W&L Greek community to
demonstrate its commitment to
charity, and as such the partici-
pation of all sororities is highly
valued. '

Panhellenic, however, refused
to engage in a discussion with
Sigma Chi about the sanction,
the rationale behind the decision
to issue it or the valid reasons
presented to reconsider it.

Sigma Chistrongly feels that Panhellenic 3‘ ruling unfairly

discriminated against our ﬁcaternily, damaged the reputation

of the event and diminished Derby Days ‘philanthropic

potential, despite the fact that we had no involvement in the

events for which KD and Theta were sanctioned.

 

ary actions issued by Panhellenic
within three days ofthe decision.
In the case oftheir rulings against
KD and Theta, however, Panhel-
lenic chose not to inform Sigma
Chi of the decision to ban KD
and Theta from Derby Days, nor
did they inform us of our ability
to appeal the ruling.

As"such, Sigma Chi remained
unaware of Panhellenic’s disci-
plinary actions and was never
able to ﬁle a formal appeal. Be-
cause Panhellenic’s meetings
are held in private, it should be
the responsibility of Panhellenic
to inform all relevant parties of
its decisions as well as of their
ability to appeal. This case also
brings into question the alleged
right of a student governing body
to make rulings targeting speciﬁc
events.

As Sigma Chi played no role
in the infractions of KD or Theta,
our fraternity and its sponsored
events should not have been pe-

Competition between sorori-

ties has always been the corner-
stone of fundraising at Derby
Days. Competition motivates so-
rorities to participate in the Pen-
ny Race and buy t—shirts, both of
which donate money directly to
the Children’s Miracle Network.

While any member of KD or
Theta could have made dona-
tions on her own accord, refus-
ing their sororities participation
certainly decreased their incen-
tive to donate.

Furthermore, all participating
sororities were generous enough
to agree to grant a $2 participa-
tion donation per member. The
absence of KD and Theta limited
this grant.

Therefore, we strongly feel
that not allowing sororities to
participate diminished both the
competitive spirit surrounding
the event as well as its philan-
thropic potential, and Derby
Days undoubtedly suffered for

Showing consideration and
respect ‘for their peers should be
a primary concern for an orga-
nization that regularly interacts
with the student body, especially
on the W&L campus. In our case,
Panhellenic failed to live up to
this expectation.

Sigma Chi believes that Derby
Days was unfairly discriminated
against because of unsubstanti-
ated assumptions and hearsay.

Derby Days is not intended
to be an event that belittles or
degrades women. Sigma Chi
values the gender relations we
have built over time, and we
would not host Derby Days if
we felt that it would compro-
mise those relations.

Likewise, we believe that all
Derby Days events are reason-
able and we take speciﬁc care to
review the schedule with soror-
ity oﬂicers beforehand.

Obviously sorority partici-
pation is voluntary in Derby

University wins a prestigious award

F rattingHard. com names W&L as the frattiest school in the country

By Tim McAleenan
co LU M NIST

GeorgeWashington’s $20,000
donation to the school. Robert E.
Lee’s presidency. Big moments,
no doubt. But we’ve got one
more to add to the list. After a
competition that lasted almost a
month and a half, FrattingHard.
corn has dubbed Washington &
Lee the frattiest school in the
country. It was a pretty intense
competition that featured many
solid match-ups, and here’s the
story of how we got there.

Needless to say, we got off to
a good start in the tournament.
We were seeded #2, and we
faced off against Washington,
seeded #15. There were no com-
ments or trash-talking in the fo-
rums during this round, but this
match-up was special because of
our school’s parallel technolo-
gies. »

' On one hand, you’ve got the
University of Washington, where
they’re just now learning about
the breakthrough technology
called “laptops” (look mom, no
wires!), and on the other hand,
you’ve got Washington & Lee,
where it takes about ﬁve minutes

to load a Google search engine

(keep in mind, the ﬁrst round"

took place in March, when you
had to do an Indian rain dance

just to get Microsoft Outlook to»

load, and plus, you had to deal
with the side effects of the rain.)

But, in the end, I don’t think
that really mattered, since we
steamrolled past Washington,
capturing 81 percent of the vote.
We went on to face North Caroli-

na in the second round (I’m sure
they’re delighted to know they
made it farther in the frat bracket
than the actual NCAAS), and we
cruised to the “Frat Sweet Six-
teen” without much difﬁculty.
But cheer up, North Carolina,
you still had the, err, NITs.

Our Sweet Sixteen Match
against #3 seed Florida State was
pretty low key: deep, philosophi-
cal questions about whether Tim
Tebow’s virginity increased or
decreased his frattiness came up
which seamlessly transitioned
into a debate about whether or
not George Bush was the fratti-
est president.

After clarifying the differ-
ence between Florida and Flori-
da State, as well as making a few
references to Stonewall Jackson
and Robert E. Lee, W&L won
easily. We captured 75 percent
of the vote, which according to
user “Shacking with you Sweet-
heart,” was due to the fact the
“Florida is ﬁlled with geezers
who don’t use intemet duh Iol.”
Well put.

After that bit of Florida fun,
we had the chance to pull off
our ﬁrst upset of the tournament,
beating #1 seed Alabama to ad-
vance to the “Fratty Four.” The
banter on the messageboards
was what you might expect- Ala-
bama people talking about how
no one, with the exception of
pretentious, snobby (***censor
***) clowns had heard of W&L,
and W&L students countering
that our Greek fees are prob-

ably higher than their tuition.

Fun stuff. Then we heard from
this guy with the usemame “Roll
Tide Roll” who said “W&L is
like 80 percent Greek. If every-
one there is fratty, then no one’s
frattyl” Hmm, he makes a good
point. If everyone on this earth
is inhaling oxygen, then no one’s
breathing!

After our victory over Ala-
bama, we made it to the Fratty
Four, along with Kentucky,
Southern Methodist and our
friends at U-Va. We had to get
past the University of Kentucky
to make it to the Frat Champi-
onship. The bashing here was
pretty tense as well. One of the
lighter comments came from
“frat papa” who said that “USC
named its horse Traveler. And
USC is so not fratty. I’m giving
this one to Kentucky.”

Yes, but, frat papa, hear me
out on this one. USC named
its mascot Traveler well after
Robert E. Lee named his horse
Traveller. You can’t control what
people do after you. That’s like
saying because the lamest person
you know names her kid Betty
White, Betty White is somehow
less awesome.

After we beat Kentucky
pretty substantially (61 percent),
we marched on to the Champi-
onship round against Southern
Methodist. And you might be
able to guess how the message
boards were for that match. You
know how Robert E. Lee taught
us about duty, honor and civil

behavior? Yeah well, remember,
we were facing Texans.

We heard criticism from
“F RATmonster,” who bantered
that “how does it feel to be the
size of a high school you are
D3? Im sorry but your school
is not fratty, you school is not
SMUs ﬁrst choice...SMU is the
students; ﬁrst choice.” Thanks

FRATmonster, your eloquence '

can only be matched by your
grammar. I wish I could stop
by Rockbridge Middle School
or something and have the
fourth graders try and diagram
that sentence. Umm professor,
what happens when there are no
verbs and the sentences don’t
stop? (Answer: You get a Tim
McAleenan column). Despite
the fact that we routinely faced
schools literally 10 times our
size, we were able to become
the FRATTIEST SCHOOL IN
AMERICA, beating SMU with
54 percent.

1 know, I know. We got to
keep this in perspective. There
probably won’t be any banners
in the commons to celebrate,
and I doubt admissions will be
trumping our school’s frat supe-
riority in their pamphlets any-
time soon.

But for now, I can sit back,
relax and spend my summer
telling my friends, “I may not
be any frattier than you, but my
school sure is.”

Days and they can choose not
to participate if they feel that the
event treats them unfairly.

This year, we made strides
to ensure that ﬂag football was
ofﬁciated by campus recreation
referees and that the results of
events were fairly reported on
a visual scoreboard and on our
website.

All participating sororities
were given the point system prior
to the events.

On this account, it is difficult
for us to reconcile Panhellenic
justifying its punishment on the
basis that Derby Days is a de-
grading event with a purely so-
cial focus.

Student governing bodies
should value participation in
philanthropic events, even if
they do have social aspects as
well. Allowing KD and Theta to
participate in Derby Days and to
work with us to expand the scale
of our fundraising would have
been a great way to allow both
sororities to turn a bad situation
into a good one.

We feel that the sum raised
this year certainly speaks to sup-
pori that sororities have for phi-
lanthropy at Derby Days and we
cannot stress enough how much
we value their continued partici-
pation.

We feel that KD and Theta
would also have made great con-
tributions to Derby Days in terms
of their input, competitive nature
and shared belief in the impor-
tance of philanthropy at W&L.
Indeed, their participation was
sorely missed.

In the future, Sigma Chi

our event are addressed and that
Derby Days makes the greatest
impact possible in terms of fund-
raising.

We feel with utmost certainty
that our event can be further im-
proved through close coordina-
tion with all sororities and we
look to extend such discussions
in the future.

While we hope that our im-
provements and openness will
continue to garner sorority sup-
port for Derby Days, it is clear
to us that Panhellenic has little
interest in working with us to im-
prove Derby Days and seeks only
to further damage our fundraiser.

In no way will Sigma Chi
tolerate the continued abuses of
power demonstrated by Panhel-
lenic nor will we idly allow them
to continue their pursuit of a per-
sonal agenda that we feel runs
contrary to the interest of the stu-
dent body.

When all is said and done,
Panhellenic repeatedly tried to
diminish a fundraiser that raised
over $10,000. We feel that, with-
out a doubt, this sum speaks to
the charitable capacity of all of
W&L’s sororities and is a sum
that puts an exclamation point on
Greek life at W&L.»

Moreover, we hope that the
sum raised proves to Panhellenic
that in the end, they were wrong.

Again, we sincerely appreci-
ate the participation of everyone
involved who helped us make
Derby Days such a great event
this year and we hope to work
closely with all participating so-
rorities in the future to continue
to make Derby Days an outstand-

Summer movies towatch this year

If you are looking for a distraction from your summer job or lack thereof summer blockbusters have the solution

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINION EDITOR

We’ve had a wonderful week
of weather here in Lexington.
The sun has been perpetually out,
and it’s barely ever been cold.
Mean tans have been crafted and
day drinking has been constantly
enjoyable.

However, for most of us, this
nice weather will be relatively
short lived. In two weeks, a good
portion ofus will be offto spend
a summer locked in a cubicle,
Burger King drive-thru station
or ﬂuorescently lighted clothing
store. ‘

Maybe you’ll be lucky
enough to be working construc-
tion or at a camp, but remember
you’re still going to be at work
instead of celebrating your last
two weeks of a six-week spring
term.

I wanted to get fully prepared
for a summer of staring out of a

‘window at the beautiful weather

that I cannot enjoy, so I decided
to go to a movie theater.

One of the few nice aspects
about the summer that doesn’t
include weather is the summer
blockbuster. These movies aren’t
the kind of movies that will bore
you with erroneous details like
an interesting plot, well thought-
out narrative and compelling
characters. -

Instead they use the Ameri-
can dream as their guide to mov-
ie making: just throw in tons of
money and big explosions and
it’s bound to work.

But this year, there are no
“Transformers,” “Harry Potter”
or James Cameron to draw us
into the movie theater. The big
names this year are a bunch of
sequels from moderately popu-
lar franchises and a huge influx
of hopeful franchises trying to
make just enough money to cov-
er their costly budgets. But don’t
fret, I have the answer for you.

Yes, I know that Rotten To-
matoes, IMdB and Metacritic
all have much more hashed out
and more professional answers
for you. V

Luckily for me, ITS at Wash-
ington and Lee has my back. At
my behest, they slowed the inter-
net down so much that the cam-
pus has a whole I994 vibe to: it.

And you know what students
did in 1994? They read school
newspapers instead of ﬁnding
more expert opinions on the in-

ternet. Thanks, ITS!

So now that you are forced to
abide by my opinion of movies
that I have yet to see (I did see
the trailers, so that clearly makes
me capable of summing them up
completely), you can properly
decide how best to spend your
selected two-hour break from
the wonderful weather outside or
from your depressing cubicle.

If you are a Republican, see
“Iron Man 2.” This is the one
movie that I actually have seen,
and can tell you that it really is
the Republican wet dream. _

The entire movie is ‘about
how to properly assign defense
contracts. A Russian is the bad
guy in this movie. When Tony
Stark, the main character played
by Robert Downey Jr., becomes
misguided and distracted, he
hangs up an Obama-like poster
that says lronman instead of
Hope. Stark even asserts that
he has “privatized world peace”
in the beginning of the movie.
I don’t think Libertarians need
porn anymore.

If you missed “Gladiator”
playing on TNT every night this
week, watch “Robin Hood.”

Originally ’ actor Russell
Crowe and director Ridley Scott
wanted to make a Robin Hood
movie centered on compelling
aspects of the Sheriff of Not-
tingham. Unfortunately, Russell
Crowe quickly realized that he
couldn’t make nearly enough
money playing a bad guy, so he
demanded the script be changed
to a mix of “Gladiator” and
“Kingdom of Heaven.” Oh well,
at least Crowe is going to make
archery look ominous.

If your boyfriend doesn’t
know that his only role in life is
to cater only to you, take him to
“Sex and the City 2.”

Just tell him that you want a
special date night between the
two of you and if he’s reluc-
tant, tell him that he can pick
the movie once he gets there. Of
course, once you get to the ticket
line, do the obligatory “I’m still
wearing the pants in the relation-
ship” move and pick the movie
that you want to watch.

My only advice for this mov-
ie is to make sure that. you loos-
en the chain around your boy-
friend’s ankle during the movie.

If you want to break up with

This movie is neck and neck
with “Furry Vengeance” in the
race for “Gigli” Memorial Atro-
cious Movie of the Year.

You might also like this mov-

movie depicting life on the New

Queen Latifah was too sexy to
play a supporting role in a chick

should’ve ditched the whole rap
shtick that made him famous and
instead focus on acting and bas-
ketball, or if physical therapy for
two hours somehow excites you.
I think that covers most of you
guys, right?

If you watched “Broke-
back Mountain” and thought to
yourself, “Hey, that guy hook-
ing up with Heath Ledger looks
like the kind of guy who really
needs his own action movie,”
watch “Prince of Persia: Sands
of Time.”

Look, I get it;» you always
wanted to see what it would look
like if Ben Kingsley completely
sold out. I thought “Gandhi” was
overrated, too.

At least this movie has a solid
base of a well thought-out script.
What? It’s based on a video
game? Shit. Prepare for “Alad-
din” meets “Doom.”

If you think unshaven double
chins and sarcastic, pithy one-
liners are sexy, watch “Get Him
to the Greek” and “Cyrus.”

2005 had Steve Carrell. 2007
had Seth Rogan. 2008 had Jason
Sega]. 2009 had Paul Rudd. And
now 2010 has Jonah Hill.

Hill is the next in line to carry

the crown of nerdy, yet hilarious

comedy star. He has two movies
that he’s starring in and both ap-
pear to be pretty good. So, ladies,
if you go to your local Big and
Tall store to ﬁnd a mate, prepare
to be turned on.

If you hate kids and any hope
for the future of humanity, then
you’re in luck! This summer is
ﬁlled with a countdown of an-
noyingly terrible franchises that
will destroy all hope you have
for the next generation.

Let’s start with “Marmaduke

I” (there’s going to be more
of them... just a warning). Itfs
all about a dog who can talk.
WHAT? Dogs can’t talk. They
are thinking way too outside the
box for this one.

Then we have “Cats and Dogs
2,” which ups “Marmaduke” by
making cats talk too. Hilarity is
bound to ensue.

After that, we have “Toy
Story 3,” which will duke it out
with “Shrek 4” to see who can
one-in-four all of my childhood
memories. I

Want to feel good about your
hope for the future? Pixar’s next
three movies from 2010-2012
are all sequels of some kind. If
it worked for “The Little Mer-
maid” and “Cinderella,” it should
deﬁnitely work for “Cars” and
“Monster’s Inc.”. .. right?

If you spent the last decade
convinced that Will Smith and
Jackie Chan should’ve been a
movie together, watch “Karate
Kid.”

I know, you won’t be com-
pletely satiated because “Karate
Kid” only has JackieiChan and
Will Smith’s son, Jaden, but,
still, doesn’t that almost make up
for Chris Tucker being cast in all
of the “Rush Hour” movies? It
doesn’t. Well, at least this movie
can get you prepared for China’s
eventual purchase of America.

If you thought “Van Helsing”
was just that great of a movie,
watch “Jonah Hex.” Both char-
acters wear the same freaking
outﬁt. Both names are three syl-
lables long, and the only differ-
ence between plots is whereeach
character kills the eventual bad
guy. Is Hollywood even trying
anymore?

If you would rather hang out
with alumni than with actual stu-
dents, watch “Grown Ups.”

What isn’t fun about see-
ing has-beens 15 years past
their prime (Adam Sandler and
Chris Rock) try and relive the
glory days by living vicariously
through their families in a setting
that only draws upon nostalgia?

But here’s the catch, during
alumni weekend at least the old
people are paying you for the
fun. In “Grown Ups,” you have
to pay $10 of your own money
to watch these aged comedians
slowlygdecompose on screen for
two hours.

If you don’t have a penis,
watch the new “Twilight.” I think
that pretty much sums it up... I

If you thought “Alien vs.
Predator” was ,a little too much
but “Predator” just quite wasn’t
enough, watch “Predators.” If
there’s more than one, that’s
bound to make the movie better
right?

If you wanted to see exactly
how much money Nicholas Cage
owes the government, watch
“The Sorcerer’s Apprentice.”

For those who don’t know,
Nicholas Cage owes an insane
amount of money in back taxes,
and he’s repaying his debt by
killing as many classic movies
as possible.

In this installment, Cage and

sidekick producer Jerry Bruck-
heimer decide to do to Mickey
Mouse’s segment‘ in “Fantasia”
what that that broken oil rig is
now doing to the Gulf Coast.

If you are the kind of person
who somehow stays focused on
movies after taking a harmful
amount of drugs, watch “Incep-
tion.”

Christopher Nolan’s ﬁrst
movie since “The Dark Knight”
features Leonardo DiCaprio and
Ellen Page (aka Juno). This is
Christopher Nolan’s umpteenth
attempt at trying to put you in an
insane asylum, and he might be
successful if enough people try
and experiment chemically be-
fore this movie.

If you haven’t seen enough
Angelina Jolie movies that have
her playing the following charac-
ter are: innocent yet sexy ‘central
character transforms into seem-
ingly guilty and dangerous and
therefore exponentially more
sexy central character transforms
into emotionally vulnerable with
ostensibly downplayed sexiness
central character transforms into
dominant hero with some article
of clothing missing central char-
acter, then see “Salt.” By the
way, if you could comprehend
that last sentence, you might be
able to understand “Inception.”

You wouldn’t believe it, but
“Salt” is apparently about An-
gelina Jolie playing a sexy CIA
agent with something to hide.

lfyou thought that Julia Rob-
erts should’ve been cast in “Ju-
lie and Julia,” watch -“Eat, Pray,
Love.” The movie is going after

the same exact book club-loving
audience that “Julie and Julia”
worked for.

Who would’ve thought that
most women would like a movie
about food, traveling and love? I
really need to get out more.

If you are a female pedophile,
watch “Scott Pilgrim vs. the
World.” If Michael Cera playing
another teenager in the throngs
of puberty trying to impress
a girl by doing wacky things
doesn’t weed out this select de-
mographic of predator cougars, I
don’t know what will.

If you like watching A-List

factors blow stuff up, watch “The

A-Team.” Liam Neeson pones
on more bad guys, and Bradley
Cooper makes jokes about how
much better at life he is than ev-
eryone else. You’re pretty much
getting what you expect.

If you like watching B-List
has-beens blow stuff up, watch
“The Expendables.”

Sylvester Stallone, Jet Li and
Jason Statham made a movie
about what people have been
saying about their acting skills
for years. They are going to do
to action movies what Adam
Sandler and Chris Rock are go-

Spring term shouldn ’t b

By Randi Wilson
STAFF WRITER

Every year, James Dick has a
handful of students walk into his
Outing Club office in the heart of
the commons, and ask him what
there is to do.

They never mention it, but
Dick says he has a feeling that
most of them are seniors.

As ﬁrst-years, they say, they
went on a hike here, a canoe
trip there and suddenly college
overcame their free time. Four
years later, they return to his of-
ﬁce, telling him, “I feel like I’ve
missed out.”

That’s part of the reason for
this year’s Outing Club motto:
Are you balanced?

“Don’t study, party or rock
climb too much,” said Dick.

He has nothing against any of
those things but knows that any
in excess can lead to an unhealthy
lifestyle.

“The basement of a frat house
isn’t gonna change,” he says,
encouraging people to explore
outdoors.

The Lexington Farmers Market
offers a wide variety of local and
regional produce and goods in a
friendly environment. The market
is located in the parking lot behind
the Southern Inn on Jefferson

8 a.m. until 1 p.m., the market
attracts vendors from all over the
region. Many organic, sustainable
and eco-friendly farms are repre-

Dick, director ofcampus rec-

campus and within a short drive
to break out from the study-party-
sleep cycle familiar to so many
students.

Just walk into his ofﬁce, and
he can recommend 50 things off

to go for an hour drive, the list
easily doubles.

We return with advice on how
to navigate the endless stream of
new independent music and ﬁnd
the very best of the bunch:

Caribou
Swim (Merge)

One of the most rewarding
things about listening to Caribou is
that Dan Snaith has never made the
same record twice. In his excellent
review of Swim on AllMusic.com,
‘Tim Sendra describes the previ-
ous LPs from Caribou (originally
known as Manitoba): “the left-ﬁeld
IDM of Start Breaking My Heart,
the shimmering neo—shoegaze of
Up in Flames, the spare Krautrock
of The Milk of Human Kindness,
and the songcraft of Andorra.”

There are elements that mark
those albums as Snaith’s work
throughout, and until 2007’s An-
dorra, there seemed to be a very
logical progression——culminating
in that brilliant release from three
years ago, which won Canada’s
Polaris Music Prize.

If you’re expecting more psy-
chedelic pop on Swim, you’re in
for a huge surprise. But it’s ulti_-
mately a pleasant one: this is the
best Caribou record yet. It’s much
more electronic than anything
Snaith has recorded since Up in
Flames and yet still as accessible
as his pop-leaning recent work.
Let the man himself explain: “The
real substance of the sound of the
record for me is this idea of making
dance music that consists of liquid
elements... Everything is washing
around you while you’re listening
to it.”

Critics and fans are already call-
ing this Caribou’s masterpiece. If
his ﬁrst decade of work is any indi-
cation, Snaith may put out a record
in two or three years that somehow
manages to trump his ﬁrst ﬁve LPs.
But, it’s one of the best records of
2010. Check out “Odessa,” “Leave
House,” “Jamelia” (featuring vo-
cals from Born Rufﬁans frontman
Luke Lalonde) and “Kaili.”

The Living Sisters
Love to Live (Vanguard)

Before I read a brief April 23
NPR-ticle about The Living Sis-
ters, I thought they sounded a bit
familiar: The Bird and the Bee’s
Inara George, Lavender Diamond’s
Becky Stark and stellar solo per-
former Eleni Mandell let their love-
ly voices melt together on Love to

Live, the ﬁrst ofﬁcial release since
they began their collaboration in
2006. With tinges of country, jazz
and soul, these Sisters make beauti-
ful (pop) music together that calls
to mind the melding harmonics of
Jenny Lewis & the Watson Twins’
Rabbit Fur Coat. While_ “Ferris
Wheel” and “You Make Me Blue”
are early standouts, most of the
songs on this all-too-brief record
are worth a spin.
Sam Amidon
I See the Sign
(Bedroom Community)

A superb record from Vermont
native Sam Amidon, who spins
traditional songs and modern
worksel See the Sign features a
cover of an R. Kelly song, “Re-
lief”Ainto beautifully orchestrated
folk. Amidon plays the banjo and
guitar, and his “intimate, unshowy
voice” has been compared to Arthur
Russell (Q Magazine); his songs
are ﬂeshed out by the production
of Icelandic wizard Valgeir Sig-
urdsson and the arrangements of
Amidon’s long-time friend and
collaborator, the composer Nico
Muhly. Truly wonderful music that
will appeal to fans of Nina Nastasia,
Bill Callahan/(smog), and Bonnie
“Prince” Billy (who has also been
known to cover R. Kelly).

First Aid Kit
The Big Black and The Blue
(Wichita)

Finally, First Aid Kit has an al-
burn! The duo, made up of Swedish
sisters Johanna and Klara Soder-
berg, are probably familiar to many
Fleet Foxes fans who have ever
searched “Tiger Mountain Peas-
ant Song” on YouTube—the duo’s
cover is the ﬁrst result, with over
a million views. Sadly, that track
isn’t included on the sisters’ debut,
but the album more than delivers.
Its vocal-heavy folk, with some
slightly instrumentation that only
serves to highlight said vocals, and
for good reason—their voices and
harmonies are phenomenal (PHE-
NOMENAL) and the oftentimes
wistful folk they sing is a perfect
ﬁt. Try ‘‘In the Morning,” “Hard
Believer,” “Heavy Storm,” and “I

‘ Met Up with the King.”

Lexin on farmers market offers freshest fare for residents

Markets on ednesdays behind the Southern Inn bring farmers, and their products, from throughout Southwest Virginia

and very healthy.

Another vendor at the market
is Roller’s Bakery, located in
Waynesboro. Roller’s Bakery is
owned by a Mennonite couple
who bake out oftheir home. They
depend on markets such as the one
in Lexington to sell their bread
and pastries: the bakery does not
have a store. The owners said they
are are pleased with the attendance
at the Lexington Farmers Market

and have proﬁted from setting up
a stand weekly.

The Lexington Farmers Mar-
ket offers many delicious, whole-
some products, and the experience
is fun. This spring term, stop by
the market on Wednesdays and

Growingpains for young Generals

Weather, tough schedule hinder W&L is quest to defend its ODAC crown

By Stephen Peck

The Washington and Lee base-
ball team’s 2010 season came to
an end on April 25 when a ninth-
inning rally versus Lynchburg fell
short. The 8-3 loss ﬁnished off a

roller-coaster year for the Gener-
als, one in which the defending
ODAC champs dealt with tough
weather, a young team and a
difficult schedule. The team was
never able to recapture last year’s ‘
magic, and closed out their spring

I with a l4-l9 overall record (8-I0

ODAC).

“It is difﬁcult to say that the
season was not a disappointment,”
said senior captain and starting
pitcher Chuck Davidson.

“We were obviously all disap-
pointed with the overall outcome
of the season. Our record was not
pretty, we came up just short at

At times it was a struggle for
head coach Jeff Stickley’s crew.
The Generals had to deal with an
abnormal winter in Lexington,
one that blanketed Cap’n Dick

Smith field in snow until late '

February. The team then opened
its season with four straight losses
at a tournament in Atlanta. They
were not able to string a two-
game winning streak together
until March 20. And while they
sported a respectable 9-5 record
in home games, they were just
3-12 away from Lexington.
However, there were a number
of memorable moments. Senior

Captain Will Lewis ended his
career at W&L with a spectacular
.403 average. Senior second base-
man John Ditore caught on ﬁre at
the plate in early March, leading
the team in hits, runs, doubles and
batting average (.500) during a
signiﬁcant stretch of the season.
Junior pitcher Gregg Laswell
struck out 46 batters in his 43
innings of work. And on March
23, the Generals wove together
a masterpiece performance and
knocked off Shenandoah, the No.
20 ranked team in the nation, by
a score of 16-11.

But none of that can match the
best moment of the year though
for W&L baseball. In the first
game of the ODAC tournament,
W&L was the No. 1-seeded
Hampden—Sydney. HSC had
swept the Generals in a double-
header during the regular season,
but none of that mattered when
W&L entered the ninth inning
in a 2-2 tie on April 24. Lead-
ing off the bottom of the ninth,
sophomore second baseman
Alston James crushed a long ﬂy
ball. It carried over the fence for
a walk-off home run and an open-
ing round victory. As the team
raucously celebrated at home
plate, the excitement of last year’s
run to the ODAC championship
was in the air.

“I really felt we were going to
win it again,” Davidson said.

“That game was one of the
best all-around baseball games
I have ever been a part of. It
was a total team effort in which
we executed ﬂawlessly in every
aspect of the game,” Cardona
said. “That day, we were a team
who not only wanted to win, but
showed that we knew how to win.
That is what we will be looking
for all of next year”. '

Next year does look bright for
the Generals. The team returns 24
underclassmen including Cardo-
na, Laswell, James and ﬁrst-year
shortstop Johnathan Stutts, whose

ford on March 20.

345. batting average was second
on the team behind Lewis.

“We have the coaches [who]
know what it takes and I think
next year we look forward to
having the perfect combination
of leadership, talent, and attitude
to maximize this team’s potential
and win,” Cardona said.

Those six seniors who are
graduating will no doubt be

missed, however. Captains Da-
vidson and Lewis, along with
Ditore, Nate Adkins, Jim Pl-
antholt and Hunter Serenbetz
put in four quality years for the
program, and won an ODAC
championship along the way.
Their contributions do not stop
at win-loss records. They have
laid the groundwork for future
success in the program through

their commitment and leadership,
two qualities that future teams
will take with them.

Fall baseball will arrive soon,
and expectations are already high
for a team that learned so much
from the adversity thrown at it
this year.

Sports’ saddest stat

Yeardley Love is death puts spotlight on athletes and violence

By Adam Cancryn
SPORTS EDITOR

On Sunday, May 2, Yeardley
Love was an 22 year-old athlete
just days away from her college
graduation. By the next morn-
ing, she/had become yet another
statistic in what is sports’ most
disturbing trend.

Late that Sunday night,
ex-boyfriend and fellow Uni-
versity of Virginia student-ath-
lete George Huguely kicked
down Love’s bedroom door and
forced his way inside. Court
documents released Tuesday
detail a brutal encounter, in
which Huguely assaulted her,
“shaking Love so that her head
repeatedly hit the wall.”

Roommates found Love’s
beaten body early Monday,
her face badly bruised and her
right eye swollen shut. Police
described the cause of death as
blunt force trauma.

Charlottesville police arrest-
ed Huguely, a senior lacrosse
player, the next morning. Since
then, the investigation into
Love’s tragic death has painted
a grim portrait of Huguely as a
student-athlete whose sense of
entitlement and above-the-law
attitude left him unprepared and
unable to deal with any amount
of failure or rejection.

By all accounts, Huguely
was brought up through a sys-
tem that told him he couldn’t
fail. Growing up in suburban
Chevy Chase, Md., he went to
high school at the $29,000 per-
year Landon School. The son
of a successful businessman,
he vacationed at his family’s
$1.2 million house in Palm
Beach, Fla. He was hugely
popular in high school and col-
lege, according to friends and
acquaintances. At every step
along the way, George Huguely
experienced only the best.

in school and on the ﬁeld,
Huguely also was the best. At
Landon, he was a three-time
honor roll student, quarterback

ofthe football team and an All-
American lacrosse “prodigy.”
U-Va. recruited him to play for
their revered program, which
is currently ranked No. l in
the country. In his 22 years,‘
Huguely rarely experienced
failure. ’

But while he might have
been the king of his own little
world, cracks of insecurity and
egotism showed through. in

in addition to being drunk in
public, he was charged with
public swearing and resisting
arrest. Friends of Huguely told
ABC News he had a temper and
problems with alcohol.
And so when Love ended
their relationship, that entitle-
ment-driven anger reared its
"head once again, combining
with what police expect to ﬁnd
was both alcohol and drugs to
result in her assault.
Unfortunately, Huguely is
not an anomaly. While there are

percent of domestic violence
perpetrators.

This ﬁnding was supported
by a Georgetown study that
found its student-athletes be-
ing arrested and charged with
violent assault at double the
rate of the rest of the campus
population.

in Huguely’s case as well as
many others, these statistics are
a result ofa system ofprivilege
that provides athletes with
everything and teaches them
nothing. In the hyper-gloriﬁed
world of sports today, athlet-
ics are often no longer about
building character but building
popularity, money and prestige.
Pro athletes are paid hundreds
of millions of dollars. College
athletes are campus celebrities,

showered at some universities
with alcohol, drugs and women.
Talented high schoolers are
given a free ride to college
before they’ve even begun the
ninth grade. Some might argue
that it’s merely a consequence
of sports as a business, but nev-
ertheless it is stunting athletes’
growth as human beings.
Perhaps the saddest part of
all of this is that our culture
has largely complied with this
shift. It is a compliance that
takes many forms. Sometimes
it is active participation: there is

extensive evidence that a janitor ’

scrubbed the bathroom clean

J minutes after Ben Roethlis-

berger’s alleged sexual assault
ofa woman in a Milledgeville
bar. Sometimes it’s a passive
attitude: of 168 sexual assault
allegations against athletes
from 1992 to 2003, just 22 went
to trial and only seven ended in
convictions.

But most times compliance
means ignoring the warning
signs. A Washington Post story
cited an altercation with Love
two months before her death
in which the two had to be
separated. And in the days fol-
lowing their break-up, Huguely
sent Love harassing e-mails and
later stole her computer. Police
later found it, along with a red-
stained U-Va. lacrosse T-shirt.

For those who follow sports
at any level, it is difﬁcult not to
idolize those on the ﬁeld or the
court. Admiration is not wrong.
But allowing that admiration
to perpetuate the acceptance
of poor and sometimes violent
behavior is a habit we must all
strive to end.

Yeardley Love’s death is a
tragedy, but it will be equally
as tragic if we learn nothing
from it.

A defensive mindset

Generals ’ 15th-ranked defense set the tone for 2010 season

By Henri Hammond-Paul
STAFF warren

The Washington and Lee
Generals men’s Lacrosse team
ended their 2010 campaign with
a 15-7 loss to conference rival
Roanoke College in the ODAC
tournament semiﬁnals.

But while the Generals (1 l-
6, 4-3 in the ODAC) fell short
of the conference title and an

short of some of our goals, the
men on the team really came
together and had a great time
on and offthe ﬁeld.”

Of the Generals’ six losses,
only one was decided by more
than three goals. Much of the
team’s success was due to
W&L’s 15th-ranked defense,

Will Keigler ended his senior
season ranked as the 6th all-time
point-getter in W&L lacrosse
history with 212 points (102
goals, 110 assists). He is just
one of four Generals ever to
score both over 100 goals and
100 assists. He earned lst team
all-conference honors along

The Washington and Lee Generals line up before a game during their spring
season. W&L went 11-6 overall, falling in the second round of the ODAC tour-

nament.

NCAA tournament bid, the
season featured a number of
individual accomplishments
and season highlights.

“It was a great season. When
you win 11 games, that means a
lot of success,” head coach Gene
McCabe said. “Although we fell

where senior goalie Matt Mason
allowed just 6.7 goals per game.
Led sophomore Joe LaSala,
junior Austin Wernecke and
senior Tyler Smith, the back line
also scooped 97 ground balls
and forced 77 turnovers.
Offensively, senior captain

with senior specialist Kevin
F eeney, who ranked fourth in
the conference in faceoff per-
centage (.578) and recorded 13
points (12 G, l A).

Seniors Smith and Logan
Bartlett and LaSala made the
all-conference second team,

while Wernecke earned an
honorable mention. it was the
second consecutive second
team honor for Smith.

McCabe said it will be sad
to see such a strong senior class
graduate this spring.

“The seniors performed very
well throughout their four years
with the program and their
presence and impact on the
team will be lasting,” he said.

Despite the enormous
amount of leadership and tal-
ent that will be graduating at
the end of this academic year,
the Generals are optimistic go-
ing forward.

“Many ﬁrst year and sopho-
mores played well and were
regular contributors on and off
the ﬁeld,” McCabe,said.

Promising young talent
and commitment is a staple of
a strong program, and W&L
expects to maintain that. With
the season ﬁnished, fans can
look forward to yet another
promising season next year
when the Generals will return
a signiﬁcant amount of starters
and key contributors.

Enacting
social change

New program calls on V
community members to speak
up during risky situations

By Valaree Tang
STAFF WRITER

Green Dot, a power-based personal violence
prevention program that capitalizes on the power of
peer and cultural inﬂuence, is coming to the Wash-
ington and Lee campus.

Green Dot is based on the social change theory,
which targets all members of a community to be
potential bystanders. The strategy targets power in-
equality such as sexual assault, rape, stalking and
other kinds of violence that exploit an imbalanced
power dynamic. Green Dot works to go against this
model by engaging community members through
“awareness, education and skills practice of proac-
tive behaviors that establish intolerance of violence
as the norm,” said Licensed Clinical‘PsychoIogist
Jennifer Sayre of University Counseling Services.

Sayre is working with student organizations
such as I in 4, Speak, KEWL, LIFE and the END
IT campaign in implementing Green Dot at W&L.

The idea behind Green Dot, according to the
University of Kentucky violence prevention web-
site, is to visualize a map, in which power-based
personal violence is represented by red dots, which
continue to spread and ﬁll the map. The objective of
Green Dot is to outshine and displace these red dots
with green dots, which can be anything from pull-
ing a friend out ofa high-risk situation to posting a
supportive F acebook message. I

The Green Dot initiative was developed at the
University of Kentucky by Dr. Dorothy Edwards,
who gave an overview of Green Dot at W&L on
May 3.

“If most of us choose inaction—if most of us
choose to close our eyes to this issueeif most of
us choose apathy and indifferencevthen the red
dots stand! If we do not begin replacing moments
of violence and inaction with moments of support
and safety, then we will su_rely continue to have o_ur
friends, partners, students, colleagues and class-
mates become victims,” said Sayre. who worked
with a team in bringing Green Dot to W&L because
of its potential effectiveness on campus.

The Green Dot strategy asks students to consider
personal safety as a community issue. Speciﬁcally,
the approach encourages students to "think about
their personal role and involvement in making the
campus a safer place.

According to outgoing END IT president Emily
Coyle, W&L has a disproportionately high rate of
sexual assault, compared to the national statistic for
college campuses.

While there are already numerous organizations
on campus that seek to address, prevent and elimi-
nate sexual assault, Green Dot implements a differ-
ent strategy. It is not an organization, but an initia-
tive that involves all community members.

Coyle differentiated that SPEAK and 1 in 4 are
about education and awareness, while END IT is
about working for change in how we address sexual
assault and its prevention on this campus.

“We need Green Dot because it isn’t just another
group. The groups on campus have their purpose,
certainly, but Green Dot is an initiative for every-
one,” said Coyle.

Incoming END IT president Eric Gehman agreed
with Coyle.

“It’s a campaign and training program funded
and organized by the university that will be used in
all sorts of contexts, for any and all groups on cam-
pus who want to make the university a safer place to
be,” Gehman said. “That means fraternities, sorori-
ties, athletic teams, service groups and other student
organizations who want to help end sexual assault
and violence at W&L can be Green Dot-trained and
can help play a role in solving this problem.”

Though Green Dot teaches people to recognize
“red dots,” dangerous situations, or dangerous situ-
ations in which bystanders could act but do not act,
and to teach people to act on those “red dots” with
“green dots” of action - by choosing to intervene or
getting someone to intervene, Coyle believes that
the initiative is not about changing how community
members socialize at W&L.

“It’s about engendering a culture of support in
which we as individuals choose to intervene if we
see a bad situation about to occur because support-
ing one another is the right thing to do,” she said.

About 30 Washington and Lee stu-
dents were injured at an off-campus
party Friday night after the deck they
were standing on collapsed. "

Twenty-two students were treated '

at Carilion Stonewall Jackson Hos-
pital, and all but one were released
by Saturday morning, said Dawn

Watkins, the dean of students, in a -

campus--wide e-mail.

The remaining student underwent
surgery for a compound ankle fracture
Saturday afternoon.

Others were treated at the student
health center.

The accident happened at a house
at the corner ofFurrs Mill and Green-
house roads, known to students as
“County Seat." About 50 people were
standing on the house’s back porch
at I l :30 p.m., when the structure
collapsed beneath them, said Rock-

. bridge County Police Sergeant Hugh

Ferguson.

“We had everybody otmin a timely
manner and on the way to the hospi-
tal,” he said.

The residents of County Seat said
in a statement they felt “grateful for
the fast and effective response ofthe
Rockbridge County police, ﬁre and
medical teams.”

Students had gathered at County
Seat for a beach-themed party—a
kick-off to the Phi Kappa Sigma
fraternity‘s annual “Bahamas” party
during the day on Saturday. Ferguson
said that he did not think the collapsed
porch was the fault of the boys who
live in County Seat.

“A few people live in the house,
but you get a crowd of hundreds, and
accidents happen,” he said. “It’s not
surprising.”

Many students, ofﬁcials and ad-

i “l‘ltI”~Ii”rS.1l:I§4li7[’Zf€l7i’:Ia’G-iiI"e‘€‘

ministrators have now entered an
ongoing debate over whether or not
there iss anyone to blame for the
accident.

County Seat is one of many off-

administrators.

“I don’t think we have been silent
about the choices students make
on and off-campus,” Watkins said.
“From a university perspective, we

these kids do whatever they want. ”

campus rental houses where students
go to party. Some'nearby residents
feel that W&L administrators should
do a betterjob of monitoring student
behavior at off-campus parties.

Philip Welch, a furniture artist who
lives near County Seat with his wife
and young son, has been a Rockbridge
County Resident for four years. He
said he hopes the school will learn
from Friday night’s accident.

“Down here, it’s sort of like it’s
no-man’s land,” said Welch, who
walked down to County Seat when
he heard sirens late Friday night.
“W&Ljust sort of turns its back on
all of this, and these kids do whatever
they want.”

But Watkins disagrees. She said
that she and other university ofﬁcials
address off-campus housing issues
in a variety of ways—from sending
letters home to parents that offer ad-
vice on how to choose an off-campus
house to working with the Campus
Community Coalition in an attempt to
foster better communication between
students, local residents and W&L

.1" t».-’.

On Friday night, the porch at the off-campus ho

try to hit it [off-campus housing] at
every angle."

In a statement, County Seat resi-
dent and W&L junior Jeff Roberts
stressed the responsibility that stu-
dents who host off-campus parties
take upon themselves.

“The collapse of County Seat’s
porch reasserted the importance of
safety planning when hosting an off-
campus social event,” Roberts wrote
in an e-mail. “In a social environment
where gatherings can quickly turn into
overcrowded parties, it is important
for hosts to be pro-actvely cognizant
of potential safety issues.”

Many students place blame on
Mitchell Shaner, the landlord for
County Seat and several other student
houses.

“I deﬁnitely think the landlord has
some responsibility for the accident,”
said Farrell Ulrich, a W&L senior
who was standing in the County Seat
kitchen, which opens onto the p'orch,
when the structure collapsed. Shaner
said he responded to the scene ofthe
accident Friday night as soon as he

  

,,..:

_...._

heard about it.

“My family and I are sincerely
thankful that no one was seriously
hurt,” Shaner said. “Safety has always
been and still is of utmost importance
to us.”

Watkins said that students and
parents can better inform themselves
about the properties available to rent
in and around Lexington by consult-
ing the Virginia Landlord-Tenant
Handbook on the W&L website’s
“Residential Life” page.

Another student was hurt outside
of County Seat this past fall. Liz
Blackwood, a sophomore from Mary-
land, was struck by a Traveller bus in
October. Blackwood was hospitalized
with a fractured left hip. Witnesses of
the event said Blackwood fell beneath
one of Traveller’s rear tires when the
crowd waiting for the safe ride bus
surged forward in an attempt to stop
it and get a ride.

Since Traveller’s inception, the
number of student DUI arrests has
declined signiﬁcantly, Watkins said.’

In the 1990s, about 25 students
were arrested each year for driving
under the influence of alcohol. This
year, only three students received
DUls, according to Watkins.

In an e-mail about the collapsed
porch and resulting student injuries,
Watkins said university ofﬁcials are
cooperating with local police in their
investigation ofthe accident.

  

e.

Twenty-two students were treated at Carilion Stonewall Jackson Hospital. The students who live at the off-campus house
urge party hosts to keep safety in mind at social events.

Travelling abroad

Stockton Bullitt makes sweeping generalizations about how to survive outside the United States this summer

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

The much-too-short spring
term is drawing to a close, and
now we must face the depressing
reality of lives at home. Leaving
Lexington means the beginning
of home-cooked meals, tanning
by the beach and quality barbe-
cue. I simply don’t know how
we’ll survive.

However, there are a good
amount of students who are do—
ing something unique with their
summers. Instead of getting jobs
in America, they choose to travel
internationally.

We have students visiting
every part of the world, from
Shanghai to Barcelona to Ven-
ezuela.

If you are travelling abroad
at some point this summer,
there are a few things you need
to know before you actually go
there. I know, each country has
its own distinbt culture, and mak-
ing broad generalizations about
people is never a good idea to do,
but if KEWL can do it, so can I.

Being a fantastic narcissist,
I have no problem with saying
that I am an apt world traveler,
and therefore I have no problem
telling you that this article alone

  
 

will solve most problems you
encounter outside U.S. borders.
That’s the nice thing about be-
ing American: we’re so high up
on the world power rankings
that we don’t need to deal with
the details when it comes to any
country who isn’t us. So, wheth-
er you’re staying in Mexico or
Bangladesh, using most of these
guidelines shouldn’t get you into
any trouble.

The ﬁrst and most important
thing to remember when travel-
ling abroad is that you will drink
and smoke more than you do here
in Lexington. I don’t care if you
spend your Tuesday nights get-
ting asked to leave at Macado’s
or attending RUF, there are two
altruisms outside the U.S.: you
will drink regardless of who you
are and any 10 year-old can out-
drink you easily. Smoking ciga-
rettes is optional and depends
more on the country you’re
visiting, but again if you think
you’re on a path to emphysema,
you haven’t left the country. As
you’ve no doubt thought about
while riding in the backseat of a
LexPo vehicle, alcohol standards
outside the U.S. are relaxed, but

what that really means is that
anyone and everyone can throw
down shots without blinking.
Well, that is unless you’re vaca-
tioning in Saudi Arabia, probably
the only country that we could
actually beat in the “Beerlym-
pics.” Oh yeah, prepare for some
bitter morning hangovers, too,
especially when it comes time to
write an opinion article.

You’re also going to have to
know how to smile and nod or
frown and shake your head. I
don’t care ifyou’re visiting Aus-
tralia, you won’t understand half
the things anyone tells you. So in
casual conversation with a local,
learn how to clear your face of
any emotion whatsoever while
the other person is talking. Give
him or her the same blank stare
lecture halls give professors
when they ask a question about
the reading nobody did. Once
the local finishes his or her com-
ment, you respond by making
eye contact, smiling and nodding
either nonchalanlly or emphati-
cally depending on how excited
the local seems.

Only in cases when the local
ends his sentence with a par-

isn’t that hard

ticularly low inﬁection do you
change your blank expression to
a half frown and maybe a little
shake of the head if you’re feel-
ing particularly dangerous. But
trust me, there are much fewer
issues with nodding and smil-
ing at a local saying “and then
the avalanche killed 10 people”
compared with solemnly frown-
ing at a joke. - ~

I know this is contrary to
popular opinion, but you can
always blame the ﬁrst circum-
stance on being an idiotic Ameri-
can, whereas the second circum-
stance causes the local to think
twice about trusting someone
who doesn’t like hisjokes.

I Take the time to learn at least
some of the local language. If
you’re travelling abroad for the
sole purpose of leaming~local
languages then you’re in luck,
but if you don’t really have any
interest in learning Thai, Arabic
or British English, then there are
three phrases that will get you
far: “thank you,” “sorry” and
“stupid American.”

Other than maybe some ador-
ably cheesy pickup line, you
don’t really need much more to

survive in a country. As long as
you can point to yourself and
say “stupid American” in the lo-
cal language, even jihadists will
laugh to themselves and brush off
any wrong you’ve caused. Inter-
nationals are so tired of Ameri-
can tourists not taking the time to
even try their local language that
they will adore any attempt you
make at meeting them halfway.
Likewise, when conversing
with internationals, you need to
remember three things. First, talk
as little as possible (this is when
the smile and nod technique
comes in real handy). Second,
[insert country here] surpasses
the U.S. in every category imag-
inable. Third, the speaker is way
funnier and smarter than you. In
any country, the people who take
the most time out of their day to
talk to foreigners are usually a
pretty weird bunch. They make
up for their domestic inadequa-
cies by vicariously living through
their introduction of their home
country to ignorant tourists.
Because of this, they are in-
clined to make up for their low
self-esteem by bragging to these
seemingly ignorant tourists. They

will gladly let themselves go on
for hours about how the United
States is turning into Greece, and
how [insert country here] may
not have the most powerful gov-
ernment, but they have the most
sensible and secretly ingenious
people. While these people go on
about‘how great their country is,
it helps to keep in mind that the
U.S. is ranked number one in the
world for a reason.

The last and most important
piece of advice to remember
when travelling abroad is to fall
in love. Whether you’re falling
in love with the architecture, the
delicacies or someone you meet
at a club, make sure you leave
the country wishing for just a
little more time, and who knows
maybe you can leave your indel-
ible mark on that country. Hope-
fully that mark doesn’t take nine
months to come to fruition. But
even if ‘it does, you have all the
more reason to come back.

In defense of athletes

In light of the death at U- Va, all must be aware of the
actions around them, not just blame student athletes

Dear Editor,

As the details behind Yeard-
ley Love’s tragic death continue
to unfold, the sport of lacrosse
and athletics in general will

continue to receive negative at- ’

tention and scrutiny. The media
has been quick to condemn our
society for granting athletes an
unrealistic sense of entitlement
and mitigating the consequences
of improper behavior.

Among this scrutiny is a re-
cent article in the May 10 issue
of the Phi, which suggests a link
between male student athletes
and violent behavior towards

women. As a men’s lacrosse
player and sports fan, this gen-
eralization troubles me. On this

campus, student athletes are held,

to the same standards of honor,
civility and integrity as any other
student. Actually, in my experi-
ence, student athletes are held
to higher standards of conduct,
since we are responsible for
representing this university and
community on and off the ﬁeld.
In any case, the occurrence
of gender-based violence cannot
be ignored. The important thing
moving forward is the lessons
learned by the tragedy at U—Va.

As classmates, teammates and’

Panhel on Derby’ Days

Sigma Chi is invited to be on task force

\

Dear Editor,

We write to clarify references
in the article “A Bone to Pick with
Panhellenic.”

In May 2009, a letter was
sent from the then-Panhellenic
President to Sigma Chi Frater-
nity requesting changes to Derby
Days.

Our goal was to support Sigma
Chi, Derby Days and, simultane-
ously, support sorority women
by encouraging a safe event in
keeping with the values of our
organizations. '

Panhellenic suggested utiliz-
ing Campus Recreation Ofﬁcials
for Powder Puff, providing sober
drivers to and ‘from all events held
off campus, developing a clear
point system, having t-shirts with
a philanthropic focus and meeting
with Panhellenic during Winter
Term 2010 to review the changes
and have dialogue regarding the
event

There is no doubt that Derby
Days has seen improvements.
However, we still have concern
about both safety and the appro-
priateness of some events.

Panhellenic Council takes
seriously its role of supporting
women by encouraging events
that are safe. We also take seri-
ously supporting Greek Life in
its entirety by doing all we can to
make sure events are carried out
in a manner that reflects chapters’
values.

Panhellenic has formed a task
force to evaluate the women’s
contribution to Derby Days.
Sigma Chi has been invited to
participate on the task force. We

look forward to working with
Sigma Chi in support of women
students and in support of Greek
Life at W&L.

most rewarding aspects qfleadership at W&L? I find it very
rewarding to help other people, and I feel that taking on a lead-
ership position gives me the opportunity to touch the lives of
friends, acquaintances and even strangers. Whether you are
planning a fun activity or helping somebody with a problem,
being a leader allows you to see how your efforts and influence
can make somel)ody's day (or even their year) a little better.
What legacy ofleadership doyou hope to leavefor others
who follow you here? I hope that I leave behind me a legacy of
hard work and determination, along with enthusiasm for new
ideas. I hope that the future leaders of W&L work hard to pre-
serve our beloved traditions, but at the same time realize that
some of the best leaders are those who take a unique approach
to problems and do things a little bit differently.

Any words ofadvicefor them? Definitely do not be afraid to
take on new challenges or try something "impossible". You will
be amazed to discover just how much you can accomplish, but
you will never find out unless you try.

WLUR’s hot tunes

Last-minute suggestions for summer playlist

By WLUR Staff
STAFF WRITERS

Let these great new records kick

start your proverbial summer playlist:
The Hold Steady
Heaven is Whenever (Vagrant)

Tweetable version: This isn’t the
best Hold Steady record, but it’s still
a great one.

Full version: The Hold Steady is
back with what Craig Finn and Co.
have declared as a “new, more stripped-
down sound” in contrast to their previ-
ous sprawling Springsteen-meets-Ken
ouac brand of classic-indie rock. (For
more of that. check out a their previ-
ous records—Separation Sunday, Boys
and Girls in America. Almost Killed
Me, and Stay Positive, in that order.)
They can still do the beefy rockers (see
“The Smidge,” the one with cowbell
that would make Christopher Walken
proud) alongside the tender ballads
(see “We Can Get Together,” deﬁnitely
‘the records strongest moment).

But despite the use of the word
“heaven” in what seems like every oth-
er song, the record feels less complete
to me. They’re still clever in the lines
they spin and the licks they bust out:
catchy-as-hell “Hurricane J” and the
1-2-3 punch of the records ﬁrst three
tracks showcase these traits nicely.
Still, despite these standout tracks, I
find myself only casually listening to
the rest. Sure, The Steady can't ride the
concept album shtick into the ground,
but no matter how repetitive their sto-
ries might be, they’re so damn irresist-
ible.

The Mynabirds

What We Lose in the Fire We Gain

in the Flood (Saddle Creek)

The Mynabirds is the new project of
singer/songwriter Laura Burhenn, who
most recently was half ofthe duo Geor-
gie James. Along with John Davis (ex-
Q and Not U, and currently the driv-
ing force behind Title Tracks, whose
record It Was Easy graced our playlist
back in the winter), those two put out
the LP Places in 2007. It was enjoyable
indie pop, but ultimately it was noth-
ing that hadn’t been done before. In the
end, you could see why they called it_
quits soon thereafter.

As The Mynabirds, Burhenn is com-
pletely in her element on the soul-in-
fused folk record What We Lose in the
Fire We Gain in the Flood. This is right
in the vein of Jenny Lewis, especially
her first solo LP, and Cat Power~l’ll
claim that it‘s as good as anything that
they‘ve ever released—as well as clas-
sic pop touchstones like Dusty Spring-
field and Carole King. Burhenn’s a
terriﬁc songwriter with an absolutely
stunning voice, and this style ﬁts her

much, much better than indie rock ever
did. Produced by Richard Swift, the LP
is neither too sparse nor too cluttered,
with Burhenn’s vocals always leading
the way.

My favorites include “Numbers
Don’t Lie,” “Let the Record Go,”
“Ways of Looking” and “We Made a
Mountain.”

The New Pornographers
Together (Matador)

The inimitable Canadian indie rock
powerhouse that is The New Pomeg-
raphers returns with its ﬁfth album of
power pop bliss. As if a lineup featur-
ing Neko Case, A.C. Newman and Dan
Bejar (Destroyer) weren’t enough to
draw in your attention, Together fea-
tures guest work from Okkervil River
frontman Will Sheff (vocals on opener
“Moves”), St. Vineent’s ‘Annie Clark
(guitar on “My Shepherd”), Beirut’s
Zach Condon (trumpet on “A Bite Out
of My Bed”) and the Dap-Kings (horns
on several tracks).

Be sure to check out the Case-front-
ed “Crash Years” and the Case/New-
man duet “Your Hands (Together),”
as well as Bejar’s always-distinctive
contributions, including “Silver Jenny
Dollar” and “Daughters of Sorrow.”

Tobacco
Maniac Meat (Anticon)

Tobacco, the mastermind behind
techno-pop group Black Moth Super
Rainbow, was hard at work compos-
ing Maniac Meat, the newest addition
to his solo repertoire, while putting the
ﬁnishing touches on BMSR’s newest
and more mainstream record Eating
Us. While listening to Eating Us, I of-
ten wondered how Tobacco managed
to suppress his more experimental side.
The answer is that he didn’t. He fun-
neled it all into Maniac Meat.

This album takes the older, heavier
style of BMSR and makes it heavier.
It’s so thick with guttural fuzz you can
taste it. There is not a single pure noise
in the whole album. Everything is dirty,
affected, distorted, twisted.

The hip-hop/funk drums are simul-
taneously atmospheric and driving.
And well, I would categorize the other
“instruments,” but really it’s all just
intense club noise in chords that are
borderline I2-tone. The funk is unstop-
pable. This stuff will get anyone’_s head
bobbing.

It’s all strange, and it all feels so
right. Maniac Meat has a life of its own,
a solid relentless pulse beating life into
the body of a giant mechanized insect.
A must-play for any DJ looking to un-
earth some truly novel sounds.

THE RING-TUM PHI '5

Women’s lax

Down 13-9 with just seven
minutes left to play, W&L staged
a furious rally, crashing the net
and consistently testing the Blue
Jays’ stout defense. Freeman
scored twice and Mathews once
to cut the deﬁcit to one in the
waning moments.

Rapid

After senior midﬁelder Ju-
lia Gotwald won the post-goal
draw, fouls were called on two
Elizabethtown players, giving
Mathews a free position shot that
would tie the game. But goalie
Rachel Waldman made the save,
and a follow—up shot by Megargel

sailed high. The Generals would
not get another opportunity, and
Elizabethtown advanced to the
Toumament’s second round.

The Generals’ offense put
steady pressure on the Jays the
entire match, recording 34 shots,
but Waldman’s ll-save perfor-

mance bailed out the Elizabeth-
town defense numerous times.
For Freeman, it was a memo-
rable last game. The senior con-
verted on half of her 12 shots,
giving her 30 goals on the season
despite starting just nine games.
She ﬁnishes her career with 90

goals over four years.

Despite W&L‘s ﬁrst round
exit, the future is bright for the
team. It will lose just four se-
niors, as defenders Gotwald and

Rockbridge County is Valley League team, the Rockbridge Rapids, includes two VMI standouts

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

With the Washington and Lee
baseball team done for the year,
Cap’n Dick Smith Field lays dor-
mant. That is, however, until the
Rockbridge Rapids make it their‘
home ﬁeld. for this summer’s
2010 Valley League season.

This will be the Rapids’ sec-
ond season in the prestigious
summer league. The Valley
League is supported by Major
League Baseball and consists of
eleven privately owned franchis-
es based in Virginia’s Shenando-
ah Valley. Founded in 1923, the
league has evolvediinto a sum-
mer wood-bat league for college

- players similar to the Cape Cod

League in Massachusetts. Since
its inception, the Valley League
has been a pipeline to the pros

LeBron James: A dream put on

for collegiate players. Well over
1,000 alumni have played pro-
fessionally, including thirteen
Major Leaguers. Players such as
Brandon Inge, Aubrey Huff and
World Series MVPs Mike Low-
ell and David Eckstein all spent
a summer playing in the league
at one point.

Rockbridge’s inaugural cam-
paign last year was a struggle.
Even with a roster ﬁlled .with
players hailing from baseball
powerhouses 3 like Miami (FL),
Stanford and Tennessee, _ the
Rapids stumbled to a 9-33 re-
cord and missed the playoffs.
But a few bright spots were Sam
Roberts and Alan Watts, both of

. whom attend VMI. Roberts led

the team in hitting with a .291

average, while Watts was lights-
out as a reliever, earning All-Star
recognition with a 0.73 ERA and
33 strikeouts in 24 innings.

Both players will be back this
season in the navy, white, and
gold Rockbridge once their VMI
season is completed. Roberts has
shined this year for the Keydets,
receiving recognition as a ﬁnal-
ist for the John Olerud Two-Way
Player of the Year award fo; I.is
work at both shortstop and on
the mound. He also is one of 25
quarterﬁnalists for the Brooks
Wallace award, given to the na-
tion’s best collegiate shortstop.

Thirty-three other players
from schools such as the College
of Charleston, West Virginia,
Davidson and Virginia Com-

monwealth will also play for the
Rapids. Head Coach Greg Ke-
aton says the team is composed
of“guys who really want to play

andihave something to prove”.

Some other notables include
Chris Z_bin and Robert Skinner.
Zbin is a sophomore left-hander
at Southern Connecticut State.
He' posted a 7-2 record with
a 2.29 ERA in 12 starts while
striking out 100 in 78 innings
of work. In addition to being a
ﬁrst team Northeast-10 selec-
tion, Zbin is one of35 candidates
for the Tino Martinez Division
11 Baseball Player of the Year
Award. Skinner is a junior third
baseman for Lander University.
He hit .352 with 32 RBIs and
set school records this year for

runs and walks and was named
an All-Peach Belt Conference
selection.

Beyond Roberts and Watts,
Keaton’s squad is features all
new faces. His coaching staff
for the upcoming season is also
brand—new. The management
team of GM Ken Newman and
President Jim Crothers brought
in Steve Crosier, Evan Wise
and J.R. Blevins to help lead the
Rapids.

“They all have winning base-
ball backgrounds” Keaton said,
“They understand we want play-
ers who play the game hard and
want to prove themselves as D-I
and pro prospects."

Cleveland Cavaliers ’latest playoﬂ failure could be last straw for star LeBron James

By Adam Cancryn
SPORTS EDITOR

It was never supposed to end
like this.

Fresh off a dominant 6I—win
regular season, the Cleveland
Cavaliers were expected to cruise
through the playoffs, dispatch-
ing the lesser teams en route to
an NBA title that would reignite
Cleveland sports and crown LeB-
ron James as the rightful king of
the league. Confetti would rain
down on cheering fans as James
announced his plan to spend his
career in Cleveland, marking the
dawn of a dynasty.

Instead, it ended with LeBron
slinking off the court in Boston,
removing his Cavaliersjersey for
what might be the last time as he
retreated to the locker room.

For seven years LeBron has
ruled the basketball world with
his effortless play and incredible

athleticism. At 26, he has accom-
plished more than most ever do in
a career. But the most important
accomplishment, a championship,
continues to elude him. And after
this latest debacle, LeBron is
likely done waiting for everything
to come together in Cleveland.
Perhaps no team since the
I997-98 Chicago Bulls has been
as good as this year’s Cava-
liers. While other teams have
posted better records, Cleveland’s
superiority extended past the
win column. The Cavs received
consistent contributions from
12 players, easily incorporated
newcomers Shaquille O’Neal
and Antawn Jamison and simply
overwhelmed opponents with
their size and speed. Most games
this season ended with LeBron
resting easily on the bench, jok-

ing with his teammates while
the reserves ﬁnished off another
blowout victory.

But underneath that domi-
nant facade existed a signiﬁcant
weakness that the Boston Celtics
exposed last week: the Cavs have
not yet found a suitable “sidekick”
to support James.

This season, LeBron led the
league in win shares, or the esti-
mated number of victories con-
tributed by a single player, for
the second consecutive year with
18.5. That means that one player
was responsible for nearly one-
third of Cleveland’s wins this
year. The next closest was Ander-
son Varejao, with 8.1.

The supposed supporting cast
of Mo Williams, Shaq and Jamison
managedjust I 1.9 combined.

And when a mysterious elbow

injury limited James’ scoring
ability, the effect of these statis-
tics became clear. No one could
consistently penetrate the Celtics
defense, leaving Cleveland with
no plan beyond giving the ball
to LeBron.

Facing adversity for perhaps
the ﬁrst time all year, the Cavs
could not respond. They were out-
hustled and outworked by spark-
plug point guard Rajon Rondo and
a trio of aging stars.

While it was certainly a disap-
pointing ﬁnish for Cleveland and
its fans, the team’s lack ofquality
role players could mean more bad
news for the Cavs.

Speculation has swirled for
nearly two years around LeBron
and his upcoming free agency.
While the Cavs were busy breez-
ing through the regular season,

it appeared James could not be
happier to stay put. The pieces
appeared in place for a successful
title run.

But the team‘s early exit seems
to have changed all that, and the
players around LeBron that served
as Cleveland’s biggest selling
point are no longer enticing.

Were James to re—sign with the
Cavs, the team would have little
ability to change the personnel
around him. Jamison, Williams
and big men Varejao and J.J.
Hickson will all likely return, and
odds are no major additions would
be made.

On the other hand, New York,
New Jersey, Chicago and the
Los Angeles Clippers have all
emerged as suitors with enough
cash to build a team around
James.

offense that outscored opponents

son, but it will still be an uphill
battle. The defending champion
Haymarket Senators, along with
the Covington Lumberjacks,
Waynesboro Generals and the
Winchester Royals are all proven
teams that will provide a stiff test
for the Rapids. However, there is
a lot of turnover on these rosters,
so predicting can be tough. Re-
gardless, the Rapids should be
much improved.

With a year under their belts,
$5 tickets, talented local stars
and beautiful Lexington weather,
the Rapids will provide a com-
petitive and exciting baseball
experience all summer long. The
season opens June 4 at home ver-
sus the Staunton Braves.

hold

Though none are nearly as
talented as the Cavs are currently,
each has enough potential to be
an intriguing option for LeBron.
The Knicks have the ability to
sign two maximum contracts,
while the other three already have
players that might potentially ﬁll
that sidekick role James sorely
needs.

Though his future is still ques-
tionable, this much is clear: LeB-
ron’s priorities have changed over
the past two weeks. He will not
choose a team for the challenge, or
the prestige or‘ the loyalty shown
to him. He will choose the team
that is built to win new.

The Washington and Lee men’s tennis team finished the year 16-9 and won the ODAC tournament. The
women also claimed an ODAC title en route to a 19-6 record.

Tennis falls at NCAAs

Women, men eliminated by Emorjy in tourney is third round 1‘

By Jayna Johns
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s men’s and wom-
en’s tennis teams ﬁnished their seasons last
weekend after advancing to the third round
of the NCAA Division lll tournament,
concluding what amounted to a successful
season for each team.

The women’s season ended in Atlanta,
Ga. on Sunday after a 5-0 loss to fourth-
ranked Emory, a team the Generals had
beaten earlier in the season 5-4. W&L is

out the tournament. it marked the 20th
ODAC Championship for W&L Women’s
Tennis overjust 25 years.

In addition to the team championship,
the General‘s brought home several indi-
vidual awards and recognitions. Senior
Lauren Caire was named the ODAC Player
of the Year, and six players were named to
the All-ODAC First Team. in addition to
Caire, sophomores Ellen Yeatman, Ann

Six players from the women’s team and seven from the men’s re-
ceived All-ODAC honors. Senior Lauren Caire was selected as ODAC

Player of the Year.

ranked sixth nationally. it concluded a 19-
6 season for the women.

Most notably, the team dominated in the
ODAC Championships, winning the title
without dropping a single match through-

Morris, Lauren Lukas and Jen Snyder and
senior Blair Brzeski were all awarded the
First Team honor. '

The honors for Caire did not end in the
conference. She was also chosen as an All-

American and one of W&L’s numerous
Student-Athletes, bringing in a GPA of at
least 3.5.

While the season has ended for the team,
Caire and Yeatman’s seasons are not quite
over. They were two of 32 athletes nation-
ally selected to compete in the NCAA In-
dividual Championships for singles com-
petition. The two were also selected to
compete in the championship as a doubles
team, one of only 16 teams chosen.

Five seniors from the team will be
graduating next week. Lauren Dorse‘_ ', Ka-
tie Harris and Lyndsey Johansson will join
Caire and Brzeski.

The outlook for the teams next couple
of years seems promising, as it is loaded
with talented sophomores and ﬁrst-years
with a handful ofjuniors.

The 25th-ranked men's team ended
their season with a 5-0 loss to 2nd-ranked
Emory University, ﬁnishing a 16-‘) season.

Like the women, the men dominated
the ODAC Tournament, dropping just
three games, all of which came in the
toumament’s ﬁnal match against Hamp-
ton-Sydney. Hampton-Sydney had taken
last year’s conference championship from
W&L in addition to a match this season,
so this victory was particularly meaningful
for the team.

Also like the women’s team, the men
had one standout in particular who picked
up a number of honors. First-year All-
American Hayden White was selected as
the ODAC Rookie of the Year, in addition
to being the only General from the men’s
team invited to play in the NCAA Individ-
ual Championships.

The men had seven players selected
to All-ODAC teams, both First Team and
Second Team. For First Team singles,
junior Will Hall and senior Cliff Gaddy
joined White. White was also selected to
the first team in doubles, where Hall and
sophomores Jeremy Becht and Mac Davis
joined him. For the second team, Davis,
Becht and sophomore Michael Freeman
were all honorees for singles, while senior
Alex and sophomore Jonathan Gaffney

were honored for doubles.

In addition to the talents on the court,
two players were also recognized as W&L
Student-Athletes. Will Hall was honored
for attaining a 4.0 GPA, while Hayden
White recorded above a 3.5.

The men will lose only Alex Brooke
and Cliff Gaddy next year.

The three Generals who will continue
their seasons in the NCAA Individual
Tournament willstart play on May 28. The
women will play at the University of Mary
Washington, while White will travel to
Oberlin College for the competition.

Women’s lax comes up short

Late rally not enough as Generals are eliminated from NCAA Tournamen

By Adam Cancryn
SPORTS EDITOR

A late-game surge fell just short for the
Washington and Lee women’s lacrosse
team, as the 14th-ranked Generals lost to
Elizabethtown, 13-12, in the ﬁrst round of
the NCAA Tournament on Wednesday.

Senior attacker Meredith Freeman
scored a season-high six goals and junior
midfielder Emmy Mathews chipped in
four goals and an assist, but Elizabethtown
turned away a free position shot with 2:43
left to seal the victory. V

In a back-and-forth affair that saw six
lead changes, the two teams put on an of-
fensive display. Elizabethtown struck ﬁrst

on attacker Megan Byrnes’ ﬁrst of three
scores. But W&L respondedjust two min-
utes-later, tying it on a goal by junior at-
tacker Wilton Megargel.

The teams would trade tallies before
a three-goal run put Elizabethtown up 5-
3 with just over 12 minutes remaining in
the ﬁrst half. The Generals kept the game
within reach, however, as sophomore at-
tacker Maddie McKaig, Mathews and
Freeman each found the backlof the net off
of unassisted efforts. ‘

Tied 6-6 going into the second half,
Elizabethtown’s offense wasted little time.

The Blue Jays scored just 37 seconds into
the period to take the lead and put W&L on
