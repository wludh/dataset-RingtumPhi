 Not your grandparents’

Johnson gift, Strategic Plan lead to record ﬁrst-year class and changing demographics

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF WRITER

The 259 men and 238 women who just experi-
enced their ﬁrst Washington and Lee Orientation
Week have already secured a place in the school’s
history: the class of 2015 is the largest ever to walk
the Colonnade. ‘

To put this 497-student class into perspective, the
class of 2014 had 471 students as of October 2010,
the class of 2013 had 472 as of October 2009, and
the class of 2012 had 454 as of October 2008.

Provost Robert Strong says the larger-than-
average class size was not intended. The school’s
yield—the percentage of accepted students who de-

cided to attend W&L—went up this year, resulting
in the larger freshman class.

The yield for Johnson scholarship offers also in-
creased. The class of 2014 has 34 Johnson scholars
in it, while this year’s freshman class has 53. lfyou
average these two numbers, you get about 44 John-
son scholars per class, which is the target that the
university shoots for each year.

Going co—ed

W&L is changing. Data collected by the univer-
sity show a steady evolution of the student body
since 1985—the ﬁrst year women were admitted to
W&L.

In 1985, 105 freshmen women and 10 upper-
class women transfer students began attending
classes at W&L, according to an article from The
Washington Postpublished in September 1985.

Today, more than 25 years later, women make
up almost exactly 50 percent of the undergraduate
degree-seeking population. According to data from
the Ofﬁce of Institutional Effectiveness’ Common
Data Sets, women overtook men as the majority of
the undergraduate degree-seeking population for the
ﬁrst time at the start of the 2009-2010 school year.
The student population that year was 49.86 percent
male and 50.14 percent female. With such a small
total student body, however, for all intents and pur-

poses the split was 50/50 that academic year and last
academic year (2010-201 1) as well.

Back in 1985, not everyone was excited about
the change. According to the same Washington Post
article, then-student body president John B. Lewis
said he felt “betrayed” by the school because he be-
lieved changes to the campus were being made too
quickly.

In an opinion piece published last year, fonner
student Michele Farquharson said that her own fa-
ther was originally against the idea of coeducation
at W&L, even going so far as to adhere ‘a bumper
sticker to his car that read “W&L,
Better Off Dead than Co-ed.”

In 1985, women made up about
8.5 percent of the undergraduate
' student population. But the male to
female ratio has been close to 1:1 for
several years now, and the university
has begun to focus its efforts on di-
versifying the W&L student body in
other ways, according to the univer-
sity’s strategic plan.

The Strategic Plan

In 2007, the university revealed a

plan outlining its goals for the next
decade of new student recruitment
and other aspects of running the uni-
versity.
I Debbie Dailey, assistant provost
10 for the university’s Ofﬁce of Institu-
tional Effectiveness, compiles and analyzes the de-
mographics ofthe university each year. She said she
hasn’t noticed any big changes.

She did say that a more diverse student body has
been a goal of university administrators ever since
she began working here four years ago.

“I think a lot ofeffort is being expended by W&L
to increase the diversity of the student body,” said
Dailey. But she also

undergone “dramatic changes” over the past decade.
According to the May 201 1 Board Book-- prepared
for the Board ofTrustees --in the year 2000 the uni-
versity allocated $10.3 million to its ﬁnancial aid
budget. By 2010. that number had more than tripled
to $34.1 million.

This year’s ﬁnancial aid budget, which has not
been ﬁnalized, sits at about $32 million, says James
Islaster, Director of liinancial Aid at “W&L.

Kaster says the university is “absolutely” offer-
ing more need-based aid now than it has in the past,
thanks in large part to the Johnson gift.

says that because of the program W&L is “compet-

was before.

The timing of the Johnson gift allowed the uni-
versity to continue to offer higher levels of ﬁnancial
aid despite the downturn in the economy.

“It’s a big commitment,” Kaster says. But, he
adds, “the university is beneﬁtting like crazy from

According to Strong, Johnson scholars had an
average GPA of 3.642 after last winter term. Of
the 20 students inducted _into the Phi Beta Kappa
academic honor society last year, 11 were Johnson
scholars, and half of the students inducted into the
Omicron Delta Kappa national leadership honor so-
ciety were Johnson scholars.

That doesn‘t mean Johnson scholars are the only
movers and shakers on campus. But Kaster says
that the university’s ability to bring in brighter and
brighter Johnson scholar students spurs the entire
W&L student body to strive for academic improve-
ment.

Dailey says she believes the university is “mak-
ing great efforts to enhance [the] experiences of
students by increasing the diversity that is here,”
largely through the Johnson Scholarship program.

“[W&L] is diverse,” says Kaster. “You have to
think ofthe history."

Extreme home makeover: Washington and Lee edition

English department, Alpha Delta Pi and ﬁeld hockey team get new homes thanks to summer construction projects

By Leigh Dannhauser
5 TA F F w R I T E R

Returning students may have noticed a slightly
modiﬁed campus, thanks to Washington and Lee‘s
annual summer makeover.

Payne Hall, the English depar1m'ent’s home
on the Colonnade, now features two refurbished
classrooms, the department library, larger ofﬁces,
wheelchair access to the ﬁrst floor, a separate con-
ference room on the ﬁrst floor and a student lounge
area on the second ﬂoor.-

“For the ﬁrst time, English faculty can meet stu-
dents inappropriately sized, comfortable offices.
A more professional atmosphere has been created,
without sacriﬁcing comfort,” said department chair
Suzanne Keen. .

Keen said she hopes the lounge will encourage
students to spend more time in the building. “We

see the renovated building as a home for the liter-
ary arts,” she said. . ‘

Meanwhile, the restoration of Washington Hall
is underway. The project will be similar to the res-
toration of Newcomb and Payne halls. Unlike those
buildings, the refurbished Washington Hall will
feature an “Honored Benefactors Wall,” according
to a W&L news release.,The wall will contain the
names ofthose individuals who have given $1 mil-
lion or more to the school.

Away from‘ the Colonnade, the women ofAlpha
Delta Pi ﬁnally moved into their newly completed
house.

“lt’s nice having a place to.call your own,” said
sophomore Bella Zuroski.

During their ﬁrst couple of years on campus,

members of ADPi lived on a designated hall in
Gaines. Chapter meetings were held in the Hillel
House on Mondays, and the sisters had chapter din-
ners together on Tuesday nights in the Kappa Delta
house.

The house “brings it all together,” Zuroski said.

On the athletic front, the ﬁeld hockey turf was
replaced this summer.

The Generals continue to compete on a carpet

turf, the only team to do so in the Old Dominion

Athletic Conference. Other teams in the conference
use ﬁeld turf, similar to the football turf, on which
the ball is slower.

, Although the same type ofturf is used, the new
turf has its differences. The old turf, which was
also used for intramurals and as the alternate ﬁeld

for soccer, football and lacrosse, had worn down.
There also have been improvements in the produc-
tion of the surface since the old turf was installed
ten years ago.

A major difference is the addition of a sprinkler
system. The turf gets watered before each game to
make it safer for the players.

“The water makes it safer for your face, and if
you fall you don’t get burnt,” said sophomore de-
fender Riley Hampsch.

The next game on the new turf is September
l7 at 2 p.m.

Rules are rules for a reason  

Campbell Burr explains how following the system helped her escape unwanted attention at work and in school

My ﬁrst day
of work, my
boss told me that
my pants were
too tight.

, Yes, they
. were skin-tight,
but that’s how
they were «sup-
posed to ﬁt. I
was informed
- that I was in
violation of the
restaurant’s rule
that all bussers
and servers were
to wear “docker” style slacks, a.k.a.
the most unflattering, shapeless pants
in the world. Considering I was work-
ing for tips, not a hospital, the restric-
tion seemed a little counterproductive.
To add insult to injury, on top we wore
short-sleeved button-down shirts a la
1998 Limited Too. Yuck. Going into the
summer, I couldn’t imagine why some-
one in a position of authority would
want to put me through such torture.

As my summer unfolded, I began to
understand. Among the mostly normal,
friendly wait and kitchen staff, I dis-
covered a few characters who gave me
pause. Bill, a bartender in his late ﬁf-
ties, was one of these creepers. He was
balding on either side of his head and
had wide arms that would have looked

large, round belly protruded from under-
neath each of his Hawaiian shirts. An-
other busgirl had been forbidden from
going near the bar because Bill had once
ordered that she turn around so he could
give her a neck massage. Rumor had it
that he had asked another young employ-
ee on a date. Because one of my respon-
sibilities as a busgirl was bringing dirty

comment came lots of genuine compli-
ments. I could not decide whether to be

weird-

ness was only his odd sense of humor
and I blamed myself for thinking that his
words were creepy rather than ﬁinny. On
my second night of work, Bill watched
from behind the bar as I stacked glasses
by the dishwasher. “Give it to me baby,”
he said in a deep, raspy voice.

,When I looked up, a little taken
aback, he continued. “You can take that
anyway you want.” Not knowing how
to react, I looked down and smiled.

given him a greener light if I tried.

Bill’s next move was begging me to
run away with him. For a week, every

On one horrible occasion, Bill
teamed up with Jeff, a short waiter in his
forties who was also anxious to speak to
young waitresses. Another busgirl and
I were preparing to clear a table while
Bill and Jeff began jokingly ﬁghting.
We had trays and towels and were on the
way out to the dining room when Bill
stopped us.

and whip Jeff with them.”

Jeff smiled at us and then looked
back at Bill. “The only problem, Bill, is
that I would really enjoy that.” Eeek.

“What are your tattoos?” I
asked.

“Oh, well this one on my left
arm is of the Grim Reaper, got it
after my divorce. And my other
one,” he said as he inched his
shirt to expose his left chest—
very appropriate for work—“is a
heart with my children’s names
in the center.” His children, apparently,
had been estranged for four years.

Later on that night, he asked if I was
considering getting a tattoo. I told him
no, but he made it his goal for the night
to recommend a design and placement
that I would like. His ﬁrst recommenda-
tion was a picture of the globe on my
ankle. “For Earth Day,” he said. Riiiight.
When I told him I enjoyed reading and
writing, he suggested a tattoo of my
favorite book open on my arm. “Some-
thing meaningful,” he explained. I can-
not even repeat Bill’s ﬁnal tattoo recom-
mendation.

Sweetheart say the word “like” during
the millionth argument between herself
and Ronnie? In addition, how much are
these fools getting paid to drink, party,
ﬁght and not speak Italian?

The answer is simple. The “Snitch-
uation” has reportedly brokered a deal
with MTV that will land each cast mem-
ber $100,000 an episode for a thirteen
episode season. If you thought you had
it good going to a top liberal arts institu-
tion, think again.

If only I were Italian, I could have
pretended to be from New Jersey and
ruined a perfectly good family beach
Vacation spot. I instead took the color-
ful route of being Irish and pursuing an
accounting degree. I am so interesting.
Child please.

OK, enough with the hatred. I actu-
ally enjoy the show and have been an
avid viewer since day one. Since we
are all fans of the beloved show, I am
sure we have all seen the trailer display-
ing highlights of the upcoming season.

There were some pretty shocking and
graphic events that presented them-
selves in this preview.

Since the entire world (and your sis-
ter’s sister) heard news earlier this year
that Snooki ran her car into the back of
a police car, the trailer had to show foot-
age of this event. In classic style, Snoo-

lenses are actually slabs of black plastic.
In the world of eyewear, this would be
classiﬁed as a “sleeping mask.”
Footage in the trailer also shows a
fairly intense verbal argument between
the Situation and Ronnie that appears
to turn into a physical altercation. Ob-
viously no punches are shown in the

tion for the ladies, and Snooki does not matter. Ever.

ki stopped paying attention to the road
just long enough to ram her vehicle into
a Florence policeman’s rear, ricocheting
it into a nearby guardrail. The cause of
this accident is unclear, although early
speculation shows that Snooki’s sun-
glasses are so deeply tinted that the

preview, but we do see the Situation
unconscious and lying on the ground ac-
companied by paramedics. I think it’s
safe to say that Ronnie’s record has just
improved to 4-0 with three knockouts
lifetime.

The episode portraying this ordeal

A week from my last day, Bill called
me over to the bar to share an idea he
had. He suggested that instead of thank-
ing each other every time he took a glass
off of my tray, we say something else.
When he shared his idea for that “some-
thing else,” I did not smile. Rather, I
considered suggesting an addendum
to the employee code that consisted of
forbidding makeup and requiring cen-
ter hair parts. If I was getting this much
unwanted attention looking like an old
maid, I could not imagine what would
have ensued had I dressed in my pre-
ferred clothing.

My take-away from the summer: the
rules are there for a reason. Naturally,
we complain about some of the rules
at W&L—no smoking in the donns, no
kegs in fraternity houses, no open con-
tainers on Traveller—but they may be
important to follow. Dressing in baggy
clothes every day for work was about
as frustrating as pouring out a full beer
to get on Traveller. Yes, the restaurant
could have just ﬁred Bill, but in an ef-
fort to complicate things, I’ll give them
the beneﬁt of the doubt and be grateful
for my restrictions. 1 can only hope that
such inconvenience in my life staves off
at least some unwanted attention, be it
from a possible pedophile or the good
old Lexington Police.

Jersey  

aired last week, and one can ﬁnally see
how manipulative and nasty MTV actu-
ally is. They led us to believe that this
would be the ﬁght of the century, while
in fact the Situation was the one who
knocked his own ass out. In a ﬁt ofrage,
a verbal altercation turned into a head
butt of a concrete wall.

TKO. Kiss the baby.

Aside from this ﬁght, the season
has been fairly plebian. J-Woww, also
known as J-Care Face, has seemed to
turn into a skeleton over night. Vinny is,
and will always be, a snide little trouble-
maker who everyone loves. Pauly D is
the shit and I would buy him a beer any
day of the week, even on the Sabbath.
Deena seems to have grown a particular
appreciation for the ladies, and Snooki
does not matter. Ever.

Tune in to the Jersey Shore Septem-
ber l5th. Trust me, I’m from Jersey.

Forced consumerism challenge in Virginia

John ‘Paul Beall explores constitutional issues surrounding the challenges and protections of the healthcare law

This last
week the 4th
Circuit Court
of Appeals
in Richmond
heard two chal-
lenges to the
Healthcare Act,
sparking con-
troversy. Over
the last year,
several attempts
against the law
have been made
in Federal Cir-
cuit Courts of
Appeals with mixed results. The 6th

l Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati
upheld the disputed law in a 2-1 ruling
in June, and the 11th Circuit Court in At-
lanta ruled against the law, 2-1. The 4th
Circuit Court ruled that a case against
the law could not be made until some-
one had received a penalty for refusing
purchase of health insurance.

COLUMNIST

The court ruled in favor of the law
on grounds that judges are forbidden
by federal law from ruling on tax chal-
lenges until the tax is collected, adding
yet another layer to an issue. already
riddled with layers of Constitutional and
ideological elements. Opponents of the
Court’s ruling expected the federal court

not owning insurance would be based
on taxable income, the ﬁne inflicted on
non-owners is in fact a tax. Furthermore,
Motz states that the law strips all judges
of the right to make a ruling on the mat-
ter until the law is in effect. Judge James
Wynn concurred, stating his belief that
the law was constitutional; Judge Andre

dent that the high court will ultimately
uphold the law and rule that Congress
has broad power to regulate the health

are high for the Obama administration.

Whether or not the penalty is
a tax, the fact still remains that
the core of the issue is not one of taxes,
but one of Constitutional interpretation.
The broad interpretation of the Interstate
Commerce Clause (Article 1, Section 8,
Clause 3) and the Elastic Clause (Article
1, Section 8, Clause l8) has reached a
new frontier under the Healthcare Act.

Proponents of the law claim that Con-
gress has such power over the regulation
of interstate commerce that it can force
every able citizen in the United States
to purchase a good or service in spite of
preference. ’

Frankly, that argument does not
stand well to begin with, since insurance
policies vary state by state and are of-
ten non-transferable across state borders
because of state laws. Those laws are a
restriction of interstate commerce and a
violation of the ﬁill faith and credit that
states are supposed to have for items
from other states. Yet as long as those
laws exist, I question whether insur-
ance markets can truly be considered,
interstate commerce, since current in-
frastructure clearly favors the states in
the issue. Regardless of personal belief,
this controversy is but one more reason
that the 2012 Election (and the upcom-
ing Mock Convention) will be exciting,
interesting and important.

ColumnistAli Greenberg pleads for the women of W&L to end the hate and be the change they wish to see on campus

Partially

year, here is

revised ver-
sion of an

" " ;.' article that

By All reenberg was quoted

COLUMNIST in the New
York Times.

It is my understanding that a school
paper should be a medium to discuss
things that are actually current and im-
portant on campus, so I ﬁgure, why not
take a shot at a serious article. Start the
year off with a bang while at least the
freshmen are still reading the Phi.

From gender relations to inter-Greek
camaraderie to our attitudes about drink-
ing and partying, we have very twisted
perceptions about campus life at Wash-
ington and Lee. And these issues are just
that: self—evident truths that can be hard
to accept and harder to ﬁght or change.

We live in a warped reality. A bubble.
And while I may joke about the differ-
ences between Yankees and debs, the
differences are very real. Similar di-
vides persist between those who come
from private or public schools, white
and multicultural students, and Greeks
and independents.

These divides are generally unspo-
ken. They seem to exist without rules
or formal segregation, yet the social at-
titudes and cultural or background dif-
ferences remain ever apparent.

One of the largest divides I ﬁnd is
the one between those who claim to be
united. Within and between our Greek
organizations there is tension, especially
in the Panhellenic community. And as
much as it hurts me to admit _it, I am of-
ten disappointed by the nature of lunch
and dinner discussions at the sorority
houses.

The former conversations generally
follow a “boys and beer” pattern, while
the latter usually consist of talking about
other girls. And while this obviously
isn’t all we talk about, I have heard and,
admittedly, taken part in many con-
versations of girls judging other girls.
“Do you think she is pretty?,” “She
gets around,” “Why

we need to recognize this and make a
change. Treating each other like lesser
beings by making generalizations and
judgments about groups or individuals
is wrong and should stop. We are better
than that.

In the words of the Reverend Jeremi-
ah Wright, “Different does not mean de-
ﬁcient, it just means different.” We are
neither better nor worse than each other.
Not everything has to be black and white
in the sense of prettier or uglier, fatter
or skinner, smarter or dumber, better or
worse.

When we ﬁnally recognize this, may-
be we can realize that we all have bigger
issues at hand to be dealing with. Like

turn south.

I cannot wrap my head around why
we participate in negative and detri-
mental conversations. Perhaps because
it makes ourselves feel better, because
we ﬁnd it funny or harmless, or maybe
we are simply bored. Whatever the rea-
son, it is clear that we have all forgotten
about the Golden Rule.

So the next time you sit down at srat
dinner, try to talk about politics or sports
or clothing or travel. You can talk about
food, sex, books, class, celebrities, any-
thing. Just don’t talk about each other.
Don’t call someone your best friend and
say you love her to death even though
she is a total bitch.

Because when

are guys into her? I
just don’t see it,” or
“Who is the pretti-
est girl in that pledge
class?”

Rarely are there
complimentary con-
versations about girls
for something other
than being thin or
dressing well. For-
get about being acknowledged for be-
ing smart, a leader on campus or a kind
person.

If another girl dates your ex, you are
automatically “so much cuter than her,”
especially considering that she became a
slut and a bitch overnight.

Ladies, the problem with gender rela-
tions on our campus starts with us. We
treat each other with little to no respect,
and give so little credit to those outside
our inner circle.

We can be mean, mean girls, and

Rarely are there ‘complimentary conversations
about girls for something other than being thin or 1
dressing well. Forget about being acknowledged for
being smart, a leader on campus or a kind person.

President Obama said: “We do not have
time for this kind of silliness. We have
more important things to do.”

We are students, sisters, daughters,
leaders, employees, athletes, presidents,
volunteers and friends. We are all strong
individuals who have something to of-
fer. So why can’t we show that?

There is nothing fundamentally
wrong with sitting around and shooting
the shit every now and then with a little
light gossip. But it is when the conversa-
tions turn into a roast that things take a

you do this, you be-
come the total bitch.
And if I were a guy,
wouldn’t respect
any girl who treated
her “friends” with as
little respect as we do
most days. We blame
everything on the
boys, but we don’t
take accountability
for our own actions and realize that we
are putting forth negative perceptions
about others and ourselves.

We sit there and listen as others lam-
bast our peers. Sometimes we partake.
Sometimes we walk away. But it is
rare that someone ever says, “Let’s talk
about something more positive”.

We cannot put all the blame for gen-
der relations on the high sexual assault
rate or the lack of women on the E.C.
We have the ability to make this school
a better place, a better environment for

women. All it takes is being nicer to one
another, and actually supporting each
other instead of tearing each other down.

Because, to be honest, to an outside
observer, we come off as privileged,
selﬁsh and spoiled; We seem to have
inﬂated egos and elevated opinions of
ourselves, and for what? Because we got
into W&L we are suddenly better than
others? Because we got into a “higher-
ranking” sorority we are cooler or pret-
tier or better?

I am going to let everyone in on a se-
cret. While you may be making friends
for a lifetime, or establishing a network
for later job or social opportunities, what
organization you were in and whether or
not you were “cool” in college, doesn’t
really matter in the real world. It just
doesn’t. No one cares.

What people care about is your char-
acter: your kindness, your honesty, your
consideration and your trust. These are
the traits we are supposed to be building
here as well-rounded students.

We all, myself included, contribute
to this negativity at one time or anoth-
er, which is why I used the royal “we”
throughout this article (or technically
the editorial “we” in this case.) And if
I am able to admit that this behavior is
wrong, we should all be able to take a
step back and seriously reassess our ac-
tions.

So let’s ﬁx this. Let’s stop the silli-
ness and the sassiness. This is a brand-
new year. Let’s make conscious efforts
to be kinder, to be positive, to not make
judgments, to be nice girls. Because at
the end of the day, it is always better to
kill them with kindness.

Textbooks: a thing of the past‘?

Sally Platt explores the beneﬁts of trading in printed books for a lighter, greener and newer option of e-books

By Sally Platt
COLUMNIST

. Last Thursday, as I lugged home an
impossibly heavy bag of books from
the University store, I couldn’t help
wondering—how long until textbooks
go extinct? The University of Phoe-
nix has already done away with paper
textbooks. Instead, professors order the
needed number of “e-books” from a
ﬁrm and distribute them to students at a

much-reduced cost. Often a $250.00
chemistry text can be purchased for as
little as $35.00. At Meridian Intemation-
al College in Taguig City, administra-
tors make it even easier for students by
providing iPads for all, free of cost. At
the University of Texas at San Antonio,
iPads are on hire in the library with the
required reading pre-loaded. Although

It is the mission of THE

this kind of generosity may be a stretch
for even the ﬁnances of our school it led
me to wonder#what would be the ad-
vantage of Washington and Lee going
the e-book route?

First of all, the e-book route is the
paperless route. To be politically cor-
rect, our institution has to adhere to the
popular cries of “save the planet” and
“reduce, re-use, recycle.” While many
see little sense in the notion that drink-
ing coffee from a recycled paper cup
will somehow make up for the mounds
of carbon dioxide released into the at-
mosphere when we drive our cars every
day, it is comforting that we are “saving
the planet” with so
little motion.

and say, “Hey, I managed to make my
books only cost $150.00 this semester.
Does this mean I get to keep the extra
$500.00?!” He might just say yes. It
would be worth a try. The price of text-
books almost tripled between 1986 and
2004, and the last seven years have seen
no reduction. The typical American stu-
dent spends about a $1000.00 21 year on
books. And not all people have the op-
tion of simply “swiping home” this little
problem. For some students, the cost of
books can inhibit them from attending
college at all.

And even if it this is not a problem
for you, think what could be done with

the doors of all of its 399 stores. As digi-
tal books outstrip the traditional, I know
many of us will remember with fondness
(and not a little regret), our childhoods
ﬁlled with the old kind of books, the
“real” books. We might remember cud-
dling up next to our parents for picture
books before bed (remember Goodnight
Moon, Curious George, and Amelia Be-
delia?), or the ﬁrst time we were able to
read a book through on our own (skip-
ping all the big unpronounceable words,
of course). And then of course there was
the long wait and joyful celebration ev-
ery time a new Harry Potter arrived on
the shelves.

Then again, peo-
ple like what they

Being Superman
has never been so
easy. It is hard not
to love the sense of
well-being one gets
from deciding not to
print that PDF but
to read it online, or
choosing to take the
extra time to ﬁgure
out which of the many colorful trashcans
one’s plastic Coke bottle is supposed to
go in (I sometimes do this when I am
depressed—quite the mood-booster.)

I am not sure that our University
administrators get a mood-boost from
enforcing the policy of being environ-
mentally friendly, but it is certainly
taken seriously. D-hall has plastic to-go
containers, the library printers are often
set to print double-sided (much to the
chagrin of someone trying to print a pa-
per), and the lights routinely go off in
my hallway if I take more than the allot-
ted ﬁve seconds to reach my destination.
If our university does all this, shouldn’t
we do away with the great waste of pa-
per traditional textbooks represent? One
tree only makes about 200 books. That
is a lot of sad trees.

A second factor in favor of e-books
is the cost. Maybe I could go to my dad

Maybe I could go to my dad and say, “Hey, 1 man-
aged to make my books only cost $150 this semester.

Does this mean I get to keep the extra $500?! ”

$500.00 in extra change! I could totally
buy that new Coach bag I’ve been day-
dreaming about (Coach Classic Leather
Madison Satchel, in vermillion).

Speaking of bags, the introduction
of e-books would make it essential that
I get that bag. Without heavy pounds
of books to carry, the nature of the on-
campus item holder would be radically
changed. Away with the bulky backpack
and in with the cute carry-all, designed
to be just big enough to carry an iPad
and a few other essentials. In fact, I
could probably use any of the purses I
have in my closet. (But don’t tell my
dad! I really want that bag.)

Finally, e-books are simply the way
of the future. In July of 2010, Amazon
announced that for the ﬁrst time ever in
the past three months, its sale of e-books
was greater than its sale of hard-copy
books. In July of 2011, Borders closed

son can get used to
anything. So when
all of us now in col-
lege ﬁnally have kids
they will probably be
perfectly happy with
their e-readers and
iPads, watching Cu-
rious George jump
across the screen to the Man with the
Yellow Hat instead of the old page-tum
otherwise used to get him there.
Considering all these things on my
walk to my house on Thursday, and
arriving there drenched in sweat from
mental exertion and the weight of my
heavy book-load, was quite the trying
experience. My conclusion is that it is
alright for things to go extinct some-
times. If they are outdated, outmoded or
obsolete, they should go. To hold onto
them is to make oneself obsolete. Now
let’s just hope W&L comes to the same
conclusion soon, so we can hold onto

our new, shiny and bright Forbes #25 V

listing.

“friendly”

eye contact.

NOTE: Know the difference between
“friendly” and “creepy.” Friendly means
fewer than three seconds. Creepy means

more than ﬁve seconds.

3. Introduce yourself. Then pause
to let the other person do the same.

NOTE: You do not need to pay much
attention to the name the person says.
You’ll forget it by the time you cross the
quad back to your room, anyway.

4. Ask a question.

NOTE: Favorites include “What
dorm are you in?,” “Where are you
from?,” and of course, the W&L staple,
“Are you going out tonight?” Small talk
can stem easily from each answer given,
e.g. “Oh, Graham-Lees? That sucks—
no A/C.” Or, invariably, “Graham-Lees?
Awesome!” High ﬁving may ensue.

5. Say goodbye (or any of its

variations).

6. I Rinse and repeat.

NOTE: Of course, next time pick a
different person. Try at least to remem-
ber whether or not you’ve already in-
troduced yourself to someone. This will
save you from plodding through more
inane chatter than necessary.

As a ﬁrst-year, I’m wonderingAAre
any of my other classmates also tired of
having the same conversation again and
again? It’s like experiencing intermina-
ble déja vu. Especially when you have
the same conversation with the same
person you met just last Saturday, but
don’t actually remember.

Of course if you don’t introduce

yourself, then you won’t familiar-
ize yourself with anyone. And if I’ve
learned anything in my ﬁrst week, it’s
that living social is quite the priority at
W&L. The speaking tradition speaks for
itself (wink, wink, nudge, nudge).
Corny jokes aside, I really do feel a
bit washed out of my desire to repeat the
standard dialogue.’ Each of us is play-
ing a tired role, using a tired script, and
ignoring the fact that perhaps meeting
so many people, so quickly is actually
ineffectual. I don’t remember half the
people ‘I’ve met, especially as I haven’t
talked to them since our hasty introduc-
tions. But what can be done? It seems
as if going through the motions is man-

dated by the status of “new student,” or
“ﬁrst-year.”

Either way, I admit my premature so-
cial ennui. I just hope it isn’t so heavy
that it cannot be lifted or shattered by
any single surprise in conversation.
And, of course, I do retain vast stores
of hope for the coming days of the year
when our cordial urges will be satisﬁed
(for the most part). Eventually, we will
be familiar enough with our surround-
ings to do social improv., that is, to be
ourselves.

Stereotyping W&L ﬁrst-years

Former editor Stockton Bullitt lists the types of students he suspects students will recognize in the incoming class

I
thought
that se-
nior year
of college
would be
similar to
senior year
of high
school. All
I would
have to do
is wax po-
etic about
every
meaningless last I ever did, and drench
my prose in nostalgic phrases with
meaningless inside jokes. Throwing in
an extra “Do less” or “Move it, football
head” would be enough to prove that, as
a senior, I am properly keeping an eye
on the past while moving way too fast
towards graduation and the future.

However, senior year hasn’t really
worked out this way so far. Instead, I
ﬁnd myself doing two things I usually
chide others for doing. I talk way too
much about getting old, and I give way
too much patronizing advice to fresh-
men at parties. I hate these two aspects
about myself because 22 is not terribly
old, and my advice in the past has guar-
anteed Louisville over Moorehead State
and Germany winning the World Cup.

So even though I’m right about most
things (e.g. the J-School and everything
I’m writing in this article), please do not
let me get to Yoda levels of patronizing
advice. It gets boring after a while.

With that said, every freshmen class
is unique in its own way, but, c’mon, this
is Washington and Lee, where unique
has been a relative term for over 250
years. So, here are some stereotypes that
will probably be in the freshman class
this year. I’d add more of an introduc-
tion, but I might throw my back out in
my old, decrepit age.

The Tyler the Creator kid

This is the spot reserved for the to-
ken crazy freshmen. Most upperclass-
men, especially sophomores, are eager
to challenge any over-aggressive fresh-
men during the beginning of the year.
Usually all these upperclassmen have to
do is find the blond freshman with gel
in his hair surrounded by all the cute
freshmen girls and challenge his author-
ity in public. You’ve seen this plotline
on “Planet Earth” hundreds of times,
and 99 percent of the time, the freshman
backs down and sulks in the comer.

However, the Tyler the Creator kid is
never even approached by upperclass-
men because he is freaking crazy. There
may be plenty ofolder guys complaining
about his presence, but they will never
do it to his face. The Tyler the Creator
kid does not have to prove that he is
crazy like Arnold did in that episode of
“Hey Arnold.” Rather, It’s something in
his eyes. Guys will not mess with him
no matter what he does to them.

You are probably wondering why he
is named the Tyler the Creator kid. Well,
Tyler the Creator is the epitome of this
persona. He recently won MTV’s Best
New Artist Award, but I have a feeling
you don’t know who he is, and if you
are older than 25, you deﬁnitely do not
want to know who he is. Watch the mu-
sic video for his top single “Yonkers,”
and you will either characterize him as
crazy good or crazy evil; it all depends
on your music tastes.

Whether you like him or not, Tyler
the Creator is on top of his game now.
He is the Kevin Durant of the hip hop
genre. His album “Goblin” was released
right around the time the Thunder made
it to the Western Finals, and his summer
releases have coincided perfectly with
KD’s Rucker Park and other exhibi-

tion masterpieces. Tyler’s R&B buddy,
Frank Ocean, is looking very similar to
Russell Westbrook after being featured
on three songs in Jay-Z and Kanye’s
“Watch the Throne.” And his little cous-
in, Earl Sweatshirt, bears a striking re-
semblance to James Harden. It all ﬁts!

Long-Distance Relationship kid

Enough movies have been made
about this for me not to have to go into
great detail, so instead l’ll give some
patronizing advice. As this kid’s friend,
it’s not your job to keep the relation-
ship going or break it up. Like Miley
Cyrus’ career, the relationship will end,
and it will end quickly. Even President
Ruscio knows about the Turkey Drop.
As the friend, your job is to make sure
that when your friend goes public, his
IPO price is adequately high. Don’t let
him screw up his single life by apply-
ing early decision to his safety school.
You also have to make sure that he isn’t
just applying to Ivies because he thinks
that hot girls will like him just because
he was nice to his high school girlfriend.
Overall, just be careful because these
new commodities are especially volatile
in the market.

Fifteen Pounds Girl

I’m not going to go into much detail
because anywhere I go with this will
get me into trouble, so here’s a quick
description: every freshman class has
one girl who gets the freshman ﬁfteen
and one girl who drops the freshman ﬁf-
teen. Regardless of what happens, there
will be some passive-aggressive con-
versations about it in her friend group.
If she added ﬁfteen pounds, she will
vehemently avoid and dismiss any con-
versation topic about weight. If she lost
ﬁfteen pounds, she will leave hanging
sentences just so you can compliment
her on her looks.

The worst part of these situations is
how much needless worrying and fo-
cus is dedicated to these ﬁfteen pounds.
Your weight is kind of like your pet:
nobody else cares about the intricacies
of maintaining it. No one minds a single
dog story, but everyone hates the person
who never stops talking about his or her
cats. It’s the same way with weight. If
you start saying the word calories more
than ﬁve times a day, people are going to
start hating you, and that’s a fact.

Will Ferrell kid

Just like most Will Ferrell movies, '

you probably don’t like this kid right
now. His jokes aren’t funny, and there
seems to be something a little off about
him. By October, you might be telling
your friends that this kid has all the
signs of a GDI. Look, I had the same
feeling when I ﬁrst saw “Anchorman” or
even “Land of the Lost.” At ﬁrst glance,
none of Will Ferrell’s movies are that
great. But just like “Grandma’s Boy”
and “Family Guy,” Will Ferrell’s mov-
ies get exponentially better with each re-
peat showing. You hear the same dumb
jokes, and suddenly Veronica Mantooth
is funny as hell. It’s the same way with
this kid. It’ll start with his freshman
friends swearing by him. It will prob-
ably take you a while to warm up to
this kid, the same way that it took you
a while to warm up to the idea of Will
Ferrell befriending a T-Rex, but I prom-
ise you it will happen. And by May, you
will swear by this kid and be quoting his
jokes religiously. Know that the next
time you’re glaring maliciously at that
dumbass freshman with his dumbass
grin standing nonchalantly at Windfall.

Judgy friend

No matter what your "interests are or
how many friends you have, there will
be one of these kids for every group of
friends in the freshmen class. This is the
kid that will raise his or her eyebrows
condescendingly when you whip_ out a

_ stupid reasoning, just

handle or decide to go home with some-
one. This is the kid that quietly smirks
when you mention you might be inter-
ested in checking out the Hillel house.
He or she is the friend dedicated to lim-
iting your fun and adventure this year.
Just know two things: 1) these kids get
shit on all four years for being downers
and 2) if you aren’t doing a couple of
new things your freshmen year, whatev-
er they are, then you are deﬁnitely doing
something wrong. Just look at Jay-Z.

Before this summer, when was the
last time you saw Jay-Z smile? No, not
on the “Hard Knock Life” video, that
was a smirk at best. He’s been so suc-
cessful with the corporate, serious busi-
nessman rapper image that he hasn’t had
to exert himself or even play around in
the last decade. But just look at him in
the “Otis” video, and you’ll see a grin-
ning adolescent who never imagined
that a Maybach could look like the Bat-
mobile. His carefree attitude on that
video changed the- entire “Watch the
Throne” album for me. The album was
characterized as a

pate in all that popularity stuff because
she is above all of that. Just notice where
she is during sorority meetings and how
she acts at Windfall after a couple of
drinks. Suddenly the girl who bakes her
own bread and lectures you about what
“real art” means is twirling her hair
looking deep into the eyes of some Phi
Delt. Plus, she’ll tell you that The Girl
with The Dragon Tattoo is a trashy read
that is not worth her time.

And that is NOT the case. The Girl
with the Dragon Tattoo is easily the best

beach read novel of the past decade and I

will own the box oﬁice when the movie
hits theaters during Christmas. l’ve
spent more time defending this series
than I have defending “Entourage” to
non-adolescent males, and that’s saying
something. The Girl with the Dragon
Tattoo series is so far above The Da Vin-
ci Code, it’s a crime to compare them.
The Da Vinci Code is just another reason
why English teachers from Exeter have
needlessly high opinions of themselves
and what they do.

Phase kid

This kid will spend his entire college
career ﬁnding that one thing he wants
to do for the rest of his life. The only
problem is that he will change his mind
every couple of months. The key with
this kid is to make sure he or she has
a genuine interest in the new calling.
See, about half of the phase kids just go
through different phases of interests be-
cause they are searching for something
they feel passionate about. That’s ﬁne.
But the other half make their decisions
based solely on whether other people
think what they’re doing is cool. There’s
no deﬁnitive way to know if your phase
kid friend is a leader or a follower, but
know that if he or she is in the Dub-
step Phase, SEC Football Coach Phase,
ROTC Phase or Drug Phase, you should
be especially vigilant.

By Colleen Moore

Incoming ﬁrst-years gave this year’s
Volunteer Venture the most positive re-
views yet, said Jenny Davidson, Student
Service Learning Coordinator. Ofthe 99
participants, 80 percent said they plan to
volunteer in Lexington and on campus.

The one-week service learning pro-
gram took place in Roanoke, Lexington,
Washington, Greensboro, Charleston
and Richmond, the most recently creat-
ed trip. The program aimed to introduce
ﬁrst-years to each other, to poverty is-
sues and to upperclassmen who can help
them become involved on campus and
in the Rockbridge area.

“The Volunteer Venture trip was
probably the best possible way I could
have picked to start my time at Wash-
ington and Lee,” said one participant.

“It was an incredible experience that al-
lowed me to help others while getting to
know classmates and upperclassmen.”

After choosing between the two pre-
orientation options of Volunteer Venture
and Appalachian Adventure, the future
W&L students picked which service
trip they wanted. Then they arrived one
week before regular move-in day and set
off for their particular city.

Thirty-three student leaders guided
the ﬁrst-years through the week. These
leaders had to undergo an interview pro-

cess and Poverty 101 before leading a'

trip. The Student Service Learning team
aimed for a diverse group with experi-
ence in volunteering and a strong in-
volvement in campus activities.
Leaders’ two-day training included

a talk from Dr. Horton, the director of
health and counseling service, to in-
form them about any medical issues that
might have arisen during the trip. _

Shiri Yadlin, the student coordinator,
played a huge role in the organization of
Volunteer Venture. As a ﬁrst-year, she
went on the D.C. Volunteer Venture trip
with similar goals ofmeeting people and

getting acquainted with W&L.

Having volunteered in high school,
she wanted to get involved on campus
and with the Shepherd Poverty pro-
gram. Her sophomore year, she led the
Lexington trip, which help to introduce
ﬁrst-years to not only W&L but also the
surrounding area.

“It encourages ﬁrst-years to get out-
side campus and get involved in the

nts to bond

community to places where nobody
typically goes,” said Yadlin.

As ajunior, Yadlin worked with Vol-
unteer Venture by creating and coordi-
nating the Richmond trip. As Student

Coordinator her senior year, Yadlin led s

the orientation for the trip leaders and

visited each site. ‘‘I got to see all the ,

trips in action,” she said.

Students interested in volunteering

on campus‘ can attend Nabors Service
Day, which places students at different
agencies where they can continue to vol-
unteer if they choose.

“If you can ﬁnd a place or an activ-
ity that you’re passionate about, it’s not
a burden. You will actively keep going
back to it,” said Yadlin.

F irst-years and trip leaders survive ﬁve days roughin ’it on the Appalachian Trail

By Paige Gance
ARTS & LIFE EDITOR

After ﬁve days ofbackpacking along
the Appalachian Trail, all 108 ﬁrst-years
and 36 trip leaders made it back to cam-
pus safely. This is the largest group ever
to go on the Appalachian Adventure pre-
orientation trip, now in its 16th year.

James Dick, Outing Club director,
said there are typically eight to nine
groups, but this year 12 groups hiked
sections of the trail from Mountain
Lake, Va. to Shenandoah National Park,
covering anywhere from 25 to 35 miles
total.

“We want people to truly meet a
small group of classmates, get to know
them, be themselves, in a non-forced
setting,” said Dick. “its a great way to
enter W&L.”

Fishing and rock climbing used to be
offered as pre-orientation trips, but Dick

said they moved to only backpacking
because the groups seem to form tighter
bonds.

Groups consist of three trip leaders
and nine ﬁrst-years all working together
to cook, set up tarps, start campﬁres and
carry everything the group needs on
their backs.

Trips ranged from moderate to chal-
lenging, based on total miles and eleva-
tion changes. Some trips had abundant
water sources, but others needed to car-
ry multiple 10-liter water bags to hold
them over until the next potential water
source.

Many participants were able to expe-
rience some of Virginia’s natural won-
ders for the ﬁrst time, like Devil’s Mar-
bleyard, Tinker Cliffs, McAfee’s Knob
and Dragon’s Tooth. The Outing Club

also organizes day trips to hiking desti-
nations like these during the school year.

The weather for the trips was gener-
ally in the campers’ favor, with only one
afternoon thunderstorm causing trouble
for a group caught on a high ridge.

An’ ongoing criminal investigation
also caused a fright for a few groups
camped near the James River, with one
group choosing to get picked up the
night before their scheduled departure.
Several forest rangers and law enforce-
ment ofﬁcers were in the area and spoke
to at least two groups.

They said their investigation con-
cemed the body of a hiker found a few
weeks prior on the trail, but assured one
group that they were “as safe as any-
where else on the trail.”

Beside the group that evacuated,

only one other person was picked up
early due to a cut that made carrying a
backpack painful.

“Overall though, it went well,” said
head sherpa Zach Zoller. He said the
work he and fellow head sherpa Ali
Pedersen put into the trips was akin to a
part-time summerjob.

Six sherpas coordinated the behind
the scenes aspect ofthe trips, like plan-
ning new routes, ordering hundreds of '
pounds of food, and communicating
with the incoming students via e-mail
over the summer.

Next year, Zoller said there may be
as many as four head sherpas as Appala-
chian Adventure gains more trip leaders
and participants.

Those interested in leading a trip

. next year need to take PE 180: Wilder-

ness Leadership in the winter. Leaders
also receive additional’ training in the
week before the trip, which includes
Wilderness First Aid certiﬁcation.

Next year, James said leaders will re-
ceive the advanced wilderness certiﬁca-
tion. Training will once again take place
at Camp Blue Ridge. Leaders went there
for the ﬁrst time this year because the
university had sold Skylark Farm, the
former training spot.

Senior Tal Jacobs, who has now lead
three trips and participated as a ﬁrst-
year, said leading pre-orientation trips
has been “one of the deﬁning elements
of my W&L career, and helped me ﬁnd
a group ofcool, interesting people in the
Outing Club.”

ootball starts season 2-0

After last year’s record-setting season, the
Washington and Lee football is off to a hot
start with an undefeated 2-0 record, boosted
by a comfortable 31-14 win over Sewanee in
Lexington on Saturday.

The win marked the Generals seventh
straight win over the Tigers and their ninth
straight regular season victory, a streak that
extends into last season.

W&L’s offense overcame its struggles
from the week before as senior quarterback
Charlie Westfal threw for two touchdowns
and ran for another to help the team roll up
414 yards, compared to the previous weeks
228 yards.

The Generals scored ﬁrst whenjunior run-
ning back Sasha Vandalov took a 16-yard run
into the endzone, topping off a 10-play drive
that covered 73 yards.

The lead grew with a 27-yard touchdown
pass ﬁ‘om Westfal to senior wide receiver
Cody Smith on a gutsy 4th and 8 play with
just over four minutes left before the half,
putting W&L up by 14.

Senior placekicker Peter Alston added that

lead with a 35-yard ﬁeld goal, and a dominant"

defense kept the Tigers scoreless for the ﬁrst
half, giving the Generals a comfortable 17-0
advantage at the break.

Sewanee came out strong in the third quar-
ter, ﬁnding the end on its ﬁrst possession less
than ﬁve minutes into the second half. A fake
punt on 4th and 1 1 extended the Tigers’ drive
and helped them get on the board.

W&L responded with back-to-back scores,
the ﬁrst a 14-yard run by Westfal and the sec-
ond a 16-yard pass from Westfal to sophomore

end Alex Evans, to go Lip 31-7 with just over
seven minutes of playing time remaining.

The Tigers came up with a late score in
the ﬁnal minute to help close the margin of
victory.

The Generals’ defense held Sewanee to
only 256 yards for the day. Senior defensive
back Jake Pelton led the team with 11 tack-
les, nine of which were solo, and recovered a
fumble, whilejunior linebacker Stephen Peck
recorded a sack and seven tackles.

A week earlier, W&L started the season
with a 24-10 win over Franklin & Marshall
a week earlier, snapping a three-game losing
streak to the Diplomats.

A dominantdefense made up for early of-
fensive struggles as the team forced ﬁve tum-
overs and came up with ﬁve sacks while hold-
ing F&M to only 14 rushing yards, though the
Generals were outgained on the day 316 to
228. ‘

After a scoreless ﬁrst quarter, W&L found
the end zone ﬁrst 44 seconds into the second
quarter when Westfal connected with Evans
for a 10-yard touchdown pass to go up by
seven.

 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  

The Diplomats responded with a 25-yard
ﬁeld goal on their ensuing drive and threat-
ened to score again on their next drive as they
got to the W&L 11-yard line. Senior line-
backer Rob Look was able to preserve the
Generals’ lead by intercepting a pass on the
9-yardline.

On their third drive, F&M again got within
scoring distance ofthe end zone but missed a
31-yard ﬁeld goal as the clock ran out ‘at the
end of the half, allowing the Generals to go
into the break with a 7-3 lead.

W&L put three more points on the board
with a ﬁeld goal at the end ofthe third quarter,
and then added a touchdown by junior run-
ning back Brett Murray to go up 17-3 with
10:29 left to play.

Three minutes later, the Diplomats added
a touchdown of their own, but the Generals
put away threats of an upset by scoring once
again, this time a six-yard run by Westfal, to
secure the win with less than four minutes left
to play.

The team will head to Centre College on
Saturday for a 7:30 p.m. contest, but will be
back in Lexington the week after to take on
Alma.

Volleyball kicking ace

The Generals are 0/?" to a 8-0 Start and have dropped only two of their 26 sets

By Angela Williams
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee volleyball team
is off to an undefeated start highlighted by
winning their own tournament last weekend
for the third time in four years.

The Generals breezed through the W&L
tournament, dropping only one set out of
their four games.

in the opening match Friday afternoon,
W&L overcame Averett University to win
3-0. Averett challenged in the ﬁrst set before
falling 26-24. The Generals took off in the
next two sets, posting wins of25-16 and 25-
1 1.

Sophomore hitters Allison Rouse and
M.A. Boles dominated the nets, recording 11
and seven kills, respectively. Rouse also add-
ed seven digs while Boles served three aces.

W&L took on Elizabethtown College later
the same day with similar results.

Boles lead the team with 15 kills in the 3-0

sweep, taking down the Blue Jays with scores

of 25-16, 25-16 and 25-11. Senior blocker
Lindsey Dee managed eight kills out of only
10 swings.

Junior libero Cameron Hill came up with
14 digs, which gave her 1,127 career digs and
moved her into sixth place all-time at W&L.
Hill also recorded 15 digs against Averett.

In addition to their killing and digging tal-
ents, the Generals aced 16 serves. Sophomore
setter Meghan Meleski, ﬁrst-year defensive
specialist Kelly McManus and senior defen-
sive specialist Megan Toinlinson each con-
tributed four aces.

Day two staited against Southern Vir-
ginia University and led to the Generals’ one
dropped set. After easily taking the ﬁrst set
25-16, W&L slipped in the second to lose 17-
25. The team quickly recovered to ﬁnish the
game with 25-12 and 25-13 victories.

Meleski set a personal career-liigh with 50

assists, while Boles again led the team with

19 kills. She was far from the only offensive
power, as Dee contributed 1 1 kills andjunior
hitter Taylor Maxey added nine more.

For the ﬁnal match of the tournament,
W&L took down Gettysburg 3-0, winning
the sets 25-18, 25-18, 25-21 to take home its
eighth championship in this tournament.

Boles was dominate again, notching 20
kills and nine digs, and Rouse put in a strong
game both offensively and defensively, re-
cording 13 kills and six digs.

W&L’s eight straight wins mark their best
start to a season since 2008.

The team has talent and contributors at
every position, suggesting that the season’s
early success is just a taste of what the Gener-
als can accomplish.

The Generals will travel to Guilford on
Tuesday, but will be back on the courts in
Lexington on Friday to take on Hollins at 5
p.m.

over the years, met with varying levels of enthusiasm. Some on campus are tired of reading stories full of
terrifying anonymous accountsof sexual assault and endless statistics. This Phi story isn’t like ‘the others.

of Normal, Ill. last month to attend.a
two-day training seminar that focused
on different aspects of
handling sex crime in-
vestigations. 4

The three ofﬁcers-—
Larry Stuart, Lisa Datz
and Kay Bostick—at-
tended two eight-hour
sessions in which they
learned how to better
help victims go through
the process of reporting
a sexual assault.

Members of Campus
Safety and the Student
Affairs Office specu-
late different reasons as
to why sexual assault
seems to be underreport-
ed on campus. Whatev-
er the reason, Sidney Ev-
ans, the dean of student

life, decided it was time for the school
to be more proactive in addressing sexu-
al assault crimes on campus.

“Knowing the [Student Faculty
Hearing Board] procedures had been ad-
dressed, we sort of felt like it was time
to make sure we were looking at our
educational efforts but that we were also
looking at how people get into the sys-
tem,” said Evans. “Because no matter
how good your procedures are, if people
aren’t reporting [crimes], your proce-
dures are never even going to come into
play.”

Mike Young, director ofpublic safety
at W&L, said he hopes that providing
easy access to these specially trained of-
ﬁcers will encourage more people who
have been sexually assaulted to come
forward. '

Young said he hopes to have at least
one of the trained ofﬁcers working dur-
ing every shift throughout the day. The

officers will be doing their jobs just as
before, but they now have another tool
in their arsenal that they can use to help
students should it become necessary.

While Youngsaid he believes that
those who commit acts of sexual vio-
lence “need to be in jail,” he encour-
ages people to report a crime through
the school if they are more comfortable
with that.

“For nine months this is your home
and we want you to be comfortable
here,” said Larry Stuart, one of the
trained officers and a 28-year veteran of
W&L Public Safety. '

W&L is not the only organization
pursuing new and innovative ways to
combat sexual assault. In July, Vice
President Joe Biden, Health and Human
Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius
and the White House Ofﬁce of Science
and Technology Policy announced a
new “Apps Against Abuse Technology

‘Logistics, cost and storage issues force e-cafe to eliminate meat options from its menu

By Leigh Dannhauser
5 TA F F w R IT E R

Returning students may have been
surprised over the past two weeks when
they headed to the Hillel House excited
for their favorite bagel, only to realize
that it’s no longer on the menu.

Hillel House’s new menu, imple-
mented on Sept. 5, is now dairy-kosher
instead of the kosher menu that they
-have used in the past. Translation: no
more meat.

With the removal of meat comes the
removal of some of people’s favorite
Hillel House meals.

Eight items, including the Reuben-
stein, the twisted chicken salad, and the
hot dogs, are no longer available in the
cafe.

‘‘I’m mad because I liked the Shenan-
doah Turkey. It was a good source of pro-
tein” said sophomore Meredith Lavin.

“The only other option is ﬁsh, which I
don’t like.”

Many in the W&L community have
yet to hear about the changes. Sage Um
is one ofthese people.

“No meat, at all? What?” Um said.

Samantha «Rosier, an officer of Hillel,
knew about the changes early but is still
not pleased.

“I am very upset but I understand it.
We weren’t making money,” Rosier said.

Amenie Mitchell, the head of the e-
cafe’, said that there were two main rea-
sons for the menu change.

“One, the logistics, time and effort
involved with maintaining our kosher
status by keeping meat, pareve, and dairy
separate ' was unsustainable” Mitchell
said. V

“The second reason for changing the

menu was the cost and storage issues
involved with sourcing certiﬁed kosher
meat,” added Mitchell.

Meat and dairy have to be stored in
separate places, and workers cannot -.
work with both items at the same time. 
Also, kosher meat is not readily avail- I
able nearby. To reduce the cost of ship-
ping, meat must be ordered in bulk but
there is not enough storage space readily
available.

Although meat is no longer available,
there are vegan, gluten, and dairy free
options. Ten new sandwiches and four
new salads have been added to the menu.

And students can still ﬁnd some of
their favorites elsewhere. Hot dogs, for-
merly provided in the e—café, are now
available in the co-op.

By Campbell Burr Old; lmsband’
OPINIONS EDITOR D°l‘g> Calls

God her “plas-
tic surgeon;” virgin...until her recent
wedding. Ladies and Gentlemen, meet
Courtney Stodden.

If you have not seen her in the news,
and by news I mean E! TV or a cheap
tabloid, you are missing out. Courtney
Stodden, a 17-year-old recently made
famous by her marriage to former Lost
star, 51-year-old Doug Hutchison, is
Ho1lywood’s newest wannabe-“It Girl.”
Key word: wannabe. It appears that
Courtney will do whatever it takes to be
famous, includingdying her dogs hair
pink, pretending that she never thought
that her marriage to a man 4 years older
than her father would capture public at-

tention, and pretending to be a devout
Christian while simultaneously acting
like a...(thinking of a nice way to put
this—oh well)...slut. Courtney is will-
ing to bare and share every inch of her
body and detail of her relationship to the
public. She began her quest for fame by
advertising herself as a devout Chris-
tian. Look how far she’s come.

The way a woman uses 140 charac-
ters to communicate with the world tells
a lot about her, especially when she is
aware that 28,668 people are following
her. Anyone who thinks that Courtney
Stodden has an ounce of self-respect
should check _her twitter (@Court-
neyStodden) and reconsider. She misus-
es words (i.e. “the sultriness of the day
gently begins to heighten”), uses terms
she thinks are sexual in ways that don’t
make sense (i.e. “a lush creamy ﬁlling”)
and attempts to use alliteration (i.e. “en-
twining my body playfully in white wil-
lowy sheets as I wildly wallow on top of
the wondrous bed”), but fails miserably.
She alternates between tweeting passag-
es from the Bible and tweeting details
about her sex life. It’s confusing, to say
the least. '

Please explain how the same person
who tweeted this on August 2nd 

“It is the blessing of the LORD that
makes rich, And He adds no sorrow to
it. ” Proverbs l0.'22*

could tweet this on August 28th. ..

While 1 lie beneath this sizzling-sun,
the popsicle that I am sweetly sucking
on begins to melt & drips irresistibly all
over my moist body!

Or this on September 16th. ..

to have saved sex for her husband, but
she shares half-naked pictures with the
whole world. This poor, misguided girl
needs parents, but now that she is mar-
ried, maybe their job is done. Is Doug
the new enforcer‘? I wonder if Courtney
still has a strict “bedtime?” Hmmm.
Watch any of Courtney’s interviews
and you’ll be wondering if her vocabu-
lary is big enough for her to understand
the interview questions. When asked
how she knew that Doug was the “one

Another way that Courtney tries
to play good girl is by advertising that
she saved herself for marriage. Good
for Courtney for waiting, but give me a
break, she wed at age 16. She probably
learned about the birds and the bees yes-

then began describing his physical at-
tributes. “Because of his face, of his
body, of his sexy hair. I mean, talk about
seducing, he seduced me! Immediately.
And I knew off the bat that he was the
one for me and that was it. You know,
and when you ﬁnd that one man that

you know you love and you know you
love everything about him—his face, his
body, his hair—go for itl” Wow, Court-
ney, thank you for the modem-day deﬁ-
nition oftrue love!

Apart from offering a dependable
form of entertainment for the work-
place, Courtney’s service to the com-
munity is her anti-bullying campaign.

, Please look up her hit single, “Don’t Put

It On Me,” and her informational video,
“Cyber Bullies and Cyber Victims,” so
you can appreciate all she is doing for
middle school girls: making them feel
flat-chested and pale.

Since Courtney’s singing and speak-
ing abilities do not seem promising, it’s
safe to say that she has already had her
ﬁfteen minutes. It’s time to turn our at-
tention to real women with beauty and
brains, like Meg Whitman, Laura Ingra-
ham, and Oprah Winfrey. Of course by
writing this article, I’ve only succeeded
in giving Courtney what she wants: a
few more Twitter followers and some
more YouTube views.

And while I am still on that tangent,
what is going on with the fourth Spider-
man movie? Am I the only one who
watched the ﬁrst one? You can’t just
completely change the beginning of the
story a decade and two sequels later.

But apart from the minutiae and
inaccuracies, I came to love the super-
hero universe. It started with X-Men,
but grew to include “Spider-man,” Iron
Man, and eventually The Watchmen.
And yes, I read the graphic novel ﬁrst

Fashion Without passion

thank you very much.

Soon the midnight premieres became
routine as more and more superhero
movies came out to satiate the hunger
and craze that has developed for the
genre in recent years. At least I know
it’s notjust me.

But what is it about this universe that
appeals to us? I think there are a few ex-P‘
planations with the simplest being that
it is entertaining, colorful and full of ac-
tion; exactly what sum1ner_ blockbusters
and easy reads are supposed to be.

But, there might be something else
there. Something more sentimental.
Something less shallow than pure enter-
tainment.

Comic books, like any other book of
fiction, are escapes and I think our gen-
eration needs an escape. Beyond ‘Jersey
Shore’ and ‘Gossip Girl’, we seem to
need something to believe in. As silly
or farfetched as it sounds- comics and
superheroes provide hope, and also pro-
vide some pretty gripping social com-
mentary if you just know where to look.

We grew up in an age of uncertainty:
one of high alerts and school shootings
and wiretaps. We were in 3rd through
6th grade when the planes hit, and I feel
like I have never really known a world
that didn’t'need a superhero or two; a
Spider-man to clean up the streets of

New York, an Ironman working on Mid-
dle East relations, or Professor Xavier
mediating world conﬂicts and promot-
ing acceptance.

We love superheroes because they
are fun and kill bad guys. What more
could we ask for in a movie. But I also
think we love them because we need
them, the idea and hope that they repre-
sent. There is realness in their flaws that
lends credibility to our hopes that good
does, or could, exist and prevail.

Maybe I am stretching it, but for me,
comics are that much needed escape.
One that leads to a world of endless pos-
sibiIities- where people climb walls and
read minds and their bipolar disorder
leads to the ability to conjure up energy
ﬁelds and destroy lakes.

The X-Men stand for tolerance, ac-
ceptance of oneself and of others. Bat-
man watches over Gotham. The Green

Lantern ﬁghts evil in brightest day and’

blackest night.

We could dissect every series or
movie to ﬁnd societal references or de-
bate the merits of DC vs. Marvel for-
ever. But atthe end ofthe day, we don’t
have to ﬁnd hidden meanings. Maybe
deep down Superheroes give us hope,

but if not at least Tony Stark has some

great one-liners.

Do W&L students lack individuality when it comes to clothing choice?

September
8th, 2011; most
people would
regard this day
as the start of
the school year,
I was more con-

’ cemed with the
start of the new
fashion calen-
dar.

For the
third year in a
row, Fashion s Night Out took over the
shops and streets of New York City and
kicked off Fashion Week, while I sat in
my room, reading 40 pages in my new
textbook. FNO is a global initiative to
help boost the shopping economy by
bringing together fashionistas all over
the world in support of full price retail:
essentially, it’s the event to be at if you
are like myself, and refer to the Vogue
on your nightstand as the Bible.

So while I was hitting the books
and putting my tuition money to work,
all I could think about was how much I

_ would rather be in NYC (ignore the fact

that I have no connections to even get
me into the tents). I spent the summer
interning in the city, and leaving behind
that wondrous place for rural Lexington
' was difﬁcult, to say the least.

As I ﬁnd myself back on this campus

of less than 2,000 students, I cannot help

I but realize the lack of personal style. I
emphasize the word “personal” because
the people here deﬁnitely have style, but
it generally falls under the category of
Lilly Pulitzer, Jack Rogers, and Ralph

Lauren. One look into Lee Chapel dur-
ing O-Week and you can see that the
kids here know how to “dress to im-
press,” but not dress to stand out.

There is nothing wrong with the clas-
sic preppy look that many a man and
women sport on campus, but there is
something I crave to see in one’s style,
and that is the individuality ofit. It’s all

ment.

Although I often feel overwhelmed
by the amount of polos and khakis I see
around me, every now and then I get a
taste of what I miss most about New
York. It’s a rock n’ roll tee tucked into
a leather mini, or a ﬂoral dress paired
with neon orange combat boots, and I
am reminded that some students here do

One look into Lee Chapel during 0- Week and you

can see that the kids here know how to “dress to

impress, ” but not dress to stand out.
 

too easy to ﬂip through Elle and ﬁnd an
outﬁt that is fashionable, but true style
comes from taking that outﬁt and mor-
phing it into something of your own.

-Walking to class is like walking through

a J. Crew catalogue that Jenna’ Lyons
never had time to style.

Yes, Lexington has about one-mil-
lionth the number of residents that NYC
does, but it is not just the numbers that
limit the person style I see here. It also
lies in the fact that we live in a rural
southern town that does not exactly leap
to accept diversity. Since I do not see
this quality of Lexington changing in the
near future, in the meantime, I quench
my fashion thirst online by spending
countless hours clicking through Spring
2012 slides.

Fortunately, we are not completely
hopeless in the personal style depart-

express themselves through fashion.

Not everyone may feel comfortable
ﬂaunting an avant-garde style, but for
the most part, the students on campus
dress impeccably. The colonnade will
not look like the Chanel runway this fall,
but it would be an understatement to say
that as a student body, we will look any-
thing less than really damn good as we
walk down it.

How to raise that participation grade

Stockton Bullitts words of advice... or, at least,

You
have
probably
noticed
by now
that there
are two
certain-
ties about
going to
Washing-
ton and
Lee. The
first is that
if you are drinking on private property at
a Friday or Saturday night party, LexPo
will pull you into the street and charge
you for an alcohol offense related to
drinking in public. The other is that you
will have a participation grade in every
class you take this term.

I’ll get to this year’s problem with
the werewolves of Lexington in another
issue. But, let’s be honest, only a class
action lawsuit will do anything to cur-
tail the needless arrests, so I’ll focus on
something that you can affect, participa-
tion. Whether you are taking a biology,
music or economics class, somewhere
between ﬁve and twenty percent of your
grade is based on how much you add to
class discussions. When you were ap-
plying to this school, you were probably
tricked into liking this aspect of liberal
arts schools. It puts less pressure on your
exams, and how hard is raising your
hand once or twice a class anyway?

Well, it’s tougher than you think. You
may be all smiles now. The reading may
actually seem interesting and class dis-
cussion may seem vaguely interesting.
However, once the class honeymoon pe-
riod is over, that participation grade will

be a much bigger burden. There will be '

days when you have the ﬂu, didn’t do
the reading last night because you sim-
ply had to watch the “Pretty Little Li-
ars” ﬁnale, or are simply too hung over.

These are the days when you glance at
the clock and tell yourself that there are
only 2460 seconds left of class time.
This is when you will curse the day
Robert E. Lee invented the participation
grade. But, if you simply remember this
article, your participation grade will be
the only thing you’re not worried about
come mid-December.

The key to the participation grade
is developing a strategy. Let’s be hon-
est, simply doing the work on time and
being interested in the subject isn’t go-
ing to happen. You are going to need to
get the grade without being the perfect
student, and to do that, you need to ﬁll
a certain role in the classroom. This is
important because when the professor
goes to the grade book at the end of the
year to divvy up par-

some steps for every student when it comes to class-time discussion

the real world, but in college you can
never go wrong with other people think-
ing that you are incredibly inept but,
gosh darn it, do you work hard. Whether
on the playing ﬁelds, picking up girls, or
in the classroom, I have found the most
success when people are certain that I’m
a well-meaning dumbass. This deﬁnitely
works with professors, who like parents,
want to believe in their ability to captain
your ferry from childhood to adulthood.
So you should do your best to help them
believe that they are changing you pro-
foundly over the course of the semester.
Start out with a couple of idiotic com-
ments in the beginning of the year. You
know the ones where the professor has
to struggle to bring what you said into
the narrative of the lecture. You’ll know

for the entire semester because he or she
wants to take credit for your progress.
Sure, the students who see right through

/your‘ shameless ploy will probably hate
you for manipulating the education sys-
tem so badly, but you’ll have an A, so
screw them.

If you have more of a conscience
but still don’t want to actually do all the
work every day, there are other methods
to getting your participation grade up.
You can be the Annoying Commenta-
tor. If you are already knowledgeable
in a subject, then you are perfect for
this position. Whenever anyone makes
a comment that you remotely disagree
with, simply correct him and pon-
tiﬁcate on your point of view. Raising
your hand or waiting your turn to talk

is for the plebeians

ticipation points, he
or she needs to see
your name and think,
“Oh, that’s the
student.” Even if it
conjures up a nega-
tive image in the pro-
fessor’s mind, as long
as the professor can
think of you as doing
something in class,
you will get a good participation grade.
So, here are the different ways you can
become that student in class.

Disclaimer: if .you are a professor,
this has no basis in reality, and you
should probably skip over to the sports
section. By reading ﬁction in a newspa-
per, you are doing your part to under-
mine the true beneﬁt that newspapers
add to society. And by undermining
newspapers, you are basically support-
ing the terrorists because terrorists don’t
like newspapers, especially Dutch ones.
So, professors, just do your part and stop
here.

My favorite method is the ,Gee Whiz
student. I don’t know how things are in

Even if it conjures up a negative image in the pro-
fessor ’s mind, as long as the professor can think of
you as doing something in class, you will get a good
participation grade. I

you are doing well when the professor
nods a little too vigorously when you are
putting forward a comment, and you’ll
know you are golden when the profes-
sor gives you the “Jenny talking to For-
rest Gump” smile whenever you say
something particularly dumb. Your next
step is the improvement phase. Starting
around Oct. 10 or so, you should start
making the “quoting text and saying
‘I think I know what this means, but
I’m not positive’” kind of comments.
Finally, around November start actu-
ally trying in class and contributing
real thoughts. When this happens, the
professor will be more impressed than
if you had simply said smart comments

who have to take
this class to actually
learn something. All
you need to do is call
out whenever you
feel like it and share
your omniscience
with the rest of the
class. Sure, profes-
sors will hate you,
but there’s no way
they can dock points from your partici-
pation grade because you are constantly
talking.

If you still like to pontiﬁcate but you
aren’t conﬁdent enough in the subject
material to do so every ﬁve minutes,
then you should be the Speech Maker.
All you need to do is know about ﬁve
percent of the material and have an
opinion on it for every class. This is
perfect for you if homework is a bore.
Just do ten minutes of reading and think
about it, then when the material comes
up in class, all you need to do is take the
reins and lecture the class for a solid ﬁve
minutes. After ﬁve solid minutes of talk-
ing, you won’t need to raise your hand

one more time for the rest of class. The
only challenge is to make sure that no-
body else beats you to the punch when
your subject is brought up.

If sharing original thoughts is too
much for you then you should deﬁnitely
be the Repeater. For some reason pro-
fessors have never caught onto this in-
furiating, yet effective trend. When an-
other student answers a question, all you
need to do is raise your hand and say the
exact same thing but in different words.
The key to never getting noticed is you
need to put emphasis on your state-
ment like you just discovered penicillin.
For example, if someone else answers
“Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean
blue in 1492,” you need to raise your
hand and say, “You know, if you really
think about it, a little before 1500, this
guy, Christopher Columbus, well, he
sailed across the ocean. An entire ocean.
Wow.” Cheap and manipulative? Yes.
But, also wonderfully effective.

Lastly, if you are too shy to talk in
class, you have two ways to get over
being the token Quiet Student. Either
harass the professor with questions af-
ter class and during office hours or send
paragraph long emails to the professor
trying so you can “understand the mate-

.rial a little better.” As long as the con-

tact is regular and you appear to sound
interested in the material, you are free
to zone out and think about what’s for
lunch during the entire class.

There are other methods to getting
that participation grade up, but those are
the big ones. Yes, it takes a little. more
effort than doing absolutely nothing,
but, trust me, ‘it’s much easier than actu-
ally being a quality student all the time.
Just remember, if these methods don’t
work out, kissing some good ole ass
never hurt anyone.

The homework for PE 3 01 may beat getting drunk at the cabins, or so columnist Sally Platt believes

By Sally Platt
C o L U M N l s T V

This past Wednesday as my fellow
W&L party lovers were out having a
good time I was stuck in’ my house on
the couch. As I imagined them listening
to frat-tastic music with cups of Natty
Light in their hands (Natty Light? Since
when has anyone missed that? Only the
truly party-desperate), I was having a
bit of a pity party. Could this homework
take any longer? I mean seriously, I’ve
been watching ESPN for hours and I
still don’t know why A-Rod and Cam-
eron Diaz broke up. Did ‘I say watch-
ing ESPN? Oh yeah, that’s right, that’s
my homework. Somehow I, the most
un-spoitsknowledgeable person in the
world, ended up in PE 301, Philoso-
phy and Techniques of Coaching. Also
known as the-coolest-class-at-W&L.
Our homework consists of watching
ESPN and keeping up with football and
other major sports. Frat lords, be jeal-
ous. Oh, except for the insanely hard
tests every Tuesday.

I had just failed the ﬁrst test (30%).
It was still Wednesday, so if I wanted I
could drop the class, go out to the cab-
ins, and have a fantastic night. But I
knew that was not a possibility. For one
thing, I wanted to push this whole lib-
eral arts idea to its limits and see where
it could take me. Isn’t the point of liberal
arts to learn at least a bit from disciplines
across the board? And isn’t sports as far

.that I had subjected

from history, my major, as possible? Ac- -

tually, that is just the reason I told my-
self because I thought it sounded cool.
The real reason I was in the class was
because I had made a mistake at regis-
tration. I assumed any PE class could

I be used to fulﬁll the

just get arrested for? What sport would
you associate the term “Phillies” with?
Ok, that wasn’t one, but I still didn’t
know the answer. I didn’t know the an-
swer to any of these. Panic. But luck-
ily this was just a practice test. l..did,

time I came back to take ‘the ﬁrst Tues-
day test.

This proved harder than I expected.
As I sat and watched my ﬁrst football
game since, I think, that one Superbowl
that the Eagles were in, I kept on get-
ting distracted. Tom

required four classes
needed to graduate.
Never again was I go-
ing to take the 8 AM
weight training (with
the football coach!)
myself to last fall .16‘
term. Oh how cute, I
thought as I looked at
the list of options, a
coaching class. I bet all we do is have a
little talk about who our favorite coach-
es are and then go mess around in the
gym for awhile (kind of like how all you
do in Self-Defense is learn a few moves
and then congratulate yourself on never
having gotten raped). Easy stuff. (Only
later did I learn it did not actually count
as a PE and would, all two credits of it,
end up in my GPA.)

I walked into the class on the ﬁrst
Friday and --- wow, these are all guys.
Oh wait, one other girl. Whew. Still, this
was different than I expected. We began
with a practice test. Who is in the NFL
top rankings? What did Manny Ramirez

I was so busy learning why linebackers have to be
fat that I forgot to memorize the exact expletives

Serena uttered on her rampage against the evil line-

however, know the answer to the next
question the professor (oops, “coach”)
asked. We were discussing “Coaching
Philosophy.” “So what, class, does the
word philosophy actually mean?” My
hand shot up in the air in true Hermione
Granger style. “It means: love of leam-
ing.” A typical test-book answer, right?

The coach looked at me quizzically’

with a “wow, this one’s a real retard”
look on his face and quickly moved on

’ to Mr. Football Dude beside me who,

of course, knew the right answer. Cha-
grined and embarrassed I walked away
from the class detennined to do better. I
would learn all this “sports stuff’ by the

Brady just looks
so good with long
hair. He kind of re-
minds me of a “lax
bro.” Actually, he
kind of reminds me
of a Phi Kap. Oh
wait, I mean “re-
. minded.” (Too soon,

too soon, I know.)

Anyhow, after I had
to ask my RA how many points a “ﬁeld
goal” counted for, I realized just how
much work was ahead of me. (Then,
of course, the Spanish TA walked in
and after staring at the screen for a few
minutes, asked me what the biggest
football game ever was. I told her about
the Superbowl. When she then politely
inquired whether I thought the Generals
would be in it this year, I knew I was in
good company.)

So, despite my best efforts to learn the
rules of football, basketball, NASCAR,
baseball, and tennis in one weekend (oh
and why, by the way, do they have so
many scores in tennis? Couldn’t they

just condense it all into one?) I failed
my ﬁrst test. I was so busy learning why
linebackers have to be fat that I forgot
to memorize the exact expletives Ser-
ena uttered on her rampage against the
evil line-judge. Or, for the matter, what
quality of, um, product Michael Phelps
so famously imbibed in a few years ago.
(Pineapple express I bet, those athletes
really got the dough.)

There was no dropping this class. I
won’t feel like a true American until I
know, at least, who won the last Super
Bowl. Plus, now I have something to
prove to all those guys (did I mention
I tied for the worst grade in the class?
And that the grades are posted for every-
one to see?). And, of course, there is the
fact that PE 301 is, after all, the coolest-
class-at—W&L. I highly suggest you take
it next term. (This is supposed to be the
thesis of this article in case you haven’t
noticed.) There will always be more
Wednesdays. And there will always be
the cabins (especially if they keep on
building more of them). And there will
deﬁnitely always be more Natty Light.
But there will not always be a game be-
tween the Colts and the Browns, so now
it’s time to go watch ESPN.

After observing countless YouTube

Boys — have you ever wondered
what girls actually talk about behind
closed doors? Although it may seem
ridiculous, this depiction by the sketch

frighteningly realistic representation of

“girl talk.” When girls at W&L retire
for the day back to the comfort of the so-
rority house, dorm, apartment, etc., they
often do some of the following:

I) Overanalyze situations, such
as running into someone in the daylight
who you have only ever seen when the
sun is down. “Oh my God, they totes
saw me comingout of co-op so I obvi
ran the other way.” ‘

2) Obsessing over meaningless
texts (or lack thereof). “Should I text
him? Should I wait? What time should
I text him? What do you think this text
means? Do I seem too needy?”

3) Getting overly invested into
the emotional world of reality televi-
sion. While watching who shed the
most pounds on “The Biggest Loser” or
which “Real Housewife” (from Beverly

4) Talking obsessively about
food. Whether we are looking up the
sorority menu for the day (OMG, which
house has taco bar today?!?!) or saying
that our new lifestyle starts tomorrow
when we buy our ﬁrst fruit cup from the
co-op (“our diet starts tomorrow”), we
usually ﬁnd ourselves returning to our
old habits of Buﬁalo Bites, Sunrises,
and Pink Hut (our version of Pinkberry).
To make ourselves feel better, we return
to our old friend (see Number 3) “The
Biggest Loser.”

5) One of the most important as-
pects of being a girl is having a “good

when we say everything, we mean ev-

We are not saying all girls are one
hundred percent like this. We know that
they (ourselves included) are not. Ob-
viously, this school is ﬁlled with intel-
ligent, bright, responsible women whose
minds have much more to worry about
than Bravo Television and boys, and
who are going to go on to accomplish
much bigger things than analyzing text
messages. However, one must admit
that this is an occasional part of every

Barbara Duval is artwork explores t e mysteries ofthe human ﬁgure, utilizing negative space to make a statement

 

 

By Ryan Johnson
STAFF wmrsn

Mysterious ﬁgures populate the art-

work in Barbara Duval’s “Abandon,” J

the Staniar Gallery’s latest exhibit. Her
works provide a fresh and accessible
start to the 2011-2012 gallery season.

“The ﬁgure tells a story, whether
you are aware of it or not,” said Duval
at a lecture for students and faculty last
Wednesday. Her career has consistently
revolved around the human form, from
early drawings and etchings of models
to obscure shapes that she leaves open
to interpretation. ,

Most of the works in the exhibit are
either etchings or limited palette paint-

ings of groups of ﬁgures.

Mystery and layers of meaning are
constant forces in her art, she said, and
help to develop her artwork into a multi-
faceted narrative.

Anthony Kirby, a junior art major,
said the exhibit, “allows you to connect
to art on a more personal level.”

First-year Brian Morrison said, “the
gallery evoked a sense,of suffering in
me.” Christian Kennedy, also a ﬁrst-
year, was “amazed by the way Duval
used simple shadows and silhouettes to
portray the vivid emotions of mankind.”

Kathleen Olson, a W&L studio art

professor, agreed by saying, “Our stu-
dents can learn a lot from studying Du-
val’s powerful imagery and energetic
mark-making.”

The typical work by Barbara Duval is
an abstract, analysis of either a ﬁgure or
group of ﬁgures against a very intention-
al negative space. To Duval, this nega-
tive space — what she called “air” - is just
as important as the subject itself.

It interacts with the subject to create
the visual mood of the entire piece. She
also said the technique of mark—making
was important in creating a “web of sta-
bility” that compositionally anchors her

pieces. This stability holds in place the
ﬁgures that she often depicts in move-
ment.

Though most of the examples she

Paintball extravaganza!

Students and stay?’ ﬁre paintballs during

By Paige Gance
A&L EDITO R

Students and staff ﬁred 56,000 paint-
balls last weekend at the campus recre-
ation sponsored paintball tournament.
On Call Paintball provided the equip-
ment needed for the 230 participants,
who all played multiple matches.

RA’s brought their halls, fratemi-
ties and sororities organized teams,
and friends came in groups to face off
against each other in 3 v. 3, 4 v. 4, or 5 v.
5 games. On Call said they preferred to

limit the action to three on three or four
on four because the size of the arena was
not ideal for larger matches.

But often the line grew so long that
ﬁve on ﬁve matches were necessary to
allow everyone a chance to play. For
twelve hours total on Friday and Satur-
day, the pop of paintball guns and the
yelps of hit players echoed off the back
of the science building and library.

The rules were simple, if you get hit

once, even on your gun, then you are
out. One catch is if the paintball fails to
burst, it may hurt more, said one referee,
but you can stay in the game.

Each player seemed to have a differ-
ent strategy. Some sat behind the same
barrier the whole time, attempting to
snipe opponents across the ﬁeld, while
others made mad dashes through the
center, spraying shots haphazardly.

Many participants had never played

the campus sponsored activity on Friday and Saturday

paintball before, but the employees of
On Call would give out advice before
the match started or coach inexperi-
enced players who found themselves in
a tight spot.

Georgia, brings all the necessary guns,
safety masks, paintballs, and course ob-
stacles. Their inﬂatable barriers dotted

Staff works While Working out

T henew T rekDesk, a desk on a treadmill, can help W&L employees work on their ﬁtness while getting their work done

By Kelsey Cotter

Employees at Washington and Lee
can now work and walk simultaneously
thanks to a combination work station
and treadmill called Trekdesk.

This innovative idea began with Dr.
James Levine of the Mayo clinic and has
trickled down to Washington and Lee’s
campus under the supervision of Mary
Katherine Snead, assistant director of
human resources for work/life Initia-
tives and director of W&L’s wellness
program.

The desk itself costs $479.00 and the
treadmills used for them at W&L come
from the ﬁtness center.

Snead said there are currently three
onvthe W&L campus and that “people
are lining up for them”. The desk will
rotate to different employees so that
more people can try out the set up.

Catherine McElhannon, administra-
tive assistant to the theater department,
made room for the structure in her office
after hearing about the new device.

This year’s list of candidates in the American League appears
deeper than in years past, forcing fans to think twice before rushing
to select an obvious winner. A decade ago, fans were able to choose
among the usual suspects like Frank Thomas, Manny Ramirez,
Ivan Rodriguez and Ken Griffey Jr. among a few others. Pick any
name out of that group and it was easy to make a case for him to
win MVP.

S'l‘EPHE1 ’ PECK

“N0 hitter for Verlander through 7,” the text read from my Dad.

It was June 14th. The Tigers were playing the rival Cleveland Indi-

. / ans. And Detroit Tigers starting pitcher Justin Verlander was spin-
ning yet another gem. .

His no-hit bid was broken up with one out in the eighth that

night, but that did nothing to take away from his masterpiece. JV

So what’s changed? There are no usual suspects. What about
Mark Teixeira, David Ortiz, Vladimir Guerrero or Alex Rodriguez?
Can’t they claim that title for the last half decade? No. And that
reason makes it so hard to pick this year’s winner.

The difference lies in the numbers that MVP candidates put
up 10 years ago. They were gaudy. No, beyond gaudy—«obscene.

Sports writers Stephen Peckand Alexander
Maragos go head to head to determine
which Maj or Leaguer deserves to be the
American League MVP this year:

Gonzalez or Verlander?

ﬁnished with a complete game shutout, only giving up two hits
while striking out 12. ’

“The most dominant performance I’ve ever seen,” my old man
said once the game was in the books.

That kind of praise may seem a little over the top, but to those
who have witnessed JV pitch this year, it is entirely justiﬁed. Ver-
lander did not throw a perfect game versus the Indians that night, or

These men who tore apart pitching staffs for the better part of a
decade found themselves a part of a very exclusive club. They were
the only players perennially producing with such obscenity. Such a club no longer exists.

Gone are the days where our MVP candidates churn out a .333, 43 HR, 137 RBI season. I’m

_ looking at you, 2000 award-winner Jason Giambi. You can blame it on the decline of steroids, bet-
ter pitching, new bats, or whatever else you like. This much is clear, the playing ﬁeld is leveling
out. Instead of picking from a group of eight to 12 players in the race, the drop in production forces
the voter to consider as many as 15 to 20 players.

After much self-deliberation, my pick is Adrian Gonzalez. 1 know this might be the year (or
era) of the pitcher, but if Pedro couldn’t win the MVP in 1999, I don’t see a hurler taking it this
year .

Gonzalez has been as steady as they come at the plate, making 201 1 the ﬁfth straight year in
which he drove in 99 runs or more. As of Friday, he was hitting .337 with 26 HR and 111 RBI.

For a little perspective: in 1998, Albert Belle hit .328 with 49 HR and 152 RBI. He ﬁnished

' eighth in the AL MVP race. l’l1 say that again-—eighth! Even if Gonzalez reaches 30 HR and 120
RBI by the end ofthe season, there will be 13 players projected to be within 20 RBI of each other
at the top of this year’s RBI list.

In 1998, that number doubled as the top 13 run producers covered a difference of 40 RBI.

1 think you get ‘my point. Here’s why Gonzalez is this year’s AL MVP...

If the season ended today, Gonzalez would be among the top ﬁve in the league in six major
offensive categories including ﬁrst in batting average and RBI. He is also tied forﬁrst place in
AL Fielding Percentage with “Bargain of the Year” Casey Kotchman at .998. He has produced
throughout this up and down season for the Red Sox. ,

Boston lost its ﬁrst six games of the season on their way to an 11-15 April. They hit .243 asua
team that month, but Gonzalez kept Boston’s head above water, hitting .314 and accounting for 10
ofthe team’s ﬁrst 48 doubles. He then hit his stride in May, batting .341 with nine HR and 31 RBI,
propelling the Red Sox to a 19-10 month. The Red Sox knew that they couldn’t win the champi-
onship in the ﬁrst two months, but they could sure lose it. Gonzalez kept Boston from stumbling
into the dead of summer, and hit .404 in June to fuel a run to the top ofthe American League East.

Gonzalez put up stellar numbers month after month, even when free-agent dud Carl Crawford
was unable to get on base ahead of Gonzalez in the lineup. It’s fair to say that if Crawford had hit
like the Red Sox paid him to, Gonzalez would be blowing away the other AL MVP contenders.
But that’s what MVPs do: when things don’t go as planned, they ﬁnd a way to help the team win.

no-hit them, but he did redeﬁne dominance as the ability to make
major league hitters look foolish.‘It’s something he has done all year
and is one of the main arguments for his MVP worthiness. Verlander has electric_ stuff. He owns a
repertoire of 100 mph fastballs and otherworldy breaking pitches, all of which he can locate with
pinpoint control. And this year, he is simply and spectacularly untouchable. He is far and away the
most dominant player in professional baseball.

Every adjective in the book has been used to try and sum up what everyone is already seeing.
Overpowering. Nasty. Workhorse. Dynamic. Unfair. Perhaps that last one is the most telling. Ver-
lander has been like Danny Almonte in the 2001 Little League World Series: a man amongst boys.
And ifthere is one player in baseball you can say that so easily about then he clearly is MVP.

If you want to look at stats we can do that as well. Verlander has all the numbers to satisfy the
sabermetric nerds (he leads the league in wins, ERA, strikeouts, win-loss percentage, walks and
hits per innings pitched, hits per 9 innings, innings pitched, and games started), but I still don’t
think that’s the leading reason why he should win MVP. It is because he is asked to do so much as
the ace of the Detroit staff, and he always answers.

Detroit is a decent baseball team with some big name players and some even bigger holes. They
should be a .500 baseball team. Instead, they are the ﬁrst team in baseball to clinch their division
and are only three games behind the Yankees for the best record in the American League. They
have Justin Verlander to thank primarily for that.

Every time he takes the mound, Verlander is expected to win. With a 24-5 record, he pretty
much always delivers. 15 times Verlander has started a game following a Tigers loss. 15 times he
has won. Even more impressive is the fact that he has gone at least 6 innings in every single one of
his starts this year. He gives the Tigers a feeling ofinvincibility every time he is scheduled to start.
And that conﬁdence is invaluable. I _

Take Adrian Gonzalez or Jacoby Ellsbury away from the Red Sox and they are still a playoff
team. Take Curtis Granderson away from New York and the same can be said. But'take Verlander
away from the Tigers and you have a mediocre non-contending baseball team. It is as simple as
that. I

The detractors will simply whine that starting pitchers do not deserve MVP recognition. But
when you have a guy who qualiﬁes as the most exciting player to watch this year, a guy who has the
ability to throw a no-hitter every outing, a guy who can throw 100 mph in the ninth inning, a guy
who makes opposing hitters look as ifthey are swinging toothpicks, a guy who has 24 wins and a
guy who has lifted a middling ball club to the AL Central title, then I do not know what an MVP is.

Football is loss to Centre College Saturday marks the end of a nine game winning streak

By Jayna Johns ,
SPORTS EDITOR

Despite jumping out to a 14-0 lead
just six and a halfminutes into the game,

_ the Washington and Lee football team

fell to Centre College 42-35 on Saturday
evening in Danville, Kentucky, moving
to 2-1 on the season and ending its streak
of nine consecutive regular season wins.‘

The shootout included a combined
891 total yards on offense. The Gener-
als accounted for 450 of those, including
338 rushing yards

W&L found the end zone on the ﬁrst
drive of the game after taking the open-
ing kickoff and moving 67 yards on
seven plays. Senior quarterback Charlie
Westfal found sophomore tight end Alex
Evans with a 19-yard pass to give the
Generals a 7-0 lead only 2:44 into the
game.

The defense held strong on the Col-

onels opening possession, forcing a
3-and-out and giving the ball back to the
offense. W&L put together another solid
drive, this time covering 44 yards in six
plays and capped by a nine—yard touch-
down run by junior running back Sean
Pattwell to put the Generals up 14-0 with
8:34 left in the ﬁrst quarter.

The Centre offense found its engine
in the second quarter, reaching the end
zone for the ﬁrst time 50 seconds into
the second quarter off a one-yard touch-
down run.

The Generals responded with another
touchdown of their own, this one a six-
yard run by junior running back Luke
Heinsohn with just under nine minutes
left to play in the ﬁrst half.

A 40-yard touchdown pass by Cen-
tre put the Colonels back in striking

distance with less than two minutes be-
fore the break, and a 37-yard ﬁeld goal
attempt with seconds remaining on the
clock came up short, sending the teams
intotthe half with the Generals holding
on to a 21-14 lead.

W&L again scored ﬁrst to start the
second half when Heinsohn took off on
a 24-yard touchdown run to put the Gen-
erals up 28-14 with 10 minutes left in the
third quarter.

Centre responded with a four-yard
run into the end zone, and an ill-timed
fumble by the Generals on the ﬁrst play
of their next drive gave Centre excellent
ﬁeld position and the opportunity to tie
the game.

The Colonels capitalized on the Gen-
erals’ mistake, putting seven more on the
board with a one-yard run.

Tied at 28 with 3:50 left in the third,
the Generals regrouped and marched
down the "ﬁeld with an eight-play drive
that covered 80 yards. Junior running
back Brett Murray broke into the end
zone off an 11-yard run to give W&L its
ﬁnal lead, 35-28, of the game with 43
seconds left in the third quarter.

The Colonels tied the game up again
with a 67-yard run into the end zone with
1 1 minutes left to play, and the Generals
fumbled again on their next possession.
Centre returned the fumble to the W&L
36-yard line, and eight plays later, took
its ﬁrst lead of the game after a ﬁve yard
run put them up 42-35 with 5:43 left on
the clock.

A strong defensive effort by Centre
forced the Generals to go 3-and-out on
their ensuing drive, and the Colonels

W&L defeats F rostburg State on Sat., season record even at 3 wins, 3 losses .

By Jayna Johns
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee ﬁeld hockey team
brought its season record up to an even 3-3
with a 6-2 win over Frostburg State at W&L’s
Turf Field on Saturday aftemoon.

Leading the offensive attack was senior
midﬁelder Christina Benedetti, who scored a
goal and assisted on two Others.

The Generals’ opening goal came offa pen-
alty comer when Benedetti and sophomore de-
fender Lauren Boone assisted senior defender
Lizz Dye to take a l-0 lead less than two min-
utes into the game. .

First-year forward Candice Stefanie ex-
tended W&L’s lead to 2-0 after 22 and a half
minutes, but the Bobcats quickly responded by
nettin a enalt stroke two minutes and I2

 

 

seconds later. W&L was able to add to its lead
with an unassisted score by junior midﬁelder

Chelsea Stevenson to take the Generals into‘

the break with a 3-1 advantage.

Frostburg threatened early in the second
half, putting in an unassisted goal after just
over two minutes of playing time. That would
prove to be the Bobcats last goal, however, as
the Generals added three more scores and the

Bobcats were unable to get off another shot for

the remainder of the game. _

Benedetti scored ﬁrst in the second half for
the Generals at the 41:46 mark, and sopho-
more defender lziar Moure further extended
the lead with an unassisted goal just four
minutes later. For the ﬁnal score of the _

Zusi to put W&L up 6-2 with nearly 22 min-
utes of play left.

while allowing only one shot to get by. Fellow
junior Caroline Sutherland played the second
half.

F rostburg State keeper Maggie Edwards
played all 70 minutes in the net and managed
to record six saves.

The Generals will return to action on Fri-
day" when Bridgewater College visits for a
7:00 pm match.

Election time

F irst-years to vote today

By Neil Haggerty
co PY EDITOR

The ﬁrst-year Executive Committee and Student Judicial
Council elections will take place today after candidates gave
speeches Sunday night.

Despite a new Student Affairs initiative this year’ to en-
courage more women to participate, only one woman is run-
ning for the SJC. «

, “As a woman, it was so disheartening to see how male-
dominated the council was in Lee Chapel during O-Week,”
said ﬁrst-year Sommer Ireland. “I am running to add diver-
sity to the blazers and bow ties.”

At this point in time, there is only one undergraduate
woman represented in the EC and zero undergraduate wom-
en on the SJ C.

On Sept. 15, the Women in Student Government Panel
was held for ﬁrst-year women interested in having an impact
on the W&L community.

“Lack of Women in Student Government” has been a
topic of conversation in Student Affairs for several years, ac-
cording to Panhellenic Advisor Teri Cugliari.

“We had a nice size group of ﬁrst-year women [at the
panel],” she said. “It seemed to really motivate them.”

Cugliari said that she thinks there will be some “immedi-
ate results” from the Women in Student Government Panel in
the ﬁrst—year elections, but that “change takes time.”

More women are running for the EC than for the SJC.

Strike out for strikes

Student Judicial Council moves away

By Kelly Mae Ross
s TA F F w R l T E R

The strike system is dead, but in name only.

The Student Judicial Council and Student
Affairs Committee decided last year to phase
out the term “strike” and instead adopt the term
“incident” when it comes to violations of uni-
versity policy that fall under the jurisdiction of
the administration and/or the SJC.

“The terminology changed. The system
hasn’t changed and the practice is still the
same,” said Brandon R. Dotson, associate dean
of students.

Dotson said that the term “strike” wasn’t
really appropriate for use in an incident-based
conduct system. Members of last year’s SJC
saw that and decided to do something about it.

“None of the rules have changed. None
of the consequences are different,” said Tim
McAleenan, last year’s junior justice on the
SJC. “The changing of the language was just
to make it easier for students to understand that
there was no automatic suspension or expul-
sion associated with having a third conduct
violation.”

McAleenan said that the SJC also hopes
that the “softer language” of the incident sys-
tem will help quench student fears that the SJC
is out to get them.

“We’ve changed the language to try to make .

it clear to the students that the rules are actually
in their interest,” he said.

For many students, their ﬁrst conduct viola-
tions that involve the use of alcohol or drugs
are dealt with administratively (by a dean), not
by the SJC.

While the old rules may not have changed
under the newly named incident system, a few

new rules have ofﬁcially been added into the
university’s written conduct policy.

This year there is a new provision included
in the university’s policy on DUI. If a student
under the age of2l is arrested for DUI, the rec-
ommended sanction is suspension, no matter
whether it is the student’s ﬁrst, second or third
incident (or even their fourth or ﬁfth).

There have been no underage DUI incidents
this academic year, said Dotson.

The new rules also make it clear that stu-
dents who are of legal drinking age and con-
victed ofa DUI with a blood alcohol concen-
tration of'.l5 or higher will be suspended from
the university, according to information from
the Division of Student Affairs.

SJC Chair Matt Simpson said the SJC wants
to make it clear that the student governing
body treats DUI as one of the most serious of
offenses.

“Very few things in our conduct system are
automatic,” he said. “The only thing that I can
think ofthat’s straight out the door is .15 DUI.”

A second change made to the university’s
policies on alcohol and drugs says that students
can be punished ifthey.are “deemed an ‘acces-
sory’ to violations,” according to information
from the university’s Division of Student Af-
fairs.

A student may be deemed an accessory if
he, for example, does nothing about the fact
that his roommate smokesjmarijuana in.their
shared dorm room.

Although the accessory provision wasn’t
officially written into the rules last year, Simp-
son says that the SJC had established a sort of

from strike system to incidents

precedent for accessory rulings.

The probationary process has also changed.
The university’s new, cumulative approach to
probation means that students will now serve a
full 52 weeks (one year) of probation for each
incident that they amass, which wasn’t the case
under the old strike system.

“So if you get in trouble week 48, they’re_

going to tack on 52 more weeks from there and
you’re going to keep rolling,” said Dotson.

On a scale of I to 10, Simpson said he
thought the changes made during the switch
from the strike to the incident system would
rank no higher than a two or a three in terms of
how big of a deal they are for students.

“Ultimately nothing that we do will sig-
niﬁcantly change that much,” Simpson said.
“We haven’t changed the way we think about
things, we just have kind of made our reason-
ing more public and  more accessible.”

 

nformation about the university's
policy on drug and alcohol use and
other conduct unbecoming to a W&L
student can be found in the 2011-
2012 Student Handbook, available
on the school’s website.

“ Judging by their pale visages, it’s
unlikely that George Washington and
Robert E. Lee got much sun in their day.
But now Washington and Lee plans to
harness the sun’s power and bask in its
rays with clean energy beneﬁts of quiet
efficiency.

W&L signed a Power Purchase
Agreement on Aug. 5 with Secure Fu-
tures, a company that installs and oper-
ates solar energy projects. When com-
pleted, the school’s solar panel system
will be the largest in the state ofVirginia,
four times the size of the second largest
system located at the Eastern Mennonite

. University in Harrisonburg, Va.

The ﬁrst photovoltaic solar panel
array, located on the ramp to the upper
deck of the parking garage, will provide
120 kW ofenergy while the 330 kW sec-
ond array will be installed on the roof-
top of Lewis Hall. A university-owned
solar thermal array will be installed on
the Leybum library roof to provide hot
water for the heating needs of the build-
ing. The solar panels are scheduled to
be installed and operational by the end
of the year. I

‘ Q) “I really view the solar panel instal-

lations as a pilot program and a visual
demonstration of the University‘s com-
mitment to a sustainable effort,” said
Scott Beebe, director of Facilities Man-
agement.

According to the Climate Action
Plan drafted on January 15, 2010, the
ultimate goal for is to achieve carbon
neutrality by 2050.

Erik Curren, the director of mar-
keting and communication for Secure
Futures, said: “W&L has made a signiﬁ-
cant leap right now on the solar energy

_  capacity of Virginia. By investing in

clean renewable energy, [the University]
is setting an example for other colleges,
for the state, and beyond.” .

The solar panel system will provide

3 percent ofthe energy used on campus.
According to Beebe, the university will
also save money on the other 97 percent
due to the association of maximum ef-
ficiency of solar panels in the summer
to the cost of peak power times as deter-
mined by Dominion Power.

Curren, ‘87, said solar energy lines
up neatly with W&L’s motto.

“W&L has been around ‘for more
than 250 years because W&L‘ has always

been looking to the future,” Curren said. J

“Solar panels are the kind oflong-lived
infrastructure that will help Washington
and Lee continue to thrive.”

The installation of solar panels isjust
one facet of the entire sustainability ef-
fort on campus, which, according to the
plan, includes recycling, composting,

printing double-sided copies and grow-,

ing vegetables for the Campus Kitchen
Project.

Through its Climate Action Plan,
W&L hopes to reduce the utility opera-
tions budget by $1 million in two years,
reduce BTU’s (British Thermal Units)
per square foot on campus by 25 percent
by 2013, and to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by 20 percent by 2020. The
President’s Climate Commitment Task
Force, the Energy Usage Task Force,
and the University Sustainability Com-
mittee are three major groups charged
with coordinating the carbon neutrality
effort.

“There are skeptics who say clean
energy is not practical but W&L is prov-
ing them wrong,” Curren said. “It is not
something that you have to wait for the
future to do. You can do it right now.”

In addition to the beneﬁts from pro-
ducing clean energy, solar panels may
serve W&L in several other ways.

“Young people are more interested in
sustainability than they have ever been
before and sustainability on campus is
now one of the factorson the lists for

colleges,” Curren said. “W&L is joining
an elite group that has clean energy in-
stalled and this should help with admis-
sions.”

Beebe also said the solar panels may
function as an educational tool and as a
way to get students more interested in
sustainability.

Said Beebe: “I hope that the visibil-
ity of the panels will stimulate interest
in the students, faculty, and community.
One of the goals that I have, through
the solar installations and sub-metering
project, is that the solar panels will open
up the opportunity for class and indi-
vidual research. Why would it not be a
good idea for a student in the business
school to research the Power Purchased
Agreement? Why would it not be a good
idea for a student in the science depart-
ment to research the photovoltaic pro-
cess?”

The sub-metering project refers to an
effort that allows a diagnostic check of
each building. The information collect-
ed from the sub-meters will be compiled
into alsoon-to-be announced Energy In-
telligence System that will be open to all
students on the school website.

For now, the solar panels are still un-
der construction. Construction has be-
gun on the upper parking deck and panel
installation will begin on the law school
in a few weeks.

“The people at W&L will easily see
the solar panels at work,” Curren said.
“They will be a concrete symbol of the
University’s commitment to clean en-
ergy and a sustainable future.”

A behind the scenes view of the restaurant industry

Columnist Ali Greenberg ‘explains the ins and outs of working in a restaurant and describes proper demeanor for diners

It is my ﬁrm
belief that ev-
eryone should,
at one point or
I another, work
in a restaurant.
. I refer to res-
taurants specif-
ically, not only
I to learn the
value of a dol-
lar and develop
a work ethic
because any
job can teach
you that. Work-
ing in a restaurant can also offer the op-
portunity for important life lessons that
would beneﬁt us all.

There is no place better to learn hu-
mility, something a great portion of
W&L students have never had to ex-

‘perience. Waiting tables teaches time

management while emphasizing com-
munication skills and strengthening
memory. Serving requires a positive
attitude regardless of a customer’s bad
one, a backed up kitchen or breaking
two glasses of Ruby port.
You cannot get ﬂustered, you cannot
break down, and you cannot talk back.
. My ﬁrst restaurant job was during my

junior year in high school at an Italian
place that was delicious. Unfortunately,
the owner was as insane as his food was
good. One night a young couple came
in. Everything was ﬁne until the chicken
parmgan.

They didn’t like it, didn’t eat it and
didn’t want to pay for it. This didn’t fly
with Nino, who pulled the entrée out of
the trash, brought it to their table and
proceeded to cut the chicken in order to
prove it was cooked correctly and that it
would be included on the bill. I am not
kidding. I quit that night.

The restaurant world is a volatile
one, explaining why management can
be high-strung at times. It is a fast-paced
and high-risk business endeavor that can
reap large rewards or cause major loss-
es. A server has to be a problem solver,
able to handle sticky situations on her
own, and know when to ask questions or
let a higher-up step in.

Things can get stressful, but the ex-
perience will toughen you up. As the
saying goes, “if you can’t take the heat,
get out of the kitchen.”

A good restaurant, sensibly, is the
best place to learn about good food and
wine. (Sorry Cracker Barrel). And if you
are lucky enough that the chef allows
you near his mise en place, you will

learn more about produce and glazes
than you could have ever imagined.

Every W&L student should graduate
knowing the difference between truffles
from the ground and trufﬂes of choco-
late, basic wine pairings for reds and
whites, how to mix a real cocktail, and
when heirloom tomatoes are in season.
A true appreciation for food is nurtured
in the kitchen.

And you don’t need to know how to
cook to hold that appreciation. I can’t
make anything but a ﬁre in the kitchen,
but I can make a reservation at a great
place.

Dining out is an experience, and
waiters are there to facilitate that experi-
ence. Just because it is someone’s job to
serve you does not mean that you can be
rude or disrespectful. This brings me to
my rules and advice.

Do not come in 15 minutes before
closing time without a reservation.
While some nights this may not be a big
deal (lots of tables still there), on a slow
night this is a real pain in the ass for
those who have to wait around as you
take your time through three courses.
We don’t want to rush you out but time
is money, so ifyou insist on coming late
please buy a few bottles of wine.

Do not order seafood on Monday or

ever eat discounted Sushi. I worked at
a Japanese restaurant that offered Mon-
day night $l sushi, which was a great
deal. But that ﬁsh was fresh on Thurs-
day night, so while it is still technically
safe to eat, it is discounted because they
cannot use it the next day. Also, only or-
der scallops from a restaurant you trust.
They are too easily over or undercooked.

A 20% tip is the norm. Tip less for
bad service, tip more for excellent ser-
vice. Too often people assume that 15%
is acceptable for “good service,” but this
is not true. Many servers make their liv-
ing on tips and although you may think
our $2.50 hourly wage is enough, we
may disagree.’

I was told a long time ago that the
best judge of character is how an indi-
vidual treats a waiter and whether or
not they tip 20%. This isn’t a matter of
money either. If you make the conscious
decision to go out for a nice meal, you
should budget in an adequate tip and
order accordingly. Not tipping 20% for
good service is more bullshit than the
Ortiz knockout. I

If a restaurant offers a tasting menu,
order that. It will not disappoint and the
chef put a lot of work into it. Prix ﬁxe
menus are also a great way to get a deal
at a fancier restaurant.

We are happy to accommodate food
allergies, but make sure you differenti-
ate between “I don’t like that” and “I
can’t eat that,” or else you may have the
chef’s going through a lot _of extra trou-
ble to ensure an allergy-free meal. Also,
chefs hate vegans, just for the record.

Do not overcomplicate your order.
Waiting is not necessarily difﬁcult in
theory, but when you have three tables
and the 4-top wants four separate mixed
drinks, substitutions for their sides, de-
caf and regular coffee and extra bread,
it adds up. We are there to make your
experience great, don’t make it difficult
for us.

Try to make reservations. You will
be guaranteed a table, often a better one,
and will likely receive better service
since the wait staff and kitchen will be
expecting you.

For those dining out, my main point
is to treat the servers with respect, al-.
though I hope you already do. As those
who have worked in the restaurant in-
dustry can attest, while you serve others
all night, sometimes the only thing you
get to eat is humble pie.

It can be used as an attack; one candi-
date has claimed President Obama does
not believe in “American Exceptional-
ism,” because the president (realistical-
ly) stated that other countries probably
believe they are exceptionaltoo.

It can be used to answer nearly any’

question. Example:

Moderator: “Candidate X, many have
criticized your plan to reduce the deﬁcit,
saying that the numbers are a stretch at
best and are outright lies at worst. What
do you have to say to these critics?”

Candidate X: “Listen Moderator,
unlike my critics, I am a ﬁrm believer
in American Exceptionalism. When
the American people set their minds to
something, they can accomplish any-
thing. I think it is time that my critics
and the Washington establishment rec-
ognize this.”

Cue tons of applause.

Have to watch‘ the debate for a
politics class? Play the GOP Drinking

Game: anytime the phrase “American
Exceptionalism” is said, drink. Anytime
Ron Paul mentions the Federal Reserve,
drink. Or anytime Rick Santorum looks
disgusted, drink. It may make the de-
bate, at least, bearable.

The problem with “American Excep-
tionalism” is that it is not a real answer.
Sure it sounds nice, but consider about
what it is implying. If you hold to this
belief, you are giving the US Govem-
ment an indeﬁnite “get-out-of-jail- free”
card. It throws off the shackles of “real-
ity” and “responsibility” and holds that
no matter what America does, America
is right.

At the last GOP debate, Senator Rick
Santorum attacked Congressman Paul’s
view of 9/ I l . Santorum stated, “We were
not attacked, because of our actions....
they want to kill us, because of who we
are and what we stand for. And we stand
for ‘American Exceptionalism.’” Paul

stand the terrorist’s motivation for the

This kid has developed a system to rank
professional baseball players on what ac-

things that it boils down to: getting on base
and scoring runs. As a pitcher, one thing
matters: opponent batting average.

You see, baseball scouts are senile old

scouting players. Often times these scouts
will say things like, “this kid’s got a good
butt,” or, “he’s got an ugly girlfriend; no
one can hit with an ugly girlfriend.”

GOP debate attendees are normally such
reasonable people. Earlier that night,
when asked if an uninsured individual
who gets in a serious accident should
be let die, some members of the crowd
cheered out “Yeah!” At a previous de-
bate, the mere mention of the number of
people executed under Governor Perry
sent them into an excited tizzy.

I do love the country I live in. I feel it
gives me the most freedom of anywhere
else in the world would (very relative
statement). I just feel that it is not in the
“spirit” of America to assume that the
govemment does no wrong. The fact
of the matter is that America is run by
individuals and individuals are ﬂawed.
Ergo, America is flawed. I think that a
key step for America, moving forward
into this decade, is to learn Rule 51 from
NCIS: “Sometimes, you’re wrong.”

A homerun for the movie theaters

Columnist Patrick Smith encourages students to check out “Moneyball ”

Beane ran a slightly authoritarian style
of managing his program (shout out PE-
301. I see you workin’). The best part was
that he did not give a damn what anyone
thought about his process. He received
scrutiny for his methods, but it was based
on logic, so he did not care.

The bottom line to all of this is that you
should just see “Moneyball” when it comes
to the Lexington theater (if you can call that
a theater). I saw it opening night in Roa-
noke and the place was packed mostly by
non-baseball fans, which was the best part.

I will never forgive Barry Bonds for be-
ing such a horrible individual. He illumi-
nated a small part of the game and it over-
shadowed all of the remarkable things that
were happening. That is what “Moneyball”
is all about.

While Barry Bonds was busy inject-
ing himself with steroids and shrinking his
man parts, the Oakland A’s were defying a
flawed system and sticking it to the man.
Underdog stories are the best, and “Money-
ball” is no different. See the movie. It will
be worth the arm and leg you have to pay.

By john pauj Bea“ Wednesday, defeated by both

C 0 L U M N . 5 T Democrats and Republicans,

House leadership needs to

re-examine their role in this country’s government,

which is ailing economically while petty battles are
performed on the national political stage.

While it is heartening that a coalition of 230 Dem-
ocrats and Republicans combined actually formed the
ﬁrst vestige of “bipartisan” activity the government
has seen in a little while, the bipartisanship is not ac-,
complishing anything. The bloc of Democrats com-
plained that the bill contained too many harsh cuts,
and the 48 Republicans who peeled away from major-
ity rank and ﬁle unexpectedly complained that the bill
did not make enough cuts. Well at least they managed
to agree on how to vote.

The reason the pendulum swung back to Repub-
licans in the House last year was that America dis-
liked the way the House was being run under an over-
whelming majority of Democrats, and that regardless
of party, the real majority in the House was ﬁrmly in
the hands of ideological zealots either unwilling or
unable to compromise on an agenda. The fact that this
bill, relatively minor housekeeping, ran into a wall is
an embarrassment on several levels.

  

First, it reveals that the fundamental problem with -

the institution still remains under the surface. Con-
gress has forgotten how to compromise in the midst
of political warfare, leaving the basic function of the
American government an unmanned helm. The defeat
of this bill demonstrates that a consensus has not been
solidly fonned. If such is the case, then the bill ought
not to have been put to a vote. Speaker Boehner is un-
fortunately placed in a position where he must move
Congress forward, but in order to do that he must also
become a facilitator of compromise. The 48 naysayers
disrupted Republican cohesion at the last moment. If
they were interested in compromise, they would have
brought up their reservations about the bill earlier and
tried to work to ﬁnd common ground for passage.
Such an action could have no other beneﬁt but for the-
atrics and to embarrass party leadership.

Even if one does not have a taste for the amount of
cuts being made, the problem with these ideologues is
in the childish “all or nothing” mentality. A problem-
solver and _a statesman would recognize that some-
thing is better than nothing, as long as the group is
moving in a general direction.

There is apprehension about the size of the debt,
which the Congresses of the last decades up to the
present are responsible. With a debt so large, improve-
ments are not going to happen overnight, but big races
begin with small footsteps. Turning around the largest
out-of-control budget is more like turning a battleship,
and less like ﬂipping a light-switch, so gradualism is
the only answer. ,

The mandate rests with the Republican majority
of 2010 to do what the Democratic majority of 2008
would not do to them-— treat the minority with some
respect and establish dialogue across the aisle. If the
Republicans fail in doing this sufficiently, then their
platform will be an uphill battle the entire way to the
polls, and their majority may be weakened or lost.
Furthermore, as one of the most visual representations
of the party-out-of-power, the mandate is on them
to behave with honor, because their conduct will af-
fect the public opinion of the Republican Presidential
nominees, and eventually the Presidential candidate.

If Congress is unable to do what it should, the
GOP nominees need to start speaking up and bring-
ing leadership to the table. As Republican leaders of
at least some respectable position, they can comment
on the political affairs of the country. They are more
entitled to do so than members of the pop culture are-
na. If Canadian citizen Justin Bieber can make a com-
ment about Congress and American politics (granted
a snide one), and our nominees cannot, then there is
a problem. This country is suffering from several ail-
ments, but the biggest one of all is the lack of states-
men and leadership.

When you begin to consider who to vote for in the
upcoming elections, put some thought into it. Truly
think about the candidates and their platforms, but
also consider their unifying capabilities and their abil-
ity to lead. It is time for us as voters to consider what
we can do for this country.

You’re

that neon

and biker

feel as though you are invincible. At
the moment when you feel like you

in all her glory to the star of this
week’s video, “Beyoncé Clown.”

YouTube’s “Beyoncé Clo.Wn”
video is the perfect example of what
can happen when one gets a little too
ambitious on the dance ﬂoor. While
the star of this video is lucky enough
to be in the privacy of her own home
wearing an identity-concealing
clown mask when she makes a danc-
ing faux-pas, you are in the middle
of a dance floor surrounded by your
classmates. In this situation, you
have a few options to try to regain
your composure:

l. Deny ‘til you die. Obviously,
your best friends (no matter how
embarrassing you look) are going to
help you out by picking you up be-
fore you get trampled by the aggres-
sive DFMers surrounding you on
all sides. If this is the case and the
crowd is so engrossed in their own
dance ﬂoor romances that they didn’t
even notice, this is the perfect time
to pretend like it never happened and
pull the classic deny ‘til you die. So
just stand up, brush off your leotard,
and resume grinding like it’s 1999.

2. Blatant acknowledgement.

In this scenario, your approach is
to be bigger than the situation and
completely accept the fact that you
have just made a fool of yourself.
This takes a very conﬁdent person
or someone who has had a few re-
freshments served from a‘ trashcan
or turkey baster. As you stand up
from your fall that resembles that of
another YouTube sensation (“Scar-
let Takes a Tumble” — check it out
people), you simply yell out what an
“AWESOME TIME YOU’RE HAV-
ING” and how you “DON’T EVEN
FEELATHING, BRAH!”

3. Run away dramatically. If you
lack this kind of conﬁdence or prox-
imity to the keg, or the fall was sim-
ply too much to recover from on the
spot, this is your game plan. Grab
the hand of your closest dance part-
ner and run to the nearest bathroom.
After knocking obnoxiously and
yelling that “THIS IS AN EMER-
GENCY, PEOPLE,” get in there
and collect yourself (make sure it’s
locked or your friend is leaning her
leotard-clad self against the door
that’s probably missing a doorknob).
Spend a few minutes in there ﬁxing

your hair and wiping off your span-
dex, but remember — don’t waste too
much time missing out on Run DMC
and being concerned about how you
look because every single person out
there looks like a train wreck anyway
and probably doesn’t remember your
fall anymore.

4. Dance on the ground. This
tactic is one of our favorites. Sim-
ply pretend that you totally planned
this ~ it’s your signature dance move,
people. You obviously, meant to drop
straight to the ground and booty-pop
right back up. Everyone’s going to
love it. Trust us. If you can pull it
off, you will become the life of the
party.

So the next time you approach a
dance ﬂoor, don’t be afraid to shake
what you got/drop it low/dougie/pop
lock and drop it/cat daddy etc. You
now know a few_simple yet effective
techniques for overcoming an un-
fortunate situation. Trust us, we’ve
used them, and they work. You just
have to fake it ‘til you make it.

A casefor collecting art

F irst-year Ryan Johnson describes a favorite hobby he believes every student should try

Remem-
ber, for one
second, the
last song or
music album
you bought.
If it was
- Bon Iver’s
' self-titled
album, then
you made a
great choice
and I would
love to get in
touch with
you. Friend
me on Facebook and we can go from
there.

If not - say you were complet-
ing your Ke$ha collection with Ben
Folds’ cover of “Sleazy” - then you
have room to improve, but I respect
that too. The point is you added to a
personal music library that you have
probably been building since middle
school.

The application “Tidy Songs,”
which organizes users’ electronic
music libraries, would probably
agree with me that our music collec-
tions are more well-cared for than
a ferocious cow lick on a ﬁrst date.
Tidy Songs reported in a recent study
that the average customer’s iTunes
library contains 7,160 songs. That’s
more than seven straight days of mu-
sic listening if each song is three and
a half minutes long. And these are
songs you have not only gone out
of your way to listen to, but also to
download.

Also consider your movie collec-
tion. Right now, you probably have a
weeks’ worth of television shows and
movies stashed away (electronic or
otherwise): entertainment to which
you’ve dedicated many a night.
Movies are different than songs in

C)(;LUMyNlST ‘Those nasty
dark ware-

houses full of old moldy clothes? I
mean, you have no idea who wore
that stuff, where it came from, or
what they, what they... did in it. And
you shop there? I think I am going to
stop reading right here.

But wait --- don’t! Let me clarify
a few things. First of all, thrift stores
are not always dank and nasty. They
don’t always smell of mothballs.
And they deﬁnitely don’t always

5,

that we only own a small percentage
of the ﬁlms we’ve -seen. Regardless,
we feel a societal pressure to keep up
with the latest movie releases. Some
of us are even so concerned with
having our personal stash of music

and movies that we will go to legally -

questionable lengths to accomplish
this. That, however, is a matter for
another article.

So people have obscene amounts
of music, which caters to the ears.
And we have our favorite ﬁlms,
which gratify the ears and eyes. What
about just the eyes? Where are our
art collections? Most of us don’t pay
nearly enough attention to the visual
art world, as compared to the music
or ﬁlm worlds. We don’t collect or
appreciate art like we would music
and movies. This, I say, is a ﬂaw that
can be easily remedied.

Let me ﬁrst describe what I mean
by an “art collection.” I use the
phrase loosely because a lot ofwhat
we collect could be very infonnal,
rather than “ﬁne” art. We may simply
“collect” art for ourselves by buy-
ing a catalog of Mark Rothko’s color
ﬁeld paintings. Plastering our walls
with movie posters is, I admit, also
the beginnings of an art collection.
It is an effort to dress up what little
wall space we have, to uphold an
aesthetic sensibility. Posters, prints,
sculptures, original drawings, paint-
ings, and even digital images are all
items that one might collect.

Don’t think that collecting art is
beyond or below you. Non-artists
(for lack of a better term) have as
much of a role in the art world as
the actual artists. The most cursory
glance at art history will reveal this
much; some of our greatest art was
commissioned. A patron wanted a
portrait done or a church wall to be
decorated, and our museums are still

have really sketchy people in them.
(Wait, they do, but that is half of
the fun). I remember the incident
of the “Boxer Lady.” My little sis-
ter and I were whiling away a lazy
Saturday at our local Goodwill (San
Antonio, incidentally, has the best
thrift stores in the nation) when we
saw this oddly—dressed lady. She had
on a huge, bright yellow, tenycloth

“dress” that reached down to her feet V

and large snow—boots. We were in-
stantly curious. As we furtively fol-
lowed her around the store, we saw
her make a bee-line for one thing: the
men’s boxer section. Now, who buys
used-underwear? I do not know, but
someone must because they still sell
it. “Boxer-Lady” bought every pair
they had — from little boy to adult.
She even bought the Whitey Tighties
(gasp). We were intrigued. She has
lived in our memory ever since.
Then there is the treasure hunt.
T hriﬂ stores are a treasure hunt.
You know that there’s a vintage
Prada little-black-dress hiding there

thanking them. Now, our galleries do
much of the commissioning, but the
work gets done still the same. There
are plenty of avenues for owning art.

It may be odd to think about col-
lecting art now, but picture yourself
as an adult. Now realize that you are
an adult. The time is now. Make no
mistake; an art collection is classy.
In the near future, it will give a soul
to your home and a conversation
topic to your guests. It may become
a lifelong hobby of yours to invest in
art, especially if you are a business
major. But there is more to owning
art than practical matters. Having a
reﬁned artistic taste is the mark of
a gentleman or gentlewoman. Art
brings aesthetic pleasure, much like
music or movies. In fact, viewing
art helps one better appreciate music
and movies in the aesthetic dimen-
sion. Art moves the viewer to reﬂect.
One’s artistic sensibility affects how
one views the world and vice versa.

You don’t have to buy art this
week or even this month. Start in a
simple way by looking for art that
you like. Grow a garden of digital art
that you enjoy looking at. Though art
on a computer screen doesn’t com-
pare to the real piece, it can be relax-
ing and educating to simply scroll
through artists’ websites and contem-
plate art.

Maybe the only museum trips
you enjoyed as a wee one were to
exhibits of Andy Warhol. If so, re-
search the street artist Banksy. Keep
an eye out for new art to ﬁnd styles
that you like. Visit the galleries on
campus and around Lexington. This
may sound silly, but if you really en-
joy a work by a fellow W&L student,
ask for its price. Chances are they
will be more than willing to get their
art out into the world. Browse art
magazines and websites and Google

somewhere. You just have to search
through an entire rack of discarded
school jerseys and 80’s workout suits
to ﬁnd it. My favorite pieces that I
have found are: a Gucci change

‘ purse, a Burberry raincoat, and this

adorable little pair of unlabeled black
heels— of course I pretend they are
Manolo Blahnik. These are all the
perfect accessories for my wardrobe
of preppy, casual, classic clothing.
It’s the details that matter, right? It’s
also the advertising. For those of you
who share my love of thrift stores
you will already be very familiar
with the word “vintage.”

“Oh, so Sally, where did you get
that really cute little vest?”

“Oh, that? It’s vintage.”

Sometimes it’s too much trouble
to explain to the unbelievers where
you got that item of clothing. It’s
enough that they like it.

For those of you who just got to
Lex, you will also soon learn the
usefulness of our little Goodwill.
Pathetic as it is when compared to

the artists whose work you enjoy.
Don’t be turned off if you feel the
art around you is kitschy or boring;
I can personally guarantee that there
is enough art out in the world to suit
all of our tastes. As a personal aside, I
have recently enjoyed viewing work
online by Andy Goldsworthy, Adrian
Villar Rojas, and Dan Tague. Take
that as you will.

If price is an object, prints of art-
work - the kinds of prints you would
buy at a museum gift shop, say - are
a good way to start small. Prints are
certainly a cheap alternative to tak-
ing out a monstrous loan for an old
masterpiece. Frame the prints for the
instant feeling of legitimacy. But in
reality, current art is really not that
expensive. You can buy an original
drawing from a gallery for less than
the price of a single console game,
though prices will vary widely. Ac-
quiring just a few pieces of art that
you really enjoy will demonstrate the
addicting pleasure of ownership.

Lastly, don’t feel that you are to
blame for having little or no cur-
rent interest in collecting art. The
art world itself is probably at fault
here, as our current artists thrive on
the conceptual approach to fine art.
In true hipster fashion, many artists
purposefully remove themselves
from mainstream culture by creat-
ing intellectually focused art. Part of
the joy of collecting art, however, is
deciphering and enjoying the visual
subtleties within your collection. For
the love of all that is tasteful, de-
velop your artistic collection while
you have the time and energy. Make
it your new [school] year’s resolu-
tion to explore a side of culture that
should have been familiar territory
by now.

out of the closet

ls thrift store shopping a fashionista is treasure hunt

big-city stores, yet it can yield sur-
prising little nuggets of usefulness
when, for example, Halloween or
Christmas Weekend roll around.
Wonder where I got my bright green
Christmas sweatshirt with the jingle-
bells and light up Rudolf nose? You
bet. ’

So don’t be hating. Thrift stores
can be fun --- sketchy fun, it’s true,
but then isn’t sketchy fun always the
best? Plus, I’m not alone. This past
week, a certain male from a certain
fratemity who is known for dressing
well, volunteered that he had got-
ten his tie at a thrift-store. Wonders
never cease. So if you’re bored one
day over Thanksgiving break, con-
sider taking a little trip to your local
treasure chest. There is most certain-
ly something waiting there for you.
And for those of you who already
share my love of these places, it’s
time to come out of the closet. No
more “vintage.” Let’s wear it loud
and proud. Isn’t that what fashion is
all about?

Fighting sexual harrassment in the ﬁrst-year dorms

F irst-year Andrea Siso describes how a fun visit to a friend is dorm room turned into a humiliating nightmare

My friend

4 Sarah and I
I A . always visit
the dorm room

of our other
friend, Mark.
Besides con-
taining the
greatest snack
stash known

to man, Mark’s
room is bigger
than a janitor’s
closet and has
two windows.
This guy’s liv-
ing the life.

The only problem with Mark’s room
is its location.

It sits at the end of a very long boys’
hall. And let’sjust say if curious glances
could burn you, I’d probably burst into
ﬂames every time I visited him.

   

By Andrea Siso
COLUMNIST

My apprehensions were blatantly vo-
calized last Thursday evening. We were
all watching a bout of YouTube videos
when Sarah wanted to use the restroom.
“Come with me,” she said, “I’m scared
of being stolen!” We all laughed, but
maybeshe jinxed us because her fear
soon became pretty warranted.

It started with Mark’s neighbors.
Faceless voices would leer, “How you
doing?” amongst background choruses
yodeling, “Woooo! WOOOOO!”

Then we walked down the hall.

The desperate cry of “Girls? Girls?
GIRRRRRRLS!” was ﬂung from an
open doorway to our right. Oh, and, I am
not kidding you, one guy even shouted,
“Do you come here often?”

Even though Sarah and I practically
ran, the trip to the stairwell seemed to
last ages. I can remember my face bum-
ing and a physical inability to take my
eyes off the beige linoleum tiles in front

of me. And when we ﬁnally reached the
staircase, I looked at Sarah and an in-
credulous guffaw was ripped from my
mouth. Did that seriously just happen?

I know that they probably didn’t
mean anything by it, but I felt really, re-
ally uncomfortable. It reminded me of
a moment on a family vacation to Can-
cun four summers ago. I was walking
down the poolside deck to meet with my
parents, when old lecherous men kept
ogling me and shouting things like, “Ay
mamasita!” Um, no. Sorry Mr. Rogers,
I am not your “mamasita.” I was four-
teen. Fourteen.

I thought that at least W&L guys
would be more conscious of chivalry
and honor, but I realized that maybe I
made too generous and too hasty of a
generalization. Only those driven by
basal instincts would ever holler sug-
gestive pick-up lines to two girls in-
nocuously decked out in sweatpants and

baggy tees, walking down a hallway.

But, no, the story does not end there.
Sarah and I grudgingly made the trip
back to Mark’s room, this time full-on
running to avoid any sort of external
contact. When we had to pause to turn
his doorknob, we heard a group of voic-
es shouting “OOOHHHHHH!” from the
room next door.

We told Mark what had happened.
He walked into his neighbor’s room.

“What’s up?”

“I see you’re doing some work on
two bitches, man!” slimed the leader of
the pack. His cronies grunted in support.

I’m not really sure what else was
said. Shock deafened me.

“Did they really just call us bitches?”
I asked Sarah.

“I hate being called that,” she softly
replied. I agreed.

And that was overlooking the whole
“doing some work” bit. But I think we’d

already been through enough that night.

I believe that as a person, I deserve
the right to be able to walk without fear
or humiliation to visit with my two best
friends. I believe that as a female stu-
dent, I shouldn’t feel hindered at all by
my gender; I shouldn’t feel demeaned,
and I shouldn’t feel objectiﬁed in my
own college dorm building. I also have
faith that these guys are better than this.
I’m not sure what they thought they’d
gain from acting that way; you could’ve
swom they’d never seen a girl before.
But, really, the way to gain a girl’s at-
tention is not by degrading her, it’s by
respecting her.

And anyway, if the option ever arose,
I personally would want to date a guy
more advanced on the evolutionary lad-
der.

How to feel easy like a Sunday morning all day long

You wake
up, relieved
to learn that
the giant
grain bucket
chasing you
down Lee
Highway was
only part of
a nightmare.
Your throat
is so dry it’s
burning. Your
hair smells
like smoke
and beer._
Your body is so sore you wonder if you
fought in a mixed martial arts competi-
tion last night. Half of you wants to stay
in bed and the other half wants to get up
and try to make yourself feel better.

And just when you are starting to
nod off again, you remember—oh, no.
Sunday morning. I have three essays
to write, a test worth 30 percent of my
grade tomorrow, math problems that will
be checked at the beginning ofclass, and
200 pages of reading. You pinch your-
self and hope that these thoughts are
also parts ofa nightmare. But, they are
all real.

This is a moment that most every
W&L student knows. From the halls of
Graham-Lees to the shores of the Maury
River can be found Sunday-syndrome-
victims. Next weekend, follow this

Symptoms of the Investment Banker Phase

guide so that you can feel fresh, accom-
plished and relaxed. Before you know it,
Sunday will totally be the new Friday.

I. Set an alarm: A key to being pro-
ductive is forcing yourself to wake up
with a little bit of urgency. Lingering in
bed and half-sleeping until 1 p.m. is a
waste of time. Set your alarm for a time
when you can realistically wake up and
have enough sleep to feel rested. I usu-
ally set the alarm for 9:30 a.m. and press
snooze until 10 a.m. I suggest setting
said alarm before you go out on Sat-
urday night. With the way things have
been going recently, you may want to
set your alarm on the earlier side so that
if you have an unexpected run-in with
the LexPo, you will be able to get home
from jail before lunchtime.

The night before, make morning
plans with someone. I’ll meet you at
Co-op at 10:30. See you in D-hall at
11. Giving yourself a reason to get up
and having someone else hold you ac-
countable will force you to get your act
together.

2. Feel clean: Start off by allowing
yourself a nice long tooth brushwforget
singing “Happy Birthday” twice. Turn-
ing on Parliameht’s “Knee Deep” and
not putting the tooth brush down until
the end of the song will serve you a lot
better. Now that all of that tequila and
late-night pizza is out of your system,
it’s time to focus on your skin.

For those who can shower and get

ready in less than 20 minutes, I recom-
mend a quick, cold shower. For those
of us who are plagued by hair that gets
frizzy if it is not blow-dried and straight-
ened, I recommend a long face scrub
and foot wash to get all of the body
glitter, eye make-up, and Windfall mud
off your skin before hitting the books.
Play some soothing music while getting
ready. Turn off your Betchezz Gettin’
Crunk playlist and turn on something
like Lionel Richie’s “Easy (like a Sun-
day Morning).”

. 3. Have a nutritious brunch: Resist
the temptation to pour butterscotch chips
and caramel sauce on your wafﬂe at D-
hall. As much as I love to pretend that
stufﬁng my face will miraculously make
me feel better (just one more cookie will
do the trick), it will not. First, decide
whether you are in the mood for break-
fast food or lunch food. Being in «the
mood for both will result in a disgust-
ing mix of coffee, orange juice, bacon,
sausage, pancakes, and syrup followed
by a burger, fries and a Diet Coke. Yuck.
If you choose breakfast, something
like oatmeal and a banana or toast and
peanut butter will give you energy and
make you feel good. For lunch, I rec-
ommend a turkey sandwich and some
veggies from the salad bar. Do not get
near the fountain soda. Force yourself to
chug two full glasses of water. They will
momentarily make you feel sick, but
will help you in the long run. After that,

I recommend more water or a cup ofhot
tea. You can also have some dank azul
(blue Powerade), but too much of it will
make you feel gross.

Limit yourself to a 30-minute meal
so that you have time to gossip, but do
not waste the day away dwelling on
meaningless details (i.e. boys bragging
about how many brews they crushed and
girls analyzing the football star’s motive
for telling their friend she looked beauti-
ful). Now that that’s out of your system,
head to the library with a clear mind!

4. Block Facebook: When you arrive
at the library or wherever you prefer
to study, allow yourself l5 minutes of
Facebook. Then, sign off and block it.
Not blocking Facebook is the equivalent
of putting an oversized jersey in front of
a Beta and telling him not to wear it. The
temptation is overwhelming.

For those 15 precious minutes, check
for new ,up_loaded pictures and stalk
that cute boy or girl you met last night.
When you start feeling tempted to mes-
sage him or her because you realize that
the two of you have a random friend in
common, sign off and log onto SelfCon-
trol to block Facebook for the next three
hours.

5. Turn off your phone: Every second
we spend checking the time or rereading
funny text conversations from the night
before adds up, so do yourself a favor
and shut off your phone.

Before doing this, shoot your mom an

“I’m okay” text. I don’t know about you
all, but my mom usually likes checking
in on weekend mornings to make sure
that I’m okay. She thinks she is being
slick by disguising these check-in texts
by asking an “urgent” question. Let’s
be honest, does she really need to know
what sneaker size I wear at 9:13 on a
Saturday morning? Probably not. Do
your parents a favor and tell them that
you love them so that on the off chance
they try to contact you when your phone
is off, they will not get nervous.

6. Write a To-Do List: Boys, this bet-
ter not be a list of girls’ names...

Put together a list of everything on
your mind, from homework assign-
ments to phone calls you need to make
to plans to go to church. This will make
you feel in control of your schedule and
relaxed. Approximate how much time
each task will take so you will not daily
or convince yourself it is reasonable to
spend two hours reviewing how to ﬁnd
the median, mean and mode for your
statistics class.

7. Get Started: Get yourselfa big cup
of tea and some gum and get started.
Think positive thoughts and when you
get tempted to dream off and think about
how you looked in your toga, remember
how wonderful and accomplished you’ll
feel when you can crawl into bed at a
reasonable hour tonight!

Happy studying!

Opinions Editor Campbell Burr describes how to rebound from late nights and feel calm and focused on Sundays

What happens when boys decide they want adoration, status, and baller toys? Columnist Stockton Bullitt tells all

Around
the middle of
junior year, a
strange thing
starts happen-
ing to boys
on campus.
They go from
being passive
aggressively
competitive
about frater-
nities, and
instead start
worrying
about their fu-
ture careers.

However,
after spending more than a few years
only thinking about women and alcohol,
starting a career is only a fuzzy idea. All
guys know is that making lots of money
seems pretty nice. Money brings adora-
tion, status and some baller-status toys.
Those three incentives seem to be the
primary motivating factor in the transi-
tion from caring about fraternities to
caring about careers. So, when career
decisions are being fonnulated, most
guys think to themselves, “Which job
will get me the most adoration, status
and baller-status toys? Doctors won’t
make enough money in 20 years thanks
to ObamaCare. Lawyers have to read
too much and don’t start making money
until 30. So, I guess I should be an in-
vestment banker.”

I-Ionestly,‘ that’s pretty much the
whole thought process. Once each guy

. decides that being an investment banker

is the best way to becoming adored, high

class and the owner of baller-status toys, /

he has to ﬁgure out what an investment
banker actually does. But then he real-
izes that actually knowing what the job
entails is pointless because obviously he
will be taught that once he gets the ca-
reer. So, he focuses on what he thinks is
the most important aspect of becoming
an investment banker: sounding like an
investment banker. Thus begins one of

the most adorable phases of the W&L
male’s college career, the Investment
Banker Phase.

Obviously the Investment Banker
Phase isn’t exclusive to W&L. I ﬁrst
noticed the Investment Banker Phase
in two friends who attend NESCAC
schools. Like the virus in “Contagion,”
the Investment Banker Phase has an R0
of four to ﬁve, so it’s spread to pretty
much everywhere. But if one attends an
Ivy or NESCAC school or a Southern
version of an Ivy or NESCAC school
(Georgetown, Duke, W&L, etc.), the
Investment Banker Phase is especially
prevalent. Also, the Investment Banker
phase isn’t exclusive to men. Consid-
ering they work harder and get better‘
grades, women from W&L are rightfully
taking up an increasing share of invest-
ment banking jobs. But since I’m not
invited to sorority lunches, I don’t know
the extent that the Investment Banker
Phase actually affects women at W&L.
I never hear girls talk a little too loudly
about their oversold equity picks or drop
some resume stats in casual conversa-
tion. Women probably have this problem
too, but I just don’t know.

Just because you know someone who

I says the word “NASDAQ” every day,

doesn’t mean that he or she is in the In-
vestment Banker Phase. There are some
people at this school who have been into
ﬁnance since a young age. They watched
CNBC more than Nickelodeon growing
up, and they feel the same way about EV/
EBITDA that I do about VORP. These
are the ﬁnance nerds, and they are in the
middle of their glory years. The number
of hookups they missed in high school
because “Mad Money” was on has been
offset by social hegemony over the ma-
jority of males at W&L. The Investment
Banker Phasers always defer to the sud-
denly omniscient ﬁnance nerds because
they are the ones who supposedly know
the game. Still, the ﬁnance nerds should
be treated with respect. Their love for
money and banking is genuine and will
continue when the Investment Banker

Phase turns into the My Kid is Better
Than Yours Phase in 10 years.

So what actually constitutes the In-
vestment Banker Phase? Well, here are
a couple of symptoms that should show
you if your friend has transitioned from
the Fraternity Phase into the Investment
Banker Phase. Remember that these
symptoms cannot have been prevalent
during the Fraternity Phase. If they
were, your friend is a ﬁnance nerd.

1) He talks about equities a little
too much. If he spends more than ﬁve
minutes telling you why Bank ofAmer-
ica will rebound, you know that he has
chugged the Jonestown Kool-Aid. For
that matter, if he uses Bank of America
in a sentence without also using “ATM,”
you should be worried. Just know that

l by the third time that he’s reminding you

about Warren Buffets faith in Bank of
America, you will want to shoot him in
the face.

2) He starts resume’ dropping in
casual conversations. Look, fraternity
lunch is NOT an information session.
Nobody cares how impressive your GPA
is. Just know that when your friend is
doing multiple résumé drops per sen-
tence, you should consult a physician.
This is the kind of sentence you will hear
from most Investment Banker Phasers:
“When I was talking to the President
of Ford, who by the way is a [insert
fraternity here] alum, he told me how
impressed he was with my upper level
mathematics knowledge, and he, too,
was the head of his investment society in
college. We’re boys now.” One way that
most Investment Banker Phasers prac-
tice this habit is by playing the “One Up
Game.” It’s like Jenga. Just talk to your
friend and keep reminding him that your
achievements are just a little bit better
than his are and wait to see who runs out
of things to say. The most impressive re-
sumé stat wins. «

3) He starts talking to you in a
patronizing tone even though he doesn’t
know anything more than you do. An
important aspect of power is having

subjects, and since investment bankers
have power, Investment Banker Phasers
want to practice ruling over people with
their supreme omniscience, so they start
with their friends. Conversations are
now accompanied with raised eyebrows
and annoying smirks. Investment Bank-
ing Phasers need to remind you of their
inherent superiority by throwing in the
occasional “Oh, you didn’t know that?”
and “You didn’t get the interview?”
Most W&L Investment Banking Phasers
are well practiced at this because they
would throw in the occasional “Oh you
didn’t get a bid?” or “Oh, you weren’t at
the rush trip?” during the height of their
fraternity phase.

4) He has fully converted to
the IB religion: The Street is God. De-
pending on the denomination, value
or growth is the Holy Spirit, and each
Banker is Christ incarnate. The Invest-
ment Banker Phasers dismiss their old
interests in pursuit of the holy IB relicsz‘
BMW’s, Manhattan ﬂats, “American
Psycho” style business cards and gold
watches. Of course, the priestly cloak is
replaced by a ﬂashy, “It’s as expensive
as it looks” suit.

If you’re friend is in the Investment
Banker Phase, don’t worry too much. As
long as he regularly goes to the doctor to
make sure that his hubris tumor hasn’t
gone malignant, he should grow out of
the phase around month three of work
when he realizes that working until one
every night isn’t that fun. I promise that
he won’t get annoying again until the
My Kid is Better Than Yours Phase.

Since I couldn’t ﬁgure out a good
way to both conclude this article and
allude to the fact that I am fully in the
Investment Banker Phase, I’ll just throw
in an extended analogy that has nothing
to do with this article. “Saturday Night
Live” is exactly like professional box-
ing. Both have gone from mainstream
culture inﬂuencers in the decades before
we were born to niche fomis of enter-
tainment. They appeal to certain types
of people who follow them religiously,

while also constantly being the source
of tired media ridicule for not being im-
portant anymore. Eddie Murphy was to
comedy what Mike Tyson was to sport.
Tina Fey and Manny Pacquiao are both
respected by the greater community and
devoutly followed by a small group of
fans. ,

More importantly, I have the same
conclusions with both “Saturday Night
Live” and professional boxing. It is
pointless to say that either of them will
“die” in the near future. It is a tired, stu-
pid argument. Both have a certain group
of people that are passionately devoted
to them, and moreover, the entertain-
ment quality has in no way diminished
in the years. Ortiz—Mayweather was
fantastically exciting, and the open-
ing episode of this season’s “Saturday
Night Live” with Alec Baldwin was
exquisite to watch. Furthermore, every
couple of years, both professional box-
ing and “Saturday Night Live” become
very relevant. Professional boxing will
become center stage in American culture
when Pacquiao and Mayweather eventu-
ally go at it, and “Saturday Night Live”
becomes the centerpiece of American
political culture during each Presidential
race.

However, “Saturday Night Live”
and professional boxing will NEVER
become the consistently relevant and
important entities they once were. There
is simply too much selection in today’s
entertainment choices for each to thrive
consistently. Furthermore, our cultural
values have changed so much that va-
riety shows and sports that encourage
concussions cannot rise to cultural rel-
evance anymore.

So, when you hear someone say that
either professional boxing or “Saturday
Night Live” will be dead in ﬁve years,
you know that he or she is an idiot.
Likewise, if you hear someone say that
professional boxing or “Saturday Night
Live” is on the verge of becoming the
next hot thing in American culture, you
know that he or she is an idiot.

Travelling bluegrass band, Chatham County Line performed free for W&L students in Commons last Wednesday

By Scott Sugden
STAF F WRITE R

More than just dinner was being
sewed in the Marketplace last Wednes-
day night. Chatham County Line, an
internationally touring bluegrass band
from North Carolina was dishing out
free music to all who came to listen.
Booked in July, the concert was the ﬁrst
part of the Common Grounds Live Mu-
sic Series.

Wunda chair deemed “Wunderbar”

The concert opened at 6:30 p.m. with
a show by Drew Martin and the Lime-
lights, a student band, before Chatham
County Line took the stage at 7 p.m.

This was “the biggest concert I’ve
ever put on here” at Washington & Lee,
says Kelsey Goodwin, coordinator of
Elrod Commons and the one responsible
for organizing the concert. After receiv-

ing consistent feedback from students
who wanted to see more live music
events, Goodwinﬁgured, “let’s do it.”
Senior Chris Veddern said, “I ﬁgured
I’d go and see what they’re all about,
I’ve never heard them before.”
Goodwin saw Chatham County Line
perform at the Mockingbird, a restaurant
and music venue in nearby Staunton,

and felt they would be a “really good
fit” at Washington & Lee. With their
popularity steadily rising, Goodwin said
she wanted to “book them here while we
still can.”

The event was free and open to the
public thanks to the generous support of
WLUR, Washington and Lee’s radio sta-
tion. Starbucks coffee was also on sale at

the concert.

Mark your calendars: the next group
in the Common Grounds Live Music Se-
ries is The Cinnamon Band, scheduled
to perform Oct. 27. They are looking for
another student band to open the show,
so if any student bands want an oppor-
tunity to perform live, contact Kelsey
Goodwin. '

Looking to escape the gym for a while? Kelsey Cotter explains why Pilates is worth a second look

By Kelsey Cotter
STAFF WRITER

Tools such as the Reformer, the
Wunda Chair, the Cadillc, Trapeze table,
spring boards, and barrel may intimidate
the casual exerciser, but they help shape
the elegant figures of men and women
who use them in advanced Pilates.

Pilates is an excellent way to escape
the mundane atmosphere of a gym, and
work muscles all over your body.

Erin Garvin is a certiﬁed Pilates in-
structor in Roanoke, Va. at EmPower
studio. Upon ﬁrst meeting Garvin it is
hard not to stare in awe at her impec-
cably toned ﬁgure and inviting smile.
Her infectious excitement about Pilates
makes this form of exercise sound entic-
ing. To Garvin, Pilates is not merely a
workout, it is a way of life.

“Pilates is about alignment and prop-
er movement and it can help you for the
rest of your life” says Garvin. Garvin,

now 39, is an avid mountain biker and
enjoys kayaking. She ﬁrst became inter-
ested in Pilates in 1997 after traveling
across the country to California.

“In California, Pilates studios are like
Hardees restaurants here in Roanoke,
they are everywhere!” said Garvin, and
she brought her passion for Pilates back
to the east coast.

Garvin, however, was not always the
long, lean woman she is today. She said
that before Pilates she was built a bit
like a wrestler. She had the bulk and the
strength, but found back extensions re-
quired in Pilates challenging. Overtime,
Pilates toned, stretched and aligned her
muscles, giving her the ﬁgure of a beau-
tiful dancer.

“So often people focus rigidly on
hammering out bicep curls at the gym
that they fail to work the muscles that

lift you up and support you,” she said.

She says that Pilates helps her in
every aspect of her life, especially in
mountain biking. “My shoulders don’t
hunch and I’m able to breath steadily
during a hard workout on my bike,” said
Erin.

Marty Call, a resident of Roanoke,
Va., takes classes with Garvin at Em-
Power. She competed as a body builder
from the age of 24 to 27 in Wythville,
Charlottesville, and Virginia Beach. Call
changed direction after age 27 when she
realized that she had pushed her muscles
to their limit.

“I was as big as I was going to get
naturally”, says Call. She met a Pilates
instructor in Charlottesville, which led
her to the Reformer machine that she
now has in her house.

The Reformer allows for stretching

and strengthening your muscles through
resistance bands that are attached to the
machine. Call explains that for her Pi-
lates is a totally different type of work-
out that focuses on your stabilizer mus-
cles, which keep you balanced and long.

“I still lift weights twice a week. A
little bit of everything is good for your
body”, says Call.

Anne Lemon of the Washington and
Lee development office teaches an af-
ternoon Pilates class open to faculty and
students. She said that Pilates translates
into everything you do in life, from
walking to weightlifting.

“The number one area of awareness I
like to focus on is the shoulders because
of how much they are used”, says Lem-
on. As far as posture and body aware-
ness go, Lemon said that Pilates assists
unquestionably in both.

“You learn to hold your core still
while moving, which targets deeper ab-
dominal muscles” adds Lemon.

Sophomore Abbey brown devotes
the majority of her workout time to Pi-
lates. “I love it. It’s relaxing, but it raises
my heart rate. I use muscles I didn’t
even know I had”, said Brown.

The more advanced Pilates Fusion
class led by Jessie Knadler is held on
Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5:00-
6:00 p.m. Intermediate Pilates is held
on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays
from 10:10-11:05 a.m. Pilates with Anne
Lemon is held on Tuesdays and Thurs-
days from 12:15-l :10 p.m.

Stan Kamen Gallery transports Viewers into the West

The exibit includes paintings, photos and statues from the American West displayed in Lenfest and Leyburn

By Gabrielle Tremo
STAF F warren

“As evidenced by the paintings,
prints, and sculptures in the Kamen Col-
lection, the fascination with the Ameri-
can West continues today” - Plaque be-
side painting, Leybum Library.

America has always been fascinated
by the West. Maybe it is an age we wish
to revisit, ﬁlled with discovery, revolu-
tionary idealism, bravery, independence,
and natural human intuition. Or perhaps
it was the idea of the open plains with no
boundaries, no barriers and only a night
under the placid ebony sky awaiting
you. Whatever it is about the West that
fascinates us, we can now experience it
vicariously in the Stan Kamen Collec-
tion that graces the walls of the Lenfest
Center and Leybum Library.

Stan Kamen ‘49 donated this West-
em Art collection to Washington and
Lee in 1986. “Although he was a na-
tive of New York City,” reads an exhibit
description, “Kamen became a true son
of the west ﬁlling his home and ofﬁce
with paintings, prints and sculptures re-
ﬂecting his love of horses and the west-
ern landscape. The Kamen Collection
brings a view of the American West and
particularly of the “Old West” that has
been created by some of America’s fore-

most twentieth-century western artists.”

The collection is indeed exquisite
and, while similar in genre, ranges
greatly in its depictions and its media.
The hangings in Lenfest range from de-
tailed and vibrant watercolors to classi-
cal, profound oil on canvas. The medi-
ums themselves are diverse, featuring
everything from modest, yet masterful
pencil sketches to solid bronze statues.
They also speak to the genuineness and
the wealth of culture that existed in this
time. These pieces depict everything:
from the simplest everyday actions, like
a Native American woman slowly, me-
ticulously washing a bowl, to the things
of Western legend, like the celebrated
buffalo hunt.

In the back of the gallery hangs a
large, imposing acrylic on canvas by
Ray Hare. The prominent head of a Na-
tive American chief sticks out against a
deep purple background. The paintings
artist, Ray Hare, is well known for his
natural imagery, but this piece is special.
Itiwas taken from an old photo, in the
age when the West was still wild and the
essence of the culture was alive. “In this
painting,” reads an information card,
“the use of purple gives the impression

of a black and white photograph. By
placing the proﬁle so close to the edge
of the canvas, Hare gives the impression
oflooking through a magnifying glass at
the Native American culture.” Looking
into the painting is like interviewing an
ancient man, a man who has seen and
experienced more than could be possi-
bly told. The texture of the worn skin
and the feathers on his headdress give
the painting an unimaginable realness.
But the most striking feature on the
piece is the chief’s eyes. They glimmer
with wisdom from the dead center of
the photo. The strong proud authority
shown here is a timeless image of the
culture it represents.

The walls are lined with many oth-
er exquisite representations of West-
ern life, including detailed sketches of
horses and riders by Gordon Philips,
the life of a rancher on the open plains,
a gold panner in the mountain streams
and rocky cliffs, and images of the ma-
jestic buffalo. The exhibit has whimsi-
cal pieces, such as a tribe riding trium-
phantly home on horseback, as well as
poignant images of the decline of the
west, such as a wounded man lying
alone in the snow. These symbolize the

myth, the reality, and the mystery of the
West, from the culture and people to the
untouched landscapes. Each photo is de-
tailed, each sketch lifelike, each statue
so genuine that the viewer is transported
to the place that the art depicts.

As you gaze upon the streamlined
brush strokes or each individual scratch
of pencil lead, no longer are you standing
in the Lenfest Center, with its dimmed
glowing lighting and the chill of the air
conditioner. You are standing at the riv-
erbank. Water runs over your dry, dusty
feet. The sun is bright on a hot after-
noon—it beats down on your flapping
linen clothes. You smell the smoke ofthe
lunchtime ﬁres, of smoking vegetables
and fresh meet, and the sweet fragrant
birch wood that surrounds the valley.
From your right, elegant men in vibrant
colors emerge from the wood atop wild,
painted stallions. In the distance, beyond
the dusty plain, mountains glimmer like
iridescent jewels under a clear, vast blue
sky. From your pocket, your cell phone
beeps, and you are no longer ankle deep
in cool, crisp»/mountain water, but stand-
ing, wide-eyed at Gordon Philip’s vivid

, oifpainting, “Council Meeting.”

It is with great satisfaction that I sug-

gest walking down to Lenfest to visit
this enthralling gallery. While one could
get lost in these photos, paintings and
statues for hours, even ten or twenty
minutes would allow for a wonderful
experience. The time that one devotes
is well worth the satisfaction received:
a trip away from that Calculus test on
Friday, a world away from the unﬁn-
ished paper, a vacation from the chilly
Lexington fall and into a frame of blue
skies, clear weather and sun-dappled
life. The Stan Kamen Gallery provides
more than a glance at the portraits it fea-
tures, but an actual in-depth look into
another time and another place, one of
wonder, majesty and grace. The West.

The Stan Kamen Gallery can be
found on the first ﬂoor of the Lenfest
Center, adjacent to Wilson Hall. It will
be featured until December.

Famous oceanographer Visits

Dr Sylvia Earle serves as a role model for women pursuing a career in the sciences

By Cynthia Lam
5 TA F F w R I T E R

World-renowned oceanographer Dr.
Sylvia Earle delivered the first talk of
the Women in Science lecture series in a
packed Stackhouse Theater last Monday
night.

“Earle is truly a pioneer in her ﬁeld,
and she has accomplished amazing
things,” said Geology Professor Dr.
Lisa Greer, who organized the event and
founded the series. “We really wanted
to have some big names,” she said, “so
students could have strong female role
models and see women in successful,
high proﬁle positions in science.”

Earle has spent over 7000 hours un-
derwater for her research and Library of
Congress has called her a “living leg-
end.” She holds multiple diving records,
was Time magazine’s ﬁrst “Hero of the
Planet” in 1998, and is currently a Na-
tional Geographic explorer-in-residence.

During her lecture, “The World is

Blue,” Earle described the role of new
technology in helping humans under-
stand and protect the ocean.

“Technology has changed our per-
spective of the planet. Now we can con-
nect the dots in ways that we couldn’t
before,” said Earle, referring to new
ocean display features in Google Earth
5.0, which has allowed scientists to chart
the identities and locations of undersea
organisms.

According to Earle, only 5 percent
of the ocean has been mapped with the
same amount of accuracy as the land.
“We’ve barely scratched the surface -
literally - in terms of the depths of the
ocean, she said, “The greatest era of ex-
ploration is just beginning, and most of
it is wet.”

This is a growing problem because
humans are rapidly depleting marine life
and showing no intention to stop any

time soon.

“We know how to catch tuna, how
to eat them, and how to prepare them in
a number of ways, but we don’t know
how to put them back into the system
after they’ve been depleted,” said Earle.
Consequently, only 10 percent of the
original tuna population is left today.

Despite the daunting facts, Earle re-
mains optimistic about the future. “The
good news is that people now care about
the environment in ways they couldn’t
have before,” she said, “we can change
our ways. We have the power, we have
the time, and that time is now.” She
encouraged audience members to learn
about oceanic life and gain awareness of
these issues.

Biology Professor Dr. Larry Hurd
agreed with this message. “Knowing
how nature works gives us a handle on
how to live with it,” he said, “People

can best prepare themselves to solve
problems by learning as much as pos-
sible about what is really going on. This
requires carefully listening to what sci-
ence is telling us.”

The lecture had a large turnout and
received positive reviews. “I was
thrilled to see a packed room, and lwas
so happy to see so many young women
in the audience,” said Greer, who also
said she hopes this program will encour-
age more females to pursue careers in
science.

First-year Sara Korash-Shiff said, “I
felt a sense of pride seeing a woman in
the sciences accomplishing such amaz-
ing things in her ﬁeld.”

David Dennis, a biology and envi-
ronmental studies double major, was
also impressed by the distinguished
scientist. “Dr. Earle was a very engag-
ing speaker,” he said, “and highlighted

many areas that need further research
with the oceans and environment, which
could potentially be my future calling.”

The next speaker in the series will be
historian Dr. Naomi Oreskes, who will
talk about the history of women in sci-
ence on Monday, Nov. 14.

ALEXANDER MARAGIDS

Grace and power—few activities combine these adjectives bet-
ter than hockey. When the playersiwhisk up and down the ice con-
trolling the puck, the game resembles a choreographed ballet. But
when two players battle for position, hockey quickly becomes a
collision sport showcasing strength and tenacity. The game is an
irresistible mix of ﬁnesse and force.

S'l‘EPIlE1 I PECK

Wade Belak was a I4 year NHL veteran who retired last March.
He had a wife and two young daughters.'

Belak stood 6’5” and weighed 225 pounds. He amassed 8 goals,
33 points, over a thousand penalty minutes, and 136 ﬁghts over his
career. Belak was an enforcer: a guy who is essentially paid to ﬁght,
to protect the team’s star player, and provide a hulking, intimidating

Fights are the epitome of aggression in hockey. They have been
a part of the game since the sport was invented. I’ll be clear—I’m
not the meatball who is going to oppose a ban on ﬁghting just be-
cause it started on a frozen lake in Canada over 100 years ago. I
like the 3-point line, helmets, the designated hitter, mouth,,guards,
and other improvements and rule changes in sports.

However, ﬁghting cuts too close to the core of hockey to ban it.
Confrontation is an integral part of the game, and whether they’re

Hockey, a notoriously aggressive sport, may

be undergoing some changes in the future.
Many want to see rules implemented to -
decrease the violence, while others believe
ﬁghting is a part of the game. Stephen and '
' Alex give their own opinions.

physical presence.

Wade Belak is dead. The 35-year-old hung himself in his To-
ronto condo on August 31. g

Last May, another tough guy in hockey, Derek Boogaard, died of
an accidental overdose of alcohol and oxycodone. He was 28. Rick
Rypien, an agitator for the Vancouver Canucks, committedsuicide
on August l5th. H-e was 27

Alllthree were not on NHL rosters because of their offensive

punching each other in the face or not, many hockey players see
aggressive play as an important step to victory. Take the term “enforcer,” for instance; that is truly
a hockey term.

Do we really think that players will stop trying to hurt each other if we forbid them to drop the
gloves? Without ﬁghting, hockey players will ﬁnd new (and perhaps more dangerous) ways to take
their aggression out on opposing players.

According to hockeyﬁghts.com, a “ﬁghting major”» penalty was handed out in 37% of NHL
gameslast season. Am I the only one that thinks this is surprisingly low? I would have guessed
somewhere between 45% and 50%.

37% seems low because fans perceive ﬁghting to be a bigger part of hockey than it actually is. I

Fans are bombarded with images of ﬁghting hockey players. Watch a string of hockey highlights
and what do you get? You’ll likely see a couple of goals, maybe a shootout highlight (if you’re
lucky) and probably footage of a ﬁght if there is one.

Remember, ﬁghting is technically illegal in the NHL. That’s why players receive penalties and
go to that little box to get mocked by people like “The Green Man” in Vancouver. NHL ofﬁcials
are extremely good at breaking up a ﬁght after there is a clear winner and loser. This year’s NHL
Rulebook has ﬁve and a half pages devoted to ﬁghting and how the ofﬁcials should properly dif-
fuse a_ ﬁght. The referee and linesmen often prevent senseless confrontation beyond what the two
players signed up for when they dropped the gloves.

Sure, I go to a game because I want to see good hockey, but I watch sports to be entertained.
A hockey ﬁght is very entertaining. I derive value from sports because of how they make me feel.
There are many arguments that sports are more than games in many respects, or that they are really
becoming a business more than anything. In the end, all the team really sells is a feeling. Hockey
teams sell a better product with ﬁghting as a part of the game.

The main criticism is that ﬁghting has serious short and long term consequences for players.
If hockey players really .wanted to improve their health, they would stop ﬁghting each other or
push for a ban in the next NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement. Those are short and long term

solutions. Nobody is really making the players ﬁght; they have a choice, and they’re choosing to

continue play this way. ,

Hockey is deﬁned by its physical play. If you don’t believe me, take it from one of America’s
greatest comedian’s, the late George Carlin. Carlin once said of hockey, “Hockey is three activities
going on at the same time: ice skating, playing with a puck and beating the s**t out of somebody.”

 

prowess. Belak and Boogaard’s roles were clearly deﬁned. They
were paid pugilists on skates, hired goons who earned their keep with their ﬁsts, rather than their
scoring touch. In hockey, it is about accountability. The logic goes, that ifyou want to take a cheap
shot at a star player, be prepared to ﬁght that team’s tough guy the next time you are on the ice.

But in light of these tragedies, there has to be a change. Many people are hesitant to link.these
deaths to ﬁghting. I’m not. .

We are only scratching the surface of ﬁnding out what ﬁghting does to a person mentally and
physically. The blood on the ice is easy to see. So are the stitches and scars on an enforcer’s face.
The brain trauma is not quite as easy to deflect. Years of smashing bare-knuckle ﬁsts to heads takes
a toll, and degenerative brain diseases are being discovered in hockey ﬁghters.

Bob Probert, widely regarded as the best ﬁghter ever in the NHL, died last September at the age
of 45. His brain was donated to researchers and it was discovered that he had widespread chronic
traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease caused by multiple concussions. I

Probert had his demons. He battled alcohol and cocaine problems his whole life. And I’m go-
ing to go out on a limb and say that had something to do with his role as an enforcer. Drugs can
be a coping mechanism, an escape from the reality that when you go to work each night, you are
expected to ﬁght someone.

Todd Fedoruk, another NHL tough guy who has battled drug addictions, echoed that senti-
ment in an AP story earlier this month: “Could the pressure ofﬁghting make you want to pick up
[drugs]? Yeah, I think that can be a trigger. I think it is a trigger. For me, it was. You just want to
forget about having to fight the guy. You line up against a guy like [Boogaard], God rest his soul,
but he’s 267. He’s a big man. You think about that a week before you ﬁght him.”

Recently retired Georges Laraque, a legendary hockey ﬁghter in his own right also spoke ofthe
hellish life of an NHL enforcer to the Minnesota Star-Tribune: “This mental struggle is constant,
because when this game is over, then there’s the next [ﬁght], then you think about the next guy, and
after a while this can drive you crazy.”

All this and for what? You can’t say that ﬁghting allows the players to police themselves and
that it’s honorable and respectable when two men agree to square off. I understand that hockey
is an emotional sport and a skirmish will sometimes break out for that reason. But to say that the‘
threat ofa ﬁght is a deterrent to cheap shots holds no weight with me, because clearly head shots
and dirty play still exists in the game today. A simple solution is ramping up the penalties. Want to

elbow Sidney Crosby in the head? Sit out for 10 games with no pay. At the end of the day, hockey .

is these players’ income. They don’t want their paycheck taken away. They can deal with ﬁghting
someone; they can’t deal with losing money. I
. And to say that hockey without ﬁghting would turn a lot of fans away is-asinine. There is not
much ﬁghting in playoff hockey and none at all in the Olympics (why waste a roster spot on a guy
who can’t contribute offensively?) and those are hugely popular events. Hockey is a highly skilled,
fast paced game. Fighting has no part in it.
Hockey is a beautiful game with a dangerous problem. People are dying now. That should be
enough to say “no more.” i
From the same Sun-Times article is a story about Brantt Myhres, another hockey player who
fought to make a living. Myhres had just fought Laraque in a preseason game in 2005. Myhres
needed surgery to repair broken bones in his face. i

“I was done,” he said. “I was physically and mentally exhausted from the role. I walked out [of
the locker room] and I couldn’t see out of my eye. It was totally swollen shut. Ijust started breaking
down. I said I can’t do this any more.”

Myhres could not afford to ﬁght any longer.
Neither can the NHL.

Volleyball streak ends

W&L ’s record season-opening streak ends at 13, but the team is back

By Angela Williams
5 TA F F w R 1T E R

It had to happen eventually. The Washing-
ton and Lee volleyball team suffered its ﬁrst"
loss ofthe season in a 3-1 decision to Geneva

_College on Friday afternoon, the ﬁrst day of
the Pioneer Classic at Marietta College.

The Generals had extended their winning
streak earlier in the week whenthey moved
to 13-0 on the season, and 4-0 against ODAC
competition, with a 3-0 sweep of Bridgewatcr
College. They easily took down the Eagles
25-12, 25-19, 25-10 Tuesday afternoon.

Sophomore outside hitter M.A. Boles con-
tinued her offensive power, recording 14 kills
and hit to ﬁnish the match with an incredible
.778 hitting percentage, tying the fourth-best
mark at W&L. Hitting percentage in volley-
ball is avratio of kills to attempts.

‘ Contributing to‘ W&L’s success, senior
outside hitter Megan Daily added ﬁve kills
while senior middle blocker Lindsey Dee had
four. Sophomore setter Meghan Meleski ac-

 

counted for three of the General’s 10 service
aces, and leading the defensive side, junior
libero Cameron Hill led the team with seven
digs. Boles was right behind her with six.

The Generals limited the Eagles to hitting
only .054 for the match.

The team’s best start in program. history
came to an end in its next match. Geneva took
down the Generals 3-1 on Fpiday evening,
winning the ﬁrst set 25-23 but dropping the
next three 18-25, 18-25, 23-25.

Hill had an outstanding 24 digs, while
ﬁrst-year setter Corinne Hemmersbach added
19 and Boles came up 17 more.

Senior outside hitter Megan Daily provid-
ed the General’s offensive power, recording
14 kills, while junior right side hitter Taylor
Maxey had 11 kills and three blocks. ’

The next morning saw the team’s second
loss, as Marietta got the best of the Generals
in straight sets, 25-16, 25-21, 25-16.

 

to winning

The Generals got back to their winning
ways later that afternoon against John Car-
roll, rallying in the ﬁfth set to take the match
25-16, 25-9, 23-25, 22-25, 15-11. The victory
moved W&L to 14-2 on the season and still
4-0 in ODAC play.

Boles was back to her dominating ways,
leading the team in both kills and digs, with
17 and 20 respectively, while also adding
three blocks. Daily was right behind her with
16 kills, and Dee recorded 13 kills and lead
the team with ﬁve blocks.

First-year defensive specialist Kelly Mc-
Manus served up six aces and contributed to
the defensive side with 17 digs. Maxey tal-
lied nine kills for the match, and Meleski was
there with 48 assists, 10 digs and two blocks.

The women will be back in Lexington on
Tuesday totake on conference-foe Eastern
Mennonite at 6:30 p.m.

cots can’tstop comeback

A school-record 65 7 gives W &L the win over A/ma College in a 49-42 shootout

By Jayna Johns
SPORTS EDITOR

In a game dominated by the offenses, the’
Washington and Lee football team came up
with a fourth-quarter comeback to pull out a
49-42 win over Alma College at Wilson Field
on Saturday afternoon. The win moves W&L
to 3-1 on the season.

The Generals accumulated 444 yards
on the ground on their way to racking up a
school-record 657 total yards. Alma ﬁnished
with 475 yards, 350 of which came from the
passing game.

W&L entered the fourth quarter trailing
by only one point, but an early touchdown by
Alma made the score 42-34 with only 13 min-
utes left in the game.

A short drive later, however, the Generals
also found the end zone when junior running
back Brett Murray, who accumulated 200
yards in the game on only 15 carries, ran for
15 yards and six points. Senior quarterback
Charlie Westfal hooked up with sophomore
tight end Alex Evans for a two-point conver-
sion, tying the score at 42-42 with 10:38 still
on the clock.

Fumbles by both teams on their ensuing
possessions left the score tied with neither
threatening. On their next attempt, and with
fewer than six minutes remaining, the Scots
entered the Generals’ red zone. Senior line-
backer John Kavanagh rose to the occasion,
intercepting an Alma pass at the 9-yard line

and returning it 22 yards to give the Gener-
als possession on their own 31-yard line with
5:47 left to play.

W&L marched methodically down the
ﬁeld, moving 69 yards on 11 plays and reach-
ing the end zone on a 4-yard run by junior
running back Luke Heinsohn. With only 37
seconds remaining on the clock, the Scots ran
out oftime and the Generals secured the win.

The game began with W&L ﬁrmly in con-
trol. A six-yard touchdown run by junior re-
ceiver Russell Stewart put the Generals on the
board ﬁrst, and a 20-yard ﬁeld goal by senior
placekicker Peter Alston put the team up 10-0
to end the ﬁrst quarter.

Alma ﬁrst got on the board with 7:20 re-
maining in the half after a short drive ended
with a four-yard touchdown run, bringing the
score to 10-7.

On the ﬁrst play ofthe next drive, and only
20 seconds later, Murray took off on a 62-yard
touchdown run to bring the Generals’ lead
back to 10. W&L added even more to the lead
on their next possession when Westfal found
senior receiver Tate Davis for 54 yards and a
score.

A second Alma touchdown and a 35-yard
ﬁeld goal by Alston as time was running out
sent the teams into the half with the Generals
leading 27-14.

The Scots started off the scoring for the

third quarter, reaching the end zone with a 21-
yard pass. The Generals managed to take ﬁve
minutes off the clock on their next drive, as
they went 76 yards in 12 plays, capped with
a four yard run by Heinsohn for a touchdown.

Holding onto a 34-21 lead, the Generals
encountered problems on both sides of the
ball. Alma proceeded to score 21 unanswered
points and take the lead for the ﬁrst time all
day. W&L managed to ﬁnd the points it need-
ed before time ran out to pull out the win.

Westfal was nearly perfect through the air,
making 13-of-16 passes for a season-high 213
yards and one touchdown while also carrying
the ball 13 times for 72 yards. Heinsohn re-
corded his own season high after rushing for
123 yards and two touchdowns on 26 tries.

On defense, senior linebacker Rob Look
came up with a team-high nine tackles, and
junior linebacker Stephen Peck added eight
tackles and a pair of sacks. Kavanagh record-
ed two interceptions along with two tackles.

The previous mark for most yards gained
in a game was 652, set in a 67-7 win over
the University of Richmond in 1950. With
his ﬁve attempts today, Alston has now made
61-straight PATS, a school record.

The team will be back on the ﬁeld this Sat-
urday for Homecoming as they start confer-
ence play against Guilford. Kickoff is set for
1:30 p.m. at Wilson Field.

to school

By Happy Carlock
STAF F WRITE R

About 800 guests travelled from
all over the country to reunite with old
classmates and cheer on the Generals.

For the past three years, Young
Alumni Weekend has brought former
students back to Washington and Lee for
the Homecoming football game and ﬁve
ten—year reunions. Executive Director
of Alumni Affairs Beau Dudley helped
developed the ﬁrst Young Alumni Week-
end in 2009. -

“This is an event that we created just
three years ago when we realized that
we were not doing right by our youngest
alumni,” Dudley said. “We asked a num-
ber of young alumni to help us design it
so it would appeal to that generation of
students.”

Originally, all alumni were invited to
Homecoming weekend, but quality and
attendance fell over the past 15 years.
The Alumni Association reorganized the
weekend in order to bring more alumni
back and improve connections with re-
cent graduates.

“What we discovered is that we were
pairing our oldest alumni ~ people who
had attended their 50th reunion — with
our most recent ﬁve graduating classes,”
Dudley said. “lt’s hard to construct a
weekend that will make both of those
groups happy, so we simply converted

Homecoming weekend into Young
Alumni Weekend.”

The Alumni Association now holds
three reunion weekends: Five Star Fes-
tival in September, Alumni Weekend in
early May, and Young Alumni Weekend
in October.

Assistant Director of Alumni Af-
fairs Jen Utterback, the mastermind be-
hind the organization of Young Alumni
Weekend, began.scheduling the week-
end a year ago.

“Once last year’s Young Alumni
Weekend ended, a day or two later I
booked all the hotels, but my conference
calls and main focus on it was over the
summer,” Utterback said. “The regis-
tration goes out in July, so pretty much
from July 1, it’s game on.”

The weekend began Friday for re-
turning alumni with registration and a
campus tour at noon, followed by class
receptions at 6:30 p.m.

“All young alumni are welcome
back, but we honor the ﬁfth and tenth re-
unions with class receptions,” Utterback
said. “At the class receptions they take
their class photos and present their class
gifts. President Ken Ruscio accepts the
checks and gives briefremarks, thanking
the class for raising the money.”

On Saturday, alumni attended a tail-

gate on the law school lawn before the
Homecoming football game, but the
main event of the weekend took place
Saturday night.

“The ﬁnal event, which is the biggest,
is the wine tasting and barbecue on the
front lawn on Saturday night from 6:30
to 9 p.m.,” Utterbacksaid. “We have a
live band, and six Virginia vineyards
that bring their wine and set up booths so
people can go around and have a taste.
We also have Virginia beer coming this
year, and W&L catering does their great

About 550 alumni and their guests at-
tended‘ the wine tasting, along with the
Class of 2012. Recent graduates such
as Christine Balistreri ’ll, enjoyed re-
connecting with old friends. Balistreri
is now an admissions counselor in the
W&L Ofﬁce of Admissions.

“I’m most looking forward to ev-
eryone coming back and attending the

The fair will act as both a recruit-
ment event ‘for state chairs and an op-
portunity for students to talk to state

“This is the last opportunity to get

Balistreri said she decided to work
in the admissions ofﬁce after graduating
as a way to give back to the University
and help shape its future. She said she

“It highlights the special bond that
every graduate has to W&L,” she said.
“How many schools have as good of a

Task force to review resi

President Ruscio is charge leads to review of all aspects of residential life at Washington and Lee

By Drew Carlos
5 TA F F w R IT E R

President Ken Ruscio has decided to
take action towards improving residen-
tial life at Washington and Lee. A resi-
dential life task force will be reviewing
all elements of residential life this fall.

Dean of Students Sidney Evans said
this type of review is “something that
universities do periodically because you
want your residence halls to have the
amenities and the programming that stu-
dents expect.”

Evans said the task force is to “look at
residence life all across the board: facili-
ties, programming, ﬁrst-year, and upper-
class.”

The task force’s ﬁrst objective, as
stated by their plan found on the W&L
website is to “clarify and reﬁne the plan
for ﬁrst year residential life students.”

Next, as stated in the plan, the task
force will “analyze the current living
patterns of sophomores, juniors, and

seniors, including data on where they
live.”

Greek housing also falls into this cat-
egory. Evans said that it is an “important
part of the community,” but that “we
don’t have any preconceived notions as
to how it is going to ﬁt in. We want to
make sure we are providing opportuni-
ties and options for all of our students,
Greek and non-Greek."

After reviewing everything and col-

lecting all of the data, the task force
will then submit their recommendations
to the president to be reviewed by the
Board of Trustees.

While all ofthese tasks are important
to the future aspects ofimproving social
and residential life, the options for im-
provement must always be reasonable
ﬁnancially. Whenever one decides to
go about renovation it is going to cost
money, and there are limits to what can

dential life

be done.

Although it’s still early in the pro-
cess, Dean Evans said a preliminary re-
port will be ready for consideration by
the end of the academic year.

Said Evans: “We are trying to look
at ﬁrst-year housing ﬁrst...you want to
make sure the housing is safe. You want
to make sure that the housing supports
our programming efforts. You want to
have housing that students like.”

Fighting for cancelled classes

Law student is petition calls for a day 0]?’ of school in observance of Marti

By Kelsy McCraw
C o P Y E D ITO R
A petition is circulating among law
students for Washington and Lee ‘Uni-
versity to even more formally recognize
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.

The petition, crafted by David

I Knoespel ‘ 14L, requests that W&L can-

cel classes every third Monday of Janu-

, ary to “honor the principles that Dr. King

championed.”

' “Ceasing classes on MLK Day
would give us a formal occasion to think
about what MLK’s policies mean to us
as a community, (and as) individuals,”
Knoespel wrote on the petition. “While
some would surely use the day for other
purposes, others could use it for discus-
sion, self-reﬁection, or mere apprecia-
tion of how far we have come and how
far we still need to go.”

Knoespel said he created the petition
on change.org, an online petition plat-
form, after law school orientation, dur-
ing which he and his fellow I-L students
learned they would not get the national
holiday off. Knoespel started the petition
as a means to instigate discussion about
the issue. '

“It’s a very personal issue to a lot of
people, not just important to the students
of color, and I think that Martin Luther
King is the type of person we really
should celebrate here at Washington and
Lee,” he said in an interview. “He was a
public servant who stood for honor and
died forjustice.”

Since its creation about three weeks
ago, the petition has garnered over 124
signatures. Knoespel says that even more
law students and faculty have expressed
their support for it, though they declined
to put their name on an ofﬁcial petition.

One signee, identiﬁed as Koral Fus-
selman ‘IZL, wrote on the petition’s
webpage, “Not only is it offensive that
we don’t honor or celebrate this man and
his accomplishments, it is APPALLING
that we celebrate Robert E. Lee’s birth-

Famous billboard subjects coming to Washington and Lee to talk about body image

By Leigh Dannhauser
STA F F wmre R

Stacy Nadeau, a member of the
Dove’s Real Women advertisement
campaign, is coming to Washington and
Lee to speak about the messages that
young women receive about body im-
age.

On her page on the website Cam-
pusSpeak, Nadeau said the number of
women who like the way they look is
very low. .

“A Harvard study revealed that only
2-percent of American women felt com-
fortable calling themselves beautiful,”
Nadeau said.

In 2005, Dove began using their ad-
vertisements in an effort to change those
kind of-statistics. They use “real women
with real curves” to change people’s
views on beauty. ‘

Dove’s mission is “to make more

day [three days before]. The contrast
could not be more striking. I am morti-
ﬁed yearly when I explain to friends and
family throughout the country how W&L
conducts itself at this time of year...”
Knoespel, who is from Charlotte,
N.C. and received his undergraduate
degree from the University of North
Carolina in Chapel Hill, agreed that not

W&L, Liberty University, and the Uni-

ceasing classes on MLK, Jr. Day might
portray the University in an unintention-
ally negative way.

“My friends and family (outside of
W&L) are shocked when they hear we
don’t get classes off. Their jaws drop,”
he said. “The school certainly isn’t tum-
ing a blind eye to the issue, but I think
it might be hurting itself in its efforts to
attract diverse teachers and students.”

Currently, W&L celebrates MLK,
Jr. Day with a keynote address on the
night of the holiday, a community ser-
vice project, and a birthday party in El-
rod Commons for the children of Rock-
bridge County.

Last year, the former UN ambassa-
dor and personal friend of King, Andrew
Young was the keynote speaker.

The University maintains a normal
class schedule on the holiday.

Of Forbe’s 2011 Top 50 American
Colleges, of which W&L is ranked 25th,
only six other schools do not suspend or
cancel classes for MLK, Jr. Day. Many
of the Top 50 schools do not start their
spring semesters until after the holiday.

Knoespel started the petition speciﬁ-

women feel beautiful every day by wid-
ening the stereotypical theme of beauty
and by inspiring women to take great
care ofthemselves”.

Nadeau’s speech, titled “Embracing
Real Beauty,” will be about Nadeau’s
experiences in the campaign rather than
about eating disorders.

Teri Cugliari, associate director of
student activities and greek life, is ex-
cited for Nadeau’s appearance.

“[It is going to be] really good to
bring a normal looking person who’s
never had an eating disorder and talk
about her experience” says Cugliari.

ule to accommodate MLK, Jr. Day pro-
grams, but that low attendance prompted
the law faculty to reinstate a full day of
classes. Her main concern is that stu-
dents would not use a day off from class-
es for MLK, Jr. Day appropriately.

“Before we can move to more dras-
tic measures, students need to show that
they appreciate the programming that is
already available to them,” she said.

Futrell said current undergraduate
programming has low student atten-
dance, and that faculty and members of
the Lexington community constitute the
vast majority of the participants.

“Unless it can be a productive day,
the students will not beneﬁt from a day
off from classes,” she said.

In an email, Interim Provost Roger
Strong explained that not. cancelling
classes on MLK, Jr. Day equals how the
University handles other national holi-
days.

“We do not cancel classes for Martin
Luther King, Jr. Day. But we do not can-
cel classes for other national holidays,”
he said. “We do orientation and academ-
ic advising on Labor Day. We have class

on President’s Day unless it falls during
our regularly sche_duled [Washington]
break. There are other national holidays
on which we hold classes: Columbus
Day and Veterans Day immediately
come to mind.”

MLK, Jr. Day, which falls on January
16 in 2012, became an ofﬁcial national
holiday when Ronald Reagan signed it
into law in 1983, after King’s assassina-
tion in I968.

The state of Virginia ﬁrst incorpo-
rated it with Lee-Jackson Day to create
Lee-Jackson-King Day because of the
proximity ofthe three ﬁgures’ birthdays,
January I9, 21, and 15, respectively.

However, in 2000, the state legisla-
ture separated the two days because of
the incongruent messages between Lee-
Jackson Day and MLK, Jr. Day~the
celebration of two prominent Confeder-
ate generals, Robert E. Lee and Stone-
wall Jackson, and the celebration of a
prominent national ﬁgure in the Civil
Rights Movement ofthe ’60s who advo-
cated for equal legal and social rights for
all human beings.

Lee-Jackson Day falls on the second
Friday ofJanuary, just three days before
MLK, Jr. Day. The holiday will be cel-
ebrated on January 13 in 2012.

Virginia is the only state to recognize
Lee-Jackson Day as a state holiday.

In the past, the University has imple-
mented an adjusted class schedule for
the celebration of Founder’s Day every
January I9. The revised schedule ac-
commodates a mid-day convocation to
induct new members to Omicron Delta
Kappa, the National Leadership Honor
Society founded at W&L in 1914. The
convocation also spotlights a distin-
guished speaker on some aspect of the
University’s history. -»

Strong says that, while Lee was th
subject of last year’s speech, the topics
vary from year to year. He says that this

year’s speaker will be the author of a
new biography of George Washington,
the University’s other namesake.

The Stonewall Brigade Camp of the
city of Lexington, a fraternal organiza-
tion of male descendants of Confederate
soldiers, organizes the events honoring

_Lee-Jackson Day, including a memo-

rial service in honor Lee and Jackson,
who spent much of their post-war efforts
shaping W&L and Virginia Military In-
stitute, in Lee Chapel.

The celebrations of Lee-Jackson Day
are not afﬁliated with the University.
W&L allows for the use of Lee Chapel
for non-University functions when the
use does not compromise the site’s func-
tion as a University venue and public
museum, does not endanger the facilities
or exhibits and is consistent with good
community relations.

Still, Knoespel explained that Lee-
Jackson Day is an important part of the
history of Washington and Lee, and that
the two men stood for more than just the
Confederacy.

“I don‘t think the two days are so
diametrically opposed as all three men
stood for integrity and honor,” he said.
“I just think they should be celebrated on
the same scale.”

The faculty votes every year on the
academic calendar. If classes were dis-
missed for MLK, Jr. Day, they would
have to be made up somewhere else on
the calendar, though Knoespel has spo-
ken with a few school administrators
to propose an adjusted law school class
schedule on the day, or making up the
day by starting classes a day early or
dropping one exam day.

“I’m not intent on losing valuable
class time,” he said. “But the symbolic
value of the day is so much greater in
comparison.”

3 - THE RING‘-TUM PHI ~

 

opinions

 

  

In defense of resident advisers

Resident Advisor Stephanie Krasnov asks students to stop blaming their RAs and take responsibility for themselves

People of-
ten ask me why
I wanted to
be a Resident
Advisor. My
sarcastic retort
is simple: the
D-Hall frozen
yogurt. But
the true reason
is because my
freshman year
I r‘ was one of the

B Stephanie Krasnov best Years Of
COLUMNIST my. life and I
attribute that

partly to my RA.

Yes, I may have also had some awe-
some hall mates and been on the ﬁrst
co-ed hall in the school’s history, but my
ﬁrst year as a W&L student would not
have been quite as enjoyable if it weren’t
for my. RA. It is my goal to offer the

freshmen on my hall thatsame experi-
ence.

So when I hear that people are equat-
ing the RA staff to the “Lex-Po,” and that
we are being harassed at parties, I take it
personally. Our job here at W&L is not
to bust you guys or have you talk to the
Deans. Believe me, we have better things
to do with our time. Contrary to popular
belief, we are actually normal students
here, and surprise, surprise,.we go out to
parties too!

I’m sorry that if we walk by your
door at I a.m. and see a case of Natty
and SKYY Vodka on your dresser, we
are going to write you up. Just like in the
real world, there are rules that must be
followed and the handbook does a pretty
goodjob of outlining them.

I’m also sorry if you are blaring Mi-
chael Buble from your room in GL and
we kindly ask you to turn it down be-
cause people can hear it all the way in

Davis; some students here actually need
to sleep for their tests.

The RA reputation on campus is
formed in the same way that party gos-
sip is spread: you only hear the worst
or mostshocking stories from the night
before. I have never heard anyone in
the omelet line on Sunday whispering
about how their RA helped walk them

in their room because they know it was
dumb for them to buy liquor in the ﬁrst
place. It still bafﬂes me that freshmen
will go out of their way to obtain alcohol
when they could more easily walk to the
nearest frat house and have all the drinks
they want. =

I was blessed this year with a surpris-
ingly tame hall, whose loudest moments

I have never heard anyone in the omelet line on

Sunday whispering about how their RA helped walk
them home from Old House

home from Old House, or how they are I

so thankful that their RA took them to
the health center when they were puk-
ing their brains out in the toilet. You also
never hear them gossiping about how
much they are sorry for having alcohol

are when they are trying to kill the cock-
roaches they ﬁnd in the rooms. I have not
had to write any of my residents up or
even tell them to quiet down (knock on
wood), and I personally look at them as
my friends, rather than 18 and 19-year-

old kids I am supposed to keep out of
trouble. From what I have seen, they
are always smiling; except for when they
return from calc class, but that’s under-
standable.

At some point in time, we were all
ﬁrst years just like you are now, and so
we understand how much fun running
through the dorms at 3 a.m. is, and yes,
we like to order Domino’s after a party
too. But just be mindful of the few rules
we have, because the night you decide
to stay in and study, you will appreciate
it when we ask your hall mates to quiet
down.

So next time you hear someone com-
plaining about how they got a strike/inci-
dent, don’t jump in and continue to bash
the RAs. Maybe ask them exactly why
they got in trouble; their response will
probably explain it all.

Straight but not

you are an amazing swing-dancer. Af-
ter the band plays “September,” a rogue
swing-dancer crashes into you and you
lose the contents of your classy red solo
cup from the “cocktail party,” possibly
on the girl next to you. Beware of this,
people get aggressive when spilled on —
she might even comment that if you spill
on her again, “she will kick you in the
face” (shout out to the girl who said that
this weekend). You start to make your
way to the mountain of Natty Light boxes
in the back of the tent (this is obviously
not a cocktail party anymore, people) so
that you can have more liquid to spill on
those around you. After you have wres-
tled your way back to where your friends
are camped out on the dance floor (in
front of the band, obviously), you ﬁnally
ﬁnd your date...dancing with your best
friend. This is where this week’s video,
“Jackie and Debra,” by John Roberts,
comes into play.

We have all

' you homo.”

written down on
paper, yet many
consider this perfectly acceptable dia-
logue. Can young adults not realize the
absurdity of their language choices, let
alone the offense it can bring?

We often don’t think about our word
choices, calling things “retarded” or
“stupid” on a regular basis, because
who are we hurting? But the fact of the
matter is, those words are hurtful, and
are often interchanged, along with other
negative terms, for the word “gay.”

For the record, “Gay” does not mean
stupid. It does not mean dumb, lame,
ugly, boring, annoying or frustrating.
Just like “straight” does not mean smart,
pretty, cool or important. Gay means
gay, and that’s just ﬁne.

It is odd how a word which origi-
nated with such positive connotations:
lighthearted, carefree and brilliant, has
been turned into a word that is used to"
attribute negative characteristics to a
person or a thing.

Calling someone a “faggot”, which
pains me to even write in this article, is
wrong. It is the equivalent to calling a
black person the n-word, a Hispanic a
“spick” or a Jew a “kike” among many
other disgusting phrases for every eth-
nicity, religion and culture.

Most people would never even think
to use the last three words, yet the term
“faggot” has entered into mainstream
English, unacceptably accepted as part
of our language.

I am straight, so since I am not a
member of the LGBT community, I do
not really know what it is like for those
who are members on this campus. I do

, Ali Greenberg advises students to choose their words carefully

not know what they go through, or what
their experiences were growing up, so I
cannot speak for them.

But as an outsider, I wouldn’t call
W&L as a whole an extremely welcom-
ing community for LGBT students, al-
though I will give credit where credit is
due and say that I expected a lot worse
from such a conservative and southern
school. Again though, I have no person-
al experience to go off’of.

Whatl do know is that in the last few
years, suicides by LGBT youth have
been in the headlines nationwide. LGBT
youth are twice as likely as straight
youth to be victims of bullying at school
and four times more likely than straight
youth to attempt suicide.

Yet, in a time when we are making
more strides than ever in the accep-
tance of the LGBT community (repeal
of DADT, Gay marriage legalization in
many states, LADY GAGA), it is sad to
know that the LGBT youth are continu-
ously subjected to teasing and bullying
in American schools.

The “It Gets Better” project was
founded a few years ago as a means to
show all gay youth that while coming to
terms with who they are might be hard,
and coming out harder, it will get bet-
ter. Actors, athletes and musicians have
come together in support of the project
to record videos proclaiming the ‘‘It gets
better” message. '

Now many activists are asking for a

/‘ formal anti-bullying law, something that

would make it a criminal offense. While
I wouldn’t say bullying is an issue on
campus, it would be difﬁcult to say that
prejudices don’t come into play at times.
While we do not have anyone taking
ﬁrst-years lunch money in D-Hall, some
fraternities and sororities may discrimi-
nate against openly gay students by not
giving them bids or taking the chance to
get to know them as individuals.

I ﬁnd issue with the use of the term
“gay” as a deﬁnition of a person. While
it is obviously part of who they are, it is
an identiﬁer and not necessarily a deﬁn-
ing characteristic, and especially not the
deﬁning characteristic. A lawyer who
happens to be gay is not suddenly a “gay

_ son regardless of whether it started at

Jackie and Debra are besties who
are having a little trouble in paradise.
Debra demonstrates some interesting
techniques for hashing out this misun-
derstanding over what really happened
on the ski trip with Robbie Blackner (she
only had halfa sip ofa wine cooler peo-
plel). This video offers its viewers some

options as to how to handle this home-

coming drama.

I. Passive aggressively ignore. When
going with this option, you have to be
the friend who cares less. If you make
it look like you are having a better time
than your date-snatching friend, then you
obviously win. Later in the night when
she calls you and asks you to meet her
at the Traveller stop, you can ignore her
calls. “Oh look, it’s my ex-best friend

calling for the eighteen hun-
dredth time. I am not talking to you, but
I will text you and let you know that I am

lawyer,” they are just a lawyer.

There needs to be respect for every
individual regardless of their skin col-
or, sexual orientation, level of educa-
tion, religion or country of origin, just
to name a few.

Gay is not a lifestyle choice. It just
is. It just exists and is part of the per-

birth or developed later on in life. No
one wakes up one day and says, “Hello
Tuesday, it’s 85 and sunny, sounds like
a great day to be attracted to the same
sex!” Just like straight people don’t
make active decisions every week to
still be straight.

There should no longer be any de-
bate over whether being gay is right or
wrong. America needs to just let it be.
Let us all be with whomever we want
to be with as long as it is two consen-
sual adult humans.

And to quickly touch on the topic
of gay marriage, they should have every
right to get married and subsequently di-
vorced as any other American. Remem-
ber when interracial marriage was ille-
gal, before I967? That is how we will
look back on the gay marriage debate in
20 years. Complete and utter absurdity
and unconstitutional discrimination.

My message is this; think about
what you say, the words you use, and
how you treat others. Sexual orientation
does not deﬁne a person’s character, and
when you use the word “gay” with a
negative connotation in regards to your
homework, you may unintentionally be
offending those who are gay, or have
gay family or friends. There are more of
us around than you think.

  

not talking to you.”

2. Being overly-aggressive. This is
the opposite of our ﬁrst strategy. In this
situation, you act like your ﬁght is go-
ing to spark World War III and if it’s not
resolved before the band plays Cee Lo
Green’s classic “F *** You,” then the
world as we know it will end. When us-
ing this technique, Debra teaches us that
the best approach is to simply scream
your friend’s name over and over, getting
louder each time until they are forced to
acknowledge the fact that you are hov-
ering behind her and your date. At this
point, you grab her hand and pull her into
the nearest bathroom, where you overan-
alyze everything that has happened dur-
ing the night and what it means for your
friendship. By the end, things will have
gotten much worse or you will both be
crying and telling each other how much
you love each other as someone is vom-
iting in the stall next to you (remember,

this is a classy weekend).

3. One strategy that Debra fails to
mention, but is deﬁnitely a viable option
for W&L students, is to get over it and
ﬁnd someone else with whom to “swing
dance” (aka ﬂail your limbs drunkenly).
This is Red Square, people — you are
required to have a good time. So ﬁnd
another one of your friend’s dates (pref-
erably your date-snatching bestie’s) and
start the cycle over again.

*Note to the readers. Jackie and
Debra are an example of frenemies.
Real friends don’t steal each other ’s
dates... at least not without asking. And
they deﬁnitely don ’t get in ﬁghts over this
kind of stuff in the middle of a band party
where you are supposed to be dancing.
However, if by chance this situation
does arise, take some advice from Debra
in the area of conﬂict resolution. She
knows whats up.

First—Year Homecoming Impressions

Opinions editor Campbell Burr asks ﬁrst-year-students for a short and sweet description of their weekends

Freshman year homecoming week-
end is one of my best memories. I surfed
from cocktail party to cocktail party,
admiring the wide assortment of drink
optionsand bar snacks. The band par-
ties were a dream come true for a girl

who was raised off of disco music and
taught to swing dance with the same se-
riousness she was taught to read. I was
pleasantly surprised to ﬁnd that strong
dancing abilities seem to be an admis-
sion requirement for male students.

The only rough point of my fresh-
man homecoming weekend was when
my left heel became stuck in the strap
of my right shoe and I fell straight onto
my stomach in the middle of a fraternity

seconds, I lay in a puddle of beer, trying
to disentangle my shoes. When I ﬁnally
succeeded and got up, I saw alot of con-
cemed faces. Minus a little embarrass-
ment, a huge bruise on my knee, and a

some!

men are saying about their experiences!

Sittin down with Hoodie Allen

Do you know what his avorite sushi roll is? We do. We know you ’re jealous. (Its a crunchy, crab roll, in case you ’re wondering)

STAFF WRITER

Last Thursday, Chiddy Bang and Hoodie
Allen performed at the Pavilion for a Generals
Activity Board sponsored concert. Ring-tum
Phi managing editor Diandra Spicak and I had
a chance to sit down with opening-act Hoodie
Allen a few hours before the concert for a brief
Q&A session.

Ring-tum Phi: How did you get started in
music?

Hoodie Allen: l’ve been writing and record-
ing music since I was probably 12 or I3 years
old. It wasjust something I did all the time when
I was in high school and college and when I was
about to graduate from Penn, I did a song called
“You and I are Robot” that picked up some tracks
online.

Phi: I read that you had ajob at Google after
college though?

Allen: Yeah, I was really lucky to work there
when I did, but it felt like I was doing two full
timejobs at the same time. Music is something I

really loved to do and it got to the point where I
could see myself doing it and live off it full time.
And everything else isjust ajob.

Phi: How’d you get to perform at W&L?

Allen: Well I’m on a college tour right now,
west coast, east coast. It’s actually my first show
at a college in Virginia. Not UVA or VMI, but
W&L.

Phi: Best thing about performing?

Allen: I think the best thing is when people
are singing along and know all the _words to
something that I wrote. You know, they’ll sing
along and yell on top of their lungs. I think that’s
probably the best feeling while performing.

Phi: Worst thing about performing?

Allen: Just that all my clothes get drenched
after performing and I feel like a disgusting hu-
man being! That’s the only thing I can think of.

Phi: What are you working on now?

Allen: Well in July we released a mixtape
called “Leap Year” and that’s been getting
around. And we started already working on

'what’s probably another free tape and my ﬁrst
proper album. So that’s what's in the works now,
no timeline yet.

‘ Phi: Any favorite artists?

Allen: I’ve -been listening to the Jay-Z and
Kanye album a lot. Foster the People’s album is
pretty catchy, I like that. I’m not a big hip-hop
person. I like Frank Ocean. I think I gravitate to-
wards listening more to indie, pop-ish sounds. It
kind of comes through in the music I per.forrn-a
little bit.

Phi: Any one in particular that influences
you?

Allen: My favorite artist of all time is Andre
3000. I think he’s the shit. He can do everything,
rap and sing and is not afraid to go anywhere with
his music. I’ve always been a big fan of his.

Phi: Any other comments?

Allen: All my music’s free online on my
Facebook page. . . ‘and I think W&L is going to be
such a sick time.

 

 D—Hall features local foods

Last Wednesday, the Fall Harvest Dinner tantalized tastebuds for the ﬁfth year, focusing on foods from the area

By Cynthia Lam
STAFF WRITER

The delicious aroma of freshly-baked
bread, savory meats, and steaming hot
cider ﬁlled the air as hungry students,
faculty, and staff ushered in the begin-
ning of autumn with the Local Fall Har-
vest Dinner.

An array of dishes ﬁlled the Mar-
ketplace last Wednesday night, includ-
ing polenta lasagna, Yankee pot roast,
Greek salad, garden vegetables, and an-
gel hair pasta, along with desserts such
as pumpkin cheesecake bars, chocolate
beet cake, and vanilla ice cream.

All of these foods came from local
producers and providers within an 80-
mile radius ofthe school.

Marketplace Chef Geraldine Mc-

Cutcheon said, “This is the ﬁfth year
we’ve been doing the Fall Harvest Din-
ner and our goal is to celebrate the di-
versity of food that’s available in the 10-
cal market. W&L is very committed to
sustainability, and part of sustainability
is keeping the farming community here
vital by buying local.”

As part of this commitment, many of
the regional produce farmers and small
vendors work closely together with the
university to provide fresh, healthy, and
local food for the students. The beef
comes from Buffalo Creek Farm right
here in Lexington, Joe’s Pasta in Char-
lottesville provides past of course, and

Real friends

get ﬁt

Its the group exercise program ’s “Bring a
Friend Week” - tag along for free!

By Kelsey Cotter
STA F F W R I T E R

There’s no better time than this week
to try out Washington and Lee’s new
and improved group exercise schedule.
During the week of October 2nd through
October 8th the group exercise program
offers “Bring a Friend Week”.

Aubrey Shinoﬁeld, service-learning
coordinator, said that the program’s goal
is to get as many people involved as pos-
sible.

A one group exercise class costs $10,
but next week students have a chance
to join a friend for free who is already
committed to group exercise and see
how they like the workout.

Students who bring afriend can also
enter their name and their friends name
in a raffle to win a semester of ﬁtness
classes for free. The raffle sign up is lo-
cated in front of the studio on the fourth
floor of Doremus Gym.

Shinoﬁeld says the group exercise
program has introduced new classes to
provide a fuller schedule for busy stu-
dents.

“Some people say they don’t have
time to ﬁt a class into their day, but
we’ve expanded our range ofclasses and
our hours to accommodate students’ and
faculties’ schedules,” says Shinoﬁeld.

“We welcome feedback. We want
to know time that work best for your-
schedule and we will do our best to
make it happen,” says Shinoﬁeld.

The student teaching program is also
new this fall. The goal is to train a small
number of students in Pilates, spin, and
kickboxing. Shinoﬁeld believes in the
beneﬁts of having students teach classes
in order to spark motivation and excite-
ment in their piers.

Sophomore Emmy DiGiovanni
teaches Zumba classes on Sunday at
6:00 and Thursday at 7:00 in the dance
studio. Emmy bringsher own style into

the class by incorporating hip-hop music ’

into the traditional Latin music routine.

She uses songs and moves that her
students like in order to bring more life
to the class. “Zumba should feel like a
party. The more people the better!” said
DiGiovanni. She received her Zumba
certiﬁcation last February in North Car-
olina and continues to add to the pro-
gram.

Sophomore Sarah Strunk has taken
Emmy’s class and loves the environ-
ment. “It’s fun because one of your
friends is leading you. It’s not as intimi-
dating”, said Strunk.

lin County churns the milk.

The honey is gathered at Whistle
Creek Apiaries in Rockbridge Country,
and the tofu is made from soy beans at
the Twin Oaks Farm in Charlottesville.

All in all, over 30 percent ofthe food
used by W&L’s dining facilities is 10-
cal. This includes the chicken, ﬂour,
tomatoes, potatoes, yogurt, cheese, and
apples,just to name a few.

“The program has been very good for
the local businesses,” said McCutcheon,

“There’s a really good synergy between

the food that the university uses and
what farmers and processors have an
excess of.”

More importantly, she notes, this ex-

change helps protect the environment
and reduce the school’s carbon footprint.
“Farming is a very energy-intensive
business,” said McCutcheon, noting the
ecological costs of packing, shipping,
and storing produce. “If you’re buy-
ing local, all ofthese get out... the food
choices that you make really have an
impact.”

The difference is not only evident in
the environment, but also in the taste of
the food.

“There are lots of great things about
local apples... people pick them right
off trees. They’re not commercial,
so they’re not waxed or refrigerated,
they’re a lot fresher, a lot more sustain-

able, and of course, they’re delicious,”
added McCutcheon.

Students have noticed the difference
as well. First-year Victoria Blackstone
said, “You can deﬁnitely taste the dif-
ference between the organic and the
non-organic fruit. The local apples
have the blemishes on it, and it makes
it more real and it doesn’t taste so artiﬁ-
cial, whereas the apples that aren’t local
are shiny and crisp, and they’re creepily
perfect, but they aren’t apples. I prefer
the local apples.”

- THE RING-TUM PHI-

MONDAY,

 

ALEXANIDIER iVIAl{AGOS

For 18 weeks and four days, football fans suffered the daily
unrest that lingered for the duration of the NFL Lockout. It re-
ally seems like forever ago that I went to church every Sunday
and prayed that at some point during the next week, the lockout
would be miraculously lifted. The owners and players eventually
put away their differences (and answered my prayers) without the
schedule or the league-wide fan base taking much of a hit.

OCTOBER 3, 2011

sports

S'l‘EPHE1 I PECK

This NBA lockout is, simply put, a disaster. The handful
of owners who believe that the best way to run a franchise is
to give blank checks to mediocre free agents are completely
at fault. That issue is at the very cmx of the lockout: ‘players
are vastly overpaid and owners are inexplicably losing money
even when the sport is at the height of its popularity.

It is not the players’ fault that they are overpaid. That is

Now, with that lockout over and another one in full swing, I can
honestly say that any angst over whether or not the NBA season
will occur has nearly disappeared. It’s not like I have a “Care Me-
ter” when it comes to lockouts-—because sports are about breaking
those loyalty boundaries. However, I’m not going to lie to myself
day after day believing that a huge chunk of my life will be miss-

Stephen and Alex hash out this Week’s_
question: Who stands to lose the most if the
NBA season is canceled?

Alex says the organizations while Stephen
thinks it will be the layers.

simply the byproduct of what happens when savvy agents
and business-illiterate general managers come together to cut
deals. Rashard Lewis had the best quote on the matter in a re-
cent Washington Post story: “You sign me to a deal, you think
I’m going to say, ‘No, I deserve $50 [million] instead of $80
[million]? I’m like, ‘Hell, yeah.’ I’m not going to turn it down.
You can’t blame the players. If anything, we don’t negotiate

ing if the NBA does, in fact, cancel a signiﬁcant amount of regular
season play.

-I saw a tweet a few days ago that sums up my feelings perfectly, “My #NBA lockout indiffer-
ence has reached an all-time high. There seems to be no ceiling to it either” (via @ZWMartin). It
might be sad, but I continuously surprise myself with how much I don’t care about this situation
that seems to be spiraling to lower depths.

Now, I might not have had a lot of interest to lose to begin with, but there are many people/
things, that could be The Biggest Loser when all is said and done around Thanksgiving/Christmas/
Valentine’s Day (does anybody really know?).

My vote for who loses the most would be the group of mid to small market teams like Okla-
homa City, Utah, Golden State, Phoenix and Minnesota, among others. Those teams rely on the
inﬂux of casual fans to their stadium. They don’t have the consistent fan bases that the Lakers,
Bulls, Celtics and many others enjoy. The smaller fan bases have a short attention span, so it’s
imperative that their teams remind them how good (and therefore relevant) they are.

No time isa good time for a lockout, but the NBA lockout truly comes at a terrible time for
the league.

All eyes were on the NBA for a majority of last summer, as the most talented free-agent class
in league history chose new homes. Every day, fans were bombarded with constant updates about
what those free-agents were thinking, where they were visiting, what they were eating, what they
were drinking and what their favorite color is.

players. As we all know, three of the most talented players on the market decided to play together
in Miami (and subsequently sabotage a good amount of their positive public image), which created
lots of buzz around the league as to who had the best chance of knocking off the newly formed
juggernaut in South Beach.

As a result, many of the eyes that were following the summer roster—shufﬂing remained glued
to the NBA in the fall and winter. The 2010-2011 season was as exciting as any in recent memory
thanks to a deep group of talented young players (particularly guards) and a suspense-ﬁlled post-
season.

When Oklahoma City played Memphis in last year’s Western Conference semi-ﬁnals, fans got
to watch two young and talented teams - whose combined payroll was less than the Lakers’ alone.
Whether either team gained a signiﬁcant portion of fans after that heart-stopping series is yet to
be known; however, if those fans lose interest in the teams because of the lockout, then the ef-
fect - both ﬁnancial and psychological - of any new fans likely won’t be felt by the organizations.

This ordeal may not matter for the Lakers, who outspent every other NBA team by $17 million
lastiyear and have a fervent fan base, but it will kill teams like Oklahoma City, who aren’t as likely
to throw around money that isn’t usually there and are less flexible in ﬁnancial discussions.

After the 2010-2011 season the NBA had fans that weren’t usually there~now they might be
gone too.

What’s your ta e?

The NBA received almost endless positive publicity, all thanks to a handful of very talented)

the deal. We’ve got agents that negotiate the deals with the
team. Y’a1l need to go talk to the teams and the agents.”

Owners are ﬁnally realizing that the current system of ridiculous overspending is not
sustainable. And unfortunately, the owners will come out ofthis lockoutjust ﬁne having not
had to pay for signing so many ill-advised deals. It will be the players that have the most to
lose ifthe season is lost. _

Look at some of these mind-blowing contracts that will be slashed dramatically if the
season is lost: Chauncey Billups is set to make $14.2 million next year; Travis Outlaw(!),
$7 million; Richard Hamilton, $12.5 million; Mehmet Okur, $11 million. And perhaps most
egregiously, Gilbert Arenas is supposed to make $19 million this season (to put that into
perspective, he makes six million dollars more per year than Kevin Durant). There are doz-
ens more of these contracts out there, and instead of the owners being punished for signing
these deals, the players will be the ones seeing their money disappear. V

Now the players won’t be the biggest losers just because their wallets will get lighter.
From a basketball sense, a lost season hurts everyone from rookies to veterans. Think about
rookies for a second. Because of the lockout, this new draft class couldn’t play in the NBA
summer league, (it was canceled), they can’t practice at team facilities or can’t contact
coaches, they aren’t being paid, and they will lose a valuable ﬁrst year of playing experi-
ence. Kyrie Irving might have wanted to stay in school.

Aging stars will also be devastated if the 201 1-12 season is torpedoed. Tim Duncan is 35
years old and not gettingtany younger, We may have seen the last of legendary point guards
Jason Kidd and Steve Nash who are 38 and 37, respectively. Boston’s trio of Kevin Garnett
(36), Ray Allen (37), and Paul Pierce (35) may see their championship window slam shut
if there is no basketball this year. And the peerless Kobe Bryant and his decomposing knee
cannot afford to lose another chance at a title if he ever wants to tie Michael’s six rings.

Every player will lose ifthere is no season. But the player who stands to lose the most?
That’s easy.

LeBron James.

If there is no NBA basketball this year, “King” James will be two years through his
4-year contract at Miami and still without a ring. He will have to wait until the 2012-13
season to make people forget his epic choke in last year’s Finals versus the Mavericks.
He will have to live with being the guy who took the easy way out and became the Robin
to D-Wade’s Batman in an effort to win a handful of easy championships, and failed, for
another year.

Everyone loses if the season is canceled, from the fans to the owners. LeBron and the
rest of the players will first lose more than most. ‘

The Generals take advantage of late penalties by Randolph to tie the game and win 2-1 in overtime

A penalty-meltdown by Randolph
College in the ﬁnal 30 seconds of Wash-
ington and Lee’s men’s soccer game
Saturday turned an impending 1-0 W&L
loss into a 2-1 W&L win in overtime.

Following a comer kick by sopho-
more defender Zach Clarke with half
of a minute left in the game, three Ran-
dolph players received a red card and
two yellow cards after a scuﬁle broke
out in the Randolph box. The red card
gave the Generals an automatic penalty
kick, which junior defender Conor Starr
connected on to tie the game at 1-1 as
time ran out.

ing into overtime, the Generals scored
the winning goal in the 98th minute.
Sophomore midﬁelder Parker Wolﬁnger
beat the Wildcat keeper one-on-one to
put W&L on top.

The win improve W&L’s record to
4-4-1 overall and 2-2-1 in ODAC con-
ference play.

Neither team netted a score in the ﬁrst
half of the match, and only nine total
shots had been taken, four by the Gener-
als and ﬁve by the Wildcats. Randolph
held a strong advantage in corner kicks,
taking three while W&L had none.

The Wildcats got on the board at the
58:21 mark, but W&L came on strong
in the ﬁnal ﬁve minutes of regulation,
registering two shots and three comer
kicks. It was the ﬁnal comer kick that
eventually led to the W&L penalty shot.

The Generals ended the game with 12
shots to the Wildcats’ 11, but had only
ﬁve comer kicks, one fewer than Ran-
dolph. Senior keeper Ben Petitto spent
the entire game in the net, accounting
for two saves.

A game at F errum earlier in the week

resulted in another W&L win, 3-2, but

opposite fashion, scoring heavily in the

ﬁrst half and holding on for the win
through the second.

Ferrum scored ﬁrst, connecting on a
penalty kick only 13 minutes into play,
but the Generals responded with fervor,
recording three unanswered goals to go
into the break up 3-1.

A comer kick in the 27th minute set
up W&L’s ﬁrst goal, made by senior
midﬁelder Connor Pierce after a shot
by sophomore midﬁelder Alex Zelinski
was blocked. Two minutes later, junior
defender Basti Richter netted a header
off an assist from sophomore defender
Brendan Farley.

Zelinski made up for his earlier
blocked shot in the 44th minute to add
to the Generals lead.

The Panthers closed the gap in the
73rd minute but the General’s defense
held strong to preserve the win. Petitto
shared the net with ﬁrst year Albert
Civitorese, each recording a save and
Petitto earning the win.

The Generals will be back on the
ﬁeld Wednesday to host Southern Vir-
ginia at 4:00 p.m.

Shutout number nine

ODA C foes have yet to score on the Gennies, who have given up only one goal this season

By Angela Williams
5 TA F F w R I T E R

Washington and Lee’s women’s soccer
team remains undefeated in conference play
after winning 8-0 at Sweet Briar on Saturday,
improving to 4-0-1 in ODAC play and 8-1-1
on the season. Amazingly, the Generals have
given up only one shot this the entire season,
outscoring their opponents 44-1 through ten
games.

Seven different players accounted for the
Generals’ goals, with two coming from ﬁrst-
year midﬁelder Holley Beasley.

Beasley was the ﬁrst to score, netting a
ball only eight minutes into play. First-year
defender Emily Scott put in another score a
little more than four minutes later, and Beas-
ley put in her second goal about ten minutes
later at the 21:32 mark.

With a comfortable 3-0 lead less than a
quarter of the way into the match, the Gen-
erals continued pressing. A third ﬁrst-year,
forward Julia Lancaster, scored in the 31st
minute and senior midﬁelder Allie Espina ﬁn-

 

ished off the ﬁrst half with a goal in the 36th other dominating win as‘ the team took down

 

minute, giving W&L a 5-0 lead going into the
break.

The second half was more of the same.
First-year midﬁelders Katie Rossi and Lauren
Williams each netted the ball, in the 57th min-
ute and 61st minute, respectively, and junior
defender Alex Todd ﬁnished off scoring with
22 minutes left to play.

In addition,to her two goals, Beasley also
recorded an assist while Rossi contributed
three assists to complement her score.

The Generals were as dominating as the
ﬁnal score indicates. Senior Emily Leary
played the entire game in the net without fac-
ing a single shot. In comparison, SBC keeper
Seanne Weekes also played all 90 minutes
and recorded 18 saves. In all, the Gener-
als shot a total 44 times without the Vixens
shooting once.

The win over Randolph marked Leary’s
ninth shutout of the season.

The day before, the women had posted an-

Southern Virginia University 6-0 in Lexing-
ton.

First-years Katherine Rush, defender, and
Madeline F orrestel, forward, each made two
goals while Todd and Lancaster contributed
one each to ﬁnish out the game.

Rush scored ﬁrst, taking a rebound off the
SVU keeper not even ﬁve minutes into the
game. Forrestel put in her ﬁrst shot a little
more than ten minutes later off an assist from
senior midﬁelder Dory Blackey. Rush scored
again in the 29th minute to take the Generals
into the break with a 3-0 lead.

Ten minutes into the second half, Forrestel
added her second goal, and with 23 minutes
left to play, Todd put the Generals further up.
Lancaster ﬁnished up scoring with a goal in
the 88th ‘minute.

Leary recorded one save while playing the
entire game in the net.

The Generals will play again on Tuesday
when they travel to Hollins for a 4:00 pm con-
test.

istorical Homecoming

W&L football put up a score that hasn ’t been seen in over 60 years, winning 63-0

By Jayna Johns
SPORTS EDlTOR

The Washington and Lee football team
welcomed alumni back for Homecoming in
a big way, trouncing on Guilford on its way
to a 63-0 blow-out, the largest margin of vic-
tory since 1922 and the most points scored in
nearly 61 years.

The last time a Washington and Lee foot-

ball team scored more points in a game was -

against Richmond in 1950, which the Gen-
erals won 67-7. The Gennies ﬁnished that
season with a trip to the Gator bowl (where
they lost 20-7 to Wyoming) and ranked 18th
nationally in the ﬁnal AP and UPI polls, right
behind Nebraska in the AP and"A1abama in
the UPI.

While the football program at W&L has
clearly changed since that year, Saturday’s
win is nevertheless signiﬁcant for the pro-
gram. After posting an undefeated conference
record for the ﬁrst time in program history last
year, the Generals opened up conference play
for this season in promising fashion.

W&L kicked-off to start the game, but
were able to capitalize when Guilford fumbled
on the ﬁrst play of the game. Three plays later,
senior quarterback Charlie Westfal found the
end zone on a 13 yard run to put the team up
7-0 only 1:01 into the game.

Junior running back Luke Heinsohn was

on ﬁre, as he ran the ball in for a touchdown
on each of the Generals’ ensuring drives, the
ﬁrst run from three yards out and the second
from 23 yards, to put them up 21-0 after only
4:45 ofplaying time.

The Generals tacked on four more touch-
downs in the second quarter alone. A minute
and a half into the quarter, Westfal connected

with senior wide receiver Russell Stewart on a,

34-yard touchdown pass. Less than four min-
utes later, Westfal again found the end zone on
a one-yard run.

With just over seven minutes to play,
Heinsohn took off on his third touchdown run
of the day, this one coming from 63 yards out
and moving W&L’s lead to 42-0. Junior run-
ning back Brett Murray ﬁnished up scoring
for the ﬁrst half with a four-yard run with only
ﬁve seconds remaining on the clock to send
the Generals into the break with a 49-0 lead.

The team took its foot off the pedal for the
second half, but still managed a touchdown in
each of the ﬁnal quarters. Heinsohn scored his
fourth — a career high — and ﬁnal touchdown
of the game in the third on a two-yard run,
and ﬁrst-year running back Christian Croft
ﬁnished up scoring for the Generals with a
ﬁve-yard nm.

W&L outgained Guilford 535 yards to 190

s orts u date 

   

10/01 4th of 14

yards on the way to the team’s third-straight
win over the Quakers.

Heinsohn ﬁnished with a season-high 167
yards on only 12 carries while Murray came
up with 85 yards on 11 carries. Westfal only
threw the ball three times but complete two of
them for a total of 71 yards and a touchdown.
Stewart was the receiver for each completed
pass.

Defensively, W&L was overwhelming,
allowing the Quakers to make only 11 ﬁrst
downs and complete ten of their 24 passing
attempts. Guilford converted only two of its
13 third downs while throwing four intercep-
tions. The Generals also forced and recovered
two fumbles.

Senior linebacker Rob Look led the team
with eight tackles, while junior defensive
back Jake Pelton ﬁnished with six tackles, an
interception and a fumble recovery. Sopho-
more defensive back Lee Peaseley, senior
linebacker Taylor Malone and junior defen-
sive lineman Greg Barton accounted for the
other interceptions.

Senior kicker Peter Alston was perfect all
day, going nine for nine on PATs.

The Generals will be back in action when
they travel to Emory & Henry on Saturday for
a 1:00 p.m. kickoff.

Remembering
R.E. Lee

Virginia Tech professor

commemorates Lee is life

By Tommy Kent
5 TA F F w R IT E R

In honor of Robert E. Lee, Dr. James 1. Robertson
Jr., Alumni Distinguished Professor of History Emeri-
tus at Virginia Tech, will give a lecture Monday titled
“Lee and the Mobilization ofVirginia Forces in 1861”
in Lee Chapel.

Robertson’s address will focus on both the sesqui-
centennial anniversary of the Civil War and the 141st
anniversary of Lee’s death, which occurred on Octo-
ber l2, 1870.

Linda Donald, the manager of Lee Chapel and mu-
seum, helped coordinate the address and planned for
the arrival of Dr. Robertson.

Donald said, “There are fewer and fewer Lee schol-
ars. For many years, Lee was an American icon. Over
the past 15 years, that has begun to change. He is not
viewed as highly as he once was.”

Lee was the 11th Presidentof Washington College
and accomplished a great deal. During his ﬁve year
term, Donald ‘said, Lee increased the student body
from 40 to 400 students, introduced the honor system,
started the speaking tradition, increased the faculty
ﬁve-fold, and ordered the construction of Lee Chapel
and Lee House.

Reﬁecting on Lee’s one rule, that every man must
be a gentleman, Donald said, “He required of himself
and others: discipline, honor, duty, and civility. If we
had a country that operated on those principles we
would have a different world to live in. He led by
example.”

Several students also thought about what remem-
bering Lee might mean.

“He brought the honor system to W&L‘ and the

. school wouldn’t be the same without it. We celebrate

and commemorate a lot of things here but Lee is prob-
ably the most important. I don’t know ifpeople really
understand the history of Lee,” said Weining Bai ’13.

“It is important to remember Robert E. Lee because
he embodies the honor and traditions that we hold in
high regard. By remembering him, we can make the
intangible idea of honor something concrete that plays
a real role in our lives,” said Cort Hammond ’ 15.

One student commented on how Lee might view
W&L today:

“He would be happy that the honor system is trea-
sured so highly. He would probably not be impressed
by the large consumption of spirituous liquors and the
way that some men treat women,” said Zan Reed ’ 15.

Donald commented on the legacy of Lee and
whether or not he would want to be remembered.

“I don’t think Lee would really care. He was a
pretty humble human being. I don’t think he ever
knew why he was held to such a high level. During his
last 5 years he created a legacy for himself,” she said.

In addition to the lecture, Dr. Robertson will have
a book signing for the October 18 release of his new
book entitled “The Untold Civil War”. Admission to
the lecture is free and open to the public.

Remarking on how Lee was viewed bystudents
during his days as President, Donald said, “Most stu-
dents wrote that he was demanding but also a father
ﬁgure. You wanted to do better. You wanted to please
him. Hejust inspired people.”

Donald said that it was fairly common for small
private liberal arts schools to fail. She said, “If Lee
had not come here it is quite possible that the college
would not have survived.”

Student shares her 0- Week experience with the Lexington police department

By Kelly Mae Ross
5 TA F F w R IT E R

It was Orientation Week at Washington and Lee,
and that meant it was time for the annual O-Week
parties at Old House, the Lambda Chi Alpha off-
campus house located a few doors down from the
local police station.

It was a party night like any other for one W&L
junior, except shefd heard rumors that the police
had been busting more parties than usual lately and
arresting more students for alcohol-related offens-
es. This was in the back of her mind as she walked
down Washington Street towards Old House, the
music from the party becoming clearer and clearer.

The student got to the party, had a few drinks,
and was having a great time. Then the police
showed up and told all of the students inside not to
leave the house.

After about 30 minutes of waiting, ofﬁcers told
the students to exit the house single-ﬁle and load
onto the Traveller buses waiting outside.

This particular student, however, never made
it onto Traveller. Because she was underage and
drunk v as are many partygoers at W&L — she was
arrested and had to spend the night injail.

“I totally own up to the fact that I was doing
something illegal. I was drinking and I’m underage
— okay, ﬁne. But it was the way that they handled
it and their conduct, like how they were treating all
the kids, it was just absurd,” said the student, who
asked that her name not be used.

According to an article written by Courtney
Ridenhour and published in The Rockbridge Re-
port, 43 partying students were arrested during the
ﬁrst 19 days students were back in Lexington this
year, including O-Week.

The article said arrest numbers from the ﬁrst 19
days of last year were not available, but “only 65
students were charged for similar violations the en- -
tire calendar year.”

Members of the campus community have taken
notice of this string of arrests, including Woodie
Hillyard, president of the W&L Interfratemity
Council.

“After all of the interactions with the local
law enforcement during the ﬁrst week I felt like it
would be a good idea to meet with them, and I’m
trying to form more of an ongoing relationship with
them,” said Hillyard.

The higher number of arrests was a topic ad-
dressed speciﬁcally at the IFC’s Sept. 19 meeting,
according to the meeting minutes. The minutes
state that Dean Sidney Evans has scheduled week-

ly meetings with the local chief of police. Hillyard
will also be having regular meetings with local law
enforcement ofﬁcials. i

The Ofﬁce of Student Affairs, the IFC and the
Student Judicial Council are all taking steps to cre-
ate a more open line of communication between
students and law enforcement. '

Hillyard said the police have expressed willing-
ness to come talk to members of each fraternity, but
it is up to the presidents to establish contact with
the police and schedule a time for a meeting.

A mandatory meeting was recently held in Lee
Chapel where members of the local police and
sheriff’s oﬁice spoke to ﬁrst-year students about
rules and expectations. SIC Chair Matt Simpson
also spoke at the meeting.

Sarah Scaﬁidi, a ﬁrst-year student who attended
the meeting, said, “[The members ofthe police de-
partment and sheriff’s ofﬁce] were just trying to
emphasize that this year because they’ve been out
more we tend to think that they’re out to get us but
they’re really not~they’rejust here to protect us.”

Scaﬁidi said that the atmosphere ofthe meeting
was “pretty relaxed.”

At one point someone asked all of the students
in attendance that were 21 or older to raise their
hands. The only one who raised his hand was
Simpson, proving the point that almost everyone
in the chapel at that time was under the legal drink-
ing age.

“They said they were going to treat us like
adults and they want us to respect them as well,"
said Scafﬁdi.

Both students and law enforcement ofﬁcials
have mentioned a lack of respect as something that
is fueling the tension in the two groups relationship
with each other.

According to the article from The Rockbridge
Report, local law enforcement officials and W&L’s
director of public safety agree that there has been
more disrespect by students towards ofﬁcers this
year than there has been in the past.

Hillyard said that most of the students he talks
to tend to deny allegations of disrespect, but that
doesn’t mean the issue isn’t a concern for him.

“I really would love to get more interaction be-
tween the police and students because if they can
get to know us in a sober environment they’ll know
that we’re all respectful people and they’ll think
twice about arresting a student if they know that
there are some great students at W&L,” said Hill-

yard.

Hillyard also said that he became a bit more
skeptical of some of the O-Week horror stories he
has heard after meeting with Police Captain A.M.
“Bucky” Miller. Hillyard said Miller has been in
Lexington for a long time and he knows “how the
system works” with students, partying and the po-
lice.

Both Hillyard and the student who was recently
arrested at Old House have ideas for improving the
relationship between the police and W&L students.

The IFC is making a big push this term to en-
courage fraternities to hold more of their parties in
town (as opposed to in the country), said Hillyard.

But the recently arrested student said that she
believes that an increase in arrests by police will
lead to students wanting to party farther away from
town, which means farther away from the police.

“People are going to want to get out to the coun-
try. And that could be even more dangerous, like
going out there and you don’t have a ride and then
are people going to drink and drive more?” she
said.

Moving parties back into town and encourag-
ing fraternities to meet with members of local law
enforcement are steps that the IFC and the Ofﬁce of
Student Affairs are supporting, but there is a bigger
initiative that Hillyard said students should keep in
mind when they decide to go out.

“I think the average student just kind of needs
to live up to the expectations set forth by being a
member of our school. Be respectful. Carry your-
self as a lady or a gentleman. I think if we all kind
of followed that, that relationship will improve a
lot,” he said.

As for the student who was arrested at Old
House during O-Week, she is still in the midst of
sorting out just what her punishment will be. The
school placed her on 52 weeks of academic pro-
bation, ﬁned her $100 and had her take the online
AlcoholEdu course again.

She has a court date later this month, and she
hopes that the judge will allow her to participate
in something called the First Offender Program,
which would ultimately erase this underage drink-
ing charge from her record after a completion of
community service hours and a probation period.

“There have to be improvements,” said the ar-
rested student. “I know what I did was wrong 
but I think there [are] issues on both sides.”

Simpson remembered

Passing of art professor reminds students of her effect on Washington and Lee

By John Paul Beall
STAFF WRITER

As the ﬁrst female professor at Washington and
Lee, Professor Pamela Simpson had a lot of obsta-
cles to overcome.

According to Professor George Bent, Art De-
partment Chair, Simpson had no women’s bath-
room in the building where she worked. She was
one of the ﬁrst faculty member that had to balance
raising children with teaching.

But Simpson overcame and stuck with W&L for
almost 40 years.

By the time W&L went co-ed in 1984-1985,
Simpson had been here for 11 years, received ten-
ure, chaired the Art Department and served as the
Assistant Dean of the College. She was the ﬁrst
woman to do each.

As Associate Dean, she was charged with chair-
ing the Coeducation Committee, the body that con-
sidered and implemented all the changes that need-
ed to be made in order to accept women to W&L.
This included changes in curriculum like how to
include female vocalists in choir, women’s athlet-
ics, student life, parties, theater and music, extra-
curricular activities, infrastructure for all academic
buildings, dorms and sororities.

“Every woman on our campus today owes a
debt of gratitude to Pam Simpson,” Bent said.

Simpson was also active in the community. She
chaired the Lexington Historical Society, and was
a board member of Project Horizon and an active
member in the Rockbridge Chapter of NOW, the

National Organization for Women. She was an ac-
tive historic preservationist, even for communities
she had never seen.

In art department, Simpson played an integral
part in building up the departments for the arts,
Bent said. He called Wilson Hall and the Lenfest
Center “the house that Pam built.”

One of the programs Simpson spearheaded cel-
ebrated its thirtieth anniversary this year. Simpson
helped found and coordinate the Virginia Program
at Oxford, which sends students from six Virginia
colleges to England every summer.

Although Simpson’s illness prevented her from
attending that program’s celebration, she didn’t let
her cancer stop her academic career. She was teach-
ing three classes this term with the assistance of a
grad student even though, according to Professor
Ted Delaney, she did not expect to live past the end
of the year.

In addition to all she was doing here on campus,
she continued her work with her charities. When
she celebrated her 65th birthday this September,
she asked that her friends make a donation to one
of the charities she supported.

Delaney said, “There must have been half of
Lexington there at the party.”

Simpson kept her ties strong with both past and
present students. lane Lee Forster, one of the first
female generals, said Simpson was like a mother to
her and she was one of the reasons that she and her

family decided to move back to Lexington.

At this fall’s convocation, Simpson took the op-
portunity to speak and deliver a little more moth-
erly advice to the W&L community.

Though she could not stand for prolonged peri-
ods of time, she wanted to deliver her convocation
speech“Reﬁections on White Columns” so badly
that she sat on a stool at the podium rather than
decline to participate.

She told the students and professors there:-

“What can we learn from all this? One lesson is
that what we so value today came together over a
period of several hundred years. Each generation
built on the past. What resulted was not only a col-
lection of historic, distinguished buildings, (which
we are now working hard to restore) we also ended
up with a symbol. This is who we are. When we
think of our most deeply held value's~—academic
excellence, collegiality, civility, and most of all,
honor, all of them are embodied here.

...We might take our lesson from the Univer-
sity motto that while not unmindful of the future,
we also are also not unmindful of our past. You
stand on the shoulders of giants as well as ordinary
people and as you begin this academic year, you
should think about your role in continuing and con-
tributing to that legacy. What will you do in these
sacred spaces? How will you continue to shape its
meaning?”

Amanda Knox’s return to freedom

After four

_  years in an Ital-
‘  ian prison, twen-
ty-four year old
Seattle native
Amanda Knox
returned state-
, side on October
’  4th to the comin-
I‘ . gled cheers and
horror of all who

 

 

had followed

g the Meredith

"  ’ Kercher murder
Bymhewlelss trials. A brief

C D L U M N I S T
pI‘E3SS conference

took place upon Knox’s arrival, in which
she stated, “I’m really overwhelmed
right now. I was looking down from the
airplane, and it seemed like everything
wasn’t real.”

The grim reality of the past four years
tells the story of a girl who traveled to
Italy to study language. Amanda Knox
was a student at the University of Wash-
ington before she decided to attend the
University for Foreigners in Perugia for
one year. In September of 2007, Knox
moved into her new Italian apartment.
It was then that she met her new room-
mate, Meredith Kercher.

What happened next was what one
"might expect of a young woman study-
ing abroad. Knox became a waitress to

‘pay for her new Italian lifestyle. She

earned top grades. She became fast
friends with her roommate, and, while
attending a concert with Kercher, she
met a man named Raffaele Sollecito,
Meanwhile, as Knox began to spend
time with her new boyfriend, Kercher
started to associate with the men who
lived in the apartment beneath hers. A
friend of these men, Rudy Guede, took
an interest in Kercher. Guede had a his-
tory of breaking into private property
and had lately been doing so while armed
with a knife. What happened next would
begin the four-year long saga of how an

American student became involved in

one of the most publicized murder trials
of ourtime. '

On the night of November lst, 2007,
Meredith Kercher was at a friend’s
home, and Amanda Knox was supposed
to be working at Le Chic Pub. Twenty
minutes after eight o’clock, Amanda
received a message from her boss, Pat-
rick Lumumba, which excused her from
work that night. Shortly after she replied

to that text, Amanda turned her phone
off. Just before nine o’clock, Meredith
left her friend’s residence in order to re-
tire to her apartment, and Amanda was
spotted at Sollecito’s apartment. After
that, the fragmented facts point out that
Sollecito also turned his cell phone off
for the night, that Sollecito researched
bleach on his computer, that Rudy Guede
was in Kercher’s bedroom, and that, at
some point, the apartment belonging to
Kercher and Knox was ransacked and
one of the windows was shattered.

Returning home the next afternoon,
Amanda found the front .door of her
apartment open. She called Kercher, but
there was no answer. She walked around
for a bit, perusing the damage done to
the apartment. After an hour, Sollecito,
who was with Knox at the time, got
around to calling the police. When the
Carabinieri arrived, they found the pair
waiting outside of the apartment with a
mop and a bucket. Rudy Guede, it was
later discovered, had already boarded a
train to Germany.

Meredith Kercher’s body was found
beneath a bloody duvet in her bedroom.
Signs of struggle and sexual abuse were
present. She bore 47 injuries. Not sur-
prisingly, the ofﬁcial cause of death was
blood loss.

The next few days yielded an in-
tense period of investigation, the fruit of
which included a signed statement from
Knox that she had been at her apartment,
and had seen her boss, Lumumba, enter
Kercher’s bedroom. During that initial
questioning, Knox was high, and insist-
ed upon doing yoga in the interrogation
room. When one of the officers asked if
she could do _a cartwheel, she proved that
she could.

The next day, Knox changed her
mind, claiming that she had been abused
during interrogation and had made un-
true statements. The fact that she had
lied was later veriﬁed when an eyewit-
ness testiﬁed that Lumumba had been at
the pub all night. .

Knox’s next story was that she had
spent the entire night at Sollecito’s apart-
ment, smoking marijuana and sleeping.
For this reason, she couldn’t “fully re-
call” the events that took place that
night. Sollecito, acknowledging thatlhe
and Knox had been at his apartment that
night, admitted that it was possible that
Knox could have left the apartment that
night while he was asleep.

Meanwhile, Guede had left word
that he knew he would be a suspect, and
he had only left in order to make time
to clear his name. Before he could ac-
complish his task, however, he was ap-
prehended and extradited to Italy.

After his extradition, Guede testiﬁed
that he was at Kercher’s apartment on
the night of the murder, and that the two
had been having consensual sex. Later
that night, Amanda had come home,
and he had excused himself to go to the
bathroom. Kercher began to argue with
Amanda, claiming that Knox had sto-
len money from her. In order to avoid
listening to the argument, Guede turned
on his iPod, and continued to listen to
music until he heard a scream. When he

Allie Weiss describes how Amanda Knox is return to the United States has brought a mix of applause and horror

with the murder of Meredith Kercher,
as well as staging the break-in to cast
suspicion upon others. Knox received a
25 year sentence; Sollecito received a 26
year sentence.

In the months that followed, Knox
claims that she was sexually abused by
prison guards. This statement hasn’t
been met with much doubt, as Knox’s
beauty was a large part of what made
the trial so highly publicized. Journalist
Nina Burleigh asserts, “Our obsession
with female evil, our fascination with
the possibility of a depraved criminal
hiding behind a pretty face, drove the
coverage of this case, eliciting innuendo
as fact, and excluding at least half of the
narrative.” Indeed, Knox’s beauty isn’t

Some reporters have referred to the college student

as a sort of femme fatale, whose virtuous face masks

a more sinister personality. Others have painted her

as an angelic victim of circumstance, a lovely young

girl who was simply in the wrong place at the wrong

time.

 

ran to Kercher’s bedroom, he was struck
by an unidentiﬁed man, and fell. It was
then that Amanda and the man ran away.
After that, Kercher, who was bleeding
on her bedroom floor, tried to speak to
Guede. But, knowing he’d be suspect in
her murder, he ﬂed.

However, despite his argument that
he did not kill Kercher, Guede elected
for a Fast-Track trial, which allowed
an immediate decision to be made con-
cerning his guilt based on the evidence
provided at the time (Guede’s DNA
was found on Kercher’s body and pos-
sessions, and his bloody handprint was
found on her pillow). This kind oftrial is
reserved for those who, if found guilty,
will be entitled to a shorter sentence. He
was found guilty of the murder of Mer-
edith Kercher, and sentenced to 16 years
in prison.

Knox and Sollecito, meanwhile, de-
cided to undergo a standard trial. The
evidence against them included a knife
found at Sollecito’s apartment which had
Kercher’s DNA on the blade and Knox’s
DNA on the handle, Kercher’s bra clasp
which had Sollecito’s DNA on it, and
bloody footprints which were matched
to Knox and Sollecito that, authorities
discovered, had been scrubbed clean
(Luminol, a substance which reveals
bloodstains even after they have been
washed away, revealed the prints). In
October 2008, the couple was charged

something that has gone unnoticed by
the world. Some reporters have referred
to the college student as a sort of femme
fatale, whose virtuous face masks a more
sinister personality. Others have painted
her as an angelic victim of circumstance,
a lovely young girl who was simply in
the wrong place at the wrong time.

In fact, Knox’s looks were a key
player in her success at the appeals
courts. After U.S. DNA experts voiced
their skepticism and called for a reex-
amination of key evidence, Knox’s case
was reopened. Such facts were admit-
ted to seriously call into question the
strength of the DNA evidence. Some
of the evidence was not admitted until
a month after the murder, during which
time the crime scene was riddled with
investigators who weren’t always cau-
tious about contamination. According
to the New York Post, there were sev-
eral main -reasons for discarding the
evidence: the knife with Kercher’s and
Knox’s DNA contained such a miniscule
amount of DNA that it couldn’t deﬁni-
tively be matched to Kercher, Kercher’s
bra clasp had been admitted into evi-
dence too late for it to be viable, Knox’s
DNA hadn’t been located in Kercher’s
bedroom (though, in light of her having
been found with a bucket and a mop the
day after the murder, it might be perti-
nent to point out that her DNA hadn’t
been found in her own bedroom, either),

Looking for love

and the testimony produced from the ini-
tial interrogation had been the result of
physical abuse. But none of this amount-
ed to the deciding factor of one juror: “I
saw the faces of these two kids and they
couldn’t bluff. They didn’t bluff. My
point of view is that these kids weren’t
guilty.” Apparently, one look at Knox’s
face was all the juror needed to decide
that she would be acquitted that day.

After eleven hours of deliberations,
the jury ﬁnally released Amanda Knox.
Though the most recent examination
of DNA did not deﬁnitively exonerate
Knox, it weakened the evidence enough
to earn Knox her freedom.

Perhaps the truth about what hap-
pened that night will never become'pub-
lic knowledge. Authorities still suspect
that Guede had accomplices in killing
Meredith Kercher. The fact that Knox
has been cleared of all charges certainly
does not elicit forgiveness from those
who doubt her less-than-unchanging

tale. Nancy Grace reports, “I was very 

disturbed, because I think it is a huge
miscarriage of justice. I believe that
while Amanda Knox did not wield the
knife herself, I think that she was there,
with her boyfriend, and that hedid the
deed, and she egged him on.” Mean-
while, Burleigh disagrees, stating that
the only reason Knox was convicted in
the ﬁrst place was because of her “ap-
palling” treatment, and because of the
Italian court’s use of “evidence [that]
didn’t exist” which lead to the jury’s
“rubber-stamped conviction.”

Such speculation extends to Knox’s .

personal character. While her family is
quick to describe her as an honest per-
son and a dedicated student, her Italian
friends call her openly promiscuous and
drug-crazed. And though Knox’s school-
mates know her as the self-disciplined
vegan whose name was ever-present on
the dean’s list, Knox admits to having
had a bit ofa drug habit, even being high
on the night of the murder.

Now that Knox has returned home,
she states, “My family is the most im-
portant thing right now, and I just want '

to go and be with them.” In a later state— .

ment, her lawyer was heard saying, “We
are appreciative, thankful, and ever so
grateful to the appellate jurors for their
willingness to reopen and reexamine the
facts, to conduct a thorough and search-
ing inquiry into the true facts, which we
believe can only be characterized as pro-
foundly absent. It has been a trying and
grueling, nightmarish four-year mara-
thon that no child or parent should ever
have to endure.”

seeing each other regularly, after a ﬁght (she
treated him like, well, a gigolo. He didn’t like
that).

She kind of falls,.but doesn’t really let her-

balancing act of
chaying one’s

brains out and

in the sports
and other extra-

tivities, and life gets even more difﬁcult.

a prestigious job, and therefore he will
not be able to one day support the family

get. But does it necessarily have to be
that way? '

Like it or not, women are starting
to run shit. Look at Iceland: men ran
the government and the economy for
1,100 years and somehow bankrupted
the country from 2002-2008. Now the
mostly female Social Democrat party is
running the show, and by all accounts,
the lesbian Prime Minister, Johanna Sig-
uroardottir (yep, that’s her actual name),
is doing quite well running the country.
So while they are beginning to run shit
in the real world, they also run shit sta-
tistically. Women are proven to be better
managers of money than men (see: Ice-
land), and they have better SAT scores
across thecountry, not to mention a bet-
ter GPA on this campus. In other words,
the fairer sex is starting to look like the
superior sex.

So, what can we males do about this?

BySto-clcton Bullitt
cmumusr

We can either rely on our inherent su-
periority as males or we can embrace
it. The relying on our inherent superi-
ority worked for the first 35 years after
women got their “rights.” We still make
more money for doing the samethings,
and our sports matter more (unless you
are a diehard Minnesota Lynx fan). Not
only is that changing, but ever since the
2008 ﬁnancial collapse, it’s starting to
change more quickly. So, we’re left with
no decision other than to embrace these
smarter, more capable women.

Luckily enough, this rise of power-
ful women that will only keep growing
beneﬁts us college men in a direct way.
It gives us a way out.

Why worry about getting good
grades, a good job and supporting a sta-

games all day. I mean, when you look
at it, being a stay-at-home dad is just
pledgeship with cooking involved. You
need to sober drive the kids around, and,
as Louis CK. has already aptly pointed
out, toddlers act just like your drunk
friends. You need to clean the house and
make beds, which is much easier with-
out so many beer cans and features the
same proportions of throw up and poop
everywhere. And really, how hard can
cooking be? Just watch a couple hours of
the Food Network to cook for the wife,
and learn how to reheat chicken nuggets
and french fries for when the kids come
home. Boom. And that leaves multiple
hours for HBO and XBOX Live. Plus,
you don’t need to be embarrassed to tell
your friends about your livelihood be-

ble family, when you can just piggyback
off of someone who is already statisti-
cally more capable of doing so? That is
why I think that instead of getting your
B.A. or B.S. degree at Washington and
Lee, you should instead focus on what’s
more lucrative in the long run: getting
your M.R. degree. While you’re in col-
lege, just ﬁnd a woman who will support
you throughout your adult life, and you
are golden. This way, you can live the
sweet frat life for ﬁfty more years, and
all you need to suffer is the stigma of be-
ing a “stay-at-home dad.”

But is being a stay-at-home dad re-
ally all that bad? The strategy seems to
work for Will Amett in NBC’s new “Up
All Night.” All he does in that show is

cause all you need to do is use Fantasy
Football to give you job titles. You can
tell them that you are a trader (because
how else is Fred Jackson going to get
onto your team), an analyst (dissecting
three hours of watching “Fantasy Focus”
and reading Matthew Berry deﬁnitely
takes some analyzing) or in mergers
and acquisitions (what else would you
call the genius move of picking up Da-
vid Nelson on the waiver wire in Week
Two?).

But how do you go about ﬁnding and
holding onto the golden ticket that is
the SL1CC€SSﬁ.ll wife that you can piggy
back off of for decades‘? Well, I may not
know all the answers yet because 1 am
still doing plenty of research, but I do
have some quality answers to a couple

of questions you might be asking.

I. How do I get an heiress?

An heiress is a pretty bold move, but
if you have enough game, there might be
a future in it for you. First, you need to
ﬁnd out which girls are heiresses. First
start with the cars. If you see a BMW,
Lexus or Mercedes, you know that you
have a good chance of ﬁnding an heir-
ess. Don’t get distracted by ﬂashier
models because those might just be inse-
cure dads trying desperately to buy their
daughter’s love with a single purchase.
A BMW, Lexus or Mercedes shows that
the car purchase was just another in a
line of many. Next, look at the clothes. If
they come in Nieman Marcus bags only
and they all are made by names and not
companies (e.g. Ferragamo is a name,
Macy’s is a company), then you know
you are on the right path. Last, Google
her last name and “executive” and do
a little background research. If you get
enough hits, you know you have an heir-
ess.

After you know what you are looking
for, you will need to change majors to
a respectable C-School major, and start
dressing in outﬁts that could be featured
in a Brooks Brothers catalogue. After
that, all you need to do is to_ have the
heiress completely fall for your game,
and as long as you sufﬁciently impress
her father and don’t cheat, then you are
in the gold. Literally.

2. How do I get the girl with the most
future income?

Determining one’s future income
is always a hard task. It’s like picking
which horse will win the Triple Crown
next. But, you can help your task by tak-
ing a few economics classes and build-
ing up your own econometric equation
for future income of girls at W&L. If
that’s too much for you, just start at the
top of the honor roll and work your way

night, and missed a line during the last
show, butoverall I did ﬁne. I laughed a
lot, tried something new, and put myself
out there, despite my stage fright.

We all have fears, things we aren’t
good at, and things we want to try. We
only live once, so just go for it.

There is something to be said for
trying new things; writing articles was

‘ scary the ﬁrst few times aﬁer all. While I

have not found a new passion for acting
by any means, at least I can say that I
gave it a shot.

And if nothing else, it gave me an ex-

cuse to wear an absurd dress that was an F

Israeli impulse buy last December and
left me less 800 shekels.

down. The key with the future high net
worth girls is that they usually don’t
fall for conventional game techniques
because they spend your Windfall time
studying in the library or writing compli-
cated dissertations. So, you will need to
get them to fall into your trap using other
methods. Try using big words like “mi-
sogyny” or getting interested in things
like the Italian Renaissance. I know that
it’s not as fun as Sunday Night Football,
but it can certainly help you in the long
run.
3. What ifthe girl I’m with is f***ing
crazy?

Congratulations, you are not alone.
Stereotypes aren’t always true, but one
that I’ve ﬁnd most helpful in my life is
“Guys are stupid; girls are crazy.” That
is 100% true, and I challenge anyone
to prove me otherwise. Guys are stupid
enough to watch Spike TV; girls are cra-
zy enough to give Oprah her own tele-
vision network. Girls are crazy enough
to believe that “Bridesmaids” was actu-
ally funny, and guys are stupid enough
to give “The Expendables” a sequel. It’s
science.

So what do you do when you ﬁnd
out that your golden ticket is clinically
insane? Do what every other guy in the
history of mankind has done: appease,
appease, appease. If worse comes to
worst, always break out the “I’m sorry,”
or “You know, when you look ‘at it from
that way, you are completely right,” or
even, “You are clearly better than me/
her.” If that doesn’t work, just put your
head down sheepishly and nod while try-
ing to appear sony. And, if you follow
that up with an “Is that a new dress?” or
a “Wow, you look really great tonight,”
then you will get to hold onto that golden
ticket while playing “Gears of War” well
into your forties. Grades be damned.

Rockin’ out to support awareness

Student bands and artists ﬁll Davidson Park with music to educate others about sexual assault and help preventit

By James Biemiller
co P v E D I TO R

Even some alums came out to participate in
Rock Against Rape, spreading awareness abou
sexual assault and It's prevention on campus.

COY FERRELL / staff photographer °

Students willing to support sexual as-
sault awareness at W&L ﬁlled the Da-
vidson Park lawn Saturday afternoon at
the Rock Against Rape concert.

Rock Against Rape was ﬁrst orga-
nized two years ago by End It, a student
organization dedicated to raising aware-
ness about sexual assault and prevention
strategies.

End It grew out of a Women’s and
Gender Studies upper-level sexual as-
sault prevention seminar class two years
ago taught by Professor Melina Bell of

q the Philosophy Department.

End It participated in “consciousness
raising, publishing articles, putting up
posters, and spreading facts about the
statistical prevalence of 'sexual assault
on college campuses nationwide,” said
Bell.

End It member Eric Gehman ‘ l2 said
that the group “started writing regular
editorial letters to the Phi... and started
an anonymous stories project, where we
collected and published stories from as-
sault victims at W&L.”

The culmination ofthe sexual assault
prevention class was a concert, Rock
Against Rape, which brought together
student bands to raise awareness about
assault and to show that sexual assault is
an issue that both male and female stu-
dents care about.

Bell said that the concert helped show

that “men and women support sexual as-
sault prevention together, because it was
a joint effort between SigE’p and KEWL
(Knowledge Empowering Women Lead-
ers).”

“A lot of people think that sexual as-
sault is a battle ofthe sexes or a women’s
issue,” said Bell, “but most men never
sexually assault anybody...they are
more likely to be allies in preventing
rape.”

Junior End lt member and concert
organizer Nate Reisinger said that this
year’s Rock Against Rape had two main
goals: “Education...we want to make
resources available to victims of sexual
assault” and “to show how serious the
community takes sexual assault and
show compassion and support for the
victims.”

The concert offered students a chance
to sign a banner pledging to ﬁght rape
and sexual assault. T-shirts were given
to all pledgees, who were also given an
opportunity to sign up to receive infor-
mation about End lt’s efforts on campus.

Rock Against Rape featured perfor-
mances from student and alumni per-
formers including Copyist Crisis, Time
Ghost, D.O.P., and Beth Wellford. Drew
Martin and the Limelights headlined the
concert.

Wellford, a junior, was excited to
perform a mix of covers and originals to

support sexual assault awareness. “lt’s a
great cause and something that everyone
should be aware of, especially here,” she
said. “lt’s a great way to get attention in
a positive way.”

Students who attended the concert
were impressed and entertained by the
various acts. “The concert was quaint,
yet personal,” said ﬁrst-year attendee
Mark Farley. “The artists performed
well and the crowd responded appropri-
ately.”

“The concert displayed the talents of
several great artists who all came togeth-
er to support a great cause.” ‘said ﬁrst-
year Sarah Ward. “The weather couldn’t
have been better and it was a great way
to spend a lovely afternoon with my
friends.”

Attendees were well informed about
the issue ofsexual assault at W&L.

“No campus is immune to sexual
assault,” said Ward. “While W&L ob-
viously has a wonderful student body,
incidents still occur. Anything that can
be done to limit the prevalence of these
incidents should be at the forefront of
our minds.” '

“Sexual assault happens every day,
whether we accept it or not,” said Farley.
“We need to raise awareness so that no
one has to go through the pain associated
with sexual assault.”

Mindbending Productions presents...

“Gambling and Graveyards, ” written and directed by W&L students, starring students and costumed by students

By Samantha O’De||
STAFF warren

During Gambling and Graveyards
talkbacks, an opportunity for audience
members to comment and ask ques-
tions about the production, one woman
remarked that she had found both plays
disturbing.

“Thank youl” said senior Ben Oddo,
writer and director of the first play, Vul-
tures.

Gambling and Graveyards, a Mind-
bending Productions show, featured Vul-
tures and The Players, written by junior
Jack Burks and directed by senior Jeni
Pritchett. The production premiered last
Thursday, Oct. 6 and ran through Satur-

» day, Oct. 8. Admission was free and the

plays were held at Johnson Theater in
the Lenfest Center.

Vultures, a one-act play, revolves
around the hilarious and macabre dis-
course between two vultures overlook-
ing a ﬁmeral. The two vultures, played
by senior Morey Hill and junior Jay
Stephens, banter back and forth in
good spirit until they realize they aren’t
squawking over another old “bag of
bones,” but a young girl, only 9 years
old. The mood becomes somber, yet hi-
larious, while both buzzards experience
an “existential crisis” over their fear
of the beyond. When they listen to the
dead girl’s loving brother Peter, played
by sophomore Brian Clarke, recount the
last moments of his young sister Ruth-
ie’s life, they scream in anguish. This
causes the audience to laugh until their

sides hurt while tears form at the sad tale
of Ruthie’s demise.

A dove, played by junior Ali Green-
berg, hears their grief and ﬂies down to
talk to them. She introduces herself~“l
am a dove!”—and, as the audience gig-
gles, offers advice to the two distraught
birds: “The present is a gift. That’s why
they call it the present.” In the end, the
vultures never resolve their existential
crisis, unless you count planning to be-
come a squash farmer resolution. Still,
the piece raises the unanswerable ques-
tions of life and death and leaves the
audience wondering where it is we go
when we die and where we were before
we were born.

After Vultures follows The Players,

a 10-minute play with only three actors.
They all sit around a table playing cards.
A fourth seat is ﬁlled only with clothes,
but the majority of the chips on the table
sit in front of the absent player. As the
play goes on and the three wonder about
the missing fourth, their words reveal
that they are in the middle of the desert.
Each speaks exclusively in one tense.
Past, played by junior Jesse Mozingo,
seems upset with the other two and an-
gered by their situation. Present, played
by junior Elizabeth Lamb, focuses on
what is happening in the here and now.
Future, played by senior Chris Veddern,
is incredibly optimistic and looks for-
ward to what good things he thinks may
come their way. They play ends as it be-

gan, with the three sitting around their
table playing cards. Little happens be-
cause the person who past, present, and
future “belonged” to is dead. Without
the fourth, within whom the three united
into a whole, they have little power to
change anything. ‘

Mindbending Productions is an en-
tirely student-run group that puts on
plays for the Washington and Lee com-
munity. Everything for the two plays,
fromthe scripts to costumes to sets to
actors, was supplied by W&L students.
Pritchett, director of The Players, is also
the president of Mindbending Produc-
tions.

W&L celebrates real beaut

Stacy Nadeau, one of Dove is “every-day beauties, ” shared her story last Thursday at the Hillel Houge

By Paige Gance
ARTS&LlFE EDITOR

Stacy Nadeau, one of the “every-day
women who appeared in the unique 2005
Dove Campaign for Real Beauty adver-
tisements, came to W&L last Thursday
to share her incredible story.

Her journey began when she was
Sophomore at DePauw. She was ran-
domly picked by talent agent who was
looking for “real people, real curves” to
model for a‘ Dove campaign.

Though Nadeau was certainly skepti-
cal of the whole thing and bothered by
someone calling her curvy, she took her

mom’s advice to accept the offer.

Six months, numerous callbacks,
and multiple photo-shoots later, Dove
chose six real women to appear in their
underwear in the Dove Campaign for
Real Beauty. Men and women alike may
have been shocked by the photographs
of women practically naked without any
airbrushing or perfecting, but the pur-
pose of the campaign was to get people
talking about “real beauty.”

Though the campaign has received
negative and positive attention, its goal

is to “widen the deﬁnition of beauty.”
Nadeau is convinced that the campaign
has, and will continue to, serve that pur-
pose.

Aside from telling touching stories
of success and recounting moments
of heartbreaking public humiliation,
Nadeau urges women to feel beautiful as
they are.

Dove surveyed women worldwide
with the sole question “Do you feel com-
fortable calling yourself beautiful?” and
only 2% answered ‘yes.’ As surprising as

that statistic may be, Nadeau uses imag-
es from the media to explain that society
prohibits women from feeling beautiful
if their bodies do not resemble those of
models and celebrities.

There are ways to change the percep-
tion of beauty. First, be a friend to others
and to yourself. Help a friend that strug-
gles with self-image, and you may even
be doing yourself a favor by boosting
someone else’s self-esteem. Stop “Fat
Talk” — Nadeau explains that women
should stop using phrases like ‘‘I’m big

boned” or “Do these pants make me look
fat?”

Lastly, Nadeau says that our rela-
tionships are incredible important, we
should surround ourselves with people
to lift us up, not bring us down.

Active Minds, Panhellenic Coun-
cil, and the Ofﬁce of Health Promotion
sponsored Nadeau’s talk.

‘till Dawn sends letters for St. Jude

Near y 80 students mailed oﬂ8I2 letters to help raise money for the Children is Research Hospital

By Colleen Moore
STAFF WRITE R

Participants at this year’s Up ‘till
Dawn charity event mailed twice as
many letters as last year. They stayed
up all night last Tuesday and signed and
addressed 812 letters.

Ofﬁcially named Student for St. Jude
Event, the event raises money through
mail appeals for St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital. It is a national pro-
gram on many college campuses where
students stay up all night to write letters,
pledging themselves to raise money for
the hospital. President Molly Roun-
tree and Vice President Olivia Kantwill
worked with St. Jude’s representative
Erica Baca to make this event the best
yet at W&L.

As a letter writing campaign, Up ‘till
Dawn encourages students to sign their

names and the name ofa St. Jude’s child
on a form written letter. Not only do they
promise to raise money, but they are also
required to give a $5 donation to cover
free t-shirts and food at the event.

To help raise awareness for the event,
this year’s Up ‘till Dawn organized a
penny war among chosen W&L male
students to shave their heads. Decided
by the student body, the participant who
received the most pennies in his jar was
required to shave his head.

The penny war raised $269.70, nearly
half of which was injunior Isaac Webbs’
jar. He was shaved at the event on Tues-
day to symbolize the hair loss in chemo-
therapy patients.

The 70 to 80 students whojoined the
festivities in Doremus gym throughout

the night were provided with music from
the JubiLee and General Admission
a cappella groups, pizza and Sunrise
Sandwiches, as well as lots of candy.

A student from W&L Law spoke
about how the treatment her brother re-
ceived at St. Jude saved his life after he
was diagnosed with heuroblastoma at 17
months.

Up ‘till Dawn also organized a Mr.
St. Jude pageant in which four male stu-
dents walked the runway in superhero
costumes and answered questions. One
participant even split his pants practicing
his routine.

Kantwill became involved her fresh-
man year at the Activities Fair when Up
‘till Dawn was just being introduced to
the W&L campus.

“The hospital costs over $1 million
a day to run, and what is a more wor-
thy cause than children who are ﬁghting
terrible disease, and the doctors who do
research to save them?” said Kantwill.

She said students who want to be
involved in the future should make a
team with friends for the event, sign up
to perform, be involved in the activities
that raise money, or join the Executive
Board.

Kantwill also said she understands
how schoolwork and classes can over-
whelm college students.

“Students for St. Jude give you a
chance to step outside that realm, and
into something entirely different where
all of your time that night is beneﬁtting
others,” she said.

We may not know or ever know the
people we write the letters to, but many
of us are connected in some way to can-
cer patients. “To be able to know you did
something that could help cure cancer
one day in the future, is an amazing feel-
ing”

Last year, the event raised $6,000
from 400 letters. Kantwill is eager for
an even better outcome this year. “We
are hoping to mail about 1200 in total,
which, based on last years return rate and
average gift, could raise over $10,000.”

By Jayna Johns
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee
volleyball team extended its
winning streak to nine games
with a 4-0 run through the
Roanoke Col1ege’s two-day
Maroon Classic. The Generals
ﬁnished the Classic with a 3-0
win over Ferrum on Saturday,
25-11, 25-4, 25-15.

The Panthers have yet to
record a win in 21 matches,
while the Generals moved to
22-2.

Sophomore outside hit-
ter Allison Rouse led the
team with nine kills, while
four players tied for second
most with ﬁve. Senior out-
side hitters Megan Tomlinson
and Megan Daily, sopho-
more blocker Emily Hudson
and ﬁrst-year blocker Katie
Toomb each contributed to the
offensive effort.

The Generals real domi-
nance came from the service
line as the team recorded 20
aces, eight of which came
from ﬁrst-year Shelby Flores, _
marking the most the Generals have had in a
single match since recording 23 in a win over
NYU in the NCAA Tournament on Nov. 1 1,
2006.

On defense, ﬁrst-year specialist Kelly Mc-
Manus led the team with nine digs.

Earlier that day, W&L took on Southern
Virginia, coming out on top with a 3-0 win.
After a close ﬁrst set, the Generals improved
as the match went on, winning 25-23, 25-21,
25-14.

Daily, senior Lindsey Dee and sophomore
M.A. Boles all recorded 10 kills to lead the
Generals’ offensive effort, while junior libero
led the defense with 13 digs. Boles also had

eight digs andthree blocks, and Dee contrib-



uted four blocks.

Sophomore setter Meghan Meleski moved
to 10th place all-time at W&L for number of
assists in her career after recording 32 against
the Panthers, which gave her 1,402 total.

W&L took on Averett and Methodist in the
ﬁrst day of the Classic, winning each match
3-1. The Generals beat Averett in their third
meeting this season, 25-13, 20-25, 25-17, 25-
23,‘ and then returned to the court to defeat
Methodist 25-16, 15-25, 25-18, 25-14.

Against Methodist, Boles led the team on
both sides ofthe game, recording 18 kills and
16 digs in the match. Dee contributed with 13
kills and Daily added nine. First-year defen-

 

courtesy of generalssportscom ‘
sive specialist Kelly McManus came in be-
hind Boles with nine digs.

Earlier in the week, the Generals record-
ed a 3-0 sweep of Emory & Henry, winning
the sets 25-14, 25-20, 25-22. In the third set,
W&L came back from a 13-7 deﬁcit to pull
out the win.

Boles and Daily paced the team with 11
kills apiece, while Dee added nine kills and
three blocks.

Hill led the defense with 11 digs and also
added four service aces, while Boles recorded
10 digs and an ace to go along with her kills.

The women will be back at home on Thurs- .

day when they take on Randolph-Macon. Play
is set to begin at 7 pm.

Field goal lifts Generals

PeterAlston 3‘ 40-yard ﬁeld goal as time ran out helped W&L take down E&H 1 7-14

By Dessie Otashliyska
STAFF warren

Senior placekicker Peter Alston connected
on a game winning, last second 40-yard ﬁeld
goal on Saturday to give Washington and Lee
football its second conference win, a 17-14
victory over Emory & Henry.

The Generals moved to 5-1 for the season
and are now 2-0 in ODAC play.

After a scoreless ﬁrst quarter, W&L got on
the board ﬁrst three minutes into the second
quarter when junior running back Brett Mur-
ray found the end zone off 'a four-yard rush.
The Generals took that 7-0 lead into the half.

The score remained unchanged through the
third quarter, but the Wasps tied it up at 7-7
with 12 and a half minutes left to play.

W&L got the lead back less than two min-
utes later when senior quarterback Charlie
Westfal connected with junior running back
Russell Steward for a 55-yard touchdown.
The Wasps weren’t ﬁnished ﬁghting, though,

.1

 

as they came back with 61-yard touchdown
pass with just under six minutes left to play,
tying the game back up at 14-14.

Stewart fumbled the ball on ensuing kick-
off, giving Emory and Henry the ball on the
W&L 27—yardline. The Generals’ defense
stepped up and forced a fumble by Wasp quar-
terback Kyle Boden two plays later. Sopho-
more safety Mitchell Thompson recovered the
ball on the 21-yardline with 4:47 left to play.

The Generals then drove down the ﬁeld,
covering 56 yards in 12 plays and taking 4:43
off the clock. With four seconds remaining,
Alston made the game-winning ﬁeld goal.

W&L’s offense racked up 506 yards for
the day, overcoming an average starting ﬁeld
position ofthe 15-yardline. Westfal completed
13 of his 18 passing attempts to throw for a
season high 214 yards and one touchdown,
along with one interception — his ﬁrst since the

.9 .

third game of last season. The Wasps picked
him off in the end zone in the third quarter. He
also lead the team on the ground, rushing 20
times for a career-high 121 yards.

Junior running back Luke Heinsohn picked
up 77 yards with 18 touches, and Murray had
61 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries.

Through the air, Murray also caught ﬁve
balls for 40 yards while Stewart went for 58
yards and a touchdown on his two receptions.
Sophomore tight end Alex Evans led the team
in receiving yards, though, catching three
passes for 69 yards.

The defense was led by senior linebacker
Rob Look and junior safety Jake Pelton, who
each ﬁnished the game with 11 tackles.

The Generals will travel to ‘Randolph-Ma-
con on Saturday for a 1:00 p.m. kickoff.

Mock Con shirts: to sell or not to sell?

Bookstore rejects thirteen state delegation t—shirt designs, some for aloclzol references and inappropriate language

By Kelly Mae Ross
5 TA F F w R IT E R

The University Bookstore has re-
jected several of the Mock Convention
state delegation t—shirt designs that were
displayed at the delegate fair earlier this
month.

According to K.C. Schaefer, associ-
ate director and merchandise manager
for the bookstore and a W&L alum, the
bookstore enforced a broader university
policy on graphic review when it as-
sessed the t—shirt designs, 13 of which
were rejected.

Some of the rejected designs include
those from New Hampshire (“We come
ﬁrst...”), Utah (“I <3 <3 <3 polygamy”)
and Guam (“The snake in America’s
trousers”), according to Schaefer.

Members of the bookstore staff, in-
cluding Schaefer, conducted an initial
review of all 55 shirts. Four shirts were
ﬂat-out rejected for references to alcohol
or inappropriate language and 12 other
potentially inappropriate designs were
ﬂagged for further review. A committee
made up of two members of the book-
store staff and four members of Student

«Affairs conducted this second review.

Prior to submitting the designs to
the bookstore, the executive committee
of the convention reviewed them and
weeded out those it thought were inap-
propriate. Tricia King, general chair of
the convention, said the committee con-
sidered levels of creativity and appropri-
ateness when reviewing the designs.

King said that the committee allowed
some shirt designs that “toed the line”
between appropriate and inappropriate
to go through because committee mem-
bers thought that the creativeness factor
outweighed the potential lack of appro-
priateness. '

“There’s always a sense that we want
to outdo the [Mock Convention] before
[us]. So I think in doing that you can

push the boundaries a little bit, which is
a good thing in a lot ways, but not al-
ways in  the way of t-shirts,” she said.

King said that the news of poten-
tial design rejections did not come as
too much of a surprise to the execu-
tive committee, though the bookstore
had not made its ﬁnal decisions at the
time of King’s interview. She said that
the executive committee entered into
an agreement with the bookstore that
would allow the store to have ﬁnal say
on all Mock Con merchandise designs
since the store is helping with the order-
ing and price negotiation aspects of the
memorabilia.

“We [the executive committee]
signed off on that in the beginning and
we knew to some extent that [this review
process] would happen. So I wouldn’t
call it censorship as much as I would call
it approval,” King said.

But while the executive committee
may not have been surprised by news of
the design rejections, some of the state
chairs were.

ONE FINE TRADITION...

The design for the Tennessee delega-
tion t-shirt is among those that have been
rejected by the bookstore. The t—shirt de-
sign was vetoed because it prominently
featured a Jack Daniels whiskey bottle
on the back. The whiskey bottle label
was altered to have information about
W&L and the Tennessee delegation in-
stead ofthe standard Jack Daniel’s logo,
and beneath the bottle was the slogan,
“One ﬁne tradition deserves another.”

Hank Ingram, Tennessee state chair,
said he took the design ofhis state’s shirt
very seriously. He said he spent hours in
front of the computer, working pixel by
pixel to create the W&L-speciﬁc label
for the whiskey bottle.

mostly because I felt it wasn’t explicitly
saying, ‘Hey. drink Jack Daniel’s,’” In-
gram said. “I felt it was taking a pop cul-
ture icon and twisting it to W&L.”

Ingram said he was informed last
week that his design did not make the
cut, and he has since started working on
a new design.

But he isn’t happy about it.

Ingram said he doesn’t think it was
fair of the bookstore to veto all shirt de-
signs containing any references to alco-
hol.

“I mean it’s ridiculous. We can’t sell
a t-shirt that has an alcohol bottle on it,
but in the bookstore we can sell shot
glasses and tumblers and all this stuff. 
What are people going to be putting in
those‘? Coca-cola?”

Ingram said that he received no
warning that his shirt design might be
inappropriate between the time that his
preliminary and final designs were sub-
mitted.

Frank Cullo, New Hampshire state
chair, was also not happy when he heard
that his state t—shirt design was going to
be rejected by the bookstore.

Cullo said he thought it was “com-
pletely unfair” to allow the state chairs
to recruit people for their delegations
with slogans and t-shirts that students
won't be allowed to use anymore.

This is not the first time the univer-
sity has dealt withliinappropriate Mock
Con state t-shirts. In fact, the steps that
the university and the bookstore are tak-
ing with respect to the shirts may be a
partial result oft-shirts that were printed
in the past that members of the W&L
community found offensive.

THE IDAHO SIIIRT

In preparation for the 2000 Mock
Convention, students from the Idaho
delegation had t-shirts made at a lo-

cal shirt shop that
faculty and
students re-
ferred to

as “the

Idaho

shirts”
for years af-
terward.

There are
members of the
faculty who
still recall these
shirts, more
than a decade
later.

The Idaho
shirts from
the 2000
convention
were ref-
erenced in a
March 201 I report \
written by the university’s Ad Hoc
Committee for a Course on Respect and
Responsibility. According to the report,
“For a recent Mock Convention parade,
the Idaho delegation created a float with
a banner ‘I Da Ho,’ and female students
dressed as prostitutes rode on the ﬂoat.
There was also an ‘I Da Ho” T-shirt
based on this theme.’”

The inappropriateness of the t-shirts
was exacerbated by the fact that they
featured a cartoon image of a buxom
black woman in a skimpy red dress and
boots underneath the “I Da Ho" banner.

Professor Ted DeLaney ofthe W&L
History Department remembers the Ida-
ho shirts and said they “really polarized

his scorn for the shirts, calling them
“vulgar, wrong, hurtful and offensive.”

The faculty took out full-page ads in

Washington and Lee Mock Convention has announced its

keynote speaker: retired Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour.
According to Mock Cori Speakers Chair Sorelle Peat, Barbour was

on the target list for speakers since planning for this convention started

since he has been an inﬂuential leader in the Republican Party “and «he

was a strong contender for the Republican candidate for the presiden- A

tial election in 2012 before he pulledlout of the race last April.”

“Govemor Barbour is a prominent player in the Republican Party
and his insight and experience means that he’ll be able to offer some
great advice to all of us participating in the convention, particularly
the political team, about how to achieve our goal. . .correctly choosing
the Republican presidential candidate,” said Mock Convention Com-
munication Chair Kelli Jarrell. ,

As governor of Mississippi, Barbour has focused on making the
state “a better place to live, work and play through strong support
of job creation, schools, health care, energy, safer communities and
stronger families,” according to governorbarbouncom. ‘

Barbour’s election in 2003 was one of the largest gubernatorial
turnouts in the state’s history. His popularity has increased since’.

He was re-elected governor by 58.2 percent of the vote in 2007 G

and “is only the second governor since Reconstructionto be elected
to a second consecutive term” as governor in his state, according to
govemorharbour.com. . .
During his six years as governor, Mississippi increased in per cap-
ita income by 27 percent. _ _

Barbour’s success as governor has led to him receiving several
honors and awards. According to his website, he was Governor of the
Year in 2006, he received the Gulf Guardian Award for his work with
the damages inﬂicted on the Gulf Coast in recent years and received
the Adam Smith Medal from BIPAC.

Barbour is also a leader in the Republican Party as the Chairman of
the Republican Govemor’s Association.

“This announcement brings us one step closer to the actual conven-
tion and having Governor Barbour as the keynote speaker is some-
thing that I, and the rest of the campus, can be excited about from now
until February,” said Jarrell.

Washington and Lee Mock Convention is bringing the convention
to parents by holding a Silent Auction this Friday. Parents will be able
to attend the auction from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.in. and winners will
be announced at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday in the Outing Club Resource
Room.

According to Mock Convention Communications Chair Kelli Jar-
rell, there is great diversity in items available and in price range so “as
many parents and students as possible" will come to the auction.

ltems offered at the Silent Auction include a beach vacation in Sea
lsland, a stay in a l9th Century English Cottage, Carolina Panthers
Tickets, hotel rooms for graduation and next year’s Parents Weekend,
dinner at local restaurants, a ﬂy ﬁshing package from Trouthunter and
Fancy Dress ticket packages.

All funds raised from the auction will go towards the general ﬁnd
for the Mock Convention, said convention‘ treasurer Brandon Allred.
The general fund “is used to cover expenses for all aspects of the Con-
vention, from speakers and the parade to the Presidential Gala,” Allred
said.

While the Silent Auction is one way that W&L parents will beable
to get involved in Mock Con, they are encouraged to support the con-
vention ﬁnancially and can visit mockconvention.com for more infor-
mation on how to get involved.

“There were many Mock Con parents in attendance at the Spring
Kickoff events and we hope the Convention will be equally well at-
tended,” Jarrell said.

Regional media, including The Roa-
rzoke Times and T he Daily Progress
of Charlottesville ran stories about the
Idaho shirts. DeLaney said the shirt may
have been caught by one ofthe C-SPAN
cameras that were at the convention, but
he said he could not be sure.

DeLaney said that a faculty task force
was set up in response to the t-shirt in-
cident (and several other incidents that

occurred that year) speciﬁcally to deal
with issues related to diversity on cam-
pus.

“That t-shirt helped to change
W&L,” he said.

LEARNING FROM THE PAST

Back in 2000, the university did not
reviewthe Mock Con state delegation
t-shirts before they were ordered and
printed. 11 years later, that is no longer

the case.

King said students will be notiﬁed"

via email if the designs of the t-shirts
that they ordered at the delegate fair
have changed. Students will be able to
un-order the state shirts and get their
money back if they do not like the new,
university-approved designs.

But the t-shirt money reimburse-
ment process could turn into a logistical

nightmare for those who are in charge of
it, considering the fact that over 1,600
students have already signed up to join
a state delegation.

King said that while the executive
committee may not necessarily agree
with all of the design rejections, these
vetoes are a small price to pay to up-
hold the reputation and the image ofthe
Mock Convention.

“We as an executive committee, as

a steering committee, we don’t want to '

look like any typical college organiza-
tion because we’re not,” King said.
“And if that means that the bookstore
has to ﬂag a couple of t-shirts that they
don’t think will be good for our school
image, but for our national image, then
so be it.”

_ A Dog Day Afternoon

Columnist Ali Greenberg describes the ins and outs of bringing a dog to school and says it 3 not for everyone

I got my dog,
Holly Golight-
ly Greenberg,
_ about 4 years
ago and my life
has never been
I the same since.
., She was a res-
 , cue -puppy, one
of ﬁve in her
litter at the shel-
 ter and the only

Ali G berg
EELUMEES walked by. A
beautiful roly-

poly ball of orange fur and little baby
bear paws that pounced all over. She
was, by all accounts, adorable then and a
gorgeous dog now. So while I only went
to the shelter to volunteer, I ended up
bringing her home.

But that whole no barking thing
ended pretty quickly which was a bit
of a disappointment. From the day we
brought her home I realized this was no
ordinary dog. She jumped over the dog-
gie gate or knocked it down entirely. She
had accidents so frequently it was as if
she was ruining our hardwood ﬁoorsjust
to spite us. She chewed up the comers

of the carpet, never learnt her name, and
ate long grass in order to cause a gag-
ging reaction. Yes, my dog went through
a period of bulimia.

The terrible twos came and went. She
became an ‘annoying three-year old, but

bows. Every now and then she gets into
the trash, she is even afraid of walking
down Washington Street at night, and
she must have been Green Dot trained
because she hates all boys and barks if
one gets near her. Holly is the weirdest

Dogs cost money too, and a lot of it. The bitch broke

a nail and I had to take her to the hospital...and said

goodbye to my paycheck. ‘

ﬁnally settled into what could be called
a “normal” dog. Holly was never as bad
as Marley or as loud as those yappy little
lap dogs and was ﬁnally able to hold her
bladder through the night. I had hoped it
would be the start ofa new era.

And then this summer my dad got a
job abroad, meaning that Holly, who had
stayed at home the last two years, would
now be living with me. At school.

It was a pretty big adjustment at ﬁrst,
but to be fair, it has been pretty nice to
have her around so far. My roommates
like her and luckily she doesn’t chew
our shoes. She generally just barks at the
window or sleeps.

But it is not all sunshine and rain-

and at times the most inconvenient.

Having a dog at school is difﬁcult.
I am not a morning person and making
it to my 8:30 a.m. class on a Monday
morning was hard enough without hav-
ing to get up even earlier to take my dog
on a walk. Last year I would normally
spend all day on thehill, but now I have
to make trips home in the afternoon to
feed her. When I get off of work, all I
want is to put up my feet, but there is
Holly, wanting to go out one last time
before bed. There is no longer any de-
bate about it; I am whipped.

Dogs cost money too, and a lot of it.
The bitch broke a nail and I had to take
her to the hospital. After the general

check-up, new food, nail removal and
vaccination, I picked her up and said
goodbye to my paycheck.

But having a dog at school is also
great in some regards. I know that no
matter how bad my day is, when I go
home Holly will be happy to see me. Our
morning walks on the Colonnade are
sometimes the only exercise I can ﬁt in
during my busy day and I would rather
talk aloud to my dog than just to myself,
although both are pretty sad.

Holly can be hard to care for some-
times. She isn’t a little lap dog, she is a
55-pound German Shepherd/Chow mix
that needs exercise and socialization and
training. Since I don’t have a yard to let
her out in, she requires a lot of attention.

My dog is also pretty stupid; there
really is no getting around it. But she
is beautiful and funny to observe and a
very loving creature. She knows when
she does something bad and I believe
that deep down, she earnestly tries to not
screw everything up.

But even considering how much I
love my own, I wouldn’t advise anyone
in college to get a dog. What made my
experience different was that I already
had Holly for four years before moving
her to Lexington, so she was no longer a

pup and I was already used to her behav-
iors. Too often college students do not
realize that dogs continue to be a com-
mitment after graduation, meaning that
the dogs well—being can be at risk and a
huge strain can be put on the owner.-

Yet, as stupid and difﬁcult as my dog
sometimes is, she» has taught me a lot
of valuable lessons which you can only
learn from taking care of someone other
than yourself. Most importantly; Holly
may be afraid to cross the street some-
times, but if she sees stairs, she climbs
them. It may sound silly, but that’s the
best lesson she could ever teach me.

On a complete tangent, here are three
things that are really grinding my gears
currently.

1. Taking someone’s (my) seat six
weeks into the semester.

2. Not saying hello to people on the '

hill. If you doubt that they remember
your name, just greet them with a simple
“hey.” Especially if you chatted with
them on a roof for twenty minutes at last
nights party. It’s simple kids.

3. Girls who try to rap “Super Bass.”
Either put in the time to practice like An-
nie Martin and I did or ﬁnd a new song,
you ruin it for the rest of us.

Winning Parents Weekend

Hungry for a little extra spending money? Stockton Bullitt explains how to make bank when your family visits Lex

College stu-
dents always
want to be treat-
ed like adults.
So what better
way to act like
an adult than to
manipulate your
parents? When
time comes for
the parents to
enter a retire-
ment home, do
you think that
they are going
to go willingly?
I don’t think so.
Furthermore, to make sure that parents

    

BySto-cllrton Bullitt
CDLUHHIST

don’t mistakenly give all their life sav-.

ings to charity in their will, adults need
to constantly manipulate their parents.

Therefore, Parents Weekend gives
you the perfect opportunity to work on
your manipulation skills. However, in-
stead of coercing your parents into a
retirement home or reworking their last
will and testament, you should use this
weekend to bleed. as much current and
future money from them as physically
possible. Yes, you may “love” your par-
ents, and maybe you don’t want to dry
up their bank accounts. But think about
this, if your parents use their hard earned
life savings to plan a second honeymoon,
that is money you can’t spend buying t-
shirts for Christmas Weekend or sweet
headphones from the bookstore. No,
you need money for yourself and your
friends.

So, how do you go about manipulat-
ing your parents into adding money to
your W&L account or even your bank
account? Well, you’ve come to the right
place. I happen to be an expert in tum-
ing my parents’ love and devotion into
ﬁmds for keg runs. All it takes is a little
planning before Parents Weekend. If you
think of yourself as a business, then Par-
ents Weekend is the investor day when
the outside investors get to see the fac-
tory.

Basically, this mindset means that

you should have two speciﬁc strategies
in bleeding money from your parents. .
First, you want to make your parents
want to give you money because they
think that you deserve it due to your
inherently superior character, espe-
cially relative to other siblings. Second,
you want to convince your parents that
you need money in order to survive at
a school like this. For example, if there
is any way that you can make yourself
look gaunt and malnourished, then you
should certainly do it. Parents who are
worried about the health of their child.
are much more likely to give you money,
so you can purchase those extra Sunrises
from the Co-op and smoothies from the
Hillel House.

Preparation for Parents Weekend

and not CNN. Ifyou are a southern busi-
ness major, make sure that Fox Business
is playing on your TV, and if you are a
northern business major, make sure that
CNBC is on. If you are not a C-School
major, then you should just have PBS
on your TV for safekeeping. As long as
your parents think that you watch bor-
ing television instead of FX, Bravo or
Comedy Central, then they will want to
give you more money so you can spend
more time “studying.” If you are really
gung ho about the making money off of
your parents idea, then you should pay a
friend to mess up your room while your
parents are gone. If your parents come
back after spending the day with you and
see that, through no fault of your own,
your room looks like Joplin, Missouri,

If your parents use their hard earned life savings to

must include all phases of your life. I-f
you are going to milk every dollar you
can from your parents, then they need
to see every aspect of your life. Now,
whether you portray every aspect of
your life in complete truth is up to you,
but I tend to stay away from erroneous
things like the truth. That’s why_I’m an
opinion writer.

Theﬁrst place you need to start is
your room. Your parents have not seen
your room in almost two full months, so
they don’t know what to expect when
you show it to them. Obviously the
ﬁrst thing they should see when they
open the door is a pristine room. Your
television should be playing one of four
channels. Ifyou are a politics major, you
should be playing C-SPAN at full blast.
Tell them that you have gotten really
into the “Congressional process” this
semester, and they won’t question you
for details as long as C-SPAN is playing

then they will think that you need money
for cleaning supplies because your ram-
bunctious friends and/or roommates take
advantage of your innocent cleanliness.

Next, you want to fool your parents
into thinking that you have great rela-
tionships with all the adults. First, if you
are a male and your father is coming to
Parents Weekend, make sure that you
learn the ﬁrst names and faces of every
weight trainer on campus. That way, if
you pass by one on campus, you can say
“Hey Josh,” and fool your parents into
thinking that you spend every day hitting
the weight room even though you don’t
quite know what the inside of the ath-
letic center looks like.

After that, you need to go after your
teachers. Ifthere is a week that you de-
cided to go to class, this should probably
be it. You don’t need to spend much time
actually listening to what the teachers
say, but you should probably note one

thing that was said in class. If you do
this successfully, then you can safely
complete this mad-lib when you pass by
professors on the hill with your parents:
“Hey Professor [insert professor’s name
here], I thought that [topic of class dis-
cussion] was particularly interesting this
past week. After thinking about it on my
own, I have become particularly interest-
ed in [topic of class discussion]. I even
found out that [random tidbit from Wiki-
pedia]! If you would like, I would love
to sit down and discuss [topic of class
discussion] further at your convenience.
Are you free on Monday morning at 8
am?” Keep one eye on the parents while
you are saying this; it’s pretty entertain-
ing stuff. I guarantee if you throw in the
Monday morning part, their mouths will
be open. Obviously, you won’t actually
be meeti_ng with the professor on Mon-
day morning, but by then your parents
will already have cut the check and will
be long gone from Lexington.

Finally, you want to show your par-
ents the REAL party experience. If you
are a freshman, that means you are prob-
ably spending the night explaining to
your parents why you got arrested dur-
ing O-Week. So what better way to show

‘ them how you actually got arrested than

to have them relive the experience for
themselves? If played right, this move
will get you vindication for your prior
arrest and will probably get you more
money for court fees in the long run. All
you have to do is start off by lulling your
parents into a false sense of security.
Bring them out to a party in town and get
them playing -beer pong. Parents have a
lot of pent up competitive emotion, and
therefore, they are perfect for beer pong.
Make them feel overly cool every time
they make a cup, like upperclassmen do
to freshmen. Ifthey win the game, they
will be feeling a high they have not felt
since they experimented with drugs dur-
ing their college years. By the way, you
NEVER allude to any kind ofdrug use in
any way; just because adults did it when
they were younger, you are a righteous
adolescent who would never experiment

nappy liallumeeu
from the Phi!

with marijuana or use Adderall before
starting a paper.

This is the perfect time to show your
parents how parties in Lexington actu-
ally function. Your parents will start
getting tired around lI:30, so once you
see the first yawn, you confront them. If
you feel that you haven’t milked enough
money from them yet, you can start a lit-
tle soliloquy about how interesting it is
that arrests and party crackdowns started
picking up at the end of20 I 0, which was
conveniently right around the same time
as the municipal bond market started to
collapse. Tell them how LexPo, in need
of new revenue streams, started look-
ing to W&L students to fund their ex-
pansions and pension funds. Tell them
how last year, LexPo started using noise
violations to fine parties on and near the
W&L campus, and then mention that for
some reason that habit died down a little
starting in the second semester when
Zullman’s seemed a little t_oo far away
for a party. Then, when you have their
attention, crack a beer and tell them to
“watch this.” Go out to the front porch
and get pulled away by the cops for
drunk in public or minor in possession.
Your parents will surely love to see their
child escorted from a porch through the
front lawn and onto the street for some
questioning. Make sure you tell them as
you are getting handcuffed that this is
the upperclassmen’s fault and that Lex-
Po and the school are working together
to make sure that students get home
safely. I’m sure your parents will buy it.

While there are many other things
you should do on campus during Par-
ent Weekend (the football game under
the lights, the rugby game at 1 p.m. and
plenty of stuff at the Art’s Center), I be-
lieve that you can make the most money
off of your parents by showing them
your own version of your day-to-day
life. Lastly, remember the coup de gras
on Sunday morning: waking your par-
ents up for morning mass. Your parents
are sure to put their faith in you and your
personal budget after morning mass.

her sisters. And

off she goes, into
the night, ready for the proposal, or so
she thinks...

This is not exactly what living in the
sorority house is like. We do not have a
spiral staircase, a huge knocker or sili-
cone boobs, but Perfect Day probably
describes our lives as well as it does
the lives of the Legally Blonde sorority
girls.

Parents Weekend will be the ﬁrst time
freshmen girls can tour sorority houses
and girls, I can assure you that you will
be pleasantly surprised. Sorority houses
are fraternity houses minus the muddy
ﬂoors, faint smell of beer, loud yelling
at the television on Monday nights, and
basement bars (a little disappointing
but we’ll survive). They are sparkling
clean with ﬁreplaces, balconies, televi-
sion dens, and beautiful views of rolling
mountains and the football team on Wil-
son Field.

Here are some things to consider if
you are planning on living in a sorority
house:

, 1. Where dem boyz at? Just a wam-
ing, freshmen, enjoy your time living
and eating with the other gender-
“dorm storm” your heart out and linger
in D—hall. When sophomore year comes
along, you will no longer be living di-
rectly above or on the same ﬂoor (Davis
what whaat), as the other gender. You
will also no longer be sharing meals with
them in D-hall. .

Now some of you may be thinking: I
don’t eat with boys and I hate the smell of
dirty socks on the first and second ﬂoors
of Graham-Lees. This change won’t af-

.fect me.’Trust me~it will. If you don’t
take advantage of eating with the other
gender, enjoy watching them eat. Your

days ofmaking fun ofboys for preparing
salads without dressing or feeling self-
conscious when you go for that second
frozen yogurt cone are numbered.

It’s fun living with all of your close
girlfriends, but it’s an adjustment. You
may feel like the only time you see boys
is in class, in the lib late at night when
they tell you that you “look tired” (aka
like hell), and at parties when they’ve
scooped their glass into the grain bucket
a few too many times and are staring at
you cross—eyed and slurring their words.

2. 24-hour food supply- And I thought

D-hall was bad...but hey, D-hall isn’t
open at 2 a.m. Sorority houses have re-
frigerators and snack containers open to
residents 24 hours a day. You may think
that living in the sorority house won’t
change your eating pattern because you
keep food in your dorm room. lfthis is
the case, I have a couple questions for
you. Do you have a humongous refrig-
erator in your room? If yes, is it ﬁlled
with greasy leftovers from lunch? And
if you say, “No, but we can order from
Papa John’s,” I have something for you
to consider. Does our refrigerator lock at
2 a.m. when Papa John’s closes? Case in
point. .
On the other hand, the 24-hour kitch-
en can be valuable when you have a lot
of work and need to munch on some-
thing to keep your eyes open. The never-
ending stream of boiling water, variety
of tea packets, and dozens of cereal op-
tions will keep you awake. A good GPA
may be worth a couple of extra pounds.

3. Automatic ligh_ts- Imagine walking
into a dark room, clapping your hands,
and having all of the lights tum on one
by one. Ah, reminds me ofa scene from
The Graduate (“What do you drink?
Bourbon?). This is a beneﬁt ofliving in a
green sorority house. Sometimes I even
play Harry by waving my pencil towards
the ceiling and whispering, “Lumos.”

The downside is that when you are
sitting in one place for a long time, the
lights think that no one is there and turn
off. You wave your hands wildly through
the air, as if you’re doing the Bernie
backwards, only to ﬁnd yourself out of
the range ofthe light sensor. This means
you have to get up out of your comfort-
able position and dance in front of the
sensors....every ﬁfteen minutes. By the
end of the night, you have completed a

dance marathon.

4. Gossip spill: Imagine a bunch of
hyenas swarming around an elephant
carcass. They pull off the meat, piece by
piece, bring it to their families and return
for more, never satisﬁed.

Then, imagine a girl with a piece of
gossip; maybe, “Kiki ran across Cadaver
Bridge topless!!!” The group of sophisti-
cated girls transform. into a pack of wild

If you are locked out of the sorority
house, you are three words: out of luck.
Not only are there rarely wanderers
coming by the houses late at night (or at
least I hope not), but also it is impossible
to wake your friends sleeping in their
third—ﬁoor rooms.

One night, I walked home with
friends from a different sorority. They
went to their house and I headed down

savages, parading . around the gossip
queen and begging her for more details.
Did anyone see her? Was she drunk? Did
she do it by herself? You can trust me
I won’t tell a soul. Nibbling on every
detail, hungry for more. Then, sharing
their ﬁndings. “A soul” does not include
my roommate or that boy I like. The
animals sprint to their dens (or take the
elevator...ahem) feeding their famished
roommate information. A disaster. Infor-
mation spreads like wild ﬁre and conver-
sations result in screaming, shrieking,
jumping around, and screaming some
more. Utter chaos.

Drinks may spill over fraternity house
floors, but gossip spills everywhere in
sorority houses. Fortunately, it doesn’t
stain the furniture... only reputations!

5. Bodies with ESP- Twenty fussy,
complaining girls all week long? Thank
you, pheromones. That one week every
month when the chocolate supply is
a little thin and everyone’s a little less
friendly. Hey, at least no one’s pregnant!

6. Locked out- If you forget your
swipe card and get locked out of Gra-
ham- Lees at 2:00 in the morning, after
you’ve been out or are heading back
from the library (wink wink), chances
are that someone with a swipe card will
pass by within ﬁve minutes. Worst-case
scenario, you tap on a guy’s window and
he gets out of bed and lets you in. Or
worst, worst-case scenario, you climb
into the ﬁrst-floor boys’ bathroom win-
dow and run through to the hallway with
your eyes closed. '

the row to mine. Unfortunately, I for-
got to bring my swipe card out with me
and all of my sorority sisters were either
asleep or at Chi Psi late night. I yelled up
to my friend’s closed dorm window hop-
ing to wake her. No response.

Then, a miracle happened. A pub-
lic safety car drove by and a kind staff
member let me in. I’ve decided that
bringing my swipe card out is a better
idea than relying on miracles.

7. Study in the library- “l’ll be pro-
ductive in the sorority house tonight,
even though I haven’t the past ﬁve
nights.” No. No. No. Don’t let yourself
make this excuse; I’ve wasted too many
hours already. Even when you have the
best intentions, studying in the sorority
house tends to be unproductive, unless
you lock yourself in the window-less
chapter room which is downright scary.
Do yourself a favor and go to the library.
I can assure you that the amount of dam-
age you can do to your brain from all of
the Diet Coke fountain sodas you would
drink if you stayed at the house will be
scarier than the late-night walk home
across Cadaver Bridge.

You will also accomplish a lot more. I

How did a busy night of homework turn
into a back massage train in the sorority
house living room? Good question.

8. Get in shape- Whether it’s defend-
ing yourself from a mysterious preda-
tor/ Cadaver while walking back to the
house alone at night, or ﬁguring out how
to make it to Robinson Hall in ﬁve min-
utes, you must be in. shape to survive

%come to life’ in a sorority house

sorority house life. Another solution to .

being on time is leaving the house 15
minutes before class starts, but why put
yourself through that? The extra ten min-
utes could be spent doing valuable stuff,
like sifting through Kim Kardashian’s
wedding photos. I’d much rather take the
chance and sprint if needed.

9. The Fashion Police live with you-
If you don’t like hearing what people
think about your outﬁt, don’t live in the
sorority house. If you don’t like getting
mixed messages because half the people
think your sweater is cute and the other
half think it looks like you’re going to
a business meeting rather than a party
(thanks, betches), don’t live in the house
either.

On the bright side, having friends

who will tell you their honest opinion is .

refreshing. Thank goodness there is no
more of the freshman year “oh my gosh

know you look mediocre.

to hear praise and self-conﬁdence boost-
ers, you are letting your guard down to a
critical swamp of alligators ready to eat
your outﬁt alive.

Another bonus——along with the un-
limited fountain soda, unlimited food,
and unlimited distractions comes. . .un-
limited clothes! Every night on the town
begins with a treasure hunt through 19
closets to ﬁnd the perfect outﬁt. Forget
your cowgirl boots at home? Have no
fear; do you prefer brown, black, or red?
Forget your black ﬁshnets and Convers-
es at home? Well, that may be a bit more
difficult. ..

All in all, living in a sorority house
is awesome. It feels a lot homier than a
dorm building and the houses have cook-
ing and housekeeping staffs. Adjusting
to an off-campus house next year may
be difficult and moving to a studio apart-
ment after school, even more difficult. I
guess there’s only one question: how can
I apply to become a house mom?

It was exactly a
year ago in Profes-
sor Mayock’s Espa-
; no! 220: Literatura
V Espaﬁola that I felt
this all-encompass-
ing desire to go to
Spain. We were read-
ing El Caballero de
Olmedo, a theatrical
masterpiece by Lope
de Vega and I imaged
myself spending af-
ternoons perusing the
sun-ﬁlled streets of
Madrid, surrounded
by historical, architectural and literary great-
ness. I compared this potential reality to
a third fall of rush dates and Windfall and
I thought, “I need to go, I need to get out,
now!” And that’s where it all began...

Needless to say, I became interested in the
idea of studying abroad. I spent the summer
working in Argentina, I’m in Madrid this fall
and l’ll be attending University College Lon-
don in the winter. Yes, I’m fully aware ofthe
slightly cliched Eat, Pray, Love implications,
but really, I think there is a certain brilliance
in leaving behind what is comfortable and
easy for a year and exploring the world. As
my mother has told me, “In life, it’s good to
be uncomfortable at times.” She’s right, I was
a little bit too comfortable at W&L.

Washington and Lee provides its students
with an exceptional college experience and
makes everything accessible. In fact, every-
thing is so accessible that it’s easy to only
study, sleep and eat. Everything’s right there
at your ﬁngertips. We don’t even have to
walk very much. The school has so much to
offer in terms of academics, class size and
a network of people who maintain a life-
long commitment to the community. How-
ever, the concentration of a small group of
people within an equally small geographic
area breeds a culture of strong academic and
social pressure. Reﬁecting on my past two
years at W&L, I notice two themes: socialize

and study. As an impressionable freshman, I
felt an overwhelming desire to be social as I
was thrown into the rush process. By soph-
omore year, as an established member of a
sorority, I became completely and unequivo-
cally obsessed with my GPA. I am by nature
an intense person but the number of sleep-
less nights I endured as a result ofmy anxiety
took a toll on my mental health. I spent all
of my free time studying or thinking about
studying.

Bearing my semi-psychotic tendencies
in mind, I encountered a bit of culture shock
when I arrived in Spain. By culture shock
I do not mean I suffered from your typi-

friends to drink casual strawberry sangria on
a Tuesday afternoon. Maybe we’ll sit there
for two hours, maybe not, but I certainly
don’t ever feel as ifl am wasting my time. I
don’t need to make excuses for enjoying my-
self. At school, whenever I take the time to sit
around with friends and chat I feel as if I’m,
somehow neglecting my studies. I always
have this feeling of overriding guilt that I’m
not studying which ultimately lodges itself
in the pit of my stomach and doesn’t subside

until my standard 2 a.m. bedtime. Let’s be se- _

rious, I a.m. is ambitious.
Recently, I was catching up with a friend
from W&L and he asked if I’ve changed dur-

cal American-abroad conuridrums. I’m not
afraid of the metro. I don’t miss peanut but-
ter. And, conversing in a foreign language
doesn’t intimidate me whatsoever. What
shocked me was how much Spaniards focus
on enjoying their lives. During my time here
l’ve heard the saying “Spanish work to live
and Americans live to work.” It was not until
I came to Madrid that I realized that during
my last year of college, I lived to do work. I
maniacally worked all week and by Friday,
overcame my nerves by racing to Windfall
and hoping to forget it all. On the contrary,
in Madrid, I do not want to forget a thing.
I’m learning to enjoy drinking alcohol as a
cultural experience, whereas before I only
viewed alcohol as a means of getting drunk.
Walk around the city on any day of the
week and cafes, bars and restaurants are
ﬁlled with Madrileﬁos chatting with friends
or family whilejenjoying a beer or a glass of
wine. Although it was a bit ofa difﬁcult tran-
sition, I’m learning that I can take pleasure
in sitting outside a Cervezeria or bar with

ing my time abroad. My initial and not so
eloquent response was “Yeah, I think I’m dif-
ferent. Like, I can’t explain it, I feel really
far away from everything at school.” What I
really meant in my overly-colloquial phrase
is that for the ﬁrst time since I arrived at uni-

_ versity, I am practically free from all obliga-

tions. Even though I spend most of my time
at W&L in Leybum, I’m still constantly con-
fronted by the social dynamics of our univer-
sity. It’s exhausting. The amount of school-
work we have creates one layer of stress
and the small-school environment slaps on a
whole new level of pressure with our unique
social culture. We’re all full-time students
and full-time friends. And, quite frankly, I’m

thoroughly enjoying being a student and tak-

ing a much needed break from constant so-
cialization. I’m trying to model the relatively
care-free Spanish way of life, and little by
little or one glass of sangria by one glass of
sangria, I think I’ll get there.

, Searchin for Lisa Irwin .

Allie Weiss describes therecent zsappearance of] 0-month-old baby, Lisa Irwin, and the ongoing investigation

Oct. 4 might
A_ have been- any
._ other Tuesday
night for Mis-
souri residents
Deborah Brad-
ley and Jeremy
Irwin. Brad-
,- ley had put her
7 daughter, Lisa,
, to bed around
10:30 p.m., and
; then retired for
the night. Lisa’s
father, Jeremy,
had been work-
ing the late shift. He came home around
4:00 a.m., and, before going to bed, went
to kiss his daughter goodnight. He was
greeted by one of the most terrifying
sights a parent can ﬁnd: his daughter was
nowhere to be found. .
He quickly woke Bradley, assum-
ing that she had the baby. But Bradley
claimed to be just as horriﬁed as he was,
and the couple quickly called the police.
That night marked the first in a nearly
month-long search that has since take
place. Lisa, a l0-month-old baby, whose
disappearance was made even more up-
setting by the fact that she’d been sick
at the time of her abduction, has had her
picture posted across the United States.
Hundreds of law enforcement ofﬁcials
have become involved in the case. At
every new turn, America has watched as
Lisa’s story unfolds with almost Dicken-
sian drama—from the anonymous bene-
factor to the mother suspected of kidnap-
ping her own child. The FBI has gone to
extraordinary lengths to ﬁnd Lisa; even

resorting cadaver dogs and polygraph
tests. These efforts have yielded surpris-
ing results.

On Oct. 8 after the local police and
ﬁreﬁghters had conducted a thorough
search of the property, even draining the
backyard well and lowering a ﬁreman to
check for evidence at the bottom, Lisa’s
mother suggested that the FBI perform

,a polygraph test. Although such an of-

fer might lead one to believe Bradley
had nothing to hide, the results would
later indicate that Bradley would fail that
polygraph test, placing her name ﬁrmly
atop the list of suspects. Even more sus-
picious, Bradley has since changed her
story, admitting that she saw her daugh-
ter at 6:40 p.m. on October 4th, not at
10:30 as she had previously stated. The
reason for this sudden change? Bradley
was black-out drunk.

FBI Agent Al Jennerich allows that
Bradley might have failed simply be-
cause of the trauma she has been through
since Lisa’s disappearance. “It’s so emo-
tional,” Jennerich says. “It’s so traumatic
for the parents. Even if the parents were
not involved at all, they can still feel re-
sponsible....Either [she failed] because
she is guilty of lying to the relevant
questions or she is under such a traumat-
ic experience that she feels guilty for not
taking care of her child, even if she had

no direct involvement in the disappear-

ance of the child.”

Nevertheless, Ashley Irwin, Lisa’s
aunt, recently told Good Morning Amer-
ica that she had no doubt that Bradley
would soon ‘be arrested, if only because,
“they have to pin it on somebody.”

Indeed, it seems that all who learn of

the baby’s disappearance want answers.
Joe Tacopina, a prominent attorney with
ofﬁces in New York, has emerged as the
family’s new representation. He insists
that he is not working pro bono, but
rather is being compensated by someone
who wishes to remain anonymous.- The

day. Witnesses say that the police left
the house with multiple bags of potential
evidence. While Bradley and Irwin have
told the media that they are cooperating
fully with the police, the warrant indi-
cates that the couple has been less than

‘hospitable. In stating the reason for the

price tag attached to Joe Tacopina’s ser-
vices is said to be about $750 per hour. "
Bill Stanton, a former policeman
from New York who now works as an
independent security consultant, is also
being funded by an anonymous woman.
This woman has put up a $100,000 re-
ward for the safe return of Lisa Irwin,
and, Stanton says, notes that no ques-
tions will be asked of the person who is
able to claim the reward. .
More recently, news has surfaced of
the ﬁndings of the cadaver dogs being
employed by,the FBI. The dogs were
able to positively identify the scent of
a corpse on the floor of Bradley’s bed-
room. The dogs are “specially [trained]
to recognize the scent of decaying, de-
composing human flesh. That’s what
they hit on. What the dogs are saying is
that they smelled that scent,” FBI Agent
Jeff Lanza says. A warrant allowed the
FBI to conduct a 24-hour long, aggres-
sive search of the property last Wednes-

search warrant, the police could be heard
saying that, “the extent of the search had
been limited in nature with [the parents’]
consent.” _

But, just when the parents begin to
appear guilty, a surveillance tape emerg-
es that could clear their names. The foot-

age is ofa man dressed in white, leaving

nearby woods at about 2:30 a.m. on Oct.
4. Mike Thompson, the most recent wit-
ness to come forward, told ABC News
that he had been on his motorcycle, on
his way home from work at about 4:00
a.m., when he saw a man carrying a
baby about three miles away from Lisa’s

home. He remembers this because, on _

a night when the temperature was just
below 45 degrees, the sight of a baby
outside with no clothes on is a startling
one. The man was about 5’7”, between
140 and I50 pounds, and was in his late
thirties. Just hours before, a couple who
lives a few houses down from the Irwin
residence witnessed a similar sight.

However, the FBI is taking this new
information with a grain of salt. First
of all, the man on the security tape has
no baby with him, and so police cannot
positively say that he was even involved
in Lisa’s disappearance. Secondly, FBI
Agent Brad Garrett believes it to be
highly improbable that the kidnapper
would stick around. The fact that the
man had only managed to move three
miles in two hours seems unlikely, and it
isn’t logical that he would have just hung
around. *

Another lead the police are exploring
is a dumpster ﬁre that took place in the
area, which has the potential to explain
the burnt clothes belonging to Lisa that
were found nearby. Bradley asserts that
her daughter was last seen wearing pur-
ple shorts and a purple tee-shirt. If the
neighboring couple who remembers see-
ing a mysterious man with a naked baby
recalls that night correctly, it is possible
that the man burned Lisa’s clothes in the
dumpster before taking her out of the
neighborhood.

For now, the search continues, seem-
ing to grow more disturbing by the day.
Anyone with information about Lisa Ir-
win’s whereabouts should call the TIPS
Hotline, at 816-474-8477. “The goal is
to ﬁnd that baby girl,” Tacopina says.
“I’m optimisticand conﬁdent at the end

‘of the day the truth will come out.”

How to breathe    

It is easy to encounter the divine  noon. Or, at. least,
that is what the ancient Greeks believed. If one seeks to

 meet with a god or goddess, it is easiest to do so when

the boundary between the worlds is banished, along
with all shadows——and that is when the sun casts its
’ light_ from the center of the sky; noontime.

My noontime was always captured by natural Ven-
- ezuela—the tenderly baked ground eliciting soﬁ blades
of baby green grass, the arms of stalks of leaves, openly
embracing the warmth of the sky, the sweet breath of
tropical ﬂowers—-vividly painting the ambience with ﬁ-
ery colors. And I began to notice how my breath stirred
the air, and how the air was stirred by others’ breaths, too.
And I came to thoroughly dissect the intricate, convolut-
ed rhythms of respiration, the interlacing reverberations

of inhale, exhale. And, through careful observation and

examination in my noontime appointments with nature, I have discovered: we
inhale the dust of souls, eternally entwined and permanently present within the

‘ undercurrents of the airiwe breathe, pervasive and almost indistinguishable but
for the hushed constant callings of echoed longing this dust elicits, of a profound
hunger to be known, and to be connected with all other beings for all eternity.
We exhale our own dust; we expel ourselves through swirling eddies of oxygen,
our souls contributing to the resonating music of The Yeam: we, too, long to be
inhaled; we, too long to participate in this resounding gust of perennial linkage.
And the central aim of respiring? To attain the ultimate communion of souls.
And this can be accomplished solely through learning how to breathe.

Former W&L professor’s

brushes dance

I-Hsing Ju ’s personal experiences color his artwork, his traditional Chinese rice paper scrolls on display in Staniar

By Ryan Johnson
S TA F F w R IT E R

Artist and past Washington and Lee
professor I-Hsiung Ju called on personal
experience to create his Chinese scroll
paintings currently on display in the
Staniar Gallery.

The traditional Chinese brushwork
on a rice paper scrolls depicts a series of
landscapes from his native Chinese set-
ting.

His time as a Chinese soldier during
the Second Sino-Japanese War holds
particular inﬂuence on his work. The
“city of clouds” in many of his paint-

ings is the same cloud cover that hid him
from the Japanese during the war.

“Paint bamboo every
day. You will live long
and happy. ”

His hometown of Jiangyin, Jiangsu,
also appears in his paintings. He de-
scribed the town as a place where even

the painters worked in the rice paddies
during the day. The gentleness of those
particular landscapes reveals a fondness
for his birthplace.

The exhibition is aptly titled “Jour-
ney Home,” and through painting, the
artist reﬂects on various inﬂuences and
heritage in his life.

He described his brushwork as a
“dance,” something both quick and el-
egant. The paintings must be executed
quickly to give purity to the lines.

First-year Sarah Helms described his

talk as “illuminating.”

“His artwork was made more beauti-
ful by the commentary,” she said.

Ju taught at W&L for more than
twenty years and was the ﬁrst tenured
Asian professor at the university. He in-
stituted an “Art in Taiwan” program that
took art students abroad to learn Chi-
nese brushwork. Ju retired from W&L in
1989 but continued to win teaching and
art awards long after that.

Clover Archer, the director of the
Staniar Gallery, introduced Ju as some-

one who “greatly inspired countless stu-
dents.”

Ju was invited to talk at W&L this fall
by art professor Pamela Simpson, who
passed away Oct. 4. Ju honored his col-
league with a moment of silence at the
beginning of the night.

The painter’s work will be on display
through Nov. 2. As for advice to the
W&L community, Ju said “Paint bam-
boo every day. You will live long and

happy.”

Learning the way of the tea

Kaiseki teachers ﬂy in from west coast to share Japanese tea and cuisine, students learn about “Chado ”

By Gabrie|leTremo
STAFF WRITER

Kaiseki teachers Larry Sokyo Tiscor-
nia and Kimika Soko Takechi ﬂew from
the west coast to Lexington, where they
used their combined 70 years of expe-
rience to share the joy of tea and Japa-
nese cuisine with Washington and Lee
students.

They gave two separate demonstra-
tions last week that focused on this tra-
ditional tea food, often showcased in the
tea ceremony of Japan.

They also discussed Chado, or “the
way of tea,” in their lecture on Wednes-
day. The Japanese treat the tea ceremo-
ny as one of the traditional arts, and it
is practiced and respected like painting,,
calligraphy, or Japanese drama.

A chaji, or formal tea, will last ap-
proximately four hours, almost like a
Western dinner party. In the course of

the chaji, a kaiseki meal is served.

Tiscomia said in his lecture, “Kaiseki
has a long history with roots in ancient
China. It was brought to Japan by Zen
monks who had gone to China to learn
other arts like ceramics and calligraphy.”

" Kaiseki consists of a rice dish, a
soup, and three small dishes all served in
individual bowls on trays.

On Friday, Tiscomia and Takechi of-
fered an interactive kaiseki workshop.
Students were taught to construct a ﬁsh
wanmono (soup course) called kuzu-
tataki. They prepared a piece of poached
white ﬁsh in a traditional Japanese dashi,
or soup stock, topped with cucumbers
and lemon rind to freshen the taste.

Slowly, the aroma of quickly poached
ﬁsh overwhelmed the static nature of
the cold fall air, and combined with the

sweet dew smell of freshly cut English
cucumbers. Citron oil wafted about the
room within the steam from the simple,
elegant broth.

“In the Kaiseki Workshop, we were
able to see the actual production of the
meal, rather than just seeing pictures of
the dishes,” said student Lauren Mosely.
“It felt like a real connection with the
Japanese culture.”

For example, the cucumber not only
adds color and ﬂavor to the dish, it is
also a Japanese symbol for the moon.

Takechi taught the students how to
prepare the intricately cut cucumbers.
First, one must carve a small circle in the
cucumbers so they don’t fall apart when
you take out the middle. Even the way
you cut the cucumber contributes to its
texture.

Each and every motion in kaiseki is
consistent with a feeling, a purpose, and
a contribution to the wholeness of the
meal.

“People are amazed
at the wonderful taste of
something so simple,”
Tiscomia said. “Kaiseki
really is simple, but it’s
all the other elements,

especially seasonality
and subtlety, that com-
plete it.”

Tiscornia was ﬁrst
introduced to Japanese
food through sushi, and
it became a great passion
for him~ leading him to
open the ﬁfth sushi res-
taurant in San Francisco

 

in 1976, despite being told that sushi
“would never be popular” in the U.S.

Hispanic heritage dinner a hit

T he food an culture of diﬂerent Spanish—speaking countries highlighted at the Marketplace last Wednesday

By Cynthia Lam
5 TA F F w R I T E R

Lively music, colorful decorations,
and mouth-watering dishes topped the
menu for the Hispanic Heritage Dinner
hosted by the dining hall staffin the Mar-
ketplace last Wednesday. The festivities
attracted many students, faculty, and lo-
cal community members to experience a
taste of Hispanic culture and embrace its
culinary diversity.

The dinner featured a variety of foods
from different Spanish-speaking coun-
tries, including lentil empanadas from
Argentina, black beans and saffron rice
from Cuba, cerviche de camerones from
Peru, and seasoned hot chocolate from
Mexico.

According to Assistant Manager
and Special Events Coordinator Kelly

Brown, the purpose of the meal was to
“create a special theme event for stu-
dents” and to Ieam more about other
cultures.

“We enjoy doing it because it gives
us a chance to do different things and be
a part of the diversity,” said Brown.

Weeks of planning and preparation
went into organizing this event. Students
from various Hispanic backgrounds and
faculty members from the Spanish de-
partment worked together with the food
services staff to develop the menu, deco-
rate the Marketplace, and promote the
dinner within the community.

The whole back-and-forth process
was very collaborative, said Brown. Stu-
dents brought in family recipes for dish-

es as well as their own decorations, and
the dining hall staff incorporated them
into the event.

“This works better for us,” said
Brown. “We prefer that we have more
student involvement, because that’s what
we’re here for: to please the students.”

First-year Soﬁ Sequeira, a native of
Costa Rica, was one of the international
students who helped plan the dinner. Af-
ter being away from home for the past
two months, she enjoyed the opportunity
to share her culture with the W&L com-
munity. '

“The purpose of the meal was 'to
show other students that we actually
have a different culture and that we have
different food and music and customs,”

said Sequeira, “When you are so in-
volved with a new culture, you kind of
forget about your own culture, so it was
nice to have the opportunity to show my
friends and people I know that this was
part of me and this is who I_am. It made
me feel proud.”

Throughout the night, students and
staff got the chance to try new foods -
such as peixe con ‘Molho de Tangerina
from Brazil (cod poached with mush-
rooms, wine, and tangerine juice) and
arroz con coco y pasas from Colombia
(rice pudding with coconut and raisins)
- many of which they had never even
heard of before.

“When I saw a lot of new foods,
I got to the point where I didn’t know

what anything was so I just wanted to
try everything,” said ﬁrst-year Rachel

Samuels. “It was very obviously differ- ‘

ent from what was normally served and
it emphasized the fact that other cultures
exist.” ,

Samuels noted the difference in taste

and texture of the food compared to the I

dishes she normally ate.

“With American food, it has one sin-
gular block of taste, but Hispanic food
seemed to have a rhythm, like the taste
would change a little bit and hit you in
different ways,” she said. “The food was
deﬁnitely an experience.”

Different medium for economic coverage

ByMegan Shaw
STAFF WRITER

Though some assume these stories
are best for print journalism, Uri Berlin-
er,’ a deputy national editor at NPR, says
it is a goal of the organization to prove
the opposite: people respond differently
and perhaps better to the voices heard in
a radio program or a podcast.

At his lecture on Thursday night,
called Risky Business: Bankers, Gov-
ernments and Debt Bubbles, Berliner put
a fun, yet informative spin on the issues

of today’s ﬁnancial world.

Berliner, who has been'at NPR since
I999, oversees its Business and Eco-
nomic Coverage. It is important for NPR
to ﬁnd ways to excite its audience each
day, he said. '

Planet Money, a project that was cre-
ated out of the ﬁnancial crises _of 2008,
does exactly that. Berliner used several
of Planet Money’s humorous podcasts
and a witty video to essentially prove

that ﬁnancial reporting does not have to
be boring to be infomrative.

The lecture began with a discussion
of credit. Berliner said, “credit is the
most powerﬁil force in our ﬁnancial
lives.”

The psychology of borrowing, Ber-
liner explained, has its roots with Alex-
ander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson.
The American Revolution was ﬁnanced
with debt, and both Hamilton and Jeffer-

son had.positive visions concerning debt
that strengthened the United States as a
commercial power.

Berliner sped ahead in the history of
ﬁnance to the late 2000’s. He explained

the meaning of a credit bubble and that

debt can help leverage proﬁts — but that
it can, in turn, enhance losses.
In the 2008 recession, the bottom fell

out.
NPR and the producers of Planet

Money purchased a toxic asset at a dis-
counted price to help audiences under-
stand the root of the ﬁnancial crisis. Ber-
liner warned that the responsibility falls
on the shoulders of the current student
generation, and that we must continue to
remain accountable for our leaders, our
banks, and for ourselves.

Berliner was excited to announce that
Planet Money will next move into China
and begin covering their debt bubble.

I guess London is a ﬁtting place to write this piece thanks to
the recently enhanced speculation that an NFL franchise could
be across the pond in the coming decades. So for the moment,
I’ll pretend I’m starting the London Broils or Bridges or Ter-
riers or Fogs. I’ll need to handle this with care because, for
the ﬁrst time in my life, the players aren’t just players, they’re

right now, and we can only guess his conﬁdence is sky-high after last year’s performance-—
his third straight year of completing more than 63% of his passes.

If I were to write this again two years from now, Matt Stafford (or Cam Newton) might
be my picks, but they haven’t shown me enough yet. Brady would win other contests, but at
34, the twilight of his career isn’t that far away. Brees is a solid choice, but he’s already 32
and is currently at the peak of his career. We don’t know how great Aaron Rodgers is really

since Reggie Jackson in 1977 to hit three home runs in a World Series Game.

So I ’m going to surprise a few people outside Southern Wisconsin and select Ryan Braun.
I ﬁrmly believe that if this guy didn’t play up North in Milwaukee, he would be a more main-
stream choice in this category. Not that this will change anytime soon, since he just signed a
5-year $105 million contract extension in April.

He’s locked in with The Brew Crew until 2020 (with a $20 million mutual option in 2021).
Since 2007, whe‘r:r_Braun,won NI. Rookie of the Year, he has produced with remarkable con-

ster regular season at the plate, where he hit .332 with 33 HRS and 111 RBI, Braun came up
big for Milwaukee in the postseason and hit .405 in 11 games.

With Fielder likely leaving town in Free Agency this winter, the Brewers will be Braun’s
team, but I would rather have him take over mine.

   

When I sat down to write this article, I did a lot of think-
ing about what an ideal franchise player should be. I wanted
a young guy with years left to play who could hit third in my
lineup, play centerﬁeld or shortstop exceedingly well and be
an all around leader (I don’t ask for much).

I settled on Troy Tulowitzki as my initial choice. The Gold

ers and 100 RBI a year, rocked a mullet brieﬂy this season and
has Katy Perry as his walkup music. What more could you
want? . ..

Then I turned on game three of the World Series and saw
Albert Pujols go 5-6 with three home runs and I changed my
mind. 

Ve YOU their takeS- I tried my best to over think this choice. I tried to ﬁnd flaws

in building a team around Pujols (He’s 31, plays first base).
But all it took was watching Albert send three missiles into the
seats at the Ballpark in Arlington tojolt me back to reality.

Pujols is clearly the best player in baseball. He has been for the past few years. And
he will continue to be for at least the next ﬁve. If I’m building a team and I can have the
undisputed best hitter in baseball as the rock in the middle of the lineup then I make that
decision every time.

Albert is a once-in-a-generation talent. He is one guy I really want to see play live before
he retires. When we are old and gray we will be telling stories about Albert Pujols to our
grandkids. Not Ryan Braun.

Braun could very well develop into a Hall of Famer. But he also might not. There is no
question with Pujols. He is a ﬁrst ballot Hall of Famer. He is a proven champion. He is a
legend. And I would much rather have the best player in baseball for ﬁve years ifI’m build-
ing a team, then a younger Tulowitzki (or Braun, or whoever else) for 10.

For my NFL franchise player, I’m going to completely ignore my previous logic. I think
most would agree that the player to build a team around in the NFL has to be a quarterback
- no other position has as much of an effect on the outcome ofa game. And ifl continued
with my rationale of taking the best player in the game, then I would be inclined _to also
take Aaron Rodgers (though Rodgers does not equal Pujols on the imaginary sliding scale
of cross-sport player comparisons in my opinion; hecompares more favorably to Robinson
Cano. If he keeps up the statistical pace for a few more years, then maybe he can enter the
Pujols zone and earn legend status).

However, there is a player in the league right now, a rookie in fact, that has completely
captured my imagination. He has a unique skill set that "I think has the ability to change the
game. And ifI’m starting an NFL team, he is the guy I am taking ﬁrst.

Forget Brady, Brees, and what’s left of Peyton Manning. Forget Adrian Peterson, Calvin
Johnson, and Michael Vick.

Give me Cam Newton. Seriously.

Maybe I’m drinking too much of the Kool-Aid. And maybe I’m putting too much stock
into his highlights. But what I see in Cam Newton is a guy who can singlehandedly impose
his will on a football game. He is 6’5”, 250 pounds and can run over and around you. He
is conﬁdent, a winner, (and as Boobie Miles’ granddad says in Friday Night Lights) “AND
HE CAN PASS!”

I’m going against a lot of what I said in my argument for Pujols, but Newton is some-
thing special, even if he is not quite a proven commodity in the NFL. He has Mike Vick’s
skill set with a bigger, more durable frame. Plus, he is only 22. He needs to improve on
decision-making, but that will come with experience. A better receiving corps would also
help. While Aaron Rodgers gets to throw to Greg Jennings, Jermichael Finley, and Donald
Driver, Cam gets to throw to Steve Smith. . .and Legadu Naanee. Ugh.

Maybe I’m crazy. Maybe I’m blinded by Cam’s brilliant smile. But maybe, just maybe,
I’m right and Cam Newton will be the next big thing. Here’s hoping he is.

. Generafs season ends with a loss

An up-cmd—d0wn season ﬁnishes on a down after back-to-back losses, keeping the team out of post-Season play

By Angela Williams
STA F F w RITE R

The Washington and Lee ﬁeld hockey team end-
ed its season on a down note, starting with a 2-1 loss
to Roanoke College last Wednesday and ﬁnishing
with a 5-2 loss to Randolph-Macon on Saturday.

The Generals took an early lead against R-MC
when ﬁrst-year Candice Stefanic scored just 10:40
into the game, giving W&L a 1-0 advantage. How-
ever, the Yellow Jackets responded quickly, netting
four unanswered shots before time ran out for the
ﬁrst half, taking a 4-1 lead with just over two min-
utes left to play before the break.‘

W&L came out strong to score ﬁrst in the second

 

half. Junior Katelyn Daugherty took an assist from
ﬁrst-year Anna Kathryn Barnes to the goal after two
and a half minutes of play.

However, the team’s comeback attempt would
end there as R-MC found one more goal to secure
a 5-2 victory and end the General’s season with a
loss. 7

Junior goal keepers Caroline Sutherland and
Kirsten Kyne split time in the goal for W&L, with
Kyne playing the ﬁrst half and Sutherland coming
in for the second. Kyne allowed two goals while
Sutherland allowed three but saved two.

men’s soccer

The Generals took several shots at the Yellow
Jackets’ goal, as their keeper ﬁnished with six saves
for the day while only allowing two goals.

Earlier that week, Roanoke College came from
behind to pull out the win over W&L in Lexington.

Senior Lizz Dye scored the only goal of the ﬁrst
half, assisted by senior Christina Benedetti and
sophomore Taylor Zusi after a penalty comer. The
shot came just under 29 minutes into the match and
was enough to give the Generals a 1-0 lead to take
into the break.

The goal was not enough to secure a win, how-

ever. Roanoke scored twice in the second half, and
the Generals were never able to make another shot.

This loss marked the ﬁrst time since 2003 that
the Generals lost to the Maroons—W&L had won
each of the last eight contests.

With the losses, the team moved to 6-10 season
record and a 2-6 conference record, mathematically
eliminating W&L from qualifying for the ODAC
tournament and ending the team’s season.

W&L fell to Bridgewater but a 7-2

By Jayna Johns
SPORTS EDITOR

An up-and-down week for the Washington
and Lee women’s soccer teamsaw two match-
es facing conference foes. The ﬁrst ended with
a 3-0 shutout victory over Emory & Henry last
Wednesday and was followed by a 3-0 shutout‘
loss to Bridgewater College on Saturday.

The week’s results moved the team to a
12-3-2 overall record, including 7-2-2 against
ODAC competition.

Despite outshooting Bridgewater 1 1-4 in
the ﬁrst half. the Generals were unable to get
the ball past Bridgewater’s defenders. The
Eagles managed to capitalize on one of their
few attempts, scoring with an unassisted shot
16 minutes into the match and taking the 1-0
lead into halftime.

The Eagles turned around their first-half
struggles with shooting, outpacing the Gener-
als 8-3 for the ﬁnal 45 minutes. They scored
on two oftheir shots while continuing to shut
out W&L, allowing Bridgewater‘ to pull away

for the 3-0 win. :

Senior keeper Emily Leary played all 90
minutes in the net and recorded three saves.
Two Bridgewater keepers split playing time,
though their starter Cari Hensley played the
ﬁrst 85 minutes and registered all eight of the
team’s saves.

Earlier in the week facing Emory & Henry,
the Generals saw the same score at the end of
the matchmthis time, intheir favor.

First-year Holley Beasley scored two of
W&L’s three goals for the game. The first
came off an assist from classmate Katherine
Rush in the 20th minute, giving the Generals
a 1-0 edge.

Rush followed up with a goal of her own

just ﬁve minutes later, a header into the net off

a pass from Emily Scott, yet another ﬁrst-year,
increasing the lead to 2-0. The team would
take that score into the break.

For the ﬁnal score of the match, Beasley

courtesy of generalssportscorr

made an unassisted shot in the 68th minute.

The ﬁnal score does not show just how
dominating the Generals were throughout the
match. W&L outshot E&H 21-1 and held a
4-2 advantage in comer kicks.

Leary played the ﬁrst 72 minutes in the net,
recording one save, and sophomore Kingsley
Schroeder ﬁnished out the ﬁnal 18 minutes
without facing a shot.

With the win, W&L remains perfect
against the Wasps, having won all 17 meetings
between the teams.

Saturday’s loss to Bridgewater ended
W&L’s regular season, but the women will
continue to play for a conference title. The
Generals will be back on the ﬁeld this Satur-
day for the opening round ofthe ODAC tour-
nament. They will travel back to Bridgewater
for 1:00 p.m. contest.

5 straight wins for football

The Generals remain perfect in Conference play aﬂer Scoring 21 in the fourth quarter

By Dessie Otashliyska
5 TA F F w R IT E R

The’ Washington and Lee football team
pulled out a 52-42 win on Saturday against
Bridgewater thanks to 21 fourth quarter
points. The Generals improved to 7-1 for the
season and 4-0 against ODAC competition.

Offenses dominated much of the game,
racking up 1,090 yards between the teams
and 35 points in the game’s ﬁnal ten minutes.
W&L accounted for 606 of those yards.

Senior quarterback Charlie Westfal had a
hand in 271 of the Generals’ yards, enough
to make him the school’s new all-time leader
in total offense. Westfal now has 6,508 total
yards in his college career, breaking the previ-
ous recordset by Christian Batcheller in 1999.

With only two minutes left in the third
quarter, W&L took a 31-28 lead after junior
running back Brett Murray found the end zone
on a 32-yard reception. The Generals added to
that lead with 9:50 left to play when Westfal
ran in a 1-yard score to make it 38-28.

Bridgewater was not ﬁnished ﬁghting,
however, as they challenged the Generals’
lead with a 64-yard touchdown run just one
minute later. Despite this. the Eagles could
never quite regain the lead.

W&L then capped a 9-play drive, covering
73 yards, with a 8-yard» touchdown run byju-
nior running back Russell Stewart with four
and a halfminutes left in the game, extending
the score to 45-35.

The Eagles again responded quickly with
a touchdown of their own, pulling in a 21-
yard reception for a score only a minute and
a half later. ,T hat would be their last score of
the game, however, as they unsuccessfully at-
tempted an onside kick, giving W&L excellent
ﬁeld position. .

Westfal scored on a 3-yard run only four
plays later, making the score 52-42 with 2:00
left to play, essentially putting the game out of
reach for Bridgewater.

Senior linebacker John Kavanagh secured
the win by intercepting an Eagle’s pass, and
the Generals were then able to run out the
clock.

The win marked W&L footba11’s 10th-
straight ODAC victory.

Until the ﬁnal minutes of the game, neither
team led by more than a touchdown through-
out the game, and the Generals took a 24-21
lead into halftime. The Eagles took back the

 

lead only 58 seconds into the second half with
a 51-yard touchdown run, but were unable to
hold on to it in near the end of the third quar-
ter. ‘

Westfal completed 11 of his 15 passing
attempts for 162 yards and two touchdowns,
while adding 109 yards and two more touch-
downs on the ground off 16 carries. With his
performance, Westfal was named the ODAC
Offensive Player of the Week for the second
week in a row.

Murray found the end zone three times,
including two touchdown receptions and one
run, while rushing 17 times for 123 yards and
catching ﬁve passes for 74 yards. Junior run-
ning back Luke Heinsohn took 20 carries for
138 yards and one touchdown and caught two
passes for 40 yards.

On defense, senior linebacker Rob Look
and senior defensive back Jake Pelton led the
team with each recording 11 tackles.

Be sure to head out to Wilson Field on Fri-
day when the Generals host conference-foe
Catholic. Kickoff is set for 7:00 p.m.

Conference at VMI focuses on American and Chinese economic, political and ideological policies toward Africa

ByThomas Kent
STAFF WRITER

At a multiple panel conference held
last week in the Center for Leadership
and Ethics Building at VMI, ambassa-
dors, professors, high-ranking military
personnel and other leaders discussed
United States and China policy toward
Africa.

The conference,‘entitled “The Eagle
and the Dragon in Africa”, focused on
stability and economic development in
Sub-Saharan Africa.

Major General Donald Leins, a key-
note speaker at the conference, currently
serves in the ofﬁce of the Joint Chiefs
of "Staff and previously served as Dep-
uty Commander, Combined Joint Task
Force, Horn of Africa in Djibouti. He
addressed the issue with the question,
“Is China’s policy toward Africa altruis-
tic or neo-colonial?”

The answer to such a question was
debated and several times a reference
was made to the old East African prov-
erb: “When two elephants ﬁght, it is the
grass that suffers.” During the confer-
ence, the proverb was metaphorically
applied to China and the U.S. interaction
on African soil.

Leins discussed various possibili-

' ties for United States collaboration with

China in Africa, including multilateral
agreements, economic “hooks” and col-
laboration on transnational issues, such

New program allows students to prac ice interviews when

By Drew Carlos
STA F F w RIT E R

Washington and Lee’s Career Ser-
vices’ newest program allows students
to prepare for upcoming job interviews
in a new way.

The program——InterviewStream—
enables students to practice interview-
ing for a job in the ﬁeld of their choice,
answer thousands of questions and see
their interview replayed immediately on
the screen.

Students can ﬁnd Interviewstream
through a link on the Career Services
website. The next step is to create an
account and then take advantage of the
entire program. InterviewStream is free
for all W&L students.

InterviewStream is exactly like a
real interview. Students can choose the

as the proliferation of WMDs, natural
disasters, pandemics, and humanitarian
intervention. The “hooks” refer to situa-
tions with “mutually good outcomes” for
both parties that facilitate collaboration.

Ambassador Priscilla Clapp, a retired
minister-counselor in the U.S. Foreign
Service, brought a different perspective.
“We need to look at how China can al-
low Africa to proﬁt,” Clapp said.

She said China’s position is not
analogous to the Soviet Union’s position
in the Cold War, because China “recog-
nizes its dependence on the rest of the
world.” A

“China’s rise can help other coun-
tries,” Clapp said.

The fact that China and the U.S.
have diﬁiculties collaborating in Africa
was addressed. Charles Horner, a panel
chair and senior fellow at the Hudson In-
stitute, said that “almost all of the issues
have to do with differences in political
systems.”

Dr. Raymond Gilpin, a director at
the U.S. Institute of Peace, said the in-
teraction between the United States and
China should not be stated as the actual
struggle depicted between the two el-
ephants.

Referring to such a competition, Gil-
pin said, “We are not in a cold war envi-
ronment or a bipolar world. ‘The world

the workforce, click on as many or as
few questions they would like to an-
swer, partake in an interview with a real,
but recorded, person, and review their
interview once it is over. Only the stu-
dents will see their interviews, or, if they
would like, can send them into a career
services advisor for critiques.

One of the unique features of the
program is the ability to count the num-
ber of times one uses “umm,” “like,” “I
mean,” and “you know.” While these
ﬁller words may not seem like a prob-
lem, they can cause an interviewer to
think one is unprepared or trying to
make something up, Martine said. This
tool not only gives students the ability

is more globally integrated. For both
China and the US, Africa is not a strate-
gic property. Adversarial competition is
not inevitable.”

Gilpin said, “Would you become ad-
versarial over 5 percent GDP of trade.”
According to the African Development
Bank Group website, “China-Africa
trade comprises only 4 percent of the to-
tal Chinese imports and exports,” but is
likely to continue to grow.

In terms of trade, Gilpin said, “China
and the US need to come to grasps with
market access. Africa does not and will
not account for 25 percent of U.S. oil.
For China, Africa is more ofa long-terrn
strategic engagement issue.”

Gilpin suggested that one of the el-
ephants might have an intrinsic advan-
tage. Referring to the Chinese company
bids taking place in Africa, Gilpin said,
“Competition is good. It would good for
China, the U.S., and Africa if everyone
played by the same rules. We need each
bidder to be on the same playing ﬁeld.

She said China’s desire for raw mate-

Run like 21 °

Track team sponsors clinic for local girls

By Leigh Dannhauser
5 TA F F w R I T E R

Nearly 60 young girls showed up
at Wilson Field at 9 Saturday morning
ready to run.

They were there to participate in
the Run Like a Girl clinic presented by
Washington and Lee’s women’s track
team.

Girls as young as 3 and as old as 14
ran, hurdled, and long jumped over the
course of the ninety-minute clinic.

The ﬁrst hour was dedicated to four
different stations. These stations were
nutrition, hurdles, motivation, and long
jump. The girls remained at each one for
about ﬁfteen minutes.

“It was deﬁnitely a little hectic mov-
ing the groups so quickly, but the all of
the girls caught on really fast and had a
blast,” said ﬁrst-year Jillian Katterhagen.
Katterhagen helped run the hurdle sta-
tion.

When the music started to play, the
girls moved on to thenext station.

After the hour was up, the girls all
grouped together for some stretching and
then divided back into their age groups

for some running around on the track and
turf.
Overall, the members of the track

team who ran the clinic said the event . ' ' V-

was a success.

“It was a great opportunity to in-
troduce younger girls to running and
healthy lifestyles,” said sophomore Julia
Murray.

“It was great seeing the energy of the
young girls,” added ﬁrst-year Jennifer
Friberg. “They all said they liked to run
because it was fun and you don’t hear
that from a lot of teens or adults.”

Murray and Friberg were age group
counselors. Those working the stations
agreed.

“The clinic was awesome as a whole,
it was fast—paced and fun, and everyone

there was super enthusiastic,” Katterha— 
gen said. “Besides the cold weather, it

was a great morning.”

Nearly 60 young women turned out for a morning of running,jumping and learning about ﬁtness.

Brieﬂy: Operation Christmas Child

Alpha Theta Omega and Quest Scholars to sponsor “packing party ”for organization that helps children

By Victoria Bell
STAF F WR ITER

If you’ve never heard of Operation

Christmas Child...get excited. Operation
Christmas Child is an organization that
is part of the Samaritan’s Purse interna-
tional relief efforts. lndividuals pack shoe
boxes full of personal essentials and fun
stuff for children in foreign countries that
go without things they need on a daily
basis. Without the efforts of Samaritan’s
Purse, these" children would not have the
opportunity to celebrate Christmas.

On Friday, Nov. ll from 7 p.m. to
midnight, Alpha Theta Omega and Quest
Scholars are sponsoring a “packing par-
ty” for Operation Christmas Child in the
Commons Living Room. Tables will be
set up in commons this week with vol-
unteer sign-ups, donations, and supply
drop-offs. Those that plan to participate
in the event are asked to bring supplies
(see suggested list of gifts) and an extra
shoe box. Be sure to drop by the Com-
mons Living Room between 7 p.m. and
midnight on Friday (attendees are free to
come and go as they please), grab some
pizza and cider, listen to Christmas mu-
sic, and join in on the holiday spirit of
giving!

3 - THE RING-TUM PHI -

 

opinions

In defense of pledgeship...

Do boys beneﬁt from living in misery for8 weeks of freshman year? Columnist Stockton Bullitt thinks so.

I probably
should’ve saved
this article until
January or Feb-

ruary, but my
other ideas this
week weren’t

quality choice.
See, I wanted
‘ to write about
good new tele-
vision shows,
but since I ap-
parently don’t
have enough au-
thority to send
a reply all email to the “Pink to Drink”
email chain, I don’t think I have enough
authority to convince you that “Dan
Lebatard is Highly Questionable” is a
good show (even though it’s better than
any other non-PTI afternoon show on
the ESPN networks). Therefore, I think
I’ll talk about pledgeship and hope that
freshmen don’t read the Phi.

I’ve always had a problem with how
the school characterizes pledgeship at
W&L. I never could understand why,
but despite being a dirty, stinking liberal,
I always seem to ﬁnd myself defending
fratemities on this campus. The problem
is, when you are arguing against profes-
sors and administrators, it’s often hard to
develop a solid counter-argument to the
whole “How is putting freshmen (sorry,
ﬁrst years) through pain and hardship a
good thing? How is that helping them?”

Honestly, when you phrase it like
that, there really isn’t much justiﬁcation
for the process as a whole. So, despite
having this general discussion many
times over the course of four years, it
wasn’t until I had a Mountain Dew Amp
(by the way, Mountain Dew is a much
better energy drink than Monster, Full
Throttle, and maybe even Red Bull;
Mountain Dew knows how to make
drinks that hype you up and add no ad-
ditional value) on the way back from
Richmond, that I developed some sem-
blance of a defense. Yeah, I’m an apolo-
gist, but I think that this can be at least
relatively useful when justifying to your
parents why you need to bring your car
to school and borrow $5,000+ to join a
club that adds no signiﬁcant value to the
rest of society. Just to be clear, I am not
speaking in defense of pledgeship at oth-
er schools,_nor am I speaking in defense
of pledgeship ten years ago. Let’s face
it, pledgeship nowadays is more watered
down than my parents’ vodka when I
was in high school. I don’t want to ar-
gue whether or not this is a good thing

(again, since I am a dirty, stinking lib-
eral, I tend to think progress is good, but
that’s my bias), mostly because I don’t_
ﬁnd it that relevant to this argument. I
am only arguing about how the current
W&L system functions, and after seeing
the successes and failures of pledgeship
for three years now, I think I have a rea-
sonable idea of what pledgeship really is
and why it functions the way it does.
When debating over the merits of
pledgship, the two opposing forces tend
to be adults and college boys. Most
adults tend to argue that pledgeship, at
least how it’s practiced at W&L today,
is a bad thing that taints (haha taint) the
innocent souls of pure, developing boys.

I themselves.

consistently, and that is why they come
down the hardest on fraternities who get
caught for hazing. Nationals are truly
deplorable organizations who use the
argument of adulthood development to
milk money from chapters and fundraise
money that really should be going to
educational or charitable organizations.
Their only real value added is serving
as a risk management institution, which
schools are already better at handling
If Nationals were to be
wiped off the face of the Earth, the only
negative result would be the loss of some
erroneous jobs. So, why do they stay in
power? Because they argue that they are
the ones dictating the correct policies for

Since guys can only handle one task at a time, they

save rush for the fun part of being a bro and reserve

pledgeship for the hard part of being a bro.

Michael Kimmel’s book Guyland is the
essential sociological study of males in
between I6 and 26. Kimmel interviewed
hundreds of college students, and devel-
oped his own theory of pledgeship and
why it’s perverse. Luckily, he shares the
same view that most adults do, and that
is why his book is one of the most ac-
curate and detailed pieces of shit I have
ever read. This is because despite pin-
ning down the adolescent male’s life
experience down to the last detail, he
fails to understand what the male is re-
ally about. His description of guys is like
someone who tells you that “Inception”
is a movie about dreams. He’s just miss-
ing the point.

And so, what is so wrong with his ‘de-
scription of pledgeship? Essentially, his
and every other argument posed by most
adults is that pledgeship is a college
male’s way of making boys into men.
The reason pledgeship is so perverse is
that the frat stars aren’t men yet them-
selves, so their test of manhood has no
basis in reality, and therefore, no merits.
When it comes down to it, most adults
use this form of reasoning. They tell
freshmen that the older frat stars telling
them what to do don’t really have the au-
thority to boss them around because they
aren’t all that old themselves.

It doesn’t help that other adults at-
test to the idea that pledgeship is about
turning boys into men. National frater-
nity organizations use this argument

turning boys into men, thereby legiti-
mizing their version of pledgeship and
making it easy to kick off chapters who
don’t follow their policies. However, if
you look at their policies and outlook on
life, they are basically Mormons, which
is why SVU doesn’t need fraternities.
But I still haven’t gotten to what is
wrong with Kimmel’s argument. It’s an
incorrect deﬁnition. Pledgeship, at least
how it’s practiced at W&L now, isn’t
about turning boys into men. We aren’t
bringing freshmen to Brooks Brothers
and making them purchase “How to be
a Gentleman” because we are not inter-
ested in that aspect of the society. Our
idea of being a man is taking a shot
without a chaser and jumping into the
Maury in January, so it’s not like we
actually think that contributes anything
to real manhood. Furthermore, fratemi-
ties aren’t adult producing institutions.
That isn’t their purpose, no matter how
many pledge manuals you read. There
is no emphasis on adulthood in most
fraternities at W&L, so how is the goal
of pledgeship to make boys into adults?
And if the adults think I just proved their
point, what frat stars are claiming that
fraternities are bastions of adulthood?
Fraternities are just organized bro cir-
cles. I would use friendship circles but‘
that sounds way too effeminate and is
therefore designated for sororities, which
I will get to later. The point of pledge-
ship is to prove that your newfound bros

will stick with you through thick and
thin. Simply put, it’s an organized way
of guys collectively asking select fresh-
men 50 Cent’s “2l Questions.”

College boys are simple folk. They
just want to ﬁnd bros and hang out with
them. Until the Investment Bank Phase
(yeah, I’m referencing my own article),
guys don’t care too much about aca-
demics, and they don’t particularly like
showing their outward affection for
women in public, even though they ob-
viously enjoy their company. Fratemi-
ties are guys’ way of hanging out with
each other at W&L. Princeton has eating
clubs. Yale has colleges. Harvard is evil.
And W&L has fraternities.

So where do freshmen come in? Well,
W&L guys for the most part believe
that most of their fraternity brothers are
their bros. Obviously, there is some in-
ner fraternity dissention, but the reason
fraternities still have merit here is that
W&L guys believe that their fraternity
members are their bros. When they get to
campus, freshmen are not yet anyone’s
bros because frat stars and freshmen
have yet to kick it together. So, because
guys are stupid, they spend an entire year
going through the mating ritual of test-
ing whether or not select freshmen are
their bros. Rush is the glorious process
of frat stars collectively saying, “Look
how awesome it is being my bro.” It’s
a fun time for everyone because being
bros is a fun experience. That’s why dur-
ing late nights at every rush date, there
is a frat star going up to some freshman
and saying something that sounds like,
“I love you, Bro Montana.”

But then, why is there a need for
pledgeship? Can’t we just do it like the
girls do? No, because (breaking news)
girls are different. For girls, the discov-
ery of friendship is always a two-sided
coin. Girls don’t separate the simultane-
ous enjoyment and difﬁculty of being
someone’s friend. They don’t need a
pledgeship to test their future friends be-
cause girls are smart enough to both sell
girls on themselves and decidediwhether
or not they should buy the freshman’s
proposed friendship. This is why the
level of mental commotion that goes on
during girl rush dates is always too much
for guys to handle.

Guys, on the other hand, heed pledge-
ship because they need to show the
freshmen, their future bros, that being
someone’s friend is not only fun, but it is
also very hard. Since guys can only han-
dle one task at a time, they save rush for
the fun part of being a bro and reserve
pledgeship for the hard part of being a

bro. All pledgeship is currently at W&L
is a bunch of frat stars collectively asking
select future bros, “If I was stuck out at
Pink Palace, would you take the time to
sober drive me back home?” It’s done in
an organized fashion, but that’s basically
the gist of it. Depending on the fratemi-
ty, the demands for what constitutes how
far a bro will go to be your bro varies,
but that’s how differing friendships work
in the ﬁrst place. Some guys will literally
get your back in all circumstances, and
others will only get your back only when
the times are good. Pledgeship deciphers
which bro ﬁt into which category under
the assumption that life is always better
and manageable when you know who
you are dealing with.

The problem with this whole process
is when the bromance becomes negative.
Frat stars don’t like ﬁnding out that their
newfound bros only liked them for the
free beer. Frat stars are sensitive beings,
and they don’t like feeling used. Like-
wise, freshmen don’t like being taken
advantage of (use whatever deﬁnition
you want for “take advantage of”) as
fellow bros. Think about it, how many
times have you stopped being friends
with someone because ultimately, the
times you spend having to serve their
needs instead of yours gets to be a little
too much. When freshmen decide that
the frat stars weren’t really their bros to
begin with, that’s when parents start ﬁnd-
ing out and sending letters to deans. And
ultimately, that’s the frat star’s problem,
not the freshmen’s because you can’t be
someone’s bro if you’re always being a
f***ing dick to them all the time.

However, this does not mean pledge-
ship is not necessary. Every guy needs
bros who will help him when he needs
help. Pledgeship is the process of ﬁnd-
ing those bros. People in general put
their friends through different forms of
W&L’s pledgeship all the time. As long
as frat stars and freshmen are willing to
put in some effort in order to develop
the bromance and that system is not hor-
riﬁcally abused, then W&L’s pledgeship
should continue unabated but monitored,
like it currently is. If you don’t want the
structured process of ﬁnding a bro, then
go to a NESCAC school where fresh-_
men aren’t respected and bromances are
harder to come by. I like it this way, and
that’s why I came to this school, even
though I haven’t been able to say why
until now.

for navigating a successful Spring Term.
It may be your best month ofthe year.

1. The class you pick. This is abso-
lutely crucial. Some classes are very
very hard, and some are very easy. It
is hard to tell from the syllabus. Guess
carefully. I took an English course, got
an A, and never had to read a book. It all
depends...

2. On that note, do not take a lab. I
have not personally experienced it, but
I hear it is absolutely killer. Imagine
spending ten extra hours a week dissect-
ing a sheep’s brain when you could be
having fun with everyone else. A

3. Class can be a real blast. Focusing
on one subject is novel. As sophomore
Jeromey Mann puts it, one class “makes
you focus and gives you more freedom
to choose how to spend your time.”

4. The weather. It is so beautiful here
during the spring. There’s sunshine ev-
erywhere. I highly suggest tanning on
the Colonnade. (Fun, but a little awk-
ward when your profs walk by).

of sunshine and beer.

serves its own category. No more dark

Schwartz cook-

study room, which he had converted into
a fully functional living space - complete
with an air mattress, Xbox game system,
mini refrigerator, stereo set, and EZvboy
recliner - just over the course of the past
few years.

“I was in middle of shelving books
for the 900 section when I suddenly
heard Wiz Khalifa coming from a
study ofﬁce,” said Gameva. “At ﬁrst, I
thought I was going insane, but then I
smelled the ramen. That’s when I knew

something was up.”

By using her nose to detect the source
of the smell, Gameva was able to de-
termine the exact location of the room.
She knocked on the door, and after three
minutes of no-response, kicked it down.
The sight was astonishing.

“I could not believe my eyes. There
was this guy walking around in his box-
ers and blasting ‘Black and Yellow,’ like

run, and I’m happy with it. Can’t say I
have any regrets.” ‘

According to Schwartz, he moved
into the library exactly three years ago,
while studying for midterms during
Reading Days of his freshman year.

“It had been kind of a gradual thing,”
he said. “I had been doing work in the
library before that, but then exams hit,
and I basically started living there.”

8. Free food everywhere. I don’t
know why, but something about Spring
Term makes the school think we need
to be fattened up. Look out for Sweet

pieces of furniture and various stashes of
food. Once that happened, the transition
was complete.

“I had everything I needed: my books,
a bed, Call of Duty, snacks, music, a
laptop, clothes, you name it. What else
could I possibly want?” said Schwartz,
who has managed to maintain a vibrant
academic and social life throughout the
past three years.

According to economics professor,
Paul Soley, Schwartz was a model stu-
dent in his 300—level course.

“John was a stellar scholar in every
sense of the word,” said Soley. “He
always emailed me his assignments on
time and consistently went above and
beyond the requirements. His work was
so outstanding that I could overlook the
fact the he never showed up to my class.”

Outside of class, Schwartz continued
to maintain strong relationships with his
peers.

“John is one of the friendliest guys
I know. He waves to me every time I
see him at the library, which, now that I
think about it, is every single time I go
there,” said Junior Sarah Martinson. “He

10. The crazyness. People tend to go
a little cray cray. First-years realize it is
their last few weeks to be freshmen. In a
few months, they have to be grown-up
upperclassmen! Better get all those little
indiscretions out of the way now. Se-
niors, on the other hand, have nothing to
lose. That’s where the fun really starts. . ..

11. Oh yes, did I mention the 5th
week of Spring Term? If at all possible,
stay through the week for graduation.
Your internship can wait. You have no
cares in the world, only sunshine and se-
nior-fueled parties to attend. Fun times.

Have I sold it? I certainly hope so. So
even if you didn’t get into that Brazil-
ecology-beach program, even if you
won’t be promoting international peace
or saving the world, you can still have a
great Spring Term— right here in Lex.
And, I would argue, the best Spring
Term. So here’s to ﬂoating down the
river, Derby Days, and partying in the
sunshine. See you there.

to always be there!
What a coincidence, huh?”
Schwartz also managed to have a
steady, long-distance relationship with
senior Helen Sweeney, his girlfriend of
two years, whom he met while checking
out a DVD at the library one aftemoon.
“I tell people we’re in a long-distance
relationship, but we’re technically only
300 feet away from each other,” said
Sweeney. “We mostly Skype and text,
but whenever we do meet up, it’s always
in the library. I think it’s so romantic,
because that is where we ﬁrst met.”
After a. series of interrogations and
counseling sessions, Schwartz moved
into a Woods Creek apartment last
Thursday. ‘
“It was great seeing the sun again,
but I’ve had so many great memories in
the library and I’m really going to miss
it. I feel like I’ve spent half my life liv-
ing in there,” he said.

ColumnistAli Greenberg explains when what is “right” is not right

 I am, undeniably,
a total liberal. I go
in and out of phases
where I like to pre-
tend I am some ﬂow-
 er child from the six-

ties, or Penny Lane

   
   

0 following a band
' around the country
and leaving a trail of
patchouli.

This means that I
I am quite left of cen-

ter, and social issues

tend to hold more
importance to me than ﬁscal ones. Universal
healthcare, legalizing marijuana, repealing
DADT, closing down Guantanamo—I am all
for it.

However, just because I am a Democrat
does not mean I am always 100% pleased with
our president or his government, and I do not
believe that Obama has been always been en-
tirely correct or efficient with all his choices
and policies (or sometimes lack of policies).

There are areas in which I am frankly dis-
appointed with our president’s inaction and I
had hoped that our government would have
come through on some big promises they
made that have not been fulﬁlled. I am sick of
hearing about change, and I am ready to see it.

Yet, through thick and thin, I will stand by
my man. I believe in the platform Obama ran
on and I believe that for the majority of this
term he has earnestly tried to deliver. Things
are sometimes simply easier said than done.

So while I could go on about a dozen hot
button topics, I am respecting my word count
limitation and am picking just one that I be-
lieve needs an imperative change: the legaliza-
tion of same-sex marriage and the increasing
of gay rights.

While we made incredible progress with
the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” there
is still much work to be done on the front of
marriage equality and true equality across the
spectrum of sexual and gender orientation.
Progress in this ﬁght is especially difﬁcult to

achieve since this is a topic our president has
sometimes shied away from, openly saying he
is not a proponent of legalizing gay marriage,
yet is not against the potential for civil unions
with similar legal rights.

I do not treat this issue with as much mod-
eration as our president and believe that in
twenty years we are going to look back and
won’t understand how we managed to success-

ple is made up of.

Marriage inequality is a dark mark on the
history of the United States. There is some-
thing to be said when our peer countries like
the United Kingdom, Norway, Portugal, South
Africa, Spain, Sweden, Canada, France and
Germany (among others) all recognize same-
sex marriages, civil unions or domestic part-
nerships with legal rights, and yet the United

In twenty years we are going to look back and won ’t under-

stand how we managed to successfully segregate an entire

community without reason

fully segregate an entire community without
reason. Denying basic rights such as marriage
to a perfectly law-abiding subset ofAmerican
society is inexcusable and unjust, and this is a
lesson we have learned time and time again.

So while over I5 individual states have
stepped up and passed laws recognizing same-
sex marriage, civil unions or domestic partner-
ships, these relationships are not recognized
by the federal government and are essentially
null and void ifthe couple moves to a state that
does not recognize their union.

According to the Human Rights Cam-
paign, “Because same-sex couples are denied
the right to marry, same-sex couples and their
families are denied access to the more than
1,138 federal rights, protections and responsi-
bilities automatically granted to married het-
erosexual couples.”

These rights range from the ability to make
emergency medical decisions for your partner
to receiving health insurance beneﬁts gener-
ally granted to an opposite-sex spouse, among
others. These are rights heterosexual couples
take for granted.

At the end of the day, this is a moral is-
sue, but not the kind that the religious zeal-
ots would like you to believe. Regardless of
whether marriage, in the Bible, is a sacred act
between a man and a woman, the legal rights
of that recognized union need to be extended
to all couples regardless of what sexes the cou-

States, who is supposed to be at the forefront
of all things democratic, doesn’t take a stand
for what is right.

So how does this fit in to the upcoming
election? Four of the candidates for the GOP
nomination have openly shown their oppo-
sition to gay marriage. Mitt Romney, Rick
Perry, Michelle Bachman and Rick Santorum
have all signed the National Organization for
Marriage Pledge that afﬁrms that if they are
elected they will “promise to defend DOMA
(Defense of Marriage Act), support a consti-
tutional amendment to protect marriage (be-
tween 21 man and a woman), appoint judges
who will be faithful to the Constitution, and
protect the religious liberty of marriage sup-
porters.”

While I would love for us to get the predic-

tion right come February, I dearly hope that ’

the incumbent wins regardless of the GOP
nominee. The election of one of these candi-
dates guarantees a huge blow to the ﬁght to
legalize gay marriage in the U.S.

With state after state stepping up and mak-
ing actual progress, it would be a shame to see
another four years go by without Federal ac-
tion, and that means you too, Barry. It is time
to see positive action forward with this issue;
we need to ﬁght for it instead of against it.

And to end with a joke: Everyone should
have the legal right to marry, and subsequently
divorce, whoever they please. But seriously.

What’s hap enin’ in art World

Current events prove that artists are as quir

By Ryan Johnson
5 TA F F w R 1 T E R

The visual art world is a quirky, self-
perpetuating place. It is sometimes dif-
ﬁcult to understand and always impos-
sible to predict. What follows is a quick
outline of some eccentric people and no-
table events in the current scene.

Polish artist Roman Opalka wanted
to paint every number to inﬁnity. He
reached 5,607,249 before he passed
away in August. Opalka would paint
all the numbers he could in horizontal
rows on a canvas and then move to the
next one, each background progressively
lighter than the last. His project began in
1965 with the number I. From 1968 on-
ward he spoke each number into a tape
recorder as he painted it. Opalka intend-
ed his artwork to be an exercise in futil-
ity. He succeeded in that goal by failing
to reach inﬁnity.

Female artist Marni Kotak gave birth
to a boy inside the NYC Microscope
Gallery before about 20 gallery visitors.
Kotak delivered nine-pound Ajax Oct.
25 in the culmination of a performance
art piece titled “The Birth of Baby X.”
The artist used this unconventional piece
to challenge the taboos of childbirth by
treating it as a work of art. In the weeks
leading up to the actual birth, Kotak
spent her time in the gallery chatting

with visitors about childbirth and art.
The gallery installed a bedroom for her
to stay in and for the child birth to take
place. A video of the birth will be added
to the gallery installation.

The upcoming Green Box Project
promises to deliver a 2lst-century per-
spective on art. The project involves
about a thousand green boxes, each 6.5
cubic feet, which will be spread globally
throughout cities. When viewers use a
special app and point their smartphones
at the box, a piece of art, fashion, music,
or design will be revealed. The promot-
ers herald these augmented reality works
as a new art form. This is a chance for
hundreds of artists to interact with the
public sphere like never before. For
some viewers it will be an adventure to
view as many boxes as possible. For oth-
ers, or those without smartphones, there
is the exciting possibility of seeing green
boxes everywhere.

Chinese artist Ai Weiwei still has the
art community in an uproar. Ai, an art-
ist, architect, and journalist, created an
international furor with his political ac-
tivism in repressive China. The trouble
began several years ago. Ai helped de-
sign the Bird’s Nest stadium for the Bei-
jing Olympics, but was openly critical of

the lavishness the host nation displayed
during the ceremonies. Through his
blog and artwork he became a powerful
dissenter in the country. After suffer-
ing police brutality and intense govem-
ment scrutiny, Ai was arrested April 3
under ambiguous charges. Outraged at
this repression of free speech, the art
world (and diplomacy in general) rallied
around his cause through ofﬁcial state-
ments and websites like “Free Weiwei.”
On June 22 he was released, but hit with
a $2 million tax evasion charge and rigid
bail restrictions. Unfortunately for the
Chinese government, he now has more
inﬁuence than ever. Art Review maga-
zine named him the most powerful art-.
ist of the year, and Ai currently has over
108,000 Twitter followers, more than
twice as many as any other living artist.
The institution of art is by no means
invincible to the weak economy. Art
museums, which operate with the help
of private, corporate, state, and federal
funds, have felt the consequences of
budget deﬁcits. Private philanthropy is
being redirected towards the “essential”
aspects of the social sphere. State and
federal governments have received in-
creased pressure to focus funds on key
institutions like welfare or education.

Corporations that once provided steady
endowments are going out of business or
reducing their donations.

At the Cooper Union, an elite art,
architecture, and engineering school, ﬁ-
nancial stress is causing turmoil among
the faculty and students. Through a gift
by ‘Andrew Carnegie and through proﬁts
from its real estate holdings, the school
has traditionally offered a full scholar-
ship to every student who attends. But
the new school president has considered
charging full-time students a tuition fee
in light of budget shortfalls. The man-
agement has been unclear as to what
these prices will be and who will have
to pay. Frustrated by the lack of institu-
tional openness and angry at the possible
price hikes, students in all three schools
walked out and had class outside.

Financial restlessness extends to the
market prices for art, which have ﬂuctu-
ated over the last year. Established art-
ists, like Picasso, Johns, and Warhol tend
to always sell high, while lesser-known
ﬁgures, like Larry Rivers, Eric Fischl
and Francesco Clemente, have seen a
drop in prices. A resurgence of interest
in the Arte Povera movement of postwar
Italy has been followed by a surge in
market prices for that era of art.

and unpredictable as always, from live births and inﬁnite numbers

Two pieces by an artist of the time,
Alberto Burri, recently sold for more
than $8 million combined. A Land-
scape by Gustav Klimt, a traditionally
expensive artist, was sold on Novem-
ber 3 for $40.4 million. Who has the
money for this? Well, Sandra Bullock’s
son, Louis Bardo, is the new owner of
a notable Andy Warhol print, “Peaches.”
Bullock’s agents _bought it for him as a
gift, and one-year-old Louis probably
thanked them by drooling on it.

The much-anticipated “Paciﬁc Stan-
dard Time” initiative is upon us. A de-
cade in the making, this massive event,
organized by the Getty Foundation and
Getty Research Institute, brings togeth-
er more than sixty cultural institutions
in southern California to celebrate the
1945-1980 L.A. art- scene. It involves
several hundred exhibitions and events
throughout the area. “Paciﬁc Standard
Time,” which began in October and will
run through April of next year, is sure
to be a common topic of conversation
throughout art blogs and magazines un-
til then.

Students join music pros in special orchestra

The University—Shenana’oah Symphony Orchestra allows W&L students to perform with profession musicians

By Colleen Moore
STAFF wmrrn

Last Saturday night, the Universi-
ty-Shenandoah Symphony Orchestra
(USSO) welcomed a full house in Wil-
son Hall.

USSO is a semi-professional orches-
tra in which professional musicians from
Harrisonburg, Charlottesville, Roanoke
and Blacksburg play with local residents,

   

advanced W&L students and professors.
Under the instruction of conductor Barry
Kolman, the orchestra practices every
Thursday night for two hours. They pre-
pare for a concert in Nov. and Feb. as
well as holiday concerts in Dec.‘and a
Holocaust Remembrance concert in the
spring (done with the wind ensemble

and choir‘ groups).

The orchestra was challenged to play
several classical pieces they had never
played before. The ﬁrst half of the con-
cert consisted of a piece by the composer
Nielson and another by Ariaga. In the
second half, they played a Mozart piano
concerto with the help of Professor Tim

Gaylard who stepped in last minute to
play the piano. He received a standing
ovation. ~

Cellist MaryAnne Vardaman enjoys
rehearsals and concerts with the USSO.

“The orchestra is great because it
gives students an opportunity to come
together and play music with their peers

and professors,” she said. “It is a unique
experience learning a piece with other
musicians and then being able to per-
form it just a few weeks later!”

I described in a previous column how improbable it was for
the Cardinals to even be in the World Series. And now seeing
them win the whole thing makes me think I’m really dreaming.
They played (and Tony LaRussa managed) a hell of a series,
but I still think the Rangers did more to lose that series than the
Cardinals did to win it.

The St. Louis Cardinals: team of destiny?

For a team that was battling with Pittsburgh (I) for second
place in the NL Central for most ofthe first half of the season,
they certainly are unlikely champions. But an unlikely cham-
pion is a champion nonetheless.

If the Rangers had forfeited the World Series, or if Josh
Hamilton, Nelson Cruz, and Mike Napoli had all been stricken

The last three innings of Game 6 will get all the blame as
the worst played innings for the Rangers in this series—-and they
very well may be. Yet if we look closer, there is evidence of
other advantages that Texas managed to squander in this World
Series. ‘ .

The Rangers had a lot of things going for them coming out
of an ALCS victory over the Tigers: a fresher bullpen, extra
motivation from losing the Series the year before, and a slew

So, did the Cardinals actually win this year’s
World Series or did the Rangers lose it?
Stephen and Alex give their takes, what’s

with a mysterious illness, then maybe that would qualify as
the Rangers “losing” the World Series instead ofthe Cardinals
winning it.

To say that the Rangers lost the World Series makes it sound
like they just gift wrapped four wins for the Cardinals. That
certainly is not the case. It trivializes the fact that St. Louis cur-

‘rently reigns as the best baseball team in the Major Leagues.

of players from that 2010 team with World Series experience.

For me, Game 3 in Texas represents the first signs of the Rangers’ ability to collapse. I under-
stand that being in the American League, the Rangers’ pitching staff rarely gets to face Albert
Pujols, but they probably should have done what smart teams consistently try to do——pitch
around him. Just do not ever give him good pitches to hit; I don’t care what the score or situ-
ation is. In Game 3, the Rangers gave him at least ﬁve good pitches to hit, and he hit three of
them a combined 1275 feet. I had always known that pitching was a soft spot for the Rangers,
but I was worried it would soon become a sinkhole. Again, 1 don’t want to take anything away
from Albert Pujols—-he’s as good a player as there is in baseball--but you just don’t throw him
fastballs down the middle.

In Game 6, the Cardinals were down to their last strike TWICE. Looking at the numbers,
David Freese’s ﬁrst career at—bat against Neftali Feliz produced one of the most improbable
and memorable moments of the season. In his career, Feliz has limited opposing hitters to
a .125 batting average after a 1-2 count, which is the count Freese had when he smashed a
triple over Nelson Cruz’s head to tie the game in the 9th. Feliz has converted on 88% of save
chances in his career; that may sound like a B+ to us students, but that’s pretty darned good
when you’re trying to get Major League hitters out. I’m essentially asking how does this Feliz
98 mph fastball get hit hard by a guy in his ﬁrst World Series who has only 667 career plate
appearances? I ‘

Speaking of hot hitters, Cruz’s terrible range in right ﬁeld killed Texas throughout the
playoffs. And even if he hadn’t hurt his groin earlier in the game, I still don’t think he makes
that catch.

In the 10th, Scott Feldman’s frisbee to Lance Berkman was shot into center ﬁeld to tie it in
the tenth and the series was essentially over. Well...not really, but how can we expect Texas
to regain any momentum on the road after seeing their lead fall apart two innings in a row?
I don’t know what qualiﬁes as a curse word for Josh Hamilton, but he probably said it when
the bottom of the 10th ended in a tie. The end of that inning is when the Rangers’ team men-
tality appeared to sink for good, causing Game 6 to end on a walk-off by F reese and perhaps
explaining why Texas played ﬂat for most of Game 7..

When teams choke like the Rangers did leading up to Game 7, and subsequently lose all of
their momentum, that remaining game is virtually meaningless. Anyone following the series
knew who was going to win, especially when the Cardinals threw Chris Carpenter out on the
mound to seal the deal. But Carpenter didn’t do it all by himself; the Rangers helped him all.

series in ending their season.

A fan of Texas would certainly disagree with me. Not once
but twice, the Rangers were one strike away from wrapping it
up in game six. They were caught stealing far too often. Their ace relievers Alexei Ogando
and Neftali Feliz, who throttled Detroit in the ALCS, looked exceedingly mortal against
the Cards.

But in all of those instances, St. Louis had to make plays to capitalize on the Rangers
mistakes. Yadier Molina, the best defensive catcher in the game, still had to rocket the ball
down to second to stop the Rangers from advancing, even if it was questionable to steal in
the ﬁrst place. Neftali Feliz, former Rookie of the year and owner of an 100-mile—per-hour
heater, can have a rocky ninth inning in game six, but David Freese still had to hit a rapidly
moving round ball with a round bat for a game-tying triple.

I guess what I’m saying is that I hatepthe phrase “we lost it” as opposed to admitting be-
ing beat. The Rangers did not forfeit. They competed. They wanted to win just as badly as
the Cardinals did. ltjust didn’t work out for them.

Yes, they made some errors and had some base running mistakes. Yes, they blew two
saves in game six. But they had another shot in game seven to win it all and couldn’t do it.
The Cardinals beat them. They made the Rangers pay for their mistakes.

lt’s too bad that this is even an argument because it takes away from St. Louis’s moment.
This is a team that stormed back in September from an 8.5 game deﬁcit to Atlanta for the
National League wild card to sneak into the playoffs. This is a team that knocked the Phila-
delphia Phillies, the prohibitive favorite to win it all, out of the playoffs in the ﬁrst round.
They bested Milwaukee’s powerful sluggers Prince Fielder and Ryan Braun in round two
to earn a berth in the World Series. And they cooled off the red hot Rangers to seal the deal.

The 2011 Cardinals should be remembered for Chris Carpenter outdueling Roy Halla-
day to defeat the Phillies, Albert Pujols channeling his inner Reggie Jackson and launch-
ing three home runs in game three of the World Series, and for little known David Freese
winning the World Series MVP award thanks to his .348 average and walk-off home run in
game six.

The Cardinals won the World Series. They are going to the White House. They are get-
ting championship rings.

The Rangers wanted all those things too. They just came up a little short to a better team.

50 years ago in its Nov. 6, 1961 issue, Sports Illustrated ran a story on the football program at

' Washington and Lee, written by Walter Bingham. The Phi wanted to run it again.

A Sport For Gentlemen ,

At Washington and Lee University, deep in the heart of the Confederacy,
football is a winning game even though it is played purely for fun

Standing shoulder to shoulder with the
undefeated football teams of the nation#
Michigan State, Alabama, Texas,Mississippi,
Colorado and Ohio State—is Washington and
Lee, which last Saturday won its fifth game
of the season by beating Emory and Henry
27-6. While naturally proud of its record,
students at Washington and Lee are quick—
even happy—to admit that their team is not
in the same class with those other undefeat-
ed teams. At Washingtonand Lee football is
strictly amateur. No athletic scholarships are
given, nor have any been given for the past
seven years, a decision which at the time it
was taken brought screams of protest from
ardent alumni. But this year’s team, made up
purely of students who play football rather
than football players who study, is proving
that winning football on an unsubsidized ba-
sis can be as much fun to play and as exciting
to watch as any football anywhere.

Washington and Lee, of course, is not the
only college to have abandoned big-time foot-
ball. The University of Chicago, in perhaps
the most famous instance of de-emphasis,
dropped football completely in 1940 after 44
years in the Big Ten. Carnegie Tech, a football
power of the ‘20s, toned down its schedule
in 1936, just as Johns Hopkins (SI, Dec. 5)
had done the year before. Santa Clara, which
twice played in the Sugar Bowl and once in
the Orange, withdrew from national compe-
tition in 1952, although it has been creeping
back quietly during the past two years. Of all
the schools that have in varying degrees de-
emphasized their football programs and kept
them that way,Washington and Lee, which
has not lost a game since 1959, has been the
most successful.

Washington and Lee University is located
in Lcxing- ton, Virginia, deep
in Civil War
Country, a
school of red
brick
ings fronted by
white columns. The grounds are hilly and

crowded with giant elms. Reminders of the_

Civil War and its Southern heroes are ev-
erywhere. Robert E. Lee is buried on cam-
pus. Stonewall Jackson lies not far away in
the Stonewall Jackson Memorial Cemetery.

. There is a Robert E. Lee Hotel, a Robert E.

Lee Church and a Stonewall Jackson Hospi-
tal. No university ofﬁce is considered prop-
erly furnished without a portrait of Lee.

Washington and Lee is a gentleman’s uni-
versity. Coats and ties must be worn in class.
When one student passes another on campus,
it is customary for both to say hello. The
honor system prevails, and violators are dis-
ciplined by the students themselves.

It was‘ partly to preserve this reputation
that the university decided in 1954 to secede
from big-time football. The 1950 team had
been a powerhouse, winning eight of its 10
games, being ranked 15th in the country and
going to the Gator Bowl. To maintain its emi-
nence in competition with larger schools like
Tennessee, Maryland, Navy andAlabama,
Washington and Lee had offered athletic
scholarships to boys who, in the words of one
university professor, “were not Washington
and Lee types.”

When the football teams of the next three
years did poorly, causing alumni to press for

even more athletic scholarships, the time for a '

policy decision was at hand. The football pro-
gram was costing the university a great deal
of money. The football players, on the whole,
were proving scholastically inferior. Still, it
is possible that the Board of Trustees might
haveyielded to the pressure of the alumni
had not a large portion of the football team
been caught cheating during the ﬁnal exams
of 1954. Somehow they had made duplicate
keys to rooms where exams were kept and
had bought off the janitor. Those caught were
expelled immediately, but the feeling still ex-
ists that many more violators graduated be-
fore an investigation could be carried out.

A month later the Board of Trustees an-
nounced that Washington and Lee would
award no more athletic scholarships and

that the football schedule for that fall would
be canceled. When the university resumed
varsity football the next season, 1955, it
was against teams like Sewanee, Centre and
Hampden-Sydney.

It was a lean season. The team lost all its
games and scored only four touchdowns. In
one game it gained only three yards. “No one
covered our games,” says Frank Parsons, the
university’s sports publicity man. “It was
lonely in the press box. Just the P.A. announc-
er, a statistician and me.”

It was lonely in the stands, too. What few
people would come to watch a game usually
left at halftime for the warmth of the fraterni-
ty house and the big game on national televi-
sion. “It took guts to watch our games,” says
one professor.

Not many boys turned out for football that
ﬁrst season of unsubsidized football. During
practice one afternoon Boyd Williams, an as-
sistant coach, told all the ends to follow him
down to a corner of the ﬁeld. Williams trot-
ted to the appointed spot and when he turned
around found that he was being followed by
only one man.

The pressure to return to big-time foot-
ball increased after the winless 1955 season.
Campus polls favored it. “The students were
embarrassed to have schools like Hampden-
Sydney as opponents,” says one faculty mem-
ber.

One professor took his daughter to a den-
tist on a Saturday in 1955. “His waiting room
was crowded with children," he recalls, “but
when he saw me hetook me aside and started
arguing that Washington and Lee just had to
return to big-time’ football. He got so worked
up over it I decided right then not to let him
work on my kids teeth anymore.”

The weakest link

 ll 1 I <0 W 1%/\Cl<

A lo- cal columnist urged
the university to give up football entirely.
“If a football team is to be a link between a
school and its alumni, it had better be a stron-
ger link than the 1955 Washington and Lee
team.” Many inﬂuential alumni, through the
press, seconded the motion. “They were like
a bunch of kids who had their little red wagon
taken away,” said a former player recently.

After Washington and Lee won only one
game in 1956, Coach Bill Chipley was ﬁred.
“It was a ticklish situation,” says one faculty
member. “It didn’t look too good, ﬁring the
coach just after we had de-emphasized.” The
official statement released by the university
explained that Chipley had been let go be-
cause he was not “a good teacher of football.”

In his place the university hired Lee
McLaughlin, a solidly built man in his late
30s with a grin as wide as his shoulders. When
he held his ﬁrst football meeting, less than 20
boys showed up. “It had become fashionable
not to play football,” says Frank Parsons.
“Boys used to say, T was great in prep school‘,
but I wouldn’t play here.’ “

“People used to come up to me and say,
‘lsn’t it a shame that so-and-so hasn’t "come
out for football,” McLaughlin says. “I’d tell
them maybe, but I don’t think so-and-so
could make our team. I knew we couldn’t get
anywhere until we stopped making heroes out
of boys who didn’t want to play.”

McLaughlin traveled about looking for
football players, although he could not, of
course, offer anything more than a good edu-
cation. He covered New England, concentrat-
ing on Connecticut. “Many of our boys come
from prep schools,” he says. “You can’t throw
a rock in Connecticut without hitting a prep
school.” McLaughlin used to get depressed
when prospective Washington and Lee foot-
ball players were lured away by athletic
scholarships. “I’ve gotten used to it now,” he
says. “Recruiting is like selling insurance. If
you see a thousand boys, maybe you get 10.”

What Washington and Lee liked best
about Lee McLaughlin ‘is the way he ac-
cepted the de-emphasized football program.

He held a spring practice, but it was only for
two weeks in February so that the boys were
free to go out for spring sports. Daily work-
outs in the fall were only an hour and a half,
and if a boy could not make practice because
of studies, McLaughlin understood. In fact,
several times he ordered boys not to show up
for practice because he knew they had impor-
tant tests coming up. He held a weekly skull
session, an hour every Monday night. If the
session ran past the hour, McLaughlin told his
boys that they were free to leave.
McLaughlin’s ﬁrst two seasons were no
better than Chipley’s, but in that second year
many of the boys who form the foundation
of this year’s ﬁne team arrived on the Wash-
ington and Lee campus. One was Terry Fohs,
the 145-pound linebacker who consistently

leads the team in tackles. “One of the reasons"

I came to Washington and Lee is that I knew I
could make the team,” he says.

A Quarterback Steve Suttle had no intention
of playing college football. McLaughlin in-
vited him out to watch a practice session one
day. “When I saw that the players weren’t a
bunch of goons,” says Suttle, “I changed my
mind.” Suttle also went back to his dormitory
and talked his friend Ned Hobbs into trying
out. Hobbs became the right end and is now
a captain of the team. Jerry Hyatt had never
played football before he entered Washing-
tonand Lee, because his high school in Mary-
land had no team. Hyatt tried out anyway,
made the team and is now an outstanding
center. .

In 1959 the team won three games, one
more than it had won.the previous four sea-
sons. And last yearWashington and Lee was
undefeated, being tied only by Johns Hop-
kins. With each victory the howls of the

alumni to return to big-time football

diminished and interest

V in the team grew. Once

again people showed up to

.I watchwashington and Lee

play football, and if most

of them still left at half time occasionally it

was because the team was winning by such
big scores, not losing. -

This year’s team, after barely winning its
ﬁrst game against Hampden-Sydney 7-6, has
scored 148 points in its next four games to its
opponents’ 12. There have been no outstand-
ing stars, although Fohs, the little linebacker,
has again led.the defense. A dozen players
have scored touchdowns for Washington and
Lee. In last week’s victory over Emory and
Henry, for instance, the four touchdowns
were made by four different men. Coach
McLaughlin generally uses most of his 50-
odd players, not because he is kind but be-
cause the talent is evenly distributed.Wash-
ington and Lee uses a running game, passing
only when necessary. “When you pass,” says
McLaughlin, “three things can happen and
only one of them is good.”

The resurgence of football at Washington
and Lee has created a new worry among uni-
versity officials. At the close of last season
there were a few moments when it looked
as if the school might lose McLaughlin. Vir-
ginia was looking for a new football coach
and McLaughlin had graduated from there
in 1941. But McLaughlin, if he got an offer,
turned it down and now says he has no inten-
tion of ever leaving.

“I have the best coachingjob in the world,”
he says. “I have the rank of associate profes-
sor, tenure and extra beneﬁts. This is a nice
town, a ﬁne place to live. And I work with
nice boys.”

McLaughlin recently gave a small party
for some of the faculty. One of the guests was
Dana Swan, a young man who in his ﬁrst sea-
son as coach of the freshman team has had
the unhappy experience of watching his team
lose every game. In fact, the team has yet to
score a touchdown.

As the guests were leaving, McLaughlin
came over smilingly to Swan’s young wife.
“You’ve probably heard already,” he said,
“but in case you haven’t, your husband is do-
ing a ﬁne job.” At Washington and Lee, even
the football coach is a gentleman.

By Allie Weiss

STAFF WRITER

Reformed international conman
Frank Abagnale will pay a visit to Wash-
ington and Lee Tuesday, Nov. 15.

Abagnale’s name is one that many as-
sociate with success. The fonner conman
now divides his time between delivering
lectures worth $27,000 to the institutions
that hire him and working closely with
the FBI. He owns a company on which
more than 14,000 organizations rely to
protect them from the dangers of fraud.
He has also published four books, one of
which was turned into a ﬁlm by Steven
Spielberg.

But his is also a name that went un-
used during an infamous period of his
life, replaced by aliases and seated atop
federal lists of wanted criminals. With
the name comes the story of one '
of the world’s most brilliant
and elusive conmen.

According to Abagnale,
when he was 16 years old,
he was taken out of school
and driven to a courthouse.
There, a judge asked him to
choose which of

 
   
   
   
 
   
    
 
 
   
 
  
 
  
   

from that day on. Up until that point, he
hadn’t even known they were getting a
divorce.

Abagnale ﬂed the courtroom. Over
the next ﬁve years, he accrued an esti-

mated $2.5 million, over $15 million in

today’s world.

During his years on the run, Abagnale
worked as a Pan Am pilot, a pediatrician,
a lawyer in the state attorney general’s
oﬁice, a stock broker, and a FBI agent.
By the time he could drink, he’d seen
eighty six countries and ﬂown more
than one million miles for free. And he’d
done all of it without even ﬁnishing the
tenth grade.

In a recent interview with Fox News,
Abagnale described his ﬁrst scam,
which he carried out using his
, father’s credit card. “I would
-. simply go around to the gas sta-
tion and I would say to the gas
"V  station attendant that I’d like
four tires. And he’d take them
down off the rack and I’d give
him the credit card. He’d call it
in and get an approval, and then

his two he’d get ready to put them on.
parents I said, ‘Tell you what. I re-
he’d ally don’t want those
like to tires, so I’ll sell you
live those 4 tires back
with for $100 cash.

You’ll get the

  
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
  
  
 

money from Mo-
bile, you keep the
tires, I get a hun-
dred dollars [to]
take the girls out.’”
“I think I was
just very creative,”
Abagnale said in
that same interview.
“It wasn’t that I was

brilliant, I was just very_much an entre-
preneur. I saw things that other people
didn’t see. Isaw weaknesses by observ-
ing things that other people probably
paid no attention-to.” 1
Among Abagnale’s many cons, per-
haps one of the most cunning was the
time he opened a bank account with his
last $100, and ﬁnished the week 400
times richer. As he was leaving the bank
after opening his account, he picked up
a stack of blank deposit slips. The next

day, he wrote his account number on all ~

of the slips using the same type of mag-
netic ink that banks used. He put the
slips back in the lobby of the bank, and
everyone who used them that day was
effectively depositing their checks into
Abagnale’s new account. He withdrew
$40,000 that same day and walked away
scot-free.

In an interview with PM Magazine in
1980, Abagnale described how he made
his way into the state attorney general’s
ofﬁce. “When I was about nineteen years
old, I came to Baton Rouge and 1 ap-
plied to take the bar. I presented a phony
transcript from Harvard and told them I
was 28 years old, and a ‘law graduate. I
took the bar the first time. ﬁunked it. The
second time, ﬂunked it. The third time, I
passed it, and was licensed by the state,
and not only became a lawyer, but an ad-
ministrative aid in the attorney general’s
ofﬁce, where I practiced law for about a
year.”

When he was 21 years old, Abag-
nale settled for a short time in Montpel-
lier, France. Not too long afterwards, an
Air-France stewardess recognized his
picture on a wanted poster, and told the
French police where he was living. He
was brought to trial in France, convicted,
and spent six months in a French prison.

During his time there, where he was re-
ported to have been held without inter-
ruption in a dark cell and given access to
neither toilets nor a mattress, Abagnale
stated in an interview with Don Tennant,
“The truth is, as harsh as the French pris-
ons were, I thought they were the most
effective ofall. No one ever came in and
beat me up or physically abused me, but
what they were literally saying is, ‘You
don’t know how to live in society, so
we’re going to take you out of society.
You acted like an animal, so we’re going
to treat you like an animal. We’re going
to put you in this box, and you can think
about what you did.’” This he compared
to his time spent in an American prison.
“I played miniature golf, I watched mov-
ies on the weekend, I had the best of
food. Someone took care of every need
I had—medical, dental. It wasn’t a bad
life,” Abagnale said.

However, despite such pampering,
Abagnale accepted the offer that came
from the government when he was 26,
4 years into the 12-year sentence that
he’d been given after his extradition to
America. He would be released on- pa-
role under two conditions. The ﬁrst was
that he move to Houston. Texas. The
second was that he serve the remainder
of his sentence helping the government
solve crimes related to forgery and coun-
terfeiting.

After prison, he took small jobs,_but
was always ﬁred once his employers
discovered his status as a convicted con-
man. Finally, he approached a bank staff
and offered to demonstrate the tricks that
scam artists use so that the bank could
avoid being subject to them in the future.
If the staff found his expertise useful,
they would owe him $500 and a recom-
mendation. Both parties ended up ben-

against the dangers of fraud. ,  . "

Abagnale eventually founded Abag-
nale & Associates, a company dedicated
to such a service, as well as authored
several books detailing common tricks
of the conman’s trade. One of these
books, Catch Me if You Can, was made
into a ﬁlm featuring Leonardo DiCaprio
and Tom Hanks.

“I would be lying ifl said it wasn’t
fun,” Abagnalehas said. “I would be ly-
ing if I said it wasn’t an incredible life
that I have lived.”

Today, after having worked for more
than 35 years with the federal govern-
ment, Abagnale lives with his wife and
three sons. His oldest son is currently an
agent with the FBI. Upon being asked
about his son’s choice to join the very
organization that had hunted Abagnale
throughout the l960’s, he replied, “At 63
years old, I will never experience again
what was the proudest moment of my
life when my son crossedthe stage at the
FBI Academy and became an FBI agent.
He’s in the 6th year at the Bureau and
living his dream.”

When PM Magazine asked if he was
reformed, Abagnale replied, “No, just
retired. I decided to take all the talents
I had, and just redirect them in a very
positive way and do something positive
with my life.”

The Contact Committee, W&L’s
student-run organization dedicated to
bringing remarkable people to campus,
is hosting Frank Abagnale at 7:30 p.m.

rival, students are welcome to see Catch

Campus Kitchens gives back

Hunger and Homelessness Week raises awareness

By Neil Haggerty
COPY EDITOR

The Washington and Lee Campus Kitchen and Na-
bors Service League are localizing their efforts to help
deal with problem hunger and homelessness through this
week’s Thanksgiving Turkeypalooza and Hunger and

Homelessness Week.

“The goal is to ensure each of our clients gets to enjoy
a Thanksgiving meal,” said Jenny Davidson, coordinator

of student service-leaming.

The Turkeypalooza is a national program for all Cam-
pus Kitchens. The W&L group will bring Thanksgiving
meals to local clients including Glasgow Concerned Citi-
zens, Habitat for Humanity homeowners, Magnolia Cen-
ter, Rockbridge Area Occupational Center, the Manor at
Natural Bridge and the Lexington Ofﬁce on Youth.

These Thanksgiving meals include individual meals
for homeowners as well as congregation meals, where the
Campus Kitchen volunteers are able to enjoy a mealwith

their clients and their clients’ families.

“My favorite part of Turkeypalooza is meeting some

Yadlin said a lot of extra volunteer shifts have been
added for the Turkeypalooza, in order for people to get
a chance to work with the Campus Kitchen.

“These meals mean a lot to the people...it is

Winkler warns of technology

Bloomberg editor—in—chief addresses the 52nd ethics institute; technology is good he says, as long as its not a crutch

By Logan Nardo
STAFF wmrea

Technology is good for the joumal-
ism industry as long as it doesn’t become
a crutch, says Matt Winkler, Editor-in-
Chief of Bloomberg News.

Winkler delivered this message dur-
ing his keynote address, titled “Truth in
the Age ofTwitter_,” during the ﬁfty-sec-
ond Journalism Ethics Institute Friday,
Nov. 11 in Stackhouse Theater.

Winkler’s speech centered on the ac-
tions he has taken at Bloomberg News
to be sure the business does not publish
any inaccurate stories. For Winkler, the
focus on accuracy at Bloomberg cannot

falter because they serve “those with the

_ most at stake.” Bloomberg news gives

many Wall Street brokers the latest ﬁ-
nancial news from around the world.

According to Winkler, Bloomberg fo-
cuses on the ﬁve “F’s.” Being the most
factual word is ﬁrst, but they also must
have the ﬁrst word, the fastest word, the
ﬁnal word and the future word.

“I don’t think any news organiza-
tion today can succeed without the ﬁve,
‘F’s,’” said Winkler. “I don’t think it’s
possible.”

Winkler said that he knows they can-

not always have the absolute ﬁrst word,
or the absolute deepest coverage, but
they are the best at always doing all ﬁve
well.

Winkler says Bloomberg has “report-
ers operating in... a very traditional way
when doing the best journalism as we
know it is actually enhanced by technol-
ogy, not diminished by it.” ,

There was a time, Winkler said, when
anything published was factually veri-
ﬁed, edited and ﬁnally released to the
public. Now, he says, that time is passed.

Today, people can publish their every

thought on a matter online. He referred
to today’s media as a “freefall of sponta-
neous expression.” Anyone can publish
anything they want and it is accessible
to the globe.

Ed Wasserman, Washington and
Lee’s Knight professor of ethics called
Bloomberg to be a bright spotin the
journalism industry.

“At a time when the news busi-
ness has splintered into various mutant
forms mixing celebrity gossip, opinion,
crowd based aggregation, thinly sourced
reports of indeterminate reliability,

Bloomberg under Matthew Winkler has
ﬁercely insisted on standards of accura-
cy and reliability that are the strictest in
the industry,” said Wasserman,

Winkler closed his speech with a sim-
ple quote from Mark Twain "‘A lie will
travel halfway around the world before
the truth laces its shoes.” According to
Winkler, Bloomberg is doing its best to
counter that.

Students learn to network

Career services holds program for mulitcultural students, as part of an eﬂort intiated by

By Drew Carlos
STAFF wmrea

Networking is beneﬁcial to all stu-
dents, but the key is to know how to do
it right. On Saturday, Career Services
offered a program to teach students just
that.

The ﬁrst ofﬁcial “Building Profes-
sional Networks: Connecting Washing-
ton and Lee’s Multicultural Alumni and
Students” was held Saturday Nov. 12.
The program was aimed at the multicul-
tural sector of W&L.

Beverly Lorig, director of Career
Services, called the program a “joy” to
plan. Everything began, she said, with a

conversation with alumni Mike Webb,
who wanted to make this event happen.
Webb, Lorig said, was the main person
who helped in “keeping this event alive.”

William Toles, ’92, gave the keynote
address. His speech focused on maxi-
mizing the W&L experience.

He said even though going to W&L is
a sacriﬁce, there are plenty of opportuni-
ties to make the place special, because,
Toles said, it is a special place.

Toles advised students to get involved
on campus, reach out to alumni and help
with student recruitment. By doing all

of these things, Toles said, students can
maximize their time on campus and get
involved more. “To get involved, get in-
volved,” Toles said.

After Toles’s speech, Dean Sydney
Evans talked about why students don’t
network. She said networking is not
normally perceived as a good thing,
which should not be the case. The only
thing students need to do is to get coin-
fonable with it, she said.

Dean Tammy Futrell said alumni are
here and want to contribute and help
students, but students have to put forth

the effort.

Lorig talked about the importance
of using the phone. In an age where ev-
ery form of communication is through
email, Twitter, Facebook and text mes-
saging, the current generation does not
necessarily use the phone to their advan-
tage, but Lorig said the purpose of the
program is to help the students develop
these skills. She told the students, and
the alumni agreed, you have to use the
phone to reach out.

After the keynote speaker, the stu-
dents broke off into groups focused on

alum Alike Webb

certain topics so they could have a one-
on-one conversation with the alumni and
ask them questions. The students were
given a choice to attend two breakout
sessions in the ﬁelds of Legal, Business,
Communications/Media, and Education/
Non-proﬁt/Healthcare.

President Ken Ruscio called it a
“great event” that allows students to
see how those who came before have
weighed the choices all undergraduate
students are about to face.

  . Reﬂections on the Real Madrid

Columnist Francesca Wilson describes how gender relations in Spain compare to those at W&L

 

1 During my
second week-
end in Spain, I
accompanied a
Spanish fam-
ily friend to a
posh soiree for
20-somethings
in Barrio Sala-
manca, Ma-
drid’s version of
the Upper East
Side. We ar-
rived around 11-
ll:30, Spanish
cocktail hour,
and I noticed upon my entry into the
apartment that there were no other girls.
There, surrounded by upwards of
20 “pijos” (yes, there’s a Spanish word
for preppy), decked out in their mono-
grammed Ralph Lauren oxfords and
Tod’s drivers, I acted as any well-adjust-

ed female abroad would: I politely prac-
ticed my espaﬁol while explaining why I
had decided to study abroad in Madrid. I
sat, perched on a settee for an hour chat-
tingaway (it was as ifthey’d never seen
blonde highlights), before any glamor-
ous “pijas” entered the apartment.

Immediately, the girls took up resi-
dence on the far end of the living room
and formed a tight little circle ofjust fe-
males. It was as if the girls were there
to be marveled from afar, like beauti-
ful, distant objects. And, for an hour or
so the group proceeded in this polarized
manner. I, of course, sat, thoroughly en-
tertained, feeling both fascinated and a
little bit like an international harlot from
all the quizzical stares I was receiving
from across the room.

Once the boys’ “gyntonics” ﬁnally
set in, they embarked on their mission
to conquer the seemingly impenetrable
wall of females. With signiﬁcant effort

and some crouching next to the girls, the
males began to break into the females’
circle. By the time my amusement had
turned to boredom, the “pijos” and “pi-
jas” were ﬁnally interacting.

It goes without saying that Washing-

“Patriarchal,” and quite honestly,
“parochial,” are possibly the best words
to describe the Spanish upper-middle
class of Madrid. Within this small, close-
knit society Catholicism and conserva-
tism reign supreme and given this envi-

ton and Lee has gender relations issues.
As a (relatively) newly co-educational
institution, it will still be many years
before the undertones of the “Good Old
Boy” that subtly persist will truly be cast
aside. Nevertheless, in my time at W&L,
I have never witnessed such awkward
tension between the sexes as I did during
my ﬁrst “pijo” gathering.

ronment, it is no surprise that the young
women of this society are hesitant to in-
teract with males. If girls are too forward
they are ridiculed through malicious gos-
sip that spreads within their social circle
thus sullying their reputation. . .how me-
dieval.

A few weeks ago, I was sipping on
a delicious “gyntonic” and chatting with

a “pijo” acquaintance when he conﬁded
in me that he doesn’t have any female
friends. For example, the concept of
going to get lunch with a girl that he
doesn’t have any romantic interest in is
practically ludicrous. In his world, boys
hang out with boys and girls hang out
with girls and they only mix in semi-
formal social gatherings. It was in this
conversation that I realized how much
I appreciate the male friends I’ve made
at W&L. Although, I despise certain
fraternity traditions, I feel that genuine
and equal friendships between men and
women can exist on our campus. While
I adore Spain for all of its beauty, I ﬁnd
myself continuously irked by the patri-
archal nature of the society. I am look-
ing forward to returning to a culture in
which women command a presence that
extends beyond physical beauty and ro-
mantic possibility.

Interested in dancing like a star?

Looking to impress that special someone at formal ? Columnist Brandyn Churc

For the past
two weeks,
students and
professors
alike have
been brush-
ing up on their
dance skills
in preparation
for last Sat-
urday’s Gala.
The recently
formed W&L
Ballroom,
coordinated
with profes-
sional dancer Edwin O. Roa, offered two
Swing workshops before the big night.
The workshops, which were held in the
Doremus Dance Studio, drew an average
of 25 participants each lesson. Partici-
pants learned a variety of basic steps and
styles; ranging from the Charleston to
Single-time and Triple-time Swing.

As the founder of W&L Ballroom, I
will now take this time to shamelessly
promote my club. I had been dancing for
a little over four years when I arrived at
W&L freshman year. There is not a huge

ballroom/social dancing community in
Lexington (hopefully that will change
soon), so I soon came into contact with
Dr. Melina Bell. While attending law
school at Boston University, Dr. Bell
started taking ballroom lessons; She then
proceeded to compete on the ballroom
teams at Tufts University and the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, while working
on her masters and PhD. After hearing

her stories about dancing in college, I —

decided that this was an experience that
could add value to any W&L student’s
college career. After a year of tossing
the idea around, I asked Dr. Bell if she
would serve as the club’s adviser, to
which she agreed.

Dancing is a fun activity and a life
skill. How often have you heard’ some-
one worry about not being able to dance?
I regularly receive requests, before for-
mals and other events, asking for a crash
course in “how to dance well enough that
I don’t look like an idiot in front of my
date.” The purpose of W&L Ballroom is
to develop and promote a social danc-
ing community at W&L. Social dancing
and ballroom dancing are very similar;
they tend to draw on the same moves and

styles. However, ballroom dancing tends
to imply a choreographed routine per-
formed at a competition (think “Dancing
with the Stars”), whereas social dancing
is what an individual would do if one
went out to a Salsa club. Social dancing
has room for ﬂexibility and expression,
in that there are no patterns or routines.
While we are certainly open to the idea
of competing, if students are interested,
the immediate goal is to get students ac-
quainted with theidea of partner danc-
ing.

We are fortunate because as we de-
cided to form the group we discovered
that Lexington has a professional ball-
room dancer in town two days a week.
Edwin O. Roa was born in Bogota, Co-
lumbia, and grew up experiencing the
nightclub scene. For the last seventeen
years, Roa has been formally study-
ing social and ballroom dance, and has
traveled across continents to further his
knowledge of partner dancing. Having
held a Salsa workshop for the Depart-
ment of Romance Languages, Roa was
thrilled with the opportunity to offer
additional workshops at W&L. As we
continue, throughout the year, Roa will

Infant Legislators Debate Abortion

Representatives

government policy.

Debate became heated while the bill
was in utero, resulting in tears, squirm-
ing and occasional kicking between op-
posing sides ofthe fallopian tube parties.
The leftist Crybaby Party was divided
between more radical Screamers, and
moderate Blue Puppies.

Screamers, like California Embryon-
ic Rep. Maxine Vitro-Waters, argued that
it is a sacred constitutional right for an
infant to abort his or her parents should
he not be ready to interact with them, es-
pecially since the mother is biologically
proven to be a part of an infant’s body
and shares blood and nutrition.

Blue Puppies like “Fighting-Joe”

or life of the infant, the infant has a right
to a parental abortion. Baby representa-
tives cited cases of drug abuse during
pregnancy, and whether said parents
were considering taking on an abortion
themselves.

Polls showed that more liberal babies
tended to come from more liberal con-
stituent parents, while conservatives al-

involved

edged that although infant science has
yet to ‘prove at what point parents feel

ers respond to fetal movements), should

most always came from aconsewative
parental district.

Conservative Neonatal-cons and the
Religious Right opposed such measures,
blaming biotech lobbyists, hungry for
harvestable stem cells, for inﬂuencing

their fetal opponents from across the am-
niotic sack. Conservatives maintain that
a parent’s right to life is sacred from the
moment of fertilization, and that this is-
sue would not be considered, if parents
were not disenfranchised demographics
in infant Congress. Neonatal-con Fox
News journalist and former Presidential
candidate, Mike Huckababy, publically
denounced the bill.

Other measures discussed during
debate were whether or not the same
rights applied should a child decide to
euthanize aged parents regardless of
health, dubbed “Pull the Plug on Par-
ents Clause.” Another measure, called
the “Deadbeat Dad Clause” would allow
an egg, while still in the ovary, to inﬂu-
ence eugenic thought in their mother.
Yet much milk drinking between par-
ties formed a consensus, and these items
were tabled until alter birth and elemen-
tary schooling.

The ﬁnal legislative obstacle is the

Tiny-Tot Senate, where the bill could
go either way because of a tenuous lib-
eral majority with a large faction of Blue
Puppies. President Barack Obaby has
come out in favor of parental abortion
reform, brieﬂy holding a press confer-
ence and then quickly returning to ﬂying
around the country holding high-dollar
fundraising dinners.

Neonatal opposition is gearing up for
the ﬁght. Conservative senatorial tykes
threatened to ﬁlibuster. A leak poses the
possibility that diapers may be involved.
On top of this, conservative govemesses
have established a coalition to bring the
law before the infant Supreme Court,
where Ruth Baby-Ginsberg is the only
staunch proponent of the bill. If the bill
is nurtured successfully, the new Paren-
tal Abortion Act (Jr.) will be due some-
time next month.

Testing Tebowing: does it really work?

subjects like a bad economy.

Tebow, as an NFL quarterback, cer-
tainly doesn’t have to worry about his
own economy. His multi-million dol-
lar contract takes care of that. Yet while
many would probably choose to spend
this wealth indulging every minute of
their free time purchasing the perfect
cars, houses, vacations, yachts, and
trophy wife (s?), Tim Tebow has a dif-
ferent mission. He is out to evangelize
the world. No, really. Tebow, the son
of strict evangelical missionaries who
homeschooled him through high school,
takes his Christian faith to a whole new
level. He may play professional football,
but off time he visits prisons,» goes on

missionary trips to the Phillipines and
prays.

Tim Tebow is famous for his praying,
especially when he prays and in what
position he prays. He is famous for get-
ting down on one knee, ﬁst on forehead,
and praying at the most inoportunte mo-
ments (aka, during crucial periods of a
football game). During the overtime of
the Broncos improbable win against the
Dolphins, while all his fellow players
were freaking out, Tebow was “Tebow-
ing.” That is the official name that has
been given to this action. It has sparked
quite a following. Originally started by
teenager Jared Kleinstein with a picture
posted on Facebook, it has grown into a

franchise. There is the official website,
where fans can post pictures of them-
selves “Tebowing” (the toddler and dog
pictures are especially epic), T-Shirts,
XouTube videos, and much more. It’s
like planking, but way cooler.

This led me to try it. As if my life
weren’t interesting enough as it is, I de-
cided it was time to embarass myself.
I tried it ﬁrst in the Coop. Sitting with
people around a table, I suddenly got
down on one knee ---and then realized:
I didn’t know how long you were sup-
posed to “Tebow.” I decided one second
was enough and quickly got back up to
explain to my friends that I was not, in-
deed, crazy.

Next I tried somewhere a little more
adventerous. Wednesday night. The cab-
ins. Middle of the dance ﬂoor. This was a
bit of a fail, as everyone simply thought
I had drunk too much and --- slipped or
something? Oh well, still counts.

Suffice to say, Tebowing is fun.
No matter what you think of the guy,
whether a freak, a weirdo homeschooler,
an overrated quarterback, or all of the
above, you have to admit he spices up
the NFL. So if you feel inspired, snap
a pic and post it to tebowingcom. And
who knows, maybe one day soon Pres-
Pres Obama will appear on there too ---
Tebowing along with the best of them.

who may distract you and what you may
ﬁnd yourself doing when work takes you
longer than expected.

People who may distract you:

Your crush-

There is nothing more distracting than
having the boy you like sit next to you when
you have a lot of work. You will probably
be consumed by how your proﬁle looks, or
how adorable it is that he tears up when he
reads “Romeo and Juliet.” We all struggle
with this.

There are a couple of scenarios that can
happen that will make the experience worse.

Scenario: He walks in when you are eat-
ing something that cannot be eaten graceful-
ly, such as a banana. Even Kate Middleton
could not chew a banana without it sound-
ing disgusting.

Scenario: You have a cold and are either
snifﬂing or blowing your nose the entire
time. Who wants to make out with someone
who is sick? Ew, not I.

Scenario: Your friend walks up and with-
out realizing that said crush is sitting next

- to you, says, “Well I saw you ﬂirting with

[crush’s name] last night. I know you two
will totally hook soon!” Urr.

The girl who can’t take hints—

Sometimes I think that there is a sign on
my back that says, “If you want to complain
about work or talk about nothing, talk to
me.” My study spot is the Mecca for fraz-
zled students.

You probably have had a few run-ins
with these creatures; the ones who spend
their nights moving from one innocent
victim to the nexticomplaining about how
much they have to do. If only they were as
good at doing work as they were choosing
people who want to hear about their prob-

lems the least, they may get something ac-»

complished.

The two nerds attempting to ﬂirt—

Resist the opportunity to offer advice to
the challenged individuals. It can sometimes
take a lot of will power not to say, “Girl,
stop cracking your knuckles and yawning
when you have nothing to say. Boy, stop
avoiding eye contact and saying ‘frat.’ You
sound like a tool.”

If only I could do this, the couple may
decide to spend time together somewhere
other than the library. And then, I could fo-
cus again.

The ice chewer- I can’t think ofa more
obnoxious sound. Tell the iron-deﬁcient
cruncher to pipe down.

Mr. Hungry- We all love the smell of

specialty fries, except for when we can’t eat
them! Unless you are willing to share, keep
the fries at Co-op. Studies show that eating
while you work will cause you to consume
more.

The texter who refuses to turn off his

The person who listens to headphones

parently it is.

times result in wasted time and last-minute
stress, they make studying a lot more enter-
taining. I mean, would you really want to go
to the library if no one was there? (If yes,
check out Leybum on a Wednesday night).

brary will allow you ﬁve undisturbed hours
of work, think again.

Mock C

on Gala right on!

The event marks the halfway point between Spring Kick— ]? and the actual Mock Convention in February

By Neil Haggerty
copv EDITOR

Students danced the night away this
Saturday at the Mock Convention’s
Presidential Gala. It only happens every
four years; once in every Washington
and Lee student’s college experience.

With about 1,700 students participat-
ing in this event, the Presidential Gala
brought all parties together for a night to
remember.

According to social committee chair
Victoria Mercer in a promotional video

for the Gala, “The Presidential Gala is
sort of a spin-off of the Presidential In-
augural Ball. It sort of marks the half-
way point between Spring Kick-Off and
the actual Mock Convention in Febru-
ary.”

“It’s primarily a fundraising event,
on the scale of Fancy Dress, designed
to bring the undergraduate and law stu-
dents, faculty, alumni parents and lead-
ers of the Lexington community togeth-

er,” said Kelli Jarrell, Mock Convention
Communications Chair.

After many state delegations joined
together at parties in preparation for the
Gala, students came together and wore
formal attire in black ties and cowboy
boots, an idea sparked by the theme of
George W. Bush’s Inaugural Ball.

The full package for this election’s
Gala included tickets for t-shirts, tervis
tumblers, stemless wine glasses, a low-

ball cocktail glass, and a cork screw all
in theme of W&L’s Republican Mock
Convention. For students ages 21 and
over, there was a beer and wine garden
addition at the Gala.

In the promotional video, Tricia
King, the general chair of Mock Con,
said that she is excited for all of the
students involved in the convention to
“own the convention as their own,” since
participation in the event has increased

from the 150 students involved in Mock
Con at the time of Spring Kickoff.

“Spring Kickoff did a great job of
bringing the students body together with
the leaders of the Lexington Community
and Fancy Dress is a rare opportunity to
interact with professors outside of the
classroom. The Gala serves both these
purposes and since it only happens once
every four years, you know we’re going
to do it big,” said Jarrell.

Registration and WebAdVisor woes

Many students woke up early to beat the 7 a. m.

By Cynthia Lam
5 TA F F w R I T E R

Just like cramming for midterrns and
gaining the Freshman 15, registering for
courses is one of the many rites of pas-
sage every W&L student experiences.
For some people, however, the stress of
securing the perfect schedule is nearly as
nerve-wracking as getting a date for the
Presidential Gala.

Winter course registration ofﬁcially
opened at seven a.m. on Nov. 1, allowing
students to select two classes for the up-
coming terrn, with staggered dates giv-
ing special preference to upperclassmen.
While this system generally worked for
seniors, juniors, and sophomores, it gen-
erated feelings of anxiety and concern
among many freshmen.

“My main worry was that most of

. level

the classes I wanted would be full either
because most of the upperclassman had
taken it, or they had, like, three spots or
less left,” said ﬁrst-year Julia Lang. “It
was like a race, two of my hall mates ac-
tually went to the library at 6:30 a.m. to
make sure that they would have a good
intemet connection, because that one
second can make all the difference.”

The competition for introductory-
classes was especially ﬁerce
among science majors and students on
the pre-med track.

Said ﬁrst-year Grace Lee: “There
were very, very few spots for the entire
Chemistry ll2 section, and all the stu-
dents were trying to get in at the same
time. Like everyone else, I woke up half

an hour before registration happened,
because I knew that it was the only
hope of getting the two classes I wanted.
Even though I clicked “register”.at 7 am,
I didn’t get into either of them. It was
really concerning that I didn’t get into a
chemistry class, because I want to be a
biochemistry major.”

This conﬂict was resolved later that
morning, however, when the department
head sent an email to all the Chemistry
lll students, explaining that they had
reserved spaces for current students and
they were committed to ﬁnding a spot
for everyone in Chemistry 112.

“It all worked out,” said Lee.

Other freshmen experienced simi-
larly stressful situations, often due to

unforeseen consequences.

Said ﬁrst-year Matthew Moore, “I
timed it down on the atomic clock that
I had pulled up, so I waited until it was
6:59 am and 58 seconds, and then I
pressed “register” at what I thought was
exactly 7 o’clock, but I realized I had a
business oﬁice hold because my mom
hadn’t paid off my $40 swipe home.”

“My heart just dropped,” added
Moore. “I had to wait until it opened at
8:00 am, call them, have the hold lifted,
and then I registered for what was left.”

“I feel like it was better when we
all had different times to register, just
because it wasn’t a mad rush of people
all trying to register at the same time,”
said Lang. “WebAdvisor is a good thing;

deadline and struggled securing the few slots in primetime class times

there’s just some technical diﬁiculties
that need to be worked out.”

Under the old system, registration
times used to be staggered for each stu-
dent. *

According to sophomore Kelsey Mc-
Clary, course registration becomes less
stressful once students declare their ma-
jor.

“As a freshman, you have to ﬁnish
the rest of your FDRS, but once you
know what you want to do, you can actu-
ally focus on the classes you want,” said
McClary. “I think that this is the fairest
way to do it; I can’t think of a system
that would be more successful for every-
one to use.”

College Dems and Republicans go head-to-head

Mock Con sponsors a debate between the two politically motivated clubs, debaters will cover taxes, jobs and other issues

By James Biemiller
STA F F wn ITE R

Mock Convention 2012 will spon-
sor a debate between the W&L College
Democrats and College Republicans this
Thursday, Nov. 17 at 7 p.m. in Lee Cha-
pel.

Each team will consist of four mem-
bers. Half of the debate will feature pre-

« pared answers to questions distributed

beforehand to the teams. The other half
will be open for audience members to
ask questions of the teams.

Republican debate team members
include Tyler Grant, Tim McAleenan

Jr., Connor Perkins and Matt Simpson.
Democratic debate team members are
Robbie Day, Leah Gose, Zain Raza and
Todd Smith-Schoenwalder

Issues to be debated include taxes,
deﬁcit reduction, education, jobs, im-
migration, energy, and national security.

“It’s going to be both extremely in-
formative and entertaining. There are
some excellent individuals on both sides
of the debate who will make it fun while
providing insight on the ideologies and
policy perspectives of their respective

party,” said Perkins.

Team members have been preparing
their best arguments for weeks.

‘‘I read three newspapers a day,” said
Gose. “I’ve been trying to become a
little more well-read in the going—ons of
the House and Senate. I know the party
platform well, but I’ve been trying to
learn more about what’s going on in the
now, not the 2012.”

Both sides are conﬁdent in their abili-
ties to defend their positions.

“I think each side is going to be ﬁr-

ing on all cylinders in an effort to outdo
the other, and in the end it will just come
down to who can best convey their views
and their reasoning for those views,”
said Perkins.

About the outcome of the debate,
Gose said “Conﬁdence is key but arro-
gance is a downfall. . .I expect both sides
to give good opinions.”

“It’s great that we can have debates
like this and that people are open to hear-
ing ideas that aren’t their own. It shows
a growing tolerance on campus,” added

Gose.

Both organizations hope to see a
strong turnout to support their debate
members and learn about current politi-
cal issues.

“We’re on the cusp of becoming in-
formed voters and this is a good chance
for'students to hear both side of the ar-
gument and see W&L students express
their opinions,” said Gose.

  The Generals Have Gone Amateur .

On December 15, 1958, Sports Illustrated ran a story on W&L ’s basketball program. In honor of the basketball
seasons beginning this week, the Phi decided to run it again.

Written by Jeremiah Tax

In the hoopla surrounding the open-
ing ofthe college basketball season last ,
week, little attention was focused on a
game played in a small gym in Lexing-
ton, Va. before an audience of only 500.
Even the ﬁnal score excited few people
outside the state of Virginia, though
probably the longest-odds team any-
where in the nation that night had appar-
ently put on a remarkable performance.
The team was Washington and Lee, the
first group of “amateur” Generals since
the school dropped athletic subsidiza-
tion in 1954. Last spring, the few re-
maining holders of athletic scholarships
had been graduated, and W&L, rich in
traditions going back to 1749, looked
apprehensively to its athletic fortunes.
As is often the case, an appreciation of
the past illuminates these current events.

George Washington still contributes
$12 toward the education of every stu-
dent at Washington and Lee. The money
comes from the earnings of 100 shares
of stock in the James River Naviga-
tion Company, which Washington gave
to the school, then called Liberty Hall
Academy, in 1796. Grateful trustees
promptly changed its name to Washing-
ton College. More than half a century
later, after General Robert E. Lee had
served as president, his name was added
and the school became a university.

Today, a statue of Washington,
carved out of a single pine
log and thickly crusted
with layers of white
paint, stands atop

W&L’s oldest build-
ing and faces, across
campus, the simple,
sedate ex- A terior of Lee
Chapel, ,  ‘ designed and
built it‘ by the gen-
eral also as a gift

to the school.

Inside the
‘_ chapeh
"9" where Lee

and his family
are buried, is
the famous re-
cumbent marble
statue of

Lee,

 

ﬂanked by Confederate battle ﬁags—
still the goal ofthousands of tourists.
For these and other visitors there
is much else to please the eye on this
picture-book campus tucked into’ a
hilly, wooded corner of Virginia’s lush
Shenandoah Valley. It is a friendly place;
the stranger is greeted warnily by stu-
dents and faculty alike as he strolls the
ancient brick walks~a custom which
once brought the school a million-dollar
endowment and a new gymnasium. In
the early 1920s, a tourist from the North
was so impressed with the courtesy
shown him that he willed this sum and
provisions for a ﬁne athletic plant.

MANY SCHOOLS Now BIGGER

If only because of age, W&L has ac-
quired its host of social and academic
traditions~not the least of which is
a record of sports rivalry with other
southern schools that goes back to the
origins of intercollegiate competition.
Many of these schools, the universi-
ties of Virginia, Tennessee and Ken-
tucky, for example, have long
since outgrown W&L in both
size and athletic prowess.
Lee Chapel will still ac-
commodate nearly the
whole student body

(all male and

‘ less
than

1,000),
and W&L has
never enlarged its

scope beyond that of encom-
passing the liberal arts. There came,
inevitably, that summer day in I954
when W&L’s trustees were forced _to
make a decision about athletic policy;
they did, and students, alumni and fac-
ulty have been debating it heatedly ever
since. The decision to drop subsidiza-
tion meant, simply, no more scholar-
ships and competition that would elimi-
nate most, if not all, traditional rivals
while including others closer to the size
and athletic ambitions of W&L. It will

voices and petitions

condemning the poli-
cy continue to bom-

bard W&L’s
trustees.
Dr. Wil-
liam M.
Hin- ton,
chair-
man of
W&L’s ath-

letic committee,
professor of psy-
chology and education,
a rabid and knowledge-
able sports fan, explains

the administration‘s position
thus: ‘‘I’m a W&L man myself,
class of ‘29, and l’vc been on the
campus practically ever since. No one
is prouder ofour athletic traditions. But
it had been apparent for years that we
could no longer compete on our past
level, except at serious cost both aca-
demically and financially. The compe-
tition for good athletes had grown to
the point where, if you wanted to play
in our league, you had to accept some
boys who were poor academic risks.
At the same time, you were subsidiz-
ing boys who were poor or average
students, and were unable to offer help
to top-grade students. Each year the
cost grew bigger. Football got all the
money it needed, and the minor sports
had to be content with splitting up the
rest, often less than enough for adequate
equipment. We can't draw large, paying
crowds from the Lexington area, so we
were playing away from home, putting

  
 

on a show for strangers instead of our
own people. Some friends of mine say
we ought to drop intercollegiate compe-
tition altogether. I can’t agree. I like to
see those good-looking, hard-nose boys
who want to play football and basketball
and lacrosse walking around our cam-
pus. They add something important to
your student body. And we’ll continue
to get them. This year 80 boys turned
out for football, more than ever before,
even under subsidization. And we darn
near beat Sewanee, a good single-
wing team. All we need is a few
wins in a few sports and this furor
will die down. When I was a stu-
dent, we were already having trouble
in football, but we had a ﬁne wrestling
team. And our attitude was—if we
couldn’t beat the Wahoos in football, we
could at least wring their necks.”

ALUMNI STILL PROTEST

These views have thus far failed to
win over a substantial number of inﬂu-
ential alumni groups and at least a ma-
jority ofthe undergraduates, all ofwhom
ﬁnd it hard to accept such names as Se-
wanee, Wittenberg and Centre on W&L
sports schedules. The prevailing view of
this opposition is that a limited number
of athletic scholarships would still en-
able the school to compete against the
Virginias, VPIs and Richmonds. Prob-
ably the trustees are the realists. Today,
no school that offers 20 athletic schol-
arships can compete successfully for
long with another that offers 100. This
involves nojudgment ofthe morality of
athletic scholarships but a recognition
of the open-market bidding for athletes
Ofall kinds.

Nevertheless, when the Generals
opened their basketball season last week
with the very ﬁrst all-amateur team, still
playing a Southern Conference sched-
ule, the overwhelming undergraduate
sentiment was that W&L’s athletic tra-
ditions were being disgraced and that
the players, disgruntled themselves,
would fail to arouse any school spirit.
True enough, the team, to a man, was in
favor of some program of athletic schol-

arships, especially (understandably) for
basketball men. On the other hand, their
coach~crew-cut, earnest Bob McHen-
ry, only 24 years old and himself an
amateur starting his ﬁrst season—could
honestly say he was for the amateur pro-
gram: “Under subsidization, I wouldn’t
be the coach.”

Well, neither McHenry nor his play-
ers disgraced anyone. They faced a
strong William and Mary team, com-
posed almost wholly ofscholarship men,
three of whom were inches taller than
W&L’s biggest player, and they were
conceded little chance to put on even a
reasonably close game. But McHenry
had scouted William and Mary well and
was able to use his boys with maximum
strategic effect.

In the ﬁnal analysis, however, it was
the very quality they were supposed
neither to have nor evoke—spirit~that
proved their greatest asset. They hustled
endlessly, actually rebounded on even
terms with William and Mary despite
the vast difference in height. Under the
sure hand of Mal Lassman, their attack
was relentless and intelligent, rarely los-
ing the ball through amateurish errors.

At the end of regular time, the score
was 52 all. At the end of the ﬁrst ﬁve-
minute overtime period, it was 56 all.
They lost, ﬁnally, 63-60, never having
abandoned their poise, and to student
cheers such as have seldom greeted
winning W&L teams. Rather than dis-
gracing, they surely enhanced a proud
tradition.

George Washington, it appears, in-
vested that stock wisely.

I ill.lEXANl)l§l{ MARAGIIS

Job security in sports is almost exclusively measured on
wins and losses. This emphasis placed on the on-ﬁeld results
is most prominent in professional sports’, but it undoubtedly
trickles down to the amateur levels as well. For better or worse,
this straightforward barometer dictates nearly all personnel de-
cisions in the business of sports. Yet over the last week and
a half at Penn, State, job security was measured in something

  

HI-.',l‘...

S'l‘El’llE1 I PECK

  

Joe Paterno has been the head coach of the Penn State Nit-
tany Lions football team since 1966. He has amassed a Divi-
sion I record of 409 career wins. He has won two national
championships, is a College Football Hall of Famer, and has
even been a Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year. His list
of accolades is only rivaled in length by the list of stories of
Patemo affecting a person’s life positively.

considered foreign to modern athletics. This measurement is
neither new, nor complicated, but so oﬁen hidden from View
that its prominent re—inclusion into decisions at Penn St. almost
came as a shock.

What’s the measurement? Right and wrong.

Unfortunately, basing ‘decisions off of what is right and
wrong is usually implemented when something terribly wrong
has occurred, like the child abuse charges against former Penn
St. Defensive Coordinator Jerry Sandusky. It might be seldom

The colle e football world was rocked
last week w en allegations of child sexual
abuse came out against a former Penn State

. coach. Long time head coach Joe Patemo
was dismissed, leading many to ask, did the
school do the right thing by ﬁring him so
quickly?

Stephen and Alex give their takes.

But when faced with the opportunity of bringing a close
friend to justice for sexual assault, Paterno stood by.

Paterno is a legend. He is a titanic ﬁgure in college football
-and is revered like a god in Happy Valley. People listen to Joe
Paterno.

But when informed of the atrocities committed against a
young boy by former assistant Jerry Sandusky, Paterno shrunk.
It was a deciding moment in the life of the man known as Joe
Pa, and he failed.

According to the horrifying grand jury report, when in-

used, but thank God someone decided to apply it in Happy Val— A

ley. Right and wrong has the former President of Penn State Graham Spanier and several
other prominent former university officials looking for new jobs (and likely never ﬁnding
them). Right and wrong also has thousands of students from Penn St. organizing a candlelight
vigil on campus to show support for the victims of this sex-abuse scandal.

So where is Joe Patemo’s place on the right and wrong spectrum? Didn’t he do the right
thing? Well yes...and no. He reported once heir—apparent Sandusky’s alleged crimes to his
superiors, assuming they would be dealt with in the proper manner, and that’s it. Yes, that
was one of the right things to do. But it wasn’t enough in the eyes of The Pennsylvania State
University Board of Trustees or in the eyes of many in the general public. The board decided
that the best course of action was to -ﬁre the face of the school before he had the chance to
coach the Nittany Lions in what would have been his 549th game.

Two Saturdays ago, Patemo and the Nittany Lions defeated The University of Illinois 10-7
to place Patemo atop the all—time college football wins list--a truly remarkable accomplish-
ment in what was widely considered before the scandal to be his ﬁnal year on the sidelines.
His iconic career at Penn St. was ﬁlled with dozens of accolades that now appear hollow in
the wake of such a dark period in the school’s history. In the end, Patemo was ﬁred because
he didn’t do enough to stop the alleged abuse. I agree that he should have been ﬁred; he didn’t
do enough right to keep his job. Still, Patemo getting the ax before he had the chance to coach
the last home game of the season does not seem ﬁtting. He’s not accused of sexually abus-
ing anyone. I just don’t think that the punishment ﬁts the crime. He did not commit so much
wrong to warrant an immediate and graceless dismissal.

I say that PSU should let the man who has become the face of the university go out with
some deserved dignity. He has donated millions to the school and is consistently mentioned
as not only a molder of great football teams, but a molder of great men. Nearly all who have
played under him since his ﬁrst year 1966 admire his passion, leadership and integrity. So in
a situation caused by one man doing so much wrong, I think Penn St should have let “JoePa”
coach just one more game. It seems like the right thing to do.

formed by a graduate assistant that Sandusky was found mo-
lesting a young boy in the showers, Patemo simply reported it to the Athletic Director. Pa-
terno did his legal obligation, but not his moral obligation. He could have made one phone
call to the police. He cou1d’ve gone out of his way to bring Sandusky to justice. People
would have listened to Joe Paterno. But he did no such thing.

Perhaps he stayed relatively silent because Sandusky was a friend. But more frighten-
ing is the thought that he stayed silent because he wanted to keep Penn State competitive.
Perhaps he feared that if this news broke, his program would be shot to pieces. They would
lose recruits, scholarships, and precious sponsorship money and be a step behind other
programs. But ifvwe have got to the point as a society where the win-at-all-costs mentality
in college sports is chosen over reporting a sexual offender to the police, then the system is
broken and I fear for our future.

Sports are my escape. I idolize my athletic heroes and will schedule my day around
watching a game. But at the end ofthe day, that is all sports are. A game. So if college foot-
ball has become so competitive, so tainted, that all moral obligation to do what is right is
thrown out the window, then I want no part of it. As said by a few national pundits, I miss
the days where the worst thing we heard about was Jim Tressell turning a blind eye to his
players selling memorabilia.

It was right to ﬁre Paterno immediately, for the simple reason that he could have done
so much more. Paterno and Penn State covered for a monster instead. of bringing him to
justice. Instead of caring for the eight victims whose childhoods are ruined, who are perma-
nently scarred, they tried to protect one of their own. There is no way he should have been
allowed to ﬁnish out the season as the head coach of Penn State.

It’s a shame that such a tremendous coach, such a beloved ﬁgure at Penn State, and by
all accounts a wonderful person could leave in such disgrace. But it is ajust, albeit unfor-
tunate, punishment.

“I wish I had done more,” Patemo said when he stepped down last week.

I’m sure the victims do too.

and Kasoff followed her lead, coming
in second in 4:55.47. First—year Kate
Feeser came in third in 5:01.93.

In the 200 ﬂy, junior Delaney Rolfe
touched in ﬁrst in 2:18.12, while Hamp
and Hampton came in second and third
with times of 2:22.54 and 2:28.80, re-
spectively.

Fredericks had another winning
swim, capturing the 200 breast stroke
in 2:32.20, and Cassada took the 500

. free in 5:25.87. '

In the 100 free, Lawrence brought
home the win in 58.46, Hardy won the
50 free with a time of 26.21. Finishing
up the General’s wins of the day was
senior Elizabeth Stames, who took the
1000 free in 11:18.40.

The Generals will be back in the wa-
ter on Nov. 19, when they head to Cam-
egie Mellon. There, they will face CMU
and Allegheny beginning at 11:30 am.

Don’t get SAD, get healthy

Colder weather and ﬁnals stress can lead to “winter blues” or seasonal affective disorder

By Tilden Bowditch
STAFF warren

As the weather gets colder and
stress levels get higher, students might
ﬁnd themselves experiencing the win-
ter blues. ‘

People often mistake the winter
blues for Seasonal Affective Disorder,
a form of clinical depression that usu-
ally occurs in the fall and winter.

The shorter days and long, dark
nights of the winter season can cause
anyone to experience the winter blues.
Symptoms of the winter blues include
depression, tiredness, weight gain and
social withdrawal - not to mention
anxiety as ﬁnals and rush week loom
ahead.

Seasonal Affective Disorder, or
SAD, occurs when a person experi-
ences these symptoms intensely for
at least two consecutive weeks, says
Director of Health Services Dr. Jane»
Horton. According to Horton, students

prone to depression are more suscep-
tible to SAD.

Depression at Washington and Lee
University is not uncommon. In last
year’s National College Health As-
sessment, 35.6 percent of W&L stu-
dents reported feeling so depressed
it was difﬁcult to function at some
point during the year. Senior Lauren
Ashley Tipton, who runs student men-
tal health organization Active Minds,
says she notices student depression
more obviously during exam week
every year.

“People become so overwhelmed
with their work that any preexist-
ing tendencies towards depressive
thoughts are exasperated by the iso-
lation that one typically experiences
during exam week,” Tipton said.

Active Minds hosted a panel on
mental health Thursday, Dec. 1 in

Stackhouse. The panel consisted of
two staff members, one law student
and three undergraduate students who
spoke about their personal experienc-
es with mental health issues.

Topics discussed included depres-
sion, self-injury, relationship violence
and substance abuse. Staff member
Kelsey Goodwin shared about losing
a friend to suicide last year.

“It was really intense, powerful
stuff. I don’t think there was a dry eye
in the room,” Goodwin said.

This season, students might con-
sider being aware of their own well-
being as well as their. friends’. As
exam week draws closer, students
often sacriﬁce their physical health
for a few extra hours of studying. Dr.
Barongan, a clinical psychologist at
the University Counseling Center and
the Active Minds advisor, says pulling

an all-nighter actually hurts more than
it helps a student’s academic perfor-
mance.

“Yes, you have more time to study
but you’ll be working longer and
harder because you won’t work as ef-
ﬁciently,” Barongan said.

Instead, she suggests students take
the extra time to exercise, sleep, and
eat so when they do study, they’ll be
more productive.

Maintaining a daily routine and pri-
oritizing a healthy lifestyle is key for
battling seasonal depression, says Dr.
Horton. Horton says students should
prioritize eating well, exercising, and
sleeping at least 7 hours every night.

She also suggests an hour of light
exposure every day. Light therapy
boxes are available in all three cam-
pus libraries, including the science
and law libraries.

Are you ready for recruitment?

End of fall term signals beginning of formal recruitment for bothﬁrst years and upper classmen

By Leigh Dannhauser
STA F F WRITE R

As the fall term comes to a close, first
years and upper classmen alike are get-
ting ready for the excitement of fonnal
recruitment.

Here’s a breakdown of the rus pro-
cess on both sides.

Fraternity Rush

A few weeks ago all male potential
new members met with the lnterfrater-
nity Council. Each PNM ranked their top
six fraternities, out ofthe 14 total.

Each PMN will receive an invite
from four of the six houses that they
ranked in November. PNMS visit the
four houses over the span of two days.
They attend what are called rush parties.
On Tuesday and Wednesday PNMs can
only attend one rush party per house they
are invited to.

At this point houses can choose
whether or not to invite the PNM back to
the rush parties on Thursday and Friday.
Those receiving invites back to those
parties are automatically given a bid to
that house.

According to Clay Coleman, director
of Greek and resident life, this process
will not be affected too much by the larg-
er ﬁrst-year class. Only eight more boys
are registered to rush this year compared
to last year.

“I wouldn’t say it’s statistically sig-
niﬁcant,” says Coleman.

There are no caps or quota systems in
fraternity rush.

Coleman says that the golden rule in
the rush process is to respect other or-
ganizations. He says he expects honor,
integrity and civility during the rush pro-
cess.

“We’re a community that respect one
another,” Coleman says.

With Christmas Weekend just passing
there are not really any more opportuni-
ties for fraternities in terms of rushing.
Coleman says that this week is a dead
week with ﬁnals coming up, and then its
winter break.

Fraternity brothers can talk to PNMs
all the way up to through rush without

restrictions. Fraternity rush does not
have a no-contact period.

Sorority Rush

Sorority recruitment is much differ-
ent than fraternity recruitment.

Female PNMs do not rank the sorori-
ties before January. Also unlike frater-
nity rush, PNMS cannot talk to sorority
girls during winter break. This time pe-
riod is called no contact. This contin-
ues throughout rush week, except for at
night during rush.

On the first night of rush, PNMs go
to all six houses. Afterwards they head
to the D-Hall to rank the sororities. Girls
rank ﬁve sororities as their number one
and one sorority as their number two.

As the days of rush week pass,
PNMs can attend fewer and fewer
houses, which they are invited back to.
On Thursday PNMs can only visit two
houses and then on Friday they receive
their bids to one house.

Throughout the week the rush parties
that female PNMS attend get longer and

less frequent.

This year, with the larger ﬁrst-year
class there are more girls rushing. As
of last Thursday, there were 220 female
PNMs.

The large number of PNMs is just
one aspect as to how rush is different
this year.

“The large number of women reg-
istered will likely result in larger new
member classes,” says Katie Salvati,
Panhellenic council recruitment chair.
“We are excited that our sorority com-
munity continues to grow.”

The main difference to rush week of
2012 is that the Alpha Delta Pi house has
been completed. This year PNMs will
stay on sorority row during the night.
Last year ADPi had their rush parties in
Evans Dining Hall. A bus shuttled girls
from Evans to sorority row and back af-
ter each party had been completed.

“It is wonderful to have all of our
chapters recruiting out of a house on so-
rority row,” says Salvati.

This process can be stressful for some
girls.

Head Rho Gamma Alexandra Frazier
says that it should be a positive experi-
ence instead.

“Be honest with yourself, and pref-
erence the house where you best ﬁt in,”
Frazier said. “That may or may not be
where you thought you were going in
September, where your roommate is go-
ing, where you’re a legacy... but it will
be where you’re happiest for the next
three and a half years.”

For those who are overwhelmed by
the process, Rho Gammas are a valuable
resource. They have been through the
process already and give unbiased sup-
port. ‘

“They have training. They know
things,” says Frazier. “lt’s better to ask
a Rho Gamma directly if you have ques-
tions than to ask other PNMS.”

Shacking 101: a guide to a night out

Planning on spending the night out? Take a look at the top ten misconceptions and misdemeanors of sleepovers

 

ByTucker Willow
. co um N I sr

10. Kiss and Tell

It’s no secret that at a small school
every millisecond long DFM is a public
affair. After laughing aboutit with your
friends, you come up with a catchy nick-
name that successfully hides the identi-
ﬁcation of your hook-up from everyone
but your friends so you can publicly
discuss and harass them without being
outwardly rude. While childish and im-
mature, at least this method of sharing
your story saves some face. In general,
a classic, classy move of not kissing and
telling is preferable.

9. Hickeys

From cold spoons to unused tooth-
brushes, there are a million hilarious
quick ﬁxes every shacker has tried,
and failed, at least once. The “Vacuum
Hookup” is a classic source for social
embarrassment, and these people should
be publicly humiliated ten times over
for each of their victims. Your best bet
in hiding your Saturday night shack is to
rock a pashmina to class, but in the event
of a Lexington heat wave, I’d say do
your best to avoid the vacuum hookup.
Unless you want to look like you sur-
vived a bear attack.

8. Activity Volume

Everyone’s been on the wrong side of
a screamer. There’s nothing worse than
having to swallow your pride to stay
in and study... until you encounter an
over—enthused lover. Granted, the ﬁrst
20 seconds are hysterical once you re-
alize what’s going on, but after that it’s
just annoying. Congratulations on get-
ting laid,~I’ve got a voice recording of

what sounds like a murder on my phone
and you can bet I’ll be sharing it with
all of my closest friends. So please, keep
it down. That way everyone around you
gets a good night sleep - and you get to
keep your dignity.

7. IDing Your Victim, Location, etc.

There’s nothing quite like waking up
in a strange, unknown location...except
for waking up in a strange, unknown lo-
cation with a strange, unknown person
beside you. A common misdemeanor
in the shack attack is not remembering
every exact detail. It’s safe to say that if
you don’t at least know someonels ﬁrst
name, you probably shouldn’t be shar-
ing his/her bed. But never fear, not all
hope is lost. After ﬁnding your clothes
and phoning a friend for a ride home
(if your location is unknown just start
shouting that once they ﬁnd a car you
can get them an address), quickly sweep
the room for a wallet or swipe. This is
the easiest way to ﬁgure out whose room
youjust slept in. If you can’t ﬁnd an ID,
look for a phone. Check their latest texts,
calls, etc. to try and determine who it is.
This is a shot in the dark - maybe their
phone is locked, maybe they only put
contacts in their phone with ﬁrst names,
maybe they only talk to their mom...
who knows. So don’t rely on this one.
In a state of complete desperation, you
can always resort to photographic evi-
dence. This is best done while the victim
is still sleeping, but then you can utilize
your friends in IDing your shack. Do not
send this around—you will look like a
freak. At this point, hopefully your ride
is outside, but if not, be sure to book it
outside, there’s nothing worse than‘ an
awkward morning (see no. 5). Once out-
side, hopefully you will recognize your
surroundings and be able to inform your
driver where to get you. If not, hopefully
you’ve got an iPhone and you can just
try maps.

6. Sexile Island

Everyone’s worst fear entering col-
lege is the dreaded roommate. Will he be
an avid Dungeons and Dragons player‘?
Will she constantly black out and puke
in our room? Will they steal my shit? lt’s

a never-ending game you play of worst
case scenario until you Facebook stalk
them and discover they are at least mild-
ly normal looking. But you’re not free
yet — a good-looking roommate could
lead to the worst roommate of all: the
sexiler. For those who don’t pay atten-
tion to the outside world, a sexiler is a
cruel and unusual person who puts their
own sexual needs above the common
courtesy and respect for other human be-
ings. Maybe it’s been a long night out at

of the bed. The next series of events de-
pends on who you’re with but it all ends
the same — they’re trying to kiss you. As
appealing as a make out sounds while
you reek of Natty and shame and your
mouth is as dry as the Sahara, you’re just
not that into it. This misconception is all
too common, and a little hard to swallow
so let me just say it: Don’t try to relight
the ﬂame in the morning. Most likely
I’m ready to go home and shower, alone,
so please don’t touch me. And just be-

the poles, or maybe you’rejust returning
from a hard night’s study at the Leybs
when you ﬁnd the locked door. The
giggling from within taunts you as you
hopelessly knock and bang on the door
trying to gain entrance. You have been
sexiled. Once you’ve realized your mis-
fortune you have a few options:

1. Unlock the door. Immediately start
apologizing and pretending you had no
idea, but then refuse to leave and quickly
show the unwanted third party (as well
as your roommate if you so choose) the
door :

2. Sleepoverll Quickly make your
way to the nearest safe-haven friend’s
room and make yourself comfortable on
the shag rug.

3. Call as many friends as you can,
roam around rousing them from their
sleep and camp outside your door. Even-
tually someone is going to have to leave,
and when they do, break into a roar of
applause and snap a candid shot of the
shacker leaving. Sucks to suck.

5. Morning Makeout

You open your eyes to an unfamiliar
ceiling. You roll over to an even more
unfamiliar bed. As you try to determine
your location and escape route you hear a
gravelly “hey” come from the other side

cause I make polite, even friendly, con-
versation does not mean I’m interested.
Unless you’ve woken up with this per-
son before, assume they’re over it until
after they get some breakfast.

4. Walk of Shame

Everyone’s seen the occasional ﬁrst
year try to sneak up the stairs to their
own room or run across the quad in their
Halloween costume, but for off-campus

H shacking there is a whole new set of

rules. One of the worst, and most com-
mon, misdemeanors that can be com-
mitted during a Shack Attack is actually
what doesn’t happen. When you don’t
give your overnight guest a ride home,
you’re simply rude. This especially ap-
plies after 7am when the walk is ten times
more likely to encounter friends or pro-
fessors as you scurry through downtown
Lex. This rule also especially applies if
you live in a frat house not in/close to red
square. I’m sorry, but the mile walk back
from KA is not pleasant in the morning,
particularly as you dodge churchgoers in
your Dirty South outﬁt.

3. The Silent Treatment

The Speak Tradition is one of the
things that sets W&L apart. Another one
of those things is the Non-Speak Tradi-
tion effective immediately following

a shack. Maybe you have a legitimate
reason to avoid eye contact with some-
one who just days ago you were shov-
ing your tongue down their throat, but
probably not. Another common mis-
demeanor on the hook-up circuit is the
silent treatment. We’ve all experienced
a little awkwardness following a shack,
but complete silence isjust rude. I’m not
asking you to marry me (see no. 1), but
you could at least wave and acknowl-
edge that you know me.

2. There’s no “sleep” in sleepover

While some of our campus thrives on
the hook-up culture of the party scene,
there’s no law that says you have to get
down when shacking up. In fact, your
reputation, dignity and self-worth are
more likely to stay intact if you don’t.
We’ve all read the posters in the dorms,
and we all passed 7th grade health —
don’t do what you aren’t comfortable
doing. Just because you’re taking half
the bed doesn’t mean you have to return
any favors. So roll over and snore away,
your only obligations are to yourself.

1. Delusional Dater

Here we are, number one. The top
misconception of the shack culture: the
Delusional Dater. Everyone knows one,
is one or has been with one and some
might even argue a Delusional Dater
starts their sexual life out as a Morning
Make Out artist. Whichever way you
slice it, this person is all wrong. The
opposite of the silent treatment, the De-
lusional Dater immediately begins plan-
ning a wedding, mapping out the nurs-
ery, and searching for vacation homes
after getting the hook. They frequently
refer to their shacker as their “boy/girl-
friend” and tend to fabricate, expand on,
and just plain make up ridiculous facts,
stories and situations to go along with
their new “relationship”. Shacking is not
dating, and while the occasional shack
can turn into something beautiful, it is
important to remember the golden rule:
You are the rule, not the exception. Un-
less, of course, you arethe exception.

“You must study
to be frank with the
world: frankness is
the child of honesty
and courage. Say
just what you mean
to do on every oc-
casion, and take it
for granted that you
mean to do right.”

These are the
words of Robert E.
Lee, and they sum
up the importance of
honor at Washington
and Lee. For a con-
cept that surrounds
W&L students everywhere, there is nothing
more nebulous than the deﬁnition of honor.

This article will explore some ofthe deﬁn-
itive issues in the Honor System, from where
it applies, its broadness of scope, and some
grey-area situations. Ultimately, the student
body deﬁnes the concept of honor, so take
some time to think about what honor and the
honor system mean to you.

 

ByJoI'inPaulB-eiall
COLUIMIIST

Most everyone can agree that the Honor
System is present “on the hill.” Lying, cheat-
ing, and stealing are the Holy Trinity of honor
violations, demonstrated by verbose tour
guides through open doors, unattended lap-
tops, and the famous “take-home” tests. By
extension, honor has its place in dorms, Greek
houses, and into the community, if at least
through stealing and academic cheating. The
situation gets more difﬁcult with social cheat-
ing and lying, which are harder to pinpoint.

What about in the community? Consider a
situation where a police ofﬁcer asks an intoxi-
cated person if he or she is sober. Should this
person lie to the police oﬁicer, or moreover, is
this grounds to visit the Executive Commit-
tee? What if a person lies to a student govern-
ment body like the Student Faculty Hearing
Board or the Student Judicial Council about
something they did out in the community? Is
that conduct unbecoming or an Honor Viola-
tion? Depending on the degree or type of vio-
lation, should different sanctions be admin-
istered besides permanent removal from the
W&L community?

Some may wonder if certain questionably

dishonorable acts could be considered HVs or
be held subject to the single-sanction policy,
but the threat of punishment is not what hon-
or is about. Honor means doing the morally
conventional and right thing, regardless of
beneﬁts or consequences. Honorable people
do not need sanction as a deterrent from ac-
tion. The chance that someone is less likely
to report a cad at a party than a cheater in the
classroom should not make the difference in a
person’s actions. Is the threat ofsoiled reputa-
tion enough in social cases?

To close, one last Robert E. Lee quotation:
“The trite saying that honesty is the best poli-
cy has met with the just criticism that honesty
is not policy. The real honest man is honest
from conviction of what is right, not from
policy.” The true strength of our honor sys-
tem is not in policy and codiﬁcation, but in the
people who adhere to it. So, it is up to us all
to perpetuate it, especially by talking about it.

I challenge everyone who reads this to take
a short study break and think about the Honor
System for a few minutes, to ensure that our
community of trust will always remain.

Tips on all-nighters

All-nighters are
sometimes a fact of
college life. There
is no avoiding them.
There is that ten
page paper you for-
got about, that group
N project that somehow
turned into a you-
project, or just those
- painful-but-neces-
sary all-night cram-
 ming sessions.

Not that this is all
bad - sometimes it’s
easier getting all your

work for the week done in one night. Plus, the
adrenaline rush from having a three thousand
word paper due in ﬁve hours can be quite ex-
hilarating. Yay for dates with Leybum! lt’s the
day after that you have to worry about. Life,

class, and people don’t stop happening just
because you spent the last twelve hours glued
to a computer screen.

So, how do you avoid acting and looking
like a tired, washed out zombie the next day?
There is no real answer to this, but here are
some things that can help...

1. Don’t wear the same clothes that you
wore yesterday. The temptation is to go
straight from Leybum to class but trust me -—-
people will notice. (Actually, they probably
won’t notice but you will be so paranoid that
they will that you won’t be able to concentrate
at all).

2. ...on that note, trade the hoodie for the
Barbour. Dressing nicely can be a great mood-

booster - aka how you dress is how you act, or r

so the idea goes.

3. Buy a 5-hour Energy! Just when the ﬁrst
cleaning crew hits Leybum, around 4 AM,
you need to start getting energized up. (Just

, Sally Platt is quick list on how to survive ﬁnals week and staying up all night

don’t go overboard, energizer bunnies are not
attractive).

4. Resist the urge to speak in class unless
you have fully formulated your ideas. The
sleep deprived brain has a tendency to go on
long rambles and bunny trails - fun, but not
always the most useﬁil thing if you are trying
to look vaguely intelligent.

5. Listen to Christmas music! Even one lit-
tle “Holly Jolly Christmas” or “Jingle Bells”
before class can have the best effect. (And
have a candy cane, too. Why not?)

Finals week is almost upon us. All-night
dates with Leybum will be happening. Just
make sure you’re not that kid who comes
stumbling into class looking like a wreck
(teachers read this as: hung-over). So, change
out of your sweats, take a 5-hour Energy, and
survive ﬁnals week! Christmas is almost upon
us.

During this holiday season, students
at Washington and Lee should be fo-
cused on the most important “F.” No,
not friends or family, but ﬁnals! The
only way students can truly appreciate
the holidays is by getting all of their fall
semester classes off their backs. And
the only way your parents will actually
step up and get you the presents that you
really want is for them to see you over-
achieve on your report card. Basically,
you need to crush ﬁnals these next two
weeks to have any semblance of joy over
the next month. No pressure though,
because I have some advice that should
help you dominate ﬁnals the same way
LSU dominates everyone else who plays
football.
Use the Saturday Final Exam slot
This is probably the most impor-
tant strategic advice you can take for
the ﬁnals period. Assuming you have
three exams and a paper due during ﬁ-
nals week, you can make your week
much more manageable by simply tak-
ing a Saturday exam. This allows you to

There are many activities we engage

me at our 50th reunion when everyone is

1. Give up loud music—Do you

the music!

space your exams and papers over two
day spans rather than having to do two
exams on back to back days. I promise
that by Wednesday, you will be burnt out
by exams, and there is no way you can
crush two exams after you are already
burnt out.
. That being said, nobody likes study-
ing that much on Friday nights. You are
ready for the weekend, and you will be
easily distracted by anything and every-
thing. So, make sure you take your easi-
est exam on Saturday. You can crush it,
and you won’t need to worry about it lat-
er in the week. Plus, once you are done
with the Saturday afternoon exam, you
can successﬁilly...

Celebrate Saturday Night

This is an absolute must. Taking ﬁnal
exams is like taking a girl on a dinner
and movie date: you can’t be successful
if you don’t have anything to look for-
ward to. You won’t put as much effort
into a date if you know you won’t be get-
ting a happy ending, and you won’t put
as much into studying if you know that
once you are done, you will only have
to study more. So, reward yourself for
a hard day’s work by enjoying Saturday
night. I’m not saying that you should
get plastered because you want to have
enough energy to study on Sunday, but
you should still have a good enough time
to say things like “Woah, it’s already De-
cember 2011; time goes by fast.”

Take Your Hardest Final on Mon-
day Afternoon

Under no circumstances do you want
to put off taking your hardest ﬁnal. You
will be close to mentally checked out by
mid-week, and if you have another ﬁnal
hanging over your head, the health cen-
ter might put you on suicide watch. Plus,
all the best study groups and review

sessions meet on Sunday night in the
library. At this point, most students are
focused on studying and not complain-
ing about how hard their week has been.
Plus, you need to take the exam in the af-
ternoon because you will need the extra

strategy is to take coffee in the mom-
ing, a caffeinated beverage (like Moun-
tain Dew Amp!) in the early afternoon,
a 5-hour Energy right after dinner, and
then a beverage of your choice late at
night when the 5-hour starts wearing off.

Taking final exams is like taking a girl on a dinner

and movie date: you can ’t be successful if you don ’t

have anything to look forward to.

 

half day to study for your hardest class.
Furthermore, since you probably slept in
on Sunday, waking up early on Monday
will be that much harder.

Caffeine! Caffeine! Caffeine!

There is signiﬁcant worldwide news
that has gone under the radar in 2011.
Neither the Ring-tum Phi nor the Rock-
bridge Report has given adequate men-
tion to arguably the greatest threat to
grades at Washington and Lee. Accord-
ing to the FDA, there is a nationwide
shortage of Adderall. This means that
around mid to late December, profes-
sors will start complaining that students
at Washington and Lee don’t work as
hard as they used to because the average
test score went down considerably from
the last semester. Due to this panic, the
supply will dwindle even more because
sellers will worry about the possibility of
actually getting their next prescription,
and prices will most likely go through
the roof. And don’t think that Ritalin and
Vivance aren’t getting the same treat-
ment.

Therefore, you will need to take as
much caffeine these next two weeks as
humanely possible ifyou want to survive
the Adderall Armageddon. The basic

Yeah, it’s not exactly a 12-hour amphet-
amine cycle, but what are you going to
do? Not take drugs?

Stay the whole week

I know the prospect of ﬁnishing all
of your exams early and getting out of
school by Tuesday afternoon seems ap-
pealing, but by rushing exams, you won’t
get the grades you ultimately want, and
by leaving early, you miss the best part
of exam week: playing defense against
your most stressed friends. There is noth-
ing quite like drinking a beer and turning
up the television to ﬁill volume on your
off night while your roommate is busy
writing a paper. The passive aggressive
comments and the repeated, “Please, just
stop doing that!” will provide you with
ample entertainment for the night. There
is nothing as beautiful as Schadenfreude.

No F acebook or Twitter

Just deactivate the accounts now. If
any of your tests require online mate-
rial, you know that you will spend way
too much time looking at needless news
feeds instead of studying. Nothing in-
teresting socially happens during ﬁnals
week, and the only people using Face-
book during ﬁnals week are the good for
nothings who are addicted to it and have

avigating through ﬁnals week

nothing better to do. The only social as-
pect of your life that you should be wor-
ried about is staying single. You do not
need a relationship to be distracting you
from your studies at this point.

More importantly, you should not be
tweeting during ﬁnals week. Let’s face
it, you are only going to use it to write
things like “Two exams down, two to go
#mylifeishard #pleasepityme.” You are
only drawing needless attention to your-
self, and your blatant narcissism is only
going to distract you from your studies.
For that matter...

No Video Games

Let’s say that you partied a little too
hard on Saturday night, and as punish-
ment, your roommates locked away your
television and XBOX 360 for a couple
of days. You can either be angry and ag-
gressive at the move, or you can look
at it in a positive way. Maybe, you can
use the time you would spend watch-
ing “Breaking Bad” or playing “Modem
Warfare 3” to do some extra studying.
Just something to think about.

Look, the key to ﬁnals week is mini-
mizing distractions while keeping pro-
ductive incentives intact. If you can do
quality work while watching a marathon
on ABC Family, then by all means go
ahead, but don’t be that kid talking about
fantasy football on the morning of your
history exam, or you’ll be writing essays
about how bullshit it was that Adrian Pe-
terson and Fred Jackson both got injured
on the same weekend when they were
clearly the best running back duo in your
league. By the way, it is total bullshit.

Don’t be a scrub

you than throwing back a Diet Coke.

ally want to know.

aspartame—the sugar substitute in Diet

before I rebounded.

ever happen.

Scientists suggest that the phthalates in

Virginia beat us...I thought they said

time. On to the next one.

6. Give up tanning—You make
think golden skin looks better now, but
wrinkles and cuts where skin cancer has
been removed won’t look" better when
your 50. There’s Botox and faceliﬁs, but
they do not look the same as naturally
taut skin. Don’t forget that skin cancer
can kill you.

But, let me guess, this does not apply
to you because you are seasonally de-
pressed, vitamin-D deﬁcient, white as a
ghost, preparing your skin for your tropi-
cal winter break vacation. . .I don’t want
to hear the excuses. Pale is the new tan!

Now that I have made you aware of
all the self-destructive behaviors you en-
gage in on a daily basis, do not have a
panic attack. Maybe make some adjust-
ments, or maybe just enjoy being young,
hot and functional and forget about the
future. Ignorance can be bliss.

Breaking out of the W&L bubble

‘ With just
, over two and

left, my semes-
ter in Madrid
is drawing to
a close. Three
months could
not have ﬂown
by any faster. I
have to admit
that when 1 ar-
rived in Spain
at the beginning
of September,
I was nervous
about living alone in a foreign country
for such an extended period of time.
Nevertheless, as I fell into a routine of
going to classes at the Middlebury insti-
tute, going to Bikram yoga and hanging
out with my newly acquired (and quite
international) friend group, I found that
my stay here is quite limited. While the
past three months have been short, they

ByFranoescaWison
cutumusr

have undoubtedly been the largest period
of personal growth in my life.

In my ﬁrst article, I discussed the im-
portance of feeling uncomfortable. Dur-
ing my freshman and sophomore years
at Washington and Lee, I was rarely un-
comfortable and always well cared for.
For example, if I was ever feeling sick,
the health center was a few minutes
away. If I was working on a research
paper and I needed a speciﬁc source,
Leybum was bound to have it and in
all honesty, Inter-Library Loan requires
very little personal effort besides ﬁlling
out a fonn. And, let's not forget that in
Virginia there isn't a casual language
barrier to deal with.

Here in Spain, I've had to go to the
doctor's office and deal with pesky in-
surance companies, trek twenty-ﬁve
minutes out of my way to look for re-
search sources and had to converse in
Spanish almost the entire time almost
entirely on my own. Ironically, speak-
ing in Spanish provides me with much

less stress than ﬁling insurance claims
and travelling to the other end of Madrid
in search of a particular source. During
these moments of stress, I've broken
down, laughed in irony and gritted my
teeth, all the time trying to remind my-
self that the‘tough moments are the mo-
ments that undoubtedly build character
and personal strength.

It isn't until the end ofa particularly
long day, when I ﬁnd that I'm still stand-
ing, that I realize how much I've grown. I
did not know how to be alone six months
ago, when I packed my bags and depart-
ed sorority row. While I traveled west
to east for university, I've been lucky
to be surrounded by many people with
whom I identify and always had friends
to reach out to if I was ever in need. Dur-
ing my two-year tenure at Washington
and Lee, I never once felt entirely alone.
Throughout my semester abroad not
a day has gone by where I haven't felt
lonely in one sense or another, whether
it is because I feel physically isolated

in my homestay or emotionally isolated
by the language barrier. While this real-
ity may seem daunting, I believe it has
fundamentally changed my character for
the better. Feeling lonely has forced me
to get to know myself and to learn what

(makes me happy because I haven't had

best friends to run to when I've felt in
doubt. I've learned how to make time for
myself and honestly, to solve my own
problems. I have never felt more self-
sufﬁcient. In addition, I've learned how
to live in a big city. I'm comfortable with
the metro, 1 function without a car and
large crowds of people no longer stress
me out. Although this semester has been
a_ period of major life transitions, I ﬁnd
that as it draws to a close I am content,
tranquil and grown-up.

My main goal with these articles has
been to shed some light on my experi-
ence in Spain in the hope that my words
will inspire more Washington and Lee
students to explore past the Lexington
city limits. While W&L has a tremen-

dous amount to offer on campus, I be-
lieve that our school is no match for
what awaits each of us in Europe, Asia,
Latin America, Africa, Australia and the
Middle East. I realize it's easy to get into
the groove of W&L and the idea of leav-
ing our cozy campus is daunting, but I
bet that by the end of sophomore year,
most students could do with a break
from Windfall parties and may be a little
bit sick of alternating between Blue Sky,
Hillel and the occasional Bistro lunch.
Choosing to be uncomfortable for a little
while will only make you fully appre-
ciate what you have to come home to.
Although I have another semester left,
in London, I have to say that my tum-

Reviewing the White Book

Suggestions to the EC: make your work more accesible and transparent to students

By Todd Smith—Schoenwalder
co NT R I B u TO R

“Ifmen were angels, no government
would be necessary.”

Recognizing the truth of Madison’s
assertion, the Washington and Lee stu-
dent body has elected an Executive
Committee that serves as enforcers of
the Honor System. The White Book, our
equivalent of a constitution, essentially
guides the lZC’s procedures, thereby
establishing a relative “check” on its
power. Every several years, the EC ap-
points students to a White Book Review
Committee. Recently, I applied for a
position on this board. In my applica-
tion, I suggested some modiﬁcations to

Book by a two-thirds vote of the quo-
rum present in two consecutive votes,
provided that such votes are at least
one week apart.” Curiously, the White
Book describes the only direct amend-
ment process of itselfto be in the hands
ofthe EC. Notice that there is no equiv-
alent ofa public referendum.

Suppose that you conceive a brilliant
improvement to the White Book. You
create a petition supported by hundreds
of signatures. You initiate a school-wide
vote, and your idea garners the major-
ity of votes! Unfortunately, this changes
nothing. Even though the students,

our charter document, which were not
well received. I am certain, however,
that those chosen for the White Book
Review Committee will respectfully
carry out their duty in the manner our
EC envisions.

As a student who lives by our Honor
System, I believe it is my duty to write
this article in order to stimulate proac-
tive discussions concerning the White
Book as it presently exists. I deem it to
be deﬁcient in two ways. Therefore. I
offer the following suggested reforms.

The ﬁrst of these ideas relates to
the following passage from the White
Book: “The Executive Committee may
adopt such an amendment to the White

by the Division

recorded 12 individual incidents to date.

The ﬁrst sighting took place on Nov.
28, when ﬁrst-year Buddy Elphe report-
ed seeing a man dressed in a red wool
suit, velvet cap, and black buckle boots
running down the Colonnade.

“It was the ﬁrst day back from
Thanksgiving break, and I was sitting in
the middle in my writing seminar when
all of a sudden I see this random guy lit-

said Elphe. “At ﬁrst I thought he was

those truly upholding the Honor Sys-
tem, embrace the amendment, the White
Book states that only the EC can alter
our legal statutes. Essentially, we’ve
given total judicial, executive, and leg-
islative power to a few elected ofﬁcials.
Madison argues that such encompass-
ing power is the “very deﬁnition of tyr-
anny.” However, I cannot in good con-
science deem any member of the EC as
tyrannical. But, the ﬂaw still exists. Let
it be rectified by adding an amendment
to the White Book that provides:

If a student submits a petition of at
least ﬁve hundred signatures to the Ex-
ecutive Committee regarding an amend-
ment to the White Book, a vote will then

be held among the student body in a
timely fashion. If either two-thirds of
those voting or the majority of the stu-
dent body polls in favor of the amend-
ment, then this student body-led process
amends the White Book, thereby by-
passing the Executive Committee.

Undoubtedly, such an amendment
process would modestly reduce the
EC’s highly centralized power over the
Honor System, and grant due voting
rights to the student body.

The second idea involves a concept
regarding both accountability and trans-
parency. The EC‘s initial “closed trial” is
one shrouded in mystery. All involved
are bound by vows of secrecy, allow-
ing the EC’s actions to go unchecked.
Nowhere in a civilized courtroom does
this “black box” method exist. Even the
US. Supreme Court produces video of
its proceedings.

Transparency allows for citizens
to become more involved with legal
procedures, thus producing a more en-
gaged body ofcitizens as a whole. They
can access the dissenting and majority
opinion of the Court itself, as well as
documents that help to shape the ﬁnal
opinion, such as briefs ﬁled by amicus

' curiae. If the student body is to be le-

gitimately involved in the implementa-
tion oftheir own system, the present re-
strictive construction ofour White Book
must be altered.

Clearly, it is critical that this new,
participatory Honor System have a
foundation of pellucidity. Yet surface-
level implications arise from this argu-
ment. Does one publish the votes of

going to streak or something, but then
I remembered that it was 3 in the after-
noon, and who would do that in broad
daylight? He was also wearing way too
much to do that.”

According to Elphe, the mysterious
‘man was also carrying a giant burlap
sack over his shoulder.

“He had this enormous bag on his
back - I have no idea where he got
it from - but I’m pretty sure I saw the
sleeve of a blue W&L sweatshirt hang-
ing out, and some Vineyard Vines bags
and a couple of bow ties in there, too,”
Elphe said, noting that she reported the
suspicious activity to authorities imme-
diately that day. “It looked like he had
the entire school store stuffed inside that
sack. Call me crazy, but I know what I
saw.”

Elphewho rln fact, the thought that
this individual could have been Santa
Claus did not occur to him until offi-
cials at the Division of Student Affairs
suggested the possibility, after creating
a character sketch of the man based on
Elphe’s descriptions.

“This person did seem rather famil-

tothe editor

I am a silent reader ofthe Ring-Tum-
Phi, an advocate for honesty and fair-
ness, and subscriber to Christianity. But,
I cannot remain silent any longer about
the hypocrisy that has entrenched itself
in media, politics, and students minds.

I would like to use a recent article,
“Defending Gay Marriage” by Ali
Greenberg, to illustrate my point. Cer-
tainly, I am not advocating one way or
another on gay marriage, however, the
language Ms. Greenberg uses is indica-
tive of a growing social problem — the
use of demeaning, condescending, and
utterly useless language to attack the
opposition by liberal thinkers. To be
sure, both sides ofthe proverbial politi-

cal aisle use wildly unfair characteriza-
tions of one another, but this nuanced
attacked is different.

Ms. Greenberg writes: “At the end of
the day, [gay marriage] is a moral issue,
but not the kind that the religious zealots
would like you to believe.”

This is the type ofargument structure
that Liberals love to use. Rather than
make a cohesive argument, they resort
to attacking individual‘s backgrounds
or religious beliefs. The argument for
abortion, gay marriage, and many other
issues are played out this way.

Many Christians believe in Creation-
ism or Intelligent design. Liberals call
this idiotic or Bible thumping. Many

time we’ve had to deal with something
like this,” said Director of Student Af-
fairs Nicholas Carol. “As a matter of
fact, we’ve had several encounters with

volved him showing up on campus and

actually become quite a tradition. The
reason we do not normally draw atten-
tion to this is because we do not want
students to be distracted from their stud-
ies, especially in the weeks leading up to
ﬁnal exams.” .

While Carol welcomed the festive
visits from Santa, he expressed his con-
cern about the timing of the most recent
encounter: “I am a little surprised with
how early Mr. Claus showed up this
year... normally students report seeing
him during the ﬁrst week of Decem-
ber, but never in November. Hopefully
this development will not interfere with
scheduled campus activities.”

According to the Division of Stu-
dent Affairs, the number of sightings
increased steadily throughout the week,
becoming progressively more public

conservatives do not believe in gay mar-
riage. Don't tell a liberal or you’ll be
called a “bigot." Many conservatives
believe in cutting spending to certain
entitlement programs. Well, be careful
or you'll be called a fascist or worse,
a “racist." So we have an abundance
of conservative or Christian Americans
who remain silent for fear that voicing
our moral beliefs will lead to verbal at-
tacks.

A recent example shows the height of
this hypocrisy. Two weeks ago, Repub-
lican candidate for President Michele
Bachmann went on the .limmy Fallon
show. The walk on song chosen was en-
titled “Lyin‘ A**  with offensive

each closed trial? No, the votes are use-
less without the case itself. What if a
detailed account of the trial, with names
of those involved stricken out, is pub-
lished alongside the votes? No, the ac-
cused could be easily identiﬁable within
our small community merely from the
other details of the case.

Therefore, I propose the following:
allow the accused the option to open his
or her “closed” trial to the student body.
All current aspects of the closed trial
would remain the same, except students
could sit in for the entire trial. The EC
would still act as adjudicators; however,
now some light would be shed on their
otherwise clandestine practices. We
must realize that the option of a trans-
parent legal system is a fundamental
civil right among advanced societies
such as ours.

The notion that a governing docu-
ment precludes the accused from having
this right is perhaps the most inherently
unjust of all. By decreeing that ano-
nymity is in each student’s best interest,
the White Book patronizes the entire
student body and certainly the accused
student. Proponents of this method
claim that an aceused’s identity must
be kept anonymous, as the student’s
reputation would be tarnished merely
because of the accusation itself. I ar-
gue that if a member of our community
wants his or her EC trial accessible to
the student body, then a refusal of this
simple request is a mockery of any no-
tion of due process. The EC disagrees
with my core belief that the closed trial
should offer open doors to all, but refut-

   
 
 
  

with each new encounter.

“I was grabbing coffee from the
Co-op when this bearded guy suddenly
comes in whistling ‘Jingle Bells,’ and
orders a glass of wann milk and a platter
of sugar cookies. Like, who "even gets
that?” said junior Cindy-Lou Hoo. “And
then he walks out laughing, saying ‘Ho,
ho, ho, and to all a good night! ’ in this gi-
ant booming voice. I was so confused.”

Students also reported feelings of be-
ing observed by an unidentiﬁed man in
D-hall.

“l was just eating my breakfast one
moming, minding my own business,
when I felt a pair of eyes boring into my
back, like someone was watching me. I
turned around and there’s this grandpa
staring at me and scribbling furiously
into his notepad. He was mumbling
something about ‘naughty’ and ‘nice.’
Not gonna lie, it kind of creeped me
out,” said ﬁrst-year Kris Kingle.

The most prevalent number of sight-
ings happened on Wednesday night,

tweeted that it was a “perfect ent ong

on the song choice prior to the show on
Twitter. This situation is utterly reptil-
sive and offensive. A woman running

ment on TV. Yet. very few people have
reported on it. No apology was issued.
I lypocrisy abounds.

I can guarantee that if Nancy Pelosi

cumstance occurred, the media would
be up in arms about the bigotry and

servative.

ing the right of the accused to make this
so infringes on a civil liberty.

Finally, consider what the accused
student stands to gain from opening his
or her closed trial to the public. Hon-
or Advocates will be better prepared
knowing they are being scrutinized not
only by the EC but also by an intelli-
gent and discerning student presence.
The EC, now removed from secrecy,
will more carefully reach its ﬁnal ver-
dict when acting before its constituents,
the student body. Finally, the EC itself
can gain from this amendment simply
because its members can now publicly
demonstrate how engaged and compas-
sionate they are in the case before them.

The underlying premise of these two
ideas is both practical and philosophi-
cal. We must learn to challenge a sys-
tem unopposed, if only because history
shows that government will not chal-
lenge a structure to which it answers.
Therefore, is it not strange that we hold
our current Honor System to be perfect
and sacrosanct?

No system, even one based upon
“time-honored tradition,” can be ﬂaw-
less. I implore you to actively seek

these changes and produce conversa-
tion among your peers concerning the
validity of the current White Book. In
order to foster an open discussion of
these issues, I ask the EC to respond to
my concerns through a public forum.

On-site campus staff also noted vari-

the recent Santa sightings.

“All of the holiday decorations and

According to Carol, the encounters
should continue until the beginning of

“For some reason, the sightings’ al-

expect Santa to keep on appearing until
then. Who knows where he could show
up next?” he said.

Ce iii v the rhetoric on both sides
of the at. e can be toned down. But dis-
counting individuals using loaded terms
like bigot, zealot, or racist is wrong. The

act that I omit my name from this
emanates that same fear of criti-
cism from the left that I will be called a
bigot or a crazy Christian. Ms. Green-

New “noms” in LeXVegas

John Blackburn is second restaurant, Pure Eats, features burgers, doughnuts and locally-produced foods

By Stephanie Krasnov
STA F F W R IT E R

A new restaurant occupying the blue
roofed cottage of 107 North Main St.
is thriving by selling mouth-watering
burgers and decadent doughnuts. Pure
Eats opened during September of this
year, and owner John Blackburn plans to
make his second restaurant a hit.

As a small town that relies heavily
upon the business of college students,
restaurants in Lexington come and go
quickly. Blackburn, who also co-owns
the Red Hen in Lexington, seems to
know how to keep his restaurants thriv-
ing.
“I’m a big believer in the purity and
integrity of the food,” Blackburn said.
Although their menu may be small (12
items), the quality of the food is the
highest.

Many restaurants may offer larger
menus, but this is why Blackburn thinks
they may have failed in the past.

“You can’t do everything,” he said.
Instead, Pure Eats has radically simpli-
ﬁed a menu, “to things we can do excep-
tionally well.”

Their menu includes burgers, veggie
burgers, sweet potatoe and regular fries,
chips, deep fried potato salad, dough-
nuts, milkshakes, coffee, and soft drinks.

The name Pure Eats originates from
an old oil company named Pure Oil.
Pure Oil used to be one of the largest oil
companies in the country, and in the late
1920s, they began building service sta-
tions in what is known as the “English
Cottage Style.”

The Pure Eats building is one of the
best examples remaining in the U.S. of
the English Cottage style Pure Oil sta-
tion. It still has the original roof on it,
“that crazy, blue enamel tile.”

The iconic Pure Eats logo was ad-
opted from the old Pure Oil logo as well.

Pure Eats is open from 7:30 a.m. until
8 p.m., Monday through Saturday, and
11 a.m. until 8 p.m. on Sundays.

Doughnuts are baked each morning
by chef Katrina Ulrich. She comes in at
5:30 a.m. and bakes fresh cake dough-
nuts. Ulrich, who grew up in a doughnut
shop, invents all of the ﬂavors, ranging

from classic cinnamon sugar to Oreo
chocolate dipped, and even margarita.

“Her passion is doughnuts,” Black-
burn said.

The ﬁrst restaurant that Blackburn
opened was the Red Hen, also located in
Lexington. Washington and Lee junior
and Red Hen waitress Ali Greenberg re-
ferred to Pure Eats as the “younger sis-
ter” of the Red Hen. They both share the
same philosophy on local ingredients yet
cater to different crowds.

Blackburn says that one of the things
he loves most about Pure Eats is that it’s
open all the time and the following they
have generated. Its sort of “anybody and
everybody, and at Red Hen it’s a certain
clientele.”

The pricing of the menu and casual
atmosphere is what makes Pure Eats ap-
pealing to a much wider audience than
the Red Hen.

“I like having a place where anybody
feels comfortable coming in,” Blackburn
said.

Although Pure Eats has a seemingly

Students to perform this Tuesday and Wednesday, showcasing their own

By Paige Gance
ARTS&LlFE EDITOR

The Theatre and Dance Department
will present W&L Dancers Create...,
an entirely student choreographed, de-
signed, and performed production,‘at 7
p.m. in the Keller Theatre this Tuesday
and Wednesday.

The show will feature ll different
student pieces and a guest composition
from Zaq Lawal ‘I0, which will include
a number of duets and group works
staged by troops of eight to 13 dancers.
These selections will exhibit various el-
ements of dance, ranging from jazz to
rock & roll to Kathak, an Indian classi-
cal dance.

Jenefer Davies, Assistant Professor
of Dance, organized the program and
said every student contributed an aver-
age of 70 hours toward the show, taking

on tasks normally completed by faculty
and staff.

“The purpose of this production is
to highlight student work. It was cre-
ated to celebrate our student dancers and
the amazing talent they contribute to the
W&L campus. It’s also a very practical
outcome of a semester’s worth of creat-
ing, critiquing, rehearsing and refining
student dance works,” said Davies. “In
addition to creating and performing the
dances, students researched and edited
the music, are stage managing, working
lighting and sound as well as backstage
and marketing it.”

Junior Jennifer Ritter, a student cho-
reographer, said, “[This] really allows
us... to explore and experiment with
dances that we have been thinking about.

The purpose is to expose all of the cho-
reographers and dancers to working with
their peers and learning to adapt to each
other’s different styles. And plus, it’s
just fun for us to be able to perform and
show each other’s choreography for the
W&L community.”

Ritter developed two individual cre-
ative pieces, The Experiment and Wan-
derings, which delve into the lyrical
movement of time and space.

“Choreographing is always a scary
experience at ﬁrst for me, because I never
know how things are going to go... how-
ever, it is always so much fun getting to
know and work with the dancers and in
the end, it all works out and a dance has
been made,” said Ritter. “The best mem-
ories are made in rehearsals where we

equal following among the community
and college students, Blackburn said
they realized just how important stu-
dents were over Thanksgiving break.

“When the students went away
last week we realized how much a
part of business our students are,” he
said.

Washington and Lee senior Eliza-
beth Stames says that the reason she
chooses Pure Eats over other restaurants
is because “The food is fresh and of a
good quality, and the establishment is 10-
cally owned.”

Some think that the prices are a bit
steep, but as Stames noted, “If I wanted
to get a cheap burger and fries I would
go to Wendy’s or McDonalds.”

“We serve our meet fresh,” Black
burn said. “We pick it up from Charlie
Potter, the man who «raised the cattle,
three or four days a week.”

For anyone still caught up on the size
of their menu, Pure Eats plans to expand
this winter. Blackburn is looking forward
to introducing soups and stews as the

possibly a breakfast biscuit.
When walking into the restaurant
today a patron commented, “It’s a great
place! People seem to really like it!”
But don’t let him be the only judge,
go to Pure Eats today and try it for your-
self. Blackburn aims to please, “I want
everything to just blow your mind”

just get to become better friends while
sharing our passion for dance.”

According to Susan Wager, Assis-
tant Director of Lenfest Center, W&L
Dancers Create... began last year as an
opportunity for the W&L Repertory
Dance Company members to perform
and preview their choreographed works
in anticipation of the upcoming grand
production in March, which will feature
professional pieces in addition to student
compositions selected from this concert.

“Last year the performance was
packed by an overwhelmingmajority of
students and dedicated dance patrons,”
said Wager. “This year we anticipate an-
other full house.”

Davies stated that the ultimate goal of
the concert was to raise awareness about

the talent and creativity of the student
dancers throughout the school-wide and
local community. Davies said, “I hope
that audiences take away something that
changes their perception, makes them
think or challenges them in some way.
I hope they have a great time and feel
compelled to attend a dance concert
again. Eventually, it is my hope that they
realize the necessity of the arts in our
lives.”

Admission is free and opento the
public, although there is a suggested do-
nation of $10 to defray costs of partici-
pation in the American College‘ Dance
Festival.

7 - THE RING-TUM PHI-

ALEXANIDIZII MAl{AGOS

It’s been a while since I’ve last shared my thoughts, so let .
me catch you up on what I have been watchingon TV the last
few weekends: The Green Bay Packers. For those who have
managed to avoid Green Bay — which is easier to do with the

city than the team - I’ll get you caught up on what the defending I

champs are doing these days.

sports

t"l‘El’Illil I PECK

Out of curiosity, I looked up what the odds are that the
Green Bay Packers go undefeated the rest of the way in the
regular season. After perusing more greasy sports gambling
web sites than is probably healthy, I came across an article by
Wunderdog Sports (seems legit) that broke down the Pack’s
‘ chances in-depth.

The article examined the projected lines for each of their

5

I’ll start by reminding everyone that the Packers are really
stinkin’ good. I think their 12-0 record is the only evidence I
need. Second, I want to remind you how good the league’s best
player and my.MVP vote (if I had a real one), Aaron Rodg-
ers, has been. If Drew Brees’ passing performances were not
shattering the record books, Rodgers would be named MVP by
professional writers without second thought. Finally, let me tell
you that the Packers have had a relatively easy schedule to help
defend the Super Bowl crown that they won last year.

All we heard immediately after the Super Bowl last year

The Green Bay Packers are still undefeated
after 12 games, and some are predicting a
, erfect 16-0 record for the team. Others,

t ough, are still skeptical and ‘expect them
to trip up somewhere between here and the

Lombardi trophy.

Alex and Stephen add their two cents. 1

remaining games (-7 vs. OAK, -11 @KC, -7 vs. CH1, -7 vs.
DET), translated them into money lines, then translated those
ﬁgures into chances of winning percentages (86% vs. OAK,
90% vs. KC, 75% vs CHI, 75% vs. DET). Then doing some
higher math (multiplying those percentages together), it was
determined that the Packers have a 43% chance of going un-
defeated.

What does that say? Going undefeated is really hard to do.
Green Bay is 12-0, clearly the class ofthe league, and only has
four games left, two against teams they already beat and two

was: the Lombardi Trophy is coming home. Yeah, it did, but it

might be renting another year of space in the lobby of Lambeau Field if the Packers maintain
this high level of play. I know the playoffs are a different animal, just ask the 2007 New Eng-
land Patriots, but I don’t see anyone taking down the Packers this year.

Before the 201 1 season began, you might remember that I warned everyone to watch out
for the Packers this year. They won the Super Bowl last season with over a dozen players on
Injured Reserve. Coming into the season healthy, I knew Green Bay could do some serious
damage. And so far, they have delivered.

The Pack has had a favorable remaining schedule in 2011 to say the least. Looking back
on the season, their toughest test came on opening night against the Saints. That 42-34 win
started a full throttle and so far undefeated 2011 campaign. The Packers have only improved
over the course of this year, and aside from a small scare against the Chargers, have been on
cruise control.

In Week 14, they face the Oakland Raiders, who is surging thanks to the Bengals’ master-
ful Christmas re—gift of Carson Palmer. Still, Oakland is giving up over 374 yards of total
offense going into Week 13. I don’t see Aaron Rodgers and the rest of the offense tripping up
at home against that defense.

After the Oakland game, Green Bay visits currently 4-7 Kansas City, then will host Chi-
cago on Christmas Day and Detroit the next week to close out the regular season. I could
pull the Chicago—Meatball—Fan Card (they’re not hard to get) and predict that the Bears will
steamroll the Packers in their own building, providing the city with the best Christmas pres-
ent ever. Or would the Bulls beating the Lakers in LA on that same day be better? Flip a coin.
In any case, I couldn’t bring myselfto predict such foolishness even if Jay Cutler did not have
a broken thumb.

That leaves the Lions to defend the gates against a total Green Bay takeover for NFL su-
premacy.  Now in years past, I would rather have the best NCAA team

R‘ playing this game instead of the Lions. However, this
year they’re a really good team that is in the hunt for
‘ an NFC Wild Card berth. Still, even if the Pack-
. ers rest their starters—-something we usually hear
. from the Colts and Patriots year after year--the
Lions might not be able to stop the Packers.
Green Bay would be smart to rest Aaron
Rodgers and several other starters
toward the end of the season, but this
team is so sharp, quick, talented and
healthy, that they will play like they
have nothing to lose.

     
 

  

against teams that far inferior. And yet the odds still aren’t in
their favor. And rightly so, because I don’t believe they will ﬁnish 16-0.

Looking at their remaining games, the Packers seem like a lock to be 14-0 by week 16.
They host Oakland next weekend, then travel to Kansas City the week after. Both games
should get ugly quick.

But the week after that, the Chicago Bears travel to Lambeau Field on Christmas Day.
With llay Cutler at quarterback, I actually think Chicago can take this one. They have a
bruising defense, a stud running back in Matt Forte and a highly accurate, strong-armed
quarterback. They match up well, especially ifthere are unfavorable conditions and they
are forced to run the ball. And Chicago will really need this game to keep their wild card
hopes alive. The Pack could easily lose this game, especially if they decide to rest guys in
the second half. But I don’t see them resting guys in this game, and they certainly won’t
lose if Caleb Hanie is at quarterback for Chicago.

So that means that Green Bay will be 15-O headed into their match up with Detroit in the
last week ofthe season. I was at Ford Field for the Thanksgiving Game. I wouldn’t even call
it a game. It was a complete debacle. The Lions couldn’t do a single thing right. They out
gained the Packers by a significant margin in the ﬁrst half, but a terrible interception deep in
Detroit’s own end by Matthew Stafford gift wrapped a touchdown for the Packers. Stafford

“(and his broken ﬁnger) threw two more picks. The Lions didn’t take any shots downﬁeld.

Their two top defensive backs, Louis Delmas and Chris Houston, both got hurt, depleting
the secondary to the point where Rashied Davis, a wide receiver, had to play safety against
Aaron Rodgers. They took dumb, costly penalties. And to cap it all off, Ndamukong Suh
decided that it was a good idea to stomp on an opponent on national television. I’m not say-
ing Detroit lost that game as opposed to Green Bay winning it, but they sure made it a lot
easier for the Pack. 1 still think the Lions match up very well with the Packers. They have a
lethal passing game, the best receiver in football (MEGATRON), and a defensive line that
is among the league’s best and will be hungry to exact revenge.

In short, this game means a lot to the Lions. They might need to win it to make the play-
offs and they really want to show the Packers that Thanksgiving was a fluke. I don’t know if
I would let Aaron Rodgers play the second half ofa meaningless game for the Packers and
risk letting Suh try and decapitate him. I see the Lions winning this game.

The thing that might make the Packers go undefeated, is if Rodgers convinces Coach
Mike McCarthy not to rest him and instead let him go after some records. Aaron has a
shot to break Marino’s single season passing yardage total of 5,084 (Rodgers is on pace
for 5,054), Brees’ completion percentage record of 70.6 percent (Rodgers stands at 71.8),
Brady’s' touchdown record of 50 (Rodgers is on pace for 48), and Peyton Manning’s passer
rating record of 130.7 ( Rodgers stands at 127.7).

There is no right answer when it comes to playing or resting players with a perfect sea-
son on the line. The Patriots played their starters in week l7...yet lost in the Super Bowl.
A few years before, the Colts rested their stars. . .and also lost in the Super Bowl.

Whatever Coach McCarthy decides to do, rest some guys or play them all and go for the
perfect season, I think the Lions beat the Packers in the last week. '

But don’t fret Packers fans, you should be happy with a 15-1 regular season record and
another Super Bowl Championship, because nobody is beating you in the playoffs.

Occupy W&L: Fighting debt

Members of the so-called“0ccupy” generation ﬁnds creative ways to combat lingering student loan debt

By Mickey Gorman
STA F F WRITE R

Far from Zuccotti Park, in the back
of Washington and Lee’s performing arts
center, Tony Lawrence is ﬁghting back
against the one percent in his own way.

The scene shop in W&L’s Lenfest
Center for the Arts is in, shambles. The
destruction is the result of countless
hours of carefully disassembling the
scenery from recent plays. Lawrence,
the theater’s technical director, is re-
sponsible for building and taking down’
the set from each play. For the sake of
cost efficiency he must deconstruct the
scenery down to the last two-by-four so
the materials canbe reused.

. But after everyone else has left the
shop, Lawrence pushes all unﬁnished
projects and debris to the side and begins
work on his second job.

In an effort to pay off his student
loans, the theater’s technical director
uses his.skill as a carpenter to craft fra-
ternity paddles with the W&L trident to
sell to students in Greek organizations.

The 29-year-old Lawrence ﬁnds him-
self in what some people are now calling
the Occupy generation. Like many of his
peers, Lawrence is trying to make ends
meet while dealing with the weight of
student loans on his shoulders — $70,000
in loans, that is.

Despite reports in June from Colleg-
eGrad.com that hiring for entry leveljobs
increased 22 percent from last year, the
Occupy Movement spread like wildﬁre
to college campuses. Students express
concern about rising tuition costs, stu-
dent loan debt, and weak job prospects.

Students at schools like Harvard Univer-
sity and University of California, Berke-
ley, have tied these problems directly to
the Occupy Wall Street movement.

However, more relief seems to be on
the horizon. Interest rates are dropping
to eye-opening lows. Students may see
rates as low as 3.4 percent, Liz Weston
reported on MSN Money.

“I am going to reﬁnance my loans be-
cause interest rates are crazy [low] these
days,” Lawrence said.

This has been part of Lawrence’s pro-
active approach to overcoming the “one
percent”: trying to save a buck and make
a buck wherever possible. As far as the
rest of the occupiers, Lawrence tries to
-be sympathetic.

“I understand their plight,” he said,

“but you can’t expect to get a job if you
went to college for something useless...
like underwater basket weaving.”

In its newest survey CollegeGrad.
com, which bills itself “The #1 Entry
Level Job Site,”, reported that the col-
lege majors drawing the most entry level
job offers were business administration,
engineering, and marketing. Lawrence
majored in theater and went to graduate
school to receive a degree in theater with
an emphasis on technical direction.

With such a speciﬁc skill set acquired
through his unique education path, Law-
rence says that he has never worried
about job security. '

“People are always going to want
stuff,” Lawrence said. _

His newest example of “stuff” to

make and ‘sell are customized, hand
crafted fraternity paddles. He has not
determined a price for each paddle yet,
but is convinced he can beat the “inﬂat-
ed” prices of the W&L bookstore. The
bookstore, a popular outlet for fraternity
paddles, sells paddles for $15 in the win-
ter term.

Lawrence plans to go door to door
at fraternity houses giving his best sales
pitch. Every paddle is one step closer to
having his loans repaid.

“It is nothing to retire on, but any-
thing to help lighten the load of all that
debt,” Lawrence said.

ITS responds to student needs

New smart phone access maybe added after summer improvements to wireless networks and the stable

By Neil Haggerty
STAFF WRITER

Information Technology Services is
using the results of a May 2011 survey
to improve technology at Washington
and Lee.

According to the 444 survey respons-
es to the ITS survey, the main issues that
students at W&L felt needed to be ad-
dressed were “wireless network capac-
ity, wireless network coverage, and reli-
able and available University network.”

In response to these complaints ITS
informed students that they added wire-
less coverage to the archaeology labora-
tory, the Alpha Delta Pi sorority house

vice was also enhanced in the Intema-

During Thanksgiving break, ITS
made more improvements. The “entire
wireless system” received an upgrade,
according to a recent e-mail sent to all
students. That upgrade, ITS reported, has
helped ease “continuity in service when
students are moving between buildings.”

report. This includes the automatic con-
nection of network computers to printer,
new software, and training at the Smart
Zone for students who wish to learn how
to access local storage.

“The stable has been a huge blessing.
I no longer have to run around campus
to a desktop computer to access docu-
merits,” senior Ben Ersing said.

Another improvement that ITS made
in the classroom is the implementation
of Tegrity, a service that allows protes-
sors to record their classes.

 

According to the ITS response to
students, “The tool is now available in
about 25 percent of undergraduate class-
rooms, but many faculty members have
not embraced the tool.”

Some students, like Ersing, wish that
program was utilized more.

“I would love to be able to listen to
recordings of classes,” Ersing said, cit-
ing the difﬁculty of taking notes in cer-
tain classes that move at a very fast pace.
He said has not seen Tegrity used in any
ofhis classes in the Williams School.

Future improvements are also com-

ing. According to ITS, students may
soon be able to access school informa-
tion with smart phones.

‘ According to the e-mail, “ITS is test-
ing tools that would provide improved
access from smartphones to grades,
course listings and other University
data.”

Analyzing gender relations

After spending a semester abroad Francesca Wilson sheds light on gender relations ’ issues on W&L ’s campus

' In mid-
, December I
I returned to my
hometown of
San Francisco
after a fantas-
tic semester
in Madrid. I
had originally
intended to
spend the win-
ter studying in
London. How-
ever, after just
a few weeks at
home and suf-
ﬁcient time to catch up with my Wash-
ington and Lee friends, I realized that I
couldn’t bear another semester sans Lex.
Some urgent phone calls were made dur-
ing the first week in January but luckily
I arrived in Virginia just in time to start
the semester, which as you all know, co-
incides with sorority and fraternity rush.
I have to say that I grossly underes-
timated how overwhelmed I would feel

by my sorority’s recruitment efforts. The
exuberance of the singing, dancing and
cheering that deﬁnes rush week could
not have clashed more awkwardly with
the tranquility of my extra-curricular-
free study abroad experience. Needless
to say,Il spent the last week dazed and
confused in some form of reverse culture
shock that has only just begun to wear
off.

Throughout my week of re-integra-
tion I began to notice the stark gender
divide that exists within our community.
I think that before my sojourn on the Eu-
ropean continent I had become de-sensi-
tized to the issues of gender relations on
W&L’s campus. I wasn’t disturbed by the
fact that my only interactions with males
occurred in the classroom or on Wind-
fall. Of course I realized that our school
exhibits peculiar dealings between males
and females, but I had become so inte-
grated into the W&L social network that
I wasn’t bothered by such apparent mu-
tual objectiﬁcation of the sexes.

Nevertheless, after returning to

school, I am thoroughly perturbed by
the nature of gender relations at W&L.
I realize that my previous statement may
appear a bit dramatic and is likely large-
ly inﬂuenced by re-entering our school

By the end of the week the entire student
body is grouchy, fatigued, behind on
homework and desperate to drink. Satur-
day night eventually rolls around and the
males and females of Washington and

tainly not conducive to a gender healthy

invited to sumptuous dinners, receive
their bids (usually mid-week) and are re-
warded with copious amounts of alcohol.

Needless to say vomit, Health Center
trips, the occasional ER bound colle-
giate, Plan B popping and moral hang-
overs deﬁne Tear Night and certainly

account for an eventful start to the se-

the student body at long last crawls out
of bed, sidles into the library and delib-
erately avoids eye contact thus perpetu-
ating a negative environment of gender
relations on our campus.

My goal with this column is to ex-
plore fraternity and sorority centric
atmosphere of W&L and the ways in
which it specifically perpetuates issues
of gender relations within the univer-
sity. I am by no means pretending that
I have not at many points enabled this
particular gender divide. However, af-
ter leaving for a semester I believe I am
able to somewhat objectively critique the
gender dynamic on our campus. Galva-
nized and somewhat shocked by what
I observed last night, I hope to bring a
fresh and ﬁghting perspective to the con-
tinuous problem of mutual objectiﬁca-
tion between the sexes.

From free beer to slavery: four stages of brotherhood

Opinions Editor Campbell Burr describes how the Greek system controls the attitudes and actions

. . W At a school
I with the highest
percentage of
students who go
Greek, it is no
surprise that rush
and pledgeship
affect the mind-
sets and attitudes
of the students,
especially the
boys. After a lot
of observation

  
   

3‘, Campbell gun. and analysis,
OPINIONS Eniron 1 have broken
freshman year

into four phases based on the way boys
behave. This piece is not only meant to
inform you of the ways in which college
boys change overtime, but also to let you
know how you should expect to interact
with the boys in each stage.

So without further ado, I present
“The Four Stages of the Freshman Boy.”

Stage 1: Wow, Hot Girls and Free Beer

Stage 1 consists of the first two weeks
of school, when freshman boys are invit-
ed to all parties, surrounded by cute girls,

and given as much free alcohol as they
want. They have just been dropped off at
school and had their rooms decorated by
their mommies, who sent them with ex-
tra blankets, in case they get cold, and a
nightlight, in case they need to go to the
bathroom in the middle of the night. For
some, this may be their first time away
from their moms, and for others, their
ﬁrst experience with alcohol, and boy
do they think drinking is cool. Soon the
picture of John holding his baby cousin
will be replaced by a poster of two girls
making out (yes, they do sell this in the
school store).

If you walk through D-hall, you may
overhear some boys spitting the Alco-
holEdu terms they’ve been aching to use
all summer. “Dang it dude, I engaged in
some high-risk drinking last night and
casually browned out. Calculated that I
had 6 ounces of tequila in an hour. If that
isn’t binge drinking than I don’t know
what is.” These boys will make trip after
trip to reﬁll their cups with blue Pow-
erade in D-hall, just to show their class-
mates that they go hard.

This is also the period when the
health center has more overnight visitors

Every freshman boy gets a little bit
cocky as this stage progresses, but I
guess anyone would if a group of up-
perclassmen were worshipping him and

As much as we like to laugh at
these boys, we can’t. Whether you went
through this stage in 8th grade, llth
grade, or the ﬁrst week of college, you
went through this stage. Independence is
cool and so is free alcohol—some just
enjoy it later than others.

Stage 2: “Time isn’t wasted when
you’re getting wasted”

Stage 2 consists of the rest of ﬁrst se-
mester, when boys are trying to win the
respect of upperclassmen boys. They’lI
talk to them about sports, and the num-
ber of girls they’ve hooked up with at
school. All I can say is remember the
Rule of Three.

In this stage, boys are invited on rush
trips. These may consist of getting bel-
ligerently drunk, getting on a bus, going
to an Italian restaurant, passing out in
a restaurant booth, getting back on the
bus, throwing up, and passing Out again.
Strippers may also appear at events,
making some boys feel more guilt than
excitement over what they are witness-
ing. Fraternity informal rush consists of
anything that would be strictly forbidden

attending to his every need. The boys en-
joy “playing pong” after class on Fridays
and going back to fraternity houses to
hang out “late night.” They are also in-
vited to fraternity formals, always bring-
ing hot dates to impress the brothers.

Tear Night is their ﬁnal night of free-
dom and last chance to do outrageous
stuff to impress Older brothers and get
out of some pledgeship duties. If a fresh-
man boy says something along the lines
of, “I like kinda saw her bra,” he may
be granted an ‘extra hour of freedom that
week.

Stage 3: Eight Weeks of Slavery

The morning after Tear Night begins
the longest eight weeks of a freshman
boy’s year. They must attend to their re-
sponsibilities in school, as well as their
big brothers’ every need.

Pledgeship is also a weird period for
freshman girls. D-hall clears out, the ﬁrst
and second floors of Graham-Lees feel
vacant, and whenever you see a male
classmate, he looks tired and a little bit
miserable. You know it’s bad when your
male classmates have been wearing the

same shirt for a week and look like they
have lost twenty pounds because they
“can’t ﬁnd time to eat.” Wish I had that
scheduling problem. Besides offering re-
assuring smiles and occasional laundry
service, there is little girls can do.

Even though pledgeship seems mis-
erable, it accomplishes what it is meant
to accomplish. Pledge brothers become
absurdly close, closer than they could
become singing songs and baking cook-
ies together. By the end of pledgeship,
they are so in love with each other that
some boys contemplate why they needed
girls around in the ﬁrst place.

Stage 4: The Ego Boost

The same poor souls who wore dirty
clothes for eight weeks, failed tests, and
were deprived of sleep and food have
made a comeback. If you thought your
male classmates were cocky before
pledgeship, wait until you see them af-
ter. They are enjoying the hugest ego
boost of their lives, and have become a
different breed than the shy little fresh-
men their mommies dropped off at the
beginning of the year.

Topics of conversation with this new
breed: how awesome they are; how they
cannot wait to get their hands on the in-
coming group of “biddies” in the fall;
how nothing could compare to what
they have been through. They have been
through a lot and deserve our respect,
but beware that they may be a bit big-
headed.

Freshman year is ﬁ.1ll of changes for
boys. SO ifyou see a ﬁrst year who is un-
shaven and appears a bit stressed, don’t
feel too son'y for him. In eight weeks,
he’ll be going 70 mph down Washington
Street, blasting Widespread Panic and
thinking he’s the man.

Rooney and Zuroski describe Tear Night, an annual holiday at W&L

   

By “Bella Zumslii and
Bridget Rooney
C D L U M N15 TS

Congratulations — if
you’re reading this, you
survived Tear Night 2012!
(Hopefully you didn’t end
up in the health center/
hospital, but if you did —
there’s always next year!)
The following is a (hypo-
thetical) walkthrough of a
typical tear night:

If you’re a girl, you
start out with a nice car-
bo-loaded dinner at the
sorority house to prepare
yourself for the night (the
chefs know what’s up).
Next, you head to an off-
campus house for some
nice pledge class... bond-
ing. After a few hours of
dancing to “Rack City”
over and over (and over),
you ﬁnd yourself being
herded by your sober sis-
ters into the sorority ve-
hicles (typically SUV’s
covered in Greek letters
and exclamation points
— saooooo cute and spir-
ited!) to a fraternity house
to officially begin Tear
Night festivities. There,
you might ﬁnd yourself
in a number of situa-
tions, including bonding
with your new sisters on
the dance floor (oh-em-

gee! I I I) or “bonding” with
new fraternity pledges on
the dance floor. From
there, anything goes.
From around 10-12,
activities may include
romping around from
fratemity house to fra-
ternity house until those
Greek letter-clad SUV’s
come back to herd you
to the midnight breakfast
(There’s bacon! Presi-
dent Ruscio will be there!
You’ll love it I swear).
Naturally, you hear the
word “bacon” and run to
the car. At the midnight
breakfast, you will ﬁnd
yourself entranced by the
buffet of eggs, bacon, bis-
cuits, etc. However, you
may be among the few
who approach President
Ruscio angrily complain-
ing about the lack of pan-
cakes (common miscon-

ception about the name of
the event — it’s Midnight
Breakfast, not Pancake
Breakfast, people).

After the breakfast,
you have it dead set in
your mind that you are
making it to Windfall this
year. But when you get
there, the band is already
on its last song (but hey,
you made it!). So you
round up your freshmen
and bring them back to
the house to introduce
them to thejnirvana of
Frank Parsons Way — the
snack table. You might
walk around the halls
singing “Rack City” to
yourself for a while more
(you just can’t escape
that song), then hash out
the night and retreat into
snuggle mode, curling up
on afuton to fall into a
sweet Tear Night slumber.

The next morning, you
wake up and run around
the house (still in your
Tear Night ensemble),
rounding everyone up and
hashing out the night in or-
der to ﬁnd out who scored
the best DF M . Hypotheti-
cally, you get a freshman
to swipe you into D-Hall
for brunch (it’s no lon-
ger a rush violation!) and
watch the poor freshman
boys march off to the ﬁrst
day of a fabulous 8 weeks.

Although it’s sad that
the night that deserves to
be recognized as a nation-
al holiday is over, we’ll
always have the memories
(at least some of us will).
Only 365 days until the
next Tear Night!

  Outing Club Welcomes students back

Students snow-tube, hike, zipline and ice skate to celebrate the beginning of a new term and to escape the stress of rush

By Travis Wakeman
STA F F w RITE R

Non-Greek students and those need-
ing to escape the stress of rush week
could zip-line, hike under a full moon,
and go snow tubing and ice-skating as
part of the Outing Club’s “Welcome
Back Week.”

Starting with a full-moon hike on
Tuesday, a rollout rappel on Friday and
snow tubing and ice skating over the
weekend, the Outing Club offered ample
opportunities to release the stress that
many Greek students feel this time of
year. To independent students, the activi-
ties offered a chance to get off campus
while their Greek friends were busy.

James McCullum said after the
Wednesday hike, “When I left for this at
8:30 tonight my entire dorm was empty,
no one was there, there were no students
because I assume they were all pledg-
ing and its a little disheartening to be the
only one there, so getting out and being
with other students and friends is amaz-
ing.” '

While the main attendees were inde-

pendent upperclassmen and freshmen,
James Dick, the Outing Club Director,
said, “I really would like to tap into the
juniors and seniors who have had as
much Natty-light as they can handle in
the same basement, with the same DJ,
with the same friends, the same collared
shirts, how much can you do that before
your bored out of your mind?”

A number of “Greek students who
have tired with the same old-same old”
were in attendance at events through the
week, taking advantage of the time to
unplug and get away from it all.

At Wintergreen Resort, students
zipped down the equivalent of a l0-story
building at speeds of up to 30 miles per
hour, covering the distance of 3 football
ﬁelds in a matter of seconds.

‘The Outing Club’s “Winter Welcome
Week” activities have been a regular of-
fering for the past nine years with some
years featuring more caving or winter
sports depending on weather and student
preferences.

One of the toughest parts of making
Outing Club activities successful is get-
ting the word out. Students who partici-
pate often in events fonn a solid nucleus
of “networkers” who get other students
involved by word of mouth.

This year, the weekend snow tubing
trip was particularly popular and a great
bargain with an Outing Club fee of 10
dollars for tickets usually worth 30 dol-
lars. Even though the snow has been
sparse, the slopes at Wintergreen were
covered with a thick layer of man-made
snow.

For those who prefer to climb, the
rollout rappel allowed students to scale a
40-foot tree before dropping from a plat-
form and swinging like a pendulum. An
extensive belaying system ensured com-
plete safety for the climbers and those
waiting their turn below.

For a less physically demanding ex-
perience, aspiring astronomers and hik-
ing enthusiasts enjoyed an easy ‘hike
to the summit of Cole Mountain for

Stargazing. A clear night sky offered a
beautiful view of the moon and with a
telescope, students could view Jupiter
and three of its moons. Just fewer than
20 students braved the crisp night air and
were rewarded with hot chocolate and
apple cider.

Future events to look forward
to include the Everglades Kayak
trip over February Break (only
a few seats still available) ’
and possible ski/snowboard-
ing day trips to local resorts.
Disc-Golf and Geocaching
are available daily and can be
inquired about at outing@wlu.
edu. Trips are formed largely
based on student interest.

The Outing Club challenges stu-
dents to do something completely dif-
ferent and unique on at least one of the
nights normally devoted to partying.

“Its the same Pole house, its the same
beer, its the same- mostly- the same
people,” said Dick. “Come do one new

thing: rappel off of Chambers Ridge,
learn how to ﬂy-ﬁsh with me, do an
o1'ienteer- ing course, do a geo-
cache, come
caving.”

Convention speakers announced, Carvilleﬁrst non-party member to speak at a Washington and Lee Mock Convention

By Neil Haggerty
C o P Y E D IT 0 R

With only two weeks until the Wash-
ington and Lee Mock Convention, nine
more inﬂuential political ﬁgures, along
with Keynote Speaker Haley Barbour,
have been conﬁrmed for the convention.

Communications Co-Chair senior
Kali McFarland said the convention or-
ganizers wanted speakers to make the
convention as realistic as possible.

“We strive to make Mock Con as
close to an actual nominating convention
as possible. So, just like the real party
organizers use the convention as a plat-

‘ fonn for prominent or rising members of

the party to speak. . .we bring speakers to
our convention to do the same,” McFar-
land said. '

On Feb. 9, New York Times best-sell-
ing author and Republican political com-
mentator Ann Coulter and Democratic
political consultant James Carville will
kick off convention week by going head-
to-head in a debate. Coulter has suggest-
ed on her website that “Romney is the
most electable candidate” and Carville
has had long running success in manag-

at

 C()l,!fc]~  HlI(‘/{(11786

ing democratic political campaigns. Car-
ville is also the first out-of-patty speaker
in Mock Convention’s history.

According to senior Sorelle Peat,
Mock Convention Speakers Chair,
i“When selecting [Coulter and Carville]
‘we had a debate in mind. Knowing this
high energy Republican-Democrat pair-
ing would inevitably be both entertain-
ing and educational, we thought it would
be a great way to start off Convention
weekend.” *

This debate will be moderated by
Mike Allen ’86 and Kelly Evans ‘O7.

According to mockconvenfirm.com,
Allen “is the chief White House cor-
respondent for POLITICO” and Evans
is a Wall Street J0llI'I7(l/ Columnist and
“recently moderated the fiery Fox News/
WSJ Republican debate in South Caro-
lina.”

Following this debate will be an
opening speech by Mick Huckabee, the
former governor of Arkansas and Re-
publican pesidential primary candidate.
According to nzikeliuc/icabee.com, he is

the host ofa “number one rated weekend
hit” on the Fox News Channel.

“Huckabee seemed like an ideal
candidate for an opening speech for the
2012 Mock Convention because of both
his experience on the campaign trail and
as governor as well as his insights into
the Republican Party and the upcoming
election,” said Peat.

Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell

will also be speaking at the convention.
“McDonnell has gained national atten-
tion in recemt months as an inﬂuential
member of the Republican Party,” ac-
cording to moc'kconvention.com.

Republican House Majority Leader
and representative of Virginia’s seventh
Congressional District Eric Cantor has
been conﬁrmed to speak on the day of
the convention.

"His role in the House of Representa-
tives and his leadership in the Republi-
can Pany give him a different perspec-
tive than some of our other speakers.
We’re excited to see what his Congress-
oriented outlook will bring to the table,”

Peat said.

Another Virginia congressman, repre-
senting the sixth Congressional District,
Republican Bob Goodlatte, will also be
speaking at the convention. Goodlatte is
in his tenth term representing a district
with "more colleges and universities
than most other congressional districts in
the country,” including W&L, according
to good/afte.11oz1se. gov. »

Goodlatte is a W&L Law School
graduate and “has been incredibly sup-
portive of Mock Convention and W&L
in the past,” Peat said. ,

Republican Shelley Capito, also con-
firmed to speak at the convention, rep-
resents West Virginia’s second congres-
sional district. “She is currently the only
woman in West Virginia’s congressional
delegation,” according to capiro./vozise.

"Capito serves on our advisory board-

and has been a great supporter of W&L

she has many proud West Virginia con-

The future of health care policy

Columnist Yates Wilburn critiques Obamacare and takes a crack at sh

On March
26th of this year,
the Supreme
Court will hear
arguments
from lawyers
of the Obama
administration
and those of 26
states regarding
the constitution-
ality of the Pa-
tient Protection
and Affordable
Care Act, aka
Obamacare (for
convenience I’ll
call them the Dems and GOP, respec-
tively). Speciﬁcally, the case revolves
around the “individual mandate,” requir-
ing all Americans to purchase health in-
surance or face a ﬁne amounting to 2.5%
of a violator’s income. If this provision
is struck down, all the other provisions
of this law, Obama’s nation-saving/so-
cialist propagating achievement (pick
your poison) will be crippled at best and
destroyed at worst.

So, it’s a pretty big deal.

For kicks, let’s assume that the GOP
is successful, the Supreme Court rules
the individual mandate as unconstitu-
tional, and that all of Obamacare is, in
name and practice, repealed. Well, that
means we return to the old ways of doing
things. This means that while small 50-
employee businesses won’t go bankrupt
providing their workers with health in-
surance, the negatives of the old system

‘ will also return. That includes spending

caps, pre-existing conditions, etc. No
one wants that, so the GOP will have to
come up with an" alternative, a reform
bill so bold, revolutionary, and awesome
that it solves our healthcare problems
and doesn’t bankrupt the country at the
same time.

What is that going to look like? Con-
sidering the GOP’s tactic of using the
10th amendment to torpedo Obamacare
from the start, the GOP will more than
likely do little more than push federal
Medicare money to the states, include
something about people being able to
buy insurance across state lines, and call
it a day.

Just doing this and nothing else is
a bad idea. I can’t rely on the govern-
ment of my beautiful South Carolina to
do much of anything right, and I’m sure
everyone reading this would say some-

thing similar about his or her state. What
makes the GOP think the state govem-
ments will run things any better? The
South Carolina DMV gave me my per-
manent license 6 months early (leam-
ing drivers get it early if they have a
clean record) despite the fact that I had
2 speeding tickets and a ticket for roll-
ing through a stop sign! In fact, when I
checked later, those tickets weren’t even
on my record anymore (made me happy,
then horriﬁed). How is an entity like that
supposed to come up with healthcare
laws and reforms to beneﬁt its citizens
any more effectively than the federal
government?

I’m not saying we should stick with
Obamacare (oh please, God, in the name
of- small business nol), nor am I saying
that we should rely on a GOP Congress
to come up with an equally complicat-

doesn’t happen to be based in SC.

3. Disallow insurance companies
from using “pre-existing conditions” as
a shield. Not only is this a problem for
people changing insurance companies
for whatever reason, it’s also a major
obstacle for people who have been in
the same company for their entire lives,
who just happen to be born with some
condition that makes them more prone to
some illnesses.

4. Now forced to insure people with
pre-existing conditions, allow insurance
companies to charge people who smoke,
eat poorly, don’t exercise, and have adult
onset diabetes more for their unhealthy
behaviors to make up for the new costs.

5. Allow the states to keep their
Medicare dollars and spend them string
free; if the states are inept when it comes
to this issue, the federal government is

Under “Yates Wilburn is Salvation for American

Healthcare ” (patent pending, arrogance and self-

satisfaction included with purchase), you are re-

warded for having health insurance.
 

ed and horrifying government run plan
(aargh!!!). What I’m saying is that we
can’t have 50 different sets of healthcare
laws and regulations that health insur-
ance companies have to follow indepen-
dently. The paperwork and lawyer fees
alone would cause costs to increase even
faster. There has to be a very basic set
of rules that insurance companies (note
I said nothing of requiring businesses of
over 50 employees to do anything, prob-
ably the worst part of Obamacare) every-
where would have to follow, if the states
want to add something on, they are more
than welcome.

IfI had to come up with a plan to ﬁx
healthcare in America, it would be very
simple, and it would include the follow-
ing and only the following:

1. Cap malpractice lawsuit damages
at $1 million plus health costs as a result
of said malpractice. This is more than
enough to cover the physical, legal, and
emotional damage caused by a case of
malpractice.

2. Allow (or force, pick your poison)
health insurance companies to compete
nationally. Meaning, ifl live in SC, I can

both clueless and inept.

6. Finally, and I’ll probably get
kicked out of the College Republicans
for this, you’ve got to create an incentive
for everyone in America to get health in-
surance. I’d suggest a tax credit for peo-
ple with insurance, and people without it
don’t get said credit.

My fellow Republicans would call
this a mandate. That’s ﬁne. They’ll have
to call tax credits and subsidies for fu-
el-efﬁcient cars, natural gas powered
vehicles, energy efficient appliances,
“Cash-for-Clunkers,” bio—fueIs (a com-

plete joke), and forced ethanol infusion

in gasoline mandates as well.

“But that’s different,” you’re shout-
ing to yourself. “You can avoid purchas-
ing those items! You aren’t forced to do
anything in those instances!” Same here,
nothing changes for people without in-
surance, it’s just people who have it that
get a tax credit. You are perfectly free to
kick death in the kneecaps when you are
healthy, and then go crying and sniﬁiing
to the ER when you aren’t. This is exact-
ly how the “mandate” was implemented
in Massachusetts under Mitt Romney.

What’s that? You say it’s just like
Obamacare? Wrong again, faceless op-
ponent. This is the exact opposite of
the Obamacare mandate. Under Obam-
acare, you are penalized for not hav-
ing health insurance, much like you are
for not wearing your seatbelt. Under

“Yates Wilbum’s Salvation for Ameri-
can Healthcare” (patent pending, arro-
gance and self-satisfaction included with
purchase), you are rewarded for having
health insurance. That isn’t unconstitu-
tional in my opinion.

Just so we don’t get mixed up, let’s
call my version (which I totally stole
from my choice for president, Mitt Rom-
ney) the “individual bonus.”

Call it what you want, it’s what is
needed. You can’t solve the problem of
thousands of people without insurance
running to the emergency room for free
care without this clause. People like this
cost hospitals and state governments bil-
lions of dollars every year, and force in-
.surance companies to pay higher prices
for medical care to make up for it. This
is passed on to policyholders, who are
forced to pay higher and higher prices
for insurance each month. Furthermore,

if you want to maintain a private, capi- 

talist healthcare system, you can’t ask
insurance companies to take everyone
who’s got the cash without giving an ex-
panded pool of potential customers.

Surprisingly enough, many of my fel-
low GOPers are (or at least were) sup-
porters of the “individual mandate,” as it
stands in Obamacare. Including:

Newt Gingrich, post-Congress right
up until he felt like running for President
(Washington Post, “Newt’s Changing
Stance on Healthcare Mandates”).

He even said in a speech in 2008,
“The third thing I think you have to do,
which is for a conservative a little con-
troversial, is I think you’ve got to require
everybody to either have insurance or to
post a bond,” and that it is “immoral” for
someone to gamble with their healthcare.
There are a half a dozen other instances
where he supported the idea of an indi-
vidual mandate (The Blaze, “2008 video
surfaces of Gingrich supporting health-
care mandate”).

petition with a Democratic reform plan

And of course Mitt Romney sup-
porting the “individual bonus” in 1994
and today (Washington Post, “A Lot of
Republicans Supported the Individual
Mandate”).

The tactic of using the courts and the
10th amendment against Obamacare is
not rooted in ideology (at least not that
of the GOP), but nothing more than
the realization that it was the only way
in hell that they could knock down the
law. I’d bet you next term’s tuition that
if you were to sit every Republican law-
maker down in a soundproof room and
inject them with truth serum, at least
75% percent would say they don’t actu-
ally care that the individual mandate as
written in Obamacare violates the 10th
amendment (which it totally does in my
opinion). The “individual bonus” on the
other hand, does not because it does not
force anyone to do anything at the fed-
eral level.

To be clear, I am not out to get the
Republican Party (my party), nor am I
out to get the Democratic Party. Due to
the fact that no one really cares what I
say or think, I get to tell the truth about
the “individual mandate” without conse-
quences (minus the likelihood of losing
my run for Junior Class Representative
in the College Republicans, of course),
something that Republican lawmakers
today must not do in the name of po-
litical expediency. Still, of all of them
I think Mitt Romney and Ron Paul are
being the most honest about this issue,
considering Mitt Romney refuses to
apologize for the “individual bonus” in
his state (though he has suffered for his
previous support for a nationwide ver-
sion), and Ron Paul has always been a
constitutional perfectionist.

So, the next time you see Mitt Rom-
ney, Newt Gingrich, or Rick Santorum
call someone else on that stage a ﬂip-
ﬂopper on this issue, remember that only
Ron Paul has been consistent enough to
make that charge free of hypocrisy.

A look into W&L’s “Gender Game”

Francesca Wilson encourages girls to command more respect from boys

in order to balance out the skewed
gender dynamics that have come to
characterize W&L’s social world.
For example, many chauvinistic
traditions

A strong Greek
system fosters a cul-
ture of cliques. In
terms of sororities,
girls become irra-
tionally competitive
during recruitment
and often times this
sentiment colors the entire aca-
demic year. As far as the fraternities
go, the boys seem to have slightly
less obsessive competition com-
plexes yet they certainly put eﬂbrt
into one-upping each other with
themed parties and the most ridicu-
lous pledge tasks. However, many
boys seem to change when they are
in the presence of a large group of
their fraternity brothers. Fraternities
seem to inspire a particularly strong
group mentality that can inﬂuence
its members. Throughout my time
at W&L. I have heard the phrase,
“pledging such and such a frat
completely changed him,” when a
newly pledged or initiated frater-
nity boy suddenly changes the way
he is acting towards a girl. Girls are
constantly blaming a boy’s friends,

Girls are constantly blaming a boy is friends, his liv-
ing situation and the pack—like dynamic of his fra-
ternity for their relationship problems.
 

validity in these statements, the cul-
ture of chauvinism is so ingrained
within this community that it isn’t
worth the female students time to
try and re-write the history of the
university. Sexism is an established
current within W&L and only time
will tell if the institution will ever
truly be able to shake this negative
reality.

Therefore, I implore the female
community of W&L to both stop
making excuses for and to stop
blaming the “gentlemen” of our
campus for all of our own trials and
tribulations. We’re giving them too
much credit. If we blame men for
our problems we’re automatically
handing them authority and control.
Instead, there needs to exist an even
split of authority on this campus

are far too
accepted by
the women
of W&L,
such as the
annual Jello
Wrestling
Competi-
tion. As far as I know, the females
who participate in this crude event
sign a consent form. .. but seriously,
why on earth are sorority women
pledging their support of such a
crude and degrading event?

In essence, boys treat girls badly
on our college campus (and proba-
bly every other campus in America)
because girls allow them to. Sure,
the fraternity system has many sex-
ist qualities, but that’s something
we already know and it isn’t going
anywhere. Therefore, it’s up to the
women of this community to make
the changes, to disregard the male
hyperbole, and ultimately to com-
mand more personal respect.

 edly unpleasant.

is different. For
those of you_who are uninitiated, Group
Exercise is a service offered by W&L.
It consists of exercise classes offered at
various times during the day in variotis
physical disciplines. There are a lot of
reasons forjoining.

For one, it makes you just one step
closer to actually fulﬁlling your New
Year’s Resolutions (remember those‘?).
Even just swiping home the $100 fee for
a semester is a great conﬁdence booster.

You don’t even have to attend the classes
-- just the intention to do so makes you
feel like a better person.

But then, there actually are reasons
for wanting to go to the classes. First,
the instructors are great. They range
from the very upbeat (see: Sport Circuit
and Body Sculpt) to the earthy and hip-
pie (see Pilates and Yoga). Then there is
Rob. Rob Benevento. Rob makes these
classes so much better. He is Italian and
young and buff He plays the unedited
versions of all the best songs. His classes
are very popular.

One ofthe classes Rob teaches is Cy-
cling. Cycling class takes place on the
landing above the gym. It also happens
to take place at exactly the same time the
boys’ basketball team practices down
below. Contrary to popular opinion, we
women do not go to this class simply to
watch the boys practice. Just thought I
would clear that up.

That wouldn’t be such a bad reason
for going though, as boys are very rare
in Group Exercise. I guess the idea of
doing jumping jacks in unison to Mi-

ley Cyrus somehow just doesn”t appeal
to the male sex. I know of only three
brave souls who have broken this tradi-
tion. There is Professor Velasquc/.. who
regularly attends yoga. If you know Pro-

see him struggling to ﬁt his body into a

fessor Velasquez!”

Zumba class was also graced with a
surprise male presence this past week.

popular hip-hop beats. It is yer-y popu-
Iar with women. This past 'l'litirsday the

inal, straight, W&L guy who does yoga?
Does this exist‘? Like I said, he is a bit of
a mystery. Iﬁitlier way. he certainly must
liavc balls.

' Yoga is actually a bit of a mystery
itself. I had never gone until this past se-
mester. It was a bit unnerving. First the
iiistriictor or “guru” turned out the light.
(Um. ok.) Then he proceeded to take us
through a series ofcontoitions that make
my body htirt just to think about. The

  A step towards a six-pack

consistent part of the class is that he
frequently, at least twenty times a class,
reminds us to “blossom our buttocks”
when doing poses. Those are his exact
words. I have never ﬁgured out exactly
what this means, and am not sure I care
to know. A

Regardless, Group Exercise is a lot of
fun. The only downside? Unless you’re
a real exercise freak, you don’t get to
do the people-watching that naturally

accompanies any trip to the gym. What .

a shame. I too once thought grunting
loudly while lifting heavy objects would
attract members of the opposite sex.
Still, Group Exercise is worth it. It is
fun. lt’s a way to get ﬁt. You get to watch
the basketball team. (Ok, it’s not why
we go but that doesn’t mean we don’t
occasionally glance down.) So whether
male or female, you shouldjoin. Iimean
what other chance are you going to get to
“blossom your buttocks” in public?

Dear itor,

While reading the last edition of the
Ring-Tum Phi, I was pleasantly sur-
prised to ﬁnd the article, “Analyzing
Gender Relations,” in which Francesca
Wilson calls attention to issues of gen-
der relations on the W&L campus. While
she ends her article with the promise of
future discussions about these issues in
her column, I would like to call attention
to some of the causes of gender discrimi-
nation on campus. The gender divide at
W&L exists, and I feel that W&L women
are oftentimes actively participating in
perpetuating negative gender roles and
stereotypes. I often read articles in the
Phi that exhibit underlying gender is-
sues, and this past weeks Phi was not an
exception.

I was quite shocked after reading
the aiticle from Campbell Burr entitled.
“From free beer to slavery: four stages of
brotherhood,” which is clearly written to
W&L women so that they will know how

GREG USSERY/ staff cartoonist

 

they "should expect to interact with the
boys at each stage” ofjoining the Greek
system. While the article is intended to
impart a description of the changing at-
titudes of freshman boys before and after
pledgeship. it says far more about per-
petuating gender roles that W&L women
often enforce themselves.

The description in the article about
how freshmen try to win the respect of
upperclassmcn displays blatant objec-
tification of women as a means to win
merit in the Greek system. Burr imparts
that boys will get points for “the number
of girls "ve hooked up with," or ifa

, oinething along the lines of,
‘I like k ida saw her bra’.” While that
may be considered an objective portrait
_- I ip. Burr imparts an important

iey ha\-'e been through a lot and

These are not the type of men that de-

not place their respect in men that sexu-
alize women to get ahead in a fraternity,
nor should they offer the “occasional
laundry service” to boys who will be-
come cocky and bigoted once they end
pledgeship. Giving respect to these men
is telling them that they can treat women
however they want, thus enforcing gen-
der discrimination.

Also, saying that “pledge brothers
become absurdly close. closer than they
could become singing songs and baking
cookies together” undermines relation-
ships that W&L women build with one
another just because women do not un-
dergo pledgeship. Women can have ex-
tremely close relationships without hav-

“slavery.”

Mesmerizing music, colorful cos-
tumes, and captivating choreography
swept audiences away as the interna-
tionally renowned River North Dance
Chicago Company captured the spot-
light with a packed performance at the
Keller Theater. The sold-out produc-
tion attracted students, faculty, and local
community members for an evening of
vibrant acts and rousing pieces this past
Tuesday.

The night featured a variety of differ-
ent works and styles, ranging from the
powerful arrangement, Sentir em Nos

The annual competition beneﬁts local food banks; Pi Kappa Phi wins this year ’s competition

New members of Pi Kappa Phi
ﬂipped their way to ﬁrst place at the an-
nual Lip Sync competition. A Chi Ome-
ga group took second place, dancing to a
mash up of popular songs.

Andrea Siso, part of the Chi 0 group,
said, “we had a lot of fun dancing for a
good cause.”

Proceeds from tickets and group
entry fees beneﬁt the Students Against

performance was unique in that each
dance piece offered either a scenic el-
ement with some sort of set piece or
strong visual elements with lighting.
Bold, saturated colors were used, light
was formed into speciﬁc shapes, gobos
were used to create designs on the stage.
The layering of the visual effects gave
the show a rock concert type aura.”

The highlights ofthe production were

ground of structured improvisation.

Washington and Lee students packed

SAIL update on foreign aid

$2000 goes a long way in Kyrgyzstan, a county ravished by recent ethnic conﬂict and perpetual poverty

By Travis Wakeman
5 TA F F w R IT E R

Last year Student Association for In-
ternational Learning sent $2000 in relief
aid to Kyrgyzstan for ethnic conﬂicts
suffered June 2010. On Friday, Bermet
Zhumakadyrkyzy ‘ 11 returned to Wash-
ington and Lee to tell how the funds
collected by SAIL were spent and offer
more information about the current sta-
tus of her country.

The contributions from W&L were
given to the Unity Fund, part of the
American Council for International Edu-
cation (ACTR/ACCELS). Bermet said,
“They were so surprised. . .they basically
got money from somewhere they didn’t
expect to get it. They were so grateful.”

Two grand might not seem like a lot
of aid, but with the exchange rate (1 USD

= 46 SOM) and the lower cost of living
in Kyrgyzstan, SAlL’s donation went a
long way. The majority of aid was used
to purchase medical supplies for a chil-
dren’s treatment center in the city ofOsh.
A modest remainder of funds was used
to help buy prizes for a children’s soccer
tournament at a reformation school.
Most of the children become petty
criminals to help feed their families.
Bermet explained, “They thought they
would organize the soccer tournament as
a symbol that you can win in a fair game.
You don’t have to lie, cheat, or steal.”
Belek lbraev, another Kyrgyzstan
citizen studying at W&L. talked about
his personal reaction to the killings.
“When‘I saw my country on the news, I

was already sure that something was go-
ing wrong. I never saw signs of ethnic
clashes.”

The violence is closely tied to the
forced removal in April 2010 of the sit-
ting Kyrgyz President, Kurmanbek Baki-
yev. He was forced to resign after popu-

' lar demonstrations against him turned

violent. A provisional government was
established but couldn’t control the vio-
lence that ﬂared up for several days in
the southern regions between the Uzbek
and Kyrgyz ethnic groups. Ofﬁcial re-
ports estimate 3000 people were killed.
Actual fatalities were probably higher
because the statistics fail to include those
laid to rest by their own families.

Belek pointed out how poverty might

have also been a factor.

“Many people have asked me who is
responsible for it and whose fault it is. I
would never blame any of the sides be-
cause most of the people who live there
are desperate. They live in poverty 24
hours a day, they work for ten dollars or
less than that a day, so they are constant-
ly in deprivation,” said Belek. “In any
society during harsh times it is easy for
people to blame other people with differ-
ent backgrounds.” ‘

Fortunately there is some hope for
a brighter future with the ﬁrst peaceful
transition of presidential power in Kyr-
gyz history. Roza Otunbayeva became
Central Asia’s ﬁrst female president in
history in 2010.

For Belek this is very signiﬁgantf
“For me this was a sign of Kyrgystan be-
coming a true liberal democracy, a mod-
em state. Whenever I would have talks
with my friends I would emphasize that
she is a woman.”

Bermet said he hopes that with this
transition the future will be brighter for
her people, “People I think are a bit tired
of expecting or hoping, they are just
waiting to see what happens, but at the
same time, people want something good
to happen. We are not all skeptical, we
are optimistic, but not over optimistic...
In any country you always hope for the
better.”

Pop art prevails in Staniar

Andy Warhol and works inspired by the well-known artist are part of an extensive art donation to serveral universities

By Ryan Johnson
5 TA F F w R l T E R

Staniar Gallery kicked off 2012 with
an ambitious collection of works by
Andy Warhol. “In the Event of Andy
Warhol” is a collection of Warhol Pola-
roid’s and works inspired by the artist,
including a ﬁlm by the Washington and
Lee Student Arts League.

W&L invited Warhol scholar Stephen
Petersen to speak Wednesday night on
the history of the art. Peterson chronicled
the photographic methods of Warhol.

Though he took up photography late
in his life, Warhol made tens of thou-
sands of photographs. He enjoyed work-
ing with simplistic , auto-focus and Po-
laroid cameras because of their universal
appeal.

“I think anybody can take a good pic-
ture,” Warhol once said. A

Some of his most impactful pho-
tographs are his Polaroid portraits of
famous celebrities; movie stars, poli-
ticians, and athletes. In each case. he
would take hundreds of pictures, subtly
adjusting for light and angle, of celebri-
ties. With these Iportraits he was aiming
for a uniform glamour; “I try to make
everybody look great.” Ironically, these
portraits are often likened to yearbook
or passport photos. He did thousands of
these photography sessions, charging as
much as $25,000 for the opportunity.

Warhol also made about 20,000
prints from 35mm ﬁlm, some of which

are on display in the gallery.

These photos are often simple, and
Warhol printed 21 photo multiple times to
form grid-like structures, just as in some
of his famous screen prints.

He was obsessed with the automation
involved with point-and-shoot cameras,
buying the newest models as they ar-
rived.

Many of his photographs would
have gone unseen but for the Andy
Warhol Photographic Legacy Program,
launched in 2007. The program donated
more than 28,000 Warhol photographs
to various galleries, museums, and uni-
versities across the country.

W&L, Roanoke College, and Hollins

each received more than 150 photos and
a collaboration of the three collections
is on view. The high-proﬁle donation is
a treasure to students and faculty alike.
Sophomore Hank Hill said that he is,
“thrilled to have the works of a modern
master” in the gallery.

W&L students have a presence in the
exhibition. The Student Arts League put
together a “screen test” video like those
of Andy Warhol, in which participants
would sit facing a camera for several
minutes.

Other works in the exhibit are in-
spired by the work of Andy Warhol.
Shepard Fairey, the famed street artist
behind the Obama “HOPE” posters, is

the creator of one piece and is featured
in another by California artist Piper Fer-
guson

Junior Anthony Kirby said he was
impressed by the “sheer amount of work
that went into Warhol’s photographs.”

“In the Event of Andy Warhol” will
be «showing through Feb. 4, and gal-
lery hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday
through Friday. A modiﬁed version of
the show will be on view at Roanoke
College beginning in March and at Hol-
lins beginning in May.

5 - THE RING-TUM PHI -

 

ANDREW REL 'ALl)0

Super Bowl XLVI should be a close, even, and entertaining
game. A case could be made for either side to emerge victori-
ous, and so I feel compelled to turn to unconventional analysis
to decide my winner. In short, the New England Patriots will
win Super Bowl XLVI simply because they have Tom Brady.

First things ﬁrst: Tom Brady has returned to short-cropped
hair and the Patriots are back in the Super Bowl. Coincidence?

S'l‘EPIlEl ’ PECK

I’ve given up trying to ﬁgure out who the New York Giants
really are.

They went a mediocre 9-7 in the regular season, and were
swept‘in their season series with the lowly Washington Red-
skins. They have a below-average secondary (albeit decimated
by injuries), a thin linebacking corps, and a pedestrian running

After tearing ligaments in his knee and missing the 2008 sea-
son, Brady began tapping into his inner Fabio in 2009. His hair
continued to grow, culminating in an egregiously long mane
during the 2010 season that can only be described as a ﬁrst-
quarter-of-life-crisis. The hard-working folks in Fall Rivuh and
Charlestown began wondering if their franchise quarterback
had gone too Hollywood. Alas, Brady did the sensible thing in

they don’t even make the playoffs.

And yet they have won ﬁve straight games, all of the “win-
or-go-home” variety, dating back to week 16 against the Jets.
In their past two games, the Giants have beaten the NFL’s best

all the way and had to come from behind. They played on a
frozen tundra and a rain-soaked mud ﬁeld.

2011 and returned to the shorter hair with which he won three
Super Bowls. Bostonians rejoiced, and the Pats are back in the big game.

Brady’s knee injury brings me to my next point: Brady is exorcising the Patriots” demons
this season. To book their place in the Super Bowl, Brady and the Pats beat the Ravens, a
team featuring Bernard Pollard. Pollard, as all Pats fans know, was the player who crashed
into Brady’s leg in "2008, ending the franchise quarterback’s season. This happened in the
Pats’ ﬁrst game after Super Bowl XLII, in which the New York Giants-wthe Pats’ Super Bowl
XLVI opponent-ruined their perfect season. These two events cursed the franchise, as the
team failed to win a playoff game until this season. Now, after beating Pollard and the Ra-
vens’ tough defense (Ravens fans, which was more likely? Billy C undiff missing a 32-yard
chip—shot, or Joe Flacco leading the Ravens to Super Bowlglory while earnestly sporting a
foo—manshu? I’d say the former.) Brady is ready to overcome the Giants’ fearsome pass rush
featuring Jason Pierre—Paul, Osi Umenyiora, and Justin Tuck’s facemask. That this Pats sea-
son coincided with the release of that creepy new exorcism movie must be a sign, and Brady
will bring his team’s cathartic journey full—circle by beating the Giants.

Some may argue that Giants’ quarterback Eli “Earl” Manning is playing better than Brady
right now, but Brady is still the best QB of our time. Manning may have a Super Bowl ring,
but Brady has three. Manning may have a few humorous ads with his brother Peyton, but
Brady is regularly featured in People magazine. Manning may have ﬁnally cemented his
claim to “elite” status, but Brady is still polishing his decade-long legacy. And as for their
prestigious WAGS—Manning may be married to a girl you can probably find in a Delta Delta
Delta composite on the Ole Miss campus or heading to a Junior League near you, but Brady
is married to an intemationally-acclaimed supermodel. Brady edges Manning in just about
any statistical or shallow/superficial category. So while Manning may be in the form of his
life, I am still choosing Brady to win a one-off game for all the marbles.

Even using more conventional analyses, the Patriots still look like a safe bet to- win. Be-
sides Brady, the Pats have Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez, two of the best and most
athletic tight ends in the NFL. The NFL is about matchups, and these guys create matchup
problems for every team. The Pats also have Bill Belichiek, likely an evil genius, as their
coach. Their defense worries me, but they still have the force that is Vince Wilfork on the
defensive line. Brandon Spikes is playing better at linebacker despite his poor decisions on
Chat Roulette, and Devin McCourty headed up a secondary that contained the great Ravens
receiver Anquan Boldin in their last game. Throw a dash of these elements in with a big help-
ing of Brady mystique, and I think you’ll see why the New England Patriots will win Super
Bowl XLVI.

They suddenly have an unstoppable pass rush, playmaking
wide receivers, and a red-hot quarterback who has proven time
and time again that he has earned the mystical distinction of being called “elite.”

The New York Football Giants look like world—beaters now. And they could not be peak-
ing at a better time.

The G-Men match up exceptionally well with New England. Both teams are going to
throw the ball. It’s what they do. And even going against the immortal Tom Brady, I think
the Giants will be able to throw it better.

, Eli has better weapons at his disposal. With teams (ﬁnally) making concerted efforts to
slow down Victor Cruz, Hakeem Nicks has stepped up in a big way. Throw in Mario Man-
ningham as the third receiver and the speedy Ahmad Bradshaw out ofthe backﬁeld, and the
Giants have a passing attack to be reckoned with. Match them up against a New England
secondary that ranked second to last in terms of opponents passing yards and the Patriots
could be in for a long day. New England’s defense has had the beneﬁt of facing two quar-
terbacks so far in the playoffs, Tim Tebow and Joe Flacco, who aren’t anywhere near the
talent level of Manning. They could be in for a long day.

On the other side of the ball. it’s no secret that Tom Brady will throw and throw some
more. And as we saw in Super Bowl XLII, the Giants pass rush was all it took to knock
Brady offhis game.

Can’t you see this year’s Super Bowl play out exactly the same way as the last time
these two teams met in the Big Game? Can’t you see Osi Umenyiora and Justin Tuck harass
Brady into a few key turnovers? Can’t you see Eli engineering a late scoring drive to ce-
ment his status as the premier clutch quarterback in the league? Can’t you see Eli grab the
Super Bowl MVP award and yell “Peyton Who?!” into the mic?

The last one may be wishful thinking, but the fact of the matter is we have seen this
scenario play out before.

As Peter King pointed out, in 2007 the Giants beat an NFC South opponent in the wild
card round. They beat the number one seed in the divisional round. And then beat the num-
ber two seed in the conference title game when the opponent turned the ball over and set up
Lawrence Tynes for a game winning kick to send the G-Men to the Super Bowl against the
Pats. And we all know how that game turned out. '

This year? The Giants beat an NFC South team in round one, beat the number one seed
in round two, and beat the number two seed in round three when San Fran turned it over in
overtime. '

At this point it’s not even a prediction, it’s destiny. Giants 24-Patriots l7.

21. Senior guard Meg Ingram responded with
a three—pointer pulling the Generals within
two points of the Marlins.

Sarah Seipp, a first year guard for the Mar-
lins, was fouled on a layup and took advan-
tage of the opportunity for a three-point play.
Senior guard Kari Ann Pfannestein added a
layup for the Generals, but the Marlins sank
two more from the foul line before the half
ended, giving Virginia Wesleyan a 31-26 lead
over W&L.

The Generals were able to close the score
to a two point game at 7:31 in the second half
off of a layup from junior forward Katy Wil-
son. However,’ the Marlins’ fast paced game
allowed them to keep the lead.

The Marlins outrebounded the Generals
38-35 and shot 94.7% (18-19) from the line
while the Generals had only 44.4% (4-9) suc-
cess from the line. Three members of the
Marlins lineup contributed points in the dou-
ble digits. »

Becca Bolton, a senior forward for the
Generals, netted 13 points, ﬁve assists, and 11
rebounds while Ingram led the Generals with
21 points. 1

The Generals return to action this Saturday
at 4:00 pm on the road as they face Emory &

Strong performances by Whitaker, McLean, ana’ Ey leaa’ W&L over E&H

By Evelyn Norton
STA F F W R l T E R

Sometimes delivering a beating on a Satur-
day makes winning on the following Wednes-
day that much harder, especially when statis-
tics reason this one will be a shoe-in.

Last Wednesday night would be the 61st
time in history the Washington and Lee Gen-
erals would gently set the Emory and Henry
Wasps back into their cribs and say good
night. Lights out.

It would mirror the last ﬁve meetings ofthe
two programs—all ﬁve wins for the Generals.

Or would it‘?

As the seconds ticked away to half time
no one was sure, not sure enough to put any
money on it at least.

So far W&L’s defense was consistently
one step behind, allowing Emory and‘Henry
the extra second to get shots off. Fortunately
in the second half there was a new team, one
who relieved the crown from continuously

crying out, “whose man is that?”

Larry Whitaker came out to ﬁght, secur-
ing the ﬁrst basket in of the second half and
bringing the lead back to the Generals’ hands.
Whitaker went on to drive again at the 16:14
minute marker and brought the Generals up
to a seven-point lead, the largest of the night

-posted by either team.

Just over a minute later Emory and Henry
was forced to call a timeout while the Wash-
ington and Lee students took a dance break,
waving their arms to the YMCA.

Turns out the Generals did want it, and as
for the fans, well, who doesn’t want to dance?

Whitaker was not the only man grabbing
the crowd’s attention; Clay McLean was
fouled on the made basket and an elderly gen-
tleman behind the Generals’ bench exclaimed,
“McLean, you animal!” McLean went on to
lead the Generals in scoring with 15 points,

with Whitaker and JD. Ey closely behind
posting 14 and 13 points, respectively.

With less than ﬁve minutes to play in the
game, Malcolm Green delivered a foul that
sent Ey into the Wasps bench. The crowd
exploded, demanding an intentional foul that
they would never see called. Suddenly every-
one cared, all dancingjokes aside. This was an
occasion for yelling (unless you were the girl
in the white l0ng—sleeve shirt in love with your
phone—you know who you are). \

Goat noises emerged from an unknown
source amongst the students as the Wasps
tried to at least get a free throw in, but they
could not handle the barnyard any longer. The
Generals gallantly galloped away with a 67-46
win, outscoring the Wasps 33-1 1 in the second
half.

share dreams

Career Services hosts

documentary screening
By Tilden Bowditch

‘STAFF WRITER

After graduating in 2009, Alexis Irvin and Chip
Hiden quit their desk jobs bought a ﬂip-cam and tri-
pod and set off on a road trip that they hoped would
change their lives- and hopefully, they say, the life of
any college student with a dream.

Career Services hosted a screening of their docu-
mentary The Dream Share Project, in Stackhouse The-
ater on Tuesday, Jan. 31.

The documentary follows Irvin and Hiden on a
cross-country road trip as they interview people who
do what they love. In the ﬁlm, Irvin and Hiden ask
professors, entrepreneurs, and celebrities about the
meaning of success, risk-taking, and the rewards of
pursuing a dream.

“We wanted to take a road trip but we wanted to
make it more than a road trip. We wanted to do some-
thing that would make a difference,” Irvin said.

Over a span of three months, the two drove from
Maryland to California and back again, interviewing a
variety of professors, entrepreneurs, artists, and more.

In the ﬁlm, Irvin and Hiden explain how they stum-
bled across interesting characters to interview. Some
of these included a young CEO of an eco-friendly
ﬂip ﬂop company, a comedian from the original Latin
Kings of Comedy, and a Project Runway fashion de-
signer.

Neither Irvin nor Hiden knew much about making
documentaries before they embarked on their jour-
ney. Irvin studied print journalism at the University
of Maryland, and Hiden majored in history at Wash-
ington College. They used ﬂip-cams and a tripod to
record the interviews.

Washington and Lee University was the second of
35 colleges Irvin and Hiden will visit on their spring
tour. The two are showing their documentary to col-
lege students to inspire young people in taking risks
and pursuing dreams.

The screening at W&L was poorly attended. Only.

two or three students and a handful of Lexington resi-
dents came.

Stephen Twining, a junior at W&L, says he saw
notices on campus and thought the ﬁlm looked inter-
esting.

Twining called the ﬁlm as “eye-opening,” He said
it gave a realistic perspective of what it means to fol-
low a dream instead of taking the safe route.

“It didn’t glamorize it, but it deﬁnitely challenged
social norms and the pressures from society to do the
safe thing,” Twining said. ‘

“The ﬂip-ﬂop guy, for example, he didn’t have a
plan but just took risks and made some big moves and
it led to him ﬁnally discovering a really cool opportu-
nity,” Twining said

The ﬁlm encouraged young people to take big risks,
to step out of their comfort zones and to do something
they love.

Irvin said they are working on a book proposal
for the fall. “It’ll be a self-help guide for college-age
people.”

W&L sustainability committee wonders how new land can e used educationally

ByTommy Kent
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee University’s
purchase of Warner Farm, a tract of
land contiguous to back campus, has
led to discussion by members of the
Sustainability Committee and other
faculty on how to use the land. Be-
cause more than half of the land is
under a conservation easement, the
types of activities that can take place
are limited.

The land, purchased in Decem-
ber 2010, consists of approximately
89 acres of land divided into 4 par-
cels. According to the Rockbridge
Country GIS website, the total val-
ue of Warner Farm, also known as
Peniel Farm, is around $299,000,
with improvements adding another
$828,600.

Although discussion still con-
tinues long after its purchase on the
various ways to use the property, the
reason for the buy arose from the op-
portunities that it presented.

Steve McAllister, the Treasurer
and Vice President for Finance, said,
“The majority of the University’s
property is ‘land-locked’ and sur-
rounded by small individual parcels
that create a challenge economically
and politically to acquire for purpos-
es of ‘banking’ land for future use.
There simply is no other proximate
parcel to the University that provides
the quality and quantity of land that
the Warner property brings to the
University.

Approximately 69 acres of the
property is under a conservation
easement, prompting many to won-
der how the school can make effec-
tive use of the area.

“The conservation easement per-
petually protects the property from
any further state of development,”
Jill Fraley, a property professor at the
law school, said.

Easements are often put around
rivers in order to protect the view
and prevent non-point source water
pollution, such as land run-off from
grazing cattle, F raley said. Although
roads and buildings cannot be built
within the easement, recreational ac-
tivities and farming are permitted.

According to geology professor
David Harbor, the conservation ease-
ment has led to the question of what
can be done on the property and dis-

cussion by the sustainability commit-

tee. The committee, which includes
Prof. William Hamilton, Chris Wise,
Fraley, and James Dick, is working
on coming up with ways to use the
land at Warner Farm.

According to Harbor, discussion
is important. “I want people to start
thinking about land-use,” he said. He
said he wants to try and get students
to visit the property during the spring
and wants the local community to
think about sustainability.

Dick, director of campus rec-
reation, said there will have to be a

compromise on everyone’s part in
deciding on what to do with the land
and also mentioned the importance
of focusing on the short-terrn.

“For the ﬁrst 1-3 years, it is go-
ing to be: what is the easiest thing
to pick from the tree. All of these
low-hanging fruit items are the most
obtainable; it takes nothing to use
the property to go out and star-gaze
or to mark trails. All it takes is for
people to buy-in,” Dick said. He said
the ideas are endless and suggested
mountain biking, hiking, camping,
use of the water access for canoes,
tree identiﬁcation, teaching and gar-
dening.

Hamilton said he would like to use
the land for summer research, specif-
ically about the ecological questions
brought up by grazing and fecal con-
tamination in local waterways. He
also said, in theory, the compost fa-
cilities and campus garden could be
relocated to the property.

According to Wise, the Environ-
mental Management Coordinator,
W&L has had experience with prop-
erty like this before. Skylark, a 365
acre farm on the Blue Ridge Parkway
about 40 minutes from campus, was
formally owned by the University
but was sold in the fall of 2010 due
to its limited use and cost of main-
tenance. The site was used a confer-
ence center, but wasn’t used much as
an educational opportunity.

“[The Warner F ann] deﬁnitely
has the possibility for education and
research that we were thinking about
doing with Skylark,” Wise said.

Laura Henry Stone, a professor of
environmental studies, also support-
ed this idea of possibilities. She said
she would like to see the land used
for teaching sustainability skills, es-
pecially regarding agriculture. She
said growing food is a good way for
students to see their connection to the
natural world and the importance of
land to a species.

Henry-Stone said, “Planning for
sustainability is about taking advan-
tage of opportunities. A lot of col-
leges are obtaining property like this.

‘It is sort of a national conversation

about how to use the land. It is not
an unusual approach. I think what I
am most excited about is starting a
campus—wide conversation about the
best way to be stewards of the land.”

“There are opportunities for ev-
eryone. These are all ideas. If every-
one can agree on an idea, then it will
get done. Who knows where it will
go from there?” Wise said.

The O strich Doctrine

Columnist Yates Wilburn comments on the United State is tenden

In recent
weeks, Chinese
. oppression in
Tibet has been
in the news more
often than nor-
mal. Two things
have brought
this common oc-
currence to the
front of inter-
national media:
I) The Tibetan
New Year is
coming up, 2) a
local I Buddhist
monk set himself on ﬁre calling for the
return of the Dalai Lama and the end of
the Chinese occupation of the country.
This is not a new form of protest; it was
used to set off the Arab Spring last year
in Tunisia. However, it has been a while
since Tibet has been in the forefront of
global discussion, so it is unique in that
regard. This all plays into a discussion

eac _::time, the police agency would say

 e “was too late” and that they “al—

'“Ci1s'®.” According to Wu, Cisco signed
multiple deals with many provincial
 departments across China, pro-

Chinese authorities has allowed the CCP
to re-write history by nearly completely
erasing the Tiananmen Square massa-
cre of 1989 from the national memory,
as the Frontline television program ex-
posed. The Frontline reporters gathered
four students from Beijing University
and showed them the iconic picture of
the “Tank Man” to see if they could
recognize the picture and the event it
symbolized. However, as stated by the
program’s narrator, “they were bafﬂed.”
The students thought the picture de-
picted everything from a “military cer-
emony” to a “piece of artwork.” One
student even asked the interviewer, “Did
you make this up?” (Thomas, Anthony,
“Frontline: The Tank Man”).

Cisco Systems, however, is by far the
biggest culprit in this incredible conspir-
acy. Cisco is no stranger to controversy,

     

McCraw responds to the $4

“ written statement to Frontline, stating
hat it “sells identical products world-
ide” and that it is “the customer, not
Cisco who determines how speciﬁc ca-
pabilities will be used” (Thomas, Antho-
ny, “Frontline: The Tank Man”).
However, this claim was largely
debunked in 2008, when Wired News
journalist Sarah Lai Stirland reported
on a leaked Cisco internal document,
which displayed “Cisco engineers re-
garded the Chinese govemment’s rigid
intemet censorship program as an op-
portunity to do more business with the
repressive regime.” The document was
a PowerPoint presentation dated 2002,
that outlined how Cisco may service
the needs of the Chinese govemment’s
attempts to upgrade its censorship capa-
bilities. A particular part of the presenta-
tion highlighted by Stirland was under
the heading “Cisco Opportunities” that
“provides bulletpoint suggestions for
how it might service China’s censor-
ship system” (Sarah Lai Stirland, “Cisco

' .= * mas, Anthony,

“Frontline: The  Man”). Although

the US government could not possibly‘

hope to actually force China to halt its
consistent violations of the human rights
of its citizens, either through bi-lateral
negotiations, or in one of many IGO’s as
stated earlier, it can halt its indirect par-
ticipation in the PRC’s efforts to crush
any and all resistance to the CCP’s au-
thority. Given the proactive nature of the
Obama administration in the recent rev-
olutions and revolts of the Arab Spring,
its silence over human rights violations
in China at the hands of US tech ﬁrms
serves as a black eye to the administra-
tion’s foreign policy legacy.

The participation of Western technol-
ogy ﬁrms in the Chinese govemment’s
upgrade and implementation of its new
media censorship programs is nothing
less than the participation in human
rights violations themselves. The sym-
biotic relationship that has developed
between the PRC and companies like
Google and Cisco Systems has carried
programs like Golden Shield to heights
and successes that quite possibly never
have been reached at the speed that they
were. Without Western tech assistance,
the PRC would have been forced to
bring its advanced new media censor-
ship and monitoring abilities (more than
simply blocking sites like Facebook, a
fairly simple task) into the 21st century
all by itself, being exposed to all the tri-
als and errors experienced by any new
program. If the failure of initiatives like
the Great Leap Forward are any indica-
tor, a program like Golden Shield could
have suffered severe setbacks during
development and implementation with-
out the aid of Western companies. For
pre-new media censorships, arrests, and
oppression, the CCP is to blame, but for
post-new media oppression, the respon-
sibility is shared by the CCP and by the
Western companies that capitulate to and
even aid the CCP’s efforts to put down
dissent and efforts for freedom.

that they can’t keep nature beau-

This seems like a stretch.

President Jimmy Carter once
said, “If we can teach our chil-
dren to honor nature’s gifts, the

will be here forever.”

So, the ‘Commonwealth of

an average individual income of

“line in the sand.” and the crowning glo-

This issue plagued candidates in past

There are a number of factors that

The most prevalent symptom of SAD
is the compulsion to keep on smiling.

What distinguishes SAD as such an

Take some time out for   self-reﬂection

Inspired by Henry David Thoreau, one »W&L senior has an idea to help the campus take a break from everyday stress

By Colleen Moore
STAFF warren

College students seem to exist in a
constant state of stress. Sometimes, we
need to take a step back from our school-
work, athletics or other obligations and
focus on ourselves. Outing Club senior,
Henri Hammond-Paul, has undertaken a
project to address this issue and in the
process bring students closer to nature.

A cabin is his answer: a place for self-
reﬂection, deep thinking and environ-
mental awareness. Located close enough
to be within walking distance of campus,
but far enough to feel surrounded by na-
ture, the cabin will be available to every
community member of W&L, staff and
students alike.

5:00 pm - 6:30 pm

Hammond-Paul said the cabin will
be a “detox in many ways.” It will re-
move people from the busy blursiof ev-
eryday life and offer a space to organize
thoughts or just clear heads.

W&L is able to offer unique opportu-
nities for interaction with its natural sur-
roundings, however many students do
not take advantage of these experiences.
Hammond-Paul wants “to incentivize in-

natural environment and hopes the cabin
can be a place to mend that division.
Inspired by his thesis on environmen-
talism and eco-social theory in the works
of Henry David Thoreau, Hammond-
Paul has a deep passion for the wilder-
ness. -He wants to share this passion,
something that has been so influential
in his personal growth, with the W&L
community to encourage them to grow

teraction with and contemplation of our xindividuallyas well.

place in the natural world by providing a
place that is readily available and easily
used by our community members.”

He said he has found that the mod-
em digital age separates people from the

,‘‘It is really important for people to
be able to escape, find solitude, and have
time to be alone and reflect,” he said.
The cabin will be a place to dojust that.

To self-reflect is to take the “time to

10:00 am - 11:30 am

10:00 am - 1:00 pm

think about who we are as individuals,
what we care about, what the implica-
tions of our actions are, and how we
should act,” said Hammond-Paul. The
next step would be to apply these revela-
tions to social interactions, environmen-
tal issues, humanitarian concerns and the
greater community at large.

Although Hammond-Paul is still in
the process of determining the exact lo-
cation of the cabin, he has been work-
ing with soine architecture students on
the design. With enough help from the
W&L community, ‘the project should
take about a month or even less to coin-
plete. He is excited about the experience

of building ~,“there is great merit in
academic learning, but experiential and
physical learning is something, that in
my opinion, is deeply undervalued.”
However this is not a project about
just one person ~ the whole W&L com-
munity needs to take ownership of the
cabin, as Hammond-Paul will be gradu-
ating in the spring. There is a place for
every discipline to take part in the proj-
ect, whether it’s the physical labor or
an administrative role. Hammond-Paul
encourages anyone to ﬁnd a way to get
involved. Contact him at hamm0nd-

With a barrage of threes setting the tone in
the second half, Randolph College expanded
a six point half-time lead to a 22 point victory
over Washington and Lee on Wednesday night
in an ODAC matchiip at the Warner Center.

The Randolph Wildcats shot an astounding
65 percent from the ﬁeld in the second half, in-
cluding 69 percent from behind the arc. Shoot-
ing percentages were the story of the game, as
the Generals shot only 22 percent from the
ﬂoon

After a ﬁrst half that only produced 36 to-
tal points, a 21 to 15 lead for Randolph, the
Wildcats came out on a 10 to 2 run to open the
second half.

The Generals could not keep up with the
excellent shooting displayed by Randolph,
as the six point deﬁcit at half was the closest
W&L ever got in the second half.

Nine successful three pointers keyed the
Wildcats to victory in the second half, as each
team took 13 attempts from long range in
the ﬁnal 20 minutes. The difference was ﬁve
shots, as the Generals only made four of their
thirteen attempts, compared to Randolph’s

nine.

Mike Ehilegbu and Chris Battaglia led the
way for Randolph in the second half, scoring
nine and eleven points respectively, coming off
the bench. Ehilegbu made three of ﬁve three-
point attempts in the half and scored eleven
points overall. Battaglia scored all eleven of
his points in the second half.

The ﬁrst half of the game was deﬁned by
subpar shooting, turnovers, and generally
sloppy play. Both teams did tremendous jobs
grabbing defensive rebounds, 12 for W&L and
14 for Randolph, but that was due to the in-
ability to put the ball in the hoop.

The Generals only made ﬁve baskets and
three from the line in the ﬁrst half, but they
beneﬁted from poor shooting from the Wild-
cats to keep the game close.

Despite the ﬁrst half struggles, Randolph
found their offense in the next half, as they
made shot after shot all over the court while
the Generals could not break out of their of-
fensive funk. _

Randolph was led by four players with
eleven points, starters Zach Desgain and

Colton Hunt and the aforementioned Ehilegbu
and Battaglia from the bench.

Starter Dylan Shiﬁett’s 11 rebounds were
the game high and teammate Hunt put up a
solid effort with eight rebounds and four as-
sists, which was also the game high.

On the Generals’ side, JD Ey and Larry
Whitaker were the night’s best players. Ey put
up nine points and nine rebounds along with
ﬁve blocks in a starting effort. Whitaker had
eight boards and seven points.

Starter Jeremy Adkins scored eight points,
including making two of three three-point at-
tempts. ’

W&L managed just two points off the
bench. They came from Devin Dillard in the
ﬁnal minute ofthe game.

The loss puts the Generals at an overall re-
cord of, 11 and 9, 4 and 7 in the ODAC. They

By Neil Haggerty
STAF F WRITER

After years of planning and meticu-
lous research, the Washington and Lee
Mock Convention predicted Saturday

‘that former Massachusetts Governor

Mitt Romney will run against Barack
Obama as the Republican candidate for
president.

Romney’s won the nomination with
1,781 delegates over Newt Gingrich,
Rick Santorum and Ron Paul after In-
diana gave all 46 of its delegate to the
former Massachusetts’ governor.

Not only did the 2012 Mock Conven-
tion have the ﬁrst—ever interactive web-
site with live streaming, this convention
also set the record for the most money
raised in the history of Mock Conven-
tions at W&L. The organization ‘col-
lected about $200,000 from over 650
donors.

At the start of the weekend, Mock
Con faculty advisor Professor William
Connelly said that this year’s convention
leaders were “poised to produce the best
Mock Convention in the history of Mock
Conventions at Washington and Lee.”

These leaders of the executive com-
mittee included the ﬁrst female general
chair in Mock Con’s history, Tricia King,
as well as political chair Zach Wilkes,
personnel chair Tucker Pribor, execu-
tive secretary Laura Ball and executive
treasurer Brandon Allred, as well as the
steering committee and state chairs.

These leaders helped to elevate the
convention to being the most accurate
convention in Mock Con’s history at
W&L.

King led the convention asking stu-

dents to be ready for the “phenomenon ’

and national storm that [Mock Con] is.”

“W&L is a school like no other...
[Mock Con] deﬁes the nation’s expecta-
tions ofyoung people,” said King.

On the day of Romney’s nomination,
keynote speaker and former Mississippi
Governor Haley Barbour said, “I can’t
wait until the afternoon is over, because
I know you are going to get it right.”

Romney’s ability to lead America out
of the major budget deﬁcit was a major
theme throughout the speeches during
the convention as well as the need for
Americans to come together behind a

Republican candidate.
Carville v. Coulter

Mock’ Con weekend kicked off with
a debate between popular right-wing
political commentator Ann Coulter and
successful liberal campaign coordina-
tor James Carville, who is the ﬁrst out
of party speaker in Mock Con’s history.
This debate was moderated by W&L
graduates Mike Allen ’86, the chief
White House correspondent for POLIT-
lCO, and Kelly Evans ’07, a W&L Busi-
ness Journalism major and reporter for
the Wall Street Journal.

During the debate, Coulter said Rom-
ney is the most electable candidate for
president in the Republican party “but
it’sjust hard to take out an incumbent.”

Along with Obama’s incumbency,
Coulter said, “He’s charming, he’s got
the mainstream media.”

Carville also said that he believes
that Romney is going to be the nominee
for president, but “Romney cannot beat
Obama...because Romney is just a bad
candidate.”

“Mitt Romney is a generic Republi-
can. He’s kind of a square....After four
years of [Obama] wrecking the country,
square is going to be very appealing,”
Coulter said.

On the other potential Republican
leaders, Carville said that he would love
to see Newt Gingrich win the nomina-
tion.

Coulter responded to this comment
saying that Gingrich’s candidacy would
be a 49-state landslide. However, she
said that New Jersey Governor Chris
Christie would be a very strong candi-
date and a good running mate for Rom-
ney.

“Chris Christie is a once in a lifetime
politician,” said Coulter.

The issue ofObamacare and the cov-
erage of contraception in insurance was
also discussed in the debate.

Carville said, “I am for women hav-
ing contraception at every junction.”

Coulter said, “This is madness that
insurance will have to cover contracep-
tion,” calling Obamacare “communism.”
W&L hearts Huckabee -

Following the debate between Car-

ville and Coulter, former Republican
primary candidate and Arkansas Gov.
Mike Huckabee opened the convention
saying, “The accuracy is reason enough
why any politician wants to be [at Mock
Con].” .
Huckabee said to students that “the
best government we will ever have...
is self-govemment” and that “lowering
taxes is an effect of self-govemment.”

Huckabee described self-government
as an aspect of the Republican party’s
platform that allows people to move up
in society on their own.

“I am the ﬁrst male in my entire fami-
ly lineage to graduate from high school,”
said Huckabee. He added that “unless
something drastically changes starting
with this election,” young people today
won’t live better lives than their parents.

“What a terrible kind of legacy,” said
Huckabee.

H uckabee said that the current gradu-
ated tax system of the Obama adminis-
tration will prevent the current genera-
tion from living better lives than their
parents because it “punishes people who
are trying to be productive.”

Huckabee said, “It is not the govem-
ment’s job to referee” and that the gov-
emment’s job is to make sure that the
winners are the ones who are responsible
and the losers are the ones who live reck-
lessly. '

Huckabee closed his address asking
students to elect someone that will chal-
lenge Americans. “I want your world to
be every bit as good, if not better, than
the one I have. . .It is our responsibility to
do unto others as we would have them do
unto us,” said Huckabee.

Session One

Mock Con began with two video
calls from Speaker of the House John
Boehner and Ohio Sen. Rob Portman,
followed by several politicians who em-
phasized the need to elect a Republican

"president to bring back constitutionality

to the federal government.

“Exercises such as the Mock Conven-
tion can provide people a special insight
on how we choose our leaders,” said
Boehner.

Portman added that conventions are

Mock Convention at W&L.

“one of the most exciting and important
traditions in ‘all of American Politics”

, and that it is “time for the government

to stop spending more than it can pay.”

Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell fol-
lowed Coulter as one of the many poli-
ticians who spoke during the weekend-
who supported Romney as the candidate
for the Republican party. McDonnell
said, “[Romney] is the right guy at the
right time for America”

According to McDonnell, Republi-
can governors like Romney have been
able to cut $65 billion in deﬁcits and that
they govern 7 out of l0 ofthe states with
the lowest unemployment rates.

McDonnell also pointed to the uncon-
stitutional healthcare system under the
Obama administration and failed entitle-
ment and environmental policies as as-
pects of the current federal government’s
work that Republicans can improve.

Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuc-
cinelli followed McDonnell’s speech
emphasizing that if the federal govern-
ment breaks the law, people need to push
back.

“The president seems to think that his
agencies will follow the law whenever
he likes the law. . .we are fulﬁlling the vi-
sion- about how federalism should work
in the real world” by pushing back, Cuc-
cinelli said. ‘

West Virginia district Congresswom-
an Shelley Moore Capito did not point
to a speciﬁc candidate that she supports
but said a strong conservative needs to
ﬁll the “vacuum of leadership” in Wash-
ington.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor
closed the ﬁrst session. He reflected on
the traditions of honor, mock political
conventions and national unity at W&L
as a model for the rest ofAmerica to fol-
low.

. Cantor said that the Mock Conven-
tion is an opportunity for students to
learn the Republican party’s platform.

“[Mock Con] reﬁects the traditions
here at W&L that support young leader
involvement...we are a party of ideas,”
said Cantor.

Cantor said the Republican party’s
system of freedom can bring back the

American Dream, in which generations
improve upon generations.

“As the president has co-opted how
we Republicans talk, he has not co-opted
how we Republicans walk,” said Cantor.

He added, “The President’s concept
of a fair shot and mine differ...if you
work hard and play by the rules, every-
one in America should have a fair shot.”

Cantor said that wealth distribution
is an aspect of Obama’s policy that does
not give everyone a fair shot. He said
that the poor should receive a “hand-up,
not a hand out.”

Session Two

Session two of the 2012 Mock Re-
publican Convention included speeches
by Michigan Congressmen Thaddeus
McCotter, former Republican Presiden-
tial primary candidate and Governor of
Utah Jon Huntsman Jr, and former Okla-
homa Congressman J.C. Watts. These
speeches emphasized the need for Amer-
icans to come together in the face of an
adverse economy.

‘‘I’m happy to be with young peo-
ple...[people] don’t necessarily respect
the fact that wisdom comes with no age,”
said McCotter.

McCotter added that in the current
times" in which we face, the Democratic
party failed to recognize the need for
self-govemment.

“Why would you let the federal gov-
ernment choose your doctor and tell
you what kind of healthcare you should
have?...This is why [the democrats] are
not progressive, they are regressive,”

"said McCotter.

He told students that they must ﬁght
against the current govemment regula-
tions. “You are wide awake and you will
make a difference,” said McCotter.

After a video call from l98O W&L
graduate Chris Burnham, in which stu-
dents were commended for their com-

. mitinent to service, Huntsman spoke to

students about focusing on America, not
partisan politics.

What’d you
think?

Students, alums and parents

sound oﬂ on the weekend

ByTommyKent
STAFF WRITER

First Session

Dick Warren ‘53: “Mock conventions are always won-
derful and terribly interesting due to the devoted ef-
forts over a long period of time by W&L students. The
speakers were marvelous. They were inspiring, includ-
ing some of the students.” »

Juhi Amin ‘I3: “I think [the speakers] were able to

_ represent a wide range of different viewpoints. They

make you think. It wouldn’t be exciting if they said
everything you wanted to hear. You want speakers who
will invoke thought. Even though they were all from
the same party it was interesting to see how they had
different views.”

Second Session A ‘
Mark Sowimski ‘I4: “I really enjoyed it. J.C. Watts
told some really moving stories.”

Tyler Grant ‘I2: “ I’m ﬁred up. I like what J.C. Watts
said: ‘We need an American campaign, not a Republi-
can campaign.’ I think the generalmessage is: We can’t
be divisive. We need to look at the bigger picture. The
speeches were really bold. I really liked the speeches.”
Lauran Lukas ‘I2: “I thought [the speakers] were very
enthusiastic. They had a lot of energy. A lot of repeated
themes: self-govemance. Self-govemance was the key
message. It was a good one. I really liked how Hunts-
man incorporated our motto.”

Liz Bell ‘12: “I loved [Thaddeus McCotter]. I thought
from his facial expressions, that we were just supposed
to laugh at everything. As a Democrat, I would say
leaving the convention, I’m a little more open to the
Republican party’s platform.

Mary Decembrino (mother of ‘I2 graduate): “I thought
it was great. I would say I ﬁnd J .C. Watts very inspir-
ing. John Huntsman had a lot of great things to say. I
could relate to a lot of the issues he was referring to. It
was engaging and informative.”

Third Session

Amanda Dixon ‘I5: “I think we had really impressive
speakers who had a lot of personal insight. Thompson
gave a lot of personal insight.”

Gordon Leggettl ‘54 (Board of Trustees Emeritus):
“My impression was that the speakers with the ex-
ception of Dick Morris, were awful, especially Fred
Thompson. I did enjoy McMaster. He was the second
best. Fred Thompson was just too long and just too
dry. It is a great tradition at W&L and this has been
one of the best I have ever attended. I came all the way
down from Philadelphia to hear this. I’m very curious
who they are going to nominate. One of the things that
puzzles me, is why there has been so little mention of
Gingrich or Santorum. Strong Republican platform
that has very little mention of Gingrich or Santorum
is surprising.”

Fourth Session
Clarke Morrison ‘12: “I think it was well done but pre-
dictable.”

Tommy Joe Bednar ‘I5: “I thought it was going to be
Romney all along. I was surprised by the margin we
gave him and the choice of vice president.”

Gary Franke, wrestling coach (attending his 10th
Mock Con): “I think they are always different, because
the student body always changes. It is always excit-
ing.”

Continued from “Mock Con...”
“What this evening is about is
your motto...not unmindful of the

duty and an obligation and a respon-
sibility to give back.”

tician’s goal of gaining the heart of
America and not to be political.

“it’s an intimidating deal when
you look somebody in the eye and
say ‘I want your vote,’” said Hunts-
man.

Although he talked about his po-
litical past, he said politicians and
citizens must remember what’s really
important.

“We must regain conﬁdence...I
am an American before I am a Re-
publican. We are Americans ﬁrst and
foremost.”

Watts’s speech, which closed the
night, echoed Huntsman’s point that
Americans need to be united.

“This is not your American, it’s
not my America, it’s our America,”
Watts said. “We are part of an Amer-
ican campaign, not a Republican
campaign.”

Session Three

The third session speakers includ-
ed Dick Morris. political commenta-
tor and former White House advisor
to Bill Clinton, South Carolina Attor-
ney General Henry McMaster. Vir-

future,” said Huntsman. “You have a ,

Huntsman, emphasized the poli-,

tor and actor Fred Thompson. These
speeches reiterated the necessity of a
Republican president at this time in
our country.

Dick Morris kicked of the ses-
sion three speeches, saying: “I used
to work for Bill Clinton. I know what
it takes to re-elect a president and
Obama doesn’t have it.”

Morris reflected on the need for
a true conservative president like
Ronald Reagan, because “[Obama]
inherited a disaster and created a ca-
tastrophe.”

“[Obama] borrowed so much
money that he tipped the entire world
into what is called debt implosion...
Obama literally declared war on.the
upper income tax payers,” said Mor-
ris.

Morris said that Romney is cur-
rently the candidate with the best
ability to beat Obama in November,
but that he needs to make people be-
lieve that he is a conservative. Mor-
ris added that both Rick Santorum

and Newt Gingrich would also beat’

Obama.

“My head is for Romney, my
heart is for Gingrich, and my gut is
for Santorum...Obama will be a bad
dream,” said Morris.

McMaster followed asking stu-
dents to push themselves, ask ques-
tions'and be proud of America, in
order to live in the light of some of
the greatest people in America like
W&L’s namesakes, George Washing-

ton and Robert E. Lee.

Following a video call from
W&L grad Congressman Joe Wilson,
Goodlatte continued the sentiment
that the debt caused by Obama needs
to be erased by a Republican Presi-
dent.

“The reality is that the Obama ad-
ministration has 4000 regulations...
[Republicans] are committing to en-
acting a meaningful tax reform” to
decrease the burden on taxpayers,
said Goodlatte.

Goodlatte said, “We need a bal-
anced budget and an amendment to
the U.S. Constitution.”

The amendment that Goodlatte is
supporting is one that does not accept
the federal government running tril-
lions of dollars in debt.

A convention like the Mock Con-

vention at W&L is a great opportu-
nity for students to learn about the
political process and realize a party
platform, according to Goodlatte.
I “You’ve spent months studying
how the process works...you have
the same feel [of a real convention],”
said Goodlatte.

While most of the speakers either
supported the W&L convention’s
nominee or did not choose a candi-
date, Thompson said that he support-
ed Newt Gingrich.

“The way we view these candi-
dates has to do with the way we view
our country. . .the fact that [Gingrich]
may not play well with others who

Session Four

Before the ﬁnal state roll call and
the announcement of Mitt Romney as
the Republican nominee for the 2012
election, keynote speaker and former
Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour ad-
dressed the crowd. '

“Nominate the right candidate for
our party who will be the next presi-
dent and who will change our poli-
cies,” said Barbour. “Who has got the
best chance to beat Obama?”

Barbour also said that the incum-
bent president is always the favorite
and that we are not looking for per-
fection in a Republican candidate.

“Even when you disagree with
him, your job is promoting what
unites us as Republicans,” said Bar-
bour

Following Barbour’s speech was
the state roll call. After Indiana gave
all 46 of its delegates to Romney, he
was announced as the nominee for
the Republican party and Virginia
Gov. Bob McDonnell was announced
as the nominee for Vice President.

Romney’s wife, Ann Romney, ac-
cepted the nomination via video call.

Said Romney: “We are truly ﬁght-
ing for the soul of America.”

opinions

 

tothe editor.

Dear Rachel,

Thank you for your letter.

As a regular reader of the Phi, you
have probably noticed that one of my
goals is to entertain. I frame my obser-
vations of W&L‘s campus, the Greek
system, weekend nights, and gender re-
lations in a humorous light because some
occurrences on our campus are so ridicu-
lous, they are funny (i.e., the “I kinda
saw her bra” reference).

I could not be more opposed to up-
perclassmen encouraging undcrclassmen
to objectify women. As disgusting as
the scenarios I describe may seem, they

happen. I believe it is most effective to
draw attention to these gender relation
and Greek system issues in an easy-t0-
read article rather than an easy-to-ignore
pamphlet, a threatening, accusatory let-
ter, or a vague statistic. Additionally, it
is important for girls to understand what
goes on behind fraternity doors—infor-
mation is power. The group that per-
forms “Sex Signals,” a show brought
to campus by SPEAK and One in Four,
uses the same technique to raise aware-
ness for sexual assault.

You took my “They have been
through a lot and deserve our respect,

but beware that they may be a bit big-
headed” quote out of context, and made
it seem as if I applaud boys for treating
women disrespectfully. This comment
was made in reference to the difﬁcul-
ties of pledgeship. Fraternity pledges
run the W&L social scene; whether plan-
ning and setting up parties, giving sober
rides, or cleaning up houses the fol-
lowing morning, they are constantly on
call. This is a lot for anyone to handle,
let alone an 18-year-old boy in his ﬁrst
year away from home. Imagine juggling
pledgeship with your course load and ex-
tracurricular activities. Sounds difﬁcult.

I do not think that it is unreasonable to
applaud their mental strength and perse-
verance.

Additionally, it is silly to pretend that
a two-hour cookie baking party will have
the same effect as a round-the-clock ser-
vitude stint with a group of peers. Soror-
ity bonding involves going to a comfort-
able house, talking to a couple of best
friends, and avoiding interactions with
girls you would rather not “bond” with.
Pledgeship, on the other hand, forces co-
operation and cohesion. It entails work-
ing with every member of your pledge
class, regardless of how well you get

along. It means putting older brothers’
priorities ahead of your own and sacriﬁc-
ing every ounce of free time. As a mem-
ber ofa sorority, I can assure you that the
level ofunity within fraternities is higher
come March than within any other group
on campus.

In conclusion, my articles are meant
to be funny, not offensive! I hope I have
cleared up any misunderstanding.

Sincerely.

Some of it probably isn’t healthy.”
(We’re talking about food from a soror-
ity retreat, correct?)

This does not only apply to me. In a
camp letter my sister wrote home at age
12, she asked my mom to send her some
items she had forgotten. At the end, she
added, “PS. I’ll take care of S&H charg-
es!” Would I have ever thought about re-
imbursing my parents for shipping and
handling charges in the sixth grade? She
remains very conscientious today.

You can also look at the way that peo-
ple spend their free time. My sister and
I spent our free time differently when

to the editor

On Friday afternoon, I decided not to
go to Session ()nc of Mock (‘on (a con-
troversial decision, I know!) in favor of
getting all my work done to attend the
other sessions. I was walking back to
my house when I received a text inform-

ing me that General Admission, one of
W&L‘s a cappella groups, had been in-
troduced at session one as being “W&L‘s
only co-ed a cappella group."

T is was soon followed by a flurry of
texts from others informing me of what
had happened, each with a different level
of annoyance. Why?

Because were the Washingtones.
W&L‘s other co-ed a cappella group.

We’re not that new; Washingtones
has been active on campus for ﬁve years.
We were founded by Neville Fogarty
(of Phi crossword fame), and have been
spending at least an hour a week singing
together ever since. We perform fairly
regularly at things like WLUR‘s Open
.»’lirirares. We‘ve been at Relay for Life
and the Parents‘ Weekend a cappella
concert. We’re an official organization
and we have a webpage on the Perform-
ing Arts section of W& US website.

we were growing up, which accounts
for the differences in our personalities
today. My sister realized that the Easter
Bunny and Santa Claus were nonsense
unacceptably early. She enjoyed tack-
ling very advanced puzzles and invent-
ing her own artistic hairstyles (ask her
about “the unicorn”). At age 12, she read
Reader ’s Digest cover-to-cover.

Rather than sitting in my room read-
ing about New York’s crime rate, I spent
my time teaching my dolls how to add
and subtract, sitting in the driver’s seat
of my mom’s parked car with a mug of
coffee pretending to wait in the carpool
line, and betting boys in the neighbor-
hood that I could school them in soccer.
On the rare occasions when I opened
Reader ’s Digest, I turned only to one
section: Jokes.

Today, these differences are clear

But apparently we don‘t exist — and
that attitude is starting to grate on the
20 members of the group who come to
practice and enjoy performing. Every
year is an uphill battle for us, because we
are rarely, if ever, invited to perform at
W&L events. Everything we do, we do
because a group member has taken ini-
tiative and tracked someone down to get
us on the roster.

Mock Con has really put this into per-
spcctive. There were four sessions and
four renditions ofthe national anthem to
be sting. Every a cappella group was in-

through conversations around the din-
ner table. While my sister is sharing her
views on world events and discussing her
interpretations of complex philosophi-
cal statements, I am mimicking people,
imagining ridiculous scenarios, and tell-
ing embarrassing stories (on the first day
of school, I tripped down an entire ﬂight
of stairs and almost fainted). The differ-
ences in our favorite childhood pastimes
mirror the differences in our personali-
ties and interests today.

Serial cheaters are further proof that
people don’t change. You know that
partner who cheats once, promises to
never do it again, and cheats again‘? My
high school lacrosse coach told us that
the same boy who cheated on her in high
school cheated on his wife years later.
Think about how many marriages would
be intact if people did not stay with part-

vited to sing except us.
Let me be absolutely clear when I say
that I have nothing against the other a

cappella groups. l‘m friends with a lot of

the people in them and I enjoy listening
to them sing. But I’m not going to lie — it
hurts to be told several times a year that
GA, JubiLee and SoCo were invited to
sing and we weren’t. It‘s frustrating that
no matter how hard we work or how of-
ten we send emails. we cannot achieve
some level of acceptance.

We don’t feel like we‘re asking for a
lot. We don‘t want sympathy. but we do

bell Burr advises that voters look at candidates ’ past actions when deciding who deserves their vote

ners who had been dishonest with them.

This idea may seem obvious, but
when you’re casting a vote this elec-
tion season, remember that people don’t
change. ,

Take the Newt Gingrich-Freddie
Mac scandal. Is it safe to trust Gingrich
with the presidency? Look at Joe Biden.
He has been caught plagiarizing in the
past—will he do'it again? I would not
be surprised if he began his next speech,

February got you down‘?!

...Cynthz'a Lam has the cure, several little—kn0wn holidays to get excited about

By Cynthia Lam
COPY EDITOR

Oh. It’s February. This dreary real-
ization immediately brings to mind gm-
eling midterm exams and chubby, half-

the holidays you might have overlooked
last month in the hazy blur of January:
,SquirreI Appreciation Day (21st) —

naked cupids. After the hype of the New G’ tready to go nuts! Show some love

Year, the rest of the season pales in com- ,

parison to the excitement of the holi
Instead, we are left with stale Superbowl
wings, barely-existent snow ﬂurries, and
stubborn leftover pounds as we lazily
drag ourselves through winter term.
Luckily, the Ring-tum Phi has found
the cure for these Winter Blues, with
our innovative ways to celebrate lesser-
known national holidays. Forget about
Valentine’s Day — these wild and wacky
festivities will ﬁll each day with thrills
and excitement! Here are just a few of

or your favorite furry friends by wear-
ing plastic buckteeth and fuzzy brown
clothing from head to tail. For a truly
authentic wildlife experience, scurry
up oak trees, nibble on acorn cookies,
ﬁght off chipmunks, and dig random
holes in the back trails of the Blue Ridge
Moutains to bury your precious nuts.
After one day as a squirrel, you’ll never
want to go back to being a stressed-out
human college student again.
Measure Your Feet Day (23rd) — Go
all out by measuring your feet length,

width, size, surface area, and volume.
For extra fun, measure your friends’ feet.
Better yet, stop random people heading
to class on the Colonnade and measure
their feet. Footsie competition, anyone?

Belly Laugh Day (24th) ~ Do you
get annoyed when people laugh obnox-
iously loud? Well, today is your chance
to laugh just as loud by showing off
your deepest, rowdiest belly laugh. That
means throwing your arms up in the air,
doubling over in laughter, and shak-
ing uncontrollably on the ground every
chance you get. But don’t stop here —
text LOL!!!, ROFL!!!, and LMAO!!! in
bold, size 36 font all day long to share
your belly laugh with everyone. Laugh-

ing out loud has never been more fun.
Bubble Wrap Appreciation Day
(25th) — Pop. Pop. Pop. We’re excited.
Are you? Line your dorm halls with
bubble wrap, and you’ll always be able
to tell when people come and go.
Thomas Crapper Day (27th) — As
the inventor of the toilet, Thomas Crap-
per is deﬁnitely one of our most under-
appreciated geniuses. Without him, life
would be pretty messy... but let’s not
even go there. To make it up, show Mr.
Crapper some love by singing “Happy
Birthday” to him every time you go to
the bathroom. , Thanks to him, we can
literally ﬁush our “troubles” away.
Insane Answering Machine Day

(30th) — Admit it. We’ve all been tricked
by those ridiculous messages. Well, to-
day it’s your turn to have some fun. Try
out these classic lines for a good laugh!

“Hey, this is WLUR, you’re on air.”

“Hello, this is the Rejection Hotline.
How can I help you?”

“Hi, I’m probably here, just avoiding
someone I don’t like. Leave a message,
and if I don’t call back, it’s you.”

Now that you’ve seen all the enticing
holidays you missed in January, keep an
eye out for the ones in February. Beans
(Dried and Fresh) Month, anyone?

Director relates prisoner’s tale

F ilm director Alexandra Sviridova spoke to students about the terrors of Gulag Labor Camps

By Anna DiBenedetto
STA F F wn we R

Renowned Russian ﬁlm director Al-
exandra Sviridova told Washington and
Lee students the story of a Gulag Labor
Camp prisoner who survived frigid win-
ters and cannibalistic fellow inmates.

In Leybum Library last Tuesday,

Sviridova recounted the experience of
Varlam Shalamov, a Russian writer who
was placed in the Gulag Labor Camp in
the Kolyma Region of Germany in 1937.
Kolyma is known for its six-month cold
winters with average temperatures of-10

degrees Fahrenheit. _

Shalamov’s wrote a book about his
time in the camp, Kolyma Tales. In it he
recalls how some prisoners were called
“pigs.” Pigs were veteran prisoners who
would befriend new prisoners by taking

them under his wing and looking out for
him. He would feed him extra pieces of
bread, and then in the winter, when there
food was scarce, the “pig” would kill the
less-experienced prisoner and feed on

his body.

Sviridova was born in Moscow in
1951 and has received numerous awards
for her work as a ﬁlmmaker and as an au-
thor. She was brought to campus on be-
half of the Russian area studies program.

Jeremy Lin, the new point guard extraordinaire for the New
York Knicks, has been the hottest topic in the NBA for the past
week. The “Linsanity” keeps growing with each game, as Lin not
only continues to put on stellar performances, but has also led the
Knicks to ﬁve straight victories—despite missing marquee players
Carmelo Anthony and Amar’e Stoudemire. The fact that Lin has

 
 

"LAD

 

There are two Jeremy Lins. There is Jeremy Lin the player.
And there is Jeremy Lin the phenomenon.

Their combined effects have instilled life in New York bas-
ketball and have clearly shown that the formula for the Knicks’
success should rely on a heavy dose of number 17, and not
their overpaid superstars, Carmelo Anthony and Amar’e Stou-
demire.

 

galvanized the team with these two stat-happy stars on the bench
has led some to believe that the Knicks may be better when Lin
is the focal point. However, while Anthony and Stoudemire do
need to adjust their playing style upon returning to the lineup, ana-
lysts should not get carried away. Lin will remain integral to the
Knicks’ success, but the team should still revolve around Carmelo
and Amar’e.

For those who missed it, Jeremy Lin emerged from obscurity

I iAlf€. the .Knicks better off with Jeremy Lin in
tth‘e;;-lineup, or Carmelo Anthony and Amar’e
  '~ 1  - Stoudemire?

‘Stephen: Andrew give you their two) cents.

Lin’s style of play is not overpowering. He doesn’t overwhelm
with a single skill. It doesn’t matter. Jeremy Lin, the player, is
exactly what this Knicks team needs to win.

Head coach Mike D’Antoni’s. up-tempo system relies on fast
breaks and pick-and-rolls. D’Antoni wants to force the defense
to run around, then exploit the split second when they are off
balance. D’Antoni’s system needs a point guard who is patient,

last week to lead a struggling Knicks’ team back to relevance.
Some may remember him from his days at Harvard or from his ”
brief stint with the Golden State Warriors, but most knew little about him until he recently cata-
pulted to Tebow-esque levels of fame and popularity (if you need proof, he’s already the first sug-
J gested search when you type “je” into Google). In addition to distributing the ball well, Lin has
shown an incredible scoring touch. After scoring 25 points against the Nets, he added 28 points
(and a blue-gatorade—tinged-tongue-out celebration) against the Jazz, and a whopping 38 points
against the Lakers. With each game, Lin convinces more fans that his rise is no fluke.
The Knicks have succeeded over the past ﬁve games due to Lin’s ability to fulﬁll his team’s
needs from the point guard position rather than his ability to replace Anthony and Stoudemire.
Knicks coach Mike D’Antoni prefers an up-tempo style that puts a premium on the point guard’s

play that utilizes his decision-making skills. Lin offers D’Antoni a point guard with the desired
poise and versatility to control games. This attribute, and not his scoring, has helped the Knicks
the most. Despite Lin’s impressive numbers, his performances should be kept in perspective.
Without detracting from his amazing run, Lin may not be able to maintain his scoring pace
against the Eastern Conference’s best teams. The Knicks will need an elite, crunch-time scorer
like Anthony to compete with the Miami Heats of the world, even if his shots translate into fewer
scoring opportimities for Lin. Lin has excelled against a few bottom—dwellers as well as several
good teams, but the Knicks need extra offensive ﬁrepower to beat the best.

Many think Anthony’sstyle of play will not ﬁt with Lin’s, but there’s reason to believe Lin’s
game will complement both Anthony’s and Stoudemire’s skill sets. Prior to his injury, Anthony
had been scoring loads of points, but inefficiently. He took lots of shots and slowed the Knicks’
pace by demanding the ball in half-court sets. In fairness to Carmelo, though, he had to assume
an unaccustomed role of point forward during the Knicks’ search for a competent point guard.
When he returns, Anthony will have to be content with having less of a creative role and allowing
the ball to be more oﬁen in Lin’s hands. In return, Lin’s ability to penetrate defenses should give
Anthony more open looks on kick-outs. Even more enticing is the prospect of Lin combinin
with Stoudemire on pick-and-rolls (Stoudemire’s favorite). During their time in Phoenix (wit
D’Antoni as their coach), Steve Nash and Amar’e ran pick-and-rolls to devastating effect. Lin
may not quite be at Nash’s level, but his style is similar and should keep Stoudemire happy with
a steady supply’ of alley-oops.

To succeed, then, the Knicks need Lin, Anthony, and Stoudemire to adjust their styles in order
to suit each other’s strengths. Although easier said than done, this collection of players can deﬁ-
nitely thrive together. Lin has starred during the latter two’s absence, but the Knicks will need all

, three to be in top form to contend for an NBA championship.

command of the game. While Lin is not a fast-break machine, he excels at the pick-and-roll, a .

who is a supreme ball handler, who is constantly looking for
the open man, and who can hit the open jumper when it is
there. _ . ' ‘

He had Steve Nash in Phoenix. He now has Jeremy Lin in New York.

Granted, the former is a seven-time all star, two-time MVP, and sureﬁre Hall of Famer,
and the latter has only started four NBA games. But the similarities are there. And the suc-
cess when the system works is there as well. ‘ -

Lin can score on his own. His drives to the hoop are whirling, spinning, works of art in
which he usually ﬂies-into the paint, absorbs contact and ﬁnishes with a ﬁnger roll layup.
He makes it look easy. i

But what makes Lin.so important to this revitalized Knicks team is his ability to distrib-
ute. Instead of crawling into a half court set, and waiting for Carmelo to break down his
defender one on one, the rest of the Knicks are involved. Tyson Chandler is on the receiving
end of a handful of alley oops from Lin each game. Iman Shumpert of all people is suddenly
a viable offensive option. Games are now a team effort for the Knicks. ‘

And the rest of the Knicks are excited. They seem to love to play with Lin because he gen-
uine_ly seems to enjoy himself on the court. Which leads us to Jeremy Lin, the phenomenon.

Lin is a walking Disney movie. He is an Asian-American from California and was lightly
recruited coming out of high school. He ended up at Harvard and went undrafted coming
out of college. He was picked up and cut by Houston and Golden State and was toiling in the
D-League before an injury to Chauncey Billups gave him a chance in New York.

Four games, four wins, and 109 points later (the most points scored in a player’s ﬁrst four
starts ever), Linsanity has gripped America.

He’s hard not to like. He plays with enthusiasm. He’s humble, soft-spoken, and deeply
religious. He scores. He passes. He wins.

So many people are rooting for him. And that includes the rest of the Knicks. The team
appears simultaneously energized and relaxed. They seem involved in every possessionnow,
instead of sleepwalking down the court and letting Carmelo and Amar’e force up shots.

Carmelo and Amar’e are supreme talents, but the Knicks are better off with Lin running
the show. Because the reality is, as cliché as it sounds, teams are better than individuals.

Jeremy Lin won’t lightup the scoreboard every night. He was outplayed by Ricky Rubio
when New York played Minnesota on Saturday night.

But the-Knicks are winning. And they are winning the right way with the right player on
the court. And that players last name is Lin, and not Anthony or Stoudemire.

the Old Dominion Athletic Conference cham-
pionships.

Two more records fell yesterday at the
Bucknell Winter Classic, the last meet before
the ODAC championships.

Sophomore Zander Tallman broke both the
200m record and the 400m record, en route to
placing ﬁrst among Division III competitors in

both events. Tallman also placed ﬁrst overall
in the 400. »

Tallman ran the 400m in a time of 49.06.
Not only was this a school record, but the time
places him among the Top 10 for all Divi-
sion 111 runners in the event this season. He
also holds the top ranking in the ODAC in the
event.

In the 200, Tallman ran a time of 22.31 to
place third overall. First-year Aaron J eong ran

a time of23.34 in the same event to place third
among Division III competitors.

Other notable performances include Matt
Gossett’s mile time of 4:25.67 _to place fourth
and Kane Thomas’ 800m time of 1:59.09 to
put him in the ODAC.

The Generals return to the track on Febru-
ary 24 when they compete for the ODAC title.

After two days of competition and three
broken school records, the women’s swim
team headed into the last day of the ODAC
swimming championships, leading with a
score of 658 points. Randolph-Macon was in
second with 489 points, and Sweet Briar was
in third with 244 points.

The ﬁrst day of the three-day meet was
highlighted with a new school record in the
400 medley relay. Seniors Jocelyn Cassada
and Dana Fredericks teamed up with sopho-

more Meredith Hardy and ﬁrst-year Caroline

 

Hamp to swim a time of3:59.44. The astound-
ing performance set a meet record.

The Generals also won the 200 free relay
and the 500m freestyle. The 200 free relay
team consisted of Cassada, Fredericks, Hardy,
and junior Izzy Brassﬁeld. Junior Delaney
Rolfe won the 500m free.

Two more records were broken on the sec-
ond day of competition as the girls surged for-
ward, smashing the 800 free relay and the 100
breast times.

The 800 free relay team consisted of Rolfe,

Speed read
for charity

By Cynthia Lam
5 TA F F w R IT E R

This week, First Book will host its annual Speed
Read Week from March 5-9 in Elrod Commons to raise
money to purchase books for Iow—income children in
the Rockbridge County area. The charity event will
feature an interactive reading challenge for students
and community members, in addition to raﬁ’le draw-
ings and George and Bob t-shirt sales.

According to First Book secretary David Thomas,
the purpose of the event and the organization itself is to
promote awareness about this pressing cause and raise
funds to buy books for local schools.

“The main goal... is twofold: To educate our cam-
pus on the situation of our community,” said ﬁrst-year
Thomas. “The schools are underfunded and the fami-
lies often too poor to purchase books needed to help
young kids get on the right start for reading; then, from
the money raised we will work with local schools to
ﬁnd out what types of books they are lacking and then
use the funds from our events to purchase books for
students to read and enjoy.”

During the challenge, each participant will be given
the opportunity to read a Dr. Seuss book as quickly as
possible in 15 seconds. Whoever is able to read the
most words within that time frame will win one of the
many generous prizes offered, which include Fancy
Dress tickets for the First Prize winner and gift certiﬁ-
cates to local eateries such as the Co-Op, Hillel House,
and Pure Eats for the Second and Third Prize winners.

”It’s crazy to think that for $3, a person could be
walking away with two tickets to FD (which, com-
bined, is worth its weight in gold), but First Book is
making it happen, all for literacy,” said First Book co-
chair sophomore Joni Deutsch.

Last year, Speed Read Week raised about $600,
and the rafﬂe in the fall eamed another $500 for the
charity. The highlight of the experience, according to
Deutsch, was the involvement and support shown by
the entire school community, as students, employees,
and sorority members helped contribute to the success
of the event.

The week also generated many memorable mo-
ments and funny stories.

“The funniest thing about Speed Read Week is lis-
tening to the people read Dr. Seuss at-a-super-high-
intensity-speed. As far as I know, no one has been able
to read the entire book in 15 seconds, so that title is still
up-for-grabs,” said Deutsch.

Thomas, whojoined the First Book team in the fall,
has high hopes for this year’s Speed Read Week.

“Students at W&L are really trying hard to burst the
bubble of our campus,” he said. “I know the schools
and families really appreciate the resources our events
are able to provide. I hope students will know that any
act of kindness, even if it‘s making yourself sound fun-
ny reading really quickly in 15 seconds, is worth the
world to a little kid wanting to grow up and have the
same opportunities we all have been afforded.”

According to Thomas, this is truly a win-win situa-
tion for everyone involved in the event.

“Inspirationally, everyone wins: kids get books, stu-
dents learn about our community, prizes will be won,
and Dr. Seuss will be read pretty quickly for all to see,”
he said. “I think this would be a great group activity for
fraternity pledges if you ask me!”

Geologist Dr. Jim Reynolds came to W&L to discuss climate

change.

Panel. discusses honor

Interfraternity Council coordinates discussion on honor on and off the hill

By Tommy Kent
5 TA F F w R IT E R

Freshman and sophomore frater-
nity members came out of the rain
and into Lee Chapel to listen to a
panel organized by the IFC to address
the topic of“A Community of Civil-
ity” last Wednesday. The panel was
moderated by Beau Dudley ’74 ‘79L
and included President Ken Ruscio
’76, Professor Holt Merchant ’6l,
Lacrosse Coach Gene McCabe, and
senior John Wells.

For about an hour, the panel an-
swered questions presented by Dud-
ley concerning the honor system off
the Hill and on the athletic ﬁeld, as
well as the legacy of Robert E. Lee.
The meeting concluded with the pre-
sentation of the award-winning capi-
tal campaign video titled “Echoes of
the Past, Voices of the Future”.

Senior Woodie Hillyard, President
of the IFC, was responsible for the
idea and helped to organize the panel.

“I felt there was a need to make
people realize the broader meaning of
the honor system,” he said. “The EC
can’t deal with every matter. I real-
ized that there is a bit ofa disconnect
on how people act on the Hill and off
the Hill. It's kind ofour hope that the
freshmen don’t fear the honor sys-
tem but feel proud to be students at
W&L.”

In the opening, Ruscio said,
“When we were thinking about this,
one of the panelists asked me, did
[the students]‘do something wrong?
The answer is no. Tonight is a night
that we want you to leave here with
a great sense of pride and a feeling
of obligation to make W&L a better

place. W&L is one of the few uni-
versities left in the country that is not
afraid to talk about values and tradi-
tions.”

Citing the University’s mission
statement, Ruscio said, “Here at
W&L we can pursue our education’s
mission in a climate of leaming....
The statement says everything that
we are trying to accomplish here.”

The mission statement reads:
Washington and Lee University pro-
vides a liberal arts education that
develops students’ capacity to think
freely, critically, and humanely and
to conduct themselves with honor.
integrity, and civility. Graduates will
be prepared for life-long learning,
personal achievement, responsible
leadership, service to others, and
engaged citizenship in a global and
diverse society.

Ruscio, stating the signiﬁcance of
two stories and what they say about
W&L, mentioned former Senator
John Warner, the second longest serv-
ing Senator in history of Virginia, and
Virginia House of Delegates member
Lacey Putney.

“When asked, how is it that two
individuals led a life to that end of
service, Warner said it was because
of W&L and the honor system,” he
said.

The second story concerned the
portraits of George Washington and
Robert E. Lee and the lives that they
led.

“No other colleges have that kind
of rich heritage of unselﬁsh duty to
others. You are now the custodians

of that. You are the ones who have to
fulﬁll these principles,” said Ruscio.

“I really think it was Lee’s charac-
ter that brought him [to W&L],” said
Merchant, discussing Lee’s legacy.
“Around 80 percent of Southern col-
leges did not reopen after the Civil
War. [Lee] made possible what we
are today.”

Concerning the honor system,
Merchant said, “[Lee] created an at-
mosphere. He created an expecta-
tion. He set the bar very, very high.”

John Wells, a former member of
the Executive Council, began by
mentioning the lack of codiﬁcation
in the White Book, stating, “That’s a
pretty incredible gift.”

.“It loses face value if we only
think about [honor] when we are tak-
ing a test,” he said.

Coach McCabe discussed the con-
cept ofbeing “your brother’s keeper.”

“What we are really talking about
I think is taking better care of our-
selves,” McCabe said. “The idea of
being your brother’s keeper essen-
tially means we are there for each
other. I wonder if that is something
that we can apply to everyone on
campus. You can apply the idea of
team chemistry to how we feel about
our community.”

When asked asked if dedication
to the honor system meant sacriﬁcing
fun, Wells replied, with an“absolutely
not.”

“I think the biggest beneﬁt of be-
ing in a fraternity is when people
are showing each other the most re-
spect,” he said. “ Hazing at a funda-

mental level is not being your broth-
er’s keeper.” ‘

Ruscio said that W&L deﬁes the
social science law, which states that
there is a tension between becoming
a member of a community and grow-
ing as an individual. Ruscio also
mentioned the two ways that behav-
ior can be inﬂuenced: following the
rules and regulations that someone
lays out for you or through develop-
ing a set of values that inﬂuence the
choices that you make.

In application to W&L’s honor
system, Ruscio said, “The stronger
the values, the weaker the rules. We
are trying to help you strengthen the
values.”

“It wasn’t because Lee was lazy.
He was in some ways a philosophical
man. He thought you should follow
values, not rules,” Ruscio said, when
discussing Lee’s concept of only one
rule. “When you see a lot of regula-
tions, that is a sign that the commu-
nity values are not as strong as they
should be.”

Ruscio also said that the universi-
ty is a “gift” and an “inheritance.” He
added that men “can beneﬁt from the
sacriﬁce of others, only if you realize
the obligation you have for those who
will come after you.”

Dudley added that attending W&L
is a “privilege.”

“You will become W&L. I can
only add that I hope this causes you
to pause and realize what a special
privilege it is to be in college here,”
Dudley said.

Prof. warns on Warming

Geologist Dr. Jim Reynolds discusses “Climate Change and the Return of the Ice Age ”

By Allie Weiss
5 TA F F w R I T E R

Geologist Dr. Jim Reynolds,
Ph.D., visited W&L to discuss the
potentially catastrophic effects of
global warming, last Monday.

Dr. Reynolds’s lecture, entitled
“Climate Change and the Return of
the Ice,” comes with a warning. He
begins his lecture by telling his listen-
ers that this would not be an upliﬁing
talk. In fact, after a lecture given not
too long ago, one woman approached
him to comment that he had just ru-
ined her vacation. Since our vacation
has just ended, he ﬁgures that we
won’t have the same problem, and so
he continues.

Dr. Reynolds ﬁrst informs his au-
dience that Earth has been experienc-
ing Ice Age cycles
for the past 3 mil-
- lion years. Ice Ages

are punctuated by
' interglacial periods,
one of which we are
in now.

Interglacial peri-
‘ ods, Reynolds says,
: are caused by seven
' central factors. The
' ﬁrst factor is the
 Milankovitch Cy-
pl cles. The Earth’s re-

" lationship with the
sun changes with
regards to the shape
of the orbit and the
tilt of the axis. This
affects the way heat
is distributed across
the planet, accord-
ing to Reynolds.

The second fac-
tor is the albedo, or
the reflectivity of
the Earth’s surface.
The Earth’s sur-
face, when covered
in snow, reﬂects all
the sunlight com-
ing in, thus making
for a colder envi-

 

ronment. This is a good thing when
you’re dealing with the Arctic Ocean,
which is covered in ice, because if
the climate gets too warm then the
ice caps begin to melt. However, if
the light that is reﬂected by the ice
gets trapped in the layer of green-
house gases in the atmosphere, then
the Earth starts to heat up. As a result,
the layer of ice over the Arctic Ocean
starts to melt, according to Reynolds.

Reynolds then says that atmo-
spheric concentration patterns are the
third factor. In other words: exactly
how heavily concentrated green-
house gases are in the atmosphere.
Even before cars and coal took a
shine to the pollution of our planet,
these gases were present. Since the
Industrial Revolution caught on in
the eighteenth century, that layer has
been growing steadily denser.

The fourth factor is the Coriolis
Effect, which means that because the
Earth is spinning, winds and water
will bend.

Reynolds’s ﬁfth factor is the sur-
face oceanic currents. Ocean water
ﬂows in a speciﬁc pattern. Most im-
portantly for his purposes, the North
Atlantic Current brings warm, salty
water to Northern Europe. That part
of Europe has a latitude equal to that
of the Hudson Bay, though the cli-
mate is much more moderate. The
warmth is due to the North Atlantic
Current, which delivers water fresh
from the tropics to the northern part
of the continent. In other words, the
current is Europe’s heat supply.

Plate Tectonics are the sixth fac-
tor. Reynolds points out that the way
Earth’s plates move determine the
world’s climate.

Finally, Reynolds said the seventh
factor is Thermohaline Circulation,
or deep-water currents. The main two
rules for this one are that salt water is
denser than fresh water and cold wa-
ter is denser than warm water. Ocean-
ic currents are like a really intricate,

long chain of dominoes, and the Arc-
tic Ocean is like the two year old that
comes along and kicks it into motion.
The Arctic Ocean basin is full ofcold,
salty water, and when the basin ﬁlls
up, that dense water spills out into the
Atlantic Ocean and sets the chain in
motion. From there, the cold water
sinks to the bottom of the Atlantic
Ocean and becomes North Atlantic
deep water. It then spreads into the
Paciﬁc and Indian oceans, and goes
on to coat most of the oceans of the
world. Then it rises up at the coast of
Antarctica and in the Arabian Sea and
in the Gulf ofAlaska, and is recycled
back into the Arctic Ocean, at which
point the cycle starts over again.

Overall, when the greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere are too con-
centrated, they prevent the sunlight
that is being reflected by the ice from
exiting the atmosphere. This causes
the climate to get too warm, and the
layer of ice over the Arctic Ocean to
melt. When that layer is gone, the
winds over the Arctic Ocean become
moist, and carry that moisture to the
northern halves of the continents
around the ocean, resulting in inas-
sive amounts of snow being dumped
onto North America and Eurasia.

According to Reynolds, the bad
news is that this snow melts and be-
comes fresh water, trickling back into
the Arctic Ocean in abundant supply.
To an ocean, which had previously
carried mostly salt water, this signiﬁ-
cant addition of fresh water is a big
deal. Because it is less dense than salt
water, this inﬂux causes the top half
of the Arctic Ocean basin to be made
up completely of fresh water. When
the time comes around for the basin’s
water to spill over and enter the At-
lantic Ocean, the only water leaving
the basin is fresh water.

This shakes things up for the oce-
anic currents, which were previously
set in motion by much denser water.
The North Atlantic Current, which

is made up of dense salt water, sinks
beneath this onslaught of fresh water.
And thus Europe’s heat supply is cut
off.

According to Reynolds, this is
all inthe works right now. To em-
phasize his point, he ﬂashes a slide
which reads that this scenario might
unfold in less than ﬁve years. He then
reveals that he wrote that prediction
three years ago.

Reynolds is by no means the ﬁrst
person to voice this idea. In fact, most
geologists do not believe that such
an event will take place within such
a short period of time. However, the
pattern presented by Reynolds pres-
ents a compelling argument concem-
ing the way in which a warm climate
could result in a cooling event.

This won’t be the ﬁrst time the
planet has experienced a cooling
event. Reynolds explains that 8,200
years ago, an abrupt but mild cooling
event occurred that lasted 100 years.
Back then, this happening might have
seemed unfortunate to the Earth’s in-
habitants. Today, such an event would
be catastrophic. Because our planet’s
population has grown so much since
that time, the shorter growing sea-
sons caused by such a climate change
would result in a huge increase in the
number of people who die from star-
vation each year, according to Reyn-
olds.

Starvation won’t be humanity’s
only problem if this scenario plays
out. Mass migration could also be an
issue. V

In an effort to end his lecture on a
more positive note, Reynolds allows_
that rate might be critical. Getting rid
of carbon-based ﬁiels might be the
difference between whether Ther-
mohaline Circulation stops or simply
slows down. “We are living in a very
delicate time,” Reynolds said, “And
the Arctic Ocean is key.”

ists in many of the assigned texts. These
include James Welch’s “Fool’s Crow”

   

By Fmncescawison

and Cormac McCarthy’s “All the Pretty
Horses,” which both use a postmodern
frame to depict relations between men
and women. These texts lament the loss
of traditionalism in modern society. As
the semester has progressed, I have be-
gun to think more and more about the
lack of mutual respect between males
and females at Washington and Lee. It
would be really easy to just blame the
males and write about the “frat boys”’
failure to value females. However, it is a
completely two-sided issue. As much as
males treat females badly, females allow
males to treat them badly. Blame should
not be attached to one of the sexes, rather
to postmodern society.

The influence of postmodernism on
American culture has completely low-
ered the criterion of female expectation
from males. Postmodernism champions
the ultra-independent who rejects tradi-
tional gender norms. The postmodern
movement has greatly inﬂuenced popu-

lar culture to the point where many of
the subliminal messages presented in the
media support a postmodern approach to
gender relations. Open up any magazine
or ﬂip to any channel on TV and you’ll
be bombarded with casual sex and chil-
dren born out of wedlock.

The inﬂuence of postmodernism on
gender relations has diminished females’
standards for males. For example, in our
parents’ generation, sex was.still on a
pedestal. Intercourse signiﬁed commit-
ment and emotional connection. These
days, it’s a big deal when Washington
and Lee students have sober sex. Not to
mention, sex is maybe not always ex-
pected, but an effort is often made during
the ﬁrst couple of hookups.

In many cases, girls concede to these
attempts and disillusionment ensues. Af-
ter sleeping with a boy, many girls form
an emotional attachment and are often
devastated when the postmodern college
boy does not reciprocate this sentiment.

Furthermore, I’ve noticed many girls
suffering from being used but desper-
ately trying to disregard this emotion be-

cause they’re convinced (by postmodern
society) that sex can and should be ca-

I have pre-gamed, it usually comes out
with me.

Now on Barbour #3 and not even
done with Sophomore year, I decided I
had to do something about it. That was
a few weeks ago. As of now, I have not
lost it for three weeks (I). Bit ofa record.
As I’m sure I’m not the only one who
occasionally has losing-things issues I
thought I would share how I managed it.

First, I put my name in my coat. This
might seem like a bit of a no-brainer.
Duh. But because of the number of un-
claimed and unnamed coats now sitting
in the Commons Info desk I think it is

The federal gov-

ing, though. In fact, he has made a promise

something often overlooked. You may
feel like a kid going to camp, writing
your name on every tag, but it serves its
purpose.

Second, when you arrive at a loca-
tion, DON’T put it with all the other
coats. This is a recipe for getting it lost or
“accidentally taken.” A bunch of girls all
rushing in at 1:45 to grab their coat from
a mountain of green can easily make a
mistake. (I know, I’ve accidentally taken
people’s before.) Instead, put it in a place
not so foreign that you won’t be able to
remember it yourself but somewhere
that is a bit removed from the others.
Say, inside the dryer at Windfall instead
of on top of it. And whatever you do,
don’t leave it anywhere at Pumptown. I
don’t know why, but the place just seems
to eat coats.

Third, if you do lose one you have
a few options. You can frantically text
everyone the next day hoping someone
grabbed it by accident. You can grab
someone else’s that looks just like yours

as you go out the door and hope you can
trade later. You can also, if you’re brave,
put a notice in the “Lost and Found” of
Campus Notices. Although the idea of
having the entire student body know ex-
actly where you were the past weekend
and what you lost may be embarrassing,
I have recovered at least one coat in this
way (thank you, Phi Delts).

So it is possible to successfully keep
up with and wear the same Barbour
coat for a lengthy period of time. This
is good, as I don’t think my parents will
be remotely willing to buy me any more.
Luckily, this shouldn’t even be an issue if
this gorgeous spring term weather keeps
up. So whoever is now wearing my old
lost jackets, I hope you’re enjoying
them. I certainly did. But if I ever ﬁnd
out who (accidentally) grabbed them and
didn’t turn them into Commons, you bet-
ter watch out. They are shooting jackets
after all.

Well, not yet. Vermin Supreme isjust one
of the hopeful candidates hoping to call the
White House home for the next four years.
A democrat, Mr. Supreme has» some historic
ideas of his own. Should he be elected presi-
dent, the ﬁrst thing he will do is pass a man-
datory “toothbrushing” law. In his words,
“Gingivitis has been eroding the gum line of
this great nation long enough, and must be
stopped. For too long, this country has been
suffering a great moral and oral decay, in
spirit, and incisors.” Supreme is quick to as-
sure voters, however, that this law is not only
about building a team of secret dental police,
nor is it merely for the purposes of creating
dental reeducation centers and govemment-
issued toothpaste “containing an addictive
yet harmless substance.” These would all
simply be stepping stones towards healthier
teeth and a stronger country.

And, really, what else can you expect
from a guy who wears a boot on his head?

Mr. Supreme’s ideas aren’t all threaten-

which no other candidate has made thus far:
free ponies for everyone. Supreme made an
appearance before the New Hampshire Insti-
tute of Politics advisory board on December
16, 2011. When board member Terry Shu-
maker asked about Supreme’s idea to give
a pony to every American, the reply was
calm and immediate. Supreme believes that
the most overlooked issue in America is that
citizens do not have access to free ponies. A
pony-based economy will lower America’s
dependence on foreign oil, as well as serve to

and we’ll have lots of zombies, and we’ll just
dangle brains in front of them and then they
will turn the giant turbines...” Zombie rights
activists have yet to comment on this latest
development.

Mr. Supreme is a self-described “friendly
fascist” and a “tyrant that you should trust.”
He is also arguably the most honest candi-
date in the running, as he openly admits that
“Yes, I am a politician. I will promise you
anything that your little electorate heart de-

program, which would necessitate owners to

Hampshire Union Leader, Beth LaMontagne
Hall, follows up on Shumaker’s question by
asking what other entitlement programs Mr.
Supreme is in favor of. “Just that one,” Su-
preme answers. “That’s enough.”

The last issue the candidate addresses has
to do with alternative energy sources. He

But he isn’t ﬁnished yet. As the song draws
to a close, Mr. Supreme kindly thanks his lis-
teners, and then jumps out of his chair and
begins to wildly ﬂing glitter upon Randall
Terry, who has been listening through his
grimace thus far, and shout that “Jesus told
me to make Randall Terry gay. He’s turning

against homosexuality, did not look amused.

weight and had a pierced nose. She was
wearing a black t-shirt that was too tight.
The man was tall and lean; his ﬂannel
plaid shirt and jeans were very faded.
For a second, I thought he was homeless.
The way he was talking to the woman
was uncomfortable to witness. To put it
bluntly, he sounded like he was trying to
get laid.

Here is a sound bite from the conver-
sation. '

Man: “How old are you?”

Woman: “4l”

Man: “And you have two college-
aged kids?!”

Woman: “Yes”

Woman: (laughs)

I unconsciously shook my head and
muttered, “Ew.” I ran into the odd couple
again when the man was saying that he
would buy chocolate only if“she would
have a piece. “ And that he “wanted to
buy it” even though he knew he “didn’t
have to.” ‘

I did not even want to let my mind
wander into what their plans were for the
afternoon.

3. Never take W&L for granted

If you have ever gone out at a different
school, you have probably realized that
the parties and students do not compare
to those at W&L. At some parties at oth-
er schools, the combination of couples

I)’

Break

lBurr shares observa l0}’lS from her travels

grinding to Top 20’s pop, boys walking
around trying very hard to look intoxi-
cated, and girls wearing slutty Hollister
tops may make you question whether
you are at a high school or college party.

Additionally, the people are not
nearly as “normal” as W&L students.
A friend at a prestigious university on
the East Coast said, “Everyone here is a
douche. And it’s not even like they are
cool and have the right to be.” He gave
me two examples. _

An English major in one ofhis classes
insists on talking in a whisper when she
is talking about class material. Riiiiight.

Another boy in ones of his classes
talks in a flamboyant, overly enthusias-
tic voice about “how much he enjoyed
the reading.”

My friend told me he missed “normal
people.” Yikes.

Before you complain about W&L,
ask your friends about their college ex-
periences and decide if you really have
something to complain about.

4. Never ask a sales associate for
help

Learned this one the hard way. I was
looking for a piece of clothing in a store,
not positive that I wanted to purchase it.
I asked an employee if she could help
find something that ﬁt me.

Not only did she point me in the right
direction, she also gathered about six
different options in my size and contin-
ued bringing me more to try on. It got to
the point where she was so invested in

looking for items for me, that I felt un-
comfortable because I knew I probably
would not buy anything. She was prob-
ably banking on a high commission.

I told her I was going to walk around
the store a bit and look around. She guid-
ed me out and continued returning to the
area where I was looking.

When I decided to leave without
purchasing anything, I felt guilty, even
though I had no reason to. When I
thought she wasn’t around, I attempted
to gracefully exit the store without her
noticing. The goal was to save myself
from seeing her face when she realized
she had wasted 20 minutes.

Unfortunately, I was wearing new
pants with a magnetic tag in the back.
Mid-exit, the beepers in the store went
off. Cover blown. '

5. Avoid running errands between
12 p.m. and 3 p.m.

I’m sure this lesson applies to other
W&L students who a) like to listen to
music in the car and b) have moms who
are huge Rush Limbaugh fans. Love the
guy to death, but hello, gotta make time
for my Kidz Bop! ‘

In conclusion, I know, pretty lame
that eavesdropping on a conversation
between two weirdos was the highlight
of my break. Maybe next time l’ll be al-
lowed to go to Mardi Gras! (This plea
to Mr. and Mrs. Burr is endorsed by the
Phi.)

totheeditor:

Dear Campbell,

Thank you for your response!
I appreciate your feedback and I
understand that, as a W&L wom-
an yourself, you would not inten-
tionally propagate gender divides
at W&L. _

However, I would like to clear
up some of my points in my letter‘
that you may have misunderstood.
I think it’s greatto tackle gender
issues on campus through a comi-
cal and fun light. It makes tough

problems more interesting and

easier to talk about. But there was
no indication your article’s goal

‘was to address gender problems

on campus. Due to this reason, I
wrote my letter to bring forth the
messages that your article did
send to the female readership.
Ultimately. my goal was to cre-
ate awareness about how we, as
W&L women, speak about men
and women on campus and the
underlying gender issues that re-
sult. No woman on campus would

want to propagate gender prob-
lems, but there are times when we
say things that could be express-
ing the wrong ideas. Perhaps a
clearer intent of your opinions
would reduce misunderstandings.

, Furthermore. I must continue
to disagree with your opinion
about fraternity men being able to
fonn stronger friendships through
pledgeship than the opportuni-
ties afforded to W&L women. I
know that this is a popular opin-
ion endorsed by many people, but
I must ask, what is the basis for
this belief? Are fraternity boys
who are fresh out of pledgeship
nicer to one another? Get in less
arguments? Are more “real” with
each other? There is not a uniform
standard to base this generaliza-
tion on. Instead, this comparison
is unfair on independent men and
W&L women (both Greek and in-
dependent). since it conveys the
message that they can‘t achieve as
close of friendships because they

are not part of a fraternity.

Moreover, when you say, “As
a member of a sorority. I can as-
sure you that the level of unity
within fraternities is higher come
March than within any other
group oncampus," you are dis-
counting sections of students who
are not in the Greek system. For
example. the members of histori-
cally African American sororities
and fraternities are extremely uni-
ﬁed. You just have to look at the
work they put into a probate —
it‘s absolutely amazing. And what
about students who choose to be
independent? They consciously
choose to not be a part ofthc dom-
inating social scene on campus,
which can lead to marginaliza-
tion. Going through this decision
together is often a huge unifying
force for non-Greek students.

As a student body. we should
do away with comparisons and
generalizations about pledges‘
relationships altogether. Men and

women, no matter who they are,
can form close relationships on
their own terms independently of
one another. So yes, pledgeship
brings together a lot of W&L men
to form very close friendships
through their mutual experiences.
But I‘d also like to mutually stress
that independent men and W&L
women also form great li'icnd-
ships through other means --
whether through sports, living on
the same hall. student organ za-
tions, Greek life. non-Greek life,
D-Hall conversations. and every-
thing else undcr the spectrum of
life here at W&L. The many op-
portunities for socialization. even
outside of the Greek system. are
huge contributing factors to why
Washington and Lee is such a
great place for student life.
Sincerely.
Rachel Urban

W&L students have fun performing an “over
the top ” play this weekend

, .+ uya ,

By Gabrielle Tremo
5 TA F F w R I T E R

Bright colors and harlequin costumes
brought Shakespeare’s Comedy ofErrors
to life on the Washington and Lee stage.
The famous playwright’s shortest work
follows the quest of Antipholus and his
servant as they bumble t.hrough marital
misfortunes, money trouble, wrongful
arrest, street brawls, punny insults, and
a Shakespearean exorcism, in search of
their long-lost twin brothers.

“The humor is very over the top,”
said junior Elizabeth Lamb, the stage
manager. “lt’s campy~ like l960’s Bat-
man. l’ve done very few comedies, this
isn’t the type of play I usually do or even
see, but the campiness and fun is great
to watch.”

Colorful lights that change with the
mood complement the sparkling se-
quined coats and dresses of the charac-
ters. In the style of Commedia dell’arte,
each actor wore a mask and experienced
the difficulty of performing with a frozen
face.

As alum Emma Patrick ‘ll playing
Aegeon, observed, “Commedia dell'arte
is wacky and zany and so it helps to have
the zany acting in a zany type of play.
The style is different, but the masks add
to the whimsicalness of the play and
make the coincidences that result from
the mistaken idehtities even more hilari-
ous.”

The masks often challenge the actors’

GWis Professor Shambaugh spoke Thursday about the Chinese governments rising power

By Colleen Moore
5 TA F F w R lT E R

Mostly every country in the world
assumes China will replace the United
States as the leading superpower — even
46% ofAmericans believe that to be our
future. According to the internationally
recognized authority on contemporary
Chinese affairs, Professor David Sham-
baugh, China is a “no longer a rising
power, but a risen power.”

Thursday night, Shambaugh ad-
dressed a full house in the North Audi-
torium about the conflicts surrounding
the new Chinese power. Applying his
expertise in China’s domestic politics,
foreign relations, military and security,
Shambaugh analyzed China as what he

A4

called the “engine of global growth.”

China has been broadening is global
cultural footprint over the decades. It has
had greater and greater impacts on world
affairs than ever before. Because of this,
experts are asking questions about the
ﬁiture behavior of the Chinese leaders.
What impact will they have on the Unit-
ed States? What will they do with their
increased power and inﬁ uence‘?

One way to answer these questions is
to understand how the world sees China.
Nearly every country believes China will
replace the United States as the world’s
leading superpower. Yet, there is global
ambivalence about China’s rise.

Shambaugh says. "We see China in a
conﬂicted way for conﬁicted reasons."
Chinese nationalism is a big element in
Chinese society and in developing their
future role in the world. This is notjust a
prideful and patriotic nationalism though
e it is an angry and aggrieved national-
ism seen in sports, diplomacy and litera-
ture. The most well-known example of
this type of anger involves the YouTube
clip of the basketball brawl between
China and the U.S in 20l l.

The Chinese government did not
discover the importance of image and
public diplomacy until recently. Th V
are now using all their “tensions and

resources in tiying to improve China’s
international image,” says Shambaugh.
Consequently, there has been an upsurge
in “soft power” that focuses less on mili-
taristic, political and economic domi-
nance and more on creating a loving and
respectable image in the media.

What makes the “soft power” hard to
obtain is the “multiple identities that are
simultaneously competing about what
kind of power China should be," said
Shambaugh. There is no single iden-
tity within China agreeing on how to
step into its superpower role or how to
present itself in the media, which is the
reason for the “schizophrenic behavior”

abilities. In one scene, Aegeon, about to
be condemned to death, needs to express
intense sorrow and worry. But when re-
united with his family, he needs to con-
vey great joy.

Sophomore Lauren Howry, play-
ing Luciana, said, “They told us about
the masks— we knew from the get go.
In auditions, we were given a mask and
we had to work with it, we had to give
it a character. It’s a lot more interesting
because you need to be out into the au-
dience with your emotions... you don’t
have an ‘expression’.”

The play itself was very well re-
ceived. Thursday through Sunday’s
shows quickly sold out and extra seats
had to be added to accommodate more
people. The audience included com-
munity members, faculty, and students
of all years. Even prospective students
on campus for the Johnson competition
ﬂocked to see the play on Sunday after
their arrival.

Audience laughter and applause pep-
pered the hour and a half long perfor-
mance as the student actors effectively
translated Shakespeare’s slapstick humor
to the stage. Joseph D. Martinez, a W&L
theater professor, directed the play.

The next act to grace the Lenfest
Center is the already sold-out Nordwest
Deutsche Philarmonic on March 6"‘.

dress houe

in China. Unfortunately for the United
States, the center of power in China re-
sides most heavily with the nativist iden-
tity, which goals reﬂect the interest of
China only.

Professor Shambaugh is currently
teaching Political Science and Inter-
national Affairs at George Washington
University. He is the Director of the Chi-
na Policy Program in the Elliott School
of International Affairs and the Non-
Resident Senior Fellow in the Foreign
Policy Studies Program at The Brook-
ings Institution.

Lousy E&H pitching helps Generals dominate

W&L defeats E&H 1 5-3 in the second game of a double-header

By Julia Lancaster
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and «Lee baseball
team (4-6, 1-1 ODAC) took advantage
of poor pitching in the chilly Sunday af-
ternoon conference game versus Emory
& Henry (3-7, 1-1) to outscore their op-
ponents 15-3 at Cap’n Dick Smith Field.

A 57-person crowd watched on as the

second game in the double—header ver-
sus the Wasps displayed both the Gener-
als’ stellar patience at the plate as well as
talented hitting. Emory & Henry was off
to a decent start, scoring two unearned
runs. However, their pitching deterio-
rated in the second inning as they hit

Generals’ batter Alston James and gave
away three other walks, allowing W&L
a 6-2 lead.

Washington and Lee scored at least
one run the following four innings, se-
curing the 15-3 lead by the bottom of the
sixth. They collected season-highs with

15 runs and 14 hits. In stark contrast, the

-Wasps were done scoring after a third

unearned run in the top of the fourth.
Emory & Henry junior pitcher Jes-
sup Lambert took the loss, lasting a
mere 1.2 innings, surrendering six runs
on two hits and four walks. Generals’

SPEAK Day embraces Green Dot  

Kathekon works with the Green Dot strategy by encouraging students to speak up against sexual assault

By Happy Carlock
STAF F wn ITE R

As students walk between classes on
March 15, they will make the conscious
effort to speak to one another and ex-
change friendly smiles. Although these
are already daily occurrences on cam-
pus, the Speaking Tradition will be ac-
tively celebrated this Thursday as a part
of SPEAK Day.

Washington and Lee’s student alum-
ni organization, Kathekon, organized
SPEAK Day as a way to uphold Rob-
ert E. Lee’s ideals of civility and honor,
manifested in the Speaking Tradition.
Beau Dudley, Executive Director of
Alumni Affairs, has helped Kathekon
promote this event over the years.

“The Alumni Affairs Ofﬁce started
this tradition some years ago, and we’ve
been in a partnership with Kathekon
since it started about ten years ago,”
Dudley said. “One day a year we have
identiﬁed as SPEAK Day, and the Kath-
ekon members act as on-campus am-
bassadors for the Speaking Tradition.
Historically, they have given a sticker to
recognize anybody who simply speaks
that day on campus as part of that pro-
gram.”

This year, Kathekon decided to in-
volve the Green Dot Strategy in SPEAK
Day as a way to create awareness about
its cause and about sexual abuse. Dudley
originally came up with the idea of inte-
grating the two organizations.

“We got the idea in a conversation
that I had with Jen Sayre, the head of the
Green Dot Strategy, who deals with is-
sues of sexual violence and awareness,”
Dudley said. “I went to a presentation
that she put on about Green Dot, and she
went around the room and asked every-
one to think of one or two ways that they
could help embrace the program.”

Christina Lawrence ‘I2 and Thomas
Meric ’l2, Co-chairs of Kathekon have
been involved in organizing this event
and advertising the integration of Green
Dot.

“This year, we decided" to integrate
Green Dot into SPEAK Day as a way to
bring together old traditions with current
issues on campus,” Lawrence said. “We
thought Green Dot would be a good out-
let for this, and rather than just focusing
on speaking on campus, we have added
an element of ‘speaking up’ so that it ap-

plies to the Green Dot program.”

As on-campus leaders, Kathekon
members will show their support of the
Green Dot Strategy by actively encour-
aging students to speak up.

“One of the core principles of Green
Dot is simply to speak and not remain
silent when you see or hear something
that is headed in the wrong direction,”
Dudley said. “SPEAK Day is basically
going to be a subtle yet powerful way to
do two things at once: Number one, we
will absolutely continue with the Speak-
ing Tradition, but also, while we’re at it,
by having a sticker that says ‘SPEAK’
that is green and, quite literally, a green
dot, we will be promoting the Green Dot
program.”

Assistant Director for Alumni En-
gagement, Jen Utterback, sponsors
Kathekon and helped with the planning

' of SPEAK Day and its involvement of

Green Dot.

“I am so happy Kathekon has cho-
sen to show support for Green Dot on
SPEAK Day,” Jen said. “They are a
wonderful group of students.”

Speaker connects mind

ByTommy Kent
smrr warren

John D. Dunne, an associate profes-
sor of religion from Emory University
and founder of the Center of Healthy
Minds at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison, came to Washington and Lee
to speak on the topic of “Contemplative
Science” last Thursday in Parrnly 307.
Contemplative Science, as explained
by Dunne, attempts to bring together a
scientiﬁc approach of study of the mind
with the ideas of Eastern religion, specif-
ically those concerning Buddhist medi-
tation.

“Understanding the nature of the
mind comes from many perspectives.
Those different perspectives give us
different roots into the mind and cogni-
tion,” said Dunne. Throughout the lee-
ture, Dunne elaborated on the Buddhist
concepts of mindfulness and reiﬁcation
in the context of scientiﬁc study. Ac-
cording to Dunne, mindfulness empha-
sizes paying attention in the moment in a
particular way while reiﬁcation refers to

' a presentation of conceptual content as

salient and real. V

Advanced Tibetan monks, some of
whom have meditated for 30,000 hours
in their lifetime, self-induce high-am-
plitude synchronized gamma waves in
their left pre-frontal cortex when they
meditate. Dunne said that when the sci-
entists who were testing the monks saw
the data, “they literally almost fell out of
their chairs, the signal seemed so high.”

Dunne, who emphasized that he is
not a scientist but a member of an inter-
disciplinary team, said there is currently
a lack of an operationalized method to
study contemplative science while there
is also a lack of understanding of medita-

tion in general. “Clearly it has generated
a lot of excitement, but there is a little bit
of the emperor without its clothes, a bril-
liant vessel that is hollow on the inside.
The problem is we have no idea what it
means,” said Dunne.

The method that Dunne advocates
is that of neurophenomenology. This
method would align ﬁrst-person reports,
highly reﬁned phenomenological data
gathered from the meditators themselves,
with third—person analysis of data, scien-
tiﬁc tracking of gamma signals through
electroencephalography. When these
studies have been performed, a high
correlation of .69 is shown between the
verbal reports of the meditator with the
gamma wave data.

In the lecture, Dunne said he wants
to represent all of the different styles of
mindfulness which “has no univocality
in religion.” The primary dimensions
of mindﬁilness include object selec-
tion, meta-awareness, which refers to a
simultaneous awareness of the cognitive
background and the sensory foreground,
and reiﬁcation. The secondary dimen-
sions include effect, aperture, and clar-
ity/intensity.

According to Dunne, the study of
mindfulness and meditation can be ap-
plied in varied ways to improve the
health of minds. Mindfulness can be
applied to human perception, interpreta-
tion, intention, and action, with the effect
of reversing our own distortions on real-
ity. For example, a clinically depressed
person may view another person’s look
as an affront. In actuality, this view is a
faulty interpretation of experience. Us-
ing mindfulness, our own interpretations

can become more accurate, our actions
will cease to be dysfunctional, and our
minds will become healthier,

Dunne mentioned how color itself is
a product of our own perception. Dunne
said, “Color is not a thing in the world, it
is a phenomenon, an entity that occurs in
experience. Stuff is not blue; it is pho-
tons of a certain wavelength that causes
us to see blue.”

Through sensory experience, we con-
vert the non—conceptual into conceptual
schemes in our mind, ﬁtting things into
general “universals”. Dunne said the
capacity to use concepts is even pres-
ent in pigeons, demonstrating that such
concepts are not high-level. Using the
act of exclusion, we differentiate the
non—conceptual in the construction of
concepts, recognizing sameness. Dunne
also mentioned two additional features
of this process: the idea of approach
and avoidance as the framework for all
concept formation, and the identiﬁcation
or fusing of the image with the object is
supposed to represent, referred to as im-
putation or “making one”.

Dunne said, “Conceptual cognitions
need to seem real to us.” Dunne said
our ability to “skipthrough the repre-
sentation to the object itself” could be
evolutionarily beneﬁcial as it enables us
to quickly make inferences on the sense
data around us. If the philosopher mouse
paused to consider the misinterpretation
of the lion’s roar as being the lion itself,
he would already have been eaten. It is
only because the mouse can recognize
a roaring sound as a representation of a
lion, that the mouse can be saved.

Dunne said, “Our capacity for rep-

and Alumni Affairs directors, many
alumni have also inﬂuenced the celebra-
tion of SPEAK Day because of their
dedication to the Speaking Tradition that
has extended past their days at W&L.

“They are the ones asking us, once
they graduate, ‘How is the Speaking Tra-
dition? I’ve heard it’s dying. What do you
think?’” Dudley said. “They care a great
deal about it, and that’s one reason why
we’re so happy to promote a program
like SPEAK Day because, although it is
cultural and it’s been around for a long
time, with the advent of cell phones and
people being busy and marching from
class to class, we think it is smart to do a
few things to raise the proﬁle and remind
people that we speak to each other here.”

On Thursday, students can get in-
volved simply by acknowledging one
another on campus, while Kathekon
members will hand out green stickers
that say, “I Spoke.”

“SPEAK Day does not require much
from students but for them to continue
to spread the Speaking Tradition and be
honorable members of the community
by speaking up when they ﬁnd it neces-

sary,” Lawrence said.

SPEAK Day also coincides with the
Kathekon application process, which is
taking place from now until March 23.

“We would certainly be glad to get
applications from any rising juniors or
seniors who think they want to take a
more active role in SPEAK Day and oth-
erwise,” Beau said.

Above all else, SPEAK Day is essen-
tially a reminder of respect that serves as
a founding ideal of Washington and Lee
and is constantly upheld bye the com-
munity. _

“I’m anxious to tell you more from
the heart that the best description I have
heard of the Speaking Tradition came
from a senior professor not long ago,
and he described it as the ﬁrst step on
the road towards respect,” Dudley said.
“No matter who you are, what you look
like, where you came from, how old you
are, or anything else, if we are being civil
and speaking to each other, we’ve taken
the ﬁrst step towards a welcoming place.
That rings true with all of our alumni,
and I hope with today’s students.”

and meditation

resenting the world conceptually has
developed so much that we can project
ourselves far and beyond.” We pay at-
tention to anomalies in our environment
by attaching salience, produced in terms
of approach and avoidance.

An experiment directing individu-
als to push a button to send away im-
ages of delicious food framed in red and
to push a button to bring closer images
of delicious food framed in green was
performed. At ﬁrst, the difference in
reaction time was great, as the partici-
pants hesitated to send away the image
and quickly reacted to bring the image
closer. Dunne said that this difference
was drastically reduced when the par-
ticipants were simply told to “remember
that what you are seeing are pictures and
not food,” demonstrating how they had
set-aside their “effectively charged sa-
lience”.

Dunne mentioned how eliminating
this attached salience could help to make
minds healthier. The process of de-rei-
ﬁcation, the capacity to drop one line of
thought in favor of another and remove
the salience, “is an innate human capac-
ity that can be trained further.” Dunne
said that the approach/avoidance frame-
work could be reconﬁgured through
compassion. Dunne asked the question:
“Can the ‘story’ be retold?” '

When the discussion opened up to
questions form the audience, Dunne
was asked by visiting philosopher Andy
Clark whether or not “we are dealing
with two levels of experience.” Clark
asked, “Would you story change dramat-
ically if that two level was available?”

Dunne mentioned other practices tar-

geting reversal of the distortion of per-
ception. Dunne said the processing of
the philosopher mouse locating himself
in spatial/temporal terms is a false claim
and thus distortion. Dunne said that
stories about the self, the future and the
sense of agency are illusions and he then
began to discuss mind-wandering and
the moment of de-realization upon snap-
ping out of a daydream. Dunne added
that mediation could be furthered to the
extent that practices could be designed to
enable one to see through the illusion of
subjectivity.

Dunne’s responses to questioning
got to such a point that he said, “I can
see I’m losing you. I’m losing myself
already.”

More of an explanation into the role
and origin of contemplative science can
be seen by the work of Dr. Francisco
Varela, a prominent Chilean neuroscien-
tist, who, according to mindandlife.org
helped to create “the unique form of in-
depth dialogue between Buddhism and
science that has grown into the Mind &
Life Institute.” The Dalai Lama and also
Dunne have attended the Mind and Life
Institute biennial conferences, which ex-
plore various questions concerning the
mind and new areas of research.

Dunne is currently working with oth-
ers to prepare an article on the neurosci-
ence °of mindfulness, which will attempt
to elaborate on the neurophenomenolog-
ical approach. Dunne said, “Part of the
reason we are trying to write the article is
to settle on one term. Is there an experi-
mental program?”

Peer tutors offer aid in writing centers

By Drew Carlos
STAFF warren

Help in writing is readily available to
Washington and Lee students. '

The Writing Center, located in Ley-
bum, gives students the ability to talk
with a student tutor about their papers.

The center does not edit work. In-
stead it helps students to, as the Center
website states, “recognize and correct
their own errors.”

Professor Kary Smout said that the
main goal is to “help the students gain
conﬁdence, write better papers, and get
higher grades.”

Students can either sign up to work
with a tutor on the website or simply
show up.

The tutors, two or three per night, are
junior and senior writers from a wide
variety of majors that “love to help [stu-
dents] succeed,” Smout said.

Even though the Center currently
stays busy, according to Smout, he
would love to see more students utilizing
it. “We have an amazing satisfaction rate
among students who have come,” Smout
said.

The Williams School Communica-
tion Center is another place where stu-
dents can ﬁnd the help they need.

“I like the Williams School Commu-
nication Center because every time I go
my writing improves,” said sophomore
Victoria Bell. “In each session, we re-
view the structure of my paper and talk
about ways to make it better.”

Bell also pointed out that this center
is a great place to utilize if a student is
struggling in a class.

However, WSCC is only available for

students working for a Williams School
course, whereas the Writing Center is
available to all students.

WSCC, as stated on the frequently
asked questions section of their website,
is helpﬁil because, “The consultants can
help you to say what you have to say as
well as you can, show you strategies for
better revising and self-editing, and re-
fer you to appropriate sources for help
on matters that aren’t solved during the
appointment.”

Bell said that the best part of the ses-

sion for her is reading the paper “aloud
with the staff.”
Like the Writing Center, WSCC will

‘not proofread papers.

“It’s deﬁnitely an on-campus aca-
demic asset...that more people should
know about and use!” said Bell.

The Writing Center is open Sunday
through Thursday nights from 8 to 10.

The Williams School Communica-
tion Center is open Monday, Tuesday
and Thursday nights from 6-10 in Hunt-
ley Hall 118.

Columnist Yates Wilburn describes a conﬂict of economics, politics, and interests

The rapid
economic
growth ex-

perienced by
the economies
of East Asia
(particularly

China, South
Korea, and Ja-
pan) has cre-
ated a need for
energy that is
greater than
ever before. In
a region where
uncontested

hydrocarbons are more difficult to come
by than in most, these three economic
powerhouses must search abroad and in
diplomatically gray areas close to home
(most notably the South China Sea) to
compete for hydrocarbon resources us-

resulting dynamic has created a poten-
tially dangerous political and economic
situation as the governments of these
nations look to hostile and/or less-than-
reputable sources for the energy they so
desperately need, placing their various
economic and diplomatic interests (most
notably those with the US and Europe) at
odds with their energy interests.

All three nations have placed a large
amount of their hopes and faith regard-
ing energy in questionable players and
regions (again, the South China Sea) in
the international arena, with Japan im-
porting 9% of its oil from Iran, and South
Korea importing 7% from the same, as
well as a signiﬁcant amount from Ven-
ezuela, both regular international an-
tagonists.

China, steadily moving to pass the
United States as the world’s lead im-
porter of oil and natural gas since 1993,

After all of that hard work, the gang is

His campaign has made Hank a You-

on the American dream of unlimited op-

though, his good name has been dragged
through the mud by catty opponents.

A smear campaign has been launched,
claiming that Hank has never released
his birth certiﬁcate or his tax returns, and
has furthermore never responded to the
claim that he is a long—time user of cat-

es. The fact is that what once was a sim-

has not left his wallet yet.

least being that it can be used as a tool
for some high-minded moralistic pur-
pose and as a regulation. At base though,
a tax as the founders long ago and many
Americans still today understand it is
as the basic responsibility that every
American has to keep the government
that secures our freedoms and provides
us with safety operating smoothly. As
W&L alum and 1924 Presidential candi-
date John W. Davis said, “Taxation can
justly be levied for no purpose other than
to provide revenue for the support of the
government. To tax one person, class or
section to provide revenue for the ben-
eﬁt of another is none the less robbery
because done under the form of law and
called taxation.” Status check folks, for
all the money we spend in taxes, the gov-
ernment can barely stay solvent much
less concentrate on protecting our liber-
ties. For all the money we spend in taxes,

our liberties and government, is free has
now become a legally sanctioned form
of redistributive theft, and all that began
with the Constitutional Amendment for
income tax. '

From that point on, it seems that the
public sector needed no justiﬁcation to
take money from its citizens. That is a
pretty dangerous notion anywhere, in a
person or a government.

To be fair, we can all acknowledge
that there are those among us in this
country that are in need, but in systems of
redistribution, alleviating ﬁnancial need
in one place only creates need someplace
else in a land where all are supposed to
be equal before the law. Indeed, it is a
system that forces dependence little by
little in a land where independence was
once valued. It is a system that can so
vastly distort someone’s work schedule
to remain in a favorable bracket in a land

where “Protestant work ethic” is some-
thing everyone shared in regardless of
religion. Here I can hear the reader on
the Left cry out in shock, terror, and in-
dignation, that no one should be trying to
dodge taxes, that we should all be pay-
ing our oft—cited “fair share.” But my re-
sponse is simple. Where does anyone get
off deciding what exactly someone’s fair
share is? Queen Elizabeth I remarked
that it is unﬁtting and impossible to cut
windows into men’s souls. Is it any dif-
ferent to cut into men’s pocketbooks? To
quote Abraham Lincoln in a way he usu-
ally isn’t, “You cannot help the poor by
destroying the rich. You cannot strength-
en the weak by weakening the strong.

You cannot brifig about prosperity by

discouraging thrift. You cannot lift the
wage earner up by pulling the wage pay-
er down. You cannot further the broth-
erhood of man by inciting class hatred.
You cannot build character and courage
by taking people’s initiative and inde-
pendence. You cannot help people per-
manently by doing for them, what they
could and should do for themselves.”
Ultimately the construction of the
income tax system is flawed, and it is
completely impossible to ﬁx. It is based
on a completely un—American premise
that has altered the mindset of American
individuals. Come April 15, the free citi-
zens of this country become the hunted,

tates tax system and encourages classmates to do the same

frantically scurrying to ﬁnish the paper-
work and smearing lamb’s blood on the
doorpost before the IRS Angel of Death
spirits away their ﬁrst-bom in the night.
Rule by fear is not the American way;
it’s what built Lenin’s unholy kingdom
brick by brick. The Left can justify itas
a good cause all they want, but this has to
be the only charity I know of that accom-
plishes its goals with threats, because the
ones that do go out of business. be-
fore Obama will ever convince me other-
wise, he’s going to have to lose his hard
earned distinction as the President who
hosts $35,000 per plate fundraising din-
ners while Rome bums. He has hosted
I91 fundraisers already, more than any
other President. Personally I’d like to
know what he thinks is his fair share, be-
cause it seems the “change” he promised
has not left his wallet yet.

The stakes are high on this issue and
on several others, and the important
thing is that regardless of party, we are
involved in discourse. Think about what
America means to you, and honestly ‘ask
yourself if that idea is being acted out.
Even more important, we must vote. If
you don’t, than you have no one to blame
but yourself.

Snowmen and sunshine were just a

4.0 GPAs and top SAT scores, in addi-
tion to impressive resumes and extracur-
ricular activities. The group of ﬁnalists
were comprised of class valedictorians,
all-star athletes, student body presidents,
award-winning musicians, published au-

thors and talented researchers.

Over the course of their visit, the
students had interviews with faculty
members, current Johnson Scholars and
admissions officers to compete for the
generous full-ride merit scholarship. At
the same time, they were given the op-
portunity to experience dorm life, attend
classes, talk to professors and meet cur-
rent students. Each ﬁnalist was paired
with a ﬁrst-year or sophomore host, who
facilitated the stay by offering a ﬁrst-
hand glimpse of W&L.

Said ﬁrst-year Lisa Stoiser: “I signed
up to host a Johnson for two reasons:
number one, my ﬁrst W&L experience
was hosted by... the perfect host: hos-
pitable, helpful, not-too-motherly. [She]
let me learn what W&L meant ﬁrst-hand;

perience to a new prospee. Number two,
recruitment is fun baby! I love meeting
new people and seeing fresh faces.”

First-year Austin Pierce said, “I want-
ed to host a Johnson so that I could of-
fer them a good first impression of W&L
and to aid the Johnson program, which
has given me so much liberty. It deﬁnite-
ly fulﬁlled my expectations... I felt ex-
hilarated to have such an amazing group
of kids on campus, and they constantly
impressed me.” '

In addition to the regularly scheduled
activities, many hosts took this chance to
really get to know their prospective stu-
dents through insightful conversations
about college life.

“The highlight of the experience had
to be the chats that [we] had after we
came home from Old House,” said Stois-

er. “After a day of experiencing both the
classroom and social scene, the Johnsons
had a lot ofquestions about what it really
meant to be a part of this campus... The
honest discussions that took place about
the pros and cons of W&L really made
me appreciate my place here.”

For many of the ﬁnalists, this was
their ﬁrst time visiting and staying on
campus, which was an eye-opening ex-
perience. “My favorite part of W&L was
the active thinking that seemed to go
on in every classroom and every social
group... [but] I was surprised that Lex-
ington had so much partying going on!”
commented Paul Crookston, a ﬁnalist
from Tampa, FL.

Said Dani Rosenthal, a ﬁnalist from
Berkeley Heights, NJ: “I come from up
north, near New York City, where you

cannot leave anything" in public and
strangers are entirely indifferent to you.
At W&L people couldn’t be more polite,
helpful or honest. I had at least 6 people
who stopped and helped me around cam-
pus when I was hopelessly lost, and ev-
eryone said good morning and held open
doors for each other. The environment
was beyond what I hoped for!”

Several students also noted the won-
derful surprise of the snow storm. Noted
Eli Kresta, a ﬁnalist from El Campo, TX:
“The highlight of the trip was waking up
to snow on Monday and getting to make
snowmen and run around the campus. I
love how everyone walks around with a
smile on their face and seems genuinely
happy to be here.”

Generals split doubleheader

Baseball loses a heartbreaker in the niglztcap

By Leigh Dannhauser
SPORTS EDITOR

Washington and Lee (5-8, 2-1 in the ODAC)
won the ﬁrst game 8-3 and then lost to fellow
Old Dominion Athletic Conference team Roa-
noke (8-8, 1-1 ODAC) in the nightcap, 8-7.

In the ﬁrst game, the Generals outhit the
Maroons 13-4 en route to victory. First-year
third baseman Nick Biumi led the Generals at
the plate going 3-3 with a walk.

Junior Ian Shaw got the win for the Gen-
erals, allowing 3 hits and 2 earned runs in 7
innings.

The Generals took the lead for good in a
3-run sixth inning. With two men on and one
out, junior Alex Mait singled up the middle.
Junior Will Salley and Biumi scored on the
play. Mait scored one batter later when sopho-
more Josh Josephson, batting as the designated
hitter, sent a double to center ﬁeld.

The Maroons scored one in the bottom of

the sixth in an attempt to respond, but did not
score again for the remainder of the game.

The Generals had the lead early on in the
nightcap. They scored two in the ﬁrst inning
when Josephson doubled to right center.

The Maroons fought back by putting runs
up on the board in both the second and third
inning. They took the lead in the third in-
ning when senior Matt Wallman hit a two-run
homerun over the left ﬁeld fence.

The Generals responded with a 4-run fourth
inning. Junior Chris Nault hit an RBI single to
center ﬁeld and then scored when junior Jona-
than Stutts tripled. Junior Luke Dreary also
scored on the play. Stutts went on to score on a
single by Biumi.

The men’s lacrosse team lost to Franklin
and Marshall on Saturday 12-1] on the neutral
ﬁeld at St. Paul’s School in Brooklandville,
Maryland.

The game was tightly contested from the
beginning. In the ﬁrst quarter alone the game
was tied at three separate scores. The game
was also tied entering the ﬁnal quarter of play.

Washington and Lee struck ﬁrst on an un-
assisted goal by ﬁrst-year Garrett Paglia with

11:21 remaining in the ﬁrst quarter. Sopho- .

more Andrew Setian of Franklin and Marshall
responded just seven seconds later with an
unassisted goal of his own. The scoring went
back and forth for the next few minutes until
F&M went on a three goal streak to lead 5-3 at

the end of the ﬁrst quarter.

F&M fourth goal in a row was scored by
sophomore Sean Kenny. The Generals were
able to respond by scoring two back-to-back
goals to ﬁnish up the half. The Generals en-
tered halftime down 6-5. ,

The Diplomats struck ﬁrst coming out of
the half on a goal off of sophomore Tristan
Miller. The Generals came back to score four
goals in a row to take their ﬁrst lead since the
ﬁrst quarter. After two more goals for the Dip-
lomats, the score was tied entering the ﬁnal
quarter of the game.

W&L was able to score two more times
in the fourth quarter but F&M was able to re-
spond again. Junior Kevin Kilpatrick scored

—In the bottom of the ninth, the Maroons
were able to load the bases and score a run on
a single by sophomore Jacob Clifton.

Senior Jody Davis came in to replace
sophomore Mike Palicz on the mound. He got
the next batter to groundout, but a run scored
and the runners advanced. After intentionally
walking junior Caylen Blaire to load the bases,
the Maroons scored on back-to-back singles to
win the game.

Palicz picked up the loss for putting the
eventual scoring run on base. He allowed four
runs on two hits without recording an out.

The Generals will play this week on Tues-
day and Wednesday as they face Stevenson
and Mary Washington respectively. They also
have a double-header versus Guilford on Sat-
urday. Each of these games is home.

the winning goal for F&M with 2:27 left to
play. Junior Mac Means got off the only Gen-
erals’ shot in the ﬁnal ﬁve minutes of play but
it went wide.

Shot differential was one of the main dif-
ferences between W&L and F&M. The Gener-
als took 12 less shots than the 40 attempted by
the Diplomats. Generals’ goalie, sophomore
Patrick Jennings, made 10 saves out of the 22
shots that were on target. Diplomats’ goalie,
ﬁrst-year Cameron Setian, made just 4 saves
out of 15 shots that were on target.

The Generals return to the ﬁeld when they
face top-ranked Salisbury on Wednesday. The
home game will be at 4:00pm on Wilson Field.

Reviving old juriali piriciples

Keynote speaker discusses traditional principles in Journalism connecting with new technology

ByTommyKent
STAFF WRITER

Dan Gillmor, the founding director of
the Knight Center for Digital Media En-
trepreneurship, gave the keynote address
in the. Stackhouse Theater for the 53"‘
Media Ethics Institute last friday. The
title of his talk was “Media Ethics in a
Digital Age: Traditional Principles Col-
lide with New Tools and Tactics.”

In introducing Gillmor to the stage,
Professor Wasserman, a Knight Profes-
sor for Journalism Ethics at Washing-
ton and Lee, said, “Every ordinary per-
son with internet access can get his/her
hands on more information than the most
resourceful journalist could have a gen-
eration ago.”

Wasserrnan described Gillmor, whose

lecture and the realities of an internet
where all can participate, Gillmor said,
“This is going to be a shared responsibil-
ity to get the ethical issues right, notjust
for the journalists.”

Elaborating on the appearance of this
new media and distinguishing it from tra-
ditional print journalism, Gillmor said,
“In the past we created stuff, we made
media, then we distributed it. Now, we
create it and we stick it someplace online
and then people ﬁnd it and come and get
it. Consumers are now creators and col-
laborators.”

Gillmor attempted to make clear what
constitutes journalism on the internet.
Using his own credibility scale, Gill-

tant to return to principles in addressing
these issues, these principles being both
the communities’ responsibility, for all
individuals who use the internet, those
formally known as the audience who are
now collaborators, and also for the jour-
nalists who create the media. Gillmor
said, as an overarching principle, that it
is important to use media, not consume
it.

The ﬁve principles for consum-
ers include skepticism in everything,
judgment, research, free thinking, and
techniques for creating media and un-
derstanding how the media persuades.
Gillmor elaborated on the principle of
skepticism by stating, “We have a new

While describing the free thinking
principle, Gillmor stressed the impor-
tance of “going outside your comfort
zone in politics and culture” and “chal-
lenging your own assumptions.” Gill-
mor said, “When I started getting sure
about things, was when I was most likely
to be wrong.”

Gillmor stated that what used to be
called the 24-hour news cycle is now
more aptly title 14,400 second news
cycle, signifying how quickly news ap-
pears on the intemet to the satisfaction
of consumers who are wired for fast.
One of the downsides to this fast-pace is
that major news stations can sometimes
get things widely wrong, for instance in

of a certain article to receive an e-mail if
corrections were made.

Gillmor said that journalists should
be independent of their work, to not
have conﬁict of interests, and cited I.F.
Stone, an investigative reporter from
the l950’s, as a model of independent
journalism. Gillmor also said journalists
should tell readers “how you are doing
the reporting” and “when you make a
mistake, to say it loudly,” highlighting
the transparency principle.

In closing, Gillmor departed from his
lecture on ethical principles to remind
the audience that “liberty is fragile.”
Gillmor said, “The world of new me-

case, if you take geology, I suggest tak-
ing it with Professor Low. And more
speciﬁcally, if you get the chance, taking
his economic geology class.

There are several reasons for
this. For one, he is young, which means
he knows about computers and technol-
ogy. I think everyone has been in the
situation of watching an elderly profes-
sor, on the overhead, attempt to locate
the “go” or “sound” button while the
class looks on in embarrassment. Fi-
nally someone raises their hand, “Um,
professor, I think you might want to try
unplugging the earbuds?” Anyhow, no
one will have that problem in Professor
Low’s class as almost everything is elec-
tronic. r

We don’t even have a text-
book. Instead we just read articles online
and a blog that he writes. The blog con-
tains such gems as, “The EIA is smoking
crack if it thinks that crude oil will sell
for $50/barrel in 2035.” Amusing and
educational, now that’s winning.

within the first year of an undergradu-
ate’s time at W&L, a student undergoes a
form of “sorting” that prescribes him or
her to a speciﬁc walk of life for the fol-
lowing years. The fact that the spheres of
student life on campus are so conﬁning
for students has created a strong system
of segregation that is not immediately
obvious. ‘

This is especially true for sorority
women — and while I will readily admit
to having a lack of knowledge about the
inner workings of the sororities since I
am an independent, the following views
were expressed by many sorority women
at the W&L Women’s Leadership Sum-
mit taking place this past weekend. Once
you join a speciﬁc sorority, your life be-
gins to revolve around this identity: you
eat at the sorority house, go to sorority
meetings, and attend social functions
with your sorority sisters. Even your

to the Editor” section. Apparently, an
individual named Elaine Neal from Bea-
versdam, Va. took issue with an article
on coal energy that the magazine had
written. She wrote what she thought was
a scathing rebuttal. But apparently she
had no idea what she was talking about.
Prof. Low proceeded to take us through
every line and show us just why she was
such a complete idiot. It was great.

Professsor Low is also Very pa-
tient with the non-science oriented. Our
ﬁrst homework assignment involved
making graphs from Excel data. I had
heard of “Excel” before, like the name
sounded familiar. I had no idea how to
use it. So I went to Prof. L0w’s oﬂice to
ask for help. I told him I had just been
thinking of plotting the little points on
graph paper but could he tell me how to
openéthe Excel thing ﬁrst? He proceeded
to show me how there were thousands
and thousands of data points and there
was no way I could possibly plot them
all. And he said all of this without laugh-
ing at all. I was very impressed.

Our last homework assignment
was my favorite. Apparently, it is a com-

hel Urban encourages W&L s udents to leave their comfort zones

spective sororities. And whether or not
you actually fulﬁll these stereotypes
does not always factor in how other
people identify or interact with you.
Women from other sororities (and even
independents) will oftentimes judge a
woman depending on the sorority she
is in, which discourages strong relation-
ships between women of differing social
spheres.

Fraternity men face a similar situa-
tion but differ in some regards. There are
more fraternities represented at W&L
compared to sororities, and the frater-
nity houses are very spread out around
Lexington. Men also eat at the fraternity
houses everyday like sorority members,
and a fraternity member’s daily deci-
sions are strongly dictated by the fra-
ternity and its members — pledgeship

.being a great example. Because of this

set—up of student life, fraternity men and
sorority women mainly interact during
classes and social functions like parties.
This makes it harder for women to de-
velop non-romantic relationships, which
would really help the gender divide at
W&L.

Furthermore, independents are of-
ten placed into their own category by
default. For example, I was in an orga-
nization wherein the female members
wanted to have a meeting over dinner
in one of the sorority houses. This idea
was soon dropped since I am restricted
from eating meals at any of the sorority
houses because of my non-Greek affili-

mon saying in the oil and gas industry
that “Saudi Arabia is the Saudi Arabia of
oil,” meaning that Saudi Arabia, easily
the greatest producer of oil, is, well, the
largest producer of oil. This has spawned
other sayings along the same lines, such
as “Canada is the Saudi Arabia of tar

get extra credit. Mine lost. It was, “Pro-

tactic. Some of my favorite entries were:
“Taco bell is the Saudi Arabia of higher
viscosity.” “Exell is the Saudi Arabia of
uselessness.” And “Tiger Woods is the
Saudi Arabia of cheaters.” I have no idea

ation — even if sorority members can
eat at other houses besides their own

vantage of). And even though indepen-
dents choose not to be aﬁiliated with any

labels of “independents” and “GDI”

plus you might even fall in love with the
subject, become a geology major, and
make a huge fortune working for an oil
company instead of, say, working as an
underpaid Hill staffer which is probably
where a politics degree will get you. And
take Professor Low. I’m telling you, he
really is the Saudi Arabia of fun, inter-

I encourage you to step outside of

and the preconceived notions associated
with them.

The result of this system of student
life is that W&L students have a ten-
dency to get “stuck” "in their walks of
life here, rarely venturing outside of the
sphere they inhabit. It’s amazing that, at
such a small university, I really interact
with only a small portion of the people
here. But when we stay in our comfort
zones, we’re really stunting our own
growth as individuals. There are so many
great people on campus, whether Greek,
independent, male, or female, and they
come from so many walks of life. Get-
ting to know all sorts of people can real-
ly push the boundaries of our own ways
of thinking, and we can learn more about
ourselves through the process.

talk to someone, even if it might be awk-
ward at ﬁrst. Just remember those won-
derful meet-and-greet skills you honed
as an entering freshman.

Just don’t let stereotypes dictate your
views about other men and women.
When we place others into a speciﬁc cat-
egory or identity, we’re unfairly hurting
them as well as our social atmosphere on
campus. We should work towards mak-
ing the word “acceptance” synonymous
to student life at W&L. And that ac-
ceptance shouldn’t be limited to certain
individual groups but rather across the
spectrum of the student body. It’s hard
to combat the segregation that seems to
happen naturally on this campus, but if
we are aware of the issue, we can deﬁ-
nitely change it. *

For those of you (males) reading
this that are unaware, Pinterest.com is a
self—described “online pinboard” where
one has individualized thumbtack-like
boards onto which she can virtually
“pin” the link to the website of whatever
strikes her fancy. These links take the
form of images that appear in a virtual
feed of other people’s pins, or rather,
one’s “followers” and those they are
“following.” The mechanism of Pinter-
est allows the pinner to take a cyber pic-
ture of anything they see online, whether
it be clothes, recipes, or my (personal fa-
vorite) wedding paraphernalia, and dis-
play it for their followers to see.

This idea appeals to the core of the
common female in two ways: not only
does it allow her to publicly display how
possibly cute and trendy her interests

are, but it allows her to do it in a neat
and organized way. Not to mention the

All of that being said (and despite
my obvious personal obsession with
Pinterest), recent mental examination
of its deeper implications about my own
behavior and that of society at large has
lead me to some slightly disturbing con-
clusions. The underbelly of Pinterest,
you might call it. That is, I have started
to wonder...what does it say about me
as an independent and conﬁdent woman
that the only time I feel comfortable
enough to exhibit my personal interests
is on a website?

Furthermore, the irony of the site is
that its basis in individuality and per-
sonal expression derives from the indi-
viduality and expression of other people.
Picture the average pinner, hiding behind
the shield of their computer screen, ob-
serving a continuous feed of pins and
eagerly “re—pinning” the ones they take
an interest in. I myselfhave said on mul-
tiple occasions what an “ego boost” it
gives me when I get that little email hap-
pily informing me that someone has re-
pinned one ofmy pins. Wow, that person
must like me and think I am pretty neat!

No. What they like is my recycled ex-
pression of the image that someone else
originally recycled, and so on. While the
combination of pins and boards do cre-
ate a collage of inspiration and personal
expression, I would be pressed to ﬁnd a
pinner who genuinely explores or even
visits the links to the items they pin. Per-

Smothered

sonally, the website has led me to a few
useful or entertaining online nooks, but
the majority of my -pins remain idly on
their boards gathering virtual dust as I
constantly replace them with different

' images ofthings I like in the moment.

Another subtly disturbing aspect of
the site is the sheer wordlessness of it.
When trying to convince my friends
to get a Pinterest account, I- have been
known to compare Pinterest to “Tumblr,
but without the hipster vibe and angsty
posts” (forgive me, Tumblr goers). The
merit to this is that, to put it bluntly, no
one really cares about reading someone
else’s virtual diary. Or at least no one
cares about reading the average Joe’s
(or Annie’s). In this way, Pinterest al-
lows for self-expression without the fear
of being judged for revealing too much.
But what does that say not only about us
as Pinterest users, but as readers? Are
we so self aware that we think people
will judge our thoughts and emotions
if we put them out there boldly, off the
Internet, for the world to see? What will
become of a society where the written
word is shunned or feared?

I feel I should wrap this up by admit-
ting that, despite these dark thoughts, I
will continue to remain a self-confessed

Pinterest addict. I do not regretitaking the

“virpinity” of my friends this weekend. I
just hope that my fellow pinners and I
will begin to pin more consciously ofthe
fact that we may not be as individual as
we seem, and will not get too wrapped
up in the ephemeral nature of the site. Be
selective with your pins, my friends—
don’t pin something you wouldn’t ac-
tually use your powers of creativity to
design, and, perhaps, even pin your own

version of one day. More than dreamers,

we must be doers. More than re-pinners,
we must be pinners.

Students, faculty Take Back the Night ~

At the 5th annual event, community members came together to makestand against sexual violence at the Cohen Amphitheater

By Cynthia Lam
copv EDITOR

SPEAK and One in Four hosted
the 5th annual Take Back the Night at
7:00 p.m. in the Cohen Amphitheater
last Thursday. The campus-wide event
brought students, faculty members, and
the entire W&L community together to
celebrate the resilient strength of sexual
assault survivors and take a powerful
stand against sexual violence.

According to incoming SPEAK
President Johanna Cho: “The main goal
of [Take Back the Night] was to show
campus support for survivors of sexual
violence, assault, and rape, as well as
give a voice to those who have gone
through such experiences. While it sup-
ports survivors by giving them a chance
to tell their personal story, it also serves
to raise awareness about sexual assault
and rape on campus.”

The night began with an opening

speech by SPEAK President Chelsea‘

Gloeckner, who talked about the impor-
tance of breaking the silence and raising
awareness about dating violence and
sexual assault, which are prevalent is-
sues here at W&L.

“Our statistics prove that we have
twice the national average of sexual as-

' saults on our campus. I have had many
‘ people ask if those statistics are real, or

if we just make them up. Why would
we ever want to make them up? Too
many people are sexually harassed, as-
saulted, and raped at W&L, and that is
why these organizations that stand up to
ﬁght against this violence and assault or
so important,” said Gloeckner, a senior.
This was followed by poetry and
prose readings from members of SPEAK.
They gave voice to victims of sexual as-
sault, who had all too often gone unheard
due to the silence surrounding this issue.
This silence, according to Cho, is one of
the most devastating forces contributing

to the problem at W&L.
“Incidents go unreported all the time.
One of the ﬁrst things you hear as a

. freshman is, ‘This campus is so small.

Everyone knows everyone’s business.’
When sexual assault is that ‘business,’
a victim’s struggle with rape or sexual
assault is tremendously harder in such a
tight-knit community, one where assault-
ers can be friends [or] your classmates,”
said Cho, ajunior. “The combination of
the small size and

“I thought I was going to easily keep
it all together and ﬂy through the speech
with all smiles... that didn’t happen,”
said Cho. “But I’m glad I did it because
it was a challenge to talk to a huge au-
dience about something I almost never
talk about with anyone, and being able to
accomplish that, being extremely honest
and open with my peers, gives me hope
that people will care more about these
issues. And I hope my story served as

happening on our campus,” said ﬁrst-
year Amira Hegazy.
Added ﬁrst-year Catherine Elder:
“I came...because I wanted to hear and
support everyone. I was expecting to be
very moved by the speakers, but I was
pleasantly surprised at how well it was
planned out to make the experience that
much more meaningful.”
The night continued with an uplifting
performance from Jubilee of “Signed,
Sealed, and Delivered.”

Violence Preven-
tion Dr. Jennifer
Sayre, who spoke
about the resound-
ing impact of sex-
ual violence, also
addressed this is-
sue by urging au-
dience members to look beyond the im-
mediate consequences.

“Students are profoundly affected by
[sexual assault] in terms directly and in-
directly,” said Sayre. “The direct effects
of violence can be devastating incfuding
marked anxiety, problems with sleep, at-
tention, concentration, and a broad range
of trauma-related challenges. When
someone’s friend, roommate, or roman-
tic partner is coping with violence it can
also be devastating. There is a ripple ef-
fect across our entire community.”

These daunting truths set the stage for
the most empowering part of the night, as
students took turns going up to the mike
to share their personal stories as survi-
vors of sexual assault. For most, this
was the ﬁrst time they had ever talked
about their experiences aloud in public.

going through their recovery process.”

The powerful, often heartbreaking
stories left a lasting impact on the au-
dience, who listened respectfully and
offered their support for the survivors
throughout the night. Some students
cried during the stories, while others
hugged and held on to each other for re-
assurance and encouragement.

“I haven’t been to anything like Take
Back the Night before, but I was really
glad I decided to go. It was really pow-
erful and emotionally charged, whether
you know someone who has been sexu-
ally assaulted, if you are a victim or not,
[because] the girls’ stories take hold of
you and really bring to light how crush-
ing sexual assault can be and how we all
need to take a stand to prevent it from

of the W&L community
walked together and lit
up the night.

Said ﬁrst-year SPEAK
member Maggie Voel-
zke: “SPEAK organizes
Take Back the Night as a
visual reminder that sex-
ual assault is a real and present problem,
even on our wonderful campus... [We]
work to ensure the discussion on sexual
violence doesn’t end with the closing of
the night. SPEAK strives to keep this is-
sue in the minds of W&L students not
only to raise awareness, but so that our
community can become a safe haven for
survivors.”

After attending Take Back the Night,
students discovered a newfound respon-
sibility to themselves and their peers.
Said Hegazy: “As a female, I feel like I
need to go to [these] events so I can learn

how to better help myself and my friends’

ifthey become victims. It really could be
me or any other woman on campus on
that stage telling a horriﬁc story of rape,
it is our responsibility to go listen and
respect them as survivors to learn what

more we can do to secure our campus.”

With the large turnout this year, many
are hopeful that more students will step
up in the ﬁght against sexual violence.
Said Sayre: “Our community will be
safer when enough individuals make the
choice to do their part to be actively and
visibly intolerant of violence. Individu-
als can educate themselves about how
to be proactive bystanders, look out for
their friends, and let everyone in their
lives know this matters to them.”

Added Cho: “We need to open up our
dialogue. We need to talk to each other
as friends and not as us being solely edu-
cators but just another student who cares
about the problems of sexual assault and
rape. I’m not one to cry a lot in public,
or ever. But every time I hear that a girl
has been assaulted at W&L, I’m stunned
and, cliche’ I know, but my heart breaks.
I think our whole campus needs less of
those heartbreaks. SPEAK is in no way
trying to scare girls with these stories.
We just want to better prepare them with
the realities of our campus.”

, In order to fully eliminate sexual as-
sault from campus, students must work
together to take a stand. Said Voelzke:
“The reality is that by the time you have
graduated someone you know will prob-
ably have dealt with this in some way. I
want W&L to be a community in which
victims can be open with their experi-
ences and be supported not only by close
friends, but by students en masse.”

Added Gloeckner: “I wanted to be-
come part ofthe movement to end sexual
assault at W&L. I felt like I could be a
voice for those who couldn’t speak about
it... No matter what relationship you
[have] with sexual assault, you can still
be extremely moved and inspired to ﬁght
sexual violence alongside your peers.”

It’s a case of Spring Fever?

Certain ﬁosh donned costumes, threw glitter and made sandwiches last week .. but none were harmed

By Anna DiBenedetto
STA F F w RITE R

Spring Fever is here and it has come
in with a bang. Oddly enough, the fever
seems to have only infected 29 ﬁrst-
years in the Phi Kappa Psi ﬁatemity.
They showed signs of extreme energy
and excessive happiness starting last
Tuesday. —

One young man, Albert Civitarese,

' showed his concern for the safety of his

fellow undergraduates by suiting up in a
cop uniform, whistle and all, and direct-
ing the student pedestrians outside of El-
rod Commons.

Another young man, Matthew How-
ell, decided to teach some of his friends
the art of yoga on the lawn, while an-
other friend, Nick Biumi, chose to play
T-ball by himself next to them.

An avid lover of Disney movies, Ste-
phen Moore decided to live out his life-
long fantasy of being Peter Pan. Moore,
dressed in black tights, a green shirt and
armed with a short sword, ran through
campus sprinkling “fairy dust” on stu-
dents and shouting, “To Neverland! To
Neverland!”

Christian Kennedy, dressed in a black
cape, took on the role of Death. Said one
student: “Kennedy likes to walk behind
the smokers on campus and follow them.
Then he will write down their names in
his little black book. He is trying to raise
awareness of lung cancer.”

The absurdity intensiﬁed as the week
continued. In commemoration of the
15th anniversary of Nintendo’s Poke-
mon, Morgan Moskal decided to cel-
ebrate by dressing up as Ash Ketchum,
the lead character from the TV show.

The entire week, he enjoyed searching
for the Pokemon he had always heard
about as a child. When asked if there
was a certain character he was trying to
catch, he responded, “If I can catch Ab-
sher Puff, then I’ll be the world’s great-
est Pokemon master. But right now, I’m
just trying to catch ‘em all.”

David Robinson, after studying me-
dieval architecture in his spare time, ex-
pressed his love for the Middle Ages by
acting as a gargoyle. Robinson, with a
painted grey face and attachable wings,

during the writing of this article

perched himself on the bench outside of
Graham-Lees dorm.

Also outside on the lawn was aspir-
ing sandwich chef, Ian Hooley. Hooley,
known for his specialty P_B&J’s, decided
to share his talent with fellow students
by giving away free sandwiches.

Unfortunately, Spring Fever seems
to have burnt itself out, as the Phi could
ﬁnd no more signs of unusual behavior
by the end of the week.

Baul mystics take Islam, Hinduism and Christianity and “sing it, ’

By Jenny Fugate
STAFF WRITER

Barefoot, white chalk on his fore-
head, and dressed in a striking orange
robe, Babukishan Das Baul ﬁlled Elrod
Commons with Bengali fold music and
enlightened the audience on the Baul
tradition.

This Bengali Indian is one of the last
followers of the Baul tradition — an an-
cient brand of spirituality that has been
passed down and kept alive through oral
tradition for centuries.

His wife Trishula summed up Baul
mysticism, saying: “The Bauls take

/

the best of Muslim religion, Hinduism,
Christianity... etc, grind it into a juice,
and then sing it.”

The Bauls are travelling minstrels
that use their unique form of folk music
to communicate to their audience their
concept of spirituality based on love and
a relationship with God.

The strange instruments he played,
such as the iconic “ektara,” with his lilt-
ing, rich voice combined with his repeat-
ed admonitions to the audience to close
their eyes or dance intentionally created

from an alum

When The Uni\‘crsit_\' was in the
midst of the last debate over co-cduca-
lion (there \\ ere several) there were bum-
per stickers that objected to the histori-
cal possibility that W&L would change
course. The bumper stickers cynically
read “\\"./\SlllN(iT()N AND Ll-Il(ill"

and were popular with our friends at
Hampdcn-Sydney whom we would see
when we went “down the road“ at Sweet
Briar. Mary Baldwin and Hollins. We
all should know that tradition fell hard
as a close votc changed the course of
our wonderful school. Many years later

an almost otherworldly atmosphere.

As Babukishan transitioned from one
song to next, he explained more about
the tenets of the Baul philosophy. He
was quick to dispel any preconceptions
of himself as a gypsy; rather he identi-
ﬁed himself and the Bauls as mystics, or
“spiritual messengers.” I

Heiexplained that one of the funda-
mental beliefs of the Bauls is that reli-
gion is merely a human creation, not
something ordained by God himself.

“Before we were born into a Muslim

family or a Hindu family we had no re-
ligion. And when we leave this earth we
will return to God with no religion,” said
Babukishan. _

A large part of Babukishan’s per-
formance was audience interaction. He
repeatedly exhorted the crowd to close
their eyes and “let your soul dance” in

order to create a more energetic ambi- I

ence. He alsoallowed several people to
accompany him using some ofhis instru-
ments.

Baseball sweeps doubleheader

Pitchers Smith and Shaw both have strong outings on the mound

By Zack Richards
STA F F W R I T E R

The Washington and Lee Generals had the
luck of the Irish today, as they swept the Guil-
ford Quakers with a pair of ninth inning come-
back victories at Captain Dick Smith Field,
extending their home win streak to six games.

On this St. Patrick’s Day, the Washington
and Lee squad won two vital Old Dominion
Athletic Conference games with solid pitching
and clutch hitting deﬁning the play.

Pat Smith, the senior pitcher from New Jer-
sey started the ﬁrst game of the double header.
He surrendered one unearned run on four hits
in nine innings, allowing the Generals to stay
close until the offense could provide some
support.

Luke Deary, the junior starting catcher of
the ﬁrst game, knocked in the winning run on
a double. CJ Thompson scored after reaching
on an error and advancing when Alston James
was hit by a pitch.

Michael Decembrino scored in the eighth
frame to tie the game, when Jonathon Stutts
took Ryan Lindsay’s pitch for a single. Lind-
say relieved Will James after seven scoreless
innings.

After the ﬁrst ninth inning rally, Ian Shaw

took the mound in hopes of winning his fourth
game in a row, yet he would not get the win on
his 21 st birthday.

After the game, despite pitching well in
seven and a third innings and surrendering
three earned runs, Shaw said, _“Today I would
have liked to have kept a few runs off the
board.”

Like Smith in the ﬁrst game, Shaw allowed
Washington and Lee to stay close until the of-
fense could come though, as they did in the
seventh and ninth innings scoring two and one
runs, respectively.

Alex Mait knocked in Will Salley to score
the Generals’ ﬁrst run in the bottom of the
fourth inning on a single. The hit gave the’
team a short lead, until the Quakers scored
three runs between the ﬁfth and sixth innings.
Mait went three for three in the second game
with the one RBI.

Catching up with him after the game, Mait
said, “I had lots of conﬁdence today. I came
back from the SVU game and was feeling re-
ally good at the plate,” after his ﬁrst collegiate
perfect game at the plate.

It wasn’t until the bottom of the seventh

that Washington and Lee would strike again,
tying Guilford with two runs off of singles
from both James and Decembrino.

Junior pitcher Eric Wisotsky replaced
Shaw in the seventh, pitching an inning and
allowing one hit. It was the hit given up in the
eighth that led to Jake Rudolph coming out of
the bullpen to throw a single pitch and record
a double play.

Commenting on his outing Wisotsky said,
“Despite not having my best stuff, I was able
to work around everything,” which summed
up both of the Generals’ victories.

After solid pitching from the bullpen,
Washington and Lee used another clutch hit
from Stutts to win the second game. After
walking and stealing second, Decembrino was
able to score Stutts’ blooper to right ﬁeld.

Rudolph earned the victory, as the Quak-
ers’ Micah Winterstein recorded a loss in two
and a third innings in relief of starter Borja
Jones-Berasaluce.

Since starting the season with ﬁve losses,
the Generals have won eleven of their last
fourteen.

The l4th ranked women’s lacrosse team

Both teams played with a sense of urgency,

Liberal Arts connects with Ads

AdLibs oﬂers students an outlet to build careers in advertising, marketing and PR with a Liberal Arts education

By Neil Haggerty
N E w 5 E D ITO R

With careers in Advertising and other
related ﬁelds increasing in popularity
with students, Washington and Lee Uni-
versity will be hosting its second AdLibs
conference to connect a Liberal Arts edu-
cation to these careers from March 29-30.

According to the AdLibs website, the
conference will allow students to learn
about-advertising and other careers in-
volving persuasive communications.
Students will have the opportunity to
hear from alumni working in advertising
related ﬁelds and learn about the courses
at W&L that are related to these careers.

“Not everyone is cut out for a job at
a big bank or ﬁnancial ﬁrm and I think
W&L students have become more aware
of this and have started to consider other
options,” said Katie Hatﬁeld ’l2. “The
conference aims to bridge the gap be-
tween majors and show that careers in ad-
vertising, Public Relations and marketing
are not speciﬁc to those with majors in the
C-School.”

“Perhaps most importantly, students
from all classes and majors across cam-
pus will see reflected in alumni how a
strong liberal arts educations will prepare
them for success in persuasive communi-
cations and consumer engagement,” ac-
cording the to W&L AdLibs website.

C-School Professor Amanda Bower
said, “Mass Communications and Busi-
ness Administration are probably obvious
examples of majors suited to possible ca-
reers in advertising. However, I do think
students would be surprised to ﬁnd out
the types of majors and expertise suited
to advertising.”

These other majors that are all poten-
tial building blocks for advertising ca-
reers include psychology, sociology, an-
thropology, religion, philosophy, english,
theater, music and studio arts, according
to Hatﬁeld.

“Ad careers require critical thinking,
an ability to assimilate new information
and form original ideas based on that new

information. Given our small environ-
ment [at W&L], you are also used to lots
of criticism and getting better,” Bower
said.

Bower said that the idea for the con-
ference started with students asking ques-
tions about how to build connections
between their education at W&L to both
professors and alumni who are involved
in ﬁelds related to consumer engagement
and persuasive communication.

“It had started to reach a point where
I couldn’t handle all of the needs of our
students, so last year we had a few alums
come back and sit on a panel about what
agency life is like,” said Bower.

At last year’s conference, small group
interviews were conducted with agen-
cies including Euro RSCG, which hired
alumni including Courtney Berry ’05 and
“realized the quality of our students and
was interested in perhaps hiring more,”
added Bower.

The schedule for the 2012 AdLibs con-
ference includes career navigation panels,
where students will learn how to appro-
priately plan out their careers while at
W&L as well as panels on speciﬁc careers
in advertising and the types of agencies
that graduates can work for. The confer-
ence will also include career development
workshops to help students “package and
present their resumes, cover letters and
job interview and networking skills,” ac-
cording to go.wlu.edu/adlibs.

Speakers at the conference include
Keynote Speaker John Zamoiski, Chair-
ment and CEO of Bottlerocket Marketing

Merchant gives Stein lecture

History Professor uses his dissertation on Laurence Keitt as a starting point for a lecture on his wife, Sue Keitt

ByTommy Kent
STAFF WRITER

History Professor Holt Merchant
gave an endowed lecture on the topic
“Sue Keitt: Real Life Scarlett O’Hara?”
in the Northen Auditorium last Thursday
at 8:00 p.m. ‘

President Ken Ruscio said that “the
faculty are the core of what W&L is
about” and that Martin ‘74 and Brooke
Stein set up the endowment in order to
recognize an accomplished scholar and
exceptional teacher.

Professor Ted Delaney, the introducer
and head of the history department, de-
scribed Merchant as “one of the truly
beloved professors on W&L’s campus.”

Merchant said he arrived at his lec-
ture topic as an extension on his disserta-
tion on Laurence Keitt, a South Carolina
congressman who served from I853 to
1860 and “ﬁre-eater” whose “rhetoric
got him ‘in a lot of ﬁghts.” Laurence
courted Sue Keitt, who became the topic
of his lecture.

Merchant said: “If you historians
are expecting a historic point, there isn’t
one. I ’m not here to reverse the claims
of previous historians. I think it is good
social history. It is a good story.”

Sue came from a prominent, wealthy
family that owned 120 acres and 150
slaves. As gathered from the only exist-
ing photograph, Merchant said, “[Sue]
was a remarkably attractive person.
Flashing eyes. Magniﬁcent form. Ac-
knowledged beauty.” . .

Merchant added, Sue wasn’t “at all
eager to ﬁnd a husband, and especially
not Keitt.” Merchant said that part of
the evidence suggests that she had had a
previous engagement, but that she even-
tually married Laurence Keitt.

After Sue and Laurence had been
married for only 6 months, Sue was al-

ready complaining and writing long let-
ters expressing her fears and frustration
about life in Washington D.C. She said
in a letter sent back home, “I don’t like
Washington. I want to rest, ride, and
fatten up and keep you and father com-
pany.”

Merchant said it was clear that her-
“transformation from sought-after
Southern Belle to dutiful wife was far
from complete.” By mid-December
1859 Sue was writing, “I detest Wash-
ington. I have never fancied politics. I
am tired ofold John Brown and the black
Republicans.” - I

According to Merchant, during their
courtship, Laurence Keitt had pursued
her “aggressively”; she only accepted
after his ﬁfth try with the condition that
he resign his seat in Congress and travel
throughout Europe with her. When they
got back, Laurence would become a cot-
ton planter.

iMerchant said that Laurence “re-
markably agreed,” even while Sue had
called off the marriage several times.
It was during the “furor caused by the
caning of Sumner, that she broke off her
engagement” completely and didn’t see
Laurence for two years, Merchant said.

Merchant described how Laurence
tried to forget his lost love back in D.C.
by his attendance of endless balls with

‘ an endless number of beautiful belles.

However, Sue _did not forget about Lau-
rence and after two years wrote to him
and eventually married him. After trav-
eling Europe for ﬁve months Merchant
said Sue “was ready to settle down in
Paris for serious study.” Merchant said
that Sue thought Laurence should avoid
the “little disputes” that were taking
place at the capital and did not want to

go back to D.C.

Merchant, prompting laughter from
the audience, said, “The country was
blowing itself to bits at this point, and
she called these ‘little disputes’?”

Back in Europe, Merchant said that
Laurence offered to let Sue stay but
she refused and returned home, bitterly
disappointed for having sacriﬁced her
dreams to the “god of politics” as she
phrased it. “The life of a wife of a ﬁre-
eating Congressman was anything but
pleasant. She complained of boredom.
She hated D.C. She refused to visit Con-
gress because she said, ‘I fear I’ll catch a
bullet in the head,”’ said Merchant.

Merchant said, “Sue was not your
stereotypical Southern Belle. She was
beautiful, but she did not have a head
full of fluff. She was intelligent.” Mer-
chant said that she encouraged Laurence
to write about more moving matters, and
that she “invariably tried to get [Lau-
rence] to be more careful.” Laurence
himself wanted to write a history of co-
lonial South Carolina.

After declining an offer for a meet-
ing with the President, Sue said, “I have
no fancy for the story-telling old man.”
However, Sue later met President Bu-
chanan and said he had “one of the most
quizzical faces,” having an eye disorder
that caused him to cock his head.

The President described Sue as “the
most cultivated, fascinating woman in
Washington,” said Merchant. He added
that Sue “absolutely loved her conquest
of Washington society,” even though
she described the city as “full of rowdy
congressmen and insipid dancing young
men.” ‘

According to Merchant,,Sue even-
tually visited the Capital building, and

said: “Was this disorderly mob really the
Congress of the United States, the as-
sembled wisdom of a nation?” Sue did
eventually develop an interest in poli-
tics to the extent that she endorsed her
husband as the ideal running mate with
Stephen Douglas. Merchant said Sue
believed that “Douglass could win back
the South only by putting an ultra on the
ticket.”

Merchant said that like Laurence, Sue
wanted not to save the Republic but to
break it up. Sue wanted Keitt to be on
the Democratic ticket as a springboard to
be president ofa new Union.

None of her hopes, however, came
to fruition. The Democratic Party split,
giving Lincoln a presidency that “made
secession unavoidable,” Merchant said.

Laurence became bored by his posi-
tion in the Southern government, said
Merchant. Spurred by his desire for
“glory on the battleﬁeld,” Laurence
formed an infantry division and defend-
ed Charleston harbor for a large part of
the Civil War until he was called to ﬁght
at Cold Harbor where new battle tactics
did not work well with his idealized vi-
sion of “drawing a sword on horseback
and charging,” Merchant said.

However, Laurence lined his brigade
in battle formation, charged straight
ahead, and was mortally wounded. After
Laurence’s death, Sue disappeared from
the record except" for two instances, ac-
cording to Merchant.

Merchant said the first instance was
after she was forced to swear an oath to
the Union in order to keep her land. He
said that he stumbled upon the second
instance in a major collection of letters
in the South Carolina library 35 years
after having written his dissertation on

Laurence. Merchant said, “Siie was alive
again.”

In 1878, after Sue’s father died, she
became determined to hold onto the fam-
ily land. Merchant said that it is at this
point that the “Scarlett O’Hara bit comes
to the fore.”

Sue borrowed money from a nouveau
riche Irish businessman and bought back
the house at an auction. Merchant said
that she “set off to restore [the land] to
its antebellum prosperity before Sher-
man came and destroyed everything ex-
cept the house.” The Irishman, however,
loaned her the money at l8 percent inter-
est and Sue began to miss her payments.
When the Irishman pressed her, Sue told
him, “I will kill myself and I will come
back to haunt you into your grave.”

Merchant said that amazingly Sue
persevered and even increased the pros-
perity of the land. She borrowed money
to lure black tenets and became an un-
usually good plantation owner, treating
the black tenets well. She even some-
how found money to educate her daugh-
ter and almost married her daughter off
to Glover Cleveland, a “fate worse than
death” Merchant said, describing him as
the most boring President in history.

Merchant said that Sue Keitt’s estate
came to be worth a quarter of a million
dollars, which is remarkable when con-
sidering that she had been penniless be-
fore the Civil War and later, as a result of
the war, became a widow.

“She made herself into a real life
Scarlett O’Hara and I she proved she
didn’t need Rhett Butler to do it,” said
Merchant.

Why should you go to AdLibs?

Interested in advertising, marketing, or public relations but not a business major? Sounds like AdLibs is for you

By Katie Hatﬁeld
COLU M N IST

AdLibs is the Advertising and Liberal
Arts Conference here at W&L on this
coming Friday, March 30"‘.

This conference will showcase sever-
al alumni that have returned to talk about
the advertising, marketing, and public
relations industries and the many career
paths that are available within them as
well as workshops in which students can
meet with alums one—on-one for career
advice and resume/cover letter review.

The main goal of AdLibs is to show
that you don’t have to be a business ma-
jor to get involved in these fascinating
and rapidly growing industries. Agen-
cies don’t just want to hire a room full of
marketing majors (which is a good thing,
since we don’t even have one at W&L).

They look for people of all majors and
skill sets in order to understand the con-
sumer and create better advertising.

I think it sounds awesome, and here
are the top ﬁve reasons why I’m going
to attend and why I think you should too:

1. Find out more about the market-
ing, advertising, and public relations
industries through firsthand experi-
ence.

There’s nothing better than Ieaming
about the ins and outs of a career from
people who actually are a part of it. This
is the kind of information that you can’t
get out of a textbook or a class.

2. Meet and network with alumni.

Almost all of the AdLibs present-
ers are W&L grads, and because we are

W&L students, you know we can never
get enough of networking with the alum-
ni. Beyond that, however, the lineup is
stacked with cool people, cool jobs,
and cool life experiences. I mean one ‘of
them worked for the circus for six years.
That’s pretty neat.

3. Disband the myth of“Oh, you’re
a slightly unconventional major other
than Business Administration. What
are you going to do with that?”

AdLibs will allow those who at-
tend to explore different career options
other than the ones that seem obvious.
It can be difﬁcult to answer the skepti-
cally asked “what are you going to do
with that?” question. Especially if your
answer isn’t ‘graduate school’ or ‘teach-

ing.’ But AdLibs is here to help.

4. Participate in‘ something that
brings the entire campus together.

Who doesn’t love a little camarade-
rie? Since Mock Convention ended, I
know I’ve been hankering for something
else that would bring everyone on this
campus together more than Leybum on
a late Sunday afternoon. AdLibs will
bridge the gap between majors so that
those who haunt the science center,
C-School, or Lenfest can all mix and
mingle with one another. It’s a beautiful
thing.

5. Make your Friday productive.

Meet some talented people. Learn a
few things about fascinating industries.
Talk to some kids in your grade you

wouldn’t normally talk to. Get valuable
career advice. F eel fulﬁlled this coming
Friday.

I know I feel good about myself any
time that I’m actively doing something
for a few hours that’s not planning my
outﬁt for that night or poring over Pinter-
est for the umpteenth time.

Check out the website, go.wlu.edu/
adlibs, to sign up and ﬁnd more inforrna-
tion, the schedule of events and a list of
presenters.

CD L” H N I 5 1, members of our

prestigious club,
and it’s a personal point of pride for
the majority of current members. How-
ever this inherent allegiance to tradition
among W&L members causes some con-
ﬂict within the school.

Everyone who has any relationship
with any college institution loves com-
plaining about stuff. Professors and ad-
ministrative members bemoan the mor-
als of their clients, and anyone who has
met an eighteen - twenty-two-year-old
knows that he or she loves whining about
everything from the Nnamdi Asomugha
signing to Invisible Children’s frighten-
ingly close ties with the Ugandan gov-
ernment to the quality of the drank at
parties. It’s just what we do. So, if you

talk to pretty much every member of the
W&L community, he or she will ﬁnd
something that is wrong with the way
W&L currently functions. "At the same
time, pretty much every member of the
community will agree that W&L’s rich
and vibrant tradition makes it superior to
most other schools in the country. Here’s
the problem, most of the things people in
this community complain about (frater-

— nities, the party scene, the fourth ﬂoor of

Graham-Lees, etc.) are direct products
of W&L’s rich tradition. Basically, we
want things to change for the better, but
we also believe that tradition at W&L
has made everything good the way it is
now. \

Since this is by no means an exclu-
sive phenomenon to W&L and it’s been
going on for quite a while, humanity has
developed a pretty nice ﬁx to this con-
flict. All you have to do is say that things
were better way back when before the
new members came in and screwed ev-
erything up. By using this form of think-

ing, you can still complain about how .

rotten your surroundings are while also
honoring Tevye’s favorite word.

Using this form of thinking is espe-
cially vibrant at W&L and is most com-
monly used by seniors and directed to-
wards freshmen. During rush in 2008,
I was led to believe that W&L around

CLASSIFIEID

we freshmen could only imagine. How-
ever, since those glorious years when
“no seriously you could’ve hooked up
with any chick you wanted,” the admin-
istration has enacted its Top Secret Plan
to systematically rule out fun at W&L.
As a result, the fun levels at W&L have
seen logarithmic declines over the past
few years only to level off at Davidson
or even worse, Swarthmore levels of fun
sometime in the next two or three years
(i.e. around-the time the current fresh-
men are seniors).

When I became a senior, I Started tell-
ing this same story to younger students
at parties. As a senior, it’s easy to see the
change for myself. I was here three and
a half years ago, and so I’ve had a large
[enough range to View substantial change
in this institution. Professors have been
here longer, and I’ve heard many “this

tended three years ago, not because the
W&L itself is all that different, but rather
because you are the one that’s changed.
Obviously, this is self-evident and me
explaining it makes this column seem a
lot like the end of a Nickelodeon show.
Still, I think it’s a relatively important
point. This school has not profoundly
changed in the time that I’ve gone here,
and it’s strikingly similar to the school
that many alumni attended. It’s just that
our viewpoint of the whole situation has
changed.

Take the Speaking Tradition at W&L
as an example. Alumni and professors
constantly lament the death of the speak-
ing tradition on W&L’s campus. To them,
back in the day, students would always
go out of their way to say hello to each
other on campus regardless of social

statute or animosity between members. I

place isn’t the same as it used to be”
rants from them as well. I was all ready
to express these feelings in a nice little
comeback article. It had a pretty catchy
title: “How admissions and administra-
tion are changing W&L from a good
school on Forbes to a good school on
US News & World Report.” Trust me,
it would’ve made you totally forget that
I completely skirted writing a fraternity
rankings article this year. Only when I
started really thinking about writing this
article, I kept ﬁnding holes in my argu-
ment. Although I would really like to be-
lieve that this current freshmen class is
a bunch of bland goodie two shoes who
don’t really know how to throw down
and hang out, that’s simply not the case.
Like most senior members of this com-
munity, I was blinded by having a differ-.
ent relationship to the school than I did
when I was a freshman.

Since all of us students are going
through some form of puberty, it makes
sense that our lives drastically change
during the four years of college. Further-
more, the point of college is to change
or at least challenge you in some way,
so there’s bound to be a difference be-
tween your senior self and your fresh-
man self. So, by the time you become a
senior, of course you are going to see a
different institution than the one you at-

Nowadays, students can’t look up from
their damn cell phones to even acknowl-
edge the presence of other human beings
in the institution. That’s a fun thing about
which to complain, especially if you’re a
big Rodney Dangerﬁeld fan, but in real-
ity, the Speaking Tradition has arguably
gotten better at W&L over the years that
I have attended. Despite the fact that stu-
dents have wonderful gadgets in which
to stay in tune with everything that is
happening in the world while still play-
ing Draw Something, students at W&L
actually are better than most other kids
our age at saying hello to each other on
the Hill, and in my experience, it’s the

professors and administration who are

usually the most reluctant to return a
greeting on the hill. Only it’s much more
convenient for adults on campus to com-
plain that student aren’t living up to the
tradition that they themselves don’t re-
ally have to abide by.

The same goes for students though.
Parties aren’t much less chill then they
used to be. If someone still wants to rage
on Friday night, he or she still can. The
one or two fraternities getting in trouble
per year rule has stayed relatively con-
stant. Classes don’t seem to be that much
harder or easier than they used to be.
Yes, all these situations aren’t identical
to what they were in the past, but they

are not so radically diﬂ°erent that they
bear constant complaint.

There are only two real changes that
I have observed in student life over my
time at W&L. The ﬁrst is that parties
tend to end around midnight instead of
two in the morning. This is a direct result
of the town of Lexington’s 2010 effort to
make parties end at midnight, and, hey
look, they won that ﬁght pretty easily.
Once LexPo decided that it was neces-
sary to start raising hell once the clock
struck midnight, the Cinderella rule
started going into effect quickly. I’ve
already written about this plenty, so it’s
not worth going into the whole morality
of the deal, but over the last few months
as a result of this Cinderella rule, LexPo
has been relatively fairer in their arrests.
Now, when I say relatively, I mean rela-
tively, and they may just be making up
for the egregious acts they committed in
the ﬁrst couple of weeks of this school
year, but I have been hearing many less
complaints about LexPo lately. Yes, the
Cinderella rule did kill off Wednesday
night party nights and ragers can’t go
as late as they did a few years ago. That
has changed, but there are still late night
options, and you can now safely register
for classes on Thursday morning and ex-
pect a passing grade. It’s not great, but
there are worse things.

The only other real change in the stu-
dent body I have seen is in music choice.
Most parties throw in the obligatory pop
and country songs throughout the night,
but outside of those songs, mostly elec-
tric and dubstep music is played. Back
in the day, rap was the music de jour of
most parties. We have inserted Skrillex,
Avicii, and Coyote Kisses over the vi-
sionary minds of Kevin Rudolf, Kardinal
Ofﬁshall, and Jay Electronica. I’m pre-
posterously offended by the way these
new dubstep head have no respect for the
calming melodies of hip hops ﬁnest like
Lil B the Based God and Waka Flocka
Flame, but that’s just me.

Still, other than music and party
closing times, the school has not really
changed that much. The students are
relatively similar, although we do have
a better football team, and the social and
academic life is a lot like it has always
been. Parties are fun, classes are hard,
people get away with cheating when
they bring a case to an open trial, etc.
Life will go on in a pretty similar fashion
at W&L to the way it did ﬁve years ago.

So, in the end, things change, but they
don’t really change. You’re welcome for
wasting your time with this article. But,
remember, if Payton Manning can go

Hard to say.

that other cultures outside of the US
are terribly oppressive, since they force
women to wear more modest clothing.
While this might seem alien to us, I must
ask, is our culture so very different from
others?

In all cultures, there are speciﬁc so-
cial inﬂuences that affect what people
wear. Whereas in other countries it
might be harder to wear less clothing, it
is often the case that it is harder to wear
more clothing in our current fashion cul-
ture —just look at the images in adver-
tisements. The media often show images
of “the perfect woman.” She is tall, tan,
super skinny, and wearing clothes that
show off her body in the sexiest ways
possible. Because that’s what the mar-
ket says, right? “Sexy sells.” But while
very few can live up to this standard in

real life, the average woman is trying to

emulate her — buying the clothes, the
makeup, and planning the diet.
Eventually,vthose fashion trends reach

on being an “environment hating econo-I

' mist” with my double major in environ-

mental studies and economics. Just a
side note: He swims at Texas on a schol-
arship, so he’s not the brightest light on
the tree, but he made a statement I think
a lot of people tend to believe: that sav-
ing the economy and saving the environ-
ment are two opposing ideals and cannot

us at W&L and become norms. For ex-
ample: “the leggings trend.” During my
sophomore year, many people started
wearing black leggings without anything
on top of them. When women wear these
leggings, you can really see all aspects
of their lower bodies —— I mean every-
thing. As this trend became widespread
on campus among women of all body
types, I had the unfortunate experiences
of seeing women who do not realize
their leggings are not thick enough as
well as women drawing unwanted atten-
tion from male students, I often wonder

trend, or if they are just going along with
the rest of the student body.

In reality, the vast majority of women
are not stick—thin models, and they do
not need to feel pressured into wearing
sexy, tight, or revealing clothing. But
since we place expectations on ourselves
and each other to conform to fashion
norms, peer pressure becomes a huge

activist, but even I know that this isn’t
true. Let’s take the example of energy.
Coal is a major source of energy for our
country as well as the world. The bum-
ing of coal to produce energy emits CO2
into the atmosphere, a major component
of global warming. I’m going to assume
you will at least go with me on this glob-

Trite as it may seem, our simple con-
tradiction in taste got me thinking on a
deeper level: what does it say about a
personality if one would rather eat the
frosting then the cake? Most would con-
tend that the distinction is scientiﬁcally
taste bud driven, or perhaps effected
somehow by the mother’s diet in the
womb (here I must disagree, though, as
my mother admits to eating nothing short
of oatmeal and pickles while pregnant
with me). I, however, was drawn to the
deeper question presented by the cake
versus frosting issue: when enjoying a
piece of cake such as the one on the site,
maybe even at my own wedding, would
I rather be sharing it with someone who
also only liked the frosting? Or ‘would I
prefer that my eventual husband and I
be able to ‘conserve’ cake, and share a

this: how important is compatibility in a

Next time you choose your outﬁt,

and environmental worlds can unite.

‘ A large component in the upcoming
election is the need for jobs. Professor
Goldsmith frequently noted how every
candidate was the “jobs” candidate in his
macroeconomics course last semester.
To me, the answer seems obvious, but
because I feel like postponing my home-
work a little longer, allow meito spell it
out for you: jobs need to be created in
the renewable energy ﬁeld. Research and
development to perfect alternative forms
of energy such as wind and solar could
lead to an entirely new industry allow-
ing for an abundance of new jobs. Eco-
nomics, however, is not (completely)
political, but rather a focus on achieving
equilibrium and, therefore, efficient mar-
kets. On a basic level, both economics

Take another example. One of my
bestlfriends is known for her unique
way of eating PopTa1ts. She delicately
picks off the surrounding portion from
the fruit (?) ﬁlled center and munches
on their crumbly, shortbread like edges
instead. I asked her—if you saw a boy
at breakfast also picking off the edges
of his PopTart, would you be more at-

to picture two scenarios: one where she
and her husband split a package of Pop-
Tarts for breakfast, casually pinching off

the ends (feeding them to each other?) '

and sharing a chuckle over the discarded
middles they leave behind before they
kiss and depart for work. In the second,

These same emissions enrage the envi-

primary reason for global warming. Both
ﬁelds would conclude that emissions
need to be, at the very least, signiﬁcantly
reduced in order to achieve equilibrium
and save our environment. While this is
only one example, I have found in my
short time studying both ﬁelds that there
are many crossovers like this one where
economists and environmentalists are
ﬁghting for the same thing. Environmen-
talists and economists are not at a stand-
off - except for in Washington, where
they collectively continue to ﬁght for
regulations on CO2 emissions that politi-

Both situations certainly have the “cute”
factor, but which would truly be the bet-

I believe it is our nature as humans
to seek out people who are similar to us
as we form friendships and relationships.
However, the old adage that opposites at-
tract is an old adage for a reason. While
I still have not found an answer to this
question of compatibility versus similar-
ity in relationships, I can conclude that
when seeking out a partner in life, it is
crucial to not rule anyone out due to ei-
ther a shared trait or an opposing one.
After all, how cute are both the couple
who shares the Pop-Tart ‘and the one who
discards the middles? I urge you to keep
an open mind to the possible pros and
cons of both types of people in relation
to yourself. I’m also not ruling out the
idea of carrying a slice of cake with you

about the old
days. Ithink
about a six

Creek music festival, which consisted of
several D-list bands, but no one seemed

to care.

It is clear that over the course of my
stay at Washington and Lee, the fun
levels have gone down considerably.
During my freshman year, going out on
Mondays, Wednesdays or Thursdays
was not a big deal. If you happened to
have a slow night of work, or just felt
like having a little fun, you could talk
to the people on your hall and ﬁgure
something out. Now, a campus notice
couldn’t help you ﬁnd a buddy to hang
out with during the week.

A lot of the ‘decreased fun action
stems from local enforcement. Fresh-
man year, I never remember police be-
ing an issue. Now, if you fart, you are
thrown in handcuffs and begging for a
ﬁve minute phone call. Officer, you can
tow my car, but you can’t take my soul; I

don’t have one, I’m a ginger.

The school cracking down on frater-
nities seems to be the leading contributor
to decreased fun levels. Administration
says they want to move more parties on
campus, yet they still hand out ﬁnes for
a few stray beer cans lying around the
house. Contact hours for “new mem-
bers” has gone from 17 hours a day to 15
hours a day. To top it all off, pledgeship
for all fraternities will be six weeks in-
stead of eight weeks in the coming years.
With the strict punishments to fratemi-
ties and the recent disbanding of a lead-
ing chapter on campus, it is clear that the
university is cracking down.

Soon, parties off campus will be
scarce. Windfall Hill will be a residen-
tial neighborhood in 2-3 years, thus low-
ering Lexington’s fun levels by 30% (I

ran the numbers myself). Since partying

Danae performance provokes thought _

The Repertory Dance Company appeared last week in an emotional and artistic Show

By Janey Fugate
5 TA F F w R I T E R

Last week, the Repertoryv Dance
Company performed its biannual dance
show for faculty, parents, and the student
body. Rehearsing for an average of four
hours every night for two weeks before
the show, the dancers put forth one of the
highlight performances of the academic
year

According to the dance company’s
artistic director Jenefer Davies, the
show offered “a wide range of dance
types from contemporary modern dance,
cutting edge styles to more traditional
pieces.” The breadth and variety of the

dances was further diversiﬁed through
the eclectic music selection such as Alice
in Wonderland themed music, the more
obscure Icelandic artist Sigur Ros, to Si-
mon & Garfunkel.

The performances were not only
meant to entertain but also to provoke
thought and an emotional response from
the audience. For example, the ﬁrst
dance juxtaposed three slow, synchro-
nized dancers with two wiggling, ﬁdget-
ing dancers sitting to the side of them.
The dancers switch roles throughout the
piece, moving from very strict choreog-

raphy to a looser, strange state of impa-
tience.

Regarding this artistic goal to connect
with and engage the audience, ﬁrst-year
Mary Kamp said, “I liked the fact that
each dance had a story you had to ﬁg-
ure out — more interesting to follow. I
thought overall it was really beautiful.”

Perhaps one of the most memorable
dances of the show was “Veil of Igno-
rance.” In this piece Jennifer Ritter ’l3
and Jillian Katterhagan ’l5 performed
a slow, sexually charged dance in front
of a lava-like drape in which neither of

them ever stood completely upright.

Though many of the dances were
student choreographed, Davies choreo-
graphed this piece with very personal
interests and experiences _ in mind. “It
was a very emotionally rooted piece
for [Davies],” said Katterhagan, “which
made it an honor and a challenge to try.”
She described the experience of striving
to create one body with two dancers say-
ing, “It was a unique experience to be so
aware of another person while you were
dancing.”

For some of the dancers, this show

also functioned as a rehearsal for the
Dance Company’s trip to Scotland this
coming August. W&L is sending a
group of its most talented performers to
dance in the annual Fringe Festival — a
multicultural celebration of the visual
and performing arts held in Edinburgh.
There, the dancers will represent W&L
by performing several of the pieces they
exhibited last week.

Alum calls for a return to the earth

Alumna Alana DeJoseph went to Mali and came back with a new approach to nature and community

By Colleen Moore
5 TA F F w R IT E R

Conservationist and father of wildlife
management Aldo Leopold wrote “The
Sand County Almanac” in 1949, and it

. still serves as a timeless inspiration for

American environmentalists.
Washington and Lee University
alumna and cinema producer Alana
Deloseph ’92 helped create a tribute to
Leopold’s legacy with the ﬁlm “Green
Fire: Aldo Leopold‘ and a Land Ethic for

Our Time.”

Graduating in 1992 with degrees in
Theatre Arts and Business Administra-
tion, Deloseph began searching forjobs
in a time of high unemployment. Her de-
cision not to attend graduate school for
business did not help her prospects.

Her life outlook changed with a
course she took titled “Food, Population
and Poverty.”

“It was the ﬁrst glimpse I had that I
was part of something larger than my-
self,” said Deloseph. With the guidance
of a professor, Deloseph entered the
Peace Corps and was sent to Mali. There
she found that Malians had a more direct
connection with their environment and a
much stronger sense of their role in their
community.

Similar to the way Malians ap-

proached daily life, Leopold’s land ethic
asks us to see the natural world as a com-
munity to which we belong. Deloseph
said, “It is an ethic that requires us to
see beyond our species. The individual
is a member ofa community of different
parts.”

Today, Delospeh hopes Green Fire
can pass along Leopold’s land ethic to a
21*‘ century population.

“It is one of the crucial remedies to
connect everybody back to the land,”
she said. To embody nature in a way the
Malians did — seeing ourselves a part of
the whole that has a responsibility to the
larger community — is one way to ad-
dress the ecological challenges we are
facing today.

“It would be nice to recapture what
we used to have," said Deloseph.

Andrew Renaldo discusses upsets and how they affect the tournament

By Andrew Renaldo
STAF F WRITER

After a handful of upsets in the ﬁrst
round of NCAA tournament games,
the top teams have restored order head-
ing into the Final Four. While everyone
loves a good Cinderella story this time
of year, I am personally glad that the
best teams remain.

A crucial part of March Madness’s
allure is its unpredictability. The tour-
nament would be boring without a few
upsets, and winning it all would not
seem as signiﬁcant without a few re-
minders of elites’ vulnerability. I worry,
though, that there is a point at which
too many shockers diminishes the
quality of basketball.

Anyone who suffered through last
year’s national championship game can
understand my point. UConn won de-
spite scoring 19 points in the ﬁrst half,
outlasting a Butler team who lost two
crucial players from its fairy—tale sea-
son the previous year. Watching UCo-

nn’s Kemba Walker was always fun, but
it seemed anticlimactic to see them
beat a Butler team that did not seem to
have any business playing for a national
championship.

The difference between Butler’s 2011
and 2010 teams gets at my point: I like
Cinderella teams, but if they are going
to make a long run in the tournament,
I want to feel like they belong with the
best. Butler’s 2010 squad was versatile
and could contend with anyone in the
country. Their run to the title game was
somewhat improbable but still justiﬁ-
able. Had their best player, future NBA
player Gordon Heyward, made his tan-
talizingly close half-court heave (which
would have been the most memorable
shot in college basketball history, I’m
convinced), they would have been wor-
thy champions. '

The 2011 Butler team, in contrast,
was not the same caliber. Although

any run that deep into the tourna-
ment cannot be considered a ﬂuke, an
element of luck certainly aided Butler.
Most notably, they played VCU in the
Final Four. I have family in Richmond
and VCU’s run excited me, but I had a
hard time convincing myself they were
better than Kansas, their elite 8 oppo-
nent. Two upset specials led to Butler
vs. VCU in the Final Four. Despite its
charming novelty, this matchup could
have easily been a ﬁrst—round game. In
the end, too many upsets lead to un-
derwhelming games late in the tourna-
ment.

1 think teams in the tournament
ﬁeld are analogous to individual play-
ers on a team. Great teams often have
the quintessential “underrated” big
man who does all the dirty work—sets
screens, rebounds, takes charges, estab-
lishes a physical presence in the paint,
etc. Analysts love to point out this

Washington and Lee co—hosted the

schools from all three NCAA divisions
attended with over 1,200 athletes partici-
pating.

events of day two took place at VMI’s
Foster Staduim. The javelin was the lone

The winner of the women’s javelin
was senior- Lauren Butler from Allegh-
eny. She threw the javelin a meet record
distance of42.66m (l39’l1”).

The women’s javelin was just one of
many meet records that got broken over
the course of the two day meet. Athletes
broke an additional 13 meet records. A
full listing is below.

Multiple school records were also
broken over the weekend. The men’s

and women’s teams broke two records
apiece. V .

Sophomores Zander Tallman and
Dillon Myers broke the school 400 me-
ter and decathlon records, respectively.

Tallman ran a time of 47.66 breaking
not only the school recordbut the meet
record as well. It is also the fastest 400
meter time in Division III yet this sea-
son.

Myers scored a total of 6,480 points
in the decathlon to place second. Myers’

player, as it shows they appreciate the
ﬁner points of basketball. Eventually,
everyone praises this player so much
that he paradoxically becomes over-
rated for being underrated. He does
his job—and it’s an important one—but
when push comes to shove, he strug-
gles to score, does not have great ball-
handling skills, and is an abysmal free
throw shooter. Teams cannot win with
only these types of players; they need a
few stars too.

From this year’s tournament, Nor-
folk State and Lehigh are like these
underrated players. Their upsets over
Missouri and Duke, respectively, were
understandably fun for some people
to watch. They highlighted the talent
that can be found in mid-major con-
ferences, which the media tends to
overlook. Yet I do not doubt that Mis-
souri and Duke were better teams, and
their losses prevented fans from see-

ival

score was also good enough to beat the
previous meet record. Junior Antonio
Wood of VMI, the only competitor to
beat Myers with a score of 6,657 points,
is the new decathlon meet record holder.

On the women’s side, ﬁrst-year Jil-
lian Katterhagen was a part of two
school record-setting performances. On
Friday she broke the pole vault record

Women s tennis falls to two ranke opponents in Fab Five Invite

By Leigh Dannhauser
SPORTS EDITOR

Third-ranked Washington and Lee lost just
their fourth match of the outdoor‘ season to
fourth-ranked Emory on Saturday 5-2 during
the Fab Five Invitational hosted by W&L.

The match was moved inside to the Duch-
ossois Tennis Center due to the weather. Space
limitations of the facility led to the match ‘only
being played to ﬁve points.

W&L found themselves behind early ver-
sus Emory after losing two of three doubles
competitions.

The Generals lost the ﬁrst doubles compe-
tition but was able to tie it back up after win-
ning the number three game. First-year Patri-

cia Kirkland and sophomore Cameron Dorsey
teamed up to defeat ﬁrst-year Catharine Harris
and junior Jordan Wylie in the second com-
pleted doubles game.

The Generals lost the ﬁnal doubles com-
petition, the number two game, when sopho-
mores Malavik Padmanabhan and Brenna
Kelly of Emory defeated senior Lauren Lukas
and ﬁrst-year Meghan Buell of W&L.

W&L won just one of four singles compe-
titions. The lone victory came when ﬁrst-year
Allison Hupalo defeated ﬁrst-year Lauren
Pinsky in a tight contest. The game went to
a third set and after many tied scores, Hupalo

won the set 15-13 to win.

Earlier in the tournament the Generals
faced both ﬁrst-ranked Williams and seventh-
ranked Tufts.

The Generals lost to Williams 7-2 on
Wednesday, but defeated Tufts 6-3 the follow-
ing day. Before the weekend, the Generals had
won 12 matches in a row. They had not lost
since February 18”‘ when they faced James
Madison, a Division I program.

W&L returns to the court on Saturday
when they travel to Carnegie Mellon for a
12:00 p.m. match.

W&L’s Beautiﬁc tion Initiative

W&L Oﬁice of Admissions reveals the real reason all applicants are required to submit a headshot

ByCampbe|| Burr
OPINIONS EDITOR

On Sunday, the W&L Ofﬁce of Ad-
missions admitted to implementing a
“Beauty Initiative” four years ago. The
plot was uncovered after suspicion from
other top liberal arts and Ivy League
schools who realized that their incom-
ing students had the same achievement
levels as W&L’s, but were a lot less
attractive. W&L admissions officer,
Howie Looking, created the project after
W&L alums expressed concern that the
school’s increasingly competitive admis-
sions process would compromise the at-
tractiveness of the student body.

The “Beauty Initiative” requires all
applicants to submit a headshot along
with test scores, transcripts, and essays.
In addition to reviewing applicants’ aca-
demic achievements, ofﬁcers rank each
applicant from I to I0 on a “beauty
scale.” Though beauty rankings are not
weighed as highly as grade point aver-
age, admissions officers have admitted
that in the last two years, beauty rank-
ings have had as much weight as high
school extracurricular involvement in
some cases.

Yale admissions ofﬁcer, Anita May
Kover, led the investigation of W&L’s
admissions process. She hired an under-
cover detective to pose as a W&L student
fulﬁlling her work-study requirement at
the admissions oﬁﬁce. While “ﬁling,” the
detective found beauty scales inside each
applicant’s folder. She stole a few and
brought them to her boss. Kover emailed
the W&L admissions team, “We have

Sigma Chi revamps its

By Frances Everclear
STAFF WRITER

The popularity of the Hunger Games
series, which includes The Hunger
Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay,
has exploded on the Washington and Lee
campus, especially within the sorority
community. Deciding to capitalize on
the excitement surrounding the series,
Sigma Chi spent the winter giving a mas-
sive overhaul to their traditional week-
long charity event: starting this year, the
Derby Days will feature a ﬁght to the
death with one sorority ﬁrst-year
crowned Champion of the
Derby Games.

copies of your beauty scales. You’re
busted.”

The W&L team responded, almost
immediately. “We’re busted?'Hope you
put those beauty scales to use!”

Williams’ admissions officer, Hugh
lass, was asked to comment. He defend-
ed the Williams admissions process as
“need-blind and beauty-blind.” He con-
tinued, “We may not have the best look-
ing campus in the nation, but at least we
don’t have the shallowest.”

The W&L admissions team denied
accusations of having a “shallow” pro-
cess, claiming that students are happier
when they are surrounded by prettier
people. “At W&L, students’ happiness
is ﬁrst and foremost,” said May Beeshal-
low, a W&L admissions officer.

To avoid future trouble, the W&L ad-
missions team has decided to announce
all other “secret” initiatives in the works.
The team revealed that in coming years,
they may require applicants to ﬁll out an
additional form to determine whether
they would ﬁt in at W&L;

Washington & Lee University’s Ap-
plication for Admission, Part II would
request basic information, as well de-
tails regarding beer chugging and swing
dancing abilities, and political affiliation.

Even after the huge backlash, the
W&L admissions team has no intention
of doing away with the Beauty Initia-
tive. Ms. Beeshallow commented, “We
are satisﬁed with our process. We look
for students with a ‘good head on their

some of the details will remain closely
guarded secrets before the Games. The
event will start, much like the previ-
ous version, the ﬁrst Monday of Spring
Term. Four members of each sorority’s
pledge class will be chosen through
what is being called a “mutual selection
process.” First-years will be picked at
chapter meetings and provided a Sigma
Chi mentor to coach

them through

the pre-

uratively. The only adjust-
ment we’re considering is
giving the beauty rank-
ings more weight in the
admission decision.”

Games. The 24 sorority women will
represent their sorority in a pre-Games
public interview and pre-Games train-
ing before being put into the arena on
Wednesday afternoon. After the start of
the Games, Derby Days will become
a free-for-all; much like the original
Derby Days, rules that arise during the
Games are temporary or will be disre-
garded. Obstacles for the participants
are undetermined as of yet, but frater-
nity members have hinted that skills in
baking themed desserts, keg stands, and

handling greased waterrnelons would

be helpful to survival. Sigma Chi has
decided to keep upperclassmen and
members of other fraternities and
organizations involved by allow-
ing them to cheer on the side-
lines and send care packages
to the ﬁrst-years, which
may include anything
from lettered sweatbands
to emergency Redbulls.
The actions of the ﬁrst-
years will be covered

webcam feeds, and on

raised by entry fees and structured gam-
bling will be split between the winner’s
sorority’s national philanthropy and the
host’s beer fund.

The reaction to the new Days has
been decidedly mixed. In general, frater-
nity members have responded well to the
idea. “It’s just like the powderputf game
on steroids. I don’t see what everyone’s
getting so upset about,” reasoned junior
Peter Meriwether, while senior Gates
Harkness said, “Everyone loves watch-
ing it. Did you see the Kappa-KD game
last year? Sick, am I right?” Sophomore
Kathryn DeWitt agreed. “I loved Derby
Days last year! Plus, my sorority has the
best class of freshmen. Somebody we
pick is going to win. Ijust might vol-
unteer my little...she’s a champ. The
people complaining are just jealous
they didn’t join a sorority of winners.
Sorry ‘bout it.” F irst-year Ellery Spald-
ing, looking visibly upset about the an-
nouncement, expressed a much different
view. “I’m really nervous about the new
format. I love all the books, but I didn’t
think this would happen in real life. And
I was really looking forward to bond-
ing with my whole pledge class.” When
questioned if she would decline to par-

    
     

    

  
 

ticipate in the Derby Games, Spalding
said, “Well, obvs I’ll do it. It’s real death
or social death so...I guess real death
will be ﬁne.” Fellow ﬁrst-year Mary
Margaret Coleridge added, “I’ve been
training for this since February. I haven’t
eaten in, like, two days and I can still run
for miles without stopping. I hope I get
picked. Plus, you get wear to wear cute
tanks and Norts! Still, the whole dying
thing is kind of terrible. Whatever.”

The drastically altered format has
come under ﬁre from the Panhellenic
Council as well as school officials. Pan-
hel released a statement referring to the
restructuring as “detrimental to the spirit
of sisterhood” and “unfair to sororities
with smaller new active pledge sizes.”
One dean was quoted as saying, “How
were they able to clear this event in the
ﬁrst place? Surely this can’t be legal?”

A representative for Sigma Chi re-
sponded to the controversy with, “The
Games will be regulated by Sigma Chi
brothers to ensure the utmost level of
fairness and respect between competi-
tors. Good luck to all ﬁrst-years, and
may the odds be ever in your favor. Kid-
ding. You’re all screwed.”

Unemployment’: the ﬁnal solution

Economies Professor introduced lz

By Ernesto Superbius, Ph.D.
G U E s T w R IT E R

Ernesto Superbius received his Ph.D.
in 1985 from the University of Santiago
in Chile. Upon graduation, General Au-
gusto Pinochet and Prof. Milton Fried-
man personally bestowed upon him the
coveted Von Mises Prize in Economics
for his dissertation on “The Enforcement
of Free Markets.” Now a U.S. citizen,
Dr. Superbius holds the Ronald Reagan
Chair in Advanced Economic Theory
and Remedial Arithmetic at Northern
South Dakota Community College. He
recently gave the following lecture at a
joint meeting of the Lexington Libertar-
ian League and the local chapter of Mor-
mons and Evangelicals United for Big
Business, Small Government and Vari-
ous Wedge Issue.

According to the New York Times,
the electronics giant, Apple, has cre-
ated 700,000 manufacturing jobs in
China and other foreign countries, but
only 43,000 here at home. Just before
he died, Steve Jobs bluntly told Presi-
dent Obama that the positions Apple has
moved to China will NEVER return to
America. Another Apple executive add-
ed “We don’t have an obligation to solve
America’s problems.”

From ’my own libertarian perspective,
I think Apple has it right. By having no
obligations to America, the company
made over $108 billion last year—more

- than the budgets of the states of Michi-

gan, New Jersey and Massachusetts put
together. The company’s CEO took
home $427 million in company stock-
-in addition to his $1.7 million salary.
Not a bad Apple!

Like Apple executives, we liber-
tarians don’t have to solve America’s
problems either—unless, of course, they
get out of hand. Mitt Romney recently
said he’s not worried about the poor. He
clearly was thinking of Marx’s Lumpen-
proletariat, the low-class parasites that
live on charity, disability payments and
food stamps. If that’s what he had in
mind, Romney is absolutely right. Our
Lord Himself said we would always
have the poor among us. (He obviously
had in mind the malodorous defectives
who hang out in the restrooms of Grey-
hound bus stations and public libraries.
You’ll never get rid of all of them--not
“even with buekshot,” as we say out
West). = .

What we libertarians and Mormons-
and-Evangelicals-United SHOULD
worry about is the unemployment of the
SUPRA-lumpens, the stratum one level
above the parasites. Why? Because
these people, the cream of the proletari-
at, VOTE! And we want those votes to
support our big business-small govem-

ment agenda.

What we need today is a FINAL SO-
LUTION to unemployment of the supra-
lumpens. In their wisdom, America’s
ﬁnancial leaders have sold off the better
part of our manufacturingbase to China
and other countries~something the elite
of other countries would never DREAM
of doing. We have DARED to move
into the post-industrial age. You have
to admit that that took REAL GUTS
and REAL COMMITMENT to
FREE TRADE! Our leaders
must now be equally gutsy about
solving the resulting problem of
post-industrial unemployment.

Unlike de facto unemploy-
ment, STRUCTURAL UNEM-
PLOYMENT is something
that demands the libertar-
ian’s attention. I am con-
vinced that we can bring

and CONSISTENCY
to this problem that we
have brought the na-
tion’s other social and
moral issues. We just
have to stick to our AB-
SOLUTE ECONOMIC
PRINCIPLES.

According to the
economic theory "of
“comparative advan-
tage,” countries that
want to prosper from in-
ternational trade should
do what they’re really
good at. But what IS
the United States good
at now ‘that we‘ have
given up manufactur-
ing?

The answeris staring
us in the face: WAR, or,
if you like, KEEPING
THE PEACE. Every-
one knows that the U.S.
has the most powerful

military machine in the world. Every
year, we spend roughly $680 billion on
defense, more than the military budgets
of the next ten nations combined. We
have between 900 to 1,100 bases in
foreign lands, outposts that cover some
29,819,492 (rented) acres. Writing in
the “Asia Times,” Nick Turse says that
“the US military maintains an empire of
bases so large and shadowy that no one-
-NOT EVEN AT THE PENTAGON--re-
ally knows its full size and scope.” This
huge investment makes it possible for us
to ﬁght two or three wars whenever and
wherever we please.

Instead of just SPENDING money
on defense, why not use the military to
MAKE money—AND SIMULTANE-
OUSLY SOLVE THE NATION’S UN-
EMPLOYMENT PROBLEM? Here’s
what I propose: Let’s turn the U.S. mili-
tary into the world’s largest, most lethal
MERCENARY FORCE. Yes, let’s rent
out our troops to countries around the
world—and make war proﬁtable for a
change.

In the American Revolution, the Brit-
ish rented 30,000 Hessian soldiers from
Landgrave Frederick 11 of Hesse-Kassel.
This was a win-win situation for every-
one. It saved gallons of British blood
and poured thousands of golden ducats
into the coffers of the German princes.
What were the British doing? They were
OUTSOURCING their war in America-
-just what we did when we hired Black-
water and other private contractors to
help us out in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Unfortunately, political correct-
ness and pseudo-patriotism blind some
people to the UTILITY of mercenary
warfare. Most of our recent wars have
resulted in a horriﬁc loss of blood, trea-
sure and national reputation. It’s time
to let someone else call the shots. At
least then we won’t be blamed for cost-
overruns, friendly-ﬁre, lost battles and
other screw-ups. My mercenariﬁcation
program will transform the army into a
LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY that
will create a much-needed ZONE OF
IMMUNITY around our military and
political leaders.

Here are some mercenariﬁcation’s
other pluses: ’

Mercenary warfare doesn’t have to
be “just.” Once Congress adopts my
plan, a “just war” will become just a
war. Those of you who know something
about the history of economic develop-
ment know that the same thing happened
to the medieval idea of the “just price.”
In today’s capitalist world, a “just price”
is just a price. Thanks to mercenariﬁca-
tion, the old idea of “causus belli” will
be relegated to the history of theology.
Once our mercenaries hit the road all we
have to do is collect the rent!

Like all economists--from Adam
Smith to my own dear teacher, Milton
Friedman--I worry a lot about monopo-
lies. Because a monopoly, by deﬁnition,
is a business with no competition, it is
inefficient and inﬂationary. A

“natural mo-

nopoly,” on the other hand, is some-
thing else. Take your public utilities. It
would be counterproductive to have two
or three electric, gas, water, or sewage
treatment companies serving the same
city. So we choose just one and grant
it a monopoly over a speciﬁc service.
Your local police force is good example.
You wouldn’t want Lexington to have
two or three police departments just so
they could “compete” with each other.
Because competing police forces would
invite corruption and even bloodshed,
they wouldn’t bring costs down. Just
imagine a shoot-out in downtown Lex-
ington between competing police units!
For the same reason, we wouldn’t want
to have competing national armies. We
don’t need THAT kind of “competi-
tion!”

Since the military is a natural mo-
nopolyﬂone that the government must
have and pay for in any case--WHY
NOT MAKE IT AS PROFITABLE AS
YOUR LOCAL SEWAGE DEPART-
MENT?

Many cities are already outsourcing
jobs and applying free-market models
to government. Your city manager, for

(Mubarak didn’t have any oil money to
spend on mercenaries,.but a savvy U.S.
administration could have pried the Suez
Canal away from him in return for a few
battalions).

The much-maligned DICK CHENEY
was actually onto something when he
predicted that, once we had our hands on
the spigots of Iraqi oil, the war against
Saddam Hussein would pay for itself.
Unfortunately, the liberal, nice-guy
Obama administration forgot to send
Nouri al-Maliki’s government the bill!
That’s why we’re still out the $1 trillion
we spent on that war (not to mention the
$9 billion unaccounted for, and the $6.6
billion that was stolen).

TRUTH BE TOLD, CHENEY
DIDN’T GO FAR ENOUGH. We need
wars that not only pay for themselves;
we need ones that will turn a proﬁt. True,
the government would have to put some
“seed money” into mercenariﬁcation.
But doesn’t China subsidize its state-
owned industries? Didn’t Japan and the
“Asian Tigers” do the same thing‘? And
just look how well they are doing!

Critics worry that mercenariﬁca-
tion will result in a high toll in human

example, is a good example ofoutsourc-
ing. He is simply a private contractor
paid to do what mayors and other elected
ofﬁcials are supposed to do. The wide-
spread use of city managers makes the
astute libertarian wonder why the rest of
government can’t be outsourced. Elimi-
nating elected positions makes perfect
economic sense. It would maximize ef-
ﬁciency, cut government spending and
expand the private sector.

State universities show how public
institutions can'be used to attract foreign
capital. In recent years, state legislatures
have slashed university budgets by more
than a half. Some have cut back admis-
sions to in-state residents in order to ad-
mit more foreign students whose tuition
is often THREE TIMES HIGHER than
that of in-state students. Some foreign
students even pay an annual surcharge
of up to $2,500. Every year, these
students add some $21 billion to our
economy. If the Grand Poobahs of the
Chinese Communist Party are willing
to pay this much to educate their kids,
think what they would pay to put down a
political uprising! Beleaguered leaders
like Syria’s Bashar al-Assad would be
delighted to rent the Marines for a few

weeks. Muammar Gaddaﬁ, Slobodan
Milosevicand Hosni Mubarak ended

life, that the public will sour on the idea
when the body bags start to come home,
or that people will treat returning veter-
ans poorly.

These objections must be handled
with great sensitivity--but with hard
heads too.

The answers can be found in con-
temporary attitudes toward the military.
Civilians no longer look at soldiers the
way they did years ago in the days of the
draft. In effect, the all-volunteer army
has lifted an enormous burden from the
shoulders of the public. No longer do
we have to fret about veterans’ personal
lives—their post-warjoblessness, home-
lessness,_drug-addictions, post-traumatic
stress syndromes, amputations, suicides,
criminality and sexual perversions. To
put it blunt1y~and we libertarians are as
BLUNT as we are CONSISTENTI--the
responsibility for what happens to sol-
diers has ALREADY BEEN SHIFTED
TO THEIR OWN SHOULDERS.

Think about it! Under mercenariﬁca-
tion, no one will be compelled to enlist.
Mercenaries will sign up because they
want the excitement of ‘foreign travel,
as well as the training, pay and respect
that come from wearing the/U.S. uni-
form. They are the ones who want the

 

is solution to unemployment and American defense spending in his lecture last Friday

ones who will be signing the service
contract--not your average tax-payer!
As everyone knows, A CONTRACT IS
A CONTRACT.

So who IS responsible for what hap-
pens to the soldier? THE SOLDIER
HIMSELF! We’re talking here about
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY-
-something that all of us libertarians,
conservatives, Mormons and Evangeli-
cals ﬁrmly believe in. This is what made
America great. Taking personal respon-
sibility for our lives is the ONLY way
out of the economic morass created by
our liberal past!

I predict that as our mercenaries be-
gin deploying abroad, the unemployed
will enlist in droves. I also predict that
the mercenaries will have a “multiplier
effect” on the whole economy. Taxes
will come down and incomes will go
up. The middle class, now threatened
by Obama’s paciﬁsm, will ﬂourish once
again. As the business picks up, tax
revenues will pour into the Treasury-
-just as gold poured into the coffers of
those Hessian princes during the Ameri-
can Revolution. The wimps now"call-
ing for cuts in defense spending will
be silenced once’ and for all. Liberal
tax-hikers will be stopped dead in their
tracks. Gratuitous amenities like Social
Security, Medicare and Medicaid can
be dismantled. School teachers can be
rehired--even the music teachers. State
parks that were closed during the Great
Recession will be reopened (and then,
hopefully, privatized). The national
debt will not only shrink; I predict it
will disappear altogether. Since foreign
countries will be relying on U.S. forces
to maintain law and order, military bud-
gets around the world will shrink. This,
in turn, will result in greater global sta-
bility and higher proﬁt margins for all.
In short, mercenariﬁcation will result in
what President Ronald Reagan called
“moming in America.” Indeed, the sun
will rise on the whole world!

There’s nothing wrong with being
the world’s cop--if, like doctors, you’re
paid on a fee-for-service basis. But to
police the world without being paid at
a11~THAT’S SHEER MADNESS!

If mercenariﬁcation is NOT adopted,
I’d like to know how we are going to
pay for the world’s most expensive mili-
tary, the world’s most costly health sys-
tem, Social Security and the rest of our
socialist system? What are we going to
do about the national debt? How can we
pay for these things with the paltry tax
revenues generated by the low wages
and chronic unemployment of our new,
post-industrial economy?

It’s high time we conservatives, lib-
ertarians and members of Mormons-
and-Evangelicals-United all started to
think‘ about these things. If we don’t,
the liberals, socialists and fascists will
use them as grist for their own

gov- ernment to pay for their dark, sa- tanic mills. And

Featured author Colum McCann discusses how the voices of Tom Wolfe and many others have inﬂuenced his writing

By Tommy Kent
5 TA F F w R I T E R

The 9th Annual Tom Wolfe Week-
end Seminar, sponsored by the Class of
1951, brought alumni back to Washing-
ton and Lee for a weekend ﬁlled with
literary discussion. This year the event
featured the author Colum McCann who
discussed his award-winning novel Let
the Great World Spin.

For the opening event, Colum Mc- ‘

Cann gave a lecture in Lee Chapel en-
titled “The Art of Knowing the World
through Fiction.” Wolfe, in introducing
McCann, said, “[The weekend seminar]
really is a great honor. I’m trying to think
of a word ‘for it... posthumous. It makes
me feel posthumous.”

While speaking of the merits of Mc-
Cann’s writing, Wolfe said, “I want to sit
down with [McCann] after this and learn
about all of his reporting techniques. I
was spell bound and greatly surprised.
If there is anyone who hasn’t read Let
the Great World Spin, you are in for a
marvelous time.”

McCann followed Wolfe and began
his lecture by describing his childhood
and how he came to be a writer. Mc-

Cann said: “So much of everything goes
back to our fathers. My dad was a news-

~ paper editor in Dublin. He used to come

home with books.” These books, includ-
ing those written by Wolfe, inspired Mc-
Cann to experiment with reporting.
McCann said, “As a teenager I knew
somehow that [Wolfe] in particular was
shifting my world view sideways.” He
cited Wolfe’s Bonﬁre of the Vanities as
a specific inﬂuence. “We get our voice

from the voices of others. So much of ‘

my voice has come from the great Tom
Wolfe and my father and other authors,”
said McCann.

Relay raises

Students, faculty and members of the Lexington community
walked in the ﬁght against cancer at Relay for Life this weekend
at the Canaan Green. The 394 participants at the event helped

...generate $_l5,l 19'for the American Cancer Society.

Nineteen teams of organizations on campus, including fac-
ulty departments, clubs, fraternities and sororities, raised money

by soliciting donations and setting up food stands and activities

at the  V

 three tearns atthe event were Pi Beta Phi, raising
.-;s,2,49y9,. Keeping HOPE Alive, raising $2,119 and Sigma Nu,
 isirfg $1,907,. Top participants were Robert Uhlman from Sig-
 Nu aI1d‘Ch,ristina and Chuck Winschel from Keeping HOPE

 event lasted from 5:30 p.m. on Friday until 5:45 a.m. ..
I on Saturday and included Zumba activities,‘ rafﬂes, children’s‘
 activities, a Professor shaved head contest won by Mathemat-
 S Professor, Carrie Finch, inﬂatable slides and pillow bashes,
M11sicand' performances by General Admissions, Southern
‘fort, Jubilee, Drew Martin an'd‘the_ Limelights, Washing-

  

  
    
   
 

es and “The Gatehouse.”

The; event also included the tradition of lighting luminaries at
. ,  in honor of loved ones who lost their lives to cancer and
‘hope for those continuing to battle cancer. L

McCann added: “It seemed to me that
the art of knowing the world was not
only in the art of telling, but in the art of
imagining. I began to realize at an early
age that creative reading isjust as impor-
tant as creative writing.”

In a gesture toward Tom‘Wolfe, M'c-
Cann said, “We are an accumulation of
voices. I would not be here but for the
generosity of this gentleman here.”

McCann emphasized the importance
of experimenting with writing and tak-
ing on obscure characters. McCann, in
describing the writing process, quoted
Kurt Vonnegut, who said, “You should
be continuing to jump off cliffs and de-
veloping wings on the way down.”

McCann. said: “I’m somewhat sick
of the world. We need stories. Stories
create what is yet to come. Literature
proposes possibilities and then makes
truth of them. In literature, we are given
evidence of being alive. It is a moral ar-
gument for living in the world and for a
sustained imagination at the same time.”

Returning to the democracy of voices
message, McCann said, “When we en-
ter a story
we enter out
most stun-
ning de1noc-
racy. Every-
body has a
story. Every-
body has a
deep need to
tell a story.”

Since Mc-
Cann cited
his happy
chﬂdhood
as the worst
possible
thing that a
writer could
want, he has
attempted to
live his life
on the edge,
similar to
Wolfe’s rep-
resentation of “leaving the study.”

He has spent months living with the
homeless and working withjuvenile de-
linquents. Inspired by Wolfe’s The Elec-
tric Kool-Aid Acid Test, McCann sug-
gested to his friends that they take a bus
across America when he was in college.
McCann’s friends were all for it, but due
to worrying mothers and other obstacles,

' most of them couldn’t take the trip. Mc-

Cann said, “It went from a bus, to a van,
to a bicycle,” riding 1200 miles across
the U.S. for more than a year.

McCann said: “I had to learn to be at
that edge. In the course of the [the'jour-

.7  - ""}"§.’-“*??*'i‘*‘..

ney], I began to understand the idea of
the democracy of others. The act of get-
ting to know the real world is the art of
losing oneself. It makes me feel acutely
alive.” ’

McCann added: “You don’t write
what you know. You write towards what
you want to know. Tom Wolfe has done
this majestically. You learn things that
you knew but that you weren’t entirely
conscious of in the ﬁrst place. We all
have access to it. When we read a book
we empathize with characters. You can
cry and laugh, and the wonderful thing is
that you can wake up without any scars.”

Later in the speech, McCann shifted
to describe the background behind his
novel, Let the Great World Spin. Mc-
Cann, who has dual Irish and American
citizenship, lives in New York City and
was there when the planes crashed into
the Twin Towers.

On September 11, 2001, McCann’s
father was in one of the towers but was
able to get out. When McCann’s fa-
ther returned home, McCann’s young
daughter saw him. and told McCann,
“He’s burning.” McCann at ﬁrst thought
she meant that his clothes smelled like
smoke until she said, “'He’s burning from
the inside out.” McCann said that it was
at this point that he knew it would be his
job to write a story about 9/1 I.

Let the Great World Spin combines
the “image of creation” of Philippe Petite
walking aitightrope between the Twin
Towers on August 7, 1974, and the im-
age of destruction that is 9/1 I. McCann
said that he wanted to use the tightrope
walk as a sustained image in the novel.

“lfl could do it properly, maybe it
could be about who we are. I was tak-
ing this non-ﬁction event and manipulat-
ing it, just like I did when I was a boy. I
wanted to write about the symphony of
the city,” said McCann.

McCann read three passages from his
novel throughout his speech. From one
passage, he read:“We are all torn be-
tween the promise of doom and the dis-
appointment of the ordinary. We all live
on a tightrope.”

In the novel, McCann’s list of char-
acters includes prostitutes and an Irish
monk. McCann said he enjoys taking up
the lives of his characters. He said: “I
don’t really want to be myself. I wake up
in the morning and look at myself in the
mirror and say do I really have to spend
24 hours with this guy. It is so much fun
to roll away and be other.”

McCann said: “The beauty of lit-

’erature, like Joyce’s Ulysses, like ev-

erything I learned from my father, is its
ability to last. Fiction doesn’t lie. Fiction
shapes things. Literature reveals truth.

1-: -x-.--_-v..-A

Imagined comes from real, and real is
shaped by imagined.”

In application to writing, McCann
said:' “There is a degraded discourse
around ideas of literature and optimism.
I believe we have to go through the dark
to recognize the light. The best optimist
should be a cynic ﬁrst.”

The speech ended and several ques-
tions were asked before those regis-
tered for the seminar weekend departed
to attend the reception outside the Lee
House, followed by dinner in Evans
Dining Hall. The weekend continued on
Saturday morning with breakfast in the
Commons, discussion by W&L English
professor Marc Connor and Sociology
professor John Eastwood in Stackhouse
Theater, 21 book signing and ﬁnally lunch

, in the Lenfest Center lobby.

Professor Connor, speaking of Let
the Great World Spin, said during his
lecture, “The main character in the book
is the city itself, like Ulysses. Time and
history unify. McCann gives expression
to the things that go on beneath the sur-
face.”

Connor, described as the “best lectur-
er at Washington and Lee,” drew com-
parisons between Ralph Ellison and Mc-
Cann’s novel. Connor mentioned how
one ofthe characters in the novel makes
God into a human foe, but that the theol-
ogy of the novel is the opposite: God is
the mystery.

Professor Eastwood described mod-
ernization, our age-segregated society
and how it gives the sense of disconnec-
tion from each other. Eastwood said that
as a sociologist he sees connections that
are hidden from view and that McCann
really exposes this concept in the novel.

Eastwood said, “People experience
535   iii

themselves as disconnected and yet we
are all very closely connected.” "East-
wood mentioned social network charts,
which show the aggregate data of ties
between people, stating that happiness,
depression, political attitudes, religiosity
and obesity in one person increase the
chance of such characteristics in the next
connection. "

Eastwood, linking his speech to the
novel, said, “The vision of people cross-
ing paths does not seem so fantastical,
but seems to mirror reality. Emergent
forms of connectivity in social science
dovetail what the novel does.” Eastwood,
stating that he has no knowledge of the
aesthetics of the novel, said, “Novel and
sociology may be twins but they are not
identical twins.”

After the two professors concluded
their presentations, McCann joined them
to form a question and answer panel. At
one point, a person in attendance asked
how McCann discovered his characters.

McCann said, “I like the idea of the
novelist as an explorer. You set out in
a boat and you have no idea where you
are going. Many times you might ship-
wreck, or head right back to shore with
the wind. But sometimes you find a
Galapagos, full ofa diversity of charac-
ters.”

At the end of the panel, Wolfe, who
was in attendance for all of the week-
end’s events, said, “This has been an
extraordinary weekend. [Professor Con-
nor’s] address was peerless. So Colum,
you should be floating away from here.
You don’t even have to catch a plane.
God bless you all.”

Greek review: Fraternities from a female perspective

Fraternity stereotypes taken to a new level. Ladies and gentlemen, an introduction to the brotlzerlzoods at W&L

By Georgia Robgrtson
c o LU M N I ST

Whether or not you are a part of the
large percentage of the Washington &
Lee community directly involved with
Greek life, you are bound to attend at
least a few fraternity parties during your
four years at this school. With sixteen
different fraternities, there are unique
traits you can ﬁnd within each brother-
hood. So, in Greek alphabetical order, I
present an uncensored female perspec-
tive on all IFC fraternities on campus.

Beta Theta Pi

Frat House Location: Red Square

Off Campus Assets: Pole 1, County
Seat '

Big Parties: Das Klub '

Review: Beta takes brotherhood to
a whole new level. Described as being
“one huge bromance,” they deﬁnitely
take interest in their own. While they
tend to be in emotional relationships with
their fraternity brothers, Betas are gener-
ally nice guys who can hold their own
at a party. They have good cocktail par-
ties on big weekends and welcome pret-
ty much everyone to their parties. They
also give off somewhat of an athletic

vibe with a signiﬁcant amount of basket-
ball and soccer players, as well as repre-
sentation from a few other sports teams.
While they don’t host too many big an-
nual parties, Das Klub is a must and is

pulled off nicely year -after year. While
there are a fair share of jerks in any frat,
Beta seems to keep a low concentration
while.stiIl maintaining fun party guys
who aren’t overly cocky, weird or nerdy.

Chi Psi ‘

Frat House Location: Behind the
BDG Quad

Off Campus Assets: None

Big Parties: Late Night

Review: As a freshman, you are gen-
erally warned to steer clear of Chi Psi,
especially their infamous late night. And
while anonymity may be their biggest
adversary in the social ladder, they sure
can throw one hell of a party where shit
is always guaranteed to get weird. The
fraternity is making a decent comeback
from near extinction but still tends to
send out creepy vibes. Their house is
in the most convenient location since
it’s essentially on campus, making Late
Night all the more accessible. The truth
about Late Night is this: ifyou’re trying
to get weird, you’re going to go, and so
everyone there is down for a good time.
lt’s generally a crazy blackout experi-

ence since I’m positive no one wants
to go there sober. Chi Psi draws crowds
from every nook and cranny of campus.

KA is often not considered among the
infamous “Big 3” fraternities, although
they always seem to be knocking on
the door. While each pledge class has a
handful of Phi Kap/Phi Delt/SAE rejects,
they tend to be your typical meathead-
athlete frat bros. Don’t be fooled by their
lack of country houses, their big draw
parties are always in their basement with
a great band and a gazillion people. As
one student put it, “You are guaranteed
to make out with at least one person at
their parties — although it may be a town-

ness. Having admitted looks is a factor
in their rush process, it’s no surprise that
they generally house most of the heart-
throbs from each grade. They’re another
athletic frat with representatives from
baseball, basketball and football. Their
pledge class this year was deﬁnitely on
the small side, but as long as they don’t
repeat that next year it shouldn’t be a

. real factor. While the Sweet Delts tend to

come off as complete assholes, generally
speaking they are actually nice guys — if
you can get them away from their pledge
class.

Phi Gamma Delta ,

Frat House Location: Jackson Ave
(block behind Post Ofﬁce)

-They don’t throw any particularly mem-

orable parties and tend to have a handful
of hard drug users in every pledge class,
but are generally good for a hang out.
They have a lot of big guys since they
draw from both football boys KA didn’t
want and rugby. Into J a Rule.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon

Frat House Location: Davidson Park

Off Campus Assets: Hooterville,
Most of Windfall Hill

Big Parties: Toga Party, Paddy Mur-
phy’s, Tequilaville ‘

Review: SAE will hold a pennanent
spot in the Big 3 because they are always
able to ﬁll a pledge class with attractive,
well-off, southern guys — a triple threat

ie or a Veemee”. While
some of them are the
aggressive/predator
type at parties and
they are certainly not
shy about taking you
upstairs for a “tour,” a
decent amount of their fraternity consists
of genuine guys that know how to have
a good time - although they tend to lack
the ability to sweet talk
girls. Also, their fonnal is
Old South. Enough said.

Kappa Sigma

Frat House Location:
Davidson Park

Off Campus
None

Big Parties: Basement
Parties

Review: Luckily for
Kappa Sig, Phi Kap got
kicked off last year and
their fraternity lived to
see another pledge class.
Rumor has it the founding
members and new pledge
class have tried to mesh
but with little to no success
since they are essentially
polar opposites. No great
off-campus houses yet
since they’re still up and
coming, but a would-be-
Phi Kap pledge class is a
promising sign for the fratemity’s social
future. They’ve had a few basement par-
ties this year, which have been success-
ful and met with positive reviews from

Assets:

. girls. However, if they do end up being

the next Phi Kap, the stereotypical ass-
hole lax bro will still have a place to call
home. Joy.

Lambda Chi Alpha

Frat House Location: Davidson Park

Off Campus Assets: Old House

Big Parties: O-Week Old House,
Tropical

Review: Every freshman starts their
W&L career at Old House. lt’s the ﬁrst
off-campus (even though it’s basically
on campus) house that every freshman
can name, know the frat and be able to
navigate to within a week. While they’re
deﬁnitely not at the top of the food chain,
they are really nice, smart guys who
genuinely want you to have fun at their
parties. They’re deﬁnitely host to a large
number of guys with political aspira-
tions, and while some describe them as
nerdy, that’s the extent of bad comments
associated with Lambda. Tropical is by
far their biggest party and always turns
out an absurd goldﬁsh-hungry crowd,
but as the year goes on they don’t follow
through with on-par parties and become
socially indifferent. Although I hear Old
House is always welcome to host those
wanting to party.

Phi Delta Theta

Frat House Location: Red Square

Off Campus Assets: Pumptown, Hog-
back

Big Parties: Jell-O Wrestling, Hal-
loween (Real and Phi Delt)

Review: If you’re looking for a good
party, Phi Delt is usually a fair bet. And
luckily what they lack in the nice guy de-
partment they make up for in attractive-

If you ’re trying to get Weird, you ’re going to go, and
so everyone there is down for a good time.

Off Campus Assets: Sloop

Big Parties: Fiji Islands, Dirty Jersey

Review: Fiji by far has the nicest fra-
ternity house, although it’s underutilized
because it’s off by itself and they don’t
throw any big or memorable parties.
Largely composed of cross country run-
ners and Phi Psi rejects, they are deﬁnite-
ly quirky to the point of bizarre but are
sincerely sweet guys ‘that just don’t get
the social scene at W&L. They deﬁnitely
house their fair share of exceptions, but
for the most part aren’t much to write
home about. Although they don’t have
any big country houses or yearly par-
ties, you can always manage to have a
good time and meet a few nice guys you
wouldn’t have otherwise.

Phi Kappa Psi

Frat House Location: Davidson Park

Off Campus Assets: Cabins, Bush-
wood

Big Parties: Rave, Phi Psi-cadellic

Review: Easily most-improved af-
ter this year’s rush since they got a big
pledge class composed of great guys.
Generally throw good parties and are
easy to talk to and fun to hang out with,
but even their biggest parties of the year
are average at best. Another big draw
back is the amount of petty drama with-
in the fraternity. Still, you will be hard
pressed to ﬁnd a socially awkward ‘Phi
Psi, and if they keep their formal at the
Greenbrier, they are sure to continue
moving up in the ranks.

Pi Kappa Alpha

Frat House Location: Red Square

Off Campus Assets: 9 Tucker

Big Parties: Brights & Tights

Review: PiKA is one of the few fra-
ternities on campus that is hard to stereo-
type. There is deﬁnitely a faction within
the frat of nice, fun guys who just hap-
pen to either.be a little weird or friends
with people who are a little weird. But
an even larger amount of them tend to
be losers who think they are much cooler
than they actually are. With little to no

respect for girls and a drug-related disci- I

plinary past, PiKA is quickly becoming
socially irrelevant. For the handful of de-
cent guys, I’m sorry to lump you in with
the rest since you are worth thirty times
over the collective worth of the rest of
your fraternity.

Pi Kappa Phi

Frat House Location: Davidson Park

Off Campus Assets: Landing Strip

Big Parties: Face Fuck, Bombass

Review: Pi Phi is sort ofa misﬁt mix,
but it strangely "works heavily in their fa-
vor. On nice days you almost always see
them out on their lawn playing corn hole
and just day chayin’ the day away wheth-
er it’s a Tuesday or a Friday afternoon.
They are chill, easygoing guys who are
a blast to hang out with and get to know
without any pressure which stems from
their enthusiasm surrounding drinking
games, such as thunderstruck, which are
easily inclusive and great icebreakers.

almost no girl is im-
mune to. They project
a social elitist attitude
that is either genuine
or a front for their inse-
curities. However, they
throw good parties and
will always be considered “cool”. One
last thing: Coke.

Sigma Chi

Frat House Location: Davidson Park

Off Campus Assets: Cabins, Pole 3

Big Parties: MTV Grind, Filthy Rich,
Derby Days

Review: Although in recent years
their numbers have signiﬁcantly de-
clined, believe it or not, Sigma Chi used
to be a good fraternity. Luckily with
consistently good annual parties and the
tradition of Derby Days they probably
aren’t in danger of extinction, especially
since the guys they do have generally
know how to have a good time. This year
has solidiﬁed their social downturn, and
while Pole 3 parties used to always guar-
antee a fun night, they are now just a sad
turnout of girlfriends and groupies.

Sigma Nu

Frat House Location: Red Square

Off Campus Assets: Wasteland

Big Parties: Shipwreck

Review: SNu is your typical nerdy
nice guy frat. They are in no sense of the
word “bros,” for better or worse. They
put a lot of effort into mixers, which is
always appreciated, and are always ap-
proachable and talkative. Every girl
loves to be treated like a princess, and
at SNu you will.be treated like a queen.
Shipwreck is a fun party and they are
deﬁnitely working towards having a few
more big mixers to draw crowds. You
will also always, without a doubt, ﬁnd
the best drinks here.

Sigma Phi Epsilon

Frat House Location: Davidson Park

Off Campus Assets: None

Big Parties: Paint Party

Review: One Question: What the
ﬁick‘? I honestly could name probably
two Sig Eps and have never attended
or known someone who has attended
a party. Probably nice guys, if you can
meet one.

“Skull Society”

Frat House Location: N/A

Off Campus Assets: Pole 4, River
House, Downwind

Big Parties: Miami Vice

Review: Stereotypical frat/lax star.
Skulls are full of themselves, but not
without reason. Although they are
mostly huge douche bags, they are in-
telligently witty and have an uncanny
ability to entertain. They have a multi-
tude of “-isms,” which allows them to
make fun of people to their face without
them knowing. They also have a strong
preference for anything that is “dank.”

-Although not oﬁicially recognized by

the school (or anyone not in the society
itself), they are extremely dedicated to
advertising themselves i.e. turning off
the lights and music at every party and
chanting “skulls” for an uncomfortable
amount of time. Really only two words
come to mind: Douche. Bag.

_YC)L(): Thank you, Drake

Is an important message becoming a joke? Persons suggests taking Drake is motto to heart and living life to the fullest

“Tell me.
what is it you
plan to do with
your one wild
and precious
/ife?”-Mary
Oliver

“You only
, live once, that ’s

ting on the

Every day, every day, f—-k what any-
body say

Yolo. “You only live once.” This
phrase, coined by Drake in his recent
song, “The Motto,” has become a com-
mon vernacular phrase almost overnight.
And why shouldn’t it? “Yolo” is essen-
tially just another version of the cliche

By Annie Persons
co LU M N I ST

that urges one to live their lives to the
fullest, because “each day is a gift, that’s
why they call it ‘the present,” and “you
never know if today could be your last.”
These phrases are cliches for a reason,
too—-despite sounding trite and over-
used, it is true that we as humans have
no real control over our ultimate living
or dying. . .so why not live life to the full-
est while you can?

What is disturbing is that rather than
be simply added to the vault of afore-
mentioned cliches, the phrase “Yolo”
has become almost a joke in youth cul-
ture. For example, the other day I was at
a party and overheard a friend wonder-
ing if she should take one more shot...
the response of the person next to her
was “Do it, YOLO!!”...I, for one, am
a proponent of living life to the fullest,
don’t get me wrong, but where does one
draw the line between living vivaciously
and living recklessly? Likewise, there is
even a twitter account now in existence
called simply @YOLOjokes. Examples
of tweets include “reenacting the titanic
scene with rose and jack in a bathtub.

#YOLO” and “trick or treating even
though it’s not Halloween #YOLO.”
While these tweets are certainly intended
as jokes, if someone wants to do some-

thing silly that would perhaps break a so- ~

cial nomi, why shouldn’t they? IfI want
to wear a fanny pack out to a frat party
(seriously though, why did those things
go out of style?) why should I let fear
of judgment by people I honestly don’t
know or care about, or even people I do,
affect me? Yolo has become a sarcas-

_ tic phrase tacked onto the proposal that

someone do something stupid. It is used
to justify in a humorous way an action
that has been deemed by the public as
unacceptable or even just insane. But in
all seriousness, what has happened to so-
ciety when the notion ofliving one’s life
to the fullest has been reduced to joke
form? Am I missing something, or do we
not really only live once?

I’m not saying that people should
live by following their every whim, and
of course common sense is a factor. I am
admittedly the last person you will ever
see shirking responsibility for the sake of

doing something without abandon. But it
is this rigidity within me that makes me
pause to reconsider the notion of YOLO.
Instead of looking at life in such a black
and white way, crazystupidYOLO or
so called ‘reality,’ we should think of

gations to the people in my life and so-
ciety at large. As a freshman in college,
living to the fullest should incorporate
respect for the opportunities offered to
me here—academically as well as so-
cially. In other words, while I won’t go

the line between living vivaciously and living reck-

to the fullest in a way that satisﬁes the
demands of day-to-day life and the de-
mands of enjoyment. I would shudder
to look back on my life and see only an
endless parade of grey days ﬁlled with
studying and nights ‘stayed in.’ Howev-
er, I would shudder equally as much if I
felt I squandered my life away by acting

COLUMMST and the like. So
what to do with
the last three months of pure freedom?
Well, you could sit around your parents’
house and hang out with your old high
school friends or.....
You could go to a foreign

sophomore year 4

country and have a fun adventure! Spe-
ciﬁcally, you could become an au pair.
Now some would argue that “au pair” is
just a fancy way of saying “nanny” that
is supposed to make the job of watching
small people appear a bit more enticing.
I would disagree. I spent the last sum-
mer in Madrid, Spain, hanging out with
a Spanish family. It was literally the best
summer of my life. Being an au pair is
more than just watching kids for a few
hours a day. If you’re lucky, it can be
educational, fun, and party-ﬁlled. So if
you don’t have plans for the summer yet
here are a few reasons to check it out.

Firstly, the application process can
be really fast. Agencies differ, but it is
totally possible to apply and be accepted
and matched with a family within two
to three weeks. Plenty of time from now
until May.

Secondly, kids actually kind of rock.’
I got matched with a family with one
3-year-old. His name was Marco. I seri-
ously can’t overstate how cute this kid
was. He had huge brown puppy dog

. eyes, was about a foot tall, and didn’t

speak any English. Adorable. Needless
to say he had me wrapped around his
ﬁnger in no time and I actually came to
love playing kid games again. It was like
second childhood. That being said, com-
ing back to school after having spent all
summer with crayons, bubbles, and rub-
ber duckies was a bit of an adjustment.
Location, location, location. This
matters so much when choosing where
to be an au pair. Big cities are the way
to go. While a family may own a love-
ly villa in the country-side this place is
likely to be isolated. So unless you never
want a break from the fam (which you

will, naturally), cities are the way to go.

As long as you have that you are pretty-

good to go; most families who get au
pairs are rather wealthy. I lived in a high
rise apartment in the middle of Madrid.
There was a pool right outside our door.

as far as to suggest “laying in a puddle
and screaming ‘I’m drowning!’” or “us-
ing white paint on my teeth so you never
have to brush them again,” I urge you to
find a balance in your daily life, and con-
sider the true meaning of YOLO, jokes

aside. Wear your fanny pack out. Aﬂer

all, you do only live once.

Looking for a summer of travel, child care, and partying? Columnist Sally Platt thinks you should be an au pair

time I stayed out till 6am, congratulating
me on “ﬁtting in” and “adjusting to the
Spanish way of life.”

All this being said, this is not for men.
Agencies don’t accept them because
families just don’t want them. I guess

My family was ecstatic the ﬁrst time I stayed out till

6am, congratulating me on ‘ﬁtting in” and “aajust-

ing to the Spanish way of life.

It was a ten minute walk to Sol, the Pra-
do, Retiro, and the Royal Palace (basi-
cally the highlights of Madrid).

Another great reason to go au-pairing
is the language factor. Countries all over
the world have au pair agencies (al-

though they are more common in Eu-
rope). So whatever language you are
trying to learn, you can become really
ﬂuent from a summer of doing this.
Many families will speak little to no
English so picking up on the language
is really an imperative. That being said,
you hear it non-stop so it isn’t hard. I
came back practically ﬂuent in Span-
ish. '

Families in Spain, Europe, and I
hope everywhere else love vacations.
This means you go on a lot of vaca-
tions. I went to the Mediterranean coast
one week, Santander for another, and
even made it down to Africa for a bit.
Luckily for me all the aunts and uncles
of the kid, Mafco, came along too.
While they were all oohing and awing
over how cute their little nephew was
I got loads of free time torlie on the
beach and sample the ample nightlife
that Spain is so famous for.

People in Europe love partying.
Even old people. There is absolutely no
taboo over drinking or staying out all

night. My family was ecstatic the ﬁrst

aprons haven’t quite made it across the
gender divide yet. The only male au pair
I met was, shall we say, a little more than
south of pink.

So if you want a sweet summer ﬁlled
with new people, parties, and adorable
small people you should apply to be an
au pair. You’ll have your language re-
quirement in the bag and not be bothered
by your parents telling you to “get a job”
all summer. Adventure is there for the

taking!

Energy issues, addressed

Professor lectured last Tuesday on the future of energy and how we can invest now

By Colleen Moore
5 TA F F w R I T E R
“The IQ of people drops about 20
points when they are talking about en-
ergy,” joked Professor Jim Kahn at the
opening of his lecture last Tuesday night.
Kahn said a coordinated policy to ad-
dress future energy use should be based
on four ideas:
1. Quit crying about gasoline prices
2. “Drill baby drill” is not an energy
policy
3. Corn is evil ,
4. End the use of coal in the next ten
years

Energy use is one of the most press-
ing problems of the 21*‘ century and we
must begin making difﬁcult and compro-
mising choices for the long run now.

In order to begin to frame the discus-
sion about energy policies, Kahn said, we
need to recognize the role of government
in facilitating research and development

as well as technological innovation.

“With a problem as vexing as the
energy problem, with solutions as com-
plicatedas the energy problem, we need
policy,” said Kahn.

’ Kahn’s comprehensive plan to ad-
dress our energy problem rested on sev-
eral issues.

First, with any change we make or
any technology we improve upon, there
is a possibility ofirreversibility.

“We are stuck with the negative con-
sequences of the old technology, even
if better technology comes along,” said
Kahn. One example of this is the “drill

baby drill” policy, which results in ir—'

reversible increases in atmospheric con-
centrations of greenhouse gases. Even
sources of alternative energy, including
hydro-power and nuclear power, have
long lived environmental costs.

The second issue is diversiﬁcation.

There will always be capacity con-
straints with any policy. Kahn suggests
diversifying our energy portfolio to re-
duce this limitation.

The third issue Kahn talked about
revolved around extemalities, which are
the unintended consequences of our en-
ergy use. Unfortunately, these extemali-
ties are huge — global climate change,
environmental problems and even na-
tional security. For every $500 billion
dollars spent on the military, the social
cost per gallon of gas increases about ten
additional dollars.

The other points Kahn spoke on were
the directionality of wealth and car-
bon, greater innovation potentials, the
sequence of the effects of our choices
and ﬁnally, alleviation of poverty. Kahn
pointed out that in the last five years we
have doubled our estimates of solar en-
ergy limits, but we still need to be aware

of the consequences of our decisions.

“Our choices in the short—run are go-
ing to affect our options in the medium
and 1ong—run, and our choices in the
medium run will affect our option in the
long-run,” said’ Kahn.

Professor Kahn’s recommendations
for a policy that addresses each of these
points involves correctly pricing fossil
fuels, investing in alternative technolo-
gies and developing partnerships with
other countries. “The future of the global
planet depends on what the rapidly in-
dustrializing countries are doing,” said
Kahn. The United States can’t simply
deal with these issues domestically — the
energy problem is a global problem.

More speciﬁcally, Kahn believes that
moving to biofuels is a real possibility.
United Airlines and TAM Airlines have
both experimented with this recently.
We also need to invest in rechargeable

hybrid cars and penalize the destruction
of ecosystems while rewarding carbon
cycling and sequestration. Kahn argues,
“We need to make it costly for people to
convert ecosystems.”

The key is to think long-tenn and
not expect immediate payback of en-
ergy investments. Many of our energy
actions have social costs that we don’t
fully recognize. Moving forward with a

structured and coordinated policy plan ‘'

requires the aid of the government to
sponsor research and development for
technological innovation and for expan-
sion our energy options.

How can we afford to do all this?
Kahn responds, “How can we afford not
to?”

Spotlight on a student director

Student directed “Two Rooms ” involves Mindbending and the entire W&L Theatre department

By Lauren Howry
5 TA F F w R IT E R
For the first time ever, the Washington
and Lee theater department and Mind-
bending, a student organization, have
joined together to present a play. “Two
Rooms” by Lee Blessing will show to-
night and tomorrow night at 7 p.m. in the
Maslansky Rehearsal Hall.
Mary Rodriguez ’l3, theater major
and vice president of Mindbending, di-

rects the play with a crew and cast made
up of both faculty and fellow students.

It is atypical to have a student direc-
tor, because it’s like trying to juggle with
no hands. Mary said, “Directing is a lot
of responsibility. You are in control of
every aspect of the play, but not directly.
So you have to ﬁnd a way to shape it all
without stifling it.”

But Mary isn’t putting on a one-
woman show. She has a cast of talented
actors to help bring Blessing’s work to
life: Jeni Pritchett ‘l2, Jesse Mozingo
‘I3, and two ﬁrst-years, Nick Lehotsky
and Caroline Crichlow-Ball. They have
all contributed hours of effort to bring
this production to fruition.

It is a play that tugs at the audience’s

nerves as it delves into the emotional

I fallout of a hostage situation in Beirut.

As Mary describes, “The show is very
sad--but cathartic--and very relevant to
what’s happening in the world today”.
The plot is wrapped in political motiva-
tions thatspeak to a broad audience.
The entire show is a collaborative
effort by the Theatre Department to

show support and openness to hands-
on learning experiences. All the behind
the scenes action, including costumes,
lighting and publicity, is being done by
pairs made up of faculty members and
students.

No tickets are necessary to attend the
show.

7 - THE RING-TUM PHI-

ANDREW RENALIDO

Between ﬁnishing term papers and preparing for ﬁnal exams,
this is one of the busiest times of the year for students. In addi-
tion to caffeine and the promise of an upcoming break, sports are
keeping me going. That’s because April is thankfully the best
sports month of the calendar year.

Let’s start with March Madness. After watching our brackets
go to shambles during the hectic and always enjoyable ﬁrst few

S'l‘El’llEN PECK

For a sports fan, I don’t know how much better it can get than the
month of October.

It’s an interesting argument. On one hand, and as Ricky Renaldo
so eloquently put it, you have April with the Masters, the NFL draft,
MLB opening day, and NBA and NHL playoffs. Being from Michi-
gan, April is also the month where the sun actually begins to show its
face after another dismal and seemingly endless winter. So that’s nice.

rounds of the tournament, we are ready to a crown a tournament
winner in April. We look forward to the best players cementing
their one-year legacies and laying the groundwork for Nike to re-
release their college jerseys as cool collectibles from their “ama-
teur” days. The ﬁnal contestants will hopefully treat us to some
spectacular plays that will feature prominently in future YouTube
compilations set to epic music. This is April’s appetizer.

What’s the best sports month of the year?

Andrew and Stephen debate which month is
better in terms of sports, April or October.

But the month of October is the one time of the year when you
physically do not have enough TV’s to watch every sporting event
that is on.‘

First off, October belongs‘-to Major League Baseball. Baseball
usually manages to cram all three rounds of its playoffs in October,
resulting in some of the sport’s most memorable moments when the
games matter most.

We then move to the Masters. Cue CBS’s commercials with
sappy piano chords and Jim Nantz reminding us that this is a tra-
dition unlike any other. The history, azaleas and green jacket make the Masters the best golf
event of the year and a reminder of why sports and beautiful spring weather are a great match.
If golf is not quite your thing, the major league baseball season also starts around the same
time. With everyone starting the year on level ground in the standings, opening day is always
full of excitement and optimism. The start of baseball season is also a reminder that summer and
lazy days in the nearest ballpark are just around the corner. It means that SportsCenter will be-
gin to feature an obnoxious amount of baseball highlights as well, but this is a small concession.

knows that the playoffs are like a new season with higher stakes and chippier action. The best
players start performing at the peak of their powers, the most rugged players start growing the
gnarliest beards (in hockey’s case), and coaches start doing more awkward in-game interviews
with Craig Sager (in basketball’s case).. It’s incredibly’ entertaining, and there are games to
watch every night.

Unfortunately there’s no football in April, but we do get treated to the NFL draft. Besides
being Mel Kiper’s piece de resistance, the draft is also a well of hope for fans of every franchise.
Will that quarterback that your team is drafting lead his teammates to greatness, mediocrity, or
ruin? We usually never know the answer until several years down the road, but we still love
digesting analysis that less than half of the time proves to be correct.

If that’s not enough for you, the Champions League of European soccer plays quarterﬁnal
and semiﬁnal matches in April. If you’re not familiar, this competition features the best club
teams in Europe. The ﬁnal is the Super Bowl of club soccer. The possibility exists this year that
Barcelona will play archrival Real Madrid in the ﬁnal. This would be like Duke playing UNC
for the national championship in basketball, if Durham and Chapel Hill were cosmopolitan cit-
ies that fought on opposite sides of a civil war less than 100 years ago.

April thus brings not only a multitude of sports action, but very meaningful sporting events.
It marks the culmination of some sports’ seasons and the exciting beginning of others. So as
you get back to your mountain of schoolwork, rest assured that the best sports month of the year
is here to help you cope.

As we get further into April, the NBA and NHL playoffs begin. Any fan of these two leagues!

Don Larsen’s perfect game. Kirk Gibson’s hobbled pinch-hit
home run. Bill Mazeroski’s walk-off bomb to lift the Pirates over the
Yankees. All iconic October moments. .

Reggie Jackson’s heroics in the 1977 and ’78 playoffs earned him the lifelong distinction of Mr.
October. Mr. April just doesn’tihave that same ring to it.

October also owns four (sometimes ﬁve if we are lucky) weekends of professional and college
football. For a nation that decidedly revolves around football, this is nirvana, and something that
April lacks. -

Last October, we saw the Lions beat the Bears on Monday Night Football and start 5-0 for the
ﬁrst time since I956. We saw surprisingly hot starts by the Bills and 49ers. We saw the Packers roll
through the entire league. We saw Jim Schwartz and Jim Harbaugh almost get in a ﬁstﬁght. And we
saw the emergence of some guy named Tebow.

In the collegiate ranks, last October gave us a host of upsets (Auburn over South Carolina, Wake
Forest over FSU, UVA over Georgia Tech, GT over Clemson, Texas Tech over Oklahoma) and memo-
rable games (Michigan State’s hail mary to beat Wisconsin, Oklahoma blows out Texas in the Red
River Shootout, Stanford’s epic triple-overtime win over Southern Cal).

And of course with all this football, -comes tailgates, fantasy football, endless Tim Tebow talk, Lee
Corso swearing on the College Gameday set, Erin Andrews, and NFL Redzone.

Just for good measure October marks the beginning of the NBA season, allowing us as fans to
once again direct our unwarranted but wildly intense hatred at LeBron James, listen to Charles Bark-
ley destroy the English language, and watch Javale McGee do something unbelievably dumb.

The NHL season also begins, but the good people here in Virginia are probably more excited about
the four NASCAR races in October than they are about watching Canadians and Russians ice skate.

Although October marks the end of summer, it also brings us the best holiday of the year: Hal-
loween. '

Although W&L may not celebrate it as well as other larger state schools do (for reasons that the
gentlemen ofthis school understand), Halloween at its very essence, is an incredible holiday.

What other time can you dress up as a superhero and get free candy from neighbors‘?

Never. The answer is never. -

There is nothing like October.

SPORTS EDITOR

 

Washington and Lee’s men’s swim

I’ team coach Joel Shinoﬁeld ofﬁcially re-

signed last week.

Shinoﬁeld ﬁrst came to W&L as a
student. He graduated as a biology major
in 1994. He returned less than ten years
later after becoming W&L’s men’s swim
coach and the director of aquatics.

Shinoﬁeld told Generalssports.com, “I
am grateful to Athletic Director Jan Ha-
thom, former Athletic Directors Chuck
O’Connell and Mike Walsh, as well as
President Ruscio for giving me the op-
portunity to coach the sport I love at my
alma mater.”

Shinoﬁeld has made the most of his

I opportunity since his return in 2003. In

his very ﬁrst year he won the Bluegrass
Mountain Conference Coach of the Year.
Other accolades include being a recipient
of the American Swimming Coaches As-

sociation Award of Excellence in 2008,
as well as coaching W&L to Bluegrass
Mountain Conference championship vic-
tories on four occasions. I

This season his team placed fourth at
the BMC Championships. Many of his
athletes moved on a qualiﬁed for nation-
als. That group placed 16'‘ overall in Indi-
ana two weeks ago. Three athletes earned
four separate individual All-American
certiﬁcates while three separate relays
teamed ‘up to earn All-American certiﬁ-
cates as well.

Shinoﬁeld has said that he has been
honored to coach his athletes at W&L for
nine years.

_ “They have had a great deal of success
in and out of the pool,” Shinoﬁeld told
Generalssports.com. “I’m proud of the
way that they achieved their goals.”

The Washington and Lee baseball team
came out on the losing end ofa pitcher’s duel
on Wednesday, falling to Bridgewater College
by a score of 2-0.

Despite allowing only one run through sev-
en innings on the mound, senior pitcher Jody
Davis was charged with the hard luck loss.
The 22"‘ ranked Eagles pushed across their
run in the top of the sixth inning. Two singles
and a walk loaded the bases for Christian
Armstrong, who lifted a ﬂy ball to left ﬁeld to
score Jonathan Mason from third base.

Bridgewater would add an insurance run in
the top of the ninth by way ofa two out single
by senior catcher Devin Snow.

The Generals’ bats were quieted by
Bridgewater starter Jonathan Lucas. The se-
nior southpaw allowed only two singles in
seven innings of work. He was followed by
freshman lefthander Corey Armentrout, who
earned the save by pitching the ﬁnal two
frames. Armentrout held the Generals without
a hit and surrendered only one walk.

At the plate, the Generals were led by ju-
nior third baseman Chris Nault and senior
center ﬁelder Mike Decembrino, who each
went 1-3 with a single. Junior shortstop Jona-
than Stutts ﬁnished the game with three walks.

in the conference and 9-3 overall.

Washington and Lee ﬁnished the ﬁrst half
up just three, but the team was able to score
ﬁve unanswered goals en route to scoring ten
in the second half.

Mulligan allowed three in the ﬁrst half and
just two goals in the second as Washington
and Lee took a commanding lead.

Once again the Generals were led by the
strong performances of Benedetti, who scored
two goals and had game—high four ground
balls, McKaig, who scored a game—high four
goals, and Lavin and Shearin, who scored
three goals apiece.

Junior Taylor Harding scored a team-high
two goals for the Marlins. Senior Michelle
Mace spent a little over 40 minutes in the

net, allowing ten goals and saving four. Se- '

nior goalie Brittany Macknew saved two and
allowed six goals in a little less than twenty
minutes of play.

Accepted students were able to experience W&L academics and student life last week

New “'l'rospip” Statistics

By Graham Colton
CO PY E DITO R

On Accepted Students’ Day last
Wednesday, I93 admitted students from
34 states ﬂocked to Washington and Lee
University to get a head start on their
collegiate careers. Accompanied by 282
family members, 73 conﬁrmed students
and I20 unconﬁrmed students attended
a continental breakfast, panel sessions,
a Student Activities Fair and Residence
Hall tours, a luncheon and Department
Open Houses.

This special preview of the Univer-
sity was put on by the Office of Admis-
sions staff. “Accepted Students’ Day is
a chance for admitted students and their
families to see inside what it's like to
be a student at W&L,” explained Jenny
Ratzel ’07, Assistant Director of Ad--
missions. “It’s also a great opportunity
for students who are still undecided to
ask questions and learn more about the
school before conﬁrming."

With the University as their oyster,
high school seniors and their parents
ﬂooded the campus to go to college for
a day. Armani Smith, from Indianapolis,
IN, said: “Greek life is a pretty big deal
here...I went to a few frat parties last
night. They were pretty chill.”

Others, like Paulsboro, N.l native
Billy Davis, were in awe of a campus
where Robert E. Lee himself once re-
sided. “Nobody walked on the grass,”

Davis stated. Other admitted students
also revered the Honor System and the
school pride it has instilled in W&L stu-
dents past and present.

“[Wednesday’s] event was a success
thanks to the hard work of our staff, stu-
dents and faculty,” Ratzel said.

Lizzie Engel ’l3, coordinator of the
Student Recruitment Committee’s in-
volvement in Accepted Students’ Day,
served the students by “working the reg-
istration tables, leading campus tours,
manning information kiosks, and just
generally being around to help direct ac-
cepted students and their families.”

President Kenneth Ruscio and Wil-
liam M. Hartog, the Dean of Admis-
sions and Financial Aid, lent their time
to welcome visitors at the Keller Theater
of the Lenfest Center. Faculty members
also made themselves available to pro-
spective students at campus-wide De-
partment Open Houses. By doing so,
“students who are still undecided [may]
ask questions and learn more about the
school before conﬁrming,” said Ratzel.

Before going to the Activities Fair
on the Commons Lawn and touring the
Graham-Lees Dormitoryat midday, stu-
dents attended panel sessions on topics
ranging from athletics to research and
studying abroad. A future varsity athlete
who attended the athletics panel session

emphasized the value of school over
sports. He said, “Lacrosse doesn’t
come before academics.”

Other high school students, after at-
tending a research panel, were struck by
the breadth and availability of research
opportunities for undergraduate stu-
dents. Davis said he was “shocked that
one [student] had four different research
projects.”

Emily Streeper, an admitted student
interested in pre-med from Pennsylva-
nia, said she will matriculate here not
only for the “very strong neuroscience
department,” but also for “the research. ..
available after the ﬁrst year.”

Amy Hui, from Gretna, LA, ex-
pressed her excitement regarding “the
ability to do whatever [she] wants for
research.”

Several students were intrigued by
the diverse opportunities to study over-
seas. At the panel on studying abroad,
Smith said that there was “an All—Amer-
ican swimmer who studied abroad in
Spain.”

Virginia F eddeman, from Annandale,

VA, said she “liked the St. Andrews part—'

nership” and observed that the Scottish
university offers transferable credits in
an American-style system.

Yet, for all parties involved, the high-
light of the day was the chance to begin

' and leadership culmi-

building friendships
that will last beyond
the four short years on
campus. Ratzel’s fa-
vorite part of the day
was “watching the ad-
mitted students get to
know each other. They
start to form friend-
ships and bonds with
their classmates before
they even get to cam-
pus.”

In the afternoon,
students and families
chatted with one an-
other over lunch on
Cannan Green. The
Admissions Office’s
planning, coordination,

nated in eight events on
a day which, according
to Streeper, was “one
of the best, well run
[Accepted Students’
Days]” which she had
attended.

after his speech in Lee

Adrian Grenier, best known as

'2 Vince Chase-in the HBO’s Entou-

rage, made an appearance in Lee

' Chapel on Tuesday, April 24. Wash-

ington and Lee was the last stop on
his college tour, during which he has
promoted his 2010 HBO documen-
tary Teenage Paparazzo, and starting
conversations with college students
about the effect of media and tech-
nology on the world.

“Whether it’s paparazzi or a kid
bullying on Facebook, we have to
start having conversations about how
to use the tools we have.” he stated.

Grenier invited the audience to
ask questions about the documentary
and the role of media and technology
in today’s world.

He described Teenage Paparazzo
as a documentary about a 14-year-
old paparazzo named Austin Viss-
chedyk. Grenier detailed going out
in Hollywood one night when he
noticed Visschedyk among the pa-
parazzi. “When I was 13, I was out
that late and I wasn’t doing anything
creative,” said Grenier.

Grenier started by making a

_ documentary about the teenager to

explore the society’s obsession with
celebrities. Now, he uses his foot-
age to start conversations around the
country about the media.

“There’s a wisdom in exchange,”
said Grenier. “It’s not enough to ab-
sorb what you’re bombarded with
by the media everyday. You have to
think about it and regurgitate it in
some way.”

Grenier said the public and the
paparazzi have to take responsibility
for the media produced today. “We’re
indulging this celebrity industry ﬁ-
nancially,” he said. The paparazzi

can claim that this indulgence is a‘
matter of survival for them, because
people pay for the scandalous shots
and salacious gossip.

When asked whether some ce-
lebrities court the paparazzi, Grenier
said they sometimes do. “If you’re
going to make a career choice to. be a
performer, you want people to watch
your performance,” he said.

Interestingly, he named Paris
Hilton as the ﬁrst postmodern “ar-
tiste” to use the tabloids as her can-
vas. “The stunts she pulled [for the
paparazzi] were kind of genius,” he
said. “I think Andy Warhol would be
proud.”

Greenier also pointed_ out that
with all the technology available
today, there’s more opportunity for
creativity than ever before. Accord-
ing to him, most people don’t realize
that technology is not “conﬁned to
the design dictated by Apple.”

“The real artists are the guys and
girls who can program,” he said.

In an age where it seems like ba-
bies are “out of the womb and onto
a computer,” Grenier states that it
is this generation’s responsibility to
learn to use technology and the me-
diacwell--he said people need to start
talking about these different tools,
how they’re being used, and how
they should be used. ‘

“I think we’re going to ﬁgure this
out,” said Grenier, holding his phone
in the air.

At the end of the discussion, Gre-
nier asked the audience to pull out
their iPhones, take a picture of them-
selves, and send it to him via his free
app, “Reckless Adrian Grenier.” Fol-
lowing the discussion, Grenier and
students went to the Commons Liv-

ing Room where several art pieces
related to the ﬁlm were on display.
Grenier then joined students at the
Alumni House for a reception and
photos.

(Oh, and if you missed it: When
asked who his best on-screen kiss
was with he said, “Politically speak-
ing, they were all fantastic, but not as
good as the real thing.”)

@Justapersons.° @RingTumPhi Sooo not a fan of twitter #hearmeout

Let me start
off by saying
that I have a
Twitter ac-
count, so don’t
take the criti-
cal tone of this
column too se-
riously. While
it may seem
hypocritical
that I have such
strong feel-
ings against the
tweeting sensa-
tion that’ grips
the nation, I
feel as though I must make my voice
heard. Consider this my epic tweet:
#Ihatetwitter.

Let me explain: ﬁrst, there is
the conceited nature of the tweet. Why
is it that people think that the rest of the
world is so interested in what they are
doing? Do you really think anyone cares
that you’re eating breakfast, taking a nap,
or feeling nauseous? Why do we feel the
need to share every intimate detail of our
daily lives to people who are only fol-
lowing us to compare what we are doing
to what they are doing? Bringing me to
my next point: Twitter is nothing more

the rest of their friends what

other friends. Therein lies
the beauty of the “mention,”
which allows you to tag an-
other person in your tweet,
just in case “#nowwatching
Revenge with my besties”
wasn’t good enough. If you
can “tweet at” your “bes-
ties,” they too can broad-
cast their status to the world
of Twitter. And there is the
fact that people who can see
your tweets are called “fol-
lowers.” Followers. Need I
say more?

_ And, of course,
there is hashtagging, or
“trending.” Trending has
no clear deﬁnition on Twit-
ter, other than the unspoken
rule that the funnier or wit-
tier your trend is, the bet-
ter the tweet. I like to think
of trending as adding a little spice to a
tweet, taking it from something like,
“Just got to class” to, “Just got to class
#canileavenow?” In this case, the addi-
tion of a hashtag conveys the emotion
and adds a sardonic edge. Yet albeit the

snide comment about some-

levels. I am guilty ofthis, and
I know I speak for the Twitter
community when I say that it
is humorous to read a tweet
with a funny quote from a
classmate or professor. But to spend time
that our parents have paid for (in a class

This brings me to my ﬁnal and
most sincere critique of Twitter. I ﬁnd it
ironic that something made to function
as a method of connecting people can
create such a sense of disconnect among
friends. Why would you check Twitter
when you’re surrounded by people, if
not to make sure that nothing “better” is
going on at the same time? Even. when
surrounded by their friends, I have seen
people (and I myselfhave done this) take
the precious moments they should be en-
joying together to, yes, check Twitter. It
is an unconscious (or conscious) attempt
to check out what the rest of the commu-
nity is doing and mentally compare it to
what you are_doing.

Again, I have to emphasize that
this column is meant to be a channel to

it has made our community appear self-
absorbed and disconnected. But, like I
said, I have a Twitter and I tweet on a
somewhat regular basis. I have a Twitter
because it exists, and I have one in order
to feel like I “belong.” But, my wish is
that it didn’t exist. . .I hate Twitter.

Campbell Burr describes her struggle to ﬁnd feminine work attire

. .’ “What is wrong
«- I ‘ with short?” my mom

' " ’ asks as I zip up the
newest “work skirt”
she has purchased for
me. It rides mid—thigh
 and looks more like
something I would
wear clubbing in Eu-
rope than in an ofﬁce.
“Mom, I can’t
wear this in an oﬁice!

. Are you kidding me?”

“It’s so cute
though. You’re a sum-
mer intern, it’s ﬁne.”

She makes a good point. Do I really need a
suit to get coffee and sit in a small cubicle en-
tering data into an Excel spreadsheet? Ehlih,
well-— yes. The male interns will be wearing
suits so I, of course, must be dressed in the
female equivalent. After a week of shopping,
it seems like there are few options, unless I
want to be “one ofthe boys” and ﬁll my ward-
robe with dull, black pantsuits.

We began the week shopping for pantsuits,
which my mom was not particularly excited
about. “Why would you try to dress like a
man?”

I agreed, but hoped that we would come
across a suit with a little feminine ﬂair. After
all, I’m not the only woman in the workforce.
I found some suit jackets that had a nice cut,
cute buttons, or were made by a designer
whose clothes usually ﬁt me well. When it
came time to try everything on in the dress-
ing room, I had the worst of luck. Every time,
the jacket would ﬁt but the pants would be

a few more bad options, I decided to move

her father’s clothes, time to scan the racks for

call. Maybe I could ﬁnd a few suitable pieces
and go from there. My mom decided that she
would look through her closet as well, since
we can usually ﬁt into the same size.

She lay all of her options across my bed.
Did she think I was interning for a housewife?

work dresses.

This pursuit was not as successful as I had
hoped and I began feeling like the world was
out to get me. Either I) I would ﬁnd a dress
that ﬁt me perfectly and then I would ﬁnd
some tacky detail, like a large silver zipper
across the front, that made it unbearable (kind
of like shopping for corduroys at Limited
Too: ﬁnding the perfect pair and then turning
them around to ﬁnd sparkles across the back
pockets). 2) I would come across lots of cute
dresses at a place where I frequently shop
but they would be made for someone with a
curvier ﬁgure. Maybe I should check the chil-
dren’s section?

After chugging a Double-Big Gulp of Diet
Coke, the ultimate moral booster, I decided
that revisiting my wardrobe would be a good

across the waist. I looked like a mom straight
out of the 1950s. I imagined walking into
work the ﬁrst day and asking my boss where
he had put my typewriter.

My mom has continued shopping for me
since and has fortunately had luck. Even
though many of my work dresses will be
black and have similar cuts, at least I will
know that I am not wearing the same thing
everyday.

So, next time you hear a boy complain-
ing about how hot he gets in his suit in the
summer, remind him to be thankful that he
can buy all of his suits, shirts, and ties in one
place and never worry about whether or not
he looks “work appropriate.”

Just about
' two weeks ago,
after an unbear-
ably long and
T horribly predict-
able « primary
season, Mr.
 Santorum gave
up his campaign
for the Republi-
can nomination
for ' President
following the
release of poor
polling numbers
out of his home
state of Pennsylvania and the illness of
his daughter. This added to his poor per-
formance in the primaries in Maryland,
Washington D.C., and Wisconsin, where
Mitt Romney swept the ﬂoor to 655 of
the 1,144 delegates he needed to clinch
the Republican nomination. This put him
miles ahead of political arch-nemesis
Rick Santorum, who at the time carried
only 278, despite commanding wins in
numerous states that truly represent the
identity of America; states like Colora-
do, Tennessee, North Dakota, Louisiana,
Iowa, Alabama, and Mississippi. This
string of losses and the overwhelming
odds Santorum suffered put his cam-
paign on the ropes. The majority of ana-
lysts and my fellow Republican voters
across the country at the time were ten-
tatively removing their necks from their
suspended belts (probably brown belts to
go with those great Sperrys they bought
last year) to delay the merciful embrace
ofDeath, ﬁnally reconsidering the worth
of our lives after Santorum’s concession.
Regardless, Santorum’s refusal to bow to
the harsh mistress that is reality contin-
ued until his concession on April 10th,
Santorum appeared dead-set on fighting.
I’d like to offer my own opinion on why
Santorum failed to clinch the nomina-

tion, some notes on his seemingly sense-
less determination, and a few tips on
what he could have done to improve his
chances of victory.

Santorum’s poor performance in the
primaries can be partially attributed

to the fact that he was very busy with

other pursuits that took up much of his
time. These notable endeavors include
prominent roles on a couple of Comedy
Central TV shows, expanding negative
Catholic stereotypes to a new genera-
tion of voters, not to mention efforts to
weed out several undesirables from the
ranks of the Republican Party (nobody
we’d miss+just Hispanics, blacks, gays,
women, poor people, college students,

college grads, and white collar profes- I

sionals).'However, his poor electoral
performance, busy schedule, and not
even math deterred him from seeking

vindication in the eyes of the Republi- "5

can Party,vAmerica, and probably a fa-

ther that never said,“Good job, son.”:':.

said (a mere week before conceding) it
was “only half-time” in the Republican
primary season, and this church league
basketball game has a no mercy rule...
unless what you’re referring to is San-
torum’s mercy in conceding to the other
team and letting all the bored parents go
home and watch real basketball on TV.
Rick Santorum’s determination and
courage to tell the truth about the gay
conspiracy to destroy the country, to
mumble half-formulated racial slurs, and
to stare American women right in the
uterus with a straight face and tell them
that the pill is dangerous has inspired me
so much that l’ve decided to give him a
few tips for any future pursuits for the
White House. Here are a few things in
his campaign he could have done better.
If Santorum’s campaign was going
to have any shot at the White House, it
had to get back some ofthat momentum

it had just a few short weeks before the

I’m sure one of those slogans would

‘have cast aside Santorum’s appearance

himself to hang out with you and your
friends only to get into pointless argu-
ments with everyone, making it real
awkward for you, because you don’t

really don’t want to just tell him to leave,
but he just doesn’t seem to take any hints
that he’s not welcome and then he gets

Now, if he had made that adjustment

tothe editor

First things ﬁrst: l‘m old. I was a Lambda here in undergrad and next year
l‘ll start my third year oflaw school. l‘ve been around long enough to see a few
things change.

We used to have a newspaper worth reading at this school: The Trident. It
was lewd. It was profane. lt ﬂirted with slander while stomping on feelings, and
it never apologized. it was absolutely amazing. As a freshman and sophomore,
I watched the Trident verbally butcher my frat and others in issue after issue.
The discourse represented what most of us said in private, and the public airing

‘of grievances sometimes leant an almost cathartic, though occasionally only
enraging. texture to the articles. From the Bracket of Awfulness to the Bear’s
monthly dispensation of probably manically depressed vitriol. the paper insisted
on thick skins—an insistence that I think we could all beneﬁt from.

With genuinely hurtful student journalism in mind, I laughed out loud when
l saw the Special Editions histrionic bedwetting over Georgia Robertson’s at-
tempt at a presumably honest frat breakdown. Her article was a ball of Play--
Dough inside a velvet glove compared to the brutal sledgehammer of what
ought to genuinely offend and horrify young adults. if someone can explain to
me the evil in mentioning one group’s coke habit or another‘s social indiffer-
ence—\-vhen, to a certain extent, both exist——l‘d be much obliged. As much as
I value the Phi’s legendary ability to bore a cokehead to sleep after an 8ball on
Windfall. I for one appreciate the occasionally provocative Op-Ed. Not only do
major newspapers print themwalheit absent profanity~but such opinions rep-
resent and condense what W&L students blather about on a daily basis. Opin-
ions belong in the opinions section. How simple is that? And although Ms. Rob-
ertson won‘t win any awards for bravery, she deserves credit, not condemnation,
for more or less accurately summarizing bits and pieces of what a lot ofus think.

"The problem here is not content——free speech certainly extends its worn
and weathered shield to the mildly offensive~but anonymity. There’s nothing
wrong with an Op-ed expressing opinions based on experience. l, for example,
think that many Guy Phis always look vaguely unwashed. But I’m willing to
attach my name to what I write. Brutal honesty is only worth publishing if its
author accepts accountability. And more brutal honesty results in fewer Phi‘s
ending up next to the toilet, and in more ending up in dining rooms and on front
porches, inspiring debate.

That said, I understand why the Trident ofold had to go. Although much of
the school continued to love it, the paper became too vicious, too indifferent
to consequence or decency to continue—it spiraled out of control. And so the
Ring Tum Phi assumed the mantle ofour sole publication, doing so with a staid,
almost puritanical conservatism that esehewed the provocative like Cadavers
eschew relevance. There‘s something to be said for such “serious” journalism,
but l would love to see some ofthe Trident‘s subject matter return, its unfettered
salaciousness tempered by the restraint of responsible oversight. The Phi’s read-
crship would benefit. And even laugh occasionally.

    Top 10 Wildest Spring Term classes ,

Forget about tubing down the Maury; these wacky, exciting and outrageous courses put the fun ’in Spring Term

By Gabrielle Tremo
S TA F F w R I T E R

Spring Term: home of the four week
class. Whether you’re planning ahead
and getting rid of some FDRs, adding
credits to your major, travelling abroad,
or you’re going out on a limb and tak-
ing something you never even thought
existed, Spring Term is the perfect time
for it. Speaking to students, I found that
many of them decided to -use Spring
Term as an outlet to take the SL credit
they’ve always been dreading, or the
HA credit they were never able to ﬁt
into their classes. But, at the heart of it,
Spring Term is a “semester” famous for
its “out-there" classes. This article pro-
vides a glimpse into the core of Spring
Term to show us what the classes we all
wanted to take but couldn’t (or were too
scared to) are all about.

Music 102: Physics & Per-
ception of Music
Love music? Looking to

fulﬁll your SL credit? Here’s the class
for you. This course takes music as we
all understand it (aka, with our ears)
and translates it into what it’s doing at
the scientiﬁc level. From that, the class
tells you how your brain is listening and
interpreting the sounds you’re hearing.
As a lab science, there’s a lot of“hands-
on” work with music. By the end of the
course, you’re designing an auditorium
with the best materials and acoustics for
transmitting sound. With only a high
school understanding of physics neces-
sary, this class begins our list because
it combines something a lot of us love
with just enough science to mess with
our minds.
Highlight of the Class: Weekly jam
sessions every Friday? Sign me up.
9 losophy of Time Travel
Time Travel: the topic
that will incite the most heated debates
at the dinner table, sometimes even more
so than politics or religion. This class
explores the debate of what happens
when time travel occurs and what might
happen if you kill your great-great-
great-grandfather while in the time loop.
The course looks at movies that have

Philosophy 385: The Phi-

WAR GN li)Rl'JG*S C*i@N(°?'ERT -

sponsored by WLUR, Student Affairs, and the
General Activities Board. What a great way to
start the week!

depicted time—travel and contemporary
physicists’ views on the possibility and
implications oftraveling through time.

Highlight of the Class: Getting to
discuss movies like Terminator. Back to
the Future, and Planet ofthe Apes, all in
one class.

Nothing

I know what you’re all ask-
ing, and I understand. In an attempt to
explain what this class is, I may indeed
fail. This‘ course doesn’t teach subject
matter as much as it teaches the absence
of subject. A Course About Nothing
strives to teach students about different
methods ofthinking in different states of
mind, such as critical thinking, reading,
writing, imagining, rcﬁecting, contem-
plating, meditating, and dreaming, just
to name a few. '

This class explores the ideals of Zen
and other forms of meditation. To ex-
plain what I cannot, here is a sentence
from the syllabus: “This course is an
introduction to contemplative studies
(an emerging academic discipline) that
includes science, neuroscience, and a
philosophical-political inquiry of noth-
ing (of those .‘things’ that supposedly
aren’t: selﬁessness, emptiness, negation,
and freedom)”

Highlight of the Class: If you were
looking for a way to get your thoughts
organized over Spring Term, you‘ve
found it.

Film 285: Music in Stanley
’ Kubrick Films

Fan of The Shining? A C lock-
work Orange? 200/: A Space Odyssey?
This course explores the iconic nature of
these ﬁlms and, speciﬁcally, the music
within them. The purpose ofthis class is
to analyze what music choices Kubrick
made and how they inﬂuence the ﬁlms
through their presence. And, of course,
they do this by watching Stanley.Ku-
brick ﬁlms. _

Highlight of this Course: Being in
a room with a bunch of people while
watching Stanley Kubrick ﬁlms and see-
ing everyone’s reactions. Priceless.

8 Politics 297: A Course About

In honor of Holocaust"  
Remembrance Week, V f 
Hillel organized a vigil '
to take a stand against ,
oppression, especially . ,» , 
in light of the recent L’
events in Darfur, as well A
as tragedies in Bosnia,
Kashmir, and Germany.

The night, which began“ A
at 7 pm at Hillel House
last Thursday, featured a
variety of readings and
music to remember all
those who were lost.

Film 195: Music Video Pro-
duction

Whenever you and a friend
are listening to music you both like, how
many times have you turned to them and
said, “Have you seen this music video?”
Today, music videos are everywhere:
from a guy getting painted into the wall
in “Somebody I Used To Know” to the
latest Lonely Island single. FILM 195
looks at what goes into making a music
video and how to make one. From look-
ing at how to stage your video, to decid-
ing which lights and lenses are needed
to shoot it, to determining what effects
to add in during editing,-this class is lit-
erally the whole show.

Highlight ofthe Class: Making your
own music video and becoming the next
YouTube sensation (for better or for
worse).

Computer Science 251:
5 iPhone Application Program-
ming

Let’s face it: most of us have smart-
phones. After all, were students and
we need a computer in the palm of our
hands. We play our music on our way
to class, check e-mails to see where the
parties are, and look at what free apps
are available today. CSCI 251 has that
student in mind, by offering an entire
class about programming iPhone appli-
cations. Over the course of four weeks,
students learn how to program, produce,

and publish their own inventions. This"

Computer Science course uses Objec-
tive-C programming language compat-
ible with the iOS used on iPhone, iPad,
and the iPod Touch. For those who have
taken CSCI 112 or another pre-req, this
is a great way to expand some of your
computer languages to include a device
you use everyday.

Highlight of the Class: Uploading
your created app to the Apple Store...
and then buying it (aka getting all your
friends to get it as well).

English 255: Superheroes
4 We all have our favorite
superhero. Some like Super-
man, others have Spiderman lunch-

  
  
 

boxes, while a couple of us still wear
Batman pajamas (you know who you
are). So how about a class all about su-
perheroes? In reading everything from
the classic The Scarlet Pimpernel, to
studying Gladiator, to reading the ac-
claimed graphic-novel Watchmen, this
class looks not only at the “superhero”
as deﬁned by literature, but also at the
classic idea of what makes someone a
superhero.

Don’t be fooled by the “ENG” in the
beginning of “ENG 255”— Professor
Gavaler makes a great effort to pull in all
different sources, everything from old-
time comics to radio serials to movies
to Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog. This
course, which surveys everything from
the presence of superheroes in literature
to cultural impact of Nietzsche’s idea of
the superman, will deﬁnitely appeal to
every student’s sense of adventure.

Highlight of the class: As if this
weren’t already cool enough, the release
of Marvel’s The Avengers falls right at
the end of Week Two. '

Mathematics 369: The Math-
ematics of Puzzles & Games

To non—Math/Physics/En-:

gineering majors, the use of the word
“Mathematics” and “Games” might be
puzzling. But this class is, literally, all
fun and games (and math). The purpose
of this class is to look at board and puz-
zle games and to ﬁnd the mathematics
behind them to better understand how
the game works and how to beat your
friends at them.

When I asked Professor Dymacek for
the syllabus to write this article, he told
me, “That’s a little tricky. Because, you
see, the syllabus changes from year to
year depending on what the students de-
cide to play.” The students choose what
games they want to study and as a class
they learn and play them. All Spring
Term long. This is a 300 level Math
course, but I would be lying ifl said it
didn’t make me want to become a math
major. This year they are studying new-
er games such as Quoridor and Blockus,
as well as classics like learning the algo-
rithm to solving the Rubik’s Cube.

Highlight of the Class: Learning the
secrets to winning your favorite board
game? Can someone say, “Monopoly
Tournaments?”

Engineering 295: Concrete
Canoe

Every year the American
Society for Civil Engineers puts on a
competition to see_if students can design
and race a canoe made of concrete. And,
while I’m asking, “How is this even
possible?” a group of W&L students is
busy ﬁguring out how to do it. This class
combines the disciplines of engineering,
physics, and chemistry to conjure up
something that seems literally impossi-
ble. Together as a class the students will
design, produce, and enter the competi-
tion with a concrete canoe of their own
to race against other students. Needless
to say, “awesome.”
Highlight of the Class: “Defying the
laws of physics” looks pretty impressive
on a resume.

Chemistry 155: Science of
1 Cooking: Italy

One of Spring Term’s most
popular and sought after courses,
CHEM 155 looks at the chemistry in-
volved in cooking. This year the class
takes place abroad in a country whose
culture is food: ltalia! The course covers
what happens when you cook everyday
things like meat, vegetables and fruits
but also some other culinary devices like
gels, foams, and emulsions. Lectures
with complementary traditional Italian
cooking lessons and ﬁeld trips to vari-
ous factories (cheese, chocolate, gelato,
and wine... just to name a few) turn this
class into the perfect mix of education
and vacation.

Dr. France, the professor in charge
of the trip, said, “The course is a great
way for students to fulﬁll their science
FDR in a fun and interesting way that
has practical applications they can apply
to their daily lives.” I believe her.

Highlight of the class: Can you say
“Eaming your SC credit while eating
gelato?” Yum.

most valuable player. »

2011-l2NBAMVP.

Voters will most likely crown Lebron James as the 2011-12
NBA MVP in the coming weeks. If I were given a ballot, however,
I would not choose “King” James. While James deserves recogni-
tion for his incredible statistical feats this season, I believe Chris
Paul is more deserving of the award."

It’s only fair to begin by admitting my opinion may be
slightly biased. I am not a Lebron fan, and have not been since his
ﬁnal years in Cleveland. I do not blame him for leaving Cleveland
as many do, but instead dislike his apparent lack of maturity. Yes,
Lebron speaks well, has avoided trouble despite entering the league
as a teenager, and seems like a kind person. Yet he does not seem
to be honest with himself. He has cosigned on having his own
line of Nike shoes, “witness” ad campaigns, “chosen one” tattoos,

‘ premature preseason title parades, and a nationally televised “Deci-
sion,” all of which suggest he wants to be the center of attention
and associated with greatness. His passivity during big moments,
however, implies his reluctance to accept challenges—challenges that, though they may lead to
failure, ultimately help good players grow into great ones. Wanting the attention and deferring
your responsibilities to others when faced with pressure does not ﬁt my description ofthe league’s

JONA'l‘llAN GUEST

Is Lebron Iames this season’s NBA MVP?

Andrew and Jonathan decide if King James

deserves his Crown

Chris Paul, on the other hand, has invigorated an entire franchise through his leadership.
As a point guard should, Paul masterfully sets up teammates in their preferred positions on offense
while taking over the scoring load when his team needs it. He also paces himself throughout the
game so that he excels in the fourth quarter. Because of Paul, the Clippers have become a legiti-
mate contender after so many years as the laughingstock of the NBA.

It is true that Paul’s statistics do not compare to James’s. Lebron ﬁlls out the stat sheet _
every night like he is playing in a video game. His abilities on both offense and defense are amaz-
ing. Yet against the best teams in the league this season, Lebron has failed to make any statements
of intent by dominating those games. This implies that while we try to ignore Lebron’s shortcom-
ings in last season’s Finals when deciding this year’s MVP, James has not shown enough to sug-
gest that his incredible numbers are all that meaningful.

James’s domination of regular seasons and subsequent postseason struggles force ana-
lysts to decide how much context they should consider when choosing an MVP. While it may not
be fair to do so, it is hard not to have some skepticism surrounding Lebron’s success this season,
when in the past he has had so much difﬁculty with handling Playoff pressure. From this perspec-
tive, his impressive statistics seem shallow. For a historical analogy, think of Karl Malone winning
the MVP over Michael Jordan in 1998. Malone may have had bettertnumbers, but it did not seem
quite right; given their reputations, almost everyone would have bet their mortgage on MJ beating
Malone in the Finals. In that case, which player is really more valuable?

That consideration leads me to the ﬁnal factor in choosing the MVP: deﬁning “most
valuable”. I think that the term means more than impressive statistics._ Voters should think about
how essential a player is to his team. Without Chris Paul, the Clippers would be near the bottom
of the Western Conference. With him, they are the West’s 4-seed in the Playoffs. The Heat would
also suffer without James, but they also have Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh to pick up the slack.
Moreover, Paul is a ﬁery competitor and natural ﬁoor general. If I were in an NBA foxhole, I
would want Paul rather than James by my side. For this reason, I would choose Chris Paul as the

3 point percentage.

should.

The most common argument put forth in support of the decision for Rose involved his league
leading record at 62-20. However, it is hard to ignore the 58-24 Miami Heat who garnered 11 more wins
than the previous year without J ames. So the case rests on the four game lead of the NBA’s top team
over the 2nd place ﬁnishers. This is troubling for two reasons: V

First of all, it is no secret that given the grueling 82-game regular season and with the elusive
' NBA title being the primary goal, it is in the best interests of teams who have already clinched playoff
berths to slow down and rest their big-guns in the weeks leading up to the playoffs. As a result, there
must be seeds of skepticism present in any analysis that places any weight in late-season outcomes. And
further, the Heat’s dismissal of the Bulls in 5 games to claim the Eastern Conference Title (including 4
straight wins) lends support to the notion that the Bulls were not even the better team.

The unfortunate reality behind the Derrick Rose MVP award (and several others) is that the
criteria have become subjective. Not only is there no clariﬁcation as to what it means to be the Most
Valuable player, but those who are trusted to make an objective evaluation of the best players have
allowed their personal biases and partiality toward underdogs and feel-good—stories to obstruct their
professionalism. In the wake of “The Decision,” several people longed for a James failure. NBA fans
were disgusted with his sense of entitlement and his indifference toward the well being of any particular
franchise, especially his “hometown” Cavaliers. I get that. But when we start choosing the award based
on who we like rather than who deserves to win we sacriﬁce the award’s integrity and stain the achieve-
ments ofNBA greats from years past. Lebron James has been the best player in the NBA for the past 4
years. He is certainly the most valuable player in the league. If he doesn’t get the trophy, then nobody

Th‘e NBA’s “Most Valuable Player” award is the ultimate testament
to the accomplishment of a basketball player. While for many NBA
success is effectively synonymous with NBA championship rings, it is
hard to imagine a deﬁnition of successful by which Karl Malone and
Charles Barkley are inferior to Chauncey Billups . Because basketball
is a team game, less talent fused with superior chemistry often trumps
individual dominance. As a result, any answer to the question: “who is
the NBA’s best player?” requires a great deal of speculation. It is the
understanding of many (including myself) that this designation is the»
responsibility of the NBA analysts, sportswriters, and broadcasters who
vote each April to determine which player will be crowned “MVP”.

If you accept the common belief that NBA MVP is the best play-
er, then in recent years you may have been rather surprised with the
winners. For example, it is hard to make a case for any player outside
of Kobe Bryant in any year between 2005 and 2008. Yet, his single
Podoloff Trophy suggests otherwise. Similarly, Derrick Rose’s 2011
MVP award ﬂew in the face of a Lebron James campaign that apart from a minor drop in blocks per
game and a spike in ﬁeld goal percentage form 48.9% to 51.0% was essentially a statistical replica of his
MVP performance 2 years prior. Compared with Rose’s numbers, the James advantage is unmistakable.
James bested Rose in points, averaged 3.4 more rebounds, and averaged 0.6 more steals. Most notably
however, James held the edge in ﬁeld goal percentage by a full 6.5%. Rose (a point guard) averaged 0.7
more assists, shot 10% better from the free throw line, and held a statistically insigniﬁcant advantage in

Generals break three ODAC Championship Meet records among four ﬁrst-place ﬁnishes

By Catherine Tinney
STA F F W RIT E R

At the end of Spring Break,
both the men’s and‘women’s track teams
placed third at the Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference Championships hosted
by Lynchburg.

On the men’s side, Lynchburg
won with 216 points, and Bridgewater

‘took second with 122 points. Washing-

ton and Lee ﬁnished the two-day meet
with 75 points.

W&L was led by the strong
performances of sophomores Zander
Tallman and Dillon Myers.

Tallman won both the 200 and
400 meter dashes. He ran the 400 in

48.46 seconds and then came back to run
the 200 in an ODAC championship meet
record time of 21.56 seconds. Tallman
was also a member the 4x 1 00 meter relay
that placed second. The relay, consisting
of Tallman, fellow sophomores Agustin
Kim and Parker Howard, and ﬁrst-year
Aaron Jeong, got the baton around the
track in a time of 42.82 seconds.

Myers scored in ﬁve differ-
ent events. He took home second place
in the 400 meter hurdles with a time of
54.90 seconds. He ﬁnished fourth in the
highjump with a leap of 1.86 meters. He
also took home three different ﬁfth place

ﬁnishes. Myers placed ﬁfth in the long
jump with a mark of 6.37 meters, the
triplejump with ajump of 12.61 meters,
and thejavelin with a throw of49.37 me-
ters.

1 Leading the way for the wom-
en’s team was senior Natalie Stier and
ﬁrst-years Janey Fugate and Jillian Kat-
terhagen.

Stier, competing in the last
meet of her career, came in ﬁfth in the
steeplechase in a time of 12:46.88. This
was just the second time she had ever
run the event. Stier also placed second in
the 400 intermediate hurdles. This time

is signiﬁcant, as the 2010 champ in the
event ran 1:05.45.

First-year Janey Fugate was
the lone competitor to defeat Stier, com-
pleting the race in an ODAC champion-
ship meet record time of 1:04.41.

Stier and Fugate were also
members of the 4x100 and 4x400 meter
team. The 4x100 meter placed second.
Stier and Fugate were joined by junior
Marissa Thompson and sophomore Julia
Murray. They were able to get the ba-
ton around the track cleanly in a time of
50.17 seconds.

W&L makes it to ODAC tournament ﬁnals after defeating the second and third seeds

By Leigh Dannhauser
sPoRTs EDITOR

Washington and Lee’s men’s lacrosse
team continues to surprise the Old Do-
minion.Ath1etic Conference. The sixth
seed has upset two back-to—back oppo-
nents in the lose-and-go-home champi-
onship tournament.

On Wednesday W&L played third
ranked Hampton-Sydney in the quarter-
ﬁnal game. They held a 6-2 lead in the
second quarter and were able to hold off

a comeback attempt to win 9-8.

First-years Cam Lewis and Garrett
Paglia, and junior Jack Switala led the
way for the Generals with two goals
apiece. First-year Warren Berenis played
the entire game in the net with ﬁve saves.

W&L then faced off with second seed
Roanoke in the ODAC semiﬁnal game
on Saturday.

The game was close in the first half.

The Generals jumped out to a 2-0 lead
but then the Maroons were able to tie
the score up at 3 all by the end of the
ﬁrst quarter with the help of two goals
byjunior Richard Lachlan. Senior Scoot
Meehan then scored four of his game-
high ﬁve goals in the second quarter. The
Generals entered halftime leading 8-6.
It was a lead that they would not relin-
quish.

There was a lull in the scoring during
the third quarter, but the Generals were
able to tack on two more goals to their
lead and were up 10-6 entering the ﬁnal
quarter of the game.

Roanoke was unable to make a dent
in W&L’s lead.

Over the course of the game Roanoke
took 56 shots compared to W&L’s 32.
Only 50% of Roanoke’s shots were on

Men and women each go 5-0 in the ODAC Championship Finals

By Leigh Dannhauser
spoars EDITOR

Both the men’s and women’s tennis
teams took home the Old Dominion Ath-

' letic Conference crowns on Sunday.

The men cruised through the tourna-
ment throughout the week. This contin-
ued in their match versus Bridgewater
College for the ODAC title. Washington
and Lee won the match 5-0.

The Generals started off the day by
sweeping the doubles’ matches. The

duos of junior Hayden White and ﬁrst-
year Taylor Shamshiri and seniors Mac
Davis and Brian Roberts defeated their
respective Eagles opponents by a score

' of 8-4. Seniors Jeremy Becht and Ben

Fass defeated the pair of ﬁrst-year Chris-
tian Lynn and junior Peter Hawkins by a
score of 8-3.

W&L easily won the ﬁrst two singles
matches to be contested to seal the vic-

4

tory. Roberts defeated sophomore Sam
Churchill in two games 6-2, 6-4. Fass
earned a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Lynn.

Similarly, the women’s team had a
similarly easy time winning the ODAC
title versus Hollins. The women swept
the doubles’ matches and won the ﬁrst
two singles’ matches.

Sophomore Cameron Dorsey and
senior Jen Snyder won the number one

doubles match 8-1, while seniors Lauren
Lukas and Treslie Sadler defeated soph-
omore Priscila Montoya and her sister,
junior Karen Montoya, in the number
two match. In the number three doubles
match, ﬁrst-years Sonja Meighan and
Meghan Buell defeated ﬁrst-years Sarah
McCormick and Victoria Coffee 8-0.

In the two singles matches that were
played, the Generals won 6-0, 6-0. Dors-

school record breaking 4x400 meter re-
lay with Stier and Fugate. The trio was
joined by sophomore Lauren Woodie.

Katterhagen took home gold in
the pole vault with a leap of 3.35 meters.

Junior Taylor Maxey also had a
record setting day. She broke the school
record in the hammer with a toss of
37.09 meters.

The season is over for most
of the members of both the men’s and
women’s teams. However, select mem-
bers of each team are still competing to
try and qualify for the national meet be-
ginning May 17th in Claremont, Ca.

minutes in goal.

W&L will play top seeded Lynchburg
in the ﬁnals next Sunday, May 6. The
game begins at 1pm.

ey defeated senior Trudy Sizaba and
Buell defeated senior Shawnte Woodson.

Athletic Conference Championships.

Leading the Generals was ﬁrst-year Char-
lotte Keesler and senior Tamara Morse, who
ﬁnished fourth and ninth, respectively.

Keesler ﬁnished the day with 80.5 points.
At the end of the day she was also awarded
with ODAC Rookie of the Year honors.

Morse ﬁnished ninth with 77 points. She

was named the ODAC/ Farm Bureau Insur-
ance Scholar-Athlete of the Year.

Rounding out the scoring for Washing-
ton and Lee was junior Molly Rountree who
ﬁnished 14th with 71 points and sophomore
Maia Robbins who ﬁnished 24th with 49.75
points.

As a team the Generals scored 9 points.
Sweet Briar took home the title with 16 points,
with Hollins ﬁnished in second close behind

them with 15 points. Randolph was third with
10 points. »

While the season is done for most of the
riders, Morse has qualiﬁed for Nationals.
She will be competing in the ﬁat competition
event at Nationals in Raleigh, N.C. starting
May 3rd.

From Olympics to Div.|ll

Gwen Alexander inspires athletes wit her passion

By Christina Benedetti
STA F F W R I TE R

“Five, four, three, two, one. . .STOP!” Pre-
season was hotter than usual and steam rose
from the newly laid ﬁeld hockey turfscorching
the girls’ feet as they played. It is always ten
degrees warmer than what the thermometer
reads when playing on the artiﬁcial turf. The
coach, looking at the girls who were sweating
and panting, asked, “How many goals did you
make?” The girls exchanged nervous glances
and admitted that they didn’t know that they
were supposed to count. The coach bellowed,
“Ten pushups, now! If you don’t count, how
are you supposed to know if you beat the other
group?” Even on day one of practice, a two
minute shooting drill was a competition.

Gwen Alexander joined Washington and
Lee University’s ﬁeld hockey program as a
voluntary coach in 2010. While she and her
husband, Chuck, moved to Lexington to care
for their sick aunt, both soon found coaching
opportunities in the area. Chuck found work
as a track coach for the Virginia Military In-
stitute, while Gwen set her sights on the W&L
team. Gwen asked W&L head coach Wendy
Orrison if she could join the team as a goalie
coach. Wendy welcomed her on board, but
was unable to place her on the payroll because
there was already a full time assistant coach.
Despite the lack of payment, Gwen was ec-
static to continue her involvement in the sport
that she loves.

Gwen contributed immediately by revamp-
ing the team’s defense. As the team adjusted
well to the new defensive strategy, the play-
ers and the coaches struggled to understand
her personality and competitive drive. In
women’s Division III athletics, an in-your-
face coaching style is uncommon. However,
Gwen embraces this style and is not afraid to
let the team or an individual know when they:
are not working at their highest rate. Gwen
will never allow the team to give up or settle
on play that is less than its potential. Almost
every player has at once heard, “Hey! You can
run faster than that!” directed at them. Anna
Katharine Barnes, a ﬁrst-year for the Gener-
als, reﬁects, “Once you get past Gwen’s in-
tensity as a coach, her competitive spirit is
extremely inspiring and motivating.”

“Thankful circle”. is a long upheld tradi-
tion that the ﬁeld hockey team proudly car-
ries out. Before each home game, the team
gathers in the locker-room for pregame ritu-
als. Each individual has the opportunity to
say something that she is thankful for. The
purpose of “thankful circle” is to remind the
players to keep things in perspective, that it
is just a game. ‘‘I’m thankful for my fam-
ily and the beautiful weather”, “l’m thank-
ful for my health”, and ‘‘I’m thankful for my

’ friends and the opportunity to play athletics

in college” are common responses from team-
mates. However, Gwen has never varied her
response: “I am thankful for the competition.”

Gwen Cheeseman was born on August 13,
l95l and grew up in rural Central Pennsylva-
nia. Growing up with ﬁve siblings, Gwen was
exposed to competition early on. Her father,
a stonemason, was a perfectionist, but knew
how to make hard work fun, while her mother
showed her love for competition in herjob as

Thursday

a schoolteacher. Gwen’s brothers and sisters
constantly played with one another and com-
peted in everything that they did, including
dinner. “Who’s going to get the last drum-
stick??”, she said. As Gwen thinks of her
childhood, the memories of winning a soft-
ball throw competition in elementary school
replay vividly in her mind. Even at an early
age, Gwen recognized that she felt satisfac-
tion from competing. To Gwen, “Winning is
tremendous”.

And she“thankful for the competition.”

Field hockey was introduced into Gw-
en’s life the summer before she entered high
school. The ﬁrst time she saw the game, she
instantly knew that she wanted to be a goalie.
While most teams resort to begging someone
to play the position, Gwen willingly placed
herself in the path of speeding, rock hard ﬁeld
hockey balls because she said “it looked fun”.
Just like anything else in Gwen’s life, she
devoted all of her time and effort to her ﬁeld
hockey skills. With three years head-to—head
experience on the varsity squad, Gwen was
recruited and played on West Chester Univer-
sity’s team. '

‘In 1980, Gwen’s life goals took a new di-
rection. For the ﬁrst time in Olympic history,
women’s ﬁeld hockey qualiﬁed asan Olym-
pic event. From that moment on, Gwen’s
new goal was to qualify for the national team.

Training over ﬁve hours per day, Gwen set her =
sights on an Olympic medal. Four years lat-

er, in Los Angeles, California, Gwen and her
teammates were presented with the opportu-
nity to take home the bronze medal.

In 1984, Olympic women’s ﬁeld hockey
played in a round robin format with head to
head competition. Goals for and goals against
would determine the fate of a tie. As Gwen
watched the Dutch play the Aussies, she cal-
culated that if the Dutch won exactly 2-0, the
bronze medal would be determined by penalty
strokes. In ﬁeld hockey, penalty strokes con-
sist of two sets of ﬁve strokes. The goalies on
opposing teams would switch on and off until
the score presented a winner. Looking at the
clock tick down under 1 minute, Gwen real-
ized the score was exactly 2-0. She hustled
down to the ﬁeld to practice strokes before
she would have to defend the penalty shots for
real. She was thankﬁil that she had awakened
at Sam that morning to practice strokes with
another anxious teammate who couldn’t sleep
either. With her family in the stands, Gwen
saved the ﬁrst three balls, and with goals of
her teammates, was able to clench the bronze
medal. Gwen said, “After twelve years of
training, winning the Bronze Medal was very
rewarding. It was like Disneyland!”

Goalies are at a clear disadvantage during
penalty strokes. Gwen recalls that people of-
ten expressed to her how hard it must be for a
goalie to defend them. Gwen would explain
that in fact, she loved defending strokes be-
cause she loved the challenge. She knew that
it usually took a mistake on the offensive side
for her to save the goal, but the challenge was
incredibly fun and rewarding for her when she
did. I guess that’s how you become an Olym-
pian. . .looking to challenges as something you

will enjoy because you have the opportunity
to overcome them.

“I am thankful for the competition.”

Having been a Division I and an Olympic
athlete, Division III ﬁeld hockey is a radical
change from the level of competition that
Gwen is used to. When asked about the dif-
ference, Gwen said, “The commitment was
more at Division I: more hours in the weight
room, more physical conditioning, and more
time playing on the ﬁeld.” Head ﬁeld hockey
coach Wendy Orrison commends Gwen for
adjusting to the Division III level and her role
as an assistant coach. Although the competi-
tion may be less, Gwen says, “It is rewarding
to coach both DI and DIII because it is helping
a group to achieve their goals and dreams”.

Gwen’s competitive attitude has helped
the team and many individuals push harder
than they ever would have thought possible.
Sophomore defender Victoria Van Natten says
that “Gwen helps me to be competitive with
myself, to push my teammates, and to try to
achieve my maximum potential.” Assistant
coach Jane Beall claims that Gwen’s inﬂu-
ence does not end on the ﬁeld. She thinks that
having someone who models a healthy com-
petitive attitude is beneﬁcial for the players to
witness a strong, driven woman who derives
satisfaction from earning a win. Jane says,
“It’s helpﬁil for them to implement that ﬁght-
ing spirit on the ﬁeld, and in life, when they
will have to advocate for themselves in the
real world that is far more competitive than
any hockey game.”

Although the level of play between Divi-
sion I and Division III may seem drastically
different, to Gwen, competition is competi-
tion. This past fall, Gwen’s husband suffered
from a heart attack and was hospitalized for
over a month. While Gwen was absent from
games and practices in order to tend‘ to her
husband Chuck, the lack of intensity and com-
petition was evident among the players and
the coaches. At Gwen’s ﬁrst game back, when
it came time for “thankful circle,” Gwen was
not thankﬁil for her husband or any of the doc-
tors working to nurse Chuck back to health,
but instead Gwen looked around the room and
said in a clear and steady voice, “I am thankﬁil
for the competition”.

Bent talks Da Vinci and anatomy

Professor George Bent explains how Leonardo da Vinci was both an artist and a scientist

ByTommy Kent
STAFF wmrea

Professor George Bent discussed how
Da Vinci’s artistic ability beneﬁted from
his study of anatomy, and vice versa last
Wednesday in the Northen Auditorium.

Bent, an Art History Professor at
Washington and Lee, gave the Sidney
Gauss Childress Professorship Inaugural
Lecture entitled, “Art into Science, Sci-
ence into Art:

who attended with his family.

In the lecture, Bent emphasized how
Da Vinci’s virtuosity in the arts and deep
scientiﬁc knowledge were never—before-
seen complements when applied to ana-
tomical studies in that time.

Da Vinci, according to Bent, was a
famous artist whose services were cov-
eted for personal enjoyment. Among his

2*’ patrons, Da Vinci served Ludovico, the
/’ Duke of Milan, for 17 years, paint-

\

.... "

Leonardo da Vinci and the Body.”
This professorship, W&L’s ﬁrst dedi-
cated solely to the arts, was established
through a gift by J. Donald Childress ’70

  

\ ing “The Last Supper” and
\ others, sculpting, design-
ing buildings, improving
sanitation and hygiene in
the city, creating weap-
ons of mass destruc-
tion, and beginning

\ his initial study of

human anatomy.

Bent, referring

to Da Vinci as the

/ “left-handed bastard”

1 (as. he was born out
of wedlock), said that

Da Vinci’s “anatomi-

/ cal studies were so ef-
 fective because he was an
 artist.” Bent said Da Vin-
ci’s gifts as a scientist also

~ alluded [his followers].

Da Vinci, according to

Bent, worked in a Flor-

ence hospital in I500 and spent hours
studying, meeting patients, and think-
ing about the hospital’s mission. At one
point, Da Vinci conducted an autopsy

on the body of a I00-year-old man and
discovered the cause of death to be hard-
ening of the arteries, allegedly the ﬁrst
diagnosis of arteriosclerosis. Bent esti-
mated that Da Vinci conducted at least
30 autopsies throughout his life. Not
only that, but apparently to get a good
understanding of an organ or section of
the body Da Vinci believed cutting from
the front, side and back was necessary.

Da Vinci’s foray into the study of
human anatomy was extraordinary for
many reasons. Bent said, “Autopsies
and human dissections weren’t all that
common in Christian Europe. Even on
the rare occasion when dissection was
recorded for posterity, it was not for edu-
cation but to record who it was and what
portion of the event.”

Additionally, Bent said that ﬁrst,
Christians did not condone cutting up
corpses, and no physician had been
trained to draw with any kind of ﬂuency.
The promary reason forced Da Vinci
to abandon his anatomical studies for
good when a German spy reported his
work to the Pope during the period from
l5l3-l5l6 that Da Vinci was working in
Rome. The second did not apply to Da
Vinci who had unmatched artistic skill.

Throughout the lecture, Bent showed
several detailed anatomical drawings by
Da Vinci, including the heart, the skull,
and muscles in the arms. sex organs. and
even a fetus in the uterus, the ﬁrst of
such kind and signifying that he had cut
into a pregnant woman, “something just

not done in [Da Vinci’s] day,” said Bent.

Bent said that Da Vinci believed his
drawings could help educate physicians
without putting them at risk of persecu-
tion and that they would enable detailed
study instead of only ﬂeeting study dur-
ing an actual autopsy. Da Vinci’s adage,
“the only way to know something was to
ﬁnd it out yourself”, followed in his ac-
tions and boundless curiosity. Bent said
that Da Vinci, among many other things,
wondered about the science of reproduc-
tion and thought about the spinal cord
and the head. Bent also said, “We can
see that the engineer in him saw that the
arm worked by pulley systems.”

Bent said that Da Vinci rejected the
notion that he was either one or the oth-
er: artist or scientist. Bent said, “He was
one of the most important interdisciplin-
ary thinkers in history.”

Bent showed the concurrent influence
of art on Da Vinci’s anatomical explora-
tions and of his study of anatomy on his
art, by explaining how Da Vinci’s por-
traits and depictions of the human body
became more sophisticated and real af-
ter he had worked to understand human
anatomy. According to Bent, Da Vinci,
who believed that the two objectives
of the artist were to show the outward
appearance of human beings and to re-
veal intention and intellectual motives,
“found the key to represent the human
ﬁgure so accurately.”

He went on to elaborate that “The art-
ist painterly style began to shift after an-

79

atomical studies. By showing Da Vin-
ci’s painting titled “St. Jerome Praying
in the Wilderness”, Bent exhibited how
Da Vinci’s understanding of anatomy
allowed him to satisfy not only the art-
ist’s ﬁrst objective, but also the second:
“straining muscles” can give a glimpse
into the inner motives of the ﬁgure.

Da Vinci’s “anatomical fidelity”
makes the painting “that much more be-
lievable and that much more powerful.”
explained Bent. “It causes the features
to strike us more dramatically. Figures
began to become representations of all
humanity.”

Essentially, the painter, mathema-
tician, engineer, and scientist within
Da Vinci all worked together to create
“breathtakingly beautiful” works of art.
Bent said, “The history of art was altered
by Da Vinci’s scientiﬁc gifts. The his-
tory of science was jumpstarted by Da
Vinci’s artistic gifts.”

In closing, Bent said, “The body is a
microcosm that matches the broader uni-
verse all around us. Leonardo da Vinci
provided the ﬁrst real window into the
universe that each one of us has within
us.”

Barth discusses concussions

Dr Jeﬂrey Barth describes what scientists need to do to better understand how to treat concussions

By Graham Colton
STAF F WRITE R

Last Wednesday, Dr. Jeffrey T. Barth
spoke on “Sports and Combat Concus-
sion: Assessment, Intervention, and Re-
turn to Play/Duty.”

A member of the National Football
League Players Association Mackey-
White Traumatic Brain Injury Commit-
tee and Director of the University of
Virginia’s Neurocognitive Assessment
Laboratory, Barth said that scientists
must “think, observe, and talk with peo-
ple” about concussions to provide better
treatment for concussed athletes and sol-
diers.

Citing his research from the 1982
Wall Street Journal article, “Mild Head
Injury: The Silent Epidemic,” Barth fo-

« cused ﬁrst on assessing concussions. In

addition to conﬁision, nausea, or vomit,
concussed persons may show more se-
vere, long-terrn symptoms like retro-
grade amnesia and/or posttraumatic am-
nesia. Whereas a retrogradevamnesiac
forgets events preceding the concussion,
Barth said, a posttraumatic amnesiac
cannot begin to remember post-concus-
sion events until the amnesia subsides.
In an experiment early in his career,
Barth tested primatesto determine the
extent of “axonal degeneration induced

by experimental noninvasive minor head
injury.” Replicating high-speed col-
lisions on the football ﬁeld, some pri-
mates wore helmets that “would...move
forward very quickly and stop,” said
Barth. Others did not. All of the pri-
mates’ brains, however, looked normal.

Later in his professional life, Barth
and his colleagues at UVA started using
Sports as a Laboratory Assessment Mod-
el (SLAM) to, as Dr. Barth said, “focus
on concussion as a laboratory for clinical
research.” By applying mild traumatic
brain injury (MTBI) research to the gen-
eral population, Barth sought to establish
“baseline neurocognitive assessments in
sports.” After testing 2,350 players from
ten universities, he found that “healthy,
young, motivated athletes” exhibited
“cognitive deﬁcits...aﬁer a very mild
concussion.”

Conﬁrmed by later high school, col-
legiate, and professional studies nation-
wide, Barth and his research team found
that it typically takes between three to
ten days to recover from only a mild
concussion.

Directly, after a concussion, Barth
recommended that athletic trainers use
a Standardized Assessment of Concus-

sions (SAC) test to correctly diagnose
symptoms. As well as proposing three
computerized assessments of accelera-
tion-deceleration concussions, Barth of-
fered three scales to grade the severity of
a concussion.

The retum—to-play decision, though,
is less certain. “In this era of evidence-
based medicine,” Barth said, “those who
must make critical retum—to-play deci-
sions are left in the unenviable position
of choosing between scientism or poten-
tial charlatanism.” In other words, when
deciding if and when an athlete should
return to play, the athletic trainer must
strike a balance between protecting the
athlete’s well-being and returning her/
him to the ﬁeld of play.

These difﬁcult decisions are further
complicated by second-impact syndrome
(SIS), a “catastrophic increase in intra-
cranial pressure due to dysfunction of
autoregulation of cerebral circulation.”
SIS “most often occurs in athletes less
than 24-years-old” who have sustained a
“prior concussion following a relatively
minor second impact.”

Similarly, players in high-contact
sports such as football and boxing are
especially prone to Chronic Traumatic

U

Encephalopathy (CTE), which is a “de-
generative neurological condition” that,
like SIS, afflicts adolescent athletes. If
competitors overlook SIS and CTE by
returning to play too early, then they
risk reactive depression, sub-concussive
blows, and acute and chronic cognitive
deﬁcits.

Although he said that there are not
any hard-and-fast rules to concussion
treatment, Barth displayed a diagram of
the Xenith football helmet, an innovative
measure to prevent MTBIS. In this hel-
met, he stated, there are “essentially air-
bags [that] have a valve in the bottom, so
that when they...are compressed down,
they can go all the way down because
there’s a nozzle that lets the air out.”

Despite the doubt clouding retum—to-
play decisions, medical scientists at least
know the effects of an initial MTBI.
First, according to Barth, a “single un-
complicated concussion often results in
acute neurocognitive and balance deﬁ-
cits.” Second, he said that “the risk [for
another concussion]...increases three to
six-fold” after the ﬁrst concussion.

In his closing remarks, Barth ad-
dressed the even greater dangers from
concussions that soldiers face at war. By

causing primary, tertiary, and quaternary

injuries, blasts from Improvised Explo-
sive Devices (IEDS) result in complica-
tions “very different than what we see in
sports injuries,” including but not limited
to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
and complex neurocognitive damage.

Notwithstanding accurate assessment
or interventions like rest, observation,
and information provision, a concussion
suffered on the battleﬁeld--like one on
the gridiron--cannot be treated like any
other before it. Instead, healthcare pro-
fessionals must “get comfortable with
ambiguity,” Barth said. “Every player is
different and decisions should be made
by the medical/athletic training staff
(and the player), taking individual his-
tory into account,” he said.

All downhill after

Annie Persons suggests that students approach life after graduation

During a

she believed
adulthood

best years of
her life so far.
Time stood still

things and I

exchanged ex-
pressions of mingled shock and amuse-
ment that can only happen amongst stu-
dents in a classroom. You know, that look
that says, “Okayyyyyy.” Clearly picking
up on this, our professor explained that
she enjoyed her 205, but found that life

early 20-some- ‘

actually “peaked when [she] hit 30.”
Now, when was the last time you
heard someone say that? In my experi-
ence it has been the opposite; I recall
countless relatives at my high school
graduation luncheon approaching me in
their cloudy mid—aftemoon buzz to la-
ment how lucky I was to be starting col-

away from home in a bubble of essen-
tially endless opportunities for fun and
enjoyment. I think we can all agree that
college is the perfect amalgam of just
enough responsibility to make you feel
as though you have a purpose, but also
not enough stress to hinder any shenani-
gans or general merriment that may arise

Like the old adage, “attitude is everything’

)

who

says college ever has to end?

lege, how these next four years would
be the absolute best of my life, etc. etc.
And, well, given my experiences fresh-
man year, I can’t say I blame them. Sure,
the work has been tough at times (some-
times really tough), but the big picture
is that few things are better than living

to punctuate your school work. Put more
simply, I live in a big building ﬁlled with
my best friends and no adults. Oh, and
class can be pretty interesting sometimes
too.

Clearly, then, Professor .Wheeler is
just an outlier. “How could adulthood

51”

possibly be better than college?,” I asked
myself resolutely, mentally shivering as
the beast of looming adulthood reared
his ugly head in my direction.

But then I started thinking...maybe
it isn’t about where you are in life, but
how you act about where you are. Like
the old adage, “attitude is everything”-—
who says college ever has to end? Now,
don’t get me wrong, I’m not suggest-
ing that you treat your future business
cocktail parties as the perfect setting to
throw back a few shots and start a game
of shandies. What I am saying is that you
treat the rest of your life with the same
attitude you treat your life in college.
For example, by accepting responsibil-
ity, but not taking the stupid stuff too se-
riously. Knowing what is and_what isn’t
stupid stuff when it comes to academics

or your job. Knowing the difference be-‘

tween a night when you should go out
and let loose, and a night when you

aduation?  

e same way that they approach life in college

should stay in with your friends, hus-
band/wife, or even a good movie. Know-
ing how to go out and let loose without
caring what other people think, but also
knowing how to maintain a good repu-
tation. Taking your superiors (professor,
boss, etc.) seriously, but with a grain of
salt—they’re human too. Taking life se-
riously, but not too seriously.

Put another way: a few nights ago
,my friend handed me a curly pink straw
to use in my drink. I couldn’t help but
exclaim, “Wow, this really tastes better
through a bendy straw!” ...and it was
true. Let your attitude about life be a
bendy straw. Sip things slowly, enjoy
them, ﬁnd the fun in life. Let growing
up and graduating be about ﬁnding your
bendy straw to make the rest of your
days, not just your 203, taste a little bet-
ter.

How to write an opinions article

Senior Stockton Bullitt, former Opinions Editor and columnist extraordinaire, oﬂers advice in his ﬁnal contribution

When I read
Georgia Rob-
ertson’s opin-

ions article on
Greek fratemi—
ties on campus,
I was incensed.
Yes, it has been
a while since I
have written a
quality article
for the Phi, and
yes, I am in a
somewhat com-
promised posi-
tion to write a
fraternity review column. But still, the
whole fraternity review spiel was kind
of my thing. Therefore, I could not have
been more delighted to see the onslaught
of criticism this column took. Georgia
did not say anything original, nor did she
actually do anything libelous, so why
were students, parents and alumni (okay,
it seemed to only be students speaking
for parents and alumni, but I’ll just throw
them in there) so enraged at the publica-
tion of this speciﬁclcolumn? Seriously, I
wrote about the quality of the Four Loco,
the merits of pledgeship and argued that
the J-School is erroneous, and l’ve only
gotten two or three Letters to the Editor.
This chick gets a whole issue of the Phi
dedicated completely to her plagiarized
idea. What gives?

As I re-read the column, I started to

   

 Stu-clcto miin

so much. The article is an example of in-
credibly bad writing. Georgia Robertson
may go to a liberal arts school, but her
composition leaves much to be desired.
So, as a response, I thought I would tell
Georgia, and anyone else who is inter-
ested, how to actually write a quality
opinions article for The Ring-tum Phi.

there was hardly a real opinion in the en-
tire article. Oh, Fiji has nice guys. Great!
Everyone already knows that. This is the
main reason why so many people were
so mad at the article. Georgia wasn’t
clever enough to think of ways that these
stereotypes play out in everyday lives,
nor did she think that the W&L commu-

Yes, we would all like to be Owen Wilson ﬂom
“Marley and Me, "’ but we really don ’t own that
many pets and our personal lives aren ’t that inter-

esting to other people.

This is not a complete list of how to
write; instead, it’s more of a list of guide-
lines to think about while writing an arti-
cle for The Ring-tum Phi. Make sure that
you do not use these guidelines for any-
thing else besides writing an opinions ar-
ticle forThe Ring-tum Phi, because they
don’t work in many other circumstances.

To prepare, I re-read every single
opinions article in the year 2012. I did
this because I am running the Spring
Term option, and frankly, my life is rath-
er boring once you take out the alcohol.
Interestingly, I did not ﬁnd as much dirt
as I would have hoped. Lately, the qual-
ity of writing in the opinions section has
gotten better and not worse. As a former

writing an opin-
ion’s article is to
think about the
reader. Yes, you
should already
know this, but just
in case you didn’t,
this is critical to
writing opinions.
The Phi is dis-
tributed to certain
people who all
feel certain ways
about the school.
You are pandering
to them, not the
other way around.
So, onto the ten

BRIAN SIMPSON guidelines!
KANE THOMAS 1, Actually
Have an Opinion
This is the most
important guide-

line. Opinions are
NOT news. They
are views on what
people already
know about. Take
a stance and de-
fend the stance.
That is literally all
you need to do for
every opinions ar-
ticle. Unfortunate-
ly, this approach is
taken barely more
than half the time
in The Ring-tum
Phi. Writers get so
bogged down in
the “what” of their
articles that they
lose the “why.”
Looking at the
fraternity article,

nity was smart enough to already know
that these stereotypes exist. That’s why
she found it incumbent upon herself to
enlighten the community who is who.
Everyone was so pissed because a) they
already know who is who and b) there
is nothing new or interesting about read-
ing something you already know when
it’s presented in a straightforward fash-
ion. Georgia should have taken what she
knows about those stereotypes and used
them in some kind of comedic fashion.

Also, most articles that I tend to like
both read and write are ones that take un-
common opinions. We all know that girls
like Pinterest and Twitter contains many
narcissists, but I tend to like opinions
that go the other direction and take the
road less traveled. It usually makes for
a better read.

2. Minimize Your Own Life’s Story

Readers of the Ring Tum Phi prefer
anecdotes to stories. Just because the
Opinion writer is allowed to use the word
“I” in a story, this does not mean that he
or she should make the whole opinion
about him or herself. The reader does not
care about the personal life of the writer
unless it serves to prove a greater point.
Yes, we would all like to be Owen Wil-
son from “Marley and Me,” but we real-
ly don’t own that many pets and our per-
sonal lives aren’t that interesting to other
people. If the story is self-deprecating,
then maybe you can extend the story, but
for the most part, people hate the articles
that are simply vehicles to tell one’s own
life story. By doing that, you are making
the article about yourself, and the article
is always about the reader. ‘ I

Likewise, never talk about the actual
process of writing the opinion article. If
your intro has something along the lines
of “As I sat at my computer thinking of
what to write...” you should just transfer
to Roanoke College and accept that you
will always be on a lower intelligence
level than the majority of W&L students.

3. Boys are Different than Girls

Glad we got that out of the way.

By the way, it is not an embarrass-
ment to girls that a girl wrote an article
about fraternities. Betty Friedan is not
turning over in her grave because some-
one took a big swing and a miss. Geor-
gia, like many other people on campus,
just did not recognize the social norms
governing our institution. For example,
I can never nor will I ever write a soror-
ity review article. Does it have anything
to do with gender equality on campus?
Hell no. Guys and girls at W&L and ev-
erywhere for that matter are inherently
equal. That’s just the deal. We wrote it
a couple hundred years ago on a piece
of paper and qualiﬁed it somewhat a
hundred years ago. But, girls are differ-
ent than guys. Frats don’t watch El, and
srats don’t watch Spike. Not that tough.

You can write articles making fun of fra-
ternities because that’s mostly carefree
and fun, but when you do the same thing
with sororities, problems tend to occur.

Lastly, speaking as a male, can we
please cut down on the number of fash-
ion opinion articles that come out every
week? Hearing about problems with
Barbour and leggings is like hearing
women defend Khloe Kardashian. I’m
just asking.

4. How to Curse

There is a certain mindset you need to
use with cursing when writing an opin-
ions article. The readers of The Ring-
tum Phi are mostly college students or
adults trying to tap into the mindset of
college students, so, when writing, you
must sound like a college student be-
cause your readers want the vernacular.
If they did not want the vernacular, they
would buy the “Wall Street Journal.” So,
make sure you throw in some shits and
douche bags just to appease the masses.
Otherwise, I don’t really like throwing
them in there if I can avoid it (I usually
can’t). Listen to what your professors
say,_ using a curse word just shows that
you lack the vocabulary and imagination
to use a proper word. So, stop being so
damned shitty with your thoughts, and
make sure you deﬁnitely avoid using the
f-bomb.

5. BEAT AROUND THE BUSH

Seriously, Georgia? I know that what
you did wasn’t illegal, but you directly
called groups of people predators, drug
users, homosexual, and douche bags. If
you or I did that at a party, there would
be bad consequences, like getting pushed
under Traveller consequences. That is to
say, there are predators, drug users and
douche bags on campus (there are also
homosexuals but lumping someone’s
sexuality with three bad things seems
pretty unfair), but they do not need to be
labeled in a public setting. So, instead of
pointing and shouting so everyone can
hear, Georgia should have done what
most writers do and that’s hide behind
someone’s back, refer to an indiscretion,
make a connection and snicker. In the lit-
erary world, they call this allusion. The
entire mess could have been avoided by
referencing stereotypes without directly
acknowledging them. ,

6. Appease Both Sides of W&L

W&L has two sets of students: stu-
dents who buy into the game of frater-
nities, sororities and the chutes and lad-
ders that accompany them and students
who aren’t godless heathens celebrating
a four-year Bacchanalia. Now, that may
be a bit of an exaggeration, but that is
not to say that those two sets of people
do not exist and that they have very dif-
ferent expectations from their opinions
articles. Many fraternity and sorority
members likewise are not into the “Who
is the best Greek member/afﬁliation?”
debate. These constituencies need to be
addressed and accurately critiqued if you

_ are going to write a fraternity or sorority

article (just kidding, you should never
write a sorority article).

And for that matter, appease the W&L
moms. Easily the most avid, intelligent
and beautiful readers associated with
The Ring-tum Phi (Did I mention they
have checkbooks?), the W&L moms
need to be considered when writing an
opinions article for The Ring-tum Phi.
You don’t need to think, “Will my moth-
er read this?” when writing an article be-
cause odds are she might, and she prob-
ably won’t care if you mention alcohol.’

But throw in a couple of mom jokes here
and there, like mentioning why there are
so many 29-year-old sisters coming to
campus on Parent’s Weekend, and you
will go far in life.

7. Keep in Mind that You Attend
W&L

This is a very socially conscious
school and putting your name on an ar-
ticle is a pretty ballsy move as is, but
people are going to remember what you
say about them, especially if it’s nega-
tive. Likewise, they will remember what
you say if you are unfairly positive about
a certain group of people. Since this isn’t
that groundbreaking of a topic, I’ll just
let this carry into the next guideline...

8. Live in Reality
From the fraternity article by Georgia
R.:

“While there are a fair share of jerks
in any frat, Beta seems to keep a low
concentration while still maintaining
fun party guys who aren’t overly cocky,
weird or nerdy.”

“I honestly could name probably
two Sig Eps and have never attended
or known someone who has attended a
party.”

“ till, you will be hard pressed to ﬁnd
a socially awkward Phi Psi.”

I think that pretty much covers it.

9. You are NOT a Deep Person

The articles that people tend to hate
most in the opinions section are the ones
that talk down to their readers. Geor-
gia made this problem by thinking that
people didn’t already know stereotypes
about fraternities, but it gets much worse.
Let’s be clear aboutone thing: no more
poems. What can be explained in broken
clauses with weird line breaks about how
much it sucks to be in a bad relationship
can surely be explained using full sen-
tences.and paragraphs. A poem is not
an opinion. It is an artistic expression
that should be in the Shenandoah. Fur-
thermore, make inside jokes that every-
one can understand. You will get much
further with your readers if you refer-
ence LeBron or Don Draper, not Imelda
Marcos. I mean, really? Imelda Marcos.
C’mon. By keeping the jokes and refer-
ences simple, the article will be more ac-
cessible and will actually get read.

Furthermore, do not cliche up the
place when your cliches don’t really
work. This election is not “one for the
history books” nearly as much as 2008,
2000, 1992, 1980, 1960, etc. Also, obvi-
ously this election is going in the history
books because every election goes into
the history books.

10. Grammar Gets You Laid

‘ “One last thing: Coke” is as atrocious
a sentence as you can get. Not only does
it royally piss off a boatload of people,
but it is also a fragment, a wrongly capi-
talized word and a raping of the colon,

.one of our most virginal punctuation

marks.

Make sure you follow Vampire
Weekend’s advice on the Oxford com-
ma.’ It is not used when writing articles
in newspapers. If you read enough of my
articles, you will notice that I learned
this about halfway through my career at
W&L. It’s a nice thing to know.

.So, Georgia and everyone else inter-
ested in writing opinions for the Ring-
tum Phi, use these guidelines wisely.
Fracois Hollande listened to me, and
look where he is.

Taming of the Shrew oes west  

Just “howdy ” you tame the shrew? The National Players present afresh new twist on the classic Shakespeare comedy

By Gabrielle Tremo
5 TA F F w R I T E R

This week, Washington and Lee’s
Keller Theater was graced with the
presence of the National Players. The
National Players, the longest running
touring company in America, performed
the Shakespeare classic The Taming of
the Shrew. Shrew, a play whose plot was
borrowed from the well-known movie
10 Things I Hate About You, details the
“wooing” of two women: Kate—the
shrew— and her “more desirable” sister,
Bianca.

While the play contained many com-
plexities and subplots, the main focus
was thus: Everyone in the town wants to
marry Bianca because she’s pretty and
tame, but her father won’t marry her off
until Kate, a shrew (or “difﬁcult, temper-
amental woman”) is married. The play
follows how one man, Petruchio (also
known as Heath Ledger, in the movie 10

   

 

 



Things I Hate About You) “tames” Kate
into marrying him and obeying him as a
loyal wife as well as the rivalry of mul-
tiple men for the hand ofBianca.

The National Players did a re-hash of
the play, and instead of setting it in Italy
where Shakespeare had imagined it, put
it in the Wild West. Men were adorned
in cowboy boots and wide~brimmed
hats and women in lush lace dresses.
The set was composed of intentionally
ramshackle buildings constructed to cor-
respond to the run-down houses of West-
ern ﬁlm fame. As ifstraight out ofa Clint
Eastwood spaghetti-Western, characters
carried pistols, faced stand-offs and
drank in saloons. The lights would dim
to subtle orange during love scenes, like
a classic Arizona sunset.

The style ofthis play was drawn from
the classical Italian Renaissance theatre

 

   pagrfiaf. the 

      Phi needs ectedacarea  
iwrifers ijfo cover p ,  ,
 ears on camp.t1s.and ,"

 

  -staff a Sunday l A

tradition of commedia dell’arte. This
translates into the “comedy of craft" in
English, which was a form of comedy
that Shakespeare’s earlier plays were
very fond of. While it calls for ﬂatter,
“two-dimensional” characters and plays
more with traditional archetypal roles, it
allows for a greater depth ofcomedy and
expanded improvisation.

In addition, the Players noted that
while the characters themselves may be
flatter than those in a tragic play (Romeo
and Juliet, for example), it did allow for
a greater cohesion of comedy and physi-
cal interaction in the form ofinsults and
slapstick which, in turn, gave greater
leeway into the understanding of the
themes ofthe play itself.

Throughout the show, the atmosphere
was full ofcomedy. Assistant Director of
the National Players Michael Kelly said

 

ofthe play, “The world of The Taming of

the Shrew is one rife with classic comic
situations: servants disguised as their
masters, masters disguised as servants,
young lovers deceiving their fathers, and
joyful triple marriage."

The National Players did everything
in their power to capture this world.
With a combination of slapstick argu-
ments, street brawls, and comedic sound
effects to accompany the ﬁght scenes,
the audience roared in laughter at every
motion performed by the actors. Many
scenes where the characters verbally in-
sulted one another (as is likely to hap-
pen in Shakespeare plays) were also ac-
companied by physical violence. In the
minds of the Players, this juxtaposition
of the physical and the verbal insults
showcased the intense intellectual and
emotional sparring of the characters.

For example, the ﬁghts between Kate
and Petruchio elicited laughter as they
literally personified the classic “battle of
the sexes.”

i On the surface level, the humor was
light and witty in a way only Shake-
speare could supply. In addition, the in-
telligent and comedic delivery ofthe ex-
perienced actors brought in a great deal
of response from the audience.

The National Players did a fantastic
revamp of the classic Shakespeare play
by adding their own time period, their
own effects, and their own interpreta-
tion of the words. It created an interest-
ing and entertaining production for all
those in the theater. Congratulations to
the National Players for an excellent per-
formancel

Men’s streak ends

Generals lose to 3rd ranked Lynchburg in ODAC championship game

By Leigh Dannhauser
SPORTS EDITOR

Men’s lacrosse jumped to an
early lead against Lynchburg on
Sunday. After the ﬁrst quarter
they held a 2-0 lead in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
championship game thanks to
goals by junior Mac Means and
ﬁrst-year Garret Paglia.

Lynchburg was able to come
back in the second quarter and
entering the second half led the
game 3-2.

The Hornets opened the game
up in the second half. They out-
scored the Generals 8-2 in the
second half.

Lynchburg greatly outshot
Washington and Lee throughout
the entire game. They attempted
41 shots compared to W&L’s 23.

W&L was kept in the game
once again by the goalkeeping
of ﬁrst-year Warren Barenis. He
saved 15 out of the 25 shots that
he faced while playing the full
game in the net. In the ﬁrst two
games of the ODAC tournament
he combined for 25 saves as

W&L defeated the third and sec-
ond_ seeded teams. 7

The Homets proved to be too
much for Barenis and the Gener-
als, forcing their season to end
with a 10-9 record. The Hornets’
season will continue when the
NCAA tournament begins thanks
to an automatic bid from winning
the ODAC title. The NCAA tour-
nament begins on Wednesday.

The Generals won two of three

major awards with the conclusion .
of the game. Junior Joe LaSala »-

won the ODAC Scholar-Athlete
of the Year while ﬁrst-year Cam-
eron Dabir was named Rookie of
the Year. LaSala was also selected
as a member of the ﬁrst-‘team all-
ODAC squad.

The Morse Code

Senior Equestrienne Does Not Horse Around

By Graham Colton
STA F F WR lTE R

“No hour of life is wasted that is spent in
the saddle,” Winston Churchill once said. Un-
doubtedly, Washington and Lee senior horse-
back rider Tamara Morse has spent many an
hour in the saddle. At her Bristow, Va. home,
she trains six days a week with several horses

' including her private horse of two and a half
years, Heads Up 3E. During the spring, sum-
mer, and early fall, Morse rides Heads Up 3E
in New York and Virginia. When the winter
months arrive, the two head south to compete
in Florida. At school, Morse and the W&L
Riding team start practicing in September and
ﬁnish competing in April. After graduation
and outside of work, Morse plans to show
jump with Heads Up 3E.

In addition to her athletic success, this ac-
counting and business administration double
major earned a 4.0 GPA last term. But how
does Morse have the time to do it all? “I’ve
had to become really good at managing my
time to balance my academics and athletics,”
says Morse, who has been showing compet-
itively since the age of six. “Since both of
these take so much time, I had to really com-
mit to do well in both. I have pretty high ex-
pectations for myself and I’ve really pushed
myself to meet these expectations in both rid-
ing and school.”

Morse, who has thrice been awarded Old
Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC)/F arm

Bureau Insurance Scholar-Athlete of the Year
honors, recently took home red and white rib-
bons in the 2012 Intercollegiate Horse Show
Association (IHSA) National Championships
at the Hunt Horse Complex in Raleigh, N.C.
Last Thursday, Morse placed second out of 10
competitors in the Individual Open Equitation
on the Flat to become the Reserve National
Champion. On Friday, she defeated 32 oth-
er equestriennes to claim fourth place in the
United States Equestrian Foundation (USEF)/
Cacchione Cup for the second straight year.
Despite sitting in 13th place with 77.00 points
after the ﬁrst fences phase of the event, she
tied for third place in the flat Phase II with
84.50 points to ﬁnish fourth overall with
161.50 total points. ‘

Both recently and throughout her career,
Morse has succeeded by diligently practicing
during the academic year and outside it. “‘I’ve
worked really hard to get where I’m at,” she
says. “At home I ride six days a week, often
riding several horses each day. At school I
can’t ride as much so I have to make the most
of the practices I do have.”

Since mounting a horse at her aunt’s house
as a four-year-old toddler, Morse has “always
loved animals.” She has worked the past four
summers as a Veterinary Assistant at Occo-
quan Animal Hospital in Woodbridge, Va. In
this labor of love, she takes “care of boarders

and _patients including medicating, feeding,
cleaning up after [animals], and general care
[of animals].”

Her job description also includes “assist-
ing veterinarians with treatments and exami-
nations.” At home and at school, though, par-
ents, coaches, and teammates have helped her.
Morse gratefully acknowledges their impor-
tance to her success. “My parents have given
a lot for me to ride,” Morse says. “My train-
ers have been fantastic in helping me pursue
my goals so I can do well at this level.” Since
joining Coach Gordon Reistrup and the varsi-

ty riding squad in the fall of2008, Morse has ‘

thoroughly enjoyed being a part ofthe team.

Unlike most of her teammates, however,
Morse competes individually in regionals,
zones, and nationals until early May. Given
the victorious conclusion to her senior season,
though, Morse now looks to life beyond col-
lege and riding. Following graduation, she
begins a summer internship with accounting
giant Ernst and Young in McLean, Va. “After
that I have a fewadditional credits to com-
plete online for the CPA exam and I have to
take the CPA exam,” Morse says. “Hopefully
I will start work full—time with EY the follow-
ing fall.” If she can audit as well as her and
Heads Up 3E can clear a showjump, she will
probably get thejob.

SPORTS EDITOR

The women’s lacrosse team took an early
lead on Sunday and never looked back.

Washington and Lee struck ﬁrst, taking a
3-0 lead within the ﬁrst seven minutes of the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference champi-
onship game against Roanoke. It was a lead
they would never relinquish as they became
ODAC champs 53 minutes ofplay later.
i The biggest difference in the game was
shot differential. The Generals took 42 shots,
more than two and a half times the sixteen
shots that the Maroons took. Maroon goalies
Lauren Curtin and Laura Zdziarski combined
for 13 saves.

Leading the Generals on the scoreboard
were sophomores Margaret Klein and Meéde

Brewster, and senior Alli Shearin. Klein
scored a game-high ﬁve goals and added an
assist. Brewster and Shearin added four goals
apiece to the Generals total while Shearin
added three assists as well. All three were
named ﬁrst team all-ODAC after the comple-
tion of the game.

Senior goalie Cara Mulligan was added to
the ﬁrst-team all-ODAC squad as well. On
Sunday she made seven saves and allowed
three goals in over 50 minutes of play. On the
season she made 94 saves in 19 games and
had an 84.6 win percentage.

The biggest lead for the Generals in the
ﬁrst half was ﬁve goals. They led 6-1 with
thirteen minutes left in the half and led 8-3

entering halftime.

W&L opened the game up during the sec-
ond half of play. They went on a 9-0 run that
lasted nearly the ﬁrst 25 minutes of the half.
Roanoke scored their ﬁrst goal of the second
half with just 5:30 remaining in the game to
make it l7-4.

Jamie Golden and Kathleen Wager led the
way for Roanoke. Golden scored three of the
goals while Wager scored the other two.

Roanoke ends their season with an I1-7
record.

With the win W&L improves to a l5-4 re-
cord. They also receive an automatic bid to
the NCAA tournament. The opening round of
the tournament begins Wednesday.

_ Big Changes for The Phi

Plans for restructuring over the summer and a new system of writing means the ‘I2- ’I 3 Phi will be better than ever

By Julianna Satterly
MANAGING EDITOR

Another year of The Ring-
tum Phi is coming to a close,
and while it has been a good one
we are always trying to make
the paper better. With that in
mind, look forward to a whole
ﬂ new paper fall term! Over the
summer my editorial staff and
I are going to restructure the
paper, maybe include some cos-
metic changes and biggest of
all, we are changing the way we
do reporting.

For those of you in the know,
we’re transitioning to a beat
reporting system. If you’re not
a J-Major, like me, I’ll take a
second to explain the idea. Basi-
cally, currently we have writers
who pick a topic and write an
article about it. At the beginning
of the week our editors come
up with several story ideas, and
writers can pick-and-choose
which they want to pursue. Say

   
   
   
  
 
   
   
   
 

“sayonara” to that system. Af-.

ism School’s Alumni Advisory
Board, we have decided that it
would be much more effective
to run a beat system. In a beat
system, a certain topic (called a
beat) is covered by one report-
er (the beat reporter) all year.
So each week at our new staff
meetings, each reporter will tell
their editor what the article’s
topic will be that week.

A speciﬁc beat, for exam-
ple, would be Greek Life. The
reporter covering Greek Life
would write an article every
week about Pan Hellenic or In-
terfratemity Council meetings,
upcoming philanthropy events,
etc. At the staff meetings on
Mondays, instead of the editors
coming up with story ideas, they
will ask each writer what they’ll
be covering in their beat. This
puts a lot more responsibility
on the writer and a lot less work
on the shoulders of the editors

ﬁrst fall-term edition explain-
ing exactly what it is that we
do here). So, for this new sys-
tem we are looking for a team
of writers who are committed
and excited about covering their

the Student Activities Fair next
year, where I’ll be sitting with a
sign-up sheet.

Interested in any of these
beats? Interested in writing re-
views on movies or food ‘in Lex-
ington? Email me at phi@wlu.
edu or satterlyjl4@mail.wlu.

It doesn’t matter what you
plan on majoring in. As long
as you are willing to get your
hands dirty and report the truth
to the student body, then you
can cover a beat for The Ring-
tum Phi.

Get excited because the new-
and-improved paper is coming

V Renovations are planned for the Gra-
ham-Lees and Gaines residential halls
starting in the summer of'20l3 to help
improve residential life for ﬁrst-year stu-
dents.

Both Graham-Lees and Gaines were
identiﬁed in the plan because they both
have faults in their design. According to
. the article, “W&L to Upgrade First-Year

 

(look forward to an article in the

First-year housing upgrades in 2013‘

Both Graham-Lees and Gaines residence halls are under review for renovations in 2013 to improve ﬁrst-year life

The maze-like ﬂoor plan of Graham-Lees (left) and the .
isolated suites and tunnel-like halls in Gaines (right) are high on
the agenda for the plan to improve ﬁrst-year residential life.

view,” by Jeff Hanna, executive director
of communications and public affairs,
the “maze-like interior” of Graham-Lees
due to the joining of Graham and Lees
hall in 1940 and the isolation of Gaines
due to its suite style construction are fac-
tors in the decision to renovate.

Sidney Evans, Vice President of
Student Affairs and Dean of Students,
was quoted saying that within Gaines,

   

“there’s no reason for students to come
out of their rooms into the hall, which
reduces the possibilities for community
that are particularly important for ﬁrst-
year students.”

John Hoogakker, the executive direc-
tor of University facilities, said: “The
need for renovation in Graham-Lees
was obvious during my ﬁrst visit to that
building last summer. I became aware of
the shortcomings in the Gaines conﬁgu-
ration through meetings with our Student
Affairs professionals during the fall.”

According to Hanna’s article, the
renovations target a variety of factors,
including “providing more outlets for
students to socialize,” improving the ex-
terior and surroundings of the buildings,
and creating new facilities to “engage
students with programs, lectures, and
even classes.”

Hoogakker said that the plan includes
“general renovation/upgrade in Graham-
Lees and a new ﬂoor plan (with a more
Graham-Lees-like room layout) plus
upgrades for Gaines.” He also said that
more features, including lounges, laun-
dry, and more, are planned for both resi-
dence halls.

The project cost represents about 4%
of the Strategic Plan. Steve McAllister,
the University’s Treasurer and Vice Pres-
ideht for Finance, said: “The First Year
Housing project is currently estimated
to be in the $25 million to $26 million
range. It is hoped that over the coming
months as design is finalized and logis-
tics of the project settled, that we may be
able to reduce this budget.”

McAllister added that the renovations
will be funded “primarily through addi-
tional debt that the University will take
on during the next academic year.”

In Hanna’s article, Evans states that

one of the main questions for the task 4

force is, “whether there is a way to pro-
vide more opportunities for men and
women to interact outside of the class-
room and outside of a party.”

Evans also said: “Students interact
in a very unstructured and informal sort
of way throughout their ﬁrst year, in the
residence halls and the dining hall. And

that changes dramatically at the begin-

According to Hanna’s article, the task
force, as purposed by the Strategic Plan,
“also is analyzing the current living pat-
terns of sophomores, juniors and seniors
and assessing on—campus housing for
upper-class students.”

Inquire to phi@wIu.edu or satterIyj14@maiI. wIu.edu

In reference to the goals of the First- ‘

Year Housing Project, Hoogakker said,
“My team will be delighted if we can
meet/surpass the expectations of our
customers (the studentsl), colleagues in
Student Affairs and the goals of the Task
Force.” '

Getting the most out of your four years of college

Senior Patrick Smith describes his love for W&L and oﬂers advice for undergraduates in his last article

As I sit and
ponder a Ring-
tum Phi opin-
ion article idea,
I look back to
last week’s is-

sue. Stockton
Bullitt pro-
vides great

input to those
interested (or
bad) at writing
articles for the

 

, school news-
CDLUIINIST papa-_
His com-

ments about Georgia Robertson’s fa-
mously stupid fraternity article were
spot on. There was no point to the ar-
ticle other than to highlight the nega-
tive aspects of fraternity life. The jokes
were not ﬁinny, and there was a negative

amount of creativity. If I were to write
an article being brutally honest about
each sorority at our school, I would be
thrown out. This is the world we live in,
guys, so I digress.

However, for writing that nonsense,
Ms. Robertson, I will gather a group of
people later today, and we will collec-
tively “boo” you. I hope you can hear us
from the country.

The most important takeaway from
Mr. Bullitt’s article was his ﬁrst point.
When you write an opinion article, actu-
ally have an opinion. I will be the ﬁrst
to admit that I have been guilty of this
in the past. I have written some abso-
lutely heinous garbage for this paper,
and for that I say to you all, “Sorry I’m
not sorry.”

For my last article ever, I thought I
would put in a bit more effort. But not
too much more effort because I am on

Spring Option and don’t have class.
Ever. ‘

The opinion I have for this article is
simple: Washington and Lee is a great
place. I am being 100% honest, and
fully stand behind that statement. This
place has treated me well over the years.

Washington and Lee have prepared me
for what lies ahead.

The main thing I learn as I enjoy my
Spring Option is that nothing should be
taken for granted. Treat every experi-
ence you have at this school like it’s
your last. It will all end at some point

The opinion I have for this article is simple.‘ Wash-

ington and Lee is a great place.

The fact that I was able to learn at such .

a great institution, play baseball for four
years, and be in a great-ﬁt fratemity is
nothing shy of a blessing (or a miracle?).
For this, I am very grateful.

Like any other person at this school,
I have had many highs and lows. The
memories and experiences I have had at

As my
freshman year
draws to a close
and I look back
on the past
L few months, I
feel as though
one of my re-
sponsibilities
(other than

minding myself
that my major
is English and
not “profes-
sional slacking

off’) is to pay,

homage to the little nest that holds our
campus: Lexington. Let’s face it—when
you decided to come to W&L, your ﬁrst
though wasn’t “...and then I’ll gradu-
ate and become a permanent member of

Rockbridge County!” Professors, for-
give me, but as a bright-eyed and bushy-
tailed young college student, Lexington
doesn’t exactly scream ideal post-gradu-

curb outside good ole Wally World and
nearly dropped their bags at the sight
of the rolling mountains, their emer-
ald peaks cascading across the skyline?

and you never want to look back and
think, “I could have done just a little bit
more here.” .

I have seen idiots get an A on a test
because they worked hard. I have seen
whimps shotgun a beer because it’s fun.
I have seen jerks get beat up because
they deserved it. I cannot help but feel

running into someone I knew. The rea-
son I include Sweet Frog is to mention
the irony of it—the fact that W&L kids

my days here, I feel I must tribute my top
three subtle, perhaps more underappreci-

make up the gem that is “Lex Vegas.”

Whoa. Honestly, have you ever had a
moment like that in another parking lot‘?
Every time I go to Walmart and trek the
parking lot, I have a genuine moment of
thanks that I can live in a place where
even the local Walmart, maybe one of
the most commercial places imaginable,
can render me speechless.

Again, deﬁnitely NOT underappre-

gas station and eat frozen
yogurt is almost poetic
juxtaposition. Personally,
I ﬁnd the place charming
and weirdly comforting;
it is full simple pleasures
such as the brick wall wall-paper I noted
peeling off of the side of Subway. I was
also particularly tickled by the addition
of their newest ﬂavor “Maple Bacon Do-
nut” (the handmade label with surpris-
ingly artistic bubble letters).

Studio Eleven

I bet I’ve got you with this one. Only
those of us who have taken poetry class-
es (pardon me if you somehow just ﬁnd
out about these things) have ever been to
Studio Eleven, I made my ﬁrst appear-

the nostalgia coursing from the plantars
of my feet up through the auburn hairs
atop my head.

Congratulations to all the seniors
graduating on the 24th. It has been a
long road and we are nearing the end
of it. Remember all of the good times,
but most importantly, pay Leonardo Di-
Caprio to “incept” you into forgetting all

the bad memories. If that’s not how “In- ‘

ception” works, careface. That is such a
stupid movie.

Goodbye, Ring-tum Phi. I hope that
a nonsense-spewing—opinions-article-
writing-person springs up. Additionally,
I hope Georgia Robertson never graces
your print again. '

I leave you with one ﬁnal joke:
Crowded elevators smell different to
midgets.

ance last night for a poetry reading, to
earn extra credit for class. At the read-
ing, professors and townsfolk came to-
gether to share poems they had written.
The setting couldn’t have been more per-
fect: soft lighting caressed every corner
of this quaint, white-walled room. The
walls aren’t bare, though—-my favor-
ite part about Studio Eleven is the art-
work. Paintings of natural scenery such
as mountains or grassy ﬁelds deck the
walls in a way that isn’t overwhelming,
but rather contributes to the overall re-
laxing atmosphere in the room.

So, that’s my tribute, and I hope that
in my ﬁnal years here, I can continue to
discover and appreciate the quirks of our
town the way I do the Stars Hollow of
Gilmore Girls. Because while it “doesn’t
have a seedy underbelly. . .it doesn’t even
have a parking meter,” it is still near and
dear to my heart.

At W&L we tend
to think of ourselves
as living in a bubble.
College life, especial-
ly in Lex, just seems
divorced from the
real world. While this
_ 7 may be true, there are
\ surprising exceptions.
I Our skills can actu-
' ally take us far in the
internship world, if
employed well.

To use them, we
actually have to have
the job. This can be
a bit of an issue, with the economy and the
competitiveness of good internships. Alumni
can help with this but what is really golden is
when someone from your frat or srat has the

more about surviving a cocktail party than a
W&L student? As it turns out socializing over
alcohol is a large part of how people get jobs
and keep them. Want that promotion? Better
go with the boss to the bar. I intern at the
House Budget Committee and we keep a few
bottles of good wine on hand, you know, just
in case. (Maybe if we broke them out more
often the Democrats would like The Path to
Prosperity a little more?)

People say networking is the key way peo-

show that you would be ftm to hang out with
on a regular basis. An office is a lot like a so-
rority, just more men, more pantsuits, and a
(little) less drama.

We have the skills, now we just have to
adapt them to the workplace. So get ready, do
your research, and have the dankest summer
of your life. (Stockton Bullitt said we were
supposed to use that word so I had to put it in
somewhere. You’re welcome.)

All the things Ididn’t get to say

Surprise! Stockton Bullitt is back with a ﬁnal article. reﬂects on his four years and oﬂers advice for younger students

Graduation
season is upon
us, which means
there will be a
ton of stuff di-
rected towards
the future for the
Class of 2012
(aka the Mayan
‘ grade). Now,
" it is the time to
hear what our
class can and
will hopefully
become. If you
are unfamil-
iar with this type of rhetoric, just You-
Tube “Steve Jobs Stanford” or “Conan
O’Brien Dartmouth” and you’ll get your
ﬁll of these kinds of speeches.

Thanks to the Internet and previous
Washington and Lee graduations, I’m
pretty comfortable with these kinds of
speeches: a) make a couple of school
speciﬁc jokes, b) talk about personal life
in struggle form and c) bring it back to

   

Byistc-clctori1Bull'
CDLUIINIST

. graduating senior applicable cliches and

analogies. I’m not nearly as good as suc-
cessful people at this kind of rhetoric.
Also, as a graduating senior myself, I
don’t know what the heck is behind the
curtain. So I’m not going to say anything
to the Class of 2012, other than wasn’t it
absurd that I didn’t beat the RA in that
trivia game during O-Week? There was
money to be won and they gave it to a
guy who wasn’t even a freshman. Re-
ally?

Anyway, since the “You can do it
graduating seniors” rhetoric has been
done so much before, there is obvious-
ly going to be counter rhetoric because
writers always need something original
to talk about. Recently, I read Bret Ste-
phens’ opinion article “To the Class of
2012” in the Wall Street Journal. Be-
fore you think that I’m trying to show
oﬂ° that I read the Wall Street Journal, I
actually saw it on my Facebook feed. In
the article, Bret Stephens laments on the
problems of the graduating generation.
He shares with us facts about life that we
obviously don’t understand like “in our
‘knowledge-based’ economy, knowl-
edge counts. Yet here you are, probably
the least knowledgeable graduating class
in history.” This is typical of a 38 year
old Middlesex graduate, who just broke
his “the kids today aren’t like they used
to be” cherry.

For some reason, this article has
bugged me the last few days. And while
I don’t appreciate the condescension,
I thought I would imitate the patron-
izing “I know more than you now that
I’m older and therefore smarter” Harry
Wormwood (the dad in “Matilda”) style
tone for an opinion article. So, for my
last article, I am going to try to give you
readers some advice about how to spend
the rest of your careers at Washington
and Lee. These are things that I either
was lucky enough to do, or really wish I
had done in my four years in Lexington.
And, hopefully, they will be a bit more
nuanced then the back of the t-shirt you
were given during your pre-O trip.

Don’t Worry So Much about
Who You Are _

A common criticism (sometimes a

compliment) of W&L is that the social

scene can be a lot like high school. Juicy I

Campus,.College ACB and poorly writ-
ten opinion articles (sorry, but I can’t
get enough of Georgia Robertson) have

created a socially—aware atmosphere
that can sometimes make students feel
embarrassed about their identities. This
criticism can come from both ends: “Oh
you’re studying on a Friday?” and “Oh,

generation. Of the little professional ad-
vice I have been given, most of it tends
to be, “No really, you’re not that smart.”
Now, it could be that I think I’m right a
little too much. Stop nodding your head.

No, the reason liberal arts colleges are necessary

and the reason I went to one is because liberal arts

colleges serve one purpose: they help you ﬁnd the

one thing you really love.

you’re going out on a Monday?” usually
have the same effect when ac company-
ing raised eyebrows.

Furthermore, you get people like Mr.
Stephens calling your brains “like old
maps, with lots of blank spaces for the
uncharted terrain.” The common lament
on our generation is that we have no real
knowledge, are much more spoiled than
any other generation in history, and we
are so addicted to technology that we
have no real basis for communication.
If you listened to enough people both
in school and online (print’s not really
a medium anymore), you would most
likely believe that whatever you are do-
ing and feeling is probably misguided
and ignorant.

Do not listen to anything those peo-
ple are saying. You are in college. You
get four years to have your own preroga-

tive. High school is about leaming so- -

cial norms, tricking parents, and getting
into college. It’s not until you are out of
college you start having those dreaded
responsibilities. Therefore, the times be-
fore and after college necessitate some
type of conformity, but college is your
time to be selﬁsh. Since it’s only four
years, you can’t waste this free time
worrying about who you are. If I could
change one thing about my four-year
experience, it would deﬁnitely be spend-
ing less time doubting my own personal
validity and letting friends question

' theirs. You don’t have enough time here

to think that you are worthless; just re-
member, you got into W&L and there is
someone somewhere who already thinks
you’re great, so why spend time ques-
tioning that person’s beliefs?

Don’t Be Cocky

Now the other side of that coin
is to not to take your own personal va-
lidity to be superior to anyone else’s. I
know that I’m starting to sound like a
kindergarten teacher, but frankly, I think
most problems at this school stem from
someone being a little too sure of them-
selves. You shouldn’t feel bad for go-

ing out on a Monday or staying in on a ,

Friday, but you certainly are not a better
person for making that decision. ‘

It’s pretty simple, if you remain over-
ly conﬁdent in yourself, three things can
happen. One, other people start to detest
you. Chicks don’t dig the “two truths
and a lie” pick-up line. The “I’m god’s
gift to mankind” freshman always gets
shafted on bid night. Professors tend to
dislike “I’m going to comment on every-
thing that is said in class” student. The
“I’m better than you” upperclassman al-
ways gets kidnapped. The social scene
tends to give overly cocky people their
comeuppance.

Two, you will leave W&L with the
exact overly-inﬂated sense of self-worth
that older generations say plagues our

But it could also be that older people are
tired of being told how life really is by
younger people who do not know what
they are really saying. Go on a quick
tangent, if you can. Give more time
than you already devote to ﬁnding a job.
Whatever job that is, don’t obsess over
it, but try and give it more attention.
Three, nothing will happen. There are
a bunch of overly-cocky people (both
student and staff) at this school who nev-
er get what they really deserve. Most of
these people will continue to live in the
dark and continue to believe they have a
direct line to the divine. If you made it
this far in the article, odds are you aren’t
this person. Try and avoid him or her.

Cross the Picket Line

At W&L, there is a’ social
pyramid that has a distinct top and bot-
tom. Who is located where on this so-
cial pyramid is anyone’s guess. Most of
the student community at W&L either
abides by the rules governing the chutes
and ladders dictating the ﬂuidity of this
pyramid or abhors and ignores the exis-
tence of said pyramid and tries to stay as
far away from “that scene.”

Whether you are ﬁrmly entrenched
in one of these two groups or you ﬁnd
yourself vacillating between the two
warring factions, this is an element of
W&L culture. My advice is not to re-
spect or ignore the existence of this so-
cial pyramid, but to get to know people
on both sides. You will be so much bet-
ter for knowing someone at W&L who ‘is
not like you that you will probably not
notice the change. On both a micro and
a macro level, it is absolutely vital that
you graduate W&L knowing that people
are basically the same, nice people wher-
ever you go.

If you are some loser guy who likes
hoodies a little too much, don’t be afraid
to talk to the pretty girl who wears de-
signer clothing. As long as there is no
pretense of creepy ﬂirtation, the girl is

not going to shun you. Although it’s"

W&L, it’s not actually high school. The
social apex cliques at W&L for the most
part are ﬁlled with genuinely nice people
who are down to earth, only they are
burdened with the fact that most people
like them. Likewise, if you are a frat or
srat star, make sure you befriend an in-
dependent who could not care less about
the Greek system at W&L. Almost ev-
ery single personl have met outside the
Greek system is both incredibly kind and
fascinating. You don’t really know until
you do this, but you learn a lot about
who you are by chilling with someone
who is not like you, and that’s a good
thing.

You can apply this to warring W&L
factions ﬁghting over anything. If you
are a Democrat (and you’re probably
not), listen to what the Republicans

have to say, and vice versa. Well, except
on the gay marriage debate. You don’t
want to be like the 82% of Americans
who disapproved of interracial marriage
when it was deemed constitutional in
1967. Sorry, I couldn’t resist.

Lastly, if you are not on ﬁrst name
terms with at least one or two intema-
tional students, then why are your par-
ents paying so much money for you to
go here? The same goes for you, intema-
tional students.

Do One Dumb Thing (that
doesn’t get you kicked out)

Yeah, most of you have already beat-

en me to the punch here, but for the se-
lect few of you who haven’t or believe
you haven’t done one really dumb thing
while here, you need to listen. Every-
one else can simply indulge me. Let’s
be honest, there is not one thing short
of cheating, lying, stealing and drunk
driving that will get you kicked out of
this institution. Well, any kind of sexual
misconduct will get you kicked out, but

if you are the type of person to commit -

that misconduct, you really shouldn’t be
here in the ﬁrst place. Now that we have
the bases covered, W&L is one of the
few places in life that you get a couple
of second chances (three to be exact).
Hopefully, the reasoning behind this is
because the school recognizes that you
learn best when you screw up. If you are
one of the minority who has yet to learn
this lesson, it’s a vital one. College is the
best place to ﬁnd out what doesn’t work,
and every single success story that I have
read contains one experiment blowing
up catastrophically. There’s numerous
clichés to put to end this part with, but
I’ll just settle for “you don’t know how
to do something right until you screw it
up a couple times.” Make sure you do
that, and make especially sure you get
caught. You won’t regret it.

Befriend Lex‘Po and the Deans

Keep your friends close; keep
your “authorities who choose to pick off
mostly innocent low hanging fruit and
ignore the more dangerous larger social
issues on campus” closer.

Befriend W&L’s Staff (and
maybe a faculty member or two)
During sophomore year, I started
visiting friends at different schools. I
got to see the variance in how schools
are actually run. I began to realize that
D-Hall isn’t as low on the totem pole as
I am led to believe, but I also saw how
the students and staff interacted with one
another.

As a northerner, I sometimes ﬁnd the
whole southern hospitality thing to be a
bit overrated. People in the South aren’t
necessarily more chipper and polite than
their northern counterparts. However,
there is a strong element of southern
hospitality on campus. W&L is unparal-
leled in the courtesy and warmth emit-
ted by the people who take the effort to
make this school better. I found most of
my mid-week early morning hangovers
cured by the wonderﬁrl Co-op ladies,
and although I will never forgive carn-
pus security for not letting me park in

the admissions parking spots when I re- ,

ally needed to go to the library, they are
always looking to help students get out
of bad situations rather than putting stu-
dents in worse situations. Trust me, these

are rare for college campuses. Therefore, A

I ﬁnd it imperative that we as students

develop strong relationships with these
great people. Yes, these people get paid,
but anyone can simply go to a job and
get paid; people with strong moral ﬁber
go to their job and make life better for
the world around them.

Oh, and use oﬂice hours, especially
with the good professors. You can’t re-
ally do that enough.

Find the Thing You Love

Considering there are so many
liberal arts in the country, there must be
a point to going to one. Mr. Stephens la-
mented that our generation only knows
how to think without knowing anything
speciﬁc whatsoever, so the whole “learn-
ing how to learn” argument doesn’t real-
ly check out. Nor does going the liberal
arts route help you ﬁnd a meaningful
career, as any graduating senior with a
B.A. in B.S. will tell you.

No, the reason liberal arts colleges
are necessary and the reason I went
to one is because liberal arts colleges
serve one purpose: they help you ﬁnd
the one thing you really love. If you al-
ready know what you love, then there
are many other universities you can go
to that provide the vehicles for working
on the thing you love. But the nice part
about liberal arts schools is that it gives
you so many options, you are bound to
ﬁnd something you truly love.

That love does not need to be purely
academic. You can fall in love with in-
vesting or consulting. You can fall in
love with your sport or even Frisbee golf.
It can even be the friends you’ve made in
your fraternity or sorority. Whatever that
thing is, you only really know it when
you have it.

It’s that thing you don’t mind wak-

'ing up early for. You’re not a big fan of

the shitty times your passion can give
you, but instead of discouraging you,
it somehow makes you work harder.
It’s the kind of thing you don’t realize
how much you truly love doing it until
about midway through doing it. It seeps
its way into dreams, both during the day
and night. During the good times, you
sometimes have to stop yourself and
ask, “How the t"‘** am I so lucky to be
here right now?” It’s the kind of thing
that brings you from a resting point of
ﬁve out of ten to seven out of ten just by
being present in your life. When there’s
work to be done, you usually put it lower
down on the list, just so you can work
towards doing it. It’s a nice escape from
the worst parts of the day, and it never
fails to make a better day even better.
Best of all, that passion continuously re-
wards you for your love, paying inﬁnite
dividends on a regular basis.

You won’t necessarily ﬁnd this pas-
sion at W&L, and I’m sorry if you don’t
because that’s why you’re going here.
It’s why W&L gets such a sweet endow-
ment, because its alumni (and its alumni
ofﬁce unfortunately for us graduating
seniors) know that the love and passion
that gave them the guidance and direc-
tion to become successful later in life
originated in Lexington and not in their
respective hometowns.

It took me a while, but I was lucky
enough to ﬁnd that one thing I love while
at W&L.

Her name’s Caitie.

Thank you for a great four years,
W&L. I wish you the best.

uates, and how the school has changed

deﬁnitely exist at this point).

by tandems (steered by a sober student)
and the bus, a horse-drawn carriage. Ev-
ery student will be limited to one three-
minute, ice cold? shower every day.

Despite these efforts, students will continue to drive

A huge gas—guzzling vehicles, throw beer cans into the

woods and have massive bond ﬁres.
 

Sustainable: And you think the

library is freezing now? Oh, just
you wait. By my 50th reunion, efforts
to help the environment will be taken
to new extremes. The Sustainability Ini-
tiative of 2064 will mean replacing the
three layers students currently wear in
the library with a full ski suit, mask, and
handwarrners during the winter months.
The library will even be renamed “Ley-
freeze.” Classes will be taught with the
lights off and students will study by can-
dlelight. Traveller cars will be replaced

Despite these efforts, students will
continue to drive huge gas-guzzling ve-
hicles, throw beer cans into the woods
and have massive bon ﬁres which will,
of course, cancel out all possible effects
ofthe school’s initiatives.

Mixed: “Gender relations” is one

of the most discussed issues on
campus. Much of this discussion stems
around the fact that boys and girls go
from living and eating together freshman
year to moving to different sides of catn-
pus and eating in separate dining halls

sophomore year.

In 2064, efforts to bring the sexes to-
gether will be so extreme that boys and
girls will be given the chance to live to-
gether in a double their freshmen year.
Bathrooms will be coed and large coin-
munal showers will be built so students
can spend more sober time together.

A couple of brave individuals will at-
tempt to start coed Greek organizations.
The school’s endowment will drop 20%
as a result.

Equal: By the time my 50th

rolls around, everything about
the W&L experience will be equal for
females and males. While these plans
may require collaboration with national
Greek organizations, they will involve
dropping speciﬁed male visitation hours
for the sorority houses, hosting parties
on sorority row, and moving double beds
into sorority houses. Girls will take to
smashing beer bottles down the hall on
weekend nights and punching holes in
the walls when angry.

Additionally, at this point, the school

e like when she returns

will ‘nave done away with the double

, standard, which brings me to my next

point.

Promiscuous: Let‘s be honest,

our parent; would have been hor-
riﬁed ifthey knew the “hook up culture”
would dominate college life within 30-
35 years: I d<in‘t even want to know
what the kids will be doing in 50 years
(especially with the extinction of the
double standard...)

The school will realize that posters
suggesting date ideas are not enough to
change the culture. and. the school will
provide any boy who takes 21 girl on a
date a case of beer for his efforts. After-
all. how else do you motivate a male col-
legc student to do something‘? .

More diverse: I don‘t know how

much this says, considering it
would be nearly impossible to attract a
more homogcnous group than the stu-
dents who currently attend. But. if all of
my other predictions tail, I can rest as-
sured that l was right about something.

President
Obama’s State-
ment on Gay

  
   

2012:

“At a certain
‘point I’ve just
'1 concluded‘ that
for me, person-
ally, it is impor-
tant for me to
go ahead and

_ _ afﬁrm that I
By‘t"ates ‘M burn think same-sex
CDLUMNIST ' couples ’ should

Yates’ Translation from Politispeak to
English:

“After being held at gunpoint by Joe
Biden’s big mouth, I’ve concluded that
I can’t continue to have an ‘evolving’
opinion on gay marriage without looking
like an idiot. So, I ‘think’ that same-sex
couples ‘should’ have the right to get
married.

But, so I don’t anger my black sup-
porters, l’ll leave any legislative action
up to the states, criticize Republicans for
having this same opinion for the past 30
years, and hope everyone forgets this by
November.”

A Note to the President:

I’m no fan of yours Mr. President, but
you probably should’ve dealt with this
issue earlier. You really expect people-
particularly your more liberal base—to
believe that your “evolving” position on
gay marriage just happened to mature
RIGHT after Joe Biden created a ﬁre-
storm of bad press for your administra-
tion by actually speaking his mind on the
issue?

Now—contrary to your claim
that it would be “hard to argue that this is
something [you’d] be doing this for the
political advantage,”—you are forced to
make a wishy-washy statement on an is-

Marriage, May

sue you’d rather avoid, so as to offend as
few of your liberal and black voters as
possible.

In hindsight, you should have made

marriage liberal voters—but don’t get
upset when people question your authen-
ticity in suddenly ﬁnding your heart in
a mediocre, mushy position that avoids

Pick a side and either reap the beneﬁts or suﬂer the

consequences at the ballot box.

 

a statement early in your presidency re-
garding your opinion on gay marriage, to
avoid such damaging publicity so close
to the election. Instead, you dragged it
out and made it into a campaign issue
that you are poorly equipped to handle;
as your middle of the road opinion has
only made two of your core demograph-

~ics (blacks and strong liberals) question

their support. In addition, you have giv-
en Mitt Romney a tool he can use to get
closer to Republican evangelicals, some-
thing he was having a huge problem do-
ing (thanks for that by the way).

People’s opinions “evolve” as chil-

dren and young adults. My own opin-
ion on this issue could be ﬁled under
“evolving.” But, if I don’t have at least a
tendency towards a position on gay mar-
riage in the next 5 years, something’s up.
By the time someone is your age, a per-
son at least has a gut reaction to an issue
or at the very least a bias. Now, it is not
uncommon or unreasonable for some-
one to change an established opinion on
something given new information, but to
still be formulating one? Please.

This all boils down to an unwilling-
ness to take responsibility for holding
a real opinion on a controversial issue.
Pick a side and either reap the beneﬁts or
suffer the consequences at the ballot box.
I understand the diﬁicult position you’re
in—tom between largely anti-gay mar-
riage black voters and largely pro-gay

any real commitment to anything.

' Prominent ﬁgures on both the right
and wrong sides of other dividing is-
sues in history and today didn’t cop out
like this. Say what you want about them,
but people like Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Strom Thurmond, George Wallace, Su-
san- B. Anthony, George Washington,
Robert E. Lee, Abraham Lincoln, lef-
ferson Davis, Winston Churchill, Angela
Merkel, and even Lady freakin’ Gaga all
did what they thought was right (mostly
against popular opinion), proudly took
the ﬂak, and accepted the results either
way. George Wallace even had the honor
to admit his ignorance and wrongdoing
in the late l970’s after the success ofthe
Civil Rights movement.

Having said that, I am not trying to
put the issue of gay marriage on par with
the Civil Rights movement ofthe l960’s.
Many liberal pundits in the media and
politics have attempted to do so, saying
that anti-gay‘marriage advocates are in
actuality anti-gay rights, and that they
are in the same league as the KKK and
the Nazis. Last time I checked, no, poli-
tician of signiﬁcance from either party
was campaigning against gay rights to
vote, hold a job without discrimination,
speak freely, own a ﬁrearm, or be tried
fairly-—£ertainly not to. the extent blacks
were during Jim Crow. My opinion on
the comparison of this issue and the Civil
Rights movement was summarized per-

fectly by Republican National Commit- ,
tee Chairman Reince Priebus in saying
“I think there’s a big difference between
people that have been murdered and ev-
erything else that comes with Jim Crow‘,
than marriage between [two men] and
[two women].”

The question of basic rights for gay
Americans has been largely settled in
my opinion. No functioning member
of American society of any authority is
making the claim that gays are not peo-
ple, or are somehow lesser htiman beings
to the extent that such was historically
claimed about women and blacks (cer-
tainly not as openly or without conse-
quence). Such comparisons distract from
the real issue, and serve as an obstacle
to any genuine discussion on an insti-
tution that’s “been historical, religious.
and legal in this country for many, many
years” (again, Reince Priebus).

My only claim is that in the great
social questions of America’s past, true
leaders of astounding courage chose
their side and accepted the consequenc-
es. There was no question where the
people listed above stood on the issues
of their day.

You, however, have opted to take
a bystander’s position while others on
both sides of the issue—Republiean and
Democrat, conservative and liberal»
sacriﬁce their time, careers, and reputa-
tions to try and resolve it. Regardless of
one’s opinion on gay marriage, your ac-
tions are ones of apathy at best and cow-
ardice at worst. »

*Note from the Author:

I am a voting Republican, and a be-
lieving Episcopalian. I have yet to form
my own solid stance on the issue of gay
marriage. I do, however, believe that the
government has no business regulating
the institution of marriage via licenses.
Furthermore, I am proudly opposed to
the policy of “Don’t Ask Don‘t Tell,” I
do not believe that homosexuality is a

choice. nor that it can be “cured” in any

WNL? presents live Spring Show

Wednesday Night Live,

By Gabrielle Tremo
STAFF WRITER

“What did the farmer say when he
lost his‘ tractor?” Pause. “‘Where’s my
tractor?” Cue laughter. Thisjoke set the
stage for Wednesday Night Live’s perfor-
mance this Saturday night in the Stack-
house Theater. Wednesday Night Live
(WNL) is Washington and Lee’s most
active and only sketch comedy group
on campus. Making its last appearance
of the year, WNL had a great line-up of
student written, directed, and performed
sketches.

WNL’s chemical equation includes
one part Saturday Night Live, two parts
W&L events, and three parts ﬂawless
satire. The plays are written by the stu-
dents, for the students, and include jabs
at awkward friendships, the stereotypical
W&L student, broken gender relation-
ships, and even classic internet memes.

‘During its last act. the performance even

had a very impressive skit about the poor

writing-style of The Ring-tum Phi. After
that skit; I went up to Jeb Purcell, ﬁrst-
year author of many of the skits (includ-
ing the piece about The‘ Phi), and asked
him a couple of questions, noting how
many of the pieces portrayed classic
W&L life. ' -

“it’s not necessarily what we want,”
Purcell said, “but it’s what people want.
What plays best for audiences is W&L
stuff. it’s relatable; it has to be univer-
sal.”

That is exactly what these skits were.

Who hasn’t had a conversation with»

someone who keeps using hashtags as if
it were part of their language? Or who
hasn’t had that one “best friend” who you
would rather be more than just a “best
friend?” Or who hasn’t gone through
The Phi looking for typos, pretending
it’s a game? (Find ﬁve in my article and
H1 give you a quarter).

However, they also had some other
skits thatawhile not as relatable—‘ were
absolutely hilarious. What happens when
the guy who does every voice over for
the Hollywood trailers tries to ﬁnd a job
at Best Buy? Or how will Mike & Ike’s
come up with a new marketing strategy
to get above 6th place in the non—choc-
olate candy ranking? A particular audi-
ence favorite was how would Cleopa-
tra’s life been different if she had a Sassy
Gay Friend (apparently Mark Antony is
a stupid b!@#$)? These were the exact
same questions that WNL asked,

Despite having relatively little time
to come up with these questions due to
being assembled rather quickly, WNL
put on a great show. “Spring term’s been
hectic,” Purcell said. “It’s been hard to
get everyone together.”

The night of the performance was
the ﬁrst time the whole troupe had per-

formed some of the skits together as a
whole. Regardless, the satire was ﬂaw-
less, the message still pointed, the com-
edy still brilliant. The wit in some of the
skits shone through in both the irony and
in the reality.

A particularly provocative skit was
one depicting the SJC as a male—domi-
nated, misogynistic committee in which
the group judged the students based on
hotness of body—— and how these cus-
toms and traditions were received by the
new, singular female representative on
the committee.

My favorite was a modern represen-
tation of how technology had invaded
our lives. It focused on a date between
a young man and woman in which the
woman would end every sentence with
“hashtag [insert punchline here].” Below
is a sample piece of dialogue:

“You can’t say one thing and then

W&L ’s best (and only) sketchy Comedy group, delivered a double dose of satire and wit

have it mean something completely dif-
ferent?!”

“I don’t think that’s what I’m do-
ing—hashtag, duh.”

The performance was all-in-all hi-
larious and well-received. The audience
gave a standing ovation to the group of
students who had crammed countless re-
hearsals into busy schedules and braved
the stage of sketch comedy— which, as
every group from SNL to WNL knows—
can be either kind or unforgiving. Con-
gratulations to each member of WNL on
ajob well done!

Make sure to stay in touch with WNL
and look for their first performance of
the year next semester.

Beta boasts ﬁne dining experience

Beta takes fraternity cooking to a new level and proves that house meals can be classy. Now there is some food for thought.

Fraternity cooking took another evo-,

lutionary step this year towards ﬁne din-
ing. On March 28, members of the Beta
Theta Pi fraternity were treated to a full-
llcdgcd restaurant style dinner.

Members of the fraternity were noti-
tied a week in advance to schedule a res-
ervation time of either 5:30 or 7:00 pm
and were encouraged to bring dates. The
dining room was preset with linens on ta-
bles and formal place settings, including
two different types of forks and spoons.
The place settings also included decora-
tive ﬁowers and appropriate plates for
appetizers and desserts. The experience
also included a full service wait staff.

The meal consisted of three differ-
ent courses. The appetizer was a Shrimp
ljscabeche with a side of green peppers,
plum tomatoes and Manzilla Olives. The
main course was a choice between a Tri-
tip Beefsteak with dark onion sauce or
roasted duck breast with Amontillado
Kirsh, and both were served with a side
of lobster and crab risotto and zucchini
Provencal. The dessert featured choices
of Chocolate Mousse Bundt, Hazelnut
Ganache and Raspberry-mascarpone
Coppa.

This menu was inspired by the Cu-
linary Institute of America, which Julia
Child deemed as the “Harvard of culi-
nary schools.” Having recently taken an
exam at the institute, Chef John Stallard
was inspired to provide the fraternity
with a real restaurant experience. The

menu, reserved seating at 5:30 and 7:00 pm, and were encouraged to bring dates to the fancy occasion.

Beta’s first-ever restaurant themed dinner on March 28th. Th

ingredients were mostly taken from 10-
cal sellers and a premium was placed
on fresh ingredients. As Stallard noted,
“Pre-fabricated food doesn’t taste as

‘ good as fresh made food.”

Planning the event was an arduous
and laborious task, but also an exciting
one. The dinner itselftook about a week
to prepare, and the restaurant atmosphere
and food preparation took the entire day.

Marking the night as a success, Stal-
lard hopes to do another restaurant-
themed night next year, and more frater-
nities will follow suit. Looking for more
options in the future as well as a sous
chef to help with the heavy workload,
Chef Stallard believed that the restaurant

experience done in a fraternity house can

continue to evolve and expand.

Beyond just a ﬁne dining experi-
ence, the restaurant—themed dinner was
another step in the continued evolution
of fraternity dining. Stallard was one of
many fraternity chefs who believed that
the food at the fraternity houses was not
supposed to simply be a gluttonous af-
terthought.

“I want students to experience their
food, and maybe chew a little slower to
get everything the food is about,” said
Stallard. I -

Stallard would also like wine at
next yearls event, but noted that since
alcohol-free wine has yet to become in
vogue, the deans might not approve of
the complete dining experience.

7 ‘ THE RING-TUM PHI -

JON GUEST

Professional football is a North American tradition. For years,the
Super Bowl has reigned supreme in the world of professional sport-
ing events, and for many people Sunday afternoons would seem
irrelevant without the opportunity to sit in front of a television set
watching their favorite team step onto the ﬁeld to do battle.

Unfortunately, recent studies have suggested that the term “bat-
tle” is more telling than we may have realized; hundreds of cur-

sports

The recent death of Junior Seau has brought more attention to player
safety issues in the NFL and the potentially chronic side effects that
players may develop after a career’s worth of violent collisions. But
while evidence of football’s harmful toll on the body grows, there is
little that the NFL’s rules committee can do without fundamentally
changing the game.

, Some former NFL players are now imploring officials to clean
up the game. Their concerns stem from an increasing number of play-

knocked out of you, or to feel a little bit dazed aﬂer a hard tackle.
If the administration is honest with itself, I just don’t see how they
can counter the argument that player safety is simply not possible.
Football is a contact sport, and NFL players are certainly capable of protecting themselves...
most of the ‘time. When given the best equipment and top notch medical staff, they are able to
minimize the occurrence of extreme injury. In addition, the millions of dollars that they are paid
seem to poke holes in the argument that players are taken advantage of. Surely there are thousands
of people who would leap at the chance to participate on the grand stage. The problem
with this claim is that it puts a price tag on well be- i ‘- ‘. ing and possibly on
life. 1 don’t think that it is ever a good idea to justify . “ shedding years
oft” of lives for mere dollars. Framed in this man- . ner, it is easier
to see why the situation is inappropriate. Can we le- gitimately con-
sider the question of how much we would need to be paid to give
up one year of our lives? Even the aspiring profes- sional athlete is
unlikely to jump at that deal.

   
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  

As dangerous as it can be, I don’t think that the biggest con-

ers developing chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a debilitating
neurological condition, during the latter stages of their lives. The disorder arises from an accumulation
of concussions sustained over multiple NFL seasons.

As research reveals more worrying results, certain ex-players like Kurt Wamer—who suffered many
concussions during his playing days—say they will not allow their children to play football. Others re-
mark that had they known the severity of harm football could do to their bodies, they may have pursued
a different career.

Criticism of the game, the league’s rules and education of players has notably come from these play-
ers rather than fans. While supporters may hate to see their favorite players from the past struggle to
complete interviews because their short-term memory is so impaired, they also want to see their favorite
sport playedevery Sunday in all its glory. That is, fans love crunching blocks, ferocious tackles, and
players carrying on despite injury.

Football is a game for warriors, and America’s obsession with it conveys a tacit approval of the harm-
ful circumstances to which players expose themselves each week. Fans ultimately reinforce the violent
nature of the game, because rule changes that might reduce some of the game’s physicality would turn
them off from the sport. Big hits are big business, and the league wants to keep fans happy with its
product. ”

Rule changes to protect quarterbacks and receivers running across the middle of the ﬁeld have helped
reduce the risk of injury for some players. More cushioned helmets have also helped reduce the likeli-
hood of concussions. Protective legislation and technological improvements, however, can only go so
far to protect players when violence remains an essential element of football.

The NFL needs to address its problems by increasing awareness. Just as people who smoke now do
so with full understanding of the perils, players need to be fully aware of football’s detrimental effects.
The beneﬁts will outweigh the risks for some, but the scientiﬁc ﬁndings that keep arising need to be more
transparent.

Players and fans can also help the issue by changing the NFL’s culture. Many analysts who used to
play in the league explain the pressure on players to play through injuries or rush back from major opera-
tions. The body needs time to heal properly. Perhaps empirical evidence showing the beneﬁts of full
rest and recovery will help justify players who choose to sit out with a concussion instead of returning to
the gridiron and risking further injury. ,

While overhauling the game to protect players makes sense, the reality is that most fans and players
relish the sport’s physicality too much for it to go away. Officials, then, must continue to look aﬁer play-
ers left in vulnerable situations, make more improvements to players’ equipment, increase the awareness
of potentially debilitating cumulative injuries, and help players become morehonest evaluators of their
own health.

Generals can’t control Eagles

W&L gives up nine to open the second half

By Leigh Dannhauser
SPORTS EDITOR

Washington and Lee fell to Mary Washington
16-8 in the opening round of the NCAA touma-
ment on Wednesday.

The Generals jumped out to an early 4-1 lead on
two unassisted goals by senior Christina Benedetti.

The Eagles were able to respond and closed the
gap. The Generals were up 6-5 entering halftime’.

Mary Washington came out in the second half
ﬁghting. They, scored nine unanswered goals.
W&L was unable to score until Benedetti scored
unassisted with 5:12 remaining in the game.

Senior Catherine Kennedy of Mary Washington
scored four goals during the streak. Kennedy led
the way for the Eagles with a game-high ﬁve goals
and a game-high three assists. Senior Lauren Cal-
lison added three goals while three players each
scored two for the Eagles.

One of the biggest differences between the ﬁrst
and second half for W&L was turnovers. The Gen-

erals turned the ball over just four times in the ﬁrst
half, one less than the Eagles. In the second half
alone W&L turned the ball over ten times.

The turnover discrepancy allowed for Mary
Washington to take more shots as well. In the ﬁrst
half both teams attempted 12 shots on goal. In the
second half Mary Washington outshot the Generals
by eight. Mary Washington was able to attempt 17
shots compared to W&L’s 9.

In addition, Benedetti led the way for the Gen-
erals with a team-high three goals. Sophomores
Meade Brewster and Margaret Klein each contrib-
uted two goals.

With the loss the Generals are done for the sea-
son. They ﬁnished with a 15-5 record with an Old
Dominion Athletic Conference championship title.

Mary Washington fell to Cortland 12-5 in the
second round game. The Eagles ﬁnished their sea-
son with a 14-4 record.
