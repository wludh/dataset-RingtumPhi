Hartog named
admissions director

William M. Hartog, formerly dean of ad-
missions at Rollins College in Florida, was

named director of admissions at
Washington and Lee effective July 15.

Hartog, 31, succeeds James D. Farrar,
who had been W&L’s admissions director
for 16 years. Farrar was named in March to
organize and direct a new program design-
ed to involve W&L alumni intensively in the
undergraduate recruiting and admissions
process.

The new W&L admissions director has
been head of admissions at Rollins since
1972, first as director and with the title of
dean since earlier this year.

He is widely active in professional
organizations and is president- elect of the
Southern Association of College Admissions
Counselors and conference chairman for
that group’s annual meeting ths year.

Hartog’s appointment was announced by
Dr. Lewis G. John’ dean of students. Admis-
sions activities at Washington and Lee are
part of that office’s responsibilities.

A search is currently underway to fill the
newly created position of associate admis-
sions director, Dr. John said.

(A detailed feature on Mr. Hartog, writ-
ten by editorial staff member, Neil Pen-
tifallo, will appear on Thursday. )

Chinese “‘variety show”
to be held in chapel

A troupe of 16 college students from the Republic of
China (Taiwan) will visit Lexington next week and will
present a free public performance Thursday afternoon
(Sept. 14).

The students are beginning a cultural-exchange tour
of the United States. Washington and Lee has main-
tained close cultural-exchange ties with Taiwan for a
number of years now, highlighted by a week-long visit
by a number of W&L representatives to Taiwan this
summer.

The visiting students will give a number of brief
demonstrations of authentic Chinese art forms, rang-
ing from dance to acrobatics. They will play Chinese
instrumental.music and offer excerpts from the
distinctive Chinese opera. Also part of the per-
formance will be a series of colorful folk dances of the
traditional Taiwanese aboriginal form.

The cultural ‘‘variety show’’ will take place on the
new terrace in front of Lee Chapel at W&L, weather
permitting. If the weather is bad, the show will be held
inside the Chapel.

The program begins at 3:30 p.m., and will be follow-
ed immediately by a tea reception in the W&L Alumni
House, to which the public is also invited.

During their visit to Lexington, the students will be
the guests of Washington and Lee’s Asian Studies Pro-
gram.

freshman class arrives

Classes begin Wednesday for an estimated 1,350 undergraduate students at Washington and Lee.
With 384 freshmen registering this week, W&L has one of the largest entering classes in its history. Generally in
the recent past, W&L has had freshman classes varying in size from about 350 to 365, the range the university con-

siders ideal.

The unusually large freshman class this year, W&L officials say, is the result of a much higher-than-expected
“confirmation rate’ among applicants to whom W&L offered admission last spring. The rate for this fall’s entering
class was 57 percent, 10 points higher than a year ago and significantly higher than any year in at least the past

decade anda half.

Because of the unusually large freshman class, W&L
has leased part of the old Robert E. Lee hotel for use as
freshman housing, and 31 members of the entering
class will live there.

Statistical data for the new freshman class show that
its members are at least as well qualified academical-
ly, as measured by objective data, as last year’s
normal-size freshman class. Combined College Board
scores (Scholastic Achievement Test — SAT) were vir-
tually the same as a year ago, 1,129 this year versus
1,130 last September. The required English composi-
tion Achievement Test score was up slightly for this
year’s freshman class, at 546, against an average score
of 544 last year.

The ‘“‘average’’ W&L freshman this year ranked in
the top quarter of his high- school class at a mean stan-
ding of 73.7 on a base of 100, and 42 percent of this
year’s freshmen graduated in the top one-fifth of their
high-school classes.

Orientation for the new freshmen officially began
Wednesday, Sept. 6, and the incoming freshmen
departed Thursday for the traditional two days of
meetings at Natural Bridge.

News Briefs

The Algernon Sydney Sullivan prize, the highest
award the Washington and Lee University faculty con-
fers upon a graduating student, was presented to
Richard W. Stein of Jacksonville, Fla.

Stein, majoring in both psychology and religion, was
head of the University Federation and chairman of the
Big Brother volunteer programs and was coordinator
of a tutoring program in the local elementary schools
and of a companion therapy program at the Western
State mental hospital in Staunton, Va. He also worked
at the Presbyterian Children’s Home in Lexington.

The Sullivan Award, sponsored by The Southern
Society of New York, recognizes the graduating stu-
dent ‘‘who excels in high ideals of living, in spiritual
qualities, and in generous and disinterested service to
others.”

W&L has hired 11 new professors who will begin
regular teaching duties this week. Equally distributed
between the undergraduate departments and the law
school, they will be profiled in the first issue of the
Ring-tum Phi. Incidentally, one of the new
undergraduate instructors is a woman, bringing the
number of ‘‘teaching females’’ on the main campus to
an all-time high of five.

Classes for the law school opened August 21, with a
record-breaking enrollment of 344. This represents a
40% increase in the law student body over the past
three years, made possible after the move from Tucker
to Lewis Hall in 1976.

According to law school officials, the number of law
students is now expected to stabilize at 340-350 from
this year.

The first-year law class includes 115 individuals from
68 colleges and 28 states, about 30 percent of which are
women.

 

Former W&L
athlete killed

Christopher R. Larson, a 1977 graduate of
Washington and Lee, was fatally injured in an accident
on August 11 on the Baltimore heltway.

Larson, 22, was a standout athlete in his four years at
W&L. He was a leading midfielder on the Generals’ na-
tionally ranked lacrosse team, scoring 12 goals and 8
assists his senior year when W&L ranked fifth in the
country.

Larson also played basketball at W&L and served as
the Generals’ valuable sixth man in 1976-77 when his
team set a school record of 23 wins and 5 losses.

He was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Emory E. Larson of
Lutherville, Maryland.

From the editor

All of us on the 1978-79 newspaper staff
take this opportunity to welcome the up-
perclassmen who have returned to the grind
— and a special welcome to this year’s
freshman class.

The Ring-tum Phi, entering its 78th year
of publication, is one of the oldest college
newspapers in the country. Distributed
every Thursday on campus, it provides
regular coverage of the major events on
campus — and the people who make them
happen. An open forum for opinion, we
solicit articles and letters from all areas of
the student body and administration. In ad-
dition, town affairs which affect all of you
will be reported throughout the year.

It is our goal to provide a publication
which will act as a ready guide to happen-
ings at W&L — the who, what, where, when,
and why. In the past two years, the Ring-
tum Phi has grown in size by over 100 per-
cent, and there is now the physical space to
cover the news in a more detailed fashion.
In this regard, thanks are especially due to
the Lexington News-Gazette, which took
over the printing of the expanded paper in
1977.

However bright the year may be for our
publication, there is always a need for addi-
tional staff members. Regular assignments
for reporters in all departments (news,
sports, entertainment, features) are
waiting and require no previous experience.
In addition, positions on the editorial staff
are available for those who qualify. And our
business manager, Peter Goss, will be tak-
ing several new people into the advertising,
subscription, and circulation operations.
None of these jobs require demanding
amounts of time; yet, they are an excellent
way (especially for freshmen) to get involv-
ed on campus.

If you are interested, make your move
quickly — before all the best assignments
are taken. Sign up at the matriculation
table on Mon-Tues, Sept. 11-12. Also, all are
invited to attend the first open staff
meeting: Thursday, September 14, at 4pm
in the newspaper office, Room 200 of the
University Center building. At this meeting,
assignments will be given out for the second
issue, and new reporters will be introduced
to their various department editors.

I believe that we have assembled an ex-
cellent central staff for the year. All that re-
mains is for those of you who are interested
to make your presence known. I look for-
ward to meetinn you during the week, and
at the meeting on Thursday afternoon.

Robert E. R. Huntley (right), president of Washington and Lee University, received the Cultural Decoration
from the Republic of China (Taiwan) at a formal ceremony in Taipei.
The medal is the highest honor of its type the nationalist Chinese government can confer on a foreigner.

Huntley’s was only the 11th ever awarded.

Presenting the decoration is Chu Hwei-sen, the Chinese minister of education. The ceremony took place in

Taiwan’s National Museum of History.

The award recognizes a broad variety of cultural and academic exchange programs between Washington and

Lee and the Republic of China.

WE&L brings Reeves Collection to Taiwan

As usual, the departure of the students in June brings
a strange quiet to Washington and Lee. But several
university figures created excitement by leading a ma-
jor cultural tour to Taiwan, bringing W&L to the
headlines of newspapers a hemisphere away.

An exhibition of porcelain art objects exported from
China 150 to 250 years ago opened July 16 in the
Republic of China — marking the first time, according
to the Nationalist Chinese ambassador to the United
States, that the Chinese people had the opportunity to
see for themselves the art which formed an important
part of their ancestors’ foreign trade.

The 100 porcelain objects are from W&L’s Reeves
Collection of Chinese Export Porcelain, donated to the
university 11 years ago. A major part of the collection,
which contains 2,000 items in all, has been on a United
States tour since 1974, and it is now regarded as one of
the most important collections of its kind.

The Reeves Collection, which contains 2,000
porcelain items in all, was donated to Washington and
Lee in 1967 by Euchlin D. and Louise Herreshoff
Reeves of Providence, R.I., who had spent their entire
married life assembling the collection. Mr. Reeves was
a 1927 graduate of the Washington and Lee law school.

The exhibition in Taiwan grew out of the interest of
the Chinese ambassador to the United States, James C.
H. Shen, and his wife, who first saw the Reeves Collec-
tion — the first Chinese export porcelain they had ever
seen — when it had its premiere exhibition in Norfolk
in 1974 in connection with the American Bicentennial.

Mr. and Mrs. Shen subsequently visited Lexington to

Glee Club auditions

The Glee Club of Washington and Lee has a busy
year ahead of it, including concerts with Sweet Briar,
Hollins, and Meredith Colleges. The Washington Holi-
day tour will feature visits to New Orleans and Atlanta,
and there will be campus appearances at Parents’
Weekend, Christmas, and Baccalaureate.

The club has openings in both the tenor and bass sec-
tions and auditions for new members will be held Mon-
day through Thursday, September 11 through 14 from
4:00 to 5:30 in the music room of the student center.

Dr. Gordon Spice, director of the Glee Club, invites
any W&L student to audition, whether he has had any
previous singing experience or not.

LSAT NOTICE

All students interested in taking the Law School Ad-
mission Test for entrance into law school in 1979 should
remember that the first administration of the test will
be on October 14 on the W&L campus.

Applications to take the test must be postmarked no
later than September 14 .

view the permanent collection while the Bicentennial
selections were on a nationwide tour sponsored by the
Smithsonian Institution. The Shens also presented a
number of original and reproduction art works to
Washington and Lee as a gift from the Republic of
China.

According to Shen, ‘‘Under ordinary circumstances,
sending porcelain to China would be like carrying coals
to Newcastle, because it was in China that porcelain
originated, many centuries ago.”’

But because the items in the W&L collection were
made specifically for export, he said, ‘‘most Chinese
people have never seen them before.”’

The pieces loaned by Washington and Lee to the Na-
tional Museum of History in Taipei — the Nationalist
Chinese provisional capital, located on the island of
Taiwan — represent the most important kinds of
decorative patterns from the early trade between
China and the United States following the Revolu-
tionary War.

Among the items, for instance, is a dinner plate own-
ed by George Washington, and pieces owned by other
Revolutionary heroes. Other pieces in W&L’s Chinese
exhibit combined traditional Chinese designs such as
the flower-and-butterfly ‘Fitzhugh’ with American
eagles, flags and similar patriotic scenes and
emblems.

Also instrumental in arranging the Taiwan exhibi-
tion was Prof. I-Hsiung Ju, artist-in- residence at
Washington and Lee, a native of China and a leading
Chinese artist who has long been associated with the
National Museum.

Representing Washington and Lee at the opening in
Taiwan July 16 were President and Mrs. Robert E. R.
Huntley; Prof. and Mrs. Ju; and James W. Whitehead,
university treasurer and curator of the Reeves Collec-
tion, with Mrs. Whitehead.

Fraternity President Arrested

Lexington’s Noise Ordinance brings
early end to Saturday night party

by Randy Smith

The president of Sigma Chi
fraternity, Tim Brooks, was ar-
rested Saturday night by Lex-
ington police for violation of the
city’s noise ordinance.

Saturday night’s arrest
represents the most severe ac-
tion taken thus far by the Lex-
ington police department in en-
forcing the city’s noise laws.

In a court hearing on the case
Tuesday morning, Judge
Joseph E. Hess of the Lexington
General District Court dismiss-

Three times in one week

Brooks had received a warn-
ing that the music was too loud
at a Sigma Chi party the
previous Tuesday. Later that
evening he was given a sum-
mons to appear in court for
violation of Lexington’s noise
law.

City ordinance 15-32(b) for-
bids noise more than 50 feet
from its point of origin between
the hours of 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.
Violation of the law can carry a
penalty of up to $1,000 and/or
one year in jail.

Brooks was not given a warn-
ing Saturday night, however,
and was arrested shortly after
he turned on his fraternity’s
stereo system at 11:15 p.m.

The arresting officer was
Lexington policeman Jack C.
Purvis, who had also issued a
summons to Brooks and Sigma

Leach has devised a way of
transfering McCormick
Library’s 250,000 volumes to the
new facility. As soon as exams
are completed (Dec. 15), the
move will begin; for the next 3
weeks, items such as the card
catalog, bound periodicals and
oversize books, and 40-50% of
the stack books will leave Mc-
Cormick. University employees
will carry out most of this first
phase.

But ‘“‘phase two” is a com-
pletely different story, ac-
cording to Leach. At the first
faculty meeting in October,
there will be a request to sus-
pend all classes on Wednesday,
January 10. On this day,
students, faculty, and
townspeople will be invited to
assist in moving the remainder
of the books—as Leach calls it,
“a total W&L project,”’ capable
only on a campus of this size
and character.

Leach has conferred with all
but two academic departments
on the “moving day”’ plan, and
is encouraged by the en-
thusiastic response down the
line.

How will the move be ac-
complished? As Leach describ-
ed it, “There will be so many

some way. By charts which we
have been working on for some

With the new undergraduate

Christmas, the first major step
has been made in what will be a
series of ‘‘departmental

the past several years, pro-

Ring-tum Phi Interview

 

Jim Davis speaks out on Rush

The _ Interfraternity Council
reported Tuesday night that 393
students registered for this year’s
fraternity rush which includes
nintey-nine percent of _ the
freshman class. Because of the
importance of this yearly ritual,
the Ring-tum Phi interviewed
Jim Davis, IFC president, for his
general thoughts on the fraternity
rush process at Washington and
Lee.

Q:There have been a number
of changes this year in fraterni-
ty rush, particularly in the
length of rush itself. Can you ex-
plain some of this and the
reasons behind the changes?

Davis: The biggest change is
that there is now one week in
between open houses and the
first rush dates. Last year, the
open houses were held on the
weekends and then the first
rush dates were the next
Wednesday. This year, there is
time for people to see a lot more
of the fraternity houses and get
to know more people.

The administration was also
unhappy about having a rush
date last year the night before
classes began, and lots of
freshmen didn’t show up for the
first day of classes. So we’ve
compromised with the Ad-
ministration to have contact

 

Jim Davis, IFC President, speaks with news staff in this issue.

Q: The rush system itself
seems very short and intensive.
Do you think one week is a long
enough time for fraternities to
get to know freshmen or for
freshmen to make up their
minds about fraternities?

Davis: Yes, I think most
freshmen should be able to
make up their minds within one

their minds.

Q: If rush is such an impor-
tant decision for a freshman, do
you think he will learn enough
to make the proper decision in
just one week?

Davis: If rush were drawn out
over a longer period of time,
most houses would just have a

“The process of rush is the best opportunity at

Washington and Lee to meet a large number of
people in such a short period of time.”

ed procedure, so it was extend-
ed. But now no one feels that an
extension of more than a week
is really necessary.

However, the extension this
year is basically an experi-
ment. It could lead to a further
lengthening of the rush process
in the future.

It’s hard to get feedback on
the effectiveness of rush,
though. Most of the freshmen
are satisfied once they join a
house and they forget about the
hassle they went through.

Washington and Lee?

Davis: The process of rush is
the best opportunity at
Washington and Lee to meet a
large number of people in such
a short period of time. It’s also
unique in that all fraternities
are cordial to one another after
rush ends. You can have friends
in all houses and not be isolated
from them. It makes for a more
close-knit community.

Q: What about the enforce-
ment of rush violations?

“Rush is a state of mind that
the fraternity has.”

 

Q: What about the idea of
having rush in winter term,
after Christmas break, as a way
of getting to know the freshmen
better and not making rush so
intensive?

Davis: That idea was brought
up, but was quickly dismissed
when houses pointed out the
financial side of rush. Basical-
ly, houses need the freshmen,
and they need the money from
the freshmen’s dues. That’s
why rush isn’t after Christmas:
houses need the money sooner
than that to survive.

Q: What would you consider
unique about the rush system at

Davis: The fraternities pro-
vide a good check and balance
in a lot cf instances where the
IFC cannot really police things.
Everybody wants to see a fair
rush and are perfectly willing to
report any blatant violations.
It’s something they themselves
will refrain from doing because
they don’t think it’s fair.

I think we've given frater-

nities a bit more freedom this
year in rush. We're asking them
to use their own discretion in
following the rules of rush tak-
ing the burden off the IFC and
making rush less regulated and
more loose and relaxed.

longer facade. Rush is a state of
mind that the fraternity has.
The houses are out to show their
best faces and out to be as
friendly as possible to the
freshmen. I think that their
friendliness would continue as
long as they thought they had to
for rush.

Also, there has always tradi-
tionally been a short intensive
rush period at the beginning of
school. Many houses last year
thought rush was a really rush-

Fraternity

Last spring, the Board of
Trustees and the Administra-
tion began emphasizing the
need for improvement in the ap-
pearance and safety features of
fraternities. According to Dan
Murphy,, Assistant Dean in
charge of fraternity affairs,
“Our main concerns are for the
safety and health of fraternity
members.”’ The school ac-
tively supported this position by
making $150,000 in loans to
various fraternities to finance
new construction. These loans
bring the school’s total invest-
ment in fraternities to $650,000.

Most of the problems lie in the
area of safety and health,
especially fire safety. The
deteriorated condition of the
outside of several houses was
also the target of criticism.
Murphy says, ‘‘The fraternities
represent W&L. The poor ap-
pearance of houses hurts the

Details of the budget over-
runs will come out at Monday’s
Executive Committee meeting
which the Ring-tum Phi will

school’s alumni relations, rela-

tions with the town, as well as
efforts to recruit new students.”’

Each fraternity was given a
spot inspection and received a
list of priority items. Some
items required immediate at-
tention while others were long
range in nature. The frater-
nities are required to file pro-
gress reports with the school
and are subject to disciplinary
action for noncompliance.

Over the summer, several
houses made improvements
which bring them in line with
school standards. Both FIJI and
Lambda Chi are in the process
of having fire escapes installed.
Delta Tau Delta had a panic bar
placed on their back door and
Sigma Nu had their electrical
systems rewired in order to
meet fire safety standards.
Plumbing and gutter work were
also common, with Pi Kappa
Phi, Phi Delta Theta, K A,

Lambda Chi, FIJI, and SPE all
having some kind of work done.

Many fraternities took steps
to improve their appearance.
SPE had their exterior painted
and did extensive plaster work
inside. Pi Kappa Phi and Phi
Kappa Sigma both installed
new roofs and had work done on
eves and shudders. Pi Kappa
Phi and Sigma Nu had exten-
sive interior plasterwork done
to repair old walls, while Sigma
Nu and Phi Delta Theta had
their balconies and columns
repaired and painted.

Dan Murphy is pleased with
the progress fraternities have
made towards reflecting a more
favorable image of the school.
He says, ‘Fraternities are
strongly supported and _ en-
couraged by the school but must
live up to responsible standards
for this relationship to continue
into the future.”’

site of the language lab is slated
to become the Music 151
classroom, and the listening
room will occupy DuPont 205.
(These two operations are
presently taking place in one
overcrowded room of McCor-
mick.) The remainder of Du-
Pont will contain the following
features: basement—an office
for W&L’s cramped artist-in-
residence, Prof. Ju; second
floor-studio-offices for music
faculty and all music practice
facilities from the University
Center Basement; third floor -
tentatively scheduled for
transformation into one large
rehearsal hall for music and
drama.

The major exit from DuPont
Hall will be by the psychology
department. (German and
philosophy have been moved in
the past year.) The laboratory
rats, and their cohorts, are
scheduled to take the entire
basement level of Tucker Hall
as their new home—bumping
the entire computer center into
the ground floor of that facility.
German and romance
languages will continue to fill
the upper floors of Tucker Hall.
(The changes outlined here are

scheduled to take place after
the 1978-79 academic year.)

If you have remained alert in
the midst of this chaos, you
should have noticed that we left
the language lab without a
home several paragraphs
earlier. Rest assured that they
found a new one over the sum-
mer. Old-timers call it the moot
courtroom in Tucker Hall;
those more recent know it
primarily as the place where
Dr. Futch holds court. At any
rate, Professor Russell Knud-
son and his lab are now perched
at the top of Tucker with the
best view of the new library.

The double-size, all-carpeted
language lab was designed en-
tirely by Knudson and
represents, in his words, ‘‘a top-
notch facility, the best that
money can buy.”’ He noted the
university’s encouraging at-
titude toward the liberal arts:
“There were really no holds
barred. From a separate visual
area to a soundproofed recor-
ding studio, I can say it is one of
the greatest facilities of its
kind.”

Knudson, who has been work-
ing on this transfer literally
every day since commence-
ment in June, saved his

Professor Russell Knudson, shown in the new language laboratory is already a major beneficiary of the

movement on campus.

Rush Fines Set

Three of Washington and
Lee’s social fraternities receiv-
ed major fines from the Inter-
fraternity Council’s (IFC)
Judicial Board for violation of
the IFC’s Rush regulations.

Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, and Zeta Beta Tau
fraternities were fined $150 for
having members in_ the
freshman dormatories at the
improper time.

Phi Kappa Sigma and Delta
Tau Delta were both fined $20
because members were drink-
ing hard alcohol during the

Saturday night open houses.
The original fine for such an of-
fense was $150, but was reduced
because of a misunderstanding
of the rule. The Judicial Board
has now ruled that there will be
no consumption of hard alcohol
by fraternity members at the
remaining rush functions; beer
will be permitted.

Phi Gamma Delta fraternity
was also fined $20 because their
rush official passed out from
drunkenness while performing
his duties at Pi Kappa Phi
Saturday night.

as it will be next summer:
psychology, languages, com-
puters.

At the other end of the Colon-
nade is the building most in
need of structural restoration:
Newcomb Hall. When this
structure is vacant (approx. fall
1980), we enter another phase of
the university’s planning. In the
words of Frank Parsons, assis-
tant to the President, “No
departments have _ been
definitely assigned space in
Newcomb”’ (which will require
a good deal of repair work).
“However, we do intend to
make it available to the
‘homeless departments’ in the
College.”’

The “homeless departments”
are those scattered aimlessly
about the campus. And when
you think of these, the likely
favorite appears to be history,
the largest of them all. Though
strictly tentative, it is true that
a history move would free
spaces all over campus for use
by other operations. (Other
departments mentioned by Par-

sons as_ candidates for
Newcomb Hall include
philosophy, sociology, or
classics. )

In the meantime, there has
been a great exodus from
Washington Hall. The entire

Dean of Students operation
(Deans John, Huntley, Murphy,
Mrs. Miller) is now at the rear
of Payne Hall. According to
Dean Jo “We've been era

overlapping of work and calls is
tremendous.”’ Admissions will
fill the entire suite of
Washington Hall, but Dean
John and friends may not be in
Payne Hall forever. It is rumor
only (but a persistent one) that
if the history department
vacated the top floor of
Washington Hall, the Dean of
Students might return to the
central building in that location.
The game goes onward—by
now we have reached beyond
the three to four year mark. But
there is no end to conjecture:
restoration of DuPont and
Tucker Annexes back into their
original use as faculty homes;
the use of one of the two an-
nexes aS a separate ‘‘admis-
sions house,” getting that
operation out of the
mainstream of traffic
altogether; increased student
office space in the student
center basement—and so forth
The facts on these changes
are legion; worse than confus-
ing, they are often contradic-
tory. Even so, with restoration
of McCormick library set for
early 1979, many professors will
begin to dust off the furniture
for a move of some sort. It is,
without a doubt, the most in-
tricate dance the university has
ever performed for the com-
munity. Whether the dust will

New Theater Building Approved

Possible site is near old railroad station

Dr. Albert Gordon, Chairman
of the Fine Arts Department at
W&L, recently announced that
investigation has finally begun
into the proposed building of a
new drama center. In the
spring, the Board of Trustees
officially recognized the need
for such a facility. And after
further research, an architect
will soon be arriving to examine
several tentative sites for a new
theatre building.

Of all the probable areas, the
prominent site to be examined
at this time is a tract of land on
Nelson St. behind Doremus
Gymnasium, adjacent to the old
railroad station. The station is
already owned by the university
and is used for storage by the
drama department. One of
several tentative plans calls for
restoration of the railroad sta-
tion as drama offices and
classrooms, next to the
auditorium facility.

At this time, there are no
funds raised for such a project,
but it is important to note that
this drama complex is the only
new building comtemplated for
construction in the near future.

According to University of-
ficials, there are several ad-
vantages to the Nelson St. loca-
tion. Aside from the presence of
the station building, the slight

   

    
      

distance from the main campus
would make a freer architec-
tural style possible. In addition,
outlying parking facilities
would be available for the many
activities possible in a larger
theatre.

The drama department cur-
rently exists in the Troubadour
Theatre (a former livery stabie
and, according to stories, a
bordello) and the Boiler
Room—named for its earlier
life as the basement of a laun-
dry. To say that the facilities
are grossly inadequate would
stop short of understatement,
but an inventive faculty has us-
ed them in a variety of novel
ways—in productions from
King Lear, Othello, and The
Tempest, to Uncle Vanya,
Three Penny Opera, A Street-
car Named Desire, and Death
of a Salesman. Starting in 1965
with the arrival of professor
Lee Kahn, shop space was ex-
panded, a lobby was built on the
Troubadour, and the Boiler
Room was rented in 1976.

Even so, all have been aware
that these are but temporary
solutions—especially with the
W&L drama program growing
significantly year by year. Long
before the Board of Trustees
voted its approval to further
research, Dr. Gordon had a
description of the ideal teaching

  

facility for W&L Theatre:

*a large proscenium-thrust
auditorium to seat approx-
imately 300 people.

*a smaller, black-box or “‘ex-
perimental’’ theater to seat 100.

*rehearsal hall and offices.

“increased shop space, with
some separation for costume,
props, and make-up facilities
(most of this occurs in one room

at present).
*a “green room’’ or actor’s
lounge.

*classrooms for design, direc-
ting, etc. (classes are presently
taught in the Troubadour lob-
by...)

The emphasis in this plan is
not a huge building, but one of
many uses. Above all, a

teaching place. Gordon and
university officials are en-
couraged by the Board’s
positive response to the pro-
gram’s needs. Until site
research is complete, no
designs or fund-drives will oc-
cur, but for the first time, the
spirit is one of optimism and
hopefulness at the University
Theatre.

Cavalier Daily Goes Independent

CHARLOTTESVILLE - The
editors of the University of
Virginia’s student newspaper,
the Cavalier Daily, have decid-
ed to operate this year without
any university funds so that
they can receive salaries.

The decision comes after an
administrative committee rul-
ed last spring that editors of the
newspaper would not receive
salaries.

Usually the Cavalier Daily, or
CD, receives about $30,000 of its
$200,000 annual operating
budget from the student activi-
ty fund. Such financial support
gave the student activites com-
mittee, headed by an associate
dean of students, the right to
rule against editors’ salaries.

Chi Psi’s Dilemma

Chi Psi is W&L’s newest
fraternal organization. Found-
ed in 1977, this colony has sear-
ched out several locations in its
desire for a house.

After several refusals, a solu-
tion seemingly appeared as Chi
Psi (through the university)
began to negotiote for the rental
of the deserted Ann Smith
school, across from the post of-
fice. But just as the final plans
became certain, the Chi Psi’s
have found themselves blocked
from immediate occupancy.

Even after city council ap-
proval of the Washington and
Lee purchase bid of $130,000
(theirs was the only bid), the ci-
ty attorney has been unable to
declare Chi Psi’s occupancy an
acceptable use of the land.

Fraternities, at this point, are
not yet covered sufficiently on
the city’s newest zoning or-
dinances. Some question re-
mains on whether the fraternity
can lease commercially-zoned
property.

In tracing the records, it can
be seen that no fraternity has
bought or leased any new pro-
perty for some 15-20 years. The
city zoning ordinances were
drawn up after that time, and
made no provision for future
fraternity expansion.

The final decision will remain
unclear until a special hearing
of the City Planning
Commission—scheduled for
Monday, September 25 at 5

p.m.—can meet on the matter.
Its recommendation will go
directly to the Lexington City
Council, where the matter will
reach a final vote in early Oc-
tober.

At the August 10 meeting of
the City Council, the body ap-
proved W&L’s $130,000 bid by a
majority of 4-2. If the City Plan-
ning Commission report is
favorable, the Council may
very well repeat its earlier vote
(Ben Lewis and Taylor Woody
dissenting). The two opponents
felt that the property and land
were in the $175,000-range,
regardless of the fact that W&L
offered the sole bid.

The primary opponent to Chi
Psi’s occupation of the site is St.
Patrick’s Catholic Church. At
the August 10 meeting, Father
Francis Sullivan expressed his
concern over traffic, conges-
tion, and parking problems.
Also, the church holds a Satur-
day afternoon Vigil mass which
he feared would be exposed to
undue noise from Chi Psi.

A retired officer, Col. Philbin,
is the only other neighbor in
close residence. Philbin,
located next door to the Post Of-
fice in the old KA house, spoke
in favor of Chi Psi at the August
10 meeting.

In the meantime, Chi Psi has
rented a series of suites in the
Woods Creek Apartments,
where they will conduct all rush
activities.

Theatre season sports new look

This year’s playbill from the
University Theatre is a bit of a
departure. Unlike previous
seasons which have featured six
or seven major, full length pro-
ductions, this season will see
three major shows mixed in
with four evenings of ex-
perimental theatre.

Major shows will be
presented once each term with
Al Gordon directing Ibsen’s A

Doll’s House and Shaw’s Can-

dida on alternate nights in the
weeks just before Thanksgiving
break. These two marriage

dramas will be performed on
the same Victorian set in the
Boiler Toom in the basement of
Old Main Street. Gordon had

taken on this project to provide
a chance to compare and con-
trast two plays written on

similar themes.

€ nletuinmment
Musical Mainstream

For the average music fan,
summer is a time to sit back
and wait for the inevitable flood
of fall album releases and tours.
Significant new LPs are few
and far between, and the con-
cert scene slows down to a few
major outdoor shows in and
around large cities.

Something happened in the
summer of ’78, though. It was
too much to hope for, but the
Rolling Stones and the Who
slammed back with fine albums
(about which more in future
weeks) after several years in
the doldrums. The Moody Blues
got back together for a reunion
LP and possible tour. Punk rock

sank further into the grave, °

while a few top-notch “new
wave” groups (most notably
the Tom Robinson Band)
released records which are
among the best of the year so
far. And in the “three years
later’’ department, Bruce Spr-
ingsteen’s longawaited follow-
up to “Born To Run” finally hit
the streets, backed by what is
from all accounts a dynamite
concert tour (see below).

Of course, the big news in
rock and roll this summer was
the Rolling Stones’ American
tour-their first here in three
years. Faithful readers of this
column will remember that last
year at this time, I reviewed the
latest Stones live album, “‘Love
You Live.’’ The write-up was a
generally unfavorable one, and
concluded that the magic of a
Rolling Stones concert just
didn’t come through on vinyl--
perhaps you just “had to be
there.”’

Well, this summer I was
there, and the Stones didn’t
come through on dn’t cut it in
person either. Along with
100,000 other people, I saw the
band on June 17 at JFK Stadium
in Philadelphia. According to
most reports, it was one of the
tour’s weakest shows, but cer-
tainly not the only poor one. The
band was half-hearted and just
plain sloppy—Jagger and
Richard weren’t even getting
back to the mikes in time for the
choruses to some of the songs.
Of course, maybe you'd be tired
too if you’d been singing
‘Satisfaction’ for over a
decade. An album as good as
Some Girls deserved a first-rate
tour to back it up, but it seemed
in many cities this summer that
the Rolling Stones just couldn’t
get it up anymore.

‘i — . . = : Bien’

Bruce Springsteen

Bruce Springsteen began his
bid to reclaim the future of
rock’n’roll early this summer
with a tour that could only be
described as gargantuan, in-
volving over 80 shows in 70
cities. Bruce first took the stage
in Buffalo on May 23rd, a few
days before the release of his
long-awaited fourth album,
“Darkness on the Edge of
Town”.

Despite the fact that the
somewhat localized nature of
Springsteen’s popularity tends
to undermine the validity of any
generalizations on the national
level, it was generally conclud-
ed among rock’s critical es-
tablishment that the Springs-
teen tour was the big event of
the summer, equaling the
Stones in volume and far sur-
passing them in quality.

As unusual as it may seem,
the consistent excellence of the
shows was probably the most
surpirsing aspect of the tour,
especially among people who
have followed Bruce since the
release of his first album nearly
6 yeats an6, VEU
‘“Darkness...’’ appeared on the
scene, the single overriding
theme projected from every
Springsteen album and every
Springsteen concert was one of
joyful triumph.

Then came ‘“‘Darkness on the
Edge of Town,’’ whose key
song, ‘‘Racing in the Streets,’
portrayed the author as an in-

by Mark Mainwaring
and Robin- Meredith

dividual trapped in a vicious
circle of sin and rebirth which
could never be truly conquered.
Put simply, the joy was gone,
and much of the thrill along
with it.

The end result of all this
reflection was a slight tinge of
apprehension shared among
mnay Springsteen fans as they
flocked to the concert halls this
summer. Would the joyful
celebrations of youth we had all
lived for be gone, replaced by
bitterly mature, ritualistic
preoccupations with sin and
heritage?

Well, Bruce made all of our
musings and doubts seem
rather ridiculous, as he pro-
ceeded to put on one of the fun-
niest and most emotionally
moving shows I have witnessed.
He managed to create a tension
out of the thematic contrasts
between new and old material
and use it with overwhelming
success. If “the future’’ was
ever truly within his reach, now
is definitely the time.

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES

On the local concert scene,
Bob Segar will be appearing at
the Roanoke Civic Center on
Sept. 27, along with special
guests Toby Beau. The Doobie
Brothers and UFO will also be
appearing at the Civic Center
on Oct. 5.

The winter term production,
yet to be chosen by Lee Kahn,
will likely be another tradi-
tional theatrical undertaking,
not unlike usual Troubador
fare. The final major work of
the year will be done by Tom
Ziegler and the total theatre
class, possibly combining live
acting and film in some way.

Particularly noteworthy,
though, are the four experimen-
tal productions scheduled two
each in the fall and winter
terms. These experimental pro-
ductions scheduled two each in
the fall and winter terms ex-
perimental productions will
take the place of the senior
thesis shows of past seasons.

According to Al Gordon, the
full scale presentations re-
quired of majors in the past
“tended to turn the director into
a producer.’’ The pressures of
logistics undermined the ability
to concentrate on_ the
creative/artistic aspect of the
experience.

As well as a single large pro-
ject encouraged ‘“‘tunnel vi-
sion.’ Acting students acted,
directing students directed and
exposure to outside areas was
rare. The new arrangement
calls for each major to work on
at least two experimentals and
work on several aspects of
various productions.

Gordon suggests that the new
set-up will provide “more ar-
tistic control and depth.

- Smaller, more managable pro-

jects ‘“‘will allow more ex-
perimentation and will allow
majors to get away from safe
shows’? by avoiding the
pressures of a large one shot
project.

Those most affected by the
shift, the senior majors, seem
pleased with the idea. Hunt
Brown says that, ‘‘It is for the
better.’’ Echoing his sen-
timents, John Jacobsen says, “‘I
think it will encourage serious
work.”’

Openness is the key to this
new approach. Gordon em-
phasizes that faculty participa-
tion in any phase of the ex-
perimental process is welcom-
ed. Any ideas should be directed
toward him. :

Finally, the plans call for
each experimental to be follow-
ed by instant critique by the au-
dience, another wrinkle design-
ed to open the flow of ideas.

In all, the 1978-79 theatre
season at W&L promises to be
different, daring, thought pro-
voking, a tremendous learning
experience for all involved, in a
word, fun.

Summer Spawns Films

by Dick Barron

Summertime is over but the
movies linger on. This was a
great season for the flicks.
There were some fireworks on
the screen and there were some
bombs. Of the many interesting
releases there are three which
immediately come to mind.
Grease, The Eyes of Laura
Mars, and Heaven Can Wait,
are all indicative of the new
climate in the movie industry.

There seems to be a return to
the romantic, entertaining, and
stylized moviemaking of the old
days at the major film fac-
tories. Realism and social com-
ment are taking a back seat to
the thrills, color and showman-
ship that made Hollywood
great.

The film on everyone’s mind
this summer was Grease,
directed by and starring those
Doublemint kids John Travolta
and Olivia Newton-John. Right
off the bat one wonders how
Disco-King Travolta and Olivia
‘“‘Have You Never Been
Mellow’ Newton-John could
make a successful pair.

The combination works
because Newton-John and
Travolta are equally shallow in
their roles as the wholesome
cheerleader and the nice-guy
hood. There are no academy
award winning performances
here, but the movie is flashy
enough to make up for its faults.

Mucially, the pop-disco title
track somehow seems out of
place with the fifties motif.
Travolta’s singing,while it may
lack real agility, has enough
spirit to remain pleasant (a
rock’n roller he ain’t). Newton-
John has long been a pop
favorite, and neither her fars
nor her critics will see any dif-
ference between this and past
efforts. (I heartily approve of
her skin-tight pants.)

Let’s face it, with a strong
supporting cast, some clever
surprises, and a dose of
schmaltz, Grease brings us
back to the movie house for a
mindless escape. So, like Lava
Lites and Billy Beer, Grease
has its place in the limbo of the
useless excell - a place where
things go when they’re not real-
ly good enough to be practical,
and they’re not really bad
enough to be trash.

The Eyes of Laura Mars gives
a sharp contrast to the fluff of
Grease. Starring Tommy-Lee

Jones and Faye Dunaway, Eyes
is a thriller in the Hitchcock
vein. This film gives one a
welcomed relief from lonely
haunted houses and _ horribly
posssessed children.

In Eyes it’s people against
people, doing some pretty horri-
ble things to each other in the
Big Apple. Laura Mars is a
fashion photographer whose
eerie, sexy photos are seen
everywhere from buses to art
galleries. But Laura is having a
problem.

At a most unexpected time
Laura gets a vision of one of her
friends being stalked by a
killer-through the killer’s eyes.
Needless to say our heroine is
rather disturbed as _ she
helplessly watches friend after
friend being stalked and killed,
eventually seeing herself as a
potential victim.

To detail the many twists of
plot would be like explaining the
road to Sweetbriar — you’ve got
to experience it. Excellent
direction and classy opening
titles create the mood for icy
suspense (take a date to this one
and she’ll hold on for dear life).
Overall, Eyes is a chilling treat
for summertime or schooltime.

Heaven Can Wait—directed
by, co-written by, and starring
Warren Beatty is without a
doubt the most consistent and
rewarding of this trio of films.
Beatty has clearly
demonstrated his gift for
creating the type of subtle
romantic comedy which
flourished in the thirties and
forties. A remake of an earlier
film ‘‘Here Comes Mr. Jordan

(1941),’’ Heaven Can Wait is a
somewhat confusing story of a
football quarterback who meets
an early grave.

Unfortunately the represen-
tative from Heaven (Buck
Henry) is a qualified incompe-
tent who snaps Beatty from the
world of the living before his
time is up. Complications
abound when the self of the
quarterback is sent back into
the body of a multimillionaire.

The heart of all this madness
is the millionaire’s romance
with a young activist (Julie
Christie). Beatty and Christie
light up the screen with a pierc-
ing eye contact which hasn’t
been seen since Rhett Butler
swept Scarlett O’Hara off her
feet. Relax, Clark Gable fans,
Heaven Can Wait is by no

means another Gone With The’

Wind, but its romantic content
rates with the greats. Combine
this romance with some fine
supporting actors (Dyan Can-
non shines) and a lively score
and you have possibly this
year’s best movie entertain-
ment. Watch the Academy
Awards for this one.

There it is, a small selection
of thiS season’s offerings. I’ve
selected this group because
they all have a quality of fan-
tasy which is giving new life toa
once troubled industry. These
films, along with earlier hits
such as Star Wars and Close En-
counters, demonstrate that im-
aginative and open ended film-
making allows the viewer to en-
joy and experience movies in a
more satisfying way than hard
edged realism could allow.

Eye And Ear:
From The Bookstore

KK KKK

These last few days have
made it clear that the anatomy
of the Co-op Building is a
mystery to upperclassmen as
well as newly-arrived
freshmen. So many levels, so
many nooks and crannies, so
many functions! As one who
spends most of her waking
hours there, I can perhaps,
dissect the building so that
when spring arrives we won't
find some gaunt soul still trying
to exchange his first issue of
linen.

Administratively, there are
two sections in the building: the
Supply Store and the Bookstore.
The Supply Store handles mer-
chandise (behind the glass
doors, top level), the Snack Bar
(also top level) and the Linen
Service (third level down,
behind the textbooks). The
Bookstore includes a general
book department (second level
down, but first level if you enter
from the freshman door side -
O.K.?) the textbook department
(one level down from there) and
a record shop (fourth level from
the top.)

Granted that the Co-op has a
rabbit-warren pattern about it,
there are areas of grace and
pleasure as well as mystery
here. The Bookstore, with
which I am most familiar, of-
fers in the walnut-paneled,
carpeted area an opportunity
for exploration among about
4,000 different books. Here you
buy books you want, not those
you must. We carry books rang-
ing from cooking to philosophy,
art to travel, and from science
to humor.

All members of the W&L
‘community-and this includes
students who are, after all, the
reason for the University’s ex-
istence, have automatic charge
accounts here. Special orders
for books we do not carry
(there are a few) - are prompt-
ly and precisely processed. We
handle hundreds of such orders
each year and are truly proud of
the service we give.

There are no pressures in the
Bookstore. You are not going to
be graded there or called on to
recite. But it is a lively place

*
*

KKK KK

with plenty of conversation,
discussion, even arguments as
weil as lots of nonsense and

laughter.

By now the students have
found the textbook section of the
Bookstore, -and found it all too
expensive, I suspect, too. There
were some changes, and shor-
tages - supplying textbooks has
a lot in common with Russian
Roulette, but it will all settle out
with out too much agony, we
hope.

Students may charge text-

‘books only if we have authoriza-

tion from his parents. Too,
TAKE NOTE, that books may
be returned only until Oct. ist
and if they are in mint condi-
tion.

Record Store

You have a record store all
your own, stocked to suit your
needs and priced to fit easily
within your budget. The
Washington and Lee University
Record Store is located beneath
the Bookstore in the Coop base-
ment. Since the store is limited
in space we may not carry
every record you want, so
please, if you have any
preferences or special orders
ask the store manager, Dan
Scott, tostock what you want.

We do, however, carry all
sorts of recordings—classical
music from the medieval period
through the 20th century, vin-
tage jazz and blues, ECM jazz,
ragtime, folk, ethnic folk, coun-
try, bluegrass, old time, topical
records, cut-outs, and a wide
variety of pop and rock LP’s.

Records arrive nearly every
day so check the store often to
see what is new. Aside from
music, we carry a complete line
of tapes and record case pro-
ducts at very affordable prices.

The philosophy of the store is,
to carry as wide a variety in
recorded sound as_ possible
while still stocking records that
are popular and well known. So
whether you intend to expand
your record collection or ex-
pand your musical knoweldge,
the W&L record Store is open 8
to 4 weekdays to serve you.

WLUR Returns
Equipment Added

Washington and Lee’s student
operated radio station, WLUR,
will return to the airwaves next
Tuesday morning, the station’s
music director, Mark Mainwar-
ing, has announced.

Located at 91.5 on the FM
dial, WLUR operates as a non-
commerical station, primarily
as an alternative to formats
which can be heard in the area.

Mainwaring said he an-
ticipated few changes from the
format which the station
adopted last spring. The format
includes music for a variety of
tastes, including popular rock,
classical, jazz, and the in-
novative ‘‘Third Ear.”’

One new addition to the sta-
tion, he said, is a _ portable
transmitter which is now on
order. ‘‘This will allow us to do
remote broadcasts from almost
anywhere, without the limita-
tions we’ve had in the past. It
opens up a whole new world for
us—from man in the street in-
terviews to live remote broad-
casts,”’ he said.

The portable transmitter will
be particularly helpful in ad-
ding a new dimension to the sta-
tion’s news department, said
news director Charlie Smith.

 

 

Smith said that the station
planned more “‘spot’’ news in
the form of newscasts of either
five minutes or fifteen minutes
throughout the day.

“Our main objective is to
keep the student informed: it is
amazing to me how few
students really know what’s go-
ing on in the outside world. And
there aren’t a lot of students
who read more than the comics
and sports pages of the

newspaper.”

Smith also said the portable
transmitter would be used to ex-
pand the station’s local
coverage of events, such as stu-
dent government meetings and

Lexington government
meetings.
“In this way, we hope

students can become more in-
formed and participate in-
telligently in the activities of
not only their school, but also
the community which sur-
rounds it,”’ Smith said.

Any interested persons who
would like to help with the sta-
tion, in any phase of its opera-
tion, are encouraged to stop by
the studio. Positions are open to
all.

 

SAB Considers Weeknight Party Ban

The Student Activities Board
(SAB) held its first meeting of
the year Sunday October 10.
Although no business was tran-
sacted, (at this ‘get ac-
quainted”’ meeting) several im-
portant issues were discussed.

A “favorable consensus’ was
given to a proposal made by
Brick Brown of a party at the
Pavillion on the weekend of Oc-
tober 7. Brown’s proposal calls
for the Student Bar Association

to hire a country rock band. The
Executive Committee is to sup-
ply the beer and the SAB the
manpower.

Other discussions call for a
budgeting of about $4000 for
Homecoming. Entertainment is
expected to consist of a mix of
rock and soul.

Because there is no budget as
yet, there have been no plans
made for entertainment in the

Cockpit. Plans will be made as
the budget is drawn up.

Finally, there was some
discussion of Fancy Dress. Last
year there was much talk of
rescheduling Fancy Dress dur-
ing the Washington Holiday to
avoid a conflict between Fancy
Dress and academic work. A
possible promise solution, call-
ing for the banning of Universi-
ty sponsored parties on
weeknights was ‘‘considered.”’

The Ring-tum Phi, Sept. 14,1978 Page9

Sigma Chi president arrested for violation

of Lexington noise ordinance

cont. from p. 1

pointed out that there were par-
ties going on at every other
fraternity on campus Saturday
night with music ‘‘just as loud
as ours,”’

He also said that he went out-
side of the house to check how
loud the music was and thought
that he had ‘“‘accomodated the
ordinance.” Brooks added that
the noise level could not have
disturbed neighbors because
the houses surrounding Sigma
Chi are occupied by students.

Purvis used discretion

Officer Purvis said there had
been no specific complaint, but
that he had been using his
discretion by arresting Brooks.

Sigma Chi’s noise Saturday
could be heard ‘from the
University Cleaners,’ Purvis
said, and was louder than that
coming from the Red Square
fraternities. He said the noise at
those houses could only be
heard as you ‘‘came before the
house.”’

Judge Hess questioned why
Brooks had been arrested on the
second incident Saturday night
and not just issued a summons.
Purvis pointed out that Brooks
had been warned twice and
served with a summons the
previous Tuesday.

The officer also said that he
had been instructed by Police
Chief Kirby that fraternities
were no longer to be warned,
but to be charged so that the or-
dinance would be adhered to.
Purvis noted that the $50 bond
set for Brooks was waved and
the fraternity president was

released on_ personal
recognizance.
In his verdict, Judge Hess fin-

ed Brooks $10 plus court costs
for the first offense and dismiss-
ed the charges levied for the
Saturday night party and arrest
“because of other matters not
being done and the need for
things to be worked out fairly.”

Hess instructed Purvis and
other Lexington police officers
to use their ‘‘experience and
discretion” in deciding whether
to issue a summons or an arrest
warrant for future violations of
the city’s noise ordinance.

Arrest ‘“‘unnecessary”’

In an interview with the
Ring-tum Phi after the trial,
Brooks called his arrest ‘‘un-
necessary.”

‘Purvis’ threats to impound
our sound system were over-
done, and I did not appreciate
his lecture on the evils of col-
lege students,” Brooks said.
“My main concern at the time
was that it was hurting our
Rush,” he added.

“T haven’t the vaguest con-
ception why Purvis would be
against us, if he is,’’ Brooks
said.

Brooks found Judge Hess
“fair and cooperative and
understanding of the situation.
He thought it was unnecessary
for Purvis to arrest me.”

IFC action

The Interfraternity Council
(IFC) jumped into action on the
incident Tuesday night.

Beau Dudley, president of the
student body, spoke before the
assembled group of fraternity
presidents and representatives
and said, “(Police Chief) Kirby
has told his policemen that
there will be no more warn-
ings’’ on noise violations.

“Unless we are willing to
make some concessions to the
town, they will not alter their
policy,” Dudley said. ‘Either
we bite the bullet or our actions
will just be an exercise in futili-

ty.”

Weeknight parties are the
problem”

Dudley suggested a conces-
sion on weeknight parties by
picking only one night of the
week to party and ending the

Getting Your Car
Towed In Lexington

For those of you who will be
unfortunate enough this next
year to have your car towed
away, here is some information
that may prove to be helpful:

If your car is towed away in
the City of Lexington Monday
through Friday between the
hours of 8:30 - 4:30 you can pick
up your car at the city garage.
This is located behind the SPCA
on Campbell Lane, also refer-
red to as “Shop Road.”’ But you
first must go and pay your
ticket at the police station
before going to pick up your car
at the city garage.

However, if you don’t get in to
pick up your car on weekdays
until after 4:30 you must pick it
up that following day. This in-
cludes Fridays—in that case,
you will have to wait until the
following Monday.

You may be lucky enough to
have your car towed away after
business hours (4:30). In that
case your car will be towed to
the police ‘station. You will be
able to pick it up there any time

of the day after regular

business hours.

Now that you have had the
misfortune of having your car
towed away, it will cost at least
$17 to get it on the streets again.
There will be an extra addi-
tional $5 ticket that must be
paid if your car was parked ina
restriced area. This could bring
your whole total to $22 if you
want to reclaim your car from
the city of Lexington.

However, beware if your car
is towed away by Rockbridge

revelry earlier.

“Weeknight parties are the
problem,’’ he said. ‘The town
does not have as much of a pro-
blem with the weekends.’
Dudley also suggested that the
music at parties be turned
down. He_- emphasized,
however, that the fraternities
must ‘work together as a
group.”

In return for partying earlier
and just on one night during the
week, Dudley hopes to receive
the following:
~-no police action taken without
a complaint being registered.

(‘The idea of Purvis taking
his pick of the fraternity houses

when nobody on God’s green
earth is bothered by the music
is wrong,” Dudley said.)

—police to give at least one war-
ning.

—discontinue the enforcement
of the noise ordinance during
the daylight hours.

(Section 15-33 of the city code
states generally that “except in
public emergency” it is
unlawful to use ‘‘sound-
amplifying equipment or
loudspeakers in such a manner
that the sound or noise is audi-
ble to the public.’’)

-wave the noise ordinance for
three weekends a year.

Ring-tum Phi Interview

 

Dudley cautioned that they’ve
got the law, it’s on the books,
and the cards are in their
hands.”’

Dean Dan Murphy, fraternity
advisor, added that the frater-
nities are ‘‘in a no-win situation
now.”

‘What I want is something
concrete to show him (Kirby),”’
Dudley said, ‘“‘to get honest
negotiations going.”’

IFC representatives will meet
again tonight to formulate a
compromise for the city.

WLUR News Director Charlie
Smith contributed to this story.

William Hartog: The New
Admissions Director Is Working

To Make W&L More Attractive

William M. Hartog, W&L’s
new Director of Admissions,
said that his first impression of
W&L was the great amount of
enthusiasm everyone had for
the school. He adds that he
“hasn’t been disappointed”
since that first impression.

He is also pleased with the
openness of students and facul-
ty in making suggestions. Even
though Hartog has a firm grasp
of admissions problems, he
claims he only knows ‘10%
about W&L”’ and that it will
take ‘‘at least a year to learn
the other 90%.”’

Hartog further said that he
did not intend to make any
sweeping changes soon. His
first assurance was that ‘‘we
won’t turn our backs on the
past.” He intends to continue
the developing of bases at
schools that have traditionally
supported W&L.

The enthusiasm that Hartog
has noticed is matched by his
own in tackling the problems of
admissions. He intends to
develop new areas of support,
and has organized an ambitious
travelling schedule. Both he
and his staff will spend a total of
30 weeks on the road from Sept.
17 to Dec. 10.

His ambitious traveling
schedule is an outgrowth of his
view of the role of directors of
admissions. He looks upon them
as being “facilitators,” making
it as easy as possible for the stu-

dent to find out about a school.

He said that W&L doesn’t
have “incredible weight”’ in the
initial stages of contact. For
this reason, it must be made as
easy as possible for the prospec-
tive student to learn of W&L. He
feels that prospective students
must be saturated with
literature.

Hartog also said that W&L
has two demographic
characteristics that usually
hurt an admissions program,
but at W&L he considers them
to be assets. Being a single sex
school in a rural area should be
presented as the strengths of
W&L, and not characteristics to
be apologized for.

The main problem, according
to Hartog, is the prospective
student not visiting W&L. He
feels that meeting the students,
faculty, and administration is
the best way to acquaint the stu-
dent with the strengths of W&L.
He intends to set up a program
for visiting students to stay
overnight in the freshman
dorms.

Hartog is familiar with ad-
missions policies. He was ap-
pointed Director of Admissions
at Rollins College in Florida at
24, but originally had no inten-
tion of entering the admissions
field.

He said he was a combined
history and business major
“simply because I didn’t know
what I was going to do.”’

He went on to receive his
master’s degree in business,
and them taught at his
preporatory school in New York
for a year. He knew he wanted
to work with students and
counsel them, and he con-
sidered teaching an extension of
this interest.

Soon, he was offered the job of
Assistant Director of Admis-
sions, and hoped to eventually
work in student guidance. In-
stead, he was appointed Direc-
tor of Admissions.

He said that the only way his
youth was a liability was in
other people knowing of his lack
of experience. He said that he
“felt conscious of his age, but
had no inferiority complex
about it.” Hartog, now 31, said
that becoming the Director of
Admissions was ‘“‘the best thing
that ever happened to me.”’

Hartog was happy at Rollins,
and W&L was the only other
place he applied for a job. He
heard about the job by word of
mouth, and felt he needed a pro-
fessional change. The president
of the college that appointed
him resigned, Hartog explain-
ed, so he felt no personal
allegiance to any individual.

His staff had also met all the
goals they had set, so Hartog
felt ready for a new challenge.
Although he was not familiar
with W&L before learning of the
job, he has quickly grown to like
it.

Natural Bridge 1978:

Student Body President Speaks

The annual freshman pilgrimage to Natural Bridge occurred last
Thursday, September 7. A highlight of the overnight trip was the
address by the President of the Student Body. This is one of the first
official duties of the year for new president Beau Dudley, and
represents a most promising start. Rather than a general news
story, we believe that this section gives the essential flavor of the
‘‘Natural Bridge experience.’’ And above all, this should serve as
an introduction to Mr. Dudley, whose name will appear in these
pages time and again.

I’m Beau Dudley, and in one of its weaker moments the Student
Body elected me to serve as President for the coming year. I’m
awfully excited about the year ahead, and I suppose one of the main
points I’s like to make tonight is that I think you all should also be
excited.

“I urge you to take advantage of this wonderful school,

to work for her, and to enjoy her.”

    

Frank Parsons, Betty Munger and others register looks of amusement and/or shock when confronted

with Natural Bridge cuisine.

I remember quite well my own feelings when I came to
Washington and Lee as a freshman in 1970. Before you think that it
has taken me8 years to become a senior, let me point out that I’ma
3rd year law student here. That’s not overly important, but it may
help me illustrate a point to say that my feelings in 1970 were
perhaps 80% fear of wnat lay ahead, and maybe 20% eager an-
ticipation and excitement. On reflection I’m fairly sure that those
figures were just about backwards. It seems to me that you all
should be looking very forward to the next four years, with perhaps
a little bit of nervous anxiety mixed in.

Make no mistake about it, the challenges you will face here will
be demanding ones, both in and out of the classroom. But as I’m
sure you've already heard from your guidance counselors and your
parents, the fact of your admission here is testimony that you can
do the work if you apply yourselves. And I want to assure you that
the benefits of meeting all of the challenges ahead will be almost
immeasurable.

Before I go any further I think I’d better apologize for sounding
like a father, an alumni director, and a preacher during the next
few minutes, but it did occur to me that perhaps I had a few pieces
of advice which I believe are worth keeping in mind as you con-
template your years at Washington and Lee.

 

The first thought I have is that we all should realize how fortunate
we are to have arrived at this point in our lives with the chance to
spend time at W&L having grown from a possibility into a certain-
ty. It probably goes without saying that many others would give
quite a bit to be in our shoes, and to have that same lucky set of cir-
cumstances facing them. I want to suggest to you that being a
freshman at W&L is -»ne of thousands of other positions you could
find yourself in, very few of which would be as appealing and poten-
tially rewarding as the one you're in.

Second, I think that you will benefit from realizing the tremen-
dous opportunity that you have been given by coming to W&L. The
opportunities for participation, contribution, and success presented
at a school of our size and caliber are literally too numerous to men-
tion. If we realize the existence of these opportunities, it seems to
me logical that we should take advantage of them, so that at the end
of our stay here we can experience the great satisfaction that will
come from doing so. More on that a bit later.

It is also my strong belief that we all ought to keep in mind that,
in addition to our own efforts, there are others who deserve our
credit and thanks for the support which has made it possible for us
to be at Washington and Lee. Whether it be our parents, our friends,
or a scholarship fund, it occurs to me that we can all benefit from
keeping in mind that perhaps we owe to those people and to
ourselves a duty to give it our best effort, in order that those who

~ have helped us get to W&L will be rewarded and reinforced through

those efforts.

_ You may well be wondering whether the hard work will be worth : ii
it to you in the long run. There’s a great deal of talk these days
about the value of a liberal arts education, and about who’s getting
what kind of jobs, etc. With the advance approval of several
members of the Executive Committee (who will be held totally
responsible if this is a flop), I’m going to risk telling you a joke
which may be of some relevance in this area. At any rate it’s time
that you were introduced to one of the rivalries which enlivens our
athletic and social atmosphere here.

The story takes place a number of years in the future, at a time
when medical science has progressed to the point where brain
transplants are possible. An enterprising young man who had not
been fortunate enough to attend college approached a well-known
doctor about the possibility of getting a college-educated mind by
transplant. The doctor replied that this would be quite feasible, but
that the doctor would need a little bit more help on exactly the type
of college mind the young man wanted.

“You see,” said the doctor, ‘‘the price goes up depending on the
college you choose. If, for instance, you want a Madison brain it will
cost you five dollars a pound. A Randolph-Macon brain will be
seven fifty a pound, a Hampden-Sydney brain will be about ten

came here in 1970. I believe strongly that you will feel the same
way, beginning here tonight with freshman orientation.

I would like to leave you with one final piece of unsolicited advice
before I quit. I think you ought to really take advantage of
Washington and Lee. Take her for a ride. As a metter of fact I think
you ought to take her for everything she’s worth. Of course I don’t ’
mean that in the sense of milking W&L and putting back nothing in
return, nor do I mean that you ought to slide by with as little effort
as possible and have the last laugh as you leave (and I doubt that
attitude is prevalent among you anyway). But I do think one of the
best ways to enjoy your experience here will come from simply get-
ting involved, from singling out one or more activities and then
making every effort to excell in them. Whether that turns out to be
athletics or drama or publications, whether it will be in fraternity
life, intramurals or most importantly academics, I believe that the

Soccer Team Goes 1-2
In Pre-Season Play

The W&L soccer Generals,
competing for the first time in
the Washington College pre-
season tournament last
weekend, finished third with a
1-2 record. The tournament was
considered a pre-season exhibi-
tion for W&L and will not count
in their overall won-loss record.

The Generals won their first
game 2-1 over Western
Maryland as goals by seniors
Howie Collier (on a penalty
kick) and Todd Tyson provided
the margin of victory. W&L was
defeated 3-0 by host Washington
College as the back to back 180
minutes of soccer proved too
much for W&L’s traveling con-
tingent of 14 players. The
Generals lost to Drexel 2-1 in
their final game on Saturday as
Collier again scored for . W&L.
Sophomore Kevin Carney
played all three games in goal.

Coach Rolf Piranian praised
his team for their effort, saying
“T’m proud of my players
because they hung in there
under adverse conditions with
very little rest and little
substitution. Considering those
factors, they did an excellent
job.”

The Generals open their
regular season this Saturday
with a game against the Garnet
of Swarthmore at 2:00 p.m. in
Swarthmore, Pa. Swarthmore

defeated Navy last year and
Piranian expects them to be one
of his team’s most difficult Divi-
sion III opponents this year.

W&L is home for the first
time against the Valley United
Soccer Club of Roanoke on
September 23rd.

W&L Loses To Madison —
Faces Davidson Saturday

The Washington & Lee
Generals open the home portion
of their 1978 football season this
Saturday hosting Davidson Col-
lege of Davidson, N.C. The
kickoff is scheduled for 1:30
p.m. on W&L’s Wilson Field.
Last Saturday’s opener at
Madison proved to be unsuc-
cessful for the Generals as the
Dukes won 49-7.

Both Washington & Lee and
Davidson are looking for their
initial win of the new year. The
Wildcats suffered a somewhat
unexpected 30-14 loss to visiting
Fordham on Saturday. The
Rams rushed for 364 yards
against DC and stopped the
Cats three times within the 10
yard line in the second half. The
game also took its toll on the

Davidson lineup as starting
quarterback Bob McCarthy and
linebacker Barry Cannon were
lost for the season with injuries.

W&L coach Gary Fallon ex-
pects Davidson to present his
young team with their biggest
challenge of the 1978 season.
“The Wildcats are a physically
imposing team and will certain-
ly be gunning for that first win
on Saturday. My players
haven’t let me down yet and
have given it their all from
thefirst day of pre-season prac-
tice through the Madison game.

- That’s all I can ask for and hope

for the best against Davidson.”

The Generals opened the new
year losing 49-7 at James

Last Saturday’s Football game-
Did all go wrong for the Generals?

by Ray McNulty

The W&L Generals opened
their football season last Satur-
day on a less than impressive
note. They lost to James
Madison University by a score
of 49-7. Madison led by seven at
the half (14-7) and then totally
dominated the second half.

Despite being the underdog,
W&L played a strong first half.
The Generals moved the ball
well and the defense did a fairly
good job of halting Madison’s
attack. W&L had an opportunity
to score in the first half as
senior quarterback Scott Swope
directed the Generals towards
the goal line. Swope, who mixed
his running and passing game
will, still could not, get the ball
into the endzone.

W&L did score near the end of
the first half, but by that time
Madison already had a 14-point
lead. However, the W&L score
seemed to spark the Generals
as they went into the locker
room at halftime.

When the second half began,
it appeared that W&L would

have the momentum. If they
did, it didn’t last too long. It
took Madison only two minutes
to score on a 33-yard torichdown
run. This gave Madison a 14-
point lead and seemed to deflate
the Generals hopes. After that

Madison score it was all
downhill for W&L.
Madison completely

donimated the second half
outscoring W&L 35-0 and set a
Madison school record for first
downs in one game (32).

Several things hurt the
Generals against Madison. The
temperature on the field at
gametime was well over 90
degrees and the game was
played on astroturf. W&L prac-
tices on a grass field while
Madison practices on the turf.
This gave Madison a slight ad-
vantage.

Still, what hurt the Generals
the most was their failure to
establish a running game. The
Madison defense stopped the
W&L running attack and forced
the Generals to throw the ball.

Even star running back Stew
Atkinson could not help the
Generals as he carried the ball
12 times for only 17 yards.

Madison outrushed W&L 479
yards to 51 yards.

As the game went on Madison
looked better and better. It was
soon evident that Madison (a
Division II team) was by far the
superior team. W&L seemed too
inconsistant and appeared to
lack depth at several positions,
expecially in the offensive
backfield.

There were some bright spots
for W&L. Senior quarterback
Scott Swope connected on 16 of
31 passes for 150 yards and one
touchdown and was named
W&L’s offensive player of the
game. Senior flanker Rich
Wiles caught three passes for 61
yards, including a 10-yard
touchdown pass from Swope.
Sophomore slotback Chris
Leiser was W&L’s leading
receiver catching six passes for
62 yards. Leiser also carried the
ball three times for 16 yards.

On defense, senior linebacker
Carl Folcik and senior free safe-
ty Don Crossley led the
Generals conbining for a total of
26 tackles. Folick also had an in-
terception and Crossley was
named W&L’s defensive player
of the game.

Two W&L freshmen played
well against Madison and
should help the Generals this
year. Jim Palermo, a fullback
from Brentwood, N.Y., led the
Generals in rushing with 33
yards on 8 carries for an
average of-4.2 yards per carry.
Another freshman, Mike
Pressler is a_ starter at
noseguard on the W&L defense.
Pressler, from Wilton, Conn.,
made seven unassisted tackles
and played well.

W&L plays Davidson this
Saturday on Wilson Field at
1:30 p.m. Davidson defeated
W&L last year 42-14 at David-
son. The Wildcats should be
tough once again this year and
the Generals need everyone’s

support.

score indicated as W&L trailed
only 14-7 at the half after a
touchdown pass from senior
quarterback Scott Swope to
split end Rich Wiles with 0:35
remaining in the second
quarter. The W&L offense mov-
ed the ball fairly well through
the air against the Dukes as
Swope hit 15 0f 30 passes for 144
yards in being named the
Generals’ Offensive Player of
the Game.

JMU featured an eight man
defensive line in the game
which forced W&L to go to the
air a little more than originally
planned. Sophomore slotback
Chris Leiser caught six Swope
passes for 62 yards to lead the
W&L receiving corps. Because
of W&L’s success through the

- air, the Generals were limited

to 51 yards on the ground.

Does the rushing total worry
Fallon? ‘‘We’re not really con-
cerned about our rushing attack
as the game dictated we pass
the ball. Playing catch up foot-
ball and facing the wide tackle
six defense put a damper on our
running game.’ Freshman
fullback Jim Palermo led W&L
with 33 yards rushing including
one run for 23 yards. Tailback
Stewart Atkinson was keyed on
all day and finished with only 17
yards, leaving him 212 yards
short of W&L’s all-time career
rushing record.

The story of the game was
told in the Duke’s success
rushing the football as they
completed the day with 479
yards on the ground, including
29 first downs rushing (32 in
all). JMU threw only 11 times
and completed six for 75 yards.
W&L free safety Don Crossley
was called on to make 12 tackles
and two assists in being named
the Defensive Player of the
Game.

Linebackers Carl Folcik with
14 tackles and George Ballan-
tyne with nine also played well.
Freshman noseguard Mike
Pressler finished with 7 tackles
but had little support along the
defensive line. It was obvious
the heat of the afternoon (120
degrees on the Madison
astroturf) had an effect on the
Generals’ lack of depth. ‘‘Many
of our players had to go the
whole game in that heat, and as
the second half rolled on, it
eventually began to get to
them,” said Fallon. ‘JMU just
wore us down with their size,
speed, and depth. We gave it all
we had, it just wasn’t enough.”’

What does Fallon plan for
Davidson? “We're going to
make some changes this week
to help remedy our defense
against the rush. Overall, I was
pleased with our offensive ef-
fort on Saturday especially with
the play of center Bob
Burkholder and guard Scott
Smith. In the backfield, Swope
and Leiser played well. Our
linebackers did the job against
the Dukes and we’ll be looking
for that same effort from them
against Davidson. We have to
believe we can win as we
prepare for the upcoming
weekend.’’ Saturday is ‘‘Calen-
dar Day” for the Generals. The
first 500 spectators will receive
poster size schedule calendars.

Coach Lord, Bill Schneir

Win Honors Over Summer

Nroman Lord, well known
Phys. Ed. instructor, athletic
official and campus free lance
political commentator, was
given the 1978 Public Service
Award in July by the Virginia
High School Coaches Associa-
tion.

In receiving this award in
Richmond, Lord added another
honorable notch to his long thir-
ty plus year career at
Washington and Lee. Just a
year ago, Lord was presented
with the Walter Cormack
Memorial Award for his many
track and field contributions in
Virginia.

Lord has done much to
enliven his Physical Education
courses at W&L. For example,
the 1942 graduate of the Univer-
sity of Delaware skillfully
mixes business with pleasure
by requiring his handball
students to play their date in the
game. Not only does Lord for-
ment some student unrest by
putting young lovers against
each other in a “‘battle of the
sexes” but he has his fall
semester aerobics students em-
bark on a ‘Spook-Run’’ on
Halloween nights.

Outside of his collegiate
works, Lord has officiated and
promoted physical fitness
around Virginia for the last thir-
ty two years and presently
serves as the Commissioner of
Officials for the Valley (Va.)
Officials Association. Also, to
cap off his wide array of profes-
sional responsibilities, Lord
serves the American Army as a
sports consultant and toured
Europe this past summer con-
ducting athletic clinics for the
armed forces personnel station-
ed there.

Lord also speaks to interested
audiences on his political views,
which tend to veer to the right of
center. He combines zeal and
eloquence to conduct an effec-
tive ideological vendetta
against the liberal political
philosophy which he feels
permeates Washington, D.C.
Last spring, while speaking to a
sympathetic College
Republican audience, Coach
Lord figuratively presented the -
liberals with a large shovel with
which leftists could shovel their
political thinking. All in all, the
1978 Public Service Award
could not have gone to anyone
less colorful than Norman Lord.

 

Washington & Lee University

in 1976-77. The 1977 W&L soccer
guide -was also accorded top
honors.

In the area of special publica-
tions, a unique athletic depart-
ment catalog including in-

formation on all of the Universi-
ty’s sports offerings and
academic information, was
voted “Third Best in the Na-
tion.” The guide is used to help

Princeton. The 1977 W&L foot-
ball guide and 1977 cross coun-
try guide were recognized with
honorable mention citation.

The 24-year-old Schnier has
now received thirteen national
awards in his two years at

should continue to improve our
overall athletic administra-
tion.”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Bureaucratic Delay

And
Problems With Rome...

For at least a dozen years, the Ann Smith school
building at the corner of Lee and Nelson streets has
been one of the more familiar Lexington eyesores.
Though the grounds are kept in presentable condition,
the building itself suffers problems from broken win-
dows to damaged walls and floors. Washington and
Lee has often considered purchasing the building, but
no suitable use could be found. So the general feeling
of relief was understandable when the university sent
in a bid to buy the land, in order to rent the building to
Chi Psi Fraternity.

Chi Psi may be only one year old, but their plans are
impressive and commendable. Blessed with generous
financial support, they are in a position to handle all
interior renovation. And in addition, they agreed to
pay all property taxes on the building for the length of
their stay. Their enthusiasm spread to the Lexington
City Council; on August 10, that body agreed to the
plan. And then, the sudden bombshell. After a month
of delay, the city attorney suddenly found himself
unable to allow the move under present ordinances.
As a result, the City Council must vote again—not on
Chi Psi particularly, but regarding zoning allowances
for all future fraternity acquisitions.

In the forefront of the opposition has been the
neighboring Catholic church. Afraid of a parking pro-
blem, a 9-to-5 business might be more to their liking.
Also, noise during their Saturday mass was mention-
ed as a problem.

Somewhere along the line, though, this argument
strikes a false note. First, the local Catholic con-
gregation (minus those students who tend to walk to
mass) is rather small, even by Lexington standards.
In addition, the Catholic vigil mass occurs near the
fraternity dinner hour—a time that should be counted
upon for reasonable quiet.

We can appreciate the concern of the church coun-
cil, if they fear that the faithful (upon seeing one full
parking lot adjacent to the church) will shrug their
shoulders and keep driving, rather than find an alter-
nate parking spot. But it’s hard to believe that the
faith has slipped so far in this town.

In essence, a severe problem is rearing its head.
Fraternities are already being harassed by quiet-
loving residential neighbors who tie up police lines
every weekend. Chi Psi, on the other hand, has at-
tempted to move into a predominantly commercial
neighborhood. And yet they are encountering another
brand of resistance. The fraternity has no choice but
to hold up its plans for cleaning and restoration of the
building until the bureaucratic process has run its
course. ,

And who receives the biggest injustice of all? The
Ann Smith school, of course, which continues to fall in
on itself. One hopes that Chi Psi has enough resources
to fix the structure as originally planned, if the delays
ever end. The only other residential neighbor, on
Nelson Street went on record as being in favor of Chi
Psi’s plan; he called fraternity people ‘‘loving.” If the
laity can reach such a decision, it is our hope that the
church and city officials can find goodness in poten-
tial fraternity neighbors, too.

The City Planning Commission will meet
September 25 to make a decision, to guide the final Ci-
ty Council vote. It’s an open meeting; any interested
students can attend. The best of luck to Chi Psi and
their restoration plan; Lexington can always spare an

extra white elephant.

A Reluctant Farewell...

The chaos of returning to W&L for the fall is a
familiar yearly ritual, and it is strange to see a
farewell of any sort in this first issue. Unfortunately,
it’s here, and a sad one at that.

Of all the familiar faces on the hill, one of the front-
runners would have to be Shirley Floyd. For many of
you, hers was the first face you saw on campus — sit-
ting at her desk in the lobby of Washington Hall. Ad-
missions was her job (and devotion) ; she has schedul-
ed more tours and interviews than anyone is able to
recount.

Shirley was transferred to ‘‘front desk’’ about 212
years ago. At that time, a new and exciting group was
forming — The Student Recruitment Committee.
Within the past two years, its volunteer ranks have
grown four times over. And acting as co-ordinator
and housemother from the start was Mrs. Floyd.

As the committee members returned this week and
got the news of Shirley’s imminent departure, their
reactions of regret echoed all others who have had the
pleasure of knowing her. Said one senior member,
“She’s been with us from the start...how can she
leave? And who else can hold the volunteers
together?”’

Well, W&L has a knack of putting the right person
at the right job. But when you speak of Shirley Floyd
— that’s someone who had a direct input into the ap-
plication and admission of at least half the campus. A
tough act to follow...

All of us wish Shirley well in her new job, which
takes her back home to Texas. But yesterday, sur-
rounded by flowers on her last day, you just can’t help
feeling that we’re losing someone to which only this
place can really be ‘‘home.”’

DuPont Fund Gives $100,000
More To Washington and Lee

The Jessie Ball duPont
Religious, Charitable and
Educational Fund has given a
grant of $100,000 to Washington
and Lee University for
unrestricted endowment.

The fund was established in
Mrs. duPont’s will for the
philanthropic support of
charitable activities, notably in
higher education.

Mrs. duPont was a major
benefactor of Washington and
Lee during the last 30 years of
her life. In 1947 the university

awarded her the honorary Doc-
tor of Humane Letters degree,
and in 1959 she was elected to
the Washington and Lee Board
of Trustees. She remained a
board member until her death
Sept. 26, 1970. DuPont Hall on
the W&L campus, the fine arts
building, is named in her honor.

One of her principal interests
at Washington and Lee was in
establishing a large number of
individual scholarship and
student-loan funds for ‘‘promis-
ing and worthy students.”

A native of Northumberland
County, Va., she was married in
1921 to Alfred I. duPont. He died
in 1935.

Announcing the grant from
the Jessie Ball duPont Fund,
W&L President Robert E.R.
Huntley remarked: ‘‘Mrs. du-
Pont’s abiding interest in
Washingtpn and Lee for more
than three decades during her
lifetime strengthened this
university literally to an im-
measurable extent. In _par-
ticular, I have in mind the ex-
traordinary opportunities she
provided to hundreds upon hun-
dreds of young men whose at-
tendance here became possible
through her far-sighted philan-
thropy. I am proud to be able to
say that I was one of ‘her boys’
during my own student days at
Washington and Lee.”

“So it is particularly gratify-
ing, both on behalf of the univer-
sity and personally, to know
that the faith and confidence
Mrs. duPont demonstrated time
and time again in Washington
and Lee are continued in this
grant from the Jessie Ball du-
Pont Fund and that the singular
reach of her influence continues
to touch and sustain this univer-
sity.”’

A portrait of Mrs. duPont
hangs in Washington Hall, the
main building at Washington
and Lee. The painting was
unveiled in 1974 at Mount Ver-
non by her brother, Edward
Ball of Jacksonville, a trustee of
the Jessie Ball duPont Fund
created in her will.

Gifts Help Meet
Operating Expenses

The annual fund at
Washington and Lee University
raised $802,439 in unrestricted
gifts for operating expenses last
year, according to final figures
released by the university.

The record-high total reflects
an increase of almost 14 percent
over the previous year’s annual
fund total, $705,866, which itself
had set a record.

The size of the average gift
set another record at $142.22, up
from $135.74 a year ago, and
participation jumped to 36.6
percent of all W&L alumni from
the previous year’s 32.3 per-
cent.

W&L counts only gifts from

alumni and parents in its an-
nual fund figures, and only gifts
which are unrestricted and in-
tended to be spent for operating
expenses. Gifts to the universi-
ty’s permanent endowment,
together with all contributions
from friends and from business,
including Washington and Lee’s
share of gifts made through the
12-member Virginia Virginia
Foundation for Independent
Colleges, are not included in the
annual fund totals.

In 1977-78, the $802,439 paid 8.
percent of Washington and
Lee’s $10-million general
operating budget.

New Scholarship
Fund Announced

An endowed scholarship fund
has been established at
Washington and Lee University
in honor of a 1917 graduate of
the W&L law school, Robert
Hancock Jones.

The endowment’ was
established by his brother,
George Rather Jones, a 1937
B.A. graduate of W&L.

Both men live in Dallas.
Robert Hancock Jones, for
whom the scholarship fund is
named, is a retired attorney.

End Of Year Honors
Given To Students

Swimmer John S. Hudson
headed the list of award win-
ners as he was named the reci-
pient of the Preston R. Brown
Memorial Award at the season-
ending ‘All Sports Barbeque
and Award Ceremony” which
was last held May 23rd in the
Warner Athletic Center. The
Preston R. Brown Award is
given to Washington and Le®’s
Most Valuable Senior Athlete
for overall performance and
athletic proficiency during his
college career. It is voted on by
members of the athletic depart-
ment staff, and is considered
the highest honor a Washington
and Lee athlete may receive.

In four years, Hudson has
achieved All-American honors
seventeen different times. Head
coach Bill Stearns calls Hudson,
“By far and away, the best
swimmer in the University’s
history.”” Hudson was W&L’s
first ever national champion
winning the 500 and _ 1650
freestyle events as a
sophomore. He has been a state
of Virginia champion eight
times, is a school record holder

in six events, holds the state
record as a member of the W&L
800 free relay team, and has
been named W&L’s outstanding
swimmer in each of his four
years in Lexington.

Seniors Jeff Slatcoff and
Mark Duncan, both 1977 football
co-captains, were named co-
recipients of the Wink Glasgow
Spirit and Sportsmanship
Award. The Wink Glasgow
Award has been given annually

Since 1958 ‘‘to the W&L
senior(s) who has
demonstrated the _ highest

qualties of true W&L spirit and
sportsmanship in his career.”
This marked the first year that
there have been two winners.
Jim Herbert (Winston-Salem,
N.C.) was named the winner of
the Outstanding Freshman
Athlete award. That award was
established in 1960 to honor the
freshman athlete who showed
the most athletic ability
through his participation in one
or more sports. Herbert played
defensive back in football and
was a defenseman on W&L’s na-
tionally ranked lacrosse team.

Library Nears Completion

cont. from p. 1

want to go into the new facility
with a feeling of goodwill’ —and
one of happiness for the suc-
cessful completion of the
University’s  building-
development program of the
1970’s.
Ok OK

Mr. Leach is indeed a happy
man this fall. After two years of
dynamite and dust, his pet crea-
tion is standing: The solution to
one of W&L’s most frustrating
needs.

McCormick Library, built in
1941, was adequate in its day
day. It housed 110,000 volumes
for a student body of 710
undergrads. But by 1966, the
student body had already in-
creased by 50 percent, and the
number of library holdings
doubled. And in the past 12
years, W&L’s student popula-
tion became nearly 1,400—with
700 different courses taught
every year here, and a fivefold
growth of the library budget.

It was soon after the
“critical’’ label was put on in
the 1966 Self-Study report that
desperate work and research
began. Further renovation of
McCormick was impossible;
that facility became the logical
choice for the new commerce
school in the 1970’s as they con-
tinue to cram into Newcomb
Hall. By 1968, with President
Huntley’s arrival, the central
campus location was suggested
and approved. Board of
Trustees approval on construc-
tion came in 1970. Even so,
designs could not be finalized
until 1974, and funds remained a
consistent problem until 1976.
That summer, $5.4

million(from two estates) was
received by the University—
and with that signal, ground-
breaking began almost im-
mediately.

The new undergrad library is
already predicted to become
the center of the campus—and
no wonder. Roughly four times
larger than McCormick in
square feet, the building has
five floors. It is cleverly built to
straddle the rocky cliffside of
Woods Creek Valley, so that it
will not interfere with the
panorama of the front buildings
(it will be as high as the first
floor of Washington Hall,
descending four stories more in-
to the valley itself).

Billed as one of the most im-
pressive library structures in
the country, a brief comparison
with McCormick tends to back
up the statement. The new
library will seat over 800 peo-
ple, including some 560 in-
dividual carrels (the figures for
McCormick are 300 and 100,
respectively). Fully air condi-
tioned and carpeted, perhaps
the happiest news of all is that
the building will be open 24
hours a day. Two elevators will
serve all floors. And the back
wall of every floor will be
predominantly glass, with
study areas and lounge chairs
looking out over Lewis Hall and
the countryside beyond.

Increased space has allowed
for several other ‘‘extras’’ to be
included. An _ auditorium,
seating 100 people, will be open
to Contact and other speakers.
31 small locked studies, located
off the stacks, will be available
to faculty and honors thesis
students. And many other

“open”’ studies for typing study
sessions, etc., will be scattered
throughout.

Leach is returning the carrels
and open studies to the ‘‘squat-
ters’ rights’ system that used
to characterize McCormick
Library 20 years ago. There will
be no more set assignments to
these places. ‘‘With increased
space for students, we hope that
a rule of first-come, first-serve
will suffice and be respected,”’
Leach commented.

The stack space is an im-
pressive feature—able to ac-
comodate 500,000 volumes or
more. Present holdings will on-
ly fill 35-40% of this area, leav-
ing encouraging room for
growth.

Above all, the faculty is what
Leach called a ‘“‘low-abrasion
building.”’ The idea of a ‘‘main
reading room’’ has been done
away with, and students will
find comfortable areas all over
the 5 stories. The addition of the
small studies and seminar
rooms, he added, has the pur-
pose of retaining the communi-
ty atmosphere of McCormick
Library.

So the light is at the end of the
tunnel six months early for
W&L’s single most impressive
facility—a lasting reminder, in
Mr. Leach’s mind, of two main
points. As he said, “First, the
support and guidance of the
Board of Trustees was beyond
description, as they gave us
everything we could want. And
I believe the new library will
serve as a symbol for W&L’s
renaissance under Huntley in
the 1970’s—a rebirth that has
come to fruition in one short
decade.”’

Maatman Is Awarded

In late July, Washington and
Lee’s championship golfer,
Jerry Maatman, was awarded a
$1,500 N. C.A.A. post graduate
scholarship. Maatman, who
was an Honor Roll history stu-
dent, was the nation’s only col-
legiate golfer to win this
prestigious scholarship. Maat-
man’s four year career
culminated in his receiving All
American honors two years; a
first for Washington and Lee
golf. A graduate of New Trier
High in Wilamette, Illinois, he

Political Clubs

Speak Out

Young Democrats

College Republicans

by Lee Cave

The Washington and Lee
University Young Democrats
will hold their first meeting of
the new year next week at a
time soon to be announced. The
purpose of this meeting will be
to orient new members to the
organization. A guest speaker
and a short reception are plann-
ed.

After two years of building a
Young Democrats organization,
the club is ready to take an ac-
tivist role in local and state
politics.

Explains Ben Winn, Vice-
President of the organization,
“there are many issues this
year and it is time that the two
political clubs on this campus
start debating these issues. Of
particular concern are: a na-
tional energy policy, an
intelligently-made tax cut,
genocide in Cambodia, welfare
reform, civil service reform,
and archaic sex and marijuana
laws.”’

Campaign work will occupy
much of the club’s activities.
Andy Miller, who addressed the
W&L Young Democrats two
years ago, is the U.S. Senate
nominee. Says Lee Cave, the
club’s current president,
“Miller is one of the most ex-
perienced and credible can-
didates for the Senate from
Virginia in years. He has a good
record from his years as At-
torney General, and you can bet
that he will take Virginia’s
ideas on balanced budgets and
taxes to Washington. Miller is
hard-working and very familiar
with the state and its people.”

Membership to the YD’s will
be open for the next few weeks.
Everyone interested in joining
is invited to attend the club’s
first meeting.

by C. Randall Talley

The Washington and Lee
Republicans held their fall
membership drive Monday and
Tuesday, and response was
very good, according to Club
President John Saylor. Final
numbers are not yet available,
but Saylor said that, for a non-
presidential election year, he
was pleased with the results.

The Republicans’ first
meeting of the year will be
tonight at 7 p.m. in the Student
Center in rooms 112 and 113.
The meeting is for all who wish
to find out more about the Club
and its work. Some things
already planned are a picnic
behind Woods Creek Apart-
ments next Friday, with other
College Republican clubs
around the state coming to Lex-
ington to help kick off the school
year, bumper branding this
Saturday, campaign work with

‘some of the women’s colleges,

and mixers. Dates and times
will be announced closer to the
events. Guest speakers are also
being contacted.

Anyone who has not joined the
club and would like to can go to
the meeting tonight or call

Nugent at 463-4427.

VOLUME LXXVIII

by Randy Smith

In its first meeting of the
school year, the Executive
Committee, Washington and
Lee’s student government, reaf-
firmed last year’s ruling that all
student committee meetings be
open except for committee
votes. No issue can be voted on
in private that has not been
discussed during the public
meeting.

The only exceptions to the
rule are student honor trials,
Student Control Committee
hearings, and final decisions
made by the Student Activities
Board on the Fancy Dress Ball
theme.

In addition, the E.C. specified
that all committee meetings be
noticed around campus, with
the agenda and time, ‘‘well in
advance” of the meeting.

SAB meeting closed

The open meetings issue
came up after a Ring-tum Phi
reporter disclosed to junior
E.C. representative Steve

. Abraham that the SAB had clos-

OR

 

en Meetings Rule

Reaffirmed by E.C.

ed its meeting Sunday night to
the two reporters present ‘‘to
discuss Fancy Dress’’ and its
theme.

Abraham, who instigated the
open meetings rule last year,
said that “‘the idea behind open
meetings was that student body
funds are being“used and the
students should have a say”’ in
how the money is appropriated.

‘All meetings should be open
except for the final vote,”
Abraham reiterated.

Hank Hall, one of the co-
chairmen of the SAB, said that
his committee ‘‘closed the
meeting when we discussed
Fancy Dress, and, as far as I
know, it has always been done
that way.”

The other co-chairman, Doug
Jackson, said that if possible
themes are discussed in public
and in the newspaper,
“everybody will know about
Fancy Dress.” (Traditionally,
the theme of the annual Fancy
Dress Ball has been kept a
closely guarded secret. )

Jackson said that the SAB

gathers its input for Fancy
Dress suggestions ‘“‘from the
members of the board, who
have spoken with their
friends.”

“If you want student input, I
don’t see why you’re afraid to
have an open meeting about it,’”’
Abraham said.

Jackson replied that the SAB
relies on its members, “who
will keep the theme secret.”

“TI don’t understand your
(Abraham’s) lack of faith in the
SAB to make intelligent deci-
sions,’’ said Rob Calvert, senior
E.C. representative,

E.C. president Beau Dudley
added that the Executive Com-
mittee ‘‘bent over backwords to
get a representative group on
the SAB”’ last spring.

The result of the discussion
was a reaffirmation of the open
meeting rule with exceptions
for voting and the ‘‘final deci-
sions being made on the Fancy
Dress theme.’’ The distinction

Rock and Soul bands hired

for Homecoming weekend

by Dick Moss

In a unanimous decision Sun-
day night, the Student Activities
Board voted to hire two bands
for Homecoming Weekend. The
two banks, one rock and one
soul, will tentatively cost $2900,
well over half the $4000-$4500
the SAB had budgeted for the
weekend.

The rock band, Song Bird,
($850) and the soul band, the
Impressions, ($2000) were

among the most expensive
bands considered by the SAB in
the rock and soul categories,
which were the only two
musical categories suggested at
the meeting.

Other suggestions about
Homecoming Weekend discuss-
ed were a keg party in the Law
School field before the concert,
and the use of the old gym for
the concert itself. However, no
definite. decision was reached

on these matters, especially on
the use of the old gym, which
must be approved first by Dick
Miller of the Physical Educa-
tion department.

Other important matters
discussed at the meeting includ-
ed the need for a banquet
license for Zollman’s Pavilion
from the Alcohol Beverage Con-
trol Board (ABC). According to
finds by SAB members, there

_IFC to go to City
Council about noise

by David Greer
and Randy Smith

Interfraternity Council presi-
dent Jim Davis will present a
list of fraternity “concessions”
to the noise ordinance to the
Lexington City Council tonight
in an attempt to gain some
police ‘‘bending” of the city’s
noise restrictions for fraternity
parties.

This action follows a meeting
between Lexington Police Chief
James A. Kirby, City Manager
John Doane, Washington and
Lee Student Body president
Beau Dudley, assistant Dean of
Students Dan Murphy, and
Davis last Friday afternoon.

The IFC voted last Thursday
night to send Davis and Dudley
to Chief Kirby with the list of
“concessions” in the hope that
the Lexington police would en-
force the city’s noise ordinance
less stringently. Both Kirby and
Doane suggested that the
students approach the City
Council with their suggestions.

Dudley said that it is
necessary to present the pro-
posals to both the police and ci-
ty hall because the police only
have limited “‘discretion as to
what laws they can waive’’ and
both bodies must agree to in-
formal changes in the law.

Proposed ‘‘concessions”’

The proposed ‘‘concessions”’
include the agreement that
fraternities will have parties
only on one designated
weeknight with all music turned
off at 1 a.m. Weekend parties
will also have a cut-off time,
although the specific time has
not yet been voted on by the
IFC. a

Failure for a fraternity to
comply with these guidelines
will result in a $100 fine for the
first offense and Judicial Board
action for subsequent offenses.

The police, in exchange, it is

hoped, will not enforce the or-
dinance unless violations occur
after the agreed-to hour, and
will issue warnings before ar-
resting offenders. (Kirby has
ordered that no warnings be
given.)

It is also hoped that the police
will only act on a citizen com-
plaint, and will not enforce the
ordinance during the daylight
hours.

In addition, the students will
attempt to gain special permis-
sion to waive the noise or-
dinance completely on W&L’s
three big weekends—
Homecoming, Fancy Dress,
and Spring weekend.

Last Friday

Although no agreement was
reached in last Friday’s ©
meeting, Davis said Kirby was
interested in the IFC’s sugges-
tions, except for the daylight ex-
emption proposal.

Kirby added that the students
would have to approach the City
Council with a petition to have
special permission to have no
cut-off, fime for music on the
threedig weekends.

Davis said that despite these
problems, “It looks pretty
good; I think they’ll go for it.”’

Dissention

Not all fraternities agreed
with the concessions, however.

Sigma Nu president John
Craig did not agree with the
idea of automatic shutdown
hours regardless of noise levels
and the limit of one night per
week for parties. His house a:id
Kappa Alpha did not accept the
concessions.

Phi Gamma Delta felt that

the police’s end of the whole

deal was vague and too open-
ended.

Andy Fitzgerald, president of
Phi Kappa Psi, said that his

Ring-tum Phi Interview

Frank Parsons: W&L’s Man

by Neil Pentifallo

Ten years ago a girl working
in the duplicating center of
Washington and Lee University
took copies of material up three
flights to her boss. She was sure
the copy was perfect. Her
supervisor pulled out a metal
ruler, and showed her the copy
was off center of the original by
1/32 of an inch. He did not repri-
mand her, but showed her that a
metal ruler is more accurate
that the wooden ruler she used.

Frank A. Parsons expects the
employees of the university to
do their best and continually
learn to improve their per-
formance. The difference bet-
ween Parsons and other ad-
ministrators is that he usually
accomplishes this.

Parsons’ demand for perfec-
tion is combined- with a:
thorough knowledge of many
fields. When the duplicating’
center ordered an offset press,,-
Parsons knew how to run it:
when it was delivered. (He:
showed the company salesman,
how it should be run...)

He has held a multitude of
positions at W&L, (every posi-
tion, it seems, except janitor).
He came to W&L as Director of
Information Services (since
renamed the News Office), but
soon assumed more duties.

Under President Fred C.
Cole, (1959-1967) Parsons was
put in charge of institutional
research. This turned out to be
a ‘diluted job,’’ Parsons ex-
plains, because he was not able
to devote energy to any par-
ticular field. Not only did he
coordinate the school’s public
relations efforts, but he wrote
Cole’s speeches, supervised the

  

a?

  
 
   

 

tant to the president” and the ‘‘Curator of Trees and Squirrels.”’

photography was sparked. Bob
Keefe, Director of the News Of-
fice, estimates that 35 people
now have the responsibilities
that Parsons juggled at one
time.

Parsons did not expect to
become so immersed in his

development program. Presi-
dent Cole felt that institutional
and federal assistance were
more important than alumni
fund-raising, and phased out the
development program. He later
decided to reverse this trend,
and Parsons teamed with Far-

Parsons bills himself as the ‘‘general purpose administrative assis-

Damascus Road?

Parsons also listed his posi-
tion as being Curator of Trees
and Squirrels, referring to when
he became a celebrity at the
Dept. of Health, Education and
Welfare. Parsons was working
on an endlessly long application
for funds to be used in building
W&L’s proposed new library.
HEW wanted to know if the new
library would ‘‘create or
precipitate an identifiable long-
term change in the diversi-
ty of species within its natural
habitat?”’ After several idiotic
questions such as this, Parsons
decided to beat the bureaucrats
at their own game. He wrote
that ‘‘the squirrels are the most
visible inhabitants of the site,
but there are occasional
sightings of rabbits, skunks,
and snakes. No effort has been
made to date to determine
whether these are residents or
transients. Some birds nest in
trees that will be removed, but
as noted earlier, there is no
scarcity of other, equally
suitable trees that will re-
main.”’

 

When the duplicating center ordered an offset press,
Parsons knew how to run it, and even showed the
company salesman how it should be run

 

alma mater. He wanted to pur-
sue a career in journalism, and,
was working for the Clifton
Forge Daily Review when he
was called to- W&L. President
Gaines (1930-1959) was in the
midst of expelling football
players from school because of
a cheating scandal, and his
director of public information
resigned. The head of the jour-
nalism department made
several recommendations to

 

WE&L’s last “jack-of-all-trades”

 

duplicating center, handled
sports publicity, was curator of
Lee Chapel, and organized a
self-study report. He also put
out the alumni magazine, which
he says ‘‘was a lick and a pro-
mise’’ but nevertheless an ac-
complishment considering his
other r2sponsibilities. He even
had to take his own picture for
the magazine, and an interest in

Gaines for a replacement, and
Parsons’ name was high on the
list. Parsons recalls that there
is a story that his baldness got
him his job, because Gaines
supposedly wanted someone
mature. All it took was one look
at Parsons’ head to land him the
position.

Parsons was instrumental in
later years in rebuilding the

ris Hotchkiss to delve into the
project.

Soon after, Cole resigned as
president and Robert E.R.
Huntley was selected. Hot-
chkiss assumed the duties of
Director of Development from
Parsons, and Parsons was mov-
ed to his present position. He
now coordinates planning for
the university, and describes
his job in a mouthful as being a

“general purpose admin-
istrative assistant to the presi-
dent.”

According to one campus of-
ficial, Parsons “has a situa-
tional humor...He has a genteel
way of pointing out the absurdi-
ty of some situation or pro-
posal.’”’ Parsons lists his
research topics as being ‘Adolf
Hitler—Misunderstood Good
Guy?”’ and another as being
“U.F.0’s and the Bible—What
Really Happened on _ the

“It will be difficult to tell if
they’re unhappy about having
to find new trees to live in and
sport about. Otherwise no
change in their behavior pat-
tern is anticipated.”

“The library would appear to
have no capacity for affecting
the squirrel’s or other animal’s
genes.”

Soon copies of the ‘‘squirrel
memo” began to appear all
over the HEW web. Parsons
received a letter from the direc-

Behind the Scenes

tor of the agency saluting
Washington and Lee and
wishing that ‘“‘your squirrels
and your great university co-
exist in harmony for many,
many years.”

Parsons explains that a lot of
his job is filling out forms for
the federal government or in-
stitutions. He claims to have a
D.F.A. (Doctor of Federal Aid),
and an M.S. degree (Master of
Squirrels).

Parsons also has a ‘‘super-
ficial interest” in comics. He
plans to present a paper on
them to That Club, a discussion
group in which members cover
different topics. He plans to sell
his comic collection, which
numbers in the hundreds, after
he presents his paper.

Parsons complains that the
nature of his present work gives
him less personal satisfaction
than his earlier responsitilities.
He said that he had more tangi-
ble items when he would write a
speech for Cole, or see the end
result of his work on the alumni
magazine. “‘Now,”’ he says, “I
take pride in what others do
around me and when they
receive recognition.’”’ He ex-
plains that even though he can
look at the Law School and ap-
preciate the planning that he
was so intricately a part of,
there still were many others in-
volved in the project.

Parsons does not brag about
his work; in fact, he is rather
humble. He is glad that he
doesn’t have to work on the
alumni magazine, or sports
publicity, or take pictures for
the school, because ‘‘profes-
sionals are now doing that
work, and much better than I
could.” But how comforting to
know that in the midst of all the
“‘professionals,’’ W&L still has
one last jack-of-all-trades left.

 

 

Homecoming weekend set

(continued from page one)
never was a license for
Zollman’s and the ABC has just
now insisted that there be one.
This applies even for parties
where students provide their
own beverages. Also, no tickets
are to be sold at the door, but
only in advance of any
Zollman’s parties.

Doug Jackson, co-chairman
of the SAB, said that he ‘‘feels
confident that we can get the
license’’ but also said that the
SAB will not apply for it until
after Christmas break. The
reason, according to Jackson, is

that the faculty has pressured
the SAB to have no Thursday
night parties, but has consented
to one Thursday night party at
Zollman’s during Fancy Dress
this year. The faculty, ac-
cording to Jackson, will not con-
sider any other Thursday night
parties this year by the SAB.

In related matters, the SAB is
planning a rebuttal to the
University Council’s suggestion
that Fancy Dress weekend be
held inside the Washington holi-
day this winter.

The SAB also decided to fix
the movie rate at $1 again this

year, with slightly higher prices
on more popular movies. Just
where the movies will be shown
this year is still undecided.

 

 

Correction

The Interfraternity Council
regrets the publication last
week of a statement that Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity had
been fined $20 because their
rush official had passed out
from drunkenness at a rush
function. Phi Gamma Delta was
not at fault and the IFC regrets

the error.

country whose language the ap-
plicant speaks with some
degree of fluency. Dr. Turner
said that most W&L students
have received grants to either
France or West Germany.

Since the program started in
1948, Washington and Lee men

have received scholarships
every year except one. The
most in any one year was four
and last year we had two
scholars. One of these, Mark
Bradley, also received a
Rhodes scholarship. This situa-
tion has only happened once
before, and Dr. Turner said that
both men took the Rhodes
scholarship because it is for two
full years of study at Oxford and
is even more prestigious than
the Fulbright. The Fulbright is
renewable but it is a relatively
rare occurance.

The scholarship program was
started by Senator J. William
Fulbright and was originally in-
tended to serve as a repayment
for the Lend-Lease program of
World War II. Each country
which sponsors scholarships
has a national board composed
of American professors who
select students to receive
grants. Professor Jenks is on
the national board for Austria.

Change in IFC

weekend proposed

by David Greer

Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent Jim Davis and Bill Mauck
proposed changing IFC
weekend, traditionally held in
the fall, to the spring. They
pointed out that the only
available weekends are two
that either conflict with Hollins’
Fall Weekend or the weekend
following Homecoming.

The spring date will have the
advantages of better weather
and more available funds. It is
hoped that food can be served
as well as beer. A band will also
be \ featured. The fraternities
voted to accept the change.

In other business, Rush
Chairman Chris Volk said that
it is alright for fraternities to in-
vite freshmen down for meals.
He added that there will be no
contact Friday except for Dorm
Rush and the scheduled Rush
Dates. He also said that it is
permissable to give bids at
times other than the Rush
Dates.

Phi Delta Theta was fined ten
dollars for returning two
freshmen late after the {first
rush date. Sigma Nu and Pi
Kappa Alpha were also charged
with late returns and the matter
is being looked into by the IFC
Judicial Board.

This year, 505 grants to fifty-
two countries will be given.
Most of these are given for
European countries and
Washington and Lee alumni
have only gotten scholarships to
European countries in the past.

The Institute of International
Education in New York is the
governing body for this pro-
gram and processes all the ap-
plications. This organization
notifies accepted students
sometime in January for the
coming year. Dr. Turner said
that no student should hesitate
to apply because almost all ma-
jors are represented among the
current Fullbright scholars. In-
terested students should con-
tact Dr. Turner for an applica-
tion or to answer any questions
which they might have.

However, the deadline is Oc-
tober 25, so if anyone is in-
terested, they should talk to Dr.
Turner within the next two
weeks.

open store *
in Lexington

Alan Kendrick

Three Washington and Lee
graduates have recently opened
a store for retail backpacking
equipment.

The store, Rockbridge Outfit-
ters, is located at the intersec-
tion of Jefferson and Main
Streets, just off the W&L cam-
pus.
Christopher Camps and Doug
Perkins, who graduated from
W&L last year, and John Scott,
class of 1975, opened the shop
last week.

Camps stated that the store
would make available for pur-
chase on sight many items of
quality name-brand backpacks,
tents, sleeping bags, boots,
clothing, and accessories that
were previously available to
Lexington area residents only
through mail-order catalogs
and that prices would often be
lower than those of the large
mail-order companies.

The outdoorsman who is sick
of getting the wrong size, color,
shape, design, or model in the
mail and doesn’t have the cash
for a bus ticket to the Freeport,
Maine store can now take a few
hundred yards hike to the new
retailer.

In walking into the rustic
store, which has walls done ina
variety of eyecatching inlaid
work, one can find all the
necessities a serious
backpacker needs for a com-
fortable outing. Flyweight
backpack tents by Northface,
Cureka, and Camp Trails,
designed for snow or summer
climate, are set up for examina-
tion in between racks of attrac-
tive, comfortable clothing made
by Coming Attractions and
other handmade clothing com-
panies. Raichle and other hik-
ing and climbing boots and
Dunham hunting boots in all

a ee

-- Seated, from left, Denis cq J. Brion, visiting assis-
ofessor of law, and Jay B. Labov, assistant professor
stant mathematics professor; William M. Hartog, ad-
professor of philosophy, and Jean C. Dunbar, assistant pro-

sizes are ready for a trial walk
around the store. And
backpacks, from the tiniest day
packs to the largest, strongest,
best engineered frame packs
may be tried out.

The three partners stated that
they would make every effort to
aid outdoors enthusiasts in
making their plans. A complete
series of the Appalachian Trail
Maps are available and clinics
can be set up with experts in
areas of hiking, camping, clim-
bing, canoeing and skiing.

In addition, high quality snow
skiing equipment (by Beconta:
Kastle skis, Dolomite boots,
LookNevada bindings and
Beconta poles) is available for
purchase or rental, making
possible safer and more en-
joyable skiing on Virginia and
Carolina slopes.

The store also features hand-
crafted local products, ac-
cording to Scott. Available will
be excellent stained glass,
leathercraft and woodcraft pro-
ducts. Local craftsmen are in-
vited to distribute goods
through the store on consign-
ment. An excellent assortment
of frisbees and boomerangs is
also stocked.

For years, one of the most
pleasurable and prestigious ac-
tivitees for W&L men has been
that of backpacking through the
scenic Appalachian Mountains
running so close to campus. The
backpacking man has always
been held in the highest regard
by members of the nearby
women’s colleges. But woe to
the student who arrived on cam-
pus without several years worth
of carefully accumulated equip-
ment: all plans for a_ spec-
tacular weekend would soon
disappear into thin air. Now,
there is a convenient alter-
native.

The End dies

On the vine

by Dick Barron

Last week I attempted to give
you a brief summary of the
more appealing films of the
summer. Now that fall is upon
us, we must endure the late ar-
rivals — those films which are
fresh from summer runs and
are just now chugging into Lex-
ington. One of those summer
leftovers is Burt Reynolds’ The
End. You could say that this
movie was a leftover when it
was put into the can.

Reynolds directs and stars in
this film about a man who is
rapidly dying from a rare
‘‘blood disease.’’ When
Reynolds is informed of his ill-
ness, we become quickly aware
that black comedy takes a
beating in this film. The jokes
come at a fast and furious pace,
but lines requiring tact are
delivered with the finesse of the
Titanic in ice-berg country.

There is a certain way of
delivering a throw-up joke —
it’s either crude or it’s funny.
Mel Brooks, for instance, is
masterful in being crude and
funny at the same time (anyone
who has seen Blazing Saddles
will understand). Unfortunate-
ly, Reynolds starts crude and
stays crude.

This boat is not altogether
sunk becamuse Dom DeLuise is
there to start bailing. Consider-
ing the material he has to work
with (as written by Jerry
Belsen), DeLuise gives a
masterful performance as the
schizoid mental hospital pa-
tient. The funniest moments
come when he argues and con-
verses with himself and his
alter-ego. These scenes give the
movie a few badly needed signs
of life.

Sally Field is as cute and sexy
as ever, but adds no real
substance to this thin story.
Maybe it really is true that less
is more, for it seems that the

 

most humorous moment in the
film was when Reynolds spots a
mental patient making
beautifully screeching bird
sounds. Whoever that guy is,
he’s a comic genius.

Burt Reynolds has been the
creator of some excellent rip
roarin’ entertainment. Smokey
and the Bandit, although lack-
ing literary merit (who cares
anyway?) was an exciting bit of
Americana — the old let’s-beat-
the-system-and-come-away-
rich type of film that gives lots
of action and some gentle folksy
homor to liven things up.
Reynolds should stay away
from the demanding roles of
black comedy. He is too good at
what he does best. The End is
not altogether a bad film, but at
its worst, it makes Reynolds ap-
pear slightly foolish for getting
involved with such a limp pro-
ject.

Those who missed ABC’s Bat-
tlestar Galactica Sunday night
lost out on what could be called
the second coming of Star Wars.
Lorne Greene and a cast of
strange characters, gives us a
look at the world of intergalac-
tic space travel. It’s Star Trek
with a twist — the Galactica is
trying to find earth instead of
trying to find “‘strange new
worlds.”’

With outstanding special ef-
fects by John Dykstra (Star
Wars( it just can’t lose. The
premier episode has already
launche a long list of catch
phraes. So, one Sunday night, if
you feel like cutting through the
“felgercarb’’ of the other net-
works, instead of going out and
walking your ‘“‘daggit,’’ pause
for a “‘micron,’’ tune in ABC,
and let Lorne Greene take you
on a tour of that great
Ponderosa in the sky.

AN ENSEMBLE OF 16 students from the
University last week on a cultural-exchange mission, and gave a 90-minute performance of traditional
Chinese dances, music and other art forms on the terrace in front. of Lee Chapel. The event drew more than
400 spectators to the W&L front campus.

by John R. Risch

If you happened to be on
Washington and Lee’s front
campus last Thursday after-
noon, you may have found
yourself in a atmosphere much
like Central Park’s in New York
City. Professors, students, and
Lexington residents gathered
around the new terrace in front
of Lee Chapel for one of the
most vivid cultural per-
formances ever to come to
W&L. The Youth Good-Will Mis-
sion of The Republic of China
entertained their audience with
an hour and a half program con-
sisting of many Chinese art
forms including, song, music,
defense, dance and painting.

These Taiwanese students
are non-professional _ per-
formers whose college majors
range from Banking and In-
surance to Home Economics.
Under the direction of Dr. You-
Hsin Chien, Dean of Engineer-
ing at Tamkang College, these
students performed as a
gesture to reciprocate the ex-
hibition of the Reeves Chinese
Porcelain Collection in Taiwan
this past July.

100 peices of the Reeves Col-'
lection were displayed for the

first time ever in the Republic
of China. In return, The Youth
Good-Will Mission dicided they
would come to W&L and bring
to life many of the figures pic-
tured on the Chinese Export
Porcelain. Sponsored by a
television station in Taiwan,
these students will give 32 such
performances during their 50
day stay in the United States.

The talent of these students
was surpassed only by the fan-
fare of color generated by their
oriental costumes. Each section
of the program artistically
touched upon many traditions
of Chinese culture. The chorus
sang four traditional folksongs,
the most dynamic being ‘The
Plum Flower.” The plum
flower is the national flower of
the Republic of China.

Instrumentally these students
are quite accomplished using
unique Chinese instruments
such as: the bamboo flute, lute,
wood blocks, and butterfly
guitar. Their’ graceful
demonstration of Chinese Kung-
Fu and boxing, fully
characterized the quick thought
and skilled coordination
necessary to this form of com-
bat. The shouting one might
have heard during the
demonstration is a warning call
the attacker gives in order to
give his opponent a chance to
dodge his strike.

 

Datz offers
workshop

A workshop for acoustic
guitar will be offered to
students this fall. Major topics
to be covered include folk
styles, bluegrass _ styles,
reading of tablature, music
theory, and flat-picking techni-
ques. Meetings will be held
every Thursday at 8:00 in the
Mu Beta Psi room, located in
the Student Center below the
Cockpit.

The workshop will be con-
ducted by Burr Datz. He has
played bluegrass professionally
for five years, and has given
private lessons for the past six
years. For further details, con-
tact him in Evans Dining Hall,
or call ext. 236.

Republic of China (Taiwan) visited Washington and Lee

Chinese students perform

The most colorful segment of
the program was the “Chinese
Ribbon Dance.”’ They dance
around while waving foot-long
silk ribbons through the air
creating the effect of brilliant
clouds. Much time a practice is
spent in learning this art.

The “‘Lion Dance” is a dance
that all Chinese men must
learn. The lion requires two
men to control it, one controll-
ing the colorful lion head while
the other controls the rear. The
“Lion Dance” is quite similar to
the well-known ‘Dragon
Dance”’ which requires 50 men
to perform. Both dances are
performed during Chinese New
Year celebrations and at
special religious ceremonies.
These dances also serve as a
method of training for Kung-Fu.

‘Also included in this program

was a demonstration of Chinese
Brush Painting. One of the
female students painted a
branch of plum blossoms in only
five minutes, an art that takes
several years to accomplish.

The painting was presented to
Dean Watt as a gift to W&L. The
program was brought to a close
as the group sang and danced to
three traditional American
songs: ‘‘Oh Susanna,’’ ‘‘As the
Saints Go Marching In’’ and
“T’d Like to Teach the World to
Sing,’’ as an effort to express
the unity and friendship which
is sought by both nations.

After the performance a
reception was held at the Alum-
ni House where all ‘ were
welcome. Since all the sutdents
could speak fluent English,
there were no communication
problems. Dean Watt and Mr.
Whitehead presented each stu-
dent with a special gift and a
souvenir booklet of W&L.

Special thanks must be given
to Professor I-Hsiung Ju, artist-
in-residence, for making this
cultural exchange possible.
Professor Ju, a native of China,
has worked hard in broadening
East Asian studies at W&L and
in trying to closen the ties be-
tween the W&L community and
the fascinating culture of his
homeland. Hopefully, W&L will
again be honored with similar
cultural exchanges in the
future.

The Kuhne exhibit, on view from Sept. 18 through Oct. 6 in duPont Hall on the W&L campus, is the first
exhibit in a visiting artist series which has been organized in cooperation with Dr. and Mrs. Jacob Weins-

tein.

Dr. and Mrs. Weinstein, who own Jacobs Ladder Gallery in Washington, D.C., and are parents of a W&L
alumnus, have worked closely with the Department of Fine Arts in contacting artists for the new series. Dr.
and Mrs. Weinstein have been friends of the university and its art programs for several years, and have
recently established a fund to enable W&L students to study with practicing artists.

During the first week of the exhibit in the duPont Gallery, Kuhne will visit with W&L art students and
conduct discussions in university art classes.

The public is encouraged to attend the reception Friday, which will take place from 7 to 9 p.m.

 

 

Eye And Ear:
Som The Bookstore

Why did the textbooks cost so
much this year? We, of the
Bookstore staff, were braced
for the shock which we knew
was coming at book rush. (We
even considered having smell-
ing salts, brandy and other
restoratives at hand for severe
cases.) As we unpacked and
shelved textbooks by the
truckload this summer, it
became strobe-light clear that
the prices had jumped in giant
leaps.

The economies of the tex-
tbook business are complex and
baffling even to those who sell
them. First off, the Bookstore,
which is owned and operated by
the University, is not a get-rich
operation. It is an essential part
of the academic process, yet it
must be self-sustaining. It must
pay such overhead costs as
salaries, shipping, phone, etc.,
etc. The publishers of textbooks
set a ‘recommended selling
price” for each book and, ex-
cept for some paperbacks, we
pay 80% of the recommended
price PLUS the freight charges
to get those heavy tomes to Lex-
ington, Va., from New Jersey,
Illinois, Minnesota, or Califor-
nia. The textbooks at W&L are
always marked at that recom-
mended price; hauling costs
are never added on.

Next question: who is making
the profit when the same book
goes up a dollar or two in less
than a year? We _ textbook
managers are apt to feel that
the publishers have all the
gravy. However, they certainly
spend time, money and the
charm of lots of simple or
elaborate charts to show that
they are hurting as much as the
poor student. Yet it has been
pointed out (by textbook
managers, of course!) that the
stock of publishing houses runs
ahead of the market on The
New York Stock Exchange: a
good investment.

And what of the faculty which
is the third leg of this sky-
roketing stool? Their role is
simple. They choose the books
which the store will order and
the publisher will ship. The
faculty’s primary concern is, of
course, academic excellence
but many of them do keep a
wary eye on the ballooning
prices.

Next spring the Bookstore
will institute a full-fledged used-
book program. And it is here
that the faculty will play a key
role, by deciding early in May
what books they will use in the
fall of 1979. This will give the
students an opportunity to sell
back to The Bookstore books
which are in good condition. So
the students, in their own self-
interest, should treat those ex-
pensive texts with respect. The
economically wise student will
not use his textbooks to jack up
a flat tire and will hold back on
the gaudy underlining.

WLUR

Beginning this Sunday night
at 10, and continuing every
week throughout the fall term,
WLUR-FM will present a one
hour rock concert. The fall con-
cert series will include live per-
formances by the Who, Bruce
Springsteen, the Electric Light
Orchestra, Peter Gabriel, and
many others. Program Director
Mark Mainwaring indicated
that the tapes to be used came
from a variety of sources, but
emphasized that ‘‘they’re not
the usual live albums available
in any record store. We’ve got a
lot of different material, and
almost all of it is commercially
unavailable.’’ This Sunday’s
concert will feature Elton John,
recorded live at the Montreal
Forum in 1974. WLUR may be
found at 91.5 on the FM dial.

Crafty Hands
Happy the Man
Arista AB 4191

Who are these guys? Sure, the
names are easy enough—
Stanley Whitaker, Frank
Wyatt, Kit Watkins, Rick Ken-
nell, and Ron Riddle. But who
are they? What bands have they
played with? Where do they
come from? I can’t answer any
of these, but I do know who this
band sounds like. Take three
parts Genesis, two parts ELP,
one part each of Jeff Beck and
Jan Hammer, season lightly
with Rick Wakeman and Yes,
and PRESTO—Happy the Man.
First the good news: it’s not
quite as derivative as it seems it
might be. Unfortunately, on
their new album these guys pro-
vide a perfect example of that
which the above mentioned ar-
tists (with the exception of Jeff
Beck) have been accused of
producing for years; namely,
the type of pretentious,
ponderous music that promises
all and delivers nothing.

“THE CHEAP DETECTIVE 53

 

Musical Mainstream

by Mark Mainwaring and Robin Meredith

It’s a pity, because the band’s
first LP, while showing all the
above influences, demonstrated
a fair amount of instrumental
virtuosity and melodic innova-
tion. The instrumental talent is
still there on the second record;
the songs aren’t. With one or
two exceptions, the tracks on
Crafty Hands just don’t go
anywhere. It all makes for very
nice background music, but not
the kind of stuff worth going out
and spending six bucks on.

MM
Who Are You
The Who
MCA - 3050

First, the review in a nut-
shell: the Who are back with a
vengence. Now the qualifier:
anyone expecting the raw
power of “My Generation” or
Quadrophenia’s ‘“‘The Real Me”’
is gonna be disappointed in Who
Are You. See, it’s just not that
kind of record.

If you reveled in the majesty
of Tommy, or the more subdued
power of Who’s Next, however,
your ship’s just come in. Among
other things, Who Are You
marks the return of the syn-
thesizer as a significant force in
the Who’s music (and it was the
synthesizer that created much
of the tension and joy of Who’s
Next). My associate Robin
Meredith maintains that Pete
Townsend is the only man in the
world who should be allowed to
touch a synthesizer. I don’t

agree, but must admit that Who
Are You tends to support his
claim. Maybe it’s a _ coin-
cidence, but three of the
album’s best songs are ones in
which Townsend uses the in-
strument to create a particular
feeling. In “New Song,” the
synthesizer lurks in the rhythm
section, accentuating the drums
and helping to set the pace.
“Sister Disco’’ finds the instru-
ment being used for both
rhythm and melody—the latter
primarily taking the form of
brief passages to move things
along after Roger Daltrey’s
slower vocal breaks. And last
but not least, the title track’s a
killer, in which a quick syn-
thesizer and acoustic guitar
break culminate in a strong
finish to bring back memories
of the classic ‘‘Won’t Get Fooled
Again’’. It’s not that good, but
the feel is similar. Add that to a
couple of tunes—expecially
“Guitar and Pen’’) which are
throwbacks to the old Tommy
days, and this LP is a winner for
even the marginal Who fan.
Who Are You was well worth
the wait.

Miscellaneous Notes: On the

to be Detroit’s best-kept secret,
a rocker with a_ fanatic
hometown following but virtual-
ly unknown on the national
level. He finally hit it big, of
course, with the double
platinum Night Moves, and
hasn’t looked back since.

RING-TUM PHI

  

Franke—from

mats to courts?

by Ray McNulty
In June 1978 Gary Franke,
W&L’s head wrestling coach,
’ was named head coach of the
W&L tennis team. Franke, a
1971 graduate of Mankato State
(Minnesota), is starting his
sixth year at W&L. His wrestl-
ing teams have won ODAC
championships the past two
seasons and Franke was named
the ODAC,s Wrestling Coach of

the Year. .

The new tennis coach is mov-
ing into a program which has
also been successful in the past.
Both the 1976-77 and the 1977-78
W&L tennis Generals finished
second nationally in the Divi-
sion III national tournament.
The former W&L tennis coach,
Dennis Bussard, resigned after

_ the 1978 season to accept:a posi-
tion with Babson College in
Massachusetts.

Coach Franke will have a
strong nucleus of returning let-
termen to build his team
around. Stewart Jackson, a
junior, was an All-American
last year and is the captain of
this year’s squad. Juniors Dave
Constine and Pat Norris were
both voted to the All-Conference
team and will join Jackson on
the 1978-79 team.

The major question is, ‘‘Can a
wrestling coach, who never
played tennis co etitively in
high school or college, take over
as head coach of a team that
finished second in the Division
III national tournament and
continue its winning tradition?”’
It is the opinion of this sport-
swriter that he can. After obser-
ving his tennis physical educa-
tion class, I was greatly im-
pressed with Coach Franke’s
knowledge of the sport. He ap-
peared to know a great deal
about tennis strategy, the
mechanics of the game and he

also has made himself very
familiar with the tennis

rulebook. I think Coach
Franke,s biggest asset is his
ability to establish a good rap-
port with his athletes. I have
spoke to a few of Franke’s
wrestlers and they had nothing
but good things to say about
their coach.

I asked Coach Franke how he
had improved his familiarity
with the game of tennis since
his appointment as head coach.
He said that he had done some
reading over the summer on the
mechanics of the sport, but
most of his knowledge came
from a friend who once coached
at the University of Minnesota.
Franke said he and his friend,

_ who was a Davis Cup member,

discussed the various areas of
the game, including the

physical and emotional aspects .

of tennis.

The tennis team opens its fall
schedule this weekend and I
think it will be interesting to see
how the team reacts to its new
head coach. I believe that
Coach Franke will do a com-

mendable job and the tennis -

team will be successful again
this year. .

Soccer team downed 3-0;

W&L goes 0-2 after Davidson

game — Centre Sat.

by Bill Whalen

The W&L Generals kicked off
the home portion of their 1978
season by meeting the Davidson
Wildcats last Saturday at
Wilson Field. The Generals,
bidding for their first victory of
the season, ended up on the
short side with a 34-7 decision.

Davidson started slowly as
they ran into a_ tenacious
General’s defense. W&L got the
first break of the game when
Davidson, attempting to punt,
mishandled the snap and turned
the ball over on their own 24.
The General’s offense was
unable to move the ball and
Randy Austin’s 39 yard field
goal attempt was blocked.
Davidson took over on their own

20 and proceeded to score their
first touchdown on a seven-
play, 80-yard drive. The score
came on a 45-yard pass from Al
Rhyne to Craig Pyles. Davidson
led 7-0 with five minutes left in
the first quarter.

In the second quarter W&L
drove deep into Davidson ter-
ritory but once again had to set-
tle for a field goal attempt by
Randy Austin, whose 25 yard at-
tempt missed to the right.

to be ready to score again but on

Cross country
season opens

by Greg Branan

The Cross-Country season
opens this Saturday with a
match against Davis and Elkins
on the opponent’s turf.

In the words of Coach Dick
Miller, “‘It’s going to be tough to
repeat'a 10-5 season.” That win-
loss record was compiled by
last years harriers and was the
most wins for any Cross- Coun-
try team here at Washington
and Lee, yet only managing a
fourth place finish in the Old

Dominion Athletic Conference.
Two of last year’s top five
runners, Alan Weeks and Bill

Welch were lost to graduation.

The top two returnees, and this
year’s co-captains, are Rich
Bird and Bob Bates. Brian
Adams, the only other returning
letterman, is recovering from
an illness and is expected to run
as soon as possible. Another of
last year’s front five, Chris
Daniel, is presently playing soc-
(continued on page 7)

unveil Saturday against the
Valley United Soccer Club of
Roanoke in -the Generals’ ex-
hibition match against this
amateur club. He feels that it
will be exciting and a ‘‘nice
game to watch.”’ Game time is 2
‘p.m. at W&L’s Wilson Field.
Washington and Lee has been
plagued by injuries to key

players during the pre-season, -

but the team hopes to be pulling
together in time for the match
Saturday. Coach Piranian felt

that his team showed “‘the abili- |

ty to play good soccer, but not
for ninety minutes’, as they
must keep up constant pressure
throughout the game. Hopeful-
ly, his new system will help to
alleviate this problem, as they

. will play a more aggressive and

exciting kind of game, putting
constant pressure on the ball,
and always looking to attack.
Coach Piranian says that W&L
“should be able to make better
use of our personnel’’ with his
changes.

In Valley United, the
Generals encounter a team they
have never beaten in six
previous exhibitions. Co-
captains Bill Stone and Roger

Yale, both seniors, will have to
rally their young team to
muster a strong effort for this
game, which is the final tuneup
before the tough part of the
schedule, including the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
games, is upon them. The
teams they have to worry about
this season are Lynchburg and
Eastern Mennonite among their
conference opponents, and
Elizabethtown from out of
state. There are a few games
which the Generals should have
no trouble readying themselves
for, as there exists ‘“‘bad blood”’,
as coach Piranian put it, bet-
ween W&L and Hampden-
Sydney, VPI, James Madison
and Roanoke College.

Looking ahead at _ the
schedule a bit, the Generals
travel to Averett College on
September 27, to Eastern Men-
nonite College on the 30th, and
to Hampden-Sydney on October
4. Their first regular season
home game isn’t until October 7
against Elizabethtown College,
and by then the soccer team
should know where it is headed
and how well Piranian’s system
works.

ed 53 yds. by Davidson’s John
Porter for the Wildcat’s 2nd TD.
Davidson now led 14-0 with 4:33
left in the half. The Generals
held off one last Davidson drive
when cornerback Jack Norberg
picked off Rhyne’s pass at the
W&L 23.

It was not until with 11:49 left
in the 3rd quarter that W&L
began their lone scoring drive.
With the ball on the W&L 29,
tailback Stewart Atkinson car-
ried down to the Davidson 19; a
run good for 52 yards. QB Scott
Swope then threw to Richard
Wiles at the 10 and Jim Palermo
carried the ball to the Davidson
2. Stewart Atkinson’s 1 yard
plunge gave W&L their only
score of the day. With 9:45 left
in the 3rd quarter it was David-
son 14, W&L 7.

On their next possession
Davidson drove to the W&L
eight. However, on a 3rd and
seven from the 8, Alvin Atkin-
son fumbled the ball giving the
Generals possession -on their
own six. Once again, the
Generals looked like they were
in control but the offense stalled
out and punted away, giving
Davidson the ball on their own
48. Craig Pyles 13 yd. run put
the ball on the W&L 30 and on
the next play Rhyne hooked up
with Atkinson for a 30 yd. TD
pass. It was now Davidson 21-
W&L 7 with 14:27 left in the 4th
quarter.

From here on it was all
Davidson. The Wildcats, in
their ‘‘wing-T”’ offense, ran six
rushing plays to go 71 yds. The
big play was Bill Johnson’s 37
yd. run for the score. It was now
Davidson 25-W&L 7 with 10:55
left in the game.

With: the outcome all but
decided, Davidson and W&L
substituted freely. Davidson
went 68 yds. on 8 plays for their
final score, with QB Dan Whit- '
myer scoring on a3 yd. run. The
PAT failed and the final score
was Davidson 34, W&L 7.

After only two games, the:
Generals must regroup. They
have lost both games badly.
Still, their mood is optimistic.

' According to Coach Gary

Fallon, ‘‘The players are still
enthusiastic, and there’s been
no talk of packing it in. Against
both Davidson and Madison we
faced teams with unusual size
and depth. We’ve_ been

. Substituting a lot and trying

players at new positions. In
both games we’ve- simply been

worn down through 4 quarters.’’

The Generals have been
outscored 83-14 in two games.
More importantly, they have
been outscored 55-7 in the se-
cond half, 41-0 in the 4th
quarter. Take away the 4th -
quarters of both games and the
scores would be 28-7 and 14-7.

The bright spots for the
Generals had to be the running
of Stewart Atkinson and the
defensive stands. The defense
stopped Davidson 4 times
within the W&L 30 and caused
the Wildcats to fumble ’8 times.
W&L recovered 5 fumbles‘gnd
made 1 interception. Atkinson
ran 14 times for 84 yards and 1
touchdown. He is now only 128
yds. from tying Randy Broyles’

Tennis begins «

by John Winans

In June of this year, Gary
Franke was named head tennis
coach of the Generals. The 1971
graduate of: Mankato State in
Minnesota has coached W&L’s
wrestling team for five years
with a great deal of success. He
was named 0.D.A.C. Coach of
the Year in 1977 for his superior
job during the 1976-77 season.
‘But these days Coach Franke’s
thoughts are running to tennis.

On September 22 the Generals
will travel to Annapolis, Md. to
participate in the Navy Fall In-
vitational. In this tourney and
the one at James Madison the
following week, Coach Franke
will be looking at the in-
dividuals and getting an idea on
player ranking for the coming
spring season. The fall tennis
season will conclude here in
Lexington on October 13-14 with
the Second Annual W&L Fall In-
vitational. The Generals will
have their hands full as
Maryland, Ohio, and Virginia
will all be present for what is
shaping up to be an exciting
Homecoming weekend tourney.

The squad has been practic-
ing now for two weeks and
Coach Franke is optimistic

about this year’s netmen:
Returnees, such as_ All-
American Stewart Jackson, are
not the only reason for his ex-
citement. Two or three top
freshmen will play a key roll in
the coming season. Gary is a
firm believer in physical condi-
tioning, so the tennis team has
been doing a lot to keep in
shape. The combination of
great tennis ability found in let-
termen as well as freshmen
players and Coach Gary
Franke’s great interest in stu-
dent athletes and intense desire
to produce a winner again this
year should make his tennis
debut a successful and rewar-
ding one.

we’re not going to give up!”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Fancy Dress:
the heat is on...

It’s time for a small reminder: The fate of the big-
gest social event at Washington and Lee is to be decid-
ed next Thursday.

For many years, several university officials have
bemoaned the cut classes and snoring students that
are a part of Fancy Dress Weekend. Last year,
enough of them served on the University Council to
make this recommendation:

The following motion has been submitted by two University
Council members for consideration at this meeting:

In order

(I) tore-establish a revered tradition,

(II) to allow students and others fully to prepare for and to enjoy
the variety of activities collectively denominated “Fancy Dress
Weekend,”’ without the distractions of classes and classwork,

(III) to allow students and others fully to prepare for and to enjoy
the variety of activities collectively denominated ‘‘School,”
without the distractions of parties and party-work,

(IV) To permit Fancy Dress events to occur on or near their
natural date, viz., Valentine’s Day,

(V) to boost the local economy while reducing student travel ex-
penditures, by inducing more people to remain in Lexington during
at least part of the winter break, and

(VI) to nurse back to health that casualty of overemphasis on
social life—an atmosphere of intellectual excellence.

Be it resolved that the various parts of “‘Fancy Dress Weekend”’
occur only during the ‘‘Washington Holiday.”

Embarrasingly cute for a student—faculty commit-
tee? Certainly. But it’s no joke; this motion will be
voted on next Thursday, September 28, at 4:30 p.m. If
passed, the motion will delight die-hard academicians
on two counts: stripping away the appeal of W&L’s
biggest party weekend, and making the most mileage
out of another hated gift to the students—the
Washington Holiday.

One should note that the membership of the U.C.
changes regularly, and some of the die-hard pro-
ponents are gone. But this motion is still a live one,
and the meeting ought to be worth seeing. If the fate
of Fancy Dress interests you, try to attend as the SAB
fights tosave a W&L tradition—academic or not.

(For those of you who really get inte committee-
room carnage, the Chi Psi case before the City Plann-
ing Commission is also scheduled for September 28 at
5 p.m. A pretty memorable double-feature...)

office
hours

Beau Dudley, president of the
Student body, has announced
that he will be holding regular
weekly ‘‘office hours’’
throughout the year. For the
fail term, they are scheduled
for 9 a.m.-12 noon on
Thursdays. During this time,
Dudley will be available in the
E.C. room in the University
Center for any opinions, sugges-
tions, or complaints.

On those open

committee meetings...

Last Monday, the Executive Committee held its
opening meeting of the year. Before too long, they
were again immersed in debate over one of last year’s
hottest issues: whether student committees should be
made to open their meetings to the entire student
body.

The argument has been kicking around for years,
but for the record, it runs something like this. Student
committee positions (SAB, Contact, Cold Check) are
open for anyone interested in applying. The EC tries
to pick these people on the basis of expertise and/or
interest in the area. Once appointed, these committee
members feel (with some reason) that as long as they
are accessible to outside opinion, they ought to be
allowed to ‘‘get on with the job.” And it’s a fact of life
that the more “‘open’’ these meetings are, the greater
the tendency is to lose any shred of organization and
control. As one disenchanted chairman said last year,
‘We deserve, at least, the credit to make an in-
telligent decision that reflects student opinions.”’

It’s a nice way thought, anyway. We ought to have
some faith in the people we elect or appoint to office.
Unfortunately, there are always a few bad apples in
the bunch. A little late-night arm twisting, a little
fiscal irresponsibility— and pretty soon, the credibili-
ty of each student official is in question. It’s not sur-
prising that students want to drift into a meeting oc-
casionally and see how their thousands of dollars in
student fees are being spent.

So that’s the choice: more student body input vs.
the effective organization of each committee. Either
extreme would be foolish; this year’s EC appeared to
recognize that fact on Monday.

The EC vote revolved around the meetings of one
group: the Student Activities Board, which controls
the major slice of student funds each year. In the
past, the mere mention of open meetings has sent the
average committee chairman under an oxygen tent.
But for once, both groups were able to give enough
ground to make possible the final policy vote. Briefly
stated, the motion requires advance notice on campus
when any major expenditure or decision is to be
discussed by the SAB; that all meetings be open until
a vote is to be taken—and (a new point) that nothing
can be voted on unless discussed in the open session;
and finally, that the SAB will still be allowed to plan
its Fancy Dress themes in secret, as tradition
démands. Regarding Fancy Dress, student opinion
will be solicited beforehand, in ‘‘open idea sessions”’
for themes and decorations. |

This new system is a good one, and an encouraging
sign. We thank the SAB Co-Chairmen for opening
their meetings with so little resistance. In fact, one
hopes that all the other student committees will be as
co-operative. For only after students have the op-
portunity to see how the decisions are made, can
there be a greater faith in our student officials.

Parking At W&L—

Only The Strong Survive

The following feature was
written by Robert S. Keefe,
director of the W&L New Office
and disgruntled bureaucrat...

The keys to running a suc-
cessful college: plenty of football
for the alumni, sex for the
students, and parking for the
faculty.

—CLARK KERR,
when he was
President of UCLA

If you lack confidence in the
ingenuity and imagination and
inventiveness of college kids to-
day, take heart. So what if they
can’t tell a participle from a
patella, and maybe they do
think the multiplication tables
are located in the biology lab.
Lock horns and match wits with
them in the classroom if you
must, but keep out of their park-
ing lots.

It used to be, as recently as
the late 1960s, that Washington
and Lee’s students simply
crammed their cars behind the
gym in a jumble that would
send any self-respecting traffic
engineer to the pacemaker
dispensary. You’d leave your

keys in the ignition, so the peo-
ple whom you’d blocked might
move your car if they were out
of class sooner than you. Even if
you were accustomed to driving
a big American car, you quickly
learned to maneuver a VW or
an Opel, or else you went to the
Co-op for coffee for a few hours.

(The faculty, of course, in-
sists that only the faculty is
reduced to driving VWs and
Opels, that the students all own
block-long Oldsmobiles and
Bentleys, or if a small car, then
at least a Porsche or a Jaguar.
Jealousy is a_ relentless
mistress. )

That pattern endured until six

or eight years ago, with the new
construction on the gym. In due
course, with yet other con-
struction planned on the
campus, Washington and Lee
determined to provide new
parkings areas for its students,
and hired the best parking-lot
designers money could buy.
And lo, a new lot, probably the
most attractive in Virginia or
maybe the world, was opened
near Lee Chapel with ap-
propriate fanfare. It was
designed to accommodate

precisely 68 cars, the number

that had been displaced from
the old 100-by-200 lot where the
gym addition now stands.

The new lot was engineered
within an inch of its life. It has
nooks and crannies
everywhere, bowered with ex-
otic shrubs and trees imported
from all over the world —
everything to distinguish it in
the most emphatic way possible
from your garden-variety
shopping-center parking lot.
And it would hold exactly 68
cars.

The students scoffed at
Washington and Lee and its
high-powered consultants. Sixty
eight cars! Before anyone knew
what happened, they developed
their own pattern for parking an
average of 98 cars there, almost
half again as many as the ex-
perts thought they could. And

generally thev do it without

blocking anyone else. (The ar-
chitects who designed the lot,
GWSM Inc., imported all the
way from Pittsburgh, are still
astonished.) When a student oc-
casionally does block in
another, the victim is absolute-
ly sanguine about it, according
to Frank A. Parsons, who as
assistant to the Washington and
Lee president is in charge of
such things. It doesn’t happen
often, he says, but when it does,
the reaction isn’t one of hysteria
but rather ‘“‘Okay, so maybe I’ll
block you in tomorrow.”’

Not long ago, Washington and
Lee began still more construc-
tion, this time building a new

library. And that meant a whole
lot of faculty parking had to be
eliminated.

Students are used to coping
with advertisty, but Doctors of
Philosphy are another species.
They shine in committee
meetings, but put them in a
real-life parking-lot crisis and
you ve got trouble with a capital
a:

So the university thought —
briefly — of changing the new
Lee Chapel lot from “B” to
‘A,” from upperclassmen to
faculty and staff. But even the
high-powered imported
parking-lot experts from Pitt-
sburgh had to admit defeat and
quash that silly notion. Displace

nearly a hundred students in
favor of 68 professors, and the
consequences would be
unimaginable and_ un-
controllable.

So the faculty lost. Students
now own and control the new
parking lot into which the
university frankly admits it
wouldn’t dare send its agents.
Professors park on side streets
halfway into the county or, if
they are smart, they walk to
school and boast about the exer-
cise they’re getting. Frank Par-
sons, the assistant to the presi-
dent, is one of the brave few

sions separates the open “idea
sessions’ from the ‘‘decision
making process.” The motion
passed by a vote of 8-1.

Meetings to be posted

In discussing the need for
scheduled student committee
meetings to be posted in ad-
vance, Dudley said that ‘the
students are entitled to know
about all weekly and special

meetings.”
Jackson asked him about
rushed, ‘‘emergency’’

meetings, especially regarding
the short-notice situation when
booking bands.

“T think it’s just as dangerous
if a quote-unquote emergency
situation comes up, that you
take action and justify it later,”’
Dudley replied.

Following his logic, the E.C.
ruled that all meetings and
their agenda be posted ahead of
time ‘‘whenever possible’’ to
maximize student input.

Committee deficits

Grant Leister, business
manager of last year’s Calyx,
attributed the yearbook’s $2,275
loss to publishing costs and
“editorial irresponsibility.”

Although every deadline was
met, he said that the editor,
Temp Webber, had submitted

60 ‘,junk’’ pages, or pages the
editor knows will have to be
changed later. Each ‘‘junk”
page costs $10 to alter.

Leister said the publication
also paid $1,200 more ‘‘than ex-
pected” for color photography.

“This (the deficit) reflects
pretty badly on me, I think,”
the business manager told the
E.C.

Gray Coleman, editor of the
Ring-tum Phi, estimated that
last year,s newspaper lost
“about $1,400.’’ He attributed
the deficit to a ‘massive adver-
tising loss.”’

“Things look a whole lot bet-
ter for ads this year,’’ Coleman
assured the E.C. ‘‘The advertis-
ing staff is bigger than I’ve ever
seen it.”

Both the Calyx’s and Ring-
tum Phi’s debts were paid for
out of the Publications Board
reserve fund.

“We are going to start en-
couraging people to live within
their means,’, Dudley said.

The SAB’s $1,700 deficit from
last year was explained to be 2
result of checks written during
an “interim period” when the
original treasurer, Jim
Foreman, quit and the new
treasurer took over. The checks
written during that time were
never recorded, even though
one amounted to $1,600.

‘I don’t think we need to cry
too much longer over spilled
milk,” Dudley said. “‘We can

IFC hopes to change

noise ordinance

(continued trom page 1)
fraternity did not like the fact
that there was no. definite
agreement of cooperation from
the police. He advocated put-
ting ‘‘pressure on the townspeo-
ple’ by boycotting Lexington.
In response to his arguement,
Dean Murphy said that “‘if you
try to fight this pressure with
your own pressure, I think
you’re going to lose.”’

Dudley pointed out that
fraternity members are break-
ing the law as it now stands, and
should they try pressure tac-
tics, the police would only crack
down harder.

Reasons for the ‘‘crackdown”’

Dudley explained that the
reasons for the recent
crackdown on noise violations

are that “two things have
changed: parties have started
later’ and that ‘Kirby has
taken a different approach to
the problem than his
predecessors.”’

The fraternities are not yet
bound by the list of their conces-
sions to the town, so the IFC is
asking the fraternities to try
and keep the noise down after 11
p.m.

According to Davis, the police
were very cooperative this
weekend and there were no ar-
rests. He hopes that the situa-
tion will remain this way.

“Things are going well,”
Davis said. ‘‘No problems have
interferred with an agreement
being reached between the
police and the students.”’

One final note, for diehard

Other business

In other action at Monday
night’s E.C. meeting, both the
E.C. and the SAB declined to
contribute to the Student Bar
Association’s (SBA) function
Oct. 7.

The SBA has hired a band to
perform at the Pavillion for the
purpose of building better rela-
tions between W&L’s
undergraduate and law schools.
They hoped that either the E.C.
or the SAB would supply beer.

I’m not so sure the E.C.
should get into the SAB's
business of providing entertain-
ment,’’ Dudley said. ‘I don't
think the E.C. should subsidize
parties,’’ the student body

president continued.

The E.C. voted 5-4 in favor of
a motion “‘not to contribute to
the SBA function on the 7th.”

Hank Hall said that the SBA’s
plans ‘‘came up all of a sudden”
and fell too close to Homecom-
ing weekend for the SAB to act.
He noted that the SAB was
already planning a beer party
Oct. 13, before the scheduled
concert ‘“‘to give people a
chance to get inebriated.”’

The SAB also declined to help
finance the SBA’s party.

NUMBER3

E.C. Allocates *75,000 in Student Funds

by Randy Smith

The Executive Committee
distributed $75,000 to various
student committees at a five
hour budget session Tuesday
night.

The money is derived from
the $45 student tax each
Washington and Lee student
pays for the purpose of funding
recognized student groups and
organizations that provide ser-
vices for the student body.

The Student Activities Board
(SAB), which provides enter-
tainment on campus, received
the largest proportion, $30,910-
an increase of $1,560 over the
amount they were allotted last
year.

Capturing the second largest
amount of the student tax was
the Student Bar Association
(SBA), which represents W&L’s
law students and their varied
activities. The SBA was
allocated $13,358--an increase of
$3,298 over last year.

The organization realizing the
most dramatic increase in fun-
ding over last year was Ariel,
the student literary magazine,
which received $2,100 Tuesday
night as opposed to the $950
granted the previous year.

E.C, accounts

Of primary concern to the
E.C. was raising the level of the
Student Body Reserve Fund
above the $1,990 figure it reach-
ed after paying for the SAB’s
summer deficit. The student
body constitution sets a limit of
$2,500 as the minimum for that
account, which is set aside for
“emergencies.”

‘The Reserve Fund should be
at least $6,000,”’ E.C. president
Beau Dudley said in a
preliminary budget hearing.
The E.C. had $8,000 more in
funds this year because of a $5
increase in the student tax,
primarily to augment the
Reserve Fund.

Following Dudley’s line of
thinking, the committee deter-
mined that $4,100 be added to
the Reserve Fund account to
bring the total up to $6,090.

The E.C.’s own Operating
Budget was slated to be
$2,033.24. That figure was
reduced by the committee by
eliminating three of the four

. telephones that had been in the

four E.C. offices. The savings
realized from this cut allowed
the E.C. to reduce its Operating
Budget to $1,900.

“I look very dimly on any

group that knows they will want
money this year and did not
submit a budget to this commit-
tee for consideration tonight,”’
Dudley said

“It seems to me that we
should cut substantially from
the E.C. Funding account and
tell these groups that the money

. will not be available this year,”’

the student body president con-
tinued.

Student Files Complaint
Against Police Officer

by David Greer

Washington and Lee senior
Bill Tucker has filed a com-
plaint against Lexington Chief
of Police James A. Kirby and
Officer Jack Purvis. The com-
plaint stems from the conduct
of Purvis and Kirby following
Purvis’ arrest of Tucker for
driving under the influence of
alcohol and speeding on the
morning of Aug. 31.

In his letter to Kirby, Tucker
states, ‘“‘The source of my com-
plaint centers on _ two
things...the actions and at-
titudes of _ Officer Purvis
and...the timing of my being
charged with speeding and
Dui”

Tucker adds that he is “not

looking for anything to come of
this,” but is filing ‘‘to enable
Police Chief Kirby’s office to in-
vestigate the matter to its
satisfaction.”

On the morning of Aug. 31,
Tucker was returning from a
poker game around 2:45 a.m.
He parked beside Graham-Lee
dorm. Purvis had followed him
to the parking lot and claimed,
according to Tucker, that he
had been speeding and that his
car “left the ground at Main
Street.”’

Purvis said that he suspected
Tucker was intoxicated when
Tucker fumbled while remov-
ing his driver’s license from his

wallet. Tucker claims that the

plastic on his license is torn and
therefore he had _ difficulty
removing it.

Purvis made Tucker take a
sobriety test which Tucker felt
he passed to Purvis’ satisfac-
tion. However, Purvis said that
Tucker could hardly pass it.
Purvis intended to let Tucker
off without a ticket and lectured
him about safe driving.

Before Purvis left, Tucker
asked him, “Officer Purvis,
why do you stop me so much
and particularly why do you

, Stop Texans?’ According to

   

photo by Parker Roberts

Tucker, Purvis’ “temperament
altered noticeably and he
charged me with speeding at 41
miles an hour” in a 25 mph
zone. Tucker claims that his
speed was not visible on the
radar screen, but Purvis
testified in court that he showed
the radar to Tucker and said in
an interview that he always
does this.

Tucker said he wanted
answers to a few questions
before he signed the ticket, but
Purvis, instead of giving
answers, arrested Tucker and
took him to the police station
(without reading him his
rights) Tucker kept asking

(continued on page’9) '

The committee set the E.C.
Funding account at $2,132, a
reduction of $1,468 from last
year, because they do not an-
ticipate any requests during the
year from established groups
on campus that did not submit a
budget for approval Tuesday.

Other student committee
budgets had to be cut to acheive
the $75,000 figure the E.C. was
given to work with (which was
based on a total number of
17,012 students attending W&L).

SAB budget slashed

The SAB’s original request
was for $35,732. This figure was
quickly reduced by _ co-
chairman Hank Hall to $34,310
before E.C. questioning began
by reducing the calculated ex-
penses for this year’s films
from $4,672 to $3,600 and by
eliminating the $350 allotted for
attending the National Enter-
tainment Conference. The SAB

Phi Delt,

will not send a representative to
the conference this year.

Bill Tucker, vice-president of
the E.C. and former SAB chair-
man, questioned the commit-
tee’s estimated $7,000 loss on
the Fancy Dress Ball. That
figure was reduced to $5,000.

“You have $3,600 budgeted
for films and films are basically
a break-even business,’’ said
Rob Calvert, senior represen-
tative, also a former member of
the SAB.

Hall explained that the SAB
did not “expect to break even”
on films this year because they
plan to show more recent
movies, which cost more to ob-
tain.

Unconvinced, the E.C. fur-
ther reduced the total film
budget to $2,200 for the year.
And when the smoke had
cleared, the SAB was left with

$30,910--$4,822 less than the

Phi Kap

cited for noise
violations Sunday

by Charles Tucker

Phi Delta Theta President
Syd Farrar and Jim Welch, a
member of Phi Kappa Sigma
fraternity, were each issued a
summons for violations of the
Lexington city noise ordinance
last Sunday morning.

While Farrar was
unavailable for comment, other
members of Phi Delt maintain-
ed that the noise level was kept
at a minimum and that their
band music could not be heard
on the street. One member
speculated that the police were
attracted due to noise made by
persons on the sidewalk outside
the house. The police arrived at

approximately 1:30 a.m., ac-
cording to members of the
fraternity.

Thirty minutes later Jim
Welch of Phi Kappa Sigma was
taken to the police station and
issued a summons by Lexington
Police Officer Purvis. Welch,
who says he will plead not guilty
to the charge of breaking the
statute, reportedly placed a
stereo speaker in a window fac-
ing out of the fraternity house
and onto Jefferson Street. The
Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity
was not charged.

Welch stated that he was

figure they had submitted to the
E.C.

SBA gets 85 percent

The Student Bar Association
requested that the E.C. return
to them 90 percent of the tax col-
lected from W&L’s 344 law
students ($13,932) in a “‘very
detailed” budget outlining how
money would be used.

Last year, the SBA received
85 percent of the tax paid by
each law student.

The SBA budget report listed
six reasons justifying their re-
quest, among them “‘inflation,”’
an $890 ‘deficit at Washington
Hall,”’ and ‘“‘unique’”’ law stu-
dent ‘‘needs.”’

“Since law students have
their own neeas apart from that
of other members of the W&L
community, we feel the SBA is
the group to best meet these
unique attributes of law
students; same as
undergraduate organizations
can best determine how to serve
their constituency, we feel the
SBA has its hand on the pulse of
the law school, and can best
determine how to allocate the
activity fees of law students,”
the budget summary stated.

Many E.C. members were
‘“‘troubled’’ by the SBA’s
reasoning.

Beau Dudley, himself a law
student, asked the SBA to look
at the ‘“‘other side of the coin.
What percentage of SBA funds
should be kept here for Contact
speakers and things like Fancy
Dress? Certainly it seems to us
(the E.C.) that 15 percent is at
least a minimum of what law
students should contribute to
this side of the bridge.”’

‘‘How can you measure this
(the percentage of funds actual-
ly utilized by law students at-
tending undergraduate func-
tions),’’ responded John
Allevato, treasurer of the SBA.
‘Taw students are a little dif-
ferent and we (the SBA) are
best suited to meet their
needs.”’

Tom McCarthy, secretary of
the E.C., called the situation
between W&L’s law and
undergraduate schools a “‘one-

way street,’’ where
undergraduates do not have ac-
cess to all law school activities.

To his criticism, SBA presi-
dent Kevin Cosgrove gave his
assurance that ‘‘there will be
more publicity and _ better
publicity than there was last
year.”

‘Well, I think there’s enough
fat to be trimmed from parts of
their budget that a 5 percent cut
wouldn’t hurt,’’ said Dudley.

Will Mackie, E.C. sophomore
representa‘ ive, said, “I feel the
85 percent figure is a good
amount and will achieve our
end of saving money without
hurting them (the SBA).”’

The motion finally approved
by the E.C. granted the SBA 85
percent of the tax on law
students ($13,158) and $200 to
“offset the debt to Washington
Hall.”’

Contact receives $400 increase

Although the Contact commit-
tee did not receive the full
$7,532.77 it requested of the
E.C., the committee was given
$6,500-—-$400 more than last year.

Tom Salley, co-chairman of
Contact, said that his commit-
tee had hoped to bring six
speakers to campus this year
instead of five, which was the
basis of Contact’s request of
$1,432.77 more than was granted
last year.

“I think it would be unfair to
other groups to authorize an in-
crease of this kind,’’ Dudley
said. ‘It would be a little bit
tough to justify an increase
when we are asking other
groups to make cuts,” the stu-
dent body president continued.

This motion (for $6,500) is the
best we can do and we hope
you'll do your best with it,”
Dudley said.

Ariel to expand

Ariel editor Ben Keesee
presented the E.C. with a $2,866
budget request. The budget in-
cluded the price for three
issues, one with color
photography (in the past, Ariel
has only published two issues a
year in black and white).

Several E.C. members
recommended that Ariel look
into subscriptions, patron

advertising, or other forms of
“‘selfgenerating revenue.’’

“If it takes selling advertising
to put out a quality magazine,

then I am not against doing
that,” Keesee said. He added
that he as editor wants to
“establish Ariel and give it the
potential for growth.”’

Many E.C. members said that
they had been impressed with
the “strides” the literary
magazine has taken recently,
and $2,100 was appropriated.

Ring-tum Phi gets $4,750

Ring-tum Phi Business
Manager Peter Goss told the
E.C. that advertising revenue
for this year’s paper was ex-
pected to increase $2,100 over
last year, and that he an-
ticipated subscriptions to dou-
ble.

‘This year we have the abili-
ty to both increase the size and
the quality of the newspaper,”
Goss said. ‘‘Any proposed cut
you make this evening would
deprive the W&L student body
of the type of paper they
deserve.”’

Editor-in-chief Gray Coleman
noted that the current staff of
the Ring-tum Phi numbered
“between 43 and 45 people’’
which is ‘‘double the staff of last
year.”

Although he agreed that the
overall quality of the
newspaper had improved,
junior E.C. representative
Steve Abraham said that the
newspaper’s staff should ‘‘be
receptive to the problems we
are having”’ meeting the $75,000
limit.

Beau Dudley urged fewer big
issues, 16-20 pages in length.

In the end, the E.C. voted to
appropriate $4,750 to the
Ringtum Phi’s budget, $535.36
less than requested, but $1,850
more than the newspaper
received last year.

Calyx holding down costs

Grant Leister, business
manager of -the Calyx,
presented a budget for the year-
book which will be substantially
the same as last year’s, but will
cost $1,247 less.

He did request, however, that
the student tax contribution in-
crease $1,011 over last year,
raising the percentage of the
book financed by student funds
by almost 10

another way, Bob Willis, E.C.

Fancy Dress Ticeuns Discussed

by Dick Moss
and Jim Hicks

During the Fancy Dress open
discussion, held in the SAB of-
fice during the regular SAB
meeting, Doug Jackson releas-
ed a tentative list of Fancy
Dress themes for general con-
sideration. That list of themes
included: Fifties, Beach,
Oktoberfest, Colonial America,
Twenties, Las Vegas, Old
South, Star Wars, Orient, New
York City, and the Old West.
Any student who wishes to
make any other suggestions, or
express his opinion of the
themes listed above, is en-
couraged to contact the SAB of-
fice, or any SAB member.

The SAB also announced that
a meeting would be held this

Thursday in the EC room at
4:30 to discuss the University
Council’s suggestion that Fancy
Dress be held within
Washington’s birthday break.

In other major matters before
the SAB, the SAB announced
that Al Gordon has agreed to let
them use duPont auditorium for
their movies this year, on the
condition that no food or drinks
(including alcoholic beverages)
will be allowed in the
auditorium. The SAB also
stated that it would be a student
control offense if any violation
of this condition is found, and all
violators of this rule shall be
referred to the Student Control
Committee. Regulations con-
cerning the use of the
auditorium will be posted out-
side the auditorium by the SAB.

 

student budgets set

(continued from page 2)

gested that fraternities and
organizations be charged $50
more this year for their pages in
the yearbook.

The E.C. voted to appropriate
$9,150 to the Calyx--$861.50 less
than was originally requested,
but $150 more than the publica-
tion received last year.

Smaller clubs

The English Club, formed last
spring, was given $100 of the
$375 requested to sponsor three
speakers from ‘fairly near-by
schools,” according to Parker
Potter, spokesman for the
group.

“T think it’s a good sign to see"

people excited about doing
something culturally oriented,”’
said Bob Willis.

Junior representative Steve
Abraham said that the club
should “have to prove’ that
they were “going to be around
longer than one month.”

“It’s not whether you go
defunct and never operate,”’ ad-

ded John Murphy, the third
year law school representative
on the E.C., “it’s whether you
will operate and get more than
ten people to participate.”

A majority of the E.C. felt,
however, that the English Club
was “worthy enough of a small
investment to see where they
go.”

The E.C. was not willing to
grant the request for $200 to the
Soccer Club to help finance the
Second Annual Liberty Hall In-
door Soccer Tournament.
Dudley suggested that the club
raise revenue by charging an
entrance fee to the tournament
participants or by “‘nitiating
projects on their own.”’

The Pre-Law Society had
originally requested $350, but
president Chip Welch told the
E.C. that his group was “not
asking for anything right now,”’
but might need financial
assistance in the future if they
brought a “big” speaker to
campus.

It is now the responsibility of
the student body to abide by
these guidelines and to main-
tain the trust between the SAB
and the fine arts department. If

the SAB is again asked to leave -

duPont auditorium, the student
body will be without a suitable
location for the weekend films,

and this may result in the
cancellation of the weekend
film series.

The first SAB film this fall
will be Mother, Jugs, and
Speed, a fast-pased comedy
with Bill Cosby and Raquel
Welch. The film will be shown
at 7 and 9 p.m. this Friday,
Saturday and Sunday in duPont
auditorium. There will be an ad-
mission charge of $1. Also, any
person interested in showing
the weekend films and earning
a few dolars should contact one
of the SAB film co-chairmen,
Danny Raskin (463-4089) or Jim
Hicks (463-7855).

at 2:20 a.m., and he and Officer
Purvis sat in the patrol car and
talked. Among the topics
discussed was “the music
which was still blaring from the
Phi Delt house down the
street.”

Interfraternity Council

In a meeting Tuesday night
the Phi Delt arrest was men-
tioned as well as the fact that
the police received six or seven
other complaints. The Phi Kap
arrest was not mentioned
because IFC chairman Jim
Davis felt that the violation was
not in connection with a frater-
nity function.

Davis stressed that it is im-
portant that fraternities keep
within the guidelines prescribed
in the list of concessions
presented to City Council as no
decision has been reached and
it will be “‘ a week or so before
anything positive comes up.”
He added that any fraternity
receiving a summons will have
to appear before the IFC
Judicial Board.

Davis said that he, Student
Body President Beau Dudley,
and Asst. Dean of Students Dan
Murphy will meet Wednesday
with Dr. Thomas C. Imeson, a
professor at W&L. Imeson is the
chairman of the City Council’s
Committee on Public Safety, to
which the matter has been
referred.

Davis said that to get exemp-
tions from the noise ordinance

on weekends and the Thursday
nights before the three big
weekends the City Council will
have to take action. He said that
Police Chief James A. Kirby
could advise police officers as
to a policy of requiring com-
plaints or giving a warning
before issuing summonses. He
added that the fraternities want
positive determination of noise
levels in violation with the
policy.

Davis suggested that perhaps
police would adopt a plan
similar to the- one used at
University of Virginia in deter-
mining violations. At U.Va., the
police have a decibel meter and
‘stand at the complaintant’s pro-
perty line; if the meter
registers above a predetermin-
ed level, the fraternity is sub-
ject to legal action.

In other IFC business, the
Judicial Board fined Sigma Nu
$75 for putting posters in a
freshmen area advertising a
party. Also, the following
fraternities were fined $10 for
not paying Coach Vern Canfield
for lawn maintenance over the
summer: Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
Sigma Nu, Zeta Beta Tau, Delta
Tau Delta, and Pi Kappa Phi.

Rush Chairman Chris Volk
said that houses must pick up
freshmen signed up for rush
dates or face a $20 fine for each
one not picked up. He added
that dorm rush will be held Fri-
day from 3 to5.

Informality marks
Khune’s work

by Don Noble

W&L was fortunate enough to
have been visited last week by
the artist whose works are cur-
rently being exhibited in duPont
Gallery. Dan Khune, who is an
assistant professor of art at
Anne Arundel Community Col-
lege in Maryland, spoke to
several of the art classes. He
explained his paintings and
talked about his approach to
art, which added an extra
dimension to the show.

Kuhne’s approach to the basic
elements of art is fairly in-
formal. He believes that too
much emphasis on color, line,
and other elements can make
the artist too self-conscious and
thereby lose the emotional
quality in the work. Art should
be more spontaneous, not so
calculated and formalistic.

He is especially vocal about
style, and insists that, ‘‘there’s
too much emphasis on style.
That’s something I try not to
think about. A good artist
should try different styles and
always try to do something new.
I tried many ways of painting
before I found where I should
be. I’m an eclectic; I borrow
many styles.”

Kuhne describes his paintings
as, “having to do with that
magical moment when I am one
with the universe.’’ He believes
that his work is akin to the im-
pressionists, and there is a cer-
tain Van Gogh quality in
several of them.

Kuhne does not like minimal
art, which is too basic. He calls
himself a maximal artist; the
more he puts into the painting
the better it is. This achieves a
richness of variety, which can
be seen in the complexity of
vivid colors and strokes. He
compares painting to a sym-
phony, where the brushes are
like different instruments and
the strokes they make like dif-
ferent sounds, all of which come
together to make the work com-
plete, as in his ‘Opera of Spr-

ing.
Kuhne believes that, ‘‘the
most important thing about art

is the content—the spiritual
quality in it. I try to trigger

many kinds of imagery in my ©

work. I paint with all my senses
- a tree should dance in spring,
feel frozen in winter, and look
frightened in a storm.”

Indeed in his painting of a
storm the trees suggest lightn-

 

edaeeorvetp|eeetee

ing and movement. ‘‘You’re
looking in your mind’s eye at
the dream of a tree,’’ said
Kuhne, who also enjoys visual
puns. In his painting ‘Night
time of the Spring Day’’ the
windows and curtains are
meant to suggest an Arab;s
head, while many of the trees
suggest human arms and
hands.

It is especially interesting to
be able to see Kuhne’s
preliminary drawings with the
paintings. These are what he
uses to plan out his paintings.
“Drawings are like X-rays for a
doctor. They are able to capture
something quickly. My drawing
is the vehicle of my meditation.
They should have order, but
also freedom in the order. They
should not be like a

‘photograph.”’

One thing that may be sur-
prising to the viewer is the way
Kuhne does not paint the entire
canvas. He says, “I want my
paintings to be as fresh and
spontaneous as drawings, thus I
didn’t see a need to paint the
whole canvas.”

Kuhne’s paintings do have
this feeling of freshness and
spontaneity. They suggest a
certain power and emotion
which he spoke of. In any event,
it is worth a trip to duPont
Gallery to get an impression of
what he is trying to accomplish
and say in his work.

Poet presents modern view

The poet John Morris will read from his
work on Wednesday, Oct. 4, in Payne 21. Mor-

ris is a graduate of Hamilton College and Col- .

umbia University, and presently teaches
eighteenth-century English literature at
Washington University in St. Louis. He has
published two books of poetry Green Business
and The Life Besides This one, and a critical
study Versions of the Self: Studies in English
Autobiography.

Morris’s poetry deals evocatively, yet not
despairingly with the concerns of modern
man; the isolation of the self, the world’ indif-
ference to the sufferings and doubts of the in-
dividual, and the endless and empty repeti-
tion of human life. Unlike many conte orary
confessional poets, Morris refuses to indulge
in self- pitying laments; rather he reflects on
life with a wry humor which enables us to
laugh or at least smile at the pain he reveals.

Although he aliudes to writers like Blake,
Thoreau, Twain, and Williams, Morris re-
mains highly personal and unpretentious. In
“Between Two Bells” Morris stands in a park

4

ptt
Pei teat ete

  
   

hibition

in Japan and listens to the bells of a Buddhist
temple and a Catholic church ringing
simultaneously, yet he refuses to make it into
a metaphor.

I do no want to pretend that this was a moment of
conclusions.

No. It was a moment of standing between the
ringing of two bells.

Inconclusive conclusions are modern man’s
lot according to Morris. He calls to his unborn
son to emerge to a world of suffering and
death:

Fall out of the natural into what small
Deeds you will live in, where,
Whatever you carry in your body to die of and
Whether you go out like a coward or
Aman hanged for the wrong reason,
Screaming with cancer or inch
By bright inch under the knife,
Like us you shall conceive death.
("To an Unborn”)

Besides those dealing with the grim aspects
of life, Morris writes amusing poems, many
of which deal with University life. ‘What the
Professor Said” is a humorous description of
the distance separating the pedagogue and
the pupil. ‘“‘Couch Hour’’ summarizes the ex-
perience of psychoanalysis in seven lines.

A history, a bag of pains,
Interesting only to himself

And not always that,

A mistake no one’s to blame for,
He repeats his errors,

The lesson he knows by heart,
And never learns.

Morris’s wry humor is‘ never clearer than
when he writes of himself. He knows himself
painfully well, and is willing to share himself
with us, without asking for sympathy.
Arthritic, perhaps, and as terrified as now
Of cancer, impatient of the doctor's restraints,

As I potter and mumble in my daughter's garden

I shall go out, despite my salt-free diet,

Full of bourbon and my old complaints.
("Thirty-Seven”)

Morris’s reading will be followed by a wine
and cheese reception in the English seminar
room sponsored by the English department
and the English Club.

Tom Helscher

“what’s sterile, depressing,
etc., in today’s mores’’ assumes
an entertaining and
sophisticated tone. Through
most of the play, somewhat
longer that one-act in length,
Gray maintains this tone:
quick, sharp, and often less
than kind. In the end, it seems
all to have been rather flip and
shabby, as we realize with a
shock that the humor has in-
sulated us from the
playwright’s seriousness quite
as effectively as the major
character has used liquor, sex,

and the standard electronic con-—

veniences to lessen his unplea-
sant confrontation with reali-
ty’s demands.

John Jacobsen ’79, the direc-
tor, has announced open audi-
tions for five male roles and two
female roles. The auditions will
be conducted this evening and
tomorrow evening, from 7 until
8:30, at the Troubadour
Theatre. Anyone interested in
reading for a part is invited to
attend.

W&L grad

Scott Ainslie, a 1974 graduate
of W&L, will return to campus
tonight, for a performance in
the Cockpit. Since he
graduated, Scott has been very
active in various musical
undertakings. He toured Great
Britain and Ireland for two
years, performing for the
British Arts Council, perform-
ing on the public television sta-
tion, the B.B.C. and performing
in various coffee houses
throughout the nation. All of
this was funded by the United
States Information Service:

Since his return to the States,
he has toured the Southeast,
and performed on many public
radio stations in North
Carolina. Primarily a folk ar-
tist, Scott combines British,
Gaelic, and American folk
heritages on his fiddles and ban-
jos.

His show will begin around
7:30, and there will be absolute-
ly no cover charge to anyone.

Power in the Darkness
Tom Robinson Band
Harvest STB-11778

To- paraphrase Jon Landau
(and to risk, no doubt, the same
sort of scorn and ridicule he
received in writing about Bruce
Springsteen), I have seen the
future of rock and roll and it is
the Tom Robinson Band. A little
premature for a band that’s on-
ly released one album? Maybe.
The fact is that I haven’t heard
a better record this year from
any group, much less a new
band.

From the opening chords of
“Up Against the Wall,’’ Power
in the Darkness grabs hold of
the listener and just won’t let
go. Sure, TRB can rock, but so
can a lot of bands. What makes
these guys different? Simply
this: they write songs the likes
of which have been seldom
heard since the old ‘British In-
vasion”’ days. This stuff would
sound good even if Aerosmith
was playing it. Power in the
Darkness contains all original
material, save one song, and
very little can be considered
“filler”? (unusual for a double
album). Outstanding rockers
include the above-mentioned
“Up Against the Wall,’’ ‘Don’t
Take No For An Answer,”
“Ain’t Gonna Take it,’’ and
“Right On Sister.” But TRB
doesn’t play just rock and roll—
some of the album’s best tracks
are on the lighter side, in-
cluding the low-key ‘‘To Good
To Be True,” a moving version
of Dylan’s ‘I Shall Be Releas-
ed,”’ and the very pop-oriented
‘‘2-4-6-8-Motorway” (a British
hit single for TRB).

In short, the Tom Robinson
Band has the songwriting
abilities and instrumental
talent to make it big worldwide.
I see only two things that might
hold them back—both related to
their image, not their music.
First, because they’re new and
British, they may be dismissed
in some. quarters as ‘“‘just
another New Wave band.” It is
true that TRB is an angry bunch
of musicians. The group’s sym-
bol is an upraised, clenched fist,
and when Tom Robinson sings
“we ain’t gonna take it!,’’ you
know he’s not kidding. But TRB
proves that there’s more to
“New Wave’’ than three-chord

rock ‘n roll—when they do ex-
press their frustrations in song
it’s more than pounding guitars
and demented screaming.
Listen to the record; the songs
will stand on their own.

The second possible barrier to
TRB’s success is their release
of a song (included on Power in
the Darkness) called ‘‘Glad To
Be Gay.”’ It’s a good enough
song, actually, but is has (a) of-
fended a few people and more
importantly (b), caused many
potential Tom Robinson fans to
dismiss them as_ another
“curiosity” group, with no real
talent to back them up. Those
who do so are missing a tremen-
dous debut album by a very pro-
mising new band. Power in the
Darkness promises to be one of
the best of ’78; if you buy one
record all year, let this be it.

AN
TOM ROBINSON BAND

Eye And Ear:

From the tidal wave of
enrollments which deluged the
English Department this fall it
seems clear that students have
gotten the message. Their
elders have been proclaiming
with vehemence that young peo-
ple are singularly inept in the
use of their own language.
While being given credit for ad-
ding some vivid words to the
American language, the arriv-
ing generation has been receiv-
ed in recent years with much
headshaking, hand-wringing
and even despair. No
knowledge of sentence-
structure, an unawareness of
such often humorous gaffes as
dangling participles and misus-
ed pronouns. Horrors!

English grammar is not hard
to learn — it makes sense to us.
At least it doesn’t have the verb
placed a mile or so along the

sentence as another language
does. Yet once the basics of bor-
ing routine in_ subjects,
predicates and other oddments
have been digested there comes
the problem of words
themselves. It’s no good know-
ing the structure if you have
nothing much to hang on it.
Often, in the Bookstore we
have requests for books on how
to increase a vocabulary by the
end of next week. Well, ten
years ago would have been a
better time to start, by reading
and more reading. (Incidental-
ly, there are words which I’ve
refused to look up for years, —
such as pejorative, symbiosis,
entropy and moot. However,
I’ve discovered that one of
them, symbiosis, is a great one,
with romantic echoes yet.)
‘There are some _ favorite
short-cuts of mine which I offer

 

for what they are worth. Doing
crossword puzzles. You have to
wrack your mind and surpris-
ing words pop out of your head.
The definitions and stray letters
give leads which help fill in the
empty spaces. Winning is plea-
sant.

The very best help is a
thesaurus (a book containing a
store of words, says Webster’s
International Dictionary.)
There are thesauruses in dic-
tionary form — really just
synonyms — and also in the
more complicated standard
volume. Once you’ve figured
out the latter method it can
widen one’s verbal horizons in
short and lovely order.

And then there are puns. Here
both the eye and ear are put into
play; sense cross-matched with

sound to delight and .appall, .

Coming Home
Hits Home

by Dick Barron

Many of the movie offerings
of the past year have been big
scale productions with flashy
hollywood approaches (Star
Wars, Grease, and Sgt. Pep-
per’s, to name a few). Even
small budget films have, to a
large extent attempted to ap-
peal to the public thirst for
thrills, bigger stars,
louder auto wrecks, and longer
cop chases. An obvious depar-
ture from this trend is Coming
Home,which takes three well-
known stars — Jon Voight, Jane
Fonda, and Bruce Dern — and
places them in serious roles in
an attempt to probe a serious
problem, the Vietnam war.

As memories of the Vietnam
war begin to sink slowly in our
minds, along comes a movie
that brings them back to us in a
personal way. Coming Home is
an anti-war film, but instead of
being shot on the battlefield, the
action is shot almost entirely in
the hospitals and houses of
hometown America.

Assistant basket ball

coach named

Washington and Lee announc-
ed on Tuesday the appointment
of a new assistant basketball
coach.

James P. ‘Jim’ Casciano,
a 1975 graduate of Drexel
University, was named assis-
tant basketball coach by head-

basketball coach Verne Can--

field. Casciano was hired under
a new internship program the
University is instituting this
season, Canfield said.

Casciano was a_ graduate
assistant coach at the Universi-
ty of Delaware last season.
He was part time assistant at
Villanova University during the
1976-77 season. In 1975-76, Cas-
ciano served as freshman coach
and assistant varsity coach at
St. Joseph’s School in
Philadelphia.

Casciano was captain of
Drexel’s 1970-71 freshman
team. While attending Bishop

W&L goes to Centre College
and lose - host Macon Sat.

by Bill Whalen

The Washington & Lee
Generals visited the Centre Col-
onels last Saturday and came
away with a 20-6 loss. The
Generals, now 0-3 on the season,
find themselves in a must win
situation if they are to salvage
any of the rest of the season.
This Saturday’s opponent,
Randolph-Macon College, pro-
mises not only to be a tough
game but also marks the open-
ing.of the General’s Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference.

While his team is off to a
miserable start, Coach Gary
Fallon remains quietly confi-
dent. ‘“‘We like to take each
game separately’’, said Fallon.
“Our defense has improved
with each game but our main
problem has been our offense’s
inconsistency.”

This was never as apparent
as last Saturday when the
General’s offense committed
seven turnovers, including
three fumbles and four in-
terceptions and could put
together only one scoring drive.
“Our offense has been playing
catch-up ball in every game,”
cited Fallon, ‘“‘Which puts a real
burden on the players.”

Against Centre, the Generals
reversed their usual second half
slide by falling way behind ear-
ly in the game. The Colonel’s
first touchdown came after
recovering a fumble on the
W&L three Mike Shannon’s 59
yard run gave Centre their se-
cond touchdown and a 14-0 lead
in the second quarter. A nine-
play, 70 yard drive accounted
for CC’s final touchdown, with
the score coming on a 20 yard
pass from John Quillin to John
Clontz. The Generals trailed
20-0 at the half. ‘‘We still felt we
were in the game, even though
we were behind 20-0,’’ said
Fallon. ‘The defense had been

  

playing well, (only 187 yards
allowed) and we made some of-
fensive adjustments.’’ One of
those adjustments was replac-
ing quarterback Scott Swope
with Chris Leiser.

Defensively, the Generals
played a perfect second half.
They held Centre to only two
first downs and 34 yards in the
last two quarters. More im-
portantly, it was the first time
this year that the Generals have
not collapsed in the second half.
“‘Now they can’t call us a two
quarter football team,’ said
Fallon. ‘If we can put together
sixty minutes of good football
then we'll do all right.”

At this point, however,
Fallon’s team lacks “‘offensive
consistency” and the offense
will have to improve for the
Generals to win, win. ‘“‘We’re
looking for the right quarter-

 

back, and whoever has the best

week in practice will start on:

Saturday,’ said Fallon.

Another key to the General’s:

fate will be the availability of
running back Stewart Atkinson,
whose ankle injury makes him
a probable starter for Satur-
day’s game.

‘*Randolph-Macon’s
strength,” according to Fallon,
‘lies in their strong-suit
defense,”’ which is a 5-2 align-
ment. ‘We'll try to mix-up our
plays to keep them off-balance,
but mainly we want control’ to
control the ball and keep our
defense rested.”

W&L is the underdog in this
game. R-MC is 0-2 but is
predicted to be the strongest
team in the conference aside
from defending champ
Hampden-Sydney. Game time
is 1:30 at Wilson Field.

Soccer team to play ist ODAC
meet after tying Valley United

by Tim Connors

Washington and Lee played
the Valley United Soccer Club
of Roanoke in an exhibition
game last Saturday, and the
two teams battled to a 2-2 tie in
overtime.

Coach Rolf Piranian felt that
the Generals played much bet-
ter this week than in previous
games, and he feels that
“things are finally falling into
place.’”’ W&L_ completely
dominated the game offensive-
ly, taking 44 shots as opposed to
Valley’s 16. The Generals could
not capitalize on _ these
numerous scoring chances,
however, and Piranian feels
that his team must ‘“‘put things
together by better following the
principles ofthe game.”

Todd Tyson opened the scor-
ing for W&L in the first period,
his goal being set up on a pass
from Bryan Williams. A defen-
sive lapse by W&L allowed
Valley to go ahead 2-1 entering
the fourth period, but the
Generals were determined not
to let the game end there. Pira-
nian was proud of the way in

which his team ‘‘never gave
up,” and how Williams came
back with a ‘‘super effort”’ on a
fine individual move, scoring
the goal which sent the game in-
to overtime.

The overtime was dominated
by the W&L offense, with Billy
Brown booming a shot on which
the V.U. goalie had to make a
spectacular save to prevent a
score. Kevin Carney, not to be
outdone in the nets by his oppo-
nent, came up with another

super effort in the second over-
time period to preserve the tie.
As Piranian put it, it was ‘“‘a
question of inches” as to
whether either team would
score, but outstanding  in-
dividual performances nullified
both teams’ chances.

W&L plays host to East Men-
nonite College on Saturday in its
first Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference contest, and Piranian
feels that now ‘‘the pressure is
on.”’

Course error ruins
first c-c attempt

by Greg Branan

The Washington and Lee
cross country team began this
year’s season on a controversial
note in last Saturday’s meet at
Davis and Elkins College in
West Virginia.

The Generals were shown the
five mile course in the morning.
At the start of the race,
however, verbal instructions

about the course were given
which .differed with what had
been shown. This new course in-
volved more hills than had been
mentioned before. In addition,
not all the changes were
discussed. Halfway through the
race, D&E’s runners ran a
course that was considerably
shorter than had been shown to

Tennis team readies
for fall tourney

‘ by John Winans

The Washington and Lee ten-
nis team made a fair showing
last week at the Navy Fall In-
vitational Tournament, which
was packed with collegiate ten-
nis powerhouses.

Coach Gary Franke chose
Stewart Jackson, Shaw Cran-
field, David Constine, West
Yonge, Pat Morris, Sumner
Boulding, Nat Lovell, Peter
Williams, R. Dan Huebner and
Peter Eliades to make the trip
to Annapolis, Md. ‘‘This was a
top-flight tournament with
some excellent teams and good

athletes. Considering the
amount of practice we’ve had,
we did well,” Franke explained.

The next tennis tournament is
at James Madison this
weekend. Along with W&L and
the Dukes will be Hampden-
Sydney and the University of
Richmond. Franke has already
decided that Jackson, Cran-
field, Constine, Yonge and Nor-
ris will be making the trip to
Harrisonburg and this week he
will decide who will fill the
other two or three slots.

These two tournaments lead
to the Second Annual Fall In-

vitational here at W&L on
Homecoming weekend. ‘We

have to work hard in practice :

this week, get some breaks and
we'll be right at the top this
weekend,” predicted Franke.

- Britons take on the
“Colonies” in W&L debate

Some things in life never
change. The British, who have
been unable to keep from in-
terfering in American politics
for three hundred years, are at
it again.

First it was King George they
wanted to inflict on us. Now it’s
another term for Jimmy
Carter.

It seems a team of debaters
from Cambridge University is
going to visit Washington and
Lee University next week to
argue the question ‘‘Resolved:
That This House Would Re-
Elect Jimmy Carter.”

The Britishers will take the
affirmative.

Washington and Lee,s debate
team -- Washington and Lee be-
ing the school that it is, after all
-- will argue against.

The fracas is scheduled for
Tuesday, Oct. 3, in W&L’s Lee
Chapel, beginning at 7:30 p.m.
The public is invited to witness
the resumption of hostilities
between Great Britain and the
Colonies, and there is no
charge.

This is the sixth encounter in
recent years between the
debaters from W&L and teams
from Great Britain. Previous
topics they have argued have
ranged over whether America
needs a monarchy, whether
America is a_ ‘‘cultural

One of the most important
factors in leading a productive
and satisfying life is learning to
recognize and cope with the nor-

encounters in their daily living.
Students no less than anyone
else face a variety of stresses
and need to develop coping
strategies to enable them to get
the most out of their academic
and social pursuits.

Toward that end, Drs. Mike
Cappeto and Jim Worth are of-
fering a 6 week seminar entitled
“coping with normal life
stress’. Meeting for 6 weeks in
approximately hour-long §ses-
sions, they will focus on a varie-
ty of techniques which the in-

Center. All W&L students are
eligible to attend, free of

the Generals. The probelm was
that the front two runners, Rich
Bird and Bob Bates, W&L’s co-
captains, had already run the
longer portion when D&E’s men
cut it short. The cut occurred
immediately before a downhill
run, resulting in D&E’s runners
reaching the bottom first. They
were ahead of Bird and Bates
when earlier they had been 50
yards behind.

At the finish, the score was
27-28 in Davis and Elkin’s favor.
Upon protest, the problem was
resolved, and the score changed

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

On matters
financial

An E.C. budget hearing without bloodshed? Can it
be true? This annual autumn nightmare for student
leaders has always provoked lasting grudges; past
E.C. members have been known to doze openly or
leave the room for liquid courage, while the commit-
tee chairmen begged or brazened their way through
their requests for student tax money. But the current
E.C. members did their homework, and it showed.
The hearings were completed after only five hours —
and no major student organization lost more than 10%
of its original budget request.

This year, student groups requested over $81,000
from the student body tax fund. And even though the
university authorized a $5 tax hike per student, the
total of available funds Tuesday night was $75,000. No
surprise that budget cuts were an obvious result from
the start. What amazes me is how painlessly they
were achieved.

The grestest revision occurred with the Student Ac-
tivities Board, which annually claims about 40% of
the total fund. Maybe the SAB was filled with a spirit
of co-operation; perhaps the co-chairmen were simp-
ly nervous about facing three of their former
members, currently on the E.C. But at any rate, when
their turn came, they confronted the E.C. with $4,000
in self-made cuts. Suddenly, the E.C. found itself well
within the $75,000 limit without hardly twisting one
arm. A quick vote, and the budget was approved to
the sound of applause. So, thanks to the SAB officers
— a few dozen people got to bed earlier and happier
because of your concessions.

Especially encouraging was the E.C.’s growth of
support in other areas. The new English Club receiv-
ed its first official funding on Tuesday. Also, with
nearly 100% of its budget request approved, Contact
may be able to increase its program to seven top
speakers. And above all, pennies from heaven finally
fell on the long-suffering literary magazine Ariel. A
jump in funding of 50% will allow Ariel to increase its
size and number of issues — and even include color
photography.

Even we, the curmudgeons of the Ring-tum
Phi,came out of the hearings reasonably satisified.
The E.C.’s allotment of $4,750 to the newspaper only
covers 25% of our total costs, but it is still the largest
budget grant to the Phi in recent history. We thank
those students who expressed their support of the
newspaper to various E.C. members; it has allowed
us to retain our larger size and format.

Last week, we referred to the budget hearings as
“trench warfare.” Incredibly, it was far from that.
Not a voice was raised, nor was a moment wasted
Tuesday night. The current E.C. is obviously shooting
for an entire year without a major mistake. And if
they can make budget hearings an equitable process,
who’s to say they can’t do all the rest?

the war. Fonda is the wife,
waiting for her soldier/hus-

anxieties behind an officious
military facade. His wife (Fon-

old high school acquaintance
(Voight), a patient in the
hospital. Their love story is
often reminiscent of The Other

Tucker was then charged by
Magistrate Charles F.
Engleman, who said that Pur-
vis wouldn’t have stopped him
without good cause, and then
said, according to Tucker,
“Son, we may have missed you
on DUI, but you are high on
drugs; I can see it in your
eyes.”’ Tucker was then charg-
ed that he did “unlawfully
operate a motor vehicle on a
public highway under the in-
fluence of alcoholic beverages
or other self-administered in-

sort of change needs to be work-

tion is one which prohibits loud
noise such as stereo music after
11 p.m.

One fraternity president was
arrested two weeks ago for
violation of the statute.

The ‘‘concessions” presented
to the Council include the
limiting of fraternity parties to
Wednesday, Friday, and Satur-

be turned off at midnight on

of Section 14-42 of the Code of .

Tucker was denied bond that
night and had to spend the night
in jail. He was released on his
own recognizance after a call to
Dean John, who vouched for
him. While in jail, Tucker wrote
all that had happened on a piece

that “We don’t have time for

penalty will be imposed in the
event of a fraternity’s first of-
fense and revocation of all par-
tying priveledges may be the
result of subsequent violations.

“Coming Home”

the marine wife and crippled
veteran, the scriptwriters
(Waldo Scott and Robert C.
Jones) try to convey the emo-
tional hardships that we as a na-
tion endured during the Viet-
nam conflict. Voight represents
the veterans, the injured youth,
and the angry mobs of the pro-
test movement; Fonda, the con-
cerned but somewhat insignifi-
cant sympathizers and Dern,
the military mind, faced with
defeat, who keeps on shouting,
“T just want to be a hero.”
Fonda, Voight, and Dern all
turn out excellent per-
formances in their formidable
roles. Unfortunately, director
Hal Ashby doesn’t quite live up
to his subjects. The semi-
documentary style of Coming
Home, effectively sets the mood
of 1968 America. Make-up,

styles and music are all perfect,

but there are times when the
loud music becomes so annoy-
ing that it distracts, rather than
aids, audience attention.
Ultimately, in the last few
scenes of the film, Ashby’s
direction, where it should draw
the loose ends together, allows
the film, and its characters to
trickle off into a kind of subur-
ban obscurity.

Maybe it’s too soon for history
and films to view the Vietnam
war. in an objective light. Until
that happens, we will just have
to endure such inspired, but
uneven efforts as Coming
Home.

Student initiates investigation of police

Skoal (snuff) back; it was
thoroughly searched before it
was returned.

Tucker went to complain to
Chief Kirby. Tucker says that
Kirby seemed “fairly sym-
pathetic’’ and recommended
that he file a formal complaint,
which Tucker has done.

The case was tried on Sept.
12, before Judge Hess. Hess
dropped the DUI charge and
reduced the speeding charge to
34 mph in a 25 mph.

Tucker filed a two page com-
plaint on Executive Committee
stationary to Chief Kirby. In it,
Tucker states that “‘the purpose
of this letter is not to seek per-
sonal retribution against Of-
ficer Purvis, but to enable your
office to investigate the matter
to your satisfaction.”’

Purvis said in an interview
that he took Tucker in because
he felt Tucker’s behavior in-
dicated that he was intoxicated.
He said he had nothing to do
with Tucker having to spend the
night in jail despite proof of

sobriety or with Tucker being
held without bond; that those
things were up to the
magistrate.

Magistrate Engleman said
that he could not comment on
this specific case, but that he
has the power to hold anyone if
he sees fit, regardless of
whether they are legally drunk.
He said that it was up to his
discretion to hold Tucker even
though Tucker was proven not
intoxicated, but he would not

say why.
The matter is now under
police investigation. Tucker

closed his letter of complaint to
Kirby with “I feel that Purvis’
reaction to the situation is un-
called for and that he may
possibly have been attempting
to intimidate me with the two
charges. For these reasons, I
am officially bringing this mat-
ter to your attention so that you
may respond to it as you see

Convention :

This is the first of a weekly
series of articles about W&L’s
Mock Republican Convention,
which will be held in May, 1980.

In just a little less than 20
months Washington and Lee
students for the seventeenth
time will once again try to ac-
curately predict the presiden-
tial nominee for the party out of
power. The Mock Convention, a
proud tradition at W&L dating
back to 1908, is still a distant
event, but planning has been go-
ing on since the gavel closed the
1976 Convention — a Convention
that accurately nominated both
Jimmy Carter and Walter Mon-
dale. Highly regarded
throughout the nation for its
realism, the Washington and
Lee Mock Convention has the
reputation for being the most
accurate of the nation’s col-
legiate mock conventions. Time
magazine characterized it as
the “biggest and boomingest’’
of all such events. Newsweek
has called it ‘‘the most
realistic.” Syndicated colum-
nist David Brudnoy has said
that ‘‘the results have been im-
pressive over the long run” (11
right predictions, 5 wrong
ones). Such renowned

newspapers as the New York
Boston

Times, Globe,

Washington Post, and Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch have
said much the same thing.

With personal preferences
put aside, the Mock Convention
will be conducting a great deal
of research — trying to pick the
Republican candidate for presi-
dent in 1980. Already there is a
large field of potential can-
didates, from Ronald Reagan to
George Bush, and this fall the
majority of the work will begin.

The Mock Convention is the
largest single event held during
every student’s four years at
W&L — over $35,000 was spent
for the 1976 Convention. There
are numerous positions that
must be filled and every student
will have an opportunity to par-
ticipate, whether it be as a state
chairman, delegation member,
or steering committee member.
In keeping with its drive for ac-
curacy, the convention is divd-
ed into state delegations with
numbers equal to that of the ac-
tual Republican National Con-
vention. Within each delegation
numerous jobs will have to be
filled. For the convention as a
whole, there will also be many
positions. There will be groups
working on public relations and
media coverage, finance and
the parade through Lexington
which traditionally opens the

convention. Aside from the
research that state delegations
will conduct regarding how
their state will vote at the ac-
tual convention, there is a good
deal of work in other political
areas, such as committees to
monitor the campaigns of each
of the candidates, conduct hear-
ings and write the convention
platform, and direct research
into credentials procedures and
party rules.

In keeping with the Mock Con-
vention’s number one goal — to
promote political education and
enlightenment — a speaker’s
program will be held this year,
bringing influential Republican
leaders, potential candidates,
and nationally-known political

_ journalists to campus.

More information will be pro-
vided — check this column from
week to week. Applications for
state chairmanships and steer-
ing committee positions will ap-
pear later during the term.
Each position available will be
well defined with the applica-
tion procedures outlined. Also
to appear in this column are ar-
ticles regarding national
politics, from Republican party
direction to potential presiden-
tial candidates to significant na-

tional issues,

Rush Remembered

Rush! What is rush? Is it a
gaggle (as in geese) of up-
perclassmen, all identically
dressed in button-down Oxford
shirts, khakis, and topsiders,
babbling on about how diver-
sified the house is (’’Well, I’m
from Mobile and he’s from Bir-
mingham, don’t you know?’’) Is
it these same innocuous up-
perclassmen trying feverishly
to persuade some poor, in-
ebriated freshman that all he
has to do is tear the piece of
paper stuck to his chest for a
bond of allegiance to cement his
soul to that of the rest of the
fraternity until unpaid dues do
they part?

Let’s follow a_ freshman
through a session of open
houses. Without naming Greek
letters, he walks into the first
fraternity guided by a brute
who bears a_ strong
resemblance to Quasimodo of
Notre Dame. His appearance is

gorilla wearing shoulder pads
(the house president) who in-
forms our hero that the guide
was elected to the esteemed
position of house tackling dum-
my.

At house number two our un-
suspecting freshman has the
poor misfortune to be born
north of the Mason-Dixon line
and is immediately sent on the
attic tour. But he is treated like
royalty compared to a dark-
hued friend who can’t unders-
tand why some of the fraternity
members are cutting small
holes in sheets. ‘‘It isn’t time for
Halloween yet, is it?”’

The third house takes an im-
mediate dislike to our freshman
for one of the most insightful,
perceptive, and _ intelligent
reasons this side of New Haven
or Cambridge. There aren’t any
buttons to hold down the collars
on his shirt. He is given the
deluxe freezer tour complete
with hospitable scholar inside to
hand the freshman a coke
before returning to his organic
chemistry. This last caper
comes from a friend of mine in
one of Dean John’s favorite
fraternities.

The fourth fraternity is runn-
ing a gatoring contest. Those
who aren’t totally repulsed and
disgusted get bids, while those
that can’t rock it get sent to the
fifth fraternity on the card, the
Omegas of Faber College.

Cockpit employee can book bands, charge cover

by Randy Smith

The Executive Committee
voted Monday night to allow the
management of the Cockpit,
Washington and Lee’s tavern,
to contract entertainment bas-
ed on gate receipts from a cover
charge.

Burr Datz, assistant manager
of W&L’s food services, made
the request to hire bands on his
own discretion and pay them
with the monies received from
an entrance fee charged all
patrons.

His concern was not with

‘‘Noise”’

(continued from page 9)
that a warning be issued by the
police before arresting the of-
fender.

He also expressed hope that a
citizen-complaint policy might
be adopted, in which police ac-
tion be taken only after a
citizen-grievance has been
received. Such a policy might
help to eliminate the ‘‘subjec-
tivity of the police’ which
Dudley feels is the most disturb-
ing aspect of the ordinance.

Dudley further requested that
leniency of the ordinance be ex-
tended on W&L’s “‘big”’
weekends: Homecoming, Fan-

cy Dress Ball and Spring
Weekend.

usurping the power of the Stu-
dent Activities Board in br-
inging entertainment to the
Cockpit, he said, but in being
able to take advantage of bands
offering to play at W&L with on-
ly a few days advance notice.
“The Cockpit, as an enter-
tainment center, is getting a
pretty good name up and down
the East Coast,’ Datz said,
‘and if some band calls up, I
don’t want to have to tell them,
‘well, we've got a little political
situation here which means I
have to go to the students to see

brought to

suggested the use of an elec-
tronic decibel meter in the
judgement of noise violation, a
policy which has been adopted
by Charlottesville police. Such a
measure would hopefully lead
to “a more objective or-
dinance.”’

Dudley pointed out that the
fraternities have already made
Significant progress’’ in
decreasing the volume of noise.
He also noted that if the pro-
posal is adopted and violation of

 

if it’s o.k., and they don’t meet
‘till Monday.’”’

“If somebody does call up, I
don’t see why we can’t give
them (the students) the op-
portunity to see good bands,”’
Datz continued.

Junior E.C. representative
Steve Abraham said, ‘the
students are paying for use of
this facility (the Cockpit) and
they shouldn’t have to pay
again.’’ He recommended that
persons not connected with the
University be charged a higher
price at the gate. ‘I definately

In conclusion, Dudley asked
that the Council take a good
look at the problem, speculating
that “the City of Lexington
might be in for an unnecessarily
unpleasant year” if something
is not done.

think a W&L student should be
charged less,”’ he said.

The E.C. resolved to
authorize Datz ‘‘to contract
entertainment’’ whose salary
would be based solely on gate
receipts. The plan is to be on a
trial basis during the first
semester and will be reexamin-
ed by the E.C. after Christmas.

In other action at Monday’s
Executive Committee meeting,
Bill Tucker, vice-president of
the E.C., disclosed that the
committee has not retained a

treasurer as prescribed in the
student body constitution. °

The treasurer is supposed to
write all checks,must not be a
member of the student body,
and must be approved by the
President of the University.

Tucker said that as far as he
could estimate, there had not
been a treasurer retained by the
E.C. for three years. The last
person to hold the job was a
retired banker in town who was
treasurer for 45 years, Tucker
said

VOLUME LXVIV

W&L’s New Computer is Unreliable

Part one of a series.

by Stuart Snyder

Washington and _ Lee’s
relatively new computer
system has been having more
than its fair share of problems.
Approximately 600-students will
use the new system this year. In
the next two years, the average
student will probably use it five
more times in his courses.

Yet, neither the Harris Cor-
poration, the company from
which the computer was pur-
chased, nor Dr. Thomas Im-
eson, Head of the Computer
Center, know what the majority
of the problems stem from.
However, twenty to thirty per-
cent can be attributed to power
fluctuations caused by the Vep-
co line to the campus, said Im-
eson.

Computer “unreliable”

The superiority of this com-
puter is offset by its unreliabili-
ty. Since it was brought in on
October 27, 1977, it has broken
down or been ‘‘down”’ about fif-
teen to twenty percent of the
business weeks, Monday
through Friday, Imeson said.

In fact, in the first six months
of operation the system was not
dependable at all, comments
Imeson. However, in the “last
four months the reliability has
considerably increased, but as
yet it (the computer) is not
wholly satisfactory,” states Im-
eson.

Although the computer
operators try to keep the Center
open twenty-four hours a day, it
often goes down unexpectedly.

OER Onn

These unfortunate ‘‘downs”’
burden the students by making
assignments late and cramp
professors because of the pro-
blems.

During the week, it is schedul-
ed for regular ‘‘down’’ sessions.
These times are posted in the
Computer Center. The sessions
are needed for the adding or
deleting of computer user
numbers, programs and other
data. But, besides these regular
sessions, the computer takes
some of its own.

The last big shut down lasted
three-and-a-half to four days,
between Wednedsay, Sept. 20
and Saturday, Sept. 23. The pro-
blem was a combination of

University Council says:
Fancy Dress Tradition
Will Remain

by Alan Kendrick

The annual date for
Washington and Lee’s Fancy
Dress Ball will remain the
weekend after the Winter
Break, the University Council
(U.C.) decided unanimously in
last Thursday afternoon’s
crowded meeting.

The U.C.’s decision brings a
halt to a faculty movement to
set Fancy Dress forward one
week to the middle of the winter
break, ostensibly to prevent the
festivities from interfering with
classes and course preparation.

The motion to move Fancy
Dress weekend, introduced by
Harlan Beckley, assistant pro-
fessor of religion, came as a
culmination of a growing
resentment of a few faculty
members to the amount of time
‘‘wasted”’ during the week after
break by students pursuing
social activities.

Beckley stated that he
brought the motion to the U.C.
because of token approval by
students at an Executive Com-
mittee meeting last year when
further action was postponed.

The U.C., a joint committee
representing faculty, students,
and administration, has final
approval on all student affairs.
Discussion of the motion was
participated in by a number of
students and faculty members,
as well as Beckley.

Beckley stated that the entire
week between the holiday and
Fancy Dress is wasted due to
the late return by some
students, a commencement of
festivities as early as Wednes-
day, and a one to three day
hangover period after the
weekend.

Student representative Bob
Mullican said that he had not

hardware and software dif-
ficulties. Software includes the
tapes, programs and operating
systems, whereas hardware en-
compasses the _ physical
machinery. .
According to Mr. William
‘Hartbarger, the Computer
Operator, the Harris people had
been modifying some wiring in
the computer Wednesday morn-
ing and finished before lunch.

        

When Mr. Hartbarger came
back from lunch, the system
was malfunctioning. Specifical-
ly the computer showed that it
was caused by a hardware pro-

. blem.

The Harris people were called
back. After an inspection, the
serviceman found that he had
connected a wire the wrong
way; he denied that it had
anything to do with the

NUMBER 4

malfunction.

Apparently whatever the pro-
blem was, it had also affected
the software. So, for the re-
mainder of the week, the Harris
repair crew tried in vain to cor-
rect the problem.

Finally, on Friday night, they
called the Harris Corporation’s
“trouble shooter,’’ Mr. Richard
Reynolds, who is the company’s
expert. He had it working by
Saturday.

Mr. Hartbarger adds that the
bulk of the time was taken up
acquiring test parts.

To combat the plaguing pro-
blems with the computer, the
Harris Corporation is sending

two specialized represen-
tatives, one versed in hardware
and the other in software. They
will be en campus this Thurs-
day and Friday to inspect the
whole computer system in
order to determine the exact
troubles with the system.
Other problems

Other less serious but impor-
tant problems exist: over-
crowding of the terminals,
which are the students connec-
tion with the computer, and
faculty children using the com-
puter.

Students often experience an
overcrowding in the Computer

Grain Parties face

ABC “crackdown”

Sophomore class officials
have announced that, due to an

ABC “crackdown” on grain
parties, the traditional
Homecoming event at

Zollman’s Pavilion will have to
be limited to students and their
guests.

The party is scheduled for
Saturday, October 14.

“Class passes” will be re-
quired for admittance to the
party. These will be sold in ad-
vance only at the Co-op next
Tuesday through Friday, Oc-
tober 10-13, from 12 to 2 p.m.

If alumni wish to attend the
party, they may pick up special

Climbing Aoitens

A W&L freshman reportedly
took a severe fall during a
mountain climbing outing in
West Virginia last weekend.

Henry Clay, of Shreveport,
La., slipped from a sheer rock
face, fell fifteen feet to a ledge,
glanced off and continued to
drop an additional sixty feet,
where his fall was arrested ap-

proximately eight feet above a
rock ledge by his lifeline,
belayed to a piton which for-
tunately held.

Clay suffered injuries to the
head from contact with the
rocks and bruised back from
the pressure of the lifeline, but
was otherwise unhurt. He is
currently attending classes on a
normal basis.

 

Correction

Due to typographical and
printer’s errors, a story appear-
ing on the front page of last
week’s edition erroneously
stated that W&L senior Bill
Tucker had filed a complaint
against the conduct of both Lex-
ington police officer Jack Pur-
vis and Police Chief James A.
Kirby. The story should have
read:

‘Washington and Lee senior
Bill Tucker has filed a com-
plaint to Lexington Police Chief
James A. Kirby against the con-
duct of police officer Jack Pur-
vis when Purvis arrested

Tucker on charges of speeding
and driving under the influence
of alcohol (DUI).”

The story was factually ac-
curate when written, but the
first paragraph was changed
during the printing process and
the error was not caught in time
by the editor.

In addition, the advice to Tuc-
ker to file an official complaint
came not from Kirby, but from
City Manager John Doane.

The Ring-tum Phi regrets the
errors and any inconvience they
may have caused Chief Kirby.

PreMed Situation Improved

by Mike Perry

Last May, the Ring-tum Phi
reported that the acceptance
rate among applicants to
medical professional schools
had declined to 40% and that
two Phi Beta Kappa graduates
had yet to be accepted.

Dr. James Starling, coor-
dinator of the premedical ad-
visory board reports that sum-
mer acceptances have boosted
the acceptance rate among 1978
premedical graduates to 55.1%
(16 of 29) including Phi Beta
Kappa graduate John Sacco’s
acceptance to the Mediacl Col-
lege of Virginia in Richmond
and Rutgers Medical College. -

While the acceptance rates
for 1977 (65%) and 1978 (55%)
graduates re still low, Starling
points out that these percen-
tages are likely to increase in
the near future as unaccepted
graduates who reapply and gain
acceptance are added to the
total accepted for their respec-
tive classes.

The premedical advisory
group has focused its concern
on the decline in the per-
formance of Washington and
Lee students on the Medical
College Admission Test, a stan-
dardized exam taken by all ap-
plicants to medical schools.

The Medical College Admis-
sions Test, considered to be a
prime determinant in most
medical college admission pro-
cesses, now appears to place
great emphasis on the sciences.
Based on declining MCAT
scores and student feedback,
Dr. Thomas Nye, Chairman of
the Biology Department and a
member of the premedical ad-
visory group, explains that the
advisors are now recommen-
ding that premedical students

“get more science background
material before they take the
MCAT.”

The premedical
board now suggests that
students take Organic
Chemistry, a demanding
course, considered to be one of
the primary courses that
medical schools look at when
evaluating applicants, in their
sophomore rather than junior
year. The advisory board hopes
that this change will encourage
premedical students to take ad-
ditional science courses in the
fall and winter of their junior
year as preparation for the
MCAT.

Although the effects of these
ohanges in curriculum, as
reflected in student per-
formance on the MCAT and in
medical school admissions, will
not be known for three to four
years, several effects are readi-
ly apparent. Several science
faculty members fear that at-
tempts to boost MCAT scores
may jeopardize the goals of a
well-rounded and liberal arts
oriented education. Michael A.
Pleva, associate professor of
chemistry and member of the
premedical advisory board,
suggests that the addition of
organic chemistry to the
sophomore year workload
forces premedical students to
make ‘‘serious decisions earlier
in their college careers’ and
will “require a greater commit-
ment to the sciences.”

Pleva adds that premedical
faculty advisors have reluctant-
ly recommended an increase in
the number of science courses
taken by premedical students.
Many liberal arts schools are
irate over the prospects of a

advisory

change in the nature of the
MCAT, they fear that
premedical students will be
forced to study science at the
exclusion of other fields.
Medical colleges have stated a
preference for the broad educa-
tion provided at a liberal arts
college, but continue to place a
great deal of weight on the in-
creasingly science oriented
MCAT.

Acting chairman of the
Physics Department Dr.
William Newbolt feels that the
test may continue to change and
that the University ‘‘cannot
predicate an entire curriculum
on one test.’’ Newbolt
recognizes the need to better
equip the premedical students
to gain entrance to medical
school, but he claims that these
changes pose other important
problems. Dr. Newbolt claims
that the deferment of physics
until the junior year disrupts
the logical progression of the
material and will require the
addition of a general psysics
course to be taken in the junior
year. Such a course would be
geared specifically to the needs
of the premedical student.

For at least one member of
the premedical advisory group
the decision to offer premedical
students more preparation in
the sciences is merely a realiza-
tion of the needs of premedical
students. Physics Department
Chairman Dr. John Wise
believes that most premedical
students, much like the MCAT,
are oriented toward the
sciences and “‘have included at
least that much science above
the bare minimum in their ma-
jor program in the past.”

Freshman P.E. test
dropped; Law students
ask for separate
graduatin date

by Alan Kendrick

At the September University
Council meeting, Dean of
Students Lewis John announced
that, at the recommendation of
the Physical Education Depart-
‘ment, the Committee in Courses
and Degrees will drop the Motor
Ability Test as a prerequisite
for selection of freshman
physical education courses.

Also, Law School U.C.
Representative Tom Healy
brought to the attention of the
committee a grievance on
behalf of law school students
over having to wait after
finishing classes to hold their
graduation in conjunction with
the undergraduate school.

Many law students are upset
by the sixteen-day delay bet-
ween the end of law school,
which comes unusually early
according to Dean John, and the
June 7 graduation, which is
unusually late, due to the
undergraduate spring holiday.
The undergraduate and law
school graduations have tradi-
tionally been held together.

The feelings of many law
students were expressed in an
editorial by associate editor
Dave Johnson in last week’s
Law News. Excerpt follows:

“The final blow, however, in
this long endured status as se-
cond class citizens, is that law
students will be forced to wait
for two and one half weeks after
final exams to graduate, simply
because it is felt that the law
school should hold its gradua-
tion at the same time as the
undergraduate school. Many
law students have bar review
courses that will prevent them
from attending. Others have
jobs. Even for those law
students who are not prevented
from attending graduation by
one or both of these obstacles
there is still the financial
burden of being unemployed
and remaining in Lexington, or
of traveling back to Lexington.

(Healy announced that peti-
tion had been signed by 96 of 126
senior law students at the time
of the U.C. meeting.) _

Gary Dobbs said, ‘‘A double
graduation would cause
unbelievable trouble” in terms

making arrangements.

The U.C. did vote 17-5 to pass

“to reschedule the law school

date prior to June 4” to the

further consideration.

Fancy Dress Tradition Preserved

\(continued from page 7)

noticed students in-
discriminately skipping
classes, and that the class
absences and _ preparation
clump was probably a reflec-
tion on small work
assignments. Mullican further
stated that students should be
allowed to decide which classes
they could afford to miss, and
that the U.C. should not address
itself to restricting students’
prerogatives.

Beckley replied that his idea
was not to impose regulations,
but to construct the weekend so
that it would not conflict with
coursework or cause tempta-
tion for students; the weekend
should be scaled down where
possible, he added.

Professor Gary Dobbs of the
Biology Department stated that
he had seen opposition to the
motion last year, which had
been the first time in recent
years that the faculty had at-
tempted any influence in setting
the Fancy Dress date.

“Fancy Dress is a good op-
portunity for the
undergraduates to exercise
their own judgement,’’ Dobbs
said. ‘This motion deprive the
students of an opportunity to
practice maturity,’’ Dobbs con-
tinued.

Hank Hall, Student Activities
Board co-chairman (the com-
mittee responsible for putting
on Fancy Dress), said that it
would not be feasible to stage
Fancy Dress over the holiday.
“We sacrifice our own holidays
to present the best weekend
possible,”’ he said.

Student Executive Commit-
tee vice-president Bill Tucker
said he felt that the faculty had
become particularly annoyed
after last year when the Four
Tops concert and Fancy Dress
had been scheduled hack-to-
back.

This sequence of events was
unusual, he said, and pains will
be taken to assure that such a
close scheduling of entertain-
ment does not happen again.

“Students have the holiday to
get home and away from cam-
pus. They shouldn’t have to stay
here just to attend the dance,”
said Carren Kaston, assistant
professor of English.

“Some students would stay,
some would not. This would be
an excellent chance to exercise
their judgement,’’ Beckley
replied.

David Hamra, student co-
chairman of the U.C., said that
he viewed big weekends as ‘‘an
added incentive to work harder
before and after” the entertain-

ment events.

Kaston said that she didn’t
want the students to miss out on
Fancy Dress, but that she did
object to students missing her
class. ‘‘If teachers make the ef-
fort to hold class, students
should attend,’ she said.

When the vote was taken, all
the members of the U.C. voted
to set Fancy Dress at the nor-
mal date, one week after the
winter break (which will fall in
the first week in March this
year).

Mainstream will be there. Watch next week’s Entertainment page for coverage.

Musical Mainstream

Last Wednesday, Bob Seger
came to Roanoke to do what he
supposedly does best, i.e., to
show off his widely acclaimed
talents on stage. Considering
his reputation, which is based
almost entirely on the image of
Bob Seger as the ‘‘Old Faithful”
of rock’n’roll, the hardworking,
reliable musician who has
payed his dues on the road for
the past 13 years, one would ex-
pect him to be able to master-
fully work his audiences to
achieve whatever effect he
desired. Right? Wrong.

If anything is truly excep-
tional about Seger it is that,
despite all his years of ex-
perience and the relatively high
quality of his recent material,
he still comes across as little
more than a juurneyman rocker
trying to emulate the success of
his artistic superiors. Sure, the
crowd may have been on their
feet for nearly the entire show,
but their “Look, ma, I’m at a
rock concert’ boisterousness
actually seemed to work to
Seger’s disadvantage. It was
cruelly obvious that the majori-
ty of the audience knew Bob
Seger simply as the guy who hit
the charts with ‘‘Night Moves”’

 

a few years back. His older
songs were practically ignored
and when he sang “Beautiful
Loser’’, none seemed to know
what he was talking about.
Which is sad, for ‘‘Beautiful
Loser’’, despite the fact that it
is no more outstanding musical-
ly than the rest of his older
material, is one of the most
brutally honest recognitions of
personal failure ever written.
The title itself is a perfectly ac-
curate description of Seger’s
position in the overall scheme of
rock’n’roll. No one can question
the sincerity of his efforts, but
he is destined to remain in se-
cond place, due to no other
reason than a simple lack of

true inspiration. RM

Betsy delights;
Tycoon’ s a fright

 

 

by Dash Coufal

A few Sundays ago I caught
the nine o'clock show ofThe
Greek Tycoon, only to be disap-
pointed. Though I consider
myself a serious student of the
cinema (meaning that I see all
those obscure French movies at
obscure theaters called “Art
Houses,’’ by The New Yorker.
And you don’t even know who
Isabella Huppert is!) on occa-
sion I will go to see a “‘trashy”’
movie for sheer vicarious
pleasure. Even in the context of
being a ‘Bad’’ movie, The
Greek Tycoon is still one of the
worst movies I have ever seen,
ranking with Mothra vs. God-
zilla.

There are basically four types
of trashy movies I like’ science
fiction, spy thrillers, spaghetti
westerns, and scandal flicks. Of
these four, all that is left to us is
the scandal movie; _ those
delicious poisioned bon-bons of
sexual deviation, family
secrets, and  conspicious
money. The best of these isThe
Betsy, the worst is The Greek
Tycoon. So rhetorically I shall
ask: Why does one high budget
trashy movie succeed and the
other fail?

They both have good actors
for stars. Tycoon has Jaqueline
Bisset and Anthony Quinn (who
took the job because Jackie 0.
failed to say hello to him in a
cafe). But the supporting actors
are poor. And what good is
Bisset if they have her in bed

Eye And Ear:
From She Bookstore

Did you ever wonder what
“cutouts” are or why they’re so
cheap? Did you ever wonder
about the quality of cutout
recordings? Since you can find
them in nearly every record
store they must be popular sell-
ing items, right? Right.

A cutout is quite literally an
album that has been discon-
tinued stock. These. ‘‘cutout’’
records are then sold en masse
to cutout record companies at a
very low price. This low price is
then passed on to the dealers
who sell the cutouts cheaply to
his customers. Cutout records
can usually be identified by the
notches cut out of their jackets.
These notches are cut off the
jackets to help companies be
sure dealers don’t return
cutouts. Cutouts cannot be
returned for any reason. The
notches also help the customer
know that he should not be
paying full price for a cutout
LP.

Companies’ discontinue
albums entirely for business,
not artistic reasons. You can,
therefore, find many real gems
in the cutout bin. Many true
classics are cutouts and once an
album is cut out it is rarely

rereleased in its entirity. For
example, nearly every Beach
Boys album is now a cutout, as
are the albums of David
Bromberg, The’ Byrds,
Donovan, Dr. John, Firesign
Theatre, Richie Havens, Rare
Earth, Spirit, John Sebastion,
Three Dog Night, and many
others.

Since so many of these
coutouts will never be found
again it’s a good idea to keep
track of the cutout stock at the
record stores in town. These
stores get new cutouts every
four to six weeks. Buying
cutouts is an excellent way to
expand your record collection
without destroying your budget.

with the sheets over her
shoulders and saying hack lines
like, “You don’t have to tell me
how to act! I know I am the wife
of the president!’’ Though The
Betsy has only one famous ac-
tor, Lawrence Olivier, the sup-
porting cast is excellent and
they aren’t acting in material
that is below their ability.

Plot. Plot makes or breaks
trashy movies. There are two
aspects of trashy plots, the first
is the “‘mise-en-scene”’ (in this
case scandal), the second is
conflict and resolution.

The scandal should be about a
well known family and should
tell or insinuate unmentionable
things. Tycoon is a great disap-
pointment. Working with Jackie
0. and Ari Onassis one would
think that there is great poten-
tial; that potential remains un-
tapped by this movie, as the on-
ly scandal is the Onassis
brothers wrestling on the floor.
The Betsy which is supposed to
be about the Henry Fords, is full
of poised delicasies. Of which
Olivier’s going to bed with his
gay son’s wife and her saying,
“T always knew it would be like
this,” is only the tantalising
beginning. (Things really get
rolling when the husband kills
himself in the foyer and his
three year old son .goes up to
tell mommy...) No wonder Lu-
cian (now president of the cor-
poration) hates Grandpapa so
much,

A strong conflict and a good
resolving ending are basic to all
movies. Tycoon’s only conflict
is whether or not Quinn will get
Bisset, and we already know
that. The movie ends when his
son dies (we knew that too) and
a doctor tells him he will die
soon and thus can’t run for

did he say he wanted to be presi-

Jazz Review

by Spencer Leffel

After playing accoustically
for the last few years with his
Indian band Shakti, British
guitarist John McLaughlin has
returned to electric playing on
his latest album, aptly entitled
“Electric Guitarist.’’ And he
has returned with a vengeance.
This album rates. with
McLaughlin’s best Mahavishnu
Orchestra work and is one of the
best Jazz-rock records of the
year.

McLaughlin assembled a
large cast of musicians to pro-
duce the album, allowing him to
play with a different group on
every song. This not only pro-
duces interesting variety, but
also permits one to listen to the
subtle changes McLaughlin
makes in his playing as he
adapts to various musicians. He
handles all the situations well;
from his funky, humorous play-
ing of ‘“‘Are You The One? Are
You The One?”’ to the soaring,
joyous duet with Carlos Santana
in “Friendship”, McLaughlin
demonstrates his virtuosity.

“Do You Hear The Voices
You Left Behind?’’, the best
song on the album, is strictly
jazz. Dedicated to tenor sax-
ophone immortal John Col-
trane, the tune features one of
the best jazz quartets to be
assembled in recent years:
McLaughlin, Chick Corea on
piano and mini-moog syn-
thesizer, Stanley Clarke on ac-
coustic bass and Jack De-
Johnette on drums. From a
free-form beginning, the song
takes off on Clarke’s running
(not walking) bass. DeJohnette
rides with the beat on his cym-
bals, while at the same time
creating amazing rhythmic ten-
sions with off-beat snare, tom,
and bass drum shots. Besides
playing excellent accompany-
ment for McLaughlin, Corea
gets in two fine solos, one on
piano and one on synthesisor.
But McLaughlin shines

The Washington and Lee Con-
cert Guild season opens with
Terry Strange, pianist, on Mon-
day, October 9, 1978, at 8 p.m.,
in Lee Chapel.

A resident of Lexington,
Terry has contributed im-
mensely to the musical life of
the community as pianist with
the Rockbridge Chorus and Or-
chestra, organist and choir
director at the Timber Ridge
Presbyterian Church, as a
teacher at the Fine Arts
Workshop, and by maintaining
a private teaching studio in his
home.

Terry has taught at the Cadek
Conservatory in Chattanooga,
Tennesee, and at Southern
Seminary in Buena Vista. He
received his Bachelor of Music
degree from Oberlin College,
Master of Music degree from
Indiana University, studying
with Arthur Weiscz, and has
done doctoral work with Julio
Estevan at the Peabody Conser-
vatory in Baltimore. He has
performed at King College in
Bristol, Tennesee, and has had
recitals locally.

brightest. Unlike many
guitarists (Al DiMeola_ im-
mediately comes to mind),
McLaughlin knows when and
when not to show his hand; he
doesn’t try to blow you away
with his fastest licks when they
aren’t appropriate. But the
sizzling rhythms provided here
by Clarke, DeJohnette and Cor-
ea practically beg for hot solo-
ing, and McLaughlin cooks. His
playing is crisp, tasteful and in-
deed reminiscent of some old
Coltrane solos. This song alone
might be worth the price of the
album.

Happily, the rest of the album
is excellent as well. It would be
difficult to find a better line-up
of jazz-rock musicians. Besides
those already mentioned, the
album includes drummers Billy
Cobham, Tony Williams and
Michael Walden, bassists Jack
Bruce and Alphonso Johnson,
keyboardist Patrice Rushen
and violinist Jerry Goodman.
This is still a partial listing, but
if you’ve been following jazz-
rock at all, no more names are
necessary to make the point.
It’s hard to go wrong with musi-
cians of such high calibre, and
McLaughlin hasn’t. His return
to the electric guitar is a
triumph.

A Grit’s Eye View

by Carl Perry

Catchy title, right? Now you
are probably expecting an off-
beat story about some local
hoodlum’s views of world pro-
blems. But that is not the case.
This column will be a semi-
regular feature of theRing-tum-
Phi, especially for the W&L grit
community.

It probably comes as a sur-
prise to many that such a com-
munity exists, but let me assure
you that there is a sizable

The program for this recital
comprises the music of Bach,
Albeniz, Griffes and features
the monumental Variations and
Fugue on a Theme of Handel by
Brahms. As with all Concert
Guild presentations, student ad-
mission is free.

 

Ace Weems and the Fat Meat
Boys will perform in the
Cockpit tonight from 7:30 -
10:30. This is their first per-
formance in the Cockpit this
year.

They placed second in Old-
time competition at Lithia, and
won first place at the competi-
tion at Johnson City. They have
played at the Sea View Inn on
Martha’s Vineyard for two of
the past three years, and the
other year was composed of a
tour through Europe, with
many engagements in Ger-
many, Paris, France, and even
the Brazen Head in Dublin,
England. They recorded an
album last spring for the Car-
ryon label, which shotld be
coming out soon.

minority of grits on campus.
Unfortunately, due to social
pressures, most are forced to
keep their affliction to
themselves. But probably a
greater surprise is that even
more W&L men are ‘‘latent’’
grits.

Self-Help Quiz

The prupose of this first col-
umn is to help you latent grits
out there discover yourselves
via a self help quiz. Below are
several auestigns; if you
' any one of
esitate before
quite possibly
you have been a grit for many
years and have never known it.

Do you feel your heart race a
little faster when you see a car
leaving rubber at an intersec-
tion? Or when you turn on the
“ole” C.B. and put the petal to
the metal? Do you think PBR
should be the national drink,
served at all state occasions?
Do you have this almost un-
controllable urge to wear white
socks with your tuxedo? Do you
enjoy the feel of a gun in your
hands? Do you get particular
satisfaction when you physical-
ly dominate your wimpy room-
mate?

Prabably a majority of you
had difficulty saying no to one
or more questions (living North
of the Mason-Dixon line is no ex-
emption, either). Consequently
you have some tendency toward
grithood. So consider this col-
umn your guide to happiness
and the good things in life.

In future weeks, such things
as the grits’ answer to baseball,
how to make moonshine, and
other topics of interest will be
discussed.

club organizes

In its first several meetings,
the club, which is open to both
majors and non-majors in
English, detailed the aims of
the club for the comming school
year.

A prime activity of the club
will be the sponsorship of
speakers on literary topics of
general, but not exclusive in-
terest to students enrolled in
English courses. To this end,
the club was granted $100 by the
E.C. during the recent budget
hearings.

Other club interests include
the organization of a group of
seminars to aid majors in
preparing for the English com-
prehensive examination.

Another function of the club
will be to send a_ student
representative to departmental
meetings to insure that student
opinion with regard to cur-
riculum and other matters is
expressed.

As well the club forsees play-
ing some role in the selection of

 

new faculty members. (i.e., as
is the case at some other
schools, this would include lun-
ching with a job candidate and
offering impressions of said
candidate to the dapartment. )

The club wants to illuminate
the selection process for
seminar topics, which are now
the object of student sugges-
tions, though nobody knows
quite how.

Finally, the club plans to con-
tact similar groups at neighbor-
ing schools in an effort to share
information and activities. In
this vein, today marks the open-
ing get together of the Sweet
Briar Play Reading Group.
With a carlaod of English club
members in attendence the
group will open their season by
reading ‘‘Philadelphia Story”

The English club will con-
tinue to meet periodically to
discuss the issues as well as
future club activities. All in-
terested students are cordially
invited to attend.

control of the corporation bet-
ween Olivier and his grand-son
Lucian. The movie ends when
the great-grand- daughter’s
lover. (a brilliant engineer)
wins the stock fight by buying
stock with mafia money. Ty-
coon has no ending, The Betsy
does.

Sex is absolutely necessary
for trashy movies. Not the overt
sex found in blue (perhaps more
aptly called ‘“‘pink’’) movies,
but fleeting glimpses and seduc-
tive manners. The thrill is in-
tended to be who is going to bed
with whom and how they got
them there, rather than what
they do there; seduction is the
key. Here Tycoon fails again.
Quinn beds two women in Ty-
coon. The first is his mistress
from the start, so there is no
seduction there and besides the
only thing we see them do is
wrestle in bed (he gets a knee in
the groin.) In order to get Ja-
queline Bisset in bed he has to
marry her, yawn; and we only
see her completely covered by
almost unwrinkled sheets.
Yawn. The Betsy is tremendous
in this respect however. So-
meone is always seducing or be-
ing secuded, and half the time
it’s Oliver. Never overt, the sex
is noe the less deliciously
voyeuristic; Yum Yum.

In short, The Greek Tycoon is
a waste; but I’d go out of my
way to see The Betsy.

Recently, they were denied
the chance to play at a
Democratic Rally for Andrew
Miller because of their name.
None of the members of the
band answers questions about
their intriguing name, but
research by a history major has
paid off: Ace Weems was a very
influential shepherd in Scotland
during the sixteenth century,
and his “Fat Meat Boys” are
said to be the first members of a
very selective shepherd union.
When one of “The Boys”
became overly attached to one
of Ace’s sheep, he killed the boy
on the spot, and fled to nearby
Nelson County with all of his
Boys. For years they continued
to herd sheep during the day,
and fiddle like hell one the
nights.

The band members are:
James Leva and Chad Crumm
on fiddle, Forest McQuire on
banjo, Steve Seal on guitar and
Michael James Kott on cello.

Also slated for a performance
in the Cockpit is the band,
“Trigger Happy’’. At this time
they are the second hottest band
in the entire city of Baltimore,
and play a very fine mixture of
rock and roll and country rock.
They will be playing from 8:00
until 12:30, and there will be a
cover charge, all of which will
go directly to the band. The
charge will be $1.00 for all
students and their dates; $1.25
for all others.

bined with endless references to
Harleys, sidewalks ‘‘paved with
gold,” neon signs, and “‘broken
angels,”’ serve to undermine the
validity of any spark of
originality that might occa-
sionally appear. Add to all this
the fact that Chinnock’s (you
guessed it!!) gravelly baritone
is one of the most unwieldy and
lifeless voices I have ever heard
on record, and you come up
with what is surely one of the
most brutal efforts to the vinyl
shortage in recent memory. ae

Convention :

This is one in a series of ar-
ticles describing the 1980 W&L
Republican Mock Convention—
its development § and
progress.

At the Executive
Committee’s budget hearing
last week the Mock Convention
made no request for funding
this year. It was, therefore, no
major shock or setback when
none was received. The Mock
Convention, however, is in no
way a-cheap exercise. It’s

estimated that the 1980 conven-
tion’s total expenditures will ex-
ceed $40,000. Although it sounds
like a lot it’s easy to see where
the money goes when the wide
variety of costs are broken
down.

Paying for speakers both
before and during the conven-
tion weekend takes up about a
tenth of the budget. This in-
cludes not only the standard
honorarium but the expenses in-
curred by the speakers
themselves. Turning the gym
into the Convention Center
takes an enormous amount of
decorations and labor. The prin-
ting of the journal, which is
usually distributed for free, is a
rather sizable expense. The ma-
jority of the money used in put-
ting on a convention the size of
W&L’s is in the actual research
iteslf. These expenses include
printing, postage, and
telephone use. Altogether it ac-
counts for about a third of the
budget. This is‘one of the things
that makes the convention at
Washington and Lee unique -
the emphasis above all else
upon accuracy.

The surprising thing about
the Mock Convention is just how
cheap it is for students
themselves. The five dollar ad-

The morning after —

Thurston Howell IV (Where
else besides W&L would a
Howell go?) wearily rolls out of
bed im his second floor, one
room suite, at TKB (Tappa
Kegga Brew). The reason for
Thurston’s ‘“early’’ arousal
(It’s 9:30 a.m. and his first class
isn’t ‘til “‘D’’.) is that one of his
loving fraternity brothers
hadn’t gotten enough of ‘‘Be
Young, Be Foolish’ the night
before, even though the party
clamored on until a mere six
hours ago, and just had to get
his fix by blasting his stereo so
loud that the dentist and his
secretary located across the
street are now doing the Swing.

Our hero dresses in the school
uniform; you heard what that
consists of in this column last
week, folks. Notebooks now
must be found amongst the clut-
ter of his room. ‘‘Hammers and

Nails” and ‘Chopsticks 101”
meet today while the search for
the books to his courses in
“Primitive Art in Mozambi-
que’ and “Rocks for Jocks’’
can wait for tomorrow.

Last night’s regalia left a
devastation to rival Hiroshima.
Most of the windows are things
of the past, and being the mid-
dle of January the living room
is more frigid than the biggest
prudes from the Briar, although
one considerate soul managed
to wedge a VMI Keydet into one
of the frames. Meanwhile, the
poor Rat is wondering how
many demerits he gets for hav-
ing his boots filled with beer.
Little does he know that the
penalty for missing a night in
the barracks (otherwise known
as A.W.0.L.) is attendance at a
W&L Faculty meeting, a fate
far worse than the firing squad.

dition to the student tax is the
only direct financial contribu-
tion students make. Broken
down over four years it comes
out to a dollar and a quarter a
year for one of the most rewar-
ding and memorable of college
experiences. The rest of the fun-
ding comes from three major
sources.

First and most important are
the contributions from parents
and foundations. Specifically,
the Halton W. Sumner’s Foun-
dation of Dallas, Texas has
been most generous over the
years with the convention. Con-
tributions undoubtedly account
for the majority of the Conven-
tion’s income. Revenue from
journa! advertisements offer
the next source of income. The
money is used to help defray the
cost of the journal’s printing.

Lastly, the state delegations
raise money themselves in a
number of ways. The money the
States raise goes towards the
building of their floats, delega-
tion parties, and any research
costs not covered by the Steer-
ing Committee. A small tax is
levied upon the delegations to
help cover the costs they incur
at the expense of the entire con-
vention. With these four sources
of income the convention should
be able to maintain its relative
size. The increase in certain
costs such as postage have put a
little greater strain on the con-
vention but an ambitious
development program should
help meet demands.

later.

Dr. Turner’s research in-
terests included computer
technology, and he was exten-
sively involved in the develop-
ment of W&L’s computer
center. In 1967-68 he carried out
pioneering research for the U.S.
Office of Education on the im-
plications of modern technology
for small-college libraries.

W&L President Huntley, then a
professor of law, worked -with
Dr. Turner in the early stages of
that research.

Dr. Turner was a deacon of
Manly Memorial Baptist

Thurston settles down to the
newspaper where he finds that
even if W&L can’t win a game
at least they have no trouble in
scheduling them; ‘Everybody
wants us for their Homecoming
game.” A quick perusal of the
comics brings Howell up to date
on Popeye and the Wizard of Id.
Steve Canyon is too deep. The
rest of the paper is tossed aside
as if it’s contagious. Not enough
pictures.

There’s absolutely no ques-
tion as to whether he’s going to
walk to school or not. After all,
it’s only a quarter of a mile
away, so he hops in his 1978
Grand Riviera and mutters, *‘I
wonder when I'm going to get

Freshman QB effort not
enough - W&L loses 28-14

by Bill Whalen
The Washington and Lee
Generals lost their Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference opener
to Randolph-Macon College,
28-14, in a game played last

Water polo Generals go 2-0;
tourney this weekend

by Sam Campbell

The water polo Generals,
W&L’s most successful and
most exciting fall team, started
off their 1978 season with a bang
last Saturday as they captured
the Johns Hopkins Invitational
Championship. The Generals’
two victories in the meet (over
Villanova 10-7 and Hopkins 18-16
in overtime) were the first two
victories for any fall team.
Drew Pillsbury had seven goals
and Biff Martin three in the first
contest, and Martin came back
with eleven goals in the second
game, while Keith Romich
scored three and Bob Newcomb
and Pillsbury scored two each.

Coach Bill Stearns. cited
teamwork as the key factor in
the victories at Hopkins.
Stearns pointed out that no
starters were lost from last
year’s 11-9 team, and that the
experience of this year’s team
should be its strength. Besides
All-Staters Martin, Romich,
and goalie Will Hodges, the
other returning stafters are
Pillsbury, Newcomb, Mike
Foley, Chip Hoke, and Bill
Meyer. Stearns also is im-
pressed withthe unselfishness
the team has shown so far, and
stressed the importance of a
good passing game against
schools with better swimmers
than the Generals. This game
plan paid off against Hopkins in
the championship game, when
the Generals beat the same
team which won the small col-
lege swimming championships
last year with its passing game.

In identifying the weaknesses
of the team, Sterns was quick to
point out that the Generals lack
depth at every position, and
fatigue could definitely be a fac-
tor when the tournament
schedule starts and the team
plays five games in three days.

Players with little or no ex-
perience in water polo will be
able to gain valuable playing
time as the team approaches
the toughest part of the
schedule. Rookies Aric Johnson
and Herb Gresens have proven
themselves in competition,
though, and several cther less
experienced players will likely
have the same chance before
the season is over.

The team’s next challenge is
the Southern League Tourna-
ment starting Friday night at
W&L, with the Generals taking
on the University of North
Carolina at 7 p.m. in the Cy
Twombly pool. Admission is
free for the entire tournament,
which features UNC, Georgia
Southern, George Washington
University, Duke University,
and East Carolina University.

Saturday at Wilson Field. The
loss, the General’s fourth in a
row, did have a positive side
because W&L may have found
the man to cure their offensive
woes-freshman quarterback
Rich Hachenburg.

Hachenburg, called on to

replace Scott Swope late in the
second quarter, was able to put
together two scoring drives. It
was the first time this year that
the Generals scored two
touchdowns in one game. ‘‘Rich
came in and gave the offense a
real spark’, said Coach Gary
Fallon. ‘“‘He showed great poise
for a freshman under that type
of pressure.”’

Hachenburg’s heroics proved
to be in vain, as the Generals
fell victim to their old nemesis-
the turnover. W&L turned the

ball over six times, including
four fumbles and two intercep-
tions. Three of these turnovers

the Washington and Lee football

Soccer team comes
up short twice

by Tim Connors
Washington and Lee played
Averett College and Eastern
Mennonite College this week,
and in each game came up on
the short side of a 2-0 score.
Although both games were
decided by the same score, each
had a character all its own.

Against Averett, W&L did not
play a_ particularly strong
game. Coach Rolf Piranian felt
that Averett was ‘not very
disciplined, that they only had
one or two good players’ and
that they played as a “‘bunch of
individuals.’’ He was not pleas-
ed with the way his team played

in this game, as W&L was still
unable to give a total team ef-
fort for the entire game.

When the Generals travelled
to Eastern Mennonite on Satur-
day, it was a different story.
Piranian said that E.M.C.,
which sports a 7-1-1 record for
1978, is ‘‘a very good ballclub”’
and he felt that his team
“outplayed and outhustled”
their opponents, but once again
failed to put the ball in the net.
W&L was hurt by an early goal
which resulted from what Pira-
nian called a ‘‘freaky play’’, but
the Generals did not give up,

scene. This bright young force
is freshman quarterback Rich
Hackenburg.

Hachenburg, a graduate of
Miramar High School in
Miramar, Florida, did nothing
more than complete seven of
twelve passes, for 161 yards and
no interceptions, score one
touchdown himself and throw
for another. This all came in
just over two quarters of play.
Hachenburg entered the game
with just 2:36 left in the half. In
his first series as a college

quarterback, he marched the
Generals 64 yards in six plays to
their first touchdown of the
game. Forty-nine of those yards
came off Hachenburg’s arm, in-
cluding the final seven on a TD
pitch to fellow frosh Mike
Fogarty. Midway through the
third period, the young quarter-
back knotted the score at 14
with an ll-yard scramble to
paydirt. Not a bad day for a
freshman.

Hachenburg came to W&L
because of its academics and
because he wanted a chance to
play college football. He
entered summer practices as
one of five freshmen vying for
the backup slot behind senior
quarterback Scott Swope.
Hachenburg never lost his con-
fidence despite the stiff com-
petition and the appearance
that the only role available was
a reserve. He kept a firm grip
on his belief that ‘‘someday I
would get a shot, and that’s all

(continued on page 14)

led to R-MC touchdowns, while
another stopped the Generals

deep in Yellowjacket territory.

It was Swope who threw both
interceptions. One was caused
by a deflected pass at the R-MC
15, while the other was picked
off by Bill Koepsel at thé W&L
45 and returned for a touchdown
and a 7-0) R-MC lead. ‘‘We ex-
ecuted well on the play’’, siad
Fallon, “their defensive back
just made a great play.”

Randolph-Macon’s_ second
touchdown was an eleven play,
49 yard effort that was set up by
Stewart Atkinson’s fumble, the
General’s third turnover, on the
W&L 49. Larry Lant’s four yard
run gave Randolph-Macon a
14-0 lead.

Just when the game seemed
to be a rout, Hachenburg came
in and marched the Generals
downfield on a six play, 64 yard
scoring drive. The freshman
connected with fullback Jim
Palermo for a 42 yard pass and,
four plays later, found tight-end
Mike Fogarty alone in the end
zone for a _ seven yard
touchdown pass. W&L trailed
R-MC 14-7.

In the third quarter, Hachen-
burg was able to repeat his
magic. With the ball on the
Yellowjacket’s 28, the Generals
appeared to be stopped on
downs when Syd Farrat’s punt
was fumbled by Alex McManus
and recovered by W&L at the
Yellowjacket’s five. On third
and goal from the eleven,
Hachenburg swept around left
end and went untouched for six
points. It was tied at 14-14 with
1:20 left in the third quarter.

As was the case in their other
games, the Generals faded fast.
McManus, up to then the goat of
the game because of his fumble,
took a pitchout and scampterd
62 yards for the winning
touchdown. The third quarter
ended on that play, and the
score was R-MC 21, W&L 14.

The fourth quarter was
dominated by Randolph-Macon.
After recovering a Hachenburg
fumble on the W&L 36, the
Yellowjackets used eleven run-
ning plays to gain their fourth
touchdown, with Halfback Mike

Woolfolk scoring from one yard’

out. The Generals made one last
threat but time expired with the
ball on the R-MC 15. The final
score was R-MC 28, W&L 14.

Even though his team is 0-4,

and is about to equal last year’s
team’s record of going 06
before a win, Fallon is not about
to panic. ‘We still haven’t
played the total game we must
to win. Our defense is still hav-
ing to work too much, but our of-
fense is improving with each
game. We're still making
mistakes, but our freshmen
have developed well and things

should turn around soon.”’
W&L plays the Maryville
Scots this Saturday in

Maryville, Tennessee. ‘Their
strength is in their defense,’’
said Fallon. ‘Offensively,
they’re alot like Randolph-
Macon. They have a scrambling
quarterback and a breakaway
runner. We should have our
hands full all day.”’

Tennis team readies for
homecoming tournament

by John Winans

Last weekend the Washington
and Lee tennis team captured
one of three matches and gain-
ed needed experience at the
James Madison Invitational
Tournament.

The Generals showed im-
provement and gained more of
that experience that Coach
Gary Franke cited as necessary
after last weeks’ tourney. The
Generals three opponents were
Madison, Virginia Tech and
University of Richmond. In the
first match they faced the host
team and beat them handily;
7-2. Singles winners against the
Dukes were Stew Jackson,

Shaw Cranfield, Dave Constine,
Pat Norris and Sumner
Bouldin. All-American Stew
Jackson had to bow out from the
next two matches due to illness.

W&L then faced a strong Rich-
mond team, ending up on the
short end in a real thriller, 5-4.
Cranfield, Yonge and Bouldin
were victorious in the singles
category while Norris and
Cranfield teamed up to take

thier doubles match. In the last
match Frankes’ netmen were
beaten by a very tough Virginia
Tech team 7-2. Yonge and
Bouldin out-scored their op-
ponents and notched another

and they continued to apply
pressure. As was the case last
week against Valley United,
W&L outshot E.M.C. 16-14, but
still lost in the first Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference con-
test for both teams. The second
E.M.C. goal came on a penalty-
kick which was awarded on
what Piranian felt was a ‘‘ques-
tionable call by the officials’,
and he felt that this was
E.M.C.’s only serious scoring
threat. The Generals were forc-
ed to play with ten men during
the last part of the game due to
one player being ejected, but
Piranian said that his team
“kept the pressure on, even
though we were a man short”.
The game was an encouraging

sign for the remainder of the
season, as Piranian said that it
was the “first game in which
(the Generals) played well as a
team all season’, and that it
was a “great effort”.

Upcoming for W&L will be a
big game on Saturday at home
against Elizabethan College
and on Wednesday, October 11,

the Generals will meet the ©

University of Richmond. Pira-
nian is looking for the team-
work displayed by W&L in the
E.M.C. game to carry over into
the remaining games on the
schedule.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Faculty follies...

Two weeks ago in this column, readers were in-
formed of the ‘“‘Fancy Dress motion” facing the
University Council. If the motion passed, all Fancy
Dress activities would occur within the Washington
Holiday. We urged students to attend the meeting;
many did, and had the pleasure of seeing it defeated
unanimously. So Fancy Dress reamins a part of the
‘“‘academic year,” like it or not.

In my excitement over the motion, I was certain
that the discussion at the meeting would be fast-paced
and hard-hitting. Unfortunately, the standard was
somewhat lower. For one solid hour, the administra-
tion members of the U.C. kept the sutdents roaring in
laughter as one foot after another entered its respec-
tive mouth.

Professor Beckley, of the religion department, had
the dubious honor of defending the motion single-
handed. (His co-author, Professor Sessions, is no
longer affiliated with the U.C.). Beckley pushed the
idea of removing a ‘“‘temptation’’ from the student
body. And then the fat hit the fire; Professor Gary
Dobbs’ southern eloquence was aroused. ‘‘This is one
further attempt to protect the students from
themselves,”” he said. “This was dying in my
undergraduate days, it’s dead now, and I want no part
of it.”’

As the meeting progressed, the comments grew in-
creasingly bizarre. One student strongly stated, “‘I’ve
learned more during certain parts of Fancy Dress
‘than I’ve ever learned in a classroom.” The faculty
responded in kind: ‘‘That’s unfortunate...you might
as well go to a social club.”’

The essential question was a valid one: can the U.C.
or any other body tell the students how to spend their
time and money? But the common sense of the matter
was lost in the fog of faculty phrases. Perhaps the
greatest of all came from Professor Beckley, in his
search for some precedent of faculty control on
students. “Of course there are things we refuse the
students,” he said. ‘‘I mean, we don’t allow them to
fornicate on the front lawn...”’ (!) If the professor
knows of some side-activity of that sort which has
ever been a real threat, I wish he’d let the rest of us in
on the action...

The debate swirled on—and so did the uncoun-
trollable laughter. One of my favorite lines was
delivered by Carren Kaston of the English depart-
ment, concerning faculty control: ‘‘I hate being an
authoritarian; I just want you to do what I tell you.’’ I
‘don’t think anyone in the room quite figured that one
out...

Soon after, the final vote was taken. The students
trooped out, satisfied with the result—and in posses-
sion of a valuable lesson. For years, many of us have
wished to witness the debates in that bastion of secret
decision-making, the faculty meeting. But if last
week’s U.C. meeting was any indication of the facul-
ty’s oratorical ability, I believe we students would
rather quit while we’re ahead.

Luce
Scholarships

New York City—Fifteen Luce
Scholars, the fifth group chosen
for participation in a program
operated by the Henry Luce
Foundation, arrived in Asia this
week to take up professional in-
ternships in locations that
range from an architect’s office
in Tokyo to a biology laboratory
in central Java. The Scholars
were selected from over 120
candidates nominated last fall
by 60 colleges and universities
across the country, including
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty.
The Luce Scholars Program
was established by the founda-
tion in 1973 to give outstanding
young Americans an exposure
to Asia at an early stage in their
careers.

The competition for 1979-80
Luce Scholars is already under-
way. Nominating institutions
have been asked to present
their candidates to the Henry
Luce Foundation no later than
December 4th. Interested
seniors, graduate of profes-
sional school students, or recent
alumni under the age of 30 are
asked to contact the local Luce
Scholar liaison, Dean Edwin
Craun, for further information.
The foundation emphasizes that
applications submitted directly
to it cannot be considered.

Computer problems

(continued from page 1)
Center when more than eleven
people decide to use the Center
at one time. This often causes a
fifteen minute to an hour delay,
resulting in wasted time.
However, rest assured because
plans are being made to locate
eight more terminals in room
112 of Parmly Hall.

The problem of faculty
children using the computer to
play games can simply be solv-
ed by “bumping” them off the
terminal, Imeson said. The rule
on game playing states that if
class work needs to be done
then the class work takes
precedence. However, by rights
of the university community
and if the children are actually
performing operations with the
computer, then they cannot be
“bumped.’”’’The computer for

the University”

It has been termed “‘the com-
puter for the university’’ by Dr.
Imeson. After a rather lengthy
“suggestion period’ of four
years by the Academic Depart-
ments, the University finally
perceived the need for a new
computer. An initial investiga-
tion showed that there existed
two competative markets:
large computers and small
computers.

However, the  university’s
needs fell somewhere between
the two. There are very few
companies that deal in the im-
termediate range of computers.

The selection committee was
looking for five basic qualifica-
tions: 1) a machine that could
serve both the Academic and
Administrative needs of the
University with a high degree of
ease and accessability in opera-
tion 2) a large ‘on line’
memory 3) a device that utiliz-
ed most of the currently used
high level computer language
4) a cost that was compatable
with the University and 5) at
least seven years of use.

The University decided to buy
a computer as it had done in the
past, because if they were to
rent it each year they would be
paying approximately forty
percent of the initial value. Dr.
Imeson said renting the com-
puter would keep the University
up to date with the constantly
changing world, but W&L has

neither the need nor the ability
to constantly rent a computer.

The selection committee
finally decided on the Harris
Corporation for their computer.
Harris is one of the top com-
panies in the country. The
mother company is best noted
for inter-type, which is the na-
tional standard for newspaper
type.

Harris buys parts form other
companies and assembles them
with their own tape drives, the
mechanism that operates the
memory tapes. However, the
computer is their own deisgn.
When the computer goes
‘“down”’ the Harris people are
there to fix it within a day, but
sometimes it takes them longer
to diagnose the actual problem,
adds Dr. Imeson.

The computer itself is a Har-
ris 125. It consists of two eighty
megabit discs each with a
capacity of processing eighty
million characters of informa-
tion, two magnetic tape drives
to operate the discs, one card
reader, one line printer and a
memory of sixty million
characters.

The computer can handle
most advanced computer pro-
grams with only _ slight
modifications, which means the
university will be in step with
the growing computer sciences
for a while.

Its cost was approximately
300 thousand dollars, totally in-
stalled. However, one-third of
this cost was covered by a grant
from ‘‘The College Association
to Undergraduate Education’’,
which is The National Science
Foundation.

As part of this grant, the
Foundation provices people to
help universitites adapt to the

 

new systems. W&L’s represen-
tative is Mr. Arlon Kemple. He
is now helping to coordinate the
Politics, Economics and Social
Sciences Departments in their
use of the computer.

Runners fall short
twice in tri-meet.

by Greg Branan

Despite another sparkling
first place finish by Washington
and Lee’s Rich Bird, the
General’s cross country team
came out on the bottom of last
weekend’s tri-meet at Virginia
Beach, Va.

Bird, a co-captain, led
throughout the 5.2 mile race. He
finished with a time of 27:27,
more than 30 seconds ahead of
the second place finisher. Bird
had finished in the same man-
ner a week earlier at the Davis
and Elkins meet. The other co-
captain, Bob Bates, was the
harrier in third, with a time of
28:10. W&L’s other scorers
were Greg Branan, Brian
Adams, and Mike Conforti.

Bird commented that the
General’s poor showing could
have been due to ‘‘the fact that
most of the course was flat and
we're not conditioned for runn-

ing on flat ground which re-
quires a strong’ steady pace.”
Such a pace is hard to achieve
when training in the mountains.
In all, ten runners made the
trip to Virginia Beach. The
others were Parker Roberts,
Carlos Solari, Howard Herndon,
Bill Sherwin and Tom Gillen.

Final scores for the Generals
were W&L 33-Norfolk State 24;
W&L 28-Roanoke 27. Scoring is
based on one point per place,
therefore the team with the
lower score wins. When com-
paring two out of three teams,
the third team’s places are ig-
nored and filled in with the two
teams places in order. The first
five men from a team score
points.

Next weekend the Generals
travel back to Virginia Beach to
face Virginia Wesleyan, Lyn-
chburg, Norfolk State and

Christopher Newport.

Rich Hachenburg is a very

aware of his deficiencies. What
he lacks in physical assets, he
makes up for in desire and

understandable though, as the
“B” level program invites a
greater number of Freshman
and Sophomore ‘‘joueur de foot-
ball” to participate on a col-
legiate level than there would
be without such a program.
This in turn affords Coach Pira-
nian a broader selection of
talent to choose from on a year
to year basis, and which in the
end, can only make a better soc-
cer program.

W&L a winning football team.”’
That’s the kind of ball player
Rich Hachenburg is.

Hatchenburg embarks on his
college football career much
like he began his high school
career. He has had experience
in turning around football pro-
grams. His freshman year of
high school, his team registered
a 1-9 mark. His sophmore year
the team improved to 4-7 and
then 7-4 his junior year. As a
senior, he led Miramar High to
a10-0record.

Just talking with Rich
Hachenburg, one gets the
distinct impression that he
would like nothing more than to
pull an encore turnaround per-
formance for W&L. Now that
he’s gotten his shot and made
the most of it, it is time for the:
curtain to rise again on Rich
Hachenburg. Coach Gary
Fallon states this is the case. In
all probability, Hachenburg will
start against Maryville on
Saturday.

Young Republicans

by Kevin Dwyer

“Warner for Senate’’ is not
just a slogan. The W&L
Republican Club is very much
involved in seeing that the
slogan becomes a reality. The
club is working very hard to
carry Rockbridge County and
Lexington and B.V. for Warner.

The Campaign Committee
meets in the Cockpit every
Wednesday afternoon at 4:30
p.m. The first two meetings
have been very successful and
several projects are underway.
Last Friday, with the help of
numerous girls from the Mary
Baldwin CR’s, the club besieged
the Lexington High School
Homecoming Game _ with
Warner literature. Over 900
pieces were passed out. Another
home game at L.H.S. this Fri-
day will hopefully lead to
another blitz.

Every Saturday morning,
from now until the election, the
club will be bumper branding
cars in Lexington area shopping
center parking lots. The first
two outings were excellent.
Anyone interested may meet at
10 a.m. Saturday mornings in
the lobby of the Student Center.

Along with the Rockbridge
County Republican Committee,
the club will be operating night-
ly phone banks from the county
headquarters, located on
Washington Street next to the
Dutch Inn. The purpose of this
is to identify and draw out the
Warner supporters. As John
Warner went to Washington and

Lee and currently sits on our

g GZ a g g Y g

Al tal tal Ge
Hiv} | “J 7]

Board of Trustees, the support
for him in the area is probably
very strong. Anyone interested
in working with any of the
above projects can contact
Kevin Dwyer at 463-3861.

Virginia Republican Senator
William L. Scott was scheduled
to speak to the club at the Oc-
tober General meeting next
week, but his sister passed
away and thus his schedule was
thrown into disarray. Attempts
are being made to obtain a
replacement.

Lone term plans include the
revival of a significant publica-
tion of the club. In addition to
the monthly Tucknewsletter to
members, the club used to
publish a journal of political
thought and commentary, en-
titled the Washington and Lee
Republican Forum. Such
leaders as J. Kenneth Robinson
and Barry Goldwater, Jr. have
been contributors. Chuck Stin-
nett is going to be the Editor of
this year’s edition, which will
hopefully appear in January.

Over half of freshmen
pledged to fraternities

by Charles Tucker

More than half of this year’s
freshman class has_ pledged
fraternities, according to Inter-
fraternity Council President
Jim Davis.

The report was issued by
Davis at an IFC meeting Tues-
day night, one day after
freshmen submitted their
preference cards to the council.

Also at the meeting, each
fraternity president reported
the number of freshmen his
house counted as_ pledges.
Sigma Phi Epsilon had the
largest number with 25. Pi Kap-
pa Phi and Sigma Chi were se-
cond with 23 pledges each. Kap-
pa Alpha, Lamba Chi, and Phi
Gamma Delta were tied for
third with 20 apiece.

Contact receives $4,500

In other business Tuesday
night, the IFC passed a motion
to grant $4,500 to the Contact
committee—a $500 increase
over the amount allotted last
year. The increase in funds was
necessitated by the rising fees
demanded by speakers.

Concerning Homecoming
weekend, Davis urged the
fraternities to use discretion in
regard to the length and loca-
tion of their parties.

He asked that parties
scheduled after the Student Ac-
tivities Board’s concert Friday
night be confined to fraternity
basements, and he reminded
the presidents that no Sunday
parties may be held at the
fraternity houses.

Noise ordinance

Davis announced that a deci-
sion was expected from the Lex-
ington City Council next Thurs-
day night on the IFC proposals
to limit partying in return for a
“relaxation”’ of the city’s noise
ordinance.

The IFC had offered to limit
weekday parties to just
Wednesday nights and ending
at midnight, and to have
weekend parties end at 1 a.
In addition to being lible to th
city for violations of the tim
restrictions, fraternities woul
also be subject to a fine fro
the IFC and, possibly, a revoc
tion of partying privileges.

The proposals were submi
ted to the City Council sever
weeks ago.

$100 fines for contact in the
freshman dorms _ between
freshmen and fraternity
members during a ‘“‘no- con-
tact’’ period

“‘Ungentlemanly conduct”’ on
the part of two members of
Delta Tau Delta resulted in a
$100 fine for that fraternity. A
complaint by members of Lam-
ba Chi, where the incident oc-
curred, prompted the action.

According to one member of
Lamba Chi, who was somewhat
reluctant to discuss the inci-
dent, junior Angus Finney and
sophomore John Boger, both

‘Delts, were ‘‘dirty-rushing
girls” at a party at the Lamba
Chi house approximately three
weeks ago.

Boger stated that he and Fin-
ney were told to leave the party
when members of Lamba Chi
“got mad at us because we were
talking to girls.”’ After being
asked by the president of Lam-
ba Chi, Boger said that he and
Finney promptly left.

Finney and Boger intend to
appeal the IFC’s decision.

memorable experience of this
weekend’s Homecoming
festivities will be the selection
of Washington and Lee’s
Homecoming Queen.

The judging process. will
begin at 3 p.m. Friday when
each contestant is interviewed
for approximately 10 minutes.
Balloting for the winner will be

As is tradition, Dr. James K.
Shillington will crown this
year’s winner and her court
with the style and flair that has
become his trademark. For this
reason, the Ring-tum Phi inter-
viewed Dr. Shillington about his
thoughts on Homecoming and
his unique role in the crowning
ceremonies.

Question: Dr. Shillington, just
how many Washington and Lee
Homecoming Queens have you

crowned?
Shillington: According to my
records, I started in 1963. I think
that’s all of them; every year
since then I’ve been crowning
Homecoming Queens.

Q: In your opinion, have the
girls been getting better look-
ing, are we getting higher quali-
ty nominees?
Shillington: No, I think they’re
about the same. How could one
see improvement? Human be-
ings are human beings.
Q: Well, I meant aesthetically.
Shillington: Obviously there’s
ups and downs in aesthetics.
Some years there are very
beautiful ones and some years
there aren’t. How can you tell
until you see the crop?
Q: In your mind has W&L ever
picked a Homecoming Queen
who was undeserving of the
honor?
Shillington: Oh, gallantry for-
bid!
Q: Do you see a pattern in a cer-
tain fraternity that can pick the
beauties year after year?

Shillington: I don’t think so. I
think the honor has moved
around quite a lot.

I really haven’t seen any
trend of any kind. One year

college goes, I haven’t seen any
lasting drift from one girl’s
school to the next.

Q: Do you forsee another goed

Shillington: I have nothing to
lose but to gain, I think.

Q: Why did you leave the judg-
ing process?

Shillington: Well, that got com-

Purvis cleared of charges

The Lexington Police Depart-
ment cleared officer Jack Pur-
vis of the charges brought
against him by Washington and
Lee senior Bill Tucker for his
conduct during Tucker’s arrest
on charges of speeding and
driving under the influence of
alcohol on the morning of
August 31.

In his letter to Tucker, Police
Chief James A. Kirby quoted
from the final paragraph of the,
investigating officer’s report:
“During my investigation,
which was thorough and com-
plete, I could not find anything
that proved Sergeant Purvis
conducted himself in an un-
professional manner regarding
this incident. I feel that
Sergeant Purvis should be
cleared of the allegations plac-
ed against him by William B.-
Tucker on September 25, 1978.”

Kirby said in the same letter
that he ‘‘concurred”’ with the in-
vestigating officer’s report. The
investigation of the complaint
was conducted by Lt. B. M.
Beard.

When Tucker went to court on
the charges, the driving under
the influence charge was
dismissed and the speeding was
reduced from 41 m.p.h. to 34
m.p.h. ina 25m.p.h. zone.

Asked for his reaction to the
conclusions of the police in-
vestigation, Tucker said,” I
asked Chief Kirby to investigate
the matter to his satisfaction
and decided in advance to agree
to any decision that was made. I
was disappointed that his letter
did not address any of the

specific points that my com-
plaint raised, but I am ap-
preciative of the time and effort
that the investigation required
and of the willingness of Chief
Kirby to consider the matter.’’
“Tam clear in my mind of the
sequence of events and realize
the limitations of an informa-
tion gathering process if that in-
formation is based on word

against word,”’ Tucker said.

“T feel that I was possibly
harrassed by an officer on that
night, but am eager to forget
the incident and return back to
my studies,” he continued.

Tucker then asked if ‘‘anyone
would like to purchase a late
model Chevolet with Texas
plates for a reasonable price?”’

KAs would win, I would be ac-.

cused of tilting the whole thing.
It seemed to me it was fairer
if I did not do the judging. I sup-
pose since I’ve stopped dining
with them that I might well
start again, but I don’t think I
will.
Q: But don’t you think the judg-
ing process might be enhanced
by your experience?

Shillington: I doubt it. I doubt it.

The Student Activities Board
has been the object of much
criticism over the past few
years because of the quality and
type of concerts they sponsor.
Some people are dissatisfied
with the bands brought here;
others are sure that better

bands could play here wichout
overturning the budget.

According to Mike Cappeto,
head of the University Center,
there are four types of bands:
First, there are the up-and-
coming or the over-the-hill acts
which often play at fraternity
houses. Examples of these
bands would be Bryce Street
and the Drifters, both of which
will appear for less than two
thousand dollars. A more ex-
pensive (approximately
seventy-five hundred dollars)
category of artists is the one
from which performers are
habitually drawn for concerts.
They would include Harry
Cahpin, the Atlanta Rhythm
Section and Orleans.

Bands in the third category
very rarely come here. The

Spinners are in this group. The
expense for this type of group is
from ten to fifteen thousand
dollars which is beyond the per-
missable except on rare occa-
sions. The entire budget for the
SAB is $30,000.

The final groups are in the
“big name” category. Groups
like Fleetwood Mac, et al. hard-
ly ever play colleges because it
does them no good. When they
go on tour, (usually three times
a year for from three to twelve
weeks), they would want to pro-
mote their albums, travel com-
fortably and make money. As a
result, they play large cities
where the publicity potential is
very good.

Scheduling is another pro-,
blem that the SAB faces. Under

Cappeto comments on SAB bands

last year’s new rules put for-
ward by the E.C., the SAB has
to hold public meetings while
deliberating about bands. For
this reason, many opportunities
are lost. Bill Tucker, last year’s
co-chairman of the SAB and
current Vice-President of the
E.C., said, “‘I think that the co-
chairmen should be able to look
at a band without a public
meeting if the merits of that
band and student opinion have
been adequately discussed.”

To summarize, expecting big
name bands to come here
seems an exercise in futility.
Also, smaller but more frequent
concerts appear to be the trend.
Even so, if the factions among

‘the student body ever get

together, we might have a fan-
tastic year.

WE&L freshmen at |
the R:E'L: Hotel

by Ray McNulty

Because of a very large
freshman class, Wahington and ,
Lee University is forced to
house freshmen in an_ off-
campus hotel.

The second and third floors of
the Robert E. Lee Hotel now
serve as a dormitory for the
group of W&L freshmen. The
hotel is located on Main Street
in Lexington, three blocks from
the W&L campus.

The 31 freshmen are under
the tuidance of dorm counselors
Keith Romich and Kevin
McGowan. The freshmen share
the hotel with a group of 15
elderly people who live on the
fourth and sixth floors. Four-
teen W&L upperclassmen have
rooms on the fifth floor.

Dorm Counselor Kevin
McGowan said that most of the
freshmen were “‘reluctant and
pessimistic” about living in the
hotel when they first arrived in
Lexington. He said now that
they have lived there for a few
weeks they all prefer living in
the ‘‘Robert E. Lee.”’

When asked if there were any
problems with the unusual
situation between college
freshmen and the elderly people
living in the hotel, McGowan
said that there have not been
any problems so far and he feels
he has a solution should a pro-
blem arise. ‘‘Quiet hours’’ in the
hotel are on weeknights starting
at 7:30 p.m. until 9 a.m. There
are no quiet hours on weekends.

McGowan’s solution to the
possible conflict with the elder-
ly neighbors is to develop some
kind of friendship with them. He
has all of hiXfreshmen talking
to the older folks whenever they

‘ The freshmen liked their larger

see them in their spare time.
McGowan said that the
freshmen plan to have a Bingo
session for the older folks
sometime around the
Thanksgiving holiday.

The freshmen living ‘in the
hotel seem to get along very
well. They have all donated
money for a hall refrigerator.
McGowan said that in their
spare time the freshmen usual-
ly play cards and drink beer.
“It’s a really close-knit group)’
said McGowan, “It’s like a
fraternity.”

The freshmen at the ‘‘Robert
E. Lee’’ are also planning a
‘hall party’? with one of the
dorm sections at Sweet Briar. A
cookout on the balcony of the
hotel is also a possibility for
later in the semester.

McGowan said that he has not
had any trouble with the
freshmen so far. ‘“They’re a lit-
tle rowdy, but they know when
they can fool around and when
they can’t,” he said.

All of the freshmen interview-
ed said they liked living in the
hotel and enjoyed their unusual
situation. The only complaint
was about the “‘long walk to the
gymnasium and dining hall.”’

rooms with the additional lux-
ury of private baths. ‘‘At least
you don’t wake up to a cold
floor,’ said one freshman.
Another freshman said that the
girls who came to visit liked the
hotel rooms much more than
the dorm rooms.

Ejay Clark, a freshman who ~
lived in the dorms for two weeks
during summer football prac-
tice, said that there’s no com-
parison between the rooms.
“This is a lot better,” said

Clark.

This is not the first time that
W&L freshmen have had to live
in the Robert E. Lee Hotel. The
same situation occured two
years ago when the freshmen
class was too large for the dor-
mitories. The situation worked
out well then and it appears that
history will repeat itself this
year.

E.C. appropriates
no money

by Randy Smith

The Executive Committee ap-
propriated no money at their
meeting Monday night.

A request was heard from a

_ new film society for over $1,000
to finance four very ‘‘special’’
films, however.

Jay Diesing, a spokesman for
the group, submitted a ‘‘ten-
tative’’ budget to the E.C. so the
committee could ‘‘consider the

price of the films and the type of
films we are interested in show-
ing.”’

Among the films listed by the
group were: Cries and
Whispers by Bergman, Day for
Night by Truffaut, and Love
and Arnarchy by Wertmuller.

Carren Kaston, assistant pro-
fessor of English and organizer
of the film society, told the E.C..,

Rupert Latture:
A Tradition of Service

by Ned McDonnell

Many of us feel a twinge of college pride when
we think of Rupert Latture, the very warm yet en-
ticingly aloof gentleman who works in the
anteroom of President Huntley’s office. Not only
the witness of events dating back some six
decades, the man himself is one of W&L’s pro-
udest traditions.

Mr. Latture symbolizes a rarely seen but
stimulating mixture of traditionalism and in-
dependent thinking, of idealism without illusions,
and most of all (and most difficult for me as the in-
terviewer ), of a strong and sincere humility.

From Latture and his co- founders, Omicron
Delta Kappa next took root in Johns Hopkins
University and then beyond to the University of
Pittsburgh. From these beginnings, the
honorary fraternity has established itself in the
furthest reaches of the nation, at 250 or more
schools. But, throughout this prosperous growth,
neither W&L nor Rupert Latture have faded into
ODK obscurity. When the school’s bicentennial
rolled around in 1949, ODK honored the event by
constructing the circular memorial by the supp-
ly store—another design by Latture. This time,
the older but every bit as enthusiastic Latture

didn’t have to contend with a boring philosophy
class but an obstinate W&L ODK president who
wanted the circular bench elsewhere. Latture
won out and the construction began in 1950. The.
national ODK remembered W&L once again in‘
1964, the fraternity’s fiftieth anniversary, by
placing a plaque honoring the founders in Wahs-
ington Hall.

 

By fusing these various qualities into a rarely
failing energy, Mr. Latture has done much over
the years to make life at W&L more fulfilling for.
him...and for us. The most evident Latture con-
tribution is, of course, Omicron Delta Kappa. Bet-

W&L, Mr. Latture, along with his roommate and
“warm friend’’ J. Carl Fischer, concocted after
many conversations the idea for this contributory
organization. As Mr. Latture himself says, ‘“‘We
were both idealistic in that we wanted to make a
contribution to the improvement of life for the stu-
dent body and of value to the University.” To
fulfill this dream, the two young men gathered
with them ten fellow students, two faculty
members, and the president of the University to
launch ODK.

The charter members started a fraternity to
honor and coordinate different types of leadership
on campus. These leaders, (from scholastics,
athletics, public speaking, publications, and the
arts) in the junior and senior classes were tapped
into the feldgling honor society. ‘By bringing
together leaders of these different phases of stu-
dent life,’ Latture recalls, ‘‘they could form a new
and exciting group.’’A few faculty members were
included to keep the merger of these spheres of
campus activities from falling apart under the
strains of divergent interests.

The young Latture, pressed for time and bored
by a philosophy class, designed the ODK key by
using the outline of two different coins, unequal in
size, as his drawing tools and a post card announc-
ing a YMCA (of which he was president in his
years here as a student) meeting as the paper. Ap-
parently, Mr. Latture used the coins effectively
for his design was selected over several others at
the next ODK meeting.

Behind the more conspicuous accomplishment
of being a principal founder of ODK, one finds a
humble man who has, (as Bill Buckley says of
his old school) ‘‘an almost irrational fondness”’
for Washington and Lee. After serving in France
during the Frist World War as an interpreter for

 

 

disassociated from their university, and the
more modern student body and administration.

Over the years, Rupert Latture has seen
Washington and Lee evolve from a small isolated
college of about six hundred students to a
radically different school today. Gone are the
days, now fond memories of Mr. Latture, of crew
races on the Maury during the Commencement
Exercises for the entertainment of the parents of
graduating seniors. The boarding houses of the
early years of this century which served students
like him are now only a murky spectre in the
minds of a few alumni. Rupert Latture saw the
end of the boarding houses come in the twenties
with the advent of the residential fraternity
system started by Beta Theta Pi around
1920-1922. The Saturday night meetings of the
Graham-Lee and of the Washington Literary
Societies (public speaking clubs) have withered
away in the face of increased student mobility
and road trips.

But Rupert Latture has not lamented the
changes — except for a decline in the dressing
tastes of the students. But, in light of the swing
back to more conservative dress in the last cou-
ple of years, Mr. Latture happily jests that there
is still hope for a dapper student body reminis-
cent of the 1930s... Otherwise, Mr. Latture
observes the changes during his sixty three
years in Lexington with his characteristic
stocism: ‘Some ways are better and some ways
may not be; I don’t really care because | take
things the way they come.” Of al) the people on
this campus, he can afford to feel confident and

to teach French but, from 1924 until his ‘official’
retirement in 1962, he taught Politics. Since 1962,
Mr. Latture has served as special aide to the
president.

The History of W&L’s computer

Second In A Series

by Stuart Snyder
At this time the campus com-
puter is used for a number of
jobs, from academics to admis-
sions. So, whether a student is
in Accounting, Chemistry,
Economics, or Politics, he will
run into the computer. Each
department utilizes the com-

puter ina different way.

For example, the Politics
Department programs the com-
puter with information from
previous elections such as: ef-
fects of the unions on an elec-
tion, the politician’s
background, and the results of
the election. The student then
analyzes this data and forms his
own conclusions about how and
why the voters voted a specific
way. Thus, with the aid of the
computer he arrives at the con-
clusion in a much shorter period
than was the case with the old
computer.

On the other hand, the
Chemistry Department
employs the computer to
calculate various complex pro-
blems.

The Administration uses the
computer for materials from
Admissions, Alumni, Business,
Buildings and Grounds and the
Registrar’s Office. It makes
your schedule and even records
your grades! All together it has
a much greater capacity than
the obselete IBM1130 and
PDP8E, the former work
horses.

A unique feature of the com-
puter is the ability to program
games into the memory. By giv-
ing the computer the correct
user number, which acts as a

pass word, everyone can play
any of the three games now in
the memory.

The games include: Adven-
ture, Hangman, and Market.
Adventure is a_ unique
underground adventure in
which the player commands the
computer through an
underground maze of surprises.

Hangman is a word guessing
game in which the computer
gives the player a word without
the letters. The object is to get
the word in three to ten guesses.
The player sets his own guess-
ing limits.

Market is a game simulation
of the stock market in which the
player is-given: six stocks and
their prices, $10,000 to buy the
stocks, and thirty ‘‘days’’ to
make a fortune.

There are other games plann-
ed for the near future. For all
fans, Star Trek is very much
alive. A game by that name is to
be unveiled soon

History

Computers have been at W&L
since the university acquired an
IBM 1620 in 1961. Back then
there was no need for a large
computer; it was used strictly
for the academic and ad-
ministrative needs of the
university.

In 1968 the university pur-
chased an IBM 1130, which was
a little larger in capacity, This
machine is still being used until
all the Administrative  in-
formation can be transferred to
the new computer. During

1970 the university bought from

The PDP8E was finally put
out of public use after the Har-
ris 125 replaced it. It is now

Department.

FUTURE

According to Dr. Imeson it is
hard to predict the ultimate use
for the computer, but he men-
tioned one certain result.There
will be a general increase in
users, not so much an increase
of various programs as an in-
crease in users. The degree of

this is dependent upon the in-
dividual teaching techniques
that the faculty will choose to
follow.

Mr. Kemple adds that the

future faculty use of the com-
puter will probably be along the
lines of teaching, where the stu-
dent will go to the terminal and
receive individual instruction in
ithe course he is taking.

Homecoming
Brings Bands

by Spencer Leffel

A variety of live music is
scheduled for this Homecoming
Weekend, with two bands slated
for Friday night, October 13,
and -another scheduled for
Saturday afternoon, October 14.

The Student Activities Board
will feature Song Bird, a rock
band, and The Impressions, a
soul band, in Doremus Gym-
nasium at 8 p.m. on Saturday.

Song Bird, a versatile group
from the Carolinas, will lead-off
Friday night’s concert. Featur-
ing a three-piece horn section,
the band plays not only rock and
roll, but funk, funk-jazz and
discoas well. —

Besides the origanal material
it performs, Songbird’s sources
for its music vary from ZZ Top
and Eagles to the Crusaders
and Earth, Wind and Fire. ;

The Impressions will headline
Friday night’s show. An
established soul act, the Im-
pressions are a vocal group of
the Motown shcool.

Both groups were among the
most expensive considered by
the §.A.B. Admission to the con-
cert is free. No alcoholic
beverages will be permitted in-
side the gym, and plice officers
will be present. to enforce the
‘dry rule.

Traum plays Cockpit

Happy Traum will appear in
the Cockpit on Wednesday
night, October 25. To most peo-
ple involved in the music scene,
his is a familiar name. His vast
experience in the world of folk,
blues, and country music, and
his versatility as a singer, in-
strumentalist and songwriter,
have brought him critical ac-
claim across the U.S., England,
Europe, and Japan. This past
summer he toured all the major
cities of Europe. In addition to
his recordings and concert ap-
pearances (both solo and with
the Woodstock Mountain
Review), you've heard his
guitar and banjo backing up
Bob Dylan, Jean Ritchie, John
Sebastion and others, and seen

him name on over a dozen best’

selling guitar instruction books.
One of the most popular of these
books is Bluegrass Guitar,
published by the Oak
‘ Publishing company, but also
popular are his instructional
books for beginning guitarists,
especially children ...For years
he contributed a regular col-
umn in Guitar Player

STATE THEATRE

Magazine, illustrating many ex-
amples of guitar techniques and

styles. He has also established °

Homespun Tape Service which
features lessons on guitar (folk,
flatpick, country blues, bot-
tleneck/ slide, lead, and finger-
picking!), Jew’s’ harp,
bluegrass and country fiddle,

. five-string banjo, bluegrass
mandolin, blues/rock piano,

Apocalypse Now which will sup-

‘“‘on the scene” point of view.
Currnetly the big one is Who'll

lot to do with Vietnam, Who'll
Stop The Rain takes us a step
further by becoming a thriller
in its own right, surpassing its
roots in Vietnam-era sentiment.

Nick Nolte churns out a fine
performance as the marine in

It is not uncommon for the
Bookstore to receive requests
for these kinds of ‘‘study aids.”’
This usually occurs as exams
rise up near and large. But this
year students and cadets have
already begun asking for them.
The cold breath of grades, like
the frosty air outside, seems to
have sharpened early this Oc-
tober.

The volume of reading in
many courses appears to loom
like an avalanche. The number
of pages to be read in a random

selection of required texts
shows a span from 400 to 4,000
pages per course. Time for a se-
cond reading? Time to stop for
thought or wonder? No: more
pages to be turned. Is the range
of experience broad enough to
find bright links with the vistas
on the printed page? So it is not
at all unnatural to want to seek
what others have written about
a particular book. Especially
when a cold-eyed dean of ad-
missions at a law school, say,
may someday look hard at that

damn grade.

the glory.)

However it seems to me that
‘‘study-aids’”’ give pre-chewed,
pre-digested, low-protein food
for thought. There is little to
chew on, little to provide
energy, and very little to grow
on. Junk foods. Hence our reply
to those requests: ‘‘We only
serve it straight here.’’ So, risk
the grade, take a big breath,

Despite a poor audience turnout, the Doobie |
Brothers managed to put on one of the better
rock and roll shows I’ve seen in recent months
last Thursday at the Roanoke Civic Center. The
reasons for the low attendance (the place was
half full at the most) are a bit hard to fathom- the
Doobies played about this time last year to an ex-
cellent crowd. I’d be tempted to guess that it’s
because the band’s last record, Livin’ on the
Fault Line, was a commercial failure compared
to their previous efforts. Most importantly, it
had no monster hit singles, and Roanoke fans are

nothing if not singles-oriented.

The show began pretty much on time with an
‘opening set from British hard rockers UFO: A-
Plus For effort, B for instrumental talent, and
the big D for quality of material. This band’s
songs just didn’t cut it for the most part, and
despite the fact that they performed the sort of
sledgehammer rock ‘n roll that I’ve seen go over
well in Roanoke, UFO’s reception was lukewarm

at best.

AREOSMITH

For the first time in nearly two years, Aerosmith

sellout, and this one should be the same despite a

Sculptor visits W&L

by Don Noble

W&L was visited this week by
H.I. Gates, the artist whose
sculpture is currently on exhibit
in duPont Gallery. Aside from
attending the opening reception
on Tuesday, Mr. Gates spoke to
several of the art classes about
his work.

Mr. Gates received his
bachelors and masters degrees
form the University of Illinois
and is currently an assistant
professor of sculpture at
George Washington University
in D.C.

He has shown his work for the
past 20 years throughout the
U.S. and in Europe, and has
won many prizes and awards.
Mr. Gates was trained during
the era of abstract expre-
sionism and consequintly began
his career by showing works in
this style.

Although he was successful,
he felt that this was not for him
because it was an imitation of
another artist’s style. Thus he
set out to discover an art form
which could convey his own
ideas.

Content is important

Gates feels that technique is
not that important; that content
is the most important aspect of
an artists work. ‘An artist
should be in search of subject
matter. He should have his own
statement—something he wants
to say.”” He believes that his
abstract expressionist work
‘thad no where to go because it
was taken out of context.” The
great change in Gates’ work
took place when he moved to
Maryland. He had always been
fascinated by ruins and decay-
ing structures.

One day while walking in the
woods, he discovered a ruined
pre-Revolutionary War iron
works. This structure inspired
him to develop the art form
which he uses today. His first
works in this style, such as the
furnace and fortress series,
tried to suggest the essence of
these objects. They are not sup-
posed to look exactly like ruins,
but instead to convey the feeling
of them.

sculptures used iron plates \in

from his main theme.

turned of by different things.

I’m turned on by rusting
locomotives and _ ruined
factories— by the essence that
exists around these places. I’m

ing motifs which can be found in
them, which progress through
the various stages of his art.

But perhaps most interesting
is seeing the products of an ar-
tist’s imagination over a 16 year
period of his lifeSeeing how the
styles and techniques have
changed as he has expressed his
personal statement in many dif-
ferent ways.

DAVE EDMUNDS: TRACKS
ON WAX4
Swan Song SS8505

Dave Edmunds has for many
years been the inspirational
father figure and guilding force
behind the British rock revival
(or ‘‘power pop,’’ as it has come
to be called) scene. He, even
more than Nick Lowe, is
responsible for the recent suc-
cesses of such artists as
Graham Parker and Elvis
Costello. An accomplished
guitarist, singer and producer,
he has been making highly
entertaining records of his own
for the past 10 years, en-
compassing everything from
rockified versions of classical
themes to Dylan covers to
recreations of old Phil Spector
productions. |

The key to Edmunds’ talent is
that, despite the inherently

derivative nature of his
material, he has always manag-
ed to maintain a careful distinc-
tion between impersonation and
mere imitation. He has an un-
canny ability to recreate the
sound of almost any significant
slice of rock’n’roll history, be it

‘rockabilly, high pop a-la the

Four Seasons, or his all-time
favorite, Chuck Berry. His
records have always been great
fun, but he consistently leaves
me with the nagging feeling
that some crucial element (the
spark of originality, perhaps?)
is missing.

All this goes by way of in-
troducing his latest album,
“Tracks on Wax 4’’. Perhaps it
shouldn’t be surprising, con-
sidering the recent failures of
Edmunds alumnae Parker and
Costello, that Dave’s newest ef-
fort is also probably his weakest
to date. Whatever the reason,

the material (which, for a
change, is mostly original) is
distinctly substandard, and the
arrangements frequently sound
hackneyed, something I never
thought about any of Edmunds’
previous albums. On the other
hand, the production is magnifi-
cent, and there are a few killer
cuts, mostly notably ‘‘Reader’s
Wives” and’It’s My Own
Business,’’ an obscure Chuck
Berry tune. For pure fun, Dave
Edmunds still can’t be beat, but
be forewarned that there are a
few more weak spots than usual
this time around.

Nolte attacks this final, lone

Michael Moriarty and Tues-

their roles as the husband and

crooks and crooked cops.
Moriarty, through a large part
of the film, seems wooden and
incapable of showing emotion,
but his placid facade eventually
reveals a painful concern for his
heroin and his friends. Weld af-

the final scenes. One supposes
that the sadistic policemen
were provided for comic relief,
but their Cheech and Chong
routine is played out much too
long.

The above facotrs contribute
to bring the film down, but all is
not lost. Who'll Stop the Rain is
untimately saved by its direc-
tor, Karel Reisz. His deep-
focus, wide-angle style allows
the viewer to experience the
most mediocre scenes with new
enthusiasm. A grey-toned color
treatment gives the film a stark
edge of reality, while the well
controlled camera motion
smoothes out the rough spots in
scripting. yi

Finally, Who'll Stop the Rain

becomes a_ satisfying film
because of its technical
superiority. This, combined

with Nolte’s riveting per-
formance at least gives the film
an edge over the rest of its
lackluster competition.

paper on Chinese
foreign policy

A research article by a
Washington and Lee University
political scientist on the role of
multi-national corporations in
the formulation of mainland
China’s foreign policy has been
published in the new issue of
“Asian Survey,”’ a scholarly
journal of contemporary Asian
studies.

The article is by Dr. John R...

Handelman, assistant professor
of politics and East Asian
specialist at W&L. His article,

“Penetrating the Bureaucracy:

of the Chinese People’s
Republic: The Role of * Non-
National Actors,” attempts to
assess the degree to which non-
governmental figures influence
official foreign policy, with par-
ticular attention to the develop-
‘ment of the Chinese petro-

chemical industry.

Handelman will also deliver a
paper on a similar topic at the
annual meeting of the Southern
Political Science Association
next month in Atlanta. In his
paper, “China’s Compatibility
Within a Comparative Foreign-
Policy Framework,’ he ex-
amines the extent to which
China is behaving in a more
“ordinary”’ fashion.

Handelman, who holds a
Ph.D. is from Syracuse Univer-
sity and has undertaken post-
doctorate study in Asian politics
under a grant to W&L from the
Mary Babcock Reynolds Foun-
dation, teaches courses in
American foreign policy and in-
ternational relations as well as

‘in Asian politics.

W&L goes 0-5
in football

by Bill Whalen

The Washington and Lee

worse last Saturday when they

The Generals, now 0-5 on the
year, played their most listless
game of the season, and if this
game was any indication of
what the future holds, then W-L
will finish 0-10.

Against Maryville, the
Generals were plagued by the
same two basic problems-a lack
of offense and a defense that
played well but could not pro-
vide any spark. “Our team
wasn’t mentally prepared for
this game’’, said Coach Gary

Fallon. ‘Our attitude was -

wrong and we didn’t play well.”

Particularly disappointing
was the play of quarterback
Rich Hachenburg. In his first
career start, Hachenburg com-
pleted three of eight passes for
22 yards and one interception,
while W-L was being shut-out
for the first time this year. “Our
offense needs more consisten-
cy,” said Fallon. ‘We need
more consistency in our passing

game, and our quarterbacks
must produce more points.”’

The offense was so flat that
Fallon tried three
quarterbacks and none were ef-
fective. Scott Scope, replacing
Hachenburg, completed one of
four passes for seven yards,
while Randy Austin’s: lone
throwing attempt was_ in-
tercepted. Overall the quarter-
backs were four of thirteen, for
29 yards and two interceptions.

The two interceptions, along
with two fumbles, gave the
Generals four turnovers for the
day, and 17 in their last three
games. “I feel that the tur-
novers are preventing us from
winning.’’ said Fallon.
‘‘Whenever we turn it over, we
stop our momentum and place
more pressure on our defense.”’

The defense has been playing
well under this ‘‘pressure,”’
however. Against Maryville,
the W-L defense allowed only
two touchdowns and 178 total
yards, but, more importantly,
they avoided their usual ‘‘one-
play lapse’? (when they allow
the opposition a long yardage
touchdown). However, Fallon
was not too impressed with his
defense’s performance. “They
used a second-string quarter-
back and ran a cautious offense,
but they still controlled the
ball’, said Fallon.

With five games played, the
Generals are halfway through
this season. With their 0-5
record, W-L has very little to be
pleased about, but this year’s
team is a victim of cir-
cumstance. Having a new coach
means having to learn a new
system, which puts all the
players <: the same disad-

Water polo Generals go
6-1 after tournament

The Washington and Lee
Water Polo Generals raised
their 1978 season record to 6-1
after a sterling performance
this weekend in Cy Twombly
Pool. In the first Southern
League Tournament, W&L
played five games in forty
hours, winning four and losing
one. Ten teams competed in the
tournament, and the team
championships went to East
Carolina and Richmond, who
each won five games and lost
none.

Coach Bill Stearns calls the
team his best ever, and has high
hopes for them as the season
wears on. He was extremely
pleased with the way his
starters held up during the five-
game span, and commended

calls his team ‘‘the best ever.”’

Washington and Lee’s water polo team

the play of his defense, led by
Will Hodges in goal, Chip Hoke,
Bob Newcomb, and Mike Foley.

In the tournament opener last
Friday, W&L got off to a great
start as they soundly whipped
North Carolina 27-5, with co-
captains Drew Pillsbury and
Keith Romich scoring seven
and five goals respectively.
Romich came back with two
goals Saturday morning as
W&L defeated Georgia
Southern 6-4. Also Saturday,
Bob Newcomb had five goals
and Biff Martin four as W&L
beat George Washington 14-5,
and Romich finished off his
busy evening with three goals
as Duke fell, 4-3. This last game
was not finished until after mid-
night.

Sunday, the Generals drop-

came out of the weekend tourney with a record of 4-1. Stearn

ped their final game 10-9 to East
Carolina in a very fine effort for
the tired swimmers. W&L lost
to the same team by 13 goals
last year, so the improvement
of this years’ team is evident.
Martin contributed four goals in
the ECU loss.

The team’s next action is
another Southern League tour-
nament October 20-21, when the
Generals will play the other
four teams in the league: VMI,
Lynchburg, James Madison,
and Richmond. If the Generals
can do well in this tourney, they
will qualify for the league’s
championship tournament in
Richmond, October 27-28,
where the top two teams qualify
for the Eastern Collegiate
Championships at West Point,
N.Y.

Saturday’s meet in Norfolk,
Virginia, the Generals manag-
ed their first victory of the
season.

The mix up occurred after a
member of the host team cut
the course and them missed a
turn. In cutting the course, Bird
and another runner were in se-
cond and third following the op-
ponent. Bird commented, “It
was his course, we thought he
knew it.’’ The runner missed a
turn, leading the other two off
course. When Bird finally
returned to the course, he was
in twelfth place. He finished in
seventh place, two places
behind the General’s top runner
of the day, Bob Bates.

Final scores for the meet
were Virginia Wesleyan College
120, Christopher Newport Col-
lege 101, Washington and Lee
57, Norfolk State College 46, and
in first place, Lynchburg Col-
lege with 35.

In all, seven runners made
the trip. Those scoring for W&L
in addition to Bates and Brid
were Greg Branan, Brian

Adams, and Mike Conforti. The
two other strong finishers were
Parker Roberts and Carl
Solari. ;

On Tuesday, October 10, the
Generals traveled to Liberty
Baptist College in Lynchburg
for another meet. Despite tak-
ing their full compliment of run-
ners, Washington and Lee was
defeated 21-38.

Placing second overall and
first for the Generals, was co-
captain Bird. Bates, the other
co-captain, finished sixth
overall and second for the
Generals. Completing the five
scorers were Branan, Conforti,
andRoberts.

Other finishers were Carlos
Solari, Howard Herndon, Bill
Sherwin, Sean Smith, Doug
Shipman, and Tom Gillen.

On Saturday, October 14, the
Generals will have their first
and only home meet of the
season. Scheduled to begin just
before the football game, the
opponents include Bridgewater,
Roanoke, and Eastern Men-
nonite.

Soccer team loses twice,
gears for Homecoming game

by Tim Connors
Washington & Lee played two
tough teams this week, and in
both games gave impressive
performances. These per-
formances are indicative of the
improvement which the team

has made over the course of the
season.
Last Wednesday, the

Generals travelled to
Hampden-Sydney and tied the
Tigers 0-0 in double overtime.
W&L outshot Hampden-Sydney

by the amazing margin of 41-21.
Two of the Generals’ goals were
disallowed by the referees
because of penalties. Coach
Rolf Piranian said that W&L
played a ‘“‘very good ballgame’”’
and that ‘‘We were very
unlucky not to have won that
game.’’ Sophomore goalkeeper
Kevin Carney had 19 saves in
the game en route to picking up
his first shutout of the season.
On Saturday W&L hosted
Elizabethtown College and lost

by the score of 4-0. Losing to the
Blue Jays is no disgrace,
however, as they have one of
the top Division III programs in
the nation, having lost only to
the tenth-rated team in the
country, 3-2. Piranian said that
“they scored three goals in the
first three-and-one-half
minutes, and that was our undo-
ing.”’ He said that the game was
“otherwise respectable, as we
were clearly outplayed by an
extremely good ballclub.”’ Pira-
nian went on to say that he
would be ‘‘very surprised if
Elizabethtown does not do well
in the NCAA tournament.”

‘Carney came up with another

fine effort, despite the number
of goals he allowed, turning
away 17 of the Blue Jays’ 29
shots in the game. The Generals
took 14 shots on goal.

Upcoming for W&L are
games with Virginia Tech on
Sunday October 15, Homecom-

games are at home, with Sun-

vantage. Thus, in these first
five games, we have seen the
Generals learning to play in a
style uncommon to the veter-
ans ‘“‘Because of the new system
it’s been like coaching 60
freshmen’, said Fallon. “‘The
new system has caused a lot of
mistakes, and it’s cost us some
games.”

On bright spot last Saturday
was the running of Stewart
Atkinson. The junior tailback
ran for 52 yards and broke Ran-
dy Broyle’s career rushing
record of 1464 yards’ Atkinson
has 240 yards this year and 1476

ference with a 48 yards per

This Saturday’s opponent is
Hampden-Sydney College. The
Tigers, now 3-2 on. the year,
were preseason favorites to win
the ODAC. “If we can prevent
making mistakes and give our
best effort; then we might pull
off an upset’’, said Fallon. “A
game against a team the

Still, the question remains:

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

About Noise

Lexington’s noise ordinance remains an issue in the
fraternity houses on campus, even though no incident
of major consequence has occurred in the past few
weeks. The noise restriction remains—as does the
threat of arrest if the city statute is broken. The City
Council has not yet returned a verdict on the IFC’s of-
fer to restrict fraternity parties and the machinery of
government seems painfully slow to many impatient
fraternity men. So the fraternities hang in limbo as
the first of W&L’s ‘‘big’’ weekends approaches.

On the bright side, one notes that the police seem to
be more cordial in their dealings with the fraternities
of late. Of the court summonses recently issued for
violating the noise ordinance, none were issued before
the 1 a.m. cut-off time recommended by the IFC for
weekend parties. Of course Homecoming is no or-
dinary weekend, and the festivities scheduled may
Strain relations between the fraternities and the
townspeople yet one more time.

Within the confines of fraternity houses, there is
confusion over the relation of fraternities to the town,
the ‘‘absurdity”’ of the noise restriction, and talk of a
“boycott” to put ‘‘pressure on the town.’’ Many peo-
ple have the mistaken notion that a boycott of the
town’s businesses will somehow force a rescinding of
the noise ordinance.

The validity of the city statute, Section 15-32 (b),
will not be debated here. Suffice it to say that the
noise ordinance is law. Fraternity members have a
hard time remembering that they are members of the
community too, and therefore are subject to the same
laws as the townspeople. Many view this obligation to
the town as unfair. ‘‘Fraternities should be able to
party as long as they want to,” they say. Well, there is
no law against partying, just excessively loud noise.

There have also been rumblings about ‘‘boycot-
ting”’ the city’s businesses ‘‘to put pressure on the ci-
ty’’ to rescind the noise ordinance. Superficially ex-
amined, this scheme can work. Realistically con-
sidered, the boycott idea is a dud.

Roughly speaking, college students comprise one-
third of the population of this town, but half of that
one-third goes to VMI. That means that W&L students
make up one-sixth of Lexington’s population, and one-
half of them are not fraternity members. So, fraterni-
ty members comprise eight percent of the city’s
populace— representing not a whole lot of economic
clout.

The businesses primarily affected by a fraternity
boycott would be the food establishments around
town, and they have as much influence with the City
Council as the fraternities do.

So, it would seem, that there is not much the frater-
nities can do about Lexington’s noise ordinance. A
few weeks ago, the IFC presented the City Council
with a list of “concessions” the fraternities would be
willing to make to the city in return for the ordinance
being “relaxed” at specific times during the week.
When you get down to the bottom line, though, the
fraternities have no bargaining position with the city.
The law is on the books. Like it or not, only Council
can change or rescind a law, and there is not very
much the fraternities can do no matter what Lex-

ington’s city government decides next Thursday. J

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Beckley defends position on
Fancy Dress, student parties

October 9, 1978
Dear Editor:

I am compelled to respond to
Mr. M. Gray Coleman’s
editorial, ‘‘Faculty follies...,”’ in
the October 5th Ring-tum Phi. I
do not care to defend the level of
my discussion at the University
Council, but I am concerned
that Mr. Coleman’s column ob-
fuscates the issue which Mr.
Lad Sessions and I had hoped to
bring before the University
Council and the student body.

The issue is not whether the
faculty should attempt to
regulate the social activities of
the students, as Mr. Coleman
thinks it is. The issue is whether
students and faculty alike are
concerned and frustrated by an
unnecessary conflict between
academic work and social ac-
tivities. This conflict is created
when official social functions
are scheduled so as to cause
students to choose either

academic preparation or social .

activities. Faculty and students
alike have an interest in
regulating community ac-
tivities so that academic work
and official social activities will
compliment each other. We
should try to avoid ‘hard
choices’’ in which the ‘‘rugged
individualist” has to sacrifice
either his academic prepara-
tion and classes or the social ac-
tivities for which he has already

paid.

Neither Mr. Sessions nor I
ever had any intention of trying
to force a change of date for
Fancy Dress upon the students.
We did think that the University
Council was the appropriate
forum for faculty and students
together to discuss the possibili-
ty that Fancy Dress is one
social event which creates an
unnecessary choice between
social activities and academic
pursuits. The SAB seems to
have sensed this conflict.

Although they have not seen fit
to change any Fancy Dress ac-
tivities, they have decided not
to schedule Thursday parties as
a part of the other big social
weekends during the year.

Most of us favor a community
which maximizes individual
freedom, but it is a fetish about
“hard choices” and “rugged in-
dividualism’”’ that leads one to
argue that we ought to, create
conflicts that force unattractive
choices. A thoughtful and order-
ly scheduling of university and
fraternity social events would
maximize the student’s
freedom to enjoy both a plea-
sant social life and academic
diligence. There is a danger
that too many social events.
scheduled at the wrong time
will destroy freedom and force
students to make the “tough
choice.”’ Faculty members may
express their frustration when
they see this situation arise, but
it is for the students, or at least
for students and faculty
together, to remedy the situa-
tion. In the long run the students
probably have more to gain
from a regulated and orderly
social calendar than the facul-

ty.

I hope the other students at
the University Council meeting
did not come away with the im-
pression that anyone was trying
to impose a change in Fancy
Dress upon them. There is no
need for this community to
waste its energy discussing in
loco parentis,an issue on which
all of us are on the same side.
There is, however, a need for us
to discuss the properly ordered

relationship between social ac-

tivities and our academic pur-
suits. I would be delighted for
Mr. Coleman and others to turn
their attention to this issue.

Harlan Beckley
Assistant Professor
of Religion

 

Editor’s Note — Many thanks to
Professor Beckley for this
clarification of his position. Un-
fortunately, it doesn’t change
my opposition to such thought.
The overwhelming student opi-
nion against further social
regulation appears obvious to
me. So who is sounding off
about “‘thoughtful and orderly
scheduling of university and
fraternity social events,”’ if not
certain elements within the
faculty?

It is not my wish to belabor
this point any further, but I
would like to leave Professor
Beckley and company with
some final thoughts. In my four
years as a Student on this cam-
pus, I have seen many
undergraduates perform well in
the present social and academic
environment. Some, it is true,
have not fared so well. But they
appear to be a distinct minority.
So is it fair to regulate the ac-
tivities of the students who can
carry their weight?

Finally, as regards that
minority who habitually suc-
cumb to ‘‘temptations’’...is it
wise to assume that stricter
scheduling of large events will
curb them at all? It has always
seemed to me that there is no
one more inventive than the guy
determined to waste time. Take

one ‘“‘temptation” away — he’s ©

sure to find some other.

In any event, the University
Council has upheld the status
quo for the time being. It looks
as if we students will continue to
struggle along, taking our
choices as they come.

A team of top-notch students
is needed from. the
undergraduate school to par-
ticipate in this year’s College
Quiz Bowl, reports Mr. John M.
Gunn, associate professor of
economics.

The College Quiz Bowl,
resumed last year by the Na-
tional Association of Student
Unions, is a nationwide inter-
collegiate academic competi-
tion in a tournament format,
says Gunn.

Last year’s winners of the na-
tional tournament, held at Stan-
ford, were awarded $10,000 for
their school and also received
individual cash prizes.

Gunn explains that _ par-
ticipants need to be able to per-
form quick recall of academic
minutia. A three-man team is
required, with each student
versed in a different general
area, composed of either
natural sciences and
mathematics, literature and
fine arts, social Sciences and
public affairs. Each student
should also be well-versed in
sports anda hobby.

The executive committee has
allotted $160. for the financing
of a team, and other sources are
available for money, but no
group on campus has expressed
an interest in forming a team.
The E.C. and Student Activity
Board have already been ap-
proached.

An intramural competition
composed of a minimum of ten
matches is required for the for-

film society refused by E.C.

(continued from page 3)

“T assure you, not one of these
films has been shown on this
campus and will not be shown in
the future.”’

Diesing had told the commit-
tee that the SAB’s film service
‘is not providing the type of
films that the W&L community
wants.’’ Members of the film
society had felt that the SAB
would be unwilling to show the
types of films they desired.

Dudley, E.C. president, told the
group that they are entitled to
have their ‘“‘input with the
SAB.”

Both Kaston and Diesing said
they had not approached other
film groups on campus.

Sophomore E.C. represen-
tative Bob Willis said, ‘‘I don’t
think the SAB will be willing to
pump money for these types of
films.”’

Diesing said that the film

John Murphy, E.C. law school
representative, asked Diesing
.why the film society had not
first approached the SAB. Beau ,

society wants “‘to provide a dif-
ferent need and service to the
community.”’

Rob Calvert, senior E.C.1

representative, told the film
society, ‘‘it looks like you all
have not done a lot of in-
vestigating”’ into the different
outlets for films on campus.

‘‘We want to show just one
film that will make a splash,”’
Kaston said.

‘At the very least, I think we
should give them enough money
to show one film,”’ Willis said

But the E.C. voted 7-2-1 to
‘deny money to the film society
at this time,” with the recom-
mendation that they go to the
SAB and the law school’s film
group with their proposals.

of Italy during the final decade and coordinates numerous
of Austria’s predominance in Austrian, British and French
the Italian Peninsula. diplomatic documents which
have only recently been

In addition, he has incorporated
information contained in un-
published diplomatic  collec-
tions located in Vienna, Turin,
Rome, the Vatican and Paris.

The book traces’ the
background of Metternich’s in-
volvement in Italian affairs bet-
ween 1815 and 1848 and
describes the relationships bet-
ween Francis Joseph’s Austria
and the various Italian states
prior to their unification into a
single nation.

Dr. Jenks identifies the Cri-
mean War as a pivotal moment
of change, following which
sporadic Austrian gestures per-
mitting limited reform were in-
adequate to overcome Napoleon
III's interest in the Italian na-
tional question, British disgust
with Austrian illiberalism, and
growing sentiment in favor of
unification among the, Italian
States themselves. The War of
1859, Dr. Jenks observes, was
brought on by Francis Joseph’s
“obduracy”’ and led directly to
formation of the Kingdom of
Italy and the restriction of
Austrian power to Venetia and
Trieste.

Jenks, a 1939 W&L graduate
with M.A. and Ph.D. degrees
from Columbia, is one of the na-
tion’s foremost authorities in
Austrian. history. He is the
author of three other books in
the field: ‘“‘The Austrian Elec-
toral Reform of 1907’’ (1950)

‘and “Vienna and the Young

Hitler’’ (1960), both published
by Columbia and reprinted cur-
rently by Octagon, and
“Austria Under The Iron Ring,
1879-1893’ (1965), published by
The University Press of
Virginia.

He has taught at Washington
and Lee since 1946 and has held
visiting professorships at
Virginia, Maryland, Duke, VMI
and Virginia Tech.

Dr. John M. McDaniel, direc-
tor of the archaeological
research project at the ruins of

McDaniel is assistant pro-
fessor of anthropology at W&L.

Dear Phineas,

Is it true that the administra-

tion is planning for the students
to move the books from the old
to the new library?
Yes, it is, although it’s got about
as much chance of succeeding
as John Travolta has of getting
a bid from a Red Square frater-
nity. In reality, lots of other ac-
tivities will be going on that
day.

A pledge scavenger hunt will
be in operation. Some items
on the agenda will be a Com-
merce school paper with a
reference to Shakespeare, a pic-
ture of a thousand spectators at
a soccer game, an English club
member who can explain the ef-
fective interest method, money
for the new Film Society, and a
UVa. football jersey that’s been
retired for contributions to an
undefeated team.

Those of us who wish we were
at Colorado College will head

Phineas: Library Moves

for Massanutten for sledding.
(Skiing? Forget it!) By the
way, if you see a terrified figure
flying down the slopes with less
control than someore with six
cups of grain in hii, heading
for a tree with a Bible in his
hands, and arms raised towards
the heavens, it will probably be
the guy who thought up the idea
of the student book move in the
first place.

So now the question comes up,
how do the books get moved?
Well, there are always the in-
mates at Western State,
although if that happens one
might find the Biography of
Gloria Steinhem situated next
to Diary of A Mad Housewife.
What the hell, you can send
twenty bucks to Collegiate
Research Inc. for term papers
on anything from Abnormal
Endearments Among Penguins

Convention :

This is one in a series of ar-
ticles describing the 1980 W&L
Republican Mock Convention—
Its development and progress.

Washington and Lee’s Mock
Convention is a complete
political workshop with the
primary goal of education. In
this attempt to educate, the
Mock Convention’s efforts are
enhanced by politically astute
speakers. The speakers pro-
gram has an active roll both

before and during the conven-
tion.

This year’s speakers pro-
gram will focus on three areas
of politics. The first area is
political journalism, and its role
in the total political picture.
Secondly, there will be a discus-
sion on current issues by a pro-
minent Republican legislator
from Capitol Hill. The final goal
is to bring to campus a potential
candidate for the 1980

Fraternity house plan approved

The Lexington City Planning
Commission recently recom-
mended that Chi Psi Fraternity
be granted its petition for a zon-

19380

Republican nomination.

Next year, the pace of the
whole convention quickens as
the final weekend draws closer.
While continuing to bring big
names to campus, there will be
a number of field coordinators
and administrative assistants
from the Republican National
Committee. These profes-
sionals will offer the inside in-
formation and insight that
makes the convention so
realistic.

The Mock Convention has
traditionally brought to the
Washington and Lee campus
many politically important peo-
ple. Former and _ future
Presidents have often taken ac-
tive roles in many conventions,
not only through speeches but
also through personal discus-
sions with various committee
members. President Truman
was the keynoter at the 1960
Convention, and in 1968, Presi-
dent Nixon visited the W&L
campus. President Carter, then

_ Governor of Georgia, addressed

the 1972 Mock Convention.

_ While students at Washington
and Lee have heard great
speeches from’ keynote
speakers, the most memorable
/was that speech given by
former Vice President, Alben
|W. Barkley, in 1956. After
Barkley had delivered an arous-
ing, impassioned speech, he
became so infected with the en-
tire spirit of the event that he
suddenly collapsed and died
before the 1700 shocked people
involved in the 1956 Mock Con-
vention...

ing change so the Ann Smith
School can become a fraternity
residence.

Now, the only step remaining
is for the City Council to ap-
prove the commission’s action.
Council will meet to consider
the zoning change at a special
meeting October 26 at 9a.m.

A zoning change is necessary
because of city laws limiting
fraternity residences in town.
No opposition to the zoning
change is expected since the
major opponents to Chi Psi’s

proposal, the parishioners of St.
Patrick’s Catholic Church adja-
cent to the Ann Smith School,
recently gave their backing to
the fraternity’s plans.

Chi Psi intends to renovate
the building so that all fraterni-
ty members will be able to live
there. :

If all goes according to plan,
the fraternity will be rushing
out of their new lodge next year,
and living there the following
spring.

Presidential candidate’s
banner sabotaged

 

he was very upset and im-
mediately contacted Dean
Robert Huntley, Coordinator of
the Freshman Year, at his of-
fice.

Dean Huntley made several
phone calls, including a call to
Jay Foster, Schott’s dorm
counselor. Foster considered
the matter important enough to
ask George Berry, Assistant
Head Dorm Counselor for his
wing of the dorm, to help in-
vestigate the matter.

Berry and Foster inter-
rogated two freshmen several
times over the course of the
weekend, whom they suspected
of involvement in the incident.

During the weekend’s ques-
tioning, the dorm counselors
discovered that only one of the
students had actually been in-
volved; however, his identity
has not been disclosed.

According to Berry, ‘‘By Sun-
day night we knew who did it
and we confronted him” and
‘the told us that he had done it.”

Jay Foster did not wish to
comment on the incident, but
George Berry stated that the
dorm counselors considered the
incident, ‘‘not a matter for the
E.C...It has been taken to Stu-
dent Control.”

Berry said the incident was
“not a personal attack by one
student on another, it was an ac-
cident that we felt was serious
enough to go to Student Con-

Sigma Chi Fined $100,

Delt Fine Dropped

by David Greer

Delta Tau Delta fraternity’s
fine of $100 for ‘‘ungentlemanly
conduct’’ at the Lambda Chi
Alpha house was reduced to a
“stiff warning’ by the Inter-
fraternity Council’s Judicial
Board Tuesday night. In addi-
tion, Sigma Chi was fined $100
for a ‘‘kidnapping”’ infraction.

Freshman Stan Nolan, a
Sigma Chi pledge, was taken
from the freshman quad by
several Sigma Chi up-
perclassmen and was left on
Route 60 near the Blue Ridge
Parkway. He was picked up by
dorm counselor Bill Tucker,
who was returning from a road
trip.

The upperclassmen
involved—Pete Clements,
Ricky Wallerstein, Marsh Mer-
riman, Ed Jordan, Sam Rogers,
and Jim F lippen—said that they
did not realize that they were
breaking any rules.

The group said that they had
asked dorm counselor Charlie
Smith about kidnapping before
the incident, and that he had
told them that they could not
take anyone from the dorms.
They did not realize that the
quad is considered part of the
dorm area, and said that they
would not have broken the rules
if they had known them.
Clements stressed that they
were ‘‘trying to make sure we
did nothing wrong.”’

by IFC

The group said they created
no disturbance in the quad and
that Nolan put up no struggle.
They notified some other
pledges of Nolan’s whereabouts
so he could be rescued.

Judicial Board member Bill
Thistlethwaite, during the
Board’s deliberations on the
case, said,’ ‘‘a dorm counselor
really messed up this case—he
let them do something wrong.”

Board member Charles Terry
added that he thought, ‘they
were legitimate in that they
thought it was all right that they
were in the quad.”

It was also pointed out that
the Sigma Chi’s violated an IFC
rule against any pledging ac-

Homecoming cost $4,000, SAB says

by Dick Moss

While the final figures are not
yet tabulated, the SAB, ac-
cording to co-chairman Doug
Jackson, spent an estimated
$4,000 this past weekend on
Homecoming. This figure
agrees with the approximate
budget which the SAB had
made for the weekend.

At the SAB meeting Sunday
night, board members were
asked about any reactions they
received about Homecoming,
and while the general reaction
seemed to be good, there were a
few complaints about the noise
and the time factor at the con-
cert Friday night.

Film Society
Given $100

Jim Diesing, president pro-
tem, came before the SAB. to
ask for funds totaling $100 for
second film in their series, the
first being paid for by the
Glasgow Endowment. Diesing
and Professor Kaston were told
to come to the SAB by the E.C.

After a presentation by Ms.
Kaston and Diesing, and a few
minutes of discussion among
SAB members, the SAB voted to
give $100 to the Film Society,
and promised to consider any
further requests for funds from
the Film Society.

Ms. Kaston then left the
= but on her way out,

she told the Board members
that she was “‘very impressed”’
with the considerate manner
with which they had treated
her. She also stated that, ‘“‘The
E.C. seemed to give us the cold
shoulder’’ when they went
before that body, and that this
increased her favorable im-
pression of the SAB.

(See related story
on page 4)

Other Business
In other matters, the SAB an-

nounced a number of bands be-
ing considered for Fancy Dress,
among them, Art Mooney, Glen
Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Duke
Ellington, and Stan Keaton.

The SAB also voted to have
Menus, a Brazilian jazz group,
in the Cockpit, on Nov. 9 or 11,
at a cost of between $150-$200.

The SAB will also be sponsor-
ing a concert by Happy Trom in
the Cockpit Oct. 25, and a guitar
workshop on Oct. 26 in the
music room, led by Trom. The
cost for Trom will be $600.

Nine freshmen removed from ballot Monday

by Randy Smith

“T think the whole election
should be done over Wednes-
day,’ said junior represen-
tative Steve Abraham at the
Executive Committee’s
meeting Monday night.

Nine of the 17 freshman can-
didates for class and committee
offices failed to submit a finan-
cial statement by 7 p.m. Sun-
day, so their names _ were
stricken from the ballot.

Abraham noted that ‘‘a
number of candidates’’ had left
the E.C. room before the com-
mittee established that a can-
didate’s failure to submit a list
of expenses incurred during the
campaigh would result in hav-

ing his name removed from the
ballot.

“I think we moved a little
quickly,” said Beau Dudley,
E.C. president, but he was op-
posed to the idea of reopening
the elections.

‘‘Many freshmen didn’t know
the regulations and only turned
in their petitions (for office),’’
E.C. vice-president Bill Tucker
said.

“When you’re talking about
people running for office, the
very least we can expect of
them is to know their respon-
sibilities,’ argued sophomore
representative Will Mackie.

“I’m not convinced that we
made a mistake,’’ said Dudley.
“] think if it (the election) is

trol,’’ and added, ‘‘I think all
parties involved are satisfied
with the way it has been handl-
ed so far and I am quite sure
there will be no repercussions.”’

Reflecting on the incident,
Dan Schott said, “I can ap-
preciate practical jokes, but
when someone goes to the ex-
tent to damage people’s proper-
ty or valued possessions, that
doesn not appeal to me as fitting
the W&L ideal of a gentleman.”’

Schott indicated that he was
impressed with the manner in
which it was handled, adding
that the matter was ‘“‘dealt with
quickly and quietly. I had very
little to do with it.”’

Dean Robert Huntley called
the matter ‘“‘troubling,” but
praised Dorm Counselors
George Berry and Jay Foster
for doing a _  ‘‘thorough,

straightforward and _ candid
job”’ in their investigation.

that important to them, then
they should be here.”’

Only two freshman can-
didates attended the E.C.
meeting, neither of them to pro-
test the election.

Tucker initiated a motion to
cancel Monday’s freshman
election, but when it came down
to a vote, his only support came
from Abraham and the motion
was defeated 2-8.

Pertaining to today’s run-off
election, the E.C. established
that write-in candidates not be
allowed to run, that the spen-
ding limit be raised $2.50, and
that no financial statement

need be submitted.

In other business at Monday
night’s meeting, the E.C. heard
from the Calyx business
manager that last year’s year-
book editor, Temp Webber, had
apparently charged over $60
worth of personal expenses to
the Calyx.

Grant Leister, Calyx business
manager and representative

UVa. fraternities warned

CHARLOTTESVILLE
Police officials have sent for-

mal warnings to University of -

Virginia fraternities, threaten-
ing arrest if some steps are not
taken to curb public drinking
and noise violations.

The move came as the result
of repeated complaints by
residential neighbors, concern-
ed about repeated late-night
parties and insufficient trash
disposal. Mayor Lawrence
Brunton of Charlottesville then

met last week with a newly-
formed Interfraternity Council
to inform the students of the
ultimatum.

According to police, the Inter-
fraternity Council leaders have
been most cooperative; un-
fortunately, success has been
rather slow among the fraterni-
ty men in general.

_ Fraternity houses are now
patrolled with police noise
meters. At the present time, the

Charlottesville noise ordinance
goes into effect at 10 p.m. each
night. Therefore, it appears
that these fraternities may soon
face the barrage of summonses
and arrests that have been seen
in Lexington, most recently in
the past few weeks. Charlottes-
ville authorities are ready to
take action; Mayor Brunton
concluded, ‘‘We can’t have a
double standard...We want the
police to enforce our ordinances
the same for everybody.”

E.C. hears committee reports

(continued from page 2)

Cockpit food bills to the Calyx,
Leister said.

Both charges were made
toward the end of last year and
were not discovered until this
year, the business manager told
the E.C.

Both bills were paid for by the .

Pub. Board and were being
mailed to Webber and his col-
lege transcript was being frozen
until the debts were repaid,
Leister said.

While at the meeting, Leister
told the E.C. that this year’s

Calyx had already spent close
to $11,000.

Publisher’s costs amounted to
$10,000 in the first installment,
Leister told the committee.
Senior portraits and darkroom
expenses cost the yearbook $600
and $341, respectively.

The Calyx collected $140 from
undergraduates who had not
paid for their yearbook pictures
during matriculation.

Ben Keesee, editor Ariel, the
student literary magazine, said
that he hopes to publish the first
edition by the week before ex-

ams.

“We seem to be going in the
right direction and I’m very op-
timistic,”’ Keesee said.

The Student Activities Board
announced the appointment of
Robert Neely, a sophomore, as
the new Publicity Director for
the board.

Dick Gregory to
speak in Chapel

Dick Gregory, comedian and
civil rights leader, will speak at
Lee Chapel at 8 p.m. on Tues-
day, Oct. 24. The event is spon-
sored by the Student Associa-
tion for Black Unity, and is open
to the entire community. No ad-
mission fee will be charged for
the event.

As one critic says, ‘‘It is dif-
ficult to label the prolific ac-
tivities of Dick Gregory. He
became famous as a _ profes-
sional comedian. Today he is a
recording artist, author, lec-
turer, actor, human rights ac-
tivist, social satirist, critic,
philosopher and _ political
analyst, who combines all of
these roles to serve the cause of
human liberation and to
alleviate human suffering
brought on by ignorance and
apathy.”’

Dick Gregory chose a career
in comedy at a time when black
comedians received bookings
only in black clubs and
theaters. In 1961, he was called

as a last-minute replacement at
Chicago’s. Playboy Club. He
was an immediate sensation,
soon appearing in all the top
clubs in the country and on ma-
jor network television shows.

During the civil rights move-
ment of the 1960s, Dick Gregory
participated in every major
(and most minor) demonstra-
tion for human rights in
America. He devoted his time
and talent to benefits for civil
rights groups, peace groups,
and other clusters of people
devoted to human liberation.
Ironically, the doors he had
opened in the entertainment in-
dustry began to slam in his
face, but he has continued his
widespread activities in this
area.

Dick Gregory the lecturer has
become a sought-after speaker
in America on college cam-
puses. He visits more than 300
colleges each school year, and
his popularity among business
groups is rapidly growing.

Entertain

Animal House
hits big Lex.

by Dick Barron

You’ve heard about it, you’ve
read about it, you’ve probably
seen it, and now it’s here. Na-
tional Lampoon’s Animal House
has officially blasted its way in-
to Lexington, and _ sources
report that the town may never
be the same.

This past Friday the thir-
teenth may have brought doom
and bad luck to many, but to the

ment

Film Society scores

Action taken last week by the
Glasgow Endowment Program
saved the fledgling W&L Film
Society from what appeared to
be a very limited engagement.
The Glasgow grant came on the
heels of the Film Society’s un-
successful plea for funds to the
E.C.

Specifically, the Glasgow En-
dowment has offered to provide
up to $1500 in matching grants
to bring modern art films to ca
us. Further, .Glasgow has
agreed to fund the entire cost of
the first Film Society presenta-
tion, Bergman’s Cries and
Whispers.

Bergman’s 1972 masterpiece
is scheduled to be shown Friday
and Saturday, Nov. 9-10, in one
of the large Law _ School
classrooms. Following each
screening there will be a recep-
tion open to all.

Tentatively scheduled for the
second weekend after
Thanksgiving is Fassbider’s
1976 Chinese Roulette. Funds to
match the Glasgow money for
this film were provided by the
SAB.

Generating funds to match
those of the Glasgow Endow-
ment, in order to bring winter
term films to the campus, is a
major concern of the Society,
presently presided over by Jay
Diesing. Unfortunately, an ad-
mission charge to Society films
is impossible because this
jumps the rental fee on a film
from $300 or $400 to well over
$1000 per film.

Instead, the Film Society will
appeal for a subscription-like
donation from those attending
the series. This appeal is
directed mainly to faculty and
townspeople to whom screen-
ings will be open.

In fact, the Society intends to
direct mailings and advertising
toward the entire Lex-
ington/VMI/W&L community.
Donations of up to $25 will make
one a ‘‘member”’ of the Society,
up to $50 makes one a “‘spon-
sor’’ and any donation ex-
ceeding $50 makes one an
‘“‘angel’’ (sic). These in-
dividuals, as well as sponsoring
businesses, will be listed in a
program to be distributed at
Film Society screenings.

Other activities of the Film
Society include the selection of
the films to be shown. Diesing

 

feels that the contemporary art
films selected by the Society fill
a definite gap in campus offer-
ings. No one group has the
money to spend on the type of
films shown by the Society and
‘Professor Jennings’ film
course only deals with the
basics.”

So far Film Society meetings
have played to large crowds of
about 30 students who represent
a cross-section of majors.
Finally, if student interest, as

shown by meeting attendance,
isn’t enough to show a definite
place for the Society on cam-
pus, society advisor Carren
Kaston senses, ‘‘a different at-
mosphere on campus for film
than there has been for a long
time.”’

She feels that the film courses
offered have ‘‘sensitized
students to film,’’ and further,
‘that this is a ripe time’”’ for the
Film Society, as they begin
their first year on Campus.

Musical Mainstream

It appears that summer’s end
has not brought an end to the
series of tours that caused
many people to acclaim 1978 as
the ‘“‘Year of the Road Show.”
While some folks are wrapping
up their summertime treks,
others are just now taking to the
road, and at least one of the ma-
jor events of the summer is still
going on.

The one show out of the new
crop which promises to turn in-

to a major event is Peter -

Gabriel’s first large-scale tour
of the United States as a solo ar-
tist. He recently departed from
his itinerary of 4,000-5,000 seat
auditoriums to play two SRO
shows at the Bottom Line in
New York City which beat the
attendance figures of such New
York favorites as Bruce Spring-
steen and Graham Parker.
Musical Mainstream has been
invited to Gabriel’s per-
formance at the Stanley
Theatre in Pittsburgh on Oc-
tober 27; look forward to more
coverage within the next two
weeks.

In addition, Dave Edmunds,
whose latest album I reviewed
last week, has just embarked on

a major tour of the United
States along with Van Morrison.
Edmunds will be accompanied
by his band Rockpile, featuring
Nick Lowe on bass, and he will

’ also do two shows at the Bottom

Line, this time without Mor-
rison.

On the West Coast, Yes wrap-
ped up their 1978 U.S. tour with
dates at the L.A. Forum and the
Oakland Colisseum. At the final
Oakland show, the band was
surprised with the presence of
the Oakland Raiders’
cheerleading squad; when they
returned to the stage for their
encore, they were each ac-
companied by their own
cheerleaders. Then, believe it
or not, the ladies did a routine
along with ‘‘Roundabout.”’
That, combined with pies in the
faces from their roadies after
the encore, must have made for
a truly bizarre evening for band
and audience alike.

Equally miraculous in some
ways is the fact that, after five
months and over 70 shows in as
many cities, Bruce Springsteen
is STILL on the road. He’ll be
playing at the Capital Centre in
Washington on November 2.

409 S. Main St.

students of Washington and
Lee, it brought Homecoming ’78
and Animal House. That’s one
powerful combination.

The student is now able to go
out and create his own chaos
and then relax while he watches
a repeat of the same thing on
the big screen. Unlike anything
ever filmed before, Animal
House allows the viewer to ex-
perience the less dignified side
of college life in all its shameful
glory.

For those readers who have
been lost in a cave for the last
two months, the story of Animal
House involves two fraternities
at ‘Faber College.’’ One of
these houses (the Omegas) is
supremely perfect, while the
other is a monument to bad
taste (Delta Tau Chi) — the
‘*Animal House.”

The members of the latter in-
clude ‘“‘Bluto’’ (John Belushi),
“Otter” (Tim Matheson), and
“Boon” (Peter Riegert), along
with a large troop of campus
cut-ups. The Animal House is a
leader in its community, with
many achievements to _ its
credit, among them many all
night parties and some of the
most destructive escapades

by Mark Mainwaring
and Robin Meredith

Springsteen fans might be well-
advised to keep their eyes open
for possible dates in Charlottes-
ville or Roanoke.

Just a reminder: Aerosmith,
hot on the heels of their ap-
pearance in Sgt. Pepper’s Lone-
ly Hearts Club Band, will ap-
pear at the Roanoke Civic
Center this Thursday along with
Exile (,’Kiss You All Over’’).
Waylon Jennings and Jessi Col-
ter, the hottest couple in coun-
try and western, will hit the
Civic Center this Friday. Both
shows will begin at 8 p.m.

It wast

against the rules...

ever seen at Faber College
(where ‘‘knowledge is good’’).

The story is average, but it
becomes amazing in the hands
of scriptwriters Harold Ramis,
Doug] Kinney, and Chris Miller.
This crackerjack team of
writers from the National Lam-
poon gives this film its never-a-
dull-moment pace, and the well
trained cast gives it a sparkle
that’s rarely seen in today’s
comedy films. :

Film editor George Folsey,
Jr, makes several comic cuts in
the film, the most memorable
being the scene at the Black
nightclub in which Otis Day
tells his band to ‘“‘hit it’ while
several Delta brothers come
literally crashing into the park-
ing lot outside.

Recent attendance figures for
Animal House reveal that the
film has already grossed $60
million and that speaks for its
popularity. For a majority of
the viewers, Aiimal House
looks like a zany comedy about
a bunch of wise-guy frat men.

Many would refuse to believe
the absurd episodes. of
debauchery and _ destruction
which occur there, actually ex-
ist, yet to a large group of W&L
men, the film seems to mirror a
substantial portion of fraternity
life. Fraternities roll on in this
world as tributes to the past and
shelters from the future.

Countless stories of mass
idiocy abound in the lore and
legend of the W&L fraternity
system. Everything from
‘‘gatoring” to “road tripping”’
is given a fair treatment in
Animal House, but what we at
W&L fail to realize is that the
film belongs to all moviegoers
in its sheer comic delight.

There’s quite a bit of Animal
House imitation going on
among today’s college students.
‘“‘Louie Louie’ has surfaced
overnight as the hottest party
song, and while Animal House

Jacobsen engages
Simon Gray play

by R.B. Ramirez

Last year, the University
Theatre planned to produce
Simon Gray‘s Butley, a play
about a man struggling with
personal relationships in this
modern society. Unfortunately,
it was never presented, but the
week after next, Butley’s com-
panion piece, Otherwise Engag-
ed will open, in a production

Lead actors

 

Faylor Harbison and Kurt Ka

that deserves no small amount
of interest.

Otherwise Engaged, as the ti-
tle implies, is about a man,
Simon, who chooses not to em-
brace the world but to ignore it,
to shut it out. One wonders why
Simon behaves in this manner;
indeed, the reasons may be
more complex that they appear
to be.

Well, when John Jacobsen,

      

Se Ss : ‘
mmerer rehearse ascene

from John Jacobsen’s production of Otherwise Engaged.

Cockpit music

by Dash Coufal

The Bent Mountain Opera
Company will play the Cockpit
on Saturday night, Oct. 21. This

multi-talented four piece band.

from Roanoke plays a variety of
songs from almost every
musical genre. Jim Stallard,
the originator of the band with
his wife, Patty, plays acoustic
and electric guitar, violin and
mandolin.

His wife plays cello, electric
bass and the twangy Jew’s
harp, as well as singing. Kevin
Orcutt plays electric slide and
acoustic guitar and Chuck
Davis handles all the percus-
sion and drums. All four of the
Opera Company sing, and their
four part harmonies are very
well matched.

They will play songs of Janis,
Taj Mahal, Eric Clapton,
Dylan, The Beatles, as well as
some western swing and
bluegrass. The performance
will begin at 8:30 and last till at
least midnight. There will be a
$1.00 cover charge for W&L
students and $1.25 for all non-
W&L guests.

Halloween
Party

This year’s Cockpit Hallo-
ween party will be Oct. 27 and
will have the Allstars, a blues
and rock band, playing from
8:30-12:30.

Describing themselves as a
boogie band, the Allstars from
Charlottesville play everything
from straight 12-bar blues to
Chicago blues to good hard

rock; from Muddy Waters’
“Forty Days and Forty Nights”’
to Bruce Springsteen’s ‘The
Fever’’ and Fleetwood Mac’s
“Tell Me All The Things (You
Do).”

Called ‘Just about the best
blues band in the Southeast,” by
Nick Tosches of The Rolling
Stone, the band features a lead
vocalist named Lucile Schottle,
who “has a voice that seems to
start in her toes and surge up
from there,’ (Charlie Mc-
Collum, The Washington Star).
The band also features a
dynamite harmonica. player,
Doug Jay; two good guitarists,
Rick Green and Steve Bliley;
bass player Steve Riggs; and
drummer Paul Hammond.

The band played the Cockpit
twice last year with great suc-
cess and is expected to repeat
the fun this year. Their new
album Tip Your Waitress is on
Adelphi records and_ is
available in the supply store
record shop. There are no
originals on the album, but it
does feature Koko Taylor's
“Voodoo Woman,” Otis Rush’s
“My Love Will Never Die,”’
Papa Lightfoot’s ‘“‘Mean Old
Train,’ as well as Wyonie Har-
ris’ ‘‘Wasn’t That Good,” a
great old rocker.

The party starts at 8:30 and
the cover charge. will be $1.50
for W&L students and their
dates, $2.50 for non-students,
and only a buck for students
wearing at least the top half of a
costume. Half price brew for
toga clad partyers!! So get out
that white sheet and laurel
wreath and toga!

the director of this production,
saw the original in London (it
has been playing there since
1976, and opened more recently
in New York), he wondered
about this, and hit upon a novel
method of exploring a complex
and interesting character.

The actors, both in the script
and in several improvisa-
tions, have been rehearsed to
within an inch of their lives, and
have spent no small amount of
time in discussions, exercises,
and sharing of ideas, hoping to
maintain a high level of energy
and spontaneity on the stage.

But there’s nothing _par-
ticularly innovative about any
of that. What really makes this
production stand out is the fact
that Jacobsen has decided to let
the part of Simon be shared by
two actors, each highly capable
in his own way. Each of the two
actors, Taylor Harbison and
Kurt Kammerer, has a personal
method of dealing with the role
of Simon, as well as with that of
Dave, who plays opposite him.

At first it would seem as
though such close collaboration
between two actors would lead
them to imitate each other’s in-
terpretation, but this has not
turned out to be the case. They
may have come to occasional
agreements about their
characters, but each will deal
with the task of interpretation
quite independently. The real
kicker is that not until the time
comes to apply makeup and to
don a costume, one short hour
before the curtain rises, will
anyone but the director know
which actor will be given which
part for the evening’s per-
formance. According to
Jacobsen, this is just one more
way to keep actors alert and
primed, for it forces them to
conserve their energy until the
last possible minute.

Jacobsen has gone even fur-
ther in his senior thesis ex-
perimentation. Every evening,
after the show, he hopes that the
audience will remain in the
threatre long enough for the ac-
tors to return to the stage and to
engage them in dialogue about
how the performance went.

The show will run this way for
three nights, and then will close
for two, so that the whole thing
may be re-worked to ac-
commodate the audience’s
comments and_ suggestions.
After two dark nights, the show
will play for two more per-
formances.

Certainly, the actors will be
surprised every evening at least
as much as the audience. It
WILL be a thoroughly different
show each time, and from all
apperances, one could do worse
than to see it all five times.

Football team goes
0-6 after loss to H-S

by Bill Whalen

The Washington and Lee
Generals moved one step closer
to total ignominy by losing their
sixth straight game last Satur-
day to Hampden-Sydney, 14-0.

The contest, played before a
Homecoming crowd of 5,000 at
Wilson Field, was yet another
frustrating 60 minutes of foot-
ball for Head Coach Gary
Fallon.

“Overall, we played our best
game of the year,”’ said Fallon,
‘but those turnovers killed us
again.”

The Generals turned the ball
over five times against H-SC,
including four fumbles and one
interception. Two of the
fumbles were converted into
Hampden-Sydney touchdowns,
while another stopped W&L on
the H-SC 19. “I think our
fumbles may be a result of over
trying,’’ said Fallon.
“Sometimes our runners are
trying too hard for that extra
yard, and they give too many
tacklers a chance to strip the
ball. In last Saturday’s game,
several players were guilty of
doing this.”

Excluding the turnovers, the
game was a tough contest that
featured the work-horse runn-
ing of tai!lbacks Stewart Atkin-
son and Jim Ferguson. Atkin-
son carried the ball 29 times for
112 yards, while Ferguson car-
ried 25 times for 115 yards and
one touchdown. The H-SC
running back needs only 131
yards to break the all-time state
rushing record.

On their first possession in the
game, W&L drove from their
own 46 to the Tigers’ 19 before
Stewart Atkinson fumbled on
the H-SC 20. Hampden-Sydney
then marched 80 yards on 13
plays for their first touchdown.
Bill Newell's ten yard pass to
Tom Gray gave H-SC a 7-0 lead
with 7:30 left in the first
quarter.

This turned out to be the only

Hampden-Sydney was_ twice

Action at Sunday’s lacrosse game. It was for ‘a good time.”

Alumni win lacrosse
game, Emmer gets trip

by Chris Sisto

“It was good to get everyone
together and have a good time’,
said head lacrosse coach Jack
Emmer when he described Sun-
day’s fourth annual Alumni-
Varsity lacrosse game. The
alumni were victorious 14-13 on
Dave Warfield’s score with 2:09
remaining in the game. War-
field, who scored five goals in
the game, was a co-captain of
the 1975 team.

The game was close
throughout with alumni holding
the largest leads. These leads
came on two three goal margins
when the score was 4-1 and 6-3.
The varsity came back both
times and this made for an ex-
citing seccond half. Although
the game was close, play was

relatively sloppy. Passes were

-

dropped and _ overthrown,
stickhandling was poor, and
there were several minor
penalties. Emmer was quick to
point out that it is early and
everyone is still “rusty” from
the lack of practice.

Early in the contest it was all
alumni. But with 1:30 remain-
ing in the first period, senior
midfielder Dirk Pieper and
senior attackman John Black
added tallies within forty-five
seconds of each other to pull the
score to 4-3, which was how the
quarter ended.

In the second quarter the var-
sity closed another three goal
lead and tied the score at seven
when junior midfielder Ray
McNulty scored with forty-five
seconds remaining in the
period. The half ended at a 7-7

successful remainder of the
season for Washington and
Lee’s Division III team are very
good.

Senior forward Todd Tyson
scored the Generals’ first goal
against Richmond, which
enabled W&L to tie the Spiders
1-1 after the first half. Senior
midfielder Howie Collier scored
in the second half as_ the
Generals’ defense turned in a
strong team effort’ to aid
sophomore goalie Kevin Carney
in recording his first win of the
season. Coach Rolf Piranian
said that W&L ‘‘played real well
as a team,”’ and that he ‘‘made
a couple of changes’ in the
usual alignment that turned out
to be successful.

In Virginia Tech, the
Generals encountered a team
which sported a 5-2 record and
which was ranked 13th in the
Middle Atlantic Region before
the game. Piranian said that
the Gobblers were a ‘‘sounder
ballclub’’ than were the

Generals, but that W&L played
with ‘‘more intensity and more

discipline,’’ and that these were
the two keys to success. Co-
captain Bill Stone broke out of
his season-long scoring slump
in the first half, with an assist
from Bill Brown. Sophomore
Craig Burns’ scored an
unassisted goal for the game-
winner. Piranian said that ‘‘we
had taken some chances defen-
sively in order to get more of-
fensive punch, and it paid off for
us.”

The Generals renewed a big
rivalry yesterday against
James Madison University in a
game that was played after
press time. The Generals had
not beatem JMU since 1970
entering yesterday’s contest.

On Saturday W&L travels to
Roanoke College to renew its
oldest rivalry. The Generals
hold a 23-12-3 advantage over
the Maroons, and Piranian is
looking to maintain the success
which W&L has enjoyed so far

in the series. He has every -

reason to be confident, because
after his team’s first two wins,
Piranian says that ‘“‘we now

tie.

In the third period both teams
scored four goals. The varsity
had its only lead of the game
when junior attackman Jay
Foster scored one of his three
goals of the day just 17 seconds

into the quarter. Junior Middie
John Hooper tied the score at 11
with his goal when only 24
seconds remained. In_ this
quarter Jay Sindler (’78) scored
two of his three goals for the
alumni.

In the final period the alumni
out scored the varsity 3-2 to give
them the winning margin. In
this quarter Warfield scored
two goals.

Coach Emmer was not at all
concerned about the loss. He
said, “It was a lot of fun for
everyone. I just wanted to get a
look at everyone and play
everybody equally.’”” Emmer
was pleased with his team plan
in the second half and also with
the support from the 40 some
alumni who showed up. He also
added, ‘‘I look for a good year
from this team. Our defense
and attack are set and we have
a good nucleus of midfielders.
We should also get help from
our freshmen how didn’t even

Emmer was not only pleased
with the morning game but also
with the post-game reception.
Over 100 lacrosse players,
alumni, and friends awarded
Emmer and his wife Joan an all

muda. This, a second honey-
moon for the Emmers, is for the

Tennis team ends season
on losing not in Tourney

by John Winans

W&L completed its fall tennis
season here with the last of
their three tournaments, and
ended up on the losing end of all
three of their matches.

The netmen faced three tough
Division I teams in the Second
Annual W&L Fall Invitational
this past Homecoming
Weekend. In their first match
the Generals lost to Ohio

University, 7-2. The doubles
team of Stewart Jackson and
Shaw Cranfield were victorious
in their match against Ohio as
well as in their match with
Maryland. In the next contest,

W&L lost in a heartbreaker to ©

the Terrapins of Maryland 5-4.
This was the closest that a W&L
tennis team ever came to
beating tough Maryland. The
Wahoos of Virginia had more
luck against the Generals,

consciousness. The closest W&L
could get was to the H-SC 40, but
Rich Hachenburg’s fumble end-
ed any possibility of scoring.
This was just the beginning of a
frustrating day for W&L, which
has been shut out twice ina row.

In the second half, things
went from bad to good to bad
again for W&L. Stewart Atkin-
son mishandled a pitchout at
the W&L 33, giving H-SC the
ball. The Tigers drove to the
W&L 16, but Newell’s pass was
intercepted by cornerback Jack
Norberg. Two plays later,
tullback Jim Palemmo fumbled
on the 10, and Hampden-Sydney
ran only one play to score their
final touchdown. Ferguson’s 10
yard run gave H-SC a 14-0 lead,

which they held for the rest of —

the game.

The Generals were not ready
to give up, however. Three
times were they able to move
inside H-SC territory. Once,
they made it to the Tiger’s 37
before punting. Another time,
they got down to the Tiger’s 22,
but Hachenburg’s pass on
fourth down was intercepted.
On their last chance, the
Generals made it to Hampden-
Sydney’s 14, only to be penaliz-
ed to the 30 and, once again
stopped on fourth down. This
was the final nail in the coffin
for W&L.

Every loss is hard for Gary
Fallon to accept, so don’t tell
him this game was a moral vic-
tory. ‘‘We lost to a team that
gave us plenty of chances to
win. I don’t see how anyone
could call that a victory,’’ said
Fallon. ‘“We’re not learning to
accept defeat,’’ said the coach.
“I think this is the main reason
why our games have been so
close. We haven’t lost that
desire to win.”

The Generals, now 0-6 on the
year, have four tough opponents
to play. Last year’s squad beat
Sewanee, Bridgewater and
Georgetown, while losing to
Emory & Henry, 7-6. Sewanee is
coming off a big upset of
Southwestern, 28-13.
Bridgewater upset Hampden-
Sydney, 10-9, and Georgetown
has the top-rated offense among
Division III teams. Even
Emory & Henry is an improved
team, so there is no real break
in the schedule.

This Saturday’s opponent,
and the next to last home oppo-
nent, is Sewanee. The Tigers,
1-3 on the year, are always

tough. ‘‘They’re improving with
each game,” said Fallon.
“They have a strong offensive
backfield and a good pursuing
defense. They’re a lot like
Hampden-Sydney or
Maryville.”

If the Generals are going to

win a game soon, this could be .-

it. Game time is 1:30 at Wilson
Field.

however, winning 9-0.

“Our objectives for the fall
season were met in that we
found our top eight players for
the spring season, as we faced
tough competition and gained
experience that will be very
valuable in the spring,’’ Coach
Gary Franke explained. ‘‘We
were right in there in our mat-
ches and hung tough. The fall
season is for looking over the
talent that you have and for
gaining experience. We ac-
complished both of these
goals.”” The Generals will keep

in practice this winter by play- .

ing some racquetball until the
snow disappears when they can
start to gear up for the spring
season.

“This spring we will be facing
Division I schools which should
give us a real edge when we do
play Division III and con-
ference teams,’’ Franke ex-
plained. Pre-season starts
February 5, and according to
Coach Franke, the Generals
‘will be ready.”

United Way run

planned for Sunday

The Washington and Lee
cross country team and co-
captain Bob Bates have an-
nounced plans for a United Way
Benefit run to take place on
Sunday. The actual run will be
36 miles starting at W&L and
concluding at Sweet Briar. Ap-
proximately 36 runners from
both schools will take part with
each male runner expected to
run five miles and each female
runner to run one. The group
will run along Route 60 east
beginning at 11:00 and plan to
finish their journey in five

Bates is hoping to receive a
pledge of $1 per mile for a total
of $36 from each of W&L’s 16
fraternities as well as similair
donations from local merchants
and other interested _in-
dividuals. Bates is looking to
collect over $500 for the area’s

Despite being on their home
course this past Homecoming
Weekend, the cross country
Generals dropped three meets.

Washington and Lee scored 70
points, while Bridgewater
scored 58, Roanoke 54, and
Eastern Mennonite 28.

The first place time of 25:54,
turned in by a Bridgewater run-
ner, was the second fastest time
run on the course. The course
record is 25:21.

“IT ran my best race ever,”’
were the words of W&L’s first
place finisher, co-captain Bob
Bates. Bates’ time of 27:00 plac-
ed him fifth overall and was 35
seconds off the W&L record: for

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Election chaos

Almost anyone who has run for a student office on
this campus will tell you that there isn’t much “red
tape” involved. Fifty names on a petition, a quick ac-
count of your campaign expenditures to the E.C., and
you're there. The whole idea is to give the candidate
more time te present his views to the students.

Sounds pretty easy, doesn’t it? Well, I thought so,
too — until last Monday’s freshman elections. Only
seventeen freshmen presented petitions for the four
class offices, a figure low in itself, compared to recent
years. But the real clincher was that over 50% of
these names had to be dropped from the ballot,
because those candidates neglected to file a cam-
paign expense record with the E.C. Sunday night.

Several candidates protested the omission of their
names from the ballot, and the point was raised that
the Honor System alone should sufficiently curb any
violations of the spending limit. Even so, I feel the
report requirement has more to do with responsibility
than honor. Almost all the candidates were present
when the E.C. requested this report; announcements
were also made in the Phi and the E.C. minutes. And
the ludicrous point is that they only had to account for

‘a spending limit of $7.50. The question arises: if a can-
didate can’t perform such a small task, do you really
want him handling your affairs?

Evidently, such small matters as responsibility
meant very little to the voters. The result of Monday’s
ballot was the most confusing array of ‘“‘write-in”’
votes in recent memory. Voters seemed to have dif-
ficulty remembering who was running for what of-
fice; some write-in contenders received votes in two
or three different races. One can’t help thinking that
if these candidates had been a little more on the ball,
a lot of confusion would have been avoided. At least,
the voters could tell if they were casting the right vote
for the right position. Oddly enough, voters really ap-
preciate that courtesy.

At the E.C. meeting that night, the fog began to lift.
The Voting Regulations Board has been given one
month to establish a revised set of election guidelines,
including a requirement that candidates attend the
rule-setting meeting when petitions for office are due.
The committee then. turned to the business of
freshman run-off elections, scheduled for today. (As a
result of Monday’s fiasco, not one freshman can-
didate received a necessary majority.) Write-in votes
were declared void for the run-offs — a wise move.
Without this restriction, freshman elections (and con-
fusing write-ins) could have continued indefinitely.

Freshmen should thank the E.C. for clearing up this

mess, but the problem is still a disturbing one. The ©

spirit of responsibility and initiative was sadly lack-
ing in this freshman campaign — and that’s not the
road to effective leadership.

tivities taking place outside the
city limits.

IFC president Jim Davis said
that he was not aware of rule’s
existence, but Assistant Dean of
Students Dan Murphy said that
the rule had been ‘‘there for
years” and that the dorm
counselors are responsible for
IFC rules. He added that the
rules ‘“‘must be enforced, or the
IFC Judicial Board will be a
joke.”

The Board voted a $100 fine on
the basis that the pledging ac-
tivity took place outside Lex-
ington.

The Delt fine

In other Judicial Board
business, Delta Tau Delta ap-
pealed their fine of $100 for
“ungentlemanly conduct’ at
the Lambda Chi Alpha house
assessed last week.

All of the Delts involved in the
incident were present at the
meeting, except one, as were
several members of Lambda
Chi.

Delt Ross Germano said that
two Lambda Chi’s had invited
Delts to come to their party. He
said that they were just talking
to girls when Keith Romich, a
Lambda Chi, asked them to
leave.

Before they could leave,
though, Romich returned and
said that they could stay and
that he had ‘‘flown off the han-
dle.”

Then another Lambda Chi,
Herb Jennings, asked them to
leave. Germano said the Delts
left as a group and that he did
not hear any abusive phrases
yelled at the Lambda Chi’s.

(In previous testimony, the
Lambda Chi’s claimed that the
Delts had yelled obscenities at
the Lambda Chi’s when leaving.

None of the Delts said they
remembered any yelling by the
group. )

Romich commented that not
everything had been said. He
said he had been told that there
were Delts ‘‘dirty rushing” the
house. He said he was ‘‘afraid
they were going to start
something’’ and approached
some of the Delts.

Delt John Boger claimed that
it was then that Romich shoved
Germano. Romich denied this,
but did admit to calling Boger
‘“‘an asshole”’ and then apologiz-
ing and inviting them to stay.

John Kisalus, a Kappa Alpha,
testified that he saw the Delts
leave Lambda Chi and come
across the street to KA. He said
that he heard no yelling and
that none of the Delts seemed
obnoxious at the time. This was
contrary to testimony from
Lambda Chi at last week’s
hearing.

Lambda Chi Jennings then
testified that Delt Angus Finney
had yelled across the party,
“Come on everyone, the Delts
are getting out of here.” Finney
admitted to doing this, and
several Lambda Chi’s said that
his yell constituted a distur-
bance.

Delt Mike Foley asked,
‘“‘When you kick a bunch of guys
out of a house, how do you ex-
pect not to have a_ distur-
bance?’’ Finney added that he
did not see where the problem
lay, as he felt the two houses
were not competing during rush
and that the Delts were not try-
ing to “‘steal girls” (as Lambda
Chi charged) since the Delts
were not having a party that
night; they were just telling
girls about a party the next
week, Finney said.

this was the third time evidence
had been presented in this case,
and the delegations from Delt
and Lambda Chi left the room
so the Board could reach a deci-
sion.

IFC vice-president Rich Huek
started the discussion by say-
ing,’ ‘Frankly, I don’t see what
all the commotion was about.”’

Charles Terry said that as
had been pointed out before, the
two houses had different defini-
tions of behavior. Davis added
that the Board would have to
determine the extent of the
“ungentlemanly _conduct’’
charge.

Thistlethwaite noted the
discrepancies in the testimonies
from the two houses. Davis sup-
ported this by referring to con-
flicting testimony about yelling
at the party: the Lambda Chis
said there was, the Delts said
there was not.

Dean Murphy suggested a
revote, adding that any appeals
would go before the Student Af-
fairs Committee, a group made
up of administration, faculty,
and students. -

Chris Volk moved to keep the
fine as it stood, but Freddy
Moore disagreed, saying that
there was not “‘any solid basis
to lay a fine.”’

Volk replied that he felt
guests should keep manners

‘within the rules of the fraternity

they visit. Sid Farrar said he
felt the case was ‘“‘wishy-

washy.’’ Moore added that the
Board ‘‘can’t fine someone on

wishy-washy evidence.”’

The motion to retain the fine
was voted down, and Davis sug-
gested ‘‘making a warning so
we’ll have something to show.”
The Board decided that because
the Delts were invited they had
a right to be at the Lambda Chi
house, but that such action by
the Delts in the future will not
be tolerated in thefuture.

The Delts were ‘“‘reprimand-

ed” for ‘unruly behavior”
rather than ‘“ungentlemanly
behavior.” Davis explained

that the charge stemmed from
the ambiguities and discrepan-
cies in the testimony which

caused the Board to decide that
what occurred ‘‘was not so
ungentlemanly.”

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee can vote to hear a case after
reading a report from the IFC
or if one of the parties involved
appeals. Lambda Chi indicated
they they will appeal the deci-

sion.

The Judicial Board also
decided to send a letter to the
fraternities reminding them
that pledging activities, in-
cluding kidnapping and
‘trashing’ of rooms, are il-
legal in that the fraternities are
not allowed to do anything that
will interfere with a freshman’s

studying or life in the dorms.

parties have become the rage,
we must not forget that at least
one fraternity at W&L has been
staging its own toga party for
many millenia.

This film depicts college at-
mosphere as it was in 1962, yet
many viewers relate it to
modern college life, while
others react with disdain at the
fact that today’s students are
trying to act like people in 1962.
The point is that the film cap-
tures a way of life and a spirit
which could exist on any college
campus in any era.

Anybody who has ever heard
of college can appreciate the
humor of Animal House. John
Belushi, already a _ popular
figure from NBC’s Saturday
Night, steals the show. It’s hard
to tell where his character
separates from his actual per-
sonality. The college backdrop
is just a vehicle for Belushi, who
could get laughs in any situa-
tion.

The point is that Animal
House is one of those rare
movies which speaks to
everyone, not because of its
cinematic techniques (which
are very adequate) but because
of the fact that no matter what
college you go to, have been to,
or have even heard of, the
movie hits you right where
you live.

City Council Members
Meet With IFC on Noise

by Randy Smith
and Charles Tucker

“‘We come in peace,”’ said Dr.
Thomas C. Imeson, a member
of the Lexington City Council, to
fraternity presidents at Tues-
day night’s Interfraternity
Council meeting Members of
the City Council’s Public Safety
Committee met with IFC
representatives to discuss Lex-
ington’s noise ordinance and its
application to fraternity par-
ties.

“There’s no way the city of
Lexington can make any form
of commitment that would con-
travene the enforcement of one
of its ordinances,’ Imeson ex-
plained to the fraternity
presidents.

“We are not looking for con-
cessions from the fraternities,’’
said Imeson, ‘‘but a fair way to
accomodate the citizens of Lex-
ington,” including fraternity
members. ‘We came to hear
what you all feel about the cur-

“Frankly, your houses have
looked like hell,’’ he continued,
but he noted that there had been
a “marked” improvement in
their general appearance and
upkeep this year. Still, how the
community regards fraternities
is. “not something you turn
around overnight,” he added.
Dudley told the Council
members that the fraternities
and the city ‘‘are rapidly ap-
proaching a_ confrontation
crisis—either an officer getting

“The police department’s action is directly proportional

to the number of complaints they receive”
-Dr. Thomas C. Imeson
City Council member

 

The meeting between the city
and the fraternities came as a
result of an address delivered to
the City Council about one
month ago by Beau Dudley,
president of Washington and
Lee’s student body, offering
“concessions” to the city’s
noise ordinance in return for a
“relaxation” of the ordinance
during specific times.

Several fraternity presidents
have been summonsed to court
and one was arrested for viola-
tion of the noise statute which
forbids loud noise or stereo
music between the hours of 11
p.m. and7 a.m.

elections, clockwise from lef

In the ensuing conversation
between the _ fraternity
representatives and_ the
members of Council, Imeson
said that fraternities this year
were “paying for the sins’’ of
their “forebearers.” An_ in-
creased frequency of weeknight
parties and decline in the
general appearance of fraterni-
ty houses had lowered com-
munity respect for fraternities
as a group, he said.

Every time a police officer
enters a fraternity around
here,”’ Dudley said, ‘‘it’s like a
fuse ready to go off.”’

“The whole thing is snowball-
ing into cops verses students,
and the noise ordinance is at the
core of it,’ the student body
president continued.

‘“‘We’ve got to weigh
everybody in the balance and
strike a median,’’ Imeson
replied. ‘The police depart-
ment’s action is directly propor-
tional to the number of com-
plaints they receive,” he told

ress uesday night.

Dick Gregory speaks ’
on America’s “moral and
spiritual bankruptcy”

Comedian and political ac-
tivist Dick Gregory told an au-
dience in Washington and Lee
University’s Lee Chapel Tues-
day night that the United States
is suffering from a moral and
spiritual bankruptcy that
crosses racial and social lines.

The scope of Gregory’s talk
was broad, and his criticism
ranged from present day
morality to the Russians, the
whites, the blacks, big business,
our educational institutions,
organized crime, and big
government.

Gregory challenged his au-
dience to realize what kind of
power they possess to change
the conditions established by
the “‘rich, rich aristocrats.’”

“T really wonder what day
will you young folks realize how

much power you have,’
Gregory said, “‘and that all the
conditions (in the world) are be-
ing created by a bunch of old,
insane, pimp mentality folks;
that when you bring your thing
together, you really don’t have
to tolerate it.’

“‘One day when you really get
hip and decide that you’re not
going to let a handful of rich,
rich aristocrats manipulate
your head and determine when
you gonna die and how you gon-
na die and when nuke bombs
gonna fall and when they not
gonna fall, then they’ll stop it,’’
Gregory said.

The former comedian also
questioned today’s standards of
higher education. ‘Colleges are
too busy teaching students how

E.C. discusses
freshman election,

role of UCC-SAB

by Randy Smith

Irregularities in last week’s
freshman election were again
debated by the Executive Com-
mittee at Monday night’s
meeting. A motion to rescind at
least one of the run-off elections
was defeated by two votes.

Steve Abraham, junior class
representative to the E.C.,said
that he had seen a candidate for
the freshman E.C. position
“standing close to the balloting
area, telling people to vote for
him.” Abraham called the un-
named candidate’s action dur-
ing the run-off election last
Thursday ‘“‘an attempt to in-
fluence the voting process.”

Abraham said that both he
and Rob Neely, head of the
Voting Regulations Board, had
spoken to the candidate about

his solicitation of votes and had
told him that he could not be
near the polling area.

“This was a part of the voting
regulations,” Abraham said,
“and (thecandidate’s actions)
could have had an influence on
the elections.’’ He recommend-
ed that the freshman election
for their E.C. member “be
thrown out”’ on the basis of Will
Mackie’s argument last week
that a candidate for office has a
duty to know the rules of the
election as part of his “respon-
sibilities” for office.

Tom McCarthy, secretary of
the E.C., called Abraham’s pro-
posal ‘‘unreasonable.’’ The
established rule stating that a
candidate cannot be within 15
yards of the polling area was

Student Charged with

drug possession

A member of Pi Kappa Alpha
fraternity was arrested and
charged with possession of
marijuana last Wednesday by
Lexington police. A search of
the student’s room reportedly
produced two marijuana plants
and one and a half ounces of pot.

The crime is a misdemeanor
in Virginia.

Officer J.K. Colbert, who
made the arrest, was apparent-

ly issued a search warrant after
spotting the plants in a window
of the fraternity house from the
street. The evidence recovered
has been sent to a Roanoke lab
for evaluation, according to
Chief of Police J.A. Kirby.

Kirby denied that the arrest is
an indication of an ensuing
police crackdown on
Washington & Lee students.

IFC-Judicial Board

In the wake of the arrest of a
Washington and Lee student
and fraternity member on the
charge of possession of mari-
juana, the Interfraternity Coun-
cil’s Judicial Board determined
that the IFC has no jurisdiction
in drug-related cases. The inci-
dent was referred to the Student

Control Committee.

In another policy decision, the
Judicial Board upheld the pro-
hibition against fraternity
pledge ‘scavenger hunts’”’ out-
side Lexington’s city
limits.‘‘Hazing”’ of pledges was
also outlawed by the IFC.

written down, he said, but was
“unavailable” to the freshman
candidates.

“‘T don’t think we can take any
action against the candidate in
question,” said Rob Calvert,
senior E.C. representative.
“There’s no way of knowing if
every candidate was informed
(of the rule).”’ ;

“I know when I was there and
Rob Neely was there, we told
the candidates we saw (about
the 15 yard rule),’”’ Abraham
said.

“Overturning elections is
pretty serious business,” said
E.C. president Beau Dudley.
“Until we have done a better
job of informing candidates of
the rules, I have trouble over-
turning the election.”’

“‘T think we have to admit our
faults and let this one go,”
Calvert said.

“T can’t see the point of ad-
mitting a mistake and letting it
go,’’ Abraham countered.

Both Neely and Abraham
recommended that the election
be redone, but in the vote,
Abraham’s motion failed 4-6,
with the two new E.C.
members, Jenelle Mims and
Charlie Scott, abstaining.
Abraham, Rob Benfield, Bill

Tucker, and Bob Willis voted
for the motion.

In other action Monday night,
the E.C. decided that the
University Center Committee,
which books entertainment in
the Cockpit, should remain a
subcommittee of the Student
Activities Board and not
become an autonomous group.

The question of independence
for the UCC came up with
regard with a band booked for
the Cockpit by the SAB. Keith
Leeper, chairman of the UCC,
said his committee was “by-

passed’’ by the SAB in the book-
ing.

Leeper asked for
‘‘independence’’ and

“‘autonomy”’ for the UCC from
the SAB (which controls the
UCC’s $4,600 budget).

Doug Jackson, co-chairman
of the SAB, said “all I would
like to do is keep some authority
(over the UCC) with the SAB.”
He added, however, that ‘‘there
is no antagonism between the
University Center Committee
and the SAB.”

Bob’ Willis, sophomore
representative to the E.C.,
outlined the UCC’s problem as
he saw it: “We have one group
that has the money but no
power, and another group that

suspended all test-market
advertising and promotion of its
new soft drink, Chelsea, which
has drawn criticism for being a
“baby beer.” Lexington is
within the area where the

beverage is being test-
marketed.
Chelsea contains slightly less

than 0.5% alcohol, and is bottl-
ed, packaged, and colored like
beer. The drink has been widely
advertised in test-market areas
as the ‘“‘new not-so-soft drink.”’
The alcohol content is low
enough that it can be sold to per-
sons of any age.

‘Anheuser-Busch _ believes
strongly that the concept behind
the new soft drink Chelsea is
socially responsible and that it
fulfills a real need in the adult
beverage market,” the com-
pany said.

“I question the fact that they
(the UCC) are spending a large
amount of student funds and
I’m not sure the student body is
well represented on the UCC,”
Willis said.

Bill Tucker, vice-president of
the E.C., said he saw ‘‘a need
for the UCC to have the discre-
tion and the power to book

campus one of his most impor-
tant end-campaign §  ap-
pearances. Warner is a 1949

tivities. On Wednesdays at 4:30

the bumper-branding program
at Kroger will continue. The
committee will be leaving from

 

  

e student center foyer at
about 10 a.m.

Mock elections around
Virginia have been very suc-
cessful for John Warner.

 

Warner to Speak Nov. 2

William and Mary returned a
54% majority for John, while
Old Dominion University’s tally
was 68% Warner. Mary
Baldwin College gave him a
stunning 78% of the vote. With
victories at Clinch Valley and
Richard Bland _ colleges,
Warner’s record on college
campuses is an impressive
5-0-0.

At the Homecoming game,
the club collected over $73.00 for
the Lexington-Rockbridge
United Way. On Monday and
Tuesday of this week a suc-
cessful dorm collection project
was held, part of the continuing
effort of the club to become in-
volved in community activities
as well as political ones.

 

“Nevertheless, in the  in-
terests of corporate and social
responsibility, we have
suspended all test-marketing
advertising and promotion of
Chelsea, and we are studying
the possibility of overcoming
certain well-intentioned objec-
tions to the concept of the pro-
duct.”

Chelsea has been attacked in
some areas of Virginia by

nurses, clergy, and educators.

as a drink calculated to pro-
mote and condition beer drink-
ing among children.

The Secretary of Health, .

Education, and Welfare, Joseph
Califano, Jr., and Sen. Orrin
Hatch (R-Utah), a member of
the Senate subcommittee on
alcoholism, have also criticized
the drink.

Hatch said that the beverage
was the brewery’s attempt to
convert children into “a new

bands in the Cockpit.”

Calvert disagreed, saying
that “to solidify the overall
entertainment for the student
body, formal approval (of
Cockpit entertainment) should
remain with the SAB.”

“T think we should keep it (the
UCC) within the SAB because
the SAB was carefully chosen so
that it would represent a con-
sensus of the entertainment opi-
nions” contained in the entire
student body. ‘You're going to
run into problems of having two
entertainment committees on.
campus,” he added.

Beau Dudley ended the
discussion by making a motion
for the University Center Com-
mittee to have “‘full authority”
for Cockpit entertainment. In
the vote, however, Dudley voted
against his own motion, helping
to defeat it 3-8, and keeping the
UCC a “‘subdivision”’ of the Stu-
dent Activities Board.

John Murphy, senior law
school representative to the
E.C., then motioned that the
UCC retain its authority to book
entertainment in the Cockpit
with the SAB’s approval. The
motion passed 9-1-2.

Athough there has not been

Lexington, the towns of Staun-

conventional positions can be
picked up from the
receptionist at the University
Center (Carole Chappell), the
receptionist at the entrance of
Washington Hall, and at the cir-
culation desk of the Law School
library. Offices are open to all
students except seniors and
third-year law students. The ap-
plications will ask basic in-
formation including any related
experience the applicant has
had, and a description of the
jobs available.

 

Among those jobs available
are:

—regional coordinators: There
are four coordinators (East,
South, Midwest, and West) who
will be responsible for monitor-
ing research and political work
in the states of their region.

—state chairmen: The state
chairmen will be responsible

How would Einstein
theorize about O’Keefe?

Although the O'Keefe formula is secret, certain factors in the

_ equation are well known:

1. O'Keefe has a hearty, full-bodied flavor.
2. It is smooth and easy going down.

3. Its head commands respect.

Our theory is that Einstein would have concluded: /t's too good to

 

 

gulp. Relatively speaking, of course.

 

 

 

A. Walton Litz, chairman of
the Department of English at
Princeton University, will visit
Washington and Lee University
next Thursday and Friday
(Nov. 2-3) as W&L’s 1978-79 Phi
Beta Kappa Scholar.

During his stay at
Washington and Lee, Dr. Litz
will deliver a lecture, ‘The
Meaning of ‘Modernism’,’’ at 8
p.m. Thursday (Nov. 2) in Lee
Chapel on the university’s front
campus. He will conduct an
open class on “modern” poetry
Friday (Nov. 3) at 12:30 p.m. in
Payne Hall. The public is in-
vited to both events.

In his Phi Beta Kappa lec-
ture, Dr. Litz will attempt to
define ‘‘modernism’’ in British
and American literature by
comparing the earlier view of it
as a ‘‘revolutionary’’
phenomenon with the more re-
cent scholarly inclination to
stress the -lines of continuity
between 20th-century writers
and their 19th-century

teaching at Princeton in 1956.
He advanced to professor of
English in 1968 and has been
chairman of the department
since 1975. He was a Fellow of
the American Council of Learn-
ed Societies and was awarded
the Danforth Foundation’s Har-
bison Award for Gifted
Teaching in 1972. During 1974-75
he held a National Endowment
for the Humanities Senior
Fellowship.

His books include ‘‘The Art of

Musical “Mainsiieam

by Mark Mainwaring and Robin Meredith

Pittsburg’s Stanley Theatre
— Sunday, Oct. 22. The lights
dim as the opening act takes the
stage, and a nondescript man
steps shyly forward to in-
troduce the band. He looks not
at all sure he wants to be here in
front of all these people.

“Hello, my name is Peter,”’
he says quietly. ‘‘I’ll be on ina
little while but first I want to in-
troduce you to a remarkable
group of musicians — Jules and
the Polar Bears.”’ The an-
nouncer is walking off the stage
‘by the time the crowd realizes
that he’s the headline act, the
man they’ve all paid to see.

Such is the unique fame of
Peter Gabriel. While his name
isn’t yet a household word, he is
known by many as the former
lead singer for the supergroup
Genesis.

Since his split from that band
three years ago (which many
observers wrongly predicted
would cause both parties to
wither and die), Gabriel has
begun to establish himself as a
solo artist with two album
releases and several tours, the
latest of which brought him to
the Stanley Theatre in Pitt-
sburgh last Sunday.

Gabriel has a stage presence
nothing short of riveting. Even
during the softer songs and un-
familiar numbers, the 3000-plus
crowd could not help but give its
full attention — perhaps
because it never knew what
he’d do next.

The show began as he walked
almost unnoticed from the back
of the hall to the stage, climbed
up, and sat at the piano — all
with the house lights still full on.
After a humorous solo rendition
of one of his childhood songs,
the show’s star announced that
it was time to “search for the
musicians.”

The lights went out. An eerie
green strobe flashed under the
stage, and equally eerie music
(from Synergy’s Chords) came
out over the speakers. Five
figures appeared one by one in
the audience and walked slowly
to the stage, each swinging a
lantern back and forth as he
moved. The show was ready to
begin.

An imaginative opening to
say the least, and it worked.
Peter Gabriel had grabbed the
audience visually and emo-
tionally, and he wasn’t about to
let go. The band opened with a
powerful rendition of ‘‘On the
Air” and never let up in intensi-
ty.

The concert featured most of
the songs from each of
Gabriel’s two solo albums (both
called Peter Gabriel), including
outstanding verions of ‘“‘Modern
Love,’’ ‘‘Solsbury  Hill,”’
“D.1.Y.,’’ and (surprisingly)
“White Shadow.” The highlight
of the show came as the singer
left the stage during the piano
intro to the bluesy ‘‘Waiting for
the Big One,” apparently to
take a quick break.

Just as the vocals were to
begin, a single spotlight cut to
the middle of the audience to
show a smiling Gabriel, sitting
serenely in a chair with his arm

around the girl next to him. He
sang most of the song from the

audience, using a cordless mike
and without missing a beat.

The band finally left the stage
to an ecstatic response, then
came back for the obligatory
encore — one area where I feel
the show could have been bet-
ter. “Lamb Lies Down On
Broadway” seemed an un-
necessary concession to the
Genesis-only fans in the au-
dience, where ‘‘Down The Dolce
Vita” would have been at least
as effective.

Gabriel and company said
good night once more, the house
lights went on...and the crowd
wouldn’t leave. The band finally
returned to perform the very
mellow ‘‘Here Comes the
Flood,” and that was it. A first
class back-up band, a
phenomenal performer, im-
aginative staging, and even
(you thought it wasn’t possible)
good sound — Peter Gabriel is a
man to watch for, and his is a
show not tobe missed. M.M.:

The All-Stars

If you have been at all im-

pressed by what you’ve been,

reading — or perhaps hearing
— about the debut album by the
Allstars (Tip Your Waitress, on
Adelphi Records), you owe it to
yourself to see them live in the
Cockpit this Friday night.
Neither their album, which is
somewhat thinly produced and

All that jazz

by Spencer Leffel

Chick Corea: Friends
Polydor PD-1-6160

Chick Corea is best known for
the jazz-rock he created with
his Return to Forever groups
during the 1970s. Less well
known are Corea’s roots in
straight jazz. He rose to pro-
minence with Miles Davis in the
late 1960’s before recording
some free jazz with people like
Woody Shaw and Dave Holland

at the very end of the decade.

 

 

Russian poet reads

Andrei Voznesensky, one of the top two con-
temporary Russian poets, will be at W&L on
Tuesday, Oct. 31. He will be in the Bookstore
signing copies of his latest English translation,
Nostalgia for the Present, from 3 p.m. until clos-
ing. At 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel he will read from his
poetry and the visit will conclude with a recep-
tion following the reading, in the Alumni House.
Voznesensky’s appearance is sponsored by the
Glasgow Endowment Committee.

The reading promises to be both unique and ex-
citing. Voznesensky regularly reads to packed
stadiums across the Soviet Union; his books sell
upwards of a hundred thousand copies,
demonstrating his accessibility to those not
steeped in poetic traditions.

The poet throws himself into his readings,
making them into dramatic recitals. His poems
are fresh and energetic; they become
monuments to the living human spirit, as they
condemn the petty materialism that pervades
modern life. In a political sense, they are neither
denunciations nor glorifications of the Soviet
State.

He is not interested in making political
statements, only artistic comments on the
human condition. In the poem “Provincial
Scene”’ he tells the story of a poor, unmarried
peasant women, who struggles through a life of
servitude so that her son can live well.

In the end her son kills her, and stuffs her body
down the toilet. The poem is told as a conversa-
tion between the poet and a friend who had slept
with the woman, and later reviled her as simple-
minded and loose.

“The whole town came to her funeral.

They guessed who'd done it. Suspecting him,

they said: ‘Kiss your mother’;

he refused.

And it was then that they found him out.

But he would not say who his accomplices had
been.”

“You were the killer!” I said to my friend.

Yes, Annie, you drowned in our minds

between news reports and dirty jokes...

heaven and hell do not exist—

you drift somewhere in between. Who are you now
in your new hierarchy?

Voznesensky draws heavily on irony to ridicule
the petty and the materialistic. Describing a
technological exchange between the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R.:

We send them our best ballerinas
and get Pepsi-Cola in return...
I long for plumbing and freedom of thought.

In “The Feast’ he tells of a man who takes
food to his animal friends in the forest: a jelly
roll, a tangerine, and vodka. They refuse to eat
these, and decide to eat him instead. He quickly
convinces them that that would be the wrong
thing to do:

“In the morning I down a demitasse

of vodka, the news from TASS,

two plates, two papers, two casseties,

a colleague from work, two apples for dessert .
dipped in DDT.

And then somebody
sits in my liver chain-smoking Gauloises.
Enough cigarettes to kill
forty thousand horses a day.

You want all that nicotine, what do you say?”

Voznesensky comments on his failure to attain
the suggested poetic output for those in his
Poetic Federation in a poem called ‘‘An Ironical
Elegy Born in Those Most Distressing Moments
When...One Cannot Write.’’ Unlike the
stereotypical poetry reading, where the poet
drones monotonously about some esoteric sub-
ject, Voznesensky promises to be good entertain-
ment; he will also show us a side of Russian life
that is sorely neglected in this age of super-
power politics.

by Tom Helscher

 

 

During this free period Corea
met saxophonist-flutist Joe Far-
rell, who subsequently played in
the original Return To Forever
and has recorded with Corea off
and on throughout the seven-
ties.

Corea’s new album Friends
brings the two artists together,
along with bassist Eddie Gomez
and drummer Steve Gadd, in an
accoustic setting that produces
a reassertion of Corea’s jazz
roots.

Farrell’s long association
with Corea is very evident on
Friends. His solos show an
understanding of Corea’s har-
monic and rhythmic ideas that
is surpassed only by Corea
himself.

The improvisational in-
terplay between the two is at
times intricate but never con-
fused; perhaps the best exam-
ple of this interplay occurs in
the title track, a song
highlighted by Farrell’s lovely
flute.

Gomez and Gadd are a
stimulating and _ creative
rhythm section. They can swing
hard and they can play mellow,
but they never get overly
repititive.

Gomez’s accoustic bass tone
is somewhat reminiscent of
Stanley Clarke’s, but his style is
his own. Gomez solos crisply in
five of the album’s eight songs,
his best work coming in the title
track. Gadd is simply brilliant.
His spare, subtle style com-
piements perfectly Corea’s soft
but rhythmically dynamic
music.

Gadd shows that the creative
possibilities of a simple drum
set are endless, particularly in
his cymbal work. The rhythms
of this album are not free; Gadd
plays with them imaginatively
withuout losing them.

The compositions here are
strong, and they all carry the
melodic stamp of Corea, one of
the most distinctive composers
in music today.

Jazz-rock elements can be
found on this album, but overall
this is the most uninhibited jazz
to come from Corea in years.
Dedicated to the musician’s
friends, this is a brilliant album
of happily expressive music.
 

First Portrait of Oriel Ross,

1925; 21”

Many Americans know the
names of nineteenth-century
Russian novelists such as
Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and
possibly have read Anna
Karenina or Crime and Punish-
ment. Theater buffs are certain
to be familiar with one or more
of Chekhov’s plays. Yet
relatively few readers outside
the Soviet Union are aware of
Russia’s distinguished poetic
tradition, which reaches back to
Pushkin and Lermontov in the
earlier 1800s and includes in
more recent times
Mayakovksy, Mandelstam, and
Pasternak.

Vosnesensky’s
Influences

It was Pasternak who, toward
the end of his life, became an in-
spiration for a young poet nam-
ed Andrei Voznesensky. During
the past fifteen or so year
Voznesensky has become for his
many readers the best contem-
porary Soviet poet. He has also
read his poems to thousands in
the USSR and to numerous au-
diences in the United States. Ac-

The new show in duPont Gallery, an exhibit of the sculpture of the late Jacob Epstein, will open on
Monday, Oct. 30 and continue through Nov. 21. The exhibit is accompanied by a film on Epstein and his
work, which will be shown on each Monday evening during the show at 7 and 7:30 p.m.

The collection of 35 bronzes has been lent by the Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C., for a
traveling exhibition sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution. These bronzes reflect not only the in-
fluence of African art on Epstein, but also the way he incorporated the character and achievements of
the sitter into the sculpture. The exhibit will include his sculptures of Haile Selassie, T.S. Eliot, and Paul
Robeson, which will indicate why he won such great attention and fame as a portraitist.

cording to reports, he reads or
recites his works with the skill
of a true actor. His poetry (it
has been remarked) reflects a
“mixture of whimsy and
seriousness,” and is concerned
with a broad range of aspects of
the Russian and American
scene.

Glasgow Invitation

Mr. Voznesensky has been in-
vited to our campus by the
Glasgow Endowment Commit-
tee. He receites in Russian, of
course, but each poem will first
be read in English translation
by Professor Boatwright.

The poet, W.H. Auden, once
wrote that although he himself
knew no Russian, Vozensen-
sky’s poems, even in transla-
tion, had much to say to him. I
think you will enjoy seeing and
hearing an outstanding and
real, live Russian poet. The
place is Lee Chapel and the date

One thing that every grit
respects is bravery, and when
exceptional acts of bravery oc-
cur, grits love to hear about it.
With this in mind, this weeks
column concerns the fierce bat-
tle between two of my room-
mates, PS and JR, and a
cockroach.

THe battle lines were drawn
about one in the morning when
JR, talking on the phone, was
confronted by a cockroach at
PS’s door. Apparently the roach
was sneaking up on PS who was
studying in his room.

But the ever alert JR sounded
the alert by means of an ef-
feminate scream and then the
battle began in earnest. The
cockroach was both wily and
ruthless and had it not been for
the competent leadership of PS
(of whom the ROTC depart-
ment can be proud) the death
toll could have been much
higher.

With only an occasional out-
burst of terror, PS calmly and
cooly directed his army, JRS,
from a safe distance, of course.

Some of you may not realize
it, but the Ariel offers many op-
portunities for participation by
Washington and Lee students.
The most outstanding op-
portunity is, of course, that of
having something you have
written, drawn, or photograph-
ed published in a magazine
which is widely distributed
within the W&L community.
Any works of poetry, prose (fic-
tion or non-fiction), or graphic
arts are heartily welcome for
consideration.

There is also the opportunity
to work on Ariel staff. Whether
you write or not, you can benefit
Ariel by offering your

Ariel staffers will also have
the opportunity to participate in
readings to be arranged with
selected girls schools in the
area.

Finally, the most important
opportunity is that of develop-
ing the potential of Ariel to its
fullest. This opportunity can on-

Water Polo team
goes 10-2

by Sam Campbell

Washington and Lee’s Water
Polo Generals raised their
record to 10-2 following their 4-1
weekend.

The team opened action with
a 15-1 victory over VMI, with
Keith Romich and Biff Martin
scoring five goals each. Then
the Generals traveled to Rich-
mond for their second Southern
League Tournament in three
weeks. Martin and Romich split
ten goals again as W&L handily
defeated the Richmond “B”
team 14-3. Lynchburg College
was the next opponent, and the
Generals had little trouble with
them as W&L won, 14-1. Martin
had four goals, Romich three’
and seven other players had one
goal each, in the most diverse
scoring game of the season. In
W&L’s 17-11 victory over James
Madison, Martin and Romich
each had five goals, and Bob
Newcomb and Drew Pillsbury
had three goals each in a hard-
fought battle.

The Richmond game was the
most physical of the year so far

for the Generals as they came
out on the short side of a 16-7
score. Romich had four goals
and Pillsbury two, while the
W&L swimmers suffered six
stitches and a chipped tooth. As
for the Richmond game, Coach
Bill Stearns had little to say, ex-
cept ‘We were just beaten by a
better team. We gave it our
best, thought.”

W&L was hampered by in-
juries throughout the tourna-
ment, and generally the
replacements played excep-
tionally well under pressure.
One notable performer was Bill
Meyer, who filled in as goalie
for Will Hodges, who is out for
the rest of the season. Stearns
had nothing but praise for
Meyer’s play, and pointed out
that he had had very little play-
ing experience before this
weekend. Meyer was very solid
in the goal, and even con-
tributed two goals during the
weekend.

This week the team returns to
Richmond for the Southern

(continued on page 7)

game of the year, committing
eight turnovers. They were still
able to win, however, thanks to
a missed Sewanee extra point
and some defensive heroics late
in the game. ‘‘Our defense was
definitely the difference in the
game,” said Fallon. ‘They
were able to rise to each
challenge, and they never got
upset.”’

Offensively, the Generals
showed moments of brilliance
and moments of bleakness.
Stewart Atkinson was sensa-
tional in rushing 23 times for 165
yards and two touchdowns, but
he also fumbled twice. In fact,
the entire backfield was
plagued with fumbilitis. Atkin-
son fumbled twice, and fullback
Jim Palermo fumbled once.
One of these fumbles stopped
W&L at the Sewanee 10, while
another fumble gave Sewanee
the ball at the W&L 18, with six
minutes left in the game and
W&L ahead 14-13.

Despite the turnovers, the of-
fense had its most productive
game of the season. W&L rolled
up 325 yards overall, and
Stewart Atkinson’s 59 yard
touchdown run was the longest
play from scrimmage this year.
Atkinson’s touchdown runs of 59
yards and 16 yards were the
type of big play that the offense
has lacked all year.

The game, however, was
determined by the W&L

by Bill Whalen

It was business as usual for Gary Fallon on
Tuesday morning. He was assembled with
various assistants, reviewing last Saturday’s
game. The only difference between this session
and others, was that Fallon could enjoy this film.
Last Saturday, Coach Gary Fallon won his first
game as a W&L football coach. ‘I am very hap-
py about the outcome,” said Fallon. ‘‘It was not a
very pretty game, but when you are 0-6, you can-

not afford to be particular.”

The 14-13 victory over Sewanee is the first
reward Fallon has received since taking over at
W&L. Before this season started, Fallong was
seen as the saviour to a program that had not had
a winning season since 1967. Therefore, when the
Generals dropped their first six games, many
fans were disappointed. Fallon, however, re-
mained optimistic. “I only felt disappointed
when we lost a game that we should have won,”

said Fallon.

The season started disastrously for Fallon.
The score of the first two games were 49-7 and
34-7. Then suddenly, the Generals regrouped.

They were to suffer four more losses, but none

ed from them.

were lopsided. ‘‘I felt that we had chance to win
each of those games,’’ said Fallon. ‘We could
see our mistakes from each game, and we learn-

Perhaps the most amazing thing about Fallon
has been his refusal to let the pressure get to him
during this losing streak. ‘If I am upset on the
field, I think it over before I go home. My family
gives me good support, so I try not to let my job

affect my home life.”

Coach Fallon was obviously satisfied with his
first win, but he won’t let it affect this week’s
practice. ‘‘We took Monday off because a lot of
the players were tired. Otherwise, nothing has
been different.”

Fallon was not interested in predicting how the
rest of the season would progress. He was too
busy getting his team ready for this week’s oppo-
nent, Bridgewater College. ‘‘I do not like to look

ahead or look behind,’ said Fallon. ‘‘Right now,

the toughest team is the next one on the
schedule.”’ This is an old cliche, but, then again,
Gary Fallon is an old-fashioned coach.

14-13 victory over Sewanee. W&L takes on Bridgewater Saturday.

defense. In the fourth quarter
alone, W&L made Sewanee
fumble twice. One of these
fumbles was on the W&L 10, and
was recovered by Car] Folcik,
defensive player of the game.
Folcik also made 17 tackles.
The defense stopped Sewanee
-five times in the fourth quarter,
three in W&L territory.

This Saturday’s opponent is
Bridgewater College. The

students, and W&L fraternities,
all of which gave $36 a piece.
The coordinator of the run,
Bob Bates, explained that every
female runner was supposed to
run one mile while every female
runner ran five miles. This was
not the case however. Bates
said that ‘‘the race was terrific.
The guys ran much more than
the five miles expected of
them.” Bates also said that the
girls did a good job too. “In
many instances, the girls
outran the guys,” he stated. In
fact one girl, Mary Ellen Bon-
tonne, ran 25 miles altogether.
Bates went on to say that his

Eagles, losers last week to
Emory & Henry 27-20, are an in-
jury depleted team. ‘They lost
their best quarterback and they
do not have much depth,” said
Fallon. “We beat them 33-13
last year,”’ stated the coach,
“and they should be mad. It will
be a tough game, but we are
capable of beating them.”’

Gametime on Saturday is 2
p.m. at Bridgewater.

conception of the Sweet Briar
girl had changed. ‘‘They really
had a profeessional attitude
about the whole thing.”’

A casual atmosphere existed
throughout the race. Bates said
that the atmosphere was casual
although the pace was fast. He
went on to say that “the
weather was just perfect, and
we all had a great time.”’

Top finishers for the girls
were Robin Bain, who also
helped organize the run,
Elizabeth Webster, Lynn Wes-
tiene, and Le Le Black. All of
W&L’s cross country team par-

Soccer Generals
lose 4-0, 3-2,
home Saturday

by Tim Connors

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team lost both games last
week, but played a lot better
than the scores of the games in-
dicate. An inability to capitalize
on scoring chances was once
again the Generals’ main short-
coming.

Last Wednesday W&L hosted
James Madison University and
lost by a score of 4-0. Coach Rolf
Piranian said that the Generals
“played right with” the Dukes,
but a strange goal with 30
seconds remaining in the first
half proved to be the game win-
ner. Sophomore goalie Kevin
Carney allowed only one more
goal while in the game.
Freshman John Guest replaced
Carney and allowed the final
two goals. Carney has now
allowed 9 goals in 18 games, for
a very respectable 2.0 goals-
against average. Piranian was
displeased with the Generals’
“inability to capitalize on many
scoring chances,” a aoe
which has plagued the W&L
booters all season long.

Against Roanoke College,
however, the Generals played a
very impressive second half,
but it was too little, too late.
Roanoke scored three goals in a
sloppily played first half, as the
Generals could not get anything
going on offense or defense. The
second half belonged entirely to
W&L, however, as the Generals
held Roanoke to four shots on
goal while taking 30. Piranian
said that W&L played “brilliant
soccer in the second half, com-
pletely dominating the play.”
He went on to say that the
Generals ‘‘had (our) chances to
score, and never quit, having to
come back from a three goal
deficit” and falling just short,
losing 3-2. Senior midfielder

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Dance marathon at W&L?

After years of tremendous success on other college
campuses, it looks like the idea of a Muscular
Dystrophy ‘‘Dance Marathon”’ is taking root at W&L.
Under the leadership of campus chairman Jay
Blumberg, administration approval has been secured
and a tentative date has been set. Hopefully, the final
result will be a 30-hour event (including a six-hour
break) on the weekend of March 16-17, two weeks
after Fancy Dress.

Blumberg has alread established the general for-
mat for the dance. Continuous music will be played,
with as many live bands as possible. Contestants will
solicit pledges of funds for every hour they dance; a
$30 minimum has been set for each person to gain ad-
mission. Also, conferences are now underway with
Jerry Darrell of Evans Dining Hall to get the use of
that facility for the weekend.

Even so, a massive effort is still ahead if the
marathon idea is to succeed. Blumberg will be
holding an organizational meeting for everyone in-
terested in working on the project next Monday, Oct.
30, at 7:30 p.m. in Room 114 of the University Center.
Involvement from the community is also encouraged.

It’s an exciting idea: a charitable event that ap-
peals to W&L’s innate preference for a long, intense
party. We wish Blumberg and company the best of
luck in the months of planning to come. Above all, we
urge the student body to support the event by atten-
ding Monday’s meeting. Quite simply, nothing like
this has ever been attempted on such a grand scale at
W&L. If it succeeds, there will finally be another
bright spot in those dismal winter weeks...

MGC

Death of the “burn-out”

The execution was accomplished so quietly that
there was hardly any notice taken. Even so, all of you
who lost your breath (or your lunch) during those
physical education running tests in your freshman
year may rest assured that they are a thing of the
past. Effective immediately, the P.E. department

has dropped the 12-minute, mile-and-a-half ‘‘burn -

out’”’ from its list of requirements. Only the swimming
test has been retained.

Why the axe-job, after all these years? For some
time, many students have viewed these tests as an in-
convenience, at best. Others have expressed stronger
resentment, asserting that these are merely attempts
to provoke nausea among the students. But those
rows of greenish faces made little or no impact upon
the P.E. staff.

In fact, student displeasure played no part at all in
the department’s decision. What turned the tide was a
growing threat of lawsuits and litigation. W&L
medical records are not famed for their exhaustive
detail, and many students who shouldn’t have run
were recently told to do so — including a diabetic and
an open-heart surgery patient. A few more of these
mistakes, and things could have gotten pretty sloppy,
to say the least.

So the student body will have to get along without
the “burn-out.”’ One of W&L’s most vividly
remembered traditions has gone up in smoke. And on
a campus where tradition reigns supreme, isn’t it sur-

prising that no one is mourning this time?

I do not request by this letter
a correction; I just wanted you
to be aware of the error. There
are, however, many other
Southerners who would not be
so understanding. They would
sue you, the Phi, W&L, and no
doubt ask for your head on a
platter.

Please be careful from now
on when reporting the bir-
thplace of our Southern
brethren. Telling a Rebel that
he is a Yankee is tantamount to
calling ‘‘Prissy’’ simple-
minded. I for one would not like
to lose the best editor we’ve had
for a long time to an old-style,
but most effective, lynching,
the victim of which would be
hung from the spire of Lee

of our revered leader.

Most sincerely,

COURSE 101: PREMATURE
PARENTHOOD — Prerequisite:
Irresponsible Sex. It’s a snap
course. Pass or fail. No exams,
term papers, not even any classes.
All that’s required is complacency
about your own sexuality and a
basic naivete that’s sure to keep
you from being in control of your
sex life.

Women will learn to shorten
their college years considerably
and reduce lifetime earning
power substantially through the
birth of an unwanted child or deal
with choices, such as abortion or
_ early marriage.

Men will explore the joint
decision-making process on
issues such as abortion, marriage,
paternity, etc., perhaps ultimately
experiencing the opportunity of
learning to deal effectively with
irate parents, social pressure,

fatherhood, divorce, child sup-

port and so forth.

The foregoing course descrip-
tion is fictitious. It is an attempt
to raise the sub rosa issue of
premarital sex and to call atten-
tion to the fallacy that ostrich-
like behavior will eliminate
having to deal with the danger
of unplanned or unwanted
pregnancy. To bury one’s head

in the proverbial sand most
assuredly will not eliminate
that possibility and, with the
ostrich as a mascot, one day
your luck is apt to fly right out
the window.

The focus of attention ap-
pears to have shifted in recent
years from the sexual behavior
of college students toward that
of teenagers in general and of

 

younger teenagers in par-
ticular, thus statistics regar-
ding intercourse on campus
(which are notoriously difficult
to estimate) are not very cur-
rent. Nevertheless, in the early
part of this decade, it was
estimated that on a national
average about 65 percent of
male college students engage in

“coitus” and about 50 percent of
the college women.

Perhaps you’ve heard about
Semicid Vaginal Contraceptive
Suppositories, which contains a
powerful spermicide called
nonoxynol-9; and you probably
already know that it’s about one
inch long, can be purchased
without prescription and is ef-
fective within minutes after in-
sertion. Perhaps, on the other
hand, you’re really not sure
which days of the month are
“safe” or whether there is such
a thing as a “male” pill and a
“morning after” pill.

In any case, the New York
Times points out (as recently as

Furthermore, it is believed that
one out of every ten teen-age
girls aged 15 or over in the U.S.
will become pregnant this year ;
and roughly 30 percent will bear

The Ring-tum Phi, Oct. 26, 1978, Page 9

College birth control:the ostrich as mascot:

once was and that motherhood
is subconsciously desirable as a
substitute identity and rite of
passage into adulthood. One
woman’s magazine indicates
that “many girls think that sex
should be spontaneous and that
contraception would make it
calculated and unromantic.”’
Apparently confirming this
lace of responsible sexual
behavior at the college level,
Richard Hettlinger points out in
this book, Sex Isn’t That Sim-
ple, that ‘Men often assume
quite wrongly that any girl who
agrees to heavy petting or inter-
course has automatically equip-
ped herself for casual sexual ac-
tivity. Many fail to check that
their partner is protected, and
some couldn’t care less whether
she is or not. Some men and
women assume that because
abortion is available as a last
resort, there’s no reason to

worry about pregnancy, ignor-
ing the fact that abortion is
never just a matter of a simple
visit to the doctor’s office.”’

But in defense of collegiate
morals, Hettlinger concludes,
“Unwanted pregnancies (at
least among college students)
are much more likely to occur if
a couple is struggling to avoid
intercourse than if they have
accepted it. Babies are often
conceived because the parents,
not wanting to admit their
desire or accept responsibility
for their actions, failed ‘on prin-
ciple’ to take adequate precau-
tions and were carried away by
passion. It is not the pro-
miscuous who get caught, but
the idealists who discover (too
late) that they were not able to
control their sexual needs and
then find their marriage star-,
ting out with the heavy burden
of the unwanted child.”’

campus Monday at about 1:30
p.m. They inspected the troubl-
ed computer all day Tuesday
and finished Wednesday morn-
ing.

Dr. Thomas Imeson, head of
the Computer Center, will not
comment on the findings until
the company sends him an of-
ficial report, which should come
within the week.

The report

In the report the Harris Cor-
poration will make recommen-
dations as to what should be
done about the problems with
the computer.

According to Imeson the next
step will be to present these
recommendations to the
University Council. Until the
Council discusses the recom-
mendations, no real action can
be taken, Imeson said.

After the U.C. decides what to
do, then the Harris Corporation
will be notified of their course of
action. Imeson said that the
whole process could take a
month.

Harris: a Beginner

The Harris Corporation is a
company of many inconsisten-
cies in procedure, according to
Mr. William Hartbarger, the
Computer Operator.

As a result of these factors
Washington and Lee’s com-
puter system is not the only one
with difficulty. The University
of Vermont is also experiencing
troubles with their Harris
System, states Hartbarger.

Further, according to Mr. O.
Lee Dudley, Director of Data
Processing and Administrative
Work, ‘“‘when our represen-
tative went to test some pro-
grams on a Harris system in
Arkansas, the test computer
was ‘down’ or not operating pro-
perly.” a

According to Dudley, Harris’
control of the computer in-
dustry is less than one percent,
compared to the I.B.M. Cor-
poration’s control of about

ey Ce.

This means that the students
taking computer programing on
the Harris computer will be
hurt, because of the ‘‘basic”’ dif-
ferences between programs on
the Harris and those of the more
common I.B.M., states Dudley.

Because Harris is a beginner
in the field, they lack the right
personnel to properly handle
complex situations, states Hart-
barger.

As with any company, the
Harris Corporation had chang-
ed personnel since the Harris
125 model (owned by W&L)
came out. In these changes the
original designer of the 125 left
Harris, Hartbarger said. This
fact affects W&L and any other
user of this model.

In most computer companies,
the designer leaves behind ex-
plicit directions of how to
operate and repair his com-
puter. But, according to Hart-
barger, this did not happen in
the case of the 125.

Thus, the Harris Corporation

Phineas:

 

people had to fill in the gaps by

themselves. As a result, the
software man’s documentation
is incomplete.

Finally, another problem
within the Harris Corporation is
changes in the 125’s programm-
ing. Hartbarger says that the

es in computer “soft-

ware’’ are so fast that the com-

pany does not-have enough staff
to handle these changes.

Next week there will be a
behind-the-scenes look into the
1130, still an important tie to the
Harris Computer.

More about “penguins”’

The following is an interview
with Dr. Sigmund Mirth, noted
psychologist, head shrinker,
witch doctor, and dabbler in
cannibalism. (‘If you can’t
cure ’em, eat ‘em. Got to keep
up that 100% effectiveness
rating.’’)

Phineas: Last time, Dr.
Mirth, I mentioned a research
paper on Abnormal
Endearments Among Penguins.
I know that you are considered
an expert in the field having
written your book, Penguins:
The Formal Attire Syndrome.
Would you tell us something
about these feathered fugitives
from Frenchie’s Formal Fair
Rentals?

Dr. Mirth: Sure. It all stems
from early childhood. (Almost
all psychological problems do,
you know.) The father is runn-
ing around in his chic tuxedo for
as long as the little guy can
remember. Since he’s in com-
petition with his father for his
mother’s affections, he-feels he
has to dress up also.

It is interesting to note that
one can seen an annual visita-
tion of this affliction to the city
of Lexington in the middle of
February. It includes thrashing
around on the floor in convul-
sions amongst others with the
same disease, an irresistable
craving for the Big Band Era
(so what if it’s Duke Ellington’s
step-son twice removed?) and a
sudden loss of memory as to
how to go about anything in the
realm of intellectual endeavor,
the University Council not-

withstanding.

Releated to this mental ill-
ness among the penguins is the
Cat and Mouse Complex. With
polar bears roaming Antarctica
you might be wondering why
penguins run around in their
black tuxedos which makes
them stand out from the snow-
white background?

It’s quite simple; they love to
flirt with doom, not unlike the
freshman who puts off his term
paper until the night before it’s
due, the sophomore who decides
to double-major in accounting

and pre-med, the junior who is
sleeping with two girls who just
happen to be roommates
unaware of the other’s noc-
turnal activities, or the senior
who doesn’t have his physical
education requirements com-
pleted by graduation and has
duped himself into believing
that the guy in charge of such
things will show a thimbleful of
mercy.

If you know anyone with these
mental disorders, write to me in
care of the Fencing team: ‘“‘We
aim to maim.”

to make a living and do not
teach students how to live,”’ he
said. He continued by saying
that people are_ too
materialistic, valuing their pro-
perty more than they value
their lives.

‘‘One day, when you
youngsters really dwell in
truth,” Gregory said, ‘‘most of
your major institutions (of lear-
ning) will have to close down or
straighten up. That’s the day
these colleges and universities
will have to be oases of love in-
stead of cesspools of hate.”’

Gregory, who participated in
the civil rights protests of the
1960s, spoke proudly of the
movement:

“I hope one day this country
will get enough integrity and be
mature enough to be honest
about what we black folks did in
the ‘60s,” he said. ‘Never
before in the ‘history of this
planet can you find records to
match the beauty of our
movement, and yet, white folks
just took the attitude that the
communists were behind it.”

Yet Gregory said that despite
past injustices committed
against blacks by whites, he
bares no malaise against
“white folks.”

“‘We black folks still have our
hands out,” he said. ‘“‘One day
we’re going to put our hands in
our pockets, and when that day
comes, you white folks in
America will have lost the only
true friend you had.”’

Stating that he was aware
that his scrutiny of events

might be a bit cynical, Gregory
drew parallels between the
timing of the railroad and New
York newspaper strikes and the
testimony now being given to
the House committee in-
vestigating the assassinations
of John F. Kennedy and Martin
Luther King, Jr.

He inferred that important
testimony was not covered
adequately by the national
press, as the strikes demanded
more attention. The selectivity
of the press is not in the best
interests of the news, Gregory
inferred.

Gregory, who will be in
Washington, D.C. Friday to
testify before the committee,
continued to infer that the CIA
and the FBI arranged both
assassinations.

“We got a trick for them
come Friday. We’ll show them
documents and say ‘here are 80
percent of the folks who killed
King: retired and off-duty FBI
agents, and we dare you to deny
it cause we got documented
truth,”’Gregory said. _

He cited the coincidental
deaths of six former FBI agents
involved in the Kennedy éin-
vestigations. All were sub-
poenaed to testify before the
committee and all were killed
before they could testify, he
said.

A vegetarian and interested
in health himself, Gregory told
the audience that many of the
preservatives in today’s foods
were developed by the Nazis
and fed to Jews in concentration
camps.

you night notice the word
“artificial’’ near the bottom of
the label—that cancels out the
words ‘strawberry preser-
ves’,’’ he continued.

Gregory noted that artificial
strawberry preserves include a
derivative from anti-freeze.
“That explains why antifreeze
costs so much during. the
winter,’’ he said, ‘‘you eat it all
summer.’

He also said that immitation

vanilla extract includes the
waste from the product tur-

contains as ingredients words

reviews it has been receiving
does full justice to the power of
their live performances. Com-
parisons with the Nighthawks,
another East Coasty-based
blues band, are inevitable and,
in many cases, unfair to the
Allstars, but one thing the two
bands do seem to share is the
classic problem of a great con-
cert band unable to duplicate its
live sound on vinyl.

Lucille Schoettle’s vocals in
particular (no to mention her
sensuous presence, one of the
band’s focal points on stage)
seem to lose much of their
power and clarity in the
cramped confines of the recor-
ding studio.

Mark Mainwaring and I were

like “Forty Days and Forty

like “The Fever’, displaying

So if you like what you’ve
been hearing, (and their album
is excellent — despite my niggl-
ing criticisms it shows an in-
credible amount of promise)
get a jump on the rest of the
world and see the Allstars in the

Council members, IFC talk noise

(continued from page 1)
the fraternity members.

“Not all of this is coming
down on you just because of of
music,”’ Councilman Larry
Mann explained. He said that
people leaving the parties
sometimes make noise that
results in a complaint being
registered. He suggested that
fraternity members ‘get to
know”’ the people living around
the fraternity house to establish
better community relations.

Andy Fitzgerald, president of
Phi Kappa Psi, suggested that
the police forward noise com-
plaints against fraternities to
the IFC and let ‘‘peer pressure”’
control the noise problem.
Specific names of the complain-
tants would not be disclosed,

just the house against which the
complaint was registered. The
IFC would then impose punish-
ment upon the fraternity in
violation.

Imeson called Fitzgerald’s
Suggestion ‘‘very construc-
tive,’ but told the fraternity
representatives that they could
not expect the City Council to
change the ordinance.

“Any change we make in the
noise ordinance has to be looked
at in terms of how it will affect
the other citizens in the com-
munity (who also violate the
noise statute) ,’’ he said.

‘‘What I’m offering you is not
what you have asked © for
(changes in the ordinance),”’
Imeson told the fraternity

He said that an improvement
in the general appearance of

adherence of the noise laws
would “‘probably”’ result in less

Warner Wins Election

Republican John Warner
defeated Democrat Andrew
Miller by 3,268 votes in Tues-
day’s election for Virginia’s
Senate seat in one of the closest
elections in the state’s history.

Warner's winning margin
was by just over two-tenths of
one percent of the total vote ina
race that was ‘‘too close to call”
for most of the evening and was
not decided until all of the
state’s 1,861 precincts had
reported in by 12:30 a.m.

Warner polled 611,725 votes
state-wide, or 50.13 percent of
the votes cast. Miller received
608,457 votes, or 49.87 percent.

The vote was tabulated by the
News Election Service (the two
wire services and the three na-
tional networks) and is not of-
ficial.

As of publication, Miller had
not yet conceded the election or
called for a recount.

Under Virginia law, the
Democratic candidate can ask
for an official audit of the elec-
tion because the vote difference
was one percent or less.

Mass confusion seemed to sur-
round the top floor of Reid Hall
Tuesday night. ‘

The reason for the apparent
madness was, of course, the
election and its coverage by
Cable Nine TV and WLUR-FM,
Washington and Lee’s student
operated television and radio
stations.

Throughout the building
phones rang, AP machines
clicked, information was taken,
computed, typed or scribbled,
and sent off with runners who
sprinted to the studio. For-
tunately, no one was hurt in the
crowded halls that resembled
Zollman’s during a grain party.

Although the event seemed
confusing and disorganized, it
was really prepared and ran
quite effectively under election
night pressure.

Several people copied and
computed returns for
redistribution while tapes of
conversations and results were
made in a studio. Returns were
posted and recordings played to

help newscasters keep viewers
up to date on the local and na-
tional election results.

Charlie Smith, who was in
charge of the coverage, looked
disheveled but seemed pleased
as the night wore on. Smith
noted that information did not
always come in fast enough and
said, ‘‘nothing is more difficult
than speaking into a camera
with no information in front of
you.”

Smith did a good job of cover-
ing up the few dry spells in

returns that occurred
periodically throughout the
night.

Information was not only col-
lected from the wire services,
but reporters from Richmond
and other election headquarters
called in with returns.

Cable Nine reporters remain-
ed in constant contact with
television station WDBJ and
radio stations in Roanoke, Rad-
ford, and Charlottesville.

sources to provide viewers with

Four Fraternities

Fail Inspections

by David Greer

Four fraternities were placed
on social probation for failing to
meet house maintenance re-
quirements, Interfraternity
Council president Jim Davis
said yesterday.

Pi Kappa Alpha, Phi Kappa
Sigma, and Beta Theta Pi were
placed on two weeks social pro-
bation. Sigma Alpha Epsilon
was placed on one week social
probation.

Each fraternity was given a
checklist to determine the con-
dition of the chapter house and
note necessary repairs on the
structure.

Each fraternity had to meet
the requirements on _ the
checklist and turn it in. Last
week, members of the Fraterni-
ty Inspection Committee in-
spected the houses to see_if they
had conformed to the list.

The four fraternities failing to
meet the standards on the

checklists were referred to the
Student Affairs Committee,
who decided the punishments.

According to Assistant Dean
of Students Dan Murphy, the
fraternities placed on social
probation had misrepresented
themselves on the lists.

The Fraternity Inspection
Committee is a six-member
body made up of students,
faculty, and administrators.
This is the first inspection the
committee has made this year;
one inspection was made last
spring. The inspections were
announced.

Fraternities on social proba-
tion are not allowed to have par-
ties or female guests in the
chapter house. No more than
five members of a fraternity on
probation can be seen together,
except during normal functions
at the house (such as meals or
meetings).

E.G, Gives. $100 to
Independents’ Union

by Randy Smith

The Executive Committee
gave the recently formed
Washington and Lee _ In-
dependents’ Union $100 at Mon-
day night’s E.C. meeting.

John Schmidt, organizer of
the group, had asked the E.C.
for a $100 loan to pay for ‘‘office
expenses” and “‘publicity’’ to
stir interest in the new
organization.

The Independents’ Union will
attempt to coordinate in-

tramural sports and social ac-
tivities for non-fraternity
students at W&L. .

Schmidt said that he had
‘about 50” students interested
in the Union, and he has weekly
meetings already planned.

The E.C. was unanimous in
granting the Independents’
Union $100 ‘‘to start out.”

In other. action, the E.C.
decided to hold a mandatory
meeting for the freshman class

Pres. Huntley Speaks to Parents

in Defense of a Liberal Arts E

On Saturday, November 4, W&L President
Robert E.R. Huntley delivered a series of
remarks to several hundred parents and
students entitled In Defense of Liberal Arts

Education.

The enthusiastically received address was also
delivered, in somewhat larger form, to the
Robert E. Lee Associates in New York City one

week before.

Huntley, having completed his first decade in
the office of university president, is well known
as a proponent of the “‘liberally educated mind.”
The Ring-tum Phi is grateful for the opportunity
to review some of his remarks.

The word ‘‘liberal”’ is used in
so many contexts with so many
differing connotations that we
may forget that its primary
meaning has to do with
freedom: liberty and liberation.
A liberal education is an educa-
tion designed to liberate the
mind, to free it from ignorance
and from the animal emotions
and instincts which may con-
strict and dominate it, and to
free it from the aimless and
useless thrashings-about to
which the untutored intellect is
prone.

A liberal education is intend-
ed to cause the mind to become
as useful as it is capable of be-
ing. In this sense, the purpose of
a liberal education is the most
utilitarian of all.

Let me mention a few of my
ideas about the way in which a
liberal arts college like
Washington and Lee attempts
— or should attempt — to pro-
vide its students the foundation
of a liberal education, to help its
students develop useful minds.

The curriculum should _in-
clude courses in all or nearly all
the subjects which time has pro-
ven to be fit for disciplined and
orderly inquiry and which

reveal and explore important
segments of mankind’s ac-
cumulated experience. It’s easy
to discern certain subjects
which must be included —
history and literature, for ex-
ample. Others come quickly to
mind; the natural sciences,
philosophy, religion,
economics, for example.

All these subjects, and some
others, readily meet the two
basic criteria I suggested
earlier. Each is a fit subject for
orderly and disciplined inquiry.
Each encompasses a massive
accumulation of thought and
knowledge and wisdom of
mankind over an _ extended
time. Each has been the subject
of orderly and disciplined ex-
ploration by the best minds of
the past. Thus, each can be

taught and learned in a
manageable way.
The courses, properly

selected and properly taught,
must be imbedded in a cur-
ricular structure which is well
ordered and purposeful. A ran-
dom array will not do. The
undergraduate student must be
guided into this curriculum in a
way which will cause him to
achieve two immediate objec-

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

tives. First, he must have a
significant learning experience
in each of the several kinds of
subjects which make up a

liberal arts curriculum —
humanities, natural sciences,
languages, social sciences.
Furthermore, the student is
required to achieve approx-
imate mastery of at least one
liberal arts subject. He may

The ideal of the liberal arts
tradition is not easily attained,
even by those institutions such
as Washington and Lee which
strive purposefully to attain it.
At best, there must be com-
promises and experiments
which changing times seem to
require. But if the ideal is kept
intact, and clearly agreed upon
by those at the college, the way

preparation. And with prepara-
tion as our objective, it is more
likely that we practical
American will want to know:
Preparation for what? — for
what specific tasks?

Thus, for example, it is com-
monly assumed that one who
spends much time in college on,
say, history or English must be
preparing himself to teach
those subjects. Others — that is,
those who don’t plan to teach
them — must defend the ap-
parent impracticality of their
serious study of the humanities.

Education has been confused
with training. A bird dog needs
training, and if he is to be a good
bird dog, he must have training.
A human being needs educa-
tion, and if he is to be a good
human being, he must have
education. Human beings may
also be trained — whether or
not they are educated. But for
an important task, any in-
telligent employer except a
despot will always choose an

 

“For an important task, any intelligent employers except
a despot will always choose an untrained well-educated

person over an uneducated well-trained one. For human

beings, training is important; education is vital.”

‘or physics, or English, for ex-

ample.

Note that this process, the
liberal arts process, is not the
same as what is sometimes call-
ed ‘‘general  education.’’
‘General education,” if I
understand that term, seeks to
tell the student a little bit about
a lot of things — to produce a

well-informed and presumably |
well-adjusted human being. A -

liberal arts education
postulates that the student
should have the real experience
of learning and thinking in each
of several arenas of knowledge
where the greatest minds of the
past have plowed fertile ground
— and that in one of them he
should become, as nearly as he
can, an expert. Its purpose is
not to produce well-informed
graduates, though it may in-
cidentally do that. Its purpose is
to produce well-educated
graduates, who can quickly
become well informed in almost
any field, and who can apply a
tough and discriminating in-
tellect to the information they
obtain.

can be found to achieve for a
preponderance of the graduates
the foundations of a_ useful
mind.

But make no mistake. The
liberal arts educational pro-
cess, and the liberal educa-
tional ideal, are under attack in
a number of ways, both prac-
tical and philosophical.

I am encouraged to some
degree by the increasing
number of speeches and ar-
ticles defending the liberal arts
tradition in education. I am
distressed that there is a need
for a defense. (Someone once
said that a person who must ask
the purpose of a liberal educa-
tion would be incapable of
understanding the answer. )

In part, the need for such a
defense grows out of the univer-
sality of educational opportuni-
ty, which to our credit we as a
nation have come very close to
achieving. But in our quest for
universality we may have tacit-
ly redefined education to mean

untrained well-educated person
over an uneducated well-
trained one. For human beings,
training is important; educa-
tion is vital.

Professional medical educa-
tion has, in my opinion, become
in recent years a prime exam-
ple of destructive pressure on
the liberal arts and on liberal
education. Medical educators
frequently state their belief in
the need for liberally educated
physicans, but the actions of
their schools often belie their
words.

No one expects that medical
schools will be able to provide
their students with a liberal
education. They are primarily
complex — and effective —
training institutions. If the
medical student or the physi-
cian is to become an educated
person, the foundations for that
prospect will almost certainly
have to come from his college
years. Probably few wound

"A Doll’s House”

by R.B. Ramirez
“There are people one loves,
and others one likes to talk to.”

When one confuses these two -

types of people, it leads to many
difficulties.

These difficulties, and others,
will be explored in Ibsen’s A
Doll’s House, opening next
week in the Boiler Room
Theatre. Al Gordon, the direc-
tor, has promised to produce
the show in all its original Vic-
torian splendor, but in spite of
this all, it will be difficult to im-
agine it as anything but a very
modern play.

It’s hard to think of it as
anything else, though it will see
its 100th birthday next year. It
was, of course, a scandal in its
own time. In Germany, for in-
stance, the script had to be
modified before the show could
go onstage: In Norway this
woman might be able to get
away with such impiety as
walking out on her husband and
children, but let’s not let it be
said that it could happen in Ger-
many!

In our town time, we’ve seen
many stage productions, some
of note, others not, and just in
the last few years there were
two film versions. Doll’s House
has been more or less seized
upon as an _ expression of
feminist sympathy, sort of an
archetypal Joanie Caucus, I
guess, to mention Garry
Trudeau’s affectionate _ por-
trayal of all that’s right with
feminism. Well, I’m as much a
Doonesbury fan as say, Bill
Buckley, but that won't
dissuade me from warning
against the trap of interpreting
art out of chronological con-
text: Ms. Caucus isn’t Nora,
and Ibsen isn’t preaching at us;
all he does really, is present a
difficult problem, very nicely
wrought, for us to argue out
among (or else by) ourselves on
the way home from the theatre.

It’s no accident that the play
ends, rather than begins, in
media res. No, here the issue of
sexual confrontation is not
nearly so important as_ the
dramatic opportunity it pro-
vides. This play is, as Gordon
likes to point out, a happy

drama: a woman leaves much

principal images of the play are
those of debt and the mas-

thunders against debt, not
knowing that the spendthrift
Nora is concealing a loan from
him. Nora is all to ready to con-
sume today and to let her liabili-
ty wait until later. Torvald
hypocritically condemns debt,
but fails to see the debt which he
is bearing: years of blindness
and stupid insensitivity have
accumulated till Nora breaks

Musical Mainstieam

by Mark Mainwaring and Robin Meredith

It’s probably happened to
most rock’n roll fans at one
time or another. You begin
listening toa band when it’s still
virtually unknown. You stand
silent while your friends laugh
when you tell them how good
the group is, and finally watch
almost in disbelief as your band
actually MAKES IT BIG.

That’s how it is with me and
Styx. I wasn’t a fan of theirs
from the very beginning; sur-
prisingly, they’ve been around
in one form or another since
1964, when I was all of six years
old. Dennis De Young joined up
with twin brothers John and
Chuck Panozzo, initially going
under the name of TW4. By
1978, they had added guitarists
John Curulewski and James
Young and began playing local
high schools and colleges as The
Tradewinds.

Finally, in 1970, the band
landed a recording contract
with RCA subsidiary Wooden
Nickel Records and decided to
go under the name Styx. Says
guitarist Young, “It was the on-
ly one none of us hated.”

Even the most loyal Styx fan
would have to admit that the
group’s Wooden Nickel releases
were for the most part dreadful
— poorly conceived and
miserably produced. The one
exception was Styx II, released
in 1972. The single taken from
that particular record, ‘‘Lady,”’
went nowhere at the time.

Something very odd began to
happen, though. People started
calling radio stations after see-

ing Styx in concert (at this point
the band was playing almost ex-
clusively in the Chicago area)
and requesting ‘“‘Lady.”’ This
went on for an incredible 18
months, and Styx finally got
that mythical ‘“‘big break’’ you
always read about.

Dennis De Young tells the
story. “We went to see the
music director of WLS to help
push our new album, Man of
Miracles there was no thought
of ‘Lady’ whatsoever. In the
middle of our conversation he
asked, ‘Oh, by the way, what
would you say if I told you I was
putting Lady on our playlist?.’’
We took it very calmly — danc-
ed a jig on his desk and dove in-
to the water cooler.”’

‘‘Lady” subsequently became
a hit nationwide, of course, but
inability to capitalize on ;that
success caused Styx to change
labels, from from Woeden
Nickel to A&M. They released

and the receptions which follow

The Swedish Bergman, who is
perhaps the most highly regard-
ed director working in film to-
day, helped to inaugurate in the
late 50’s and early 60’s the
“French New Wave,” a move-
ment whose assumptions
dominate the _ international
movie scene even now. The New
Wave, which corresponds con-
ceptually to the ‘‘modern”’
period in literature and pain-
ting, is characterized by ex-
treme aesthetic self-
consciousness and the posing of
challenges to accepted ideas
about morality, reality, and ar-
tistic coherence.

The cornerstone of New Wave
film-making as Bergman
helped to create it is the
“auteur theory,’’ which posits
the director as the true ‘‘star”’
of the film: it is his creative
energy which makes a movie
worth seeing, in the same way
that it is an author’s artistry
which makes a novel worth
reading. Formerly, viewers
went to a movie in order to see a
particular actor or actress,
rather than to follow the career
of a particular artist-director.

Bergman’s early films, like
The Seventh Seal (1956), con-
cern an agonized metaphysical
search for meaning in life.
Beginning notably with Persona
(1966), Bergman concerned
himself more and more with the
actual business of living. Cries
and Whispers, which belongs to
this second group of films, is a
psychological study of three
sisters: Agnes, who is dying of
cancer; Karin, whose self-
control erupts mid-film in sex-
ual violence; and Maria, who
evades emotion through super-
ficiality and frivolous pleasure.
The Maria character is played
by Liv Ullmann. The stunning
reds of the movie’s setting ex-
ternalize the emotional tur-
bulence which the sisters very
largely repress. Ina frightening
scene at the end of Cries and
Whispers, the corpse-like Agnes
holds the living Maria in an em-
brace which represents with
awesome metaphoric power
Bergman’s preoccupation with
the-intrusion of the past into the
present, the difficulty, for the
living, of escaping the
stranglehold of old memories
and people now dead.

Generals lose 18-17 after
holding 17 point lead

by Bill Whalen

The final score of last Satur-
day’s game _ says that
Washington and Lee lost in
what might have appeared as a
well fought match. Anyone,
however, who saw W&L play
Emory & Henry knows that the
Generals lost in an extremely
disappointing way. The
Generals, who had built a 17-0
lead, managed to play poorly
enough in the second half to lose
18-17.

“It certainly was a very
disappointing game,” said
Coach Gary Fallon, ‘‘but when
you have a young team and a
new coaching staff, this can
happen. We had the momentum
and the lead but they blocked
one of our punts and we fumbled
on their four yard line another
time.”

From the way the. game
started, however, it appeared

- |. as though W&L would win in a
‘ rout. On their first possession,

the Generals moved from their
45 to the Emory & Henry 22,
where Stewart Atkinson fumbl:

touchdown. Lee Minetree
scored on a one yard plunge to
give the Generals a 7-0 lead with
2:49 to play in the first quarter.

In the second quarter, W&L
took over on the E&H 19 when
Syd Farrar’s punt was fumbled
by the Wasp’s returner. The
Generals could only move the
ball to the 8 and they had to set-
tle for a 25 yard field goal by
Randy Austin, which gave the
Generals 4 10-0 lead ith 13:00
left in the™first half. At this
point, W&L was in complete
control. The defense kept E&H
under constant pressure, and
Carl Folcik’s interception and
17 yard return to the Wasp’s 26
set up the General’s final
touchdown. Rich Hachenburg’s
11 yard pass to Farrar stretch-
ed the lead to 17-0.

“The game then turned to

ched 67 yards in 10 plays to cut

small size of the audience will
surely effect an increase in the

delicate nuances of expression

which drama needs. It is hoped,
furthermore, that this improve-
ment will come at the expense
of the uncomfortable
“theatricality” demanded by

Freshman defender Dave Mc-
Collum and sophomore
defender Homer Bliss turned in
outstanding efforts in aiding
sophomore goalie Kevin Carney
to record the victory. Coach
Rolf Piranian was especially
pleased with the way in which
the Generals ‘‘totally
dominated’’ the Marlins,
yielding a mere six shots on
goal while taking twenty-three.

Piranian did not have as
much praise for his charges
after the game at VMI,
however’ as he said that the
Generals ‘‘did not play very
well: VMI dominated the game
throughout.’ He went on to say
that ‘“‘a few defensive errors’’
committed by W&L early in the
first half proved costly. Pira-
nian did have praise for
freshman goalie John Guest,
however, saying he Made
“some beautiful saves, once
stopping a penalty-kick, and
another on a very tough shot.”’

good onstage --,1, saw them in
concert this summer and notic-

their earlier shows, mostly due
to the increased emphasis on

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

ound two:

Calendar problems

By this week, the idea of separate graduation
ceremonies for the law students and the
undergraduates in 1979 has become an accepted fact.
Although no specific date has been set for the Lewis
Hall ceremony, the event will surely precede the June
7 graduation by several days — in order to free the
law graduates for those all-important job offers and
bar review classes. So, with the disputes of the cur-
rent year behind them, the University Council and the
faculty turned this week to a consideration of next
year’s calendar.

Unfortunately, a solution that would both restore
the ‘‘unified graduation” and free the law students
from unnecessary inconvenience remained elusive.
The U.C. debated the matter at some length last
Thursday, and emerged with an alternate
undergraduate calendar that would have made
graduation earlier in 1980. But heavy sacrifices from
the undergraduates were necessary for this — in-
cluding a shortened Christmas vacation and the
transformation of the Washington Holiday into a ‘4
day weekend.”’

Students on this side of Woods Creek may be glad to
know that the U.C.’s ‘‘alternative’’ was rejected by
the faculty last Monday. Instead, the more com-
monplace calendar (drawn up by the faculty E.C.)
was approved. Now all the holidays will retain their
usual length, but graduation will again be late: June
5, 1980.

To make a long story short, it seems we’re once

more ‘“‘between a rock and a hard place.”’ The approv-
ed date of June 5 will again fall after the bar review
classes begin for law graduates. Also, all the other
arguments used this year by the law students for an
early graduation will continue to hold weight. And
although no university official has come right out and
said so, it seems logical to assume that the law and
undergraduate commencement exercises will con-
tinue to be separate in future years.

I still believe that this is an unfortunate situation.
Certainly, there are no villains here; the faculty, in
their concern for the undergraduate calendar and
holidays, clearly chose the lesser of two evils last
Monday. But the growing isolation of the law students
from the student body-at-large remains a serious pro-
blem. Now that the ‘‘graduation battle” has reached a
dead end, one can only hope that other means will be
found to preserve that all-important sense of com-
munity between Lewis Hall and the rest of the cam-
pus.

LETTER TO
THE EDITOR

To the editor of the Ring-tum
Phi:

One’s sympathy for the poor
put-upon fraternities
diminishes spectacularly when
one drives past a fraternity
house and encounters broken
beer bottles in the roadway —
as happened to me last Thurs-
day night on Lee Avenue in
front of the Delt house.

Sincerely,
R.S. Keefe

Saturday. There will be no
cover charge in the Cockpit.

Next Wednesday, at 8, Burr
Datz, Lex Birney, and Ron
Spain will perform a varied
acoustic repertoire. Datz and
Birney will trade hot licks on
some blues numbers, and some
bluegrass numbers, and Spain
will add vocal harmonies and a
searing blues harp. This per-
formance will be free to the
general public.

Journalist
to speak

Harold S. Gulliver, editor of
the Atlanta Constitution, will
speak at Washington and Lee
University Monday, Nov. 13, on
the topic ‘‘Ethics and the Jour-
nalist.”’

The lecture will take place in
Lee Chapel at 8 p.m.

The public is invited to the
lecture, which is sponsored by
Society and the Professions,
Washington and Lee’s program
in applied ethics.

Liberty Hall books listed

The first comprehensive
listing and evaluation of the
books contained in the library of
Liberty Hall Academy almost
200 years ago has been publish-
ed in the new issue of The
Virginia Magazine of History
and Biography, the quarterly
journal of the Virginia
Historical Society.

The article, ‘‘The Library of
Liberty Hall Academy,” is by
Betty Ruth Kondayan, head
reference and public-services
librarian at Washington and
Lee University.

Her research is based on a
recently discovered list of 101
titles in the 18th-century
library.

She notes that more than half

the books remain in the W&L
library’s rare book collections
today. The importance attached
to the library in official Liberty
Hall records indicates that the
early trustees ‘recognized
liberty and a library . . . as in-
separable,” she writes. The
titles themselves reflect ‘‘both
breadth of outlook and
tolerance,’’ she notes.

Huntley: Education is vital

(continued from page 2)
argue with this premise.

But the medical schools are
increasingly squeezing the
undergraduate college in the
direction of diluting seriously
the liberal educational- ex-
perience of the pre-medical stu-
dent. This squeeze apparently
results from the need to screen
the large numbers of applica-
tions for admission to medical
school, an understandable pro-
blem.

Many medical school admis-
sions officers appear to be solv-
ing their problem by laying
primary emphasis on the appli-
cant’s specific achievement in
advanced science courses. The
applicant who has A’s in such
science courses and B’s in, let’s
say, history, English, and
economics will be preferred to
the applicant whose A’s are in
the humanities and whose
science grades are good but not
superlative.

Pre-medical students learn
this simple lesson very quickly
and adjust their course selec-
tion and their study habits ac-
cordingly — to the detriment of
their total educational ex-
perience. And the college itself
must soon react to the pressure,
because if its pre-medical
students do not achieve admis-
sion to medical school the
reputation of the college suffers
in the market-place. It may
react by revising its curriculum
to staisfy the medical school ad-
missions pressure, revisions

which may run counter to the

educational ideals which I have
sketched.

You may ask: Why do the col-
leges permit this unwanted in-
trusion into their domain? The
answer, I am afraid, is not a
happy one. Partly, it is a lack of
conviction. Partly, it is lack of
concern.

It is also possible that many

of our large public institutions
—not all, but many — have long
since lost the battle to preserve
a liberal educational ideal. If
this be true, then the last line of
defense is the independent
liberal arts college, which is not
in a strong position to exert ef-
fective pressure on our educa-
tional system.

The public education system
faces its own problems. In re-
cent years we have all heard
much about the diminishing
college-age population. Most
private institutions — certainly
Washington and Lee — have
long since learned to live, and
indeed desire to live, with stu-
dent populations of stable size.

Most public instituions have
become accustomed to living on
what I would call ‘‘the margin
of growth’’ in the years since
World War II; in those years,
there have been rapid annual
increases in student
enrollments at nearly all public
institutions. At most such in-
Stitutions, increased operating
income is a direct and im-
mediate result of increased stu-

dent body size, but the addi-.

tional costs of enlarged size
tend to lag by several years.

Therefore, even if there are
no permanent unit economies of
scale to be derived from
largeness, there will be an ap-
parent financial health provid-
ed by the margin of growth. As
that growth diminishes or levels
off to zero, the pressure on the
public institution to find
students will become increas-
ingly insistent.

Also as the numbers diminish
and at the same time,
legislators and legislatures

become more and more restric-
tive about their willingness to
keep open the faucet of
unlimited public funds, public
institutions all over the country
are turning to private philan-
thropy. I don’t blame them for
that; I simply cite it as a fact.

I would point out one or two
salient economic points about
that observation. For the public
institution, private philan-
thropy is the icing on the cake.
For us, it is the cake.

There are other threats of this
practical variety. There is
however, one _ philosophical
threat that is perhaps of greater
concern.

I believe there is a growing
doubt among educators and
among the populace of
American about the value of the
kind of education I’ve attemp-
ted to describe. I am no longer
as certain as I would have been
twenty years ago, no longer as
certain as I would like to be,
that most persons in America
agree with my emphais on the
importance of liberal educa-
tion.

I suspect that this grows from
several factors. The increasing
demand for practicality, for im-
mediate applicability of
everything learned, is one.
Another, more disturbing, is the
increasing distrust of reason
and rationality. You can see it
all around you — the turn to the
occult, to the metaphysical; the
eschewing of reason as the
primary basis for human ex-
istence.

To these kinds of criticisms,
education should respond
positively and with conviction.
It is my impression that it has
not yet done so.

At Washington and Lee, I
believe I can speak for the
faculty, the students, and Board
of Trustees in assuring you that
it is our determined intention to
retain our educational ideal. We
will survive as at least one in-
stitution that believes in the
liberal education, #the value of

the human mind, and in the
aspirations of the human spirit.
With continued assistance, this
school, two hundred years from
now, will still represent the
traditions and the strengths
which it has represented for the
two hundred years that have
gone before.

Library ‘Moving Day”
Planned for Jan. 10

40 kegs of beer and two bands

As the fall term nears its
close, work continues to rush on
at a mad pace in McCormick
Library for the move to their
new quarters. The move is
scheduled for January, 1979,
barring any unforeseen delays.

Though a _ strike among
manufacturers of library shelv-
ing threatens total completion
of the interior equipment on the
designated date, plans are still
in full force for the movement of
many library books during the
Christmas break — to be
climaxed by a university ‘‘mov-
ing day’’ on Wednesday, Jan.
10. Under the direction of stu-
dent chairman Steve Mangan, a
committee of students and
faculty has been formed to co-
ordinate the day’s events.

If all goes according to plan,
all furniture, special collec-
tions, and oversized books will

Atlanta Editor

 

be moved to the new facility
before Jan, 10. What will re-
main in McCormick for move-
ment by volunteers, is approx-
imately 40-50% of the regular
stack books.

In a vote of resounding ap-
proval and enthusiasm, the
faculty agreed to cancel class
meetings on Jan. 10 — a
measure unheard of in recent
years — with the understanding
that students will choose to par-
ticipate in the ‘‘moving day.”

Tentative plans call for each
worker — whether student,
faculty member, or town resi-
dent — to make 18 delivery trips
to and from the new library.
The library staff estimates that
this will take approximately six
hours, beginning at 8:30 a.m.
with an hour break for lunch.

The committee stressed,
though, that the day’s events

Speaks on Journalism

by Joe Dashiell

Newspapers will not change
drastically between now and
the year 2000, according to
Harold S. Gulliver, editor of
theAtlanta Constitution..

Gulliver spoke in Lee Chapel
Monday night in the first of a
series of lectures presented by
the ethics program, Society and
the Professions.

Gulliver said he served on a
committee organized to con-
sider the future of newspapers.
He noted that in the last decade,
newspapers have experienced
remarkable technological ad-
vances.

Possible future developments
include a laser system which
can edit type while the
newspaper presses are rolling
and an alternate form of
newsprint produced from a
fibrous plant.

Gulliver, editor of the Atlanta
Constitution since 1975, also
mentioned several areas of con-
cern in the journalism profes-
sion.

The first area, which he term-
ed “the kiss and tell school of
journalism,” involves coverage
of the private lives of public of-
ficials. As an example, Gulliver

can hardly be classified as
“work.’’ The movement of the
books will be the central event,
certainly — but plans are
underway for a veritable circus
of ‘‘side  attractions,’’
guaranteed to make the univer-
sity moving day an affair to
remember.

For te hungry, the day will
begin with hot coffee and
donuts. This will be followed
with a complimentary lunch for
ail workers, courtesy of Jerry
Darrell and Evans Dining Hall.
And to aid the digestive pro-
cess, taped music will play on
campus throughout the day
(how’s that for a first...).

Local and regional TV-radio
stations have been contacted,
and will be present at the move-
ment site. Station officials have
called the plan ‘exciting and in-
novative,”’ and will provide
generous news exposure.

The committee has also made
plans to produce a memorial

“grain cup,” to be given to all

participants. Other incentive

fles for larger prizes are still in

The Executive Committee
began serious discussion of
establishment of a Grade-
Review Board at the E.C.
meeting Monday night.

Bob Willis, sophomore E.C.:

representative and a member
of the subcommittee in-
vestigating the proposal, said a
grade-review committee would
be ‘‘very hard for us to form,”
especially since grades cannot
now be overturned. Under the
present system, the professor
has the final say.

Willis made three recommen-
dations to the E.C. as steps
toward a Grade-Review Board:

—that students have a right to
see anything that is graded
(such as final examinations) ;

E.C. Discusses

—professors should outline in
detail the requirements of the
course and the percentage of
the final grade each test will
represent;

—initiate an ‘‘appeal pro-
cess’’ empowering the heads of
departments and the dean of the
college to overturn a final
grade.

The committee will present
its formal recommendations to
the E.C. at the Nov. 27 meeting.

In other action at Monday’s
E.C. meeting, which was noted
for being one of the briefest on
record, the committee made
tentative plans to cancel next
week’s meeting. The committee
will meet in the event of crisis.

 

The Harris Computer:
versatile but troublesome

Last in a series

by Stuart Snyder

The Harris 125 Computer,
Washington and Lee’s newest
computer, is the most
sophisticated and _ versatile
computer that the university
has ever owned. Yet, it ap-
parently has been the most
troublesome of W&L’s four
computers.

The 125 serves both the
Academic and Administrative
needs of the university at the
same time. According to Dr.
Robert B. Brownell, former
director of the Computer
Center, this was not the case
with the 1130, the old computer.
The Administrative and
Academic uses of the old com-
puter were completely
separated because the 1130
could handle only one problem
ata time.

At first, the Administrative
time alloted for the computer
outnumbered that of the
Academic time, but this

gradually changed, stated
Brownell. Finally, the Ad-
ministrative and Academic
times allowed on the computer
were about even.

However, according to
Brownell, this was not totally
satisfactory, because it was for-
seen that the Academic demand
was going to keep on expanding.
Thus the need for a new com-
puter existed.

According to Brownell, the
new computer had to serve the
students, faculty and ad-
ministrators at the same time,
have security in the system so
that no one could reach the Ad-
ministrative files, and be flexi-
ble in it’s applications.

Dr. Thomas Imeson, director
of the Computer Center adds,
the new computer had to con-
tain a large “‘on line’”” memory
and utilize the most currently
used high level computer
language.

Both agreed that cost com-
patable with the University
played a major role in the selec-
tion of the computer.

The selection committee con-
sisting of: Dr. John A. Wise, the
committee chairman, Dr.
Robert B. Brownell, Dr.
Thomas C, Imeson, Dr. Robert
A. Roberts, and the late Dr. Ed-
ward F. Turner Jr. made their
choice of computer system
from six major companies.
These companies were:
Hewlett Packard, Digital
Equipment Corporation,
I.B.M., Data General, Interdata
and the Harris Corporation.

According to Brownell, Har-
ris was included because a
faculty member knew one of the
operators at a Harris Installa-
tion in Arkansas..

A good part of the decision in
favor of the Harris System was
based on the committee’s im-
pressive two-day encounter

Dartmouth Faculty Moves

to Close Fraternities

Today, it is an accepted fact
that very few universities in
America can boast (or bemoan)
the existence of a_ thriving
fraternity system more than
Washington and Lee. With ap-
proximately 70% of the class of
1982 pledged to fraternities,
W&L remains a citadel of the
Greek system. Even so, the
‘‘orandfather”’ of fraternity col-
leges — where the system is the
strongest and the _ highest
percentage of men belong to
fraternities — has always been
Dartmouth College in New
Hampshire.

Many W&L students have
proudly compared our system
to Dartmouth’s — and with
some justice. As a result, the re-
cent controversy surrounding
this northern bastion of frater-
nity life should hit pretty close
to home on this campus...

HANOVER, N.H. — The
faculty of Dartmouth College
recently voted to close the 20
fraternities on the campus, as a
result of a major anti-fraternity

Library landscaping begins

by Charles Tucker

Anyone who has _ recently
traversed the back-campus
area has undoubtedly noticed
the presence of thousands of
grass-like potted plants
blanketing the area between
Newcomb and Reid Halls. Com-
monly known as ‘monkey
grass,’’ their present location in
front of Reid Hall certainly
brightens the construction-
marred turf in that area. But
the location is only temporary.
The durable monkey grass

represents another in the final ,
stages of the library movement, |

and is to be planted in the mall
surrounding the new structure.
Douglas E. Brady, Jr., pro-
jects manager of Washington &
Lee, said that much of this ex-
terior landscaping will be com-
pleted before the end of interior
construction. Immediate land-
scaping priority is being given
to the most visible areas — the
front mall and the land under
the walkway to the new

building.

This week's warm weather has heldped speed the I

campaign. The school’s
trustees, many of whom are
alumni, will take final action on
the measure in a vote next
February.

The faculty move comes in
the wake of the phenomenal
success of “National Lam-
poon’s Animal House,’’ a com-
edy dealing with a college
dean’s attempt to rid the cam-
pus of a hard-drinking, wild-
living fraternity house. Ac-
cording to Chris Miller, one of
the screenwriter’s for the movie
(and a 1963 Dartmouth
graduate), many of the in-
cidents in “‘Animal House’’ are
based on true events during his
years at Dartmouth.

The displeasure of the, Dart-
mouth faculty was already at a
high point previous to the
movie’s release. Last spring,
about a dozen people were
treated for alcoholic convul-
sions during ‘‘Sink Night,” the
installation ceremony for

tionally the year’s wildest
celebration.

Even though records show
that fraternity men at Dart-
mouth have a higher grade-
point average than the overall
campus population, there have
been repeated charges of ‘‘anti-
intellectualism’’ from the facul-
ty. Professor James Epperson,
leader of the anti-fraternity
drive, accused the houses of
“encouraging alcoholism,
misbehavior and values that
have no place in institutions of
higher learning.”’

No one on the Dartmouth

campus is willing to predict the -

outcome of the conflict, but stu-
dent opposition to the proposi-
tion continues to run very high.
More than half of the school’s
4,000 students belong to fratern-
ties, and two new sorority
houses are under attack as well.
Recent polls by campus
organizations proved the ex-
istence of a strong sentiment

Finally, to celebrate the
library move in grand style, the:
committee has approved plans
for a major party in the vacant
McCormick building Wednes-
day night. The celebration is be-.
ing co-ordinated by Burr Datz,
and will feature the music of.

The party will be open to all
workers during the day, and
their dates.

Final information on what
may well be the most unique

event of the year will be
reported in the Ring-tum Phi as
plans are set. The present plan
calls for a volunteer force of
900-1000 to participate; students
and faculty should compose the
bulk of this number, but_in-
volvement from townspeople
and other campuses is en-
couraged. Music, food, televi-
sion cameras, the faculty in
their shirt-sleeves, a party at
the end, and a chance to per-
form an invaluable service to
the library we've all been
waiting years to see finish-
ed...Such a combination is not
likely to be repeated anytime
soon — so gear up for a one-of-a-
kind experience next Jan. 10.

 

 

Former Sen. James L.
Buckley will speak at
Washington and Lee on Dec. 6 in
Lee Chapel.

Buckley was the Conser-
vative Party Senator from New
York from 197] to 1976, when he
was defeated for reelection by
Daniel P. Moynihan (D-NY).

Perhaps one of Buckley’s best
known achievements as Senator
was The Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act of 1974,
often referred to as_ the
“Buckley Amendment.”’

The Buckley Amendment
allows a student to examine his
permanent record maintained
by educational institutions to
assure the accuracy of its con-

tents.

Presently, Buckley is serving
as director of the investment
banking firm of Donaldson,
Lufkin, and Jenrette.

He is also the vice-chairman
of the Republican National
Committee’s Advisory Council
on General Government and is
Chairman of the Subcommittee
on the Rediscovery of
Federalism.

Sen. Buckley is the brother of
the well-known writer and syn-
dicated columnist William F.
Buckley.

The lecture is being jointly
funded by the Mock Convention
and Contact Committees.

Convention:

One recurrent question that
people raise concerning the
Mock Convention is what exact-
ly does a state chairman do?
This is a difficult question to
answer because the chairman
of a delegation is pretty much
responsible for everything that
concerns his state. These
responsibilities can cut across a
rather broad spectrum _in-
cluding the obvious area of
political research but also fund
raising, building a float, and
even publicity.

As soon as the chairmen are
announced in the winter term
their first task will be to recruit
officers to work within their
delegation. These will include a
treasurer, secretary and any
other positions to carry out the
necessary administrative func-
tions. Next a delegation must be
recruited. The number of this
group depends upon the size of
the delegation at the real con-
vention. Although most people
would prefer to work for their
home state, considering the
number of students from
Virginia at W&L compared to
the numbers neded to fill the
California delegation, one
quickly sees that it is not very
practical to assign students
always according’ to
preference. Despite a rather
diverse student body there

WL
IU

1980

aren’t too many people here
from Nevada, Alaska, or Guam.

Once the delegations are fill-
ed (hopefully by the beginning
of next year) the state chair-
man is responsible for raising
money from corporations,
parents and alumni within his
state. At the same time he must
oversee the research being done
and begin planning for the
parade.

A good deal of leadership is
required to recruit and run a
state delegation. In the end,
however, it is one of the most
rewarding jobs in the Mock
Convention. If you are consider-
ing it, stop by the Mock Conven-
tion office in room 205 of the
University Center.

Troubled Computer System

The major problem with the
125 is it’s large number of unex-
pected ‘‘down”’ sessions, where
the computer goes out of ser-
vice. A good bit of these
“downs” can be attributed to
known causes, but according to
Imeson neither he nor the Har-
ris Corporation know what the

majority of the problems stem
from.

Dr. Robert L. Wilson, Pro-
fessor of Mathematics, who
teaches computer science,
points out that even the fastest

computer in the world goes
down once every seven hours,
but in those seven hours it can
accomplish what an average
computer would take weeks to
do.

Similarly, if the 1130 were to
break down once a year that
would be comparable to the 125
breaking down once a month,
explains Wilson.

The unexpected ‘‘downs’’ are
caused by uneven flow of elec-
tricity from VEPCO and other
sources attributed to internal
difficulties stemming from
mismanagement by the Harris
Corporation and W&L’s
operators.

The Harris Croporation and
W&L have done several things
to correct this problem:

First, Harris has_ sent
representatives to W&L to

The Ring-tum Phi, Nov. 16, 1978, Page 3

thoroughly inspect the com-
puter. The results have yet to be
made public.

Second, Imeson has turned
back the baud of the computer,
which should not affect the pro-
cessing time of the computer.
Baud is the number of
characters of information pro-
cessed per second.

Other set backs and problems
associated with the 125 are:
dependence on the 1130, over-
crowding of the terminals, and
game users monopolizing the
terminals.

The dependence on the 1130 is
only temporary and is only
limited to Administrative work,
states Mr. O. Lee Dudley,
Director of Data Processing
and Administrative Work.

According to Imeson, the
complete transfer from the 1130
to the 125 will be finished by
next summer.

Originally, the transfer was
to have been completed by the
first of 1979.

In the mean time there exists
a dual system which is very dif-
ficult to operate under, says
Dudley. Converting the pro-
grams is slow work, he adds.

Overcrowding of the ter-
minals is still a problem. But,
hopefully the planned cluster of
terminals in Parmly Hall will
help to alleviate the problem.

There should be no problem

. with game users tying-up ter-

minals in the future. The once
unwritten rules concerning the
rights of computer users is now
posted on the wall in the Com-
puter Center. It states that
game participants must yield to
legitimate student and faculty
use of the computer.

Even so, only time will tell
whether the situation with the
Harris 125 will ever be cleared

up.

 

Gulliver speech

(continued from page 1)
questioned whether Joan Ken-
nedy’s arrest two years ago on
charges of drunk driving truly
constituted a front page story.

Gulliver also criticized the
performance of the media in in-
forming the public of important
issues. He noted that Richard
Nixon was reelected President
months after the burglary at the
Watergate complex.

He also charged that the news
media wrote off the Carter cam-
paign in 1975.

The Atlanta editor voiced con-
cern about the ‘‘overall climate
that affects both the media and
newspapers.’’ He said many
young journalists today believe
“every story is going to be
Watergate.” >

The conflict between the First
Amendment right of free press,
and the Sixth Améndment right
of fair trial also is an area. of
concern, according to Gulliver.

The old IBM 1130 computer. Information in the 1130 is now being transferred to the Harris 125. The

transfer will be finished by summer,

He said that the Supreme
Court’s opinion on the conflict is
typified by Justice Byron
White’s statement that it is
more important to do
something a about crime, than
to write about it.

Gulliver also mentioned that
the number of independent
newspapers in the United States
is quickly decreasing.

He said that there is much to
be said for both local and chain
ownership of newspapers, but
the question of which system is
better ‘finally gets back down
to the people who run them and
what kind of ethics they have.”

Gulliver, a 1957 graduate of
Yale University, joined the staff
of the Atlanta Constitution in
1962 as a reporter, and was ap-
pointed editor in 1975. He has
co-authored a book on George
Wallace, and is presently work-
ing on one about Jimmy Carter.

Al Gordon’s production of
Henrik Ibsen’s A Doll’s House,
running in the Boiler Room
Theatre this week, is the first
show in the University
Theatre’s shortened ‘regular
season.’’ Though Gordon’s is
not an experienced studio pro-
duction, he hardly picked a safe
play with A Doll’s House.

Ibsen’s script is one full of pit-
falls, into some of which I’m
afraid Gordon and his cast have
fallen. Especially in these days
when Ibsen is hailed by many as
a glorious precursor of today’s
feminist movement, there is a
great temptation to read this
play as a veritable ‘“‘woman’s
lib manifesto.”

The danger with staging such
a ‘“‘manifesto’’ is the temptation
to play it too broadly. This
tendency, along with the cast’s
overco ensatio for an embarass-
ingly small audience (even by
W&L standards), served to
make Act I of A Doll’s House a
less than agreeable experience.

Anne Secor’s Nora seemed to
have a vocal range of shrill to
shrill, and modulations of ex-
pression to match. It was dif-
ficult to imagine that her
thoughless Nora, trampling on
Cristine’s (Rose Gordon) feel-
ings at every turn, was also the
same Nora we learn has been
managing to repay a Shylock
for eight long years on a
shoestring budget. Too much
energy at times kills the reflec-
tion we are told must exist
there. ’

Hunt Brown’s’ Torvald
Helmer poses a similar pro-
blem in the first act. Playing too
broadly at times, Brown falls
prey to the temptation to have
“fun” with lines which beckon
to be trifled with, but which
shouldn’t be. Brown’s relish of
these early scenes leads to no
impression that Torvald actual-
ly enjoys tormenting Nora (his
wife), rather than playing at

OF

 

wi

playing with her. Brown’s Tor-
vald is not the aloof, precise
character that Ibsen wrote.

A part of Brown’s problems
are due to casting. The expan-
siv: qualities he has at his com-

mand do not mesh well with the
fastidious and distanced Tor-
vald.

Dona Flor; an autumn gem

 

by Dick Barron

It’s that time of year again —
the big flood of Hollywood
movies that thrilled you all
summer and in the early fall
has finally dried up. You've
seen Grease eighteen times and
you’ve committed Animal
House to memory. The tattered
remains ofStar Wars and Satur-
day Night Fever have been pull-
ed from the screen and Sgt.
Pepper’s has been put to rest.

So what’s left for America’s
hungry moviegoers (especially
if they’re in Lexington)? Well,
never fear, Dona Flor’s here.
Dona Flor and Her Two
‘Husbands, that is.

Dona Flor and Her Two
Husbands catches the viewer
off guard and keeps him there.
The film opens with a scene of
several men sitting around a
table drinking, singing, and
wearing dresses — everything’s
okay, however, because it’s
canival time. The gang mar-
ches around, singing and
laughing merrily, but suddenly
the merriest one of the bunch
drops dead — stone cold. He
turns out to be the late husband
of Dona Flor. Dona Flor spends
her mourning period
remembering her beloved
Vadhino in a lengthy flashback
sequence. Theirs was an un-
iortunate marriage — Vadhino
went oul gambling to leave
Dona Flor at héme with her
cooking. Vadhino satisifed her
desires, but did little else for
her...

After Vadhino’s death, Dona
Flor marries the local druggist,
a portly man with a “‘passion
for classical music.’’ He leaves
all his passion with the oboe and
leaves Dona Flor physically un-
satisfied. He gives here the
security that the first husband
failed to give, but without the
fireworks of the first marriage.
As they say — “you can’t
always get what you want.”’

That’s a very brief summary
of this long, complex story. One
could detail the plot twists for
the next few pages, but in the in-

' terest of intelligence that one’ll

be brief. What’s impressive

air comes a crisp, well-acted
Act IT. In the second act, and in-
deed for the rest of the play, the
pieces come together. Miss
Secor finally discovers another

about this film is the way in
which a ponderous story is.so ef-
fectively presented by director
Bruno Barreto. This kind of
story has so many potentially
dangerous areas for a director
that for Barreto to have even
made the film coherent is quite
an accomplishment. Visually
the film has a certain feeling of
realism which is rarely seen in
recent movies. A large number
of the scenes are shot with
natural light in obviously real
surroundings. There are very
few sets.

But that’s not enough. Any
grade “B’ movie can be
realistic. No, what makes Dona
Flor a grade ‘‘A”’ movie is the

cartoon character — but is a co
lex, thinking woman (the
woman she is meant to be even
in ActI).

In the second act, Brown also
seems to get Torvald under con-
trol. Torvald becomes patroniz-
ing but detached from’ Nora.
Brown finally makes his Tor-
vald “‘play”’ without putting too
much of himself in to the game.

Among the supporting roles,
Fred Nethery brings a real
surety to his portrayal of Dr.
Rank. Particularly praise wor-
thy is Rank’s momentary lapse
when he thinks he has offended
Nora with his declaration of
secret love for her.

Rose Gordon as Cristine
Linde turned in a superb per-
formance. Her sensitivity
throughout the play, refreshing-
ly incongruous in the first act, is
a delight to watch. It is good to
watch Mrs. Gordon stretch her
“dramatic legs’’ after her last
two, rather burlesque parts.

Except for occassionally
sticking his nose a bit too high in
the air, David Jefferson Sor-
rells plays a convincingly jaded
Nils Krogstad. He successfully
avoid crossing the fine line
which separates his role from
the land of Snidely Whiplash
and melodramatic villains.

Pree Ray and Virginia Dutton
as Anna, the nurse, and Helen
the maid, in the tradition of all
well-played domestics, do what
they’re supposed to do.

The play is staged on Tom
Zigler’s well-conceived set, in
the round. The audience seems
to find itself seated on the
periphery of the Helmers’ living
room. This intimacy makes the
loud first act look excessive but
allows the audience to full ap-
preciate the fine acting leeks in
the play.

Act III is dominated by Secor
and Brown’s fine (and unex-
pected) playing of the climax.
Torvald’s blow up contrasts
very well with his ‘‘reconcilia-
tion’’ with Nora. In the end, a
real dramatic achievement is
gained by the final curtain.

Ducks Deluxe
Don’t Mind Rockin’ Tonite
RCA-AFLI-3025

Ducks Deluxe was formed in
1972 out of the Brinsley
Schwarz/Dave Edmunds axis
which was_ currently
dominating the pub scene in and
around London. They released
two albums and several singles
on British RCA before their
break-up in the summer of 1975.

For the last three years the
Ducks have been a ghost band,
mentioned often in the context
of the surging commercial suc-
cess of friends Dave Edmunds
and Graham Parker, but vir-
tually unheard of due to the fact
that both of their albums have
been long out-of-print.

This set the stage for Don’t
Mind Rockin’ Tonite, a
generous (seven songs per side)
collection of the band’s best
work. The liner notes’ claims
that the Ducks ‘“‘helped mould
the future history of rock ’n’
roll” are somewhat exag-
gerated, but the fact remains
that without the pioneering
work of such forgotten heroes
as Ducks Deluxe and Brinsley
Schwarz the names_ Elvis
Costello and Nick Lowe would
hardly be the household words
they are today.

As for the music itself, there
is something for everybody and
more on Don’t Mind Rockin’...
The band moves with ease from
melodic, Beatles-esque songs
like ‘‘Love’s Melody’ to
delightful cover versions of
“It’s All Over Now,” “I Fought
the Law,’’ and ‘“‘Here Comes the
Night.”

Most importantly, the album

and Robin Meredith

has a cohesive feel to it which is
relatively uncommon among
anthologies — rather than jerk-
ing from one high point to
another, it flows with a very at-
tractive sense of consistency.
Just a sideline; the Ducks
may not have had any direct in-
fluence on the future of rock ’n’
roll, but they do provide an in-
teresting basis for speculation
on the future of such American
“Blue Wave’’ bands as _ the
Allstars and the Nighthawks.
Their current status is much
the same as the Ducks’ was six
years ago. It will be interesting
to see if history repeats itself
and the blues become a major
force in the mainstream of
American popular music as a
result of the dues paid by these
local heroes.

along came such writer! as
Burroughs and Lovecraft with
their offspring of fantasy and
horror. ‘“‘Hard-science”’ authors
added space ships complete
with blue prints, robots and in-
terstellar wars.

Then a fantastic thing hap-
pened on the way back and forth
to outer space: Science began to
catch up with science fiction.
The Golden Age stories of the
1930’s and 1940’s began to ap-
pear as truth in the newspapers.
So sometimes today it is hard to
tell the far-seeing scientists
from the old-time science fic-
tion writers. During the last
couple of decades two sub-
species of SF have burgeoned.
Psychological, ecological, uto-
pian stories with a special angle
of vision or point of view are a
strong force in this “new
wave.” It is often experimental
in form and language.

Fantasy is the other flowering
of today’s SF. J.R.R. Tolkien is
the Superman of fantasy, of
course. (The Hobbit is the all-
time bestseller in the
Bookstore.) There are many
others, however, such as C.S.
Lewis, Anne McCaffery,
William Morris and Ellison.

_ Literary critics are now pay-
ing attention to SF as a serious
branch of literature. Le Guin’s
Farthest Shore won the Na-
tional Book Award in 1973, for
instance. No longer a step-child
in the literary world, much
science fiction writing is now
recognized as fine use of
language.

Science fiction is big business
as well as big literature
nowadays. About 15% of all fic-
tion published today falls under
the expansive canopy of SF.
This makes the selection of
new, high quality books increas-
ingly hard. The Bookstore’s
science fiction shelves are four
times as large as they were six

years ago and still they come.

Here’s a short list of some of
the recent arrivals in the
Bookstore along with some of
the all-time greats. Happy
escape to you:
The Time Machine, Wells
The Star Maker, Stapledon
The Dispossessed, Le Guin
Canticle for Leibowitz, Miller
That Hideous Strength, Lewis
A Whiff Of Death, Asimov
Lord Foul’s Bane, Donaldson
Lucifer’s Hammer, Niven*
Gateway, Pohl
Splinter of the Mind’s Eye,

Water Polo season

ends at 15-9

by Sam Campbell

The water polo Generals
finished their season last
weekend at the Eastern Inter-
collegiate Water Polo Cham-
pionships at Brown University.
W&L lost to host Brown, Ohio
State, and M.I.T. for an eighth-
place finish. Keith Romich,
Drew Pillsbury, and Bob
Newcomb each had a goal in the
first game, which Brown won
16-3. In all likelihood, Brown
will be picked to represent the
East in the Nationals on the
strength of their play last
weekend.

In Ohio State’s 14-10 win,
Romich had _ six goals,
Newcomb two, and Pillsbury
and Biff Martin one each. Ohio
State seemed to have the edge
on the Generals chiefly because
they had more experienced
players. Romich had four goals
and Biff Martin made a penalty
shot in the 10-5 loss to MIT.

Coach Bill Stearns looked
upon the trip as a “‘learning ex-
perience,’ but he also
lamented, ‘‘we don’t like to lose
while we’re learning.’’ He ex-
plained that the teams the
Generals regularly play are

simply not of the same calibre
as the teams they faced last
weekend. ‘‘And the only way
we'll be able to improve our
standing,” he pointed out, ‘‘is to
play these teams regularly.”
Stearns spoke of tentative plans
to take a team out to California

late this summer to play some
of the best teams in the country,
and possibly adding some Ivy
League schools to the schedule
next year, but he cited the lack
of money as the greatest hin-
drance to this plan.

Overall, Stearns said he was
very pleased with the play of
the inexperienced team
throughout the season, and
praised Keith Romich for his
fine job in the Easterns, as well
as the other games. The
Generals finished the season
with a 15-9 record against the
best competition in the eastern

United States. Looking forward
to next year, Stearns hopes the
Generals will be able to ac-

complish in one goal that which —

eluded them this season: a win
over Richmond. Romich led the
team in scoring with 78 goals,
while Martin had 74.

Generals comeback fails at
end - lose to GU 25-24.

by Bill Whalen

What does it take to win a
football game? The Washington
and Lee Generals must be
thinking this after losing to the
highly ranked Georgetown
Hoyas on a field goal with eight
seconds left. Last Saturday, the
Generals, who at one point trail-
ed 24-3, came back to lead 25-24
before Jim Corcoran’s 20 yard
field goal ended the game at
27-25. The loss gave Coach Gary
Fallon’s first W&L team a final
record of 2-8.

“TI was very disappointed with
the outcome because we had
played so well to that point,”

said Fallon. “I am also very
disappointed with the  of-
ficiating; it left a lot to be
desired.’’ What particularly
upset Fallon was a controver-
sial call in Georgetown’s last
drive, which could have cost
W&L the win. On fourth and
three from deep in Hoya ter-
ritory, punter Mike Foster fak-
ed a kick and threw a five yard
pass for a first down. A great
play, right? Wrong! “All their
inter-linemen were _ illegally
downfield,” said Fallon. ‘‘There
should have been a penalty on
the play.’’ As it was, the Hoyas
picked up the first down and

were not ready to quit. W&L
had the ball with mintues left in
the half and scored with 0:49 to
go. The key man in the series
was tailback Stewart Atkinson,
who caught a 35 yard pass and
scored on a two yard run to nar-
row the margin to 249 at
halftime.

In the second half, the
Generals ran off 22 straight
points while holding
Georgetown to three points.
Fallon called it, ‘‘the most en-
joyable half of coaching I have
had.’’ W&L scored once in the
third quarter on an 11 yard pass
to Richard Wiles from Rich

Piranian optimistic about
next year’s soccer team

by Tim Connors

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer Generals finished the
season with a record of 3-8-2,
but, according to Coach Rolf
Piranian, there are many
reasons why one should not look |
back on the season with a great
deal of disappointment.

The Generals fielded a very
young team this year, with only|
six graduating seniors on the
squad. Piranian will miss all
six, however, as he said that
“they each made a tremendous
contribution to W&L soccer.”’
The players which he cited are
co-captains Bill Stone and
Roger Yale, along with Todd
Tyson, Howie Collier, Woods
King and Chuck D’Auria. These
six combined with a promising
nucleus of underclassmen to
play what Piranian called ‘‘the
best fundamental soccer that
has been played here in three
years” (Piranian’s tenure as
head coach).

The season also had its share
of disappointments. Piranian
lamented his team’s inability to
‘play 90 minutes of good soc-
cer,”’ that the Generals had a
“few lapses’ of which the op-
ponents took advantage, and in
so doing, took an early lead in

most games. Conversely, the
Generals were plagued by
wasted scoring opportunities,
as their inability to put the ball
in the net when it counted most,
combined with a number of in-
juries, were the major factors
in W&L posting a losing record.

The Generals played one of
their most demanding
schedules ever, as only VMI
among their opponents had a
losing record. Two teams,
Elizabethtown and Lynchburg
colleges, received post-season
bids to play in the NCAA cham-
pionship for Division III. Next
season, Piranian anticipates
“changing the schedule just a

  

Rolf Piranian

little’ and he expects the
Generals to be ‘‘very com-
petitive.” Piranian maintains
“an optimistic outlook for next
season, as we (W&L) will be
returning the majority of a
young team.’’ Tri-captains
Dana Samuelson, Doug Dorsey
and Doug Seitz will try to lead
the returning talent from this
year, along with some of the
very talented ‘‘B’’ team
players.

eventually drove to the W&L 3
for the game winning kick.

From the way the game
started, it looked like W&L
could make reservations for an
early bus back to Lexington.
The Hoyas scored on their first
and last possessions of the first
quarter to take an early 14-0
lead. The Generals managed a
44 yard field by Randy Austin to
cut the lead to 14-3, but the
Hoyas scored twice to stretch
their lead to 24-3. One of these
scores, a 89 yard kickoff return,
should not have been allowed,
according to Fallon. ‘‘One of
our men was clipped on the
play,’’ said the coach, ‘‘and it
happened right in front of the of-
ficial.”

The Generals trailed 24-3, but

Bird places ninth
in regional meet

by Greg Branan
Despite finishing ninth in last
Saturday’s NCAA Qualifying
Meet, Rich Bird missed qualify-

‘ing for the NCAA National

Meet. Bob Bates, the only other
W&L runner, finished twenty-
third in the regional meet,
about two minutes behind Bird.

Of ten teams present, eight
were from Virginia. Only the
top two five man teams and the
top three individuals not on
those teams go on to the Na-
tionals next weekend.

Of the race, Coach Dick
Miller commented, ‘‘Rich Bird
ran his best race.’’ Bird’s time
was 26:07 on the five mile
course.

On the team as a whole for the
season, Miller commented that
“considering the number of
freshmen on the team, we did
relatively well.’’ Miller added
that he felt each team member
had improved individually to
some degree.

The Generals’ final record
was 7-8-1, and they finished fifth
in the ODAC.

Hachenburg. The freshman
quarterback enjoyed his best
game of the year, completing 18
of 27 passes for 248 yards and
one touchdown.

The fourth quarter saw the
Generals finally go ahead of the
Hoyas. W&L scored on a five
yard run by Chris Leiser to trail
24-22. Once again, the two point
attempt failed. The Generals
took over on the Hoyas’ 25 after
a fumble but a Hachenburg
pass was intercepted. A strong
rush forced a 16 yard punt, and
the Generals moved to the
Hoyas’ 12 before calling on Ran-
dy Austin. Austin’s field goal
with 3:21 left in the game gave
the Generals their 25-24 lead.

The Hoyas started their final
drive on the 13. They moved 84
yards on 14 plays before Cor-
coran ended the game. Two
plays particularly upset Fallon.
One was the fourth down pass,
while another officiating error
was ‘‘when they (the officials)

_ Stopped the clock to move the

markers. This is against the
rules.”” Unfortunately, these
rules are sometimes overlooked
and someone gets shortchang-
ed. This time it was W&L.

The 1978 football season is
over and the Generals, despite a
2-8 record, made some key im-
provements. The most impor-
tant of these is the emergence of
Rich Hachenburg as a capable
quarterback. Stewart Atkinson
had another outstanding
season, running for a season

Basketball

team
promising

by Bill Whalen

Washington and Lee head basketball
coach Verne Canfield projects an aura of
confidence — and he has good reason to do
so. In his fifteenth year at W&L, Canfield
has compiled a record of 225-116, in-
cluding last year’s 22-6 mark. Moreover,
he has posted a winning record each year
since 1966-67 and has coached W&L to the ©
ODAC basketball championship the last
three years. ‘‘This year’s team is a group
that can do the job at both ends of the
court,’’ says Canfield. ‘“‘We are ag-
gressive, intense and very proud.”’

The last two cager teams have gone 23-5
and 22-6, and the 1978-79 team is of the ,
same caliber. ‘‘We have potentially as
good a team as we have had the past two
years. This year’s team has better ver-
satility than in the past. Many players can
play more than one position.”’

The most notable figure gone from last
year’s squad is All- American Pat Dennis, '
who takes with him a 25 ppg average. To
counteract this, Canfield plans to go to a
more balanced attack. ‘‘We should have
five guys averaging in double figures,”’
said the coach. “Do not expect anyone.to
score more than 17 or 18 ppg.”’ The loss of
Dennis is also cushioned by the return of -
eight lettermen, including three year
starter and senior captain Mike Wenke
(5-10), and three year starter and senior
Dave Leunig (6-9). Other starters return-
ing are senior Ardith Collins (6-5) and
sophomore Rob Smitherman (6-7), who
shared time at the center position last |
year. The rest of the returning lettermen
are senior strong forward Jim Berlin

(6-5), junior small forward Tom Jeffries
(6-3), junior guard Pete Farrell (6-0) and
sophomore shooting guard Carby Hoy
(6-1). Nonlettermen on the squad are |
junior small forward Tracy Hodge (6-3)
and sophomore small forward R.J.
Scaggs (6-2).

Rounding out the squad are three
freshmen. They are 6-5 Travis Patterson,
who will be rotated between center and
power forward; 6-2 Clark New, who will
play at small forward; and 6-0 George
Spears, who will be worked as pointguard.

The probable starters will be Wenke at
point guard; Hoy at shooting guard; Jef-

“This team may be as good as we’ve

year’s squad, Stearns is confident of his
team’s ability.
is Last year, W&L amassed a 10-1 regular

fourth consecutive year W&L has finished
= in the top ten. This year’s team will have
to do without seventeen time All-
, American John Hudson, as well as school
record-holders Pete Meem and David
Kant, all graduates of 1978.

Stearns, who sports a .713 winning
percentage in twelve years, does have
} four All-Americans returning to the
squad. Among these are co-captains Keith
Romich and Chip Hoke. Romich, school
=» record holder in the 200 fly and 400 and 800
™ relays, and Hoke, a competitor in the
freestyle, backstroke, and _ individual
medley events, will team with fellow All-
Americans Bob Newcomb, a_ junior
» freestyler, and Jay Diesing, a sophomore

diver, to provide a strong base for Stearns
to build a championship team upon. Ex-
perienced returnees George Irvine, div-
ing, and free stylers Bill Ashe and Rob
Massie will provide the supporting cast.
Freshmen are expected to play a big role
on this year’s squad. Stearns hopes for big
things from first-year men Denny

year is through. Herb Gressens, a free

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

A call for help...

If all goes according to plan, it looks as though the
student body will be called into action next January to
aid in the final movement of books from McCormick
Library to the new campus facility. It’s an unor-
thodox plan, to say the least — classes haven’t been
officially cancelled at W&L in many years. More than
that, one is struck by the idealism in the plan: that
students will actually want to give a bit of their time
and energy to help open the library six months ahead
of schedule.

An incredible amount of time-has gone into the plan-
ning for this “‘moving day.” In an effort to make it an
enjoyable event, the committee in charge has planned
refreshments, gifts, and music throughout the day.
Finally, there will be a chance to “‘ring out the old,”’ in
a large party within the empty rooms of McCormick
Library. The day’s activities will certainly be one of
the greatest ‘happenings’ in the history of the
university — a celebration of the opening of its most
ambitious building project.

The senior class has patiently endured three years
of dynamite and digging; more than anyone else, they
should be glad to see a successful end to the library
project. Commerce school students should also
realize that an early move will facilitate restoration
of McCormick — and an end to the overcrowding in
Newcomb Hall. In the end, all students who must use
the W&L library system should be grateful for a
building that will offer increased space, round the
clock hours, and more comfortable surroundings. If
the university as a whole has ever had good reason to
celebrate, this is the time.

Still, the most attractive feature of the ‘‘moving
day”’ is the call for student participation by the
university. To put it quite simply, the university is
putting itself on the line — if the students don’t turn
out for the day’s activities, a later move may not be
feasible until April. Further restoration of the
academic buildings on campus (particularly McCor-
mick) will be delayed. But no one will be deprived
more than the students themselves, who will continue
to lack the first-class research facilities they need so
urgently.

I don’t believe that many universities extend their
trust to the students so totally. After years of hard
work, the administration has chosen to call the
undergraduates into action — to ask them to carry the
responsibility that ‘‘one last mile,’’ and then join in a
celebration for a job well done. Such confidence is
really rare these days. It is my hope that the students
(and faculty, and local residents) will turn out in
force for this project, to prove that confidence in their
responsibility isn’t such a risky proposition after all...

Editor:

It seems that we have arrived at that point at
which the W&L administration will have to
decide whether to unify or to separate the
Undergraduate and Law schools. While verbal
homage has been paid to the concept of ‘‘one stu-
dent body,” practical steps have been made in
the other direction.

While I have no burning preference for either
decision, I would like to see a choice made in
order to eliminate the hoopla surrounding the
issue. Students of both schools are worried that
they will become ‘‘second class students’’ or that
the administration somehow prefers the other
group. Library use, parking, housing, and now
graduation exercises have been drawn into the
confrontation as evidence of some prejudice
against one or the other group.

Positive steps can and must be taken, and
soon, to deliniate the position of the schools, in
order to stop this waste of effort and energy. It
simply is not that large an issue. If the Law
School is to become a separate entity, we need
only continue in the direction we have been tak-
ing, while discounting public statements to the
contrary. If the schools are to remain unified,
then calendars will have to be brougiit closer
together with the Undergraduate calendar being
brought more closely in line with that of the Law
School and most other universities and colleges I
can think of), and policies of sharing the
facilities of both schools will have to be
developed.

In either case, neither school need take a back
seat to the other, unless the current policy of
nondecision continues. In that case, everyone
loses.

Sincerely,
Steven L. Higgs ’80

Finally, to all of those who watched and later
commented on the coverage a hearty thank you.
I honestly hope everyone enjoyed it, and hope

very pleased with the result and believe we did
the school proud with our presentation.

Parking Problems; Delts respond

To The Editor:

I appreciate the fact that there is a serius park-
ing shortage at Washington and Lee, as evidenc-
ed by Mr. Keefe’s recent article. Unfortunately,
it does not seem that it will soon go away. What
Iwould like to see permanently eradicated is the
new notion by some members of the University
community that if you cannot find a parking
spot, simply create a new one. I refer specifical-
ly to the practice of some University employees
of leaving cars parked perpendicularly behind
other parked cars in between the freshmen
dorms and the Lee House.

At first it was merely an irritant to move the
one car which exercised this habit (the keys,
after all, were left in the car, and a note was left
saying that if the car was blocking someone else,
then if the car’s owner were contacted, he/she
would move it). Now, regrettably, the practice
has spread, and the number of cars has
multiplied.

Please keep in mind how gross and unfair this
is. Should we, as students, simply create new
parking spaces outside the door of the coop, or
park our cars on the Colonnade? There is sheer
competition for the spots (free enterprise,
maybe) and it is every man for himself. It seems
that whenever students try to fight back and
park in an unusual spot, they receive tickets
from Murph or Lexington’s “‘finest’”’ (and a tow-
ing job to boot). Shouldn’t the same threat hang
over the heads of the people now parking in this

So, please, I implore you, MOVE YOUR CAR
— I don’t want to have to find you, and I don’t
want to have to pay for another dent in my car if
I get angry.

To The Editor:
This letter is in response to R.S. Keefe’s letter
in the Nov. 9 issue.
Fraternities are making an effort to improve
relationships with the community. It does not
‘help matters at all when someone slanders a
fraternity without first investigating the facts. I
have encountered broken glass in the streets of
Lexington also, but I did not accuse the nearest

residence of being responsible for the broken
glass.

One does expect the Director of the News Of-
fice to be fairer in his accusations.

Sincerely,

a __—
Sir:

I was rather intrigued by a letter to the editor
last week in which a certain R.S. Keefe, whoever
he might be, had a close encounter of the worst
kind (broken beer bottles—not more than two) in
the street in front of my present residence, the
Delt house.

If I dare suggest it—while freedom of speech
still exists in Lexington—Mr. Keefe should con-
sider a few tidbits before he hurls his next ac-
cusation toward the Delt house or any other
fraternity on campus.

First, beer bottles in front of the Delt house
Thursday should not imply that a Delt deposited
them there. Wednesday night (the only night
during the week a party can be held, no matter
how peaceful) we had a grain party. I doubt any
Delts were interested in bottled beer that night.

Second, I also doubt that any Delt would break
beer bottles on the side of the road between two
of our cars where a car parking or pulling out
would receive a flat tire.

May I also point out that many people not in
our fraternity were attending out rather tame
party. (Sorry, no broken bones, gatoring, Pagan
rituals, or noise violations.) Any one of the
visitors could have caused your inconvience in
front of our house.

As a final note, I do not, nor ever have, wanted
your sympathy for ours or any other Washington
and Lee fraternity.

All I have ever wanted was a fair chance for
our fraternity and the other fraternities on cam-
pus. I obviously cannot find that chance in your,
sir.

Respectfully,

acting. Sonia Braga in the title
role is absolutely beautiful. Her
sensitive, totally unpretentious
characterization of Dona Flor is
flawless. Jose Wilker, her
disreputable husband, is
perfectly suited for his cheap
hood role, and Mauro Men-
donca, the druggist, executes
an excellent job of portraying
the well-meaning, but
thoroughly boring second part-
ner. '

Musically, Chico Buarque has
done a fine job of scoring the
film. Every theme, including
the pompous oboe for the se-
cond husband is done with a
delightful flair.

Add up a fine director, ex-
cellent actors, and an_ in-

teresting score, finish it up with
an easy-going humorous touch,
and the result is one of the finest
films to come along in yars. If
Heaven Can Wait is a mixed-up

Fencing Club beats
James Madison

Last Sunday the Washington
and Lee fencing club traveled to
James Madison University for a
scrimmage. The fencing club
defeated JMU’s team with an
overall score of 17 bouts to
James Madison’s 13. In the dif-
ferent weapon competitions the
foil squad won 10 bouts to

Inter-Varsity Christian
Fellowship is sponsoring a
CLOTHING DRIVE this Thurs-
day and Friday, Nov. 16 and 17.

All of the clothes which are
given will be donated to a local
organization, Total Action
Against Proverty (TAP).

They will distribute the dona-
tions to people in our communi-
ty who express a need for them.
We would greatly appreciate
any contribution, no matter how
old or worn out the clothes are.
You may bring your old clothes
either to the University Book
Store (Co-Op) or the lobby of
the Dining Hall.

JMU’s 6; and the epee squad
won 5 bouts with James
Madison winning only 4 bouts;
and the sabre squad lost 7 to 2.
This was a strong showing.

Fencing foil for W&L on Sun-
day were Clyde Harkrader and
Colt Puryear, both freshmen;
Willie Mackie and John
Stathakis, both sophomores;
and Fletcher Harkrader, a
junior. The epee squad con-
sisted of freshman Dave
Hepler, sophomore Bill Sherwin
and junior Paul Nathan. Dave
Hepler also fenced sabre for the
first time in competition with
the rest of the sabre squad:
juniors Dave Bryant, Dave
Barnes and Bill Hill. Freshman
Steve King did an excellent job
officiating the foil competition,
since he had sustained an in-
jury.

Dr. Worth, the team coach
and advisor sacrificed his Sun-
day to go with the team. His
coaching, moral support and
generosity were invaluable to
the team. We are looking for our
first scrimmage to be only one
of many victories in the upcom-
ing season.

Cockpit
Attractions

(continued from page 5)
Wednesday, Nov. 29, the band
Trigger Happy will return to the
Cockpit. They last played in the
Cockpit on Oct. 7 to a very en-
thusiastic crowd, and sought
another date based on the
crowd’s reception! The
members of the band are Gary
Scarborough (guitar, vocals),
Gregg Lardieri (piano, organ),
Tim Lawrence (bass), Fred
Tepper (guitar, pedal steel),
and Rick Weisenmiller
(drums). Although some of
their material is original, most
of their songs are from Little
Feat, Marshall Tucker, the
Alman Brothers and J.J. Cale.
Their sound is remarkably
similar to all of the above
bands, and after a few minutes
of listening to them, you will be
able to see and hear that. There
will be a cover charge of $1 for
all W&L students, $1.50 for
everyone else. All of the pro-
ceeds at the door will pay the
band for this performance,
which should be excellent. They
will start at 8 and play until
closing.

Also in the Cockpit that week
will be Eddie Adcock and II
Generation. This professional
band has six albums printed,
and is another example of a
band who wanted a return date
because of the crowd’s recep-
tion at their first gig, last Sept.
13. They have just finished a
tour of the West Coast, which
was very successful. They play
a hybrid of country-rock, with
the emphasis on rock. Eddie
plays banjo and Telecastei and
sings along with his wife, Mar-
tha, who also plays guitar.
Johnny Castle plays an in-
imitable bass guitar, and they
are assisted on the drums by a
musician whose name _ is
unavailable at this time. This
will be Christmas Party Time in
the Cockpit, and Santa will be
selling mugs of foamy stuff to
all college women for 25. BE
there!

Phineas: Equal Rights

There seems to be a plethora
of new groups on campus
recently, so I consider it my
civic duty to give a quick com-
mentary on one of the most con-
troversial of them.

W.O.M.B.A.T. is the Women’s
Organization for the Mandatory
Battle Against Truth and it had
to hit campus sooner or later.
They are obviously proponents
of the E.R.A. believing that
men and women should be
equal in every way. But WOM-
BAT isn’t satisfied with the
E.R.A., and they would like to
carry the idea one miniscule
step further.

They are presently lobbying
for the following laws: 1) that
children be brought up by
strangers because mothers are
more concerned with ‘‘finding
themselves” than with the hap-
piness of the child, 2) that dur-
ing at least the last three hours
of labor in the child-bearing
process the father must be tied
up and whipped so that he will
feel as much pain as the mother
and care for the child that much

more because of the pain he
went through for it, 3) that men
must wear kilts and shave their
legs, and 4) that men must wear
jock straps at all times. (“If we
have to keep our supple appen-
dages confined so must they.’’)

The group does not have a
large following at W&L but
there are a number of law
students involved. After all,
they applauded when the
Supreme Court handed down a
decision that permitted a
woman reporter in the Yankee
locker room. So I can’t com-
prehend what all the hub-bub
was about when I decided to use
the ladies’ bathroom in Lewis
Hall. They called me obscene,
vile, and lecherous. I told them
that if separate but equal
schools weren’t good enough for
the blacks, then separate but
equal bathrooms weren’t good
enough for me. Besides, the
bathrooms aren’t even equal.
Theirs is pink and ours is blue,
and everyone knows that pink is
more aesthetically pleasing to
the eye.

 

Frisbee

Though Washington and Lee
University has over a dozen
organizations created for the
“throwers’’ on campus, there
exist none to satisfy the ‘‘skip-
pers” among us. Recent efforts
at alleviating this injustice have
met with some success, though,
as the University Athletic Com-
mittee has unofficially
recognized a campus Frisbee
club. The representatives to the
committee described the objec-
tive of the club: ‘‘to encourage
greater appreciation of the
Frisbee. This appreciation
‘ranges from the purest recrea-
tional enjoyment to highly ad-
vanced competition.”’

Frustrated “skippers,” your
‘time has come! Join us at our
first meeting this Tuesday,

‘114 at the University Center.

The ball and the frisbee,
sport’s two major forms, evolv-
ed from a common ancestor —
the rock. Early rock athletes
were divided into two camps:
throwers and_ skippers.
Throwers like fat, hunky rocks,
something they could get a grip
on, and skippers like the
smooth, flat, skinny ones for
“‘pittying’”’ on the pond. But
there was something about rock
throwing that seemed to bring ©
out the aggressiveness of its
people. Before long, they were
throwing at each other. The
skippers, on the other hand,
were a more esthetic group.
Sometimes they didn’t even
both to count the pitty-pittys. It
was the beauty of the flight that
turned them on, these
forefathers of Frisbee.

EC Votes in Favor
of Grade Review

by Randy Smith

The Executive Committee
voted unanimously Monday
night to recommend to
Washington and Lee’s faculty
that students have the right to
question and appeal the final
grade received in a course.

The statement adopted by the
EC would give students ‘‘the
right to review and discuss all
graded material and any factor
entering into the final grade.”
Students with a_ grievance
would then be able to get a
review of the grade with the
head of the department involv-
ed.

Presently, W&L has no pro-
cess through which a student
can appeal a final grade if he
disagrees with the professor’s
evaluation of his work. Also, the
department head cannot now
overturn any grade given by a
professor in his department.

The EC’s statement—perhaps
the most significant action
taken by the Committee this
year—also recommends that
professors provide a course
syllabus at the beginning of the
term which outlines a schedule
of assignments and an ‘‘approx-
imate percentage analysis of

the final grade.”’
The statement adopted dur-
ing Monday’s regularly

scheduled meeting was based
on the recommendations of an

said that “‘it’s spitting in the
wind”’ to ask professors to give
up their present autonomy in
determining grades to the head
of the department.

‘We shouldn’t be hesitant at.

all if we feel a student has a
right to review,’’ Willis urged. |

Despite the feelings of some
EC members that the faculty
would never agree to such a
proposal, all Committee
members present agreed with
the principle of the statement
and voted to recommend the
grade review plan to the facul-
ty.

and benefits of Independent Ex-
ams, Student Body President
Beau Dudley called the exams
“one of the most important
parts of the honor system
here.”’

His comment came during a
general procedure meeting with
freshmen concerning Indepen-

dent Exams Tuesday evening in
a crowded Lee Chapel. Atten-
dance was mandatory for all
freshmen.

Dudley said that while he con-
siders Independent Exams a
strain on the honor system and
a responsibility, he feels this is
a good chance for students to
show what Independent Exams
mean to them.

The best policy for avoiding

EC Briefs Freshmen on Exams

 

Honor Violations is simply not
to talk about them, he said.

Students were reminded to
pick up exam envelopes at the

_registrar’s office and turn them

into professors during the first
class meeting next week. Pro-
fessors will designate on the
folder where exams are to be
taken.

Any exam turned in late or
taken in a room other -than the

ed.

Dean Huntley, originally
Scheduled to deliver introduc-
tory remarks, entered as
Dudley dismissed the freshmen
class. He detained the freshmen

for a few remarks, concluding

the brief meeting by comparing
the honor system with the color
yellow, Saying “You recognize
it when you see it, but it is hard
to describe. ’’
 

Buckley to speak
Wednesday

Former Senator James L.
Buckley will speak at
Washington and Lee University
at 8 p.m. on Wednesday, Dec. 6,
in Lee Chapel.

Buckley was elected to the
U.S. Senate in 1970 as a can-
didate of New York’s Conser-
vative Party, even though he
was registered Republican: He
was defeated for re-election in
1975 by Daniel P. Moynihan (D-
NY).

Perhaps one of Buckley’s best
known achievements as Senator
was The Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act of 1974,
often referred to as_ the
“Buckley Amendment.”’

The Buckley Amendment
allows a student to examine his
permanent record maintained
by educational institutions to
assure the accuracy of its con-
tents.

Buckley’s principal commit-
tee assignments during his six
years in the Senate were Public
Works, Interior, Commerce and
Budget.

His major legislative in-
terests were: the right against
permissive abortion; protection
of the rights of. parents and the

family from governmental in-'

terference; and the protection
of state and local governments
from interference by federal
agencies.

Buckley was also a leading
advocate for a strong defense
and was an early critic of the
politicy of detente.

During his second year in of-
fice, Buckley was named
among the hardest-working and
brightest members of the
Senate in a survey of legislative
staff assistants. In 1976, he was
listed as one of the ten best
Senators by syndicated colum-
nist Jack Anderson.

Presently, Buckley is serving
as director of the investment
banking firm of Donaldson,
Lufkin, and Jenrette.

He is also the vice chairman
of the Republican National
Committee’s Advisory Council
on General Government and is
Chairman of the Subcommittee
on the Rediscovery of
Federalism:

Sen. Buckley is the younger
brother of the well-known
writer and syndicated colum-
nist William F.. Buckley.

The lecture is being jointly
funded by the Mock Convention
and Contact Committees.

Dean Robert Huntley (left) posses with new members of Phi Eta Sigma after their induction Tuesday.

“It’s sort of sad that the sor-
riest combo or dreariest dance
excites more attention or en-
thusiasm from us than the in-
itiation of these young men
whose performance’ and
achievement is emblematic of
the very raison d’etre for the ex-
istence of this University,”
commented Dean Robert
Huntley, coordinator of the
freshman year.

Huntley said that the Phi Eta
Sigma ceremony “goes largely
unnoticed by the University
community as a whole.”

“Such characteristic reserve
toward any organization bear-
ing Greek letters becomes more
explicable when one recalls that
Phi Eta Sigma is not a fraterni-
ty, but a society—a society
dedicated to the ideals of
scholarship and high personal
achievement,”’ Huntley  con-
tinued.

Dean Huntley said that those
students inducted into the socie-
ty Tuesday had achieved ‘‘that
level of intellectual, or at least
academic excellence toward
which we all—faculty, ad-
ministration, and _ student

body—traditionally genuflect
but otherwise ignore.”

The Housing Game—W&L Style

The Great Race Is On

by Chris Chatfield

From this part of the year on,
Washington and Lee students
begin a wild search for a room
or an apartment for next year.
And for the student inexperienc-
ed in the housing game, there
may not seem to be enough
places to live in Lexington.

Many questions are raised:
about University housing, living
in town, and living in the coun-
try. .

William N. Mohler, Director
of University Services, is in
charge of University housing
and can also supply students
with a list of local houses and
apartments for rent.

‘The University has a fairly
large housing system for its
students,”’ Mohler said.

The University has housing
for approximately 275  up-
perclass men and law students
in dormitories and the Woods
Creek Apartments.

Baker Dormitory can house
37 law students, while the
number of law students in the

Woods Creek Apartments
varies from year to year. This
year about 50 law students live
in Woods Creek.

Mohler said that about 130 up-
perclassmen live at Woods
Creek, while another 30 live in
the two Lee Houses. Davis
Dorm can house up to 45 up-
perclassmen, but due to the
large size of this year’s
freshman class, only 26 places
were available to the up-
perclassmen, Mohler said.

To sign up for University
housing, students should turn in
room assignment forms before
Feb. 1. These forms can be ob-
tained in Mohler’s office.

Mohler said, ‘“The University
is not responsible for finding
off-campus housing for the
students. However, we do have
a list of houses and apartments
for rent that the owners have
told us about. The University
acts solely as a clearing house
for this information and can not
offer endorsements for them.”

According to Mohler, Mead
Associates; at 21 N. Main St., is
the largest rental agency in

Lexington. Mead rents the
Country Club apartments (just
outside of town), the Nelson
Street Apartments (in town), as
well as several houses. _

“We try to do everything we
can to find students places to
live,’’ said G. Otis Mead. “‘Itis a
very difficult situation.”

Students should apply at
‘Mead Assoc. directly after
Christmas, with Alice Strecker.
Students are served on a first
come, first served basis. There
is no charge for these services.

John M. Ewing has about 32
apartments (from one to five
bedrooms) to lease. These are
his own apartments and are of
various prices and _ locations.
Ewing can be reached at his
‘home phone number: 463-3272.

Patricia K. Connor Realty, on
Washington Street, as part of
their ‘‘good will’ policy, keeps
a running file on people they
know of who are renting proper-
ty and will give these names to
students. These services are
also free.

You can always try Mr. Duck
at Central Lunch on Main
Street. He often has information
on people renting houses and he
loves to help University
students. And across Main St.,
Clyde Mull of College Inn has
many one-room efficiency
apartments on his upper floors.

So, the great ‘apartment
race” is on! Keep your eyes and
ears open, and make your move
soon.

Many people in Lexington
rent rooms to students but do
not advertise, relying instead
on word of mouth publicity. If
you hear of someone who might
have a place to rent, go see
them. At worst, they will be
happy to put your name on their
waiting list.

duPont shows
Liao prints

by Don Noble

The current exhibition in du-
Pont Gallery, a show of prints
and paintings by Liao Shiou-
ping, will be on view until Dec.
15.

Mr. Liao was born in Taipei,
Taiwan in 1936 and has studied
art at the National Taiwan Nor-
mal University, Tokyo Univer-
sity on Education, Ecole Natio-
nle Superieure des Beaux-arts
(Paris) and other schools. He is
presently a Professor of Art at
the University of Tsukuba,
Tokyo.

Mr. Liao has shown his work
in numerous One Man and
Group Exhibitions throughout
the world and has won many
prizes and awards. He has also
published two books — The Art
of Printmaking and Apprecia-
tion of Modern Prints.

Mr. Liao’s education in art
was originally western in style,
with much emphasis on
realism. However, during his
studies in Paris, he decided to
incorporate his Oriental
heritage into his style. As a
result, his work now is a com-
bination of traditional Chinese
images and contemporary
Western form and technique.

In order to incorporate a
Chinese character into his
work, Mr. Liao had to abandon
his western background in art
and concentrate on the Oriental
view of nature, time, and life.
This outlook is different from
the western conception and in-
volves a different philosophy of
art.

This can be seen most clearly
in the gate images that Mr. Liao
uses, which are very represen-
tative of his style. They draw
from traditional Chinese
themes and are meant to imply
the meaning of life. As man
goes. through life, he travels
through and opens many gates
in order to understand the world

in which he lives. The gates are
symbols of man’s spiritual
journey through life and link the
past, present, and future with
regard to time. Through the
gate, the mystery of life is
revealed, and this is the
message that Liao wishes to
convey.

Liao’s other symbols are
usually simple forms set in ver-
tical and horizontal frames
which imply stability and per-
manence. These draw from the
Oriental outlook on life as an at-
tempt to build in an irrational
world a constant world of idea
— the search for the eternal
truth.

His works also emphasize his
belief that growth and develop-
ment is achieved through the in-
teraction of opposite poles, such
as sun and moon, heaven and
earth, or Yin and Yang. His
most recent expression has
been the adding of natural illu-
sions to the symbolic forms to
suggest the Eastern idea of
matter and spirit merging into
one.

Mr. Liao’s work uses an inter-
national language by express-
ing Oriental ideas through
Western media and technique.
It presents a very different
philosophy from that which we
are familiar with, and because
of its wumiqueness is very
refreshing.

 

East meets West in duPont Gallery. An oriental heritage and occidental training come together in the
unique points of Liao Shiou-ping which will hang in duPont Gallery through December 15.

Film Society presents:

Chinese Roulette

by Carren Kaston
The Washington and Lee Film
Society will present Rainer
Werner Fassbinder’s Gothic
thriller Chinese Roulette on
Thursday and Friday nights,

November 30 and December 1,
at 8 p.m. The movie was
scheduled for Thursday and
Friday in order to leave free for
students the week before ex-
aminations.

 

{Contest!

On Wednesday, January 10,
Washington and Lee will move
into its new library. Books will
be moved from McCormick
Library to The new library. Un-
paralleled academic complex
that it will be, the new library
does lack one thing.

The new library lacks a
name. In an effort to further in-
volve the student body in the
new library, the Ring-tum Phi
is sponsoring a ‘‘Name That
Library” contest. The rules are
simple.

Entries are to be submitted to
the Ring-tum Phi mailbox in
Carole Chappell’s office in the
Student Center. Each entry
should be accompanied by a
brief (25-50 word) statement ex-
plaining the proposed name.

Entries will be judged on the
basis of originality and aptness
and the three best entries will
each be awarded a six pack of
beer of their choice.

Go to it boys.

Cye And Car: Foon The Bookstore

The academic atmosphere swirls with worries.
Papers unwritten, barely thought upon; five hun-
dred pages of Victorian novels (worse yet,
Chaucer) unread; computer terminals
unavailable; and equations, mathematical or
personal, unbalanced. Then the student’s
camel’s back comes near to breaking by the
straws of Christmas’s joys and chores. :

What to give to whom? Where to buy the
perfect present for the perfect person? In such
dire circumstances I will gladly take on, in the
interest of future student sanity, the unlikely role
of Christmas angel.

Books, of course, are surely the varied
delightful solution for all Christmas-gift panic.
They do not disappear with large gulps; they do
not go out of style and they come in all sizes and
prices; lastly they are not made of plastic nor do
their bearings wear out. Books are gifts that
last!

So let’s get on with making an all purpose gift
list so that the chores become joys.

(1) For younger brothers and sisters, nieces
and nephews — Castle; How To Eat Fried
Worms; Macmillan Dictionary For Young Peo-
ple.

(2) For the grandmother who always
remembers your birthday with generosity:
American Album; Country Lady Calendar; Let-
ters Of E.B. White.

(3) For the father who wonders what the hell
you are doing with all that money up there —
show, him with: War And Remembrance; In
Search Of History; General Lee’s College.

(4) For the mother who doesn’t ask the wrong
questions and who laughs at the right time: Julia
Child And Company; Wildflower Gardening; Ar-
chitecture Of Historic Lexington.

(5) For the one-and-only girl of the moment:

Earth From Above; Doonesbury’s Greatest
Hits; The Prophet.
Betty Munger

From the Record Shop:

Aural gratification — what a nice gift idea.

Here are some selections from the Record Store
that might help you if you’re really in a pinch.
(1) For your sister who just returned from col-
lege a changed woman; depressed about her
future, despondent about her grades, and
nauseous over her love life: Sylvia Plath
Reading Her Poetry; Let It Bleed, The Rolling
Stones; Freakin’ At The Freaker’s Ball, Shel
Silverstine.

(2) For your little brother who put ground
glass on your morning grapefruit and thinks he’s
such a comedian: That’s Not Funny, That’s
Sick,” National Lampoon; The Mothers,
Fillmore East — June 1971, Zappa.

(3) For Uncle Charlie who can’t stop talking
about the wonderful good old days: The Wit and
Widsom of Will Rogers; Great American
Speeches, Vol. III, 1931-1947; Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr., What I Oppose The War In Vietnam.

(4) For your old high school buddy who just got
back from N.Y.C. and thinks he’s so cool and
cosmopolitan: Southern Prison Blues, Recorded
at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, Angola.

(5) For your other old buddy who just grew one
of those funny pointed beards after taking his
first course in Marxist theory in school: Bertolt
Brecht Before The Committee On Un- American
Activities; Great Actors Of The Past.

(6) For your mother who you love: Dylan
Thomas reading — A Children’s Christmas In
Wales.

(7) For your father who you love: Messiah,
G.F. Handel, Neville Marriner

This second offering of the
film series will be shown as
before in classroom ‘‘C’’ of
Lewis Hall, the Law School. All
members of the university and
town communities are invited
to attend. Admission is free.

Along with the directors
Werner Herzog and Wim
Wenders, Fassbinder has made
the newly resurgent West Ger-
man cinema the most active
and creative in Europe at the
present time. Chinese Roulette
(1976) explores the relationship
between a paralyzed teenaged
girl on the edge of puberty, her
philandering parents, and their
lovers. In the process, the
movie challenges’ the
stereotyped sentimentality with
which we treat the cripple in
our society and art.

The movie progresses from
the beautifully composed,
unsettling opening shots, in
which it is unclear where we are
spatially and what the relation-
ships is between the people we
are watching, through a series
of tautly paced scenes which
make brilliant use of delayed in-
formation. At the end of the
movie, the characters gather to
play ‘Chinese roulette,” ‘a
made-up parlor game ox terrify-
ing psychological sadism.

Unique thrills

Fassbinder’s film is a master-
piece of tension. For the man-
datory chase sequences of
many ‘“‘thrillers,’”’ this movie
substitutes unpredictably paced
human exchange. Because the
movie’s characters exist in a
familial relationship to each
other, the tension of the usual
‘thriller’? genre is im-
measurably intensified and
complicated. When the
suspense is infused with cruel-
ty, this ‘“‘thriller’’ becomes

Comes a western Weekly Calendar

by Dick Barron

This past week I got a chance
to see a film which, although not
currently in Lexington,
deserves a good look. It’ll be
around for Christmas, I’m sure.

Comes a Horseman should
dispel any rumors about the
death of the cowboy film. The
chivalry of the West rides again
in the classic tradition of the
Gene Autry shoot-em-ups. I sug-
gest Autry here, because like
his old serial, Comes A
Horseman is set in the twentieth
century with airplanes and
automobiles. But horses and
cattle and the open-range are
very much alive in Alan J.
Pakula’s latest film.

Pakula, who added driving
suspense to The Parallax View
and who brought crisp energy to
All the President’s Men, brings
his own special brand of direc-
tion to this film. Through a com-
bination of brilliant motion
shots and tricky editing, this

becomes one of the most visual-
ly exciting films of the recent
year.

The tranquility of the dinner
table, and the chaos of the cattle
drive are each emphasized and
strengthened chrough these
clever techniques. When the
script calls for suspense, the

editing is flawless, establishing

the perfect rhythm and pace.

In addition, the 1940s type
water-color tint is well conceiv-
ed as a means of setting the at-
mosphere and adding beauty to
scenic vistas.

Jane Fonda as a feisty ranch
girl, and James Caan, her

Sparring-partner turned helper, -

are impressive, playing every
scene with agility and wit.
Fonda, the cold, lonely
woman against the world, and
Caan, the ex-soldier who comes
back to the ranch, hate and
later come to love each other in
some of the best battle-of-the-

SBC sponsors
Eliot reading

The Sweet Briar Social Ac-
tivities Committee is sponsor-
ing a ‘‘Cocktail Party” with a
difference. It will be a reading
of the play by this name by T.S.
Eliot, and it promises to be
more intoxicating to the mind
than to the body.

The party in the drama,
which brings together some of
the more intelligent members
of the London social set, reveals
that even these beautiful people
have their actute psychological
problems. Interpreting these
characters will be several of
Sweet Briar’s best known ac-
tresses, who will be joined by
members of the English Club at
Washington and Lee. The
reading will be given in the
Wailes Center Lounge on
Wednesday, December 6, at 7
p.m., and all interested are cor-
dially invited to come and par-
ticipate in a question-answer
period led by Professor John N.
Swift of W&L.

The late T.S. Eliot, best
known for his controversial,
symbolic poems, ‘“‘The Waste
Land,” ‘‘The Hollow Men,”’ and
“The Love Song of J. Alfred
Prufrock,”’ labeled his 1949 play
a “Comedy,” and it does glitter
with bright clashes of wit. But
beneath the sophisticated sur-
face runs deep currents of
spiritual distress and moral
confusion. Hosts Edward and
Lavinia are in a marital crisis
as they learn about affairs in
which they and their friends are

‘tangled. To this discomfort, an

unknown and uninvited guest
probes into their lives in the
belief that they must be ‘‘strip-

‘ ped naked to their souls.”’

Because of the poetic form

,and demanding characteriza-

tion, most of the roles have been

‘pre-cast, but the audience will,

participate in the discussion
that will involve both readers
and listeners, students and
faculty. The promises to be a
very special ‘“‘party’’ on
December 6.

: grinding

sexes scenes since Bogart met
Bacall.

But their battle with each
other is minute compared to
their fight with Jason Robards,
who plays one of the most evil
ranch owners ever to dlacken
the silver screen. He’s a guy
you just love to hate. Not only
does he do bad things, he ob-
viously enjoys doing bad things.
Everybody in the audience is
their teeth over
Robards.

The supporting cast is quite
good. Whether sitting around
the campfire and playing folk
songs with Caan, or helping
Robards to plot his dastardly
deeds, every actor executes his
role with skill.

The script has its flaws, and
for a while, we don’t really
know what’s going on, but once
the film rolls into the cattle-
drive scenes, there’s no turning
back — you’re hooked into your
seat.

Some will say this is a film
about women’s lib — N.O.W.’s
version of the old West — with
Fonda leading the way. Maybe
she’s not in dresses, a demure
little ranch girl, but she’s not
overbearing either, especially
when Caan comes along and
knocks the chip off her shoulder
to even up the score. We could
call this a film about partner-
ship — two people united in
standing up for their beliefs.

Comes A Horseman brings
back the days when movies
were exciting, and you knew
who to pull for in the big shoot-

The Society’s debut was highly

the first night, and a capacity
crowd of 75 the second, night.
Contributions have continued to
come in, although the Society is

snnawena 1070.10 the Musical Mainstream aevnevey

The end of 1978 is almost upon
us, and this being the last issue
of the Ring-tum Phi for the fall,
we at Musical Mainstream
throught we’d tie up a few loose
ends. First, as is the annoying
habit of music writers
everywhere, our nominations
for the best albums of 1978 (in
no particular order ).

Peter Gabriel: Peter Gabriel
(second album) — brilliant
songwriting and first rate pro-
duction by Robert Fripp help
this LP equal and perhaps sur-
pass the standards set by
Gabriel in his first solo release.

Tom Robinson Band: Power
in the Darkness —no-frills rock
‘n roll returns with a bang.
Distinguished from other new
wave releases by the quality of
the songwriting and instrumen-
tal virtuosity.

 

i}
Tom Robinson

Sea Level: Cats on the Coast’’
— the jazz influences of this
band created a truly unique
sound which gave a new life to
southern rock. Who needs an
Allman Brothers reunion?

Who: Who Are You’’ — the
appeal of this album is definite-
ly there, but we can’t pin it
down. ‘‘Who Are You”’ seems to
fuse the songwriging style of
“Tommy” with the advanced
instrumentation of
“Quadrophenia.”

Rolling Stones: Some Girls —
not definitive Stones by any
means, but these are the Roll-
ing Stones and even mediocre
work by this band is superior to
the best of most other groups.

“blue wave’’ is upon us. As the
favorable review in ‘Rolling
Stone’’ would indicate, the ap-
peal of the Allstars transcends
local boundaries.

Bruce Springsteen: Darkness
on the Edge of Town — was it
worth the wait? Well, maybe
not, but it seems as though a lot
of people let their expectations
cloud their judgment. This may
not be ‘‘Born To Run”’ but it is a
great record nonetheless.

Lou Reed: Street Hassle — an
artistic re-awakening by one of
rock’s pioneering forces.

Boomtown Rats: Boomtown
Rats — ‘‘One of the most stunn-
ing left field debut albums since
Bruce Springsteen’ (Stereo
Review)

Dan Fogelberg/Tim
Weisberg: Twin Sons of Dif-
ferent Mothers — not par-
ticularly significant, but a very
pleasant experimental col-
laboration which showcases the
talents of both performers.

Random Notes

As a quick glance through the
above might indicate, 1978 was
not a particularly asupicious
year in the world of rock ’n roll.
Many of the high hopes built up
in 1977 were dashed this year.
The great promise displayed by
the Dave Edmunds-Nick Lowe-
Graham Parker axis was never
realized, and the surge of in-
terest in local and regional
bands here in the U.S. produced
nothing more interesting than
Devo. For the second con-
secutive yar, Jeff Beck released
no new material (though he is
rumored to be in the studio at
present). However, the lack of
new LPs from Pink Floyd and
Led Zeppelin was a definite
plus.

A number of artists released
particularly disappointing
albums in 1978, among them:
Styx; Emerson, Lake &
Palmer; Genesis; Boston; and
last but certainly not least, Bob
Dylan. The already dismal
Street Legal was not at all imr-
pvoed by the background vocals
of the Mormon Tabernackle
Choir.

And finally, on the local
scene, it’s time somebody
thanked Burr Datz for the im-

Students Robbed of Stereos
Over Thanksgiving Break

Over $3,800 worth of stereo
and photographic equipment
was reported stolen from Phi
Kappa Sigma fraternity over
the Thanksgiving break.

According to - Lexington
Police Chief James A. Kirby,
the burglars apparently entered
the fraternity from a fire
escape ladder on the side of the
house, breaking a window to get
in.

Kirby said that University

Proctor Charles F. ‘Murph”
Murray discovered the break-in
the next day, Friday, Nov. 24,
and reported it to the police.

C. Douglas Davis reported
$1,300 in stereo’ yuipment and a
$300 loss of a Minolta camera
and 55 mm lens.

Geoffrey Sisk lost $940 worth
of stereo components and a
Nikormat camera valued at
$250.

Greek Novelist
to Lecture

Vassilis Vassilikos, noted
Greek novelist and journalist,
will deliver a lecture and
reading at Washington and Lee
University in Payne Hall next
Wednesday, Dec. 6, at4p.m.

This will be the first visit to
Washington and Lee for the
Greek author, whose last tour of
the United States was in 1959
under the auspices of a Ford
Foundation grant.

A movie based upon
Vassilikos’ most popular novel,
“Z,’’ will be shown Tuesday,
Dec. 5, at 7:30 p.m. in duPont
Auditorium.

Vassilikos was born in
Kavala, Grecce, in 1933, and
has published both poetry and
fiction which has_ been
translated into 16 languages.
Books of his to appear in the
United States include ‘The
Plant, the Well, the Angel,”

“The Photographs,” and ‘‘The
Harpoon Gun,”’ as well as ‘‘Z.””

A study of Greek society in
the decade preceding the col-
onels’ coup, ‘‘Outside the
Walls,” was published in the
United States and is the first
work of real-life commentary
by Vassilikos to appear in the
United States, according to
James Boatwright, professor of
English at Washington and Lee
and coordinator of the visit.

A reception will take place in
the English seminar room
following the Wednesday after-
noon lecture and reading. The
public is invited to attend both
events.

Vassilikos’ visit — to

Washington and Lee is spon-
sored by the Glasgow Endow-

losing $1,000 in stereo equip-
ment.

All three students are
sophomores living in the frater-
nity house.

Take ‘‘extra precautions

“We may get lucky and
recover this,” said Chief Kirby
about the stereo and
photographic equpment stolen
from Phi Kap.

He said that in the last two
years, “most” of the stereo
equipment stolen from W&L
students during vacations has
been recovered in town by the
Lexington police.

But the Police Chief urged
students to take “extra precau-
tions”’ before leaving Christmas
vacation, suchas:

—lock stereos in a closet in
addition to locking the room;

—students living in residen-
tial areas should ‘‘form a buddy
system” with their neighbors
and tell neighbors when they
are leaving town so someone is
watching the house;

—leave lights on in the house
during the vacation period;

—write down the serial
numbers of stereo equipment so
that it can be identified;

—tell the police when you will
be out of town and they will
check your house three times a
week while you are gone.

“Crime is everywhere and
it’s getting worse,’’ Kirby warn-
ed.

Career Assistance Available

by David Greer

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity offers its students a large
number of services to help the
student both at school and after
graduation. Among them is the
Office of Career Development
and Placement.

The office adjoins the recep-
tionist’s in the Student Center,
and is directed by Assistant
Dean of Students Mike Cappeto.

True, the office has a rather
formidable title. For those just
out of high school, it may evoke
images of flunky guidance
counselors or shrill-voiced proc-
tors handing out SAT’s on
Saturday morning.

But Cappeto is no flunky nor
is he a shrill-voiced proctor. He
won’t tell you that you must be a
geologist when you’ve always
wanted to pilot the Goodyear
blimp.

What Cappeto does is help
students plan their futures by
helping them select a major,
establish a career goal, secure
employment or get into
graduate school.

Cappeto says that he has
many undergraduates come to
him not knowing why they are
in college, much less what they
want to major in. Others
haven’t narrowed their goals
and want to major. in
everything.

For those who have no plans,
Cappeto can help them find a
major that can lead to many
types of employment or
graduate school.

Cappeto also offers career in-
terest tests to students, free of
charge. Privately ad-
ministered, they would cost the
student about $50, Cappeto said.

Although the tests do not dic-
tate what a student will do, they
do help focus his interests, mak-
ing it easier to choose a major.

Cappeto says that his office
does not try to override or
weaken the position of faculty
advisors, but tries to supple-
ment it. He adds that W&L’s ad-
visor system is ‘‘better than
most.”

Most of the students using the
service are seniors who need
help in job placement or
graduate school admission.

The office is not an employ-
ment agency and cannot get
jobs for students, but can help a
student find the job he wants.

One way the office helps a stu-
dent find work is through its job
referral service. Cappeto can
refer students to companies in
the field that might hire them.

Cappeto also keeps track of
alumni who might be able to
help a student in his search.
Usually the alumni are recent

2.8.82 6232.93 3242

344444464

graduates who can advise the
student about the job market,
Cappeto said.

The office also advises
students on how to efficiently
apply for jobs and conduct job
surveys. The office publishes a
guide to writing “‘cover letters”’
and resumes to helping students
with their applications.

To help students choose
graduate schools, the office
keeps directories that sum-
marize different graduate
schools, The directories are ar-
ranged by field, so Cappeto
would supply a list of the
schools of interest to the student
and a brief description of each.
The student can then choose to
write to those in his preferred
size-range or location.

After a student has found a
few graduate schools he is in-
terested in, Cappeto advises
him to talk to professors who at-
tended the schools to find out
more about them.

Alumni still contact the
career office for help in finding
work if they are unemployed or
switching jobs.

Cappeto urges students to
come by to talk to him about
their career plans. His office is
right on the way to the Cockpit,
so stop by one day and see what
he can do for you.

The Executive Committee:

by Randy Smith

There has been very little controversy
this year.

This has come as a disappointment to
some who remember what must have
seemed like an almost weekly barrage of
various sorts of scandals in these pages
last year.

By comparison, this has been a
‘‘dead,”’ almost boring year.

A lack of controversy can mean one of
two things: either scandalous activity is
taking place clandestinely, or everything
is running smoothly and efficiently.

This year’s Executive Committee, at
the pinnacle of Washington and Lee’s stu-
dent government and responsible for the
broad scope of the many activities affec-
ting the student body, is, perhaps, the
most thorough-going and efficient EC in
recent memory.

They have given careful consideration
to each important matter that has been
presented to them, deliberating the ad-
vantages and disadvantages of each side
of the issue. They have also initiated their
own study of different ideas and pro-
posals.

Last spring the Committee members
set down in guidelines what they ex-
pected of all their subcommittees, and
they have held those subcommittees
responsible and accountable to those
guidelines.

There has been a great amount of con-
sistency between the general ideas pro-
pounded last spring, when the Committee
was feeling its way, and the action taken
this fall, when the Committee was in
charge.

Yet, the EC has not been rigid in it
demands, allowing a certain degree of
flexibility.

 

eae RS,
sn Socdoaaial i NAAR

BEAU DUDLEY

The most significant factor in the way
the EC has conducted its business is the
serious attitude of its members. They all
take their job in student government as a
responsibility with which they have been
entrusted.

The pattern was set last spring when
. the newly elected Committee carefully
and methodically selected the persons to
fill the top positions on its subcommittees
— the persons the Committee would have

 

to work with all of this year.

Because of good leadership and strict
accounting standards, subcommittee
chairmen have not overstepped their
bounds and questionable practices have
not been in evidence.

 

 

 

There is no doubt that this year’s EC
has more control over the actions of its
subcommittees that past Committees,
largely due to its demand for monthly
reports and exact financial statements.

As a whole, the EC is conservative —
that is, it is composed of members who
are fiscally prudent and fundamentally
traditionalist.

Although all of its members are new to
student government except one, there is a
wealth of talent and experience on the
Committee, and, at least so far, the
representatives are hardworking and
concscientious.

 

eetccnonseneeee area an neue: ream,

TOM McCARTHY

 

oy : *

Early into the year, the Committee
reaffirmed last year’s ruling that all stu-
dent subcommittee meetings be open.

They went one step further than last
year’s EC and ruled that all meetings and
their agenda be posted ahead of time. But
the Committee stopped short, failing to
require that all committee votes be open,
thus allowing subcommittee chairmen to
close at least part of the democratic pro-
cess to the public.

The diligence of the EC was best ex-
emplified during the five-hour-long
budget meeting of Sept. 26, where $75,000
in student tax money was divided bet-
ween 10 subcommittees and campus
organizations.

The budget hearing produced surpris-
ingly little bloodshed and was generally
an orderly and reasonable process. When
the evening draw to a close, there was no
need to rejuggle the figures because the
totals balanced.

   

JOHN MURPHY

“T look very dimly on any group that
knows they will want money this year and
did not submit a budget to this committee
for consideration tonight,’’ said Beau
Dudley, EC president, on the night of the
budget hearings.

True to his words, the EC has only ap-
propriated $100 since that time, to the
recently formed Independents’ Union.

Carren Kaston’s Film Society was
denied money when it came before the
EC. The Society has approached the
Committee without first checking with
the Student Activities Board (SAB) or the
law school’s film group, both of which

show films on campus with EC funding.
The EC very politely (and correctly)
directed Ms. Kaston to the SAB, where
she found the funds to get her Film Socie-
ty started.

Other positive accomplishments of the
EC have been:

—the granting of some discretion to the
Cockpit managemen to book bands there,
and the decision to keep the Music Union
under the SAB’s financial control (and,
hence, within the EC’s jurisdiction),
thereby eliminating some of the tensions
and confusion that arose in last year’s
tug-of-war to control Cockpit entertain-
ment; this year everyone knows what his
responsibility is, and the result has been
a coordinated program of consistently
high-quality entertainment in W&L’s
tavern;

ROB CALVERT

—this week’s orientation of freshmen
about the Independent Examination
system and its application to the honor
code (see related article p. 2);

—and the recommendation for some
sort of grade-review process (see EC
story).

ROB BENFIELD

The EC had a rough time, though, with
the freshman elections in October.
' The inexperience of the Committee led
to some confusion about the rules for can-
didates, and some representatives called
for a new election after nine of the 17 can-
didates had been stricken from the ballot
for a failure to turn in financial
statements.

The controversy led the Committee to
re-examine all election regulations to
make sure that the implications were
resolved for the future.

Of particular interest was the debate
over allowing write-in candidates in the
run-off election. The EC swung from one
position to the other in the course of two
weeks.

For the freshman run-off election of
Oct. 19, no write-in candidates were

 

   
  

STEVE ABRAHAM

allowed to enter the race.

But that restriction was reversed on
Oct. 30 by a close 6-5 vote. The decision to
allow write-in candidates in future run-
off elections was upheld by a 7-4 margin
the following week.

Undoubtedly, the subject of write-in
candidates in run-off elections will again
be debated in the early spring.

Important to the success of the EC these
first three month: has been the organiza-
tion and performance of the “‘Big Three”’
(the president, vice-president, and
secretary).

_ DEE KEESLER

EC President Beau Dudley has been
the driving force of the committee.

The articulate, charismatic third-year
law student has had a tremendous in-
fluence over his fellow committee
members and is not shy about expressing
his own viewpoints.

But Dudley is not pretentious with his
opinions and will respectfully give his at-
tention to his colleagues on the commit-
tee.

His leadership has been a definite asset
tothe EC.

Bill Tucker, vice-president of the EC,
has been most effective in dealing with
the SAB, of which he is a former chair-
man.

 

WILL MACKIE

 

CHARLIE SCOTT

Very little gets by Tucker that he does
not notice. Although this is his first year
on the EC, his intimate knowledge of
other student committees and organiza-
tions has been a valuable asset to the
Committee as a whole.

Tom McCarthy is probably the most ef-
ficient and organized EC secretary in the
student government’s history.

He is the one who does the groundwork
for the Committee and makes sure
everything runs smoothly.

His dedication to his responsibilities
may never be matched again, and the EC
probably should consider hiring him as
secretary for life after he graduates.

 

BOB WILLIS

John Murphy, third-year law school
representative, is another whose _in-
fluence has been felt by the Committee as
a whole.

Murphy has made worthwhile contribu-
tions while not overshadowing the
undergraduate members of the EC.

During the budget hearings, he and
Dudley were probably harder on the Stu-
dent Bar Association’s budget requests
than the undergraduates.

Murphy’s common sense has lended a
balanced perspective to the EC.

  

JENELLE MIMS

Rob Calvert, senior representative, is
probably the conservative on a fairly con-
servative body.

Calvert consistently fights for the
established proceedure or group and
usually ends up on Dudley’s side. His in-
fluence has been particularly felt on mat-
ters involving the SAB (as he was a
member of the subcommittee last year).

Calvert, for example, led the fight to
keep the Music Union under the SAB’s
financial control arguing that the SAB
had been ‘carefully chosen so that it
would represent a consensus of the enter-
tainment opinions” on campus.

Rob Benfield, senior representative,
has not led any discussions, although he
does not hesitate to contribute. By and
large, he has sided with the majority opi-
nion

Benfield was a strong proponent of the

Georgetown Hoyas 27-25. The loss may seen insignificant, consider-
ing the Generals’ final record of 2-8, but it shows the improvement
that occurred at W&L in 1978. :

The architect of this new-found respectability is Coach Gary
Fallon who has completed his first season with W&L. Fallon took
over one of the school’s most unsuccessful teams and, while he did
not improve on the 1977 mark of 3-8, he did lay the groundwork for a
promising future. ‘“‘We started a lot of new players in this pro-

gram,” said the coach. ‘‘I am very excited about the future of both |

the players and the program.”’

Fallon’s ‘‘program’’ began in the most inauspicious way,
however. The Generals lost their first two games by a combined
score of 83-14, including pastings of 49-7 and 34-7. Poor play con-
tinued as the Generals lost their next three in a row to run their
record to 0-5. Fallon dismissed these games as ‘“‘the first part of a
two part season.”’ In the second season, W&L was 2-3, including
losses of 18-17 and 27-25. More importantly, the Generals had evolv-
ed into a team with a winning attitude.

In looking at this year’s team and next year’s returnees, there
are some interesting contrasts. This year’s strength was in the
defense and next year’s team will have some key positions to fill.

Gone will be linebacker Car] Folcik, ODAC Player of the Year.
Also graduating are All-ODAC safety Don Crossley and cornerback
Jack Norberg, the mainstays of the defensive backfield.

W&L will also lose defensive ends Tom Baynham and Greg Lilly.
Therefore, the 1979 team will be strong up the middle, with all in-
terior linemen returning, and weak on the outside with new defen-
sive ends and two new defensive backs.

On offense, W&L will be loaded. The entire backfield returns, in-
cluding quarterback Rich Hachenburg, fullback Jim Palermo and
tailback Stewart Atkinson, who sets a record every time he carries
the ball. The only problem is that he may have no where to run. The
entire right side of the line graduates this year, including
center Bob Burkholder, guard Jim Guynn and AIll-ODAC tackle
George Berry.

Also missing will be All-ODAC split end Richard Wiles.

Hachenburg’s favorite receiver, Chris Leiser, will be back, as
will tight end/punter Syd Farrar. The kicking game will be at its
strongest in years.

Joining Farrar are place kicker Randy Austin, who set a school
record with a 44 yard field goal against Georgetown, and kick-off

man Rich Cerone. With the advantage of six games at Wilson Field
next year, 1979 could be a winning year for W&L.

In his first year at W&L, Gary Fallon experienced most
everything a coach can. He suffered through a six-game losing
streak, enjoyed a two-game winning streak, and saw two games
slip away at the last moment. ‘The one thing I have learned this
year is patience,”’ said the coach. ‘‘Next year, I will use the same
approach as I did this year. I am very proud of what my players did
this year and I look for more success next year. Right now, I want
* them to get away from football.’’ Thus, football ends for 1978.

Generals lose 87-78

against Hampden-Sydney

by Bill Whalen

The Washington and Lee
Generals lost their first game of
the season to Hampden-Sydney,
87-78 last night at Warner
Center. The Generals who now
stand at 2-1 overalland 0-1 in
ODAC play, must regroup
before facing Averett on Friday
night

W&L started strongly against

the Tigers by scoring the first.

      
   

Tom Jeffries goes up for shot against Hampden-Sydney last night

eight points in the game. The
Generals held a 22-12 lead with
8:40 left in the first half. At this
point the W&L defense was
never better, as the closest
shotsH-SC could attempt
werel5-20 feet out. H-SC then
outscored the Generals 22-12 to
even it up at 34 all. The once im-
permeable defense was riddled
with easy layups, including
three backdoor passe

to Ed

Owens. W&L Coach Verne Can-
field cited these baskets as “‘the
result of having no help-side
play.”’ In other words, Owens
was not being picked up under
the basket. The teams traded
baskets and H-SC led at
halftime, 42-40.

The Tigers scored the first
eight points of the second half
To take a 50-40 lead. The
Generals trailed 54-48 with 14:35
left but H-SC refused to fold.
Hampden-Sydney went on a 14-6
scoring tear to up their lead to
66-54, a margin that was to
much to overcome. A Pete Far-
rell tip-in reduced the lead to
72-64 with 4:40 left, but but H-SC
went into the “four corners’’
delay and iced the game away
with clutch free-throw shooting
and a little luck.

Suprisingly, Canfield was not

too upset overthe loss. “‘They

outplayed us and we deserved
to lose, ‘‘said the coach. ‘‘We
played good ball for the first
eight minutes, but we slacked
off,’’ continued Canfield. The
coach did make some suprising
moves, however. One was star-
ting Ardith Collins and Rob
Smitherman in the same lineup.
‘“‘Ardith always plays well
against H-SC,”’ said Canfield,
‘tandI felt that he was readyto
have a big game.’’Collins
responded well, scoring 16
points.

Collins was the only starter to
do well. The rest of the starting
five - Tom Jeffries, Carby Hoy,
Mike Wenke, and Smitherman -
shot a combined 13 for 41 from
the field. The player that kept
the Generals in the game was
sub guard Farrell, who poured
in 24 points, making 11 of 17
shots. Farrell’s buckets were
mostly from the outside, and as
seen last night basketball
games are usually not won from
the outside.

Grapplers host tourney on Sat.

by Chris Sisto

The wrestling season began
November 18 as the Generals
participated in a takedown tour-
nament at James Madison
University. Co-captain Ed
Rogers (158) and Ray Gross
(142) finished second and com-
piled 2-1 overall records. Other
top General finishers were Tom
Oxendine (177), Dan Kniffen
(190) and Andy Gottschalk
(134), who all came in fourth.
This type of tournament is only
involved in stand-up wrestling
and there is no team score kept
so there is no overall winner. It
only, as Coach Gary Franke
describes, gives the wrestlers
experience for the upcoming
regular season matches.

The season was supposed to
begin for the Generals on
November 29 but the opener
against Lynchburg has been
postponed until Jan. 15. The
reason for the postponement is
due to a skin disease that the
Lynchburg players have. The
disease, Herpes Simplex, is an

% «

inflammation of the skin. About
eight of the Generals also have
the condition but they should be
ready for the Fifth Annual W&L
Invitational Tournament. This

tournament includes six teams
and runs all day Saturday,
December 2. Admission is free.
The Generals also host VMI on
December 6.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

End of

the term:
winding down

It never fails...Whenever a term draws to a close,
campus activity screeches to a standstill, as everyone
tries to catch up on the schoolwork which has been put
aside for months. Those brown manila envelopes —
the registrar’s own special ‘‘Christmas gift’’ — will be
flooding the campus in a few days. After that, ‘exam
panic” will be in full swing.

But there has been one notable activity in the midst
of this inertia. We would like to thank the E.C. for con-
tinuing their practice of a freshman “‘independent ex-
am orientation.” Over the years, many freshmen
have accidentally violated the honor system through
lack of understanding. Hopefully, the E.C.’s action
will keep these problems at a minimum.

Planning for the library move on January 10-con-
tinues at a fast pace. If all goes well, the campus
should be flooded with grain cups, good music, televi-
sion cameras and more. Watch for a Ring-tum Phi
“‘extra,’’ with final details and instructions, on the
first day of classes next term.

PRALINE IAS AS IN AS A EP

Ariel, W&L’s literary magazine, will make its first
appearance of the year within the next week. The up-
coming issue will feature color photography, and a
wide assortment of student fiction and poetry. This is
the first time in recent memory that student support
of Ariel has resulted in publication of an issue before
Christman, an encouraging sign. Congratulations to
Ben Keesee and staff for their efforts...

With this issue, the Ring-tum Phi ends publication
for the fall term. On the basis of this fall’s issues, we
can point to a growth rate of 35-40% over last year —
and an increase in pages of over 100% since The
News-Gazette assumed printing responsibilities in
May, 1977. Hopefully this increased space has allowed
the newspaper to print more varied and detailed
stories than ever before. Even so, if we have enjoyed
any measure of success this year, it is primarily due
to the many individuals on campus who have offered
their time, suggestions, and support. On behalf of the
entire staff, I give you our sincere thanks.

Survive those exams — and an enjoyable holiday
season to all...

W&L, Dartmouth fraternities compared ©

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

I want to correct several misconceptions about
the fraternity system at Dartmouth and
discourage too many comparisons between the
system as it exists here and the system in
Hanover. I wish the system there were our
model, for I feel it operates in a fashion which is
much more compatible with a liberal arts educa-
tion than it does here in Lexington. I graduated
from Dartmouth in 1961 and was an active frater-
nity member.

Several features distinguish the fraternity
system at Dartmouth from that of Washington
and Lee. 1. At Dartmouth, freshmen do not join a
fraternity until the beginning of the spring
quarter, i.e., mid-April of the freshman year.
The bulk of the freshman year is for acclimitaza-
tion, and for academics. Fraternity life takes the
proper back seat. 2. No fraternity at Dartmouth
is allowed to maintain a dining room. Students
eat in the College Dining Hall or in restaurants.
The fraternity is regarded as just one aspect in
the fabric of social life at Dartmouth. This rule
discourages fraternity members from total im-
mersion within a miniature society of ‘‘like-
thinking brothers’’ and forces them to maintain
contact with, and an allegiance to, the larger col-
lege community. 3. In 1960, every college frater-
nity officer at Dartmouth signed a pledge stating
that no written or unwritten clauses existed
within each fraternity’s charter preventing
membership of anyone on the basis of race,

creed, or color. No fraternity at Darmouth
tolerates the stupidty of the blackball whereby
one or two individuals can impose their bigotry
or ignorance on 60 other people. Fraternity
members have told me that such is not the case
here in Lexington. I find that hard to believe and
difficult to accept. 4. At Dartmouth, the most ac-
tive fraternity members are seniors. They live in
the fraternity and hold the major offices. This is
essentially a self-imposed regulation. I think it
produces more mature leadership within in-
dividual fraternities. 5. The fraternities in
Hanover are subject to the same rules and
regulations as the other members of the com-
munity. No special ‘‘dispensations” are either
given or asked for. The College makes no at-
tempt to provide buffers between the fraternity
system and the ‘‘town fathers.”

I hope these facts make it clear that the Dart-
mouth fraternity system operates in quite a dif-
ferent fashion that the fraternity system here.
Quite frankly I feel that the role of the frater-
nities at Dartmouth and the various philosophies
underlying the system there are much more in
harmony with the other institutions and aims
within an undergraduate, liberal arts educa-
tional institution. I think there there is a place for
fraternities here, but I think it is important to
constantly evaluate their role in what is first and
foremost an academic community.

E.C. exam rules

ToAll Upperclassmen :

The Executive Committee would like to take
this opportunity to remind you of your respon-
sibilities during the exam period. Independent
exams are a tremendous convenience to the en-
tire community, and the Student Body must offer
its cooperation to ensure their continuation.

Last year the faculty adopted a new politicy
concerning examination procedures. The rule

reads as follows:

‘“‘A student should not expect to have his ex-
amination graded if it is turned in late, turned in

without the examination questions, or if he takes
the examination in other than the assigned

room.”

This rule will clear up much of the past confu-
sion regarding the implementation of exams.

Sincerely,

Dr. Turner
publishes

book of Civil
War letters

The Civil War letters of a pro-
minent Lexington resident and
Washington and Lee University
official, Col. J. K. Edmondson,
have been collected and edited
by Dr. Charles W. Turner in a
volume newly published by Mc-
Clure Press.

The book is entitled “‘My Dear
Emma’: War Letters of James
K. Edmondson, 1861-65,”’ and is
the sixth in a_= series of
Rockbridge histories Dr.
Turner has written or edited in
recent years. ‘‘Emma’’ was his
wife, the former Emily Taylor
of Staunton, whom he married
in 1856 and to whom he wrote
the letters Dr. Turner has col-
lected and edited.

Edmondson joined the
Rockbridge Rifles at the begin-
ning of the war, later the
Stonewall Brigade, and his let-
ters offer a vivid picture of
military supply problems,
camp life, and the typical of-
ficer’s anxieties, hopes and ex-
pectations from the ‘home
front.”

Born near Buena Vista, Ed-
mondson was a graduate of
Washington College and at the
time of the outbreak of the Civil
War was judge of Circuit Court
in Staunton. After the war, he
was elected mayor of Lexington
and judge of the court here.

In 1865, when the war ended,
he became treasurer of
Washington College and held
that position until 1868. Two
years later he became
secretary of the board of
trustees of Washington and Lee
University, as the college was
renamed in that year. He oc-
cupied that latter position for 28
years.

Judge Edmondson’ was
elected Rockbridge’s delegate
to the Virginia General
Assembly in 1893-94. He owned
two of Lexington’s most notable
homes, the Penick-Edmondson
House on White Street, which he
- built, and.Silverwood on South
Main Street, which he purchas-
ed.

The 139 letters which Dr.
Turner used in preparing the
volume are in the archives of
the Rockbridge Historical
Society in McCormick Library
on the W&L campus. The book
also contains’ several
photographs.

Dr. Turner, professor of
American history at W&L, join-
ed the university faculty in 1946,
the year he received his Ph.D.
degree from the University of
Minnesota.

The Executive Committee of the Student Body is concerned over
the existing situation regarding grading, specifically:

A) Students have no appelate process in which to protest their
grades;

B) A student's final evaluation might be based upon work which he
has never seen (e.g. final exams) :

C) Students are sometimes unaware of what weight will be given
each assignment or test in the computation of the final grade.

With these thoughts in mind, the Executive Committee recom-
mends that the Faculty adopt the following guidelines:

I) Students have the right to question any professor concerning a
grade he has received. Any student feeling that he has been unjust-
ly treated has the right to bring the matter to the attention of the
Department Head. The Department Head shall then review the
grade in question with the professor involved.

II) Students have the right to view and discuss all graded material
and any factor entering into the final grade within a reasonable
time after receipt of any grade. Professors shall keep final ex-
aminations for a period of one month into the semester following
examination.

III) At the beginning of the term, the professor should provide a
course syllabus which includes, among other things, a general
schedule of expected assignments and an approximate percentage
analysis of the final grade.

 

Cold Check Committee,
reported that $107.76 of the
$331.20 in debts outstanding to
students who have left the
University had been recovered
since his last report to the EC
one month ago.

Schoenfeld said that the $107
sum represented one person,
and that $223.44 is still outstan-
ding to persons who are no
longer students at W&L.

The Cold Check Committee is
holding $45.43 in bad checks of
current students.

The Student Activities Board
reported that its ski trip to
Snowshoe has attracted only

five students so far. Efforts are
being made to entice females
from the surrounding women’s
colleges to sign up.

position that write-in candidates should
be allowed in run-off elections ‘‘to give
the voters a fair choice.”

Steve Abraham, junior representative,
is the only returning veteran of last
year’s EC.
He has consistently been the strong ad-
vocate of open meetings, and is not shy
about pointing out the Committee’s faults
and weakenesses.
He is noted for his fairness and does not
hesitate to express the minority view.
Abraham was the member who thought
the freshman elections should be done
over, and he has consistently opposed
allowing write-in candidates in run-off
elections.

Dee Keesler, junior rep., has been a
quiet member of the EC and often sides
with the majority.

He was the representative who sug-
gested the freshman orientation about In-
dependent Exams this year.

Will Mackie, sophomore represen-
tative, sits on the right side of the table
with Calvert and Benfield.

He often sides with the majority and, in
ithat regard, upholds what has already

 

EC assessment

been established.

Mackie was instrumental in helping
defeat Abraham’s proposal that the
freshman election be held again by say-
ing that a candidate’s ‘‘responsibility”’ is
to know the rules of the election.

The soft-spoken Bob Willis, sophomore
rep., is probably the most impressive
member of this year’s EC.

He has established himself as the
representative of the independents and
one who is willing to fight the cause for
culture (he was alone in his support of
Kaston’s Film Society).

Willis is a strong supporter of all new
organizations and also led a subcom-
mittee which investigated the possibility
of establishing a grade-review pro-
ceedure at W&L.

His contributions to the Committee
have been significant and he will be a
member to watch in the future.

Jenelle Mims, the first year law school
representative, and Charlie Scott,
freshman rep., have not held office long
enough for a fair assessment to be made
about them. However, both seen to be
more comfortable and relaxed in the EC
room.

In Memoriam

Mrs. Elizabeth
Royall Huntley

Mrs. Elizabeth Royall
Huntley, mother of Washington
and Lee University President
Robert E.R. Huntley, died Sun-
day, November 19, in Winston-
Salem, N.C., where she had liv-
ed for many years.

 

Mrs. Huntley was the widow
of B.F. Huntley. In addition to
her son Robert of Lexington,
she is survived by another son,
Dr. Benjamin F.. Huntley Jr., a
physician in Winston-Salem,

and by six grandchildren.
She was born in the town of
Wake Forest, N.C.,_ the

daughter of the late Mr. and
Mrs. Robert Edward Royall.
Her family had been connected
with Wake Forest University,
then located in that town, for
several generations. Wake
Forest moved to Winston-Salem
in 1956. Her grandfather taught
at Wake Forest for more than 40
years, beginning prior to the
Civil War, and her uncle taught
there for 53 years. Her father
was an alumnus and lifetime
trustee of that university.

It was through her and her
husband’s friendship with the
late Francis Pendleton Gaines,
president of Wake Forest in the
1920s, that the Huntley family
eventually became associated

with Washington and Lee. In
1930 Dr. Gaines left Wake
Forest to become president of

years. The Huntleys maintain-
ed their close friendship with
Dr. and Mrs. Gaines throughout
that time, and when the two

LSAT scores drop

Due to a change in the make-
up in the Law School Admission
Test (LSAT), colleges across
the country are reporting
drastic decreases in scores —
an occurrence which may play
havoc with the admissions pro-
cess in the nation’s law schools.
This information was recently
released by Mike Cappeto,
Assistant Dean of Students and
Director of Career Placement
at W&L.

According to Cappeto, the
Educational Testing Service,
which prepares the LSAT, ‘‘fine
tunes’’ it every year, attemp-
ting to make it discriminate
among candidates more ac-
curately. Last year, they in-
advertantly added too many
questions which led to high
scores. Cappeto commented,
“Last year, there were too
meny scores over 750 that didn’t
belong there. University of
Chicago noticed this first,
reporting 12 times more perfect
scores of 800 than ever before.”

This year, at the insistence of
the Law School Admissions
Council, the ETS refined the
test again — just before the Oc-
tober, 1978 administration. Un-
fortunately for law applicants,
they ‘‘overcompensated’’ for
the original error. And as a
result, scores have entered a
drastic tailspin.

At W&L, last year’s scores
averaged 595; this year they
plummeted to 525. A concerned
Mike Cappeto began to

telephone other colleges in the
area, and discovered similar
dismay. William & Mary
reports score averages down 82
points; VPI is down 90 points
according to local officials; and
though University of Virginia
declined to give a_ specific
number figure, they described
their score drop as “‘alarming.”’

ETS refuses to comment on
these events, and won’t release
nationwide figures until
January or later. So, the pro-
blem becomes obvious. As Cap-
peto states, ‘‘applicants will be
basing their choices of law
schools upon last year’s inflated
LSAT standards, selecting
themselves out of schools in
which they may have a very
good chance of admission.”

To add more fuel to the fire,
law schools appear to be totally
uninformed of this change in the
LSAT. W&L law officials were
unaware of any change when in-
formed by Cappeto. He com-
mented, ‘Somebody — should
take it upon themselves to in-
form the various law
schools...If not, they’re going to
be waiting for high-score ap-
plicants who may never come
in.”

Even so the magnitude of the
LSAT ‘“‘score drop” is_ not
known. As a result, Cappeto
urges students to apply to law
schools assuming that there is
no major discrepancy. Then, as
he says, ‘‘take a few long-shots
in your applications, just in
case.”’

Library Move Great Success

1,600 participate in transferring books to new library

A larger than expected
worker turnout helped speed
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s library move yesterday
beyond all preliminary expecta-
tions.

Over 1,100 students, faculty,
alumni, and townspeople had
registered by 9:45 a.m. to move
books from McCormick Library
to W&L’s new library. Susan
Coblentz, in charge of the
registration, estimated that in
all, between 1,500 - 1,600 persons
participated in the.effort which
saw 150,000 volumns moved in
just two and one half hours.

Maurice Leach, head of the
University’s library, called the
book moving © operation
‘‘super,’’ which he defined as
‘‘extraordinaily great’’ and
‘beyond all expectations. ”’

Originally, the Library Move
Committee had estimated that
the move would require 1,000
persons to each carry 18 bags of
books before the transfer from
the old library tothe new one
could be completed. The Com-
mittee had planned for the
move to take seven hours.

‘*We are finished here now”’

But the word was given by
library reference head Betty
Kondayan at 10:50 a.m. that
‘‘everything’s finished.”

‘‘We are finished here now,”
she told the book carriers in the
lobby of McCormick Library.

‘‘There are no more books.”’
Still, eager book porters
crowded the small stack
stairwell and asked if there
were more books they could
carry.

Organization and efficiency

Leach cited a number of fac-

  

“egg: a a ae Toor

tors that contributed to the suc-
cess of the book moving opera-
tion:

—the over 125 people who were
‘“‘behind the scenes’’ directing
the book carriers where to go
every step of the way;

~ —the 320 freshmen and 30 dor-

mitory counselors who were

 

 

briefed the night before on the
procedure so that they could
start right in at 8:30a.m.;

—the Library Move Committee
as a whole;

—the staff of W&L’s law
library, the Marshall Library,
and the Virginia Military In-
stitute’s library who, with their

.*
%

 

expertise, helped make the
transfer of books a smooth
operation.

In particular, Leach named
Steve Mangan, student chair-
man of the Library Move Com-
mittee, Bean Dudley, president
of W&L’s student body, Gray
Coleman, editor of the Ring-
tum Phi,Bob Keefe, director of
W&L’s news office, George
Barr, move consultant, Scott
Beebe, building engineer, and
Jim Arthur for their work in
organizing the book moving
operation.

Leach had special priase for
Margaret Williams, who spent
months working out the
logistics of the move itself.

Williams counted the books,
oversaw their division into sec-
tions, and mapped out the
routes the book carriers would
follow in the transfer operation.

‘She was unbelievable,”’ said
Bean Dudley. “‘She’s entirely
responsible for the efficiency of
the operation.”

‘It makes me sort of happy
that it only took two hours,”
said Miss Williams, ‘‘because it
shows that at least it was well
planned.”

“IT can’t really decide if I'm
surprised or not,” said Dudley,
about the quickness with which
the move was completed. ‘‘It’s
remarkable, but we expect that
ata place like W&L.”

EC Extends Datz’s

by Randy Smith

The Executive Committee
Monday night extended the
authority of Burr Datz, assis-
tant manager of W&L’s food
services, to charge an entrance
fee to pay bands performing in
the Cockpit.

The EC’s action, which came
without a vote, continues the
Cockpit cover charge policy
established in September.

“I think it (the cover charge)
worked to the students’ ad-
vantage by making up the dif-
ference between student funds
and band fees,”’ Datz told the
committee.

He said that the Cockpit had
had six cover charges last
semester, one of them benefit-
ting the United Way.

Datz also praised the work of
the University Center Commit-
tee saying that the group ‘thas
been tremendous, really
tremendous.”

“The student body is getting
the best of this situation,’ he
added.

Bill Tucker, EC vice-
president, asked Datz about the
possibility of obtaining a new
sound system for the Cockpit.

“We can get a_ top-notch
sound system for about $1,500,”
Datz said. The system Datz had
in mind would include a six
channel mixer, speakers,
cables, an equalizer, and would
be mobile for use anywhere on
campus.

The only problem was the

...discusses Contact
before Christmas

At the Executive Committee
meeting before Christmas
break, questions were raised
about the process used in the
selection of the fraternities to
host a reception for Contact
speakers.

The questions arose when
Tom Wall, chairman of Contact,
reported that this year’s first
speaker, former Sen. James
Buckley would have a reception
before his speech at the Phi
Kappa Sigma house.

Steve Abraham, sophomore

EC representative and a
member of the IFC, said that
the selection of the Phi Kap
house for the reception was the
first he had heard of the matter.

Wall told the committee that
the IFC had ‘‘picked a house
that hadn’t had a speaker in the
past year,” and that was all he
knew about the selection.

Wall also reported that
Buckley would cost $3,000,
which would be split equally
with the Mock Convention Com-
mittee.

McDaniel Chairs
Historical Archaeology
Session

John M. McDaniel, assistant
professor of anthropology at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, was chairman of a session on
academic sites in North
America last week at the 12th
annual conference of the Socie-
ty for Historical Archaeology in
Nashville, Tenn.

This was the first year that
academic sites have received
the recognition provided by a
special session at the annual
meeting, McDaniel said.

. McDaniel, who credits the
work undertaken since 1974 at
W&L’s Liberty Hall dig for the
new attention on academic
sites, also delivered a paper,
“The Future: Opportunities,
Challenges and Problems of the
Academic Site Orientation,”
during the conference.

Also speaking at the session
on academic sites were two
Washington and Lee graduates
and a current W&L student.
Their papers dealt with the
analysis of data from the work
at the Liberty Hall excavation.

Parker B. Potter Jr., a senior
from Bexley, Ohio, delivered a

paper, ‘General Cultural In-
sights from the Academic Site;
or, You Can Learn More Than
the Layout of the Campus.”’

Kurt C. Russ, a 1978 graduate
from Buena Vista, spoke on
“The Case for the Application of
Archaeological Techniques
When Extensive Documentary
Evidence exists.”’

And Charles L. Hall, a 1978
graduate from Arlington, read
the opening paper, “The Liber-
ty Hall Academy Site.”

$1,500 price tag, which Tucker
hinted might be paid out of EC
funding.

Also at Monday’s meeting,
sophomore representative
Steve Abraham asked that the
EC investigate the process by
which fraternities are chosen
for Contact speaker receptions.

He said that there was some
discrepency in the way the Phi
Kappa Sigma house was chosen
to host the reception for former
Sen. James Buckley in
December.

“‘T just want to know how it’s
done,” Abraham said.

The Student Activities Board
reported that they foresee no
financial problems in the
future. Winter Weekend is being
planned for Feb. 3.

 

 

 

Ann Smith
Renovation

Plans:

Architects representing Chi
Psi fraternity will begin their
preliminary inspection of the
old Ann Smith School early this
year with an eye toward prepar-
ing detailed renovation plans.

W&L bought the abandoned
school building from the city for
$130,000 in a sale completed
Dec. 8. The university will lease
the facility to Chi Psi, which is
forming a chapter at
Washington and Lee.

Chi Psi will undertake a com-
plete interior renovation of the
structure. Washington and Lee
will maintain the grounds and
the exterior appearance and
has already begun stepping up
security at the building and tak-
ing other measures such as
boarding it up to prevent fur-
ther physical deterioration.

When the renovation begins,
W&L and Chi Psi will maintain
the historic building’s exterior
appearance to the maximum
extent possible, according to
university officials. Because
the building is in Lexington’s
historic district, changes in the
facade would have to be approv-
ed by the city Planning Com-
mission, but preliminary W&L-
Chi Psi plans call for such
changes, if there are any at all,
to be minor.

No specific timetable has
been set for the renovation.

EC to investigate
Cover Charge Power | Buckley reception

by David Greer

The Executive Committee
will investigate possible im-
proprieties in the choosing of
the reception for Contact
speaker James Buckley last
November.

Receptions for Contact
speakers are supposed to be
held at fraternities chosen by
random drawing. But for
Buckley’s reception, Phi Kappa
Sigma was chosen by a decision
made by Contact chairman
Tom Wall and IFC president
Jim Davis.

According to Wall, Pi Kappa
Alpha was originally chosen in
a random drawing. However,
members of Contact and the
IFC realized that PiKA had the
last speaker last year and
decided that it would be more
fair to allow other fraternities
to have a chance to host recep-
tions.

IFC member Syd Farrar sug-
gested removing from the list of

eligable fraternities those who

have hosted receptions in the
past year.

Wall, Farrar, and Davis met
to discuss a re-drawing on the
Monday before Buckley’s
Wednesday night speech. Ac-
cording to Wall, they realized
that they did not have enough
time to chose another fraternity
and be sure that it was able to
host a reception.

Davis said that his house, Phi

for the rest of the receptions.

Kappa Sigma, would be able to
have the reception, and Davis
and Wall decided to have it
there, Wall said.

Davis then announced at the
next IFC meeting (after the
speech) that the Phi Kap house
had been chosen in a random
drawing.

(Wall told the Executive
Committee that the IFC had
made the selection of the frater-
nity hosting the reception. )

Farrar told Wall and Davis
that he felt that Red Square had
been having too many of the
receptions and that there should
be random drawings from
among the houses that had not
recently had speakers. He add-
ed that Phi Delta Theta had not
had a speaker for the past five
years but that Phi Kap had had
them recently.

Wall said that he thought that
Phi Kap had not had a reception
in the three years he has been
working with Contact.

Wall also said that the loca-
tions for the rest of the recep-
tions this year have been picked
at random, and that Sigma Phi
Epsilon and Zeta Beta Tau are
to be the hosts for the next two
speakers.

Wall said that he realized
Contact and the IFC had had
trouble with the selection for
the Buckley reception, but that
the “problem has been rec-
tified’ by a new proper drawing

Leyburn to speak at ODK—

Founder’s Day convocation

Honorary ODK initiates named

Dr. James Graham Leyburn,
former professor of sociology,
anthropology and ancient
history at Washington and Lee
University and dean of The Col-
lege from 1947 to 1955, will be
the principal speaker at W&L
Founders’ Day ceremonies next
Friday, Jan. 19.

By custom, ‘‘tapping’’

ceremonies for Omicron Delta
Kappa, the national 'eadership
society founded 65 years ago at
Washington and Lee, will take
place during the Founders’ Day
convocation.

 

This year, two prominent
alumni, a Lexington resident,
and a number of current

undergraduates and law
students will be ‘‘tapped’’ into
ODK membership.

The honorary initiates are
Robert A. Fulwiler Jr. of Wilm-
ington, Del., assistant general
counsel for Hercules Powder
Co. in Radford, Va.; Fred O.
Funkhouser of Harrisonburg,
Va., chairman of the board of
United Virginia Bank in
Spotswood; and J. Sanford
Doughty of Lexington, retired
associate director of develop-
ment at Washington and Lee.

The public is invited to attend
the events, which begin at 12:30
p.m. in Evans Hall.

Dr. Leyburn is the noted

social historian whose major
books include “The Haitian
People,’’ winner of the
Anisfield-Wolf Award when it
was first published in 1941 by
Yale University Press, which
re-issued it in 1966, and ‘The
Scotch-Irish,” published in 1962.

He came to W&L after a 20-
year career on the sociology
faculty at Yale. The so-called
“Leyburn Plan” for revising
the W&L curriculum, which he
proposed almost at the beginn-
ing of his tenure as dean, “‘in
large measure formed the
subsequent academic history of
Washington and Lee,’’ Presi-

dent Robert E. R. Huntley com-

mented when Dr. Leyburn

“ retired from teaching in 1972.

Dr. Leyburn is a graduate of
Duke and Princeton Univer-
sities, with degrees in
economics, and of Yale, where
he received his Ph.D. in
sociology. He also holds
honorary doctorates from Duke
and Washington and Lee.

His Founders’ Day address
will be on the subject of ‘“‘ex-
cellence, noblesse oblige (or the
Miltonian concept. of
‘magnanimity’), and _ the
Roman notion of ‘genius loci,’
or ‘genius of place’,” Dr.
Leyburn says.

“In a community such as
Washington and Lee,”’ he says,
“those concepts describe, or

ought to describe, ideals -the
demands imposed upon both in-
dividuals and the place.”

ROBERT A. FULWILER is a
1925 B.A. graduate of W&L. He
earned his law degree from
Harvard Law School and has
been associated with Hercules
Powder Company in Radford,
Va., as assistant general
counsel since 1966.

FRED 0. FUNKHOUSER is a
1934 W&L alumnus. He has been
associated with the United
Virginia Bank in Spotswood
since 1953 and is currently
chairman of the board. He is a
past president of the Virginia
Industrial Bankers Association,
a past president of the Stuart
Hall Foundation in Staunton,
Va., and a former member
from the Seventh Congressional
District on the Governor’s Ad-
visory Council on Educational
Television.

J. SANFORD DOUGHTY is
the former associate director of
development at W&L. Prior to
assuming his position at W&L in
1970, Doughty headed Lake
Forest (Ill.) College’s develop-
ment program for five years.
He had also worked as manager
of advertising and public rela-
tions for Container Corporation
of America in Chicago. Doughty
received his bachelor’s degree
from Williams College and his
master’s degree from the Har-
vard Business School.

Junkin painting, sculpture exhibited

A memorial exhibition trac-
ing more than four decades of
painting and sculpture by the
late Marion M. Junkin is cur-
rently on display in W&L’s du-
Pont Gallery.

Junkin, who died June 18,
1977, was the founder in 1949 of
Washington and Lee’s fine arts
department and taught studio
art and art history courses at
W&L until his retirement in
1973. He was head of the art
department until 1968.

He had also founded the art
department at Vanderbilt
University in Nashville, and
taught there for eight years
prior to returning to Lexington
and Washington and Lee. He
was a 1927 graduate of W&L and
was a descendant of Dr. George
Junkin, Robert E. Lee’s im-
mediate predecessor as presi-
dent of Washington College.

On view in the gallery will be
42 works of art or series of
works by Junkin, beginning
with finely detailed etchings of
Washington and Lee campus
scenes which were published in
the college annual in the year of
his graduation through his late-
period watercolors, the last of
which he painted in 1970.

Included in the exhibition are
17 watercolors, 13 oil paintings,
a set of five sketchbooks, three
woodcuts, three etchings, two
lithographs, and_ three

sculptures, two in wood and one
of bronze.

Junkin was also noted for his
fresco murals, which will be
represented during an exhibi-
tion ceremony Jan. 12 when a

memorial exhibition,

15-minute film about his career
will be shown. The film was
made almost 20 years ago by O.
W. Riegel, then head of W&L’s
journalism department. The
ceremony will take place at 8
p.m. in duPont Auditorium, ad-
jacent to the gallery, and will be
preceded by a reception at 7
p.m. in the nearby Alumni
House. The public is invited to
both events.

A 32-page illustrated
catalogue of the exhibition is be-
ing published by Washington
and Lee.

Organizer of the exhibition
and principal author of the
catalogue is Dr. Pamela
Hemenway Simpson, assistant
professor of art history at
Washington and Lee. This
year’s is the fourth in a series of
winter exhibitions she has

 

mounted annually to mark im-
portant W&L and Lexington art
resources.

Nineteen of the Junkin works °
in the exhibition are reproduced
in black-and-white in the
catalogue, and the cover shows
a 1963 watercolor of a harbor
scene in full color. The
catalogue also contains a

Under the big top with

 

Superman

by Dick Barron

Anyone who has seen the film
pages of a recent newspaper
will notice the growing amount
of ads for new releases. The Big
Producers are out to get the big
money. They seem to believe
that the public loves a re-make,
a re-hash, or a re-release. This
kind of thinking brought you
The Wiz, The Invasion of the
Body Snatchers and Pinocchio.

The Lord of the Rings and.

 

Superman brought highly
popular and familiar subjects to
the screen while California
Suite merely translated a
popular Neil Simon play into
movie form. Popularity is the
name of the game, and the
results of this money mentality
can often be appealing,
although not always innovative.

They could have called it
anything — ‘Disasters Meet the
Sunday Comix”’ or the ‘‘Ringl-
ing Brothers Make a Movie” —
but they called it Superman. By
now, it’s no secret that Super-
man has become a blockbuster.
It brings in the cash by the
truckload, despite the early
warnings of “too much hype’’.
The special effects are truly im-
pressive. Gone are the days
when George Reeves flew
across our T,V. screens backed
with windy sound effects. Today
we have Chris Reeve, the
newcomer, flying with cables
and boom cranes, special matte
photography and animation —
it’s Star Wars technology on the
streets of Metropolis.

Somewhere, buried under this
circus is a movie — a film, com-
plete with a plot — Superman
grows up, works for the Daily
Planet, and fights crime. The
plot stays buried most of the
time, keeping well away from
the thrills and action.

Marlon Brando, the 3.7
million dollar actor, who por-
trays Superman’s dad is neither
good nor bad — he applies his
competence to his average part.
The same goes for Gene
Hackman, who must have wat-
ched a lot of old Batman
episodes for tips on being a
whimsical crook. Margot Kid-
der as Lois Lane is cute, and
Valerie Perrine is seductive,
while Jackie Cooper is the gruff
Perry White — they all are sim-
ple charicatures in simple
parts. Chris Reeve is excellent,
giving depth to a character
which could have been as flat as
a comic book.

Japanese films,

drama

A public performance and a
series of films on the theatre of
Japan will be given in conjunc-
tion with the visit to the
Washington and Lee University
campus this next week by Prof.
Akira Matsui, a professional
Japanese actor and instructor
in theatre.

Matsui, founder of the
Wakayama Nogaku Kanshokai,
a school in Japan for training
performers in the convention of
classic Japanese acting, will
visit W&L through the
cooperative efforts of the W&L
Asian Studies Committee, the
W&L drama division, and the
Glasgow Endowment program,
established in 1960 to promote
“the art of expression by pen
and tongue.”’

While at Washington and Lee,

Matsui will conduct a five-day
workshop in Noh drama, the
classical theatre form of Japan,
for W&L students and faculty
members beginning Monday,
Jan. 15.

A four-film series, depicting
the different aspects of and
-developments in Japanese
theatre open to the public
without charge, will begin
Wednesday, Jan. 17, with two
films, “Noh Drama’’ and “‘St.
Francis: A Noh Play,” at 7:30
p.m. in duPont Auditorium. The
films will run 90 minutes.

The last two films, “‘Kubuki’”’
and “Bunraku,”’ will be shown

the corner of North Main and
Henry Streets. Again, there will
be no charge for admission.

Matsui began taking lessons
in Noh theatre in 1951 when he
was five years old. He made his
debut one year later, continued
his studies for another 10 years,
and regularly appeared in pro-
ductions in many of Japan’s
theatres. In 1960 he performed
at the Tokyo Olympics and the
International Trade Fair, and
for the National Broadcast Cor-
poration on radio and televi-
sion.

In 1962, Matsui began
teaching Noh in Wakayama Ci-
ty, his home town, where he
later founded a school for train-
ing performers in the conven-
tion of classic Japanese acting.
Today, he also maintains a
school in Tokyo.

Matsui participated in a
cultural exchange trip in 1972 to

‘Vancouver, Canada, Richmond,

Va., and Bakersfield, Calif.,
and has since conducted
workshops at San Francisco
State University, the University
of Hawaii, Boston University
and Amherst College.

by Mark Mainwaring

While flipping through the
most recent issue of Walrus, a
trade paper devoted entirely to
album-oriented FM radio, I
came across a feature which
the folks there called their ‘‘An-
nual Crow-Eating for
Christmas” program. What it
consisted of was more or less an
examination of all the reviews
they had published in the past
year and an explanation of any
errors in critical judgement
they felt they had made. All of a
suddent, my mind was filled
with questions concerning the
nature of rock criticism itself,
and after a period of suitably in-
tense reflection I came to what
may seem to be a painfully ob-
vious conclusion; errors in
judgment are an unfortunate,
but in many ways unavoidable,
result of the entire critical pro-
cess. The pressures. of
deadlines, occassional attacks
of tin-earedness, and the in-
herently elusive nature of some
of the greatest rock’n’roll are
just a few of the factors that
contribute to this problem.
About this time I began to feel
concerned — what if we at
Musical Mainstream had made
some of the same kind of
mistakes?? I immediately dove
into my closet and after a brief
rummage came up with all the
issues of the Phi in which our
column had appeared. Was it
possible that all our conscien-
tious effort had been negated by
some inherent flaws in the form
itself??

Well, as it turned out, things
weren’t nearly as bad as I ex-
pected they might be. In
general, it appears that most of
what was written has
weathered the test of time in the
sense that what sounded great
in May still sounds great today,
and what struck me as pure
trash in October still has the
same effect. However, there
was one major exception, that
being our most recent, ‘‘year’s-
end’’ column. Neglecting
Jackson Brown’s pioneering
Running on Empty was pro-

bably our our most serious
omission — it was without a
doubt one of the most inventive
and successful concept albums
in recent memory.

Another flaw showed up as a
natural result of being forced to
sum up an entire year’s musical
experience with ten albums.
This restriction necessitated
the omission of such important
releases as Carlene Carter’s
debut album, Mik DeVille’s
Return to Magenta, Patti
Smith’s Easter and, worst of
all, Southside Johnny’s Hearts
of Stone and the two ground-
breaking albums by George
Thorogood and the Destroyers.
These records, in addition to the
ten originally chosen, make
1978 seem much more promis-

ing than it did at year’s end.
Paul Williams (the writer, not
the short songwriter) once said
that no negative critical judge-
ment should be taken seriously.
While I don’t necessarily agree
with this, it is true that most
critics tned to err on the over-
critical side. This tendency was
strong enough in my case to foul
my evaluation of an entire year,
not to mention countless in-
dividual cases that never made
it into print. The crucial point is
that rock criticism should be
viewed as an art form in itself,
with just as many ups and
.?2wns and inconsistencies as
£ .e music itself. Looked at from

Library Move

(continued from page 1)
Months in the planning

Planning for ‘the move”
began last January, when
George Barr was hired as a con-
sultant to advise the Library
Move Committee on the dif-
ferent procedures that could be
used to transfer the books. The
decision to have a day-long book
move utilizing students and
other volunteer laborers was
made last spring.

“If this move had been car-
ried out by a professional mov-
ing company, the estimated
cost would be somewhere in the
neighborhood of more than
$60,000," Leach said. ‘‘The
move, at the moment, is
nowhere near that sum of
money.”

A feeling of building the library

Another reason for the
volunteer book carrier ap-
proach to transferring the
books, according to Leach, was
“to create a feeling for the
people—meaning the students,
the faculty, and the people in
the community who use the
library—that they have had a
part in building the new
library.”

As an added incentive,
students were given the day off
from classes so that they would
participate in he move, and a
party was scheduled for
Wednesday night featuring two

bands and 40 kegs of beer, with,
a ticket demonstrating par-
ticipation in the library move as
the entrance fee.

Problems

The only complications Leach
saw in the otherwise flawless
book moving operation were the
congestion problems at the en-
trances and exits to both library
buildings, and the problem of
picking up the 4,000 paper bags
which littered the campus when
‘‘the move’’ was completed.

Lunch also did not run as
smoothly as the organizers had
hoped.

Many people apparently took
advantage of the four areas ser-
ving lunch on four different
floors, even though each worker
was supposed to only have one
roast beef sandwich.

“You'd be surprised how
many people eat on one floor
and run to the next one so they
can get two sandwiches,” said
Burr Datz, assistant manager
of W&L’s food services.

There was also a problem
with trash on many floors
because there were no garbage
cans.

By and large, however,
workers and organizers called
the book moving operation ‘‘a
tremendous success.”

“It was a super job,” Leach
said. “The enthusiasm and
esprit of the participants was
extraordinary.”

 

Students and townspeople walk the specially-constructed ramp
system as the library move progresses.

 

Townspeople,

Alumni help
move books

Hundreds of Lexington residents and
Washington and Lee alumni were among the
1,600 persons involved in yesterday’s book
transfer operation from the McCormick
Library to W&L’s new library.

Thirty townspeople worked during the
Christmas break taking a full inventory of
McCormick Library’s stock and putting up
shelving in the new library to prepare for
yesterday’s big move.

Other community members also worked
“behind the scenes’’ on moving day directing
traffic and ensuring that the books got to their
proper places.

Many other people, either directly or in-
directly involved with W&L, appeared yester-
day, to help transfer the books to the new
library.

Mrs. Henry Ravenhorst, wife of one of
W&L’s engineering professors, said ‘‘the
stairs going down (in the new library) are bad
on old knees.”’ She was undeterred, however,
and managed to make six trips back and forth
between the two libraries.

Two house mothers from Southern
Seminary Junior College in Buena Vista were
also there to work. Miss Beth Gannaway, the
former house mother of Pi Kappa Phi frater-
nity, was outside the new library with Mrs.
Alton Crowell after the move talking with the
students she had known at W&L.

Mrs. Crowell said she thought the move
“was just great, really something,” but she
did not expect to attend Wednesday evening’s
party for the workers.

Samuel Sanderson, W&L class of 1922, look-
ed a little disappointed, though, after travell-
ing from Natural Bridge Station.

“They told me to get here at 10:30, so I only
had time to do one load because it was over so
quickly,” he said.

Stuard Wurzburger, W&L class of 1928 and
one of the ‘‘behind the scenes’’ people direc-
ting the book moving operation, called the
move a “‘terrific job.”

“But,” he asked with a grin, ‘how many
years is it going to be until they find all the
books?”’

| Miller Beer
Is Refused

The Miller Brewing Company expressed
the desire to film a commercial during W&L’s
book moving day yesterday, but were turned
down by the administration before any real
negotiations could begin, the Ring-tum Phi
learned yesterday.

Robert S. Keefe, director of W&L’s news of-
fice, said the commercial would ‘‘not have
been appropriate’”’ because University Presi-
dent Robert E. R. Huntley is on the board of
trustees of Philip Morris Inc., which owns
Miller Brewing Company.

Keefe said that a sales representative of
Miller Beer apparently heard about the
library move and thought it might provide a
good opportunity for a television commercial
without being aware of Huntley’s position on
the board of Philip Morris.

The on-camera actors for the commercial
would have been professionals and not
students, Keefe said.

The sales representative mentioned the
possibility that Miller might donate kegs of
beer for the party after the move, Keefe said.

Pres. Huntley apparently thought that his
position on the board of Philip Morris might
give the appearance of putting pressure on

Miller to give the beer to the party, Keefe ex-

plained.
‘‘For that reason we did not explore the op-
tion of getting the beer for free,’’ Keefe said.
By coincidence, however, all of the beer at
Wednesday night’s party was Miller,
although the University paid for it.

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s new undergraduate stu-
dent library officially opened
this morning at 8a.m.

The library will operate on a
‘imited basis,’ according to
Maurice Leach, head librarian.

There will be a full circulation
service, a reserve service, and
a limited reference service.

“The books are there. The
major difficulities will be the of-
fices and the accessibility to the
people, but there will always be
someone there,’ Leach said.

The library will be open from
8 a.m. until midnight daily.

After the building is completed,
it will operate on a 24-hour basis
whenever school is in session.

There will be 560 study car-
rels in the building. In addition,
there are 15 small study rooms
on three of the floors, and one
room on each floor big enough
to be used as a seminar room.
There are two rooms on Lower
Level 1 big enough to seat 25
people.

An auditorium and rare book
room arefeatured to ‘provide a
place where the campus and the
town can have cultural
meetings,’’ Leach said.

 

    

 

University Throws

Party for Book Movers

Washington and Lee University threw a party last night
and it was a big success.

Almost 3,000 students, faculty, alumni, and townspeople
packed the lobby’ the main reading room, and the first floor
stack of McCormick Library in what was probably the big-
gest party W&L has ever thrown.

Forty kegs of beer flowed most of the night whileAce
Weams and the Fat Meat Boys and the Charlottesville
Allstars played to an enthusiastic crowd.

A green ticket proving participation in yesterday’s library
move was the price of admission. The tickets were fairly
easy to get because George W. Ray, who was dispensing the
tickets, gave them out to the many students who showed up at
the new library after the move had been completed six hours
ahead of schedule.

“Tf you feel guilty, just don’t have quite as good a time as
the other people,’”’ Ray would tell the latecomers.

One aspect of the party that was the most commented on
was the remarkable mixture of different people, many of
whom had probably never partied before.

The Ring-tum Phi diligently circulated through the party to
gather the comments of the party-goers: :

Pres. Huntley (Pres. W&L)—‘‘This is one of the best occas-
sions we’ve ever had at W&L with the mixture here of
students, faculty, and townspeople.”

Frank Parsons (assist. to the Pres.)—‘‘In our wildest dreams
we never envisioned something like this...especially like the
party going on in the stacks; it was a great day, the only trou-
ble was that we ran out of books for people to carry.”

Kathy Levi (Sweet Briar)—“I suggest that all schools turn
their libraries into party centers.”’

Buddy Bowie ( junior )—“‘One of the better parties the univer-
sity has ever had; if they had opened up the rest of the
library, we would have more room to move around in.”

Erica Gibson (RMWC)—‘‘Fantastic party; it’s the best party
you’ve ever had.”

Dean Dan Murphy—“‘It’s a fantastic time; it’s really good to
see the turnout by students and faculty, and all of them really
having a good time.”

Pam Wood (Sweet Briar)—‘‘Great party.”

John E. Hughes (former W&L information services
director )—‘‘This was a mediocre party until I met Pam.”

Andy Pick (sophomore )—‘‘This is the first time I’ve ever got-
ten maximum utility out of the library, but the girls were ug-
ly. ”

Elizabeth Minetree (Hollins)—‘‘It’s a good party, if you can
get to the beer and if you could find somebody you know.”’

Dean Atwood—‘‘It was imperative for me to come to this par-
ty as I live right next door to the old library and I could not go
to bed until the party was over because the music was so
seductive.”

Bill Tucker (senior )—‘“‘I asked Dean Atwood if he was overly
upset about the amount of beer spilled on the floor of his new
building and he replied, ‘I wouldn’t mind if it had been dark
beer.”

Cindy Stover (Sweet Briar )—‘They ought to initiate the new
library like this.”

Maurice Leach—“‘SUPER. The party for me is unique and
absolutely great; I’ve enjoyed the music and goodwill.”

Allison Straughn(‘‘Hollins and proud of it’’)—‘‘I think this
party is very crowded, but I’m having a blast.”’

Scott Graham (junior)—‘‘I’m having a blast too; one more
beer and I’ll really have a blast.”’

Dan Holleran (freshman)—‘‘Hell yeah I’m having a good
time; they have my favorite type of bands—rock and roll.”

Lisa Frey (RMWC)—‘‘It couldn’t have happened in a Walt
Disney movie.”

Beau Dudley (law student)—‘‘Not enough room, but so
what.”

Jim Lewis (freshman)—‘‘I wish Kristie was here.”’

Brenda Burch (RMWC)—‘‘It’s crowded, but great.”’

Marsh Dougherty (junior)—‘‘I like to have sex a lot.”’

Karen Duffield ‘(Hollins College)—‘‘I like being at W&L
where all the nice guys are, but the Allstars were ‘the best’.”’

Doug Perkins (alumnus, merchant)—‘‘The move was great,
theAllstars were super, the girls were fine, and the beers
were Sparse.”’

Kroll selected as
new baseball coach

Charles R. Kroll, a 1975
graduate of Ithaca (N.Y.)
College has been named in-
terim baseball coach at
Washington and Lee Univer-
sity. The announcement was
made by William D.
McHenry, Director of
Athletics at the University.

Kroll joined the
Washington and Lee coaching
staff in the fall as one of two
football interns, and was
responsible for the Generals’
defensive secondary this past
season. Prior to ‘joining the
W&L staff, the 26-year-old
Kroll served as a graduate
assistant at Albany (N.Y.)
State University. While earn-
ing his Masters degree in
Education at Albany, he serv-
ed as head’ junior varsity
baseball coach of a very suc-
cessful college division pro-
gram, and also coached the
defensive line for the football
team.

“Chuck possesses all the
qualities we were looking for
in a successful young coach,”
said McHenry, “In all his
past coaching positions, he
exhibited an ability to
motivate and assist in the
development of his players.
He has an excellent relation-
ship with his players both on
and off the field.”’

Canfield

By Bill Whalen

Five games into the 1978-79
season, Coach Verne Canfield
was faced with quite a dilem-
ma. His team was struggling
along with a 3-2 record; his
‘franchise’, Dave Leunig,
was sidelined with a knee in-
jury, and he had yet to find
that right combination of five
men. As if this were not
enough, his team was about
to embark on a four game
road trip to two tournaments
in which they were underdog-
ged.
But Canfield, the Wizard of
W&L Basketball, made two
simple adjustments—and the
results have been
devastating. The Coach in-
serted R.J. Scaggs and Pete
Farrell into the starting
lineup, and the new unit has
recorded a 4-1 skein, in-
cluding last night’s romp
over Castleton State.

Canfield had _ several
reasons for doing this. ‘‘It
wasn’t that our starting unit
was playing poorly—I felt
that it is important to have
these young guys working

Lyles as Washington and

The Washington & Lee
Generals beat Castleton State
100-74, last night, ina game in
which the only question was
whether or not the Generals
would reach the century
mark. The magic moment
came on Jim Berlin’s free
throw with 11 seconds, which
proved to be the only
highlight in an otherwise
sloppy game.

The Generals, who now
stand at 7-3, struggled with
the outmanned Spatans
before putting on a 20-6 scor-
ing spurt to post a 54-37 lead
at halftime. -

Any hopes of a Castleton
comeback were quickly end-
ed in the opening minutes of

the second half as_ the
Generals pulled away to a
70-47 tead. From this point the
outcome was academic, as
Coach Verne Canfield
substituted freely with his
bench.

Leading the scoring parade
was Pete Farrell, who bomb-
ed in 21 points. Tom Jeffries
and Berlin both added 17, a
career high for Berlin.

pulled off their second tour-
nament upset in a row.

W&L 76 Edinboro 72

Carby Hoy’s 22 points and
Tom Jeffries’ 20 proved to be
too much as W&L defeated
Division II Edinboro, 76-72.
The Generals led 43-29 at the
half and 49-34 before Edin-
boro closed the gap to 74-72.
Pete Farrell then hit two free
throws to put the game away.
W&L hit on 24 of 29 free
throws while Edinboro miss-
ed on 55 shots.

Allegheny 73 W&L 64

The W&L road-game winn-
ing streak was ended at three
games when Allegheny
knocked off the Generals,
83-74, in the finals of the
Gator Auto Basketball
Classic. The Generals, who
trailed by 19 points with 12
minutes left, came back to
within three points before
finally succumbing to
Allegheny. Hoy and Jeffries,
who led W&L with 16 and 13
points respectively, were
both named all-tourney.

This weekend is the annual
W&L Invitational Tourna-
ment.

The Generals will face
Maryville in the opening
round on Friday nite at 9:00.
They will play either Ursinus

makes new lineup; ends slump

together”, said the Coach.
“Plus, we now have two
seniors (Mike Wenke and Jim
Berlin) who can come off the
bench and give us some
poise.”’ The new lineup starts
two juniors—Tom Jeffries
and Farrell—and three
sophomores—Scaggs, Carby
Hoy and Rob Smitherman.

In the Rose-Hulman
Tourney, the lineup was
perfect. Hoy was named
MVP of the two games, while
the other four players con-
tributed Key points, assists
and rebounds. In the Gator
Classic, Mike Wenke was a
big factor as he provided both
spark and leadership.

If there is one weakness, it
is the lack of overall height.
After the 6-7 Smitherman, the
next tallest if Jeffries at 6-3,
Scaggs at 6-2, Hoy at 6-1 and
Farrell at 6-0. In_ the
General’s loss to Lynchburg,
one of the major problems
was an incapacity to stop the
Hornets’ taller rebounders.

This could happen again.

The highlight of Canfield’s
new arrangement is that it
allows for five under-
calssmen to develop into a
strong unit. Said one observer
in the press box last nite:
“With that lineup, W&L is on-
ly a year away from being a
powerhouse’’.

Swim team 0-3; meets G. W. U. on Sat.

The Washington and Lee
swim team splashes into action
this Saturday against George
Washington after a dismal 0-3
‘pre-Christmas break start.
Coach Bill Stearns attributes
the lack of success to a drawn
out water polo season, but says
he is still confident that the
team will qualify for the Na-
tionals.

Swimming well individually
for the Generals are Captains
Keith Romich and Chip Hoke,
says Stearns. Romich is ranked
in the top five nationally in the
100 free, 200 free, and 200 fly,
setting ‘a new school record in

this event. According to
Stearns, Hoke will ‘‘probably be
ranked’’ in the near future also.
A third All-American, Bob
Newcomb, is swimming well,
says Stearns. Leading the
divers is Jay Diesing, who won
in an upset against VMI.

Five of the swimmers com-
peted during the Christmas
break with thousands of other
swimmers the Fort Lauderdale
Hall of Fame.

Stearns also pointed to the
fact that the Generals are
swimming against Division I
teams that are becoming more

and more inclined to give away
more scholarships. He said that
this is making it harder for
schools like W&L to compete on
this basis.

The Generals are readying

for an away meet with George
Washington on Saturday. W&L
then hosts Morris Harvey on the
following Friday and swim
against Towson State at VMI on
that Saturday.

Rolf Piranian, Washington
and Lee’s soccer coach since
1976, has devised a method
wherein soccer players from all
walks of University life are able
to keep in shape in the off-
season and keep themselves oc-
cupied at the same time. It is in-
door soccer, and it’s success,
which is based on its popularity,
has increased tremendously

Wrestlers

The W&L grapplers, 0-1 in
the 1978-79, return to action
this Saturday hosting Duke
and George Washington,
beginning at 1 p.m. in the
Warner Center. There is no
admission charge. W&L will
compete in The Citadel In-
vitational next weekend.

The Ring-tum Phi, Jan. 11, 1979, Page 9

Indoor soccer tourney to be

held at W&L is open to all

since its inception at the beginn-
ing of Piranian’s tenure as head
coach.

The progrem, now in its third
year, culminates with a tourna-
ment in which neighboring
teams are invited to come and
to compete against the best
which W&L has to offer. Pira-
nian is especially pleased with
the attitudes of the teams which
participate in the tournament.
Although many old rivalries are
renewed in the playing of the
games, Piranian says that “a
spirit of comradeship exists’’
among the players, and that
there is no “obsession to win,
that the main object is to havea
good time.” This year, the tour-
nament will take place on Sun-
day, Jan. 28, from 8:30 a.m. un-
til 7:40 p.m. in W&L’s Doremus
Gymnasium.

Leading up to and surroun-
ding the tournament is a league,
which anyone is welcome to

join. The main idea behind the
league is divided into two parts.
It is for the soccer players to
keep in shape during the winter,
and, more importantly, it is an
opportunity for anyone to stay
active during the winter, when
the weather is bad and gym
time is restricted due to the
other athletic programs. This is
the first year in which enough
people have shown an interest
to organize the program into a
such a format. Previously, it
was strictly on a pick-up basis:
Over one half of the current
players are not members of the
soccer team. This shows the ap-
peal which the program has for
a wide variety of students, both
grads and undergrads, as well
as faculty members.

Anyone is still welcome to
join, and if you are interested,
please see Coach Piranian for
assignment to a team and a
schedule.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thoughts on
‘the big move”

The great library move has come and gone after
months of preparation, and heads are still shaking, in
stunned—but pleased—disbelief. Plans originally
called for a volunteer force of 900-1000 people, work-
ing approximately seven hours. But even the most op-
timistic observers were amazed at the final results of
yesterday’s project. Well over 1,500 people arrived for
the move, many of them appearing promptly at 8:30
a.m. And on top of this, the entire production was
completed in under three hours—which must be some
sort of record for volunteer participation.

 

So many people gave their time and expertise to
this event that listing all names would be impossible.
Even so, recognition must be given to some outstan-
ding individuals. Many students have asked which
professional moving company could have devised the
intricate routing system used Wednesday. In point of
fact, the chief honors go to Margaret Williams of
W&L’s own library staff, who began work on this pro-
blem almost one year ago...Steve Mangan, student
chairman of the event, should also be applauded for
his ability to handle endless orientations, name tags,
T-shirts, hole punchers, and the like...The Library
Move Committee, formed by Mr. Mangan and con-
sisting of students and faculty-administration figures,
has also been working steadily since September. This
group suggested the prizes, planned the evening par-
ty, handled publicity matters—and were among the
first to believe strongly that the project had some
chance of success...And riding at the crest of the
wave, Maurice Leach and his library staff receive the
heartiest thanks of all, for their literally unending pa-
tience and leadership. We hope they’re happy in their
new home, completed after years of dynamite
blasting and construction.

 

When the move came to its early finish, many peo-
ple took the opportunity to stroll through the empty
rooms of McCormick Library. If anything ap-

proaching nostalgia is possible when dealing with-

such a building, this was the time for it—and many
old-timers traded stories in the vacant halls. The
most interesting is the oft-repeated tale that the base-
ment of McCormick was the “hiding place’’ for the
Declaration of Independence and the English Magna
Carta during World War II. McCormick, newly
renovated in 1941, was chosen by the Library of Con-
gress for its quiet location and proximity to
Washington. The Magna Carta, then in New York for
display at the World’s Fair, joined the American
documents at W&L when a trans-Atlantic return trip
grew too dangerous.

The papers remained locked away until the close of
the war, and only then was their location revealed...

In retrospect, this has been a week of immense
achievement on the W&L campus. All who par-
ticipated in the move should be proud of playing a
part in the biggest campus-wide activity in recent
years —a single day that, in many ways, symbolized
the growth and prosperity that has been the hallmark
of W&L in the busy 1970’s. In any event, thanks to the
students and other workers, the university received a
New Year’s present that will not be forgotten...

Dorm counselor positions open

Applications are invited for the positions of

Freshman and Uppercalss Dormitory
Counselors for the 1979-80 academic year.
These positions are among the most responsi-
ble entrusted to Washington and Lee students.

guidelines for the selection of Dormitory
Counselors have been established. Applicants
must be at least current sophomores, and
should not have commitments after 8:00 p.m.
which would routinely taken them away from
the dormitory for any appreciable time.
While counselorships are not awarded on an
academic basis, a student who has failed to
maintain a 2.0 average would probably not be
selected. Any counselor who is placed on
Academic Probation after being selected will
be asked to resign.

In order to insure their availability to
counselors are provided with a single room in
the dormitory and with the dinner meal,
which they are expected to eat in Evans Din-
ing Hall. Each counselor will also be expected
to live in his dormitory room seven nights a

-week and MAY NOT SHARE THE RENTAL
ON OR HAVE AN OFF-CAMPUS APART-
MENT.

The primary basis for selection of dor-
mitory counselors will be the applicant’s
general fitness in making the dormitories
suitable living quarters for a_ student’s
freshman year. Each applicant is encouraged
to obtain from Mrs. Miller, the Dean of

From the

Students’ secretary, a copy of a statement
describing more fully the goals of our counsel-
ing system, the personality characteristics
thought needful in a counselor and the skills
we expect. .
STUDENTS WHO ARE PRESENTLY
DORMITORY COUNSELORS and who wish
to reapply for next year should submit LET-
TERS to this effect to the Office of the Dean of
Students, Payne Hall 6, by 4:00 p.m. on FRI-
DAY, JANUARY 19. Returning candidates
should also indicate if they wish to apply for
Head Counselor or Assistant Head Counselor.
NEW APPLICANTS FOR COUNSELOR
POSITIONS in the freshman and upperclass
dormitories should submit LETTERS to this
effect to the Office of the Dean of Students,
Payne Hall 6, by 4:00 p.m. on FRIDAY,

reason(s) for wanting the position: Further
details concerning duties and responsibilities
can be obtained from Steve Jones; Head Dor-
mitory Counselor, and George Berry, Mike
Busbey, Chip Hoke, Bill Thistlethwaite of the

More on Junkin

(continued from page 4)

In 1949, when he arrived to
found Washington and Lee’s art
department, Junkin was award-
ed an honorary doctorate. The
citation described him as ‘‘an
artist whose discerning eye has
perceieved beauty and whose
knowing hand has created it . . .
a teacher with a zeal to share
the satisfactions of the world of
art.”

_ Among the notable paintings
in the W&L exhibition is “First
Robin,” singled out for praise

by Life magazine in 1941.
Another is his whimsical
“Autobiography” (1944), in
which Junkin shows himself
-balancing -the demands of
teaching, painting and family
life against backdrops of his
professional environments --
Washington and Lee, New York
City and Nashville.

A number of the paintings are
of Lexington scenes, including
views of Washington and Lee,
Virginia Military Institute and
Goshen Pass. Many of the
others show foreign landscapes
and shorescapes, and there are
a number of portraits and street
scenes, reflecting Junkin’s ap-
preciation of the urban lower

classes, especially blacks in the
1930s and ‘40s.

Most of the works in the
memorial exhibition are from
the collection of his family.
Others are on loan from public
and private collections.

McCormick Renovation Begins
$3.5 Million Project to Take 18 Months

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity will begin a $3.5-million, 18-
month project shortly to
renovate and completely
remodel its Cyrus Hall McCor-
mick Library building to
become the new home of W&L’s
School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics.

W&L moved from 73-year-old
McCormick to a new $9.2-
million undergraduate library
building last week.

McCormick will provide more
than three times as much
usable space for the W&L com-
merce division as its current
facility, Newcomb Hall -- 37,545
square feet vs. 11,542.

The commerce school has
been located in Newcomb since
it was founded in 1906 as the
School of Commerce and Ad-
ministration.

The ‘‘new’’ commerce
building will have seven
classrooms, including two

auditorium-like ‘‘conference
classrooms,’ one seating 80 and
the other 50; three seminar
rooms; several studies, and of-
fices for 23 faculty members,

 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
 

Twenty-three undergrad
and law students at Washingtpy
and Lee University here we
“tapped” today into membe
ship in Omicron Delta Kappa}
the national honorary leader-
ship society.

The ‘‘tapping’’ ceremony took
place as part of W&L’s annual
Founders’ Day convocation.

The society, which now has
chapters on the campuses of
more than 125 colleges and
universities throughout the na-
tion, was established at
Washington and Lee in 1914.

ODK recognizes superior
leadership achievements in
several fields — athletics, stu-
dent politics, publications,
social and religious affairs, and
the creative arts. Students
“‘tapped’’ must also rank in the
top third of their academic
class.

The twenty-three Washington
and Lee students inducted into
W&L’s Alpha Chapter during
the ceremony today are:

John C. Bovay, Lakeland,
Fla., undergranduate senior ac-
counting major — member, Stu-
dent Recruitment Committee
(admissions), Who’s Who in
Colleges and Universities, and

the dean and staff.

The reading room in old Mc-
Cormick Library will be kept as
the library and reading room in
the commerce school: Current
professional periodicals and
reference and _ research
volumes will supplement the
main commerce collection in
the new undergraduate library.

In addition to extensive
seating capacity in the com-
merce library room, there will
be two nearby rooms of student
carrels — private desk-and-
shelf areas which may be
reserved for an academic term
ata time.

Grain Cups
Arrive

According to University
librarian Maurice D. Leach, the
two thousand souvenir grain
cups — scheduled to be
distributed during last week’s
library move — have finally ar-
rived.

Distribution of the cups has
already begun, and all who par-
ticipated in ‘‘The Great Move”’
are eligible to pick one up
behind the circulation desk in
the new library.

Two thousand of the cups
were ordered by the Library
Move Committee in the late fall,
stated chairman Steve Mangan.
Sufficient time was allowed for
delivery, but the company in
charge of production accidently
mailed the cups to ‘William
and Mary — Lexington,
Virginia,’’ resulting in the late
arrival.

EC Approves Payment

of Student Photographer |

by Randy Smith

The Executive Committee
voted Monday night to allow a
yearbook editor to be paid for
taking fraternity pictures for
this year’s publication.

The EC voted 8-4 to allow
Layout Editor Chris Volk to be
paid $10 for each group picture
of Washington and Lee’s 16
fraternities used in this year’s
Calyx. The money for his com-
mission will come out of the
yearbook’s operating budget.

Grant Leister, business
manager of the Calyx, asked
the EC if paying a student to do
work normally done for free
would be a ‘“‘conflict cf  in-
terest.”

Leister explained that tne
publication had run_ into
deadline complications and had
neither the manpower not the
equipment to take the pictures
by today’s time limitation.

(Leister had originally con-
tacted the Andre photographic
studios in town and was told the
job could be done by today’s
deadline for $20 a fraternity.)

The yearbook’s own
photography staff could not do
the job because they were busy
with other work this week and
did not have a wide-angle lens,
Leister said. It was then that
Volk offered to take the pictures
for $10.

‘“‘What it boils down to is not
the equipment, but the
availability of the
photographers,”’ Neil Sheehan,
Photography Editor of the
Calyx, told the EC. “We are
understaffed.” :

‘How does the staff feel about
another staff member being
paid for the work they do for
free?’’ asked Rob Benfield,
senior EC representative.

“T think it’s a pretty raw
deal,’’ said Leister.

(It was also disclosed that
Volk had _ resigned as
Photography Editor of the
Ring-tum Phi, giving a heavy
work load as the reason for his
resignation. )

“Chris is merely acting as a
businessman and marketing the
skills he has,’”’ said Sheehan.
“There are many people who
will sacrifice their time for a
fee,’’ he added.

‘“‘We’ve got to have those pic-
tures by Thursday night,”
Leister said, ‘‘and Chris has
already taken four pictures.”

“I think the only option we
have is to go with the lowest bid
available, even if it is a stu-
dent,”’ sophomore EC represen-
tative Bob Willis said.

Rob Calvert, senior EC rep.,
formally made the motion that
“Chris Volk receive his fees and
do the work ‘“‘

 

Correction

In the two Executive Commit-
tee stories published in last
week’s Ring-tum Phi, represen-
tative Steve Abraham was in-
correctly identified as a
sophomore.

Abraham is a junior.
The Ring-tum Phi regrets the
jerror.

 

 

 

Voting in a losing battle
against the payment were: Ben-
field, Bill Tucker, EC vice-
president, Tom McCarthy, EC
secretary, and Steve Abraham,
junior representative.

“This action sets the prece-
dent of paying students to do the
work they should be doing for
free,” Tucker said after the
meeting.

‘“‘We were caught in a bind in
having to vote for it’’ because it
was the only option, Benfield
said.

McCarthy said that although
there was no alternative to pay-
ing Volk with the deadline so
close, he was against the pay-
ment “‘in principle.”

John Murphy, EC law school
representative, said that the
complications in the location of
the fraternity reception for
former Sen. James Buckley
were the result of a “lack of
communication between the
Coatact committee and the In-
terfraternity Council.”’

(The reception for Buckley
was scheduled to be held at the

Three Fraternities Placed
on Social Probation

Three fraternities were plac-
ed on social probation for fail-
ing to meet requirements on
fraternity inspection checklists
at Tuesday:night’s Interfrater-
nity Council meeting.

Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Phi
Epsilon, and Phi Gamma Delta
were all put on two weeks social
probation after a spot inspec-
tion Tuesday found that they
had not met all the re-
quirements on the inspection
checklists.

(Members of a fraternity on
social probation are not allowed
to have parties or attend
organized school functions on
campus. )

IFC member Syd Farrar said
that SPE did not have emergen-
cy phone numbers listed by the
telephones.

PiKA’s house manager said
that they had seven cracked
windows, garbage strewn out of
their garbage pit, one fire ex-
tinguisher empty, and one par-
tially empty.

(One PiKA member said that
these problems met specifica-
tions when the checklist was
completed, but that a freshman
raid on the fraternity house
created the deficiencies. )

The fraternities can appeal
their penalties to the Student
Affairs Committee.

Also at Tuesday’s IFC
meeting it was announced that
Chi Psi was the winner of the
fraternity participation contest
in last week’s library move,
with all 16 members helping.

Second was SPE with 95 per-
cent attendance showing, and
Phi Kappa Sigma came in third
with 85 percent.

As the first place winner, Chi
Psi will receive three kegs of
beer and a commemorative pla-
que in the new library. Second
place will be given a W&L
chair, and third place will
receive two kegs.

The IFC also announced that
it donated $100 to the
Rockbridge Christmas basket.

Admissions Up. 549 Applications Received

by Charlie Smith

Applications for admission to
Washington and Lee are runn-
ing 33 percentof the number of
applications received by the
University at this time last
year, school officials told the
Ring-Tum Phi Tuesday.

According to William Hartog,
Director of Admissions, the
school has received 549 applica-
tions so far, compared with 433
on Jan. 16 of last year.

In addition, a ‘‘record
number’’ of people applied for
early admission this year, Har-
tog said. Of 80 early decision

candidates, 34 were accepted.
This is the same number as
were selected as last year,
which indicates that the school
was more selective in this
regard, he said.

If applications continue to be
received at the present rate, the
University expects to reach
about 1,150 applications for ad-
mission, or about 175 more than
last year, Hartog said.

‘Of the 1,150 applicants, it is
hoped that there will be a total
acceptance of between 590 to 630
students. Hartog said that of
that number, the yield — or

Marathon Registration

by John Billmyre

Registration for W&L’s
Dance Marathon will begin
within the next two weeks, Jay
Blumberg, coordinator of the
event announced Tuesday.

The marathon is presently
scheduled for March 23-24, a
date that accommodates the
largest number of local girls’
schools.

The tenative schedule calls
for a rock band Friday night
and two bands, one disco and
one soul, Saturday night. Ex-
cept for breaks every hour, the
msuic will be continuous.
Special events are still in the

planning stages.

Anyone interested in par-

ticipating is urged to register
before the Washington Holiday
break. Forms for registration
can be found in a package of in-
formation about the dance
marathon. The packages will be
available within two weeks.

Blumberg said the goal for
the marathon is one hundred
couples and $5,000. Those who
plan to particpate must have a
minimum of $30 in pledges.

Pledges do not have to go by
the hour.

number of students who will ac-
tually decide to go to other
schools despite admission to
W&L — should range from 48 to
56 percent.

Hartog said that with the
greater number of applicants,
he feels the school will probably
be more selective than last

year, and thus admit fewer

students.

Hartog said he sees this year
as the beginning of a crucial
period of recruiting and admis-

sions at Washington and Lee.

Last year, admissions fell by
about 30 percent, ‘‘a precipitous
drop which not many schools
could have survived,’’ Hariog
said. ;

Although the large drop in ad-
mission . applications ‘ cai sed
concern among some school of-
ficials, Hartog maintains that

average and the academic

Ring-tum Phi Housing Series

 

Student Housing In Town Has Its

Part I
by Randy Smith

Gary Goodenow and his two room-
mates had no hot water until mid-
October, even though they had been
paying rent since August 15.

The hot water heater did not work
and the gas company condemned it.

It was not until the middle of October
when the landlady’s plumber had
replaced the heater’s exhaust system
with the proper pipe so that it could
pass the gas company’s safety inspec-
tion (the safety valve was also broken,
but the gas company let the heater pass
anyway).

There was also a large pile of gar-
bage in the backyard when they arrived
for the fall semester.

The landlady’s only explanation for
the trash was that the person she had
commissioned to clean up the mess had
not gotten around to it yet.

Goodenow and his roommates pay
$200 a month rent (excluding utilities)
to live in their house on Randolph
Street, only a five minute walk from the
Washington and Lee colonnade.

As originally arranged, the only
source of heat was an old central heater
with two vents in the downstairs en-
trance hallway. The central heater was
supposed to heat the entire house,
upstairs included, even though the
house had not been properly insulated.

“She said, ‘Leave the doors open and
the heat will disperse all over the
house’,”’ said Bob Sillman, another resi-
dent of the house.

“It was very cold when you got up in
the morning,’’ Goodenow said.

After some time, the landlady was
persuaded by her student tenants to put
an electric heater in one of the upstairs
bedrooms and a gas heater in the
bedroom downstairs.

But the coming of colder winter
weather brought on other problems.

 

A builder has said that this chimney
will fall.

A pipe burst in the basement.

The pipe was part of the plumbing of
an old bathroom no longer in use. .

‘As soon as she (the landlady) heard
that the pipe was broken she asked,
‘Have you had the -heater on down
there’?’”’ Goodenow said.

“She told us to leave the heater on all
the time so the pipes — which aren’t in-
sulated — wouldn’t freeze.

“She sets down the rules for who pays
for broken pipes in the lease, so we have
to do as she says, even though the
heater was red-tagged (condemned) by

Ine KMING-IUIME rill, Jdll. 1%, i7/7, Payeoo

Problems

 

This ‘‘red-tagged”’ heater is the only safeguard keeping uninsulated basement water pipes from freez-
ing.

the gas company for not having an ex-
haust system,’’ Goodenow said.

(Anti-freeze was also poured into the
basement bathroom plumbing to guard
against frozen pipes. )

In addition, when the students took
over the house in September the lawn
had not been cut, there was trash in
front of the house, and the kitchen had
not been cleaned, Goodenow said.

The proper ventilation systems were
not installed until early October, so
they had no heat or hot water until then,
even though they, too, had been paying
rent since mid-August.

“It’s the landlady’s responsibility to
check out her property and make sure
everything is in working order,” said
Phil Madeloff, another resident, ‘after
all, we do pay $300 a month rent.”’

The students also complained about a
leak from the upstairs bathroom
(which has a bathtub) through the ceil-
ing into the hallway.

The leak seems to be a recurrence of
an old problem; the ceiling appears to
have been plastered over several times
in the past.

“There is just a general deterioration
of the floor upstairs and the ceiling

 

“You sort of have to fight the world to get housing in this town,

and we just didn’t jump into the housing race fast enough.”’

 

A builder told them that their
chimney will fall down eventually, that
it is only a matter of time.

“She did paint the outside of the
house over the summer,,’ Goodenow
said, “and she did pay for new
lightbulbs — about $4 worth.”’

Goodenow calls the house he is living
ina “hovel” anda ‘‘den of horrors.”’

“It’s our fault that we’re living in this
dump,” he said.

‘You sort of have to fight the world to
get housing in this town, and we just
didn’t jump into the housing race fast
enough,” he continued.

Goodenow and his roommates
estimate they will each pay $1,100 this
year for their present housing
(including rent and utilities) and they
do not think they are getting their
money’s worth.

Case No. 2

Nearby is another house rented by
five W&L students. Although their pro-
blems are not nearly as severe as those
experienced by Goodenow and _ his
roommates, there are similarities.

“‘The gas company had to come three
times and wouldn’t turn on the gas
because of a number of problems,
among them inadequate ventilation for
the heaters in the house,” Joe Scott told
theRing-tum Phi.

“And our landlady had been made
aware of the situation at least by the
beginning of the summer,” he con-
tinued.

“In other words, the house was not
ready for habitation,”” commented Guy
Steuart, another student living in the
house.

“In order to heat my room, a new
heater had to be installed, but they
didn’t exactly finish the job,” said
Scott, ‘“‘so on a clear day, I can look
through the cracks in the old fireplace
and watch the grass grow.”

“We just don’t know when the whole
thing’s going to cave in,” added Scott.

“But then, where else could we live?”’
he asked.

by Mark Mainwarinry

After a slow to average fall
season, the concert calendar
for both Lexington and
Roanoke is definitely looking
up, at least for the next month
or so.

Locally, the Glenn Phillips
Group returns io the Cockpit
for two nights later this
month (Jan. 26 and 27). The
band played here last year to
an extremely enthusiastic
reception. But the real news
as far as Cockpit entertain-
ment has to be the upcoming
shows by the Nighthawks
(Feb. 7). Having seen the
band in Blacksburg last spr-
ing, I can attest that they’re
one of the finest performing
groups you’re likely to see,
particularly in a setting as in-
timate as the Pit. There’ll be
two shows, and a three dollar
cover charge.will be col-
lected at the door.

Moving down to Roanoke,
the next two weeks will
feature two interesting shows
at the Civic Center. Despite
the critical panning of their
most recent release, Boston
continues to tour and sell
zillions of albums — they’ll be
appearing at the Roanoke
Civic Center on Jan. 24.
Boston is surprisingly good
onstage, and they’re no doubt
improved their presentation
since I saw them in Roanoke
nearly two years ago. Open-
ing act is Sammy Hagar, a
talented but undistinguished
rocker of the arena variety. !

One week later, (Jan. 31),
Heart will take the stage, im-
mediately preceeded by
Firefall. Both groups have
had a great degree of com-
mercial success of late, and
should present an interesting

Firefall with its softer,

Cye And Ear: From The Bookstore

So a book is on the Best Seller
list. What does that mean? Pro-
bably nothing more than a total,
rather vaguely arrived at, from
a scattering of bookstores
around the country. Busy
booksellers seldom have time to
precisely count the actual
number of each title which have
been sold in the past week. (In.

truth, this week’s Best Seller
lists have been released to us
promoters ten days earlier! )

The Best Seller list gives

booksellers a quick gimmick -

with which to convince
customers that they really do
want to pay $12.50 for Fools Die

nothings of the paperback and

One thing for sure, it does not
mean that a best seller is a
great book. Hardly ever,
although it can happen. Good
books, yes — _ entertaining
books, yes — helpful books,
sometimes. Too, other books of
equal or greater value languish
in the shade, unlit by the
awesome rays of the Best Seller
list. Do Howard Nemerov or
Jorges Luis Borges appear? No,
but we have Linda Goodman’s
Love Signs andJackie Oh!
William Faulkner was long past
the years of his greatest writing
before he ever ‘“‘made it’’ to the
elite roster of the Best Seller.

Those of us who care deeply
about language and ideas must
be grateful, however, that the
Best Seller list convinces people
to come into bookstores, to go
on buying books, and to almost
accidently discover the special
books that never glare from the
top 15. And finally, there’s the
odd occasion when a great book

Eastwood turns

loose a

by Dick Barron

America has always felt com-
fortable with the type of movie
known as the Western. The good
ole cowboy flick has always
packed ’em in. In the 60’s, a new
breed of western was born, br-
inging with it a new breed of
star, one of the most enduring of
which has been Clint Eastwood.
Eastwood began with the
western, but he knew when to
quit. The popularity of the
western drama waned in the
early 70’s, and Eastwood
jumped right into his cops and
robbers phase, which was just a
re-packaged version of the old
shoot-em-ups. The days of the
Law and Order flick began to
fade, but the truck driver movie
was right around the corner, to
pick up the slack.

This is the new American
frontier story — the noble
cowboy has given up the clatter
of hooves for the roar of a
diesel. This modern classic
story has given us such
lightweight thrillers as White
Line Fever, Smokey and the
Bandit, and Convoy. The for-
mula runs something like this:
our hero has a job to do (often il-
legal), the fat, stupid sheriff
aims to stop him, “‘ if I have to
chase him clear to Santa Fe,”
and every mother’s son from
Tuscon to Talladega is out to
pick a fight with him, but all is
saved, at the expense of several
very fast cars. Granted, Every
Which Way but Loose is not the
typical trucking movie, but it
operates within the same kind
of formula approach — Clint
Eastwood, the hard fightin’,
hard workin’ guy, meets and
loses his new girl’ a sweet coun-
try singer, and he sets off to find
her. He encounters the villians,
the ever-popular _ sheriff
character is the same type we
saw in the other truck flicks, but
this sheriff isn’t quite as obnox-
ious.

There are enough comic

touches to make the film slight- ©

ly more subtle in its humor than
other similar films. Clyde,
Eastwood’s orangutan is as
engaging a character as Or-
ville, Eastwood’s human friend
(Geoffrey Lewis). Clyde’s ar-

winner

ranged meeting with a female
ape is given the perfect note of
comedy with the sound of
Charlie Rich’s ‘‘Behind Closed
Doors.”’ The well-chosen sound-
track, a country music hit-
parade, is sparingly applied,
adding a well-seasoned flavor to
otherwise bland moments.
James Fargo’s direction is solid
throughout the film, neither
flashy nor sloppy, showing in
crisp detail the beauty of the
Western United States.

Sondra Locke, as Eastwood’s
dream girl, does a competent
job with her ordinary role. The
big hero, Eastwood, shows us
that he really does have the
ability to portray human
warmth — a revelation which
seems almost wasted in a film
of this lightweight type. Writer
Jeremy Kronsberg keeps the
whole thing together, although
getting a little out of control

with the over-frequent fight

scenes. Nevertheless, that’s
what you expect from a western
where the cowboys ride pick-
ups, and Gabby Hayes has turn-
ed into an orangutan named
Clyde.

California Suite

Neil Simon returns with his
latest offering, California Suite.
The prolific Simon has given us
such hits as The Odd Couple and
The Goodbye Girl and such
losers as Murder by Death.
California Suite is an_ in-
teresting Hodgepodge of Simon
at his worst and best.

The film consists of four
unrelated stories. The action oc-
curs in and around a large L.A.
hotel. In the first story, Jane
Fonda. and Alan Alda are
superb as the divorced couple
fighting over their daughter.
The story shows the clash of two
cultures — New York tradi-
tional vs. California trendy. The
other stories involve an English
actress in Hollywood for the
Academy Awards, two couples
on vacation in L.A. anda manin
town for his nephew’s Bar Mitz-
vah. The Alda-Fonda scenes are

WLUR

“A.M. on FM,” a new weekly
radio program to be broadcast
by WLUR, will begin this week
with Shakespeare’s ‘‘Othello,”’
starring Paul Robeson, Jose
Ferrer, and Uga Hagen.

Each Thursday at 9:30 a.m.,
the new program will present a
well-known play from either
English or American Theatre.

On Jan. 25, ‘A.M. on FM”
will present ‘Death of a
Salesman” by Arthur Miller.

Robert J. DeMaria, assistant
professor of journalism, will
moderate the program.

Fassbinder, is one of the best
known directors in the contem-
porary West German film
renaissance. (Fassbinder’s 1976
film Chinese Roulette was the
Society’s last movie.) The
American Friend, Wenders’
third film, is a fusion of popular
cinema — the Hollywood
thriller — and a traditionally
more serious cinematic mode,
the character study.

This fusion comes in the wake
of the “French New Wave,” a
development of the 50’s and 60’s
characterized by extreme self-
consciousness of the medium, in
which movies alluded to or used
film history, other films, other
film styles, and other directors
as a frame of reference.

The perimeters of ‘‘serious’’
film were often made more flex-
ible as a result, as is evident, for
instance, in Truffaut’s Shoot the
Piano Player, and Roman
Polanski’s Chinatown.

In The American Friend, a
murder is committed, and the
movie then focuses on the mind
of the murderer as he moves
almost continuously through in-
ternationally cosmopolitan
landscapes of neon-intense col-

or. American moviegoers will
recognize in particular Dennis
Hopper, best remembered for
his role in Easy Rider.

The film’s emotional center is
the relationship between the
murderer (Bruno Ganz) and the
professional killer (Dennis Hop-
per) who is his contact.
Wenders’ films tend to concen-
trate on the emotional inten-
sities between men in the same
way that Ingmar Bergman’s
films concentrate on the emo-
tional intensities between
women. But in The American
Friend, intimacy culminates in
a physical contact which is
achieved trhough violence
rather than through touching.

The Film Society’s next film,
to be shown in February, will be
Louis Malle’s Zazie, a French

comedy.
Society members. are
welcome to join the Film Selec-

tion Committee which will meet
at 4:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan.
24, in Payne 32F (3rd floor) to
consider the next few films in
the series. We will vote on the
two films to be shown after
Zazie at an open meeting on
Jan. 31, at8 p.m. in Payne 3.

 

Pit showcases
Brazilian quartet

This Saturday night, the
featured band in the Cockpit
will be Minas (pronounced
Meen - yas). Minas is authentic
Brazilian music— one moment
soft and flowing, the next,
energetic and exciting. In their
interpretation of the music of
Antonio Carlos Jobim, one can
imagine the beautiful beaches
with big blue canvas skies, the
red hot sun, colorful people and
a happy life. In contrast, when
they play the ‘‘samba” and
“carnival” music, one is arous-
ed in a primitive sense by the
full and energetic sounds of the
rhythmic percussion Percus-
sion with mixtures of African
and Brazilian elements where
one desires to move and feel the
music.

The voices are soft and soar-
ing, the instruments sensitive
and alive. The mood is happy,

 

Now playing at duPont:

Summer of °42 starring Jennifer O’Neill, Gary Grimes, Jerry
Houser

Astory of growing up complete with the adolescent yearning and
fumbling, adventures and hesitant forays into the mysteries of the
opposite sex. The Summer of ’42 is the story of a boy named Hermie
— 15-years-old and on the threshold of manhood. A simple human
comedy with a timeless feeling...as true today as it was in ’42. The
film is a touching memory piece — it unravels like a bolt of satin in
simple, precise, measured sequences.

McCormick renovation plans unveiled

renovation. Bass was also
W&L’s agent for the new
library, and university officials
said they were impressed both
with the quality of the firm’s
work and with the construction
schedule Bass observed on that
project -- which was completed

report to the trustees of what
was then called Washington
College in 1869.

McCormick is actually two
buildings — one inside the
other. The central section was
built in 1906, and the library was
then named for Andrew
Carnegie. In 1941 it was

sideration is for one humanities
department and perhaps two in
social sciences to be relocated
in Newcomb,

When they were first built,
neither Newcomb Hall nor
Carnegie Library was architec-

 

six months ahead of original
projections.

As~ with the new
undergraduate library, the
principal subcontractors will be
Harris Heating & Plumbing Inc.
(mechanical) and Howard P.
Foley Co. (electrical), both of
Richmond.

Charles W. Barger & Son of
Lexington will again be the sub-
contractor for excavation,
underground utility-tunnel con-
struction, and architectural and
structural concrete.

W&L’s commerce school is
the oldest in the south. Though
not established until the first
years of the 20th century, the
impetus to add a “commercial
school” to the curriculum
traces to a recommendation by
Robert E. Lee in his annual

FRONT ELEVATION 4

remodeled and enlarged —-by
constructing a new building
around the walls of Carnegie.
The facility was then renamed
for _Cyrus McCormick, the
Rockbridge County native who
invented the reaper. McCor-
mick was an_ important
benefactor and trustee of
Washington and Lee following
the Civil War.

After the commerce school
moves into McCormick, its cur-
rent facility, Newcomb, will be
renovated to house
undergraduate departments in
W&L’s liberal arts and sciences
division, The College, which are
similarly overcrowded and
scattered in various buildings
on the Colonnade. Current con-

turally in harmony with the rest
of the W&L Colonnade.
Newcomb, built in 1882, had a
plain facade, and columns and a
portico were not added for 27
years. Carnegie, built in 1906,
had an impressive — but unhar-
monious — gold dome which
was removed as part of the 1941
enlargement project.

Having been brought into ar-
chitectural unity with the Colon-
nade, however, both buildings
are included in W&L’s designa-
tion as a National Historic
Landmark, described by the

Department of the Interior in -

1972 as “‘this splendid succes-
sion of columned and pilastered

buildings . . . one of the most:

dignified and beautiful college
campuses in the nation.”’

W&L loses Invitational by one in O. T.
Also bows 67-61 to H-SC

by Bill Whalen

A funny thing happens inside
the Hampden-Sydney gym. Not
only do the walls close in on you
and the court seems to be
smaller, but some type of blind
rage overcomes the officials.
And we mean blind! Usually
this blindness occurs at the key
moment in the game, as it did
on Tuesday night when the
Generals visited H-SC.

With 62 seconds left, Pete

Farrell drove in for a layup and
collided with H-SC’s David Cor-
rigan. Farrell’s shot was good,
and the Generals trailed 61-60
when the refs decided that Far-
rel] had charged into Corrigan.
Instead of calling it an inten-
tional foul and awarding Far-
rell two shots (which was right
because Corrigan undercut
Farrell), the zebras gave Cor-
rigan two free throws, both of
which he made to put the game

 

THE

     

RING-TUM PHI

J.V. frosh;

tomorrow's stars

by Bill Whalen

At most colleges, the words
‘‘junior varisty basketball” are
synonymous with the words
“dead end.” A typical junior
varsity player is expected to go
no further in his career. At
W&L, however, j.v. basketball
serves a different purpose.

This year’s squad, coached by
Jim Casciano and Stan Packer,
consists of ten players. All ten
are freshmen, and_ their
development will determine
W&L's basketball success for
the next three years.

Casciano’s coaching aim is
not to build a powerhouse. In-
stead, his goal is to develop
these newcomers into varsity
potential players. This has
always been the duty of the j.v.
since Verne Canfield took over
the W&L basketball program,
and in recent years it has
played a major factor. Of the
five current starters on the var-
sity, three players — Tom Jef-
fries, Pete Farrell and R.J.

Scaggs — are j.v. graduates.
‘Five other players on the varsi-

ty roster have or are par-
ticipating with j.v. teams. In
all, that accounts for eight of
the thirteen men on the feam.
This year’s team is not
without stars, either. The

   

Students don't seem interested in the General's basketball team.

strength of the squad lies in its
starting five. Three of these five
— Travis Patterson, George
Spears and Clark New — also
double as varsity players. Since
all three are freshmen, they do
not figure into Canfield’s game
plans yet, so they get their play-
ing time with the j.v.

The other two starters are
also varsity prospects. They are
guard Chris Schrauth and for-
ward Craig Dye. Schrauth
averages 11.5 ppg while Dye
averages eight points. New is
the team’s leading scorer with a
21.5 point average. Patterson
and Spears both average 13.8
points a game.

The j.v. is 1-3 after four
games. Tuesday night’s 73-71
loss to H-SC was a good exam-

le of the j.v.’s problems. W&L
played well, but only in spurts.
The rest of the time, they made
clumsy errors. The team was
sloppy mainly because it was
their first game in five weeks.
And whenever the j.v. can prac-
tice, they must do so without
Patterson, New and Spears,
who are committed to varsity
practices first. Varsity basket-
ball may come first at W&L, but
j.v. basketball is an important
second.

Only an estimated 350-400 showed up to see Transylvania sink their

teeth into WAL.

ptt a line RIA! pace a Sis Rw eet

away at 63-60. As it was, this
call, plus several W&L
mishaps, sent the Generals to
their second consecutive loss,
67-61. W&L is now 8-5 overall
and 0-3 in the ODAC.

From the tipoff, the Generals
were fighting an uphill battle.
The Tigers jumped to an early
24-8 lead due to aggressive in-
side play. W&L countered with
some strong play by Tom Jef-
fries and Rob Smitherman, but
could only get as close as 32-26
before H-SC edged out to 35-26
at the half. ‘“‘We have to stop
getting ourselves into these
awkward positions,’’ said
Coach Verne Canfield. ‘“They
were too physical and ag-
gressive, and we did not res-
pond well to that.’’ By shooting
36% in the first half, the
Generals were in an early hole.

The second half was different,
though. W&L was able to close
to within four points at 39-35 and
46-42, but could get no closer un-
til they trailed 61-58 with 1:16 to
play. Then came the controver-
sial Pete Farrell play. H-SC hit
on four of six field goals in the
last 46 seconds. W&L could
manage only one free throw.
Jeffries led the Generals’ at-
tack with 20 points, 14 in the se-
cond half. Carby Hoy and Far-
rell each added 11.

W&L 86, Maryville 75

Pete Farrell’s 25 points and
Carby Hoy’s 24 paced the
Generals to an opening round
victory in the W&L Invitational,
last Friday night. The
Generals, who led at the half,
30-28, outscored the Scots 16-8
midway through the second
period to move ahead 70-59.
Farrell and Joy, who were held
to six and eight points in the
first half, combined for 35
points in the last 20 minutes.
The win sent W&L to the cham-
pionship game, where they fac-

ed Transylvania, 80-64 victors
over Ursinus in the preliminary
game.

Transylvania 63, W&L 62 (1 OT)

The Generals lost the cham-
pionship game in overtime to
Transylvania, 63-62, in one of
the most exciting games at
W&L in recent history. W&L
never led in the first half as they
fell behind 4-11, 16-23 and 30-36
at the half. The Pioneers led
47-36 with 16:23 remaining
before the Generals ran off

 

tional’s first round.

Hoy goes up for two against the Maryville Scots in the Invita-

eleven straight points to knot
the game at 47-all with 13:16
left. The lead changed hands
three times before Farrell hit
on one of two free throws with
five seconds left to send the
game into overtime at 56-56.
The lead shifted four times in
the five minute period before
tournament MVP John Hart
made a layup with 55 seconds
left. The Generals tried for one
last shot but Tom Jeffries’ ten-

,foot jumper was blocked and

Last Saturday the Generals
wrestling team return to ac-
tion after the Christmas
break by posting a 1-1 record
in a tri-meet here at the
Warner Center. W&L defeated
George Washington University
31-17 and lost to Duke 38-7. Duke
was the overall meet winner as

they also defeated George

Washington 33-ll. Two
freshmen, Mike McFadden at
150 and Clyde Gaylord at heavy
weight had 0-2 marks while five
other Generals had 1-1 records.
All of their: victories came
against George Washington.
Hank Wail at 126 and Ed Rogers
won by pin, Elbert Umila at 18
and Mike McKay at 134 won by
forfeit, while Dan Kniffen at 190
won 6-2. Two Generals also had
2-0 marks. Ray Gross had a
close 5-4 win against Duke at
142, while Ed Rodgers at a dif-
ferent weight class, had an
easier 8-0 decision at 158.

The Generals now have a

record of 1-2 and Saturday
travel to Charleston, S.C. to
play in The Citadel Invitational.

On Thursday, January 25, the
Generals host Lynchburg in an
important ODAC contest.

Swimmers win first

Washington and Lee’s swim
team captured its first victory
of the season; drubbing the host
Colonials of George Washington

Four W&L swimmers won
two events each: Captains Chip
Hoke (1000 & 500 meter
freestyle) and Keith Romich
(200 free & 200 fly), Drew
Pillsbury (200 medley & 200

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The death of

“grade review”

Last month, the Executive Committee unanimously
approved a statement that would give students ‘‘the
right to review and discuss all graded material and
any factor entering into the final grade’ in all
courses. This measure would have allowed students
to take their grievances to the proper department
chairman, who would be given the power to overturn
the professor’s grade if necessary.

As it stands, W&L has no ‘‘grade review’’ process.
The faculty has absolute autonomy in this matter, and
approval by that same group was necessary to make
the E.C. statement became law. It was no surprise,
then, that the E.C.’s approval of the statement was
mixed with general pessimism over its ability to pass
in a faculty meeting. (Beau Dudley said it was like

‘‘spitting in the wind.’’) And at last week’s faculty
meeting, any chance of effective grade review was
pretty mucheliminated.

A new statement, prepared by the Faculty Ex-
ecutive Committee, will be released soon. Students
with grade complaints are now urged to appeal to the
department chairman, after all efforts are made to
deal directly with the professor. The chairman may
act as a “mediator” of sorts, but cannot overturn the
professor’s grade decision. As one faculty member
put it, “‘the change is basically cosmetic...It signifies
that the faculty is sympathetic to the problems of cer-
tain students, but unwilling to surrender any of their
control.”’

In one sense, the faculty’s refusal to agree to some
sort of review process is most unfortunate. Students
with legitimate grade complaints still have no effec-
tive means of action against ‘‘administrative C’s”’
and the like. Unfair grading practices do occur from
time to time despite claims to the contrary. Even so,
we count ourselves among the many who sincerely
doubted the ability of ‘‘grade review’ to be ad-
ministered in a reasonable and fair way. All that can
be expected is that department chairmen will realize
they are the students’ only recourse — and that they
will offer as much aid as possible in their position as
the ‘‘middleman.”’

oe ok

The E.C.’s grade review plan may have been riddl-
ed with difficulties, but other measures proposed in
the same statement were obvious reforms which
should have been endorsed by the faculty. Specifical-
ly, they were requests for a syllabus at the beginning
of each course and an approximate grade percentage
for tests and papers. Many professors refuse to be
held to a schedule of assignments, and often have to
be pinned down to reveal their relative bearing on the
final grade. It is maddening to see that such a simple

duty cannot be performed by the entire faculty.
Proper information concerning the administration
of a course should be seen as the most basic of obliga-
tions to the student. Contrary to what some may
think, a syllabus is a requirement — not a gift.
Academic ‘“‘guessing games’? may be a faculty
favorite, but please try to keep them out of the

Manager of the Ring-tum Phi. Ap-
pointed by the Publications Board in
May, 1977, his first duty was to
oversee the change in printers from
the W&L Print Shop to The News-
Gazette. Added to this tremendous
responsibility was the need to ex-
pand the two-man business staff, in-
crease advertising, and promote
subscriptions.

These and other problems he at-
tacked with energy...and the results
have become an unqualified suc-
cess. The Phi’s advertising revenues
have more than tripled under Goss:
the same growth rate has been see).

this year. He will be missed, but w:
are pleased to note that he will rc
tain his seat on the Publication:
Board and will remain on th
business staff in an advisory capaci
ty.
On the recommendation of Goss.
the Publications Board appointed
Cove Geary to serve as Business
Manager for the remainder of the
year. As his successor to sworn in,
Goss commented, ‘‘It is always dif-
ficult to leave an organization with
which one has been so intimately in-
volved with for such a long period of
time. However, it is much easier to
depart knowing that the Ring-tum

Phi will be in such capable hands.”

his predecessor for a job well done.

Critical Year For W&L
Admissions, Hartog Says

(continued from page 2)
quality of the entering students
was better than expected.”’

Hartog said that the drop in
applications was -actually a
steady decline, but hit its lowest
level last year.

He cited three factors for the
drop in admissions: an essay in-
serted into applications, a tradi-
tional method of acceptances
and an unaggressive recruiting
policy.

The essay, he said, was in-
serted into last year’s applica-
tion, and is still the topic of
debate. Hartog said its effec-
tiveness has not yet been deter-
mined, but said that it chased
away not just marginal
students, but all students who
had mixed feelings about W&L.

Hartog said that the essay,
which he described as one way
to restrict ‘applicant flow”
really required “research done
by the student to be written
well.”

Traditional recruiting done
by Washington and Lee, said
Hartog, has always revolved
around the traditional centers
of high applications, such as

Baltimore, Atlanta and Dallas.

He said that with the declin-
ing number of potential ap-
plicants, the school must push
beyond these traditional areas
and intensify its recruiting ef-
forts.

To do this, the school has im-

reported.

“The IFC didn’t pick the

don’t think there was any
hanky-panky with the selection

Tom Salley, Contact’s other

rest of the year, the houses will
be randomly selected.”

Beau Dudley, EC president,
said that he ‘‘will attempt to get
independent exams in the law

independent exam system could
be ‘‘put into effect this spring.”

He said he would try to imple-
ment independent exams for all
three law classes, but he called
the examination schedule for
first year students ‘‘the most
equitable system there is.”

“Independent exams would
relieve a lot of pressure,”’
Jenelle Mims, EC law school

Another new key to W&L’s
stepped-up admissions is the
rolling acceptances, said Har-
tog.

Traditionally, candidates
were not informed of their ac-
ceptance or rejection until
March. By that time, said Har-
tog, they might have been ac-
cepted by another school and
‘lost interest’’ in W&L, whether
they were ultimately accepted
or not.

Under the new, rolling pro-
gram, a certain number of

‘students are told whether they
are accepted or rejected each
month.

VOLUME LXXVIII

Washington and Lee University

Lexington, Virginia, January 26, 1979

NUMBER 14

 

Computer Down—Again

Stuart Snyder-

Washington and Lee’s newest
computer, the Harris 125 went
‘“down’’ or out of service last
Friday, Jan. 19.

This was only the beginning of
at least five days of trouble.

On Saturday, the computer
went through its regularly
scheduled programming ses-
sion 8:00 a.m. to 12 noon;
however, it remained ‘‘down’’
until two o’clock that afternoon.

According to Dr. Thomas Im-
eson, Head of the Computer

Carrel Distribution

Center, during the next four
days it was down at least five
non-scheduled ‘‘down’’  ses-
sions, including: on Sunday 9:00

- a.m. to 11:30 and 2:00 p.m. to

3:00 p.m., on Monday 1:30 p.m.
to 3:00 p.m., on Tuesday 5:30 to
6:00 p.m. and finally on
Wednesday at 3:00 p.m.

The Harris computer has
been here since the Fall of 1977.
Since then it has been burdened
by malfunctions in “‘hard-
ware,”’ the physical machinery,
and ‘‘software,”’ the tapes, pro-
grams and operating systems.

Poses Problems

by Andy Pick

The visible problem confron-
ting the new University Library
has been the acquisition of
study carrels.

Instead of a_ reservation
‘method of distributing the car-
rels, the new library uses a
first-come, first-served ap-
proach. This method has led to
the stealing of carrels, students
assembling their own carrels,
and other less than honorable
schemes in what has been term-
ed ‘‘The Great Carrel Race.”’

Many students have gone so
far as to sit around the library
and wait for the workmen to
complete a carrel, and grab it
immediately.

According to students sear-
ching for carrels, the advantage
of a carrel is to eliminate lugg-
ing an armful of books around
all day, not to mention having a

private study area.

According to Maurice Leach,
Head Librarian, the main cause
of the situation has been the in-
ability of workmen to complete
the carrels because both the
carrels and the workmen come
from Pennsylvania and have

fallen far behind schedule due -

to bad weather conditions.

Roughly one-half of the an-
ticipated 560 carrels have been
installed. The remaining car-
rels will be installed within the
next two weeks, weather per-
mitting, Leach said.

When all carrels, study
rooms, and study lounges are
completed, the new library will
be able to accomodate approx-
imately one half of Washington
and Lee’s 1600 undergraduate
student body.

If the continued use of the
first-come first-served method
of distributing the carrels
causes any major problems, the
library will possible revert back
to the sign-up procedure of the
past, Leach said.

EC Gives
Cold Check

More Power

The Executive Committee
Monday night extended the Cold
Check Committee’s power to
fine in extraordinary cir-
cumstances.

Dick Schoenfeld, chairman of
the Cold Check Committee, ask
ed for the ability to fine ac-
cording to the magnitude of the
offense after his committee’s
recent experience with one stu-
dent who bounced 25 checks, but
could only be fined $10. In this
case, Schoenfeld felt that the
$10 fine would not be a sufficient

(continued.on page 20)

The Harris Corporation ser-
vice people, the ones who did
the repair work previously, are
currently trying to solve the
problem. According to Imeson,
the present problems cannot be
classified as either “‘hardware’”’
or ‘‘software.”

‘We are currently experienc-
ing more than our fair share’”’
(of problems), stated Imeson.

The Harris Corporation, as
yet, has not given an estimate of
when the computer will be
operable, stated Imeson.
However, the computer is
available for student use bet-
ween ‘‘downs.”

Last October, the Harris Cor-
poration conducted a thorough
investigation of the computer to
evaluate it and give recommen-
dations to the University.

A committee was to make a
decision on Harris’ findings and
the decision was to be made
public after the University had
chosen its course of action. Im-
eson said the results cannot be
made public at this time.

R ing-tum Phi Housing Series

 

 

The Victims in Lexington’s

Housing Game

by Randy Smith

Mrs. Linda Gordon, 34, has lived in the
small house at 10 Henry St. for 14 years.

But she and her four children will have to
move soon because she cannot afford to pay
the rent, which will be increased from $50 to
$310 a month.

Mrs. Gordon is divorced and her only in-
come is the $335 check she receives each
month from the welfare department.

She is at a further disadvantage because
she has never had a lease to protect her living
arrangement.

Last August, the owner of the property,
Patricia B. Fox, signed a contract to sell 110
Henry St. and a lot behind 109 Henry St. to
William.’ J,’.Stearns, Washington and Lee

University’s swimming coach, the following
year. Under the contract, Stearns was to pay
her $90 a month rent for one year, after which
he would buy the property for $11,750.

The real estate contract effectively gives
Stearns control of the property, so he began
renovating the house, inside and out, even
with the Gordon family living upstairs.

Stearns began by installing a new kitchen
downstairs, rewiring the entire house, and
painting the interior and exterior.

Tuesday ke and his workmen went into the
Gordon apartment and started poking holes in
the ceiling to install a new central heating
system. Mrs. Fox was surprised.

“He said that he wasn’t going to do

anything to her apartment for a year, ‘‘ she

Alumni

Committee

to Inspect Fraternities

by John Billmyre

On Friday, March 30, a three-
member Fraternity Committee
of the Alumni Board of Direc-
tors will be on campus inspec-
ting fraternity houses.

The Committee, headed by
Bob White, will report back to
the Alumni Board of Directors
at their meeting in May. The
Alumni Board of Directors has
direct access to the Board of
Trustees.

The inspection is the result of
a long term concern by many
alumni over the deteriorating
condition of fraternity houses.
According to Dean Lewis John,
the fraternities are coming
under closer scrutiny because
some alumni fear the present
conditions of some houses could
hinder or prevent support by
alumni and adversely effect ad-
missions.

Many alumni contribute
money to fraternities on an in-
dividual basis, but the fraterni-
ty system as a whole does not
receive alumni support.

John noted that inspection of
fraternities by alumni is not un-
common, and that the Alumni
Board of Directors made a
similar move two years ago.
Several alumni from the Alum-
ni Board of Directors randomly
inspected a few houses in a
casual tour this fall.

John also pointed out that the
condition of fraternity houses
affects all aspects of university
life.

According to Dan Murphy,
Assistant Dean of Students and
advisor to the IFC, “Our pur-
pose is to insure the exterior
maintenance and safety of the
fraternities.”

Murphy also expressed a
general concern for the overall
safety of houses. He mentioned
the fire at the ZBT house two
years ago and the fire at the
PIKA house last year.

The IFC gives each house a
checklist once a month. Failure
to comply with the list results in
social probation. ‘‘As long as
people come in advance to

Appeal

Social

Probation

by John Billmyre

Two of the three fraternities
placed on social probation last
week for non-compliance with
inspection standards appealed
their cases before the Student
Affairs Committee Tuesday
afternoon.

Sigma Phi Epsilon, placed on
probation for not having
emergency telephone numbers
next to a pay phone, had its
penalty repealed. Larry
Bryand, Sigma Phi Epsilon’s
president, told the SAC ‘“‘the
phone is never used’’ and that
the phone is located in an
“obscure place.”

Pi Kappa Alpha president
Frank Ellerby also appealed his
fraternity’s case before the
committee. Pika was charged
with having 7 cracked windows,
an empty fire extinguisher, and
a littered trash area.

Ellerbe did not deny the
charges, but appealed the case
because the probation would
have started immediately, and
PIKA has already paid a down
payment for a band for this
weekend. The Committee decid-
ed to let Pika ‘have the party
this weekend ‘and’ begin their
period of probation on Sunday.

Phi Gamma, Delta was also
scheduled to appeal their proba-
tion, but president Keith Van
Lanen said FIJI only wanted to
appeal the decision so that they

could hold a party this past
weekend.

So far six houses have been
inspected and four have failed
inspection.

Sigma Phi Epsilon has passed
inspection twice.

Sigma Chi was placed on
social , probation for having
several cracked windows. Since
their probation the rule has
been changed and cracked win-
dows are no longer considered
broken unless they are unsight-

ly.

discuss the problems, we are
flexible and helpful,’’ Murphy
said. This helpful policy will
continue as long as it is not
abused, he said.

While Murphy said ‘things
are moving in the right direc-
tion,”’ he also pointed out that
there is ‘‘a great deal to be ac-
complished.”’

University
Center

Committee

by Keith Leeper

The University Center Com-
mittee held its first meeting of
the Winter term on Monday,
Jan. 15, to discuss the bands
that will be booked in the
Cockpit for the next three mon-
ths. The committee decided on
the following:

Jan. 24, Sweet Briar’s Sweet
Tones and W&L’s Southern
Comfort; Jan. 26, Glenn
Phillips Group.

Feb. 3, Willie and Gene Nin-
inger; Feb. 14, Tasty Licks.

March 17, Old Hat; March 29,
Fiction Brothers.

These suggestions were taken
before the Student Activities
Board on Sunday night, Jan. 21,
and were unanimously approv-
ed.

In addition to these bands,
Burr Datz will be putting other
special entertainment in the
Cockpit periodically. All of this
insures that next term will see
plenty of good music.

The U.C.C. has committed ap-
proximately half of its remain-
ing funds on bands for this
term. Thus, funds are available
for other bands that come up on
short notice in addition to leav-
ing an adequate amount for Spr-
ing term. Anyone who has any
suggestions concerning bands
or type of music that they would
like to see in the Cockpit is
welcome to attend the weekly
meetings on Monday nights at 7
p.m.

 

 

 

 

 

 

“GESUNDHEIT”

Colonnade Fails
Spot Inspection

by Jimmy Olson

The occupants of several
buildings at Washington and
Lee University will be placed on
social probation for failing to
meet inspection standards.

The Hill Inspection Commit-
tee, a body made up of
students; found that five of the
six buildings spot-checked did
not meet up to standards on the
fraternity inspection lists. The
HIC decided to place the
regular occupants of those
buildings on social probation for
two weeks.

Newcomb Hall was found to
have no smoke alarms and at
least 11 cracked window panes.
Therefore, all members of the
Commerce School faculty will
not be allowed to congregate in
groups of more than five for
social purposes or have girls in
the buildings.

Payne and Washington halls
also had no smoke detectors
and Payne had seven cracked
windows. Faculty and staff in
those buildings are also on.

University Receives
$1,400:'Grant From

Sears-Roebuck Foundation

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity ‘has received an
unrestricted grant of $1,400
from The Sears-Roebuck Foun-
dation as part of a program
under which. $27,388 is being
distributed this year to 25
private calleges and univer-
sities in Virginia.

The grant to W&L was an-
nounced by E. O. Huffman Jr.,
manager of the Lexington Sears
store. The foundation’s gift will
be used to help pay W&L’s
general educational operating

expenses this year, and is part
of $1.1 million the university
must raise through its annual
fund and from business, in-
dustry and foundations to meet
its budget.

“The Sears Foundation has
been — and continues to be —
one of W&L’s staunch sup-
porters in the business com-
munity,” W&L’s Farris Hot-
chkiss, director of university
development, remarked.

“Washington and Lee is

grateful for this grant for three
reasons,’’ Hotchkiss said, ‘‘-
obviously for the tangible effect
it will have on our educational
program this year, but also for
the example it sets for local

business, and for the renewed:

confidence it expresses on the
part of one of the nation’s pro-
minent corporations in the im-
portance of private higher
education as represented by
W&L and by the other indepen-
dent colleges in Virginia to
which The Sears Foundation
has awarded grants.”’

several cracked windows; inac-
cessible fire extinguishers, and
no emergency phone numbers
by the pay phones.

The same rules applying to
the C-school and Payne and
Washington halls apply to all
freshmen and dorm counselors
living in the old dorm.

The new library was found to
have litter around the building
and no emergency numbers
near the phones. Since the
library move was done partly to
show the students that it is
“their library,” all those par-
ticipating in the move are
hereby placed on social proba-
tion.

Reid Hall passed inspection,
as it had fire doors, a sprinkler
system, no cracked windows,
accessible fire extinguishers,
and no public phones that need-

ed emergency numbers.
Those placed on social proba-
tion can appeal _ their

punishments at the next HIC
meeting at 12 Friday night on
the footbridge.

An HIC spokesman said that
he felt that it was equitable to
put the members of the faculty
on social probation because
their buildings are not subject
to as heavy use as fraterntieis
and because the school has
about 70 workers at Buildings
and Grounds to keep the
buildings in shape.

He added, ‘‘The students are
alarmed at the deplorable con-
ditions of deterioration of the
buildings on the Hill. The
students are concerned, and
may stop giving money to the
school. We hope these inspec-
tions can bring the buildings up
out of the slum conditins they
are now in. Personally, I’m

Frosh polled on career choices

Law, business and medicine
are once again the leading
career choices of Washington
and Lee University freshmen,
according to results of a survey
of entering students taken in
September under the auspices
of the American Council on
Education (ACE).

A quarter of W&L’s new
freshmen — 25.2 percent — said
they intend to become lawyers.
By way of comparison, the na-
tional average for male
freshmen at undergraduate col-
leges was only 6.5 percent.

A fifth of the freshmen — 20.3
percent — said they intend to
enter business. The national
men’s percentage was 16.0.

Medicine was named as their
career choice by 16.4 percent of
W&L’s 1978 freshmen, com-
pared with 6.4 percent national-
ly.

The statistics are taken from
survey data announced over the
‘weekend by the ACE. The
survey, which included 254

other four-year colleges across
the nation in addition to
Washington and Lee, was con-
ducted on the ACE’s behalf by
UCLA. Data were provided for
individual institutions and in
the form of nationwide
averages for comparative pur-
poses.

Law, business and medicine
have been the top career
choices among W&L freshmen
in every recent ACE survey.
This year, however.. the figure
for law dropped from _ its
customary  30-to-35-percent
level, and the percentage of
freshmen who said they were
“undecided”’ on a career rose to
16.4 percent in 1978 from the
previous year’s 11.1 percent.

The drop in law as a career
choice can likely be attributed
to widespread national publici-
ty about the glut of lawyers on
the job market in recent years,
W&L officials say. They noted
that even with the drop, the
figure for. W&L is four times the

national men’s average.

The figures for business and
medicine among Washington
and Lee freshmen this year
were virtually identical to the
W&L figures for each recent

year in previous ACE-
sponsored surveys.
Washington and Lee’s

“strong academic reputation’
was named by 86.5 percent of
the 1978 freshmen as a “‘very
important reason” in deciding
to attend W&L. Only 50.7 per-
cent nationally included that as
one of their ‘‘very important
reasons’ for choosing a college.
As usual, Washington and Lee
freshmen characterized
themselves as politically much
more conservative than their
peers at other colleges — 39.1
percent among W&L freshmen,
against 20.9 percent of male
freshmen nationally. Only 11.8
percent of W&L’s freshmen said
they regard themselves as
liberal, less than half the 23.9-
percent figure nationally.

W&L grads go to work

Data on: W&L’s 1978
graduates, also released this
week, indicate that fewer
students went immediately into
graduate school last year than
in other recent years, and that
‘more went directly into the job
market.

The W&L placement report
shows median starting salaries

for W&L graduates were up by

$1,000 this past year over the
two previous years.

The statistics were compiled
from questionnaires returned
by 251 of 301 graduates, for a
response rate of 83.4 percent.
The survey was conducted by
W&L’s Office of Career
Development and Placement.

Only a little more than a

quarter of the class of 1978 —
27.1 percent — _ entered
graduate study directly after
graduation, the report shows.
That percentage is down from
37.4 a year ago, and from 40.1
percent the year before that.

More graduates went directly
to work in 1978 than in previous
years — 62.7 percent last year,
against 56.6 percent in 1977 and
51.1 percent in 1976, according
to the report.

By late October, when the
survey was concluded, 10.2 per-
cent of W&L’s 1978 graduates
were unemployed, but the
report notes that all but two of
the unemployed survey
respondents either were. not
looking for work at all or had

Among those who went into
full-time graduate study, the
largest percentage, 12.3, were
in law school. Between 3 and 4
percent each were in business
school and medical school, and
slightly fewer than 8 percent
were in other graduate pro-
grams.

Mock Convention

by Syd Farrar

Mock Convention Chairmen
Sidney Simmons, Craig Cornett
and Dick Schoenfeld have been
interviewing candidates for the
Steering Committee and state
chairmen since Christmas
break.

There have been over 100 in-
terviews with about 40 inter-
views yet to be completed. The
interviews are necessary
because it is impossible to pick
the Steering Committee and
state chairmen just from the
applications.

Each applicant has received .

a 10-15 minute interview. Con-
vention tri-chairmen Sidney
Simmons reports that’ in
another week the interviewing
phase of the selection process
will be over.

The names of the applicants
will then be pooled and the
chairmen, considering both the
information on the applications
and the personal interviews,

will choose all the Steering
Committee members and ap-
proximately 35 of the state
chairmen.

The rest of the state chairmen
will be chosen next year from
freshman applicants and those
upperclassmen who have
developed a late interest in the
Mock Convention.

For those who fail to receive a

position, their named will be

given to the state chairman

.whose state they applied for so

that the state chairman can im-

mediately begin to recruit to fill -

the top positions in his own state
delegations.

In general, the response of the
applicants has been excellent.

There have been applicants
form every fraternity, in-
dependents and the law school.

The selections will be made
on the basis of ability. The
chairmen, however, will also
consider the need to attract a
diversity of the student body.

told the Ring-tum Phi.

But Stearns did not recall the verbal agree-
ment with Mrs. Fox. Nothing about Mrs. Gor-
don and her children was included in the writ-
ten contract.

“Linda was really the only holdback keep-
ing me from selling the property,’ Mrs. Fox
said. ‘I’m sad this has happened to her. I
didn’t think he was going to go on into her
apartment. She deserves better.”’

“It costs me $40 a month to leave her
there,’’ Stearns said. ‘‘If she had gotten out or
I had forced her to get out earlier, we could
have completed the job of renovating it and
increased the rent already, which would have
helped pay for it.

‘‘She had no lease, so I can give her a 30-day
notice (to leave the premises) ,’’ Stearns said.

‘“‘Would I do that? I told her three months
ago she would have to find another place by
Jan. 15, which has obviously come and gone.

‘‘She said she had no place to stay, so I said,
O.K., if you want to stay here, you can stay
here until June,’’ Stearns explained.

They would just have to ‘‘live around the
remodeling,” Stearns told Mrs. Gordon.

“I don’t feel that there’s anything we can
do,’’ Mrs. Gordon said. ‘‘I don’t have a choice
because I don’t have anyplace to move.”’

“All the houses I’ve found that are big
enough for us to live in are $250-300 a month,”
Mrs. Gordon said, ‘‘and I can’t afford that.”

She did find a place on Houston Street that
was $160 a month, but its heating system is
electric, and Mrs. Gordon did not feel she
could afford the rent, utilities bills, and still
feed and clothe her four children on just $335 a
month.

“It’s inconvenient, there’s no question
about that, but I feel that we’re doing her a
favor because she can stay there for the same
rent,” Stearns said. ‘“‘The rent will still be $50

a month and she can begin to take over the
whole house as it becomes available.”’

“Instead of paying for space heaters, she’ll
have a new central heating system,’’ Stearns
said.

‘‘When he finishes the heating system, then
I guess I’ll be heating the whole house,”’ Mrs.
Gordon, already worried about increased
heating costs.

“I'd move if I had someplace to put my fur-
niture, but you just can’t pick up and go with
four children,” Mrs. Gordon said.

Other Property

Stearns has other real estate in the Henry
Street area.

On Oct. 12, 1977, he began buying property
on the street with his purchase of 106 Henry
St. and two lots in Lexington Heights (Arpia
Street) for $13,000.

The 106 Henry St. house is now valued at
$19,000 and has a yearly city real estate tax
rate of $142.50, court records show.

Stearns rents the house for $220 a month
plus utilities on a 12-month lease. The house
has two bedrooms, a living room, dining
room, kitchen, and central heat.

On Dec. 19, 1977, he bought 107 Henry St. for
$13,000. The property is now valued at $27,600
and is charged $207 a year in city property
taxes.

Stearns rents 107 Henry St. for $325 a month
plus utilities on a 12-month lease. The house is
advertised as having five bedrooms, a “‘large
storage area in the attic,” and ‘‘a large
secluded lot.”

Stearns bought 108 Henry St. on May 9, 1978,
for $22,000, although its current value, as
stated in city records, is $19,200, with a city
real estate tax rate of $144.

The W&L swim coach rents this house out
for $390 a month plus utilities on a 12-month
lease. It is advertised as having six bedrooms
and “‘a large basement with two good sized
rooms and a half bath.”’

New Property

Just this past December, Stearns purchas-
ed two more houses in the area, at 8 Henry St.
and the house next to it at 104 Randolph St. He
bought both for $25,000.

Although he is still unsure exactly how
much money he will spend on their improve-
ment, he has already computed their rental
rates for next year.

The house at 8 Henry St. will rent for $190 a
month plus utilities on a 12-month lease. The
rent for that house is currently $90 a month
excluding utilities.

The house at 104 Randolph St. will bring
Stearns $375 a month next year. The combin-
ed rent paid by the tenants presently living
there is $205 a month.

Seven people now live in the big house at 104
Randolph St.

Mr. and Mrs. Paul Price and their two
daughters live in the basement apartment.

Price has been handicapped since birth and
collects disability payments of $480 a month.
His rent is $75 a month and he pays for his own
utilities.

Stearns “did not exactly” talk to them
about raising the rent, Price said. ‘“‘He said
something about after he had gotten a little
further along in fixing the house that he might
have to go up in the rent, but he didn’t set a
price,” he said.

Their new landlord also did not speak to
them about the repairs he would do to the
house.

About the middle of January, Stearns began
to paint the hallway on the first floor. He also
tore down the porch in the front of the house,
pulling down telephone wires and knocking
over the mailbox in the process.

(Section 5-7 of the Lexington City Code re-
quires a permit to dismantle a ‘“‘structure,”’
such as a porch. Stearns had no permit.)

(continued on page 5)

mT ste umm EN "yo

(continued from page 4)

The telephone wires and mailbox were not
replaced until Mrs. Martha Dale, who lives on
the second floor, notified Stearns. The re-
mains of what once was the porch can still be
seen beside the house.

“It would help if he cleaned-up the mess,”’
said Pete Sweet, who lives on the first floor
with his wife. (The Sweets pay $70 a month
rent, excluding utilities. )

“‘T asked him, ‘Do we have to move,’ and he
said, ‘No sir, I'd like for you to stay,’ “‘ Price
told the Ring-tum Phi.’’He said, ‘I’m going to
fix the place up, but I don’t know exactly what
I’m going to have to do with it. I’m going to
have to get some figures on what it’s going to
cost me’.”

‘And he said, After the place is fixed up and
I find out what it’s going to cost me, why I
may have to raise your rent some’ but he
wouldn’t say how much,”’ Price continued.

Stearns’ plans for 104 Randolph St. include
a new stone porch in the front of the house, a
new roof, and shutters.

Displacing People?

“The people who are in there now will have
first option (to rent) if they want,” Stearns
said.

“‘T assume that the people who are upstairs,
in particular, will probably not be able to pay
the increased rent, and I’ve had problems on
this because I think in my own mind, ‘Well,
am I displacing these people that don’t have
as much money as I’d like to see them have?’

‘And then I sit down and say to myself, ‘On
these particular houses there we had to pay
$25,000 on them’and we’ll be putting, I would
guess, between $10-15,000 in those, particular-
ly in 104 Randolph St.

Stearns has a

house is three different shades of white.

“So, if we add those up and I have, say,
$35,000 tied up in there, and I keep the rents at
the present level, you add up those rents and
attempt to pay off a $35,000 mortgage or get a
return on that income and you'd find you can-
not. :

“So my feeling is that if I cannot, and I try
to keep the rents the same way, then I’ve got
to take money from my own family, my wife
and child, to support people that I don’t know
at all,’’ Stearns said in an interview with the
Ring-tum Phi.

I can’t buy a piece of property like that
and leave it in those conditions, for them or
for anybody else. And for me to improve them
(the houses) the way I have to improve them,
I’ve got to charge more rent, or pay it out of
my own pocket, which I don’t have.

“T have a choice. I either don’t buy them
and leave them in the same condition they
were in, or I buy them and attempt to do
something like we're doing here—just
renovating that whole area, which I think is
going to be just a super residential area, and I
think there’s a need for it,’’ Stearns said. ‘I
just think it’s a neat area. It’s located close to
W&L, it’s near the historic area and it’s near
VMI.”’

will increase from $90 to $190 a month.

Mrs. Brown is bitter about the rent increase
which will force her out of her present home
when her lease expires in April.

‘‘The reason he (Stearns) is getting rid of us
is so he can put students in here who will pay
that much rent,”’ she told the Ring-tum Phi.
‘“They’re the only ones who can afford it.”’

Where will she goin April?

‘‘T have nowhere to go. I have nowhere to go
because I can’t pay it. I will have to move in
with some of my children and they have
families of their own,’’ Mrs. Brown said.

‘I’ve checked around in the ads in the
paper and the rent is $150 (a month) and you
still have to pay your utilities.

‘“My income has never been substantial
enough for me to buy this place: I wouldn’t be
able to make up the payments,”’ she said.

‘*My lease is up in April, and I figure that’s
when he'll (Stearns) come in and talk to me
about going upon my rent.

‘I’ve just got $178 coming in and if he goes
up on my rent, then I’ll have to move,”’ she
said. ‘‘Or I’ll be out on the street.”’

 

Inside, the light doesn’t work and the floor
under the toilet is so rotted through that the
tenants are worried it might fall through any

Taming’s wild history

 

Senior director Hunt Brown is
moving quickly with rehearsals
for The University Theatre’s
first production of the term —
Shakespeare’s fantasy about
courtship and marriage in
Renaissance Italy, The Taming
of The Shrew. The comedy will
be presented Friday through
Sunday, February 9-11 at 8 p.m.
in the Troubadour Theatre.

All members of the W&L
community are invited to at-
tend. Tickets are free, and
reservations may be obtained
by calling 463-9111, ext. 371.

One of Shakespeare’s earliest
comedies, Taming was compos-
ed between 1590-94. The story
centers on the bold Petruchio
(Stan Nolan), who comes to
Padua to find a rich wife — and
ends up marrying the ‘‘shrew”’
— Katharine (Maria Soltos).
Seeing in her the seeds of a fine,
compassionate wife, he pro-
ceeds to dicipline her in a
distinctive way. In essence, he
‘beats her at her own game,”
hitting servants, throwing
plates, launching into tantrums,
and so forth.

All the while, though, he
assures her that she is the lov-
ing and gentle partner. And by
the end, that very goal is reach-
ed. Unbroken in _ spirit,
Katharine has still learned to
care for others.

This play, certainly within the
realm of farce, is ‘patently
designed to be watched, not
read, full of game-playing and
visual humor. It’s perhaps the
most light-hearted of
Shakespeare’s comedies.”

And now, for a special com-
mentary on the play, the Phi is
pleased to turn this article over
to Dr. George W. Ray, W&L’s
own Shakespearian scholar...

Ibsen’s Nordic couple coldly

The Taming of the Shrew

The stage history of this
durable comedy has not been as
happy as Hunt’ Brown’s
welcome choice for his senior
thesis production. Early on,
many seventeenth and
eighteenth-century adaptations

- notably Lacy’s Sauny the
Seot (1667), Bullock’s and
Johnson’s identically-titled The
Cobler of Preston (1716),
Worsdale’s A Cure for a Scold
(17350, and David Garrick’s
afterpiece, Catherine and
Petruchio (1754) — established
the tradition of mangling the
Shakespeare original almost
beyond recognition (I will spare
my gentle readers the par-
ticularities of these atrocities),
a tradition which, said to say,
has continued until the present
day.

Nahum Tate’s perversion of
King Lear drove Shakespeare’s
tragedy from the boards for
over a century and a half, but it
is just as melancholy a fact to
contemplate that
Shakespeare’s Taming was not
seen on the London stage for
over 180 years after the

Restoration, until 1844 at the
Haymarket the Atlantic
in the Colonies the Garrick
alteration held sway _ until
Augustin Daly’s landmark
revival of 1887, still highly
regarded by stage historians
largely for the brilliance of Ada
Rehan’s Kate and John Drew’s
Petruchio.

I pass mercifully over the
enactments of this century, ex-
cept to note that Laurence
Olivier made his stage debut in
Taming (as Katherina) and to
observe that the impulse of

and plays guitar. Maybe we
should make that “the PLAYS
guitar,”’ because this guy ain’t
no ordinary guitarist.

Last year, he played the
Cockpit with his band, and peo-
ple were in awe, ‘cause this was
not an ordinary Cockpit show.
While he played, almost
NOBODY in the place talked
(not even attempting to seduce
local lovelies), in fact, they
seemed mesmerized by his
songs. He doesn’t sing, nobody
does, they just play, and their
Style is non-definable because
the music is like non other; it
flows. And it’s good.

He’s been compared to (hold
your breath. . .) Beck, Santana,
Allman, McLaughlin, Oldfield
and Hendrix, and Lowell
George of Little Feat calls him
“my favorite guitarist, bar
none.”’ He is truly creative, a
master of sounds that even syn-
thesizers cannot duplicate, a fu-
sion of jazz and rock that unites
in sensational melodies, and a
creator of a new musical style.
The man is intense. See him.

Because of contractual dif-
ficulties, the Glenn Phillips
band will play in the Cockpit for

free on Friday night, show time
at 8:30 p.m. There will be a
cover charge for all non-W&L
personnel of $2.00 on Friday.
Because student organizations
could not meet his monetary
needs for two nights, a cover
charge will be asked of W & L
students on Saturday night on-
ly, and this will be $1.00; $2.00
for nen-W & L. If you attend the
show on Friday, you’ll see and
hear just how good this man is,
and will be glad to pay him $1.00
for his art.

Tickets

Contrary to popular rumors,
tickets are still available for the
Nighthawks shows in the
Cockpit on Wed. Feb., 7. Burr
Datz has 200 tickets left for
EACH show — and is selling
these at Evans Dining Hall. The
last day for advance ticket sales
is Friday Feb. 2. Ticket prices
are $3.00 in advance, $4.00 at the
door for W&L students and
dates — and $4.00 in advance
and $5.00 at the door for all non-
W&L people. Those with tickets
to the first show only will have
to leave.

Musical Mainstream

by Mark Mainwaring

Heart

The popularity of Heart is
without question one of the fairy
tale rock success stories of the
seventies, a surprise exceeded
perhaps only be the left-field
debut commercial success from
Boston a couple of summers
back. Heart’s first album,
Dreamboat Annie, went
platinum, and the follow-up,
Little Queen, did the same.

Magazine sold one million
copies within three weeks of its
release in April, 1978, and the
band’s latest, Dog & Butterfly,
shipped gold on release. What is
it about Heart that helps them
sell so many records (and con-
cert tickets — they‘re appear-
ing at the Roanoke Civic Center
on Wednesday, Jan. 31)?

The uniqueness of a rock
group, fronted by two women,
no doubt has a lot to do with it.
Ann Wilson, Heart’s fiery, dark-
haired lead vocalist, composes
all of the band’s music with her
blonde, younger sister Nancy.
Though Ann never had any for-
mal musical training, she learn-
ed the essentials of playing
guitar, flute, and trumpet.

Originally, Ann wanted to
write and _ illustrate poetry
books, but after opting for a
musical career, she began play-

ing with a succession of Seattle
bands until become an integral
part of Heart in 1970.

Nancy Wilson, whose musical
taste runs in a more classical
vein, initially pursued studies in
art at a private Oregon univer-

   

and Robin Meredith

Nighthawks

The Nighthawks have been
described as everything from
“a slugging, blues-oriented bar
band based in Washington,
D.C.” to “‘the best blues band in
America today.’’ They’ve
toured with such people as Mud-
dy Waters and Southwide

HEART

Johnny. They’ve released five
albums on two small, East-
coast based labels, all of which
have received consistent raves
from such publications as

prison, and eventually escapes.

The first half of the movie is
interesting. The ironic cir-
cumstances of Hayes’ arrest,
the confusion and terror of both
he and the audience as his cap-
tors speak only Turkish, and the
conditions of the Turkish prison
border, are fascinating. But
flaws already appear: the ac-
ting of the Turks is, as far as I
can tell, good, but that of Hayes’
father can only be described as
stupid; and any time Hayes’
gets nervous they have his
heart thumping away loudly in
the background like Chinese
water-torcher.

As soon as Hayes fails to be
paroled and stops telling us
about Turkish prison and starts
talking about escape, the movie
plunges into the depths of
dullness. He has a five-minute
romance with a gay Swedish
prison buddy that culminates in
a shower (there’s more hot
water in Turkish prison
showers than at the R.E. Lee
Hotel!). His other two prison
buddies can best be described
as ‘drug damaged’’; and
Harvey Korman in a bad Carol
Burnett skit. The continued
over-use of Turkish becomes
annoying and confusing.

Deeper Pathos

It sinks further into the
pathetic after (follow closely
now) he’s transferred to a sec-
tion of the prison for the insane,
is visited by his girl friend who,
while visiting him in a small
visitors’ room, at his request,
unbuttons her shirt and presses
her drooping breasts against
the glass, and he escapes after
he puts on a guard uniform
after killing the warden. Pathos
becomes pathetic. At this point
he too knows Turkish so half of
the last half hour’s dialogue is
Greek to me.

I sould say that the music by
Giorgio Moroder, is the best
thing about the movie. It’s sort
of Munich rock done with
eastern instruments. I will buy

a soundtrack if I can.

I suppose the movie is a com-
mentary on the Turkish penal
system. But then again
everyone has known that their
prisons were horrible since long
before T.E. Lawrence publish-
ed Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So
it really doesn’t follow that we
should pity someone who is
caught red-handed with the
goods, knew the risks he was
taking, and received a co
aratively lenient sentence. You
get caught, you pay the price.

What bothered me most was
not only the self-flattery of the
epigram at the end of the movie
implying that because this
movie was shown at the Cannes
film festival the Turks are
negotiating a prisoner ex-
change, but also the moral con-
sequences. The Turks in
American prisons would have to
pay a higher price than the laws
at the time had required; mak-
ing an exchange, in effect, ex-
post-facto legislation.

Oh, and “shot entirely on
location in Malta’’ in case you
were wondering.

Walk into the incredible

country and r&b influenced
originals to covers of Elvis
Costello and Sam Cooke. What
all this means is that we can an-
ticipate one of the truly great
moments in Cockpit entertain-
ment when the Hawks hit Lex-
ington on February 7.

The granddaddies of the
small-scale blues renaissance
that has been building up in
America over the past five
years of so, the Nighthawks
have been either directly or in-
directly responsible for the re-
cent successes of such bands as
the Allstars and George
Thorogood and the Destroyers.

Mark Mainwaring and I were
privileged enough to see the
Nighthawks in a relatively in-
timate setting at the After Sun-
down Club in Blacksburg last
June, and I think I can speak for
Mark in saying that we were
positively overwhelmed by the
power of their stage _per-
formance (indeed, much as |
hate to say it, they made the
Allstars, who opened for them
on that particular evening, look
like rank amateurs in com-
parison).

The Nighthawks are to the
Chicago Blues what the Rolling
Stones once were to
mainstream rock’n’roll; they
do what they do better than
anyone else is doing it at this
point in time.

Recordings

As unbelievable as it may
seem, (and I know this is begin-
ning to sound at least a little bit
like a press release) their
recorded history is nearly as
brilliant as their live per-
formances. I hedge slightly
here because the one difficulty
the Nighthawks have ex-
perienced has been their inabili-
ty to transfer the power of their
live sound to vinyl.

Nonetheless, the four albums
they’ve released on Adelphi
(their first album, released on
the defunct Alladin label, is cur-
rently unavilable) have been as
varied and consistently ex-
cellent as many equivalent

provers”’ to tinker with the text
has not been often enough
resisted. Two ‘‘modern-dress”’
productions I have seen come to
mind. A VMT production in
Richmond a few years ago set
the play in New Orleans around
1900. If you envisage Petruchio
as Rhett Butler, Kate as
Scarlett O’Hara, and Biondello
and Tranio as Amos and Andy,
then you'd have loved it. As I
recall, a very busy set over-
whelmed what was left of the
text (the hack director began,
as so many before him, by cut-
ting the Induction).

The most recent travesty was
this season’s Royal
Shakespeare production
perpetrated in Shakespeare’s
own home town. The players
began by totally destroying the
set (admittedly a spectacular

 

coup de theatre) and then pro-
ceeded to wreck the play as well
by straining for every farcical
effect. The decision to double
Sly and Petruchio also obscured
the crucial equation between
Sly and Kate: that is Sly, the
tinker transformed into a lord,
is to the Hunting Lord of the In-
duction as Kate is to another
hunting aristocrat, the tutor-
tamer Petruchio. This,
however, is a Pedant’s quibble
alongside such dubious stage
business as Petruchio’s Fonzie-
like entrance on his Harley-
Davidson bike or the detonation
of the adding machine in the
dowry contest between the pan-
talone Gremio and Tranio-
Lucentio.

Fortunately, not all latter-day
directors have failed to heed the
text’s tacit warning against do-
ing ‘‘as I please.’’ I was lucky

enough in 1962 to see Michael
Langham’s luminous produc-
tion in Stratoford, Ontario (still
home of the best Shakespeare
repertory company on this con-
tinent) in which John Colicos
(better known to my children as
the “heavy” on ‘Battlestar
Galactica’) and Kate Reid
gave memorable portrayals of
the two leads.

So one out of three ain’t bad,
as the play itself suggests in the
final “‘obedience test’, and I
have high hopes of improving
my average soon. ‘‘Well, we’ll
see. Come...and let the world:
slip,” says Sly, referring to the
“pleasant comedy’? we now
happy anticipate. An easy com-
mand to obey, I hope, for at
least one out of three among
you.

guitar playing, she joined Heart
in 1974, after the band had
already achieved some regional
recognition.

Utilizing 13 years of acoustic
guitar playing experience, Nan-

guitar, blues harp, keyboards,
and vocals to her repetoire.

Other band members include

Roger Fisher on lead guitar,
Steve Fossen on bass, Michael
Derosier on drums, and Howard
Leese on keyboards and guitar.

Odd as it may seem on the
surface, Heart has been com-

Zeppelin, and in fact often close
their show with the Led Zep
classic, ‘‘Rock and Roll.’”’ In
any case, the band’s combina-

ballads with straight rock’n roll
should make for an interesting

A Taste of the Big Apple

by Parker Potter

In days of yore, Fancy Dress
was named after the exotic
costumes of its participants.
Black tie is today’s required at-
tire, so we still get fancy for
Fancy Dress. The _ best
costumes of all, though, are the
elaborate decorations of the
Student Center/Dining Hall by
the SAB. This year’s ‘‘Taste of
the Big Apple’”’ should be no ex-
ception. (To effect their magic,
the SAB will close the Student
Center Wednesday, Feb. 28, and
the Cockpit at 1 p.m. Friday,
March 2.)

After being drawn to the Stu-
dent Center/Dining Hall at the
appointed hour of 8:30 by a
searchlight, Mr. Fancy Dresser
and his date will notice the two
awnings leading to the two en-

trances, on either side of the .

dining hall. Upon entering Mr.
FD. will check his coat and find
himself in Central Park in
winter.

Underneath a dark blue
starlit sky, he will see several
leafless silver trees, lit from
below and with multitudes of
mini-white Christmas bulbs.
The park will also feature
several lamp posts and park
benches. Off on the horizon one
will see the skyline of New
York.

Plaza Hotel

Pressing onward, Mr. F.D.
will find himself in the lobby of
the Plaza Hotel, formerly the
Cockpit foyer. The lobby will be
decorated with wall sconces
and special chandeliers.

Suddenly Mr. F.D. notices an
outrigger canoe loaded to the
gunwahales with lush tropical
vegitation, hanging over the en-

trance to the Cockpit, which is
actually Trader Vic’s. Trader
Vic’s will be outfitted with tiki
candles, bamboo curtains,
authentic grass mats and a
‘“‘Let’s Go Native’’ mural
featuring tropical dancers. The
tropical rain forest effect will
be accentuated with green and
blue lights.

Shopping
District

Moving from Trader Vic’s
toward what once was Fairfax
Lounge, Mr. F.D. will pass
through the shopping district,
and Bloomingdale’s and Saks
Fifth Avenue in particular. Past

the stores Mr. F.D. will
discover Studio 54 where Fair-
fax once stood. Appearing in
this replica, authentically done
in black crepe paper, will be
Charlie Brown and his ‘“‘World
Famous Carolina Disco.”’
Charlie brings with him strobe
lights, neon display lights,
rotating mirror balls, sound ac-
tivated chase ligts, mirrored
walls, and special effects pro-
jectors.

Should the disco scene not be
exactly what Mr. Fancy
Dresser craves as his ‘“Taste of

duck out to the Student Center
library, have his picture made

 

 

TICKETS

Subway

Walking down toward the
E.C. room, Mr. F.D. will find
subway maps, advertisements,
white brick walls and big black
crayons, with which he will
leave his own graffiti on the Big
Apple.

The Village

Coming up from the subway,
Mr.F.D. finds the laid back
Greenwich Village scene
holding sway in the E.C. room.
Entertaining them will be the
Brazilian group, Minas.

Retracing his steps through
the subway Mr. F.D. can head
up the back steps where slides
of New York will be shown.
Upstairs, he will find himself on

authentic show posters. Down

R emembering Fancy Dress

“LEXINGTON, VA. —
They’re screaming bloody
murder here’ because
Washington and Lee University
has given up its Fancy Dress
Ball...

“Perhaps (one student sigh-
ed) it can be resurrected.”

The New York Times
1971

The early 1970’s were indeed
lean years for one of W&L’s
strongest traditions— the Fan-
cy Dress Ball. After decades of
popularity, students seemed
more concerned with attacking
any tradition — beloved or not.
Only a few helped keep the
flame burning. (For example,
in this period one person ran in
the W&L student elections for
Fancy Dress President, and his
campaign posters featured a
picture of a little boy and girl
holding hands. The caption was
“What Kind of World Will We
Leave Them? Help bring back
Fancy Dress.’’ The candidate
lost.)

Luckily, after three years of
banishment the student body
again began to yearn for the
lavish decorations and black
ties. The old Dance Board —
with its hierarchical traditions
— had been turned into an open
student committee, the Student
Activities Board. And from the
first year of the ‘‘restoration,”’
when the theme was Mardi
Gras, this group has outdone
itself in presenting the highlight

of the W&L social calendar.
Fancy Dress may be “big
business” now, but its origins
date from a mere 47 dollars and
an imaginative librarian.
Sometime during the 1906-07
academic year Miss Annie Jo
White, W&L’s popular librarian
and part-time drama instruc-
tor, directed a play earning that
phenomenal sum. It would be
fun, she decided, to spend it all
on an elegant dance for the
students. A “bal masque’’...a
fancy dress ball! What could be
more original? She did most of
the costume arranging and
ballroom decorating, and in-

 

vited 40 couples to participate
on the memorable night of
February 12, 1907.

The ball grew quickly. So
quickly, in fact, that by 1909, it
had to be moved from the W&L
gymnasium to the ‘‘skating rink
on Main Street”’ (?!), where it
was held for several years.
Reports in 1913 said that ‘‘the
largest assemblage of college
girls ever seen in Lexington‘ —
some 300 — attended the ball.
Accompanied, we might add, by
“three lady instructors’ who
were to be chaperones.

These early years of Bal Mas-

corner to Radio City Music
Hall, which usually sees service
as Room 114, to catch a movie.

Impatient to hit the dance
floor, Mr. F.D. and his twinkle-
toed date make for the Dining
Hall by way of the Windows of
the World, atop the World Trade
Center, located in the side din-
ing rooms. Visible on all sides
will be the skyline of New York.
As well, thousands of ‘I Love
New York’’ bumper stickers
will be taped to the walls, free
for the taking.

Waldorf

Ballroom

And finally, Mr. F.D. gazes
upon the crowning touch of the
evening. Lester Lanin and his
band playing in the ballroom of
the Waldorf. Attached to the
columns will be floor-to-ceiling
white curtains, and hanging
from each column will be a
silver chandelier. Between the
columns will hang eight 8-inch
mirror balls. Up in the gallery
will be garlands of lush tropical
vegetation (presumably the
overflow from Trader Vic’s).

Hanging behind the band will
be a painted cloth backdrop,
depicting the ‘Great White
Way,” produced by Peter Wolf
of Dallas, designer of the stage
settings for Broadway’s present
revival of The King and I.

Completing the scenario,

by Dick Barron
This year, the SAB has
selected the Lester Lanin band

 

for the Fancy Dress Ball as the
headline act. This world
renowned band will appear in
the Letitia P. Evans Dining hall
from 8:30 to 12:30 p.m. on Fri-
day, March 1. Lanin’s music
has been described as ‘‘the beat
heard round the world.”’ In-
deed, in its over 30 years,
Lanin‘s band has appeared
before every President from
Truman to Ford at inaugural
balls and other special occa-
sions. Lanin is a favorite of the
British Royal Family, and was
once given the Royal salute by
the queen Mother. Other world
officials have sought Lanin for
their banquets and debutante
balls.

A factor enhancing Lanin’s
popularity is his practice of
varying his program to suit any
occasion. This means that the
Royal Family might hear sets
of continuous music suited to
their tastes, while the slightly
less dignified guests at the Fan-
cy Dress Ball might get, shall
we say, a program suited for
just about anything.

Rock Influence

In 1956, realizing the rising in-
fluence of rock music, Lanin ad-
ded guitars to his Big Band
sound A move which proved un-
popular with the more tradi-
tional society circles. Yet, this
was in keeping with Lanin’s
desire to stay ‘‘several steps

father, founder of the first In-
ternational Orchestra, gave
Lanin much of his philosophy of
music, urging him to develop a
style that was ‘‘distinctive and’
recognizable.”

His recordings include ‘‘Les
at the Tiffany Ball,’’ which was
recorded in 1959 at the Vander-
bilt estate in Newport.

The Lester Lanin Band will
appear throughout the evening
in the ‘‘Waldorf Astoria
Ballroom” at the Fancy Dress
Ball. The Band’s cosmopolitan
flair should create the perfect
mood for this year’s New York
Theme.

Further entertainment...

In addition to the headline
performers, this year’s Fancy
Dress will feature several
smaller, but none the less, ex-
citing acts.

The E.C. Room, disguised as
Greenwich Village, — will
showcase the exciting sounds of
the Brazilian group, Minas.
Minas is a group which should
be very familiar to Washington
and Lee audiences, after their
Lexington debut last spring,
and there return engagement
last weekend.

- In the E.C. Room the Fancy
Dress goer will hear authentic
Brazilian music and its emo-
tional mixtures of flowing and

fancy freebies

In the spirit of Fancy Dress,
the SAB will make available a
number of souvenirs com-
memorating the year’s Taste of
the Big Apple.

Following the popularity of
last year’s souvenir coins, Van
Brook of Lexington, Ky.,
(minter of similar com-
memoratives for the Olympics)
has been commissioned to pro-
duce this year’s. version.
Available free at the door, this
year’s coin (pictured
elsewhere) features the skyline
of New York and the ‘‘Taste of
the Big Apple” logo on the front.
The back will bear the same
design as last year’s coins. Like
last year’s coins, this year’s will
be of a gold finish.

As well, the SAB has ordered
twice as many grain cups as
they did last year. These every

popular cups, available like last
year at three for $1, are
decorated with the New York
skyline in maroon and blue, ona
white background.

The New York State Depart-
ment of Commerce and the Port
Authority have provided for
free, several thousand “I Love
New York’’ bumper stickers
and buttons to be distributed at
various locations throughout
the Ball.

Finally, Fancy Dress posters
will be sold by the SAB.

So, even if the worst should
happen and you wake up Satur-
day morning so hung over that
you can’t remember the night
before, your sourvenir coin,
grain cup, bumper sticker, but-
ton and poster should be of
some help in piecing together
the wonders of your ‘‘Taste of
the Big Apple.”

exciting thythms. Especially
for the ball this year, one can
expect to hear the energetic
drive of Brazilian carnival
music, with its demanding per-
cussion is a special blend of
African and Latin American ex-
pressions.

Minas is known for the energy
they produce at each per-
formance, and it seems only
right that they should join in
this most festive occasion.

As mentioned elsewhere, for
our “Taste of the Big Apple,”
Fairfax Lounge will become the
noted disco, Studio 54. No disco
is complete without its raison
d’etre, as pulsing disco beat.
Our Studio 54 will be powered
by the sounds produced by
Charlie Brown and his World
Famous Carolina Disco.

Through his impressive
stereo system, Charlie sends
out a widely varied repertoire.
Beach and rock music are amp-
ly represented on Charlie’s play
list but his specialty is Funky

   

 

and Disco music. The disco
sounds of the Commodores,
Heat Wave, Donna Summer and
the Bee Gees, to name a few,
will, like Charlie’s famous light
show, bounce around our own
little Studio 54.

As if this wasn’t enough,
entertainment is planned for
Trader Vic’s in the Cockpit, as
well. Negotiations fell through
with the Charlotte Steel Drum
Symphonette, but an even more
pleasing entertainment has
been planned.

Somewhere among the lush
tropical vegetation and the
“‘Let‘s Go Native”’ mural will be
a crew of Polynesian dancers to
pleasantly accent the tropical
motif.

So if the crunch in the main
ballroom becomes too much,
the smaller alcoves of the Stu-
dent Center will provide op-
portunities to get mellow, in the
Village, to get down in the disco,
or go native with Trader Vic
and his Polynesian delights.

 

Fancy Dr
The Arabi

by Parker Potter

Fancy Dress is one of Washington and Lee’s
great traditions, often referred to as the
“premiere collegiate sSouth.”’ As steeped in
tradition as W&L tends to be, it is then a bit of
a shock to see some of the changes which have
taken place concerning Fancy Dress...

The year is 1929, the end of the roaring ’20’s,
just before the Big Crash. The week before
Fancy Dress, in an issue of the Ring-tum Phi
which praises fraternities for reducing the
amount of ‘heavy beating’’ inflicted on
“goats,” which even made padding un-
necessary in some cases(!), the upcoming
festivites are described:

Doremus Gym was the scene of the ball en-
titled “The Arabian Nights,” with music by
Ted Weems and his Victor recording or-
chestra, fresh from an engagement in Cincin-
nati at the Gibson Hotel.

Quoting: ‘The main figure will be led by
T.G. Gibson and Miss Sophia Dunlap from
Mobile, Ala., assisted by E.H. White and Mrs.
White (presumably not his mother, -ed.).
Miss Dunlap who will take the part of
Sheherazade, the cunning wife of the Sultan
Shahryar, will be brought in on a gold litter.
Four freshmen have been chosen to act as
slaves.”

Further, the 1929 article states that ‘‘Miss
Eleanor Fry will give a special dance as a
slave girl.’ One wonders...no photos of this
“‘special”’ dance itself have ever been found...

But seriously, the 1929 Phi makes this an-
nouncement: ‘‘The first figure practice was
held Wednesday night. There will be another
practice Thursday night after the basketball
game.” Practice for Fancy Dress? It only
goes to show that in some instances change
can be a good thing.

On to the ball itself. In 1929 Fancy Dress

was the climax of the ‘“‘Mid-Winter Dance
Set.”’ Another large event of the set was the
Junior Prom held the night before Fancy
Dress Ball. Like today, other smaller enter-
tainments clustered around Fancy Dress.
Among these less formal events were a dan-
sant held jointly by the Phi Gamma Delta and
Beta Theta Pi fraternities from 11 a.m. until 2
p,m. on Friday, Feb. 22, the day of Fancy
Dress. At this fete ‘‘light refreshments were
served.”” From 3-5 p.m. Phi Kappa Sigma
held an open house featuring punch. Punch
was substituted for the originally planned
libation, tea.

That night 2000 revelers in costume entered
the palace of King Shahryar of Persia,
formerly Doremus gym. Decorations for this,
and all other social functions were handled by
Mr. Carl E.L. Gill, an associate professor of
Economics and Business Administration in
the Commerce School. (Dean Atwood take
note...)

Apparently Mr. Gill had a marketable
talent because “‘other schools have tried to
secure the services of Mr. Gill in decorating
for their dances but to this time he has spent
his efforts only on Washington and Lee func-
tions.” Mr. Gill’s efforts were apparently suc-
cesful, judging by the high attendance that
night in 1929.

One of the opening events of the ball was a
preliminary figure in which Lewis Powell
(who has since found his way to the Supreme
Court) and Miss Sally Barnet portrayed im-
portant figures in the Caroline period of
American history.

The highlight of the evening was the main
figure. “The Arabian Nights” figure ap-
peared later with King Shahryar on his throne
surrounded by his court. Sultana Sheherazade

Circus Tricks

Clowns in Ringling Brothers
Barnum and Bailey Circus have
used tricks designed for them
especially by Fabjance.
Likewise, his tricks have been
used at Six Flags parks and in
the Ice Capades. Fabjance has
also been a senior assistant to
the respected magician, the
“Original Blackstone.”’

Magic Teacher

Fabjance, living in Illinois, is
noted as a teacher of magic and
manages his own magic shop in
Bethalto, Illinois.

John Fabjance — described
as “a unique entertainer— not
just another magic act’’ will ap-
pear at the Fancy Dress Ball in
the T. V. room of the student
center, hopefully mystifying
W&L gentlemen and_ their
dates, adding that magic touch
to their “‘Taste of the Big Ap-
ple.”

Radio City Music Hall comes to Lex.

As the Lexington community
recovers from the astounding
success of THE GREAT MOVE
a few short weeks ago, plans
are being made for GREAT
MOVE II — the relocation of
New York’s fabulous Radio City
Music Hall. GREAT MOVE II,
which will be completed in ear-
ly March just in time for Fancy
Dress 1979, will see the famed
music hall move to the Early-

Fielding Student Center of
Washington and Lee.

Film Program

Although only a temporary
move, move director Jim Hicks
has assembled a special two
hour film program for Radio Ci-
ty’s Lexington premiere. Led
by Oscar Winner Bugs Bunny,
the star-studded cast includes

 

the Road Runner, Daffy Duck,
Speedy Gonzoles, Tweety and
Sylvester and the incredible

Pink Panther.

Trek Blooper

Special guest appearances
are scheduled by William
Shatner and Leonard Nimoy
who will appear as Captain Kirk
and Mr. Spock in the STAR
TREK bloop.er reels, a collec-
tion of goofs from the hit televi-
sion series. Other short films in-
clude Coney Island, a humorous
interpretation of New York’s
fabulous amusement park; The
Hero, a fast-paced comedy
about a fat (but loveable) slob
who trys to pick up a gorgeous
young lady; Destination: Big
Apple, a quick tour of New York
at night including Times Square
and Broadway; an academy
award winning film, The World
of Kids, and the all time classic
Bambi Meets Godzilla.

Rockettes

Also being planned are a
special feature on Radio City’s
own Rockettes and a salute to
selected Broadway shows in-

cludingA Chorus Line, Annie,
Grease, and The Wiz.
According to Mr. Hicks, all
visitors to Radio City on March
2nd will receive a special gift.
As this special premiere is ex-
pected to draw large crowds,
the special two-hour show will
be shown’ continuously

throughout the evening and all
attending the Fancy Dress Ball
are invited to attend free of
charge.

que were not adorned with set
themes. A couple dressed as
George and Martha Washington
generally led that year’s
““figure.’’ Then, in 1916, the im-
mortal Reuben A. Lewis
entered the ballroom dressed as
Louis XVI. His Marie An-
toinette? Miss Annie Jo, of
course. The first theme ball,
that of Versailles, was born.
This practice has continued un-
til the present time.

By the 1930’s, Fancy Dress
was an institution of national
importance. A few of the
highlights of that time...Walter
Winchell introduces the Fancy
Dress Ball over radio in 1932, on
the Lucky Strike nationwide
network hookup...Miss Annie Jo
continues to appear, and poses
for a photo in Life in 1938...The
big bands clamor to appear,
and they all did — Benny Good-

man, Eddie Duchin, Kay Kyser
and his “college of musical
knowledge,”’ Duke Ellington,
Count Basie, Jimmy Dorsey,
and more...Hundreds of girls —
from New Orleans, Atlanta,
Louisville, Charleston,
Baltimore — charter entire
railroad cars to come to Lex-
ington. It’s not hard to see, after
all this, why the “grand old
lady”’ of college weekends was
so easy to revive.

And it has done just that.
From the modest beginnings
with 1974’s Mardi Gras, the SAB
has transported us all to the sw-
ing era, Hollywood, Paris,
Egypt — and now, New York Ci-
ty. A male without black tie is
an oddity, though many costum-
ed shieks and harem girls were
seen at last year’s Egyptian
ball. Maybe this spells hope for
a restoration of Fancy Dress in

its literal sense — elaborate
costumes and all. But in any
event, it is doubtful that we will
see obituaries (such as the
following one written in 1971 by
James S. Wamsley, ’50) in the
near future:

“In its time it was fun...It
seemed in its time to have
class...It would be idiotic to ex-
pect modern collegians to find
the joy we did in a recreation of
King Arthur’s court, broadcast
live...But sometimes I wonder if
they’re having as good a time.

“And as we go down the road
to relevance together, a few of
us will wave briefly as we pass-
ed the locked and shuttered
ballroom that was Fancy
Dress.”

Idiotic? Not at all — the few
mourners have been replaced
by hundreds of new followers
for whom “‘class”’ is as vital as
ever.

was brought before the ruler on a litter borne
by four Nubian slaves. Sheherazade placed
herself at the Sultan’s mercy as he intended to
kill her.

‘“‘Music from the composition Sheherezade
by Rimsky-Korsakov was played by Ted
Weem’s orchestra while the theme progress-
ed. The pantomime and figure lasted 45
minutes.”

Fancy Dress Jazz

This year’s Phi is far from the first to print
a retrospective of Fancy Dress. The 1929 Phi
had this to say: ‘When Jazz became the
popular syncopation of Broadway the pro-
moters of Fancy Dress became exceedingly
modern and hired a negro orchestra to give
dancers a taste of the new rag-time.”’

Editorial Comments

Finally, the week after Fancy Dress an
editorial concerned with neglecting George
Washington’s birthday (another big February
event) began “Fancy Dress — Girls —
Costumes adorned with frills and fripperies —
silk and fur — satin slippers that leave tiny
heel prints in the snow — high pitched voices,
careless, joyful, music.”’

Oh for an occasionally frippery — or the
sight of the Commerce faculty hanging
streamers in the dining hall.

 

 

 

 

Though there was a concern for the neglect of George Washington’s birthday in 1929, there should be no
fear of that doday. In fact, several years ago, some generous soul made sure old George was ready for
Fancy Dress.

at last week’s Founders’ Day —
ODK Convocation was an old
and true friend of W&L. Dr.
James G. Leyburn, who came
to the university as dean of the
College in 1947 (and remained
here as a professor until retire-
ment in 1972), appeared before
a crowded audience and spoke
on a favorite subject — the
‘‘Washington and Lee ideal.”’
The Ring-tum Phi is pleased
to reprint sections of the text of
Dr. Leyburn’s speech. He
speaks about traditional values,
yet through his words the
message is, to quote President
Huntley, ‘forever new.”

It always delights me to
return to Washington and Lee,
and I am especially happy to be
allowed a part in this Founders’
Day and ODK Assembly. W&L
has absorbed a good part of my
life and thoughts and affec-
tions; and as you will see from
my remarks, ODK expresses
many of the ideals I have long
cherished for this University.

My acquaintance’ with
Washington and Lee goes back
to my ehildhood, with my
father’s stories about his
undergraduate days here, and
with visits to Lexington, which
had long been the home of the
family. I was struck, even in
those childhood days, by what
seemed to be an _ intangible
quality that pervaded the cam-
pus, as if some indefinable

 

idea that at birth an individual
acquired a kind of attendant
spirit — they called it agenius —
which protected him through
life and which gave him the uni-
que qualities of body and mind
which he possessed. By exten-
sion, they conceived that each
of their important localities and
institutions — the Senate, for
example — had its genius loci.
This “genius of the place’’ was
compounded of its physical ap-
pearance, the distinctive im-
pression it made upon visitors
to it, but more importantly its
way of inspiring affection and
loyalty, its curious quality of
demanding that one work to
make it uniquely great.

To me, W&L has such a ,

genius loci that gives it a quali-
ty which distinguishes it from
every other university. No one
could, after five minutes on this
campus and an observations of
its students, mistake W&L for a
state university or for Notre
Dame or for Georgia Tech. It is
not merely that our campus is
different from theirs, that we
have our special traditions, that
our curriculum is our own,
thatour athletic program is not
the same.

Who can say what has gone
into the creation of the genius of
this place that makes us love it
and recognize its uniqueness?
Our “genius loci’ is compound-
ed of the beauty of the Colon-
nade under snow on a moonlit
night, of sunset behind House

longer recognize.

On the day in which ODK
honors those who have made a
distinctive contribution to the
university I suggest that
Washington and Lee’s genius
loci, like the god Janus, looks in
two directions: backward to our
great heritage, and forward to
our expectations for the future.
It is to the future that our motto
points: non incautus futuri. If
we are truly to be “‘not unmind-
ful of the future,” it might be
well to clarify our hopes for the
university. With diffidence, I
suggest two ideals I have long
cherished for Washington and
Lee.

The first of these ideals is that
of excellence — and I am sure
that all of us would
acknowledge the validty of such
an ideal for a first-rate universi-
ty like ours. But the excellence I
have in mind is of a different
quality from that ordinarily im-
plied by the word. I resort again

‘to classical antiquity.

By common consent, the
Athenians of the fifth century
B.C. reached a pinnacle of
achievement. Within q few
decades (actually only about
tWo generations) the small city
of Athens, not as large as Rich-
mond, produced such men as
Themistocles and Pericles,
Socrates and Plato, Aeschylus
and Sophocles and Euripides,
Phidias, Aristophanes, and
dozes of others whose names
ring down the centuries. How

Leyburn, Calvert speak at ODK Convocation

 

Dr. James G. Leyburn addresses a packed Evans Hall on “the
Washington and Lee ideal.”

and the ideal had overtones and
undertones far richer than the
ordinary meaning. From the
outset, the school boy in Athens
was made to realize that it was
never enough to be pretty good;
he must strive to excel, and in
every part of his curriculum.

“Our genius loci is compounded of the beauty of the Colonnade under snow

on a moonlit night, of sunset behind House Mountain, of the Honor System,

of great teachers and their courses, of long hours in the library

boning up for tests and exams, of Fancy Dress, of victories (and defeats)

on Wilson Field and in the gym, of going down the road...”

 

spirit hovered about the place
and the people who pass
through its halls. I hasten to
remark that I am by no means a
mystic (who ever heard of a
mystical streak in a bluestock-
ing Presbyterian?). But I am
not alone in sensing this in-
definable quality of which I
speak.

In classical antiquity, that
most practical and hard-headed
of people, the Romans, held the

Mountain, of the Honor System,
of great teachers and their
courses, of long hours in the
library boning up for tests and
exams, of Fancy Dress, of vic-
tories (and defeats) on Wilson
Field and in the gym, of going
down the road, of pride in
Washington and Lee’s
academic standards — indeed,
of 230 years of accumulated
tradition built up by men whose
names most of us would no

could all this happen? Not, I
think, because of some sudden
miraculous combination of
genes in its citizens, but chiefly
because the Athenians had a
clear ideal to strive for, one in-
culcated into every youth from
the moment he started to
school. The Greek word for this
ideal was arete, and the dic-
tionary blandly defines this
simply as ‘‘excellence.”’ For the
Athenians, however, the word

Now for my point; how could
all this glory come to pass
within a few decades? Not by
some transcendent miracle;
nor do I believe for a moment
that these Athenians had any
better minds than ours. I am
certain that Washington and
Lee men are quite as intelligent
as Athenians of the fifth cen-
tury, quite as quick and
capable. They made an im-

perishable name for themselves —

and for their little city because
they exercised their minds and
creative imaginations to the
fullest, not content to be merely
good in a single field. Why
should this Washington and Lee
community not become the
Athens of America? Can we
truthfully say that our
Washington and Lee ideal of ex-
cellence has so touched our
minds and hearts that every
man here feels the compulsion
to excel in many areas, to open
his mind to new ideas and seek
out knowledge about what is un-

familiar to him?
I have always felt disap-
pointed that many W&L

students so soon begin to
specialize that they miss the
riches of this University’s
superb curriculum, and that
other students seem so intent on
grades that they refuse the

challenge of difficult courses. I
believe I should say that the
besetting sin of Washington and
Lee students is their conven-
tionality of mind — their will-.
ingness to follow accustomed
paths instead of launching out
into the unknown.

I am struck by a curious
phenomenon: that there always
seem to be many more eccen-
trics on the faculty and staff
here at W&L than there are
among the students half their
age. Why should this be? We
certainly encourage incipient
scholars and financiers and
businessmen; but I think the
University would be healthier if
more students left those beaten
tracks. Oddballs are not com-
fortable for administrators and
teachers; nevertheless, I wish
students on the campus more
frequently caused some flutter-
ing in the dovecotes of the
sedate.

Or again, I know how many
honors theses are produced and
that is fine; but why does the °
University not seem to
stimulate other and less con-
ventional forms of originality
and creativity? Where are the
Washington and Lee poets and
novelists, our composers and
painters and sculptors in this
country, for example? Have we
narrowed down the ideal of
arete to make it conform to the
values of a job-getting career?

The second ideal I chierish for
Washington and Lee — and here
I draw upon the French
language of chivilry and
feudalism — is that of noblesse
oblige. It was a recognized part
of the code of a nobleman that
he must undertake obligations
for those weaker and _ less
privileged than himself. Nobili-
ty obligates! No law required
this duty: it was _ simply
understood that, in the very *
nature of things, those who have
power must protect those who
are weak, those who have
means must care for the needy,

THE

 

RING-TUM PHI

Once again, W&L

loses a close one

by Bill Whalen

Any steady viewer of our
Generals should be noticing a
new trend in their games. W&L
is gradually losing its killer in-
stinct. Tuesday night’s game, in
particular, is a good example.
Of the nine games this year in
which the final margin has been
Six points or less, W&L has won
four and lost five. More im-
portantly, the Generals have
lost the last three of these
games.

This trend really started with
the Transylvania game of Jan.
13. The Generals were able to
stay within one or two points,
but every time they had a
chance to take charge, they fail-
ed to produce. This game
resulted in a one-point overtime
loss. Against Hampden-Sydney
on Jan. 16, the Generals fell
behind by as many as 16 points,
only to close to within one point
and then fold. This game ended
up in a six point loss. Finally,
against Gettysburg, W&L led by
margins of anywhere from one
to six points, only to end up los-
ing by three. These three losses
leave a serious question — why

can’t the Generals win the close
ones?

To quote Coach Verne Can-
field: ‘‘When we go up by a few
points, we fall asleep. What we
need are our experienced
players to be helping out, which
right now they aren’t.’’
Whenever the Generals are in
need of a key basket, their pat-
terned offense falls apart and
they turn into a group of one on

- one artists. On Tuesday night,

for example, when they trailed
by two points with ten seconds
left the Generals set up for one
last shot. Instead of moving the
ball, Pete Farrell took the in-
bounds pass, dribbled twice and
launched an off-balance, 23-foot
fade-away jumper — which is
not your basic high percentage
shot unless you’re a Harlem
Globetrotter.

To erase this ‘‘choke’’ label,
Canfield plans to go back to the
basics of basketball. “‘The team
must mentally play well to
win.’’ When asked how long his
team will work to get mentally
prepared, Canfield offered this:
“We'll practice until we’re
ready.”

Bowling alley - one of a dying breed

by Sam Campbell

With all the emphasis on the
more well-known traditions in
Lexington, we seem to overlook
the many unique aspects of this
town which have come to be a
way Of life for the townspeople.
The Lexington Bowling Alley is
orie of a dying breed — it is one

of a very small number of alleys
nationwide which still employs
manual pinsetters. The owners,
Mr. & Mrs. Jim Barger, say
they have heard of only one
other such alley, located on
Maryland’s Eastern Shore.

The Bargers have been runn-
ing the alley for 17 years. Mrs.

Barger usually handles the
nightly sessions, while Mr.
Barger spends a considerable
amount of time on the road with
his other job. When asked why
they haven’t replaced their
manual pinsetters with the
more-conventional electronic
machines, Mrs. Barger stated,

 

as Pg

‘“‘why, it would cost us an arm
and a leg! The people from
Brunswick have been here
before, and they didn’t want to
stay, so we’ve kept it this way.
I’m sure that if the people with
money wanted to, they could
build an alley with all the fancy
equipment, but so far they
haven’t. Most towns this size
don’t even have analley.”’

And most of the townspeople
wouldn’t want it changed.
Leagues and, since a week or so
ago, Intramurals keep the alley
busy six nights a week. The
Men’s Duckpin League bowls
Monday nights, the I-M league
rolls on Tuesdays, the Women’s
League bowls on Thursday,s
and the Mixed Couples compete
on Sunday nights. Other nights
are filled with the other
leagues, so the Bargers are kept
plenty busy. The leagues are
sponsored by various
businesses around town, in-
cluding Southern States, FNEB,
Centel, and Hull’s_ Drive-in
Theatre.

It only costs 75* to bowl a line
at the alley, which is perhaps
the cheapest entertainment in
town. Mrs. Barger says, ‘‘they

soon be calling W&L by a dif-
ferent name. Canfield would
probably suggest something in
the line of ‘‘The Five Stooges.”
This sounds harsh, but it seems
appropriate.

Against Gettysburg, a team
that entered Warner Center
with a 2-10 record, the Generals
played like a_ group of
Strangers. As Canfield put it:
Everyone played much too in-
dividually. We didn’t come
ready to play, and it would have
been a shame if we’d won
because we deserved to lose.”’

From the start, the Generals
appeared to lack the killer in-
stinct that has come and gone
throughout the season. W&L
held leads of two and three
points throughout the first half,
but they could pull away no fur-
ther than 38-32, when Get-
tysburg scored the final four
points of the half to close within
two, 38-36.

In the opening moments of the
second half, the Generals seem-
ed to finally take control of the
game. Two Carby Hoy free
throws upped the lead to 52-47,
but once again the Bullets came
back and this time took the
lead, 63-61, with 5:05 remaining.
W&L led again at 65-63 on a Tom
Jeffries lay-up, but the
Generals could not score
another point until 1:58 remain-
ed in the game. Meanwhile,
Gettysburg ran off eight
straight points to build a 71-65
lead. This lead seemed insur-
mountable when the Bullets led
77-70 with only 44 seconds left.
Then, all hell broke loose.

Jeffries sank a short jumper
to make the score 77-72 with 35
seconds left. Then the craziest
play of the season occurred.
Gettysburg threw the ball in-
bounds and Mike Wenke fouled
Gordon Summers. In apparent
glee or sheer stupidity, the
Bullets’ Bob Venerable grabbed
the W&L basket, resulting in a
two shot technical foul. Sum-
mers missed his one and one
chance, while Wenke made both
technical foul free throws. W&L
trailed 77-74 with 0:34 remain-
ing. Because the technical oc-
curred during a dead ball situa-
tion, there was a jump ball at
midcourt. The Generals con-
trolled and took three shots
before Rob Smitherman went to
the line for two chances.
Smitherman missed one and
made one. It was now 77-75 with
25 seconds left.

Gettysburg choked on
another one and one chance,
and W&L controlled the ball
with 0:21 left. The Generals
called time out with ten seconds
left to set up for one last shot. As
Canfield explains it: ‘‘We
wanted to swing around and
take a shot with six seconds left.
We put up a 23-footer, which is
not sound basketball.’’ In a
situation where team play is
essential, the Generals panick-
ed and lost a game they should
have won.

Coach Canfield summed it up
best. ‘‘We played stupid basket-
ball. That’s stupid, stupid,
stupid...”’

Gifts from alumni put
fencing on rise at W&L

by Bill Sherwin

Thanks to a gift from VMI
fencing coach and Washington
and Lee alumnus Tad Hum-
phreys, the W&L fencing team
is looking forward to its second
season of competitive fencing
this winter.

Mr. Humphreys, a member of
the last fencing team
Washington and Lee had in 1942,
spearheaded a gift of $325.00,
together with fellow alumni Dr.
William M. Manger of New
York City, Mr. T. Haller
Jackson, (Jr.) of Shreveport,
Louisiana, and Mr. George T.
Blackburn of Henderson, North
Carolina. Thanks to the
generous support of these men,
the team was able to buy an
electric Leon Paul scoring
machine. The funds were sup-
plemented by part of the
$1200.00 which was granted to
the team by the Executive com-
mittee last year.

The team was founded in the
winter of 1977 by Dr. James
Worth, university psychologist
and present coach of the squad.
At the time, the only weapon us-
ed was the foil, and much of the
equipment used by the team
was bought by the fencers
themselves. Last year, the
team expanded to the sabre and

epee’, the other two recognized.

weapons in the sport. In 1977,
the team could only compete
against itself, since they lacked
the experience or skill
necessary to challenge other
schools.

But the team of 1978 showed
remarkable improvement, and
recorded its first official victory
last year against James
Madison University. The team
lost two matches that year to

.Dr. Worth,

VMI and George Mason Univer-
sity, both of which have very
good, experienced: teams. ‘‘The
team gained valuable ex-
perience that season,” remarks
Dr. Worth. This year we may do
very well.”

Worth has good cause for op-
timism. The team was _ for-
tunate to acquire some very
good talent in this year’s
freshman class. Dave Hepler, a
freshman from Chatham
Township, New Jersey, and
Steve King, from Akron, Ohio,
were both captains of their high
school teams and have con-
tributed heavily to the epee’ and
foil teams, respectively. In ad-
dition to these talented young
stars, the team is cultivating
tnree first year fencers in the
persons of brothers Clyde and
Fletcher Harkrader, and
freshman Colt Puryear. Dr.
Worth is really impressed with
the development of these newer
fencers. “I feel we have an ex-

-ceptional amount of new talent

this year.

The team thus far is 1-2 on the
season, having dropped mat-
ches to UVa., a team which was

ranked second last year behind
William and Mary. The score

was very close, the final score
being 15-12, and according to
“a few touches
either way could easily have

made the difference in whether ©

or not we could have beaten one
of the best teams in the state. Of
course, I was pleased with the
way we fenced against them.”’
The sabre team, led by junior
Bill Hill, actually defeated the
Sabres of UVa., a result which
pleased Worth very much. He
cited Hill as having an excellent
match and praised Dave

Garner and Dave Bryant for
their performance this year.
“Garner is a good fencer, but he
has had real problems with his
knees, which has hurt him a
bit.”

The fencers face what has to
be the most formidable
schedule of the team since its
1977 rebirth. They face the
Navy squad at VMI this Satur-
day, January 27, and on
February 3 they go against
Duke University in the Warner
Center. On the fourth of
February they take on James
Madison and William and Mary
in a triangular meet, and then
return home on the 24th to face
VPI and VMI. The last meet of
the season before the Virginia
Cup will be another home
match against the Citadel on
March 3.

Swimming now 1-4

by Tim Connors

Despite some outstanding in-
dividual performances,
Washington & ‘Lee’s swimming
team dropped a dual meet to
Towson State on Saturday.
W&L’s record stands at 1-4, and
Coach Bill Stearns is now gear-
ing his swimmers toward post-
season competition.

Junior Bob Newcomb led the
Generals against Towson State,
placing first in three events.
Newcomb won the 50-meter
freestyle, the  100-meter
freestyle, and was a member of
the winning 400-meter freestyle
relay team. Newcomb’s time in
the 50m. freestyle allowed him
to join Keith Romich as W&L’s
qualifiers for the nationals. Also
placing first for the Generals
were Junior Drew Pillsbury,
who won the 200m. backstroke
and was a member of the 400
free relay ‘team, co-captain
Chip Hoke, who won the 1000
free, and co-captain Romich,
who won the 200 butterfly.

Stearns said that although

W&l is “swimming well in-
dividuatly, we are not doing as
well as can be hoped in dual
meet competition.’’ Stearns

pointed to the fact that ‘‘schools
on our schedule who have not
been successful recently have
improved greatly this year.”

He said that rather than ‘‘taper-
ing”’ (resting) his swimmers for
dual meets, that he is having
them ‘‘swim through,’’ that is,
they are working as hard as
ever toward the goal of the state
meet for most, and the na-
tionals for Romich, Newcomb,
and others whom he expects to
qualify before the season is
through.

Stearns makes it clear that
“‘we are not conceding the rest
of the regular season’’ but that,

“at this point our main objec-
tive is to make a strong showing
in postseason competition.”
The Generals’ next meet is on
Saturday at William & Mary,
and Stearns expects ‘‘a tough
meet.”

Invitational Sat.

by Greg Branan

Ray Gross was the only.

Washington and Lee winner in
last Saturday’s The Citadel In-
vitational Meet. The Generals
placed sixth out of eight teams
overall.

Gross, who is only a junior,
defeated his first opponent 7-2,
his next by default, and in the
champion match beat his Duke
opponent 3-2. Coach Gary
Franke commented that ‘‘Gross
did a good job,” considering
“the field that was there.”

At the 167-pound weight class,
W&L got a “‘pleasant surprise,”
as Franke put it, from Dave

Stoeffel. Stoeffel finished third .

in his class winning 4-3, 14-11
and by a pin in the consolation
finals over the same opponent
who had beaten him earlier.

Ed Rodgers at 158, Tom Oxen-
dine at 177, and Dan Kniffen at
190, all won one match and lost
two. Franke seemed pleased
with the results of the meet,
saying that ‘‘we’re where we
need to be as a team.”

W&L’s first annual Wrestling
Invitational will be this Satur-
day at the Warner Center all
day. Competing against the
Generals will be Catawba,
EMC, Hampden-Sydney, Lyn-
chburg, Longwood, Pfeiffer and
Davidson.

Award named for Larson,’77

Coach Verne Canfield has an-
nounced a new basketball team
award which will be given for
the first time this March and be
an annual presentation. The
award is entitled “General of
the Year” and is awarded in the
memory of Chris Larson (W&L,
1977), a four year performer for
the basketball Generals who
was fatally injured in an
automobile accident in August.

The award is given for the
qualities which were symbolic
of Chris’ career at W&L. Each
W&L player is awarded a “‘blue
star’’ for making four or more
assists in one game, grabbing at
least seven rebounds in one
game, hitting a minimum of

three of four free throws in a
game, or being credited with
two or more recoveries, or tak-
ing two or more charges in one
game.

The sixth category is deter-
mined by practice performance

and is voted on by the teams’
senior council consisting of the
four seniors on the 1978-79 team.
After fifteen games, junior Tom ...
Jeffries leads in the number of
“blue stars,” with Mike Wenke
and Carby Hoy close behind.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK —&* MILER

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
The people
of Henry Street

There is a need for more student housing in Lex-
ington. A greater availability of housing for college
students in town would, hopefully, foster more com-
petition, which will give student tenants more clout
with landlords and might even have a beneficial ef-
fect on the rental rates that some believe are already
excessive.

But the need for more student housing must be
weighed against the cost in providing such housing.
Not only must economic factors be considered but the
human price also has to be dealt with. The people liv-
ing on Henry Street belong to the lowest economic
segment of our society. More often than not, they are
usually also the segment most ignored by our society
as a whole.

Mr. Stearns’ renovation of the Henry Street area is
undoubtedly good for the city, both economically and
cosmetically. But it behooves all of us not to forget the
human factor in the renovation seheme. To us, this
whole situation somewhat resembles a Monopoly
game—but with real property and real people. Only,
the people who are getting squeezed out of this hous-
ing game are too poor to play and their present hous-
ing situation is no passing diversion. They are the vic-
tims of the housing game and we are all responsible
for seeing that they are not hurt in the process.

Idealism is a college student’s trademark, we sup-
pose. But if newspapers do not report the plight of
these people and work in their behalf, then what are
newspapers for? Who else will stand up and help those
who do not have the resources to help themselves?
Where will the people of Henry Street go if they
already live in the lowest-cost housing available in the
city? Perhaps some people hope they will just leave
quietly without a fuss, like those before them. But
something is terribly wrong with our sense of values if
we really consider our less fortunate fellow humans
as mere pawns in our game of life. There can be no
greater service than helping your fellow man—and
that is what newspapers are all about.

Some things never change

It looks like all of you ‘‘coeduca-
tionists,’’ who have predicted doom
and destruction for the W&L admis-
sions policy for the past few years,
may just have to eat your words
again. A survey prepared by UCLA
for the American Council on Educa-
tion, shows that W&L continues to
ride a wave of popularity among
qualified high school students.

The records of this year’s
freshmen show that 65% were in the
top quarter of their high school
class, as opposed to the national
average of under 50%. In addition,
almost 70% listed W&L as their first
choice of colleges when they were
applying. This is even more gratify-
ing when one notes that the majority
of our freshmen were accepted by
three or more colleges last spring.

When you come down to it, the
ACE survey held very few surprises.
Approximately 40% of the freshmen
listed themselves as political conser-
vatives, more than twice the na-
tional average. Some 42% of their
parents earned more than $50,000
last year, while the nationwide
survey includes only 7% in that
group. The renovation of McCor-
mick isn’t starting a minute too
soon, for the growing appeal of
business is manifest in the class of

1982 — over 30% listed business as
their probable major! About the on-
ly surprising answer was to the
question: ‘‘Are you a reborn Chris-
tian?” Nearly one-fifth of the
freshmen said yes...

Socially, the W&L freshman con-
tinues to excel — for better or worse.
Survey results state that 70% of our
freshmen think that sex is OK if the
two people ‘‘like each other’’ (only
44% said this on the national scale).
Three quarters of the class has
“Stayed up all night’ (whatever that
means), well above overall stan-
dards. And the final accolade —
while 68% of the nation’s freshmen
stated that they had a marked
preference for beer, W&L freshmen
agreed to the tune of 93%...sort of
restores your faith, doesn’t it?

So, admissions officials take
heart. For another year, you have
succeeded in bringing to W&L the
students that she has traditionally
attracted. They might enjoy three to
five pitchers nightly, and as Dr.
Leyburn said recently, there may
not be many ‘“W&L poets and
novelists,” but they are an ad-
mirable group nonetheless. ‘‘Tradi-
tion’? — for all its drawbacks — con-
tinues, much to our relief, to pay off
at W&L.

Letters To The Editor

Student complains about book
theft, resales to the bookstore

Editor:

I am writing this letter out of frustration and
disappointment more than anything else. When I
entered this University, it was with the
understanding that the honor system was a
viable entity and its observance was more the
rule than the exception. When such optimism as
the Honor System is not backed up by a little
common sense and prevention, then problems
are sure to occur.

The problem which concerns and infuriates me
is that of book theft. Myself and many of my
friends have been victims of this somewhat com-
monplace practice and the number of incidents
is growing. My case is particularly maddening
because I have since located my book but there is
literally nothing I can do.

It all started in the fall semester when I, as a
naive freshman, left my Psychology book in the
cafeteria while I ate lunch. The book had my
name in it as well as my notebook. After eating,
when I came to pick it up, it was gone! The act
was obviously intentional, because whoever took
it removed my notebook and left it.

Checking the various ‘‘lost and found”’ stations
on campus produced no results.

This was the situation until the beginning of
this term when I walked into a friend’s room, and
found my book lying on his desk. Of course I was
bewildered; I never thought a friend would steal

receipt.

I then went to the bookstore and they told me
that used books are bought not by them but by a
book company and there was little they could do.
I was also infuriated by the fact that neither this
book company nor the school ask for any iden-
tification from people selling used books.

Suddenly, I painfully realized that, as three
other students on my hall have, anyone can steal
your books, keep them till the end of the term
and then resell them for a profit to the school.
When I looked at my book I also realized that it
was stolen for resale and not for use because it
was in perfectly new condition without another
name, highlighting, or marks of any kind.

When I did a little checking around, I realized
that this was no isolated incident and that there
is no way to catch the culprit. I have also sug-
gested several ways to lessen this practice with
the manager at the bookstore. One of which
should be a list of ‘‘missing’’ books, with any
identifying marks listed also, which should be
posted in the Coop.

I’m not saying that the honor system is not
working because it functions perfectly in many
instances. Even so, I think that when it is being
broken under certain circumstances, then
preventative measures should definitely be
taken. I’m mad as hell becuase now I don’t feel
that it is safe for me to put my books down, and

Librarian
Appointed

Nan Elizabeth Smith, a 1978
librarianship graduate of
Emory University in Atlanta,
has been named acquisitions
librarian in the Wilbur C. Hall
Library of Washington and Lee
University’s School of Law.

Ms. Smith, who was a library
assistant at Emory, is also a
graduate of Smith College,
where she received her B.A. in
music. She is a member of the
American Association of Law
Libraries and the American
Library Association.

Her appointment, effective
earlier this month, was an-
nounced by Sarah K. Wiant,
head librarian in the W&L law
school.

those who rule must concern
themselves with the welfare of
those who are ruled. Because
one was well-born, one natural
ly assumed full responsibility

for the community All
privilege obligates.

No men in modern America
are more privileged than
students at Washington and
Lee. Economic background,

education, health, range of ac-
quaintance, knowledge of the
word, personal gifts, awareness
of moral imperatives all
nese advantages and more put
Washington and Lee men in a
position similar to that of the
aristocrats who lived, by the
code of noblesse oblige. Can we
then say that it is characteristic
of this University’s graduates
and students that they
automatically, and without hav-
ing to reflect on the expenditure
of time and energy and im-
agination, exert themselves for
the benefit of their com-
munities?

To return for a moment to the
great Greeks, let’s ask why

great-souled; greatness of mind
and heart; the habit of feeling
and acting worthily under all
circumstances; high-mindness ;
intrinsic nobility (note here the
implication of noblesse oblige).
The Oxford continues: ‘‘In its
earlier use the word implies
especially high courage and no-
ble steadfastness of purpose, in
its later use, high-minded
generosity..’ The was _ what
Newman had in mind when he
named the essentials a universi-
ty should instill in its students,
and put magnanimity among
them.

My hope and dream for
Washington and Lee is that
from this Tap Day forward,
from this day when we honor
those adjudged excellent
among us, your generations of
Washington and Lee men will
dedicate themselves to
magnanimity, to cultivating the
ideals of arete and noblesse
oblige. You could from this day
forward transform the Univer-
sity. Then in future years we
might all look back on this day
and say, with Henry V to his

character and leadership of Lee
that ODK was founded on this
campus in 1914. Since its
establishment, ODK has spread
to approximately 150 colleges
and universities and has served
as a vehicle for promoting Lee’s
ideals.

Though our purpose today is
to honor campus leaders, I

 

“(.. there always seem to be many more eccentrics
on the faculty and staff here at W&L
than there are among the students half their age.”

 

Athenian youths were so eager
to live to the ideals of arete.
What did they gain? At most, in
a material way, only the crown
of a simple laurel wreath. Much
more important was_ the
awareness that one’s abilities
might bring glory to his polis,
his dear city, that would make it
shine more brilliantly than
ever. Here was something big-
ger than self to live for; and the
more honor one achieved per-
sonally, the more significant his
contribution might be to the
community.

What have you done to make
Washington and Lee a more ad-
mirable university? The first
by-law of this institution
declares that we are not a
denominational institution; but
then the by-law continues: *‘The
obligation to inculcate the
Christian ideal is hereby -af-
firmed.”’ I think I should name
as our greatest shortcoming our
failure to take that obligation
seriously. Whatever else the
Christian ideal comprehends, it
surely includes compassion,
kindness to others, service, lov-
ing one’s neighbor as oneself.
Not many students seem truly
aware of the conditions of life
beyond the campus, of the
poverty and distress and_in-
justices that exist within a mile
of this building and in
Rockbridge County; and I fear
that only a few of our 1700
students are doing anything
positive to alleviate these condi-
tions and this suffering.

There is a_ splendidly
sonorous word, beloved of
Milton and Bacon, that sums up
both the ideal of arete and that
of noblesse oblige. That word is
magnanimity. The great Oxford
Dictionary is rich in its com-
ment on the word. It means

men just before Agincourt, ‘‘We
few, we happy few, we band of
brothers...will stand a tip-toe
when this day is named!”

would like to digress for a few
moments to convey some im-
pressions I have gathered dur-
ing 6'2 years on this campus,
regarding the role which W&L
plays in promoting ODK’s
ideals and the current strength
of these ideals on campus.

As I have mentioned, ex-
emplary character is the chief
prerequisite for membership in
ODK. No tradition of this school
contributes more to developing
the character of students than
does the Honor System which
unlike any other to my
knowledge, is administered and
enforced entirely by students. I
have seen the Honor System
come under substantial
scrutiny and criticism but

because of the system’s
brilliant simplicity and resilien-
cy, it has remained strong. I
believe the University’s policy
of treating its students as
responsible adults is beneficial
to the development of character
and in harmony with ODK’s
ideals. ’
In addition, W&L continues to
stress the importance of the stu-
dent athlete. There are no pro-

fessional athletes at W&L nor:
are participants on athletic.

teams judged. by lower
academic standards than other
students or expected to achieve
athletic success at the expense
of intellectual development.
Nevertheless, W&L has not ig-
nored the importance of
athletics as has been evidenced
during my years in Lexington
by the opening of the new gym
and the construction of the new

moot court teams in recent
years, and the development of
the Law School’s oral advocacy
program in general.

The University has lagged,
perhaps, in promoting the
creative and performing arts.
The commitment to the con-
struction of a new arts center,
however, indicates that a
substantial step is about to be
made in this area and the Alpha
Circle hopes financial con-
straints will not delay its con-
struction:

I would like to conclude with
another personal remark regar-
ding the Alpha Circle’s purpose .
of promoting mutual understan-
ding and respect on campus.
When I arrived in Lexington in
1971, the Law School was located
on the Colonnade and seemed to

fields. Our athletic teams con-
tinue to compile . superior
overall records, the success of
the lacrosse team in particular
since 1971 has been astounding
and is a tribute to the Universi-
ty’s approach to athletics.

In the areas of Journalism,
Speech and the Mass Media I
also have detected progress in

the form of increassed student _

participation and interest on the
part of the University: I certain-
ly do not qualify as more than a
casual observer in this regard
and my list of. improvements
are not all inclusive, but it
seems that WLUR has come a
long way with its increased
broadcasting power and entry
into the realm of cable-T.V. The
Ring-Tum-Phi has improved
and certainly can boast more
student support and respect this
year than it had during some of
my undergraduate days. The

‘resurrection of the Ariel, the

campus ‘literary magazine, is
also note worthy as has been the
success of the Law School’s

 

be an integral part of the
University. Although construc-
tion of Lewis Hall has been a
boon to legal education ‘at
Washington and Lee, the
physical separation of the Law
and Undergraduate schools and
incidental changes have
resulted in occassional
misunderstanding and lack of
cooperation between the
students and faculties of the two
schools.

Since one of the traditional
strengths of the University has
been the closeness of the Law
School and the College, I would
like to encourage, on behalf of
ODK, understanding, flexibility
and cooperation between. these
branches of the University. A
demonstration of mutual
respect and unity at W&L would
be efforts to restore on a perma-
nent basis a single University
graduation ceremony. ODK
pledges itself to the realization
cf this goal and solicits the sup-
port of those in attendance to-
day.

Kilbourne speaks
on advertising dangers

(continued from page 1)

Via Advertising,’’ examined the
specific ways in which adver-
tisements reinforce stereotypes
and affect women’s self-
images.

“Advertising is one of the
primary socializing forces in
our society,” she said. ‘‘Adver-
tisements tell us who we are
and who we should be.”’

Her presentation was an ex-
amination of current advertis-
ing techniques that play upon
our subconscious.

“Advertising is exploitive.
Women are either portrayed as
sex objects or maticulously pet-
ty housewives. In both cases,
women are depicted as an in-
ferior class of human being,”
she said, ‘‘and advertising is the
powerful force that keeps us
trapped in these images and
roles.”

Ms. Kilbourne, who has a
B.A. degree from Wellesley Col-
lege and a M. Ed. from Boston
University. has researched for
10 years the effects of the

experienced, all at the same
time,’”’ Ms. Kilbourne said.
‘The face you want is never the
face you have.”’

Advertisers “turn a woman
completely into an object,”’ she
said, ‘‘and once you _ turn
something into an object, you
start abusing that object.”

Ms. Kilbourne said that the
image that women should be in-
nocent with that “‘little girl
look”’ has harmful effects.

“Innocence is sexier than you
think and is a powerful sexual
message,’’ she said. Ms.
Kilbourne said that 25 percent
of all rape victims are under the
age of 12, and she blamed
advertisers who present ‘‘little
girls as sex objects.”

‘‘Most women work, but
advertisers either ignore this or
come up with a new stereotype:
a woman who does everything,
super woman. She works, does
the shopping, takes care of the
children, does the housework,
and even has time to cheer up
sourpuss,’’ she said.

(Present Cold Check policy is
that all checks bounced during
the same time period are
counted as only one offense.
Students can be fined up to $5
for their first offense, $10 for
their second offense, and $25 for
their third offense. After a stu-
dent has appeared before the
committee three times, his next
offense is automatically refer-
red to the Student Control Com-
mittee. )

“This is the type of case that
we only have once or twice a
year,”’ Schoenfeld said. He
wanted his committee to have
the discression to refer a case to
Student Control at any time, no
matter what offense.

The EC unanimously approv-
ed Schoenfeld’s request.

(All fines imposed by the Cold
Check Committee can be ap-
pealled to the EC within 72
hours. )

In other action, the EC heard
a request from W&L lacrosse
coach Jack Emmer for funds to
help pay for a trip to Florida
during the winter break for the
entire lacrosse team.

Emmer said that the training
trip, as now planned, would cost
close to $6,000. He expects to
raise $1,000 through the sale of
visors to lacrosse fans. Parents
of the players are also being
solicited for funds and Emmer
hopes they will contribute
$3-4,000. Emmer hoped the EC
would make up the difference.

After many questions and
much debate, the EC deferred
their decision and told the
lacrosse coach to come back in
a few weeks after he had a bet-
ter indication of how much
money would be raised by other
means.

Various smaller committees
also reported to the EC.

David Hamra and Douglas
Burr of the Admissions Com-
mittee told the EC that they had
had very little input this year,
primarily because of the way
the new Admissions Director,
William Hartog had reorganiz-
ed the whole admissions depart-
ment.

‘In view of the last semester,
is there any reason why your

tative, asked them.

Rob Calvert, senior EC rep.,
registered complaints with Syd
Farrar of the University
Athletic Committee about the
lack of room in the gym for

Farrar told him that varsity
sports get first priority in use of
the gym. Physical Education
classes get second priority, in-
termural sports are next, and
then students may use the gym.

Farrar told the EC.

Grade Review In Trouble

Faculty EC “Waters Down” Student Grade Review Plan

by Randy Smith

Members of Washington and
Lee’s student Executive Com-
mittee are upset over what the
faculty has done to their pro-
posal for a process of grade
review.

“Their (the faculty’s) point is
that they’re being wishy-washy
with us,” said Beau Dudley, EC
president, about the grade
review policy adopted by the
faculty.

Grade review was the topic of
prolonged debate at Monday’s
EC meeting. Discussion
centered on the differences bet-
ween the student EC’s proposed
grade review and the grade
review policy approved by the
faculty in January.

In late November, the student
EC adopted a statement which
would have given students “‘the
right to review and discuss all
graded material and any factor
entering into the final grade.”
Students with a _ grievance
would then be able to get a
review of the grade with the
head of the department.

The hope was to give students

an outlet through which a stu-

dent could appeal a final grade

if he disagreed with the pro-

fessor’s evaluation of his work.
The student EC’s grade

' review proposal was sent to the

Sophomore

Election
Monday

Four candidates will vie Mon-
day for vice-president of the
sophomore class.

Chris Gammon, Rob Willis,
Kevin Dwyer, and Bruce Moore
all submitted petitions to be
placed on next week’s ballot at
Monday’s Executive Commit-
tee meeting.

All four candidates received a
copy of the election rules and
regulations and each was given
a $5 spending limit for his cam-
paign.

The provision for a financial
statement was waved for Mon-
day’s election.

faculty EC for discussion and
possible approval. —

But the grade review state-
ment changed while in the
faculty EC’s hands.

The student EC’s emphasis on
student rights was dropped and
the emphasis became on sug-
gested guidelines for pro-
fessors.

Dean Edward C. Atwood,
chairman of the faculty EC, ex-
plained that the shift in em-
phasis was necessary because
the statement is to appear in the
faculty handbook, which is
oriented toward the faculty, not
students.

Both the shift in emphasis and
the wording of the statement,
which does not bind professors
to the grade reviguidelines,
were sore points with the stu-
dent EC.

“I was disappointed that the
wording was watered down to

‘it is expected that,” Bill

Tucker, EC vice-president and
one of two student represen-
tatives to the faculty EC, said of
the wording approved by the
faculty.

“Well, I think this is a non-
clever way to aviod the issue at
hand,”’ said Dudley.

“This (the faculty EC’s
policy) is just a codification of

City Council Will Not
Change Noise Ordinance ,,

by John Billmyre

A representative of Lex-
ington’s City Council told a
meeting of the Interfraternity
Council Tuesday night that the
city’s noise ordinance will not
be changed, despite a good
behavior record on the part of
fraternities.

After waiting 35 minutes for
the arrival of City Council
member Dr. Thomas C. Im-
eson, fraternity members were
informed by him that the ‘‘City
Council will not change the

 

 

The Executive Committee of the Student
Body is concerned over the existing situation
regarding grading, specifically :

A) Students have no appelate process in
which to protest their grades;

B) A student’s final evaluation might be bas-
ed upon work which he has never seen (e.g.
final exams) ;

C) Students are sometimes unaware of what
weight will be given each assignment or test
in the computation of the final grade.

With these thoughts in mind, the Executive
Committee recommends that the Faculty
adopt the following guidelines:

I) Students have the right to question any pro-
fessor concerning a grade he has received.
Any student feeling that he has been unjustly
treated has the right to bring the matter to the
attention of the Department Head. The
Department Head shall then review the grade
in question with the professor involved.

II) Students have the right to view and
discuss all graded material and any factor
entering into the final grade within a
reasonable time after receipt of that grade.
Professors shall keep final examinations for a
period of one month into the semester follow-
ing examination.

III) At the beginning of the term, the pro-
fessor should provide a course syllabus which
includes, among other things, a general
schedule of expected assignments and an ap-
proximate percentage analysis of the final
grade.

 

 

 

Faculty EC Guidelines

(approved Dec. 8;
present policy)

In response to a petition from the Executive
Committee of the Student Body, the Ex-
ecutive Committee of the Faculty recom-
mends that the following statement (which
describes present practice) be inserted in the
Faculty Handbook and a copy be sent to the
Executive Committee of the Student Body.

“It is the expectation that each professor
will:

1. Provide at the beginning of the course a ten-
tative schedule of assignments and a descrip-
tion of how the final grade will be determined.

2. Be willing to discuss and review all aspects
of a student’s grade within a reasonable time
after receipt of the grade.

noise ordinance.”

Imeson compared Lex-
ington’s noise ordinance to
noise laws in other towns such
as Charlottesville, Blacksburg,
and Harrisonburg saying,
“compared to others it is fair.”
He also said that the noise or-
dinance in Charlottesville is
more stringent. :

The ensuing conversation bet-
ween Imeson and fraternity
representatives was often
heated. .

Imeson was quick to point out
that ‘fraternity members will

be treated like any other -

member or citizen of the com-
munity,’’ and that in relation to
the noise ordinance the Council
“‘would not make any weekday
special.”

But most fraternity represen-
tatives questioned enforcement
of the present regulation and
not the possibility of a new or-
dinance. Several represen-

tatives complained that the
noise ordinance is being enforc-
ed selectively.

Imeson disputed this accusa-
tion saying that “I see no signs
of capricious enforcement.”

Imeson’s statement in sup-
port of the Lexington Police
force is a continuation from a
stance taken earlier this year
when he told the IFC in October,
“The police department’s ac-
tion is directly proportional to
the number of complaints they

receive.”

Yet many _ representatives
still disagree, and Jeff Robin-
son became so disgusted with
Imeson that he stood up and left
during the meeting saying, ‘‘Oh
hell, man, we didn’t come here
to listen to this.”’

Contacted after the meeting,
Robinson, who is Kappa Alpha’s
representative, said he
“couldn,t believe Imeson.”’

Wednesday, January 24,
marked the revival of the once
popular Ariel Readings. Ben
Keesee, Phil Welch and Mark
Richard journeyed to Sweet
Briar to participate in a reading
sponsored by the staff of
Brambler, the Sweet Briar
literary magazine. Both poetry
and prose were read and
discussed during the two-hour
session held in the Sweet Briar
Writers’ Workshop.

Ariel editor Ben Keesee call-
ed the experience ‘‘well worth
the time.” Further, each of the
participants, felt that there
were many solid constructive
criticisms made. Keesee hopes
to continue the series of
readings with girls from
Hollins, Mary Baldwin and
Randolph-Macon Women’s Col-
lege. .

A second significant step
taken by Keesee is the organiza-
tion of an Ariel business staff.
Business manager Bob
Bergman and other staff
members are attempting to

develop enough advertising
revenue to “‘over go”’ the expan-
sion allowed by this year’s
generous E.C. funding. Under
the proposed system, local
businesses would be patrons of
Ariel and would be listed at the
back of the magazine.

With regard to the production
end of Ariel, Keesee has two
goals. The first is a second issue
before spring vacation. The se-
cond is the formation of a real
Ariel staff to bring continuity to
Ariel’s growth. Keesee says
that ten people attended the last
Ariel meeting and that there
are others who are interested.
Says Keesee, ‘‘Now is the time
to get into the magazine.”’

He says that contributions for
the second issue “‘look good,”’
but that he is looking for draw-
ings and critical pieces.

Keesee commented, ‘I’m
very optimistic about the future
of Ariel. Through the support of
the E.C., staff members and
contributors, great steps are be-
ing made toward a complete
resurrection of Ariel.’

Rusher served for 17 months as
associate counsel to the Senate
Internal Security Subcom-
mittee from 1956 to 1957.

He is the author of many
books, including his most recent

Party.” He is also a sydicated

Independents’ Union Has
Membership Problems

by Dave Murray

The Washington and Lee
University Independents’ Union
was forced to postpone the elec-
tion of officers Monday night
when a majority of the
membership failed to show up.

Independents’ Union leader
John Schmidt blamed the

sparse turnout on a “media.

blockage.” He plans a mass
media blitz, before trying to
hold elections again a week
from today.

Monday night’s failure was
another bitter pill for Schmidt.
He organized the Union at the
beginning of the year and has
been the driving force behind it
ever since. He has seen en-
thusiasm diminish despite his
efforts.

According to Schmidt W&L
caters to the fraternities. He
pointed to the recent purchase
of housing for the infant Chi Psi
fraternity. ‘‘And I had to grovel
in front of the EC for $100 for 500
people.’’

Although a framework for an
Independent Union is-supposed
to exist at W&L, there are no
funds and there is no meeting
place for the organization.
Schmidt pried the $100 away
from the EC on the condition
that it be used for organiza-
tional purposes. He put up

posters and a large number of
independents attended the first
meeting.

A Christmas party was held
in the Cockpit and it convincted
Schmidt that he would succeed.
Of the 500 independents on cam-
pus, nearly 60 paid dues and at-
tended the party, along with a
large number of girls and some
fraternity members. Perhaps
that’s why he finds it so hard to
quit now.

“‘T hate to see all the work I’ve
done go down the tubes,’’ he
said.

A week from Thursday,
Schmidt will try one more time.
Before the 7:30 p.m. meeting in
duPont Auditorium, however,
he plans to tell as many
students as he can about the
meeting.

Spots on radio and television
are just the beginning. He says
he will also put up 100 posters on
campus. At last Monday’s
meeting Schmidt complained
that his posters had been pulled
down. “I put up 30 posters on
Thursday (before the meeting)
with four pieces of tape on each
one. Now (Monday) there’s
about four left. You think the
wind blew them down?”’

Of next week’s 100 posters,
Schmidt says, “I dare anyone to
rip down one of the posters.’’

Ring-tum Phi Housing Series

KA’s Lease “Leaves Much To Be Desired”

 

by Mike Perry

Just as students have encountered
difficulties in the search for housing,
so fraternities have also had their
problems.

As Kappa Alpha Order president
Henry Hamilton states, ‘We are
presently leasing a house from
another fraternity, and the lease ar-
rangements leave much to be
desired.”’

The KAs rent their East Nelson
Street residence from the Psi Up-
silon Alumni Association of Virginia.

Psi Upsilon was a fraternity here
at W&L until it folded in the spring of
1975. Their fraternity house was
abandoned until the KAs began ren-
ting it in the fall of 1975, following the
reactivation of the Washington and
Lee chapter.

Hamilton explains that ““when KA
reactivated, the house was viewed
as a temporary home until a better
facility could be located and financ-
ed.”’

When the KAs contracted the ser-
vices of Henry L. Ravenhorst, a
local architect and professor of
engineering to investigate the
possibilities of purchasing and ex-
panding their present home or
building another facility, it was con-
cluded that their best option was to
purchase the house from the Psi Up-
silon Alumni Association and begin
renovating it.

The KAs then drafted a plan to
purchase and renovate the house
based up the counsel of William J.
Foresman, a local lawyer, and
Ravenhorst.

After gaining approval from the
University trustees for a loan from
the University last spring, the KA
submitted a $42,5000 bid to purchase
the house. The Psi Upsilon Alumni
Association flatly rejected the offer
claiming that they would only con-
sider the higher price of $70,000.

Although the house is valued on
the Lexington City records at
“$86,800, KA _ president Henry
Hamilton believes that the market
price of the house is actually very
close to their bid.

Make Watson, KA vice-president,
believes that the price favored by
the Psi Upsilon Alumni Association
reflects funds needed by the
Association to cover debts incurred
by the fraternity when it folded in
1975.

As Hamilton states, ‘‘Mr. Robie
(president of the Psi Upsilon Alumni
Association) told me that the $70,000
price represented the remainder of
their mortgage to the University and
outstanding debts.”’

Hamilton does not foresee any pro-

spect of obtaining a more attractive —

lease because he believes the

one-year leases, as they did last spr-
ing for the current academic year.

Watson says that most of the KAs’
objections to the existing lease stem
from the ‘problem of absentee
landlord” and that the landlord has
no knowledge of the real condition of
the house.

Under the existing lease, the KA
chapter is fully liable for all minor
repairs, such as paint, building and
property maintenance. The KAs
have already paid for a host of
repairs, many of which were made
‘to comply with I.F.C. directives.

The lease further states that the
KAs must pay one half of all major
repairs.

Last fall, the house’s water heater

broke down and had to be replaced
at a cost of $500 to the KA chapter.

When the landlord was delinquent
in his payment of his half of the
repair bill ($500), the KAs paid the
full cost of the repair work to the
local plumber. The KAs_ then
deducted this expense from rent due
the landlord and received an angry
response from Psi Upsilon Alumni
Association president Robie.

This year’s lease, which included
a $600 rent increase, now requires
that the KA chapter bear the entire
cost of any major repairs.

KA president Hamilton explains
that ‘‘already this year, we had to
pay for the priority one items re-
quired by the fraternity inspection

committee report of the Student Af-
fairs Committee.”” Hamilton adds,
“We cannot afford to pay for any
more extra expenses for capital im-
provements to the house that would
ordinarily be paid by the owner.”’

The KAs also object that the only
compensation provided for in the
lease for repairs and improvements
to the house must come in the form
of a reduction in the eventual pur-
chase price of the house. Included in
this list are only those repairs deem-
ed necessary by the landlord.

Watson maintains that the
landlord has not made any repairs
on the house (with the exception of
the hot water heater) in the last two
and one-half years.

Good eats at:

Lee’s

By Barron & Potter
Ace News Team

As inevitable as the change of
seasons is a change of manage-
ment of the restaurant on the
corner of Lee and Nelson
streets. Once the Corner Grill,
more recently and more
dismally the Good Trencher-
man, this landmark has more
recently become Lee's Corner.

Thankfully gone is the mock-
deli decor of the Good Trencher-
man. In its place one finds a
thoroughly unpretentious _at-
mosphere. This atmosphere is
created by an interesting com-
bination of modern art and
homey antiques. Particularly
intriguing is the hockey stick
placed over a back exit.

In any case, our business is
food. The menu calls the
restaurant a haven ‘‘for hearty
appetites at reasonable prices.’
Eh viola. such is the case. We
¥orged ourselves for under four
dollars each. One of us really
pigged out and had the
equivalent of two lunches for
under $4. Our repast included a
quarter-pound reast beef sand-
wich, a quarter-pound ham-
burger, and a “super dog.”

We found the roast beef sand-

wich to be generously endowed
with beef. As well, the roast
beef was of a quality rarely to
be found in a simple sandwich.
Pleasantly absent were the
large pockets of gristle com-
monly associated with a roast
beef sandwich. The super dog
was covered with everything
imaginable, including chili,
slaw, mustard, and cheese,
making it juicy and tasty in-
deed.

But what truly distinguishes
Lee’s Corner are the small
touches. Each sandwich comes
fully equipped with a hearty
pile of fresh chips and the best
dill spear this side of a New
York deli.

More reasons to see:

The status of rock and roll has
recently been a questionable
point on this campus for many
reasons: popularity of disco
and/or beach music, preoc-
cupation with other campus ac-
tivities, lack of a good FM radio
station specializing in rock, and

Corner

Another point of interest on
the menu is the soup de jour —
cur day, a rich and pleasing
chicken noodle.

Although we dined on stan-
dard luncheon fare, a dinner
menu is also available. Steak,
seafood, roast beef, and pork
chops, with choice of vegetables
are offered at generally
moderate prices (especially at-
tractive is roast beef au ju
priced at $3.50). :

Owners Roger Dyer and Jim- .

my Greene, with their good food
in a comfortable atmosphere,
make one hope that they have
better luck at this location than
their ill-fated predecessors.

On the southern leg of their
winter tour of the U.S., Boston
played to a packed house in the
Roanoke Civic Center Wednes-
day, Jan. 24. Sammy Hagar’s
opening set was cut short by
several power failures, even-
tually delaying Boston’s ar-
rival. Once on stage, the
headline band kicked off the
show with ‘Rock n Roll Band,”’
followed by a virtually con-
tinuous concernt of their most
well-known material.

Boston’s performance, led by

guitarist Tom Scholz, was
technically perfect, thoroughly
rehearsed, and true to recorded
versions. Unfortunately, this
automaton approach, appealing
to the adolescent record buyer,
lacks the sponteneity and drive
which might appeal to the more
seasoned concert-goer. Bostom
simply lacks the showmanship
and stage presence so impor-

the monotony was broken by a

Fraternity Frolics

by Parker Potter
and Dick Barron

After viewing episode no. 2 of
“Delta House,’’ one can only
conclude that the series is
doomed to serving as a poorly
constructed imitation of
‘“‘Animal House.’’ The idea of a
TV spinoff from a _ popular
movie is not new, and it has
been done with some degree of
success in the past (M*A*S*H
being the most successful ex-
ample).

When ‘‘Animal House’ was
taken off the big screen and
turned into ‘Delta House,’’ one
hoped the opportunism of the
big network might create an
entertaining College Comedy.
Including four characters from
the movie (Hoover, D-Day,
Flounder, and Dean Wormer),
“Delta House’ seemed well
conceived.

But the similarity with
‘Animal House’’ ends when the
dim-witted television writers
replace the talented Lampoon
writers. Gone is the sharp edg-
ed directing and _ scripting
which kept ‘Animal House’
viewers coming back for more,

Instead, all we see is a (dare I
say it?) sophomoric atte t at
Kollege Kapers. All is lost is
this sterilized and homogenized
situation comedy. It’s sad to see
the talents of the actors wasted
on the pale skeleton of ‘Delta
House’.

Let’s hope the viewers of

America are smart enough to
remember the joys of ‘“‘Animal
House” — while placing the
bumbling ‘Delta House’’ on
double-secret probation.

pectations to fulfill, NBC’s

The only true surprise came
when Scholtz tripped on the

rock and roll band put on a
show, then this is the band to

Wednesday, and there will be
two shows, one at 7:30 and one
at 10 p.m. Tickets are $3 in ad-
vacne for students, $4 at the
door, which is comparable to
what they are charging in D.C.,
only you do not have to drive
there to see them. They will
receive 100% of the gate
receipts for both shows, and this
is an excellent chance for rock
aficionados to support their
music.

similarly like it was for the

be no tables in the back to allow
those who want to boogie the op-
portunity to do so. The Cockpit
will be closed Wednesday from
5:30 until 6:30 for the set-up,
and all those with tickets will be
admitted at 6:30. Those with
tickets to both shows will not
have to leave after the first
show, and those with tickets to
the second show only should
congregate in the lobby above

the Cockpit near the dining hall,
and not in the Cockpit lobby
near Carole Chappell’s office.
After the first show all those

the second show (or in plain

Brothers and Sisters

(continued from page 8)
for somewhat better video fare
than ‘‘Delta House.”

Unlike ‘‘Delta House,’’
‘Brothers and Sisters’ is set in
the present. This serves as both
an advantage and a constraint.
The pressure of vraisemblence
closes off many slapstick op-
tions exploited by ‘Delta
House.”’

By the same token, ‘“‘Brothers
and Sisters” benefits from its
placement in the present. It has
a softer feel to it than does.
“Delta House.’’ As well as a
softer, less frenzied at-
mosphere, ‘‘Brothers and

~ Sisters’ benefits from a closer

focus.

The show deals with the Pi Nu
fraternity and its sister sorori-
ty, the Gamma Delta Iota
House. The Pi Nu House is no
homogenized ‘‘Delta House.”’ Pi
Nu has a pseudo Bluto (Zipper),
a super-straight (Harlan), a
black (Ronald) and an Aill-
American  boy/quasi-Otter
All the fodder for
comic conflict exists within the
Pi Nu house.

The result of this is a more

eis

human situation comedy. A
similar virtue of “‘Brothers and

“Sisters” is the endings of the
episodes. Both episodes to date
have ended on a very whimsical
note, as opposed to the Cadillac
left hanging from a block and
tackle at the conclusion of the
first ‘Delta House.”’

High art it isn’t, but
“Brothers and Sisters” is a
pleasant diversion on a dateless
Friday night.

Student EC Hot Over Faculty Grade Review Policy

Student EC Modifications of Faculty EC
Guidelines (has yet to be approved)

 

It shall be the responsibility of each professor to:
(Substituted for ‘‘It is the expectation that each professor will:”’)

1. Provide at the beginning of the course a tentative schedule of
assignments and a description of how the final grade will be deter-
mined.

2. Be willing to discuss and review all aspects of a student’s grade
within a reasonable time after receipt of the grade.

3. Retain throughout the next term all graded material not returned
to the student.

Any student believing that his work has been unfairly evaluated
has the right to bring the matter to the attention of the Head of the
Department concerned. The Head of the Department shall
(substituted for ‘‘shall’’) then discuss the grade with the professor
involved; however, the final determination of the student’s grade
remains the responsibility of the professor teaching the course.

Law Student R esigns

as far as the effort I must exert
to do a self-satisfying job, are
far greater than I ever imagin-

ed,”’ she said at Monday’s EC

meeting.

_ “I feel I must sacrifice the
pleasure of time spent on EC
matters in an effort to raise my
overall average and rank
among my classmates.

“The Executive Committee of
W&L has magnified my faith in
student government. More than
ever I believe student govern-
ment has a viable and

necessary function on any
university—especially here,”
she said.

Miss Mims has served on the
EC since her election Oct. 16.

Her resignation will not become
effective until a replacement is

elected from among the first
year law class on Feb. 12. (Peti-
tions from candidates for the
position are due to the EC Feb.
5)

“I for one am sorry Jenelle is
leaving us, but I understand the
reason for her decision,”’ said
EC president Beau Dudley, a
third year law student.

 

I must regretfully resign my
position on the Executive Com-
mittee.

Before my work on the EC
began, I knew how much time
and what type of work I would
be doing. I also thought I knew
what the demands of law school
would be.

Being on the EC has taken
neither less nor more time than
I expected. The work has been
enlightening and worthwhile of
any time it has cost me.

The demands of law school, so
far as the effort I must exert to
do a self-satisfying job, are far
greater than I ever imagined.

After talking with several
lawyers over Christmas, I
realized how much I wanted to
pursue a law career. These con-
versations also reiterated how
important grades would be in
acquiring a position with the
firms I am interested in.

On returning to W&L, I learn-
ed that my grades for the first
semester were far below those I
feel are adequate to compete
with others wanting those same
positions.

 

Text of Mims’

Resignation

More importantly, I was
disappointed personally in my
performance on exams.

While I am very appreciative
of the opportunity the first year
students have given me, I must
relinquish this position.

Grades are so much more im-
portant than I ever realized.
The grades I acquire in the next
five semesters will determine
how much of a ‘‘good start’ my
career will have.

I feel I must sacrifice the
pleasure of time spent on EC
matters in an effort to raise my
overall average and rank
among my classmates.

The Executive Committee of
W&L has magnified my faith in’
student government. More than
ever, I believe student govern-
ment has a viable and

Though my time on the EC
has been short, I can say with
confidence that the students of
Washington and Lee are
represented by conscientious
and sincere gentlemen.

representative to the faculty
EC.

Tucker’s attempts to push
through the word changes at
Tuesday’s faculty EC meeting
were unsuccessful.

“The faculty EC does not act
on issues that are brought up
verbally (in a meeting),’’ Dean
Atwood said of the faculty EC’s
decision not to discuss the stu-
dent EC’s two word changes.
“We need a written request, a
petition.”

Atwood said the changes will
be discussed next Tuesday at
the faculty EC meeting if a peti-
tion for the word change is sub-
mitted, which means that grade
review will not come before the
faculty again until March even
though the faculty meets as a

group this Monday. (The facul-

ty meets only once a month. )

A new topic cannot be brought
up in a faculty meeting, Atwood
explained; it has to be brought
up through the faculty EC first.

Generals romp79-65

by Bill Whalen

All the earmarkings for a
W&L loss were there. The
Generals trailed by ten points
two minutes into the second half
and looked to be totally routed.
It seemed that another 6:30
a.m. practice was a strong
possibility. But the Generals,
with some uncommon help from
the bench and the stands, put it
all together to roll to a 79-65 vic-
tory over Clinch Valley Tues-
day night at Warner Center.

Throughout the first half of
this contest, W&L was over-
whelmed by torrid Cavalier
shooting (67% in the first
period). The leader of this
streak was Steve Moore, whose
12 points paced Clinch Valley to
a 41-35 lead. Carby Hoy scored
11 of his 17 points while Tom
Jeffries added 9 of his game-
high 24 points to keep the score
close.

While Clinch Valley controll-
ed the first half, W&L
dominated the second period.
The Generals, who had shot on-
ly 40% in the opening period, hit
on 68% of their shots in the se-
cond half while outscoring
Clinch Valley 44-24. They key
moment in the game came
when the Generals trailed 45-35
with 18:04 to play. Using five
points from Jeffries, W&L ran
off a 9-2 streak to cut the lead to
47-44. Then, Coach Verne Can-
field put Jim Berlin in, and Dr.
Ewe responded with six points
as W&L went ahead 54-53. From
this point, the Generals
gradually pulled away from
Clinch Valley, as they made
good on their final six one and
one chance to win by 14; 79-65.

Despite the sloppy first half
performance, Canfield was
pleased with the overall play.
“It was a super comeback—it
took a lot of guts,” said the
Coach. ‘‘We made some key
recoveries, but they hurt
themselves by going into the
four corners.’’ The coach was
also pleased with the per-
formance of R.J. Scaggs. R.J.
made four recoveries and had
three charges—he played a nice
game.”

The Generals next game is
tonight against Lynchburg.
This is a key ODAC game and
should go a long way in deter-
mining positions in the ODAC

Tournament. ‘‘We’ll do very
well,’’ said a confident Canfield.
“It’s always a treat or a treat-
ment playing there, but we’re
prepared.”

The Unknown Fans:
Finally- Real Fans

by Bill Whalen

A funny thing happened at
Warner Center this week. It was
noisy. Usually any type of
cheering at a W&L basketball
game ends with the playing of
The Star Spangled Banner —
which is exactly when the
Unknown Fans entered the
arena on Tuesday night.

As they walked on the floor,
everyone wondered who these
promulgators of harrassment
were. To begin with, they are

basketball fans are not. The
Unknown Fans cheer with the
same intensity whether their
team is ten points ahead or ten
points behind. They openly
harass the officials and the
visiting team. In other words,
they make the game exciting,
which is a big switch from the
mausoleum-like atmosphere of
recent games.

There were approximately 20
such rowdies at the Clinch
Valley game. All were attired in
paper bags that varied from the

basic tan model to such lux-
urious items like the ‘Zebra
Bag” or “The Game Is In The
Bag”. Assembled in their
private section of the stands,
the Unknows Fans’ antics rang-
ed anywhere from placing
group whammies on the Clinch
Valley bench to harassing
Clinch Valley free-throw
shooters with more hexes or
turkey globbles.

But why did this group appear
at ‘Tuesday night’s game? As
one Unknown Fan explained:
“Alabama needed help in the
Sugar Bow]; the Steelers need-
ed help in the Super Bowl, and
W&L needs help at home. We
got a call from a student here
who said that W&L had played
an exciting game against Get-
tysburg, and the fans just sat on
their hands during the game.
Now we will stay here through
the rest of this season and pro-
bably through lacrosse, until we
have done our job.”

One person who could not be
happier is Coach Verne Can-
field. As he stated after the 14
point victory: “I cannot com-
mend them enough. This is the
best support we have had in 15
years. I thought they were
fighting a losing battle with the
rest of the crowd, but they were
incredible. They were certainly
a factor in our win.”

Whatever your personal opi-
nion of these fans may be — one
thing can be honestly said. They
may be rude, loud and obnox-
ious, but they add a lot of excite-
ment to a sport that has been
badly ignored at W&L.

It’s snowing-but it’s LAX time

by Steve Jones

For most of us the month of
February is nothing more than
Fancy Dress, Winter Break,
and a Satisfying feeling that one
month of Winter Term is finish-
ed. For lacrosse Coach Jack
Emmer and the entire
Washington and Lee lacrosse
team, however, February
signals the beginning of intense
preparation for the quickly ap-'
proaching lacrosse season.
Many see this as an important
year for the W&L lacrosse pro-
gram. Although the Generals
have reached the post-season
NCAA tournament for seven
consecutive years, last year’s
ninth place finish in the national
rankings was the team’s worst
showing under head coach Em-
mer. The Ring-tum Phi had the

opportunity to visit with Coach
Emmer this week and discuss
his assessment of this year’s
team.

One advantage of this year’s
team, according to Emmer, is
the number of returning let-
termen. Tri-captains Jeff Fritz,
John Black and Sandy
McDonald along with seventeen
other returnees give the 1979
squad the strongest nucleus of
experienced players which Em-
mer has enjoyed in recent
years. The experience of these
players will go a long way in
determining the success of the
Generals this year. Emmer
cites the many strengths of the
team which are a direct result
of the returning lettermen.
First, the attack positions will
be filled by returning All-
Americans Fritz and Black,
who along with junior Jay
Foster, combined for 14 goals
and 49 assists last year. Having
played together for an entire
season, the trio will be expected
to provide a great deal of the of-
fense for the Generals. Emmer,
however, is quick to say that he
will not be orienting the offense
around these three because of
the return of virtually all of last
year’s midfielders. Midfield has
traditionally been a weak spot

for the Generals but not so this
year, according to the coach.
Along with seniors Sandy
McDonald and Dirk Preper,
Emmer will have juniors
Roman Kupecky, Jerry Broc-
coli, Joe Olive, John Hooper and
sophomores George Santos,
Geoff Brent and John Kemp, all
of whom have at least a year of
* experience under their belts.

One area which Emmer feels
is the key to the success of this
year’s team is at the goalie posi-
tion. The coach says lack of
talent at other positions can be
covered but a good goalie is a
necessity. He sees the Generals
as being fortunate in having an
excellent tender in junior Bob
Clements. Having played
behind graduated All-American
Charlie Brown for two years,
Clements appears to be ready to
step in and do a job for the
team. Emmer cites not only the
ability and confidence of the
junior as being important but
also his leadership. Althought
he’s not as flashy as Brown was,
Clements is a solid, fundamen-
tal goalie. If he plays the kind of
lacrosse he’s capable of, there
may be many frustrated at-
tackmen come the end of May.
Behind Clements, however, the
question marks are raised.

Junior Rob Willis will be return-
ing but has yet to be tested. Em-
mer feels this inexperience may
be a hindrance, but sees Willis
as a hard worker who will get
the job done.

The defensive position ex-
poses one of the weaknesses of
the Generals — lack of quality
depth. Returning are junior
Steven Johnson and sophomore
sensation, Jim Herbert, but the
experience ends there. Emmer
sees defense as critical due to
the new ‘“‘no face-off”’ rule being
introduced this season. The rule
simply allows face-offs at the
beginning of each period rather
than, after every goal. After a
goal‘is scored, the team that
was scored upon will receive
the ball at midfield. This will re-
quire the defending team to
have their six best defensemen
on the field which, according to
Emmer, may pose a problem.
The new rule change should

Grapplers now 2-2

by Chris Sisto

The past week has been very
profitable for the Generals
wrestling team as they defeated
Lynchburg 29-17 in dual meet
play and captured the cham-
pionship of the First Annual
Washington and Lee College In-
vitational.

Thursday’s match against
Lynchburg was supposed to be
the only real competition to the
Generals for the ODAC cham-
pionship. However, the
coaching ability of Coach
Franke proved to be too much
of a match. When he saw Lyn-
chburg’s line-up, Coach Franke
switched several players of his
own to higher weights. ‘‘I
wanted to put Ed Rodgers at 167
to counter a talented player that
Lynchburg had at that weight
and to put a freshman at 158.”
Dan Kniffer, at his usual 190
weight, clinched the General
victory with a pin at 2:42.

The surprise of the week,
1owever, came when the
xenerals clinched the cham-
dionship of one of their tour-
iaments for the first time ever.

“I was really surprised to win
his,”’ Franke said. ‘‘I didn’t ex-

pect this at all.’’ Franke had all
seven of the players he placed
in the tournament receive
points. Two were champions.
Mike McFadden, a freshman
was at 150 and Ed Rodgers was
at 158. Three Generals finished
second, Ray Gross at 142, Dave
Stoeffel at 167 and Tom Oxen-
dine at 177. Kniffen finished
third at 190. Those placements
gave the Generals 67.25 points
an eight and a half point win
over the seven team field.

Franke was also pleased with
his wrestlers’ play. “I didn’t ex-
pect the kids to do so well.
Everyone really produced and
got tournament points.”’

The Generals’ dual meet
record is 2-2 so far and Coach
Franke expects them to do well
in ODAC play, of which the
Generals are _ undefeated.
Franke didn’t express much
concern for the rest of the dual
meet play. He said that Lyn-
chburg was the only real threat
to the Generals in the ODAC
league.

The next home match for the
Generals will be against Liber-
ty Baptist at 8 p.m. Thursday in
the Warner Center.

help the Generals as they have
never been able to find a consis-
tent face-off man.

Unmentioned up to this point
has been the solution to the
team’s depth and defensive pro-
blem. That solution lies in the
yet unproven talent of the
freshmen players. Emmer says

it’s too early to assess any
outstanding freshmen but it ap-

' pears that all the freshmen out

for the team are capable of con-
tributing to the squad. He’s
quick to say that no one’s posi-
tion on the team is safe until the
final cuts are made and that
some of the freshmen may ac-
tually push out some of the
returnees for-a place on the
squad. Having observed fall
practice sessions for the first
time, the coach was able to in-
vite out only those he felt were
capable of playing at the varsi-
ty level. Of the 42 invited to try
out for the team, 10 must be cut
before the start of the season.
These cuts are something that
Coach Emmer says will not be
easy.

When asked the purpose for
the team’s planned trip to
Florida over winter break, Em-
mer offered two reasons. The
first is because the weather in
early February doesn’t allow
the team to practice outside as
much as it should. The second
reason is closely related to the
first. The team plays 10 games
between March 2 and April 4
which comes out to two games a
week. W&L has the reputation
of being a team which gets bet-
ter as the season goes on. This
year, however, it’s important
the team be ready early. Em-
mer feels the team has to be
strong in the early part of -the
season So as not to be faced with
a do or die situation come the
beginning of April. The Florida
trip will be used to concentrate
on conditioning and to. get the
necessary field work, which is
important to the early success
of the team.

As far as the team’s schedule
this year, Emmer sees it as
very demanding and challeng-
ing. When confronted with the
Statement that W&L usually
plays a weak schedule for a
Division I school, the coach
pointed to such teams as UNC,
UVa, Hofstra, Rutgers and
Syracuse. All of these teams are
likely national contenders and
are by no means weak. The
coach stated that W&L must
beat these teams if it hopes to
be invited to its eighth con-
secutive tournament. Emmer

The Ring-tum Phi, Feb:1, 1979, Page 9

Lax team opens training;
match on Mar. 2

also added that the majority of
the team’s “‘big’’ games are
played at home, which should
be an advantage.

When asked which team on
the schedule he saw as being the
biggest test, Emmer quickly
responded with Syracuse
University. He said that they
were ranked right behind the
Generals and are loaded with
talent. He fears W&L might
take the Orangemen too lightly,
something he will try to avoid.
He also said that playing
Syracuse early would provide a
test for the- caliber of lacrosse
the Generals are able to play.

Finally, when asked to give
an overall view of the upcoming
season, the coach said, ‘‘We’re
going to be competitive with
everybody. We’re going to need
good games from our key
players. The intangibles will
make or break us.’’ He says it’s
important the team maintain a

eg

silt (hai?

high degree of unity and a sense
of poise. He sees winning the
close games as being crucial to
the success of the entire season.
The feam must establish itself
early, get the confidence it
needs 0 win, and continue winn-
ing. Emmer added, ‘‘March is
very important. We’re going to
have to go after the other teams
and get it quick.

The Generals will tune up for
their March 9 season opener
with an exhibition game against
Chesapeake Lacrosse Club on
March 2. Both games will be
home and are, as Emmer
pointed out, very important in
establishing an early con-
fidence in the team. On paper
the Generals look as good as
they’ve been in years. Their
fate, however, will be determin-
ed on the field. With a coach as
successful and experienced as
Jack Emmer, the 1979 Generals
could surprise a lot of people.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

More Noise

After last Tuesday’s I.F.C. meeting, many fraterni-
ty officials are calling the city authorities “indian
givers” and worse — with good cause. Since the fall,
fraternities have had a ‘‘spotless record” overall (ac-
cording to Dr. Thomas Imeson of the City Council) as
regards noise violations. Yet the city authorities
again refused to consider any relaxation of the str-
ingent noise ordinance presently in effect.

In an attempt to pacify local residents the I.F.C.
limited weekday fraternity parties to Wednesdays on-
ly. There have also been greater efforts by the frater-
nities to negotiate directly with residential neighbors.
But ‘“‘waving the olive branch”’ appeared to have no
effect at all on the Council. Instead of helping form a
compromise, Imeson implied that fraternities should
be grateful that Lexington’s noise rules aren’t
stronger — in short, that fraternities had better be
satisfied and keep quiet. And though he invited frater-
nity officials to debate the subject further at the coun-
cil meeting tonight, Imeson added that he will con-
tinue to oppose any change in the noise ordinance.

The City Council’s treatment of W&L fraternities
strikes me as cavalier in the extreme. Recent good
conduct seems to have made no impression at all. As
a result of all this, the I.F.C. is now considering an
end to the ‘“‘Wednesday-only” rule on parties. And
why not? Now that cooperative efforts have stalled,
and fraternities are still subject to the same police ac-
tion, they might as well be able to choose which nights
to have their parties. ;

Despite rumors to the contrary, Dr. Imeson’s
message did include one positive note. There have
been several complaints of “‘selective enforcement”
of the noise ordinance by the police. Imeson stated
that the Council will certainly investigate any in-
cidents of this type. That’s about the only break
they’re ready to give — and it isn’t much — but it’s a
start. .

As the big party weekends approach, we urge all
fraternities to take action; report any evidence of un-
fair noise enforcement to the City Council. Also, try to
attend tonight’s council meeting, or offer your com-
promise suggestions to an I.F.C. member. In any
event, it is our hope that some sort of agreement can
be worked out, before the ‘‘spotless record’’ of the
fraternities is destroyed in a wave of anger and an-
noyance with the city fathers.

Letters To The Editor

Local resident comments on
“architectural embalming” of Henry St.

The following letter was received by the
Lexington News-Gazette this week, respon-
ding to last week’s housing feature in The
Ring-tum Phi. We thank The News-Gazette
for their permission to reprint the following.

Dear Editor:

An article entitled ‘‘Lexington’s Housing
Game” appeared in the January 26, 1979,
issue of the Ring-tum Phi. It seems a member
of the W&L coaching staff has bought a
number of lower-priced houses on Henry and
Randolph streets and is remodeling them. He
plans to rent them out to those able to pay
higher rents, thereby displacing the present
tenants. Several of these can find no place to
go, according to the article.

On more than one occasion, I believe, the
landlord in question has stated that he feels he
is doing the city a service in upgrading local

Admissions Committee

clarifies points
To the Editor:

Although I commend the Ring-tum Phi staff
on an excellent and very entertaining year, I
would like to protest the small, but I believe
significantly misleading coverage in last
week’s paper of the Freshman Admissions
Committee’s report to the E.C.

In all fairness to the Office of Admissions, it
should be made clear that Mr. Hartog has not
reorganized that department in order to
minimize any group’s input into the admis-
sions’ process as was insinuated. The purpose
of the reorganization and the resulting change
in the Admission Committee’s function was to
raise the office’s professional and com-
petitive effectiveness — a move both Monk
Hamra and I explained to the E.C. and fully
support. Secondly, the Phi article was incor-
rect in reporting that Monk and I “had no
firm reply’’ when asked whether our positions
as student representatives to the committee
should continue. As Tom McCarthy noted in
the E.C. minutes, we both believe that our
positions are still an important source of stu-
dent opinion on admission policies and only
recommend that representatives be ap-
pointed by the Executive Committee in the
spring so they can attend the committee’s
early fall meetings.

Thank you for this opportunity to clarify
last week’s article and the new approach
taken by the Office of Admissions.

Respectfully,
Douglas Byrd ‘79

property. “‘I think it was once a beautiful
street’ the article quotes him as saying. I feel
certain comments are in order.

Being familiar with Lexington since 1948, I
feel many of its streets on _ which,
predominantly, persons of African or mixed
descent live are still some of the more attrac-
tive sections of town. In summer they are
shady, and life is lived there, I hope, with less
of a compulsive concern for materiality and
its symbols. Houses, after all, attest to the
love lived inside ‘them and around them,
rather than to the price of the building
materials. I am by no means praising poverty
or insecurity; rather I am suggesting that by
causing such insecurity and distress by
displacing Lexington citizens, such renova-
tion may not be doing Lexington a favor at all
unless alternative low-priced housing is
available.

There is, it seems to me, a thin line between
architectural restoration and mere architec-
tural embalming. Neighborhoods have
organic lives all their own, and Lexington’s
poorer neighborhoods (speaking only of
material poverty) have a right to their in-
tegrity.

Honor System
Questioned

Dear Editor:

Are you sure W&L has an honor system?

I’m notsosure. "

My family owns Flo’s Market (formerly Ci-
ty Market at the corner of Henry and Ran-
dolph streets) and we were appalled at the ac-
tions of two W&L-‘‘gentlemen’”’ Monday night.

The soda machine at the front of the store
had just been refilled and the money taken
out. Two students came into the store, made a
small purchase and proceeded to get sodas
from the machine. Both of them came back in
and reported the machine did not work. One
student had gotten a soda and the other said
that after depositing his 35 cents he could not
get a soda.

Upon checking the machine we found only
40 cents deposited — not 70 cents as the two
students had firmly stated.

Fine example of an honor system, huh?

The W&L fencers lost a real close one to Navy last week. Their next match is against W&M and James

Madison on Sunday.

Fencers foiled by Navy —
Entertain Duke on Sat.

by Bill Sherwin

Dr. James Worth’s fencers
almost took a very close fencing
match from the U.S. Naval
Academy J.V. team this past
Saturday afternoon. Losing it
by a score of 16-11, the club held
Navy to a much closer match
than anyone expected.

The foil squad, led by captain
Will Mackie and freshman
Steve King, lost in matches to
Navy’s foil squad by a score of
5-4. Worth was very pleased
with the foil performance,
noting that Navy had a profes-
sional fencing coach.

In epee, Washington and Lee
was victorious, pulling an upset
victory over the men from An-

napolis by the score of 5-4. Win-
ning for the squad were Dave
Hepler, Paul Nathan, and Bill
Sherwin. Worth praised the
unit, saying ‘“They can really be
proud to have beaten Navy’s
epee, which was really a fine
team. I am very pleased with
the way they fenced.”’

In sabre, the team was not so
fortunate, posting a 7-2 loss.
Winners in this weapon were
Dave Bryant and Dave Garner,
with one victory each.

In an interview Tuesday,
Worth indicated his pleasure
with the team as a whole. He
pointed out that while W&L took
on the J.V. squad for Navy,
most of their fencers saw fairly

regular action with the varsity,
and the varsity team, although
a little better, ‘“‘is really not
much different from the J.V.”’

Captain Will Mackie viewed
the meet as a valuable ex-
perience for the club. “They got
us into it, we will really be
ready for this weekend.”’

Mackie was referring to the
vigorous fencing schedule plan-
ned for the fencers this Satur-
day and Sunday. On Saturday,
the team will fence Duke
University at 1:30. Originally
scheduled to be held in the
Warner Center, due to opposi-
tion from gym officials, it was
decided to hold the meet in
Cocke gymnasium at VMI.

On Sunday, the team is
scheduled to fence William and
Mary and James Madison
University at James Madison.
The meet is scheduled to begin
at2:30p.m.

Swimmers drop 5th

Washington and Lee’s swim-
mers dropped a 69-44 decision to
powerful William and Mary in
Williamsburg on Saturday. The
highlite of the meet for W&L,
now 1-5, was the diving of
sophomore Jay Diesing who
was first in one meter required
diving with 151.6 points and in
the one meter optional diving

with 242.0 points.

His total score of 393.6 easily
qualified for the National
Championships. Other first
place finishers for W&L includ-

ed co-captains Keith Romich in
the 200 (1:50.1) and 500 free
(5:00.6), and Chip Hoke in the
100 free (10:23.6).

No change in
noise ordinance

(continued from page 1)

Imeson invited disgruntled
fraternity members to attend
Thursday night’s City Council
meeting. He said students have
‘‘a right to change something,”’
although a committe upon
which he sits will recommend
“that the rule not be changed.”

The announcement by Imeson
came as a disappointment to
fraternity members who feel
they had made “concessions”
during the fall term in hopes of
reaching a compromise.

Said Imeson, “despite a
spotless record during that
period, there will be no quid pro
quo.”’ Imeson did mention after
the meeting that he has an
“interest in fairness’ and if
there was some indication of
selective enforcement he would
“certainly take action.”’

With the possibility that good
behavior by fraternity houses
will not help the situation, many
representatives at the meeting
discussed the possibility of
removing the ‘party only on
Wednesday restriction.”’

Executive Committee presi-
dent Beau Dudley agreed that
removal of the restriction is a
possibility, and that although he
is “extremely disappointed”
and “sees room for improve-
ment,” he is not ready to give

up yet.

The situation could become
bad with Fancy Dress around
the corner and Winter Weekend
a few days off. The problem will
be even worse in the spring
when houses party with win-
dows open.

Dudley initiated negotiations
between the fraternities and the
City Council last fall. When
questioned about his plans for
the future, Dudley said he
wants ‘“‘to sit back and think it
over for a few days.”

Stirring no less debate, if not
as heated as the noise ordinance
problem, were a list pf proposed
changes for Rush regulations.

One rule drew the most
debate: “There shall be no
pledging until after the fourth
rush date.’, Although the final
decision on the pledging debate
will not be made until spring,
points were made both for and
against the amendment.

While several representatives
pointed out that the present
system prevents freshmen from
seeing more than one house, op-
ponents of the measure said the
new idea would cause money
problems because rush would
be more intensive for a longer
period of time.

A decision on the proposal
will be made at an I.F.C. Rush
Committee meeting in the spr-
ing after the Student Activities
Committee approves a_ ten-
tative Rush calendar.

I.F.C. president Jim Davis
also announced that the Frater-
nity Inspection Committee will
inspect more than three houses,
the normal number, Thursday,
February 1’ The _ inspection
could pose a problem for many
houses that have parties
scheduled for Wednesday night.

Steve Abraham, representing
Delta Tau Delta, proposed that
the present rule calling for an
automatic fine upon receiving a
summons be dropped. The mo-
tion was amended and passed
unanimously.

Fraternities receiving a sum-
mons for noise violations may
now appeal the fine to the I.F.C.

Financial Aid Loans Available

Interest free loans are now
available to any student ac-
cording to Van Pate, Director of
Student Financial Aid at W&L.

Pate says he has processed
close to 100 students recently
who would have been ineligible
before the Middle Income Stu-
dent Assistance Act went into
effect Nov. 1.

Prior to Nov. 1 the govern-
ment only paid interest on stu-
dent loans if the adjusted in-
come of the student’s parents
was less than $25,000 a year.

Now, according to Pate, the

government will pay interest on
a loan to any student who can
find a bank willing to lend him
money because the $25,000 in-
come ceiling has been lifted.
The interest rate is currently
seven percent on student loans.
An undergraduate can bor-
row up to $2,500 a year, and can
borrow a miximum of $7,500
over 4 years. Graduate students
can borrow $5,000 a year. The
maximum amount of debt a stu-
dent can accumulate is $15,000.
A student does not have to

begin paying back a loan until
he has finished his education.

A growing number of students
have been defaulting on loans in
recent years. The loans are in-
sured by the government so tax-
payers pick up the tab when a
student does not pay back his
loan. Although the nationwide
rate of defeault is around 13 per-
cent for student loans, it is only
3 percent among Virginia
students.

According to Pate, this is
because students in most cases
can only get loans from banks in
their hometown which they
have dealt with over a period of
time.

Doyon Receives Appointment

Gerard Maurice Doyon, pro-
fessor of art history at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, is the new director of the
University Center In Virginia’s
atelier in Paris — an art and
music studio on the right bank
of the Seine.

The atelier is available to
teachers of music and art from
the University Center’s 15
member institutions for periods
ranging from three months to a
year. They pay no rent, and are
charged only for utilities and
services.

 

Funds for the facility were
donated to the University
Center in 1966 by the president
of Steuben Glass, Arthur Amory
Houghton Jr., to be matched by
the member colleges and
universities. The University
Center has its atelier on a 98-
year lease.

It is located across from
Notre Dame Cathedral, two
blocks south of France’s new
complex for the arts, the Centre
Pompidou.

Doyon, art professor at W&L
for 11 years, studied extensively
in Paris, and his Ph.D. disserta-
tion at Boston University was
on the mural paintings of the
French artist Theodore
Chasseriau. Doyon is also a
painter himself, and among his
one-man exhibitions was a show
at the Galerie Palmes in Paris.

Doyon will carry ou his duties
as director of the atelier from
W&L in addition to his full-time
teaching and chairmanship of
the art division of Washington
and Lee’s fine arts department.

EC Gives

Lacrosse
Team

$1,000

by Randy Smith

The student Executive Com-
mittee dispensed $1,300 from its
EC Funding account Monday
night, the bulk of the money go-
ing to Washington and Lee’s
lacrosse team for a training trip
to Florida over the winter
break.

By a close 6-5 vote, the EC
gave the athletic team $1,000 to
help pay for the Florida trip,
which W&L lacrosse coach Jack
Emmer said would cost a total
of $5,750.

Monday’s controversial vote
marks the first time in memory
that the student EC has funded
an intercollegiate sport.

Emmer told the committee
that $2,400 had been collected in
contributions from parents and
alumni. The team raised
another $1,000 from the sale of
visors, and found $1,000 in the
lacrosse team’s travelling
budget.

Emmer said he hopes to raise
an additional $200 by collecting
a $1 cover charge that will be
assessed to see an unnamed
band in the Cockpit next week.

“The players are already
paying for their own meals, so
anything the EC can do will cer-
tainly help us on our way,” Em-
mer said.

After some discussion about
other possible sources of
money, Rob Calvert, senior EC
representative, proposed that
the EC “give them (the lacrosse
team) the money that they need
now ($1,350) on a condition that
some attempt be made to repay

_ it in part” by charging a small

President Huntley To Address IFC

by John Billmyre

President Huntley will ad-
dress the Interfraternity Coun-
cil Tuesday, Feb. 13 concerning
the condition of fraternity
houses and the Alumni Inspec-
tion scheduled for spring.

In making the announcement
about Huntley, IFC president
Jim Davis urged ‘‘all represen-
tatives to attend with officers.”’

The announcement came as a
surprise to many at Tuesday
night’s meeting, but Davis said
“a number of us have met with
President Huntley already “

The Judicial Board had a full
slate.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon was
presented a bill for damages
amounting to $449 by Hollins
College and placed on
two.weeks social probation by
the IFC as a result of a party
held on Jan. 13 at Hollins’
Moody Center.

According to a letter of com-

plaint from Hollins to the IFC,
+wo prints, a partition in the
men’s room, and several signs
have either been destroyed or
are missing.

“An ice cream machine was
broken into and ice cream was
distributed by members of SAE
and several other fraternities,”’

said Billy Webster, SAE presi-:

dent.

Although Webster said, ‘“‘We
accept full responsibility for the
party and will pay for the
damages,” several Judicial
Board members felt the SAE’s
were not the only party to
blame.

Charles Terry, IFC junior
justice said, “‘It’s just like the
PiKA party at Sweet Briar,

’ everyone showed up.’’ Webster

The considered proposal to
change Lexington’s existing
noise ordinance was officially
defeated at the Lexington City
Council’s Feb. 1 meeting.

Councilman Thomas C. Im-
eson, speaking for the Public
Safety Committee, said that
they recommended no change
in the statute because the or-
dinance was no more restrictive
than others in surrounding com-
munities and less restrictive in
one instance.

City Council Makes

In short, ‘‘the committee does
not recommend any change in
the noise ordinance,” Imeson
said.

Imeson pointed out that the
Charlottesville noise ordinance
was enforced through the use of
a decible meter that registers
sound.

City Attorney William O.
Roberts then questioned the en-
forcability of this method and
further stated that he did not
want to ‘‘break legal ground.”’

“It is fair to say that there

was some disappointment
regarding the decision,’ said
Imeson, who attended an Inter-
fraternity Council meeting Jan.
30, where he _ informed
Washington and Lee students of
the decision. Their feeling was
that the Lexington Police
Department was
discriminating against frater-
nities, he added.

“This council does not in any
way condon or permit any
discriminatory enforcement of

supported Terry’s claim and
added, ‘‘Six other fraternities
and many Hampden-Sydney
students showed up.”’

In another discipline related
situation, Davis suggested that
fraternities make a move to
discipline themselves.

Decisions made by the IFC
are subject to review by the Stu-
dent ‘Affairs Committee as
Davis pointed out. He suggested
that decisions made by frater-
nities could be reviewed in the
same manner.

3 File for
EC Law

Position

Three first-year law students
submitted their names to the
EC Monday night for the posi-
tion on the committee being
vacated by Jenelle Mims.

Mims resigned from the EC
last week citing a heavier-than-
expected work load as the
reason for her resignation.

Mims will leave the commit-
tee when a replacement is
selected next Monday.

Students React to
New Fence Around U.C. Debates Grade Review

McCormick Library

by Dave Murray

“They were tearing this place
up when I was a freshman and
they’ll be tearing it up when I
leave. I’ll never get to see it in
one piece.”’

That’s one man’s reaction to
the fence that has recently gone
up around the old McCormick
Library and restricted access to
the back campus.

Frank Parsons, assistant to
the President, says that the con-
tractor in charge of re-modeling
the back campus is trying to be
fair about the situation. There is
a lot of exterior work left to be
done on the back campus. The
outside of the old library will
not be changed, but extensive
landscaping, parking, sewerage
work and other facets of the job
will begin soon.

At first glance it seems that
the fence is very inconvenient
for students who wish to get to
the back campus or wish to get
to the Co-Op from somewhere
on the back campus. But so far
at least there are ways to beat
the set-up.

Tuesday morning there was
an opening in the part of the
fence stretching between the
back of Newcomb Hall over to
Reid Hall. So from Reid Hall or
anywhere on the back campus it
was possible to reach the Co-Op
without having to circle around
the buildings on the colonnade.

If you chose this direct route
you found a fence blocking your
way at the entrance to the Co-
Op. However you could go
aroung toward the bookstore
entrance and slip in between the
boxwood and the side of the Co-

Op and jump up on the porch.

“It’s a C-school plot to cut
down on J-school Co-Op.runs,”’
said Joe Dashiell.

Apparently too many
students caught on to this ploy
and somebody didnt like it.
Tuesday afternoon when the
direct route was taken again it
was a little harder to negotiate.
There was a tangle of barbed-
wire laying on the ground
behind the boxwood.

Perhaps it was this barbed-
wire and several other pieces
which barred access through a
hole in the fence next to
Newcomb Hall that prompted
one student to talk of Gestapo
agents, and of Steve McQueen
slipping through the fence to
freedom.

Some students looked at the
fence as a blessing, however.
One. J-school major said, “If
I'm cruising from the Co-Op to
Reid Hall and I’m almost late
for class, that damn fence is the
best excuse I’ve ever had to can
class.”’

Access to the back campus
from the gym was easy enough
for some students. Instead of
circling all the way around to
the Colonnade some were slipp-
ing through the construction
yard beside the old McCormick
library.

The inconvenience caused by
the fence is just one part of the
picture. Several students were
concerned about how the chain-
link fence looks. Reddes Taper
even went so far as to say that
the fence is,’ ‘“‘A blasphemy to

the beauty of the campus.”
Well, you can’t please
everybody.

Contact Debate
Slated for Wed.

A debate between two na-
tionally known commentators
on opposite ends of the political
spectrum, former U.S. Sen.
Eugene McCarthy and “Na-
tional Review’’ publisher
William A. Rusher, will take
place next week at Washington
and Lee University.

Their debate, sponsored by
‘‘Contact,’’ the student organiz-
ed symposium which brings na-
tionally known commentators
to the W&L campus, will take
place next Wednesday, Feb. 14,
at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

“Directions for the 1980s’’ will
be the topic for the debate
which will include discussion on
subjects likely to affect the U.S.
in the next decade.

McCarthy, a two-term con-
gressman and U.S. Senator
from Minnesota, ran for Presi-
dent in 1968, opposing the Viet-
nam War, and again in 1976, as
an Independent questioning the
two- party political system.

William A. Rusher, publisher
of the “National Review”’ since
1957, also writes a syndicated
column, ‘‘The Conservative Ad-
vocate.” He received New York

University School of Laws’s
“Distinguished Citizen Award”’
in 1973 for ‘‘his able articulation
of the conservative viewpoint.”

Dudley vs. Atwood

by David Greer

The University Council voted
to change the wording in the
Faculty Executive Committee’s
Grade Review guidelines to
make the rules a stronger state-
ment of students’ rights.

The adopted guidelines say
that “It is the expectation that
each professor will’ adhere to
the listed guidelines. The U.C.
voted to substitute ‘‘It shall be
the responsibility of each pro-
fessor to” for that phrase.

The U.C. also voted to change
the wording in the phrase ‘‘The
Head of the Department may
then discuss the grade’ and
substitute ‘‘shall’’ for “‘may.”

Dean Edward C. Atwood said
that the faculty EC will vote on
the changes and pass their
recommendation down to the
faculty at its meeting in March
for final approval.

Atwood said that the faculty
EC did not vote on the changes

The SAB recently announced
that special photographs will be
on sale for the 1979 Fancy Dress
Ball, with its special theme “A
Taste of the Big Apple.’’ The
photo is a night shot of Times
Square in New York City, as it
was on January 27, with
“WASHINGTON AND LEE
FANCY DRESS 1979 — A
TASTE OF THE BIG APPLE”
featured on the color graphics
board atop Times Square. The
message is surrounded by a red
border and features a large ap-
ple in each of the four corners.

For those interested, this
board is the same one used to
display special messages on
New Year’s Eve as well as the
opening credits for Saturday
Night Live.

The photos are due to go on
sale Wednesday, February 14,
and are being offered as a
special limited edition. Only
five hundred have been
ordered, SAB officials reported.
Prices for the photos will be an-

 

nounced at a later time.

at its last meeting because it did
not have written copies of the
change.

Student body president Beau
Dudley said he felt that
‘responsibility’ is a stronger
word”’ and that “‘it is too easy to
weasel around ‘expectation.’”’
He added that “In the minds of
the students, it’s a significant
change.”

Atwood said he felt that the
department head should have a
chance to reject a student’s re-
quest if he felt it was il-
legitimate and pointed out that
there is no punishment involved
for professors not complying
with the guidelines.

Dudley said that under the
present system, a student has
no place to go if a professor does
not want anything to do with a
case, and hoped that the
guidelines would give the
students an alternative. ;

Dr. Robert W. McAhren said

that he did not think bringing in
the department head ‘‘would
achieve any of the objectives on
the list.”’

Dudley said that the grade
review guidelines would be a
preventative measure rather
than a corrective one and that
“frivilous complaints would
water down the power of the
rules.’”’

Dudley stressed that the
guidelines should be followed as
every student had a right to
grade review and a syllabus.
Dean William J. Watt said that
requiring a prescription of
course plans is an infringement
on a professor’s rights. Dudley
pointed out that the guidelines
would only require a general
outline of course expectations.

In other UC business, it was
announced that Thanksgiving
Break would last for a full week
next year and that exams would
start ona Wednesday.

Students Sentenced
On Drug Charges

Two Washington and Lee
graduates, a current senior,
and a Lexington man were
sentenced to jail terms on drug
charges last Wednesday in
Rockbridge County Circuit
Court.

W&L 1978 graduates Spencer
Clark Jackson, 23, of Lexington,
and Chris Reid, of Garden City,
N.Y., and senior James W.
McElroy II, of Fairfax, Va., will
all serve six-month jail terms in
lieu of penetentiary sentences,
and will be on probation after
their release. McElroy will be
allowed to finish school before
he begins his sentence. Jackson
and Reid are to report to the
county jail by Saturday.

Sale of marijuana, the charge
upon which all three were con-
victed, is a felony in Virginia
and carries a sentence of five to
40 years in the penitentiary,
plus a fine of up to $25,000.

The Lexington man, John D.
“Nakkie”’ Keller, 21, was con-
victed of an accomodation sale,
a misdemeanor offense. He

 

    

Mon. - Sat. 9 - 9, Sun. 10-7

received a one year jail
sentence with 10 months
suspended.

All four had previously plead-
ed guilty to charges that they
had sold marijuana. Wednes-
day’s hearing was an opportuni-
ty for the court to hear
testimony from undercover
agents and character witnesses
in an attempt to determine
whether the drug sales should
be classified as a felony or as a
misdemeanor accomodation
sale.

The four were arrested
following an undercover in-
vestigation by State Police
which began in December 1977
and concluded in May 1978.

Jackson was introduced to
police undercover agent Peter
Moorman by Curtis Green, an
acquaintance formerly living in
Lexington. Commonweath’s At-
torney Beverly C. “John’’ Read
said that Green has been given

immunity on other drug
charges.

Law Women Deal With Special Housing Problems

pe meeeneste:

by Stuart Snyder

Rebecca Dolins, a third year °

law student, ‘‘lucked out’”’ last
year when she found an ‘‘ideal”’
place to live this year.

- “But it had not always been:

that easy,’”’ she added. In her
first year she had to sift through
the list of landlords and places
to rent, not knowing which ones
were acceptable for her.

This is not a specific problem
faced by one female law stu-
dent, but one encountered by
the whole law school, male and
female alike.

It is particularly troublesome
to the first year student who
lives a great distance from Lex-
ington and is not familiar with
the ropes, according to Susan
Gray, another law student and
initiator of last year’s pilot pro-
gram to help female law
students find housing.

“The University is helpful in
that it gives the law students a
mimeographed sheet of all
known available places to
rent,”’ she said. ‘‘But,’’ Dolins
added, ‘‘the list is impersonal in
that it neither gives a real
evaluation of what it would be
like to live in the places nor is
the list current.

“Hopefully things will be dif-
ferent this year,’’ speculated
Dolins. She is presently the
head of an organization that will
try to evaluate area housing
and give estimates of the condi-
tions of the housing for students
searching for places to live.

Since the organization
presently only encompasses
law students, the survey being
conducted right now has only
been circulated in the law
school. In fact, according to
Cindy Fausold, a law student
and president of the Women’s
Law School Organization, the
surveys are due February 10,
1979.

According to Dolins, this
survey will help alleviate the
major probelm of landlords
choosing not to advertise. They
prefer to deal by ‘word of
mouth,’ which means that

 

 

many students are often exclud-
ed, she said.

This is not the first year of the
organization. Last year it was
spear-headed by Susan Gray. In
fact, originally it was started to
help just the female law
students, said Gray.

According to Gray, it was
organized because of one major
problem: the difficulty of
female law students in getting a
place to live. “Places are hard
enough to find in a town the size
of Lexington,”’ she adds,. “‘but
some people just will not permit
girls to rent from them for
various reasons.”’

Last spring, the organization
sent out a survey similar to this
year’s. The response was better
than expected, Gray said.

Then, with the help of Nor-
man Mohler, Director of
University Services, the
organization compiled a pilot
list.

According to Gray, Mohler
helped for a while, but then he
became too busy to be any help.
So, they were left on their own.
Unfortunately, it floundered,
said Dolins.

Dolins said that starting too
late was the key factor in last
year’s failure. She adds, ‘‘this
year we have started earlier
and are hoping for much better
results.”

Under the proposed system,
the files will be kept constantly
up to date by use of filing cards.
Invalid cards will be removed
and replaced by valid ones,
Dolins said.

One of the major problems at
present is getting a permanent
office set up, said Dolins. One of
last year’s problems was not

The Ring-tum Phi, Feb. 8, 1979, Page 3

open to the law students right

now, ‘‘ideally we would like to
help anybody,” states Dolins.
“Right now we have our hands
full.”’

“Our objective is not to
replace the current system, but
to provide a viable alternative
for the new and returning law
student who comes in March or

 

“Places are hard enough to find in a

town the size of

Lexington, but some people just will not permit girls to

rent from them for various reasons.”

SS

Presently, a prospective law
student receives from the
University a list of landlords
and places to choose from. But
it is up to the student to
negotiate with the individual
landlord, whether by mail or in
person, which is a disadvantage
to the student who comes from
any distance, said Gray.

having a permanent telephone,
according to Fausold. ““We had
to use the telephone in the Stu-
dent Bar Association and then
go chasing all over the school
for recipients of the calls,’’ she
adds. Ultimately they would
like to have one phone of their
own.

that the system will ‘‘run itself,

instead of off the novelty of the»

idea.”’

neighboring girls’ colleges
presently compose about one
percent of Washington and
Lee’s student body. ‘heir
numbers vary from term to
term, but they still require
housing during their stay.

According to Mohler, girl ex-
change students are advised to
seek university housing, but the
university does not
automatically help them. He
says they have to find housing
like any other student.

“We try to help them when
they come to us,”’ said Mohler.

According to Mohler, three of
the twelve girls are living in the
Woods Creek Apartments with
room for two more. He added
that the Woods Creek Apart-
ments are the only suitable
university housing for females.

Mohler said, ‘‘we feel
obligated to the girls par-
ticipating in the program, but
they have to come to us to get
help with housing.”’

Masieal Mainstream

Much has been written as of
late about the apparent unwill-
ingness of most major labels to
invest any amount of time-or
money into the ‘‘breaking-in’”’ of
new or unknown jazz acts. Col-
umbia, for example, may be
willing to “take a chance”’ on a
comeback album by an already
established artist like Dexter
Gordon, but the road to success
for most young artists generally
leads directly to one of the
many small independent labels
that have been formed in reac-
tion to the inertia of the “‘big-
gies.”’

Until last December, the jazz
market had been dominated by
two labels, Pablo and ECM,
both of which had distribution
deals with major labels (Pablo
with Atlantic and ECM with
Polydor and, more recently,
WEA). Well, as the old saying
goes, it’s time for the “‘big two’”’
to move over and make room
for the new kid in town, Inner
City. In the course of the last
two months, Inner City and its
affiliates (Classic Jazz, Choice,
and Aural Explorer) have
released no less than 23 albums,
ranging from the staid tradi-
tionalism of Arnett Cobb to the
pure funkiness of Hubert
Eaves.

It’s hard for any one person to
rave unreservedly about Inner
City’s releases as a whole, since
they represent such a broad
sampling of today’s interna-
‘tional jazz market, but, to quote
another old saying, there is
definitely ‘‘something for
everyone’ on Inner City. Some
of the standouts to date have
been Art Farmer’s The Sum-
mer Knows, a proudly tradi-
tional program which features
delightful versions of ‘“‘Alfie’’
and the title track (from Sum-
mer of ’42) and, on the more
modern side, slightly fusion- es-
que releases from such
previously unknown artists as
Jeff Lorber and Ryo Kawaski.

Inner City may or may not be
the ‘‘fastest growing label in the
world” (to quote their press
releases), but they are filling a
void in the jazz market that has
been empty for far too many
years. One can only hope that

 

their success will inspire the
rest of the independents to keep
up the proverbial fight and, in
the long run, maybe even bring

about a new surge of interest in:

jazz on the part of the major
labels.

New Wave!

On Friday night the W&L community is in
store for a rare treat. Playing in the Cockpit at 8
p.m. will be a real live new wave band. En route
from Atalnta to New York’s CBGB’s, as opening
act for Devo, the Swimming Pool Q’s will play

the Cockpit.

This once in a lifetime opportunity to ride the
New Wave will cost W&L students $1.00 and

others $2.00.

Says the Atlanta newspaper of the Pool Q’s,
“Their guitar, saxophone and lyrical imagery
bring to mind Captain Beefheart during his
Trout Mask Replica period, but the Q’s sound is
more accessible. Band leader Jeff Caldor says
that, ‘‘At heart they’re good old boys.”’

In any event this 5-pc. New Wave band, com-

plete with a female vocalist,

called a

‘phenomenon unto themselves” promises to be a
lot of fun. Friday night, 8:00, In the Cockpit.

The Washington and Lee Film

Herzog’s The Great Ecstasy of
the Sculptor Steiner and Louis

Friday and Saturday, February
9th and 10th, at 8 p.m. Both

will take place in classroom

by Mark Mainwaring
and Robin Meredith

over my $7.50 almost solely in
anticipation of the opening act
— Triumvirat. I was what you
might call a dedicated fan back
then, since Triumvirat was
playing exactly the sort of
music I loved at the time For
the most part heavy, extended
electronic concept pieces that
touched ground only when ab-
solutely necessary. I just knew
the first part of the show would
be worth the money; besides, I
figured I could always leave
before BTO came on and pound-
ed my eardrums into oblivion.

Triumvirat never showed. My
efforts to get my tickets refund-
ed were to no avail. I sat
through one and a half hours of
Bachman-Turner Overdrive,
AND I even enjoyed it — but I
still felt betrayed.

A La Carte initially caused a
similar reaction. It started out
well enough, with a slowly ris-
ing electronic crescendo of the
opening track (‘‘Waterfall’’). It
soon became all too obvious,
though, that this was not the
same Triumvirat I had known

other two major directors in the

were represented recently in
the series by Chinese Roulette
and The American Friend.

Herzog is the most mystical
of the three, and generally
selects unusual subjects (the
world of the deaf, for instance,
or a man who refuses to move
although the volcano beneath
which he lives is about to erupt)
in order to show people living at
their limits, and to explore what
these limits are.

The Great Ecstasy features
Walter Steiner, considered the
finest ski jumper in the world,
in a meditation on human
physical movement and our
yearnings for flight, for
transcendent experience. Her-
zog narrates his own film, set-
ting up implicit parallels bet-
ween Steiner’s risk-taking and
creativity under extreme
pressure, and his own.

The main feature of the even-
ing is Louis Malle’s Zazie
(1960), a zany French comedy
about a precocious little girl
who goes to visit her uncle in
Paris where she encounters a
series of potentially shocking
social and sexual situations, but
remains unflappable.

Malle, the director of the
recently distributed Pretty
Baby, has a history of making
movies on taboo subjects which,
through his treatment, become
humanized and even accep-
table. His early movie The
Lovers (1958), with Jeanne
Moreau, helped break the
ground for a frank presentation
of sexuality in serious film.

The Film Society has selected
its next two films: Peter
Watkins’ magnificent Edvard
Munch, a movie about the life of
the Expressionist painter, and
Orson Welles’ conflation of
Shakespeare’s Henry IV and V
plays, Chimes at Midnight, in
which Welles himself plays
Falstaff.

From The Bookstore

A recent article I read on the
phenomenal success of the
Blues Brothers album, “‘Brief-
case of Blues,’’ currently the
top selling album in the coun-
try, included a dubious apology
from the music director of radio
station WNEW in New York.
Although that station was one of
the first to play the L.P., and
was largely responsible for its
pre-Christmas start in air-play,
this fellow said in looking back
that he wasn’t sure the Blues
Brothers succeess was fully
justified.

He lamented Joliet Jake and
Elwood Blues’ satire on the
form, but his feelings were mix-
ed because the musicians back-
ing up the duo are truly the best
blues combo that Warner
Brothers Records could have
assembled — lead off by Steve
Cropper on guitar. This music

director’fellow evidently felt
that these two upstart come-
dians deserve their success far
less than the real bluesmen who
have been and indeed still are,
toiling away in black alleys and
back rooms from Chicago to
New Orleans.

In my opinion the ap-
propriateness of Jake and
Elwood’s success story is a
moot point as long as their
album leads novices on to the
wealth of blues music available
on records. There are blues
recordings dating back to the
second decade of this century,
which is really remarkable. The
origins of the blues are obscure
and undocumented, but it is ac-
cepted that the form dates back
long before jazz. The blues is a
rural southern outgrowth of
slavery, originating in_ free-

Steve Abraham, junior EC
representative, disagreed. ‘‘we
just can’t give money to the
lacrosse team and not expect
other teams to come to us,”’ he
said.

Abraham added that ‘“‘this
money (the request for $1,350)
is over half the money we have

left in the EC Funding ac-

count.”

Several EC members asked
Emmer about the possibility of
refunding some of the money at
a later date.

“‘We don’t want to feel there is
a hatchet over our heads to re-
fund the monies,’’ Emmer said.
But the coach did say that he
thought it would be possible to
refund part of the money.

Calvert’s original motion to
give the lacrosse team $1,350
failed by a 4-7 vote. :

A new motion to give the team
$1,000 passed, however, 6-5.

Voting in favor of the motion
were: Calvert, Murphy, Will
Mackie, sophomore EC
representative, Charlie Scott,
freshman rep., EC president
Beau Dudley, and law school
representative Jenelle Mims.

Voting against the funding
proposal were: Keesler,
Abraham, EC secretary Tom
McCarthy, senior represen-
tative Rob. Benfield, and EC
vice president Bill Tucker.

Absent from Monday’s
meeting was Bob Willis,
sophomore EC representative.

The EC also gave $300 to the
Ring-tum Phi to help finance
the student newspaper’s Student
Housing Supplement, scheduled
to be published next week.
Tucker registered the only vote
in opposition to the funding re-
quest.

Further discussion of the

Several fraternities express-
ed concern about the mounting
number of incidents at parties
involving VMI cadets. The
Judicial Board is trying to
locate an emergency number to
call when cadets get out of

The board also decided to en-
force the present rule that

Jay Blumberg, director of
W&L’s Dance Marathon, spoke
at the meeting.

Blumberg said, ‘I would like

added, ‘‘we can’t reach our goal

Although there will be a

Blumberg made a plea for
dancers in order to make the

noted the inspection results
marked a ‘“‘significant improve-

Repercussions from the noise
ordinance problem are still be-
ing felt. A copy of the IFC’s let-
ter to city council was cir-
culated at the meeting.

Davis asked all fraternities to
submit a list of scheduled par-
ties so that Murph, W&L’s proc-
tor, can monitor the noise levels
of parties and prevent confron-
tations with the police.

Murph will issue one warning
to house, after which any warn-
ing will result in punitive action
by the IFC.

Davis also reminded frater-
nities that in order to play
amplified music, they must a

Text of Letter to City Council

 

At the outset let us thank you on behalf of the Interfraternity
Council and the student body as a whole for considering our recent
proposal regarding a change in the noise ordinance.

nance unchanged.

After presenting the matter to Council on September 21, we
were informed, quite correctly in a strictly legal sense, that any
change in the ordinance would not be in the form of a ‘compromise’,

but would instead be a change in the law as applied to everyone in

Lexington.

Gramatic decrease in the number of complaints, and more importantly
the fact that not a single summons was issued for violation of the

ordinance until this month after it became known that Council was

rejecting any change in the law.

Councilman Imeson formally announced the decision at the
Interfraternity Council meeting on January 30.
also stated that our improved conduct had played no part in the

decision of Council, which was simply that we would have to live

under the present ordinance.

the noise ordinance,”’ said Im-

eson. “It seems fair to all
elements of the community.”
Imeson arrived late at last
Tuesday’s IFC meeting where
he delivered the committee’s

verdict to the fraternity
representatives.
Saying that fraternity

members would be treated like
any other member of the com-
munity, he refuted claims of
“capricious enforcement” of the
ordinance by police. Hé added
that even though the frater-
nities showed good faith by
maintaining a record: of good

behavior, it would not
necessitate a change.

Imeson then invited unhappy
students to Council’s Thursday
meeting, which few attended.
The reaction to the decision, as
expected, was not favorable. In
response, a letter was written
and delivered to City Council
which summarized student opi-
nion about the Council’s “lack
of faith.”

The letter, addressed to the
City Council, was signed by IFC
president Jim Davis and stu-
dent body president Beau
Dudley and was read aloud by
Mayor Charles F.. Phillips.

When finished, he said that ‘‘it
is not a question of three or four
nights of civil disturbance a
week as opposed to six or seven.
There will be zero nights of civil
disturbance.”’

Phillips added that the abuse
given Imeson at the IFC
meeting was “‘uncalled for” and
that he thought an apology to
Imeson was in order. Imeson
then said, ‘‘I regret that the IFC
interpreted the ruling as it did.”

The Mayor later commented
that he invites any student to
pay taxes, vote and become a
member of the community. “If
they want to kick us all out of of-
fice, that’s fine,” said Phillips.

THE

Indoor Track Team

 

RING-TUM PHI

_ to run on Saturday

by Greg Branan

Winter track gets under way
this Saturday at Lynchburg Col-
lege’s indoor track.

“Its too early to tell,’’ was
Coach Norris Aldridge’s
response to how the team is
shaping up. He indicated that
after Saturday’s meet he would
have a better idea as to where
the team is headed. Aldridge
also noted that it is difficult to
compare this team to another
as he has not seen any others in
the ODAC conference. He did
say that the team “‘should be as
good or better than last year’s.”’

One reason for that statement
is the added depth in the weight
events, sprints, jumping events,
and hurdles. This added depth
makes these events the team’s
strong points, with the excep-
tion of the triple jump. The
General’s top jumpers were lost
to graduation. The weak events
are the distance runs. This is
due primarily to “‘lack of depth
as well as one top runner com-
ing off an illness,” according to
Aldridge.

Top returnees include two of
the team’s tri-captains, Stewart
Atkinson and Jack Norberg, in
the 60, 220 and 440 yard dashes
as well as the mile and 440 yard
relays. Also returning to the 60
and 440 relay are Jeff Brown
and Chris Leiser. Again running

This year’s schedule holds on-
ly two meets, this Saturday’s

Taking part in this Saturday’s

There were 1000-1500 delegates

Most of the discussion at the
conference centered around the
implications of the new football
‘‘Super-Conference”’ in Division
1 and the restrictions Title IX
imposes on co-ed schools. But
as far as Division III is concern-
ed, Coach McHenry was most
enthusiastic about a ruling con-
cerning finaggial aid. Effective
immediately, any schools in
Division III will have to revise
their scholarship packages so
they are consistent with the
established policy of the finan-
cial aid office for all students.

W&L splits two;
At home Feb. 10

by Bill Whalen

After a 74-72 win over Lyn-
chburg and a 75-63 loss to
Randolph-Macon, the Generals’
record now stands at 13-7 with
five regular season games to
play. In addition to these five
games, W&L will play in the
ODAC Tournament to be held at
Bridgewater on Feb. 22-24. The
winner of this tournament
automatically qualifies for the

The Lynchburg game was
probably the. most important
game of the year for W&L. As of
this writing, Lynchburg has lost
only once in ODAC play, but
still has to play Hampden-
Sydney twice. The Generals,
who have lost three ODAC
games, play three more con-
ference games and should win
them all to finish with a 7-3

financial aid budget will be set
aside for athletics, and quotas
of financial aid recipients for
athletics cannot be established.

As McHenry stated, this is the
way W&L has been operating
since 1954, when athletics were
de-emphasized, and now the
rest of the schools W&L com-
petes against will have to follow
the same rules. “‘It should be a
tremendous equalizing factor
for us,’’ McHenry said.

Before the ruling, a school
could abuse the financial aid
program fairly’ easily.
Hypothetically, W&L could
determine an athlete’s financial
need to be $2500 per year. The
school would offer, say, $1200 in
direct grant, $300 in work-study
money, and $1000 in loans.
Another school with a different
policy might offer the candidate
$1200 in direct aid, then dip into
the athletic department budget
for the other $1300, so it
amounts to a $2500 grant.

schools in the ODAC did not sup-

to appear likely that W&L and
Lynchburg will meet in the
semifinals of the ODAC Tourna-
ment, with the winner more
than likely to face Hampden-
Sydney in the championship
game.

The Generals’ remaining
schedule follows like this. After
tonight’s game at Emory &
Henry, the Generals are at
home on Saturday, Feb. 10
against Bridgewater. W&L
hosts Eastern Mennonite, in
their final home appearance, on
Tuesday, February 13. The
Generals end the _ regular
season on the road at Maryville
on February 17 and Oglethorpe
(Ga.) on February 19.

Washington and Lee needs to
win seven of their last eight
games (including three ODAC
Tournament games) to reach
the 20 win mark for the third
straight year.

Swimming

The Washington & Lee Swim-
ming Team will return to action
this Saturday at Warner Center
in a tri-meet against VMI and
Old Dominion University. For
the swimmers, who currently
hold a disappointing record of
one win and five losses, Satur-

last home event of the 1978-79
season. Read next week’s Phi

Fencers spear VMI 16-11

by Bill Sherwin

The Washington and Lee fenc-
ing team took its first victory
from VMI this past weekend in
a tri-fencing meet with UVa.
The meet was held at Cocke
gym at VMI. The club dropped
its match to UVa 16-11.

Dr. James Worth stated that
the UVa team was “very
strong” but also said he was
very pleased with the per-
formance against VMI.

Standouts for W&L were
freshmen Dave Hepler and
Steve King, both of whom
posted 5-1 records in epee and
foil, respectively. In sabre,
Dave Bryant and Dave Garner
were both 3-3 overall. Once
again, Worth had special praise
for team captain Will Mackie,
who in spite of a case of
mononucleosis managed to win
two out of three bouts in foil.
“Will really did a fine job for
us,”’ said Worth. ‘‘He is a very
dedicated and talented fencer.’’

This coming Saturday, the
club faces James Madison
University in what will be its on-
ly meet to be held in the old gym

this year. The meet begins at
1:30, and if the team is vic-
torious, it will hold a .500 record
for the season.

Lax team to take

Lacrosse Coach Jack Emmer
said that the Executive Com-
mitee’s $1,000 contribution to
help defray costs for the team’s

trip to Florida is definitely a one

shot deal.

Emmer also said that every
effort will be made to pay back
the F.C. for at least part of the
money. A small admission fee
will probably be asked for at
least at the first home game,
and there will also be a per-
formance of Burr Datz and
Friends in the Cockpit on Satur-
day with proceeds from a $1
cover charge going to the

lacrosse team.

According to Emmer, the
players will be paying for their
own meals. The money that has
been raised will go to renting a

New rules for Div. III

(continued from page 9)
San Francisco, he immediately
began to politick for the
measure, and it passed the Divi-
sion III members 83-64.

McHenry also proposed that a
limited Spring Football prac-
tice be held without pads, but
this measure was soundly
defeated. Another proposal, to
limit out-of-season practice for
Water Polo, Soccer, and Wrestl-
ing, was withdrawn before the
vote.

But the financial aid rule will
be ‘‘very significant for us,”
McHenry said. The other two
divisions, by the way, cut the
number of grants for football
from 90 to 75 in Division I and
from 60 to 45 in Division II.
These moves, along with the

 

Division III ruling, will un-
doubtedly mean that better
players will be lured to the
smaller schools.

Since the rest of the Division
III members will be playing by
the same rules W&L has been
using for the last 25 years, the
level of competitiveness will un-
doubtedly increase. As

Wrestling news:
All is not well

by Chris Sisto

Last week the Generals’
wrestling team dropped their
dual meet record to 2-3 with a
loss to Liberty Baptist. On
Saturday, three W&L wrestlers
placed points in the Pembroke
State Invitational Tournament.

In Thursday’s match against
Liberty Baptist the Generals
were soundly beaten 49-0. Ed
Rogers, who lost 10-9 at 158, was
the closest the Generals could
come to victory. Coach Gary
. Franke said that the previous
tournament win the Saturday
before had a factor in the
devisive loss. “They have a
very good team and we had a
chance to win a few of the mat-
ches. But we were flat from our
tournament win and could not
get anything together.”

Saturday, the Generals went
to North Carolina to participate
in a tournament at Pembroke
State. This tournament did not
keep combined team points, so

lodgings. The team will be prac-
tising at St. Andrews School and
Boarding at the Florida Atlan-
tic University.

Saying that W&L has been a
slow starting team historically,
Emmer stated that the idea of a
trip to Florida was first thought
up by a group of parents. He
went on to say that this year br-
ings a particularly tough March
schedule, which will make
preseason practice that much
more important.

Emmer said that as far as
next year goes, ‘‘the (athletic)
budget is the avenue” to go
down in regards to funding for
another lacrosse trip. He
hastened to say that this year’s
fund raising was only a tem-
porary arrangement.

no school won the event. For the
Generals, Ray Gross won the
142 class with a 3-0 record;
Rogers finished third at 158 with
a 3-1 record and Dan Kniffen
finished fourth with a 2-2
record. The only other General
who won any matches out of the
seven who participated was Joe
Wallace who was 1-2 in the
heavyweight division. Franke
said that his players did well
but that he had hoped for a few
more individual placements.
W&L’s next match is a tri-meet
Wednesday at Hampden-
Sydney against the Tigers and
Longwood College. The match
against Sydney is a league con-
test and is very important: for
the Generals. The league starts
seeding the wrestlers for the
ODAC championships on
February 20, so it is important
for the Generals to win now in
order to earn a place there This’
weekend the Generals go to
North Carolina for matches
against Davidson on Friday and
Catawaba on Saturday. Franke
said, ‘‘we hope to improve our
dual meet record with four dual
meets in four days.’’ The next
and last home match for the
wrestlers is February 14
against James Madison.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Progress, progress...

NH aR 5

It is our sincere hope that the students and faculty
enjoyed the quiet of the past three weeks. With the
library move completed, we almost forgot what it was
like to dodge newly-constructed fences, irascible con-
struction workers, and the like. But never fear — a
new obstacle course has been erected for our amuse-
ment, and from the looks of things it’s going to be a
part of the campus for some time.

Rest assured that this isn’t a stunt to direct more
shoppers into the Bookstore; it’s not even an attempt
to enclose Dean Atwood within the confines of
Newcomb Hall. The new fences are merely the begin-
ning of a ‘face-lift’, which will see McCormick
Library transformed into the Commerce School. And
it is our understanding that the large amount of
fenced-in space will be necessary for the construction
workers to complete the task as quickly as possible.

Bass Construction Company (who completed the
new library six months ahead of schedule) is again in
charge. They have until October, 1980, to complete the
renovation. But, by taking this large area for work
space, the C-school may be able to move into its new
quarters as early as the summer of that year. As a
result, present convenience has again been traded for
future success.

All of us support the growth of the university. Still,
it would be nice to see the fence lines moved back as
soon as possible — after all, we thought the majority
of this project was to be on the inside. In the mean-
time, we urge students to hang on to the idea of
‘‘progress’’ as they stumble about the campus. Until
some enterprising soul prints a dependable road map,
it’s about all we’re going to have in the months to
come...

If you walk past the corner of Nelson and Main, you
may see several people distributing flyers to the
passers-by. They call themselves the ‘“‘Citizens for the
Protection of Lexington,” and they are currently pro-
testing the renovation plans of the First National Ex-
change Bank. We quote their letter in the passage
below:

The First National Exchange Bank has begun demolishing the
Hopkins Building and intends to replace it with a modernistic struc-
ture. The bank plans to build a parking lot along Nelson Street, in-
stall drive-in tellers, and stick a postage-stamp size plaza at the
corner of our main intersection. Cars in the parking lot will be in
full view from Nelson Street. The drive-in tellers will create serious
traffic problems. And the plaza will attract drunks and litter. The
new building will be set back from Nelson Street, leaving the un-
sightly side of the State Theatre fully exposed...

I see more than a little wisdom in these complaints.

Letters To The Editor

Distressed reader puts
Phineas to the test

To the Editor of the Ring-Tum Phi:

I’ve been.a pretty consistent reader of the
Ring-tum Phi since I moved to Lexington; I
think it’s a good student newspaper, in-
formative and well-written. But I didn’t like
Mr. Phineas’s last column. (Before I tell you
why, though, let me say that I hope I’m not be-
ing humourless about this. Detecting irony in
a text is rarely a sure-fire thing, and if
Phineas’s remarks about— for example —
pinko poets were meant in jest, I can only
plead critical incapacity. )

I guess what disturbed me most about the
column was the tenor of Phineas’s remarks
about the Film Society. Phineas has lam-
basted the society before, and I must admit
I’m beginning to wonder whether he has per-
sonal reasons for repeatedly denouncing an
organization which has always seemed to me
a rather harmless and well-meaning one.
Surely there can be nothing terribly wrong
with occasional cultural events taking place
in, and being supported by, a university?
Phineas’s column implied that students at
Washington and Lee are uninterested in eg-
ghead movies. I hope he’s wrong — I hear, at

any rate’ that attendance at the Film Socie-
ty’s showings is running far ahead that of the
Malibu Beach series. Phineas should at least
remember that, though largely funded by the
(perfidious? ) Glasgow Fund, the society was
created by and for students.

I don’t think this is an argument over taste;
Cries and Whispers isn’t exactly my idea of a
fun time either, and Superman’s high on my
list of movies-to-see. I guess if Phineas wishes
to attack the elements of higher culture
within our midst, it’s okay by me — though I
thought his brand of anti-intellectualism went
out with the McCarthy era. I just wish he’d
sign his name to his column. No mother loves
a Sniper. And if, to borrow Phineas’s idiom,
he’s going to fill the air with cries and
whispers and moans and groans, he should
have the courage to sign his name to his or-
ribili favelle. Anonymous spite columns are
neither funny nor responsible.

Come on, Phineas! If you’re such hot stuff,
come on out of the closet. We'd like to get a
look at you.

More Letters To The Editor

Dear Unknown Fans:

There is a need to openly express our ap-
preciation to you for the outstanding support
you demonstrated at the Washington and Lee
Clinch Valley Basketball Game.

Knowing that you have traveled the great
distance from Miami, to attend our game, we
felt the least we could do is say thank you. We
feel privileged to know that since you have
supported such great teams as the Pittsburgh
Steelers, the Boston Celtics, and the Alabama
Crimson Tide, that we are included in this
select group.

You have given our games a new dimension
that will help us develop a home court ad-
vantage for the first time. We hope to con-
tinue to give you something to cheer about
and we also sincerely hope that the
“Unknown Fans’’ will become a W&L Basket-
ball tradition. Let it be known that any team
visiting W&L must be prepared to face the
“Unknown Fans.”

THE BASKETBALL TEAM

To The Editor:

I was terribly dismayed by last week’s ac-
tions of the Faculty Executive. Committee.
How this committee can act as it does — or
perhaps fail to act is more appropriate — is
beyond me. It seems to me that a committee
which has discussed a proposal to some ex-
tent should be able to comprehend the chang-
ing of two words. I must have greatly mis-
judged the abilities of these members of the
committee.

The grade review proposal comes at a par-
ticularily interesting point in time. Not only is
the Faculty E.C. avoiding the clarification of
present policy, it is also condoning the action
of several members of the faculty. Even the
Faculty E. C. must admit something is wrong
when a certain history professor waits until
the day of the next test to hand back the
results of the first one. ;

I urge the committee to examine the pro-
posal with a greater sense of responsibility.

Sincerely,
John Brown’79

3 WE&L Students Convicted on Drug Sale Charges

(continued from page 2)

Moorman testified that he
first bought a $35 ounce of mari-
juana from Jackson on Jan. 19,
1978, in a restroom in the
University Center.

Moorman purchased four
more ounces and an ounce of
what Jackson told him was
hashish (which later proved to
be marijuana) in Jackson’s
apartment the next day.

Jackson told the court he
thought that Moorman was “‘all
right’’ because he had been in-
troduced to him by Green.

The defendant had several
character witnesses appear on
his behalf. Among the witnesses
were Van H. Pate, director of
student financial aid at W&L,
and Gerald J. Darrell, W&L’s
director of food services.
Jackson worked for Darrell in
the dining hall for four years,
and knew Pate through finan-
cial aid counseling.

Also appearing in Jackson’s
defense was his uncle, Bill
Jackson, of Hartford, Conn.,
and James Jones, president of
Light Industries, where
Jackson has been employed

since graduation.

Defense attorney Bernard J.
Natkin said that Jackson had
stopped selling drugs and that
later attempts by Moorman to
buy more marijuana had been
unsuccessful. He asked for pro-
bation.

Read, however, argued that
the character witnesses did not
know ‘‘the other seamy side’’ of
Jackson. He argued for a
fiveyear term in the state
penitentiary and a substantial
fine. :

Judge Rudolph Bumgardner
sentenced Jackson to five years
in the penitentiary on both in-
dictments, to run concurrently.
But he suspended four and one
half years of the sentence,
ordering a six-month term in
the county jail and a five-year
probation period. Jackson will
also have to pay court costs.

Judge Bumgardner gave the
same sentence to Chris Reid,
who sold a half pound of mari-
juana to Moorman for $230 on
Jan. 26, 1978.

Reid had met Moorman in the
Cockpit when looking for
Jackson. He later found a wallet
belonging to Moorman with the
undercover agent’s real name
inside it in the Zeta Beta Tau
fraternity house, where the sale
took place.

Episcopal minister, and a fami-

testified in his behalf.

His employer at Light In-

character witness.

The Lexington News-Gazette
reported yesterday that Reid
had tried to arrange a plea
bargain to substitute a substan-
tial fine for the jail sentence,
but Commonwealth Attorney
Read had turned down the offer.

McElroy was found guilty on
two felony charges of selling
drugs and on another felony
charge of possession with intent
to distribute.

He sold two ounces of mari-
juana to police undercover
agent Michael Countes, who
went to the ZBT house looking
for Jackson or Reid on March
22. :
Countes went to McElroy’s
apartment one week later and
bought another ounce for $35.
The agent testified that he saw
scales for weighing the drugs,
and that another person came
to buy marijuana while he was
there.

McElroy and Countes met for
the last time on May 1, when the
agent bought another ounce of
marijuana and a “Thai stick’,”’
identified himself’ and placed
McElroy under arrest.

The W&L senior testified in
court that he had been selling
marijuana for about a year and
a half when he was arrested. He
said that he had bought a $600
electric guitar and an amplifier
with the profits from his drug
sales.

Character witnesses who ap-
peared in McElroy’s behalf
were two W&L professors—Dr.
William W. Pusey, professor of
German, and Dr. David G.
Elmes, professor of
psychology—and both his
parents.

All testified that they saw “no
problem” with McElroy break-
ing the law again, and the stu-
dent himself said that he now
fully realized the serious nature
of his situation.

He, too’ will serve six months
in jail and be on probation for
five years when he graduates in
June.

NUMBER 17

President Huntley Expresses
Concern About Fraternities

by John Billmyre
and Bruce Vail

‘‘Fraternities,’’ said
Washington and Lee university
President Robert E. R.
Huntley, ‘‘provide, for better or
worse, the core of the social life
in numbers and tone.’ But,
W&L’s president added, ‘‘time
is about to run out on the frater-
nity system in general, and for
a certain few fraternities in par-
ticular.”’

He offered his statement ‘‘not
as a threat, but as a predic-
tion.”

After almost half of a school
year that has seen fraternity
presidents arrested for noise
violations, fraternities placed
on social probation for unsight-
ly structural conditions and
fraternities banned

Shortage of Available Low
Cost Housing in Lexington

by Mike Lavitt

Lexington has a serious shor-
tage of satisfactory low cost
housing and city residents with
low or fixed incomes will have
to wait one year or more to ob-
tain a-suitable place to tive, an
investigation by WLUR-F'M and
the Ring-tum Phihas revealed.

But City Manager John V.
Doane told the student media
organizations that Lexington’s
housing situation is no worse
than in other cities.

There are three federally sub-
sidized, rent controlled housing
projects in Lexington, but all
three have long waiting lists.

The largest complex is the
Willow Springs Apartments,

located on Route 39 north of
Lexington. The-other two are
the Lexington- Mountain View

Terrace Housing Project and

the Lexington House Apart-
ments, which is open to senior
citizens and disabled people.

Welfare officials say that a
housing allowance is built into
weHare payments. The housing
allowance is fixed for each com-
munity and should be sufficient
to pay for good housing, said
Betty J. McClure, director of
the Rockbridge Area Social Ser-
vice.

For instance, Mrs. McClure
said the housing allowance is
higher for Lexington than for
Buena Vista, but the allowance
in Richmond is higher than that

from

neighboring girls colleges for
disorderly conduct, Huntley ad-
dressed the Interfraternity
Council and _ fraternity
representatives Tuesday night.

Huntley called the occasion a
“special meeting’ and men-
tioned that it has been ‘‘seven or
eight years since I last met with
this group.”’

Explaining the purpose of the
visit, Huntley said, “I come
because I have worries I want
to share with you.”’ His concern
was with the overall deteriora-

tion of fraternities and the ~
fraternity system.

And he posed to the assembl-
ed group, “Do you think frater-
nities have the capability for
self-government?”

Huntley told the students that
the University administration
and community has_ been
“relatively tolerant, over the
years, of youthful exuberance. -
But change has occurred. It is a

Contact Debate
Rescheduled

‘The sudden illness of former
U.S. Sen. Eugene McCarthy
caused the cancellation of the
Contact debate Wednesday
night between him and William
Rusher.

The debate has been ten-
tatively rescheduled for March
6, Contact member .Tom Wall
said.

McCarthy’s secretary told
Wall that the former senator
was hospitalized with internal
problems, possibly an intestinal

virus or appendicitis.

Wall said that Rusher was
willing to reschedule and said
that he had indicated that ‘‘both
of us are fired up to doit.”

The debate is sponsored by
Contact, the student organiza-
tion that brings nationally
known speakers to W&L.

The topic for the debate is
“Directions for the 80’s’’ and
will include discussion on sub-
jects likely to affect the country
in the next decade.

Mull Buys R.E. Lee Hotel

by Joe Scott

Last Friday, Feb. 9, owner-
ship of Lexington’s Robert E.
Lee Hotel.was transferred to
restaurant owner Clyde Mull
for $190,000.

The deed, registered in
Rockbridge County Circuit
Court at 2:45 p.m., gives posses-
sion of everything on the
premises to Mull including all
furniture.

The hotel complex at 30 S.
Main Street. was formerly own-
ed by the Robert E. Lee Corp.
which bought the hotel on
December 15, 1961 for $125,000.

The corporation paid that
amount off in monthly in-
stallments of $920. A remaining
amount of $11,299.69 not yet
paid will be assumed by Mull as
part of the sale. ;

The hotel complex consists of
the hotel itself, a beauty parlor
in the hotel run by Katherine
Hostetter and three stores tron-
ting Main Street which are
Tilson Real Estate, Printers
Ink, and an unoccupied space,
formerly known as the Bamboo
Garden Restaurant. The City
Market, a small grocery store
separate from the complex at 17
N.- Randolph Street is also in-
cluded.

Dance Marathon Plans

Set For

by Dave Murray

If you haven’t thought about
registering for the First Annual
W&L Muscular Dystrophy
Dance Marathon, you’d better.
You don’t know what you'll be
missing.

Entertainment Chairman
Burr Datz has assembleda
wide range of musicians for the
weekend of March 23-24. There
will be something for everyone.

Leading off Friday night at 8
p.m. will be Jimmy Bishop and
Turning Point. Following the
soul band is Lucky Pierre’s
Blues Band.

Jay Blumberg, chairman of
the event, says door prizes will
be given away also (Jack
Daniels and steak dinners).

Inside Evans Dining Hall
there will be free beer and free
food for dancers.

To dance, a person has to
come up with $30 in pledges.
Couples are encouraged, says
Blumberg, but there should be a
large number of single people
involved also.

Those wishing to watch can
come in for a cover charge and
drink 16 ounces of brew for 50
cents. Blumberg hopes this will
offset some of the costs of the
live entertainment.

When Lucky Pierre’s Blues
Band stops playing at 4 a.m.
Saturday, there will be a rest
period. Dancing will begin
again at 6. From 8 to 10 Satur-
day morning WREL will be
broadcasting live from Evans
Dining Hall.

Datz, who gave a benefit
Saturday night that raised over
$200 for MD and for the lacrosse
team’s trip to Florida, may join
The Blue Grass Express for

Brown’s Taming kills Shakespeare’s spirit

by Parker Potter

As my high school English
teacher Sara Pfaff used to say,
“All great books were written
this morning.” Indeed, a great
work of literature wears its age
well; its central issues should
seem as vital today as they did
the day it was written. .

Many directors have atte ted

to ensure that their rendition of -

Shakespeare has that ‘‘written
this morning’’ feel by dressing a
play up to fit the times. While
this technique can be suc-
cessful, it is a way fraught with
pitfalls (witness last year’s
mutilation of As You Like It at
the hands of the National
Sheakespeare Co any).

Often the best modernization
is a radical retooling of a story a
la Romeo and Juliet a.k.a West
Side Story. Realize, as well,
that many of Shakespeare’s
own plays were reworkings of
older stories...

En tout cas the matter at
hand is Hunt Brown’s senior
thesis production of Taming of
the Shrew. I am afraid that
Brown’s noble attempt to bring
Shakespeare to Washington and
Lee must be counted as another
sacrifice (if well intended) to
the Great God Modern Dress.

Where Brown’s Taming is
perhaps vitalized by modern
garb and some almost inspired
low humor, it fails to tap the
real comic vein in Shakespeare,
the language of the play. It is a
rare character in Brown’s Tam-
ing who feels at ease with the
words of Shakespeare on his
lips. :

The central problem with the
production was telegraphed by
the initial dialogue between
Lucentio (Doug Veasy) and
Tranio (J. Mark Turner). Each
managed to get too carried

away with the flow of the lines .

to pay any attention to in-
dividual words or phrases. ..
A pleasant change of pace
was Bill Rough’s Baptista.
Rough was at ease enough
speaking Shakespeare’s lines to
actually interpret and not recite
them. Further, his ease with the
language allowed him to in-
tegrate thought, word and
gesture. The result was the type
of supple, vital performance
that Shakespeare deserves even
after 350 years. ‘
Both Maria Soltus and Pepper
Tharp as Baptista’s daughters
Kate and Bianca score partial
successes. Miss Tharp seasons
Bianca’s sweetness at the
beginning, with enough in-

 

   
  

   

sincerety that her emergence
as the real shrew at the end is
believable. As are many of her
fellow actors, though, Tharp is
buffaloed by the Elizabethan
diction.

Maria Soltus’ Kate is in many
ways a delight. Her physical

sense of the shrewish, then
spirited, but tame Kate is ex-

Kate Petruchio and Baptista, a

traordinary. Her eyes always
sparkle, the gestures and
nuances are always on target. If
only she could speak the lines as
well as she can look them.
Larry Loveridge’s Hortensio
was an admirable effort.
Loveridge like Rough, let the
language (not the rhythm of the
language) speak for itself. By

   

mong others, prepare for the highly visual banquet scene which

mitigates, in small part, the disappointment of Taming of the Shrew.

Entertainment

letting the language be master,
Loveridge seemed in control of
what he was saying. (Let us not
forget that Sheakspeare is the
genius in question here...)

In attempting to age himself,
Bill Fishback played a well-
nigh unintelligible Gremio.
Many of his speeches were
swallowed up by the voice he af-

   

photo by David Favrot

 

fected to portray his age.

Stan Nolan’s difficulties as
Petruchio are emblematic of
those so endemic to the whole
production. For all his vigor,
Nolan wasn’t able to make his
own the language. of
Shakespeare. Especially ag-
gravating were those instances
where his enunciation became
exageratedly crisp for no
understandable reason.

Among the _ assorted
domestics and flunkies (most of
whom seemed to have been
played by Nick Martin and
Louis McCarter), Nick
Dubrowski as Grumio stood out.
Dubrowski was one of the lucky
few in the play who felt at ease
enough to develop an entire
character. His combination of
clowning and cutting insight
embody the Elizabethan know-
ing fool.

As far as McCarter and Mar-
tin go, their weaknesses and/or
excesses describe well the
essential dilemma of the play.
Whatever he played, McCarter
carried on in a too similar
rolicking swish. Martin, though
sincere as he always seemed,
just didn’t project.

The play was funny enough in
places, in a frantic way. The
mob scene of footmen at
Petruchio’s house or Mc-
Carter’s swish or a bit of
Fishback’s often tiresome

King of the Gypsies: An exotic dog

 

by Dick Barron
Instead of giving us a unique

sinsight into the world of the
-momadic tribes of gypsies, as

one might expect, King of the
Gypsies shows us somebody’s
poverty stricken version of The
Godfather.

The elements of a great story
— power struggles between
families, marriage partners
chosen for children by op-
portunist parents, and renegade
offspring, ready to leave tradi-
tion behind— are there in abun-
dance. Al Pacino made a name
for himself in the hugely suc-
cessful and_ beautifully
rendered Godfather series as
the young man who didn’t need
the trappings of a family
power— who wanted to make
his own way in life, free of ar-
chaic customs and the conflicts
involved.

But like Eric Roberts in Gyp-

sies Pacino was unable to
escape the grip of the family.
The films of the Godfather
series were at once heavy and
crisp, morose and triumphant.
This was due, in large measure,
to their superbly talented sup-
porting casts and director Fran-
cis Ford Coppola’s ability to
mold everything into powerful
art.
We’re not so lucky with King
of the Gypsies, a film of high
aspirations which falls flat. A
dancing gypsy opens the film
and prances through various
transition scenes, but he proves

Musical Mainstream

The Who’s Peter Townsend is
currently working as musical
director for a stage version of
Tommy, now playing in Lon-
don‘s West End. Townsend had
been asked over to see the show
during rehearsal, and was im-
pressed enough to get personal-
ly involved...

After he finishes his next LP,
Bob Dylan will be issuing
records on his own CBS-
distributed custom label, Ac-
complice Records... Elvis
Costello just finished a highly
successful British tour with a
sold-out performance at the
Hammersmith Palais in Lon-
don. Joining Costello for his en-
cores were Martin Belmont of
the Rumour and Rockpile’s
Dave Edmunds.

Meanwhile, opener Carl
Perkins is no longer on the

to be only a hollow reminder
that the director was never
really able to fit random scenes
together.

Much like an old gypsy Cad-
dilac, the film moves in fits and
starts from the New Jersey
flatlands in the 1940’s to New
York City in the seventies,
never building, just side-
stepping itself.

The supporting cast, headed
by Judd Hirsch as an overbear-
ing failure of a father, is
ponderous at best. All of the
characters, including Shelly
Winters as the Gypsy Queen,

completed their first UK tour in
three years, and are heading

Roberts’ unacceptably youthful
mother, seem to be rehearsing
their lines in anticipation of bet-
ter future performances.

Okay, the newcomer, Eric
Roberts is impressive. His
screen impact — the ability to
grab the viewer’s attention — is
strong, and if anybody saves the
film, he could do it. But nobody
can win when his: own side
seems to be working against
him. :

Graphic prints by Turner
McGehee opened last Friday to
a well attended reception and to
the delight of the Washington
and Lee Art community. This
show is quite unusual in that on-
ly infrequently does a recent
graduate receive the honor of a
showing in duPont Gallery. Mr.
Ju of the Art Department ex-
plained this event by saying
that it is rare that a student is
willing to devote the time and
dedication to mastering an art
as Turner has.

The show consists mainly of
silkscreen prints made in the
last 2 and a half years with
some recent etchings and
lithographs. Many of his pieces
feature scenes from the W&L
and VMI area while his newer
pieces focus on images and ob-
jects not geographically confin-
ed

His silkscreens will be a
welcome relief to anyone who

  

has attended many recent create the

silkscreen shows because the
vast majority of his works are
either handcut stencils or hand-
cuts combined with resists, as
opposed the photo stencils from
artists such as Andy Warhol
which are presently dominating
the field. Resists consist of

- making a stencil on the silk with

a brush or other means allowing
the artist to create a rough and
free or textured effect. This can
be clearly seen in either
‘‘Seediess’’ or ‘‘Night Sky’, in
Turner’s show.

Being a printer myself I am
particularly impressed by the
variety of techniques Turner
employs and the skill with
which they are applied. His col-
or selection and application is
far above the average
undergraduate level and should
be considered one of his strong
points. He succeeds in blending
pastel colors to produce a very
harmonic effect while at the
same time allowing them to

One-act “works in progress”

by R.B. Ramirez

This Thursday and Friday
evenings, in the Boiler Room
Theatre, the University Theatre
will produce two ‘‘works-in-
progress,” Dirty Linen by Tom
Stoppard, and The Ghost Sonata
by J.A. Strindberg. These
plays, both somewhat longer
than one-act in length, are being
presented as projects in the
directing class. Rich Allen and
David Sorrells will direct.

Dirty Linen, a recent offering
from the man who brought us
The Real Inspector Hound,
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
and, more recently, Travesties,
is a Satirical portrait of
hypocrisy, moral perversion
and corruption in high places.
The plot, which concerns (if I
reme er correctly) a group of
MPs meeting in the clock tower
at the House of Parliament
(chez Big Ben), is full of Stop-
pard’s sophisticated humor. We
are confronted with a set of

From She Bookstore

this week brought back vivid memories of the
turbulent Vietnam War years when students
across the country plunged into political ac-
tivism.

And at Washington and Lee:

Silent vigils in front of the dining hall at lunch
hour...Petitions, protest posters and banners
everywhere...large contingents off to
Washington for the huge mass demonstra-
tions...a dozen W&L students training as Mar-
shalls there...Cambodia and Kent State brining
eruptions across the nation...coming to work in
the Bookstore at 8:30 a.m. to see a couple of hun-
dred students meeting on the grass in front of
Lee Chapel...Rumors of plans to blow up
buildings, especially the ROTC.,.Student pro-
testors wrapped in blankets against the early
morning chill patroling the campus all night to
protect the buildings...Large mass meetings in
the Cockpit long into the night...the quiet poise
of student body president, Swede Henberg, who

got no sleep for several days...the bright beauty
of the spring days contrasting with the electric
tension of antagonism towards the faculty and
administration who held to the determination not
to close the University...My personal statement
— over and over — “don't oppose violence with
violence”...the growing feeling that, in fighting
the administration here, the students were begin-
ning to forget about Cambodia and Kent
State...the compromise whereby students were
allowed to take “incompletes” in their courses,
only to discover the next fall how hard it was to
make up the credits...the demonstration in Court

The Strindberg play, Ghost
Sonata, deals also with the
theme of facades, but here the
tone is thoughtful and
serious.Ghost Sonata, an ex-
pressionistic drama in three
scenes, comes from the last
period of Strindberg’s life, 1907,

at a time when the author was
breaking away from his ‘‘mid-
dle’ period of naturalistic
writing, to the role of an ad-
vance man for the expres-
sionistic movement. Without
giving away the plot, we could
say that the play treats the
disturbing paradox of truth and
falsehood: which is more
destrictuve? The play really is
a sort of sonata, for it is written
in three scenes, an accummula-
tion of differing states of mind
in a day in the life of a student

A Taming too tame

 

(continued from page 4)

Gremio were sufficient to pro-
voke laughter, but not enough to
sustain comedy.

Word play lost

The true comic aspects of the
play, Sheakespeare’s sparkling
wordplay and the manner of
Kate’s taming lost. Taming
calls for laughter, but the real
laughter, that which is recalled
after the performance, is
engendered by a’. reflection
which Brown’s production
doesn’t know how to ask us to
do.

Brown’s choice of modern

dress may be at the base of the
play’s inability to communicate
on that deeper level. To attempt
to modernize the play is to bring
yet another pressure to an
already difficult project. Had
the play been allowed to wear
caps, doublets and silk stock-
ings, perhaps the players could
have, through immersion in the
play itself, been inspired rather
than befuddled by the language
of Shakespeare.

‘, No easy task

Let it be known that Brown’s
was no easy task. Any director

Nick Dubrowski, Stan Nolan, and Maria Soltus appear in a scene from Hunt Brown’s Taming as Grumio,

Petruchio, and Kate.

In the end, the girl dies, and
the audience is left to ponder, as
much as the young man, the
strangeness of a universe which
so equitably punishes extremes
both of falsehood and of truth.
The Ghost Sonata is, Sorrells
concedes, a difficult play, both
to see and to direct: in fact, this
difficulty had a great deal to do
with his decision to do the play.
“I wanted to make people
think; that’s what I’m after. It’s

it’s meant to be. It certainly has
been for me.”

Tenants

te Neer ene

by David Greer

Unless you are a_ very
dedicated hunter, you probably
won’t like killing rats in your
kitchen.

Unless you are training in
your spare time to be a painter,
you probably won’t like having
to repaint the house you are ren-
ting, using your own money.

And unless you are used to liv-
ing in an igloo, you probably
won't like having no heat in
your bathroons or kitchen.

Seldon Clarke and his two
roommates, all Washington and
Lee students, don’t like it
either.

Clarke has lived in the house
he presently rents for two
school years now and the
landlady has not put any money
into the care of the house.

The main problems are with
heat and water, Clarke said.

“Right now are pipes are
frozen,”’ said Clarke. ‘‘When we
informed the landlady, she said
that we’re supposed to have a
warming trend soon.”

The pipes have been frozen
since Saturday, and so the
residents only get water from
one tap — and that’s cold water.

Clarke said that they also
have an underground water
leak. Last month’s water bill
was $75, and the city water
department says that this mon-
th’s bill is already over $100..A
man from the city could tell that
there was a leak without even
using a flow meter.

Although the landlady was
told about the problem two
weeks ago, no plumber has
shown up to fix the leak. The
landlady said that she would
reimburse the renters for the
water that has leaked out.

“The house is in a_ nice
neighborhood,’ said Clarke.
“But it’s a dump sitting there
like a sore thumb.”’

There are gas space heaters
in each of the bedrooms, but
they have no thermostats. The
heater in the living room does
have a thermostat, Clarke said.

“If the heater is off and you
want to turn it on, all you do is
stomp on the floor. That turns
on the thermostat,’ he said.

All of the faucets leak, he
said, and the toilets have run
constantly since the beginning
of the year.

They have killed two rats in
the kitchen, Clarke said, and
they also have problems with
the mice.

The oven in the kitchen has
never worked.

The rooms sag, and Clarke
says he can see sags in the foun-
dation.

The paint is peeling in the kit-
chen, and four ceiling tiles have
fallen after being soaked by a
leak from upstairs.

The three tenants pay $175 a
month rent and about $50 a
month for gas. The water bill
for this month could be over
$150.

Clarke said that he would
definitely not live there next
year and would not recommend
the place to anybody.

When asked about any
recourse a student could take or
what to look for in a lease,
Clarke said, “‘What can you do? rn
They’ve got you over a barrel.”’

Landlords have problems
too.

To begin with, they are not all
mean and greedy or just out to
make a buck as quickly as
possible.

If a landlord seems a little
callous at times, it may be
because he had a bad ex-
perience with a student tenant
sometime in the past.

What about the student living
in an apartment in the base-
ment of his landlord’s home
who was prompt to pay his rent,
but skipped town without pay-
ing for his electricity, water or
gas during his last three months
in the apartment, forcing the
landlord to foot the bill?

What about the students who
let the drain clog and water run
over the rim of the shower
upstairs—not a lot of water, but
enough to soak through the ceil-
ing and into the landlord’s
apartment below after seven or
eight months?

What about the ‘‘nice, quiet
student who never caused any
problems,” except that he liked
greasy carry-out fried chicken
and was nice enough to leave
behind a paper bag full of bones
in the middle of the landlord’s
newly installed carpet, creating
a nice, big grease stain when he
was gone?

Undergraduates ~ searching
for housing in town may run in-
to a landlord who rents only to
law students. He refuses to rent
to undergraduates.

His adamance is usually the
result of an unpleasant ex-
perience he had with an
undergraduate. tenant years
ago, but the unpleasant
memory of the student’s loud
parties and penchance for
destructive behavior linger long
after the student is gone.

One landlady got very upset
this year when she found out
that her student tenants had not
one but three dogs on her pro-
perty, even though the lease
specified no pets.

She might have survived the
‘‘no pet’’ lease violation if one of
the tenants hadn’t cursed her
and told her what a “‘dump”’ her
house was.

As the story goes, the student
challenged her to throw them
out. So she did.

Other headaches for the
landlord might be:

—the squirrels in the attic
who are building a nest in the
chimney that his tenants have
not told him about because,
well, it isn’t their house and
they weren’t planning to live
there next year.

—too much paper in the toilet
upstairs so that it clogs and
backs up all over the bathroom
and seeps into the floor.

—tenants who leave food out,
attracting roaches, but not tell-
ing the owner about the pro-
blem until the pests have begun
to take over the house—possibly
never to be completely exter-
minated.

—the short circuit in the faul-
ty electrical wiring that the
students learn to live with until
it sparks into a small fire and
the landlord loses his house and
his tenants.

Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About

the University’s Student Housing Services

University Owned Housing

by David Greer

While looking for a place to
live in Lexington, students
might want to try some of the
University-owned facilities in
town.

The University rents apart-
ments for 178 students in the
Woods Creek complex. Rooms
cost from $625 to $950 a year,
with options on single and dou-
ble occupancy and suite ar-
rangements.

Baker and Davis dorms hold
37 and 45 students respectively
for $575 a year. All rooms are
single, and Baker dorm houses
only law students.

The two Lee Houses hold 33
students together, and cost $525
for a single and $425 for a dou-
ble.

The Davidson Park Apart-
ments, off Nelson Street, com-
monly called ‘‘The Barracks,”’
house married students. There
are 23 units available (two are
condemned and are used for
storage) and cost $100 a month
for a two-bedroom apartment
and $105 a month for a three-
bedroom apartment.

Woods Creek

Some of the residents at
Woods Creek say that there are
often problems with heating
and hot water, but for the most
part, the apartments are not
bad.

Some students have reported
problems with leaking roofs and
others complained of the easy
access that Buildings and
Grounds personnel have to the

apartments. One student found
people living in his apartment
over the summer while he was

' away.

Davidson Park

One couple living in the
Davidson Park Apartments
said that for cheap housing,
their apartment was pretty
nice. They said that it was
large, but that they had to do
some work themselves to make
the place look better.

They said that the walls were
fairly thin and that they had to
put rugs down on the floor to
keep the place warm, but for

the price such improvements .

could be expected. The couple
also said that the University
was quick to fix any problems
they had with the apartment.

An Interview With the
Director of Univ. Services

In an effort to determine ex-
actly what services Washington
and Lee does provide to assist
students in their search for off-
campus housing, the Ring-tum
Phi interviewed William N.
Mohler, director of University
Services, the administrative of-
fice which handles student
housing.

Question: Does the Universi-
ty maintain a current listing of
housing in the area available
for students?

Mohler: It is very difficult to
keep a list of that nature cur-
rent. We do it as often as we can
justify doing it.

Q: How often would you say
that is?

Mohler: I doubt if I could give
an accurate statement on that.
(The listings made available by
University Services) could have

two years old, all you have to of-
fer?

Mohler: That’s all we pro-
vide.

Q: Why doesn’t the Universi-
ty do more to provide housing
information?

Mohler: Maybe we should be
doing more. I don’t deny that.

Q: Will University Services
do more in the future to help
students find housing? And if
so, just what will be done?

Mohler: I have no idea what
will be done. We manage as best
we can.

Q: What role do you think the
University should play in
assisting students find housing?

Mohler: I suppose to be more
thorough and more formal
along the lines and routine what
we’re doing at the moment.

Althought it might be unfair to compare Washington and Lee with
larger schools, our university housing services do seem to trail
behind those at other institutions.

Our University Services office does offer a listing of available ac-
commodations, but they are far from current.

The office also does not really have a telephone for students. The
only accessible phone is in the lobby of Washington Hall.

Finally, University Services lacks a list of rental furniture stores.
However, the official word is to ‘‘check Buena Vista.or Roanoke.”

Understanding a Lease and What It Covers

by Bob Shurack

A lease, strictly speaking, is not a con-
tract, but is a conveyance of an interest in
land, like a deed.

To illustrate this point, look at the sam-
ple lease that is printed on page ---. If that
lease ended at line 12, it would be purely a
conveyance of real estate, with no contrac-
tual element at all. And, as such, it would
be a perfectly valid lease.

According to the law of real property,
the tenant would be legally entitled to
possession of the leased premises for the
Stated term, (although the landlord would
be under no duty to put the tenant in actual
possession by ousting persons wrongfully
occupying the premises), and the landlord
would have the right to the payment of the
full amount of the rent at the end of the
term.

Other than the duty not to evict the. te-
nant or disturb his quiet enjoyment of the
premises, the landlord would have no fur-
ther obligation to the tenant.

If the apartment was in such poor condi-
tion as to uninhabitable, that would be no
concern of the landlord. The tenant would
still be obligated to pay the rent.

This is not surprising if one realizes the
nature of a lease as a conveyance.

The tenant becomes the temporary
owner of the demised premises for the
duration of the term of the lease — he owns
a leasehold — and only he can be liable for
the condition and maintenance of his own
property.

Just as one selling a house or a farm is
not responsible to the buyer for its bad con-
dition at the time of purchase or its upkeep
afterwards, the landlord, as a seller of a
leasehold, has no responsibility for the
condition or maintenance of the property

By the year 1500, all of this was pretty
clear.

By that time, the tenant’s interest had
been elevated to that of an interest in land
— an estate in land — real estate, if you
will.

Landlords and tenants began to insert in
their leases special promises called
covenants. These covenants imposed
duties upon the parties that made them.

- ae : as © @
Ps a t
* be Ey.

 

 

In the sample lease, all of the numbered
paragraphs are covenants. These are the
contractual provisions of the lease. If a
party broke his promise or covenant, the
other party could sue him for breach of
covenant.

But even though one of the parties was
breaching his covenants, that did not
relieve the other party from his duty to
abide by his own covenants.

Thus, if the landlord covenanted to
repair the roof when it leaked, and the te-
nant covenanted to pay $100 a year rent, if
the landlord did not repair the roof, the te-
nant was still bound to perform his cove-

    

nant to pay rent. But, of course, the tenant
could still sue the landlord for breach of his
covenant.

In 1500, that was good contract law.

By about 1600, however, the law of con-
tracts had developed the concept of the
mutual dependence of material promises.
In other words, if Smith agreed to paint
Jones’ house for $100, and Smith did not
paint the house, Jones did not have to pay
the $100.

Unfortunately, this development came
too late to be adopted into the real property
law governing the landlord and tenant
relationship, which had been settled one
hundred years earlier. To this day, lease
covenants remain independent, unless
their dependency is expressly provided

for.

aati

By the use of lease covenants, (contrac-
tual provisions in a lease), the landlord
and tenant may establish duties in addition
to or, with respect to the tenant, in
variance of those very few duties that pro-
perty law will otherwise imply in every
lease.

Property law holds that it is the duty of
the landlord to give the tenant the legal
right to possession and not to evict him or
disturb his quiet enjoyment of the proper-
ty.

These minimal obligations of the
landlord are fundamental to the granting
of a leasehold, and cannot be abrogated or
lessened by express covenant in the lease.

But the landlord may, by express cove-
nant, take on additional duties to the te-
nant.

Property law holds that it is the duty of
the tenant to pay rent and not to commit
waste upon the leased property. The te-
nant’s duty not to commit waste means
that he must maintain the property in as
good condition or better as it was at the
time that the tenant became legally entitl-
ed to possession, ordinary war and tear ex-
cepted.

Not only must the tenant refrain from
committing affirmative acts of waste,
such as ripping up the garden or defacing
the walls, but it is his obligation to make
repairs if necessary to prevent consequen-
tial damage.

Thus, if the roof begins to leak, though
from no fault of the tenant, the tenant must
repair it anyway, at his expense, if to allow
the roof to leak would cause damage to
other parts of the house.

This duty to repair, implicit in the te-
nant’s duty not to commit permissive
waste, may be varied by express cove-
nant. In facet, the duty to repair may be
wholly shifted to the landlord.

In modern urban and suburban living, it
is necessary to prescribe many duties
respecting the reair, upkeep and general
livability of dwellings. By means of lease
covenants, these necessary duties may be
fairly apportioned between the landlord
and the tenant.

The sample lease on page --- provides, in
the case of the letting of an apartment, a
fair and reasonable apportionment of
these duties between the parties.

It should be noted that a written lease is

 

not necessary to create the landlord-tenant
relationship.

An oral lease for a term not exceeding
one year is valid and enforceable.

For example, if it was understood bet-
ween you and your landlord that you were
to rent your apartment for the school year,
he could not force you to leave at any time
before the year was up, even though there
was no written lease.

The landlord may claim, however, that
the lease was not for a one-year term, but
was on a monthly basis (technically known
as a month-to-month tenancy). If such
were the case, the landlord could evict the
tenant upon one month’s notice.

But if the landlord brings a law suit
against the tenant for ejectment, the te-
nant may prove the term of the lease by
producing the landlord’s rent receipts.

Since these may not show what the ac-
tual term of the lease was, the tenant
should create his own evidence of the lease
term by inserting a notation on his rent
checks. For instance, the tenant might
write in the lawer left-hand corner on his
first rent check, ‘Lease: Installment Pay-
ment 1 of 12.”

If the landlord accepted checks with
such memoranda written on them, that
should qualify as evidence of the term of
the lease.

Another way to prove the making of, as
well as the term of an oral or written lease
that has been lost or destroyed is by pro-
ducing a writing, no matter how informal,
which includes the terms of a lease that the
parties have agreed upon.

For example, if you give your landlord a
security depoit and he writes on a scrap of
payment, ‘March 1, 1979, received of
Stanley Student, $100 security for apart-
ment for next school year, (signed) Larry
Landlord,’ and he gives the scrap of paper
to you, this should suffice to provie that a
lease was made for the term of the next
school year.

In the sample lease, there is no mention
of the landlord’s remedies in case the te-
nant does not pay the rent. This is because
the law provides the landlord with a
powerful arsenal of remidies which he
may use against the delinquent tenant.

These remedies are available to the
landlord even though the lease does not
mention them.

For example, if the tenant does not pay
the rent, he may come home one afternoon
to find that the landlord has distrained
(seized and taken away) his stereo and col-
or TV, which he may lawfully do if he
believes that the rent is justly due.

But if the tenant has been able to obtain
a favorable lease, he will have some pro-

tection against a landlord who insists upon

   

 

full payment of rent even though he has not
lived up to his own obligations in the lease.

First, because the landlord knows his
obligations, if he has not met them, he will
be less inclined to invoke the judicial
remedies of distraint, ejectment, or suit
for the rent, because there is a danger of
encountering the tenant’s valid defenses to
any such action.

Second, if the landlord does take legal
action, the tenant may successfully defend
and himself recover damages or obtain
other form of relief.

Since 1974 in Virginia, the lease itself has
been of much less importance in
establishing the rights and obligations of
the landlord and tenant.

This is because in that year, the Virginia
legislature enacted a new, comprehensive
law that governs the landlord and tenant
relationship (the Virginia Residential
Landlord and Tenant Act).

With certain exceptions, this law applies
to the landlord and the tenant regardless of
any conflicting provisions in the lease.

However, and this is important, the law
does not apply at all to leased property
that is occupied as a one-family house. For
example, if five students together rent a
house, the law does not apply and the pro-
visions of their lease will be of paramount
importance.

But if a house is divided up into two or
more apartments, the law does apply.

There is a further complication in that if
the landlord rents 10 or more one-family
houses or, regardless of how many one- .
family houses he rents, if he is not a
natural person, i.e., a corporation, the law
is applicable.

Also exempted from the operation of the
law is housing provided by a college or
university.

Under the Virginia Residential Landlord
and Tenant Act, the landlord may not take
from the tenant as security an amount

THIS LEASE made this 7 day of , 1979,
between , residing at
Street, , hereinafter called the
Landlord and , residing at
Street, , hereinafter called the
Tenant,

WITNESSETH: that the Landlord does hereby let and demise to the Tenant the apartment known as Apart-
ment No. on the floorin the building located at Street, City of Lexington,
for the term of years, commencing on the___day of _. , 1979, at an annual rental
of Dollars, payable in equal monthly installments in advance on or before the___ day of each
month of said term.

For purposes of this lease, the word “‘shall”’ is always mandatory and not merely directory.
The parties hereto covenant as follows:

FIRST: The. Landlord has good title to the demised premises and has the unrestricted right to grant a
leasehold in them.

SECOND: The Landlord, as of the first day of the term, shall place the Tenant in actual possession of the
premises.

THIRD: The demised premises shall be occupied by the Tenant [and the members of the immediate family
of the Tenant] as a private dwelling and for no other purpose.

FOURTH: The Tenant shall pay the rent as above provided, and shall deliver or mail payments of rent to the
Landlord at the following address:

FIFTH: The demised premises will, at the time possession thereof is delivered to the Tenant, comply with
all laws, ordinances, orders, rules, regulations and requirements of all federal, state, county, and municipal
governments, departments, commissions, boards and officers, which may be applicable to the demised
premises and to the sidewalks, alleyways, passageways, curbs and vaults adjoining the same or to the use or
manner of use of the demised premises or the owners, tenants or occupants thereof. The obligations of the
Landlord under this paragraph shall survive the Tenant’s acceptance of the demised premises.

SIXTH: Landlord shall deliver the premises, including every part of the structure thereof and all fixtures,
equipment, and appurtenances therein, in a safe, dry, clean, and tenantable condition and in good and safe
order and repair and shall, at his expense, in order to maintain the same in such condition, make all necessary
repairs, replacements, improvements, and alterations.

SEVENTH: The tenant shall take good care of the demised premises and fixtures and equipment therein
and shall make, as and when needed, as a result op misuse or neglect by the Tenant, all repairs in and about
the demised premises necessary to preserve them in good order and condition, which repairs shall be equal in
quality and class to the original work. However, the Landlord may repair, at the expense of the Tenant, all
damage or injury to the demised premises, or to the building of which the same form a part, or to its fixtures or
equipment, done by the Tenant or the Tenant’s servants, employees, agents, visitors or licensees, or caused by
moving property of the Tenant in or out of the building, due to carelessness, negligence, or improper conduct
of the Tenant, or the Tenant’s servants, employees, agents, visitors or licensees. If the necessity for a repair is

occasioned by fire or some other cause which is include: in insurance maintained by or on behalf of the |

Landlord, the Tenant shall not be called upon fully to pay for this repair, whether or not the reapir is included
among those which the Tenant has covenanted to make. The Landlord shall make the repair in question and
credit the Tenant, after completing such work, with the net proceeds of insurance. . )

EIGHTH: If the Tenant notifies the Landlord of any condition which the Landlord has an obligation to rectify
under this lease, upon the failure of the Landlord within 20 days to rectify the condition, the Tenant may cause
all repairs, replacements, maintenance, alterations, or improvements necessary to rectify the condition to be
made or done himself and may deduct his costs for such work from any installment or installments of rent that
may be due or that may become due. Notice shall conclusively be deemed served upon the Landlord if in
writing and perssonally delivered to the Landlord or sent by registered or certified mail addressed to the
Landlord at the place above designated for the payment of rent.

NINTH: Tenant’s obligations to pay rent shall cease in the event of fire, flood, or the appearance of an defect
in or occurrence of any failure of any part, structure, or fixture of or the interruption of any essential service to
the demised premises, not wrongfully caused by the Tenant, which renders the premises untenantable.

TENTH: The Tenant shall comply with: all laws, ordinances and governmental regulations applicable to the

premises and shall not do or permit to be done in the demised premises anything which shall increase the rate
of fire insurance on the building. If, as a result of a breach of this covenant, the fire rates are increased, the ad-

ditional premium shall be considered additional rent and be paid with the next installment of rent.

ELEVENTH: The Tenant shall conform to the rules and regulations attached hereto and made a part hereof
and shall conform to such other and further reasonable rules and regulations as the Landlord may from time
to time adopt. The Landlord shall not be liable for the breach of the said rules and regulations by any other
Tenants.

TWELFTH: The Landlord shall be liable for compliance with any order or request by any municipal, coun-
ty, state, or deferal official based on any public housing or building code, law, ordinance, rule, regulation, or
requirement.

This lease was prepared by
Bob Shurack, a thirdyear law
student at Washington and Lee
University and legal research
assistant for the Ring-tum Phi.

Of concern to lawyers only,
this provision ensures that a
court construing the lease will
interpret the covenants of the
parties that they shall do
something as meaning that they

must do that thing, and not
merely that they propose to do
it, or that they ought to doit.

This provision effectively in-
corporates into the lease the
Lexington city housing code.

Thus, the landlord who enters
into this lease owes a personal
duty to the tenant to comply
with the city code, and not
merely a duty to the city.

This, in effect, enables the te-
nant to privately enforce the ci-
ty code. He need not rely on the
city inspectors; rather, he can
himself take the landlord to
court if he violates any provi-
sion of the code.

_ This provision creates the

. basic duty of the landlord to

deliver the property in good
condition and to make repairs
as needed to keep it that way.

The precise wording is impor-
tant because every contingency
must be provided for.

For example, ‘repairs’ does
not include work which in-
creases the life of the building.
Thus, the replacing of a roof is
not a repair. Nor is a new fur-
nace or new electrical wiring.

This provision provides that
the tenant must take good care
of the property and must repair
any damages that he causes by
his fault.

This gives the tenant the all-
important right to make needed
repairs himself and deduct the
cost from the rent payments, if
the landlord refuses to make the

repairs.

This requires the tenant to
abide by the city housing code.
Under the code, the tenant must
do such things as keep the plum-
bing fixtures he uses clean and
Sanitary and properly dispose
of his garbage.

THIRTEENTH: If the demised premises or any part thereof shall be condemned for public use, this lease is
to be thereupon terminated and the rent shall be apportioned as of the day of the entry of the order of condem-
nation and the Tenant shall not be entitled to any part of the award in condemnation, and the Tenant hereby

waives any right or claim therein.

SEVENTEENTH: The Landlord reserves the right to possession and control of the demised premises for the
sole purpose of and only to the extent required for compliance with his covenants under this lease. Landlord
shall notify the Tenant of the specific dates and times of day when Landlord intends to exercise this right, at

this right unreasonably or in a manner that causes unnecessary annoyance or inconvenience to the Tenant.

EIGHTEENTH: Except as required to comly with his covenants in this lease, the Landlord shall not, within
the term of this lease, remove anything from or replace anything within, or otherwise alter in any way the
demised premises, its tixtures, equipment, or appurtenances, unless it be with the express written consent of
the Tenant.

NINETEENTH: The Tenant deposits hereby with the Landlord the sum of $ as security for the full and
faithful performance by the Tenant of all the terms and conditions of this lease, which sum shall be returned to
the Tenant at the expiration of the term provided the Tenan! has fully and faithf-lly performed all the terms
and conditions on his part to be performed. If the Landlord willfully fails to return any security required to be
paid to the Tenant, the Tenant may recover such security due him together with reasonable attorney’s fees. In
the event of a bona fide sale of the premises, subject to this lease, the Landlord shall have the right to transfer
the deposit made by the Tenant to the vendee for the benefit of the Tenant.

SUGGESTED RULES AND REGULATIONS

1. The sidewalk, entrance, hall, passages, stairway or fire escapes shall not be obstructed by the tenants or
used by them for.any other purposes than those of ingress to and egress from their apartments.

2. No signs, advertisements or notices shall be painted or affixed upon any part of the building, outside, nor
shall any article be suspended outside the building.

3. No noisy or disorderly conduct or any conduct annoying or disturbing to the occupants of the building in-
cluding the playing of a musical instrument, or the operation of a television set, radio, or phonograph shall be
permitted in the demised premises between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and the following 8:00 a.m.

4. No animal or bird of any kind shall be taken into or kept in or about the premises without the consent of the
Landlord in writing.

5. The halls of the building shall not be used as a playground for children and no bicycle or baby carriage will
be allowed therein.

6. Nothing shall be hung by the Tenant from or placed on the windows, terraces, balconies, fire escapes or
window sills. Nor shall any mops, towels, rugs, etc., be hung or shaken from any window or door.

7. All garbage and refuse shall be disposed of in such manner as Landlord shall designate.

8. The Landlord may retain a passkey to all premises. No local shall be changed without the prior written
consent of the Landlord and a duplicate key delivered to the Landlord.

9. The Landlord reserves the right to make such additional rules from time t0 to time as shall in the opinion
of the Landlord be necessary.

If the state decides to build a
highway through the house the
tenant is living in, the lease will
terminate and the tenant will
get back any prepaid rent that
is applicable to that part of the
term of the lease over which he
will not be able to live in the
house .

If the landlord controls the
furnace and water heater, then
he must supply heat and hot
water in adequate amounts.

But where there are separate
space heaters and hot water
heaters in the tenant’s rooms,
then that equipment must be
capable of supplying adequate
heat and hot water.

Because the landlord has
rather extensive duties to
repair defects and to maintain
the premises, he must be given
a right to possession and control
so that he may carry out his
obligations.

Otherwise, a court might say
that the landlord’s duty to
repair and maintain and unen-
forceable by the tenant. But the
landlord should not be able to
enter the premises at
unreasonable times (i.e. 3 a.m.)
and should give notice to the te-
nant that he intends to enter.

This gives the tenant a right
to recover attorney’s fees if his
landlord wrongfully refuses to
return the security deposit.

This is important because,
without this right, it would nor-
mally cost more to sue the
landlord to recover the deposit
than the amount of the deposit

itself.

This provision ensures that if
the landlord dies, becomes
disabled, senile, or insane, of if
he sells the property, the lease

_ will still be good and the tenant

cannot be forced to leave the
premises.

This means that if one party
does not perform anything in
the lease that he has promised
to perform, the other party need
not perform his obligations in
the lease.

But the failure to perform
must be of a material nature,
and not minor, inconsequential,
or trivial.

For example, if the
landlord does not fix a furnace
when it breaks down, and the
building becomes very cold, the
tenant need not pay the rent un-
til the furnace is fixed. This is
an extreme measure and should
only be resorted to when it ap-
pears very clear that the
landlord is breaching his
material covenants and he can-
not be moved to take the action
that he ought to.

 

This sample lease is recom
mended to student tenants as an
example of a fair and evenhand-
ed document, ensuring many te-
nant rights not normally found
in leases nor covered by].
Virginia law. The student is
cautioned, however, about any
changes that might effectively
eliminate those rights setforth

 

herein.

LEASE

 

(continued from page S-5)
more than twice the monthly rent.

The landlord must, within five days after
the tenant begins to occupy the premises,
give the tenant a written report itemizing
all damages which then exist.

If the tenant does not object to the
report, in writing, within five days after he
receives it, the damage report will be con-
sidered to be correct.

This revort will be the basis for deter-
mining what damage the tenant has caus-
ed during his occupancy of the premises.

If, at the expiration of the lease, the
landlord keeps any part of the security
deposit because of damages for which he
claims the tenant is responsible, the
landlord must give the tenant a written
notice itemizing the damages and their
amount within 45 days after the termina-
tion of the lease and delivery of possession
of the premises to the landlord.

The tenant has a right to be present
when the landlord makes his inspection to
assess damages. To exercise this right, the
tenant must notify the landlord in writing
that he wishes to be present at the inspec-
tion; if the tenant does so, the inspection
must be made within 72 hours after the te-
nant vacates the premises, and the tenant
is entitled to an itemized list of damages as
soon as the inspection is completed.

If the landlord holds the secuirty for
more than 13 months from the date the
lease was made, the landlord must, when
he returns the security to the tenant, in-
clude interest figured at the rate of three
per cent per year, compounded semi- an-
nually.

In the words of the law, the landlord
must ‘‘make all repairs and do whatever is
necessary to put and keep the premises in
a fit and habitable condition.”’

He must “maintain in good and safe
working order and condition all electrical,
plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating,
air conditioning and other facilities and
appliances” that he supplies.

The landlord must supply both hot and
cold running water and ‘“‘reasonable”’ heat
in season unless the tenant has exclusive
control of the heating and water heating
equipment.

The tenant has the duty to exercise due
care in the use of the premises.

Basically, he must keep the area he con-
trols, including all plumbing fixtures,
clean and safe, he must remove garbage
properly, he must abide by the reasonable
rules and regulations of the landlord, and
he must not disturb his neighbors.

Also, he must permit the landlord to
enter the premises for purposes of inspec-
tion and to make repairs, but the landlord
must give notice beforehand and he may
enter only at reasonable times.

If the landlord does not live up to any of
his material obligations in the lease, or
does not comply with the provisions of the

 

law in a way that “materially affects
health or safety,”’ the tenant may give
written notice to the landlord that the lease
will terminate after 30 days if the landlord
does not remedy the defect within 21 days.

But the tenant may not terminate the
lease if he, himself, deliberately or
careflessly caused the conditon complain-
ed of.

Except for the right of the tenant to ter-
minate the lease if the building is
destroyed or severely damaged by fire,
this is the only tenant’s remedy that does
not require the tenant to go to court. If the
tenant invokes this remedy of termination
of the lease, he must move out when the
lease is terminated.

But if the tenant desires to stay, there
are several ways he can force the landlord
to make the necessary repairs or te pro-
vide the required services.

And the tenant may obtain a reduction in
his rent or, in an extreme case, it may
even by forgiven entirely, to reflect the
decreased rental value of the premises.

Also, the tenant has the right to recover
damages from the landlord.

Unfortunately, however, these remedies
require the tenant to go to court; and
unless he is unsually able, he will require
the services of a lawyer. But the tenant

. May recover from the landlord a
} reasonable attorney’s fee if he does take
> the landlord to court and wins.

Since the tenant ordinarily would re-
quire legal assistance to enforce his rights
under the law, not further discussion is in-
cluded here. The tenant should, however,
as soon as he discovers a condition that is
the landlord’s duty to rectify, send the
landlord a letter by certified mail notifying
him of the condition.

This is necessary to preserve the te-

\ nant’s rights under the law and is especial-
ly necessary to prevent the landlord from

 

 

evicting the tenant who does not pay his
rent because of the poor condition of the
premises.

In such a case, if the landlord sues the te-
nant to recover possession of the property,
the tenant, if he has previously sent the re-
quired notice to the landlord, will be able
to defeat the landlord’s action.

The Virginia Residential Landlord and
Tenant Act also obligates the landlord to
comply with local housing codes.

If the landlord does not comply with the
requirements of the local code, the tenant
has the same remedies against the
landlord as he has for breach of lease
covenants and for noncompliance with the
other enumerated provisions of the state
law.

The Lexington city housing code re-
quires the landlord to supply adequate hot
and cold running water to all sinks,
showers, and bathtubs.

The hot water must be heated to at least
120 degrees F

The landlord must either supply the hot
water directly, or he must equip the
premises with the necessary equipment to
supply the required hot water.

The landlord must supply heating
facilities which are properly installed and
maintained in safe and good working order
and which are capable of heating at least
one-half of all habitable rooms to at least
70 degrees F’.

If the landlord controls the heat directly,
he must heat at least one-half of all
habitable rooms to at least 70 degrees F’.

Every habitable room must have at least
one electrical outlet.

The kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms,
laundry room, furnace room, corridors,
hallways, and porches must have at least

 

one ceiling or wall-type light fixture, which
must be maintained in good and safe work-
ing order.

Common hallways and stairways in
apartment buildings containing five or
more apartments must be adequately
lighted at all times.

In apartment buildings containing four
or fewer apartments, such areas must be
provided with conveniently located light
switches controlling an adequate lighting
system, which may be turned on and off as
needed.

The landlord must keep clean and
sanitary all common areas, but the tenant
is responsibile for keeping the areas that
he occupies clean and sanitary.

Also, the tenant is responsible for pro-
perly disposing of all garbage and rubbish,
which means placing it in adequate con-
tainers, presumably - with tight-fitting
covers.

The responsibility for extermination of
insects and rodents rests with the landlord
unless the leased premises are occupied as
one-family house, in which case it is the te-
nant’s or co-tenant’s responsibility

Apart from relying on the state law or
his lease to force the landlord to live up to
his obligations, the tenant may register
complaints with the city health inspector
that the landlord is violating the city hous-
ing code.

But it must be understood that although
the housing code imposes on the landlord
the duty to repair and maintain the
premises, he owes that obligation to the ci-
ty and not to the tenant.

In other words, the tenant cannot en-
force the code on his own. He can only re-
quest that it be enforced; it is up to the city
to deal with the landlord to achieve com-
pliance with the code.

And the landlord often can, by one
means or another, avoid compliance with
the requests and orders of the city inspec-
tor.

Sometimes The Lease May Be Stacked Against You

by Joe Scott

A careful reading of the lease and
close inspection of the premises you
intend to rent are necessary before
you sign on the dotted line.

Usually you will be presented with
a form lease and be given a casual
tour by the landlord. Ask questions
while you tour because the landlord
does not want to waste his time.

With student housing as scarce as
it is, a landlord’s position will be
“take it or leave it, there is always
somebody who needs a place to
live.”’

Translating a lease into plain,
readable English can often be dif-
ficult. Lease clauses are sometimes
printed in no logical order and im-
portant items are buried deep within
a paragraph. You must read the en-
tire document and be aware of what
you are getting into before you sign.

Striking a phrase or clause in the
lease is legal if you and your
landlord agree. The best procedure
would be to cross out the part in
question and have it initialled by you
and your landlord on all copies of the
lease that you will sign.

If you have already signed the
lease without making these ad-
justments, you can still negotiate the
changes but there are no guarantees
that you will succeed.

As a last resort you can take your
case to court.

Lower courts which deal with
these dipsutes usually regard leases
as the final word which puts the

 leasee at a disadvantage.

Legal proceedings are also time
consuming, expensive and regarded
as a nuisance.

When reading a lease, the reader
before signing should look for poten-
tial problems or ‘‘danger spots.”

The following clauses are major
points to look for. In many states
these clauses are illegal. However,

_the official language in a lease
discourages many tenants from ex-
ercising their legal rights if the
clauses are present. Be aware of the
protections you have.

1. The landlord is not liable for

repairs.

An example:

“This lease and the obligation of te-
nant to pay rent hereunder...shall in
nowise be affected, impaired or excus-
ed because landlord is unable to supp-
ly or is delayed in supplying any ser-
vices or repairs, additions, alterations
or decorations.”

This clause is one example of an
“independent covenant’’ still ap-
plicable in renting. It states that the
tenant’s rent obligations is separate
from the landlord’s obligation to pro-
vide a “‘habitable dwelling.”

Technically, it forbids a tenant to
withhold rent if the landlord does not
fulfill his promises. It backs the te-
nant into a corner by making him
sue or bring legal action against the
landlord. This process is long and
cumbersome.

2. You agree to obey all rules,
whether written yet or not.

“The tenant further agrees to pay all
costs, including legals fees and other
charges that may accure in the event
distraint proceedings are instituted
against the tenant, or in the event suit
for rent or dispossess proceedings are
necessary in order to obtain possession
of the premises, or to collect the rent.”

Rules such as pet and noise
restrictions are common but if any
restrictions are violated it can pro-

 

vde a landlord with an excuse to
evict you or withhold the tenant’s
security deposit. Know all restric-
tions and insist on reading them.
Some leases forbid driving nails into
the walls, for example.

If it is necessary to agree to future
rules, the lease should provide an
“arbitration procedure’ to voice
possible tenant complaints if you
find yourself violating new rules.

3. Agreeing to pay more rent.

“Tenant agrees, during the term of
his lease or any renewal thereof that in
the event there shall be an increase in
real-estate taxes, sewer or water
charges during the year ----, or an
assessment charged by the municipali-
ty on the demised premises for any
period following the date of com-
mencement of this lease, tenant shall
pay his proportionate share of said tax
increase, charge or municipal assess-
ment.”

These clauses enable a landlord to
raise the rent if operating expenses,
such as taxes, increase. Leases over
one year usually contain an
automatic rent increase for each
year whether specified-by amount or
percentage. Understanding this rule
can Save money.

4. Landlord access to your home at
any time.

“Landlord or landlord's agents shall
have the right to enter the demised
premises during reasonable hours, to
examine the same, and to show them to
prospective purchasers, lessees, mor-
tgagees or insurance carriers of the
building, and to make such repairs,
alterations, improvements or additions
as Landlord may deem necessary or
desirable. If tenant shall not be per-
sonally present to open and permit an
entry into said premises, at any time,

when for any reason an entry therein
shall be necessary or permissible
hereunder, Landlord or Landlord’s
agents may enter the same, without
rendering Landlord or Landlord’s
agents liable therefore.”

Leases usually vary with respect
to this clause. This example literally
allows your landlord to break into
your apartment when you are not
there and show the house or apart-
ment to a “‘prospective purchaser.”’
Some courts have modified this
clause and have usually restricted
visiting hours to regular business
hours and require a 24-hour notice
unless there is an emergency.
Courts have also determined that
this right of access cannot be used as
tenant harassment. Proving that
harassment exists usually requires
a court case.

5. Landlord liability in the event of
injury or property damage.

Hazard lists are included in most
leases and state that the landlord is
not liable under those conditions.
Usually the list includes “falling
plaster, steam, gas, electricity, water,
rain or snow which may leak from any
part of said building.”

Form leases contain a sjmilar list
but state that the landlord is respon-
sible if "he or she have been
negligent.”

Leases claiming that the landlord
is not liable even if through his own
negligence are hazards themselves.
Some leases state “that the lessor
shall not be liable for any damage or
injury of the lessee” but do not usual-
ly hold up in court.

If damage occurs to personal pro-
perty, collecting compensation will
in most instances require a court
case.

6. All improvements are property of
the landlord.

“The lessee agrees that no altera-
tions, additions or improvements shall
be made in or to the premises without
the consent of the lessor in writing,
under penalty of damages and
forfeiture, and all additions and im-
provements shall be made by the Te-
nant shall belong to the lessor.”

Most leases require landlord con-
sent before alterations are made.
Once improvements are completed
they belong to the landlord, thereby
enhancing the rental value.

These clauses are intended to’
refer to items that if removed would
damage the premises. Even if
removal would not cause damage,
the Jamdlord still has the right to for-
bid their removal.

7. Adsepting the premises as they

   
   
   
   
   

fessee accepts said premises in
sent conditions.” This clause
usually reinforced by
. "Neither party has made any
Jation or promises, except as
herein, or in some further
ed by the party.”

_you sign, make sure that
ars promised are in writing.
mp avoid future problems.

 

# - Different
_ Types of
- Housing

by Bob Willis

Types of rental housing vary
widely. Although the classifica-
tions are loosely defined, hous-
ing types can be subdivided into
apartments, attached houses
and detached houses.

Each form of housing offers
different features and probably
one rental type appeals best to
your individual lifestyle.

An apartment provides you
with the most service and the
least responsibility. Someone
else takes care of the heating,
yardwork, maintenance, and
redecorating. Also, some if not
all, of the utilities may be in-
cluded in the rent payment.

An attached house,
townhouse or duplex differs
from an apartment in basically
two ways. You usually have a
yard and you assume some
responsibilities for the place’s
operation.

The care of the lawn, the
heating, and general repairs
might rest upon your shoulders.
The utilities may or may not be
included in the rent.

A detached house is often
characterized by more home
space, a larger yard and
perhaps a garage. ;

A separate house has more
privacy than in either of the
other housing categories.
However, you assume respon-
sibility for the upkeep of the
home.

You pay for the orcinary ex-
penses involved in running a
home, such as utilities, lawn
maintenance, and snow
removal, in addition to your
rent.

Some Notes On The Housing Situation

Contrary to popular belief, some
students do not live in dilapidated
houses in the country by choice.
More than a few were forced to live
outside of town because they did not
know that to find housing for
September, you have to start looking
seven months before that.

Some landlords in town survive
very well by relying on word-of-
mouth to advertise the availability
of their apartments. But what if you
are not one of the lucky students who
just happens to be connected to the
housing pipelinev

Even now, in the middle of
February, the great student housing
race in Lexington has been rolling
for a few months now, although it is
just about to begin in earnest.

The winners will take the housing
they desire with their knowledge and
experience of the housing race. The
losers will have to take what they
can get, and be satisfied with it.
Housing in town for students is ex-
panding, but not fast enough to
become truly competitive. Few
landlords will have an empty house
or apartment because no student
was willing to pay their exhorbitant
rental rates.

After a broad investigation of the
student housing situation in Lex-
ington, we must conclude that
Washington ard Lee students are at
a severe disadvantage in this town.
Often they do not know their rights
as tenants. Students also pay the
highest rental rates in the area.
Well, after all, they can usually af-
ford it. But they should at least be
getting their money’s worth.

This special section of the Ring-
tum Phiis an attempt to provide
some of the.information necessary

to give students a fighting chance in
Lexington’s student housing game.
The stakes are high. A lot of money
is involved in student housing, which
can be a very profitable business. It
seems only fair that if students can-
not be on an equal footing with their
landlords legally, they should at
least be aware of the problems and
pitfalls in rental housing.

We have also examined the ser-
vices this University provides
students looking for housing and
found them lacking, very lacking.
But there is hope. All the University
officials we spoke with were en-
couraging and anxious to do more to
help students in their search for ade-
quate off-campus housing. ~

The students who require off-
campus housing are no small group.
In fact, they comprise over a majori-
ty of Washington and Lee’s student
body. At most, the University can
house 691 students (including
freshmen), if all dormatories and
double rooms are filled. But there
are 1,742 students at W&L (including
law students), which means that
over 1,000 students must fend for
themselves in finding a place to live
each year. Fraternities reduce that
number somewhat, to be sure. But
by our estimates, 55-60 percent of the
student body must scramble to ar-
range housing for the next academic
year.

Our concern lies primarily with
those freshmen and sophomores who
are not experienced enough in Lex-
ington’s student housing game to
know that one has to look for next
September’s housing right now. We
are also concerned about the
students who are not who are not
lucky enough to know an_ up-

 

 

perclassman who can pass his house
down to them. There are too many
other things to worry about in col-
lege without having to be concerned
with locating next year’s living
quarters seven months ahead of
time.

can to help students with leases,
utilities, and information about their
rights and obligations as tenants.
What is need now is for a list to be
compiled of housing for students in
Lexington and Rockbridge County.
Hopefully, progress will be made in
that direction in the near future.

Until then, though, present tenants
should warn those who will inherit
their housing next year of the pro-
blems that they encountered with
that house or apartment so that the
students down the line, at least, can
have a chance to upgrade their liv-
ing conditions.

If students insist that their rights
be guaranteed and that repairs be
made before they sign their lease,
then, maybe, we will all get a better
housing deal in this town.

Enforcing Housing Standards

by Joe Scott

Health Inspector Charles Wisecarver en-
forces the miminum housing standards or-
dinance for Lexington and handles tenant
complaints for substandard living conditions.

Previously, enforcement of the ordinance
was the responsibility of Lexington’s building
inspector, but on Oct. 1, 1977, the city council
gave the job to the local health department.
Wisecarver stated that at the time there was
a ‘considerable backlog of cases.”’

‘“‘My primary duty is to the county,” said
Wisecarver. ‘‘I have to work on local housing
when I have time. We have worked off most of
the complaints.”’

The Procedure

The procedure for registering a housing
complaint starts with a phone call to the
health department. If the tenant feels there
are violations of the housing code, then a visit
from Wisecarver is the next stop.

A list of all complaints and possible viola-
tions should be written by the tenant before
the health inspector arrives. Details of each
individual problem are helpful.

Examples of the problems such as roaches,
which emerge mainly at night, are critical in
order to confirm all violations.

Using the minimum housing standards or-
dinance as a guide, the inspector tours the
house and records all violations that he finds.

of the property.

Next a 30-day notice is given to the landlord
which requires him to correct all violations
within the given time span.

Landlord Failure

If, for some reason, the landlord or proper-
ty owner fails to correct the violations within
30 days, then a second and final notice of 60
days is issued by the inspector.

Failure to comply with this notice can lead
to a warrant for the arrest of the property
owner.

Special cases such as a landlord’s inability
to correct the problem immediately are left
up to the discretion of the health inspector.

Wisecarver states that a ‘reasonable
amount of time’”’ is then allowed for the pro-
blem to be corrected. This procedure though
is the exception and not the rule.

Out-of-State Landlords

Problems can arise if the property owner
does not live in the state.

The tenant can still complain about the
housing violations, have the house inspected
and, if violations are found, have his com-
plaint formally registered by the health in-
spector.

The health inspector can then issue the 30-
day and 60-day notices. Unfortunately if the
landlord fails to correct the housing viola-
tions, court action becomes difficult.

Wisecarver Discusses His Job As

Lexington’s Housing Watchdog

by Joe Scott

Charles Wisecarver’s job as
health inspector is a com-
plicated task.

Not only must be deal with
written standards applied to
specific cases, but he also must
deal with he people who live in
the dwellings and its owner.

Interpreting what is ‘“‘a
reasonable amount of time”
necessary for the landlord to
make repairs is difficult.

Bringing all housing up to
standards is, in his words,
doubtful.

The job is endless, ‘‘due to
continuous deterioration’ of
housing, he adds. “‘I wish I had
more time but my primary duty
is to the county.”

“I have to deal with the cold

hard facts,” says Wisecarver.

“If there are housing code
violations, I have to report them
and issue a notice.’ He adds
that “‘my concern and duty is to
bring housing up to standard.”

“In most cases, we can work
out something,’’ states
Wisecarver, referring to times
the landlord has to fix code
violations, ‘“‘but if he fails to
repair the dwelling by the ex-
piration of the final 60-day
notice, then I can have a war-
rant served on him. Then we'll
let the judge decide.”

aa reasonable,’’
Wisecarver adds. ‘“‘If the

landlord can show me he is do-

ing everything he can, then I

will abide by his word.”’
Landlords who fail to repair

 

their houses can only have their
house condemned as a last
resort.

If the house is declared
uninhabitable, then all tenants
must leave. The house then can
be torn down.

The law though makes no pro-
visions for the former tenants.
They must fend for themselves.

“We have no control over
landlord eviction of tenants,”
says Wisecarver. ‘‘We are not
at this time forcing any person
to leave their home, though.”’

Court action against the
landlord is “generally light.’’
There are no maximum
penalties unless there are
repeated violations.

“Last year I was feeling my
way around,’’ stated
Wisecarver. ‘‘I will say, though,
that enforcement will be much
more rigid than it has been in
the past. I will put emphasis on
the vacant housing.”’

“In a town the size of Lex-
ington, I doubt if I can get all
the houses up to standard. As
long as you have certain
tenants, you are going to have
to continually bring the housing
up to standard,” he added.

“‘T see in the next five years
several new government sub-

. sidized low income housing pro-

jects going up around town,’:
Wisecarver said. ‘Until then,
we’ll just have to wait and see
what happens.”’

Unfortunately there is cur-
rently a waiting list of at least
one year for low income housing
in Lexington.

Students Who Took Their
Landlord to Court and Won

by Mike Perry

To many students, the idea of
taking your landlord to court
may seem like a drastic means
of resolving tenant-landlord
disputes, but four Washington
and Lee students found that the
legal process provided a swift
solution to their housing pro-
blems.

Last February, Grant
Leister, Holcombe Baird,
Walton Clark and Parker Potter
obtained a lease from their
landlord, Mrs. Gilbert L.
Brown, to rent the four bedroom
house on McCorkle Drive where
they currently live.

When Leister, who lived in the
house last year, insisted upon
repair of the front door,
refrigerator, and back porch
before signing the lease, he
received a verbal assurance
from the landlord that the
repairs would be made.

Repairs Not Done

Upon their return to Lex-
ington in September, the four
realized that the landlord had
made some repairs, but had
neglected the refrigerator, back
porch, and front door. Leister
says the landlord answered
their complaints with
assurances that ‘she would get
them done as soon as she
could.”’

The four then heard of a
group of W&L students who
were withholding rent from
their landlord until certain
repairs were made.

With no intention of going to
court, the four students sent
Mrs. Brown a letter informing

her that they would withhold

their monthly rent until the pro-
mised repairs were completed.

When the four returned
following Thanksgiving break
they learned that their student
neighbors had been evicted for
nonpayment of rent. Leister
states that the four decided to
go to court ‘‘to protect ourselves
from eviction.” q

What the Law Provides

Grant Leister went to the
Legal Aid Society at the Law
School, studied the Virginia
Residential Landlord and Tenant
Act and “‘determined “that we
had legitimate complaints
under the law.”

Anyone contemplating any
legal action against a landlord
should study the law very
carefully because it contains
ten situations in which
landlords are exempt from the
law. These exemptions include
occupancy by a fraternity and
occupancy in single family
residences where the owners do
not own more than ten single-
family residences subject to a
rental agreement.

Leister also points out that
the legal process is complicated
and it took them three attempts
“to correctly file the papers.”

On Dec. 1, 1978, the four filed
for an “escrow account,”’
whereby, as Holcombe Baird
explains, ‘trent money is paid to
the court and withheld from the
landlord until repairs are com-
pleted.”

They filed the required
documents and their landlord,
Mrs. Brown, was served with
papers requiring her to answer
the charges in court.

In Court

The case came to court on
Dec. 13, 1978 as Leister argued
the case for the four students.
Mrs. Brown retained a local
lawyer.

Leister argued that the
landlord ‘doesn’t do proper
maintenance,’ while -Mrs.
Brown’s lawyer maintained
that the repairs in question
were cosmetic in nature related
the problems faced by a
landlord when she rents to
students.

Leister says that the judge
remarked that Mrs. Brown
should be made to act respon-
sibly with her dealings with ren-
tors and decided to hold $50 of
the rent money while he resolv-
ed a technical point determin-
ing whether or not Mrs. Brown
was exempt from the law.

The students found to judge to
be an asset. As Walton Clark
reflects, ‘‘He asked some really
good questions of her on our
behalf.”’ :

New Lease

Clark thinks that relations
with their landlord are good at
present, but adds that she has
stated that will have an appen-
dage attached to all her leases
releasing her from liability for
repairs ‘‘as a result of our tak-
ing her to court.”’

Clark recommends that any
potential rentor “‘have any pro-
mised repairs attached to the
lease.”

The students also recommend
that anyone contemplating
legal action against a landlord
carefully examine the Virginia
Residential Tenant and Landlord
Act.

 

 

MOHLER

out rooms at the Robert E. Lee
Hotel to house freshmen?

Mohler: That’s hard to deter-
mine. It just doesn’t work quite
that easily.

They were to come in on
target with freshmen this year.
But they didn’t. They came in at
the beginning some 40 over We
ultimately have 30 or 31 we’re
housing at the old Robert E. Lee
Hotel.

Now we don’t like that. In
fact, I would suspect we pay
rather heavily for that.

‘ But I can’t declare that
we’re going to set aside all of
Baker or Davis or another dorm
for those freshmen.

Q: If there is available
University housing, why pay
the money for the R. E. L.
Hotel?

Mohler: Well, I think you
have a good point. It’s a cir-
cumstantial thing. There are no
hard, fast rules for the way it
works.

We have double rooms in the
Lee Houses. It’s hard to sell an
upperclassman a_ double
room—believe me it is...

I frankly think it’s difficult for
any girl to find housing in Lex-
ington. We’ve been male for two

and a quarters centuries and |

these landladies are afraid of
the girls. They spell trouble for
them, they think, I guess, I
don’t know. So we try to provide
for them. I think it’s very dif-
ficult for them. :

In that we're participating in
an exchange program, it seems
to me that we have some obliga-
tion to them. It isn’t spelled out
anywhere, I believe. But I feel
an obligation to them.

I feel an obligation to every
student here. I hope people
understand that.

And we endeavor to be cordial
and help students when they
come’ and I think they’ll bear
that out.

Our secretaries get together
and kick around things and give
bits of information that they
know that isn’t listed.

That’s very informal, don’t
misunderstand me. I wouldn’t
say that’s the most polished
way of doing it. But we seem to
do it most anyway we can to
find a place for everyone.

I guess what I’m trying to tell
you is that many times we have
vacancies within our dor-
matories.

Q: What about legal services,
legal advice?

Mohler: Well, they (students)
come in frequently to me with
questions relating to that.

Q: What do you tell them?

Mohler: I have very little to
tell them. At this time, I’m not
in a position to help them.

I feel the University maybe
should help them. It would be
very difficult to offer help in
these areas.

At one time, I worked a little
harder on this, I guess,
endeavoring to help the student.
But it’s difficult for me to ar-
range and negotiate contracts
with a landlord. That’s between
the two of you. You want to see
the facilities and see if it suf-
fices for your needs. They want
to eyeball you and see what you
look like.

Q: How do you envision your
job, sir? Do you see yourself as
being mostly concerned with
University housing, and then
helping students find outside
housing as a sidelight.

Mohler: I’m concerned with
every aspect of my work here of
which student housing is a part.
I’m here to help.

 

- Utilities

If all utilities are not included in your monthly rent, you may
have to contact one or more of the following. With the crush that
comes before every school year, it would be wise to make ar-
rangements for utilities at least one week ahead of time.Water is pro-
bably the most important utility, followed by electricity, gas,

telephone and television hook-up.

Water:

Water hook-up happens only after a $25 deposit is made at the Ci-
ty Treasurer’s office in City Hall, 463-3140. They contact the Public

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

A question of honor

A very important question now lies before the
students, faculty, administration, and alumni of this
academic institution: Will the Washington and Lee
community allow a convicted felon to graduate and
hold a degree from this University?

Last week, the Ring-tum Phi published a story
detailing a Rockbridge County Circuit Court case in
which two 1978 W & L graduates and a current senior
were all sentenced to five-year jail terms (with four
and one half years suspended) after pleading guilty to
charges that they had sold marijuana to police under-
cover agents. The crime is a felony in the state of
Virginia and the prescribed punishments were duly
distributed by the court of law.

The W&L community must now pass judgment on
the senior involved. Is he a Washington and Lee
“sentleman’’ and was his conduct, found to be
criminal in society’s judgment, “‘honorable’’ in the
sense of W & L’s honor code?

The White Book summarizes the honor system in
the following statement: ‘“‘A Washington and Lee stu-
dent is to act honorably at all times; is to be trusted
and assumes the obligation to be trustworthy.”

We now ask the entire University community: Is
there a foundation for the honor system, supposedly
one of the pillars of this University’s integrity and
‘raison d'etre, if a person who has been convicted under
society’s laws is not also exorcised from the W&L
community? If a convicted felon is determined to be
an honorable person, what of the student who merely
cheats on one test? Indeed, is there any basis of honor
or trust in a community that accepts criminals? And
where does our definition of ‘‘honor’’ stop, where do
we draw the limit? Does it only cover those who are

unlucky enough to be caught by outside authorities?

We think it only fitting to close with another selec-
tion from the White Book:

It is important to understand that the system is com-
pletely student-administered and concerned solely
with those. offenses which are considered dishonorable
by the student generation involved.

What is to be this student generation’s definition of

‘“thonorable’’?

Editors respond to lacrosse controversy

Editor, Ring-tum Phi
Sir:

Iam amazed that the Executive Committee
voted to fund an NCAA Division I team for a
trip to Florida. I cannot believe that the
representatives are willing to set what can on-
ly be viewed as a most dangerous precedent.

The Basketball Generals are planning a trip
to Europe next year. Surely they are as entitl-
ed to student monies as the lacrosse team? If
not, what can you give Coach Canfield as a
viable reason for refusing him the money?
Remember the lacrosse team got $ 1000! !

A reprehensible precedent has been set. It
is not, in Law representative John Murphy’s
words, a “‘one-time thing.’’ Bill Tucker — can
we stop payment on a check for $1000? !?

ple of the widespread consternation
on campus after the EC’s precedent-
shattering grant of $1,000 to the
lacrosse team. Most of us are reluc-
tant to speak any ill words concern-
ing Coach Emmer’s champions —
one EC member probably summed
up the general consensus (unfair
though it may be ) when he called
lacrosse ‘‘the only real sport at
W&L.”’ And several students with
complaints suddenly became silent
when we suggested they write a let-
ter to the newspaper. “‘Sure I have
objections,” said one, “‘but how can
you cut down the lacrosse team?

It’s like calling for the anti-Christ
while sitting in St. Peter’s.’’

Nobody wants to be a heavy in this
affair. However (bet you knew that
word was due to appear soon), we
see problems even beyond the ques-
tion of precedent. Since the ‘‘de-
emphasis” of athletics in 1954, pur-
suits of the scholar have always
come first. This grant by the EC
seems to endorse replacement of the
“‘scholar-athlete”’ with a subsidized
“‘athlete-scholar.”’

Even more distressing is the un-

. fair position in which the lacrosse

team is being placed by both the
athletic department and the EC.
Funds were gained after a legion of
promises were made by the athletic
department — better performance
in the early season, as well as im-
proved chances in the NCAA tourna-
ment. Should these lofty goals be un-
fulfilled (for whatever reason), the
team will be forced to bear the
blame.

In short, the EC has spent half of
their remaining “‘EC funding” for a
project that will, at best, directly
benefit a small segment of the stu-
dent body...and one that could prove
fruitless, leading to still greater
resentment.

More on McCormick inconvenience

Forever quick to respond to student
displeasure, the W&L administration issued
the following statement — via the News Office
— concerning the obstruction of traffic
around the McCormick renovation project.

Hardly anyone has failed to notice, and
comment on, the fencing-off of most of the
area between the Co-op and Newcomb Hall.
This is necessary so that the contractor may
begin site preparation work on the McCor-
mick renovation project, including installa-
tion of a drainage system and underground
utility services, among other good and useful
things. The fact is that not one square inch
has been blocked off more than he absolutely
needs, however — which is (or will quickly
become) apparent even to the most casual of
our many critical observers.

The point is to allow the entire project to
proceed in the most efficient and economical
way. Every other possibility would either add
substantially to the cost of the project, or sub-
tract from the contractor’s capability of ac-
complishing the whole McCormick project as
quickly as everyone wishes, or both.

For the duration, Mr. Parsons suggests that
students and faculty who wish to get from the
dorms of the gym area onto the Front Campus
choose one or the other of the following alter-
natives:

1. Those who can read and write may wish
to cut through the Bookstore and go out the
Co- op door.

2. Others, including dullards and those who
believe the University’s purpose is to inflict
maximum inconvenience on them personally,
are invited to go between the dorm and the
Bookstore, by the dumpsters.

Swimmers now 2-6
after dunking VMI

by Ed Taylor

This past Saturday the W&L
swimming team split two meets
and now has a 2-6 win-loss
record for the season. Thanks to
some outstanding individual
performances, W&L defeated
VMI 75-39, but lost to Old Domi-
nion 62-50. With only one meet
left in the regular season, Coach
Bill Stearns is now ‘‘tapering”’
his swimmers for post-season
competition.

In Saturday’s meet Chip Hoke
won the 1000 free in 10:09.70,
placing him fourth in the nation
in Division III. Other winners
for W & L included diver Jay
Diesing who was victorious in
both the one and three meter
diving events against VMI and
ODU with scores of 225.85 and
199.65. Also, Keith Romich in
the 200 free (1:47.09), and Bob
Newcomb in the 100 free (49.80)
finished first in both meets. In
addition, the 400 free relay
team, consisting of Newcomb,
Hoke, Herb Gressons and Mike
Bernot, won in a time of 3:23.40.

Asked why the team is having
so much trouble this year when
last year they were one of the
best teams in Division III,
Coach Stearns pointed out that,
obviously, the losses of John
Hudson, a 17-time All-
American, and David Kent, a
holder of three state records,
certainly hurt this year’s squad.
However, Stearns also cited two
other interesting points. First,
before the swimming season
began, many of the swimmers
were on a successful water polo
team. In fact, one week before
the first swim meet, the water
polo team was at the Easterns
competing against some top
Division I teams. Second, many
of the schools that W&L swam
against this year were Division
I teams, which of course, give
scholarships. Therefore, the
won-lost record suffered but the
experience gained from the stiff
competition showed some pro-

Warner Center against VMI.

fit. As a result, the tough
schedule should pay off for the
swimmers in the up-coming
state and national meets.
This Saturday, the swimmers

Generals romp 84-67;
end up 7-3 in ODAC

by Bill Whalen
The Washington and Lee
Generals ended the 1978-79
home season last Tuesday night
with a convincing 84-67 win over
Eastern Mennonite at the
Warner Center. The Generals,
who now stand at 16-7 overall,
finished with a 10-5 home court
record and also finished with a
7-3 ODAC record, after an 0-3

start in the conference.
Tuesday night’s hero did not
play in the game, however. He

was inside Coach Verne Can-
field’s mind. The real secret to
the Generals’ lastest winning
streak (now at three games) is
Canfield’s arduous practices.
Following the 75-63 loss to
Randolph-Macon on Feb. 3, the
coach has “gone back to the
basic of defense.’’ And the
results have been devastating.
In the last three games, the
scores have been 89-53, 82-72
and Tuesday night’s 84-67.
Tuesday night’s game was a

Grapplers Take Four Meets;
Increase Record To 6-3

ing, the wrestling team now is
enjoying new-found success.

that pushed their dual meet
record to 6-3 and assured the
Generals of their fifth con-
secutive winning season under
Coach Gary Franke. Last
Wednesday the Generals
defeated ODAC member
Hampden-Sydney 36-14 and
Longwood College 42-10. Then
over the weekend the Generals
beat Davidson College on Fri-
day 36-20 and Catawba 33-17 on
Saturday.

The win against Sydney,
which kept the Generals
undefeated in ODAC, was never
really close. Ed Rogers’ 18-1
win at 158 secured the team vic-
tory. At the same time the
Generals were’ wrestling
Longwood and only two grap-
plers lost.

The match against Davidson
was the closest of the four and,
as Coach Franke explained, the
Generals got some ‘breaks.’

“A turning point came when the. .

guy wrestling Hank Wall (126)
was ina position to pin Hank but
instead pinned himself.” As

there were at Davidson, six:

wrestlers for the Generals won
at Catawba. Again Rogers was
the deciding win for the
Generals.

Three Generals were 4-0 last
week. Hank Wall (126), Mike
McFadden (150), and Rogers
(158) were the undefeated
wrestlers.

The last dua! meet for the
Generals was at home Wed.
Feb. 14 against James Madison.
The ODAC tournament is at
Lynchburg Feb. 20. From there
Coach Franke plans to bring
Ray Gross, Mike McFadden,
Ed Rogers, Dave Stoefell, Tom
Oxendine, and Dan Kniffen to
the NCAA Division III Qualify-
ing Tournament at Mansfield,
Pa. on Feb. 23-24.

-had received their

typical W&L game, reminis-
cient of the way the Generals
have played all year long. The
Generals could not get untrack-
ed in the first half as the took
early leads of no more than six
points. E-MC came back to tie
the score at 33, but W&L pulled
away toa 43-37 halftime lead.

In the second half, after they
usual
halftime chewing out, the
Generals played like a different
team. W&L put on a spurt of six
straight points to break open a
48-45 game into a 54-45 lead.
From this point, with Ardie Col-
lins and Tom _ Jeffries
dominating the defensive
boards with a combination of
blocked shots and rebounds, the
Generals pulled away to a lead
of 76-61. With Carby Hoy and
Dave Leunig hitting on long
jumpers, Jeffries and R.J.
Scaggs filling in the middle, and
Mike Wenke and Pete Farrell
handing out assists, E-MC
never stood a chance.

Still, Canfield was not totally
pleased with the performance.
“T’d like to get two good halves
out of these guys.” said the
coach. “‘In the first half we have

, » been using our pressure

defense, and by the second half
it wears the opponent down.
This was true against Eastern
Mennonite.”

Leading the Generals were
Hoy with 22 points while Farrell
and Jeffries each chipped in 12.
Leunig added 11.

The Generals ended up with a
7-3 ODAC mark and now can
finish no worse than third in the
conference. Two weekends
from now, on Friday night, Feb.
23, W&L will likely face Lyn-
chburg in an ODAC tournament
semifinal match. As usual, this
means that Lynchburg has been
making a big deal out of having
to play W&L. The Lynchburg
University newspaper has
already likened Coach Canfield
to Woody Hayes. But, as Can-
field reassures us — ‘‘consider-
ing the source of the material, it
doesn’t matter what is said.
They think we make a special
fuss over playing ,Lynchburg,
but it doesn’t matter that much
to us. If they want to say
anymore, they should look at
the record. Eight wins in the
last nine games is pretty con-
vincing.”’

Considering the way that
W&L has been playing, Lyn-
chburg might regret being too
boisterous. Maybe someone
should get Lynchburg in touch
with the Unknown Fans. If Lyn-
chburg has to face the Generals
in the Tournament, they will
need all the help they can get!

Tennis team faces ‘one of
toughest schedules ever’

by Nat Lovell

Though the Washington and
Lee tennis team has lost three
starting players, for various
reasons, and will be facing a
very tough schedule this spring,
first year Coach Gary Franke is
confident that the team will per-
form well.

The loss of last year’s All-
American Ben Johns will
especially hurt the team, but
this year’s group of freshmen
will undoubtedly help fill in the
gap. With returning junior All-
American and Captain Stewart
Jackson and léttermen David
Constine, Pat Norris (both
juniors) Doug Gaker and
Robert Shuler (both
sophomores), the team’s major
strength will be its depth. A pro-
bable lineup consists of Jackson
at number one_ singles,
freshman Shaw Cranfield at
number two singles, Gaker at
three, and a scramble for the
remaining three positions bet-
ween Shuler, Constine,
freshman Wes Yonge, and stan-
dout double player Pat Norris.

A wrestler at heart, Coach
Franke has applied his condi-
tioning expertise to the tennis
team and seems determined to
whip the players into top shape.
They will need all the stamina
they can build up for what
. Coach Franke calls “‘one of the
toughest schedules ever.’
Washington and -Lee annually
faces some of the sternest com-

by Warren Crowdus

As Washington and Lee’s
baseball squad enters its fourth
week of indoor practice ses-
sions, interim coach Chuck
Kroll (Coach Lyles is on sab-
batical) is optimistic about his
team’s chances this spring.
Kroll says the players have
forgotten about the Generals’
dismal performance in 1978 and
are looking forward to the new
season. ‘‘We are going to turn a
few heads around here and play
some good, aggressive
baseball,” said Kroll.

Kroll may have good reason
to be optimistic. Nearly all of
last year’s starter- including
co-captains Dan Kingman and
Rich Wiles, are back this year.
Other returnees are infielders
Mike Busbey, John Stagmaier
and Doug Hassinger, out-
fielders Don Swagart and
Chuck D’Auria, as well as the
ace of last season’s pitching
staff, Chip Chiles.

In addition to this nucleus of
veterans, Knoll has no less than
fifteen freshmen trying out for
the squad. Kroll hopes the
rookies will infuse a healthy at-
mosphere of competition into
the Generals’ training pro-

- gram. The Generals’ new coach
maintains that none of last
year’s regulars are guaranteed
of receiving a starting job. Be-
ing new to Washington and Lee,
Kroll will judge his players on

petition available for a Division
III school, including several
matches with Division I
powerhouses. The team’s Texas
trip features their toughest
games. The Generals will meet
the University of Texas, the
University of Dallas, and top-
ten Division I school Texas
Christian University. The
team’s success is not to be
measured by the number of vic-
tories over such schools as
these, for they will be decidedly
underdogged in these matches.
Instead, it is hoped that the

a

large amount of stiff competi-
tion will prepare them for the
ultimate year end goal of cap-
turing the Division HI National
Chamionships. Washington and
Lee has finished second in these
championships two years runn-
ing. W&L is also a member of
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference in tennis though mat-
‘ches between the Generals and
ODAC teams invariably have a
history of being romps in W&L’s
favor. The Generals have never
lost an ODAC match.

 

 

JMU’s fencers did not show up in Saturday’s match against W&L.
Here two General fencers play with each other.

Baseball team seeks
return to respectability

the basis of their performance
this spring, not by past records.

Kroll intends to do much of
his evaluating in Florida over
February break, when the team
will have a spring training
camp in the Orlando area. It is
difficult to judge players on the
basis of indoor performance.
Kroll feels he will have a much
better idea of who his best

players are after seeing the
team perform on the baseball
diamond. The trip to Florida
could also help the Generals get
a jump on their competition in
the early stages of the upcom-
ing season.

Coach Knoll says that one of
his team’s greatest challenges

Despite taking two first
places in last Saturday’s indoor
track meet at Lynchburg Col-
lege, Washington and Lee plac-
ed fourth out of five teams in the
final tally.

Lynchburg won the meet with
72 points followed by
Bridgewater-48, Davidson-58,
W&L-48, and Roanoke-28.

Instrumental in both first
place finishes was tri-captain
Jack Norberg who won the 440
yard run and was a member of
the winning mile relay team.
Other members of the relay
team were Ron Calkins, Randy
Austin and Dave Cordell.
Norberg also placed second in
the 60 yard dash.

Washington and Lee’s recent-

first match last weekend,
defeating the Roanoke Squash
Club 10-0.

‘This is no fly-by-night club,”
said club president Dee
Keesler, a junior, of the 48
member organization. ‘‘But we
really don’t have the facilities
to accomodate all those in-
dividuals.”

Keesler said the group is
planning a tournament with
squash clubs in Lynchburg and
Charlottesville. Two more mat-
ches for March have already
been planned with the Roanoke
club.

Keesler said his group is in-
terested in converting the two
handball courts in the gym, that
are not regulation size, into

The weak points proved to be
the distance runs, due to ‘‘inex-
perience and depth.”” However,
according to Aldridge, ‘‘there is
potential.” As expected the
strong points were the sprints
while the weight and jumping
events had performed better in
the past.

Others who performed well
were Russ Rector in the high
hurdles and high jump, Bob
Campbell who pole vaulted his
best height ever and Chris
Leiser who ran well in the 60
yarddash.

Coach Aldridge noted that
“Davidson hurt us more than
‘the other teams (did).”’ In look-
@ forward to the only other

ionships on February 24,

e added, “We have a

eel all events.”’

““nsufficient facilities for
and racketball at

The cost is a deterrent,
however, as the courts would

ost $7,500 each to panel with

weod and make usable for
squash and racketball.

“The money involved is
awesome ($15,000),’’ Keesler
said. ‘I think it’s kind of out of
our scope right now to raise that
much money.”

He said that he would be talk-
ing te the ‘‘proper administra-
tion officials’ in the future
about the possibility of funding
the remodeling project.

“‘We want to follow the same
route as the water polo team
and hopefully become an NCAA
sport,” Keesler said, ‘‘but
that’s not possible without the

proper facilities.’’

Mull purchases R.E. Lee

(continued from page 1)

The leases for the stores run
on a month to month system
with a six month notice before
termination. The beauty parlor
renewed its five year lease on
June 1, 1976.

Mull is a restaurant owner
who also rents apartments
above his College Inn. He has
big plans for his new property
on Main Street and has already
started to put his plan in action.

“It is something over the
years I’ve been looking at,”’
says Mull while running tbe
cash register in his restaurant.
‘Some tell you you are
bananas,”’ he adds, ‘‘and some
tell you of the positive aspects.
You get lots of encouragement
and discouragement. I don’t
know why someone has not
bought it yet,” remarks Mull.

“Some feel that the tremen-
dous financial outlay is too
much of a risk. It has complete-
ly turned them off,” he adds.
“I’m not wealthy by any stretch
of the imagination so I'll have to
work twice as hard. I personally
see a return on the investment
though.”’

“For now I don’t see any im-

mediate changes,’’ Mull says:
with regard to the hotel. ‘I plan
to fill it to capacity though and
will make every effort humanly
possible. I would like to start
signing leases immediately.’’

“T’ll be the first to admit that
I’m in it for the money,” says
Mull, ‘‘and I'll be at it for 10 to
20 years more.”’

“T can tell you though that I
see the rents going up at the
hotel,” finalizes Mull.

‘One thing I will state is that
there will be no restaurant in
the vacant store, that I can
assure you. There are too many
restaurants in town now,” said
Mull.

“T have talked to four or five
people who want to rent it but I
can’t divulge their names
because I don’t want to offend
any of them,” he adds. “The
back dining room and upstairs

ball room are still in the talking
stages.”

“IT have a lot of repairs to
make,’’ said Mull while boxing
a small cheese pizza to go. ‘‘The
structure itself is in good condi-
tion and it also has one of the
best fire ratings in town,’’ he
adds.

‘“‘Removing the restaurant
will get rid of one of the biggest
hazards because that is where
most of your fires start. Fire is
the overriding concern of the
landlord,” states Mull. “‘I have
always had a fear of it.”’

‘The problem will come from
the mechanical aspects, the
plumbing, heating and elec-
trical’’ Mull said. ‘‘That will
need attention and necessary
upkeep.”

“The elevators are in fine
shape and are inspected once a
month by the company who in-
stalled them. They are on im-
mediate call. If they get stuck
between floors we also have
keys to get the people out.

“Monday I’ll go through the
hotel and see what repairs have
to be made,’’ Mull said. “If any
hazards exist, I’ll get them cor-
rected immediately.”

“The parking lot will also
need attention,’ said Mull.
“There are a lot of potholes, and
lines have to be painted for a
parking system presently not
done. ‘

‘‘My first priority though is to
get those free parking signs
down,”’ said Mull. “I feel sure
I’ll charge for the parking.”’

Mull says that he hopes to
have the hotel in operation by
mid-August. “By that I mean
safe, clean, livable conditions. I
should be ready to go for the
79-80 school year,” he adds.
“T’ve shown four rooms
already.”’

“I have not met with the peo-
ple that are living there but I
will make a point to meet with
each one individually and tell
them that I am the new owner,”

said Mull.

“IT am a firm belkever that
everyone has different needs
and different situations.
Presently there are students
living in the hotel on two floors
and elderly people on another.”’

‘The leases are not yet deter-
mined but they will be pattern-
ed after the ones I currently use
at the College Inn,’’ Mull said.

“The leases I use now are 10
month leases. I think they are
the more workable leases,”’
adds Mull. “For students, it
gives them two weeks at the end
to get everything out. No matter
what your leases are though,
you are going to adjust them ac-
cordingly.”

“Costs are always going up,”’
he adds, ‘‘and if I knew how to
keep costs down, I’d be in
Washington D. C., not here,
solving the inflation problem.”

Tenants react to hotel sale

by Joe Scott

Elderly residents of the
Robert E. Lee Hotel are unsure
and worried about their futures.
Clyde Mull, new owner of the
hotel complex since Feb. 9, has
said there will be a rent in-
crease but has not specified the
amount.

Lucille Valentine has lived at
the hotel for 10 years and says
she “‘enjoys it very much.” She
lives on the sixth floor but would
rather not reveal her room
number because ‘‘there’s no
protection here. There is no one
at the front desk,’’ she says.
‘“‘We’ve never had any trouble
though with molesting or
anything.”’

“Mr. Mull has not talked to
me yet,’’ she says referring to
the rent increase. ‘“‘I wouldn’t
like it though because I’m on a
fixed income,’”’ she adds. “‘I
wouldn’t like it one bit.”’

“T like it here,’ says Mrs.
Valentine. “The boys (W&L
students who live on another
floor) are nice. When it last
snowed they offered to go shop-
ping for us.”’

“If the rent goes up, I couldn’t
stay here. I’d go to the poor
house,’’ Mrs. Valentine adds.
“My income isn’t going up
any.”

“I guess we’ll have to find a
place,” says Dorothy Wilson,
Lucille Valentine’s sister. ‘‘At
the moment I can’t think of any
place though,’”’ she adds. ‘“‘It
would have to be close by
because we can’t walk a lot. We
couldn’t afford a taxi.”’

“T like it here too,’’ says
Dorothy Wilson. “It’s a very
comfortable and convenient.”’

Mae Sue Donald has lived at
the hotel for over four years.
“I’ve enjoyed it. I’ve heard that
he is going to’’ she adds, referr-
ing to the rent increase.

“I don’t have anywhere else
to go. I could afford it, but I
need a job,’’ says Donald. ‘“‘I’d
try and find another place but I
hope it doesn’t come to that.’’

“Mr. Mull has not seen me,”’
Donald says, ‘‘I’ve seen him but
he hasn’t talked to me.”’

Still, Mr. Mull recently
assured members of the Ring-
tum Phi staff that he will make
every effort to co-operate with
the elderly residents currently
in the Robert E. Lee. ‘‘forcing
them out is certainly not in my
plans,” he said, and added, “‘I

intend to speak to them all as a
group in the near future. But
some adjustments must be

made, as these residents have
been paying rent figures which
haven’t kept up with the times
for many years.”’

Lack of Low Cost Housing

allowance if tenants are re-
quired to pay their own utility
bills. This would not put too
much of a burden on tenants
who live on welfare or other fix-
ed income. But there isn’t any
space available in any of the
rent-controlled complexes.

‘People have waited two years
or more to get an apartment in
the Mountain View Terrace
Housing Project, said J.B.
Lewis, one of the founders of the
Rockbridge Housing Corpora-
tion, which owns the apart-
ments.

People from anywhere within
Rockbridge County, including
Lexington and Buena Vista,
may apply for a one, two, or
three bedroom apartment
there, Lewis said. The lowest
rent for a one bedroom apart-
ment is $52.50, he said. The
apartment complex contains 40
units in all.

The waiting list at Willow Spr-
ings is not as long, but people
still wait up to a year to get an

apartment there, superinten-
dent Robert Moore said.

The rents are about the same
as in the Mountain View pro-
ject, but the turnover is greater
because Willow Springs has
more than 90 units, Moore said.
Willow Springs is designated as
middle income housing.

Lexington House Apart-
ments, the third rent-controlled
project, has a waiting list “at
least one-year long,’”’ manager
Shirley Leech said.

Lexington House is restricted
to senior citizens and disabled
people. A disabled person with a
family cannot live there, Leech
said.

The project has 78 one-
bedroom apartments, six of
which are designed with low
sinks, wide doors and other
features which make life easier
for disabled persons.

People who live in
Rockbridge County may apply
for a rental assistance pro-
gram, which is also sponsored

vacancy in one of these housing
projects. People who live in
rented houses, apartments or
trailers, which meet certain
standards can apply for the pro-
gram, which will pay a portion
of the rent, the program’s direc-
tor Don Johenning said.

In order to qualify for the ren-
tal assistance program the per-
son must meet specific income
guidelines and the place in
which he lives must have
heating and hot and cold runn-
ing water.

The program, which has been
in existence for about six mon-
ths, has helped 21 of 60 ap-
plicants, Johenning said. The
ones who were turned down
either did not meet income
guidelines or lived in  sub-
standard housing.

Residents of Lexington and
Buena Vista are not covered by
the rental assistance program,
he said, but if someone from one
of the cities applies for the pro-
gram he may receive aid after
he moves to the county.

EC Plans

Grade Review
Discussion
by David Greer

The Student Body Executive
Committee will meet Monday,
Feb. 26, to discuss final pro-
posals for the grade review
plan.

The EC hopes that students
will come to the meeting the
first Monday after Mid-Winter
break, and offer any sugges-
tions before the final draft is
sent to the faculty.

The meeting will be held at
6:30 p.m. in the EC room in the
student center.

In other business, the Student
Activities Board reported that it
lost $200 on their ski trip which
was cancelled. The money was
the initial deposit made for the
trip.

When asked about possible
bands for a spring concert the
SAB said that they were looking
into available bands and they
they had $500 on deposit with a
band agent in New York who
has moved and left no for-
warding address.

The Cold Check Committee
said that it hopes to pay off a
$500 loan from the EC next
month. It said that there is still
a little over $100 owed by
students who have left the
university.

Ring-tum Phi business
manager Cove Geary said that
the student newspaper is
operating in the black with
about $3,000 in assets over
liabilities.

correct.”

Huntley told the gathered
fraternity representatives that
he had heard expressions of
concern about W&L’s fraternity
system from the trustees, alum-
ni, faculty, townspeople. ‘‘Peo-
ple express irritiation at least,
anger at worst, and sadness
more often than not.”’

The areas which Huntley

feels need improvement are

“financial management, social
conduct, and structural or
house upkeep.”’

Asking for help, the universi-
ty president requested that
fraternity leaders ‘‘do what you
can for the school in this field.”’
Huntley stressed the point, ‘I
don’t know exactly what my
role is, but the fraternities’ role
is more important.”

As a long-time resident of the
W&L community, Huntley has
noticed a ‘slipping away of the
fraternity establishment as I
knew it.”’

“There was a time when
fraternity life was a positive ex-
perience and_ provided
reassurance in terms of roots,
friendships, companionship,
and the positive values in life,”’
he said.

“In the days when I was a stu-
dent here the fraternities were
a positive influence against the
negative values I have describ-
ed here, rather than a hotbed to
forment them.”

Huntley stressed the im-
portance of a fraternity during
the ‘‘transition between
boyhood and manhood.” He ad-
ded that fraternities were, at
one time, a reservoir of positive
values, not a place to shed all
moral principles.”

Suggesting a solution to the
problem, Huntley said, ‘What
we ought to do is create an en-
vironment in which positive
values are instilled.”’

“If Iam correct in my facts, a
kind of unarticulated wish ex-

“970707 0-0-0_0_0,0.6.8,'
ona atateta eee

ists in the social life, and the
quality of that life, a wish that it
were better.”’

Stressing a sense of duty,
Huntley told fraternity
members, ‘You have an obliga-
tion to make it better.’ He ask-
ed for a response, even if it was
that fraternity members were
“insensitive” or ‘ ‘‘don’t care.”’

Consistent with his emphasis
on response from the fraternity
men assembled, Huntley sat
down at the end of his speech
and seemed to be waiting for
some response, but he only
received applause.

Huntley rose again, and again
stressed the need for a student-
administration dialog in the
future before he left the room.

As the meeting broke up,
Huntley returned and began the
communication that he hopes
will lead to the rehabilitation of
the fraternity system.

Responding to criticism

Well, it’s nice to know
somebody reads my column.
My Nielson ratings haven't
been too high lately, and my
editor was thinking of pre-
empting me for re-runs of last
year’s editorials.

As for the implication that I
only make intellectually based
organizations targets for my
witticisms, I believe that frater-
nities as a whole have received
their fair share, and they don’t
exactly sit around discussing
Emmanuel Kant. I have men-
tioned the Film Society once
before in passing while the

fraternities have been pelted in
the majority of my articles.

As formothers not loving
snipers, my mother loves me
(Don’t you, Mom?), and I'd
also like it noted that I have
made a conscious effort to dif-
ferentiate myself from last
year’s The Nose Knows. I don’t
butt into people’s private af-
fairs, and I rarely make fun of
individuals.

As for my identity, you'd
never believe it. Isn’t that right

EC funds

W&L’s Varsity Sunbathing
Team announced plans yester-

Committee for $1,000 to fund a
training trip to Florida this spr-
ing.

Zonker Harris, coach of W &
L’s sunbathing team said, ‘“‘We
need the time in Florida so that
we can compete with the West
Coast Beach Pack 10 Teams.”
He added, ‘‘Florida’s climate
will prepare us better than
many of our Division III op-
ponents who cannot afford the
trip.”

Harris forsees little problem
in obtaining the money because
the lacrosse team received the
same amount from the E. C.
last week.

Coach Harris added that the
time spent in Florida will be us-
ed for training. ‘‘The team is
already paying for their own
essentials such as meals and
suntan oil,’’ Harris said. The
team has also raised a con-
siderable amount by selling
Polaroid Shades and straw
hats.

Harris deemed the trip essen-
tial with 90 percent of the team
taking ‘‘the dig’’ during the spr-
ing semester. The other 10 per-
cent, who are taking Total
Theater, will remain in Florida
an extra week to give the team
the competitive edge, Harris

NUMBER 18

Censures Freshman Rep.

 

Calvert’s Statement

Concerning what I feel to be the gross
negligence of an EC member on a
preliminary investigation: although this
situation regards the secrecy of an honor trial
and the discussion must remain in the third
person, this involves something of major im-
portance The Honor System.

This committee has gone to great lengths to
retain its impartiality both while in-
vestigating and hearing trials. It is the over-
whelming understanding of mine that the
committee has remained unbiased and fair
with all respect to the accused. Any contact
with the accused prior to the trial should be
avoided. Under no condition should a member
discuss with the accused any aspect of the
trial such as how he suspects the Committee
will render its decision, assessing his
chances, etc. If a member of the EC is con-
fronted by an accused he must “‘bite his
tongue,’’ so to speak.

Therefore, I feel it is imperative that we as

a committee address this question to restore
the confidence in our ability to review cases
impartially. We have the power to discipline
our own members — we must consider the
distasteful task if for no one else but
ourselves. However, the Honor System and
the Student Body deserve it.

The EC’s Statement

We, as a committee, wish to affirm our
dedication to impartiality and our commit-
ment to fairness. We recognize that, as in-
dividual members, we are not infallible. Fur-
ther, we realize that is is our responsibility to
insure that each of our members maintains
our standards of fairness and impartiality. In
this way, we hope to return the trust the Stu-
dent Body has placed in us.

 

 

Grade Review
Proposal Changed

by David Greer

A member of the stu-
dent body Executive
Committee was censured
Monday night and will
not be allowed to par-
ticipate in any EC func-
tions for four weeks.

The EC voted to suspend
freshman representative
Charlie Scott for misconduct
during a preliminary investiga-
tion of a possible honor viola-
tion.

Senior representative Rob
Calvert read a prepared state-
ment in which he stated that
there had been ‘‘gross
negligence of an EC member on
a preliminary investigation’’
and said that ‘‘we have the
power to disclipline our own
members.”

Calvert recommended
suspending Scott for one month,
stripping him of voting powers
and access to closed sessions.

Scott said that he had return-
ed from a trip out of town and
found a note on his door from a
student who was under in-
vestigation of a possible honor
violation. The note, which Scott
produced, said, ‘‘Charlie — see
me”’ and was signed by the ac-
cused.

Scott said, “I ignored the
message because I believed it
was improper to have any con-
tact with him.”’

‘Scott said that later that night

IFC
Allows

he was at a party at his fraterni-

ty house when he was approach-

ed by the accused.

Scott said that the accused
asked him some. procedural
questions and that he felt that it
was his responsibility as a
member of the EC to clarify
them.

‘My original intentions were
just to inform him of EC pro-
ceedures,”’ Scott said. Without
warning, the accused ‘‘just
came out of the blue and con-
fessed tome.”

After the accused confessed
the honor violation to Scott, he
said that he told the accused “‘I
can’t be impartial any more’”’
and he would have to step down
from proceedures. .

“I didn’t know how to handle
the matter after he confessed to
me,” said Scott, ‘‘I disqualified
myself”’ from the investigation.

Scott said that he asked the
accused how he knew who was
on the investigating committee
and the accused told him that he
had learned from friends.

Scott said, ‘‘The accused was
a friend of mine: he asked what
his chances are; I said, ‘What
do you think? After telling me
these things, what do you
think?’”’

“T told him he had to live with
any decision he made,”’ Scott
said, “I never spoke for the

committee, just as a friend, an
individual.”’

“It was never my intention to
give the accused any informa-

Scott’s Statement

I regret that I made an error in judgement
in my handling of the incident, for this I am
very sorry. At the time I thought that I was
acting solely as a friend and in no way in any
official capacity. I now recognize that the two
are inseperable. Things that are said on a
strictly friend to friend basis are often con-—
strued as official. I intended to act in my
capacity as an EC member only to inform the
accused of EC proceedure. I in no way at- .

_ tempted to commit an injustice to the accused

or to the Honor System but merely to give ad-
vice which was asked for by a friend.

in favor of a proposal for a five-
professor grade review board.

The all-professor grade
review board would hear the
complaint, the professor's

would have the power to over-
turn the original grade.

The faculty EC was quick to
respond to the new grade
review proposal, however,
voting it down 8-2 at their
meeting Tuesday, the Ring-tum
Phi has learned. The committee
was apparently divided along
strict faculty-student lines.

fered the proposal that disputed

Thursday

Parties

by John Billmyre

Although there is a by-law in
the I.F.C. constitution that pro-
hibits Thursday night parties,
fraternities will be allowed to
party on that night this week.
The Judicial Board of the Inter-
fraternity Council voted Tues-
day night in favor of lifting the
ban on weeknight parties this
week because of Fancy Dress.

LF.C. president Jim Davis
expressed some concern about
the matter saying, ‘‘We don’t
want the boom to come down on
Saturday — as a result of Thurs-
day and Wednesday night par-
ties.”’

Fraternities presented with a
summons on Thursday will
have their cases reviewed by
the I.F.C. Judicial Board.

Washington and Lee's
lacrosse team repaid the $1,000
loan granted them by the stu-
dent Executive Committee at
Monday night's EC meeting.

The money had been used to
help finance a training trip for
the team in Florida over the 10-
day mid-winter break.

Tri-captains Jeff Fritz, John
Black, and Sandy McDonald at-
tended the meeting to present
the $1,000 on behalf of the team.

“We feel we got a lot ac-
complished down there that we
couldn't have gotten done up
here because of the weather,”
Black told the EC, ‘‘and we'd
like to thank the EC for their
support.”

The money came from an
‘anonymous supporter,’’ Black
said.

The lacrosse team also gave
an unused $109 that was raised
by Cockpit entertainment to
help finance the training trip to
help support the Muscular

Dystrophy Dance Marathon.

In other action, the EC ac-
cepted a student petition which
requests the athletic depart-
ment to keep one gymnasium
available for student use.

Michael Gallagher in presen-
ting the 433-signature petition to
the committee said that both
basketball courts were used by
various athletic teams
throughout the day, preventing
students who do not participate
in an organized sport from ac-
cess to the gym.

“We're not against the
athletic teams using one gym.
but the athletic department
could work out a staggered
schedule if they were forced
to,’ Gallagher said.

“Don't except much,” said
Rob Calvert, senior EC
representative, who has also
been trying to open up the gym
himself, *‘People have been try-
ing to discourage me in my ef-
forts.”

Crimes Against Students Up

by John Pryor

A mini-crime wave has struck
both the Law School and the
town of Lexington.

The latest victim was
Suzanne’ Barnette whose
backpack was stolen from her
carrel last week. Perversely the
thieves removed the running
clothes she had in it and left
them in the Ladies Room.

That same evening, Bevin
Alexander’s backpack was
“removed,” but was later
dumped on another student’s
desk. Bevin’s only explanation
for its abandonment lies in the
unique ‘ugliness’ of the item
which deterred the felons.

These incidents followed a
wave of car vandalism in the
parking lots around campus.

At the beginning of the
semester Scott Rayson return-
ed to his car in the easily ac-
cessible Piney Woods only to
find a window smashed in and
his hiking boots gone.

By far the worst of the events
in the recent series was the
“trashing” of five cars belong-
ing to Baker Law Dorm
residents. Scott Tinnon, Dorm
Counselor, was the first to
notice the destruction, which
occurred sometime during the
early morning hours of Sunday,
Feb. 4.

The damage, which was
reported to the police, included
two cars with snapped aerials
(Scott Tinnon’s and_ the
author’s), one with a weather
cover stolen (Jeff Gray), and
one with a stolen distributor
wire (Pete Williams). In addi-
tion, Will Walls’ car was severe-

ly worked over, losing an aerial,
a side view mirror, two tail
pipes, and acquiring a smashed
in door.

Chief J.A. Kirby of the Lex-
ington Police Department notes
that there has been an alarming
increase in student related
crimes.

He has had numerous reports
of students losing items from
their cars, rooms and gym
lockers.

The official reports alone
since January 1 total nine.

Kirby estimates that approx-
imately 75 to 80 per cent of all
larcenies reported in the city
this year are phoned in by
students. The problem has got-
ten so severe that the police
department has separated the
student file from the other
reports.

A factor which has co licated
the investigation is the rash of

The Ring-tum Phi made an
error in the story last issue
about Clyde Mull buying the
Robert E. Lee Hotel.

Mrs. Edna Mull and her hus-
band own the _ property
equally. The court records in-
correctly list the grocery store
behind the hotel that Mull
bought as 17 N. Randolph St.
That address is the one for Flo's
Market, two blocks away.
The correct address for the
store purchased by Mull is not
known.

we're spread too thin.”’

He doesn’t see any immediate
possibility of hiring additional
security guards.

In the long run increased
security may be inevitable. In
the meantime students are urg-
ed to keep their possessions
locked up and cars parked in a
well-lit area.

Debate
Rescheduled

The Contact debate between
former Sen. Eugene McCarthy
and William Rusher has been
rescheduled for March 21.

The debate, which was
originally slated for Feb. 14,
was postponed due to the sud-
den illness of McCarthy.

The topic of the debate will be
“Directions for the 80’s’”’ and
will include a discussion of
issues likely to affect the United
States in the next decade.

Student Loan Default
Rate 10% At W&L

by Brian Gibson

The number of students who
default on their government-
guaranteed educational loans
has been a source of concern
both to the University Financial
Aid Department and to the U.S.
Department of Health, Educa-
tion, and Welfare over the last
few years.

Currently, there are two pro-
grams under which a student
may receive aid, the National
Direct Student Loan Program
and the Guaranteed Student
Loan Program.

The Department of HEW and
the University give a direct
grant to students sharing the
cost of college under a 90-10 per-
cent ration.

Under the other program,
HEW guarantees loans made
from a central lending agency,
here known as the Virginia
Educational Loan Authority.

These are agencies establish-
ed by the states which are em-
powered to sell bonds and loan
the resulting money to selected
students. Virginia also
guarantees loans made by
banks under this program.

While students are in school,
HEW pays 7 percent interest to
the lending agencies.

The percentage of people who
fail to repay their loans has
started to drop after a long
period of increases.

Nationally, the default rate of
the NDSLP is around 17 percent
while that of the GSLP has been
reduced from around 14 to 10.5
percent.

At Washington and Lee, the
default rate for both programs
is around 10 percent which ac-
cording to Dean Pate, Director

of Financial Aid, ‘compares
very favorably to the national
averages.”’

The reason our default rate is
so high is that many students go
on to graduate school and forget
to file a request for deferral of
payment each year, and when
they are contacted, these
“paper defaults’? are erased
from the school’s record but are
still included in the percen-
tages.

To make things easier for the
students, the University is cur-
rently switching from a
quarterly schedule of payments
to a monthly billing system.

This is being done to cushion
the shock of having to come up
with a large payment at the end
of each quarter. Also, the whole
American credit system is
geared to monthly payments,
Dean Pate said, and this will
also make it easier for students
to pay their loans back.

Overall, Washington and
Lee’s record under these pro-
grams compares’ very
favorably to other colleges
across the country.

Jack Anderson Speaks

Noted Journalists Attend W&L Conference

“Investigative reporting is
high-risk journalism,” Jack
Anderson told an Investigative
Reporters and Editors (1.R.E.)
workshop last weekend. ‘“Too_
many newsmen depend on hired
liars for information.”

Anderson was one of eight
Pulitzer Prize-winning _ in-
vestigative journalists who ad-
dressed the conference or took
part in panel discussions. The
conference took place at
Washington and Lee University
in Virginia and was organized
by Clark R. Mollenhoff
(Pulitzer, 1958), now professor
of journalism at W&L and for 25
years Washington correspon-
dent for the Des Moines
Register and Tribune.

About 150 journalists and
journalism students from
throughout the east attended
the three-day Potomac Region
I.R.E. workshop at Washington
and Lee.

In a provocative luncheon
talk, Jack Anderson declared
that ‘‘too many” journalists to-
day ‘‘are becoming creatures of
their keepers.’

“The state department
reporter,” he said, ‘often
begins to look like the foreign
diplomat, wearing tweed
jackets and puffing on a pipe.
The Pentagon reporter often
comes home looking like he just
got off maneuve; Each, in turn,
begins to write critical stories
of the other. Often this does give

us good stories -- but in a
strange way.

‘Press spokesmen are hired
to lie to us; they are expected to
lie,’’ Anderson said. ‘‘There is
not one of them who does not lie
professionally. I would fire a
reporter who would depend on
Jody Powell as a news source.
We don’t call Powell and ask
what is happening -- we call to
tell him what is happening and
ask if he has a comment.”

Again, disagreement.

Later that day, in the session
on Washington investigation the
Star’s Fialka commented: ‘‘Not
all public relations people lie.
Nine times out of 10 they just
don’t know the truth.”’

During his wideranging ad-
dress, Anderson ripped into the
Carter administration and its
attitude of what he called
‘almost inflexible moral cer-
tainty.

Carter gives the impression,
Anderson said, that he has a
direct line to God. And when
you have that, he said, ‘‘you
don’t have to pay much atten-
tion to Cyrus Vance.”

At one point Anderson
described Carter as “an in-
competent President relying on
incompetent advisors . . . an in-
experienced President relying
on inexperienced counselors.”
That, Anderson declared, is the
“big story” of White House
coverage.

Anderson described the role

of his own syndicated column,
‘“‘Washington Merry-Go-

Round,” as ‘a news service
covering the shady side of the
street.”

During the balance of the
weekend, it became evident
that a significant problem for
reporters themselves is defin-
ing how they should act and to
whom they should feel responsi-
ble.

There was a session too on
ethics, moderated by Dr. Louis
W. Hodges of Washington and
Lee. He is head of W&L’s pro-
fessional ethics program.
Among his panelists were A. E.
Fitzgerald, the U.S. Air Force
cost analyst who lost his job --
temporarily -- for whistle-
blowing, and Marvin Stone of
U.S. News and World Report.

Robert W. Greene of News-
day on Long Island, past I.R.E.
president, opened the con-
ference in Lee Chapel and set
the tone for many subsequent
speakers’ remarks. Speaking
on ‘‘Freedom of the Press,”
which he defined as ‘‘a simple
doctrine -- exempt from govern-
ment control,’’ Greene
paraphrased James Madison’s
warning: ‘In a free nation,
rights are not lost overnight;
they are gradually nibbled to
death.”’

Musical Mainstream

bu « Vark . Mainwaring

While considering some possi-
ble topics for this week’s col-
umn, it came to our attention
that one very important area of
popular music had _ been
neglected so far in Musical
Mainstream, that being the
world of singles, commonly
referred to as the top-40.

In order to rectify this over-
sight, we tracked down the
latest issue of Billboard, looked
up the top ten singles of the
week, and proceeded to
evaluate them in terms of basic
quality and, a more intangible
but at the same time very
crucial factor, just how good
they sound on AM radio.

One interesting fact turned up
in the process of reviewing
these singles; with a few excep-
tions, these songs tended to in-
spire more hedging and
qualifications than extreme
judgments one way or the other.
This would tend to reinforce the
commonly held view of top-40 as
bland and homogenized; you
can make your own judgments,
based on the following com-
ments.

Top Ten

1. Rod Stewart ‘Do Ya Think
I'm Sexy”

This one’s a. paradox. Rod
Stewart’s chief strength has
always been his ability to over-
come poor material with his
unique singing style and voice,
but in his latest effort his vocals
don’t even equal (much less
surpass) the mediocre but
passable melody.

‘Comparisons to the Stones’’
‘Miss You’ are inevitable:
both songs feature mainstream
rock artists moving into the
realm of disco, and it’s clear
that Stewart had the Stones’
summer hit in mind when recor-
ding “‘Do Ya Think I’m Sexy,”
conceptually if not melodically.

But Stewart isn’t Jagger, and
he comes across as bored and
narcissistic rather than confi-
dent and believable. At least
“Do Ya Think I’m Sexy”’ isn’t
Stewart’s commercial sell-out,

though — he did that a long time
ago.

2. Pointer Sisters ‘‘Fire”’

Another gift from the
magnanimous Bruce Springs-
teen, “‘Fire’’ has been moving
up the charts with unusual
speed for the past two weeks.
Taken from the standpoint of a
Springsteen fan, the Pointer
Sisters do a _ credible job
musically, especially in the way
they handle the bridge, which is
the song’s crucial point.

However, the fact remains
that ‘‘Fire” was conceived as a
boyish leer, almost in the same
vein as Rod Stewart’s
“Tonight’s the Night,’’ and the
Sisters simply cannot pull off
the difficult task of making the
song believable from a female
viewpoint.

From the standpoint of a
top-40 fan, the song has almost
nothing to recommend it; no
catchy chorus, no distinctive
riff, nothing to really grab you.
“Fire” is one of the more
unlikely, and also one of the
more pleasant, successes of the
year to date.

3. Olivia Newton-John ‘‘A Lit-
tle More Love”

Olivia may be ‘Totally Hot”’

and Robin < « Veredith

now, but ‘‘Little More Love’ is
only slightly less homogenized
than anything else she’s done.
Admittedly, the song iscon-
structed in a rather unique way,
and the way she deadpans the
title line is a real grabber, and
those slashing guitar chords
during the verses are a bit of a
shocker at first. But when you
get down to it, this is still the
same Olivia who favored us
with “Hopelessly Devoted to
You,” and some things just
don’t change.

4. Gloria Gaynor “I Will Sur-
vive”’

Gloria Gaynor’s latest is
1979’s_ version of “I Am
Woman,” an updated, upbeat
female anthem sweeping discos
across the country. The song
features a nice, slow opening,
the obligatory good beat and or-
chestration, and — surprise! —
even intelligent lyrics, a rare
commodity in the disco field.

5. Village People ‘‘Y.M.C.A.”’

Speaking of lyrics. . . okay, so
these are about as weak as they
come. One listen to the melody
and you don’t even care. This
song’s got what it takes — fast,
driving beat, a strong, brassy

A good old movie thriller from Brazil

by Dick Barron

There’s hope yet for the good-
ole movie thriller. I’m not talk-
ing about a Superman or a Star
Wars, but a believable down to
earth suspense film. I’m talking
about The Boys From Brazil
This film brings back the days
when films were solidly produc
ed and acted.

Take a look at the cast
Gregory Peck as Mengele, the
infamous Nazi doctor who hat-
ches a diabolical plot, Sil
Lawrence Olivier (who pro
trayed the hunted Nazi, Szell, in
Marathon Man) returning as a

Nazi hunter, Ezra Lieberman,
and James Mason as Mengele’s
colleague rounding out the list
of eloquent veteran actors.

Twists and shifts

It’s difficult to detail the plot

of The Boys without revealing

the surprise twists and shifts.
Let’s just say that Mengele is up
to something in the jungles of
south America — no one knows
quite what it is, and no one

cares, until an American youth
nosing around in Nazi country
Slips and falls into some very

messy foul play — Lieberman
finds out and the hunt is on.
Mengele moves ever onward
with his evil plans, while
Lieberman narrows the space
between himself and his prey.

The characters are actual
personalities, but the action is a
product of the imagination of
novelist Ira Levin. The idea
translates: well into the
screeplay and is given full life

with Robert
of editing
Gregory Peck never ceases to
amaze as he travels through his
as an acting institution

Swink’s steady job

career

Having starred recently as the
elusive General MacArthur, he
now switches sides to play a
steely-eyed war criminal. With
the aid of special makeup which
thickens his forehead, Peck
plays the: evil and thoroughly
corrupt doctor of Auschwitz,
darkening the screen with his
chilling prescence

Wretched Mason

James Mason iS wretched in
his own way, looking every bit a
gentleman with a taste for

(continued on page 7)

with painting: and continuing to
develop his wood carving and
silkscreen printing virtuosity.
These explorations have led to
the development of four new
series of work, three of which
will be on view when ‘Sculpture
Plus’’ opens.

Roberts has slipped into the
Washington art scene with sur-
prising ease. A series of his
silkscreen prints was exhibited
this past December at Huber
Gallery in Georgetown. He par-
ticipated in ‘‘36 Hours,” an un-
precedented event where
Walter Hopps, the nationally
known cavalier curator, col-
loborated with The Museum of
Temporary Art and hung every
work brought to the museum
over a straight 36 hour period.
Most recently, he was a part of
“Open City,” a program coor-
dinated by the Washington Pro-
ject for the Arts in which
several D.C. artists opened
their studios for public tours.

The public is invited to the
opening reception for the artist
Sunday, March 4, 3-5 P.M. at
Pobai’s Place, 101-A West
Nelson Street, Lexington. The
exhibit will run March 4-30 and
the gallery hours are 10-5,

Roadside Theatre group

presents historical drama

A true-history drama written
by two 1968 Washington and Lee
University graduates will be
presented next Thursday,
March 8, in W&L’s Troubadour
Theatre under the sponsorship
of the Glasgow Endowment for
the Arts. The free performance
will take place at 8 p.m.

The play is ‘‘Red Fox/Second
Hangin’’’ and was_ pieced
together by the W&L
classmates, Donald H. Baker
and Dudley D. Cocke Jr., from

courthouse records in Wise
County in far southwest
Virginia.

Their troupe, Roadside

Theatre, has presented ‘Red
Fox’’ to widespread critical ac-
claim, particularly in New
York, where it received rave
reviews from the New York
Times, Christian Science
Monitor, Village Voice and The
New Yorker.

The play re-tells the story of
M. B. (Doc) Taylor, a doctor,
surveyor and religious mystic
who was hanged for murder in
1893 in Wise County. In addition

to court records, Baker and
Cocke combed through old
newspapers and — ‘‘most im-

portantly,”’ they say — listened
to oral-history accounts by
older residents of the area who
remembered Doc Taylor or had
memorized stories passed down
in families.

‘“‘What they told us,’’ Cocke
says, ‘often contradicted the
‘book facts,’ but as it turned out,
their version was the one cor-
roborated at major points by
the court records we dug up.”’

The Roadside format is to tell

the story as just that — a story.
The ‘‘actors’’ on_ stage
sometimes portray characters,
but more often they are nar-
rators. They use no props or
costumes’

The New York Times called
“Red Fox’”’ “as stirring to the
audience for its historical detec-
tive work as for the vanishing
art of frontier yarnspinning.’’
The Christian Science Monitor
said the performance ‘“‘was a
remarkable entertainment, the
likes of which New York folks
don’t encounter every day.”
The New Yorker said the story
was presented ‘quietly and
with no pretensions whatever,

but with talent and charm.”’

As a backdrop to the per-
formance, vintage slides help il-
lustrate the story.

Roadside Theatre was found-
ed by Baker and others in 1974
“to find and create a kind of
theatre that makes sense for the
mountains.” It has reached into
the back hollows, mining camps
and farm communities of the
Appalachian where ‘‘conven-
tional theatre seldom, if ever,
travels.”

The group is part of Ap-
palshop, a non-profit media
organization in Whitesburg,
Ky., that produces records,

melody, and the easiest lyrical
hook to hit AM radio in ages.
Let’s face it, who can’t sing
“Y.M.C.A.”’ at the top of their
lungs while driving down the
highway.

6. Bee Gees ‘‘Tragedy”’

The Bee Gees do it again —
nothing short of a plane crash is
gonna stop these guys. The
words don’t match the melody
and feel of the song, but
flawless production and the
group’s writing skills pull this
one off with ease. Warning: the
high-pitched vocals may get on
your nerves after a while (ya
sure these guys are brothers? ).

7. Chic ‘Le Freak”

Without a doubt the most an-
noying thing about AM radio
over the past few months has
been the overwhelming suc-
cess, in both airplay and sales,
of ‘‘le Freak.’’ The song’s ap-
peal is quite frankly beyond
me; it doesn’t even work as a
novelty.

It’s groups like Chic that give
disco a bad name. The
teenybopper elitism inherent in
‘Le Freak”’ is so revolting that
it tends to stick in people’s
minds much longer than an in-
nocuous but well crafted single
like Earth, Wind, & Fire’s
“September.”

March in the Cockpit...

Although all the student
minds are concentrating on
Fancy Dress this weekend,
there will be plenty of entertain-
ment on campus this month.

The Skip Castro Band will
make its debut in the Cockpit on
March 14, a Wednesday night.
They play a very varied songlist
ranging from the Beatles to Ray
Charles, from Elvis Costello to
Otis Redding. In short, they are
a band that COOKS, and they
will receive plenty of exposure
on this campus in the next few
months. See them in the Pit

warmly received by the crowd,
and thrilled them with the
sounds of Jimmy Buffett and
other folk favorites.

Chris Smither is a
singer/songwriter who comes
from the D. C. area and has
played for many different peo-
ple in many different settings.
Bonnie Raitt has done his songs,
and many others. He plays folk
guitar in the style of John Hurt
and Lightnin’ Hopkins. Look for
this guy — he is what Jackson
Browne was five years ago. The
date for the show is still in the
air at this time, however.

Wed., March 28 sees the
Chicken Spankers arrive in
Lexington for the first time.
They play predominantly old
time music with some modern
embellishments. The following
night, the Fiction Brothers will
perform. Flying Fish recording
artists, they have a record
where they play with Country
Cooking, a highly acclaimed
“newgrass” band. Howie Tar-
nower and Alan Senauke play
their guitars, mandolins and
banjo on many of their own

joyable.

The following night, March
30, Dodge d’Art will perform.
This Charlottesville three piece
band plays many of rock’s
greatest songs from the Sixties
— from the Animals, Beatles
and others, as well as original
compositions. This will be their
first appearance in the Cockpit,
and many of the students will
also hear them at the M.D.
Danceathon.

March certainly looks like it
will be a great month for music
in the Cockpit. Make your plans
now.

8. Nicolette Larson ‘Lotta
Love”’

“Lotta Love”’ is classic Neil
Young, and as such is one of the
loveliest, most addictive
melodies to hit top-40 so far this
year. Unfortunately, the same
slickness that allowed Nicolette
Larson’s version to top the
charts also served to undermine
some of the simple character of
the song, as revealed in Young’s
grittier acoustic version from
the Comes a Time album
(which, by the way, featured
Ms. Larson on_ background
vocals).

9. Barry Manilow
“Somewhere in the Night”

It starts out quietly, just
piano and vocals. Building up
slowly, the song reaches a
veritable crescendo, then fades
slowly into oblivion. But the
question remains: haven’t we

heard this before? Like, last
time, and the time before that,
and...?

Barry Manilow is basically
good at what he does, but he
might be well advised to start
doing it a little bit differently.
“Somewhere in the Night’’ is
throwaway pop of the most
pretentious sort.

10. Leif Garrett “I Was Made
For Dancin’”’

Leif Garrett is one of the chief
perpretrators of a new fad that
can best be described as ‘‘bub-
blegum disco.”’ His singles are
classic top-40 in every way;
light, disco-influenced numbers
with extremely catchy hooks
and just enough gimmickry and
flash to grab the youth market
without alienating the

housewives. If he just didn’t
sound so much like Robin Gibb
after a very painful and damag-
ing accident he might have
something. ~

EC, “I never at any time in-
formed him of any results of
closed-door deliberation ‘‘

Scott said that he told the ac-
cused he would have to live with
any decision he made and told
him ‘“‘you can’t be optimistic.”’

Sophomore representative
Willy Mackie said that he had
heard the story from several
sources, including the accused,
and that “the whole chain of
events was really quite dif-
ferent.”

Mackie said, ‘‘He (the accus-
ed) was concerned about what
he had done and you (Scott)
gave him the opinion that he
didn’t have a chance’’ before
the trial. ‘‘What was
represented to him was that
something happened and it was
automatic guilt.”

Mackie also said that he had
heard that the accused also ap-

who told him not to ask him
about the proceedings.

Scott said that he was speak-
ing to him just as a friend, not
as a member of the committee.

Senior law representative
John Murphy then said, ‘‘He ap-
proached you (Scott) first as an
EC member, and it is hard for
his view of you to change. He
was still looking at your opinion
as revealing what the EC
thought.”

Junior. representative Steve
Abraham and Calvert both
questioned the testimony given
by the accused, pointing out
some discrepancies each time
Scott related his account of the
incident.

Junior representative Dee
Keesler said, “The story has
been watered down each time
Charlie has told it.’’

Scott said, “We are all
capable of making errors in
judgment and I deeply regret
making contact with the accus-
ed. I think the reprimand Rob
has proposed is severe, too
severe.”

Scott added, “I think I should
be allowed to admit my
mistakes and take my lumps
but I shouldn’t be kicked off the
committee for four weeks.”

When asked if he had been
drinking that night, Scott
said,”I wasn’t fully in control
(of myself) that night; I con-
sumed quite a bit of grain”

Law Election

Neal Brickman was the victor
in the election two weeks ago to
fill the first year law school
representative’s position on the
student Executive Committee.

Brickman compiled 46 votes
to Bevin Alexander’s 36 to win
the EC spot vacated by Jenelle
Mims one month ago.

Brickman was present at
Monday night’s EC meeting to
begin his term on the commit-

“tee.

before talking to the accused.

“I can assure the committee
that nothing of this nature will
ever happen again.”

The EC voted 8-1, with
Keesler voting against and Rob
Benfield abstenting, to suspend
Scott from the EC for four
weeks, starting then.

First year law representative
Neal Brickman expressed con-
cern for the lack of representa-
tion of the freshman class dur-
ing Scott’s absence, but the EC
could find no way to appoint so-
meone to the post temporarily.

Murphy pointed out that it
would be like the absence of law
school representatives during

Co-ed Course Offered

A course dealing with the role
of men and women in contem-
porary society will again be of-
fered during the spring term
this year.

Washington and Lee students
enrolled in the three credit
course, Interdepartmental 250,
will be required to live in a dor-
mitory on the Mary Baldwin
College campus for four weeks
with the girls taking the course.

The co-ed dorm is part of the
‘‘living-learning’’ experience of
the course, which will make an
in-depth examination of all
aspects of masculine and
feminine roles in American
society today and in other
cultures.

Five W&L professors and a
similar number of Mary
Baldwin professors will all
teach a part of the course,

which will be structured on lec- °

tures and panel discussions.
As now planned, students will

 

Rent Your Skis From Us

 

attend class Monday through
Thursday morning for two and
one-half hours. In addition,
there will be outside lectures,
films, and other activities.

It is hoped that the living
situation will foster out-of-class
discussions of the topics raised
during the day.

The course will be limited to a
total of 30 W&L and Mary
Baldwin students.

The University will pay for
the room, but not the meals.
Students on the dining hall meal
plan here can transfer their
credit to Mary Baldwin’s dining
hall for no extra charge.

Interested students should
see Dean Craun in his office in
Washington Hall to register.

Lax team pays back
EC with $1,000 gift

by Douglas Linton

The Varsity Lacrosse team is
pleased to make two favorable
reports. Along with the Florida
trip being a great success, the
team was also able to return
$1000 to the Executive Commit-
tee.

Through the generosity of an
anonymous gift, the team hand-
ed the E.C. a check to repay the
scandalous $1000 appropriation
made before winter break. The
matter caused numerous
unpleasant reactions on the
part of the student body. Head
Coach Jack Emmer was ‘‘very
happy to be able to return it.”’

The trip to Boca Raton went
like clockwork. The only pro-
blem, if it can be called such,
was. the long bus ride. The
players all stayed in one big
dormitory room and had an
11:30 p.m. curfew.

There were two practices dai-
ly. Workouts were divided into
two sessions, 2 hours each mor-
ning and about 1!» hours during
the afternoon. Since there were
no other teams down there, all
scrimmages were on an inters-
quad level. Nonetheless, the ac-
tion was quite fierce.

‘We had real good weather
and got a whole lot done that we
couldn’t have otherwise,’’ said
Emmer. He also felt that the
trip enabled him to get a better
look at many players, a view
impossible to obtain inside a
gymnasium. With all the extra
time spent on fundamental
skills and conditioning, Emmer
feels that ‘‘we have to be bet-
=.

The players all seemed to en-
joy themselves. Veterans
Roman Kupecky, John Herbert,
and Joe Olive all displayed their
consistently strong play, among
others. Freshman additions
Mike Pressler and Rob
Staugaitis both show lots of
potential. Coach Emmer also
felt that John Hooper had a
great week. He seemed to enjoy
the opportunity to hit people in
the open field. It was Hooper
who checked Perry Roberts and
broke his collarbone in three
places. Roberts’ injury was
viewed as unfortunate by Em-
mer, but also as ‘‘part of the
game.”

The Generals open their
season with an exhibition game
against the Chesapeake
Lacrosse Club on Saturday. The
contest may be played on
Wilson Field, but that will de-
pend on the weather, since the
field is so muddy. Alternatives
include playing on an upper
practice field, or possibly
traveling to Buena Vista.

Along with Mt. Washington,
Chesapeake is the club team to

beat this year. Coach Emmer
plans to experiement and “try
to get a look at everybody” as
he uses this foreign opposition
to find any weak areas in the
Generals’ game.

Generals lose to Lynchburg
in ODAC semifinals —

finish season at 17-10

by Bill Whalen

A basketball season which
began way back on November
24, finally ended when the
Washington & Lee Generals lost
to Lynchburg in the semifinals
of the ODAC Tournament. For
the Generals, the Lynchburg
loss concluded their season with
a 1710 record, which included
losses in three of their last four
games.

W&L left the Warner Center
with a 16-7 mark, to embark on

a two game road trip to
Maryville (Tennessee) and
Oglethorpe (Georgia). The
Generals soon found out that
“Southern hospitality’’ does not
exist as they lost to Maryville
on February 17, 80-68. The
twelve point difference
reporesents the largest margin
of a W&L loss this year. The
following Monday, the Generals

Indoor track season ends —

outdoor track to start Mar. 9

by Greg Branan

The Washington and Lee
Generals’ indoor track team cut
their winter break in half and
managed a third place team
finish in last Saturday’s ODAC
Championship meet at Lyn-
chburg College.

Coach Norris Aldridge spoke
about the meet saying, ‘‘We did
as well as_ expected.’’
Bridgewater and Lynchburg
dominated the meet, exchang-
ing first place throughout the
meet. The final tally gave
Bridgewater-78, Lynchburg-70,
W&L-36, Emory and Henry-32,
and Roanoke-21.

Aldridge noted, ‘‘Emory and
Henry took points in the sprints
and Bridgewater took a man off
basketball who scored three
firsts, 18 points.’’ These proved
to be the difference in a few
events W&L had planned to
score in.

Top performer for W&L was
tri-captain, Jack Norberg.
Norberg scored first in the 440,
second in the 60, was a member
of the winning mile relay team
and the second place 440 relay
team. His 51.5 time in the open
440 is a new ODAC record sur-
passing the old mark of 52.3.

- Other members of the winn-
ing mile relay team were
Stewart Atkinson, Ron Calkins,
and Dave Cordell. Those on the
400 relay team were Norberg,
Atkinson, Jeff Brown and Chris
Leiser.

Other point getters included
freshman Russ Rector, fifth in
the high jump and high hurdles,
Chris Daniel, third in the 880,
Chris Leiser, fourth in the 60
and the two-mile relay team of
Henry Hairston, Chris Daniel,
Paul Hendry and Billy Morris
came in fourth. In the field
events Phil Dunlay took second
in the 35-pound weight and fifth
in the shot-put, Moose Mrlik,
placed fifth in the 35-pound
weight and Bob Campbell plac-
ed fifth in the pole vault.

Coach Aldridge reiterated,
“We start in January, later
than other teams, and so the in-
door season is used as a
building up season for outdoor
track.” Outdoor track gets
underway March 9 at home
against Roanoke and Liberty
Baptist. Aldridge added, ‘‘The
outdoor season is usually
stronger than the indoor season.
Reasons include new events
such as the 220, intermediate

hurdles, discus and javelin
which are events we have depth
and experience in.’’ The season
appears to be tough with meets
against improved Liberty Bap-
tist, Emory and Henry, and
Davidson teams, as well as
always strong Wake Forest.
This difficult schedule might
not show that this year’s team is
“as good or better than last
year’s,”’ as Coach Aldridge has
stated.

the score of 85-77. 85 points turn-
ed out to be an ominous total for
Washington and Lee, as they
would find out against Lyn-
chburg.

Because the Generals and
Lynchburg had identical 7-3
ODAC records, a coin toss was
held to determine who would
receive the first round bye in
the tourney. Lynchburg won
and W&L, being the third-
seeded team, played the sixth-
seeded team, which turned out
to be the hometown
Bridgewater Eagles.

W&L appeared to be heading
for their third consecutive loss
as they trailed at halftime 44-43.
However, 59 percent shooting in
the next twenty minutes enabl-
ed the Generals to gain a
rematch with Lynchburg by
beating Bridgewater 81-75. Tom
Jeffries paced W&L with 18
points.

The next night, February 23,
came the most heated rivalry in
the ODAC as W&L took on Lyn-
chburg. W&L was_ playing
without center Ardith Collins,
who had broken his right elbow
while trying to block a shot
against Bridgewater. The loss
of Collins made a definite dif-
ference in the game. In his last
game against Lynchburg, Col-
lins dominated the game by
pulling down fifteen rebounds
and blocking five shots.

The Generals appeared to
have the game under control by
holding a 79-74 lead with two
minutes to play. Then center E.
D. Schechterly of Lynchburg
personally outscored the W&L
11-5, and his layup with 35
seconds left won the game. The
Generals had one more chance
to win but they took three shots
and none would fall. Pete Far-
rell’s last second jumper bounc-
ed in and out of the basket and
went halfway through before
popping out. For the third time
this year, Farrell was left
holding the bag by missing the
final shot.

The Lynchburg victory, only
their second in the last ten en-
counters with W&L (and both
were this year), ended the
Generals’ hopes of a_ third
straight ODAC title and a fifth

SID Bill Schnier

to take position
at Old Dominion

by Bill Whalen

According to an _ article
printed in the Lexington News-
Gazette on February 21,
Washington & Lee Sports In-
formation Director William R.
“Bill” Schnier has resigned his
post to become the new Sports
Information Director at Old
Dominion University. Schnier’s
resignation is effective April 6,
when the current semester
ends. Schnier will begin his
duties at the Norfolk, Virginia
school on April 9.

Having been appointed to his
position at W&L in 1976, Schnier
has revamped the W&L Sports
Information Office to the point
where it has received national
attention as one of the best Divi-
sion III organizations. Thirteen
of his brochures have received
citations from the College
Sports Information Directors of
America. Five of these
brochures have earned “Best in
the Nation’ awards for ex-
cellence.

Besides preparing these
brochures, Schnier also keeps
statistics on all W&L varsit™

releases. He also is in charge of

Franke is Co-Coach of year

by Chris Sisto

Last week the Washington
and Lee wrestling team came
away with several honors that
distingushed them as the best of
the winter here. The Generals
won ODAC Conference Tourna-
ment at Lynchburg College and
became the first team at W&L

to win a conference champion- .

ship this year.

Also at the tournament Coach
Gary Franke of the Generals
was named co-Coach of the
Year for the second year of his
six year coaching tenure at
W&L.

The league title was the third
straight for the Generals in the
three years of the ODAC. The
Generals are also undefeated in
dual meet play in the history of
the ODAC. The strength of the
win came.on Joe Wallace’s pin
at the heavyweight class. His
win, the last final weight class
of the tournament, gave the
Generals a seven point victory.
The Generals finished with 86%
points followed by Lynchburg
with 7934, Hampden-Sydney 49,

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

On EC

Marathons

With the biggest social weekend of the year now
upon us, you would expect the SAB to become the only
source of campus activity. Not so...last Monday, the
EC met for a marathon three hours — their longest
meeting since budget hearings in the fall — in one of
the most heated sessions of the year.

At that meeting, still another grade review proposal
was debated and passed. The Ring-tum Phi has
previously gone on record as an advocate of some
sort of grade review, and it is our hope that a
reasonable proposal will be passed by both EC and
faculty this year. Unfortunately, we doubt that the
EC’s present proposal has much chance of success in
a faculty vote.

Previously, the EC suggested that the authority to
overturn an unjust grade be placed in the hands of the
head of the department involved. Hopefully, he would
possess the necessary knowledge to judge a student’s
case. But the new motion provides for a 5-man com-
mittee of faculty ‘‘grade-reviewers,’’ and it is likely
that none of them will feel they have sufficient exper-
tise to change the decision of a professor in another
department. Even more, such a proposal may cause
unnecessary conflict and resentment among the
faculty as a whole. We strongly suggest that some
other alternative be found by the EC...The faculty
fangs are going to love chewing up this latest idea.

* EK

In an even more astounding action, the EC voted to
suspend one of its own members for one month for
revealing details of an honor investigation to a friend
under accusation. To our knowledge, this hasn’t been
done in many years — and it’s no.easy task at any
time.

I suppose it’s only human to sympathize with the
suspended member who, caught off guard, forgets the
all-important distinction between ‘‘friend’’ and
“elected official.’ Still, the EC’s action was fully
predictable and typical of their serious concern for all
aspects of the Honor System. As one student said, ‘‘A
crack in the chain just can’t be allowed.’’ At any rate,
we hope this is a lesson that won't call for repetition —
depriving, as it does, an entire class of EC representa-

tion.

Dear Editor:

I was shocked by the editorial ‘‘A question
of honor’ from your last issue.

First, I was surprised by your general lack
of compassion for this fellow student. He’s
been through a lot, and deserves the right to
complete his last half year. You should at
least grant him that before kicking him into
the mud.

More importantly, I question your reason-

but things like this offend our dignity and I
challenge anyone to call it honorable. The
other involved a student throwing a bottle at
the UVa bench during a lacrosse game (we
were even winning by 7 or 8 goals). This ac-
tion was not only disgusting but illegal.

These actions made me ashamed to be a
student here. But, they were honorable
enough by our conventions to escape serious
punishment. Throwing someone out of school
is a serious matter (ask the E.C.) and it is
unbelievable that the editor is getting involv-
ed in this matter. I wonder what our definition
of honorable is, too. I don’t think it is very
honorable to begin our search with a purge of
this student any more than purging our noise
violation convicts.

Legal Consultant Clarifies Point

Dear Editor:

In the article entitled ‘‘Students Who Took
Their Landlord to Court and Won,” which ap-
peared in the February 15th edition of The
Ring-tum Phi, it was stated that, as a conse-
quence of her tenants’ enforcing against her,
by legal proceedings, the duty to make pro-
mised repairs, the landlady will, in the future,
attach an addendum to all of her leases ab-
solving her from all responsibility to make
repairs. It should be noted that, where the
Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act
applies, such a general disclaimer is ineffec-
tual.

The Virginia Residential Landlord and Te-
nant Act requires the landlord to ‘‘[c] comply
with the requirements of applicable [local]
building and housing codes materially affec-
ting health and safety,” to ‘‘m Jake all
repairs and do whatever is necessary to put
and keep the premises in a fit and habitable
condition,” and to ‘‘ m Jaintain in good and
safe working order and condition all elec-
trical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ven-
tilating, air-conditioning and other facilities
and appliances. . . supplied or required to be
supplied by him.’’ However, the tenant can be
made to assume responsibility for ‘specified
repairs, maintenance tasks, alterations and
remodeling” (emphasis added) if he assents
to provisions in a written lease or other
writing that so provide.

As I stated in my article entitled
“Understanding a Lease and What it
Covers,” which appeared in the February
15th edition of The Ring-tum Phi, the provi-

lease. And the provisions of the Act quoted in

Dear Editor:
Many people on this campus, as well as

many members of this town, are under a
great misconception about fraternities at W &
L. These people think frats consist entirely of
spoiled rich kids who have unlimited financial
reserves. This, however, is the exception
rather than the rule. Many frat members pay
for their dues out of their own pocket or
through financial loans. Nevertheless,
regardless of where the money comes from,
paying anywhere from $1,000 to $1,700 per
year just to be in a house is not cheap. Not
everyone can afford to be a member, and
many make great financial sacrifices to stay
active.

Frats, as a whole, don’t have unlimited
funds either. Several houses are currently
taking a “financial bath,’”’ and the ‘“‘rich”
house has become a dying species. Yet, many
students mooch off frats at their social func-
tions as if they were some sort of charity
events.

Being a ‘‘guest”’ in a frat house (regardless
of whether you’re a member of another frat or
not) is a privilege, not a right. Frats can close

exceptions. This should lead the alert reader
to conclude that Mrs. Brown, the landlady in
question, may not effectively disclaim all
liability for repairs by amending her form of
lease.

This incapacity is stated in statutory form
in section 55-248.9 of the Code of Virginia: ‘‘A
rental agreement lease] shall not contain
provisions that the tenant. . . a]grees to the
exculpation or limitation of any liability of the
landlord to the tenant arising under law. . .
A]provision prohibited by ... this section in-
cluded in a rental agreement is unen-
forceable...’’

The reader should be aware that the
Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act
governs all apartment rentals. The only ex-
ception to this statement that is of importance
to The Ring-tum Phi’s readership is apart-
ments which the university rents to students.
The Act does not apply to them. (If a law does
not apply to a given situation or condition,
then the law neither confers benefits, imposes
obligations, nor operates in any manner upon
the parties as to whom it does not apply. As to
them, it is as if the law did not exist.) The Act
also does not apply to rented one-family
houses that are used and occupied as one-
family houses.

For example, if one group of students rents
an entire house as a group, under a single
lease, the Act does not apply to that sitaution;
and the lease that the group obtains from the
landlord will, for the most part, define the
rights and obligations existing between the
group members and the landlord. But if two
or more differnet parts of a house are rented
to different tenants or groups of tenants,
under separate leases, then the Act does app-
ly.

Yours sincerely,

their doors anytime to anyone they choose.
They pay for the parties, it is their house; and
it is their decision as to who can attend their
functions. Contrary to popular belief the
University does not finance these parties;
consequently, they are not meant to be
“university” social functions.

A final intangible is the entertainment fac-
tor. The frat members pay ‘“‘out the nose”’ so
you can have a good time, but how many
times have you thanked them for it, how
many times have you offered to help cover
their costs, how many times have you offered
to clean up after the party was over, how
many times has it even entered your mind? In
my experience, not often; but it is greatly ap-
preciated when such miracles happen.

Therefore, I would like to make a small sug-
gestion to all of you who by some rare chance
find nothing to do around here and just decide
to drop in on one of the frat parties (whether
you’re a frat member or a non-member) —
Don’t abuse your privilege! It can be taken
away.

Grade Review

(continued from page 1)
fessors.
Deadlock Over
Proposal

Discussion began with a pro-
posal by junior representative
Steve Abraham that a commit-
tee of faculty and students be
formed to review grade
disputes. ‘‘This might alleviate
some of the problems of depart-
ment heads not dealing with
complaints,” he said.

But under Abraham’s pro-
posal, the joint student-faculty
grade review committee would
not have the power to overturn
the professor’s grade.

“Schools that have commit-
tees like that seem to have them
break down,”’ said Will Mackie’
sophomore rep.

“But we can’t tell teachers
how to do their job,’’ Abraham
responded. ‘‘No teacher at this
school would like being told how
to grade.”’

‘“‘Faculty members would feel
it an infringement on _ their
rights to have their grades over-
turned,’’ Bill Tucker, EC vice
president said.

“If it doesn’t have the power
to overturn grades, then it (the
committee) wouldn’t achieve

‘much,”’ Mackie said

“Telling a professor that he
has to come before a committee
of appointed students and ap-
pointed faculty is not going to be
accepted warmly,” Brickman
added.

‘“‘We should be realistic about
what we can get through,”
Tucker said.

After some debate, third-year
law school representative John
Murphy recommended that the
grade review proposal be pass-

ed in its latest form (with the
‘ department head acting as an
intermediary between the pro-
fessor and the student).

It was at this point that
Brickman brought out his idea
for an all-faculty committee.

Such a committee would ‘‘get
rid of the outlandish claims’’
that might be made by students
complaining about trivial or
farfetched grading practices.

“Only legitimate claims
would be heard and professors
would be more willing to go
before a committee of peers,”
Brickman said.

Under Brickman’s plan,
students would petition the
standing five-man faculty com-
mittee, a convenient hearing
date would be set for the pro-
fessor and the student to pre-
sent their sides, and the five-
man board would have the
power to overturn a colleague’s
grade.

‘‘There’s a chance that no one
will want to serve on a commit-
tee like this,’ cautioned Rob
Calvert, senior EC represen-
tative, “‘but they should be re-
quired to serve”’ on such a com-
mittee.

The student Executive Com-
mittee voted unanimously to ac-
cept Brickman’s proposal.

After its defeat by the faculty
EC Tuesday, the new grade
review plan will probably come
before the University Council
this afternoon at 4:30 p.m. in
Payne Hall 2.

The faculty next meets as a
group Monday, and that faculty
meeting will be the last chance
to adopt a grade review system
before the semester is over.

 

Latest Student EC Variation To
The Grade Review Proposal

(Rejected By Faculty EC 8-2)

“It is the responsibility of each professor to:

i Provide at the beginning of the course a tentative schedule of
assignments and a description of how the final grade will be deter-

mined.

2. Be willing to discuss and review all aspects of a student’s grade
throughout within a reasonable time after receipt of the grade.

3. Retain throughout the next term all graded material not returned

to the student.

Any student believing that his work has been unfairly evaluated
has the right to bring the matter to the attention ofa standing com-
mittee of five faculty members. A closed hearing will then be held
at which the committee shall discuss the grade with the professor
and the student involved. The faculty committee shall be em-
powered to change a student's grade when a majority of the com-

mittee deems it appropriate.

(continued from page 1)

Gallagher encouraged the
committee to act in behalf of the
student body. He recommended
that the EC present a copy of
the petition to William D.
McHenry, athletic director, and
to the University administra-
tion, ‘‘otherwise he’ll
(McHenry) throw it in the
trash,’’ Gallagher said.

The EC agreed to form a
“liaison committee’ to present
the petition to McHenry in the
hope that guidelines for gym
use will be set up to allow more
students access to the basket-
ball courts.

More Noise

A Washington and Lee
University student was found
guilty of violating Lexington’s
noise ordinance.

Henry Young Hamilton,
president of Kappa Alpha, pled
guilty to violating the ordinance
on Sunday, January 21, at 1:15
a.m.

Hamilton was fined $15 and
court costs.

Hamilton told the court that
the fraternity had a band play-
ing and that their party had
started late and thus was play-
ing beyond the time their noise
permit allowed.

EC Reduces
Scott’s Penalty

by David Greer

The suspension of censured

EC member Charlie Scott was
shortened by two weeks by the
Student Executive Committee
Monday night.
Junior representative Steve
Abraham said he felt that the
month suspension of freshman
representative Chariie Scott
was too long and should be
shortened.

Scott was suspended for a
month last week for talking
about an honor violation in-
vestigation to the student in-
volved.

Abraham said he felt Scott
had made ‘‘an honest mistake”’
and that ‘‘a month was too long
for the EC to be without a
representative and a class to be
without a representative.”

Abraham proposed lessening
the suspension, adding, ‘‘If the
committee doesn’t feel what I
say is correct, we should ap-
point the president of the
freshman class to fill in.”

Senior representative Rob
Calvert, who initiated the pro-
ceedings against Scott last
week, said it ‘‘was not a per-
sonal attack on Charlie’ and
that he stood by the four week
suspension.

Sophomore representative
Will Mackie said, ‘‘We do have
the power to fill vacancies’ on

the committee, but that here
“the EC does not have a vacant
post — it’s a new issue about a
temporary issue.”

Mackie added, ‘‘We have
achieved what we wanted and
shown how serious we are.”’

The EC voted 9-2 to allow
Scott to return to his duties on

the EC after next week’s
meeting.
Sophomore representative

Bob Willis said later that he was
not in favor of reducing the
penalty, but he was less in facor
of having the freshman class
without a representative for a
month.

In other business, the
lacrosse team said they wanted
the $109 back that the EC gave
to the Muscular Dystrophy
Committee on their behalf last
week.

The EC had been given the
$109 when it loaned the team
money to go to Florida. When
the team paid off the loan, the
EC voted to give the $109 to MD.

Lacrosse team tri-captain
Sandy McDonald said that the
team had not intended to give
the money to MD, that it had
raised the money in the Cockpit
with the MD committee. The
two organizations were to split
proceeds from the function in
the Cockpit.

(continued on page 12)

Participants In MD

Dance Marathon Needed

 

An all-expense paid trip to
Disney World is the prize for the
person who raises the most
money for the Dance Marathon.

In discussing the Marathon,
coordinator Jay Blumberg,
urges anyone who has registra-
tion forms to return them. The
forms should be given to Carol
Chappell.

Blumberg added that he is not
worried by the small number of
participants, two or three, at
this time. He attributes the pro-
blem to people’s concern with
Fancy Dress.

In order to boost participation
a fraternity Field Day is
scheduled for the Friday of the
marathon. Events include a pie-
eating contest, an egg toss anda
tug-of-war.

Fraternities have made other
efforts to help. Pi Kappa Phi
postponed its formal, scheduled
for that weekend. Sigma Chi did
not, because it had already
scheduled a band and reserved
facilities in Richmond.

Blumberg also plans to ask
fraternities not to have parties
that weekend.

tage of the weekend is on pages 6 and 7.

IFC Holds Election Monday

by John Billmyre

The I.F.C. announced its elec-
tion schedule Tuesday night.

On Thursday night (tonight)
nominations will be taken for
the offices of president and vice
president. The election will be
held the following Monday at
the time of the Big Three elec-
tion.

Houses are allowed to have
only one representative in the
election.

Nominations for Judicial
Board will be taken at Tues-
day’s IFC meeting.

Pi Kappa Alpha president
Frank Ellerby was issued a
summons at 1:30 Sunday morn-
ing for violating Lexington’s
noise ordinance. —

However, progress seems to
have been made in the noise or-
dinance situation despite the
Pika summons. Instead of ar-
resting fraternity presidents
upon receiving complaints this
weekend, Lexington police
issued warnings. Summons
were issued only after a warn-
ing.

According to Interfraternity
Council president Jim Davis

“Three houses were warned,

two turned their systems down,

one didn’t.”” Pika was the only

house to receive a summons
weekend.

Also scheduled at Tuesday’s
meeting was a plan to donate
kegs for the Dance Marathon.
Davis said, ‘‘We are asking you
to donate a keg per house and
it’s the only contribution we’re
asking.”

Fraternity representatives
were also presented with a let-
ter designed to obtain informa-
tion concerning fraternity con-
ditions.

Two questions are posed in

the letter: “1. Do you feel there
are any problems in your
fraternity as it functions now?
2. What can be done to solve
these problems?”’

Presidents were reminded to
keep in mind different aspects
of their fraternities such as in-
spections, police, I.F.C., SAC,
morale, behavior and internal
discipline.

The I.F.C. has requested a
one- to two-page reply which the
Judicial Board will relay to

President Huntley.

Davis said he _ hopes
presidents “‘realize the implica-
tions of this letter.”’

Big Three Election
Set For Monday

Two students filed petitions to the student. Ex-
ecutive Committee for the Big Three election next
Monday and another announced his candidacy late

Tuesday.

Junior Steve Abraham filed a petition to run for

next year’s student

body president.

Junior

Christopher Burnham announced that he is also runn-
ing for president as a write-in candidate.

Junior Les Cotter filed a petition with the EC to run
for vice-president. There were no petitions filed for
the secretary’s position at Monday’s EC meeting.

Late Wednesday, Cove Geary announced that he
would be a write-in candidate for the secretary’s posi-

tion.

EC vice-president Bill Tucker said in Monday’s EC
meeting that he was “extremely disappointed, not in
the quality of applicants we got, but in the lack of par-

ticipation.”’

The candidates will give speeches tonight in Lee
Chapel at 7. The elections will he held Mandav

Candidates For Presidency Square Off On Issues

Steve Abraham

“I was disappointed by .the small
number of candidates,’ said Steve
Abraham, one of two students seeking
election as student body president. ‘‘I was
looking forward to a competitive race.”

Abraham has served on the Executive
Committee for two years and now seeks
victory as one of the student government’s
“Big Three.’’ The election is March 12.

Apathy

“To a large degree, it’s apathy,” said
Abraham referring to the lack of student
involvement in elections. ‘“‘They just aren’t
that interested.”’

“IT think it’s forgetfulness as well as
apathy. One of my goals is to try and get
more students involved. The publicity
could have been better also,” said
Abraham.

Honor

“There is a gross lack of understanding
about honor code procedures,” said
Abraham. ‘‘People just don’t understand
how it works.”

‘“‘The honor code is what you make it,”’
he adds. “It’s one of the strongest in the
country. It doesn’t take too many bad ap-
ples though to discredit the system,” he
continued.

On whether Washington and Lee
gentlemen are responsible to the honor
code while intoxicated, Abraham said that
“it would depend on the particular situa-
tion.”

“TI could understand some situations
where the guy couldn’t be held accoun-
table for anything but I don’t think
students should use drugs or alcohol as a
scapegoat for their actions,’ Abraham
stated. ‘‘I see this as an issue that could be
spelled out more clearly by the E.C. to the
student body.”

“A student represents Washington and
Lee in the surrounding community and
should act as a_ gentleman,’ said
Abraham.

A felony is viewed as unacceptable by
that community. Grand larceny is viewed
as bad in both communities but ‘‘mari-
juana is viewed more toleratnly in a col-
lege society than elsewhere.”’

“IT think the question should have been
addressed to the E.C.”’ added Abraham.

Grade Review

“The issue of grade review is a perfect
example of student apathy,’ states
Abraham. “If people were a lot more
outspoken or demonstrated more of a need
to do something,” he adds, something
might have been accomplished.

“I think the comaraderie of the faculty
limits its success,’ said Abraham. “It
would be very hard for a grade review pro-
gram at Washington and Lee. It is becom-
ing more of an issue,”’ he continues, ‘‘but I
think a true need for grade review should
be shown.”

Admissions

“T have talked to a few people up in the
office,’’ said Abraham while speaking
about student involvement in admissions.

“Hartog is doing a lot of positive things

. to upgrade the recruitment process, I

think it’s something the school desperately
needs,” he adds. ‘‘At the same time I see
recruitment straying away from the stu-
dent body.’’

“You can get the academics almost
anywhere if you apply yourself. A big plus
of the school is. the friends you have and
the people you meet,’’ he said. “I think
visitors notice that.”

More E.C. Reps

“T definitely have done a lot of thinking
on that,’’ said Abraham while speaking on
law school and freshman representatives.
“It’s something that is talked about almost
every year.”’

“] think if you look at the history of law
students on the committee,” Abraham
said, “‘only two or three have fulfilled their
whole terms. It has been disruptive to the
EC.”

‘“‘There’s a learning process involved,”
Abraham continued. “‘You must be aware
of all procedures in order to do a good
job.”’

“If the law school is about 300, I think
two representatives adequately represent
their views,’’ he said.

Freshmen are encountering Washington
and Lee’s honor code, probably for the
first time, said Abraham.

“They miss committee appointments
and the general tone-setting period for the
committee which comes in the spring,’’ he
said.

“There is a period of assimilation for the
whole freshman class and I don’t think two
freshman representatives would alter the
situation or benefit the system.”’

EC Funding of
Varsity Sports

“The only time when it should be done is
when it is a loan with a time stipulation,”
said Abraham referring to E.C. funding of
varsity sports.

“T would be against it in the future,”’ he
added, ‘‘because it could be used as an
argument later. People could point to that
loan this year and say a precedent was
set.”

Only when “all other avenues for
revenue have been exhausted,’’ should an
organization request funds from the E.C.
“A raffle could have been held,’’ adds
Abraham. Two students could have been
picked to go to Florida with the team.

Fraternities

Speaking on noise and fraternities
Abraham said that “I think from the
beginning of the year there has been an ef-
fort on the part of fraternities to behave
themselves and realize their respon-
sibilities.”

“The city forced the issue in a bad way
by enforcing it (Lexington’s noise or-
dinance). It could have been handled in a
better way,”’ he added.

“The city and the fraternities should get
together and straighten this out. I can see
the role of the E.C. president involved in
this situation,” Abraham said.

Coeducation

“What do I think about coeducation?”
asks Abraham. ‘‘Well I think logistically,
the cost of transforming this campus so it
could ideally house women and men at the
same time might be fairly expensive.”

“T think it is something the school should
seriously look into. The real need of
women here is for the academic
pressures.”’

‘“‘Washington and Lee has a strong tradi-
tion — very few all-male colleges are left
in the country. I think a lot of alumni enjoy
that reputation. I would hate to see the
academic standing of the school drop,” he
said.

Abraham ended his interview by stress-
ing one point he thought needed mention-
ing.

“IT have always been an advocate of
opening meetings in students government.

We should be accessible and accountable
to the students always,” he added.

“The student body should be aware
when all student meetings are held. What
we need is more involvement.”’

Abraham was interviewed by Ring-tum Phi
staff writer Joe Scott.

 

Christopher
Burnham

Christopher Burnham is the write-in
candidate for student body president who
joined the race late Tuesday.

Burnham, a junior, is a transfer student
from the University of Connecticut, where
he studied for two years before working
last year on Capital Hill.

His qualifications for the office of presi-
dent are that he was president of the Con-
necticut University Assembly for two
years.

“In this assembly, we _ practiced
Parliamentary debate and I had first-
hand experience with Roberts Rules of
Order, which I have a firm command of,”
he said.

“Additionally, this fall I was appointed
Liberal Party Leader of the W&L
Parliamentary Union in an attempt to br-
ing a Parliamentary Union to W&L.”’ He
feels that his experience in Congress has
given him a ‘good feeling for Parliamen-
tary procedure.”

“My experience with W&L is limited to
the time I have been here, but I don’t
think that would be a hindrance to my be-
ing a conscientious president,’ Burnham
said.

He said that as an independent, he could
adaquately represent both independents
and fraternity members.

“TI have a number of friends in frater-
nities and I once considered joining a
fraternity,’’ he said of his abilities to
represent fraternity members.

Fraternity Problems

“T’m as familiar with the fraternity
system as any fraternity member,” Bur-
nham said.

“The town of Lexington owes a great
deal to Washington and Lee and it’s time
for them to realize our existence as
members of the community.

“The fraternities have done all the ben-
ding and the town has remained stead-

fast. It’s time for the administration to ex- .

ert more pressure on the town.

“I would lead a concerted effort to peti-
tion the administration with all the frater-
nities to act on their behalf to enjoin the
City Council’ to relax the noise or-
dinance, he said.

He wants to get all fraternity members
to lobby the faculty and the administra-
tion to exert pressure on the town about
fraternity noise problems.

Honor

“It is my understanding that W&L has
the most workable honor code in the coun-
try. Are we ineffective because a half
dozen students must leave each fall?

“I’m worried about the increase in
thefts on campus. There has to be an ef-
fort on the part of the students to under-
take the responsibility of seeing the honor
code implemented. There can be no
lassez-faire attitude” (regarding the
honor code).

“Some will say that the honor code
stops at the W&L property line. I
disagree. The honor code applies
throughout the private community of Lex-
ington.

“‘When you leave this campus, you go
out as a representative of the school, and
your actions, good or bad, will reflect on
the school. You must always remember
you commitment to the honor code,” Bur-
nham said.

“‘Insobriety is no excuse (for breaching
the honor code),”’ he said.

Grade Review

“The faculty has rejected the last (stu-
dent) EC proposal for a five-member
faculty grade review board.”” Burnham
feels that a process through which the stu-
dent tries to resolve his grade dispute
with the department head and his own ad-
visor may be more acceptable to the
faculty.

“Again, the faculty must bend with us
and meet us. They must compromise here
as we are doing,” he said.

EC Funding of
Varsity Sports

“T was pleased that the Executive Com-
mittee could act in the capacity of loaning
the lacrosse team the necessary funds for
its trip to Florida. I am not in favor of con-
tinual loans or grants by the EC to the
athletic program.

“T think in this case, though, it was a
very noble gesture, a gesture well taken,
and in this one case, a solid decision. This
year’s case was a special exception,”’
Burnham said.

“TI do not feel it was precedent setting
and I do not foresee other teams coming
to the EC for funds. It’s just not the proper
avenue for grants. If the lacrosse team
comes again next year, I would be wary of
giving it funds,”’ he said.

Coeducation

“Tam more worried about our commit-
ment to a high standard of excellence in
our students than this question of
coeducation,”’ Burnham said.

He feels that with the general decline in
the number of college students in the
country, W&L may either have to lower
adminissions standards or admit women
to keep up enrollment.

. “Tradition must not stand in the way of
academic excellence,” he said.

More EC Reps

Burnham is in favor of the freshman
class having two EC representatives and
the law school having three.

“Freshmen are as much a part of the
community as anyone else. They are not
second-class citizens.

“I feel strongly that the law school
should have three (representatives on the
EC). How can you deny an entire class
representation?”’ he asked.

Burnham would also like to give in-
dependents “‘a place to go.” He would like
to see the development office made into a
social house for students not in frater-
nities.

Such an action would lessen the
“animosity between fraternity members
and independents,’’ Burnham said.
Burnham was interviewed by Ring-tum Phi
staff writer Randy Smith.

 

 
Cotter Unopposed For Vice President

Les Cotter, junior class presi-
dent, is running unopposed for
vice-president of the student
body. He calls the situation of
running unopposed unfortunate,
and says he looks at that aspect

of the election with ‘mixed
emotions’’.
Cotter said that he was

especially disturbed by there
being no candidates for
secretary, saying, ‘“You really
need someone who’s capable or
the rest of the committee won’t
click.”’
’ He attributed the lack of
registered candidates not to
apathy as much as to the idea
that “people just don’t think
they can bea part of it.”’
Honor

When asked whether a Honor

student found guilty of a felony

in a court of law is also guilty of
a breach of the honor code, Cot-
ter said that each case should
be considered individually.’

Cotter said that he did not
know enough about the recent
case of a student being found
guilty of a felony on drug
charges to pass judgement on
that case.

Cotter did say that he felt the
honor code at Washington and
lee is very strong and he plans
to keep the honor system ‘‘fully
intact.”

“There are certain gray
areas that perhaps the orienta-
tion program could clear up,”’
he said. He feels that there is
some problem with applying the
honor system to ‘“‘small viola-
tions”. “Students have to take
the initative to enforce the

University Council
discusses grade review

The University Council met

last week to discuss the latest
suggested changes in the pro-
posed grade review plan but
failed to make any endorsement
of the change.
' The faculty’s major com-
plaint stemmed from their feel-
ing that there is no real need for
a grade review plan, and
especially one that would create
a Standing committee.

Dr. Gary H. Dobbs said that
there would be: potential for
abuse of students, but that does
not mean that there is abuse. He
said, ‘‘Let those who have been
abused stand up.”’

Neal Brickman, second year
law representative, asked how
the EC can demonstrate that
there is a problem with grading.

He offered to create a ‘“‘search
committee”’ to find some cases
where students feel they have
been treated unfairly.

Professor Larry Boetsch
said, ‘“There is a proceedure for
appealing a grade, and that is to
go to the professor involved.”’

Dean Edward C. Atwood said
that last semester 29 grades
were changed for students.

Dean of Students Lewis John
said there is ‘considerable
faculty sentiment that the pre-
sent system is adequate.”

The council closed the
meeting, taking no action
regarding the proposal to
create a grade review commit-
tee. Earlier word changes,
iy will go before the facul-

honor system,’’ he said.

‘Each student has to be on
guard against violations, keep
his eyes and ears open,” he
said. ‘‘The only way to do this is
for each student to keep in mind
his duties under a system of
honor.”’

As for students being respon-
sible for the honor code when in-
toxicated, Cotter said, ‘‘You’re
still responsible for your ac-
tions; you’re still the same per-
son.”

Cotter feels the honor system
here is unique and “‘not even
like the real world.”’

EC Funding Of
Varsity Sports

Cotter does not believe in
blanket EC funding of varsity
sports. Each case must be con-
sidered individually, he says.

“If an athletic team was so
desperate that it would have to
ask the EC for money, the EC
should take a good hard look at
the case before just giving out
the money.”

Grade Review

As for the grade review, Cot-
ter says he doesn’t know if the
present grade review policy is
even necessary.

“You always have com-
plaints,” he said, “I wonder
how legitimate the complaints
are.”

“T can see both sides,

- though,” he said, ‘I think the

EC has made the right deci-
sion.”
Fraternities

Cotter, a fraternity member,
is concerned about fraternity
relations with the town. He sees
a problem in that ‘‘fraternities
and townspeople are trying to
live together, and their
lifestyles are not the same.’

He says there are problems
with the noise ordinance in that

once a fraternity is presented
with a summons it has no
recourse.

“It is obvious from all the

summons that have _ been
issued, the fraternities are not
living harmoniously with the
townspeople, ‘‘Cotter said.
However, he said he was pleas-
ed with the small number of
summons issued recently.
Running On His Record

Cotter says he really isn’t
running on any particular plat-
form as he has no opposition
that has challenged him on any
issues.

“I’m running on my record,”
he said, ‘The vice-president’s
two main duties are to perform

 

the functions of the president in
his absence and be in charge of
dispersement of money to stu-
dent body agencies.”

Cotter says he has taken ac-
counting courses and has serv-
ed as president of both his
sophomore and junior classes.
He says he tries to keep up with
EC proceedings and reads the
EC minutes.

Cotter says he doesn’t agree
with closing meetings just to
keep information away from
students. ‘‘If the students might
benefit from open meetings
they should be open,”’ he said.

Cotter was interviewed by Ring-
tum Phistaff writer David Greer.

Lord of the Rings

An Animated Controversy

by Dick Barron

Ralph Bakshi is America’s
whiz-kid animator. Some say he
took over where Disney left off.
His film career got its break
with Fritz the Cat, the first X-
rated animated film to be
distributed by Hollywood. He
later went on to produce two
relatively unsuccessful films,
Heavy Traffic and Coonskin.
Then Twentieth Century-Fox
picked up Bakshi’s Wizards,
which established him as a
popular success.

Bakshi’s innovative techni-
ques have at once added
creative sparks to the anima-
tion industry and provided con-

troversial subjects for the
critics. His latest film, The Lord
of the Rings, is typical Bakshi
on an inflated scale.

J.R.R. Tolkien's classic Lord
of the Rings, trilogy has been
approached and avoided by
many animators, including
Walt Disney, who found the
story too complex for easy
translation into film. Bakshi
eventually took on the project
and the result is an important,
but fully chaotic film.

Bakshi’s major innovation
this time was that he shot the
entire movie with live actors
before actually animating the
scen scenes. The animation was

Let’s Do It Againstarring: Bill Cosby, Sidney Poitier, Denise
Nichols, Lee Chamberlain; directed by Sidney Poitier.

It’s another bout of comedy for Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier as
they return from UPTOWN SATURDAY NIGHT. J.J. Walker, from
T.V.’s Good Times plays Bootner Farnsworth who has punchlines
that'll break ribs, but no more boxing jab than a gnat. The hilarious
action begins when he’s set up in a title boxing match and bets are
laid with mobsters. There's plenty of fancy footwork and a contest
of wits and hilarity that leave you counting to ten and laughing
“LET’S DO IT AGAIN!!" Rated: PG. Showtimes: Friday, Satur-
day 7:00 p.m. & 9:00 p.m., Sunday: 2:00 p.m., 7:00 p.m., and 9:00
p.m.

The Night of the Living Dead

For ten years, The Night of the Living Dead has been terrorizing
its willing victims at midnight showings with visions of can-
nibalism and carnage, its army of resurrected corpses creeping
across the screen in search of human flesh. Made in 1968 and
almost unnoticed, the film sank into the flickering world of the
underground, where it took root like a mutated mushroom. In
theaters from Tokyo to Paris to Madrid to New York it began play-
ing, often in special performances after the last regular feature,
until it beeame a bona fide cult movie for a burgeoning band of
blood-lusting cinema buffs.

What gives the film its special chill is the banality of the enemy.
The monster here is not some giant order of coleslaw gone mad, but
average citizens turned malevolent. And when the army of com-
mon folk gets its victims, the camera, far from shying away, zooms
in for details of the depraved consuming a handful of intestine,
devouring a heart, licking ona lung.

(In addition, the film contains one of this editor's favorite
cinematic scenes, an interview with a dim-witted sheriff. To such
questions as ‘‘How do you kill them?" he answers ‘‘Beat ‘em or
burn 'em — kill the brain, kill the ghoul -- they don't move real
quick; they're dead you know.”’)

RATED: R (Original, uncut version).

Eye And Car:

then drawn from these live
shots, giving the film = an
unusual life-like quality.
However, the effect in many
places was one of simply tinted,
or off-color live action intruding
into the animation and ruining
any sense of consistency.

The live action animation pro-
cess has been used in other
Bakshi films, namely Wizards,
with virtually the same messy
effect. Regardless of the
splashy visuals one might get
from this technique, it seems as
if Bakshi is cheating when he
calls it animation all the time.

For example, there is one
scene, a battle, which looks as if
Bakshi took an old adventure
film and added a psychedelic
tint to it— its very similar to the
effect one gets when he tempers
with the controls on a color T.V.
set — Walter Cronkite gets a
purple face.

Real Animation

Flip remarks aside, there is a
solid content of ‘‘real’’ anima-
tion in the film. Especially ap-
pealing was the Gollum
character—the green, slimy
creature who begs for “my
precious” ring.

The animation is not nearly so
annoying as the screenplay.
The muddy, complex scripting
seems to suffocate the action of
the film. Granted, The Lord of
the Rings is a complicated story
even for avid readers of
Tolkien. The point is that
writers Chris Conkling and
Peter S. Beagle were not
careful enough in shaping a
lucid script — they obviously
assumed the audience was fully
aware of the storyline.

This coupled with the fact
that many of the characters
resembled one another visually,
was cause for much confusion.
There may not be a solution for
this problem, still, one wonders
why it went wrong. There was
certainly enough space for the
telling of the story, as the film
ran a hefty two hours and
eleven minutes.

We have seen Ralph Bakshi's

Edvard Munch

by Carren O. Kaston

The Washington and Lee
University Film Society will
present Peter Watkins’ Edvard
Munch on Friday and Saturday,
March 9th and 10th. Showings
will take place in classroom
“C”™ of the Law School at 8 p.m.
Admission is free.

Watkins’ magnificent 1976
color film is based on the life of
Edvard Munch, the Norwegian
painter who is now considered
one of the seminal figures of
modern art, the founder, with
Van Gogh, of the Expressionist
movement in painting.

Scorn and Controversy

The movie shows the scorn
and controversy which greeted
Munch's work at the end of the
19th century, and the emotional,
sexual, and artistic tensions he
himself suffered in achieving
his breakthrough. Similarly,
the movie itself breaks through
our expectations about the
limits of cinema by weaving
together biography,
psychology, history, sociology,
pictorial analysis, and fictional
interviews in a daring canvas of
Munch's life, art, and times.

Consumption

Consumption was the major
dread disease of the 19th cen-
tury, the way that cancer is the
dread disease of our own time.
Because tuberculosis has now
been virtually eradicated, we
cannot quite grasp its terrors
even though we know that many
famous people and many
characters we have read about

in literature were among its vic-
tims.

By making frighteningly real
what it was like to die of con-
sumption, the movie further
helps us to understand what life
was like at the end of the last
century.

tnguish and Anxiety

Munch’s paintings, especially
“The Scream,” express the
isolation, anguish, and anxiety
which characterize the way in
which 20th century man very
largely thinks of himself. In the
tradition of New Wave film-
making, the movie makes use of
a-chronological time — se-
quences, time sequences whose
order is fractured and associa-
tional rather than rational and
normatively continuous, to sug-
gest Munch's tormented inner
state as he engaged in. the
creative process.

Living Was Torture

What we get is a picture of a
man for-whom living in the pre-
sent was torture. Unable to con-
trol his associations, Munch is
constantly retreating from ob-
jective reality, from the situa-
tions which his body occupies,
into a mental world which is ut-
terly dominated by his past. He
is the quintessential modern
man: trapped inside of his own
head.

Next in the Film Society's
series will be Orson Welles’
Falstaff, which is based on
Shakespeare's Henry IV adn V
plays. It is scheduled for Friday
and Saturday, March 30 and 31.

Concert Guild Presents:
Stradivari String Concert

The Stradivari String
Quartet, the noted chamber
music ensemble currently in
residence at the University of
Iowa, will present a concert of
works by Haydn, Shostakovich,
and Schuman next Tuesday,

March 13. The concert will
begin at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel,
and is sponsored by the
Washington and Lee Concert
Guild.

Michael Franks
Tiger in the Rain
Warner Brothers BSK 3294

Michael Franks is one of
those people, in the grand tradi-
tion of Melanie and the Grateful
Dead, who seem to inspire
either undying love or pas-
sionate hatred in their listeners.
I can recall-sitting around with
a group of friends when ‘‘Popsi-
cle Toes’’, a minor novelty hit of
his from a few years back,
came on the radio.

Half of the folks present went
out for a beer run, claiming
they ‘“‘couldn’t take it any
longer,’’ while the rest found
themselves totally captivated
by Franks’ intriquing lyrics and
unique vocal mannerisms.

Well, I must admit, I was one
of the ones who left, but Tiger
in the Rain, Franks’ latest
release on Warner Bros., has
got me firmly under it’s spell.
Franks’ approach is very dif-
ficult to describe; if you can im-
agine Roberta Flack singing
slightly off-key in front of an
airy, almost tropical-sounding
jazz-based ensemble, with a
kinky lyricist thrown in to boot,
then you might have some idea
of just how original his sound is.

Unfortunately, despite all this
originality, Tiger in the Rain
presents one crucial problem;
in many places, it’s hard to tell
whether the record’s appeal
comes from Franks’ singing
and songwriting or from John
Simon’s superb arrangements.

Lifeline

“Lifeline” is a case in point;
one of the album’s weaker
songwriting efforts, it is also
one of its most enjoyable
moments, due mostly to Lou
Soloff’s delightful overdubbed
trumpet duet. Little things like
that keep popping up
throughout the record, doing
much to detract from Franks’
singular talents.

However, the fact remains

that Tiger in the Rain is a rare
commodity, that dreamy, laid-
back, rainy Saturday afternoon
record that you’d only listen to
once or twice a year, but that
sounds surprisingly perfect
whenever you do dig it out. Wait
a second, didn’t they used to

call this mood music???

A Photographic Study
Called “Social Realism”

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s fine arts department will
sponsor a lecture and reception
Friday, March 9, at 8 p.m. in du-
Pont Hall.

Matthew Baigell, professor of
art history at Rutgers Universi-
ty, will deliver the lecture, en-
titled ‘‘Social Realism,’’ which
will take place in conjunction
with an_ exhibition of
photographs by Jacob Riis and
Lewis Hine in duPont Gallery
through March 23.

Baigell, who received his
master’s degree from Columbia
University and his Ph.D. from
the University of Pennsylvania,
is the 1977 recipient of Rutgers
University’s faculty merit
award.

He has written a number of
books and articles on American
painting and is currently com-
pleting a dictionary of
American art.

The reception will take place
in duPont Gallery following the

lecture program.

The gallery exhibition will in-
clude photographs of slum life
in New York City, taken by Riis
in the late 1800s, together with
photographs of child labor
abuses taken by Hine between
1908 and 1917 for the National
Child Labor Committee, ac-
cording to Pamela H.’ Simpson,

material to the screen. But
maybe Lord of the Rings is one
of those stories which will never
fully translate to film because it
possesses so many complicated

only hope that Bakshi will

Generals Stun

Duke, 13-8 In B.V.

by Doug Linton
and Bill Whalen

If you were one of the
multitude that believed the E.C.
grant to the lacrosse team was
for naught, then now is the time
for you to eat your crow. The
Generals, looking impressive
for the second straight time,
rolled to a 13-8 victory over
Duke, yesterday in a game
played at Buena Vista.

The Generals’ second win of
the season was particularly
dramatic because it avenged
last year’s 12-10 loss in Durham.
“Having the field time (in
Florida) made the difference,”’
said coach Jack Emmer. ‘‘Duke
has as good a team as they had
last year, we’re just better.”

In the opening period,
however, this could not be said.
The Generals fell behind 2-0 un-
til goals by Sandy McDonald
and John Hooper left W&L trail-
ing 3-2 at the end of the period.

The second period belonged tu
the Generals. McDonald, John
Black and John Kemp each
scored once to build a 5-3 lead
by the halfway mark of the
game. Equally important was
the play of Devils in the entire
quarter.

After those three goals, the
Generals seemed to had lost
any early shakiness and settled
down to play their own style of
dominant forechecking. Geoff
Brent scored to make it 6-4.
Duke came back to score less
than two minutes later, but
Black netted his second goal of
the day with 9:20 left in the
period. Then Black’s All-
American teammate Jeff Fritz
scored less than thirty seconds

later to stun Duke. Another goal
by Black and one by middie
George Santos put W&L in an
insurmountable advantage at
11-6.

The two teams played evenly
in the fourth quarter as Hooper
scored his second goal and
Black added his fourth to close
out the scoring at 13-8, in favor
of Washington and Lee.

Overall, Black had four goals
while Fritz was limited to only
one goal but added four assists
to give him five points for the
day and 11 total points in only
two games. Likewise, Clements
had another outstanding game,
limiting the opponent to only
eight goals for the second
straight time.

Future Looks Bright
For Fencing Team

by Bill Sherwin

In what was unquestionably
their finest performance of the
year, Washington and Lee’s fen-
cing club thoroughly trounced
the Citadel’s varsity fencing
team by a score of 20-7. It was
the crowning achievement in
what has been a tremedous
year for the fencing squad.

In what was termed by coach
Dr. James Worth as their finest
performance of the year, the
sabre team, led by David
Garner and Bill Hill, shut out
Citadel by a score of 9-0. Both
Garner and Hill were
undefeated, winning all three of
their bouts. Fletcher
Harkrader, a first year fencer,
won both his bouts, and Dave
Bryant, in spite of a case of
asthma, won to complete an im-
pressive performance by the
sabremen.

In epee’, W&L won by a score
of 7-2, in spite of illness suffered
by squad leader Rob Earle, who

was unable to fence. The win- -

ners in epee were Bill Sherwin,
3-0, Dave Hepler, 2-1, and Paul
Nathan, who was also 2-1.

In foil, W&L dropped to the
Citadel by the score of 5-4.
Freshmen Steve King and Colt
Puryear went 1-1.

Team Captain Will Mackie

and sophomore John Stathakis
both went 1-1 on the afternoon.

Dr. Worth attributed the
tough foil competition to the
heavy substitution he made in
order to give some of the more
inexperienced fencers a chance
to fence. He had high praise for
the fencing team, which began
practice at the beginning of the
year and managed a_ 3-3-1
record in its first year of inter-
collegiate competition.

‘The team has really come a
long way this year. I am ex-
tremely pelased with the
dedication to the sport of fenc-
ing which they have shown
me.’’ Worth went on to praise
the team for fencing on difficult
weekends and over vacation,
pointing out that their sacrifice

was for a sport with only club
status.

‘This year the team posted vic-
tories over James Madison,
VMI, and the Citadel, while it
dropped two meets to UVa., and
one to Navy. Ina fencing exhibi-
tion match against James
Madison later in the year, the
team recorded a draw against
JMu, when only ' of the other
squad’s fencers showed up.

With the intercollegiate fenc-
ing season now at an end, the
fencers will now begin competi-
tion in local tournaments spon-
sored by the American Fencing
League of America. With the
valuable experience gained this
year and with the development
of its new talent, the fencing
squad is looking forward to an
impressive year next season.

Lax Team Wins First
Over Chesapeake

The Generals got off to a good
start this season by smacking
the Chesapeake Lacrosse Club
by a score of 12-8. Due to poor
conditions at Wilson Field the
game was played at Glen
Maury Park in Buena Vista, but

nonetheless a fair crowd still
gathered to watch the game on
Saturday.

Washington and Lee jumped
to a quick lead, as they scored
the only four goals in the first
quarter. Chesapeake inched as
close as 5-3 by the middle of the
second, but the Generals led 6-3
at the half. From that point on,
Chesapeake never got any
closer than three, with the
Generals leading by as many as
five goals at three times during
the second half. The fourth
quarter proved to be the most
exciting and evenly matched,
with each team scoring four
times.

“We were very pleased,”
stated Coach Emmer. ‘We
were glad to win against a good
team this early in the season.”
But although the team is about
two weeks ahead of where it
would have been without the
Florida trip, Emmer and some
of his players felt that the of-
fense didn’t quite ‘‘flow.’’ Ap-
parently the team had better
executed its offensive tactics in
practice.

Both Emmer and the squad
are very optimistic. ‘‘I’m.sure it
can be better, and when we get
it there, I’m sure we’ll be a
much better team than we were
on Saturday,” said Emmer.

Saturday’s contest was only
an exhibition, but that fact
didn’t keep the Generals from
going all out. The tri-captains
led the scoring, in their usual
Style. Jeff Fritz had 3 goals and
3 assists to head the pack. John
Black also netted 3, and Sandy
McDonald wasn’t far behind
with his 2 goals and 1 assist.
Mike Pressler, John Kemp, Art
Caltrider, and Joe Olive all add-
ed single tallies, with Jim
Herbert, Geoff Brent, and John
Hooper each having an assist.

Goalkeeper Bob Clements
was simply superb; very few
stoppers ever look so sharp this
early in the season. He had 20
saves and allowed only 8 goals.
His consistent defense and
positive attitude could be a key
factor in the team’s success this
spring.

Rodgers Wrestles
In Div. IIT Tourney

Wrestling co-captain Ed
Rodgers, a senior from Mt.
Ephraim, N.J., was Washington
and Lee’s only participant in
the NCAA Division III National
Championships last weekend in
Arcata, California. Rodgers,
who was accompanied on the
trip by wrestling coach Gary
Franke, was defeated in the
first round by his Brockport
(N.Y.) State opponent.

Rodgers, who was named the
1978 ODAC Wrestler of the Year
and was also an all-conference
wrestler for the second con
secutive year, completed the

   
   
  

season with a 16-15-1 record. His
four-year mark at W&L now
stands at 54-27-3.

   

by Bill Whalen

Were the 1978-79 basketball
Generals a success or a failure?
It depends on whose standards
you follow. If you believe that a
winning Season means finishing
over .500, then this year was a
success. However, if you com-
pare this year’s record to those
of the past three seasons, then
the Generals’ combination of 17
wins and 10 losses was below
average. The likely answer is
that W&L’s season was a com-
bination of good and bad, with
neither prevailing.

In reviewing this season,
there were three key stages that
would determine how the team
would progress. The first mo-
ment came when the Generals
were 3-2. Having already lost
two ODAC games and facing a
four game road trip, W&L was
in an early hole. The second
time of crisis came when the
Generals were 8-5. At this time.
W&L had lost its third straight
ODAC game and_= second
straight loss following a 5-1 win-
ning streak. The third impor-
tant stage had to be when the
Generals were 16-7. W&L was
playing its best basketball otf
the season, had won seven
straight ODAC games to tie tor
second place and, with all the
players healthy, had a good
chance at winning the upcom
ing ODAC Tournament. Again
the Generals went on a four
game road trip but found op-
posite results from before by
losing three out of four to finish
witha 17-10 record.

If you like to second-guess
teams, then this group provides
many opportunities. For exam-
ple, what if Dave Leunig had
been healthy all season long?
Granted, Leunig did play in 21
games, but only in half of those
games did he play on two sound
knees. What if the Generals had
one steady lineup for the entire
season”? By the time W&L
Coach Verne Canfield found the
right combination, the season
was already 13 games through.
What if Ardie Collins had not
missed the final Lynchburg
game”? W&L might very well be
in the NCAA Tournament at this
time. And finally, what if the
Generals had won every game
they lost by six points or less?
Instead of being 17-10, . they
would be 22-5 and would have

tied with Hampden-Sydney for
the regular season title.

Of the thirteen members of
this squad, only four will not be
back. Captain Mike Wenke, this
year’s point guard, will be
replaced by junior Pete Farrell
and freshman George Spears
The other three seniors — Col-
lins, Leunig and Jim Berlin
leave the Generals with a lack
of height. Filling this void will
be sophomore Rob Smither
man, who needs to add twenty
pounds and a shooting touch,
and freshman Travis Patter-
son, who possesses good touch
and jumping ability, but needs
more playing time. Elsewhere.

Carby Hoy will return to his
shooting guard position. junior
Tom Jeffries and freshman
Clark New will handle the
forward-wing © position, while
sophomore R. J. Scaggs. the
team's most underfated player,
will contribute his steady re
bounding at the other forward
position

With H-SC and Lynchburg
returning their premier stars
and the arrival of Roanoke from
Division II basketball, in which
they have been ranked as high
as second nationally, next
year’s ODAC race promises to
be the toughest ever for
Washington and Lee.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK ‘TI!

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Ill tidings...

It’s difficult to recall any recent event at W&L more
discouraging than the turn-out of candidates for Mon-
day’s “Big Three’’ elections. With only one official
candidate for both president and vice-president, and
none at all for secretary, the political field is the
smallest in recent memory. And judging by the
general lack of campus enthusiasm, it appears that
voter participation may also hit an all-time low point.

Student apathy is hardly a new arrival to this cam-
pus. Looking back, there have been more than a few
major examples this year alone. Voter turn-out was
under 30% in both the freshman and sophomore elec-
tions this year. Student interest in the EC’s grade
review plan has waned, causing that project to
flounder. After a brief spark of interest, the In-
dependents’ Union is again silent. The Muscular
Dystrophy Dance Marathon reports that few students
have opted to give their time, though some weeks re-
main to make the affair a success. And worst of all,
the power and position of our fraternity system con-

tinues to deteriorate, despite valiant efforts by IFC of-

ficials.

Can this be the same university which mobilized
over 1,500 people to move library books on a day
without classes? The same campus which has an EC
noted this year for fairness and efficiency? The same
place where SAB members work around the clock for
Fancy Dress, and publications currently enjoy a
tremendous rise in size and quality? Hard to believe...

Strangely enough, the high ievel of responsibility
seen on campus this year is probably the main reason
for our latest outbreak of apathy. Controversy and in-
efficiency seem to be the only things that awaken the
student body — and by then it’s often too late for
repair. We admit that this year’s EC is going to be a
tough act to follow — but their success should inspire
others to get involved, not lull the student body into a
state of inertia. It is the duty of the students to carry
on the achievements of the current year. So, we en-
courage others to join Messrs. Abraham and Cotter in
the race as write-in candidates. Make your presence
known! Only in this way can we be assured of pro-
gress in the year ahead.

Letters To The

 

 

 

Fancy Dress pack-rats warned

Fellow Students:

The Fancy Dress Ball was a fun time for all
of us here at W&L, especially for those of us
on the SAB who saw our months of planning
and hard work fall into place last Friday
night. The decorations for the student center
required enormous amounts of creative
talent, patience, and money to assemble and
only a few short moments to disassemble
when the ball ended.

Some of the decorations were meant to be
taken as souveniers: posters, stickers, signs
— all the way to glittered trees and lamp-
posts. Other decorations, however, were not.
Specifically, the SAB would like returned im-
mediately the glittered man-in-the-moon and
his spoon (taken from “Studio 54’’) and the
two “‘I Love NY” sign boards (removed from
above the two entrances to the dining hall).
No questions will be asked if these are return-
ed to the SAB office within the week. If they
are not, their removal may become a matter
for the Executive Committee.

We thank the members of the student body
for their help in recovering these decorations.

Sincerely,
Douglas Jackson

Dear Editor:

I have just finished reading the first ten
issues of this year’s Ring-tum Phi. I knew that
W&L would change during my year abroad,
but I never thought that what was known as
the Rag-tam Pon in past years could be
transformed into such an_ enjoyable
newspaper. Not only do the articles appear
unbiasde; they’re interesting. The old Phi has
even made me feel nostalgia for W & L. That’s
an accomplishment in itself. Keep up the
great work Gray, et al. As we say here in

Independents’ study

A study is underway to deter-
mine whether Washington and
Lee should provide services for
non-fraternity students above
and beyond the services
already being offered. The
study is being conducted by a
committee composed of frater-
nity and independent students,
and members of the faculty. A
questionnaire has recently been
mailed to all independent
students to generate informa-
tion which can be used by the

committee in formulating
results. Students are urged to
complete their questionnaire
and return them to the Univer-
sity Center or place them in the
container in the Bookstore. The
committee needs this informa-
tion and earnestly requests all
students to return their ques-
tionnaire as soon as possible.

In Memoriam

Dr. E.S. Gilreath

Professor of Chemistry

Esmarch Senn Gilreath, head
of the chemistry department at
Washington and Lee University
for 15 years until 1970 and a
member of the W&L faculty for
29 years, died at his home
Saturday evening. He was 74.

He is survived by his wife,
Sara Taylor Gilreath.

Prof. Gilreath was born Sept.
21, 1904, in North Wilkesboro,
N.C. He earned his A.B., M.A.
and Ph.D. degrees in chemistry
from the University of North
Carolina, where he also taught
while working on his doctorate.
He spent a year as a research
chemist for American Enka
Corp. before joining the W&L
chemistry faculty in 1946. He
became department head in
1955 and returned to full-time
teaching in 1970. He retired in
1975.

He was the author of a
number of college-level
chemistry textbooks, including
‘‘Elementary Qualitative
Analysis’’ (1969), ‘“Experimen-

Police Towed 14 Cars, Issued 62 Parking Tickets

by David Greer

Fancy Dress went smoothly
this year for almost everyone
concerned — the Student Ac-
tivities Board, the workers in
the Cockpit, and the revelers
who celebrated the event for the
entire weekend and most of last
week,

The real judgment comes
from those who had to come
face to face with any problems,
the ones who saw them all — the
Lexington Police Force.

The police’s judgment seems
to coincide with that of the
revelers — that everything
went very smoothly.

The main trouble the police
had was with traffic problems.
The police issued 44 tickets for
parking in restricted zones.

The Lexington police towed
nine illegally parked cars over
the weekend, but none were
towed Friday night during the
Fancy Dress Ball.

The State police were busy
towing cars, though, on Satur-
day afternoon at Zollman’s
pavillion.

Trooper W. J. Whitt said that
18 tickets were issued at the
pavillion. Five cars were towed
all the way to the station, and
several more were hooked to
the wrecker when claimed by
the owners.

Whitt said that residents com-
plain when cars are parked
along the road at the pavillion
every time there is a big party.
He said that there are no park-
ing signs out there, but they are
often stolen.

Lexington Police Officer Paul
A. Smothers called it ‘‘a real
good weekend’’ and said that
aside from the traffic, ‘“‘not too
much was out of hand.”

Smothers said people just
don’t seem to care where they
park at the parties, and find
their car ticketed or towed.

Lexington Police Chief James
A. Kirby said that the weekend
wasn’t too bad, either. He
assigned extra men to work
both nights, though.

Normally he has three men
work the night shifts. This

weekend, he had seven men
working from 8 p.m. to4a.m.

Kirby said that there were
some problems with larcenies
this weekend. He said that a
pocketbook was stolen at the
Ball, and some items were
taken from the dorms last
week.

Kirby said that the students
were good about working with
the police, especially when ask-
ed to turn down music.

There were 51 complaints to
police during the weekend,
most about parking or noise,
Kirby said.

Officer Wayne Rhodenizer

said that the weekend was a lit-

_tle hectic, but “‘more organized
than just a party weekend.”’ He
pointed out that the police
issued 16 noise permits, when
on most big weekends they may
issue half as many.

Only one summons was
issued for violation of the noise
ordinance. Frank Ellerbe at the
Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity was
issued a summons at 1:30 a.m.
Sunday. -

Lt. C. H. Emore was the of-
ficer in charge of the night force
this weekend. He said that the
weekend could have been

worse, that things went
smoothly considering the
crowds.

Abraham, Cotter, Geary Are

Steve Abraham, Les
Cotter, and Cove Geary
were the winners in Mon-
day’s Big Three Elec-
tions for the student body
government offices of
president, vice president,
and secretary.

Abraham defeated write-in
candidate Chris Burnham for
the office of next year’s student

body president by a vote of 438
to 322.

Les Cotter, who ran without
opposition, won the office of
vice president with 586 votes.

Cove Geary, a write-in can-
didate, defeated law student
Kevin Ross 256-116 for the office
of secretary.

Winners In Big Three Election

Abraham collected most of
the undergraduate vote in the
race for the presidency. He poll-
ed 231 votes on the colonnade to
Burnham’s 111. Abraham also
won at the freshman quad
voting area, 174-95.

But Burnham found a source
of strength in the law school
where his campaign was tied to
Ross. Burnham collected 116
votes in the law school to
Abraham’s 33.

Both Ross and Geary found
their support on their respec-
tive sides of the bridge. Geary
found only nine votes in the law
school and Ross pulled in seven
votes on the undergraduate
campus. Z

Rents Increased At Hotel

 

by Joe Scott

Rents at the Robert E. Lee Hotel are going
up between 25 and 110 percent for apartments
currently being offered by new owner Clyde
Mull.

Elderly residents now living in the hotel say
that they cannot afford the rent increases and
some say that they will have to leave.

Washington and Lee University will not
renew its current contract for overflow
freshmen housing at the hotel, even though
they have an option to do so.

Potential office space at the hotel will not be
used as such now because prospective rentors
have backed away from the deal.

Clyde Mull has begun major renovations to
the hotel which he says will be expensive.

The new single room rates are $125 per
month on a 10- month lease. Previous hotel
rents already under contract depend on the
particular situation and Mull said that the
size of the room and size or lack of a bathroom
determine the rents.

Upperclassmen and law students presently
live at the hotel. Marc Birenbaum, a junior,
said that he now pays $100 a month for his
fifth floor room which consists of a single

room with a full bath. He also said that the
rents will remain the same until his lease ex-
pires.

Eight elderly people live on the fourth floor.
Their rents vary accordingly, from $150 for
two adjoining rooms with bath, to $140 for one
large room with bath. The standard rent was
$100 for a single room.

Leases were never drawn between the
previous owners and the elderly residents and
as a result the new rent increases went into ef-
fect March 1.

The new leases at the hotel have several
restrictions.

There is a $100 deposit per room, no option
to renew the lease, a requirement to pay the
first and last month’s rent upon signing the
document, a clause forbidding all pets, a
clause forbidding all objects to be off the win-
dowsills (including the leasee himself sitting
on it) and a clause forbidding all cooking ap-
pliances, heating appliances or ‘‘light
housekeeping” appliances. There is also a
clause that states ‘‘no overnight guests will be
permitted on the leased premises.”’

‘In the event the premises are occupied in
such a manner as to constitute a nuisance to

SAB To Profit
On Fancy Dress

by John Billmyre

The Student Activities Board
could make as much as $3,500 in
profits from this year’s Fancy
Dress Ball.

Traditionally, the SAB has
lost money on Fancy Dress.

‘We budgeted to lose about
$5,000 originally, but several
circumstances resulted in a
profit,”’ said SAB treasurer Bill
Ridge about the $8,000 dif-
ference in the budget figure and
the final tally.

Ridge estimated that a total
of 1,800 tickets were sold at $15
apiece, for a ticket sales total of
$27,000.

Expenses, as closely as they
can be determined at this time,

were estimated at $22,763.55 by
Ridge, for an overall profit on
Fancy Dress of $4,236.45.

One bill, from Buildings and
Grounds for the after-theBall
clean-up, is still outstanding,
Ridge said. He cautioned that
the clean-up bill could run over
$1,000.

James L. Arthur, Superinten-
dent of Buildings and Grounds,
said this year’s clean-up was no
worse than last year’s. The bill
last year was $754.85, Arthur
said.

One major saving over last
year, according to Ridge, was
the cost of Thursday night’s
entertainment. The Vandales

Contact Debate Scheduled For Wednesday

Former Sen. Eugene McCar-
thy and publisher William A.
Rusher will debate on ‘The
Directions for the 1980s”
Wednesday, March 21, at 8 p.m.
in Lee Chapel

Anticipated as topics of
debate between the two men
will be the United States’ chang-
ing posture on China, the
energy crisis, the balance of
power in Europe, and other
issues expected to affect the
U.S inthe next decade.

MeCarthy is best
remembered today for his
“yrassroots’’ presidential cam-
paign in 1968 which gave a large
boost to the antiwar movement
opposing the Vietnam War.

He again ran for the presiden-
cy in 1976 as an Independent
charging that the United States’
two-party political system was
obselete and had led to ‘‘bipar-
tisan war, bipartisan economic
tailures, and abuse of the Bill of
Rights under both parties.”

McCarthy served as a Con-
“ressman from Minnesota's 4th
District in the 8lst to the 85th
Congresses. ;

He became one of Min-
nesota’s Senators in 1958 and
during his 12-year tenure in the
U.S. Senate was a_ ranking
member on the Senate Finance,
the Foreign Relations, and the
Government Operations com-
mittees.

He is author of several books,
among them **A Liberal Answer
to the Conservative Challenge,”
“The Year of the People,”’ and
“Mr. Racoon and His Friends.”

McCarthy

Currently, he is a syndicated
columnist writing on political
issues for a number of major
newspapers across the country,
among them the Washington
Star.

William <A. Rusher is
recognized as one of the
foremost spokesmen for the
conservative viewpoint in the
country today.

He has been the publisher of

William F. Buckley’s journal
National Review since 1957.

Rusher has also made regular
appearances on ‘The’ Ad-
vocates,"’ an Emmy Award-
winning program on the Public
Broadcasting System. He has
also appeared on the ABC
television network’s ‘‘Good
Morning, America” show.

EC Lends Rugby Club $450

by David Greer

The Student Body Executive
Committee voted to lend the
Rugby Club $450 for the pur-
chase of uniforms.

Club member Doug Willis told
the EC that the club has ordered
30 uniforms for $900 and expects
them to arrive C.O.D. on Fri-
day.

Willis said that the club can’t
collect the entire $900 by Fri-
day, and that the $900 price in-
cludes a special deal that will
give the club extra equipment,
such as rugby balls.

Willis said that last year the
Rugby Club received $1,000
from the EC. Of the that money,
about $300 is left.

Willis said that he does not
know exactly where the money
went, though he is not treasurer
of the club.

He added, though, that closer
track will be kept of the money
in the future.

Sophomore — representative
Bob Willis made the motion to
lend the club the $450, to be paid
back one week after Spring
Break.

EC vice president Bill Tucker
voted against the proposal, say-
ing, ‘‘I don’t see that the job of
the EC is lending money to
athletic teams, be it rugby or
lacrosse or anything.”’

First year law representative
Neal Brickman added that he

would like to see ‘‘some sort of
accounting method that can be
visible’’ used by the team in the
future.

In other business, EC presi-
dent Beau Dudley said he does
not foresee any action being
taken this year on the athletic
petition. The petition requested
leaving one basketball court in
the gym open for student use.

Dudley said that President
Huntley and Dr. Elmes, of the
faculty athletic committee,
gave the impression that

nothing would be done this year.

Junior representative Steve
Abraham said that he had
heard complaints about cam-
paign posters being torn down
on the Colonnade.

Abraham said that one stu-
dent told him he saw a professor
removing a campaign poster.

Dudley said that he would
check with Buildings and
Grounds, saying they may have
a policy against putting tape on
the white column surfaces.

lease null and void and take
possession of said premises
without recourse to a court of
law.”

Parking is extra too. It’s $10a
month for a reserved space in
the lot behind the hotel.

Elderly Leaving

Several elderly residents of
the hotel are leaving because of
rent increases which they can-
not afford.

‘The reason why we are leav-
ing is because of the rent in-
creases,”’ said one elderly resi-
dent of the hotel. The resident
refused to be identified because
of fear of antagonizing the new
owner. ‘‘We are looking for a
place right now,” the resident
adds.

“It’s not justified for me
(referring to the rent increase)
because I’m on a fixed in-
come,’’ comments one resident.
“I told him (Mull) that we
couldn’t pay the extra money,”
adds another. ‘‘Oh, sure, we'll
have to cut back on some
things.”

“We have nowhere to go,”
they said. ‘‘We haven’t found a
place yet,” they continued. ‘“‘We
are also at a disadvantage, we
have no furniture,’™ they state.
“If you can find a furnished
place as convenient as this, then
I'd like to know about it.’’ The
rent has to be reasonable
though.

“I’m leaving,’ states Arthur
Silver who recently turned 90
years old. ‘‘If I can find a room,
I’ll stay through the summer,”’
Silver adds. ‘‘If I can’t find a
room, well...I’drather not say,”
continues Silver commenting on
whether he feels the 25 percent
increase is fair.

“I will tell you that the rent
increase weighed heavily in my
decision to stay or leave, I have
enjoyed my stay here though,”’
Silver said.

Silver informed Mull that he

Clyde Mull, the new owner of
the Robert EF. Lee Hotel.

 

“Just Social Security and
that's all,’ said Herbert
Camden while outlining his
financial situation. His rent is
also now $125 a month. “I'll
have to live with it,” he adds.
‘*My intentions up till now are to
stay."’ Camden continues.
‘Sure I'll have to cut back on
some things **

“I have to spend a couple
dollars a day for cabs,” says

Camden. “I'm slightly — in-
capacitated. I cant walk
much.”

“I'd rather have lower rents

and see the place full, than
higher rents and few people,”
Camden said.

“Tll have to wait and see,”
said Danny Barker, an
employee for the hotel. *'$125
for two rooms — I’m paying
that rate until the end of March.
He, (Mull) wants $200,” con-
tinues Barker. ‘‘I'd like to have
two rooms at the old rate but I
don’t think that’s possible. I
might have to move,” ends
Barker.

‘“He’s raised everybody’s
rent $25,”’ said Bill Thompson,
now part-time employee of the
hotel. He also lives at the hotel
but has not as yet had his rent
raised on his fourth floor room.
“Everything is going up,’’ said
Tho son. “Here it was reflected
in the rents. I shouldn’t say
anything more about it,” said
Tho son.

Other residents declined to
comment on the new rents.

Silver reflected the general
attitude of the non-college
residents. He, as others stated,
said that the rent increase
would be a burden, it would
jeopardize their opportunity to
stay at the hotel, but nothing
could be done about it because
of the lack of affordable housing
in the area.

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity will not renew its lease con-
tract with the Robert E. Lee
Hotel, Dean H. Robert Huntley
said. The lease terminates at
the end of theschool year. |

The Associate Dean of
Students said that the Universi-
ty presently rents the second
and third floors of the hotel for
$575 per single room and $525
per person for a double.

The figures were arrived at
by taking the price of the most

‘expensive single offered on

campus and using that as a rate
for the rooms. The double room
prices were arrived at through
similar means. The reason for
those prices, Huntley said, was
because the hotel rooms were
more luxurious than other
rooms.

Thirty freshmen now live in
the hotel with two dormitory
counsellors.

Huntley said that one reason
why the University would not
renew its lease was because of
differences in the contract
negotiations with hotel owner
Clyde Mull. The University,
however, can still renew its
lease.

Parking Lot
Dispute

One dispute resulted from an
oral agreement with the
previous owners of the hotel
which allowed freshmen to park
in the hotel's lot free of charge.
Mull rejected that agreement
when ownership was transfer-
red to him, which he is legally
entitled to do, and as a result
has asked students living at the
hotel to pay a $10 parking
charge if they want a reserved
space.

Huntley reported that two
students agreed to pay the fee
but that others wishing not to
pay were given permission to
park in the ‘A’ parking lots.
which normally exclude

freshmen automobiles
When asked whether
Washington and Lee will have
an overflow of students next
year and the problem of finding
them available housing,
Huntley remarked that there
will be no overflow of freshmen
and that the University was
aiming for 350 admissions.
‘That is another reason why we
will not lease hotel spaces,”
said Huntley. ‘“‘We won't need
that extra room.”’
Business Deal
Fell Through

The potential renting of the
second and third floors of the
Robert E. Lee Hotel to the
Rockbridge Board of Super-
visors and County School Board
fell through, said Mull, while in-
dicating the outcome with his
thumb pointing to the floor.

Each group was considering
renting seven office spaces, ten
storage spaces, and seven park-
ing spots. The County School
Board was also considering ren-
ting the second floor ballroom.

The rents being considered
were $1270 per month for the
one excluding the ballroom and
$1420 for the one with the extra
room. Mull stated that he is still
willing to allow office space but
made it clear that spaces were
limited and on a ‘“‘first come,
first serve basis.” -

“The whole ball of wax is
riding on this,” said Mull, while
sitting in his new office at the
hotel. “I don’t have much
money,” he adds. “I’ve mor-
tgaged everything. I have no
regrets about it though.”’

“It’s a free
enterprise system”

In explaining the large rent
increase, Mull explained that
“It’s a free enterprise system.”’
and that he personally sees a
return on his new investment.

“There is an expensive mon-
thly amount of dollars and cents
going out to Keep this building in
operation,’ Mull added.

Mull also commented in a
Feb. 15 Ring-tum Phi interview
that ‘‘these residents have been
paying rent figures which
haven't kept up with the times
for many years.”’

Regarding the current park-
ing situation said that “if they
(W&L freshmen) were entitled
to parking they'd get it,” but
they aren’t. ‘It’s in my finan-
cial interests” to charge $10 a
parking space because ‘‘money
has to be generated’ to patch,
pave and line that lot. That
money has got to come from
somewhere, Mull said.
‘Guaranteed parking would be
almost impossible,’ continued
Mull.

There are roughtly 33 spaces
in the lot and only eight left to
rent.

Commenting on his respon-
sibility to the elderly people liv-
ing in the hotel, Mull said that
he is “not running a home for
the aged. I don't get subsidized
by the government to pay my
bills.

“] don't think that’s my

responsibility,’ added Mull
referring to his help in possible
relocation. ‘‘They're not

obligated to me or me to them.”
Moving now to the low cost
housing situation, Mull said that

“the city and county have made
certain kinds of efforts.

“Look at Buena Vista,” he
said, ‘150 housing units were
built and most were occupied.
Next year they were vacant
because the people couldn't pay
their utility bills.” It, un-
fortunately, is a fact of life, he
said.

In Lexington there are three
low income housing situations
with long waiting lists. ‘If the
city condemns X number of
houses a year, where do they
relocate those people. Of course
the building costs cannot be
overlooked. Prices have
skyrocketed.’

The hotel ‘‘isn’t a solution to
the housing situation in Lex-

that the color would be similar
to the present one. The outside
trim will also be repainted, pro-
bably white, and also said there
was a possibility of
sandibasting the exterior
brickwork ‘‘especially in the
back where soot and dirt have
discolored the bricks.”

Mull plans to ‘‘use some im-
agination” and ‘‘dress it up,”
referring to the lobby, in order
to make it attractive.

The hotel water system need-
ed a lot of repairs, said Mull.
The hot water tank was cracked
but a new one should be here
this week he added. ‘This
should double the available hot
water and solve the water pro-

ington — it takes more than my
effort. Last year, 31 students
had to go somewhere. I can pro-
vide 31 spaces plus 31 more.
This can free-up housing around
town,” Mull added.
Going After
Student Rentals

‘What I’m going after is the
student rentals,’ said Mull.
“I’ve been in it for years and I
think I have the experience and
know-how for safe comfortable
living conditions at a cost they
can afford. I’m hope this will
drive 70-odd students to the
Robert E. Lee.’

According to Mull’s play, he
intends to have 70 rooms ready
for the next school year. Ten of
the rooms will be doubles. He
also emphasized he ‘won't hold
rooms empty for offices."’

The subject of repairs evoked
a large response from Mull. He
stated that the building was in
good shape but wasn't quite up
to his standards. Mull said that
he would individually check
every room and fix all pro-
blems.

Repairs

‘All the rooms and halls will
be repainted."’ said Mull adding

blem*’ The timer on the boiler
also had to be replaced at a cost
of over $400.

The present system of oil heat
is going to be changed, Mull
said, and it would be converted
to oil and gas at a cost of ap-
proximately $4,000. Mull said
this system would be more
economical.

To help conserve heat, Mull
said he was going to install
“foyer type doors” in the three
main entrances. “This should
conserve a lot of energy.”’ he
said, and hoped to have the
doors installed in a few weeks.

Referring to the total cost,
Mull said that ‘he will have to
wait and see how much money
is generated."’ The necessity of
the repair will determine its
priority, Mull added. ‘It
depends on how many leases
are signed” in the near future.
“That's the Virginia way, you
pay as you go.

“It's showing good signs,”
concluded Mull, *‘and I've made
no shocking discoveries. I'll try
to work with it the best I can
with the amount of resources |
have at my disposal. | think it
will work out well,” he said.

Musical Mainstream

Remote Control
The Tubes
A &MSP4751

The Tubes are nothing if not
misunderstood. They’ve been
called everything from punk
rockers to ‘‘art’’ rockers
(neither of which is true), and
occasionally portrayed as a
group of drug-crazed perverts
intent upon destroying the
moral fiber of American society
(this last no doubt inspired by

the tongue-in-cheek ‘‘Don’t
Touch Me There’ and the
underground classic. ‘White

Punks on Dope’’).

The key to understanding and
even enjoying the Tubes,
though, is never to take them
seriously (they certainly don’t
take themselves seriously). A
close look at the band’s record-
ed work to date, and more par-
ticularly their stage show,
reveals that the Tubes are a
cultural phenomenon above all
else.

These guys are satirists more
than musicians (though their
musical skills are quite ade-
quate). Their most recent stage
show featured a take-off on
punk rock, complete with safety
pins, a chain saw, and vile lead
singer. During ‘‘Smoke (Vie en
Fumer),’’ the band poked fun at

America’s nicotine habit.

The Tubes in concert are a
unique experience, though it
should be noted that some parts
of the show are not designed for
those easily offended.

Translating the humor and
skill of their live performances
onto viny] has been difficult for
the band, however — until now.
Remote Control is by no means
a great record, but it does
showcase the Tubes’ inherent
strengths (and minimize their
weaknesses) more effectively
than any of the group’s releases
to date.

It doesn’t seem right to call it
a “concept”’ album That im-
plies a great deal of thought and
levity — but the album’s songs
all deal with one subject; name-
ly, television. (Check out the
cover if nothing else — it’s a
minor classic.) The songs and
melodies range from fair to ex-
cellent, with “Turn Me On”’ in
the former category and
“Prime Time,” the single from
the LP, in the latter (could this
one make it on AM radio? ).

As usual, it’s the lyrics that
carry this Tubes album. Par-
ticularly strong are “TV Is
King” and ‘‘Telecide’’ (‘TV
suicide/Whht a lovely way to
die’). Remote Control is a

Love, Wit, Reality:

 

by R.B. Ramirez
“Truth is lies told by a woman,”’
— Ferenc Molnar

Opening next week at the
University Theatre is a show
that has a lot to say...to anyone
who cares much about love, wit,
or the struggle to arrive at an
objective concept of reality.

The play, The Guardsman,
was written by Ferenc Molnar,
a name that, here and now
means very little to us; we
know about as much about it as
we do of 1910 Budapest, both the
setting of the play and the home
of Molnar when he wrote it.

Well, it won’t hurt to know '

more. _
Molnar, after all, was a
leader in the final spasm of

thoroughly enjoyable album, as
long as it’s taken in the spirit
with which it was offered — a
lot of fun with perhaps the
tiniest bit of social commentary
thrown in.

Why does the W&L Bookstore
charge $10 for The Complete
Book of Running when the
Crown Book Stores in
Washington are selling it for
$6.50? The answer is, of course,
a matter of economics, as is the
case with so much of life today.
Crown Books, with their satura-
tion advertising is concen-
trating on current best-sellers
and remainders with -high-
volume fast turnover sales. The
margin of profit on each sale is
very narrow. The owner of

Eastern European _intellec-
tualism before the Great War
ended forever an age that is
remote to us as that of Louis
XIV. Molnar was a sensation in
the old Hapsburg Empire;
there he did for the theatre what
Klimt, Freud, Schonberg,
Mahler, and Kafka were doing
for their respective callings:
giving birth to the 20th century.

It was a new order of thought
to which he belonged, one which
must have realized how much of
the old order depended upon the
gifts of illusion, and how the
time was coming when those il-
lusions could no longer be sus-
tained. The plot of The Guard-
sman has to do with a married
couple, both actors, and she
with a roving eye.

Nandor, the husband, in a
desperate effort to circumvent
the infidelities of his wife Ilona
decides to masquerade as the
Guardsman, and to become not
the husband of the unfaithful
wife, but the lover. She appears
to be taken in, and a romance
ensues, one rooted in the almost
never-grasped option of rejec-
ting the factual, in favor of the
illusion, if that indeed is what
pleases the best.

The play capitalizes effective-

The University Theatre company work out another part of The Guardsman.

Eye And Ear:

Crown Books Stores has strong
financial backing from his

_ father and is expanding rapidly

in the Northern Virginia - DC
area. Independent booksellers
are suffering and yelling bloody
murder. Crown Books claim
that books are too expensive
(and I certainly agree) and that
they are selling what the public
wants. But, the small full-
service stores argue that Crown
Books is doing a disservice to
discriminating and intelligent
readers, now and in the future,

ly upon the device of the play
within the play: the second act
is set in a box at the Budapest
Opera House, and is filled with
telling double  entendres,
characters commenting osten-
sibly on the scene being played
before them, but also, and —
this is important — consciously,
on the scene which they realize
they themselves are playing.

It isn’t until the final act that
we find out that the wife was
never deceived by the hus-
band’s ruse, and didn’t need to
be. The relish of the affair was
not in its substance but its
pretense: sex and love were not
the point of the adultery so
much as the psyche’s need to
wallow in a fantasy of those
very things.

Being confronted with the
truth in the end, in fact, spoils
the entire thing; in fact, Ilona’s
restlessness once again takes
control, and we leave her look-
ing out of a window, waiting not
for love or truth but illusion and
fantasy, a luxury’ she
recognizes and has allowed
herself to enjoy.

I urge you to enjoy the luxury
of seeing the show, certainly

with its narrow selection.

If you want a book which
Crown does not have, they will
not get it for you. Too, Crown
books does not carry so-called
“back list’’ titles. These books
of literary and _ intellectual
merit, are to be found only in
the ‘‘personal’’ bookstores
which comprise the backbone of
the book selling industry. I
would bet, on little direct
knowledge, that many of the
best selling paperbacks of the
W&L Bookstore would not be
found at Crown Books. It seems
to me that at Crown Books peo-
ple browse for bargains rather
than for books.

Bookselling is more than mer-
chandising, it is shared en-
thusiasm for the printed word in
all its vagaries.

iRocky Horror!

by Mark Kinniburgh and
Dick Barron
Media Kids-at-large

Here it is, go see it. The
Rocky Horror Picture Show
will be screened Friday and
Saturday nights at 9:30 p.m.
and midnight and Sunday at
2:00 p.m. in W&L’s duPont
auditorium. We can’t add
anything new to what has
already been said in every ma-
jor publication in the United
States about this movie, but we
can say it’s the most unique
visual experience to hit W&L in
many a year.

During the past two years,
The Rocky Horror Picture Show
has reached bona fide cult
status in the U.S. A film adapta-
tion of the Broadway hit, The
Rocky Horror Show, this film
has attracted a loyal folloiwng
of theater goers who make an
evening of imitating characters
in the movie, complete with
costumes and props.

Fans have always imitated
their screen favorites, most
recently adopting the horn-
rimmed glasses, funny ties, and
loose clothing inspired by Annie
Hall. Rocky Horroradds a new
twist to this type of character
imitation — its fans donning full
transvestite regalia.

Let us explain. Rocky Horror
is a spoof of the horror story
genre, complete with a mad
scientist, in this case, a
transvestite named Dr. Frank
N. Furter. The plot is simple—
two innocents stumble into the
doctor’s strange laboratory
world, which holds such outlan-
dish characters as a warped
butler, a loboto- . mized
delivery boy, a blonde, well-
muscled thing, created by the

Guardsman

(continued from page 4)
scripts to be produced at W&L
in a very long time.

The Guardsman, and, in fact,

Molnar, has not received the at-
tention deserved. This expres-
sionistic treatment of a man
and wife abstracting
themselves from their lives, in
order to remark on them, to
themselves, to each other, and
to us, remains a landmark in
the astonishing progress of 20th
century continental drama.

doctor, and scores of zanies in
skin-tite pants and kiddie
sunglasses. Sounds good? Keep
reading.

Put it all together and it spells
ninety minutes of fun-filled con-
fusion. The characters in the
film are composites, bringing to
mind standard types from
Frankenstein toClose En-
counters. Richard O’brien’s
clever screenplay, music and
lyrics provide a healthy dose of
“gorgeous gals, thrills and
chills, and lotsa larfs and sex.”

The actors are excellent in
their performances, portraying
their roles with indisputable
clarity. Tim Curry, as the mad
Frank N. Furter is both comic
and hauntingly melodramatic

in his theatrical performance.
As the naive Janet, Susan
Sarandon and her obvious
female charms are alone worth
the price of admission, but she
also demonstrates a clear ac-
ting ability.

Rocky Horror is a_ fine
musical as well, most of the
dialogue being set to music
ranging from Rock ‘N Roll to
sing-along Broadway. A special
favorite of most audiences is
“The Time Warp,” named after
a dance similar to the ever-
popular “‘hokey pokey” (’’It’s
just a jump to the left/and then
a step to the right. . .”’). Also
notable is Meatloaf’s rendition
of ‘‘Hot Potootie Bless My Soul’’

the Bottom Line and proceeded
to knock over his table while
getting up to leave, spilling a
very noticeable bottle of reds in
the process, and no doubt thank-
ing his stars that he was in the
Big Apple rather than Toronto.

The rest of the band was safe-
ly tucked away in Nassau at the
time, finishing up work on their
new album and mixing down
some tapes from last summer’s
tour for two King Biscuit
Flower Hour broadcasts to be
aired this spring.

The old theory that musicians
never learn from past mistakes
has recently been reinforced by
a whole slew of musically
disastrous reunion albums that
have appeared in the past few

‘months. The previously men-

tioned McGuinn, Clark, and
Hillman Bank has made a se-
cond try at a Byrds reunion (the
first one having been one of the
biggest financial catastrophes
in the history of the business).
The Guess Who are back
toegther, sans Randy Bachman
and Burton Cummings, the only
ones who really mattered. Badf-
inger has made a second try,
once again without the
assistance of two key members,
and, last but not least, the
Allman Brothers, still trying to
shake off the deaths of Duane
Allman and Berry Oakley, are
back with a new album on

Capricorn entitled ‘‘Enlighten-
ed Rogues.”’

Judging by the looks of
things, the spring of 1979 could
well be a monentous one for
rock’n’roll. Among the artists
due for new releases in the next
few months are Patti Smith,
Nick Lowe, Foreigner, Tom
Robinson, Manfred Mann, Ex-
ile, Cheap Trick, Carlene
Carter, Chuck Berry, Yes,
ELP, Ian Hunter (backed by
Springsteen’s E Street Band),
and, the king of rock’n’roll
himself, Shaun Cassidy.

And, believe it or not, that’s
only a random sampling of
what’s to come. So keep your
ears and eyes open for the spr-
ing of “79 — it may be one of the
best yet. *

The Return of the Pink Panther Peter Sellers, Christopher Plum-

Applauded by critics as well as audiences across the country,
Return brings back Peter Sellers as the greatest comedy series

Clouseau. Also back again are all the creative talents who have
made the Pink Panther films so irresistible Writer-director Blake
Edwards, composer Henry Mancini, animator Richard Williams.
Clouseau’s attempts to recover a precious jewel, stolen from a Mid-

Ace Weems

This weekend, the ever-
popular Ace Weems and the Fat
Meat Boys will return to the
Cockpit. This will be the band’s
first appearance on campus
since they opened the show for
the Allstars at the Library Par-
ty, and many remember what a
rousing performance it was.

James Leva and Chad
Crumm are the fiddlers for the
Fat Meat Boys, and although
both are from the north, they
have a very distinct old
southern sound. When asked
about the group’s unusual
name, they told the tale of an
English shepherd, Ace Weems,
who, while tending his sheep,
constantly played Irish folk
tunes on his fiddle. His music
was overheard by some
pilgrims on their way to the
Crusades, and they broke out
their instruments, and began to
play. They played until the
Crusades ended and all settled
down to fiddling their lives
away.

The Fat Meat Boys have
played up and down the East
Coast, and spend their sum-
mers at festivals and in Mar-
tha’s Vineyard as_ well.
Although they make their home
in Lexington, they do not like to
be known as a “‘local’”’ band.
“That sort of classifies us in a
way that is unflattering” says

What Can Be Done A

by Randy Smith
‘Hey buddy, can you lend mea dime?”

You've probably met him, accidently. His
name is unimportant, and on this particular
spring-like day he was teetering on the
sidewalk in front of Lexington’s Alcohol
Beverage Control (ABC) store.

He's not much on conversation. His red,
glassy eyes seem to look in your direction, but
not really at you. His clothes are ill- fitting
and dirty. His hair is greasy, and his breath
reeks of cheap wine

And he’s asking you for money.

You tell him sorry, and continue on your
way up the street. And you might think to
yourself, ‘What a nuisance these town drunks
are,

In the summer they lounge in front of the
Lyric Cinema and walk up the alley to sun
next to the post office for the afternoon, their
bottle safely hidden in the bushes nearby.

Even in the cold of winter you see them.
Some find shelter on the long winter days ina
room above Clayton’s Taxi on Jefferson
Street.

They are Lexington’s visible alcohol pro-
blem, and nobody really seems to know what
to do about them.

But street inebriants account for only three
percent of the alcoholic population in
Rockbridge County, according to Dr. Robert
P. Varley, director of Alcohol Services of
Rockbridge, Inc., and a former Episcopalian
bishop.

In a recently released state- wide survey
conducted by Virginia's Mental Health and
Mental Retardation Board, Lexington was
ranked fourth in the number of alcohol
related deaths per population in the survey.
Nearby Buena Vista was ranked third.

Lexington was llth in the state in the
number of alcohol related arrests per popula-
tion. Buena Vista was 10th.

As the State Board—which has access to all
hospital records throughout Virginia— aptly
pul it: “The highest arrest rates for alcohol
related violations generally are found in the
southwest, more rural areas of the state.”

The Street Drunk

Although Varley said that there is really no
typical street drunk, he painted a grim
general picture:

“He has no particular skills. He lives in a
one-room arrangement. It's much easier,
frankly, to have a bottle of Ripple or Wild
Irish Rose than it is to cook a piece of food.

“Occasionally, they'll do half a day’s work.
But emotionally and psychologically they are
incapable of any long-term work. They'll
work for a day or two, and make enough

_ money for the next bottle.

“But I'll say this, they're the most generous
guys going. When they get a bottle, they don't
keep it for themselves, they look for a buddy
toshare it.”

 

Varley said most public drunks come from
disadvantaged backgrounds‘‘that economic
bracket where they couldn’t rub two cents
together’’—and their level of education is
usually no better than the sixth or seventh
grade.

They are victims of ‘a high rate of
unemployment, a high rate of illiteracy, and
social frustration,’’ Varley said. ‘‘They are in
a constantly depressed state.”

 

He says his name is Jesse and he’s looking for
work,

His problems are that it is 7 p.m., he has not
bathed in several days, and that he killed off the
better half of a fifth of gin before he walked into
the fraternity house, bottle in hand.

He stumbled around, pretending or thinking
that he knew the students, asking for a job, offer-
ing his bottle.

tt first he was fun to play with—he got confus-
ed when he was spoken to—but the students
quickly tired of making fun of him and left the
roam,

No one could persuade fim to leave. So he
slaved,

He wanted work. “Give me a chance,” he said.

“TL used to work here.” But he couldn't remember
when. He didn't remember any of the faces on
the old fraternity composite pictures.

All he wanted was a job.

His words became more slurred as he slowly
finished his bottle. He began to cry. He got sick
to his stomach. He had been out of work for
seven or eight years, he said.

His bottle was empty by the time he was
escorted out the door. None of the college
students had wanted to touch him, but he
wouldn't have left without “assistance.”

He staggered and fell, got up and weaved his
way slowly down the street toward the next
fraternity house. ,

 

“I think we have to define one thing,’
Varley cautioned, ‘‘they (street drunks) have
the most visibility, but that class of alcoholic
represents, at best, only three percent of the
alcoholic population.”

“The unfortunate part of it is,’’ he con-
tinued, ‘‘that that three percent gets about 80
percent of the attention.”’

Read recently hired Mrs. Dawna G. Day, a
graduate of West Virginia University, on a
federal grant to help him organize
Rockbridge County’s interdiction program,
among other duties.

“We're going to move in on all of them,”
Read said of his plans to interdict more of
Lexington’s street drunks.

He has vague plans to send them to Dr.
Varley’s 15 month- old alcohol services
center. From there, he anticipates they will
be sent to an alcohol treatment institution, but
at least they’ll be off the streets and out of

, town.

Dr. Varley disagrees, however, that alcohol
treatment programs are an effective answer
for the street drunk’s problems.

sistently with this mood-altering chemical,
that euphoric state is normal— sobriety is ab-
normal.”

Street drunks, said Varley, have ‘‘some
brain damage’”’ as a result of their prolonged
use of alcohol.

“Their ability to comprehend just isn’t
there,” he said. ‘And you can try
psychotherapy, or behavior modification, or
reality therapy and you're just whistling dixie
with a mouthful of crackers.”

‘You don’t break a habit of long-standing in
just 28 days,”’ Varley said.

He also noted that they probably wouldn’t
be able to pay for the treatment. They usually
have no insurance and, if they are lucky, they

“It’s completely useless to send a street
alcoholic to a treatment center. They can’t
take it,”’ he said.

“It’s absolutely dumb to take these guys off
the street, bring them in, give them a cake of
soap, a towel, and a shower, and clean sheets.
They’re totally out of it.”

Varley explained that every time a person
gets drunk, he kills 10,000 brain cells that can
never be used again.

“When they bathe their bodies so con-

   

might claim a social security check.

“People say, ‘If they only used willpower.’
But willpower is absolutely worthless for the
addict. They’ve lost it. Alcohol does not
destroy the will’ but it significantly bends it so
that these people are incapable of making
responsible judgments.”

“They are just like advanced diabetics or
advanced epileptics: they need help, but do
not respond to traditional types of therapy,”
Varley said.

. New Library Has Problems

by Joe Dashiell

As construction of the new
undergraduate library nears
completion, several problems
still remain with the library’s
operation.

The major problem is with
students using the emergency
exits on the lower levels instead
of the main exit on the upper
level, Head Librarian Maurice
D. Leach said Wednesday.

The upper level door is in-
tended to be the only regular ex-
it for two reasons, Leach said.

First, from time to time,
books are removed from the
library without first being
checked out. In past inven-
tories, losses have been as high
as 2,000 volumes out of the
200,000 volume total inventory,
Leach said,

He noted that a major con-
sideration in the decision to in-
stall an alarm system rather
than a closed-circuit television
monitoring system was the ex-
istence of the honor code at
Washington and Lee.

In addition, Leach said the
staff conducts studies to deter-
mine how best to utilize the
library’s facilities. “We want to
know who is in the building. We
do statistical counts here that
determine when the building is
open, when it's closed, and what
types of services to provide at
different hours,’ Leach said.

The problem has just become
apparent because workmen
recently finished installing the
alarm system which monitors
the emergency exits.

When a person uses one of the

exits, an alarm sounds behind
the circulation desk, as well as
at the exit.

library's checkout) system, see
Letters to the Editor, page 10.

Recommends "'F lop House”
Varley recommended establishing a ‘flop
house”’ or a “halfway house"’ in Rockbridge
County as the best way of giving the recover-
ing alcoholic ‘‘a chance to get reintroduced in-
to society.”

‘I think we could raise enough money to ac-
quire an old motel, and people would respond
quite readily in an effort to get them off the
street,’’ Varley said. ‘‘But then maintaining it
is going to be the problem because these guys
can’t contribute.”

Attorney Read did not share Varley’s op-
timism for the ‘flop house” concept for treat-
ment. ‘‘I will vehemently oppose a halfway
house, a flop house, or any similar program in
our community,’’ he said.

“I’m for shipping them out,’’ Read said.
The Commonwealth’s Attorney wants to get
the public drunk out of town and into treat-
ment centers like the ones in Harrisonburg,
Charlottesville, and Roanoke. He does not
want to start a treatment center here.

Varley would like to see some sort of a pro-
gram set up for the street drunks in this area.

“They (street drunks) are untreatable, so
you don’t think of them in terms of treat-
ment,” Varley explained. ‘‘They’ve passed
the stage where they can respond. Treatment
should have happened long, long ago.”

“But because they too are human, because
they once had a mother, because they once
had a childhood, we can’t just cross them off
as derelicts, weak-willed or immoral people.

“If we think this through, we begin to look
upon them as people who are perhaps not
salvageable from their illness, but perhaps
we could provide a custodial care so they
don’t have to sleep in gutters, doorways, or
feeze to death in back alleys in the winter
months,”’ Varley said.

“I have no ready answer (for what can be
done to help the street drunks of Rockbridge
County),’’ Varley said, ‘‘but I think that a car-
ing, sharing, imaginative community should
cease condemning them and begin to help
them.”

Generals dump Sea Gulls

by Douglas Linton

The Lacrosse Generals
defeated the Sea Gulls of
Salisbury State College yester-
day afternoon by a score of
16-11, as some 1500 fans looked
on at Wilson Field. This victory
raises their regular season
record to 2-0.

Although it had rained for

most of the day, the game was
still held in the stadium. Along
with a slight wind, the muddy
conditions made for slippery
play and somewhat inhibited
each team’s performance.

The Sea Gulls jumped out to a
2-0 lead early in the first
quarter, but from that point on
Salisbury St. never scored two
consecutive goals. George San-
‘os scored first for the Generals
and after Salisbury St. respond-
2d with one more, John Black
and Jay Foster scored, respec-
ively, to make it 3-3. The Sea
aulls netted one more before
Mike Pressler made the score 4
apiece by the end of the first
juarter.

The second period saw Sandy
McDonald score twice, while
xeorge Santos tallied his se-

cond and John Kemp netted
what was to be the first of his
four goals. The Generals led 8-5
at the half.

Jeff Fritz and John Hooper
each had one in the third to
answer for each of the Sea
Gull’s_ tallies. It was 10-7,
Generals, with one quarter left
to play.

The final period had Santos
hitting his third score, as Fritz
also hit two more of his total of
three for the day. Kemp had an
outstanding period scoring
three more, one of which proved
to be the game winner.

Seven of the sixteen goals

were assisted. John Black had
three, while Fritz, Kemp,

Pressler, and Rob Staugaitis
each helped with one.

While Fritz had three goals
and an assist, it should still be
noted that he didn’t play the
whole game due to a high fever.
He played most of the second
half, but only 50 seconds in the
first. His assist came in these 50
seconds, cold off the bench!

Coach Emmer was fairly
pleased and especially happy
that his midfielders are scoring

Although it got its first

Field is in ‘‘pretty good shape,”’

RING-TUM PHI

  

Track team opens
season with second

by Greg Branan

Despite being at home last
Friday, the Generals managed
only a second place in the tri-
meet with Liberty Baptist Col-
lege and Roanoke. The score for
this year’s first outdoor meet
was Liberty Baptist - 83, W&L -
68, and Roanoke - 29.

In commenting on the meet,
Coach Norris Aldridge said,
‘“‘We performed to our
capabilities. It’s not that we
didn’t do well, they just did bet-
ter.”’ He added that Liberty
Baptist was much improved
over last year, “especially in
the weight and throwing
events.”’

The running events went ‘‘as
expected, with pretty good
times for this early in the
season.”

Top performers in the runn-
ing events included tri-captain,
Jack Norberg, who won the 440,
220 and ran a leg on the winning
440 relay team; another tri-
captain, Stewart Atkinson, who
placed second in the 100, 220 and
also ran a leg on the 440 relay
team; Chris Daniel, second in
the mile; and Rich Bird, third in
the mile. Coach Aldridge was
surprised at sweeping the 120
high hurdles. Placing first was
tri-captain Norvell Scott, se-
cond was Russ Rector, and
third was Jim Vines. Scott also

placed fourth in the in-
termediate hurdles as well as
won the long and triple jumps.
Rector also placed second in the
intermediates and third in the
high jump. Chris Leiser and
Jeff Brown completed the winn-
ing 440 relay team.

Coach Aldridge noted that,
“We had the best throws in the
discus for this early in the
season that we’ve had in a long
time. Liberty Baptist just threw
better.”’ Paul Manning and Phil
Dunley were the top performers
here. Also, Bob Campbell, hav-
ing improved over last year,
took second in the pole vault.

Coach Aldridge stated,
“There is room for improve-
ment.”’ Areas for improvement
are the shot-put, half mile,
three mile and high jump.
Aldridge anticipates improve-
ment as “ODAC championships
approach.”

Davidson
Next Meet

This weekend the Generals
travel to Davidson for the first
dual meet. Aldridge stated,
“It’s expected to be close as
they have improved and it’s go-
ing to take a good effort. It will
probably come down to who
gets the breaks.”’

Tennis Team Opens Season
With Romp Over Rochester

by Nat Lovell

On Tuesday, March 13, the
Generals whipped the visiting
University of Rochester.
Though the final score was 7-2,
the match was much closer
than expected with the
Generals having to clinch the
match in doubles.

At number one singles,
Stewart Jackson served and
volleyed his way to a routine
win over a quick but over-
matched Eric Friedman, 6-2,
6-2. Shaw Cranfield saw some
tough tennis in the first set
against Tom Lindh but his un-
canny touch carried him
through to a two-set victory 7-5,
6-1. Big Doug Gaker’s powerful

serve and long reach brought
him a victory over an obnoxious
Mike Mahoney at number three
singles 6-4, 6-4. First-match
pressure got the better of Dave
Constine as he went down to fine
playing John Conlin 0-6, 6-1, 6-2.
Pat Norris, better known for his
doubles prowess, lost a close
match to Chris Beck 7-5, 7-5. At
number six, Wes Yonge battled
through the upper court hur-
ricane to defeat an outclassed
Job Sanderval 6-1, 6-2.

Dominant Doubles
The Generals showed their
dominance in doubles, though
Jackson and Cranfield had to go
three sets to take their match

Lax team rolls 16-11;
Faces Syracuse Saturday

(continued from page 8)
earlier in the year.

According to tri-captain at-
tackman Jeff Fritz, the team
was ‘“‘on the field, but didn’t
really play.” The Generals
were down by an insurmoun-
table margin before they even
knew what hit them.

For some unknown reason,
many team members were
making mistakes that they had
not made in years. This is not in
following with the style of
lacrosse which W&L has been
and is accustomed to. Very
simply put, their customary

   
  
 
 

finesse, both individually and as
a team, was lacking.

Two critical mistakes includ-
ed the Generals twive dropping
the ball in ‘“‘man-up”’ situations.
Not only did W&L drop the ball,
but both times Mt. Washington
players recovered the loose ball
and charged downfield for
fastbreak tallies.

Besides W & L never really
getting their game together, it
must be noted that Mt.

Washington is an extremely
talented club. In the end, the
Generals are simply trying to
shake this one off and look to the
more important regular season.

pair were obviously unac-
customed to playing with each
other, but their pounding serves
and deft volleying proved too
much for the Rochester duo.

The score was 3-6, 6-1, 6-4.
Gaker’s serve and Constine’s
acrobatics at the net combined
for a solid win over Mahoney
and Conlin at number two
doubles 6-4, 6-3. Norris’ incisive
netplay and Yonge’s touch over-
whelmed Beck and Ken
Rasmussen as they romped to
close out the match 6-1, 6-2. The
Generals should have an easy
time versus Morehead State
this Saturday here in Lex-
ington.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

A well deserved
tip of the hat

March might seem like a strange time to write a year-end Enter-
tainment overview. .u contraire. Especially in the case of a wor-
thwhile program — a year-end review is worthless. Who can watch
a superb Film Society offering or hear a great band in the Cockpit
after the end of the year?

So here it is — a mid-year year-end commendation u1 two impor-
tant sources of entertainment this year.

As was Claimed early in the year it is now evident that the W&L
Film Society fills an entertainment gap for an impressive number
of people in the W&L community. Between 150 and 200 people have
viewed each of the Film Society’s five presentations this year. If a
constituency that large can be called a niche — the Film Society
has surely found its niche.

Praise of specific films isn’t the point here. Anyone who has
followed the series has his own favorite films and each of this
year’s films has generated a whole spectrum of opinion. Specific
opinions aren’t important — the chance to form them is.

Apparently many of us find it refreshing to be challenged by a
film rather than be asked to ‘switch off’’ for two hours. The Film
Society has done a risky thing — sticking its collective neck out for
the challenging films they've presented. And their gamble has paid
off.

That the Film Society provides a worthwhile service, well, there
is no question. Large audiences indicate that as do the film selec-
tions. This year’s focus on the ‘West German Film Renaissance of
the ’70's”’ for example, brings us not only films — but truly makes a
coherent series out of a segment of the Society’s offerings.

To those of us who are real film buffs — or those of us who wish
we knew more — this kind of careful, informed film selection can
only be beneficial.

There are two films remaining on the Society's docket this year,
one in late March and one in the spring. To those of you who haven't
taken advantage of the Society — go! — you're in for a differnt ex-
perience — perhaps a challenging two hours — but after all — it is
only a movie.

To the Film Society — my hat is off to you — for a job well done.

But this piece isn’t all high brow. For those of us who are seniors
the changes in the Cockpit over four years are rather profound.

Three years ago — not much really happened there (even the food
seemed lethargic).

Not only has the food picked up — but more to the point — now-a-
days — the cadets aren't the only entertainment down there. Burr
Datz and the University Center committee have tremendously ex-
panded and improved the entertainment available in our ‘pit.

When you get down to it — it’s pretty amazing some of the bands
who've played down there. The All-Stars, the Nighthawks, Glenn
Phillips. Amazing because of the consistently good shows — amaz-
ing because who could ever have dreamed that we could use
xeroxes from ‘Rolling Stone” to promote a band playing at W&L?

Datz and company have put the Cockpit on the map. so to speak.
By making a band feel at home and by providing en-
thusiastic audiences in the intimate setting of the Cockpit — Datz
has made the Cockpit a place where bands —- quality bands — like
to play and want to play.

The Cockpit provides a much needed alternative to the typical
Drifters/Beach Boys/Spinners fare. Rock ‘n Roll, the blues, new
wave, and folk have all had their day in the Cockpit.

Early this year there was some questioning of Cockpit cover
charges. After the Nighthawks, et al, most criticism of that prac-
tice has evaporated. What’s a buck to see a show that would cost $4
or $5 in DC?

The Film Society and the New Improved Cockpit, then are two
new — but important — sources of entertainment on campus. Each
venture, though questioned at the outset, has more than proven that
it deserves to exist — that it fills a definite entertainment gap, and
fill it well.

To these groups — thanks — to those who haven't availed
yourselves of the opportunities provided by these groups — you're
why this year-end review was written in March!

SAB thanks students

Dear Fellow Students,

The members of the SAB wish to thank those of you who
cooperated with us in recovering the Man-in-the-Moon and one:of
the I Love NY signs. Both were returned by last weekend —
anonymously. The other sign and the moon's spoon are still at large
and rumored far beyond the “W&L community.’ We intend to
track them down as well.

Thanks again!

 

Sincerely,
Doug Jackson

Letters To The Editor

Election and library problems discussed

Dear Editor:

The student government elections which
were held this past Monday are a clear il-
lustration of a growing problem which makes
a mockery of any electoral process.

Any election in which there are three major
positions to be selected and only two can-
didates on the ballot demonstrates that the
students do not believe that their efforts
through student government will substantial-
ly change the welfare of their college ex-
perience.

The University’s position is stated clearly
in the catalog: ‘‘the faculty and ad-
ministrative officials give organizations of
student government full cooperation and sup-
port in the discharge of their respon-
sibilities.”

The only problem with this statement is
that it implies that the students wield a much
greater latitude of influence than is actually
true.

Mike Gallagher’s sandbox analogy (last
year) seems to be particularly true in light of
the developments this year between the town
and the fraternities. The town and the ad-
ministration allow the students ‘‘to discharge
their responsibilities” within the confines of
the sandbox, but the mouse traps snare any
student who ventures outside those hallowed
walls.

This lack of real influence may be a
primary reason for the student apathy in the
latest EC election.

Sincerely,
Mike Foley

Dear Editor:

We would like to bring to light a rather an-
noying aspect about the new multi-million
dollar undergraduate library. Despite the
fact thatthere are numerous doors along the
right side of the building and elaborate con-
crete walkways and stairways leading to
these doors which must have cost thousands
of dollars, the only entrance and exit to the
building is the main one on the top level. This
is a considerable and néedless inconvenience
for students coming up from Woods Creek
especially.

The argument that the front entrance by the
main desk should be the only access so the
library staff can watch for unchecked
material leaving the building is absurd. The
honor system is supposed to make such polic-
ing procedures unnecessary at this Universi-
ty. And, unless the staff frisked everyone on
the way out, any security measures designed
to detect easily concealable reading material
would be ridiculously inefficient. It’s our
library and everyone should have plenty of
access to it, especially the students in Woods
Creek who had to put up with the blasting, the
rock drills, and the constant din of construc-
tion for three years.

More Letters To The Editor

Pleas For Dance Marathon

Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter as a last ditch effort
to try and get people to dance in Washington
and Lee’s Muscular Dystrophy Dance
Marathon.

It is the first time that something like this
has been tried and there is no reason in the
world why this marathon should not be suc-
cessful. We have given away over 200 in-
formation packets, but as of now only about
twenty people have signed up to dance. If you
plan to dance and have not returned your
registration form to Carole Chappell’s office,
please do so immediately so we can better
plan for food, etc. for the dancers.

I have worked, since October, harder on
this project than anything else in my life. I
have had tremendous help from a great
number of people but all this work will be for
naught if not enough decide to dance. We have
good bands lined up, great prizes, and free
food and beer for dancers. The Dance
Marathon Committee has tried to make it as

tempting as possible for people to take part in
the Muscular Dystrophy Dance Marathon.

But, put partying and prizes and free food
and beer aside for a moment and look at the
cause. Muscular Dystrophy affects children
mainly and many times the person will not
live past the age of thirty. Of course it
depends on the type of dystrophy, but no mat-
ter, it still attacks and cripples many people.
The search is under way for the cure to this
disease and one type of fund raiser that has
brought in a great deal of money is a dance
marathon.

Syracuse University has raised $42,000.
Virginia Tech has raised $20,000. All I am ask-
ing for is $5,000. It can be done but not without
the aid of people willing to dance. Please, if
for no one else, dance for those who can’t.

Thank you,

Jay Blumberg

Chairman, Muscular Dystrophy Dance
Marathon

 

Dear Editor:

Please make note that the Grand Prize for
the Muscular Dystrophy Dance-a-thon is a
trip for the winning couple, not individual, to
Walt Disney World in Florida. The trip will
take place during a three-day weekend in
May, and will be sponsored by Eastern
Airlines, Muscular Dystrophy, and Holiday
Inns, Inc. The trip would normally cost ap-
proximately $400.00, including plane fare,
tickets at Disney Worid, and hotel ac-
commodations., All expenses are pre-paid.
Certain couples have already found enough
sponsors to make their odds of winning very

good. Other dancers still have time to get

enough signatures so that they have a chance

of winning. Of course, the amount of time ac-

tually danced is an important factor. Good

luck to all dancers; your efforts will in the end

prove that apathy is not synonymous with

W&L. The money you raise may help a child

out of his wheelchair; that’s really what this
is all about.

Another thousand dollars that
was budgeted for coins was not

The company contracted to
manufacture the coins refunded
the SAB’s money because the
coins could not be produced in

time for the Ball, Ridge said.

He added that several Fancy
Dress workers had not yet been
paid for their labors.

Although the entire Fancy
Dress bill has not been figured
down to the penny, it seems ap-
parent that a large profit will be
made by the SAB on this year’s
Ball.

Inspections March 29

The Judicial Board of the In-
terfraternity fined the Pi Kappa
Alpha Fraternity for violating
the city noise ordinance on Fan-
cy Dress weekend.

Pika received a warning
because their band was playing
too loud at 12:30 Sunday morn-
ing, according to president
Frank Ellerbe.

When police told Pika the
band was too loud, the fraterni-
ty had the band stop playing.

Tapes were put on and were
playing when police arrived and
issued a summons at 1:30.

IFC President Jim Davis
said, ‘‘We decided to fine you
(Pika ) $50 because you did get a
warning and because we want
to discourage other fraternities
from violating the noise or-
dinance.”’

The summons was Pika’s
first of the year. Represen-
tatives from Pika will appear in
court on March 27th.

The IFC also announced that
fraternities should turn in their
monthly checklist on March 27

74. Vie Monday
For Class Offices

by David Greer

The student body Executive
Committee received 73 petitions
for class officer elections. (For
the names of candidates, see the
sample ballot on page 2.)

Daniel Carucci announced
that he is running for Senior
Class Vice President-Science as
a write-in candidate.

The campaigning is
restricted to a $10 spending
limit, 15 posters at any one time
(no more than five on the Colon-
nade), and one banner.
Freshman posters are
restricted to the dorms and
Evans Dining Hall.

Elections will be held Monday

 

Student Poll

The Ring-tum Phi will con-
duct a student opinion poll Mon-
day during the elections for
class officers and EC represen-
tatives.

The poll will be at the various
polling places around the cam-
pus and will deal with issues
pertinent to the student body.

We urge all students to spend
the two minutes it will take to
fill out the questionnaire and let
their opinion be counted.

 

 

 

and run-offs will be Thursday.

In other business, the Student
Actitities Board said that there
was a profit of about $1,900 from
Fancy Dress.

The SAB saved money on the
Thursday night entertainment,
the Vandales, and on not being
able to have coins minted this
year, SAB treasurer Bill Ridge
said.

The profit will goto a Spring’s
Weekend concert, the SAB
hopes. The SAB has about
$18,000 to spend on the weekend.

One SAB member said that
there is a chance that the con-
cert might be Jimmy Buffet and
The Pussette-Dart Band, but
that is not definite.

Freshman Stuart Miller
presented to the EC a petition to
have cheerleaders from area
girls’ schools perform at foot-
ball and lacrosse games.

Stuart Body president Beau
Dudley said that he thought
there ought to be W&L students
on the team too.

Senior EC representative Rob
Calvert said that cheerleaders
in the past “caught so much
shit” that the problem would
‘not be in getting them, but
keeping them.”

Miller said that in the past

McCarthy

McCarthy, Rusher Debate

American life.

“The voluntary army was a
mistake,’’ former Sen. Eugene
McCarthy told a large audience
last night in Washington and
Lee University’s Lee Chapel.

McCarthy’s support for
reinstituting some form of
draft system to supplement the
present all volunteer military
was one of the few issues on
which the former senator
agreed with William A. Rusher,
the conservative publisher with
whom he debated various pro-
blems currently confronting the
United States.

“It will take a liberal, not me,
to assure you that there will not
be a draft ever again,’’ Rusher
had said before McCarthy
spoke.

Most of Rusher’s comments
on foreign policy centered on
building an ‘‘adequate and suf-
ficient’’ defense. ‘“‘We must
have a proper defense of this
country against external
threats,” he said.

Rusher implied that the
Soviet Union was the United
States’ chief adversary in the
international arena and that the
U.S.S.R. had won many Third
World countries over to their
side in the past ten years.

McCarthy against overarm-
ing in response to preceived
foreign threats and questioned
talk of ‘the missile gap.”

“The Russians have 5,000
horses in their army and we on-

Lexington, Virginia,

March 22, 1979

ly have 29 and they primarily
pull caissons in Arlington
cemetary,’’ McCarthy said in
mock comparison to the
“missile gap” argument.

“There is never enough
security,’’ McCarthy said. “If
we can destroy the Russians
with two percent (of the United
States’ nuclear capabilities),
then what are we going to do
with the other 98 percent?”’

‘*Each branch of defense feels
the need to have enough
firepower to destroy the world
and each other,’ McCarthy
said. ‘‘We are overarmed in
terms of nuclear weapons.”

Rusher disagreed.

‘It is irresponsible to suggest
that the number of missiles on
one nuclear submarine will suc-
cessfully destroy five cities,’ he
said in response to McCarthy's
charge of defense overarma-
ment. ‘‘Maybe it (the sub-
marine) won't. Maybe the sub
will sink. Maybe it will miss.”’

Rusher said that he had not
heard it said anywhere that the
United States had enough
nuclear fire power to “totally
destroy’’ Russia.

In domestic affairs, the
former U.S. Senator from Min-
nesota and the conservative
publisher and columnist again
disagreed on the effectiveness
of federal regulatory agencies
and the amount of government
involvement necessary in

NUMBER 21

 

Rusher

Rusher used the recent
deregulation of the airlines and
the resulting lower fares as a
positive example of govern-
ment deregulation of industry.

But McCarthy said that the
lower fares had just encouraged
more people to fly during the
current energy crisis. He said
that the increase in airline
passengers has resulted in one
billion gallons more fuel being
used than when the airlines
were under federal regulation.

Rusher said that the expan-
sion of government under
‘liberal’ politicians has
resulted in the difficulties that
will face the United States in the
1980s.

‘We have tried liberalism
and we got the imperial
presidency, we got the welfare
rip-off, and we got the bankrupt
cities in the Northeast,’’ Rusher
said. “We have trifled once with
double digit inflation and it
looks as if we will again.”’

He said that California’s Pro-
position 13 indicated a strong
sentiment throughout the na-
tion, ‘not just a budget balanc-
ing impulse,’ but as a new

Concert
Meeting

The Student Activities Board
will hold further discussions on
the selection of a band to play
for Spring Concert at two
meetings: Thursday, March 22,
at 5 p.m., and Sunday, March
25, at 7:30 p.m. The meetings
will be held in the SAB office in
the student center. All SAB
meetings are “open,” and in-
terested members of the stu-
dent body are invited to attend
to express their opinions.

Foster Named To

Student Recruitment

by David Greer

Jay Foster was named co-
chairman of the student recruit-
ment committee, in an an-
nouncement obtained by the Phi
this week.

Foster, a junior from Ab-
ington, Pa., will serve next year

    
       
   
     

463-3013 or 463-9400

with Charles Terry.

Foster was chosen from eight
applicants by the present co-
chairmen, Bill Thistlethwaite

tor of Admissions William Har-
tog and admissions counsellors
Mark Putney and Jim
Underhill.

The co-chairman are respon-
sible for scheduling tours for
prospective students and for
Honor Week activities. The
committee itself, founded by a
group of present seniors and ad-
missions officials in 1976, aims
at promoting the image of the
University among prospective
students by bringing them into
contact with interested — up-
perclassmen.

Hartog said that he was ‘‘ex-
tremely pleased’’ to have
Foster selected.

‘“Jay’s background, his _in-
volvement in other activities on
campus, his willingness to
‘spread the word’ were _in-
strumental in our selection,”
Hartog said.

The Guardsman: A four-star success

by Parker Potter

Lee Kahn’s The Guardsman
is just what this theatre season
needed. Near the end of a
season which has tended to be
experimental and somewhat
unsatisfying — along comes this
gem, cut and polished by Kahn
and everyone associated with
the production.

Even before the orange cur-
tain rises the viewer is sent on
his way to Budapest by the
Chopin piano piece which we
learn is being played by Ilona in
her living room. The curtain
opens on all the main
characters, Ilona (Betty Kahn)
and her husband Nandor (Grant
Kunkowski) both actors.

Present as well are Bela
(Kurt Kammerer) and Mother
(Ginger McNeese), both friends
of the newly married couple. In
a verybally dazzling opening
scene the sorry state of Ilona
and Nandor’s six-month mar-

riage is deftly articulated
against Tom Ziegler’s
marvelous set.

The rapport between costume
and scene in The Guardsman is
remarkable. In the first scene
the ever-constant Bela wears a
coat which probably matches
the wallpaper while Nandor in
his red smoking jacket stands
out against the pastels of the
room, as the spectacle that he
is.

The coherence of the sets and
the costumes to the sense of the
play is paralleled by the
coherence of the acting.
Molnar’s play operates on a
number of levels, each inex-

tricably tied to the rest. As
noted above, Ilona and Nandor
are actors. One level of inter-
pretation asks whether and
when, each has stepped out
from behind a theatrical pose.
Kunkowski is particularly

adept at slipping in an out of the
characters of Nandor. Like
Nandor, Kunkowski has a com-
mand of many roles at once. His
Nandor is completely distinct
from his Guardsman. Yet, at
these moments when Nandor

shines through the Guardsman
character, Kunkowski always
has a firm hand on the rudder.
Kunkowski has a presence not
unlike that of Taylor Harbison.
The whole play is in his eyes. He

Love Beach
Emerson, Lake & Palmer

At the risk of angering the
rabid ELP-haters in Musical
Mainstream’s __ readership,
there’s something that needs to
be said at the beginning of this
review: Love Beach is not
pretentious.” The same is true,
for that matter, of most of the
band’s recorded work. Preten-
sion is an attitude toward one’s
music and one’s fans; it is nota
musical style. Many of the
music-buyers and critics who
condemn ELP’s_ extended,
keyboard-oriented pieces as
pretentious would very likely
rave about Lou Reed’s self-
indulgent sixteen minute
monologue masquerading as
‘“‘Walk on the Wild Side”’ (on the
Take No Prisoners album)...or
Devo’s theory on the role of de-
evolution in the social develop-
ment of mankind (ya wanna run
that one by me one more time,
fellas? ). That’s pretentious.

front of the typewriter for ages
trying to figure out how to
describe the record’s sheer
awfulness, and I’m afraid I'll
have to take the easy way out —
person by person.

Greg Lake has always been
ELP’s weak link. His guitar
playing is passable at best, and
his songwriting talents are vast-
ly overrated. Sure, he’s written
some great ones — “Lucky
Man” and ‘“‘From the Beginn-
ing,’ to name just two. He’s
also been re-writing the same
basic material since day one
(somebody ought to tell this guy
there’s more to life than love
songs). Lake has been blessed
with a great voice, which he’s
always used to its full ad-
vantage in concert and on
record...until now. His phrasing
and intonation on Love Beach
are poor indeed, and the lyrics
are downright painful in places

dodging and shifting into and
out of characters. Kunkowski is
always in control of a character
who could either back down an
actor — or run away with him.

Kunkowski is excellent — but
the other players shine too. Bet-
ty Kahn’s Ilona is an ambiguous
delight. With Ilona — one never
quite knows.

She says she’s not taken in by
Nandor’s Guardsman — but
what do we make of her
“confession” to Bela — her
statement of the Guardsman’s
masculine magnificence? What
do we make of the light Mother
sees in Ilona’s eyes — the
sparkle of love? And the final
stroke is Ilona’s stroll to the
window which closes the play.

We are deliberately left hang-
ing. And Betty Kahn weaves
together all the diverse threads
which make up Ilona. She is the
perfect foil (but much more
than a foil) to Kunkowski. All
the playing and posing that
Nandor does loudly, Ilona, also
an actor, does in her own quiet
way. And Kahn doesn’t let that
slip away.

The part of Bela is done am-
ple justice by Kurt Kammerer.
Insightful but not sharp, good
natured and ever attentive,
Bela is exactly the kind of man
who by virtue of his tempera-
ment is perfectly suited to be a
friend of this family. Just as he

Foster’s goal gives W&L win

Generals escape

near disaster in
8-7 thriller...

by Doug Linton

Some 1000 sunbathers looked
on as the Generals nipped the
Battling Bishops of Ohio
Wesleyan by a score of 8-7 in
overtime at Wilson Field on
Tuesday. Jay Foster had the
game-winning shot with 2:56
gone in the first four minute
overtime period.

Both teams started out very
sloppily. This set the pace for
the entire game, as it was long,
sloppy, slow and dull. Loose
dogs running out onto the field
seemed to be more entertaining
than the squads battling out on
the playing area.

Ohio Wesleyan’s first goal
was a fluke. General keeper
Bob Clements carried the ball
out over the restraining line in
an attempt to clear, but his pass
was intercepted at midfield.
Rick Boyle then shot into an
open goal to give the Battling
Bishops a 1-0 lead. John Black
finally tied it at 1-1 as he took a
Sandy McDonald pass with 6:53
left in the first period. But it on-
ly took OW 21 seconds to answer
that goal, giving the Bishops a
2-1 edge at the end of the first
period.

The second quarter was more
than half over before John
Kemp netted one of the
Generals two ‘‘man-up”’ goals
to tie the game at 2. The other
other goal in the period was also
“man-up” with Mike Pressler
feeding foster. Foster used good
judgement, electing to back up
and take a more controlled shot,
rather than go for the
quickstick. The Generals led 3-2
at the half.

It took Ohio Wesleyan about
one minute into the second half
to tie the score at 3-3. Jeff Fritz
then responded with two
straight unassisted tallies.
After four games, Fritz is
averaging two goals per outing.
These two scores made it 5-3 in
favor of the Generals at the end
of the third quarter.

Ohio Wesleyan’s fourth goal
came at 12:50 — when they
were a man-down. As_ the
Bishops continued to get psych-
ed, Geoff Brent put one in,
unassisted, to make it 6-4,
Generals. Next, OW had a two-
on-one_ situation against
Clements and it was 6-5. Brent
again responded with his se-
cond unassisted tally of the
game to widen the margin to 7-5
for W&L. OW put one more in at
4:07, making it 7-6, and began

thinking realistically about an
upset. Their psyche was over-
whelming to the seemingly
passive Generals. OW then
scored a second man-down
goal, tying the score at 7-7 with
2:39 left in regulation time.

Netmen outmatched in Div. I

by Nat Lovell

On Saturday, March 17, the
Generals lost to a_ visiting
Morehead State Team.
Morehead, a Division I school,
had recruited its top five
players from England with the
sixth coming from Sweden. The
dominated the singles, taking
advantage of what turned out of
be a bad day for some of the
W&L netmen.

At number one singles,
Stewart Jackson lost in three
sets to Richard Leslie 3-6, 6-4,
6-3. Shaw Cranfield turned in a
powerful performance in
beating Dhan Shapurgi 6-3, 6-3,
for the Generals’ only singles
victory. Number three Doug
Gaker went down to Nick Lee
6-3, 6-2. Dave Constine felt he
had “played well,”’ but never-
theless, fell to Philip King 6-2,
6-2. At number four, Pat Norris
could not keep up with the
heavy topspin shots of Martin
Watts and was defeated 6-3, 6-0.
In the final singles match, Wes
Yonge lost a close match to the
swift Swede, Eric Nyberg, 6-4,
6-4.

In doubles, Jackson and Cran-
field lost to Leslie and Shapurgi
in two close sets 7-5, 6-3. The se-
cond doubles team of Gaker and
Constine lost in two sets also,

6-4, 6-4. The last match of the

“day came to a conclusion in a

tense tie-breaker, unfortunately

it went the other way for the
Generals, as Norris and Yonge
lost to Watts and Nyberg, 5-7,
6-2, 7-6.

The following Monday, March
19, the netmen road-tripped to
the University of South Carolina
only to meet defeat in a match
of many tie-breakers — most of
which went in USC’s favor.

Number one, Stewart
Jackson should be commended
for a fine effort against highly
regarded Chris Mayotte (rank-
ed No. 1 in New England
juniors). Jackson did lose,
however, 7-6, 6-3. Shaw Cran-
field was dealt his first loss of
the season at the hands of Bob
Detrich in a very close match
7-6, 7-6. In the absence of Doug
Gaker, Dave Constine moved
into the third slot and fell victim
to Barry Gilbert 6-1, 6-1. Wes
Yonge lost a close match to
David Kramer 7-5, 6-2. Bob
Schuler saw his first varsity
playing time of the season in his
loss to Dru Kefalos 6-1, 6-0.
Sumner Bouldin filled in for the
final singles match but lost 6-1,
6-2.

In doubles, the number one
team of Jackson and Cranfield

saved a little face for the
netmen in beating Kramer and

these matches, one does well to

Syracuse in

10-7 contest

by Doug Linton

The Varsity Lacrosse team
dropped a very important early
season game to the Orangemen
of Syracuse by a score of 10-7
Saturday at Wilson Field. The
team came out on the short end
by the end of the day, but things
could have been a lot different.

The beginning of the game
was incredible. Within 1:36 into
the first quarter, the score was
already 2-2; it looked like the
beginning of a high scoring con-
test. But this was not to be the
case. After George Santos and
Jeff Fritz opened the scoring for
the Generals and tied the game,
both defenses settled down. The
only other shot to hit its mark in
the quarter, came off the stick
of John Black with only 2:53 left
in the period to give W&L a 3-2
lead. This turned out to be the
one and only time the Generals
held the edge throughout the en-
tire game.

In the second quarter the
fans, some 3500 had to sit and
watch as their Generals were
shut out. It turned out to be
quite a long period as the only
scoring was three goals for the
Orangemen, giviing Syracuse a
5-3 halftime lead. Any momen-
tum W&L had seemed to be
disappearing. But both defenses
looked very tough at this point.

This sharp defense continued
for the first five minutes of the
second half. One lapse gave
Syracuse another goal at 11:49,
but Fritz answered with his se-
cond tally of the game (and
sixth of the season) to make it
6-4. From this point on, the
Generals never got any closer
than two. The Orangemen went
on to score three more goals to
give them a 9-4 lead at the end

such close matches. (comtinued on page 5)

Trackmen surprise Davidson
with 74-71 road victory

by Greg Branan

“We ran extremely well,”
were the words of track coach
Norris Aldridge in response to
last Saturday’s dual meet vic-
tory over Davidson College.

The final score was close with
W&L edging Davidson 74-71.
Last year Davidson beat the
Generals by one point. Coach
Aldridge’s prediction of a close
meet was proved as W&L led by
only five points with two events
left, the mile relay and triple
jump. The Generals’ Norvell
Scott took third in the triple
jump while the relay team of
Billy Morris, Dave Cordell,
Stewart Atkinson, and Jack
Norberg won the mile relay.

“Basically, it was just a good
team effort,” added Aldridge.

Top performances included
surprise first and second places

in the 1500 meters by Rich Bird
and Chris Daniel. Daniel
returned to take first in the 800
meters. The Generals swept the
400 meter race with Billy Mor-
ris, Jim Parker, and Dave Cor-
dell, respectively. W&L took
first and second in the pole
vault with Baker Spring and
Bob Campbell taking the
honors.

In other field events Buz Man-
ning was a surprising first in
the discus with a throw of over
130 feet. Also, in his first meet
throwing the javelin, Randy
Austin took second with a throw
of over 162 feet. Scott Swope
placed third in the javelin. Phil
Dunlay placed third in the shot
put. Norvell Scott placed second
in the long jump, while Paul
Hendry placed third in the high
jump.

In other running events the

440 yard relay team of Jeff
Brown, Chris Leiser, Atkinson
and Norberg won. Norberg also
placed first in the 100 meter
dash and first in the 200 meters.
Atkinson took third in the 200.
Russ Rector placed third in the
110 high hurdles, second in the
400 intermediate hurdles and
second in the high jump. Jim
Vines placed third in the 400
meter intermediate hurdles.

Coach Aldridge added that
“improvements are starting in
the throwing and distance race
events.”

This Friday the Generals
travel to Emory and Henry for
a meet that afternoon. In look-
ing ahead, Coach Aldridge said,
“It’s going to be another close
meet. They’re strong in the field
events, have one good sprinter
and a 440 man. They’re loaded
in almost every event.”

goal came with only four
seconds left.

_It took three minutes for
Syracuse to get one more goal,
their last of the day. Jay Foster
responded at 8:21 for the

Generals win

(continued from page 4)

Jerry Broccoli recovered a
crucial ground ball and was
slashed with only 0:17 left, giv-
ing the Generals possession and
a man-up situation. Coach Em-
mer was content to just let the
clock run down, as the penalty
would carry over into overtime.

Fritz, Kemp, Foster and
Pressler passed the ball around
the perimeter of the defense
trying to work a shot as the first
sudden-death overtime period
began. But Foster was later
pushed into the crease; before
he could jump back out the
referee had blown his whistle
and the bail belonged to OW at
3:40. Both teams were now at
full strength.

With about 2:00 left, Broccoli
knocked the ball loose from a
Bishop attackman and W&L
recovered in their own half of
the field. After a successful
clear at 1:48, the Generals
began working the ball again. at
1:04 Black squeaked a pass into
Foster who was waiting in the
crease to fire it home, giving
W&L the 8-7 victory.

Ohio Wesleyan outshot W&L,
46-40, and also recovered 65
groundballs to the Generals’ 55.
It seemed that the ball was
loose for most of the day. W&L
capitalized on 2 of 9 man-up
situations, and turned away
both attempts by the Bishops.
The Generals failed 15 of 38
clearing attempts, while OW
failed only 12 of 32. This victory
brings the Generals up to 3-1 on
the season. :

Clements, save for his early
mistake, looked good. He stop-
ped 16 of the Bishops’ 46 shots.
Both goalies can be credited
with keeping the score as low as
it was.

George Santos also looked
good as he dazzled a few of his
opponents with some excellent
stickwork and moves.

Foster was injured for the
Generals and will not see action
against North Carolina on
Saturday. He reinjured one
ankle and sprained the other.

to Syracuse

Generals, assisted by Geoff
Brent’ making it 10-5. Black
then hit again to net his second
of the day. 10-6, Syracuse. As
the fans were filing out, John
Kemp took a Mike Pressler
pass and drilled it home to com-
plete the day’s scoring at 10-7.

_ But it could have been a lot
different.

Six times the Generals miss-
ed goals by hitting the pipe.
Another key factor was that
W&L was penalized 7 times for
5:30, while Syracuse was only
called twice for 1:30. Although
the Generals can _ pride
themselves on turning away all
7 man-down attempts, this is at
least 5% minutes which couldn’t
be spent trying to score. It is
tough to do a good job with an
offense if your backs are con-
stantly against the wall!

Most of the statistics were
pretty grim. Besides losing all
four faceoffs, the Generals were
outshot 44-29 and beat on ground
balls, 39-27.

The worst stat was the clears.
W&L failed 11 of 30 attempts,
while Syracuse was successful
in 27 of their 31 tries. This was
due mainly to some very un-
characteristic sloppy passing,
and pressure from the
Orangemen.

W&L goalie Bob Clements
was simply shelled. He did
manage to save 22 of the 32
shots that were on goal, and at
least 10 of these saves were
point-black, with 7 coming in
the fourth quarter. Clements
clearly kept the Generals in the
game.

The Generals defense, so
often gone unnoticed, did a very
good job on the whole. Both
Steven Johnson and Jim
Herbert had fine days, but ran
into trouble each time they gave
their man an inch. The
Orangemen came in swarms
and took advantage of each inch
that the Generals gave them.
Syracuse did score 10 goals, but
most of the game they were
forced to keep their passes out
on the permimeter and out by
the restraining line.

WE&L ninth in poll

The Washington and Lee
Generals were ranked ninth in
the nation according to

Division Lacrosse Poll of this

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Apathy in retreat?

Last Monday, the E.C. room was jammed with people. Every
inch of space was taken, as people spilled into the hallway and
voices strained to be heard above the crowd. Was it another ‘‘Spin-
ners controversy,’’ the rock vs. soul battle that raged here three
years ago? Hardly...For the first time in recent memory, students
of all classes turned out in force to announce their candidacy for
class office. Seventy-three in all, their interest and enthusiasm
should make next week’s elections among the most exciting ever
seen at W&L. Our best wishes to all the candidates — it seems stu-
dent interest wasn’t dead, but merely dozing. -

And speaking of interest, participation in the Dance Marathon
has jumped in the past week. Some students have reported several
hundred dollars in pledges individually, so the first year goal of
$5,000 is certainly within sight. Even so, we strongly urge all non-
dancers to attend the event — including faculty and staff. For a
mere $5, those 30 hours of entertainment can’t be beat.

The committee in charge of the Marathon has worked long hours
since September on this project. But their success is totally depen-
dent on the community. So make this cause good! — the effort
necessary is small...

Wisdom from Tinker Mountain

I call your attention to the editorial at the right, which appeared
in a recent issue of Hollins Columns. While Ms. Mahlum certainly
deserves applause for her concern, I believe there are some fun-
damental misconceptions in her article which should be cleared up.

Above all, though I’ve never gotten a definite quote on the sub-
ject, I feel reasonably certain that President Huntley has never
stayed up nights (a la Dean Wormer), plotting the destruction of
the fraternity system. Neither does he indulge in cheap threats. Ms.
Mahlum accuses him of refusing to believe in the self-government
of fraternities. Yet that is the precise reason why he has not attend-
ed IFC meetings in past years. Not “‘lack of interest’’ but trust is
the factor here. I might also suggest that — even though the Hollins
president may have no more pressing affairs to handle than student
social problems — it would frighten me a little to think that our
president had that much time on his hands. In addition, Ms.
Mahlum should remember that most colleges have deans
(remember them?) to deal with everyday student life.

Also, the point should be made that the fraternity system is not in
reed of improvement, strictly speaking. As it appears on paper, in
the IFC rules, the system is just fine. But fraternities are not carry-
ing out all these necessary requirements. ‘Financial management,
social conduct, and house upkeep”’ are not “‘improvements”’ — they
ure expected.

Finally, I ask that Ms. Mahlum remember that fraternities —
though an important part of campus life — are not official universi-
ty organizations. Only when they begin to affect the campus direct-
ly and in an adverse way is the administration justified in taking
direct action. Comparing our social clubs to the dorms at Hollins is
both unfair and ludicrous. Let me assure all critics that W&L
students continue to govern themselves in campus affairs to the
same degree as Hollins students.

Fraternity members — read Ms. Mahlum’s editorial closely.
Some of her arguments may be misplaced, but her general tone in-

dicates a genuine concern that only you can help to bring to an vod

Hollins Columns editor comments
on Huntley’s message to fraternities

The following is an editorial
from the March 12 issue of Hollins
Columns.

Since fraternity social life af-
fects many members of the Col-
lege, it seems appropriate to
consider both what Washington
and Lee President Robert E.R.
Huntley said and, indeed, what
he did not say in his recent ad-
dress to the W&L Interfraterni-
ty Council.

Huntley described frater-
nities at W&L as, ‘‘the core of
social life’ for students there,
but added ‘‘not as a threat’”’ and
“time is about to run out on the
fraternity system, and for a cer-
tain few fraternities in par-
ticular.’ Why does he offer such
a sweeping statement, ‘‘as a
prediction’? Has he ventured to
think beyond threats and in-
stead wants to see the end of the
fraternity system? Perhaps
since it was not a threat, he did
not want to address the question
of what the W&L administration
will do to get rid of the fraterni-
ty system. However, Huntley
did not offer any suggestions on
how the fraternity system could
be improved. He offered ideas
on where improvements need to
be made, ‘‘financial manage-
ment, social conduct, and struc-
tural or house upkeep,”’ but no
ways which he thought these
areas could be improved.

Huntley asked, ‘‘Do you think
fraternities have the capability
for self-government?’ One
must wonder if he believes they
do. He also placed no blame for
the “overall deterioration of
fraternities” on the University,
yet he stated that it has been
“seven or eight years since I
last met with this group” (the
W&L IFC). His lack of interest
in the IFC seems to be a strong
indicator that some blame
should be placed on the Univer-
sity for the ‘‘deterioration of the
fraternities.”’

 

Huntley’s attitude in general
seems a bit amazing. He
describes the ‘‘youthful ex-
uberance” of fraternities and
later alludes to the time at W&L
as the “transition between
boyhood and manhood’’ in
stressing the importance of
fraternity life. I find it hard to
visualize ‘‘youthful ex-
uberance” and manhood in the
same light. How does he see
these males, as men or boys?

In addition to the interest of
W&L and its problems, it is in-
teresting to look at our own Col-
lege in comparison. Although
there are no sororities at the
College, indeed they were
abolished by students in 1929, a
comparison about how students
are considered in self govern-
ment can be made.

I find that we are taken
seriously here in our social and
dorm life. Students govern and
continue to govern in the Com-
munity Trust System at the Col-
lege. By being wholly student
run in these areas, we are
trusted to make fair and
“adult”’ decisions concerning
our peers, Students are offered
and take the responsibility for
each other. The administration
does not wait seven or eight
years before voicing concern
about student conduct, this of-
fers open communication bet-
ween student and administra-
tion members. No one is hiding
behind a tree, fearing the
resolution of a problem.

(Reprinted with permission from the Lexington News-Gazette,

March 14, 1979)

Housing is again coming to the fore as a need that is not being

adequately met in this area.

All three of the rent-subsidized housing developments in the Lex-
ington area are reported to have waiting lists. The developer of one
of these complexes is considering additional units. But no such con-
sideration by the other groups has surfaced.

Meanwhile, only one of the three area governing bodies,
Rockbridge County, has elected to participate in the federal-state
rental assistance program which aids low income families in
upgrading the level of their housing.

The housing problem: involves the university, as the student
newspaper, the Ring-tum Phi, recently documented in.a special

housing section.

With relatively little on-campus housing available for upper
classmen, students are increasingly vying with local families for
housing. The rooms in private houses, which once provided ac-
commodations for many students, are found to be inadequate for

today’s lifestyles.

The community’s leaders need to again turn increased attention

to the housing situation.

Housing Booklet
In The Making

Sophomore student Executive
Committee representative Bob
Willis is completing work on a
student housing booklet.

Willis, who has been involved
in student housing problems
since the time that the Ring-
tum Phi began its investigation
of the situation, says his booklet
will be printed by the Universi-
ty this summer and will be
distributed to students next fall.

The booklet itself will be an
expanded version of the
newspaper’s Student Housing
Supplement. ‘‘After the Ring-
tum Phi’s housing issue, the
University has made definite
steps toward providing an off-
campus housing service,”’
Willis said.

He has spoken with both
James W. Whitehead, Universi-
ty treasurer, and William N.
Mohler, director of University
Services, about student  off-
campus housing problems and
said that Mohler now has a

bulletin board in his office for
housing information.

Willis is also hopeful about
starting a file of private apart-
ments and houses which are
usually occupied by students.
He encourages students now liv-
ing in off-campus housing to
leave their names and
telephone numbers in Carole
Chappell’s office in the Univer-
sity Center so that work can
begin on the file.

“Proposition 13. means the
people want to get their hands
around the necks of the politi-
cians who have been ruining
this country,’’ Rusher said.

McCarthy, on the other hand,
blamed most of the United
States’ domestic troubles on
‘our banks, financial institu-
tions’ and corporations.”

He concentrated most of his
attack on the automobile and
advertising industries.

“When you buy a Chrysler,
you are paying them back about
$200 for telling you to buy the
car in the first place,’’ McCar-
thy said. He accused the
automobile industry of

“‘wasting”’ $100 million a year.

McCarthy also said that ‘‘the
American economy is not going
to absorb the unemployed’ in
the U.S. and recommended a
“redistribution”’ of the existing
work.

“If we just distributed the
overtime work, we could
employ another one million peo-
ple,” he said.

During the question and
answer period following the for-
mal debate, Rusher endorsed
former California Gov. Ronald
Reagon as the Republican par-
ty’s presidential candidate for
1980. He said that former Texas

The list of flaws in this LP

a job well done. Mother is
“mother” to Ilona, though not
biologically. The connection is
somewhat less than clear —
mother is some sort of live-in
friend of the family who does do
windows. The fact is_ that
McNeese plays a woman who
(like so many others) is herself
playing a role. Indicative of
MecNeese’s intelligent, witty
performance is the fact that
even while she’s practically off
stage and certainly not speak-
ing in Act II, she (McNeese)
continues to act. Sitting in the
box, she really does watch the

opera. ;
The three domestics all do

‘their jobs. Rob Davis and Laura

Tilley are proficient and some
of Shirley Hughes’ facial ex-
pressions are priceless,

Lee Kahn deserves baskets
full of good words for his direc-
tion. In this play, timing,
nuance and ambiance are ter-
ribly important. Without a firm
directional hand — this fine
script could easily slip away.

In Kahn’s production, I find
that each line that I would have
underlined while reading the
play is meaninfully accen-
tuated. All the levels of plot and
tone are supported by a superb
sense of what’s going on.

In this manner the wildly
comic and profoundly serious
are allowed to co-exist in the
play (as they do in life).

Finally, The Guardsman
doesn’t give us an answer.
Because of Kahn’s masterful
direction, we don’t ask it to. In
Molnar’s Budapest, tissued
with lies told by women, peopl-
ed by actors — the one certainty
is that there is no certainty. And
we have been. prepared to ac-
cept that.

The Guardsman is a
coherent, unified expression of
the disjointed world around us.
All aspects of the play — the
music, the settings, the acting
— all work to this end. The
Guardsman is an unqualified
four-star credit to all involved.

Dance Marathon Raises $17,000

Three Times More Than Expected Given To Fight Muscular Dystrophy

by David Greer

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s first annual .Muscular
Dystrophy Dance Marathon
grossed $17,052 last weekend,
according to chairman Jay
Blumberg.

Blumberg, who had set the
original goal at $5,000, said that
the results “‘were beyond my
wildest expectations.”

Sophomore Dean Kalamaras
raised the most money in
pledges, bringing in $3,020. In
doing so, he won. a trip to
Disneyworld, which he donated
to MD with the stipulation that
the trip be given to a child
whohas muscular dystrophy.

Blumberg said that about 65
dancers started in the
marathon and about 60 finished.
Their pledges totoal about
$15,000. He expects about a 98
percent collection return.

Blumberg said that there was
much participation from Sweet-
briar and Randolph-Macon Col-
leges, and some from Southern
Seminary Junior College.

The marathon brought in
money other than from pledges.
Fraternities donated beer and
nearly all the fraternities gave
money. Fraternity donations
totaled about $1,400.

Money from admission total-

Only four or five contestants
participated in the wet T-shirt

Blumberg said that Saturday
night was the most crowded and
that 25 kegs of beer were emp-
tied during the marathon.

Blumberg said that most of
the pledges were small pledges
from students, and that the
community and parents were
not ‘‘hit hard” for pledges. The
largest single pledge. was for
about $200.

Virginia Tech also raised
$17,000 at its first marathon, but
had about 700 dancers,
Blumberg said. Old Dominion
University has raised the most
money in the state with a total
of $24,000.

None of them come close to

-reaching the per dancer total of

$240 achieved at
Blumberg said.

Blumberg said that there
definitely will be another dance
marathon next year, and hopes
that it will be ‘‘the second major
event of the winter.”’

“This has restored my faith in
the school,” Blumberg said.
“What we did last weekend
went a lot further than just ear-
ning money for muscular
dystrophy.”

“Hopefully next year people
will schedule around us instead
of us scheduling around them.”

Delts Placed On Social
Probation By The IFC

by John Billmyre

Delta Tau Delta was placed
on social probation for the re-
mainder of this semester by the
Interfraternity Council, at a
Judicial Board meeting Mon-
day, for an activity that
‘‘hindered a pledge’s academic
work,” violating By-Law VII,
Section 2 of the IFC constitu-
tion.

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee upheld the IFC punishment

on Tuesday and added the
stipulation that no girls are
allowed in the fraternity house
during the probation.

Had Delta Tau Delta elected
to do so, it could have appealed
the penalty before SAC on Tues-
day.

‘We felt we would end up with
the same penalty,” explained
Delta Tau Delta President Andy
DeMuth.

Effectively Delt will be on

probation for one week, since no
fraternity is allowed to hold
parties the week before exams.

“There was good reason for
the trial,’’ DeMuth said. He ad-
ded, ‘‘The decision was
prematurely rendered because
there was pressure from the
faculty and administration for
the IFC to remain a viable
body.”’

Newly elected IFC president

For junior president, runoff
between Powell Jones and Joe

For junior vice president:
runoff between Chris Daniel
and Joel Segall.

For sophomore EC represen-
tative, runoff between John
Martin, Stuart Miller, Nelson
Ould, and Jim Wenke.

For sophomore _ president,
runoff between Stephen King
and Glen Koontz.

For sophomore vice presi-
dent: runoff between Jack
Wells and Bud White.

The EC announced that
voting regulations prohibit
write-in candidates for runoff
elections.

In other EC _ business,
Freeman Jones of the Student
Loans Committee requested
and received a loan of $200 from
the EC reserve fund, to be paid
back in a month. He cited an
unusually large number of re-
quests for loans as the reason
for the loan.

Stuart Miller said that Coach
McHenry was_ enthusiastic
about the plan to have
cheerleaders next year and that
he had sent letters to other
small colleges for information
about their cheerleading pro-
grams.

EC Makes Minor Revisions
To W&L’s Honor System

by Joe Scott

Proposed White Book
changes affecting the
Washington and Lee Honor
Code were approved by the Ex-
ecutive Committee on Monday
and Tuesday nights.

Most of the changes were
made to clarify the E.C.’s posi-
tion on rules currently inferred
in honor trial proceedings and
to alleviate problems en-
countered by the E.C. during
honor trials held during the cur-
rent school year.

A new clause was inserted
stated that an individual member
of the Executive Committee
should disqualify himself from
participation in an honor hearing
if in that member's opinion he

would be unable to view the facts
and to judge the accused objec-
tively. The decision to disqualify
oneself should occur only in cases
prejudice

where measurable

could result to judge the accused,

E.C. President Beau Dudley
said that the new clause was
“intended to get something on
paper to authorize actions
presently not covered in the
White Book.”’ He also felt that
the ‘‘second sentence was as
important as the first.”’

Junior Class representative
Steve Abraham disagreed. He
felt it was ‘‘adding volume to
the White Book that was not
needed.’ Sophomore represen-
tative Bob Willis also saw no
need for the addition. The pro-

posal passed 6-5.

Pargraph C on page six was
extended to clarify the E.C.’s
position on admission of new
evidence during an honor trial.
If during the course of a trial, the
E.C. discovers that additional
witnesses and/or evidence may be
introduced provided the accused
agrees and has an opportunity to
prepare for its introduction. If the
accused does not agree the E.C,
shall decide whether to proceed
without the evidence or terminate
the hearing.”

Senior Law _ representative
John Murphy commented that
‘if the preliminary _ in-
vestigative team hasn’t
gathered all the information
then more power to the accus-
ed.”’

Freshman _ representative
Charles Scott disagreed and
said that ‘‘we should have the
opportunity to _ introduce
evidence.’ He also felt that
disallowing this evidence would
be a great injustice to the honor
system.

Added also on page six was an
explanation of the acquittal pro-
cedure. A vote of Acquittal by
more than a majority of the
members hearing the case ter-
minates the hearing with a verdict
of not guilty. This vote of acquit-
tal may be taken at any time dur-
ing the hearing.

‘I wanted to spell out the op-
tions,’’ said Dudley, referring to

the rewording of paragraph H
on page six. “It clarifies
testifies and _ closing
statements.’’ The re-wording
emphasizes that the accused is
allowed to “‘testify and/or read
a closing statement.”’

Choosing to testify makes the
accused answer all questions
asked by the E.C. Questioning
by the Committee during the
closing statement is formally
disallowed.

The accused and his advisors
are now included in the wording
for people who are allowed to
use the tape recording to honor
trial testimony. Previously,
paragraph A-2, page five, made
the tape available only to the
E.C. advocates.

The President may not serve as
a member of an_ investigative
team. The sentence was inserted
in the White Book’s description
of the selection of E.C. honor
trial investigators where
previously it had not been men-
tioned.

Immediate destruction of all
records in the event the accused
is declared innocent has been
changed to destruction of the
tapes at the end of the academic
year. If declared guilty, the
tape will be destroyed after a 10
year period. The White Book’s
wording before indicated that
the tape would be kept per-
manently along with the
Secretary's summary.

Other White Book changes
were re-wordings of old clauses
to emphasize points that E.C.
members wished to clarify. One
clause spelled out the options of
a student when faced with
reporting an honor violation.
‘“There’s no change as far as
I’m concerned,”’ said Dudley.

New sentences emphasizing
the confidentiality of the hear-
ings were passed by a 6-5 vote.
Arguments against the change
focused on the ‘unnecessary
adding on of verbiage.”’

Should the accused withdraw
before going to trial, the notice
shall indicate that the accused
withdrew after having been charg-
ed with a possible honor violation.
The sentence was added by a
unanimous vote to paragraph K
on page seven.

g IFC Puts Delts On

Social Probation

(continued from page 1)
Syd Farrar said, “If no decision
had been made by the Judicial
Board, then we would have lost
faculty or administration sup-
port.’’ Farrar is also a member
of SAC, as president of the IFC.

Both Farrar and Danny Mur-
phy, Assistant Dean of Students
and Assistant Director of Ad-
missions, said the matter was
‘brought up because there was
a complaint.”

The complaint originated
with Dr. Michael A. Pleva,
Associate Professor of
Chemistry, who sent a letter of
complaint to Murphy that was
relayed to the IFC.

“If any individual, fraternity
or faculty member has a case of
any nature that they want taken
to the Judicial Board, I will take
it there, and it will then go to
SAC,”’ said Murphy.

“If something comes to my
attention, I must investigate it
was fully as I can,”’ added Mur-

phy.
The complaint was that a Delt
initiation activity had

prevented a Delt pledge from
attending class fully prepared.
A quiz was scheduled for that
class period and the student
scored below his normal

average, according to the let-
ter.

One student in that class in-
dicated the pledge announced
that he received 14 out of a
possible 20 points.

“They got us on circumstan-
tial evidence,’’ said DeMuth.

Another Delt said ‘‘a subjec-
tive decision had been made by
Farrar before the trial
started.” He added that Farrar
knew the newly initiated Delt
from varsity football.

‘It comes down to said or un-
said peer pressure that you
should be at a fraternity func-
tion,” Farrar said and added,
“It was initiation.”

In other IFC decisions
reviewed by SAC, a $100 fine
and a $30 fine were upheld by
SAC against Kappa Alpha for
damages made on the Lambda
Chi house.

SAC also upheld an IFC
punishment of a member of the
Phi Kappa Sigma house for his
behavior at a pledge banquet at
a local hotel.

Neither the hotel proprietor
nor Phi Kap wanted the matter
to be pursued, but the situation
came to Murphy’s attention and
was investigated.

William J. Stearns,
Washington & Lee’s head swim-
ming coach for the past thirteen
seasons, has announced his
resignation from that position.
Stearn’s resignation will
become effective at the end of
the current academic year.

“T am resigning from my
position to develop my housing
business”, said the coach. “I
have no differences with the
University, I feel it is time for
myself to move on to other lines
of work.”

In thirteen seasons with
Washington & Lee, Stearns has
posted an 84-41 swimming
record and his water polo teams
have gone 25-18 in two years of
intercollegiate competition.

“‘We’re extremely sorry to

see Bill leaving the coaching
profession’’, said Athletic
Director William D. McHenry.
“He has been a very valuable
member of our physical educa-
tion and intercollegiate pro-
grams.”

Stearns’ resignation comes at
the end of a very stormy season
for the swim team. In the past
season, the swimmers’ meet
record was 2-8, as compared to
the previous team’s mark of
10-1. Moreover, the Generals
finished twenty-seventh in this
year’s NCAA Division HII
Championships, while last
year’s team finished tenth in
the same event. This season
was also the first time in five
years that a W&L swim team
has failed to crack the top ten
for Division III teams. It was
also only the second losing
season for a Generals’ swim
team since the end of World
War II.

The coach himself drew
criticism from _ local
newspapers for his controver-
sial housing practices, in-
cluding his policies on renova-
tions and evictions of local

families. Stearns has also been
highlighted in several housing
articles featured in the Ring-
tum Phi.

The swim teams disappoin-
ting performance and Stearns’
sudden resignation naturally
raised the question of his in-
terest in coaching the team this
year. “I believe that my hous-
ing business in no way affected
my coaching ability,” said the
coach. ‘‘Coaching§ at
Washington & Lee was my
number one priority, and I gave
it my best effort.”

Stearns’ resignation comes at
possibly the peak of his
coaching prowess. An earlier
predecessor of Stearns, Cy
Twombly, coached swimming
at Washington & Lee for thirty-
two seasons. Still, Stearns feels
it is the correct decision to
move on. ‘In thirteen years at
W&L I feel that I’ve made the
swimming program very com-
petitive and successful. At this
time, I thing that there is not
much more for me to ac-
complish.”’

No successor to Stearns has
yet been named.

Kimbrough Awarded

Research Grant

Dr. Emory Kimbrough, head
of Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s sociology and an-
thropology department, has
been awarded a research grant
from the Maurice L. Mednick
Fund for summer work in
England.

The Mednick Fund is ad-
ministered by the Virginia
Foundation for Independent
Colleges (VFIC), a joint fund-
raising consortium of 12 four-
year private colleges in the
state, including W&L.

Kimbrough will use his Med-
nick research grant for study
this summer at Oxford in the
California Berkeley Worcester
College Program. His work will
be in the areas of national
welfare policy and city govern-
ment, management and
oolitics.

The VFIC administers the
fund to encourage the profes-
sional development of college
teachers and improve their
competence through grants for
research and advanced study,
and to assist highly qualified,
needy students in their up-
perclass years in college. This
year, the VFIC has announced
nine Mednick grants to pro-
fessors in Virginia colleges, in-
cluding Kimbrough, and two
student awards.

Kimbrough has __ taught
sociology at W&L since 1962 and
became department head in
1967. His fields of teaching and
research specialty are
bureaucratic organizations,
population, and _ urban
sociology.

W&L Graduates In Lexington...

Danny
Murphy

by Stuart Snyder

Danny N. Murphy, Assistant
Dean of Students, Coordinator
of Fraternities, and Assistant
Director of Admissions, was
once a Washington and Lee stu-
dent himself. His job entails ex-
actly what his title states.

He helps with high school
recruitment and makes admis-
sions decisions. Also, he is stu-
dent coordinator of Fraternity
Affairs and director of the In-
terfraternity Council. But like
the others in these pages, his
memory of W&L goes back
quite a bit further.

Murphy, originally from Lit-
tle Rock, Arkansas, graduated
from W&L in 1973, majoring in
English and Sociology. He at-
tended W&L during one of its’
most troubled times, a time
period shortly after the Kent
State shootings and just after
the start of the bombings of
Cambodia.

He was a freshman when, as
he recalls, about a week of
disturbance broke out in May of
1970. It was the direct result of
the bombing of Camodia, which
meant expansion of the Indo-
China War, and the Kent State
shootings.

According to Murphy, the
week was punctuated by rallies
in front of Lee Chapel, students
wanting to go to Washington,
D.C. to protest the war,
emergency meetings by ad-
ministration and faculty, and
threats on the R.0.T.C.
building. It all culminated in
about 700 of the 1,365 students
filing for incompletes in one or
more of their subjects to protest
the Vietnam War.

It all started with the United
States bombing of Cambodia,
while the memories of Kent
State were still fresh. Ac-
cording to an official release by
W&L’s News Office, the first
campus student action was an
evening really on Tuesday, May
5, that attracted 400 to 500
students to protest the Cambo-
dian ‘“‘situation.’’ During the
rally, which had no formal
organization, some students re-
quested a one-day strike
against classes the next day.

 

Ve

 

According to Murphy, the ad-
ministration and faculty began
to have emegency meetings to
decide what to do. At about the
same time, some ‘students
from the University of Virginia
or wherever they were from”
came to the campus and started
to conduct rallies in front of Lee

cause,” he said.

‘‘For the most part, the W&L
students felt they were handling
things themselves and the out-
side students were interferring
in things they should not be
meddling in,’’ Murphy said.

He remembered that the out-
side students asked W&L

am.”

Murphy said this was just an
example of how much W&L
does care for its students and
part of the reason why he came
back.

According to Murphy, at the
same time as the “‘intruding”’
students were making their

Murphy reflects on

Vietnam era at W&L:
rallies in front of Lee Chapel, 700 students filing for

Chapel.

In fact, there were speakers
there every day thoughout the
trouble, stated William J. Watt,
Dean of the College.

Murphy recalled going to
listen to some of their speeches.
He said that these students ad-
vocated blowing up
“everything”’ without thinking
what they would do after that.
“They shared the same view as
Abbie Hoffman: the govern-
ment was doing terrible things.
Thus, we should tear it all down
and worry later about
rebuilding it,’’ Murphy said.

Murphy only agreed with the
“outsiders’’ in their opposition
to the war. He felt that they of-
fered no ‘‘viable alternatives.”
He added, ‘‘It is useless to just
blow things up without a pur-
pose.”’

However, Murphy felt that
the outside students were
honest in their efforts. They felt
they were furthering ‘‘the

students what their school was
doing for them. They added that
the administrators were too
slow in their decisions and they
didn’t really care for the
students. .

In fact, according to Murphy,
during one of their speeches,
they even asked out right,
“Where is your President
now?’’ President Huntley was
in the crowd listening to what
they-had to say, as he had been
through most of the speeches.
He spoke up and said, ‘‘Here I

speeches ‘‘threats were made to
blow up our own R.O.T.C.
building.”’

However, in order to insure
the safety of the building, a
group of about 110 students
formed to protect the building,
Murphy stated.

He added, these students used
walkie-talkies borrowed from
the R.O.T.C. building to keep in
touch with one another. “‘It is
ironic because most of the
students were vehemently op-
posed to the Vietnam’ War;

 

however, they felt that violence
to get rid of violence was
wrong,”’ said Murphy.

As Murphy recalled, the
situation eneded with the ad-
ministration and _ faculty
deciding to allow students who
wanted to participate in the ac-
tivities in Washington, D.C. to
take an incomplete in one or
more of their courses. However,
the incompletes had to be made
up by September 30, 1970, he
said.

According to Watt, approx-
imately 700 students elected to
take one or more incompletes,
but he added, many more ac-
tually participated. He conclud-
ed that probably every student
was involved in one way or
another.

Although he did not go to
Washington, D.C., Murphy felt
that it was a worthwhile cause.
He felt the whole experience
was ‘*stimulating.’’
“Of course, some students just
used it as an excuse to get out of
classes, but most were

Dan Scott

by Chris Chatfield

Dan Scott, a drama major,
graduated from W&L in 1977. A
former manager of the Cockpit
(last year) and bartender at the
Lexington Country Club, Scott
now manages« the University
Record Store and is a night disc
jockey on WREL.

When asked about his impres-
sions of changes at W&L in his
first years here, Scott noted
several examples.

“First, when I was an
undergrad there was a lot less
dishonesty. Working at W&L
I've been able to see how much
students steal,’ ’she said.

“It used to bé you could leave
your books somewhere and
come back a few days later to
find them still there — not any
more. In February $140 worth of
records and tapes were stolen
from the record store,’’ Scott
said,

Scott was the manager of the
Cockpit last year. He quit
‘‘because I needed more
money,’ and because of pro-
blems with student organiza-
tions.

“One thing that really blew
me out when I was manager of
the Cockpit was that I literally
had to fight the students for
their own good. I had to fight
them to instate cover charges —
so we could get more bands and
to get a stage built for the per-

academic tastes as changed.
“Students are less concerned
with a liberal arts education.
They just don’t appreciate the
fact that they are in a liberal
arts college which gives them a
chance to try everything.

‘‘The students I see are either

“Students are either

vocation oriented or...they use these

. formers.

‘“T would love to see the SAB
spend their money intelligently.
I would love to see more diversi-
ty in the way they spend their
money.”’

Scott would like to be a reper-
tory actor or possibly teach
drama. ‘‘I like Lexington,’’ he
said, ‘‘But there is not much op-
portunity for me to beocme
financially solvent working
here.”’

‘My wife, Pam, is a junior at
Hollins and I owe an incredible
amount of money to the univer-
sity, so 1 may be here for a
while.”’

Scott also sees students’

vocation oriented or they see
the inevitability of entering the
business world so they use these
four years for escape, a last
fling.

“Since going to W&L, I’ve
gotten a lot more conservative
in my educational philosophy. If
I went to college again I would
balance my major with Latin or
Greek and more maths and
sciences.”

What Makes

Paul “Flamer” Fleming

by MikePerry ..

Whill most Washington and
Lee graduates leave our town
upon graduation, a few find
their way back to Lexington.
One such W&L alumnus is Paul
‘Flamer’ Fleming, class of
1975, and currently in charge of
the check cashing service at the
University Bookstore. I caught
up with Flemming at Central
Lunch, one of his favorite
hangouts, to discuss
Washington & Lee’s past, pre-
sent and future.

In September, 1967, Fleming
began his academic career at
W&L following a two week
delay caused by a case of viral
pneumonia. He became
disgusted with the ‘‘glorified
boarding school’ atmostphere
and left in November, 1968 to
enlist in the Army. Fleming
found many of the University’s
regulations such as no women
or liquor permitted in the
dorms, regular Saturday morn-
ing classes, a maximum of
three cuts permitted per class,
no freshman cars and a re-
quired dress code (coat and tie)
to be excessive.

Fleming describes the 1960's

cerned with looks and images.”’

On the subject of town-gown
relations, Fleming believes that
many of the existing conflicts,
particularily those related to
the noise ordinance were pro-
mpted by what he termed “‘ex-
cessive Spring term partying”’
and the fact that students were
“setting new records for the
number of bad checks written in
a term” Fleming suggests that
fraternities could ‘‘solve the
noise problem by starting their
parties earlier.’”’ Fleming ex-
plains that fraternity parties us-
ed to start late because dorm
parietals at the neighboring
girls’ schools prevented the
girls from getting to W&L by
9:00 p.m., but today he sees no
reason why parties cannot start
at8p.m.

1972 was not devoid of student
initiated pranks either, as
Fleming recalls that one par-
ticular evening several
members of the freshman class
kidnapped a classmate named
Al Black. The students paraded
through the streets of Lexington
carrying Black on their

as a “turbulent era,” par-
ticularily 1968 and _ 1969,
characterized by “noon rallies
in front of Evans Dining Hall by
staff, faculty and students.”
Fleming points out that there
was a great deal of pressure on
students to stay in school and
get into graduate school posed
by the draft. Others felt
pressure to enlist and go to fight
in Vietnam.

While Fleming maintains that
many aspects of the University
were being ‘‘questioned and ex-
amined,” he is quick to point
out that no violence erupted
“like at Berkley.”’ Fleming at-
tributes this to the ‘‘levelhead-
ed’’ handling of the affair by
Administration ‘‘before
anything got out of hand,’’ and
the fact that ‘‘W&L doesn’t ap-
peal to the radical student.”

Following a three year tour of
duty in the Army, including a
year in Vietnam, Fleming
returned to W&L in 1971 and
graduated in 1975. Fleming
found W&L very much changed
due to the abolition of many
bothersome regulations. Flem-
ing was impressed with the
school and proceeded to earn
the nickname ‘‘Flamer’’ for
“flaming out,’’ an expression
for having a good time,’”’ which

Fleming believes that the
Washington and Lee student
body changed in his absence
and was no longer characteriz-
ed) by a ‘‘country-club at-
mosphere”’ consisting of a well-

heeled student body possessing :

‘a different car each semester.
Today students are less con-

tional supporters as they con-
tinued. Local residents heard
the noise and the _ students

cheering “Al Black!” and
reasoned that a race riot was
taking place.

Apathy, says Fleming “‘is the
one thing that hasn’t changed at
W&L.”’ Fleming believes that
students today are ‘‘more ra-
tional about issues’’ and
recognize the limits of student
input in the University decision-
making process.

Fleming calls the present
W&L student body a ‘‘good mix-
ture’ composed of a variety of
backgrounds represented by

Mock Convention:

 

in Richmond to construction
work in Phoenix, Arizona. Last
January, he began running the

“ check cashing service at the

University Bookstore designed
to aid students cashing checks
written on out-of-state banks.
He is kept quite busy —
especially a few weeks back
when a record of $10,444 was
cashed before Fancy Dress
Weekend. His activities in Lex-
ington also include work as the
“Evil Eye,” keeping watch
over student apartments during
the Christmas Break.

On the subject of housing,
Fleming points out that up-

perclassmen have always had
problems finding good housing.
Fleming believes that many
students are irresponsible
tenants, but adds that some
landlords ‘‘do take advantage of
students.’’ Fleming suggests
that the University publish a
booklet or offer a seminar on
the subject of housing covering
leases and rental procedures.
Fleming adds that the Universi-
ty should ‘‘set up a committee
to arbitrate landlord-tenant
disputes without the use of the
courts,’’ — such a committee
would. help to safeguard
landlord’s rights as well.
Fleming does not see
coeducation in W&L’s future.
‘As long as enrollments are up
and finances are stable, _ it
seems W&L fulfills a need. A lot
of other universities went coed
because they had to.’’ Fleming
calls coeducation a- ‘‘dead

issue,” explaining that it
doesn’t come up as much as it
used to. Fleming also foresees a
“challenge to the liberal arts
program’”’ of education. Flem-
ing maintains that students are
questioning whether or not ‘‘the
hassle and expense of a W&L
degree is worth it,” and
believes that the administration
will have to accomodate these
‘students concerned with hav-
ing a more marketable
degree.”’

In terms of his own future,
Paul Fleming explains that he
has always viewed his job at the
Bookstore as a ‘‘temporary’ but
fun experience.”’ His plans for
the future include ‘‘trying to get
out of town as fast as I can’’ and
more specifically returning to
the firm he worked for in Rich-
mond or elsewhere in the field
of personnel management.

hue ak’.

Now that the ‘‘New Wave”’
has gone through birth,
childhood, suffered an early
death, and been reincarnated, it
may be time to try and decide
just what sort of effect it has
had, not upon the _ political
stratospheres of Britain or the
class structure of the Bowery,
but upon the listener, the fun-
damental raison d'etre for
music in the first place.

What, if anything, are we
hearing now that we wouldn't
have been able to hear three
years ago? Did the punks, as
some have claimed, scare the
‘boring old farts’’ into putting a

little life back into their music? -

In other words, what has the
cumulative effect of this
“movement”’ been for a Yank
who's never seen Akron or the
Bowery?

In America as well as in Bri-
tain, the whole thing started as
a reaction to the social,
political, and musical apathy of
the ‘70’s At first it seemed like
everything was coming up
roses. The release of Live at the
Rat and Live at CBGB's ap-
peared to signal a new interest
in the grassroots level of rock
‘n’ roll by convincingly
demonstrating the truth of the
old maxim that a good deal of
the best music never reaches
the public’s ears.

Simultaneously, in Britain,
the Sex Pistols and the Damned
were succeeding in shocking
everyone with their lifestyles as
well as their music, while Nick
Lowe and the rest of the Stiff
gang were gathering on the
sidelines, preparing to attack
that elusive American market.

What to many _ people
represented the ‘‘death”’ of the
New Wave can best be dated to
a period spanning the spring
and early summer of 1978. The
causes of that. death, which
eventually turned out to be only
a dry spell, are just as uncer-
tain as anything else about the
movement, but the three most
significant ones appear to be:
a) a bad case of overcoverage
by the press; b) the idiotic job
of talent scouting done by the
major labels, who favored us
with albums by Tuff Darts,
DMZ, and Pere Ubu (all of
which had one common
denominator — cheap notorie-
ty). while ignoring such ge-
nuinely talented bands as the

Mainwaring and

Real Kids and the Laughing
Dogs; ¢c) perhaps most impor-
tant of all, the Rolling Stones
and Bruce Springsteen, whose
albums and summer tours gave
credibility back to the
mainstream.

As of the present minute,
things appear to have reached a
status quo of sorts. Television
and the Talking Heads followed
up somewhat disappointing
debut albums with great second
efforts, thereby opening the
door for a ‘‘new’’ New Wave
characterized by highly polish-
ed arrangements’ instrumenta-
tion, and production. Mink
DeVille and the Shirts followed
up their Live at CBGB's debuts
with excellent first albums, and
the Stiff did succeed in captur-
ing the American market, at

least to some extent.

So what about those
“cumulative effects’ spoke of
earlier?? Well, even though a
lot of people believe that talent,
like murder, will out, the facts
of life in the recording industry
seem to do an effective job of
stifling this tendency. In other
words, the chances of Blondie
or Talking Heads having singles
reach the top-40 without benefit
of the notoriety surround the
movement of which they were a
part would have been very slim.

Similarly, it’s not very like
that Columbia would have pick-
ed up the US. distribution
rights for the second albums by
the Clash or the Boomtown
Rats, and then proceeded to
take out full page adds for them

This letter is for real. It is no parodist’s fan-
tasy. One breezy spring afternoon in 1968 as I
was walking to my car from the Bookstore a
piece of paper blew against my leg. More
from a sense of order and neatness than
curiosity I picked it up. Eleven years later it
has lost none of its realism and Yes —
War, Watergate and inflation
have swept across us since the distraught
parent wrote that letter. Yet, here is one of
our world’s eternal verities. And I assuredly
would predict that ten to fifteen years from
now the student who received that letter will
be writing a similar one to his son at

Saturday afternoon. Basically,
they are an original band doing
original songs, as well as reciv-

in classroom ‘‘C’’ of the Law
School, free of charge.

Welles’ Falstaff (1965) is a
free adaptation of several of
Shakespeare’s plays: Richard
II, Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2,
Henry V, and The Merry Wives
of Windsor. Welles came to
Falstaff after considerable ex-
perience with Shakespeare. In
1938, he produced a theatrical
adaptation of Shakespeare’s
historical tragedies in which he

played Falstaff; in 1948, he pro-

duced a movie version of
Macbeth in which he played the
title role; and in 1951, he
directed an adaptation of
Othello for film.

Welles reconceptualized the
material he used in Fallstaff
and made a_ non-academic
Shakespeare movie. It remains
first and foremost a Welles
film. One of a handful of
American ‘auteur’ directors
which today includes Altman,
Scorcese, and Kubrick, Welles

returns and gives added power.

in Falstaff to some of the
bravura camera techniques and
thematic concerns which ap-
peared most notably in_ his
masterpiece Citizen Kane
(1941). Thus, he presents a com-
plexly regarded world of ex-
cess, obsession, and paradox
through stunning work with
light and dark.

Welles shot Falstaff on loca-
tion in Spain and Switzerland
whose castles provides a
dramatic backdrop for this
moving meditation on the con-
flict between a private world of
taverns and wenches and public
work of political responsibility.
Elegiac in tone, the film focuses
largely on the great comic
figure of Falstaff, showing his
relationship with the young Hal
(who becomes Henry V), and
his death. John Gielgud plays
Henry IV, and Margaret
Rutherford is Mistress Quickly.

The Fiim Society will present
two more programs after
Falstaff. The first, in April, will
be a double bill featuring the
Maysles brothers short The
Running Fence (the Maysles
brothers were the directors of
Gimme Shelter), and the ex-
traordinary Cuban movie
Memories of Underdevelop-
ment. The second program, in
May, will feature the recent
Italian comedy We All Loved

wasn't up to. the
material. To begin with, Zoo
Story is Albee’s first play, or the
first to see production, at any
rate, having its premiere on 29
September, 1959, in Berlin, and
in a German translation. It was
about as far off Broadway as
anyone has managed to get,

Zoo Story provided a lot of ex-
perience for Albee, and one
look too closely to
discover the same flashes of wit
and black humor that have

But I was talking of first im-

pressions. I concluded that Zoo
Story’s purpose was to startle
an audience; and maybe to
mock.

It seemed as though the bitter
growls of an angry man were
acceptable things to produce in
front of an audience, and that a
valid function of the stage was
to present the weird and shock-
ing, for they had an absolute
virtue in that constitution.

It took a couple of years of my
own thought and experience,
and a number of re-readings of
the play, to make me change
my mind. Sure, I had always
sensed that the theme of the
play was, or was supposed to
be, ‘“‘love,’’ and that the unor-
thodox threatment of that sub-
ject was what made the play
special.

What I had to come slowly to
see, though, was that the play
was written to celebrate love,
not unorthodoxy, and to explore
the implications of emotional
and spiritual commitment a bit
further than others may have
done.

The fact that the play is the
record of an encounter between
an older man, named Peter,
and a young one, named Jerry,
who, after delivering a message
dealing with the centrality of
love to human existence’ dies, a
suicide, perhaps, or else just a
very surprised young man, has
convinced some readers to
regard ZOO STORY as a com-

Rabid is a moody, graphic and convincing horror story of what

victims do not die; instead, they go on to infest others, and soon an
entire city is contaminated with the disease and with the fear of be-

Generals find lost

offense - win 15-10

by Doug Linton

The Generals bounced back
from a loss on Saturday to
smother the Blue Hens of
Delaware by a score of 15-10
yesterday on Wilson Field.
Many team members tried to
steal the show, but to no avail.
as the entire W&L squad ralliec
to raise their season record to
4-2.

George Santos put a John
Kemp pass into the back of the
net within the first minute of the
game, but Delaware retaliated
with three consecutive strikes.
W&L then capitalized on two ex-
tra man opportunities. John
Black scored unassisted before
he later passed off to Jay
Foster, who tied the game for
the Generals at 3-3 by the end of
the first period.

It took Jeff Fritz less than a
minute of the second quarter to
find Black open, who then net-
ted his second goal to give the
Generals a lead which they
were not to relinquish for the
rest of the day. The Blue Hens
managed to squeak two by Bob
Clements and a tough W&L
defense in the second quarter,
but this didn't phase Freshman
Rob Staugaitis in the least.
Staugaitis threaded four con-
secutive assists to Foster, John
Hooper, Sandy McDonald, and
Fritz to give the Generals an 8-5
lead at halftime.

Both defenses were solid in
the third quarter, as each team
scored only twice. It only took
the Blue Hens 18 seconds to
work one shot which found its
way past Clements, but on a
fast break exactly a minute
later, Black scored once more
on a feed from Foster. At 10:15
MeDonald tound Geott brent
open in front. Brent's goal was
followed by the Blue Hens’ se-
cond tally of the period, making
it 10-7 with only a quarter to
play.

Delaware used only 6 seconds
of an extra man situation to
make the score 10-8 at the start
of the final quarter. The
Generals responded with an ex-
plosive four goal surge. John
Herbert had his first goal of the
season off of a Roman Kupecky
pass, but only after Joe Ohve
made a great effort to keep the

action. W&L is now 9-2 and 12th in nation.

Coaches Jack Emmer and
Chuck O'Connell felt the same
way after the game — “‘It was
the medicine that the doctor
ordered!" They also feel that
the momentum will not only
carry over to Saturday's game
against Towson, but hopefully
throughout the rest of the
season.

“It was exactly what we need-
ed,’ said Emmer. “The guys
knew they had their backs to the
wall and they came out smok-
ing. Even though the Generals
gave up three early goals, they
picked up momentum and sus-
tained it throughout the game.
The plavers seemed to enjoy go-
ing back to a double high-post
offense, taking more shots
yesterday than they had in any
other game all season. The
picking and weaving called for
a lot of movement on the part of
the Generals, and they got this
motion, especially from their
middies.

Jay Foster had a good day,
despite two healing ankles. Ot
course he was sore at the end of
the game, but at least W&L had
won, and according to Foster,
“everything always hurts
worse When vou jose.’

Rob Staugaitis was mostly
happy that the team was able to
vet it all together. “We needed a
biz win today, and the fact that
13 of the 15 goals were assisted
says a lot. It makes the win
even bigger.’ Staugaitis too
was pleased with the midfield
motion, noting that “its a heck
of a lot easier to get the ball to

good protection from. Steve
Johnson, Jim Herbert, John
Hooper, Don Rigger and the
rest of the defenders.

The lacrosse team traveled to
Chapel Hill, North Carolina on
Saturday only to be snuffed by
the Tar Heels, 13-6. This makes
the series record between the
two schools 17-8, in favor of the
Generals.

North Carolina exploded for
six early goals. Jeff Fritz and
John Kemp each responded
with unassisted tallies for the
Generals, making it 6-2 at the
end of the first quarter.

In the second period the Tar
Heels scored three goals to the
Generals’ two. John Black took
a George Santos pass and hit for
W&L, with Kemp also netting
his second of the day. By
halftime the Generals faced an
unsurmountable 9-4 deficit.

W&L was shut out in the third
quarter. North Carolina added
two more to make it 11-4 with
only one quarter left to play.

The final quarter was the
closest of the game with each
team scoring twice. Black had
both W&L goals, taking passes
from Mike Pressler and Fritz.
Black's last goal came with on-
ly 12 seconds left in the game.

The Tar Heels changed the
Generals’ man down success
from 1 of 17 attempts to 5 of 25
trys. Even with other aspects of
their game failing, W&L had
previously been able to boast
great strength in this category.
But North Carolina was able to

Tennis team
ends week by
routing VMI 8-1

by Nat Lovell

The W&L tennis team is over
the hump of the season for now,
anyway, as the competition
should ease up some in upcom-
ing matches. Despite missing
various members due to
academics during the past
week, the netmen turned in
some close matches and won
two of five for the week.

On Wednesday, the Generals
took a trip down to Chapel Hill,
Hill, N.C., better know as
paradise. The long trip took its
toll, however, as they lost 9-0 to
UNC. At number one Stewart
Jackson could not get into the
match against Gary Taxman
and lost 6-1, 6-1. Doug Baker
was defeated by Neal Carl] 6-2,
6-1. Pat Norris was blown off
the court by Chris Fenichel 6-0,
6-0. Sumner Bouldin went down
to his old nemesis Tiger Buford
who won 6-0, 6-2. Nat Lovell
completely choked off his first
varsity match and lost to Jamie
Karson 6-0, 6-2. Tim Baird was
obviously watching other things
bounce besides tennis balls dur-
ing his match with Mark Trout-
man, the score was 6-0, 6-3.

At number one_ doubles,
Jackson and Norris lost to Tax-
man and Potts 6-1, 6-4. Gaker
and Bouldin were defeated by
Fenichel and Buford 6-4, 6-0.
Baird and Lovell fell to Heier

and Disco 6-4, 6-3.
Friday saw the netmen lose a
regretful match to George

Washington University by the
score of 5-4. Jackson got off toa
slow start and could not reeover

in time to take the match from
Dave Haggerty who won 6-2,
6-4. Shaw Cranfield continued
his. string of brilliance in
defeating Josh Ripple, 6-0, 6-3.
Doug Gaker came back to beat
Mike Yellin in a close three set-
ter 4-6, 6-4. Dave Constine was
defeated by Mark Bell 6-2, 6-2.
Norris fell to Mark Lichenstein
6-3, 6-3. In the final singles spot,
Wes Yonge was over-powered
by Larry ‘‘Get”’ Small 6-2, 6-2.

In doubles, Jackson and Cran-
field connected for a 6-2, 6-3 win
over Haggerty and Yellin. Nor-
ris and Schuler beat Ripple and
Small 6-3, 7-5. In the deciding
match, the lack of playing time
together showed as Gaker and
Yonge were beated by Bell and
Lichenstein 5-7, 6-3, 6-3.

Saturday, the netmen travel-
ed to George Mason University
and thrashed them 8-1. Jackson
won a close match over Mark
Miller 7-6, 6-4. Cranfield
dominated Ted Meyer 6-1, 6-3.
Gaker whipped Rich Smith 6-1,
6-3. Constine edged Rich Le-
moine 6-3, 4-6, 6-4. Norris
recovered to win over John
Kennan 2-6, 6-3, 6-1. Yonge lost
the only match of the day at the
hands of Thomas Wallace 6-3,

The team went on to take all
three doubles matches to com-
plete the romp.

big win over EX&H

by Greg Branon
Despite running in extremely
poor track and weather condi-
tions, the Generals topped
Emory and Henry 8912 -55!2 in

last Saturday’s away dual
meet.

Coach Norris Aldridge
remarked, Overall it was

another good team effort. It was
an impossible day with track
conditions and rain.”

Those with first places includ-
ed Jack Norberg in the 100
meters, Chris Daniel in the
800m, Rich Bird in the 1500m,
Norvell Scott in the 110m high
hurdles, Greg Branan in the two
miles, the mile relay team of

Billy Morris, Dave Cordell, Ron
Calkins, and Russ Rector, Phil
Dunlay in the shot and Bob
Campbell in the pole vault.
Adding points by finishing se-
cond were Billy Morris-400m,
Henry Hairston-800m, Greg
Branan-1500m, Russ_ Rector-
110m high hurdles, Rob Kelley-
long jump, Norvell Scott-triple
jump, Scott Swope-javelin,
Hamilton Davis-pole vault’ and
Russ Rector-high jump.
Aldridge added, ‘‘Jack
Norberg was injured half way
through the meet and we had
good replacements. The
distance men came through as
they had to. Phil Dunlay was a
surprise as we had expected no

points in the shot put.”’

Those with overall good per-
formances’ were. Bill
Chesbrough ‘‘with a 120’ disc
throw,’’ Norvell Scott in all his
events, Scott Swope with “his
best throw ever,’ and the pole
vaulters ‘‘who swept the event **

This Friday the Generals
travel to Wake Forest for a
‘“‘non-scoring meet.” ‘‘It’s just
going to be a relaxed meet with
people going for time,” said
Aldridge. He added, ‘‘We’re im-
proving every week but its go-
ing to be tough to keep the edge
during exam week.’’ The
Generals will put their 3-1
record on the line against ODAC
teams after exams.

JV. lax team
finds success

by Ed Taylor

On Wednesday, March 21, the
JV lacrosse team lost a heart-
breaker, 12-10, to the Amherst
(Mass. ) College Varsity to even
their record at 1-1.

The Generals entered the
final period leading 8-7. They
scored two quick goals but then
watched as Amherst scored
four unanswered goals to win
the contest, 12-10.

Amherst hit the scoreboard
first but the Generals quickly
followed with a _ score by
freshman Timothy Monahan.
After Amherst scored twice,
W&L tied the score at 3-3 with
goals by junior Steve Herold
and sophomore Stuart Reinhoff.
The game rocked along with the
two clubs exchanging goals un-
til Amherst ran off their string
of four goals at the end of the
game.

W&L was led by Reinhoff,
Doug Seitz, Louis Close and
Scott Graham as they each
scored two goals. Monahan and

Herold contributed one goal
apiece. Freshman’ Bob
Carpenter also turned in a fine
game but did not score.

An interesting note on
Carpenter is that he was ex-
pected to play for the varsity
team this season but injured his
knee while playing fall lacrosse.
The coaches want to bring him
back from the injury slowly, but
he should still provide some fine
lacrosse this season.

Earlier in the team’s youny
season, the Generals defeated
the University of Rochester
Varsity, 15-8. As a result the
record now stands at 1-1 for
Coach Rolf Piranian’s team.

Led by the Tri-Captains:
sophomore Kevin Bell and
juniors Steve Herold and Doug
Seitz, the JV Generals should
experience an interesting and
successful season.

The team entertains Roanoke
on April 3, at home, beginning
at 3:00.

| Baseball : 2-3

by Chris Sisto

This year’s edition of the var-
sity baseball team has compiled
a respectable 2-3 record after
the first week of the season.
They opened this year with an
impressive 10-2 whipping of
Eastern Mennonite. Chip Childs
pitched well and Jeff Haggerty
belted the only home run of the
game. The next day, the
Generals split a doubleheader
against Longwood College.
W&L lost the first game 5-2

total minutes, but W&L failed to
capitalize each of the six times.
The Generals were hit eight
times for 6:30.

Goalie Bob Clements had 12
saves to bring his total up to 80
after five games. Ware Palmer
also saw a little action in the
cage for W&L and had one save
while allowing no goals. The
Generals continued their sloppy
clearing, failing 19 and making
26. North Carolina also failed a
few (16), but cleared suc-
cessfully 31 times. This loss
made the Generals 3-2 on the
year.

his usual victory, this time over
Bill Clark 6-3, 6-0. Gaker con-
tinued his history of troubles
versus foreign players as he lost
to Australian Colin Davis 6-1,
6-2. Constine, who is admittedly
having problems this season,
was crushed by Todd Furniss in
a double bagel job 6-0, 6-0. Baird
lost to John Harrison 6-1, 6-3.
Lovell let the cow off the hook
blowing a 4-1 lead in the second
set to lose to Jeff Berg 3-6, 6-4,
6-3. John Daniel found the grip
in time to defeat Tim Knerr 7-5,
6-2.

The team could not pull out
the three doubles matches
necessary to win the match, but
lost them all instead.

Tuesday, the team visited
VMI and came away victorious
8-1. Jackson blew away Bill
Vickers 6-1, 6-2. Cranfield came
back to beat Jeff Hamilton 4-6,
6-1, 6-4. Constine lost in three
sets to Louis Darden 2-6, 6-3, 63.
Norris burned Mare Withers
6-1, 6-3. Yonge.was leading Clay
Wommack 6-4 when the Keydet
developed elbow troubles and
had to default. Bob Schuler
hammered out a victory over
Paul Capozzoli 6-1, 6-1 in the last
singles match.

Jackson and _ Cranfield
coasted to victory in the first
doubles winning 6-0, 6-4. Norris
and Schuler won by default, and
Constine and Younge emerged
victorious over Capozzoli and
Guy Thone 6-3, 6-1.

The Generals took the second
game 4-1 when they came up
with three runs in the sixth inn-
ing of a seven inning game.

Their next opponent was
Randolph-Macon last Wednes-
day, in another double header.
The Generals dropped both
games by scores of 2-1 and 7-5.
In the first game, Childs played
a good game, giving up no earn-
ed runs, and Thad Ellis provid-
ed the only General run with a
home run. In the nightcap, the
Generals lost a 5-4 lead by giv-
ing up three runs in the fifth on
three fielding errors.

Coach Chuch Kroll is pleased
with his team’s play so far this
season. One problem for the
Generals has been working out
the early season fielding
mishaps, however.

The Generals’ next game is at
home this Thursday against
Liberty Baptist and their next
opponent, in another ODAC
game, is Hampden-Sydney in a
double header on Sunday. The
Generals are 1-2 in ODAC play
so far.

in Animal House, The Great

engaging and relaxed, but one
wishes it were put to better use
in characters other than the
burlesque ones he seems doom-
ed to portray.

Leonard Nimoy, as the token
intellectual in the film, seems to
be repeating himself. Spock
was a good character for Nimoy
back in the Star Trek days — no
emotion, no expression, just
wooden intonations — and he
was an appealing character.
Unfortunately, we can’t seem to
get the Spock out of Nimoy — he
tries, but his delivery still hits
the screen like petrefied wood.

The supporting cast is geod,

Director Philip Karfman
pulls off some entertaining
camera work — his tendency to
linger on certain scenes gives a
needed element of suspense to a
film with many faults.

Ultimately, however,
everything combines to keep
the film from ever getting off
the ground. There are some
memorable scenes — a lonely

ment. The electronic sound-
track is effective. Some bits of
acting are unusually good. But
the whole thing is wrecked first
by the preposterous choice of
San Francisco as the locale,
secondly by the ridiculous howl-

and thirdly by several unex-

flow which somehow rob the
film of continuity.

WHY DO YOU THINK

by Don Noble

This year’s student.art show
is most definitely an event
worth notice. In contrast to past
years, it is a very large and im-
pressive exhibition. There are
contributions by more than 40 of
W&L’s students. The show also
covers a wide range of media,
styles, and techniques. These
range from Oriental to Western
art forms, from modern to
traditional styles, and include
drawings, prints, -pastels, in-
kwashes, collage, and ‘pain-
tings.

Indeed, this profusion of ef-
fort spills over into the painting
studio from the gallery. It also
offers a truly striking contrast
between the various ap-
proaches which the artists take
in their expression.

Landscapes

There are quite a few attrac-
tive landscapes among the
show. Of special note are a
great number of works by
Marsh Dougherty. These are
truly handsome paintings, some
of which are landscapes of the
area. Mr. Dougherty does a fine
job of manipulating the
elements of his works and
shows a good deal of talent. His
compsotions are well thought
out out, balanced, and show
good use of color and knowledge
of space and perspective. They
convey a pleasant sense of calm
and repose.

Light and line

There are several other nice
landscapes, including Bruce
Whipple’s which subtlely utilize
light and line; Steve Handy’s,

which show a diversity of style

and skill from his almost poin-
tilistic ‘““Yellow Grove’’ to his
fine job on ‘Shore’; Steve

Hellberg’s expressive works;
and Bill Taylor’s emphasis on
limited color and shape. John
Dean also exhibits his highly

developed and individual style
in a_ typically good work,
“Crooked Bridge.” Wildlife is
well represented in Robert Cle-
ment’s stark, clear paintings as
contrasted with Graham
Hudgins’ soft pastels.

The human figure has been
used for expressive, emotional
subject in several very different
ways in the exhibit. Phillip
Welch’s ‘‘Navahoes’’ concen-
trate on a rustic, weathered
look; Tim  Lobach chooses
distortion in his ‘“‘Three Black
Men,”’ Tommy Wornom relies

on facial expression and age to
conveny his fellings; while two
of Hugh Montgomery’s pain-
tings depend on silhouette for
expression and have an almost
graphic quality.

I shouldn’t think it unlikely
for this thought to occur to
Albee, but I prefer not to see the
comparison strained. It’s
enough that we regard the event
as a love-parable, and not allow
imagination to extrapolate any
further than that. We need to
save our attention for the
language in this play, and not
let us be waylaid by intriguing
hypotheses.

The language, for my money,
is the most attractive thing
about the play; the actors are
given beautiful lines that are

It is a play by, for, and about,
sensitive and intelligent people,
and it is not, as was suggested

Orientals

There are also quite a few ad-
mirable Oriental compositions
which provide a striking con-
trast to the remainder of the
show. Notable among these are
Jeff Fritz’s lovely flower pain-
tings in Chinese ink.

Other contrast is added by the
abstract works displayed. The
most unusual and striking are
Nicholas Martin’s non-objective
works, which suggest space and
light, as well as movement in
‘* 2”. Hunt Brown’s also take
an interesting form of bright
color and distorted shape in his
expression, and can be quite
shocking. It is very satisfying to
see these attempts to break
away from _ illusionary
representation and a concentra-
tion on personal vision and in-
ner feeling.

Drawing

There are also some very fine
drawings on exhibit, particular-
ly Rob Calvert’s and Howie Col-
lier’s works, as well as those of
Andy Holds, Taylor Freeman,

 

and Chase Nelson. These are
often very expressive and show
highly controlled light, shadow,
and depth.

This is not to ignore any of the
works on display. All are very
honest and dedicated attempts
to explore artistic forms and
techniques, as well as modes of
expressing the artist’s personal
style and vision. Many are par-
ticularly noteworthy in that
they are first attempts. They
also certainly show widespread
acceptance of the opportunities
available thorugh the W&L art
program and its teaching staff.
The exhibition will be on view
through Friday, April 13 and
most of the works are for sale.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

For those of you who didn’t make it last weekend,
you missed quite a show. Washington and Lee’s first
Muscular Dystrophy Dance Marathon was a big suc-
cess, raising more than three times the original $5,000
goal in pledges.

But it was more than the dollar figure that made the
Dance Marathon a success. It was the dancers—the
people who gave up most of their weekend for kids
who are confined to wheelchairs — Who, with their en-
thusiasm, made the Marathon a worthwhile and
memorable event.

Not enough has been said about the disease of
muscular dystrophy. It is a methodical, crippling
disease which slowly creeps its way up a youngster’s
body until the muscles in his legs, then his arms, and
finally his neck and literally deteriorate. Most vic-
tims of muscular dystrophy die from heart failure
because their heart muscles just aren’t strong
enough. Almost all of those afflicted with muscular
dystrophy die before they reach their twentieth birth-
day. Right now, there is no cure for this crippling and
tragically hereditary disease. But this is what the
Dance Marathon was all about.

Perhaps we were a little too optimistic last week
when we said apathy was fading at W&L. But the one
hundred or so people who were involved in the Dance
Marathon are from a different breed. It was positive-
ly exhilarating to watch them working so hard for a
very worthy and noble cause.

Jay Blumberg, the Marathon’s chairman and in-
spiration, really deserves his own editorial. His
boundless enthusiasm in keeping the dancers’ spirits
high and the show rolling were almost superhuman.

_Of course we cannot forget that Blumberg began
organizing the Marathon last fall and stayed with it
all the way, organizing the weekend’s events so that
they ran about as smoothly as they possibly could
have. Not enough can be said about the man in the
tuxedo, except that he should take much of the credit
for one of Washington and Lee’s prouder moments.

The Muscular Dystrophy Dance Marathon was a
demonstration of the sort of spirit that many of our
critical elders say our generation does not possess.
All of those who made the weekend a success are to be
commended—from the bands to the dancers to the
workers to the sponsors. The Lexington community
has every reason to be proud of the Dance Marathon
because what it really stood for was a basic human
selflessness and concern for our fellow man that, un-
fortunately, has become a rarity in today’s overly
self-centered society.

Letters To The Editor

Student condemns IFC Judicial

Board decision as a “Kangaroo Court”

To the Editor

In a time when the fraternity system and
the IFC are struggling for judicial credibility,
the “Kangaroo” court decision involving the
Delt House and pledge activities appears
more to be an edict resulting from the
Deltaphobia which pervades the “Hill”
rather than a_ responsible exercise of
undergraduate self-government. The reason I
refer to the IFC as a “kangaroo” court is
because the decision to make an example of
the Delt House was unquestionably made
before any evidence was presented before the
Judiciary Board...and I use that term loosely.
All the evidence which was presented before
the Judiciary Board points to the fact that the
Delt pledge activities were only one hour long
and pledges were warned far in advance that
activities would be held on the night in ques-
tion. Moreover, it seems dubious that having
pledge activities for one hour could seriously
impair the academic pursuits of any con-
scientious student.

In fact, there was no evidence presented
before the Judicial Board which pointed to
negligence on the part of DTD. Syd Farrar,
who is a member of the Judicial Board and

Notice

will be president next year, offered testimony
in which he stated that it was his belief that
the pledge in question was obligated to be at
the DTD pledge activities against his will, in
spite of the pledge’s personal denial of the
conjecture.

It seems readily apparent that if a member
of the Judiciary board had personal senti-
ment concerning any case, it would be the on-
ly responsible decision available to excuse
oneself from the proceeding. Also, since Far-
rar made these sentiments known in the hear-
ing, it follows that the decision to place DTD
on social probation was made before the hear-
ing was actually held. Ultimately, “heat from
the hill’’ is responsible for the actions of the
IFC because the IFC must prove themselves
worthy of self government, as President
Huntley stated in his message to the IFC. In
light of this deicsion, it appears that more
constructive criticism and less pressure
should come from ‘“‘the hill” or more
misdirected use of judicial power will become
the rule rather than the exception.

Sincerely,
Mike Foley
DTD 80°

Arthur Silver: Lexington’s

Oldest Living Legend

by Joe Scott

Arthur Silver, the 90-year-old
living legend of Lexington, is
leaving April-1 and is moving
north to live in Maryland.

He leaves with regrets but
says he will always cherish his
59 years of memories.

His jokes are unending. His
wit still keen. His eyes seem to
look right through you to
analyze your personality and
locate your funny bone. You
have. a_ distinct feeling of
respect.

“IT took all the prizes in my
school,’ said Silver, ‘‘but the
teacher made me put them
back.”’

Born March 3, 1889, in Nor-
wich, England, Silver came to
Lexington 55 years ago after
retiring from his Vaudeville
singing and dancing career.

Murphy

(continued from page 4)

sincere.’’ He says that it was a
good chance for W&L students
to get involved and express
their points of view.

Overall, he felt that the
University handled the situa-
tion very well...and the years
have not changed his feelings
since that May of 1970.

Another event in_ his
freshman year served to shape
Murphy’s whole attitude toward
W&L, involving one of the
courses he was taking. He had
not done well on a biology prac-
tical, and he did not go the pro-
fessor, because he was embar-
rased about the grade.

As it turned out, the professor
came to him and talked to him
about the low grade. After that
he “saw what W&L is all
about.’’ The school is small
enough that the professors can
deal with the students on a one-
to-one basis, Murphy stated. ‘‘It
is that kind of thing that makes
you want to be affiliated with
W&L.”

During his years as a student
at the University he par-
ticipated in intramural sports

‘| played for a week in almost

_ every town in America,”’ said

Silver, ‘‘when beer was two
cents a glass and a movie was a
nickle.”’

Silver opened a clothing and
haberdashery store on Main
Street (now the Printer’s Ink)
after five years of travelling the
roads to sell tailor-made suits.

“They couldn’t get over the
way I made those suits,’’ said
Silver. ‘‘Measuring came
naturally to me. I asked 0 a guy
once whether he dressed to the
right or to the left. He said,
‘make the pants baggy to the
knees.”’”’

‘T like to see people laugh,”’
said Silver. ‘“‘There’s not

enough of it. People need to stay |

in good humor, that’s my
philosophy.”’

‘I was a good singer and

and on the Contact committee.
In his free time he conducted
admissions tours for the
University. He had also been
president of his fraternity,
Sigma Chi.

After graduation from W&L,
he had planned to go to law
school ‘‘as most people did
then.’’ However, upon gradua-
tion a job at the University
opened up. He applied for it im-
mediately and withdrew his law
school application.

He started in July of 1973 in an
administrative position which
included Assistant Dean of
Students. However, the term of
the job was only two years.

After his two years had ex-
pired, he found a job at the
Citizen’s and Southern Bank of
the South, located in Atlanta,
Georgia. He worked there for
two years, until his present
position opened up.

Murphy started to work for
W&L in the fall of 1977. Ac-
cording to him, he has seen
some changes since he was a
student, especially along the
line of fraternity parties. He
said that mid-week parties are

dancer in my day,’’ continues
Silver, ‘‘my personality reflects
that. I can make up a yarn
anytime.”

“But enough of my career.
Who knows me_ anymore.
They’re all gone—six feet
under, you know.”

“A man my age should be
thankful he’s alive,’ said
Silver. ‘‘Age is like an autumn
tree, it just withers away.
Everybody’s born to die. I’ve
had a lot of fun in my life and I
still do. It keeps me going.”’
When you get old, though, you
forget things.

‘‘T walk almost every day and
see all my friends. Usually I eat
in the dining room—its only
$2.90. I don’t eat in ‘the pit’
(W&L’s Cockpit) anymore—
their vegetables are cold.”’

(continued on page 16)

Reflects On W&L

more obvious than when he at-
tended the University, which he
sees is causing increased fric-
tion between the students and
faculty.

Another change he has seen is
in the average student. He
stated that students today tend
to be more conservative than
his fellow students.

Presently students tend to be
more job oriented, but it is
understandable, he said. ‘‘It is
good in one way,” but he feels
that more students should get
out and participate in the com-
munity.

Murphy attributes the dif-
ference to the facts of the Kent
State affair dying down and the
end of the United States’ in-
volvement in the Vietnam War.

However, he added, that is
not to say that his classmates
were too radical. He explained
that they were more conscious
of social issues, because it was
a time when social issues were
the topic.

In the meantime, he enjoys
the atmosphere of the people
who work with him. ‘‘They area
great staff and President
Huntley and Dean John are the
greatest to work with and Mrs.
Miller (the secretary), well, she
keeps it all going.”

Murphy said that he decided
on W&L and Lexington because
of the friendly people and the
personal contact W&L provides.

‘‘You would be surprised. |
find that I am more active here
than when I lived in the big city
of Atlanta,”’ Murphy stated.

His future plans include W&L
for an indefinite length of time.
One may wonder about the op-
portunities for social contact
and friendship for a_ staff
member who has seen most of
his school friends move on —
yet is undemably ‘‘young”’ by
faculty standards. Still, Murphy
is content, developing friend-
ships with administrators and
students alike. Enjoying his uni-
que status as a “‘bridge’’ bet-
ween age groups, he concludes,
“T am perfectly satisfied with
the friendships that I have
now.”

Silver To Leave Lexington After 55 Years

(continued from page 15)

“Other than that, I just sit,”
he said.

“I get called for fraternity
scavenger hunts and parties,”’
said Silver. ‘‘I still like to do it.
I'll go and give them a little
show, and usually I'll have
them in stitches. I can’t walk
that much, though, so it’s not
that frequent anymore.”

“One time I remember was
when I was asked to go to a
fraternity house,”’ Silver said,’
“| didn’t want to walk the
distance so the young man call-
ed and paid for a cab.”

‘I’ve known a lot of people in
my time,” said Silver while
pulling out stacks of
photographs and newspaper
clippings.

“This one SayS to my pal -[r-
thur’signed John Warner. I have
pictures of my shop, my better
half, and acquaintances famous
or not.””

“These clippings are about
me. You see, it says right
there—e' a living legend? I
guess that figures. After all. I
was the smartest boy in my
class. Out of thirteen students

12 were girls. Can't read today,
though. I went to night school.
Oh, I can still keep them com-
ing.”

“There comes a time when
we all have to leave,” said
Silver. ‘‘I still don’t know where
I'll stay,” he added.

“I’ve got a lot of op-
portunities. Probably I'll go to
Rockville (Maryland) and live
with my brother. Or maybe to
Silver Spring to live with my
nephew. I’ve got until Tuesday
to get out,”’ Silver added

‘I think the students are a lit-
tle more behaved today,”’ Silver
said. ‘‘Everyone was just runn-
ing around and having a good
time back in the good old days.
Today there seems to be more
emphasis on studying. College
is too serious,”’ Silver said.

“You should be serious when
you go out into the real world.
It’s so much different out there.
You always have to look behind
you.”

“T never tell dirty jokes to
ladies,’ Silver said, “except
when I know they have peanut
butter legs. Once two ladies
came into the store and asked

me, ‘Mr. Silver, what are
peanut butter legs?’ (They're
easy to spread.) Well, I couldn't
keep a straight face. I may be
old, but I’ve got young ideas.”
‘Lexington has changed. The
people are different. Values
have shifted and there’s no
respect for the old,”’ he said. “A
new broom sweeps clean, but an

old one gets in the corners--
that’s something everybody
should keep in mind.”’

‘‘People have been good to me
and | appreciate it,’ said
Silver.

“For 40 years, Washington
and Lee was my bread and but-
ter. Without them I wouldn't
have existed. It’s time to move

Fraternities Under Fire

by David Greer

It looks like time could be run-
ning out for fraternities.

A proposal to ban fraternity-
sponsored (weekday) parties
and hazing was presented to the
faculty at its meeting Monday.

The proposal, drafted by Dr.
Edward Pinney, asks the Inter-
fraternity Council to ‘‘devise a
code of social and residential
behavior in fraternity houses”

- that would include conformity

to the noise ordinance, restric-
tions of parties sponsored by
fraternities to weekends, and a
ban on ‘‘hazing.”

%

me

According to the proposal,
violations of the code would
result in “‘penalties of social
probation of periods from a
minimum of 60 days to one full
semester.”

The proposal states that ‘‘it is
the opinion of the faculty that
the quality of fraternity house
life at the University has fallen,
in some cases, to degrading
levels inimical to the Universi-
ty‘s mission.”

According to Dean of
Students Lewis John, the pro-
posal has been sent to the IFC,
the University Council, and the
Student Affairs Committee. The
proposal is on the agenda for
the faculty meeting on May 6
and could be voted on then.

The proposal requests that
the code be submitted to the
faculty before May 20 ‘‘so that it
may be judged in time for the
last General Meeting of the
Faculty, the Baccalaureate
Meeting “‘

Dr. Edward Pinney o

It should be noted that the
Board of Trustees has given the

faculty the power to oversee

student life.

Pinney said that other
members of the faculty were in-
volved in the proposal. When
asked about his motives for
presenting the proposal and in-
cluding certain items in it, Pin-
ney said, ‘‘My motives are none
of your bloody business.”

Dr. Pinney is the faculty ad-
visor for Sigma Nu fraternity.

The proposal comes in the *

wake of a year of conflict bet-
ween the fraternities and the
faculty, police, townspeople,
and administration.

This year has seen many
fraternities issued summonses
for violation of Lexington’s
noise ordinance and fines im-
posed by the IFC for those
fraternities who were in viola-
tion.

The IFC placed restrictions
on fraternities’ partying in light
of the violations and attempts
were made to reach an agree-
ment to modify the law. The ci-
ty council would not act on the
issue and so the law stands. -

Concern from alumni, ad-
ministration, faculty, and
townspeople prompted monthly

. inspections of the conditions of

fraternity houses. Many houses
failed inspections and were
placed on social probation.

Specific fraternities have
been banned from holding func-
tions at some of the neighboring
women’s colleges.

The president of the Universi-
ty addressed the IFC about his
concern with deterioration of
fraternities and the fraternity
system.

One fraternity was placed on |

social probation for holding an
activity that supposedly in-
terferred with a _ pledge’s
schoolwork. Professors have
expressed concern about low at-
tendance of Thursday classes.

The proposal was met with
mixed reactions among the
faculty and students, but both
bodies are concerned about the
issue.

 

Faculty Proposal For Fraternity Conduct

Motion: That ;
I. The IFC shall undertake, before the end of this academic year, to devise a code of
social and residential behavior in fraternity houses, that must as a minimum include the
following rules and injunctions:

(1) “House Parties,” with or without live music, must be confined to. weekends
(Fridays and Saturdays) and must terminate at reasonable hours, i.e., no later than 1:00
a.m.

(2) All fraternity ‘‘hazing’”’ of pledges must be discontinued. ‘“‘Hazing’’ means any
house-sponsored activity that involves physical abuse such as paddling, verbal abuse
such as shouting, or any other grossly undignified behavior such as group shouting, jum-
ping up and down, soaking with water or other liquids, or repeated performance of ritual
exercise, blindfolded or-otherwise.

(3) Noise levels must be reduced, with particular attention to those occasions that ex-
tend into the evening hours, toa point consistent with local noise ordinances.

(4) The above paragraphs do not exhaust the subject of unacceptable behavior at
fraternity houses, but they should convey to the IFC the clear intent and tone of this
resolution.

II. It is not possible in this short statement to be comprehensively specific about accep-
table behavior. The meaning of “‘hazing,” for example, could be the subject of much
dispute. Still, it is the sense of the Faculty that the quality of fraternity house life at the
University has fallen, in some cases, to degrading levels inimical to the University’s mis-
sion. It specifically charges the IFC with responsibility for enforcement of these provi-
sions. It is our sincere hope that the IFC will be resolute and consistent in approaching
this duty and in meeting its responsibility for fraternity government conferred on the
IFC by faculty delegation ten years ago. Toward that end, House violations will carry
penalties of social probation of periods from a minimum of 60 days to one full semester, a
penalty to carry over into the next term if need be. As disagreeable as some of this may
be, any alternative solution to this pressing problem is almost certain to be far more
disagreeable... -

Please put together your code before the 20th of May and convey its contents to the
Secretary of the Faculty (Mr. Harold Head), so that it may be judged in time for the last
General Meeting of the Faculty, the Baccalaureate Meeting.

Syd Farrar
Reacts

“| knew it was coming, I was
not surprised,’”’ said Syd Far-
rar, the Interfraternity Coun-
cil’s newly elected president of
the faculty proposal to draw up
a code of ‘‘social and residential
behavior in fraternity houses.”’

Among Farrar’s complaints
with the proposal is its release
so close to exams and that the
motion’s drafters “never gave
the new IFC Judicial Board a
chance.”’

“I’m not saying that we (the
IFC) would have come up with
proposals as strict,” Farrar
said, “but I knew Wednesday
night parties would have to go,
in one form or another.”

Instead of eliminating week-
day parties completely, Farrar
is hopeful that they can be

Evans Dining Hall
To Be Expanded

Construction will. begin this
week on a $795,000 expansion of
the kitchen facilities in
Washington and Lee Universi-

ty’s Evans Dining Hall.
The project — which will be
completed before

undergraduate classes resume
in September — will add an
1,800-square-foot wing onto the
building between the existing
kitchen and a dormitory
building immediately to the
west. The addition will replace
a loading dock.

The facade of the new wing
will blend in with the line of
buildings along that side of
Washington Street from the
university’s Student Center
through the dormitory complex.

The expansion will effectively
double the size of the kitchen
facilities in Evans Hall. The
project is necessary, university
officials note, because Evans
was designed 20 years ago to
serve an average of 350 students
per meal, but today it in fact
serves an average of 600 to 650
per meal, and often as many as
800 at a time.

As a consequence, refrigera-
tion, food-storage, and bak-

ing.and cooking space had
become impossibly overcrowd-
ed and inadequate.

The $795,000 figure includes
$145,000 in new equipment.

Most of the construction
through mid-May will be on the

- outside, with no disruption of

regular food service in Evans.

Beginning soon after W&L’s
spring alumni reunions May 11
and 12, however, inside work is
expected to begin, and the
university will have to make a
number of accommodations to
keep service open.

To as great an extent as possi-
ble, the Evans Hall staff will
simply work around construc-
tion crews, according to Gerald
J. Darrell, manager of food ser-
vices at Washington and Lee.
That may include a_ con-
siderable amount of late-night
and early-morning food
preparation.

Some meals will be cooked in
the Cockpit, W&L’s restaurant
which is located in an adjoining
wing on the other side of Evans
Hall.

There will be a large number
of outdoor cookouts and

Professors Speak Out on Fraternities

Dr. Milton

Colvin

‘‘T believe fraternities can be
a very real and positive force on
a college campus and I’m not
opposed to fraternities per se,
but when fraternities abuse
their privileges or become a
refuge for those who wish to
prolong adolescence, or when
they simply become insensitive
to community norms, then they
should be shut down—and with
a bang,”’ said Dr. Milton Colvin
of the politics department.

Colvin, who was a member of
Zeta Psi fraternity at Yale
University, believes that some
of Washington and Lee’s frater-
nities have overstepped their

bounds and have become
‘insensitive to community
norms.”

‘I don’t want to deny frater-
nities their fun, I simply want to
keep it at a level of modera-
tion,’ Colvin said.

He used Delta Tau Delta as an
example of one of the bad
iraternities. ‘‘The Delt house
should be closed immediately ,”’
he said.

Colvin cited the use in public
of language ‘‘appropriate to a
platoon of recruits, not a com-
munity of women and children’”’
and litter around the fraternity
house as signs that the Delts
have a “‘lack of consideration
for their neighbors.”

‘Students are guests in Lex-
ington,’’ Colvin said. ‘‘They are
fortunate that they are in a
community that has a tolerance
for fraternity life, but that
tolerance has worn thin by
public drunkenness, destroying
furniture, litter, and a noise

 

level that is unconscionable at
certain times of the day.”’

He said that in his own frater-
nity ‘“‘we neither smashed fur-
niture or littered the premises,
but I do not believe that we
drank less.”

“Fraternities can be a place
where young men can learn to
be leaders and shoulder respon-
sibility,’ Colvin said. ‘“‘If
leadership goes by default, and
responsibility is shirked, then
the fraternity becomes an
adolescent playpen, and it is not
in the tradition of Washington
and Lee to encourage perpetual
adolescence.”’

‘My opinion is that if frater-
nities do not abide by the laws of
the community and do not abide
by the rules of the University,
then they have no business on
this campus,”’ Colvin said.

“It is up to fraternity leaders
to take charge and put their
houses in order,” he said. “If
not, they should be closed
without regret and without
remorse.”

But Colvin is not an advocate
of closing all fraternities
because of the behavior of a
few. ‘I don’t want to throw the
baby out with the bathtub,’’ he

(continued on page 6)

Dr. John Evans

“Fraternities, once upon a
time, served more than one
function at Washington and
Lee. They were a place of
refuge for those who were work-
ing very hard. They are now a
place for students to fill up emp-
ty time because they are not
working hard.”

So says Dr. John Maurice
Evans, English professor and
advisor to Phi Kappa Sigma
fraternity. Evans sees many
problems in the fraternity
system, but feels those pro-
blems are more deep-rooted
than just loud, late parties.

Evans says that fraternites
used to be ‘‘a training ground
for the upper middle class, the
ruling class. Fraternities are
now a playground.”

“I do not think fraternities
are a bad thing,” says Evans.
“They should be encouraged to
ripen and mature.”

Evans sees a problem stemm-
ing from the attitude toward
alchohol and the fact that the
social code for one to behave
oneself while drinking has all
but disappeared.

  

=

atte

‘In the old days, when liquor
was the main drug, gentlemen
were taught to hold their li-
quor.”’ Other drugs, especially
marijuana, replaced drinking
for a while, and so the tradition
of how to “drink like a man”’
disappeared. ‘Now drinking
has come back without the
tradition,” Evans says.
Formerly, upperclassmen
would supervise the younger
students when they were first
exposed to alchohol--usually in
college, as little drinking took
place in high school, he said.
“*The seniors are no longer ac-
ting to train the puppies, put
them to bed when they get ram-

Dr. Jay Cook

Dr. Jay Cook, accounting pro-
fessor at Washington and Lee,
says the fraternities are the
worst they’ve been in 26 years.

That’s how long he’s been
here as a professor. Cook was a
student here and a member of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

Cook said that the fraternity
situation ‘‘was very bad in the
early sixties. -The Dean of

Students was supposed to exer- —

cise control.’’ When he didn’t,
the faculty ‘‘set up a committee
and set very strict rules about
fraternity life.”

“The UC (University Coun-
cil) has done absolutely
nothing, so it’s about time the
power came back to the facul-
a

As for the faculty stepping in
to set rules for the fraternities,
Cook said, ‘‘If the students are
going to act in detriment to
their interests and the interests
of the. University, then we
should step in.”’

As for the recent proposal to
the faculty to restrict fraternity
activities, Cook said, “I have no
objection to the proposal.”’

Cook added, ‘“‘My Thursday
classes have been terrible’’ in

relation to attendance.

Cook objects to fraternity-
sponsored mid-week parties
because students pay for them
whether they go or not, and this
either encourages students to
neglect studies or forces
students to pay for something
they are not getting.

“Everybody in the fraternity
is charged, whether he goes or
not. This I object to — this is
anti-academic,”’ he said.

Cook believes that the
students have to face the conse-
quences of missed study time
and classes, but says, ‘‘I don’t
think they‘re old enough to face
this, especially the freshmen
and sophomores. I don’t think
they’re mature enough when
they get here.”’

Dr. Michael
Pleva

Dr. Michael A. Pleva,
Associate Professor of
Chemistry, feels changes need
to be made in the present frater-
nity system.

He feels that there should be
less pressure on incoming
freshmen to join a fraternity.
He believes that fraternity
rushing should be delayed until
the spring of the freshman year.
“That way he (the freshman)
gets a chance to know the place
before committing himself,”
Pleva stated. He added that
such a system worked at the
college he attended.

Also, he feels that fraternities
do not have the right to put “‘im-
mature’ freshmen through
something they cannot handle.
Pleva felt that most freshmen
can handle the various fraterni-
ty activities. But he is thinking
about those who have trouble
with studies and fraternity ac-
tivities, when he suggests the
delayed rush.

Pleva speculated that his sug-
gestion might “reduce the
number of pledges, but maybe
fraternities will treat the
pledges better,”’ he stated. He
added that not all fraternities
are that way.

Pleva_is against physical
abuse associated with pledging
a fraternity. He stated ‘‘I’m
afraid it will come down to
someone getting hurt or killed
before it all stops.’’ He added,
“There are other alternatives,
such as painting and repairing
the houses’ stuff that is not
physically abusive.”’

“From what I’ve seen and
heard of the present situation, I
am against it,” stated Pleva.

 

Correction

Last week’s article about the
resignation of W&L swimming
coach William J. Stearns er-
roneously implied that Stearns
had been evicting tenants from
his housing.

To clarify the record,
Stearns, to our knowledge, has
not evicted any tenants. In fact,
he has helped several of the peo-
ple living in his houses on Henry
Street (which we highlighted
several months ago) relocate.

The Ring-tum Phi regrets the
error and apologizes for any in-
convenience it may have caus-
ed Mr. Stearns.

For Stearns’ remarks on the
same article, see Letters to the
Editor, page 11.

The Ring-tum Phi Poll was con-
ducted by Randy Smith as his last
official act as News Editor before
leaving for Washington. Because
of space limitations only part of
the results can appear this week;
more will be printed this spring.

The Ring-tum Phi Student
Opinion Poll was conducted on
March 26 during the
Washington and Lee student
elections for class officers for
the academic year 1979-80.

The poll was available to
anyone who wanted to fill one
out and register his opinion.

Although the poll cannot be
taken as an accurate measure
of student opinion as a whole for
those three academic classes, it
is useful as a representative
sample of the opinions held by
those three groups.

Ring-tum Phi
Road Race

Preparations are now under-
way for the third annualRing-
tum Phi Road Race, to be held
on Sunday, May 6, announced
Jerry Darrell, this year’s chair-
man of the event.

Multiple sclerosis is the wor-
thy cause which benefits from
the time and energy of the run-
ners, and according to commit-
tee member Burr Datz, “total
involvement”’ is the goal for this
year’s marathon race. Towards
that end, the race is being
publicized in national running
magazines. In addition, all run-
ners on the 15 kilometer (9.3
miles) course will receive a free
tee-shirt.

A special two-mile race, the
“fun run,” will also be held fo
for those who cannot run the
longer course.

Letters have been sent out to
local businessmen requesting
their support this year, and two
law students, runners in the
Boston Marat Marathon, have
helped to plan the route of the
race, which will start and finish
at W&L’s Wilson Field. .

Trophies will be awarded to
the first, second, and third
place winners, along with other
prizes to be announced. Watch

The China Syndrome :

From movie theater to front page

by Dick Barron

No, The China Syndrome
hasn’t been to Lexington, and it
probably won’t be for some
time now, but your intrepid
reviewer drove to Roanoke
recently to see this most impor-
tant film. It’s truly amazing to
see this film about nuclear

nuclear accident near Har-

the most believable actress
working today.

Jack Lemmon, the supervisor
of the ‘‘Ventana”’ plant is no
Slouch either. In fact, if it’s
possible, he does a better acting
job than Fonda — his every
move is used with maximum ef-
fect.

eager photographer of the

waves for months to come.

 

risburg, Pa. Objectivity prac-
tically leaps out the window
because what was science fic-
tion at the film’s release has un-
fortunately become science fact
—a true life thriller.

Fictional Meltdown

If you haven’t heard already,
The China Syndrome, starring
Jane Fonda, Jack Lemmon,
and Michael Douglas depicts a
near meltdown at the fictitious
Ventana nuclear power plant
near Los Angeles. With nerve-
testing pace, the lights flash,
the ground shudders, people run
around like crazy, and the crisis
is eventually averted. The China
Syndrome deals not only with
the potential catastrophe, but
also with many of the touchy
issues surrounding the volatile
nuclear power industry. Many
questions about corporate and
media ethics are raised.

$12 million gross

The backwash from this film
has been immense. The March
30 Washington Post reports that
The China Syndrome grossed
$12 mil. in its first two weeks.
But even before release ‘“‘real-
life utility company lobbyists
launched a concerted effort to
downplay the credibility of the
movie.” And after the film’s
release, executives and _ lob-
byists got a big surprise when
the plant at Three Mile Island
threatened to self-destruct.

Regardless of the coinciden-
tal events of the past week, the
film itself deserves strong com-
mendation. As a thriller in its
own right, The China Syndrome
takes on a motion, a drive, a life
of its own as each harrowing
detail flashes past.

Jane Fonda

Jane Fonda is Kimberly
Welles, the T.V. feature
reporter who is looking for her
big story. Her zealous
character drives a_ hard
bargain, but she realizes soon
that there’s a bit more to the
problem than meets the eye.
Fonda has, in recent years,
become a major actress, giving
consistent and searing per-
formances — she’s just about

os

nuclear accident, luckily film-
ing inside the plant during the
event. His high energy
character burns throughout — a
man with a mission. Practically
every character is determined
to get his message across,
regardless of who or what gets

in the way. That adds insult to
injury as the characters battle
it out in and around the tower-
ing nuclear plant.

Director James Bridges must
be credited with a flawless job
in adding motion and rhythm to
a film which could have easily
fallen on its back. He uses the
superb cast to its fullest —
holding brightly lit shots when
necessary, adding quick cuts to
intensify strained situations,
and moving the camera with a
brilliant Hollywood high style.
Important to any film is con-
trast, visual or aural, and
Bridges ‘-has added these to
make this one of the most
visually entertaining and ex-
citing films since All the Presi-
dent’s Men. The China Syn-
drome is, hands down, a bright
achievement among the many
disappointments of the past
year. With the prospect of
nuclear accidents now a reality,
The China Syndrome will con-
tinue to radiate shock waves for
months to come. It’s a killer.

“Falstaff’’ soundtrack explained

Dear Editor:

We wish to take this opprotunity publicly to
express our regret for the difficulties in the
sound track of Orson Welles’ Falstaff, the
Film Society’s most recent movie. We were
told by the distributor that there would be
some problem with the sound, but we had no
idea how serious it would be. We would also
like to thank the many people who stayed for
the duration to enjoy the beauties of Welles’
visualization of Shakespeare’s material.

Welles has had an odd career, perhaps even
a tragic one. After the financial failure and
the legal threats surroundingCitizen Kane
(Randolph Hearst, on whom Kane was in part
modeled, attempted to block the movie's
release), the big studios refused to allow
Welles full artistic control over his projects,
and he made most of his subsequent films in-
dependently. Falstaff makes manifest some
of the hazards of independent film produc-

tion: the soundtrack was added after the com-

Glee Club Chronicles...

While most of you enjoyed
home life on our recent
Washington Holiday, the W&L
Glee Club followed a 2300-mile
concert tour through 7 southern
states. The tour was organized
by Dr. Gordon Spice, director,
and was facilitated greatly by
the cooperation of W&L alumni
and friends along the way. The
University’s ‘‘singing am-
bassadors’’ performed to en-
thusiastic audiences in Chapel
Hill and Raleigh, North
Carolina; Rome, Georgia; and
Jackson, Mississippi during the
week-long Washington Holiday
tour.

The tour began in Chapel Hill,
where the club was greeted by
the worst blizzard to hit that
area in 31 years. The group’s
chartered bus literally plowed
its way to Raleigh where a joint
concert with Meredith College
was scheduled. Classes were

cancelled at Meredith, resulting
in numerous opportunities for
W&L men and Meredith women
to try sledding, building snow-
persons and otherwise to enjoy
a southern version of Dart-
mouth’s ‘‘Winter Carnival.”
The evening’s concert was held
on schedule and featured the
combined choirs performing
Haydn’s ‘“‘Te Deum’ (with
piano accompaniment
substituting for a snowed-in or-
chestra).

After the blizzards of North
Carolina, the singers headed
south and west, to the Darl-
ington School in Rome,
Georgia, where an enthusiastic
audience heard the glee club
and Southern Comfort perform
an hour-long program, climax-
ed, as usual, by a rousing rendi-
tion of ‘“The Swing.”

weary singers, a city where
Southern hospitality prevailed.
Following a short program for
the Galloway United Methodist
Church, the club performed two
hour-long concerts at Jackson
Preparatory School and St. An-
drew’s Episcopal School.
Receptions for all three pro-
grams were enthusiastic and
the group was particularly
pleased with the friendliness ac-
corded them at Jackson’s two
fine preparatory schools.

Having sung six concerts in
five days, the glee club was
ready for some “‘rest and relax-
ation.”’ Being a mere four-hour
drive away, what could have
been more inviting than two
days in New Orleans! Despite
torrential rains and_ the
cancellation of Mardi Gras
parades, the W&L fun-seekers
were not to be denied.
“Breakfast at Brennan’s’’ was
followed by oysters at Felix’s,
cocktails at Anything Goes, jazz
at Preservation Hall and final-
ly, sing-alongs at Pat O’Brien’s.
(It was observed on two suc-
cessive evenings that the latter
establishment was almost
“taken over’ by W&L types,
resulting in unprecendented
repetitions of the W&L Swing! )

Reluctantly, the club left the
“crescent city’ to return to
books, studying and the rigors
of academia, stopping over-
night in Atalnta to release
whatever steam was left. They
disembarked the bus on campus
(in the rain, naturally) ex-
hausted, suffering severe cases
of ‘‘bus-lag.”’ but filled with
happy memories of the week-
long musical sojourn to the
south.

The concert tour accomplish-
ed two purposes, according to
Dr. Spice. ‘‘We made students,
alumni and friends aware of
Washington and Lee by our con-
certs and we solidified the glee
club by living together literally
24 hours-a-day for a week.
Whether singing a Renaissance
motet in the chapel at Darl-
ington or raising glasses to the
strains of ‘Vive l’amour’ in the
upper reaches of Atlanta’s
Peachtree Plaza, the W&L Glee
Club is something of which the
University can be very proud.”’

Tonio K.
Life in the Foodchain
Epicll Moon

About a week ago I was look-
ing through one of our rival
music publications and I came
across a review which said
something to the effect that a
man named Tonio K. had just
made the greatest album ever
recorded. So, despite a tenden-
cy on my part to be wary of such
claims (remember Devo), I
knew this was one I had to
check out.

Well, Life in the Foodchain
may not be the greatest album
ever recorded, but it is without
a doubt the funniest, raun-
chiest, and most stimulating
record I’ve heard in a long time.
Tonio K. has Americanized the
New Wave to the point where he
sounds like a cross between Lou
Reed and Jackson Browne if the
two of them had been locked in
a room together for three mon-
ths with nothing to sustain them
but 500 hits of LSD.

The album itself is organized
around a line in the title song
which talks about “‘life in the
foodchain’’ and “love among
the ruins.’’ Side one, subtitled
‘life in the foodchain,” presents
a series of little scenarios of
American life, similar (at least
as far as the lyrics go) to the

type of street dramas you would
expect from Tom Waits or
Bruce Springsteen.

Good as side one is (and in
spots its nothing short of in-
credible), it can’t help but seem
like a warm-up for side two,
which is probably the best con-
ceptual album side since side
two of Bruce Springsteen’s
“The Wild, the Innocent, and
the E Street Shuffle.’’ Tonio’s
vision of “love among the
ruins,’’ presumably meaning
the ruins of American society in
the ‘70’s, includes a love song to
a suspected vampire, threats to
physically destroy his woman if
she leaves him, and a song call-
ed ‘“‘H-A-T-R-E-D’’ which is
beyond any sort of description.

The only thing that worries
me about Tonio K. is that he
might follow the same path as
Warren Zevon and other similar
performers, who have found it
difficult if not impossible to sus-
tain the novelty of their humor
beyond the length of one album.
If he can do it (and my money
says that he can), forget rock‘n-
roll — he could well end being
the future of the world! (If
nothing else, it will be in-
teresting to see how John
Rockwell and the rest of the
folks at the New York Times
handle him — somehow, Mr. K.
jsut doesn’t cut it.)

Professors React

James
Boatwright

James Boatwright, professor
of English, says he sees more
parties that are noisier and go
on longer to be the problem fac-
ing fraternities and the source
of anti-fraternity feelings.

“It’s bad from the point of
view for those who live around
it and in so far as it affects the
performance of students, ‘‘ he
said.

‘‘What’s happening here
seems to be part of a pattern,”
he added. “It’s happening at
U.Va.’ it’s happening at Dart-
mouth.”

“Fraternities ought to
restrain themselves. There
should be more of a public sense
of themselves.”’

Boatwright, who was an SAE
at. the University of Georgia,
said, ‘‘My own fraternity was
not any more dignified or
gentlemanly than those around
here, but we didn’t party as
much. What we certainly didn’t
do was trash the house.”’

‘‘T think there are more pro-

blems with noise, with late par-.

ties,”’ said Boatwright, who has
been teaching here for 19 years.

‘Fraternities could find ways
to make the parties less noisy,
to make them end at a
reasonable time.”’

Boatwright points out that
students now have a greater
capacity for making noise in
that a student with a good

stereo can play music that

covers an entire block, even if .

   

 

he’s not having a party. This
was not likely in his day, he
says.

“I don’t have any objection to
parties one way or another,” he
said. ‘‘A student ought to have
the freedom of choice to do his
work or not do his work, and
face the consequences.”

The problem with mid-week
parties is that many students
feel they have to attend them
because they are paying for
them, he says.

‘‘Mid-week parties have
become an established institu-
tion, or at least that’s the way
students seethem’.”

Colvin

(continued from page 2)
said.

He also said that he is willing
to give fraternities some time
correct their problems. ‘One
has to allow time for change,”’
Colvin said. But he made it

_ Clear that time was running out.

“Where is the leadership in
the fraternities?’ he asked.
“And why don’t they throw the

troublemakers out?”

with hazing and the recom-

“Fraternity members will
say, ‘the faculty is forcing us to

“It would have been much

The Interfraternity Council
distributed copies of the faculty
proposal prohibiting mid-week
parties to the fraternities Tues-
day night.

IFC president Syd Farrar
asked the representatives to
take the proposal back to their
fraternities and return. with
comments and_ constructive
criticism.

Farrar hopes to address the
faculty about the proposal at its
next meeting. However, the on-
ly student that may address the
body is the student body presi-
dent.

Farrar said that if he cannot
speak to the faculty he will ask
Student Body President Beau
Dudley, to do it.

In other business, Farrar said

 

that members of the alumni in-
spection committee here last
week told him that they were
“really pleased”’ with the condi-
tion of the fraternity houses and
were “pleasantly surprised.”
He said that some alumni ex-
pressed desire to help the
fraternities; Farrar said he
suggested they help the frater-
nities financially.

The IFC voted to allow Don
Swagart, next year’s rush
chairman, to fill in for senior
justice Mike Mrlik for the Spr-
ing Term while Mrlik is in
Japan.

It was also announced that

dependents, who can buy
tickets for $5 single-$7.50 cou-
ple. There will be 300 tickets
sold to non-fraternity members.

Profs
John M.
McDaniel

The threat of ‘“‘consumption”’
and the threat of alienating the
citizens of Lexington are two of
the major problems facing the
fraternity system. at
Washington and Lee, according
to Dr. John M. McDaniel.

McDaniel, who has_ been
teaching anthropology at W & L
for seven years, was student
here and a member of Delta.
Tau Delta.

“Fraternities could consume
students and be a threat to a
student’s academic affairs, but
are a threat only,’’ McDaniel
said. :

There are other forces that
can consume a student, he add-
ed.

“There is a need to look into
the situation,’’ he said. ‘‘Some
measure of attention has to be
exercised before relations with
the town further deteriorate.”

McDaniel says that not all
fraternities are a problem and
some are a problem’ only at
times.

_ ‘My concern is how do you
keep students from being con-

_ sumed by the attention of the

fraternities.”

McDaniel says that in some
instances “there has been a
decline in the care of the pro-
perty of the fraternities.”

McDaniel believes that where -
changes are needed, “it must
come from within the frater-
nities. If the fraternities are go-
ing to survive, they must en-
courage performance in the
academic realm.”’

Despite problems, McDaniel
feels that the fraternities can .
add much to a student’s life and
development.

bunctious,”” he says. ‘‘Socializ-
ing boys into men does not go
n.’’ Evans does not support the
idea of fraternity-sponsored
parties during the week.

“I have faced Thursday mor-
ning classes with hungover peo-
ple until I am not willing to do it
any more,”’ he says.

‘‘ Fraternities should not be
allowed to organize a formal

_ social event during the week,”’

Evans said, but he adds that he
has no objections to informal
parties during the week.
“Spending fraternity money
makes it (the party) an in-
vested thing to go down and get
a part of. There should be
severe penalties for organized
social functions.’’ Evans sees
the problem lying in cases
where a student who has study-
ing to do might neglect the stu-

‘ dying to attend a party he has

paid for.

Speaking on Cockpit bands
during the week, Evans said,
“There should be no tempta-
tions at the university during
the week.”’

There are short-comings in
the academic atmosphere at
WA&L, he feels, that are showing
themselves in fraternity pro-
blems.

“There is no social pressure
to be intellectual; there is great
social pressure to be anti-
academic,”’ he says.

Generals drop Brown

12-11 in

by Doug Linton

Each team’s goalie had 15
saves amid the pouring rain,
but the Bruins’ keeper let one
too many slip past him, as the
Generals edged Brown Univer-
sity 12-11 in overtime, yester-
day, on Wilson Field. Jeff Fritz
won the game for W&L with
1:22 left in the first sudden
death period, scoring with the
assist of a John Black pass in a
double man-up situation. This
victory, which ties the series
record with Brown at 1-1, was
the second such overtime win
for the Generals this season.

The Generals held an early
3-0 lead. Jay Foster assisted
Black, before Foster went on to
score an assisted goal himself.
After Fritz had the third tally,
the Bruins got their first. Foster
then scored his second, taking.a
pass from Fritz. Brown
responded with one more, but so
did Foster, who netted his third
goal of the quarter following a
pass from John Kemp. The
Bruins got one more to end the
period’s scoring at 5-3.

Brown narrowed the gap to
only one goal, scoring within 20
seconds of the second quarter.
Then it was John Hooper who,
for the second time in two
games, sparked a four goal stint
for the Generals. Foster had his
second assist, finding Hooper
open, to make it 7-4, and then
Fritz followed with still another
unassisted tally. After
Staugaitis’ second assist made
its way to Geoff Brent, who put
it in the back of the net, the
Generals were enjoying a 9-4
halftime lead. Most felt that the
game was in the bag, but the
men from Brown had other
ideas.

The third quarter was a long
and sloppy one, seeing each
team add only one goal to their
totals. The Generals’ tally came
from Black’s second goal, off of
Foster’s third assist.

W&L led 10-5 going into the
last period of play, and they
almost lost it. But as Coach
Jack Emmer will tell you, along
with the rest of his squad,
almost doesn’t count! Brown
had the first word of the
quarter, and then the second
word also, to make it 10-7. San-
dy McDonald responded with an
unassisted score to give the
Generals a four goal lead. But
the Bruins, trying to make their
long trip to Virginia worth-

day’s 12-11 win over Brown.

while, then began their come-
back. After successfully netting
three unanswered goals and
closing the score to 11-10, Brown
charged toward the General
goal one more time. It was a
four on three situation, but the
Bruins’ shot went off the pipe.
Rick Handelman picked the ball
up for Brown and had to make
four fakes before firing the ball
past Bob Clements to tie the
game at 11 all with only 1:57 left
to play. W&L’s last attempts to
score in the quarter were refus-
ed. Brown charged downfield
once more, even changing mid-
dies on the fly, but Clements
made a nice save to force the
game into overtime. But Brown
made one crucial mistake in
slashing defender Dave Nickels
with only a second left in the
quarter. This meant that the
Generals would enjoy a man-up
situation at the start of the sud-
den death period.

Kemp took the first shot in
overtime, but it was saved by
the Brown keeper. Black in-
terfered with the goalies clear
attempt, so the Bruins got the
ball at midfield. After W&L
pressured a bad pass, they
cleared the ball and shot once
more, but again in vain.

The big break came at 1:33.
Fritz was slashed, which would
have put the Generals a man-up
once more. Things couldn’t be
better, right? Wrong! The
referee then slapped a Brown
player with unsportsmanlike
conduct, which gave W&L a two
man advantage!Now _ things
couldn’t be better, and Fritz,
along with the rest of the
Generals, knew it, as he bounc-
ed a Black assist past the
Brown keeper for the winning
strike and his fourthScore of the
day.

When asked about the
pressure of shooting in over-
time, with the possibility of
turning the ball over to the
other team, Fritz simply
remarked, “You don’t think
about missing.” Fritz, who now
has 16 goals, trailing scoring
leader Black by four, was
awarded the game ball for his
efforts.

Coach Emmer said to
remember one thing - ‘“We won,
no matter how we did it!’’ He
feels that the squad is ‘‘a much
better team than we were
earlier in the season.’’ This is
good, because the road ahead is
going to be tough. But Emmer
feels confident that his club can
play with anybody.

Also win 13-7

 

 

 

 

by Doug Linton

Both the offense and the
defense were awesome as the
Generals more than tamed the
Tigers of Towson State by a
score of 13-7 on Saturday. This
was their eighth straight win
over Towson, and W&L now
leads the series 16-10.

The Generals got off to a slow
start as they fell behind early.
John Hooper had the first goal
for the squad off a John Black
pass, with Black himself netting
‘the Generals’ second, assisted
by Joe Olive. W&L fell one shy
of Towson’s early tallies and
trailed 3-2 at the end of the first
quarter. But that was the last
lead that the Tigers enjoyed for
the rest of the day.

The Generals tied the game at
3-3 early in the second period
when Rob Staugaitis found
Black open during an.extra man
situation. Jay Foster then fed
John Kemp, who gave the
Generals their first lead in the
game. W&L then scored their
third consecutive goal of the
period as Jeff Fritz netted one
unassisted. Towson bounced
back to score two more, the se-
cond being a man-up goal, to tie
the game at five apiece.
Staugaitis got his second feed of
the day on a crucial pass to
Jerry Broccoli, who scored an
equally crucial goal to give W &
L a 6-5 halftime lead, one that
they would not relinquish.

The Generals opened the
scoring of the third quarter as
Foster gave his second assist to
Black, who netted his third of
the game. Fritz then scored his

second unassisted goal and it

THE

  

Swimming season:

a final look

A Commentary
by Mike Foley
Some may view the 1978-79 swimming season as unsuccessful.
This view is accurate only when one contrasts this team with the
extraordinary success of Coach Stearns’ squads in past years and
one refuses to recognize that the opponents they faced were
scholarship-ladden Division I schools. Although the swim team lost
blue chippers John Hudson, W&L’s only national champion, and
Dave Kent, a two time state champion, the swimmers finished the
season with a 27th place finish in the Division III National Cham-
pionships. Over 300 schools are members of the NCAA Division III.
To top off Coach Stearn’s final year at W&L, Drew Pillsbury of
Grosse Point, Michigan has earned All-American distinction for the
first time in his career. Pillsbury finished in 6th place in the 200
yard backstroke which missed Dave Kent’s school record by less
than .4 of a second. The junior backstroker also gained All-
American honors in the 100 yd. backstroke, finishing in 11th palce.
Earlier this year, Pillsbury was selected as a member of the

Virginia State Tournament water polo team, in which he led the

W&L team in scoring. He was also water polo co-captain.

Joining Pillsbury was Swim Team co-captain Chip Hoke of Rich-
mond, Va. who earned All-American distinction for the 4th time in
his career. Hoke swam his best race of the year in the 1650, in
finishing in 11th place.

The biggest disappointment of the meet was the failure of senior
co-captain Keith Romich to add to his All-American honors.
Romich, a six time All-American, went on a special diet 3 weeks
before the Nationals as did freshman Mike Bernot. Side effects
from the diet rather than benefits resulted in Romich’s worst na-
tional performance since he has been at W&L. It is indeed tragic to
have this team leader’s illustrious career end in disappointment.
Among the other honors Romich has earned are All-East in water
Polo 1978, 1st team All-Southern Conference 1978 (water polo), 4
time Virginia State Tournament team, water polo captain twice,
MVP twice and swimming MVP for 1979. The swimming and water
polo teams will sorely miss his presence next season.

Promising performances were turned in by Bob Newcomb in the
50 free, Freshmen Mike Bernot and Herb Gresens in the freestyle
relay and diver Jay Diesing.

The head coaching job being vacated by Coach Stearns has at-
tracted some highly regarded applicants. Most notably is Page
Rohmillard, of Claremont-Mudd College in California, who has ex-
pertise in both swimming and water polo. Other applicants are the
head coach of Fordham University of New York City, an assistant
from University of Alabama and the head coach of Madison
University. An excellent water polo coach has also applied from
Occidental College in California.

by Chris Sisto

Despite the varsity baseball’s
3-6 record and their 1-3 showing
of last week head coach Chuck
Kroll is very optimistic about
the future success of the team.
“T’m enthusiastic about this
team. We’re a hustling ball club
and we are improving every
day. We are going to do fine
over the rest of the season.”’

The Generals started last
week with a 5-0 loss to
Bridgewater College, partly
caused by an absent hitting at-
tack. The silent bats continued
for the team as they then lost a
3-0 game to Liberty Baptist Col-
lege. Vic Shepherd pitched well
for the Generals, allowing only
one earned run.

Then Sunday on Smith field,
the Generals split a conference
doubleheader with Hampden-
Sydney, winning the first game
4-2 and dropping the second, 9-5.

Baseball Generals
Still “In the Season”

Prior to the first game the
Generals had never beaten
Sydney. But the tempo was set
early in the first game as the
Generals came up with three
runs in the first inning. Rich
Hachenburg pitched masterful-
ly, allowing only four hits in the
game. Coach Kroll later said
that, “Rich was in complete
control of the game at all time.”’
In the second game the
Generals could not overcome a
barrage of late-inning runs by
Sydney that wiped out a fourth
inning two run lead. Jeff Hag-
gerty was 3-3 at the plate and
had three RBI’s.

Overall, Coach Kroll said,
“My guys have a lot of
pride...we’re a long way from
being out of this season. We
have two very important weeks
ahead of us and I think we’ll do
fine.” In ODAC play the
Generals are now 2-4.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK ST Ix VILLE = eases cy)

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Perspectives-

The recent faculty proposal to curb fraternity “hazing,” week-
day parties, and public drunkenness hit the student body like a
bombshell on Monday. As recently as last week, a substantial
number of W&L students (while responding to the Ring-tum Phi
poll) stated that they saw no danger threatening their fraternity
system. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The pot has boiled over
toa crisis level; criticism of fraternities is at an all-time high in the
community, among the faculty, even at the nearby women’s col-
leges. Still, it may not be too late for the fraternities to recover lost
ground if rapid steps are taken.

Since Professor Pinney’s motion hit the campus, the common
fraternity sentiment has been one of betrayal. ““How can our
teachers oppose their own students?” we have heard. ‘‘Some of my
favorite professors support this proposal.” Perhaps students
should remember that the faculty are full-time members of the
Lexington community as well. Not only have they borne the
frustration of sparsely-attended Thursday classes, but also they
receive constant exposure to public cursing and destruction of pro-
perty. Like the rest of the community, the W&L faculty feel that the
students simply don’t care about their responsibilities to the town.
In turn, the students may have misinterpreted faculty patience as
an equal lack of care. But no longer — as one faculty member said,
“I can’t even take my family toa lacrosse game...We are not going
to let them do that to us, and we have the power to stop it.”

Many faculty members are fraternity men, and continue to sup-
port a well-ordered system on the campus. They don’t view this
proposal as an attempt to shut down fraternities but as a last-ditch
effort to make students realize the ‘‘substantial” sentiment against
them. Even prospective students are being frightened away by this
uproar — as one official stated, ‘“They don’t want 4 years of what
they saw in Animal House.”’ That movie was made as a caracature
of fraternity life, but when it becomes the example— and leads to
the eclipse of W&L’s academic reputation — corrective measures
are bound to be harsh.

Right now, it’s hard for the faculty to find much good at all in
fraternities. But there are still arguments for the system ', which
professors should remember as they hammer out a final solution.
Almost everyone has admitted that there are various degrees of
guilt among the houses, and that it does seem unfair to make all
suffer equally. Also, the recent alumni inspections brought
favorable (if surprised) compliments on the physical inprovements
of the houses. The fraternities— to give them their due — often try
really hard to co-operate with the community. Only when the city
council refused any bending of the noise ordinance, did a resigned
return to the ‘‘old rowdiness’’ occur. Most of all, faculty members
should be aware that fraternities — for good or ill — are still power-
ful drawing cards for incoming freshmen, even now. If all
autonomy is whipped out of the system, it is hard to see any recrea-
tional medium in our thriving metropolis which could take its
place.

Hopefully, some of these thoughts will be remembered as the
sides square off for this latest encounter. No one can doubt the
reality of the present threat — but we can hope that tempers will
cool and reason prevail before a final decision is reached.

“Lacrosse fever ”’

Dear Editor:

As the heart of the lacrosse season is upon
us, we think it would be worthwhile for all of
us to take note of a few facts. For whatever
reason, “lacrosse fever’? seems to be on a
slight decline this year. To be sure, the team
had two very tough losses to Syracuse and
UNC, but the team is deserving of more from
us as fans. Instead of cheering for our own
team it seems that many of us sit in stunned
silence when we’re not ahead by 10 goals, and
wait for each opportunity to ‘dump on’’ the
other team and its coaches. There are no pat-
sies on the W&L schedule; the team needs our
support and we ought to’ give it to them in-
stead of wasting time giving the other side
grief.

More important is the effect our manner of
cheering has on other teams. Like it or not the
Naval Academy will not schedule us in
lacrosse because of the obscene verbal abuse
given their coach and his wife while last in

victims - watch those cheers!

Lexington. The word is spreading and we
could be in real danger of losing future games
against top competition if we can’t ‘‘clean up
our act.’”’ There isn’t a thing W&L can do
when a biggie says ‘‘Sorry, we’re not coming
to Lexington,’’ except look around for a lesser
opponent. Needless to say, nobody wants to
see a schedule full of Kutztowns and Bowling
Greens, so let’s make sure we don’t cause that
problem to arise.

The Wahoos come to town on April 22 for the
annual battle, and what a shame it would be
to lose the opportunity to thrash them in the
future. We don’t have to love the ‘‘Hoos,”’ but
we ought to be able to act decently while
beating the hell out of them. The message
comes down to this: From here on out let’s
keep the cheering loud and keep it clean.
Otherwise, we will be the losers regardless of
the score.

Thanks,

R.E. Lee elderly residents defended

Mr. Gray Coleman, Editor
The Ring-tum Phi
Washington and Lee University

I would like to express my extreme disap-
pointment with the insensitive and morally
repugnant manner in which Clyde Mull, pro-
prietor of the College Inn and new owner of
the R. E. Lee Hotel, has treated several long-
time tenants. As known by readers of
theRing-tum Phi and many Lexington
citizens, the R. E. Lee has been the home of
several elderly people, most of whom are on
fixed incomes. Because of a substantial in-
crease in their rents next year, these people,
most of whom have no relatives in the area,
are being forced into the frightful position of
needing to find a new place to stay. The lack
of suitable low cost housing in Lexington is
common knowledge among students, so most
of us can get a slight feeling for what it must
be like to be elderly and suddenly be left
without a roof over one’s head.

Mr. Mull has made clear that he is just:a
businessman out to make a profit. Even
though claiming to incerase the Hotel rents to

Georges

Hairstylist

a competitive level, he seems to be raising
them well above what the rather unim-
pressive facilities are worth. One begins to
wonder whether or not the loss of these
tenants is such a business enhancing move
after all.

Since I lived in the Hotel my freshman year,
I am well aware of all the non-financial
benefits that other tenants of the hotel receive
from their presence. Certainly, returning
from a hard day of classes to be greeted with
warm affection gave all of us a good feeling
inside. Having someone there all of the time
also made us feel a great deal more secure
knowning that our rooms were safe in our
absence. These people made us feel at home.

Now these loyal friends of W&L and Lex-
ington are being forsaken at the whim of a
capricious businessman. However, I have to
wonder if profits are going to grow at as rapid
a rate as indignation resulting from their
plight. For one, I have to believe that these
elderly people will not be the only losers in the

deal.

To the Editor,

I'd like to tell all you people
who participated or observed
the dance marathon that I
thoroughly supported the cause
and was impressed by the en-
thusiasm and spirit that the
group maintained. I am new to
this area having lived in the
county for about a year. I
wanted to enter the marathon at

the start but circumstances |

prevented me from doing so.
The next best thing was to come
when I could. I danced the last
five hours of the marathon and I
felt pretty weak in the knees, so
I congratulate all those who

persisted, sweated, and held out —

to the very end.

. But one thing upset me ter-
ribly. The Wet Tee Shirt Con-

test. I’d heard about such low,

oppressive entertainment but

had never witnessed it. Part of

me was unbelieving that it was

to actually happen; I believed
W & L consciousness and men-
tality was higher than most
smoke filled bars, so I got close
to observe. What I saw affected

ay.
me so that tears began to cloud
my eyes. I felt very offended,
repulsed and angered. Four
women, one at a time, pranced

about flaunting their bodies in
wet tee shirts competing
against each other to see which
of them had the most prominent
well shaped breasts. Mostly

men and some women formed a

Stearns Criticizes Resignation Account

To the Editor:

I have some questions regar-
ding Bill Whalen’s March 29th
article about my resignation
from Washington and Lee.

First, since this season was
(to quote Mr. Whalen) ‘“‘...the
first time in five years that a
W&L swim team has failed to
crack the top ten for Division III
teams,” does it necessarily
follow that the season was a
‘stormy’? one? Mr. Whalen’s
use of the word implies conflict
and controversy which the
mere fact of a team’s not plac-
ing in the top ten does not
substantiate. Besides where is
any mention of this season’s two
team members who achieved
All-American status at the Divi-
sion III championships?

Furthermore, why doesn’t the
Ring-tum Phi make it known
that our Division III swim team
competed almost entirely
against subsidized Division I
colleges this season? The swim
team through the years has con-
sistently challenged a tough
Division I schedule. Despite
this, where does the Ring-tum
Phi note that the swim team has
the highest winning percentage
of any team in W&L history or
of its 15 All-Americans. Why
does the Ring-tum Phi em-
phasize this one “‘disappoin-
ting’? season instead of

crediting our swim team with
its fine competitive efforts and
publicizing the successes which
were made?

It does seem odd that a stu-
dent newspaper would detract
from the accomplishments of
its fellow-student athletes by
focusing so heavily on the
losses. Could it be that the Ring-
tum Phi is not really interested
in accomplishments, but is
more intent upon trying to imp-
ly the possibility of some
disreputable connection _ bet-
ween this season’s ‘‘disappoin-
ting performance’ and my so-
called ‘‘sudden resignation’’? I
suppose, when one thinks about
it, this would be more titillating
copy for readers.

Second, is it really true (to
quote Mr. Whalen again) that
the ‘...Coach himself drew
criticism from _ local
newspapers for his controver-
sial housing practices...?’’ or is
it more specifically true that
the single W&L_ student
newspaper, The Ring-tum
Phi,chose to direct its attention
in a single article to my housing
practices? And is it not true that
other newspaper involvement
amounted to one “‘letter to the
editor,” a letter written in
response to the Ring-tum Phi
article?

Third, does my conversation
with athletic director William
McHenry three months ago
(last December) about the
possibility of my leaving W&L
constitute a ‘‘sudden’’ resigna-
tion? Perhaps, if Mr. Whalen
had actually interviewed Mr.
McHenry instead ot merely bor-
rowing a quotation from a news
release (without proper
reference to the source), Mr.
Whalan would have discovered
that Mr. McHenry and I
originally discussed a formal
resignation decision to be of-
fered in mid-April this year.
Perhaps if Mr. Whalen had ac-
tually asked the appropriate
questions of the people involv-
ed, he would have learned too,
that my formal announcement
came a month early (in March)
because at that t point I was ina

44622446 seaeeteeaeet

position to arrange an interview
between W&L and an excellent
candidate as my successor.

Is it possible that the Ring-
tum Phi really does not know
much about the circumstances
of my resignation?

Finally, the Ring-tum Phi
clearly raises the question of a
possible connection between the
swim team’s “‘disappointing
performance”’ this season, my
“sudden resignation,” and my
“‘interest”’ in coaching the team
this year. But if the Ringtum
Phi really does think this is an
important issue, I wonder why
Mr. Whalen has not included
statements to that effect from
the two men who evaluate my
professional performance —
athletic director William
McHenry and President Robert
E.R. Huntley? Has Mr. Whalen
asked Mr. McHenry and Presi-
dent Huntley or my swimmers
whether or not they think I have
fulfilled my commitment to the
swim team?

Or is it more likely that Mr.
Whalen’s article about my
resignation represents an ex-
ample of incompelte knowledge
turned into journalistic innuen-
does designed for public pro-
vacation rather than enlighten-
ment? I do not think Mr.
Whalen has investigated the
issue of my resignation very
well, and consequently, I’m
sure the Ring-tum Phi does not
object to my questioning its

ploited.

I really object to this type of
“good fun,’’ especially in the
name of a Muscular Dystrophy
Fund-Raiser Dance Marathon.
The contest was in very poor
taste and in support of destruc-
tive social conditioning of this
sexist society. For myself I felt
these women obviously needed
to get eyeball attention and
recognition, and inacturately
represented and reflected the
emale sex.

By writing this article I hope
to reach some of you out there
who encouraged, promoted, or
participated in the WET TEE
SHIRT CONTEST. I can only
trust that there are many more
men and women who felt the
same as I did and that next year
it will be left out of this other-
wise excellent fund-raising
event.

Students Defend Fraternities
in Wake of

Faculty Proposal

Dear Editor:

The initial outrage which ac-
companied my reading of the
faculty proposal to restrict the
social life (i.e. no weeknight
parties and limited weekend
parties) of fraternity members
has subsidied into a controlled
rage. Once again, the role of
fraternities at Washington and
Lee is being called into ques-
tion. Asked to limit weeknight
partying to one night per week,
fraternities complied. Asked to
turn down the music at parties
by a certain hour fraternities,
albeit somewhat - hesitantly,
complied. I dare say that the
Alumni Committee which
recently scrutinized the
physical condition of all frater-
nity houses on campus was, I
am told, favorably impressed.
Such a result could only come
about through a united fraterni-
ty commitment of time, effort
and money. To imply that the
conditions of fraternity: life here
are idyllic would be a'mistake.
On the other hand, to suggest
that the fabric of the fraternity
system has deteriorated to a
point where radical measures
such as those proposed by the
faculty must be adopted is in
my opinion, a far greater
mistake.

At an institution like W&L the

coping with the pressures which
the unbounded freedoms found
outside these walls inevitably

available. An intricate part of
achieving this maturity is lear-
ning how to balance the intellec-
tual and social aspects of life
here. What the motion before
the Faculty proposes to do is
eliminate the student’s chance

- to achieve that balance by

himself. In the place of the stu-
dent’s attempt at self-discipline
will come faculty restrictions
which will retard this growth
process by limiting, to a large
extent, the student’s freedom of
choice.

What would seperate us, if
such measures were ever to be
implemented, from’ our
neighbors at VMI who labor
under a barrage of rules and
regulations? The major dif-
ference is, obviously, that VMI
cadets choose this regimented
lifestyle. A student coming to
W&L chooses the school mainly
for its academic excellence
and, secondly, for its adequate
social life. W&L presently of-
fers the student a large degree
of freedom in choosing not only
his academic pursuits, but his
individual lifestyle as well. If
such strict measures are passed
and enforced, ultimately
resulting in almost a complete
lack of this social freedom, we
are certain that many students
will “‘choose’’ not to come here
and some may choose not to re-
main. We ask only ask that the
faculty look closely before leap-
ing.

And the university has ar-
ranged to ‘“borrow’’ the use of
kitchen facilities at Virginia
Military Institute if the need
arises, he said.

The final day of the W&L
school year is June 7, so the
change in food-service patterns
will last only- three weeks or
slightly longer, Darrell said.

The new addition will consist
of a 66-x-32-foot building. A

and the dormitory just to the

will be located behind the ex-
isting breezeway which leads

Rental List
Being
Prepared

The Office of University ser-
vices at Washington and Lee is
preparing a master list of rental
properties available to students
for the 1979-80 academic year.

The list will be made
available to undergraduates
and law students who will then
make arrangements directly
with the landlords.

The university has invited all
prospective landlords to pro-
vide information for inclusion
on the student housing list.
There is no charge for the ser-
vice. The university has asked
that landlords provide a com-
plete description of the rental
property, a description of fur-
nishings which may be included
in the terms of the rental agree-
ment, special advantages the
property may offer, restrictions
which the landlord imposes,
and full information about
costs, including length of lease
and whether the landlord or the
student pays for utilities.

The information should be
sent to W&L’s Office of Univer-
sity Services in writing.

The university emphasized
that it is able to act only as a
clearing-house for information
and cannot become involved in
negotiating leases or rental
agreements, nor in enforcing
the terms of contracts or handl-
ing disputes between landlords
and students.

IFC To Submit
Proposal

by John Billmyre

An Interfraternity Council pro-
posal dealing with party curtail-
ment will be considered today
by the Student Affairs Commit-
tee:

IFC representitives, many
fraternity presidents and
several Executive Committee
members, including President
Beau Dudley and President-
elect Steve Abraham, were pre-
sent at an IFC meeting Tuesday
to dsicuss the faculty proposal
regarding parties.

IFC president Syd Farrar
was met with strong opposition
after indicating that he intend-
ed to ask for a compromise on
the number of parties a frater-
nity would be aliowed to have
each semester.

‘We have compromised this
year and we have been screw-
ed,” said Kappa Alpha Member
Jeff Hamill.

“After a lengthy house
meeting, we don’t think we
should compromise,”’ said Dave
Meyers of Phi Kappa Psi.

But former IFC president Jim
Davis said that the IFC should
come up with something in
writing.

He divided the faculty pro-
posal into three parts, which he

said should be dealt with
seperately.
Hazing, Wednesday night

parties and the one o’clock cut-
off time were the three areas
which Davis addressed.

Bill Tucker, EC member and
KA, suggested an idea that Ab
Boxley of Phi Kappa Sigma also
supported, ‘‘We should give up
fraternity sponsored Wednes-
day night parties.”’

A final proposal to be given to
the faculty will not be com-
pleted until Friday, after the
SAC meeting.

The judicial board did not
meet, but will consider the
cases of several fraternities
that the SAC has charged with
holding a Sunday party, a viola-
tion of the IFC constitution.

Also to be discussed at Tues-
day’s meeting are the proposal
that the SAC will review and

 

final proposals for Rush
schedule changes.
IFC WEEKEND

 

This year’s Interfraternity
Council weekend Saturday will
feature three bands and 60 kegs
of beer. Twenty-five cent hot
dogs will be sold as the Skip
Castro Band, Memphis
Rockabillies, and the Shakers
toss out tunes from 1:00 p.m. til
midnight at Zollman’s
Pavillion.

Tickets to the event are
available free to fraternity
members through their frats,
and guests may purchase
tickets at fraternities at a cost
of $7.50 per couple or $5.50 stag.
The IFC says all students must
have tickets to get in.

by David Greer

Coeducation at Washington
and Lee was voted down by a
majority of students responding
to the Ring-tum Phi poll taken
last semester.

Of all the respondents, 57 per-
cent voted ‘no’ to the question
“Should W&L become coeduca-
tional?’’ 35 percent voted “‘yes”’
and seven percent had no opi-
nion,.

The poll, taken during the
class elections March 26, was
completed by about 30 percent

of the freshman, sophomore,
and junior classes.

In a poll taken last year, 56
percent of the students polled
favored coeducation, with the
senior class being the only class
to vote against coeducation.
The Board of Trustees voted
unanimously in 1976 to keep
W&L all-male.

Other Subjects Polled

Of the respondents, 74 percent
voted that the University should
build more on-campus housing.
Of them, 84 percent favored
apartments over dormitories.

Slightly more than half of the
students polled said they had
disputed a professor’s graded
evaluation of their work, and 75
percent felt there is a need for a
process of grade review at
W&L.

Of those who see a need for a
grade review, most felt it could
best be accomplished through
either the department head or a
committee of five professors. 83
percent of the respondents said
a professor’s grade should be
subject to being overturned.

Most students polled felt that
one of the two basketball courts

in the gym should be left open at
all times for general student
use.

Of the respondents to this
question, 78 percent supported
the open courts; nine percent
were against it and 13 percent
had no opinion.

EC Grant Supported

While 52 percent of those poll-
ed agreed with the EC’s deci-
sion to give the lacrosse team
$1,000 to help finance their
training trip to Florida, only 42
percent agreed that any varsity
sport should receive funding
from the EC.

On the question of EC
representation, 51 percent of
the respondents felt the
freshman class should have two
representatives (58 percent of
the freshmen felt this way.) On-
ly 30 percent felt the law school
should have three EC represen-
tatives, though.

Of the fraternity members, 76
percent felt that VMI cadets
should not be allowed into
fraternity parties without in-
vitation. Of the non-fraternity

This year’s senior banquet,
sponsored by the W&L Alumni
Association, is scheduled for
Tuesday, May 1. All seniors
should have received invita-
tions for the affair, which
begins with cocktails at 6 p.m.
in the Alumni House. A banquet
will follow at 7 p.m. in Evans
Dining Hall.

At this time, the annual Ring-
tum Phi Awards for outstanding
service to the university com-
munity will be presented, as
well as the Dean Gilliam
Award. The latter award goes
to the student ‘who had
rendered the greatest service to
the university.”’ The selection is
made by the undergraduate
members of the E.C.

Pinney, Murph Comment
On Fraternity Controversy

“I, for one, am not fully
satisfied with fraternities as
they presently operate,” said
Edward L. Pinney, Professor of
Politics, during a short inter-
view last week.

Dr. Pinney has been at W&L
for 16 years and is Chapter Ad-
visor for Sigma Nu.

“I feel the pending resolution

“Success of the motion will
depend mainly on the attitude of
the body enforcing it,’’ Pinney
concluded.

The location of certain frater-
nities and an increase in party-
ing have brought on problems
for fraternities, according to

school Proctor Charles F. Mur-

 

“ Hazing is nowhere near
as bad as it used to be.”

 

Charles F. Murray

in its approximate form will be
a modest step in the right direc-
tion,”’ said Pinney.

Pinney also called the resolu-
tion ‘‘conservative, because it
does not refer to a good many
things that would be hard to ac-
comodate.”’ He gave the omis-
sion of any pledging clause as
an example.

Students’ state of preparation
is the major problem’ it is not as
good on Thursday morning as
on other days,’’ claimed Pinney
Though he does not teach any
Thursday morning classes dur-
ing the fall or winter semesters,
he bases his opinion on ‘‘a lot of
comments from colleagues.’’

ray.

Murray, known to most
students as ‘“Murph’’, has been
Proctor for the past 21 years
and has been involved recently
with noise-level regulation for
mid-week parties.

He gave Phi Gamma Delta
and Sigma Phi Epsilon as ex-
amples of fraternities that par-
ty less often than most houses,
but have had much trouble with
police because of location.

Both fraternities are sur-
rounded by neighbors and close
to Lexington City Manager,
John V. Doane’s home.

“Some people are always go-
ing to complain, but if frater-

nities would quit some of this
midweek partying, things
would not be as bad on the
weekends,’’ said Murph.

But Murph also pointed out
that conditions, which have
grown worse over the past 10
years, have improved during
the past few months.

“The monthly inspection has
really improved the looks and
cleanliness of fraternities,’
Murph said.

“Windows are fixed a_lot
faster and grounds are cleaned
up more often,” Murph added.

He said the biggest area of
improvement has been with
hazing.

‘Hazing is nowhere near as
bad as it used to be,’”’ said. the
Proctor.

He recalled several. years
back when he saw _ people
“come into the gym beat to a
pulp,”’ from paddling and other
fraternity hazing activites.

However, recently, ‘‘I haven’t
seen any signs of abuse lately,
aside from some _hollering,”’
said Murph.

Murph said the fraternities
“serve an important role’’ at
the university in terms of hous-
ing.
“Take away the fraternities,
and where are these guys going
to live?” asked Murph.

Details of RTP Race Announced |

Plans for the third annual
Ring-tum Phi Road Race have
been finalized, announced race
director Jerry Darrell in an in-
terview this week.

The 15-kilometer (9.2 mile)
race is scheduled to begin at 9
a.m., Sunday, May 6, at W&L’s
Wilson Field. In addition, there
will be a 2-mile ‘“‘fun run’’ for
those who are less marathon-
inclined, but who wish to help
defeat multiple sclerosis. That

race will begin at 9:15 a.m.

Approximately 500,000
Americans suffer from MS and
related diseases, which affect
the brain and spinal cord.
Usually attacking people in the
prime years of 20 to 40, no
medication has yet been found
to be successful as a treatment
for MS.

The road race committee has
solicited businesses as patrons,

are encouraged to give a part of
their time and energy to this
worthy cause.

EC Clears IU Debts
In Monday Meeting

by David Greer

The student body Executive
Committee voted to take no ac-
tion concerning outstanding
debts owed by the now-defunct
Independent’s Union.

The IU owes the Ring-tum Phi
$39.60 for advertising expenses
incurred earlier this year, Phi
business manager Cove Geary
told the EC.

John Schmidt, who organized
the IU this year, said the group
does not have enough money in
its account to pay the bill.

The EC gave the IU $100 at
the beginning of the year.
Schmidt also collected five
dollars from each member of
the IU.

When he saw that the IU was
not going to work out, he said he
returned to each paying
member four dollars. He said
he had spent about $93 on
publicity and other expenses.

Schmidt bought the ads in

November and October, but did
not receive a bill until late
March. By then Schmidt had
already dispersed funds to the
figuring he would not be billed
for the advertising.

Semidt said his major com-
plaint lay in the fact that the Phi
was so late getting a bill to him.
“Look at the time period involv-
ed,” he said.

Senior EC representative Rob
Calvert said, ‘‘It’s an outstan-
ding bill you have to budget for.
It seems to be your responsibili-
ty.”

Sophmore representative Rob
Willis said, “It seems to me
we’re arguing something that’s
not in our area.’”’

The EC voted to allow
Schmidt to pay as much of the
bill as he could form the amount
remaining in the IU account. He
is also to submit a detailed ac-.
count of expenses to the EC.

The Washington and Lee Film
Society, with the generously

will present its seventh offering
in this year’s series on Friday

The Running Fence and

Buck Rogers:

 

Lost in Space

by Dick Barron
and Mark Kinniburgh

It wouldn’t be nice to come
out and say any movie was that
bad, but since we’re kollege
kids and can say anything we
want,Buck Rogers in the 25th
Century is at best insulting. It
lacks everything which made
all its predecessors entertain-
ing. Star Wars, with its
megabuck attendance figures,
was the pace-setter with its in-
telligent characters and clever,
not necessarily brilliant, story
line. The special effects of Star
Wars were adapted for televi-
sion and seen on ABC’s Bat-
tlestar Galactica, an ambitious
and often credible project
which was just recently cancell-
ed. Too bad they couldn’t have
caught Buck Rogers before it
hit the theaters.

Buck Rogers was originally
planned as a television special
before some Hollywood genius
decided to unleash it as a
feature film. It’s not certain,
but that poor clown must have
lost his job by now. Buck
Rogers was filmed with televi-
sion in mind: lots of close-ups
for the small screen; wild, sim-
ple colors; endlessly chattering
dialogue; and annoying, atten-
tion getting music. In a theater,
there are no _ distractions;
hence, no need for all of this
chaos, intended to lure T.V.
viewers back from the kitchen.

Curses! Beaten (Again)
By Those Damn Wahoos

by Doug Linton

The Generals did battle with
the University of Virginia
Cavaliers before a near capaci-
ty crowd of 6500 at Wilson Field
on Sunday, only to end up on the
short end of a 16-9 final score.

The fourth ranked Cavaliers
took an early 1-0 lead before Jay
Foster was able to tie it up five
minutes into the game. UVA hit
once more at 9:00, but Jeff Fritz
tallied only 13 seconds later to
make it 2-2 in an extra-man
situation. The Cavaliers took
advantage of a slashing penalty
and again took the lead. After
UVA got still another goal the
Generals were down 2-4 at the
end of the first period.

Virginia added one more at
the start of the second quarter
to increase the margin to three.
As the crowd became quiet, the
Generals exploded.

Rob Staugaitis had a
beautiful feed to John Hooper,
who put W&L within two, 3-5.
The offense perked up a bit
more and George Santos crank-
ed a hard shot from out front to
cut the Cavalier lead to only
one. At 7:15, less than a minute
later, John Black scored
unassisted on a fast break to tie
the game at 5-5. The Generals
clearly were in control and UVA
was forced to call a timeout to
slow down the tempo.

The break was effective, as
Virginia came right back to
score in less than 30 seconds,
taking a 6-5 lead. Mike Pressler
then came on for the Generals
and the first time he touched the
ball all day he fired a near im-
possible ‘no angle’’ shot to
make it 6-6. UVA was able to get
one more by halftime and the
Cavaliers went into the locker-
room with a 7-6 lead. It looked
as if an upset by the eighth
ranked Generals was still a
good possibility.

The Cavaliers apparently felt
the reality of this threat and
responded respectably. They
came onto the field in the third
quarter and outscored the
Generals 5-1, muffling any
chance of being embarrassed
by a non-scholarship squad.
W&L’s only goal of the period
came off the stick off Santos,
cranking his second of the
game.

Virginia was unrelenting in
the fourth quarter also, outscor-

ing the Generals again, 4-2. It
seemed that the Generals just
couldn’t get more than one or
two shots in a row. The two
W&L tallies came in extra-man
situations — both Black to John
Kemp combinations. When the
buzzer sounded, W&L was still
seven goals short of the
Cavaliers total of 16.

‘“‘We’re not a team to make
excuses,” said Coach Emmer.
“They are a good solid team
with some very fine athletes,
and we got beat. I’m very happy
with the effort the guys put out;
we hung tough.”’

Goalie Bob Clements had
another fine day, despite the
score, with 24 saves. This brings
his season total to 169. It is in-
teresting to note that the
Virginia keeper only had 7
saves, so even if all of those
shots on goal were successful, it
would only have been 16-16. The
offense just wasn’t quite there.
The defense should be credited
for keeping the game as close as
it was!

Since the Generals’ number
eight ranking came out before
the Virginia contest was over, a
playoff berth is still. ques-
tionable. W&L will now go on to
face Washington College,
Roanoke, and wind up the
regular season at home against
Hofstra. Emmer stated that
“we'll just have to take them
one at a time, and let the chips
fall where they may.”

cess over the Spring break as
they traveled to New Jersey

and upset the Scarlet Knights of
Rutgers in an 11-10 thriller. At
game time Rutgers was ranked
eighth, with W&L three behind
them in the number eleven slot.
It was a critical game in respect
to postseason playoff hopes for
each team.

Rutgers got the early lead
with less than three minutes
gone, but Jeff Fritz tied the con-
test just 23 seconds later. Jay
Foster scored next for W&L,
giving the Generals a_ lead
which they were not to sur-
render. After Rob Staugaitis
threaded a pass to John Kemp,
who took advantage of the situa-
tion, W&L led 3-1 at the end of
the first quarter.

Generals 11
Rutgers 10

The Scarlet Knights got
another quick tally to open the
high-scoring second period, on-
ly again to be answered by
Fritz. Rutgers then netted one
more, but another Staugaitis to
Kemp combination made it 5-3
Generals with half of the period
left.

Rutgers then squeezed in
another one before Fritz found
the goal once more. Following
this, defender Steve Johnson
charged downfield to dump the
ball off to Foster, who got his se-
cond strike. Before the dust set-
tled Sandy Mc Donald found the
back of the net off a Geoff Brent
assist, Rutgers capitalized
twice more, and the Generals
led 8-6 at the half.

Both teams seemingly ex-
hausted their offenses in the 14-
goal first half, as the crowd wat-
ched a defensive exhibition for
the rest of the day. Each squad
found the net only once in the
third quarter, with Scott
McLam hitting for the
Generals.

The Scarlet Knights hit first

 

 

in the final period to close the ~

gap to 9-8, before Fritz scored
his fourth unassisted goal of the
day. Rutgers bounced back only
seconds later to make it 10-9
with only 3:32 left in the game.

At 2:45 Brent threw his se-
cond assist to John Black, who
fired what proved to be the win-
ning goal past the Rutgers’
keeper. The Scarlet Knights fell
just short as they got one more
before the final shistle, leaving
the Generals with the 11-10 vic-
tory. ' ’

Netmen Tumble
On Texas Trip

by Nat Lovell

During Spring break, the
W&L netmen ventured to Texas
for what was surely the
toughest part of the schedule.
The Generals were 9-0 losers in
all the matches against the
Division I schools.

On April 18, the University of
Dallas became the first to
defeat the netmen on the trip.
Stewart Jackson was beaten by
Jim Vanier 6-1, 6-3. Shaw Cran-
field was defeated by Bob Vaan-
drager 6-4, 6-1. At number
three, Doug Gaker was edged
by Joe Suri 6-4, 6-4. Pat Norris
lost a three-set match to Mike
Avner 4-6, 6-1, 6-2. Dave Con-
stine fell to Fred Redelijk 7-6,
6-4. Wes Yonge was blitzed by
Barry Janse 6-1, 6-1. The Dallas
players finished off the victory
by taking all doubles in two
sets.

The team fared no better the
following day at the hands of
Texas Christian University.

Track Team Aims For
ODAC Title This Week

by Greg Branan

“Coming off exams and
break, we ran extremely well,”’
were the words of track coach
Norris Aldridge relating to the
Generals’ triple wins over Lyn-
chburg, Eastern Mennonite,
and Roanoke College in last Fri-
day’s meet at Lynchburg.

Final score for the meet was
W&L-70, Lynchburg College-61,
EMC-35, and Roanoke-19.

“Our depth pulled us through
with seconds, thirds, and four-
ths,’ Coach Aldridge added.
Many firsts were also tallied.

The 440 yard relay team of
Jeff Brown, Chris Leiser,

Stewart Atkinson, and Norvell
Scott placed first, Rich Bird
took third in the 1500 meters,
Jim Vines took fourth in the 110
high hurdles while in the 400
meters Billy Morris took first,
Dave Cordell third and Jim
Parker fourth. In the 100 meters
Stewart Atkinson was second,
Jeff Brown third and Chris
Leiser fourth, and Rich Bird
came back to place second in
the 800 meters. Russ Rector
was second and Jim Vines third
in the 400 meter hurdles, and in
the 200 meters Atkinson was se-
cond and Brown fourth. The
mile relay team of Billy Morris,
Dave Cordell, Jim Parker and

Atkinson placed third.

In the field events Randy
Austin was first and Scott
Swope third in the javelin; in
the shot-put Phil Dunlay was
first, Buz Manning third and
Larry Davis fourth. In the
discus Manning took first,
Dunlay second and Chip Nunley
third while Russ Rector was
first and Paul Hendrey second
in the high jump.

The 6-1 Generals travel back
to Lynchburg College this
Saturday for the ODAC Cham-
pionships. ‘“‘With Jack Norberg
coming back we stand a really
good chance of winning,”
remarked Coach Aldridge.

games in six days. This took its
toll on the pitching staff and the
hitting. The team began the
week with a 16-9 loss to
Bridgewater, an ODAC oppo-
nent. On Wednesday, April 18,
the Generals split a
doubleheader with West
Virginia Tech at home losing
the first 8-2 and taking the
nightcap 14-8. In the win the
Generals came up with ten runs
in the third inning off of key hits
by Dan Kingman and Rich
Wiles. Doug Hassinger also had
three RBI’s in the game, with a
home run and a single.

The bats cooled off, however,
as the Generals then dropped
single games to Lynchburg 13-0
and Eastern Mennonite 15-5.
The team also dropped a
doubleheader to Newport News
on Sunday by scores of 6-4, and
5-2.

The Generals have games re-
maining with Lynchburg,
Emory & Henry, and VMI, and
may participate in this
weekend’s ODAC Tournament
if they finish fourth or better in
the ODAC race.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Faculty Misperceptions

The recent faculty proposal to restrict fraternities’ social ac-
tivities was met with overall objection and great concern among
the student body. The proposal also caused concern among the
faculty. We are told that six professors approached Dr. Pinney, ob-
jecting to parts of the proposal — they felt it was too lenient. The
problems that led up to the proposal and the student reaction is
largely a result of misperceptions on both sides of the fence.

The faculty (and others in the community) object to much of
what they see in student body actions and attitudes. The faculty is
concerned about the anti-academic attitudes and the decadent
behavior of some of the student body, and they should be concern-
ed. The faculty’s mistake, though, is blaming fraternities for all of
these ills. Cursing at sporting events and general “‘rowdiness”’ are
not necessarily fraternity functions. And Wednesday night parties
are not the root of all evil.

It seems the faculty thinks that by prohibiting Wednesday night
parties the school will enter an intellectual renaissance. What the
faculty fails to see is that in the past two years, before mid-week
parties were restricted to Wednesday nights, there were parties on
several nights of the week. They lasted much longer and were a lot
wilder. And midweek parties in Lexington have helped to lower the
number of organized road trips, which are often more time con-
suming and hence more likely to cause missed classes.

! The faculty also fails to give credit to efforts fraternities and the
IFC made to improve some of the faults. Fraternity inspections
have gone smoothly and the alumni inspection committee was
pleased with the improvements. The IFC took definite measures
when the noise ordinance issue arose, restricting parties (both by
night and hour) and enforcing restrictions with stiff fines for
violators. The IFC went through proper channels to try to reach an
agreement with the town and when this failed, restrictions stayed
intact.

Meanwhile, many students see the faculty’s action as an attempt
to close down the fraternities. This is not the case, however. Some

- may call the proposal misdirected, but the faculty feel that

‘desperate times call for desperate measures,’’ in their effort to
halt this downward trend of behavior. In any event, this proposal is
a piece of rope with which the students can either pull themselves
up or hang themselves. The faculty has the power to govern stu-
dent life and they will use it. If the students react in irresponsible
ways, the faculty will try more extreme measures. But if the
students take it in stride, just as they did the noise hassle, the facul-
ty may see that the students are indeed more responsible than
credited.

The chances are very high that mid-week parties will be pro-
hibited. Students will say, ‘‘It won’t do any good; we’ll just go down
the road.”” But many of the faculty see nothing wrong with this
They object to all members of a fraternity being under social and
economic pressure to attend fraternity sponsored mid-week par-
ties. We hope that the faculty will allow a few parties during Rush
and the beginning of the semesters; after all, the University spon-
sored one of the largest mid-week parties the school has seen after
the Library Move.

A final note: personal harrassment of Dr. Pinney and other
members of the faculty does not help the students’ cause but only
reinforces the perception — or misperception— the faculty may

have of the students.

Letters To The Editor

Student Attacks Lacrosse Fan Conduct

Dear Editor:

W&L students do not deserve their lacrosse
team. After beating eighth ranked Rutgers at
Princeton, the team faced U.Va. last Sunday
in the Generals’ sports event of the year. The
team was in peak form, primed to deal with

the Wahoos, hoping to exploit the home field —

advantage.

The lack of support demonstrated by our
students was disgraceful. Rarely during the
match did the crowd noise rise above a con-
versational level. Instead of wild cheering to
urge our team on, our students contented

themselves with purposeless drinking and
parading new khakis and alligator shirts.
Their superficial posturing, though much in
character, all but eliminated any edge the
team had by playing at Wilson Field. The
final blow came with the fan exodus early in
the final quarter. Nothing like fan apprecia-
tion. Jack Emmer and the players are entit)-
ed to better. How sad it is that they can expect
no more from this community.
Sincerely,
Richard P. Goddard

Barritt Named Department Head

Dr. C. Westbrook Barritt, who
has taught Spanish at
Washington and Lee University
for 27 years, has been named
head of W&L’s romance
languages department effective
July 1. He will serve a five-year
term in that position.

Dr. Barritt succeeds Dr. G.
Francis Drake as department
head. Dr. Drake has reached 65,
the mandatory retirement age
for department heads. He will
continue teaching French.

The romance languages
department incorporates
French, Spanish and Italian
languages and literature.

The new department head is a
1943 graduate of Washington
and Lee. He received his
graduate degrees from the
University of Virginia. In addi-
tion to general Spanish
language and literature, his
fields of teaching specialty in-
clude medieval and
Renaissance poetry, fiction and
drama.

Dr. Drake, the retiring
department head, has taught at

levening will be the great
Memories of Under-
development (1958), directed by
the Cuban Filmmaker Tomas
Gutierrez Alea, which also ex-
plored the relationship between
documentary material and art.
Its fictionalized account of a
small property owner who
decides to remain in Cuba after
the Revolution, while the rest of
his family, including his wife,
flee to the United States, in-
cludes documentary sequences.
The film focuses movingly on
his memories, his political and
emotional readjustment, and
his unexpectedly vigorous sex-
ual life.

This is a post-Castro political
film, but it is utterly devoid of
polemics. It infuses a documen-
tary llok with as complex and
skeptical a sensibility as that
which informs the finest Euro-
pean films. It has the capacity
to overthrow our assumptions
that we know what Latin
American art and life are like.

The Film Society’s last movie
of the season will be the recent

nounced that Dave Constine,
junior class Vice President, will
replace junior representative
Dee Keesler for the Spring
Term while Keesler is not here.

Voting on White Book

changes that include explaining
the options a student has when
witnessing an honor violation.
Under the new wording, he can
either confront the suspect or
inform an EC member of a

possible violation.
The EC also voted to adopt
rules on accépting new

evidence. Now the suspect will
be allowed to decide whether
new evidence can be admitted
and gives him time to prepare
for it. The EC voted to rule that
anything a suspect says to an
EC member can be_ used
against him.

The EC adopted a policy that
a majority decision is needed

Buck Rogers

(continued from page 3)
All of this is calculated to draw
attention from the fact that
there is no coherent story line.
Supposedly, our hero Buck
has been floating through
space, in suspended animation,
for 500 years. When at last he is

liberated from his frigid condi- .

tion, he finds himself involved
in the murky intrigue of the
earth of the future. Buck is con-
fused, to say the least, and the
audience is baffled. The Evil
Princess is bent on taking over
the world (we got that much
straight) and the world forces
don’t like that, as they’re trying

to get friendly with the
princess. The plot starts off
nicely, but it falls apart, and
results in a sloppy blur.

It’s hard to be serious about
the acting in this film. After all,
Bob Denver could have done
more with the lead role than Gil
Gerard. Even the cast of the
doomed Battlestar Galac-
tica had talent, which puts
them way above the cast of
Buck Rogers. There is only one

solution — this film should be

shipped back to television,
preferably Saturday mornings,
where it belongs.

Seniors In Jeopardy

by Stuart Snyder

More seniors are in grade
trouble this year than before.

During the winter term there
were 288 seniors who wanted to
receive a degree, but now that
number is lowered to. 278
because of failure to meet
graduation requirements.

According to Harold S. Head,
registrar, normally about five
students cannot possibly meet
graduation requirements after
the winter term.

He added that the majority of
the ten eliminated were
commerce-school students. He
explained that no matter how
hard they work they could not
graduate in June.

He stated that there are the
usual numbers of June
graduating seniors, approx-

the

imately a dozen, that must com-
plete spring term courses in

order to graduate.
According to Head, some
seniors must pass certain

courses with A’s in order to
graduate, while others must
take up to nine credits this spr-
ing to fulfill their requirements.

According to Head, students
are required to file a degree ap-
plication by November 1 of their
senior year. ‘“‘We do this so that
we can council the students and
advise them of where they
stand in achieving their
degree,”’ said Head.

“You won't find this system
at larger universities. Usually
they don’t let you know until it is
time to receive your degree,”
he added.

Head stated that there are
many choices that a senior
could make if he were deficient
in credits. He also feels that
most deficiency problems
would have been cleared up if
the students had checked their
standings regularly. ‘‘All a stu-
dent has to do is come in and we
will sit down and discuss how he
is doing,’’ he added.

Gilliam, Newspaper

Awards Presented

Waller T. Dudley, president
of the student body, was
presented the Frank J. Gilliam
award for recognized service to
Washington and Lee and the
student body by William Watt,
Dean of the College, at Tuesday
night’s senior banquet.

The award, given annually

years.

The recipient of the award is

given $100 and is allowed to
designate $150 to go to a campus
organization. The money is pro-
vided by the Student Body
Fund. The recipient is selected
by the undergraduate members
of the Executive Committee,
who choose him from nomina-
tions submitted by the student
body.
Dudley, a third year law stu-
dent from Alexandria, Virginia,
has held many honors druing
his undergraduate and law
years at W&L.

As an undergraduate, Dudley
was secreatry of the 1972 Mock
Convention, a member of the
Dance Board for three years,
and president for two years of
Phi Kappa Sigma social frater-
nity.

IFC Drafts Proposal

in Marathon Session

by John Billmyre

The Interfraternity Council
adopted a proposal in response
to the faculty proposal limiting
parties, and passed a by-law
preventing freshmen from
pledging before the fourth rush
date, during a two-hour meeting

Tuesday night.

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee will review the proposal to-
day and the faculty will act
upon it Monday. The pledging
change will be enacted next fall.

Both decisions were reached
only after long discussion, IFC
President Syd Farrar had to
call the meeting to order on
several occassions.

Much debate centered around
the definition of ‘‘House Par-
ties’’ and the efficacy of the pro-
posal in limiting parties.

The proposal defines house
parties as ‘‘any function funded
by treasury or billed to the
members on a deferred basis.”’
Included are funded functions
on and off the campus.

The proposal, however, does
not prohibit individuals from
gathering and holding a social
event.

“This proposal will allow all
the individuals to have all the
parties they want as long as

they chip in,’’ according to Syd

Farrar.

David E. Constine III, of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, argued
that the proposal was only an
attempt to postpone the in-
evitable.

“We are just buying time, the
faculty will compromise and
compromise until they get
disgusted with weeknight par-
ties; they can end them,”
argued Constine.

But Syd Farrar argued, “If
we change and the problem re-
mains, then the faculty cannot
nail the fraternities.”’

Mac Kennedy of Beta Theta
Pi saw problems with enforce-
ment of the proposal, should it
be adopted.

“It just contains too many
loopholes,’’ Kennedy said dur-
ing one of the more heated
moments of discussion.

Seldon Clarke of Beta also
talked about loopholes,
“Everyone is going to con-
tribute money, and there will
not be a difference in partying.”

Farrar disagreed because the
proposal ‘‘will place the burden
of the decision on the in--
dividual.’’ He added ‘‘because a
someone has not already paid
for the party, he won’t feel
tempted to go if he has to
study.”

When the vote was finally
taken, 14 representatives voted
in favor of the proposal, two

Dobbs Speech Highlights Senior Banquet

by David Greer

The senior banquet honoring
the class of 1979 was held in
Evans Dining Hall Tuesday
night.

The banquet, revived last
year by the Alumni Association,
honored both the
undergraduate and law school
seniors.

At the banquet the Frank J.
Gilliam award was given to
Beau Dudley, Student Body
President, in recognition of his
service to Washington and Lee
and the student body. The
Ring-tum Phi awards were also
given.

“As you go forth in the
world,’’ said Dobbs, ‘“‘you have
an opportunity to change the at-
titiudes that others have about
ourUniversity.”

Dobbs spoke of
characteristics of W&L that set
it apart from most schools. He
told of how Dr. William Hinton,
who lay dying in Lexington last
January, spoke to Dobbs and
made reference to his ex-
periences with him during
Dobbs’ undergraduate years
here. ‘‘Any organization that
can engender this brand of
loyalty and devotion in the wan-
ing moments of a man’s life has

“They accuse our graduates of being

elitist and thus suspect.”

 

Dr. Gary H. Dobbs, assistant
professor of biology at W&L, ad-
dressed the group, telling the
seniors, ‘‘When you leave this
University, it is my sincere
hope that the mark this univer-
sity made on you was a good
one.”’

Dobbs, who was a student
here from 1966 to 1970, related
experiences he had after
graduating and how his days at

clean, and something warm
about it,’’ said Dobbs.

“You are The hope for the
future; the reaffirmation of the
goals and aspirations of this
University,’ Dobbs told the
seniors.

Speaking of the responsibilty
each alumni has for preserving
and spreading the school’s
reputation, Dobbs said, ‘Each

and something warm about it.”’

-Dr. Gary H. Dobbs on W&L

 

W&L prepared him for those ex-
periences.

Speaking on his graduate
work at the Scripps Institution
of Oceanography at the Univer-
sity of California, San Diego,
Dobbs said he found his training
at W&L in such areas as honor
helped him and was noticed by
colleagues and_ professors.
However, Dobbs said he also
found that not all women are
suceptible to ‘‘that Southern
charm honed to a fine edge in
the Shenandoah Valley.’’ Dobbs
said that the training one
receives at W&L is different
from many people’s training
and that a graduate should be
proud of that difference and
used it to the advantage of
himself and others.

EC Receives University
Council Petitions

By David Greer

The Student Body Executive
Committee recieved petitions
for Monday’s University Coun-
cil elections.

Eight freshmen, no
sophomores, and two juniors
submitted petitions. There are
two positions for the sophomore
and junior classes and three for
the senior class.

Submitting petitions for the
sophomore representatives
were Bill Alfano, Scott Burr,
Jed Dunn, Ben Jarrett, Bryan
Kocen, Kelly Moles, Stephen T.
Nardo, and Andrew Trotter.

Jeff Bartlett and Marc Ot-
tinger submitted petitions for
the senior positions.

The EC voted that there be a
$7.50 spending limit for the can-
didates and that each may only
put up one banner and 15
posters. Rising sophmores are
restricted to advertising in the
dorms and Evans Dining Hall.

The elections will be held
Monday. Polls will be set up in
front of Newcomb Hall and in
the quad.

In other business, Jay
Blumberg and Burr Datz re-
quested $250 for T-shirts for
participants in the Ring-tum
Phi Road Race, a fund-rasing
project for MS.

Student Body President Beau
Dudley said, “We don’t do
things for charity very much.

It’s high time we did.” With
that, the EC voted to give the
project $200 for the T-shirts.

Grant Leister, business
manager of the Calyx, announc-
ed that the yearbooks are due to
be shipped between May 20 and
May 23. He said that there was a
very real possibility that the
Calyx could make a profit this
year.

Dudley announced that John
Fraser was elected senior law

representative for next year.

The University Theater sub-
mitted a petitions requesting
EC money to rent a dance mat
for $200 a month. Dudley ques-
tioned spending $200 for a
month and having no return,
and sophomore representative
Willie Mackie pointed out that
the petition was from a class
and not a campus organization.
Voting was tabled as there was
no representaive present from
the theater.

Lowry Presents
Economics Articles

Two articles on economics by
Dr. S. Todd Lowry, professor of
economics and aministration at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, are included in two major
economics journals,

Dr. Lowry’s article, ‘‘Recent
Literature on Ancient Greek
Economic Thought,” appears in
the Journal of Economic
Literature, a 27,000-circulation
publication of the American
Economic Association.

His article is a survey and
analysis of the post-World War
II literature, reappraising the
significance of ancient con-
tributions to economic theory,

Dr. Lowry said.

The second article, ‘“‘A
Nightmare in Introductory
Economics,” appears in the
Journal of Economics Issues,
published by Michigan State
University’s economics depart-
ment and research division.
The article is a humorous
dialogue on a technical aspect
of price theory.

Dr. Lowry, who holds a law
degree as well as the Ph.D. in
economics, was educated at the
University of Texas and Loui-
siana State University. He join-
ed the Washington and Lee
faculty in 1959.

Honor Code Supported
In Ring-tum Phi Poll

by David Greer

Most students at Washington
and Lee feel that the Honor code
is effective, a recent poll taken
the Ring-tum Phi shows.

According to the poll, 80 per-
cent of the students in the
freshman, sophomore, and
junior class who responded to
‘he poll agreed that the honor
rode is effective at W&L.

Eleven percent disagreed
with the effectiveness of the
ronor code and eight percent
1ad no opinion.

At the same time, though, 66
ryercent of the respondents said
hat they would like to see the
1onor code more effective.

When asked, ‘‘According to
she White Book, does the honor

pus?’’ 68 percent of the students
polled answered ‘‘yes.” Eigh-
teen percent had no opinion.

The White Book specifies that
the honor code applies
throughout Rockbridge County
and wherever a_ student
represents himself as a
Washington and Lee student.

When the responses were
broken down by class, the
knowlege of this point in the
White Book decreased with age,
that is, more freshmen than
juniors answered correctly.

The students polled felt that a
student should be responsible to
the Honor Code when intox-
icated (on drugs or alchohol).
Eighty-four percent agreed on
this while eight percent

disagreed.

At The Door:

Of the respondents, 40 percent
said they had known of an honor
code violation that was never
reported. The junior class,
which had the strongest sup-
portive responses about the
code’s effectiveness and pursuit
of violators who commited their
crimes while under the _ in-
fluence, had the highest rate of
knowlege of honor violations.
The Executive Committee
recently voted down a proposal
that would make not turning in
a violation a violation in itself.

Most students polled wnat to
keep honor trials closed to the
public. Seventy-five percent of
the respondents answered ‘‘no”’
te the question, “Should all
honor trials be open and
public?”

The present system opens to
the public only appealed trials,
and there has not been an open
honor trial here for many years.
The EC recently stressed that
confidentiality of honor pro-
ceedings protects the accused

The Deer Hunter: Racism or Reality?

by Dick Barron

By now, The Deer Hunter has
become a common conversa-
tion topic everywhere. It’s a
wonder anybody goes to see it,
since someone invariably men-
tions the extreme gore or ex-
cessive length of some scenes.
But it did win an Oscar for best
picture, and there is some
credibility in that award. Still,
there are several important
criticisms of the film which
need to be answered.

Jane Fonda (not having seen
the film) joined others in a
strong blast of the film’s
“racist’’ content saying, in ef-
fect,The Deer Hunter depicted
the Vietnamese as_ sadistic
gooks with no more respect for
life than the lowest animals.

Maybe there is some validity in
the critics’ charge — The Deer
Hunterpresented the Viet-
namese in stereotyped roles.
Those who oppose the entire
film, however, miss the point
entirely. Yes, the Vietnamese
are depicted in a biased, over-
simplified way, but The Deer
Hunter was not ever intended
to be a sociological profile. If
anything close to that, the film
was more concerned with the
sociology of those Pennsylvania
steel workers which occupy the
majority of the film, that is, if
the producers ever intended
this to be a sociological profile
in the first place.

Like many other works of fic-
tion, The Deer Hunter uses
significant events — times of

chaotic social social change
combined with strong family
traditions As backdrops for the
action of the main characters.
These stereotypes provide in-
teresting and easily identifiable
circumstances againt which we
can observe full character
development. To malign The
Deer Hunter for using
stereotypes or ‘‘racism’’ would
be to dismiss many great films
or works of fiction for being too
simplistic in their depiction of
reality.

The director and all the ac-
tors involved with The Deer
Hunter have created a film tru-
ly deserving of ‘best picture’
status. The lengthy wedding
scene, prior to the Vietnam se-
quences, is justifiable. The in-

Entertainment
Musical Mainstream

by Mark Mainwaring
Robin Meredith

This column’s last review of
the country’s top singles was
overwhelmingly positive—so
much so, in fact, that we decid-
ed to try it again. Back by
popular demand (?), Musical
Mainstream’s thoughts on the
current top ten (minus
“Tragedy and ‘I Will Sur-
vive’, which were reviewed
last time).

“Music Box Dancer’’—Frank
Mills—This one was pleasant

enough on first listen. Un-
fortunately, it was barely
tolerable the second time

around, and I found myself
scrambling for the OFF button
the third time I heard it. Cute
instrumentals seem to make it
big every couple of years
(witness ‘‘Nadia’s Theme”
back in ‘76), soaring to the top
of the charts and usually fading

  

even faster. ‘‘Music Box
Dancer”’ is no exception, save
perhaps that it gets old faster
than most. More irritating than
fingernails on a blackboard.

“Knock on Wood’’—Ami
Stewart—You can’t help but
notice the rhythmie and
melodic similarities to the Bee
Gees’ “Tragedy” (not to men-
tion the production), and
“Knock on Wood’ suffers
somewhat by comparison. Ami
Stewart’s rather weak vocals
are almost overcome by _ in-
teresting production and fine in-
strumentation...but not quite.
Without the phrasing and emo-
tion that, say, Donna Summer
could have put into the song,
“Knock On Wood” ultimately
misses the mark. :

“Stumbling’ In’’—Suzi
Quatro and Chris Norman—
This can’t be the real Suzi

 

 

 

 

 

Rockbridge Viewed, a show at duPont Gallery features local sub-

jects,

Quatro. The hard-rocking
leather queen? Sang ‘Your
Mama Won't Like Me’’? I figure
RSO just hid the real Suzi away
long enough to create a low-
powered clone (ditto Eric Clap-
ton). Boring melody, lousy
vocals (Chris Norman seems
unable to carry a tune)—the
song’s just there. Bet your
mama’s gonna love her now,
though.

“Heart of Glass’’—Blondie—
Deborah Harry’s sexy, etherea!
vocals are easily the high point
of this gem. “Heart of Glass”
doesn’t bow] you over on first
listen, but it definitely grows on
you. A surprise AM success,
especially given the ‘‘dirty”
lyrics (apparently Chrysalis
has prepared a version without
the phrase ‘‘pain inthe ass’’).

‘| Want Your Love’’—Chic—
About all that can be said about
this one is that it’s not quite as
bad as ‘Le Freak’’. However,
what it lacks in lyrical banality
it very nearly makes up for with
one of the deadest ar-
rangements to hit the dance
floor in years. Disco songs
aren't supposed to look good on
paper; the responsibility for
dressing them up and giving
them a little life lies with the
producers and arrangers. a
task at which Bernard Edwards
and Nile Rodgers of Chie have
dismally failed. ‘Il Want Your
Love’ is probably one of the
biggest plodders of the year.

“Sultans of Swing’’—Dire
Straits—This is really kind of a
hard one to figure out. Aside
from the obvious fact that it has
absolutely nothing to recom-
mend it as a hit single, my feel-
ings totheir unnecessarily in-
tellectual lyrics and Mark
Knopfler’s Dylanesque vocals
clash from day one, to the point
of being just plain annoying. On
the other hand, Knopfler’s
guitar work is just ds
mesmeriziug as everyone's
been saying. In fact, it could
well be that some of his lines
(continued on page 11)

teraction here between the
characters is amazingly
natural, strikingly low-key, and
this makes the early parts of the
film important and enjoyable.
There is something happening
with these mediocre people that
makes us forget we’re watching
a movie.

We can’t forget the
cinematography which sets The
Deer Hunter far above its com-
petitors. Such depth and clarity
is rarely seen in films today.

The Deer Hunter is a bloody
film, and this makes it difficult
to watch. There are racial

stereotypes and simple presen-
tations of history which, for a
documentary, would be un-
forgivable. But The Deer
Hunter is not a documentary; it
is a film of great visual beauty,
presenting strong acting and a
potent story which are combin-
ed to give us one of the great
films of the seventies. It’s not
about Vietnam,. but about: peo-
ple caught in the Vietnam era
with all of its crazy fragmenta-
tion and misdirected energies.
Let’s not condemn The Deer
Hunteron the basis of so-

meone’s over-simplification.

 

The SAB’s Spring Concert will feature Firefall.

 

Total

Total Theater is known as a
spring term tradition at
Washington and Lee. But even
tradition can change, and the 42
students in the Drama Depart-
ment course are taking part ina
new format for this traditional
activity.

Rather than offering one or
two major productions as in the
past, the class will develop
several ‘‘mini-productions’’ as
well as a full seript comedy pro-
duced by senior drama major
Phil Heldrich.

The mini-productions will in-
clude performances in film and
animation, ballet, improvisa-
tion, stage combat and voice,
which are studied in ‘‘mini-
courses’ during the first two
weeks of the course. During the
third and fourth weeks of the
term mini-courses in makeup,
lights and sound, clowning, and
silk screening will be added to
the ballet course. Students
choose the area they wish to
study during the two periods,
but drama professor Lee Kahn
says students gain exposure to
all the areas offered.

Kahn also said that the Total
Theater setup allows students
to work closely with one another
in small groups and as a class.

 

Total Theater is

 

   
   
   
  
    
   
  
  
 
 
   
      
     
   
 
 
  

Effort

He said the situation develops a
‘company attitude, the best
attitude to have in a university
theater.’’

In response to remarks that
total theater is an easy way to
spend the spring, Kahn replies
that ‘there are general
misconceptions about the
course.’’ Although he flatly
states the course is not designed
to be difficult, he is quick to
demonstrate the amount of time
involved in the six credit
course. The class schedule
demands at least seven hours
each day Monday through Fri-
day and projects usually call for
additional time on weekends.
Do students have to put in this
much time? Kahn says ‘‘people
either work or they don’t and
they get the appropriate
grade.”’

If you want to see the results
of the group’s work, students
will perform ‘‘show and tells’’
of their specialties tomorrow
morning from 9:50 til 12:30
which are open to the public.
Later this month final produc-
tions will be staged, including
one-man shows and a series of
one-act plays written by
Washington and Lee student
James Leva.

 
     
 
  

 
Adcock Group Performs in
Cockpit Tonight

At 8:00 p.m. tonight, the
Cockpit and the UCC are proud
to announce that the highly
entertaining and energetic Ed-
die and Martha Adcock and II
Generation are returning to the
W&L campus for their last ap-
pearance of this school year,
and if you haven’t seen them
yet, you,ve really missed a lot!

The Second Generation was
formed in 1971 by Eddie, former
banjo player for the original
Country Gentlemen, along with
Martha Hearon (they were
married three years ago),
Johnny Castle, and Jeff Wisor.
For a few years, they toured in
California by themselves, as
well as renting their tremen-
dous sound system out to other
professional bands. This double
life became very tiresome and
eventually led to the break-up of
the band, somewhere near 1974.

Eddie and Martha continued to
play with one another (pun in-
tended) and concentrated on
albums instead of touring, and
their first albums demonstrated
their excellent blending of
voices and poignant  song-
writing abilities.

It was at this time that Eddie
devised an amplification
system for the banjo, an instru-
ment that posed problems as
far as accurate sound reproduc-
tion. He also began to fool
around a little bit on the electric
guitar, as he tells it, and the
music of II Generation opened
up. Big Johnny returned to play
electric bass, and the band
began to tour again. Eddie now
plays banjo and Telecaster
about equally divided during
the show.

bluegrass performers. His
singing and style of banjo play-
ing have for years placed him at
the top of the list as far as pure
talent is concerned. Starting
with Mac Wiseman when he
was fourteen, even playing live
at WREL a few years in a row,
then founding the Country
Gentlemen in 1959, he establish-
ed himself as a_ professional
with a set idea of where his
music should go. Today, he is
satisfied with where it has gone
and where he is going. His
guitar playing is simply
phenomenal Picking with three
fingers of his right hand, mov-
ing everywhere on the neck
with his left, the notes flow from
the amplifier confidently,
whether he’s playing hard rock,
the blues or country riffs.

And finally’ by no means is
this band a strictly bluegrass
band! Rock and roll is a very
big part of their act, and if you
are an R & R fan’ stop by the
Cockpit tonight for their per-
formance.

Nighthawks

Return To

Lexington

Tickets for the Nighthawks
shows on May 15 are still on sale
at Evans Dining Hall from Burr
Datz. For students, prices are
as follows: $3.00 in advance,
$4.00 at the door and $5.00 in ad-
vance for both shows. For non
W&L students, prices are $4.00
in advance, $5.00 at the door.

The last time the Nighthawks
were in Lexington, they sold out
the second show. Their albums
have been well received
wherever they have been
played, and they have played
with all the great bluesmen of
the day. Their stage presence is
among the best in the business,
and they area group that should
not be missed, no matter what
the reason. They enjoyed play-
ing the Cockpit the last time
they were here, and called us up
to see if they could play here
again, so if you are a fan of
rockin’ blues, come out and lend
your support to the best white
blues band in the country. Only
250 tickets will be sold to both
shows, so get yours early.

Cye And Ear:
From he Bookstore

It is early spring of 1984. At
their recent meeting in
Alcapulco the Trustees of
Washington and Lee, after a
lengthy study of the coeduca-
tion question, have voted that
the University will ‘reaffirm
the unique character of
Washington and Lee’s
undergraduate divisions’’ and
will remain an all-male school.
The results of theRing Tum
Phi’s 37th poll of the student
body show that 30% of the
freshman, sophomore and
junior classes are opposed to co-
education by a margin of 51% to
49%. One student is quoted as
saying he wants to be able to
work without the distraction of
women’s presence, as he ex-
pects to do after he graduates.
He is hopeful of securing a posi-
tion in a_ newly-formed
monastery in Antartica.

On April 18, 1984 the Presi-
dent of the United States, invok-
ing the discretionary powers
granted him by the Congress,
orders stringent gas rationing.
The social, emotional and
physical impact of this direc-
tive is immediately and
dramatically apparent on the
Washington and Lee campus.
Within two days there are no
more bicycles for purchase
within a radius of 20 miles from
Lexington. The Virginia State
Police announce that one lane of
Interstate Route 81 will be
reserved for roller skaters and
bicyclers. Jogging, a pervasive
fad of the late 1970’s, is enjoying
a serious revival. A double
marathon is run every Satur-
day: Washington and Lee
students race 25 miles south and
Hollins women run 25 miles
north. The two groups meet in
Buchanan where several new

beer and disco joints do a
flourishing business. Mary
Baldwin College girls become
increasingly popular since
Staunton is only 30 level miles
away in contrast to the 45-50
miles of Blue Ridge Mountain
roads to Sweet Briar and
Randolph-Macon

Farm wagons, well padded
with hay, are the newest’ most
chic style of dating. They are
often equipped with extra plat-
‘forms for combos with battery-
powered amplifiers.
Rockbridge County officials
decide not to enact a noise or-
dinance as much of the
farmers’ income now comes
from the rental of horses and
wagons, plus an extra charge
for the hay.

In October 1984, the Board of
Trustees meeting in Buena
Vista hear a report from the
Dean of Admissions. Applica-
tions have dropped to 10% of the
past five years’ average. He
tells the Board that, excellent
as Washington and Lee’s educa-
tion is, high school students
everywhere say that if they
can’t get to the girls, they will
enroll where the action is. After
two days of debate the Trustees
vote that their deicsion of last
March was too hasty. So “in
keeping with Washington and
Lee’s commitment to a total
liberal arts education’’’ women
will be admitted as of
November 1, 1984.

Commerce School

Awarded Gift

The Harris and Eliza Kemp-
ner Fund of Galveston, Tex.,
has made.a $25,000 grant to
Washington and Lee University
in memory of the late Isaac H.
Kempner ‘Sr., an 1893 W&L
graduate.

The gift will be used toward
the $3.5-million cost of a new
home for the university’s School
of Commerce, Economics and
Politics. A unit in the facility
will be named for Mr. Kempner
in recognition of the founda-
tion’s gift and his notable
career.

. Isaac Kempner was the
eldest son of Harris and Eliza
Kempner, for whom the fund is
named. He was chairman of
U.S. National Bank in
Galveston and was mayor of the
city during World War I. Known
as “Mr. Galveston,” he was
honored by the W&L Alumni

Association at a banquet in his
honor in 1961. He died in 1967 at
the age of 94.

The commerce-school project
began this winter, and is ex-
pected to be completed in time
for the beginning of classes in
the 1980-81 academic year.

The new facility will provide
more than three times as much
space as the current commerce
building, Newcomb Hall, and
will have adequate classroom,
office, library and study space
for the School, now severely
overcrowded. In the past 43
years, since it was given full use
of Newcomb, the commerce
school has expanded its faculty
and curriculum by almost 200
percent, and the number of
students enrolled as majors has
increased from 18 percent of the
undergraduate student body to
45 percent.

(continued from page 1)

representatives abstained and
no representatives voted
against the proposal.

Many representatives took a
short break before plunging into
another hour of intense discus-
sion about next year’s rush.

In the past, fraternity
members were allowed to drink
alcohol between, but not during,
open houses.

The proposed change reads
“No alcoholic beverages will be
consumed during and in bet-
ween open houses.”’

“‘We’re trying to make the
rules stricter and keep them
from being wishy-washy,”’ said
Farrar.

He explained that the seman-
tics of certain rules in the past
has hindered enforcement.

Another example dealt with
contact. Formerly fraternities
have arranged to meet
freshmen at certain places and
give them rides to parties.

The IFC concedes that coin-
cidental contact is unavoidable,
“but no transportation can be
provided,” under the new rule.

But the biggest debate
centered on the change that
disallowed pledging until the
fourth rush date.

Five fraternities voted
against the measure and John
Snedden, of Phi Delta Theta, op-
posed the measure adamantly.

At one point discussion turned
into a shouting match between
Snedden and representatives of
SAE and Phi Kappa Sigma.

Most representatives argued
that the new rush calendar does

not allow freshmen and frater-
nity members to know each
other well by the first rush date
and that delaying pledging until
the fourth date will prevent
premature decisions.

Howard Smith of Phi Kap
stressed ‘‘the amount of
pressure four upperclassmen
can place on a freshman,”’ and
said any additional time on
campus will allow a freshman
to become just a little more
secure.

A rush calendar was devised
with rush scheduled to end on
Oct. 1, with the turning-in of
preference cards.

GLASSES ?

Here’s an effective new eye-exercise program that can
produce astonishing results in a very short time...

The Bettervision Eye Clinic is
now offering a program of eye-
exercises that can safety correct
most cases of poor eyesight—so
that glasses or contact lenses
are no longer needed. Originally
developed by Dr. William H. Bates
of the New York Eye Hospital, this
method has been widely used by the
Armed Forces, schools, clinics, and
thousands of private individuals, for
the treatment of:

@ nearsightedness
@ farsightedness
@ astigmatism

@ middle-age sight

For many years it was thought that
poor eyesight was just bad luck, or
something you inherit from your parents.
Scientists now know that most eyesight
problems are caused by accumulated
stress and tension—which squeeze the
eyeball out of shape, and affect the
muscles that do the Tanving The result
is the eye cannot form a clear image, and
the world appears to be blurry. In people
over 40, the natural aging process is also
an important factor.

No matter what
your eyesight problem
the Bates Method can help you.
This is a health care program,
and will benefit
everyone who follows it —
children, adults, and seniors.

It is important to understand that
lasses do not cure a visual problem.
hey are simply a compensating device

—like crutches. In fact, glasses usually
make the condition worse. Because they
make the eyes weak and lazy, a minor
problem often develops into a lifetime of
wearing glasses.

The Bates Me. oi corrects poor
— by strengthening the eye-
muscles and relaxing the eyeball. You do
simple easy exercises that increase your
focusing power, eliminate eyestrain, and
bring your eyesight back to normal.

Because the Bates Method deals with
the basic cause of your eyesight
problem, you can expect to see a definite
improvement in as little as 1 or 2 weeks.
Even if you have worn glasses all your
life—things will become clearer and
clearer, and you will have flashes of good
vision. . .as you gothrough the program,
these flashes become longer and more
frequent...gradually blending into
permanent better sight—at which point
the exercises are no longer necessary.

We usually find that people whose
eyesight is not too bad can return to
20/20 vision in about a month. Even if
your eyesight is really poor, within 2
to 3 months you should be able to put
away your cesar once and for all. Read
these case histories:

 

Aldous Huxley—Nobel Author

‘‘My vision was getting steadily worse,
even with greatly strengthened glasses.
To my dismay | realized I was going
blind. On the advice of my Doctor I
decided to try the Bates Method. There
was an immediate improvement. After
only 2 months I was able to read clearly
without glasses. Better still, the cataract
which had covered part of one eye for
over 16 years was beginning toclear up.”

Rev. Frederick A. Milos, M.S.

‘By following the simple exercises given
in this a. I have coapictaty
recovered my vision. Now | can read for

long periods without my glasses.”’

Ron Moore—Technician

“I originally went to the Clinic to deliver
some equipment—and ended up trying
their eye-exercise program. I am near-
sighted, and have worn glasses for 15
yrs. In just 3 weeks after starting
the program, my eyesight has already
improved to the point where I can now
drive, do business, and watch T.V.—all
without my glasses!"

11-6 Lacrosse Win
Sets Up Saturday
Duel With Roanoke

The W&L lacrosse Generals
defeated the Shoremen of
Washington College, 11-6 on
Saturday in Chestertown, Md.
The closeness of the score is
deceiving as the Generals
dominated the game, winning
many key statistical areas.

After Washington College
jumped to an early 1-0 lead,
W&L scored seven unanswered
goals between the mid-way
points of the first and third
periods to put the game away.
This outburst was highlighted
by three goals from junior at-
tackman Jay Foster.

Taking a 9-2 lead into the last
period, the Generals, as has
been the case in other games
this year, began to play
cautiously and allowed
Washington College to gain
momentum and close the score
to 10-6.

With under four minutes to go
in the game, Washington Col-
lege gave it one last try and
came up with two excellent
scoring chances, only to be
frustrated by junior goalie Bob
Clements. For his efforts
Clements was named the ‘‘Can-
non Player of the Game’, an
award that he has won on two

previous occasions.
The W&L attack received
goals from eight different

players, and continue to be led
by the “Big Three’’, Black,
Fritz, and Foster who ac-
counted for nine points in the
contest.

Coach Jack Emmer is
cautiously optimistic about his
teams chances of making the
NCAA tournament knowing
that they must win their two re-
maining games against
Roanoke (ranked second in
Division II-II]) and Hofstra
(ranked fifteenth in Division I)
to receive a bid.

Generals To Take
Europe Trip In’79

by Bill Whalen

The Washington and Lee
basketball team has announced
plans to take an international
tour over the Christmas break
portion of the 1979-80 season.
According to Coach Verne Can-
field, the tour will encompass
“six countries: Iceland, Ger-
many, France, Holland, Lux-
embourg and the Bahamas.”

 

The team will also play in a
tournament in Florida before
returning to Lexington.

In order to pay for the trip,
the basketball team is now in
the process of raising close to
$17,000. The team has several
plans for coming up with the
funds, including a raffle for a
basket of ‘“‘cheer,’’ a running

Tennis Team Dominates
ODAC Tourney; Jackson
Captures Singles Title

by Nat Lovell

The Generals rebounded from
a loss to the Wahoos to take the
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference Championships in Lyn-
chburg over the weekend of
April 27-28. This victory retains
the W&L tennis team’s perfect
record in competition versus
ODAC teams.

On April 25, the netmen
travelled to The Homestead for
a match with the University of
Virginia. The Division I school
came away the winners by the

score of 8-1. Stewart Jackson
put up a fight in a close first set
but Hank Harris took control
and took the match 7-5,6-1. With
Shaw Cranfield ailing from a
sore back, Doug Gaker moved
into the number two slot only to
be met head on by Adam Brock
who won 6-1,6-0. Dave Constine

seems to be finding some of his

old form though he lost a close
match to Brent Hendecks
7-6,6-4. Wes Yonge was shut out
of his match with Rodney
Crowley 6-0,60. Bob Schuler
lost in three sets to Stuart
Horsley 6-1,3-6,6-2.

Jackson and Constine had it
their way in doubles as they
earned the Generals’ only point
by defeating Harris and Brock

7-6,6-2. The University of
Virginia netmen swept the re-
maining doubles to complete
the victory.

The team dominated the
ODAC Championships with 68
points. Hampden-Sydney and
Randolph-Macon followed with
56 points and 48 points respec-
tively. Jackson cruised through
the Number 1 division tourna-
ment taking the final over Mc-
Cauly of H-S 6-3,6-3. Cranfield
also breezed through his divi-

sion taking the final over Kevin

   

it to the finals before falling to
the Hampden-Sydney duo 6-3,
7-5.

The Generals kept the
momentum going as_ they
defeated James Madison on
Sunday by the score of 7-2.
Jackson started slowly but
came back to whip Steve Gill
3-6,6-0,6-3. Cranfield beat Ed
Barnhardt 6-3,6-3. Gaker fell to
Mark Snead 6-2,6-1. Constine
won a see-saw battle with John
Witt 6-1,1-6,7-6. Norris lost a
close match to Dave Rigotti

Baseball Season Over

by Chris Sisto

The General’s varsity
baseball team played only three
games last week and dropped
them all as their long season
nears an end. Their overall
record is 4-15 and their com-
pleted ODAC record is 2-8.

In the first of the three mat-
ches the Generals could not
muster any hitting attack in los-
ing to the Lynchburg cham-
pions, 7-0. Then, on Sunday, tlhe
Generals dropped a

doubleheader to ODAC oppo-
ncnt Emory and Henry, 3-2 and
6-3.

The opener was close
throughout as the Generals
gave up one run in the last inn-
ing to lose the game.

In the second game the
Generals could not get any hit-
ting attack going as they were
outgunned in a _ darkness
shortened game.

The Generals’ last two games
were played yesterday in a
doubleheader at VMI.

5-7,7-5,6-2. Yonge pulled out a
victory over Chris Laybourne
3-6,6-0,6-4. The netmen went on
to take all doubles in three sets.
Four straight days of mat-
ches took its toll on the team as
they lost 7-2 to VPI. Jackson ran
out of gas after a close first set,
and Jim Milley ran out the
match 7-5, 6-0. Cranfield fought

Gaker and Yonge
romped through the second
division winning 6-0,6-2 in the
finals. Norris and Schuier made

his way to a 7-6,6-4 victory over
Jim Wingo. Gaker was crushed
by Bob McIntosh 6-2,6-0. Con-
stine lost to Bill Hamilton
6-2,7-6. Norris was defeated by
Ron Paquette 6-2,6-2. Yonge
was a 6-2,6-3 loser to Dean
Channell.

Jackson and Cranfield won
their doubles match 6-2,6-2 for
the Generals’ other point.

Golfers Finish At 14-2, Second In ODAC:
But Still Are Uncertain Of NCAA Bid

The Washington & Lee golf
team, which has enjoyed an
outstanding year of victories,
finished up its regular season
play with a 14-2 record. The
season was capped by a 4-
match victory at Ingleside in
Staunton, against Randolph-
Macon (team score total of 417),
Bridgewater (417), Radford
(434) and Roanoke (forfeit).
The W&L team score was 377
for the May 1 matches.

Gerry Barousse and Andy
Fitzgerald ended the day as co-
medalists, both shooting a 74 on
the par-72 Ingleside course.

In other golf play, the
Generals finished a strong se-
cond in the ODAC golf tourna-
ment held last Monday in
Ashland, Virginia. The
Generals’ team total was 600 for
the April 23 game, coming in
with a 14-stroke lead over third
place Roanoke while tagging
only ten strokes behind cham-
pion Lynchburg College.

Again, Barousse was the
Championship medalist,
finishing with a two-round total

team will also sell souvenir
booklets which will com-
memorate the highlights of the
tour.

The important thing to
remember about this trip is that
the funds will be collected solely
by the basketball team. ‘We
are not going to tap any of the
alumni,”’ said Canfield. “We
want their input but we do not
want their money.”’

The coach was also very en-
thusiastic about the uniqueness
of a trip to Europe. ‘‘You have
to remember that no other col-
lege in the United States is plan-
ning this sort of trip,’ said Can-
field. ‘‘To say the least, this is
something that has never been
done at Washington and Lee.

in Europe but that is not as im-
portant as is taking the trip,”’
added the coach.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Nostalgia and
rude awakenings

The senior banquet, sponsored by the Alumni
Association, is another of those ‘“‘resurrected events”’
which have recently soared in popularity — just like
Fancy Dress in 1974. The overwhelming majority of
the undergraduate seniors were present, and a
healthy number of law seniors, with professors and
staff filling out the circle. For many, it was a mixed
bag of nostalgia, sentiment, and the first rude
awakening that alumni status will come to the class of
1979 in just over a month.

The banquet was climaxed by the presentation of
the Gilliam Award, to the student who has “‘rendered
the greatest service to the University.’’ We are told
that the debate, resulting in the selection of student
body president Beau Dudley, was an unusually short
one for the selection committee. It comes as little sur-
prise. Quite simply, Duuley is one of the most ar-
ticulate, organized, and fair student leaders this cam-
pus has ever been privileged to call to office. After a
year of turbulence for many student groups in 1977-78,
Dudley brought an aura of efficiency from the earliest
weeks of his term in office. Setting the tone for the
EC, but never infringing on each member’s right of
expression, he was an ideal choice when the time
came to recognize a leader. Our heartiest congratula-
tions....

Bringing back the senior banquet last year was
especially welcome to the Ring-tum Phi, giving us a
‘soap box”’ on which to present our annual achieve-
ment awards. This year, we were pleased to
recognize seven very special people, who have cer-
tainly given that “‘little extra” referred to by previous
editors when listing their choices. Specific events or
achievements have always been a favorite area for
our selections; hence, no awards could be more ap-
propriate than the ones awarded to librarian Maurice
Leach and senior Steve Mangan for their astonishing
Library Move in January. The 1,600 people they
mobilized for the day may be the greatest evidence
against those perennial charges of ‘‘W&L apathy”’....

James Whitehead has worked diligently for W&L
for some 20 years; our award to him is in specific ap-
preciation for his efforts in bringing the Herreshoff
paintings to their rightful place in the public eye.
Others receiving awards for their service — to the
Ring- tum Phi in particular — were Pam Hartless and
Fred Clark, whose production expertise and over 20
years of combined experience helped the paper to ex-
pand nearly 200% in the past two years.

No sonner did I mention W&L’s own “‘leprechaun,”’
who magically created the greatest charity event
ever seen at W&L, than the audience bellowed for Jay
Blumberg to stand. Smiling in the face of possible (if
not probable) failure for four months, his energy car-
ried the MD Dance Marathon to a $17,000 mark —
three times the predicted goal. It is most reassuring
to know that this ace organizer will be part of our Ex-
ecutive Committee next year.

And finally...what can you say about everybody’s
second mother? The mention of Betty Miller’s name
as our final honoree brought every senior to his
feet—as if by instinct. I think for many of us she
epitomizes the spirit and warmth of W&L, which the
senior class will be leaving all too soon. As she herself
can tell you, graduate schools won’t be providing can-
dy to go with those bad report cards....

An outstanding group of caring individuals....We
are more than pleased that the senior banquet and the
Ring-tum Phi awards are again joined in an annual

celebration.

Correction

Some of the White Book
changes were inaccurately
reported in last week’s Ring-
tum Phi. The proposal that
would make anything a suspect
says to an EC member usable
against him was voted down.
The EC’s policy regarding
aquittal, which was not a White
Book change, should have read
that it takes two-thirds of the
EC to aquit a suspect.

artists like Peaches & Herb,
Donna Summer, and Sylvester
would without a doubt cut down
on the anti-disco backlash by
demonstrating the truth of the
old adage, ‘‘anything done well
can be entertaining.”

‘What a Fool Believes’—

 

Fraternity Academic
Standings
Winter Term, 1979

  

Doobie Brothers—Putting all
questions of objectivity aside
for a moment, i should say that
in my book ‘‘What A Fool
Believes’ is one of the best
singles to hit the charts so far
this year. I think the main thing
about this one is the rhythm; it
could pass for disco (in fact, it
made number 38 on Billboard’s
Disco Hot 80), but it also rocks
with a sort of quiet intensity
that’s really quite unique. Com-
bine that with the kind of ar-

ranging and production you’d
expect from the Doobies,. and
you come up with something a
cut above most of the competi-
tion.

And as long as we’re in a com-
mercial vein, a recent album
release on the Berserkly label
deserves mention. If you enjoy
light, well-played,  well-
produced, _ singles-oriented
music, check out the Rubinoos’
latest, Back to the Drawing
Board—it’s pop perfection.

David P. Robbins, assistant

methods of shuffling cards, and
Robert L. Wilson Jr., associate

think this shows better balance
than in recent years.”

Leslie recalled that his
golfers went to the nationals in
1977, finishing seventh out of 20
teams. ‘‘I think we’re even a lit-
tle better now,” he said.

He expects Lynchburg to get
the NCAA nod for final play.
“Still, we deserve a bid as well.
We beat Lynchburg two out of
three times this year, losing on-
ly in ODAC play.” And, it is
possible — as it happened in
1977 — that two ODAC teams
could be slated for the NCAA
matches, though other con-
ference teams are within the
same selection area as W&L.

SAB Concert Cancelled; §

Contract Agents Blamed

by Gray Coleman

and Ross Newell
In an interview Tuesday,
Assistant Dean of Students
Michael Cappeto stated the
reasons behind the cancellation
of the Student Activities Board

concert featuring Firefall,
scheduled for last Saturday
night.

Cappeto began by stating,
“The point is that Washington
and Lee shouldn’t be in this
business. We don’t have the
manpower or facilities for these
big concerts. Madison, for ex-
ample, has 3 full-time profes-
sionals plus their student ac-
tivites board, to make these
concerts go. . . I just don’t see
how we can go on and agree to
bring bands when what they
want is so much different, from
what we can possibly provide.”

Firefall’s advance manager,
who arrived at W & L early on
Saturday, informed Cappeto
that stage and power facilities
were inadequate. The band
workers inferred that the stage
— a 32-by-40 foot rental unit
from Richmond, which cost the

Colonnade
Detaced
Saturday

by Mike Perry
Washington Hall was van-
dalized sometime after 2:00 last
Saturday morning. University
Proctor Charles F. Murray is
currently investigating the inci-
dent and reports that the van-
dals smeared black paint
across the white doors to
Washington Hall, three columns
and a plaque honoring the Col-
onnade’s distinction as a Na-
tional Historic Landmark.
Murray points out that this
sort of vandalism occurs ‘‘at
least once or twice a year,” and
that while there are many possi-
ble suspects, he believes that a
W&L student probably did it.
Murray relates the vandalism
to another incident occurring
last Friday in Graham-Lees
Dorm in which a dorm
counselor lost $30 and a ring,
and adds that this kind of thing
has “‘happened some all year.”’
Although he ‘hasn't come up
with anything yet,’’ Murray ful-
ly expects that something will
be discovered. A handprint was
found on one of the columns, but
it is doubtful that any of the
fingerprints will prove helpful.
The University has repainted
the doors and columns, and
may have to have the plaque
repaired, but the incident did
not cause any lasting damage.

SAB approximately $500 in spite
of its not being used — ‘wasn’t
of good quality, which is
debatable,’ according to Cap-
peto.

The stage size was just one
point in a hurricane of conten-
tions and mistakes in com-
munication between the band’s
agent, International Creative
Management (ICM), and the
SAB’s_ entertainment broker,
Entertainment Directions.

The Firefall contracts, dated
April 4, 1979, arrived several
weeks ago and the actual agree-
ment met with no objections.
But a series of ‘‘riders,”’ or pro-
mises which must be made by
W&L in addition to contract
price, which numbered several
pages, were As Cappeto stated
— ‘absolutely impossible to
carry out.”

The first rider required the
SAB to pay 50% of the fee even
if the band didn’t play. Cappeto
refused to sign this point ... and
many others which followed, in-
cluding requests that he called
“really entertaining to read.”’

These included the following:
4 immense follow-spots which
“would've fried them on
stage,’’ as Cappeto said; a com-
plete headphone system all
around the hall; a piano tuner,
registered member of the Piano
Technicians’ Guild, available
for sixhours before the show;
all student workers to turn in
their student ID’s to the stage
manager as collateral that they
would remain to help re-load
the band equipment; 12x15 foot
carpeted rooms — one each for

 

 

Washington Hall.

i SZ di sil
Buildings and Grounds workers repair Saturday's damage to

‘guitar tuning,” ‘‘horn rehear-
sal,”’ and so on; full meals, in-
cluding 4 vegetarian dinners;
bottles of Jack Daniels, Remy
Martin Cognac, Cuervo Gold
Tequila, and 3 cases of
Heineken Beer; and more
Heineken and cognac available
with ice ten minutes before the
performance.

With all this, the immediate
cause of caneslilation was
W&l.'s inability to provide 300
amps of ‘‘necessary power’’ in
Doremus Gymnasium. Cappeto
states, ‘‘when the advance peo-
ple got here at 11 a.m., I could
tell they wouldn’t want to play

James W. Whitehead,
treasurer of Washington and
Lee University since 1966 and
secretary of the Board of
Trustees since 1968, will leave
his financial management
duties next Jan. 1 to devote in-
creased attention to his board
duties and to expanded respon-
sibilities for university develop-
ment activities and the curator-
ship of W&L’s nationally impor-
tant art collections.

The university said E.
Stewart Epley of Stephentown,
N.Y., a 1949 Phi Beta Kappa
graduate of Washington and
Lee in accounting who was
formerly the chief financial

analyst for a $1-billion series of
college building programs in
New York State, will join the
W&L administration July 1 as

assistant to Whitehead with the
expectation that he will succeed
Whitehead as treasurer six
months later.

Since 1974, Epley has been a
“development staff associate’
of Washington and Lee and has
worked full time in that capaci-
ty since 1977. Development staff
associates represent the univer-
sity in a wide range of opera-
tions, primarily in fund-raising
with additional responsibilities
in alumni relations and admis-
sions, in various geographical
areas of the country where
Washington and Lee has par-
ticular historical strength.
Epley’s area has included most
of the northeast, from New
York, New Jersey, Penn-
sylvania and Ohio through all of
New England.

Whitehead will assume
substantially enlarged duties as
W&L’'s board secretary under
the new arrangement, the
university said. He succeeded
Robert E. R. Huntley in that
capacity when the latter was
elected president 11 years ago.
Shortly afterward, the W&L
board was _ substantially
reorganized, and the new, more
active board has long required
more extensive liaison with the
on-campus university ad-

Fraternity Proposal

The faculty reached no deci-

A special faculty meeting will

In addition to a proposal sub-
mitted to the faculty by Dr. Ed-

Brawl Occurs At

by David Greer

Several Washington and Lee
students and a Hollins student
sustained injuries or were
sprayed with Mace during an
incident with Hollins security
guards Monday night.

The incident occured just
before 1:30 a.m. when several
students were leaving West
Dormitory by the side exit. One
witness said they were just
standing around when a securi-
ty guard came out with a fire
extinguisher in his hand.

The guard accused one of the
students, Michael Devine, a
junior, with spraying it in the
dorms. Devine denied doing
this.

A student who was in the
dorms earlier said he saw an
extinguisher sprayed, but
Devine was not the one spray-
ing it.

Devine said when he denied
shooting the extinguisher the
guard, Eugene Wright, ‘‘just
went beserk”’ and attacked him.

“IT ran into the cop station,”
said Devine. ‘‘I wanted to com-

plain about him. I wanted to
find out if they were carrying
guns.”’

A student who saw the inci-
dent said that the guard had
tried to make Devine leave but
Devine physically resisted dur-
ing a heated verbal exchange.
The witness said the guard
pushed Devine or tried to hit
him.

Devine said, ‘‘I wasn’t doing
any fighting. He was trying to
fight me.”

Mark Turner, a sophomore,
said he saw another guard runn-
ing toward Devine. He said he
tried to stop him, telling him
Devine had not done anyting
wrong.

Turner and the guard fell
over a bench and Wright, ac-
cording to witnesses, ran over
and started spraying Mace at
Turner. Richard Keatley said
he tried to separate Turner and
the other guard when he was
pushed down on the ground.

“IT was pinned down. I didn’t
try to swing or anything,”

EC Endorses Pavillion Plan;
Univ. Council Elections Held

by David Greer
The Student Body Executive
Committee endorsed a plan to
build a facility for student par-
ties on the back campus.
Student Body President Beau
Dudley said he has been work-
ing on an ad hoc pavillion com-
mittee to look into the feasibili-
ty of building a facility for
“alumni gatherings, student
parties, and small concerts.”

clude picnic and cookout

head. He sprayed my face, in
Turner’s face...’’ Keatley said
two other people were also
sprayed.

One Hollins student who was
at the scene was also sprayed
and had to be taken to the in-
firmary. She has been released.

Junior Baker Spring said
when he tried to separate
Turner and one of the guards he
was also sprayed from behind
and was temporarily blinded.

Keatley had lacerations on
his forehead and Turner said he
was unable to see to drive home
and had to let Devine, who
escaped before the spraying,
drive.

Spring and Devine spoke with

facilities, could be rented by
students, faculty, and organiza-
tions. Possible sites for the com-
plex include an area above the
law school or near Liberty Hall.

Dudley said it is possible that
financing for the building would
come from the Student Activity
Tax.

The advantages of the facility
would lie largely in its location.
The areas considered would not
threaten the town’s noise or-
dinance, would reduce student
trips to other similar facilities
out of town, and would provide
an accessible place for use by
students who do not have
transportation to other similar
facilities.

Having been endorsed by the
EC, the plan will probably go to
the Board of Trustees, Dudley
said.

In other EC business, Contact
spokesman Jim Tommins said
Ralph Nader is scheduled to
speak here May 24. Contact
could not get Tom Wolf to speak
this year.

EC secretary Tom McCarthy
announced a plan to have all EC
records stored in the University
Archives, except those from the
past five years. These records
would be open to anyone in-
terested in seeing them, but
would not include confidential
records involving honor trials.

Wenke
Receives

Luce Award

Michael F. Wenke, a senior
psychology major. at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, is one of 15 men and women
in the nation named Luce
Scholars for a_ year’s
postgraduate study in the Far
East.

Wenke will graduate from
W&L with high honors in June.
He becomes Washington and
Lee’s second Luce Scholar since
the program was established
five years ago. Washington and
Lee is one of 60 colleges selected
by the Henry A. Luce Founda-
tion of New York to participate
in the program.

The Luce Fellowship carries
a stipend in addition to travel
expenses. The program is uni-
que in that it is open only to non-
Asian specialists.

Wenke, captain of
Washington and Lee’s basket-
ball team and student director
of the university’s intramurals
program, is also an upperclass
counselor in the freshman dor-
mitories and was selected for
inclusion in ‘‘Who’s Who in
American Colleges and Univer-
sities” this year.

The Luce Foundation was
created in 1936 by the co-
founder of Time Inc., Henry R.
Luce. Since his death in 1967,
the foundation has made grants
of more than $14 million dollars
for specific projects in the fields
of theology, higher education
both here and in the Far East,
and public affairs.

Musical Mainstream

Breakfast in America
Supertramp

In order to get all questions of
objectivity (or lack of same)
out of the way right at the begin-
ning, I must confess to having
been a Supertramp fan from
way back. 1 claim no particular
musical foresight with regard
to the band (well, not much)—
it’s just that I was living in Mon-
treal when their first album
came out, and they were in-
credibly popular there even
four or five years ago.

Still, even though I was look-
ing forward to the release of the
new album, I resisted the temp-
tation to put my thoughts on it
into writing until now. The
album was charted at number
three with a bullet in Billboard
this week, and its commercial
success is just hard to ignore.

The similarities of Breakfast
in America to Supertramp’s
classic Crime of the Century
are several. The group uses a

Eye And Ear:

Scholarly writing is solid —
and frequently stolid — use of
language. The careful in-
vestigator of, say, an historical
period is deeply involved in the
minutiae of events and forces.
He wants to pack as much in-
formation as possible into his
book. Such history tomes might
be called the pemmican of
writing. High in nutritional
value, they require strong teeth
and sturdy jaws. They make for
tough chewing.

But what about an
undergraduate who wishes to
read of historical events in a
more general and dramatic
fashion? There are such books,
both fiction and nonfiction. The
facts in them are correct and
balanced, yet they move along
at a more spritely pace. The
prose is lively yet the informa-
tion is deadly accurate.

The Guns of August by Bar-
bara Tuchman is a prime exam-
ple. The build-up to the beginn-
ing of World War I and the hor-
rors of that awful first month
are graphically presented. The
Glory and the Dream by
William Manchester gives a
bread sweeping picture of the
past forty years of American
life. Bruce Catton’s three-
volume centennial history of the

Civil War is vivid and exciting.
(I confess to having sat up until
2 a.m. one night to.read how it

all came out!) Other books
which come to mind are The
Greek Way by Edith Hamilton,
Game Plan for Disaster by
Clark Mollenhoff and The
United States and China by
John Fairbank

There is good fiction, too.
Athens during her final days as
a free state in The Last of the
Wine by Mary Renault, and
Shogun by James Clavell about

show’’, for example), and one of
the new record’s standout
tracks, ‘Long Way Home’,
uses the same sort of haunting
harmonica opening as the open-
ing track from Crime (Supertra
calls yet another song, ‘Gone
Hollywood”’ its ‘‘last link’’ to
Crime of the Century).

Despite the inevitable com-
parisons, however, Breakfast in
America easily stands on its
own as one of the best LPs
released so far this year.
Whether you like the band or
not, Supertra is and has always
been unique in its melodies and
overall sound (not to mention
concert sound—check ’em out if
you can). Rick Davies’ vocals
are as good as ever on the new
album, and Roger
Hodgson’sstill tend to get on my
nerves. In short. if you haven’t
joined the Supertramp band-
wagon yet, now may well be the
time. Ignore the single (“The
Logical Song’) and buy the
LP—it’s well worth the money.

North Star Band To Perform

Appearing tonight in the

Cockpit for their first ap-~

pearance on this campus is the
North Star Band, from
Washington, D.C. They are
highly recommended by the
Allstars and Skip Castro Band,
as well as the guys playing this
Tuesday, the Nighthawks.
Their music is a fusion of many
styles — rock, jazz, R & B and
country — and is combined to
form a style that is all their own
— “KickAss Country.” Their

ing the lead guitar, piano, and

the band has proven itself to be
one of today’s most dynamic

that their reception will be so
good that she can route other
excellent acts from Atlanta

Baseball Improves

Under Chuck Kroll

by Chris Sisto

If one word could sum up the
1979 baseball season, according
to head coach Chuck Kroll, it
would be ‘“‘frustration.’’ The
Generals showed this as they
finished the season with a bitter
taste in their mouths, dropping
a doubleheader to rival VMI, 3-2
and 6-3. They were in both
games but were overcome in
the late innings when no timely
hitting was produced. The
Generals finished out the
season at 4-17 over all and 2-8 in
ODAC play

The frustration and poor
record is blamed on tough luck
and youth. Kroll said, ‘‘We real-
ly didn’t get our share of the
breaks this year and we
couldn't put it together because
of this.’’ Kroll mentioned a few
‘bad breaks’’ independent of
the team’s play. One example is
scheduling. During the April
break the Generals had to play
seven games in six days. “We
couldn't have any formal prac-
tices during exam week
because of school regulations
and then had to go out and play
a major league  schedule,”’
Coach Kroll added later.

The youth problem caused
some inexperience in a few of

the losses. “Our team was
tough enough to be in most of
the games,” Kroll said, ‘‘but
several times in close contests
our inexperience killed us.”
This is proven by a look at the
Generals roster. There are only
four seniors graduating and
seven other upperclassmen.
The rest of the team is made up
of fifteen freshmen.

Despite the disappointment of
this season, Coach Kroll is
pleased with many aspects of
his team and is optimistic of the
Generals’ future. ‘‘Although our
record wasn’t so great, I ac-

compl shed some of the goals —

I'd set at the beginning of the
year and I know some of the
players fulfilled some of
theirs,’’ he said. However, he
didn’t say exactly which goals
he set or made. Coach Kroll was
also pleased with the team’s at-
titude. He called the team ‘‘gut-
sy” and said they never gave
up. Kroll was happy about the
enthusiasm from the school.
“The administration was very
supportive,’ he said ‘‘and the
maintenance department did a
helluva job getting the field
ready for our games.”’

As for the future. Coach Kroll

12-10 Loss To Roanoke
Jeopardizes NCAA Bid

by Doug Linton
The Varsity stickmen ran into
hard luck on Saturday as they
fell 12-10 at the hands of their
rivals from Roanoke College.
This lessens the Generals’

chances for a playoff bid, but
does not kill them by any
means.

Both on paper and on the
field, W&L was clearly the
dominant force for most of the

 

General’s 12-10 loss at Roanoke.

game. Unfortunately, the first
quarter and, ultimately, the
game belonged to Roanoke.
Roanoke exploded early and
before the Generals could get
settled down, they were on the
short end of a 40 score. John
Black took a John Kemp pass on
an extra-man situation and
fired it home for the only W&L
goal of the period. Roanoke add-

fee a 2s.

A Look At:

 

ed two more and at the end of

 

the first quarter it was 6-1.

As if the lead wasn’t big
enough, one more got past
goalie Bob Clements not much
more than a minute into the se-
cond quarter and it was 7-1.
From this point on W&L took
full control of the game, but
their recovery efforts fell short
as Roanoke was still able to
squirt a few more into the net
before the contest was over.

The Generals outscored their
opponents 3-2 in the second
period. After Art Caltrider
scored and John Black got
another, it was a little closer at
7-3. Roanoke got one more
before Mike Pressler dented the
net, and at halftime the
Generals still trailed, 8-4.

Jay Foster and Kemp got two
more tallies for W&L at start of
the third period and things were
looking up for the Generals as
the gap closed to 8-6. But before
the third period was over
Roanoke netted two more, mak-
ing it 10-6 with only a quarter to
play.

Although the \“enerals never
led in the game, t. ey rallied for
three very quick yoals within
five minutes of the final
quarter. Black had his third of
the day, followed by Kemp’s se-
cond and an unassisted goal by
George Santos.

Washington & Lee Golf

by Ed Taylor

What is it like to play golf at
Washington and Lee and why
would a student attend W&L in-
stead of a Division 1 school to
play golf?

The golf program W&L pro-
vides ‘‘a chance for a boy to
continue with his athletic in-
terest without causing major in-
roads into his academic pur-
suits,’ explained Coach Buck
Leslie. W&L’s philosophy
toward athletics is that a stu-
dent must pursue academics
first and athletics second.
Coach Leslie impresses this
upon his golfers and they come
to realize that golf at W&L is in-
deed a supplement to their
classwork. In addition, the ap-
proach to W&L golf is low-key in
the sense that no_ athletic
scholarships are given but at
the same time it is a determined
one in its pursuit for athletic ex-
cellence.

Because no athletic scholar-
ships per se are awarded, a
W&L golfer relies on his love for
the game and the desire for
competition as his motivating
forces. Furthermore, little
recognition is awarded to the
golf team when compared with
lacrosse, football, or basket-
ball. As a result, the players
must retain their satisfaction
from the game through in-
dividual pride.

This year’s team compiled a
14-2 record, finished second in
the ODAC tournament and

received an NCAA bid to the
Division III playoffs to be held
May 15-18. This marks the third
straight time that W&L has
received an NCAA bid. In 1977,
the team finished as ODAC
champions and ranked 7th na-
tionally. In 1978 the team
repeated as ODAC champions
and returned to the NCAA tour-
nament. Furthermore, Coach
Leslie was named ODAC’s
Coach of the Year in both 1977
and 1978.

Jerry Maatman, Washington
and Lee’s first golf All-
American wrote an article con-
cerning what golf at W&L

 

appearance.

Guts like this have led the golf team are ee

meant to him in his four years
at W&L. In the article he said,
“Although two schools in the
Big Ten Conference offered me
athletic scholarships, I chose
Washington and Lee because of
its excellent reputation and the
University’s philosophy of pro-
moting intercollegiate sports as
a supplement to a student’s
total college education.”
Indeed, the student-athlete
philosophy that Maatman
pointed out and the fact that a
student is given the chance to
participate in college athletics
are two of the major aspects of
the golf program at W&L.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Notes and
more notes

If any student group has a right to feel disillusioned,
we must grant it to the Student Activities Board. After
amassing a large profit on Fancy Dress, the SAB op-
timistically planned a major concert for the spring—
only to have the performance fall through in the face
of a web of complicated contract promises, which
W&L simply cannot provide. Through no fault of their
own, the SAB and the student body have lost nearly
$2,000 of their funds—and the prevailing attitude now
is one of contemplation. Should W&L even bother to
try booking ‘‘big name”’ concert groups in the future?

Compared with the concert halls in Roanoke and
Charlottesville, our own facilities are clearly—and
understandably—less extensive. Many campus
figures feel that W&L can no longer compete in this
business. To that end, there is scheduled a conference
of student and administration leaders to debate the
question next week. If you have any opinions or sug-
gestions in this area, contact an SAB member before
next week...

a

W&L’s Alpha Circle of ODK enlarges its range of
activities every year, and Vice-President Craig Cor-
nett organized one of the most impressive of these re-
cent events yesterday: a ‘“community symposium”’ of
leading town and student figures. Several dozen peo-
ple participated in the 3-hour conference, which
covered topics from fraternity controversy to the
pressures of reporting an honor violation.

Virtually all the townspeople present expressed
their gratitude for the chance to become “‘better in-
formed.” And they were free to share their insights
with the students—the most surprising fact being that
none of them had evil words to say about fraternities
this year. Most noted a recent improvement in
behavior and apprearance, and even more asserted
that fraternities are no worse now than they were
decades ago. So all you indecisive faculty members,
please take note...

For the first time in some five years, a public honor
trial was held this morning in Lee Chapel. These hear-
ings are open (and to be heard) only by members of
the W&L community; since the circulation of the

not cover the trial in regular news fashion. Even so,
we encourage any letters or opinions on the conduct of
the hearing and its effectiveness.

Letters To The Editor

Thanks to RtP-Race workers

Dear Editor,

This past Sunday the Third Annual Ring-
tum-Phi 15 KM Road Race was run through
the streets of Lexington and Rockbridge
County. I wish to express my appreciation to
the thirty-five students, dates and W&L staff
members who came out at 6:30 Sunday morn-
ing as volunteer race marshalls, timers, etc.
Four hundred fifty-eight dollars was raised
for the fight against Multiple Sclerosis.

Special thanks go out to President Huntley
who started the race, race co-chairmen Jack

Coffey and Fernando Mancias, and Mike
Wenke, Jim Berlin, Craig Cornett, Mike
Powell, Jay Blumberg, Joe Dashiell, Henry
Weeks and Coach Dick Miller. The race was a
great success due to the hard work of the
aforementioned volunteers and the runners,
who came from all over the state and were
very pleased with the course and organization
of the race, many committing themselves
already for next year’s race.

Jerry Darrell

Race Director

Low academic interest condemned

Dear Editor:

Events over the past year here at W&L
have prompted me to question the health of
intellectual excitement on this campus. A
friend started my doubts about the at-
mosphere when he quoted a professor who
said the student body’s attitude toward
studies was awful. Although my first reaction
was defensive, I’m afraid I can’t be as sup-
portive of the atmosphere here as I once was.

Washington and Lee presents itself as a
school humming with intellectual curiosity
and activity. But where is that curiosity and
activity? Where is that desire to expose
ourselves to the educational and cultural op-
portunities the school offers? How much drive
is there to get a broad liberal arts education
and to develop our capacity to understand a
wide variety of disciplines? I do not see that
curiosity, that activity, that desire, or that
drive, and the absence of _ those
characteristics disturbs me.

What has contributed to my dissatisfac-
tion? Miniscule attendance at the concerts the
music department arranges; almost negligi-
ble attendance among students not required
to attend. Generally light attendance at Con-
tact presentations. A conversation in which a
student says there is no way he could take a
particular course that meets early Tuesday
and Thursday mornings because he would
still be hungover from the party Wednesday
night. Another conversation: a student is
disgusted that a professor insists the student
attend class even though the student is taking
the course pass-fail. A student asking me to
recommend an easy course or two for the next
term. Not an interesting course, but an easy
course. Professors being routinely evaluated
on the basis of their grading, not on their
teaching ability or knowledge.

A friend had a liberal arts curriculum last
term that consisted of: managerial finance,
regulated industries, business law, and com-
puter science. That’s a tough schedule, but it
hardly reflects a quest for an understanding
of the mysteries of the universe or the human
condition. Some people will be alarmed that I
would draw a generalization of the whole stu-
dent body from the schedule of one friend, but
the point is that I don’t think that schedule or
the attitude about Thursday morning classes
or the attitude about attending classes in a
pass-fail course or the desire to find easy
courses is an isolated incident. I think those
attitudes are fairly prevalent, and I wonder

where I can find the intellectualism that col-
lege campuses are supposed to foster.

As much as the faculty complains about the
students’ declining interest in academics in
recent years, I don’t think the entire blame
should rest on the students. In a couple of
classes I took recently, the professor an-
nounced a special help class as exams
neared. That’s admirable, but the professor
then felt obliged to cancel one of the
regularly-scheduled classes to ‘‘make up’’ to
the students, I suppose, the inconvenience of
coming to the help session. The professor’s
own attitude and teaching ability have an im-
portant effect on the class’ interest. That ef-
fect has certainly been strong in my
academic life, and I think a professor should
first react to any detected drop in interest by
examining his teaching methods.

I won’t be simplistic. Low interest in
academics, if it has hit this campus recently,
as the faculty maintains, is not entirely the
result of any faction’s force on campus;
neither the faculty nor the students nor frater-
nity life nor the administration is totally at
fault for the low level of intellectualism at
Washington and Lee. Am I the only one to
notice the overemphasis on grades among the
students? Am I the only student who is
disturbed about parties’ reign at academics’
expense? I am not presumptuous enough to
think so. But if there is a widespread percep-
tion that the intellectual atmosphere here is in
poor health, we should try to alter the com-
bination of teachers’ skills, students’
backgrounds, fraternity activity, and ad-
ministration priorities to produce a stronger
interest in the intellectual side of college life.

I would never say college exists merely for
pedantry or total academic immersion; ex-
tracurricular activities are vital to the well-
rounded adult colleges should graduate. But
at W&L we need to concentrate now on restor-
ing an atmosphere of excitement in learning.
That excitement, not high grades and not
fraternity parties and not an easy ride
through four more years of school, should be
the Washington and Lee community’s goal.
Now, I simply do not see that excitement as
our highest priority. Joe Ripley
Editorial Note: Many thanks, Mr. Ripley, for
your letter. There is a problem, to be sure, but
with the interest and force of expression that
you — and hopefully others — exhibit, there
will be some necessary changes in orienta-
tion.

Miami Dean To Deliver
Tucker Law Lecture

Soia Mentschikoff, dean of
the University of Miami School
of Law, will deliver the 31st an-
nual John Randolph’ Tucker
Lecture in Law next Saturday
May 12 at Washington and Lee
University.

Ms. Mentschikoff’s topic will
be ‘Decision Making, Decision
Consensus — A _ Normative
Analysis.’’ The lecture, open to
the public, will take place at

11:30 a.m. in the Moot Court
Room in Lewis Hall.

A law graduate of Columbia
University, Ms. Mentschikoff
was admitted to the New York
State bar in 1937 and was
associated with law firms in
New York City from 1937 to
1949. She was associate chief
reporter for the Uniform Com-
mercial Code from 1949 to 1951

and a lecturer at the University
of Chicago from 1951 to 1962.

In 1962 she joined the law
faculty of the University of
Miami, and became dean of the
law school in 1974.

Ms. Mentschikoff’s visit is
scheduled to coincide with spr-
ing reunions for alumni of both
the undergraduate and law divi-
sions at W&L.

Firefall Cancels Concert

the date. You could tell from
their attitude.”’

Evidently, phone negotiations
lasted so long that Firefall
never even received the con-
tract, as revised by Cappeto,
before Saturday the 5th.
“Firefall’s agent never told
them we couldn’t provide 300
amps of electricity... and so,
their manager refused even to
unload the truck. From 11 a.m.
until 2:30, we made all efforts to
‘get a portable generator. And at
2:30, the manager informed us
that — even if we got a
generator — the concert
wouldn’t start until 11 p.m. or
midnight, because of the
delay,”’ said Cappeto. At that
point, even the Firefall
manager recommended
cancellation. Cappeto conclud-
ed, ‘‘The point is, this is no fault
of Firefall or W&L. The pro-
blem was in the home office of
their agents, who never told the
band of our refusal to meet cer-
tain conditions. Had _ they
known, they never would have
agreed to play at all — and we
would have had time to drop

down to somebody less well-
known, and less demanding.
But how far down can you go in
popularity, trying to avoid these
riders, and still retain an au-
dience?

The SAB faces an approx-
imate loss of $1,000 on the pro-
ject, though they are currently
paying nothing to Firefall.

The money allocated for the
concert, some $13,000, will not
be spent until the question of
possible legal action by Firefall
is settled, according to SAB co-
chairman Hank Hall in the
group‘s Monday meeting.

When speaking to the E. C. on
the matter, Hall made a state-

ment that may well turn pro-
phetic: ‘In the future, there
won’t be any large concerts. If
they have them, they won’t be
school sponsored.’’ Cappeto
echoes these sentiments: ‘“The
trend is away from small
schools. We are one of the few
that even try to book major acts
— and I’m not sure we should in
the future, for this is but a
single example of what we con-
tend with in every concert we
book.”

Approximately 650 advance
tickets were sold. Ticket
refunds are available until Fri-
day in the Student Center.

ly as treasurer.

When he became treasurer,
Washington and Lee’s annual
operating budget was
$3,550,687.

This year,
$10,075,646.

Whitehead was educated at
the University of Tampa (Fla.),
where he was director of public
relations for five years. For the
next five years he was national
finance director for the Na-
tional Conference of Christians
and Jews, and from 1955 to 1958
was executive director of the
Empire State Foundation of In-
dependent Liberal Arts Col-
leges in New York, an agency
similar to the 12-member
Virginia Foundation for In-
dependent Colleges, of which
Washington and Lee was a foun-
ding member in 1953.

Almost as soon as he became
treasurer — a year later, in 1967
— Washington and Lee received

characterized by the students
as ‘financial wizard par ex-

king of the blue butterflies and,
most important, friend to every
one of us at Washington and

Dining Hall Changes

Evans Dining Hall will alter
its food service program star-
ting Tuesday due to construc-
tion closing the kitchen, but the
main dining hall will not close.

The expansion program,
which will enlarge the kitchen
but not affect the dining hall
has to start on the 15th so the
project can be completed by
September 1.

Jerry Darrell, director of
university dining and food ser-
vices, said that he plans to use
cooking facilities at VMI and to
cook out on grills frequently,
but students will still eat meals
here.

Darrell said the refrigeration,
drink facilites, and serving
lines will still be available. He
has outlined several programs
to cope with the construction
and the closed kitchen, and says
he hopes students may like the
change from ‘‘the institutional
cooking they've had all year.”’

Hopefully, a grill can be put

Admissions Rise Announced

by Stuart Snyder

“It has been a good year for
admissions,”’ said William H.
Hartog, Director of Admissions.
He added, “This year’s ap-
plicants were as good as last
year’s.”

According to Hartog, the Ad-
missions office does not yet
have any statistical figures on
the in-coming class, but he
estimates that the S.A.T. scores
are about the same as last
year’s students.

“This year there were 1,085
applicants,’ Hartog said. He
added that this is 110 more than
last year, which is an increase
of eleven percent over last
year’s total.

Hartog said his office offered
admissions to 654 applicants as
compared to last year’s 684. So
far 369 have accepted against
394 at this time last year. ‘By

Student Phone-a-thon
Nets $25,000

W & L students, in an annual
telethon for the Annual Fund-
operating budget, raised $25,505
in specific pledges on May 7-9.
The total reflects a significant
increase over the yield of
$19,678 raised last year at this
time.

According to Carter
McNeese, assistant director of
development at W & L, the A-
nual Fund represents 10% or
more of the annual operating
budget, and this year paid about
$570 towards each student’s
education on campus. The
phone-a-thon, begun last year
and chaired again last week by
senior Fred Brimberg,
gathered some 25-30 for 3 nights
of phone calls, soliciting dona-
tions from alumni.

McNeese has called the ac-
tivity a “‘tremendous success
and service to the university.
We definitely plan to continue
the program next year, though
the timing of the Mock Conven-
tion may force us to reschedule
it at a different date.”

“Personally, it is great to
work with these students,’’ he
added. ‘‘Not only funds, but a
great deal of goodwill is
generated as students chat with
alumni. In short, we may see
these students as about the best
‘ambassadors’ W&L has going
at the present time.”’

  
   

university policy,” Hartog said.

The Admissions Office chang-
ed its procedure of notification.
This year it employed a “rolling
admissions policy,’’ in which
notifications start the first of
February and continue until
March, Hartog said.

According to Hartog there
were no changes made in last
year’s new format. ‘‘The only
change was in the topic of the
essay question,’’ said Hartog.

When asked whether the ap-
plicants who took time to fill out
the essay were more willing to
go to Washington and Lee, .
Hartog said,’ ‘I am sure that
the essay has an effect. It
delays some and others do not
get sent atall.”

“Since we are not the first
choice of many who apply, we
want to make it as easy as
possible to apply, but hard for
admission. That way we can br-
ing them here to show them
what we have to offer and
possibly change their minds,”

by David Greer

A Washington and Lee senior
was convicted of an honor viola-
tion Thursday at the first public
honor trial in five years.

A jury consisting of 12
students handed down a guilty
verdict, voting 8 to 4 against the
student, who was tried for
cheating on an exam.

The penalty for committing
an honor infraction is expulsion.

The trial was open only to
members of the W&L communi-
ty, and because the circulation
of the Ring-tum Phi extends
beyond W&L, details of the trial
cannot be revealed here.

Under W&L’s Honor System,
the Student Body Executive
Committee investigates possi-
ble honor infractions and if it
finds that an infraction did oc-
cur, the accused student has a
chance to withdraw from the
university with no mention on
his record of the honor viola-
tion.

Hartog said.

Hartog sees this year’s gain
over last year’s low levels as a
“significant reversal. Especial-
ly, when by 1985 there are sup-
posed to be 23.8 percent fewer
candidates in the nation-wide
applicant pool,” Hartog added.

When asked about the selec-
tion of a candidate who did not
graduate from W&L as ‘Boy
Dean,”’ Hartog said ‘‘the title is
out moded. Since I am not con-
sidered a Dean there really is
no such position.”

“However, the position of
Assistant Director of Admis-
sions has been offered to two
people: Peter Williams and an
undisclosed candidate, whose
name is being withheld until he
notifies the school of his deci-
sion.

Hartog said that the unnamed
person is a graduate of the
University of Alabama with a
B. S. degree. Hartog added,
“‘He is a graduate of the Univer-
sity of Virginia with an M.S. in

“My philosophy about the
position (of Assistant Director
of Admissions) is: it is not a
vested right for a W&L
graduate. I need a proper com-
bination of education,
character, and expertise and if
a W&L graduate happens to fit,
great!” Hartog said.

He added, “I do feel that we
need some recent graduate on
the staff, to keep in touch with
the students.’”’ In Hartog’s opi-
nion next year’s admissions’
staff embodies all of what W&L

Since he feels ‘‘staffing is one
of the most important things,”
he has chosen next year’s staff
for longevity, subjectivity, con-
tinuity and how well it
represents the school. ‘I want
to be able to have them come
back for several years more,”’
he added.

Convicted In Trial

The accused had the aid of
two counsels from the student
body; similarly, the EC used
two of its members to represent
the prosecution.

Bar Association acted as Chair-
man of the proceedings.

Nader Speech Ends Contact’s Year
May 24 Speech To Complete Presentations

Ralph Nader, consumer ad-
vocate and social critic, will
speak at Washington and Lee
Thursday, May 24. The lecture
is sponsored by Contact, the stu-
dent symposium that brings na-
tional and _ internationally
known figures to speak at W&L.

Nader has been called
everything from Muckraker to
Consumer Crusader to Public

Defender. Time magazine call-
ed him “the U.S.’s toughest
customer.”’

An attorney, Nader has
documented criticisms of of the
government and industry that
has resulted in widespread
public awareness and changes
in industry and government to
benefit the American citizen.

The New York Times said of

Nader: ‘‘What sets Nader apart
is that he has moved beyond
social criticism to effective
political action.”” At least six
major federal consumer protec-
tion laws passed in response to
some of his work support this
statement.

Today Nader speaks of the
growing imperialism of
multinational corporations and

the convergence of corporate
and governmental power. A
Contact spokesman said Nader

will probably speak on the cor-
porate power in America and
the workings of economic
governments.

Nader will speak in Lee
Chapel. The lecture is open to
the public without charge, and
will start at 8 p.m.

EC Appointments

by Ross Newell

The Student Body Executive
Committee announced subcom-
mittee appointments for next
year, after reviewing applica-
tions and conducting interviews
last week.

Bill Ridge and David Harpole
were selected from the group of
four applicants for the positions
of Student Activities Board co-
chairmen. Of the two people
who applied for treasurer of the
SAB, the EC appointed Danny
Raskin. Geoffrey Fauth is the
secretary of the SAB next year.
The EC received only one ap-
plication for this position.

SAB appointments are
perhaps the most important to
the student body in general
because theirs is the primary
responsibility for setting the
tone of student entertainment
for next year, especially in
terms of movies and music.

Sidney Simmons, Craig Cor-
nett and Dick Schoenfeld were
chosen as the chairmen of the
1979-1980 Mock Convention.
These positions will undoubted-
ly take on added importance
with the upcoming presidential
election. The EC received no
other applications for these
positions.

Craig Cornett was re-elected
Mock Convention secretary;
there were no other applica-
tions. Jim Hicks was chosen as
the financial computer director
for the Mock Convention next
year. Hicks’ position is basical-
ly that of a treasurer.

The EC appointed Tim
Brooks as chairman of the Stu-
dent Control Committee from
among the three persons who
applied. The SCC handles many
of the student violations of
university rules and regulations
and dispenses disciplinary
penalties for offenses such as
misconduct in the dormatories.

Of the three persons who ap-
plied for chairman of the Cold
Check Committee the EC ap-
pointed Jim Vines. The Cold
Check Committee has nine
other members-at-large and is
responsible for handling the
cases of students who write bad
checks. The nine members-at-

large are: Steve Abraham, Hub
Kennedy, Mike Malesardi,
Geoff Fauth, Wilbur Harville,
Brian Gibson, David Cordell,
Karl Senig, and James Stanton.

The EC appointed Sam Flax,
a law student, and Channing
Hall, a rising junior, as the two
student body representatives to
the Publications Board. Flax
and Hall were the only persons
to apply.

The Publications Board is the
regulatory body for the student
newspaper, the yearbook and
literary magazine. The board
appoints the editors and
business managers of these
publications.

The EC re-appointed Rob
Neely as chairman of the Voting
Regulations Board. The
primary responsibility of the
board is to organize and run stu-
dent elections.

The EC appointed Jose
Amorin and Dan Weiss as the
SAB film co-chairmen from
among the five applicants who
applied. Amorin and Weiss will
be primarily responsible for
scheduling movies for next
year.

Bill Towler and George
Polizos applied for the position
of SAB entertainment director.
The EC, recognizing the talents
of both applicants, voted to
make Towler and Polizos co-
chairmen of SAB _ entertain-
ment. Doug Dorsey is the SAB
publicity director next year.

The EC appointed the follow-
ing persons SAB members-at-
large: Bill Goodell; Diane
Poole, a law student; David Ir-
vin; Stuart Miller; Chester
Taylor; Dave Meyers and
Larry Wescott.

Jamie Small was appointed
chairman of the University
Center Committee. The UCC is
primarily responsible for book-
ing many of the bands in the
Cockpit. Small said that he
hopes to continue the trend of
increasing and improving the
entertainment in the Cockpit.
The members-at-large on the
UCC are: John Pritchett, Mac
McCoy, Guy Stuart and David
Blackwood.

 

SAB applicants await EC appointment decision.

Students Give Drug Opinions
In Newspaper Poll

by David Greer

Over seventy percent of the
student body responding to a re-
cent poll have used marijuana
at least once.

The poll, conducted by Randy
Smith and the Ring-tum Phi,
surveyed freshmen,
sophomores, and juniors. The
poll was conducted in late
March.

According to the poll, 71 per-
cent of all respondents said they
had used marijuana. By class,
70 percent of the freshmen, 76
percent of the sophomores, and
66 percent of the juniors said
they had used marijuana.

The respondents said how
often they used the drug. Of the
freshmen, 18 percent said they
had not used it during the cur-
rent school year; 27 percent
said less that once a month, 19
percent said once a week, and
13 percent said more than three
time a week.

Of the sophomore
respondents, 14 percent had not
used it this year; 14 percent
smoked less than once a month;
18 percent once a week, and 28
percent more than three times a
week.

The junior respondents said
that 16 percent had not used
marijuana this year; 19 percent

The average of all
respondents show that 16 per-
cent had not used marijuana
this school year; 19 percent less
than once a month; 19 percent
once a week; and 16 percent
more than three times a week.

Of the respondents, 59 percent

sion of marijuana. 30 percent
felt there should be penalties.
However, only 37 percent felt
the sale should be legal.

When asked about the use of
cocaine, 25 percent of the

respondents said they had used
coke. By class, 17 percent of the
freshmen, 32 percent of the
sophomores, and 29 percent of
the juniors had used cocaine.
The students polled voted 64
percent in favor of legal
penalties for the use and posses-

sion of the drug and 69 percent

against legalizing the sale of co-
caine.

More than half of the
respondents favor enforced
sanctions against smoking
marijuana in the dorms. 54 per-

enforced sanctions while 33 per-
cent voted against them.

Pate To Join Admissions

Van Haigler Pate, director of
financial aid at Washington and
Lee University for the past six
years and assistant admissions
director for the two years prior
to that, will become .associate
admissions director this sum-

In the first five seconds you
know Manhattan is different
because the expected
technicolor is not there — the
film is shot instead in a
beautifully muted black-and
white. The first minutes of the
film are a tribute to New York
City: a long series of shots at
street level, skyline views, and
a climactic scene of nighttime
fireworks over the Hudson. The
explosions burst in time with
the crecendos of the Gershwin
soundtrack, making this a
strong opening scene.

But this is just a prelude, the
overture to a film about the life
and loves of a writer. Isaac
(Allen), the writer, is currently
dating a 17-year old girl (Mariel
Hemingway). His best friend
(Michael Murphy) is dating a
screwy author (Diane Keaton).

Performances
Begin At
Theatre

Beginning next week, the
Total Theater crew will present
the fruit of their labors in the
Troubadour Theatre. There will
be a wide range of presenta-
tions, from one-man shows to
original films to a full-length
comedy production.

Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. three
one-act plays written by
Washington and Lee student
James Leva will be performed.
Thursday’s one-man shows in-
clude performances based on
Shakespearean fools, tragic
characters, Brecht’s ‘Jewish
Wife” and Charles Manson.
They begin at 7:00.

The films are to be screened
May 26, 27 and 28, beginning at
7:00. The full-length comedy
production, What the Butler
Saw is scheduled for per-
formances on May 29, 30 and 31
in the Boiler Room Theater. All
performances are open to the
public and free at charge.

Cool Breeze Featured
Tonight In Cockpit

Tonight, the featured band in
the Cockpit will be Cool Breeze,
from down Hotlanta way, and

these guys are as hot as the.

town. Following on the footsteps
of their friends, the
Nighthawks, tonight’s show
promises to be a winner in
every respect.

Cool Breeze specializes in a
rhythm and blues-oriented ap-
proach to old soul standards,
newer tunes, and original songs
that recall an earlier day in the
genre: when the back beat was
consistent, the guitars would
wail, the singer would sing his
guts out: all that made the blues
and R&B good before it was af-
fected by the predictability of
much disco music today.

Who is Cool Breeze? Vocalist
Bill Sheffield was a member of
Roy Buchanan’s band, and was
on his In The Beginning album.
Rick Kicklighter and Hal Berry
are two tough, sweet, and at the

same time, melodious players.

Bassist Hassan Khan manned
his instrument with the Staple
Singers. John Healy tinkles the
ivory, once a member of the
Band of Desperate Men, and
Tommy Kennedy is the drum-
mer.

The music is modern soul in
that it combines all the great
chops of standard R&B, as well
as newer jazz riffs and phras-
ings very much akin to Benson,
and others.

There will be a cover charge
of $1.00 for all W&L students,
and the show will begin at 8:00.
All fraternity social charimen

are invited guests of Steve
Loehrer, their manager, and
these chairmen can talk to him
about possible rush dates in the
fall.

Next Tuesday, Skip Castro br-
ings his band back to the
Cockpit for their last show of
the year. There will be no
charge for this event, and show
time is at 8:00.

Manhattan: A Woody Allen Triumph

Allen falls in love with Keaton;
Murphy doesn’t know it. The
characters’ confusion mounts,
but the story stays intelligible
and interesting. At its most
complicated moments, the film
maintains its clarity with the
help of Allen’s carefully worded
script, which reveals details lit-
tle by little.

The cinematography in
Manhattan is unique, largely
reminiscent of French and
Swedish films of the late 50’s
and early 60’s. There is a three-
dimensional quality in the
smooth, often static camera,
which allows the viewer to
thoroughly inspect the details of
a given scene.

Allen’s choice of Gershwin
music for a score is especailly
appealing in this film. The sen-
timental moods of the music

combined with the crisp black-
and-white of the photography
remind us of the New York of
the glitter days — when the city
was Safe and romantic.

Every character, from
stereo-typed bit parts to lead
roles, is well cast and suitably
portrayed. Keaton is still the
flighty Annie Hall type, but she
deepens the character and
comes out of it with more
credibility.

Woody Allen’s Manhattan is
everything good we could hope
for in a film. Together in one
show, we see the usual Allen
humor, slicked up and refined,
effective drama, fantastic
cinematography, brilliant ac-
ting, and a great setting. No
doubt about it Manhattan pro-
ves Woody Allen as one of the
great minds in American film.

Commentary :

 

NCAA Must Improve

Tournament System

by Bill Whalen

On Sunday, May 13, the NCAA Division I Lacrosse Tournament
bids were announced and for the first time since 1971, the
Washington and Lee Generals were not one of the eight designated
temas. Not only does this end a seven year streak of tournament
play, but it is notable that the Generals’ streak should end this year.
In 1979, there seemed to be a shift in power in NCAA Lacrosse.

To understand why the Generals did not make the final eight, it is
necessary to look at the way the lacrosse rankings have gone this
year.

The top five positions have been solidly occupied by the same
teams all year long. Johns Hopkins and Maryland have controlled
the first and second slots, while Cornell (until the latest rankings)
has been third. Meanwhile, Navy and Virginia have traded off
fourth and fifth place. The rest of the top ten has been as predic-
table as a horse race. This is all very interesting, but what does this
have to do with W&L?

Basically, this. With five teams cemented in the top five slots,
five out of the eight available bids are already taken. This leaves a
mad scramble for the last three openings. This year, seven teams
— W&L, Syracuse, N. C. State, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Ar-
my and Rutgers — could all raise a legitimate claim for one of the
three spots. Simple arithmetic tells us that four teams will not be
included in the playoffs. And in 1979, fate caught up with the
Generals.

But why weren’t the Generals selected? Instead of answering
this, it is easier to look at the three teams that played yesterday:

No. 6 Massachusetts — U Mass was the darkhorse of the race,
and is the most controversial selection. Three wins in ten days over
Harvard, Army and Syracuse gave U Mass enough mementum to
sneak in. However, Massachusetts also lost to three teams —
Rutgers, Brown and Hofstra — that W&L beat. Against four com-
mon opponents, U Mass went 1-3 while W&L went 3-1.

No. 7 Syracuse — There is no room for debate with this selection,
because in head to head competition, Syracuse beat the Generals
10-7. The Orangemen have played six teams that have been ranked
in the top ten, with five of these games being away from home.

No. 8 N.C. State — The Wolfpack was also an expected selection.
N. C. State guaranteed a bid by doing four things this year: (1)
beating North Carolina in their final game (2) losing to Maryland
by only one goal (3) not playing a game since April 28 (the earliest
finish of all tournament teams) (4) not playing W&L this year (it
would have been N. C. State’s turn to play in Lexington this year).
State does have a good team, but how can you believe in a team that
plays competition like Hampden-Sydney?

 

With more Division I teams rebuilding once weak programs and
stronger competition in Divisions II and III, it is becoming harder
to get into the tournament. In the 1977 tournament, six of the eight
teams were repeaters from the year before. In 1979, only five of the
eight teams were in the 1978 playoffs. Eventually, only three or four
teams will be able to consistently make the tourney — and one of
the teams to be hurt by this trend will be W&L. Only the programs
with the most money will get the best results. Teams with limited
financial and scholarship funds — like W&L — will find it more dif-
ficult to stay competitive with the ‘super schools.”’ To help the
smaller schools, the NCAA should change their current standards
for tournament-selecting.

Generals Dump Hofstra;

by Doug Linton

The Generals closed out their
season on a positive note as they
downed the Flying Dutchmen
from Hofstra by a final score of
12-9. John Kemp scored five
goals to lead the attack as the
stickmen added this final game
to their win column to finish the
year at a 9-4 mark.

A 1500-plus crowd saw the
nets dented twice in the early
going. Kemp opened the scoring
for W&L only 20 seconds into the
game, capitalizing on an extra-
man _ situation. But Hofstra
responded only 16 seconds later
to tie the contest.

It looked like the start of a
wide-open offensive duel, but to
everyone’s surprise the quarter
ended at 1-1. By the time the
next period was over, however,
there was no question as to
which team was the dominant

Hofstra then got their second
goal, but Kemp bounced back
with another. The Dutchmen
found the net next, but this only
sparked another three goal
surge by the Generals. Geoff
Brent scored, followed by Kemp
again and after Fritz fed Black,
the Generals had a six goal
lead. Hofstra squeezed one
more in before halftime, but
they went to the locker room
trailing 9-4.

W&L was content to sit on its
lead in the third quarter and
merely stay even with the Dut-
chmen, as each team scored
three times. The Generals then
got what proved to be their last
tallies of the day. Fritz scored
his second, which proved to be

the game. Hofstra got two more
goals in the final quarter, but it
was not enough to make up for
the excellent play which the
Generals had exhibited earlier
in the contest. The 12-9 score
marks only the third time that
W&L has defeated Hofstra in 18
outings.

Although the offense was
perking, it was a total team ef-
fort that iced the victory. Bob
Clements was again superb in
the crease and added 22 saves to
his total, giving him 225 stops on
the year. For his efforts,
Clements shared the Cannon
Award with Kemp.

the most part and has been

Black Leads
In Scoring

John Black led the scoring for
the year with 29 goals and 14
assists. (Rob Staugaitis led in
the assist department with 16.)
Jeff Fritz and John Kemp each
had 25 goals, while Jay Foster
had 18. The key to the Generals’
success (although they received
no NCAA bid) this season had to
be the fact that the scoring was
so spread around the offense,

along with a strong defensive
unit behind the attack.

Next Year
Looks Good

The W&L stickmen should be
at least as successful next
season, as a strong nucleus of
returning lettermen will be
looking to do some damage to
their opposition in Division I.

| Lax Team Will Be |

Weakened By Trend

(continued from page 4)

At the moment, the NCAA is playing the ‘‘Three Monkeys” game
with this problem. What the NCAA must realize is that its current
system of selecting is too arbitrary. The NCAA should take one of
the following steps:

(A) Develop a point system whereby a team earns points for
playing an opponent. A team would be given points according to the
ranking of the opponent, the performance against that team and
the site of the game. This would discourage a lot of pushover games
and would give a judging committee an equal standard.

(B) Expand the playoff field from eight teams to ten. Give the top
six teams first round byes and let the other four teams play in a
wild-card round. No. 7 would play at home against No. 10 while No.
8 would entertain No. 9. The two winners would then play in the
quarterfinal round, with the winner of No. 7 vs. No. 10 playing the
No. 2 team while the winner of No. 8 vs. No. 9 would play the top-
seeded team. This would give two more teams a chance to make the
playoffs. This year, five of the seven teams would have played.

Hopefully, the NCAA will take some action before lacrlacrosse,
like football and basketball, becomes a sport for only the biggest
and the richest.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

On Thursday’s

Perhaps no single event has been more difficult for
this writer to comment upon than the public honor
trial held on campus last Thursday. Above all, it was
a novel experience for the student body, who turned
out in numbers of 600-800 to witness the first public
hearing of their college careers. Few faculty faces
were in evidence; many teachers felt that even this
phase of the Honor System should proceed without
staff participation. Even so, a large number of Thurs-
day classes were cancelled to give students the op-
portunity to witness the entire procedure. Due to the
increasing rarity of public trials, we thank the faculty
(or some of them at least) for giving the student body
a chance to see their Honor System in action.

Moving to what occurred inside the Chapel, thanks
are also due to many people. Picked at random and
with few hours of notice, the jury members blended
patient, open minds with a repeated willingness to ask
questions overlooked by both prosecution and
defense. Considerable research and attention marked
both sides’ presentations, again carried out by law
students and undergraduates. And most of all, we
would like to praise the way in which Kevin Cosgrove,
Student Bar Association President and chairman of
the trial, kept heads cool and the audience at ease in
the crowded, stuffy chapel.

There was considerable concern before the trial
‘hat a ‘‘circus atmosphere’’ would prevail, due to the
1ather unique nature of the event. But the audience
remained largely silent throughout the seven-hour
trial. Opinions on the case itself may have differed
from observer to observer, but one impression was
fairly universal: W&L’s most recent honor trial was
both impressive and fair. The participants showed a
true interest in getting at the facts of the case without
loud words or excess emotion. And the result —
regardless of the verdict — was definite proof that
W&L students continue to hold the Honor System in
the highest esteem. Unpleasant as such trials are,
they remain a great learning experience. To one, to
all, our sincerest appreciation for the objective in-

terest that was displayed last week.

Letters To The Editor

Mr. Gray Coleman
Editor, Ring-tum Phi
Dear Gray,

I want to thank you and your associates for
the distinguished honor you bestowed upon
me and the library two weeks ago with the
Ring Tum Phi award. It is an award which is

highly valued.

The achievements of The Great Move and
the happiness with the new library were
possible because all aspects of the campus
joined together to develop these programs.
One of the most important participants from
the beginning has been the Ring Tum Phi.

To you, your associates and to your
predecessors I am most appreciative of your
interest and support for the emergence of a

strong ‘‘heart of the campus.”’

Maurice D. Leach, Jr.

Dear Editor,

Within the past two weeks, two W&L seniors
have been dismissed from school — with less
than a month until graduation. They were
both found guilty of honor violations — of
cheating on exams. The question we must ask
here is: Why has such a thing happened? And
is this kind of activity typical or atypical?
Because if it is typical, and not atypical as
many seem to believe, then we must be very

when I ask this question, remember that one
reason for so doing is to help bring into focus
the sad state of education in the city of Lex-
ington. What I wish to emphasize is the
alienation of the student from the text, and
from the very core of what should be the
center of his study, himself.

I would like to ask this of the professors and
instructors who believe in a tradition of
teaching that gives rise to ‘cold test”’ files in
fraternities and to the estrangement of the
student who believes that by mastering
several years of these tests that he is
somehow doing something useful with his
time: What is your job? If it is to breed in the
student a habit of collusion and covert prac-
tices that help him to pass a test, which in
turn will enable him to ‘‘make it”’ in the rat
race of the marketplace, then so be it. But, is
this really your job?

Sincerely,

Librarian Michael Odom

The Washington and Lee student body is to
be complimented on its behavior at Satur-
day’s lacrosse game. The crowd on the whole
was well-mannered and the cheering was loud

an obnoxious drunk who stategically placed
himself in front of the faculty box, was not a
member of the W&L community, and the
community did not condone his actions.

The Ring-tum Phi
Dear Mr. Coleman:

The enclosed letter expresses my feel-
ings, as well as those of many concerned
parents, about the existing fraternity
system at W&L. During this whole year, I
have felt that the Ring-tum Phi needed a
parent’s point of view, and belatedly I am
carrying out the dictates of my conscience.

I want to commend you, and your fine
staff, on publishing an excellent college
newspaper this year. You have set high
standards for future editors and staffs to
follow, and your journalistic reporting on
all phases of W&L activities, has never
been more excellent. The Ring-tum Phi is
the principal voice of information for
parents and alumni, and I know I express
the appreciation of all for keeping us so
well-informed.

Good luck in all your future endeavors. ©

A CONCERNED PARENT

Dear Editor:

For quite some time I have wanted to
write concerning the overall fraternity
system at Washington and Lee. The inten-
sive Ring-tum Phi coverage in the past
several issues on problems relating to
fraternity social and residential behavior
has shown good journalistic reporting. The
faculty, Administration, and fraternities
should, however, in all honesty, examine
the overall fraternity system.

In the September 14 Ring-tum Phi, the
Interfraternity Council reported that 393
students registered for fall rush, a number

given in the December Ring-tum Phi by
Professor Frederic L. Schwab. For the
first time, a faculty member bravely
spoke out. Professor Schwab, in compar-
ing the two fraternity systems of W&L and
Dartmouth, explained general policies at
Dartmouth which I, and many concerned
parents, feel should be initiated at W&L.

The first major point he mentioned was
deferred rush. No college in the United
States needs to have deferred rush more
than W&L. With the exisiting system at
W&L, fraternity rush benefits fraternities,
only. For the incoming freshman, the tran-
sition to college life can be traumatic. Con-
ducting rush in late fall, or during the
winter term would allow the freshman to
beoome acclimated to the college
academic program, and would allow both
students and fraternity members the op-
portunity to get to know one another bet-
ter. As Professor Schwab stated, with
deferred rush, ‘“‘The bulk of the freshman
year is for acclimatization, and for
academics. Fraternity life takes the pro-
per back seat.’’ Under the present system,
unless the rushee is from a city where
there are W&L fraternity members, he has
no conception of, or preparation for rush.
The letters written from active fraternity
members during the summer really give
little information about rush. There is no
information sent to the incoming freshman
from W&L, and the Catalogue devotes less
than one-half page to the subject. The
freshman is also totally unaware that the
location of his room, and whether or not his
dorm counselor is a fraternity member,
can be determining factors in his receiving
a fraternity bid or not.

 

“...if over 90% of the W&L freshman class want

to be in a fraternity, then certainly close to that

number should be extended an invitation...”

 

representing ninety-nine per cent of the:

freshman class. The October 12 issue
stated that over half of the freshman class
pledged fraternities. These statistics do
tell the sad story. What happened to the
forty-nine percent of the freshmen who did
not get a bid?

For years the fraternities, the Ad-
ministration, and the faculty have ignored
the fact that far more boys each year want
to affiliate with a fraternity than are given
the opportunity. The total social structure
at W & L centers around the fraternities,
and those boys who deserve a bid, but are
not given the opportunity to pledge, feel, in
fact, that they are social outcasts. The hurt
is very real, and the scar of rejection re-
mains forever. The Independent Union is
an organization in name only, and has
never functioned as a meaningful
substitute for fraternities. Even the W & L
Catalogue states that “*. . . a large portion
of the social life at Washington and Lee
centers around the fraternity chapters.”’

As a member of a national Greek frater-
nity, I have happy memories of my active
fraternity days, and I do feel that there is a
place for fraternities within an
undergraduate, liberal arts educational in-
stitution. I am well aware of the decline of
the fraternity system on all campuses in
the ‘60’s, and the fact that several frater-
nities on the W&L campus folded. I strong-
ly believe, however, that if over ninety per
cent of the W&L freshman class want to be
in a fraternity, then certainly close to that
number should be extended an invitation
to join a fraternity.

For years the Administration has not ad-
dressed itself to the deteriorating fraterni-
ty state of affairs. The Administration and
faculty should have realized years ago that
more fraternities were needed again on
campus, and that existing fraternities
should be pledging more boys during rush.
The first encouraging ray of light was

One of the rebuttals by fraternities to
deferred rush is that houses need the
money from freshmen to operate. If defer-
red rush were instigated, freshmen could
still pay the same amount of dues for their
pledgeship period, and active dues could
be regulated within that time frame. There
are several solutions to this problem, and
the situation would entail adjustment only
during the initial change to deferred rush.

The other aspect of the W&L fraternity
system, which is the most immature prac-
tice of all, is the ‘‘one-man” or “‘two-men”’
blackball system. As Professor Schwab
stated, ‘‘No fraternity at Dartmouth
tolerates the studipity of the blackball
whereby one or two individuals can impose
their bigotry or ignorance on 60 other peo-

Parent Addresses Fraternity Question

ple.’”” Any mature person would concur
with this statement. With the selective
screening process involved in the accep-
tance of prospective students at W&L,
there should be relatively few boys who
are not “fraternity material.’’ Certainly, a
sad state of affairs exists when a fine
young man, who has excelled in prep
school, or public high school, is turned
down by the fraternity of his choice
because one or two actives do not “know
him well enough.’’ One of the major
strengths of fraternities on all campuses
has depended for years on the recommen-
dations and support of its fraternity alum-
ni. How very tragic for the rushee when

membership at this point in time? How
kind it would be for fraternities to review
the list of boys who were extremely in-
terested in them, and, where humanly
possible, extend bids now, or at the beginn-
ing of next year to any ‘“‘worthy’’ incoming
sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Why not
let these ‘‘worthy’’ young men take the
place of fraternity members transferring
this year, or those who have already left?
It would be interesting to evaluate the
results of a survey given to independents
concerning various aspects of the existing
W&L fraternity system.

Washington and Lee is coasting along on
its past glories and reputation. The Ad-

 

“Another outrageous fraternity practice...

The use of two colors of ink on rushees’ name tags

to designate whether the boy

is from the north or south.”

 

the fraternity refuses to consider strong
recommendations by alumni, and or facul-
ty advisors. The most distressing situation
of all at W&L is when a fraternity does not
give the utmost consideration to a rushee
who is a legacy, or has strong fraternity
ties. Another outrageous fraternity prac-
tice employed by at least one fraternity is
the use of two colors of ink on rushees’
name tags to designate whether the boy is
from the north or south.

Professor Schwab also mentioned other
practices that could benefit the W&L
fraternity system. He stated that ‘‘No
fraternity at Dartmouth is allowed to
maintain a dining room. . . This rule
discourages fraternity members from
total immersion within a miniature society
of ‘like-thinking brothers’ and forces them
to maintain contact with, and an
allegiance to, the larger college communi-
ty.’’ He also mentioned that the most ac-
tive members at Dartmouth are the
seniors who produce more mature leader-
ship within individual fraternities.

The time has come when the total frater-
nity system must be examined at W&L.
Weekday parties and hazing are only one
small part of the whole problem. If frater-
nities really want to be an instrument for
good, both to the members and the com-
munity,then great soul-searching should
take place. In what way could the frater-
nities substitute hazing for community im-
provements — require physical work in
helping landscape some of the parks and
downtown areas, and maintain various
segments of the college campus? What

ministration, Board of Trustees, and
Alumni Directors should be very concern-
ed about the many problems that are being
carefully “‘buried’’ at W&L. Significant
facts should be considered, such as the
high percentage of dissatisfied students
transferring at the end of this year, and the
dramatic decrease in student applications
for the school year 1978-79.

I greatly admire Professor Schwab for
being the first faculty member to express
concern about the total fraternity system
at W&L. And now, it is my hope that this
letter, expressing the views of many con-
cerned parents, will cause the University
to examine and remedy some of its major
problems.

A CONCERNED PARENT SPEAKS
OUT...

We would like to thank the Concerned
Parent who wrote the very thoughtful Let-
ter to the Editor this week. We encourage
letters from parents, alumni, all members
of the W&L community, and our Lex-
ington readers. However, there are some
problems with this letter. Perhaps we as
students and fraternity members can
clear up some misconceptions expressed
in the letter.

The Concerned Parent wants to know
‘what happened to the 49 percent of the
freshmen who did not get a bid.’”’ The 49
percent in question did not pledge frater-
nities when preference cards were turned
in at the end of Rush. Among this group
were those who joined fraternities later,
those who found they could not afford
fraternity expenses, those who never in-
tended to join a fraternity in the first place
but who wanted to participate in the par-
ties and meet the rest of the student body
and those who received bids but not from
their favorite house. Many freshmen are
just as selective as many fraternites are —
some do not want to join just any house,
just as some fraternities will not bid just
any freshman.

The fraternities are no longer the sole
source of social livelihood in Lexington,
contrary to a statement in the letter. The
options have increased tremendously
since we've been here, especially in the ex-
panded entertainment programs in the
Cockpit. The demise of the Independent’s
Union shows that the independents do not
have a strong enough desire for such a

body to organize in force; the option was
there, but despite strong efforts by a few
the independents did not rally to the cause.

The Concerned Parent repeatedly refers

to Dr. Schwab’s letter of last winter about
the fraternity system at Dartmouth during
his stay there. While a well-written and
thoughtful piece about another fraternity
system, it compared Dartmouth of the late
1950’s to W&L of the mid-1970’s, not ac-

(continued on page 8)
Page 8, The Ring-tum Phi, May 17, 1979

More On The Fraternities At W&L

(continued from page 7)
counting for changing national trends and
failing to mention the present state of
Dartmouth's fraternity system — the
faculty vote to ban fraternities speaks well
enough on that point.

The Concerned Parent advocates defer-
red rush. Deferred rush does occur at
W&L; perhaps the author is advocating
conducting Rush later in the year. The ear-
ly Rush here serves as an orientation for
the freshmen, necessary because the
social structure at W&L is unique and
because this is such a tight-knit communi-
ty. Saying ‘fraternity rush benefits frater-
nities only’’ is a totally irresponsible state-
ment, as is saying a freshman’s dorm
room location and fraternal status of his
dorm councilor are determining factors of
the freshman’s chances during Rush. With
our early Rush, the freshman meets near-
ly half of the upperclassmen and learns
much of how the social system here works
— how to get dates, how to ‘go down the
road,’ and what-not. We cannot agree
more with the statement that ‘transition
into college life can be traumatic” and at

EC Holds Shortest Meeting

WAL the potential for trauma is heighten-
ed by this being a single-sex school,
isolated from female students, and the all-
freshman dormitories. ‘‘Learning the
ropes’’ early in the year helps the
freshman adjust to the climate he will ex-
perience for four more years. There might
not be enough freshmen left for a late rush
if it weren't for the early system.

The Concerned Parent complains about
the one- and two-ball system used in the
fraternities’ selection process. Those not
familiar with the process do not realize
that although a member has the right to
vote against the entire house, fraternal
respect and peer pressure play a strong
enough role that it will be a rare case when
one member balls a freshman against the
wishes of the entire house. Even when one
or two members do not know a freshman,
they will not ball him on this point; they
will respect the recommendations of the
other members.

The Concerned Parent finds it distress-
ing when “‘legacies’’ are not bid. The
Parent should keep in mind that frater-
nites change in the forty years that elapse

between their fraternity days and the pre-
sent; a house can undergo radical changes
in that time. We would even venture to
guess that many parents would not want
their son to join their old fraternity if they
could see them today. Recommendations
and lists of achievements are considered,
but they do not put a freshman on
automatic bid status. The fraternities are
more interested in the individual and his
own merits, not what his uncle in Arizona,
who knows the secret handshake,
thinks about him. As for strong fraternity
ties, every student who has visited other
schools knows that chapters vary im-
mensely from campus to campus; alumni
can attest to changes in the chapters as the
years pass.

Late bidding does occur here at
Washington and Lee. Bids are extended
throughout the year in some cases, and
sometimes freshmen choose to take their
bids late in the year. Others change frater-
nities in the middle of the year. Recom-
mendations from freshmen already pledg-
ed are also frequently considered. So you
see, Rush is not over on October 1; the

doors are not shut to qualified freshmen. A
student can choose to go through Rush
again if he likes. Also, the Concerned
Parent should himself consider the
“significant facts’? about admissions; a
story on page one of this newspaper tells of
an 1! percent increase in applications
returned over last year.

The issues raised by the Concerned
Parent are legitimate ones, but often seen
only on the surface or as related by
discouraged freshmen. Proper understan-
ding of the fraternity system is the first
and most necessary step in solving the pro-
blems that surround the fraternity system
at Washington and Lee; we only wish there
were more observers who would express
their concerns and opinions and allow pro-
blems to be aired. This last comment is
directed not only at parents and alumni,
who do not have a first-hand view of what
occurs in our fraternities, but to those in
the W&L community who think they know
the solutions to fraternity problems
without even educating themselves on the
workings of the system itself.

118 To Receive Degrees
In Law Graduation

Separate Ceremony Set For.Sunday

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s School of Law will award
118 juris doctor degrees during
special commencement exer-
cises this Sunday, May 27, at
4:30 p.m. on the university cam-
pus.

Ariel To Arrive June l

Thirty-two pages of prose and
poetry fill the spring issue of
Ariel, Washington and Lee’s
student literary magazine.
which will be available in the
bookstore June Ist.

According to editor Ben
Keesee the content of this issue
is the best offered to W&L
students in quite a while. The
issue contains no photographs
to allow maximum space for
‘literary’ material.

Asked about the late date of
distribution ‘Keesee replied,
“Well, although printing and
other problems did delay
publication a bit, it was my in-
tention to delay publication as
long as possible in order to in-
clude the best possible
material. We certainly didn’t
intend to leave law students out
in the cold, though, and steps
are being taken to insure that
any law student who wants a
copy of the second issue gets
one.”

The law students’ term ends
and graduation will be held
before the distribution date.
Graduating law students can
have copies mailed to them by
signing a request sheet at the

circulation desk of the law
library. A number of copies will
be reserved for distribution to
law students next fall.

Keesee said his biggest pro-
blem with the second issue was
deciding which pieces to leave
out. ‘‘The response in contribu-
tions for the second issue was
really terrific. We could have
easily run 42 pages of copy plus
pictures if the budget had per-
mitted,’’ he said. He added that
efforts to include as much
material as possible may give a

magazine in some spots.

There will be no color cover
on this issue as there was in the
fall. Keesee said although the
color cover played a big part in
the success of the first issue,
funds were limited and he felt it
best to print as much copy as
possible.

He attributed the general suc-
cess of Arielthis year to the sup-
port of the Executive Commit-
tee, Parker Potter, the Ariel
staff and contributors.

Interested members of the
public are invited to attend the

ceremony — which will take
place under the trees in front of
Robert E. Lee’s home, weather
permitting. (If it should rain,
the ceremony will take place in
Lee Chapel. )

Washington and Lee’s
undergraduate commencement
will take place June 7. The
reason for the earlier law
graduation this year — which is
a departure from custom — is
the difference in the academic
calendars between the law
school and the undergraduate
divisions. (The law school re-

Besides, there were no wind-

It was a bulldozer, parked in

Murph said that three people
wearing fatigues drove the
bulldozer from behind the
ROTC building at about 3:15
a.m. Wednesday. They ap-
parently abandoned the vehicle
in front of the student center
when they saw an approaching

police car.

Murph said whoever took the
bulldozer obviously knew how
to drive one. He also said the the
culprits took the keys to the
bulldozer, and the keys they
took are the only set the con-
struction company has here in
Lexington.

The company does not plan to
prosecute, Murph said, as long
as the keys are returned. The
bulldozer had to be hot-wired to
be returned to the construction
site.

The speaker at Sunday’s law

principal address at all gradua-
tion ceremonies.

A reception for the law
graduates, their family and
guests, faculty and alumni, will

Who Will The Convention Pick In 1980?

 

 

Reagan, Connally, Baker Are Among The Faces In Cluttered GOP Field

Ronald Reagan

by Ed Taylor

Despite the fact he’d be near-
ly 70 when he took office in the
White House, a recent Time
magazine poll shows Ronald
Reagan as the front-runner for
the 1980 Republican presiden-
tial nomination.

The former governor of
California and onetime liberal
Democrat turned conservative
Republican looms as the early
GOP favorite to assume the
presidency in 1980. In the latest
Gallup Poll of Republican
voters, Reagan led with 31 per-
cent followed by former Presi-
dent Gerald Ford with 26 per-
cent. Former Texas Governor
John Connally was third with 12
of the votes pursued by Senator
Howard Baker of Tennessee
with 8 percent.

However, should Ford choose
not to run — and he has made an
inclination toward this — then
Reagan’s lead jumps to 43 per-
cent followed by Connally with
16 percent.

These early patterns are a far
cry from the 1976 race for the
candidacy when Reagan
started slowly, then came on
strong only to narrowly lose to
the incumbent President Ford.
Had he defeated Ford, Reagan
then would have been the first
candidate in 92 years to take the
nomination away from an in-
cumbent president.

Ronald Reagan was born on
February 6, 1911 in Tampico,
Ill. As a child he became fond of
acting and later attended
Eureka College, a small Chris-
tian Church School near Peoria.
He graduated in 1932 and took a
sports announcing job in Des
Moines, Iowa at WHO, where he
became known as ‘Dutch’
Reagan.

While covering the Chicago
Cubs at spring training in
California, he was asked to take
a screen test and from this his
movie career began. He starred
in such films as ‘Knute

 

Rockne—All American’’ and
“King’s Row.” Although he
didn’t win any Academy
Awards, Reagan utilized his ac-
ting career to sharpen a stage
presence that became a
tremendous asset for him in
politics.

During his acting career,
Reagan was a liberal Democrat
but he later gained fame as an
energetic spokesman proclaim-
ing opposition to centralized
government and support for a
hard-nosed stance by the United
States in foreign affairs. He
strongly supported the free-
enterprise system and
vigorously opposed big govern-
ment.

In 1966, persuaded by friends
from the movie _ industry,
Reagan ran for governor of
California. He was not given
much chance in the race, but
when the votes were tallied he
had swamped incumbent
Democrat Edmund G. Brown
by nearly 845,000 votes.

To put to rest the belief that
his election was a fluke, Reagan
won re-election in 1970 by near-
ly 500,000 votes.

Reagan left the governor’s of-
fice in 1974 and in addition to his
unsuccessful presidential cam-
paign in 1976 he has prospered
as a lecturer, radio commen-
tator and syndicated columnist.
He .now lives in Pacific
Palisades, California with his
wife, Nancy. They have two
children; a daughter, Patricia,
26, anda son, Ronald, 20.

As a front-runner in the 1980
Republican’ presidential
nomination Reagan’s
strategists feel he must start off
winning or he will quickly fade
from the _ public’s favor.
Therefore, a few early primary
victories seem to be a necessity
for Reagan if he expects to win
the Republican nomination at
the 1980 convention in Detroit.

As for the age issue, one sup-
porter said ‘If we win a few
early primaries, it’ll disappear.
If we lose a few, it'll kill us.”’

John Connally

by Craig Cornett

Although he became a
Republican only six years ago,
former Texas governor John B.
Connally is now running hard
for his party’s presidential
nomination and early polls
show him to be a strong con-
tender. The 61-year-old Houston
lawyer became the fourth
declared candidate for the GOP
nomination on January 23 and
has been drawing overflow
crowds on speaking tours ever
since.

Known for a certain self-
confidence and swashbuckling
style, Connally took his lessons
in politics from his mentor:
Lyndon B. Johnson, whom Con-
nally served as a congressional
aide, campaign manager, and
Secretary of the Navy. More
recently, Connally served
President Richard Nixon as
Treasury Secretary for 16
months and later as chairman
of ‘Democrats for Nixon’’ in
the 1972 presidential election.

A staunch political conser-
vative, Connally offers himself
to the nation and his adopted

party as the healer for what he
calls a ‘‘major period of crisis
in our history.’’ He supports a
constitutional amendment for a
balanced budget, eased en-
vironmental controls, incen-
tives for energy production, and
more leeway for the CIA and
FBI.

Connally’s association with
Nixon promises to haunt him
during the campaign, but he
brushes aside criticism by say-
ing: ‘‘My relations with him
(Nixon) were decent and
honest. I served not him, but the
nation. I have no apologies to
make for serving in the Nixon
Administration.”” But heavy
criticism abounds. Sen. George

“McGovern (D-S.D.), the man
Nixon defeated in 1972, has a
more caustic tone. ‘‘I wouldn’t
trust Connally within a mile of
the White House,’’ McGovern
has said. ‘‘John Connally com-
bines the worst of both
Watergate and Vietnam. He’s
the perfect symbol of the
double-talking, double-crossing
politician. He doesn’t even
know what party he belongs
t6.”’

Many of McGovern’s
statements stem from Connal-
ly’s 1975 trial on charges that he
accepted -two $5,000 payoffs
from dairy industry producers
for supporting a price increase
while he was Secretary of the
Treasury. Connally was acquit-
ted on all charges.

While Connally has done
remarkably well in campaign
trips since his announcement,
his home state of Texas could

Howard
Baker

by Norman Ball

Tennessee Senator Howard
Baker all but formally announc-
ed his bid for the 1980
Republican ' presidential
nomination in a TV appearance
May 6. Responding to inquiries
about his possible candidacy on
“Face the Nation,’ Baker
replied, ““You know I am a can-
didate...I’m running hard, I
have a good organization and I
plan to win.”’

This announcement by the 55-
year-old Senate Minority
Leader casts him into an
already cluttered field of GOP
presidential hopefuls, among
them John Connally, George
Bush, Philip Crane, Bob Dole
and, although he has yet to
declare his candidacy, Ronald
Reagan. In recent polls, though,
Baker has emerged reasonably
well, often placing behind
Reagan, Ford and Connally as
the most desirable Republican
presidential candidate.

No stranger to Washington,
Baker first served as a Senator
in 1966, winning handily over
longtime Tennessee governor
Frank Clement. In 1972, he won
re-election with an impressive
62% of the vote, carrying all
eight of the state’s congres-
sional districts, and his ’78 elec-
tion was equally decisive.
Baker’s struggle to grasp
Senate Minority Leader was
just that. He managed to pull
one more vote than Robert Grif-
fin, his opponent in a heated
contest. Baker had tried for the
position two times before
without success.

The Senator first received na-
tional exposure as the ranking
Republican on the Senate
Watergate Committee, and his
name was brought up frequent-
ly as Ford’s most probable run-
ning mate on the ’76 GOP ticket
(although, of course, Robert
Dole was eventually chosen).
Later on this year when Con-
gress considers SALT II,
Baker’s positions on _ the
Foreign Relations Committee
and the Arms Control Subcom-
mittee will offer him added na-
tional recognition.

Ideologically, Baker is hard
to define. He has opposed many
of the traditionally held conser-
vative views during his career,
his most recent defection being
support of the Panama Canal
Treaties — a position which
many Republicans claim will
seriously damage his nomina-
tion chances. During the great

Theatre Brings Hot

Comedy To Boiler Room

by Ben Keesee

A comedy of confusion and
hidden identities characterizes
What The Butler Saw, says
senior drama major and direc-
tor Phil Heldrich: The Universi-
ty Theatre’s production of The
Joe Orton play is scheduled to
run next Tuesday, Friday and
Saturday, May 29 and June 1-2,
at 8 p.m. in the Boiler Room
Theatre as part of the annual
spring Total Theatre program.

The confusion begins with a
psychiatrist’s attempt to seduce
a young woman applying for the
secretary’s job in his office.
Once she is convinced to strip
down for a “physical examina-
tion,’ by Dr. Prentiss (Mike
Moore), the doctor’s wife
stumbles in on the action in the
office — totally unaware of the
girl’s presence. The naked lady
is hidden until Mrs. Prentiss
(Anne Secor) brings in a young
man who stripped her, attemp-
ted a rape and took pictures of
her the night before — and now
intends to blackmail her!

The doctor derives a scheme
which involves switching the
identities of the applicant (Kim
Baker) and the young man,
known as Nick (Charlie
Prioleau) —- who dons women’s
garb to aid in the cover-up. Add-
ed to the confusion is police
surveillance and many other
complications before the final
plot twist at the end.

The play is evidently quite
sexual in nature, and much of
its comic effect relies on
sexually-oriented humor. But it
was a smash success in its
original presentation, though
playwright Orton was killed
before getting a chance to
witness his creation in its final
form.

The script is so liberal, in
fact, that Heldrich said his big-
gest production problem was
obtaining an actress to play the
part of the applicant, Geraldine
Barclay. Originally cast in the
part was a Lexington High
School student. However, when
her father read the script, he

This Friday at 8:30 p.m. the
featured band in the Cockpit
- will be Dodge d’Art, from
Charlottesville. This will be
their second appearance on
campus since their overwhelm-
ing performance at the MD
Danceathon last March.

Dodge d’Art is Jimmy Eau,
Chris Halpin, and John Young,
on lead guitar, bass and drums,
respectively. It is hard to
believe that only three people
can put out such a good sound,
but they do it song after song.
Jimmy and Chris do all the ar-
ranging of hits from the Sixties,

from such groups as the Stones,

Byrds, and Animals. Jimmy |
also writes many of the original ,

tunes that the band performs —
and they will use half of their
own material in each gig.

The guys are very confident

that their music will be ac- ,

cepted by enthusiastic au-
diences as they continue to play
throughout the state of Virginia,
and other states as well.

There will be a cover charge
of $1.00 for W&L students, $2.00
for non-W&L students.
Showtime is at 8:30 p.m., Fri-
day, May 25.

Kim Baker, a Mary Baldwin

Heldrich said the show should
prove very entertaining. Its
“pseudo-nudity” will draw a
great deal of attention, he
predicted.

Italian Comedy To Be

by Carren O. Kaston

The last W&L Film Society
movie of the season will be Et-
tore Scola’s 1978 Italian comedy
We All Loved Each Other So
Much, in color. It will be shown
free of charge in classroom “‘C”’
of the Law School on Friday and
Saturday, May 25th and 26th, at
8 P.M. An_ end-of-the-year
reception will follow the movie
on both nights in the Lewis Hall
lounge. Everyone is invited.

Scola’s movie pays tribute to
the Italian Neo-Realist school of
film-making and to one of its
greatest directors, Vittorio De
Sica, who is best known for The
Bicycle Thief, Umberto D., Two
Women, and The Garden of the
Finzi-Continis. Italian Neo-
Realism channeled the energies
released after W. W. II into a
cinema of social conscience and
concern for the ordinary man.
It believed in the documentary
power of the everyday surfaces
of life to reveal what was mean-
ingful and ‘‘real’’ about ex-
perience. It sought to define the
possibilities of cinema apart
from the theatre, and it moved
away from the ostentatious ex-
perimeatation in camera and
editing techniques to which the
theatrical background of direc-
tors like Murnau and Eisenstein
had led. Instead, it emphasized
the dignity and value of human

life as revealed in unobtrusive
camera work and minimal
editing.

As ideas about what was
“real” became less sure (par-
ticularly apparent in the rise of
French New Wave films),
however, the Neo-Realist sense
that “reality’’ resided in sur-
faces and external ap-

pearances, the look of things;

came to seem inadequate.
Scola’s tribute to the Neo-
Realist movement, therefore,
both celebrates its humanity,
and reveals the limitations of its
assumptions about what con-
stitutes ‘‘real”’

inner reality, those moments in
which characters’ emotions are
so intense that they feel as
though they have transcended
the everyday world. With
wonderful delicacy | and fond-
ness, the movie explores the

period of many years. They ex-

make painful compromises,

Golf Team Places
11th In Nationals

The Washington and Lee golf
team finished eleventh in The
Division III National Cha ion-
ships held at the Brandermill
Country Club in Richmond, Va.

W&L was one of twenty teams
selected on the basis of regular
season play. The Generals
finished earlier this month with
a 14-2 overall record.

The four-day tournament,
held May 15-18, saw the golfers
move from a disappointing 19th
place slot after the first round,
and go steadily upward.
However, their advance was
halted just short of the top ten
level.

Five W&L golfers _par-
ticipated in the event: Dave

Leunig, Gerry Barousse, Andy
Fitzgerald, Bill Alfano, and Jim
Kaplan. Barousse, a sophomore
from New Orleans, gained
second-team All-American
honors in finishing at a tie for
eleventh place overall.

Emerging as 1979 team cha
ions were the golfers from
University of California —
Stainslaus, who placed five men
on the three All-American
teams.

W&L coach Buck Leslie was
pleased with the team’s pro-
gress during each round of the
tournament; still, he cited the
difficult Brandermill course as
one reason for his team’s high
scores.

by David Greer

Many students are complain-
ing about the harsh treatment
the faculty has threatened the
fraternities with for miscon-
duct. Before they begin yearn-
ing for the good old days,
though, they should consider
how it used to be.

A glance through a file of IFC
Judicial Board minutes reveals
that in the mid to late sixties
fraternities were punished
severely for what was then call-
ed misconduct and what is now
standard operating proceedure.

The biggest problems came
from rules prohibiting females
in the fraternity houses after 2
a.m. every night except Friday
and Saturday nights of Dance
Weekends, when they could
stay until 3 a.m.

Here are some examples of
misconduct in connection with
this rule. and the subsequent
punishments :

In 1969, several girls were
seen above the ground floor of a
fraternity and some girls spent
the night, claming their rides
had left them. The fraternity
was placed on social probation
for a month.

In 1966, a housemother saw a
senior come down from the se-
cond floor with his date. He was
reminded that this was against
the rules. He and his date were
discovered the next morning
sleeping on the couch
downstairs. The IFC did not
prosecute the fraternity
because the offense was of an
individual nature, but the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee put the
student on a week’s social pro-
bation. He had to move out of
the house during that period.

In 1966, Murph reported see-
ing several dates leave a frater-
nity after curfew. Because the
house had appeared before the
IFC three times previously, it
was placed on a month’s social
probation.

The IFC heard a case in 1965
where a fraternity had girls on
its premises without a
housemother or chaperone. The
fraternity claimed that the girls
were kept outside on the porch
(where they were given dinner )
and therefore were not in the
house. The IFC clarified the
rule that girls were not allowed
on premises, including the out-
side property, without proper
chaperoning.

The IFC put another house on
social probation for two weeks
for having girls on premises at 4
a.m. in 1970. Another was put on

social probation for a month for
two violations in one weekend.

Rumors in “‘epithetical pro-
portion” of destruction in a
fraternity caused enough con-
sternation on the Hill that the
president of the IFC wrote the
house president, warning him
that his house was putting the
availability of university loans
to fraternities in jeopardy. This
was in 1969.

Rules about hazing and pledg-
ing were enforced by the IFC
when complaints came to its at-
tention.

A fraternity in 1969 held a
pledge activity after the curfew
of 11 p.m. for such activities.
The house was fined $75 and
placed on Conduct Probation

for a year in areas dealing with
pledging.

Two months social probation
was the punishment for one
house who, in 1968, violated
“the basic principles of good
taste.” The pledges put on a skit
in the nude when dates were
present. The president said he
warned the girls of potential
“srossness’’ and asked them to
leave. A fight broke out when a
date was hit on the leg with a
trophy. The Fraternity testified
that there were no references
made to the housemother or her
daughter. Nonetheless, the IFC
took into account complaints
from girls schools and indecent
exposure by two members at a
girls school, when reaching the

The Ring-tum Phi, May 24, 1979, Page 5

Fraternities: On Those “‘Good Old Days”

decision.

For violating the same rule of
violating the principles of good
taste, a house was put on three
week’s social probation. That
house had topless dancers at a
party, who eventually ‘‘took it
all off.”’

Charges of hazing were often
brought before the IFC. A house
was fined $100 for branding its
pledges. The pledges had had
their sides smeared with butter,
and a heated bottle was placed
on the butter. (The mark usual-
ly disappeared within three
days and the pledges testified
that the process did not hurt. )

Student Affairs Committee
imposed a $100 fine on a house

for paddling. In the incident in-
volved, the fraternity claimed
that only one swat with the pad-
dle was administered, and that
was by the pledges’ big brother
as part of a tradition. No
pledges complained of any pain
lasting after the swat.

Another house ‘‘violated the
principles of good taste’’ when
its pledges were across the
street from the house and the
pledge trainer yelled, ‘‘Let me
see 16 moons.”’ Because the IFC
felt this could be damaging to
the fraternity, the fraternity
system, and the University if
witnessed, the house was placed
on six weeks social probation.
This was in 1967.

Admissions Info Encouraging

Fifty-six percent of the ap-
plicants to whom Washington
and Lee University offered ad-
mission for September have
confirmed their decision of
coming to W&L, according to a
summary admissions report by
the university released since
last week’s Ring-tum Phi
report.

The 56 percent figure is an ex-
traordinarily high “‘yield’’ for
any college, according to W&L
admissions director William M.
Hartog, and equals the best
“yield” figure in recent W&L
memory, he said.

Other statistics for the
freshman class that will enroll
in September are even more im-
pressive in many respects, Har-
tog said.

For example, the university
has had a sharp jump this year

in the proportion of ‘‘top-ten-
percent” students who chose
W&L this year, he said.

Of next fall’s total of 369
entering students, 27 percent
rank in the top tenth of their
secondary-school graduating
classes. Last year the com-
parable statistic was 22 per-
cent.

And among next fall’s
freshmen from public high
schools, the ‘‘top-20-percent’’
figure shows an even more
dramatic jump — to 67 percent
from this past year’s 56 percent.

Of the members of the 1979
entering class, 16 at Washington
and Lee will have been valedic-
torians or salutatorians of their

All the statistics are unusual
for a college with as small an

College Board scores remain-

they have at W&L for the past
several years — at an average
of 540 on the verbal test for next
fall’s freshmen and 585 on the
mathematics test, Hartog said.
The combined College Board
score average of 1,125 is within
two percent of the comparable
W&L figures for each year in
the 1970s.

He said there appears to have.

been no dramatic shift in next
fall’s freshmen either in terms
of public-school/private-school

Of next fall’s freshmen, a
bare majority, 51 percent, will
enter from public schools. The
public-school figure has

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Beware
of confusion...

The faculty’s special meeting on fraternities is
scheduled for Monday — and confusion is the order of
the day. Proposals, counter-proposals, and amend-
ments fill the air and the faculty mailboxes. Some
iprofessors, seeing that this may be “one of those
meetings’, are wondering if attendance is to be
taken. And several others have little or no idea what
they will be expected to vote for or against next week.

It would have been our pleasure to print the various
options already presented by the faculty and student
committees, in order to clear some of the fog. But for
the first time this year, nobody’s talking. Evidently
it’s just “too complex’’ for the Phi to print. Well, this
may be true — and as I remain deeply convinced of
the worth of fraternity self-government, I will cer-
tainly refrain from clouding the issue further.

Still, the fact that many professors are themselves
unsure of the proposals and what is to be gained
disturbs me deeply. I would urge (even implore) the
entire faculty to research the matter and give it
serious thought. It was only two years ago that the
faculty — again in a confused meeting — could come
to no decision over when to have the Washington holi-
day break, and ended the marathon session by
eliminating the break altogether! What a shame if the
fraternities fall prey to, an equally rash decision,
made in the midst of confusion and in the interests of

“setting everybody home in time for dinner...”’ :

Journalism Professor Uncovers
Forgotten Radio Inventor

Every schoolchild knows that
radio was “invented” by an
Italian named Guglielmo Mar-
coni, right? It’s there in black-
and-white in the World
Almanac, isn’t it, and haven’t
there been government postage
stamps saying as much, and
what could be proof more
positive than that?

There’s a spot of a problem,
though, with the conventional
wisdom. The fact, you see, is
that radio was invented — that
is to say: intelligible elec-
tromagnetic impulses were
transmitted from one place to
another place without benefit of
connecting wires — _ con-
siderablybefore Marconi was
even born. :

The true story has been there
in the records, in archives here
and there, in scattered bits and
pieces, for more than a hundred
years. But until now it just
never all got pieced together.
And in instances like that,
legends conjure themselves up,
and everyone knows that fan-
ciful stories die hard or not at
all, like the one Mencken
started about Millard
Fillmore’s installing the first
bathtub in the White House.
‘Tain’t so, McGee, but you can’t

stop people from thinking so’

anyway.

Make no mistake about it;
Marconi’s contributions to the
development of practical radio
technology were monumental,
and he deserves all the postage
stamps and all the entries in all
the almanacs.

But he didn’t invent radio. He
brought it up, but he wasn’t its
father. He was its nanny.

Almost nobody has heard of a
dentist named Mahlon Loomis;
he’s never been commemorated
on a postage stamp, and if you
want to see a memorial to him
you have to pull off Virginia
State Route 7 east of Berryville
and read one of those little road-
side markers.

And that — as Mahlon
Loomis’s pioneering ex-
perimentation enables Walter
Cronkite to aver each evening a
hundred and eleven years later
— that is the way it really is.

The saga is told in the new
issue of Iron Worker, an ex-
cellent, but undeservedly
obscure, quarterly journal
published by the Lynchburg
(Va.) Foundry, devoted largely
to details and sidelights of
Virginia history.

The article is by R. H. Mac-
Donald, a veteran broadcaster
himself and now professor and
head of the Department of Jour-
nalism and Communications at
Washington and Lee Universi-

ty. It’s the result of several —

years’ research and an obses-
sion of modest proportion to set
the record straight that Mac-
Donald has never quite been
able to overcome.

Mahlon Loomis’s “inventive

- mind never stayed quiet long,”’

MacDonald observes with
understatement. Early in his
career he developed a new kind
of porcelain compound for the
manufacture of false teeth. In
1881 he received a patent for a
combination briefcase and
miniature Morris chair that you
took along on the train and it
converted into a desk.

That, though, came after he
had succeeded in developing the
principle of radio communica-
tion and making it work. He
formed a company, but his luck
was like Joe Bptfslk’s in the old
Li’l Abner strip. His first in-
vestors lost everything in 1869’s
Black Friday market crash. A
couple of years later the
Chicago fire wiped out his se-
cond set of backers’ assets.
“Finally, the company was put
to rest forever by the Wall
Street panic of 1873.”’

Loomis lived just about
everywhere at one point or
another. He was born in upstate
New York and grew up in what

today is considered suburban
Washington, D.C. He learned
dentistry in Cleveland, practic-
ed for a time in New York, then
soon afterwards moved to
Massachusetts. In the 1870s he:
lived near Lynchburg, where,
incidentally, he invented a
collar-cuff stay. Chicago was
the site of the series of collapses
of his financial ventures. (None
of this is to suggest that he was
a drifter, of course. After all,
Loomis was an inventor and
possessed an education. So let it
be said simply that he was ec-
centric and very, very mobile. )

He died in. 1886 (and,
peripatetic to the end, was
buried in West Virginia). It was
nine years later that Marconi
received his patent for a system
of transmitting radio signals.

In 1922 Literary Digest, then
preeminent in its field but to-
day, come to think of it, of
memory only slightly more
blessed than Mahlon Loomis’s,
noted with a touch of sadness
that ‘‘plaudits are reserved for
the man who succeeds in mak-
ing the principle or method or
mechanism known to the world,
rather than for the original in-
vestigator. So there is not the
slightest probability that the
name of Mahlon Loomis will
ever supplant that of Marconi
as ‘the father of the radio.’”’

But Iron Worker has lasted
longer than Literary Digest,
and so, as a matter of fact, has
Ron MacDonald. There may be
hope yet.

Washington and Lee’s Ron
MacDonald, chronicler of the
Loomis story, has been hither
and thither himself, too. He
began his career in radio at ©
Boston (Mass.) University.
S»h<cquently he went a little
way north, to Waterbury, Vt.,
but eventually meandered
south and went to work for

Seven faculty members and
13 students from Washington
and Lee University participated
in the 57th Annual Meeting of
the Virginia Academy of
Science in Richmond last week.

In the field of chemistry they
included Dr. Michael A. Pleva,
associate professor of
chemistry; Daniel J. Carucci, a
junior from Pound Ridge, N.Y.;
David H. Harpole Jr., a junior
from Roanoke; Jerome E.
Kahn, a junior from Lexington;
John C. Kisalus, a junior from
Dublin, Ga.; Edward U. Kissell
III, a senior from Birmingham;
William H. Matthai Jr., a junior
from Baltimore; Lucien T.
Megna, a junior from
Lawrenceville, N.J.; Dr. James
K. Shillington, professor of
chemistry, and Dr. John H.
Wise, professor of chemistry.

Participating in the
psychology section were Dr.
Joseph B. Thompson, professor
of chemistry; Robert S. Bates,
a senior from Cold Spring Har-
bor, N.Y.; Andrew D. King, a
junior from Buena Vista; Jay
Allan Lutins, a senior from
Roanoke; Daniel C. Martin, a
senior from Roanoke; Paul A.

phis, and William T.

provide the key. The Texas
primary will be crucial for Con-
nally, and he faces stiff com-
petition from fellow-Texan and
former Congressman and CIA
Director George Bush as well as
from former California gover-
nor Ronald Reagan, who did
well in Texas in 1976. Texas’
Republican Gov. William P.
Clements has repeatedly said
that he is committed to seeing
Jimmy Carter lose Texas in the
1980 election and Clements pro-
mises to be a GOP power

broker. The Texas state
legislature is
debating whether to have a
presidential preference
primary in March and a regular
state and local primary in July,
which is thought to be greatly to
Connally’s advantage because
of his old-line conservative
Democratic support. But 12
liberal state senators were ab-
sent from the legislature for
close to a week and the Texas
Senate had no quorum. The Lt.
Governor finally ordered war-
rants for the arrest and return
of the truant senators.

Connally, also considered to
be the wealthiest GOP can-

on which primaries to enter, but
will probably start in New
Hampshire and enter only
primaries in states that earn

than states that only have

Baker was one of the few
southern politicians who chose
not to exploit the situation,
although he could have preach-
ed racism effectively in
predominantly white Ten-
nessee.

It is expected that much of
Baker’s support will come from
moderate Republicans, _par-
ticularly Ford’s old supporters.
He has few enemies in the party
and in the case of a deadlocked
convention, he might be ad-
vanced as a compromise can-
didate. As Baker himself said,
‘*Republican presidential
chances haven’t been better
since 1952...the country’s

mains to be seen whether the
Republican Party thinks Baker

The Student Body Executive
Committee heard year-end
reports from many of the cam-
pus organizations it provides
funds for.

Dick Schoenfeld of the Cold
Check Committee said the com-
mittee has processed over
$4,000 woth of student’s bad
checks this year. He said
students at the university owe
$381 and students who have left
the university owe $234.

The Student Activities Board
reported that it has set aside
$1,000 for legal fees for the
lawyer handling the contract
dispute with Firefall’s agents.
When accounting for low
revenues from the movies, it
was suggested that perhaps at-
tendance was low due to tighter
security at the door concerning
students smuggling in beer. The
SAB pointed out that many of
this year’s films were very ex-
pensive, and that there was not
sufficient increase in audience
size to justify the expense.

A Calyx spokeman said that
final bills are not in yet, and
that many seniors have not
picked up their pictures or paid
for their sittings. The yearbooks
are expected to be distributed
today or tomorrow.

a reception at a fraternity house
will not be held; instead, Nader
will be greeted at the mock con-
vention cookout this afternoon
at Dr. Colvin’s house.

Wall also suggected that the
IFC draw up a standing list of
fraternity houses for the rota-
tion of receptions, rather than
hve random drawings for each
speaker. He said this might
alleviate problems experienced
earlier this year.

The EC voted to have a party
for the EC members at Beau
Dudley’s house Monday. The
EC originally voted to use $75 of
student funds for this, but
representatives Calvert and
Willis disagreed with the princi-
ple of using student body funds
for something the entire student
body could not benefit from.
The EC changed its decision
and Willis offered to buy a keg
or liquor for the affair. Dydley
and Charlie Scott were ap-
pointed purchasing agents for
the party. Neither of them were
present at the meeting.

Hartog announced in last
week’s Phi that the number of
completed applications W&L
received for 1979 admission was
1,085, up 11.2 percent from last
year’s figure, which had been
the lowest in years. The latest
admissions report continues to
attribute last year’s decline to
the addition of a formidable
essay requirement as part of
the W&L application process.

But the university later con-
cluded that the essay require-
== had a negliglible effect

either on the size or on the
academic talent of the class
that actually enrolled.

Despite last year’s smaller
“pool” of applications, W&L
achieved a class that was ac-
tually larger than the 350 it has
fixed as its annual freshman
goal, and the credentials re-
mained as strong as they had
been in recent years when
larger numbers of applications
were received.

W&L officials speculated that
the essay requirement served
primarily to discourage
students whose writing ability
was inferior.

This year, the university
again included an essay re-
quirement — in modified form
— as part of the application pro-
cedure.

Faculty Accepts
Council Policy

Univ.

by John Billmyre

In a statement passed Mon-
day, the faculty has placed the
future of fraternities in the
hands of their own members
and the Interfraternity Council.

Fraternities must comply
with a new policy next year that
was adopted by the University
Council on May 3.

The new policy limits ‘‘House
Parties” to weekends and
defines parties ‘‘as any function
funded by the treasury or billed
to members on a deferred
basis.”

Fraternities will still be
allowed to have two house-
sponsored weekday parties dur-
ing rush.

Prohibited under the new
policy are parties in Lexington
or at the women’s colleges.

Fraternity members are
allowed to have “chip-in” par-
ties where the party is not
house-sponsored on Wednesday
nights under the new policy.

Fraternities convicted more
than once for violating Lex-
ington’s noise ordinance will
receive escalated punishments
under the new University Coun-
cil policy.

According to a statement the
faculty released after its

meeting on Monday, the faculty
“expresses its faith in this in-
stitution’s students and in their
desire to cooperate,” but is ‘‘not
unwilling to legislate directly
upon any of these matters.”’

Other problems considered
“matters” by the faculty are
the conduct of students at spor-
ting events and women’s col-
leges, the ‘“‘sometimes abusive
and obscene language used in
public and at fraternity func-
tions,” and the exterior ap-
pearance of fraternity houses.

The University Council has
been requested to submit a
report on the i lementation of its
policy to the faculty by early
January.

To be included in the report is
a list of fraternity-related com-
plaints, their source,disposition
and nature.

Also to be presented to the
faculty some time next year are
the results of a Student Affairs
Committee investigation of
fraternities’ role in academic
life at Washington and Lee.

IFC President Syd Farrar
said he was pleased with the
decision because “we have
maintained the right to govern
ourselves.”’

Nader Speaks On

Corporate Power

by David Greer

Ralph Nader, addressing a‘
packed house at Washington
and Lee last Thursday, spoke on
a variety of subjects, focusing
on energy problems and the
dangers of excessive corporate
power.

Nader said that in order for
the market-place economy to
work properly, there must be a
degree of insecurity amoung
the corporations. The giant cor-
porations have become so
secure, he said, that they no
longer feel threatened by con-
sumer pressures.

The government reinforces
the power of the corporations,
he said, through subsidies, in-
flated government contracts,
tax loop-holes, and whole in-

dustry subsidies.
“You don’t go bankrupt
anymore, you go to

Washington,”’ Nader said.

Nader said that the American
public should redefine violence
to go beyond street crimes and
traditional concepts of violence
and include ‘compulsory con-
sumption of pollution’’ and “‘the
silent kind of violence that
sidesteps”’ the senses.

A ‘‘what doesn’t pinch,

doesn’t hurt” ideology keeps
the public from being aware
and concerned about this type
of violence until tragic events
occur, such as the asbestos
poisoning of some shipworkers.

Nader also spoke of how the
educational systems in this

the fraternity system,” said Ex-
ecutive Committee President
Beau Dudley, who attended the
meeting to discuss both the
fraternity system and a pro-
posal to build an on-campus
pavilion, ‘‘but like most pro-
blems, I would rather solve it
myself.”

Farrar further explained the
proposal’s intent: ‘The faculty
wants to cut down on the
number and intensity of par-
ties.”

He added, ‘‘Hopefully, the
parties will tail off after rush.”
Most representatives seemed to
agree, but a Phi Gamma Delta
representative did not. .

Law Admissions Drop
Decline Less Than National Slump

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s School of Law received a
total of 1,177 applications for 115
places in the first-year class
that will enroll in September,
the university said this week.

The number of applications
was down 9 percent from the
1978 figure of 1,287 — a smaller
decline, however, than the na-
tionwide drop in applications to
law schools. That national
decline is estimated at between
10 and 14 percent.

The number of applications to
W&L’s law school represented
10 for each place in the entering
class.

The students who have con-
firmed their plans to enroll in
next fall’s first-year law class
are the smartest the law school

has ever had, judged by their
undergraduate grade-point
averages, according to William
McC. Schildt, assistant law
dean.

The mean GPA of the 135
students who have confirmed
their acceptances to W&L is 3.38
on a 4.0 scale, Schildt said, up
from last year’s 3.27. The
averages for the two preceding
years were 3.27 and 3.28.

The average score on the
standardized Law School Ad-
mission Test (LSAT) dropped
eight points, from last year’s
649 to 641 among the students
who have confirmed their inten-
tion to enroll at W&L in the fall.

Last year’s 649 LSAT average
was an exception to the mean
scores in other recent years. In

UC Proposal Bans
Midweek Parties

At its meeting of May 3, the University Council adopted by a vote of 19-3 the
following interfraternity Council proposal, as amended by the Student Affairs
Committee, to become effective in September 1979.

“In response to the pending faculty motion, the Interfraternity Council and all of
the individual fraternities have taken a serious look at the concerns expressed in
the motion. It is the consensus of fraternity members and their officials that we
must improve in a number of areas and reaffirm the faith of all concerned that we
are capable of self-government. All fraternities are aware that the situation is in-
deed a serious one in the minds of the faculty. We believe strongly that the IFC
should remain the governing body of fraternities, and that Washington and Lee
would not be made a better place by the mandatory imposition of faculty
guidelines in anything short of an absolute emergency situtation.

The following proposals have been approved by the IFC. They are offered as a
strong indication of our willingness to deal effectively and fairly with the problems
as you have pointed them out to us.

(1) ‘House Parties”’ are defined by the IFC as any function funded by treasury
or billed to the members on a deferred basis. The term will include such a function
held either in Lexington or at one of the women’s colleges. The IFC will adopt a
rule prohibiting any such House Party on any weeknight (Sunday through Thurs-
day). Any violation of this provision will require an automatic investigation by the
Judicial Board, to enforce subsequent punishment. The penalty will increase for
any additional violation. A fraternity will be allowed to have two Wednesday
house-sponsored parties within the first three weeks of the fall semester coinciding
with Rush.

(2) All parties must conform to the local noise ordinance as enforced by the Lex-
ington Police. Any house receiving a summons which results in an ultimate finding
of guilty by a local court will result in an investigation and review by the Judicial
Board, at which time punishment will be decided. The penalty will increase for
each additional violation.

(3) The IFC Constitution strictly prohibits any hazing which constitutes any
physical or emotional hazard to a student or which interferes with his academic
performance. The IFC, as it does now, investigates any alleged incident in viola-
tion of this rule, and any violation will result in an investigation by the Judicial
Board. Weekday pledge activities will be restricted to one night a week and shall
not extend beyond 8:00 p.m. All other pledge activities will be restricted to the
weekends.

(4) The IFC fully understands the intent and tone of the faculty motion, as does
each fraternity. We list the following areas as requiring our attention and improve-
ment, and commit ourselves to good faith efforts in each of these areas:

(a) The public conduct of some members both locally and at our own sporting
events.

(b) The conduct of individuals and fraternities as a group while guests at the

women’s colleges.

(c) The exterior appearance of the fraternity houses and grounds which on oc-
casion is an eyesore to others.

(d) The shouting and sometimes abusive and obscene language used in public
and at fraternity functions.

By recommendation of the Student Affairs Committee and action of the Univer-
sity Council, any violation of the above regulations will result in an automatic and
minimal penalty of two weeks of social probation unless in the judgment of the IFC
Judicial Board and the Student Affairs Committee, there are extenuating cir-
cumstances presented upon appeal.

From The Faculty...

(Passed in meeting of May 28)

To The IFC, SAC, and the University Council:

The Faculty appreciates the constructive action toward more effective self-

oe of fraternities taken by the IFC and endorsed by SAC and the University
ouncil.

_ The Faculty concures with the IFC’s position that self-regulation by fraternities
is preferable to rules the faculty might impose. And it urges you to bear in mind the
following observations.

Fraternities and fraternity members are to govern themselves in accord with
the following catalogue statement:

Fundamental to all other aspirations of Washington and Lee University are two
basic purposes:

— The dedication of all its resources to the development of man’s capacity and
desire to learn, to understand, and to pass on to others the varied benefits of this in-
tellectual growth.

_ — The pursuit of its educational purpose in a climate of learning that stresses the
importance of the individual, his harmonious relationship with his fellow-man and
~ reponsibility to serve society through the productivity of his training and
talent.”

Fraternities undeniably add a dimension to student social life at W&L; that
dimension should complement the educational purposes of the University. Mid-
week party activities on fraternity premises conflict with, rather than comple-
ment, academic life. The faculty feels confident you will, in the months to come,
eliminate such conflicts.

All initiation and pledge activities classifiable as hazing violate the ‘‘importance
of the individual, his personal honor and integrity.” In recent years student reports
to faculty about hazing have increased in number and frequency; many of these
reports describe abhorrent actions degrading to the participants, actives as well
as pledges. You can, by open discussion and inquiry, bring your own forms of
pressure to bear upon those whose behavior disgraces the entire fraternal system.

Excessive noise, ear-splitting live or recorded music, obscene comments, and
lewd or destructive conduct, whether in Lexington or on neighboring campuses,
violate a “harmonious relationship’ with one’s fellow-man. Fraternities enjoy a
generous compromise in the matter of noise since fraternity neighbors generally
tolerate loud party music during weekend evening hours. Fraternities must,
however, respect their neighbors’ right to rest undisturbed in the privacy of their
homes during late night and early morning hours.

The Faculty also anticipates your re-analysis of both the present rushing system
and the entire question of fraternities’ interference with the freshman’s adjust-
ment to academic demands. In the months to come, faculty representatives on the
University Council and SAC will discuss these subjects with you.

The Faculty requests the University Council to submit before January 7, 1980, a
written report on the implementation of its policy of May 3, 1979, and of
disciplinary actions taken to enforce that policy. The Dean of Students should in-
clude in that report a list of fraternity-related complaints including their general
source, nature, and disposition. The University Council is also to share with the
Faculty all results of the SAC investigation of fraternities’ role in academic life
and any steps the Council takes pursuant to that report.

Reluctant but not unwilling to legislate directly upon any of these matters, the
Washington and Lee Faculty expresses its faith in this institution’s students and in
their desire to cooperate in achieving the exalted goals common to us all.

A sexuality survey conducted
at Mary Baldwin College and
Washington and Lee shows that
88 percent of the males and 68
percent of the females who
responded are not virgins.

The survey, conducted by
Steve Abraham and Kristin
Durway, students at Mary
Baldwin and W&L in _ the
Masculine/Feminine Role and
Relations course, was taken
this spring at the two schools.

Of those respondents who are
not virgins, most of them lost
their virginity at age 17. Of the
females, 26 percent were 17, 20
percent 18, and 13 percent 19
years old. Of the males, 18 per-
cent were 16, 26 percent 17, and
19 percent 18 years old.

Of the respondents who said
they were virgins, most said the
reason for not having sex was
religious or moral, with 39 per-
cent of the males and 33 percent
of the females giving this
response. Of the females, 27

percent feared the affect on
future marriage and 16 percent
of the males gave this reason.

Fear of pregnancy was the
reason cited by 22 percent of the
males and only 13 percent of the
females responding to why they
had not had sex.

Of the respondents, 82 percent
of the females and 88 percent of
the males have participated in
oral sex. In answerin~ *4e ques-
tion, ‘““Have you eve mastur-
bated.”” 77 percen of the
females and 88 percy..t of the
males said they have.

When asked if they had par
ticipated in sex with a member
of the same sex, 13 percent of
the males and 18 percent of the

female respondents said they
had.

Few of the respondents said
they had participated in group
sex; only four percent of the
females and eight percent of the
males replied affirmatively.
However, 33 percent of the
males said they would like to
try it while only five percent of
the females agreed.

Most of the respondents of
both sexes have had intercourse
with three or less people — 54
percent of the females and 36
percent of the males. Of the
female respondents, nine per-
cent have had sex with four to 10
people and four percent with
more than 10. Of the males, 30
percent have had sex with four
to 10 people and 26 percent with
more than 10.

Most of the female
respondents (87 percent) who
are not virgins use contracep-
tives. The pill is the most fre-
questly used at 38 percent; 23
percent each use rhythm or
other methods, not including
diaphragm, IUD, or creams or
jellies.

When asked about the fre-
quency of having intercourse,
36 percent of the females and 23
percent of the males said once a
week. Less than once a month
was the highest frequency for
the males, at 34 percent, and se-
cond highest for the females at
14 percent.

Of the male respondents, 65
percent said they have asked a
female if she is presently using
contraceptives when it is ob-
vious they are going to engage
in intercourse. Of those, 74 per-
cent said they used some type of
precaution if her answer was

no. Of those who never asked, 46
percent said they didn’t care if
any precaution was taken, 23
percent did not know how to
mention the subject, and 30 per-
cent considered it understood it
was their responsibility and
took the necessary precaution.

Of the female respondents, 40
percent who do not use con-
traceptives said they had asked
a male they were about to have
sex with if he was going to use a
contraceptive. Four percent
said they had not done this. Of
those who had and whose part-
ner had said he wasn’t going to
use a contraceptive, 89 percent
said they told him they would
not have intercourse. Those

who never asked offered no
response to questions about
their reasons for not asking.
Supposing they were preg-
nant, 39 percent of the
respondents said they would tell
the father and 46 percent said
they would have an abortion.

Supposing a girl they had had
sex with got pregnant, 42 per-
cent of the men would recom-
mend and offer to pay for an
abortion, 17 percent would want
her to have the baby, and six
percent would ask the girl to
marry them. One percent would
never want to see the girl again
and three percent would rather
she not tell them.

The respondents were asked

if they thought premaritial sex
for mere pleasure was as per-
missible as premaritial sex for
love. Of the females, 23 percent
said yes, nine percent usually,
27 percent not usually, and 41
percent answered no. Of the
males, 44 percent said yes, 18
percent usually, 23 percent not
usually, and 17 percent said no.

When asked if they ever had
guilt feelings after having sex,
nine percent of both groups said
they had. 35 percent of the
males and 32 percent of the
females said sometimes, and 50
percent of the males and 41 per-
cent of the females said they
had never had guilt feelings
after sex.

Mahan Awards Presented
To Student Writers

Three Washington and Lee
University students have been
named winners in the annual
George A. Mahan Awards com-
petition in creative writing,
sponsored by Washington and
Lee’s English department.

James R. Leva, an English
major from Morristown, N.J.,
won the junior prose award for
his play ‘“‘Dream Movie.”

An experimental work using a
combination of techniques —
for example, film and live ac-
tors in the same space — the
play was recently performed by
students in Washington and
Lee’s spring drama program.

The sophomore prose award
was presented to Robert S.
Piazza of Baltimore for his

story “‘A Brother of My Own,”
an impressive attempt to catch
an authentic fictional voice, ac-
cording to James Boatwright,
W&L English professor and a
Mahan Award judge.

The poetry award was
presented to Andrew F. Trotter,
a freshman from Roanoke.

The creative writing competi-
tion was established at

 

Washington and Lee by George
A. Mahan of Hannibal, Mo., an
alumnus who died in 1936. The
award consists of a $100
scholarship or $60 in cash.

A Physicist Poses Some Tough Questions
For The Layman About Three Mile Island

By H. Thomas Williams

Assistant professor of physics
.. . A multitude of technical
questions must now be address-
ed by technical people, of
course — by the people who
design, build and operate

nuclear reactors in particular.
These are basically questions
for science and for scientists —
but the ‘‘scientific method” not-
withstanding, they will be
answered in different ways by

tinent to examination of the
Three Mile Island questions is
much smaller yet.

In order to make intelligent
and appropriate policy deci-
sions, therefore, our lawmakers
will have to decide among paths
suggested by nuclear experts
who themselves are in con-
siderable conflict.

different authorities. Public-
policy decisions will generally
be made by non-scientists, and
therein lies a great problem
both for the decision-makers
and for the rest of us.

The scientists who study the
problems must act in an ad-
visory role to the decision-
makers in the power-generation
industry and at various levels of
government. Ultimately, of
course, the major decisions will
be made by the Congress.

Typically, however, a Con-
gressman is a lawyer. Most
Congressmen have
backgrounds in the liberal arts.

The sum of the scientific
training among members of
Congress is miniscule — and

scientific training which is per-

legislators is this: Not all scien-
tists are honest and not all
scientists are competent. How
can one distinguish between
good science and bad? How
does one decide among conflic-
ting scientific viewpoints? The
simple fact that there can be
more than one valid scientific
viewpoint on a single issue may
come as a surprise to laymen; it
is nevertheless true.

In presenting information
about the Three Mile Island
crisis to the public, the news
media sometimes represented
the confusion of the initial days
accurately. In other instances,
however, the media aggravated
or even created the confusion.

were commonly printed as
“Nuclear Plant Potentially Ex-
plosive.”” In point ‘of narrow
technical fact, the headline was
accurate. But to much of the lay
public, conditioned by nuclear-
holocaust fiction or by the
scenarios postulated by those
who are ideologically opposed
to nuclear power and weaponry
policies, the juxtaposition of the
two words ‘‘nuclear’’ and “‘ex-
plosive’”’ conjured up visions of
mushroom clouds, widespread
death, and general devastation.

The fact is that the Three Mile
Island reactor was never in
danger of becoming a nuclear
bomb.

The feared explosion would
have been a chemical one. The
radiation leakage accompany-
ing such a chemical explosion
could indeed have _ been
disastrous — but there would
not have occurred the release of
awesome energy and power of a
true nuclear blast.

So the headline — even

follow.”

The news media must search
for answers to several questions
about their own role in the way
the Three Mile Island incident
was represented to the public.
In such matters — when the
subject matter is poorly
understood both by reporters
and by their readers or listeners
— how can the rights of the
media to report and the public
to know be satisfied? Who,
among those who understand
the scientific complexities and
uncertainties of such a subject,
are the media’s ‘usually
reliable sources’’?

**e#*

The American people must,
as best they can, develop an
understanding of the problems
so conspicuously posed by the
Three Mile Island accident —
and develop an understanding
of the multiplicity of possible
solutions. Beyond the dilemma
of conflicting ‘‘expert”’ opinion,
the public is faced with the pro-

scientific “‘fact,’’ of science’s
limitations. Taking a single
science course in school does
not provide this insight; even a
college degree in a science does
not often lead to this kind of ap-
preciation of science as a whole.

Most members of 20th-
century American society who
are well educated have been
taught an appreciation of the
arts. The analagous 18th-
century appreciation of science
— “natural philosophy’’ — has
all but disappeared, even as it
has changed from the status of
intellectual luxury to near-
requirement for ultimate sur-
vival.

This article is excerpted from
the new issue of the Washington
and Lee University Alumni
Magazine.

Tom Williams writes that

belm of receiving nearly all its
information about the con-
troversy through only-partially-
understanding medea. Sorting
it all out is far from easy.

We in the public must look for
intelligent answers to the same
questions our legislators face.
What are the limitations of
science? To what extent are the
questions raised as a result of
Three Mile Island scientific,
and to what extent are they
ethical and moral? How shall
we choose to educate our youth
to answer even more deman-
ding and troublesome questions
to come?

Educators need to examine
the system of teaching, at all
levels, from the point of view of
the degree of understanding
and appreciation of science
they provide the non-scientific
majority. We cannot hope to
make nuclear experts of
everyone so as to be able to han-
dle future Three Mile Islands
wisely — just as the general
public cannot, for example,
aspire to learn enough about
biochemistry to be able con-
fidently to make decisions in the
field of genetic engineering.

But it is not too much to ex-,
pect that we should produce
educated citizens, regardless of
field of academic emphasis,
who possess a comprehension of
what science is, of how it is car-
ried out, of what constitutes

am not an expert in nuclear
power generation, nuclear reac-
tors, or nuclear safety. In that
respect I am unqualified to add
to the already numerous (and
often conflicting) explanations
of what happened at Three Mile
Island, or to the equally
numerous suggestions (equally
in conflict) about what should
be done as a result.

“IT am, however, a_ voter,
parent, educator and scientist,
and am therefore bold enough
to speculate in those capacities
on some of the matters which
need now to be considered about
nuclear energy, public policy,
and safety.”

Williams received his Ph.D.
from Virginia and has taught at
Washington and Lee since 1974.
This is not the first time he has
found himself concerned with
the mesh — or the lack of it —
between hard science and the
so-called “‘humanities.”” He and
W&L’s University Historian,
Taylor Sanders, have just
developed (with grant support
from W&L and the Virginia
Foundation for the Humanities
and Public Policy) an inter-
disciplinary program for
laymen promoting the 18th-
century concept of ‘natural
philosophy” as an essential con-
Sideration in 20th-century
education.

Bests And Worsts Of The Cinema Year

by Dick Barron

For our last movie column of
the year, so it seems ap-
propriate that we look back at
the films of the 1978-79 school
year.

This was not a year for
musicals. Of those ambitious ef-
forts which were released, even
the best lacked the ‘“‘spunk’’
which saves a great film from
mediocrity. Grease, the best of
the lot, was lacking in drive, but
Travolta and Newton-John
made a pretty pair. The Wiz,
with Diana Ross, was big and
splashy, but it failed to warm
the heart with its big city cold-
ness. But we did have fun with
Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts
Club Band. It was perhaps the
worst movie of the year and
that made it fun. The serious
parts were hysterical, and the
attempts at humor were
ludicrous (we weren’t laughing
with it, we were laughing at it).
Never have so many big artists
been assembled for such a
magnificent waste of time and
money.

Another big production,
Superman belongs in a class by
itself. It’s difficult to avoid con-
tradictions when discussing this
film. It was too long, the script
was sappy, and much of the act-
ing was limp, yet the special ef-
fects were’ great, the
cinematography was crisp, and
Chris Reeve made a fine Super-
man. And besides, the man of
steel made a lot of gold for the
movie producers.

Television producers made a
valiant stab at putting their dry
fare into the theaters with the
low-life version of Buck Rogers
in the Twenty-fifth Century.

This along with Battlestar
Galactica’s big-screen re-
packaging proved you can take
‘em off T.V., but you can’t make
em any better in a theater.

In comedy, Neil Simon, usual-
ly a respectable writer, left a lot
of us clamoring to check out of
the California Suite. Mean-
while, comedy newcomer Clint
Eastwood became a good ole
boy in the hit Every Which Way
But Loose — a poor man’s
Smokey and the Bandit.

No one who regularly attends

grade ‘‘B’’ movies could forget
that gang-land classic The War-
riors. For sheer violence, well-
done at that, this movie has it
all. Many audience members
were so inspired by The War-
riors that they joined their
friends in re-enacting certain
scenes. The film was pulled
from several metropolitan
theaters due to this audience af-
fection for holding ‘‘rumbles”’
(or gang-warfare). Washington
and Lee Gentlemen found the
film stimulating as well, but

serious film offerings as well.
The Deer Hunter gave us a
thrilling, albeit lengthy account
of the lives of three Penn-
sylvania steel workers during
the Vietnam war days. With
strong violence and tough per-
formances, this was undoubted-
ly the most devastating film of
the year.

The China Syndrome, starr-
ing Jane Fonda (currently play-
ing in Lexington) is a mighty
thriller in its own right. The
“No Nukes’”’ crowd should get a
kick out of the one-sided view of
power companies, and
everybody should be thoroughly
entertained by this finely
crafted film. (By the way, who
cares about Jane Fonda's
politics? She could advocate the
execution of all children under
age two and she’d still be one of
the most beautiful and talented
actresses on the screen today. )

. . . Which brings us to the
latest favorite, Woody Allen’s
Manhattan, the film achieve-
ment of the year. How can he
top this one?; it’s definitely his
best — too bad there’s only one
director capable of Allen’s
genius.

This year was loaded with
film garbage, but there were
just enough good ones to make a
trip to the theater worthwhile.
Your favorites may not have
been mine, but we all agreed at
various times. One thing is cer-
tain, we have an interesting
summer to look forward to —
Alien and Apocalypse Now

Happy Tunes: New Wave Is Not Washed Up

by Mark Kinniburgh

Despite the many Anti-Disco
T-shirts that you might see on
the street, the disco
phenomenon has blossomed in-
to a huge industry, especially in
the radio world. A_ recent
meeting of 17 disco-oriented
radio stations belonging to the
Burkhartrams group in Atlanta
featured a guest speaker, Dr.
John Parikhal, a social scien-
tist, who spoke on _ the
sociological aspects of disco
versus rock music. In sum-
mary, Parikhal stated that rock
music appeals to young men
who are afraid of sex. Women,
he contended, can’t relate to
rock music, as they prefer a
smoother sex rhythm of disco.
Parikhal also contended that
the violent rhythm of rock ap-
peals to those having ‘‘teenage
sex frustrations,” and ‘“‘a fear
of being sexually inadequate.”

One can understand how im-
portant it is for the disco pro-
moters to have pride in their
product, even though this at-
tempt was at the expense of the
rock world. What is entirely ob-
vious is the immaturity of disco
as a force in music, a relative
newcomer when compared to
R&B and Rock ‘n’ Roll. The
rock world has moved so quick-
ly in the last ten years that only
now am I finding albums that

are excellent and contem-
porary, although produced, say,
in 1969. There is such a wealth
of creativity on which to draw,
such as the Kinks, the Who,
Beatles, the Stones, the Jeffer-
son Airplane, the Bvrds,
CSN&Y, Dereck am _ the
Dominoes to mention a few, and
this solid base of talent has led
the way for the New Wave of To-
day.

While many esoteric writers
and business people will pro-
claim that rock is dead, and
especially “new wave’’ rock is
dead, two vital forces have sur-
faced and become recognized in

their own right as artists. Talk-
ing Heads, a new wave quartet
spawned by a talent search at
N.Y.C.’s CBGB, have _ two
albums released on Sire
Records, the latest of which re-
mains on the Billboard Hot 100
Album chart 40 weeks after its
summer release.

Talking Heads began as an
artistic trio, and upon finding
themselves bored with the art-
rock scene, decided to turn to
pop music. What happened
then, is quite noticeable from
the two albumsTalking Heads
77 and More Songs About
Buildings and Food. “I can’t

Washington and Lee Univer- a
sity’s first annual Muscular
Dystrophy Dance Marathon
grossed $17,052 last weekend,
according to chairman Jay
Blumberg.

Blumberg, who had set the
original goal at $5,000, said that
the results ‘‘were beyond my
wildest expectations.”

Sophomore Dean Kalamaras
raised the most money in
pledges, bringing in $3,020. In
doing so, he won a trip to

to MD with the stipulation that
the trip be given to a child

Over 1,100 students, faculty,

saw 150,000 volumns moved in
just two and one half hours.

Maurice Leach, head of the
University’s library, called the
book moving operation
‘‘super,’’ which he defined as
“extraordinaily great’ and
“beyond all expectations.”

Originally, the Library Move
Committee had estimated that
the move would require 1,000.

When asked to assess the
sports program at W&L, Bill
McHenry, athletic director at
W&L, said “We had a good year
this year, though not as good as
last year, and we are hoping for
improvement in the future.”’

McHenry further stated that
the primary goal of the sports
program at W&L is to field
teams that are competive in all
sports in Division III with
lacrosse being competitive in
Division I.

In assessing how the sports
program in general did this
year, McHenry pointed to a
comparison of records of this
year’s teams to last year’s
teams. But making a com-
parison, we must take into ac-
count several aspects which
help to explain the success or
failure of an athletic program.

The factors which contribute
to a team’s final record include
a loss of seniors to graduation,
the competitiveness of the
schedule and injuries to key
players. Therefore, without a
complete analysis of these fac-
tors it is difficult to derive a

 

 
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
  

 

  

The Outlook For
W&L Sports In 80

complete conclusion when com- _

paring the records of teams
from year to year.

In football, the team’s record
in 1977 was 3-8; in 1978 it was
2-8. The primary explanations
for this, McHenry said, were
the loss of talented seniors, in-
juries and the transition period
of the team to adjust to the foot-
ball philosophies of Head Coach
Gary Fallon. The team was
young and it took time for the
team and Fallon to become
used to one another.

In swimming, the team did
not enjoy as good a year as the
previous year. Last year the
swimmers finished 10-1 and this
year they ended the season at
2-8’ due in part to the loss of a
number of All-Americans. W&L
has (recently) built one of the
best swimming programs in
Division III. But the man who
has been the main catalyst

RING-TUM PHI

behind W&L swimming, Coach
Bill Stearns, has resigned his
post in order to enter private
business.

Named to succeed Stearns as
head of the swimming program
is the former Head Coach of
Clairmont-Mudd College in
California, Page Remillard.
The new coach brings with him
some impressive credentials in-
cluding the fact that annually
his teams have been one of the
strongest in Division III. Fur-
thermore, his water polo teams
were one of the best on the west
coast in Division III.

In the other sports, the teams
this year finished with records
similar to those of last year’s
teams. However, one of the
most interesting aspects of
these other programs was the
lacrosse team. Last year’s
team finished the regular
season with a 9-4 record and
received a bid to the NCAA na-
tional championships. This
year’s team finished the
regular season with an identical
record of 9-4 yet did not receive
an NCAA bid.

Looking ahead to next year,
Head soccer Coach Rolf Piri-
nian and Head Football Coach
Gary Fallon had some _in-
teresting points about their
teams which will kick off W&L
athletics next year. (The
schedules of these teams were
printed in last week’s Phi).

Coach Pirinian said that his
team will be young but should
be competitive. He said the
schedule is realistic and the en-
thusiasm within the program
has been good. He is looking for
players on the ‘‘B” team this
year to be promoted to the Var-
sity next year and contribute to
the soccer program.

In addition, Pirinian said the
players had successful indoor
and spring soccer programs
during the offseason which
should show results this fall.
Thus, barring injuries, the
outlook for the team seems to be

Wiles And Leunig Share

Brown Memorial Award
At Sports Ceremony

Richard B. Wiles (Danville,
Va.) and David E. Leunig
(Albany, N.Y.) were named co-
recipients of the Preston R.
Brown Memorial Award at the
season ending “All Sports
Barbeque and Award
Ceremony”’ held on May 22nd at
the Wilson Athletic Field.
Presented annually since 1950,
the Preston R. Brown Award is
given to W&L’s Most Valuable
Senior Athlete for overall per-
formance and athletic profi-
ciency during his college
career. It is voted on by
members of the athletic depart-
ment staff, and is considered
the highest honor a Washington
and Lee athlete may receive.

Wiles has been a four-year
letter winner in two sports, foot-
ball and baseball. During his
football career he has been
selected first team All-ODAC as
a wide receiver in 1978, while
achieving second team honors
in 1977. This past year Wiles
was selected as a second team
Academic All-American and is
the recipient of a NCAA Post-
Graduate Scholarship. In
baseball he has served as co-
captain the last two years, and
this year received the Coaches
Baseball trophy which is given
in recognition of unselfish
dedication and contribution to
the baseball program. He also
was named W&L’s Outstanding
Freshman Athlete in 1976.

Leunig is also a four-year let-
terman in two sports, namely
basketball and golf. In basket-
ball he ranks tenth on
Washington and Lee’s all time
career points list with 1005
points. This past season he
received the W&L Basketball
award for his contributions to
the program. In 1978 Leunig
received the Coaches and Cap-
tains award and was named se-
cond team all-ODAC.

Leunig’s golf career is
highlighted by being named
ODAC Golfer of the Year in 1977
and 1979 while being named all-
conference three times. This
past year he received the Felix
Smart MVP award and served
as the team’s co-captain.

qualities of true W&L spirit and
Sportsmanship in his career.

 

Pressler Is

Frosh MVP

 

Mike Pressler (Wilson, Ct.)
was named the winner of the
Outstanding Freshman Athlete
Award. That award was
established in 1960 to honor the
frosh athlete who showed the
most athletic ability through his
participation in one or more
sports. Pressler, a graduate of
Wilton High School, played mid-
dle guard in football and was an
attackman on W&L’s nationally
ranked lacrosse team.

The thirteen W&L_inter-
collegiate sports teams combin-
ed for ninety-three victories and
ninety-seven defeats this year.
The 1977-78 varsity teams set a
school record with one hundred
eight victories. With an
undergraduate enrollment of
1397, 342 athletes or 24.5% of the
total student body competed in
intercollegiate contests in
1978-79.

6 Of 13 Teams
End Up On Top

 

Six of the thirteen teams com.
pleted their seasons with win-
ning records — water polo 11-9
in the fall; basketball 17-10,
wrestling 6-5 in the winter; and
golf 14-2, lacrosse 9-4 and track
and field 7-2 in the spring.

Two W&L teams won cham-

- pionships in the Old Dominion

Athletic Conference, both suc-
cessfully defending their 1977-78
titles Wrestling and _ tennis.
Four W&L athletes were named
ODAC Players of the Year in
their respective sports — Carl
Folcik in football, Ed Rodgers
for the second consecutive year
in wrestling, Dave Leunig for
the second time in the last three
years in golf, and Stewart

oe a

Jackson in tennis.

Washington and Lee’s Gary
Franke was named Coach of the
Year in two sports — wrestling
and tennis. This is the first time
that a conference coach has
won the award in two sports.

Three W&L teams achieved
national rankings led by the ten-
nis Generals who finished in a
tie for fourth this spring. The
golf team finished eleventh in
the NCAA Division III national
tournament. The _ lacrosse
Generals completed the year
ranked twelfth nationally by the
USILA in the University Divi-
sion, after being ranked as high
as eighth at one point in the
season.

Five W&L athletes received
All-American honors in 1978-79,
with three of them being first
team choices. The swimmers
led the way with two All-
Americans, Chip Hoke and
Drew Pillsbury. Stewart
Jackson achieved All-American
honors in tennis by finishing
among the top eight singles
players in the national cham-
pionships. Gerry Barousse was
named All-American in golf and
Carl Folcik received honorable
mention recognition in football.

Each sport’s most valuable
performer was announced at
the ceremony as well, and they
are as follows: baseball — Thad
Ellis; basketball — Carby Hoy;
cross-country — Richard Bird;
football — Stewart Atkinson (of-
fensive) and Carl Folcik (defen-
sive); golf — Dave Leunig and
Gerry Barousse; lacrosse —

Sports Outlook Discussed

(continued from page 8)
that they will be energetic, and
a group that cannot be taken
lightly.

Coach Fallon stated that he
expects his team to be an im-
proved team, but young as well.
He pointed to the loss of a
number of talented seniors and
the fact that only eight seniors
will play next year. Thus, the

team will be dominated by-

sophomores and incoming

freshmen.

In addition, the schedule is
composed entirely of Division
III teams and should allow the
team to be competitive in all

games. Also, the transition
period that hindered the team
last year is over and therefore

the team will not have to start
next year learning a new
coach’s football philosophy.

Finally, Fallon pointed to the
fact that the players’ attitude
toward the program is greatly
improved over last year’s. This
can be seen in the tremendous

success of the offseason weight
program.
Hence, the football team can

also point with confidence to a
coming season in which

repeated victories do not seem
a remote possibility.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Farewell

I suppose it is part of Lexington’s charm — that
sense of time standing still which allows our four
years here at W&L to. pass almost before we know it.
But in the past week, a sense that the end has come
for the Class of 1979 is everywhere: the exams are ap-
proaching, no one seems to cash student checks
anymore, Mr. & Mrs. Duck are urging everyone to
visit them one last time before they close next
Wednesday, and so on. You can find seniors
everywhere, standing in silent thought before the Col-
onnade, Lee’s statue, even Goshen Pass.

Our years here may have passed rapidly, but they
were not without memorable achievements. Forgive
me for a most natural bias, but it is my feeling that
the Class of 1979 has been one of the most spirited, ac-
complished groups to be seen on the campus. We were
on hand for every one of those dynamite blasts which
formed the new library, yet the seniors took the lead
in organizing the now-legendary ‘“‘Great Move’’ in
January. Our Mock Convention was done and gone in
1976; still, many seniors have worked long hours since
then, for an event in 1980 they will probably never see.
Members of the Class of 1979 founded the Student
Recruitment Committee, today a vital admissions
force. From our ranks have come two Fulbright
Scholars, not to mention Luce, Truman, and Rotary
— and it seems that our valedictorian will be one of a
small handful ever to graduate with a perfect 4-point
average. The seniors on the 1978-79 Executive Com-
mittee have set a tone of achievement and fairness
that will be hard to equal in any year. And finally,
even this rag you hold at the moment has been
managed by the Class of 1979 for the two years which
saw it grow — hopefully — into a college newspaper of
which we may all be proud.

With this issue, your editor thankfully completes
117 editions of the Ring-tum Phi. It is my hope that
some of the issues were as memorable for you as they
were for us — reflecting most of the victories and
upsets of your time here. And, to those of you who will
be back next year, one request — never hesitate to
give of your time and talents, to the Phi or any other
student organization. With the proper amount of ef-
fort, the Class of 1980 will soon be able to boast an
even better record than ours. And oddly enough, class
spirit notwithstanding, I am sure that this year’s
seniors wouldn’t want it any other way.

Student condemns lack of grade inflation at W&L

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi

As a graduating senior, I would like to
recommend a change in W&L’s grading
system. During the last decade or two, most
academic institutions have experienced a
significant amount of “grade inflation.”
Washington and Lee, however, has managed
to keep its typical grade point average well
within the boundaries of the ‘‘gentleman’s C.”’
Although this situation, the indefatigable mis-
sion of our faculty, might be an “effective”
way for them to maintain W&L’s adademic
standards, it places W&L grads at a substan-
tial disadvantage when applying for either a
job or to grad school.

In my case, as well as that of many others,
the lower of two possible grades has been
received a substantially greater number of
times than the higher grade than seems
statistically possible. Although I do not
believe that students should be given grades
they do not earn, I also do not think that the
substantial difference between an 89 and an 80
should receive the same grade point value —
a 3.0. Obviously, the proximity of the 89 to an
A, and the 80 to a C proves that they are not
equal as W&L’s current grading system

Without a doubt, W&L’s grade evaluation
procedure is very inequitable. In my opinion,
and that of many colleges, the implementa-
tion of a plus/minus grading system would
not only remove a great deal of unfairness, by
giving an 89 a 3.5 gradepoint for example, but
would also be an incentive for students to do
more than the bare minimum of work
necessary to break the lower grade category
barriers. In addition, I believe that this
system would be beneficial to students whose
cumulative averages do not accurately por-
tray the quality of their work.

However, even if this improved system is
implemented, the fact remains that the result
of the grading philosophies of many W&L pro-
fessors is still a severe handicap to graduates.
As I mentioned earlier, I do not advocate pro-
fessors assigning students undeserved
grades, yet I also believe, strongly, that pro-
fessors need to be more realistic in evaluating
students’ work. Since students from other col-
leges, our co etitors in applying to graduate
schools, receive substantial breaks in grades,
I believe that the least amount of considera-
tion due W&L students is a break toward the
higher grade in borderline cases.

Faculty Promotions

Announced

Promotions in rank have been
announced for eight members
of the undergraduate faculty at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty.

Current associate professors
who will become full professors
Sept. 1 are James J. Donaghy of
the physics department, John
K. Jennings of the Department
of Journalism and Communica-
tions, and J. Ramsey Martin of
the philosophy department.

Promoted from assistant to
associate professor will be John
R. Handelman of the Depart-
ment of Politics, John M.
McDaniel of the Department of
Sociology and Anthropology,
Pamela Hemenway Simpson of
the art department, and H.
Thomas Williams of the physics
department.

Isabel Mecllvain, W&L’s
sculptor-in-residence, will be
promoted from instructor in art
to assistant professor.

The promotions in rank were
approved Saturday by
Washington and Lee’s board of
trustees at its regular spring
meeting on the campus.

Donaghy, who received his
Ph.D. from the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
has taught at W&L since 1967.
He was an assistant physics
professor at Virginia Military
Institute in 1965-66.

Jennings received his B.A.
degree from W&L and his Ph.D.
from Stanford. He taught at

country focus on the corpora-
tion’s concerns rather than the
consumers. He said that
employment opportunities
determine curriculums at most
schools and that concepts,
rather than current concerns,
get the most attention.

“Once we get into the produc-
tion side of the economy after
graduation, we look at issues
from the side of production, not
consumption,’’ Nader said.

Nader said that presently
power is less succeptible to
displacement and is too secure.
Power should be insecure to be
more responsible.

“If power thinks it can loose
its power, it becomes more
receptive” to consumer needs,
Nader said.

Employment in large cor-
porations ‘‘biforcates the
human personality,” Nader
warned. People should combine
work and value sytems and con-
science at their jobs, and not
leave their consciences at
home.

Nader spoke extensively
about the dangers of nuclear
energy and offered solar energy
as the safest and most feasible
alternative.

“The plan is to keep us hook-
ed on a source of energy, that is
monopolistically and
oligopolistically controlled.
This disqualifies solar energy,”’
he said. When one form of
limited supply energy runs out,
another will be substituted.

Nader said, ‘“The waste is the
first focus of concern about our

Washington and Lee from 1960
until 1969, when he joined the
journalism faculty at the
University of Texas. He return-
ed to Washington and Lee in
1973. His field of teaching
specialty is electronic jour-
nalism.

Martin is a Ph.D. graduate of
Virginia who joined the
Washington and Lee faculty in
1968. He was assistant dean of
admissions at the University of
Virginia from 1962 until 1965
and taught philosophy at Tran-
sylvania College, Lexington,
Ky., in 1967-68.

Handelman, a specialist in
Asian studies, has taught
politics at W&L since 1973. He
earned his Ph.D. degree at
Syracuse University and has
undertaken postdoctoral
research work at Virginia.

McDaniel, a B.A. graduate of
Washington and Lee, received
his Ph.D. from the University of
Pennsylvania, the year he join-
ed the W&L faculty. His field of
specialty is archaeology, and he
has been the director of
Washington and Lee’s ar-
chaeological excavation at the
ruins of Liberty Hall, W&L’s
predecessor campus, since the
inception of the project in 1974.
He has had numerous articles
published on that ‘dig’ and is
the author of a monograph,

energy problem.’ He believes
that one major catastrophy will
end the use of all nuclear
energy.

The nukes are subject to
disasterous hijackings, the only
industry given limited liability
by the government and are
uninsurable. :

“Tf it’s not safe enough for the
insurance companies, maybe
it’s not safe enough for people,”’
Nader said.

Nukes are the only form of in-
dustry linked to nuclear
weaponary and the only one
whose wastes are deadly for a
quarter of a million years,
Nader said.

“Future generations may
look at us as the most foolish
generation in history” for con-
sidering nukes, Nader added.

“The faster we put the
nuclear mistake behind us, the
faster we put the solar promise
ahead of us, the faster we will
have a safer planet.”’

Nader concluded his two hour
talk with an extensive question

and answer period which con-
tinued at a reception which
lasted until after midnight.

In response to a question
about the honor system at
Washington and Lee, Nader
pointed out that sanctions are
not applied in the real world to
any degree like they are here
with honor violations. For ex-
ample, nobody has been expell-
ed from the nuclear energy in-
dustry for unacceptible prac-
tices.

Speaking on deregulation of
the oil industry, Nader said that
there is no marketplace com-
petition in the oil business, and
therefore regulation should put
a ceiling on oil prices or else the
prices will go up as high as
OPEC wants them to.

Nader left several books at
the library here and suggested
ways students could get involv-
ed in consumer eduaction and
consumer action.

“Community intelligence is
needed as well as individual in-
telligence,” he said.

also surfaced in 1975 out of the
same ambience as the Talking
Heads, the Ramones. First peg-
ged as a punk-rock group, and
therefore a fad, the Ramones
have fought the misnomer
through 5 albums to date. Con-
stantly misquoted and misinter-
preted, the Ramones insist they
are no more “‘punk”’ than the
early Beatles or Elvis Presley.
“The early Beatles were really
great when they wore leather
jackets and were into hard,
solid rock ‘n’ roll,” says guitar
player Johnny Ramone. The
Ramones were first influenced
in their suburban Forest Hills
homes and began playing as a
band in their high school years.
Although they were discourag-
ed from the beginning by
friends and critics, they kept on
and do the same today. ‘Bad
reviews hurt, but they don’t
have to like us . . . what’s really
bad is when a reviewer not only
knocks your work but throws in
personal insults’’ says another
Ramone brother.

Included in the first Ramones
album is a sampling of rapid
fire 4/4 songs which display a
great deal of intensity and
simplicity which had been lost
to pop music since the Presley
days. One such rocker ‘‘Beat on
the Brat” with lyrics to the
same effect; (‘‘Beat on the Brat
with a baseball bat,’’) is an ex-
ample of the mindless power in
rock and roll similiar to ‘‘Kan-
sas City” or ‘Long Tall Sally”
of the Beatles and Elvis. The
Ramones display a great deal of
sheer power on stage or ablum,
and they are impossible to con-
fuse with any other musicians
today.

Both Talking Heads and the
Ramones share my award for
saving rock ‘n’ roll because
they have succeeded in taking
the five basic components of
rock, a singer, a song, guitar,
bass and drums, and coming up
with a fresh new sound that will
last until the eighties while

other sounds will fade. Although
on opposite ends of the artistic
scale, Talking Heads being
more interested in the total pro-
duct of lyric and music and the
Ramones giving attention to
power and delivery, there is a
vital core to the two which will
foster growth in music to the
same extent that the Beatles in-
fluenced fledgling bands of the
early seventies.
