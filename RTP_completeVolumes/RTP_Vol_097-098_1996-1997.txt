Theta dominatg Derby Days:

Event raises funds for local charities

BY LIZ DETIER
PHI NEWS STAFF WRITER

W &L has Sigma Chi to thank for a
great start to Spring Term.

Once again, Spring Term started out
with Derby Days, a week-long annual
fundraiser for charity sponsored by Sigma
Chi. Derby Days is a competition between
the four sororities to score points and raise
money for their respective charities.

This year, Derby Days kicked-off with

I Spider Monkey at Zollman’s, and was fol-

lowed by football games, a reggae band on
the river, “Singled Out,” Field Day, and a
wine party at Zollman’s.

Derby Days Chairman David Jones
said “The general consensus was that the
girls had a good time, and I know the guys
had a good time.”

This year, Derby Days raised $5500,
according to Jones. The funds were raised

through a combination of T-shirt sales. ads
in the Derby Days programs, the two

Zollman’s parties, and penny voting for
Derby Days King and Queen.

The sororities competed in T-shirt
sales, Penny Voting, Football, “Singled
Out,” and Field Day. Theta and Cl ll-O tied
in T-shirt sales.

Matt Ermigioti and Pi Phi Marga-
ret Lunger were voted Derby King and
Queen.

Meanwhile, Kappa came in first in
football, followed by Th eta.

The results of “Singled Out” were dates
for Derek Van Zant and Theta Jen Galardi,
Jason Ward and Pi Phi Megan Fernstrum,
and Grant Jordan and Theta Kirsten
Smith.

“Singled Out,” a mock version of the
popular MTV game show, was a new addi-
tion to Derby Days and replaced last year’s
“Sorority Feud.”

Most people enjoyed “Singled Out.”

“I think Singled Out should become a tra-
dition. I was cut out pretty early for having
dark eyes, butI played,” said junior Michelle
Bauman.

The overall winner of Derby Days was
Kappa Alpha Theta, followed by Kappa
Kappa Gamma, Chi Omega, and Pi Beta Phi.

Fifty percent of the money raised will be
donated to Sigma Chi’s charity, the Special
Olympics.

The remaining proﬁts will be split among

the sororities, with twenty percent going to
Theta’s charity, CourtAppointed Special Ad-
vocates, ﬁfteen percent to Kappa’s charity,
United Way, ten percent to Chi-O’s charity,
Total Action Against Poverty, and ﬁve per-
cent to Pi Phi’s charity, Links to Literacy.

Derby Days was a great time for a great
cause, and W & L looks forward to it again
next year.

As sophomore Danielle Simonetta put it,
“It’s absolutely one of my favorite weeks at
W&L!”

Bush speaks on state of world affairs

BY LIZ DETIER

PHI NEWS STAFF WRITER
0 ver 3,000 people gathered together

in VMI’s Cameron Hall last Thurs-
day to listen to former President George
Bkush address the VMI cadets. The 41st
president talked about everything from
Desert Storm to Dana Carvey in his hour
long speech.

Bush spoke vehemently about the fu-
ture of the United States and its role in
the world arena. “The United St ates must
continue to stay engaged in the world, ex-
actly the way we did in the Cold War, even
though only one superpwer exists, “said
the former president. He cited such ex-
amples as the tyrannical Saddam Hussein
to support his argument.

Conversely, the former president
stressed how important it was for people

to realize how far the United States has come
in its pursuit of world peace. “We’ve only
begun to reap the beneﬁts of our success in
the Cold War, “declared Bush.

For those who were still complaining
about the state of world affairs, Bush had
only one thing to say: “Roll up your sleeves,
don’t sit b——ing about it.”

The ﬂamboyant ex-president is only the
latest in a series of prominent speakers who
have graced VMI’s campus over the past thir-
teen years as part of the H.P. Johnson, Jr.
‘26 Lecture Series. The ﬁrst speaker in the
series was former President Gerald Ford in
1983, and the last to visit VMI was George
Bush’s Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, in
1993.

The man who endows the series in
memory of his father, a VMI graduate of 1926,
is Belton Kelberg Johnson. According to VMI
Director of Public Relations Lt. Col. Mike

Strickler, the fact that Johnson is a “Texas
Ranger” most likely contributed to his being
able to persuade Bush to visit VMI.

As for Bush’s fee for coming to VMI,
Strickler declined to comment. As George
Bush or Dana Carvey might say, “Not gonna
do it. Wouldn’t be prudent.”

Honor System 1757 
needsinspecﬁon

Absolut Tradition
Paul Saboe ’97

when the sun is shining,
the sky is clear, and a
slight breeze cools the campus,
Head of Security MikeYoung lik-
ens Washington and Lee to a
“little piece of heaven.” [His
words are laced with a certain
truth for there is something
magical about this place, some-
thing which transcends the pres-
ence of Lee Chapel and the Col-
onnade, the knowledge and wis-
dom of the faculty, the untold po-
tential and talents of the student
body.

In essence, the magic of Wash-
ington and Lee ﬂows not from
what we are, but what we hold
dear. Ideals like honor, service,
and community distinguish us
from other academic institutions
as a standard for admiration and
imitation. This column will fo-
cus on those ideals, traditions,
and people who make them pos-
sible in a world such as ours that
more and more has forsaken op-
timism and heroics for cynicism
and apathy.

The ﬁght for honor is a con-
stant struggle, a means and ends
to which very few communities
are willing to dedicate them-
selves. But this we have done
at Washington and Lee. That
myself and others have been able
to freely raise points of discus-
sion regarding a difﬁcult notion
such as honor is testimony to the
enormous confidence we have
placed in our honor system. But
is confidence enough?

It is deﬁnitely more than the
cadets at the U.S. Naval Acad-
emy possess. Over the years,
they have lost control of their
Honor Concept (1 will not lie,
cheat, or steal, and will let the
whole truth be known) only to

L have it replacedvby what An-

napolis instructor James F.
Barry called, “an ethically cor-
rupting system.”

In a 1992 incident, 133 stu-
dents were implicated in a cheat-
ing scandal that saw 24 midship-
men dismissed. In 1995, twenty-
four “would-be officers” were

caught in a drug bust. Within
the past month two seniors were
charged with breaking and en-
tering, a third senior was ar-
rested for molesting a young
child, and “an Academy ﬁve-
striper” was accused of sexually
harassing several women under
his command.

These examples highlight the
often hypocritical, ever cynical
culture that pervades the Naval
Academy, a culture which views
“bilging’ [turning in a classmate]
as an offense far worse than any
honor violation, “loyalty as more
important than truth,” and
honor as an obstacle to over-
come. In essence, the Naval
Academy is the example of what
we are striving most to avoid at
Washington and Lee.

Could our Honor Code ever
decay to the level of the Naval
Academy’s Honor Concept? Yes,
in fact the first signs of decay
may even be visible. In the 1995
senior Exit Survey, 42% of the
graduating seniors surveyed
said they were uncertain
whether they would turn in a
person they knew had commit-
ted an honor violation. The pri-
mary reasons given for this hesi-
tancy to report possible viola-
tions were the relationship to the
violator and a dislike of ratting.
It seems that the dislike for
“bilging” at the Naval Academy
is alive and well at Washington
and Lee.

It is this hesitancy which we
must combat through public dia-
logue, a dialogue consisting of
the proposed student panel dis-
cussion on honor, the upcoming
White Book Review, and infor-
mal discussion. Conﬁdence in
our system by itself will not suf-
ﬁce. Dedication is needed, the
dedication to follow the Honor
Code, to turn in known violators,
and to expand our notion of
honor. Faith is also needed, the

fa,i,_t_h,to believethat through our

system, honor will be achieved
and justice served. It is only
through the combination of con-
fidence, dedication, and faith
that we will achieve a notion of
honor worthy of our position as
the heirs to Washington and Lee,
and all they hold dear.

Washington’s Blood Sport

Ends & Means
Joshua Heslinga ’98

As the 1996 election approaches and the
public begins to reﬂect on the Clinton
presidency, no doubt some of the most en-
during memories will be of scandal. The
Clintons and White House personnel have
repeatedly attempted to put such scandals
as Whitewater, the death of Vince Foster, the
firing of the White House travel staff,
’I‘roopergate, and the Paula Jones sexual ha-
rassment case behind them.

’I‘o their surprise and consternation, they
have had little success and; have only suc-
ceeded in raising more questions with con-
stant hedging, denials, protestations or ig-
norance, and attempts to place the blame
elsewhere.

A few weeks ago, James B. Stewart pub-
lished Blood Sport, the first and most thor-
ough attempt to put these scandals together;
reveal exactly what happened, and explain
why these scandals won‘t die.

Some of you have probably heard some-
thing of this book, and before recommend-
ing it for what it says, it’s useful to dispel a
couple of misconceptions that might arise
about the book.

Stewart is not a tabloid reporter looking
for dirt. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1988 for
reporting on the stock market crash and in-
sider trading, which he followed up with the
#1 New York Times best-seller Den of
Thieves, and served as the front-page editor
of The Wall Street Journal This ﬁnancial
expertise makes him uniquely qualiﬁed to

sort out the mess of the Whitewater Devel-
opment Company and Madison Guaranty
S&L.

This book is not an unsolicited tell-all.
Stewart began this book at the Clintons
behest, and they quickly promised full coop-
eration. Revealingly, after an initial meet-
ing that Stewart had with Hillary Clinton,
this cooperation never materialized, al-
though Stewart interviewed many key ﬁg-
ures in the thick of the scandals for the ﬁrst
time.

As Stewart’s background might tell you,
this book is a complete and detailed look at
the scandals revolving around the Clinton
administration. Those looking for a hatchet
job on the Clintons andthose looking for an
apologia on their behalf are both likely to be
disappointed.

By contrast, if you’re intrigued by the at-
mosphere surrounding these scandals, if you
want to know what the fuss is all about, or
if you’d like to get a little insight into key
ﬁgures of the Clinton administration and the
workings of the media, this book is for you.

Stewart does not suddenly unearth a
smoking gun, and he gives little credit to
many of the more popular conspiracy theo-
ries surrounding Foster’s death and other
administrative events. This has allowed the
Clintons to attempt to dismiss Stewart’s
work as old news, but they are wrong in do-
ing so. While this book does relate the facts
and’ many details of the scandals, it is ulti-
mately about more than that.

This book revolves around people, creat-
ing a very readable, if intricate, story It
gives a rare glimpse at a clannishArkansas
political culture, a relentlessly digging me-

dia, and a Washington atmosphere where,
as Vince Foster wrote, “ruining people is
considered a sport.” And it exposes the at-
titudes of key ﬁgures on all sides, with  1-
plications that the Clintons should haﬁly
be proud of.

The illegality of many of the issues sur-
rounding Whitewater is a complex mat er
for which the only deﬁnitive answer will
come from independent counsel Ken Star1’s
investigation. But the unethical nature of
many of the dealings involved and of the
Clinton’s private lives is clear.

While Bill and Hillary Clinton cam-
paigned against the ‘80s as the “Decade of

Greed,” they and their associates engaged ’

in the same pursuits. As the Clintons re-
peatedly professed innocence and wondered
why the media didn’t just accept presiden-
tial proclamations without question, they
and their associates blocked information in-
quiries, changed their stories repeatedly
and in some cases, blatantly lied.

In the end, James B. Stewart’s Blood

Sport should serve as a call to theAmeri- V

can people to think about exactly what kind
of people should lead our country It doesn’t
pretend to equate Whitewater with
Watergate. But neither does it attempt to
disguise the Clinton’s careless, immoral,
and unethical behavior that they, particu-
larly Hillary, imperially believe should be
disregarded.

Are we prepared to answer these tough
questions, or have we all, like the Clintons,
become “deeply enmeshed in a Washington
culture so inured to partisan distortion and

spin that truth is the most frightening pros-

pect of all?”

with us. He’s a senior and
has retired from the fast-paced,
high-pressure world of humor
columnists. The idyllic world we
know as Dream Land, full of Lee-
Hi waitresses, seances, and
Hollins formals, is no more. I
suppose now would be a good
time for me to write a tribute to
Richard, but what can I say that
hasn’t been said a thousand
times before? What could I say
that hasn’t been written about
in La ’I‘oya Jackson songs, that
hasn’t kept us up at night, that
hasn’t torn at the depths of our
very souls?

I’ll get to the point.

From now until my own re-
tirement, my column will come
to you every single week. Terri-
fying, isn’t it? All it took was a
well-formulated argument to our
new Editorial Page Editor Jason
Zacher (I might as well start
sucking up now). The summit
between us went something like
this:

Betsy: Can I write my column
once a week? Please?

Richard Weaver is no longer

Jason: Okay.

So, right now, in addition to
the usual pressures of Spring
'I‘erm — should I wear shoes to
class, is 30 a high enough SPF
for my trip to Goshen, when does
the ABC store close and where
are my books — I have a new
pressure. I have to be funny, on
demand, twice as often as I used
to be. Yikes!

One of the worst things any-
one can do to another human
being is to introduce them to a
stranger and immediately tell
the stranger that he is funny.
Whenever that happens to me, I
stand there and smile, trying
desperately to think of some-
thing that is witty, current, so-
cially relevant, and appropriate
for the situation. Usually I tell
a stupid knock-knock joke and
escape to get a drink, thinking
that if my friend had not an-
nounced that I was funny, I
might have actually been funny
and I probably told that joke
wrong, which makes it even less
funny and now I can think of a
million more funny things I
could have said, but I would look
really dumb if I went back over
there and tried to salvage things
and I really wish I had worn

shoes to class. In short, it is hard
to be funny on demand.

Consequently, I developed a
training program over Spring
Break to put me in top comedic
condition. If you want, try to
imagine me doing these things
while “Eye of the Tiger” plays in
the background.

Monday: Slip on a banana
peel. Repeat.

Tuesday: Speed typing
drills, done wearing big yellow
duck suit.

Wednesday: Juggle rubber
chickens.

Thursday: Watch old epi-
sodes of “The Muppet Show,” “I
love Lucy,” and “Fantasy Island,”
taking copious notes. Ponder the
questions, “What is funny?”,
“How can irony be developed?”,
“How did Lucy get all those
chocolates down her blouse?”
and “Why didn’t Tattoo have a
successful ﬁlm career?”

Friday: Take ﬁeld trip to the
Palms. Do what comes natu-
rally.

Saturday: Compose lists of
things that are funny, ie: cheese.
squirrels, shaving cream, and
winter rush; and of things that
are not funny, like famine,
plague, pollution, and uncom-

Sunday: Rest.

I really hope this works, oth-

Leftover Salmon and Magraw Gap:

M.icountr)\!,~ It’s a blind hopein

,;:.Bg, Michoel Heiwletfrw
Phi Book Peviewer

You’ve seen it on CNN
and read about it in the news-
paper and the magazines.
Everybody seems obsessed
with this book, Primary Col-
ors. The only thing is that no
one knows who wrote it—
not even the power-brokers
at Random House who pub-
lished the book. lt’s simply a
novel of politics by Anony-
mous. Now, most have
pointed to George
Stephanopoulos, Mary
Matalin, and James Carville
as possible suspects. Still,
no one really knows; they’re
just guessing.

But the truth is that it does
not matter who wrote it. The
book is a good read, espe-
cially for those political buffs
out there.

The novel follows the
experiences of Henry Bur-
ton, a biracial congressional
aide and grandson of a fa-
mous civil rights activist,
who gets sucked into the
presidential campaign of
Governor Jack Stanton. He
gets behind this guy who he
thinks will make history,
someone who will make a
fundamental change in this

the possibility of what poli-
tics can deliver.

Unfortunately, as he is
dragged further into the
sewer like atmosphere of
political wheeling and deal-
ing, he realizes that although
Stanton has a connection
with people, he has some
serious ethical problems.
Scandal after scandal come
uncovered, and Burton must
reconsider his faith in the
political process and ques-
tion his racial identity and of
course, find love instead of
campaign sex.

Political pundits have
continuously pointed to how
similar the situations in the
book are to the Clinton cam-
paign.

Although it is a work of
ﬁction, many will recognize
questions of draft-dodging
and extramarital affairs as
the same questions that
dogged Clinton before he
became the “Comeback
Kid.”

No doubt that Clinton-
lovers and Clinton-haters
alikewillrelishtryingto rec-
ognize what characters rep-
resent George
Stephanopoulos, James
Carville, Bill Clinton, and
Hillary Clinton.

.. I. Furthermore, this author
knows how to weave a good
tale, a story that moves the
reader and urges him to keep
turning the page. I could not
put the book down because I
wanted to ﬁnd out what other
surprise awaited this down-
trodden campaign.

At the same time, the
book gave a greatertruth like
all great literature seeks to
do. Essentially, politics is
about figuring out who gets
what in this society. Some-
times, it’s not pretty and
surely not always ethical. If
we allow it, politics corrupts,
disintegrating our civility
and destroying our human-
ity. Instead of leading to
truths, it only leads to lies
and distortion. As the author
makes clear in this book, the
truth rarely matters. What
matters is how one can shape
facts to fit a particular
candidate’s agenda.

Of course, maybe we al-
ready knew that about poli-
tics and maybe it’s obvious.

“The play asks if it is possible for

James and the Giant Peach: not Nightmare Ill

Bg Qlex Christensen

Phi Movie Reviewer

*** 1/2 of 4 stars; more than worthy
The pitch: “It’ll be like The Nightmare Before Christ-
mas meets The Muppets Take Manhattan!”

When Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas
was released, critics raved and gushed, loving the wonder-
ful music by Danny Elfman, the ingenious story by Tim
Burton, and the intriguing, dark, visually stunning stop-
motion of Henry Selick. It was compared with The
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, The Wizard of Oz, and other
fantastic classics of the screen. Recent re-viewings cer-
tainly show that the ﬁlm is holding up under this pressure,
and is one of those ﬁlms that so captures a wide audience’s
imagination that it is an “instant classic” (Disney writes
this under the titles of all its animated features; it has not
quite been true since Aladdin).

The point of this introduction is to dispel any notion
among those who are interested in seeing James and the
Giant Peach that it is another wonderful concoction in
which Elfman, Burton, and Selick put their heads together

to create a modern classic. This is not to denigrate the ﬁlm
at all. But if anyone is expecting a ﬁlm remotely similar to
some idea of Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christ-
mas Part II: The Revenge, there is a large disappointment
waiting at the theater.

Some have referred to the ﬁlm congratulating Burton on
his dark, startling imagery, commenting on his trademark
techniques and story features, and his unique vision. But
with James, as with the horrendous summer disaster Batman
Forever, any credit or blame that is assignable to Burton is
as a producer, not a director or creative consultant. The
vision, the story, the style-all belong-to Henry Selick, and he
is due all the credit for the success of James.

As you can probably tell from the title, if you have not
already read the ubiquitous Roald Dahl book upon which
this ﬁlm is based, it is the story ofa young boy, James Henry
Trotter (Paul Terry), and his adventures with a giant peach.
If you don’t want more of a basic plot set—up than that, you
should probably skip the next paragraph.

James is trapped in a horrible life with his aunts Spiker
(Joanna Lumley of the BBC’s fabulous Absolutely Fabu-
lous and former Bond girl) and Sponge (Miriam Margolyes)
when he is approached by “The Old Man” (Pete
Postlethwaite), who offers him a sack of magic squirmy
things which, he promises, will change everything. James
drops the sack, however, and the squirmy things work their
magic on a bunch of garden bugs and a peach tree, which
produces a giant-sized peach. Magically, James is trans-

formed into a stop-motion character and enters the peach to
find the giant-sized bugs, who become his fast friends by the
time the peach rolls down the hill and theirjourney begins.

Okay, no more spoilers, you can read on now. Excellent
performances are given by nearly everyone in the ﬁlm,
though the live-action parts are the weakest and much of that
is due to Lumley and Margolyes as the evil aunts. Paul Terry
is a good actor, though, and he rescues the end of the movie
with sheer enthusiasm. During the stop-motion middle of
the ﬁlm, the voices of the characters are provided by Susan
Sarandon as Miss Spider, Simon Callow as Old Green
Grasshopper, Frasier’s Glynis Johns as the Ladybug, David
Thewlis as Earthworm, Richard Dreyfuss as Caterpillar and
Margolyes as Glowworm. Sarandon, especially, adds a
mystery and menace remarkable for a completely vocal
performance. Dreyfuss is largely wasted. His awkward,
loud Brooklynaccent could have been done better by any
number of actors and come off as less annoying.

There is the sense, as well, that this is a very abridged,
musicalized version of Dahl’s book, and this is true.

It means that much of the delightful conversation from
the book is cut, minimizing the characterization of the bugs
and so a lot ofthe emotional impact. lt’s not a fatal flaw, but
it is a ﬂaw.

Also, there is a storytelling incompleteness: there should
probably have been one more big stop-motion adventure
episode to “round out” the structure. lfyou have not read the
book, you should probably see the ﬁlm ﬁrst and then

appreciate how much richerthe book is. If you have read the
book, do not hold the movie to the book’s strictures.

But what really stuns about James are the visuals. The
landscape is totally believable during the stop-motion seg-
ments (the live-action sets are less so). Combining com-
puter animation, blue-screen effects, stop-motion, and live-
action, James is sometimes blindingly good-looking. Where
it falls down is in trying to make the live-action setting recall
the stop-motion setting. Selick solves this problem by
ignoring it, to the detriment of the ﬁlm.

James ultimately is a success, but for reasons much
different than those which made Nightmare a success.
While it is true that James is much darker than the usual
children’s movie, it is nowhere near the dark vision of
Nightmare.

This film also succeeds largely in spite of its music, while
Nightmare was decidedly a musical. In the end, the two
films are so dissimilar that too much comparison is point-
less. This ﬁlm is Selick’s vision while Nightmare was
clearly Burton’s.

A couple of things to look for: one character from The
Nightmare Before Christmas does brieﬂy return, but it is not
nearly as cheesy as that little sentence makes it sound. And
stay after the credits: it’s not hard since Randy Newman’s
catchiest tune of the movie, “Good News,” is playing, and
there is a short live-action bit at the end of the movie which,
though not brilliant, is worth staying for since the ticket has
already been bought.

Wind ensemble travels
to Japan during break

BY JENNIFER MENDOCHA
PHI NEWS STAFF WRITER

What did you do over spring break?
Work on the tan in some tropical para-
dise? W&L’s Wind Ensemble, directed
by Dr. Barry Kolman, had the unique
opportunity to tour Kyushu, Japan. the
group played three concerts, and did a
lot of sight-seeing. Though a language
barrier existed for most Wind Ensemble
students and their host families, they
managed to bridge the gap by “commu-
nicating through music” (the immortal
words of W&L’s Computing Specialist
and tuba player, Stephen Cole).

Hapless members of the Wind En-
semble were thankful that Japanese
scholars Beth Arthur and Matt Socha
were able to utilize their language skills
to extricate the group from various pre-
dicaments. Socha commented, “I was
amazed by the generous special treat-
ment I received from people I’ve never
met, probably due to the fact that I was

eager to learn and use their language.”
He was “touched by the warmth of the
Japanese host families,” especially with

regard to their sensitivity in trying to-

make their American guests feel at
home. He also marveled that “school

children wanted to get their pictures

taken with us just because we were
Americans.”

Sophomore Jeremy Adams found
his host family very hospitable and
accomodating, although he, along with
many members of the group, expressed
a certain degree of frustration with the
ubiquity of meals based on fish. It
therefore came as no surprise that, on
the home trip, the pizza and french fry
vendors at the L.A. International Air-
port terminal did a booming business.

Rachel Goddu added that, “It was
a wonderful experience.” She was also
impressed that, after such a short stay,
the host families were able to display
sincere regret at the departure of their
American guests.

trong performances in the

S throwing events and the dis-

tance runs, not to mention a memory,
helped the Washington and Lee track
squads to solid ﬁnishes at the ODAC
Championship at Roanoke College on
Saturday.

The women’s team placed second

0 behind Lynchburg with a score of 62

and the men’s team ﬁnished third be-
hind Lynchburg and Bridgewater with
53 points at the meet.

The men started off slowly in the

1 sprints and hurdles, failing .to place in

the top two of any of the ﬁve events.
Senior Nick Polizzi placed twice in
the hurdling events, ﬁnishing ﬁfth in
the 110 meter high hurdles and third in

« the 400 meter hurdles.

The Generals fared much better in
the distance runs. Junior Sandy Hooper
breezed to victory in the 800 meter run
in a time of 1:57.61. Sophomore Tay-
lor Shultz ﬁnished behind Hooper with
a 2:00.33, good for third place.

Senior Brad Paye and sophomore
Jason Callen grabbed a second place
ﬁnish in the 1500 meter run and 5000
meter run, respectively. Paye ran a
time of4:05.10 in the 1500 and Callen
crossed the line in 16:03.46 in the
5000.

Both the 4x400 and the 4x100 relay
teams placed third for the Generals.

Freshman Marc Granger and
sophomore Omar Moneim teamed up

to give the Generals an impressive
showing in the throwing events.
Granger and Moneim ﬁnished one-
two in the shot put as Granger threw a
40-9 1/2 and Moneim recorded a 40-6
1/4 heave. Lynchburg’s Joe Bedard,
who placed in eight events, finished
third.

Moneim also picked up a fourth
place showing in the javelin and
Granger placed ﬁfth in the discus.

Senior Harris Morrison continued
to be a force in the pole vault as he
gave the men their final victory of the
day. Morrison vaulted a height of 13-
6, six inches better than runner—up
Mike Dickerson of Bridgewater.

On the women’s side, it was the
Natasha and Josephine show in the
distance runs. Freshman Natasha
Dorofeeva smashed the school record
in the 800 meter run with her time of
2:23.97, which was nearly five sec-
onds faster than the runner—up.

Senior Josephine Schaefferwas her
usual dominant self as she captured
both the 1500 and 3000 meter runs.
While she cruised to victory in the
3000, topping teammate Carson Flow-

ers with a time of 10:38.40, her ODAC-

record-breaking win in the 1500 of-
fered plenty of drama.

Schaeffer said she gets very
“stressed” each time she runs the 1500.

“It really isn’t my best race and it
takes a lot out of me mentally and
physically,” she said.

Accustomed to leading the pack
throughout most of her races, Schaeffer
found herself in the unlikely position

of playing catch—up as Lynchburg’s
Melissa Beaver passed her late in the
1500. With only about200 meters left
in herﬁnal ODAC Championship race,
Schaeffer knew it was time to put on
the burners. One thing was bothering
her, though.

Schaeffer said the scenario re-
minded her of her junior and senior
years in high school when she was
frustrated by an opposing runner she
encountered who always seemed to
pass her with about 200 meters left in
a race.

“That’s what was going through
my mind when [Beaver] passed me.”

But the senior would not continue
to let the memory haunt her. She
rallied to pass Beaver and win the race
with her record time of 4:55.40, more
than two seconds better than her
Lynchburg opponent.

“I was surprised at my kick,”
Schaeffer said. ‘‘I don’t know where it
came from, but it came from some-
where.”

Junior Nat Messmore also per-
formed admirably in the distance races,
finishing third in the 1500 and fourth
in the 3000.

Senior Hollis Leddy looked good
in the shorter distances, placing third
in the 200 meters in 27.73 and second
in the 400 meters in 1:02.52.

Despite his fantastic year for the Gener-

the the number-one singles position head-

The senior disposed of the number-two

W&L looks to capture eighth straight Lee-Jackson title *  

BY BETHANY BAUMAN
PHI SPORTS EDITOR

l he Washington and Lee

men’s lacrosse team hopes
to‘cap off its season with a win at
Saturday’s Lee-Jackson La-
crosse Classic against the
Keydets of the Virginia Military
Institute.

The Generals have been frus-
trated over the past few weeks.
They’ve lost three of their last
five games, including a triple
overtime 10-9 defeat by Denison
and an 12-11 overtime loss to
ODAC rival Roanoke College.

Last Saturday, 11th—ranked
W&L faced the 6th-ranked
Shoremen of Washington Col-
lege at Wilson Field.

Washington College cameout
strong, scoring early in the first

quarter. The Generals trailed 3-
1 until senior attack Ande
Jenkins scored early in the sec-
ond quarter.

The score stayed at 3-2 until
Washington ’s George Atterbury
and John Fuller scored goals in
the final 2:22 of the first half to
post a 5-2 Shoremen lead at half-
time.

Atterbury scored
Washington’s first two goals of
the second half, starting a 7-1
Shoremen run that left the Gen-
erals with a 10-3 deficit early in
the fourth quarter.

The Shoremen went on to
take the game 15-5.

But the Generals regrouped
before going into their last
ODAC game of the season
against the Yellow Jackets of
Randolph-Macon College on
Wednesday.

Senior attackman Russell
Croft led W&L, scoring four
goals to take the now 12th-
ranked Generals over Randolph-
Macon.

W&L netted the first four
goals of the game and was lead-
ing Randolph-Macon 11-1 be-
fore the Jackets scored three
straight in the third quarter.

The Generals got a lot of
help at goal from junior Chris
TeStrake, who made ten saves,
seven of them in the first half.

W&L moved to a 9-5 overall
record with the 15-6 win and
finished second in the ODAC at
5-1.

The Generals will conclude
their season by hosting VMI on
Saturday in the 9th Annual Lee-
Jackson Lacrosse Classic.

Senior Adam Butterworth
said, “lt's one of my favorite
games to play in...The fans re-
ally get into the rivalry.”

The first Lee-Jackson game
was played at Wilson Field in
1988 when the Generals fell to
the Keydets 15-9.

W&Lhassincewon all seven
Classics, but the games have be-
come increasingly competitive
over the past few years, with the
last two matchups decided by

three goals or less.

VMI head lacrosse coach
Doug Bartlett said that there
were only two things that he
could predict for Saturday; the
game will start at 2pm and he’ll
be celebrating after the game,
regardless of the Keydets’ per-
formance, because it will be his
daughter’s second birthday.

On the more serious side,
Bartlett hopes that the Keydets
will be able to overcome the
inconsistency that has plagued
the team during their 6-7 sea-
son.

Bartlett said, “We’ve got to
be able to put together the best
quarters of the different games
we’ve played this season.”

W&L head coach Jim
Stagnitta also hopes to have his
team finish off the season on a
positive note.

He would like to see the Gen-
erals shooting the ball better,
taking advantage of the offense
that they’ve been able to gener-
ate all season.

“There’s a lot of excitement
surrounding this game...and a
lot of incentive for the players.
You can throw the records out.”

There will be a new tradition
added to the Lee-Jackson Clas-

sic this year. A most valuable
player will be selected from each
team to be the recipients of the
Worrell-Fallon Memorial Award.

The award is named after
DeWitt Worrell and Gary Fallon,
two men who helped close the
gap between Washington and
Lee, VMI, and the community
before their tragic deaths.

Worrell was an outstanding
athlete, starring in football, bas-
ketball, and track at VMI.

After graduating in 1962, he
continued his involvement with
VMI, serving on the Keydet Club
Board of Governors and the Board
of Visitors. Worrell also acted as
an advisor to the VMI athletic
department.

Gary Fallon coached the Gen-
erals football program from 1978
until his death in April of 1995.

Fallon was a standout athlete
in football, wrestling, and lacrosse
for the Orangemen during his
career at Syracuse University.

After graduating in 1962, he
began a professional football ca-
reer with the Minnesota Vikings,
Hamilton Tiger Cats, and Toronto
Argonauts.

Fallon went back to Syracuse
to get his masters in special edu-
cation, and after graduating in

The Generals prevailed over the Keydets, 11-8, in last year’s
Lee-Jackson Lacrosse Classic, held at VMI.

1967, he began his coaching
career.

In 1978, Fallon arrived in
Lexington to coach the Gener-
als. During this time he was
also a top-rated lacrosse offi-
cial and worked several NCAA

playoff games.
In his sixteen years at W&L,
Fallon accumulated the

winningest record in Generals
football history, and more im-
portantly, had a lasting impres-

who played for him.

The inscription on the plaque
reads, “This award honors the
memory of DeWitt Worrell

(VMI ‘62) and Gary Fallon .

(W&L Football Coach 1978-
95)—Men deeply dedicated to
their families, their faith, their
universities, the game of la-

and to which they contributed so

sion on the hundreds of men significantly.”

The Generals havejust com-

16-11 overall with a stellar 1 1-5
record in the ODAC. All these
improvements are the mark ofa
team with a mission.

While all the collegians were
at the beach, on vacation orjust
living it up on spring break, the
Generals compiled a 4-2 record
during their April 13-21 hiatus.

The team travelled north to

dropped the first game but took
the second behind the pitching
of Bob Weston.

Two days later, the Generals

Women sweep all nine
events for first time in
ODAC history to win
sixth straight tennis title

BY JASON ZACHER
PHI STAFF WRITER

I he W&L women’s tennis team swept the ODAC tournament
last weekend, not dropping a set en route to their sixth straight
ODAC title.

Led by ODAC Player of the Year, Natalia Garcia, the Generals
completed the first perfect sweep of all nine events in ODAC
history.

Garcia captured the No. 1 singles title 6-2, 6-1 over Guilford
College’s Betsey Parker.

She was followed by sophomores Ericka Shapard and Berry
Blankinship in the No. 2 and No. 3 slots. Shapard defeated
Guilford’s Libby Hinsley 6-0, 7-6 and Blankinship took down
Mignon Ezzell 6-4, 7-5.

Senior Shelley Sunderman did not drop a game as she picked up
her fourth ODAC title 6-0, 6-0 over Guilford’s Jen Wolos.

Senior Julie Ayers captured her third straight ODAC title as she
defeated Sarah Woodard 6-0, 6-4.

Freshman Mary Celeste Foster followed suit and won her first
ODAC singles title.

In doubles action, the Generals continued to dominate. The No.
1 team of Ayers and Garcia won in straight sets, as did the No. 2
team of Shapard and Blankinship, and the No. 3 team of Foster and

Sunderman.

Next week, the Generals head to Kalamazoo, Michigan to
compete in the NCAA Division III Tournament.

The Generals have the fourth seed, and will play Sewanee in the
first round. The Generals defeated Sewanee 6-3 during the regular

season.

Baseball prepares for first
ODAC tourney in five years

Despite the defeat, the Gener-
als remained in the hunt for an
ODAC playoff berth. The team
ventured to Greensboro, NC to
challenge the dwellers of the
ODAC cellar, Guilford College
in two key games on April 21st.

Backed by the pitching of
Ermigiotti, Weston and the clutch
relief performances of closer Matt
Reedy, the Generals took two
from the Quakers. 9-3 and 8-7.
Now,the Generalscould consider
themselve serious contenders for
a trip to Lynchburg City Stadium
for the playoffs.

Tuesday the 23rd, the Gener-
als invaded Harrisonburg to chal-
lengethe Eastern Mennonite Roy-
als for the fourth seed in the
ODAC tournament. A one-hour
rain delay only prolonged the
agony for the Royals who fell to
the Generals 7-4. Rob Boston
went the distance for the victory.

Last Thursday, the high-pow-
ered offense of Lynchburg settled
into Smith Field to keep their
ODAC tournament hopes alive.
But, the Generals had no sympa-
thy for the Hornets, defeating
them 14-1.

Matt Ermigiotti continued his
superb pitching to move to 6-2 on
the year, tyingthe team record for
victories. At this point, the Gen-

erals were playoff-bound.

rival of the Randolph-Macon

to form predictions of what would
be important in the case and what
its outcome may entail. With re-
spect to the case, Massie stated that
there is a strong argument against
single sex education at VMI, com-
menting that it will probably be
more difficult to provide a solution
for the equality crisis than it will be
to decide the case itself. Ides was

Storm crashes alumni party

BY DAVE BALSLEY
PHI STAFF WRITER

he tent housing last Saturday’s

concert for the Class of ’71

fell victim to the strong gusts
of wind accompanying a summer
stonn. The tent partially collapsed
when spikes anchoring one of its sides
were torn from the ground.

On Saturday, May 4, W&L’s Class
of ’71 planned to celebrate their re-
union by enjoying dinner and a con-
cert on the baseball ﬁelds. The Coast-
ers, the Drifters, and the Marvellettes
were scheduled to appear, and a large
tent, suitable to the size of the affair,
had been erected to house the dinner
and concert.

The other returning classes were

, invited to attend as well, and Robert

W.H. Mish, Associate Director of
Alumni Programs, noted that both stu-
dents and residents of Lexington ar-
rived at the field in the hopes of attend-
ing the concert.

After the alumni dinner, the Coast-
ers took the stage. Shortly thereafter,
“a huge gust of wind came and started
rocking the tent,” Mish stated. “Huge
sixty foot poles in the middle were
swaying.” The strong winds tore the
stakes which supported one side of the
tent from the ground, causing the tent
to partially collapse.

Mike Young, Director of Security,
determined that it would be unsafe to
attempt to continue the concert on the
baseball fields. The celebrations were
moved to the local Howard Johnson.
The three bands who scheduled for the
evening delighted their audience by
performing a cappella renditions of
their songs at the hotel, treating every-
one to a special version of “Good

Night, Sweetheart” in which all three
groups performed together.

According to Mish, the evening’s
attendants pulled together to turn an
otherwise horrible situation into a great
time. The unusual situation plans
helped achieve a great success, bring-
ing together the alumni in a bonding
celebration.

“From our standpoint,” Mish re-
marked, “it was still successful.” This
sentiment was echoed by the alumni
who enjoyed themselves so much that
they proposed to have another party

next year, complete with the gust of
wind.

In fact, plans have already been
made to host a similar party next year.
The Coasters, the Drifters and the
Marvellettes have already agreed to
re-appear on W&L+s campus again
next year. Certain aspects of last
Saturday’s festivities will be notice-
ably absent from the planned reunion,
however. Mish commented that they
probably will not take the risk of host-
ing the event on the baseball field a
second time.

W&L Dance anticipates first performance

BY ROBIN SI~:AToN
PHI STAFF WRITER

ashington and Lee’s new
dance troupe, W&L
Dance, will hold its first

performance on Sunday, May 12th at
8 p.m., in the I..enfest Center’sJohnson
Theatre. The program, which includes
a wide variety of pieces, from classi-
cal ballet to funky jazz, is the culmina-
tion of a year’s work for the dancers.
This free performance is open to the
public.

Missy Smithgall of Glasgow cho-
reographed three ballet pieces for the
performance. One of her original
pieces, entitled “Ave Maria,” will fea-
ture graduating senior Margaret Fitts.
Set to the music of Johann Sebastian
Bach, the piece will be part of Fitts’
final performance in the Lexington
area.

Fitts began dance instruction at age
three and has taken ballet classes in
the area throughout her W&L career.
She also assisted Smith gall by helping
to organize the ballet ensemble’s re-
hearsals and leading some sessions.
Of the newly-organized dance pro-
gram on campus, Fitts says, “W&L
needs this,” and she encourages those
involved in theatre and other areas of

the performing arts on campus to take

advantage of the opportunity.
Smithgall also adapated choreog-
raphy from Petipa, added to her own,
to create “Minkus Variations.” In
addition to Smithgall and Fitts, the
pointe variations feature freshmen
Leah Hall and Sarah Moore, sopho-
more Robin Seaton, and guest dancer

The finale in Sunday’s program
will be a 17-minute ballet entitled
“Rhapsody in Blue.” Choreography
is also by Smithgall, and the music of
the same name isby George Gershwin.
The piece will feature all members of
the ballet ensemble.

Smithgall teaches classical ballet
technique and pointe both for the W&L
ballet ensemble and within the com-
munity. Beginning her ballet instruc-
tion in Pennsylvania at age three,
Smithgall started intensive training at
the age of six at schools including the
School of the Joffrey Ballet and the
School of the Pennsylvania Ballet.

She began performing at an early
age with such groups as the Bux-Mont
Dance Theatre, the Dance Theatre of

Pennsylvania, Dance Del Bello and
Dance Elite. Smithgall’s past instruc-
tors include Victor Moreno, Gloria
Govrin, Michael Loupasanski, Lupe
Serrano, and Cherie Noble.

Upon moving to Rockbridge
County in early 1991, Smithgall be-.
gan teaching and performing with the
Rockbridge Ballet. Her past perfor-
mances include principals roles in most
of the major classical ballets and fea-
ture roles in original ballets.

Washington and Lee students
Cheryl Puzon, Kathy Dussé, and Chris-
tine Bragg also choreographed jazz
and lyrical pieces for the program.
Puzon, a sophomore, created two
pieces, “Funk-O-MegaMix” and “Kiss
From a Rose.” Puzon has two years of
jazz training, and she also participated

in her high school dance team for three
years.

“Total Eclipse of the Heart” will be
a solo number featuring sophomore
choreographer Kathy Dussé. Dussé’s
background includes nine yearsof bal-
let and jazz instruction.

Freshman Christine Bragg also cho-
reographed a piece for the perfor-
mance. Bragg, a sixteen-year student
of ballet and jazz, will perform “Ubiq-
uitous Mr. Love Grove” during the
Sunday evening exhibition.

Sophomore Dana Hood and fresh-
man Heather Bradley are also mem-
bers of the jazz ensemble and will
dance Sunday night.

Those interested in Sunday’s per-
formance or classes may contact
Smithgall at 540-258-1516.

Letters to the Editor

Midshipmen
ashamed

Paul Saboe’s “Absolut Tradition,”
editorial in the 3 May Ring-tum Phi
prompts me to comment since it in-
volves my alma matter, the U.S. Naval
Academy, and Washington and Lee
University, where I have had the privi-
lege to serve since 1976.

During the period of June 4-5, I
will return to Annapolis for my 50th
reunion with great pride. But like
many graduates of the Naval Acad-
emy, I am deeply concerned and most
disturbed with the recent turn of events
that go to the very heart of the institu-
tion. The reasons therefore must be
corrected. If not, the Academy will
have betrayed the many graduates who
have made the U.S. Navy and Marine
Corps the ﬁnest of ﬁghting forces, and
it will cease to exist as an institution
worthy of the trust it has so long en-
joyed.

I will not take issue with the com-
ments concerning Professor James
Barry nor the “bilging” of classmates
because they are beyond the scope of

“there have ap-

peared chinks

in the systems
armor.”

this commentary. But I will take issue
with the comments that the vital sense
of honor no longer exists at the Acad-
emy. In support, Ioffer, from personal
contact, the expressions of utter dis-
gust on part of the vast majority of
midshipmen for the violations of rules
and regulations of the Academy plus
the breaking of state and federal laws
by the few.

What are the causes of the break-
down in the system? It is my opinion
that the Naval Academy does not op-
erate under the strict discipline of ear-
lier years. Too many offences that
were cause for immediate dismissal
receive the Nelson’s blind eye treat-
ment and the guiltymay “get away
with it” in this litigious society. The
Naval Academy cannot be like civil-
ian universities because its mission is
to prepare the graduates for participa-
tion in combat should the need arise.
There is no other reason for the exist-
ence of the service academies. In
preparing the prospective officers,

i honor and truth have to be inviolate
, because they are the most important
5 aspects of military and human en-
 deavor, failure to know the truth can
I lead to disasters of immense propor-
1 tion.

Closer to home - the honor system

 of Washington and Lee. It is one of the
 major selling points of the school. In

recent years there have appeared
chinks in the system’s armor. Let me
cite an incident that occurred several
years ago when a W&Lstudent struck
and killed a fellow student with his
automobile. He kept silent for almost
a year before his identity came to
light. Three of his fraternity brothers
knew of it but chose to remain silent.
In the trial where the student pleaded
guilty, the judge said the following to
the man after his plea: “This is a mark
against you, your associates, and the
institution where you attended. This
tragedy is a low point for an institu-
tion known for its honor and integrity.
This tragedy is complicated by the
attempts to cover up the truth.”

Unless these chinks are removed
and the new armor reburnished, the
very lifeblood of Washi ngton and Lee
will slowly ebb away. All agree this
must be avoided. But how?

Very simply, we can do General
Lee no greater honor than to live by
his code that extends to all parts of our
lives and not just those restricted to
campus classrooms. Be mindful of
the fact that the keystone of honor is
obedience to lawful authority. Also
be mindful of another of Marse
Robert’s tenets. For every right there
is a duty. To be true to this patron
saint, I think it important to ask one-
self before taking any action in any
instance if it will bring honor to you,
your family, the University and the
United States of America. If the an-
swer is in the negative, halt, rethink
and only press on if the green afﬁrma-
tive light says go.

We are privileged to be part of an
institution with a great tradition. Make
the most of it for without the Honor
System Washington and Lee is just
another small southern college. It
need not happen and pray that it does
not. The matter is in your hands.

poor judgement

ing from the "Letters" page of The
Trident never ceases to amaze me.
The Trident printed, apparently with-
out reservation, the letter-to-the-edi-
tor entitled "Student says that most
W&L Women are Lesbians." The
letter served no purpose and was, most
of all, completely incorrect. Even in
jest, this letter represented a pathetic
attempt at humor. One must wonder
though . . . you guys will run a letter
like this, but refused to run the G&L

s Republicans prepare to
tackle other ﬁscal year, one
of the areas in which

. they differ most from the Clinton ad-
Again, the absolute crap emanat- --

ministration continues to be national
defense policy. The crux of the dis-
pute lies in the belief of congressional
Republicans that America's defense
policy must undergo some policy
changes in order to prepare for the
beginning of the 21st century.
Philosophically, there can be little
doubt that defense must remain the
key policy of government.
Government’s ﬁrst duty, which the
Declaration of Independence pro-
claimed, has always been to protect
the lives of its citizens. Without life
and liberty, social welfare policy is a
luxury citizens cannot afford.
Nonetheless, that philosophical
commitment leaves many practical
questions of defense policy open to
debate, so here are three of the key
arenas where Republicans in Congress
will clash with the White House.
The ﬁrst concerns the overall lev-
els of defense spending. Democrats
have leveled charges of pork and ex-
cessive defense spending against Re-
publicans, but such charges fall apart
under careful scrutiny.
As Democratic Senator Daniel

Inouye recently wrote in an article for
Roll Call, forfiscal year 1997, defense
spending will be only 15.1% of fed-
eral spending, an 8% decrease since
1980 and half the level of 1950. By
comparison, uncontrolled social
spending on entitlements like Medi-
care and Social Security dwarfs this
level of funding, and Republicans even
drew ﬂak for suggesting that the
growth of Medicare should be reduced
to a mere 6.5%. g

The president’s budget provides
less than two-thirds of what Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John
Shalikashvili declared must be spent
on procurement and modernization and
falls woefully short in other basic ar-
eas like housing maintenance for per-
sonnel. The Joint Chiefs’ 1996 Force
Readiness Assessment concluded sol-
emnly, “We can no longer afford to
push procurement into the outyears.”

The second area is missile defense.
A quick look at the world situation
provides ample justification for the
expansion of these programs, as well
as for maintaining vigilance by ad-
equately funding the Defense Depart-
ment.

Nuclear proliferation poses the
greatest threat of the 21st Century to
U.S. security. Russia is currently ac-
tively marketing “converted” SS-25
intercontinental ballistic missiles as
satellite launch vehicles to any nation
willing to pay the price. The CIA
veriﬁed earlier this year that China
violated U.S. law by passing nuclear
technology to Pakistan. And intelli-
gence reports that North Korea’s own
missile program may have the capa-

bility to hit the U.S. as early as 2000.

Accidental attacks remain as seri-
ous a risk as rogue attacks. Russia’s
military is demoralized and poorly
organized, thanks to massive
underfunding. Furthermore, intelli-
gence agencies admit the oft-cited
platitude that Russia's missiles are no
longer pointed at U.S. targets cannot
be veriﬁed.

This new world situation makes a
missile defense system more needed
and feasible. Congressman Curt
Weldon, the chairman of the National

“We can no
longer afford

to push pro-
curement into
the outyears. ”

Security subcommittee on research and
development, reports that the Penta-
gon has stated that a system capable of
defending the U.S. against a limited
attack could be produced in the next
several years for around $5 billion, not
the hundreds of billions that missile
defense critics routinely charge.

And in view of President Clinton’s
recent commitment to increase U.S.
aid for Israeli missile defense sys-
tems, one has to wonderwhy the Presi-
dent thinks missile defense is good
enough for Israel but not for the Ameri-
can public.

Finally our defense plans for the
future must ﬁnd a reasonable way of
limiting the costs of peacekeeping and N
other contingency operations.

President Clinton’s repeated com-
mitments to these unbudgeted opera-
tions in places of questionable na-
tional interest like Bosnia and Haiti
cost U.S. taxpayers more than $4 bil-
lion in 1995, money that comes from
other needed defense programs. At
the same time, the President’s budget )
underfunds the National Guard and

" military"reserves, despite their huge

contributions to such operations.

While isolationism is not the an-
swer, this spend first, ask questions *
later policy cannot continue. The Presi-
dent must develop a coherent foreign
policy based on national interest that
can reduce such expenditures. 5‘,

Senator Inouye recalled the detri-
mental ﬁnancial and security effects
of the hasty demobilization after World
War II that left the U.S. unprepared for
the following war in Korea. He cited a
Army General Matthew Ridgeway’s
observation after that war that, “Our
armed forces had been economized
almost to ineffectiveness."

Jubilance over the end of the Cold i
War is understandable, but we cannot
let such feelings cause us to neglect
our national defense or ignore critical
world threats to U.S. security. We A
should follow the policy of peace
through strength that kept America
safe for more than 40 years in the
face of such danger. The security
of our nation is too important to *
the U.S. to ever be caught asleep
on the watch.

hey listen,” Nathan Sheppard Band drummer Mike

Rizzi says of W&L partygoers.

The students that have jammed to the Nathan

Sheppard Band have indeed listened, and they’ve liked
what they’ve heard.

As a result of W&L’s enthusiastic reception, the band
has played here again and again throughout the year.

“Fratemities parties aren’t supposed to be fun” for
bands, Rizzi laughs, but the combination of the Nathan
Sheppard Band and Washington and Lee seems to have
produced nothing but “fun”—for student and musician
alike.

Says Rizzi, “We’re always ready to get to Lexington.”

The story of how the Nathan Sheppard Band came to be
begins in Georgia with one gifted acoustic musician and
three members of a night-job band.

That one musician is of course the band’s namesake,
Nathan Sheppard, who had established himself as an
acoustic artist in Athens for almost a decade when some-
one with a good ear arranged a meeting for him with the
talented bass player, guitarist, and drummer from one
crumbling local band.

The four men just got together for a few jam sessions,
and liked they sound they made.

The local band fell apart, but the new band that formed
is where our story interests itself, a band whose sound has
attracted the interest of record labels and fans across the
South and beyond.

Adjectives do not come easy to describe the sound of the
Nathan Sheppard Band, though—-not even for the band
members.

“lt’s a sound you can’t really describe,” Rizzi explains.

First of all, I am not a mother, but being achild (yes even
at 20, my mother still considers me her baby—nevermind
she has 6 other “children” to worry about) does qualify me
to comment on the whole “Mother’s Day” phenomenon
sweeping this campus.

I know you are thinking to yourself, “phenomenon? I
wouldn’t call Mother’s Day a phenomenon.” Well disal-
lowing my propensity for hyperbole, stay with me for a
second. It is truly amazing that this simple Sunday gets so
much attention. I mean I know there is a Grandparent’s
Day, Father’s Day, Groundhog’s Day, Founder’s Day
President’s Day, basically a whole mess of days denoted to
celebrate something. But Mother’s day brings out the best
in our Washington and Lee Students.

Walking around campus this week I have heard pleasant
exchanges between fraternity brothers as follows;

First Guy: So man Mother’s Day is Sunday

Second Guy: No, Really?

First Guy: Yeah, I’m thinking I should send a card.

Second Guy: My dad usually gets ﬂowers, and signs my
name next to his so I’m covered.

First Guy: Cool.

This may not seem that enlightening, but stop and think
how considerate and caring these gentlemen appear in this
particular conversation. This just proves how wonderful
the men at this school have the potential to be, maybe
pointing this out will stop the tide of women who have lost
hope in men, and are turning to other women for the
comfort and love they seek (obligatory Trident Lesbian
reference.) Gentlemen, go spend that 32 cents and mail
your mother a card, it'll be well worth it.

I.

Sister Helen ponders the death penalty.

While Nathan Sheppard himself brings to re-
hearsal rough ideas for songs—music and lyr-
ics—-each member contributes to the song writ-
ing process, adding ideas and helping to create
the final product. That participation means that
every song the band performs is the result of
four accomplished musicians of four different
backgrounds and many different inﬂuences.

Hard put to fit the band within the.Age of
Modern Rock, Rizzi suggests such descriptions
as “folk rock,” “alternative” or “progressive,”
although he’s not too enthusiastic about any
particular label.

There are traces of many different bands in
the sounds of the Nathan Sheppard Band. Rizzi
points to Donovon and Bob Dylan; I would add
Toad the Wet Sprocket and R.E.M. I‘

Whatever other bands and whatever styles
the band may recall, “the chemistry works,”
Rizzi says, which fact is the most important, after
all.

Having toured for a year, the band has been
energetically putting music out.

Their first compact disc, Wandering, is now in its last
stage’ of printing and within a few days their new album
Halflife will be available.

Consisting of 10 songs recorded live and three in a studio
environment, Halflife offers fans all unreleased songs.

play.”
Well, the Nathan Sheppard Band might well be our
favorite band to listen to.

in the Tom Cruise/Julia Roberts/Susan Sarandon role, we have Richard Gere, steeped
in corruption from the beginning, not innocent of the ways in which justice is
administered, who somehow finds a way to redeem himself. Most of the action takes
place between two people in small, enclosed spaces, or in the courtroom. Somehow,
director Gregory Hoblit manages to sustain the audience’s interest anyhow, often
stunningly.

A lot of the criticism of Richard Gere is that he always plays the same character.
He is basically a “hair actor” like MichaeliDouglas‘-—-once you see his hairstyle, you
know all the intricacies of his character. I disagree with this assessment of Gere.
Anyone who has seen Mike Figgis’s Internal Affairs knows that Gere is capable of
real depth. And yet, in F irstKnight, Sommersby, Pretty Woman, and others, Gere has
only given us blandly good-looking heroes without a trace of realism. Which is odd,
because when Gere is good, he is pretty damn good. In Primal Fear, he is pretty damn
good.

His character is Martin Vail, a defense attorney who sees a shot at the really big
time when an altar boy is accused of killing the archbishop of Chicago. He offers to
defend the accused killer, Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), pro bono. This involves
him in an actually not very complicated web of intrigue and deceit which gradually
unwinds itself.

The fun of the film is all in the rhythm and the interaction of the characlers.
Unfortunately, even with a high-powered cast including Laura Linney, Frances
McDormand, Andre Braugher, John Mahoney, and Maura Tierney, there are really
only two characters in Primal Fear: Gere’s Vail and first-time film actor Norton’s
Stampler. So they have to sustain a lot. Fortunately, both are up to the task.

Gere plays Vail as a character who acts completely despicably, always scramblirag
for advantage. And he enjoys being as slick as he is. And yet, there is an underlying
optimism, if not idealism, that give the portrayal depth. This performance is really
very well modulated and manages to capture something about Vail that makes you
believe in him.

And as Gere said of Edward Norton, he “is emerging as one of the monster actors
of our time.” After only one ﬁlm? Yep. Without giving away too much of the plot,
the demands of the character of Aaron Stampler are extraordinary. Yet, even though
you can see the clichéd ending coming a mile away, you still believe absolutely in
Aaron Stampler. Without Norton, the movie wouldn’t even sustain itself as long as
it does. Essentially, Norton found himself, as an actor, having to play a character who
is a great actor.

The sophistication and layers of his performance suggest that he is already miles
ahead of most first-time actors, and promise a great career ahead of him. It is very early
for Oscar talk, but I think it is not overstepping to say that so far, Norton has given
one of the strongest supporting performances of the year.

Overall, Primal Fear is a bit too easy, a bit too shadily manipulative, but leaving
the theater, you are not that upset about it. You have seen, after all, some great actors
playing some pretty good roles with absolutely perfect pitch. And you even kind of
get sucked in to the story, even though you know you probably shouldn’t.

As an old guy coming out of the theater where I work said after seeing the film,
“I don’t trust you; I don’t trust nobody.”

ALEX CHRISTENSEN
PHI M o VIE CRITIC

hat can you expect from a legal
thriller? Well, if you go by
t h e I o h n

Grisham-genre standard, not much
courtroom action at all. I enjoyed The
Firm, The Pelican Brief (which not many
people know is a sequel to All the
President’s Men with Denzel Washing-
ton in the Redford role and Julia Roberts
in the Dustin Hoffman role), and The
Client, but there is something distinctly
anti-lawyer about them.

Maybe it is because Grisham was fed
up with lawyers during his career as one,
maybe he is just matching the national
mood. His heroes are always new to the
legal system and forced through events to “take it on,” of course, always triumphing
in the end. The plots are tight and have explosions and fights and danger.

Not to complain too much, but Primal Fear is certainly not a well-plotted movie.
The pacing, the acting, the mood, are all sustained, but the actual events of the story
may leave you feeling used and a bit deceived yourself. The ending is such that I
hesitate to call it a “thriller,” but I think in the end the hokey final moments are not
enough to spoil what turns out to be a quite entertaining ride.

Primal Fear is a different kind of thriller. There is very little idealism except that
which is actually generated during the film. That is, instead of a hero on a white horse

Imagine you are the parent of lovely teenage daughter.
It’s the night before her high school graduation, and you
kiss her good-bye as she leaves with her boyfriend to attend
a party. You tell her to take her sweater because it’s cold
outside, but she doesn’t listen. She always was headstrong
and independent-minded.

Later that night, you get a call from the police. Your
daughter and her boyfriend have been murdered. She was
raped, forced to lie face down in the mud, and shot in the
back of the head. There are no limits to your rage. Thank-

fully, the murderer I caught, put on trial, and sentenced to V

death. Enter a nun. She works tirelessly to free your
daughter’s killer from Death Row. She aggressively fights
for the abolition of capital punishment. Tears drop from her
face as the murderer is electrocuted. How do you feel?
Betrayed? Angry? Victimized?

As you may have already guessed, this actually hap-
pened. It is the subject ofDead Man Walking:/in Eyewit-

Sean Penn. Both actors were nominated for Academy
Award. Many do not know, however, that it was based on
a book by Prejean, who served as an advisor to the ﬁlm.

The book follows the path of Sister Helen as she
becomes the spiritual advisor to a condemned man, Pat
Sonnier. Although she puts up a valiant fight to win this
man a pardon from the governor, Prejean must prepare this
man for death. She uses her skill as a counselor and nun
to help Sonnier realize that murdering those two children
was wrong. They agree that killing him is also wrong, but
personal accountability remains an important part of her
counseling. Despite attempts to bar her from Death Row
by prison officials, Prejean takes on more inmates after
Sonnier’s execution. In turn, she become one of the most
ardent opponents of the death penalty in the United States
today. In 1993-1994, she visited the campus of Washing-
ton and Lee to talk about her experiences.

Above all, Dead Man Walking is a persuasive attack on
the Death Penalty. Prejean outlines every conceivable
argument used against it including the most legal and

ment is biased against the poor and racial minorities.
Through painstaking research, she has found that the death
penalty is unfairly administered and unjustly doled out.
Nevertheless, we have to ask that if the death penalty
existed in a vacuum, would it still be fair? Prejean answers
no. God’s law is clear: thou shalt not kill. If it is wrong for
the Pat Sonniers of the world, then it is wrong for the
American government. Prejean also argues that revenge is
fleeting and leaves you empty no matter how terrible your
rage.

Most striking about Sister Helen was her willingness to
search out the victims’ families of the men she counseled
on Death Row. Although some were openly hostile to her,
many received her with open arms. They respected her
opinion and were grateful that she did not ignore the
victims of horrible crimes.

I used to favor capital punishment. Some crimes were
too heinous for me to oppose it. I even said, ‘‘In crimes
against children, I support the death penalty for the death
penalty’s sake.”Dead Man Walking is compelling account
of the way capital punishment operates in the U.S. today.
If you support it, reading this book may very well change
your mind.

Early exitfrom college
into NBA a mistake?

D The Big Fan, from page 6

But they are making a huge mistake. Sure, you ﬁgure that some collegiate
athletes need a road map to ﬁnd a classroom. True enough, but some athletes
find that college motivates them to succeed academically. book at Jacque
Vaughn of Kansas. Besides being a talented point guard who should star in the
NBA for many years, Vaughn carries a 3.7 GPA and even quotes Robert Frost.
And yes, Vaughn will remain at Kansas to graduate.

Many of the athletes who leave school two or more years early never have
the intention of graduating. Like Marbury, they just use college as a way to
position themselves for the NBA.

But a college degree should be more than just a piece of paper for these guys;
it may actually mean something. One figures the top fifteen players selected in
the draft will be starters, but it gets hazy after that. Some players may ride the
pine in the NBA, while others less fortunate may head forthe European leagues.

For those who do make the NBA, what will they do in ﬁfteen years when their
knees start giving out and their shooting touch leaves them? They’l1be forced
to find jobs in the regular work force, but without a degree, where do they start?
One thing college would do is teach athletes how to integrate themselves with
people you don’! ﬁnd in locker rooms. lt is unlikely you’ll see lverson behind
a desk at IBM or Garnett manning the phones for AT&T. Unless they get plenty
of endorsements, they’ll need to ﬁnd themselves regular employment. You’re
more likely to ﬁnd some of the lesser players cooking hot dogs at Stop-ln or
stocking shelves at Wal-Mart, reminiscing about the good old days when they
made plenty of money.

‘lt’s a darn shame, but with a full ride through school and people who want
to help them succeed academically, they’ll have nobody to blame but them-
selves.

Women’s tennis dominates national tournaet

vancing to the second round.
The Generals had no trouble
racking up a victory against
Sewanee, S-0.

Washington and Lee was
led by the national No. 1
doubles team of Natalia Garcia
and Julie Ayers, who cruised to
an 8-0 victory. Berry
Blankinship and Ericka
Shapard also had no problem
posting an 8-2 win at number
two doubles. Shelley
Sunderman and Helen Chan-
dler completed the doubles
sweep, winning 8-2 at the num-
ber three position.

In the singles competition,
the Generals needed just two
matches to win the decision.

he Washington And Lee
women’s tennis team,
ranked fourth in Division
III, continued its incredible sea-
son with a great performance at
the fourteen-team national tour-
nament this week. W&L fin-
ished the regular season with a
perfect 16-0 mark. This record
included a 6-3 victory over the
University of the South
(Sewanee, TN), who the Gener-
als met on Tuesday in the first
round of the NCAA Women’s
Tennis Championships at
Kalamazoo College .

Due to the bad weather, the
tournament director announced
that matches would be played
until a decision, with the first
team to win five matches ad-

Intercollegiate Tennis Associa-
tion poll, while Garcia was
ranked 11th. Ialacciwasthe only
player to defeat Garcia in a dual
match all season.

Helen Chandler wrapped up
the win for the Generals, defeat-
ing her opponent 6-3, 6-1 at No.
6 singles.

Washington and Lee met
Pomona-PitzerforWednesday’s
second round. The Generals
struggled in doubles play, losing
two of three matches. Only the
No. 3 team of Chandler and
Sunderman won against their
Pomona-Pitzer opponents, 8-4.

But the women were not dis-
couraged bythe 2-1 deficit. They
came back to take four singles
victories. At No. 2 singles,
Shapard clinched a straight set
victory (6-1, 6-1) over Kristina
Lott. Blankinship followed suit,
posting a 6-4, 6-4 win against

Christie Cooley. Sunderman
and Chandler finished off the
win for the Generals, both down-
ing their opposition 6-2, 6-0.

Garcia and Ayers were not
able to finish their matches be-
cause play was called due to
weather.

But with the 5-2 victory, the
women advanced to the semi-
finals. They met second-seeded
Trinity on Thursday morning.
This semiﬁnal match between
W&L and Trinity was a rematch
of last year’s consolation finals
of the NCAAs. The Generals
prevailed, 5-4, in that meeting,
the only match ever between the
two teams.

W&L pulled off the upset
over Trinity, 5-2. The Generals
jumped to an early lead after
Ayers and Garcia defeated the
sixth-ranked tandem of Laura
Brady and Vanessa Hill, 8-4.

Losses to

Generals‘
dream season

BY CHRIS PUGSLEY
PHI STAFF WRITER

he Washington and Lee

Generals have just com-

pleted their best season
since 1935 with a trip to
Lynchburg to challenge for the
Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence title. Unfortunately, the
Generals came up short in their
efforts and finished the season
with a 16-11 overall record.

In the first round, the Gener-
als met the Marlins of Virginia
Wesleyan. Matt Errnigiotti gave
his best effort on the hill but six
Generals’ errors caused Wash-
ington and Lee to falter to a 6-3
loss. The Generals fell behind
early but maintained a positive
attitude and tried to make acome-
back. W&L scored twice in the
bottom of the sixth inning on

scored once in the seventh, but
the Marlins added single runs in
the eighth and ninth to pull off
the win.

The results of this tourna-

he Washington and Lee
men’s lacrosse team
pulled off an exiting 11-8
victory over the VMI Keydets in
last Saturday’s Ninth Annual
Lee-Jackson Classic.

In front of a crowd of over
4,000, the Generals pulled away
to a 5-2 lead by the end of the
first quarter, W&L outscored
VMI 3-0 in the second, putting
the score going into half-time at

But the Keydets, under the
guidance of head coach Doug
Bartlett, refused to let the Gen-
erals run away with the game.
They scored six straight goals in
the third quarter, with senior
midfielder David Belfiore net-
ting two goals and an assist to
lead the rally. W&L’s troubles
in the third, especially in man-
down situations, was partially
due to the loss of junior
defenseman Pete Rowan to a
knee injury.

The 8-8 tie going into the
final quarter was not the only
trouble the Generals faced.
W&L had to fight off a three-
minute stick penalty to start the
quarter. Sophomore midfielder
Ed Dougherty broke the tie, scor-
ing at the 10:34 mark.
Midfielders Adam Butterworth
and Chip Thompson followed
Dougherty’s lead, each caging
fourth quarter goals to ice the
win for the Generals. -

awarded the Worrell-Fallon
Memorial Award. Olson set a
Lee-Jackson record, making 18
saves. McLaughlin also had an
outstanding performance, scor-
ing a career-high three goals and
winning eight of twelve face-
offs.

Head coach Jim Stagnittawas
happy with his team’s effort,
especially with the fact that the
majority of the scoring came
from the team’s younger play-
ers. The Generals finished off
the season ranking 12th in Divi-

sion Ill, and won ten games for
the first time since 1993.
Stagnitta is looking forward

to next season when he will have ’

a talented core returning and a
promising freshmen class com-

off-season, Stagnitta hopes that

the players will come back.

said, “They’re so close and they
know it. One goal away from
the playoffs, two from being in
the top six teams, and three from
having a home seed. You can’!

Warngr gampaign plays on W&L rgots
Commercial set at Lee Chapel

BY DAVID BALSLEY
PHI STAFF WRITER

tudents of Washington and Lee

University, as well as Lee

Chapel, are featured in one of

Senator John Wamer’s current televi-

sion campaign commercials. The com-

mereiahwhiclrwastapeu our mg IVIOCK

Convention, depicts four students walk-

ing with Senator Warner away from
Lee Chapel.

Eric Peterson, a spokesman for

-=-Wm-ner;=-commented-that Warner ap-

proached four students “who just hap-
pened to be passing by” and asked them
if they would walk with hifri and possi-

bly appear in one of his commercials.
Accordingto Peterson, thestudents“vol-
unteered their time to walk with Senator
Warner and to discuss their lives, their
hopes, their plans for the future.” The
result of the taping is a brief segment in
one of Wamer’s campaign commer-
cials in which the four students appear
alongside Warner.

Peterson stated that Warner wanted
to feature students in his commercial in
order to convey the message that he
“represents all Virginians, not only all
economic strata, but also strata of all
youth.” In addition, the commercial is
intended to depict Warner as concerned
for Virginia’s workers, as well as its
students, whom Peterson described as

“the next generation of workers.”
Peterson added, “Plus the fact that
Washington and Lee is his alma mater.”

Warner, who graduated from W&L
with a B.S. degree in basic engineering
in 1949, has since served as a member
of the university’s Board of Trustees
and is a member of the Washington and
Lee Alpha“€hapter of Omicron Delta’
Kappa. With regard to Wamer’s ties to
W&L, Tim Moorehead, a Washington
and Lee alum who works with Senator
Warner, commented that Warner
wanted to “feature W&L prominently
in his commercial.’.’.. -

The commercial is programmed for
“high saturation” andairs" throughout
Virginia.

Freshmen express W&L dissatisfaction

BY JENNIFER MENDOCHA
Pm STAFF WRITER

his has been quite a year for students ex-
pressing dissatisfaction with aspects of life
at W&L.

It seems that the freshman class in particular has
been especially straightforward and outspoken. Both
campus newspapers have published editorials ex-
pressing frustration with various aspects of life at
W&L, from the fratemity-oriented social scene to
the dubious characterization of what should and
should not constitute an Honor Violation.

Brian Jacob, a freshman who intends to transfer
at the end of the year, suggests two predominant
reasons why students may be dissatisfied.

“The social life...people don’t have an altema-
tive to fraternity parties. Secondly, people here tend
to be less accepting of differences. The fact that
W&L is so homogeneous could be overlooked if
people were more accepting and open-minded.”

Jacob notes that it is not necessarily that Lexing-
ton is too dull.

“When one is around the right people, location
doesn’t matter.”

He does, however, indicate that more options
need to be available to independent students.

“The Independent Student Union is weak and
disorganized. That is, if it actually exists.”

Several freshmen, afraid of fraternity reprisals
and various other negative repercussions, com-
mented anonymously.

A freshman female noted that “everything is a
date function...FD, Foxﬁeld...and it all involves

drinking to excess. The entire premise of the ‘ honor’
speech we heard at the beginning of the year at Lee
Chapel is lost in the hypocrisy of the drunk students
televised at Mock Con. W&L is a closed society
with old money tradition, and the administration
doesn’t have an interest in changing it.”

Other random W&L gripes procured from the
disgruntled Class of ‘99 include:

“People here are immature. They’re largely from
sheltered backgrounds, and don’t have much life
experience.”

“No college is truly realistic, but W&L is particu-
larly far from reality.”

“Everyoneisthesame...carbon copies ofJ.Crew.”

“People here aren’t as smart as I had hoped they
would be.”

“I considered transferring at the start of the year
because I felt that W&L was like a country club,
detached from the real world.”

Everyone remembers the words of freshman Bill
Overbaugh, who questioned the implications of our
Honor Code in a controversial editorial.

Overbaugh emphasizes that he does not think
that students feel a specific dissatisfaction with
W&L. Rather, he perceives a need to “make our
little section of pretty good into perfect.”

Although he understands that the Honor Code
cannot be governed by the beliefs of one person, he
hopes that debating the issue can strengthen the
situation.

“To me, it is very clear that underage drinking is
against the honor code.”

He emphatically states that he is “not trying to
alter the principles” of W&L; he merely “saw a
weakness” and questioned it.

Overbaugh claims “many people have responded
in trying to follow the Honor Code a little more
closely, which is exactly what I wanted.”

In spite of the many criticisms of W&L, most
people praise their professors and agree that aca-
demics here are a great strength.

Junior Paul Saboe, from an upperclassman’s
vantage point, disagrees with recent remarks that
underclassmen are becoming increasingly socially
inept.

“We are getting smarter students, but they are
still well-rounded. More freshmen can be found
doing their own thing, however.”

Freshman Nathan Hager received much criti-
cism regarding his editorial, which dealt with his
conception of the Honor Code.

He is tired of the whole debate and stresses that
“It’s not a big deal to me anymore. We have a lying,
cheating, stealing system at W&L, and that’s ﬁne. I
must learn to focus on the positive aspects of W&L
and not the little things like an Honor System that
won’t exist three years from now when I leave this
school.”

It is difficult to pinpoint reasons for what
appears to be discontentment among the Class
of ‘99. '

It is clear, however, that grievances are found not
only in the freshman class; many of the aforemen-
tioned quotes could have been uttered by any num-
ber of students on campus.

Criticisms alone, though, are next to meaningless.
If students can utilize their criticisms in a productive
manner, to implement changes in what he or she
perceives are faulty aspects of W&L, our community
will be improved, rather than weakened.

Edwards advises women on ‘glass ceiling’

BY MICHAEL HEwi.Ei'r
oodlefest. Betsy Pm STAFF WRITER

he glass ceiling still exists but

opportunities are opening up

for women, said Shirley
Edwards on Wednesday, May 15 in
Room 221 in the C-School.

Her comments were part of a lec-
ture entitled “Breaking through the
Glass Ceiling.” The lecture was spon-
sored by Decade.

According to a report from Presi-
dent Bush’s Commission to study the
glass ceiling, the executive suite is
still overwhelmingly white and male.
Ninety-ﬁve percent of all Fortune 500

CEO’s are male.

“The revolution has not reached
top management.”

Edwards also said women, regard-
less of educational levels, continue to
make less than men. In 1994, men
earned 24 percent more than women
for similar work. Even in those jobs
that women usually dominate such as

teaching or nursing, women still earn
less than men.

Other subtle differences occur. Ex-
ecutive training seminars by business
schools are exclusively male. These
seminars exemplify one of the ways
for people to get into senior manage-
ment.

There is some good news, Ms.
Edwards said. The Labor Department
has shown an increase in female man-
agers, who make up 41 percent of all
managers. .

Corporate leaders have become in-
creasingly cognizant of the glass ceil-
ing and the need for diversity.

“What motivates them is the bot-
tom line.”

Edwards said these CEO’s see an
increasingly global economy where
an appreciation of different cultures
will become important. By the next
century, more minorities and women
will enter the workplace and might
actually outnumber males, she said.

Certain industries have already re-
sponded to such trends. The high—tech

and service industries have been bet-
ter able to deal with cultural changes.

Catalyst, a women’s advocacy
group, said 62 percent of corporate
executives want women to be pro-
moted fairly. ,

“It’s a business decision—not a
sense of righteousness.”

Edwards argues that CEO’s feel
the pressure of giving women a fair
chance and are seeing the costs of the
glass ceiling. But she warned that
there are still problems, citing one
study that said it would take 475 years
for women to get equality.

She gave future women leaders
some advice. She urged them to take
control of their career and to aggres-
sively seek out challenging and risky
assignments that would give them
broad-based experiences.

“The inability to get high-risk as-
signments is probably the biggest
contributer to the glass ceiling.”

She stressed that taking risky as-
signments gets women exposure to
people they might not have had the

opportunity to deal with. More impor-
tantly, women should not get too spe-
cialized in their jobs but should branch
out.

Also, women must find mentors,
regardless of sex, who will help them
along in their careers, she said.

Edwards encouraged women to
support each other and form women’s
groups.

“lt’s not any different from what
men do—it’s called the Good Ole
Boy’s Network.”

Edwards said women should build
confidence in themselves and market
themselves. Having more women in a
company is a chance to humanize it,
she said. And just because a woman
has a baby does not mean she has
given up her career. Most women re-
turn to work a few months after giving
birth. She said companies need to make
the transition into work easier.

With all the challenges women face
in the workplace, Edwards remains con-
ﬁdent and emphasizes that the opportu-
nity is out there for those who seek it.

Green Land
Betsy Green ‘97

fter I stood in line for reg
istration for fall term, I
found a piece of paper

clipped to my form that really made
me think: the application for my
degree. The paper itself wasn’t
anything spectacular. They just
wanted to confirm that my name is
Elizabeth Ann Green, what my
majors are, who my advisors are,
and that I want a BA,

Still, its amazing to me to think
that soon I will be Elizabeth Ann
Green, with a BA from Washing-
ton and Lee. I can’t imagine what
the seniors must be feeling right
now. Pretty soon, they’ll be faced
with car payments, voice mail, and
overtime. Instead of doing home-
work, they’ll be doing paperwork.
On a more positive note, they’ll go
out and have fun on weekends like
the rest of us do, only without that
nagging feeling that there’s work
to be done.

The sheet of paper I got also
reminded me how many credits I
had, how many I need to graduate,
and to keep in mind all of the gen
eds and PE’s I might have been
putting off. That made me think of
the things we have to go through to
graduate —- standing in PE lines,
and in my case, suffering through
some science classes, dreaming of
time I could have spent in build-
ings I like a lot more.

But although our liberal arts
education here at W&L does some
things to make us well-rounded
individualsﬂ think it’s the experi-
ence that we have here that allows

. us to be the adults so many of us
qt will have to be soon." Thereforejl
' propose the following graduation

requirements in the great study of
life. Seniors, get cracking!

Before you graduate from Wash-
ington and Lee, you should:

{:] Bounce a check.

|:] Go to class with a bad hang
over. A

mother.

C} Use credit cards irresponsibly
and regret it.

:1 Skip a class on a beautiful day

with no regrets.

|:] Get a Harris Teeter card.

|:] Go to the Palms on your 21st
birthday.

[:] Tell a friend from high school
that you don’t have anything
in common anymore.

story over the past few weeks,

months, or even years, with-
out hearing about the great ﬁssure
in the GOP over the party ’s pro-life
platform plank.

The media blames the plank,
which calls for a constitutional
amendment to restore the sanctity
of unborn human life, for the loss in
1992, the alleged perception of the
GOP as extreme, the “gender gap,”
and the GOP’s poor prospects in
1996. The media is right about one
thing; The Republican Party ‘has
arrived at a defining moment.

Abortion poses the greatest
moral problem of our time, directly
involving our belief in the most
basic of all human rights- the right
to life. And there can be little scien-
tific doubt that an unborn baby is
human life.

For many Americans, the ongo-
ing furor over partial-birth abor-
tions has dramatized this truth. In
this procedure, usually performed
in the third trimester, the abortion-
ist delivers the baby, except for the
head, which is kept in the birth
canal. The abortionist then inserts a
pair of scissors into the back of the
baby ’s head and uses asuction cath-
eter to vacuum out the baby’s brain.
At this point, the abortionist com-

I t’s been hard to read a political

pletes the delivery of the dead
baby.

Earlier this year, Congress
passed HR 1833, banning partial-
birth abortions except in cases
where the mother’s life is endan-
gered. This measure passed the
House by an overwhelming 286-
129 margin and the Senate by a
54-44 tally. A December poll by
the Tarrance Group found 71% of
the people in favor of the ban and
only 16% opposed. A February
1996 poll by another firm found
78% of women voters in favor of
a ban.

President Clinton vetoed the
bill, claiming that the procedure is
only used in cases where the baby’
poses a severe threat to the health

of the mother. Yet Dr. Martin‘

Haskell, who has performed over"
1,000 partial-birth abortions,J.old_
the American Medical News in a
taped interview that of those abor-
tions, “80% are purely elective.”

Pro-abortion groups also
claimed that the anesthesia kills
the baby or at least prevents any
pain. But this drew a rebuttal from
both the American Society of An-
esthesiologists and the Society for
Obstetric Anesthesia and
Perinatology. These groups at-
tacked the claim as irresponsible
and asserted that anesthesia does
not even affect the baby in most
cases.

Clinton’s veto also provoked
an unprecedented letter of con-

demnation from all 8 cardinals of
the American Catholic church, who
labeled the practice infanticide, and
even the President’s ambassador
to the Vatican sided with the Catho-
lic Church’s position.

This issue will not die. But con-
trary to what the liberal media
would have you believe, the Re-
publican Party need not fear the
issue or the platform plank.

Abortion has proven to be a
winning issue for Republicans. In

 . . the
Republican
I-Party. need} .
not fear the"
6 issue or the
platform
plank. ”

the 1994 congressional elections,
not a single pro-life incumbent,
Republicanor Democratic, lost to
a pro-choice opponent in the gen-
eral election — the most under
reported story of the election.
According to exit polls from
several of the most recent elec-
tions, the GOP’s pro-life stance
consistently gives a net gain among
voters for whom abortion is the

)1

deciding factor. Finally, as Repub-
lican primaries across the country
demonstrate, most recently in the
Illinois govemor’s race, pro-life
voters represent a clear majority of
the Republican Party.

Unlike the Democrats, Repub-
licans have allowed debate on the

issue. While the Democrats denied 3

pro-life Democratic Governor Bob
Casey of Pennsylvania a chance to
even speak at their 1992 conven-

tion, the Republicans’ supposedly M

“hate-filled” convention featured
several prominent pro-choice

speakers.

And in what may be one of the

most ironic stories of 1996, pro- ‘I
‘life‘Democrats are mounting their
' own ‘challenge toitheir 'party”s' ex-

treme pro-choice platform ‘plank.
The congressional newspaper The
Hill reported last week that the K
approximately 40 pro-life congres-
sional Democrats (a number
roughly equal to that of pro-choice
Republicans) intend to try to pro- %
voke a debate over the issue at their
convention, although they hold
little hope of success.

Abortion promises to remain a
contentious issue throughout the x
campaign and one of the most stark
differences between the two par-
ties. For the moral future of the
nation and the political future of
their party, Republicans must have "
the courage to make the difficult
choice for life.

How bad could flying be’?

Ring-tum Phi Editorial Editor

s students of a university
that has a large geo-
graphic draw, most W&L

students are no strangers to airline
ﬂying. Though I dislike airplanes,
the trade-off between a three hour
ﬂight and a full day in the car is not
much of a choice in my mind.

W&L students also have more
than their share of airplane stories
(at least those who have ﬂown with
me)! Part of this is because our
“home” airport here in Roanoke
will close if someone sneezes on
the runway. Recently, I have had
several experiences that I thought
were had until last weekend, when
the unthinkable happened — an
airplane crashed into the Florida
Everglades, about 30 miles from
my home, killing all 109 people on
board.

I remember ﬂying home on a
recent break and thinking I had it
bad. My trip from Roanoke Inter-
national to the Palm Beach Intema-
tional Airport seemed like an eter-
nity. Taking off from Roanoke at

48am, the plane was packed with

W&L students (as well as the
Elrods). The first leg of the journey
was ratheruneventful, and the land-
ing in Charlotte proved to be the
most interesting part of the ﬂight.

In Charlotte there were several
hours of delays, irate professional
football players yelling at ticket
agents (Rod Woodson), and a
TCBY employee of questionable
sexual preference, causing my fel-
low travelers and me to keep going
back for napkins and spoons just to
get a better look. I finally got on
the plane to my beloved South
Florida, but my stay in Charlotte
left a bitter taste in my mouth.
Later I found out that the plane was
being held up because of mainte-
nance problems, then delayed due
to the weather. I am glad they
found the problem in hindsight.

The trip to West Palm Beach
was also doomed; everything that
I thought could go wrong did.
NASA launched a rocket, causing
our plane to take a slight detour

' over the Gulf of Mexico, several

hundred miles out of the way.
There was a severe thunderstorm,
and the worst turbulence I have
ever experienced. At one point, an
overhead compartment popped
open, spilling the contents all over
the airplne. We landed neverthe-
less, safely, from the west, and
over the Everglades. I swore that
airplanes were not for me.
During Spring Break I went to
Japan with the Wind Ensemble.
Unfortunately for me, there is vir-
tually no way to get around ﬂying.
The highlight (or lowlight) of this
trip, the 14 hour plane ride from
Chicago to Seoul, Korea, was a

personal nightmare. First because
I had to be on a plane that long,
confined in a small space with hun-
dreds of people, and second be-
cause we ﬂew Korean Air, which
is not known for their impeccable
safety record.

This safety record, or lack
thereof, was a constant source of
amusement to my Japanese host
families, who made graphic hand
gestures and crashing noises. The
Buddhist priest I stayed with told
me he would pray for us on Sun-
day. On several of the landings,
both there and back, the 747s skid-
ded all over the runway — causing
the passengers to think the stew-
ardesses were getting some ﬂight
time in. That will be the last plane
trip I take for a while.

My father told me, “As long as
your number of take-offs equals
your number of landings, you
shouldn’t complain.” I look back
and realize that nothing was as bad
as it seemed. I landed, no matter
how tough it may have been.

The passengers of Valu.let ﬂight
592 were not so lucky.

I know many W&L students
that complain about the costs of
ﬂying home on breaks (I think my
parents are at the top of that list).
Every once in awhile, these planes
come down to Earth in the wrong
ways, reinforcing many people’s
beliefs that the extra cost is worth
the extra safety. I am in no way
accusing the budget airlines-we all

know of major airlines’ problems -
USAir, Delta, American, United.

President Clinton has been push-
ing for lower fares, and reportedly
giving special regulatory breaks to ,1-
start-up airlines like Valulet, in an
attempt to create more competi-
tion, and hence, lower fares. The
Transportation Department is start- ,
ing an investigation into the Fed)
eral Aviation Administration and
whether the Clinton administra-
tion has put too much pressure on
them to certify new airlines. The I
Valu.let crash, as of Wednesday
night, is thought to have occurred
because of hazardous materials
underneath the plane, something
ValuJet was not certified to carry.»-

Was this because of an inspec-
tion oversight? Possibly because
of lax regulations? Lax regula-
tions to cut costs and make airline
travel available to everyone? I‘
will gladly pay the costs of the
market dominated by a few air-
lines. These other airlines cut into
the major airlines and will eventu- X
ally cause them to cut costs also.
To me, the extra safety is worth
the extra money.

This tragedy could have hap-

pened to any of the W&L students 1
who routinely ﬂy home. For those

students, and especially for the
families of the 109 people aboard
ﬂight 592, I hope that there is not
some desk jockey in Washington
second guessing himself, or cov-
ering up something, tonight.

WILD NIGHTS

 

BY DAN ODENWALD
AND
SECRET AGENT WOMAN

As graduation rapidly approaches,
you won’t ﬁnd seniors in the computer
labs working on their theses. You
won’t ﬁnd them in the Career Develop-
ment and Placement Ofﬁce desper-
ately trying to land a job. And you
certainly won’t ﬁnd them at fraternity
parties (four years is quite enough of
that, thank you).

So where are on earth is the Class of
1996?That’s right, you guessed it —
The Palms. The place where everyone

knows your name. The place where all
the people go. The place where, if you
squint your eyes tightly enough, the
bartender looks like Woody Harrelson.

The Palms has long ago joined the
pantheon of Washington and Lee tradi-
tions. It ranks up there with the Honor
System, fraternities, academic excel-
lence, and even our beloved 99—year-
old Ring-tum Phi. So what is it about
the Palms that is so enchanting? What
draws countless W&L students to its
doors on warm spring nights? What is
the Palms mystique?

What follows are the opinions of
two W&L undergraduates. First, the
naive neophyte. He turned 21 only
four months ago. Lured to Lexington’s
most famous bar by the legendary drink

specials, he desperately attempts to
carve his own Palms niche.

Second, we have the jaded veteran.
She is bright, cheerful, and has used
her sultry Southern accent to win more
than her fair share of free drinks. She’s
been frequenting the bar for over a year
now, knows every employee by name
and scent, and can capture the best
table on the most crowded of nights.
She is indeed the Grand Palms Diva.

Read on for two accounts of our
favorite watering hole. From green
eyes to eyes that have seen it all, we’ll
de-construct the Palms mystique for all
inquiring minds.‘ (Special apologies to
Journalism Professor Brian Richardson
who should advise his In-depth Writ-
ing students never to mix his teachings
with alcohol.)

The Neophyte

It’s Wednesday night and the
driving rain has kept away many
of the Palms’ mostfaithful. But
the die-hard fringe is here, as
always. The crowd is an odd

‘ mixture — recent VMI graduates . "
, dressed in civilian-clothesvrartduw
-arrned with diplomas still wet

with ink, a smattering of townies
who occasionally call up their
favorite countrysong on thejuke-
box, and W&L kids escaping the
dubious pressures of Spring
Term.

Top 40 hits come blaring out
of the speakers on the ceiling.
Alanis, Stone Temple Pilots, Ace
of Base, and Right Said Fred pro-
vide the melodic backdrop to this
scene. The bar smells of ciga-
rettes and spilled beer. I munch
on the much-too-salty popcorn,
each kernel dehydrating me ever
so slightly. (What a marketing
ploy! Obviously, the owner must
be a C-School graduate.)

I sit with three friends. We
pass the night by drinking pitch-
ers of Bud Lite and telling embar-
rassing sex stories. Parents walk-
ing in on you, moving furniture,
pasta — you know the sort...

But our talk isn’t all frivolous.
We talk about departed friends,

scorned minority groups, and tat-
toos.

I learn what it’s like to grow
up in Hilton Head where “there
are no rules.” I learn that talking

.ing basketballs aren’t always

bouncing basketballs.

But the conversation begins
to turn too steamy for my inno-
cent ears, and my eyes start to
wander.

Scanningthe hazy bar, I focus
on one girl — a friend from last
year. She’s a recent graduate
who never quite found her way
home after Alumni Weekend. It’s
rumored that she’s been here ev-
ery night since then. Her arms
are thrown about a law student’s
neck and the two drink and laugh,
drink and laugh, drink and laugh.

She spots me and beckons me
over with the come-hither mo-
tion of her index finger. I roll my
eyes.

Please don’t let her throw up
on me, I think.

“You look great,” I say as I
put my arms around her waist in
a friendly hug. She really does
look great. She’s lost about 20
pounds since I last saw her and

her hair has gotten lighter. Look-
ing very J. Crew in her blue skirt
and ribbed white sweater, 7 she
smiles widely. Her eyes are strik-
ingly blue, but clouded and blood-
shot. She§s been here a long
time. ‘

matter-of-factly.

I stand their with a puzzled
expression on my facegkindof
like when my grandmother told
me she had corns on her feet.
What was I supposed to say?
How wonderful? Your parents
must be so proud?

“For depression,” she quickly
adds. Well, I’m glad it’s not for
prostate trouble. Searching for
something to say, her tall red-
headed friend comes out of, no
where and grabs her by the arm
whisking her away to bigger and
better things, namely the law stu-
dent who has since moved down
the bar.

Somewhat irked, I wander
back to my table, desirous of
more stories and hops.

This is what the Palms is all
about, my friends. Bud Lite,
Prozacky alumnus, and good
talks. Odd, quirky, salty. It’ll
win you over every time.

It’s 12:40 am. I’ve settled
down in some of the szrase-green
wooden booths at the Palms. If

is, go back to Texas and sign up

tables. Kip, the ever famous bar-
tender smokes in the back corner
of the long, glazed wooden bar,
trying to hide from several
drunken regulars hungry to talk
to someone, anyone about their
day.Why do people come to the
Palms? The atmosphere? The
liquor? The good deals on Bud
Lite pitchers? No.

The bar is lined with every
kind of liquor you can pronounce
and even some you can’t. In
bourbon alone, the bar has six
types, ranging from the old-
standby, Jim Beam, to Old Grand
Dad, a far richer, cleaner sweet
blend.

Washington and Lee students,
VMI cadets, Mary Baldwin,
Sweet Briar, and Hollins girls-
they all come to here for the
people.

Where else can you ﬁnd a bar
manager who stands ﬁve feet tall

break up ﬁghts? Where else can
you ﬁnd a bartender with one

East Lex of the ABCstore._ If you
make friends with Kip, he may
serve you three bourbon and
cokes for $1.75.

Some nights are hard to miss
at the Palms. Four days before
the 1996 class graduated from
VMI, a sea of white cadet uni-
forms were seen in the Palms.
By one o’clock, some were ﬁnd-
ing it difficult to stand, while
others were balanced uneasily
upon their barstools. All of them
secretly wished for seatbelts to
hold them upright. One poor
celebrant went down the steep
staircase the hard way, while one
was locked in the bathroom for
an intense one-on-one counsel-
ing session with the porcelain
god. And then the real fun started.

A Lexington man in his mid-
twenties stumbled back to his
table from the bar and acciden-
tally knocked the hat off an un-

loved cap ﬂew off the guy’s head
and onto the beer-spattered, ciga-
rette-stained ﬂoor. The cadet
shot up out of his chair like a bat
out of hell.

‘slightlyfthe angry cadet yelled,

but the words were drowned out
by a screaming rendition of
“Come to My Window” by Mel-
issa Etheridge. The cadet pushed
again and a scufﬂe started. The
wave of white shirts caved in on
the scene.

Donnie, the small but loud
bar manager, glanced up from
her romance novel hidden be-
hind her cashier’s dC:k. Seeing
the trouble, the usually petite,
friendly, woman grabbed her fa-
mous green bat and plunged into
the crowd. The white wave broke
as cadets ﬂed the area. The mi-
nor ﬁght broke quickly and si-
Iently. With her job done, Donnie
shouted, “Last call!”

Hands from every comer of
the bar shot into the air, trying to
get the attention of their faithful
server. The night would end on
the same note as it had begun —
free—ﬂowing alcohol, laughter,
and cheer.

Twister: Jurassic Park, but like, it doesn't suck

BY ALEX CHRISTENSEN
PHI MOVIE Cnrrrc

ﬁﬁﬁﬁ of4 stars; only
the stuffy would complain

The pitch: “It’ll be like
Jurassic Park meets
Speed!”

I did not go into Twister with unrea-
sonable expectations. I just wanted to
be entertained. Then the picture came
up on the screen, the wind blew me
back in my seat, and I embarked on the
greatest thrill-ride of a movie since
Speed or Natural Born Killers. Twister
is so real and powerful and, above all,
entertaining, that to complain that the
story is a little hokey or the characters
said clichéd lines is a fundamental mis-
understanding of the ﬁlm. It’s toma-
does, man!

Comparing Twister toJurassicPark
is very valid. Michael Crichton wrote
both ﬁlms, and they both feature “stars”
who were completely computer-gen-
erated. Steven Spielberg produced both
ﬁlms, as well. There was a lot which
disappointed me about Jurassic Park,
however. For one thing, all of the char-
acters were so annoying that I kept
wishing for them all to die. Also, and I
know this is a completely nonsensical
thing to say, but I just could not appre-
ciate the effects much at all. Sure, they

were impressive, but I mean, so is a
Van Gogh; I do not want to spend two
hours sitting in front of a movie screen
with a Van Gogh on it. There has to be
an emotional involvement and an ef-
fective visual use of effects to really
impress. For instance, I thought the
most effective use of effects inJurassic
Park was when the cow is lowered into
the cage and is ripped apart offscreen.
The noises were great. They conveyed
everything that needed to be conveyed.
Another good scene was when Wayne
Knight’s character, attempting to
smuggle DNAofftheisland,waskilled
by the poison-shooting dinosaur. I think
that was an animatronic dinosaur,
though. So why was I watching a
movie?

I could have been home on my
couch listening to the radio or watch-
ing “Muppets Tonight!” I wished I was
home on my couch listening to the
radio or watching “Muppets Tonight!”
Maybe tonight I will stay home on my
couch and listen to the radio or watch
“Muppets Tonight!”

Or maybe I will go see Twister
again. Because, brother, does Jan de
Bont, the director who brought us
Speed, and the cinematographer who
brought us Cujo, Die Hard, and The
Hunt for Red October, know how to
make a movie that is both exciting,
gripping, and roundhouse-punch scary.
When I saw Speed for the ﬁrst time, I
was actually dodging and jumping in
my seat and swearing out loud. (This
can be very annoying to those seated

around you. Be forewarned. Twister is
such a panic-inducing movie.)

Jack N. Green, Twister’s cinema-
tographer and Clint Eastwood’s for the
gorgeous Unforgiven and Bridges of
Madison County, pulls off some truly
amazing helicopter shots and shots that
require expert timing. He also photo-
graphs nature with such an unerring
eye that you see the movie as a land-
scape of plains which intersects in an
eerily beautiful way with the deadly
power of nature as manifested by the
tornadoes. You always feel that what is
happening on screen is moving toward
you, like your feet are on the ground
with the characters, as well.

I guess I will give a brief plot sum-
mary. The plot does not really matter.
The plot is just an excuse for a bunch of
tornadoes and destruction. This is a
good thing. I do not want to be bothered
with emotional baggage or following
the intricacies of some loser’s
backstory. I want to see something get
knocked over. De Bont comes through
for me.

So anyway, there are these storm-
chasers, see, they want to ﬁnd out how
a tornado works, because nobody re-
ally knows, so they design “Dorothy” a
machine that enters the eye of a tor-
nado (they have to place it the tomado’s
path, of course) and releases hundreds
of tiny sensors, which then record and
transmit detailed information back to
the scientists’ computers. Bill (Bill
Paxton) designed Dorothy, but he has
left the project, and his wife Jo (Helen

Hunt) for a new job as a weatherman
and a new life with his ﬁancée, Melissa
(Jami Gertz). Of course, on a trek out to
get Jo to sign the divorce papers, Bill
gets sucked back in with the old crew.
Yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah.
Then there is this evil corporate storm-
chaser, Jonas (Cary Elwes), who has
stolen the design of Dorothy and is
looking to get his ﬁndings completed
before the other group. A rare storm
configuration has presented some
unique opportunities for study, so the
race is on between the two groups to
place and operate their machine ﬁrst.
Sound stupid? It is. Don’t think about
it too much.

Unlike inJurassicPark, dc Bont has
the good sense to treat the human char-
acters like what they are: bit players.
There is almost no manipulative crap
to try and get you to care while you are
just waiting for the next cool effect.

Who can think anyway with a big
tornado barreling toward you, swirling
and roiling with debris and dust and
who knows? hellﬁre and a kind of cruel
intelligent mindlessness that Spielberg
wishes his dippy Velociraptors had had
for one second? Who needs to? Prob-
ably some idiot movie critic.

But if you are looking for a movie
that is a movie in every full, complete
sense of the word, the kind of movie
you can watch with popcorn on Satur-
day afternoon, Twister is it. It is a four-
star action picture, a four-star disaster
picture, and that adds up to a four-star
picture.

F G&L speaker, from page 1

sexuals at W&L. He stated that “gays
and lesbians need an environment in
which they can come out,” and while
White does not feel that the Washing-
ton and Lee community is hostile to-
ward homosexuals, he also maintains
that it is not “entirely supportive.”
White sees education, concerning ho-
mosexuals and homosexual issues, as
the most pressing need on campus, but
admits that the process will take time.
White stated that his purpose was “to
talk about what we should do before
having a Coming Out Day,” as he did
not feel that W&L was prepared for
such an event at this time.

Rev. Steen, a 1966 graduate of
Washington and Lee, was the
evening’s keynote speaker. Steen is
an Episcopal minister based in Wash-
ington, D.C. who considers his sexu-
ality “a great gift.” He stated that he
was delighted to speak on a subject he
feels so strongly about, particularly
due to his history at W&L. The fact
that he was invited to speak on gay
issues in Lee Chapel was itself an
indication to Steen that “change is
taking place.”

Like White, Steen stressed the im-
portance of education, and he believes
“there is no substitute for knowing
someone who is lesbian or gay” for
getting rid of old prejudices. At a
reception following the event, Dean
of Students David Howison agreed
that “understanding differences” was
a key factor in overcoming prejudices.
Sophomore Milagros Daly, who at-
tended the program, concurred. “This

    
  
  
  
  

school needs to be more tolerant. I
would like to see some change,” Daly
stated. ,

In resolving cases of race, gender,
or economic differences, Steen said
“all the same dynamics apply,” but
resolving differences in sexual orien-
tation presents an additional hurdle.
People say that gays are “immoral”
and call their behavior “sick and un-
natural,” and for this reason dealing
with homophobia is all the more difﬁ-
cult according to Steen.

Steen stated that “unless gays are
willing to stand up and talk,” nothing
will happen to change attitudes to-
ward them. He hoped, by speaking at
W&L, to “effect change,” a desire
obvious even during his undergradu-
ate years at W&L. Steen was one of
the ﬁrst members of Contact, and he
was also involved in the effort to end
segregation.

The latter was “the big social is-
sue” during his time in Lexington, and
segregation ended the year of his
graduation. Steen also stated that he
came to address the crowd in Lee
Chapel to honor the memory of a de-
ceased friend and others like him, who
lived or continue to live “lives of quiet
desperation” and who fear discovery
of their homosexuality.

Rev. Steen has no memory of
discussion of gay issues at Washing-
ton and Lee, or in society, during the
1960’s, although he estimates that three
to four thousand gays and lesbians
have graduated from W&L over the
years. He stated that there was “no
awareness among gay students” that
there were other homosexuals on cam-
pus. Most of these people, Steen be-

lieves, hid their sexual preferences in
an effort to ﬁt in, and he attributes the
“confusion” he experienced for years
to “repressive atmospheres.” A re-
pressive environment, in his opinion,
“forces people into relationships that
aren’t good for anyone.”

After the dissolution of his mar-
riage, Steen slowly became “more
honest” with himself, and he eventu-
ally came out to members of his par-
ish. Steen compared the church’s re-
action to the military’s “don’t ask -
don’t tell” policy, but stated that he
was proud, not ashamed, to reveal his
homosexuality. Therefore he was not
upset to be “outed” ﬁve years ago on
the front page of the Washington Post,
but rather found the experience “won-
derfully freeing.” He jokingly com-
mented that, after that incident, he
never had to “come out” to anyone
again.

Steen’s current work involves re-
solving differences within congrega-
tions resulting from differences in race,
gender, economic and social back-
grounds, and sexual orientation. He
credits his fascination with diversity
as the basis for his work, and says that
he has always sought to “build diverse
congregations.” He also believes that
his work is in keeping with the current
desire to reinforce “family values.”

Steen said that he cannot under-
stand how suppression of homosexu-
ality can be healthy and promote a
positive family unit, and he believes
an open, supportive environment is
beneﬁcial for everyone. Heconcluded
with a wish for the future at W&L, that
homosexuals will learn to be proud of
their sexuality, and that heterosexuals

Stadium. And when the teams is los-
ing? Forget it. You could start a
bonﬁre in the stands and nobody would
notice.

As for the players, let’s run down
the lineup. First, Mark Grudzielanek.
Phillies broadcaster Rich Ashbum re-
ferred to him as “Mark Grudzalansky”
several weeks ago, so obviously Mark
has a rep. If he keeps hitting .360,
Grudzielanek will become a house-
hold name. Next, there is Mike Lan-
sing, someone formerly better known
as having the same name as the capital
of Michigan. Well, he’s hitting .323. A
Sense a pattern here?

Batting third is Henry Rodriguez.
Henry was a reserve outﬁelder for the
Dodgers last year. This year, he has
hit 15 homers already and is batting
.343. This is the stuff legends are
made of. He is so popularthat Montreal
fans caused a candy bar delay on Sun-
day by littering the ﬁeld with candy
bars named after Rodriguez. How
things can change in one year!

After that comes Moises Alou, the
lone superstar in the Expos lineup.
And he is “only” hitting .277. Come
on Moises, get with the program. Alou
is followed by David Segui, a guy
who had been mired on the Mets’
bench of all places. What’s David up
to in Montreal? Hitting at atorrid .341
pace, that’s what.

F.P. Santangelo hits sixth. Sounds
more like an investment ﬁrm or some-
thing. But face it, one day you’ll be
sitting with your grandchildren on your
lap telling them story after story about
back in the day when you watched the
legendary F.P. Santangelo whack the
ball a country mile. If he keeps hitting
.310, they’ll want to hear more.

Bringing up the rear of the lineup is
catcher Darren Fletcher, humming
along at .306, and power-hitting third
baseman Shane Andrews. The team
as a whole is hitting .287 and leads the
National League in runs scored. And
this is all without future star Rondell
White, who is currently on the dis-
abled list.

The pitching staff is led by Fassero,
who has spent the last two years as
trade bait, and Pedro Martinez, better
known for constantly plunking bat-
ters in the past. The starting staff is
currently without Busta Rhymes pro-
tege Carlos Perez, who is also on the
DL. The veteran bullpen has held
together very well and closer Rojas
features one of the best forkballs in the

league.

If the Expos keep up this current
pace, manager Felipe Alou will need
to win more than Manager of the Year;
he should be martyred. No manager;
has done more with'less. Despite a,
team that resembles a Triple-A roster
and management that has traded away

or dumped Marquis Grissom, Delino ’

DeShields, Larry Walker, Tony:
Tarasco, Wil Cordero, Tim Wallach,1
Dennis Martinez and John Wettelanci
in recent years, Alou has the Expos?
perched atop the NL East with a 27-13:
record. No matter what he has, the"
man keeps winning. And he even
goes about it in a gentlemanly fash-
ion, not someone who gets in people’s
faces and cusses them out. You have
to feel good for a person like that.
Do I think Montreal will maintain
its pace and ﬁnish ahead of the de-
fending champion Atlanta Braves?
No. The Braves are notoriously slow
starters but are way too talented for
anyone to beat them over 162 games.
In fact, the Expos could ﬁnish any-
where in the division depending on
whether the Phillies and Marlins can
find some offense and the Mets can
find some heart. —
But for now, the beat goes on in
Montreal and Alou will hope that:
Grudzalansky and Friends stay red-
hot. If they do, maybe Felipe will get
a candy bar named after him too.

The women's tennis team competed in the NCAA
Division III National Tournament last week. De-
spite a well played contest, the Generals succumbed
to Emory in the championship match by a score
of 5 to 1.

BY BETHANY BAUMAN
PHI SPORTS EDITOR

The women’s tennis
team made their final
appearence of the season last
week at the NCAA Division III
Championships in Kalamazoo,
Michigan.

On May 7th, the 16-0 Gener-
als faced Sewanee in the ﬁrst
round, and cruised to an easy 5-
0 victory. The highlight of this
match came when Natalia
Garcia, playing at No. 1 singles,
defeated Kristen Ialacci, 6-0, 6-
0. Ialacci was the only player to
defeat Garcia in a dual match
during the regular season.

Washington and Lee met
Pomona-Pitzer for the second
round of competition. After
struggling through doubles play,

losing two of three matches, the
Generals rebounded with four
singles victories.

With the 5-2 win, the women
advanced to the semi—ﬁnals. Here
the Generals faced off against
second-seeded Trinity Univer-
sity of San Antonio, Texas.

Helen Chandler said, “Going
into nationals we had already
played many of the top teams
from the different regions. It
gave us the confidence that it
was entirely possible for us to
win the tournament.”

TheW&Lsquadplayedsome
of their best tennis of the tourna-
ment to pull off the 5-2 upset.
The Generals had an early lead
after the tandem of Garcia and
Julie Ayers trounced Trinity’s
Laura Brady and Vanessa Hill at
No. 1 doubles. Chandler and
Shelley Sunderman also posted

an 8-6 win at No. 3 doubles over
Christy Wussow and Sara
Feuler.

The Generals then made a
strong showing in singles play
against Trinity, with Garcia and
Ericka Shapard pulling in victo-
ries at the No. 1 and No.2 spots.

But perhaps the most memo-
rable match of the afternoon was
Berry Blankinship’s perfor-
mance. Playing at No. 3 singles,
she lost the first set 0-6 to
Trinity’s Lola Taylor. But
Blankinship came back to take
the match with 6-4, 7-6 second
and third set victories.

Last Friday, the women ’s ten-
nis team stood one step away
from a national title. But a tal-
ented 20-3 team from Emory
University was also in the hunt
for its first NCAA Division III
women’s tennis championship.

The Generals had a rough
start, losing two of three doubles
matches. Only the team of
Garcia and Ayers was able to
best Emory’s Amy Smith and
Megan Bern, 8-6. After the
doubles competition, the con-
test was moved from Stowe Sta-
dium to the Markin Raquet Cen-
ter due to rain.

Emory continued to display
theirwinningwaysinthesingles
competition. Jessica Levy
bested Shapard 6-1, 6-2.
Blankinship dropped her match
to Adrian Poole, 6-1, 7-5, and
Ayers lost to Megan Bern, 6-0,
6-2. Garcia, Sunderman, and
Chandler’s matches were not
completed.

While Emory may have taken
home the title after the 5-1 vic-
tory, the Generals left the tour-
nament satisﬁed.

Shapard said, “Our team
came together so well and every
single player rose to the
occassion. Each of us played
better this week than we have all

.season-maybe even ever.”

Sunderman added, “Every
match we played at nationals
was not won by one player or
another, but every person on the
team pulled through to get us to
the ﬁnals. If one person was
having a bad day, another would
step up and win her match...I
could not have asked for a better
senior gift!”

In the individual competition
of the nationals, Garcia and
Ayers were upset in the ﬁrst
round by Kenyon’s top-ranked
pair. Garcia continued on to the
singles competition, reaching the

]'_em1i§: A unanimous choice out of
probably the toughest ﬁeld of competitors,
Natalia Garcia. The sophomore led the
Generals to another ODAC championship
and appearence at the national touma-
ment. In the regular season, Garcia com-
piled a 10-1 singles record and a 12-1
doubles record in tandem with Julie Ayers.
Garcia was last year’s ITA Rookie of the
Year and will continue to be the Generals’
number one player next year.

§oc§e[: Michelle Bauman ﬁnished this
season tied for the team lead in goals with
14, second on the team in assists with 6 and
second in total points with 34. Bauman
scored the Generals’ game winning goal in
four contests. Bauman’s leadership of a
fairly young team allowed the Generals to
extend past any growing pains and leap
right into their conference schedule and
eventually place into the second-round of
ODACs.

her standards of excellence by leading the
Generals to an outstanding ﬁnish this sea-
son. Her efforts resulted in a place at the
national competition and several key per-
formances for the Generals in individual
and team competition. Prince has been a
standout swimmer for her entire collegiate
career and her leadership by example has
motivated more swimmers to strive for her
continuing levels of excellence.

   

tremendous role on the Generals track team,
posting several outstanding ﬁnishes this
season. Schaeffer carried her performances
from cross—country over to the track and
maintained her place as the Generals’ top
distance runner. Her graduation will leave
a void in the team that will be very difﬁcult
to ﬁll for her teammates. Again, another
unanimous selection for Josephine
Schaeffer.

  

gmssgz Erika Snyder ﬁnished this
season as the leading scorer and led the
Generals’ lacrosse team to a berth in the
ODAC Tournament. Snyder tallied 62
total points including team-highs of 33
goals and 29 assists. Snyder’s leadership
and outstanding point production led the
Generals to a 9-5 record including a 6-1
ODAC record. Only a junior, Snyder will
return to Lexington next year to be the top
offensive threat for the Generals.

V91 leybal I: In the wake of the Generals’
ﬁrst ODACchampionship, Cheryl Taurassi
and became the Washington and Lee all-
time assist leader in the process. Battling
several injuries this year, Taurassi used
immeasurable toughness to propel her team
to the conference title. Taurassi averaged
7.5 assists per game and totaled 527 assists
for the season. Taurassi played the key role
and allowed her teammates to feed off her
intensity and excellent play.

 : The favorite of Gener-

als cross-country, Josephine Schaeffer.
Again she attained All-American honors
and remainedW&L’s top runner. Placing
ﬁrst at several ODAC and non-conference
events, Schaeffer has led her team for four
years and is one of the top runners in the
nation. Schaeffer again took honors as
ODAC Runner of the Year and has left her
mark on the ODAC and Washington and
Lee record books for many years to come.

 

 : Sandra Holmes

just finished her senior season and out-
standing career as the Generals’ ﬂoor
leader. She averaged 11.4 points and 9.2
boards per game, while logging the most
minutes played and placing second in steals.
Holmes superb leadership helped this Gen-
erals team initiate young talent into tough
ODAC league play and helped lay the
foundation for years to come in Generals’
basketball.

BY LAURA GooDwIN
PHI STAFF WRITER

h les beaux jours! This set of
short plays and scenes, per
formed by Domnica

Radulescu’s French 328 class and di-
rected by Professor Radulescu showed
at the Lenfest Center May 21, 22 and
23.

W&L’s French community came
out to see these one acts to find com-
edy and irony running rampant. The
first scene, Ionesco’s “La Lecon”
billed as a “comic drama” shows an
arithmetic lesson gone bad in which
the teacher ends up killing his student.

“La Lecon” was followed by four
very short, amusing scenes. In the
first scene, a rather unusual women,
played in this class’s rendition by four
girls, is in the process of seducing a
gloomy young man. She informs him

that she has her own language in which

everythig is called “chat,” the French
word for “cat.” He asks her how to say
a variety of phrases and to each query

. she replies “cat.”

The other three scenes are equally
funny and strange, with a man crush-
ing a woman’s eye while attempting
to apologize for bumping into her, a
“mouth” spilling out the unhappy de-
tails of its life, and three cross-
dressed females hagglin g over a cross-

The final play features a woman,
Winnie, buried up to her chest, and
later her head, who describes her life
to to her friend, Willie. Her entire life
seems to be encased in a black bag that
lies beside her, from which she pulls
various articles during the show.

“The class has been a lot of fun,”
Liz Detter commented. “You really
get to know your classmates a lot
better in this kind of setting. Acting
in French has really been an
interesting experience.”

Cheryl Puzon added, “Dawayne
Bailey put it best. There is a grace in
going ape-shit on stage, and I think we
achieved it.”

 
   

_ > OPINION
‘GENERATION lax

BY LIZ DETTER
PHI STAFF WRITER

n Monday, May 13, 1996, a new era at
Southern Virginia College began with the
takeover of the college by a Mormon

Board of Trustees. The new chairman of the Board
of Trustees is Glade Knight, president and chairman
of Cornerstone Realty Income Trust of Richmond,
and a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter
Day Saints.

Knight, together with Roger Barrus and a group
of Mormons, bought Southern Virginia College for
Women with the intent to establish a coeducational,
four-year college based upon Mormon principles.

Southern Virginia College is not officially affili-
ated with the Mormon church; however, the bylaws,
honor code, and code of conduct have been amended
to more closely coincide with Mormon values.
SVC’s Public Relations Representative Grace Sarber
stated, “They are very vocal asbout being non-
sectarian, but they are also vocal about having
conservative Mormon values.”

Future students and faculty at SVC will be ex-
pected to dress modestly, and refrain from the use of
tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. Although coffee, tea,
and caffeinated colas are prohibited by Mormons,
they will be allowed on campus—students can still
get their Jolt.

The dorms will be single-sex, and there will be
no fraternizing of men and women in dorms. Un-
doubtedly, this is designed to prevent “hooking-
up” of the sort that occurs on most non-sectarian
campuses. Trustee Roger Barrus was quoted in the
Rockbridge Advocate as saying, “Premature sexu-
ality is the scourge of America.”

However, Sarber said that students will be al-

lowed to leave campus and behave as they see fit.
Perhaps we will still see SVC girls, and guys, at our
fraternity parties.

The new trustees lost their appeal of the decision
of the college accreditation board. and hope to
regain accreditation. They are currently in the
process of applying for accreditation as a new four-
year college.

There are also plans to re-vamp the curriculum.
The equestrian program will remain, but the Sociol-
ogy department has been eliminated. Students will
not have a major, but will all take core courses
focusing on “Great Books.”

The “Great Books” program is modeled after the
curriculum at St. John’s College, a very small lib-
eral arts college in Annapolis, Maryland. However,
SVC’s program will be much more conservative.
Darwinism and other “questionable” ideas will be
censored.

By remaining ofﬁcially non-sectarian, SVC is
eligible for $500,000 in state job-retention grants.
Tuition has been lowered from $11, 500 to $9, 000.

The Mormon church is one of the fastest-growing
churches in America. Presently, there are only two
Mormon institutions of higher education, Brigham
Young University and Ricks College. The Mormon
group’s initial proposal to take over the school stated
that only 35, 000 of the approximate 500,000 Mor-
mons of college age can attend BYU and Ricks.

SVC will be the only Mormon school east of the
Mississippi. The school hopes to begin classes in
the fall with about 250 students, and eventually
increase their numbers to -1500. Buena Vista can
expect to be flooded with students desiring a strict,
church-oriented education.

W&L can also expect to feel the impact of the
changes in SVC. If the plans for SVC succeed, the
new Mormon college will eventually grow larger

''    5 V C

than either VMI or W&L.

The contrasts between the student body at W&L
and that at the new SVC are apparent. Gone are the
days of tying pledges to the ﬂagpole at Sem, or of
road-trips to Buena Vista. It will be interesting to
see how Greeks and Mormons mix in the BV—
Lexington metropolitan area.

roceeds from this year’s sec
ond annual Spring Fling Car
nival, to be held today from 3
to 7 p.m. at the Law School Field, will
contribute to a Decade Scholarship.
This year’s Spring Fling Carnival
was sponsored by the Student Activi-
ties Ofﬁce, the Friday’s Committee
and the Decade Committee. In addi-
tion, members of APO volunteered to
work in the game booths, and the
women’s volleyball team offered to
organize the air ball tournament.
According to Michelle Richardson,
the Carnival is funded by the Student
Activities budget, which is separate
from the SAB'budget and does not
draw from W&L students’ activity
fees. The Carnival raises money by
selling concessions, such as pop corn
and beverages, and by hosting a “Battle
of the Bands,” in which students can
vote for their favorite bands by donat-
ing money to the Carnival on behalf of

those bands. This year, the proceeds
from the Carnival will contribute to a
Decade Scholarship, to be awarded to
a rising junior. This is the first year for
the Decade Scholarship.

Betsy Green, emcee for the
“Battle ofthe Bands,” commented
that the Decade Committee wanted
to establish a scholarship as a “last-
ing way to remember coeducation at
W&L.” The Decade Committee, as
described by Green, works with ex-
isting groups on campus in lectures
and art exhibits which have been in-
ﬂuenced by co-education at Wash-
ington and Lee.

The Decade Committee hosted
this year’s Battle of the Bands to
both raise funds for the Decade
Scholarship and to extend itself to the
whole student body. “In addition to
the art exhibits and lectures,” Green
stated, “we wanted to do something
fun that the whole school could be
involved in.” Green added, “After
all, one ofthe major contributions
of women to W&L has been to the
social scene.”

Letters to the Editor

Thanks for award

To the Senior Class:

I am ﬂattered and deeply grateful
to be named a recipient of this year’s
Ring-tum Phi Award. I am also em-
barrassed that I was not present at
Senior Night to receive it. Somebody
forgot to invite me. I know this letter is
a poor substitute for saying what I
should have said in person. Again,
please accept my heartfelt thanks.

But you’re not getting my Bud
Light.

Sincerely,
Brian Richardson

Colonnade art defended

Dear Editor,

We hate to use your paper as a
source of rebuttal; however, we feel
now is the time to address those per-
sons who fear change and experience.
Once again, an anonymous letter sur-
faced in the Trident where someone
deemed themselves as an authority on
other persons’ right to express them-
selves. Seventeen students have paid
over $20,000 for tuition, $65 for class
dues, $25 in lab fees and unrecorded
amounts on their individual projects.
Since they have paid this money to
receive the best education, we think it
absurd that someone chose to trample
on their academic growth.

With all the problems at Wash-
ington and Lee, why have five mounds
of clay provoked so much controversy?
Are they only to be compared with the
cans, paper cups, newspapers, bottles
and cigarette butts that adorn our hill?
Or the bulletin board in front of Gra-
ham-Lees which happened to be
knocked down by a drunk passer-by a
few weeks ago? Have you ever wit-
nessed the vandalism of the Cadaver
Society? Is the effort spent in weeks of
labor by a dedicated artist and profes-
sor to be dismissed as mere “lumps of
dirt”? As true aspiring artists, we ob-
serve these mounds and other works
now appearing on campus represent a
determination to realign ourselves in
nature, the community and
the university.

In an institution where gross ex-
penditures for student activities seem
to be of little concern, our focus should

be upon the intellectual motivations,

behind ouractions-notiipon’condemn-
ing those who encourage us to think.

The “Earth Mounds” in front of
Tucker Hall representasingle person’s
effort to broaden our concept, as stu-
dents of life, of what Art is. Simply
raisingtheissueoftheiraestheticvalue
and physical effect has a value of its
own. The fact that they are temporary
and will be removed in another week,
we believe, isatestimony to the amount
of respect Stephen Korns has for both
our traditions and the beauty of the
colonnade. Their success is measured
by their capacity to promote dialogue

and exchange.
Let us accept this challenge with

the same care with which this artwork

has been presented. We invite you to
join us Monday, May 27, to experi-
ence the entire program of visual and
musical works which offer “Access
to the Earth.”

Sincerely,

Jack Thorn ’97

Not all freshmen unhappy

To the editor:

As a member of the Class of
1999, I read with great interest your
front-page tirade entitled “Freshmen
express W&L dissatisfaction.” As a
member of the class of 1999, I write
this letter to contest your conclusions
pertaining to the attitude of my class.

I shall never have the pleasure of
challengingthoseanonymoussources
who appeared in the article, but I do
believe that I am uniquely qualiﬁed
to refute their arguments. Late in the
Winter Semester I spent nearly 30
hours speaking with my classmates
about their concerns for Washington
& Lee. Of the hundreds of students
with whom I spoke, only a handful
expressed real dissatisfaction with
either the Honor System or the frater-
nity system. I was thus rather sur-
prised by the theme of the article; the
details surprised me even more.

I was amazed by the fact that
independents want a stronger Stu-
dent Union. I had imagined that the
decision to remain “independent” was
based on an aversion to strongly or-
ganized groups. Additionally, a Stu-
dent Union program would probably
increase the cost of tuition (which
might just reinforce that chimerical
“country club, old money” tradition
which people fear).

I was amazed to find that some
people believe the administration has
no interest in changing ourtraditions.
Most of the people I know believe
that the administration is determined
to weaken our fraternities. 1 person-
ally wish to see a stronger fraternity
system. Although they suffer from
many negative stereotypes, the fra-
ternity system I admire is an autono-
mous group of students who provide
for their own activities and perform
community service (Blood Drives,
etc.). The fraternities even provide
activities for non-members every
weekend——free of charge.

I was amazed that there are
people who expect us to have a large
amount of life experience and matu-
rity after only nineteen years on
the planet.

I was amazed that people are
offended by the similarities between
many of our students and the J. Crew
models. Would they be less dissatis-
ﬁed if I sported a mohawk and a
nose ring?

The final point to amaze me was
your concusion that “it is difﬁcult to
pinpoint reasons for what appears to

Flatter means fairer

Ends & Means
Joshua Heslinga ‘98
P resignation from the Senate
last week as a bold move that
would inject a new vitality in his vital-
ity into his campaign for the presi-
dency, and early results indicate that
they were right. Nonetheless, Republi-
cans should look toward another event
from last week to find the winning
formula for 1996.
The day after Dole’s resignation,
House Majority Leader Dick Armey,

along with Bill Archer, the chairman
of the House Ways and Means com-

undits applauded Bob Dole’s

mittee, and the other principle Repub-

lican sponsors of tax reform legisla-
tion, held a press conference where
they signed a commitment to a set of
six principles for the radical changes
Republicans will enact in the income
tax code if their majorities hold
next year.

Despite their personal differences
about whether to adopt a ﬂat tax or a
national sales tax, these men gathered
to unite behind a system that “applies
a single, low rate to all Americans;
requires a supermajority of both cham-
bers of Congress to raise taxes;

provides tax relief for workin g Ameri-
cans, protects the rights of taxpayers
and reduces tax collection abuses;
eliminates the bias against savings and
investment; and promotes economic
growth and job creation.”

These Republican lawmakers re-
alize that the American people will no
longer suffer under the current bur-
densome tax code. Americans pour
nearly 5.4 billion man-hours each year,
costing over $232 billion, into the
black hole of compliance with our tax
code. This sum amounts to more than
$900 for every person in America.

Tax reform must form one of the
pillars of any winning Republican vi-
sion, as it presents one of the clearest
examples of how the Republicans stand
for innovation and liberty while the
Democrats stand for nothing more
than, to use Armey’s words, “raising
the status quo.” For the past several
elections, Republicans have had suc-
cess only when they have succeeded
in making taxes a key issue in
the campaign.

To build momentum for the com-
ing effort, Armey has released a pa-
perback book entitled The Flat Tax
that begins with the 10 line form with
which he prooposes to revolutionize
the way Americans relate to
their government.

A ﬂat tax means simplicity. Each
and every American would lose the
sense of hopelessness that sets in ev-
ery yearwhen they confront theirtaxes,
to be replaced by conﬁdence after
completing their ta form in about
five minutes..

A ﬂat tax means fairness. No
longer would we live under a system
where only the rich and powerful spe-
cial interests can invest the time and
resources necessary to beat the sys-
tem. No longer would lobbyists be
able to buy hidden tax favors from
government, because all individuals
and businesses would be treated ex-
actly the same.

A flat tax means freedom. Ac-
cording to the non-partisan Tax Foun-
dation, the average American family
now pays more than 40 percent of
their income in federal, state, and lo-
cal taxes, meaning that this year,
Americans worked until May 7 just to
earn the money to pay off
their government.

A ﬂat tax would return this money
to those who earned it. Armey’s plan
would establish an $11,350 allowance
for a single person ($22,700 for a
married couple) and a $5,300 allow-
ance for each dependent. All income
above these figures would be taxed at
a rate of 17 percent across the board,

it
meaning that a family of four would

pay no taxes on their first $33,300
of income.
A flat tax would mean growth and

opportunity throughout America. If’

would end the punishing double tax
on savings and investment, as well as
the cruel legacy of estate taxes.

And finally, a ﬂat tax is feasible;
and enforceable, unlike a national sales
tax, which would require the impos-
sible act of repealing the 16th amend-
ment and countering the incredible.
incentives to fraud that a 15 or 20
percent increase in prices would cause.

A new study by the respected
National Center for Policy Analysis
shows that the poor would gain th
most from a flﬁt tax and that a ﬂat tax
will even increase government rev-
enues by more than $24 billion due to
the increased economic activity a ﬂat
tax will stimulate.

Americans want a president with
vision, and the ﬂat tax should be the
cornerstone of our new vision for
America. Americans rebelled one
already against an onerous and unfair
tax code, beginning with just a few
Bostonians and some tea. it’s time for
America to start a second Freedom
Revolution, beginning with thtﬂ
ﬂat tax.

2 generations: X vs. Lex’

Green Land
Betsy Green ‘97

It’s been said that the W&L expe-
rience is much like spending four years
in a bubble. I couldn't agree more. It’s
easy to be separated from what’s going
on in the world when you live in a small
town, where it’s hard to see new mov-
ies or hear new music. It’s easy to miss
important news events when the news
is on opposite The Simpsons. But be-
sides being isolated from the world as
a whole, I feel that we are especially
isolated from other people in our gen-
eration. Our experience is so different
that we're almost like a different gen-
eration. Phil Flickinger’s cartoons are
accurate. We are not Generation X. We
are Generation Lex.

When I first read the term Genera-
tion X, instead of getting all angst-
ridden about hating to be labelled, I
thought it was pretty cool. This is prob-
ably one of the first signs that I didn’t
quite fit in with other Gen X’ers. My
parents are Baby Boomers. There are
news stories all the time about them,
TV shows showing their childhood
experiences, even their own edition of
Trivial Pursuit. I thought, at last, my
friends and I would get to enjoy some
of the same things. Wrong again.

Reality Bites was hailed as one of
the first Generation X centered mov-
ies. I’ve seen it twice and have been

V completely unable to relate, no matter

how hard I tried. Remember how they
were always talking about how broke
they were? Icould understand that. But
at the same time, they managed to

always have Rolling Rock beer on
hand. Where’s the Olympia? The
Schlitz? The Natural Light? Genera-
tion Lex would have spent the extra
money Rolling Rock would have cost
to get more buzz for their buck. Iguess
that’s why we have so many pre-cor-
porate C-school majors here, some-
thing you’d never find in the land of
Generation X. Being one of those C-
school types (actually, as politics ma-
jor, I’m probably C-school Lite), I
was also shocked by the way Winona
Ryder’s character went about looking
for a job. Yes, she was bright and
ambitious, but I kept thinking, “She’s
wearing that to a job interview? Why
doesn’t she brush her hair?” And
through the entire movie, I couldn’t
figure out if she was supposed to end
up with Ben Stiller or Ethan Hawke. I
was heavily leaning towards the happy
Ben Stiller, in his cute suits, which
shows what I know.

Music is another thing that’s sup-
posed to unite us twentysomethings,
but there is a clear difference between
Generation X and Generation Lex. I
read an article in a copy of GO that
Dan Odenwald left in the office in
which a fortyish man attempted to
blend into our youth culture. He dis-
covered this great music schism. If
you are our age and don’t have a job,
you listen to Hole, Rage Against the
Machine, or anything on an indie labe.
Good angry songs. If you are our age
and do have a job, you listen to Hootie
and the Blowfish, Rusted Root, or
Dave Matthews Band. Do I have to
tell you what side of that divide Gen-
eration L.ex is on?

We don’t even dress cool enough

to be bona fide members of our own
generation. When I lived in Seattle
last summer, I’d go out dressed in my
typical W&L summer wear—
sundresses, FD shirts, baseball caps. I
felt completely different from the
people my age I saw on the streets. I
wore sandals. They wore platform
shoes. How dorky of me to wear col-
ors other than black. How boring of
me to have hair of only one color, and
an earth tone at that. You can bet the
typical slacker doesn’t own any-
thing khaki.

“. . . they
have skate-
boards. We
have sport

utility
vehicles”

The differences between Genera-
tion X and Generation Lex go on and
on. They have skateboards. We have
sport utility vehicles. They have AIDS.
We have eating disorders. They worry -
about whether or not their body pierc-
ing will get infected. We worry about
whether. or not we’ll get dates to FD.
They watch Clerks. We
watch Clueless.

The great difference is mainly in
attitude. Generation Lex has an
optimism about it that X’ers lack. We

may not have jobs yet, but we’re con-
ﬁdent that we will. And we could get
depressed and worry about it, or we
could go to Goshen and have some
fun. I think that’s because we are ablel‘
to live in a happy bubble for four
years, where everyone knows you,
where you have lots of friends who
care, where people can trust each other, ,
where honesty is reality, and where
parking is one of the biggest concerns.
So, are we hopelessly separated
from the rest of our generation? I be- \
lieve that a connection is still possible)’
Over the Internet (and if that’s not Gen
X, I don’t know what is) I got a for-
ward about being a Child of the Eight-

ies. Our childhood experiences give’

us unity as a generation. I know I
could invite the most hardened slacker
over to my apartment, and we could
have a conversation about early Ma-
donna music andjelly shoes. We could‘
talk about how Star Wars was one of
the coolest movies ever. We’d wax
nostalgic about the Atari 2600. Slacker
Friend might even think I was cool
when she found the autographed pic)‘
ture of B0 Duke from The Dukes of
Hazzard that my fiance Steve put in
the bathroom. (It says, “To Stephen,
Yee Haa!!! John Schneider). I’d do“
my trusty old ALF imitation and we’d'
be fast friends.

So, this summer, if you find your-
self in a Starbucks surrounded by
people your age who seem a lot coolers
than you are, don’t panic. Just start
humming the theme song to The
Smurfs and you’ll be in.

**‘3r of4 stars; nearly incoherent but fun

After all, it is not painful to watch the
movie, and (primarily, I am convinced,
because of the old Mission: Imp
sible theme by Lalo Schifrin)
the action is really cooking, it m
as fast and powerful as anythingever 
has on screen.

The problems, then, are not
whelming. Here they are. The p A s
pretty much incomprehensible. If 9 u
bother to try to follow it, or retra
you will immediately find an inc
sistency. Then you will think, “Wait
Is that really an inconsistency?” Yo
will sit forward in your seat and c
vince yourself something deeper
going on for a second, then realiz 
were right the first time. It was ju
inconsistency. Do not panic. It is ; __
a movie, after all. Something will bl
up soon and that will be fun. Es .,
cially if they play the music. Doot.
Doot! Doot! Doot! Doo-doo-d
Another problem is that few of ,
very, very good actors are utilized
their fullest. Kristin Scott-Tho
Emilio Estevez, Henry Czerny, J ,_
Reno, Emmanuelle Beart, Vi
Rhames, all have range that is ne
explored. And just a little exploratio
might have added some weight
substance to the story that would
it more thanjust a twisty little no
of a film. As it is, though, Crui
competent, and Vanessa Redgra
steals the movie, making Cruise lo
like a choirboy who has been sin
too high for too long.

When you think of Cruise films
this will never top the list. When
thinkofDePalmafilms,thiswillno, r
top the list. When you think ofa ’ n
films, this will nevertopthe list. Wh
you think of ﬁlms made from se‘
popular sixties television series, t
probably would not even make the to
five.

Oh well. You can’t have e
thing, Iguess. Still, you can’t help
feel that a couple of weeks more '
pre-production, a nice quick scr
«rewrite by Quentin Tarantino or V

:rieF.isher or Elaine May, or even 
abit more Lalo Schifrin, take-no

added.

As it is, I would have to say to hea
in with low expectations, don’t think
too much, and make sure to pay mati-
nee price, because it is worth it.

ALEXCHRISTENSEN
P%ihA0wE(hunc

The summer movies are officially upon us,
may heaven be merciful. Don’t get me wrong. I
am looking forward to this season, not just
because of the big—budget studio films like The
Arnold Movie and The Big Reptile Movie and
The Jim Carrey Movie, but also because of some
independents or risk-takers like Trainspotting,
from Danny Boyle, the director of Shallow
Grave, Francis Ford Coppola’s Jack, starring
Robin Williams (“Oh, Ihate that disease!”), and
the star-packed A Time to Kill, which, I am
convinced, will bring a much-deserved Oscar to
Samuel L. Jackson, and I do not even have to see
it to say that.

That is why I was looking forward to Mis-
sion: Impossible, from director Brian DePalma,
the twisted, disturbed man who brought us Car-
rie, The Untouchables, and Carlito’s Way. Un-
fortunately, Mission: Impossible is not up to his
usual standard. Oh, it is certainly watchable,
even entertaining, but there is too much missing
to class it with even his average pictures. Is this
just the burden of being too successful, a big
name? Maybe so, but even factoring this in,
Mission: Impossible is still not much more than
a star-driven, big—budget B movie. The Bonﬁre
of the Vanities offers more pathos and emo-
tional involvement, and MELANIE GRIFFITH
is in it!

There is probably not much reason to be so
down on it. Some have already second—hand

“I only have to take my pants
off this time instead of all my
clothes,” freshman Wes
Armstrong assures potential au-
dience members, referring to
how he shocked many people
with his birthday suit in Noon.

Getting to see Armstrong in
his underwear again is just one
of the motivations for students
to go see the Lenfest Center’s
production of Noises Off this
weekend. Opening tonight, this
“farce about a farce” offers stu-
dents a final laugh before the
reality of exams and graduation
sets in.

“I chose to direct Noises Off
because it so honestly portrays
what really happens in theater,”
explained Director Phaedra

tor and when he saw it, he just
couldn't laugh; it’s so painfully

V V ghost walkers cross the street and enter the quintessential setting for the
sharing’ of ghost-stories. Describing it as the Cadillac of cemeteries, the tour
guide gives a briefhistory of the graveyard on Randolph Street and its residents
“There are some provocatively shaped tombstones here, but we won ’t talk
about that... ” Instead, he tellsthe story ofHatwell sisters who brought the “new
girl ” to the graveyard on a Snipe Hunt: “The creak of the gate was loud enough
to wake the dead. The girls walked through and felt a breeze blow past their
faces. ‘A re you scared, honey ? ’ She was scared enough to wet herIIpants but she
didn ’t say anything... ”
“There ain’t nothing in that cemetery. I don’t believe in nothing like that,”
declares Beau Brown who has lived in Lexington for seventy-ﬁve years. “Dead

 people aren’t goiri’ to hurt you, it’s the live ones you gotta watch out for.”

guide snaps his fingers, creating a flash of light, “remember everything that

Ring-tum Phi Staff Writer

‘ to the Co—op, tired and think

ing about all the work I had
to do in these last couple of weeks.
Then, just before I hit the first step, I
turned my head and noticed a table set
upcovcredwith bagswithblackclothes
stuffed in them. Iwent overforacloser
look. My cap and gown were there. It
seemed to stare at me, telling me,
“Guess what, graduation is around the
corner. Only two weeks left.”

Only two weeks left. The words
whirled around in my head. I must
have been walking through these past
four weeks in a state of disbelief. I
reminded myself occasionally but I
put the thought in the far reaches ofmy
mind. Even when Iwent to my cousin’s
graduation a few weeks ago, I had only
an inkling that I would listen to the
same speeches soon. I had not envi-
sioncd myself walking to get my di-
ploma. I had other things on my mind
like my classes and trying to get ajob.

Then, it hit me. This is it. I’m gradu-
ating. The words brought a mixture of
reliefand anxiety. Everybody asks me,
“So, Michael, what are your plans af-
ter graduation?” They always catch
you at the moment when you really
don’t want to think about that. You
want to continue to live in your little
fantasy world where graduation is far
off in the future.

And I could easily say that when I
was a freshmen. When I arrived on
campus, I could taste the freedom and
maybe even enjoy it as soon as my
uncle and mom left my room. After my

lass ended and I headed down

mom hugged me and cried, after my
uncle shook my hand and let me know
he was there for me if I needed him,
after I saw the car pull away, Ijumped
up and down, savoring this wonderful
thing called college. I could go wher-
ever I wanted; Icould stay up all night;
and I didn’t have to ask anyone for
permission to do anything. Free at
last!

Now, four years later, I still can’t
believe that it’s almost over. Four years
and they pass by so fast. It seems so
long ago and so recent all at the same
time. I’m about to go into the real
world—and it’s not the one on MTV
where young people struggle so hard
in a nice plush apartment in San Fran-
cisco, New York or London. No, this
real world is the one with microwave
food, cheap apartments, rents, and bro-
ken pipes.

Besides that, we are defined as
Generation X, the directionless, the
sloppy slobs of senselessness, the Kurt-
Cobain-suicide-is-solution clones, the
lazy, the apathetic. We’re supposedly
the ones who have been told that things
were bad in the past but now they’re
looking up, that we can get the Ameri-
can dream. But we can also get shot,
get AIDS, get the shattered American
nightmare, get crushed by corporate
downsizing, and get hung by the nice
Social Security and S&L money-drain-
ing gifts we’ve inherited.

Sometimes, I get depressed at the
world that I will thrust myselfinto and
maybe one day rear my children in. I
look at a present and a future of drive-
by shootings and drive—by debates. I
turn on Geraldo and he’s still talking
about O.J. Simpson. I think about the
race problem in this country and won-

gether as brothers and sisters. I try and
decide who to vote for in the Presi-
dential race and come to this conclu-
sion: Perot is an idiot, Dole bores me,
and Clinton consistently confuses me.
And if I vote, will it change anything?
And will the Republicans and Demo-
crats stop tryingto win political points
and talk about the problems of this
country in some constructive way?

Then I look at my cap and gown,
still unopened. I imagine myseIfgrab-
bing my diploma and think of my late
grandmother with tears in her eyes
and a smile on her face. I think about
grabbing that diploma for her, for all
the slaves who were not allowed to
read, for all the mothers and fathers
who sacrificed their own education to
make sure that another generation had
achance, for all those who died so that
I could be free.

I recall this Langston Hughes
poem; “I’ve been scarred and bat-
tered/ my hopes the wind done scat-
tered/ Snow has friz me/ Sun has
baked me/ Seems like between ‘em
they done tried to make me stop laugh-
ing, stop loving, stop livingl But I
don’t care/ I’m still here!” I smile
because I am still here. Sowhen gradu-
ation comes I will have a grin on my
face. As I sit there, Iwill remember all
those nights spent writing papers and
reading books big and small. I will
cherish the conversations I’ve had
with people whether in goodwill or in
anger. I will hold close to my heart the
great times when I laughed and the
bad times when I screamed. Despite
all the obstacles, despite all the frus-
tration, despite everything, I made it
and I’m alive. And usually that’s rea-
son enough to be happy.

be discontentment among the Class
of ‘99.” I believe I can offer an ex-
planation for that. Freshmen every-
where go through some period of dis-
illusionment.Whetherthey are home-
sick or disappointed that the school
has failed to live up to all of their
expectations, most of them find the
ultra-important transition to college
life somewhat difficult. But when ide-
als are displaced by reality, most of us
cope in ways other than byjoining the
quixotic crusade to make Lexington
look like Camelot. I’m not saying we
should never cease striving to im-
prove our system, but we must adopt
a realistic approach.
In conclusion, I want to state that
I believe this dialogue and all other
attempts to improve our school are
worthy endeavors. But I must vehe-
mently disagree with the notion that
there is continuous, widespread dis-
content among freshmen. After three
semesters most of us cherish the insti-
tution and its traditions. As our final
two weeks as freshmen draw to a
close, I think the motto ofthe Class of
1999 should echo Shakespeare, “Now
is the winter of our discontent made
glorious summer.”

W&L WINS TWO OF THREE ODAC
COMM|SSIONER’S CUP AWARDS:

At the ODAC’S annual meeting last week, Washing-
ton and Lee was awarded two Commissioner’s Cup
awards. W&L received the combined men’s and
women’scup and the men’s sports cup. W&Lscored 54
points to top runner-up Hampden-Sydney by 10 points
in the men’s competition. W&L placed a close second
in the women’s contest, losing out to Roanoke College
by 2.5 points. But W&L took the overall competition
from Roanke by 13 points. W&L won its points by
capturing ODAC championships in men’s cross coun-
try, women’s swimming, men’s and women’s tennis,
and volleyball and having runner-up finishes in six
other sports.

FANTUZZI NAMED ODAC’S TOP MALE
SCHOLAH-ATHLETE:

Senior baseball standout Graig Fantuzzi was named

the 1996 winner of the “Doc” Jopson Award as the
ODAC’S top male scholar-athlete.

Fantuzzi played a key role in the Generals’ outstand-
ing season and recent ODAC tournament appearance.
Fantuzzi had a .378 batting average and 17 stolen bases.
He also carries a grade-point average in excess of 4.0
and will graduate as class Valedictorian.

FIVE STUDENTS SELECTED FOR ALL-
ODAC MEN’S LAX TEAM:

The Washington and Lee men’s lacrosse team re-
cently had a league-high five players named to the all-
ODAC first team.

Junior attackman Ande Jenkins was the leading
scorer for the Generals this season, racking up 45 goals
and 19 assists. This will be his second year on the first
team.

Senior attack Russell Croft, senior midﬁelder Adam
Butterworth, senior defenseman Lee Counselman, and
junior defenseman Jay Johnson also recieved ﬁrst team
honors.

General ‘Admission concert held .

BY ANDREA EWING
PHI STAFF WRITER

ashington and Lee’s co-ed a cappella group,

General Admission, performed at the General

Headquarters on Wednesday May 15. The

concert was the last for seniors who started the group in
1992.

Senior Phaedra Cianciulli, co-founder of the group with

Gretchen Hall, stated, “We chose the GHQ because it was

‘ the site of our first concert in the Spring of 1993, and it

allows the audience to get more easily involved.”

The concert began with a version of “I Don’t Know”
adapted especially for the Washington and Lee commu-
nity. Other old favorites were heard as the group contin-
ued. “Jack and Diane” with soloist Erik Christ and
“Istanbul” by They Might Be Giants were received with
smiles and applause. General Admission added a new a
song to their repertoire with “Take on Me” sung by soloist

Denis Riva.

Cianciulli commented, “We sing a lot of 80’s music
because we have a good number of 80’s fans in the group.”

The music was interrupted several times to present skits
for the audience. Various members of the group performed
poetry readings and a commentary on the Speaking Tradi-
tion. Freshman member Charolette Graham commented,
“The group is relaxed and wonderful fun.”

Graham auditioned for General Admission after seeing
them at the Freshman Picnic. Even with the relaxed
atmosphere of the group they still perform traditional
favorites like “Dixie” and “A cappella.”

Cianciulli noted, “A cappella” is a contemporary piece,
but it has the traditional a cappella sound, and it appeals to
the fans of Doo-Wop.”

“The co-ed format of General Admission is a good
representation of the student population of Washington
and Lee,” remarks Cianciulli. Graham pointed out that the
group will be having auditions again in the fall, and she
encourages all interested parties to try out.

Two-sport superstar Schaeffer
completes triumphant final season

P Josephine, from page 6

of winning the unofficial title.

Healthy for the first time since her
freshman year, Schaeffer returned with
avengeance last fall,winningtheSouth
Regional for the third time and captur-
ing her third All-America honor with
a ninth-place showing at nationals.
She completed her cross country ca-
reer with 29 wins in her pocket before
wreaking havoc on the track this win-
ter and spring.

The always-modest Schaeffer
chooses not to dwell on her own ac-
complishments, as satisfying as they
may be. Instead, she is fiercely proud
of how well the teams she has run with
have done, such as the women’s track
team’s two ODAC titles and a second
place finish this year.

“I’ve seen the team grow and come
together and work hard,” she said. “I
hope the program can continue to

ow.”
As for Schaeffer, her next chal-
lenge will come off of the track. The
biology major hopes to become a
physical therapist and has applied to
physical therapy school. She will not
get notified of the decision until July.

Schaeffer is extremely apprecia-
tive of the attention she has received
during her career here.

“lt’s been a real joy for me to
represent this school in running and
all the support I’ve received,”
Schaeffer said. “lt’s much more than
I expected and it really means a lot to
me.”

So, Josephine Schaeffer has
sprinted off into the distance for the
last time. Washington and Lee may
never again see another one like her.

Senior Josephine Schaeffer has competed in cross country
and track with equal success during her career. She earned
a trip to nationals with her strong spring track season.

PHI SPORTS EDITOR

Dare we say it: the best ever?

One would never hear those
words coming out of Josephine
Schaeffer’s mouth, but not many
people would argue with the as-
sertion that she is the best fe-
male athlete to ever set foot on
this campus.

But the good times will end
this weekend as Schaeffer will
step off the track as a Washing-
ton and Lee General for the final
time after four years of demol-
ishing every long-distance track
record in the book.

In fact, Schaeffer cannot even
think of one accomplishment that
outshines the rest. Probably
because there are so many to
choose from.

“l’ve had so many wonderful

experiences,” she said.

Her departure will be a bitter
pill to swallow for everyone who
has seen this senior cross coun-
try and track extraordinaire burn
opposing runners since Fall
1992. Like she does in the 10,000
meters, her favorite race, it
seemed that Schaeffer would
never stop running. But as the
NCAA Outdoor Track and Field
Championships conclude Satur-
day at North Central (IL) Col-
lege, so will Schaeffer’s glori-
ous career.

Schaeffer ran in the 10,000
on Wednesday and ﬁnished elev-
enth in a time of 37.50. Yester-
day, she competed in the pre-
liminaries of the 5000. If she
crosses the ﬁnish line in the top
twelve, she gets a free ticket to
the ﬁnals on Saturday.

This is the first time that
Schaeffer has qualiﬁed for more

than one race at nationals. She
qualiﬁed for the 10,000 in both
1993 and 1995, but never in the
5000.

Schaeffer, who qualiﬁed for
nationals in the 10,000 with a
meet record time of 36:45.7 at
the W&L Invitational on March
16, likes her chances in the
10,000.

“I feel that’s my strongest
race,” she said.

No matter what happens at
nationals, Schaeffer had quite a
track season. After opening the
spring with her meet record in
the 10,000 at home, she shat-
tered her school record time in
the 3000 with a 10:12.2 at the
Battleground Relays on March
30, eclipsing her old record of
10:23.6 in 1993. She followed
that up with another victory in
the 3000 at the Royal Track Clas-
sic on April 20, and then led the
team to a second place ﬁnish at
the ODAC Championships a
week later with her wins in the
1500 and 3000. In the 1500, she
rallied in the ﬁnal 200 meters to
post a school and conference
record time of 4:45 .40, breaking
her old mark of 4:54.7, also set
in 1993.

As if that was not enough for
one year, Schaeffer was estab-
lishing indoor track records dur-
ing the winter. She prevailed in
both the one and two mile runs
in conference record times at the
ODAC Indoor Championships
on February 24 and then became
the first W&L female to com-
pete in the NCAA Indoor Cham-
pionships on March 8-9, ﬁnish-
ing seventh in the 5000 in
17:31 .31 andjust missing an All-
America award.

Schaeffer attributes heramaz-
ing success in 1996 to one thing.

‘‘I think it’s been because I’ve
been running without injuries,”
she said.

As much natural talent as
Schaeffer has, she has never had

the luxury of putting it in cruise
control. Although it seems like
she is a running machine, the
injuries she has suffered during
her career caused her to con-
tinue improving until she
reached a whole new level.

Schaeffer helped bring the
W&L track and cross country
programs to a whole new level.
She entered W&L in the fall of
1992 as a highly-touted fresh-
man after winning the Tennes-
see state championship in the
3200 meter run and ﬁnishing
second in the 1600-meter run
and cross country as a student at
Hutchison High School in Mem-
phis.

But nobody was prepared for
what Schaeffer accomplished
during her freshman year.
She won the Freshman Athlete
of the Year award as she tore up

{:2 '

cross~country records left and
right in the fall, rewriting the
entire W&L record book with
her name on it. She established
a W&L course record time of
18:14, won the regional cham-
pionship and ﬁnished twelfth at
nationals, earning her a ﬁrst-
team All-America award. Not a
bad start while her fellow class-
mates were still trying to ﬁnd
their way around campus.

Things got even better in the
spring of 1993 when Schaeffer
set records in the 1500, 3000 and
10,000. Her 36:31.82 time in
the 10,000 still stands.

Schaeffer rode her success in
the 10,000 into nationals, where
she captured an All-America
award with a stunning second
place ﬁnish in the nation in the
10,000.

It seemed almost impossible

to improve after that kind of a
year, but Schaeffer returned to
cross country in the fall of her
sophomore year and just kept
getting better. She took all nine
meets during the regular sea-
son, shattered the school record
at regionals in 16:46 and cruised
to an eighth-place ﬁnish at na-
tionals, giving her yet another
All-America trophy. By the
end of the season, Schaeffer had
snared 16 of her 19 career races
with two of the losses coming in
the NCAAS, and had run the
twelve fastest times in school
history. Meanwhile, she led the
cross country team to its third
ODAC title in four years. Was
there any stopping the Schaeffer
running machine?

Unfortunately yes. The drain
of continually switching offbe-
tween cross country and track
was beginning to catch up with
her. According to Schaeffer, it
is tough to constantly refocus
on the different sports, not just
the physical grind of running
long-distance races. ,

“I don’t think people realize
how hard it is mentally,” she
said. “I’m very mentally fo-
cused and it takes a lot out of me
to prepare for each race.”

But the grind was draining
her legs too, and that dreaded I-
word ﬁrst surfaced before track
season in 1994. Schaeffer came
down with a knee injury which
was severe enough to force her
to miss the entire track season.

After spending the summer
rehabilitating, Schaeffer shot
out of the gate in cross country
in Fall 1994 by steamrolling the
opposition in her ﬁrst ﬁve meets.
Then disaster struck again.
Schaeffer got a stress fracture in
her left pelvis area and had to
take a month off. She still came
back to ﬁnish fourth at regionals
and qualify for her third straight
NCAA championships.

But at the NCAAS, she re-

aggravated her pelvis injury dur-
ing the race. Despite running in
severe pain and several people
begging her to quit, Schaeffer
could not bring herself to stop
after coming that far. She re-
fused to quit until she crossed
the ﬁnish line. Although she
finished last, the race may have
been more indicative of
Schaeffer’s determination and
competitiveness than any of the
races she won.

Still, by this time, the ques-
tions were popping up. Would
she ever be able to duplicate her
freshman year triumphs?

The injuries planted some
seeds of doubt in Schaeffer’s
mind, too.

“I didn’t really know what to
expect,” she said. “College was
the ﬁrst time l’ve had to go
through that. You certainly have
doubts.”

It would have been easy for
Schaeffer to just walk away from
athletics then and concentrate
more on academics and the other
aspects of college life during her
ﬁnal two years. But Josephine
could not do it. Her body may
have been begging for mercy
but her mind would not let her
quit. Instead, she focused more
and more on improving herself
so she could relive the memo-
ries from earlier times.

“I wanted to continue to work
hard,” she said. And, “it’s got-
ten me into better shape than
before.”

Schaefferstartedworking her
way back into top—ﬁight shape.
She had a modest track season
by her standards in Spring 1995,
although she was crowned
ODAC champion in the 3000
meters and again went to the
nationals in the 10,000. She was
also an integral part in the
women’s first ofﬁcial outdoor
ODAC championship after years

assist to total 37 total points and 2.64 points
per game. Chase, only a freshman, helped
the Generalscompete among strong ODAC
competition and also tallied ﬁve important
game-winning goals, including the only
goal in a 1-0 victory at Shenandoah. Chase
heads up a solid Generals’ soccer team
which will return several key players next

A unanimous selection,
Cam Dyer led W&L in scoring with a 22.2
point average and shot 55.8% from the
field. Dyer also led the team with 7.8
rebounds per game and in blocks with 23.
The center dished out 44 assists and was
named to the ﬁrst team all-ODAC in his
senior campaign. Dyer led W&L in scoring
in 21 of 24 games and achieved career highs
with 41 points against Randolph-Macon
and 3 blocks against Hampden-Sydney.

 

 

ﬂﬂ  A unanimous selection,
Peter Sorensen tallied 74 total points in-

cluding 37 goals with fourtwo-point goals
and 33 assists. Sorensen demonstrated
excellent accuracy shooting at a 40.2 per-
cent clip and also was a force on defense,
compiling 49 steals. Sorensen’s leader-
ship and tenacious play helped lead the
Generals to ten victories this year, includ-
ing a 16-15 victory over the Naval Acad-
emy.

takedowns.

Lagmssgg Ande Jenkins led the team in
total points with 64 and goals scored with
45 as well as placing second in assists with
19. Jenkins was the heart and soul of the
Generals’ offensive attack and helped the
Generals achieve a 10-5 overall record, a
5-1 ODAC record, and a victory over VMI
in the Lee-Jackson Classic. Jenkins scored
eight goals in one game against
Shenandoah and netted six goals against
Guilford.

 

Imgk; Jason Callen also fared well on
the track in the distance races, which have
become his specialty. This was the case
with his second place ﬁnish in the 5000 at
the ODAC Championships in a time of
16:03.46. In doing so, he was a major
contributor in the Generals’ third place
showing. Callen, only a sophomore, will
return for two more years and continue to
propel the Generals to continued strong
ﬁnishes in the ODAC and other meets.

yymsﬂing; A unanimous selection, se-
nior Colin Looney compiled the best over-
all record on the Generals’ wrestling team.
Looney ﬁnished the 1995-96 season with
a 10-9 record for the Generals and helped
Washington and Lee to a 33-15 victory
over Johns Hopkins. Looney, wrestling in
the 190-pound class, did not suffer a pin all
year. He converted one of his own as well
as leading the team in escapes and

' A unanimous selection,
Jason Callen took honors in cross coun-
try with outstanding performances in the
distance events. Callen was Washington
and Lee’s Outstanding Freshman Athlete
last year and was selected as the ODAC
Runner of the Year this year. He was also
named to the all-region team in the fall
after his 26:32 time at the ODAC Cham-
pionships helped lead the Generals to the
ODAC title.

Golf; Junior Tommy Dudley ﬁnished
this season with several strong perfor-
mances, including a score of 153 over 36
holes at the ODAC Championships, and
helped the Generals’ golf team complete
another strong season. Dudley continued
his consistent play and led the team with a
77.9 scoring average. His leadership and
performance on the course provided a
good example for the future of Generals’
golf.

 

Chris MacNaughton held a 7-13 overall
record in Flight 1 singles play and an 11-6
overall record in Flight 1 doubles play.
MacNaughton has been a key contributor
to the Generals’ efforts for four years and
has maintained a high standard of play
each season. Overall, in singles and doubles
play, MacNaughton had a 7-3 tournament
record and helped the Generals to the
NCAA regionals this year.

Slimming; Nathan Hottle continued
his strong swimming efforts to earn a place
at the NCAA Nationals this year and help
the Generals win some key meets this year.
Hottle captured three All-American awards
at nationals with a seventh place in the 200
IM, eighth in the 200 breast and eleventh in
the 100 breast. Hottle consistently placed
among the top swimmers at every meet and
earned a reputation as a formidable oppo-
nent and an exceptional teammate.

 

Eogthau; Brooks Fischer led the Gen-
erals’ offensive attack this year and started
all nine games for W&L this season.
Fischer completed 145 of 245 passes for a
59.2% completion percentage and achieved
a quaterback rating of 115.9. Fischer
completed ten passes for touchdowns, in-
cluding a valiant offensive surge to over-
come a 21-point deficit against Randolph-
Macon. Fischer threw for 1498 yards and
completed a long pass of 60 yards.

 

 ; A unanimous selection, Graig
Fantuzzi broke the school record for runs
batted in and stolen bases this year and led
the Generals to their best ﬁnish in over half
a century at 16-11. Fantuzzi was named an
all-ODAC selection this season and also
holds the school record for batting aver-
age, a .482 in 1994. The Generals’ co-
captain performed a flawless left ﬁeld and
possessed one of the strongest throwing
arms in the ODAC.

W&L Folklore: steeped in
tradition, myth and history

By ANNE.ALvoRD AND
BETHANY BAUMAN
or THE RING-TUM PHI

Washington and Lee, like most 350
year old communities has a rich folklore
all its own. We are proud ofour folklore.
As you come to be familiar with the
campus, you will get to know this folk-
lore the way you know the folklore of
your own community. We have legends
to explain most everything. Let us start
to familiarize you with some of them.

Why is Traveller buried in the
Front Lawn?

When Traveller first died, he was not
buried but stuffed. However, General
Lee’s faithful companion had a habit of
showingup where he didn'tbelong, most
likely due to the pranks of mischeivious
students, so he ws buried in the Front
Lawn. His grave is located next the the
chapel.

Why do we have a statue of
Cyrus McCormick? I

McCormick, inventer of the reaper,
was a resident of Rockbridge County
and a great supporter and benefactor of
education.

Why are the doors to the Lee
Hosue garage always open?

This is not so that everyone knows
that President Elrod drives a Volvo. The
garage was originally a stable and was
the last home ofTrave1ler, who of course
came to Lexington with Lee when he
becamepresident of the school (then
Washington College) after the Civil War.
The doors are left open so thatTraveller’s
spirit could come and go as it chooses.

What is theCadaver Society?

The Cadaver Society is an anony-

mous organization that gives a great
deal of financial support to the uni-
versity,aswellasputingflyersaround
campus several times a year.
Although we cant be sure who the
Cadaver Society is, we believe it is
made up of alumni and current stu-
dents. The
footbri d ge,

Why do all W&L students have
to pass a swim test?

This may be a question that is al-
ready plauging some of you. The story
goes that the Doremuses were passing
through Lexington one day visiting and
met a student who volunteered to show

them around. The
student laid his books

which leads to
the athletic
fields and Law
School, was
donated by the
Cadaver Soci-
ety.
Bytheway,
did you know
that our foot-
bridge is the
longest non-
suspension
footbridge in
the world?
Why are

How did FD
start?

Annie Jo Robertson White, the Uni-
versity Librarian at the time,and the
woman after whom our library catalog
system is named, started the tradition of
FD in 1907.

She had directed a student play to raise
money for a student organization and had
raised $44 more than she had promised
the organization, so she decided to use the
extra money for a small student dance,
which would be a costume ball. She sent
out invitations and required that students
must pay $2 for their costumes. Those
who could not afford costumes could
work for them.

Admission to the ball was free and
music was provided by an orchestra from
VMl.

Atthetime,theadministration was not
so permissive ofsuch ‘frivilous’ things as
student dances. Students were required
to be in class the following day at 9 a.m.
with all assignments complete.

Incidentally, the approximate cost of
FD in recent years has been $80,000.

What was Tucker Hall origi-
nally? Tucker Hall origninally housed
the Law School. The building was ex-
tremely unattractive, an eyesore to the
otherwise breathtaking collonade. The
building was destroyed by fire, and the
story goes that because the building was
so incredibly ugly students were ‘lining
up to take credit for the deed’.

The cm W:

A drooling, pathetic sequel

BY ALEX CHRISTENSEN
PHI MovIE CRITIC

71}: Half a star out of four
The pitch: “lt’ll be
like...um...The Crow.”

1994’s The Crow, starring
the late Brandon Lee, contained
many very specific pleasures.
Lee’s acting was wonderful, the
concept of a truly “dark” super-
hero——-so dark he’s already
dead——was original and inter-
estingly handled. The film also
used miniatures, cityscapes, and
fast-paced action shots to create
a film with a deep mood and
texture. Of course, there were
some hokey elements, such as
the plucky little heroine (Roch-
elle Davis), the almost inexcus-
ably over-the-top villains
(Michael Wincottand Bai Ling),
and Ernie Hudson. Still and all,
the stunning visual elements
combined with some genuine
emotional impact to produce a
very affecting and entertaining
film that, largely because of the
death of star Brandon Lee dur-
ing shooting, has been labeled a
“cult classic.”

This is not a review of The
Crow, ofcourse, but a review of
its pathetic, drooling sequel, The
Crow: City of/lngels. When the
first news about this movie sur-
faced, it seemed like a terrible
idea to some and an exciting one
to others: bring back the Crow
character and basically the same
plot with a new actor and try to
reproduce some of the success,
both artistically and commer-
cially, of the first film.

So there are two ways to look
at it. First, does it succeed in
reproducing any of what The
Crow did? And second, does it
stand alone, avoiding being too
derivative of the original or de-
void of its own character as
a film?

As far as the first question,
the answer, unfortunately, is a
resounding no. The second an-
swer is no, too. Didn’t want to
keep anybody in suspense. This
Crow is deeply, deeply bad. The

screenplay, credited to David S. _
Goyer, seems like it was written ’

by the proverbial thousand mon-
keys at typewriters. Basically, a
guy and somebody he loves (Eric
Draven’s girlfriend in The Crow,
Ashe Corven’s son in City of

Angels) get killed by a bunch of
punk-rocker/occultistdrug deal-
ers, and the fellow comes back
as a mime-faced killer ghost es-
corted by a spirit guide in the
shape of a crow. Hence the name.
But Goyer wasn’t satisfied with
just this straightforward sce-
nario; he cluttersthe screen with
portentously named loser drug
dealers and pseudo-mythologi-
cal weirdos and sets the whole
thing in an apparently plague-
ravaged L.A., for no other rea-
son than that he wants to mix in
the celebration of the Day of the
Dead, a plot device so extrane-
ous that I will say no more
about it.

This Crow is
deeply, deeply bad.
The screenplay,
credited to David S.
Goyer, seems like it
was written by the
proverbial thousand
monkeys at typewrit-
ers.

Goyer also mixes up the
timeline, a device that can be
used to reveal character and ex-
plore connections in a more com-
plex story, but which here just

the first film, now played by Mia

She lives in this big dank loft
and paints depressing pictures
and lights candles. Then she
starts dreaming about this guy

drowning. Well, in fact, he has ,.

drowned. He’s the new Crow!
Surprise! Withholding informa-
tion from the audience that they
already know coming into the
theater is just plain -dippy. And-

Crow goes to kill all these folks
who killed him and his little son.

‘ The Student Voice of Washington and Lee University
Founded September 18, 1897

Now that you’ve arrived

i
To the students...

Welcome to Washington and Lee. We’re pretty sure you’ve

. ‘heard that a few times already, but we really are glad you’re here.

Don’t be so cynical. If we weren’t glad you were here, we would

have made you move your own things into the dorm. The FOC

wouldn’t have planned a week of activities for you and Dean

1 Manning wouldn’t know all of your names and most of your home
towns.

You deserve to be here. You’re intelligent, talented, accom-
plished, honored, and have frighteningly high test scores. But
you’re not just great applications and good essays, you’re
interesting people to know. Your job this week is to get to know
eachother, as well as returning students. Sounds easy, doesn’t it?
Really, it isn’t very hard, but it is a lot of work. We’ll try to get to
know you, but you have to help. Get involved on campus right

‘away. Follow the speaking tradition. Go out and meet people.
This week is one of the only chances you’ll have to do that without
having to worry about going to class and getting work done too.

.5 Take advantage of it.

A One reason you came to W&L was probably because you
wanted to be challenged. With the great classes, great social life

, and huge array of extra-curricular activities available at W&L,

" you are going to be challenged. There are countless opportunities
here. Take classes that interest you. Say hello to everyone you
pass on the hill. Get to know your professors. Learn the art of
working hard and playing hard. Join organizations. All of these
elements are essential to the Washington and Lee education.
Don’t let yourself miss out.

For now, be happy you’re here. The summer is over and the day

* you’ve been awaiting for months is here. Take just a minute and
be really proud of yourself. Now get back to moving into your
room and saying good-bye to your parents. Speaking of your

’, parents...

To the parents...

We’ll be honest with you. We have no idea what you’re feeling

’ right now. But we’ll tell you what we do know: we know you’re

probably scared, excited, proud, anxious and maybe wondering

how your child, who you can’t remember making his own bed
without being reminded, is going to live on his own.

Your “little boy” or “little girl” is going to grow up a lot in the
next few months. Scary, isn’t it? By the next time you see him or
her, there will be a whole side to your child that you’ve never seen

4 before. There will be a ‘person in your child’s body that gets
himself up for class at ungodly hours of the morning, does his own
ironing, gets his homework done on time all by himself, and
voluntarily eats vegetables. That’s something to be even prouder
of than your “Washington and Lee Mom” and “Washington and
Lee Dad” t-shirts.

   

t
. wt, ,
‘*’ Your child is here because Washington and Lee knows he can
handle everything that’s about to happen to him. You know it too,
‘‘ and so does your child. Maybe it won’t be easy going the whole
way, but with a child old enough to be going to college, you already

know that much better than we do.

K. There might be weekends where your child doesn’t call, or
weeks where there’s not a letter in the mailbox. That doesn’t mean
there’s something wrong. More than likely, it means everything
is great. W&L is a busy place for everyone, but add to that all the

,4 stress of the first semester — meeting people, learning to deal with
professors and figuring out what days it’s really best not to eat in
the dining hall —— and you’re lucky to get any sleep at all.

‘ Have faith,. It’s going to be fine. Take eight rolls of film before
‘you leave Lexington. Show your “My kid goes to Dubyuhne1l”
keychain to everyone in the office. By the time you’re done
looking at all of the pictures you took and everyone has seen your
keychain, your “little man” or “little woman” is going to be home

‘V for break.

Somany new freedoms, so little time

Green Land
Betsy Green, ’97

It’s always so hard to decide what
to say in the freshman issue. All of
you are still forming your first impres-
sions of W&L and of college in gen-
eral. There’s so much that I could say
to you, even beyond the “Hi, what’s
your name? So where are you from?
Where do you live?” that you’ll be

hearing so much of in the next week, , _

but I don’t know where to start. I
know this sounds cheesy, but you are
startinga great adventure. I remember
my freshman year so vividly. More
than anything, l remember what an
unbelievably cool place l thought
Washington and Lee was. Here are
son1e of the highlights:

l. Class schedule. I had no
idea, in high school, that I would ever
have the opportunity not to have class
every day. Fall term my freshman

' year I had no classes on Tuesdays or

Thursdays. And my earliest class was
a 9 a.m. P.E. class. Wow.

2. Lexington Night Life.
Who knew there was one? Yet every
night there was new entertainment to
be found, new places to see, people to
meet. Included in that, of course,
were...

3. Older boys talking to
me. Don’t ever feel you have to
apologize for being a mere freshman.

You are new, exciting and exotic.
Women, I hope you are smart enough
to know that those older boys talking
to you are hoping to impress you with
the fact that they are, well, older boys
talking to you. They may be trying to
exploit your freshman naiveté. My
freshman year hallmates were on to
that and decided to use it to our advan-
tage, compiling a list of Pickup Lines
For Freshman Women (do any of you
remember this, ex-hallmates?).
Among them were such gems as, “If
only I could find a way to forget my
ex-_boyfrie_nd,f’. “_l,’ve‘_n‘ever_been in a
fraternity house before,” “My parents
wouldn’t let me date in high school,”
and the classic, “l’m young, innocent
and far away from home.”

4. Change in proximity to
parents and friends. In high school,
your old life, you lived with your
parents and visited your friends,. In
college you live with your friends and
visit your parents. And ideal setup.
Anytime you wantcompany, go down-
stairs and see one of your new bud-
dies. Siton one ofthe benches outside
Graham-Lees anytime to talk about
anything or nothing.

5. Freedom, sweet free-
dom. Nolonger do you have to worry
about getting home on time. Now it
doesn’t matter to anyone but you if
you go home at all. do you want to
have cereal fordinner? Go right ahead.
Getatattoo. Pierce something. Grow
your hair long. Don’t go to class next
week. lf you want to do any of those
things, no one’s going to stop you.

Granted, none of these things is a good
idea, and you’ve probably already ﬁg-

ured that out, but isn’t it cool that if '

you wanted to, you could?

to college, all a place like this really
had to offer me was makeup and tooth-

student, whole new sections opened

me feel so sophisticated. And why not

Miriello’s Generals begin season with a “Never Quit” attitude

BY BETHANY BAUMAN
PHI Sronrs EDITOR

If your opponents are bigger,
stronger, and faster, you have to
work harder, longer, and smarter.

winningthe September 14th sea-

 

And just so you ‘don tjthmk we re‘ forgetting a V ut the 
men’s soccer freshmen...Final cuts are tomorrow  we _

son home opener against Ursinus
College.

Head coach Frank Miriello
will be looking to his corps of
skill position players, which re-
mains almost intact from a year
ago, to lead the team this season.
Junior Brooks Fischer returns to
the quarterback position, where
last year he won all—conference
honors. Fischer will be backed
up by junior Tommy Ruegger
and freshman Christian
Batcheller.

Ruegger may also play a role
in the receiving corps, which
has a large hole to fill after los-
ing ’96 graduate James Urban,
who led the Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference in receiving last
year with 32 receptions. Junior
Nick Hodge and sophomore
Chas Chastain also return for
the Generals’ offense at the
wideout positions. Hodge

 

should make a major contribu-
tion, after snagging 28 catches
last year. Chastain led the Gen-
erals in scoring for the ’95 sea-
son with six touchdowns, how-
ever, returns this year after hav-
ing knee surgery in the spring.
He has had some trouble with
the knee during the pre-season,
but no conclusions have been
made about his status for the
beginning of the regular sea-
son. Senior Jake Buckner has
been moved from the fullback
position to wide receiver.
Rounding out the receiving
corps will be tight ends senior
Jon Gardner and sophomore
David Ritchey. Freshman J.T.
Malatesta has impressed
Miriello and could possibly see
sometimeinareceiverposition
this season.

W&L’s backfield looked
strong coming into the pre-sea-
son,buthas hitafew snags over
the last two weeks. Junior
tailback standout Seth
McKinley has been sidelined
for what will most likely be the
first three games of the season
following foot surgery last
week. He will be replaced by
seniorJohn Marshall and sopho-
more Floyd Young, two talented
players, but ones who do not
have the same level of experi-
encethat McKinley has. Sopho-

more Lee Swomley has also been
moved over from his defensive
position to help out in the offen-
sive backfield. The backﬁeld
will be anchored by senior quad-
captain Aaron Wilkinson, who
returns to the fullback position
after catching 22 passes for 200
yards, and running 57 times for
237 yards last season.

The strength of the Generals
passing game will depend on the
offensive line. Last year, the line
graduated four players who had
started for at least three years.
Junior center Stefan Neumeister
is the only returning starter to
this unit. However, with seniors
Ed Zelezen, Will Hill and Matt
May and sophomore Marc
Granger, what the o-line may lack
in experience it makes up for in
determination and skill. Miriello
is also pleased with the pre-sea-
son performance of freshmen
John Sensing and Jady Koch on
the o-line.

On the defensive side, the
Generals should be strong, de-
spite the loss of ’96 graduate All-
American tackle Robert Hull.
The defensive line will be ‘led by
senior quad-captain Peyton Wil-
liams, who will switch to tackle
this year after playing at
noseguard last season. Junior
Omar Moneim willbe at the other
tackle position. Takingwilliams’

place at noseguard is senior Neil
Kelleter, provided that he is able
to overcome minor injuries sus-
tained in the pre-season. Junior
John Thrall will back Kelleter at
the nose. The future of the d-
line looks good with this year’s
additions of freshmen Scott King
and Bill McGettigan.

Probably the strongest ele-
ment ofthe Generals’ defense is
a solid group of inside lineback-
ers. Senior Travis Wisdom and
senior quad-captain McGuire
Boyd will lead this group. Both
have seen time on the field since
their freshman year. The line-
backers have also acquired a nice
addition this season in freshman
Mike Moore.

The defensive backﬁeld may
be a cause for concern this sea-
son in that it lacks depth.
Cornerback junior Ryan
Fletemeyer will lead will lead
the group. Junior John Benazzi
and senior Brian Zagol should
both see time at the other corner
position. A bigger concern for
Miriello is the lack of experi-
ence at the safety position. Jun-
ior Lee Miller and senior Chris
Watson are slated to start, with
juniorJeff McKenna and sopho-
more Trey Carr backing them
up.
Despite a few areas of con-
cern, Miriello isoptimistic about

the upcoming season. He and
hiscoachingstaffarebeing more
demandingoftheirplayers,call-
ing for attention to detail and a
“One fail, we all fail” attitude.

as well as posting a winning
record this season. According
to Miriello, “They are really or

to the forward line will be se-
nior tri-captain Michelle
Bauman,juniors Erica Reineke
and Leighton Kirby, and sopho-
more Karin Treese. Bauman is
W&L’s all-timeleading scorer
and earned first team All-
ODAC and third team All-
South honors last year. Reineke
set the school record in 1994
for points in a season with 47,
but was forced to miss part of
last season with an injury.
Treese garnered second team
all—conference honors last sea-
son after tallying 14 goals and
10 assists, making her the sec-
ond leading scorer in the

 

ODAC. Kirby wasasecondteam
All-ODAC pick last season as
well. Junior Christy Meade and
sophomore Caroline Keen should
also see time at the forward posi-
tion.

Keen and Kirby will lend
their talents to the midfield in
addition. Already combining for
a strong corps at that position are
senior Allison Warner, junior
Claire Bowers, and sophomore
Elizabeth Ritchey.

The depth of the women’s
soccer team does not stop with
the offense. The defensive unit
returns last year’s freshman
standout Nicole Johnson. John-
son was a first team All-ODAC
and third ‘team All-South pick
last season. Adding experience
to the backline are sophomores
Lauren Francis and Kelly Norton,
junior Lorraine Taurassi, and se-
niorstri-captain Sara Benson and
Lamandra Jenkins. In addition,
Hathorn is also looking for fresh-
man defender Ginny Gernigan to
make an impact this season.

In the goal cage this season
for the Generals will be senior
tri-captain Beth Mozena. She
has recorded 13 shutouts in her
career at W&L and allows on
average only 1 .34 goals per game.
Freshman Stephanie McKnight
willback Mozenaupatthegoalie
position.

The biggest challenge for
Hathorn’s squad will be ﬁnding
what combination of these tal-
ented women will be most effec-
tive.

Men’s head soccer coach
Rolph Piranian is also dealing
with a very talented team this
year. Fourteen players from last
year's squad who saw the field in
at least ten games have returned,
hoping to improve on last

season’s 7-9 record. Piranian
will be loking for another big
year from sophomore forward
Sam Chase. As a freshman,
Chase tallied 18 goals and 37
points, both single—season W&L
records. He was the ODAC’s
leading scorer and earned sec-
ond team all-conference hon-
ors. Also returning to the for-
ward line this season are junior
Gordon Meeker and senior Dave
Corning. Meeker had two goals
and six assists in 1995, making
him the second leading return-
ing scorer on this year’s squad.
Corning will split his time be-
tween the front and the midfield
this season. Freshman Jamie
Parker has stood out in the pre-
season at the forward position
and is expected to see serious
playing time. Another new ad-
dition to the front line is sopho-
more transfer Jeff Weikel, who
played for Virginia Tech in
1994. Piranian hopes to see the
scoring spread out among these
players this year, as opposed to
concentrating just on Chase.

The midfield is one of two
areas of concern for Piranian.
Stepping upto ﬁllthegap left by
graduation wll be seniors Andy
Dater and Mike Matechak, and
sophomore Jon Wright. Several
freshmen midfielders have im-
pressedPiranian,includingMike
Kaczka.

The Generals defense looks
extremely strong going into the
regular season. Sophomore tri-
captain sweeper Mikel Parker
will lead the back field this year.
Parker was selected to the ﬁrts
team All-ODAC and the second
team All-South after his incred-
ible first season. The Generals’
defense will be rounded out by
juniors tri-captain Colin

received an All-ODAC honor-
able mention last year while
Sigler moved up to the number
four spot on W&L’s all-time

defense this year will be former
midfielder Mike Germain.
Germain has put in a commend-
able performanceinthe midfield
for the past two years, but will
now try to add to the Generals’
defensive talent pool. Fresh-
man Ben Thompson will also
make his debut on the defense
this year and is expected to chal-
lenge for playing time.

The second question mark fc
the team concerns the goalie:
Three goal keepers left the tear

Hottle, are W&L’s top returning players. They will lead the
squad through a tough Collegiate Water Polo Association

with Navy and Richmond. Head coach Page Remillard will be
looking for strong performances from the freshmen, especially
goalie Ryan Noble who could be a big addition to the squad.

The volleyball team also adds six freshmen to its roster this
season. In 1995, the team captured the school's first ODAC
volleyball championship. The Generals will be looking not
only to retain their ODAC title this season, but to move up in the
NCAA South region rankings. Junior middle blocker Hilary
Martin is the top returner for W&L. She will co-captain the
team with senior middle blocker Virginia Yocrg. Outside
hitters Holly Thomsen and Megan Snodgrass in addition to
setters Alison Beard and Lee Ann Gschwind will be offensive
threats for-the Generals. Add to this mix freshmen Carolyn
Carson, Sarah Ellis, Lindsay Gatling, Megan Macy, Martha
Pettyjohn, and Nancy Reinhart and W&L volleyball could be
looking at a big boost in its NCAA South regional ranking.

Swipe your
way to safety:

, BY LIZ DETTER

PHI STAFF WRITER

It’s Wednesday night. A
student makes his way to the
door of Woods Creek West
Apartments. He is tired after a
long night of partying. He pulls
on the door handle, anticipating
the warm comfort of sleep
awaiting him. But what is this?
The door is locked! He mutters
an expletive under his breath and
pounds on the door, but to no
avail. If only he had his
University Card! Oh well, he
thinks as he vaults onto a first
floor balcony, calmly strides
through the empty common room,
lets himself into the main hall of
the building, and climbs the stairs
to his apartment.

This scenario actually
occurred. The new security
system in Woods Creek and
Gaines Hall has led to some
creative solutions to the
predicament of being locked out.

WASHINGTON & LEE UNIVERSITY

The security system
installation began last year with
the freshmen dorms. Over the
summer, an identical card-
swiping system was installed at
the main entrances to the
upperclass residences. This was
the second phase of the
implementation of a more
comprehensive security system
on W&L’s campus.

In, the pa_st, the University
had been concerned with the
security of the dorms. W&L Chief
of Security Mike Young said, “I
felt, and the Dean of Students
felt, we were not providing the
security we should for the
students. The extension of the
University “One-Card” was an
easy jump.”

The card-swipe system is
designed to limit access to
University housing to members
of the W&L community. It is
very simple. Just swipe your
University Card, wait’for the
green light, the door unlocks, and

re-locks behind you. The trick is
to have a University Card.
What about pizza delivery?
Young said, “What we anticipated
was going to be a problem last year
was not. People that wanted pizza
just had to meet [the delivery guy] .”
Sophomores are accustomed
to the system, and got into the
habit of carrying their University
cards as freshman. It’s no big
deal to them, nor will it be to the
Class of 2000. With a shrug of
her shoulders, sophomore Laura
Cohen said, “We’re used to it; we
did it last year. We know we can’t
live without our cards.”
Juniors and seniors are
having more difficulty adjusting
to the new system. Marisa Frost,
a junior, said, “It’s a chafe. I
appreciate the concern for our
safety, but I don’t see the
necessity. I’m sure it will cut
down on thefts, but when I forget

my card, it’s a pain to bang on the
door.”

According to Young, thefts
were not the primary reason for
the extension of the system. “We
weren’t thinking about that. We
were thinking about extending all of
ourhousingunderthesamesystem.”

Nonetheless the benefits are
evident. Young said, “Two years
ago we had 30 instances of theft
from [freshman] dorm rooms.
Last year we had 2 instances.”

Junior Celeste Rasmussen,
an R.A. in Gaines expressed
feeling safer this year. “Last year
there were random people from
town who would wander through
thehalls,diggingtlu*oughtrashcans.
Although all the bugs aren’t worked
out, I still it’s a good system.”

According to Young, “We’re
working to adjust those
problems.” Last year, one of the
glitches was that library copy

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

cards unlocked the doors. This is
no longer the case. The back
doors of Woods Creek West and
Central are currently being
replaced and outfitted with new
locks. Additionally, doors that
work slowly are being adjusted.

As part of the security
system, emergency phones were
installed outside Woods Creek
Central and beneath the
Gatehouse in Gaines. This brings
the number of security phones
up to 4. These phones can be
used to call security, or to buzz
someone to let you in.

The card-swiping system, is
the wave of the future at W&L.
The openness and accessibility of
the campus have been strong selling
points of the school. The new system
runs in tandem with those ideas.

Although no formal plans
have been made, the law school,
the library, and computer labs

Security system added to upperclass housing

are possible sites for future
security systems. Fraternity
houses, which are campus-
owned, may not be immune,
either. Young stated, “It’s
something that’s in my mind and
has been discussed.”

Lexington seems very safe,
and some students came here
trying to escape the worries of
the real world. However, after
reports of theft and the occasional
“Peeping Tom,” it appears that
Lexington is not quite so idyllic.

Young encourages students
to lock their doors. Students can
reach the security office 24 hours
a day at x8999, and should call
any time they feel hesitant to
walk home, or see anyone
suspicious lurking about.

And remember—the
University One-Card——don’t
leave home without it, unless you
want to break in to your building.

SCC votes to morph into SJC

BY RACHEL Gonpu

PHI STAFF WRITER
t’s not often that someone
decides it is time for change
here at Washington and Lee, but that
day has finally arrived for the Student Con-
duct Committee. This decision was prompted
by the vision of SCC Chair Robert Covington
'97 as well as the University’ s desire to break
away from it’s hard drinking, hard partying
national reputation.

The plans for the future are radical, and
not just by W&L standards. The Student
Conduct Committee which deals with infrac-
tions such as hazing, vandalism, and fight-
ing will be renamed the Student Judicial
Council (SJ C). In order to make the hearing
process more efficient the SJC will follow a
plethora of new rules as dictated in the Blue
Book. Similar to the Executive Committee’s
White Book, the Blue Book outlines penal-
ties for most digressions from gentlemenly
conduct. Like the White Book, the SJC’s own
version of Crime and Punishment will be

available for students to read soon and is
already beingused to ease the transition from
the Student Conduct Committee to SJ C.

In the past, the existing committee has
not always exercised its authoriy and the
administration has intervened. The new sys-
tem hopes to change all that and bring back
more “students governing students.”

The SJC will be staffed by four elected
justices, one from each undergraduate class,
and the three law school class presidents, an
SJ C chair and secretary elected by student
body. These nine people will be voting mem-
bers of the committee. In addition to the
nine voting members, four permanent advis-
ers, the Head Dorm Counselor, Head Resi-
dence Assistent, the Heads of the Interfra-
ternity Council and Panhelenic, will also sit
on the committee.

“[The permanent advisors‘] input is de-
signed to raise the level of SJC decisions and
maintain the highest sense of justice in SJC
decision,” Paul Saboe, current SCC secre-
tary explained.

Unlike the current system, undergradu-

ate class officers will not be involved in the
hearing of conduct cases. The issue of what
will happen to class officers has not been
resolved yet.

The new program seems to benefit both
the accused and the council. Students, by
reading the Blue Book, will have a better
idea of what they can expect and board
members will have an easier time deciding
their fate. The entire overhaul centers around
the fact that specific guidelines for each
infraction are already known in advance.
This will make the system stronger, easier
and more efficient.

Discussions have already begun with
campus leaders to inform them of what is
going on and to take into consideration their
ideas. In late October it is expected that the
proposal will go to the Student Affairs Com-
mittee and if it succeeds there, will travel to
the faculty for final approval. If all goes as
planned by many hard working W&L‘ers,
the SJC will be a reality in fall 1997.

Now...don’t you wish you hadn’t thrown
that last beer bottle???

1996 Convocation
Initiates new tradition

BY DAVID BALSLEY

PHI STAFF WRITER
11 Wednesday, Septem
ber 11, Washington
and Lee University ini-
tiated the 1996-1997 academic
year by hosting Opening Convo-

cation. This year’s convocation,

unlike the Convocations of pre-
vious years, was open to all stu-
dents. Although the Front Lawn
had been the intended sight of
Opening Convocation, the event
was moved to the Warner Cen-
ter.

Until the mid-1960s, Open-
ing Convocation was open to all
students. However, for the past
three decades, only seniors and
representative law students were
invited to the event.

This year, President John W.
Elrod re-established the tradi-
tion of inviting all students to
Opening Convocation. Elrod
based his decidion on his belief
that “a university-wide occasion
to remind ourselves of our pur-
pose as a university” should be
open to the whole school. Look-
ing to the future, Elrod com-
mented that Opening Convoca-
tion will be open to the whole
university each year. He added
that he would like to make con-
vocations, which would be open
to all students, “regular
occurences” at W&L.

Elrod, in conference with the V

faculty and administration of
W&L, selected Paula P. Brownlee
to speak at this year’s convoca-
tion. Brownlee is the current
President of the Association of
American Colleges and former
President of Hollins College.
Brownlee was reccomended to
Elrod by Linda Lorima.
Approximately seven hun-
dred and fifty students, faculty
members, and visitors swarmed
into the Warner Center to hear

Brownlee speak on the value of a
liberal arts education. Elrod
stated that he was “pleased with
the freshman attendance, and
with the senior attendance,” and
that he was pleased that a num-
ber of sophomores and juniors
were present at convocation.
Elrod summed his impressions
of the turnout at Opening Convo-
cation by commenting that at-
tendance was “quite good.” In
addition, Dean of Students David
L. Howison praised the Class of
2000, stating, “What was excep-
tional was the attendance by the
freshmen.”

Elrod bemoaned the neces-
sity of moving Opening Convoca-
tion from the Front Lawn to the
Warner Center. “It is always
desirable to have university
events which involve the whole
University on our picturesque
campus,” Elrod stated. “The
Front Lawn, with Lee Chapel in
the background, is a natural am-
phitheater.” Elrod continued,
“The Warner Center is noisy and
hot and a great place to play
basketball, but no place for an
opening convocation.” Sharing
Elrod’s sentiment, Howison
stated that “having it inside
changed the character of the Con-
vocation.”

Opening Convocation was
followed by a dinner sponsored
by the President’s Office and ca-
tered by Washington and Lee
University Dining Services.

Elrod praised the hard work
of Brian Shaw and Holt Mer-
chant, to whom he gave credit for
planning all the details of Open-
ing Convocation. Elrod also ex-
pressed his great appreciation
for all the work that Buildings
and Grounds and Dining Ser-
vices did in preparing for the
event. The speed and efficiency
of these groups, Elrod stated, was
highly commendable.

Things to do in

Lexington
when it's dead

GreenLand
Betsy Green ’97

I stayed in Lexington all sum-
mer. About half an hour after
graduation last June, just about all
of the students cleared out. A dog
could have taken a nap in the middle
of main street and would have been
undisturbed until the law students
came back.

In spite of the fact that Lexing-
ton is rather, er, quiet in the sum-
mer, there were a lot of ways to
keep myself amused here.

For one thing, I worked a lot. I
gave tours for the admissions of-
fice. So ,in essence, I spent most of
my summer walking backwards

“The most
fun you can
have . . .
in Virginia.”

while high school students fol-

lowed me around asking questions.
And what questions they were.

There are some really weird people
out there. Like the guy who wanted
to know how many acres of land
W&L has. Yeah, an important
factor in any college decision. I
assured him there’s plenty of room
for everyone. One dad asked me
several technical questions about
the computers in our labs, perhaps
thinking his son would use them
for something other than writing
papers or e-mail. After telling him
for the ﬁfth time, “I don’t know,

but I’d be happy to direct you to ‘

University Computing,” I gave up
and told him that most of the com-
puters were either grey or beige
and that was all I knew.

A lot of sticky questions came
from overprotective parents. I think
I have finally come up with a good
way to answer The Alcohol Ques-
tion that is honest, yet doesn’t make
us look like drunken heathens. A
lot of parents asked me about smok-
ing, panic-stricken that any smoke
might enter Junior’s lungs. Some
of them were supposedly severely
allergic to smoke. If that’s the
case, they are going to be screwed
wherever they go for the rest of
their lives.

Some parents went so far as to

worry about how the kid would
get to the airport without a univer-
sity-certified shuttle service.
Rather than sending their kids to
W&L, where they can learn to
take care of themselves, these par-
ents should keep their kids locked
up like veal, safe from the outside
world.

I had to laugh at people who
asked me detailed questions about
our placement in graduate schools
for Korean Footwear studies or
something. Supposedly, these kids
already know what they are going
to do with the rest of their lives.
Hello? They’re only seventeen!
I’m not sure I want to do, but at
least I know that.

One thing’s for sure; work was
never boring (ask me sometime
about the tour I gave to a priest).
And I can walk backwards like a
champ.

When I wasn’t walking back-
wards, there were still ways to
have fun here. My favorite thing
to do was go to the different fairs
around here. My fiancée Steve
and I lost at bingo at the Buchanan

fair, and watched girls with big
hair fight with their boyfriends.

The Lexington fair was also a lot
of fun. Many of the stuffed ani-
mals to be won were red bulldogs,
just like Red Dog beer. Why isn’t
someone in Congress protesting
this marketing idea? But the most
spectacular sights to see were at
the Salem fair. People came in
from the mountains and made the
Salem fair their vacation. And at
the Salem fair, Steve and I saw one
of the oddest things ever.

We went into a free informa-
tion booth which featured fun facts
about ostriches. How fast they

run, how-big their eggs are, things,

like that. At theend, we saw live
ostriches, running around in their
pen. We were then given a coupon
for the stand next door, which sold
ostrich meat. Whose idea was
that? Were people supposed to
learn about ostriches and think,
“y’know, that sounds tasty?”
Could we have chosen our own
ostrich, like a lobster? There were
commercials for weeks for the
Salem fair. The jingle promised
that it was, “the most fun you can
have. . . in Virginia.” I should
have never doubted it.

I’d recommend a summer in
Lex Vegas to anyone. Nothing
beats walking backwards eating
an ostrich burger.

Minimum wage, minumum pay 

 

Joshua Heslinga ‘98

Just this year, I became a work-
study here at Washington and Lee.
This past spring, the opportunity
presented itself, and I figured that I
could certainly use a little extra
money to cover expenses that were
substantially higher than they
would have been at home.

So you can imagine my excite-
ment, and I’m sure many of you felt
the same way, upon hearing that
the increase in the minimum wage
had passed. The extra money was
practically in my bank account al-
ready.

Now, I should say that I’m a
conservative Republican. Had I
been in Congress, I would have
voted against raising the minimum
wage, but upon initial examina-
tion, I figured that as long as it had
already been raised, why continue
to cry over spilled milk when I’m
one of those people who will real-
ize the increase?

You may remember at the time
of debate, Democrats in Congress
trumpeted the measure, saying that
it would finally give struggling
Americans a“living wage.” (Never
mind that in the two years in which
they controlled Congress and the
White House, they never saw the
need to “help” Americans in this

way.) They also demonized Re-
publicans who favored a small-
business exemption, designed to
reduce the number of jobs lost and
businesses closed because of the
increase.

Bill Clinton used the occasion
to chide Bob Dole for not wanting
to give American workers more
money, despite the fact that in the
February 6, 1995 issue of Time
magazine, Clinton argued that an
increase in the minimum wage, “is
the wrong way to raise the income
of low-wage earners.”

While many Republicans agreed
that this made good policy (or
maybe political?) sense, another
group, led by House Majority
Leader Dick Armey (R-TX), ar-
gued that the minimum wage hurts
precisely the same low-skilled,
impoverished Americans that pro-
ponents said it would help by de-
stroying job opportunities that
would otherwise be available.
Armey and others argued that the
increased costs to business of the
increased minimum wage would
only be passed on to workers in
less benefits or less job openings.

Theeconomicconsensusonthis
point is pretty clear. Yet while few
economists would deny that rais-
ing the minimum wage costsjobs,
some will argue that the societal
benefits of increased wages would
outweigh the costs of lost jobs.

Many of you may remember
hearing in Econ 101 that if the
mandated minimum wage is higher
than the benefits a business would
reap from hiring another worker,
that business will refrain from hir-

ing. Absent that government man-
date, that business might be will-
ing to hire someone at a lower
wage. This is particularly true of
small business.

As I soon found out, W&L does
not rank as a stupid organization.
In September, every university
work-study student, including me,
got a letter telling them that the
university would now require that
upperclass students work no more
than eight hours a week, rather
than the previous ten.

“. . . you, the
person the in-
crease was
supposed to
help, lost
money.”

Doing the math on this change
tells you that this reduces your
potential weekly earnings from a
gross of $42.50 (10 x $4.25) to
$37.60 (8 x $4.70). By my count,
this amounts to a loss of $68.60 per
student over the 14 eligible work
weeks of fall term alone. Multiply
that by the 360 work study stu-
dents W&L employs, and the total
amount of money students will lose
during fall term alone reaches an
astounding $24,696.

Even when the next phase of the
minimum wage increase takes ef-

fect, each student will still be los-
ing $1.30 per week.

We’re not talking about insig-
niﬁcant amounts of money here,
especially to students who need
the financial aid a work-study job
provides. W&L actually made
money on the increase in the mini-
mum wage, while you, the person
the increase was supposed to help,
lost money.

This type of business action to
avoid the increased costs of the
raised minimum wage occurred
across the country. As Armey and
other warned, businesses won’t
stand still as government imposes
new mandates upon them; they

t

I.-

will quickly find a way to avoid thug:

new costs. (Although you can
credit W&L with going the extra
mile to find a way to make money
in the process.) Government ac-
tion does cause change in the
economy.

Now I do not want to sound
bitter, because I’m not. We are
lucky — most people working in
marginal minimum wage jobs for
businesses that can not afford the
increased costs just get fired or
lose the opportunity to be hired.
And it is usually not extra money
for them.

But the next time you hear a
liberal Democrat telling you hoe
government can intervene in the
economy, whether in the realm of
health care, the minimum wage, or
some other measure, and not cause
any problems, think about the ex-
tra course in economics W&L
work-study students are receiving
this fall.

The etare are back

(or those people who never should have tried film)

C.E. MILLER
Features Editor

Baby, they’re back. Those stars who made television worth
watching in my earlier less busy teenage years are back trying
to convince me that I have other nights besides Thursday to

watch television.

CBS hopes that Ted Danson (sans toupee) former co-star Rhea
Pearlmen (more gentle) and Bill Cosby (sorry no sweaters) can
help nudge NBC’s sweep of Neilson’s top ten. ABC is relying
on television veteran Michael J. Fox, and “Designing Woman”

Annie Potts to stiffen the competition.

The other three underdogs (UPN, WB, and FOX) rely on the
usual additions to spice up otherwise predictable programming
schedules. UPN’s “Homeboys in Outer Space” proves how low
some executives will go to get an audience. I mean what is that

about? i

NBC is still the master of sitcoms. Two additions stand out as
exceptional. First “Men Behaving Badly” is a must see (even
for this die hard Thursday nighter.) The first episode which
previewed onWednesday was exceptionally funny. The writing
in strong, and the jokes down to earth. Justine Bateman
(Family Ties) is a little bigger, and less into mall shopping and
relatively unimportant in this show. Ron Eldard, who spent
last season on the critically acclaimed “ER” and Rob Schnieder
perfectly portray what happened when Beavis and Butt-Head
grew up. The best line of the night had to be, “Some discussions

need beer.:”

NBC’s other sure fire hit, only because of its time slot, is
“Suddenly Susan.” If you like stupid people doing stupid

things that would never actually happen then maybe you’ll

love it. Personally I feel it resembles the other poor, poor NBC
sitcom “Third Rock From The Sun.” The humor in both seems
forced and trivial. However Brooke Shields squeezed in the
after “Seinfeld” slot should make big Neilson numbers.

It isn’t as if I really have time to waste adding new sitcoms to
my list of things to do instead of Russian homework, but this
season does offer some great reason to put off that memorization

a few more hours.

The best advice, be thankful we don’t get WB or UPN as part
of our cable package and just tune in for the reassuring
laughter of Thursday night television, besides new ER the

26th of this month what more can a girl ask for ?.

ALEXCHRISTENSEN
Phi Movns CRITIC

At the beginning of the summer, I
listed Jack in my review of Mission:

Impossible, as one of the summer films
I was really looking forward to. What

a disappointment, then, when I saw

the finished product. The beginning is

cool, with neat-o effects and plenty of

interesting business going on, but as

soon as Robin Williams comes into the.

film as Jack instead of the cute little

baby, it all falls down.

It seems irresistible, of course.

Stick Williams in the role of the little

kid who lives in a man’s body and just

stand back. And it is a wonderful idea.

In fact, it’s so wonderful that they've

already done it six times. First, they

called it Mark and Mindy, and then

they called it Hook, and then they

called it The Fisher King, and then

they called it Toys, then they called it
Mrs. Doubtﬁre, and then they called it
J umanji. And they were all pretty good.

So Jack is money in the bank, right?

Right! As far as box office re-

ceipts. But instead of saying anything

new or significant, or perhaps being

just light and entertaining and touch-
ing, director Francis Ford Coppola,

who admits he only directed the film
for the CAISI-1!, decided to make it a

___bi,g,,f_‘art j oke. Literally and metaphori-
. I.g;ally,...... . .

The ﬁlm is full of little Robin
Williams Moments , and some are
vaguely amusing, interrupted by short
bursts of earnest, concerned, idealistic
pap, which serves to try to dupe the
audience into believing something is
happening. Unfortunately, taken as a
whole, there’s just no “there” there.

The story: poor old Jack ages at
four times the normal rate. This is not
a real disease, which is made obvious
by the fact that the effects it has on
Jack’s life have not even a nodding
acquaintance with the circumstances
of real life. Jack is a bright, inquisitive
kid, and his tutor, played by Bill Cosby,
who can’t even get in a good movie
even if he waits for one directed by
Francis Coppola, recommends to his
parents, Diane Lane andBrian Kerwin,
that he be introduced to regular school
with other kids. Apparently in addi-
tion to keeping him out of school, his
parents have also kept him locked in
the attic or confined on a leash in the
backyard, because the neighborhood
kids all think he’s some kind of mon-
ster, even though he’s lived on their
street for ten years.

School is tough at first but ulti-
mately rewarding for J ack. The kids,
getting no explanation for why he’s six
feet tall and really old-looking, natu-
rally think, “He must have the coo-
ties.” They tease him or avoid him,
until one smart kid, Louie Durante,
played by Adam Zolotin with much
skill, figures out that he might be an
asset on the basketball court, and be-
friends him. Everyone else falls imme-
diately into line, cherishingJack’sjoie

Elephant Man meets Big!”

de vivre and ability to buy porn. They
go to a treehouse and fart in cans. Oh
sweet Lord, the hilarity.

Jack collapses with a heart
problem brought on by his disorder,
and his mother panics and takes him
out of school (?). But then when Jack
gets all depressed and grows a beard
and all the kids ride by on their skate-
boards and yell “Can Jack come out
and play?” over and over again, his
mom decides that to avoid all that
unpleasantness, she’ll let him go back
to school. You might be thinking, this
is a plot? Well, no, not in the technical
sense of the word, but everyone in the
film seems to think it is, so maybe
they’re right.

There are several weird threads
which interrupt this action, ultimately
leading nowhere. Louie’s mom, played

. .by..Fran. Drescher, hits on Jack when
he pretends to be the principal, and
this leads Jack to a bar later where he
gets in a fight and gets arrested. Also,
Jack gets a crush on his teacher (Jen-
nifer Lopez, absolutely magnificent)
and asks her to the school dance, prob-
ably the only sorta honest scene in the
film. Some of these subplots are surely
viable, but Jack can’t decide which
direction it wants to take. It wants to
depict the life of a kid growing up with
a disease that makes him an outsider,
in a humorous, warm-hearted way,
but it just doesn’t know how.

Williams’s performance is a
muddled mishmash of everything he’s
ever been in, but with farting. You
want to laugh when he’s onscreen, and
the physical sensation which results
from not being able to is actually pain-
ful.

As an interesting sidenote, you
may be interested to know that during
the opening and closing credits, Cana-
dian “rocker” Bryan Adams can be
distinctly heard singing the improb-
able lines, ‘‘There’ll be times/You’ll be
dancing and s—t.” Four—letter words
long ago invaded PG films, but per-
haps we can draw the line at cheap
bubble-gum pop.

To recap, this film was directed
by Francis Ford Coppola, the same
Francis Ford Coppola who directed
the Godfather ﬁlms, Apocalypse Now,
The Outsiders, Peggy Sue Got Mar-
ried, Tucker: The Man and His Dream,
Bram Stoker’s Dracula, and other great
or passable films. If I didn’t tell you
now, you might not be able to figure it
out from the film.

W&L soccer squads kick competition

By Soon‘ BOOKWALTER Men’s Soccer Women’s Soccer
PHI SPORTS EDITOR

The women’s soccer team has
enjoyed similar success, taking its
first two contests in extremely differ-
ent fashions.

The Generals opened their season
with a nailbiting 3-2 victory over
Virginia Wesleyan last Saturday be-
fore returning home to maul Hollins,
6-0, on Wednesday.

W&L figured to be in for a tough
battle Saturday in Norfolk and Vir-
ginia Wesleyan didn’t disappoint.
Wesleyan led 2-1 with only about
three minutes remaining in regulans ’
tion, but sophomore Erica Reineke came to the rescue for
W&L as she netted a goal to force overtime.

The first overtime came and went with the teams still
deadlocked at two goals apiece. The score remained the
same throughout most of the second overtime until Mich-
elle Bauman took matters into her own hands.

With only thirty seconds remaining in the second over-
time, the senior tri-captain kicked home the dramatic
game-winner, sending the Generals home weary, but 3-2
victors nevertheless. ,

Sophomore Nicole Johnson scored the other W&L goal ‘
in the Virginia Wesleyan contest and also assisted on
another score. I

Senior Beth Mozena and freshman Stephanie McKnight
teamed up to frustrate Virginia Wesleyan, warding off 16
of 18 shots during the contest.

The Generals weren’t in the mood for another tight
contest Wednesday as they stormed out onto the Liberty h
Hall Fields and obliterated Hollins, 6-0. ‘ l

Sophomore Karin Treese had an incredible day for the
Generals. She tied a school record with nine points as she '
scored four times and assisted on another goal, giving the ‘

The men jumped out to a 2-0 start thanks to a pair
of 2-1 wins last week on the Liberty Hall Fields. The
Generals edged Shenandoah, 2-1, on Thursday the
12th, in a fight-marred contest. W&L then knocked
off Catholic by an identical count last Saturday
afternoon.

Freshman Jamie Parker basked in the limelight
for the Generals against Shenandoah as
he scored both W&L goals. Parker
snapped a 1-1 tie with under four min-
utes remaining as he kicked home the
eventual game-winning goal.

Soon after, the emotion from more
than 88 minutes of hard-fought play
came to a boil as a fight erupted follow- .
ing a W&L foul.

Tempers ﬂared between the teams,
leading to an ugly melee in which a
W&L fan joined the brawl. Officials
were finally able to intervene and the
game finished up with the Generals
prevailing by the 2-1 count.

Things were less tense but still just
as exciting two days later when W&L
locked up with Catholic on the Liberty
Hall Fields.

Sophomore Sam Chase took his turn
as the one-man show as he tallied both
Generals goals. Both scores came in
the second halfas W&L held offCatho-
lie for its second straight 2-1 win.

Chase leads the Generals with 5
points after the two games,
complimenting his two goals with one
assist.

The W&L soccer squads have tasted nothing but
victory thus far this year.

After four combined games this year, the men’s and
women’s teams have triumphed in each one, many in

Save the males?

VMI move to privatize flounders

BY ANNE ALVORD
PHI EXECUTIVE EDITOR

On Saturday, September 21, to a
crowded room of reporters, alumni and
other interested parties, Virginia Mili-
tary Institute announced the decision of
its Board of Visitors to admit women.
The decision was made in light of the
Supreme Court’s June 26 decision that
the institute must admit women or give
up state funding.

The Supreme Court decision ended a
six year battle that began when the Jus-
tice Department sued in 1990 over the
school’s all-male policy.

The decision of the Board of Visitors
came despite strident opposition from
alumni, which was expressed as late as
Friday evening at a public hearing. Those

" opposed to co-education advocated

privatizationasameansto keeptheschool
all male. In the end this solution was
rejected because of legal and financial
considerations. To privatize the school
would have had to raise $200 million to
make up for the loss of state funding, and
would also likely have had to purchase
the grounds of the institute, which would
have cost an additional $137 million.
The final vote on the issue was 9-8 in
favor of co-education, and was arrived at
when the board reached a deadlock at 8-
8 and Chair William W. Berry, President

I‘

of the Board of Visitors and a 1954
graduate of VMI, had to break the tie.

The vote resulted in five members of
the opposition makes a rebuttal to the
majority decision. In a prepared state-
ment which represented this minority
view, Anita Blair stated that “The major-
ity has chosen a course that makes poor
use of Virginia’s educational resources.
TheﬁnancialcostofmodifyingVMl’sphysi-
cal plant is vastly disproportionate to the
beneﬁtofeducatingatiny numberofwomen
who might be interested in attending VMl.”

Changing to a co—ed institution will
cost approximately $5.7 million. This
includes the physical changes required to
preserve ‘physical dignity’ and for the
hiring of additional staff. VMI will ask
the state to fund these changes.

The physical changes needed will in-
clude half shades on barracks windows,

A which will be used only when the cadets

are changing and will be open at all other
times and the addition of women’s show-
ers. Additionally, therewill be rules against
cadets dating outside their own classes.
The school will not treat women dif-
ferently than men. Superintendent Josiah
Bunting III expressed his view that “fully
qualified women would themselves feel
demeaned by any relaxation in the stan-
dards the VM I system imposes on young
men.” Women will live in barracks with
all other cadets and locks will not be

installed on the doors. Female rats will
receive buzz cuts, as do their male coun-
terparts and they will be required to meet
the same academic and physical require-
ments as men. The physical requirements
include five pull ups, sixty sit-ups in two
minutes and a two-and-a-half-mile run in
twelve minutes. As underthe current system,
those who do not meet the physical require-
ments will not fail out of school, but will
receive special assistance in meeting them.

Requiring men and women to meet
the same standards will distinguish VMI
from The Citadel and the military acad-
emies, where the standards are different.
When asked if he thought having the
same standards was what Supreme Court
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, who wrote
the majority decision on the case, in-
tended when she said that the VMI sys-
tem is not inherently impossible for
women, Bunting said that they are “tak-
ing her at her word.”

VMI has not yet made any specific
plan for co-education. They will create a
plan in the coming months which will
have to be submitted to the federal justice
in Roanoke. One question remaining to
be answered is how to deal with sexual
harassment, but as Bunting said, it’s too
early to say what they will do.

After the press conference,
Firstclassman Brian Bagwan, Regimen-
tal Comander, felt confident that there

would be little negative reaction from the
corps. “Some will be more disappointed
than others, but I don’t expect anything se-
vere. We won’t be picketing out in front of
barracks,” he said, “this isn’t Berkley.”

He is certain the corp will push
through. “It’s a question of wait and
see,” he said, adding, “At least now we
know where we’re going. When asked if
he was surprised by the decision, he
replied, ‘‘It wasn’t inconceivable, but I
wouln’t say I expected it. As you can see
by the vote, no one knew what was going
to happen.”

Since the announcement, approxi-
mately 80 applications have been sent
out to women interested in joining next
year’s entering class. VMI is hoping to
have between 8 and 15 percent women in
their next class. Admissions will be gen-
der blind.

One positive result of the decision is
the donation of a $10 million scholarship
by an anonymous alumnus. The scholar-
ship will be named in honor of General
George C. Marshall and will be awarded
to male or female students. When asked
whether he thought alumni contribu-
tions, which currently make up about one
third of VMI’s operating funds, would be
negatively affected by co-education,
Bunting pointed to this donation as an
indication that donations will not change
or will even increase.

For hundreds of W&L and VMI students The
Chessie Trail is a relaxing place for afternoon runs;
however, one female W&L student encountered a
shocking surprise last week.

“Even though I wasn’t physically harmed,” said
the victim, “itwas very upsetting to see something so
disturbing on a well-used trail.”

The student was jogging alone on The Chessie
Trail, the foot path behind Woods Creek Apartments
which runs by the VMI tennis courts, when she
noticed a white male in his 20’s sitting on an em-
bankment. As she passed him, he placed his hands
on his crotch and asked her if she wanted to watch.
The student ignored him and ran to the W&L secu-
rity office.

The student was only able to provide a vague
description of the subject: a white male, light brown
or dark blond hair, 5 foot 6 inches to 5 foot 8 inches

 

tall, wearing a tee shirt, blue ‘athletic shorts and a
white baseball cap.

The security office immediately notified the Lex-
ington Police about the harrassment and they are
currently running down leads.

According to Chief Michael Young, head of
W&L security, similar incidents have occurred in
the past. “Try to run with a friend,” encouraged
Young. “Normally these encounters occur when a
student is alone and the offender wants to provoke a
reaction. There may be no intent to cause injury, but
we don’t want to run any risks. We are taking this
very seriously.”

Young reminds students to be aware of any strang-
ers that they may encounter on any area of the
campus. “Anyone who sees suspicious activity
needs to call us immediately.”

Alpha Phi Omega, the co-ed ser-
.vice fraternity, initiated the first
pledge class of the Washington
and Lee 1996-1997 school year
last night. The pledge class of 18
included freshmen and sopho-
mores, and was the largest of Al-
pha Beta Tau’s 10 year history.
APO is the only greek organiza-
tion the universtiy allows to rush
and intitiate pledges in the fall
term. All other greek organiza-
tions must hold rush and
pledgeship duringthe winter term.
APO took this oppprtunity to at-
tract a larger pledgeclass than was
possible whilethe fraternites were

also holding their rush. The
pledge ceremony capped off a
week of rush activities. '

A trip to Goshen on Saturday Sep-
tember 21st began the week with
APO brothers and rushees meet-
ing one another for the first time.
The location served as back-
ground to meet new friends and
discuss the questions potential
pedges raised. Everyone met
again on Sunday at 1:00 p.m. in
front ofthe Baker-Davis-Gilliam,
Quad to climb into cars and head
to the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals.

their favorite rush activity. Fresh-

Juniors meet the players
in the W&L network

PHI EXECUTIVE EDITOR

ver 130 members of the

junior class filed into the

Great Hall of the science

center last night to learn the finer

points of internships. Those who at-

tended heard accounts of past interns

positions from about 30 students,

mostly seniors, learned about the pro-

cess of finding and applying for in-

ternships and met with alumni intern-
ship sponsored.

The attendance was astounding to
the sponsors, the Career Development
and Placement Office, the Alumni
Office and the Management Depart-
ment, who expected they would draw
about 50 to 75 students.

This was the first year that such an
event was held and the sponsors hope
to make it an annual event. During the
opening remarks, Hatton Smith, ’73,
president of the Alumni Board, dis-
cussed how to network and the value
of the Washington and Lee network.
“The W&L'network is astounding,”
he said,“ Where did the CEO of Time
go? How about the CEO of Southern

Living? Does anyone use Mennen .

aftershave? Guess where Jeff Mennen
went to school.” Further, he asked,
“Do you know what school has more
CEOs per capita than any other school
in the country?”

alumni and students who had intem-
ships last summer. In one group,
Peter Sheppard, ’72, President of R.H.
Sheppard&Co., Inc. talked about what
his company strives to offer interns.
He strives for his interns to ‘actually
do something’, and not have them be
ofﬁce gophers. Students answered
questions about finding internships,
relocating and the work they did in
their internships.

After the break-off meetings the
entire group reconvened in the Great
Hall for a reception, at which those
who attended the session were en-
couraged to try out their networking
skills.

Internships provide students with
work experience in their ﬁelds and
make them more attractive to pos-
sible employers when they enter the
job market.

For further assistance in ﬁnding
internships, students should attend one
of the internship workshops offered
by the CDPO, which are targeted to
particular interest areas, liberal arts/
fine arts, C-school, sciences and com-
munications.

The CDPO has resources that pro-
vide information about a variety of
internships and the alumni sponsored
internship program. Internships can
be found in fields from theater to
business and government to the sci-
ences.

Portrait of an American woman

Dan Odenwald
Features Editor

Isabel Connor is standing in front of
the Laundromat’s washer pulling out
her wet clothes. She folds them neatly
and puts them into her basket.

“I never use the dryers,” says the 83-
year-old Lexington resident. “I hang
them on the line. I’ve always done it
thatway. Ilike the smell of the airin my
clothes.”

Her hands are covered with purple
age spots. She’ll tell you she’s going
deaf in her right ear, but most people
know she’s really going deaf in both.
But if you talk clearly enough, she can
understand you. And Isabel loves to
talk. Boy, does she love to talk...

“VMI is a man’s school - it always
has been,” she says deﬁantly. ‘‘I don’t
know much about this women’s move-
ment, but it’s just a man’s school.”

Born in Rockbridge County in 1913,
she’s the second oldest daughter of ten
children — seven girls and three boys.
Her mother owned a farm and when
Isabel wasn’t in school she was helping
out with the chores. Milking the cows
was her favorite. In those days, physi-
cal labor wasn’t something just reserved
for work. Indeed, Isabel remembers
walking eight miles to school every-
day.

“Back in those days we didn’t have
school buses,” she remarks. “We didn’t
have computers, a television or even a
McDonalds.’’

The uniform for female students was
strict: long dresses, stockings, and boots.
Only her face and hands were allowed
to be naked.

When Isabel completed school, she
went to work at the naval base in
Quantico, Virginia. - She worked in the
ofﬁcer’s club, which she loved. Her
mother would send her cured hams, a
gentle remedy for a homesick farm-
girl. Isabel appreciated her mother’s
kindness, but she wouldn’t eat them.
Instead, she used the hams to make
sandwiches and “gave them to the boys.”

“The boys were from all over the
States,” remembers Isabel. “Some
didn’t even know what a cured ham
was.”

In 1941, Isabel left Quantico for
Aberdeen, Maryland where she worked

You’ve come a long way baby!

Many young women are choosing body
piercing and tattoos as an intimate form of self-
expression. Even at Washington and Lee, ha-
ven of conservative values and ideas, women
are pierced, and many possess intimate tattoos.

According to Eddie, a Roanoke tattoo artist
at Ancient Art, many of his clients are young
women, 18-25 years in age. The stigma of
having a pierced nose or body art has all but
disappeared.

Junior Megan Johnson had her navel pierced
her senior year in high school.

“It took about six months to convince my
parents that (piercing) wasn’t going to kill me
or permanently scar,” said Johnson.

Since she was 17 at the time, the shop she
visited required parental permission. Although,
Virginia doesn’t require parental permission,
any reputable shop will request permission
before piercing or tattooing.

Sunda Wells, a junior, has an ankle tattoo.
She also had to get parental permission.

“When I got my tattoo, I was the only one in
my group of friends. It was a way for me to be
unique, sort of an expression of my personal-
ity.”
Eddie feels that women tattoo for more
personal reasons that men.

“A woman will come in and want it in a more
sexual place. Men, generally come in groups
and tattoo someplace that can be easily shown
of ,” said Eddie. '

Wells feels that many people are copying a
lot of celebrities in getting tattoos. Drew
Barrymore has a prominent tattoo above her
belly-button, and Pamela Anderson has sev-
eral, one of which is her husband’s name around
her finger.

“I think that if I ever got a second tattoo, it
would be of a more personal nature. It can be a
true expression of yourself, and it is a lifetime

commitment,” said Well_s. _
Johnson has never seriously considered get-

ting pierced in another place.

“I don’t want to pierce anything on my face.
It is also just seems really painful, and I am kind
of a wimp,” said Johnson.

There are no classes one can take to learn
how to pierce or tattoo. According to Eddie, it
is an apprenticeship. Talented artists, don’t
necessarily do well as tattoos. He also feels that
many shops ignore the health aspects of pierc-

 
 
    

ing. Ancient Art Tattoo has been in Roanoke
for 25 years. They pride themselves on a
safety-conscious personnel and educating the
public about tattoos and piercing.

“I feel like 10 years ago there was all this
mystery surrounding tattoos and piercing. I
want to clear up things for people. You need to
know what you are getting into and how to
protect yourself against health hazards,” said
Eddie.

Many states, such as New York, have made
tattooing illegal. One reason for this was the
scare that it would spread diseases such as
hepatitis B. - ‘ ‘

Before you jump on the tattoo and piercing P‘

bandwagon, check out the establishment thor-
oughly. Many cheaper artists are available, but
that usually means the person is not well-trained.

“Don’t skimp a few bucks on something that
will last you a lifetime,” said Eddie. '

entertainers. But, whatever you do, don’t call
them cheerleaders. Rather than leading cheers,
the R.E.Belles will be receiving them.

“We are not cheerleaders,” Cheryl Puzon,
president of Washington and Lee’s new dance
team, said. “We are there to entertain and
support the Generals.” I

The R.E.Belles are recruiting students in-
terested in performing highly-stylized dance
routinesduring men’s home basketball games.

The dance team will hold its first of three
clinics 1:30 p.m. Saturday on the third ﬂoor
of DuPont Hall. The first clinic will focus on
skills, while the later clinics, to be held in
October and November, will team members_
the dances for performances.

The team’s clinics are open to everyone,
regardlessof experience. Vice President Kathy
Dusse said team members will work with
those who are interested in performing the
jazz, funk and drill routines.

The R.E.Belles will debut December 4,
when the men’s basketball team plays
Hampden-Sydney college. They are slated to
perfonn at four other home games and are
scheduling other perfomtances which may
include the Virginia Military Institute/Wash-
ington and Lee Basketball Classic, a women’s
basketball game and the Lexington Christ-
mas parade.

Last year, an attempt was made at forming
the dance team, but the group next got started
due to scheduling conﬂicts, Puzon said. W&L
Dance,which emphasizes artistic danceform,
began last year. Puzon said when she visited
campus as a prospective student she attended
a basketball game and saw there were no
performance outlets for dancers. As a former
drill team captain, she still wanted to per-
form and found others with that desire. She
said the team’s purpose other than entertain-
ing at basketball games and supporting the
Generals is to provide dancers with perfor-
mance opportunities.

at a naval base. She was there on the
day when the Japanese bombed Pear
Harbor.

“It was a terrible day. It made your
stomach turn over,” she recalls.

During the war, Isabel worked in
the civilian corps on the naval base.
Among her duties were repairing war-
ravaged airplanes and stuffing para-
chute packs.

To lighten spirits, she and herfriends
used to play jokes on the G.l.s. Some-
times she included a note in the para-
chute packs which read: If this doesn’t
open, just come back and get a new
one. The prank still makes her chuckle
ﬁfty-ﬁve years later.

Isabel became quite skilled at re-
pairing plane engines. In fact, she
learned it so well that she became one
of the best. Isabel also learned how to
ﬂy, but her bosses wouldn’t let her
“because she was a civilian.” Although
her secret talent may have surprised
some, Isabel never thought of herself
as particularly special.

“I always just went ahead and did
it,” she said. “I neverthought I couldn’t
do it. After all, it’s not hard to do if you
like it.” —

Afterthe war, Isabel returned home.
She married in 1952. Although she
never had kids (“God didn’t intend it”),
Isabel quit work and took care of her
husband. She never liked housework,
but she knew she would never return to
the days of repairing warplanes.

later, Isabel took on some light
work at VMI’s tailor shop. During her
tenure, she was able to see two neph-
ews graduate from the corps. Most of
her memories of VMI are fond, but she
does remember feeling sorry for the
rats.

“Those boys would just get up in
their faces — a couple of inches away
from their noses —-— and just yell at
them all day long,” Isabel says. “I
wanted to go overto them and pull their
hats down around their ears.

Like most of Lexington, Isabel was
shocked to hear the Supreme Court
ruling that VMI must admit women.
According to Isabel, Virginia’s already
got enough women’s schools.

“Women are all right,” she argues.
“It’sjust that it’s always been a man’s
school.” ‘

Furthermore, she believes that

women will interfere with the school’s

tradition.

‘‘I don’t think they’ll make it,” she
says. “Ladies just aren’t ladies any-
more. I mean, how will you be ableto
tell a woman apart from a man?”

Isabel admits that she’s old and set
in her ways. So, it was especially hard
on her when her husband of 41 years
passed away three years ago.

Nevertheless, she continues to plug
on. She gets tired easily these days, but
that doesn’t stop her from going to the
Presbyterian church every Sunday.
Today, she’s going to drop off some
children’s books at the library. She
found them neara dumpsterin Fairfield
and cleaned them up for others to use.

Isabel’s got a lot to do. As she

prepares to leave the Laundromat, she
puts her (still wet) clothes in the back of her
1968 Chevette. She’s had the car for 28
years and even though automobile collec-
tors keep oﬁering to buy it from her, she
likes it and has no plans of selling it.
“One man from Salem offered to

buy my hubcaps,” she recalls. “I asked -

him, ‘What do you think my car will

...-.-...-«nu

look like without hubcaps?”’ _

Isabel gently climbs into the drivers
seat and eases the giant car out into the_
parking lot. As the red brake lights
ﬁnally dim, the car makes its way out
onto the road. 1

Inside, Isabel begins to plan the rest;
of her day —— an ordinary day in the
ordinary life of an American lady. T

 More women
  finally coming

‘to Big Lex

i

GreenLand
Betsy Green ’97

, for Star Wars references.

Unless you’ve been living un-
der a rock (and let’s face it, Lex-
ington is pretty damned close), you
are aware that the Supreme Court
has ruled that our next door neigh-
bor, Virginia Military Institute,
must admit women. And VMI’s
board of directors just voted to
admit women, rather than making
VMI a private school. If you think
that we’re anywhere near done talk-
ing about VMI coeducation, you’ve
got another thing coming to you.

So far I’ve seen some reactions
to the decision that have left me
less than impressed. I saw a tea-
shirt at University Sportswear that
depicted a bald woman in a yellow
and red VMI running costume
weeping. Clever, but considering
the number of male rats that drop
out in the first week, it could have

“And will

  W&L women

call these
women road
cheese also?”

well been a weeping bald male.

There are bumper stickers all
over town. One I saw said, “Im-
peach Darth Bader,” referring to
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsberg, who wrote the majority
opinion for the case. I will admit,
it is kind of funny . . . I’m a sucker
But
shouldn’t a good soldier respect
the laws of their country? Just a
thought.

My favorite bumper sticker,
though, is the one that says, “Any
woman who wants the VMI expe-
rience should marry a VMI man.”
Imagine with me what that could
mean. V

Sarah Rat marries Stonewall
Keydet. Immediately after they
exchange vows, Sarah is forced to
shave her head and run ten miles in
her regulation dress white wed-

ding gown. For the first year,
Stonewall forces Sarah to keep a
rigorous regiment of exercise and
marching. . . sounds great doesn’t
it?

Anyway, in November of her
third year of marriage, Sarah fi-
nally gets her ring (rather back-
wards, but hey—it’s VMI). As
per tradition, Sarah and the other
wives rent hotel rooms that week-
end and get ragingly drunk. Stone-
wall and his buddies go to their
ring dance wearing big, white,
fluffy dresses.

Back to reality, though. I think
anyone who is still protesting
VMl’s coeducation needs to get
over it. If you still have those
stickers on your car and that poster
on your wall, basically you are
emphasizing one glaring fact
about VMI: YOU LOST! VMI
needs to quit complaining, admit
women, and treat them as badly as
they treat everyone else. VMI
should be proud of anyone who
can survive rathood, male or fe-
male.

My main concern will be how
VMI’s coeducation will affect
Washington and Lee students.
Will it be considered cool for
W&L men to date female cadets?
And will W&L women call these
women road cheese also? Sure,
there’s a road between us, but it’s
not quite the same. By the way,
I’m trying desperately to come up
with a rat/cheese pun, and it’s not
working for me. Feel free to make
up your own.

A greater inﬂux of women
might make an impact on Lexing-
ton. Maybe The Palms will have
“girl drinks” like wine coolers
and Zima on tap and Melrose will
replace Monday Night Football
on the TVs. More women can
only help us as far as Lexington
shopping is concerned. There are,
what, three billion places in town
where you can buy Duckheads
and navy blue blazers? Perhaps
VMI women will bring with them
a Victoria’s Secret.

There truly are some shocking
changes going on here in Big Lex.
When W&L and VMI were both
all male, this was testosterone city.
Now VMI is coed, and W&L’s
lopsided male-female ration is
slipping. Yikes! If I weren’t
already engaged, I’d have to con-
sider transferring.

Decision ’96: Dole VS. Clinton
Issue #1 : School Choice

That day is almost upon us. Yes,
W&L, the election is coming up
very soon--only37days left! Mark
your calendars for November 5th,
the day when the “first president of
the 21 st century” will be elected.

Time to call in for that absentee
ballot that never seems to get to
you on time, and decide which
person you want to lead our great
nation. Will it be President Clinton
again, Bob Dole, Ross Perot? Or
will this be Ralph Nader’s year?

In these final 6 weeks, The Ring-
tum Phi is going to bring you two
columns from opposite sides of the
political spectrum on different is-
sues. On the right this week is
Joshua Heslinga, ’98, our retiring
conservative columnist. On the
left will be Laura Knapp, ’97, our
new Democratic columnist.

For the many of you on this
campus that are dead-set in your

political affiliation, may the best

man win. For those of you who are
trying desperately to decide which
side is the lesser of two evils, hope-
fully this will make your decision
a little easier.

Ends & Means
Joshua Heslinga ’98

As I pen my last column, I
thought it should focus the debate
this week on the issue that most
directly involves the future of
America: education. It is an issue
that Bill Clinton loves to use to
blast Republicans, yet it is pre-
cisely this issue that illustrates the
stale ideas of liberalism.

The most important proposal
conservatives advance for,educa-
tion is school choice, which means
giving parents government vouch-
ers, which they then delivertowhat-
ever school, public or private, they
want their child to go to, instead of
pouring their tax money into pub-
lic schools. For once, opportunity
would be equal for all.

This does not mean abandoning
the public.scho0ls. Good public
schools will win acceptance, and
children trapped in bad public
schools will be free to go to a
school that succeeds.

The states of Wisconsin and
Ohio are now running test voucher
programs in the inner cities of Mil-

waukee and Cleveland, and early
studies show marked improvement
in student performance. These
states have seen alliances between
their Republican governors and a
few Democratic legislators to ex-
pand educational opportunity.

Yet when the Republican Con-
gress wanted to run a similar test
program in Washington, D.C., Bill
Clinton vetoed it, believing that
poor parents trapped in D.C.’s
abysmal public school system did
not deserve the same opportunity
to send their children elsewhere as
he has exercised with Chelsea.

School choice is popular. Polls
consistently show school choice
winning support from two-thirds
or more of the American public,
with support highest among black,
inner—city families.

School choice is fair. It would
empower parents to make a real
difference in their child’s educa-
tion by sending him or her to a
school where crime is under con-
trol, standards are maintained, and
the best academic curriculum is
available.

School choice is economical.
In New York City, private schools
typically cost $2000-$3000 per stu-

dent, per year, which they use to
consistently deliver better aca-
demic performance, graduation
rates, and disciplinary records than
public schools using 3 times as
much tax money per child.

And finally, school choice is
constitutional. Opponents’ main
argument has been that implement-
ing vouchers “violates the separa-
tion of church and state.” Appar-
ently, they believe that somehow,
society is the great loser when par-
ents have the freedom to find the
best education for their child.
Rather, school choice exemplified
the First Amendment’s guarantee
of the right to freely exercise one’s
own religion. No ones’ child would
be compelled to go to a religious
school.

While the fate of school choice
will eventually be decided on a
state-by-state basis, Bob Dole has
proposed a national program to
empower the poorest and most at-
risk students through a voucher
program. If our country wants to
rediscover the greatness in Ameri-
can education, it will begin with
the enactment of school choice

Wrong Medicine for ailing %g,g,,,Ca,,-0,, System

From the Left
V Laura Knapp ’99

With almost half of Washington
and Lee students having graduated
from private or parochial high
schools, I have a fairly difficult
task of proving that school vouch-
ers would have an adverse effect on
schoolchildren as well as Ameri-
can society on a whole.

If one were to ask most private/
parochial high school graduates if
the quality of their education was
second to none, the likely answer is
that indeed it was.

With the very best of facilities,
teachers, materials, and students
themselves, there is little room for
failure. Graduates of these schools
probably go on to four-year col-
leges and then to comfortablejobs.

This is definitely a good result. It
would appear logical to allow for

further enrollment in such success-

ful schools by instituting the
voucher system.

But the voucher system that has
been proposed presents serious
implications to out present system
of public education. In a nation
that is already split along racial,
ethnic, economic, and religious
lines, public education is the only
real common denominator in the

majority of American back-
grounds. VVith private education,
communities do not have a say in
what is being taught.
James Carville said it best in
We ’re Right, They’re Wrong,
“Wondering about the curriculum
at the David Koresh Academy?
How about the expulsion policy at
the Louis Farrakhan School? Well,
stopwondering. It ain’t none of
your business now,and it will never
get to be your business, even if
they used your tax dollars to send
somebody to these schools.”

“It does in-
deed take a
village to
raise a

child”

No matter what Bob Dole or
any other Republican says, it does
indeed take a village to raise a
child. As a democracy, we have a
duty to educate our future leaders
as the community sees fit.

To deprive funding to public
schools by allowing vouchers
would only make problems worse

for the public schools. Facilities,
teachers and materials are already
severely lacking. Imagine deathly
sick public schools in need of medi-
cal help. The doctor prescribes
medicine, which for our purposes,
represents funding.. What the
voucher plan proposes is to stop all
medicine and let the patient die.
As shocking as this may be, it is
very close to the truth. The stu-
dents that are not smart enough,
rich-enough or for whatever rea-
son will not be able to win admis-
sion to the selective private schools

and thus will have nowhere else to _

go other than back to the proposed
under-funded and under—staffed
public schools. What does this say
to the child? At such an early age
to be faced with such rejection, the
child’s development into a pro-
ductive member of'society would
be stunted.
Liberals and conservatives agree
on few issues. But a common goal
among all Americans, liberal and
conservative alike, is a resolve to
improve American schools. Most
apparently though, is that school
vouchers are not the answer. In-
stead of cutting Head Start pro-
grams and college loan programs
like the Republicans are in Con-
gress now, the US needs an ex-
panded role, rather than restricted,
in the future of our nation.

time to coach and help get the team started. Penny works
at the farm of Amy Reistrup in Collierstown, who has
experience riding and coaching with the intercollegiate
riding teams at UVA and Southern Virginia College.
Reistrup has also agreed to volunteer her time in order to
insure W&L’s successful beginning.

Members ofthe riding team will take lessons two times
a week from Sarah Irvine, using horses at her stables in
Raphine. Expenses for members ofthe ridingteam are $20
per lessons plus traveling costs. W&L’s riding team will
compete in the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association
(IHSA). The Executive Committee gave the team $1000
which will cover membership fees to IHSA and help deter
the costs of entry fees.

Nichols hopes that in its first year, the riding team will
be able to overcome the expense of lessons and member-
ship and the team’s lack of funds. ’

‘‘I want to show other students and the administration
that we’re going to be good,” she said.

IHSA is comprised of 13 other schools, two of which
are Hollins College in Roanoke and Southern Virginia
College in Buena Vista. Penny and Starer hope the team
will be ready to compete October 6 at Virginia Tech in
Blacksburg. ‘

‘‘I think it will be a wonderful for W&L students to ride
against big schools like Virginia Tech and Duke,” said
Starer.

in which all IHSA members can compete. The host school
provides the horses. The biggest challenge and difference
in an IHSA competition compared to normal horse shows
is that riders do not know or get to practice on their horse
prior to competition.

“You have to go in cold turkey and ﬁgure out the horse
in a matter of seconds,” explains Penny. “This makes you
go back to basics and show everything you’ve learned in
front of the judges.”

“This is a different competition than what many of us
are used to,” said Rector. She stressed the importance of
the team needing beginning-level riders. Because this is a
team effort, the points for the beginner count equally to the
points for the advanced rider. ‘

Penny remembers many instances in her intercollegiate
career when the fate of the team would end up on the
shoulders of the last rider of the day, who would be a
beginner showing for the first time. The pressure, stress
and excitement of the situation would really pull the team
together, she said.

“As many people came out for the riding team as they
do for a sport like tennis,” said Nichols. “lt’s only fair that
W&L gives some attention to all the athletes here who can
really give something back to the school.’’

Soccer teams celebrate anniversary with victories

BY Scorr BOOKWALTER
PHI SPORTS EDITOR

The best players in W&L
soccer history were honored last
weekend in Lexington, but as
fans and
f o r m e r
p l a y e r s
a l i k e
could see,
thecurrent
Generals
may soon
beranking
with the
best of the
past. ‘
T h e
W&Lsoccer teams won all three
of their games last weekend,
making the 50th anniversary of
W&L soccer a triumphant one.

Unlike their male counter-

 

parts, the women’s soccer team
had to play two games this week-
end. It turned out to be no prob-
lem, although neither win came
easy.

The Generals locked up in a
low-scoring battle with
Maryville in the second game of
a W&Lsoccer doubleheader late
Saturday afternoon. After the
two teams dueled to a scoreless
tie at halftime, W&L broke out
on top early in the second half.
Sophomore Karin Treese scored
her sixth goal of the season on a
corner kick at the 48:40 mark,
boosting the Generals into the
lead at 1-0.

Treese’s goal ended up being
the final margin as the Generals
played inspired defense in the
second half, turning away every
Maryville scoring opportunity.
Senior Beth Mozena and fresh-
man Stephanie McKnight com-

bined on the shutout forthe Gen-
erals. McKnight fended off six
shotswhile Mozena turned away
one.

There was a little more ex-
citement and a lot more scoring
on Sunday afternoon when
Greensboro paid a visit to the
Liberty Hall Fields to conclude
the anniversary weekend. The
Generals made sure it remained
a festive one as they outlasted
Greensboro, 6-3, in double over-
time.

The first half ended in a 1-1
tie as sophomore Nicole
Johnson’s goal at 26:51 was an-
swered by a Greensboro goal
late in the half.

The teams began to light up
the scoreboard in the second half,
however. Senior Jenni Grant’s
score two minutes into the sec-
ond half lifted W&L into a brief
2-1 advantage. But Greensboro
reeled off two goals in the next
ﬁve minutes to vault into a 3-2
lead.

It remained that way until
Johnson struck again. The
sophomore knocked home her
third goal of the year and second
of the day at the 78:58 mark to
tie it up at 3 apiece.

The defenses tightened as
regulation ended with the score
tied. The score remained locked
through the first overtime. But
W&L was in no mood to drag
out the contest any longer and
blew away Greensboro in the
second overtime with a three-
goal ﬂurry.

Treese started the second
overtime by nettingthe eventual
game—w’inning goal off an assist
from freshman Deirdre Coyle.

Sophomore Caroline Keen gave
W&L some breathing room at
5-3 by putting away a rebound
off the post. Seven minuteslater,
Grant inscribed the exclamation
point on the Generals’ amazing
overtime run by booting home
her second goal of the afternoon
to provide the final margin.

Mozena and McKnight were
once again solid in the cage.
McKnight warded off six shots
while Mozena saved three.

The women, now 5-0 and
ranked 8th in the South Region,
attempted to protect their un-
beaten streak on the road Thurs-
day against Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College. ‘ ’ ~

The Generals came away
winners again, 1-0, as sopho-
more Lorraine Taurassi scored
the only goal of the contest with
8:11 remaining.

Mozena and McKnight com-
bined for the shutout, their third
in the last four games.

The victory moved the Gen-
erals’ record to 5-0. The Gener-
als will next be in action Satur-
day against Guilford at home.

The men’s team entertained
the socceralumnibytoyingwith
visiting Lynchburgformorethan
one half Saturday before putting
the game away late, 5-1. In the
process, it raised its record to 3-
0, 1-0 in the ODAC.

Freshman Jamie Parker had
an unbelievable day forthe Gen-
erals. He wowed the home
crowd by providing W&L with
nearly its entire offense with his
four-goal barrage.

As was the custom with the

»-Generals’ soccer teams last

weekend, the men ﬁnished the

first half in a tie., Lynchburg
struck first twelve minutes into
the game but Parker answered

~midway through the half with

his first goal of the day, knotting
the score at one goal apiece. ‘

Senior tri-captain Colin
Connolly made sure it didn’t
remain that way for long. He
netted the eventual game-win-
ner three minutes into the sec-
ond half to give the Generals a 2-
1 advantage.

With the score still 2-1 mid- '

way through the half, Parker took
control. Hlbegan his personal
second half onslaught by blast-
ing home his second goal to pro-
vide the Generals with a 3-1
edge. With ten minutes remain-
ing in regulation, Parker made
sure Lynchburg didn’t mount a
comeback by scoring yet an-
other goal to give W&L a com-
fortable 4-1 margin.

Parker wasn’t through with
the Hornets yet. With Lynchburg
reeling, down three goals with
six minutes remaining, the last
thingthe Hornets’ goalie wanted
to see was Parker heading to-
ward him once again. That is
exactly what happened as Parker
drove home the final nail in the
Lynchburg coffin with his fourth
and final goal of the game. With
his huge afternoon, Parker leads
the squad with six goals on the
season.

Junior Gordon Meeker con-
tributed in a key way for the
Generals by assisting on two
goals. Senior Mike Matechak
and sophomores Sam Chase and
Mikel Parker all had one assist
apiece

saves in the cage for the Gener-
als.

On Wednesday, the Generals
traveled to Emory & Henry,
looking to keep their season per-
fect. Unfortunately, the good
times came to an end for W&L
as it succumbed to E&H, 7-2.

Bill Sigler and Geoff Wikel
accounted forthe Generals’ only
two goals of the afternoon. Hill
finished with three saves for the
Generals, who slipped to 3-1
overall, 1-1 ODAC.

There was a lot more to keep
former Generals’ soccer players
entertained this weekend than
just watchingtheirsucessorsroll

to victory.

The W&L athletic depart-
ment celebrated the 50th season
of W&L soccer, including the
10th season of the women ’s pro-
gram, with three days of festivi-
ties. These included a cocktail
party and a banquet Friday
evening where former-‘coaches
and players spoke and~a video
depicting soccer moments over
the years was shown.

The former players got a
chance to strut their stuff once
again in an alumni soccer game
Saturday morning before being
treated to a pair of victories by
the current cast of Generals.

Quakers shake Generals, 24-10

BY BETHANY BAUMAN
PHI SPORTS EDrroR

The Quakers were not kind to
the Generals last Saturday.
Guilford College passed Wash-
ington and Lee 24-10 in the
teams’ first Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference game.

The Generals put the first
points of the day up in the sec-

ond quar-
ter on a 10-
yard pass
from quar-
terbackse-
n i o r
Brooks
Fischer to
sopho-
more Chas
Chastain.
T h e
touchdown topped off a 14 play,
86-yard drive.

Guilford scored later in the
second on a 22-yard field goal,
moving thescore to 7-2. But the
Quakers then took the lead with
63 seconds left in the half when
Guilford’s Junior Lord snagged
a 24-yard touchdown pass.
W&L senior defensive tackle
Peyton Williams blocked the
extra point to keep the score at 9-

7.

But the Generals were not
able to convert on the squib kick-
off and the Quakers got the ball
on their own 44-yard line. Lord
then extended the lead for
Guilford to 16-7 on a 39-yard
pass from quarterback Dan

Wilkinson, who ran for 79 yards
on 11 carries. Wilkinson has
been forced to step up for the
offense because tailbacks junior
Seth McKinley and sophomore
Floyd Young have both been
sidelined with injuries.

When Washington and Lee
sophomore Christine Starer, who
began riding at the age of four,
was looking at colleges, she nar-
rowed her choices to the Univer-
sity of Virginia and W&L. Her
major attraction to UVA was its
high-caliber riding team. She
chose W&Lanyway and decided
to start a riding team on her own.

Starer soon found out that
many W&L students have a lot
of talent and interest in riding.
While some students were still
competing and showing during
their college years, W&L did
not offer any opportunity for the
students to improve or compete
in a team atmosphere.

“Competition is much more
of a team effort. All the riding
during shows earns points for
the team, not the individual,”
said Starer, explaining why she
wanted a team to compete with
rather than showing on her own

Sophomore Lydia Nichols
has been riding and competing
for eleven years. She has won
numerous awards in South Caro-
lina, including two State Cham-
pionships.

tion for the offense were
Chastain and junior Nick Hodge,
who each snagged four catches.

Defensively, McGuire Boyd,
Jack Boyd and Williams turned

A in big performances. McGuire

Boyd led the team in tackles
with 14, including two quarter-
back sacks.

Jack Boyd also included a
sack in his career-high l0 tack-
les. Williams also had an im-
pressive game with 13 tackles
and two blocked kicks.

Theteam is disappointed with
the slow start to their season, but
they are not discouraged. Wil-
liams commented that two years
ago, the Generals, who started
out 0-3, ended the season 5-4.
He believes that, by compari-
son, this year’s squad has more
talent and is putting forth more
of an effort.

The Generals will be on the
road again Saturday as they
travel to Centre College in
Danville, Kentucky. The Colo-
nels have posted a 3-0 record so
far this sea'son.

Williams stated that the big-
gest challenge facing the Gener-
als tomorrow will be not making
the minor mistakes that have cost
them some crucial plays in their
two previous outings.

‘‘It makes you feel like you’re
not an athlete when you’re not
riding and competing,” said
Nichols, who is looking forward
to joining a team and bringing
recognition to W&L.

‘‘I didn’t get to ride much last

year while at school,” said-

sophomore Sarah Rector, who
has also won many titles includ-
ing the Gittings Horsemanship
Finals, a regional equitation
championship with participants
from Virginia, Maryland, Penn-
sylvania and Delaware. “Now
that it’s a club sport, it’s a good
excuse for me to rifle.”

The riding team also opens
up the opportunity for less-ex-
perienced riders. The team ros-
ter includes all levels, from be-
ginning walk-trot to the most
advanced Open Equitation.

Team members who have only 3

taken lessons before or who
haven’t shown since they were
younger have the opportunity to
improve and learn how to com-
pete with the help and encour-
agement of team members.

coach, graduated last spring from

College, where she was captain

Outing Club says ‘Take a hike!’

BY KELLY TOTIEN
PHI STAFF WRITER

S. R. Evens’ goal is to have Washington and Lee
students climbing the walls by winter term.

Evans, who graduated from W& L last spring, is the
school’s first Outing Club director. One of his projects
is to build a rock-climbing wall. The preliminary plan
is to work with the athletic department to convert one of
the racquetball courts into the climbing wall.

Evans’ position came into existence after a group of
W& L students, who spent the last three years looking
at other schools’ outing club programs, submitted a
proposal to Dean Howison and President Elrod. The
group found that the common factor among the success-
ful outdoors’ organizations was that each school paid
someone to run the program.

W&L agreed to a pilot program to be reevaluated at
the end of each year. The school was not ready to hire
a full-time professional, instead they hired Evans on a
one-year internship with part-time job expectations.

The new position is not the only change in the Outing
Club this year. Students must become members to rent
equipment and take part in activities. A membership fee
of $15 entitles the student to unlimited use of equipment
as well as transportation and food for all local trips.
More expensive activities, such as white water rafting
will cost an additional fee.

The equipment rental policy had also undergone
some organizational changes. Last year, the Outing
Club had _to take on an aggressive attitude to recover
many lost items. They had enough records to know who

had checked out what
equipment and were able to
ﬁnd the items or charge the
students who had lost the
equipment. Evans esti-
mates that the club lost less
than $300-$400 out of over
$10,000 in equipment the
club owns. Now, if stu-
dents turn in equipment af-
ter the one-week deadline,
they will be ﬁned a $10 late
fee per item.
At the first two Outing
Club meetings, held the past
two Wednesdays at 7 p.m.,
approximately 35 people at-
tended, more than double
the number from previous
years. Along with a boost
in popularity, the Outing
Club has increased the num-
ber of organized activities,
including Freshmen Day
Hikes, which the Outing
Club sponsored the first week of school.
. Besides hikes, mountain bike trips and rock climb-
ing expeditions, Outing Club members can participate
in activities during the week. Monday at 8 p.m., the club
offers kayak-rolling lessons in the small pool in Doremus
Gymnasium; between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. on Wednes-
days, members can attend bike maintenance workshops

College students across the
nation revealed their sexual

of Playboy. Now, the Ring-

are doing it in dorm rooms, libraries,

and, on occasion, in their parents’ beds.”

That’swhat Playboy magazine found
in its college sex survey. We want to
know what W&L students up to.

About half of college students na-
tionwide are getting lucky about once a
week, the survey found, and nine out of
10 students are sexually active.

The students that answered the sur-
vey questions did not know they were
responding to a Playboy survey. Profes-
sors at a dozen colleges from California
to Maine administered the 152-item sur-
vey to their classes.

W&L was not among them, so we’re
doing our own survey. A few people
gave their take on sex at W&L, but we’d
like a more thorough sampling. So fill
out the accompanying survey and return
it to The Ring-tum Phi mailbox on the
second ﬂoor of the university center.

Meanwhile, here’s what Playboy
found:

*The average college student has sex
twice a week. ‘‘I haven’t been here that
long, but I would guess that freshman
aren’t really having sex that often,” said
one freshman girl.

‘Most respondents practice serial
monogamy, or having sex with only
one partner. “Sex at W&L is ran-

Area students share grief

BY DAviD BALSLEY
Pm FEATURES EorroR

The Grief Support Group will hold its
first meeting on Wednesday, October 9.
The group’s ﬂier describes it as “a sup-
port group for any student who has expe-
rienced the death of a family member or
friend. The focus will be on the grief
experience and learning how to handle
the loss and changes.”

“lt’s a support group to help students
learn to develop the tools necessary to
deal with their grief,” stated Amy Hefty.

Hefty will conduct the group along
with Mickey Watkins, a fellow Hospice
worker. Hospice is a Lexingtonian orga-
nization dedicated to helping the dying
to pass away with dignity.

University Counseling will not run
the group, but Dean Anne C. Schroer-
Lamont commented that the group’s
reputability has led University Counsel-
ing to endorse the program.

Studentsinvolvedinthe program will
help each other with their unique needs.
The students progress from becoming
comfortable with one another to talking
about their loss and their experiences.
“That comfort level increases as time
goes on,” Hefty commented.

The first three sessions of the Grief
Support Group’s six sessions are fairly
structured, with topics ﬂexibly sched-
uled for each session. At the end of the
third session, the students will express
their concerns and needs, which will
form the content of the remaining three
sessions.

Topics which will be covered by the
group include anger, guilt, dealing with
special days such as a loved one’s birth-
day, and others. “We try to tailor it to the
students’ needs,” Hefty stated.

The Grief Support Group differs from
previous support-style groups in several
respects. First, the program will involve
students from Mary Baldwin College,
Southern Virginia College,VirginiaMili-
tary Institute, and Washington and Lee
University.

“lt’s the first time we have tried to do
a college program for students in con-
junction with Virginia Military lnstitute,”
stated Schroer-Lamont.
group will exclude non-students.

Schroer-Lamont commented that stu-
dents who had participated in previous
support groups thought that “it would be
very helpful to have a group for only
students.”

The Grief Support Group differs from
the Peer Counselling Program. Although
the Peer Counsellors are capable of lis-
tening to those who have suffered from
the loss of a loved one, the leaders of the
Grief Support Group have "specific train-
ing and specific techniques for helping
those in grief," explained Schroer-
Lamont.

The group will meet on Wednesday
evenings from 7:30 to 9:00 p.m. in the
Scout Room of the Educational Building
at R.E. Lee Memorial Church. The group
will host six sessions between October 9
through November 20; no session will be
held on November 6.

Students interested in joining the Grief
Support Group should registerwith Carol
Caulkins’ ofﬂce as soon as possible, pref-
erably before Wednesday, October 9.

Hefty would like to limit the member-
ship of the group to those students who
are present at the first meeting in order to
ensure that the students feel comfortable
with one another.

There is a fee associated with the

group.

ln addition to the new format, a new control mixing

“The station will also be receiving a satellite dish

Bob deMaria, WLUR general manager, said. The opera
will be broadcasted December through April.

Programming runs from 7 a.m. until midnight. The
eclectic mix of music, news and sports is produced
mostly by students. The station, which has been on the

ache Machine,” a show which has run continuously
since 1972 when he was a student here. The show
runs from 9 p.m. to midnight on Saturdays.

Sophomores Tom Wadlow and Cliff Wooley host
“The Boot Record,” a 3-hour talk show which pro-
vides on-air computing help in addition to commen-
tary on topics of the computing subject. Wadlow and
Wooley wired the production room to receive phone
calls so the show,which airs from 9 a.m. until noon on
Thursdays, will include live calls. The show can be
also be contacted through e-mail at

A common complaint among civic-
minded W&Lstudents is that there aren’t
enough opportunities to become involved
in the Lexington community. Habitat for
Humanity is trying to remedy that.

Made famous by President Jimmy
Carter, Habitat provides affordable
housing to the needy, using donated
materials, labor, and money. Habitat
allows volunteers the unique opportunity
of actually building houses. Residents
are required to pay “sweat equity”, that is
they are required to contribute a certain
number hours of-wo1=k;t’o the house. After
the house is ﬁnished, they repay the cost
with an interest-free loan. This allows
low-income families an opportunity to
own what is usually their first house. The
monthly payment for Habitat’s last house
was $125 dollars.

Last spring, W&L’s Habitat chapter
was able to begin construction of their
second house. Senior Brad Philipson, a
Habitat volunteer, said he hopes they
will be able to complete the project by
December and begin a new house next
spring.

The W&L chapter has no formal
membership. Every Saturday, interested
students gather and head to the work site.
“We average about a dozen people per
week,” said Philipson. “But there’s

Tin Cup:
Kevin Costner returns

was of 4 stars;
good-hearted

The pitch: “It’II
be like JFK
meets

 ”

Alex Christensen
Phi Movie Critic

in Cup is a movie with very bad timing, at least in its

appearance at the box office. Though it did well in

terms of ticket sales (about $50 million so far), it

comes at a time when the obvious “giant” of golf movies is

Adam Sandler’s brilliant absurdist masterpiece, Happy

Gilmore. Tin Cup is good; Happy Gilmore is likely to become
a classic.

Nevertheless, Tin Cup is worth seeing as well. Don’t make
it a golf double feature, though.

Tin Cup is the story of Roy “Tin Cup” McAvoy, a loserwho
owns a desolate driving range in the godfcrsaken town of
Salome, Texas. It's hard to see how the operation is even
managing to keep Roy in beer and stained shirts, since it has
no visible patronage or anything that might attract it. Cheech
Marin is Romeo Posar, manager of the range and someone
who apparently has nothing better to do than hang out in the
dust with loser Roy.

Everything changes with the arrival of psychiatrist Dr.
Molly Griswold (Rene Russo). She wants to take golf lessons
so she can keep up with her boyfriend (and Roy’s old college
golﬁng buddy/rival), David Simms (Don Johnson). But,
naturally, Roy falls hard for Molly. To impress her, he tries
to work out his problems in therapy, asks her out, and finally
decides to try to qualify for the U.S. Open tournament so he
can prove that he can actually accomplish what he sets out to
do without defeating himself like he usually does.

(I won’t give away the ending. The studio asked audiences
not to, even though it doesn’t make that much of a difference.
Getting there is all the fun of Tin Cup.)

Rene Russo (In the Line of Fire, Get Shorty) is clearly the
star of this film by Ron Shelton, the director of Bull Durham,
White Men Can ’t Jump, and the acting tour-de-force Cobb.
Indeed, Rene Russo is the star of the moment. She will appear
in the upcoming Ransom with Mel Gibson, and was consid-
ered to play Dr. Chase Meridian in Batman Forever before
Michael Keaton bowed out and Joel Schumacher was allowed
to come in and bollocks up the whole franchise. It’s easy to
see why she’s so in demand: With her wonderful smile and
stellar comic timing, Russo easily steals the show from Kevin
Costner, Don Johnson, and Cheech Marin.

They’re far from overwhelmed, however. Kevin Costner
gives one of his best performances. (“Even better than
Waterworld?” you ask. Yes, even better than Waterworld.)
Actually, Costner is quite good as a loser trying to make his big
comeback after everyone else has dismissed him.
Hmmm...where could he have gotten the motivation for that
kind of a role? How could he ever find the necessary
identification with such a character to be able to put it on
screen convincingly? Hmmm.... Anyway, the old, charming
Costner is back this time around. One of my female friends,
who shall remain nameless, actually raves about the sex
appeal which oozes from Mr. Costner as he lies on the bed in
the ramshackle trailer his and Cheech Marin’s character share,
beer in hand, undershirt stained with the sweat of a sweltering
Texas afternoon. Okay. I just take herword forit. I mean, he’s
charming and entertaining, certainly, but I can’t understand
my friend’s low guttural growl whenever she hears anything
about Tin Cup. I just don’t think it’s justiﬁed.

Cheech Marin and Don Johnson are the comic relief from
the golf and the romance. They do the job nicely.

Still, the Happy Gilmore comparison bothers me. The golf
was more entertainingly shot and fast-paced, the comic timing
was beyond superb, and the writing great enough to be
admired for years. Tin Cup is slower, longer, less sure of its
structure and footing. Still, it is a lot of fun and a bit of
romance, and you might even learn a valuable life lesson that’s
not as pat as the usual Hollywood cliché.

Bill Pelke doesn’t quite fit in here.

He stands before the audience in his
black t-shirt and blue jeans. His white
tennis shoes are scuffed. His beard and
ﬂoppy hair are highlighted by strands of
white. The audience is a group of fresh-
faced Washington and Lee law students
— all neatly dressed in their khakis and
Gap dresses, an attractive bunch straight
out oftheir upper middle-class suburbs.

But Bill has a story to tell, and the
lawyers-to-be have come to hear it. He
tells it in the simple prose of an Indiana
native. Plain language. Plain truth. He
knows no other way to tell it. Bill knows
they’re concerned with the law, but he
wants to put a human face on their stud-
ies. Someone real. Someone he loved.

On May 14, 1984, four girls decided
to hook school. They went to the ar-
cades to play video games and hang out.
But when they got there, they realized
they didn’t have any money. Stumped,
they began searching for a way to pick
up a few extra dollars.

Then it hit them.

  

One girl knew this elderly woman in
her neighborhood who gave Bible les-
sons to children. She would invite inter-
ested kids into her home where she would
teach them the stories of the Bible. Us-
ing her hand-stitched story pillows as
visual aids, the 78-year-old woman
would tell the children of Joseph and his
coat or Moses and the sea. She was a
woman of faith and was eager to share it
with everyone. Especially children. She
was also Bill’s grandmother.
So the girls went to her house under
the pretense of asking her for a Bible
lesson. Bill’s grandmother invited them
in. When she turned around, one girl
picked up a vase and smashed her in the
back of the head. Another pulled out a
knife and began to stab her. Thirty
times. The carpet underneath her body
was shredded from the sheer force of the
stab wounds. When the crime scene
investigators pulled back the carpet, they
found the hard wood ﬂoors had been
splintered from the power of the thrusts.
Bill’s grandmother bled to death on
the dining room ﬂoor where she had
served meals to her families. Where she
had taught her children to love Jesus.
Where she had laughed and cried and

built a life. Now she was dead.

The girls left the apartment with ten‘
dollars and the keys to the car. Police.

finally caught them after they had taken

the car back to school where they were

giving joy-rides to friends.

According to the law, the girls were
juveniles: 14, 15, 16, and 16. Due to the

In high school, homecoming

Twas a much bigger deal than here.

The tools on student council al-
ways wanted to make it into aweek

beginning. We were the Moline
Maroons. What’s a maroon? I
‘have no idea. I’m pretty sure they
were just looking for an allitera-
Etion. Our school fight song wasn’t
;very inspiring either. The first two
lines were, “we are Moliners.

jMaroons were so bad that every
year, we’d pay another school with

once. They must have had no

watch the Maroons lose.

My first "homecoming date was
also pretty memorable. His name
was Kevin, and he and I ran cross
country together. I agreed to go
with him because (1) I wanted to
go to the dance, (2) my friend Apryl
was going with his friend Ryan, so
we could double, and (3) he was a
sophomore and I was a freshman;
instant cool. Unfortunately, Kevin
had a big crush on me. I’ll never
know why. I was fourteen with
braces and every time he saw me I
was sweaty. '

Still, every time I turned around,
he was gazing at me lovingly.
Unfortunately for him, Kevin was
a really shy guy and couldn’t talk
to me. This did notistop him from
calling me every night. Even then
he didn’t talk to me. I’d hear
breathing and his 2 Live Crew tapes
until I made up an excuse to get off

the phone.
The night ofthe dance, Apryl

was my best ally. I was trying
to dodge Kevin; she was trying
to dodge Ryan. We planned a
strategy to avoid having them
kiss us goodnight. Allow him
to walk you to the door. Then,
at that moment just before you
open the door, when he might
try to plant one on you, drop
your purse Luckily, even after
watching Apryl successfully use
this plan, it worked for me too.
Homecoming here just
hasn’t been as exciting, but I
do have a few special memo-

drink too much. Hey, don’t

Decision ’96: Dole Vs. Clinton

Issue #2: Military Spending

When the Air Force has to hold a

Countdown to the
election. . .

32 DAYS

From  the Left
Laura Knapp"99

The election is just over a month away, and
Clinton seems to have an insumountable lead.

This week, the issue under consideration is
military spending. This hot topic is going to be
a major point of contention in the presidential

and congressional debates.

Since the end of the Cold War,ﬁthe United
States has placed the military under a micro-
scope (with lowmagniﬂcation). This has occured
with a new intensiﬁcation on domestic issues.
Both Democrats and Republicans have cut mili-
tary spending, but politics has dictated the cuts.
N 0 politician wants to cut a military program in

his/her district.

On the right this week is Jason Zacher ’98,
The Ring -tum Phi Editorial Editor. On the left
will be Laura Knapp, ’97, our Democratic

columnist.

Is the military a bloated, over-protected
buerocracy, ora vital interest to/tmerica ? Where
will the challenges lie in the future ? Why do we
continue to maintain the size of our military
when other domestic problems are being ne-
glected? If you have these questions, we hope

this will help answer them.

Editorial Editor

tives.

The topic of this week’s column — military
spending —— is the most appropriate follow-up to
last week’s column concerning the state of public
education. The contrast between these two issues
is what divides and defines liberals and conserva-

One of my favorite bumper stickers is the one
that reads, “It will be a perfect world when the
schools will have all the money they need, and the

A Air Force has to hold a bake sale to buy a bomber.”
This seemingly innocent display of irony gets
down to the meat and potatoes of this debate.

It can be safely stated that military spending in
the United States is out of control and must be
stopped. At a time when Republicans in Congress
are slashing important domestic programs such as
education, welfare and environmental protection,
the US government is spending gross amounts of
taxpayer funds to maintain a huge military com-
plex that is, in effect, rotting away in ship-yards
and hangers across the nation, never to be used in
this age of diplomatic, economic, and multilateral
intervention, through organizations like the UN.

The Cold War is over. There is no imminent
threat of war, nuclear holocaust or even a Commu-
nist revolution in our midst. We have won and we
did not even have to fire a state of relative peace. If
this is the case, then why does the United States
continue to spend $492 billion - practically the
same amount spent during the waning days of the
Cold War - on military-related purchases? Why do

bake sale to buy a bomber. . .

American children sit in over-crowded
classrooms with out-dated books taught
by over-worked and under-paid teachers?

The answer is simply mixed-up priori-
ties on the part of the conservatives that, at
present, control our government. If to be
a liberal means that I think the US should
spend its money on teaching a child how to

read rather than buying an M-16, then I’ll
stand on the top of Washington Hall and
yell it to all of W&L and Lexington.

The money that Americans pay in taxes
ought to be returned to the community, in
the form of domestic programs. A cut in
military spending could bring a tax—cut
that the Republicans have been itching to
give. What makes more sense to you?
Finding an American child’s education
and in turn, his future of funding a pro-
gram that has the ability to destroy child’s
future in a different country. It’s a simple
choice for me.

Preserving international strength in the “new world order”

From the Right
Jason Zacher ’98 H

The Ring-Tum Phi Editorial Editor

With the United States sitting

on top of the heap in the “new
world order,” it is very easy to
become complacent. The specter
of communism is gone, and dicta-
tors like Saddam Hussein have been
put in their place, so why,,should
we continue to spend hundreds of
billions of dollars on defense?

Our military mission has long
been the ability to fight two re-
gional wars at once, but the Bush-
Clinton military spending cuts have
placed that mission injeopardy. In
this world where the United States
is the lone hegemon, there are still
challenges, challenges that scholar
Paul Kennedy calls, “diffuse and
numerous.”

Russia is experiencing a power
crisis now, with Boris Yeltsin’s
health failing and the communist
party experiencing a resurgence in
popularity. Transfers of power in
Russia have never been clean and
easy. Islamic fundamentalism in
the Middle East and North Africa
threatens US interests overseas.
With the possible exception of our
backyard, there are threats to US
security and interests in every cor-
ner of the world. Though these
threats may not be apparent now,
we cannot see 10-15 years down
the road. Go back to 1925 and take

a poll to see if anyone thinks Ger-
many will try to take over Europe
in eleven years.

The world’s rogue states, Iraq,
Iran, Libya, Syria, North Korea,
and Cuba are all staunchly anti-
American. None of them can di-
rectly threaten our territory now
(with the possible but unlikely ex-
ception of Cuba), but they can chal-
lenge ourinterests overseas. Japan
could be a prime target of Japan,
and with North Korea comes China.
Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya can all
seriously challenge the world’s oil
supply, and, like it or not, oil is a
vital US economic interest.

The Clinton administration has
probably correctly predicted that
missile attacks from secondary
powers are still a decade away, but
has incorrectly decided to put off
preparing for ourdefense until then.
Clinton has slashed spending on
technologies (much to the dismay
of defense-minded Democrats like
former Congressman Les Aspin
and former Senator Sam Nunn),
even though it was this technologi-
cal superiority that allowed us to
walk over Hussein in 1990.
Clinton’s first error: technology is
incremental and must be constantly
researched, playing catch-up in
defense can be a deadly game.

Former Secretary of Defense
Aspin and his deputy John Deutsch
completedia bottom-up review of
spending in 1993, a review that
was hampered by Clinton’s im-
posed spending limits. They de-

signed a force that would be able to
complete our military mission, but
a force that the General Account-
ing Office, the Congressional Bud-
get Office, and an independently
assembled group of former chiefs
of staff have decided is anywhere
from $50-$150 million short of
that goal.

Yes, it is true that we have won

“Go back to

to take over
Europe in
eleven years.”

recent skirmishes in Grenada,
Panama, and Iraq, but these are
only skirmishes, and were won
because of Carter’s and Reagan’s
defense spending. The money we
spend now will help us 10-15 years
from now, when we cannot see the
challenges ahead. Defense spend-
ing accounts for only 4 percent of

our GDP, the lowest it has been
since the mid 1920’s.
Every country that has been at

_the top of the heap has fallen at

some point, but the United States
can learn from history by not be-
coming complacent.

The first president of the twenty-
first century needs to concentrate
spending in technologies that can
help smaller quick-response forces
gain the upper hand against any
opponent.

There are plenty of ways to cut
costs without cutting the size of
our force. Closing useless and
unnecessary military bases is one
way; not to mention the numerous
relics of the Cold War that should
just be eliminated. But both of
these have fallen victim to domes-
tic politics. K

Our problems in the intema-
tional arena are not all spending
related either. Clinton has had
extreme troubles getting our allies
to support us, and has switched
policies so many times in so many
foreign countries, that we could
devote an entire issue of The Ring-
tum Phi to write about them.

Speaker NewtGingrich saidthat
military spending is probably too
high for our needs at this time, but
it is the price to pay for being on
top. I could not agree more. If we
are to continue as the strongest
nation in the world, we cannot sim-
ply be stronger than our challeng-
ers, we need to be head and shoul-
ders above them.

give. And he did. Paulashouldn’tdie.
His grandmother wouldn’t have
wanted it that way and neither did Bill.

Before that day, Bill had remem-
bered his grandmother with pain. He
pictured her lying there on the dining
room floor, bleeding and in pain. He
was in turmoil. But the day he for-
gave,everythingchanged. He remem-
bered his grandmother with laughter,
love, and faith — the way she had
lived, not the way she died.

Bill began to write Paula. He told
her about his grandmother, her faith,
her love for children, and her stitched
pillows that told the stories of the
Bible. He learned that Paula was

« raised in an abusive family where hate

prevailed, not love. Paula began to
take classes in prison. She completed
high school, earning straight A’s, and
then started taking college courses.
Through their correspondence, Bill
saw her become a different person.

One day, producers from an Italian
news organization called Bill. They
wanted him to come on their show and
talk about the case. You see, most
Europeans were simply amazed by
the story. Virtually all of the Euro-
pean democracies had abolished the
death penalty by that time, and they
didn’t understand how the United
States could kill a 15-year-old-girl.
They wanted Bill to explain.

So Bill went to Italy. He met with
Italian politicians, papal representa-
tives, and organizers of a petition drive
called “Don’t Kill.” Over three mil-
lion European people had signed the
petition to save a little girl in Indiana
named Paula Cooper. Bill sympa-
thized with their efforts. He too
c@uldn’t understand why she should
be put to death.

Under the international spotlight,
Indiana was a little embarrassed. Af-
ter all, theircapital punishment statute
held that a criminal as young as 12
could be sentenced to death. To avoid
further humiliation, the Indiana legis-
lature raised the age to 16. That didn’t
help Paula. She was still on Death
Row. And the public outrage contin-
ued to boil.

Paula’s case was eventually ap-
pealed to the Indiana state Supreme
Court. The court commuted Paula’s
sentence to 60 years in prison. Bill

and his European colleagues had
achieved success. They had saved
Paula’s life. He was able to do for
Paula what he wasn’t able to do for his
grandmother. He had made a differ-
ence.

In 1993, Bill went back to Indiana
to march with a group called Murder
Victims Families for Reconciliation.
MVFR is a group of murder victims
families who seek alternatives to the
death penalty. They come together to
share their experiences and commit
themselves to the notion that killing
-—— all killing — is wrong. During the
group’s two-week project, Bill trav-
eled throughout the state telling the
story of his grandmother and Paula
Cooper.

Ever since then, Bill has traveled
the nation on a “journey of hope.” He
has dedicated his life to the abolition
of the death penalty. He attends pro-
tests, gives lectures, and organizes
grass roots organizations to help him
in his crusade. From appearances on
“Oprah Winfrey” and “Good Morn-
ing America” to abolitionist rallies,
Bill spends every day ﬁghting capital
punishment.

Bill’sjourney of hope is a terminal
one for he promises to march on until
the day he dies. At first, he marched
for himself, his grandmother, and Paula
Cooper. Today, it’s much more than
that —— Bill marches for the thousands
of Americans who simply want the
killing to stop.

tre pass at the W&L 10-yard line
with six seconds remaining.

W&L head coach Frank
Miriello was pleased with his
team’s come-from-behind road
victory. One of the high points
of Saturday’s game, according
to Miriello, was the improved
performance of the offensive
line. The o-line, which returned
only one of last year’s starters,
has “come to maturity” after
struggling to generate an offense
in the Generals’ ﬁrst two games.

Rueger, who made the transi-
tion from receiver back to his
natural quarterback position for
injured Brooks Fischer, also
gave a great performance against
Centre. In addition to scoring
two touchdowns, he completed
12 passes for 185 yards.

“The win at Centre was a real
important one for the team...We
know that we can win even with
our backs against the wall like
they were last week,” Rueger
said.

The Generals have another

challenging game scheduled for
Homecoming. They will meet
the Randolph-Macon Yellow
Jackets at 2 p.m. tomorrow on
Wilson Field.

Rueger hopes the Generals
will have a successful Home-
coming.

“We want to win this Home-
coming this weekend over
Randolph-Macon,” he said.
“They are a tough team that has
beaten us the last few years, but
we have a lot of conﬁdence go-
ing into this game after our win
last week.

“Nothing would be nicer to
beat them in front of our home
crowd.”

The Yellow Jackets are a fa-
vorite for the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference title. But
Miriello believes that his team,
although they will have to play a
near-perfect game, can “Beat the
Best”.

He said, “We’ll be there at
the end, and hopefully we can
pull it off.”

Tennis teams make strong showings in
Rolex Southeastern Regional tourney

BY Scorr BOOKWALTER
PHI Srorus EDITOR

The Washington and Lee tennis teams gave great
performances last weekend in one of the biggest
tournaments of the year.

The W&Lwomen had six singles players advance
to the round of 16 and a doubles team win the
championship at the Rolex Southeastern Regional
tournament, held at Mary Washington College in
Fredericksburg. The W&L men, who were hosting
the men’s Rolex tournament, placed a singles player
and a doubles team into the semiﬁnals.

Women’s tennis coach Cinda Rankin was de-
lighted with her team’s play at Mary Washington.

“It was fantastic,” she said. “l was just very, very
pleased with everybody’s play.”

She said the performances were especially pleas-
ing because the team has a lot of young players, and
other teams at the tournament had been practicing
longer since they had started school earlier.

Junior Ericka Shapard was the tournament star as
she ﬁnished runner-up in the singles bracket and
teamed up with junior Berry Blankinship to capture
the doubles crown and advance to the Rolex Division
III championships.

Shapard, the number-one seed overall in the singles
bracket, stormed out of the gate in amazing fashion
by winning 36 out of 37 games in her ﬁrst three
matches. Things got a little more tense in the
quarterﬁnals when she faced Blankinship, but Shapard
dispatched her doubles partner, 6-2, 6-3. Shapard
then encountered even tougher opposition in the
semiﬁnals by yet another teammate, freshman Brook
Hartzell. Hartzell hung tough but Shapard ﬁnally
outlasted her, 7-6 (5), 7-5.

Mary Washington’s Kirsten Erickson, the num-
ber-two seed, spoiled Shapard’s run by defeating the
junior in the title game, 7-5, 6-1.

Still, Rankin was very impressed by her top
player’s performance.

 

“She has stepped up from the number-two spot (last
year) to be our number-one player,” Rankin said.

Besides Shapard, Blankinship and Hartzell, senior
Anna O’Connor, sophomore Mary Celeste Foster and
freshman Erin Eggers also made it to the round of 16 in
singles.

Rankin also cited the play of sophomore Laura Cohen,
W&L’s number-eight player, who lost in the ﬁrst round
to Shea Rickard of Emory & Henry but then proceeded to
reach the semiﬁnals in the consolation bracket.

and Blankinship torched their opponents in their ﬁrst

fourmatches, losing only 3 games out of 5 1 . This earned
the W&L duo a ticket to the ﬁnals where Shapard saw
a familiar face in Mary Washington’s Erickson, the
player who ousted her in the singles title.

History would not repeat itself. Shapard gained
revenge as she and Blankinship destroyed Erickson and
Leah Morris, the top-seeded team, 6-2, 6-1 . The victory
earned the W&L pair a place in the Rolex Division III
championships. '

Rankin is looking forward to the trip to the national
Rolex tournament.

“By the time we go there, we’ll have more practice
and should play even better,” she said.

The women’s team will next be in action Monday the
14th, when they face a tough Carnegie Mellon team.
Carnegie Mellon’s number-one player beat W&L’s
Natalia Garcia last year, so the Generals will have their
work cut out for them.

“I think it’s a very good test of our players,” Rankin
said.

The men’s tennis" team also fared well in the Rolex
tournament. The Generals placed two players in the
singles quarterﬁnals. Sophomore Dale Pretila, seeded
11th, advanced to the semifinals after upending 4th seed
Chris Wallace of Mary Washington, 1-6, 7-6(2), 6-2.
But second seed and eventual champion Miro Beran of
Washington College proved too tough in the semis,
knocking out Pretila, 6-1, 6-2.

Senior Peter Hammond also had a strong run through
the singles bracket, winning three matches to get to the
quarterﬁnals, before he was halted by top seed Doug
Neagle of Salisbury State, 6-4, 6-1.

Pretila and Hammond then teamed up in doubles to
cruise through their first two matches before running
into teammates Tom Washburn and Damian Brady in

the quarterfinals. Pretila and Hammond prevailed in
three games, 6-1, 6-7(5), 6-3, to advance to the semiﬁ-
nals, but were knocked off there by Salisbury State’s
Neagle and Nathan Bell, 6-1, 6-2.

The men will conclude their fall season next week-
end when they host the W&L Fall Classic. Matches will
start at 9 a.m. both days.

The week preceeding Making Strides, Chi
Omega sponsored a Favorite Dog Contest
in front of the Co-op. Charging 25 cents
per vote, the proceeds benefited the
American Cancer Society.

 

BY KELLEY TOTTEN
PHI STAFF WRITER

A 5-mile walk on Sunday will do more than just
exercise your legs. It will raise money for the American
Cancer Society.

“Making Strides Against Cancer,” the annual char-
ity event co-sponsored by the Catholic Campus Minis-
try and Chi Omega sorority, asks members of the
Washington and Lee University and Lex-
ington communities to give hope to cancer
survivors and raise money to help with
patient services, education and research.

“There’s a real need for people to be
aware that cancer is not a death sentence,”
said organizer Laura Seaman. “Some
people have a hard time dealing with it, and this is a
good way to start.” .

The walk has personal meaning for Burr Datz, Catho-
lic Campus Minister.

“I had a grandmother who died from cancer and
cancer patients who have participated in the walk who
have since passed away,” said Datz. “They may be
gone, but they are not forgotten.”

Registration for Making Strides begins at 1 p.m.
Sunday in front of Harris Teeter on East Nelson Street.
The walk starts at 1:30. A $5 donation covers the
registration fee.

“We’re encouraging participants to collect pledges,
but it’s not mandatory,” Seaman said.

Students who would like to participate in the Outing
Club’s Mountain Day on Sunday can also register and
collect pledges for Making Strides.

Past events with 50-110 people par-
ticipating have raised between $500-
$1,600, and Datz hopes to match the high
by raising $1,600 this year.

Tim Phillips, a W&L law professor
who was a close friend of Datz, died two
years ago from cancer.

“He was a great, great guy who never let his cancer
get_him down. He provided a lot of hope to other cancer
patients,” said Datz. “Hopefully, we can continue to
provide that hope.”

For more information on Making Strides, contact
Laura Seamen at 463-1929 or Burr Datz at 463-3533. If
you are interested in combining Mountain Day and

Thank God it’s Fridays!

New group provides alternatives

BY B.J. WALKER
Pl-II STAFF WRITER

So, it’s Friday night, you’re ready to
relax but not in the fraternity party mood.
Until this year, that would mean an event-
ful evening of re-runs and pizza. The
Fridays! Committee is trying to do some-
thing about that.

Fridays! books an act to perform ev-
ery Friday night, usually at nine. So far,
a variety of acts have been scheduled:
from comedians to bands. There’s even
a Karaoke night and a hypnotist sched-
uled. The decision on who to book is
made by a committee.

“We’ve looked at tapes of everybody
from people on Saturday Night Live to

people that no one has ever heard of,”
said Sarah Moore, vice-president of Fri-
daysL

Fridays! tries to avoid the typical W&L
frat bands. “We’re going for diversity,”
said junior Megan Weidmaier. They also
move the location of the performances
weekly. “Because there are so many
sophomores in Gaines this year, we’ve
scheduled stuff there. But there’s still
stuff in the GHQ and Lenfest. “

Fridays! doesn’t intend to cater to
only freshmen and independents. It is
also not ment to replace parties as W&L
students activity of choice on Fridays.
“We don’t want people to be forced to
choice between their friends and parties
and Fridays!,” said Moore. “It’s just sup-

posed to be an alternative.

“The events are scheduled so they
wrap-up by 10:30. “They finish early so
students can still go out afterwards.”

Attendance so far has varied. Come-
dian Greer Barnes drew a crowd of sev-
eral hundred at Lenfest; however, he
never showed up. Fortunately, a couple
of last minute replacements were able to

fill in.

Since then, the crowds have thinned.
Last week we had about five people. I
think most people are not sure what to

expect,” said Moore.

This Friday, a funk/ska band, The
Riots, will perform in the GHQ at 9:30.
As always, admission is free and refresh-

ments will be provided.

Williamson, who took over Peter
Hoogenboom’s position in the music
department this year, received a
bachelor's degree in sacred music
from James Madison University and
a master’s in choral conducting and
vocal performance from Westminster
Choir College.

Dr. Gordan Spice, head of the
music department, thought the pieces
Williamson chose were challenging.
He liked the selections from George
Shearing’s “Music to Hear,” which
gave Shakespeare’s poetry a jazzy
beat.

“[Williamson] has injected a new
amount of energy that was evident
from the looks on members’ faces,”
said Dr. Spice.

Several chorus members thought
his enthusiasm really affected the cho-
rus’ positive attitude.

“It’s fun to go to rehearsal,” said
Detter. “I think that unity comes
through during the performance.”

I hate Parents Weekend.

Sure, I know it’s a few weeks
away, but I’m hoping some of you
will read this and take it to heart.

Right now, Parents Weekend is
my least favorite W&L event by
far. Granted, l’ve been an orphan
here for three years, so maybe you
could argue that I haven’t truly
experienced it. I prefer to think
that as an outsider I can better
observe the absurdity that goes on
here every year in late October.

Parents Weekend is not what is
should be. It should be a time for
our parents to get to know us as
adults. To see where we live, to
meet our friends, to see the fine,
independent, responsible adults
they have raised.

It should be a chance to relate to
our parents not as children, but in
an aura of mutual respect. Think

“Rule of thumb:
if you have
breasts, you are
too old to walk
around holding

your dad ‘s
hand. ”

of how much you’ve grown and
changed at Washington and Lee.
Parents Weekend ought to be a
time for families to feel proud of
these accomplishments. For rela-
tionships among families to reach
a new level.

Instead, we regress.

Every year, I see and am dis-

status

gusted by the way my friends and
classmates seem to be. For the
weekend, anyway, about nine years
old. Look around you:

- The smart girl in your German
class is bickering with her little
brother over who gets to sit in the
front seat.

- Your Homecoming date is al-
lowing his mom to call him Pookie.

- People who managed to bathe
and feed themselves are now ask-
ing mom to do the dishes.

- Your best friend is pretending
she has no idea how to clean the
lint trap in the dryer.

- Meanwhile, your mom just
spit into a Kleenex and is using it to
wash your face. Why is everyone
acting so pathetic?

This year, let's make Parents
Weekend what it should be. Stop
dragging your parents to random
cultural events, unless it’s some-
thing they’d actually enjoy. In-
stead, why not take awalk together
so they can get to know the new
you? Don’t try to pretend to be

someone you’re not.
If your parents take you out to

dinner Friday night, why not make
them dinner on Saturday, to thank
them for all they have done — and
to show off your new practical
knowledge?

If you don’t act childish (i.e.:
call your brother “Pukey,” have
nothing in your fridge but half a
can of Diet Coke, whine, etc.)
maybe your mom will let you wash
your own face. And this is a per-
sonal pet peeve, but 1 am always
disturbed by the way girls hang on
their dads. Rule of thumb: if you
have breasts, you are too old to
walk around holding your dad’s
hand.

I hate Parents Weekend, but I
don’t have to. Please try not to
regress, and instead just be you.
Your parents might actually like it
better.

you eat enough of them.”

Decision ’96: Dole Vs. Clinton
Issue #3: The Leviathan

Government is not the ‘root of all evil’

Countdown to the
election...

25
DAYS

The 1 996 Presidential and Congressional elec-
tions are about three weeks away, and President
Clinton still is sitting on a comfortable, double-
digit lead in the polls.

This week, the issue we will fearlessly discuss
in The Ring-tum Phi is the size of our federal
government. This is another topic that seems to»

always be in the debate, but-because of recent:

Republican actions in Congress, is ‘especially
relevant.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt started the
government ’s major expansion with entitlement
programs during the Great Depression.‘ These
were years during which, drastic actions needed
to be taken, but his actions were meant to be
temporary. Lyndon Johnson expanded it further
with his "Great Society. " This, however, has
created a government that seems to have a life of
its own.

It seems that everywhere we go, and every-
thing we do, the federal government has some
regulation or standard that we run into. This is
true of everything from public safety to our
private lives.

On the right this week isJason Zacher ’98,
The Ring-tum Phi Editorial Editor. On the left
will be Laura Knapp, ’97, our Democratic
columnist.

Is the government too large ? Should some of
its programs be stripped? Can the states truly
deal with their problems effectively, or is the
federal government needed to create continuity
among the states? If you have these questions,
we hope this will help answer them.

- Jason Zacher
Editorial Editor

From the Left
Laura Knapp ’99

One of the Republican battlecries of the past
few election seasons is that the federal govem-
ment is the root of all evil in American society
and that if elected, they will slash the authority of
the federal government. Insinuating that any-
thing that the federal government touches turns
into a bureaucratic nightmare, Republican hypo-
crites like Bob Dole, a Washington bureaucrat
himself running for the most important position
in the federal government while at the same time
planning its demise, advocate the idea that indi-
vidual state governments are the most efficient
and can best serve the interest oflthecitizens. But
the Republican goal Of taking éontrel awayifrom
the federal government is riddled with inaccura-
cies, innuendo and a total lack of regard for the
lessons of history. This is the issue that most
clearly defines the liberals from conservatives.

One of my favorite quotes from Vaclev Havel ’s
Summer Meditations. “If the republics under-
stood the federation to be something that existed
or could exist for their benefit, then they would
have no reason to wish to weaken it, but rather
would want to strenghten it, for in strenghtening
the federation they would be streghtening them-
selves.”

One need only to mention programs and agen-
cies like Medicare, Medicaid, Federal Emer-
gency Management Administration, Social Se-
curity, Clean Water and Air Acts, Environmental
Protection Agency, Centers for Disease Control,
Headstart and the GI Bill to give credence to the
fact that the United States government is indeed
and can be even further, one of the most positive
institutions in the world. One need only to look
at the era of the Great Depression for evidence of
the instrumental role that the federal government
played in bringing the country out ﬁnancial min.

To hand control over to the state governments
would be seriously detrimental to the United will
be that clueles to set such a low limit. Other, more
liberal states - such as New York which has been

traditionally very liberal in welfare distribu-
tion - will set higher limits. The result will
be a mass exodus of welfare recipients to the
state that allows them the highest amount of
welfare for the longest time. The state in
which they move will eventualy be over-
come by a financial crisis and then will have
to resort to cutting families in need of funds,
thus creating another homeless explosion. I
guess the Republicans will feel better know-
ing that the federal government is more
efficient even if it is at the expense of putting
families out on the street just because they
do not possess the skills nor the funds now

Statesfederal gov-
ernment is. . . one

to raise themselves out of poverty. And the
Republicans call themselves the “family
values” party?

I am by no means advocating bureau-
cracy by defending the American federal
government. Liberals, just as much as con-
servatives, hate red tape. But liberals be-
lieve that the federal government has the
ability to be a positive institution by provid-
ing American citizens an equal opportunity
through increased social programs. The
Republicans however, want to decrease the
power of the federal government, and in-'
crease the power and scope of the military
(if you recall my opponent’s column from
last week) while cutting programs like edu-
cational funding. Does that make any sense
to you? It’s a simple choice for me.

Jason Zacher ’98

The Ring-tum Phi Editorial Editor

One of the first debates ourfore-
fathers had when creating our coun-
try was, “How large should our
federal government be?” Being
the wise men that they were, the
federal government (under our cur-
rent constitution) was started as a
small entity given a few speciﬁc
duties. In time, that had to change

with our country’s growth, but-

since this country began, our gov-
ernment has grown at an alarming
rate.

The question that the Republi-
cans have tried to pose is this:
“How can some government bu-
reaucrat know what is best for a
small business owner in Prairie du
Sac, Wisconsin?”

The answer is that the bureau-
crat has no idea. This desk jockey
can barely ﬁnd Wisconsin on the
map and probably only knows the
Packers play football somewhere
in the state. Someone with a prob-
lem from Prairie du Sac becomes a
paper lost in a huge stack on a desk
in Washington. This person has a

needs to be taken care of quickly.
“Your problem will be solved in
due time,” repeats the bureaucrat,
“you’re number 682!” (My favor-
ite Absolut ad is the “Absolut
D.C.,” with the red tape wrapped
around the bottle).

When our country was founded,
the states were supreme. This was
mostly because of the fear of a
strong central government but also
because the states knew their
people best. Today, we need to re-
learn that lesson.

Our government has standards
and regulations that are uniform
throughout the country. What
works in rural Iowa cannot work in
Miami, Florida - the people are
different, their problems are dif-
ferent and their values are differ-
ent. Federal mandates cannot be
universal.

Since taking over Congress in
1994, the Republicans have tried
to place more power in the hands
of the states, a move that President
Clinton has supported from time to
time. They have placed every-

thing from welfare to speed limits
back in the hands of the states.
Since the days of FDR and LBJ,

ernment can solve social ills. Gi-
ant bureaucracies have been built
to do this. To help retirees, we
have Social Security. To help low-
income families, welfare was cre-

ated. In almost every case that the
government is involved, the bu-
reaucracy has grown faster than
could be controlled and now the
size is out of control. These pro-

tions but little planning. Luckily,
the Congress prevented our gov-
ernment from making the same
mistake with our health care sys-
tem.

Some Democrats argue that we
need to provide for people who
cannot provide for themselves.
This is true, but the number of
people who cannot “provide for
themselves” is far smaller than the
government thinks.

There are many areas where the
government can, and needs to, be
large. The government needs to
make safety regulations for air-
planes, cars, etc. It also needs to
regulate our airwaves, and should
even create a national standard to
hold our schools against. But most
of the central decision making
needs to be made in local govern-
ments, where a face can be placed
with that name from Prairie du
Sac, and the worker knows exactly
what the family needs, or could
find out personally and quickly,
not measure against some stat sheet.
That is the true “caring govern-
ment” that the Republicans are,
and the Democrats should be, striv-
ing for.

At least twice every year, the brothers
of Chi Psi can be satiated only with
massive quantities of blood. Yesterday
was one of those days.

On Thursday, October 10, Chi Psi and
the American Red Cross held their first
blood drive of the year. Students and
faculty were invited to come to Doremus
Gym between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. to
donate.

“We really appreciate those who came

out, but we hope to get even more people
next time,” commented Ken Zelenak,
who co-ordinated the event.

Zelenak estimated that approximately
eighty people gave blood yesterday. Al-
though Chi Psi fell short of its goal of
attracting one hundred people to the blood
drive, the number of donors this year was
consistent with the number of donors
from last year.

“It was really great to see all these
people because we were afraid that we
wouldn’t break eighty,” Zelenak stated.

Traditionally, Chi Psi holds two blood

drives every year, one in the fall and
another in the spring. The next blood
drive is scheduled for some time in March.

Zelenak intends to improve on
yesterday’s blood drive. First, the blood
drive will be moved from Thursday to
Tuesday in order to attract athletes who
could not give blood because of weekend
competitions.

Second, the blood drive will be held
later in the day. Zelenak commented that
the number of donors yesterday greatly
increased after three o’clock. The num-
ber of donors became so great that al-

though they stopped taking names at 5
p.m., the last donor did not live until
6:10.

Zelenak hopes that hosting the blood
drive later in the day will allow the blood
drive to take advantage of the afternoon
rush. We understand that people have to
attend classes and lectures,” Zelenak
stated.

Zelenak expressed his gratitude to the
people who helped to set up for the event,
as well as everyone who attended, stat-
ing, “Thanks to everyone who made it
possible.”

The sun is creeping over the Virginian mountains as
the Confederate troops prepare for another day of battle.
The smell of gunpowder is still in the air as the troops
march toward the enemy, the morning dew clinging to
their gray woolen uniforms. No, this isn’t a clip from
the mini—series “North and South,” but our very own
Liberty Hall Volunteers participating in a Civil War re-
enactment.

The Liberty Hall Volunteers, which consists of twenty
Washington and Lee Students and is funded by the
Executive Committee, was founded in 1986 by three
law students who wanted to portray the original Liberty
Hall Volunteers as they had participated in the Civil
War from Manassas in 1861 to Appomattox in 1865.
The Confederate troops affectionately dubbed the en-
listed group of young men from Washington College as
“.lackson’s Pets.” Because the men were well educated
and well disciplined, Jackson favored them by making
them his camp guards. “But they lived down their
reputation because they were often sent into the front

The present day Liberty Hall Volunteers march and
shoot off their weapons in the Homecoming parade and
the Lexington Christmas parade. They also participate
in the ceremony commemorating Robert E. Lee’s death
and travel to at least three or four re-enactments per
year. “We usually go to'Cedar Creek and New Market
every year forre-enactment,” said Sampson. “We camp,
we drill a lot, have morning parades, and re—enact a
major battle based on the tactical history of the battle.
Sometimes we just use period tactics and formulate our
own battle. lt’s actually kind of like paint-ball.”

Like the original Liberty Hall Volunteers of the 18th
and 19th centuries, the 20th century guys have to suffer
in the face of natural disasters. “Last year at Cedar

Oddly enough, the group consists of all Northerners
with the exception of two members. McCorrnack, who
lives in Pennsylvania about forty—five minutes from
Gettysburg, feels that it is not a matter of North versus
South. “Some people who do stuff like this think of it
as a matter of regional pride and heritage, but most
people see at as a matter of American heritage. We’re
not really Confederates or Yankees. We’re not still
fighting the Civil War. I like the way it brings history
alive in a more vivid way. lt’s a unique experience you

The Roots‘ brave new world

David Balsley
Phi Features Editor

It was a far cry from last spn'ng’s
Coolio concert. When the Roots took the
stage at the Pavillion, they gave Wash-
ington and Lee University a sampling of
a sound rarely found in the rap genre.

Last Friday, the Roots shunned the
dance pop beats of Coolio and his west
coast cohorts in preferrence for a slower,
but not less aggressive, east coast style.
Impressively, they performed all oftheir
own background accompaniments, a feat
rarely equalled within today’s rap industry.

Their sound closely paralleled A Tribe
Called Quest’s “Low End Theory,” an
album which gained distinction because
of its laid-back beats and live instrumen-

tation. Currently, this sound makes them
unique; in an industry crowded with rap-
pers who are content to sample the same
tired Parliament funk, the Roots are truly
original. In this sense, the Roots are a
sort of anomaly. They seem to belong in
the late 1980’s “Native Tongue” society,
which consisted primarily of A Tribe
Called Quest, the Jungle Brothers, and
De La Soul. The Roots almost seem to be
behind their time.

Maybe the Roots are aware of their
“antiquity.” At the show on Friday, they
covered a slew of rap’s anthems, includ-
ing the "1978 “up jumped the boogey”
sound of Sugar Hill Gang’s “Rapper’s
Delight.” They also performed parts of
songs by Public Enemy (“Bring the

ell, this week the RC State Theater is getting the

latest grishamroman, The Chamber, starring

Gene Hackman and Chris O’Donnell and di-

rected by Glengarry Glen Ross director James Foley, and the

Michael Douglas/Val Kilmer/scary evil tiger ﬂick, Ghost and

the Darkness. I haven’t seen either, so this week I’m giving

you my recently out on video pick. This will probably be more

useful to most of you anyway, since it’s easier to drink while
you watch a video than a movie in the theater. (Well, it is.)

My first video pick is a movie from earlier this year which
most of you probably missed in the theater. lt’s called Kids in
the Hall Brain Candy, and you should really, really, really,
really, really, really watch it.

Everybody who’s cool knows who the Kids in the Hall are.
Take a second and see if you know. If you don’t, you’re not
cool. Nyah, nyah. Okay, I’ll tell you, and then you can be cool
from the time you finish reading this review on. The Kids in
the Hall were/are (there’s some doubt) a sketch-comedy
troupe from Canada who had their own show on the CBC
which also played on HBO, CBS, and now on Comedy
Central, which we don’t have on our freaking cable because
some jerk at Adelphia Cable thinks we should have TWO
country music video stations and THREE Bible-thumping
moron stations and MSNBC instead. The hottest place in hell
has been reserved for that pinhead exec, but on with the story.
Their show was like

Monty Python meets
“Saturday Night Live?”
in Canada, and, say, both
of them are drunk, and
one thing leads to
another...you get the pic-
ture. It was usually an
eclectic mix of skits fea-
turing the Kids in drag,
makeup, or various states
of undress doing inad-
‘ H_vi'sa_ble: things, an t__ohi—
ilariotusi‘ effect. Though ,. . . g -
the show didn’t feature too many stock characters so that each
line became a catchphrase, you might recognize The Chicken
Lady, Cabbage-Head, Buddy Cole, or their wonderful “The
Gospel According to Dr. Seuss.” Truly, this show was a
landmark in the cultural history of...something. By the way,
the Kids are/were: Dave Foley (now of NBC’s “NewsRadio”),
Norm MacDonald (now of...nothing), Scott Thompson (now
of HBO’s “Larry Sanders”), Mark McKinney (now of “SNL”),
and Bruce McCulloch (check out his CD, Shame-Based Man).

So after the show ended, they decided to make a movie.
What they came up with is sort of Dr. Strangelove meets
Monty Python and the Holy Grail for the nineties. Brain
Candy is about a young, idealistic scientist named Chris
Cooper (Norm MacDonald) who comes up with a brand new
drug which, when taken, invades the patient’s brain and finds
his happiest memory. Then it locks in that happy, pleasurable
feeling and makes him hap-hap-happy all the time. Before
testing can be completed, however, Cooper’s boss, Don
Roritor (Mark McKinney), president and CEO of Roritor
Pharmaceuticals (“The makers of Stummies!”), finds himself
desperately in need of a new drug to boost the company’s
flagging sales. What ensues is a touching, sick fable about the
dangers of medicating one’s problems away, and a startling,
original send—up of our society.

The soundtrack is also a joy, with original songs like
“Some Days lt’s Dark,” “Happiness Pie” (Sample lyric: “See
the sad man in the corner, he is gross and he is old/People steal
his shoes and make him eat mold/His life won’t be bad, if he
does what he is told/He should be an alchemist and turn his
pain into gold...golden pie!”), “l’m Gay,” and “Long Dark
Twenties.”

I hate to say, as some critics have, that unless you liked the
humorofthe show, you probably won’t like the movie. So l’m
not going to say it. Watch it. You’ll like it. Most of the
comedy is not dependent upon references to the show. It
stands alone. Meet lovely new characters like Dr. Cooper,
Don Roritor, Grivo, Cancer Boy, Mrs. Hurdicure, and Wally
Terzinsky. lt’s a twisted take, and not for the faint of heart, but
if you think you’ve got the comedy cojones, give it a try
sometime.

started the day with a bang. Senior quar-
terback Brooks Fischer returned after
missing last week’s game with a shoulder
injury and scored a touchdown on a 17-
yard run to give W&L a quick 7-0 lead.

Despite showing little ability to pass,
the Yellow Jackets began to move the
ball on the ground after the Generals’
TD. But the W&L defense kept R-MC
out of the red zone, stopping the Jackets
once on downs in W&L territory.

Judges hear moot court cases

A panel of three judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for
_ the Fourth Circuit will sit to hear arguments of four cases on

7 Nov. 1, in the Moot Courtroom of the Washington and Lee
: University School of Law.

“The Fourth Circuit visit will be a wonderful educational

':'opportunity for the law students,” said Joan Shaughnessy,
: professor of law and associate dean of the law school. ”The

arguements will give students an opportunity to compare their

K oral advocacy practice training with actual appellate advo-
cacy.
. The four cases, two ofwhich are criminal and two civil, will
be heard in the law school’s Moot Courtroom, beginning at 9
a.m. The court arguments are open to the public.

Author D’Souza speaks on racism

_ . Dinesh D’Souza, author of The End ofRacism, will speak
at Lee Chapel on Oct.'30 at 7 p.m. D’Souza believes that the

- goals of liberal education are lost and freedoms of speech and

thought are imperiled. In his books, he has explored the history,
nature, and future of racism and argues that today’s civil rights

-establishment fuels much of the current American obsesion
‘With race because it has a vested interest in perpetuating black
dependency.

The speech, sponsored by Contact and Young America’s
Foundation, is free and open to the public. There will be a
reception in the University Center’s Fairfax Lounge immedi-
ately following the talk.

Horseman on the Roof at Troubadour

The next presentation of the W&L Film Society will be a tale
of adventure and romance, The Horseman on the Roof (France,
1996), directed by Jean—Paul Rappeneau.

The Horseman on the Roof, reputed to be the bi ggest-bud get
French ﬁlm of all time, was adapted from the novel by Jean
Giono. The story has two main currents. In Provence, in the
1830s, Italian political exhiles are being pursued by Austrian
agents who want to prevent the Italian patriots from returning
to Italy and troubling the Austrian rulers there. Also, at the time
in Provence, an epidemic of cholera rages, killing thousands.
Moving through this doubly dangerous world are a young

Italian revolutionary (Olivier Martinez_)‘_and.v_2i1__y_o_irrig_French M

aristocrat (Juliette Binoche).

Screenings will be at 7:30 p.m. on Friday and Saturday,
Oct. 25 and 26, in the Troubadour Cinema. There is no charge
for admission, through contibutions are welcome. This film is

“ls your room always this clean ?” “What do you usually do on weekends?”

Activities provide entertainment for parents

BY ANDREA EwiNo
PHI STAFF WRITER

_ Everyone run for your lives, your parents and
Siblings are here for the weekend. If this prospect is
one that you will be living for the next three days, you
might want to know what activities will be available this
weekend for “parent sitting.”

Friday morning is parent registration at 9:00 a.m. in
Fairfax Lounge. If you plan to allow your parents to
follow you to class, registration will be open until 5:00
p.m. For adventurous souls, caricature artists, spon-
sored by Student Activities, will be happy to provide a
rendering of your visage beginning at 4:00 p.m.

Several departments will provide parents a chance to
socialize with faculty . The Journalism Department will
be sponsoring an Open House in Reid Hall from 2-4
p.m. Professor Hampden Smith, head of the Journalism
Department, said, “It is an opportunity for students to
show their parents around the lab. We began doing this
last year and we were mobbed. The faculty is looking
forward to the parents coming.”

The Williams School of Commerce, Economics,
and, Politics is also hosting a Reception and Open
House for parents and students Friday afternoon from
3:30-4:30 p.m. ’

‘Later in the evening, President John Elrod and his
wife Mimi will open the doors of Lee House to welcome
Freshmen and their parents. Gaines Hall will welcome
parents of residents with a wine and cheese reception in
the Gatehouse at 4:00 pm.

On Friday afternoon and Saturday morning times

will be provided for parents to meet with professors on
a ore on one basic with in/'IixvI,J....l _,.,.A:..........i am...
provided by each member of the faculty.

Dr. David Novack of the Sociology Department
commented, “We as a department do not provide any-
thing formal for the parents, but each faculty member
provides appointment times to speak with parents.
Parents Weekend provides an opportunity for parents to
visit the institution and meet with individual faculty.”

For parents of students enrolled in chemistry classes,
or parents who wish to relive their college chemistry
class, the chemistry department is holding a seminar at
5:00 p.m. in the new Science Center room A 114. This
will be followed by students’ presentations of summer

R.E. Lee Research Projects in chemistry.
After one survives the chemistry lec-
ture, it is time to experience some culture.
The Theatre Department is presenting is
presenting Dan Tipton’s senior thesis
P7019“, The Importance of Being Ear-
nest Friday night at 9:00 p.m. in the
Johnson Theatre of the Lenfest Center.
If you have late dinner reservations,
another show will be presented Saturday
afternoon and Saturday night, Director
Al Gordon says of the play, “Nowhere in
comic literature is there a play which is
more fun to encounter. It never lags. It
never descends from its high comic and
stylistic tone. It never fails to delight
audiences.”

Saturday begins another full day with
numerous opportunities to bond with your
parents. You can escape to the Blue
Ridge for a picnic and an opportunity to
experience the fall colors with the Par-
ents and Students Day Hike sponsored by
the Outing Club. Anyone who wishes to
attend should call S.R. Evans in advance
at 462-4066. A raincoat, warm sweater,
hiking ‘boots, and an appreciation for
nature is recommended.

On The Hill, the Report of Deans
concerning “Academic and Student Life
at Washington and Lee” will be held in
the Williams School room 237 at 10:00 a.m. Following,

you to Wal-mart and Kroger for a shopping spree, try to
attend the football game Saturday afternoon at 2:00 p.m.
against University of the South. The women’s and
men’s soccer teams will also be competing on Saturday
as well as the volleyball team.

Friday and Saturday, and they will be attending both.”

Professors are looking forward to Parents Weekend
as well. For new philosophy professorlack Wilson, this
will be his first Parents Weekend experience at Wash-
ington and Lee. At previous schools he has attended,
students’ parents did not come to Parents Weekend
much less attend classes; however, he feels this is an
excellent opportunity for parents to see that they are
getting their money’s worth. “It is great that parents get
to see what students are doing. I like Parents Weekend
and I hope parents will participate in class. I’m sure they
will ask questions.”

This years’ Women’s Rush will begin with Rush Registration on
November 3 at 8 p.m. in the Great Hall of the Science Center.

Outlook for Greek Rush
positive despite changes

BY Liz DETTER
PHI STAFF WRITER

“Washingon and Lee is a big Greek
school.” So says the Princeton Review.
Here at W&L, we have one of the largest
Greek scenes in the country, with 65% of
women in sororities and 80% of men in
fraternities. Greek life is an ingrained
part ofW&Ltradition,butthisyearsome
traditions have been changed, and new
ones are being started.

This year, for the first time ever, men’s

Term. “ We’re starting a new tradition of
having Bid Night and Tear Night on the
same day,” said Panhellenic Rush Chair
Laurence Phillips, “I think it will work
out really well.”

Women’s rush has traditionally been
a lengthy process which stretched over
the first week and a halfof January. This
year it has been consolidated into parties
on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and
Friday. Phillips praised the shortened
Rush schedule, “There had been com-

Washington and Lee welcomed 16
new undergraduate faculty members
this fall. W&L always strives to attract
the highest quality professors, and this
group is no exception.

They bring a wide diversity of edu-
cational and professional experiences
to W&L, including two alumni, an
award-winning NBC reporter, and a24
year old planetary geologist. The fol-
lowing received appointments for the
1996-97 school year: Alison Bell (’91),
instructor, department of sociology and
anthropology; Lloyd Dobyns (’57),
visiting professor, department of jour-
nalism and mass communication;
Martha S. Gilmore, duPont ABD Fel-
low, department of geology; Andrew
Grant-Thomas, ABD Fellow, depart-
ment of politics; Jeff A. Hollier, assis-
tant professor, department of psychol-
ogy; Andrew J. Kirkendall, assistant
professor, department of history; Anne
Massey, assistant professor, romance
languages; W. Heame Pardee, assis-
tant professor (part-time), department
of art; Pamela Potter-Hennessey, as-
sistant professor, department of art;
Terry Vosbein, assistant professor, de-
partment of music, and Scott
Williamson, conductor, University

ginning this fall. They are: Marc
Conner, assistant professor, department
of English; Francoise Fregnac-Clave,
assistant professor, department of ro-
mance languages; Jack A. Wilson, as-
sistant professor, department of phi-
losophy; and John W. Tombarge, as-
sistant professor, reference librarian.
Also, Hugh Blackmer has been ap-
pointed to the tenure-track position of
assistant professor, science librarian.
W&L’s reputation as a top-notch
academic institution has not been lost
on the new faculty. “l was interested in
W&L because of its commitment to
undergraduate education,” said Pro-
fessor Conner English. So far, the new
faculty have been generally impressed

with the university. “I’ve been most. ..

impressed by the friendliness of the
students. Everyone is well mannered,”
said Conner.

The Honor Code has also made a
major impression. “I am very pleased
with the honor system, “ said Professor
Wilson of philosophy. “It works well.”

Even the new science center has
made an favorable impression. “lt’s
exactly as it should be,” said Professor
Gilmore of geology. “Everything in
the department is excellent.”

The Board of Trustees passed the “five year plan”
last Saturday, paving the way for Washington and Lee’s
first student commons. “The five year plan is A set of
objectives for the next five years, one of them ‘ieing the
proposed student commons,” President Joi.'i W. Elrod
said.

The idea for the student commons was proposed
over ten years ago and was formally discussed last year
by a committee consisting of members ofthe adminis-
tration, a law school representative and two under-
graduates, Anthony Mazzarelli and Maggie Ogilvie.
“The student commons will serve to dcsocialize the
library,” says Mazzarelli. “ Some of the ideas include
a post office, an ATM, and additional parking.”
Mazzarelli also states, “ The commons will have more
of an impact on the school than any other issue since
I’ve been a student here.”

Other plans for the student commons include student
offices, a food court, a game room, and an improved
exercise facility. “The Gaines exercise facility is often
overcrowded and the weight room in the gym has
similar problems. The new student commons could
also accommodate aerobics classes” said Dean Leroy

“Buddy” Atkins. “We have also considered a theater
which would replace the Troubadour and would be
large enough to accommodate more people,” Atkins
said. The commons would also have a “den” where
students could socialize and relax. Another dining hall,
which would serve upperclass students, might also be
added.

W&L has hired the design consulting firm Dobber,
Craig and Lidsky Associates from Boston to examine
the concept and the program, as well as explore sites for
the structure. The firm will then discuss their findings
with the members of the administration, the faculty and
the Steering Committee for the University Commons.
“This is a very preliminary step but a very necessary
one,” Elrod said. “Once that’s done, we can start
thinking about where we want to build it.”

The Hiller Group, a master planning firm from
Princeton, New Jersey, has recently been hired to look
at possible locations. Elrod says they have an idea of
where they want to build it but a specific location cannot
be divulged until the master planning ﬁrm produces its
findings.

“The ‘University needs a family room,” Elrod said.
“The University has places where all its groups can meet
except a place where everyone can get together as one
does in a family room.” '

l Lenfest debuts Earnest for Parents Weekend Close but no cigar:
BY KELLEY TOTFEN  
PHI STAFF WRITER
in r and the Darkness
'3 Some Washington and Lee students want to show their
community a Wilde time in Lenfest Center.
W&L’s theater department opens its fall season Friday ** of 4 stars;
at 9 p.m. in the Johnson Theater with The Importance of jumbled
1 Being Earnest, by Oscar Wilde.

With its contrived plot and “happily ever after ending,”
the play creates a hysterical farce of Victorian society.
Wilde turns the stage into a circus of dialogue, where what
is said one minute is immediately contradicted the next.

it “Welive in an age of ideals,” one character says in the
first act. Yet the ideals of these characters are just plain
wacky: the young women will only love a man if his name
is Ernest; the mother is delighted that her daughter’s suitor
is ignorant; and a girl’s fictional diary accounts are treated
as reality, simply because they are written down.

“There’s some really snappy little bits of dialogue that
still make me laugh every time I see it, even though l’ve
o been watching it every night for a week,” said lighting
designer Ethan Krupp.

Director A] Gordon chose the play with the help of
senior theater major Dan Tipton, who is completing he
thesis by playing the part of Jack Worthing.

“It is a good play for student actors,” said Gordon. “It
is genuinely funny and different from playing straight,

The pitch:
“It'll be like
Jaws in da
lungle.”

Val Kilmer is an excellent actor. Michael Douglas is not.
So right away, you know that a movie pairing the two is going
to be a bit uneven.

The Ghost and the Darkness is based on a true story about
two lions who killed 130 people over a nine-month period in
1898 whilebeingpursued by abridge engineer, John Patterson
(Val Kilmer) and a professional hunter, Remington (Michael
Douglas). Patterson has been assigned to build the bridge in
Tsavo, east Africa, and so killing the lions and getting on with
the work is his passion. Douglas is motivated by the thrill of
the hunt. .

p.m. in Keller Theater. I

“The students here are multi-talented,” said
director Barry Kolman who will prove his point
when he hands over his baton to junior Emily
Framptonto conduct a song.

Kolman thought Frampton, who took his con-
ducting class last spring, would accentuate the
diverse talents ofthe ensemble. She will conduct
“Victory at Sea” by Richard Rodgers.

“I was a field commander in high school for
two years, so it’s not like conducting in front of
a crowd is new or different,” said Frampton, who
also plays the saxophone in the ensemble. “But
being in front of an audience at W&L is a new
experience for me.”

Greeks prepare for revised Rush

RUSH, from page 1

plaints about [Rush] interfering with
classes. Wewanted to have it before
people got bogged down with work.”

An additional benefit of the short-
ened Rush is less stress for both soror-
ity women and rushees. Phillipsstated,
“Shorter Rush takes the strain ofdeco-
rating for Rush off the sororities so
that they can focus on the rushees.”

Sorority members concur, “Short—
ened Rush takes the focus away from
decorations." said Millie Heatwole, a
junior. This comes asareliefto women
who have spent the beginning ofWin-
ter Term inﬂating balloons and paper-
ing the walls since sororities incep-
tion at W&L.

In Red Square and Davidson Park,
the changes in men s Rush were ini-
tially less well-received. Fraternities
were aprehensive last year when the
administration moved Rush from fall
to winter. Nonetheless, Anthony
Mazzarelli, President ofthe lnter-Fra-
ternity Council commented,“lt seems
like it’s going well. We’re happier
about it than we thought we would be.
We can’t really tell how successful it
is until we get the numbers. If the
numbers are good, I’d say [Winter
Rush] is a success.”

Fraternity members were largely
unwilling to discuss pre—Rush activi-
ties on the record, but those who did
said that they have been getting to
know the freshmen. According to
senior Kevin Alexander, “Freshmen
are invited to most fraternity parties.
There are no guest lists at the door. But
there are some things that are closed
only to brothers.”

Mazzarelli said that freshmen can
get to know fraternities as much as
they like, within certain rules. “There
are no contact rules like the girls.
They hang out all fall, wherever they
want. But they can’t go to fraternity
houses on Tuesdays and Thursdays.”

There has also been discussion of
revising hazing regulations. A forum
was held on Wednesday to discuss a
new approaches toward hazing. Dean
Howison and Mazzarelli hosted the
forum. “Almost all of the fraternities
were represented,” said Mazzarelli,
“We had a really good turnout.”

Rush rules are another part of the
changes that have taken place in both
men’s and women’s Rush.“There used
to be contact rules during [fraternity]
Rush. There usedto be closed contact,

D-C Trip

*Sightseeing

casual contact, and open contact,”
Mazzarelli said. These restrictions
have been nixed to allow more liberal
contact rules.

Panhellenic has also eliminated
some restrictive Rush rules by cutting
down the period of closed contact.
Closed contact rules prohibited non-
academic relationships between
Greeks and rushees. the point being to
prevent dirty rushing. Closed contact
for women began with Rush registra-
tion in October and ended with Bid
Day in January. This year, casual
contact will extend throughout Fall
Term.

Underclass men and women have
already begun to form opinions about
the Greek organizations on campus,
just as fraternity brothers and sorority
sisters check out the prospective rush-
ees. Panhellenic sponsored a pre-
Rush open party for women on Octo-
ber 13. Non-greek and Greek women
mixed, snacked on cookies and lem-
onade, and got to know the Kappa
Deltas visiting from UVA. Phillips
remarked, “It went really well. The
KD s were really excited to be there.
They re enthusiastic about colonizing
at W&L.”

“I thought the Rush party was good
because the freshmen got to meet up-
perclassmen and the KD s from UVA,”
said freshman Sally Moody. l was
able to meet a lot of girls I had not met
before.

Both men and women admit that
they have started to get a feel for the
Greek scene. One freshman male,
who requested anonymity, said, “I do
have some ideas, but I’m nowhere
ready to commit.”

Likewise, freshman Anna Parris
said,“Many ofmyfriends have shared
stereotypes which they ve heard about
each sorority. I hope to meet more
people through Rush mixers. Then I
can form my own opinions about each
sorority and judge which one is for
me.”

The IFC and Panhel encourage
freshmen to begin getting to know
upperclasmen. They remind students
that fraternity registration will be in
mid-November, and sorority registra-
tion is due at the next open party, on
November 3.

The outlook for Rush is positive.
Despite some of the changes to Rush
this year, widespread involvement in
Greek life is one W&L tradition that
should remain intact. After all, we
have a national reputation as one “big
Greek school.”

ﬁve. Junior tailback Seth McKinley
made his first trip of the season into
the end zone two plays later on a one-
yard run.

Holbrook nailed the extra point to
extend the Generals lead to 17-7 at the
start of the fourth quarter.

But with only 6:52 remaining,
Hampden-Sydney’s Dorion Baker
scored for the Tigers on a three-yard
run. Rudzinski’s extra point attempt
went wide, leaving the score at 17-13.

But the Tigers refused to give up.
They forced the Generals to give the
ball up with 4:30 left in the game.
Hampden-Sydney made it to theirown
43-yard line. But juniors Jeff
McKenna and John Benazzi broke up
the Tigers last two pass attempts to
preserve the victory for the Generals.

Washington and Lee had its best
rushing game of the season against the
Tigers, running for 115 yards on 36
carries and picking up two touch-
downs.

McKinley had a season—high 53
yards on 14 carries while sophomore
tailback Floyd Young ran for a career-
high 60 yards on 11 carries.

The Generals’ offensive line of Ed
Zelc-zen, Stefan Neumeister, Will Hill,
Marc Granger, Matt May, John Sens-
ingandfullbackAaron Wilkinsonwere
key in this effort.

This Saturday the Generals are
looking for their second straight win.
Only this time they are hoping to de-
feat the Tigers of the University of the
South.

The Generals will host longtime
rival Sewanee in front of W&L’s moms
and dads. Sewanee has posted a 3-2
record so far this season under first-
year coach John Windham.

Wilkinson believes that the key for
the Generals on Saturday will be in-
creasing the offensive productivity and
playing more consistently.

Water polo finishes season in style

record

humiliated -bysjafn infeqnorqte A

last week to post three straight
victories in the Division III tour-
nament before falling to Johns
Hopkins in the final. The Gen-
erals ﬁnished the year 4-13.

Despite the team’s struggles
this season, head coach Page
Remillard was not surprised by
the water polo squad’s strong
performance last weekend.

“We definitely improved
week by week (this season),”
Remillard said. “That allowed
us to be superior this weekend.

“We ran intc eams we should
beat.”

Remillard emphasized that
the Generals’ tough schedule
was a key factr‘ for the team’s
losses up to la! weekend.

“We were loaded with a Di-
vision I schedule,” he said. “As
soon as we getfin a pool with
people like us, we’ll do better. It
wasn’t for a lag? of trying.”

 

The Generals gave it their all
and then some Saturday morn-
ing as they took out their frustra-
tion against Buffalo State, drub-
bing it 28-6. Senior James
Silberstein picked up seven
points for the Generals and se-
nior Pete Sorensen added six.

Merchant Marine was next
on the Generals’ hit list. W&L
showed no mercy in the Satur-
day afternoon game as it wal-
loped Merchant Marine, 25-9.
Sorensen notched five more
points for the Generals in that
contest. .

The day ended with the Roch-
ester Institute of Technology
squadjumpinginto the pool with
W&L. RIT probably wished it
could have climbed back out as
it succumbed to the charged-up
Generals, 16-10. Silberstein tal-
lied seven points for W&L.

The Generals needed only
one more win to cap a perfect
weekend and grab the tourna-
ment championship, but they had
to settle for second-best as Johns
Hopkins edged them out, 13-10,
in the tourney ﬁnal Sunday. Still,
the Generals had little to apolo-
gize about after their strong sea-
son-ending showing.

“I was extremely impressed

by this team’s leadership,”
Remillard said. He cited the
impressive play of his three se-
nior stars, Sorensen, Silberstein,
and Nathan Hottle, as well as
freshmen Aaron Love and goalie
Ryan Noble. Sorensen earned
first—team all-tournament hon-
ors last weekend, Hottle earned
second-team honors, and
Silberstein, Love, and Noble re-
ceived honorable mentions.

Prior to the Division III tour-
nament, the Generals dropped
consecutive games to archrival
Richmond, losing 9-7 in
Twombly Pool Wednesday, and
falling 11-5 at Richmond Thurs-
day.

In Wednesday’s game, Rich-
mond opened up a3-1 lead in the
first quarter and stretched the
advantage to 7-3 early in the
second quarter.

Just when it appeared Rich-
mond was on the verge of break-
ing things wide open, Sorensen
and Silberstein brought the
crowd and the Generals back
into the game as they each scored
a goal to slice the deficit to 7-5 at
halftime.

Richmond reinstated its four-
point lead by notching a two-
point goal in the third quarter.

But the combo of Sorensen and
Silberstein struck again early in
the fourth, as each scored an-
other goal to make it 9-7. But
that was as close as W&L would
come as UR held onto that same
margin. Silberstein led the team
with four goals and two assists
and Sorensen had two goals and
one assist. Hottle added the
team’s other goal. .

The Generals could not come
quite as close to Richmond the
next night on the road. W&L
hung tough, but dropped an 11-
5 decision.

The water polo team will
graduate only three players this
year. Unfortunately, it is their
top three in Sorensen,
Silberstein, and Hottle, so the
Generals will need to retool with
young talent next season.

“We need to bring in a lot of
freshmen,” Remillard said. “We
need to bring in strong swim-
mers and we need guys who can
play the ﬁeld.”

Despite the loss of his top
three contributors, Remillard
said he was conﬁdent about the
future of W&L water polo.

“We have a very positive at-
titude,” he said. “We’re reload-
ing.”

Generals hold off Tigers

BY BETHANY BAUMAN
PHI SPORTS EDITOR

The Generals held off the
Hampden-Sydney Tigers last
Saturday to clinch their first Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
win of the season.

T h e
game got
off to a
r o u g h
start. On
the sec-
ond play
oftheday,
l i n e -
backer
T r a v i s
Wisdom
sustained a season-endin g ankle
fracture. The senior ends his
impressive career with a team-
high 62 tackles for the season.
Fellow inside linebacker
McGuire Boyd stepped up to
help ﬁll the void, making a ca-

 

reer-high 19 tackles. Junior
David Foster and sophomore
Brad Baker also pitched in, com-
bining for 11 tackles.

Junior fullback Aaron
Wilkinson started off the scor-
ing for Washington and Lee with
a one-yard touchdown run at the
6:38 mark in the first quarter.
Wilkinson’s touchdown, which
was the first of his career, capped
off a 10-play, 58-yard drive
which included 23 and 10-yard
passes from from senior quar-
terback Brooks Fischer to junior
Nick Hodge. Junior Matt
Holbrook added a successful
kick to notch the score to 7-0.

Hampden-Sydney did not
answer until only one minute
remained in the ﬁrst half. The
Tigers converted two fourth
down plays to keep a 14-play,
68-yard march alive. Corey
Morgan ran the ball in from two
yards out for the touchdown.
The score was tied at 7-7 on
Todd Rudzinski’s kick.

With just under a minute left
in the half, the Generals quickly
drove to the Hampden-Sydney
20-yard line, where Holbrook
booted in a 37-yard field goal at
the buzzer, putting the halftime
score at 10-7.

The Generals got some extra
inspiration at halftime when
Wilkinson became the first re-
cipient of the Gary R. Fallon
Memorial Scholarship. The se-
niors from last year’s team cre-
ated the award in memory of
Coach Fallon, who died sud-
denly in April 1995. Patti Fallon,
Coach Fallon’s widow, pre-
sented Wilkinson with the award
during the halftime ceremony.
“It is a great honor,” Wilkinson
said. I

Play resumed and all was
quiet in the third quarter until

Walt Bordurant fumbled the ball
on the Tigers’ 28-yard line. Jun-

Cross Country

On Saturday, October 19,
both the men’s and women’s
cross country teams com-
peted in the Gettysburg Invi-
tational.

The men received another
outstanding individual per-
formance from Jason Callen
en route to their 713th place
finish out of 23 teams.
Callen’s time of 27:18 was
good enough for third place
overall. The women, not to
be outdone by their male
counterparts, took 12th place
in the 25-team field. Carson

Flowers and Natasha Dorofeeva
provided a powerful 1-2 punch
for the Generals.

Volleyball

The Washington and Lee
women’s volleyball team con-
tinued their winning ways with
a pair of victories last week.

On October 15, the Generals
put their 16-match homecourt
winning streak on the line in an
ODAC showdown with Hollins.
The Generals were all business,
dispatching the visitors, 15-7,
15-6, 15-4. Virginia Yoerg led
the way with 11 kills. Hilary

Martin added 7 kills.

The Generals then hit the
road to take on Randolph-
Macon. Yoerg and Nancy
Reinhart each had seven kills
as the Generals won their
ninth straight match, defeat-
ing Randolph-Macon in three
straight games, 15-12, 15-5,
15-9. Martin added a career-
high 10 blocks as the Gener-
als posted a season-high 15
blocks as a team.

With the victory, W&L,
ranked ﬁfth in the NCAA
Division III South rankings,
improved to 22-3 overall and
6-0 in the ODAC.

Soccer teams
compete for top
seeds in ODACs

BY KRis MATHIS
PHI STAFF WRITER

As the men’s and women’s soccer teams enter their ﬁnal
weeks of the season, both teams are vying for top seeds in the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference tournament. Though both
teams have posted strong regular sea-
son records, late season slumps have
proved costly and could prevent each
team from receiving NCAA tournament
bids in mid-November.

The Washington and Lee men’s soc-
cer team bounced back from two tough
defeats to crush Bridgewater Wednes-
day. The Generals scored a season-high
six goals en route to a 6-0 victory.

The offensive attackwasled by Jamie
Parker and Sam Chase with two goals
each. Gordon Meeker and Andy Daters
rounded out the scoring by contributing one goal apiece.
Garry Hill had another outstanding defensive performance at

oalie.
g The Generals’ six-goal performance leaves them just one
goal shy of the W&L record for most goals scored in one
season. The men’s team hopes to break the record when they
host Randolph-Macon this Saturday.

After starting the season with a 7-1 record, which included
a stunning victory over crosstown rival VMI, the men’s soccer
team entered the toughest stretch of their ‘96 schedule by
suffering a disappointing setback to ODAC rival Hampden-
Sydney.

This past week, the competition got even tougher as the
Generals faced the ominous task of traveling to Atlanta to take
on #10-ranked Emory University. Despite being heavy un-
derdogs, W&Lbattled tough throughout. The Generals fought
to knot the game at two goals apiece at the end of regulation
before being stunned shortly into overtime by Emory’s game-
winning goal, 3-2. The Generals bounced back two days later
with a 2-1 victory over the University of the South in Sewanee
to end their trip.

Meanwhile, the women’s soccer team has been busy as
well. But they too find themselves in a late season slump.

The Generals have dropped four out of their last six games
with the latest defeat coming at the hands of Notre Dame
(MD), 3-0. This slump comes after the Generals started the
season with an unprecedented 7-0 run.

The women’s soccer team hoped to turn things around with
a 1-0 victory over Lynchburg last Wednesday. Karin Treese
scored the only goal needed for the Generals as they recorded
their sixth shutout of the year.

‘_‘We’ve had a different attitude in practice this week, and
we are looking forward to kicking butt in our last two games,”
Treese said.

The Generals started the season as unanimous favorites for
the ODAC title and they lived up to these high expectations on
their way to a perfect 7-0 record.

The women’s soccer team now looks ahead to tune-up
games against Feirum on October 24 and Shenandoah on the
26th as they prepare for the ODAC tournament October 30
through ‘November 3.

The men will begin the ODAC tournament with the
quarterfinals on November 5.

“Both teams are optimistic about their chances in the
ODACS,” Parker said. “We have a very good chance of doing
well in the ODAC tournament.”

Both teams are looking forward to strong performances in
the ODACs and berths in the NCAA tournament as the W&L
soccer tradition continues to grow.

Betsy Green ’97

Last Thursday I entered into a
reality I’m not quite ready for. I
ordered my grﬁduation announce-
ments, cap and gown. I guess it’s
official now. I’m really a senior,
and I’m really graduating. If you’re
a senior too, you know how weird
it is.

Beingaseniorchanges yourout-
look on everything. Every little
thing about W&L and Lexington
seem sacred. This feeling will
probably only get worse as June 5
gets closer. Right now, I’m over-
whelmed by the beauty of the Col-
onnade through fog. I love seeing
familiar faces on the hill. By spring
term, I’ll probably feel equal nos-
talgia for the library, Watson Pa-

. vilion and Woods Creek. The pros-

pect of buying a blue book will

Incidentally, how much does it

the real world

suck that we had to pay $28 for our
graduation costumes? Since I
might wear it for a total of four
hours, it hardly seems like a good
investment. In fact, I’m pretty sure
I have the sheer white one Iwore in
high school wadded up in a comer
of my mom’s house. A little black
spray paint, and I’ll be good to go.
Anyway, I have a suggestion. As
soon as the caps and gowns come
in, let’s start wearing them all the
time to class. Relaxing at home.
Not only will we start a hip new
trend, but it will be money well
spent. Who’s with me?

Actually, it’s the time after the
caps and gowns, after the cham-
pagne and sheepskin that I think
freaks us out the most. Being a
student is what l’ve done since I
was six. Now we all have to figure
out something else. Graduate
school, for some us, is no longer a
track to a brilliant career so much
as a way to delay one.

I remember when I was a fresh-
man, I was as certain of my future
plans as any eighteen year-old can

. be in all my shining ignorance.

Now who knows? One thing’s for
sure though —— we seniors are try-
ing to find out. Most of us have
“Job Search” notebooks, and not
only do we have a complete, up-to-
date resume, we have then with us
at all times. You know, just in case
I run into Bill Gates in line at
Harris Teeter, and he wants to of-
fer me a job. Hey, it could happen.

Really, being a senior adds yet
another stress to our lives. While
younger students are complaining,
“I have three midterms, two pa-

lpers, and four meetings to go to

tonight,” seniors will add, “Also, I
have to find a happy, fulfilling, and
lucrative career.”

No wonder all the disgruntled
freshmen make us so angry. They
don’t realize how good they’ve got
it. I wish we could take back out
graduation robes, announcements,
and class rings, but we can’t. It’s
time to forge ahead. But before we
go, let’s enjoy ourtime here while
we still can.

The Pummeling on the Potomac

Decision ’96: Dole VS. Clinton

Week #5: Closing Arguments

Vote for other Democrats so Clinton
can achieve his domestic agenda

Countdown to the
election. . .

4
 DAYS

Since we are simply wrapping up our argu-
ments this week, there is no real issue to discuss.
So, I decided to describe the race as a horse race.

“ Welcome, folks, to the 1 996 PotomacDerby.
Starting in Gate 1 is Clinton, with jockey Al
Gore. In gate 2 is Dole, riden by jockey Jack

,Kemp. . . .

“And they’re off. The candidates round turn
one, Clinton jumps out to the early lead and Dole
is caught up in the pack. Powell suddenly stops
and walks calmly off the track. Buchanan,
Alexander, and Gramm are leading the pack.

“Heading into the back stretch, Dole is pull-
ing away from the pack, and Clinton's lead is
shrinking. Gramm and Buchanan trip and fall,
while Alexander pulls up a little gimpy.

“Clinton pulls slowly away heading into the
final turn. We are in the home stretch, Clinton
leads by about a half mile over Bob .Dole. Dole
tries to make one last sprint, but falls ﬂat on his
face. Clinton slows down and trots across the
finish line. Payment I .'1. ”

On the right again this week isJason Zacher
’98, The Ring-tum Phi Editorial Editor. On the
left will be Laura Knapp ’99, our Democratic
columnist.

“From the Left” discusses the local congres-
sional race and senate race. “From the Right”
focuses on Bill Clinton ’s inability to make deci-
sions in the international arena.

From the Left
Laura Knapp ’99

With less than a week to go until the election,
I think that it is pretty safe to say that Bill Clinton
will not be needing any change of address forms.
So let’s turn our attention to two Congressional
races in which the Democratic candidates are not
ensured victory like Bill Clinton but are indeed
highly worthy of it.

If there was ever a column in which I was
going to receive hate mail, it will be this one.
There is some irony in the fact that I, a professed
liberal and Washington & Lee student (ironic in

itself), am endorsing Mark Warner for Senator »

and Jeff Grey for Congress over W&L graduates
John Warner and Bob Goodlatte. As much as I
am proud of our graduates, serving such es-
teemed positions and giving W&L the national
attention that it deserves, an examination of the
issues in the campaign as well as the records of
both John Warner and Bob Goodlatte will prove
that they are not the best choice for the future of
the nation.

One of the most important issues in this cam-
paign is in regards to higher education. I might
be going out on a limb, but I am guessing that this
is a fairly important issue for a number of W&L
students as well as many students on campuses
around the nation. Both Mark Warner and Jeff
Grey feel very strongly about providing the
opportunity to attend college to every deserving
and able high school student. There are so many
high school graduates in America today that do
not even consider college or any form of higher
education because of the mere fact that they do
not posses the means to pay for it. In an age in
which a college degree and increasingly a gradu-
ate degree is needed for success, it is indeed sad
that these students who obviously worked to
their fullest potential in high school cannot con-
tinue with their studies. Honestly, if such a
system of denying deserving students the oppor-

tunity to attend college, what incentive is
there for them to work in high school? Mark
Warner and Jeff Grey want to prevent such
an occurrence. They both support direct
student loans and tax breaks for college
tuition and vocational training. However,
John Warner and Bob Goodlatte voted to cut
student loans by $10 billion dollars. John
Warner voted against direct student loans
and an innovative career training projects in
the School to Work Act. They want to
deprive students of a chance to increase their
possibilities towards success. How would
you, as a college student, feel if your tuition
payments were to disappear suddenly and
you would have to leaye school? If the
government has the ability to help its citi-
zens in such a positive way - all big govem-
ment complaints aside - then, why shouldn’t
they? This is how Mark Warner and Jeff
Grey feel and, if elected, would carry out a
policy that would protect student loans and
allow high school graduates the opportunity
to attend college.

Another important issue in this campaign
is the topic of Social Security and Medicare.
It is an bipartisan-acknowledged fact that
Social Security and Medicare will have run
our of funds by the time that our generation
reaches the age of 65. Both Mark Warner
and Jeff Grey support measures that will
continue both of these institutions while
John Warner and Bob Goodlatte have voted
to cut $270 billion in Medicare for a $245 tax
break for wealthy Americans. Does this
make any sense? America needs leaders that
support the needs of our senior citizens as
well as taking in account future generations.

Although I should be overly content that
the Democrats are retaking the presidency, I
strongly believe that Mark Warner and Jeff
Grey deserve victory on November 5. Like
President Clinton, they are the best choice
for the future of America -students, seniors
and citizens alike.

America needs leadership, and needs to be a

From the Right
Jason Zacher ’98

The Ring-tum Phi Editorial Editor

In the past four years, America
has seen a dramatic shift in its
foreign policy. Four years ago,
President George Bush provided a
sure-footed, directed foreign
policy. Today, we have Bill
Clinton.

Bill Clinton‘s foreign policy is
afflicted with a typical male dis-
ease, he refuses to stop and ask for
directions when lost. From Bosnia,
to Haiti, to China, the Clinton Ad-
ministration has shown a tremen-
dous lack of direction.

When Bill Clinton was elected,
he claimed that George Bush had
as much of a right to claim he
ended the Cold War as the rooster
had for making the sun come up.
Bill Clinton’s only major foreign
achievement, the Mid-East Peace
process, is much the same way.
Former Secretary of State James
Baker Ill, got the process on its
way toward the “achievements”
that Clinton has taken credit for.

Then there is the rock-solid ne-

gotiating stance our administra-
tion maintains. When North Ko-
rea struggled for a nuclear weapon,
and finally looked as if they were
going to achieve it, Bill Clinton
said that there is no way the North
Korea would be allowed to be-
come a nuclear state. But when

push came to shove, Clinton backed

down, instead telling North Korea
they could basically keep what they
had as long as they do not produce
any more, and threw in a nuclear
reactor to boot. This greatly con-
tributed to an insecure feeling South
Korea and Japan feel,knowing how
trustworthy North Korea is.

Upon his election in 1992,
Clinton told the American people
that China would not have their
Most Favored Nation trading sta-
tus renewed if they could not con-
trol the intellectual pirating and
improve their human rights record.
In a masterful bit of eleventh hour
negotiating, Clinton backed down,
deciding that Most Favored Na-
tion status should not be linked to
these issues.

Clinton will also tell you that he
helped contain Saddam Hussein.
Many analysts feel that Hussein
wanted an administration with little

direction, and wanted to bolster
Clinton’s approval rating. This
also happened right near the Re-
publican convention; good timing
to steal the headlines. Clinton did
make the right decision to bomb
Iraq again, but maybe he should

“Bill Clinton’s

foreign policy is

typical male
disease, he re-
fuses to stop

rections when
lost.”

decide on a meaning for “propor-
tional response.” , '
There- are many other foreign
policy bungles that the Clinton ad-
ministration has participated in, lest
we forget the Japanese trade crisis,
Haiti and Bosnia. His newest bro-

leader in the world

ken promise is when our troops
would be coming home from
Bosnia. Before he sent troops,
Clinton should have seen that peace
cannot be kept in the region with-
out a major power sitting on them
(Tito’s Yugoslavia worked pretty
well). I did not think that our
troops would actually come home
by Christmas, but Clinton should
have never made that promise.

Since it seems like a foregone
conclusion that Clinton will be back
in the White House until the year
2000, we can only hope he switches
his Secretary of State. Lee
Hamilton (D-IN), would be a pre-
fect choice for Secretary of State in
the next administration. I do not
know how any foreign leader can
take Warren Christopher seriously;
he could not negotiate his way out
of a parking ticket.

With the ﬁnal days of the elec-
tion here, the American people need
to decide what is important. One
of the most important things is a
non-partisan, issue: our country‘s
place in the world. In the wake of
the Cold War, the world needs
leadership from the United States.
With our current president, this

leadership is non—existant.

up. Sometimes it seems that the future is creeping up too
fast, and we fear the bureaucracies of the real world. But
above all, we fear the job search, and the long and fright-
ening road of rejection that some encounter. Choosing a
college deﬁnes four years of your life. Choosing a career
deﬁnes your entire life.

W&L offers an excellent alternative to stressing about
ﬁnding a job or internship. The Career Development
Ofﬁce (CDPO) aids students in their job/internship search
in various areas.

“We help students to develop marketing skills, formu-
late a dymamic job search letter, as well as teach them how
to make alumni connections, “ says Beverly Lorig, Direc-
tor of Career Development and Placement.

“We have programs like SLAC (Selective Liberal Arts
Consortium) where students submit their resumes to vari-
ous participating employers across the country.” says
Lorig. There are many other programs similar to SLAC
offered where students can meet the employers face to
face. Mrs. Lorig also encourages students to attend a career
day for minorities at University of Virginia next week.

The CDPO offers help to student of all majors. “If a
student has a speciﬁc place where he or she wants to work,
say, San Fransisco, is an English major, and wants to work

for an advertising ﬁrm, we will do everything we can
to make that fantasy job come true,” say Beverly
Lorig. “Career Development is the happening place

assistance to all W&L students.

on campus. No matter what ﬁeld a student wants to go
into, whether its entertainment, investment banking,
or writing for Vanity Fair, we can help.”

CDPO offers a myriad of strategies for internship
hunting as well. The internship data base, which one
can use without an appointment, is extremely sucessful
in ﬁnding the internship of your dreams. “ Students
applying for internships at W&L are extremely
sucessful in obtaining them,” says Lorig.

CDPO recomends time tables for W&L students at
all stages of the game. The timetables are listed in a
pamphet that students can pick up when they stop by
Career Development. “ We just want everyone to
know that we just don’t offer services to seniors, but
to everyone.”

Freshman should become familar with the CDPO,
use a computerized career guidance sytem, and ex-
plore summer work and internships. Sophomores
should attend presentations about careers, update re-
sumes, and declare a major. Juniors should be think-
ing about contacts with professors in their career
interest area, meet with a member of CDPO to discuss
career goals, and perhaps take either th GRE’s, LSAT’s,
or GMAT’s. Seniors should attend job fairs, request
employment references from professors, and partici-
pate in on-campus interviews.

CDPO offers a “quick question” time every
Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning, and Friday
afternoon, where students can come in without an
appointment to ask any question about formulating
sucessful job or internship search skills or strategy.

To make an appointment with the CDPO to dis-
cuss career goals, call Beverly Lorig or Amy Hartzell

I-House harbors international students

BY WILLIAM OVERBAUGH
PHI STAFF WRITER

A small, white building stands on Lee
Avenue next to University Publications.

Often, if you venture inside at night,
you’ll discover a group of people tasting
Chinese cuisine. On another night, you
may ﬁnd a group watching the news in
Russian. Once in awhile you may even
experience a Patoi Jessen.

What is it that brings these cultures
together under one roof? The Intema-

"itional Club! ‘

-The I-Club, as it is called, seeks to
provide a support group for international
students trying to adjust to the United
States and Washington and Lee Univer-
sity. It also tries to reach out to the
American students who are interested in

The I-House brings multi-cultural events to W&L.

other cultures.

About half of the members are Ameri-
cans, the others representing about twenty
countries.

The club hosts parties and picnics for
members and will have several activities
for the whole school as well.

December 5 will be the “Night
Abroad,” an evening of entertainment
showing different aspects of the cultures
present in the club.

Later in the school year, the club will
organize an “International Folk Dance
Festival,” three weekends of folk danc-
ing from around the world.

So next time you’re on your way
to the post office, glance over your
shoulder and think about what might
be going on inside. On your way

Phi Eta Sigma inductees honored for academics

BY DAVID BALSLEY
PHI FEATURES EDrroR

Every year, Washington and Lee University wel-
comes some of the nation’s most talented students into
its freshman class. Of these freshmen, only the most
proficient are honored with admission into
Phi Eta Sigma.

Last Friday, ﬁfty-six sophomores were inducted into
the Washington and Lee chapter of Phi Eta Sigma. The
requirement for admission into the society was a G.P.A.
of 3.5 or better during the freshman year.

Washington and Lee University’s course catalogue

describes Phi Eta Sigma as “a national honor society for
the recognition of high scholastic attainment among
freshmen.” Phi Eta Sigma was founded in order to
honor freshmen who “demonstrate promise of contin-
ued excellence and scholarship.” Phi Eta Sigma first
appeared at the University of Illinois in 1923 and has
since spread across the United States. The W&L
chapter of Phi Eta Sigma, which was founded in 1937,
is one of over 250 chapters nationwide.

“Whereas Phi Beta Kappa recognizes excellence
over an entire academic career, Phi Eta Sigma inspires
and rewards students early in their academic careers,”
commented Dean Cecile West-Settle, Associate Dean
of the College.

West-Settle, who oversees the W&L chapter of Phi
Eta Sigma, could not attend the ceremony last Friday.
In her absence, Dean Laurent Boetsch, Dean of the
College, conducted the induction ceremony. In accor-
dance with the tradition of inviting one of the university’s
professors to speak at the ceremony, Professor Eduardo
A. Velasquez, Professor of Politics, gave an address
entitled “On the ‘Liberality’ and ‘Artifice’
of Liberal Arts.”

West-Settle points to the society’s limited admission
as testimony of both its high standards and of the
prestige which it contributes to W&L. “The fact that we
have a Phi Eta Sigma chapter here attests to the excel-
lence of our school,” commented West-Settle.

A charming revenge fantasy:

The First
Wives Club

vkarﬁntr of 4
stars;
Chock full
0’ laughs

The pitch:
“It'II be like
She-Devil
without
Roseanne.”

Alex Christensen
Phi Movie Critic

If you have seen She-Devil, a not-bad comedy from the
eighties featuring Roseanne, Ed Begley, Jr., and Meryl
Streep(!), just multiply it by three Roseannes and you will
have the basic idea of what The First Wives Club is like. Both
are equally dark. However, The First Wives Club is also much

funnier, and therefore much more successful. It’s mainly ‘

funnier because it features three great comic actresses. Goldie
Hawn, Diane Keaton, and Bette Midler. Among them, they
have two Oscars (Hawn and Keaton) and four other Oscar
nominations. Nothing to sneeze at.

After a Roy Liechtenstein-inspired credit sequence which
is garish and tacky, there is an extremely weird yet fun set of
scenes from the college graduation of the Diane Keaton,
Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, and Stockard Channing charac-
ters in which all of the characters are played by young
actresses who look like the marquis stars. To make sure they
sound like them as well, the director has had their voices
dubbed by the real actresses. It’s odd to see young versions of
Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton, Bette Midler, and Stockard
Channing, especially when you can see them young them-
selves in Cactus Flower, The Godfather, The Robe, and Grease,
respectively, and the young actresses look nothing like them
then, though they do look like they might be their daughters or
neices or something.

After this, we are updated to the future, where we see that
the four characters, who pledged to be friends for life, have
barely kept in touch at all. The suicide of the Stockard
Channing character precipitates a reunion between the other
three. Hawn has become a successful Hollywood star, Midler
works in a design ﬁrm headed by the wonderful Bronson
Pinchot in his usual role (Funny Accent Guy), and Diane
Keaton is a housewife trying to patch up her marriage. After
Keaton’s marriage fails, the three hatch a plot to get revenge
on their husbands.

The ﬁlm is quite short on plot. You certainly can’t step
backat the end and say, “I never saw that one coming!” You
see them all coming. But the fun is in getting there.

Robert Harling, who wrote Steel Magnolias, wrote the
screenplay from Olivia Goldsmith’s novel, and Paul Rudnick,
the writer of Jeffrey, S isterAct, and/lddams Family Values,
did an uncredited polish on the script. As a result, what might
have been uneven or even stupid with the wrong writer or
actresses becomes jam-packed with laughs, big and little.

The scene where the three ﬁrst wives visit a lesbian bar to
enlist Keaton’s character’s daughter (Jennifer Dundas) in the
plot against the husbands is really hilarious. Goldie Hawn
hasn’t had so much fun in the movies in years.

Diane Keaton is undoubtedly the stand-out in this cast, as
indeed she is in any movie she appears in. Goldie Hawn gives
her best performance since the wonderful Housesitter with
Steve Martin. Hopefully her performance here will be a good
prelude to her upcoming role in Woody Allen’s musical
comedy, Everyone Says I Love You. Bette Midler is perfect
as usual, and Stockard Channing, as sort of the odd-woman
out, nevertheless does an admirable job with her big suicide
scene. Why Stockard Channing doesn’t get more great parts
is beyond comprehension. The supporting cast also includes
Dan Hedaya, Stephen Collins, Marcia Gay Harden, Maggie
Smith, Philip Bosco, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Elizabeth
Berkley (perfect for her part). Watch out for cameos by Olivia
Goldsmith, Ivana Trump, Lea DeLaria, Rob Reiner, Kathie
Lee Gifford, Ed Koch, Heather Locklear, Debra Monk and
Gloria Steinem.

In the ﬁnal analysis, The First Wives Club will not cure the
common cold or solve any of the world’s problems. It doesn’t
even make sense in places. But you’ll also find some of the

Bloom isthe only star ofa one-woman
show portraying the women characters
of Shakespeare. Her show will grace the
Washington and Lee Keller stage on Sat-
urday, November 16 at 8:00 p.m.

Bloom, who made her stage debut at
16 and her Hollywood debut opposite
Charlie Chaplin in Limelight , has spent
her notable career between England and
the U.S. working with such distinguished
stars as Paul Scofield, Richard Burton,
Woody Allen, John Geilgud, and the
Martha Graham Dance Company.

Her show, staged without costumes or

props, showcases her extraordinary gift
for breathing life into some of
Shakespeare’s most fascinating women.
Slipping effortlessly in and out of roles,
Bloom becomes Desdemona, Viola,
Portia, Katherine of Argon, Volumnia,
and Juliet, and at times truly seems to be
talking to, arguing with, beseeching and
berating, loving and loathing all the in-
visible characters aroundher.

“Claire Bloom,” said one reviewer, “is
wise, magical, and spellbinding,” and, added
another, “treats the audience to an staging of
mamy of the Bard’s best loved lines.”

“Jocks, Greeks, Booze, and Violence”-not unoornrnon terms on college
campuses and the title of a speech given by Dr. Joel Fish on October 29th.

The presentation by Student Athlete Mentors addressed the
myths and facts about these groups and their vulnerability to
substance abuse and violence.

Coach Mike Walsh attended a NCAA conference last year at
which Dr. Fish spoke. Fish impressed Coach Walsh, and the SAMs
decided to try to engage him. The mentors received a $500 NCAA
grant which they used to bring Dr. Fish to Washington and Lee.

Fish has previously addressed the National Association of Basketball
Coaches, Temple University and University of Florida on topics including
“Gaining the Mental Edge” and “Stereotypes & Diversity.”

Dr. Fish is a sport psychologist of thirteen years experience. He
has worked with amateur and professional athletes and is currently
a sport psychology consultant for the Philadelphia Phillies, the
Philadelphia 76ers, and the USA Women’s National Soccer Team.
He is also the sport psychologist at St. Paul’s (PA) University and
the Director of The Center For Sport Psychology in Philadelphia.

“I enjoyed the enthusiasm and excitement that Dr. Fish used while giving
his talk,” Noah Egorin a member and elected ofﬁoer of the SAMs stated.

Dr. Fish’s talk is not the only activity of the SAMs this year.
According to Egorin, the SAMs held a picnic earlier this fall to
introduce athletes to their teams and get them involved in SAMs
activities. They also sold t—shirts to raise money for future programs. The
SAMS look forward to a great year with more speakers and projects.

Volleyballteam clinches top seed in ODAC tourney

BY Scorr BOOKWALTER
PHI Sroms EDrroR

Christopher Newport, East-
ern Mennonite and Roanoke
were just a few more brief stops
on the
W & L
volleyball
t e a m ’ s
r i d e
t h r o u g h
the Old
D o m i n -
ion Ath-
letic Con-
f e r e n c e
last week.

T h e
Generals
won all three to improve their
record to a sterling 26-3 overall,
9-0 in the conference, with only

 

one contest remaining before the
ODAC tournament.

W&L began the week with a
Parents Weekend match Satur-
day against Christopher New-
port. The Generals sent the home
crowd away happy with a three-
game demolition of the Lady
Captains, 15-6, 15-6, 15-9.

W&Lcruisedthroughthefirst 1

game and built an 8-1 advantage
in the second game. Christo-
pher Newport then made its lone
run of the match by closing to 9-
6 before the Generals blew away
the young and outmatched Lady
Captains for the sweep. Chris-
topher Newport carries four
sophomores and ten freshmen
on its 16-person roster.

Senior Virginia Yoerg and
junior Hilary Martin led the way
for the Generals Saturday. Yoerg
compiled 14 kills and 3 blocks

  

10 4-13

while Martin had 10 kills and 7
blocks.

The victory.gave W&L its
18th consecutive win in the
Warner Center, dating back to
the end of the 1994 season.

“We’re deﬁnitely comfort-
able at home,” Yoerg said. “We
have an advantage, but not so
much more than other teams.”
She added that Eastern Menno-
nite fans are “just insane.”

The fans were not providing
the only insanity Tuesday night
in Harrisonburg when the Gen-
erals visited Eastern Mennonite,
which had been unbeaten in the
conference. But when the dust
cleared Tuesday, the Generals
were alone at the top of the
ODAC after squeezing past
EMU, 3-2.

“It was pretty important,”
Yoerg said of the victory. “We
just needed to establish ourselves
as the number-one team.”

The insanity began in the ﬁrst
game ofthe evening, a wild 21-
19 marathon which W&L cap-
tured. As exhausting as that ﬁrst
game was, the Generals would
need four more games to put
away the ﬁred—up Eastern Men-
nonite squad.

EMU rebounded with a 15-9
win before W&L eeked out a

15-13 victory in the third game.
But Eastern Mennonite, spurred
on by its rambunctious crowd,
would not succumb easily. It
roared back for a 15-8 win to set
up the deciding ﬁfth game.

With the conference title and
their 11-game winning streak on
the line, the Generals delivered
once again. They came through
for a 15-10 win to escape
Harrisonburg still unbeaten in
the ODAC.

Records shattered every-
where during the long, grueling
match. Freshman Nancy
Reinhart was involved in one as
she set a new school record with
29 kills in the match. Her 28
digs were only one away from
the school record. Junior Alison
Beard also etched her name in
the W&L record books with her
71 assists for the match. Martin
added 19 kills and junior Holly
Thomsen had 13 kills for the
Generals.

Despite the crucial victory
against Eastern Mennonite,
Yoerg said the team still has
room to improve.

“We are not playing as well
as we could’ be right now,” she
said. “Our next two home
matches will help us refocus on

.our goals.”

One of these matches was
Thursday’s contest against
Roanoke. The Maroons prob-
ably thought of less-scary places
to visit on Halloween night than
Lexington after the Generals
drubbed them, 15-8, 15-13, 15-
5, for their 13th straight win
overall and 19th straight at home.

Reinhart had another huge
game with 12 kills and 14 digs.
Martin collected 10 kills and 7
digs, while Yoerg had 8 kills and
6 blocks.

After the Guilford match at 2
p.m. Saturday in the Warner
Center, W&L will prepare for
the ODAC tournament starting
next Friday. The Generals will
deﬁnitely be the targets next
weekend, Yoerg said.

“Everyone is out to beat us,”
she said. “The competition will
be extremely high.”

The volleyball team cannot
worry about receiving an NCAA
bid at the moment because “it’s
out of our hands now,” accord-
ing to Yoerg. But if the team
does not receive a bid, settling
for ODAC champions would not
be such a bad distinction.

“We don’t have any higher
goal than winning the confer-
ence and winning the (ODAC)
tournament.”

Two Generals go for the ball in Saturday’s victory.

Women’s soccer enters postseason play

Men’s team to
finish regular
season play

BY KRIS MATHIS
PHI STAFF WRITER

The 1996 men’s and women’s soccer
teams have had a year of ups and downs.
Both teams started the season on a tear
with the women’s team going an unprec-
edented 7-0 before
losing their first
game, and the
men’s team win-
ning seven of their
first eight matches.
Despite this, both
teams face the
daunting prospect
of being left out of
the most important
tournament of the
year, the NCAA
tournament. This, because, of mid-sea-
son slumps which now leave the men’s
team with a 10-4 record and the women’s
team with a 12-4 record.

The women’s team has rebounded

 

from its problems by winning their last
three games including a 5-0 win at home
over Randolph Macon Women’s Col-
lege on Wednesday in the ﬁrst round of
the ODAC tournament.

Sophomore Karin Treese led the scor-
ing for the Generals with two goals, both
netted in the first half. these goals put
Treese at 18 for the season, and ties her
for the most goals in a season. Co-
captain Michelle Bauman set the record
in 1994.

Sophomore Elizabeth Ritchey added
her one goal for the day and gave the
Generals the 3-0 lead at the half.

Juniors Claire Bowers and Erica
Reineke rounded out the scoring for the
Generals in the second half. Bowers
scored on an assist from Reineke, and
Reineke later netted an unassisted goal to
complete the 5-0 victory.

Goalkeepers freshman Stephanie
McKnight and senior Beth Mozena com-
bined for their ninth shut out of the sea-
son, tying them for a W&L record.

Wednesday’s victory also marked
another record for the Generals. they
now hold the most wins in a season title
with 12.

The Generals will now face Roanoke
College in the ODAC semifinals on Sat-
urday at Randolph-Macon. The hardest
test for the Generals will be in the ﬁnals
should they win their next match. The
number two seeded Generals will most

likely meet numberone seeded Randolph-
Macon coed in the ﬁnals.

R-MC is ranked eighth in the nation.
The Generals are hoping to avenge the 1-
0 Homecoming loss
to the Yellow Jackets.

‘‘In order for us to
have a shot at nation-
als,” said assistant

coach Liz Graham,
“we’re going to have
to face Randolph-
Macon coed and beat
them. They’re a very
good team, but they
make mistakes like
anybody else.”

Going into the
ODAC tournament
W&L gained some
much needed momen-
tum by defeating
Ferrum 4-0 and crush-
ing Shenandoah 6-O.

With these wins,
the Generals ended a
skid in which they had
lost four of their last
six games.

Meanwhile, the
men’s soccer team was looking to end a
skid of their own this past week as they
took on Randolph-Macon and Roanoke
College. The men played host to
Randolph-Macon this past Saturday. De-

 

spite the constant drizzle the generals
survived a defensive battle and came
away with a 2-0 overtime victory. Scor-
ing for the Generals were freshman Jamie
Parker and jun-
ior Gordon
Meeker.

Three days
later, however,
the Generals ran
into a much
tougher oppo-
nent in confer-
ence-leading
Roanoke Col-
lege.

Despite a
solid defensive
efforttheWash-
ington and Lee
men’s soccer
team fell by a
score of 3-1.

The Wash-
ington and Lee
men’s soccer
team looks to
bounce back in
their final

Saturday at the Liberty Hall Fields. They
will begin ODAC tournament play on

Generals hold off late Sewanee rally, 24-21

BY BETHANY BAUMAN
PHI Sroms EDITOR

Your opponent’s mistakes are your opportunities.

The Generals put this lesson to use last Saturday as
they took advantage of five Sewanee turnovers on their
way to a 24-21 victory over the
Tigers.

Things did not look good at the
outset of the Parents Weekend
matchup as Washington and Lee’s
offensive unit lost 14 yards on its
first series and was forced to punt.
But Sewanee’s offense had prob-
lems of its own. On the second
carry of the series, Tiger fullback
Jeremy Whitman fumbled the ball
at the Sewanee 39-yard line. Se-
nior noseguard Neil Kelleter recovered the ball for the
Generals.

W&L looked as if they were going to fail to get a first
down on their second offensive series when senior Jon
Gardner was tackled for a six-yard loss on second-and-
nine, setting up a third-and-long.

 

But then senior quarterback Brooks Fischer con-
nected with sophomore wideout Chas Chastain on a 44-
yard throw. Chastain dashed untouched to the endzone,
giving the Generals theirﬁrst points of the day with only
about six minutes having passed. Junior Matt Holbrook
knocked the PAT through, giving W&L the 7-0 lead.

A second Sewanee fumble set up the Generals next
scoring drive early in the second quarter. Senior safety
Chris Watson recovered the ball at the Tigers’ 12-yard
line. It took the Generals three plays and about 90
seconds to get junior Seth McKinley over the goal line.
He dove in from three yards out, giving the Generals the
13-0 lead. Holbrook’s second successful kick extended
the advantage to 14-0.

Just over a minute and a half had passed before the
Tigers handed the Generals another opportunity. Junior
defensive tackle Omar Moneim snagged the third
Sewanee fumble of the game at the Tigers’ 39-yard line.
Freshman Christian Batcheller, next season’s heir ap-
parent to Fischer’s quarterback position, played the
ensuing series. He completed two passes for 13 yards
and then capped off the drive with an 11-yard run for the
first touchdown of his college career. Holbrook put his
third kick of the day through the posts, notching W&L’s

lead to 21-0 with 7:18 re-

Junior Seth McKinley (24) rushes through the Sewanee defense.

maining in the half.

But the Tigers refused
to be shut out and began a
scoring rally on their last
series of the half. Scott
Matthews pushed into the
end zone on a three-yard
drive. The extra point put
the score at 21-7 going into
halftime.

Sewanee came out
strong in the second half.
They forced the Generals
to punfaftera third and one,
and the Tigers took the ball
at their own 14-yard line.

But on the first play,
Sewanee’sWhitman com-
mitted the fourth Tiger
fumble. Senior linebacker
McGuire Boyd recovered
the ball for W&L at the 14.

The Sewanee defense
stepped up the pressure and
pushed the Generals’ of-

fense back for a three—yard total loss on three plays.
Holbrook salvaged the drive for the Generals with a
successful 34-yard field goal, extending the W&L lead
to 24-7.

Midway through the fourth quarter, Sewanee re-
vived its scoring rally as Micah Elliot found the end
zone on a ﬁve-yard run. On the ensuing kickoff, the
Generals ran into fumble trouble of their own as junior
John Benazzi dropped the ball. Sewanee converted as
Whitman ran the ball in from 18 yards out, putting the
Tigers within three, 24-21.

W&L failed to get a first down on the following
possession and were forced to punt late in the fourth
quarter. But the Generals would not reliquish their lead.
The Tigers were kept from a first down on their final
possession when Boyd and Kelleter combined to stop a
Whitman run. The Generals ran out the clock to clinch
the 24-21 victory.

Fischer finished the game with 143 yards on nine
passes, putting him within 135 yards of becoming the
W&L all-time leading passer. “

McKinley also moved up in the Generals’ record
books. He ran for 52 yards on 13 carries last Saturday.
He has logged 1,313 yards rushing, placing him in the
number-eight spot on W&L’s all—time rushing list. This
is a considerable feat for McKinley, who has missed
many games due to injury. '

Also notable in Saturday’s game was the perfor-
mance of the defense. With senior Travis Wisdom out
for the season with an ankle fracture and senior Peyton
Williams out indeﬁnitely with a shoulder injury, the
strength of the d- line was questionable going into
Saturday’s game.

But freshman Scott King stepped in for Williams,
making ﬁve tackles, two for losses. Junior David Foster
and sophomore Brad Baker ﬁlled in for Wisdom at
linebacker, combining for 12 tackles, including two for
losses.

Tomorrow the Generals will travel to Bridgewater
College for an important ODAC matchup. Bridgewater
has been the surprise of of the conference. Coming into
the season, the Eagles were carrying a 24-game winless
streak. But this season, they have managed to post a 4-
3 record, 2-] in the ODAC. The Generals have won the
last three games in their series with Bridgewater.

Center Stefan Neumeister commented, “We will
win...if we continue to do what we have done all season
and that is play smart and capitalize when we have the
chance...We will also need to continue to step up the
running game and take the breaks to our advantage.”

WHO'S WHO HONORS SENIORS:

Who ’s Who/lmong Students inAmerican Universities and
Colleges selected 35 W&L senior undergrads and 12 third-
year law students to appear in its 1997 edition. The 57 students
join the ranks of scholars from 1900 colleges and universities
around the world. Members of the university community
nominate students for Who ’s Who based on academic achieve-
ment, community service, extracurricular leadership and fu-
ture potential.

FILM EXPLORES VIOLENCE:

The W&L Film Society will treat Troubadour patrons to
Once Were Warriors, a story of domestic and cultural violence
in New Zealand. The ﬁlm’s title is double-edged. On the one
hand, it reflects a renaissance of Maori pride and self-asser-
tion. In the film, though, it symbolizes the debasement of
warrior values into stupid macho cliches arising from power-
lessness and disenfranchisement, not strenth. The ﬁlm focuses
on the experiences of one family, and is directed by Lee
Tamahori.

Showings are on Friday, November 8 and Saturday, No-
vember 9 at 7:30 p.m. Admission is free of charge, but
contributions are welcomed.

ANDERSON GIVES LECTURE:

Students of economics will enjoy “The International Trad-
ing Order: How Open and Who Gets Hurt?” on November 13
at 7:00 p.m. The Class of ’62 Fellowship Lecture will be given
by Michael A. Anderson, associate professor of economics at
W&L. The public is invited to attend the lecture in Northen

WASHINGTON & LEE UNIVERSITY

Faculty recognized hazing
problem, reevaluates policy

BY Liz DETTER
PHI STAFF WRITER

Why does the momentum to do something about
hazing come from a New York Times article ratherthan
from student complaints?” Sophomore Elizabeth Huston
voiced the question that has been on everyone’s mind
these last few days.

The answer to this question is that it has not. The
Student Affairs Committee voted, last Wednesday, to
approve a new policy on hazing, the culmination of
events which began last December.

According to President Elrod, he first learned of the
hazing problem last year. “I had not directly encoun-
tered a hazing problem at Washington and Lee until I
began receiving anonymous letters and phone calls
from parents and students. Every conversation in-
formed me of hazing incidents that were going on last
year. They were all telling me the same story, which
lent credibility to the reports.”

Elrod responded by infomiing the Board of Trustees.
He also met with the presidents and pledge educators of
all ﬁfteen fraternities. The fraternities were told that
hazing is both dishonorable and illegal and that the
University intended to erradicate it.

At the request of the Trustees, the President of the
Executive Committee, President of the Interfraternity
Council, the Dean of Students, the Associate Dean of
Students for Greek Life and a member of the Board of
Trustees began work on a plan to eliminate hazing. As
part of this comprehensive plan, the Student Affairs
Committee designed a new University policy on haz-
ing. -

Under the new plan, which was approved last
Wednesday by a vote of 9 for, 2 against, and 1 abstain-
ing, individuals will be held responsible for hazing.

“Instead of going after the institution, we will go
afterthe persons in the fraternity who haze. Forthe ones
who encourage it, the penalty will be suspension or
possibly dismissal,” said Buddy Atkins, the Associate

Dean of Students for Greek Life.

Atkins expressed disgust with hazing, and empha-
sized that the University is implementing a plan, rather
than a policy, to combat hazing. “It’s a major problem
for this University,” he said. “We can’t just improve by
modest degrees; we need to get rid of it. It not only
weakens the University, it weakens the Honor System,
and it weakens the fraternities.”

As part of the comprehensive plan, President Elrod
intends to involve parents, faculty, and students. In his
Parent’s Weekend address, he stated, “Our number one
concern is hazing.”

l’ve talked to the parents of our students over Parents
Weekend, and I intend to write them a letter,” Elrod
commented Tuesday. “I am going to write to the parents
of every freshman male and the parents of every frater-
nity male, and I’m goingto ask them to help us erradicate
this problem however we can.”

Part of the new plan includes redesigning the
pledgeship program to eliminate any form of hazing. “I
think that if the new program was structured and de-
manding, within the limits of the new policy, then it
could be just as effective,” said a senior "fraternity
member.

Under the new plan, students and faculty could
report incidents of hazing. Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent Anthony Mazzarelli explained, “The new Univer-
sity hazing policy allows for various different types of
input which would lead to investigations, but at the
same time, it protects fratemites because action will
only be taken if evidence is found.” ,

Certainly the awareness of hazing has been height-
ened by the recent article in the New York Times. This
may lead to increased cooperation with the new policy.
After a faculty meeting Monday night, which was
called to discuss the recent article, faculty all over
campus began to question their students about Greek
life.

November 4 marked the day that stu-
dents began seeing orange ﬂyers pro-
claiming that soon, you too, could have
Ethernet in your dorm.

No, these aren’t advertisements for
pharmaceuticals that you can have deliv-
ered to your room; rather, it is a major
step by University Computing (fondly
known as UC by the people who work
there) and the newly formed Student
Networking Cooperative (SNC) to up-
grade student’s personal connections to
the lntemet.

Ethernet provides a fast and reliable
connection to the campus network, and it
allows for the use of more advanced
networking applications. However, for
most people, the greatest advantage of
Ethernet will be never having to see the
“All data queues full” message ﬂash
across their screen again, since with

thecampus network andthe resources of
the lnternet,” said Cliff Woolley, a found-
ing member of the SNC. “Students should
ﬁnd that the speed of the Ethernet com-
pared with the speed of the data phones is
more conducive to heavy usage, and they
will no longer have to wait in line for
online time.”

Currently, Ethernet is available on a
first-come, ﬁrst-serve basis because there
are alimited number of ports available.
In the smaller dorms there are 24 connec-
tions available, and in the larger, such as
Gaines and Graham—Lees, there are 24
per wing.

Although not everybody is going to
get connected in this round of upgrades,
UC and the SNC have plans to eventually
bring every room this type of connection.

This will not mean, however, that
students without Ethernet will not be
able to get their e-mail from their dorm
room, and, as of right now, there are no
plans to get rid of the current Rolm termi-
nal interface.

 

Ifyou are one ofthe lucky few who is
able to get a slot, the SNC and UC is
requiring that students who plan on using
the connection to take a one-time course
before they get their IP (Internet Proto-
col) Address, a set of numbers that is
needed for everything to work.

These classes will be taught by the
University Computn’ HelpDesk staff and
other students who have been taught by
the members of the SNC.

For a school so proud of maintaining a long-
standing tradition of honor, the recent focus of atten-
tion on poor student conduct is unusual. While the
subject of hazing has been brought into the spotlight,
another conduct violation, vandalism, is also being
highlighted. In the past two weeks, eight sophomore
males have been convicted for vandalism by the
Student Conduct Committee (SCC).

On October 29, the SCC brought charges against
three sophomore males involved in vandalism in the
dorms. According to SCC President Robert
Covington, the incident caused minimal damage and
was accidental in nature. One student was sentenced
to payment of 150% of the cost of damages, and all
three students are required to write a letter of apology
to the dormitory hall involved. “Additionally, the
students were placed on conduct probation because
we felt that drunkenness was no excuse for this act

broken by vandals last week.

even if it was unintentional,” said Covington.

The vandelism, however, not only damaged prop-
erty, but also endangered students’ safety. Two
students were standing below the window when it
broke. “When [my friend] heard the glass break, he
pushed me under the eve,” said a freshman female
who witnessed the act of vandelism. “He looked up
and glass fell in his eye.”

Security drove the couple to the emergency room,
and the doctor “scrapped a tiny sliver of glass off his
eyelid.”

The followingweek,chargeswere brought against
four more students in two SCC hearings on Novem-
ber 5. The SCC found another sophomore male
guilty of vandalism and imposed the same sentence
as the previous cases. In addition, four sophomore
males were found guilty in regard to a vandalism
incident at a fraternity house.

The students invloved with this incident were
required to write a letter of apology to the house-
mother and Buildings and Grounds, pay 150% of the
cost of damages, and were put on social probation for
the remainder of the academic year. In addition, one
student must complete 15 hours of community ser-
vice by the end of the Winter term and the other three
students must each serve 10 hours.

Associate Director of Buildings and Grounds
Randolph Hare says that vandalism concerning uni-
versity housing has always occurred. “Historically
there are always problems with vandalism,” he said.
“From our standpoint, there has not been a signifi-
cant increase, but to the credit of the SCC, there has
been greater awareness and stricter. enforcement of
penalties.”

According to Hare, the new “scheme” this year
seems to be water balloon slingshots targeted at
windows. Director of Security Michael Young be-
lie'ves that vandalism is usually motivated by intoxi-
cation rather than a desire to cause damage. “Van-
dalism here is not a large problem compared to other
places that I have been,” said Young.

The SCC, however, is taking every case seriously.

Charlie McDowell did it differently. And, as Robert
Frost surmised, that has made all the difference in the
world.

“He did it because he could,” said former CBS
newsman and colleague Roger Mudd. “He had the
talent, the eye and the sense of the absurd.”

On Tuesday, McDowell, the 47-year veteran of the
Richmond Times-Dispatch, was given the National
Press Club’s highest accolade, the Fourth Estate Award.
Recognizing careers that have embodied the profession ’s
highest standards, the award has previously been given
to such notable figures as Walter Cronkite, Helen Tho-
mas, David Brinkley and James Reston.

Citing his “incisive thinking and graceful writing
about government and politics,” the Press Club’s Board
of Governors wish to celebrate McDowell’s success as
a Washington correspondent.

McDowell graduated from W&L in 1948 and then
went to the Times—Dispatch the next year as a features
reporter. Editors soon realized his journalistic talent
and moved him to their Washington bureau. He became
tlge paper’s first full-time Washington correspondent in
1 65.

Accordingto Mudd, what separated McDowell from
the rest of the pack was his sense ofthe offbeat and his
ability to deliver the news in a fresh perspective. Essen-
tially, he offered the reader a break from the monotony
of the “who-what-when-where-how” style of journal-
ism that had plagued the pages of the Times—Dispatch
since its inception.

Mudd recalls one of the first stories McDowell ever
covered. The grounds surrounding the capitol building
in Richmond had been invaded by legions of squirrels.
Frustrated with their presence, the governor ordered his
Buildings and Grounds crew to get rid of the annoying

Life on the Hill
I C. E. Miller ’98

The black and white photo-
graphs make me nauseous, the cap-
tions curdle my stomach. So stark,
so revolting. Then the realization
that this isn’t happening to some-
one else, someplace else. This is
Washington and Lee University.

We made The New York Times
this last Sunday, and unlike being
at the top of US News and World
Report, this isn’t something I plan
on sharing with the world. I don’t
think Mom and Dad want to ac-
knowledge that boys I know be-
lieve that pain and humiliation is
the only way to ensure loyalty and
unification. And that those same
boys will pay the price, financially
and physically, just to belong.

I’m starting my third year at this
University. I don’t have any re-
grets. I don’t wish I were some-
place else. Because of that there is
no way I can claim ignorance or
surprise at the hazing pictures dis-
played in The Times this Sunday.

Many of my friends have shared

“They tell us
we're smart
kids,
America’s
best and
brightest. ”

similar stories with me, but they

were just stories. ‘You can’t avoid}...
these pictures. You can-’targue with .

them. Sometimes, the truth is very
hard to see. But these pictures show
thingsvery clearly. Some of the
acts depicted aren’t about brother-
hood and bonding. They are hu-
man beings being treated like ani-
mals.

It seems these are tactics to break
men down, not bring them closer
together. These practices are ar-
chaic, animalistic something to feel
shame about as a university, as a
fraternity as an individual.

I have heard so many different
reactions this week, so many boys
laughing about it, so many of my

friends recoiling with disgust to
the actual photographs, angry pro-
fessors who sit on both sides of the
fence of tradition.

It seems a lot of people want
answers and solutions, and some
want the situation to be ignored. I
don’t know if there is an answer, if
there is a person, an organization
to blame. It would seem we all
share in this responsibility.

Perhaps the blame falls on the
administration. The deans that run
this university know all about the
underbelly of this campus. The
photographs hold no surprises, just
truth. The current hazing policies
rely on reporting the instance of
hazing that occurred. The conse-
quences ofthis to an individual are
extreme. Alienation by his peers,
and brothers is almost sure to oc-
cur. lts hard to keep secrets on a
campus this small.

The fraternities themselves must

also be responsible. To single out A

a house, or blame a particular per-
son is impossible. Each is respon-
sible, on the local level, on the
national level. I was told once of a
pledge, who after tear night, was
decided by the brethren to be “un-
worthy” of initiation. In order to
get the pledge to drop out he was
specifically targeted for hazing
practices more severe than that of
his other pledge brothers. This is
one group inﬂicting pain and hu-
miliation on one individual for no
other reason than dislike.

There it is again the need, to
belong, to fit in, to be recognized
as a part of a “group.” This is an
especially great problem on this
campus. We need to hold ourselves
responsible for that. The student
body is homogeneous and ex-
tremely hostile toward people with
perceived differences. I’ll admit
l’ve been guilty of judging a per-

son onrumors, on what they were ,
:wea‘ring,~or'_even for a comment

made in class. I’m not nice to ev-
eryone, and I don’t like everyone,
but I do believe in respect. I can
respect a person for his individual-
ity. That on this campus takes cour-
age.

We’ve all seen it, we’ve all
spread the rumors about broken
bones, branding, boys in the hospi-
tal for alcohol poisoning. They tell
us we are smart kids, America’s
best and brightest. What happened
to our compassion, our intelligence
to question orders, to once in a
while ﬁght tradition, just think for

ourselves and not en mass?

AT The Gap in lliemali.

The bureaucracy is everywhere

GreenLand
Betsy Green ’97

What an exciting week it’s been.
Winter Term registration and the
election have certainly kept me
occupied. It is these two activities
that inspired me to make this
week’s column Betsy’s Salute to
Bureaucracy.

Course registration has become
ridiculous. One of the reasons a
small school appealed to me was
that I thought life would be much
easier. In a small school, I rea-
soned, I’d be able to talk to my
professors whenever I wanted, find
the library books I needed, and not
have to stand in line and put up
with hours of frustration to get the
classes I want. Two out of three
isn’t bad, but it could certainly be
better.

On Monday, chaos reined. A
line stretched out of Karen Lyle’s
office and down the stairs. Dan
Odenwald went to four different
buildings trying to figure out where
to get a signature for a literature in
translation class. Allison Simmons
stood in line at4:50in the morning
and barely got into the history class
she wanted. I myself chose one of
my classes for the sole reason that
permission was not required to take
it. And it’s not over yet. I’ll see
you bright and early in the morn-
ing on Monday, January 6 to sign
up for P.E. classes.

It’s time to stop the madness.

We absolutely need to simplify

 
 

this whole stupid registration pro-
cess. Every department has a dif-
ferent policy right now. Wouldn’t
it be easier if all of them worked
the same way’? At least then we’d
know what to expect and could
plan our attack plans accordingly.

As for the popular classes we all
get up early and stand in line for.
maybe the departments could in-
formally survey students to deter-
minealevelofinterest. Ifit’s high,
more sections could be taught. Or
professors could get sneaky. We’d
all love to take that one hour a
week, professor give free dough-
nuts, show up and get an A class...
but woulditbe so popularifit were
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
at 8am?

And can anyone think of any
earthly reason for PE. registration
to take place two months after ev-
erything else? I can’t, although
I’m willing to be The Phi will get a
letter within the next week ex-
plaining this phenomenon. I wel-
come it I’d love to know the rea-
son. It’ll give me something to
think about while I pitch my tent
outside the gym at 2 in the morning
this January. Okay, now I’m rant-
ing. I’ll admit that. But it’s time
we made some changes around
here.

My other big event this week
was voting in my first presidential
election. I got up on Tuesday
morning and walked to City Hall
(I’m registered in Virginia) feel-
ing like a good citizen, excited to
be a part of the process.

Voting really is pretty neat. It

beats standing in line for history
class any day. After all of MTV’s
Rock The Vote hype, I half ex-
pected Kurt Loder to be waiting at
the polls to shake my hand. The
volunteers at the polls were, to put
it delicately, not of the MTV gen-
eration. They may well have voted
for Bob Dole because he seems

“After all of
MTV’s ‘Rock
The Vote’ hype,
I hay‘ expected
Kurt Loder to

like a nice young man (by the way,
for the humor impaired, I honestly
respect and applaud the people who
volunteer to work the polls and
probably get no more than a cup of
coffee and a button in return for
their time and I’m only kidding so
relax already).

Anyway, I went to the lovely
volunteer and told her I was Eliza-
beth Greenland gave her my ad-
dress. She and the woman next to
herbegan flipping though volumes
of pages. She said, “Could I have
your full name please?” So I told
her I was “Elizabeth Ann Green.”

g .,»'0nce-Youvaiemitiatedlintothevfrateunty y ,
‘  havejthe iigiirto makegfttyxvhatl on ' ‘

Perhaps in case there are two people
named Elizabeth Green that live in
my apartment. She yelled,
“ELIZABETH ANN GREEN,”
and the woman next to her made a
mark on her volume of paper.
She then handed me an index
card on which was written the word

“Vote” and I moved on to the next
point, having no idea what to do

with the card, still a little bit taken
aback by having her yell my name
like that, like my mom did when I
was little and she was angry at me.
Oh, sorry. Ranting again.

The next volunteer, standing
about two feet away, took my little
index card. A fine system they
have there. Did they really need
the index card? Couldn’t the lady
at the table have vouched for me?
I’d have said, “Yes, I’m the Eliza-
beth they werejust yelling about.”
Also, I have a whole stack of index
cards at home, I could start hand-
ing them to random people, so
they could vote more... I could get
Mark Warner elected yet!

The booth itself was exciting
for me too. It’s weird to think I’m
doing my duty as a citizen, making
things happen in America in an
area smaller than my shower. The
ballots I was used to in Illinois
were the ones you punch holes in.
Here there are levers you move to
select your candidate—it’s like a
big toy. When you pull the lever to
open the curtain again, all of the
levers move back to neutral. It’s
really hard to believe you’ve done
anything at all. I think it’s all a big
sham, designed to sell index cards.

W&L students destined for Oxford

BY B. J. WALKER
PHI STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee provides many unique opportu-
nities to undergrads. Perhaps the most prestigious is the

Oxford exchange program.

Each year a committee chaired by professor Leonard
Jarrard of Psychology selects one sophomore to spend
their junior year studying at University College at
Oxford University. The application process involves
two recommendations, and essay, and interview. The
committee evaluates those who have applied on a vari-
ety of criteria: intellectual curiosity, ﬂuency in speak-
ing and writing, diligence, and ability to complete W&L
graduation requirements by their senior year.

“Each year about six or seven people apply,” said
Jarrard, but only one can be chosen. The program
originated as an exchange program for faculty. Set up
by Jarrard and then President Huntly, the original pro-
gram allowed W&L faculty member to spend a year in
Oxford. The program was expanded to include students

several years ago by professor emeritus William Watt.

It is speciﬁcally designed for a third year W&L student.

The object of the game is to own Lexing-

The Lexington Sunrise Rotary Club cre-
ated the game, “Wheeler Dealer,” under the
premise of the board game “Monopoly.”

There is no Boardwalk or Park Place
equivalent, but players can purchase local
businesses, doctors’ and dentists’ offices,
Lee Chapel, Virginia Military Institute and
other Lexington landmarks.

Local shops and Rotary members will
sell the game, due out in December, for $10.

Half of the proceeds will benefit child-
hood disease prevention, dental care, and
teen pregnancy prevention in the county.

The remaining funds will go to Rotary‘

International, which serves humanitarian

charities.

“We had a presentation from a local
community health official who said there
are lots of things they could be doing, but
that they just don’t have the money,” said
organizer Lori Sadler.

“We say this as a great way to help those
programs.”

The game has had a great response from
the community, Sadler said, and there are
only ten spaces left. Corner spots on the
board sell for $500 and the other spaces sell
for $250.

Companies are purchasing spots as a
way to combine advertising expenses with
a charitable donation, Sadler said.

The club is hoping to sell 1,000 games,
creating a profit of $10,000.

“They’d be great gifts for any occasion,”
said Sadler,. “I think it’sjust a great souve-
nir of Lexington.”

There is a college graduate
among the students this year
at Washington and Lee
University. '

Guy Molyneux is an ex-
change student participatingin
the Oxford Exchange Program.

He heralds from a small
farmhouse five miles from
Worcester, England, and has
earned a geology degree (a 2-
1 specifically) from Oxford
University.

“A comparison between the
two schools is really difficult
to assess,” said Guy.

“At Oxford, the exam sys-
tem is slightly different. I

son they send over here is usually a recent graduate,”

While at Oxford, those selected are considered full
members of the University. Students are assigned the
same tutors and live in the same housing as the
British students.

“The place I lived was cold and tiny,” said Bunny
Wong, last year’s representative. “But the people are

Oxford’s sports teams are also open to the W&L
students. “I was on the rowing team,” said Wong. ‘‘It
was really fun.”

One W&L student became somewhat of a hero four
years ago. A member of W&L’s women’s soccer team
was selected and played on the Oxford team. In the
game against their arch-rival, Cambridge, she scored
the winning goal.

“I think they were glad she was there,” said Jarrard.

The unique Oxford schedule allows students the
time to explore Britain and Europe. Classes start in
October and continue until June. The academic year is
divided into three eight week class periods with five
week breaks in between.

energy in the foreseeable future, whether Keanu signs for the
sequel or not. He’s murdered by the fella Charlie was sup-
posed to hit before her amnesia, code name Daedalus, who is
really Dr. Peters of last year’s Twelve Monkeys. He’s joined
forces with The Chapter so they can keep getting their fund-
ing, and he works with the father of Davis’s mystery daughter,
' who is played by Jean-Claude Van Damme, who apparently
has been working hard on getting rid of his accent. Nice work,

Jean-Claude_. .
So now, In addition to trying to save the world and kill

people, Davis has to foil the big plan to stage a terrorist attack
so The Chapter can keep its funding, and save her daughter
who has been kidnapped by Jean-Claude Van Damme. Any-
body wanna take bets if she can do it, especially with Jules
Winnfield as backup?

The whole movie is basically a backdrop for screenwriter
Shane Black and director Renny Harlin’s grand, brutal wet
dream of brutalizing women and then looking lovingly at the
scars inflicted. Geena Davis plays right along, staring myste-
riously at her bruises in big mirrors and saying, “Sometimes
I stand and stare at my scars and wonder where they came
from.” If you don’t puke, you might be Renny Harlin or a
fourteen-year-old ADD-afflicted, Mortal Kombat-addicted
slackjaw with just maybe one too many porn magazines under
your mattress. Lots of children get threatened with guns and
bombs, as well, so if you think that sounds like fun, this
winner’s for you, too.

To sum up, people may tell you that there’s some good
dialogue (there is, but only about eight lines’ worth, and it’s
so spread out and disconnected that you look at your watch‘
waiting for one, or, like, a big explosion), and some people
might tell you there’s some good action (there’s about ﬁve
minutes’ worth an hour and fifteen minutes in), but overall,
this is the worst movie of the year, worse even than The Crow:
City of Angels, and that's saying a mouthful.

“Around Christmas time”

you have to decide between
jobs, grad schools, and pre-
pare for the exams.

“There aren’t many exchange
programs, and it seemed it
would provide me with an
interesting year.”

Unlike W&L, Oxford is not
a “liberal arts” institution, so
without “gen—eds” to worry
about a degree would be far
more intense in a certain
subject.

How work is given out is
also very different.

“I attended lectures about
fifteen hours a week for geol-
ogy.

“Ithen wenttoatutorialfor

one to two hours, where I was
given reading assignments and
a paper of about five to eight
pages for each week.

“The tutorials are one or
two students and a tutor, so
they are pretty intense.

“At Oxford you get all your
work in one fell swoop instead
of a trickle, so there is quite a
lot of pressure.”

There are no fraternities at
Oxford, but there are not too
many social differences.

“ Oxford is cliquey, but it is
not an organized cliquishness
as opposed to fraternities.”

And as for drinking?

“Well, we have a college

the States before. He has vis-

ited many sites of interest in the
West, such as the Grand Canyon
and Death Valley.

He also visited quite a few
cities, including Cincinnati
and New Orleans last summer.

.As for plans after W&L, “I
want to see more of America.
I'd really like to drive coast to
coast, then probably go to grad
school back in England.
“That’s more probable than a
job. Most jobs require a de-
gree, as in the United States.”

Guy expressed his pleasure
with Washington and Lee
University.

‘‘I’m really enjoying it
here, and would recommend it
to almost anybody.

‘‘I think travel is an important
thing.”

W&L’s landmark receives
1.5 million for renovations

BY KATHERINE MAYURNIK
PHI STAFF WRITER

Lee Chapel, “the Shrine of the South,” will undergo an
estimated 1.5 million dollar renovation within the next
year, thanks to an anonymous 1 million dollar donation and
a matching grant from class of 1941 alum Jack Warner.
Another 1 million dollar endowment and alumni support
will maintain the chapel’s continuing operation.

Other than a project to improve the air conditioning
system, the renovation will be limited to the museum in the
chapel basement. In order to preserve the University’s
valuable painting collection, a sophisticated cooling sys-
tem will be installed to closely control the temperature and
humidity. The museum collection includes the Peale
portrait of George Washington, the Pine Portrait of Robert
E. Lee, and the Washington/Custis/Lee Collection.

According to Thomas V. Litzenburg Jr. ’57, director of
the Reeves Center and a former editor of the Ring Tum Phi,
the paintings underwent restoration in the late 1960’s and
the early ]970’s, and although they are presently in good
condition, the new system will preserve them more effec-
tivel .

“Our highest priority is to create a museum level quality
environment for the University’s greatest treasures,” says
Litzenburg. “A lot of money spent on the project won’t be
seen, as we take on the critical task of improving the
environment in the entire building.”

According to the Lee Chapel Director Robert C. Peniston,
the museum will be thoroughly renovated to include “state
of the art displays,” conveying a new storyline which
Peniston says will “speak to the heritage of George
Washington, Robert E. Lee, and the history of the Univer-
sity.” The story line entailed three years of research by the
special collections committee, headed by Mr. Litzenburg.
Other members include author Mary Coulling (The Lee
Girls), Mr. Peniston, and Washington and Lee historians

i Taylor Sanders and Holt Merchant.

The story line will weave together the stories of three
great families of Virginia and our institution,” says
Litzenburg. “The three families, the Washingtons, the

 Custis’, and the Lees are remarkably related to each other.

The history of the institution covers much of the history of
the families. History itself unfolds naturally to give prin-
ciple focus to Robert E. Lee.”

Renovation downstairs also includes a handicapped
access to the museum near Traveller’s gravesite, new
restrooms, and an improved security system. Although

The picturesque Lee Chapel, with over 55,000
visitors per year, is the most popular tourist
spot in Lexington.

Lee's office will remain in its current location, his original
burial site, characterized by a plaque in the center of the
museum ﬂoor, will be highlighted in the plan.

Lee Chapel hosts nearly 55,00 visitors per year and is
often a site for weddings, even with the absence of a center
isle. Like most of the traditions at W&L, Lee Chapel has
witnessed little change throughout the years. A section was
added in 1883 with a monument to Lee and the recumbent
statue of General Lee by Edward Valentine. Lee’s remains
were removed at that time from beneath the chapel to the
crypt where his parents, wife, seven children, and other
family members were laid to rest. The lastest renovations
took place in 1963 with a generous gift of $370,000 from
the Ford Motor Company.

unaware of the problem. He asked his Management 101
and International Trade classes, “Do we have a hazing
problem on campus?”

A few students nodded their heads yes, while the
majority said no. “A number said we are no worse than
anyone else,” Anderson stated.

He followed by asking, “Is ourcommunity open enough
that if someone felt strongly enough about it, they could
step forward and say something?” Nearly all of the
students who spoke up said yes.

Anderson was troubled by the response of his classes.
“What I find disturbing is that most of the class believes
our community is open enough to tolerate dissent on the
question of hazing, yet none of those students who nodded
their heads were willing to speak up, and I am left wonder-
ing why.”

Prof. Anderson is not the only member of the W&L
community to be troubled by the article and its implica-
tions. Freshman Romy Rosenbaum said, ‘‘It makes me
really upset that my classmates would let this be done to
them, and then turn around and do it themselves.”

Obviously, the University has been disturbed by the
New York Times piece on hazing. “The article, without
a doubt, is not good for the University or for our Greek
system,” said Mazzarelli. “But one positive effect that will
come out of it is that it will bring to the attention of all the
Greek males the severity of the situation.”

Dean Atkins echoed Mazzarelli’s sentiments. “I hope
that the positive impact of the article will be that fraterni-
ties will realize how bad this really looks— That no matter
what kind of perverse attaehement they have for [hazing],
they will take the lead and say they will not allow guys who
are going to do that to remain in their fraternities. That it
is totally unacceptable.”

The SAC’s proposed policy has been distributed to the
faculty and will be voted on at December faculty meeting.
If passed, “The bottom line is that the choice [to haze] is up
to each person who is Greek,” said Mazzarelli. “If you take
the chance, you won ’t be able to hide behind your house.”

VANDALISM. from pg. 1

According to their Statement of Belief, a standard of
behavior is inherent in the University’s dedication to
honor, and students are bound to this standard just as they
are bound to the Honor System.

“I feel strongly that vandalism shows disrespect for
personal or university property and that under our new
constitution, the focus is on respect for others as the corner
stone of student conduct,” said Covington.

Dean of Freshmen and Residence Life, Dennis Man-
ning, believes the student sanctioned SCC allows students
to send an important message to other students— that
vandalism will not be tolerated in any fomr. “The policy
is much more meaningful when it is inforced by students’
peers.” »

New Cable 2 show ‘Singles-Out’ students

BY C.E. MILLER
PHI STAFF WRITER

Cable channel two will be a little spunkier, a little lively
and a Iittler lovelier. “Singled Out” Washington and Lee-
style will begin to air this Wednesday, Nov. 13.

Junior Omar Vannoy and Freshman Lora Ellison will
be producing the show. The two came up with the idea after
they met at an introductory meeting for Cable 2.

“I thought it was a shame that the school had all this
equipment and nobody was using it for anything,” said
Ellison. “I wanted to do a show or something, and Omar
and I came up with idea of reproducing “Singled Out” for
Washington and Lee.”

The show will be almost identical to that on MTV, but
instead of 50 single men and women there will be around
30.

“That’s all the room will really hold,” said Ellison.
“Fifty would be stretching it a bit.”

The concept behind “Singled Out” is that there is one
female and one male trying to ﬁnd a match from the pool
of 30 contestants. The contestants are eliminated on the
basis of categories. such as Body Hair, Chest Size, Lip
Size, Party Attitudes, etc.

After the pool has been narrowed down to a manageable

number, the male or female doing the picking whittles the
remaining few down to three by eliminating the others
through humiliating tricks.

Finally, the last round consists of the final three
contestants who choose one of two answers to a preset
question. Iftheiranswermatches
the individual’s, they advance.
The ﬁrst contestant into the circle
wins.

Okay, if all that confused you,
check out the show on MTV; it is
a lot easier to watch than to ex-
plain.

Auditions for hosts were held
last night. The male host will be
Paul Hourigan’98 and the female
hostwill be Meagan Johnson ’98.
The producers were looking for
two hosts like Jenny McCarthy
and Chris Hardwick from the
MTV version.

“We weren’t looking for a Jenny McCarthy body
double,” said Vannoy.“Wewanted someone whois spunky,
spontaneous and looks good on camera.”

The show will be ﬁlmed this Sunday, Nov. 10 at 2 p.m.
According to Vannoy, there isn’t time to do more than one

 

take, so the host needs to be able to go through the show
without doing a lot of stuff over.

Ellison and Vannoy stress the need for participants. The
show needs 30 single guys and 30 single girls to partici-
pate. A freshman girl and a senior guy have agreed to be

the firstsingled-outcontestants.
“The girl is pretty and the_
guy isreallywitty,” Ellison said.

The winners will be given a

gift certificate for a dinner at
one of the restaurants in town.

Anyone interested in help-
ing out with “Singled-Out” is
encouraged to contact Vannoy
or Ellison.

“We need lots of people for
this show to work,” Ellison said.
‘‘If you don’t want to be a con-
testant, we need people to work
behind-the-scenes too.”

The last game show to air on Cable 2 was “The
Washington and Lee Dating Game,” hosted and produced
by Chris Albert ’95. It was similar to “Singled-Out” in that
it sent couples on dates, but it followed the format of “The
Dating Game.” It was successful and many students
participated.

pests. McDowell was assigned to the story. Later that
afternoon, he returned to the newsroom with his copy. The
dateline read: Somewhere in Capitol Square with the
Govemor’s Squirrel Expedition. Everyone loved it, and
McDowell’s reputation ﬂourished.

Mudd said it was a common morning experience to hear
the familiar chatter of “Did you read Charlie?” It seemed
like everyone read Charlie McDowell. When the Times-
Dispatch sent reporters to the national political conven-
tions, McDowell was always among them. He once
befriended a bell-hop at the 1952 Republican Convention
in Chicago so that he could make his way into the kitchen
where party leaders were directing the show. The series
entitled “Keep it Clean” was typical McDowell — infor-
mative and compelling, yet stylish and readable.

“He had this way of relating what was happening to the
reader in a simple and direct way,” said Mudd. “He’s been
recognized because he’s a steady hand. His sharp eye and
gentle humor have not succumbed to the blandishments of
Washington’s elite.”

McDowell grew up and developed his trademark sense
of humor here in Lexington, Virginia. He loves to tell the
story of a zoology professor who paid him $10 to place the
department's skeleton of a dog next to the skeleton of
Traveller, which used to be on display in the Lee House
garage. When confused tourists would inquire about the
smaller set of bones, McDowell would chime up, “That
was Traveller as a pony.”

Once hewas enrolled at Washington and Lee, McDowell
played on the basketball team. As he was an unusually tall
and lanky kid, his uniform had a way of falling off his
shoulders and exposing his pasty white belly. To remedy
the problem, McDowell used to tape his shirt up so as to
secure it upon his torso. When his name was called during
the team’s introduction to the fans, McDowell would run
out of the locker room and onto the court where invariably
the tape job would come undone. The shirt would fall to its
usual length and he would be exposed much to the crowd’s
delight.

Although McDowell formally resigned from the Times-
Dispatch in 1992, he continues to contribute special assign-
ments and write a Sunday column. He can also be seen on
PBS program “Washington Week in Review.”

McDowell was recently quoted in the Times-Dispatch
where he said of his long and distinguished career, “It’s
been a good run, a darn good run.”

FOOTBALL. from pg. 8

While Emory & Henry’s thoughts will
be squarely on winning the title, Miriello
said the Generals will concentrate more
on playing well than discussing the mag-
nitude of the game.

‘‘It would be a tremendous victory if
we won,” he said. “It’s going to take a
monumental effort to do it. lt’s not going
to be easy for us.”

The Generals will need to move the
ball better and not depend as much on
turnovers, since according to Miriello,
the Wasps do not make many mistakes.

In fact, the Wasps’ game plan will be
pretty simple.

“They’re gonna try to run the ball
down our throats,” Miriello said. “This
game is not wearing on their minds. I
hope they come in overconfident.”

But at least the Generals seem to be
catching Emory & Henry at the right
time. This will be the first time since

1978 that the two teams did not meet in
September, a month in which the Gener-
als have gone 1-6-1 over the last three
years. In October and November the last
three years, however, W&L has a record
of 13-5.

The same trend of gaining momen-
tum late in the season has held this year,

since the Generals have won three straight
to nullify a 1-4 start.

The football team’s slow starts and
fast ﬁnishes are largely dependent on the
schedule and the many new faces in the
lineup early each season, Miriello said.

“The first half of the the schedule is
usually more difficult,” he said. ‘‘In the

second half, we’re playing schools some-
what similar to ourselves.”

No matter how they got to this point,
the Generals have a chance of upsetting
Emory & Henry this Saturday and possi-
bly capturing a league title. Considering
their 1-4 start this year, a chance is all the
Generals could ask for.

Recently, G. Gordon Liddy said,
“Clinton’s ‘bridge to the 21st cen-
tury’ is a toll bridge, and we’re all
going to have to pay.”

Everyonebreakouttheirchange.

Election “96 is over, and,
not to anyone’s surprise, Bill
Clinton has been reelected.
However, to some people's sur-
prise, he still did not receive a
majority, just a plurality.
Clinton received 49.2% of the
vote, compared to 40.8% for
Dole, 8.5% for Perot, and 1%
for Ralph Nader.

Another surprise was that a
majority of women voted for

Clinton and a majority of men
voted for Dole. ABC said
that had never happened be-
fore--usually both sexes vote
for the winner, if by different
margins.

There were several impor-
tant ballot initiatives, and in
the biggest mass case of
schizophrenia everwitnessed,
California voted to legalize
marijuanaformedicinal purposes
and voted to end affirmative ac-
tion programs in the state.

Florida jumped on the
schizophrenia bandwagon
also, passing the initiative de-
signed to force the billionaire
sugar farmers to clean up pol-
lution in the Florida Ever-
glades, but did not pass the
one cent tax increase to help
pay for it. Florida also passed

an amendment to their consti-
tution calling for a two-thirds
majority for new taxes to be
written into their constitution,
designed to fight a movement
for a state income tax.

As ofThursday evening, the
Republicans look like they
will have a 55-45 majority in
the Senate, picking up two
seats (the still-contested Or-
egon race is being led by the
Republican candidate as of
4pm Thursday). The House is
still Republican also, but there
are six seats still outstanding.
The Missouri lndependent, Jo
Ann Emerson, will probably align
herself with the Republicans. The
38 seat majority they had in 1994
now stands at 19.

Does this send any kind of
mandate to Washington?

Plainly spoken, no. The Wash-
ington politicians should see that
the American people want the
two parties to work together, and
since the last Congress got done
what they said they would, the
people might hold them to it this
time. A

Bill Clinton’s next term will
be interesting to watch. The
“egomaniacal” President
Clinton, as Senior Mark Tobias
so eloquently stated, has done
everything in the hopes of get-
ting re-elected. Now what? He has
no election to work for, so he is
reportedly going to set his sights on
“writing his name in the history
books.” Some of his advisors have
said he will turn to the international
arena, which should frighten
America and our allies.

Luckily, there will be a new
Secretary of State. Warren
Christopher is resigning, along
with Transportation Secretary
Fredrico Pena, Energy Secretary
Hazel O’Leary, Commerce Sec-
retary Micky Kantor, and De-

fense Secretary William Perry. »

Others are rumored to be on
Clinton’s chopping block, and
Republicans may fill a few of
the spots.

Cross country teams perform solidly at ODACs

Men fall short
ofthird straight

BY SCOTT BOOKWALTER
PHI SPORTS EI)rroR

It just wasn’t to be this year
for the men’s cross country
squad.

The Generals were looking
for their third straight ODAC
title in Lynchburg Saturday, but
they were halted by the host
Hornets. Lynchburg captured
its first title since 1993 with a
total of 27 points, while W&L
earned runner—up honors with
45 points, ahead of third-place
ROanOke’s 57. The Hornets had
five of the top ten ﬁnishers.

Junior Will Olson ran a ter-
rific race, finishing second be-

hind Lynchburg’s Jeff Conant
in a time of 27:11.42. Junior
Jason Callen was not far behind
as he pulled into fifth place with
his 27:21 .92. Olson and Callen’s
outstanding performances
earned them each All-ODAC
honors.

Junior Taylor Shultz also
placed in the top-ten, as he
crossed the line in ninth with his
time of 28:00.54. Sophomore
Darrick Alford came in 12th in
28:26.26 and sophomore
Stephen Guenther placed 17th
in 28:49.06.

The Generals may not have
defended their title successfully
in Lynchburg, but they will be
back in title-defense mode again
this weekend when they com-
pete in the Division III South
regionals at Mary Washington.
The men snared the regional title
last year in Memphis.

Carson Flowers has quickly
proved that there is life. after
Josephine Schaeffer.

“No one will ever be
.losephine,” Flowers said.

But one would not have been
able to tell much difference at
Saturday’s ODAC Champion-
ships in Lynchburg. In
Schaeffer-like fashion, Flowers
won the women’s cross country
race and boosted the team to its
fourth title in five years.

While Flowers has been in
the league’s top echelon of run-
ners all season, she surprised
even herself in her performances
this year as well as her leader-
ship ability with Schaeffer hav-
ing graduated.

“I did not know prior to the
season if I would be able to step
in and lead the team,” she said.
“We had many excellent run-
ners returning, and I didn’t know
what the season would bring for
my teammates or myself.”

All it has brought is aconfer-
ence title and an ODAC Runner
of the Year award, respectively.

ored to be named the ODAC
Runner of the Year,” she said.

Flowers sealed the deal after
crossing the finish line Saturday
in 20:24.61, a startling 41 sec-
onds ahead of runner-up Shelli
Stevens of Roanoke. Nat
Messmore was right behind
Stevens in third place, as the
senior finished her ﬁnal ODAC
race in a time of 21:06.70.
Sophomore Lisa Brennan also
had a terrific race for the Gener-
als, placing sixth in 21:26.97.
The "performances of Flowers,
Messmore and Brennan earned
them All-ODAC awards.

Also placing well for the
Generals were sophomore
Natasha Dorofeeva in 11th posi-
tion and freshman Jenny Webb
in 12th place.

Despite running on
Lynchburg’s turf, the Generals
easily out-distanced the host
Hornets. W&L had 35 team
pointswhileLynchburgwaswell
behind with 60. Eastern Men-
nonite, Roanoke and Emory &
Henry finished third, fourth and
fifth, respectively.

“We were pretty confident
that we would be able to win
ODACs ifwe all ran hard,” Flow-

was Lynchburg College and we
had. beaten them before. They
have a very challenging course,
and we felt confident, due to our
training, that we could beat them
on their home course.”

The Generals will try to win
on an opponent’s turf once again
this weekend when they travel
to Fredericksburg to run in the
South regional championship at
Mary Washington College.

“We are really excited about
regionals this weekend,” Flow-
ers said. “I feel very confident
that the team will run well. A
few of us have aspirations for
nationals and we all hope to run
well enough to qualify.”

With yet another ODAC
championship in tow, the
women’s team will be placed in
the familiar position next year
of being the team to beat, just
like during the Schaeffer years.
But it is hard to bet against W&L
as Flowers and her teammates
plan to keep the ODAC crown in
Lexington for awhile.

“Next year we are hoping to
win the ODACs once again and
all run well and injury-free,” she
said. “I hope to continue run-
ning well and help our team keep
our ODAC title.”

quarterﬁnal
round of
the ODAC men’s soccer tourna-
ment Tuesday.

 

W&L will now meet regular
season champion Roanoke in the
semifinals Friday afternoon.

The victory improves W&L’s
record to 11-5, tying the school
record for wins set in 1986.

After a scoreless first half,
Chase gave the Generals a 1-0
lead just over five minutes into
the second half off an assist from
sophomore Mikel Parker.
Superfrosh Jamie Parker then
iced the game on a goal withjust
over six minutes remaining in
the contest.

The goal was Parker’s 19th
of the season, breaking the
school record of 18 set last year
by Chase.

Things then turned ugly in
the waning moments. A brawl
ensued, resulting in the ejection
of two Randolph-Macon play-
ers.

W&L sophomore goalie
Garry Hill made five saves to
record his third shutout of the

season.

This marksthe Generals’ first
trip to the ODAC semifinals
since 1992. They are looking to
avenge a 3-1 regular season de-
feat at the hands of the Roanoke
Maroons.

Meanwhile, the women’s
soccer team ended its season on
a disappointing note, the victim
of a 2-0 upset to Roanoke in the
ODAC semifinals. Roanoke
scored a goal in each half for the
victory.

Despite the loss, the Gener-
als finished up the year with a
record of 12-5. The twelve vic-
tories set a new Washington and
Lee school record for wins in a
season.

Sophomore Karin Treese’s
18 goals tied the W&L record
for tallies in a season, set by

It may have been ugly, but the Gener-
als will take the
win.

W a s h i n g t O n
and Lee and
Bridgewater com-
bined for 15 tum-
overs in their foot-
ball game Satur-
day, but the Gener-
als did more with
their opportunities
as they dumped the
host Eagles, 24-13.
The victory enabled the Generals to slide
into third place in the ODACwith their 4-
4 overall mark, 2-2 in the league.

 

“Sometimes it wasn’t very pretty with
the turnovers,” head coach Frank Miriello
said, “but it was a critical game for us to
get to .500.”

The Generals committed six of the
game’s 15 turnovers, many of which
Miriello said was caused by the wind and
the fact that W&L was experimenting
with some younger players. But consid-
eringthat Bridgewater, a perennial league
doormat, was coasting along at 4-3, 2-2
in the league this year, the Generals were
happy to escape with the win.

“Bridgewater is a really improved
team,” Miriello said. “They thought they
were going to smash us. We took it to
them- it was very, very satisfying.”

The Generals fell behind early when
Bridgewater’s Mario Webb scored on a
19-yard run to give the Eagles a 7-0 edge
in the first quarter. W&L turned the ball

back over to Bridgewater on the next
series, but the Eagles returned the favor
when W&L junior safety Lee Miller
picked off a pass and scampered 61 yards
all the way to the Bridgewater 4-yard
line. From there, junior Seth McKinley
grabbed a touchdown pass from senior
quarterback Brooks Fischer to knot the
score at 7.

Junior Matt Holbrook notched his sev-
enth ﬁeld goal of the season midway
through the second quarter when he con-
nected from 35 yards out to give the
Generals a 10-7 lead.

It remained that way until late in the
half when disaster struck again for
Bridgewater. Freshman Scott King
busted through to sack the Bridgewater
quarterback and caused a fumble that
was recovered by senior noseguard Neil
Kelleter on the Bridgewater 2. The Gen-
erals once again took full advantage of
the break when McKinley scored again
on a one-yard plunge to give W&L a 17-
7 advantage at halftime. '

Bridgewater looked to rally in the
second half, but the Generals’ defense
was not in the mood. Early in the third
quarter, junior linebacker Matt Luka
smashed the Bridgewater quarterback
from behind, forcing another fumble.
Defensive end Jack Boyd grabbed the
looseball and chugged 24 yards to paydirt,
giving the Generals a commanding 24-7
lead.

Boyd wreaked havoc on the Eagles’
offense all day as he also intercepted a
pass, broke up another one and made
three tackles. His brother McGuire led
the Generals with ten tackles on the after-
noon.

Sophomore Brad Baker and senior
Chris Watson also made interceptions to
facilitate the Generals’ stifling defensive
effort, whilejunior Omar Moneimjoined
King and Luka in the sack department.
The Generals defense held Bridgewater
to only 175 yards of total offense on the

day. The Eagles also hurt themselves
with eight penalties.

After the teams slogged back and forth
for most of the second half, Bridgewater
scored an academic touchdown on a Von
Lewis touchdown catch with only 2:28
remaining in the game. The Eagles then
missed the PAT, making the ﬁnal margin
24-13, the same score as the Generals’
win last season.

While the W&L defense rose to the
occasion in Bridgewater, the offense
could not get going. The Generals had a
difficult time moving the ball all after-
noon, totalling a mere 132 yards of total
Offense, although they scored when it
counted. Fischer completed 12 of 19
passes for 75 yards, leaving him 60 yards
short of overtaking Phillip Sampson
(1986-89) as W&L’s all-time passing
leader. Fischer now has 4,389 yards
passing for his career.

The Generals could not get much of a
ground game going either Saturday.
Sophomore Floyd Young led the team
with 31 yards on 13 carries and McKinley
added 28 yards on 15 attempts. Senior
Jon Gardner was W&L’s leading receiver
as he caught three passes for 23 yards.

The key win on the road sets up an
interesting matchup this weekend in Lex-
ington when W&L and Emory & Henry
square off with, yes, the ODAC title on
the line. Emory & Henry would win its
third consecutive league championship
with a victory over the Generals. But if
the Generals prevail and second place
Randolph—Macon loses either to
Bridgewater this week or Hampden-
Sydney next week, W&L will capture its
first ODAC title since 1985.

One big problem though: Emory &
Henry has beaten W&L 13 straight times
dating back to 1982, including a 35-22
victory last year. E&H leads the all-time
series 19-6.

Focus on our
real education,
not our grades

Life on the Hill
C. E. Miller ’98

The freshman midterm grades
are in, and looks like the adminis-
tration has proof. Winter Rush is a
good thing, the grades are the high-
est they have ever been. It seems
this school keeps getting better and
better. If I applied for the class of
2,000 there would have been a big
fat rejection in my mailbox. I am
not smart enough to be at this
school. At least smart as the ad-
ministration has deﬁned it with the
selection of the sophomore and
freshman classes.

What do I mean, well the way I
see it many of the students ac-
cepted here have learned to jump
through all the hoops. Apply to a
specific number of schools and
have the correct amount of com-
munity service and extra curricu-

_ lar activities on the resume. They

performed well in high school and
took the SAT prep courses. The
list goes on and on. It is a formula
for success in the world these indi-
viduals are looking to gain en-

ting an A.

trance into.
: I thought maybe this process

wjould stop when we reached ear: "

lege. But it is solmuch more for-
malized. I always hear students
Complaining bitterly about the
grades they have received jeopar-
dizing the chance to get into a good
graduate school, law school, or
medical school. I get told by these
same people that its okay for me to
have a B- average because I only
want to finish college.

What I want to know is: where
is the learning process. I sit through
classes where the only answers
given to my professors are out of
the textbook. Directly out of the
textbook word for word. These
aren’t science or math classes, these
are classes that ask for students to
analyze. These classes ask for the
person to think about the reading,
to apply it, and to understand it.

To think for oneself. To read, to
understand, to think beyond the
surface of the material. This is what
a liberal arts school is about. Espe-

cially when one is in the arts de-
partments. Science majors are a
different breed. I know one, I live
with one. The issue is about facts,
about X=Y. I don’t care if my
doctor understands Homeric
epithaphs.

The people I am really con-
cerned about are those sophomore
and freshmen that I see fumbling
to survive in a liberal arts atmo-
sphere, by simply following the
formulas that got them here. I hear
conversations all the time that re-
fer to cold tests, and what the for-
mula to follow is to get the A.

There is so much more to life
than getting the A. Maybe profes-
sors need to stress that more. I
don’t know if the school is failing
to educate us, or we are failing to
educate ourselves. I don’t want to
include everyone in this. I have
been in many classes where this
was not true. Mostly upper level
classes with fewer than 10 stu-
dents; classes that demanded par-
ticipation and original thought.

I guess this is mostly a message
to those of you who hyperventilate
at the mention of a B-. Get over it.
It isn’t the end of the world. To the
administration this isn’t about tum-
ing out a school full of people with
the same grades, who can recite the
same information, and make the
university statistics little bit better.

This is about preparing students
with a liberal education, one that
will help them in many areas of
theirlife, teaching them to think, to
apply, to understand.

Stop the intense focus on grades.
My freshman class had the highest
first term grades ever, the class
after us beat our record, and I am
sure the freshman of ’00 will shat-
ter that record again.

ments that really matter, Habitat

ﬁghting hunger. This is what makes
us real, what binds us together.
Grades are irrelevant. In 10 or 15
years, I’ll come back and no one is
going to care that I graduated with
a B- average, and it probably won’t
have destroyed me that I didn’t go
to a prestigious graduate school.
What matters is teaching us to re-
ally think, think of solutions to the
everyday unsolvable issues-—crime,
poverty, balancing the budget.

So this is my challenge to the
administration--publicize the ser-
vice of the students that make a
difference in the character of the
student. The Robert E. Lee ideal
gentlemen and lady. Grades are
such a small part of success and
are overwhelmingly stressed. The
obsession with breaking into the
top 10 in US News & World Re-
port is misguiding the focus of
Washington and Lee students.

The big W&L hazing compromise

GreenLand
Betsy Green ’97

By now, everyone is probably
aware of the article in The New
York Times magazine about haz-
ing at A Certain Conservative,
Selective Liberal Arts School In
The East Named After Two Dead
Generals Which Shall Remain
Nameless.

Reactions here have been strong.
Some have said that the hazing
described in that article is repug-
nant, barbaric, and simply wrong.
Others have responded with an elo-
quent, “Yeah, so?” I

I think hazing, especially the
things described in that article, is
disgusting. It has no place in the
civilized and otherwise gentile so-
ciety of Washington and Lee. I
also think that fraternities and so-
rorities are a vital part of life at
Washington and Lee that should
be perpetuated. I do not think
these two points of view are mutu-

’ allyiexclusive.

Becoming a brother or sister in
a fraternity should mean some-
thing to pledges. Our new
pledgeship should not become a
mere formality. Pledges should
know what a particular fraternity
stands for, or else it’s just a group
of guys who give out plastic cups.
It’s not unreasonable to expect that
pledges recognize more of the
Greek alphabet than the letters of

their particular house. Basically,
if all you had to do to consider
yourself a brother in a fraternity
was to hang out at the house and go
to a few parties, then call me a
brother. On the other hand, I don’t
think anyone who forced me to
wear vomit soaked clothes or to
partake of an armpit snack is any-
one 1 would want to call my brother.
Surely there is a middle ground.

Compromise will not be easy.
A suggestion I had heard was for
pledge trainers to call up the IFC or
Dean Leroy C. “Buddy” Atkins to
get potential pledge activities ap-
proved. Can you imagine it?

Fraternity Guy: Dean Atkins,
we were planning on getting our
pledges real drunk and tying them
naked to trees next Saturday. What
do you think?

Buddy: Hmmm... I’m going
to have to say no to that right away.
I know for a fact there’s an SAB-
sponsored concert at the pavilion
on Saturday. Maybe you should
take your pledges there instead.

Fraternity Guy #2: Our

"house is planning one of its most

treasured pledgeship activities for
next Friday night. lt’s the one
where we line up all the pledges
and kick them in the face. Y’know,
the annual Face Kicking. Would
that be okay? We’ve already made
sure the pledges don’t have too
much studying to do that night,
and there are no alternative gather-
ings in the Pit either. Also, in light
of our sensitivity to the new hazing

policy, we’ve asked the brothers
not to weal’ their boots this year.
Buddy: I’m afraid I can’t ap-
prove that program as it stands, but
I can think of a good compromise.
If you have an equal number of
brothers getting kicked in the face,
then it’s not hazing. Then y’all are

ing is the one

just stupid.

Imagine"'whe're‘“this scenario ' "

would lead. The next chapter meet-
ing is the one where all of the
brothers are asked to volunteer to
be kicked in the face. Suspecting
that a few people might choose to
skip that particular meeting, the
president imposes a $500 fine for
anyone not attending. Other broth-
ers are reported to say, “Who cares?
I’m just going to charge it home
anyway.”

I do think that pledges need to

have some kind of common expe-
riences to be a cohesive unit. And
men might not respond to the kind
of bonding experiences in soror-
ity pledgeship... like your big sis-
ter maliciously breaking into your
room, filling it with crepe paper,
and giving you candy and cook-
ies. I really don’t think it will be
so hard for guys to figure out
what’s okay and what’s not if you
follow one rule of thumb: Would
you want your mom to know you
are doing this?

Would your mom be upset if
you knew the Greek alphabet re-
ally well? No, she’d find some
way to be proud of you for it.
Would your mom be traumatized
if she saw you asking a younger
student to get you a beer? If she
did, she’d get over it. Would
your mom be worried if you had
to clean a house after a party?
She’d probably just ask why you
don’t do that at home. And would
mom mind if you and a bunch of
your friends went to Hollins for

*the night? Nalv... boys will be

boys. "

But would it be okay with mom
to see you getting branded? To
see you chugging Mad Dog and
raw eggs? To see you beating
another guy with a paddle? Un-
less your childhood was radically
different than mine, I’d bet not.

So, you see, hazing isn’t such
a complicated issue after all. Be
decent, be safe, and do.-1’t forget
about your mom.

Clinton’s victory is a victory for America

From the Left
Laura Knapp ’99

It has been well over a week since President
Bill Clinton scored an amazing, decisive, but
totally anticipated victory over Bob Dole. But
because it has been a week, my gloating has
subsided quite a bit. Had I written this a week
ago, the column for the most part would be
filled with comments like “Nyah nyah nyah
nyah! We won, and you lost! Told you so! So
there!” But within the space of seven days, I
developed a new sense of maturity and am now
able to discuss the outcome of the election with
minimal boasting and bragging.

In all honesty though, I am breathing a sigh
of relief for the United States, for world civili-
zation, as well as for humanity itself rather than
brimming with arrogance over Clinton’s vic-
tory. The United States is virtually ensured of
entering the twenty-first century on stable foot-
ing, of course not taking in account a double
assassination of both Clinton and Gore where
in which the Speaker of the House would
become President (a fact that was recently

brought to my attention which I consider just
crazy on the part of the Founding Fathers. But
to their credit, they did not know about Newt
Gingrich when they were drawing up the Con-..
stitution; for had they known him, I am sure
that they would have thought twice about in-
cluding such a provision! Could you even
imagine Gingrich as president? I myself would
take the bullet and endanger my life for Clinton
or Gore in order to prevent such an occur-
rence.) I shudder with fear when I consider the
effects of a Dole presidency would have on the
present and future of our nation. His 15% tax
cut-although assumed to be politically popular
equated to financial irresponsibility-would have
propelled the United States into a huge finan-
cial crisis as well as exacerbate the problem of
the burgeoning budget deﬁcit even more.
There are just a plethora of reasons why
Americans—Dem0crats and Republicans
alike—should be relieved that Bill Clinton
won. We have been promised a moderate and
thoughtful administration. Improvements for
public education, the environment, race rela-
tions, Afﬁrrnative Action programs, welfare
and general tolerance will all be realized over
the next four years. I could not write such a

thing had Bob Dole won.

What I believe to be the most comforting
about a Clinton presidency is that he actually
cares about what the American people really
want. He is not subservient to special interests,
military complexes or a professed Washington
insider as was Bob Dole. The triumph of
Clinton in this election symbolizes the fact that
a president can be independent of such forces
that have at times dominated the presidential
arena. It is a remarkable trend that I hope
continues. It is obvious from the results of the
election——a Democratic executive and Repub-
lican legislature—that Americans are showing
that they are indeed moving towards the center
of the political spectrum; they have had enough
of extremism. The fact that Bill Clinton has
made an effort to include Republicans on his
cabinet indicates both a sense of maturity on
his part as well as a realization that Americans
are not either Democrat or Republican. What
is right for the nation is no longer-if it ever was-
dependent on party distinction. Clinton em-
bodies tolerance, moderation and what is right
forthe nation. Ifyou don’tbelieve it, I’ll let you
quarrel with the 2.5 million people that voted
for him.

Having been dead for nearly thirty

Notoriously raunchy in its later years,

speak to any individual people. We want
to provide a forum for independent

To this end, Southern Collegian will

magazine will welcome all opinions, with
the exception of the opinions of the ex-

Resmer. “We’re hoping that Southern
Collegian will evolve into something
that’s a combination of the three.”

In addition to political articles, each
issue of Southern Collegian will include
three or four poems, as well as a short
story.

“We want to be more general,”
Christensen stated. “We welcome any-

egiern ehekee off the eluet

to Spectator,” Resmer commented. “We
‘don’t want to be so serious.”

“We just want to have fun,” she added.
“We want our stories and articles to be
provocative and interesting.”

Southern Collegian is an independent
publication. The magazine will fund
itself through advertising, donations, and
subscriptions, but it will receive no fund-

Christensen stated.

True to its original format, the recent
re-incamation of Southern Collegian will

“We have basically three goals: to be

SCA Covoris in hcavg armor

Pm AssrsTANr FEATURES EDrroR

“My Lord, what may I do to service you?” This statement
is not often heard, but if you were to attend an event sponsored
by the Society of Creative Anachronisms, this would not seem
so strange and maybe even commonplace. The SCA was begun
by a group of students attending the University of California,
Berkley, in the 1960’s. Members attempt to “recreate the best
of the Middle Ages” says Scott Silvers, President of the SCA
here at Washington and Lee.

The group has a 2 year history here at W&L with 10-15
active members. The group holds meetings every Monday
night at 8:30 in room 113 of the University Center. The group
sponsors activities like the movie night held 2 weeks ago. A
dance practice will be held Tuesday night in the game room of
the University Center. The dances of the Middle Ages are
relatively easy and quick to learn. Anyone who is interested
may contact Scott Silvers for more information or come to the
meeting this Monday.

One of the main activities of the group is recreation of
medieval ﬁghting.

Silvers commented, “The SCA is your chance to live out
that fantasy of being a knight in shining armour. Our battles
are non-choreographed, and in the larger battles there can be
several thousand ﬁghters on the ﬁeld.”

Scott became involved in the SCA his freshman year. “I
was a fencer and I heard about the SCA and thought that
sounds cool. There was no one to fence with so I started
heavy ﬁghting.” Silvers authorized to fight in events in 1995
and since then has taken part in baronial as well as kingdom
level ﬁghting. Women also are able to take part in heavy
ﬁghting, and are encouraged to do so. A crown tourney is held
every six months in which ﬁghters battle for the crown. The
king is the winner of the tourney and can be either male or
female.

Silvers believes that everyone would ﬁnd something ap-
pealing about the SCA. “There is more than just fighting in the
SCA. We dance, we sing, and have artisans who make all
kinds of crafts (i.e. brewing, woodworking, sewing, and
armouring). “ A person can create a new persona and become
whatever they want. It is really up to them. Silvers invites
anyone to come and learn what a cloven fruit is and the
wondrous joys it evokes. ’

Luhrmann, Shakespeare
meet /vapp//1//'/7 /?&/

BY ALEX CHRISTENSEN
Pm MovrE CRmc

~A'3‘nh‘r of 4 stars;
better than bad, It‘s good

The pitch:
“lt'll be like Pulp Fiction
meets Romeo and Juliet. ”

I was quite cautious in making the Pulp Fiction reference in
my pitch (above). The purpose of my “pitch” is to give you an
idea what the ﬁlm is like, or what the makers might have
thought it was like. Too many ﬁlms have been compared toPulp
Fiaion recently, but I think that in this case it is warranted. Both
tell complex stories, both use violence and witty dialogue to
maximum effect, and both are jarring both in style and in content.

Romeo and Juliet has had many incarnations. I still have
part of the balcony scene memorized from high school English
class. And I’ve seen the 1968 Fraco Zefferelli version where
you see Olivia Hussey’s bosoms and Leonard Whiting stand-
ing naked in the window. I’ve missed, however, most of the
other versions, including some silent ones, clunky early ones

with old actors, the ballet, and some freer adaptations like West
Side Story and others.

William Shakespeare ’s Romeo andJuliet is a ﬁne film. For
those of you who have not seen Strictly Ballroom, Australian
director Baz Luhrmann’s wonderful comic romance about
professional ballroom dancing, it may be a bit jarring to
experience a Baz Luhrmann ﬁlm-——so many hits of R+J played
for their comic effect, the elder characters treated like buffoons
who don’t “get it,” and the constant blare of “cool” music. It is
jarring, and it is meant to be so. Luhrmann’s ﬁlm work, so far at
least, has been about youth, and how in its optimism, energy, and
inexperience, it is so ultimately human and real. That’s why he’s
perfect for this modern adaptation of William Shakespeare’s play.

Luhrmann also understands what the point of an updating
of a classic work is. Of course, it’s a completely different
approach, than, say, Kenneth Branagh takes when adapting
such works as Henry V or Hamlet. The point is not to honor
every intention of the author, but to reveal new things both
about the work and about the time we live in. So Shakespeare
purists may not like this ﬁlm. However, what Luhrmann does
is truly a work of genius.

Luhrmann sets R+J in a mythical Florida town called
Verona Beach. This town is completely created artistically by
the ﬁlmmakers—you can’t visit it. It was ﬁlmed in Mexico
City and in locations around Veracruz, Mexico, but the way it is
handled, it becomesa real place to the audience. Towering over the
city are a blocky stone Virgin Mary at the Chapel Monument and
two great skyscrapers, marked “Montague” and “Capulet.”

The young members of each faction carry guns emblazoned
with family crests and duel openly in the streets. The story
unfolds quickly, wittily, and touchingly, not weighed down,

I -but rather wonderfully-revealedgby theElizabethan dialogue of

the characters. Yes, the text has been cut, some have said too
much, but I felt that the ﬁlm worked. lcould, I suppose, go back
and get my copy of the play and bring it in and mark all the cuts,
but that would hardly tell me anything about whether it worked.
I think it did, quite well.

Another thing that Luhrmann has done in his handlingof the
story and the language is to exploit new meanings of old words
to great effect. In doing so, he rather disarmingly takes
advantage of the great mystery of language, which almost
never takes away or assigns a new meaning to a word without
enriching rather than empoverishing its power.

Speciﬁcally, in a device which works quite well, Luhrmann
changes Mercutio, Romeo’s best friend, into a black, dreadlocked
youth who dresses in drag, uses drugs with Romeo, and is ultimately
the catalyst for the second half of the story. Jolm McEnery did a
superb, haunting job with the “conventional” Mercutio in Franco
Zeﬁ”ere1li’s version, so I was both dreading and looking forward to
Harold Perrineau ’s (of S make) take on him in this version. He went
far beyond my expectations and alleviated all my fears. Penineau is
altemately grave and insanely blissful in what is ultimately a very
enlightening deconstruction of the character, which takes place
without relieving him of any of his deep reality.

Other notable performances are the two leads, Claire Danes (of
ABC’s much-missed “My So-Called Life”), who will oneday rule
the world and Leonardo DiCaprio, Oscar nominee for What’s
Eating Giﬂyert Grape? They both perform well, though DiCaprio
seems just slightly, very slightly perhaps, out of his depth. Still,
whatever he lacks is more than made up for by the grand vision of
Luhrmann and his co-screenwriter Craig Pearce.

E.C., I.F.C. speak
out against hazing

Dear W&L Community,

Taylor Crothers might have
done his alma mater a favor when
he published those pictures in The
New York Times Magazine. To
be sure, the article and pictures
cast a dark shadow on our Univer-
sity. However, if we are smart,
we’ll use this dubious publicity to
our advantage. The advent of these
pictures only speaks louder to stu-
dents in telling them that the
University’s commitment to end-
ing hazing is ﬁrm.

President Elrod set the ball roll-
ing last January when he invited
the fifteen fraternity Presidents to
Lee House to ask for an end to
hazing. Then, the Board of Trust-
ees charged last year’s Student
Body President, Keith Benedict,
and Dean Atkins to author a hazing
policy. This fall, the Student Af-
fairs Committee (SAC), composed
of six students, four professors and
two deans, set out to fine-tune an
already aggressive policy that was
begun last year. The student mem-
bers who sit on SAC include the
Student Bar Association President,
Student Body President, IFC Presi-
dent, Panhellenic President, SCC
President and Head Dorm Coun-
selor. These elected officers from
all walks of W&L student life col-

laborated with members of the fac-_

ulty and administration and ap-
proved the University Policy on
Hazing which, for the first time,
makes individuals accountable for
hazing violations. By punishing
an entire fraternity for hazing, one
also punishes the pledges (the very
group this policy aims to protect).
Such punishment has proven a fail-
ure in the past.

It should be clear, then, that the
University has been at work shap-
ing this vigorous hazing policy long
before these pictures were pub-
lished. The Times piece might
well preempt any example-mak-
ing by a hazing judicial board, and
it might heat off pointless injury

resulting from hazing. What this I

article will not do is heighten or
reduce the seriousness of this
policy.

Among other things, this ag-
gressive policy allows for a judi-
cial board composed of five SAC
student members and a non-voting
faculty advisor to hear cases where
sufficient evidence of hazing has
been found after an investigation.
Clearly, SAC is giving student self-

governance a chance to work by
trusting students to solve what
amounts to be a problem for the
whole university. There has never
been an official student committee
whose sole purpose is to try indi-
viduals for hazing. In other words,
students have not yet proven that
they cannot hand down properpun-
ishment for students guilty of haz-
ing.

Hazing has become an anachro-
nism on the large majority of col-
lege campuses today. Even at a
school that holds history soidear,
most would agree that it is time for
our tradition of hazing at Wash-
ington and Lee to die. The large
majority of students are ready and
willing to make hazing a memory.
For those students who still wish to
haze, a clear message has been sent
from the faculty, administration
and fellow students through the
Student Affairs Committee: there
will be an aggressive University
policy on hazing, and it will be
enforced. It is our hope that the
faculty pass the SAC policy as it
stands.

Sincerely,
Sandy Hooper
Student Body President

Student offended
by statement
made on WLUR

Dear Editor and Fellowstudentsz

I am‘w‘riting, in all seriousness,
because I have been offended by
something I heard on our campus
radio station.

On Wednesday morning, at
about 7:45, I was listening to
WLUR. The two DJ ’s were talk-
ing about a movie, and one of them
mentioned that one of the actors
“looked like some total faggot
boy.” I’m sure that this was a
casual comment and was not meant

as an insult. Even so, I was of-
fended. Let me tell you why.

The word “faggot,” used in that
context, is akin to the word
“nigger.” Think about what would
happen if the student had made a
similar comment, using instead the
inﬂammatory N-word. Virtually
everyone at W&L would be of-
fended. The station, and the stu-
dent involved, would publicly
apologize. As it is, however, the
use of the word “faggot” at W&L

does not elicit a similar public re-
sponse. This does not mean that
the word is any less offensive to
members of this community; it sim-
ply means that few people here
have the courage to admit that such
language is profane and unneces-
sary.

The most disturbing thing about
the incident is that the student did
not apologize when I called the
station to make her aware of what
she had said, and how it had af-
fected me. She did not apologize
on the phone, nor did she mention
the call on the air in the half hour
that I listened to the show. I realize
that it was early, and that she was
probably shocked that someone
would call about a seemingly in-
significant remark, but that does
not excuse her behavior. Students
who volunteer for radio shows
should be held to the same stan-
dards of decency as are the stu-
dents who write for university pub-
lications.

The militantly anti-gay staff of
the Spectator would not allow the
word “faggot” in their publication.
Even Glenn Miller, on his back
page Trident columns, hadn’t used
the word, though I must admit he’s
been very creative (if often unsuc-
cessfully so) at coming up with
other ways to slam G&L. Clearly
this word is offensive if even the
most homophobic students at W&L
would not stoop to use it.

Please do not misunderstand my
intentions. I’m not writing to fur-
ther a leftist agenda, nor am I call-
ing for the student DJ to be pun-
ished. I think she should continue
her show, provided that she apolo-
gize for her careless mistake. I
wrote this letter because I think
that too often at this school such
behavior goes unchecked. We
pride ourselves in providing a
unique atmosphere of friendliness
and civility at W&L. Why, then,
are we so reluctant to recognize
actions which are antithetical to
those principles? We should all be
offended when such actions occur.

Sincerely,
Catherine C. Resmer

Hazing need not
be part of pledge
experience

Dear W&L Students:

The New York Times Maga-
zine piece on hazing has brought to
the surface an unpleasant fact about
our special community. Hazing is

a fact within our fraternity system
and within some of the secret soci-
eties as well.

I was first presented with hard
evidence last December and Janu-
ary when I received a number of
anonymous communications from
freshmen and parents of freshmen
alleging hazing in fraternity pledge
programs. The agreement within
these communications (letters, tele-
phone calls and one personal visit)
in the description of hazing activi-
ties testified to their veracity and
provided the basis for my convic-
tion that this problem is severe and
in need of correction.

I immediately reported my ﬁnd-
ings to the Board of Trustees at its

1996 winter meeting in Lexington '

and received its strong endorse-
ment of my request that the Ofﬁce
of the Dean of Students address
this problem by revising our haz-
ing policy and implementing steps
to prevent its re-occurrence in the
1997 rush/pledge period and there-
after.

Deans Howison and Atkins have
worked closely with the IFC, the
EC, fraternity officers and the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee to create
and implement a preventive pro-
gram this winter. They have also
established new procedures for in-
vestigating allegations of hazing
and new penalties for those found
guilty of it. The faculty will vote
on the new University Policy on
hazing at its December 2nd meet-
ing.

There has been considerable
conversation these last ten days
about hazing at Washington and
Lee. Discussion in classes, faculty
ofﬁces, fraternity houses, the fresh-
men donns, all over our campus,
and I am glad that it is so. Most, but
not all, of these conversation have
reflected an appalling regard for
these activities and a concern that
they be eradicated. Most students
have been embarrassed for their
University by the debased picture
of fraternity life displayed in the C.
Taylor Clothiers’ photographs.

My deep hope is that there ex-
ists a rising determination on your
part that hazing must be ended at
your University and that you and
your leaders in the EC, the IF C and
the fraternity chapters will simply
say “No More!” It will take a deep
and lasting resolve on your part to
bring an end to hazing and courage
too, for not all of you agree that it
is wrong and should be ended. So
for those of you who are willing to
make the effort to raise the spiri-
tual level of Washington and Lee
by bringing an end to this debased

activity, I can only promise you
my full and complete support. I
will do all that I can to assist you,
but you must know that the admin-
istration and the faculty and the
trustees and the alumni and the
press cannot end this practice alone.

What can you do? The IFC is
designing a challenging and posi-
tive pledge program which all fra-
ternities are to follow. Each chap-
ter on this campus can pledge that
it will conduct its own pledge pro-
gram according to the IFC guide-
lines. Chapter presidents and
pledge trainers can vow that haz-
ing will not occur in their chapters
and can closely monitor the pledg-
ing activities of their new classes.
Sophomores can resist the long-
standing principle that “It was done
to me, and I am going to do it to
them.” Juniors and seniors can
exercise the authority which falls
to them as upperclassmen to insist
that IFC guidelines be followed
and can use their inﬂuence to dis-
suade individuals who are inclined
to haze. Pledges can collectively
and individually resist hazing if
their fraternities engage in it, re-
membering as you must that it is
wrong. And pledges and brothers
alike can take the courageous step
of informing the Dean of Students
Office if hazing activities occur.
And every student on this campus
can and should bear in mind that
hazing is inconsistent with both
the values of honor and civility
that define Washington and Lee
University.

You should know that I am a
Sigma Nu. I spent three wonderful
years in the Zeta Theta Chapter of
this fraternity at Presbyterian Col-
lege. I was not hazed; and I am
certain that my bonding experi-
ence with my fellow pledges and
brothers was as strong as it could
be. I had a wonderful opportunity
to serve as faculty advisor to the
Sigma Nu Chapter here. So I am
perfectly well aware of the rich
potential of fraternities to create
lasting friendships, to provide
ample and meaningful opportuni-
ties for leadership development, to
amplify occasions for service to
the University and the community
and to provide a place for an active
social life. Fraternities have a long
and historic place in the life of this
institution. No one whom I know
of wants to bring an end to this
long and historic association be-
tween national fraternities and
Washington and Lee University.

I write this letter to inform you
of my very deep concern about
hazing at our University. I worry

NOVEMBER 15, 1996

that it is eroding the integrity of
Washington and Lee and that it

will damage the reputation of this L

fine university as well. I want you
to know that the Trustees, the fac-

ulty and the administration are op- A ; .
posed to this activity and will do '
whatever we can to bring this prac- .
ticetoan end. Iask that youjoin us '
as partners in this endeavor. I 2

cannot help believe that if you re-

flect upon the ideals of honor and ‘
civility that constitute the moral,

cornerstones of Washington and

Lee University, you will insist that I
this practice come to an end and;

will see that it does so.

From start to finish, your
continuous supoprt has proven
itself fruitful as the letters and
notes of thanks and congratu-
lations continue to be received.
There are too many of you to
mention individually in the
space allotted me here, but rest
assured that the conference's
success can be only attributed
to genuine team effort and ac-
ceptance of responsibility.

As Director of the Tucker

to hold a grand place in the
domain of language teaching
technologies. But it is all of
you who have helped to put us
there for which I personally
thank you!

Emory & Henry

W&L loses 14-0
lead as Wasps win
third straight title

BY Sccrrr BOOKWALTER
PHI Sronrs EDrroR

 

For one quarter, the Washington and
Lee football team had defending ODAC
champion Emory & Henry right where it
wanted. '

An shocking upset and a chance for
the ODAC title appeared within the Gen-
erals’ grasp. But then the Wasps’ J.D.
Davis revved up his engine and reality
began to sink in for
the Generals.

Emory & Henry
erased a 14-0 defi-
cit by reeling off 29
consecutive points
en route to a 43-27
victory over the
Generals at Wilson
Field Saturday af-
ternoon.

The Wasps’ vic-
tory gave them their third straight ODAC
title. Since Randolph-Macon lost to

Bridgewater, a Generals victory over the
Wasps would have given W&L its first
title since 1985.

Still, the Generals performed very
admirably against a team that had beaten
them 13 straight times, mostly in blow-
outs.

“I was proud that the team came ready
to play from the ﬁrst snap,” senior quar-
terback Brooks Fischer said. ‘‘I can re-
member times over the last four years
when guys were intimidated by playing
Emory & Henry On Saturday there was
no fear-everyone felt that way.”

The Generals played anything but
scared. One minute into the second quar-
ter, W&L looked more like the team that
had won two straight titles.

After a missed field goal on W&L’s
first drive, senior wideout Tommy Rueger
gave the Generals an early 7-0 lead on an
11-yard touchdown pass from Fischer
with 3:46 left in the first quarter. The
score was set up when sophomore Ben
Middendorf recovered an E&H fumbled
punt return at the W&L 47.

Rueger and Fischer then switched
places on W&L’s next drive. On an odd
double pass play, Fischerthrew to Rueger
in the backﬁeld, who then threw back
across the ﬁeld to Fischer, who scam-
pered 19 yards into the end zone for a rare

touchdown reception.

“Catching the touchdown pass from
Tommy was one ofthose plays that I will
always remember,” Fischer said. “As a
quarterback, you always want to catch a
pass because it makes you feel more like
an athlete.”

The Generals now led the Wasps 14-
0 with 16 seconds gone in the second
quarter and looked to pour it on. But they
would never get the opportunity. Emory
& Henry got its ground game churning
and began driving downfield at will.

The Wasps’ onslaught began on
Jimmie Clark’s leaping 29-yard touch-
down reception from quarterback Aaron
Brand to make it 14-6. The PAT was
blocked, but E&H came right back with
the first of three J.D. Davis touchdown
runs, a 6-yard dash, with 8:38 remaining
in the half.

The two-point attempt failed, leaving
the score at 14-12, but the Wasps finally
caught up to the Generals on a safety with
3:37 left. Following the free kick, E&H
marched downfield once again. Another
Davis TD run, this time from 11 yards
out, gave the Wasps a 21-14 advantage at
halftime.

The Generals had to contend with the
elements as sleet and snow ﬁurries fell
and the wind picked up in the second
half,butdealingwiththeweatherseemed
easier than dealing with Davis.

The Wasps’ running back ran
roughshod over the Generals for an E&H
school record 288 yards rushing on an
amazing 40 attempts. Davis’sthird touch-
down of the day, a 4-yard run, gave the
Wasps a 29-14 margin four minutes into
the half.

W&L then mounted a ﬁnal charge,
awakening the crowd with a four-play
57-yard drive, capped by a 4-yard Seth
McKinley touchdown run to close within
29-20 at the 5:04 mark in the third quar-
ter.

But Emory & Henry refused to wilt,
and it regained control in the fourth quar-
ter. Brand scored on a 2-yard plunge and
Shane Tucker added a 4-yard run, ex-
tending the lead to 43-20 and sealing
another league title for the Wasps.

McKinley scored his career-high sixth
touchdown of the season with 45 seconds
left to cap the scoring.

Unlike its 132 yards in total offense
one week ago at Bridgewater, the Gener-
als’ offense was not a problem this past
Saturday.

The offense turned in its best perfor-
mance of the season with 361 total yards,
but the defense was steamrolled for 492

yards against the Wasps, including 397-

on the ground to Davis and Co. Brand,
meanwhile, completed only three passes

for the Wasps.

Fischer, on the other hand, became
the Generals’ all—time passing leaderwith
an 18 for 27 effort for a season—high 211
yards. The senior from Atlanta now
holds school records in yards (4,600),
completions (441), and is now only one
touchdown pass away from tying Phillip
Sampson’s (1986-89) record of 32.

“It’s difﬁcult tothink about the record
right now, partly because the loss to
Emory still hurts,” Fischer said, “but also
because we still have one more game to
win. The team’s success is much more
important to me. I would trade some
more wins for any record.”

Junior receiver Nick Hodge also had a
huge day for the Generals on offense,
catching six of Fischer’s passes for a
career-best 159 yards. SeniorJ on Gardner
hauled in four passes for 36 yards, giving
him the most receptions (26) for a W&L
tight end since 1989.

Sophomore Floyd Young led the Gen-
erals’ ground effort with 6 rushes for 28
yards.

The W&L defense spent a lot of time
on the ﬁeld as E&H controlled the ball
for more than 36 minutes, but senior
linebacker McGuire Boyd made the best
of it with 16 tackles, including a season-
high 8 solo stops. Boyd now has 114
tackles on the season, the highest for a
W&L player in five years. Sophomore
Trey Carr added nine tackles while se-

rushes past Generals

nior Chris Watson and junior Matt Luka
had eight.

The 4-5 Generals will look to end
their season on a winning note and close
their season with four wins in five games
for the third straight year as they travel to
winless Swarthmore (0-9) tomorrow. The
Garnet Tide’s defense has been a wash-
out this season, yielding an average of
39.6 points per game.

The Generals, however, are not tak-
ing Swarthmore lightly. Last year, the
Garnet Tide prevailed 2-0 in the infa-
mous Mud Bowl on Wilson Field. The
previous year, the Generals turned ﬁve
Garnet Tide turnovers into a 14-11 vic-
tory at Swarthmore. The teams’ only
other meeting came back in 1914, a 10-0
W&L victory in Norfolk.

“The scariest thing about Swarthmore
is that they are 0-9,” Fischer said, adding
that the Garnet Tide is talented, but young
at some key positions. “We are good, but
not good enough to take any team lightly.
We remember well that they spoiled our
season last year.”

A win would give the Generals three
straight .500 orbetter seasons since 1988-
90 and would make head coach Frank
Miriello the‘ fastest to 10 career victories’
since George Barclay in 1949-50.

“Hopefully we can show up with the
same intensity as last Saturday,” Fischer
said. “If we do that, good things should
happen.”

FINANCIAL AID GETS BOOST:

The $1] million gift of Texas millionaire and former W&L
student James Dye will be used in part to expand financial aid,
the Board of Trustees recently decided.

Dye was a student at W&Lfor two years, starting in 1930, but
left due to poor grades and too much socializing at the Sigma
Chi house. He also left the University of Texas after a short stay,
and was employed by his father, one of the richest oil executives
in the Southwest.

His fond memories of the Honor System, speaking tradition
and fraternity life at W&L prompted him to contact the director
of planned gifts in 1991, and his gift of $6 million dollars plus
half of the remainder of the residual estate was made upon his
death in May of 1995, making Dye the second largest gift-giver
in W&L history.

The outright gift of $6 million will be devoted to financial
aid, said President Elrod.

Upperclassmen left out in the cold

HAC revamps housing policy

BY HILLARY COOMBS
PHI MANAGING EDITOR

Current residents of university housing will soon
ﬁnd a letter from the Housing Advisory Committee in
their mailboxes.

Why? To inform them that “The Housing committee
voted unanimously to give rising sophomores prefer-
ence for housing in Gaines Hall since sophomores are
required to live in university housing.”

The Student Body Executive Committee appointed
the committee to work with Dean of Freshmen and
Residence Life Dennis Manning “to help formulate
housing policies that will be fair to all students.”

“We’ve been discussing [the policy change] for a
while,” Dean Manning stated. “We reached a decision
before Thanksgiving.”

The dean’s office has been working since then to get
a letter out announcing the committee’s decision.

“There was no conspiracy to keep this until the
newspapers weren’t coming out,” Manningcommented.
“We wanted to make as informed and circumspect a
decision as possible.”

Why change the policy?

“Since the university requires that sophomores live
in university housing, it has to make the accommoda-
tion of the sophomores its first priority in the lottery
process,” committee member Nate Tencza explained.
“lt’s also valuable to designate an area that will be
recognized as a sophomore area and help maintain the
class unity.”

How, exactly, will the plan be implemented?

“We’re still working through the mechanics of the

lotteries,” Manning noted. He did confirm, however,
that the current plan is for any sophomores who do not
win suites in Gaines to be placed in Woods Creek.

“We will deﬁnitely have a sophomore presence in
Woods Creek, but I wouldn’t say in large numbers,”
Manning continued. ‘‘I wish I could forecast that.”

Both the dean and committee members cite the new
policy of men’s winter rush as making it difficult to
discern the number of sophomores who will desire to
live in Gaines.

‘‘It’s also a major factor in the decision that the class
sizes are getting larger, and we don’t know how rush is
going to go this year,” Tencza stated. “There are a lot
of variables that accounted for the decision.”

Tencza and Dean Manning admit that the committee
did discuss the effects of the hazing controversy on the
situation “very indirectly,” in Dean Manning’s words.
They agreed with committee member Sarah Saalﬁeld,
however, that “the hazing thing wasn’t a factor [in our
decision].’’

As for upperclassmen, they “will receive ﬁrst pref-
erence for apartments in Woods Creek,” the letter
continues. “However, the university cannot guarantee
the availability of housing for upperclassmen.”

“With the increasing numbers of students that will
be admitted over the course of the next several years,
some decisions had to be made about housing,”
Catherine Ruth Felton explained the committee’s deci-
ston.

‘‘I think that in the short vision of it people are going
to think it’s a pain, but in the long term it’s something
people are going to have to get used to,” Tencza
concluded.

Sororities help
Santa Claus

BY KELLEY ToTrEN
PHI STAFF WRITER

Students are contributing more to the Rockbridge
County community during the Christmas season than
the noise violations from their Christmas Parties.

Pi Beta Pi sorority is sponsoring the Salvation Army
Angel Tree at W&L, giving students the opportunity to
give presents to needy children in the community.

“Christmas seems to bring out a feeling of good will
in people,” said coordinator Erin Rosencrans. “We are
going to a university that is not cheap and getting a good
education. I think the students realize how fortunate we
are and want to do something for the kids in the
community who don’t have even half the opportunites.”

Sorority members have been sitting outside the Co-
op all this week handing out gift cards. The cards
contain the age, sex, clothing sizes, and requested gifts
and toys of each child. Volunteers choose the kid they
want, purchase toys and/or clothes, and then bring their
presents back to the Co-op.

Pi Phi members will be outside the Co-op again next
week to hand out any remaining cards and to pick up the
gifts. All the gifts will be returned by Friday, Dec. 13
and then distributed to the kids.

Some students are signing up to buy gifts together.
“We both don’t have a lot of money, but we really
wanted to do it,” said senior Maggie George who is
participating with junior Frank Vitale.

George and Vitale chose a 20-month-old girl and
plan to buy her Sesame Street’s “Tickle—Me” Elmo doll

. and.some,glothes. .

Last§yeéi:siW&L had 75 children on its Angel Tree
and Rosencrans wanted to increase that number to 100
this year. But because of the high demand from other
organizations in the community to participate,
Rosencrans was only able to get 50 cards.

The kids’ ages range from 8 months to 11 years and
their toy requests include everything from computers
and bikes to puzzles and makeup.

“I think there are going to be some disappointed kids
because a lot of them asked for Super Nintendos and
remote control cars,” junior Greg,Chow said.

When asked what he was buying, though, Chow
indicated that his boy probably won’t be disappointed.

“l’ll get him something extravagent and expensive,”
he said.

Senior Chad Sartini chose a six—year-old boy be-
cause, like Sartini, the boy is a Washington Redskins
football fan. Sartini hopes to find a Redskins’ jacket or
sweatshirt.

“It’s a viable way for us to get involved,” Sartini
said. “We can make some kids’ Christmas a little

Candlelight Service on Thursday, Dec.
12, at 8 pm in Lee Chapel.

This is a Service of Nine Lessons
and Carols that tell the story of biblical
history from the Creation to the Incar-
nation.

The University Chamber Singers,
directed by Gordon Spice, will provide
carols, and Professor of music Timo-
thy Gaylard is the featured organist.

Angela Matney, a senior and a
Chamber Singer, says, ‘‘I'm really ex-
cited about this year’s repertoire. it’s
even better than last year’s.”

According to Matney, the service
will include several beautiful songs
that are outside the mainstream of tra-
ditional Christmas music, songs that
most people haven’t heard before.

As is customary, readers for the
service will be chosen from the univer-
sity community. Acting University
Chaplin Thomas Litzenburg, Jr. will
preside over the service.

public in Lee Chapel.

Lee’s glasses
return to W&L

Robert E. Lee’s eyeglasses from
early in his military career will now
be displayed along with his other be-
longings in the Lee Chapel Museum.

The eyeglasses have been in the
possession of the Edgar L. Krotee
family of Baltimore, Md. since Mr.
Krotee’s grandfather, Benjamin
Lewis Krotee, was given permission
to remove them from a house which
he was cleaning out for the Baltimore
Waterworks 73 years ago. The house
was soon after demolished.

The Krotees were convinced by
their friend, W&L alum P. James
Kurapka, to donate the glasses to the
University.

The eyeglasses are in a black
leather case. lnsidethe case reads the
inscription: Robert E. Lee, US Ma-
rine Hospt, No. 21, Stapleton Staten

ington & Lee community.

In his memory, his parents created the
David Thompson Endowment fund to
sponsor educational programming in re-
lation to alcohol use at W&L. The ﬁrst in
the series brought Brian Smith’s and Bill
Ross’s “Last Call... A Sobering Look at
Alcohol Abuse” presentation to campus
last Tuesday.

Their presentation consisted of short
skits in which different aspects of alcohol
abuse were illustrated. One was a humor-
ous rendition of a field sobriety test in
which the officer, played by Smith, made
Ross balance a unicycle on his head. As
the evening progressed, the skits became
more serious, dealing with subjects such
as date rape.

Acting aside, Ross and Smith told sto-
ries of their experiences with alcohol and
substance abuse. Near the end of the

program, the two recited an array of alco-
hol abuse statistics, keeping the audience’s
attention by interchangeably juggling 6
knives at once.

DECEMBER 6, 1996

Student autonomy is threatened by faculty distrust

Life on the Hill
C. E. Miller ’98

The faculty here doesn’t seem to be-
lieve in the long-standing tradition of stu-
dent autonomy. We sent a petition to the
faculty asking that a board of five students
be created to deal with hazing. The faculty
found the proposal too risky, too unstable,
without precedence and ‘lacking faculty
control, so they amended the proposal.
Now we have a hazing committee, much
like many of the other committees on
campus. There will be three student rep-
resentatives, and three faculty members
on the board. Just for your information,
The Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee has two student representa-
tives, and The Radiation Safety commit-
tee gets one student representative. (I didn’t

even know we had a Radiation Safety
Committee, but y’all are doing a great job
I can safely say I don’t fear radiation
poisoning.)

I know everyone is sick to death of the
hazing thing, but we cannot let it become
a cover for the eradication of student au-
tonomy at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity. The reasons stated at this faculty
meeting for not allowing the proposal to
pass as presented were numerous. Many
professors felt that students haven’t in the
past dealt effectively with hazing, and
sticking five of us on a board wasn’t likely
to increase action. That is where they are
wrong, we need that power, we need to
feel like we are taking charge of our prob-
lems. I "don’t think that the new faculty
members are being hazed by their depart-
ment heads, so it faculty hazing isn’t an
issue they deal with everyday.

There was concern voiced that an all
student committee would not objectively

look at individual cases. I could see con-
cern if the punishment was enacted upon a
particular house or sorority, but the recent
hazing policy moves the blame from the
group to the individual. This is much
closer to the honor system that requires
speciﬁc punishment for specific action.

Faculty members felt that electing a
student board would be difficult because
of the constant change in members. There
would be no continuance in thought, stu-
dents elected now might feel differently
about the issue than those elected in five
years. Somehow a justification was made
for faculty members to be on the board to
create a static nature. Quite an argument,
but what about the honor system? There is
a great amount of ﬂux in the members of
the Executive Committee but no com-
plaints about this upheaval interfering in
the decision making process.

So what if we did make a mistake, what
if someone wasn’t really happy with the

decision made? Believe it or not there is
an appellate process goes right-to the presi-
dent, and then he can decide if we the
students did our job fairly and accurately.
Why have the faculty members interfere?
Many of the younger faculty who were
hired on their freshness seem to not under-
stand the traditions at Washington and
Lee University.

I Speaking of new faculty, how are they
introduced to the traditions here at Wash-
ington and Lee? Are they asked to attend
the Honor System meeting mandatory to
all freshmen? Does their department head
take them aside and encourage them to
read that little white book from cover to
cover? Do they sign cards pledging their
honor to the university? Do they speak
with their peers on the merits of continu-
ing the speaking tradition? Are they in-
formed by department heads about our
unusual exam policy? I don’t know how
much training they receive in these im-

’Twas the Night Before Christmas

portant areas, but I do know of new fac-
ulty who are unfamiliar with what is al-
lowed and not allowed under the Honor
Code. Ifthey have questions about such a
simple policy, it is no wonder that the
faculty as a whole voted to deny us our
autonomy. .

I want trust, I want to be treated
like an adult, not a child requiring
supervision to cross the street. This is
not just your university, it is mine, I
help pay the bills, I was sad and upset
to learn that my peers were being
hurt, and I want to do something about
it. What I don’t want is supervision,
please trust me.

To the faculty: please stop going
above your student’s heads when you
feel it is too much for us to handle.
You imposed winter rush, and now
your tentacles have wrapped around
hazing, what will be the next to go?

Christmas in Bosnia: grab your gun

From.-the Right

I Jason Zacher ’98

The Ring-tum Phi Editorial Editor

Since the ﬁghting ended a year
ago, Bosnia has held onto a fragile
peace. Periodically, this “peace”
has heated up, but for the most
part, things are quiet.

The bi ggest reason for this is the
multinational force consisting of
the United States, Britain, France,
and Russia. Bill Clinton had prom-
ised that our troops would be home
for Christmas, but now that prom-
ise, like so many others, has faded
into memory. The Clinton admin-
istration tells us that of our 14,000
troops currently in Bosnia, 8,000
troops are going to stay until March.
NATO tells a different story. They
tell us that the United States will be
providing 10,000 troops that are
staying “well into 1998.”

The NATO Secretary General,
Javier Sloana, said recently that
NATO is considering keeping a
military force in Bosnia to keep the

peace. Richard Holbrooke, the US
diplomat that negotiated the peace
agreement, is urging Clinton to
keep troops in Bosnia, so the civil
war will not start again.

Bosnia is about to embark on
another dangerous step towards
peace, the repatriation of the refu-
gees. In the year since the fighting
ended, few refugees have made it
back to their homes. Under the
Dayton peace agreement, all refu-
gees will be allowed to return home,
but this is easier said then done.
The multinational force is strug-
gling to keep the sides apart, which
will be nearly impossible once all
the refugees return.

The Serbians are yet again stand-
ing in the way of true peace. A few
weeks ago, Muslim refugees and
Serbian police traded gunfire, and
only a ﬂood of American and Rus-
sian helicopters and armored ve-
hicles could stop it. The Serbs
claim that the returning Muslims
are armed, and taking back terri-
tory the Serbs won in the war. The
Muslims only want to return home,
and say they only signed the agree-

dent.

ment because they could return.

Two problems remain in Bosnia. . ,

First is the tremendous desire for
all sides to return to their homes.
They will probably not find much
to come home to, but the desire is
still strong. Second is history.
These three factions, the Croatians,
the Muslims, and the Serbians, have
been trading gunfire, spears, rocks,
and insults for centuries. There
have been a few periods of relative
peace in the region, when strong
governments or military forces sit
on them. The Ottomans and the
Communists are perfect examples.
When they are not being smoth-
ered, they are fighting each other.
So where am I going with this?
Bill Clinton had the right idea by
sending troops to Bosnia, but the
time is going to come when it will
not make any difference who is
there. America is continuing to be
the world’s policeman." This is
reinforced by the idea to send troops
to Zaire (yet another tribal massa-
cre). If NATO pulls out in March,
Bosnia is going to plunge into civil
war again. All parties involved are
going to return to their homes, and
their pre-war places, and this first
war will probably be only a dress
rehearsal for what is to come.
Why will it be worse? Well, 67
of the 74 indicted war criminals
are still at-large, and no one seems
to want to catch them. This war
sparked hatred and resentment that
has not been seen since Nazi Ger-
many, but he only difference is
after World War II, the leaders
were apprehended or removed from
power. We have no such luck in
Bosnia. Any leaders that do Offl-
cially step down you can bet are

not retiring.
jlngtvhej city Of Pr‘-ij_ed_o__r, there
were 40,000 Muslim and 40,000
Serb residents before the war.
Currently, only a few hundred Mus-
lims remain. The rest are in the
nearby city of Sanski Most. What
is going to happen when those
40,000 Muslims return to find the
40,000 Serbs that drove them
away? I do not think there will be
a town carnival.

This war is far from over. The
sides have fought each other for so
long that nobody has any idea what

 . . neither side
has any idea
what they are

ﬁghting for:
They simply
hate each
other: ”

they are fighting for. They simply
hate each other, and hate is a tre-
mendous emotion for anyone to
overcome, especially a third party.

What are the solutions? Who
knows. Only two things will work:
installing a dictator that will sit on
them, or letting the sides fight it
out until they get sick. There is no
solution. American public opin-
ion will not allow out troops to stay
there indefinitely, and public opin-
ion will not let us let them kill each
other.

Mr. President, I will be praying
for you and the Bosnians.

These last two weeks of classes
are probably the ones most packed
with work of the entire term. Talk
to anyone on campus, and they can
quickly rattle off an array of tests,
papers, presentations, group
projects, meetings, speeches, and
studying that they need to get done.
I’m in the same boat. But lately,
the busier I am, the more aware I
am of how easily I’m distracted.

Imagine yourself sitting down
in front of the computer to get
cracking on something important,
be it a paper, or in my case, a
column. Oh, but it’s 5:00. I’ve
been working hard lately; what
better waypto reward gnyselfihan
watching Oprah for anehour? I
think Oprah is the coolest. She has
shows on really fun things, like
how much it actually costs to make
a lipstick, or what dress her best
friend Gail should wear to the Os-
cars, or how to pick out the right
frames for your pictures. I always
end up sucked in.

Then after that, The Simpsons
are on, and really, it’s such an
intelligently written show that I
really am expanding my mind by
watching it. Next thing you know,
it’s midnight and you’re ﬂipping
back and forth between an
infomercial where they set a car on
fire to shoe how great the car wax
is, and a marathon of The Real
World on MTV, wondering is J oe’s
girlfriend is actually a man. You
know you’ve been there.

The next day, though, you’re
really going to do work, and you sit
down at the computer again. But
you sneeze and realize you are out
of Kleenex. A Wal-Mart run is in
order, but just to get the tissues,
then you are right back to work.
Well, maybe not. Because they
usually have really good prices on
chips, so you should probably pick
up some snack food (you know,
for studying). And hadn’t you
been needing a new shoe rack for
your closet?

And while you’re here, maybe
there are some new CD5 out. Ooh,
and there an article in People that
looks really good. . . you should
pick that up. And you know there
is a whole section of Wal-Mart of
different scents of air fresheners?
You end up spending half and hour

there, wondering if green apple or
peach is best suited to your par-
ticular car/sense of style. Then
you make the mistake of wander-
ing into the section of Christmas
decoration and remember that you
haven’t done any Christmas shop-
ping yet. . . so there’s another day,
wasted.

But now, you are cracking down.
It’s really time to work, and you
are serious. But is your desk al-
ways this dusty? Come and think
of it, when is the last time you
cleaned your room? And the bath-
tub really needs some work. Now
that you have that new shoe rack,
you should probably put that up.
And now you feel so organized
that it’s time to alphabetize your
CDs.

Okay, so youriook a little time ,
« away from-doing work. ,But your
place looks great. Mom ,would be ‘

proud. In fact, why not call and tell
her. There goes another day.
Morning comes. There is now
no way you can possibly do work
and attend class, so you decide to
skip all your classes and stay home
doing work. But since you are
kind of taking the day off, you
sleep late and wake up at 10. And
hey, Rosie O’Donnel’s show is on!
She’s right up there with Oprah in

coolness. You’ve got to love any
talk show host who is as star struck

as you would be if you got to meet
Tom Cruise. So you watch Rosie
throw Koosh balls at her guests
and sing TV theme songs and. . .
hey, it’s time for lunch.

Your roommate convinces you
to go out to lunch, you get talking,
and the next thing you know, it’s
two in the afternoon. This time,
you actually sit down at your com-
puter and write two pages of your
paper. Woo-hoo! Time to cel-
ebrate by taking a nap! Your last
thoughts as you drift off to sleep
are, “Maybe I should set my alarm.”

Woah, if you don’t get some
work done soon, you will be to-
tally screwed. Time to go to the
library and get serious. But first,
you should check your e-mail. And
do a quick skim of USA Today
since your professors are always
griping about the poor knowledge
W&L students have of current
events. Then a friend wanders by,
and the next thing you know you ’re
eating frozen yogurt at the Co-op
(oops, I mean Snack Bar Express).

is it break yet?

Men’s basketball ready for rematch with Keydets

Team suffers tough
OT defeat to H—SC;
prepares for VMI

BY BETHANY BAUMAN
Pm Sroms EDITOR

The Generals took another
step toward overcoming their
growing pains on Wednesday
when they almost handed
Hampden—Sydney an upset.

Washington and Lee looked
as if it would come away from
its ﬁrst Old Dominion Athletic
Conference matchup of the sea-
son with a victory over one of
the league’s strongest teams.

Freshman Matt Jackson
scored 15 first-half points, in-
cluding a three-pointer with less
than ﬁve seconds left in the half,

   f=?-é vThi.S;»¥‘?°!ildliéihédéﬁnit

unﬁt». but be

 

to give W&L the 37-35 lead
going into the break.

The Generals continued to
keep it close throughout the sec-
ond half. They had a 75-64 lead
with just under three minutes
left in regulation. But then
Hampden-Sydney’s Chris Fox
scored eight straight points, in-
cluding two three-pointers, to
cut W&L’s lead to 75-72. Fresh-
man center Rich Peterson
knocked one in to put the Gener-
als up by five. The Tigers an-
swered with a three-pointer and
Fox added a break-away layup
to tie the score at 77, sending the
game into overtime.

Hampden-Sydney came out
aggressively and sank the first
bucket in OT. Then Fox added
another three-pointer to put the
Tigers up by ﬁve. From there
the Generals never got within
two. Hampden—Sydney re-

mained undefeated as the Gen-
erals fell 91-87.

Peterson had a great perfor-
mance with 17 points and eight
rebounds. He scored 14 of the
Generals’ ﬁnal 18 points, in-
cluding seven of ten in OT.

W&L’s record now stands at
1-4. But all four losses have
come at an average of only 6.5
points. This is quite a change
from last year’s 3-21 squad that
held the title of worst rebound-
ing team and worst ﬁeld goal
percentage defense in‘ the
ODAC.

Last year head coach Kevin
Moore did not have the depth on
his squad to run the up-tempo
style of play that he wanted. But
after bringing in a talented re-
cruiting class nine freshmen
strong, Moore said, “We’re not
having that problem this year at
all. We’re pressing as much as
we can and keeping the tempo
going.”

Moore has three members of
the Class of 2000 in his starting
line-up; Peterson, Brian Ricketts
and Walt Pyler. Rounding out
the starting five are this year’s
co—captai ns, senior Chris Couzen
and junior Kelly Dyer.

Despite the losses and the
level of inexperienceon his team,
Moore is encouraged by what he
has seen so far. “There are some
growing pains that we’re going
through right now. I think all
and all we’re playing pretty
hard,” he said, “I like what I
see.”

The Generals are preparing
to play back-to-back games this
Friday and Saturday. On Friday

contest of the season against

to the Tigers in overtime, 91-87 . The men’s team will take a 1-4 record into VMI’s Cameron Hall Saturday.

Center is at 7:30 p.m.

The Generals won’t be on
their home court on Saturday,
but they’ll only be aboutahalfa
mile away. Virginia Military
lnstitute’s Cameron Hall will be
the sight for the third-ever meet-
ing on the hardwood between
the Keydets and the Generals.
The neighbors renewed their
basketball rivalry last season
after a 54-year hiatus. That
game, pitting Division I against
Division III, drew the second

largest crowd in Cameron Hall
history with over 4,000 people
attending.

Last year’s game was a dis-
appointing one for Moore’s
squad. The Generals only had a
seven—point deficit to make up
at the start of the second half, but
ended up dropping the game to
the Keydets, 100-62.

Moore is hoping for a differ-
ent outcome this time. “Obvi-
ously we’ll be much more com-
petitive,’ he said, “I think we did

a nice job for 20 minutes last
year against them and then just
ran out ofsteam. Ithinkwith our
added depth this year we can
sustain our level of competitive-
ness.”

W&L is going to need to be
competitive. The Keydets have
gotten off to a great start this
season with a 3-2 record so far.
Their only major loss has come
at the hands of Division I-A pow-
erhouse Wake Forest. The
Keydets were also defeated by

Navy, 68-62, on Thursday night.

VMI also has its own share of
talented freshmen in Aaron"
Demory and Eric Mann. The
Keydets also boast last year’s

Southern Conference Freshman

of the Year, Brent Conley.

No matter the outcome of
Saturday’s game, it will be a
great one for the community.
All of the proceeds from ticket
sales will go to the Rockbridge
Area Recreational Organization
to support youth athletics.

Young talent leads women into season

Generals enter
league season
with 2-2 record

BY Scorrr BOOKWALTER
PHI Sroms EDITOR

The pieces are there for the Washing-
ton and Lee women’s basketball team.
Now it is a question of how well they can
put them together.

The Generals could be hindered by a
lack of experience this season with five
freshmen and four sophomores on the
roster, but there is no denying theirtalent.
Through the first four games this year,
the young talent is already showing signs
of maturity, making an improvement on
last year’s 5-18 record appear likely.

W&L began its 1996-97 season by
traveling to Pittsburgh November 22-23,
‘where it split two games in the Carnegie
Mellon Tip-Off Tournament. The Gen-
erals had the misfortune of drawing de-
fending Division III runner-up Mount
Union in the opener, as the Generals
were routed, 85-46. But the women
salvaged third place in the tournament by
outlasting Thiel, 46-43.

“Against Mount Union, we played
well for the first eight minutes,” junior
captain Tonia Dean said. “After that,
they outran us. They were just a more

athletic team and overall, a better team.”

The Generals led 12-10 with about 14
minutes remaining in the ﬁrst half, but
that would be the last lead they would
see. Mount Union roared out on 38-10
run during the remainder of the half,
giving it a commanding 48-22 advantage
at halftime. -

W&L scored the first four points of
the second half but then went the next 5
1/2 minutes without scoring as Mount
Union pulled away.

Freshman guard Jessica Morton made
a big splash in her first game by leading
the Generals with 14 points. Another
newcomer to the team, senior Elizabeth
Bahn, hauled down 11 rebounds, while
Dean grabbed nine boards.

W&L returned to the court for the
consolation game and slogged its way
past Thiel. Thiel led 41-40 with 4:10
remaining in the game, but Morton then
took command. She scored W&L’s ﬁnal
six points to give the team its first win of
the season.

Morton notched 14 for the second
straight game, earning her a spot on the
all-tournament team. Fellow freshman
guard Ansley Miller also collected 14
points for the Generals.

The Generals continued to receive
outstanding play from their cadre of
young players in their 69-29 hammering
of Villa Julie last Tuesday, which in-
creased their record to 2-1.

Miller had an unbelievable game as
she set a new school record for steals in
one game with 11. She also racked up 19
points, eight rebounds and eight assists,

Diving ahead

The W&L women’s swimming team has splashed out to a 4-1 record this
season after two victories this week, 102-39 vs. Randolph-Macon Woman’s
College Tuesday and 121-59 at Sweet Briar Wednesday. W&L set seven meet
records against RMWC and now has won 27 straight ODAC dual meets.

just missing a quadruple-double.

Morton added 15 more points and
seven assists, while Dean and sopho-
more Chrissy Burghardt grabbed 13 and
11 rebounds, respectively. A stiﬂing
W&L defense forced 32 turnovers, and
an outmatched Villa Julie team shot a
miserable 28 percent from the field.

Despite the W&L rout, Dean said the
Generals still could have played better.

“We didn’t play to our potential at
all,” she said. “We settled for a comfort-
able lead and didn’t do the things we
needed to do to get better. It was a win,
but it was not as big as it should have
been.”

The Generals were back in action
Thursday night to tip off their Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference season, but
they suffered a heartbreaking 71-70 de-
feat in overtime at Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College.

W&L jumped out to an 11-3 lead
early in the first half and led 32-28 at
halftime. The outlook looked good for a
third Generals win in four games, but
RMWC had other ideas. RMWC grabbed
the lead back in the second half, before
Dean converted a bankshot with 11 sec-
onds left in regulation to tie the score and
force overtime.

The Generals edged back in front 70-
69 in overtime, but RMWC’s Jean
Hazelwood spoiled the possible W&L
victory by connecting on a short jumper
with 7.6 seconds remaining. A last-ditch
W&L jumpshot was off the mark and
RMWC (5-0) prevailed.

Morton again was the Generals’ high

scorer with 17 points. Miller pitched in
14 points, and sophomore center Amber
Hinkle and Dean added 12 and 10 points,
respectively.

Dean will anchor the Generals’
frontcourt this season. The frontcourt
lost scoringand reboundingleader Sandra
Holmes to graduation, but Dean, along
with Hinkle, who led the team with 36
blocks last year, will try to fill the void.

“We have good post players,” Dean
said. “If we could just get our footwork
down, then the rest will fall into place.”

With the team’s strong dcoth in the
backcourt, however, the team will rely
more on Dean and the other post players
to provide defense instead of scoring.

“My personal goal is to be a great
rebounder,” Dean said. “That’s my job
out there. Our guards and other players
can score the big points and I can pull
down the boards.”

Besides the talented frosh tandem of
Morton and Miller, the Generals will rely
on sophomores Burghardt and Karin
Treese for scoring. Burghardt, who plays
both guard and forward, averaged 11
points per game last season. Point guard
Treese averaged 7.6 points per game last
season while dishing out 34 assists.

Freshmen Stephanie Leffler,
Stephanie McKnight and Denise Wallin
could also provide some points off the
bench.

The Generals next play at home Sat-
urday against Guilford, which Dean said
should be a fast-paced game.

“We’ll give it our best and see what
the outcome is.”

Students voice opinions on gays

G&L President Christensen debates
critic Miller on role of organization

BY AARON FOLDENAUER
PHI STAFF WRITER

Glenn Miller consistently attacked
Alex Christensen’s Gay and Lesbian or-
ganization. Christensen had enough.

Openly gay Christensen, founder of
the privately funded G&L, refused to sit
on his hands. He called Miller out—to a
one-on-one public debate, held last
Wednesday in the Northern Auditorium.

Anti-gay signs such as “Cheer for the
Queer! Go Alex!” were posted around
campus the day of the debate.

The auditorium was packed, with
people standing along the walls and sit-
ting in the ailses. Christensen came out
swinging at Miller.

“We don’t practice promiscuity at our

  

secret meetings. We don’t endorse weird
sex. We don’t do any ofthis crap that you

Christensen’s recurring question to
Miller was, “Why do you insist in being
funny about me?”

Miller responded that he said what he
did for entertainment purposes and it was
“so out there, so ridiculous, that nobody
could possibly take it seriously.”

“Believeitor notAlex,”Miller added,
“most people on campus truly cannot and
do not take your group seriously.”

As for the role G&L should play on
campus, Miller called most ofwhat G&L
does “praiseworthy.”

eoffrey Brian Baker, a 22-year-old Washing-

ton and Lee University law student, was stab-

bed and robbed of $40 at his 20 Fuller St.
apartment Monday around 9:30 p.m.

Based on Baker’s description, police arrested a 17-
year-old male on Morris Street around 10 p.m. The
juvenile was charged with robbery and malicious wound-
ing. He is being held in the Staunton Detention Home.

The robbery may be linked to a break-in at Baker’s
apartment during the Christmas holiday.

“They just messed up the door,” Baker said. “Be-
cause of the area I live in, my valuables were stored
away at a friend’s apartment. I thought it was an
isolated incident and because I was a student away for
break.”

At around 9:30 p.m. Monday night, while Baker was
studying in his apartment, a teenager came to his door
stating that he had information about the break-in. “He
asked me if there was a reward,” Baker said. “I said that
if he gave me any information that leads to this guy’s
arrest, I would give him 50 bucks.

“He said the guy’s name was William Smith and that
he was a white drug dealer from Roanoke. I didn’t give
him any money, and he left right after that. I thought it
was kind of odd, but I wasn’t that worried.”

About 10 minutes later, the same boy came to the
door again, this time with a friend. “They just walked
into the house uninvited and said they had the guy’s

“I felt something strike me on the back of my neck
and I thought he was hitting me. I turned and saw him
standing there with a knife. Then I realized that he had
stabbed me.”

The attacker stabbed Baker a few more times in the
face and arm, stopping only when the knife broke.
Pummeling Baker with his fists, the attacker demanded
that Baker hand over his money.

At some point, the teen stopped the attack and
allowed Baker to lead him to the bedroom where he
gave the boy the $40 out of his wallet.

“Then he said to me ‘Now I’m going to take you to
the police station for what you did.’ I told him that I’d
be happy to go to the police station,” Brian said.

After the attacker allowed Baker to put on his shoes
in the living room, Baker, noticing that the door was
wide open, escaped from the attacker. He ran about 100
yards to the police station.

Baker had three stitches in the back of his neck and
was treated for cuts on his face and arm at Stonewall
Jackson Hospital.

There was no other apparent motivation for the
attack other than the money, Baker says. “I had never
seen him before in my life and I hope I never see him
again.”

According to Baker, the person who accompanied
the attacker witnessed the events but did not participate.
Police have not made a second arrest.

PHI STAFF WRITER

The mad rush for Physical Education
registration earlier this month was an-
other reminder of Washington and Lee’s
somewhat archaic registration method.
W&L has made preliminary steps to

modernize the registration process to
either voice mail or Internet, but the high
cost of the project pushes the switch to at
least the fall term of 1998. The move
towards a computerized system raises
questions about changing tradition and a
possible loss of personal attention at
W&L.

The Committee on Registration and
Class Schedules was expanded last fall
to discuss new options; their analysis
leaned toward Internet registration rather
than voice mail. The cost to install voice

response technology, without consider-
ing thecost of personnel, is about $35,000,
University Registrar Scott Dittman said.
Dittman stated that the busy signal on the
phone may be as inconvenient as waiting
out in the cold.

“A web interface would be more ac-
cessible to students since most have ac-
cess to a computer or have one of their
own,” Dittman said.

However, W&Ldoesn’t employ any-
one with the ability to perform the pro-
grammingrequired,Dittman says. “There

Smith nominated for Pulitzer

BY TARAH GRANT
PHI NEws EDITOR

Rodney Smith, editor of “Shenandoah,” has been
nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for a distinguished vol-
ume of original verse for his work “Trespasser.”

“Trespasser” is a collection of 37 poems published
last summer. Ireland’s wild landscapes, pub music and
long conversations with its people inspired most of the
poems, said Smith. Louisiana State University, who
nominated the work for an award, describes Smith’s
poems as “knotty and precise, blazing into moments of
recognition with the elliptical testimony and spare light
of everyday of everyday objects.”

Smith received his bachelor’s degree in philosophy
from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

and a master’s degree in English from Appalachian
State University. He served as a writer-in-residence at
Auburn University for 19 years before becoming the
editor of “Shenandoah, The Washington and Lee Uni-
versity Review” in July 1995. In addition to “Tres-
passer,” Smith has written six other collections of
poetry and onecollection ofshortstories. His numerous
honors include the Emily Dickinson Prize and the John
Masefield Poetry Prize.

Smith considers “Trespasser” his most important
work. “‘Trespasser’ may manage to address themes of
great personal, even private, importance, while contain-
ing them in vessels that are less personal,” he said. “I
hope I’ve found a way to explore language, self and
something in the wider culture all at once, a task all

a difference between looking up infor-

The cost of a web interface ranges
anywhere between $35,000-$50,000,
depending on the amount of personnel.

point. lfwe get funding at the end ofthis
year, the earliest possible time for the

OPINION

JANUARY 20, 1997

Clinton should focus on race relations problem

During the Inauguration today, Will-
iam Jefferson Clinton will again officially
assume the duties and obligations of the
office of the Presidency. It is from this
point on, as Arthur Schlesinger Jr. states,
that Bill Clinton “faces his rendezvous
with history.” Unable to run for office

From the Left

again, Clinton must “make his mark be-
tween now and January 19, 2001.” With
his first term riddled with inconsistencies
and lack of strong leadership, Clinton now
has four years to turn the tide.
Schlesinger believes that “Clinton’s
second term offers at once the potential of
greatness and the potential of humilia-
tion.” In an article entitled, “The Ultimate
Approval Rating,” Schlesinger updates
his father’s earlier ranking of Presidents,.

As an introduction to the study of the
presidency, Professor Strong assigned this
reading and polled the members of my
Politics 335 class as to their opinions re-
garding who were indeed the best presi-
dents.

The findings of this informal poll only
mildly surprised me, give the political
climate of the W&L student community.
But at the same time, one particular re-
sponse galvanized my opinion that
Clinton’s ultimate goal should and must
be to solve the problem of race relations. It
is abundantly obvious that this is the most
important and consequential issue for the
future of America,

Forthe most part, the standard responses
for the best president poll were Ronald
Reagan, George Washington and Franklin
Roosevelt. However, it was one of the
answers for the worst president and Pro-
fessor Strong’s subsequent recount of a
similar occurrence that inflamed me to
devote an entire column to this subject.

While a large majority of students listed
Abraham Lincoln as one of the best presi-
dents, one anonymous student listed him
as the worst. Too much of a coward, in the

“What the
United States is
witnessing is a

ration in the
area of race
relations. ”

not-so-grand tradition of racists, to speak
up and attempt to intellectually defend his
position, I can only assume what he meant

when he put Abraham Lincoln in the same
category as Buchanan, Hoover and Nixon.

Is it as disturbing to you as to me that
someone actually believes that Lincoln is
the worst president because of his brave
and decisive action regarding the freedom
of slaves during the Civil War? Does
anyone actually believe that the United
States would be a better place had that
never occurred? Lamentably, I guess the
answer to the latter question is yes.

What the United States is witnessing is

a general deterioration in the area of race
relations. Examine the huge split between
whites and African-Americans regarding
the outcome of the OJ. Simpson trial.
Remember the riots that occurred in Los
Angeles not so long ago. Consider what
the implicationsof the end of Affirmative
Action.

It is obvious that this has become a clear
and present danger for the USnited States.
If attitudes like the student’s in my class
persist and multiply, what can we say

about our future? We are all at a critical
juncture; what we need is strong leader-
ship and President Clinton to set clear
goals in order to stem the growing discon-
tent felt by both sides of this issue.

In all honesty though, it is not at all
important to pursue a course of action
with the mere purpose to curry favor
with historians in order to secure a
favorable position in the history
books. Essentially, Bill Clinton just
needs to do the right thing.

Finally, I would just like to make
one statement: Just because this col-
umn is written under the title “From
the Left” does not mean that this is
exclusively a liberal viewpoint. Al-
though my naiveté might be overcom-
ing me again, I believe that both con-
servatives and liberals have similar
sentiments regarding the need for ac-
tion in this area. Where conserva-
tivcs and liberals divide is over how
such action should be taken.

Like “Muppets Tonight” okay,
“Melrose Place” maybe not. Per-
sonally, I think it’s a good idea.
Television includes more sex and
violence than ever before. Is it
really appropriate for an eleven
year-old to hear on “Friends” that
Ross fantasizes about Princess Leia

can’t imagine the effect it has on a

But the new rating system only
helps children. What about us
adults? Maybe we like sex and
violence but would like to be
warned about otherthings we might
find offensive? I propose a new,
expanded rating system.

My first change would have to
do with those trashy made-for-TV
movies which often feature Tori

shocking titles like, “Betrayed by

Alex:

I want a brawl.

The students stuffed into North-
ern Auditorium Wednesday night
were expecting fireworks, or at
least a few sparks to ﬂy between
Alex Chistensen and Glen Miller.
The war of words was getting its
voice.

Life on the Hill
C. E. Miller ’98

Christensen and Miller have
spent the past few months sparring
in The Trident. For those of you
who have failed to notice this, Miller
writes a satirical column that often
pokes fun at the gay, lesbian, and
bisexual organization commonly
known as G&L. Christensen is the
Chairperson of G&L and the only
student member out of the closet.

The debate was suppose to be
about the role of G&L on our cam-
pus. People were expecting accu-
sations, fist fights and perhaps a
riot between the leftist “commies”
thatare secretlyinfiltratingourcam-
pus, and the “good ’ole southern
boys” who still believe the confed-
eracy exists. I suppose that is the
only explication for the number of
people crammed into Northern Au-
ditorium.

The inherent conﬂict between
the two was summed up in the
opening statements: “I’m gay,”
Christensen said. “I’m not gay,”
Miller said, Amy Gorham, Execu-
tive committee Vice President
served as the impartial moderator.
Both Miller and Christensen agreed
to adhere to a reasonable standard
of gentlemanly behavior. The
crowd laughed. I suppose that is
because throughout the exchange
of letters, and Miller’s column there
has been no respect for each other
or the position each takes.

Christensen complained that
Miller had taken his jesting too far.
“I have no problem with humor,”
he said, “I have a problem with
rude, mean, perpetual stupidity.”
This summed up the core of Alex’s
debate: He claims that there are
other things to ridicule on a weekly
basis besides G&L.

Miller’s opening statement was
formal and longer than the allotted
eight minutes. He was prepared,
reading from his notes, citing love
of Washington and Lee and conser-
vative values as his basis of objec-

tion to G&L, “It is the ﬂagship for
all other liberal politically correct
movements,” he said, of G&L.

Twelve minutes into the debate
and no fist ﬁghts. The crowd was
crammed against the walls. Here
and there cameras ﬂashed and
rolled recording the Miller v.
Christensen debate for posterity.

Miller talked of integrating ho-
mosexual students and looking for
hidden designs within G&L’s
agenda. He asked Christensen to
explain why they focused on ac-
ceptance and not integration. He
felt that Christensen was a rather
unobtrusive leader for the organi-
zation, but that in a few years a
new leader could take a more radi-
cal approach and demand repre-
sentation in many student organi-
zations. When accused of wild
paranoia, he agreed.

“I have basis for my paranoia,”
he said, “There are many other
liberal arts colleges that are no
longer what they were because of
political correctness.”

“I am a conservative Republi-
can,” Christensen said, “I don’t
want to change W&L.” While
Miller seemed ready to debate the
topic at hand, the role of G&L at
W&L, Christensen seemed more
concerned about getting Miller to
stop publishing satire of G&L
week after week.

“The back page of The Trident
is funny,” Miller said. “That is
why I write it: People laugh. You
should learn to laugh.”

Miller declined to ask his last
question and both declined clos-
ing remarks. Gorham dismissed
the crowd at 8:25 p.m. The war of
words was just talk. People cleared
out a little disappointed, hanging
around the lobby to talk about
what they felt wasn’t discussed in
the debate. Casual observances
were made as to whether Miller
will stop ridiculing G&L. It

seemed to be a split crowd, many A

coming down hard on Christensen
saying he chose this school and he
should deal with the conse-
quences. Others took
Christensen’s point of view, want-
ing more tolerance on the cam-
pus.
There wasn’t even a brawl.

SOC ITT iO|2 Till <ﬁl2lS DISD ﬂTS STUDENT lﬁ fill

PHI FEATURES EDITOR

Visitors of the Alumni House
last Thursday discovered a
rather unusual art exhibition.

Instead of caviar and cham-
pagne, visitors were served pigs-
in-a—blanket and plastic cups
filled with applejuice. Some of
the artwork on display also
served as the evening’s furni-
ture. The student artists onhand
had dressed in their most ex-
travagant attire, in mimicry of
sophisticates who frequent less
light-hearted art openings.

The event was the Faux So-
phisticate, sponsored by the So-
ciety for the Arts, which show-
cased the talent of fourteen stu-
dent artists. Sarah Anne Ryder,
a self-described “jack-of-all-
trades” and member of the SFA,
characterized the evening as
“a half-serious show of
serious work.”

“It was half-serious, not
half-assed,” added Robert
McKinnon, the Chair of

the SFA.

The Society for the Arts is a
student organization which
fosters the appreciation of
artistic ability at Washington
and Lee University.

“We facilitate the apprecia-
tion of the talent present on
campus. We show that to the
community, faculty, and other
students. It is this talent which
provides richness and variety
to Washington and Lee,”
stated Ryder.

According to McKinnon, the
SFA achieves this goal by pro-
viding a venue for the exhibi-
tion of students’ artistic talents
as well as a forum for open
discussion of pertinent topics.

“People either don’t care, or
don’t understand, or don’t have
the time to see what everyone
else is doing,” McKinnon

stated. “There seem to be dot- _

ted lines around all the depart-
ments. A lot of the people on
campus don’t experience ev-
erything that they can in four
years. We like to encourage
experience.”

The SFA hosts various exhi-
bitions of different kinds
throughout the year, including
poetry readings, concerts, and
art shows such as the Faux
Sophisticate.

Both McKinnon and Ryder
are pleased with the success of
last Thursday evening.

“By and large it was the most
social event we’ve ever hosted:
not only was people’s attention
on the art, but also on one
another,” McKinnon stated.

“A couple of faculty came,”
McKinnon continued. “We’re
glad to see that we have support
from the community. It was
also good to see some local art-
ists there for us.”

The Society for the Arts will
host a musical performance by
The Big Cats on Wednesday,
January 22, at 8:00 p.m. in the
GHQ. Admission to the con-
cert is free.

Also, the SFA will meet on
Thursday, January 23, in duPont
109 at 7:00 p.m. Coffee will be
served. Everyone is welcome
to attend.

Awards are presented not only to

papers in large cities and national
magazines. In fact, the Norfolk Vir-
ginian-Pilot received the Angus
McDougall Editing Award, the
highest award in this competion,
given to a newspaper in recognition
of outstanding photography editing.

“Ghosts of Mississippi”:
A line, incomplete effort

~A'*~A'1/2 of

4 stars;

a bit
off-balance
The pitch:
“lt’lI be like
‘JFK’ in
Mississippi.”

BY ALEX CHRISTENSEN
PHI MovIE CRITIC

There’s a reason that Oliver Stone’s “JFK’ doesn’t
delve too deeply into the life and political career of
John F. Kennedy: the whole country is steeped in it.
President Kennedy’s death left a deep psychic wound
which resulted in a fascination with his life, death, and
descendants, probably unprecedented in American his-
tory. Only Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr. come
close. Maybe Elvis.

JFK’s story is more mysterious, though. It’s never
been close to solved. There’s one other reason: Stone
has wacky theories about what JFK was about to do in
Vietnam, which history does not endorse, so indulging
them too closely in the film would strain credibility
even farther than he already does. Still, he includes
speeches by Eisenhower and Kennedy and other foot-
age which paint just enough of the background to tell
his compelling if flawed story more than effectively.

Unfortunately, Rob Reiner, who is working in
“Ghosts of Mississippi” with the story of a generally
much lesser known public figure, Medgar Evers, doesn’t
realize how much of Evers’s story is needed to tell the
story he is telling, about the trial(s) and ultimate con-
viction of Evers’s assassin, Byron de la Beckwith.

How can an audience be expected to be left with the
full measure ofthe tragedy of his death and the triumph
of bringing Beckwith to justice without that knowl-
edge? I’m not suggesting that Reiner had to tell Evers’s
story (definitely worth telling in a movie with as big a
budget and cast) instead of the trials of Beckwith, just
that the story of Beckwith is incomplete without more
about Evers.

What Reiner does do is tell a story which is indeed
fascinating and important. Alec Baldwin, wrongly over-
looked as an actor recently, did great work this year in
Phil Joanou’s also overlooked “Heaven’s Prisoners,”
and he does it again in “Ghosts of Mississippi.” Baldwin
portrays Bobby DeLaughter,_the prosecuting attorney

. who finally lit a fir.e unde.r. th?§’Evers..da‘sé after thirty 

years (after Myrlie Evers, his widow, portrayed by
Whoopi Goldberg, lit a fire under him).

Baldwin, working with a familiar cliché, the white
lawyer-hero correcting injustice, manages to bring a
dignity and respect to the role largely missing in Kevin
Costner’s Jim Garrison, Matthew McConaughey’s Jake
Brigance, and Chris O’Donnell’s Adam Hall. This is
really quite a task. Gregory Peck did it. It is accom-
plished also through the use of the characters of
DeLaughter’s children, who function as a sort cf Greek
chorus, constantly questioning why DeLaughter is do-
ing this or that, how they should respond, and what
they should know about the history of the place in
which they live.

Indeed, while done well, this accomplishment dis-
turbingly unbalances the structure of the film. When
DeLaughter identifies with Medgar Evers, which he
certainly needs to do, it manipulates the audience into
transferring moral authority to DeLaughter, who doesn’t
really earn it the way Evers did, from the memory of
Evers himself. This could have been avoided not by
changing the development of Baldwin’s character, but
by giving us more of Evers, so that instead of this
psychic transference, DeLaughter’s actions and deci-
sions would become echoes and tributes rather
than substitutes.

As it is, the movie still works, but it’s too easy. John
Sayles’s Lone Star of last year comes closest to this
kind of storytelling, allowing the past and present to
coexist and comment on each other without either side
“winning.” In “Ghosts of Mississippi,” the present
wins for being more morally up-to-date, but it does a
disservice, if slight, to Evers’s memory.

Still, the production is first-class all the way, with
solid, creditable performances by Baldwin, Goldberg,
and the shockingly evil Byron de la Beckwith created
by James Woods. Medgar Evers’s son Darrell plays
himself and Martin Luther King, Jr.’s daughter Yolanda
plays Medgar Evers’s daughter Reena.

Charles Evers (Bill Cobbs in the film), Medgar
Evers’s brother, also gets a slight. In real life, Charles
Evers took over from Medgar Evers as NAACP field
secretary after his death (which is briefly mentioned),
but also continued the political fight by becoming the
first black mayor ofa bi—racial Mississippi town in 100
years when he became mayor of Fayette and ran for
governor and senator from Mississippi unsuccessfully.
In the film, he is portrayed as a radio station owner
who, by implication, has probably been withdrawn and
contemplative since his brother was killed. In reality,
he stirred things up his whole life, becoming friends
with George Wallace, David Duke, and Ronald Reagan,
and bucking the black establishment by becoming a
Republican. Charles Evers is not the retiring, sit-back
figure portrayed in the film.

Winter rush
a success

BY ERICA PROSSER
PHI STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s first-ever
men’s Winter Rush has drawn to a
close, and the time has come to deter-
mine the success of this year of changes.

According to Associate Dean of
Students Leroy “Buddy” Atkins aver-
age freshmen male GPA this fall term
was 2.799, a number that Dean of
Students Dennis Manning says is per-
haps as much as one-tenth of a point
higher than previous years. Dean
Atkins also reports that the average
GPA of the fraternities this fall term
was 3.026, a rise from previous fall
terms. Dean Manning attributes this
fall’s rise in GPA to the later rush.

These promising numbers lead

ManningtoaffirmthatthewinterRush
schedule will be pursued in future
years.
Manningbelievesthatsororitieshad
an excellent rush as well, and adds that
Kappa Delta, the new sorority, is “off
to a good start.”
, “This rush was an extraordinary
success, and I attribute that success to
the excellent leadership of Anthony
Mazzarelli, Sara Benson, and Dean
Atkins,” Manning continued. “The
University is very fortunate to have
these people.” Mazzarelli is the presi-
dent of the Interfraternity Council, and
Benson is the president of Panhellenic.

posing this change,” Dittman said.
“We have always asked students to
pick a course, not a particular time or
session, but with Internet registration,
they would be able to do so. Some
professors are not too happy about
that.”

Many students feel that W&L’s
present method of registration lacks a
uniform policy and that students that
abide by the rules are often at a disad-
vantage. “I got closed out of a class
because Iwaited to the day when my
class was supposed to register,” Sopho-
more Jennifer Mandeville said.

Some feel that the cost of upgrad-
ing to a modern method has more than
a financial price. With Internet regis-
tration, W&L’s tradition of personal
attention to each student might be
minimized. While students now can
plead with a professor for entrance
intoa class, the cries for help would
not be heard from a computer. “I like
dealingone-on—onewith people,”Jun-
ior Justin Riedell said. “I think they
should just hand out the registration
sheets before it starts so we don’t have
to wait out in the freezing cold outside
the registrar’s office.”

The registrar’s office has consid-
ered handing out the sheets in ad-
vance, but this increases the change of
students losing them, Dittman said.

W&L hired a computer consultant
to assess options, and will deliver a
report to President Elrod later this

month. After that, the administration
will have a better idea what direction
W&L will go in the 21st century.

DEBATE, from pg. 1

send W&L down a slippery slope by
introducing political correctness and
other evils that could eventually “trans-
form W&L into an ordinary liberal arts
school of little appeal and less repute.”

Christensen suggested that Miller’s
concerns consist of “pure paranoia” but
Miller cited “just about every other
college” as evidence for his slippery
slope argument.

“W&L isn’t going to fall for some
grand political correctness,” responded
Christensen. “We’re not interested in
that politically. I’m a conservative
Republican. We’re not pushing any-
thing but tolerance.”

Miller also confronted Christensen
about G&L’s“ostentatious”comingout
day.

“Coming out events are designed
speciﬁcally to glorify sexual orienta-
tion, nothing else,” Miller said. “If the
gay and lesbian students on this campus
feel the need to celebrate their brand of
sexuality, in my opinion they should go
ahead and do it.

“But they should retreat to their bed-
rooms-or their G&L safehouse-and do
what they need to do there.”

The debate ended abruptly, after less
than 30 minutes, when neither side had
additional questions or closing state-
ments. '

“I think Glenn came prepared and
Alex chickened out on him,” said Matt
Seals about the debate. “I think Alex
gave up-forfeited!-because he couldn’t
hold his ground on factual issues.”

POLL, from pg. 1

women viewed homosexuality as
wrong while a majority of men said
that homosexuality is wrong.

“I am very supportive of the G&L
association and homosexual rela-
tions,” said student Maria Hardin.
She also believes that “women on
this campus are generally more lib-
eral than the men.”

G&L, a controversial organization
for homosexuals and bisexuals, has
been under fire from all sides overthe
last year.

Christensen, the openly gay presi-
dent of the group, said the poll results
were “good news” for his organization.

“More and more students respect
what others want to do and decide to

keep their noses out of other people’s
business,” said Christensen, who calls
himself a conservative Republican.
“Other polls have shown that young
people are very conservative but much
more tolerant than usual.”

Freshman Grant Langston agreed
that G&L has a right to exist. “They
certainly have the right to be here,”
Langston said, “but you can’t change
people’s minds and make them accept-
able on campus.”

There are about 10 active members
in G&L, and Christensen estimates that
there are 50 to 75 homosexuals on eam—
pus. He even knows gay faculty and
staff, some of whom have gay family
members.

egregious cases.

“There are two sides to every story,” Saboe said, “we wanted to give
the person who filed the compliant a voice.” This voice allows the
victim the right to report the misconduct, appear as a witness, receive
notice of the decision and to appeal that decision.

Sandy Hooper, Executive Committee President, suggested that the
role ofthe SJC Chair in investigating reports of misconduct be limited.
Previously, the Chair investigated all reports; in the revised version
the SJC Chair will appoint another Justice to investigate.

The appeal process was shortened from seven to three days, and
final decision in an appeal case was turned over to the University
Board of Appeals. The decision previously rested with the SJC.

In order to propose amendments to the Blue Book, students now
must gain 75 signatures on a petition and submit it to a public hearing.
It then must be approved by the faculty.

This year the revamped SCC has implemented weekly meetings and
hearings which they feel has contributed to the increase in reports of
misconduct.

The current SCC, by the end of January, will have handled more
cases than were handled by the previous SCC in an entire year.

Dean Howison would rather not comment on the effectiveness and
fairness of the SCC in years’ past. SCC President Robert Covington
and Secretary Saboe have spearheaded the efforts to destroy to SCC
and replace it with the SJC. If the revisions pass in March, they will
have succeeded.

times did not continue in a busy
four-game week as the Generals
dropped all four to fall to 5-8
overall, 3-5 in the ODAC.

The week started in tough
fashion for the women as they
lost a heartbreaking 62-60 game
against Roanoke in the Warner
Center.

W&L and Roanoke were tied
at 60 when the Maroons’ Ashley
McCallum grabbed a
loose ball and sank a
game-winning
jumper with only 1.8
seconds left to break
the Generals’ hearts.

After leading 27-
26 at halftime, W&L
controlled the pace of
the second half. The
Generals matched
their biggest lead at
50-43 on an Amber

But the ceiling caved in for
the Generals after that as
Roanoke tied the score at 60 on
a layup with 44 seconds left.
Playing for the last shot, W&L
turned the ball over with 18 sec-
onds left, setting the stage for
McCallum’s game-winner.

Sophomore Amber Hinkle
led the way with 14 points for
the Generals. Freshmen Ansley
Miller and Jessica Morton each
added 13 points.

W&L embarked on a long
road trip Tuesday night as the
team travelled to Harrisonburg
to face Eastern Mennonite. EMU
was not a gracious host as it
dispatched the Generals, 81-75.

Eastern Mennonite led by

Generals caught fire as they ral-
lied back to forge a 67-66 edge
with 4:27 remaining on a Tonia
Dean bucket. EMU, however,
reeled off a 13-2 run in the next
four minutes to take command.

Morton had a huge game by
scoring a career-high 24 points,
including 9-10 at the free-throw
line. Sophomore Chrissy
Burghardt pitched in 14 points,
and Dean grabbed a career-high
16 rebounds.

PHI SPORTS EDITOR

The men’s basketball team is still looking
for its first win of 1997 after dropping three
games in the past week.

The Generals hung
tough in games against
Roanoke last Saturday,
Lynchburg Wednesday
and Randolph-Macon
Saturday, but dropped all
three, leaving their record
at 2-1] overall, 1-6 in the
ODAC.

The men began the
week with a home con-
test against bitter
archrival Roanoke, but
the fifth-ranked Maroons pulled away late to
win, 91-77.

The Generals trailed only 62-57 with 11:55
remaining in the second half, but Roanoke
proved too tough down the stretch, going on a
14-2 run over the next five minutes to pull
away.

The game proved even more disastrous for
the Generals when star senior guard Chris
Couzen was forced to retire after the game due
to a nagging shoulder injury. The W&L co-
captain wastheonly seniorontheteam and will
finish an excellent career in third place on the
W&L all-time steals list.

Freshman center Rich Peterson had a mon-
ster game, scoring a career-high 28 points and

 

pulling down 11 rebounds. Freshman forward
Scott Hudson also had a career-high with his 15
points.

Washington and Lee remained at home
Wednesday night to entertain Lynchburg, but
the Generals succumbed, 83-77. W&L started
the game on fire, shooting an impressive 61
percent from the field in the first half to lead 46-
45 at halftime. The Generals extended the lead
to 51-45 early in the second stanza.

After Lynchburg rallied to take the lead, the
Generals regained the advantage at 71-70 on a
Matt Jackson jumper with 4:48 left. But
Lynchburg’s Otis Tucker grabbed the limelight
by pouring in the next nine points to give the
Generals a deficit from which they could not
recover. Tucker lit up the Warner Center with
31 points on the night.

Peterson notched his second straight double-
double to once again lead the Generals with his
21 points and 10 rebounds. Jackson also had a
strongnightwith 17points and seven rebounds.

The Generals started out the RandOlph-Ma-
con game Saturday in similar fashion to the
Lynchburg game as W&L led by eight points in
the first half and 35-31 at halftime.

But the Yellow Jackets turned the tables in
the second half by racking up 56 points on a
scorching 65 percent shooting clip to run away
from the Generals.

Kelly Dyer scored 20 points and Jackson 13
for W&L. Peterson added 12 points, 11 coming
in the second half.

The Generals continue the quest for their
first victory of the new year Wednesday night
at Emory & Henry.

Adam Branson and T.J. Griffin
also tallied a pair of victories
against Davidson. Branson took
a 16-4 major decision at 134
pounds while Griffin had a huge
11-9 victory at 167.

The Generals dropped their
second meet in the tournament
to Pensacola Christian, 48-3.
McManimen was the only Gen-
eral to post a win with an im-
pressive 11-9 overtime victory.

W&L alumnus, professor defend
ABC in investigative tactics ease  

BY AARON FOLDENAUER
PHI STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee Professor
of Religion Louis Hodges and Alum-
nus William Jeffress (’67) played
key roles in the lawsuit between
Food Lion and ABC that attracted
nationwide attention. Hodges served
as an expert witness for ABC and
Jeffress was the lead ABC attorney.

The lawsuit concerned ABC’s un-
dercover reporting tactics in a 1992
“PrimeTime
Live” hidden-
camera exposé
that accused
Food Lion of
repackaging
and selling old
meat and
chicken.

Despite the
efforts of
W & L ’ s
Hodges and
Jeffress, last
week Food
Lion was
awarded over
$5.5 million in
punitive dam-
ages.

“This is a
major case. This is not lightweight
stuff,” said Hodges who testified

“A very long

journalistic
method of
investigation is
at stake here.”

for ABC on the history of under-

cover reporting in the United States.

“I’m afraid it might do some very
serious damage, as a matter of fact.”

Since September, Hodges
worked with an ABC legal team
reading depositions and research-
ing scholarly and industry standards
in the field of investigative jour-
nalism.  '

Hodges is the Director and
Founder of W&L’s ethics program
and routinely conducts journalism
seminars in newsrooms across the
country.

The leader of the ABC team was
Jeffress, former student body presi-
dent of W&L and graduate of Yale
Law School. He has been a trial law-
yer since 1972, and his Washington
D.C. law firm specializes in complex
litigation.

The ABC team picked Hodges to
play a key role in the defense team
after discovering a 1988 article of
Hodges that reflected the position of
ABC.

In the article, which appeared in the
“Journal of Mass Media Ethics,”
Hodges lays out three conditions
that must be met in order to justify
undercover reporting: the issue
must be of significant importance
to the general public; there must
not be a more reasonable, honest
way of efficiently getting the nec-
essary information; and the under-
cover reporter must not masquer-
ade in a role he cannot perform and
must not threaten the safety of inno-

Music department presents
‘Schubertiade’ program

BY COURTNEY MILLER
PHI STAFF WRITER

Social fraternities, similar to the
Greeks on Washington and Lee
University's campus, were outlawed by
the King of Hungary in the late 1700’s.
The artists and musicians of that time
did what any Greek boy would dotoday:
they continued the party in someone
else’s living room.

The Washington and Lee music de-

partment will be recreating this spirit

Tuesday, Jan. 28 at 8 p.m. in the Johnson
Theater. “Scnubertiade” will celebrate
the life and works of Franz Schubert.

“It will be short selections of music
interspersed by anecdotes and history,”
Scott Williamson, professor of music,
said.

In Schubert’s time the political and
social climate forced social gatherings
underground. Schubert invited play-
wrights, poets, opera singers and musi-
cians to perform in an informal setting.
He often premiered his latest works for
these audiences, said Williamson. After

dinner the guests would dance and dis-
cuss politics.

Kirk Follio, a German professor, will
be readingshort selectionsofSchubert’s
poetry in German. Soprano Catherine
Gaylard and Williamson, a tenor, will
perform several of Schubert’s songs.

“This is a great chance to learn about
Schubert outside of a classroom set-
ting,” Emily Framptom, music history
major, said.

Framptom will be talking about
Schubert’spiano compositionsTuesday.
The other music history majors will
present short talks on several aspects of
Schubert. »

‘‘It was Williamson’s idea to involve
the majors in the Schubertiade,”
Framptom said. “It’ll be interesting to
see how everything works out.”

Afterthe event, the International Club
will host an Austrian-style reception
which the public is invited to attend.

‘‘I hope this will become part of the
interdisciplinary program,” Williamson
said. “It’ll be a great experience for all
those who attend.”

cent people.

“If all three conditions are met,”
Hodges said, “then it is morally good
for ajournalist to use deceptive means
to gather information.”

Hodges was on the stand for about
three hours in all on two different days,

' Jan. 8th and 10th.

7 “I felt sort of isolated, but it was not
at all trau-
matic,” said
Hodges. “I
knew the sub-
ject. And on
the stand,
you’ve got to
be pretty pre-
cise in what
you say.”

L i k e
J e f f r e s s ,
Hodges is not
without trial
experience.
Hodges re-
cently testified
against a Den-
ver newspaper
that wasbeingsued forlibel afterprint—
ing an inaccurate story that supposedly
damaged a local doctor’s reputation.

As for the conclusion of the Food
Lioncasethat has been active since 1992,
Jeffress speculated that appeals courts
will likely either overturn or reduce the
damages awarded to Food Lion. In the
meantime, the W&L alumnus is busy
“catching up on everything else.”

 

“The punitive
damage award

Verdict harms

investigative 

journalism

BY AARON FOLDENAUER
PHI STAFF WRITER

The recent judgment agai nst ABC’s
use of hidden cameras endangers the
future ofinvestigative reporting in the
United States, said Louis Hodges,
Washington and.Lee.Prof.essor of Re-
ligion and ABC expert witness.

The case is unusual because Food
Lion sued over the network’s decep-
tive techniques, not over the veracity
of ABC’s award-winning report.

The judge ruled Food Lion could
not recover lost profits since the report
was not proven false, but will receive
$5.5 million in punitive damages.

“The punitive damage award pun-
ishes journalists, when the truti= of what
was reported hasn’t been questioned,”
ABC attorney William Jeffress(’67) said.

Hodges agrees. “A very long-stand-
ing,tried-and-truejournalistic method
of investigation is at stake here,” he
said. “Many of the most important
stories in the history of American jour-
nalism have been done undercover.”

For example, Nellie Bly, in 1888,
posed as an patient in an insane asylum
that was mistreating patients. She
uncovered corruption and, as a result
of her work, the asylum was reformed.
She was one of a group ofjournalists
who effected much-needed social re-
form by revealing scandals. President
Theodore Roosevelt called journalists
like Bly “muckrakers.”

For decades, journalists have fol-
lowed Bly’s tactics and provided a
community service. According to
Hodges, the verdict of the Food Lion
and ABC case deﬁnitely harms the
field of investigative reporting.

OPINION

JANUARY 27, 1997

Clinton heads for distinguished place in history

When President Clinton took the oath of
office last Monday, he became the first Demo-
cratic president since Franklin Roosevelt to be
elected twice to the presidency. Clinton’s
second term does not face the dire circum-
stances that Roosevelt faced, communism is
dead, and the economy is running well, so

From the Right
Jason Zacher ’98

The Ring-tum Phi Editorial Editor

what is Clinton to do this term?

The things on Clinton’s agenda, to date,
have been very vague, but he will probably
outline some of them during his State of the
Union address. What we should probably ask
is what is on Hillary’s agenda, since without
her, Clinton would be a hapless president,
without any direction whatsoever. David Brock
said that Clinton has placed whatever prin-
ciples he has in a receivership maintained by

his wife. Even his most ardent defender,
James Carville, has asked other advisors where
Clinton stands on issues.

In a CNN/Time poll taken after the Novem-
ber election, of the 49 percent of voters that
cast their ballots for Clinton, only 14 percent
agreewithhispositions. Unfortunately,Clinton
sees his election as a mandate to enact his
policies, not much unlike the Republicans in
1994. Clinton will get more than his chance by
being the first president to have line-item veto
powers. Which way will his policies go?

Since he was governor of Arkansas,
Clinton’s policies have seemed to steadily
move right. However, this shift, which has
become readily apparent in his first term as
President, does not convince the Republicans,
and has alienated many Democrats also. Some
of Clinton’s promises in this recent campaign
came at the behest of Democratic party leader-
ship. Two other Presidents this century have
alienated their parties, and both had disastrous
second terms: Woodrow Wilson and Richard
Nixon.

When Wilson was reelected in 1916, he
also only received 49 percent ofthe vote. His
gradual adoption of the progressivism cham-

“Clinton is set-
ting himself up
to set his place
in history. That
place may not
be the glory he
envisions. . 

pioned by Repubiican Theodore Roosevelt
alienated him from his party leadership, and
when he ran into trouble over the Versailles

Treaty and the League of Nations, both parties
abandoned him.

Nixon was elected by voters that were grow-
ing tired of Democratic bunglings in Vietnam.
When Nixon’s domestic policies started to
drift left, he fell victim to the same thing that
claimed Wilson. When Watergate fell upon
him, he had alienated both the Democrats and
Republicans, and no one came to his aid.

In response to this, take the case of Ronald
Reagan. His Republican "Reagan Revolu-
tion" led him and the Republicans to two
landslide elections. Though he was disliked
by the Democrats, his consistently conserva-
tive policies had his party solidly behind him.
When the Iran-Contra story broke, arguably a
worse scandal than Watergate, others stood up
to take the heat for him. Reagan left office in
1989 a popular president.

This is not to say that Clinton’s second
term is goingto be plagued by a major scandal,

but after seeing his first term, I do not think it
would surprise anybody. So what does he
have on tap for his second term? We shall see

during the State of the Union. He will prob-
ably move a little fuilher right, and live all
alone between the parties."

Clinton tries to assert that he is not ideo-
logical, which Historian Gary Wills says,
“infuriates|iberals while not convincing con,-
servatives.” Clinton is setting himself up to
set his place in history. That place may not be
the glory he envisions, but rather, the same
place Wilson and Nixon hold. We remember
them mostly for their failures.

Clinton needs to understand that poli-
cies will be passed, and people will get
hurt. By trying to be everything to every-
body, he becomes nothing to everybody.
There is no initiative that everyone will
like. And maybe,just maybe, for once in
his political career he should not consult
fifteen polls to decide his position on
something.

Then everybody, from Carville to Newt
Gingrich will know what he stands for,
and they can make a reasonable judgement
about him.

It is time the students realize
that if the faculty approves the

it will make a difference in how
each one of us behaves. Big

stories about Paul Saboe and Rob-
ertCovington’scrusadeto destroy
the Student Conduct Committee
and introduce the SJC, a revital-
ized organization modeled closely
after the Executive Committee.
Then I got my own copy of the
Blue Book and I read it.

The Blue Book basically out-
lines the structure of the SJC and
the power that it has—power that
is controlled by the Student Af-
fairs Committee who in turn re-
ports to the faculty. That is why
the students need to know enough
about the SJC to give the faculty
feedback. In March they could
pass this proposal and change the
way misconduct cases are handled.

Before this crusade started, the
SCC was a little known group that
dealt with reports of conduct vio-
lation, with members appointed
by the Executive Committee. This
year’s members have heard more
misconduct cases already than
were heard last year. Many people
have been put on Social Probation
for the remainder of the year.

What is Social Probation? As
defined by the Blue Book it keeps
a student from participating in any
university or fraternity sponsored
social function held on campus.
Read: no Fancy Dress, no base-
ment band parties, no Fridays!

It is such a severe punishment,
and one which is terribly hard to
enforce. So as a student if I were
on Social Probation and I showed

I would be in violation of a SJC
sanction which would result in

I know that immediate suspen-
sion doesn’t sound too threaten-
ing, but imagine if it were the
middle of Winter Term: I would
have to go home and vacate my
place of residence. Tuition money
for the term and all the work ac-
complished would be void. Then I
could come back Spring Term. If
the lightest suspension was ap-
plied. If not it could be a long
time before I could enroll again.

Have I got your attention yet? I
should because Social Probation
was given to a student very re-
cently for “acting improperly in a
volatile situation.” In other words
the guy got into a fight.

A student forum was held in
October to talk about the SJC and

suspension

“the -Blue- Book.-' Fewer than ten

students attended. For you math
geniuses out there that is less than
one percent of our students.

There are a lot of issues in the
Blue Book that we need to under-
stand. Go to the Web sight on the
W&L homepage under studentac-
tivities, look it up, read it, get to
know it, so when people ask you
your opinion on keeping the pro-
ceeding confidential, much like
the EC you can tell them what you
think. There is even a convenient
way to send your comments di-
rectly to the SCC.

lfthis does pass in March we as
a student body will have to elect
justices to the Council, as well as
a secretary and a chair. We need
to know as muchas we can before
that election, so we elect people
who will approach the power given
to the SJC with the proper respect
and understanding.

Dean of Students, David L.
Howison has promised than an-
other forum will be held before
the March faculty vote. He also
said the forum will be well publi-
cized. We need to show up at this
forum, we as a student body need
to know what is going on. This is
not a small issue that won’t affect
many people. This is huge.

In an interview for The Tri-
dent, SCC Senior Representative,
Sasha Hartman intimated that the
SJC could become as influential
as the EC. I agree and I think that
before we give them that power
we as a student body need to let
the faculty know what we think
about it.

time all depended on whether
we won Homecoming, which
we never did,” remembers Mer-
chant. “If you got in trouble,
then you had to wear a yellow
beanie. Kind of reminds you of
Hitler.”

“There were boxes set up all
over campus where students
could put complaints. If you
didn’t wear your coat and tie to
go uptown on Sunday to get a
paper, you might get a com-
plaint filed against you,” said
John. “It was a lot like ‘Big
Brother is Watching You.”’

By the late ’60’s, the mood
of the nation, and the campus,
had changed. “When I left in
’6l, everyone was in coat and
tie. When I came back in ’70,
you were lucky ifthe guys wore
trousers to class,” said Mer-

‘ chant. “I think everyone was

trying to conform to not-con-
forming.”

“Ithinkthestudent body still
believed in the W&L’s tradi-
tions. They just didn’t want to
be forced into them” said John.

“At the time, I think they
thought it was necessary to
bond the freshmen to the
community,” said Merchant.
“But I think we’ve moved be-
yond that now.”

Say, that beanie looks swell:

Up until the late- 1960’s, all W&L freshmen were
required to wear either blue or yellow beanies.
As depicted here, the unofficial (but enforced)
dress code included a tie, slacks, and coat.

According to a recent article in
Newsweek, twenty years ago two
close friends made a bet over who

' was going to undertake a movie
project. Steven Spielberg “won” and
drew the high nurpber. The “Ioser,”

George Lucas, drew the low.number ..

and made “Star Wars.” ‘\  .

The movie that no one wanted to
make grossed $134 million in the
United States alone by the end ofthe
summer of 1977. The grand total for
at the trilogy worldwide was $1.3
billion.

1

“Star Wars” was more than just a
money-making success. True, it did
gross more money than ever dreamed
possible at the time. Its success with
young people and the toy industry
changed the face ofthe movie indus-
try forever. But, above all, it was
one of the things that defined our
childhood.

“I think it struck a creative bone

in all of us as kids,” sophomore Doug

Peddle said. “One of my most vivid
childhood memories was playing
with my brother for hours mixing
and matching our GI Joe and Go Bot
vehicles with our Star Wars figures.”

Some of our generation looked up
to the characters.

“I wanted to be Princess Lea,”
said junior Melody Andreola. ‘‘I
used to braid my hair like hers all the
time.”

Everyone will get the chance to
relive their childhood when “Star
Wars” is re-released to the theaters
Friday, January 31, nearly twenty
years afterits first release. Lucasfilm
spent $15 million restoring the mas-
ter prints and adding 4.5 minutes of
additional computer generated foot-
age.

‘The official “Star Wars Special
Edition” web site outlines some in-
teresting changes in the movie:

— Obi Wan’s house has been re-
modeled.

— There are more ambient sound
effects throughout the film, adding
to its realism.

The web site alsolists somethings
that could have been changed but
were not: .

— Luke still yells “Carrie!” after
returning to Yavin.

— Lucasfilm forgot to color in

Va,der’s saber after he kills Obi‘-‘Wan. ;

(.jT§jIey failed-to do this in the original
as well.)

“The Empire Strikes Back” returns
to the big screen February 21. “The
Return ofthe Jedi” follows on March 7.

WLUR plans a semester featuring more music

BY DAVID BALSLEY
PHI FEATURES EDITOR

Students who tune into WLUR
this semester will discover that a
few changes have been made at
their campus radio station. In or-
der to improve listeners’ enjoyment
of the station, student dj’s have
been encouraged to talk less and to
play more music.

Charles Carabello, Editor of
WLUR, feels that some former stu-
dent dj’s have talked too much on
the air, especially about them-
selves.

In order to remedy the situation,
Carabello has asked the directors

of the station’s different musical
genres to encourage their own dj’s
to reserve airtime for more perti-
nent information.

“It is my hope that each of the
directors would talk it over with
their own dj’s,” Carabello com-
mented. “We would like people to
tell the time, the weather, and the
last couple of songs.”

In addition, the station’s morning
shows now feature more local, na-
tional, and sports news.

Carabello empathizes with stu-
dent dj’s who want to talk on the
air.

“I understand that they may be
thinking, ‘Wow, cool, I’m on the
air,”’ Carabello stated. Carabello

adds that he also understands that
student dj’s may want to entertain
their friends by being humorous
and verbose on the air.

However, Carabello would like
the dj’s to conduct themselves in a
manner which contributes to the
listeners’ enjoyment of the shows.

Carabello concedes that the deci-
sion of how much to talk on the air
remains in the hands of the dj’s.
Carabello would be unwilling to fire
students who fail to comply with the
suggestions of their managers.

“You can’t do that, unless you’re
paying people, which we’re not,”
Carabello commented. “I can’t ask
volunteers to conform to how I want
the station to run,”

Crutches offer urliquei/iew of ball

BY ANDREA EWING
PH1 FEATURES EDITOR

I hate crutches.

I had the wonderful op-
portunity to attend Washing-
ton and Lee Law School’s
Barrister’s Ball Friday night.

The catch - I hobbled in
on crutches.

Most people eat dinner

«with their dates before a

function, so my friend Becca
and I cooked dinner for ours
early in the evening. Every-
thing was just fine.

Tip: If possible, avoid any
activity you would not gen-
erally particiapte in before
attending a formal function.

I, of course, did not fol-
low my own advice. I went
to perform with the Rebelles
at halftime of the basketball

game, where I gracefully dis-
located my left knee in a
freak accident. ( I swear
someone greased the floor!)

I left my date, Josh, at
7:30 walking like any nor-
mal human, and the next time
he saw me my accessories
included not only matching

. earrings and necklace but a

new pair of very fashionable
Calvin Klein crutches
(bought especially to go with
the dress).

We drove to Moody Hall
for two reasons: 1) it was
already the plan and 2) there
was no way in hell I was
going to walk. I managed to
conquerthe steps and arrived
in the main lobby. (Inciden-
tally, wet stone stairs and
crutches do not mix.)

Matt, Becca’s date, took
my coat to the coat room and

returned with a wheel chair. 1
He and Kendra, another
member of our party, tried to

be helpful.
“We’ll wheel you
around,” they said. I had

tried to be as unobtrusive as
possible when I came in, and
now a wheel chair was pre-
sented to me.

Politely refusing, I said I
wanted to be able to get
around on my own. I had a
feeling members of my en-
tourage might be drinking,
and being wheeled by people
who had one too many screw-
drivers did not seem in my
best interest.

The band, Liquid Plea-
sure, was great and everyone
seemed to be having a really
good time.

I even made a major dis-
covery— standing in one

A " "».'2.I_'...ZI.4..._.§.T .‘..L.I'.'.I . . t.. .1"

place with all my weight on
my right leg and swaying in
time to the music looks a
little like dancing. Actually,
it looks a lot like W&L stu-
dents dancing. I am sure
Josh appreciated the effort.

Two open bars allowed for
those accompanying me to par-
take. lwas mighty tempted, but
then I thought, not only am I
wearing heels but I am also on
crutches. Alcohol would just
be stupid. While considering
this, I sipped a rum and coke.

I became well known as I
hobbled from location to loca-
tion.

“There goes Crutchy,” I
overheard one party goer say. I
also received many compli-
ments on my determination to
have a good time.

Another tip: You get loads
ofsympathy ifyou are injured.

3...".-L.'...'."'... {;.T._'3.‘ ;I...'. .Z’.. ;.'.."'_,..'. . .. . .'

Milk it for all it’s worth.

The time arrived for us to
leave, but before we could
do so a rather inebriated
young lady asked if her boy-
friend could borrow my
wheelchair. I assume she
had seen it offered to me
when I arrived. Naturally, I
told her he could have a
grand ole time with it.

The evening was not only
interesting, but also offered
many challenges. I became
adept at dancing on one leg,
maneuvering on wet stairs, and
being generally sociable while
looking like a gimp.

I can only offer one conclu-
sion after this experience:
Crutches suck, but if you must
have them, use them to your
advantage (i.e. look pitiful and
people will wait on you hand
and foot).

“The Relic”: good, old-
fashioned monster-y ‘un

The pitch:
“lt’lI be like
‘Jurassic
Park’ in
‘The Fly.”’

BY ALEX CHRISTENSEN
PHI MovIE CRITIC

Peter Hyams isn’t a very good director. He’ll probably
always be known for turning “20l0: The Year We Make
Contact,” the sequel to the admittedly overblown, yet wildly
provocative science fiction landmark “200l: A Space
Odyssey” from Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, into
what looked like a poor made-for-television melodrama.
Then he did a stint as the foremost interpreter of that
hauntingly mysterious Belgian, Jean-Claude Van Damme.
Hey, Capra had his Jimmy Stewart, Fellini had his
Mastroianni, Hyams had his Van Damme.

Well, Van Damme’s moved on to the Hong Kong action
émigrés, and Hyams has apparently moved on to big-budget
monster movies, with not altogether uninspiring results.

I can’t go so far as to say that “The Relic” is the new
“Jaws” or anything like that, but if you’re in the mood for a
monster movie, it should certainly fit that bill rather satisfy-
ingly. The story, which doesn’t matter much, is that this
Indiana Jones-type researcher in South America stumbles
upon a tribe which worships a sort ofa demon god. He sends
back an idol, or “relic,” along with some funny leaves

which have less than salutary effects when they come
in contact with living creatures, more of which later.

For some reason, he decides that he shouldn’t really
send them then, so since he can’t get them off the boat,
which is already leaving, he instead stows away on
board for the ride back to Chicago.

Meanwhile, back in Chicago, shapely science girl
Margo Green (Penelope Ann Miller) gets the shipment,
which, oddly, was finally delivered by a boat ALL OF THE
OCCUPANTS OF WHICH HAD BEEN DECAPITATED
AND DEPRIVED OF THEIR HYPOTHALAMUSES!
Okay, okay, some of y’all out there don’t like spoilers, but
that’s really not a spoiler. The point ofthe movie is to see the
gore and the big monster, known as the Kothoga. So it
probably won’t matter also ifl tell you that the monster is the

~ scientist morphed into a monster by the funny leaves. I

figured it out the minute he got on the boat, and that happens
during the opening credits.

Digital monsters have a shady track record, but this one
performs rather well, largely because Hyams doesn’t show
it too early or too much, and photographs it mostly in
darkness. This is the only competent directorial decision he
has made.

The dialogue in this movie isjust awful. And to hearthem
coming out of the mouths of usually competent actors like
Miller, Tom Sizemore, Linda Hunt and James Whitmore is
alternately hilarious and depressing. The plot is thin and
implausible, and when “Dr.” Margo Green finally figures
out that the researcher guy who sent the stuff home is the
monster and is surprised, you’ll want to slap her upside the
screen.

Nevertheless, I have to say that the monster is worth it. If
you like to see people getting eaten, their heads ripped off
and hypothalamuses sucked, this movie is a must. Sure, it’s
cheesy, stupid, poorly plotted and thought out, and even
annoying to watch with all of the flashlights Hyams insists
on pointing directly at the camera blinding you constantly,
but in the end, it’s a good chuckle and a half.

These ﬂashlights will be enough
to protect us:

“The Relic” offers good slasher fun for
horror fans and Kothoga alike.

WASHINGTON & LEE UNIVERSITY

Celebration heightens awareness

Black administrator, faculty
member voice concerns

BY AARON FOLDENAUER
PHI STAFF WRITER

Two black Washington and Lee University staff mem-
bers believe that not enough is being done to promote
racial diversity on campus.

Associate Dean of Students Anece McCloud thinks
upper administrators are not putting enough effort into
recruiting minority students. Professor of History
Theodore DeLaney is disturbed by the lack of black
professors and the lack of effort to recruit them.

"Ihe coeducation of Washington and
Lee was very successful, as it should have
been,” said DeLaney, “but I don't believe
that the integration of Washington and Lee
has been an equal success.”

According to DeLaney, W&L’s effort
to integrate the campus has been weak
compared to the effort to admit women.
Black faculty can serve as role models for
all students and evidence reveals that more
black students would be attracted to W&L
if there were more black faculty
members, he said.

Approximately 35 black stu-
dents attend W&L. There are
four black students in this year’s
freshman class.

“I think that administrators
who are involved in determin-
ing the student population on
campus believe they are com-
mitted to admitting more Afri-
can-Americans,” McCloud said.
“Now there is a saying that ac-
tions speak louder than words.
There is something lacking.” ,

McCloud works with W&L’s black
students as the advisor to the Minority
Student Association.

“I would like to have as many African-
Americans as possible and mean it when
we say it,” she added. “Having a critical
mass of African-American students would
help black students adjust to the campus
and give other students a greater opportu-
nity to interact with African—American stu-
dents.” -

Both McCloud and DeLaney agree that more black

' faculty are needed to improve W&L’s atmosphere.

“We obviously have a bad situation as it stands now.
White students need to see black professionals just as
much as black students do,” DeLaney said. “What I
would like to see is the recruitment of well-qualiﬁed black
faculty become a carnpus-wide priority.”

While DeLaney is currently the only full-time black
professor, two black professors are teaching on one—year

 
  
 
  
  
 
   
  
 
 



contracts while they are completing their Ph.D.s. W&L
attempts to recruit minority faculty but, given the small
pool of black Ph.D.s, it is difﬁcult, said Associate Dean of
the College Cecile West-Settle.

“We are very cognizant of the fact that we want to
expose our students to wide range of ethnic backgrounds,”
she said. “We always want to enrich the academic
atmosphere on campus - to bring students in touch with
other world views - but we are looking for qualiﬁcations
and teaching abilities.”

West-Settle added that the location
of W&L probably counts against its
efforts to recruit minorities.

’ DeLaney disagrees. “Given W&L’s

. reputation, blacks who want to im-

- prove their careers are not going to
worry much about the town.”

He acknowledges the market for

recruiting black Ph.D.s is very competitive, but
“if there is a real concerted effort, the results could
be better.”

A W&L alumnus, DeLaney emphasized that
he is here because he wants to be here. He is
treated well and has “great relationships” with
students and colleagues.

His advocacy for more black professors on
campus is partially derived from
speaking with a black perspective
student and her mother who thought
black faculty is important. That
student tumed-down W&L’s offer
of admission.

“I suspect that as openings oc-

cur, people are very conscious of

the need to recruit female professors,” DeLaney

said. “I’m not sure that the same consciousness

is at play when it comes to the recruitment of
minority faculty.” ‘

W&L can work in two areas to make the
campus more conducive to black students, ac-
cording to McCloud.

First, W&L can work inter-
nally by recruiting more black fac-
ulty and emphasizing diversity
which would help all students be
more respectful of blacks. Sec-

ond, contacts can be made off-

campus in order to sell the W&L
experience to more minority students.

While McCloud will continue to try to diversify
W&L, she doesn’t see many positive changes on the
horizon.

“There are realities and there are dreams,” she said.
“My dream is that things will begin to look up for
African-Americans at W&L... but I’m afraid that I
cannot be too optimistic about the future of African-
Americans here.”

Seniors Hank Cosby, Amy Gorham and Jim Felton compete on
MSNBC’s “Remember This.”

Students ‘remember’
for game show prizes

BY KATHRYN MAYURNIK
PHI STAFF WRITER

With a little help from Bill Gates and Al
Roker, three Washington and Lee Univer-
sity seniors may be on their way to winning
W&L $25,000 in scholarship money. Amy
Gorham, Jim Felton and Hank Cosby won
two out of four games last weekend on an
MSNBC game show for college students
called “Remember This.” In addition to
winning Microsoft software and having a
few big city adventures, the trio traveled
back to New York City this past weekend to
compete in the semi-ﬁnals for the money.

The game show, hosted by Al Roker,
aired on the Microsoft/NBC cable station,
delves out a myriad of questions dealing
with history, arts, sports and ﬁlm. The three
students said Roker was as friendly as he
seems on TV.

“They are a fun group and I’m glad that
they got to be on the show,” Roker said in an
e-mail interview. “Jim is quite the
character...Hank grew up on a farm and
Amy wants to be a ﬁnancial news reporter
on TV. Jim, well, let Jim be Jim.”

In his e-mail, Roker came across like a
true people person. “I enjoy the show for

just that reason - I love talking to people and
“Remember This” gives me a chance to do
just that.”

The three students were watching the
show a few weeks ago and realized that they
could answer most of the questions. A week
later, they were winners themselves.

“On the way up to New York we studied
from this book that has the front page head-
lines from the New York Times from the

past 100 years," Gorham said. “We were
studying about Martin Luther King’s assas-
sination in the car, and we were able to
answer the question really quickly when we
had a question on it on the show.”

Although the competition was steep and
the pressure was on, the three friends were
confident. “We were jumping up and down
when we won,” Felton said. “We waited
until the cameras went off us and we did
little dances like the wave and the sprin-
kler.”

Of course, there was a little play mixed
in with all of that mind-taxing, game show
work. MSNBC put them up at The Double
Tree Suites, a luxurious hotel overlooking
Times Square. When they thanked the
MSNBC guest coordinator who made the
reservation, his response was, “Sorry, I ran
out of cardboard boxes.”

And to dispel all those myths that people
meet movie stars when they go to New
York, Gotham, Felton and Cosby only saw
“Friends” star Matthew Perry in a posh
establishment called Au Bar, where the
company was impressive and a bottle of
water costs $15. “We didn’t go up to meet
him because of what happened with Chris
O’DonneIl getting swarmed at the Parents
Weekend tailgate,” Gotham said.

The three plan on holding up a sign in
front of the ‘Today Show” window this
Monday to promote the show, and maybe
for a little more air time.

Tune in to MSNBC, channel 40, next
Saturday and Sunday at 7:30 p.m., to see
Gotham, Felton and Cosby show a New
York game show how we do it in Lexing-
ton.

 
     

Women plan improvements

BY TARAH GRANT
PHI News EDITOR

Lack of a women’s studies program, the
present women’ s center facilities and a male
biased judicial system are the top concerns
of Washington and Lee University women,
according to attendees of last Thursday
night’s Women’s Forum.

Forty-one women attended the meeting?“
held in the University Center. Treasurer"

Katie Moore, who believes that W&L
women are “obviously not treated that well,”
wants women to voice their concerns and
then improve the situation. She. opened
forum by asking attendees, “What_=pisses

Sophomore Erin Kraal started the r
cussion by commenting on the proposal f

a new Women’ s Center. The proposal letter.-

explains that the current Women’ 5 Center

None of the Women’s Forum meeting
this year were held in the current Women’
Center in the basement of the University
Center or in the Women's Suite in Gaines.

Kraal then volunteered to organize ac-
ti_vities to be held in the suite.

   
     
 
  
  
  
   
   
  
  
 
 

Next, attendees discussed the possibility
of founding a women's studies program.

“Ireallywanttotakeafeminismcourseand
we just don’t have it,” Kendra Archer said.

Sarah Meldrum explained this was a
goal of Women’ s Forum last year, however,
when they conducted a survey to promote
the idea, some professors responded with
“extremely derogatory comments."

’  t Archer volunteered to ﬁnd professors to

teach classes on women’s issues.

The final discussion of the evening cen-
tered on how the university handles crimes
against women. “Males receive worst pun-
ishment for vandalism than for sexual as-
sault,” Junior Cathy Haddock said.

 Moore pointed out that it would be con-
dered an honor violation if a rape victim
' amed other women about a particular
male. The university policy is students
pn’,t discuss a Student Conduct Commit-
issue”.

Women’s Forum hopes to address this
pic in-depth at aC1ime Bill informational
meeting on March 25. The officers believe
W&L is not following the correct proce-
dures whenhandlingcrimes againstwomen.

They plan to invite “administrators who

might be best educated by the presenta-
tion,” said Moore.

Suite, Gaines 305, at 6:30 p.m. Feb. 11.

«SCC reverses decision

BY KATHRYN MAYURNIK
PHI STAFF WRITER

A change in witness testimony prompted
the Student Conduct Committee to reverse
their Jan. 14 decision to automatically sus-
pend a Washington and Lee University
sophomore male. The student was charged
with trespassing, verbal intimidation and
harassment. The infraction occurred in
November and was alcohol related.

The witness did not necessarily reverse
his or her testimony, SCC member Paul
Saboe says. Although Saboe cannot reveal
the nature of the testimony, he did say that
a ruling could be reversed if the witness
merely changed the testimony in mood in
tone.

The student appealed to the University
Board of Appeals after the SCC’s decision
to suspend the student Winter Term and
institute social probation and restriction
from a particular dorm Spring Term. The
student now can remain at school, but must
perform 45 hours of community service.
The SCC held to its original ruling of dorm
probation and social probation for the re-
maining year. The student will remain on

conduct probation through the 1998 Spring
Term.

Saboe says that SCC members keep their
“eyes and ears” open for probation infractions.
If, for example, a member sees this student at
FD, or even at the “General’s Monkey,” he
will be automatically suspended from school.

The SCC has taken the matter of con-
duct more seriously this year. resulting in
more hearings and stricter penalties, Saboe
says. The committee is also paving the way
for the new Student Judicial Committee,
which some predict will have as much
power as the Executive Committee. Some
students feel it would have too much power.

“We’re adults now, and we don‘t need
people to tell us how to act,” Junior Justin
Riedell said. “Idon’tthinkthatwe shouldhave
a committee watching over our shoulders.”

However, Saboe says that the new SJC
will in fact curb the SCC’s power. Cur-
rently, when an appeal is made, it is turned
over to the University Board of Appeals for
review. The Board can only advise the
SCC, but the committee can act on its own.
When an appeal is made to the new SJ C, the
University Board of Appeals can oppose
the SJC verdict.

“Hypothetically, the SCC could accuse

FEBRUARY 3, 1997

Clinton’s address falls short of expectations

“You are questioning Bubba?,” a dis-
belief-stricken Republican friend recently
asked me when I offered my critical ap-
praisal of Clinton’s Inaugural Address.
But I certainly have the right to do so;
while I am a liberal and a Democrat, the

From the Left
Laura Knapp ’99

combination of the two does not auto-
matically or necessarily make me a com-
plete and utter “Clintonophile.” I do be-
lieve that Clinton was the best choice
this pastNovember (especially when con-
sidering the other candidates) but that
distinction does not put him above re-
proach. I concede that Clinton definitely
has a long road ahead if he even dreams
to secure a positive legacy for himself.
He definitely stumbled on his first step
with his less—than—auspicious Inaugural
Address. However, Clinton’s problems

are indeed the same as those of modern
leadership — a success in recognizing
the problem but a failure to propose a
way to go about solving it.

In his firstinaugural address, Franklin
Roosevelt promised “A new deal for the
American people,” and inadvertently set
a precedent that would be evident even in
Clinton’s address. FDR used this first
speeches a way to quell the fears of the
Depression-struck Americans. While it
identified the problem of mass unem-
ployment and wide-spread poverty, the
speech did not set forth a clear plan of
action.

The same can be said for Clinton’s
address. However, given the track record
from his first administration,Clinton will
never achievethe same degree ofsuccess
as FDR. Clinton needed to clear and
forceful, qualities that will be essential
for the next four years while waging a
fight for change against unrelenting Re-
publican congressmen. Instead, his

speech is replete with breezy, insubstan-
tial verbiage, invoking only half-hearted
patriotism and profound puzzlement

“The Amrican
people elected
Clinton to lead,
not to fall back

into the ranks

with the general
citizenry. ”

about what the future might hold.
Clinton uses lofty phrases like
“Guided by the ancientvision ofa prom-

ised land, let us set our sight upon a land
of new promise,” and conjures Utopian-
Sequa visions like, ‘‘In this new land,
education will be ever citizen’s most
prized possession. Our schools will have
the highest standards the world, igniting
the spark of possibility in the eyes of
every girl and boy. . .Our streets echo
again with the laughter of our children,
because no one will try to shoot them or
sell them drugs anymore.”

While all that he does say sounds
wonderful and desirable, Clinton does
not offer any specific measures of HOW
to go about achieving such dreams. He is
setting the American people’s standards
too high and disappointment is thus in-
evitable.

Clinton states that “Government is
not the problem and government is not
the solution. We — the American people

—- are the solution.” Yet again, exactly
HOW we are the solution and what ex-
actly we can do is left to our own imagi-

nations. ,

The American people elected Clinton
to lead, not to fall, back into ranks with
the general citizenry. It appears as though
our president does not even possess an
inkling of HOW the problems he so art-
fully outlined could or will be solved.
Clinton’s “Bridge to the 21st Century”
looks something like the overpass in
“Speed” —- dangerously incomplete and
desperate for a miracle.

However, in the tradition of l0-step
programs, recognition of the problem is
always the first and most important step.
The problems facing the United States
are age-old. Every president and genera-

tion of American since FDR have '

grappled with them, all with varying
degrees of success. So my often harsh
analysis should be tempered with the
understanding that there is only so much
a president can do.

I miliar with the book, it is a best-
 selling guide for women on how
: to snag and marry a man. It is
‘ also one of the stupidest books I

have ever seen. Among the rules
the book lists are, “Don’t call a
man and rarely return his phone

“Never accept a weekend date

The basic premise of the book is
that if you act like you don’t like

Besides the many things that

member, smart is sexy.” Yep,
that’s exactly what I’m thinking
when I pick up my Spanish book:
damn, I’m sexy. More impor-
tantly, the entire focus of the book
is not only on finding a man, but
getting him to marry you. I imag-
ine that most people who come to
W&L are not planning on getting
married any time soon (I know I
wasn’t, in spite of the fact that I
have now chosen my china pat-
tern).

But Valentine’s Day is coming
soon, not to mention Fancy Dress.
Who wouldn’t appreciate a little
help in finding a guy? Which is
why this week, I’m making my
own rules.

1. Decorate your room to
impress men. When he drops
by, he’ll be way impressed to see
some clay skeet pigeons peeking
out from your closet and a thing
of Skoal on your bedside table. It
might also be a good idea to have
a copy of the Victoria’s Secret
catalog in plain view. You don’t
have to actually own anything in
it, but he’ll stay with you for
months waiting for you to sur-
prise him with a black lace
bustier. Better still, set a copy of
the’ Jenny McCarthy Playboy
video on top of you VCR. You can
tape Melrose Place over it; it
doesn’t matter. All you really need
is the case. He’ll either hang out
because he likes being around
Jenny or because he thinks you’re
bisexual. Either way, you win. If
he ever asks you why you have it,
say something vague like, “I like
to work out to it.” He’ll be putty in
your hands.

2. Spend as much time at
his place as possible. Those
otherRules suggest you play hard
to get and make him come to you.
They are obviously missing the
great bonuses of spending as
much time at his place as pos-
sible. You’ll never have to clean
your room, since you’ll never be
there. Free fraternity house
lunches will save you a fortune.
And even if you don’t like this
particular guy that much, if he

lives with a bunch of other guys,
you might hit it off with one of
them.

3. Be sure to drink. Drunk
is sexy. The advice that other
book gave about how you should
study and be smart is good and
all, but guys really like to drink.
Why not associate yourself with

“Why not
associate
yourself with
one of their

favorite
hobbies?”

one of their favorite hobbies?
Later on you can impress him
with your knowledge of the Peri-
odic Table of Elements. . . after
you get his attention by slam-
ming some J agermeister.

4. Special Rules for Date
Functions: Anywhere from one
to two weeks from a date func-
tion, hook up with as many guys
as possible. Chances are, one of
them will ask you. Now, I know
that “hooking up” is a pretty
vague term, and that it can mean
anything from kissing to some-
thing involving a trapeze. All I
can say is that the more inclusive
your definition of hooking up is,
the better your chances. Sure,
people might talk about you after
you hook up with the entire wres-
tling team, but people might talk
about you if you didn’t go to FD,
too. This way at least you get a
tea-shirt out of the deal.

5. Final Rule: Be yourself.
The other Rules are trying to
keep you from appearing to be
man crazed, slutty, and desper-
ate. But if you are man craze,
slutty, and desperate, then go
with it! Best of luck—and have
fun.

Sometimes the
best publications .
make mistakes

It is scandalous and outragous
to think that one person was
given enough power to do so much
damage. Mr. Hershey didn’t just
lose $4,000 he damaged the repu-
tation of our newspaper. What is
he guilty of ? Not doing his job.
That’s right. He just didn’t do his

Life on the Hill
C. E. Miller ’98

job. The Publications Board
couldn’t do anythingbut ﬁre him,
and he actually resigned before
that happened.

I don’t know Mr. Hershey per-
sonally and I don’t mean this to
be a personal attack. There are
several-problems with this whole
situation that don’t involve Mr.
Hershey’s neglect of his duties.

First, where are the checks
and balances in this system? I
want to know why nobody no-
ticed before local merchants be-
gan to close accounts that thePhi
was broke. If a student writes a
bad check, the Cold Check Com-
mittee goes into action.

The check is covered, the stu-
dent notified and the situation
resolved. This system allows the
students of Washington and Lee
University to write checks in
Lexington without showing
three pieces of I.D. and turning
over rights to his first-born. It
doesn’t work that way in my
hometown. Check-writing is a
very painful and tedious pro-
cess, often only used when the
bill comes for those 10 CD’s for
the price of one deal.

The account was $1400 over-
drawn. Wow, if I did that at my
bank, I think I would be arrested.
No kidding. I received threaten-
ing phone calls for a month when
I was $15.32 overdrawn.

The loss in advertising rev-
enue is perhaps the worst blow
of all. The Phi is not an indepen-
dent newspaper. The Phi does
rely on money from the execu-
tive committee, but its advertis-
ing revenue gives The Phi free-
dom to improve the paper be-
yond the basic four-page color-
less edition that was put out last
week. It allows the freedom to
use excess funds to purchase
badly needed equipment, and

many hours they put into their
jobs.

I want to compliment the Pub-
lications Board on the quick and
decisive action that was taken as
soon as the problem was discov-
ered. Darcey Livingston did a
fabulous job fixing the mess cre-
ated by Mr. Hershey’s neglect.

Now a more serious note. I
was almost embarrassed that our
scandal was aired in The Trident
it was if thePhi ignored the prob-
lem so no one would find out
about it.

I will not make any accusa-
tions but still I feel it should
have been covered here first. To
allow a rival paper to air our
dirty laundry is wrong. Much
respect could have been earned
if thePhi had owned up to its
problems. ‘ ii

I am not an editor any
longer, so I don’t have say in
what goes in or out of the pa-
per that I write for. If my edi-
tors think I am attacking them
in a large part they are right.
the Phi has a reputation
among the professors and the
community as being the place
to get the news.

We don’t print pictures of
butts on the front page, we
don’t allow our columnists to
continually attack the same
organization, and we don’t ca-
ter to those who want easy
reading.

If thePhi is going to main-
tain that reputation we need
to own up to our own prob-
lems. This is not the opinion
of the editorial staff of this
paper. This is my opinion as a
former editor, and a devoted
journalist.

Everyone on campus knows
that The Trident is a great
student newspaper. It is how-

ever different from the Phi.

We have 99 years of tradition
behind us, and there are ex-
pectations for our behavior. I
think this time the Phi let
down these expectations.

We hired a business man-
ager who didn’t do his job,
and nobody noticed. The local
merchants are very forgiving,
I hope we can keep that re-
spect after this.

I like writing for thePhi, I
stand up for it, but in stand-
ing up for it I need to call it as

guished Gentleman.”
Browne’s comedic perfor-
mance is one ofseveral Black

sational humor of The
General’s Monkey, go see
The Have Nots! on Friday,
February 7, at 8 p.m. in the
Johnson Theater. The Have
Nots! consistsof a ﬁve-mem-
ber improvisational comedy
troupe. According to the
group’s press release, “the
show is a fast paced interac-
tive adventure into what the
company can make up right
before your eyes.”

Sandy Katz, a reviewer for
Charleston’s Free Time, de-
scribes the members of The
Have Nots! as “talented funny,

funny ﬁne comedic perform-
ers.” Katz adds, “This entire
troupe has a refined quality
you see among the best enter-
tainers.”

The Friday’s! Committee
is sponsoringThe Have Nots!
performance. Robert Taylor,
Press Chair for The Friday’s!
Committee, commented that
the show exemplifies the
committee’s new program-
ming. According to Taylor,
the committee’s new pro-
gramming is more geared to
the type of entertainment
whichstudentsindicatedthey

Hollis Leddy, president of the SAB,
said thatthisideaisn’t new: the SAB puton

idea came from a student interviewing for
the SAB who mentioned that her high
school had a pudding wrestling competi-
tion. The event is supplied by a company
called RTA. They make all the pudding,
which is totally edible, themselves. The

company offersachoice between pudding
andJell-O wrestling, butinordertowrestle
in Jell-O, the school would have to pro-
vide 140to 160 poundsof ice, Leddy said.

The event is open to all students, fac-
ulty, and staff. Participants must sign a
contract and adhere to a dress code: at
least shorts and tee-shirts worn by both
men and women. Men will only wrestle
men,andwomenwillonlywrestlewomen.

Participants can decide to go tag-team or
solo. An emcee will introduce the wres-
tlers, and a referee will determine the win-
ners.

“It’ll be a lot of fun,” I_eddy said.
“People really get into it. There wasa huge
student response last time, and we’re ex-

BY ANNE ALVORD
PHI EXECUTIVE EDITOR

I’ll be honest. My luck with men lately
hasbeenlessthan plentiful. Not thatldon’t
have men chatting me up: it just never
seems to go anywhere good. Iwas talking
to a friend of mine about it a few weeks
ago. She said she’s more or less in the
sameboat. But she wastakingaction. She
bought The Rules: Time-tested Secrets
for Capturing theHeart ofMr. Right, and
recommended it to me. So I borrowed it
and read it.
The authors of The Rules, Ellen Fein
and Sherrie Schneider, explain that The
Rules began as a “secret underground”, a
network of women helping women. The
catch was that because the network was
entirely through word of mouth, some
women were getting The Rules wrong.
Fein and Schneider decided to write the
rules down, so there would be no
more mistakes.
At first, l found it nothing short of

ridiculous. “Rule #2: Don’t Talk to a
Man First (and Don’t Ask a Man to
Dance.” “Rule #12: Break Up With
Him if He Doesn’t Buy You a Roman-
tic Gift forYour Birthday orValentine’s
Day.” “Rule #20: Be Honest But
Mysterious.” That’s just a sample.

I was reminded of my grandmother,
and her own personal set of rules that
she passed on to my mother and to me.
The man you marry has to be two years
older than you, she says, and he has to
be the exact height which allows your
head to rest perfectly on his shoulder.

I quickly realized that The Rules
was written for women who are a lot
more desperate than l am. There are
chapters, for example, on how to write
and answer personal ads. Plus, the
overall theme of the book is how to get

a man to marry you. I quote from Rule
#32: Don’t Break the Rules, “...The Rules
is not a hobby, but a religion. We keep
doing The Rules until the ring is on our
finger!” ln answer to the question “Will
he still marry me if I break The

Rules?” the answer, “Maybe yes, but
probably no.”

The Rules don’t apply to me, or to
most W&L women, on the grand scale
(for more on this, see “GreenLand”, page
2), but the book isn ’t worthless. There are

some valid points that we need to be
reminded of. The essence of the message
isthis: beconfident, take care of yourself,
and remember you don’t need a man.
Know who you are, and the rest
comes naturally.

Men split pair of

BY SUZANNE SCOTT
PHI STAFF WRITER

It was a disappointing week-
end for the Washington and Lee
women’sswim—

The loss to Mary Washing-
ton was a discouraging 122-68.
Freshman Brooke Stanley set a
new record of 25.28 seconds in
the 50-yard freestyle event. This
lone triumph was not enough to
bring the Generals to victory.

The previous night, the
women lost a tough meet to
Sewanee, 105-100. Sophomore
Margaret Hoehl led the team by
capturing three events.

and junior Steve Brigance each
took three events Friday. Fresh-
man Jared Fribush and Brigance
were victorious Saturday in the
50 and 100—yard events, respec-
tively.

Of Saturday’s meet, Fribush
said, “We didn’t do as well as
we would have liked to have
done. Probably because we were
tired from last night’s meet
against Sewanee.”

The women’s team is 7-6 in
dual meets with one more left to
go. Its next meet will be on
February 11 at 6:30 p.m. at
Hollins.

The men’s team is 7-4 in dual
meets this season. Its next meet
will be at the SCAC Invitational

D-hall workers arrested for drugs

BY KATHRYN MAYURNIK
PHI STAFF WRITER

Two weeks ago the Washington and Lee University
Dining Hall workers performed “Sister Act” for the
Lip Sych Contest. But the act was over Tuesday for
Vera Merchant, and assistant manager at the Dining
Hall and mother of a thirteen-year-old boy, when she
was arrested for possession of cocaine and marijuana.
Dining Hall cook Shawn Brown was also arrested for
possession of marijuana.

Members of the Rockbridge Regional Drug Task
Force confiscated cocaine and marijuana from Mer-
chant, two former catering employees, and a juvenile

in her apartment over City Steaks and Subs on Sept. 5,
1996. The Rockbridge grand jury indicted Merchant
and the others Monday after the Task Force produced
the lab results. ‘~

Merchant and Brown continue to work at the Din-
ing Hall. “This week the Personnel Services will
determine what will be done,” Director of Dining
Services Gerald Darrell said.

The arrests were the result of a six to nine month
undercover Task Force investigation, which ended in
27 arrests on 46 counts. Charges include possession
and distribution of cocaine and marijuana, and posses-
sion of various prescription medicines.

The undercover investigation was prompted

by complaints by local residents who suspected
their neighbors were either dealing or using drugs.
Two or three drug “rings” were broken up by the
arrests.

“We think we got them all,” Chapel said. “But the
usual scenario is that once one is taken out, another
one ﬁlls his shoes right away.”

The Rockbridge Regional Drug Task Force is a
cooperative effort between the Lexington and Buena
Vista Police Departments, the Rockbridge County
Sheriff’ s Ofﬁce, and the Virginia State Police Bureau
of Investigation.

Since 1994, the Task Force has seized $754,296.00

addressed to SAC members (Sandy Hooper, Robert Covington,
Anthony Mazzarelli, Sara Benson, Dan Campbell, or Eliza-
beth Cox).

I RELIGION DEPT. HOLDS LECTURE:

‘ Emergence of the Interpretive Perspective in the Study of
Religion.”

The lecture will be sponsored by the Phillip F. Howerton
Fund for Special Programs and is open to the public. Peacock
,, will also lead a faculty seminar during his stay at W&L.

CONSORTIUM OFFERS PROJECTS:

The plans to put sorority women in the former Delta

Dean Leroy “Buddy” Atkins attended the Lexington
City Council meeting last Thursday, to present a public

Economics professor
signs petition against  
Balanced Budget

BY B.J. WALKER
PHI STAFF WRITER

One of the most debated, and popu-
lar, initiatives of the 105th Congress is
the proposed Balanced Budget Amend-
ment. Supported by practically all of
the GOP majority and a large portion
of the Democrats, the Amendment is
almost assured passage. To most
Americans the proposal seems like a
good idea-—preventin g the government
from engaging in the reckless spend-
ing of the Reagan-Bush era. Some
economist are, however, doubtful.

At the recent meeting of the Ameri-
can Economic Association, over 1,100
leadingeconomist, including 11 Nobel
laureates, signed a petition, which has
been reprinted in full-page ads in most
leading papers across the country, eon-
demning the measure as “unsound and
unnecessary.” On the list was Washing-
ton and Lee Professor Art Goldsmith.

“l’m opposed to simply because its
not prudent,” said Goldsmith. His
opposition is grounded in the belief
that a required budget, especially in
times of economic recession, would
be disastrous to the economy.

“The government has set up auto-
matic stabilizers (unemployment in-
surance, welfare, etc.) that protects

the economy. When people loseltheimw--public7e consciousness, but it would be

jobs, the stabilizers keeps them up.
The amendment would force expendi-

ture to follow taxes. When the economy
slows down, taxes would fall. That’s
the time the government most needs to
be spending. The government would
have less to spend on stabilizers and
the economy would only worsen.”
“The more important issue is the
composition of government expendi-
tures, not the amount. If government is
spending on infrastructure, education,
training, and things like that, down the
road, we will be much more produc-
tive.” One likely explanation for the
strength of the current American
economy is the large investments that
corporations made at the beginning of
the decade, during a recession.
Another oonoem is with government
bonds. Goldsmith feels if the Balanced
Budget Amendment were to get rid of
govemmentbondsmany peoplewhomight
use such bonds to safely save for college
would no longer be have this option.
“There aretimesasurpluswilloccur,
just as a debt will at times occur. Both
are natural and possible in the future.”
As for Congress’ fascination with
the issue, Goldsmith notes “it may be
good politics, but it’s bad economics.
1,100 economists agree.”
He does look favorable on the debate
over the issue. ‘‘I think all the debate has
been healthy because it’s raised the

unwise to offset the good that the gov-
ernment can do in times of recession.”

First black student
recalls W&Llife

BY AARON FOLDENAUER
PHI STAFF WRITER

Dennis Haston, raised in Lexington and
now a high school mathematics teacher, broke
the racial barrier that encompassed Washing-
ton and Lee University for decades.

The first black undergraduate who attended
W&L in the 20th century, Haston matriculated
in 1966 and left in 1967.

Theonly black before him wasJohn Chavis,
who attended the College in the late 18th
century.

“Washington and Lee was more challeng-
ing academically than socially,” Haston said
in a recent telephone interview. “I struggled.
I had roughly Cs and D5. In certain areas, I was

not ready for the challenge.”

Haston, who lived off-campus at his home,
said he was generally treated well but had a
few problems.

“I sensed sometimes that I was not wanted,”
he said. ‘‘I also thought I was discriminated
against by one of my professors. The way he
talked to me, graded my papers, the whole
atmosphere. But back then I didn’t retaliate. I
just went with the program.”

For a variety of reasons, he decided to
transfer to Bluefield State College. But this
brief stint at W&L wasn’t the only first for
Haston.

“When I came to Winchester in 1970, I was
the only black in the whole system,” Haston
said. “I was the first black to do a lot ofthings.
You just can’t give in.”

EDITORS, from page 3

The Southern Collegian, according
to Resmer, is more of a Mad magazine
than a Mother Jones.

“It’s a humor magazine with a vari-
ety of short stories, poems, journalism,
and comedy.” said Resmer.

The magazine’s first female editor,
Resmer paired up withvco-editor Alex
Christensen to inject diversity and cre-
ativity into the world of campus publi-
cations. Efforts such as Winter Rush
and the Fridays! Committee, in
Resmer’s opinion, are attempts by the
university to artificially spawn creativ-
ity. Such creativity needs to come
from within; hence, the Collegian.

Her magazine seeks to provide a
forum where students can thoughtfully
discuss controversial matters instead
of shouting back and forth at each other
on the Op-ed page of The Trident. Her
personal editorial philosophy is to cel-
ebrate diversity while simultaneously
preserving W&L’s conservative heri-
tage. Although she wants to rid the
campus of a climate of hatred, she's
opposed to the sophist arguments of
political correctness. It is not her aim
to transform the university into Oberlin,
Part II.

Jenkins took over as editor-in-chief
of the Spectator last March after a year
in which the magazine took a low pro-
file.

“Our purpose is to put out commen-
tary on campus issues and relevant na-
tional issues,” said Jenkins. “Our con-
servative slant is a reflection of the
nature of our staff and what we believe
needs to be discussed.”

The magazine has opposed Winter
Rush and infringements upon student
autonomy. It is known for pokingfunat
Dean Anne Schroer-Lamont and controver-
sial campus organizations such as G&L.
Jenkins believes it is wrong for students to
take themselves too seriously.

According to Jenkins, no campus
organization, including the Spectator,
is above public scrutiny.

Jenkins uses his magazine to stand
behind Greek life on campus. Fraterni-
ties and sororities, according to Jenkins,
help provide structure for the students,
especially freshmen who might other-

wise fall through the cracks.

“Pledgeship is a good thing,” said
Jenkins. “A healthy, reasonable pro-
gram inspires self-confidence and im-
proves solidarity.”

Like most freshmen, both Resmer
and Jenkins underwent a culture shock
of sorts when first arriving in Lexing-
ton. But both believe their four years
‘at W&L have changed them for the
better. , _

“As a freshman, I felt like an out-
sider,” said Resmer. “I learned that
the best way to deal with that was not
to shut myself out of the system but to
work within it. W&L trained me to be
a better activist because I live with the
people who oppose my ideas.”

According to Jenkins, his first six
months were a tough transitional time

/as well:

“I was immature four years ago, but
now I feel like I’ve developed person-
ally. I've increased my knowledge,
my self-confidence, and my sense of
professionalism.”

Above all, Resmer appreciates the
civility among W&L students. In her
opinion, this is unique to the school.
On most other campuses, she believes,
rational discussion of controversial is-
sues is obstructed by a lack of respect
among peers. Jenkins agrees. The
campus is a, place where informative
exchanges can occur without the weight
of political correctness. He believes
this is the difference between W&L
and other top liberal arts schools.

Armed with conviction and enthusi-
asm, both Resmer and Jenkins are
poised for greatness. Next year,
Resmer will be working in Chicago for
the Fund for Public Interest Research,
an environmental and consumer lob-
bying group. Jenkins will be in New
York City working as an investment banker
for what was Morgan Stanley before the
merger with Dean Witter last week.

In twenty years, Resmer sees herself
as a celebrated author and poet; Jenkins
sees himself in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. And, despite the gulf of
differences that will continue to sepa-
rate them, both will always remember
W&L fondly, knowing that their ef-
forts here helped to preserve an insti-
tution they love.

“The Rainmaker” storms into Lenfest

BY ANDREA EWING
PHI FEATURES EDITOR

Today is your last chance to
see the Lenfest Center make
rain.

Yes, it does rain, but this is
not the most impressive ele-
ment in the Washington and
Lee Theatre Department’s in-
terpretation of N. Richard
Nash’s play “The Rainmaker.”

 

Professor J. D. Martinez di-
rects the play, which is set in
“a western state on a sum-
mer day in a time of
drought,” according to the
playbill. No specific setting
is given: a set giving the il-
lusion of a house with no
solid walls could be any
house. However, the charac-
ters are not just any characters.
The characters define the ac-
tion, and a finely written text

allows the actors to explore
the inner drive of each.

Lizzie Curry, portrayed by
Maria Hardin, is a plain girl
with no self-confidence. Hardin
comments on the character in
the “Curtain Call:” “Lizzie
doesn’t know how to be a
woman - she isn’t comfortable
with who she is - and that makes
it difficult for her to be roman-
tically involved with a man.”
Hardin gave a convincing per-
formance displaying an excel-
lent understanding of the char-
acter. Her expressions said
more than the delivered lines.

The Rainmaker, Bill
Starbuck, is a lively and bois-
terous con man who promises
the Curry family a thunder
shower in exchange for $100.
Starbuck knows the human
heart and plays off emotion to
achieve his goal. Drew Higgs,
as Starbuck, enters proclaim-
ing that even if he is crazy the
family must believe or rain will
not fall. Higgs has matured as
an actor, and the depth presented
in Starbuck reﬂects this new
maturity.

These two main characters
come into conflict when
Lizzie’s father, H. C. Curry
played by Tommy Spencer,
hires Starbuck. Lizzie knows

W&life

he is a con man, but his talk of
dreams seems to make a drab
reality glitter. Lizzie’s simple
dreams seem as unattainable as
the grand claims made by
Starbuck.

The remainder of the family
consists of two brothers: Dan
Tipton is the older brother,
Noah, a harsh, highly critical
man who runs the ranch, and
Sam Levine plays the dim-wit-
ted but endearing younger
brother, Jimmy.

Joe Merlino as File the
Deputy Sheriff, a man facing
the reality of a failed marriage,
and Brian Prisco as Sheriff Tho-
mas round out the cast.

A blend of well-casted ac-
tors and excellent set appear-
ance bring the performance sen-
sual appeal. Live harmonica
music played by Lee Sauder
lends a “down-home” feeling
to the play. The music adds
feeling to scenes and character,
yet it is so understated that it
does not overpower the perfor-
mance.

Nash writes about love and
the power of faith in oneself.
“The Rainmaker” allows the
audience for a time to enter the
lives of a family where miracles
can happen. Martinez brings
this family to life on stage.

PHI STAFF WRITER

Cathy Resmer and Tim Jenkins both
wear green corduroys, listen to classical
music and drink coffee. And that’s
about where their similarities end.

Resmer edits the Southern Collegian,
a student magazine with a decidedly

“1ib'e'ral"beii’t; JeiiI<'iﬁ§”éEiit’s"tl1"é"S'”peE7iiio'r”,"’ 

the Collegian ’s conservative counterpart.
Both Washington and Lee seniors use
their publications to spark debate on
campus and to expand the political dis-
course. In the age of so-called Genera-
tion X-er slackerhood, Resmer and
Jenkins buck the stereotype. Indeed,
whether they choose to realize it or not,

they are activists in the truest sense of the
word: those who take vigorous action or
involvement as a means of achieving
political goals.

Resmer, an English major from
Eastpointe, Michigan, hasn’t always been
a liberal feminist. In high school, she
considered herself a conservative Re-
publican.

“I just didgwhat my parents did“,’_’.she

“§aiEi’." " "‘“Tl"{e'ﬁ,"l"vV6lEé”up' and began to

think for myself.”

Since then, Resmer has championed
traditionally liberal causes. In 1992, she
campaigned for presidential candidate
Bill Clinton, canvassing for votes in her
neighborhood. She’s pro-choice, anti-
death penalty, and supports gay rights.
She believes Ronald Reagan was an “im-

age president” who set our country back.
Her heroes include consumer advocate
Ralph Nader, Madonna, and folk singer
Ani DiFranco. Typically dressed in black
Doc Martens and baggy ﬂannels, Resmer
speaks with the intensity of someone
who’s convinced she’s right.

Jenkins, a senior European history
and politics major from Rochester, Min-
neusota, has always been a conservative
Republican. He jokes about his G.O.P.

President Reagan sits on his television.
His heroes include his family, George
Washington, and Robert E. Lee. In 1996,
he voted for Bob Dole because he thought
Dole was the best man for the job. He
says he doesn’t like abortion but supports

a woman’s right to choose, supports capi-

Jenkins looks and sounds like the pro-

His voice is deep and resonates like that

Comet Ha e-Bopp brightens

BY DAVID BALSLEY
PHI FEATURES EDITOR

Star-minded students of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity will have a new subject to which they can turn
their attention during the next few months. Comet
Hale-Bopp will be visible over the eastern horizon
throughout February, March and April.

According to The Washington Post, Comet Hale-
Bopp’s rare appearance has excited some astrono-
mers. Because Hale-Bopp travels a path which ex-
tends out of our local solar system, into interplanetary
space and back again, it visits Earth only once every
four thousand years. In addition, Hale-Bopp promises
to be one of the more visible comets to pass Earth.

“If it lives up to its billing, it should be more
obvious than most comets of this century,” said Pro-
fessor Reese, Professor of Physics. “Halley’s Comet
was pathetic in comparison.”

Hale-Bopp will be visible to the naked eye. Reese
suggests that students who would like a closer view of
the comet forego the use of telescopes. Instead,
students should use binoculars to view Hale-Bopp.
According to Reese, telescopes would allow students
to only see a part of the comet, whereas binoculars
would allow students to view Hale-Bopp in
its entirety.

Put on your dancing shoes and
dance the Polonaise? Well, not
exactly!

On Sunday, the International
Club hosted the Micha’s Polish
Folk Ensemble. The group, which
consists of ten dancers from the
Norfolk area, has been dancing
for about a decade. Although the
folk ensemble concentrates on
Polish folk dancing, their reper-
toire also includes many dances
from around the world.

The program began at 3:00 p.m.

used in the show. Next, the en-
semble performed dances from
several folk regions of Poland,
then finished by teaching the au-
dience dances from Poland, Is-
rael, Germany, French Canada and
the United States.

The Michas Ensemble is the first
of a series of folk dances which
the International Club will host
this year. The next program will
be Hungarian Dancing, hosted on
March 2. In addition to dancing,
this group will feature live village
music and a multimedia presenta-
tion of Hungarian folk traditions.

The early bird gets the comet:

Students interested in seeing Hale-Bopp
should look to the eastern morning sky.

“It’s really best viewed without a telescope,”
said Reese.

Reese has offered to allow students of W&L to use
the university’s binoculars to look at the comet. If the
weather prediction for the next day is good, students
should see Reese to sign out the binoculars
that afternoon.

Comet Hale-Bopp can be seen before sunrise (at
about 6:00 a.m.). Reese advises that students look due

morning skies

east for three bright stars in a triangular pattern located
twenty degrees above the horizon. (When you look
straight up into the sky, you are looking up at an angle
of ninety degrees. The three stars, then, should appear
about one-fourth of the way into the sky.) These stars
consist the Summer Triangle. Comet Hale-Bopp should
be visible along the line which connects the bottom
two stars.

Comet Hale-Bopp will look like a little smudge,
with its tail trailing vertically above it. Including its
tail, Hale-Bopp is about the same size as the Moon.

You will be better able to see Hale-Bopp if your
surroundings are fairly dark. According to Reese, the
main campus of W&L is too brightly-lit to afford a
good view of the comet. Reese reccomends that
students go to Liberty Hall and look to the mountains
in order to see Hale-Bopp. Also, the comet will be
more visible if the Moon is in a dark phase.

Starting next month, Reese will help groups of
students see the comet.

“Some time in March, we’ll drag out one of our
portable telescopes so students can look at the nucleus,”
said Reese.

Until then, Reese reccomends that students ask
astronomy students to help them find Hale-Bopp.

Take a break from your all-nighter to look at Comet
Hale-Bopp. You only get a chance like this once every
few thousand years.

BY ALEX CHRISTENSEN
PHI MovIE CRITIC

Rarely has a movie seemed so out of place in the market-
place. It’s being hyped like a big—budget “issue movie,” much
like “Dead Man Walking” was, or like such older, sort of
dopey but well intentioned efforts like “Gentleman’s Agree-
ment” or “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner.” Fair or unfair as
that categorization might be to those ﬁlms, it’s downright
weird when applied to “The People vs. Larry Flynt.” First of
all, Larry Flynt does not succumb to anything like the kind of
“nice,” emasculated storytelling that makes everybody feel
good. The issue it’s supposed to address is censorship and the
First Amendment, and it does, sort of, but that’s not the crux
of the story.

The real story is a great, twisted love/hate affair between
Hustler magazine founder Larry Flynt (Woody Harrelson)
and the United States of America. How does this country,
which praises free speech and morality in public while con-
demning pornography, but buys pornography by the millions
in private, deal with a native son who wants to be acknowl-
edged as legitimate in public? Does standing up for free
speech and freedom of action mean endorsing perversity?
How does a capitalist society praise Flynt’s entrepreneurial
spirit without condoning his views?

Milos Forman, one of only two working directors to have
won the Best Director Oscar twice (for “One Flew Over the
Cuckoo’s Nest” and “Amadeus”), along with Oliver Stone,
“Flynt’s” producer, takes the tactic of telling Larry Flynt’s
saga like a documentary, while at the same time using a sort
of simplistic symbolism to portray the forces at work in
America at the time. In Forman’s schema, Larry Flynt is the
quintessential American. All he wants is to get ahead and to
live his life with no compromises. His wife Althea Leasure
Flynt (Courtney Love), represents the libertine who becomes
a victim of her own destructive instincts, succumbing to drug
addiction and falling victim to AIDS after years of
sexual promiscuity.

The forces of good line up on the opposite side. Charles
Keating (James Cromwell) represents the hypocritical capi-
talist who panders to another mass taste which happens to
differ from Larry Flynt’s, but is essentially the same force.
Flynt gives them unthinking sex; Keating, unthinking anti-
sex. Jerry Falwell (Richard Paul) represents the complete
hypocrite, preaching love while inculcating a visceral hatred
for sexuality which doesn’t follow his rules.

One of my favorite scenes is when some of Falwell’s
students bring him theHustler parody which mocks Falwell—
he never asks the pertinent question: “How did you find this?”
It reminds me of when my sister used to tell on me for having
my eyes open during family prayers. The perfect defense:
“How does she know?”

The most potentially fascinating character is Ruth Carter
Stapleton (Donna Hanover Giuliani, yes, the New York City
mayor’s wife), Jimmy Carter’s evangelical sister, who pro-
poses liberating sexuality from the world of smut and Chris-
tianity from the prudes. This development is violently inter-
rupted, as all great movements are.

All of these competing ideologies and forces are never
reconciled, which is painfully obvious from looking at Ameri-
can society today. People are still hysterical over other
people’s sexuality. Congress is locked in some kind of sexual
frenzy, prematurely legislating all over the House ﬂoor.
Falwell’s ilk have hijacked the Republican Party, making it
impossible to nominate a presidential candidate who can be
elected. The movie has no easy answers, but it certainly raises
all the right questions.

And the best thing is Harrelson’s performance. If Larry
Flynt has a soul, Harrelson has captured it on film. To take a
person as unlikable as Larry Flynt and make you root for him
is sheer magic. With every movement, every word, Harrelson
leads us there. While Courtney Love’s performance is not
quite the triumph some critics have hailed it as, it certainly
remains amazingly true to character. It makes the point that
however ugly sex can be, and however unlovable a person can

’be, it is love that makes things bearable.

But the real point of the film is America’s own hypocrisy.
Larry Flynt is a native son. America buys millions of his
magazines a year. But he shouldn’t be anybody’s hero. The
man admits having had sex with a chicken, for heaven’s sake!
It’s hard to come back from that to hero status. Why did
America make Larry Flynt a martyr, then, by persecuting and
prosecuting him just for holding up a mirror to our society?
We’ve got some serious issues to deal with.

The roses will be on sale Mon-

OPINION

FEBRUARY 10, 1997

President’s budget cuts other critical programs

President Clinton’s State of the Union
address last Tuesday, outlined the major
focus for his next four years: education. He
has one—upped the so-called “education presi-
dent” George Bush and proposed a dramatic
new initiative to improve our nation’s
schools. On Thursday, Mr. Clinton backed

From the Right

Jason Zacher ’98
Ring-tum Phi Editorial Editor

this proposal in his budget, increasing edu-
cation spending by 13 percent, but at what
cost?

There are few in this nation who would
say our education system is not in trouble.
Like some of the Washington and Lee stu-
dents at this school, I went to public schools
that had good teachers, but poor facilities.
With better facilities, my high school, which
already had the best test scores in the public

schools in my area, could have beat out
many more private schools also. All it takes
is a little funding.

Clinton’s first proposal of national stan-
dards for education is overdue. Though it is
clearly the states’ job to fund and run educa-
tion, many states do not make education a
priority, whether it is because of rising prison
and entitlement spending, or because of a
general cultural aversion to education. Some
national standards that school districts need
to meet is the first step toward equalizing
public education.

His second proposal, to ﬁnd and certify
the best teachers, and remove those who do
not measure up, is also overdue. Teaching
is America’s most important profession,
especially in the coming decades. The in-
credible inﬂuence the teachers’ unions in
this country prevents the poor teachers from
being fired— hopefully Clinton will weaken
the teachers’ unions through this action and
districts can remove these bad teachers.

The third and fourth proposals focus on

education for children. It is a travesty that in
our great country there are people who
cannot read. Parents need to help educate
their children, and we need to go back now
and help those who have fallen through the
cracks.

The next few proposals are full issues in
themselves. He has adopted the tradition-
ally Republican school choice issue and also
called for school uniforms, zero tolerance
for drugs and guns in school, and abroad tax
credit for college education (up to $10,000
a year after high school).

Finally, there is the challenge of linking
all schools to the Internet and $5 billion for
school improvements. Both are good pro-
posals. Like the national standards pro-
posal, these two will also help level the
playing field among public and private
schools.

The improvements in education that our
country needs so desperately come at what
cost to other programs? First, true to Demo-
cratic form, Clinton slashed our defense

spending by another 3.4 percent. This de-
spite the warnings of our current and past
Joint Chiefs that the spending has gone too
low, and we cannot fulﬁll our missions
anymore. The biggest mistake he makes is
a $2.9 billion decrease in modernization
spending. Has he forgotten what a differ-
ence modernization spending makes? Many
of our technologies from the Gulf War are
being rendered obsolete before our own
eyes. Our military advantage is steadily
decreasing due to his cuts.

The other major program that suffers is
the infrastructure program that even the
Washington Post says we desperately need.
To keep our economy the best in the world,
we need the best infrastructure. Clinton is
abandoning his ambitious plans by slashing
spending on airports, bridges, roads and
railroads. Like the defense spending cuts,
these also hurt our country’s competitive-
ness in the international arena.

If these were the losers in the budget
battle, what were the winners? Well, if a

Democraticpresidentholdsthe White House,
you guessed it: Medicare and Medicaid.
Medicare spending is slated to increase by 8
percent, and Medicaid will increase by 7.4
percent.

In what is becoming the story of the
Clinton presidency, some areas he gets so
right, and others he gets so very wrong. It is
time for the Democrats to follow the Repub-
lican lead and realize that some very tough
decisions are going to have to be made about
the entitlement spending in this country.
Without a major tax increase, something is
going to have to give. Unfortunately, Presi-
dentClinton sees ourinternational competi-
tiveness as the price. Maybe, just maybe,
with aRepublican congress, this budgetwill

correct itself. If we want to continue our
entitlement spending we will have to get it

under control, which will hurt people.

But instead of hurting a few Americans,
Clinton would rather hurt our country and
its international standing as the only super-

power in the world.

feel many ofthe wrinkles I see can
be ironed out ifistudents take an
interest in this.

Every once in a while I receive
a great response to a column. I
want to thank Dean of the College
Laurent Boetsch for responding
to my concerns about the focus of
the University’s education. He
wrote, “I share your sense of con-
fusion when you write, ‘I don’t
know if the school is failing to
educate us, or if we are failing to
educate ourselves.’ I suspect it is
some of both. The question is,
what sorts of adjustments might
we make to address what you and
I, at least, consider a problem? I
don’t know the answer, but I would
very much like to discuss it with
you and other students. . .”

My reason for writing that col-
umn was to get people to talk
about it. A professor from South-
ern Virginia College sent me an
article from the Washington Post.
The article criticized the universi-
ties and colleges that were becom-
ing obsessed with making the “‘top
ten lists.” It was a refreshing view-
point and one I hope our adminis-
trators are considering. I want to
challenge those students that are
frustrated with the heavy focus on
grade point averages and test
scores to talk about it. It is so
encouraging to know that our ad-
ministrators want to improve our
university.

Everything went wrong with
my financial aid application last
year. I ended up with much less
financial help than I had antici-
pated. This year that little form is
being hand delivered to the ladies

in financial aid. The reason I am
bringing all of this up? Well I
guess I want to know how that $1 1
million dollar grant the university
recently received is going to help
its students. I haven’t heard ofany
direct use and I don’t know what
will happen. Ijust hope the Uni-
versity doesn’t decide to put it
away and not to use.

“The key to
making the
SJC a success-
ful part of
Washington
and Lee
University ’s
campus is get-
ting the stu-
dents involved.”

Grants and letters aside, we
don’t live in a vacuum. Live a
little, buy a raffle ticket for
President Elrod’s parking
place, wave back at a townie,
go tanning to shake off those
winter blues. Everybody needs
a little time away, especially in
the middle of February. Not all
of us will be sunbathing in
Florida or skiing the slopes.
Naturally, I’m not going any-
where, but even Lexington can
be fun.

No clear

enemy

makes Betsy a
boring woman

This week, the inevitable has
happened. I have no clue to write
my column about. In fact, it’s
already overdue, and I suspect that
any minute now, Jason, my patient
editor, will be calling me to ask

GreenLand
Betsy Green ’97

where it is. That’s why I’m not
answering my phone. Who calls
me on a Sunday afternoon any-
way? Jason, and maybe my mom.
Neither ofthem is likely to give me
any blockbuster ideas.

Glenn Miller’s technique of
choosing one campus organization
and adapting each column to mock
them is a tempting one (A side
note: Iknow alot ofpeople weren’t
satisfied with the Glenn/Alex de-
bate. Who wants to see a rematch
at the chocolate pudding wrestling
match?)

But what group to pick? My
first thought was the EC, but that’s
just asking for trouble. We were
specifically told to avoid making
fun of The Tridentto give peace a
chance. (Oops.) I could make fun
of conservatives and southerners,
but that’ s Rebecca’sjob. I could
make fun of women, but Lamar
already mastered that.

Other groups on campus just
aren’t as funny. Um, let’s see...the
LIFE committee wants us to wash
our hands after using the
computers...no joke comes from
that. See what I mean? The only
thing I’m really left with is making
fun of the French or the Canadians.

What I need is a good solid
enemy. If you think it could be
you, please contact me right away
so we can start to bash each other.
Until then, I will leave you with a
potpourri of rejected column ideas.

Idea #1: An OJ Simpson wrap-
up column. Finally, the whole OJ
thing is over...until the appeal pro-
cess starts it all over again. What
are the chances of the State of the
Union Address and the verdict
coming in at the same time? I was
rather disappointed that all the net-
works took the high road and
showed President Clinton instead
of the verdict. The Fox network
could have at least shown Bill talk-
ing, but then flashed the word
“Guilty” across his face as soon as
the news came in. And how weird
is it that after Simpson was found
liable , he stopped at Baskin
Robbins on the way home? What
was he thinking? “Gee, I guess I’ll
be playing at public golf courses
instead of country clubs from now
on. Hey, ice cream!”

Why I rejected it: With the high
emotions surrounding the case, it
seems generally better not to go
there. And in trying to come up
with a funny ﬂavor of ice cream for
OJ to order, I no doubt would have
written something really tasteless.

Idea#2: My newjob. Irecently
got, and accepted, a job offer for
after graduation. This would have
been about all of the stupid ways I
could blow money and rationalize
not doing any work for the rest of
the year. Or about how I really
want to find an apartment next
year that has a cool, aristocratic
name.

Why I rejected it: For one thing,
it probably wouldn’t have been
funny. And for another thing, do I
want most of the senior class to
kick my ass?

Idea#3: Wedding update. Last

week my husband-elect Steve and ‘

I registered for our wedding gifts.
I’d write about how weird it was
that we were actually asking the
80-year-old woman in the purple
polyester suit that we work with
for advice on decorating ourhome.
And how we were tempted to do
weird things to confuse her, like
choose our silverware by the name
of the pattern. Or ask each other
questions like “Oh, so do you like
TV?” so she’d think we didn’t re-
ally know each other.

Why I rejected it: I’m pretty
sure that this would really only be
funny to me and Steve. Besides
that, I think the last woman at W&L
to go through this experience was
in 1988. And she was actually on
the exchange program from Mary
Baldwin and was engaged to a
JMU student. Well, that’s not true
either. But you get the idea.

Idea #4: Something Star Wars
related. Like, what professors are
most like various characters from
the movie. Or what your favorite
character says about you. Like, if
you like Yoda, you tend to say
vague things in class that really
don’t have any substance to them,
but make you sound wise. Also,
you might have strange interests
like swamp vegetation.

Why I rejected it: There’s prob-
ably something like that, only bet-
ter, out there on the Internet. And
not everyone would understand
why I choose Professor Hughes to
be Obiwan Kenobi.

Well, I suppose that’s all I have
for now. I have successfully filled
up some space (a challenge when
one gets more than 250 words
every other week) and have yet to
receive any threatening phone calls
from Jason. And I promise to find
an enemy over February break so
this doesn’t happen again.

Publications Board
disappointed in newspa-
persfconduct

To the editor:

I am writing this letter because I am
very disappointed in the material that has
been published in W&L’s newspapers the
past few weeks. It started with one poorly
written article in The Trident, and now the
two publications are hurling insults back
and forth. So, in an effort to stop the
bickering, I’m going to add my two cents.

The problems began with Holly
Thomsen’s article on The Ring-tum Phi’s
financial situation. I was irritated with
Thomsen because of the material mis-
statements she made about the Publica-
tions Board in her article. However, C.E.
Miller took it as a personal attack on the
Phi.

C.E. Miller then wrote a scathing col-
umn in the Phi that bashed The Trident for
bashing the Phi. Instead of offering cre-
ative criticism, she hurled remarks that

» could only hurt The Trident ,without back-

ing up her words with hard facts. Miller’s
column succeeded in giving the Phi staff
a pat on the back, but incited the biting
sarcasm of the infamous Glenn Miller in
the process.

Glenn Miller wrote a column that
wasway out-of-line. His column was more
of an attack than C.E. Miller’s column.
He called the Phi staff jealous. Jealous of
what? If they really wanted to be on The
Trident staff, they would at least have
approached the other paper about work-
ing for it. Then, Glenn Miller implied that

 

OPINION / ADVERTISEMENTS

Letters to The Ring-tum Phi

the stacks of Phi’s that used to stand
unclaimed for weeks illustrated the poor
quality of the Phi. He was wrong on that
one. It was not that no one wanted to read
the Phi—instead, it was that the papers
were not being delivered. In fact, the
stacks of Phi’s no longer exist because the
Phi has two business managers that now
deliver the papers.

However, I did have to laugh when
Glenn Miller insulted the Phi for “faulty
grammar and unintelligible sentences.”
These problems are big, but not as big as
the problems The Trident has with facts.

For example, I will point out the fact
errors Thomsen made in her article on the
Phi. First, the surplus in the Publications
Board account was not larger than usual at
the beginning of this school year as
Thomsen stated. We also cleared $10,000
the year before.

Thomsen then stated the salaries of
Publication Board members at an incor-
rect amount. A simple read of the current
Pub Board Constitution or consultation
with me would have pointed that out. In
gathering this information, Thomsen told
me she referred to a version of the Pub
Board Constitution that was at least two
years old.

Also, Thomsen was incorrect in saying
that if the Phi does not pay off its entire
loan to the Pub Board, the Pub Board
members will not be paid. The Pub Board
only needs part of the loan to be repaid so
the members will receive their salaries.
Also, the Phi does not have to pay back the
loan, especially if the funds are not avail-
able. If, and only if, the funds are avail-
able, the Pub Board will be reimbursed.

And here is a more recent fact error that.

appeared in a different article—did you
know that O.J. was found guilty in a civil
trial? Hmmm...

So, my message to the editors both
newspapers is this: stop the petty bicker-
ing and concentrate on what really
counts—thejournalism. Neither publica-
tion is perfect, and neither am I for that
matter. However, the insults do not ac-
complish anything except creating bad
feelings among the publications. Believe
it or not, no one outside your circles really
cares about the personal jeers.

W&L is a small university, and it has
two great newspapers. So take advantage
of it!!! Support each other—-or at least
ignore each other if you aren’t mature
enough to deal with the supposed rivalry.

rovum DEALER NOW!

before the end of the year.

As a writer for one of the papers, I
am writing on the behalf of several
writers for both papers I know first
hand about how each paper would like
the other to just disappear. But this
will never happen, and it probably
never will. Any good will that was
expressed between the two papers at
the beginning of the year has seem-
ingly vanished because of a few col-
umn inches. But, like any competing
newspapers in any market, it is time
that our two newspapers start to live
by some ethical guidelines and play
fair.

So, in light of the recent bickering
and childish behavior by BOTH pa-
pers, let’s try to agree on a few pro-
posals:

First, there are a number of very
talented people that work for both
papers, and, at the moment, that num-
ber is leaning toward The Trident. It
is a shame that on a campus as small
as ours, there are two newspapers that
are constantly bickering. Maybe the
campus needs to face it: we cannot
support two newspapers. Actually,
let me amend that. The campus can
support the two newspapers if they
can co—exist, publish on different days,
and stop trying to undermine the other.
It only makes both newspapers look

silly. Let’s have the talented writers \

for both papers rise above this petti-
ness and use their talents construc-
tively.

Second, I call upon the editors of
the papers to observe somejournalis-
tic ethics and refrain from printing

Finally, there are certain writers on»
both papers, namely columnists, that
people read religiously. I would also
like to challenge the many excellent-
writers that are on this campus to write.
for both The Ring-tum Phi and The;
Trident. Let’s weed out some of the

would expect so much more from af‘

both papers, and put the other two out}

Men’s basketball drops another overtime heartbreaker

Generals lose
third overtime
game of season

BY SCOTT BOOKWALTER
PHI SPORTS EDITOR

All good teams endure grow-

ODAC. W&L was routed by
Virginia Wesleyan, 88-62,
Wednesday night and then suc-
cumbed to Eastern Mennonite
in overtime, 97-94, Saturday
night.

dropped two more
games this week to
fall to 2-17 overall, 1-12 in the

 

lead into the locker
room.
The second half started as

badly as the first half ended for
the Generals. Virginia Wesleyan
stormed out of the break on a 19-
4 spree to take command of the
game at 54-32. The Generals
spent the remainder of the game
in an unsuccessful attempt to
reel in the Marlins and lost, 88-
62. The Generals did not help
their cause by committing 25
turnovers during the game and
being outrebounded 26-14 in the
second half.

“Our second half was ter-
rible,” freshman center Rich
Peterson said. “We played with
no confidence and just let Vir-
ginia Wesleyan take the game
away from us.”

Peterson did his best to sup-
port the Generals by scoring 15
points and pulling down eight
rebounds. Junior Kelly Dyer
added 11 points.

The Generals had beaten
Eastern Mennonite at home for
the past three years and looked
to keep the streak going Satur-
day in their final home game of
the season.

But the only streak that con-
tinued was W&L’s bad luck in
close games as Eastern Menno-
nite slid past the Generals, 97-
94, in overtime. The loss was
W&L’s third in the extra period
this year. . .

The Generals started slowly
once again as the Royals dashed
to an 11-point lead, but W&L
rallied to pullwithintwo at half-
time, 45-43. The Generals
scored the first three points of
the second half to pull into the
lead at 46-45, but they could not
sustain the momentum and soon
fell behind once again.

The Royals, however, could
not get the Generals out of their

rearview mirror once they re-
tookthe lead. W&Lhung tough,
and freshman guard Matt Jack-
son nailed a three-pointer with
1:02 left in regulation to tie the
score at 83-83. The game went
into overtime with the count re-
maining the same.

Freshman Scott Hudson
made a basket to begin over-
time, and the Generals looked to
finally assertthemselvesontheir
home turf and win for the first
time in the Warner Center since
a 79-78 defeat of Guilford back
on December 6. But once again
Eastern Mennonite regained the
momentum, and the Royals led
throughout most of overtime.

W&L was not about to fade
off quietly into the night, how-
ever. In a fashion similar to the
end of regulation, the Generals
rallied to tie the score late as
Peterson converted a three-point
play with 33 seconds left. The
game appeared destined for a
second overtime, but the Royals
had other ideas.

Eastern Mennonite inbounded
the ball, pushed it underneath the
basket and then flipped it back
out behind the are, where Mike
McElroy was waiting. McElroy
drilled the trey with only four
seconds left to drive the ﬁnal
dagger into the home team’s
hearts.

The Royals escaped Lexing-
ton and headed back to
Harrisonburgwiththe 97-94vic-
tory in hand, leaving the dis-
traught Generals searching for
answers.

" “It’s just really frustrating,”
Peterson said of the team’s luck
in tight games. “Hopefully, with
more experience in the future
we’ll be able to win those close

games.”

Peterson once again led W&L
with 19 points and 10 rebounds.
Hudson came up big with a ca-
reer-high 17 points and Dyer
amassed 15 points. Freshman
guard Mike Faber also hit a ca-
reer-high with 12 points while
Jackson scored 12 points to go
along with five assists.

This season has been a learn-
ing experience for the Generals,
and many of the players have
had to learn quickly. In a team
without a senior presence after
Chris Couzen’s retirement and
with only six juniors and sopho-
mores on the roster, W&L has
looked to the freshmen to shoul-
der a large part of the scoring
and rebounding load. No fresh-
man has done as well at that as
Peterson.

Although he admits he needs
to get even stronger to dominate
in the physical ODAC, the 6-
foot-6 Trumbull, Connecticut
native has more than held his
own on the floor. Peterson leads
the team with 13.9 points and
7.0 rebounds per game, but he is
not particularly impressed with
personal accomplishments.

“I’m happy to be a contribut-
ing part of the team,” he said,
“but I just wish we could find a
way to win some games.”

The Generals will next get a
chance to do that tonight at
Randolph-Macon, kicking off a
season-ending five-game road
trip.

Despite the team’s struggles
this year, Peterson believes the
young Generals can pick up the
pace before it is too late and
finish its long season on a posi-
tive note.

“We’re just trying to win as

many games as we can to try to
salvage the season,” he said.
“We still have a team goal of
making the conference tourna-
ment, and that isn't out of reach.

I thinkthat would really give the
team a boost, and even if we
didn’twin any games in thetour-
nament, it would give us more
confidence for next, year.”

Hypnoﬁst

BY Tom WADLOW
PHI ASSITANT News EDITOR

Last Wednesday, not everybody in the Lenfest Cen-
ter was conscious.

Hypnotist Tom Deluca, College Entertainer of the
Year, hypnotized students to pose, dance and do Kung
Fu while the audience rolled on the floor with laughter.

The show consisted of two parts. For the first half,
Deluca impressed everyone with card tricks and guess-
ing words torn out of The Ring-Tum Phi. The second
pan was pure unconscious comedy. Deluca asked for
20 volunteers, put on some soft music and talked to
them. A few finger-snaps later, all were “put under.”

Deluca had people checking their ﬂies whenever he
cleared his throat. He had people taking off their shoes
because they thought they were on the wrong feet. He
had them reverting to childhood and telling him their
favorite TV shows. He had Sophomore Mikel Parker
thinking he wasJackie Chan’sbrother and ﬂyingthrough
the air in impressive Kung Fu kicks.

“I remember saying ‘SnorkeIs,’” said “Jackie’s brother”
Mikel Parker. He says he doesn’t remember much else.

Washington and Lee tax records reveal that
Law School Dean Barry Sullivan is the top-
paid W&L employee, eaming$175,048 in the 1995 tax year.

His compensation is $21,646 more than his supervi-
sor, University President John W. Elrod.

Elrod, who has been employed with the University
since 1984, was Dean ofthe College until July 1, 1995.
When he became president, he received a 13.04% pay
increase, according to data contained in the documents.

The data appeared in the University’s recent [RS 990
Forms, which the IRS requires private institutions of
higher education to complete and make available for
public inspection.

Elrod is not concerned that one of his subordinates
earns more than he does and explained that there is not
as much demand for university presidents in the private
sector as there is for those who are well—versed in the
law. He said Sullivan “took a very large pay cut” to
come to Washington & Lee.

There is no reason why a president’s salary needs to
be the highest in a University,” said Elrod.

“University presidents’ salaries are competitively
determined by salaries in peer institutions. Law and
medical school deans and some senior faculty salaries
are often higher than the president’s salary in the same
institution because of market forces in the practice of
law and medicine in the private sector.”

forms reveal employees’ salaries

As students prepare to report their minimum wage
incomes to the IRS, Phi Reporter Aaron Foldenauer
investiages the salaries of W&L’s top-paid employees

listed on the 990,Academe magazine reported in 1995
that the average compensation of undergraduate fac-
ulty at W&L is $75,200.

Elrod said that there are no across-the-board salary

In addition to his salary, the president receives
benefits such a car and a house. According to Elrod, the
Board of Trustees determines the President’s salary,
but the President determines everyone else’s.

So Sullivan’s salary would have been determined by
former President John Wilson, who at the time was
earning more than Sullivan. Sullivan, an expert in
appellate law who has argued several» cases in the US
Supreme Court, has been with the organization since
1994.

As Dean of the Law School, Sullivan teaches two
classes a year and invests much energy into faculty
recruitment, fundraising, career placement, and admis-
sions for the 360-student law school.

Besides Sullican and Elrod, the list oftop saleries is

increases because the process is individualized. Pay
raises, not accounting for promotions, are generally in
the 5% neighborhood, he said.

In addition to the eight employees whose salaries
were disclosed on the 990 form, 164 other W&L
employees earned over $50,000 during tax year 1995,
the period beginning July 1,1995 and ending June 30,
1996.

Elrod believes one of the strengths of W&L is the
quality of its employees, and high saleries are required
to attract top professors and faculty.

“Putting your money into people is a very wise thing
to do,” he said. “W&L is fortunate enough to be well
enough off to pay very competitive salaries to the
faculty, staff, and administration. And that’s some-
thing that the university ought to be proud of.”

Last week, SARAH (Students
Against Rockbridge Area Hunger)
delivered the proﬁts of this year’s lip
synch contest to four local food pan-
tries. Thirty four hundred dollars was
raised for the purchase of seven tons
of food, making the 11th annual con-
test the most successful ever.

The United States Department of Ag-
riculture deﬁnes an “average meal” as 1.3
pounds. Thus, SARAH donated 11,278

- meals to the needy of Rockbridge County.

SARAH Advisor Jerry Darrell at-
tributes the success of the event to
SARAH committee members who
spent the past 12 months planning for
it: Richelle Rowe, Nicole Richard,
Dana Hood and Matt O’Brien.

Luckily for children at Central El-
ementary School, some Washington and
Lee University students never outgrew
finger-painting. Local kindergarten and
first graders begin their first art classes
this week, taught by four W&L students:
Brandon Ferguson, Kathryn Sheppard,
James Silberstein and Geoffrey Veale.

Why doesn’t the school have an art
program of its own? Rockbridge County
contracts art teachers from Fine Arts in
Rockbridge, due to the lack of funding
for an art program. However, FAIR only
provides programs for 2nd through 5th
graders. “We look for outside help for

kindergartn

out little ones,” Central Elementary
School Principal Harry Stone said. ‘‘I
was excited when I found out about the
W&L students.”

Senior art major James Silberstein
says that their work is essential. “I don’t
know how you teach kindergarten and
first graders without art,” Silberstein said.
“For many of them, art is the only way
they can express their thoughts and emo-
tions. Art is also critical in developing
their critical thinking and thought pro-
cesses.”

The students will teach art two times
a week for about an hour. “My goals are
to teach them art that will make them
think about what they’re doing and help
discover their individual creativity.”

.;;Fancy Dress dating guide for the hopeless romantics

Last week, I overheard two
freshman guys talking. One asked

 the other. “So, are you like, guar-
LL zinteed an FD date, or is it some-
"3 thing you really have to work on?”
 This amused me, and I probably

GreenLand
Betsy Green ’97

 should have offered it as Quote of

' the Week, but I decided instead to

steal it for use in my column. Any-
way, I think the answer to that
question is that you are pretty much
guaranteed a date for Fancy Dress.
Anyone can get a date iftheir stan-
dards are low enough —— I bet there
are tons of girls at Rockbridge
County High School who’d love to

go. But if you want a quality date,
a fun experience, you do actually
have to put some effort into your
FD date search. Luckily for you,
you have me to help. There are
several kinds of dates available
Follow my guide to find the one
that’s right for you.
Yourlioyfriend/Girlfriend. lf
you already have a steady boy-
friend or girlfriend, this may seem
to be the natural choice. You are
pretty much guaranteed not to be
rejected, you already know each
other pretty well, and will likely
have a good time. But first, do an
honest evaluation of your relation-
ship. is everything fine, or is there
trouble in paradise? If you broke
up three times last week or if you
just hooked up with his best friend,
cut your losses now and break up.

Fancy Dress is a long weekend of
uncomfortable clothes and social-
izing. it will not save your rela-
tionship.

Your high school are girl-
friend. High school girlfriends
are a common date choice for fresh-
man guys (atleastthose whodidn’t
already break up with their high
school girlfriends at Thanksgiv-
ing). This is a huge mistake. Most
high school girlfriends are pretty
uncomfortable with your drinking
— you’ve no doubt heard about it
already. When she sees the de-
bauchery of FD, she will freak out
and think you are Bailey from Party
of Five. If your relationship isn’t
over already, it will be when she
sees you at a Wednesday night hall
crawl. 'Or worse yet, she will rise
to the occasion and get blitzed on

Zima and you’ll spend the rest of
the weekend watching her get her
sixteen-year-old stomach pumped.

Imports: Cheese. Many W&L
guys will chose to import dates
from one of the Fine Neighboring
Women’s Colleges. There are
some very cool girls just a short
drive away, and you may well have
just as much fun with one of them
as with a W&L woman. Or not.
The key is to get to know this
woman on a deeper level than that
she seemed cute and funinthe dark
basement of your fraternity house.
If you don’t, you’ll end up spend-
ing a lot of time with absolutely
nothing to talk about, time that will
be increased by the fact that she
will probably be sleeping in your
room.

b) its target audience of women

7) An average episode of “Frasier”
contains more obscure intellectual

b) Singers in a greek chorus.

c) Dots on a Seraut painting.

(1) Elephants in Hannibal’s army.

8) “NYPD Blue” has:

a) More sex, viloence and naughty
language than a Kennedy family
reunion.

b) Answered the prayers of the one
person in America who actually
wanted to see Dennis Franz’s ass.
c) Succeeded in pissing off both
uptight, morality-pushing right

Editor’s note:
“Life on the Hill” will

return next week.

an FD cadet is one of the few
opportunities a W&L woman re-
ally has to actually ask a guy of her
choosing to Fancy Dress. VMI is
full of good looking guys who we
know are in good shape since we
see them running allthe time. And
a man in uniform is certainly ap-
pealing to a lot of women. All you
have to do is decide if a blue-eyed
or green—eyed Keydet would look
best with your dress But remem-
ber, the same advice about women
from other schools applies to ca-
dets, perhaps even more so—these
guys are armed.

Just Good Friends. Probably
the best way to go is to ask a good
friend of yours to go to FD with
you. You have fun hanging out
together anyway —— going to FD
together is the same thing only in

nicer clothes. But don’t take a
Friend Date for granted. Guys,
if you are thinking about that
cool girl who hangs out at the
house a lot, remembfer that some
of your friends might have the
same idea. You better get to
her first. And women, now is
the time to startdropping hints.
Go out, look cute, ad mention
to your buddies that you don’t
have a date yet. Then let nature
do her thing.

So you see, finding a Fancy
Dress date really isn’t that hard.
Go out, look good, smile and
have fun. And if that doesn’t
seem to be working, either
lower your standards or follow
my previous advice and start
hooking up like it’s going out
of style. See you at the ball!

Clinton presents
solution for public
school problems

There is so much truth in the
statement: “A mind is a terrible
thing to waste.” Undoubtedly, all
Washington and Lee students gave
credence to such a belief many
years ago; for ifthey had not, they

From the Left
Laura Knapp ’99

certainly would not be here.

President Bill Clinton has made
education his number one priority
for the next four years, “to ensure
that all Americans have the best
educationinthe world.” Although
his proposals have been charac-
terized as “ambitious” by Repub-
lican skeptics, President Clinton
deserves full support on any and
all measures that seek to improve
the quality of America’s public
schools and make American stu-
dents more competitive for the
21st century.

It is a fact that W&L students
hail from the best elementary edu-
cational systems in the nation. One
need only flip through the Fresh-
man Face book to observe the high
caliber of students that attend this
school. What is common in all
these high schools is quality staffs
and quality facilitieswhich,inturn,
produce quality students.

In his State of the Union ad-
dress, President Clinton proposed
a number of measures that would
make grossly under—funded, un-
der-staffed schools look like the
high schools from which many
Washington and Lee students
graduated.

One of Clinton’s most aspiring
proposals is in regard to making a
college education available to all
American citizens, through the use
of tax breaks and increases in stu-

Quote of the Week

“The co—op just isn’t a cool
place to hang out when
you’ve got the funk.”

dent loans. “We must make the
13th and 14th years of education,
at least two years of college, just
as universal in America by the
21st century as a high school edu-
cation is today. We must open the
doors of college to all Americans.”
There is a fundamental sense in
this goal.

A W&L student need only to
examine his own career at school.
Many high school graduates in
America today that do not even
consider college or any other form
ofhigher education because ofthe
mere fact that they do not posess
the means to pay for it. In an age
which a college education and in-
creasingly a graduate degree is
essential for success, it is sad that
these students who obviously
worked to their fullest potential in
high school cannot continue with
their studies.

If such a system of denying
students the opportunity to attend
college, what incentive is there
for them to work in high school?
Clinton’s proposal is aimed at giv-
ing these students that incentive.

President Clinton made the as-
tute observation that, “One of the
greatest source of our strength in
the Cold War was a bipartisan
foreign policy. Because our fu-
ture was at stake, politics stopped
at the water’s edge.

Now I ask you, and I ask all our
nation’s governors, I ask parents,
teachers and citizens all across
America, for a new non—partisan
commitment to education, because
education is a critical national se-
curity issue for our future and poli-
tics must stop at the school house.”
This certainly should not be a
Democrat versus Republican is-
sue. Partisanship does not a place
in a discussion about education.

ANSWERING THE ll|JESl|[lN

BY DAVID BALSLEY
PHI FEATURES EDITOR

The announcement that G. Love
& Special Sauce will appear at the
Fancy Dress concert has left at least
some students wondering, “G. who
and Special what?” Unlike the main
act of the evening, A-Tribe Called
Quest, G. Love and Special Sauce
has enjoyed renown only very
recently.

A Tribe Called Quest entered the
mainstream with their 1990 release
“People’s lnstinctive Travels and the
Paths of Rhythm,” whose “Can I Kick
It?” and “I Left My Wallet in El
Segundo” gained popularity. Tribe
did not achieve stardom, however,
until they released “The Low End
Theory” in 1991. “Check the Rime”
and “Scenario,” featured on the al-
bum, both achieved heavy air play
on MTV. Tribe has since enjoyed
success with their two most recent
albums.

In comparison, the popularity of
G. Love & Special Sauce has been
relatively short-lived.

According to the Sony web site
fo'r the group, G. Love (Garrett
Dutton), the band’s vocalist and gui-
tarist, developed an interest in the
guitar as a teenager. Under the in-

The group released its self-titled
debut album in March, 1994. Critics
acclaimed the album’s combination
of blues, “back-porch vocal
stylings,” and semi-acoustic accom-
paniment, which G. Love has termed
“ragmop.” Rolling Stone gave the
album four stars, calling it “the
damnedest thing to hit hip-hop in a
long time.”

Following the release of their al-
bum, G. Love and Special Sauce
began touring clubs and opening for
the Violent Femmes. The group then
played a ten-day tour in the UK,
where they also performed at the
Pink Pop Festival in Holland.

After touring Japan, the group
achieved widespread recognition
when they appeared as a main-stage
act for the 1995 H.O.R.D.E. festi-
val, along with Blues Traveler and
the Black Crows. '-

Building on their newfound suc-
cess, G. Love and Special Sauce has
recently produced their second al-
bum, “Coast to Coast Motel.” The
album has been described as a cross
between folk, blues, jazz, funk,
and rap.

G. Love and Special Sauce will
appear with A Tribe Called Quest on
March 20, at 9:00 p.m., in the

'Absolule Power’ shows
Easlwoods sense of 

$‘n’3r*:‘r 1/2
of 4 stars;
funny and
laid-back

The pitch: .
“lt’ll be like '-
‘The Addams
Family’ meets
‘Nixon.”’

BY ALEX CHRISTENSEN
Pm MOVIE CRITIC

Clint Eastwood is one ofthe great American directors. He
likes to get inside of material that is cliched, tired, overused,
orjust bad, and turn it into something solid and entertaining.‘
lt’s not an easy job, but he manages to do it time and time"
again. His “Firefox,” “Heartbreak Ridge,”and “White Hunter,
Black Heart” are all quiet wonders, taking absolutely absurd '
stories and applying such bravura filmmaking and under!’
stated hip self-consciousness that they murder all reasonable
expectations and go for something wholly original. M

“Absolute Power” resembles these films in that the story
is just plain silly. An aging jewel thief (I mean, come on).
named Luther Whitney is in the midst of robbing a large
estate in Washington when he hears someone coming. Hid-'
ing back in the vault where he wasjust grabbing the loot, he;
finds that he is sitting in front of a two-way mirror. On the:
other side, a man and a woman, both apparently drunk, first’
playfully ﬂirt and make out, then start to get rough with
each other. ,

What’s most amazing about this set-up is not that the:
situation is such absurd fun or any kind of building menace,f
but just Eastwood’s use of himself as an actor and an icon to?
subtly mock the whole enterprise. He keeps giving us little}
shots of Luther, the thief, with his hat pulled down over his;
eyes, the lower half of his face stoic or just slightly betrayingl
emotion. lt’s wonderful to watch, like a ballet all on once
man’s face, at the same time sending up every grunting lonei
cowboy Eastwood has ever portrayed, and that’s a lot.E
What’s great is that Eastwood can still use that image to its:
full effect, in “Unforgiven” or “Bridges of Madison County,”3
and then go back and make fun ofit here like he did in “White;
Hunter, Black Heart” and “Heartbreak Ridge.” Being able to
so successfully move back and forth between the image and‘
the self-parody is really quite a remarkable feat, and it can:
only be hoped that Eastwood can keep up the act. _

Anyway, back to the plot: the man who turns out to have’
been the drunk behind the in the bedroom scene turns out, as
you know from the trailers by now, to be the President ofthe:
United States, Alan Richmond (GeIreHackman). When the‘
girl is killed by his Secret Service agents,_a cover-up ensues,

which -Luther immediately involves ‘himself in foiling.

Judy Davis, as the Chiefof Staff, has way too much fun
with her role. Hackman is pretty stalwart and one-
dimensional except for one scene, which makes abso-
lutely no sense to advancing the plot, but is too much
fun to be resisted. Davis enters a party at the White
House wearing a significant necklace, and she and
Hackman do a hilarious dance sequence (to Eastwood’s
own Power Waltz) that brings up images of the best of
Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston from the Addams Fam-
ily films. The absurdity, the ooh-ing crowd, and Hack-
man and Davis’s expressions make it so over-the-top
that you can’t help loving it.

Almost the whole movie is like this. Chase scenes
are perfunctory and seem like they were worked out on
the set. They’re languorous and tense at the same time.-
Luther’s dysfunctional relationship with his daughter
(Laura Linney of “Primal Fear”) is almost played for laughs
as well. We have this sort of superhero thief who dances in
and out of any place he chooses, evading capture and detec-
tion, and then the contrast of trying to relate to his daughter,
whom he largely abandoned after his stints in jail. The
explanation for why they are able to reconcile is so ridiculous
that it’s better to leave it to the movie. It works there; it
wouldn’t work on paper.

Eastwood also keeps including these great shots that
have almost no connection to building the story. lt’s
like he’s saying, “As long as this shot is here, let’sjust
stick it in.” He’s having fun, and there’s nothing wrong
with that. For instance, when Luther first enters his
house, Eastwood shows us a lovely shot of all of the
porches down the block lining up with Luther’s, almost
like a mirror within a mirror. Later, Luther is shown
drawing a sketch of a house, which then fades into the
shot of the actual house. None of these fireworks are
necessary, but they add to this odd sort of dark, relaxed
enjoyment Eastwood creates throughout the film, like
nothing is serious but everything is at the same time.

One thing “Absolute Power” is not is taut. If you’re
looking for a no-brainer thrill ride, this ain’t it, but the
thrills are there and the movie never falters. Eastwood
hasn‘t lost a step as an actor or director.

VMI to learn from other co-ed military schools

BY C.E. MILLER
PHI STAFF WRITER

irginia Military institute is
learning from the
-Citadcl’s mistakes.

Several members of the VMI Co-
education Committee visited Norwich
Univcrsityin Vermontthislastweeks.
The trip allowed committee members
to observe first hand a working co-
educational system.

“We want to do it right,” Second
Class President Kevin Turillo said,
“The best way we can do that is to look
at other military co-educational
schools.”

Norwich is one of two schools that
is participating in a cadet exchange
program with VMl. The exchange

program will help VMl through its
transitional first year ofco-education.
The Citadel is looking to set up a
similar program after two of its four

female cadets withdrew
from the school.
“Visiting other
schools has shown the
necessity of upperclass
female cadets in the
corps,” Tornillo said.
Eight females and
four males will spend a
year at VMI as part of
the exchange program.
The students, from Nor-
wich and Texas A&M

University are familiar with military
co-education. The upperclass female

freshmen.

The exchange cadets will arrive
early in August to complete a full and

detailed orientation
of the VMI system.
They will not hold
leadership positions
not participate in the

PRESS RELEASE

Washington and Lee
University students are eli-
gible for up to $100,000 in
scholarship funds , through
Project Vote Smart’s Na-
tional Internship Program.
The funds, which are made
available through grants
from the Hearst Founda-
tion, have been released
by the Project’s founding
board, which includes
former senators Barry
Goldwater, George
McGovern, Mark Hatfield
and Bill Bradley, and other
prominent national lead-
ers.

“These scholarships en-
able Washington and Lee
students to work with in-
terns from colleges across
the country for a semester
or term, to improve the po-
litical climate for every-
one,” saidAnn Yoders, Na-
tional Internship Coordi-
nator. “Armed with the
computers of our Voter’s
Self-Defense System, our
interns fight political hype
every day, by requiring
candidates and elected of-
ficials to be accountable
for their campaign state-
ments and actions while in
office.”

Yoders said that students
from all fields of study are
encouraged to apply for
internships at Project Vote
Smart this year. Their work
at the Project-might focus
on researching hot current

issues, tracking campaign
finance donations, gath-
ering campaign issue po-
sitions or compiling vot-
ing records and perfor-
mance evaluations of can-
didates and elected offi-
cials at the federal and
state levels. Students
serve as researchers on the
Voter’s Research Hotline
(1-800-622-SMART),
and maintain and update
the Vote Smart Web site
(http://www.vote-
smart.org).

“We are very interested -

in diversifying our staff to
reflect information needs
and demands of the
American public,” said
Yoders. “We find it as-
tounding that young citi-
zens are labeled as apa-
thetic and uninterested in
government and politics.
Our interns are the most
idealistic, enthusiastic
group of people in the
country today, and they
constantly inspire the rest
of us to work harder in our
efforts to improve the po-
litical climate for every-
one.”

Project Vote Smart is a
national, non-partisan,
non-profit organization
that is funded entirely
through foundation grants
and the donations of over
50,000 members. Stu-
dents wantin g more infor-
mation about internship
and scholarship opportu-
nities should call Ann
Yoders at 541-754-2746

Letters to The Ring-tum Phi

SARAH commended by
Food Pantry

Dear Editor:

I want to thank Students Against
Rockbridge Area Hunger (SA-
RAH), Mr. Gerald Darrell, the stu-
dents of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, and all those who sup-
ported them, for their very gener-
ous donation to the Natural Bridge/
Glasgow Food Pantry. On Febru-
ary 12, SARAH donated over 4,000
pounds of food to our Food Pantry.
This food will help to feed hun-
dreds of needs people in our com-
munity.

I also want to express my appre-
ciation to those W&Lstudents who
helped transfer all the food to the
waiting trucks They helped move
over four tons of food.

Our Food Pantry serves over

100 families each month. More
than a quarter of the people are
children. One third are elderly
adultsliving on ﬁxed incomes. And
eighty percent of the households
we help are living in poverty. This
food means thousands of dollars in
assistance to these families.

Our Food Pantry is a coopera-
tive ministry of eleven area
churches. It is good to know that
we have groups like SARAH to
support us in our work. SARAH
and the students at Washington
and Lee University are to be com-
mended for their help in fighting
hunger and poverty in Rockbridge
County.

Sincerely,

Edward F. Rigg
Operations Director
Natural Bridge/
Glasgow Food Pantry

Ethnocentrism has no
place at W&L

Dear Editor:

In the spring of 1960, a group of
W&L students were in the locker
room following a track practice.
The conversation turned to the
coming football season and the
comment was made that one of the
schoolsontheschedulemighthave
some black players (Today we
would say African-American, but
that was an earlier time.) One
student put it crudely, “What will
we do if there’s black meat on
Wilson Field?”

The head football coach, Lee
McLaughlin, overheard what was
said and gave the answer: “You'll
act like gentlemen, that’s what
you’ll do.” It was clear what he
meant We would treat all visiting

players alike and none of them
would know there was anything
unusual going on. W&L was all
male and all white in 1960. The
New South was just beginning to
emerge, but the Old South and the
example of Robert E. Lee held us
to the standard of gentlemen.

All ofus can learn from the past.
Some ofus have more tolearn than
others. Unfortunately, there still
are individuals among us who re-
sort to bigotry and racial slurs.
Those of you who told an Asian-
American student this fall that he
doesn’t belong at Washington and
Lee are not gentlemen. It is you
who don’t belong here.

W&L strives to be a
meritocracy. There is no place
here for ethnocentrism.

"STOP!"

‘why?’

"IT'S TOO MUCH. YOU'RE GOING
TOO FAST.” '

“but that's how it is. that's the plan. it's
over like that I! before you know it."
“WHAT PLAN IS THIS?’’

"i don’t know. maybe there is one. it
seems just that no one has the key. it's
a giant puzzle and there's just too many
pieces."

“CHAOS?"

“but there is order...you could divide it
into parts. see? again — it's all compo-
nents—-and again. there is orderwhich
is natural in occurrence, order which is
followed, and that which is imposed."
“ORDER."

"AND THE ORDER AND THE CHAOS
ARE EXPLAINED HOW?"

‘We each have our own minds. it takes
years of make any sort of sense of it all. we
haveourownvoioes,opinions...somemay
believe in the Christian God. others be-
Iieve in the scientiﬁc view of cells and
growth and mutation. some people also
believe in otherworldly control. we are
animals but we have so many creations
through knowledge that our society is that
much more complex."

“|T'S OVERWHELMING PERHAPS?"
“for some certainly. but of course for
some it's easy."

“AND YET NO ONE REALLY HAS

“it could be different for each person."
“HAVE YOU FELT FOR YOUR KEY?"

» "yes;-.,it':s based on simplicity. following .. ._
,,natu,ral orders. quite possibly, it's put-_

ting your faith into you own philosophy.
but you realize, in any case, that there

is still a society you interact with unless
you become a hermit. like any other
species it is highly unlikely that you
could, or would, want to avoid other of
your own kind beyond a certain time
period."

“FAMILY, MATES, CONNECTIONS."
“rlght, your groundings. your earthly
ties."

“BUT THERE IS MORE?"

yes. you need to integrate your self.
spirituality, body, mind, sou|...these,
surely, you have heard of."

“A NEED FOR SURVlVALl"

“so it seems. but we have too many
desires now. people grow more and
more to hoard possessions. it is in the
cycles before. we always grow to glut-
tony."

“DO YOU BELIEVE IN LIMITS?"

"i believe shelter, food, clothing, love,
friendship, music, family, and opportu-
nity are things we all need, but not as
limits, ratherfoundations, which lead to
the limitless possibilities. the laughter,
the joy and glory found in being. we
don't need closets full of clothes and
wads of money.

“i believe in liming excess. i believe that
limiting yourself to what truly makes you
happy can lead to limitless possibilities
because of that happiness. if you allow
yourself to follow an almost neutral line
through society's web, then you can
escape the materialism, the politics and
the corruption."

"HOW CAN YOU BE NEUTRAL?"
"watch. observe life and create from
what you learn. we have parallel, per-
pendicular and tangent agreeances on
what we see, but it all comes to being
yourvision. your concept or thought or
theory.

"maybe it has nothing to do with neutral-
lty but rather acceptance and anticipa-
tion."

"ACCEPTANCE OF WHAT EX-
ACTLY?"

"differences that exist. to use the cliché;
both sides of the coin. in some cases
though more than one side exists."
‘YES, AND ACCEPTANCE IS EASIER
TO ACHIEVE THAN AGREEMENT ON
CERTAIN THOUGHTS OR DIFFER-
ENCES."

"something like that it seems."
“ANDYOU SPEAKOFANTICIPATION?"
"for when individuality is not curbed. per-
haps for small clusters of people with a
higher intent for living to found their
own."

"THEIR OWN WHAT?"

“creation."

Spike Lee talks about his career

BY ANNE ALVORD
PHI ExcuTIvE EDITOR

There was standing room only when
Director Spike Lee spoke in Lee Chapel
Wednesday night. The lineto enter ex-
tended from the chapel door, across the
front lawn, to the entrance of Payne Hall.

Lee, one of the most prominent and
influential ﬁlmmakers of our time with
such films as “ Malcom X,” “ Do the
Right Thing,” “ Mo’ Better Blues,” and
“She’s Gotta Have It” to his credit, dis-
cussed his experiences as a filmmaker,
his impressions of the place of black
ﬁlmmakers in particular, and race rela-
tions in America.

Lee never expected to become a film-
maker. As a child, he went to the movies
every weekend with his friends, but mov-
ies were “just fun, then you went home.”
He attended Moorehouse College in
Georgia, where he decided in his sopho-
more year to major in mass communica-
tions. When he graduated from
Moorehouse, he applied to the top three
ﬁlm schools in the country and choose to
attend New York University.

The three-year graduate program in-
cluded very little time in the classroom;
most time was spent making films, which
Lee says is the only way to learn to be a
ﬁlmmaker. In his third year at NYU, Lee
won the Student Academy Award.

After graduating from film school in
1982, Lee was hesitant to go to Holly-
wood with script in hand, because there

were very few African—American film-
makers at the time. His agent advised
him to “wait by the phone.” Eventually,
Lee gave up waiting and went indepen-
dent. During this time, Lee wrote “Mes-
senger,” which was never made because
of lack of funding. This time was key to
Lee’s career; he considered giving up
filmmaking and teaching cinema arts.
He realized that “Messenger” was too

ambitious for a young filmmaker such as
himselfand decided to make a less ambi-
tious film.

This film was “She’s Gotta Have It.”
It was shot in 12 days in July 1985. The
total cost of the film was $175,000 and
was funded day by day. When it was
released the next year, the ﬁlm made $8.5
million.

Today, Lee uses Hollywood for fi-
nancing and distribution. I

“Malcom X” had an original budget
of $33 million. Warner Brothers would
only fund $21 million of it, and another
$7 million was raised by the foreign
rights to the film. After several months
of filming, the money ran out, and the
project was shut down. Lee refused to
see his dream die and refused to compro-
mise on quality. He followed the ex-
ample of Malcom X himself, that blacks
need to rely on themselves in times of
trouble, and called on several prominent
black friends for financial help. The film
was eventually completed without com-
promising quality.

“He just e-mailed [us] out of the blue,” Knudson said.

Do you need a ride out of Lexington for spring

posting dozens of ﬂyers all over campus, post just one
where everyone can see it: on the web. Now under ‘‘In

a web-based message board and tell everybody you

need a ride.

down. The message automatically expires after the date

that you enter, but you can also easily delete the mes-

sage if you find what you need.

The idea came to Knudson after Kurt Riegel, former
Lexingtonian and son of a former W&L professor, sent
an e-mail to University Computing saying that he had
seen something similar. He thought it was something

couldn’t find anything that would be useful so he “just
wrote one.” Since his program was put on the web it has
never been without messages, Knudson said. In fact, it
has become so popular that a local ISP (Internet Service

Students wanting to talk to their friends over the

seemed to Lee to show he had come the
full circle. It was reminiscent of “She’s
Gotta Have It” in many ways. The film
was shot in 18 days. Columbia Pictures
wanted to fund the film, but because the
film was about Louis Fharkaran’s Mil-
lion Man March, Lee wanted to fund the
film with private money. The $2.4 million
cost of the ﬁlm was raised from 15 prominent
African—American men in entertainment,
sports and business. The ﬁlm was later sold
to Columbia pictures for $3.6 million.
Lee’s current projects include a film
for HBO which tells the story of four

 

young girls killed in the bombing of the
16th Street Baptist Church in Birming-

Geology students selected for consortium

BY ERICA PRossER
PHI STAFF WRITER

This summer Washington and Lee
University will host the Keck Consor-
tium, and two geology students will
have the privilege of attending.

The Keck Consortium, funded by the
W.M. Keck Foundation, provides re-

search opportunities for geology stu-

dents and sponsors three major activi-
ties: student-faculty research projects,
workshops and a spring symposium for
the presentation and discussion of find-
ings. Sophomores Erin Kraal and James
Sammons were chosen to participate in
this year’s program.

Kraal and Sammons will work with
students from 11 other institutions:

Amherst College, Beloit College,
Carleton College, Colorado College,
Franklin and Marshall College, Pomona
College, Smith College,Trinity Univer-
sity, Whitman College, Williams Col-
lege and College of Wooster.

“This program gives students an out-
standingopportunity to pursuetheirown
scientific research, one of the most im-
portant aspects of scientific training,”
said Cathryn Manduca, research associ-
ated at Carleton College which is the
headquarters for the consortium.

This summer’s consortium offers six
faculty-studentresearch projects for jun-
iors and two for sophomores. The topics
vary from geology of central Colorado
to studies of geologic features on Mars
and Venus.

“My research will focus on Mars,”
Kraal said. “I’m excited that I get to
pick an area that interests me and ex-
plore it this summer.”

The W.M. Keck Foundation, one
of the country’s largest educational
grant-making foundations, was es-
tablished in 1954 by the late Will-
iam M. Keck, founder of the Supe-
rior Oil Company.

The consortium has existed for 10
years with funding from the foundation
that now totals $4.4 million. The
foundation’s primary focus is award-
ing grants to colleges and universi-

"ties throughout the U.S., with par-

ticular emphaisis in the fields of
earth sciences, engineering and
medical research.

American voter simply wants two
things: an end to the scandal and
campaign ﬁnance reform.

The Democratic campaign
money scandal is a complex weave
of people, corporations and coun-
tries. What has really gone on?
Who is really at the center of the
matter? WJ1o.stands to win and

i lose? With all the speculation and

accusations, it is nearly impossible
to know. Hopefully I can try and
shed some light into the matter
over the next two weeks.

Before we start with this, we
need some background. After the
Republican victories in 1 994, Presi-
dent Clinton and the,Democratic
National Committee realized that
in order to get reelected, a massive
fund raising push must be made.
And as is the case with any politi-
cal fund raising effort, incentives
had to be found.

In early 1995 the DNC decided
to ask the president to make time
for major contributers to partici-
pate in social activities with the
president. In a return memo, Mr.
Clinton proposed that contributers
that paid $50,000 to $100,000 could
“sleepover” at the White House.
On the back of the memo, Mr.
Clinton wrote, “Ready to start over-
nights right away.” After that point,
Mr. Clinton was involved in mi-
cro-managing the fund—raising ef-
fort until the election.

Since January 1995, there were
103 coffees with contributors. And
in President Clinton’s first term,
938 guests stayed at the White
House. What effect has this had?
* White House official Evelyn
Lieberman wrote a memo to policy
advisers that issue briefings would
be “considerably truncated or
eliminated” so Clinton could ad-
here to his find raising schedule.
- In a dramatic policy turn-around,
Mr. Clinton was quoted as saying
that assault rifles were, “a tool that
Americans can use to fight crime.”
This came immediately after a cof-
fee with leaders of the} NRA.

What is legal and illegpl in this
whole mess? Well, ‘the Justice
Department has said that the Presi-
dent may host people at the White
House whether they have contrib-
uted money or not, and the presi-
dent and vice president may solicit
donations as long as they are not on
government property. What is il-
legal is soliciting contributions on
government property and having
federal employees solicit money
for a political party.

Mr. Clinton has repeatedly de-
nied that the coffees and “over-
nights” were used to solicit money,
and that nothing improper hap-
pened. Though since he said that,
many improper activities have sur-
faced.

Johnny Chung, a California
businessman, gave $50,000 to the
DNC and got invited with six Chi-
nese officials to watch the taping
of Mr. Clinton’s radio address in
March 1995. These officials were
the heads of Chinese state oil and
trading companies. Last week, it
surfaced that this check was pre-

sented to one of Hillary Clinton’s
aides inside the White House. An-
other Democratic fund-raiser,
Mark Middleton, solicited a $15
million contribution in 1995 from
Liu Taiying, chief financial officer
for Taiwan’s Kuomintang Party.
Possibly the most questionable
was the money that came from
John Huang. Huang was the vice
chairman of the Lippo Group, an

“White House
official Evelyn
Lieberman
wrote a memo to
policy advisers
that issue brief-
ings would be
‘considerably
truncated or
eliminated’. . . .

79

Indonesian Conglomerate with
strong ties to China. Huang even-
tually became a DNC fund-raiser.
Lippo’s high investment rate in
China makes an open trade policy
with the United States very valu-
able to their interests. Huang’s
fund raising activities have re-
ceived much attention since the
election.

The Washington Post accused
Huang recently of offering $45,000
to two associates if they would
accept $250,000 to donate to the
DNC. Though the two denied the
money, the Post speculated that
Huang might be involved in awider
money laundering scheme. Huang
also reportedly took money from

individual contributions and other
events, and reported them as
money raised at two dinnerswhich
Mr. Clinton attended. This raised
much speculation as to where the
money came from.

To the DNC’s defense, they
have returned $3 million in con-
tributions, almost half that was
raised by Huang. Their internal
investigation has not been con-
cluded yet. Senator Fred Thomp-
son is preparing his congressional
investigation, and Attorney Gen-
eral Janet Reno is still fending off
questions about a special council.

Though there is a tremendous
grey area surrounding Mr. Clinton
and the DNC, it is clear that even
though these actions may not be
illegal, they are clearly improper.
There is really nothing that can
come from this, since the election
is over, but what could possibly
happen is the tarnishing of some
distinguished political careers, like
that of Vice President Gore. The
Republicans need to tread lightly
and not try to make the investiga-
tions a Clinton-bashing party.
That strategy will backfire and
hurt the Republican party.

If a real Watergate-type of scan-
dal does come out of this, the
offenders need to be punished
quickly and severely. Money is
an integral part of politics, and if
someone shares the beliefs of a
candidate, they should be able to
help them get elected. However,
fund raising should never hurt the
implementation of policy, never
be done in foreign countries and
should never be done by federal
employees who should be con-

yet that’s what our university
has done. For the few students,
faculty, deans, and professors
who have never ventured into
the dungeon (also known as the
Gaines workout room) the facil-
ity stinks.

I hadn’t done much work-
out since freshman year, when I
was still intent on keeping off
the freshman 15. But I do re-
member being able to walk in
and pretty much find a cycle or
Nordictrac to burn calories on.
Since the sophomores were forc-
ibly moved into Gaines, use of
the facility seems to have tripled.
Duringpeak work out times such
as 3 p.m. one is hard pressed to
ﬁnd even the rowing machine
available for use.

When winter weather
drives the joggers inside, the dun-
geon begins to resemble a room
of torture.

When I decided to try and
lose that freshman 15 this year,
I discovered the dire straits of
the workout situation at our
school.

I realize this University has
a lack of space problem, but that
still does not excuse the other
problems with the workout room.
First there is the ventilation, or
lack thereof. The air is never
turned on, and the stale stench
of sweat hangs in the air for
hours. Often I walk into the dun-
geon at 7 a.m. only to breath in
the putrid air of last nights work-
outs.‘ ‘ ‘ « ‘

help circulation are not much
use. The standing fan is trapped
in-between the stair steppers,
and rarely cools but one person.
The thing that won’t let you stick
your fingers in the fan is miss-
ing. This is a serious safety haz-
ard—take note the death blades
will remove appendages. The
other is a floor fan, and often
keeps my ankles at a comfort-
able temperature. It boils down
to not much help at all. After

’The two fans available to,‘

room more like a
dungeon

leaving the sauna like dungeon,
the wintertemperatures are a
welcome relie. ’‘

Secondly the machines the
University has chosen to place in
the small area are out of date,
and worn out (this crap is falling ‘
apart) There is no easy way to
lower the seats on the cycles. I
have often made a fool of myself
tryingto pull the rusted peg from
hole number seven. This effort y
usually results in me falling
down, and the peg remaining in
its hole.

The stair steppers are of-
ten broken, with one step perma- V
nently stuck to the floor. Only it
is really hard to tell this until
you wander over and try to get
the old biddy going. Then you,
suffer morbid embarrassment
while the other users stare at
you (no one is ever nice enough to
let you know before hand that
the machine from hell is not;
working.)

Thirdly, there is no music.
So unless you bring your
Walkman and a supply of batter-
ies you end up listening to your
English professor grunt and
groan on the Nordictrack. The
weight room, although not in tip-
top shape, at least has a central,
sound system that effectively
blocks obscene workout sounds.

In an effort to help speed up
rotation on the aerobic machines
the powers that be have posted“
helpful signs. These signs po-
litely suggest limitingyour work-
out to 30 minutes when other
people are waiting. Nice, but not
very effective. ll

Finally there’s the carpet.
The thingis that it absorbs sweat,
and unfortunately this particu-
lar carpet has absorbed a lot of,
sweat.

This is not just a student
problem. I hope support for an
updated facility will come from
many different levels. This room‘
is used daily by professors, by
students, by faculty. If we all get
together and make a stand we
can force the University to spend,
some money than will benefit
everyone on this campus.

It is time more attention
and money is paid to the health
and well-being of this commu-1.
nity. The dungeon needs to be
remodeled, or at least updated
into something that would pass

Freshmen usually have a roman-
tic idea about what Fancy Dress is,
and now it’s coming. It is not
going to be like the sock hops you
went to in high school. No, this is
isn’t just a dance or even a prom.

“Before you
know it,
Cinderella is
really a
pumpkin, and
Prince Charming
is cleaning up
his fraternity
basement.”

l
This is a ball. Freshmen want to be
either Cinderella or Prince Charm-
ing. They try their hardest to make
Fancy Dress a romantic evening to
remember, from bringing their date
flowers, to threading sequins into
their hair, Guys: Do NOT try the

sequin thing. These romantic fresh-
men are bound and determined to
fall madly in love with their FD
date and to spend the comingspring
term basking in the sun at Goshen
with the new-found love of their
lives. Unfortunately, they have
forgotten that in what passes for a
dating scene at Washington and
Lee, this seldom happens. Before
you know it, Cinderella is really a
pumpkin, and Prince Charming is
cleaning up his fraternity basement.

By sophomore year, you’re still
pretty bitter about freshman year.
Sophomores are bound and deter-
mined to go to the ball with some-
one they are in no way romanti-
cally interested in. Sophomore
women will go with some guy who
asked them the Wednesday be-
fore, whose last name they aren’t
sure of. Sophomore men will get
fixed up with their best buddy’s
girlfriend’s hallmate’s cousin from
Hollins. Either gender of sopho-
mores will ditch their date and
spend the rest of the weekend
avoiding them to smoke cigarswith
their friends.

or girlfriend they go with. It’s a
safe, easy date. There are no ma-

have a solid time, but somehow
feel there is something missing.

Your senior year, you start

a fantastic time. At least, you
have understood the true spirit

it. The best way to approach
FD is to have no expectations
except for it to be a really good
time.

Liz Perkins, who portrays

ing the play, Crockett lists the prob-

provided by the German department.

Crockett also lists the difficulty
of learning lines in German as one of
the major challenges associated with
producing the play.

“I credit the students with being
able to do it,” Crockett said.

Perkins adds that the lines are
especially difficult to remember be-
cause they differ from standard Ger-
man: they are written in a Viennese
dialect, occasionally with vernacu-
lar, incorrect grammar.

has been working on the play since

SOUTHERN VIRGINIA COLLEGE
INCREASES RECRUITING EFFOFIIS

BY C. E. MILLER
PHI STAFF WRITER

Southern Virginia College is playing a member game.

The College is trying to increase enrollment by 200 percent.
Seventy-four students enrolled last September under broad
curriculum changes introduced by a new Board Trustees . In
January, the student body increased to 99 students.

“The first students really took a chance in coming here,” Vice
President of SVC Ralph J. Olmo said, “they are truly pioneers.”

If the college hopes to survive, it needs to steadily increase

For its third point of attack, SVC recently mailed information

American College Test and marked that they were LDS.

“It is too early to tell how effective these mailings were,”
Olmo said, but we hope to reach those students who don’t know

Lastly,thecollege has maintaineditsequine network. Before
the board, change, SVC was well-known for its excellent
horsemanship program. The school is commited to preserving
that image and hopes to attract students who are interested in its
equine program.

Although SVC has not yet received accreditation, it has
submitted its application to award degrees to the Virginia State
Education Authority.

“I am confident that we stand a good chance of approval,”
Olmo said.

The school has decided to enhance its areas ofcoiicentration
to include specialized subjects such as pre-law, business, and
pre-med to help students in preparation for graduate school.
Currently, the school’s liberal arts program center around the
great arts,astudy ofliterature from Plato to William Shakespeare.

Remembering
our idols

BY DAVID BALSLEY
PHI FEATURES EDITOR

The recent re-appearance of
Mark Hammill, who (as you prob-
ably know by now) portrays Luke
Skywalker in the “Star Wars” tril-
ogy, has lead me to wonder, “What
ever happened to all the other ac-
tors and performers I grew up
with?” So, I did a little investi-
gating. The following is a compi-
lation of some of the more inter-
esting results of my search:

John Ritter—— John Ritter, per-
haps best remembered as the only
male resident of the apartment in
the TV show “Three’s Company,”
can currently be seen in Billy Bob
Thornton’s “Swing Blade.” In the
movie, which has received na-
tional critical acclaim, Ritter por-
trays one of the few gay residents
of a small southern town. (Inter-
estingly, Ritter’s character in
“Three’s Company” was a hetero-
sexual man who had to pretend to
be gay in order to keep from being
expelled from his aprtment by his
landlord, Mr. Roper (Don Knots).)

Billy Idol —— Beloved by fans
in the 80’s, Idol rose to success
with songs such as “White Wed-
ding” and “Eyes Without A Face.”
His career in music, despite a few
comeback attempts, has since
dwindled. Idol has moved into
another arena of performance:
acting. He can be seen in Oliver
Stone’s “The Doors” as one of
Jim Morrison’s friends. Idol has
also recently appeared in the lead
role of The Who’s concert perfor-
mance of “Quadrophenia,” a rock
opera which traces the frustrations
ofa bellboy who becomes disillu-
sioned with his rock idols.

Gary Coleman Gary
Coleman, best known for wanting
to know what Willis is talking
about on “Diff’rent Strokes,”
nearly vanished during the late
1980’s and early ]990’s. In the
meantime, tabloid newspapers re-
ported every sort of outrageous
story concerning his activities.
Coleman has since resurfaced in a
900 number psychic hotline tele-
vision advertisement, appearing
alongside Dionne Warwick.

Hammill himself, after distanc-
ing himself as far as he could from
the role which made him famous,
gained a reputation for being a
second-class actor and struggled
to find parts in movies and plays.
However, his re-appearance has
proven an adage which children
ofthe 80’s everywhere have come
to regard as true: your pop culture
idols never really disappear. And
you probably thought you would
never see Gary Coleman again.

W&L Invitational

ERIKA WOODSON
PHI STAFF WRITER

This weekend marked the Wash-
ington and Lee lnvitational Lacrosse
Tournament. The tourney promised
exciting match-ups, presumably be-
tween the 11th (Cortland) and 9th-
ranked (W&L) teams in the country.
These match-ups never happened how-
ever, due to Greensboro’s upset of
Cortland in the opening round. Three
of the four games turned out to be
mismatched, but provided reasons to
cheer if you were Ande Jenkins, Tom
Fallace orjust a General in general.

W&L (#9) manhandled unranked
Shenandoah Saturday in the first game,
beginning at noon, to the tune of 26-2.
High scorers were junior Tom Fallace
with 6 goals, senior Shane McLaughlin
with 5 goals and 1 assist and senior
Ande Jenkins with 3 goals and 3 as-
sists. Twelve Generals scored on hap-
less Shenandoah, which failed to score
until the second half of the fourth
quarter.

Cortland (#11) and unranked
Greensboro then took the ﬁeld at 2:30
p.m. to play out what should have

been a repeat performance. Greens-
boro pulled the shocker of the tourna-
ment,however,upsettingCortland10-
9 and setting up the next days m‘s-
matched games in the championship
and consolation brackets.

Cortland met and conquered
Shenandoah Sunday’s noon game,
making amends forthe previous day’s
loss by posting 14 goals to their
opponent’s 5 to take third place in this
year’s tournament.

The championship game started
with a goal from Greensboro, but then
the Generals took control. The awe-
some W&L defense limited their op-
ponent from every possible angle as
the offense 5 .epped up their game as
well as their scoring records.

Jenkins reset his old scoring record
(set at Shenandoah the previous sea-
son) with 7 goals and 6 assists. Fallace
had another incredible day, netting 4
goals and 5 assists for a grand total of
15 points for the weekend’. When the
dust had cleared, W&L had triumphed
with another huge win--17-7.

The Generals have their next home
game the Saturday afternoon of FD
Weekend when they play Franklin &
Marshall at 2 p.m.

tennis community.”

Detwiler will oversee the daily
operations of the Duchossois Tennis
Center, a spectacular four-court in-
door facility that was recently com-
pleted and hosted its first competition

was donated by Richard Duchossois,
W&L Class of 1944, to honor former
W&L president Dr. John D. Wilson
and his wife Anne. The facility fea-
tures a dramatic gatehouse entrance
and a spacious spectator gallery that

runs the length of all four courts.

“Through the generosity of Mr.
Duchossois, W&L possesses an in-
door tennis facility that is second to
none,” said Walsh. “We’re proud to
open it to our faculty, staff and stu-
dents and equally proud that the build-
ing fits the architectural beauty of the
front campus.”

The building will open to faculty,
staffand students Mar. 17. Court time

native was also a nationally ranked
USTA junior player.

“I’m looking forward to the chal-
lenge of getting a new place started,
and I really like the college environ-
ment,” said Detwiler. “l’ve been to a
lot of indoor tennis facilities, and this
is one of the best l’ve seen.”

and Ericka Shapard lost only one
game between them.

Garcia, playing once again in
her customary #1 slot, ran her ca-
reer singles record to 53-11 by
destroying Hollins’ Ashley Ro-
nald, 6-0, 6-0.

Please submit a cover

could do as Shapard dispatched
her, 6-0, 6-1.

The W&L rout continued in
doubles play as Garcia and sopho-
more Mary Celeste Foster pounded
on Ronald and Morgan, 8-2, at the
#1 spot.

Evans Dining Hall was filled with the
strains of 50’s rock ‘n’ ".‘.II announcing
another Dining Service taenre Thursday
night.

“It was a great success,” Director of
DiningServices Gerald Darrellsaid about
the 50’s dinner theme. He said that he
was not surethe students would knowthe
songs, but after watching l're diners on
Thursday, the younger generation is in-
deed familiar with “old-tzme. rock ‘n’
roll.”

Dining hall dinner themes are a regu-
lar sight at W&L. Darrell said that the
staff tries to do several different themes
each year, usually about one “big event”
per month. Wok Night, though still tech-
nically a theme, “isn’t anything special
anymore,” but it remains regular none-
theless. He said that the themes rely a lot
on student input, since the purpose of the
themes is partially to break the monotony
that sets in after a while.

Other colleges and universities have
themes, he continued. The National As-
sociation of College and University Food
Services holds menu competitions for
the dinner themes created by participat-
ing schools like this one, and W&L has
often brought home awards from the
competition. __

Darrell pointed out the “front wall by
the double doors” just outside the main
dining hall where W&L’s dining service
ribbons hang. As an example of the
honors this staff has earned, he men-
tioned a second place last year and two
first place finishes before that in the
national competition.

The preparation behind the themes is
extensive. Darrellsaidthattlre plan-
ning begins every summer when the

Students seem to welcome the theme

German director to address
theater ‘structural differences’ Swimmer Places

FROM PHI STAFF REPORTS

The Washington and Lee University departments of
German and Russian and the Theater Department will
sponsor the visit of German theater director Rainer
Lewandowski from March 23-25. The visit is part ofa
two-week American speaking tour organized by West Vir-
ginia University, which also includes the University of
Pittsburgh, Carnegie—Mcllon University, as well as W&L.

Mr. Lewandowski is the director ofa famous theater
in the Bavarian city ofBamberg. In commemoration of
the Romantic composer and writer E. T. A. Hoffmann’s
220th birthday in 1996, Mr. Lewandowski published a
study about Hoffmann’s years in Bamberg, wrote and
staged an original play containing familiar characters
from Hoffmann’s Fantastic Tales, and adapted several
Hoffmann stories for the stage. The Bamberg Theater
also produced Hoffmann’s musical masterpiece, the
opera Undine.

Most recently, the Theatertraveled to Kiev, Ukraine,
to present its stage production of Hoffmann’s Made-
moiselle de Seuderi. In the U.S.A., Hoffmann is per-
haps best known as the author of the story on which
Tchaikovsky based his ballet, “Tire Nutcracker.”

Mr. Lewandowski is also an accomplished drama-

tist. His play, Today Neither Hamlet, has been suc-
cessfully produced by different theaters throughout
Germany and was recently translated into English. He
may work with it in one of his appearances at W&L
later this month.

On Monday, March 24, at 8:00 p.m., Mr.
Lewandowski will speak in Room 221 ofthe Commerce
School about structural differences between the theater in
Germany and in the United States, and about his own work
as artistic director of the E. T. A. Hoffmanrr Tlreatcr.

OnTuesday, March 25,11! 8:00 p.m., Mr. I.ew'.rndo\vski
will again speak in Room 221 ofthe Commerce School.
I-lis topic will be: “How Artistic Imaginatiorr Came to
Console Hoffmann: The Imaginative Realist E. T. A.
Hoffmann and his Relationship with the Romantic Move-
nrcnt in Germany.” Both presentations are open to the
public and free of charge. _

Presidents Gingrich and Thurmond?

The Democrats’ fund raising scandal supplies some interesting winners.

The story thus far:

The Democratic National Com-
mittee engaged in questionable, and
possibly illegal, fund raising ac-
tivities. President Clinton and Vice
President Gore were also heavily

engaged in these activities. The
Justice Department is trying to find
the line between what is legal and
illegal, since many “soft-money”
contributions are legal.

Is this the 90’s equivalent of
Watergate? An illegal act may
have been performed, with full
presidential knowledge, to secure
re—election. There are many politi-
cal games to be played, so who are
the potential winners and losers in
this scandal?

The Losers: 1. Vice President
Gore. Though Clinton participated
in questionable activities, it is

‘ highly unlikely he would be im-
3 peached — his popularity rating
1 have barely felt this scandal. Gore,
- on the other hand, stands to lose
 everything. He is potentially the
Itop presidential front-runner for
 the 2000 election. Currently, most
2 people in the country see him as
3 boring and clean. It might turnout
 that he is simply boring. His easy
I nomination could become a seri-

ous race.
2. The Media. An ad-industry

 research firm, Competitive Media
' Reporting, said the top 75 media
' markets made $400 million from
; political ads in the 1996 campaign.

U.S. News and World Report re-
ported that television stations in
Raleigh, N.C., made $8.5 million,

and one station received more
money from politicians than from
all the Ford and Chevrolet dealers
combined.

3. President Clinton. He could
lose but not for the reasons you
may think. His defense in the
Paula Jones case before the Su-
preme Court is that he was too
busy with his duties as President to
handle a civil case. But if Clinton
was cuttingback on his policy brief-
ings to raise money, what does that
say to the Supreme Court, which
has not ruled on the case yet.
Clinton may not be able to with-
stand the firestorm that could sur-
round that case.

4. The DNC. Though the Re-
publican Party is by no means clean
on this subject, the DNC is at the
center of this scandal. The nation-
wide popularity could take a hit
heading into the 1998 and 2000
elections. The Democrats could
lose the congressional seats they
gained in the 1996 election.

The Winners: 1. Senator Fred
Thompson. He is spearheading
the bipartisan commission to study
this scandal. If he can play the role
of the responsible crusader, he can
win wide publicsupport that could
translate into a Republican nomi-
nation for president in 2000.
Thompson stands to gain the most
from this. He has been bucking the
Republican leadership so his in-
vestigation can be truly bipartisan.
He is already seen as the “good
guy,” the popularity is his to lose.

2. The Republican Party. If the
Republicans can keep these inves-
tigations from becoming a media
circus, they could win the popular-
ity the Democrats stand to lose. It
is imperative that the Republicans
have a goal in these investigations,
and do not draw them out if there

is no wrongdoing.

3. Senator Strom Thurmond,
Secretary of the Treasury Ronald
Rubin and Secretary of Defense
William Cohen. Last week, Wil-
liam Safire outlined a humorous
scenario in his column in The New
York Times. Should Clinton be
impeached, it is possible that Gore
would follow. The. presidency

“There are
powecful people
in this country
who want to
see their man
elected, so
where is the
justice in
saying they
cannot do so?”

would fall into Speaker of the
House Newt Gingrich’s lap. It is
conceivable that he would not stand
above the fray on several issues.

This drops the presidency on
Senator Strom Thurmond of South
Carolina, President pro tempore
of the Senate. Since his age and
health would certainly be a serious
problem, he would possibly pass
the presidency on to our first
woman president, Secretary of
State Madeline Albright. Albright
is not a native citizen, so she is
automatically ineligible for the
presidency.

This passes the office to Secre-
tary of the Treasury Ronald Rubin.

He is also involved in several shady
dealings, and if he could not with-
stand the investigations, Clinton’s
Republican choice for Secretary
ofDefense William Cohen, would
be president.

Of course this scenario is silly,
but as with silly things in politics,
it seems far too likely also. Will
campaign finance reform really
happen? Probably not, or at least,
not the kind we want. There are
simply too many legal issues, spe-
cial interest groups and constitu-
tional issues to make campaign
finance reform an easy subject.

Why do we need campaign fi-
nance reform? We simply have
the workings ofa democracy learly
upon us. There are powerful people
who wantto seetheir man elected,
so where is the justice in saying
they cannot spend their money to
do so? No matter what happens,
political campaigns will live offof
money, and the wealthy and pow-
erful will continue to hold a lot of
power in politics.

The Supreme Court ruled on
this issue in the complex case
Buckley v. Valeo (1976) One of
the Court’s rulings was that people
could spend their money on poli-
tics however they want, and the
government can not restrict
someone’s spending. The Court
was deeply divided, but a prece-
dent was set: Any such law passed
by Congress might not hold up
underjudicial scrutiny.

Which brings us to the ultimate
losers in any scenario, the people.
If reform is not passed, we may
continue to have inﬂuence bought
by special interest groups, but if
the reform is passed, a liberty to
spend one’s money how they wish
will be eliminated.

Nobody said politics is fair.

Former W&L student tried for forgery

She could have been a typical
Washington and Lee University
student, blond hair, blue eyes,
medium height. A nice girl from
Florida. She got good grades, and
was slated to become a dorm coun-
selor this year. Then on/lugust 29,
1996 the police arrested her for

forgery.

Life on the Hill
C. E. Miller ’98

Jennifer Murphy’s story is bi-
zarre. Her actions are in direct vio-
lation of what everyone knew about
her. She had several good friends
and a steady boyfriend. Not only
was she well liked by the faculty,
but after an intensive interview
and application process, she was
chosen to be a dorm counselor.
She was chosen to represent the
ideal W&L student, to be a model
for the class of 2000. No one ex-
pected her to lie, cheat or steal, and
yet she did.

She fooled her roommates, her
boyfriend and her professors. Dean
Dennis Manning, a man who is

disappointed, but never surprised,
was shocked at her arrest. So many
people who trusted the W&L stu-
dent body were shocked to dis-
cover a student had been arrested
for forgery, and the checks she

passed in the guise of the W&L

  “Murphy

, claimed not to
 knowanything
about it, when

in reality the

checks were in
her possession.”

honor system were no good.

Her story begins with a missing
book of checks. Murphy’s room-
mate asked her if she knew any-
thing about it. Murphy claimed not
to know anything about it, when in
riaality the checks were in her pos-
sfssion. School ended and her

r ommates left for the summer.
Rometime later, Murphy decided

to use the book of checks to pur-
chase items such as a stereo.

She was again confronted by
her roommate. This time she ad-
mitted towritingone ofthe checks,
when she had written several oth-
ers. When word of Murphy’s ar-
rest got out the rumors began to
fly: “I always thought there was
something strange about her,” or
“She was fake, you couldjust tell.”
Eventually the rumors died down
and people forgot about her, for
better gossip, better stories. But
for Murphy, the ordeal was just
beginning.

Forgery is a felony in Virginia,
mandating time injail. Last Mon-
day morning, Murphy faced Judge
George E. Honts ill on four counts
of forgery and four counts of ‘“ut-
tering” which is signing someone
else’s name to a presented check.

Her lawyer had served sub-
poenas to several character
witnesses including Manning.
He had A become well
acquatinted with Murphy her
freshman year. This was his
first time in court and his first
time testifying. He told the
court that Murphy had been an

exceptional student and forg-
ing these checks was an
anomaly.

The Commonwealth’s attor-
ney, Gordon Saunders, felt
Murphy should face the felony
charges and take the punish-
ment for her crime. Having
prosecuted other cases, he felt
that Murphy was no exception
to facing the felony charges.

So here she is in a tight spot.
Time in jail at 20 years of age,
all for stealing a few checks
and buying some toys. Poor
judgment. Would Honts let her
off with a slap on the wrist like
Kurt Richter, or would she face
years in jail?

And so Murphy '5 bizarre story
comes to an end. Judge Honts re-
duced her felony charges to eight
misdemeanors and suspended her
two years in jail for 24 months of
unsupervised probation. Unless
Murphy violates her parole by
breaking the law, she’ll have
managed to violate not only the
Honor System without reper-
cussion but also a felony
charge. on her permanent
record.

I hurt anyone’s feelings. That atti-

every other part of campus are
picture perfect. In fact, almost too
perfect. W&L last week looked
exactly like a college brochure.
Remember all those brochures
you got after you took the SAT’s?
At first, I was really excited to get
them. Those colleges saw my test
scores, and they wanted me. ME!
Clearly, I was something special.
I eagerly filled out the reply card in
the back of each one, just to let
them know I was interested, not to

found out that all of my friends
were getting the exact same bro-
chure in equal quantities.

It was around that time that I
decided to be creative with all of
those useless brochures. I’d make
collages, or use pictures from bro-
chures for mix tapes The Iowa
State brochure had lots of pretty
trees, I remember, and the Univer-
sity of Chicago brochure had way
cool gargoyle pictures.

Other colleges, inexplicably,
took a shine to me. Ifl didn’t get
something from Sarah Lawrence

worried aboutthem. Cometothink
of it, the Victoria’s Secret catalog
is now stalking me with a similar
fervor. Coincidence? I think not.

All ofthose brochures had com-
mon elements, most of which I
could see on campus last week:
happy students rcadingundertrees,
dedicated professors teaching out-

think in every single brochure of
every college in the United States,
there is a picture of ethnically di-
verse students, one wearing a

school on it, one leaning on a bike,
all wearing backpacks, standing
under a tree.

I’m pretty sure I spotted that

MARCH 1 7, W1  

BY DAVID BALSLEY
PHI FEATURES EDITOR

It may seem strange to some
that a married woman would be

I attracted to the monastic life.

For Kathleen Norris, however,
living as a monk was only one
step in herjourney back to faith.

Norris, essayist and poet, has
made her re-discovery of Chris-
tianity the topic of her most re-
cent works. She will be here on
Tuesday for a Glasgow
Reading.

Norris’ spiritual journey be-
gan when she and her husband,
poet David Dwyer, moved to
Lemmon, South Dakota, accord-
ing to a July 1994 article pub-
lished in “The Christian Cen-
tury.” While living in Norris’
late grandmother’s home, the
two came to appreciate the si-
lence and vast expanses of west-
ern Dakota.

For Norris, returning to her
grandmother’s home also meant
examining her faith. Memories
of her religious upbringing re-
emerged. Confronted with her
past, Norris was forced to admit
that she was largely ignorant of
the faith which she had rejected.
She began to attend church and,
with the help of some minister
friends, started to see Christian-
ity as “a communal thing.”

Norris also became an asso-
ciate member at a monastery.
She took part in the monks’ prac-
tice of sustaining long periods
of silence broken only by scrip-
ture readings and prayer. This
deprivation, she found, allowed
her to confront sin, as well as
strike a balance between disci-
pline and freedom.

These initial experiences
comprise Norris’s “Dakota: A
Spiritual Geography,” :1 collec-
tion of long essays interspersed
with short, lyrical pieces, pub-
lished in 1993. A July 1996
article published in “The Chris-
tian Century” describes “Da-
kota” as Norris’ tale of her cs-
cape from the harried life of
New York and the rekindling of
faith which accompanied her
move to South Dakota. The
book became a best-seller.

Norris’s “Little Girls in
Church,” a collection of poetry,
followed in 1995. Her most
recent work ofprose, “The Clois-
ter Walk,” was published in
1996. In the latter, Norris de-
scribes her liturgical life at Saint
John’s Abbey in Minnesota, her
visits to other monastic houses,
and the various communities in
which she has lived, according
to a May 1996 article published
in “Commonweal.”

Norris has won critical ac-
claim for her works. She can

“bring alive the old desert fa-
thers and mothers, the saints of
the calendar, the idiosyncracies
of community life, the travails
of small-town living, the joys
and pains of marriage and old
age,” according to a
“Commonweal” May 1996 ar-
ticle.

Professor W. Lad Sessions,
Professor of Philosophy, also
praises Norris’s ability. Based
on his reading of“Dakota,” Ses-
sions characterizes Norris as “a
very poeticwriter”wlIoemploys
“awono'erfully spare use oflan-
guage.” According to Sessions,
Norris has the ability to look
beyond surface matters.

“Thereisadepthtothisworld
whichsheappreciates,”Sessions
said.

Sessionsencouragesstudents
to attend her appearance.

“l"durgcanyonethatlcould
to come and just listen to the
sound of her language,” Ses-
sions said. “[Norris is] a
woman who has taken a path
which many Americans do
not: a path to the spiritual,
and not just to the flashy,
materialistic world.”

Kat/Ileen Norris will appear
on Tuesday, March 18, at-1:30

Vladimir Sharov scheduled to speak

Vladimir Sharov, visiting Russian novelist, will make
two presentations at Washington and Lee University. In
the first, scheduled for March 19 at 7:00 in Room 221 of
the Williams School, he will read from his work and
speak on"“Russia,’_ the Bible’ and the Jews.”' 'Sh'arov’s

second lecture, “From” Under the R',Iibble:'():nei Writer’s I
Journey,” will be held a week later, on March 26, at 7:00

in the same location.

The first two novels of Vladimir Sharov were initially
banned by the Soviet government but finally came into
print six years ago. “Treading in the Tracks” was pub-
lished in 1991, and “Rehearsals” in 1992. Then “Before
and During” appeared in 1993, and “And Should I Not
Pity,” in 1995. All four were nominated for the presti-
gious Booker Russian Novel Prize for best novel in the
years of their publication.

Sharov has resided in Moscow since his birth there in
1952, but has spent the last half year here in Lexington,
where he hasjust finished a new novel entitled “An Old
Girl.”

The plots of his novels are very complex. On the
simplest level, “Treading in the Tracks” mirrors the
history of modern Russia through the history of a family
originating with a step-brotherof Jesus Christ. “Rehears-

_ the .To\ver.0f.l3al)el and the biblical Deluge. _This last.
novel has provokeda great deal of heated debate. Com-

wrote, “This eternal masquerade of history, a vaudeville

als” portrays recent Russian history through the story of
exiled Siberian actors attempting to perform the Passion
ofChrist in order to bring the Second Advent. The action
of“BefOreandDuring”beginswiththe people inhabiting
the “Department of Senile Sclerosis” of the Gcnushkin
Hospital, and unfolds their destinies as a Inad history of
twentieth-century’ Russia, while drawing parallels with

menting on this, the literary critic, M. Nekhoroshev,

with much dressing-up, which more often than not turns
into a tragedy, represents the subject ofSharov’s novels.
With Sharov, historical, philosophical, and theological
problems are woven into the lively narrative....Sharov’s
novel precisely hits the sore place of present-day soci-
ety.”

Both ofSharov’s lectures are open to the public. The
first is sponsored by the Weinstein Fund for Jewish
Studies and the second by the Russian Studies Program
of Washington and Lee University.

Vladimir Sharov will appear Wednesday to
read from his work. Sharov will present a
second lecture, “From Under the Rubble: One
Writer’s Journey,” one week later.

De—mystifying Saint Patrick’s Day

BY ANDREA EWING
PHI FEATURES EDITOR

Would you like to kiss my
Blarney stone?

Happy St. Patrick’s Day. If
you don’t wear green on Mon-
day,prepare to be pinched. March
17 is the day that we all become
Irish forjust 24 hours. Or at least
you claim to be so you can drink
more beer.

But why do we do things like
put green food coloring in milk
or wear pins that say “Kiss me
I’m Irish?” And what about the
fact that every city in the country
has a St. Patrick’s Day parade
even if the community has no

Irish heritage?

What is the purpose?

St. Patrick’s Day is an Irish
holiday honoring St. Patrick, the
patron saint oflreland. Although
not actually Irish (St. Patrick was
born in either Roman Britain or
Scotland in 385 A.D.), he is be-

- lieved to be responsible for con-

verting the Irish people to Chris-
tianity.

3 St. Patrick’s real name was
Maewyn Succat. He took the
name Patrick when he became a
priest. At 16, St. Patrick was
kidnapped by pirates and sold
into slavery in Ireland. During
six years working as a shepherd,
Patrick began to have religious
visions and took strength from

his faith. He escaped to France
after a vision told him where he
could find a getaway ship. There
he became a priest and later a
bishop. Whileincaptivity,Patrick
became driven bytheideaofcon-
verting Ireland to Christianity.
Sent as a missionary to Ireland
by Pope Celestine 1, Patrick
founded over 300 churches and
converted over 120,000 people.
Legend has it that he used the
shamrock, which resembles a
three-leaf clover, as a metaphor
to explaintheconceptoftheTrin-
ity. He used it in his sermons to
represent how the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit could all exist
as separate elements ofthe same
entity.Anotherlegend associated

with St. Patrick states that he gave
asermon fromahilltopwhich drove
all the snakes in Ireland into the sea
where they drowned. The snake is
a pagan symbol and this legend
may allude to the fact that he drove
paganism out of Ireland. A third
tale includes the belief that Patrick
raised people from the dead.

Patrick preached in Ireland
until his death on March 17, 461
AD.

Originally a Catholic holiday,
St.Patrick’sDayhasevolvedinto
a more secular celebration. Fol-
lowers of St. Patrick adopted the
custom of wearing a shamrock
on his feast day.

The first celebration of St.
Patrick’s Day in the New World

occurred in Boston in 1737. Over
100 cities now hold St. Patrick’s
Day celebrations, the largest in
New York City.

St.Patty’s Day has become an
excuse to wear green and party!
On this day “everybody is Irish!”

Green is associated with St.
Patrick’s Day because it is the
color of spring, Ireland, and the
shamrock. Leprechau ns are also
associated with St.Patrick’s Day,
but it is difficult to understand
why. The leprechaunsoflegends
are actually nasty little critters.

Perhaps St. Patrick’s Day is
only another excuseto go out and
have a beer or wear some really
tacky green outfit, but hey why
not do it— everyone else does.

It’s hard to separate a movie from the hype surrounding
it. I had been waiting to see “The English Patient” for a long
time before it came out. “Truly, Madly, Deeply,” by director
Anthony Minghella is a great little film that has had a great
deal of favorable attention on video (if you thought “Ghost”
was great, “Truly, Madly, Deeply” will blow you out of the
water). Ralph Fiennes has had a singularly meteoric rise
since “Schindler’s List” and through one of last year’s best
films, “Strange Days.” Kristin Scott Thomas owned “Four
Weddings and a Funeral.” And Juliette Binoche took us
through real heartbreak in Kieslowski’s “Blue.” Further-
more, critics and others described the film in glowing terms,
as a magnificent love story with the scope and fire of
“Casablanca” and “Lawrence of Arabia.” Now it’s going to
win Best Picture at the Academy Awards.

Can any film live up to that hype? Probably not. “Secrets
& Lies” does this year, as does “Fargo.” “The English
Patient” does not. In fact, it didn’t even crack my top twenty
for the year. I’d like to take this opportunity to list films that
were better than “The English Patient”just this year. Hope-
fully, somebody out there might seek them out on video and
see what the Academy overlooked this year. In addition to
the aforementioned “Secrets & Lies” and “Fargo,” “Big
Night,” “Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood
Hills,” “Sling Blade,” “Beautiful Thing,” “Jerry Maguire,”
“Heavy,” “Dead Man,” “Set It Off,” “Kids in the Hall Brain
Candy,” “Get on the Bus,” “The People vs. Larry Flynt,’’
“Evita,” “William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet,” “The
Cable Guy,” “Flirting with Disaster,” “Stealing Beauty,”
“Heaven’s Prisoners,” “Twister,” “Lone Star,” “Antonia’s
Line,” “Emma,” “Swingers,” and “The Young Poisoner’s
Handbook” are all better, more complete films than “The
English Patient.”

The problem, it seems to me, is that the Academy is
obsessed with finding a film with huge scope. Instead of

-looking forwhat’-s the bestfil-m (and-,-adm-ittedly, they’ve .

done better than they have in previous years this time), they
want an “event.” And “The English Patient” has all the
elements of a critics’ darling event film. Love, war, sex,
death, loyalty, betrayal, hopeless loss, and blah, blah, blah.

Some people have recently criticized the film, as they
criticized “Ghosts of Mississippi” earlier in the year, for
having an improper political focus. That’s a valid criticism,
but I still feel that if a film works, this kind of pernicious
fictional/historical revisionism is a secondary issue. Cer-
tainly, “Ghosts of Mississippi” fell down on these grounds,
but it wasn’t ruined. Neither is “The English Patient.”

What ruins “The English Patient,” or keeps it from as-
cending to the four-star range, is that the main love story is
so bloodless and boring that almost everything else in the
movie transcends it. The sweep and scope of the film keep
bumping up against this huge barrier to enjoying the film.
Kristin Scott Thomas looks uncomfortable through most of
the film. Her usual ability to bring deep undercurrents of
emotion to the screen, best exemplified by her telling Hugh
Grant she loves him in “Four Weddings,” is completely
missing here. There’s no chemistry with Ralph Fiennes.
And Fiennes himself seems to be sleepwalking. Whoever
thought he deserved a Best Actor nomination for this oddly
detached loser character was probably wacky on thcjunk. If
this were his first film, he would have gotten no recognition
for it whatsoever. Not that it would have killed his career;
he’s been brilliant and will be again. But it’s really nothing
spectacular. Forget the fact that his character, Laszlo dc
Almasy, was really a Nazi sympathizer who ruined lives and
betrayed his friends—Fiennes can’t even make him fall in
love. And that’s what’s necessary.

That said, the film is absolutely gorgeous. The desert and the
geography ofthe human body coincide provocatively. War and
the people involved in it are intertwined in a profound way. And
theunderlyinglovestory, between nurse Hana(Juliette Binoche)
and bomb defuser Kip (Navcen Andrews) is charming, and
would have been the perfect compliment to the main story if
Fiennes and Scott Thomas had been up to it. Sadly, they weren’t,
and the film misses its big opportunity. “The English Patient”
is well worth seeing for what’s there, but it can’t come together
with this huge flaw.

Danto’s lecture ‘over before it began’

BY DAVID KEELING
W&L CLASS or ’73

Professor Arthur C. Danto’s lec-
turelastwednesday eveningatduPont
Halleoneerningcognitionandtheceil-
ing of the Sistine Chapel was over, in
my opinion, almost before it began.
This Columbia University professor,
highly esteemed in the field of cogni-
tive and aesthetic philosophy, in im-
provised comments prior to reading
his lecture, said that it is only by writ-
ingaboutapaintingthata workcan be
understood.

Professor Danto earns his bread
and butter by the quantity and quality
of the words he delivers in the class-
room and publishes in text, so he
may be expected to have a bias
toward verbosity. lndeed his mas-
tery of language is of the highest
intellectual standard. However,
to say that a work of art cannot be
understood unless one writes about it,
is simply wrong.

There is a limit to the power of
words. Each defines, explains, pro-

vides understanding, but is unable to
give the full, complete meaning nec-
essary to dsseribe some works of art.
Words such as magnificent, supreme,
sublime, do their best to rise to the
heights of wonder or beauty in a
Michelangelo fresco, but they fail to
do it justice. That is the greatness of
the painter—~he is superior to our best
attempts at verbal description. The
wordsthemselves, however well used,
fail to describe the vastness, the
subtlety, the strength ofthe painting.
The artist takes us to heights which are
literally “beyond understanding.”
There is a sense ofawe in the spiri-
tual realm which some people experi-
ence——moments when they are over-
come, so impressed, perhaps so
humbled,thattheyareliterally“dumb-
struck.” Attempts to use words or to
express thoughts at such times are
unnecessary, trivial. One is speech-
less. The mind, which chooses the
words, which reasons and calculates
logically, isatsuch momentssilenced,
humbled in its inability to describe.
Those who are masters ofthe mind,
of the intellect and of its tools— the

are often unable to appreciate this
higher realm of spiritual awareness
which is beyond the cognitive mind.
The greatest artists help us to see this
vision,thisplacewhichoneeglimpsed,
orfelt, seems so powerful that it is said
by some to be the true reality. It is a
place beyond cognition, beyond un-
derstanding, beyond words; a place
which if Professor Danto had once
sensed, he seems to have forgotten.
Professor Danto gave a lecture
which he read verbatim from his text.
His melodiousvoiceandsophistieated
diction, delivered in a monotone, was
tiresome. Much of his lecture was
devoted to the old argument about the
cleaningofthe Sistine Chapel ceiling,
in which he suggested that his opin-
ions were at least as important asthose
who care for the Chapel itself. He
endedhislecturewitheommentsabout

Nietzsche,amongotherstandardphilo-

to enlarge upon his notion of “cogni-
tive pollution,” which he explained.

like a shoemaker, with a cocked hat and a leather apron. According to the
legend, leprechauns are aloof and unfriendly, live alone, and pass the time
making shoes they also possess a hidden pot of gold. Treasure hunters can
often track down a leprechaun by the sound of his shoemaker’s hammer. If
caught, he can be forced (with the threat of bodily violence) to reveal the
whereabouts of his treasure, but the captor must keep their eyes on him every
second. if the captor’s eyes leave the leprechaun (and he often tricks them into
looking away), he vanishes and all hopes of finding the treasure are lost.

The Blarney Stone is a stone set in the wall of the Blarney Castle tower in the
Irish village of Blarney. Kissing the stone is supposed to bring the kisser the
gift of persuasive eloquence (blarney). The castle was built in 1446 by Cormac
Laidhiv McCarthy (Lord of Muskerry) — its walls are 18 feet thick (necessary to
thwart attacks by Cromwellians and William lll’stroops). Thousands of tourists
a year still visit the castle.

Circus changes with times

Bg Anne Alvord
Phi Executive Editor

From Pompey’s Rome to today, the
circus is a beloved fonn of family enter-
tainment.

Roman circuses, like those today,
featured both animal and human enter-
tainment. Athletes fought to the death,
or to gain their freedom. Other enter-
tainments in the Roman circus were
chariot races and animal duels.

During the dark ages, circuses as
such died out, but traveling troupes of
entertainers and musicians kept the cir-
cus spirit alive. These traveling enter-
tainers often had animals and acrobats
as part of theirshow, just ascircuses do.

The circus reappeared in Britain. A
British cavalryman, Sergeant-Major
Philip Astley, loved to show off fancy
riding. Hetraveled through thecountry-
side showing his riding, as was the
fashion of the day. While stopping near

London, he roped off a field for his
performance. Soon, Astley perfected a
circusringtoshowoffhisabilitytostand
on the back of a cantering horse. The
riding performance came tobemingled
with clown antics. As time went on,
Astley covered part of his ring with a
roof and added  The modern
circus was born. Ast|ey’s advertising
became more elaborate, and the enter-

tainments of his show grew to include
tumbling, rope-walkingandjuggling. The
Amphitheater Riding School, as it was
called, was famous.
CnarlesHughwcompetedwithAstley.
He not only ran the English Royal Circus,
but trained trick riders. One of his pupils
was John Bill Ricketts, who brought the
circus to the colonies. In the new world,
Ricketts perfonned attheRidingSehoolin
Philadelphia.
Accordingtohistorians,theﬁrstAmeri-
can circus was held in 1793, in Philadel-
phia. It was put on by Ricketts. The show
was wildly successful, even attracting
George Washington in its audience. The
success inspired Ricketts to take the show
on a traveling tour of the U.S.’s major
cities, including Boston, New York and
Charleston. Ricketts constantly sought to
improve his circus. He added clowns,
acrobats and mimes, and in the late 1790s,
he built an amphitheater in Philadelphia to
house the show. The amphitheater was
destroyed by tire, and a discouraged
Ricketts left America to retum to England,
but he and his ship were lost in a storm.
The horse-dominated shows were
largely replaced in the early 19th century
by traveling shows that pitched their tents
on village greens. Lore says that these
circuses were started by “Old Bet”, a Afri-
can Elephant purchased by Hackaliah
Bailey in 1815. Bailey paid a sea captain
$1,000 for Old Bet and was successful

enough showing her to townspeople that
he purchased additional exotic animals
from other ship captains. Bailey traveled
at night to avoid free spectators, and exhib-
ited his animals in barns and other build-
ings. “Uncle Nate” Howes temporarily
took possession of Old Bet and exhibited
her under a round canvas top, the first
record of such a stmeture being part of a
traveling show.

Many others followed Ricketts’ ex-
ample and threw their hats into the circus
ring. The mostfamousofthesewasPhineas
T. Barnum, who would quickly eclipse
Ricketts’ prominence.

P.T. Barnum began as a newspaper
editor. He sold his newspaper, the Herald
of Freedom, in 1834 and moved to New
York with is wife and children.

Barnum purchased an elderly black
woman, Joiee Heth, who claimed to be
George Washington’s nursemaid. He ad-
vertised in local newspapers, and attracted
an audience curious to see the 161-year-
old woman. An autopsy after her death
proved the claim impossible, but Barnum
had already begun his career of making
money by entertaining people.

For over 20()0 years, the circus has
evolved with humanity. From the athletic
contests and chariot races of Rome to the
ﬂaming hoops and clown cars of today's
circuses, the circus continues to rcﬂect the
cultureofthetimewhilemaintainingcom-
mon traditions.

It’s a big job, but somebody has to do it

Melissa Courson, Fancy Dress Committee Chairperson, takes time out from the
planning to talk to the Phi about this year s ball, its planning and her expectations.

Why do you think this
year's theme translates
well for Fancy Dress?

The theme we’ve chosen
is fun and lends itself well
to bright colorful decorations
that stand out, that are recogniz-
able for students to see. I think
the decorations are bright and
attract a lot of attention.

What’s your favorite part
of this year’s ball?

The committee’s creativity
will show in lots of the decora-
tions. Everybody had a chance
to contribute to that.

How much money is be-
ing spent on this year’s
ball?Wheredoesthemoney
come from?

The budget this year is
around $68,000, which is
about normal for FD. We
receive no money from the
EC. We make it all through
ticket and memorabiliasales.

Is there anything differ-
ent or remarkable about this
year’s ball?

I think we’ve created a really
fun and exciting atmosphere.

How many people are
expected to attend?

We usually expect about
1,200 of the student body, but
that’s just undergraduate. lt
doesn’t include faculty or any-
thing either.

‘ Why is the theme kept a
secret?

It helps build suspense and
keeps people interested. When
we do release it, people get ex-
cited and they speculate about
decorations. lt’s a fun tradition
to keep it a secret.

Do you think FD should
be a costume ball?

I think that could be a really
fun idea, but it’s also fun to see

everyone in their formal wear. l
know that’s how it used to be,
and it might be fun to try again
one year.

How was the theme se-
lected?

When we take applications
we ask people to suggest three
themes. We put together a big
list and narrow it down to five,
then discuss the merits of each.
Thenthewholecommitteevotes.

What other themes were
considered?

Other themes we considered
were Mardi Gras, Through the
Decades, The Seven Wonders
of the World, and a Las Vegas/
Monte Carlo/Casino theme.

How are decorations se-
lected and organized?

We brainstorm when the
theme is selected, and we de-
cided we wanted to have more
of an old—fashioned circus than

a modern one.

The committee is broken
down into areas, and they de-
cide and finalize the details of
each area.

Will there be entertain-
ers or live animals this
year?

Therewillbeentertainers,but
no live animals.

What’sthehardestthing
aboutbeing FD chair? Will
being chair impede your
good time on the night of
the ball?

The hardest thing is keep- g

ing on top of every thing -
decorations, invitations,
memorabilia, the playbill..
There’s just so much plan-
ning that goes into the ball.

l’m excited to see all the
committcc’s work come to-
gether.

Do you have any goals

for this year’s FD? What
part of FD are you looking
forward to most?

ljust want everybody to have
agood time and be safe. l’m
most looking forward to see-
ing everybody have fun.

How did you decide you
wanted to be FD chair?
How were you selected?

I was on the steering com-
mittee since my freshman
year, and I decided I wanted
to be a part of planning it. l
interviewed with EC last
spring.

When do you start plan-
ning the ball?

We start planning in early
October. That’s when the com-
mittcc is chosen.

How many committee
members are there?

We have 48 people on the
committee.

urday nights for

G-Love and Speei

m miss-:'au  sane: swam

alSauee

merges musical styles

Bg Darceg Livingston
Phi Staff Writer

You may have spied them on Country
Music Television. Or on one of the side
stages during the 1995 H.O.R.D.E. festi-
val. You may have even seen G. Love
performing in Europe with last year's
Fancy Dress act-Coolio.

lf there was only one word to describe
the sound of G. Love and Special Sauce,
it would have to be eclectic.

The Times-Picayune described G.
l.oveas“a youngwhitehipsterimmersed
in black musical styles. Love doses his
music with hip-hop attitude, but is also a
disciple of old-school New Orleans
R&B.”

Also evident in the sound of G. Love
are his early influences of the Beastie
Boys, Run-DMC and blues guitarisat and
hamionica player John Hammond.

G. Love (a.k.a. Garrett Dutton) calls
his group’s music “ragmop.” He told
TheDenverPost, “I don’t think it’s blues
in the traditional sense. lt’s our own
form.”

The group has gone through some
personnel changes, but now consists of
the original drummer, Jeff Clemens, and
bassist King Kane. G. Love plays the
guitar, harmonica, and Dobro (the “rack”)
in addition to doing the vocals.

G. Love and Special Sauce have re-
leased two albums: a self-titled debut in

1994, and their follow-up titled, Coast to
Coast Motel in 1995. A third album is
now in the works in Philadelphia, and
The Orlando Sentinel reported that it
will feature a guest appearance by G.
Love’s greatest influence——John
Hammond.

In addition to playing with Special
Sauce, G. Love has a number of other
bands on the side.

One is called King’s Court, which has
more of a country feel. But, as G. Love
told the Sentinel, it is not country music
in the traditional sense.

“The country rceord’s cool,” said G.
Love. “lt has the instrumentation of a
country band, but it‘s definitely G. Love
singing country music; I’m rapping over
the country stuff halfthc time.”

Another one of his side projects is a
band called All Fellows. G. Love de-
scribed the band’s music to the Sentinel
as “Philidclphonic street-style blues, doo-
wop, hip-hop, in a way. l’m really excited
aboutthat. Drums, bass, pcrcussion,guitar,
andweallsing. lt’sactually prcttymuchall
dudes l’vc known my whole life, dudes 1
went to high school with.”

G. Love and special Sauce are hot on
stage, and their music ~ although practi-
callyindescribablcAisthctypcthat makes
everyone get up and dance. The Pavilion is
definitely the place to be this Thursday,
March 20 at 9 p.m. when G. Love and
SpecialSauceopen-upforATribc Called

Kings of Swing‘, Tyrone
Smith Revue promise to
keep ban guests dandng

The Kings of Swing have been
playingelassical swing and te best
of Beach, Motown and rock and
roll for over 20 years and still have
people of all ages crowding dance
floors up and down the east coast.

From a festive open-air concert
to the most ultra-formal black tie
affair, the Kings of Swing have
enthusiasm and showmanship that
are sure to please.

The exciting sound of the Kings
of swing is being heard on cam-
puses of major colleges and uni-
vcrsities, at wedding receptions
and retirement parties, and before
elite audiences at major socail and
special events.

ln addition to playing several
college events, the Kings ofSwing
have appeared at the 1982 Inaugu-
ral Ball of Governor Charles S.
Robb and the 1989 Inaugural Ball
of President George Bush.

The 14-piece band originated
12 years ago when the members
were students at the University of
Richmond. Playing such favorites
as Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman,
Count Basic and Woody Herman,

the Kings of Swing appeal to all
audiences and are sure to delight
their audience in the Big Gym Fri-
day night.

While the Kings of Swing play
in the Big Gym, a band of an en-
tirely different nature, the Tyrone
Smith Revue, will be playing in
the Small Gym.

What separates the Tyrone
Smith revue from other great dance
bands in the Louisville area? Au-
dience participation.

Who wouldn’t what tojump up
on stage with a 5’7” black man
who wears a superman outfit?
Surely not the guests at FD. Tyrone
Smith and his wacky cohorts may
well be the biggest clowns of all
under W&L’s Big Top.

‘Smith originated the Revue
when he was in college. Origi-
nally called Tyrone Smith and the
lnvaders, the Revue has been im-
pressing audiences all across the
Southeast. From clubs in Mem-
phis and Atlanta to formal events
in Richmond and Charleston, the
Revue promises to get everyone

hopping.

H all ebe fails, steal someone else’s date

"6-Love and
Tabasco Sauce‘ Mctvtanernin.

Well, Fancy Dress time is here,
which means one thing — lots of
boring campus columnists are going
to be yapping on about what to wear,
whom to take, etc. Well, not this
boring campus columnist. No, sir,
this talentless hack is going to be
telling you all about another fun FD
activity —- stealing your friends’
dates.

Allow me to set up the situation.
You’ve decided to go with a “friend”
(in other words, the Pope has a better
chance of getting some this weekend), or
worse. You may have relied on a random
hook-up, or agreed to go with someone
you’ve never met, but your friends say
“has a nice personality”.

Now, remember, saying someone “has
a nice personality” is like saying that
they're “well spoken”. In other words,
you can’t think of a single real com-
pliment to give.

So you end up going with Bertha,
the 300 pound Nazi lesbian biker
chick. Or, for women, you end up
with Dementia, the pale, 95-pound
Marylin Manson fanatic who’s certain
he's a vampire.

Despite your date’s nice personality,
you’re not having a good time. How can

you salvage this weekend?

All you have to do is steal the attrac-
tive dates your socially superior dates
have snagged.

Butstealing, you say, isn’tthatagainst
the Honor System? Well, yes, but no.
You see, ifyou read the bylaws carefully,
you’ll find that the Honor System is
suspended during FD weekend. This law
is meant to protect guys who might like
to say “l’ll love you forever” or “Of
course l’ll call” without worrying about
being booted out of school for lying.

(Note — If you actually read the by-
laws, you'll ﬁnd that [just made all this
up. Now don't you feel like a dork for
reading the bylaws?)

The easiest way to steal a date is to get
your friend nice and drunk, passed out,
covered in his own vomit, lying fetal
position in the corner. Then simply move
in on the lonely date.

Ofcourse, your friend might be one of
those people who can handle large
amounts ofalcohol without showing any
signs ofdrunkcnness (slurring ofspcech,
troublewalking, voting democratic,ctc.),
In this case, more tact is needed. Try
casually addressing one of the following
phrases to your friend when his date is
within earshot:

' “Pick up the phone, it’s your
parole officer.”

' “Pick up the phone, it’s the VD
clinic.”

by university librarian

By Anne Alvord
Phi Executive Editor

n 1907, Annie Jo

Robertson White and a

handful of Washington
and Lee students created the first
Fancy Dress Ball. The theme was
Bal Masque.

Admission to this ﬁrst ball was
free, and costumes cost about
$2.00. The ball was created with
$44, funck leﬁ over from theatre
production proceeds. Music was
provided by an orchestra from
Virginia Military Institute, who
were known for their knowledge
of the latest two-steps of the day.

When White and her students
ﬁr! organized the ball, it was met
with indifference by students, but
opinions quickly changed.

White, called “MissAnnie” by
students, was the university li-
brarian at thetime. She was dearly
loved by the university commu-
nity. One crew boat in the 18905
was named Annie Jo alter the
energetic librarian.

White had a run-in with the
law during Prohibition, when she

purchased bottles of rum and
scotch through the mail. Univer-
sity President Henry L. Smith in-
tervened, preventing a grand jury
indictment.

The Calyx wrote of White in
1908, “Admiration of her is
stamped forever on our minds;
love for her is seated deep in our
hearts; respect for her is impressed
indelibly on our souls.”

In the 19305, White was fea-
tured in Life magazine for her
accomplishments.

White has not only been im-
mortalized in the continuing tra-
dition of Fancy Dress, but also in
Leybum Library's computerized
catalog. The name “Annie” was
chosen because it is short, easy to
pronounce and spell, and has sig-
niﬁcant W&L connections, Uni-
versity Librarian told a Phi re-
porter researching White in 1994.

White was appointed Univer-
sity Librarian in l895. She retired
in 1928 and died in 1938. She
attended every Fancy Dress ex-
cept one from 1 907 until her death.

Research from 1992 and 1994

Circus workers typically work every day for months on end, often as much as 11
months a year with only a few weeks off around Christmas, during which the new year's

edition is organized.

Constantly moving from one town to another, the members of a circus form a very
tightly knit family. Holidays are celebrated enmassi and weddings are often celebrated
in the center ring. The community tends to be extremely liberal and tolererrt of diversity
within its ranks, but wary of outsiders.

Because of the long tradition of the circus. and its isolation fromthe outside, the circus
has largely developed a culture of its own. with its own jargon and traditions.

Special interest money also rampant in the Republican Congress

The recent and often raucous fin-

engaging in the past few weeks re-

used in the ’96 campaign has served

They are hypocritical, bitter partisans
that would have used any issue to

possible. Too bad they chose an issue
in which they are just as guilty.

How soon we forget Newt

he may use his campaign war chest to
pay his $300,000 fine. Are the sup-
porters ofsuch a “deal” for Gingrich
for real?

tionsofthe spirit ofcampaign finance

Clinton, ought to be forced to bear the
entire burden of the punishment.

Even further evidence of such in-
justice in campaign finance on the
other side of the aisle is with Senator
Alfonse D’Amato (R-NY). He has
already amassed a campaign fund of
over $2 million dollars for his re-
election efforts. Hc had made it nearly
impossible foran_v challenger-- with-
out D’Amato’s name recognition nor
the ability to raise nearly the same
amount of money-- to mount a win-
ning eampaign. He has, in essence,
bought his re-election.

The problem that the 17th Amend-
ment sought to correct in 1913 by
requiringthepopularelectionofSena-
tors has returned. It has become clear
thatthetimehas cometimeforchange
on both ends of the mall, both the
executive and legislative branches.

l\vill not use this column todefend
theactionsofPresidcnt Clinton. There
have been some definite breeches of
the law that do warrant further inves-
tigation. But President Clinton's ac-
tions are not the problem. There are a
mere symptom of a plague that is not
only ruining the character and pur-
pose ofour electionsbut infectingour
eiitire system of government as well.

It should be that ideas count more
than money. ft is clear thought that

this is presently not the case.
Theodore Sorensen, in “Why I Am
a Democrat,” states it best: “What
a tragedy that the.world’s leading
democracy features the \vorld’s
mostexpensive political campaign
system, requiring most candidates
in both parties to spend a majority
of their campaign hours not dis-
cussing or studying issues, but par-
ticipating in a process that inher-

ently smacks of conflicts of inter-
est and corruption.”

Don’t the American people
want representatives that have the
best ideas and not the best tech-

‘Scandal not limited to exeeuive branch

niques for raising money?

Americans need to examine the
role that money and influence
plays in our democracy. It is quite
clear that the recent debates in
Congress regardingtelecommuni-
cations, electricity deregulation
and most notoriously, health care,
all smacked of special interest
money. Surely, the system that
we have now is not what the
founders ever intended or could
have imagined. ln Federalist #10,
Jant;-s Madison warns us of the
danger of factions on the legisla-
tive process. \\-"hat not
predict was the influence of fac-
tions or special interests on cam-
paigns. lle assumed that the elec-
tions of public figures would rest
on the competition between ideas.
This system has been destro_ved
b_v the deleterious effects of
money-interests.

In order to fix this problem and
to ensure the continuation of our
system of democracy, what we
need is a bipartisan effort which
would change the laws to stress
ideas and the greatest public good
over the intercs_t of the factions.
Only then will we have a func-
tioning democracy that best fits
the founders’ intentions.

MARCH 24, 1997

 

Fancy Dress weekend is com ing to
a close. lt was my finest one ever, and
I saw things that I will always remem-
bcr— from some girl who fell flat on
her drunken back at the ball to my
friend Jon getting stopped by the cops
three times in four blocks. But now all

GreenLand
Betsy Green ’97

that remains is a pile ofparty pic slips
on my dresser, the SAB stamp on my
hand and the lingering taste of the
cigar l smoked after the ball.

So I guess it’s time to move on to
the next glamorous event—tonight
(assuming you read this on Monday)
is Oscar night.

l’ve heard a lot of people complain
about the Oscars. The show is too
long, thcjokes arcn’t funny and so on.
But I love the Oscars. I love seeing
what everyone wears. I can’! \vait to
hearthc silly songs Billy Crystal makes
up. I love everything from the mind-
less banter to the cheesy dance mem-
bers.

I read that this year plain folks like
you and me were able to submit jokes
to the Oscars over the lnternet. I
wanted to swamp them with really
good stuff like about how men always
leave the toilet seat up.

Up for Best Picture this year are
“Secrets and Lies,” “Fargo,” “The
English Patient,” “Shine” and
“Jerry Maguirc.” The only ones
l’ve seen are “Fargo” and “Jerry
l\/laguire.” Maybe it’s me, but I
don’t expect “Shine” to be hitting
the State Theater any time soon.
One can’t help but feel a tad unso-
phisticated. Sure, maybe l won’t
have much opportunity to see Cool
independent movies, but anything with
.lonathan Taylor-Thomas in it. I can
see anytime.

So, my choice is between “Fargo"
and “Jerry Maguire.” “Jerry
M aguire” was a real ly good movie.
I thought it would be a nice ro-
mantic comedy, but there was a
lot more to it than that. But can
you honestly say it was the best
movie of the entire year‘? That it

 

 

should get the same honor as
“Bra\'eheart” or ‘‘Schindler’s
List?” 'l'herc’sjust no way. “l’argo,"
on the other hand, was great. It was
dark, it was funny and it had an amaz-
ing performance by Frances
McDonald.

Here are someofmy othcrthoughts
about nominees. Ralph Fiennes is up
for Best Actor for his role in “The
English Patient.” Ficnnes really irks
me since he pronounces his first name
“Ralf.” Until the man admits his name

is Ralph —— “Rallt” —— he’ll get no
Oscar from me. l’d rather give it to
someone with a good honest, non-
pretentious name like Woody
H arrelson or Billy Bob Thorton.
There are some great nominees for
Best Supporting Actor. Ed Norton’s
performance in “Primal Fear” was
outstanding. Too had everything
else about the movie sucked. Wil-
liam H. Macy was fantastic in
“Fargo." l-le was twiteliy, ner-
vousand pathetic. You wanted to
smack him the entire time. Out-
standing. But l’ll have to go with
Cuba Gooding, Jr. from “Jerry
Maguire.” He was good and every-
thing, but I give him the edge for
showing his butt. Film needs more.

“Bela Fleck and the Flecktones“
blends banjo and harmonica with synthe-
sized percussion to deliver a butt-kicking

The band will play at Waslrington and
Lee University Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. in
the Pavilion. The doors will open at 7:30.
and there will be a beer garden for anyone
over 21.

Bela Fleck “caught the banjo bug from
the Beverly Hillbillies theme. and his first
banjo came at age 15,” according to an
interview with Nathan Torkington. Fleck
was playing folk guitar before he received
a banjo from his grandfather. The progress
he made on the banjo astounded even his
guitar teacher. “Suddenly I got into the

‘Y banjo. and he was shocked at how fast I
took to that,” Fleck said.

Fleckattended the New York City I Iigh
School of Music and Art. playing in the
band “Wicker’s Creek" in the evenings.
After graduating from high school. Fleck
attended the .lrrIliard Ijxtension School for
a short period of time before rrrovirrg to
Boston to play in the band "Tasty licks,"
fronted by Jack Tottle.

The first recorded appearance of Fleck

later joined the group “Spectrum” and
toured with them until 1980, when lie was

some instrumental music  we don’t know

thought that the students coming out for ice cream would keep
trs going in the winter when the business got slow.”

“Sweet Things" replaced the “Palm Parlor” (now the stu-
dents’ favorite bar) as the only ice cream shop in I.e.\ington.
"When we came, they were already switching away from ice
cream as their main priority,” Koehler said. "They were nice
enough to start sending customers asking for ice cream over to us.”

Koehler has few complaints about running a small business
and saysthey are doing well financially. The drawbacks include
long hours and less time with their 9-year-old daughter Heather.
“I like talking to all ofthe students and the tourists. But I never
have a day off,” Koehler said. “Roger is here in the afternoon
and I’m here at night.”

All twenty-four ﬂavors are home-made. “Sweet Things” is
an experience that cannot be re-created at just any home, though.
Only Roger Koehler knows the secret recipes, and he isn’t about
to dish out that scoop.

WASHINGTON & LEE UNIVERSITY

Students re-enact Civil War life

BY TARAH GRANT
PHI NEws EDITOR

Across the street from the freshman park-
ing lot, there is a row of C ivil War cloth tents,
and a woman in a hoop skirt and bonnet
stands over an open ﬁre, stirring a kettle of
beans. Three men, dressed in Confederate
uniforms and carryin g muskets, emerge from
the woods behind the Liberty Hall Ruins.
Their hand-made leather shoes kick at the
tow path, causing little clouds of dust to form
around their feet.

“I think them boys got lost in the woods, ”
one of the soldiers says.

His friend wipes the sweat from his

forehead. He thinks the Yankees are hiding.

“Maybe they think they ’re going to ambush
us or something. ”

The alluring scent of lunch drifting from
the camp quickens their pace. “ Well, they ’re
going to be waiting a while, ” the third adds‘,
and the hungry men laugh

Washington and Lee University’s Lib-
erty Hall Volunteers sponsored a Civil War
living history demonstration at the Liberty
Hall Ruins Saturday to share theirhobby with
other students. The event included a Civil
Warcamp, a morning bayonet exercise, Civil
War music, ﬁring demonstrations and what
Lieutenant Leo Decanini (‘95) described as
“really nasty, raunchy food” which guests
were invited to sample.

“We try to portray the lifestyle of the
original company,” Decanini said. “We try
to educate others, but it’s mostly to educate
ourselves about what [the Liberty Hall Vol-
unteers] went throug .”

“And believeitornotitisﬁIn,”said Ginny
Windley from Stuarts Draft. “If you like to
camp and you have an interest in history, then
you can combine the two.”

Twenty students are involved with the re-
enactment group dominated by male partici-

pants. “There are a few girls in the unit too,
but we try to portray the actual Liberty Hall
Volunteerswhich\didn’tinclude any females,”
Decanini said. Female members dress in
period clothing and act as camp followers,
nurses, cooks and mouming widows.

The group participates in approximately
10 events per year, including re-enactments,
living histories, parades, barn dances and
class demonstrations.

Battle re-enactments are usually a week-
end event. The participants set up camp
Friday evening and receive battle strategies
and itineraries. There are battles all Saturday
and a final battle Sunday afternoon.

“It’s generally a pretty hard way to spend
your weekend,” Decanini said. “You learn
a lot more from spending time on the ﬁeld
than you do from reading in class. You learn
how cold it really was during the war, how
many days in a row you can be wet, how long
you can go without sleep, how sore your feet
can be.”

Washington and Lee University alumni have
been known to hold positions of power in Con-
gress, the Supreme Court and other institutions.
But few, if any, of them could claim to have

operated on a president with a bum
knee. Dr. Joseph Campbell Jr., W&L
‘86, is one of those few.

On March 14, President Bill
Clinton stumbled and injured his
knee while staying with Professional
Golfer Greg Norman at his home in
Florida.

Doctors described the damage done to
the President’s knee as “substantial,” but
the operation wasa fairly common pro-
cedure with no anticipated problems,
according to K.P. Foley of Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty, Inc.

The most memorable re-enactment for
Corporal ErikSampson, Liberty Hall Volun-
teers’ President, was in Standardsville two
years ago. The Confederacy was planningto
have an open morning battle and the generals
selected a couple of companies, W&L’s
being one of them, to march out to the
battleﬁeld the night before and hold a bridge
all morning until the rest of the army came
around and met them.

‘fWe went out there very quietly and very
secretly and got everything organized,”
Sampson said. “It got down to 20 degrees or
something that night, and [each of us] only
had two blankets if we were lucky, most only
had one blanket. So, we were basically lying
out on this bare hill, not unlike it would have
been up here on the Ruins, with the winds
blowingover us and just about freezing. And
the next morning didn’t quite go as planned
so it was kind of a disappointment.”

“[The Union troops] knew we were there,
and the battle started without us,” Decanini

said. “So we did all that for nothing.”

“Those are the kind of experiences you
read about but you don’t understand until you
do them,” Sampson said.

The majority of the members consider
themselves to be “Civil War buffs.” In
addition to participating in events, the mem-
bers spend their time reading and learning
about the original Liberty Hall Volunteers.

The “original, original” Liberty Hall Vol-
unteers were students at W&L, then Liberty
Hall Academy, who formed a company to
help protect the Shenandoah Valley from the
British in the Revolutionary War, according
to Decanini. When the Civil War started,
studentsrecreatedtheoompanytoﬁghtagainst
the Yankees. The names of the 79 men,
mostly W&L students and graduates, who
composed the Liberty Hall Volunteers Co. I,
4th VA Infantry are inscribed on a plaque
inside Lee Chapel. Through the course of the
war, approximately 140 men eventually
joined the corps as replacements.

The biggest research project for the group

first year law students guilty of “drunken bellig-

At approximately 2 a.m. on the last day of
February break, the two drunken students mis-
took C2 in Woods Creek East for the apartment
above it, one of the C2 residents Sophomore
Becca Harris said.

After climbing up to the balcony, they entered
the second story apartment through the balcony
door, which was not locked. Harris said she
heard the men searching the apartment for some-
thing to eat.

Kendra Archer, another C2 resident, was sleep-
ing in her bedroom when she heard the men in the
apartment. They pounded on Archer’s bedroom
door, but she had locked it before she went to
sleep. When the males realized they had entered
the wrong apartment, they started joking about
how the residents must think they were Charles
Manson, Archer said.

‘‘It was very amusing,” Archer said. “I wasn‘t
scared, but I’m glad my bedroom door was locked.”

As soon as the men left the apartment. they
were arrested by the police. Neither Archer or
Harris called the police, however Harris speculates
they were keeping an eye on the apartments because
it had been a night of “revelry.”

Reflections on receiving an Oscar

This week, for the first time in my

year. The nominations were unique in
that I hadn’t seen a single one ofthem.
Consequently, I believe I should have

have been truly objective.
As you know, the awards are not
' decided by judges. (Had they been,
I’m sure “The English Patient” would
have won anyway for its spectacular
performance in the Swimsuit Event.)
Instead, they are voted on by the entire
academy, and electoral votes are del-
egated depending on how a certain
genre of actors voted.
For instance, ifthe majority ofcom-
edy actors voted for “Fargo,” then the
movie would receive three electoral

votes. If the majority of dramatic
actors voted for “Shine,” it would
receive five electoral votes. If the
majority of twisted, artistic,

In Phi time, we have come upon

to commemorate it than to review the
major news stories of the year?

Hazing. I don’t know if anyone
remembers this, but earlier this year,
The New York Times published some
pictures of fraternities at an unnamed

school engaged in hazing. It was rather
damning that most of the pictures in
the article are in the brochures W&L
sends to prospective students. The
administration immediately clamped
down on hazing and made certain that
fraternities would not haze or have a
hell week. A few incidents of hazing
were reported, in which freshmen were
forced to listen to upperclassmen bitch
about how easy the freshmen had it and
how winter rush sucks. In an unrelated
event, last week most of the freshmen men

Ring—tum Phinancial Troubles. You

. may have read in that other campus news-

paper that the Phi had a few ﬁnancial
troubles this year. (Apparently, in fact, the
paper tried to save money for the last two
weeks by usingconsiderablylessinkon the
pages.) The Phi plans to regain some of
those lossesby simply re-issuingold news-
papers, cutting back staff trips to our Cay-
man Island condominium and switching
from imported to domestic beer. At this
time, we’d like to offer some ﬁnancial tips
to help others avoid falling into the same
troubles we did.

(1) If someone writes you acheck,
cash it.

(2) You can be overdréfwn and '

still have checks left.

(3) Do not hire Willie Nelson as
your business manager.

Kappa Delta colonized. Wash-

ington and Lee added a fifth sorority
this year, Kappa Delta. Rush was
successful for KD, and the women are
eager to begin new traditions on cam-
pus. Kady, a new initiate, told the Phi,
“I think KD will really feel they are
part ofthis campus when other sorori-
ties create an insulting deviation of
our name. Also, when people start to
stereotype us. Then we’ll know we’ve
really arrived.”

Phi Delt and Sigma Nu go dry. In
one of the stupidest moves of all time,

the nationals of Phi Delta Theta and
Sigma Nu fraternities have declared
their intentions to ban all alcohol from
the fraternities by the year 2000. As if
not getting to haze the pledges weren’t
bad enough. Upperclass Phi Delis and
Sigma Nus all agreed that “This blows.
I’m glad l’ll be out of here before that
happens.” Freshmen simply wept,
though perhaps it was from the com-
pletely coincidental lack of sleep they
all had experienced in the past week.
Glen vs. Alex: The Debate That
Wasn’t. Throughout the pages of that
other newspaper, a war of words waged
between conservative humor colum-
nist Glenn Miller and G&L President
Alex Christensen. Alex challenged

strangely enough, “delegates.” After
these votes are cast, they are brought
to the President of the Academy, Os-
car. Oscar then shreds and burns all of
these votes and awards the Golden
Baby to the producer who has the
thickest glasses.

This year, however, something
went awry in that there was appar-
ently a tie between the producers of
“The English Paper” and “Jerry
McGuire.” Rather than moving to
the directors’ glasses, which I would
have suggested, they gave the award
to the only movie with the word “the”
in it. I was furious. By that reason-
ing, “The Cable Guy” should have at
leastbeen nominated.

Anyway, I got to thinking about
the lucky few who get to receive such
a tremendous honor and what I would
do in their situation. I came up with
this, my acceptance speech.

“Wow. I don’t know what to say.
[Standard intro.] I can’t tell you how
much this means to me. [More stan-

dard intro.]

“You know, fifteen years ago, I
would have never pictured myself here.
Then again, I was also a 3 year old

here I am.

“I couldn’t have achieved this
award for Best Audience Member at a
Jim Carrey Screening without the help
of several special people. I first would
like to thank Jim Carrey for making
the movie. I also would like to thank
my parents, who gave me the money
for an education, little knowing what
I’d become by spending that money
on popcorn and Juju Fruits. Finally,
I’d like to thank the Pepto Bismol
company for helping me be the only
one in the theater to sit through such a
horrible film.

to know why Glenn has only made fun of

Sexual misconduct~

definition

Rape. It is one of those four letter
words that is still considered taboo.

According to Webster's Dictionary
rape is deﬁned as: “sexual intercourse

consent and chiefly by force or decep-
tion or unlawful sexual intercourse by
force or threat other than by a man
with a woman.”

What is your definition of rape?
Many colleges across the nation are
redefining the definition to include
provisions for date rape and a type of
rape classiﬁed as sexual misconduct.
Under these provisions students,
mostly male, are prosecuted for hav-
ing intercourse with a drunk female.
In fact, at Brown University an indi-
vidual can be convicted of sexual mis-
conduct if a person is aware of intoxi-
cation or should have been aware of
intoxication.

Here at Washington and Lee irre-
sponsible and excessive drinking is
common, but are students being taken
unfair advantage oi‘? Does our policy
on sexual misconduct allow excessive
drunkenness to become an excuse for
behavior?

According to the Student Hand-
book Policies and Procedures for the
1996-97 school year, sexual miscon-
duct is defined as“inappropriate physi-
cal conduct or threat of a sexual na-
ture.” '

One of the examples given for
sexual misconduct that could be inter-
preted to apply to our discussion is
“Sexual intercourse without consent —
by means of force, threat, intimidation
or victim incapacity.”

I take incapacity to mean passed
out. This leaves a wide range of other
possibilities. What if consent is given,
but not remembered in the morning?
Do we allow the males on this campus
to use drunkeness as an excuse as
well? Does the defense of “I didn’t
know what I was doing” hold up for
both males and females? These are

questions each of needs to-answer to '

the satisfaction of the parties. The
mediator cannot impose sanctions. It
appears to me that the real power lies
in this position, especially for the gray
area of drunken sexual misconduct.
The mediator is the first to hear com-
plaints, and it is her job to find an
informal resolution.

If the mediator cannot resolve the
conﬂict and the complainant wants to
go ahead, the case is heard by the
SFHB. These are the people who
make the final judgment as to whether
the action is indeed sexual miscon-
duct or merely irresponsibility.

Our policy is certainly not on the
same level as Brown University, but
we also don’t have any protection to
guard against such claims. There are

UVH Spanish Theater group

BY DAVID BALSLEY
PHI FEATURES EDITOR

If “Evita” piqued your interest in His-
panic culture, the next production to visit
Johnson Theater may be right for you.

The University of Virginia Spanish
Theater Group will present “Don Fausto”
Saturday in Johnson Theater. The perfor-
mance, which is being sponsored by the
Lectures Committee, combines the Faust
story with Argentinean culture.

The University of Virginia Spanish
Theater Group specializes in “producing
plays written in Spanish for North Ameri-
can audiences,” according to the play’s
handbill. Since its incarnation in 1980,
the group has performed at universities in
Virginia, Washington, D.C., North Caro-
lina and other neighboring states. The
troupe returns to Washington and Lee

  

after appearing here as part of the Na-
tional Symposium on Theater in Aca-
deme last year.

“It’s an amateur group, but the perfor-
mances are incredible,” Assistant Pro-
fessor of Romance Languages Cathleen
Cuppett said. Cuppett, who performed
with the group for two years while doing
her graduate work at UVA, is coordinat-
ing the troupe’s visit.

“Don Fausto,” the group’s current pro-
duction, sets the Faust story in Argen-
tina. The play depicts Don Fausto’s de-
sire to be young; his consequent tempta-
tion by Juan Sombra, the devil; and his
lust for Margarita, a woman who is much
younger than himself. The play will fea-
ture traditional Argentinean dance and
costume.

The visit by the University of Virginia
Spanish Theater Group offers several op-
portunities to students, including the

chance to enrich their understanding of
Spanish, as well as the occasion to meet
published Spanish authors.

“It’s promoting Hispanic culture and
language,” Cuppett said of the play. “It
takes language out of the classroom, out
of the textbook, and makes it alive.”

In addition, four of the actors in the
play are professors, representing the coun-
tries of Columbia, Peru and Spain. One

.of the professors is a published Spanish
poet. Another is the UVA writer-in-resi-
dence, an Argentine novelist who has
based a character of one of his novels on
W&L’s Associate Professor of Romance
Languages Jeffrey Barnett. The Lectures
Committee will sponsor a reception in
Gaines Gatehouse immediately follow-
ing the performance to allow students to
meet these writers and professors.

“How often does an Argentine novel-
ist come to W&L?” Cuppett asked.

The play should be enjoyable for stu-
dents who may not have a strong back-
ground in Spanish.

“The director told me that this play is
more accessible because of the familiar-
ity of the Faust story and also because of
the singing and dancing in the play,”
Cuppett said.

In addition, an English plot summary
will be provided.

Cuppett encourages students and fac-
ulty to attend the performance.

“They come right to our doorstep: you
just have to walk to Lenfest,” Cuppett
said.“They do fabulous productions.”

Keeping with your regular hedule wiﬂ help

As ﬁnals week slowly begins to sneak
up on us, most Washington and Lee stu-
dents have been hit by an endless stream
of papers, tests and stress. Luckily, there
are several simple things you can do to
help make it through the week.

“There is a good deal of data that
supports the idea that spreading out
studying helps students to remember
much more,” said Professor Leonard
Jarrard, Professor of Psychology.
“Gradual studying so much better than
cramming.”

Jarrard alsopointsoutthatbyspread-
ing studying over a week or more,
students will feel much less stress right
before the test.

“I think the most important thing
anyone can do is keep generally to the
schedule that they are used to. Any
dramatic change in the schedule can
seriously affect their circadian rhythm

According to Cuppett, this is a rare

and only add to stress,” Jarrard said.

For this reason, Jarrard does not
recommend that students get any spe-
cifrc amount of sleep. A recent report
argued that students should aim for
eight hours of sleep a night and ten
during stressful times. Jarrard does
not see this as the best policy.

“Each individual needs a different
amount of sleep. Some people are ﬁne
on four or six hours; othersneed ten.
The main thing is to get plenty of rest
but to stick to the schedule that your
body is accustomed to.”

This policy also applies to eating
and exercise.-

“Students should make an effort to
eat at the same time every day. It
keeps the body in the rhythm that it is
used to. As for exercising, if a student
is used to exercise, it is important to
keep doing it. It may help relieve
some stress. But again, it all depends
on the individual.”

As for “caffeine enhancers,” they
are also interruptions to the body’s

during

natural cycle. Water Joe, coffee and
other caffeine-rich drinks keep you
awake, but they are no substitute for
sleep.

“They‘are effective in keeping you
awake but, again, your body’s circa-
dian rhythm will be out of alignment,”
Jarrard said.

In the end, a tired mind remembers
much less than a rested one.

There are also certain depressants
which should be avoided, such as alcohol.

“Alcohol contains a nervous system
suppresser which lowers the activation
level of the brain. Even a very small
amount can interfere with attention to
detail and memory. It is probably the
worst thing that a student could do during
exams,” Jarrard said.

Jarrard’sbasic message wasclear: plan
ahead and keep to your regular schedule.
Naturally, finals are a stressful time, espe-
cially when the warming weather calls.

“By spreading out studying and keep-
ing to a schedule, things should go much
easier,” Jarrard said.

Jean—Louis “Jack” Kerouac was born
intoarrriddle-class French—Canadian fam-
ily, in Lowell, Mass. As a small child he
learned to speak a local dialect of French
called joual before speaking English. The
youngest of three children, Kerouac be-
came terribly upset when his older brother
Gerard died of rheumatic fever at the age
of nine.

Known as Ti Jean as a child, Kerouac
was described as serious and intense, a
boy who loved his mother and continually
formed friendships with other boys. (This
would carry on for the rest of his life.)
Kerouac wrote stories from a young age.
He was first inspired by the radio show
“The Shadow” and later by the writer
Thomas Wolfe.

Kerouac’s family began to suffer fr-
nancial difficulties when his father began
to gamble in the hope of restoring the
family to the prosperity it lost when their
hometown economy declined. Kerouac
hoped to save his family by obtaining a
college football scholarship and entering
the insurance business. A star back on his
high school football team, Kerouac re-
ceived a scholarship to Columbia Univer-
sity.

Columbia was where things began to
go wrong. Kerouac fought with the foot-
ball coach, who then refused to let him
play. Kerouac’s father lost his business
before becoming an alcoholic. Confused
and depressed, Kerouac dropped out of
Columbia, greatly disappointing his fa-
ther. He joined the military (World War II
had begun) and ended up a sailor in the
Merchant Marines.

When not in uniform, Kerouac hung
out in New York with an “unsavory”
group consisting of depraved young Co-
lumbia students Allen Ginsberg and
Lucien Carr, an older friend named Wil-
liam S. Burroughs and Neal Cassady, a
“street cowboy” from Denver.

Kerouac had begun to write his first
novel, very stylistically reminiscent of
Thomas Wolfe, about trying to balance
his “wild city life” with his “old-world
family values.” The manuscript was ap-
preciated by Kerouac’s “group,” and
Ginsberg asked his Columbia professors
to help ﬁnd a publisher for the work. “The

the   eat

neration by remembering’ Jaolz Kerouac

Town and the City” was Kerouac’s ﬁrst
and most conventional work; It earned
him some recognition as a writer but did
not make him famous.

While working on his novel, Kerouac
had taken some amazing cross-country
trips with Cassady and began experiment-
ing with freer forms of writing, partly
inspired by the “unpretentious spontane-
ous prose” of Cassady’s letters. He wrote
about the trips exactly as they had hap-
pened “without pausing to edit, ﬁctional-
ize or even think.” The resulting manu-
script became “On the Road” which was
not to be published until seven years later.

Kerouac spent the early 1950’swritin g
one unpublished novel after another. He
carried them in a rucksack as he traveled
“back and forth across the country.” He
traveled to San Francisco where he found
enlightenment through Buddhism. The
novel “The Dharma Burns” tells of a 1955
mountain climbingtripto Yosemitewhich
Kerouac took with Zen poet Gary Snyder.
The book describes the steps he and his
friends were taking towards spiritual
realization.

His fellow starving artists were be-
coming known as the “Beat Generation,”
a term coined by Kerouac in a conversa-
tion with novelist John Clellon Holmes.
In 1955, Ginsberg and Snyder became
“underground celebrities” after the Six
Gallery poetry reading. Since his fellow
writers tended to refer to Kerouac as the
most talented among them, publishers
began to express interest in the manu-
scripts which Kerouac carried in his ruck-
sack. In 1957, “On the Road” was ﬁnally

published and become a huge success.
After years of rejection, Kerouac did not
know how to react. He was older, sadder
and more intelligent than people expected
him to be. Literary critics refused to
take the Beat “fad” seriously and, there-
fore, refused to take Kerouac seriously as
a writer. They even began to ridicule his
work. Kerouac was hurt. He knew the
Beat Generation was a fad, but his own
writing was not.

His sudden celebrity became
Kerouac’sdownfall. To live up to hiswild
image he developed a severe drinking
habit. He found no answer in Buddhism,
and his friends began to view him as
“needy and unstable.” Kerouac could no
longer function as a writer.

In 1961, trying to recover from his

Men’s tennis splits
weekend matches

PHI EDITORIAL EDITOR

The men’s tennis team split their
weekend matches, losing to Averett
College 4-3, but rebounding Sunday
against Middlebury 6-1. The Gener-
als improved their record to 8-4.

Leading the Generals were junior
Glenn Miller and senior Damian
Brady. Neither Miller nor Brady
dropped a set in their two matches.

The match against Averett on
Thursday disheartened the Gener-
als as the top three seeds of senior
Peter Hammond, sophomore Dale
Pretila and senior Chris Higgs all
droppedtheir matches. Hammond
shutout his opponent after drop-
ping the first set, but could not
hold on for the win.

Posting wins for the Generals were
sophomore Scott Babka, playing in
the fourth slot; Brady, playing in the
fifth slot and Miller, playing in the
sixth slot. Only the team of Higgs and
Brady won a doubles match.

“We turned in a lackluster perfor-
mance against Averett,” said Miller,
“but our lineup is performing consis-
tently at a high level.’’ ’ " ‘ 1

Yesterday, the Generals proved that
statement against Middlebury.
Hammond, Higgs, Brady and Miller
won in straight sets. Pretila dropped
the second set but came back to win, 6-
3, 5-7, 6-3.

Against Middlebury, the doubles
teams of Higgs-Miller and Hammond-
Pretila won easily. Babka and Brady
also won their doubles match.

“One positive thing to take out of
this win were the changes we made in
the doubles 1ineup,” said Miller. The
changes allowed the Generals to sweep
doubles play against Middlebury.

Despite the split, the men are up-
beat about the rest of the season. “If
everyone turns their play up a notch,
we have a good shot at regiona1s,” said
Pretila.

The men will be in action once
more before exams. They play at
Lynchburg on Wednesday.

Womens’ lacrosse gets two impressive wins

Junior Lorraine Taurassi moves to ninth on all-time scoring list.

The Generals’ women’s lacrosse
team improved to 9-1 this past week
with impressive wins over Colby Col-
lege and Mary Washington College. 7

J u n i o r
L o r r a i n e
Taurassi netted
nine goals in the
two games, in-
cluding seven in
the Generals’ 16-
5 win over Mary
Washington on
Saturday.

Theninegoals
gave Taurassi 30 goals for the season,
and place her ninth on the W&L all-
time scoring list. She only needs five
more to move into seventh place.

Heading into the second half, W&L
was leading Mary Washington 5-2.
Taurassi took over, scoring five of her
seven goals in the second half.

‘‘I didn’t feel 1 was doing that well
because the team was playing so well.
I just happened to be the one who got
the last pass,” Taurassi remarked. She

Taurassi

also had an assist against Mary Wash-
ington.

Also playing well for the Generals
this week was senior Brooke Glenn,
who had 24 saves and only allowed
eight goals. “Our defense is playing
great, but it is not only out defenders.
Our entire team is playing great de-
fense. Mary Washington could hardly
get the ball into our end.”

Leading the Generals against Mary
Washington were juniors Mary Jo
Mahoney and Whitney Parker with
three goals each. Glenn had 12 saves.
Senior Ericka Snyder had three as-
sists.

On Thursday, W&L beat Colby
College 13-4. The Generals jumped
out to a 6-0 lead, en route to a 8-2
halftime edge. In the second half,
Glenn held Colby scoreless for the
first 24 minutes and made 12 saves.

Parker and Snyder led the Generals
with three goals each, while Mahoney
and Taurassi each added two.

The Generals improved to 4-1 in
the Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence——the only loss came at the hands
of Lynchburg College.

“The Lynchburg game was the best

thing that could have
happened to us,” said
Taurassi, “It was good
to see everyone so upset
about losing.”

Glenn echoed these
sentiments, ‘‘It was re-
ally a wake—up call for
us. This wasn’t our
team. We lost our
game.”

The women have
four games remaining,
including games against
Frostburg State, Tren-
ton State, Sweet Briar,
and Roanoke College.

For the Generals, the
future looks bright. “We
have some tough games
ahead of us, including
Roanoke [ranked 10th
in the nation], and Tren-

ton State [ranked first],’’ said Glenn.
Taurassi added, “We are always

looking at out next game, but we would

like to win ODACs and get abid to the

NCAA tournament.”

The women’s next game, and last home
game, is Apr. 1 versus Frostbug State.

their three matches, and the Garcia-Hartzell doubles
team swept their~three.

On Sunday, the Generals blewout Middlebury

College. Leading the Generals were Eggers
and freshman Shannon Bell, both of whom
blanked their opponents 6-0, 6-0. Garcia,
Blankinship, Hartzell and Foster also posted

Mary Washington posed the greatest challenge to
the Generals on Friday. The Generals escaped with
a 5-4 victory. Playing in the first spot, Garcia won
handily 6-2, 6-3. Blankinship also was victorious in

the second slot. She survived the second set and
blanked Mary Washington’s Jyoti Schlesinger in

President Elrod tours with Kl

BY I.P. FREELY
PHI STAFF WRITER

President Elrod sent a letter to the
Trustees last week informing them of
his leave of absence starting spring term
and lasting throughout 1997.

Details of the letter were leaked to
The Ring-tum Phi. In it, Elrod told the
trustees that he had to “follow his
dreams,” and went on to say, “this is an
opportunitythat few collegiate
presidents get. I think that it
will help the University’s ex-
posure.” This evidently in-
cludessubbingin for Kissbass
player Gene Simmons.

Elrod has been a long-time
friend of several Kiss mem-
bers. Inthemid-l970’saKiss
spokesperson said, “Our makeup and
outfits are inspired after those actually
worn by John Elrod.”

Over the years, Elrod has written
freelance songs forthe band. His credits
include “Lick it up,” “I Like it Loud,”
and the smash hit “Rock ‘n’ Roll All
Nite.”

“It was a shame he left the band, but
at his successes, we support him one

 

hundred percent.” said Kiss guitarist.
“He is a kick-a** bass player and a real
asset to the band.”

Elrod’s announcement came as a
major shock to the Trustees. “I respect
his decision,” Gerry Lenfest said. “His
reasons were solid and his motives were
clear. I think the University should
stand solidly behind President Elrod.”

Also leaving the University will be
David Howison, who signed on after
Elrod asked him to be a Kiss
roadie. ‘‘I’m excited,” said
Howison, “this is like all my
childhood dreams come
true.”

Many other professors
have stated they would like
to go on tour with Kiss as
well, but their classes do not
permit it.

“I would love to go out and groove
with Kiss,” Lloyd Dobyns of the jour-
nalism department said. “Unfortu-
nately, Ijust don’t have time with my
classes and my techno band’s rigorous
funk practice sessions.”

Elrod and Howison willjoin the band
in Richmond on Wednesday. Mimi
Elrod will join them in San Francisco.

Senior Steve Frame has given up hisjob search for
after graduation. Although Frame has been offered
management-track positions by several Fortune
500 companies, he has decided to persue a career
: as a guitarist with a strolling mariachi band.

I SpringTerm, Frame will intern at El Puerto Mexi-
I can Restaurant. “I’m really glad l’ll be able to spend
I [Spring Term] getting practical experience in my
I field,” Frame said. “El Puerto actually has been
. very supportive ofthe arts since its opening. For
g a while, they had a woman who would dance on
the bar during the break between lunch and
j dinner.”

Beverly’Lorig, director of the Career Develop-
ment and Placement Office, helped arrange Frame’s
internship. “This is another of our many success
 stories. We’re really quite proud of Steve. We’re
 still exploring options for after graduation, but
’ right now we’re thrilled with his internship. If
we can’t get anything solid by June, Steve isjust
going to go to Tiajuana and see what he can

find.” '
' Frame's musical career is a success story. He got
his start entertaining people during the Mr. W&L
contest in 1994. He has high hopes for the
mariachi band and hopes to eventually become
the most well known mariachi player in all the

  funky IIl1lSiC   world.
Easter Bunny captured by locals

Apparently, the Easter Bunny was making his Easter
rounds, stealing all of the children’s eggs in the areain order
to make a giant omelet when local hunters caught sight of
him.

“I wasout lookingfordeer to kill and decapitate forawall-
hanging, when I caught sight of his ugly yellow hide.”
Rockenheimer said. “He was standing with his back to me.
I think he was relieving himself.”

Rockenheimer went on to explain he quickly loaded
some tranquilizer darts into his rifle and opened ﬁre.

“When all my buddies heard me shooting, they all started
ﬁring too. We were lucky that they were shooting tranqs too
or that big Bunny would be full of holes instead of full of
dope,” Rockenheimer said.

The Easter Bunny was taken to the Lexington Police
Department where he was booked and thrown into the drunk
tank to sleep off the tranquilizers.

The most wanted criminal since Charles Manson was
captured thismomingat approximately 5:30 a.m. The Easter
Bunny, wanted in all 50 states, was shot 43 timesby local area
hunters’ tranquilizer guns.

“He went down like a 80 pound bag of manure,” Keith
R. Rockenheimer, a Lexington resident, said.

The Bunny, who has been sought after by the police, the
national guard and all fourdivisions of the armed forces, was
wanted for breaking and entering, kidnapping, libel, slander,
drunk in public, indecent exposure, petty larceny, bad taste,
terrible body odor and the murder of the Energizer Bunny,
who was found battery-less last Friday, his drum torn from
his mangy pink hide.

BY THE INSTIGATOR AND THE BALL BOY
Pm STAFF WRlTERS

Freshman Kevin MeManemiII, who in last week’s
Phi suggested fraternities “create new methods of
socially acceptable torture” for their pledges,is now
eating his words.

It seems the brothers of the house McManemin
pledged have taken him up on his offer. Last Friday,
McManemin was taken to Schenectady, New York’s
infamous red-light district.

Upon arrival, McManemin reports, he was forced
to drink horse semen. “It really is a lot like Pabst and
Natty Light,” McManemirI said. “ I was just making
that up when I wrote it in my column.”

McManemin was paddled, forced to deﬁne and
use the word “delineate” in a sentence, figure out the
meaning of life, change his socks and make passes
at inanimate objects.

McManemin was hit with a brick the size of a
ham, a ham the size of a brick, the BBC’s Mr. Bean
(actually, Mr. Bean was unavailable, but a very
good imitator stepped in) and a ham the size of Mr.
Bean.

While he was being pummeled, McManemin
was forced to chant the Greek alphabet, “Ohm,
shanti shanti,” “We are the knights who say NI!”
and “Hello Mudda/Hello Fadda/Here I am at/Camp
Grenada.”

When all of the torture and chanting was over,
the brothers and McManemin returned to Lexing-
ton, where McManemin was welcomed into the full
brotherhood and given a pack of gum and a coupon
book.

McManemin says of his experience in
Schenectady, “I never knew Schenectady really had
a red light district. Now that l’ve been there, I have
to say that with the right advertising, Schenectady
could give Amsterdam 21 run for its money.”

“It’s really good to be in a fraternity with a sense
of humor about initiation rituals,” McManemin
said, “but I wonder ifl shouldn’t have joined one of
those fraternities that just beats you for an hour.”

azer, Inc. has supplied W&L fra
ternities with a new toy for Hell
Week.

The PledgeTazer appeared at Wash-
ington and Lee last week. The inven-
tion, which promises to “outperform
any boring old paddle,” is designed to
give fraternity pledges a shock of elec-
tricity when it comes into contact with
a pledge posterior.

A spokesman for Tazer, Inc., ap-
peared at W&L last Thursday.

“Tazer, Inc., feels that the fra-
ternity system offers a large po-
tential for sales,” Pat
Youontheheadwitharock said. ‘‘It
is the belief of Tazer, Inc., that
the violent act of hazing and those
who participate in it can benefit
from the use of our product. We
are making every effort to extend
fraternity brothers our support.”

Commenting on the apparent popu-
larity of the product,
Youonthehead-
witharock said,
“Who would
want to use a
paddle when
they can fulfill
their sadistic
fantasies on
unsuspecting
boys with thou-
sands of watts of
Tazer Power?”

“On behalf of the
Interfraternity Council,
I would like to extend our
thanks to Tazer, Inc.,” IFC
President Anthony
Mazzarelli said. “We feel that
thisisjustthe sortofkickinthe
pantsthe fraternity system needs,
no pun intended.”

Mazzarelli acknowledges that
along with new pleasures,

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   

 

PledgeTazer offers new responsibili-
ties.

“We are tightening our restric-
tions on fraternities to avoid abuse
of the PledgeTazer,” Mazzarelli
said. “However, we recognize that

we can’t watch fraternities all
the time, so brothers will basi-
cally be able to do whatever
they want most of the time, no
matter how many rules we
make.”
“Ithinkthewholething’sabsurd,”
Professor Holt Merchant, Professor
of History,said. “Students already
cometo my classes drunk. Now
they’re going to be armed, too.
In my personal opinion, it’s
not good to combine alcohol
and handheld weapons.”
The popularity ofthe
device on campus
seems to have carried
over to the commu-
nity. The Lexington Police

llls Hell Week

Department, realizing the
PledgeTazer’s usefulness, has placed
an order with Tazer, Inc.

“Wc’re not exactly sure what we’ll
use them for,” Officer B.
Eatyouwithmynightstick said. “But
we’re getting sort oftired ofourthree-
wheeled parking enforcement thing,
and we need something new to play
with.”

Letters from concerned parents of
freshmen have begun to arrive in
Washington Hall.

“Naturally, parents are concerned
that their children are going to be
harmed as a result of the use of this
device,” President Elrod said. “And
their concerns arejustified. Freshmen
get hurt here.”

Fora while, at least, the PledgeTazer
will be prevalent on campus.

“ljust love this thing,”Joe Hardon,
a brother at a W&L fraternity, said.
“Sometimes I even use it on myself.
It’s hard as hell to paint, though.”

Washington and Lee commu-
nity, rid the university of one
of its greatest blights. The
day was a cause for campus-
wide celebration.

“We’ve been planning this
for months,” President “John
John” Elrod said. Afterafare-
well speech, in which Elrod
promised a more aesthetically
pleasing future, a small ther-
monuclear warhead was deto-
nated in sub level three of the
library, leveling the building
and drawing applause from
the throng of people who had
come to see the building’s
demise. The event was fol-
lowed by a concert featuring
Elrod’s latest band, Kiss.
(Please see the News page for
more information.)

Leyburn Library will be
replaced with a new structure
which will embody some of

V the administration’s plans for
 future building projects. The
" new “hyper—library,” as it is
3 already being called by many
‘on campus, will include: a

parking garage, a student
union, a movie theater, an ice
skating rink, four sorority
houses, a GNC supercenter
and a library.

The new hyper-library is
being funded by a donation
left to the university by a
wealthy Texan alum.

“Thank God for Texas,”
Elrod said. “Because of the
alum’s donation, we won’t
have to worry about what to
name the hyper-library, un-
like that [expletive] science
building.”

University administration
has begun to work with the
architect in charge of design-
ing the new building to en-
sure that Leyburn Library’s
replacement will fit in with
the rest of campus.

“Columns: it has to have
lots and lots of columns,”
Elrod said.

Before it was destroyed,
certain essentials were re-
moved from Leyburn Library
and retained sothat they could
beinstalledinthe newlibrary.

“We kept those boss or-
ange chairs,” Dick Grefe, Se-
nior Reference Librarian,
said. “The students seem to
love those. We also kept all
our microfiche terminals be-
cause they remind me of in-
struments I see on ‘Star
Trek.”’

Nice rod, Dick:

for sake of esthetics

Dick Grefe, Senior Reference Librarian, stands triumphantly over the
remains of Leyburn Library. The builing's demise was celebrated by all, as
was Grefe’s Viking costume, which he referred to fondly as “Wanda.”

The new hyper-library will
be more geared toward the
student and their needs.

“All of the fishbowls will
be outfitted with condom
machines and sliding covers
for the windows on the doors
so that students will better be
ableto,um,study,”Grefesaid.
“Also, we will install special
red light phones linked di-
rectly to professors’ offices to
allow students to call and
plead for extensions right

from the library.”

Grefe promises that the
new library will not stand
tallcrthanthestatueofGeorge
Washington.

“We’ve eliminatedalotof
need for space by throwing
away books and things that
no one ever uses,” Grefe said.
“We got rid ofall our texts on
British naval poetry. I never
read that crap: I don’t know
why anyone else would.”

Grefe does not seem too

concerned about the loss of
one ofthe campus’ buildings.

“Thewholethingwasslip-
ping into the Dell anyway,”
Grefe said. “Besides, it was
ugly. Between you and me, I
hear that the Woods Creek
Apartments will be the next
to go.”

The new library should be
completed some time after
you graduate, because that’s
the way these things always
work.

’ PHI DANGER SPECIALIST

Students who go to the front lawn
to “study” while they soak up the sun
will find some old friends waiting for
them.

The Earth Mounds, following their
interstellar travel to the far reaches of
outer space, have returned to campus
and reseated themselves in front of
Tucker Hall. Their visit has sparked
interest both on campus and in the
scientific community.

Havingleft without explainingthe
purpose for their trip, the Earth
Mounds claim they had a good rea-
son to go.

“We needed dates for FD,” Head
Earth Mound said. “Sure, there are
plenty of attractive, intelligent, fun
female Earth Mounds around here,
but let’s just say there are certain
‘advantages’ to taking an Earth
Mound from offcampus, ifyou know
what I mean.

“Besides, if the female Earth
Mounds want dates, they can find
plenty of physically-fit, well—man-
nered Earth Mounds over at Earth
Mound Military Institute who will
probably behave far more like gentle-
men than we ever would,” Head Earth
Mound said.

Unfortunately, the Earth Mounds
were detained in their travels, return-
ing too late to attend FD.

“We stopped at a Chinese restau-
rant outside of Sector 7,” Head Earth
Mound said. “They serve drinks to
just about anyone there. We would
have came back in time for FD, but

by the time I had my third ‘Volcano,’
I didn’t even know where I was.”

An official NASA spokesman, vis-
iting the campus to observe the be-
havior of the Earth Mounds, com-
mented on the significance of the
Earth Mounds’ return.

“What’s really incredible is that
they all returned to exactly the same
place,” Guy Withallyourtaxes said.
“These Earth Mounds had as much of
a: chance of returning to the same
exact spots from which they left as
Bob Dole had of getting elected,
which was not a very good chance at
all.”

Representing the administration
of Washington and Lee University,
President John Elrod expressed his
pleasure over the return of the Earth
Mounds.

“I am always glad when mem-
bers of another culture come to
our fine university,” Elrod said.
“I know the student body here is
about as culturally diverse as the
faculty.”

The Earth Mounds are pleased
with the interest they have gener-
ated.

“We’re hoping that they’ll
name the new science building
after us,” Head Earth Mound said.
“I think ‘The Big Earth Mound’
vslould make a lovely name for a
building.”

Unfortunately, the Earth
Mounds’ visit will not last for
long.

“We’ll have to leave by the end
of the semester,” the Earth
Mounds explained. “We won’t

have anything to eat then because
Food Services will make our Food
Debitaccountsdisappearlike Tom
Arnold’s career, never to be seen
again.”

At least some people on cam-

 wxouwels return Frowx outer space

pus will be happy to see them go.

“If they don’t leave soon, I’m
going to have to tow them all,”
Baner said. “And right after that,
I’m going to go get a real hair-
cut.”

Frolernilg house mother
arrested for public nudilg

BY DIONNE WARWICK
PHI PSYCHIC CORRESPONDENT

Delta Tau Chi’s housemother Emerald Flame displayed her true
talents to the brothers Friday night. Known as the “most limber” house-
mother on campus, Flame proved her talents true and upheld her reputation.

When Washington and Lee security entered the basement of DTC
hoping to find illegal pledge hazing, they instead found Flame involved
in another form of fraternal bonding.

“She was involved in questionable acts. She has been known to have
a history of such activity” was all that Director of Security Mike Young
would say. ’

Flame has been arrested previously for indecent exposure after frolick-
ing nude on the front lawn of W&L. “She really added to the picturesque
landscaping,” Senior Richard Nutz said.

“I like to sunbathe nude, and those nasty bathing suit line are really
annoying,” Flame said when asked why she was clothed in such a fashion.

“Emerald is a very talented woman and does a lot for the fraternity,”
President John W. Elrod said when asked why she was kept on after her arrest.

Flame was escorted to Lexington City Jail where she is under the
personal custody of Police Chief W. F. Smith. She has not been charged.

Rita Fitz, a neighbor of the fraternity house, claims that Flame comes
and goes at rather strange times and “much too frequently in my opinion.”
Other neighbors state that Flame is known to frequent one house more
than any other— that of Police Chief Smith.

Before moving to Lexington, Flame lived in Amsterdam and Las
Vegas where she says she was finishing her education.

“Everyone here in Lexington is so nice to me,” Flame said, “My boys
are the best.”

Questions have arisen as to whether Flame will keep her job. “She is
a very caring housemother, and she’s hot,” Elrod said.

Flame has been in counseling for repressed sexuality and states that she
feels that she is getting better.

“I have so much support from the boys,” Flame said, “They want to see
me get better and are willing to help in any way that they can.”

Smith refused to comment saying that he felt that he did not know
enough about the situation. Flame feels she will receive the best treatment
while in Smith’s care.

The brothers of DTC feel that Flame is the best housemother they have
ever had.

“She won’t let us want for anything,” Tim said, “She will bend over
backwards to make us happy.”

W&L campus switches
from Pepsi to Coke

BY THE CANADIAN PIRATE
PHI “EH” EXPERT

The event that's been more greatly anticipated than the return of
"Hollywood" Hulk Hogan has finally arrived——Washington and Lee
University has moved into the twentieth century by switching to Coca-
Cola.

Products bearing the Coca-Cola trademark will be available across
campus startingtoday. Students will no longer have to brave the dangerous
path which leads to the back ofthe science building construction site, or the
far more dangerous path which leads to Reid Hall to ﬁnd their beverage of
choice.

Taking a break from his busy touring schedule with the hit rock group
KISS, President "John John" Elrod commented on the University's deci-
sion.

"Why do you think we have so many deans, anyway?" Elrod said. "We
get paid to make this sort of command decision."

Responding to opposition to the change, Elrod Claimed that the two
beverages are very much alike and that fans ofone beverage should at least
sample the othe '.

"Coke and Pzpsi are like Lexington cousins," Elrod said. "Only their
mamas can tell them apart."

Departmentsstandardize registration process

BY ANNA PARRIs
PHI STAFF WRITER

Long lines. Camp—outs. Two
things that sound bearable in antici-
pations of concert tickets, but detest-
able in the midst of registration. Af-
ter years of sleep—overs in Newcomb
Hall, picnics outside the registar’s
office and the cries ofangry and tired
students, the Washington and Lee
Registar has made efforts to standard-
ize the registration process. On-line
registration may not be too far behind.

“I have encouraged the depart-
ments to stick with the new schedule
for departmental permission and reg-
istration,” University Registar Scott

Dittman said.

Dittman has received several com-
plaints that students obtain permission
for classes before the specified time.
Dittman believes that encouraging
standardization will help simplify the
registration process. “It drives the pro-
fessors crazy and it drives the students
crazy the way it is now.”

“I think that the standardization is
essential to end the never-ending
query of ‘How do I get into this
class,’” freshman Romy Rosenbaum
said.

But Dittman does not think that it
will get rid of the lines altogether.
“Sometimes I think that waiting on
lines is a social thing for students,”

Dittman said. “W&L students don’t
wait on line for concert tickets or
anything like that, so maybe they
say, ‘We have to wait in line for
something.’”

Dittman has also seriously con-
sidered registration methods used at
other universities. In the past sev-
eral years, students at schools in-
cluding the University of Richmond
and the George Washington Univer-
sity register by phone. This system
would create more problems than it
is worth, Dittman said.

“I haven’t been very impressed
with the phone registration
method,” said Dittman. “Students

White Book changes considered

BY KATHRYN MAYURNIK
PHI NEws EDITOR

If there were ever any gray area
about honor violations involving the
use of fake IDs outside Rockbridge
County, the gray area has just disap-
peared.

At the behest of the White Book
Review Committee, a group of stu-
dents appointed to review the White
Book every three years, the Executive
Committee has made some revisions,
one concerning the implications of us-
ing fake identifications.

As of now, the White Book states
that a student is accountable under the
Honor System when in Rockbridge
County or when he or she is visible as
W&L student. That has now changed.

The new clause reads that W&L
students must conduct themselves
honorably at all times, whether they
are in Lexington, New York or any
other place. This would include the

use of fake IDs among other infrac-
tions ofthe Honor System.

“It takes offthe geographical limi-
tations on honorable behavior,” E.C.
President Sandy Hooper said. “The
Honor System should follow students
wherever they go.”

The White Book Review Com-
mittee also issued surveys to obtain
feedback from students. “Many stu-
dents felt that professors should be ac-
countable under the honor code,”
Hooper said. The professors are pres-
ently accountable to the dean, not the
E.C. This policy is not going to
change, Hooper said, but certain
wording in the White Book has been
changed to address student concerns.

“We added a clause stating that
students expect all members of the
W&L community are to embody the
ideals of the honor system,” Hooper
said, “This would include everyone
from professors to buildings and
grounds people, although it doesn‘t

mean that they are accountable un-
der the honor system.”

The Committee also proposed that
the Advocate Pool, the group of law
students who provide counsel to
honor violation defendants, should
be expanded and opened to under-
graduates. The Committee proposed
that the Advocate Pool should con-
duct honor investigations. Members
ofthe Committee felt that this would
make the hearings more fair and re-
move any bias the E.C. investigators
might hold.

“We felt that this would get more
students to participate in the Honor
System," Committee Chairman
Adam Branson said. “It would also
foster a greater sense of trust of the
E.C. Some people feel that the E.C.
is the judge, jury and executioner,
and expanding the Advocate P001 to
investigation would make the E.C. as

push too many buttons, and listen
to busy signals. The process could
take forever.”

Dittman wants to move toward
intemet registration, but the estimated
cost of $35,000 is too expensive for
the University at this time. “There is
also the issue of students being able
to choose particular sections of classes
with the intemet method,” Dittman
said. “Some professors are not too
happy about that idea.”

However, W&L has kept with the
internet trend, as many students dis-
covered late in winter term when they
found that they were able to obtain
their schedules from the W&L
homepage.

SJC Blue Book:
how the whole
thing happened

BY C.E. MILLER
PHI EXECUTIVE EDITOR

The rules have changed. After a
year of ideas, revisions, opposition
and unwavering faculty support, the
Student Conduct Committee (SCC)
replaced itself with the Student Judi-
cial Council (SJC).

Last Spring term, the recently ap-
pointed Chairman of the SCC Robert
Covington and Secretary Paul Saboe
approached Dean of Students David
L. Howison about altering the SCC to
make it more effective.

The SCC spent much of the ‘96
spring term creating the Blue Book
which outlined the policies and pro-
cedures of the SJC. The initial draft
resulted in a student conduct system
that strongly resembled the Honor
System.

The Blue Book outlined proce-
dures and instituted elections. It was
modeled after the White Book, which
outlines procedures and policies of the
Honor System. The new similarities
included posting convictions of mis-
conduct, a two-tier trial system, and
the right to appeal

“They had this
idea to strengthen
the (SCC) system
by electing mem-
bers,” Howison
said. “Previously
the Executive Com-
mittee appointed
the chair and the
secretary while the
elected president
and vice president

“I don't think (the
SCC) did as much as
they could have to
inform students
about the changes
taking place. ”

- Sophomore
Patrick McCormack

to the University
Board of Appeals.

“(The SAC)
took the issue up
during the fall and
into winter term,”
Howison said. “We
held an open forum
for student reaction
in October.”

It was at this
open forum that

for each class
served on the com-
mittee.”

According to Paul Saboe, the SCC
required time that many members
could not give because of obligations
to their class offices.

Saboe and Covington felt that if the
student body elected members to the
SCC, then the students would have
more control over who enforced pun-
ishments and SCC members would
have the time to serve on the commit-
tee.

Dean Howison supported this ini-
tiative and suggested the SCC create
a draft proposal to submit to the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee (SAC) for
approval. Students, faculty and ad-
ministration serve on SAC which re-
ports directly to the faculty. Any pro-
posed changes to the regulation of stu-
dent conduct must be approved by the
SAC and the faculty.

opposition to the
proposal ﬁrst surfaced. Fewer than 10
students attended the forum and of
those only Sophomore Patrick
McCormack took a keer interest in
the proposed changes.

“I ﬁrst heard about the SJC in The
Ring-tum Phi,” McCormack said. “I
went out and I picked up a copy of
the Blue Book.”

McCormack presented his sugges-
tions at the open forum, several of
which were adopted into the revised
edition ofthe Blue Book.

The revised Blue Book mandated
automatic penalties for seven infrac-
tions of misconduct, introduced
victim’s rights, shortened the appeal
process, limited the role of the SJC
chair in investigations and changed
the amendment procedure.

Lexington 911 system online

BY KATHRYN MAYURNIK
PHI NEws EDITOR

The city of Lexington leaps into the
21st century with the introduction of
the enhanced 91 1 emergency system,
meeting some opposition from local
residents and some Washington and
Lee staff members.

Lexington recently installed an en-
hanced system that allows the dis-
patcher to see the caller’s phone num-
ber, name and address on a computer
screen. Rockbridge Country imple-
mented the service over a year ago.

This mapping system might have
required some residents living on the
outskirts of the Lexington city limits
to change their house number. The
subdivisions in question include Ce-
dar Grove, Maury Cliffs and the
Birdfield neighborhood.

“To make the mapping system
more effective, every twenty feet in
the county has to have a number,”
County Board of Supervisors mem-
ber Nanalou Sauder said. “Since
there are so many vacant spaces out
in the county, a lot ofthese spaces
would have numbers. in the event

that someone would build on them
someday. For people that already
have city style codes, this would mean
that their house numbers would end
up being changed.”

Members ofthe Birdfield neigh-
borhood submitted a petition to the
County Board of Supervisors pro-
testing the changes. Signers in-
clude Washington and Lee Associ-
ate Treasurers Stephen McAllister
and John Cuny. Aquatic Director
Page Remillard also lives in the
neighborhood.

“It’s a big inconvenience to
change all of your magazines and
bills,” Cuny said. “Everyone would
also have to change their mail-
boxes.”

The County Board of Supervi-
sors told the residents that they will
listen to the people if 80% signed
the petition.

“About 90-95% ofthe people in
our neighborhood have signed it,”
Cuny said. “I think that we’ve met
our requirement.”

And their efforts paid off.
“When we were planning it out, we
didn’t realize how much it would

affect those residents,” Sauder said.
“Since they met the requirement,
they get to keep their house num-
bers.”

Lexington has finally arrived to
enhanced 911 after continual plan-
ning and obstacles since the l980’s.

Obstacles included the Perry,
Fla. vendor 91 1 Systems’ failure to
live up to its contractual obliga-
tions. A new vendor, Vision Soft-
ware, was hired after both Lexing-
ton and Rockbridge juridictions
voided their contract with 91 1 Sys-
tems.

Total costs of Lexington’s en-
hanced 91 lsystem amount to over
$100,000. Residents have been
paying a 911 tax since 1993.

Anticipated improvements to
both the Lexington
Rockbridge County systems in-
clude a consolidated dispatch cen-
ter.

‘‘It would save a lot oftime for
the rescue squads to get to the
callers,” Sauder said. “I look for-
ward to the consolidated effort.”

Additional reporting done by
Trevor Reed.

Saving Technology Comes to Lexington

As of last month, Lexington residents dialing 911 for emergencies are
answered by dispatchers who can view the caller's exact location,
address and name through an advanced computer mapping system. A
proposed consolidated dispatch center between Lexington and
Rockbridge County will speed the assistance of ﬁre, police and rescue
squads. Lexington ﬁnally welcomes the 911 system after the many
obstacles, including a consultant that failed to live up to his end of the
contract, that have impeded its installation since the l980’s have ﬁnally

been overcome.

Retraction

Retraction to “Law students sentenced” 3/31/97:

In the last issue of The Ring-tum Phi, a news article incorrectly stated that
the SCC “found two first year law students guilty of drunken belligerence
after entering an undergraduate’s Woods Creek apartment without pennis-
sion.”

While the SCC sentenced four law students students for activities that
occurred the same night, the students were involved in separate incidents,
not related to the break-in. The Phi_thanks SCC member Mary Mahoney for

bringing this mistake to our attention.

law students and a well-prepared
McCormack.

“I hadn’t heard about the changes
that were made,” McConnack said,
“and I don’t think the (SCC) did as
much as they could have to inform
students about the changes taking
place.”

Saboe felt that the SCC used its
limited resources effectively. During
the year the SCC created a webpage
that provided the full text of the re-
vised Blue Book, placed copies of the
Blue Book in the library and sent let-
ters to both student newspapers. Ad-
ditionally the newspapers covered the
revisions and open forums. Dean
Howison felt that the nature of the
system is such that when things are
going well there is not much inter-
est.

“When we were discussing the
Blue Book, there weren’t any real is-
sues that galvanized student atten-
tion,” Howison said, “and that is why
the open forum attendance was fairly
modest.”

At the second open forum
McCormack’s suggestions and con-
cerns about the Blue Book were met
with hostility by several members of

the SCC.
Saboe supported several of

McCormack’s revisions and felt that
SAC should consider these before
presenting the Blue Book to the fac-
ulty. Saboe and McCormack drafted
a letter that urged the amendment pro-
cedure was changed.

“I know that several members of
the SCC really didn’t like my perfor-
mance at that second open forum,”
McCormack said, “and few people
were glad that 1 took an avid interest
in it.”

Although McCormack pledged to
stop the faculty from passing the Blue
Book in its current state, the faculty
unanimously approved it in March.
Elections for SJC secretary, chairman
and justices were held in late'March.

McCormack decided to try to re-
form the SJC from the inside by run-
ning for SJC secretary. He lost that
election to Greta Richter, who served
on SCC for two years and was active
in the changes made to the SCC.

“I was on the SCC freshman and
sophomore years,” Richter said, “and
I really liked being on it. I ran because
I knew I could do a greatjob.”

Far from resigned, McCormack
entered the race for Junior class jus-
tice. “So many people say our elec-
tions don’t deal with issues, just per-
sonality and popularity,” McConnack
said, “but I made my race about is-
sues. I ran on a refonn platform be-
cause changes need to be made.”

McCormack was elected in a run-

off election by the narrow margin of
108-101.

“I think it is going to be a little hard
working with some of the members
who are returning from the SCC.”
McConnack said. “I know that they
were pretty much uniformly proud of
what they were doing...they are not
terribly eager to see it reformed
again.”

McConnack intends to approach
the refonn in three general areas. His
first goal is to change the way in
which students brought up on miscon-
duct charges are represented.

Currently a member of the SJC in-
vestigates and gathers evidence.
McCormack sees this as a prejudiced
system because the justice that pre-
sents evidence against the accused
also votes on whether or not miscon-
duct occurred. McConnack feels that
the pool of advocates that currently
exists for Honor System investiga-
tions should also be used for SJC in-
vestigations.

The second area McCormack is
looking to refonn is the statute of limi-
tations. The Blue Book allows stu-
dents 12 weeks to ﬁle a complaint
with the SJC. According to
McCormack this is ﬂawed because in
the cases that involve vandalism, the
perpetrator is often not identiﬁed right
away. He feels that a statute of limi-
tations is not necessary.

The third area of refonn concerns
jurisdiction. Currently a student can
be punished by a dorm counselor or
the lnterfratemity Council and then

if the incident is reported to the SJC
it will also punish the offender.

The SAC removed a line in the
Blue Book that said “mitigating cir-
cumstances would permit a lesser
penalty to be applied than the current

automatic penalties.” They changed it
180 destances would allow a harsher
punishment to be applied.”

“I know that people who have been
elected are not going to do this,”
McCormack said, “but the theoretical
extreme is that it could become a ha-
rassing kind of organization where an
accused person could suffer two or
three rounds of these punitive mea-
sures.”

Howison respects McCorrnack’s
diligence in this matter. “If he remem-
bers that the SJC is not a political
body, then I think he’ll be an excel-
lent member of the SJC. It is ajudi-
cial body and certainly if the body as
a whole sees certain procedures as
they work need to be refined they can
do that. However, it would be mis-

guided to start on the premise that we
are going to change this body,” he
said.

Dean Howison’s personal goal is
to have all conduct, outside of the
Honor System, handled by the SJC.
Currently sexual misconduct and haz-
ing are handled by outside commit-
tees.

McCormack has said that although
the Blue Book is broad enough to
adapt such changes in five or six
years, it hinders the current system.

The election of thejudges, accord-
ing to Howison, was the most impor-
tant aspect of implementing the new
system.

“I know that every year from now
the positions on SJC will become
more competitive . . . especially as it

becomes more respected in the eyes
of the students,” he said. ‘F

SJC Secretary Greta Richter also
feels that these changes will create
more respect among the student body
for the SJC. q

“We need to focus on educatirlg
the incoming freshman class. If we
can create the kind of impression the
Honor System does now we will be
successful in gaining the respect we
need,” she said.

Howison agrees that the orienta-
tion of the next freshmen class is vi-
tal. He said it will help in maintain-
ing student interest in the SJC. I.

Even though the Blue Book goes
into effect the first day of spring term,
the SJC has failed to make copies of -
it readily available. According to
members of the SJC and former SGC
copies have not been distributed be-
cause there are no provisions for this
in the budget. The webpage is avail-
able on the W&L homepage.

According to the Blue Book, the
SJC “believes that Gen. Robert E.
Lee’s ideal of honorable behavior is
a standard that must be upheld. Stu-
dents are bound to this standard jtlsf
as they are bound to the Honor Sys- 
tern.”

The SCC changed the system of
conduct to create a parallel systemiof '
punishment for misconduct.

“For far too long students have
treated any behavior outside of lying,
cheating, or stealing as a joke,” Saboe
said. “By changing the rules and cVre- .
ating the SJC we have developed a
program that can effectively deal with
misconduct.”

Lexington prepares for first

W&life

f it weren’t for two Frenchmen who believed smoke had magical proper-
Ities, 14 seven-story—tall giants wouldn’t be launching from Virginia Mili-
tary Institute’s Parade Ground this summer.

In Paris, 1783, two brothers, Joseph and Etienne Montgolfier, were watch-
ing their ﬁreplace and noticed that bits of paper would ﬂy up the chimney.
They concluded smoke had some magic property to make things ﬂy. Eleven
years later, the brothers began the age of aviation by sending a duck, a rooster
and a sheep into the air. The trio was the ﬁrst hot air balloon passengers.

Over Independence Day weekend, residents of the Shenandoah Valley will
have the opportunity to experience the same thrill of flight. Sunrise Rotary
Club is organizing Lexington’s ﬁrst annual Maury River Fourth of July Bal-
loon Rally. There will be ﬁve launches from the parade grounds and plenty of
opportunities for visitors to take a ride in a balloon or, for the less adventur-
ous, keep their feet on the ground and learn more about the sport from balloon
enthusiasts. In addition, 50-60 volunteers will have the unique experience of
actually working with the aircrafts.

“I’m sure many people have never been near a hot air balloon before,”
Sunrise Rotary Club member Don Miller said. ‘‘It will give people exposure
to something they usually aren’t exposed to.”

There will be a launch at 6 a.m. on July 3, 4 and 5;
and 6 p.m. on July 3 and 4. Saturday night’s launch
will precede the annual ﬁreworks display. Tickets
for rides are being rafﬂed off by area Rotary Clubs
and non-proﬁt organizations. For visitors who want

to sample the experience, the balloons will be teth-
ered on Saturday morning. Lexington resident and bal-

loon enthusiast Marion Lunnemann is also taking reservations for hour-long bal-

 

“This is a chance for anyone who is interested in taking a hot air balloon
ride but who has never had an opportunity,” Lunnemann said. Lunnemann,
who has been ﬂying for nine years, says that ballooning is an activity you
have to experience to understand. “It’s hard to describe,” she said. “You just
see so much and sense so much; it’s unbelievable.”

Since the balloon moves with the wind, there is no sensation of movement
unless you look at the landscape. The air is unusually quiet, and people on the
ground can hear you speaking in a nonnal tone.

While all the balloons will launch from the VMI parade ground, landing
locations will be much more random. Throughout the weekend, the 70-to-
100-feet-tall balloons will be descending upon the Shenandoah valley coun-
tryside. “We’ll watch out for livestock,” said Lunnemann, who added that
farmers usually enjoy their unexpected guests.

Miller has wanted to bring hot air balloons to the annual Fourth of July
festivities for a long time, but it wasn’t until he met Lunnemann at the bank

 

APRIL 28, 1997

if she wanted to help organize a balloon rally. Lunnemann explained the
success of the partnership: “The Rotary Club had the business contacts andﬁ
had the friends with balloons.”

Lunnemann was a contract computer programmer in New York until she
was in an auto accident ten years ago. While recovering from her near-fatal
injuries, Lunnemann said, she realized what she really wanted to do in life,
which was to become a hot air balloon pilot. “If you really want to do some!
thing, you’ll ﬁnd a way to do it,” she said.

Lunnemann earned her license and bought her ﬁrst balloon. A year and a
half ago, Lunnemann and her husband moved to Lexington because she thought
it would be “a pretty place to ﬂy in.”

After their conversation at the bank, Lunnemann and Miller sent out 35' A
invitations to hot air balloon enthusiasts. So far, 14 balloons are registered for :
the event, including a bowling ball balloon from Iowa. The money the Rotary .

Club raises from the event will be used to provide dental care to low-income

elementary school students, Miller said. ,,
The rally still needs more volunteers to make the event a success. Mille

invites W&L students staying in-town over the summer to consider getting

involved. Training sessions are being held locally in which volunteers learn '

how to help unpack, inflate, launch, recover, delft and pack balloons. Volun-

teers are asked to attend three training sessions, the remaining ofwhich will bf ,

held the first weekend in May and the first two weekends in June. Miller
hopes all volunteers will eventually be able to get a free balloon ride.

To make reservations for a ride, call Marion Lunnemann, 261-9524. To
join a volunteer ground crew, call Matthew Paxton, 463-9810. I

New Italian restaurant doesn’t rank up to competition

It was Wednesday night, and our friend Tim
was visiting us from out oftown, so we decided
to investigate the new Italian restaurant, Franco’s.

We arrived shortly after 6:30, expecting a
slow crowd on an off-night, but the restaurant
was noisy and packed. Not making reservations
ahead of time was a mistake, but the staff man-
aged nevertheless to seat us in a timely manner.

After a considerable wait, the hostess asked
the owner who our waitress was; he located her,
and we ﬁnally received menus and drinks. The menu
presented a large selection of intriguing dishes, but
lacked some of the “traditional favorites.”

To drink, Tim chose iced tea, while we opted
for the house wines - red for Doug, white for
Robin. The iced tea was
cloudy and didn't meet our
Southern friend’s standards.
Although we aren't wine con-
noisseurs, we found our wines
harsh with a sharp after taste.

While waiting for our sal-
ads, we ate the garlic bread.
The entire basket. The bread
had a nice ﬂavor, but soon developed a chewy
consistency which suggested microwave prepa-
ration. But at the bottom of the basket, we found
a plain roll -— no garlic —— which Tim and Doug
shared and proclaimed rather tasty.

The salads finally arrived; Tim complained
that his dressing had arrived in a rather awk-
wardly-large bowl. We requested oil and vin-
egar, but were initially served Creamy Italian
by mistake. We then waited several minutes
while our waitress chased down one of the rare
sets of oil and vinegar bottles before we were
able to dress our salads "

   
 
 
  

“l+‘iir this kind of
Italian dining, II
Palazzo is still
the local Champ.”

~ and begin eating. The highly-popular oil-and-

vinegar set was quickly removed from our table,
although the salad plates remained until well
after our entrees had arrived, at which time Doug
took the initiative and moved the soiled dishes
to a nearby table.

We chose two of the more expensive entrees,
hoping that we would get our money’s worth.
Robin chose the Shrimp Ionio while Doug and
Tim both ordered the Beef Boscaiola. Both of
these entrees included a side of spaghetti.

The Shrimp was the more aesthetically pleas-
ing ofthe two dishes, but the Beefwas the more
palatable and came in a larger serving. Even
this larger portion, however, left Tim hungry. As
for the spaghetti, it seemed devoid
of taste and poorly presented.

On the whole, we found the
food to be grossly overpriced for
the portions we received, and the
dishes unpleasantly ﬂavored and
seasoned. Cooking is an art; it
would have been nice ifthe chef
had done something more cre-
ative with the canvas.

In all fairness the other restaurant patrons
seemed to be enjoying their meals with fewer

problems than we experienced. Franco’s has .

some definite potential, but with the Italian
competition that Lexington has to offer and
the handicap of poor location, we feel they
really need to do something distinguish them-
selves further. Except for our waitress, the
staff seemed conscientious and eager to
please; insufﬁcient numbers caused all their
efforts to fail.

For this kind of Italian dining, Il Palazzo is
still the local champ, but it would be nice to see
Franco’s correct some of its problems and add
variety to the Lexington dining options.
If you have lots of time and are in the
mood for something new, then Franco's
is worth a try. We hope you have a bet-
ter experience than we did.

Lunnemann, who describes herself as a “very friendly person,” started tell-
ing Miller about her ballooning hobby while waiting in line, and Miller asked

Jumping around. Piano diving.
Stool-throwing. These are some of the
outrageous stunts with which Ben
Folds Five will entertain the audience
at the concert Friday in the Pavilion.

The Chapel Hill, N.C.,-based band
first came together in 1993 and re-
leased a self-titled album introducing
the guitar—less lineup of the band. Ben
Folds plays piano and sings lead vo-
cals. Darren Jessee plays drums and
Robert Sledge plays bass.

Their ﬁrst album combined this in-
strumentation with Folds’ “highly per-
sonal and immensely catchy songs,”
according to the band’s homepage
(http: //www. epiccenter . com/
EpicCenter/Benfoldsite/).
“We all agreed the songs would rock
much better without guitars,” Folds
said, “so we just went with it.”

The Rolling Stone, in an album re-
view, calls Ben Folds Five a “truly for-
midable talent, brimming over with
melodic gifts, efficacious verbal
command and protean musical in-
stincts.”

The band’s latest album, “Whatever
and Ever Amen,” was released Feb. 18,
1997. “There are reminders through-
out this record that we’re not playing it
safe,” Folds said regarding the album.
“We didn’t want to pin ourselves down
to one sound, or to be as predictable or

Ben Folds Five seems to find it-

effects
‘BY SARAH MEI.DRuM
PHI STAFF WRITER

So, planning to relax this evening while
you study? If you reach for alcohol, you
Iiarm the learning process, according to re-
search done by Dr. Scott Swartzwelder of
Duke University.

Swartzwelder’s research centers on how
gtlcohol affects learning and memory, es-
pecially new memories. He became
interested in this subject through
earlier research showing that alco-
hol speciﬁcally affects the receptors
‘fn the brain that are critical in
memory storage.

“I started having kids,” Swartzwelder
explains. He knew that high school and
college students consume alcohol in large
quantities. Swartzwelder found that young
brains have a different balance of recep-
tors than adult brains, but discovered that
few people have studied how alcohol af-
ﬁects young brains.

Through tests on rats, whose hippoc-

of aflcohol and oher drugs

ampi are similar to those in humans,
Swartzwelder learned that alcohol impairs
memory systems in young brains. As few
as two drinks can inhibit neurotransmitters
important to the storage of new informa-
tion in the brain. .
Ifthe effects are the same in humans as in
rats, even for a highly intelligent student who
' studies often, the use of alco-
hol limits the amount ofin-
formation that person will

   

   

be able to retain.

When asked to explain why some stu-
dents believe they study better while drink-
ing, he replies that, “Someone could feel
more comfortable studying or taking a test
while drinking because alcohol does reduce
feelings of anxiety.”

He adds, however, that the “negative
effects of alcohol on memory formation
will far outweigh the positive ones on anxi-
ety as far as studying is concerned.” Stu-
dents who believe they do better aca-
demically are most likely fooling them-
selves, he says.

Lifestyle Information for Everyone,

cuss his research on alcohol and how it
affects learning and memory. Last fall,

prize to LIFE for new initiatives
in peer health education.

SOMETHING YOU WANT TO BRACI ABOUT?
SHOW YOUR CLASS SPIRIT, WRITE FOR NEWSLETTER

BY DAVID BALSLEY
PH9 EDITORIAL EDITOR

ave you accomplished something

special this year at Washington and

Lee University? Are you a sopho-
rmonfe? If so, the Sophomore Leadership Coun-
‘*cil would like to hear from you.

The Sophomore Class Newsletter, which is
eing assembled by the SLC, will showcase the
chievements of the Class of ’99. The publica-
‘ion is intended to promote class unity, as well
s to help students appreciate the accomplish-

ents of fellow classmates.

Sophomores are invited to submit descrip-

ioqs of their own or their friends’ exciting

events from this year, summer plans and spe-
cial achievements. Sophomore Leadership
Council President Mandy Stallard described the
sort of response that the group hopes to receive.

“We really are looking for anything. If
someone was at the Olympics and identiﬁed
the bomber, someone had ajob at the zoo and
was bitten by a rhino, someone was selected
to be Clinton’s new Secretary of State but
turned it down, someone in baby chem acci-
dentally discovered the cure for cancer, we
want to know," Stallard said.

Stallard describes the response to the
Sophomore Class Newsletter as “pretty good.”

“Many people have responded to the study
abroad, etc. prompt,” Stallard said. “I am

hoping to receive many more responses from
all facets of our class.”

The SLC is unsure of when it will publish the
newsletter but plans to make it available to all class
members. Publishing costs will be funded by class
dues and the class treasury.

ubmissions to the Sophomore Class News

letter may be deposited in envelopes lo-
cated in the Co-op and library or e—mailed to
astal/ar@wl u. edu.

Brag about your friends by heaving their
accomplishments published, or brag about
yourself by submitting accounts of your
own achievements. Either way, you will
help to support class unity through the
Sophomore Class Newsletter.

  

‘The Saint’:

Not one thing or the other

‘Ir *of 4 stars; ﬂashy but confused

The pitch: “lt'll be like James Bond without a point.”

Bv ALEX CHRISTENSEN
PH1MovIE CRITIC

Phillip Noyce is one of those commercial
directors who directs exactly what he is given,
no more and no less. When he has good ac-
tors and a well-crafted script, he’ ll make a very
good film (“Patriot Games,” “Clear and
Present Danger”). When he has bad actors
and a bad script, he’ll make a very bad ﬁlm
(“Sliver”). With “The Saint,” he had good ac-
tors and a bad script, which makes for an in-
credibly uneven ﬁlm which has no idea what
direction to take.

“The Saint” is a detective named Simon
Templar. A pre—Bond Bond type in the novels
and stories of Leslie Charter, he was a suave,
brilliant detective who solved crime with a little
charm and luck. Roger Moore and Pierce
¢, Brosnan both
starred in Saint
adaptations be-
fore they as-
sumed the Bond
mantle. Now
Val Kilmer (an-
other debonair
Englishman?)
takes on the first

widely seen American version of the tale.

In the grand American tradition, of course,
the character must have a brand-new cheesy
origin, incomprehensible emotional struggles,
and generally be nothing like the original char-
acter, because, much as that character might
have been perfectly suited for ajaunty action
caper, the studio is only interested in buying a
name that can headline a franchise. Well, this
time they’ve gone too far, and I’m very glad
they fall on their faces, because I never want
to see “The Saint 2” and the box office returns
make it seem likely that I won’t.

Simon is abused terribly in an orphanage
in the Far East from which he later escapes.
One confusing thing here is that this orphan-
age incident is labeled as occurring “Yester-
day,” while the remainder of the story, in
which Simon‘ is much older (Val Kilmer) and

  

PAGE 5

an international master thief for hire, is marked
“Tomorrow.” Now, I have no problem taking
these metaphorically, but why put them on
screen in the ﬁrst place? Because Noyce treats
second-guessing screenwriters like sacrilege.
If they write “Yesterday” and “Tomorrow”
in the script, it’s going to be on the screen.

Simon is hired by a Russian would—be dic-
tator named Tretiak (Rade Serbedzija) to steal
the secret fonnula for cold fusion, being de-
veloped at Oxford by shapely science girl Dr.
Emma Russell (Elizabeth Shue). Tretiak’s goal
is to own cold fusion and use it to solve the
heating crisis in Russia, which will presumably
cause the citizenry to silently assent when he
takes over from the elected govemment.

The only problem? Our intrepid (read
“flaky”) hero falls in love with Emma (duh!)
and so halfway through the deal he tries to
back out...or complicate the plan...or some-
thing. Chases, double-crosses, and weird
people hiding in sewers ensue. The twists are
pretty ingenious, if improbable, and are ad-
mittedly fun. But there are just too many de-
tails cluttering the whole thing up, taking the
ﬁlm in the direction of a romance, then an
action thriller, then a story of political intrigue,
then a future/science ﬁction meditation. The
Saint becomes an exercise in confusion.

A word about Val Kilmer’s disguises: In
the ﬁlm, The Saint is a master of disguise.
He dresses up like a goofy-looking professor,
a weird Spaniard and a South African artist.
None of this is clever, entertaining, or tied to
any kind of logic. The disguises are dumb,
the accents are dumb, and there’s no reason for
them. Val Kilmer’s a great actor. Now if he
would just take off the silly prostheses and act.

It’s not a bad ﬁlm, it’sjust not very enjoy-
able. And that’s the cardinal sin in my book.
There’s no emotional, suspense, or action pay-
off to the time invested in sitting through the
thing. The one thing Noyce does do right is
keep that camera focused tightly on his two
leads, Val Kilmer and Elizabeth Shue. The
eye candy is satisfying, but eye candy and a
couple of clever plot twists cannot overcome
the heavy burden of the rest of the ﬁlm.

‘APRIL 28, 1997

 JC wields power

‘F Why has the Student Judicial Council been given immense
power over student affairs, while few students know about it?
Only the leaders know.

The SJ C Blue Book is policy. With it comes a new list of
rules, regulations and punishments by which students must
live. Although the creation of the SJ C fills a major void
n etween the Honor System and student conduct, there cannot
be any more trials by the SJC until a Blue Book has been
hysically distributed to every student on campus.

To the SJ C’s credit, the Blue Book is available online and
a few copies were distributed in the library. However, the
page is difficult to get to, and except for some publicity in The
Ring-tum Phi and The Trident the word has not been passed
on to the student body as a whole that the page exists. Few
students on campus spendextensive amounts of time search-
ing for what is new on the university homepages. In addition,
the homepage has some significant ﬂaws, such as asterisks
which have no corresponding footnotes.

— There are several procedures which are unclear in the Blue
Book, and there are some others that are simply unfair:
°The SJ C says that if there are conﬂicts of interest with the
SJ C justices, student replacements will be chosen. Who
ebides if there is a conﬂict of interest, and how will the
a eplacements be chosen? Everything in the procedures is left
to the “discretion of the Chair,” but that seems a little too
ague for an organization with so much power.

°The appeals process for SI C rulings is unfair to the
students involved. Although any ruling can be appealed, the
appeal goes to the University Board of Appeals which decides
_ lﬁather the appeal will be heard. Ifa student wants to appeal the
ruling, that student shouldbeable to appeal—-—no matterwhat. The
appeal process should agree with that of the White Book, since it
's gupposed to be the model for the SJ C.

°Another problem with the SJ C is that a convicted student can
'7'» e punished by a dorm counselor, the Interfraternity Council and
he SJ C. If a punishment was implemented by one of the other
n rganizations, the SJ C could add an additional punishment. This
s not really fair to the student either.

°Finally, the SJ C should provide students in question with a list
f dvocates, as the Executive Committee does in honor trials.
u ently, this is not provided for in the Blue Book.

The Ring-tum Phi calls upon the SJC and the administration to
find the money to publish the Blue Book for all of Washington and
- ’ ’s 2,000 students. The SJ C is misrepresenting its full intentions
nd powers by not making a better effort to inform the student
)ody. For a university that prides itself on honor, this is inexcus-
' ble. Ifsuch a sweeping motion can be passed, the money for
slfull implementation should be found as well. The SJ C
ould stop its investigations and trials until the Blue Book is
istributed to every student on campus.

OPINION

Phi retracts April Fool’s Edition article

Howison, not Elrod, has rocked the world is metal audiences with wild KISS ways

In this month’s parody issue, TheRing-tum Phi made
a big mistake. We incorrectly named President John
Elrod asa memberof the band KISS. Actually, it was not
Elrod, but rather Dean of Students David Howison who
rocked and rolled with the metal legends. Howison
recently told me all the sordid details of his involvement

with the band in an exclusive interview.

  

PAGE 7

Betsy Green ’97

Howison was one of the first members of KISS and
was an important part of their formative years. He is
known now as “the ﬁfth KISS member.” Howison’s
inﬂuenceon the band wasvery important. “The guys had
a satanic image that didn’t play well with record compa-
nies, radio stations or parents of teenagers,” Howison
explained. “They called me ‘the wholesome KISS’
because I was married and had kids. Parents who had
been turned off by the blood and overall strangeness of

our act found me comforting.”

In concerts, Howison ’s wardrobe reflected the differ-
ence. “I had the big black hair and the black and white ,
makeup like the other guys,” Howison said, “but 
instead of wearing black and silver spandex, I wore
navy blue and khaki spandex. I keep hoping it’ll

come back in style.”

One aspect of Howison’s appearance, however,
meshed right in with KlSS’s image. “Not very many
people know this,” Howison conﬁded, “but my tongue

j.-_—

actually used to be longer than Gene Simmons’. I had

cosmetic surgery to reduce ittoanormal size aboutﬁfteen
years ago because it scared my kids. No one wants a dad

who can lick the back of his own head.”

Howison admits that he was surprised and a little bit
disgusted to see the Phi’s erroneous claim that Elrod had
joined KISS. “I respect (Elrod) as an educator and an
administrator, but let’sface it: the man couldn’t rock if his
lifedepended on it. Imean, KISS? Elrod’saWingerman

if I ever saw one.”

Howison has many fond memories of his days with

ﬂoor! It rocked.”

the band. “I love touring,” Howison said. “There is
nothing like having thousands of adoring fans cheering
your every move. But my favorite thing to do was to trash
hotel rooms. Thisone time I must have used every single
towel in the room. And I just left them crumpled on the

Howison admits, though, that life in the band did not
satisfy him. “Every night, there I’d be, rocking, wavingto
the fans, signing autographs, watching girls throw under-
wear at me, and I’d be miserable. I kept dreaming of

moving to a small town and being an administrator at a
small, conservativeliberal arts school. Sure it’s fun to
rock and roll all night and party every day, but after
a while, it’s enough already and you want to get
some sleep.”

Howison is happy to be following his true dream of

being a college administrator. “It’s really almost as
glarnorousasbeing in KISS. And now I rock and roll until
about 10 at night and party every other day. It’s a much
more manageable anangement.”

Convention protects American soldiers

Tomorrow, the Chemical Weapons
Convention takes effect, and thankfully
the United States is involved. Some Re-
publicans like Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) were

ily, Bob Dole and Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott cameouton the President’sside
and supported the measure. Their en-
dorsement gave the treaty a 74-26 victory,
eight votes more than needed.

The Chemical Weapons Convention
was started by President Reagan. Presi-
dent Bush later intensiﬁed efforts to ban
chemical weapons after the Gulf War in
1991. Bush signed the treaty on January
13, 1993, with l60othercountries. When
the treaty goes into effect tomorrow, over
70 nations will have ratiﬁed it.

Thetreatycallsforthedestruction of all
chemical weapons stockpiles in 10 years,
and member nations will undergo inspec-
tions to verify their compliance. It also
bans certain kinds of chemicals, such as
Mustard gas, ﬁrst used by the Germans in
World War I; Saran gas, used in the
terrorist attack on the Tokyo subway; and
Ricin gas. These and many other chemi-

cal agents are fairly easy to make. Other
countries which do not ratify the treaty
will have chemical shipments prohib-
ited so that these chemical agents will
be more difficult to produce. Why was
the treaty opposed?

Supporting the treaty were Presidents
Clinton, Bush, Fordand Carter,..retired
Generals Colin Powell and Norman
Schwarzkopf, former Senate Majority
LeaderBobDole andTrent Lott. With this
kind of bipartisan support, it is hard to
believe that the treaty was in trouble on

‘Capitol Hill.

The Chemical Weapons Convention
makes it moredifﬁcult fornogue stateslike
North Korea, Iraq and Libya to manufac-
ture and equip their armies with chemical
weapons. Opponents of the treaty argued
that we should not have ratiﬁed the treaty
until the rogue states ratiﬁed it as well, but
the treaty’s supporters were correct in
assuming that the United States needs to
bealeaderintheworld. By postponingthe
ratiﬁcation of the treaty, the U.S. came
very close to joining the rogue states in
opposition against the treaty.

What is amazing about the contro-
versy surrounding the issue is that the
treaty was promoted and signed by Presi-
dent Bush and the icon of modern conser-
vatism, Ronald Reagan. Some oppo-
nents, such as Jesse Helms and The Wall
Street Journal, worry too much about our

nationalsovereignty and notenough about

To helpthe ratiﬁcation of thetreaty, the
administration made a commitment to
keep our chemical defenses strong. This
way wecan ﬁght effectively in acontami-
nated environment. This was essential to
securing Lott ’s endorsement.

Even if the right-wing conservatives
are correct about the ineffectiveness of the
treaty, it needed to be ratiﬁed. The chance
that our armed forces could be protected
from chemical weapons necessitates our

inclusion in the treaty.

Will the treaty be effective? Prob-
ably. However, since chemical weap-
ons can be made in a sink or a bucket,
it will be hard to police, and the oppo-
sition was correct in assuming that the
cost of policing the treaty will be enor-
mous. However, the treaty’s cost is
small when compared to the number of
lives that could be saved by eliminating
chemical weapons.

Those savings could be us, our par-
ents and our kids.

“The 4x400m topped it off
and made it a great meet.”
Acuff won sixth place in the
400m and was part of the
winning relay team.

Dorofeeva placed first in the
800m and second in the 3000m.

“We had a really good year
thanks to our coaches,”
Dorofeeva said. “I was excited
to run, and I gave it everything I
had. This is one ofthe strongest
teams ever. We did our best and
worked really hard.”

Senior Natalie Messmore
won the 3000m with a time of
11:13.80, and sophomore Isaris
Bonilla placed second in the
200m and fourth in the 100m.

Hideki Irabu.

Irabu’s story bears retelling. It
was his boyhood dream to pitch for
the Yankees. Just like it was my
dream to play wide receiver for the
Eagles. It hasn’t come true, but I’ve
somehow come to grips with it.
Most athletes can forsake playing
for the team of their dreams if the
other team offers enough money.
That hasn’t worked for Irabu.

The San Diego Padres owned ex-
clusive signing rights to him
through an agreement with his Japa-

with them and retreated to Japan.

he Washington and Lee

women’s tennis team swept

through the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference Tournament last
weekend in preparation for their trip to
the NCAA tournament. The Generals
only lost one set at the championship.

Junior Natalia Garcia continued her
domination of the ODAC, only losing
three games in the entire tournament,
beating Guilford’s Betsy Parker in the
final 6- 1, 6-2. Garcia was named
ODAC Player of the Year for the sec-
ond straight year. Garcia was not avail-
able for comment.

Following suit in the second ﬂight
was Junior Ericka Shapard, who took
her No. 2 singles ODAC title 6-0, 6-1 .
Also claiming singles titles forthe Gen-
erals were: (3) Junior Beny Blankinship

After sweeping the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference Men’s Ten-
nis Championships, the Generals are
now preparing for the NCAA Re-
gional Championships on May 9th
at Emory University.

Last Friday and Saturday, Wash-
ington and Lee won every match but
the No. 2 singles, in which Brett
Eckley from Hampden Sydney de-
feated W&L’s Dale Pretila 6-2, 6-3.

Senior Chris Higgs, who defeated
Hampden Sydney’s Campbell
Palmer to win the No. 3 singles, said,
“I’m really proud of the team and the
way we played. We worked hard and
desereved to win.”

In two sets, senior Peter
Hammond won the No. 1 singles
against Bryan Duquette from
Hampden Sydney 6-3, 6-4.
Hammond was chosen as the 1997

at the major league level and dic-
tating where he should play. Not
to bash Japanese baseball, but I
guess one would rack up big num-
bers facing the likes of Rob Deer.
So the Padres ﬁnally placated
lrabu last week by shipping him and
minor leaguers Homer Bush, Gor-
don Amerson and Vernon Maxwell
for Yankee prospects Ruben Rivera
and Rafael “Funky Cold” Medina
and $3 million. At ﬁrst glance you
would think the Padres go the bet-
ter of the deal since they were get-
ting something in return for a player
they would probably never sign.
But to me, the deal looks even. The
Padres received Rivera, who has
been hyped as the next Mickey

“Mentally, we wanted a strong ﬁn-
ish to the ODACS,” said Hartzell. ‘y‘:Ve
really wanted to use it as a tune-up for
the nationals.”

The doubles teams of (1) Garcia
and Hartzell, (2) Blankinship and
Shapard, and (3) O’Connor and J ilhior
Mary Celeste Foster all claimed doubles
titles for the Generals. Only the team
of Garcia and Hartzell lost a set.

“Playing a lot of tough team dur-
ing the season really helped us,”
Hartzell commented, “We are a re-
ally strong team compared to the rest
ofthe ODAC teams.” ,

The Generals now turn their ey!-. to
the NCAA tournament, where they
placed second last year. “We are really
excited for nationals,” Hartzell said.

As of our publication time, th'

WASHINGTON & LEE UNIVERSITY

After years of upperclass sorority
women and freshman women tip-toe-
ing around constricting rush regula-
tions, the Panhellenic Council has re-
laxed the rules. Previous rules en-
tailed closed contact between upper-
classmen and freshmen, but the 1997-
98 year brings open contact and a
promise of a more comfortable rush.

“The girls who are the happiest af-
ter rush are the women who knew and
had friendships with upperclassmen
girls throughout the year,” Panhellenic
Judicial Vice President Sara McCrone
said. “The purpose of having open
contact is so that the girls can make
an informed decision about the soror-
ity they choose.”

In times of closed contact. upper-

classmen and freshmen could not so-
cialize together in the
upperclassmen’s residence, study to-
gether in a place other than the library
or eat meals together.

Open contact encourages upper-
classmen and freshmen to form rela-
tionships with each other by engag-
ing in those activities that were once
taboo.

“I think that this will make the pre-
rush period and actual rush less awk-
ward. People will be able to make
lasting friendships that will last be-
yond rush without being nervous
about breaking the rules.”

Panhellenic stresses that freshman
women cannot attend a sorority
woman’s party involving alcohol. “If
freshman women show up at such a
party, the sorority women who live
there should approach them and ask

“Beginning in spring 1997, (Wash-
ington and Lee) students will be re-
quired to register for classes online.”

What?

Don’t worry. This comment, along
with several others, was printed erro-
neously in the May 1997 issue of Ya-
hoof Internet Life. The online maga-
zine wrote an article on what it
deemed to be “America’s 100 Most
Wired Colleges.” W&L ranked 37th
in the ratings. However, according

to Science Librarian Hugh Blackmer,
the rating does not mean much.

A representative from Yahoo!
magazine called Blackmer and in an
informal interview asked him for in-
formation he could not provide with
100% accuracy.

“I pulled numbers out of the air,”
said Blackmer. “But they were as
good of an estimate as anyone can
make.”

Some of the estimates made by
Blackmer include percentages for the
number of student-owned computers,
classes with webpages and students

Panhellenic rules also prohibit so-
rority women from buying anything,
especially alcohol, for freshman
women, McCrone said. “This would
include paying for a meal,” McCrone
said.

Above all, the new rules promise
less stress for freshman women about
what they can and cannot do. “I just
don’t want the freshman girls to feel
any pressure anymore about breaking
rules,” McCrone said. “The rules are
a little vague and have a lot of lee
way.”

clude overtures toward a less materi-
alistic rush by cutting the budgets for

The one estimate printed by Ya-
hoo! with which Blackmer did not
agree was for classes with online
homework. Yahoo.’ printed it as 45%.
Blackmer thought is was high, but
then said he could not be sure.

“If they took into account the stu-
dents’ ability to communicate with
their professors about homework
through e-mail, then it could be 45%,”
said Blackmer.

THE RING- TUM PM

It was a message no one will
ever forget.
Every campus phone received

a message Saturday morning’

from Director of Communica-
tions Brian Shaw stating that
freshman John Joseph “Jack”
Bowden died Saturday from se-
vere head trauma.
Bowden allegedly fell
from his second ﬂoor
Gilliam Dormitory win-
dow Friday at9:38 p.m.
Sophomores Rebecca
Makkai and Katie Hinz
were on their way back
from aperformance at
Lee Chapel when
they found Bowden
in his boxer shorts
on the sidewalk be-
tween Gilliam and
the Overnight Guest house.
While Makkai stayed with
Bowden, Hinz ran to the inﬁr-
mary where the nurse called se-
curity and 911.

“At first I thought that he had
been shot,” Makkai said. “There
was blood all the way down to
the street.”

“When we got there, he
seemed frightened. Once we
began to take care of him, he
seemed to calm down . . . It was
almost like he went to sleep.”

She talked to Bowden, while
rubbing his arm, even though he
was unconscious. “I didn’t know
if he could hear me,” Makkai
said. “I told him not to move or
say anything, to keep breathing
and that he was going to be OK.”

Security and the paramedics
arrived within four to five min-
utes.

“It appears he fell out of the
second floor window and struck
his head on the sidewalk,” Direc-
tor of Security Mike Young said
yesterday. He would not specu-
late on the cause ofthe fall. “It’s
really a mystery. I can’t specu-
late, but it appears it was an ac-
cident.” Young said.

Paramedics took Bowden to
Stonewall Jackson Hospital
where he was stabilized and
then airlifted to Roanoke Me-
morial Hospital shortly after
midnight. He was admitted to

 

Bowden

the Neurotrauma Unit at 1:05 a.m.
Saturday morning. He was pro-
nounced brain dead early that morn-
ing due to severe head injuries.

Dean of Students David Howison
called Bowden’s parents from
Stonewall Jackson. Dr. Jane Horton
was on duty at the hospital and also
spoke with Bowden’s parents.
Howison then drove to Roanoke
Memorial.

Dr. and Mrs. Roger Bowden drove
from their home in
Darien, Conn. and ar-
rived in Roanoke at 8
a.m. Saturday and met
with Howison. After
consulting doctors, his
parents discontinued life
support and made the
decision to donate his or-

gans.
The university and
Lexington Police

Department’s investiga-
tions are still outstanding,
and no information has been released
yet. The officer on duty Friday night
Sergeant E.W. Straub had no com-
ment. ‘

Young asks that anyone with any
information about Bowden’s acci-
dent contact security or the police
immediately.

Bowden graduated from Darien
High School. At W&L, he was a
member of Beta Theta Phi fraternity
and an avid tennis player. Howison
stated that Bowden’s parents repeated
how much he loved W&L.

“He wasjust one ofthose guys that
got along with everyone on the hall,”
Gilliam 208 resident Brian Prisco
said. “You didn’t have to know him
really well to know he was a nice
guy.”

“He had a really happy personal-
ity,” hallmate Steven Straub said.
“This has been a really tough week-
end because a lot ofthe guys on the
hall were good friends with him.”

The university’s counselor Dean
Schroer-Lamont and the peer coun-
selors are available for any students
who need support. The Dorm Coun-
selors had a meeting with Schroer-
Lamont, Horton, and Dr. James
Worth also.

As of our press time, there have
not yet been funeral or memorial ser-
vices scheduled.

The Federal Campus
Security Act

After their daughter was raped and
murdered by a student who broke into
her Lehigh University donn room,
Howard and Connie Clery became the
driving force behind the enactment of
a federal campus security law.

The Campus Security Act was en-
acted in 1990 and requires colleges and
universities to annually publish their
crime statistics.

According to Security On Campus
Inc., an advocacy group started by the
Clerys, administrators at some schools
have circumvented the reporting re-
quirements for somecrimes by chan-
neling them into conﬁdential disciplin-
ary committees which are protected by
the Family Educational Rights and Pri-
vacy Act. The S.O.C. website, says
many schools are “hiding incidents
ﬁom law enforcement” and then us-
ing FERPA to “shield these records
from public view even when they are
the only adjudication of allegations of
felonious misconduct.”

In attempt to clarify procedures
outlined in the earlier act, Congress is
currently debating the Accuracy in
Campus Crime Reporting Act of 1997.
It would increase reported crime cat-
egories, open campus police logs, end
conﬁdentiality for students accused of
criminal activity and open the secret
on-campus disciplinary proceedings
where students accused of criminal
misconduct are oﬁen diverted.

campus security discussion

BY TARAH GRANT
PHI FEATURES EDITOR

Washington and Lee’s following
of the Campus Security Act was ques-
tioned at the Women’s Forum panel
discussion about campus security last
Thursday in the University Center.
The Campus Security Act deals with
reporting crimes against women.

“It is important to educate students
and raise awareness on issues that im-
pact students emotionally,” Women’s
Forum Advisor and Associate Dean
Anne Schroer-Lamont said. “Since
the undergraduate school had never
done an awareness program from the
legal standpoint, (forum leaders and
their Board of Advisors) decided to
sponsor one this year.”

Women’s Forum invited Attorney
Elizabeth Griffin ‘9l, who is em-
ployed by the Council ofHigher Edu-
cation of Virginia, Director of Secu-
rity Mike Young, Attorney and W&L
Law School Professor Joan
Shaughnessy and Dean David
Howison to the discussion.
Shaughnessy was the moderator of
the discussion.

Howison, who is “charged with the
responsibility ofenforcing (the Cam-
pus Security Act),” according to
Schroer-Lamont, was unable to attend

In their opening statements, the
invitees spoke on their areas of ex-
pertise. Griffin explained the Cam-
pus Security Act, which requires col-
leges and universities to publish their
crime statistics. Young emphasized
that security’s role is to make sure stu-
dents are safe. “We feel we are in
compliance with (the act),” Young
said. “We are doing as much as is
required and more.”

Students can take pride in know-
ing that W&L is a place one can feel
comfortable walking from the library
at 2 a.m., Young said.

He noted the two primary im-
provements in campus security since
he came in 1991: the installation of
the card access system and the devel-
opment and implementation ofa self
defense course for women. Young
also told audience members to note
the location ofsecurity call boxes on
campus and that if a student ever feels
uncomfortable about walking some-
place, and call security for a ride.

“We want to do everything pos-
sible to make sure it is safe and take
care ofyou, and in return we only ask
that you try to take care of yourself,
be aware, use common sense,”Young
said. “lt’s not in your best interest to

go out and get drunk because bad
things can happen to you.”

During the following question ses-
sion, Schroer—Lamont turned the con-
versation to what the university is not
doing, including informing students
ofdangerous situations, reporting ac-
curate statistics and clarifying report-
ing procedures.

A big concern at other campuses
is the use of the Rohyponol
(“Rophies”), a drug that causes
unconsiousness and amnesia and is
referred to as the “date rape”drug.
When a student audience member
asked about the use of Rohypnol on
campus, Young responded, “I can’t
say it hasn’t happened, it just hasn’t
been reported to us that we can con-
finn.”

Schroer-Lamont interjected that
the use of Rohyponol has been re-
ported to the Student Health Ser-
vices. “And Dr. Horton (the Uni-
versity Medical Director) has worked
with several patients who she feels
very likely were victims of, perhaps
not Rohyponol, but of some foreign
agent put into a drink where a person
went completely limp after having a
half glass of wine or half a beer,”
Schroer-Lamont said.

She explained that in the four
years that the university did sexual

assault surveys, “the same two fra-
ternities were named again and again
by women reporting they had taken
a drink at a party and had experienced
a very quick reaction of their legs
turning rubbery and passing out. 
There is a good chance that in past
years, even prior to Rohyponol, that
there were a couple of groups on
campus that did know of some agent
and few members may have used it
and a few of our female students may
have ingested it.”

Schroer-Lamont then mentioned
that the university has allegedly al-
tered crime statistics. She read from
the 1995 Report on Campus Crime
and Campus Security, which reported
no rapes for four years, 1991-95.

To Schroer-Lamont’s statement
Young said, “It can’t be.”

“Well it is, my eyes say,” Schroer-
Lamont replied. “It was interesting
when we looked at the earlier reports
and looked at the later ones, we saw
we had changed our numbers.”

According to Schroer-Lamont,
there is a discrepancy between sta-
tistics in the early federal reports that
went out to The Chronicle of Higher
Education and the ones that were
published the following year. Since
each report covers a span of four
years, “We have not been consistent,”
she said.

Schroer-Lamont also believes that

the university does not clearly explain
to students the procedures for report-
ing a crime so that it will be included
in the crime statistics. While Young,
who works with Howison in compil-
ing crime statistics, emphasized that
Security should be contacted in
sexual misconduct cases, the Student
Handbook says students should report
sexual misconduct to Dean Anece
McCloud.

Dean McCloud’s ofﬁce publishes
an annual report with numbers con-
cerning date rapes, rapes, sexual as-
saults and harassment that are “sub-
stantially larger” than those published
by Howison’s office. Schroer-
Lamont thinks students need to be
better informed of who they should
report cases to. “I don’t think there
is anywhere in the literature that says
students can report it to Mr. Young
or any of his staff members that work
in Security,” she said.

“It’s pretty common sense,”
Young responded. “You call me if
your wallet gets stolen, why wouldn’t
you call me for any other crime?”

Young said McCloud doesn’t
share information from her counsel-
ing sessions with him and that the
numbers reported in the crime statis-
tics are continued cases only where
an investigation has taken place.

“I just want to make it clear to
the students that if they have a

 

friend who has been assaulted, to
come by (Security) and go to Dean
McCloud and to talk to the Com-
monwealth Attorney and/or a police
officer,” Schroer-Lamont told the
audience. u

Several students stayed around
after the discussion to ask questions
one-on-one with the panel mem-
bers.

Sophomore Patrick McCormack,?
the only male audience member,
came to learn more about the legal
issues of campus security and left
concerned about how students felt
sexual misconduct students were
being handled.

‘‘I think W&L is doing every-
thing it can to live up to the obliga-
tions of the law,” he said. “What,
worries me is that concern about
sexual misconduct cases continues
to be an unresolved issue for so
many ofour classmates.  I think
some students are overwhelmed by»
our current system and I think more
could be done to explain it.”

Schroer-Lamont believes that the
evening was a success if awareness’,
was raised and the audience went
away with helpful information. “If
the program also encourages people
to ask more questions and work to
make our campus even safer, then),
the program was a double success,”
she said.

Websites of the Week

BY MATTHEW CRAIG
PHI STAFF WRITER

This week marks the beginning ofa new feature in
The Ring—tum Phi, the websites of the week. Essen-
tially, every week I plan, to use a trite expression, to
“surf the web,” and locate three webpages that I find
particularly amusing. Each week will also have a theme
of some sort. In other words, I’m going to subject you
to the tyranny of my own sense of humor.

The sites that the Phi" staff has located this week for
your amusement or horror, depending upon how you
look at it, are prime examples of what happens when
people with computers have too much free time. All of
these websites can be accessed from the Phi online at
http: / /www . wlu . edu/~phi. The websites selected
for this week are:

The Cheese Site

http: / /www. trencll . com/~l'1arrisb/cheese/
cheese . html

This site sounds pretty tame, but truthfully it’s pretty
bizarre. The links off of this page include my personal
favorite, the cheese torture shop, the cheese command-
ments, use for 160 slices of American cheese, and what
this guy does in school.

The Elite Giffy Peanut Butter
Exchange

http: / /www . graceland . edu/~elroyomj /

This site is actually some guy’s homepage, who in
an apparent fit of boredom came up with some hilari-
ous links. You can check out two old guys in a sauna or
the ﬁve greatest yak pictures of all time, but first and
foremost, you have to cast your votes in the cool guy
contest. Juan Valdez gets my votes. I just love his pimpy
clothes.

Monkeys Typing Shakespeare

http: / /bronte . cs . utas . edu . au/monkey/

I think this one is pretty self-explanatory, but for those
of you who don't have as keen a grasp of the obvious
I'll provide one. This site is an experiment to see ifa
group of monkeys can randomly type in Shakespeare’s
famous line of “to be or not to be.” So far, they’re do-
ing slightly better than a group of Roanoke college stu-
dents. Hopefully, sometime in the near future, l’ll be
able to hire these guys to write my papers for me.

STUDENT BODY NOTICE p

The Student-Faculty Hearing Board met at the end of Winter Tenn 1997 and heard testi-
mony regarding the complaint of sexual misconduct. The complaint was made by a Washing-

ton and Lee female concerning the sexual misconduct against her by a Washington and Lee
male. The board found the male guilty of unwanted sexual contact and imposed the following

penalties:

° Conseling with a Washington and Lee counselor for a minimum of six hours.
° Referral by a University counselor to an alcohol abuse program.

° Conduct probation for the remainder of residence at Washington and Lee. Any
future conviction on sexual misconduct charges will be grounds for the more
serious penalites of either suspension or dismissal from the University.

According to Yahoo!, W&L cur-
rently has online registration, online
add/drop, and online syllabi.

University Registrar Scott
Dittman told the Phi last week that
he wants to move toward online reg-
istration, but the estimated cost of
$35,000 is too expensive at this
time.

Blackmer said the Yahoo! rep-
resentative did not ask him anything
about student affairs, so he has no

idea where the magazine got its infor-
mation.

Overall, Blackmer said that one can
not put much stock in the ratings.

“For the questions asked, there was
no objective way to know the an-
swers,” said Blackmer.

In addition, part of the rating re-
lied on whether W&L had an online
gaming, chat or dating service; or a
popular online hangout.

W&L did beat out schools such as
Brown (43), Cornell (50), Yale (60),
Harvard (64) and University of Vir-
ginia (69). Topping the list were
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(1) and Northwestern University (2).

a rush with less frills and have been
very successful,” McCrone said.
“Rush is about the women know-
ing each other and mutually select-
ing each other, not about which so-
rority can dazzle the most amount
of girls with the most decorations.”

The newest sorority, Kappa
Delta, will be treated fairly in the
budget for rush dates. “All of the
other sororities have props and

decorations from previous years,
and because KD doesn’t have all of
that stuff, something will be done
to level the playing field.”

McCrone expects and welcomes
questions about the new rush rules
in the upcoming year.

“Panhellenic thinks the new open
contact rules and the move toward
a no frills rush will be positives
changes,”McCrone said. “We are 0
excited to see the results. Rush will M
be changed for the better.”

Correction

The Ring-tum Phi incorrectly cited Patrick O’Connell ran against Greta
Richter for SJC Secretary in: “SJC Blue Book: how the whole thing
happened.” Incorrect information was given to the reporter on the
following: Robert Comvington was elected by the student body. The
artcle was written before the end of Winter Term at which time the
Council was unclear as to when the Blue Book would take effect. It
does not take efect until the ﬁrst day of Fall Tenn 1997. All students

Soon, running through the woods,

brandishing weapons and hunt
in g camouﬂage-clad opponents will
be an everyday activity in Buena VlStlL
Blue Ridge Paintball will introduce
the city to the sport of paintball when
it opens May 3. T he facility, set on a
wooded two acre ﬁeld, will oﬂer the
excitement and challenge of one of

America ’s newest pastimes.

Paintball is a combination of hide-and-go-
seek and tag, where players “tag” one another
by using air guns to shoot their opponents with
pellets full of paint. The sport, which origi-
nated in the early 1980s, can be played in a
variety ofways, the most common being “Cap-

 

ture the Flag.” In any version of the game,
when a player is hit by a paintball, the
paintball splits open, leaving a bright paint
mark on the person’s clothing. The player
is then out. The paint is nontoxic,
noncaustic and water-soluble, and will wash
out ofclothing and off of skin, according to
the homepage of the National Paintball 

Network. For more information on the'~.‘,_"€
sport, point your web browser to '
http: //www. orrlinepaintball . corn.”

Kenny Lewis, who operates Blue, _
Ridge Paintball, has played and en-
joyed paintball and would recommend" ”
it to anyone.

“It really gets your adrenaline going,”
Lewis said. “lt’s the closest thing to war
games around.”

Lewis’ new facility will offer nearly
two acres of wood and ﬁeld on which to
play two different versions of paintball:

Tickets for musical available

Don’t forget to get tickets for W&L’s production of
“Into the Woods.” The musical is a collaboration of the
music and theater departments. Such collaborations only
occur about once every three years. Previous joint pro-
ductions were “The Marriage of Figaro” and “Evita.”

“It’s a very exciting time,” Professor Al Gordon,
director of the show, said “We all look forward to it
It’s a lovely musical with really intriguing music.”

Molly Harmon said working on the production is
fun “I really enjoy meeting the new people,” she said.

The box oﬂice reports that tickets will probably sell
out by the week before the performances, so reserve

cial mask for eye protection and the use

of the grounds. If you want to use your

‘own paintgun, there is a $6 field charge.

Also, Lewis can fill your CO2 tanks for a
nominal fee.

“We’re new. We’re going to be ﬂexible and
we’ll work with people,” Lewis said.

Players are encouraged to wear clothing
which covers all of their body, including
gloves. Although the balls can sting, play-
ers should not be bothered if they are ad-
equately clothed.

lue Ridge Paintball is located one mile

south on Route 501, about a twenty minute
drive from Lexington. Anyone interested in
playing should call for reservations, pref-
erably four days to a week in advance.
There is no minimum group size, but a
deposit is required for larger groups. For
reservations, call (540) 261-9157.

All proceeds will be used to buy construc-
tion materials. It is the first in what will be-
come a series of events designed to raise
enough money to pay for the house. If all
goes as planned, construction will begin
sometime late next fall.

The dance will be an old-fashioned square
dance. Wildgrass will provide the music and
Becky Mackenzie will call all the dances.
The organizers stress that no previous expe-
rience is needed; they just want everyone to
come out and contribute.

In the meantime, the W&L Habitat
chapter will continue construction on its
third house. Begun earlier this year, the
house should be finished by the middle
of the summer. Usually, students work

from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
on Saturdays,
and the local
Habitat chapter
will be assuming re-
sponsibility for the con-
struction after classes end
in late May. The local
chapter is always look-
ing for support from
W&L students.

The dance begins at

mission is $5 per person or $8 per couple.

Dust off those Birkenstocks and get
ready to lend a hand. Earth Day comes to
Washington and Lee University Thursday
from 1 la.m. to 3p.m., two weeks after the
national festivities held April 22.

The program, sponsored
Abythe Recycling Commit-
tee and the Environment
Awareness Committee,
calls for a mix of entertain-
ment and volunteerism.

“We’re having an Earth
Day to increase student
awareness of campus envi-
ronmental groups and show
students how much can be
done for the environment,” ﬁeshman Recy-
cling Committee member Katie Hudson said

The main event will be a recycling con-
test. The student or group gathering the
most cans will win a pizza party for thirty
people. Two Night Owl Music gift cer-
tiﬁcates will be given out as door prizes
to people bringing in cans.

Entemtainment in the Graham-Lees

 

led by sophomore Chartlotte Graham.

“The traditionally conservative W&L stu-
dents do not get involved with environmental
issues because they view it as ‘tree-hugging,”
Hudson said. Events like Earth Day, tree
plantings and roadside clean-ups are designed to
change those perceptions and
encourage involvement.

To boast involvement, the
Recycling Committee and En-
vironmental Awareness Com-
mittee are designing a program
to encourage involvement with
the incoming freshmen.

“We have to try and get
people to appreciate the im-
portance of recycling and
other environmental issues,” E.A.C. head
Anthony Dvarskas said.

Both Hudson and Dvarskas encourage
W&L students to pitch in for the environ-
ment. The E.A.C. meets Mondays at 8:30

p.m. in the University Center Game ﬂ

Room. To become a part of the Outing

stomachs, expectations

or the most part, the Delt alumni

have slack jobs and like to show

up early for big weekends in Lexing-
ton. Spos did as much and arrived the Thurs-
day before Alumni Weekend, so we decided
to return to one of our old favorites, The
Staircase, with Spos and “Yale-Boy” Jason
in tow.

The Staircase is located in the basement
of Mountain Copy and Graphics; the own-
ers have done much to improve the
dungeonesque atmosphere that plagued the
previous restaurant in their location. Brightly
lit with music always playing, the atmo-
sphere in The Staircase is great for what they
offer: All-American dining.

The menu is varied, offering everything
from Burgers to Steak to Chicken Florentine
to Vegetable Stir-Fry. The Staircase offers
regular dinner specials on most nights, and the
bar has a wide selection of beverages including
our favorites, Guinness and Bass, on tap.

Jason, having recently ﬁnished his En-
glish Comps, decided to eat early and dedi-
cate the rest of the evening to assorted bev-
erages. We “ordered up a mess of’ Buffalo
Wings to start. Doug and Spos enjoyed
them, but Robin found the wings to be a
little too spicy for her palette. The res-
taurant was really packed and the wings
were slow coming out of the kitchen but
were worth the wait.

Ehicago playing respectably
FAN from page 8

Hekt and his old team, the Knicks, might be entertain-
ing, the Lakers-Jazz series in the Western Conference
should easily be the best series of the second round and
will likely determine which team will lose to the Bulls in
the ﬁnals this year. The Lakers have Shaq, which can be
a h‘essing or a curse depending on which way you look
at it, but the Jazz have Karl Malone, who keeps getting
better with age. This will be the big test to see if Utah
, It finally end its perpetual playoff misery. Speaking
isery, the Chicago Cubs should adopt Dog’s Eye
V1e~w’s “Everything Falls Apart” as their official theme
song. Don’t look now, things just got worse. This hap-
pened Friday night when closer Mel Rojas blew up in
Los Angeles.

‘ J he Cubies had actually begun to play semi-respect-
jble ball lately before handing the ball to Rojas with a 7-
‘ lead in the ninth inning Friday. Rojas then put on a
w that would make even Mitch Williams wince.

Ironically, it was on a Friday night at this same time of
year in 1993 when the Wild Thing entered a game in LA
with a 7-6 lead and walked the bases loaded with no outs
before somehow retiring the side for the save. Rojas‘ did
him one better. Mel walked the bases loaded, and then
after getting two outs and the pressure mounting, he walked
another batter to force in the tying run. The Dodgers went
on to win in the 10th and the Cubs sank to 6-21.

Chicago had signed Rojas to a $13.75 million con-
tract in the off-season, thinking that on those rare oc-
casions when the starting pitcher made it to the 8th or
9th inning with a lead, Rojas could nail it down. In-
stead he has blown three of five save chances, and man-
ger Jim Riggleman is spelling “relief” with a four-
letter word.

But while the Cubs continue to find innovative
ways to lose, at least Harry Caray’s bar in Chicago
is making money with its 45-cent beers. Why 45
cents? The last time the Cubs won the NL pennant
was in 1945.

5 he answer is . . .

It is one thing to question the Honor System, it is
'~ nether to do it anonymously.

I A letter from a concerned group of students was
tinted in the last edition of the Trident. These students
V‘ uestioned the outcome of recent trials, cited instances
f paranoia and specifically criticized members of the
&L community for not upholding the portion of the
hite Book that requires “a student with knowledge of
possible honor violation (to) confront the person

- ected and ask for an explanation of the incident.”
All of these are valid concerns, questions many of
s have asked ourselves at one time or another. But

> ithout knowing who wrote it, the credibility of the

V: uthors is immediately diminished.

Our single sanction system has survived for over a

.00 years because of student criticism. At one time
omosexuality was considered a violation of the Honor
'y§tem. Today’s concept of dishonorable conduct has
volved beyond sexual preference.

The Honor System is meant to evolve with the
tudent body. The White Book Review Committee is
harged with examining all aspects of the Honor Sys-
m. This includes asking what the Washington and Lee
oﬂimunity thinks about the Honor System.

This has been a year for openly questioning the

or System. The Executive Committee recently
vised the White Book after hearing the White Book
eview Committee’s recommendations. The spark lit by
eir questions should not be snuffed out.

‘Y What has led the anonymous students to believe

ey are living in George Orwell's 1984? When did our
ampus, our students, become hostile to informed,
ncerned criticism?

" There are those among us who attack proponents of
. ange. There are those among us who believe that what
should always be. There are those among us who

ou_ld attack students for criticizing the Executive“
oilnmittee.

The student body needs to protect itself. We need
create an environment where students don’t fear vocal
iitjcism of the EC will result in backlash and ridicule.

0 There is no reason students should fear what they
-eated and now control. The answer is open criticism in
I open environment. If we fail to do this the Honor
ygem will crumble like those of many other universi-
es across the country.

Welfare reform
threatens lives

The countdown has begun. To
students at Washington and Lee,
this countdown could be a variety
of things: for seniors, a countdown
to graduation; for other students,
simply a countdown to the end of
Spring term. But the countdown to
which I refer has deeper conse-
quences and implications for
5(X),(X)0— a half million — legal
immigrants. Forsomc mcmbersof
this alienated and targeted group,

From the Left

this countdown will perhaps make
the difference between life and
death. ln 100 days, the problems
which legal immigrants face will
increase a hundredfold.

On August 22, 1996, President
Clinton signed into law a highly
controversial welfare bill which,
among other things, created a ban
on all public beneﬁts to legal immi-
grants. Beginning August 1 of this
year, legal immigrants will system-
aticallybedeniedfoodstamps,non—
emergency health care and supple-
mentary Social Securitypayments.

The refusal of supplemental
security income beneﬁts is by far
the most signiﬁcant provision. S1
is the govemment’s basic cash as-
sistanee program for the elderly
and disabled poor. As the law
cunently stands, these beneﬁts can

only be received when the legal
immigrant earns his U.S. citizen-
ship. However, many of these
people — due to the fact that they
are elderly or disabled ~— are not
able to fulﬁll the requirements to
gain citizenship. 'lhus, these legal
immigruntswill be denied lite-sus-

taining assistance for the rest of

their lives.

In a study by the Urban Insti-
tute, it was found that L2 million
ofthe2.6millionpcoplewhowould
be made poor by the new welfare
law —— nearly half — were legal
immigrants. lnthe Newt Gingrich-
led 104th Congress’ intense clamor
for welfare reform, the United
States’ strong immigrant heritage
was pushed to the wayside, yet
anotherexample of conservative
Republicans placing ﬁscal mat-
tersoverconscience and humani-
tarian needs. The Republican
Party has always used immi-
grants as a scapegoat for U.S.
economic problems, but immi-
grants only account for a mere
5% of federal welfare expendi-
tures. Legal immigrants pay
taxes, serve in our armed forces
and also help to build U.S. con-
sumer demand. There is no need
to mention the supreme contri-
butions that immigrants have
given our country throughout its
short history. Legal immigrants
do not deserve to be punished as
they will be under the welfare
bill.

is this the type of welfare
reform the American people
wanted? While our motives for
welfare reform were good —
movingable-bodied people from
welfare rollstoemploymentpay—
rolls —— did we intend to move
elderly and disabled people who
have the distinction of being “le-
gal immigrants” from hospitals
and nursing homes to homeless
shelters and streets?

These sentiments are not ex-
clusively “liberal” or “Demo-
cratic.” Republican governors
with large immigrant constitu-
encieshavebecomeincreasingly
worried and have recently gone
publicwiihtheirconcems. They
fear the public relations disaster
that is sure to occur once legal
immigrants stop receiving fed-
eral beneﬁts. if the federal gov-
ernment does not continue its

assistance to legal immi-
grants, they will be forced
to limit their own expendi-
tures in other salient areas
such as job training and
child care. Although Re-
publicans in Congress refuse
to acknowledge legal immi-
grants’ existence and need
for assistance, legal immi-
grants are a presence that
cannot be ignored.

Guard your spring term fun against May rain

ldon’t think I’m alone in being sorely
disappointed with the weather so far for
most of spring term. Lexington is sup-
posed to be an Edenic ﬁeld of sunshine,
full of ﬂowers and singing birds--the kind
of weather that makes it impossible to be

inside. Instead, for ‘most o£.the.past few
weeks, it has been cold and cloudy. Gale
force winds have forced us into the library
to take shelter. This is spring term? My
last one? i want my money back!

Judging from the view out my win-
dow, it looks like our worries are over and
spring is ﬁnally here. But in case it’s not,
here are a few possible ways to cope with
the weather.

Work with it. Okay, so the weather’s

less than perfect. We’re all smart people;
we can make this fun. Maybe you wish
you could go to Goshen and bask on a rock
in the sun. Instead, why not don a wetsuit
and round up a few friends for ice ﬁshing?
Wooeee, doesn’t that sound fun?

Maybe this weather can be a way for
you to experiment. What does bourbon
taste like heated? If you put it in your
favorite drinkin’ mug and garnish it with
acinnamon stick, it mightnot be bad. And
you already know that warm beer isn’t so
tasty§‘b’§i£inayt;iE hot beer would be better.
Hint: take thebéer out of the can before
you put it in the microwave.

Finally, W&Lstudents can make any-
thing into adrinking game ifthey put their
minds to it. Gather up some friends.
Drink once for every cloud in the sky. For
every 2 MPH the wind blows, drink once.
Chug until it stops raining. Before long,
you’ll forget how cold it is outside.

DeniaL Here’s your logic: it’s May.

May is a warm month. So gosh darn it, I
will act like it’s warm. No matter how
cold it is, wear shorts and sunglasses at all

times. Carry around iced tea to quench
your thirst. Lay out, even if it’s raining.
You’ll still get to do all of the fun things
you associate with spring term, for the

low, low cost of pneumonia!

WorkMurphy’s Law. If we all work
together, we can trick the twisted laws of
nature into giving us what we want. Go
out and buy a whole lot of sweaters and a
new wintercoat and wear them all at once.
Buy fourumbrellas, just in case. Put snow
tires on your car. Send the power com-
pany money in advance for the big heat-
ing bill you’ll be racking up. Before long,
we’ll have a heat wave.

Post office grapples with e-mail technology

The Lexington Post Ofﬁee, the only one in the country to

‘still use the Pony Express, has recently been ﬂooded with

mail sporting incomprehensible addresses. Apparently,
numerous mentally deﬁcient rednecks have been trying to
latch ontothe new technology of e-mail. ‘‘I can’t tell you how
many letters we get each week addressed to something like

My View

Kevin MeManemin ’0O

frank_costanza@hotmail.com orkmcdonald@comell.edu,”
Postmaster General Norm Fitzblatz said.

Other silly people try to apply the modern terminology to
old addresses, resulting in addresses such as
Tarquin_Ki$enger@23l_Lrberty_StreetPlainﬁeld.NJ.07062.

‘‘I suppose we can ﬁgure out where to mail those, but we
just really don’t care,” Fitzblatz said.

“Normally, if one of those letters slips into my bag, it just
ends up in the gutter,” post(wo)man Sally Wobgobbler said.
When asked if she meant the letters with the e-mail addresses,

she replied, “No, just any letters in general.”

‘‘I haven’t really noticed any difference in the mail lately,”
long—time post ofﬁce employee Charles Bobby Joe John
Jordan Danny Donnie Bob Bobby Bob Bob Bo Bob
Rockenfeller said. “Then again, I can’t read.”

Rockefeller was unmoved by the plight of the mistaken
mailers. ‘‘I haven’t done any work here since the late sixties
and l’ll be damned if I start caring about other people’s mail
now,” Rockefeller said.

Other postal employees took a different approach to
problems with the mail. “They all must die! They all must
die! They all must die!” Cy Copath muttered as he shivered
in the comer, clutching his assault riﬂe. Agreeing with
Copath was Susan Looni, who spoke to us from behind the
sandbags pi led on her desk. ‘‘If they can’t get the addresses
right, I say brutally murder them all,” Looni said. M

The postal employees have not seen anything like this in
Lexington since the advent of the phone. Back then, the post
ofﬁce had to deal with tons of letters addressed to numbers
like 555-8536 or 1-9(1)-909-4300. The advent of the phone
in Lexington having occured just three years ago, they still
receive a fair amount of such mail today. “Don’t even
mention the telegraph,” Fitzblatz said. “You try ﬁguring out

where to mail ..—.—.-..-.——-.——.—.-...”

“The most revolting part about working at the Lexington
Post Ofﬁce, aside from theodorof tobacco juicecomingfrom
where the toothless yokels licked the stamps—l’m sorry, l
suppose that is the most revolting part about working here,”
Dean of the Post Ofﬁce Larry Walsh said.

Why is there a dean of the post ofﬁce? ‘“lhere’s some-
thing in the town chatter about one out of every four
Lexington residents having to be a dean,” some old guy who
once read the town charter explained.

‘ ‘‘I myself am distrustful of the mail. Why, I gota letterfrom
EdMcMahonpromisingme$10millionseveral yeaisago,and
l’m still waiting for my check,” Nigel Phipps, a Lexington
resident who gets a lot of mail, said. Phipps got his draft notice
just last week and will soon be off to ﬁght for our American
freedomsagainst Hitler, Mumlini and that Japanese guy. “l’ll
just clean out my musket, catch the next stagecoach to the base
and join up with my cavalry regiment,” a noticeably drunk
Phipps said. When asked if he had any suggestions as to how
thisarticleshouldend, Phippsreplied,“lsupposeyou could end
it with another telegraph joke.” When asked if he had a better
suggestion foranendingtothispiece, Phippssuggested that we
leave him the  alone. And so we shall.

“We were cheering for the clock,” a VMI
senior said.

The Generals dominated the Keydets for
55 minutes of the 10th Lee-Jackson Clas-
sic Saturday, and came away with a 22-8
victory before 2,800 fans at Alumni Sta-
dium. It was the Generals’ ninth straight
win over VMI.

Washington and Lee’s 22 goals broke
their previous Lee-Jackson high of 18
scored in 1990 and 1993.

W&L dominated VMI in every aspect of
the game, from goals, to shots, to face-offs.
The Generals also physically overpowered
VMI using their team speed to run circles
around the Keydets.

"Every year we get pumped up," said
junior Tom Fallace. "They're a very physi-
cal and hard-working team -- we like to play
up to their level."

Senior Ande Jenkins led the Generals
with ﬁve goals and three assists earning him
the Worrel—Fallon award for Most Valuable
Player in the Lee-Jackson Classic. The
eight points gave him 86 points for the sea-
son, breaking the school record of 85 set

Jenkins led off the scoring one minute
into the game setting the tone for the rest
ofthe game.

W&L out shot VMI 68-26.

VMI evened the score, but Ed Dougherty
and freshman Colin Dougherty scored three

goals to end the first quarter 4-1.

After trading goals early in the second
quarter, the Generals held the Keydets
scoreless until 6:30 left in the third quar-
ter. During that period, the Generals scored
10 unanswered goals.

W&L led 10-2 at the half. Jenkins
started the second halfthe same way as the
ﬁrst, scoring 1:09 into the third quarter. A
minute later, Colin Dougherty intercepted
the VMI goalie’s pass and passed it to fresh-
man Lee Fentress, who scored on the open
net to increase the lead to 12-2.

Colin Dougherty followed 16 seconds
later with another goal.

The Generals had a goal waved off be-
cause ofa crease violation right before the
end ofthe third quarter. The quarter ended
16-3. Junior Robb Greenﬁeld grabbed the
ball 56 seconds into the fourth quarter and

of the season.

First NCAA title in sight for women’s tennis

Photo by Hollister Hovey/Photo Editor

Junior Berry Blankinship will represent the
W&L women’s tennis team in the NCAA
tournament.

BY JASON ZACHER
PHI EXECUTIVE EDITOR

Appearances can be deceiving.

While the women’s tennis team looked light and jok-
ing at practice last week, they are intensely focused on
their goal this week — capturing the national title that has
eluded them for two years.

“That’s the thing that’s deceptive about this team.
They’re loose, they’re laughing, they’re having fun. It is
obvious they enjoy what they are doing, but when it’s time
to buckle down, they dig in,” said coach Cinda Rankin.

Led by juniors Natalia Garcia, Berry Blankinship and
Ericka Shapard, the team starts play tomorrow against
Pomona-Pitzer on Pomona’s home court. Last year, the
Generals fell to Emory University 5 in the championship.

The Generals received a fourth seed for this year’s
NCAA tournament. Kenyon College is ﬁrst, followed by
Emory and Amherst. Earlier in the season, the Generals
lost to Kenyon and Amherst by a score of 6-3. “We lost to
them, but we’re not down because of it. We’re anxious to
play them,” said Rankin.

Blankinship added, “we’re hungrier than we would
have been if we had beaten them.”

In addition to the team’s NCAA bid, Garcia and
Shapard earned individual bids. The doubles team of
Garcia and freshman Brook Hartzell also earned a bid.

The team has some very high expectations placed on
them. They have finished in the top six for each of the
last three years, including a second place ﬁnish last year.
This year, they blew through their competition, sweeping
eight matches 9-0, beating two tournament teams (Mary
Washington and Sewanee), winning the ODAC title for
the seventh straight year, and on top of this, ﬁve of their
seven players already have NCAA tournament experience.

The experience may be what pays off for the Generals.
“I know what to expect. As a freshman I was over-
whelmed. 1 didn’t know what to expect. Now, there is
less pressure,” said Blankinship.

“They know what to expect, and that teaches you a
lot,” added Rankin.

With this experience, and their dominating play all sea-

son, there are some people who feel this is the Generals’
year.

“They’re right,” said Blankinship. “We’re incredibly
strong this year. Our attitude is different and we are more
pumped-up.”

The Generals face a tough challenge this week.
Pomona-Pitzer’s number one singles player, senior Claire
Turchi, is a former singles national champion. More im-
portantly, the Generals are in the same bracket with
Gustavus Adolphus College and Kenyon.

“We know it is (Pomona’s) home court, and we know
they have an extremely strong top of the lineup. Our
strength is down the line, we’ve got good players all the
way,” commented Rankin. ‘

Despite others’ expectations, the Generals are keep-
ing theirs to a minimum. Coach Rankin commented,
“I try to have no expectations because expectations lead
to disappointment. lfwe play the best we can, no mat-
ter what happens, 1 will be really excited."

Total domination.

That was the theme of the day Saturday afternoon
as Washington and Lee hammered Virginia Military
Institute, 22-8, at Alumni Memorial Field to win its
ninth straight Lee-Jackson Lacrosse classic.

Unlike‘ recent years where the Keydets have resil-
iently hung around, they had no chance this year. A
W&L squad angered at barely missing the Division
III tournament took out its frustration on an over-
matched VMI team. The generals stormed out to a
10-2 half-time lead and extended it to 17-3 by the
end of the third before the Keydets made the score
somewhat more respectable.

What was more impressive than the final score
was the way the Generals completely dominated the
Keydets. They totally outplayed, out hustled, and out
muscled a team from a military school, of all placed’.
Almost the entire game was played on the VMI half
of the ﬁeld, a tremendous effort by the Generals.

No matter how well they played Saturday, it will
still be tough for the Generals to wash away the bit;
ter taste of Tuesday’s upset loss to Randolph-Ma-
con, which ended any chance of making the Division
III playoffs. But there is no way that an 1 1-3 season
and a #10 ranking in Division III should be classiﬁed
as disappointing. Congratulations to the Generals for
a well-played season.

The first round of the NBA playoffs is ﬁnally com-
pleted and now the real actions begins. (Is there any
good reason why the NBA and NHL need to includ
nearly two-thirds of its teams in the playoffs and ex-
tend the season two more months? For the most part
it only serves to milk some more TV dollars and sub-
ject viewers to watching the Clippers and Bullets three
more games than needed. And to think so many .
people complain about the wild card round in base-

- ball. . .) Although the match-up between Pat Riley’s

Student death sparks debate

BY ANDREA EWING AND
DARCEY LIVINGSTON
THE R1A'G— Tl/M PH1

Are student attitudes toward alco-
hol a problem at Washington and Lee?
Almost ﬁfty students met in Gaines
Hall last night to discuss how they
could change the way students view
drinking. The meeting was organized
by freshman Brooke Stanley and sev-
eral of her sorority sisters last week.
Stanley stressed that the meeting did
notjust stem from the recent death of
W&L freshman Jack Bowden, which
might have been alcohol related.
“It’s been simmering all year,”

Stanley said. “It’s not a movement
because of what happened. Ifit was
such, it would be short lived. Because
ofthe incident, students are ﬁred up.
But this has been brewing all year,
notjust with myself. but with others.”
Senior Ko—Ming Chang, who
helped Stanley organize the meeting,
expressed a similar opinion.
“Overdrinking goes on here all the
time,” said Chang. “You always see
people passed out at parties, but it’s
uncool to put that sort ofthing down.
You always hear guys bragging about
it. Whoo-hoo.”
Most of the concerned students
do not want to ban alcohol from cam-

pus. lnstead, they want to encourage
responsible alcohol consumption and
alternatives to drinking.

“I want to see suggestions of fun
things to do outside ofthe band party/
get—drunk scene,” Stanley said.

Stanley talked to Dean of the
Freshman Program Dennis Manning
and Dean OfStudents David Howison
to discuss ways to address the issue.
According to Stanley. the administra-
tion realizes it can change the rules,
but said any modiﬁcation of univer-
sity policy must come from the stu-
dents. The deans maintained that stu-

VMI welcomes a few good women as Sister Rats

BY KATHRYN MAYURNIK
PHI NEWS EDITOR

After almost a year of pre-op, Virginia Military Institute
appears ready for its sex change.

Less than a year after their defeat in United States vs. Vir-
ginia, at least twenty—seven out of the sixty-four accepted
women will enter the barracks as “Rats” on August 18. Two
ofthese women have SAT scores over 1540. One woman, a
physics major, achieved an 800 verbal score.

“These women are extremely qualified,” VMI superin-
tendent Maj. Gen. Josiah Bunting III said.

“Our goal is to go about the assimilation of women into
VMI better than any other school has done in the past,” As-
sistant to the Superintendent Col. Michael Bissell said.

VMI studied fourteen other colleges that went co-ed, in-
cluding Washington and Lee.

“We’ve garnered what they’ve done wrong and learned
from that,” Bissell said.

Every VMI cadet and faculty member underwent a six
hour orientation dealing with issues like fratemization, sexual
harassment and hazing.

“We’ve made it clear to the cadets that we will not toler-
ate any inappropriate behavior toward women,” Bunting said.

“I think that for this to work the cadets must have owner-
ship of it,” Bissell said. “We have immersed the cadets in
the preparations, and bless their hearts, they’ve worked hard.”

Starting in the fall, VMI will have an exchange program
with Texas A&M and Norwich University, Six upperclass
VMI cadets will spend the semester at each college, learning
how an established co-ed military school operates. In turn,
four men and two women will spend the semester at VMI,

If the President and Congress fail to

agree on a 1998 ﬁscal year budget by the
end ofthe year, education spending might
be reduced. The Senate Appropriations
Committee approved a proposal April 30
that would cut education spending in such
a circumstance.

If the proposal is adopted and the ﬁs-

years, W&L Director of Financial Aid
John DeCourcy said. Since 1988, na-

Although W&L’s enrollment has re-
mained stable, national enrollment rates
have increased and are expected to con-
tinue to expand. The U.S. Department
of Education projects enrollment to

the female “Rats.”

Gen. Bunting said that any changes
made for the women are “superficial”
and will not threaten or compromise
the nature of the institution.

“Many ofthe women wrote to me
and told me that if we changed any-
thing and made any concessions for
them, we would be insulting them,”
Bunting said.

One of the most noticeable changes
will be the end of the ten-year prac-
tice of shaving the “Rat’s” heads.
Other changes include shades for all
of the windows in the barracks, to be
used for changing purposes only, and
bathrooms with individual stalls and
doors for men and women.

Men’s showers will remain com-
munal, while the women will have
individual shower stalls.

dents must change their attitudes
toward alcohol before the admin-
istration can make any policy al-
terations.

At the meeting, Stanley stated
the focus of all discussion should
be on changing attitudes about
drinking. The students then broke
up into six groups to talk about
three main issues: why they were
at the meeting, how they would
change student attitudes toward al-

Colonel Michael Strickler said.
“There are certain times ofthe month
when women need their privacy.”

The Board of Visitors will decide
Wednesday on some particular regu-
lations concerning dating, fraterniza-
tion and makeup.

“I assume regulations about
makeup and dating will be a lot like
other military schools,” Bissell said.
This would mean no makeup or dat-
ing for the duration of the Rat line.
After that, Bissell thinks that women
will be allowed to wear conservative
makeup. Dating will probably be al-
lowed after the Rat line, but not within
the same company, Bissell said.

Most agree that the arrival of the
opposite sex will alter the character
and personality of the 158-year-old in-
stitution.

“I think it will change the person-
ality of VMI in ways that are impos-
sible to predict right now,” Bunting
said. “I don’t think the fundamental

cohol, and their suggestions to
modify W&L’s alcohol policy? Each
group wrote its responses on index
cards, which Stanley will compile in
a report and present to Dean Manning
and Dean Howison this week.

Some of the drinking alternatives
suggested include building the stu-
dent commons sooner, keeping the
GHQ open all night and sponsoring
Fridays! non-alcoholic events at fra-
ternity houses.

In addition to presenting the report
to the deans, Stanley has several other
ideas to create the “safest environ-
ment possible” for alcohol consump-

character, insofar as the military sys-
tem and the honor system, will
change.”

Bunting also thinks that the very
architecture of VMI will play- a- part
in the change. - 

“Not many people think about this,
but the single barrack building, where
all of the cadets live, is very signiﬁ-
cant,” Bunting said. “There are no
corridors, the doors are glass, and if
you stand in the middle ofthe court-
yard, you can see into every room.
With women there, this will alter the
ambience and texture oflife in the bar-
racks.”

Administrators foresee minor prob-
lems, especially in the first few weeks.

“VMI cadets have always been
taught to treat women as ladies. Now
they have to learn to treat them like
‘Rats,’” Strickler said. “This might
be a tough one to overcome.”

Bunting was in Toronto when he
heard the Supreme Court decision,

tion at W&L.

Her first idea is to create a bulle-
tin board in the dining hall that tar-
gets freshmen. The board would con-
tain all articles published about alco-
hol-related accidents at W&L, includ-
ing deaths.

Stanley also wants to compile a list
of upperclassmen‘s names for what
she calls a “Freshman List.” The list
would contain names ofstudents cat-
egorized according to how much they
drink: non-drinkers, moderate drink-
ers and responsible drinkers. The
names would be placed in freshman
orientation packets. The freshmen

was that the men‘s colleges should

sion, Bunting said. “The alumni ha‘_d\.

As for the cadets, they appers to

I Like Monkeys

http: //www2 . hawaii . edu/~pfunai/FUN/monkeys . html

This is only a text page that tells of a young man’s misadven-
tures when he purchases 200 cheap monkeys, but it is by far one
of the funniest things I have read in a long time. In my opinion,
though, this page is so much more than just a story. It offers
countless ideas that can be put to good use in everyday life such
as creative gift ideas for your friends next Christmas, inexpen-
sive ways to heat your dorm room this particularly cold May,
ways to maximize your use of empty freezer space and most im-
portantly proper toilet maintenance. I found this website to be
quite hilarious, but that might be because I like monkeys.

Websites of the Week

Have you ever wondered what Marge Simpson, Mr. Spock
or Liberace would look like if they were Chia pets? Well, if
you have, you either need to get out of the house more often
or come visit the Chia Pet Zoo where all your questions will
be answered. Although, this site is featured for the Chia Pet
Zoo, it offers so much more. Created by some guys who have
apparently spent a good amount of time driving around the
United States, this page offers two more great options, namely
Dead Fords and pictures of various road signs from around
the country. The Dead Fords link is quite obviously pictures
of dead Ford cars. I might have only found this amusing since
my own car, not a Ford, recently died on me. The other link
provides pictorial proof that most people on the highway are
pretty stupid and what might become the new spring break
destination for Washington and Lee students.

No, it’s not a page for witches dedicated to uses for frog tongues.
In reality, it is a page dedicated to a child’s toy or, more appropri-

As spring term rolls on and laying in the sun
at Goshen begins to get a little old, stu-
dents begin to ﬁnd other ways to ﬁll the lazy
days of May. One possible diversion is an
evening at Lime Kiln.

Founded in 1983, Lime Kiln is one ofthe
many historic sites in the Lexington area.
The 12-acre-site is set in a former kiln
which mainly supplied lime used in the
paper industry.

The three performance areas of Lime Kiln,
the Kiln, the Bowl and the Big Top Tent, used
in the event of rain, provide a beautiful set-
ting for the many dramas and musical events
taking place there. Dress is casual and guests
are invited to bring picnic baskets and relax
under the trees before the show.

This year’s schedule will feature 20 con-
certs and a variety of plays presented in one
of the most attractive settings in the
Shenandoah Valley.

Doug and Spos selected the la-

Before students pick up this introduction to Shakespeare, most
know the story of the two star-crossed lovers. The end, though,
disappoints some. Granted, the play would not be tragic if Romeo
and Juliet survived, but why, when Romeo left, did Juliet stay
behind? Why then concoct an elaborately faked death?

The Writing Center and the Career Development
and Placement Office will be sponsoring a joint ac-
tivity on Thursday at 3:30 p.m. in the Fairfax Lounge
of the University Center.

The program is titled “What Employers Want in
W&L Student Writing Ability.” Although this is not
the first event sponsored by the Writing Center, it is
the first time the CDPO has been invited to make a
presentation about writing skills and the job market,
a spokesperson for the ofﬁce said.

Director of the Writing Center Cary Smout got
the idea for this program from a writing tutor, the
spokesperson said. Smout then contacted Direc-
tor of Career Development and Placement Beverly
Lorig to set up the joint participation. The goal
was a presentation about writing resumes, cover
letters, presentations and samples for both the job
search and within jobs. The program also planned
to involve faculty.

The Career Development staff thought it a good
idea to share knowledge that incorporated writing with
employment. The presentation will feature Cheairs
Porter ’94 and members of the Career Development
staff. The Writing Center sponsors programs once
each term during the school year, and all students are
encouraged to attend and discover what an employer
wants in writing.

Rich man poor man

For some Washington and Lee students, free beer isn’t

nice, it’s a necessity.
‘i Several students we interviewed for our ﬁnancial aid story
this week were ashamed to give their names. Why? Is there
a social stigma attached to being poor at this school? What if
vou don’t drive a sport-utility vehicle, do not send your
Discover card bill to daddy or cannot afford to join a fraternity
or sorority?

Do you feel you’re looked down upon by your peers? No

’ ope doubts that it is hard to be at this school when you do not
have money. Yet more than one-third of the students here
receive some sort of financial aid. Students compensate by
working at local restaurants and stores, as well as work study
and other jobs on campus.

Yet no matter how many hours these students work, they
can’t achieve the material status quo here. That’s right, for
t ose of you who have not noticed, this is a school not only
0 brand name hard liquor, but clothes, cars, backpacks and
vacations. Beer is the one exception--everyone loves Natural

‘ So here’s the deal: stop trying. Show up on the hill in shoes

Teeter shopping bags that multiply under your sink, and buy
that PC Cola from Harris Teeter. It’s cheap.

‘(Four years at W&L are hard enough without worrying
about how much money your family has. Stop carrying this
chip on your shoulder. Do not max out your credit cards in an
attempt to keep up with your roommate. You will have
eiiough to deal with when those student loan payments start.
Being in debt is not a desirable trait to have. Take it from the

hard, very hard.

There are so many things that are more important than
money. The education we receive here is second to none. No

Where are all the fringe groups com-

called the Republic of Texas, an organization
which is l0,000 strong. They called on short-
wave radio for help from other countries,

Clearly they were being threatened by an
oppressive foreign power.

The RepublicotT exasaside,fringe groups
are becomingmuch more prevalent in society.

USA Today claims that this is merely due to a
spike in activity. Most of these groups seemed
to appear immediately following Timothy
McVeigh’s arrest. Since then, the public has
discovered that militia groupsexist allovcr the
country.

Are these groups really multiplying?
Maybe. There have been anti-tax, anti—gov-
emment groups since the early days of our
country. The Shay’s and Whiskey rebellions
of the 1780s and W905 were the ﬁrst. How-
ever, in today’s high-tech atmosphere, the
lntemet is becoming the perfect vehicle for
ﬁinge groups to spread their messages.

The beauty of the First Amendment is that
it allows any of these crazy people to publish
their ideas. Since no publishing house would
consider them, the lntemet is the best place for
these organizations to recruit members. It
gives them the ability to publish world—wide

there is always the trusty gun show.

Do these groups give Republicans a bad

conservative thinksthat, “A rocket launcher in
every home,” “Cut taxes to kill the poor,” and
“Govemment is the work of the Devil,” are

standard Republican rallying cries. They are
not. Weare Republicans, not Libertarians. But
as is the case with any group, the voice of the
minority dictates the perceived public opinion
of the group.

The Christian Coalition, the NRA, and the
militias give the average Republican a bad
name, much the same way the ACLU and the
Kennedy’s give Democrats a bad name.

Why do we listen to them? Because they
have interesting things to say. The moderates
of both parties, in whom most of the people in
this country believe, aren’t interesting, but the
radicals are.

The loudest people in politics are usually
the people who are wrong. Unfortunately,
they are also the hardest to ignore. The next
time these groups raise their heads to shout,
remember that they are not Republicans or
Democrats, but a fringe of crazy groups who
have always been and will always be with us.

about how various changes, such as
the hiringof Michelle Richardson as

Enlivening W&L’s boring old course guide

While registering for classes last week, I came upon a
shocking revelation: this school sucks. Interesting courses
are as few and far between as good jokes in Lietterrnarfs
monologue. So, Icame upwithafew suggestions forcourses
which may spice up the ol’ catalogue a bit:

This course examines one of the least appreciated genres of
literature ——the shopping list — by focusing on the works of
the Beat poets. Selections include Kerouac’s “Milk, a dozen
eggs, spaghetti and pasta sauce” and Ginsberg’s epic “Bread,
cheese, brussel sprouts, Kool Aid and LSD.”

Greek l0l — Fraternity life. Learn the Greek origins of

the Colonnade club

the fratemity system by reading the works of Drinkus,
Beerbongates, Alcoholius and Pukamides.
History 123 — The Civil War as we see it. This course
examines the Civil War as the South likes to imagine it
happened. Leamabout Lee’svictory at Gettysburg,Jackson’s
March to the Sea through New Jersey and other fabricated
facts. Note: Not for dadgum carpetbagging Yankees.
History 269—Presidentialsexscandals:Jacksonthrough
Wilson. The second part of thenaughty presidents survey.
Learn about Grover Cleveland’s luv shack by the Potomac,
Chester A. Arthur’s vast collections of women’s undergar-
ments and what Lincoln really used the Lincoln bedroom for.
Journalism 000 — The ﬁlms of Pauly Shore. A critical
look at how Shore combines plot, theme and dialogue to
create a wholly nauseating cinematic experience. Barfbags
will be provided for all screenings. Note: Students cannot
receive credits for both Journalism 000 and 00] (The Films

Garcia was honored at a banquet
Friday night by receiving the Arthur
Ashe Sportsman of the Year award.
“I was not expecting it at all,” said
Garcia, “I wasjust surprised to see my
name on the list.”

“It is such a big award for
Natalia,” commented Rankin, “It’s
amazing how many people came up
to me and told me what a wonderful
person she is.”

Garcia was also named to the Aca-
demic All-American team. The team
as a whole received Academic All-
American status with over a 3.2 GPA.

W&L cruised in the ﬁrst round,
beating Pomona 8-1. Garcia dropped
Claire Turchi, a previous singles na-
tional champion, in three sets 6-4, 5-
7, 7-5. “I knew I had to play her, and
I knew I had nothing to lose,” said
Garcia. “Not being nervous helped
me a lot.”

The Generals swept the remaining
singles matches against Pomona, and

only dropped the second flight
doubles match.

In the quarterﬁnals, the Generals
beat Gustavus Adolphus 6-3. The top
three ﬂights for the Generals, Garcia,
juniors Berry Blankinship and Ericka
Shapard, and the sixth ﬂight player
freshman Erin Eggers picked up
singles wins. The doubles teams of
Garcia and freshman Brook Hartzell,
as well as Blankinship and Shapard
won for the Generals.

The demanding schedule of the
championships hurt the Generals in
the semi-ﬁnals. W&L lost to Kenyon
for the second time this year 6-3.

“It was extremely hot on Tuesday.
All the teams were tired,” said Rankin.
“Their bye kicked in. It really makes
a difference.”

Nevertheless, Garcia picked up her
third win of the championships over
Caryn Cuthbert of Kenyon 6-0, 6-1.
Only Eggers picked up another singles
win for the Generals. Blankinship and

Shapard won their doubles match.
The loss placed W&L against num-
ber three seed Emory University in the
third place match. Kenyon went on
to win the national championship

“For W&L and Emory it was a
very important match,” said Rankin.
“We wanted to see who the best team
in the south region was.”

Emory’s own bye kicked in, but the
Generals were barely knocked off 5-
4. Garcia. Shapard and Eggers won
in singles, and Blankinship and
Shapard won their doubles match.
The match came down to
Blankinship’s singles match.

“Everyone else had ﬁnished, and
she was still playing the second set,”
said Rankin, “she just kept plugging
away at it.” Her opponent, Katie
Kirchbaum, won the ﬁrst set 6-3.

Blankinship struggled back to take
the second set to pick up a 6-4 vic-
tory. Kirchbaum proved to be too
much, taking the third set 6-2.

THE BIG FAN

BY Scorr BOOKWALTER

You might think the NBA playoff teams
are the ones making the most headlines. Maybe
not, because the coaching carousel for the non-
playoff teams is already in full swing.

While the playoff teams are slogging
through the second round, teams like the
Celtics, Sixers and Pacers are hoping to get
back there someday by hiring big-name
coaches. Kentucky coach Rick Pitino, who was
also wooed by the Philadelphia 76ers, left to
coach the Boston Celtics. Celtic legend Larry
Bird accepted the coaching job for the Indi-
ana Pacers. Ex-Pacers coach Larry Brown took
control of the 76ers.

The good news about Pitino’s hiring is that
we ﬁnally get to stop hearing the annual Pitino-
to-the-NBA rumors. He almost took a job with
the Nets last year after they promised him con-

trol of everything at the Meadowlands except
for Jimmy Hoffa’s body. This year he was ﬁ-
nally offered a job that was too good to resist-
a $70 million contract to coach basketball’s
most storied franchise.

Pitino (who, incidentally, resembles John
Cusack of “Grosse Pointe Blank”) is coming
home in a sense. He started his coaching ca-
reer at Boston University and moved onto
Providence, where he led the Friars to the 1987
Final Four. He did dip into the NBA for a short
stay with the New York Knicks but soon left
to coach a Kentucky team that was coming
off of probation. The rest is history.

Everywhere Pitino goes, he wins. There is
no doubt he will do the same in Boston, but
how fast? This is a city already fed up with the
Red Sox and Bruins’ mediocrity and probably

. won’t have the patience for any ﬁve-year plans.

A And it might take that long. Pitino does
inherit one of his old Kentucky stooges in
Antoine Walker, but has little else of value.

Getting Tim Duncan would help, but then
again any lottery player would help. Pitino,
though, is known for his ability to maximize

Italent. He probably did his best coaching job
last season when he led an injury-riddled Ken-
tucky team to the NCAA title game.

The irony of Bird’s hiring in Indiana is that
the Celtics were considering naming him as
coach until Pitino’s name surfaced. Even af-
ter they hired Pitino, Rick tried to keep Bird as
general manager. But Larry knew that his
power would be diminished with Pitino call-
ing most of the shots. So he returned to his
home state, where he is more popular than even
Damon Bailey, to coach that other Indiana
team, the Pacers.

Bird will win faster than Pitino simply be-
cause he has more to work with. Indiana was
inconsistent and underachieving last season
and Bird will have to reteach thejump shot to
Reggie Miller before the Pacers can return to
the playoffs.

Larry Brown should qualify for frequent-
ﬂyer status as many places as has been. Brown
once coached the Clippers, but judging by the
current condition of the Sixers, they could be j
even more challenging. The Sixers have plenty '
of potential when they’re not shooting them-
selves in the foot and could rise quickly under
a disciplinarian like Brown. Discipline is what»
the Sixers need most since Derrick Coleman"
shows up for practices when he feels like it,
Allen Iverson and Jerry Stackhouse ﬁght each
other (literally) for shots, and Scott Williams
is the starting center. 7

In fact, the Sixers haven’t had a real center
since Moses Malone left. Brown’s job is ac-
tually quite simple. Trade Coleman for a
couple cheese steaks, turn Iverson into a real,“
point guard, hope the team gets lucky enough
to draft Duncan and then convince the Philly
media that the team is moving in the right di-
rection. Just another day at the ofﬁce, right,
Larry? Larry?

and was actively involved with St. Patrick’s Catholic
Church. VMI held a memorial service for him 5 p.m.
Thursday in Jackson Memorial Hall.

While heart attacks in young people are uncommon,
they are not impossible. In the fall of 1995, Olympic
champion ice skater Sergei Grinkov, 28, suffered a heart
attack while rehearsing a routine.

Often, when someone young dies ofa heart attack,
the problem can be traced to a genetic disorder or an
independent disease that affects the heart. An un-
healthy diet high in cholesterol and a relatively seden-

Lexington has lost another college freshman.

Early in the morning, Saturday, May 1 1, a Virginia
Military Institute freshman died in his sleep ofa heart
attack caused by coronary blockage around 5 a.m.
Nathan John Kowrach, 19, was visiting the home of
“Brother Rat” Edwin L. Clarke at Fort McNair in Wash-
ington, D.C. The students were between exams and
the time they had to be back for the New Market Day
activities and graduation.

After staying up Saturday night playing board
games, the cadets slept late the next morning. Although
Clarke and another student, Ryan Mahoney, woke up
between 11:30 a.m. and noon, they did not go in to
wake Kowrach until 1 p.m., at which point they dis-
covered he was dead.

“Only extensive testing could have discovered the prob-
lem before Kowrach had the heart attack,” Director of Pub-
lic Relations Colonel Michael Strickler said.

Kowrach, a history major, was from Benton Harbor,
Michigan. He was a member of Hotel Company at VMI

tack at an early age.

The American Heart Association has warned of
several likely signs that one is suffering from a heart
attack. The signs include uncomfortable pressure;
fullness; squeezing; pain in the center of the chest
lasting longer than a few minutes; pain spreading
to the shoulders, neck, or arms and chest discom-
fort combined with lightheadedness, fainting, nau-
sea or shortness of breath. People can also experi-
ence these symptoms after a strenuous workout,
though, and can miss the warnings.

of a faculty residence collapsed yesterday.

The incident occurred 15 minutes before the

Cadets steal
alumni flags

BY DAVID BALSLEY
PHI EDITORIAL EDITOR

Thanks to a recent act
of vandalism by three
Virginia Military Insti-
tute cadets, the Washing-
ton and Lee campus has
recently become a little
bit cleaner. .

The cadets were caught
taking some ofW&L’s blue
and white alumni flags
around midnight April 30. Ca-
dets have customarily taken the
ﬂags every year since the deco-
rations were first introduced
five years ago.

“I personally ii
observed them take
flags from our
poles,” W&L Di-
rector of Security
Michael Young
said. “I called for
assistance and we
ran them down.”

On May 12,
three VMI seniors
began to perform
community service here as part
of their punishment under the
supervision of W&L Security
and Traffic Control Officer
Thomas “Baner” Bane.

“They spent part of one
day painting curbs around the
Woods Creek apartments and
the law school and cleaned
the Woods Creek apartments
one day,” Young said.

While some consider
the practice to be a serious
act of vandalism, Others
dismiss it as little more
than a prank. An anony-
mous VMI cadet described
the Inost recent theft as a
“practical joke."

Ipersonally
observed
them take
ﬂags from
our poles.

Michael Young,
Director of Security

“They were going to
return them. There was
nothing malicious about
it.”

Whether a destruc-
tive crime or a harmless
joke, the administration
ofVM1 and the security
staff of W&L have both
responded strongly to
the practice.

VMI found the actions
of the three cadets to be
serious enough to merit
a number one penalty,
the institution‘s most se-
rious punishment short
of suspension or expul-
sion. VMIpun-
ished the three
cadets by
awarding them
a 30 hour pen-
alty tour, 30
hours of commu-
nity service and
confinement to
their barracks
until graduation,

,’ Young said.

“I guess it’s kind oflike
being in jail,” Young said.

Young has re-
sponded to the most ‘re-
cent theft by taking
steps to ensure that no
alumni ﬂags will be sto-
len in the future. He re-
turned the cadets to
VMI with instructions
to warn their fellow
classmates that they
will be arrested if they
attempt to take any-
thing from the W&L
campus in the future.

“if we catch them
again,“ Young said. “well
put them injail.“

IFC considers
risk management

BY KATHRYN MAYURNIK
PHI NEWS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee rumor
mill is at it again.

Ever since the lnterfraternity
Council met last Monday with fra-
ternity house presidents in a closed
forum meeting, rumors about exten-
sive curbing ofthe W&L drinking
scene have been ripping through
campus. But nothing like that is
going to happen.

The IFC and the fraternity presi-
dent did meet last week to discuss new
ways to address alcohol concerns.
Changes will be made, but nothing has
been decided yet.

“Students will have to adapt to a
new policy,” IFC member Colin
Connolly said. “But it won’t be
anything that drastic that will com-
pletely alter the W&L social scene.
In no way is IFC or the school go-
ing to outlaw drinking.”

Fraternity presidents were given a
week to discuss risk management with
their houses after last Monday’s meet-
ing. They will meet with the IFC and
Pi Kappa Phi National President Mark
Timmes today. Timmes is also a law-
yer who specializes in fraternal liabil-
ity and risk.

“After this meeting. some defini-
tive policy might be decided on,”1FC
President Jason Callen said. “But it
might not be until next fall.”

The policy change relies on the
decisions ofthe fraternity presidents,
Callen said. In the end, they will have
the ﬁnal vote on the issue.

“It's always good for the IFC to
review policy every now and then and
review the present policy,” Callen
said. “We’re looking to address two
questions. ‘Does it protect fratemi-
ties liability wise and does it protect
the students who go to the parties?’”

The rain poured down as al-
most 500 people filed into Lee
Chapel last week for Jack
Bowden’s memorial service last
Wednesday. Bowden’s parents
were in attendance, along with
their 27-year-old daughter Jenni-
fer and her husband.

The haunting sounds of the
University Chamber Singers per-
forming “Lay A Garland” filled
Lee Chapel with a sense of peace
and closure to this tragedy.

“I think that the service ful-
filled the need for individuals to
express sorrow for this tragedy,”
Dean of Students David
Howison said.

Readings from the Old and
New Testament were given by
Beta Theta Pi President Tom
Fallace and Catholic Campus
Minister William “Burr” Datz
’75. Freshman Daniel Hayes,
one of Bowden’s best friends
and pledge brothers, delivered a
speech that attempted to capture
Bowden’s youth and exuber-
ance. Hayes stressed the impor-
tance of fraternal bonds in his
friendship with Bowden.

A memorial service for Jack Bowden was held in Lee

Hayes said. “Jack shined during
pledgeship.”

Hayes cited that some of his
fondest memories of Bowden in-
cluding smoking cigars in the fresh-
man quad, watching girls in the
Dining Hall and the way Jack would
dance in his distinctive way at ev-
ery fraternity party on campus.

“We were a bunch of guys who
liked to have a good time,” Hayes
said. “At the beginning of the year,
Jack was on top of the world, and
the rest of us were there with him.”

Bowden was planning on major-
ing in Spanish and was going to try
out for the tennis team in the fall,
Hayes said later in an interview.

Dr. and Mrs. Bowden have
shown an extraordinary support for
Washington and Lee, Howison
said. “I think that is what had sus-
tained them,” Howison said.

The Bowdens are setting up
a memorial fund in their son’s
memory. It has not yet been
determined what the money
will be used for. They will
return in the fall to plant a tree
on campus for Jack.

Friday, May 30. This original perfomance will be an integration ofthe
plays on the same stage as part of the same show, adding an additional
layer of discourse to the production. “Theater lovers will ﬁnd some-
thing for all tastes...who knows, maybe they will pick up some French
along the way,” Professor Radulescu said. The two plays have been
translated into many languages and performed on stages throughout the
world. They illustrate the human condition and man’s basic relation-
ship with his fellow mortals. All shows begin at 8 p.m. in the Johnson
Theater of the Lenfest Center. Admission is free, and the public is in-
vited to attend.

ALUMS PRESENT BENEFIT CONCERT

Robert Vienneau ’87, ’90L, a pianist popular with Lexington audi-
ences, will present a concert on Wednesday, May 21, at 8:30 p.m. in

Cafe au Lait is a high-speed, high-spirited comedy about race and ro-
mance in the Parisian melting pot.

“Ma Saison Preferee” is a powerfully unsettling ﬁlm which gives us
characters full of surprising reverberations and behavior that can’t be
psychologically ﬁxed or neatly resolved. Both ﬁlms are in French with
English subtitles. The public is invited to attend and admission is free
of charge.

HONORS THESIS PRESENTATIONS

E. Lucinda Barnett and Kathy Lu will present their senior honors
theses on Thursday, May 22, at 3 p.m. in Reid Hall, room 108. Bamett’s

We arrived just before

but slightly low to the ground—
Robin felt she needed a booster

began to pour outside, but in-
side the diner the mood re-

ained cheerful and bright.

We started with an appe-
tizer, the Brew City Fries,
which were well-seasoned
without being excessively
srpicy. To drink we chose
milkshakes: vanilla for Doug
and chocolate for Robin.

The shakes arrived in tall,

We admired the colorful Elvis decor while sip-

Robin chose the Elvis Burger, a double-decker

most as enjoyable.

Meanwhile, Doug opted for
the Pink Cadillac’s unique prime

for $5.95 to 100 ounces for
$100.95. Doug selected 12
ounces, with a baked potato and
fried apples on the side. He raved
about the prime rib and rapidly

The pitch: “lt'|| be like ‘Say Anything’ meets ‘The Professlona|.’"

BY ALEX CHRISTENSEN
Pit/1MovIE CRITIC

John Cusack is a smart man.
I; More than that, he’s a ﬁne ac-

II tor—see “Better Off Dead,”

“Spy Anything,” “The Grifters.”
So why has he recently been rel-
egated to bit parts? It’s a ques-
tion there’s no good answer for.

Apparently, Cusack himself
couldn’t think of a good an-
swer either, so he took a page
from independent ﬁlmmaking,
-rodlhded up some friends and
colleagues and wrote and pro-
uced a ﬁlm with a wonderful
role for him to showcase his
owp numerous talents.
"Grosse Pointe Blank” (un-
fortunate title) is the story of
Martin Q. Blank, a professional
‘pl it man who is undergoing a life
risﬁs. The professional killing
usiness is becoming compli-
.ated because of the interfer-
nce of fellow hitter “Grocer”
‘Dan Aykroyd, hilarious),

uce.what can turn into very

society, why would you want
a boss?

To further stir up Martin’s
angst, his therapist, Dr. Oatman
(Alan Arkin, brilliant), is so ner-
vous about having a profes-
sional killer for a patient that
he’s no longer helping Martin.
“Did you ever think that some
of your problems might stem
from the fact that you keep kill-
ing people?” Now it’? .ime for
Martin’s ten-year high school
reunion, which brings up a
whole other boatload of issues.

Returning to Grosse Pointe to
complete a hit and attend his re-
union, Martin discovers you can’t
go home again, meets his old girl-
friend Debi (Minnie Driver) and
ﬁnally ﬁgures out what’ s important
to him. It’s not as pat as all that,
and the whole point of Grosse
Pointe Blank is to watch great ac-
tors riff on life, death, killing for
money, and midlife crises.

In addition to Cusack,
Aykroyd, Arkin, and Driver,
Cusack’s sister Joan shows up
as Blank’s secretary, and Jeremy
Piven (ofTV’s “Ellen”) is great
as an old high school chum. It’s
not just one-liners and over-the-
top situations, though those are
there as well. Martin Blank feels
real, and the situations he gets
into build and build until you’re
not just watching a movie with
a neat structure and efﬁcient
pacing, but one that completely
draws you in so you need to see
what’s going to happen next.

Director George Armitage is
very smart. He stays out of the
actors’ business, shoots the ac-
tion like action, very cleverly,

in fact, and generally makes sure
that nothing gets in John
Cusack’s way.

I’m not sure exactly why, but
Cusack’s acting ﬁlls up a lot of
holes and inconsistencies in
“Grosse Pointe Blank” so that it
all seems to come together be-
lievably (in context). It has
something to do with perceiv-
ing that Cusack is extremely in-
telligent and always on top of
things. You get the feeling that
he gets it, and it creates an in-
credible audience identiﬁcation
with him, however outrageous
the character he is portraying.
I get the feeling that nobody
else could quite have pulled
off the complexities and
quirks of the role of Martin
Blank to create such an enter-
taining, funny film.

In fact, Cusack’s perfor-
mance really transcends
“Grosse Pointe Blank” to such
an extent that thoughts of Tom
Hanks in Big or Steve Martin in
Roxanne pop up. Hopefully, the
success ofthis ﬁlm will similarly
put Hollywood on notice notjust
that Cusack can bring in the
bucks, but that he can deliver
dead-on perfonnances in a vari-
ety ofmajor “leading man” roles.
He’sjust ajoy to watch perform.

“Grosse Pointe Blank” is a
black comedy which crass-proofs
itself. lfyou didn’t laugh in Pulp
Fiction, stay away. If you’re of-
fended by disrespect for human
life being played for laughs. this
is not for you. Otherwise, grab
your popcorn and head in for one
ofthe most original ﬁlms you’ll
see this year.

 Get out!

Why are you just sitting there? Yeah, until now
Spring Term has been rainy and basically a huge drag,
but now we can actually view the sun. The highs
recently have been in the 80s and it is gorgeous outside.
So get off your ass and take advantage of it!

There are many things to do around our
humble Lexington to attract the die-hard
otltdoorsy type or the person who just likes to
take a hike every once in a while. Of course,
everyone knows where Goshen is, and if you
have not made a venture out there at least once
lpring spring term you just are not a W&L
V tudent. But what else is there?

Take a drive past Buena Vista up to the Blue
‘ Fdge Parkway and turn either north or south to
‘ .1d amazing views as well as great hiking trails.
here are places where you can park your car
-nd take a short hike to a lake placed a little
». uvay back from the road.

Did you know that there are rivers out there
0 er than the Maury? The James and the
Roanoke flow close by and can be reached with a
short car ride. Canoeing, kayaking and tubing
are great on a hot day. Just think of lazing in a
raft ﬂoating in cool water rather than doing that
Linear Algebra. The Outing Club will teach you
how to kayak. See that phone? Pick it up... call
for information... do it.

In the mood to do some caving? The karst
limestone that covers this area carves out
cairerns that are just begging to be explored. Go
do some spelunking. The Outing Club actually
will teach you how to do this, too. (Another plug
for the Outing Club. Shameless, aren't I?) It

e 11 sets up trips to local caves to take just this
-4 ind of adventure.

So you want to stay on the ground? Take up
mountain biking. You can hop on that sucker
and take off. Go explore the woods behind the
Law School and some of the country roads
around here. If VMI was still in session you
could try to mow down some cadets. Go ahead
and perfect your form so you can take up this
new variation in the fall.

‘lThere are so many things to do that you have
no excuses to still be sitting there reading this.
Look outside the window -- the sun is calling
you. Set down those books for an hour or two
a take off. Your professors will forgive you,
'ust tell them the Phi made you do it.

Turning a liberal eye to
W&L campus politics

Since this is my last column ofthe year,
I thought I would end with a few thoughts
that have been ﬂoating around my mind for
the past couple of months. I was recently
illuminated by a friend’s offhand comment:
“I read your column when it’s not about

From the Left
Laura Knapp ’99

politics.” I had to laugh; my column is
always about politics. Honestly, besides the
Hollywood-esque glamour of working for
the Phi, my original intent in writing “From
the Left” was to provide a counterpoint to
those entrenched W&L/conservative views
and maybe win

over a few con- ‘ ‘

deavor—at least so far. Even I could be
labeled “Exhibit A” of this failure; I am
spending my summer working for my Re-
publican congresswoman. Have I done such
a poor job that I have converted myself from
liberalism? Or maybe I just suffer from
diffusion—<:oncentration of a high degree
of Republicanism toa lowerdegree? Hardly.
I would still support Ralph Naderover Newt
Gingrich and free hypodermic needles to
heroin users to stop the spread of AIDS
every day and twice on Sundays.

Butback to my original point: it is impos-
sible to change anyone’s mind unless people
actually read what I write. So here’s my big
epiphany: don’t write about politics. To
those students outside the politics depart-

ment who scurry around the science build-
ing, discussion

eral cause in the

matters are not important to W&L students; in
a recent interview for a position on the Contact
Committee, I commented that there is simply a
lack of activeness——-political or otherwise——on
campus. Of course, I was rebuffed by the EC,
so maybe I am wrong, but I think that most
W&Lstudents don’t feel too strongly about too
much. Students don’t even feel strongly about
conservative subjects. For example: There are
over 200 members of the College Republican
Club. Do you ever hear about their activities?
Why not? We are all wasting away in our
inactivity and passiveness. We are young and
damn smart, and we have the world before us.
We have the ability to effect great change. So
why don’t we?

We need to get active. Let’s havea Right-to-

Life rally on the Hill. At least it's a sign of life!
One of the most fascinating events on campus
this year was the Miller vs. Christensen debate.

The sheer number of people who attended was .

amazing and the event was not even school-
sponsored. Students simply came out to hear
and consider both sides because they were
interested and not because a professor made
them. Unfortunately, Alex did a disservice to
those supposed “subversive” elements of the
campus by being unprepared. But wouldn’t it
be great if we could have that type of critical-
thinking exercise more often?

Before it is too late, before we all gooff to be
doctors, lawyers and investment bankers, Iet’s
get active. Let’s get involved. Let’sstand up for
what we believe.

Improving the Phi

We here at The Ring-tum Phi have ﬁnally realized that our paper is pretty
darn lousy. But don’tblame us...blameourparents. My psychiatrist certainly
does. Anyway, the point is that we’re not going down without a ﬁght. We’re
working to make our paper better, better even than that other one. (I’m
referring, of course, to The Washington Post.) Here are a few of the new

The Looney Bin

Kevin McManemin ’00

features to watch for in upcoming issues:

Grossly inaccurate weather forecasts. Snow in May. 98 degrees and
slight chance of tornado in the middle of January. You’ll never know what
we’ll make up for the week’s wacky weather in the Phi.

Unfounded rumors. Which deans are sleeping with which freshmen this
week? What circus animals are going into the vats at the D-hall? Which
member of the Math Department just married Princess Di? Hey, they may
not be true, but you’ll have loads of fun reading these lies.

Stupid headlines. Just wait until you see what we have in store: “Mean
Dean Seen In Keen Jeans,” “Savvy Sophomore Sells Seven Seats to
Shakespeare Stage Show” and “This Week, Greek Freaks and Meek Geeks
Seek to Sneak Peaks at Roof Leaks.” That’s right, the content of articles will
no longer matter, as long as the author can come up with a rhyming and/or
alliterative headline.

Apathetic political columnkts. No matter what’s going on in the crazy
world of politics, you can count on one thing: our political columnists won’t
give a rat’s ass. Left wing, right wing, it’s all just a bunch of meaningle$
claptrap to these guys. They don’t keep up on the news, so if you want
indifferent opinions on last year’s headlines, look no further than the Phi.

Better pictures. Soon we’ll print the ﬁrst of our “scratch and sniff’

Letter to the editor:

Dear Phi Editors,

On the front page of last week’s Phi, you ran
an article about a study on educational funding
done by that vigilant environmental and con-
sumer watchdog, the U.S. Public Interest Re-
search Group (U.S. PIRG). For the past three
summers, I have had the privilege of working for
the state PIRGS through their national campaign
network, The Fund for Public Interest Research
(generally referred to as “the Fund”). The Fund
is the largest grassroots campaign network in the
country, and this summer, they will be running
offices for groups like the PlRGs, the Sierra Club
and the Audubon Society. Working for them has
been the most rewarding job experience I’ve ever
had. I’m writingto tell other W&L students about
job opportunities available through the Fund and
to tell my fellow classmates why they should
consider working in the ass-kicking non-profit
community while they are still young and able to
enjoy working hard for something they love.

The most compelling reason to work forthe
Fund is because right now our environment and
the nation’s health are in trouble. Half of our
lakes and a third of our rivers are too polluted to
fish or swim in. Millions of Amereican breathe
air every day that doesn’t meet minimum health
standards. Unfortunately, special interests give
millions of dollars every year to our Congress to
weaken our environmental laws. That’s ridicu-
lous. So how does this whole job thing work?

I started working for the Fund as a political
canvasser during the summer of 1994. As a
political canvasser, I spent my afternoons and
evenings engaged in the radical act of going door-
to-door and actually talking to people I’d never
met before about environmental protection. This

might seem like a crazy thing to do, but it turns
out that canvassing is not only a whole hell of a

lot easier than it looks (since the Fund has .7. great \,

training program), but it’s also a lot of fun. I met

lots of really great people, I got concerned citi-; E

zens involved in the environmental movement, I

learned how to effectively and succinctly com- 
municate ideas, and I learned a lot about how
democracy works. And I made enough money to

buy a car.

Sound like fun? It was. So much so that I
returned the following summer as the Assistant, .
Director ofthe Indianapolis Sierra Club ofﬁce. I ‘

was twenty years old during my first summer as
a director. I couldn’t legally drink alcohol, but I
was able to meet with members of Indiana’s
congressional delegation, organize and conduct
a televised press conference, run petitioning tables
at rock concerts, and most importantly, I was able
to recruit and train a citizen outreach staff that
added over a thousand new members to the
Indiana chapter of the Sierra Club. These are the
kinds of experiences available to you through the
Fund, and believe you me, they look mighty darn
impressive on a resume. You can also feelgood
about the work you’re doing. Plus you’re work-
ing with other intelligent and motivated young
people who are sincerely dedicated to and enthu-
siastic about their jobs.

If you’re interested in ﬁnding out more about
the Fund and the jobs available for the summer
campaign season, you should call their toll-free
number 1-800-75-EARTH. Working for the
Fund has taught me to be a better leader, a better
organizer and a better citizen. I can’t recommend
the experience highly enough, especially since
they gave me a paying job after graduation.

Sincerely,

Young was surprised at the idea of a men’s

an idea is not impossible. A men’s program
could be started in the future if a demand for it
existed.

V R.A.D. is a defense program that operates na;

them escape venues when a rape situation arises.“

 softball valuable for future

 BIG FAN

BY Scorr BOOKWALTER

I have never been a big advocate
of our PE requirements here. While
it is important to keep in shape, three
or four classes should be plenty to
fulﬁll a PE requirement, not ﬁve.

It is annoying to schedule them
around our regular class schedules,
particularly in the fall and winter
terms. It is also ludicrous that inter-
collegiate athletes are not exempt
from taking other classes to fulﬁll the
requirements, since they practice
longer at their sports than we do at
our regular PE classes. And don’t get
me started on the registration process.
f With that said, I’ll have to admit
that the PE classes I have taken thus
far have beneﬁtted me immensely.
My volleyball and tennis skills im-
proved tremendously after taking
those classes.

This term I am taking softball
along with’ 80-90 other people and it
has been by far my funniest PE class.
It helps to be on a good team, and I’d

like to thank my terriﬁc teammates
Ericka Snyder (our captain and speedy
lead-off hitter), Seth Kellerman, Jon
Wright, David Ledlie, Pete
Hammond, Chris Higgs, Taryn
Kiekow, Kevin Alexander and
Tommy Dudley for carrying us this
far while I try to shake the rust off
from not playing competitive softball
in several years. (OK, I’m really not
that great, but it sounds better to say
I’m still rusty.) But at least I’m im-
proving, which is a direct result of tak-
ing this class, and it is clear the others
are improving their skills too.

After losing on opening day, we
have won ﬁve straight games head-
ing into the playoffs next week. The
fabled PE softball championship tro-
phy would certainly look good next
to my Pony League baseball trophy if
we can make it that far. Or maybe the
A+ in the class, which as Coach
Cerone pointed out, could be the dif-
ference between summa cum laude
and magna cum laude. There are
some lessons to be learned from this
class and softball in general.

First, it helps to have some heavy

lumber in your lineup because soft-
ball games are always high-scoring
and no lead is ever safe. We have won
games by football scores such as 28-
27, 27-24 and 22-21.

Second, it takes a lot of guts to
pitch. After seeing a pitcher nearly
get killed the other day after a line
drive slammed into his face, that real-
ization hit home. Also, hitting
grounders in softball isn’t necessarily
a bad thing, since inﬁelders can have
a tough time playing tricky hops on
the bumpy ﬁelds.

So what’s my point to all this?
Take the softball PE class if you
haven’t already and bring a catcher’s
mask and pads if you want to pitch.
You will hopefully ﬁnd the competi-
tion and atmosphere as fun as I have.
As much as we may complain about
taking PE classes, the athletic skills
we learn now will pay dividends for
the rest ofour lives, unlike Calculus
II.

If nothing else, we can show up our
co-workers at company picnics with
an athletic ability other than lifting
beer cans.

W&L graduates look
to bright future

BY DOUGLAS BRowN &
ROBIN SEATON
PHI STAFF WRITERS

What does the future have in
store for you? For gradu
ating seniors the world is filled
with amazing opportunities and
scary realities.

At this time last year, 56 percent
of the 1996 graduating class were ei-
ther employed or accepted to gradu-
ate or professional schools. Six
months after graduation that number
rose to 97.3 percent.

“The job market is actively
seeking qualified college gradu-
ates at this time,” Amy Hitlin of
Career Development and Place-
ment said.

Although Career Development
has not finished compiling data
collected for the class of 97, they
expect the employment numbers
to be similar to those for the class
of ’96. g‘

“The trends have
stayed the same for
the past few years,”
Hitlin said.

“The ratios are better at top
programs,” Keen said. “One
way to enhance your chances of
finding ajob is to come from a
top program.”

This year a select group of
Washington and Lee students
has been accepted into out-
standing graduate programs.

Seniors Jason Shaffer and
Elizabeth Fritze will both at-
tend Yale in the fall. Shaffer
will be pursuing his Ph.D. in
British literature, and Fritze
will be working towards her
law degree.

“I still can’t believe they
took me,” Shaffer said.

When asked if there was any
chance ofromantic involvement
between the two soon—to—be

denied any possibility. Fritze
said she has already received

Spending craze comes to halt

BY B.J. WALKER
PHI STAFF WRITER

There is no need to spend money
furiously in the Co—op anymore.

After weeks of confusion and
various proposals, the University
has reached a decision about what
will happen to the balance that re-
mains on students food debit ac-
counts. According to John Cuny,
Washington and Lee’s Associate
Treasurer and Controller of the
Business Office, any remaining
money will be transferred out ofthe
food debit account at the end of the
year and applied to the general debit
account. A refund check will then
be sent out for the balance.

By refunding the money, W&L is
violating Virginia law prohibiting re-
turning any money placed in such an
account. Technically, the money is in
a board plan account and thus not sub-
ject to the 8.5% state tax on food.

Originally, this was designed to
give the students a break, allowing
them to make food purchases with-
out having to pay the tax. In fact, the
contract students signed stated that,

“you also save 8.5% tax by partici-
pating In one ofthese programs.”

The problem arises from the fact
that funds in such a tax-free account
are not legally transferable to stu-
dents. If the W&L goes ahead with
the plan to give back the money, it
faces severe ﬁnes from the state.

The controversy over the account
arose when students began receiving
letters at the beginning of April indi-
cating that they had money left on
their card, in some cases hundreds of
dollars and that it must be used by the
end of May. Ifthey did not spend the
money, it would become property of
the university. To most students en-
rolled in the meal plan this news came
as a surprise.

“There was a small printing of in-
formation describing what would
happen to the money, but it wasn’t
publicized very well,” Cuny said. In
fact, the contract which students
signed at the beginning of the year
made no reference to the refund
policy. The only mention came in a
brochure sent along with the contract,
which some students claim to have
never seen.

“I think most students just as-
sumed that they would be getting a

refund or the money would be trans-
ferred to another of their accounts,”

Cuny said. Several students pro-
tested, saying it was unfair and
deceptive for the university not to
refund the money.

While the illegality of the refund
is certain, the administration insists
that the refund is the correct and
moral thing to do.

“Our decision was based on the
lack of communication,” Cuny said.
“We realize that most students were
unaware ofthe policy and would ap-
preciate getting their money back.
Wejust want to do what is right and
best for the students.”

For some students, however,
the announcement comes too late.
Several students have gone to ex-
treme measures to use up the re-
maining money on their cards be-
lieving that otherwise the money
would go to waste.

Sophomore Becca Harris was un-
aware that her parents had put sev-
eral hundred dollars on her card.

“I bought three cases of Snapple,
16 subs for a picnic, and I came home
everyday with enough M&M’s to ﬁll

“Ifwe can reach all aspects of campus, that will start a

domino effect,” Kanner said.

‘ X I ouldn’t it be nice to live in a place where ev

eryone got along regardless of their differences?

A new student organization, Programming for

the Respect of Individuals and Diversity in Education,

hopes to address the issue of racial, ethnic, religious, gen-
der and lifestyle diversity at Washington and Lee.

“In the fall, we started planning for a group to address
the issue of improving the W&L community through diver-
sity,” Dean Anece McCloud said.

Three students were chosen to lay the groundwork
for the group. Twelve other students were selected to
become a part of the central committee of P.R.I.D.E.
based on their leadership abilities and their commit-
ment to a wide variety of organizations on campus. The
group includes athletes, Greeks, independents and in-
ternational students.

“Each group member is enthusiastic about mak-
ing W&L more diverse,” P.R.I.D.E. member Will-
iam Kanner said.

The mission of P.R.I.D.E. closely follows Robert E.
Lee’s call for “gentlemanly conduct.”

“Everyone brings a type of diversity to this campus,”
McCloud said. “It is important that we listen to each other
with open minds. In order to have a community where we

P.R.I.D.E. hopes to sponsor a Diversity Festival in the
coming year.

“Various student organizations will be repre-
sented,” McCloud said. “They’ll each do something
to display American diversity and culture.”

P.R.I.D.E. members will target Greek organiza-
tions, the Minority Student Association, the Execu-
tive Committee and other campus groups.

McCloud envisions a variety of speeches, cos-
tumes and dances representing different lifestyles
and cultures.

“We don’t want to exclude anyone. P.R.I.D.E.
is an inclusive organization,” McCloud said.

P.R.I.D.E. plans to host additional events in the
future. “Our objective this year was to get the orga-
nization in place,” McCloud said.

“We’d like to encourage activities to get people to
know each other more,” Kanner said.

“P.R.I.D.E. is an ongoing project,” McCloud em-
phasizes. “Those who are members at this point in
time are expected to be lifetime members. Our alumni
group will keep everyone at W&L abreast ofwhat goes
on in the real world, and hopefully, they will take some
ofthe things that they have learned out to society.”

Websites of the Week

BY MATTHEW CRAIG
PHI STAFF WRITER

Summer is almost here. That means summer jobs
and enormous amounts of free time -- compared to
the rest of the year. I thought that as a community
service I would provide you with some sites dedi-
cated to the wasting of time. Of course, I do that
every week, but who cares? Anyway, here are some
sites that will give you something to do while you’re
sitting at home or work with nothing to do.

This page makes no pretensions as to what it is.
It is quite simply an enormous waste of time that
provides amusing distractions and some helpful self

Professor seeks students to learn about
autism, help build future for his son

BY ERicA PROSSER
PHI STAFF WRITER

11 over campus, a photograph ofa smiling child
Ahangs from bulletin boards. The child is Caleb

Russell Lambert, the five-year-old son of Dr. Ken-
neth Lambert of the computer science department and Dr.
Demaree Peck, formerly of the English department.
Caleb’s photo accompanies ajob advertisement for“reliable,
enthusiastic” students willing to earn money or possibly course
credit. The position is one that would help Caleb have a “brighter
future,” for Caleb has autism.

“He was almost two years old before we noticed the
symptoms,” Dr. Lambert. Lambert said that Caleb walked
on tip-toe and spun Tupperware lids, flapping his arms.
Caleb’s parents had no idea that the toddler was autistic.

“He was in a playgroup,” Lambert explained, a group ofboys
his own age. Gradually, the other boys left Caleb behind. He
didn’t talk, and he played “inappropriately,” spinning objects
and withdrawing. But even the family physician did not notice a
problem in Caleb’s behavior, and it was Caleb’s grandmother
who impressed upon Lambert and Peck the need for testing.
They took their son to the Kluge
Center in Charlottesville, where
he was diagnosed with perva-
sive developmental delay
(PDD) with characteristics and
features of autism.

He was behind his peers

in expressive and receptive language and fine motor skills.
Upon diagnosis in October 1993, his language level was that
ofa nine-moiith-old infant. His fine motor skill level was at
about 12 months, but his gross motor skills were normal for
his age: he couldjump, run, and climb like any two—year-old.

“It was depressing news,” Lambert said ofthe diagnosis.
The doctor on hand gave Caleb’s parents no hope and of-
fered no helpful programs. There are few programs in this
area, Lambert said, since the population is small, and what
programs existed at the time did not serve the needs ofthe
autistic. So Dr. Peck took Caleb and their second child,
Catherine, to Rochester, NY, for treatment. Lambert stayed
in Lexington to teach and search for possible programs in
the area, perhaps in cities with larger populations.

Charlottesville and Roanoke were the only possibilities.
Finally, in the spring of 1994, Lambert found a program in
Roanoke, sold his Lexington house and moved to Roanoke
where Peck and the children joined him. He has commuted
from Roanoke to Lexington during the school year ever since,
but that is about to change. Expressing homesickness for this
area, Lambert said that he and his family will be moving back
to Lexington on May 29.

“The school in Roanoke isn’t enough,” Lambert mentioned.
“(Caleb) needs attention around the clock.” Lambert amended
that Caleb does sleep at night, but while he is awake and at home,
he needs constant one-on-one care to initiate appropriate behavior.
He plays well with supervision, but without it, he can regress. The
weekends are especially important. Since his diagnosis, Caleb has
come a long way in ﬁne motor skills, but he still does not talk, and
his receptive language skills are gaining very slowly.

Like most autistics, Caleb has excellent spatial think-
ing ability. He can recognize hundreds of written words
through making associations with pictures, and even at

the age of two, he could ﬁnd his way through a park even
after one visit. However, Caleb cannot use words in a
ﬁinctional context, and he may never grasp figurative
meanings, a problem that distresses his literary mother.
n many ways, Caleb is an ordinary ﬁve-year-old: he is ex-
tremely loving and affectionate, and he expresses himself

through sounds. To encourage his progress, Caleb’s par-
ents have advertised for students to give him the attention
he needs when they return to Lexington. In Roanoke, such
student help was a common occurrence.

Lambert recollected a Virginia Tech student who com-
muted from Blacksburg to Roanoke twice each week for
two years to work with Caleb. Students from Hollins and
Roanoke College worked, as well, some for psychology
credit arranged with the schools.

\ Because Lambert is usually commuting and Peck can-
not do everything herself, the student workers must be spe-
cial people. A good personality is a must, and a willing-
ness to be tactile and enthusiastic is necessary. Lambert
said, “It takes a certain kind of person,” and one can learn
to be that kind of person with practice. Workers are trained through
workshops and viewing Caleb’s records, including videotapes of
his behaviors and workbooks of his progress. Workers then learn
how to help Caleb through discrete trial therapy and drill therapy.
Lambert said that he and his wife were able to teach students how
to do this after they themselves learned.

The signs all over campus advertise for student workers that
can interact with Caleb once the family retums to Lexington.
Lambert and Peck are currently trying to work out an arrange-
ment with the psychology department that could offer course credit
to interested students. For now, a student helper can work 6-12
hours per week and make six dollars per hour working with Caleb.
Lambert mentioned that some students in the past have made
“pretty good money” this way. This position is also an opportu-
nity to learn about autism firsthand. Interested students need not

be psychology majors, and they need not give “therapy” in this
job. Caleb primarily needs structured play, and the student would
function as a unique babysitter. Interested students should contact
Demaree Peck at (540) 776-3325 until May 29. After that, infor-
mation should be sought at 21 1 Barclay Lane, Lexington.

OH-LA -LA! Q11 EST-CE (J EST?
FRENCH CLASS PRESENTS
THEATER or-‘ TJHJE AJBSURJD

BY CATHERINE RUTH FELTON
PHI STAFF WRITER

Looking for an opportunity to see some fellow students
acting for the first time... in French? Here’s your chance.

Professor Domnica Radulescu’s French Theater
class will be performing “Le Roi se meurt” by Eugene
lonesco and “En attendant Godot” by Samuel Beckett
this week in Lenfest’s Johnson Theater.

Both plays were written during the French avant—
garde period, also called the theater of the absurd. “The
plays are similar in that they both pose the philosophi-
cal question of waiting for the end,” said Radulescu,
the creator and director.

The class has been preparing for the production all
Spring Term. They began by studying the period and
the playwrights, then they learned about the elements
of production. Now they are frantically trying to re-
member their foreign lines as they rehearse in cos-
tumes that they create themselves.

“We gathered all the props and designed our own
costumes,” said freshman Hillary Everist. ‘‘It’s been
really fun.”

   

The plays altemate scenes, and the students, most of whom
have never acted before, switch roles for each scene.

- “It’s wonderful because all the parts are so varied," said
sophomore Becca Harris. “It’s good for the creativejuices.“

The students will perform “Le Roi se meurt” and “En atten-

dant Godot” in the Johnson Theater May 28, 29 and 30 at 8 p.ni.

Double standards

Double standards abound.

Whether it is with the "walk of fame"
and "walk of shame" concept or the pun-
ishments levied upon students at the two
Lexington colleges, the double standard
is all around us.

The two VMI cadets caught April 30 steal-
ing the blue and white ﬂags W&L displays on
big weekends received a far too lenient pun-
ishment.

When a W&L student was caught a
couple of years ago in the VMI barracks,
she was arrested and charged by the Lex-
ington Police Department with
tresspassing. We feel that vandalism and
theft are a far more serious crimes than
tresspassing, and the VMI cadets should
have been arrested and thrown in jail.

“If we catch them again, we'll put them in
jail,” said Director of Security Mike Young.
They should have been put injail the first time.
Since these three were seniors, there will not
be a next time.

The other possible punishment for the
three was the loss of their military com-
missions. The cadets were caught in an
act of theft and vandalism, and they should
not be U.S. military officers. A similar
act at Annapolis, the Air Force Academy
or West Point would have incurred far
more serious punishments.

So much for the discipline VMI loves to
promote. Whether the act was a prank or not,
it was still a crime which should have been
punished more severely than painting a couple
of curbs. F

W&L has no qualms about expelling se-
niors who commit honor violations; what is so
different about VMI? Who can forget the open
trial two years ago? That had a profound effect
on Jarrod Aldom's life.

We hope that Mr. Young will punish cadets
who commit crimes on this campus more se-
verely in the future.

Political miracle rescued
from liberal interference

Dick Gcphardt is at it again.

Two ofthe few remaining die-hard liber-
als in Congress. Rep. Gephardt. D—Mo.. and
Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass, almost suc-
ceeded in killing a Washington miracle: a

bipartisan balanced budget agreement. At 3
a.m. Wednesday, it passed the House 333-
99, and it passed the Senate fairly easily on
Friday. The bill now goes to committee to iron
out the differences between the two plans.

As is always the case with Washington
politics, two parties are trying to achieve the
same end but want to use radically different
means. In a case of divine intervention,
President Clinton and Congress agreed on a
plan;when Gephardttriedtoblockit, Clinton
supported the bipartisan plan and killed
Gephardt’s plan.

Gephardt worried that the plan hurt
people. Hewentontosay that deficitswould
spiral after the ﬁve years which the agree-
ment covers because the agreement only
balanced the budgeton paper. He had no real
facts, but called it the “budget of many
deficits,” including “a deficit of principle.”
He probably voted against the agreement to
boost his national reputation so he can chal-
lenge Al Gore for the presidency in 2000.

Kennedy proposed a $20 billion cigarette

tax to help provide health coverage to poor
children. He knew that such an amendment
would kill the balanced budget plan. The
plan would raisethecigarettetax by 43 cents
a pack and the funding would go to a new
program. Although this program is billed as
"vo1untary” by its promoters, it is a man-
datory program in which states must par-
ticipate in order to receive money. The
program also includes several other man-
dates which would have cost states even
more money.

There is an insurance coverage gap. Pri-
vate companies cover 63 percent of the
nation’s 71 million children. 23 percent are
covered by Medicaid, 1 percent are listed as
“other” and 14 percent are uninsured. The
current budget plan already has $16 billion
set aside to close the insurance coverage gap
for children. There is nothing wrong with a
tobacco tax. but this problem doesn’t need to
be solved by levying more taxes.

Instead of levying more taxes to cover
health care, the Republicans have some
ideas on how to help defray the costs of
healthcare for children. The ﬁrst is allowing
children’s health care to be tax-deductible.
A second is idea is allowing parents to set up
tax-free medical savings accounts.

A few years ago, the Democrats had no

trouble “hurting” military families and 1

defense contractors’ families by closing
military bases all over the country and
slashing the size ofthe military. Nobody
wants children to suffer. Even the far-
thest-right conservatives don’t want that,

Helping you to remember what you learned

rest of my life and this is my very last column. It puts me in a
reﬂective mood about how my life will change. Soon I’ll be

reading, but I also will no longer be able to get away with
wearing a hat instead of showering. lwon’t be able to wake
upon a Monday morning and decide to stay in bed. I will be,
in short, an adult. Yikes.

My reﬂections are not just on my future, but on my past four
years. I think the other seniorsyvjould agree that we’ve learned
a lot at Washington and Lee. Sure, we’ve learned a lot about our
respective majors, but I that doubt my knowledge of Pablo
Neruda’s poetry will get me far in the corporate world. We’ve
also learned some practical stuff, but unfortunately no one seems

able to remember what it is. You have me to remind you, in case
your parents ask.

Here’s what I have learned in college:

The exact amount of time it takes to write a ﬁve page
paperon any subject. I have written so many of those since
I’ve been here that I could write a ﬁve page paper in Spanish
about my belly button.

The extreme value of quarters. After ﬁnding quarters to be
as vital as oxygen for four years, not needing to feed the machine
when I wash my clothes from now on will be a hard task to learn.

How to mix drinks. I don’t mean just knowing what
goes into a martini; I could have learned that at a state school.
I mean that if you name any non-alcoholic beverage, I can
tell you what would mix well with it. Milk? Kahlua. Grape
Nehi? Vodka. Kaopectate? Captain Morgan’s Spiced Rum.
Feel free to challenge me.

down thus: North good, South bad. Now I know there’s a
little more to it than that.
Beer before liquor, never sicker. liquor before beer,

never fear. This handy phrase was like a mantra during the ﬁrst
part of my freshman year. It seemed so prosaic that I considered
embroidering it on a pillow.

The value of friends (and how to spot ‘em). Isolated
here in little Lexington, our friends become our families.
They’re people to hold on to. On another note, l’ve learned
that if you ever find yourselfthinking, “He’s my friend, but
we really don’t have much to talk about,” or “She’s my
friend; Ijust can’t trust her,” then that person is not your
friend. That’s not as obvious as it seems.

How to embrace your inner Southerner. Even though
I grew up in the midwest, I now eat grits, drink mintjuleps,
enjoy seersucker jackets and can hear the word “y’all”
without laughing.

Honor isn’t so hard. Leading an honorable life isn’t so hard
to do. Sure, it might take some extra effort to study foratest rather
than cheat on it,’ may be rxasier to lie sometimes, but I’ve
found that knowing deep down inside that I am an honorable
person makes it all worthwhile.

Like I said before, I guess this is it. I suppose l’1l see you all
at those alumni cocktail parties. I’ll be the one mixing the drinks.

The biggest blunder which most novices
make is selling their soul to Satan—BIG mis-
take. He didn’t become the Prince of Darkness
by dealing fairly with others. The Devil is
simply the ﬁrst guy to make an offer. He gets his
customers because his major competitor in the
soul business, Jesus, has never been known to
offer people worldly possessions for their eter-
nal spirits. This lackluster competition has

given Marilyn Manson, I mean, Satan, avirtual
monopoly on the Christian soul market, the
largest in the world.

Shop around. There are plenty of other
deities who would love to have your soul.
Consider Osiris, the Egyptian god of the dead.
This guy is desperate for a few new souls in his
underworld. While Satan will spend only a few
million bucksfortopofthelinesouls,Osiriswi1l

all these wretched people could get pyramids
full of gold.

Ahura Mazda, “Wise Lord” of the Zoroas-
trians, is another good god for the savvy soul-
seller. “You’d think that for one of the oldest
religions in the world we would have more than
a couple of Persians to show for it,” Ahura
Mazda thus spake. “It’s not helping things that

THE LOST WORLD’:
BETTER THAN ‘JURASSIC PARK’

at * * of 4; thoroughly entertaining

The pitch: “It'll be like ‘Jurassic Park’ with more dinosaurs and less

annoying jerky people.”
iw ALEX CllRlS'l‘I~1NSl€N
PHI IVIOVIIE CRITIC

“Jurassic Park” was not what I’d call a
“good movie.” In fact, it’s not really what I’d
call a “passable movie.” It just downright
sucked. If it hadn’t had so many cool dino-
saurs, I would have walked out. The charac-
ters were annoying whiners and I wanted them
dead. They took way too much screen time
away from the dinos. In fact, nearly every time
there would be a good dinosaur shot, they
would immediately cut away to the moronic
gaping face of some Hollywood actor. Spare
me. Plus, all the characters who lived to the
end were either insane or really stupid. What
kind of identification can you make with
such losers?

“The Lost World: Jurassic Park” seems to
have realized the mistakes made in the first ﬁlm.
Better than that, the dino-producing technol-
ogy has blossomed thanks to great leaps for-
ward in CG tech-
nology. Now we
can have all dino-
saurs all the time.
That’s all I ever
asked for.

I’m not going to
try to sell you a bill
of goods and say that
this movie isn’t cheesy. The
plot is thin and contrived, though not
distractingly so. The one-liners are enter-
taining, surpassing most other action mov-
ies one-liners by leaps and bounds. In fact,
you may never listen to a one-liner the same way
again. But they are one-liners, the typical
action-inovie substitute for dialogue. Oh well.

Even the plot setup is cheesy. Ian Malcolm
(Jeff Goldblum) is summoned to a meeting with
John Hammond (Richard Attenborougli), the cre-
ator of the Jurassic Park of the first movie. He wants
to recruit Malcolm to go to “Site B,” the breeding
center for Jurassic Park, which is on another island
next door to the one in the ﬁrst movie.

A distressing interjection here: these is-
lands are part of a FIVE-ISLAND CHAIN
which is referred to as “Las Cinco Muertas:
The Five Deaths”! I don’t mention this to
frighten you with a premonition of death, but of
more sequels! I can see it now. “Dinoﬁnger:
The Lost World 2: Jurassic Park 3”: “Oh, sorry,

Ian, didn‘t I tell you about Site C‘? That’s where
we keep the pterodactyls that know sign lan-
guage.” “Thunder Lizard: The Lost World 3:
Jurassic Park 4”: “Oh, didn’t I mention Site D?
That’s where we keep the mean ones!” And so
on... Really, this one is ﬁne, but I can only fore-
see a degeneration ifthe sequels keep coming. I
appeal to the gods who punish greed to send a
telegram to Spielberg c/o Universal.)

So anyway, Malcolm, understandably,
doesn’t want to go. He was ridiculed as a nut for
trying to expose Jurassic Park for what it was,
and, of course, he was chased by dinosaurs and
nearly killed. You can see why he wouldn’t want
to repeat that experience. But Hammond, evil
genius that he is, has thought ahead. He already
recruited Malcolm’s girlfriend, shapely science
girl Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore). Now
Malcolm has his motivation: to rescue her.

The best thing about the movie is Jeff
Goldblum. I absolutely hated him in “Jurassic
Park.” He was this condescending, lazy whiner
who didn’t seem to care if he was eaten. He sat
around in his leatherjacket and sunglasses and
said ironic things while dinosaurs hunted him. I

' couldn’t take his blasé attitude. Hejust didn’t

seem to care.

But in this ﬁlm, the audience isn’t asked to
take it seriously, so his one-liners are funny.
His attitude has also been altered because of
the presence ofhis girlfriend and his daughter
Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester). You feel his
strain when they are in danger, and you like
him a lot better.

Vanessa Lee Chester’s character also does
an amazing feat straight out ofthat old Mr. T
cartoon where they beat up villains with their
amazing gymno-skills. I loved that show, and
I appreciate the nod to all ofus fans who have
missed it for so long. Also notable in the cast
are Pete Postlethwaite as The Great White
Hunter (not silly) and Arliss Howard as John
Hammond’s egomaniacal nephew (wonder-
fully silly).

Of course, the situations are ridiculous, the
tension sometimes collapses into laughs, the sci-
ence is bad, etc., etc. But the overriding
counterargument to all of these criticisms is that
we get excitement, lots of beautiful dinosaurs,
and even those pterodactyls which were myste-
riously missing from the first ﬁlm. Thank you,
Mr. Spielberg, and now it’s on to “Amistad” and
“Saving Private Ryan” and “Indy 4” and let’s
win there.

New inn offers superb experience

Wow! What a terriﬁc experience for our last
review this year. On Tuesday night we checked
out the new Sheridan Livery Inn.

Upon entering we discovered a spectacular
atmosphere. The distant wall consisted entirely
oflarge picture windows, and a festive fountain
gurgled its playful song in the center of the res-
taurant. In the background, the music of piano
genius George Winston was playing, and the many
patrons all seemed to be enjoying themselves; it
was like a scene out of Hotel California.

The varied menu offered us an excellent se-
lection. The main focus seems to be ‘surf and
turf but the restaurant also offers everything
from Burgers to Scallops in Bourbon and from
Grilled Lamb Chops to Ruben sandwiches. The
wide variety made our decisions diﬁicult.

Soon we were ready to order: Spinach and
Pesto Chicken on a bed of linguini for Robin
and the 802 New York Strip for Doug. Both
entrees came with a choice of soup or salad.
Robin choose the vegetarian vegetable soup
while Doug selected a salad with Tomato Bal-

samic Vinaigrette dressing. Both ofthese first
courses were excellent! Robin’s soup was full
offresh spices and seasonings, while the dress-
ing on Doug’s salad was unlike anything he has
ever had in Lexington before —— truly unique.
The first course also came with fresh
bread that stayed soft and ‘
palatable throughout the
meal. It was obviously oven-
prepared, not microwaved.

Our surprise did not end with the presenta-
tion. The taste of our dishes supported their
looks. Robin’s dish was rich and ﬂavorful;
Doug‘s steak was tender and prepared exactly
as he likes it. Our waitress even brought back
the “police baton“ pepper grinder, which Doug
had used for his salad, and offered its use with
the entrees.

We were beginning to feel full, but wejust
didn‘t want to let this good time end, so we
ordered desserts. We selected the White
Chocolate Mousse with raspberry sauce and
the Double Chocolate Cake. The desserts
were the perfect end to a perfect meal. As
we ﬁnished the restaurant was still crowded,
but we did not feel pressured
to leave. We probably could
have slept in our booth and
they wouldn’t have objected.

Good casting makes ‘Into the Woods’ a success

but the results of her wants do not lead to the happiness she seeks.
The playwright, James Lapine, added the characters of the Baker

written as dim-witted.

 

“Into The Woods” opened Friday nightto asold-out audience. Billed
as a “thoroughly beguiling mixture of fairy-tale characters” with “de-
lightful music” and “magical staging,” it ﬁilﬁlled its promises.

As the curtain rose, the set came into view. The professional look
to the all the scenery provided an excellent backdrop for the action
taking place in front of it. Probably the most impressive aspect proved
to be the woods themselves. As scenes changed, the woods them-
selves shifted on platforms. The moon and stars that appear later in the
show lend an eerie feeling to the set that is most appropriate.

“Once upon atime,” the narrator begins, “in far off kingdom lived a
fair young maiden, asad young lad and a childless baker with his wife.”
This line begins a frantic and imaginaryjoumey to fulﬁll wishes and
break curses. The familiar tales become intertwined and lead to fates
previously unimagined for the characters involved.

Little Red Riding Hood, played by freshman Brittany Ahlstrom,
was very convincing as the innocent, little girl that we all know and
love from one of our favorite fairy tales. In the woods, she packs a
knife and pulls it out on a number of occasions.

T.W. Leshner portrays Jack, a boy who is rather slow but loveable.
It was amazing to learn that this was his ﬁrst appearance in a musical.
He brought out a serious side to Jack even though the character is

In the ﬁrst act, Cinderella stays true to the original Grimm fairy tale
as compared to the toned down Disney version. Freshman Mackenzie
Caldwell, Cinderella, ﬁt the part visually and offered the audience a
look into Cinderella’s real personality. She wishes for many things,

We’ve been doing t

and his wife to tie all the other tales together. Denis Riva as the
Baker was convincing as a harried, common man dealing with witches
and giants. The men of audience can relate to him, even when he
performs the strangest actions. Tara Herbert ﬁlling the role of the
Baker’s wife appeals to the women in the audience. She is strong
minded and sensible, but still dreams of her prince.

Perhaps the best performance was that of the Witch, Adrienne
Bryant. The role itself is very demanding, yet Bryant proved herself
extremely capable. She was the witch we all hate and fear, but Bryant
shows us the depth of her emotions.

The princes played by Aaron Brotherton and lady Koch made a
pair obsessed with self-gratiﬁcation. They battle in song to prove
who is going through the most suﬁering while obtaining their women.
“Agony,” sung by the two prince,s reveals their self—obsession and
yearning for the opposite sex.

“No More,” a duet sung by the Baker and the Mysterious Man
played by Zach Hanks, was very emotional closure to a hectic story
line. The ballad was performed skillfully and rendered a heart-felt
response from the audience.

Minor catches included actors tripping, a missed light cue and a
few missed notes. This can only be expected on opening night and
improved upon with each following performance.

The show promises much and delivers more. From excellent

make-up for the Wolf to beautiful costumes and from superb light-
ing to marvelous performances by the cast and orchestra, the play
will not disappoint, rather it will delight and inspire.

BYOB: it’s the
law of the land

BY KATHRYN MAYURNIK
Te NEWS EDITOR
YOB is here, and if things
work the way the Interfrater-
nity Council hopes, it is here
to stay.

This does not mean that drinking
will end at fraternity parties, it just
means that instead of the fraternities
footing the bill, it’s the partier’s penny
—- or a willing brother’s.

The IFC decided at the end of last
year that fraternities are to adhere a
“Bring Your Own Booze” policy at
fraternity houses, meaning that frater-
nities can no longer use house funds
to purchase alcohol.

“Students who want to drink at
fraternity parties have two choices
now,” IFC President Jason Callen
said. “They could bring their own
alcohol or they could drink alcohol
purchased by brothers.”

According to Callen, BYOB has
actually always been policy in the IFC
Constitution, but it has never been en-
forced.

The IF C meets this week with fra-
ternities to discuss ways they can carry
out BYOB. Fraternities do not have
to have enforce BYOB the same way,
but will each come up with a system
that works best for them, Callen said.

on up

its classes under 20 students and 75%
of the freshmen were in the top 10%
of their high school class.

Freshman Jean Rowan said she
chose W&L because it was a good
school with an excellent business pro-
gram.

“I liked the small school and safe
atmosphere,” she said. She also
pointed out that other factors not in-
cluded in the ratings such as the Honor
System and the speaking tradition also
helped her to make her final college
decision.

“It was that it all came together,”
Rowan said.

Howison also noted that key
things go beyond the rankings tend to
inﬂuence potential students more af-
ter they have visited the campus. He

feels that such aspects of the school
make it stand out from the others in

a student’s potential decision.
Washington and Lee has
been steadily climbing the
rankings of U.S. News and
World Report in the last few
years, and this will potentially
bring an even higher caliber

of student to the campus.

Dennis Manning,
Dean of the Freshmen Pro-

QDSEERANKPAGEZ

Some fraternities might use a tag
bar, where students would place their
alcohol behind the bar. Others mays
use a ticket system. Brothers would
distribute tickets to students that they
could trade in for a share of a particu-
lar brother’s alcohol. Students could
also request alcohol at parties from
specific brothers.

“This might make a fraternity
brother think twice about giving a
beer to a drunk person,” Callen said.
“Fratemties were always liable, but
now the brothers will be personally
liable for the alcohol they distribute.”

This policy might be more of a
shock to Washington and Lee women,
who have traditionally received alco-
hol with no questions asked. “But on
the other hand, what fratemtiy guy
will refuse giving a woman a beer?”
Callen said.

The penalty for a fratemity's first
offense of the BYOB policy is a
$2,000 fine and two weeks of social
probation. A second time offense is
a $2,500 fine, social probation for the
rest of the term and a potential refer-
ral to the Student Affairs Committee.
The SAC could suspend a fraternity
charter, kick them off campus or im-
pose other stringent punishments.

“A third offense would mean

very serious problems for the frater-
nity,” Callen said. “Maybe I’m just
being optimistic, but I don’t think that
it will ever get as far as a third offense,
or‘ even a second.”

Other IFC changes include ban-
ning fratemties from having grain al-
cohol on the premises. This fell un-
der the existing regulation that pro-
hibits communal sources, such as kegs
and barrels of grain alcohol, but now
it will be enforced more strictly.

IFC will observe parties to ensure

that the policies are being enforced.
V “I think that it is a positive step
for IFC and the fraternities them-
selves,” Callen said. “This is some-
thing that we’ve done completely on
our own without orders from the Hill
like Winter Rush.”

Winter Rush was instituted last
year in place of the long standing Fall
Rush.

“I think that BYOB will reform
irresponsible and unsafe behavior that
often went on at W&L,” Callen said.

W&L President John Elrod is
supportive of the new policies.

“It was refreshing to read the new
policies. I do think it will be a chal-
lenge to enforce them,” Elrod said. “If
this is enforced, alcohol abuse at W&L
will disappear.”

Dead rats scurry
mysteriously from
freezer to VMI

BY KATHRYN MAYURNIK
—j—--— NEWS EDITOR

Virginia Military Institute Post Po-
lice Larry Coffey called it a hate crime.

Some called it a harmless prank.
But no one can deny the strange cir-
cumstances surrounding the discovery
of 24 dead rats accompanied by a “Save
the Males” sign found by children on
the grounds in front of Superintendent
Josiah Bunting’s house.

Authorities believe that the act was
committed by a Washington and Lee
student. Coffey believes now that it was
probably a prank, but at the time, it
looked like something much more se-
rious.

“It was almost like a civil rights
violation, like burning a cross,” Coffey
said. “One gender was singled out in
this prank, and that makes it a threat. It
is a situation that could have gotten se-
rious.”

The rats and the sign were discov-
ered on August 20,just two days after the
anival of the ﬁrst female cadets at VIVH.

Chief Coffey contacted W&L Se-
curity Chief Michael Young after the

incident. Young traced the rodents to

' a group of 100 that were to be inciner-

ated by two W&L students working for
Building and Grounds over the sum-
mer. _

The unnamed students claim that
they took 24 rats and placed them in a
freezer to play a prank on a friend.

“It was a get-even kind of thing,”
Young said.

The rats mysteriously made their
way out of the freezer and over to VMI.

lectronic renovation’

 

SEPTEMBER 9, 1997 9

of student computing

BY Curr Wooiuzv

 

Cow EDITOR

Returning students will ﬁnd dra-
matic changes in student computing
awaiting them this school year. Per-
haps the most outwardly apparent
changes have been in the public com-
puter labs around campus, but the
electronic renovations of the campus
computing environment can be felt
even in campus housing.

Incoming students will not have
had an opportunity to become famil-
iar with the older systems around the
University; however, even they will
feel the beneﬁts of the improved lab
and dormitory computing strategies.
This year’s incoming freshman class
represents the ﬁrst class to be auto-
matically assigned network accounts
on the new student computing server,
Jefferson, instead of the old UNIX
server, Liberty. Returning students
will retain their Liberty accounts in ad-
dition to accounts on the new system.

The Jefferson server is running
the latest version of Novell’s
lntranetware, a ﬁle server operating
system which is far easier to integrate
with today’s \}Vindows95 operating
system than past systems. This case
of integration allows for seamless ﬁle
transfers and printing over the net-
work, as well as the use of the Pegasus
e-mail program, which is more user-
friendly than its UNIX counterpart,
Pine.

The ﬁrst minor obstacle students
must overcome to familiarize them-
selves with the new environment is the
login procedure. New students’
usemames are their full last names
followed by their first initial. Retum-
ing students retain the same

usernames they have on Liberty,
which have nomially been their ﬁrst
initial followed by the ﬁrst seven let-
ters of their last name. There is a
catch, however, which requires further
explanation. Users of lntranetware do
not actually log into an individual
server; they log into a tree of network
resources called the Novell Directory
Services. This can give them access
to resources scattered among multiple
servers. The catch is that to access
the tree, the user must specify to the
login program which ‘branch’ of the
tree contains his or her user-object.
Students are divided into sub-
branches by class year; this means that

students must also specify their class _

C C
Improved network ﬁle
sharing is one of the major
enhancements provided
by the new system.

year to log into the network. This is
accomplished by adding a period and
the class year after the usemame, as
in smithj. 01 for an undergraduate
freshman or smithj. 001 for a ﬁrst-year
law student.

Improved network ﬁle sharing is
one of the major enhancements pro-
vided by the new system. Students
can save documents in one of several
places on the network for easy access
from their rooms and the labs. The
‘H:’ drive is mapped for each user to
that user’s individual home directory.
The home directory is personal space
in which only that individual has read

or write privileges. The ‘K:’ drive is
mapped to a shared workspace. Any-
one can read or write to this area, and
items placed there are subject to dele-
tion at any time. However, it is ideal
for short-temi storage or transfer of
ﬁles from one user to another. The
‘L:’ drive is reserved for course work.
Professors wishing to utilize the space
can contact University Computing,
and a separate area for their class will
be created under the ‘L:’ drive. Stu-
dents enrolled in the class will be
given access to the ﬁles and folders
under that course’s directory as the
Professor sees ﬁt.

The other major beneﬁt students
will see is in the network printing
arena. Returning students may won-
der why there are no longer card-
reader devices attached to all of the
laser printers in the labs, and why the
dot-matrix printers have disappeared.
The card-readers are gone because
accounting for the lasers is now
handled automatically by the server
once a user has logged in. Printing
charges are assessed at $.10 per page,
and are billed at the end of the term.
However, undergraduate students
have been given a $20 print subsidy,
so the ﬁrst 200 pages printed per temi
are ﬁee. Users wishing to check their
printing balance may do so by logging
into any lab machine and then click-
ing on the ‘$’ symbol in the bottom
right-hand comer of the screen. The
dot-matrix printers have been re-
moved because of their age and high-
maintenance nature. The print sub-
sidy is intended to make up for the
lack of a free printing facility that the
removal of these older printers has
caused.

University Computing has high
hopes that these changes to the stu-
dent computing environment will fa-
cilitate the ease of use of the
University’s ever-growing base of
computer resources and will allow
users to take better advantage of the
computing power available to them.
Questions about the procedures for the
use of computing resources on cam-
pus can be answered online at the
‘Computing at W&L’ section of the
University’s website, or by contact-
ing the University Computing
HelpDesk at 462-HELP (extension
4357 from on-campus).

po icy changes .

BY JASON ZACI-IER
—S—— EXECUTIVE EDITOR

There are several changes greet-
ing Washington and Lee Students as
they come back to school this fall.
While most of the changes are minor,
several will have an impact on students.

“Some of it is a desire to be pre-
cise in the language for students and
for legal reasons,” said University
Registrar Scott Dittman.

Some of the changes include

ﬂb Changes to five majors:
Chemistry, Classics, English, Music
and Neuroscience.

QD Interdepartmental 110 was
added to the general education options
for Social Science.

fit: The minimum grade-point
average for a major in Independent
Work has been raised to 2.75.

_ The SJC’s policies and procedures
are spelled out in the course catalog.
According to Dittman, perhaps
the biggest change to the catalog lies
within the Automatic Rule.
The Automatic Rule changes
were confirmed by the Committee on
Courses and Degrees and then by the

full faculty. The changes were made
in March and takeeffect this fall.

The Automatic Rule has been
expanded to include students who
have under a 1.0 GPA for two con-
secutive terms. Dittman cited a stu-
dent who had a 0.0 GPA aﬁer fall,
winter and spring terms. Under the old 7
catalog, the student could not be re-
moved from the university until June,
but with the changes, he could have
been removed aﬁer Winter Term.

Any student falling under the’
Automatic Rule is subject to review
by the Committee on the Automatic
Rule and Readmissions.

The other substanitive change is y
with overload classes. Previously, stu-
dents had six weeks to drop an over-
load class, but that has been.changed
to three weeks. The deadline for this

tem is October 1. Also, late pass/fail‘

declarations will require a fee.

Students are urged to visit the
Registrar’s web page at http://
www.wlu.edu/~registra for more in-..‘
formation about the changes, and con-
sult with your adviser about changes
to your major.

TOM RIEGEL

Journalism emeritus professor.

O.W.(Tom) Riegel, 94, a world au-
thority on propaganda, died August
22, 1997 at Stonewall Jackson Hos-
pital in Lexington, Va., following a
minor stroke the previous day.

His contributions to the study of
journalism at Washington and Lee are
legendary. He introduced the study
of ﬁlm to the school and started

W&L’s first radio station, WLUR-
FM, in 1967. He came to W&L in
1930 as an assistant professor, and
was named director of the department
ofjoumalism and mass communica-
tions in 1934, a position he held for
34 years.

“He was a master ofjoumalism,”
author Philippe Labro said. “He is the
stuff that W&L legends are made of.”

Riegel made a name for himself in
the ﬁeld of propaganda and public
opinion research with the 1934 publi-
cation of his award winning study,

Mobilizting for Chaos:The Story of
New Propaganda.” During World
War II he took a leave of absence from
W&L to become principal propa-
ganda analyst in the Office of War In-
formation.

He was survived by his wife, ﬁve
childrem 15 grandchildren and three
great-grandchildren.

BY ALEX CHRISTENSEN

FIIMCRITIC

Well, the results are in. The highly anticipated sum-
mer of ‘97 is over, the most recent action-adventure mas-
terpieces have unspooled to record box ofﬁce numbers—~
and can you really remember a favorite moment from any
of them? Here’s a short review of the disastrous summer
that was, with its high points and low points and some
notable points in between.

Catchphrase of the summer. You may have read the

\ tag and thought, “Get off my plane!” or “Woo-wee you

good—lookin’ l” or “If I let you suck on my tongue, would
you be grateful?” or even, God help us, that obscene thing
a whacked-out and whacked—on Demi Moore screams at
Viggo Mortensen in one of the summer’s worst crap-fests,
but no. You didn’t think I’d go for any of those, did you?
(Although I must admit I often turn to myself in the mir-
ror and scowl deeply while growling, “Get off my plane!”
Try it. “Get off my plane!” Oh, yeah.) No, the true
catchphrase of the summer comes from an unlikely source

ﬂfé the children’s basketball-playing-dog movie “Air Bud.”

~ When the coach of the team (Bill Cobbs) tries to put the
iv} dog in the ﬁnal moments of the state championship, one

i of the referees searches frantically through his rulebook,

looks up and delivers one of those lines of dialogue that
will never die, pure Hollywood magic, the reason we go to

. summer movies in the ﬁrst place: “Ain’t no rule says adog can’t

play basketball.” Isn’t that the truth? An honorable mention to
the re-release of “Dirty Dancing,” which still contains that im-
mortal line, “Nobody puts Baby in a comer.”

Best blockbuster. I don’t know how you deﬁne a
blockbuster exactly, but the deﬁnition I’m using here is a
movie the studios made and marketed, from beginning to
end, with the intention of making $100 million or more.
So “My Best Friend’s Wedding,” though it beat “Batman
and Robin” at the box ofﬁce, wouldn’t qualify, though
“Batman and Robin,” while it did only slightly

ing each other masterfully, with an almost ee-
rie glee. The idea itself was a killer. Just watch-
ing them, understanding the concept that each
was supposed to be behind the other’s face, was
alternately unsettling and hilarious, and ulti-
mately more satisfying than it had any right to
be.

Worst blockbuster. Nicolas Cage made his
first bow of the summer in “Con Air” as
Cameron Poe, a prison inmate being transferred by plane
with a bunch of crazy serial killers when the plane is hi-
jacked and holy heck breaks loose. For some reason he
does a silly Southem-fried accent, sadly all-too—typical of
Hollywood efforts. And if you’ve made an action movie
in which the coolest catchphrase is “Put down the bunny,”
you know you’ve failed. Not one believable character,
not one effect that didn’t look just like the teeny model it
really was, no fun at all. No stars from me.

Trends. Of course, this brings up one of the most
disturbing trends of the summer. It seems like every movie
star had two ﬁlms this year: Cage had “Face/Off” and “Con
Air,” Travolta “Face/Off’ and “She’s So Lovely,” Julia
Roberts “My Best Friend’s Wedding” and “Conspiracy

Theory,” Alicia Silverstone Batman and Robin” and “Ex-
cess Baggage,” and so on and so on. Even stars who don’t
traditionally carry a movie, like Tommy Lee Jones,
Laurence Fishbume, Patrick Stewart, Mira Sorvino, Gary
Oldman, Andy Garcia and Kelly Preston, all bowed twice
this summer.

Is there some kind of shortage of stars out there? It
seems like Quentin Tarantino is the only director out there
willing to stake his movie on actors because of their ac-
tual acting ability without needing “star insurance.” It’s
good that he is, because Travolta wouldn’t be in the $20
million club if he weren’t. Tarantino understands how
good work creates stars, and not the other way around,
unlike this summer’s movie producers. Think about it. If
“Conspiracy Theory” didn’t have Mel Gibson and Julia
Roberts, it wouldn’t have been rewritten into stupidity
with its unnecessary subplots and goofy breakneck struc-
ture made up of 240 thirty-second scenes. Arnold
Schwarzenegger might not have had to be cast in “Batman
and Robin.” Not that “Batman and Robin” would have
been any better, you understand, but it certainly couldn’t
have been any worse.

The art-house. While the art—house (or independent
and foreign) ﬁlms generally seem to be an oasis from the
desert of Hollywood uncreativity, this summer only of-
fered a few really good ﬁlms. “In the Company of Men”
is the best movie l’ve seen all year, a ruthless and disturb-
ing ﬁlm about two business executives who decide to play
on the affections of a deaf ofﬁce secretary to get back at
the women in their lives. (It also produced a best
catchphrase contender, a weird twist on “Jerry Maguire”:
“Show me your balls.”) Other notable ﬁlms were the Japa-
nese dance comedy “Shall We Dance?”, the British male
strip-off ﬁlm “The Full Monty,” and Nick Cassavetes’s
romantic fable “She’s So Lovely,” with a stunner of a per-

formance from Sean Penn. The biggest art-house hit of .

the summer, however, “Ulee’s Gold,” proved to be an
exercise in boredom and cliche. God knows why the crit-
ics loved it. Peter Fonda wascompetent, but the ﬁlm was

so tedious I’m surprised so many people seem to have",

stayed awake for it.
Fall ﬂicks, winter picks...

In closing, let’s look forward rather than back. Here
are ﬁve sure bets for the fall and winter, in order of sure-
ﬁreness. You heard it here ﬁrst:

“Jackie Brown” marks Quentin Tarantino’s return to

directing. It’s an adaptation of Elmore
Leonard’s ﬁne novel “Rum Punch,” starring

better than “Tnrbni A P°WeT Rangers AdVen' Tun] [0 blaxploitation superstar Pam Grier, Robert

trailer offers a potential fall catchphrase: “Is ev-

Billy Bob Thornton, Nick Nolte, and Joaquin

“In & Out,” from writer Paul Rudnick
(“Addams Family Values,” “Jeffrey”), features
Kevin Kline as a teacher who is outed by a former student

Coach Jacobs announced, “For those of you who know

delight, Mr. Moore responded “Yes” to the big question. “We

‘Q9 It’s “bonding,” not hazing...
Over mountains, through forests,
across rivers, the 2,159-mile
Appalachian Trail traverses 14 states
from Maine to Georgia. Last week,
Outing Club members led 35 new
students on a small stretch of the
world famous path.

BY STEPHH\I Pi«3ci~:

STAFF Wanna

Over 30 freshmen and eight upperclassman hike lead-
ers set out on a freshman orientation favorite Sept. 6: the
overnight hike along the Appalachian Trail.

Early this summer, the Washington and Lee Out-

ter about the hike. Since only 35 students couldbe
accommodated, participants were selected by a lot-
tery system from the 133 who expressed interest be-
fore the application deadline.

When these frightened 35 arrived
to meet the hike leaders Tuesday af-
ternoon, none could expect the won-
derful experience that would follow.

The hikers were separated into groups of about
10 people. They knew few, if any, of the other
group members, yet all would soon acquaint them-
selves with the hopes, fears and just plain wacked-
up idiosyncrasies of the others. Some would use
words such as “wicked.” Some would not say
“y’all.” And still others had never heard of a grit.
(First of all, never speak of “a grit.” They are a
team, a package deal and prepared on a stove,
not in a microwave. As is made unmistakably
clear by one of the witnesses in “My Cousin
Vinnie” (a movie destined to be a classic), “No
self-respecting Southerner ever eats instant grits”)

Though each member of the group displayed individual
strengths and weaknesses, all united under the common
bond of a unique adventure. The hike provided the oppor-
tunity to spend time away from the traditional college par-
ties and university-arranged activities to truly get to know
other freshmen in real life.

One freshman claims that the trip was “the best intro-
duction to W&L possible. I now have over eleven friends
whom I know I’ ll stay in touch with, which has also boosted
my mind-set for meeting new freshmen as a whole. It was
wicked cool!”

The four groups hiked miles upon miles of tough ter-
rain together; learned that they all need some cooking les-
sons; and, most importantly, learned that each must lend a
helping hand to others for the sake of the whole.

The true heroes of the trip were the group leaders. Not

takes things as they come,” said Goodwin. “She
doesn’t sweatthe little things. She’s a great coach, and always has
time for everyone; she’s not just concerned with coaching.”

The wedding was held at the
Trinity United Methodist Church on
Main St., and followed by a recep-
tion in the Dining Hall. The center-
piece of the D-Hall’s decorating
scheme was the famous banner.

The wedding wasn’t Kiki
Moore’s only cause for celebration
this summer. She was recently
promoted to Aquatic Director,
making Moore the ﬁrst woman to
hold that position at W&L. With
a new men’s swimming coach and

 

   
  
   
  
 
 
 
  

 

a new assistant this year, Moore
looks forward to a “good year and
lots of changes.”

 

Upperclassmen help
a freshmen take a hike

only were the eight upperclassmen knowledgeable about
hiking necessities, but they were also down-to-earth and
understanding. These students, like all other Washing-
ton and Lee students, bent over backwards to make the
freshmen feel comfortable. The leaders became friends
with, as well as advisers to, the freshmen as they got an
early taste of the W&L experience of fun, teamwork
and respect in the relationships with group leaders.
Group leader Brian White remembers a night spent
watching the sunset and the stars atop the Priest and
says that the leaders enjoyed the trip just as much as the
freshmen did.

White believes that the trip accomplished its
goal of getting the freshmen to have fun and feel
comfortable with the new setting. He adds that al-
though this was most freshmen’s first long hike
‘ and the physicalstrains were demanding, the hik-
ers feel proud of their accomplishment.

The true tragedyiof the freshmen hike is that all
were not able to participate. Next year the outing club
 hopes to increase the number of partici-

V pants to 55. This will require upperclass-
man support.

_ Fortunately, opportunities to par-
ticipate this year in outing club activities
abound. Those freshmen who were not able to go
on the hike are invited to the freshmen day hikes
on Sept. 14.

Outing Club Coordinator Nick Tatar says that
the club hopes to hold ﬁve activities per week.

Club membership is only $20 for the entire year
and allows participation in all club hikes and classes

and the use of Outing Club gear. The university
also offers backpacking classes for physical edu-
cation credit. Further information about the
Outing Club and its activities may be obtained
from Nick Tatar, club members, the club’s
newsletter, The House Mm. Shadow, or the main
bulletin board in front of the co-op.

Many thanks to Nick and the upperclassmen who
generously gave their time, effort and support to the
freshmen who participated in the hike.

ADVICE

the women that as soon as winter
rush starts, all the great male friends
you have will burrow their way into
the house of theirchoice and will not
show their heads until pledgeship is
over. “ "

Big Brother is watching you. The
Greek system can resemble George
Orwell’s “1984.” Remember, the up-
perclassmen are already memorizing
the Freshman Facebook. Soon, they‘ ll
know who your are, so watch your
step.

To those of you who are not plan-
ning to join a sorority or fraternity,
RUSH anyway. I didn’t and really
regret it. You’ll meet tons of new
people, and who knows, you might
discover Greek life is just your style.
There is a lot of diversity among the
five sororities and fifteen fraternities
on campus.

Lex Vegas

Don’t let the size of the town fool
you. This little city has a lot to offer.
Hopkin’s Green makes a great resting
place on the weary walk from
Davidson Park to the Dorms. Wayne
at Night Owl can get any record or CD
overnight and for a dollar less than
anyone else in town. On weekends,
Domino’s delivers until 2 a.m. and
Lee Hi is open all night. You haven’t

lived until you've watched television
with the truckers (and showers are
only $5.)

A word about Wal—Mart: watch

yourspending. I swear my entire credit
card balance is the result of impulse
purchases at the superstore. I know
it’s tempting to charge that booney
Toons toilet seat, but trust me -- and
your parents -- just say no!

Finally, do everything that is hu-
manly possible. You are in a very
unique situation.

I know communal living can be a
disaster, but it is the only time you’ll
have 25 best friends who are always
willing to go to a Wednesday night

Proposing changes

Three months have changed Lexington very
little. With the exception of several new addi-
tions at Virginia Military Institute, our corner
of Virginia has withstood the forces of change
with admirable grace and predictable banality.
Which is not to say that things have to remain
the same. Keeping with our university’s motto,
we’d like to look ahead to a year of improve-
ments at Washington and Lee.

First, we should make an effort to drink
more responsibly. W&L has established itself
as a wet campus with a strong Greek presence.
Neither of these characteristics need change.
However, we should consider which we value
more highly: our own health and the safety of
others or our ranking in national drinking polls.
It’s all right to drink, but we should be careful
when we do. Excessive drinking is dangerous,
drunks are burdens to others and hangovers
aren’t fun.

Second, W&L would do well to encourage
more debate and thoughtful discourse between
its students. Last year’s meeting of Trident
columnist Glen Miller and G&L chairperson
Alex Christensen was a good start. If through
our discussions we decide that W&L needs to
change, then we have opened new opportunities
for ourselves. If we should decide that we don’t
need or don’t want to change, then at the very
least we have further defined who we are as a
university. Nothing bad can come from more
meetings in Northen Auditorium.

Third, U.S. News and World Report re-
cently ranked Washington and Lee as one of the
eighth best liberal arts colleges in the country.
Eighth? How did we. allow all those other
schools to become better than us? Why should
we settle for less than the best? Why not ﬂex a little
academic muscle? I would like nothing better than
for W&L to move up the charts the next time around.
When we do, we’ll be able to tell certain magazine
columnists just where to stick their rankings.

Last, we would rather not attend another rap
concert for Fancy Dress this year. Coolio was fun;
A T be Called Quest was okay; one more rap con-
cert woulg robabl kill u§6all_w§gre we stood. For
the most part,. th fudent Activities Board does an
excellent job’of riiatching the bands they hire to our
diverse tastes. However, if Puff Daddy shows up at
the Pavilion this March, we would have to wonder if
the SABI were purposefully trying to antagonize us.

We wishieveryone the best this year at Wash-
ington and Lee University. Despite what others
may have to say, we still believe that it is the
best school around.

Great women
remembered in
differing ways

The deaths of two of the
most respected women in the
world came as a shock to ev-
eryone last week, but the true

the Right
Zacher ’98

Phi Executive Et.iit<)r—

tragedy of the situation may
be in the way the two are be-
ing remembered.

No one can doubt the im-
pact and reach of Diana, Prin-
cess of Wales. Her untimely
death will be mourned by mil-
lions around the world. She
was a woman who could look
at a cause and make the world
suddenly care. When she
spoke about an issue, we lis-
tened intently, and wherever
she went, the crowds and
paparazzi followed. She made
sure that her son, Prince Wil-
liam, would grow into the
throne of the United King-
dom with a knowledge of the
world’s poor. But Diana also
was the Princess of fashion
and style — a 90’s equivalent
of Jackie Kennedy.

After watching hours
upon hours of continuous cov-
erage on Diana’s death on
CNN, MSNBC and other net-
works, announcers broke in
quickly to tell the world
Mother Teresa had passed

away from a heart attack.
Then it was back to Diana and
the tragedy of her death.

Examine the
women’s work.

Mother Teresa was born
in 1910 in Macedonia and
became a nun at age 18. Years
later, she entered the slums of
Calcutta, where she was not
accepted. She adopted the
local dress and customs, and
over time became an institu-
tion in the city. In an age
when it is becoming unfash-
ionable to give handouts to
people, she did not care. She
said she was doing the Lord’s work.

The Calcutta slums are
where Mother Teresa made
her fame with the Missionar-
ies of Charity, and after re-
ceiving the Nobel Peace Prize
in 1979, she told the audience
to disband the banquet and to
give the proceeds to the poor.

Mother Teresa owned vir-
tually nothing —just two sa-
ris and a prayer book. She
was nothing like the Princess,
who showed the world she
cared at a shelter and then
went back to Kensington Pal-
ace or the Ritz Hotel at night.
There is no doubt that Diana
cared about the less fortunate,
but she did not have to live
their life.

While Mother Teresa’s
fame was made in the slums,

she said. “I see so much of it.”
I suppose people are re-
membered the way they lived.

Mother Teresa lived a
godly life of service and pov-
erty. Princess Diana lived the
public life, always in the me-
dia spotlight. lonly hope that
Mother Teresa’s state funeral
on Saturday will be covered
in the same way Diana’s was,
so the world may mourn the
passing of a soul who’s pres-
ence on Earth made the world
a better place to li.ve.

No matter what their dif-
ferences were, both Diana and
Mother Teresa will be missed

by the world. May both of._

these great women rest in
peace.

Fabricating the whole ‘truth’ about W&L

man lost after delivering tons of col-

member how idyllic they made life
sound at the various institutions? Re-
member the misleading doublespeak
intended to make every cut rate com-
munity college sound like Harvard?
Unfortunately, Washington and
Lee’s brochures aren’t a model for
truth in advertising either. While the
Honor System prevents the adminis-
tration from outright lying, its mem-
bers find clever ways to hide the whole
truth. The people this hurts the most
are the freshmen. They expect one
thing, and then get here and find out
that, as the French say, n’est pas un

gros renard. Got it? No? Oh, dear.
Look,just hurry up and finish reading

cal regiment” —— organized torture.

I “courses designed to develop
critical thinking skills” -— which you
will ignore when your officers order
you around.

I “students gain a new sense of
self-respect” — students get lame-ass
haircuts.

What’s that you say? You want
some Swarthmore bashing? Well, I
don’t see why, but OK.

I “diverse student body”——— I think
we might even have a couple hetero-
sexuals!

I “get a complete education” —-
learn about hubris, ego, arrogance,
pretentiousness, etc.

I “learn to appreciate those with
different beliefs” — except, of course,
for rotten stinking conservatives.

Be sure to tune in next week for

part two: Carnegie Mellon bashing,’

University of South Dakota bashing
and lots and lots of Vassar bashing!

Exploration yields heavenly idleness

The other day I met the
man who was in charge of
turning the stars on and off.
He’s retired now and lives in
a spherical dwelling high up

My View
Tom Monaco ’01

in the Appalachian Moun-
tains. Every once in a while,
the man will tempt momen-
tum with some movement in-
side his dwelling and it will
roll down the side of the
mountain. The man is usually

angry when this happens, but
he always gets out and rolls
the dwelling back up to the
mountaintop.

The only thing that really
upsets the man is the fact that
he was forced to retire from
his job because of the actions
of the human race. You see,
in the days before space travel
this man had a schedule which
told him what stars he should
turn on and when he should
do it. This schedule was set
up according to the various
times of sunset in each region
of the earth. As long as there

was the schedule, the man was
happy because he had a pur-
pose; however, then the hu-
man race decided to screw
things up by exploring the
universe outside of the earth.

The day that the human
race first reached space, the
man had his dwelling set up
just a few miles away from
the sun. The sun happened to
be a very good friend of the
man, and they happened to be
in the middle of a discussion
on interstellar relations when
they were interrupted by the
emergency indicator flashing

inside the man’s dwelling.
Seeing that the human
race had acquired the ability
to extend beyond the bounds
of Earth’s atmosphere, the
man was forced to turn on
every star in the galaxy in-
definitely. The problem that
arose was two-fold: first,
since every star had to be kept
on, their life span decreased
immensely, and second, the
only thingthat this man could
ever do was now obsolete. So,
because of the audacity ofthe
human race, both the friends
and the livelihood of this man

were put at risk.

' Fortunately (or maybe un-
fortunately for humans) this
man does not take things ly-
ing down. He says he has
retired to the mountains of
the earth, but I know better.
Just like he is never discour-
aged when his dwelling rolls
down the mountain, I am posi-
tive that this little setbackwon’t

get him down. In fact, I believe.

he is inside of that sphere right
now plotting the destruction of
the space program. Maybe he’|l
succeed, maybe not, but he is not
going to give up.

This is to the class of 2001. I was in your shoes three
years ago, free of my parents, their rules, their curfews, free
to do whatever I wanted. It felt great and still does. There
are, however, so many things I wished I’d known. Ask
anyone who knew me three years ago. I was naive. Maybe
some of you have already been advised by your team
mates, or upperclassmen friends. But there are lots of you
——a lot— like me a little clueless, a little lost and a little
scared.

You’re doing great. Most of you found Aqua Velva
Saturday night. Although y’all didn’t get tear gassed like
the class of 1998, it was a pretty crazy night. Here’s a little
free unsolicited advice picked up from countless conversa-
tions l’ve had and people I’ve asked, “What do you wish
you knew your freshman year?”

The Hill
Grade inﬂa-
tion is a myth. If
you were hoping
to get a four point
. the first semester,
forget about it.
Few professors
understand the
late nights and
hoopla of your
freshman year,
but most expect
pupils to be
awake and ca-
pable of speech.
Second,
registration does
not get any
easier as you get

FREsH1vr A N

older. The lines will always be long and no matter how
early you get up, someone will be there before you.

If you want to get an understanding professor, consult
upperclassmen for the real low-down on a professor. Your
advisor, caring as he or she may be, will not divulge this
crucial information.

The Dorms

This will be the place where the best memories are
made. Become friends with someone who has a room
facing the quad. Those windows are the best place for
people wathching. Domino’s will take at least $100 from
you by the year’s end. Roommates can be wonderful.
There is nothing better than late-night chats about abso-
lutely nothing with people you never thought you’d meet.

D-Hall

The food may seem great and endless, but six months
and 20 pounds from now things will seem a little bit
different. A word on University Cards: Dont ever forget
them and don’t lose them. Bad things will happen to you,
trust me. lt’s $10 to replace the sucker (I lost mine three
times freshman year.) Actually there’s more bad news
about that card the picture is permanent, so even now when
I show my ID, people see my foolish freshman face.

Apricot Glazed Pork Loin will appear on the menu
once too often for comfort. Theme nights: Teh quality of
the food does not improve in propotions to the number of
square dancers whirling by your table. The midnight feast
during exam week is a must. I mean a must.

The Greeks

I thought Greeks were a figment of Hollywood’s
imagination — having created such great films as “Animal
House” and of course, the Nerds series. I hadn’t a clue
about the extent or reach of the fraternity system. The free
beer, great bands and innumerable formal events explain
the long tradition of the Greek system at W&L. I must warn

Beta’s charter

‘V

.suspended

BY KATHRYN MAYURNIK
AND JULIEANN ULIN
TNEWS EDITOR/STAEE WRITER
In 1996, they lost a senior. In
1997, a freshman. This fall, Beta
Theta Pi almost lost its charter.
This summer, Beta’s National
‘(Fraternity suspended the Washing-
ton and Lee’s chapter's charter at the
Beta National Convention until it
institutes an effective risk—manage-
Vment program.

L Beta has gone through both uni-
versity and IFC probationary pun-
ishments, but had never been repri-
manded by its national fraternity.

‘I

“Due to the events ofthe past two
years, namely the alcohol-related
deaths of two of our brothers and
two rowdy Christmas weekends,
Nationals felt that we needed a bet-
ter risk management strategy,” Beta
President Tom Fallace said. “Con-
sidering all that’s happened, I can
see where Nationals is coming
from.”

W&L President John Elrod
called the suspension“appropriate.”

“I hope that Beta can clean up its
act and set an example for the en-
tire fraternity system in learning to
manage its alcohol effectively,”

Street. JOE B.4RA1<A7/RING-Ti/M P1-II '

Elrod said.

Prior to the involvement of
Beta’s national fraternity, the W&L
chapter was placed on social pro-
bation by the university last winter
term after its Christmas weekend
parties got out of control.

Social probation forbids parties
within the house as well as in the
surrounding country areas that are
sponsored by the fraternity. As well
as being placed on social probation,
Beta was warned by the administra-
tion as well as its faculty advisors,
Elrod said.

However, Nationals felt that
W&L wasn’t doing enough to cor-
rect Beta’s problems, Fallace said.

“But, the new BYOB policy will
correct most of our problems,”
Fallace said.

The Interfratemity Counoil insti-
tuted a “Bring Your Own Booze”
policy at the end of last year, pre-
venting fraternities from using
house funds to purchase alcohol.
Alcohol at parties must be pur-
chased by those attending or indi-
vidual brothers. Some fraternities
use a tag bar, while others started a
ticket system.

Beta’s national fraternity gave
the W&L chapter suggestions to
combine with the BYOB policy. “I
think that this will be cleared up in
the next three weeks,” Fallace said.

‘Female cadet hits
‘upperclassman,
‘receives suspension Water polo dead at age of 20

i BY HEATHER MCDONALD

he public eye turns yet again to Virginia Military

Institute this week. VMI’s Executive Committee

suspended a freshman female cadet last Monday
'{ for striking Cadet John Deem during ritualized hazing

on the “Rat Line.”
Sources say that Angelica Garza, I8

insulting them in some manner.

Rumors have circulated since and an anony-
mous source confirms that Garza stated that she

( had premenstrual syndrome before
ran away.

She has been suspended for two semesters and will
be allowed to return next year, although she will have to

re—enter the rat line.

"' Sources also say that Garza’s penalty entails that she
attend therapy and receive doctor approval that she is

mentally able to return to VMI.
The punishment was determined by

Committee, which is solely run by the Corps ofCadets.
Like Washington and Lee’s EC, there is no influence

from the administration.

“A cadet hitting another cadet has happened in the
past,” VMI Director of Public Relations Col. Michael
*' Strickler said. “However, it is not an everyday occur-

rence.”

A similar incident occurred a few years ago when a
sophomore struck a rat. He was also suspended for two

semesters.

“We can’t have cadets going around hitting each
other,” Assistant to the Superintendent Lt. David Zirkle
said. “I am happy with the decision of the Executive
Committee. It was handled in the appropriate manner.”

Both Strikler and Zirkle claim that incident has

nothing to do with gender.

“The system is working as it should,
“Gender has nothing to do with it,” Strickler said.

A VMI junior speaking under the condition of

In one of the last weddings of the busy summer season at Lee Chapel, U.S. Coast Guard Lt. David Sprzmt, ’85,
and his bride were married Saturday, Sept. 13. Many alumni return from all over the country to get hitched

BY ]AsON ZACHER
——-e———— EXECUTIVE EDITOR

The 15 members of the varsity wa-
ter polo team returned to campus this
fall missing only one thing - their team.

After an evaluation of the aquatics
program at the school, Athletic Direc-
tor Mike Walsh made the decision in
July to offer water polo at the club
level instead of the varsity level.

“This was a very difficult decision
to make because of the number of out-
standing athletes who have represented
Washington and Lee in water polo over
the last 20 years,” Walsh said.

“However, our department is com-
mitted to Division III competition and
there simply are not enough varsity
Division III schools to compete
against in water polo.”

The move follows the departure of
Aquatics Director Page Remillard,
who took the job of Athletic Director
at Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Ga.

“I think it’s outrageous,” said senior
water polo captain Ben Yemini. “They
have been considering the fate of wa-
ter polo for a while, and when Remillard
left, it gave them a window.”

While the water polo alumni sup-
port the university, the decision came
as shock to them.

“This decision has ripped the heart
out of W&L for me,” said water polo
alumni Stu Sheldon. “Competing
against those ‘better’ Division I pro-
grams pay me dividends every day of
my life.”

According to several alumni, one
of the reasons expressed by Walsh for
dropping the team was the inability
to win a national title. This point is

held in contention by many of the
players.

Despite the decision to drop to
club, the team is still eligible to play
at the Division III championship.

“The fact that Washington & Lee
may never hope to hang a Division I
National Championship banner at our
pool, does not mean that the challenge
is not worth undertaking,” said alumni
Michael Foley in a letter to Walsh.
“Sometimes a slingshot and a rock can
produce surprising results. That’s
what Washington and Lee University
Athletics used to be about.”

“Since when are Washington and
Lee athletics all about winning?"
asked Yemini. “My roommate plays
basketball and said they’ve only won
five games in two years. but nobody
is considering dropping them.”

Water polo was the 13th varsity
sport at W&L when it was created in
1977. Over the 20 years of its exist-
ence, the team has compiled a record
of 347-203-1. Since 1994. W&L has
played primarily against Division I
and II opponents and has gone I4-37
against varsity competition. Last sea-
son, they compiled a 1-12 record.

According to Yemini. the team
simply had a bad season last year. but
this year, a Division III championship
is possible. Despite the poor records
ofthe past few years against the Divi-
sion I competition, he contends that
the experience of playing at that level
is more valuable than winning na-
tional titles.

eries of thefts sweeps

campus, one arrest made

BY JULIE BONACROSKY
-—-———--—-—-—-—- STAFF EDITOR

Locking car doors and dorm rooms
never used to part of Washington and
Lee campus life. But with the recent
onslaught ofthefts amounting to ap-
proximately $2,500 in cash and be-
longings, it is now a necessity.

A 19-year-old local white male
has been arrested for the theft of

$448 in cash from the Woods -

Creek Apartments. The alleged
thief was able to enter the apart-
ments without an University Card
because he was a friend of resi-
dents of Woods Creek. All but $8
was returned. V

But the culprit of other campus and
off campus thefts remains at large.
$400 was stolen from Baker, Davis
and Gaines dormitories. No arrests
have been made in those cases, but
W&L Assistant Director of Security
Steve Tomlinson believes that the
crimes are related.

“I believe all the thefts are con-
nected and the man who was arrested
is just not owning up to the other
thefts,” Tomlinson said.

There have also been several
thefts from parking lots through-
out Lexington. On Sept. 5, sopho-
more Kevin Stevenson parked his
car in the Gaines Hall parking lot
around 1 p.m.

At approximately 5 p.m. the next
day, he returned to find numerous
CD’s and his portable CD player miss-
ing. '

LEE CHAPEL

On September 6, a musical key-
board was stolen from a car in the
parking lot between Gaines Hall and
St. Patrick’s Church. The driver’s side
door was unlocked.

Three cars parked in the 306
McLaughlin Street apartments were
broken into Tuesday night. An open-
top Jeep belonging to the landlord,
Harry Swisher, was stolen in addition
to three car break-ins.

$50 was taken from senior Melody
Andreola’s 1997 Ford Taurus.

“I’m from a big city and I should
have known to lock my doors,”
Andreola said. “But I think what
scares me more than someone break-
ing into my car is that the car was
parked a few yards from my bedroom
window.”

A car stereo was stolen from an-
other car in that apartment complex,
and nothing was taken from the third.

The thefts are also being inves-
tigated in conjunction with the
Lexington Police Department, but
whether the same person is re-
sponsible for all the thefts is un-
known.

“We hope to bring this to rest real
soon,” Lexington Police Chief Beard
said.

In the meanwhile, the Lexing-
ton PD has stepped up its patrols
in order to prevent further thefts.

“Keep your doors locked at all
times, be aware of your surroundings
and don’t invite people into your
house if you don’t know them,” Beard
said.

Outing Club
to raffle bike

BY KATHRYN MAYURNIK

NEWS EDITOR

Having some trouble getting around Lexington? If so,
a $5 donation to the Outing Club can solve all your trans-
portation needs.

The Outing Club will be selling rafﬂe tickets for a Trek
mountain bike donated by the Lexington Bike Shop and
G&S Publishing. The tickets are $5 and are on sale Mon-
day and Tuesday outside the Co-op. The drawing will be
at the Outing Club meeting Tuesday at 7 p.m.

G&S Publishing was started by senior Galean
Brown and sophomore Stephanie Lefﬂer over the
summer. Brown and Leffler put together a Greek
Directory and financed the printing costs with the
financial help of most of fraternities and sororities
and advertisements. The Lexington Bike Shop paid
for their ad with the bike. In turn, Brown and Leffler
donated the bike to the Outing Club.

W&L NAMES NEW DIRECTOR FOR INTERNATIONAL
EDUCATION

William G. Klingelhofer has been named director for international edu-
cation at W&L. The new administrative position was creative at W&L this
year to meet the increasing demands and importance of international pro-
grams at the university. Klingelhofer will work with students, faculty and
visiting scholars to raise the awareness of all facets of international educa-
tion. He will also head all study abroad programs and will oversee the
university’s efforts to support international students in and out of the class-
room. He will also assist the faculty in procuring grants, arranging intema—
tional exchanges and recruiting international scholars as visiting profes-
sors.

Klingelhofer received his B.A. in 1977 from the University of Washington
where he majored in the history of religion. He holds an M.A. and Ph.D. from
Harvard University with specialization in architectural history and Asian art,
with additional special interests in ancient, medieval and Islamic art. He is
also the author of The Harvard College Guide to International Experience.

‘CANTERBURY TALES’ TRAVELS TO LEXINGTON

Derek Pearsall, Gurney Professor of English at Harvard University, will
deliver the annual Shannon-Clark lecture at W&L Tuesday, Sept. 25, at 8
p.m. in the Leybum Library’s Northern Auditorium. Pearsall’s topic is
“Chaucer and Englishness.” A reception will follow in the Boatright Room;
the public is invited to both.

A native of England, Pearsall was educated at the University of Bir-
mingham. His teaching career has led him from King’s College, to the
University of London, to the University of York, where he was co-director
of the Center of Medieval Studies, to Harvard University.

He is the author or editor of nine books on medieval English literature,
including “The Life ofGeoffrey Chaucer: A Critical Biography and editons
of “Piers Plowman”, “The Canterbury Tales”, and numerous other Middle
English texts. He also reviews dramatic productions for the “Village Voice.”

The Shannon-Clark Lectures in English, established by a gift from an
anonymous W&L alumnus, honor the memories of Edgar Finley Shannon,
chairman ofthe English department from 1914 until his death in 193 8, and
Harriet Mabel Fishbum Clark, a grandmother ofthe donor and a woman
vitally interested in liberal education.

Football has strong showing in 34-28 loss

BY CHRIS PUGSIEY

STAFFWRITBR

What was the number one attrac-
tion in Baltimore, Maryland Saturday
afternoon? No, it wasn’t the series
between the Orioles and the Yankees
or the fact that Maryland was playing
at Florida State in football. It was the
Washington and Lee Generals’ sea-
son opener at Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity. Unfortunately, the Generals
came up short losing 34-28 in a game
almost completely dominated by the
Blue Jays.

The ﬁrst half of action saw the Blue
Jays gain over one hundred more to-
tal yards than the Generals but W&L
only trailed 7-3. The Generals’ of-
fense exploded in the second quarter.
After a Blue Jay turnover, sophomore
quarterback Christian Batcheller

found J .T. Malatesta on a ﬁfteen-yard
fade pattern into the right comer of
the end zone for the Generals ﬁrst
touchdown of the season and
Malatesta’s first of his career.

Senior running back Seth
McKinley took advantage of another
Blue Jay turnover and ran the ball into
the end zone from 15 yards out to ex-
tend the Generals’ lead to 17-7. Af-
ter mounting a long drive, the Blue
Jays closed the gap to 17-14. But,
after a driving down to the Blue Jays
23 yard line the Generals’ Matt
Holbrook kicked a forty yard ﬁeld
goal with time running out showing
the Generals have an effective two
minute drill.

The second half was not as pleas-
ant as the first for the Generals. After

Going into last weekend’s seventh annual W&L Invi-
tational, head volleyball coach Terri Dadio knew that the
team that would present the biggest challenge to her Gen-
erals winning a third straight tournament title would be

Johns Hopkins. She was right.

Hopkins defeated the Generals in Saturday’s champi-
onship game 15-5, 13-15, 15-3, 15-3, snapping their streak
of consecutive home wins, which had spanned three sea-

sons, at 23 games.

In the first game, the Generals were able tojump to a
quick 5-0 lead behind several powerful kills from sopho-
more Nancy Reinhart and a strong defense up front.
Hopkins was able to slowly close the gap, however, and
ultimately rolled off 15 straight unanswered points cour-
tesy of several defensive miscues by the Generals come
back from an early 8-2 deﬁcit behind service points from
senior Ali Beard, Reinhart, and freshman Mary Beth
Brookby. After trading points and sideouts, a kill by se-
nior Holly Thomsen and a subsequent out-of-bounds spike
by Hopkins gave the Generals the 15-13 victory.

The team was unable to capitalize on their success in
the second game, however. Game three was back and forth
early, with Hopkins able to grab a 6-2 lead. Hopkins then
exploded, pushing their lead to 13-3 before Holly
Thomsen’s spike ended the streak. Hopkins ultimately
coasted to a 15-3 win -- a score that they duplicated in
game ﬁve, in which the Generals were able to gain only
brief momentum to win the match and the tournament.

Despite the disappointing ﬁnish, the Generals played
well throughout the Invitational. In their ﬁrst match, they
demonstrated their ability to function as a cohesive unit
while routing Mary Baldwin 15-12, 15-3, 15-0 behind a
dominating offense lead by Nancy Reinhart. Against a
tough North Carolina-Wesleyan squad, the Generals pulled
out a 15-4, 12-15, 15-7, 8-15, 16-14 marathon victory, and
in the third game they posted an easy victory over Catho-

lic University, 15-2, 15-13, 15-9.

Tuesday, the Generals, who were ranked #1 in the pre-
season ODAC volleyball poll, travel to Emory & Henry
Tuesday; they return home on Thursday to face Sweet Briar

at 6:30 p.m. in the Warner Center.

extended the lead to 28-21. But af-
ter that it was all uphill for the Gen-
erals. The Generals held onto a slim
28-27 lead in the fourth quarter, but
the Blue Jays used two key drives to
add thirteenmore points to the score
and ﬁnally defeat a scrappy Gener-
als team.

Batcheller, making his ﬁrst career
start, was 13-25 for 239 yards and
two touchdowns to lead the offense.
Holbrook was 2/2 on PATs and also
added two ﬁeld goals, while senior
comerback John Benazzi had an in-
terception to lead the defense.

However, this game says one
thing: the Generals may have lost but
they will be competitive for the rest
of the season. The Generals’ ﬁrst
home game will be this Saturday at
Wilson Field at 1 p.m. against
Guilford College.

Women’s soccer posts two wins

Junior Karin Treese boots two hat tricks in
games against Randolph-Macon and Kenyon

BY FRANCES GROBERG

 

AFFWRITER

It seems that a long summer has not
affected junior Karin Treese in the
least. Instead, she has started this sea-
son on the same note that she ended in
1996.

“I can’t say enough about Treese.
She’s awesome,” exclaimed senior co-
captain Lorraine Taurassi.

Treese led the women’s soccer team
this weekend to its ﬁrst two victories
of the season over Kenyon College and
Randolph-Macon Women’s College.
Her two hat tricks, on Saturday against
Kenyon, and again on Sunday against
RMWC, helped the Generals start their
season with a 2-0 record.

On Sunday, Randolph-Macon be-
came the second team to fall to the
Generals by a score of four to two. The
end of the ﬁrst half saw the Generals
with a 3-1 margin, despite a sluggish
performance.

“We were tired in the first half,” said
Taurassi, “but we sat down at halftime
and discussed what we needed to do.
We may not have scored as many goals
in the second half, but we were the
dominant team.”

The halftime discussion worked. In
the second half, the Generals played
much more aggressively and the ball
almost never entered W&L’s side of
the ﬁeld. Offensively, the Generals

kept intense pressure on the RMWC
goal, forcing Wildcats’ goalie Kirsten
Bakken to make several terriﬁc saves
to keep the Generals from making the
gap even wider. The offensive pres-
sure included four W&L shots which
struck the crossbar of the goal. Sopho-
more Deidre Coyle scored the other
goal for the Generals.

Kenyon College was the Generals’
first conquest of the weekend. Though
Kenyon Shannon Moroney scored just
53 seconds into Saturday’s game to
take a 1-0 lead over W&L, the Gen-
erals commanded the game from that
point on.

It took senior Erica Reineke only
ﬁve minutes to answer with a goal of
her own off a cross from junior
Caroline Keen. From that point on,
the team rolled to an easy ﬁve to one
victory over Kenyon. Keen and se-
nior Erica Reineke each added a goal
to the effort, and sophomore goalie
Stephanie McKnight was solid with
ﬁve saves.

“Saturday was incredible,” said
Taurassi. “We played so well to-
gether.”

This Thursday, the team will travel
to Hollins College for its ﬁrst away
game of the season, and will be back
on campus Saturday, September 20
for a game against Virginia Wesleyan
on the Liberty Hall Fields at 2:00 p.m.

The
Big

Fan

Bookwalter

Welcome back to the land of the
big fan for the fourth year. I’m start-
ing to feel as old as Larry Holmes.
For those of you who are not famil-
iar with this space, I am the Big Fan,
and each week I will blow some wind
about the national sports scene as well
as an occasional commentary about
W&L sports.

I don’t want to start the year on a

sad note, but it is hard not to notice the
death of Richie Ashbum last Tuesday
morning. Ashbum, one of the best
contact hitters in baseball history,
made the Hall of Fame in 1995 and
developed into a Philadelphia icon. For
his ﬁrst ﬁfty years of service to the
Phillies as a player and announcer, I
can remember spending many summer
nights listening to Ashbum and Harry

Kalas announce Phillies games on
TV. Of course, sometimes that
was the only attraction to watch-
ing the games. Ashbum was al-
ways fun to listen to, whether he
was reminiscing about his playing
days, botching Mark
Grudzielanek’s name, or bemoan-
ing umpires’ strike zones. There

Generals’ sports teams ready

Football

The loss of several key players in-
cluding record-breaking quarterback
Brooks Fischer may mean the end of
Generals football to some observers
but don’t tell that to the men in blue.
Coach Frank Miriello begins another
season of ODAC competition with a
young squad powered by several key
returnees.

Fischer’s spot will be filled by
sophomore phenom Christian
Batcheller who possesses not only a
powerful throwing arm but the abil-
ity to read coverage and escape pres-
sure in the pocket. Joining Batcheller
will be senior tailback Seth McKinley
who after suffering injuries each of
the last two seasons looks to put up
big numbers in his ﬁnal campaign.
Junior Chas Chastain leads the Gen-
erals receiving corps and will be
joined by J.T. Malatesta and tight end
David Ritchey.

Backing up this solid offensive
lineup will be a defense that has quite
a reputation to maintain. After the
losses of Robert Hull two years ago
and players like McGuire Boyd and
Peyton Williams, the Generals need
to step up and keep Bacheler’s offen-
sive unit on the ﬁeld. Leading the
defensive returnees will be defensive
lineman Omar Moneim and Matt
Luka who both had solid seasons last
year. The Generals are especially

    

strong at the defensive back position
with Ryan Fletemyer and John
Benazzi who was a first team All-
ODAC selection last year. The Gen-
erals will need this defensive unit to
perform well this season.

Volleyball

“Our primary goal is to get back to
the ODAC tournament championship
 —- ~— -» game and win it,”
head volleyball
 coach Terri Dadio
said.

When you are a
program that has
 been as successful as
the Generals the past
couple of years, such a goal is not as
lofty as it might first seem. Since
Dadio took over in 1993, the volley-
ball team has posted a record of 92-
30, including a 29-6 record in 1995
that was complemented by the team’s
ﬁrst and so far only ODAC champi-
onship. Last year saw a 29-4 record,
an undefeated 19-0 regular season in
the ODAC and a second place ﬁnish
in the conference tournament behind
Bridgewater. As well, the team has
won 20 straight games at Warner
Gymnasium, a streak that spans those
two years.

Coming into this season,_which
began this weekend in the W&L In-

homse V

vitational tournament, the Generals
are the preseason #1 team in the
ODAC according to the conference’s
coaches. The primary reason for this
early honor, according to coach
Dadio, is the team’s experience.
Seven players return from last year,
ﬁve of whom started and all of whom
will see significant playing time.
Only one starter, lst team all-ODAC
middle hitter Virginia Yoerg, was
lost. The team is led by three seniors,
Alison Beard, setter, Hilary Martin,
middle blocker, and Holly Thomsen,
outside hitter, all of whom coach
Dadio called strong leaders. Dadio
also singled out sophomore Nancy
Reinhart as a strong outside hitter and
junior Megan Snodgrass as a valu-
able hitter in both the inside and out-
side positions.

Despite this multitude of experi-
enced returners, however, Dadio said
that several of the six freshmen on
the team must step in right away. “We
will definitely need the freshmen to
come in right away on the front line
for blocking,” she said. “The three I
see making the most immediate im-
pact are Pam Salisbury, an athletic
setter with good hands, Mary Beth
Brookby, a good passer and defen-
sive specialist, and Melissa Williams,
who will have to help out on the front
line right away.

“We deﬁnitely have the talent and
the chemistry to have a very strong

 

team. We are going to take this sea-
son one match at a time and see what
happens,” said Dadio. If their success
in the W&L Invitational is any indi-
cation, one would be hard-pressed not
to believe her.

Women’s Soccer

The women’s soccer team, an im-
posing combination of seasoned vet-
erans and ex-
tremely talented
rookies, is looking
forward to repeat-
ing many of their
1996 accomplish-
merits.

Last year, the
team set a school record for wins with

Treese

for fall‘ seasons

a second place regular season ﬁnish
in the Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence. Coach Jan Hathom, embarking
on her 11th season as the varsity
coach, named virtually all of the up-
per-classmen as top returnees, includ-
ing the newly-elected captains, seniors
Claire Bowers and Lorraine Taurassi
and junior Karin Treese.

Treese, a forward, was a ﬁrst-team
All-ODAC and a second-team All-
South region selection in 1996. Bow-
ers was selected ﬁrst-team All-ODAC
and ﬁrst-team All-State in 1996. Other
top players include senior forward
Erica Reineke, the number 2 all-time
scorer at W&L, and returning sopho-
more goalkeeper Stephanie McKnight.

its and ties may be the way
to land a job ‘on Wall
Street, but Ali Davis got her’s
in a cattle call.

September marks Davis’ one-
year anniversary with The Second
City National Touring Company, the
springboard for the careers of major-
comedians such as Alan Alda

“M.A.S.H.,” Julia Louis-Dreyfuss .

“Seinfeld,” Martin Short “Three
Amigos,” Jim Belushi “Blues Broth-
ers” and a slew of “Saturday Night
Live” stars including Chris Farley and
Mike Myers.

Davis’ job application, like those
of her predecessors, required her par-
ticipation in one of Second City’s
annual “cattle calls,” a grueling ex-
perience where eight strangers are
herded into a room where they have
15 minutes to impress the scruti-
nizing eyes ofjudges with their
improvisational skills. Those
succeed, like Davis, are
roped into an understudy,
position until they can be
branded as an addition to
the tour.

“Saturday Night Live”
uses the Chicago-based orga-
nization as a major recruiting
pool. So, when The_Second
City comes to Washington and
Lee, Friday, September 25, the
Lenfest Center stage may host
some future SNL stars.

At 9 p.m., Davis and her co-
comedians Craig Cacklowsky,
Abby Schachner, Mike Lucas and
John Farley (Chris Farley’s little
brother, although he doesn’t like
to be known as such) will hurl the
audience into the throws oflaugh-
ter with comedic sketches in the
tradition of “Saturday Night
Live.” Without giving audience

members a chance to recover, the
troupe will pull them in to become a
part ofthe show. The audience will
shout out suggestions, and the six ac-
tors will perform their requests with

cause “they are a more knowledge-
able crowd,” so the comedians can
perform sketches from a wider
range of topics.
If W&L students are as knowl-
edgeable as she thinks, they will
be in their seats and
ready to laugh early.
No one turns down

as well as background on the history
and staging ofthe play.

“Everyone Says I Love You”
is Woody Allen’s 26th ﬁlm, but his
first musical. The ﬁlm won acclaim
for the juxtaposition of nostalgic
songs and its contemporary setting
in New York, Venice. Allen
avoided casting professional sing-
ers, so with the exception of Drew
Barrymore, the actors (including
Allen, Tim Roth, Goldie Hawn and

 

Alan Alda) croon the tunes
themselves.

“Everyone knows Woody
Allen!” said Frost. But not every-
one might know another more lo-
cal attraction: senior Molly
Norton’s brother. Edward
Norton, who plays the love in-
terest of Barrymore’s character.

“If it weren’t for the movies
provided by the Film Society,”
Frost noted, “many students
would otherwise avoid foreign and
non-mainstream ﬁlms. Everyone
should try and take advantage of
the screenings because they’re
free movies and the best movies."

Screenings begin at 7:30 in
the Troubadour Cinema on the
corner of Henry and Main. Ad-
mission is free, but contributions
are appreciated.

Hope had decided by the ﬁﬁh grade
that she would drop out of school in the
10th grade just as her mother did.
Hope’s guidance counselor, some-
what troubled by the lack ofdirec-
tion in the young girl’s life, re-
ferred Hope to Lexington’s Big Brother/Big Sister
Outreach Program, part of Washington and Lee’s
University Federation.

Upon meeting the troubled youth, junior Elizabeth
Houston learned that Hope’s favorite pastime was bowling.
“Really?” Houston asked, “Do you bowl a lot?” The young
girl shook her head, “No, I’ve only been twice.”

That aftemoon, Houston took Hope bowling, later de-
scribing the seemingly mundane experience as “incredible”
and “moving.”

“I never would have thought that I could have brought
so much happiness into a little girl’s life,” Houston says.

olu

, “Anything we did, whether it was bowling or the movies or

lunch on the playground, was for Hope the most exciting
thing in her life.”

The Big Brother/ Big Sister program is designed to pro-
vide positive role models for elementary- middle-or high-
school students in Lexington whose parents are either not in
the home or too busy for their children. By sharing quality
time with these area youths, the big brothers and sisters hope
to make a difference and observe positive changes in the
behavior and rationale of the youngsters.

The local program is autonomous from the national
Big Brother/ Sister Program, which necessitates local ini-
tiative here at W&L. Students interested in participating,
should watch for upcoming signs and announcements.
President Matt Craig said, the program is in desperate
need of volunteers, especially boys, that will provide di-
rection and role models for the area’s young people.

Of the several service organiza-
tions in the Lexington area, the
Rockbridge Area Hospice is certainly

S one of the finest. The essential goal
ofthe Hospice is to provide home care
to terminally ill patients. Moreover,

the Hospice fulﬁlls both the spiritual and physical needs
of patients and their families.

Dr. Mimi Elrod, a great admirer of volunteer work,
feels the Hospice is “an absolutely wonderful service. The
patients want to have their loved ones near them and
want to be in familar surroundings.”

There are many ways Washington and Lee students
can become involved with the Hospice. For example, a
student may take on the role of a patient care volunteer
and help care for terminally ill patients who wish to stay
at home. A student could also become a special—events
volunteer. Special events volunteers give out informa-
tion about Hospice speakers and petition for grants. There
are also ofﬁce volunteers, many of whom are W&L stu-
dents, who ﬁle papers and help with computer work.

Because the Hospice is currently holding its 1997 fall
volunteer training program, it’s the ideal time for students to
get involved. Margaret Watkins, who has served at the Hos-
pice for three years, both recruits and supervises the volun-
teers. Watkins explains that her goal for the Hospice is “to
enable them (the patients) to live life fully." She has also
formulated her own personal ideas about the beneﬁts of
volunteerism: “When you help people, you gain back a tre-
mendous amount of knowledge and insight into what people
can cope with under such adversity.“

A future Hospice activity that W&L students can par-
ticipate in is “Hussle for Hospice,” a ﬁve-mile hike around
town. Watkins hopes W&L fraternities and sororities will
sponsor the event to be held on Oct. 19.

 

Open auditions for “Uncle Vanya

The Theatre Department will be holding open auditions for its ﬁrst play
ofthe season, Chekhov’s bittersweet, comic drama “Uncle Vanya.”

Directed by Al Gordon, “Uncle Vanya” provides a moving encounter with
Chehkov’s characters who endure the hardships of provincial Russian life. spiri-
tual isolation and loneliness, but strive for happiness, fulﬁllment and laughter.

Auditions are this Thursday and Friday, 7 p.m. - 9 p.m. in the Johnson
Theatre. Parts are available for five men and four women. Scripts may

when is a German Restaurant
good? When Doug can take
his German mother there and she en-
joys the food. Edelweiss, located
north of Lexington off I-81, offers
tasty German fare at reasonable
prices. The rustic log-cabin atmo-
sphere and authentic music create a
unique experience for those who are
adventurous.
We first visited Edelweiss in
mid-August, stopping in during the
early evening as we drove home from

a friend’s wedding (the source of last week’s dubious
picture). We entered to find a small, intimate atmo-
sphere with seating for 40 patrons.

The hostess quickly seated us at a cozy corner table
and presented an enticing menu. Doug chose the
Sauerbraten, an old family favorite consisting of thin
roast beef in a special sour German sauce, while Robin
selected Rindsrouladen, beef tenderloins wrapped in ba-
con with carrots. Both dishes came with side orders of
green beans, cabbage, red cabbage and spatzel (short,
fat German noodles).

While we waited for our main dishes, we enjoyed
fresh rolls with butter. The main course arrived quickly;
although its appearance lacked the polish found in res-
taurants such as the Sheridan Livery Inn, the food was
tasty and very filling. We lingered over the meal and
after eating so much were unable to partake of dessert.

Since our visit, Doug has returned twice with other
company. He has sampled two dishes, the
Rindsrouladen (which Robin recommended) and the
Huhnerbrust, chicken breasts in a wine sauce. He also
tried the Black Forest Cake and decided it was an ex-
cellent resolution to a delightful meal when combined
with coffee. Doug’s only remaining obstacle is to get
Dirk, his Dutch boss, to accompany him on his next
visit.

Edelweiss, like the Pink Cadillac Diner, requires a
short drive from Lexington, but the unique and deli-
cious food at both these restaurants makes the trip worth-
while.

Edelweiss offers an excellent option for an unusual
date or a night out of town with friends. Go to Staunton
to catch a movie and stop by Edelweiss for some Ger-
man food on the way.

Last winter, Kate Giese, a senior Poli-
tics major, stepped away from the Wash-
ington and Lee lifestyle. After two and a
half years of the same types of classes,
Giese realized the importance of learning
off campus.

Giese participated in a 15-week pro-
gram in Venezuela through the School
of International Training. The program
was divided into three parts. For the
first six weeks, Giese lived with a local
family while studying the Spanish lan-
guage at the University of the Andes in
Meridia. At first, Giese found that her
communication skills were lacking.

“They spoke so fast. Everything
was so overwhelming.”

The experience in Venezuela
opened Giese’s eyes to the differences
and qualities of cultures.

“I found out they have a different
concept of privacy than we do here,”
said Giese. “When I first got there, the
entire family, the father, and all the
brothers, went into my room to unpack
my suitcases.”

 Kate Giese left behind the class-
rooms of Washington and Lee to
learn more about the Spanish
language, ecology and herself

Although the language and culture
barriers were difficult to overcome at
first, the sensitivity of her host family
and the community as a whole encour-
aged Giese while she improved her
communication skills.

The peaceful demeanor of the
people, called tranquillo, greatly struck
Giese as unusual and refreshing. Giese
recalls “riding up in the mountains in old,
beat-up vans that would occasionally
break down. When this happens, every-
one calmly gets out of the van and calmly
waits for the next van.”

Giese’s studies were not conﬁned to
Venezuelan language and culture. Dur-
ing the second part of the program, Giese
examined various ecosystems: the central
plains, the Caribbean coast, the mountain
rainforest and the Andean cloud forest.
For six weeks Giese and the other students
traveled to the different ecosystems to ob-
serve and study.

Giese met students from all over the
world. ‘

“There weren’t many students from
the U.S. Many came from Western Eu-
rope. Russia and Venezuela. Americans
tend to go to Europe; whereas people from

other parts of the world tend to go down
there.”

Although their native cultures and lan-
guages were varied, they shared common
interests, spirit, love for learning and open-
mindedness.

The final three weeks of the program
constituted the Independent Studies
Project. Students were encouraged to
expand their knowledge of a speciﬁc
topic in the region of their choice. Giese
chose to study ﬁshing regulations and
declining ﬁsh populations in the Orinoco
RiverBasin in Llanos. Aﬁerthey ﬁnished,
the students met again in Meridia to share
their projects with each other.

When the 15 weeks were over, Giese
had grown accustomed to her life in Ven-

PAGE 5

ezuela. “I didn't want to leave,” Giese

claims. “I deﬁnitely want to go back.” I

Many of her new ﬁiends stayed and
found internships and job opportunities.
Giese returned to Lexington for the sum-
mer and was a Robert E. Lee Research
Scholar. Recently, she was named one
of 70 national recipients of a Morris K.
Udall Scholarship for environmental
policy.

Giese calls her experience in Ven-
ezuela, “One of the best things I’ve
ever done. I would recommend study
abroad to anyone.”

W&L offers many opportunities to
study abroad. Students should con-
tact Tiffany Cummings in the Ofﬁce
of International Education.

Environmental studies in a less exotic locale

Giese’s program dealt with a topic that is fairly new to the W&L cur-
riculum: Environmental Studies. When Giese entered W&L in 1994, she
was “surprised at the lack of any program for environmental studies.”

In 1995, then Dean of Academic Affairs John Elrod catalyzed the effort to ﬁll
this gap. “He brought people togetherto brainstorm, and then established a commit-
tee,” explained Associate Dean Kenneth Ruscio, now chairman of the Environ-
mental Studies Committee. “The committee came up with a proposal. We’ve been
in the process of implementing that piece by piece over the years.”

The Committee’s intends to establish an environmental studies program
incorporating guest lecturers, special events and an expanded curriculum.

“One of the things the program is trying to do is provide informal

links between study abroad, Outing Club and speakers,” says Ruscio. “We
see this as an interdisciplinary ﬁeld, but still one which requires students
to have a disciplinary base to work from.”

Giese envies students who have the opportunity to participate in the
new program. “It’s great,” she says. “Attitudes around campus have
changed greatly towards environmental issues.”

Other students apparently share Giese’s enthusiasm. “We thought there would
be a high demand, but it’s been beyond our expectations,” admits Ruscio.

The program is open to all majors; its goal is to involve a wide array
of disciplines. Interested students can pick up a copy of the program’s
newsletter in the Williams School, or talk to a committee member.

junior Nicole Johnson, who was
named second—team All-ODAC and
third team A1l—South in 1996. Hathom
is also impressed with the team’s eight
freshmen, who are very capable of
playing on the varsity level. The fresh-
men have played so well that Hathom
feels they have raised the playing level
ofthe entire team.

“This team is the most motivated
I've had in a long time,” Hathom said.
‘‘We’ 11 see what we are made ofin the
next couple of weeks.” '

The women’s soccer team, which
was picked third in the preseason
ODAC coaches poll, beat Kenyon Sat-
urday 1-0, and Randolph-Macon
Women's College 4-1 Sunday.

Men’s_ Soccer

With the returning core of last
year’s record setting 12-6 team and an
incoming wealth of freshmen talent,
W&L’s men's soccer team should be
vying for the ODAC championship for
the second year in a row.

This year’s team boasts three re-
turning All-ODAC performers, as well
eight other veterans from last year’s
squad which ﬁnished second in the
ODAC tournament. The defense, al-
ways a strong point for W&L soccer,
will be anchored again this year by
All-American sweeper Michael
Parker. With Senior Kingsly Chukwu
and sophomore Ben Thompson secur-

ing the backﬁeld, the defense should’

be solid.

The real story on this team, how-
ever, is the potent offensive threat. In
past years, the team has had trouble
putting the ball in the back of the net.
Not this year, says Coach Rolf
Piranian. “Last year we relied on two
players to do most of our scoring,”
stated Piranian.

“This year, we have four or ﬁve
guys and we expect to score from a

' lot of different places.”

The two guys Piranian was refer-
ring to are junior Sam Chase and
sophomore Jamie Parker. Last year,
Parker broke the school record for

goals and points set by Chase the pre— '

vious year. Chase is already sixth on
the all-time point list with 63.

«The most improved aspect of the
team is the midfield. Experienced
players Mike Germain,‘ Scott
Letourneau and Mike Kaczka should
provide stability to a midﬁeld infused
with new talent. ' ’

The shaky spot for the Generals
may prove to be the lack of experi-
ence at the goalie position. With start-

ing keeper E. J. Murphy sidelined with
an injury, freshman Jordan Ginsberg
will be starting in goal. Ginsberg
looked sharp in a preseason scrim-
mage last Saturday but has not yet
proven himself in league competition.

Men’s Cross Country

Washington and Lee’s Men’s
Cross Country program, a virtual
mainstay at the university since 1915,
embarks on its 83rd year of competi-
tion this fall with many expectations
and few question marks. Head Coach
John Tucker believes that this year's
strong senior class (Jason Callen, Will
Olsen, Greg Ruthig, and Taylor
Shultz), coupled with last season's
disappointing 2nd place ﬁnish in the
conference should have the Generals
in the thick of things for athird ODAC
championship in the past four years
and a possible NCAA Division III
championship berth. The team quali-
ﬁed for the NCAAs in 1995 and won
consecutive ODAC championships in
1994 and 1995 before last season’s
setback. .

Senior Jason Callen has been All-
Region, All-State, and All-ODAC
each of his ﬁrst three years and was
the ODAC Runner of the Year in
1995. Senior Will Olson was All-State
and All-ODAC after ﬁnishing second
in the two races. Senior Taylor Shultz
has been All-state has been for the past
two years and was All-Region in
1995. Junior Darrick Alford is a key
returner and freshman Alex Taylor
should also be a nice addition to an
already talented squad. '

Women’s Cross Country

The traditionally strong Washing-
ton and Lee Women’s Cross Country
program kicks off a new season this
fall with high hopes of defending its
ODAC championship of last season.
In fact, Head Coach Jim Phemister’s
Generals have become somewhat of
a dynasty in ODAC competition, win-
ning four out of the last ﬁve champi-
onships. Hoping to pave the way for
this year's squad is senior Carson
Flowers, who was ODAC Runner of
the Year last season and also earned
All-State honors. Other top returnees
include juniors Lisa Brennan and
Natasha Dorofeeva. Brennan was All-
ODAC last year after running sixth at
the conference championship meet
and Dorofeeva has been All-State
each of her ﬁrst two seasons after ﬁn-
ishing second both times.

was never a dull moment with Whitey
in the booth.

Ironically, the day ofhis death, the
Phillies were playing the Mets, the
team Ashbum ﬁnished his career with
in 1962 and the worst team in base-
ball history. And the Phillies won 1-
0 that night. Ashbum wore #1 with
the Phillies. We’ll miss you, Whitey.

I'll now devote the rest of this
week’s space to recapping the good,
the bad and the ugly events of the
summer of 1997:

The Good: *Who can forget Davis
Love III’s triumphant walk to the 18th
green at the PGA Championship with
the rainbow overhead? The rainbow
symbolized the end of a long drought
for Love, who was often labeled the
best player never to win a major
championship

*The Pittsburgh Pirates and Mil-
waukee Brewers, two small-market
baseball franchises who are constantly
rebuilding, have contended for the
ﬁrst place in their divisions through
out the summer.

The Bad: *While the Brewers hung
with the Indians in the AL central, the
large-market White Sox waved the
surrender flag and dismantled their
team, trading Wilson Alvarez and
Roberto Hernandez, even though they
were only 31/2 games out of the ﬁrst
at the time. Too bad they didn’t dump
Belle.

*Jerry Jones bragged all through
training camp about how he was re-
making the Cowboys’ image. It so
inspired Deion Sanders that he de-
cided to become a minister and

Sports

SEPTEMBER 15, 1997

Michael Irvin decided he liked foot-
ball again. Too bad Jerry didn’t tell
Barry Switzer. Switzer, who usually
plays four cards short of a full deck,
tried to pass through an airport metal
detector with a hand gun. Like that
would have frightened anybody. The
Cowboys ended camp by trashing
their dorms and urinating on the car-
pet. Yup, same ol’ Boys.

*Old favorite Allen Iverson, per-
haps thinking he was on the I-81
dragstrip between Lexington and
Roanoke, was in a car that was
stopped for going 93 in a 65 mile an
hour zone east of Richmond. With
marijuana on the car ﬂoor, no less.

The Ugly: *The Mike Tyson-
Evander Holyﬁeld horror show. I’ll
spare the cliches.

*Mount Bryan Cox, which was
only dormant for about nine months,
erupted Labor Day night in Green
Bay. Cox, who rampaged his way to
THREE unsportsmanlike conduct
penalties, including two on the same
play, acted so foolishly that his own
wife wouldn't speak to him for sev-
eral days.

*Washington’s Mike Westbrook
turned into one of Compton's Most
Wanted after his bloody, apparently
unprovoked, attack on teammate
Stephen Davis. Coach Norv Turner
then had to remind Westbrook that he
was in Westminster, Maryland, not
South Central, LA. God help us all if
West brook and Davis ever step onto
the same offensive huddle this season.
It could ignite the ﬁrst bench—clear—
ing brawl in NFL history involving
only one team.

Killin’ Catholic
Sophomore Nancy Reinhart scores a kill against Catholic on Saturday
in the Washington & Lee Invitational Volleyball Tournament. W&L
went on to win the game 15-2, 15-13, 15-9.

The incident has made me more aware of my
‘’ security on campus. For the most part, W&L seems
._ to be one of the safer campuses in the country. I feel
‘comfortable walking back to my apartment late at
- night, and until now, my only reason for locking my
i, doors would have been to keep drunken students
7. from mistakenly wandering into my room.
Despite the loss of my possessions, I still feel
‘ fairly secure on campus, thanks to both W&L Secu-
“ rity and the Honor System. I feel safe knowing that
:1 do not have to protect myself from my fellow
: students. I enjoy the sense of ease and community
 which accompanies the knowledge that my col-
f leagues are upright and honest.
However, my loss has taught me a few lessons.
First, I have come to realize that the Honor System
extends only to members of the W&L community. Sec-
ond, and more importantly, I have learned that I live in a
community, not a fortress. We are not impervious to

Protecting ourselves

The September 9 issue of The Ring-tum Phi
; warned that more than $700 in cash had been taken
from campus residences and parking lots during the
past week. Unfortunately», I did not read the warning
until Tuesday afternoon: over the weekend, I may
have been robbed.
It seems likely that I was. On Tuesday morning,
I discovered that the cash which I had brought with
me to school was missing from my room. Although
it is possible that I simply misplaced my money, it
. seems more likely that it was taken from me. When
I reported the possible theft to Washington and Lee
Security, 1 was told that someone had been caught
1 taking cash, but not property, from students’ rooms.
My case matched those of the criminal’s other vic-
tims. My money was probably among the cash which

. visits from less honest members of society.

 

For this reason, you may want to take steps to protect

yourself from theft.
9 First, lock the door to your dorm room or apartment.
, The convenience of an unlocked door is not worth the loss
of your possessions. Carrying your key with you is not a
burden and locking your door can’t hurt.
Second, do not prop open the doors to the dormi-
tories and on-campus apartments. The security locks
are there for good reason. Carry your card with you
and allow the doors to lock behind you when you
. leave. You should care enough to not endanger

yourself and others unnecessarily.

Last, if you see someone in the campus residences
ho does not look as though they belong there, do
&L Security a favor: give them a call. They can
etter protect us if they know who needs protection.
I would like to thank W&L Security for the friendli-
ness and understanding they have shown me. I hope that
hey will understand when I do my best to never

return to their office.

Our attitudes, not just our rules, must change

“If [the BYOB policy] is enforced,
alcohol abuse at W&L will disappear. ” —
President John Elrod

If only it were that simple.

 

If alcohol abuse and the problems as-
sociated with it simply could be legislated
away, it would have been done a long time
ago. Unfortunately, problems like this
one cannot be handled merely with rules.

On the other hand, something must be
done. Washington and Lee has had two
alcohol-related deaths in the last two years,
which is both a terrible tragedy and com-
pletely unacceptable. While it is far too
early to tell, I thinkthe BYOB regulations

tions succeed only in causing individuals
to consider the liability they face if some-
thing happens to a person they have pro-

vided with alcohol, C‘

ofthe decline can be attributed to tougher
laws and more vigilantenforcement. More
importantly, a stigma has been attached

to drunken driving

then the new rules are
worth it.

Rules alone, how-
ever, are not the an-
swer. One famous ex-
ample is the failure of
Prohibition in the

1920s and ’30s. Alco-

_ hol use and abuse continued throughout

the period. The Roaring Twenties
“roared” because people loved to party.
Most Americans saw drinking as accept-
able, even fashionable. No law could
change those engrained beliefs.
Another example is the recent success
in curbing the number ofdrunken driving

the destruction

caused by drunken drivers, showing

pictures of the mothers and adorable

young children killed in drunken driv-

ing accidents, have a greater effect
than any law ever could.

W&L, in many respects, is very similar

to the Roaring Twenties. Our unofficial

motto is “Work Hard, Play Hard,” and we

engrained in our culture. BYOB will not
change that, nor should it.

What has to change is our belief in
our own invincibility. If you’re so
drunk that you try to unlock the door
to someone else’s car, don’t drive
home. Even if you’re not driving
home, you probably didn’t need that
last beer, especially if it was your
twentieth. If that last beer was your
sixth or seventh, why tempt fate by
driving?

Don’t let your friends tempt fate, ei-
ther. If they need to be cut off, cut them
off. lfyou have to wrestlethe car keys out
of their hands, do it. Sure, they’ll prob-
ably laugh at you or yell at you or even try
to deck you. Personally, I’d rather
have my best friend kick my ass than
attend his funeral.

Taking a lesson in
Dubyuhliberalism

Since this is my first column of
the year, I thought that I would use
this opportunity to conduct my
own type of orientation.

 

Freshmen need time to adjust
to the fact that there actually is a
liberal Washington and Lee stu-
dent who will put her name on this
column twice a month. But before
you decide that I am “evil” or
“subversive” for being a Liberal
and a Democrat, I wanted to give
you some background about this
column. W&L — even you —
may not be as conservative as
you think.

Besides the Hollywood—esque
glamour of working for the Phi,
my original intent in writing
“From the Left” was to provide a
counterpoint to conservative, en-
trenched W&L views and maybe
win over a few converts to the
liberal cause in the process. I have
tried to inform readers about cur-
rent national events, present them

in a relatively coherent way, stir
up some critical thinking and
spark some much needed debate in
this “Land 0’ Conformists.”

It wasn’t until right before I
wrote my ﬁnal column of last year
that I realized it is impossible to
change anyone’s mind unless
people actually read what I write.
A friend’s offhanded comment
brought it all home for me: “I read
your column when it’s not about
politics.” This was humorous,
because all my columns were
about politics.

So, my big epiphany was: don’t
write about politics. To those
who scurry around the science
building, a discussion about fed-
eral welfare benefits and educa-
tion reform may be a bit dry. It’s
understandable. To serve my pur-
pose of inciting some much needed
debate on campus, I propose to
alter my range of inquiry and writ-
ing. I will leave the national mat-
ters to the professional pundits
and turn my attention to more rel-
evant, campus matters.

W&L campus politics” should not
be construed to mean that I want
W&L to become an Amherst
clone. Our school has endured for
250 years. Obviously, somebody
must be doing something right.

However, W&L’s forthcoming
bicenquinquadenary sometimes
acts as a curse. A prevalent mind-
set on campus is that if we have
made it this far, then what’s the
need for change? W&L has al-
ways been conservative—isn’t
that the way it should stay?

But consider this: up until ten
years ago, W&L had enrolled only

male students. Obviously, that has
changed. I think that I have, at the
absolute least, the support of 45
percent of the campus when I say
that W&L is better as a co—ed in-
stitution. Changecanbeagoodthing.

I do not propose to tear down
the Colonnade and build a mini-
mall with the Blockbuster Video
and Dairy Queen that we have
been promised for the past two
years. That type of change is not
good. I would rather motivate and
change the opinions of a few. Ifl
make at least one person angry
enough to write me a letter to tell

me that I am dead wrong, I will
have accomplished something.

I hope my column can incite
some to take a second look. I
know that I am asking a lot. But
as college students ~— young,
talented and damn smart — we
owe it to ourselves and our gen-
eration to effect great change.
We are all wasting away in our
inactivity and passiveness. Be-
fore it is too late, before we all go
off to be doctors, lawyers and
investment bankers, let’s get ac-
tive. Let’s get involved. Let’s
stand up for what we believe in.

Susan Shady, who has been following the cast

Susan?”

Susan Shady: “This has been a very busy
day forthecast of ‘Friends.’ David Schwimmer
started his day by driving to the local bakery.
We can’t say at this point what he bought, but
it’s probably some sort of baked goods.”

A: “Bread, perhaps?”

SS: “It’s too early to say. I wouldn’t want
to jump to any conclusions.”

A: “What about the other ‘Friends’?”

SS: “Well, Courtney Cox went to the local
supermarket. We interviewed the guy who
bagged her groceries and he said that she got
Rice Krispies, milk and a melon.”

A: “It sounds like breakfast. Would it be
fair to assume she might eat this breakfast
after, say, a night of hot sex with Ricardo
Montban?”

SS: “I would say so.”

A: “Fascinating. You heard it here, folks.
Courtney Cox is sleeping with Ricardo

 

Montban. Any other ‘Friends’ activity,
Susan?”

SS: “Well, Matthew Perry and Lisa Kudrow
were in court today obtaining a restraining
order against us.”

A: “Would it be fair to say that Matthew
Perry and Lisa Kudrow are sleeping with
each other?”

SS: “It certainly would be.”

A: “And what about that other guy?”

SS: “Matt LeBlanc? We haven’t seen him
all day.”

A: “So, it’s possible that he’s been at home
all day, having hot sex with Michael Jackson
and his llama?”

SS: “Possible and very likely. We haven’t
seen Michael Jackson either. Or the llama.”

A: “Outstanding. Isn’t there a sixth
‘Friend’?”

SS: “Yes, Jennifer Aniston. As you’ll
remember from last week’s report, Jennifer
Aniston is acutally an alien from the planet
Zorbarollia.”

A:“Yes,yes,butwhoisshesleepingwith?”

SS: “Um, I don’t know...uh...the drummer

for...uh...Led Zeppelin.”

A: “Fascinating! Jennifer Aniston, who’s
real name is Nodar, is sleeping with deceased
Led Zeppelin drummer John ‘Bonzo’
Bonham.”

SS: “Oh, he died?”

A: “Yes. It is obviousthat the Zorbarollians
have a way of_reviving the dead. Perhaps
Jesus was actually resurrected by
Zorbarollians. What a shocking revelation
for the millions of Christians around the
globe. Who knows what this...”

(Handed paper from off camera.)

A: “Excuse me, thisjust in, thisjust in: OJ
Simpson’s third grade teacher’s cousin has
finally come out of hiding and is speaking to
the press! We break from our ‘Friends’
coverage to bring you this important
breaking story.”

The moral of this story is that the show
“Hard Copy” sucks. Another moral is that
Jennifer Aniston is probably from another
planet because I’ve lived on Earth for 19
years and never seen a woman who looks that
good. Please do not attach any other morals
to this story. Please do not feed the story to
pets, small children or fat guys. Store story at
room temperature. Keep story away from
eyes. If rash occurs, consult your doctor.

whether I am the only one who con- -

reminds me ofa story I heard from one
of the entities living in my brain:
Apparently, this entity was the
soul of a man named John who was
formerly employed in a frame manu-
facturing plant. Each day of work was
an infinite line of wooden strips tha

the conveyor, each separate strip of

wood anxiously made its way toward

whether the wood was “good” or
“bad.” The worst pieces of wood were

the best were saved for John’s great
plan.

Being the Great Unitor, John
thought that he needed something to
testify to his unbounded power, and
his answer was: The Giant Frame.
John used only the best pieces ofwood
tocreateaframethatwaslarge enough
to encase his body within its borders.
This blasphemous display by John
infuriated the almighty power, who
then transformed John’s body into
canvas and oil paints which would
remain within the frame, and relegated
his soul into the tenth circle of hell, the
one that Dante forgot: my mind. It is
there that poor John must spend an
eternity, suffering in ways which
would take pages to describe, how-
ever since I only have a few words
left, I end with a quote from a Kurt
Vonnegut Jr. book: “So it goes.”
