WAL students must prove they
are residents of the district in which
they attend school in order to meet
the requirements of voter registra-
tion in that area. As reported in the
News-Gazette, Virginia Attorney
General Andrew P. Miller delivered
his opinion to Mrs. Gerald S. Ma-
han, president of the State electoral
board, in a letter dated in late July.

The question of whether or not a
college student may vote in his cam-
pus community has become a hot
political issue ever since a court-
ordered ban on California residency
requirements resulted in a radical
majority in Berkeley's city govern-
ment, Since 18-year-olds may now
vote with the June ratification of the
twenty-sixth amendment, similar reg-
istration drives, as took place in
Berkeley, could produce a similar
effect in other college towns with
swollen student rolls, such as Am-
herst. Massachusetts, Gainesville,
Florida, or Princeton, New Jersey.

Locally, students in both Lexing-
tion and Charlottesville have com-
plained that, if taxed by their cam-
pus community, they deserve some
voice in the determination of local
political administration, State laws
on the matter vary widely, accord-
ing to the Richmond News Leader,
whose survey has found that 11
states under no condition allow col-
lege students to participate in town
elections, that 12 states require
proof of financial independence be-
fore registration; and that 11 other
states offer various conditions as ob-
stacles to student voting

According to the News-Gazette,
“the Attorney General's letter placed
the burden of proof of residency on

the student requesting registration
Local registrars, however, must pass

both domicile and abode, and the
difficulty is in determining domicile.

He said that the Virginia Supreme
Court has held that establishment of
new domicility includes physical or
bodily presence in the new locality,
an intent to abandon the old domi-
cile, and a concurrent intent to adopt
another domicile in the new location.

“The first requisite is clearly met
when a student enters a given juris-
diction to attend an institution of
learning,” Mr. Miller stated, “but as
to the second and third requisites,
the registrar must ascertain the in-
tent of the student and manifested

in his words and actions.”

Thus, more than the mere fact of
attending W&L and living in Lex-
ington or Rockbridge County is nec-
essary to indicate a legal domicile. A
student must show an intention to
make the city or county a perman-
ent home in order to register in the
respective area. For instance, the 12
month rental of an apartment in
Lexington does not, in itself, satisfy
the requirements, stated Mrs. Eva
Moore, the general registrar for the
City of Lexington.

mining the validity of residency

72 Convention Scheduled

In Doremus

Planning has been under way this
summer to prepare for the 1972
Mock political Convention, which
will be the 15th version of one of
WA&L's most famous traditions. In
the advance enactments of the out
of-power party's Presidential nomi
nating procedure, the students have
been correct all but four times since
1908 in predicting the outcome.

Next May's activities will com
mence with the traditional gala par-
ade through the streets of Lexing
ton to the “convention center.”
Doremus Gymnasium. Nationally
known politicians will be in attend
ance,

The convention is not a reflection
of the student delegates’ own preter
ences, but rather a sober attempt to
foresee exactly what the actual party
delegates will do. Any WAL stu-
dent may assume a delegate’s roic
and each state's chairman will be
committed to directing research into
the way his real counterpart will act
during this summer's Democratic
Convention in Miami Beach

During the fall semester most of
the work will focus on the logistical
problems of hook-up telephone line:
with actual state delegations, with
setting up platforms, and with ac
quiring the basic financing for the
project. This effort will be directed
by the co-chairmen of the 1972
Mock Convention; Mike Campilon

Fairfax County, Virginia, and Tom

Faculty Additions And

Promotions Announced

Eleven new appointments were
made to the faculty during the sum-
mer months, in addition to promo-
tions announced for nine professors
already members of the W&L fac-
ulty, Nine of the new members will
teach in the College of Arts and Sci-
ences; one, in the School of Com-
merce, Economics, and Politics; and
one more, in the School of Law.

Named to be full professors were
James Boatwright of the English de-
partment, editor of W&L’s literary
journal, “Shenandoah,” and also Dr.
Gerard M. Doyon, head of the art
department.

Promoted from assistant professor
to associate professor were Charles
B. Brockman of romance languages,
Drs. David Gordon Elmes of psy-
chology and Frederic L. Schwab of
the geology department, and Joseph
E. Ulrich of the law school.

Newly promoted assistant profes-
sors are Dr, Harold C. Hill of the

German department, [-Hsiung Ju,
artist-in-residence and art faculty
member, and William J. Stearns,

swimming coach and assistant track
coach in the physical education de-
partment.

Returning to W&L in the College
division will be Dr. Leonard E. Jar-
rard as professor of psychology.
Formerly chairman of the graduate
psychology program at Carnegie-
Mellon University, Dr. Gerrard has
received a grant from the National
Science Foundation of $20,000 to

claims is a personal statement by
the applicant that he intends to re-
main in Lexington for an indefinite
period. This intention may be sub-
stantiated by indicating that one pays
local automobile taxes, has a job in
the area, or has made a declaration
of personal property to the com-
missioner of revenue. However, the
intent of the student is the crucial
factor.

The News-Gazette also reported
that Mrs. Dan Tetlow, the former
general registrar for Lexington,
thought that some students “Have
falsely claimed an intention to re
main in Lexington after graduation.”

Saturday, October 2, is the last
day one can register for the Novem-
ber general elections.

:

support new research into motiva-
tion and behavior.

Dr. Jarrard taught at W&L from
1959, when he received the Ph.D.
degree from Carnegie-Mellon, until
1966. Under his direction, the W&L
project will focus on the relationship
between the hippocampus—a_ seg-
ment of the brain—and motivational
actions, for instance; hunger, thirst,
and exploratory activity. Dr. Jar-
rard will assume head of the depart-
ment in 1972, when Dr. William H.
Hinton, the current chairman,
reaches the mandatory retirement
age for department heads,

Other appointments: Named as-
sistant professor of biology was Dr.
Faith Harriet Gray, formerly a re-
search associate at Ohio State Uni-
versity. A 1968 Ph.D. graduate of
Ohio State, Dr. Gray has taught
part-time at Mount Holyoke and
Ohio State in addition to her re-
search activity, and from 1968 until
1970 held a post-doctoral appoint-
ment at the University of Miami
(Florida).

Dr. Charles W. Hickox, who re-
ceived the Ph.D. degree in geology
from Rice University last spring,
will join the faculty for one year as
assistant professor of geology, re-
placing Dr. Frederic Schwab, who is
spending this year in the British
Isles under a National Science
Foundation grant. Dr. Hickox was a
teaching assistant at Middlebury
College, the University of Arkansas,
and Rice.

Named instructors in the College
were Edward D. Craun and Phillip
M. Keith, both in the English De-
partment; Scott B. Cummings, socio-
logy; J. David Lazor, geology, Barry
F. Machado, history, and William
L. Sessions, philosophy.

Craun, a B.A. graduate of Wheat-
on College, is a Ph.D. candidate in
English at Princeton. Keith is for-
merly an instructor in English at
Swarthmore College, and holds the
A.B. degree from Amherst College
and the M.A, from Bryn Mawr.

B.A. graduate of the University of
Maine and earned his M.A. degree
from San Jose State College.

Lazor, a graduate of Wooster Col-
lege and Indiana University, will re-
place Dr. Edgar Spencer, head of
the geology department, who will be
on leave this year under a Sloan
grant.

History instructor Machado ex-
pects to receive his Ph.D. from
Northwestern University, where he
received the M.A. in 1969. He also
holds a B. A. degree from Dart-
mouth,

Sessions will hold a one-year ap-
pointment at W&L while Dr. Har-
rison J. Pemberton, head of the
philosophy department, is on leave
under a Ford Foundation grant. Ses-
sions is a Ph.D. candidate at Yale,
and holds the B.A. from the Univer-
sity of Colorado and the M.A, from
Union Theological Seminary.

Dean Atwood announced that
James S. Wafler, a Ph.D. candidate
at the University of Minnesota, will
join the W&L faculty for one year
as instructor, replacing Dr. William
Buchanan, head of the department,
who will be on leave in Ireland un-
der a National Science Foundation
grant. Wafler received his B.A. de-
gree cum laude from St. Olaf Col-
lege and the M.A, from Minnesota.
For the past year he has held a
management internship with the En-
vironmental Science Services Ad-
ministration and has taught at Minn-
esota and at the National Science
Foundation’s quantitative methods
institute for political scientists.

In the School of Law Dean Stein-
heimer announced the appointment
of James Bond, formerly at the Uni-
versity of Virginia, to be assistant
professor of law. Bond is a B.A.
graduate of Wabash College and
received the LL.B. degree from Har-
vard University and the LL.M. at
Virginia. He has served as instructor
in the international and comparative
law division of the Judge Advocate
General's School in Charlottesville
and has worked on an Army-wide
project to rewrite the law of war.

brought limited co-education to
Washington and Lee. This year a
total of 23 women from other Vir-
ginia colleges, will attend the Uni-
versity, including 15 from Hollins,
2 from Sweet Briar, 5 from Mary
Baldwin, and | from Randolph Ma-
con Woman's College.

The opportunities the program of-
fers to Washington and Lee students
to study at one of the other seven
colleges (Davidson, Hampden-Syd-
ney, Hollins, Mary Baldwin, Ran-
dolph-Macon, Randolph-Macon Wo-
man's and Sweet Briar) have been
for the most part overlooked. Ap-
plications are now being accepted
for next year’s program, and the
first deadline for application is Octo-
ber 10. The program is designed for
juniors who wish to broaden the
scope of their educational experience
and take advantage of course offer-
ings, special programs, and lines of
study not available at Washington
and Lee

According to Dean William J.
Watt, who co-ordinates the program
at Washington and Lee, the two-fold
increase of exchange students on
campus was not a universal experi
ence among the colleges involved in
the program. Also, while some
courses—notably Journalism—which
are unavailable at the other schools
have been particular atiractions, the
exchange students are enrolled in a
wide variety of courses in both un
dergraduate divisions of the Uni
This indicates that the
change in academic environment of
fered by the program is also a signi
fieant factor in the decision to ex
change. Although 23 women will
participate in the program at WAl
this vear, some of these will attend
for only one term

|OUTLOOKandREview| Road Changed :

September has returned to Lexington and (select one)
a. unavoidably
b. unfortunately
c. big deal
d. sadly
e. all of the above
with this issue in your hands the Ring-tum Phi has likewise
reappeared on the Washington and Lee University scene.

Hopefully, you will continue to be an ardent subscriber and
reader long after September has passed. As a brief enticement
to you ladies and gentlemen who are stil unconvinced, here
is a synopsis of what to anticipate. With the aid of an eager
staff the spectrum of life in lovely Lexington will be un-
folded right before your eyes. Our joint effort will be to in-
form you, entertain you, motivate you, humor you and maybe
irritate you.

Another object this year will be to tell you not only what is
transpiring on “the Hill” but beyond. Simultaneously, our
staff will strive to inform you why things are happening here
and perhaps more significantly, why not.

Your academic year 1971-1972 will span a series of exciting

goings-on. More specifically, we refer to: the opening of ex- ,

panded Doremus Gymnasium (not to overlook the U.Va.
basketball game or the NCAA small college swimming cham-
pionships), the Mock Convention, Contact '72, rush, the ap-
pearance of over 20 somewhat shapely coeds, and possible the
reincarnation of the Fancy Dress Ball.

That ought to be a sufficient introduction and forewarning.
Turning to more vital matters, each of you is surely eager to
learn what has been taking place in Lexington duling your
summer vacations, The answer shall be brief since, as you
might expect, very little has changed. In the short amount of
space left in this 4x12 inche column of type we will attempt to
capsulize the traumatic events of the summer.

Most obvious of all the driveway in front of the Freshman
Dormitories is no more. Yet wait, it has only been remodeled
along with the parking lots nearby. Consequently, the 180 de-
gree hairpin turn on Washington Street has been removed.
Another proud W&L tradition bites the dust.

Probably, the largest gathering of W&L men during the
summer occurred at Indiantown Gap Military Reservation.
You may wonder what the occasion was? Junior ROTC cadets
were attending summer camp. The whole thing was worthy of
visitations by Deans Wiliam Schildt and Lewis John, and
not much else.

The Co-op remained the nerve center of the campus
throughout the summer months despite its abbreviated hours
of operation. Sadly, prices suffered a considerable boost. The
only nickel cup of coffee, served exclusively in our Co-op,
jumped to the all time high price of a dime. Even President
Nixon's wage-price freeze cannot save the death of one of
Washington and Lee’s finest traditions.

Lee Chapel was painted. Undoubtedly, that is a tradition
that has been a long time in appearing.

“Virginia is for lovers” buttons popped out across the
campus. Supposedly, Bob Keefe acquired a large cache and dis-
tributed the buttons to staff, faculty and students alike. That
could be the genesis of an outstanding new tradition.

You are certainly up to date by now, It must seem apparent
that not a great deal occurred during your absence. We hope
that the next year will be more eventful and notable. None-
theless, the “Phi” will be there every Wednesday, so why
not read it? Even if you do not savor what it says, it serves
nicely as a fishwrapper. Amen. j.W.R.

The maze of concrete, mud, and
new pavement at the entrance to
the campus between Doremus Gym-
nasium and the old Freshman Dor-
mitory is the beginning of a major
re-designing of Washington and
Lee’s road and parking system,

The first phase, being undertaken
at a cost of more than $100,000 is
scheduled for completion in Octo-
ber.

A new entrance road alongside
the new Doremus Gymnasium addi-
tion, running between Washington
Street and the existing roadway be-
hind McCormick Library has been
completed just in time for the influx
of students. The old entrance road
required cars travelling east on
Washington Street to make almost a
180-degree turn to enter the campus,
but it has been eliminated alto-
gether.

ed for the second phase of the pro-
ject which will be undertaken some-
time after the new gym addition is
completed, and will be finished next
summer, Included in this phase is a
complete revision of the parking and
roadway scheme on the southern
part of the rear campus. New walk-
ways will also be incorporated in
the plan, leading from the parking
lots below and to the west of Dore-
mus Gym. Parking will be eliminat-
ed in the triangular area in front of
the gym, replaced by a series of
walkways.

Overall the project is intended to
enhance the beauty of the part of
the campus most often used, by
creating a park-like atmosphere,

while at the same time making ac-
cess less difficult from Washington
Street. A long range goal is to elimi-
nate the intrusion of as many ve-
hicles as possible into the middle of
the campus.

Freshman Class

Washington and Lee welcomed
the class of 1975 last Tuesday with
a barrage of placement tests, con-
ferences, and speeches. The 353 man
class is smaller than last year’s rec-
ord total of 383. The freshmen are
drawn from 36 states and one for-
eign country, with Virginia, Texas,
and Pennsylvania claiming the larg-
est representation.

Also arriving in scenic Lexington
were 23 girls from Hollins, Sweet
Briar, Mary Baldwin and Randolph-
Macon Womans College. They will
attend W&L as exchange students
under a program begun a year ago.

Letters To The Editor

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

As a freshman, | felt as if I had
been pushed into going to school.
Washington and Lee University was
my choice, whether or not I would
go to college was not. | went with-
out question. This can create a prob-
lem when one attends college for
awhile only to realize after a cer-
tain length of time that he is at-
tending with no conception of a pur-
pose.

I believe that if | had some defin-
ite reason for attending college plac-
ed before my mind, | might have un-
derstood this university sooner, thus
taking advantage of the preliminary
months of my freshman year. I
imagine there are some if not many
freshman and some upperclassmen
whose thoughts revolve around the
questions: Why am I here? What is
the purpose of the university?

In the hope this will be of indi-
vidual benefit to others, | would like
to put forth the suggestions of others
which might be of help in answering
these very basic questions.

As a start, | would like to print
the bulk of a letter written by Rob-
ert E. Lee on January 17, 1867 for
the benefit of parents who need “to
consider the fundamental principles
to be observed in the education of
their children.”

“In its broad, comprehensive sense
education embraces the physical,
moral and intellectual instruction of
a child from infancy to manhood.
Any sysiem is imperfect which does

 

not combine them all and that is
best which while it thoroughly deve-
lops them, abuses the coarse animal
emotions of human nature and
exalts the higher faculties and feel-
ings. A child has everything to learn
and is more readily taught by having
before it good examples to imitate
than by simple precepts. He should
therefore as far as circumstances
will permit, be encouraged to associ-
ate with his parents, for heart must
be affected, his feelings moved as
well as his mind expanded. He may
be taught that it is criminal to steal
and sinful to lie, yet be unable to
apply this knowledge to the govern-
ment of himself and it will therefore
be of no value to him unless the
principle is confirmed into a habit.
Obedience is the first requisite in
family training. It should be made
sincere and perfect and to proceed
as much from affection as a convic-
tion of its necessity. To accomplish
this great prudence and the exercise
of much patience are necessary. By
firmness mixed with kindness, ihe
child by repeated experience will
learn that he is not to follow his
first impulse and that self control,
which even an infant can understand
is necessary to his comfort, Neither
violence or harshness should ever
be used and the parent must bear
constantly in mind that to govern his
child he must show him that he can
control himself. One of the most
common errors in the management
of children is irregularity of behav-

= ; *

 

ior towards them. They are as skill-
ful as pertinacious in their attempts
to gratify their self will; at one time
trying to evade authority, at another
to oppose it. If they once succeed
they are encouraged to perseverse
and it is necessary for the parent to
meet the first attempt with firmness
and not permit himself to be baffled
either by evasion or resistance. Al-
though a child may not yield to
threats and may defy punishment he

Profile Given

Although it is still early to judge
the new arrivals—both male and fe-
male—their academic statistics show
them to compare favorably with
previous classes, said an Administra-
tion spokesman. Almost 200 of
them graduated in the top one-fifth
of their senior class, so they should
be prepared for the rigors of cam
pus life.

Long-time observers of the fresh-
man scene have grimly noted that
this class has followed the current
dress trend, and all but abandoned
the coat-and-tie tradition. Even the
early fraternity rush functions, once
a hot-bed of traditional dress, saw
the freshmen wearing everything
from tank shirts to jungle fatigues.

This does not infer that the class
of ‘75 contains the seeds of anarchy.
Rather, that they are following a
national trend away from such ma-
terial manifestations. Dean William
Schildt, chief coordinator for the
freshmen noted that this class con
tained a “wide diversity of interests
and talents,” with a “higher profile
of independence and individualism.

Mothers, do not despair. General
Lee's college still has more tradition
behind it than the Daughters of the
Confederacy. While _ their
might not match Brooks Brothers
standards, their inquisitive nature
has already made a positive impres-
sion on campus.

Upsets; Frisco; Worster

BY BOB “LASH” LARUE

Some reflections while wondering
what kind of season Washington and
Lee’s football team will have... .
it's looking to be that kind of
screwy year that one runs into every
once in a while. Southern Cal and
LSU, highly regarded favorites
among sports writers, both bit the
dust over the weekend .... The
Trojans, ranked by Sports Hlustrat-
ed as the nation’s third best grid
team, was the first 1971 victim of
that magazine’s infamous “jinx”,
falling prey to Alabama 17-10....
And speaking of topsy-turvy, who
would have thought that San Fran-
cisco would stay out front so long?
Granted the Giants aren't in the
playoffs yet, but then, few felt the
team would make it any higher than
second with a strong wind... . I
still like Frisco’s chance as the West-
ern Division winners, although Pitts-
burgh’s fantastic Pirates will be the
National League’s representative for
1971's October Classic. . . . Former
University of Texas star Steve Wor-
ster’s run-in with Canadian authori-
ties added some substance to the
widely held rumor that something
grassy was going on last New Year's

Rebuilding Gridders
Face Tough Schedule

BY LEWIS HIXSON AND
PALMER TRICE

When students begin their annual
trek out to Wilson Field to watch
the first home football game, there
will be no surprises. “We will be
underdogs in every game,” Head
Coach Buck Leslie emphasized in a
preseason interview.

Coming off a dismal 2-7 season,
the Generals are once again facing
“a rebuilding year.” Last year the
Generals fashioned an exciting pass-
ing attack. It featured sophomore
Steve Fluharty at the helm, throw-
ing to Bruce Green and Steve Ma-
haffey. Steve Mahaffey ended up
leading the country in receptions
yast year, grabbing 74 catches for
897 yards. With their (Green and
Mahaffey) departure, the coaching
staff has two key question marks to
answer, Passing was the gridders’
game plan last year, and this year it

will probably be a replay. To fill the
gaps, Coach Leslie is turning to a
new group of receivers. Fighting for
the flanker spot are Mark Lane, Bob
Hessler, and Rich Romanelli. Chap-
py Conrad and Bill Baldwin have
looked good at the end spots. These
guys could be the key to the W&L
season.

“Three yards and a cloud of dust”
will not be the cry bursting from
Wilson Field, Instead of the “Seven
Blocks of Granite”, the Blue offen-
sive line will take a different tack.
This is, to a large part, due to the
offensive line, which will average
about 185 pounds. The Generals
will rely on a moving pocket, simi-
lar to that used by Len Dawson and
the Kansas City Chiefs. When mov-
ing on the ground, the interior line-
man will depend on the use of traps
and slant blocking.

when Notre Dame crushed Texas in
the Cotton Bowl. . . . Worster con-
tributed nicely to the Irish cause
with several fumbles. . . . Whatever
side of the fence one takes, the in-
cident saddened more than a few.
... If I had three wishes to make
for this baseball season, I would
hope that Vida Blue would win
thirty games, that Willie Stargell hit
fifty home runs, and that the two
could meet up in the World Series.
. . . Wishes one and two look dis-
tant, but the third is a distinct pos-
sibility. . . . For those of you who
have been asking where soccer and
baseball coach Joe Lyles is, word
has it that he has been involved in
the Miss America pageant. .. .
While everyone agrees that the new
addition to Doremus Gym is super-
spectacular, a number of people,
myself included, are wondering what
are the chances for repair on the
locker room showers beneath the
stadium. . . . As any, football, base-

 

ball, lacrosse, or track man_ will
testify, the facilities are pretty poor;
nozzles spit only a tiny spray and
drains back up, creating a horrible
mess. The situation is embarrassing
when other schools use the showers,

with Notre Dame and Nebraska as
this year’s Number One college
team. Make my choice Notre Dame;
somebody from the Big Eight will
knockoff the Cornhuskers . . . and

pened to Tom Dimitroff?

AD Bill McHenry Ponders Gym, CAC

QUESTION: What are some of
your reasons and feelings about
coming back as athletic director
after having played here as an ath-
lete?

McHENRY: Well, I can tell you
this it is a great thrill to be return-
ing to W&L. I had four very happy
years here in the early 1950's under
a different type of program and I
enjoyed my association with Wash-
ington and Lee, I have tried to keep
my friendships over the years with
the people that | knew here but of
course as you get away from a
school you make new friends and
new associations. It has been a great
thrill to come back and the recep-
tion that we have had has just been
tremendous, | am _ really looking
forward to many happy years in
Lexington and at W&L.

QUESTION: We would like you
to comment on scheduling, especi-
ally since our football team plays
such powers as Bucknell and Coast
Guard this season, both of which
appear out of our league.

McHENRY: Well number one,
the scheduling was done before |
came here. Football scheduling is
done 4 or 5 years in advance, | will
be handling the football scheduling
in the future along with our football
coach Buck Leslie and I will cer-
tainly follow any recommendation
that he makes. | agree Bucknell may
be out of our class, but I do not feel
Coast Guard is out of our class.
When I was at Lebanon Valley for
the past two years, we played Coast
Guard, As a matter of fact W&L
fills our spot. We beat them 21-7
two years ago and last year we
lost 27-21. Two real fine games, and
I certainly feel that W&L will have
an excellent chance in this ball
game and | don’t think they are out
of our class at all.

Bucknell is a different story. They
are big time in football, relatively
speaking. It is a fine school, and of
course the type of school you would
like to be associated with, but not
compatible with our football pro-
gram. | am sure our kids will do a
real fine job and I think in general

our football schedule is a very chal-
lenging one this year. But I think
from what I have been able to ob-
serve so far, with the outstanding
spirit and attitude that the kids have
shown I am confident that they are
going to be in there in every ball
game. I have the greatest confidence
in the program that we are running
here. As far as our scheduling is
concerned, we don’t have conference
scheduling to be concerned with.

eee

 

Each individual coach handles his
own scheduling with my approval. I
have asked the coaches to do this
immediately following the season. |
want to be involved with the sche-
duling, yet | want the coaches to
have the right to pick and choose
the teams that they want to play
wherever possible.

QUESTION: What kind of tour-
naments, CAC tournaments, cham-
pionships or any other kind of
sporting events are to be held in
the new gym?

McHENRY: Well, first of all, in
the new gym we are hoping that
everything will be completed and |
am confident that everything will be

completed before December | when
we open our season with UVA here
which will be an outstanding event.
Immediately following that we have
the W&L Invitational Basketball

Tournament on the 3rd and 4th of
December and the last week in Feb-
ruary our CAC Basketball Cham-
pionships will be held here. This
year unfortunately the CAC will be
down to four teams in basketball.
Washington University has dropped

 

Pi

oe

“Pm convinced that the program we are operating now is the only type of

out of the basketball league and
they have been placed on probation
and have been given one year to get
back in order on this. We are hope-
ful that they will come back into it
the next year. If not they will be
dropped from the conference. We
also have the NCAA college divi-
sion swimming championships here
in March.

QUESTION: You just happened
to mention Washington University.
What do you think is the future of
the CAC? What if Washington
doesn't get together and come back
in. Do you think the CAC will just
stay with four teams? Do you
think any other schools will drop
out because of budgetary matters?

McHENRY: Well this is a diffi-
cult question for me to answer right
now. | have been involved in one
CAC meeting which was held last
May and I was very disappointed at
that time to learn that Washington
University had dropped basketball
and that Southwestern University
had dropped swimming from their
programs. There has been a great
deal of talk about further expansion
in the CAC and I personally believe
that something has to be done in
order to have the conference sur-
vive. | don't think we can go along
with 4 teams or 3 teams in some of
the areas and I would like to hope
that we could bring in and attract
some schools that have similar phil-
osophies and programs that we are
trying to have at our schools and
perhaps add some schools to the
conference. The biggest problem as
far as | am concerned with our con-
ference right now is with the travel.
In addition we don't seem to have
the natural rivalry with some of
these schools that are so far remov-
ed from Washington and Lee, There
of course is the possibility that we
may eventually venture into some
other type of conference arrange-
ments, This is very premature and
nothing has been done so far.

QUESTION: What do you think
about the intercollegiate sports here?
Do you think that they will decline
or that they are declining in favor
of intramurals considering the num-
ber of freshmen that come out for
the different sports?

McHENRY;: I don't think so at
all. I think that we are in an age
where there is a lack of participation
in some areas and yet I don't think

it has affected our athletic program
here. When you look at the number
of people that we have out for foot-
ball, right now we are well over 70.
and we have a good nucleus of
freshmen that are out. Also, we
have a good nucleus of freshmen
that are out for soccer, I think that
the participation at Washington and
Lee in our athletic program is excel-
lent. I just talked to a close friend
of mine who used to coach here and

athletics for this type of institution.
I think in the next 10 or 20 years
we are going to see a polarization of
schools that are going to have major
programs but this will be a very,
very small number of schools. I also
think that many of the schools are
going to have to follow the same
policy and philosophy that Washing-
ton and Lee adopted some 16 or 17
years ago.

QUESTION: | can think of some

 

program a school of W&L’s size and basic philosophy can operate under.”

who is now the athletic director and
football coach at Haverford College.
They are having some severe prob-
lems. And we noticed some changes
and participation in the last few
years when | was in Lebanon Valley
College but | think Washington and
Lee is in a very healthy situation
We want a good strong sound intra-
mural program. I think Coach
Verne Canfield is doing an excellent
job with our intramural program.

QUESTION: What do you think
some of our advantages are of stay-
ing in the CAC? Are there any?

McHENRY: One of the advant-
ages of course is that we are cur-
rently associating with some fine
colleges and universities that have
similar philosophies to Washington
and Lee University. I think there is
always an advantage to associate
yourself with other people and other
universities that have the same basic
philosophy. | would say this is the
basic advantage right now. The
greatest disadvantage that I mention-
ad before is the travel factor and
the lack of real rivalry here. We are
not a scheduling conference. Except
in football, we do not play the other
schools in regular schedules at the
present time. We are just a cham-
pionship conference.

QUESTION: How do you feel
about scholarships? I understand
that you were here at school when
we were carrying on the scholarship
program and you have seen it from
both sides. What do you think?

McHENRY: Well I'm convinced
that the program that we are oper-
ating right now is the only type of
program that a school of Washing-
ton and Lee’s size and basic philoso-
phy can operate under. | grew up
under the old system for I was here

enjoyed it very much and I must ad-
mit that at the time the decision was
made to change that I felt, as so
many other alumni, that it was a
poor decision, Now | am convinced
more than ever that what we have
done has been the right philosophy
to follow. | have coached now for
the past 16 years under a non-sub-
sidized program where the philoso-
phy is similar to what we have here
and I am convinced that this is the

examples of schools who are smaller
than we, such as Davidson and |
think VMI is at least keeping its
head above water. How is it com-
parable to continue such a program,
and I point to Davidson especially
where they have been in the top ten
in basketball. How can they accom-
plish this where as you don’t think
we can?

McHENRY: Well | think in the
cases that you cited, both Davidson
and VMI have had some fantastic
problems in the last few years.
Davidson is, currently, as | under-
stand it undergoing some real
changes in their thinking in the type

of program that they are involved
in. They have had a severe cut back
in their football program for ex-
ample. In basketball apparently they
are still trying to maintain the image
that they set a few years ago. VMI
certainly has had great difficulty
with their program, they have main-
tained a major college program but
| read the other day where they
have had the poorest won and loss
record of any college in the United
States in their three major sports—
football, basketball and baseball. I
would not be inclined to say that
they are keeping their head above
water. I have the greatest admiration
for their coaching staff and in what
they are trying to do but I think
they are swimming up-tide right
now.

QUESTION: How is the W&L re-
cruiting effort? | know that this
time last year we talked to Athletic
Director Corrigan and he said that
WAL is really going to have to try
to get the alumni and students and
the coaches and everybody out to
help with the recruiting. Have you
found that you are getting the kind
of athletes to build a successful pio-
gram?

McHENRY: Well we are it some
areas, in other areas we need to im-
prove upon our recruiting efforts
Certainly with the success that our
basketball team has enjoyed in the
last few years—they won 4 out of
the last 5 CAC championships and
they have had very fine seasons. |
think Coach Canfield has done an
outstanding job of recruiting. Coach
Szlasa has done an outstanding job
of recruitment of lacrosse players
and in the latest ratings that just
came out a couple of weeks ago we
are seventh in the nation and rated
the finest small college lacrosse
team in the country. We hope to
have the same type of success in all
of our sports and in order to achieve
this we must get help from our stu-
dent body an dour alumni. You stu-
dents are in the best position to sell
your friends from your hometowns

Rebuilding Year

(Continued from page 4)

In the backfield, behind Fluharty,
will be senior co-captain JoJo Mar-
tin. “JoJo is a tough competitor, and
has looked good in practice,” Leslie
commented. For once, the coaching
staff thinks that it will have good
depth in the offensive backfield.
Sophomore Lewis Powell is the
number two quarterback. He lacks
experience, but is capable of running
the ball club, Both quarterbacks will
have difficulty developing a ground
game, and the rush will primarily
be used to keep the defenses honest,
and as a diversion.

Coach Leslie called this the tough-
est schedule that has been played by
his program. It is certainly the
toughest in recent memory. New
this year are Bucknell and the Coast
Guard Academy. Returning from
last years grind are Hampden-Syd-
ney, Towson State, and Western
Maryland.

“We haven't scheduled a win,”
grinned Coach Leslie. That is an un-
derstatement. General fans should
see some excellent football teams
this fall. Defensively, the Blue must
improve, They gave up 250 points in
nine games last season. Returning to
anchor this year’s version will be co-
captain Dave Brooks, Marshall
Washburn, and Tim Haley. Several
of the quicker freshmen have switch-
ed to the defense. The coaching staff
promises an improvement, If it
comes, the Generals could have a
real competitor.

With the return of Fluharty and
The Bomb, the W&L gridders will
definitely be an exciting team to
watch. There will be a lot of ques-
tion marks to fill, and with a few
timely breaks, the Generals could be
an outstanding team.

As a unique educational enter-
prise W&L’s Mock Convention has
traditionally allowed students an in-

by the real delegates themselves. In
addition, this year’s convention will
serve a second purpose—as Campi-
longo explained, “Because of re-
forms that have taken place in the
last few years, we will have an un-
usual opportunity to test the efficacy
of those changes prior to Miami. In
effect, the 1972 Mock Convention at

Chambers Brothers,

(Continued from page 1)

Senior Bert Meem, President of
the Dance Board, has already an-
nounced the visiting artists for two
concerts this fall. On October 23,
the Chambers Brothers will high-
light Homecomings weekend. On
November 20, Canadian folk star
Gordon Lightfoot will appear in
concert.

A highlight of winter Dance
Board activities may well be the re-
vival of Washington and Lee's tra-
ditional Fancy Dress weekend,
which may feature 5 to 8 hour con-
cert-dance. Among those being con-
sidered for a Fancy Dress appear-
ance are Littke Richard, Chuck
Berry, and Bo Diddley.

The Board is also considering ne-
gotiations with Rod Stewart, Leon
Russell, Rita Coolidge and The
Grateful Dead for possible appear-
ances later in the year.

Meem is hopeful of adding extra
events to the regularly scheduled
five concerts. He urges students to
purchase dance plans, to aid not
only in obtaining the best possible
talent for the regular shows but also
in providing possible additional per-
formances.

play “Luther” will be held at the R.
E. Lee Episcopal Church on Friday
evening, September 17.

The drama depicts the life of the
man whose spiritual struggles led
him to split Christendom apart and
arouse some of the most bitter pas-
sions and bloody wars in the history
of Western civilization. The play-
wright, John Osborne, shook the
British and American stage in the
mid-1950's with his drama, “Look
Back in Anger.”

Though “Luther” chronicles the
story of a famous leader of the Re-
formation, it is not regarded as a re-
ligious play to draw or repel one
denomination or another; rather, it
is a human drama of insight and
fiery emotional power.

Though Martin Luther did man-
age to provoke bitter controversy,
not to mention 200 years of religious
wars, Osborne's play about him
drew no particular controversy in
its original Londen and New York
runs, Audiences of all faiths regard-
ed it not as religious history, nor
even as pure biography, but rather
as a sweeping drama of size and
power about the most profound
human feelings

The New York drama critics be
stowed on “Luther” their annual
Critic's Circle Award as the best
play of the 1963.1964 season

The performance of “Luther” will
begin at 7:30 p.m. on Friday, Sep
tember 17. Tickets for the play are
$1 and may be obtained from the
office of the R, E. Lee Church dur
ing the hours of 9 to 4 tomorrow or
Friday of at the door on the even
ing of performance

Letters To The Editor .. .

 

 

(Continued from page 2)

cannot resist patient kindness and
gentle admonition.

The love of truth is equal in im-
portance to habitual obedience.
Every encouragement, even to the
pardoning of offenses, should be giv-
en to its cultivation. Children are
naturally truthful and they should
be accustomed to hear the truth al-
ways spoken; and candour, integrity
and confession of error, with a de-
testation of falsehood, dishonesty
and equivocation should be sedul-
ously inculcated. A strict adherence
to promises made to them is of the
utmost importance, as well as the
removal of all temptation to mis-
conduct. They should also be pre-
pared and warned against its attacks.

Sentiments of religion should be
early impressed upon the minds of
children by personal explanation
and systematic instruction. As the
intellect expands its sacred truths
will be comprehended and felt and
its motives and principles be stren-
gthened and confirmed by practice
and habit. An essential part of the
education of youth is to teach them
to serve themselves and to impress
upon them the fact that nothing
good can be acquired in this world
without labour; and that the very
necessaries and comforts of life must
be pursued by earnest and regular
exertion. They should also be taughi
to know that after having been rear-
ed and educated by their parents,

they should not expect them to fur-
ther provide for them; and that
their future subsistence and advance-
ment must depend upon themselves.
Parents sometimes commit the mis-
take of allowing their children after
having reached the period of life
when they ought to be engaged in
making a livelihood, to rely upon
them for support. This encourages
them in injurious idleness and de-
stroys that spirit of self dependence
which is necessary for their advance-
ment in life and causes them to ap-
pear so unreasonable as to depend
upon them, after having arrived at
the age of being able to think and
act for themselves,

The choice of a profession is not
of so much consequence as the man-
ner in which it is pursued, If habits
of self control and self denial have
been acquired during education the
great object has been accomplished,
Diligence and integrity in any useful
pursuit of life will be sure to secure
prosperity and fame and success will
result from engaging in that business
in which the generality of mankind
are interested,”

Copies of this letter can be ac-
quired in the museum below Lee
Chapel. Any other suggestions on
the purposes of education will be
welcome,

S. Robinson:
Honor Code

BY STEVE ROBINSON

By now, you have heard quite a
bit about the Honor System. Much
of what you have heard has prob-
ably confused you and might even
have caused doubts to arise in your
mind as to the system’s aims. All
that could be definitely attributed to
the Honor System was the phrase:
“A Washington and Lee student is
to conduct himself as a gentleman
in matters of honor at all times; he
is trusted, and he assumes the obli-
gation to be trustworthy.”

What does this new statement
mean? Has the Honor System been
changed? Is it no longer a breach of
the Honor Code to lie, cheat, or
steal?

 

Due to the current widespread con-
cern over the Honor System at
W&L, the Ring-tum Phi has decided
to reprint the remarks made by Stu-
dent Body President Steve Robinson
at the Opening Assembly, The text
appears here in full.—Ed.

 

To find the answers to these ques-
tions, one must delve into the his-
tory of the Honor System. The
Honor system at W&L was an un-
written rule for over a century. The
South had long espoused a concept
of gentlemanly conduct which in-
cluded honesty, So in 1867 when
Robert E. Lee, then President of
Washington College, told his stu-
dents, “we have but one rule here,
and that is that you be a gentleman,”
it was nothing more than the first
crystallization of the Washington
and Lee concept of honor.

It was in this form that the W&L
Honor System existed for over 75
years. Not until after World War Il
did the phrase “lie, cheat, or steal”
become associated with the Honor
System.

There has always been a question-
ing of the Honor System, but in-
quiry into the idea of “lie, cheat,
and steal” increased markedly in the
past few years. The Honor System
works because the students have
faith in it, not because the Execu-
tive Committee enforces it. There-
fore, if the students at W&L no
longer thought that “lie, cheat or
steal” embodied the spirit of the
Honor System, the terminology of
the Honor code had to be reviewed,
and a change was made.

There is another reason for the
change in wording; the simple
phrase, “A Washington and Lee stu-
dent will not lie, cheat, or steal” is
very definite and does not encom-
pass the thought processes used by
the members of the Executive Com-
mittee during an honor violation, A
major consideration in all hearings
is the intent of the individual in-
volved.

Due to these reasons, in the spring
of 1971 a change was made in the
written statement about the Honor
System. There were two choices (1)
A codified detailed statement listing
every type of a possible violation,
and (2) an alternative to this, a gen
eralized statement similar to the
one made by General Lee over a
century ago, The reasons for choos-
ing the latter course seem fairly ob-
vious,

This new statement does not
change the meaning of the Honor
System at all,

It is not a retreat from the
foundations of honor at WAL, On
the contrary, the new phrase allows
for more flexibility and interpreta
‘ion by both the EC and the other
members of WAL’s student body

Washington and Lee is a com
munity of trust, and by your pres
ence here you have become a part
of that community, The advantages
are many, You can go to classes
leaving your door open without fear
of someone coming in and taking
something, you can take exams with
out proctors, and you can schedule

our own final exams, But the big
eest benefit of the Honor System is
overlooked by many people—that of
having your word taken as the truth
by anyone in Lexington—a profes

or, another student, a merchant in
town

One cannot expect, however, to
reap the benefits of the Honor Sys
tiem without assuming the respon
ibilities required of a student who
lives under the system's jurisdiction

The first of these obligations is to
abide by the system's provisions and
io help perpetuate this way of life
And this brings us to the question
what is a dishonorable act?

Concert Series Debuts

The Washington and Lee Con-
cert Guild opens its 1971-72 season
on September 27 at 8:00 p.m. in
Lee Chapel with Diane Borgus, so-
prano soloist.

Miss Borgus, a native of Lexing-
ton, received a Bachelor of Music
Performance from the University of
Michigan. She has studied with Har-
old Haugh and received scholarships
throughout her four years at Michi-
gan, She sang in the University
Choir, and had principal roles in
“The Merry Widow” and “Manon.”
In addition, she has done solo work
at Zion Lutheran Church in Ann
Arbor.

She was also first runner-up at the
1970 Miss Michigan Pageant.

The program will be the one
which she sang at her graduation re-
cital, It will consist of Italian,
French, German and American art
songs, including a group by Robert
Schumann. She will conclude with
a group of spirituals, including one
by Stephen Foster,

Miss Borgus will be accompanied
by Mr. James T. Cook of the
Washington and Lee music staff,

This concert will be followed by
six others.

On Oct. 4, the Guild will present
Bernard and Naomi Zaslav, a viola

and piano duo. The Zaslov duo was
started in 1948 and has been most
active since 1961, They have per-
formed at Carnegie Hall, La Mai-
son Francais of New York Uni-
versity and Columbia University,
among others.

In addition to the established rep-
etoire they have actively promoted
new works written for them by
American composers,

Huntle

President Robert E. R. Huntley
warned Washington and Lee stu-
dents to guard against the loss of the
“community of spirit” and “esteem
for one another” that characterizes
the W&L experience. He spoke on
the occasion of the University’s tra-
ditional Opening Assembly conduct
ed last Wednesday at noon in Evans
Dining Hall.

Huntley, after welcoming the stu-
denis back to Lexington, related in
inimatable fashion some of his own
recreational activities of the past
three months—the fishing, hunting.
and summer planning. His summer
reflections led to the observation

Is Keynote Speaker

One of the South's most promi-
nent “new” Democrats, Governor
Jimmy Carter of Georgia, will de-
liver the keynote address next spring
at W&L’s 15th mock political con-
vention.

Carter, who previously held of-
fice in the Georgia State legislature,
was catapulted to the governorship
after upsetting former Governor
Carl Sanders in the primary contest
and proceeding to defeat the Repub-
lican candidate in last November's
general election. He achieved na-
tional political prominence by de-
claring in his inaugural address: “I
say to you quite frankly that the
time for racial discrimination is over.
Our people have already made this
major and difficult decision.”

Carter’s speech will follow the tra-
ditional kickoff parade through
downtown Lexington May 5, ac-
cording to the announcement issued
this week by the student chairmen
of the convention, Tom Gillespie
and Mike Campilongo.

As keynoter for the mock Presi-
dential convention proceedings, Car-
ter follows the footsteps of former
President Harry S. Truman, who de-
livered the address in 1960; former
Vice-President Alben Barkley, 1956;
former Rep. Walter Judd, 1964,
four years after keynoting the ac-
tual GOP convention, and Gov,
Claude Kirk of Florida, 1968.

“Previously we have usually tried
to get someone of long-standing
prominence to appear as keynoter,”
commented Campilongo. He pointed

that “new yardsticks” are needed to
measure the changes that are occur-
ing constantly at W&L and all over
the nation within colleges and uni-

versities. “Current literature warns
us that the day after tomorrow
every institution we have known

could be unrecognizable.”

Huntley remarked that much of
the innovation at W&L has been ob-
served through the rather unreliable
perspective of “the nostalgia phe-
nomenon, an affliction of WAL sup
porters perhaps to a greater degree
than most other institutions.”

“Washington and Lee has a way
of getting under your skin.” said

out that Carter exemplified the for-
ward-looking spirit of this year’s
convention, having “enunciated a
clear break with the old issues and
past politics.”

“He is particularly appropriate,”
continued Campilongo, “for the pur-
pose of this year’s Mock Convention
is not to imitate national politics in
its old forms, in the sense of looking
backward—but our aim is to look
ahead to anticipate the changes and
reforms which will come about in
party politics over the next four to
eight years.”

“If we were just to put on a two-
day carnival, we might as well not
have it,” Campilongo emphasized.

Carter was recently featured in a
recent issue of TIME, which explor-
ed the “new breed” of progressive
Democratic governors who were
swept into office in 1971, including
Askew of Florida, Bumpers of Ar-
kansas, and West of South Caro-
lina. “We all ran against the estab-
lishment,” Carter stated during a
recent forum in Atlanta, and most
of these contests were rated as up-
sets by political observers.

Born in Plains, Ga., where he
continues to operate his family’s cot-
ton and peanut warehouse, Carter
was graduated with distinction from
the U.S. Naval Academy, and then
served two years on battleships and
five years on submarines.

In statewide politics only since
1962, Carter made his first try for
the governorship in 1966, coming in

Huntley, and he went on to em-
phasize that the nostalgic tendency
of alumni is to remember “only the
good, tangibly indicated in customs
of dress and speaking.” “But,”
Huntley added, “the man who oc-
casionally applies his intellect to re-
call the way it really was,” may also
recognize that “a certain intangible
quality of Washington and Lee may
be drifting away.”

“A unique esteem for one another,
a self-respect, community of spirit,
gentleness, integrity . could be
lost here,” continued Huntley. The
President concluded his address by
calling on the present students of
Washington and Lee to assure “that
these intangibles will not disappear,
but that indeed they will be strength-

 

President Huntley demonstrates his fly-casting technique before audi-

third behind the winner Lester Mad-
dox. Four years later he won with
almost 60 per cent of the vote, with
Maddox elected as his Lieutenant
Governor,

Carter describes himself as a poli-
tical conservative, believing that the
“future of Georgia will be determin-
ed by leaders who believe in self-
reliance, local control, and indivi-
dual participation in government.”

Thus far the Carter administration
has witnessed its share of contro-
versy. Carter further surprised and
angered some of the old party regu-
lars with his appointment of a fel-
low “new” Democrat, David Gam-
brell, to assume the U.S. Senate seat
of the late Richard Russell. Carter
has also been in the forefront with
his programs for state governmental
reorganization and environmental
protection. All this, not to mention
the friction emanating from Lieu-
tenant Governor Maddox's office
over the control of the Georgia
Democratic party.

Nevertheless, political commenta-
tors agree that Carter will be among
the most influential Democrats at
the 1972 party convention in Miami
Beach.

In previous mock conventions,
held for the party that will challenge
the incumbent, W&L students have
been correct nine times, wrong just
four—giving them a better record at
judging the mood of the parties than
either party at judging the mood of
the voters.

ened , . . to give life and meaning to

Huntley's remarks were preceeded
by a series of introductions, recog-
nizing the new Dean of the College,
Dr. William J. Watt, and the new
Assistant Dean of the College, Dr.
Robert W. McAhren. The invocation
was offered by Dr. David W. Sprunt,
the University chaplain.

Following Huntley's address Presi-
dent of the Student Body Steve Rob-
inson called for a “mutual trust” on
the part of the students to “uphold
the heritage” of the W&L Honor
System. The teat of Mr. Robinson's

OUTLOOK and REVIEW | Jour nalism Labor ator y Press

September 22, 1971

“SECTION 1. The right of citizens of the United States,
who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be
denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on
account of age.

“SECTION 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce
this article by appropriate legislation.”

That is the Amendment XXVI to the United States Con-
stitution, What it means is that almost all W&L students
can vote in the 1972 Presidential elections. But will the mem-
bers of the newly enfranchised under-21 set take advantage
of this Amendment?

Judging from current evidence, the answer seems to be no.

For those of you who are still unfamiliar with the proce-
dure for voting, there is a simple mandatory requisite before
you are allowed to cast a ballot. You must register to vote.
That seems to be the problem—not very many W&L men (or
women) have registered. Such a feat may be accomplished in
City Hall. However, the City Registrar, Mrs. Moore, reported
Friday evening that, “only ten W&L boys have registered
and most of them have lived in Lexington all their lives. And
not a single VMI cadet has registered.”

Last week's Ring-tum Phi carried a front page article en-
titled “W&L Men Can Vote Here”. That story explained the
details about registering to vote in this city. For the sake of
brevity, the requirements of registering can be summarized
simply :

1. residence evidenced by domicile (a require-

ment fulfilled by attending the university )

2. residence evidenced by abode
The City Registrar reported that she would decide on an in-
dividual’s fulfillment of the second requirement “by some in-
tent of staying in Lexington.” In making such a decision the
following factors would weigh heavily: whether students re-
turn home over vacations, payment of personal property taxes,
and being employed in town.

Undoubtedly, most out-of-town students remain uninter-
ested in the intricacies of Lexington and Virginia political up-
heavals. Perhaps, these gentlemen, who are here for only a
four year stay, pay greater attention to hometown politics,
somewhat in the vein of remaining relatively true to a home-
town honey. This is understandable and even laudable. But for
these individuals, the absentee ballot is their voice in local
government.

Utilization of these absentee ballots is favored by Attor-
ney General John Mitchell and others, Of course a concen-
trated, well organized electorate can dominate an election.
The slate of officeholders in Berkeley, California is ample
evidence of this possibility. Thus, townspeople might argue
that students are just passing through and actually have no
stake in Lexington’s future.

To guard against such transients controlling local elections
is a personal statement that the applicant intends to remain in
Lexington for an indefinite period. That may be a pragmatic
solution for the city, but we wonder if it is equitable? When
others are trying to gain their privilege of voting, no such
statement is needed, Everybody is not asked if they will re-
main in tow for a period greater than four years.

Enough has been said about the mechanics of registering.
More needs to be said about the motives for registering. Think
back to the summer of 1968, Thousands of youths caused tur-
moil in Chicago during the Democratic National Convention,
Many of these people had a single complaint—they had no
voice in a government that was sending them off to die in
Viet Nam. The vehicle of opposition or support of this war is
now available. Many of these individuals can protest with a
more effective tool, the vote.

In early May Washington and Lee will stage the Mock
Convention. A great number of people are engrossed in the
preparation of such an undertaking. It would be a sad com-
mentary on our student body, if a proportional number of
students did not register to vote for the real thing, the 1972
elections,

The Ring-tum Phi does not especially care where you cast
your vote. There are two previously explained options; one
is voting in Lexington and the second is casting an absentee
ballot. You alone can decide that issue,

What we do care about is that many people have struggled
in our behalf to get the privilege to vote for 18 year olds. So
kindly get off your ass, go register and vote.

During a recent visit to the jour-
nalism building, I was suddenly
struck by the notion that I was tot-
ally ignorant of how our own Ring-
tum Phi, or for that matter, any
other publication here at W & L is
published. In a desperate attempt to
sate my constant quest for truth
(which is probably more a matter
of meddlesome curiosity), | found

myself talking to two gentlemen who P

remember the beginning of the pub-
lishing story at Washington and Lee.

The men: Ed Walker and Ed
Backus. Their organization:
Journalism Laboratory Press. A fi-
nancially independent,
outfit, the press was born in the
1930's with the donation of some

printing equipment from various |
larger companies. None of that ori- |

ginal equipment is still in use today.

Yet, now, some forty years later, |
though continually changing, the |

Laboratory Press functions self-suf-

The |

non-profit, |

ed to a hulking black mass of
wheels, rollers and belts. “It was
considered a good device a few years
back, and works okay for us now,
but in a very short time it will be-
come obsolete and have to be re-
placed.”

Can Reclamation

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

The Washington and Lee Ecology
Club has begun a can reclamation
project. We would like to collect
both aluminum and non-aluminum
cans from the fraternities, individual
students, cafes, and townspeople
here in Lexington. While rush is in
progress, we are just concerned with
the fraternities.

If you are a member of a frater-
nity and would like to help us in this
project, we would appreciate it if
you would have your fraternity keep
its used beer cans separate from the
garbage. We would like to collect
all of the cans, aluminum and non-
aluminum, and this cannot be done
when cans are scattered randomly
through your plastic sacks of general
trash. If you could place the cans in

 

 

 

ra

  

a separate container apart from the
trash, the ecology club will be able
to collect all of the cans without
having to rummage through all of
your garbage. When enough cans
are collected, they shall be sent to
a scrap metal place in Roanoke for
reprocessing.

The Ecology Club intends to col-
lect on a regular basis during rush
on the Saturday or Sunday after the
rush date combo party. We would
really appreciate your help. Thanks.

Though A Spyglass
Darkly

BY MARC SMALL

Although it may seem to be a
romantic figment from a long-dead
past, Washington & Lee once took
a certain amount of pride in its
academic reputation. While some
fulsome words of self-praise may
still on occasion be mouthed by
various reactionaires across campus,
those attempting to abide within the
honor code are forced to remain
mute on the subject. Has Washing-
ton & Lee not—by adopting the re-
vised curriculum currently in effect

—committed academic suicide?

For those who have came in late,
the “new” curriculum was a plan
adopted by the faculty in the Spring
of 1969 which enables students to
graduate fron W&L without taking
college-level courses in a foreign
language, to take a reduced load of
general liberal arts study, and, in
general, to replace academically
stimulating courses with inane and
often, to concur with President
Pompidou, “maladjusted” disciplines.

Should not college education be
made as difficult as possible, in or-
der to better challenge our intellects”
Should not the time and effort we
spend here be best spent in learning
the greatest possible amount and in
broadening our horizons so as to
best put this increased knowledge
into effect? Does not this slackening
of standards allow the incompetent
to clutter up the college with warm
but insensient bodies which take up
spaces that might otherwise be used
by those who desire to learn?

It does not take a detailed exami-
nation to reveal the general relaxa
tion of criteria that has taken place
in the two years since the revised
curriculum came into effect. One of
the more prominent department
heads told me last week that his
freshmen advisees were asking what

Student Body President
Discusses E.C. Plans

BY STEVE ROBINSON,
Student Body President

The year 1971-72 could be a mile-
stone for the Executive Committee
at Washington and Lee. For in addi-
tion to the normal duties of student
government and the Honor System,
this is a year in which the Executive
Committee will lessen the role of it-
self and the standing committees.

The faculty has hesitantly admitt-
ed, by the formation of the Univer-
sity Council, that students are able,
and should be allowed to play a
more significant role in the decision-
making processes of the University.
It is a great waste of time and ef-
fort for the students and faculty to
each have committees dealing with
the same subject, Several commit-
tees, such as the ones studying the
curriculum, admissions and the li-
brary, suffer from this duplicity.
However, the Faculty Curriculum
Committee is officially an ad hoc

body, despite the fact that it has
been in existence for a period of
four years, The apparent, and in my
opinion, best solution for this prob-
lem is joint student-faculty commit-
tees; not just groups on which stu-
dents have but one representative,
but committees that are equally di-
vided as to student-faculty composi-
tion.

The advantages of such member-
ship for the previously mentioned
committees is obvious. Initially, this
would eliminate the tandem opera-
tion of these organizations. Joint
committees would allow for a better
exchange of ideas between students
and faculty. This increased com-
munication would eliminate the con-
flicts of dual proposals and the prob-
lems that result from trying to re-
solve such plans, This should also
lead to better results from the indi-
viduals working in these groups.
Finally, this new plan would give
students the opportunity to be a

However, until these ideas are
realized, the Executive Committee
will continue to serve as the focal

cutive Committee,

attempt to ease this change towards

Assumed By
W&L Profs

BY PRESTON SIMPSON

Several administrators and faculty
members of Washington and Lee
University will play major roles in
state and local affairs as a result of
their elections or appointments to
significant government posts this
summer,

Dr. Charles F. Phillips, professor
of economics at W&L, has taken on
three significant positions outside
the university, Early in May of this
year Dr. Phillips was elected unop-
posed as Mayor of Lexington. He
had served as a member of City
Council since 1967.

In the same election Dr, Thomas
C. Imeson, associate professor of
chemistry at W&L, was elected to
the city council. Dr. Imeson is also
a leader in the effort to obtain a
municipal swimming pool for Lex-
ington and in the children’s break-
fast club program conducted at the
Robert E. Lee Memorial Episcopal
Church.

Both W&L faculty members were
sworn in to their positions at the
City Council meeting on July 1.

Also in May Dr. Phillips was
named to the board of the Lexing-
ton office of the First National Ex-
change Bank. In June he was elected
Chairman, for a one-year term, of
the Central Shenandoah Planning
District Committee. He moved up
from the vice chairman position by
defeating Staunton City manager
Edwin D. Martin by an 11-5 vote
with Mr. Martin abstaining.

Washington and Lee President
R.E.R. Huntley was appointed to a
special committee of the State Board
of Education last June. The three

Doremus To Open December 1

Four months behind the projected
18-month construction timetable and
3.2 million dollars later, the new
WAL sports arena, more commonly
referred to as a gymnasium, will of-
ficially open on December 1. Al-
though certain facilities will be
ready and in use before that date,
Athletic Director Bill McHenry
foresees the W&L vs. Virginia bas-
ketball game as the opener of not
only a_ successful basketball sea-
son but also a successful gym.

A Press Day tour of the multi-
million dollar complex, conducted
by McHenry himself, revealed little
doubt that the gym would not meet
its opening. Upon entering the new
complex from the old Doremus en-
trance, one faces the basketball
court. While still located on the
same level as the old court, two
elevated landings rise on both ends
of the baskets, to be used primarily
as recreational areas and for gym-
nastics. A press level runs along the
west wall midway between the floor
and the ceiling. Rollout bleachers
line the main floor with a capacity
of just over 2,000, Additional seats
can be arranged in those elevated
areas on both ends of the court for
an added capacity of 300.

Below the court rests three and
one half floors, the first of which
houses team rooms and showers, On
this floor and also the one beneath
it are eight handball and two squash
courts. This floor is the last one con-
nected with Doremus and it opens
into the current student locker
rooms, which are in the remodeling
stage. The second floor down again
houses team rooms and classrooms.
The third level is the home of the
new pool and diving area. While
only 25 yards long, the pool meas-
ures 200 yards wide and 12 feet at
its deepest. A three meter and one
meter board will be installed. Per-
manent concrete stands on one side
will seat approximately 300 to 500
spectators, The last and bottom half
level, holds the pool’s operating
equipment.

According to construction plans,
the circular drive in front of old
Doremus will be broken up and
grass planted. All gym parking will
be assigned to the three levels of
parking on the south side of the
site. Access to the lot will be from
Highway 60. The parking area could
be the only part of the plan not
completed by December 1.

As mentioned, parts of the gym

will be open prior to official dedica-

tion. The new basketball court
should be ready for the team to be-
gin practice in late October, The

pool will not be opened beforehand.
Several handball courts should also
be available in middle to late Octo-
ber,

Sophomore quarterback Steve Fluharty flings pass in loss to Randolph-Macon

Generals Bow To Randolph-Macon;
Team Meets Towson State Saturday

BY LEWIS HIXSON

It was a gallant but futile effort
on the part of Washington and Lee
Generals here Saturday in a losing
scrimmage with Randolph-Macon.
There were a few bright spots but
they came only in the mist of an
overall losing cause.

Steve Fluharty, though continu-
ously harrassed, showed he still has
the arm that enabled him to capture
a high position among small college
passers last season. Fluharty com-
pleted numerous passes to Bill Bald-
win and Chappy Conrad as the pair
showed they have the ability to be-
come excellent receivers. Lat Per-
cer and JoJo Martin gained good
yardage on quick openers and end
sweeps.

Even though there were good in-
dividual performances the W&L of-
fense as a whole was unable to put
together any sort of a concentrated

scoring effort. It still looks like one
of the major question marks this
season will be the offensive line.
Randolph-Macon’s defensive _ line
was continuously breaking through
to put pressure on Fluharty and any
sort of straight ahead plunge was
usually repulsed with ease. If W&L
is to have any sort of a successful
season this offensive line will have
to improve quite a bit.

When looking at the defense one
would have to wonder whether or
not the defense will be able to hold
this year’s opponents to the 250
points that were allowed last cam-
paign. The defensive secondary had
more holes than a slice of swiss
cheese. Randolph-Macon hit on
passes at will. The Generals’ de-
fensive line had its good plays and
its bad ones, the bad ones hurting a
great deal. One end sweep went for
a 35 yard touchdown,

When looking at the overall team
one can see that there will have to
be a significant improvement before
the Blue team can match powerful
Towson State in this year’s opener.
“We couldn't have picked a tougher
opening game,” commented Coach
Buck Leslie. Towson State promises
to have a big, strong team and the
Generals are certain to have their
hands full.

WAL dropped a 30-14 opener last
year to the Tigers.

Towson has one game already
under its belt, a 49-6 rout by Cen-
tral Connecticut that W&L Coach
Buck Leslie says is deceiving.

“Towson fell behind 24-0 in the
first quarter after a lost fumble and
several interceptions,” Leslie noted,
“and had to play ‘catch-up’ the rest
of the day.”

As a result, Towson threw 46
passes, completing 15 and having
five intercepted.

“| don’t look for them to throw
as much against us,” Coach Leslie
commented. “We know they prefer
to run more.”

Needless to say, Coach Leslie
will be stressing the goal line offense,
tackling and team pursuit in drills
this week in preparation for Satur-
day's 2:00 p.m. kickoff at Towson.

Baseball Note:

There will be a meeting of all
those interested in playing varsity
baseball tonight at 8:00 p.m. in the
meeting room upstairs in Doremus
Gymnasium.

Soccer Looks To Opener

BY CLIFF OVERCASH

“Once this club jives, it should be
a nice scoring machine,” commented
Coach Joe Lyles about this year’s
soccer team. Although a very young
team, this squad 1s laden with ex-
cellent depth; at present two full
starting teams could be fielded. The
team has been working hard, and
this has taken its toll in injuries.
Several players are hurt, among
them Jim Kahn with two bad knees,
Barry Gruters with a pulled groin
muscle, Rolf Piranian with a twisted
ankle, and several others with knee
and leg injuries. However, this has
failed to deter the team’s competi-
tiveness, and, as Coach Lyles point-
ed out, “it will be hard to keep this
team still.”

With the arrival of several out-
standing freshmen, including Gard-
ner Britt, Barclay Armstrong, Mike
Kurilez, Robert Crawford, John
Embree, and Chuck Alexander, the
team should have a youthful look.
The excellent play of one freshman,
Jimmy Fox, has been quite impres-
sive, and he is listed as a probable
starter. Having such a young team
has posed some problems that will
not and cannot be answered until
the season begins. Coach Lyles

stressed the importance of the play-
ers learning each other’s key moves
and said he really needs some more
scrimmages in order to accomplish
this. With only seven lettermen re-
turning from last year’s squad, most
coaches would be quite concerned,
but Coach Lyles said that this team
could receive Washington & Lee’s
next invitation to the National
Tournament.

The 1971 team, led by captains
Meade Kampfmuller and Brandon
Herbert, has on its schedule power-
ful foes such as William & Mary,
Dickinson, Madison, and Navy. The
Dickinson game, the team’s first, will
be played Saturday, September 25,
at 3:00 p.m, at home. This promises
to be a tough battle, as the W&L
team wants to revenge last year’s 1-0
loss. The Generals also have a re-
turn clash with V.M.L, a team that
has improved greatly over last year.
Coach Lyles promises that this will
be “spirited game.” On October 30,
Washington and Lee travels to An-
napolis to face the Naval Academy
in a game that should be quite ex-
citing. It is doubtful the Washington
and Lee team will have any trouble
getting up for this game, as Navy
always is ranked high in the collegi-

ate standings.

Although a lot has been said of
the excellent group of freshmen try-
ing out for a place on this year’s
team, there is also a fine array of
upperclassmen who will add the
needed experience to help this club
jell. Among them are Mike Shaeffer,
Bill Spofford, Rolf Piranian, John
Buckley, Dave Campbell, Kampf-
muller, and Herbert. They will be
leading the team’s probable 4-3-3
formation, one that will stress more
offense than defense. However, as
Coach Lyles put it, “a good defense
is your best offense.” For the first
time in a couple of years, the team
finally has some good “insides”, and
they won't have to rely on one or
two players to carry the burden of
work,

Also for the first time Washington
& Lee will have a JV team headed
by Assistant Coach John Griffith
from West Virginia Wesleyan. Coach
Griffith is presently a law student
here, and Head Coach Lyles says he
is doing a very fine job.

This year’s soccer team has in
front of it a very challenging season,
an dif the club lives up to the ex-
pectations of Coach Joe Lyles, it
could be a very successful one.

Harriers Ready
For ’71 Season

The W&L Cross-Country team
opens its 1971 season on Saturday,
October 2 against Centre College of
Danville. Kentucky, Coach Dick
Miller feels that the harriers will be
at least as strong as last year’s team,
which recorded a 7-3 record, al-
though they may not have as much
depth. Two a day practices were be-
gun on September 8 and the runners
quickly worked up to 10 or 12
miles per day.

Looking especially impressive dur-
ing the early practices have been
Bill Kalal, Bob Sherwood, and
freshman Harrison Turnbull. Hope-
fully returning runners Doug Me-
Neel, Jim Hornor, Carter Glass,
Tim Kearney, Prent Eager, and Jim
Haydon will provide the needed
depth. Other freshman prospects in-
clude Jeff Fischer, Dave Wallace,
and Dave Mycoff. Sherwood and
Glass are serving as co-captains this
fall.

consolidation.

The committee, along with several
local school superintendents and
other educators, including Dr. Phil-
lips of W&L, attended a meeting on
the question held in Richmond.

Dr. John DeVogt, head of the
W&L Department of Commerce,
was chosen to serve on the newly en-

Council selected Dr. DeVogt and
three others from a list of 28 names.

He was appointed on May 20,

Robinson On Honor Code

(Continued from page 1)

Honor is a relative matter. What
was considered dishonorable in 1910
may not be similarly judged today.
The key to the judgment of some
action as dishonorable is the values
and opinions of the students at W&L
today. Thus, you can see how your
own idea of honor is important.
Hopefully, this personal concept is
consistent with that of your contem-
poraries. However, if your ideas of
honor are vastly different from those
held by the rest of the student body,
it is advisable for you to discover
what thoughts of honor are held by
the majority of students, For it is
against these accepted provisions of
honor that you will be judged if
your honor is ever questioned.

The second responsibility is one
to all others who live under the sys-
tem. The honor system is not effec-
tive if those who violate it are not
discovered, Possible violations must
be brought to the attention of the
EC. By advising the Executive Com-
mittee of a possible honor violation,
you are not betraying the man. By
not telling the EC of a possible vio-
tion, you are failing to support the
honor system, and thereby helping
to destroy it.

If you are ever accused of an
honor violation, the EC will meet in
a preliminary hearing to consider
the evidence; if the committee feels
that there is sufficient evidence to in-
vestigate the circumstances  sur-
rounding the alleged violation, the
regular hearing will be held.

This hearing is not a criminal
proceeding; the Executive Commit-
tee is not trying to prosecute indi-
viduals. On the contrary, this hear-
ing is an investigative session. The
EC is only to discover the facts sur-
rounding the incident.

The Honor System has but one
penalty for a violation, and that is
dismissal from the University. There
has been considerable criticism of
the absolute penalty; many people
have thought a system of graduated
penalties would be more desirable
than the present system. But there
are no gray areas in the issue of
honor. And since a man knows
about the Honor System when he
comes to WA&L, if he does not
choose to perpetuate the ideas by
which we all abide, he need not re-
main.

It has been said that the Honor

System is Washington & Lee. I do
not believe this. Without the Honor
System, however, W&L, as we know
it, would disappear, for the honor
system does embody the spirit of
Washington and Lee. And for that
reason, it is something we must per-
petuate,

The fact that you are here indi-
cates that you have at least made the
initial commitment to the Honor
System and your own sense of
honor. Yet there is no assurance that
you will always abide by the Honor
System during your four years at
W&L. To violate the Honor System,
however, is to shirk your responsi-
bility toward the system, and to par-
tially destroy a way of life at Wash-
ington and Lee.

The Honor System has existed for
so many years because students be-
fore you have accepted an defended
its values. Every class before you
has been able to gather the benefits
of the honor system, preserving it
for future W&L students, It is up to
each student to maintain this heri-
tage.

Watercolors

In Bookstore

Fifteen watercolor paintings by
Prof. Marion M. Junkin, noted
American artist and former head of
Washington and Lee University’s
fine arts department, are on exhibi-
tion currently in the university
paperback bookstore.

The show will continue through
late October, according to Mrs. Ro-
bert Munger, manager. Hours are
from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.
to 10 p.m. each weekday.

In addition to his watercolors,
Dr. Junkin will have on exhibit
specially created copper etchings,
one of the Washington and Lee
campus and another of neighboring
Virginia Military Institute. The etch-
ings — already matted — will be
available in limited editions of 100,

signed by the artist, at $25 each,

Prof. Junkin, a native of Korea, is
a 1927 graduate of Washington and
Lee. He headed Vanderbilt Univer-
sity’s fine arts department before re-
turning to his alma mater in 1949 as
founder and head of the department.
In that year Washington and Lee
awarded him an honorary doctorate
in fine arts.

He is exceptionally well known
for his murals as well as his paint-
ings. He has painted frescoes in
corporate and public buildings and
colleges throughout the nation, and
his paintings are included in many
of the country’s most noteworthy
collections,

Though he retired from admini-
strative duties in the fine arts de-
partment in 1969, Dr, Junkin con-
tinues to teach full-time and to
paint.

Graduate Record Exam
Will be Given Oct. 23

Educational Testing Service has
announced that undergraduates and
others preparing to go to graduate
school may take the Graduate Rec-
ord Examinations on any of six diff-
erent test dates during the current
academic year.

The first testing date for the GRE
is October 23, 1971. Scores from
this administration will be reported
to the graduate schools around De-
cember 1. Students planning to regi-
ster for the October test date are
advised that applications received
by ETS after October 5 will incur a
$3.50 late registration fee. After
October 8, there is no guarantee that
applications for the October test
date can be processed.

The other five test dates are De-
cember 11, 1971, January 15, Feb-
ruary 26, April 22, and June 17,
1972. Equivalent late fee and regis-
tration deadlines apply to these
dates. Choice of test dates should be
determined by the requirements of
graduate schools or fellowships to
which one is applying. Scores are
usually reported to graduate schools
five weeks after a test date.

Full details and registration forms
may be obtained in Dean Watt's of-
fice.

sity of lowa, has been praised for its
strong discipline and range of emo-
tion. Their repetoire encompasses
both classical and modern quartet
literature.

Ohemes, violin, John Ferrell, violin,
William Preucil, viola, and Charles
Wendt, cello.

Dr. James G. Leyburn, Washing-
ton and Lee Professor of Sociology,

color humor.” The group sings
without accompaniment and incor-
porates a four-part harmony.

Founded in 1956 by a group of
drinking buddies who, as Gillespie
noted, “just got together to sing,”
the Sazeracs perform annually at
Parents Weekend, at nearby girls’
schools, conventions, and serosts.
The highlight of the year is their
spring trip to Palm Beach, Florida
where they perform for one week at
the Taboo Club.

For any interested freshmen, the
Sazeracs are holding tryouts next
Monday and Tuesday nights, from
8:00 to 9:00 in the Music Room of
the Student Center.

Washington and Lee in 1947, Dr.
Leyburn has performed several re-
citals, accompanied visiting artists
and played the organ for many
church services in Lexington.

Dr. Leyburn’s program may be
entitled “18th Century Composers
and Their 20th Century Admirers.”

On March 14, the Philador Trio
will present a concert of Baroque
music. Each of the performers have
been members of the New York Pro
Musica, for several years, They are
Elizabeth Humes, soprano, Shelly
Fruskin, baroque flute and record-
ers, Edward Smith, harpsichord,

All concerts are free to Washing-
ton and Lee students.

the right to vote. He is married and
works for the university in the Ad-
missions Office. Therefore, he must
be classified a relatively stable resi-
dent, evidenced by the fact Bill re-
mained in Lexington this summer to
work. The rationale utilized by the
City Registrar appears to be some-
what lacking indeed. JWR

‘“Non-events”’ cited
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Just a footnote to your editorial
comments last week on this past
summer's non-events. There are two
things you failed to mention which
I consider significant. One is the
Lexington Fine Arts Workshop held
on this campus during the four
weeks of July. Offering daily courses
in art, music, drama, and dance, the
workshop was attended by some
sixty children from the Lexington
area. The staff included a large num-
ber of people from the W&L com-
munity.

The other event is the emergence
of a new community trouble center
called Reach-Out. This referral and
counseling center will serve the Lex-
ington Rockbridge area and is being
staffed by trained volunteers. Here
again, the staff includes a number of
people from the campus community.

These two events, I feel, are signi-
ficant new breakthroughs in our
town-gown relations and deserve
recognition,

BY RAY SWANN
Auditions are being held this week

Bergman Film Screened
In Reid’s Cinema Series

One of the most brilliant cine-
matic efforts by the Swedish director
Ingmar Bergman, “Wild Strawber-
ries,” will be presented Monday,
October 4, beginning at 7:30 p.m. in
Reid Hall Auditorium. The film is
the second in a series of classics pro-
cured for Professor O. W. Riegel’s
introductory course on the Motion
Picture; anyone interested is invited
to attend the screening.

“Wild Strawberries” appeared in
1957, and immediately the film cap-
tured critical accolades for its intro-
spection, imagination, and superb
performances, It is noted especially
for its dream sequences, through
which Bergman traces the develop-
ment of a Swedish family through
three successive generations.

The film focuses on the elderly
character of Isak Borg, warmingly
portrayed by Victor Sjostrom, who
Bergman follows through a series of
dreams which recall his past and his
fear of death and sterility, An in-
strumental character in his images,
the Sara of Isak's youth, who repre-
sents the product of a strictly moral
and inhibited upbringing, is contrast-
ed with the later Sara of Isak's eld-
erly years, who portrays freedom
and responsibility from familial sup
pression

Though the regulars of many of
Bergman's later works, Max Von Sy
dow and Liv Lilman, are absent in

Wild Strawberries,” this early film
does mark one of the first appear

ances of Bibi Andersson as the two
Saras, Andersson has been recently
acclaimed for her performance of a
tortured Swedish housewife in love
with Eliott Gould in Bergman's first
English language production, “The
Touch.”

Critics and Bergman fans have al-
ways regarded “Wild Strawberries”
as a hallmark in the Swedish artist's
brilliant, though uneven, career, It
has always been one of Bergman's
most cherished films, because in it
Bergman was able to achieve an
unsurpassed degree of tranquillity
and resolution, Bergman's films, in
addition, have always been noted for
their stark, textured photography
which simply fills the eye, and
“Wild Strawberries” is no exception
in this respect.

The first film in the WAL series,
an uncut version of D. W. Griffith's
“Birth of a Nation” was shown to
SRO crowds for two nights. Motion
pictures to follow throughout the
season are classics by such noted di

rectors as Murnau, Renoir, Rene
Clair, and Carol Reed.

being formed to play at the open
ing of the new gym and other home

Candidates must be nominated by
Liaison Officers of their undergra-
duate institutions by November 1,
1971. The Foundation does not ac-
cept direct applications for the Fel-
lowships.

Those who receive the fellowship
get four years of financial assistance,
with a maximum annual living sti-
pend of $2,700 for single Fellows
and $2,950 for married Fellows,
plus tuition and fees. Dependency
allowances are available. Financial
need is not a condition for consid-
eration.

Danforth Fellows may hold cer-
tain other fellowships such as Ford,
Fulbright, National Science, Rhodes,
etc, concurrently and will be Dan-
forth Fellows without stipend until
the other awards lapse. They may
also be designated honorary Wood
row Wilson Fellows,

The Danforth Foundation, created
in 1927, is a philanthropy concerned
primarily with people and values.
Presently the Foundation focuses its
activities in two major areas, educa
tion and the city. In these areas the
Foundation administers programs
and makes grants to schools, col-
leges, universities and other public
and private agencies.

The last WAL recipient was form-
er Student Body President Marvin
C,. “Swede” Henberg. who went on
to graduate study in Philosophy at
the University of Texas. Henberg
will continue as a Danforth Fellow
following his two years with the
Rhodes Scholarship in Great Britain

 

1965. Finding that he disliked act-
ing, he became interested in stage
managering and directing. His di-
rectorial credits include “The Re-
storation of Arthur Middleton” by
David Storey and several plays by
Christopher Hampton, including
“Total Eclipse” and “The Philan-
thropist.” The latter is playing its
second year in London and is pres-
ently a hit in New York with Alec
McGowen.

Kidd has also recently done work
for Grenada Television, with such
noted actors as Alec Guiness,

Mr. Lee Kahn, W&L professor of
drama, spent last year on leave in
Great Britain and Europe, met Kidd
there, and asked him to come to
WA&L to work with the Troubadour
rheatre.

“It's something I fancied doing
for some time,” said Mr. Kidd. “I'd
rather work in this environment than
in some taddy old reportory theatre
in North Scotland.”

His approach to Macbeth is not
yet firmly plotted. “You would like
to tackle it as you would a new
play,” he remarked. “It's a young
man’s play. You do it as truthfully
and as accurately as possible.”

He acknowledged that the langu-
age of the play is archaic and will
pose a problem to the student actors,
but expressed hope that the produc-
tion will still be new and vital

EC Establishes
New Committee
To Plan Dorm

The Executive Committee, meet-
ing in regular session Monday night,
established a student advisory com-
mittee to aid University officials in
the planning of the new upperclass
dormitories to be built in the ravine
in the back campus. There will be a
general meeting of all interested in
serving on such a committee next
Tuesday, October 5, at 7 p.m. in the
EC room of the Student Center.

In other business, the EC estab-
lished dates for a Dance Board con-
cert, approved the purchase of a
new photograph reproducer for the

t, Tomorrow

under a grant from the Glasgow En-
dowment Foundation, which brings
prominent lecturers and teachers in
the arts and literature to the W&L
campus. The last visitor under a
Glasgow grant was author Reynolds
Price, who spent three weeks in Lex-
ington last spring to work with stu-
dents and to lecture on fiction.

The production of “Macbeth” will
be presented starting Wednesday,
November 3, and will continue
through the following Saturday, No-
vember 6. The Troubadours will fol-
low this with a presentation of John
Osborne's biographical drama, “Lut-
her,” in February.

Ring-tum Phi, and announced two
openings for students on the Uni-
versity Committee on Intercollegiate
Athletics.

Student Body President Steve Rob-
inson revealed that Dean of Students
Lewis G. John and Assistant to the
President Frank Parsons have re-
quested student representatives who
can join them in preliminary meet-
ings with the architect concerning
the new dormitories, The purpose of
a student planning committee, ac-
cording to Robinson, “is to help de-
sign the structure and to focus on
the needs—both in facilities and
student capacity—of the prospective
upperclass dormitories.” The admini-
stration hopes that construction of
the new dorms could be completed
some time next year.

The committee would hopefully
be composed mainly of freshmen

Bill Merrill was appointed to head
up the effort of forming the student
advisory body.

In other EC activities, a resolution
was passed confirming February 12
as the date for the Dance Board's
Fancy Dress concert. It was also an-
nounced that there were openings
for two students on the University
Committee on Athletics, a group
which will be instrumental this year
in helping the new Director, Wil-
liam McHenry. The positions are
left vacant by two graduated seniors,
Bill Brumback and Drew Kumpuris,
and all interested students are en-
couraged to place a written applica-
tion in the EC box of the Student
Center by 6 p.m. Monday, October
4, and expect to appear personally
before the EC at 7 p.m. that night.

The EC also agreed that any girl
enrolled this year at W&L under
the exchange program, as well as
any regularly enrolled W&L stu-
dent, will be considered for openings
on the EC subcommittees, Applica-
tions will be taken at the end of
next month, with a date to be an-
nounced in a forthcoming EC mect-

On W&L Shoplifting,

If you venture into the Co-op, bookstore or library of sev-
eral American colleges or universities, you would be shocked,

Spanish Inquisition.

course to curtail the spiralling rate of pilfering, shoplifting

“disappearances of |

On this page is a letter from an employee of the Book-
store. Briefly stated, that letter points to a growing problem.
Evidently, some expensive books are missing from the shelves
and there are no records indicating sales of these volumes.
The student employees of the Bookstore usually do not remain
at the counter like watchdogs, rather a great portion of their
labor is spent among the shelves or in the workroom. The
opportunity for “five finger discount” is virtually omni-present.

Along a similar vein, several reference books also “dis-
appeared” from McCormick Library last year. Many volumes
just could not be located in the Reference Room. Encyclo-
pedias were quite liable to be unavailable for use to interested
students.

The Bookstore and McCormick Library cannot smilingly
absorb such losses. Individuals at both locations are account-
able for these books. Their only alternatives to such problems
may be crackdowns on student privileges.

The central issue is not purging violators via honor trials.
It is facetious to believe that such a course of action will cause
the books to reappear or stop “disappearances” in the future.

Instead, the central issue must be will the W&L students
allow their privileges under the existing Honor System format
to “disappear” as these books have? Would you like shop-
lifting mirrors in the Bookstore? Does the idea of having un-
proctored exams appeal to you? Do you enjoy having your
word taken for the truth? Does it mean anything to you to
trust your fellow members of the Washington and Lee stu-
dent body?

If you value these privileges and traditions, then do some-
thing to preserve them. Rededicate yourself to the spirit of the
Honor System. That does not mean you automatically assume
the role of a Gestapo agent. It does mean conducting your-
self with honor and demanding that your fellow students do
the same. The alternatives are both plain and unappealing.

Thanks To V.M.L

Washington and Lee University and Virginia Military
Institute are not exactly intimate although their campuses
adjoin. The last football game between the colleges (around
the turn of the century) almost resulted in the leveling of
Lexington. Most W&L men do not know a single “Vemee”
and the closeness is reciprocated by many cadets.

But the university now stands in debt to VMI. While
Doremus Gymnasium is under construction, V MI has allowed
the boys from down the street to use their handball courts
and weights.

Over the last year a significant number of men have taken
advantage of this opportunity, The university itself conducts
Physical Education courses in handball at VMI.

When the new handball courts are ready for use in Dore-
mus sometime next month, the crowds will return to W&L
But it would be ungrateful to omit a word of thanks to VMI
for its tolerance, Therefore, VMI, thank you, Perhaps the two

The Spring Term this year will
see a second group of Washington
and Lee students studying in Europe,
sponsored by the foreign language
departments. This program, which
began last year, is open to students
of virtually any major, and is in
fact particularly beneficial to a non-
language major. Materials that a

student might never have access to
in the U.S. can be used while in
Europe, greatly enriching the stu-

dent's experience. The benefits for a
language major are obvious with the
constant contact of a foreign langu-
age and the chance to “live” a langu-
age, rather than just practice it. The
program then, has great potential
for all who participate.

To be eligible for the program, a
student must not be on academic
probation; he must be an upperclass-
man except in very special circum-
stances; and he must successfully
complete French 161-2, Spanish 161-

“Letting Go”’

 

BY LEX McMILLAN

The world stirred with the then
treacherous blasphemy of individual
freedom, equality and democracy.
Out of the turmoil was born Ameri-
ca of the Eighteenth Century. With
dreams once thought madness and
scoffed at by much of the rest of the
world America attempted to find a
method of government which would
forever rid men of monarchy and
selfish autocracy, In the dream was
the vision of a government which
would select leaders in such a way
as to draw out the very best men.
Through democracy and education
it was hoped that the most moral
most enlightened men would come
front to lead the people.

Those were the illusory days of
idealistic young radicals when the
country, as yet still struggling out of
the womb, was in a state of purity,
The purifying agent being flux and
turmoil, Men were performing at
their best because the ground be-
neath them constantly moved and
forced the heroic out of them,

Now our country is settled, The
wild savages have been fenced in,
the land “conquered”, the moon
brought to earth. Now in spite of a
new turmoil the leaders are compla
cent, overfed and entrenched. The
new rebellion is used to feed the
fears of the comfortable and further
guarantee the perpetuation of the
“established order”

Within that order is the well de
fined structure for election to high
office, specifically the Presidency. In
the tradition of government by the
people and stemming from the great
faith in the enlightening power of
education stands the institution of
the Washington and Lee Mock Con
vention

Proudly boasting its record of
realism the Mock Convention is a
stage play skillfully produced and di
rected by children in rigid and ob
edient immitation of their irrevoc
ably corrupt adult counterparts

The Convention system is so rigid
and calcified that it has shaken the
belief that any man can be Presi
dent. Any man cannot be President
Bright faces dart past our view and
are obliterated in the play of power
politics in our Corporate State. In
1968 there was the hope of men like

Robert Kennedy and Eugene Mc-
Carthy. One killed and the other ex-
cluded, The election was a non-
choice. One had the right to select
between two examples of mediocrity.

All indications are that in 1972
we will have the same lack of
choice. It also seems that this trend
will continue indefinitely with in-
creased rigidity. And of course our
Mock Convention will accurately
predict this. They will carefully
study the political situation in each
state, in the nation as a whole and
very like select the very man who
will be selected several months later
in the real convention, Won't that be
wonderful? Then W&L can proudly
sit back and chalk up another accur-
ate prediction to fortify its record of
realism. How utterly gratifying.
How positively exhilarating!

In so doing we help perpetuate
the corruption of the system. On the
other hand, why couldn't we at-
tempt to set a moral example? The
political situation could be studied
and realism strived for but at the
same time alternatives sought to our
present National Convention system.
With all the time, money and intelli-
gence which goes into a mimickry,
why couldn't W&L attempt to show
America that there might be a way
to again guarantee the people a real

2, or German 261-2, or the equiva-
lent. For the French and Spanish
program he must also have $1000,
for the German, $900.

If all requirements are met, he
must then be approved by the For-
eign Study Committee. A student
going on the program can expect to
spend most of his spring vacation in
Lexington doing extensive prepara-
tion for the trip.

While these trips are certainly an
excellent opportunity to have a great
time, there is still some work in-
volved. A project that is worth 3
credits in the student’s major field
must be planned and approved be-
fore departure, and executed during
free time in Europe, The program is
good for three additional credits in
the appropriate language, and is the
result of the classes and experience
that comes with the trip. Classes
generally occupy three hours every
morning, with visits to museums
some afternoons, and the theatre
and opera at nights, Otherwise there
is ample free time to work on pro-
jects and to enjoy the surroundings.
some weekends are reserved for
short trips, while others are free.

The French program is headquar-
tered at Reid Hall in Paris, a build-
ing that belongs to Columbia Uni-
versity. While students live with
families in Paris and eat breakfast
and dinner with them, they attend
their classes and eat lunch at Reid
Hall. Respected teachers give lec-
tures on contemporary theatre, mod-
ern art, and literature. Students
from the Sorbonne come for infor-
mal discussions,

Sex Book Ripped Off

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Our society being what it is today
(which, according to one’s predilec-
tions, may mean virtually anything),
sex has become a topic both of
frank discussion and explicit pictor-
ials. The Bookstore has briefly ac-
quired one of these pictorials com-
plete with frank discussion. The Sex
Book: A Modern Pictorial Encycleo-
pedia has been published by Herder
& Herder, that once staid, straight-
lace religious publisher.

We quote Publisher’s Weekly:
“Werner Linz, vice president of
Herder, who was instrumental in

getting The Sex Book-originally pub-
lished in Germany—rewritten for
the U.S. and published here, calls it
‘pioneering in an area where major
re-education must take place.’ News-
week called it ‘bold and useful’;
Time said it was ‘explicit and hu-
mane’, we say simply that it is very
beautiful and about time.” Mr. Linz
is confident, by the way, that it will

 

g to kurope

While it costs more to be in Paris,
the French capital has everything

that the students need for their
studies and to keep them busy,
While. many Parisians speak Eng-

lish, and therefore oceasionally there
is slightly less opportunity to pract-
ice French, this factor is not of
major importance, as the program is
not solely for learning the language.

The Spanish program is located in
Madrid, and while prices are high,
the city has the best in museums,
theatre, folklore, and bullfights. The
students in Madrid also live with
local families, and attend the same
sort of classes as the French students
do. They attend the Institute Inter-
national with native instructors. Sev-
eral one day visits outside Madrid
are planned,

The German pregram is the only
one that is not located in a major
city. Because the students live in
Bayreuth, there is less and
more weekends are allowed for paid
travel. To get the feel of the larger
cities, the program spends the last
week or so seeing places such as
Munich. In Bayreuth students attend
classes at a teacher's college and
follow much the same routine in the
mornings as the other programs do.

Since Spring is still many months
away and students have not been
registered and approved for the pro-
gram, many details of the time spent
abroad, departure and return dates,
and the like have not been deter-
mined yet. In a few weeks, a meet-
ing will be held where all interested
students can talk with teachers and
“veterans” of the program.

‘The Birth of A Nation’ Shows

sGriffith’s Cinema Innovations

BY MARK McMINN

“The task I’m trying to achieve is
above all to make you see.”
D. W. Griffith

Not since the recent interment of
Traveller (hopefully for the last
time), has an event on this campus
been greeted with such enthusiasm
as was the September 20 screening
of D. W. Griffith's The Birth of A
Nation,

The SRO audience, comprised of
three generations, witnessed the
work of a primordial poet of sorts.
David Mark Griffith created the art
of film, refining many elements such
as the close-up, camera angle, edit-
ing and lighting into a new language,
a fresh syntax of cinema. The Birth
of A Nation is, in this sense, an ex-
ample of the contribution which
D. W. Griffith left to the world of
film.

Our schooling in the cinema has
been diametrically opposed, in ways,
to our education in the other arts,
ie., we tend to start with the pres-
ent and work toward the past. This
places us at a disadvantage in that
we tend to take for granted the dy-
namics of the close-up or a jump
cut, dismissing the early film-makers
as somewhat primitive.

Griffith had to overcome the ad-
vantage of the three dimensional
stage and develop a technique which
would impart, with effectiveness, his
imagination and perceptions onto
the two dimensional screen. He fre-
quently changed the position of his
camera, taking advantage of the
lighting, to give his characters a
greater dynamism. He would fill the
frame with face, be it the Little
Colonel or Elsie Stoneman, and
force the viewer to see only what he
wished him to see.

Likewise, he discovered that the
length of time a shot would appear
on the screen was directly propor-
tional to the tension it would pro-
duce: the shorter the shot, the great-
er the excitement. Thus, in the shot
of the Clansmen riding to the rescue
of the people in the shack, the emo-
tion of the audience was allowed to
rise as the climax neared,

Griffith was the first to utilize
the still photograph in the motion
picture. With the shot of the dead

25 YEARS GUARANTEE;

 

man on the battlefield, he was able
to convey to the viewer the feeling
that time no longer moved.

Griffith also possessed the ability
to avail himself of the audience’s
sense of equilibrium to the fullest
extent, establishing time and place
with a minimum of footage. He fre-
quently jumped from the middle of
one action to the middle of another
and yet the audience understood.

In his lifetime, David Mark Grif-
fith made some 432 films, sometimes
at the rate of two a week. No
theme was too ambitious for him;
and despite the fact that his films

The famous (or infamous) “War-
ren Court” is now dead, in case you
hadn't heard. The two vacancies to
be filled by the Nixon administra-
tion will make it a Nixon-dominat-
ed Court. This would indeed be un-
fortunate for the American people,
whether they think so or not at this
time.

Nixon and his various lackeys are
now involved in the process of ex-
cavating some suitably moderate
conservative and most especially
non-controversial men to fill the
seats left empty by Mr. Justice Har-
lan and the late Mr. Justice Black.
Chances are their replacements will
be mediocre, but then this would
make them fit in well with many
of the Nixon appointees in the Exe-
cutive branch of the government;
the President is consistent in some
things.

This would create a new-found
harmony between the Executive and
Judicial branches of the government,

grossed over 60 million dollars, he
was unemployed at the end of his
life.

Nevertheless, James Agee wrote
of Griffith: “He was a primitive poet,
a man capable, as only great and
primitive artists can be, of intuitively
perceiving and perfecting the tre-
mendous magical images that under-
lie the memory and imagination of
entire peoples .. . There is not a
man working in movies, or a man
who cares for them, who does not
owe Griffith more than he owes
anybody else.”

EES

Nixon wholly approves of as long as
he is President. FDR had somewhat
the same idea; he just went about it
in a more forward manner, which is
not the way Richard Nixon does
things.

The two new Justices will un-
doubtedly be somewhat to the right
of what is known as liberal; they
will probably be men who favored
the Lockheed loan, which is a good
example of the new version of “the
American Way” we all love so
dearly, in this case a matter of big
business influencing government
more than it should. Things such as
the Lockheed loan and certain in-
dustrial interests of long standing
which have managed to keep our
involvement in Indochina going
strongly have managed to change
the U.S. image around the globe in
a somewhat unfavorable way, Dollar
diplomacy just isn’t selling too well
any more,

But to get back to the supposed
subject of the Supreme Court, it
must be said that a conservative
leaning by the Court at this stage
of our nation’s development could
easily create in whole or in part
what many people, albeit ignorantly
for the most part, want at this time:
some form of a police state. This is
closely linked to the idea that “law
and order” is something which can
be maintained through force. It
can. A shining example of a govern-
ment which did this is Adolf Hitler's
Third Reich, to shoot again a very
dead but very true horse.

The idea of security for personal
material property has far overridden
the considerations the creators of
the U.S. Constitution and especially
the Bill of Rights were so careful to
insure: the rights of the individual
over against the society. A striking
observation I and many others have
made is that people, myself included,
usually acquiesce to the various
forms of repression imposed on us

system, which I have found to be
happening to a lot of people lately.
Only when this occurs do we realize
that “law and order” is a very sharp
two-edged sword,

Granted it is in a few instances
necessary to tread on an individual's
rights for the protection of the rights
of “the many,” the exercise of such
power is constantly bordering on an
ever-changing fine line between jus-
tice and tyranny. It is the case of
using power for its own sake rather
than with a useful and good purpose
in mind,

Our prison system is a sparkling
example of what this kind of think-
ing can result in; there are a quar-
ter of a million people in prisons in
this country, and one and a half
million will pass in and out of penal
institutions during 1971, according
to the Associated Press. The indi-
vidual rights which should protect
these people as well as ourselves, are
what the “Warren Court” was pri-
marily concerned with. They recog-
nized a responsibility to the Con-
stitution at a time when “public
opinion” was in favor of taking a
somewhat different course for our
nation, back in the dark days of the
Cold War, Joe McCarthy and other
outstanding happenings of the
1950's. It is fortunate for us today
that while the legislative and execu-
tive branches of the government
were becoming increasingly involved
in what are termed “shady” activities
at the least, that the Judicial branch
could figuratively step out of the
situation and see our nation in a
more complete perspective, and
make their decisions from this ad-
vantageous viewpoint.

Doing this is the function of the
Court, though not many people
know it. The Court's decisions don't

Blue Ridge Mountains will find a
few unusual things (newcomers will
find almost EVERYTHING unus-
ual). They are advised to retreat into
smug superiority, to try to become as
one with their environment, or for-
get about it.

Once again, many of the local eat-
eries have changed management.
One suspects that the same people
are always in control of the hash
houses, and they are simply playing
a game of Musical Cash Registers.

It will come as no surprise to me
(but then, what does, any more?)
that most of you have forgotten
what life here is really like.

However, after you have gotten
wall-eyed five times in a week, and
it’s only Tuesday, after you have sat
in a darkened movie house watching
“Bride of the Nephew of Franken-
stein’s Cleaning Lady Goes Ha-
waiian or Worse” so many times
you can chant the lines right along
with the best of them and are in
serious danger of O.D.ing on stale
popcorn; after you have gone down
the road so many times that the
faculties of Southern Sem, Hollins
and Sweet Briar are thinking of
charging you a matriculation and
off-campus student fee, then perhaps
you will remember.

By then, of course, it will be too
late, and the insidious plot laid
generations ago by Subversive
Forces posing as local rednecks,
carpetbaggers and other native fau-
na, a plot designed to take some of
America’s finest young minds (and
you thought that for a minute there
| was talking about YOU, right?
You should live so long) and turn
them into lifelong mental cripples,
birdbaths, or John Birchers, will
have claimed another victim.
However, by carefully following

 

the suggested activities presented
here by the editors of this paper, in
a humanitarian effort to save you
from yourself, you just might pull
through. Then again, you might not,
but at least this way you'll have a
sporting chance.

1, Go around in a_ three-piece
suit (preferably blue) and wingtip
shoes (preferably brown), Wear a
skinny tie. Tell everyone you see
that you are an Undercover Hippie.

2. Ask a policeman if the swal-
lows really aren't coming back to
Capistrano this year.

3. Write the words to the “W&L
Swing” on the head of a pin. Stick
yourself with it.

4. Call up any nearby airport
and ask them when the Hindenberg
dirigible is due to dock.

5. Stop someone on the street and
tell them that you are Calvin Cool-
idge. Ask if anyone’s missed you yet.

6. Go to someone’s house and
knock on the door, Tell them you
are there for the Venetian blind. If
they give you one of those things
hanging in the window, _ say,
“Thanks. This will buy a lot of
dark glasses and canes,”

7. Write Ann Landers and tell her
you know who she is, what she does,
and you have photos to prove it.
Really give her something to worry
about!

After spending a week or so con-
centrating on these pleasant, divert-
ing activities, you should be ready
for anything Lexington, Washington
and Lee, or anything else has to
offer. Doing them in two or three
days should prepare you for any-
thing the world has to offer. Doing
them all in one day should prepare
you for a nice session of shock
therapy.

Good luck!

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

BY BOB “LASH” LARUE

There’s no joy in Mudville, since
Casey Jones struckout. Translated in
1971, that line might read no joy in
Washington, D.C., since Bob Short
missed three straight. Never has the
Capital City been as furious since
the British burned the burg during
the War of 1812. Casting covetous
eyes towards the Lone Star State,
Short moved his baseball Senators to
Dallas—Fort Worth, the crossroads
best noted for right-wing politics
and cattle drives, respectively.

To be sure, there is method in
Short’s seeming madness, While the
switch may provoke some legislative
wrath, the baseball lobby will prob-
ably ease any political resentment by
moving the San Diego Padres into
Washington.

This turnabout is feasible despite
the avowed veto by Baltimore's
Jerry Hoffberger, whose action to is-

| aRue’s Pressbox
Senators to Dallas?

olate D. C. is effective only against
the movement of American League
teams. Much to Hoffberger’s regret,
the Padres belong to the National
League.

Anyway, Short’s withdrawal for
points west is probably a wise ven-
ture from a financial view. The Dal-
las-Fort-Worth fans who have been
brought up on a diet of minor lea-
gue baseball.

With the Houston Astros to the
south, the North Texans, who earl-
ier travelled to see the Dome, will
now be able to view major-league
teams in their neck of the woods. In
addition, the transplanted club will
atract baseball-crazy fans from the
adjoining states of Oklahoma and
Arkansas.

Secondly, Short would have been
committing economic suicide to stay
in RFK Stadium under the leasing
conditions provided by the D. C.
Armory Board. Granted, Short’s pe-
cuniary miscues accelerated his
crisis, but with the rental hardships
placed upon him by the stadium's
keepers, the retreat would have been
a mere matter of time.

However, the lords of baseball
should not let Washington suffer the
permanent loss of its team. A Wash-
ington without baseball is as custo-
mary as Hollywood without movies
and movie stars. San Diego, a desert
in an oasis of baseball teams, has

Junior quarterback Steve Fluharty races out of the pocket to gain yardage in W&L’s 10-7 loss to Towson
State, Fluharty was hurt on the play and sophomore Lewis Powell guided the offense the remainder of the game.

Towson State Scores In Final
Minutes Hands W&L 10-7 Loss

BY LEWIS HIXSON

The Washington and Lee Gen-
erals lost a close game in the final
minutes last Saturday against Tow-
son by a 10 te 7 score. The Gen-
erals led by a 7 to 3 margin for
most of the game until Bobby Roche
passed to Stu Remeto for a 13 yd.
score with 2:26 left in the fourth
quarter. John Glass added the extra
point to give Towson a 10 to 7 lead
and eventually the game.

The Generals received the open-
ing kickoff and John Loesing re-
turned it 18 yds. to the 35. Jim
Farrar was then sent into the line 3
straight times gaining 12 yds. and a
first down. Steve Fluharty went to
the air, after a 2 yd. loss by JoJo
Martin on a pitchout, but was un-
successful and W&L was forced
to kick it away. Chappy Conrad
punted 44 yds. to the Towson 16
where Mike Wells fielded it and
returned it to his own 30, The Gen-

eral defense then started off the
season on the right foot by holding
the Tigers to 1 yd. on their first 3
downs and forcing them to punt it
away. Dave Brooks received the
punt on his own 33 yd. line and
returned it 24 yds. to the Towson
43. With the ball in good field posi-
tion the Blue were able to gain only
2 yds. in 3 downs as 2 Fluharty
passes fell incomplete. Conrad never
got his punt away as the Tigers
came through to block it and obtain
good field position in General ter-
ritory at the 36. Richard Young and
David Franklin then combined their
running ability to move the ball to
the Generals 17 yd. line. The Blue
defense then got it together and
stopped the Tigers to make it 4th
down and 9 yds. to go. In came
John Glass for a field goal attempt.

His kick was true and with 6:42 re-
maining in the Ist period, the Tigers
lead 3 to 0.

Neither team was able to score
the rest of the first period. Near the
end of the second period Steve Flu-
harty was racked up after gaining
7 yds. and was forced to leave the
game. Lewis Powell was sent in with
the ball on the W&L 36 to re-
place Fluharty. Powell then pro-
ceeded to move the Generals down-
field hitting on almost every pass to
such receivers as Conrad, Martin,
and Lane. Then with two seconds re-
maining in the half, Powell found
Martin in the end zone with a 10
yd. scoring pass. Doug Chase boot-
ed the extra point and the Generals
held a 7-3 halftime lead.

Towson then kept W&L in the
hole on two series of downs under
the leadership of Mike Ciceie. The
General defense then made a terrific
goal line stand holding the Tigers to
no yards in 4 plays.

Towson then kept W and L in the
hold on two series of downs until a
beautiful 52 yd. punt by Conrad put
them back in their own territory.
Both teams were unable to gain any
advantage until late in the 4th quar-
ter when Towson got the ball on
their own 32 after a Conrad punt.
With Bob Roche at the helm again,
the Tigers drove deep into the Gen-
erals territory. On 4th down 7 yds,
to go on the General 13 yd. line,
Roche dropped back and hit Reme-
fo with a pass in the end zone for a
score. Glass added the point after,
and with 2:26 remaining in the

Booters Fall 2-1
On Ref’s Error

Sentiments and anger flew last
Saturday afternoon when Dickinson
captured a non-league game from
the Washington and Lee soccer
squad by a disputed 2-1 margin, in
the second overtime period.

It was an offside call against Bill
Spofford that nullified his go-ahead
goal and sent the game into over-
time. What really handed insult to
injury was the fact that the referee
who initially called the infraction
later admitted the call was wrong
but could not change his mind.

The game began completely in
the Generals’ hands. A quick, aggres-
sive offense, controlled from the
wings, kept Dickinson on the de-
fense the entire first half. The total
number of shots taken by W&L
climbed near fifty. Junior co-cap-
tains Meade Kampfmuller, left wing,
and Brandon Herbert, half-back, led
the brigade.

Neither team scored until the sec-
ond half when sophomore Bill Spof-
ford laid a beautiful center from
Kampfmuller in the corner of the
goal, Dickinson did manage to move
against the half-backs on defense,
and they scored soon afterwards on
a penalty kick. Then came Spofford’s
disputed goal. Amidst continued ar-
guments, the referee admitted he
was wrong. Holding to the “Ref’s
Golden Rule”, he wouldn’t change
his initial call.

The first overtime saw little of-
fense, but it was evident the Gen-
erals were fired up. With only two
minutes remaining in the second

VMI Bounces
Ruggers, 14-0

A powerful, well-disciplined VMI
rugby squad took advantage of a
lack of leadership to whip the
Washington and Lee Rugby Club
14-0 last Saturday in a preseason
scrimmage.

Leadership and size, coupled with
the General's inexperience, were the
names of the game as the Coley
Roffo led Keydets displayed a merci-
less defense and a quick offense. The
Generals were definitely at a disad-
vantage even before the game had
begun, having had only four squad
practices beforehand and having lost
a few essential players to conflicting
outside activities.

VMI's size helped make their de-
fense impenetrable to any type of
offense the Generals could muster.
VMI stuck for four early tries and
one out of three extra points. A try
is equivalent to a touchdown in
football but is worth only three
points. The extra points are worth
two a piece. The scrimmage was not
played at full period time and it
last about one hour, Because of the
lack of any preparation the W&L
scoring machine continually bogged
down. Some of the members were
playing in their first rugby match
and were not familar with rules or
game conditions. Notable standouts

WA&L goalie Jim Kahn lunges in a futile attempt to stop a penalty
kick. The goal was Dickinson’s first as they went on to win 2-1 in
double overtime.

overtime, Dickinson managed their
winning goal on persistent net shots.
W&L did not give up as_ they
mounted a flurry of goal shots with
less than one minute to play. But
the clock was not generous enough
and Dickinson emerged the 2-1
victors.

Shouts of protesting the game
were heard immediately after, but
rules forbid the protest of a soccer
game. As any type of consolation,
the match was only a non-league
scrimmage.

Look for only good things to im-

merge from the soccer fields this
year. Standouts in this contest were
the goalie, Jim Kahn; right wing,
Mike Schaeffer; full-back, Rolf Pir-
anian; along with Spofford, Kampf-
mueller, and Brandon. The squad
fields five freshmen as starters, all of
whom have had previous soccer ex-
perience in high school. These young
hopefuls include John Embree,
Jimmy Fox, Gardner Britt, all line-
men, and backfield men Barclay
Armstrong and Chuck Alexander.

vious by looking back at public re-
action to major decisions in the past
twenty or so years, which has been
on the whole quite unfavorable. But
the Supreme Court cannot be con-
cerned with public opinion and its
primary victim: the politically con-
trolled segments of our government,
which include everything but the Su-
preme Court at most times. The nine
Justices must consider the good of
the country in the long run. If you
can lose your probably bloated sense +

we must face the somewhat ultimate
question of whether or not the Unit-

(Continued from page 2)
Lexington’s Registrar of Voters, not
allowing students to register to vote
unless they first file a declaration of
personal property with the Commis-
sioner of Revenue.

The rationale is this: City govern-
ment is largely, perhaps even pri-
marily, the matter of finances—how
to raise money (and how much), and
on what to spend it. A man or wom-
an whether a student or not, who
refuses to accept his or her full
share of the burden, including pro-
perty taxes, has neither the right nor
the business demanding a say-so in
how to use the money of those of
us who do accept that responsibility.

It seems to me that you are de-
manding—lI infer that you are de
manding, from your statement that
“the battle,” as you choose to call
it, remains to be won—it seems to
me that you are demanding that
Lexington extend the franchise to
students but exempt them from the
obligation that legally binds the rest
of us to declare our property (that is
to say: declare its eligibility to be
taxed), The result of that, of course,
would be to create two distinct
classes of citizens—those on the one
hand, students for instance, who
are granted representation but with
de facto immunity from taxation,
and, on the other hand, everybody
else,

If a student who can demonstrate
electoral eligibility in every other
respect wishes to vote in Lexington
—and surely every such student
should wish to vote here: after all,
students have to pay the local sales
tax and the city car-tag fee, and so
students already have a small vested
interest in the city’s management—
then that student, like every other
Lexington resident, must declare his
personal property (and pay his taxes
on it). It is as simple as that. And
once he does, once he vests as com-
plete an interest in this city’s man-
agement as the law requires of every
other bona fide resident, then the
Registrar of Voters must enroll him.
That, too, is as simple as that.

It would be a great challenge and
a great moment if Washington and

Slayton recounted his efforts at

Supt. Slayton indicated that over-
crowding; unsuitable design of the
interior of the prison; and the diffi-
culty of employing enough staff
members in view of budgetary con-
siderations all combined to create an
atmosphere of mere crisis solution
and custody rather than true re-
habilitation.

The questioning students bore
down heavily on the lack of criminal
procedure books in the prison li-
brary; the alleged inadequacy of the
administrative procedure by which
“good time” reduction decisions are
made; and the absolute necessity of
forcefully selling the concept of pri-
son reform to the general public.

One Vote Kills

The University Council, in its first
monthly meeting of the year Thurs-
day night, defeated a move to
abolish parietal regulations by a one-
vote margin. As a result, dormitory
sections in both the freshman and
upperclass dorms will proceed this
week to draw up visitation hours
within the established guidelines for
approval by the Student Control
Commitee.

The Council, a joint body of both
students and faculty, was chaired by
Student Body President Steve Robin-
son and University President R. E.
R. Huntley. First conceived last
year, the University Council serves
as a sounding board for recom-
mendations to the administration
and the student EC, and also serves
as the highest authority over student
affairs,

In other business Thursday, the
group approved the curriculum and
reviewed the actions of various fac-
ulty committees made since the last
session, discussed Professor Edward
Pinney’s proposal to abolish the
grade F, and discussed the feasibility
of merging the faculty and student
committees on Curriculum, Library,
and Admissions affairs.

The debate over parietals began
when Dr, Thomas Imeson, a repre-
sentative of both the Student Affairs
Committee (SAC) and the University
Council, outlined the changes ap-
proved by SAC in the area of
women’s visitation in university
housing. He pointed out that hours
were to be drawn up by each sec-
tion, having been defined with their
individual counselors, and that the
outside guidelines for weekend hours
had been extended to from 5 p.m.
Friday to Sunday midnight. Imeson
also announced that the Student
Affairs Committee had relinquished
the power of immediate review of
section parietal regulations to the
Student Control Committee, a body
entirely composed of students, as
opposed to the joint faculty and stu-
dent make-up of SAC.

Then sophomore Lewis Powell
asked, “Is it necessary to have a
rule if it won't be followed?” [meson
replied that there was an apprecia-
tion that violations did occur under
the parietal system last year, but
that it was up to the dormitory
counselors to see that it was up-
held. Powell countered that viola-
tions went on “with the knowledge
of the dorm counselors” and that it
was difficult for the university to
“legislate morality” among the stu-
dents,

Muskie

By RAY SWAN

Mr. and Mrs, Robert Squier,
media planning consultants for
Maine Senator Edmund Muskie,

spoke to a group of students in
Reid Hall last Monday afternoon.

Sponsored by the Washington and
Lee Mock Convention and the
Journalism Department, the Squiers
explained the process of projecting
a candidate's personality and plat-
form over the electronic media,
especially television.

“Our job,” said Mr, Squier, “is to
design a very effective and efficient
communication system.” According
to a Gallup poll, less than 9 per
cent of the electorate had personal
contact with any candidate at any
level. In spite of this, television has
“brought politics into the living
room,” said Mr, Squier.

Studen

There are signs that the state-wide

contreversy concerning college stu

dents registering in their campus
towns may affect the situation in
Lexington. In one instance, Bill
McLeod, a WAL junior and presi
dent of the University Republican
Club, has contacted the American
Civil Liberties Union and has

threatened to file suit “if need be to
protect my right to vote.”

McLeod attempted to register at
City Hall on Monday, and Mrs, Eva
Moore, City Registrar, who handles
this for Lexington
weording to McLeod, that she was

The factor of privacy was entered
into the discussion when Imeson
said he would expect hours to be
delineated within the guidelines to
insure “some time” within the week-
end for the privacy of others in the
dorm section. It was also pointed
out that peer pressure within the
sections would lead to each student
approving the most liberal hours,
“whether he really wanted these
hours or not.” Dean Lewis John
suggested one reason for the parietal
guidelines was perhaps to “protect
the minority of students aginst them-
selves.”

“Last year as a freshman,” Powell
countered, “I never found that my
privacy was impeded. In fact, when
girls stayed in the section, most of
the freshmen enjoyed it.” Senior Bob
Carrere agreed, saying that any in-
adjusted

convenience could be

 
 
 

. mm

among the residents themselves “just
as when a stereo is played too loud.”

The Council then overwhelmingly
passed a motion to reclaim authority
from SAC concerning _ parietals.
Dean Edward Atwood objected, say-
ing the University Council's action
had “put SAC into an almost im-
possible situation.” He emphasized
that the present parietals procedure
was drawn up by the Student
Affairs Committee last spring after
more than three weeks of varied
testimony and that it had received
“the almost unanimous acceptance
of both faculty and students on the
committee.”

Powell put his proposal to abolish
parietals altogether in the form of
a motion, and an amendment sug-
gested by Mr. Thomas Vinson was
attached, “that each dormitory unit
be required to produce some sort

of visitation hours for women or
instead declare that there are no
restrictive hours.”

Law School representative Charles
Hofheimer observed that “there
seems to be an almost even split,
with one or two exceptions, between
students who live under the system,
and the faculty and administrative
officials, who do not.”

Commented Steve Robinson, “I
personally think that having girls
in the dorm all week under un-
limited conditions is a distinct in-
vasion of privacy.” Dr. Marshall
Jarrett protested that it was “impos-
sible” to make a judgement without
the advantage of testimony which
SAC had heard.

“I hardly get my chair warm,”
said Dr. Edward L. Pinney, “and
find that we are emasculating the
late lamented SAC It seems

Mr. and Mrs. Robert Squier, Media Consultants for Maine Senator Edmund Muskie among others, appeared
for a presentation and press conference in Reid Hall Monday. This was a first of fall semester programs
sponsored by W&L’s Mock Convention,

Media Man Speaks Here

The Squiers decide how their
clients can best use the mass media
to project the desired image. They
begin by getting to know the candi-
date, personally getting to know his
family, personal background and
political philosophy. The Squiers do
not work for candidates they don't
personally support. They also will
not work with a candidate who has
no “media potential,” that is, one
who cannot present a good image
on television,

The Squiers stressed that because
television is relatively new, much re
search must be done in the field
of mass media image-building. They
are pioneers in media polling-inter
viewing the electorate during the
campaign to determine the effective
ness of promotional techniques

The Squiers have guided twenty

five campaigns in the three years
since they incorporated to form the
Communications Company of Wash
ington, DC,

In 1969, the firm advised Presi
dent Ferdinand Marcos of the
Philippines in his successful re-elec-
tion bid. In last year's election, the
company worked for eight different
candidates, including Governor Mar
vin Mandel of Maryland, Governor
Johv Burns of Hawaii, Congressman
John Brademas of Indiana and Sena-
tor Muskie. As a part of their work

Pinney protested that it was for
the Council to usurp SAC’s decision
on parietals, saying “I believe the
larger group is hardly ever able to
improve on the judgement of the
smaller group.”

After discussion ended, the motion
to remove parietal restrictions was
defeated, 11 to 10, All the student
representatives voted in favor, with
the exception of Robinson and
Marshall Washburn; the only faculty
member to vote for the motion was
Dr. David Elmes.

The Council then moved to return
responsibility to review parietals to
SAC, with the understanding that
SAC take into consideration the
sentiments expressed concerning the
current parietal structure.

In other business, Dr. Pinney sug-
gested that the grade of F be
abolished and that a student who
failed a course simply not be granted
credit for the course. He said grade
F was “academically undesirable”
because it “penalized” the student
for taking the course.

ove To Abolish Parietals

Elmes said that such an action
“could allow the student to mani-
pulate his Grade Point Average.
“This would decrease the sensibility
of the grading device used to de-
termine a student’s performance.”
Dean Atwood agreed, saying “I
don’t want to see a student who has
flunked ten courses getting a degree
from Washington and Lee; | think
it would degrade the degree.”

EC Announces Elections,
Limits Campaign Costs

Elections for freshman class
representatives to the University
Council and Executive Committee
and other class officers will be held
Monday, October 18. The E.C. an-
nounced this election date in its
Monday evening meeting.

In other business the committee
selected Fred Paone and Rudd Smith
as student representatives for the
Committee on Intercollegiate Athle-
tics, set a limit of $20 in election
expenses, and heard reports from the
standing committees.

The E.C. said that petitions are
being sought from freshmen candi-
dates for four positions: University
Council representative, E.C. Repre-
sentative, class president and class
vice president. Petitions are due
Monday, October 11. Petitions must
have 60 signatures; freshmen are
allowed to sign more than one peti-
tion. All candidates must submit
their petitions by 6:00 p.m. on the
eleventh to either Rick Gray at
the PiKA House or the E.C. box
in the Student Union.

Elections will be conducted by
Executive Committeemen on the fol-
lowing Monday, October 18. Run-
offs will fall on October 21, the fol
lowing Thursday.

In executive session the E.C. chose
two new members to the Commit-
tee on Intercollegiate Athletics: Fred
Paone and Rudd Smith. Paone is
a senior who plays varsity baseball,
Rudd Smith is a freshman in the
law school. He also serves as an
assistant football coach,

Student Body President Steve
Robinson initiated discussion of
limiting the number of posters that
appear on campus during election
campaigns.

Student Body Secretary Rick Gray
argued that, “the only way is
to limit how much is spent.”

Vice President Glenn Azuma com

only effective way to prevent this
is limiting the amount of money
spent.”

Gray said a limitation on the
amount a candidate could spend on
his campaign would “have them (the
candidates) come out on issues, not
to come out with names on posters.”
However, Gray did not think the
places that posters could be dis-
played should be limited. He argued
that posters “don’t do that much
damage to the grandeur of the
Colonnade.”

Senior Moon Yee stated that hav-
ing candidates “come out with a
platform is a good thing.” However,
Yee supported the idea of limiting
the placement of posters on campus.

Lock Handley, law representative,
moved that the amount of money
spent be limited in all elections, This
motion passed 6-2.

Senior Jo Jo Martin moved that
itemized lists of election expenses
be submitted to the E.C. by all
candidates. This motion passed 6-1
with one abstention.

Junior Archer Frierson moved
that a $20 ceiling be placed on all
upcoming freshman election cam-
paign expenses, with the under-
standing that this limit could be
altered later. This motion passed 6-2.

Immediately afterwards the presid
ing officer, Steve Robinson moved
that the E.C. pay for space in The
Ring-tum Phi which would allow
candidates to present their plat
forms. This motion also passed with-
out opposition.

| OUTLOOK and REVIEW

Wednesday, October 6, 1971

Dormitory parietals came within a single vote of being
eliminated Thursday night. The University Council, which
has authority over student affairs, voted down 11-10 Bob
Carrere’s proposal giving dormitory residents greater freedom
in determining visiting hours for women. The senior from
New Orleans began discussion of this issue last spring. This
year he called for a showdown at the council's first session.
oo. voting was interesting. Only two students voted
against the idea of discontinuing dormitory parietal limits
on “overnight visitation.” These gentlemen were President
of the Student Body, Steve Robinson, and M arshall Washburn.
A sole faculty member, Dr. D. G. Elmes, voted in favor of
Carrere’s proposal.

The effects of
Council are both encouraging and discouraging.

from the trio of individuals who were menti
representatives were split along student-faculty lines. |
\side from these sentiments, The Ring-tum Phi opposes
university limitations on female visitations for several reasons.
Among these reasons stated in an editorial last year in the
May 12 issue are:
1. “The parietals are on the books for appearance, not
enforcement,” i.e. the rules appease parents and alumni
who are not forced to endure these regulations.

quired to become unreasonable informers on
fellow students.

3. “Girls have stayed in the dorms, are staying in the

dorms and probably will continue to stay in the dorms.”

This means the parietals cannot be effectively enforced

as they now exist.

| Such rules contradict Washington and Lee Univer-

sity’s aspirations (according to its formal statement of

institutional philosophy) of “the importance of the
individual, his personal honor and integrity.”

Therefore, the existing parietals allow the W&L students
living in the dormitories only a limited ability to develop their
own integrity and honor. The Ring-tum Phi for these reasons
maintains that parietals should not be tolerated.

But opposition to such an abolition of parietals was voiced
hy students and administrators alike. First on the list of
defenses for parietals was the right of privacy. Steve Robinson
argues that having no guidelines for visiting hours would work
a hardship on some students. Simply taking a shower in
private would be a difficulty with girls present at any hour.
\lso manv W&L students have defended the unisex policies
of WK&L by claiming that girls are too distracting. With girls
running throughout the dorms at any hour the distraction
problem might become acute.

\nother argument, which might be raised by proponents
of parietals, is the unjust rule of a majority of students ov er
a minority. Currently, parietals are endorsed by a vote of
the individual dormitory sections, Theoretically, some indi-
viduals might object to completely open hours and = their
privacy would suffer due to a majority vote. Accordingly, the
limitations of the parietals give these individuals some relief
from the tyranny of the majority.

These arguments are legitimate. But they are fostered by
men who possibly overlook the rational capacities of W&L
men. If some members of the University Council envision
these difficulties, undoubtedly the dormitory dwellers will
envision them also. If these men living in university housing
fail to do so, or forget, at least dormitory counselors are there
to help them remember.

So, the two positions have been presented, The presenta-
tion was not exactly unbiased, but neither is the goal of this
editorial—to help eliminate parietals at W&l

discussion can be made, the opinions of W&L freshmen should
he made known. In the very least, the freshman class repre
sentative to the University Council should be heard, In addi
tion the dormitory counselors ought to determine the con
ensus of their outlooks on parietals. All these considerations
this issue is too important to be cast aside

WLUR Begins Fifth Year

By STEPHEN C, WOODRUFF

When I was asked to do a story
on WLUR-FM, I said “Sure,” never
imagining that it would be any dif-
ferent from any other story. I had
a lot to learn, Tracking down station
manager Bob Griffin was my first
problem; I finally found him where
I ought to have looked in the first
place, on the third floor of Reid
Hall, sometimes, although not al-
ways, recognizable as the offices and
studios of WLUR-FM, and in doing
so got a first hand taste of the be-
hind the scenes action that makes
WLUR-FM come out smoothly
(usually) on the air. Any good crea-
tive journalistic atmosphere is a
zoo—Edward Hannibal proves that
in selected portions of “Chocolate
Days, Popsical Weeks” — WLUR’s
offices certainly were Monday.

After waiting an hour and a half
of “be right with you” while Griff
hecticly tried to get things worked
out with a new programing schedule,
we finally took seats in the room

full of cluttered desks known as
“Operations” and talked about
WLUR, that is, between ringing

telephones, clacking teletypes in the
next room, and important interrup-
tions, amid the wall plastered with
posters, papers, and certificates, and
over the drone of Kirk Kirpatrick’s
voice as he pored over a computer
printout and made programing
changes.

This year WLUR plans to cele-
brate its fifth anniversary, on the
air, with as much of a collection
of the original staff as possible,
perhaps even recreating that first
night on the air, February 27, 1967.
At that time Fred C. Cole, then
acting president of the University,
made some remarks which to this
day underline the philosophy of
WLUR. “The purpose of our new
broadcasting station is to enrich the
life of the University and of Lex-
ington and Rockbridge county.”

But a lot of changes have taken
place since that first night on the
air. Originally WLUR’s musical fare
was limited strictly to classical. At
that time also, WLUR was on the
air approximately twenty hours a
week, compared with this fall's ten
or more hours per day. Until May
of 1968, the station played “rock”
music only before football and bas-
ketball games. A Ring-tum Phi edi-
torial at that time stated that students
were “more interested in listening
to Simon and Garfunkle than Bee-
thoven,” and “since the students
finance the station, the station should
cater to their wants with at least
one hour a day of rock ‘n roll
music.” More rock music began to
be aired by WLUR.

Special programs include Sherlock
Holmes, old radio drama, news spec-
ials, and FORUM. WLUR receices
special programs from distributors
for possible airing. Sitting in the
office now is one called “The Ameri-
can Indian.” Anybody want to hear
it? December 11 WLUR will be
again broadcasting the Metropolitan
Opera.

Today WLUR is known as “Lex-
ington's other radio station.” Griff
was happy to elaborate on that say-

Mock Convention Reply

To the Editor:

We will not stage the 1972 Mock
Convention because we do not be
lieve WAL students are puppets. The
various chairmen and delegates will
be doing research into state politics
and delegate selection reforms. The
final result will be the expression of
several hundred students’ efforts. It
will be an opportunity to learn how
our country will govern itself. We
do not think that WAL students
are interested in building a slot-
machine replica of a corrupt society,
but we expect that as the inheritors
of an imperfect society they are
curious to know where this society
is heading. We will need this pos
sibly frightening knowledge is we
seek to change our world and hope
to succed at it

We would take with the
historical references made in the
column last week. We do not con
sider that this country
splendidly democratic in its early
years when private property was a
requirement for voting. We do not
think that all the performances of

ing, “The whole idea of WLUR is
to provide an alternative to the
radio listener. You could go all the
way across the country just pushing
the buttons on your radio and you'd
always hear the same thing. The
voices would change, but that’s
about it. We program music and
programs which commercial stations
cannot or will not.”

Bob went on to stress “WLUR
has something for everybody. We're
a service station, a listener’s station,
If somebody would like to hear
something, all they have to do is
let us know and we'll try to give it
to them, whether it’s a certain type
of music or a special on VD in
Rockbridge county.” WLUR _ is
classified as “educational” radio, and
Griff says that’s what they are;

“WLUR provides the people of this
area with information—news, sports,
public interest programs, discussions
of current problems.”

Currently WLUR'’s
contains a large dose of public
affairs — FORUM, a WLUR pro-
duction, discusses current issues of
interest—a wide range of music—
country-western, jazz and blues, big
bands, gospel, underground rock
(Ghunga’s Revenge), classics, soul,
and top forty rock (The Mighty
Moog)—and complete coverage of
news and sports. WLUR’s “Home
Edition” is the only source of daily
news in Rockbridge county, As all
of you avid radio listeners know,
WREL also pitches in and carries
WLUR’s production of “Home Edi-
tion.”

programing

 

January is the target date for
WLUR to become an even larger
news center than it now is. At that
time WLUR is to begin acting as
a clearing house for Associated Press
Voice transmissions for the state of
Virginia. For example, if a Rich-
mond station has a tape of Governor
Holton making some newsworthy
comments, they send it to WLUR,
WLUR informs all the other stations
in the state that they have it. If
one of them wants to use it, they
call WLUR, and get hooked up to
the tape. It is a subscription service
of A.P. which WLUR gets to use
free for its service.

WLUR has an

so large and spread out it’s hard to

“We always have some attrition

Ever since the passage of the
twenty-sixth amendment, granting
the franchise to all those over the
age of eighteen, it has become virtu-
ally axiomatic to urge the newly
entitled to register. However, the
recent action of Federal Judge
Robert Merhig ordering the regis-
tration lists, originally scheduled to
be closed last Friday, to be held
open for one additional week, makes
it all the more imperative for Wash-
ington and Lee students who are, as
yet, unregistered to attempt to
register here in Lexington.

There are problems with this, The
City, for all its fine words, has
done its best to discourage students
from exercizing their franchise, and
it accordingly requires some di-
plomacy and discretion to fight
through the bureaucratic red tape
and convince the County Registrar
(who is, incidentally, located in the
County Courthouse on the corner
of Washington and Main), that one
is a decent, deserving citizen.

Important elections are to be held
here in Virginia this November.
Both houses of the State Legislature
are up for election, and, most im-
portant of all, a Lieutenant Gov-
ernor is being selected to fill the
remaining term of the late J. Sargent
Reynolds. These races are, perhaps,
of merely academic interest to those

from outside Virginia, yet they are
reflections of a popular sentiment
shown by all residing here: if you,
as a student, have any concern for
this state, then by all means speak
up and show your feelings by taking
the time and interest to register and
vote.

It is often said that the student
vote is of little import, for it is
watered down by the ballots of the
native populace. Yet, there is so
much more to politics than merely
the casting of votes! Student political
groups, where well-organized and
well-run, have had a_ considerable
impact on the political constitution
of a locality; here at W&L, the Uni-
versity Republicans, for example,
have been a significant factor in the
shift of Rockbridge County from a
one-party to a two-party area which
now has not only a Republican
State Senator but, in addition, a Re-
publican Congressman. The Young
Democrats, for many years mori-
bund, have been resuscitated and
may—with student support—play as
important a role in local politics as
has their sister club. Each candi-
date, in addition, can well use any
help that you—as individuals—are
able to tender.

One of the local candidates for
the House of Delegates has pointed
out the discrepancy between the per-
centage of lawyers in the General
Assembly — 67% — and the much
lower percentage among the general
populace. While it is important that
only those who understand the com-
plexities of the law be authorized
by the electorate to amend and frame
legislation, still there is tremendous
room here for some form of broad-
ening the power base through which
we are ruled,

Utilize your right, or else it shall
through apathy, atrophy and dis-
appear, and then—when you have
deservedly been penalized for your
unthinking sloth—none shall be-
moan the iniquities of your fate as
much as you!

As the dealine for submitting fra-
ternity preferences draws near, many
freshmen who have participated in
Rush have been dragged through a
multitude of pro-fraternity informa-
tion and are now wondering as to
whether there even exists an al-
ternative to joining a fraternity at
Washington and Lee. Socially, athle-
tically, and financially, they compare
fraternity life to that of independ-
ence without actually being able to
explore the independent aspects of
living at W&L.

and more of an important role at
WA&L. According to Dean of Stu-
dents Lewis G. John, the trend to
day is definitely towards independent
life. “Ten years ago, 85 per cent
of the students were associated with
fraternities,” Dean John said. “The
percentage is steadily dropping.
Freshmen are finding more and
more alternatives to fraternities.”
The University has aided in pro-
moting independent life at W&L for
students who cannot, mainly for

Generals Fall to Colonels 17-7

With All Scoring in First Half

By LEWIS HIXSON

The Washington and Lee Generals
dropped a 17-7 decision to Centre
College here Saturday with all the
scoring coming in the first half.
The score did not really indicate the
type of game that took place as
WAL gathered more total yardage
(260 compared to 212) and made
several drives into Colonel territory
during the second half.

Centre won the toss to start the
game and elected to kick, defending
the south goal. John Loising took
the kickoff on his own 8 and re-
turned it 18 yards to the W&L 26.
Steve Fluharty then guided the Blue
team down the field mixing two
pass plays to Conrad and Baldwin
with runs by himself, Jim Farrar
and Jo Jo Martin. With 8:12 re-
maining in the first quarter Fluharty
followed a block by Farrar to score
from one yard out, Fluharty had
guided the Blue offense 74 yards in
14 plays to put the Generals ahead
by a 7-0 margin following the point
after by Doug Chase.

The folllowing kickoff was re-
covered by Centre on its own 47
after an attempted onside kick by
the Generals failed. A personal foul

penalty for piling on moved the ball
into good field position for the
Colonels—the W&L 38. It looked
like the visitors were going to
follow suit as Harry Sykes moved
his team to first and ten at the
WA&L 13. It was then that the Blue
defense went to work and held the
Colonels to nine yards on four
plays to regain the football.

The General offense was held to
six yards in three plays reaching
only their nine yard line and Chappy
Conrad was called on to punt it
away from his own end zone. He
did a beautiful job, punting the ball
49 yards to the Centre 42 where it
was downed by Bill Baldwin.

Centre then moved to the W&L
33 where on first down Steve Camp-
bell swept right end for the 33 yards
and the score. The extra point was
good and it was 7-7 with 13:24
left in the half. W&L received the
kickoff and moved to its own 43
before the Colonel defense stiffened
and the Generals were forced to
punt. Greg Ely received Conrad's
punt on his own 13 and almost
broke loose returning the football to
his own 43 before being tripped up
by John Newman.

Centre and W&L then exhanged
punts when neither team was able to
move, with the Colonels getting the
better end of it and achieving good
field position on the W&L 33. Sykes
and Ely then combined efforts to
move in for a touchdown with 3:50
remaining in the half. The PAT was
good and the Colonels held a 14-7
lead.

W&L’s Loesing returned the kick-
off 19 yards to his own 27. On the
first play from scrimmage Fluharty
fumbled after a eight yard gain and
Leising covered it for Centre on the
Blue 38. The colonels moved to the
General 25 where on third down
Dave Brooks broke up a pass from
Sykes to MacQuarles. This brought
on Tom Bennett to attempt a field
goal. The kick was good from 35
yards out and with 29 seconds left
in the half, Centre had jumped out
to a 17-7 lead. The Generals were

Ruggers Drop Opener 23-0

Washington and Lee’s Rugby
Club started this season the same as
they did the last, dropping the
opener to the always tough Virginia
Tech, 23-0, Sunday on Alumni Field.

Although the final score indicates
a lashing at the hands of quick, well-
organized Tech, the W&L men were
not so much outplayed as they were
outlasted in the grueling hour of
no substitution, no time out play.

At the half Tech held a narrow one *
try lead, 4-0. Washington and Lee °

had gotten the ball moving around
in the backfield for a couple of long
runs but failed to get the ball over
either time.

But in the second half, W&L’s in-
experience and lack of practice
showed up, and Tech scored two
more quick tries and got one of the
kicks for two extra points. Later
in the game Tech scored three more
points on a penalty kick and then
put the lid on things with another
try and kick after. Tech’s standout
back, scored three of Tech’s four
tries, as the W&L ruggers simply
weren't able to hold him down.

Putting in noteworthy perform-
ances for the home club were full-
back Fred Fletcher, who often kick-
ed the ball safely downfield in the
face of a maddening rush, and
Tom Barton, who defensively allow-
ed nothing to get past him, (caus-
ing his Tech counterpart to spend
most of the game on the ground).

The W&L ruggers faired slightly
better in the “B” game, aided by
several Tech rookies, as the Blue
fell a few men short of making up
a second team while Tech boasted
bodies to spare. The “B” team fell
20-14, on Tech's five trys, while
W&L picked up two from a Tech
wing back, one from their own Carl
Cassidy, and two points on a suc-

Alternatives

(Continued from page 3)
financial reasons, join a fraternity.
The relaxation of university regula-
tions in recent years, on subjects
such as automobiles, dormitory
drinking, and entertaining girls in
dormitory rooms, has, in essence,
attempted to make domitory social
life equal that of a fraternity. Also,
the establishment of the Student
Center has helped to bring inde-
pendents social equity with fraterni-
ties through the sponsoring of
dances, mixers, and the like.

Athletically, the Independent
Union handles an extensive intra-
mural program for those students
not affiliated with fraternities, Any
independent who has an interest in
the intramural program may partici-
pate through the Independent Union
for a small fee used to cover the
University’s intramural fees.

Financially, students generally find
independent life somewhat less ex-
pensive than that of fraternity liv-
ing, especially in his freshman year,
since all fraternity assessments then
are in addition to the normal uni-
versity expenses. In the freshman
year, pledge and _ initiation fees
usually make up a fairly large
amount of this assessment. In addi-
tion, monthly social expenses, which
may exceed what a student would
plan to spend socially whether he
joined a fraternity or not, are also
tacked on to these assessments.

As an upperclassman, the financial
comparison is complicated by the
problem of independent housing at
Washington and Lee, At the present
time, fraternal life shows a major
advantage here, at least for the
sophomore year, when fraternity
members generally reside in the
houses.

There is presently a distinct on-
campus housing problem at W&L.
Approximately 75 room openings
are available in the upper-class
dormitories, University officials and
student advisors will soon begin
planning for construction of new
upperclass dormitories which, ac-
cording to Dean John, “could be
opened by September, 1973.” How-
ever, judging from the experience of
Washington and Lee with construc-
tion work at the present time, the
tentative date of Fall, 1973, would
probably be extended into the school
year of 1973-74, so that 1974 would
be about the most realistic date for
the full use of these proposed dormi-
tories.

Here, then, fraternity life pre-
sents a distinct advantage for up-
perclassmen, particularly sopho-
mores. However, the folding of sev-
eral fraternities in recent years has
offset this security, of having a
place to live, with its own insecurity,
of perhaps encountering the financial
woes of a highly unstable fraternity.
Again, even with the shortage of
on-campus housing, independents
may reside in apartments, of which
there is a fairly adequate number
in Lexington. These apartments may
be rented normally for prices com-
parable to that of a dormitory or
fraternity room.

Elsewhere financially for upper-
classmen independents, board is at
least on par with if not usually less

SECS SS

expensive than that of a fraternity.
Social expenses are an added assess-
ment in fraternities, and they may or
may not exceed what the student
may plan to spend socially, Also,
added expenses must be accounted
for in fraternity life, such as those
for house upkeep.

Another question in the minds of
freshmen is whether association with
a fraternity is an advantage to run-
ning for an office in a campus
organization. “To the extent that fra-
ternities encourage their members to
join organizations, I think this is
true,” states Dean John. “It de-
pends on the individual. Being in
a fraternity is no longer the prere-
quisite for high campus office that
it once was.” In general, the election
of a student to a campus office,
then, relies more upon his individual
personality than upon his fraternity
association.

There is, then, a strong alterna-
tive to fraternity life at Washington
and Lee. More and more students
are shunning fraternal association
for the life of an independent. There
are advantages to both fraternity
and independent life, and the choice
must be made by the student as to
what to do. He must come to a
decision, through presentations by
both sides and through his own
observations, as to whether to join
a fraternity or not, and above all,
the decision must be his own.

Re: Mock Convention

(Continued from page 2)
was a major antecendent of the dis-
cretion of the chief executive and
Jefferson did not even seek anything
like a Tonkin Gulf Resolution to
make it.

We share the apprehension about
perpetuating some elements of the
established order. Like “law and
order,” “working within the system”
has become a code phrase. To many
it connotes repressive tolerance.
Even with that in mind, it should be
noticed that the Democratic Party
has been attempting to reform it-
self since 1968. Sen. George Mc-
Govern, a man well-known to this
campus, and Rep. Donald Fraser, a
former chairman of the Democratic
Study Group, headed one and Rep.
James O'Hara, a progressive Michi-
gan Democrat, headed the other, It
could be that the work of these
groups will insure that the next
Democratic Convention will be dif-
ferent from and better than Chicago.

Nicholas von Hoffman, a writer
not known for his kind regard for
national politicians of any stripe,
has commented that the next Demo-
cratic nominee would probably be
chosen by a more truly democratic
process than our generation has
seen, That, in his opinion, made the
Democratic nomination worth pursu-
ing in 1972. It could be that the
process has something to offer us
yet. None of us can know unless
we try it. If we reject it out of
hand, we abdicate our right to make
our own history.

Soccer

It was one of those games when
you wish the outcome was decided
by which team played the best
last Tuesday as the Washington and
Lee soccer team lost to Eastern
Mennonite, 4-2. The Generals out-
played, outhustled, and outfought
Eastern Mennonite, but when the
final whitle blew, the Blue was be-
hind in what really counts — the
score.

Except for the first eight minutes
when Eastern Mennonite scored four
goals, the Generals were in com-
mand all the way. Freshman Jimmy
Fox provided both of W&L’s goals,
as the Blue squad outshot their op-
ponents 22 to 10. Jim Kahn started
at goalie for the Generals but was
replaced by Paul Devine, who held
the opposition scoreless.

On Friday the team travelled to
Madison for a game, but found the
field under too much water to play.
Madison officials were reluctant to
have their new field torn up, so the
game has been rescheduled for
October 11, weather permitting. The
Generals also have another game
today at Lynchburg College. Satur-
day the booters will face Old
Dominion.

Although there was no scoring in

Blue defense held the Colonels to
only 46 yards total offense and three
first downs in the last half, The
Blue offense collected nine first
downs and 156 total yards but were
unable to put it together for a score.
The General defense appears to
be greatly improved over last year
on the basis of these first two games.
The offense has shown that it can
move the football. With a little more
experience the team will develop
into a well operating unit. Conrad
and Baldwin have proved that they
are capable receivers and Fluharty

ting on 14 of 21 attempted passes.

say just how many people work on
the station.” Journalism classes do
writing for the station, thirty people
do news, about thirty more do air
work, and there are two staffs of
ten to twenty people each that do
special programs. Of course, there is
some overlap. There is a core of
about ten people who are the heart
of the station and keep everybody
else in line; among these are Griff,
of course, Chet Burgess, Chief Engi-
neer, Jay Denny, Program Director,
Tom Rowe, News Director, Kirk
Kirkpatrick, Operations Director,
and Prof. R. H. MacDonald, Gen-
eral Manager, affectionately known
by the staff as “Boss.”

WLUR hasn't had any trouble
finding bodies (maybe the athletic
department should come to them);
Griff put it this way, “We don't
have any trouble finding people to
push buttons over there (in the
control room). Pushing buttons is
fun, but there is a lot of work be-
hind it.” After being in that office,

You have to do all the work first.”

Wayne Baker can tell you how
much work there is to do over
there. In his early days with the
station, he came over to do the five
o'clock news, and got stuck with the
six as well, and then the 7:15 busi-
ness report and reading the editorial.
That included going through all the
information off the teletype and the
whole days list of stock quotations,
when, as he said, he “hardly knew
anything about it.”

Bob Ford, who does a jazz blues
show on WLUR, summed it all up
when he said, “WLUR is all other
radio stations rolled into one; it
brings you everything you could ask

One Vote Kills Move To Abolish Parietal Control

(Continued from page 1)

“Twenty-five years ago,” said
President Huntley, “many thought
it wrong to allow students to stay
for more than four years until
they accumulated enough credits,”
Discussion was tabled until the next
session.

In the final topic of the evening,
it was recommended by representa-
tives of the various student commit-
tees of the EC that the advisory
bodies be merged with their parent
faculty committee. “There is a
considerable beauracracy involved,
which is no one’s fault,” said Roger
Munsick, chairman of the Curri-
culum Committee. “It would be bet-
ter to have people on the spot to

offenders.”

Lee said, “one problem is that
people are slow to show up for
meetings concerning fines for bad
checks picked up and honored by
the committee.”

Lock Handley asked Chuck Lee
how many of the offenders were law
students. Lee reported that last year
only three or less of the total 250
offenders were law students, Lee
went on to say about $2,000 in bad
checks were honored by the commit-
tee last year.

“Some people feel the school
should not have responsibilities over
their financial matters,” Lee con-
tinued.

The E.C. took no action regard-
ing the Student Financial Relations
Committee but did make recom-
mendations. It was recommended by
E.C. members that fines might be
raised and that notification of bad
check hearings be sent through the
office of the Dean of Students.

Larry Evans submitted the Stu-
dent Recruitment Committee report.
Evans told the E.C. that some com-
mitteemen had already made a re-
cruiting trip to Martinsville, Virginia
this year. He claimed that seven

make decisions, to say yes or no,”
The consensus seemed to conclude
that student committees would have
to be reduced before any such
merger, and that students could not
be included on any matters except
general policy on the Admissions
and Financial Aid Committees,
“Arriving at a workable number
for commitee representation would
be the big point of contention,” said
Dean of Admissions James Farrar.
Dean Atwood suggested that per-
haps “it could work both ways” so
that instead, faculty members could
sit on student committees to provide
the necessary liaison. Discussion on
this matter will also be continued
during the session next month,

additional recruiting trips were plan-
ned before November.

Larry summarized the two-fold
goal of his group as “recruiting un-
deprivileged students and
securing funds for their support.”

The University Center-Orientation
Committee report came from chair-
man Stan Harris. Harris said the
University Center had held two
dances at a loss of about $100. A
film company has agreed to supply
the University with movies for 50c
commission of a 75c admission
charge. The first film is “American
Dream,” scheduled to be shown in
mid-October.

Steve Robinson voiced a complaint
about the service in the University
tavern, the Cockpit. Robinson stated
that the people who work in the
Cockpit “are as slow as molasses
when it comes to service.” Harris
promised to investigate,

Steve Greene turned in the Stu-
dent Control Committee report.
Only organizational meetings have
been held so far, No cases have
come before the committee to date.

Library Committee Chairman Bill
West sent his report. The student
committee has voted to merge with
the Faculty Library Committee.
Steve Robinson explained that such
a merger might be wise since the
two duplicate each other, and each
serves only in an advisory capacity.

Lyles, Steven Mehaffey.

In other action the EC decided to
procure the removal of the identifi-
cation machines recently placed in
the Evans Dining Hall. Student Body
President Steve Robinson presented
for consideration a petition, initiat-
ed by senior Gary Sprunk, which
bore 57 names calling for the re-
moval of the card-punch system.

Robinson said that the manager
of W&L’s Dining facility, Jerry

Darrell, had indicated that it was
possible that the machines be phased

out. Darrell said that the ARA-Sla-
ter Food system, with which the
WAL facility is contracted, requires

identification cards for any school
serving more than 500 meals. But, it
was pointed out, the University in-
volved could reject the machines if
they had reason to do so,

“I think there’s a valid point on
honor to be made here,” said Law
representative Lock Handley. “There
needs to be instances on display to
show where the honor system works
—it seems to me the Dining Hall
would be happy to go along with it.”

Robinson said that many students
who are not contracted with, but
who eat often in, the Dining Hall,

W&L Students Tutoring

Ihe program through which W&L
students volunteer to serve as tutors
in the Lexington schools will be get-
ting under way this week. Students
who offer their services are assigned
to assist regular teachers at either
the local elementary or the junior
high schools, usually for one hour,
twice a week,

At present the program could use
20-25 more volunteers to complete
the current schedule. Anyone inter
ested should see one of the two liai-
son directors on the W&L faculty:
Dr. George Ray in Payne 32B or
Dr. Thomas Imeson in Howe 313.

Dr. Ray explained that the work
involves helping a regular teacher,
either at the Waddell Elementary
School or the Lylburn-Downing
School (grades 5, 6 and 7) at some
period during regular school hours,
8:30 am. to 3:00 p.m. The needs
seem to be primarily in mathematics,
science, English, social studies, and
special education.

Ray added that the volunteer help
may involve, if desired, more than
academic aid, perhaps by taking on

“big brother” function outside of
class for underprivileged children
who for some reason need special at-
tention and companionship.

“The student volunteer may be
used more imaginatively by the
teacher,” said Ray. “He may con

ceivably help with the entire class or,
as is usually the case, work with in-
dividual pupils on a one to one
basis.”

The program was begun two years
ago under the aegis of the PTA. It
has been enthusiastically received by
the local principals, and the teachers
themselves have expressed apprecia-
tion for the invaluable help given by
the W&L students who have worked
with them in the past. With recent
budget cuts, the schools are finding
an increasing need for volunteer aid
to help maintain the quality of the
schools,

“By and large, the students have
been doing it because they really
feel the need; they realize its some-
thing beneficial, not just eyewash,
but a real help,” Ray remarked.

It was emphasized that the pro-
gram can use as much or as little
time as a student feels he can af-
ford. In fact, there have been several
spin-offs from this program in the
past years, which sometimes have re-
sulted in academic credit.

Bruce Ritz, a W&l junior
from Lexington, has undertaken a
related project under the auspices of
a Robert E. Lee Research Grant.
He will explore the individual modes
of instruction in the elementary
classroom.

Senior David Raine taught poetry

“very successfully” to a sixth grade
English class during the spring se-
mester, in an accredited project with
a R. E. Lee Grant-in-Aid. He work-
ed up a proposal whereby 40-50 stu-
dents might be involved in a similar
effort.

“This program has helped to
break down some of the community
prejudices, and the local teachers
have been very happy to receive this
help,” Ray concluded. “But the stu-
dents are not in it for their image,
they’re in it because they want to

. and because they want to see the
quality of the system improved.”

After discussion the EC passed
Glen Azuma’s motion, accepting
Sprunk’s petition and calling for the
removal of the identification ma-

emphasized that the Honor System
does indeed apply to the Dining
Hall, and that those who fail to pay
are risking an honor violation.

Lastly, the EC discussed what sort
of limitations should be instituted on
student election campaigns. After
restricting freshmen to $20 per can-

EC debated whether or not a cost
limit was the correct course,

Russ Fletcher said that the spend-

any EC action regarding future elec-

Robinson, “is to force candidates to

difficult to police any such restric-

War Research Is Possible,
According To Karl Deutsch

portance in today’s world to that of
a “study of infection in the age of
the Black Death.” The Czechoslo-
vakian-born professor developed his
topic in five steps: a definition of
war, a study of recent war history,
a comparison of limited war to all-
out war, a discussion of the causes
of war, and the presentation of pos-
sible deterrents to war in the future.

In defining war itself, Professor
Deutsch suggested four criteria. He
implied that battle deaths are overt
the level of 1000 men in a war, as
compared to a skirmish, incident, or
the like. He also theorized that “war
is prepared for in advance,” citing
growing defense budgets, military
training, and weapons build-up as
prerequisites to a war,

The guest lecturer noted,
wars are legitimized by the state,”
as a third defining quality. “They
(the citizens of a country) are being
aught that someday their govern
ment may call on them to fight
The nations, then, teach their citi
zens to accept war. As a final requis
ite to war, Professor Deutsch noted
the institutionalization of war in a
country. “Men spend their lives pre
paring for war; wars are a part of
the normal life of nations.” He cited

also

Macbeth’

armies, navies and military budgets
as some of the many institutions of
war.

The speaker then gave a_ brief
study of recent war history, particul-
arly the period from 1816-1955. He
noted the occurence of 100 wars in
that period of time, at the rate of

one every 18 months. “On the
whole,” he said, “usually less than
three per cent of the countries of

the world are at war at one time.”
He pointed out that for a specific
country, war usually follows a rhy-
thm of 15-20 years, because the
effect of a recent war tends to pro-
mote peace in the country’s mind
for such a period. However, he cau
tioned that “you still can by all
means have wars in off-peak years.”

Dr, Duetsch also noted the growth
of war in recent history, attributing
this growth to greater and more
complex alliances and to an increase
in war's “deadlines”. He
gested that wars may be
vastating than statistics imply, as
seen in the fact that, though there
8.000.000 battle or direct
deaths in World War Il, there were
also approximately 42,000,000 more

OUTLOOK ani REVIEW

October 13, 1971

Alumni Questions, Answers

Last weekend Washington and Lee University sponsored
an alumni conference. The event was characterized by lunches,
banquets, cocktail parties, speeches, and some very serious
discussion.

About 60 alumni attended the three-day program. Many
represented the various alumni chapters across the nation,
Others participated in the affairs because they were invited
class agents. And still other alumni appeared simply because
they were concerned.

The entourage had widely dispersed origins. Some alumni
journeyed from as far as Los Angeles; others lived right here
in Lexington. The oldest W&L man to appear was Will H.

sarrett, class of 1921. At the opposite end of the spectrum was
Matt Cole, a June graduate, and the most recently departed
alumnus to attend.

Twenty-seven faculty members, students, and administra-
tors fielded questions from the alumni. Those questions touch-
ed on almost all aspects of the operation of Washington and
Lee University. The alumni were especially interested in stu-
dent life on campus. Some of their key questions were:

Are fraternities dying?

What are students interested in?

What is the admissions picture?

Is student activism a problem ?

How bad a drug problem exists at W&L?

What has happened to conventional dress? Here are the an-
swers:

The alumni were told that fraternities do have a place at
Washington and Lee. Fraternity membership has declined in
recent years; three houses have gone out of business. Inter-
fraternity Council President Rob LaRue hypothesized that fra-
ternity membership would level off at about 50% of the stu-
dent body.

Concerning what are the interests of today’s students, the
alumni received a general answer to their question, According
to Dean William Schildt, W&L men are expressing growing
interest in creative fields. Over half of the undergraduates are
exposed to the arts, music, or drama through courses or extra-
curricular activities.

Dean of Admissions James Farrar shed light on the ad-
missions situation for the benefit of the alumni. He said 350
freshmen were accepted for the present freshman class out of
1260 applicants. The number of applicants was up from about
1250 last year. Farrar compared this increase of applicants
with as much as a 20% decrease in private eastern colleges,
especially the Ivy League. Dean Farrar felt more men wanted
to attend W&L because the school “continued to be a superior
institution.”

Student activism is not very evident this year the student
representatives explained, Only a few radicals were openly ad-
mitted to be attending W&L. Steve Robinson, President of
the Student Body, concluded that “the student body is basic
ally conservative, more liberal than in the past, yet still con-
servative.”

The alumni were informed by students and administrators
that drugs were not a insurmountable problem at W&L. The
use of hard drugs was thought to be extremely rare, but all
the students concurred that a majority of their peers had tried
marijuana. Also the school’s tripartite approach of counseling,
educating and punishing drug users was explained in detail to
certain alumni,

One of the major problems in the eyes of the alumni is the
recent decline of conventional dress i.e. coat and tie. Students
justified their rejection of conventional dress for a pair of
reasons, First, it was argued that dress is an individual thing
and should not be enforced by others. Second, students con-
tended that the tradition was not vital to maintaining the
spirit of Washington and Lee. They said the coat and tie ap-
pearance was only a superficial aspect of what WAL. truly
stands for.

\ final concern of W&L alumni was the recruitment of
blacks. Dean Farrar related te the W&L graduates the Admis
sions Office's six year effort to interest blacks in attending
our institution, The actions of the Student Recruitment Com
mittee were cited in this effort,

The questions and incomplete answers presented here have
a direct effect on you and your brief stay in Lexington, The
We&L graduates usually contribute a significant portion of the
total cost of every student's education at Washington and Lee
through alumni donations, These contributions allow the uni
versity to operate. Therefore, the alumni have a vital interest
in protecting their investment, W&L.

The Rockbridge Area Problem
Center, located at 323 North Main
Street in Lexington, is slated to open
on October 30. Legally known as
the Lexington Crisis Center, Inc., it
is a non-profit corporation staffed by
trained volunteers and designed to
serve three basic functions: 1) to
provide immediate aid and comfort
to those people faced with a prob-
lem situation; 2) to supply available
information and 3) to refer those in
need to already. established sources
of aid.

Following a name contest open to

all local residents last summer, the
core committee of the center chose
“REACH-OUT” as an_ unofficial
name. The center will be open 24
hours a-day, seven days a week, and
all its services are free. It is designed
for the use of the entire community,
and it will seek the support of the
community as a whole, It is empha-
sized that REACH-OUT is not sim-
ply a drug center, but will handle
all types of problems in all areas.
Immediate aid will be given over
the phone or in person to deal with
problems like drug emergencies,

runaways, personal hang-ups or
other crises of a less serious nature,
Volunteers will be prepared to ex-
plore objectively with a person the
possible consequences and alterna-
tives of a problem or an impending
decision.

The center will supply factual in-
formation about public agencies al-
ready serving the surrounding area
and about social problems like alco-

Admission Policies Reflect
State Of Today’s Economy

BY ANDY SIMPSON
“Although the University is locat-
ed in the South. its student body rep-
resents broad geographic. social, and
economic cross sections of the na-
tion . . . The University seeks stu-
dents without regard to race of re-
higion and strives to achieve econo-
mie and sdcial diversity among its
students . . . Economic backgrounds
of students vary widely, and the
University is able to give financial
assistance to all studenis with need.”
The Washington and Lee Board
of Admissions, the Department of
Finaneial Aid, and the Student Re-
cruitment Committee are concerned
with the above policies as stated in
the 1971-72 BULLETIN. Their task
in trying to fulfill these objectives
for the good of the University is
considerable and, in the words of
James Farrar, Dean of Admis<ions,
is a perpetual battle. Still, though.
these victories gained in this Pattle
are important enough to rule out
any withdrawal of troops, That is.
the University has no intention of
giving up the fight.

Statistics, although sometimes mis-
leading, can tell part of the story.
For instance, geographical distribs-
tion in the freshman class includes
representation of 34 states, D. C..
and one foreign country. Last year.
42 states, D.C.. two US. territories,
and seven foreign countries were
represented. In this respect, WAL is.
for a school of its size, among the
top in the nation.

Yet, as Dean Farrar sees if. “geo
graphic diversity probably means
less than it did years ago. say in
1920. Everyone drives the same hind
of cars, drinks the same Cokes, end
wears Levi's, There are no ten
gallon hats to distinguish the Texan
from ‘the Massachusetts student.
There is very little regionalism, as
such.” However, social and econc-
mic diversity are becoming increas
ingly important and it is in the pro
cess of striving for these two goals
that admissions people confront their
toughest foes.

“You recognize the importance of
this social and economic diversity
but your funds have to grow to
make it possible.” Dean Farrar
notes, ft is in this area of increas
ing funds that the biggest headaches
are realized. Funds, or the lack of
them, is the biggest, single barrier to
increased economic and social di
versity at WAL. Por that reason the
Student Recruitment Committee. un
der President James Davis, consid
ers fund-raising as its number one
priority the year. The S.R¢

from the Calder Foundation of New
York last year and, although erate

The University, through its own
funds and those available
federal programs

lhrotigh

provides tehitly

more than $500,000 dollars in finan-
cial aid. This figure includes granis,
loans, and scholarships for 23-24%
of the student body which is a slight
but definite drop of one to two per-
centage points from the percent
aided in previous years.

Rising costs and the burden of
previous commitments to returning
upperclassmen on financial aid make
it impossible for the University to
now guarantee “assistance to all stu-
dents with need.” This condition
greatly affects the behavior of the
S.R.C. as its concern is the recrvit-
ment of students, with emphasis on
those who would be considered un-
derprivileged. In its recruitment of
underprivileged students, the Com-
mittee has to be careful not to over-
sell the University. That is. they
have to impress upon the student
that the University wants them and
that they should apply, but that
there can be no guarantee of finan-
cial aid.

Any recruitment of applicants to
day contends with the competitive-
ness of low tuition ai state schools:
a present preference for larger. more
urban schools; and the trend toward
co-education, For these and various
personal considerations, applicants
may turn down offers from Wash-
ington and Lee. Thus to attract can
didates WAL has to have something
to offer and has to let it be known.

“You still have to let all the public
know that WAL exists and offers ex-
cellent programs—you have to let
all strong students regardless of
background learn about WAL.”
Dean Farrar believes that the Uni
versity that fails to do this will find
itself dependent solely upon that se-
lect group which can afford the ex-
pense of a private education. With
limited diversity such as that. the
prospects for a quality education are
also limited,

In its recruitment ef underprivil-

eged students and those applicants
without financial need, admissions
people “do not aim for tokenism.”
assures Jim Davis, President of the
S.R.C, “Te do so,” he contends
would be detrimental to both the
school and the student.” The results
of successful recruitment of quali
lied students are “an enrichment of
life here at W&L,” as well as the
opportunity for a quality education
on the part of the student. To assure
these benefits, “we have to be care
ful not to lower standards by accept
ing unqualified underprivileged stu-
denis.”

There are cighteen students now
at WAl who are considered under
privileged by admissions people, As
a fule, admissions people dislike
classifying applicants as such (we
are making ‘people’ decisions.” as
Dean Noell puts it and dealing with
individuals and individual criteria)
but an eur mcally daudvantap: i

stinfent ms generally considered to b

 

a student whose parental contribu-
tion to his educational costs is less
than $600. Eighteen such students
out of a total student population of
1600 does not alone constitute social
and economic diversity. More diver-
sity is evident in that about 23%
of the student body receives some
sort of financial aid.

Thus, the diversity now at W&L

properly, REACH-OUT will refer
the person to medical, psychiatric,
legal, or religious personnel who are
best qualified to handle the situation.
In this role the center will attempt
to coordinate all the existing com-
munity services and programs. It
has compiled lists of professionals,
paraprofessionls, clergymen and lay-
men who might be of help.

Ail exchanges with REACH-OUT
will be held strictly confidential in
order to maintain the trust necessary
as a basis for problem solving. Every
call and visit to the center will be
recorded to keep the program on a
professional level.

REACH-OUT originated in discus-
sions among Ken Lane, the Univer-
sity Center Director; the Rev, Mich-
ael Dwinell; and interested students
almost a year ago, when a need was
seen for trained personnel to heip
with drug abuse. A core group of
people, headed by Rev, Dwinell,
who is now the president of the
board of directors of the corpora-
tion, decided that a community
problem center was needed and not
simply a drug center involving pri-
marily university students, Some in-
spiration and training was provided
by a similar Roanoke program call-
ed TRUST.

REACH-OUT has been funded by
private donations so far, but at-
tempts are now being made to ac-
quire a state grant through the
Rockbridge Area Drug Council,
which coordinates all drug abuse ef-
forts in this area. The house on
North Main Street was donated by
V.M.I. and is being renovated pres-
ently.

About 50 volunteer workers have
completed the rigorous 36 hour
training program. Applicants were
screened both before and after the
training cycle. Included were ses-
sions on counseling, human rela-
tions, and drug abuse treatment with
doctors, psychologists, social work-
ers, and lawyers. Dr. Charles Hol-
land from Hollins College handled
sessions on primary relations, while
Rev. Dwinell explained general
counseling techniques. Tim Rodeli
from the TRUST program gave
talks on drug abuse, and Bill Hoff-
man from the Roanoke Total Action
Against Poverty group presented the
sessions on community relations,
Finally role plays dramatizing typi-
cal situations were used during some
sessions, The trainees met four

nights per week for two weeks.

So if you have a problem give
REACH-OUT a call any time of the
night or day. (463-7301).

it is the duty of those connoisseurs

Nevertheless | feel it is my duty
to now expose the plot. Though not

BY MONTY COTTIER

‘The wage-price freeze lately in-
stituted by our President (and re-
member if you can’t say anything
nice . . .), While it was originally
couched in terms of a polite request
that later hardened and toughened
into a rocky consistency faster than
a Chevrolet executive's face when
he found himself accidentally at a
Ralph Nader testimonial dinner, has
apparently had a little trouble infil-
trating down to the grass-roots level.

somewhat, for a variety of reasons.
To begin, it is the first word we have
ever written about the wage-price
freeze. We wanted to be known as
the only hack-writer in America who
hadn't waxed satirical on the sub-
ject.

It just goes to show what grinding

right with me, what the h--I are you
kicking about?), presupposes that
this thing will be printed while the
freeze is still on. It would be a good
joke on me if they held it back until
the spring of 1973, by which time
various pundits have predicted that
there will be no economy at all,
much less a wage-price freeze; and
there T'll be, hopelessly out of date.

But if we must go ahead and talk
about the freeze (and, after writing
this much, I guess it’s really too late
to back out now), it might be inter-
esting to see just what effect the
Nixon Paralysis has had locally.

It should, by now, come as no
great shock to most of the members
of the W&L academic community
(many of whom haven't had a good
jolt since the revelation that the
1958 Entertainment Committee was
considering replacing the costly party
concoction known as Grain Punch

Rebuttal by Ford

To the Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

From the administration and
others involved, | was given the im-
pression that nothing would be said
about the incident involving Johnny
White and myself leaving the foot-
ball squad; therefore, | declined
comment on the matter. Now, it
seems, that impression was false due
to Coach Buck Leslie’s statements
in the last Ring-tum Phi.

As far as the reference to not in-

forming me as to the time of sum-
mer practice because he (Coach Les-
lie) did not know of my intent to
play football, I believe that is a false
statement,

I had never heard of W&L until
my high school football coach in-
formed me of a recruitment meeting
held at my school by Dick Szlasa,
who was then offensive line coach of
the football team. I attended that
meeting and definitely spoke of my
desire to play football,

After being accepted at W&L, |
came to the school and spoke with
Coach Leslie who told me that the
team needed help in the line, a pos-
sible reason why | was converted to
a defensive end last season.

it is standard procedure for high
school coaches to provide player
evaluations to college coaches for
their prospective college players.
This was done by my coach at City.

Blows Against The Empire

BY W. PATRICK HINELY

Last Friday night. as anyone within
earshot could tell, there was a big
event in the quad. Earshot in this case
would include most of Rockbridge
County, | am sure. Yeah, well, it
just happens once a year .. . why not
whoop it up a little?

What happened in the quad last
Friday night, under federal law, re-
sults in charges the same as those levi-
ed against the Chicago Eight. You're
just lucky John Mitchell was a frat
man. Think about that one,
“straights.”

I cannot speak to critically of the
fraternity system which sponsored
last Friday's performance without ap-
pearing to be a hypocrite, (which
many would assert anyway), because
| myself affiliate with a house. If
someone was judging the system on
last Friday's merits, | would indeed
be ashamed to admit that | am a part
of such a group. | do feel justified
enough to say that what happened
was disgusting.

What happened right here at WAL
was much more disgusting than what
happened in Chicago in 1968, or Paris
in 1970, or any other number of cases
which might be cited. At least the
“bums” in the streets are doing what
they are with a meaningful purpose
in mind. All you “straights”’—and I
saw a lot of you out there—think
about this: What you did was worse
than what Jerry Rubin does for a
living!

Of course, you can shrink behind

Draft Number

The Selective Service System an
nounced on Tuesday, October § that
Random Sequence Number 125
would be the ceiling for induction
into the military for young men in
the 1971 first priority selection
group—that is, those registrants born
in 1951 of earlier who received lot
tery numbers in 1970 of 1969 and
are available for induction during
1971

The Department of Defense an
nounced a 10,000 draft call for the
remainder of 1971. Draft Director
Dr. Curtis W. Tarr said that Selec
tive Service local boards would de
liver 6.500 of these men in the per
November 1-18 and the fe
maining 1.500 in the period Novem
ber 29-Decemebr 9. Tarr said that
he has directed local boards to give
at least

ind

10 days notice to all regis
trants facing the induction process in
coming months. Current draft regu
lations require 10 days notice

Tarr sant that the uniform fa

several defenses: at least you had the
decency to do it on private property,
it's all in fun, it’s a tradition, at least
it wasn’t a bunch of long-hairs out to
make trouble, and so on. The excuses
are endless.

The face remains that the behavior
exhibited by a great majority of the
mob in that quad was not unlike that
of apes. Or perhaps I do injustice to
the apes, who can plead the innocence
of being animals anyway. A more ac-
curate comparison should be to PRI-
MITIVE humans.

The mentality which encourages
this kind of periodic letting off of
steam to celebrate events with the
magnitude of the end of rush has
manifested itself today in a group of
people known as “rednecks.” The pri-
mary characteristic of this type of per-
son is that while their bodies have
reached adulthood, their minds have
not. This is on the assumption that
they even have minds, which I often
consider doubtful. Their five o'clock
whistles are only recess bells. Remem-
ber “play period” way back in ele-
mentary school?

I was indeed fortunate to have the
vantage point of a second-floor win-
dow to watch the circus. In case you
wondered who the devil kept taking
pictures, it was me. My thanks to you
who were there for being such inter-
esting subjects. Thanks also to who-
ever threw that rock through the
window about four inches from my
head; it added a little excitement to
an otherwise boring evening. | am

1971 group who is 1-A and qualified
with a RSN of 125 and below that
he will receive an induction notice in
the near future. Tarr pointed out
that some of these men will enter
the Army in January, February or
March of next year because of the
extended liability provisions of the
Selective Service regulations

“Equity of treatment for all regis
trants requires that all men with
RSNs of 125 of lower face the in
duction process.” Tarr said

only glad that such a W&L gentle-
man had the sense not to throw a
rock carelessly; I am sure he aimed it
right at that one windowpane so that
all it would do is add another sound
effect to the living movie he was act-
ing in. | know he wouldn't have
thrown it if he thought it might hurt
someone.

When I showed some of the pic-
tures to a friend of mine from another
school, a school without fraternities,
and thus hopefully a less biased judg-
ment of the fraternity slystem, his
comment was that if | cropped the
dorm out of the edge of the shots and
put police uniforms on a few of the
subjects, | could make a lot of money
selling them as real live riot pictures!
Who needs violence?

I could only agree.

Basically, I just don't see how it
was humanly possible for the coach
to not know I wanted to play foot-
ball at Washington and Lee.

I would also like to state that not
making the Towson State game was
not my reason for quitting. Johnny
and I had talked to Coach Leslie the
Tuesday before that game and com-
plained, for the last time, about the
unfair practices we had been receiv-
ing. The Coach gave me the impres-
sion that something would be done.
When I finished Thursday's prac-
tice—I have biology lab on Wednes-
day—I saw that nothing had been
done; therefore, I decided to leave.
It just so happens that the traveling
list is posted after Thursday's prac-
tice (sometimes it's posted on Fri-
day).

The only questions I have for
Coach Leslie, in regards to race, are
why, if not for color, was I “weed-
ed” out of practice and why was
Johnny not taught his new position?
Also, why did he say that “some of
his best friends” were of my race:
what's sometimes referred to as a
standard line?

Honor System Riddles
To the Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

I'm really confused. | came to
Washington and Lee completely as-
sured that the Honor System works.
Two weeks ago my bicycle got a flat
tire. | put it into the dorm until |
could get at it to repair it. Someone
promptly stole my tire and broke my
gears.

Today | went to check my bike
once more. | had already moved it
to the basement to protect it from
the “townies” that everyone tells me
messed it up. The other tire had a
tack driven into it. Whoever did it,
I'm sorry he wasted his time like
that. | hope he's sorry, too.

W&L Offense Fails To Move Piggy
As Hampden-Sydney Wins 16-3

The Washington and Lee Gen-
erals once again bit the dust Satur-
day afternoon the Blue took on the
undefeated, untied, and unscored
upon Hampden-Sydney Tigers be-
fore a homecoming crowd of sev-
eral hundred. The 16-3 score did
not really indicate how the game
went as the Generals dropped their
third straight game this season,

Hampden-Sydney took the open-
ing kickoff but was unable to move.
On fourth down, and one yard to go,
the Tigers punted to the WAL 31
where Dave Brooks made a_ fair
catch. Steve Fluharty went in to
guide the Generals and on the first
play from scrimmage he went
around end for eight yards, On the
following play Jim Farrar picked up
a first down on a four yard plunge
up the middle, Farrar and JoJo Mar-
tin then combined their efforts on
the next two downs for a couple of
five yard gains and another first
down. With the ball on the Tiger 47
the Blue was only able to gain six
yards in three plays and Chappy
Conrad dropped back to punt, Con-
rad came through, as he has all sea-
son, punting to the Hampden-Sydney
one yard line where a Tiger returned
it two yards to the three.

Bobby Long went in to guide the
liger offense but was unsuccessful
as the Blue defense once again held
their ground. Jay Fulcher did a
great job dropping Long for losses
of five and six yards. Marshall
Washburn also intercepted a Long
pass (pardon the pun) but it was
nullified on an offside penalty
against the Blue, On fourth down,
nine yards to go, from their own
five, the Tigers elected to punt, It

was a short kick of only 33 yards
and Washburn returned the ball
two yards to the Hampden-Sydney
36.

Once again, the Blue offense came
in to see if they could get some-
thing going. They moved down to
the Tiger 21 after an interference
penalty on third down. From there,
the Generals were able to move only
two yards in three plays and on
fourth down Coach Leslie sent in
Doug Chase to attempt a field goal.
Chase made good on the 36 yard
try and W&L went ahead 3-0, This
was the first time the Tigers had
been scored upon all season.

Both teams exchanged the ball on
punts and turnovers without having
any success until mid-way in the
second period when Hampden-Syd-
ney had the ball on their own 14
yard line following a Conrad punt.
On the first play from scrimmage
the Blue defensive unit made its only
bad mistake of the game when it
allowed Owens to sweep right end
for 75 yards before being hauled
down on the General 11, The Tigers
moved to the one on an_ interfer-
ence penalty and Owens took it in
from there. The extra point was
good and Hampden-Sydney now
led by a 7-3 margin with 7:16 left
in the half. There was no more scor-
ing in the rest of the first half.

Hampden-Sydney kicked off in the
second half and Martin returned it
to the W&L 24, From there Flu-
harty moved the Blue down to the
liger 25, the big play in the drive
coming on a 28 yard pass play to
Conrad on third down. However, the
offense was unable to move as the
Tiger defense stiffened for four plays

and regained — possession at that
point,

Neither team was able to move
until late.in the third.quarter when
Conrad dropped back to punt with
the ball on the General 17 yard
line. The snap went over his head
and into the end zone for a safety.
This meant that the Generals would
have to kick it away from their own
twenty. with the score now. 9-3, Con-
rad punted down to the Tiger 40
where Richmond returned it 47
yards to the Blue 13 for the Tigers.
Five plays later Owens took it over
from three yards out to put the Tig-
ers in front by a score of 15-3. Page
added the extra point and with 14:40
left in the fourth quarter it was 16-3.

W&L took possession on their
own 24 following the kickoff. Flu-
harty then took the team down the
field to a first and ten at the Tiger
11. The big play in the drive came
on a 38 yard pass from Fluharty to
Mark Lane. On the first play at the
11 Fluharty’s pass was intercepted
at the Tiger four. Neither team scor-
ed the rest of the game as the final
score was 16-3 in favor of Hamp-
den-Sydney.

Next week the Generals will take
on Bucknell at home in what pro-

mises to be a tough game. Div. |

WGL Ruggers
Fall Short
A gaimst ODU

The W&L ruggers again fell vic-
tim to their second-half jinx, as they
fell to Old Dominion at Norfolk
Saturday. The Blue arrived in Nor-
folk with a mere sixteen men, as a
number of usual starters were un-
able to make the game, illness or
conflicting activity prevailing. They
were replaced by six inexperienced
players from this fall’s recruits. -
three of those six in the crux of the
offense, the backfield.

Sull, at the half, Old Dominion

held only a narrow 6-0 lead. But ,

with the start of the second half,
ODU scored a couple of quick trys
and kept moving from there, until
the final whistle sounded their vic-
tory, 30-3.

The Blue’s troubles came with an
Old Dominion change of strategy,
initiated by the temporary absence
from the game of one of the W&L
ruggers, due to a cut above the eye.
While the Blue were playing one
man short with 14 men, ODU mov-
ed one man out of the serum and
into the backfield, crippling the
Blue offense and pressuring the de-

Fred Fletcher scored the only
W&L points with a successful pen-

an outstanding job, notably Truta
and Sandy. Fred Fletcher did an all
around outstanding job, Bill Ander-

scrum-half also performed well for
the Blue.

The Blue go against Hampden-

Lacrosse Practice Opens Next Week

The W&L lacrosse program gets
under way with fall practice start-
ing next week Tuesday and intra-
mural lacrosse organizing this week.
Lacrosse coack Dick Szlasa stressed
that the intramural program is open
to all students who have not played

The IM program will lead up to
the JV program. Szlasa hopes that
even though a student dees not go
into the JV program, they will know
more about the game and will appre-
ciate it more as a spectator.

Fall practice for the varsity will
be highlighted by a scrimmage
against Roanoke on Nov. 20. It will
allow players to experiment at differ-
ent positions and give the coaches a

look at the freshmen and transfer
students.

Coach Szlasa expressed disappoint-
ment with a number of freshmen
recruited to play lacrosse, but feels
that their overall ability is excellent.
Five seniors and 12 juniors will be
returning from last year’s squad,
having lost only 3 through gradua-
tion, Szlasa enumerated the team’s

goals for this year. “First of all, we
want to win the conference title out-
right. Second, we want a berth in
the NCAA playoffs. We have to beat
either Virginia or Navy.”

“Last year we depended on Vir-
ginia to get us in the playoffs, This
year, we have to do it ourselves.”
The W&L lacrosse team was ranked

in the top ten last season. The squad
was ranked as the nation’s best col-
lege division eleven, With most of the
team returning this year the chances
of retaining the conference title are
bright.

l.aRue’s Pressbox

BY BOB “LASH” LARUE

Kicking the ball around the odd
zone while collecting my eager
money ... although Buck Leslie
would have cherished a win over
Hampden-Sydney last Saturday,
many consider the three points scor-
ed on the Tigers something of a vic-
tory in itself . . . the Generals field
goal was the first points scored on
Hampden-Sydney this season in four
games ... And while we're on the
subject of points, never has any team
run up so many on one of Darrell
Royal’s Texas squads as did Okla-
homa in the Sooners 48-27 romp
Ironically, while Oklahoma
showed its superiority, the team may
not even reach a bowl game, since
the Big Red must face top-ranked
Nebraska and number five Colorado
just to win the Big Eight Conference
title . . . Meanwhile, the Longhorns
will probably walk into the Cotton
Bowl again this year as the South-
west Conference's representative . . .
It’s this writer’s opinion that Wash-
ington and Lee Athletic Director Bill
McHenry came across extremely
well this past weekend during the
several talk sessions with visiting
alumni. , . Overheard comments in-
dicated that the alumni were favor-
ably impressed . . . While few alumni
these days now argue against Wash-
ington and Lee’s non-subsidization

program for intercollegiate athletics,
some still question W&L’s 1954 de-
cision . . . Anyhow, McHenry was
very convincing in his defense of
non-subsidized athletics . . . While
my heart is with the Pirates, my
money is on the Birds .. . Earlier I
felt the Buccos could extend the
World Series to seven games, but
the fabled Pittsburgh Pirates hitting
has faltered, and the pitching, ade-
quate at best, has collapsed .. . It
seems that the 1971 October Classic
adds more strength to the maxim
that good pitching will always han-
dle good hitting .. . And the rainout
Sunday which forces the cancellation
of a day of travel from Baltimore to
Pittsburgh is definitely to the Oriole’s
advantage, since the Pirates need
the time to allow their meager hill
corps to rest up... . Don’t count the
Bucs out in four games; make it
Baltimore in five, at the outside six
. . . Incidentally, this is the twenty-
fifth World Series to be televised . . .
I'm still worked up about that Big
Eight showdown . . . Should Okla-
at Thanksgiving . . . Should Okla-
homa beat Colorado this week, and
if both the Sooners and Nebraska
remain undefeated until their meet-
ing in Norman, that Turkey Day
confrontation may determine not
only the conference title but also the
national championship.

Policy on Admissions Reflects
Dim State of Today’s Economy

(Continued from page 2)

is not one of extremes (i.e. very rich
and very poor), rather one some-
where in the middle. This state re-
volves around the critical decisions
made by admissions people: whether
to give a larger sum of money to
one student or smaller sums to a
number of students. It is the most
difficult of all the decisions faced It
does little good for the University or
the applicant if the school can only
provide a portion of what a student
needs to attend the school, The ap-
plicant would be forced to attend
another school where his financial
needs are met or afe not as great.

On the other hand, if the Univer-
sity were to agree to meet the needs
of a student with great need, it
would) mean a concentration of
funds in one area and maybe mean
that a number of students with jesser
needs would be deprived of help.
“Individual decisions, subjective de-
cisions, have to be made,” says Dean
Noell, “and they are not easy.”

Although they can never help all
the people they would like to help,
admissions people are pleased with
the calibre of student they have
been able to attract. In fact, Dean
Farrar remains “very heartened”
about W&L’s showing last year. The
number of applicants has continued
to rise (total of 1260 for 1971). Also,
there has been a slight rise in aver-
age S.A.T. scores over the scores of
previous classes. (Verbal-575; Math-
615).

Dean Farrar does not perceive
any great differences, but believes
that “the calibre of students this year
appears a little stronger than last
year's.” He terms this “very encour
aging” at a time when the majority
of small, private institutions are ex-
periencing problems and even hav-
ing to compromise. Many of them
choose, because of financial reali-
ties, to go coed, hoping to capitalize
on the present trend in college edu
cation. W&L’s position, although not

as financially confident as it used to
be (as is the case with virtually all
institutions) is not in any real seri-
ous trouble, either. That is, the Uni-
versity although it is always study-
ing the possibility, has “no present
plans to go coed”, according to Dean
Farrar. No great expansion of the
exchange program which brings 23
females from surrounding schools to
the predominately male W&L cam-
pus is anticipated.

The University will continue, then,
along its present path of trying to
reach geographic, economic, and
social cross sections of the nation
within the limitations imposed by
an all male population and, more
exactly, within the limits dictated by
its financial aid pocketbook. Recruit-
ment at local high schools by the
S.R.C. and at schools across the na-
tion will continue with the intention
still that of attracting quality stu-
dents to quality education,

Sha-Na-Na Coming

For February Concert

Headliners for W&L’s first three
concerts have been announced by
the University Dance Board, with
the promise of at least two more
concerts to follow suit,

Homecoming weekend will pro-
vide the scenario for the first con-
cert of the year when the exciting
Chambers Brothers come to Lexing-
ton. The concert has been set for
Saturday night, October 23, in the
old section of Doremus Gym. All
subsequent concerts will be held in
the new section. Tickets may be pur-
chased at the door for the 8 p.m.
performance at $5 per person. Dance
plans for the entire season will be
available in the Co-op at $40 until
Friday, October 22.

Gordon Lightfoot will be on hand
in a Nov. 20 concert, followed by
the return engagement of Sha-Na-Na
on Feb. 12. The most popular attrac-
tion to hit W&L for years with their
concert last year, Sha-Na-Na will
share the bill with one of the leg-
ends of yesteryear they re-create,
probably Bo Diddley.

Additional concerts are planned
for the first or second weekend in
March and the first, in May.

with a much more economical, and
equally devastating, brew derived
from reconstituted orange drink and
a good, healthy dose of Sterno) that
prices in the Co-op have risen mark-
edly, in some cases by as much as
100 per cent.

Even though, on the surface, the
fact that the price increases went
through on August 3 should absolve
those concerned from all guilt, we
find that the coincidence of timing in
this matter is simply too great to be
mere coincidence (did you get that,
or must we go through it again?).

Further, it goes without saying
(although, due to a lack of anything
else to fill the space, I'm going to say
it anyway) that W&L is no longer
the rich boy's school it once was.
Can we silently endure the piteous
spectacle of countless student, many
of them from deprived backgrounds,
falling victim daily to advanced cata-
tonia in classrooms all across the
campus, simply because the life- and
face-saving grace of hot coffee (from
five cents to ten cents), hot tea (like-
wise) or iced coffee (from 16 to 21
cents) have been priced beyond their
reach? There are laws governing
public menaces such as diptheria
carriers, purse-snatchers, and Bad
Men who make dishonest livings off
the savings of widows and orphans;
shall this new plunge go untrammel-
ed? (f seem to be asking an awful
lot of questions. Don't bother an-
swering themb, please).

sise in forecasting by which the price
increase in the Co-op preceeded the
freeze by a scant 12 days (one of
the benefits of writing a column like

this is that one need not necessarily
make a fetish out of literary organi-
zation), considering the vast mone-
tary sums involved, it is too much to
ask for an investigation into the poli-
tical connections and considerations
enjoyed by the staff and manage-
ment of the Co-op? While it is true
that Harding’s administration was
destroyed by some scandal or other,
and Grant's chicaneries finally ruin-
ed his health and forced him to
write interminable memoirs (I'm
working entirely without references
or notes on this, so I feel that a little
laxity in the matter of historical data
can be overlooked. There is such a
thing as useless pedantry, you know),

Intramural Football

BY RAY SWAN

Intramural football climaxes next
week with two division races still un-
decided. In division 1, the PiKAs
must beat the Law School tomorrow
and then win the rest of their games.
The Sigma Chis must do the same
against the Delts in Division 3, Divi-
sions 2 and 4 are pretty well wrap-
ped up by the Phi Delts and Phi
Gams, the only two undefeated
teams.

The present division leaders are
favored to hold onto their positions
until the playoffs. After that, any-
thing can happen, but I'll go with
the Phi Delts and Phi Gams in the
divisional playoffs.

For the championship, the Phi
Delts seem to have the edge, especi-
ally in the backfield. The Phi Gam
line relies on strength to penetrate
and will have to depend more on
speed to contain the Phi Delt backs,
led by QB Charles Comly.

Calls For Research On War

(Continued from page 1)
indirectly caused by the war. In
Vietnam thus far. there have been
about 1,500,000 listed casualties,
while the indirect death toll has risen
above the 3,000,000 mark.

Here the guest speaker, using
World War II and the Vietnam War
as examples, separated all-out wars
from those of a limited basis. “A
limited war (such as Vietnam) is
limited in its means .. . the nations
do not use all effective means at
their disposals.” He cited unlimited
submarine warfare, genocide, and
the dropping of the atom bomb
at Hiroshima as examples of all-out
warfare. Dr. Duetsch also suggested
that wars are generally limited in
their means, as well as their aims,
among nations of equal strength,
while wars between imbalanced pow-
ers are generally all-out. He gloom-
ily theorized that if we ever do have
an all-out war between major pow-
ers at the present level of military
armament, “there is a good chance
that we will never have another one
.. . there is a good chance that it
would be the last.”

In further research into the period
from 1816-1965. the professor ask-
ed, “Who initiated the wars? Did
the initiator win? After all, there's
not much rationality in starting a
war that you're going to lose.” In
the 1800's, he noted that 80 per cent
of the wars were won by the initia-
tors (whom he defined as the gov-
ernment who moved mass troops
and materials across an international
boundary with the purpose of re-
maining there).

However, Professor Deutsch then
pointed out that. since 1910. over
60 per cent of the wars have been
lost by the initiators. He cited that
a combination of less diplomatic

Statesmen, a more complicated
world, and the overburdening of
governments as compared to the
1800's was probably the major fac-
tor in this percentage drop.

He then probed the causes of war.

To begin with, the Harvard doctor
listed ten levels of the present world
social system, ranging from the in-
dividual to the United Nations, each
of which could commit an act in-
creasing the likelihood of war. Pro-
fessor Deutsch then suggested ten
steps towards war, the first being the
nature of an individual, and the last
being escalation as a result of an
international crisis. He noted that if
each of these steps could be diverted
away from the homing signal of
war, “we can make war less likely.”

He reasoned that war, like the
once-accepted practices of cannibal-
ism and slavery, can be wiped out,
implying that our thoughts and feel-
ings towards war can and will
change.

In conclusion, Dr. Deutsch stated
that. in our present world, “two
more headaches must go—mass pov-
erty and war.” He claimed mass
poverty'’s elimination as a distinct
possibility of the near future. “It can
be done tomorrow if we really
want.” He then alluded to a simi-
lar solution, through research, to
war, concluding, “we are living in
the greatest period of transforma-
tion ever. We must change this habit
of mankind (war) so that mankind
can live at all.”

+s AND THAT MEANS
You, 0!

    

still we must not shy away from dis-
covering the facts behind this matter.

However, perhaps it’s all for the
best. College, if it does nothing else,
should prepare us to take our place
in the outside world, and, in this day
of inflation, paying five cents for a
cup of coffee lends an aura of fan-
tasy to our everyday lives which is
as sinister as it is all-pervasive,

In this light, it is probably all for
the best that the prices have gone
up. There are few enough of the old
traditions around, and it is fitting
that nickle coffee has gone the way
of the beanie and the three-piece
suit. You can’t have your tie, and eat

Election Is Monday, Five Run For EC.

Duncan DeGraft
Exectutive Committee

Each year, the freshmen along
with the upperclassmen should, after
close analysis of the System and of
themselves, dedicate themselves to
the goals of the Honor System, If
everyone did commit themselves,
they would be abiding by the state-
ment: “A Washington and Lee stu-
dent is to conduct himself as a
gentleman in matters of honor at all
times; he is trusted and he assumes
the obligation to be trustworthy.”
This common goal of trust among
all Washington and Lee students is
a bond which not only gives respect
to the individual but also gives one
an ideal he may live by. Belief in
one’s fellow man is easier to achieve,
if all Washington and Lee students
are striving for the same ideal.

As a candidate for the Freshman
Representative to the Executive
Committee, I would, if elected, try
to unite the Freshman Class in order
to achieve the cherished goal of
trust among men. Trust can be
obtained from men of varied back-
grounds only if there is a common
purpose, Our purpose will be to
endorse the Honor Code.

The best way to endorse the
Honor Code is to vigorously put it
into use. Whether one is in the
cafeteria or in the classroom, the

ULC.

Bob Keatley

As newcomers to W&L, the fresh-
men may not fully understand the
workings of W&L or its student gov-
ernment, but there are a few things
that we, as freshmen, have already
noticed. I've had the opportunity to
talk with several people in the dorms
so far and I've been given some
ideas on what these people feel are
issues affecting freshmen.

One idea was that contract food
in Evans Dining Hall should be op-
tional after the fall term of the
freshman year. Another is to keep
the Supply Store and Co-op open
during the day on Saturday and on
Sunday afternoons. A third was to
not allow townspeople in the game
room of the University Center. The
University Center is for W&L stu-
dents and their guests-not for use as
a community recreation hall.

The freshman class should be
given a chance to meet their candi-
dates for office. I feel that an open
house one evening in the student
government office with all the candi-
dates present would give freshmen a
chance to come by and find out who
the candidates are.

These ideas are not necessarily
mine; but rather they are the ideas
of the freshmen I've had a chance to
talk with. If I'm elected, | plan to
do exactly the same thing-that is,
talk to you and find out what you
feel needs to be done. Its not my
voice that needs to be heard but the
voice of the freshman class.

Larry Lyles
The University Council, unlike
the Executive Committee. is not
familiar to the large majority of

Code should be in effect. Through
this active use, the individuals who
abide by the code will gain the
respect of his fellow classmates.
Respect will be the main theme
uniting freshmen to themselves and
to the rest of the college community.

Tav Lupton

Of primary importance to the Exe-
cutive Committee is the role of the
Honor Code. I believe the Code
should be responsive to the student
body and, in return, be actively sup-
ported by the students. The success
or failure of the Honor Code rests
with each individual student's will-
ingness to make it work,

In view of this, then, the E.C.
should, in hearing an honor trial,
consider the intent of the individual
as to whether a possible violation
was committed maliciously or not,
and any or all mitigating circum-
stances should be taken into con-
sideration, As the freshman repre-
sentative, I would keep these
thoughts in mind.

However, the Honor Code is not
the sole function of the E.C.; the
Committee oversees all forms of stu-
dent government. I will be working
for the best interests of the freshman
class in all matters such as curri-
culum changes, dormitory regula-
tions, and any change in student
government. As an elected freshman

representative, [| will have consider-
able influence with the administra-
tion officials concerning any wishes
or recommendations of the freshman
class.

As for a list of promises, I can’t
give you one. If elected, | am only
one member of a council of twelve
people and must accept any decision
made by a majority of that group.
What | can promise is that I am
willing to devote all the time neces-
sary to do the best job I possibly
can in representing the freshman
class.

Paul Malin
Candidate for EC Representative

Student government is playing an
increasingly stronger role in student
affairs. Ten years ago parietals were
dictated by the school administra-
tion. Last week a composite com-
mittee voted on W&L parietals. We
as W&L freshmen are reaping the
benefits of years of progress in stu-
dent government.

W&L student government has two
major branches — the Executive
Committee and the University Coun-
cil, All campus activities and pos-
sible violations are under the juris-
diction of the Executive Committee.
Formed last year, the University
Council decides university policies.
As a member of the U. C., students
have a direct voice and vote in

eat Contested

WA&L students. The chief reason for
this is that it is a new body, con-
ceived only last year.

The Council serves as the highest
authority over all student affairs, ex-
cept the honor system and curricular
matters. It is responsible for the
regulation of student and fraternity
conduct, F.C. activities, and dormi-
tory rules.

Probably the issue of greatest in-
terest to Freshmen is that of parie-
tals. Recently, the Council voted
only to extend parietal guidelines
rather than abolish them. This action
has made even more obvious the
uselessness of retaining rarely en-
forced rules. If a dorm section votes
to have full parietals, the week-end
restrictions—noon Friday to mid-
night Sunday, with no overnight
visitation—are virtually impossible
to enforce. The clause concerning
overnight visitation is certainly on
the books for appearance only. and
should be abolished. (The same
argument might be applied to week-
day restrictions, but further consid-
eration is in order before these are
cast aside.)

Another regulation which will be-
come of interest to many Freshmen
is that requiring fraternities to re-
tain housemothers. This is another
“appearance only” rule, and in most
cases. the housemothers constitute
an unnecessary financial burden.
Space limitations prohibit discussion
of other important matters, but it is
within the scope of the Council's
power to effect many needed
changes. Concerned students need to
let their representative know their
opinions so that he can represent
them both responsively and respon-
sibly.

Andy Mehaffey

We are all aware of the bitter
confrontations between students and
faculty in universities all around the
country concerning the right of the
students to govern themselves and
have a say in formulating university
policies. I feel that the only efficient
and sensible way to express dis-
satisfaction and bring about con-
structive change is to work within
the framework of the university. We
here at Washington and Lee are
fortunate in that our school has
given us a good framework for
change in which to operate; this is
the University Council. One of the
great problems of any very old uni-
versity is that of tradition. Tradition
has always been very strong at
Washington and Lee as well it
should be, for we have a_ great
heritage at this university. However
we must be careful not to let tradi-
tion become our master. The tradi-
tions must be adapted to ever chang-
ing customs in order to maintain
their relevancy. | feel that the Uni-
versity Council is vital in bringing
about constructive change while up-
holding the great traditions and
heritage of WashingtOn and Lee. It
is you the students of Washington
and Lee that are even now con-
tributing to the heritage of this
institution, and your most direct
path towards a meaningful contri-
bution is your University Council.
As freshman candidate for the Uni-
versity Council, I should like very
much to be the voice of the fresh-
man class in shaping the heritage of
Washington and Lee, and I will
always try to be available to hear
your suggestions and complaints.

Four Seeking Vice-Presidency

Tom Lancaster

The freshman of WA&L look upon
this election and student govern-
ment as a whole from many view-
points. To many, this campaign
means they don't want the endiess
number of posters cluttering their
dorm halls. To others, those who
would really like to put the best man
in office, the myriad names and
faces only confuse maters. Probably
few truly know enough of what is
going on to make a wise choice or a
sound opinion, Furthermore, the of-
fices themselves, and their respon-
sibilities, are even more vague. Tm
not claiming to be any different. I
am running because | would like to
get involved and find out from the
inside, what is happening in our stu-
dent government. This means my
winning the election. My only pro-
mise is total involvement, not solely
in upholding the responsibilities of
the Vice-Presidency, but in repre-
senting the opinions of all freshman
| would appreciate your vote.

Bill Lassetter

Because I feel that | can make a
substantial, worthwhile contribution
to class government, | have become
a eandidate for the office of Vice
President of the Freshman Class
Teo often the duties of Vice-Presi
dent are ignored because they are
considered unimportant. | hope to
make full use of the powers of this

office to benefit both the Freshman
class and the university as a whole.

Specifically, | am opposed to the
collection of exorbitant class dues
when little explanation of their in-
tended use is given. | intend, if elect-
ed, to put the good of the university
above the good of the class, and
will strive to encourage active par
ticipation of freshmen in all politi-
cal areas, inside as well as outside
the influence o [this school.

| would appreciate your support
in these endeavors.

Bill Lassetter
David Rigby
lo the freshman class:

Many Washington and Lee fresh-
man are faced with a new and chal-
lenging situation here. There are

which are different from high school

also for the future

fo the Washington & Lee freshman
class:
Up until this time, there has been
a lack of unity in the freshman class.
This is due primarily to the lack of
leadership. True, we have not had
anyone in power to this date, bui we
are about to settle this deficit. 1 feel
thai with my pasi exposure to stu-
dent government and my strong feel-
ings toward having a supreme gradu-
ating class. | can. and will. do a
good job in the position of vice
president
I realize. also. that there has
been a lack in the upholding of the
Honor Code. Every student that ix
admitted info this institution knows

about the Washingion and Lee
Honor Sysiem. We are only one
month into the «school vear. and
numerous thefis have already oc
cured. |, myself. have had a vers

policy issues such as parietals. The
recent formation of the U.C. ex-
emplifies increasing student control
of W&L’s future.

In the first U. C. meeting, the stu-
dents and administration voted with
few exceptions in blocks. When
future issues come up, I foresee that
these lines between student and fac-
ulty will fall. When this happens,
the student government will not be
fighting the “system” but exerting
its will through it. To accomplish
this we must elect to all government
positions men who will work toward
this as a goal.

I want to be a part of our
progressive system of government.
I am seeking the E.C. post in order
to become a constructive part of the
WAL student government. I will up-
hold the Honor System and strive
to keep it strong. By doing this I
hope to contribute to the overall
strength of the student government.
| am coming by this week to talk
with each freshman and look for-
ward to hearing your ideas on stu-
dent government.

Will Scott
Freshman Representative to E.C.

I have three reasons for running:
1) to help represent the views of the
freshman class honestly, 2) to have
a direct say in the decisions made
while we are at W&L. 3) to serve
the freshman class as it deserves to
be served.

Upon my election [I will fulfill six
objectives: a) the upholding of the
Honor Code at it is at W&L, b) to
give the frosh a clear, distinct, and
intelligent voice to the rest of the
community and be a strong sounding
beard for their ideas, more specific-
ally, c) | endorse the concept be-
hind Lewis Powell's resolution
abolishing parietals, but understand

the bind this would put on President
Huntley and many fund raisers, d)
| support the maintainance of a
strong fraternity system and at the
same time will insure that the inde-
pendent’s life can be meaningful,
productive, and enjoyable, e) I will
investigate the rule concerning
“townies” on campus and the en-
forcement measures used, and very
importantly, f) I support the Student
Association of Black Unity, because
it is from this organization that
“Black Power” will be supplied with
brainpower.

Certainly my leadership qualifica-
tions, 1) Past President of the Rich-
mond area Teenage Republicans, 2)
Past President of the Brotherhood
of St. Andrew's, 3) pledge of Phi
Kappa Sigma fraternity, and 4) the
fact that | am serving my country
via ROTC (of course my draft
number is 25) gives me as good
qualifications as anyone else.

I do want to serve and I would
like to win. Thank you, very much.

Will Scott
October 13, 1971

Barney Skelton
The idea of listing specific cam-
paign promises rather turns me off,
so you won't hear any. | will,

though, tell you what to expect, in
general terms, if you do elect me to
the Executive Committee.

You can expect me to be first and
foremost, an advocate for the Fresh-
man class in the general affairs of
the school. I don't believe that I
am the only one who is tired of
hearing a number of subtle, but de-
finitely impugning remarks concern-
ing our class. I address this griev-
ance particularly to the crack edi-
torial staff of the Ring-tum Phi, who
seem to delight in sniping at us
weekly about one trivality or an-
other. They observe with disdain
that some of us err from traditional
dress. They seem to think that we
have it too easy, now that we can
more or less choose our own courses,
In general, it seems that we are sim-
ply not up to par.

Obviously, we are “up to par.” In
fact we are as strong or stronger
than any class that has ever been
here. We believe in Washington and
Lee, its Honor Code and its tradi-
tions just as much as any class has.

If you wish to have a person serv-
ing you on the E.C. who is for the
Freshman class, for the Honor Sys-
tem, but most importantly, for
Washington and Lee, | would ap-
preciate your vote.

President To Be Elected

Bill Biesel

My name is Bill Biesel. | am a
candidate for Freshman Class Presi-
dent, an office which carries with it
not only administrative responsibili-
ties but social responsibilities as well.
The President becomes a member of
the Student Control Committee and
also assumes a place on the Planning
and Development Committee. From
the social viewpoint he is in charge
of one of the big weekends and is
on the University Dance Board.
Now in this capacity, | would be in
a position to support existing regula-
tions, but also, and more important-
ly, to change them or institute new
ones as necessary. A few proposals
I have in mind are installing a mail
box between the old and new Fresh-
man Dorms. and attempting to get
more hot water for the old dorm.
Realistically, though, | would have
little power other than that of influ-
ence, but with your votes behind me.
the chances of carrying oul any pro-
mises will be greater. Your support
is the key to the betterment of the
Class of ‘75. Remember me. Bill
Biesel.

Carl Cassidy

Next Monday, you will choose a
class president. In the past, his only
duty has been the supervision of the
Springs Weekend. The traditional
unimportance of the job reflects the
lack of emphasis placed on the class
as a body. People have tended to
identify exclusively with their fra-
ternity brothers rather than with
other members of the class. I would
like to see the class get together for
at least one party which could be
financed by a money-raising project
rather than out of your pockets.

if elected. | would represent the
class, not the administration. on
such questions as parictals. Most
students seem to desire unrestricted

port this and any other cause popu
lar to the members of the Class of

Jeffrey Fischer

Without a doubt. the reason be-
hind my candidacy for Freshman
President is that | want to change
his image and function. In the past
years, his main responsibility has
been to run the Fancy Dress cock-
tail party. something | will continue

to do, in the tradition of great
WAL. erain parties.
However the age of the party

boy president is fading fast and to-
day's student leader must realize his
duty and right to help shape the
institution around him. This year
for the first time, the Freshman
President will sit on the Planning
and Development Committee. As the
role of the fraternities in housing
stidents decreases. this body be-
comes increasingly important in
planning new upperclass dorms, as
well as the new library and law
school
This is but one example of how
I plan to develop the office of presi-
dent into a meanineful and signifi
cant part of WAL government and
life

I believe the Presidency can be-

position with channels through
which Freshmen can voice approval
or disenchantment with University
policies affecting them. One such
program which I am sure Freshmen
would like to air their views on is
the planning of orientation. | would
like to form a committee to review
and improve the program for future
classes. | would also like to set up a
suggestion box where Freshmen
could let their opinions be known

If elected | would like to imple-

would make the Freshman Class
Presidency a working office and not
just a status symbol.

Louis LeLaurin

John Keith

I propose to end the war in Viet-
nam, establish peace in the world,
and stop all poverty.

This platform is just as reason-
able as anyone's here because as
conditions at Washington and Lee
stand today any issue that suggests
change is rejected by the University
faculty.

Therefore | won't make promises
to abolish rules that the University
keeps primarily to look good on its
books.

| feel that our problems can not
even be discussed until the faculty
can be shown that we, the students,
have changed considerably in the
past few years. Then and only then
will there not be any University
blocks of changes that are needed
for our class.

With your support, | will take
the truth to the administration and
sincerely try to show them that poli-
cies can change as students change
without losing the high ideals that
Washington and Lee has possessed
for over a century.

empire and to encourage the arts

wishes of my heart.”

Chambers Brothers Highlight Weekend

Highlighting the upcoming week-
end will be a Homecoming football
contest, a Red Square cocktail

party, and the concert appearance of
the Chambers Brothers at Doremus
Gymnasium on Saturday night. This
will be the first area performance

by the group since their sellout con-
cert at the University of Virginia
two years ago,

The afternoon activities will begin
with the game, beginning at 2 p.m.
on Wilson Field, between Washing-
ton and Lee and Western Maryland.

This will be followed with a grain
party in Red Square (no one who
does not possess a card signifying
his payment of class dues will be
served).

The Chambers Brothers are prob-
ably best known for their recording

November 20, will be held in the
new gym. There will be no seats, so

Senator Spong To Speak

Senator William B. Spong of Vir-
ginia will deliver the fall keynote
address for the 1972 Mock Conven-
tion in Lee Chapel at 8 p.m. next
Monday, October 25. Senator Spong
will be speaking on the subject of
Democratic politics in the coming
decade. Because of the diversity of
assignments given him in the USS.
Senate he is highly qualified to speak
on the topic.

Although he has been in the Sen-
ate for a litthke more than four years,
he has just been seated on the pres-
tigious Foreign Relations Commit-
tee. The only other Democrat nam-
ed to the Committee in this Congress
was third-term Senator Edmund S.
Muskie of Maine. Spong is also a
member of the Commerce Com-
mittee. Earlier this year the Senator
was named to fill the seat of retiring
Senator Eugene McCarthy on the
Select Committee on Standards and
Conduct. This was recognition of his
continuous efforts in the area of eth-
ics of elected officials. He has spon-
sored legislation in every Congress
since 1967 to require full public dis-
closure of assets and liabilities.

Senator Spong has voluntarily
made such disclosures each year
since he entered the Senate. He has
also advocated similar disclosures of
the sources of campaign financing.
The Senator also serves on the Mon-
dale Select Committee on Educa-
tion and the influential Democratic
Steering Committee of the Senate.

Spong’s brief Senate career has
often involved him in controversy.
In 1969 when Senator George Mc-
Govern was dramatizing the prob-
lem of hunger in America, Spong
made a series of trips through his
own state to investigate the impact
and efficacy of existing programs.

Initial editorial reaction was un-
favorable to his tour, but Spong
completed it as planned and uncov-
ered the fact that many people elig-
ible for existing programs has either
been left unaware of their availabil-
ity or lacked sufficient training in
nutrition to make use of the food
provided. His personal intervention

here made the programs more effec-
tive while eliminating some misun-
derstandings about the problem of
hunger and the approaches to its
solution.

There has been some speculation
on Spong as a possibility for the
Supreme Court. Spong has not en-
couraged this speculation, but his
own votes on nominees to the High
Court have focused attention on him
in recent years when the Court has
been a public issue,

Senator Spong is a native of Ports-
mouth. He is a graduate of Hamp-
den-Sydney College and the Univer-
sity of Virginia Law School.

Renowned Scholars Lecture

fessor of metallurgical engineering,
and a Yale sociologist specializing in
family structure and mental
iliness—will lecture at W&L during
the second half of October.

Dr. Kenneth Stampp, author of
“The Peculiar Institution” and “The
Era of Reconstruction. 1865 to
1877,” both atempting to revise tra
ditionally accepted interpretations of
slavery and Reconstruction, will
speak on “How an _ Historian
Changes his Mind” tonight at 8 p.m.

OUTLOOK andREVIEW |

October 20, 1971

During the Special Alumni Conference last weekend, stu-
dents and administrators stressed the need for alumni sup-
port to Washington and Lee. Two specific types of support
were emphasized: reeruitment and financial.

Dean of Students, Lewis John, explained the key role that
alumni play in attracting superior students to W&L,. Accord-
ing to the dean, more current W&L freshmen learned about
this institution through alumni contacts than any other means.
Therefore, alumni were continually informed last weekend
that their recruiting efforts would be a great boon to the
university.

Perhaps a more obvious type of alumni support Washing-
ton and Lee University seeks is donations. Alumni Fund gifts
constituted 6.64 per cent of the educational and general ex-
penses incurred during the 1970-1971 fiscal year. Washington
and Lee simply could not balance its budget without alumni
help.

After the alumni heard this two-fold plea for support from
their alma mater, the W&L graduates countered with their
own two-fold plea to the students. First, the alumni expressed
growing concern over the possible decline in the spirit of
W&L. They pointed to the diminishing esteem of certain tra-
ditions: conventional dress, the speaking tradition, and the
Fancy Dress Ball. Second, alumni suggested that students per-
sonally help defray the cost of their education along these
lines. A unique idea was fostered by Robert P. Smith Jr. of
Jacksonville, Florida, and a member of the class of 1954. Mr.
Smith proposed that he and other interested alumni would
match one dollar contributions made by students.

The plan makes sense. As Mr. Smith pointed out, alumni
rarely give regular donations to the university until a decade
after their graduation. The result is a lag for alumni during
which they are not involved in the institution’s operation.
Getting soon-to-be-alumni into the habit of financially support-
ing W&L would help alleviate the lag.

Mike McCall, a senior on the Student Development Com-
mittee, is in charge of developing this innovative approach to
raising money. A total of nine alumni have pledged matching
funds to cover donations by most of the student body. So, we
will await the implementation of this plan. Mr. MeCall ap-
parently must overcome only minor logistic problems to fulfill
Mr. Smith’s idea,

Parietals. The subject must be getting a little dated to the
W&L administrators. However, parietal regulations seem
equally dated to dormitory residents who must live under
them.

A few recent occurences should have direct effeet on this
unsettled issue of having or not having female visitation in
the dorms. The dormitory counselors, at the urging of coor-
dinator of the freshman year, William Schildt, have met con-
cerning parictals. The counselors are attempting to present a
written consensus of their views to both the Student Affairs
Committee and the University Council, The desire of the coun-
selors is to present a fair picture of the current status of
parietals in the dorms to the bodies that govern student af-
fairs.

In addition a newly elected freshman representative will
take part in the next University Council session. Inherently,
freshmen are the students most directly affected by dormitory
regulations. It is hoped that this elected individual will pre-
sent to the council the views of his peers, the members of the
class of ‘75,

What these two occurences mean is that more debate de-
joth the SAC and the Uni-
versity Council will convene tomorrow. Neither group plans to

serves to be heard on this issue.

discuss parietals or more correctly, stated, neither has debate
concerning parietals on the agenda.

This course of action would disregard the previously men
tioned developments. At the very least the dormitory coun
selors should be heard. After all, according to published
criteria for dorm counselor selection, these “positions are con-
sidered to be the most responsible entrusted to Washington
and Lee students.” Such a group of responsible men plus duly
elected officials of the freshman class, should be allowed to
present their cases.

Some think parietals are not an issue any more. Yet, the
issue cannot rationally be settled until those directly affected
express their criticisms and praises of the existing parieta!

University Federation Offers
Variety Of Volunteer Activities

BY DOUG McNEEL

Ever get the feeling that this old
world is turning sour with bitterness,
cynicism and despondency? There
are some people who need warmth,
tenderness, respect and __ interest.
They can do without the bitterness,
cynicism and defeatism. Consider
the physically handicapped, the men-
tally ill, those bordering on juvenile
delinquency and the old. These peo-
ple can’t afford to let ugliness creep
into their lives. They need hope to
be able to cope with their problems.
They need help from people like
you.

The popular song “You've Got To
Try A Little Kindness” points up
the problem and its solution. Some
are “standing by the road with a
heavy load” while others are “fall-
ing by the way”. These are people
who need and want your help.

The University Federation is a
community service organization de-
signed to involve students in meet-
ing the problems of the community-
problems such as mental illness, juv-
enile delinquency, physical handi-
caps and the isolation of the old.
These are very human problems
which will always be with us. Just
because these problems won't be
licked 100% does not mean that it
is futile to work towards a better
situation. On an_ individual level,
someone might work his way out of
a mental institution, someone might
learn to accept his or her physical
handicaps, someone might decide to
get out and stay out of the rut of
juvenile delinquency and someone
whose body has atrophied might
come to feel young at heart. Even
though a problem is not totally solv-
ed, even though we do not and shall
not ever live in an ideal world, you
can lend a helping hand to someone
and make his world a little nicer.

One of the opportunities for this is
volunteer work which the University
Federation is sponsoring. There are
six volunteer programs outlined be-
low which you are welcome to take
part in.

Old Folk Homes

Picture a house of old people who
have little to look forward to in
life. At the front of the room sits a

television which is almost constantly
on. The people in the room stare
blankly into the distance. Some are
even looking at the television and
possibly some are actually interested
in the program. There is little con-
versation and of course nothing to
talk about. There are old folk homes
like this all over the country.

The University Federation is fund-
ing the visits which Washington and
Lee and Sweetbriar students are
making to the State District Home
for the Aged in Chatham, Virginia.
Once a month students talk and
joke with the people who live at
Chatham House. The visit to Chat-
ham not only brightens the lives of
the folks there, but it can also be
rewarding to the visitor.

If you would like to visit the folks
at Chatham, please contact Tim
Bookas at 463-2914,

Western State Program

How would you like to be com-
mitted to a mental institution? Ever
thought about what it would be like?

Thirty-five miles north of here is a
state supported mental hospital,
Western State, in Staunton, It has
been allocated a lot of money for
material resources. It has a nice re-
creation center with pool tables,
ping pong tables, a basketball court,
a stage and a coffee shop. But, for
some reason, Western State is not
sufficiently staffed. Manpower is the
big need. Many patients who need
psychiatric help or attention are
stuck in Western State without ade-
quate professional help. One psy-
chiatrist, to my knowledge, is re-
sponsible for 200 patients. Seeing
one patient a day, every day, this
psychiatrist would be able to attend
to all of her patients once in a little
over half a year's time.

The burden of helping the pati-
ents rests on the shoulders of volun-
teers and that means you. Students
from Washington and Lee are going
up to Western State on a weekly bas-
is, spending fro mone to two hours
talking, playing football and just
plain horsing around with patients
who need, want and appreciate help.

You don't need to know anything
about psychology to participate in
this program. What we have tried to

do in the past is to have a good time
with the patients in the hope that
this may somehow help them. Al-
ways, you. must be ready to talk
seriously with the patient whenever
he has something pressing to say,

To get involved in this program,
give Michael Edwards a call. His
office answers with a tape recording
machine when he is not in so in that
case, state your. wish, give your
dorm, room number, telephone num-
ber and day or days when you
would best be able to work at Wes-
tern State. If you can go Sunday,
there is a car which leaves here at
1:00 p.m. and returns by 5:00 p.m.
Just show up in front of the Cockpit
at 1:00.

Tutoring Slow Learners

The Central School tutoring pro-
gram is the latest volunteer effort
undertaken by the University Fed-
eration. It is a joint school effort,
utilizing volunteers from both South-
ern Seminary and Washington and
Lee. The majority of those to be tu-
tored are slow learners. The pro-
gram involves tutoring on a one-to-
one basis for an hour a week. All
those interested should contact Bob
Pilling (463-6003) or Bob Foley
(463-6268).

Big Brothers-Big Sisters

The Rockbridge County Welfare
and Probation Offices have supplied
the University Federation with a list
of youngsters, most of whom have
committed very minor offenses, who
might need an older friend to pro-
vide guidance and stability in their
lives. Hopefully the influence of a
Big Brother or Big Sister would en-
courage this person to stay out of
juvenile delinquency.

The ages of the young people
range from 8-14. The Big
Brother or Big Sister must spend at
least three hours a week with the
youngster. Activities include playing
football or basketball with the boys
or even helping them on homework.
The common denominator, though,
is friendship with the model of an
older brother or older sister.

The program is designed to be
open-ended. The Big Brother or Big

The “Star Of America” Rises

BY J. HAGOOD ELLISON

If honesty is indeed the best pol-
icy, then certainly the Lexington
community is witnessing one of the
greatest wholesale public relations
campaigns for human morals, with
the advent of “The Star of Ameri-
ca.” This monthly newspaper incor-
porates the small town style of
numerous one-man papers but is
preaching the gospel to an interna-
tional audience.

It has already raised many eye-
brows and will, with a litle help,
raise a lot more if its editor and pub-
lisher, Dr. Edwin Pleasants con-
tinues his work. Pleasants, a former
college professor, sees the “Star” as
a “substitute for teaching”; his hopes
to impart an “honest influence either

 

Dr. Fdwin Pleasants

editor of “The

in the classroom or through the
paper” can be readily seen upon
quick persual of the first three edi-
tions.

The thin, graying professor in-
tends to “restore and enrich honor
in order to work in academic free-
dom.” Lexington is the headquarters
but his proposed scope calls for glo-
bal circulation. He hopes that by
drawing on the examples of several
prominent educators, notably Lee
and Washington. he can spread his
doctrine.

Dr. Pleasants. a 1942 graduate of
U.Va.. holds MA and Ph.D. de
grees in Spanish, has written one
Spanish novel and translated an-
other, and has taught at his alma
mater, as well as the Rutgers and

Sta of \merka”™

Columbia University. He has also
taught in Peru and Venezuela.

Regardless of one’s opinion, the
“Star of America” is a totally difl-
erent piece of journalism on the
Lexington scene. It combines rec-
ord and book reviews, Mom's apple
pie and the editor's own diary of
Dixie, all with a coating of the
honor code.

Where does the 50-year-old author
editor-publisher stand politically?
Reading his paper would only con-
fuse you, but he is eager to point out
he is “definitely a write-in candidate
for Lieutenant-Governor of Vir-
ginia.” His platform? You guessed
it—"“The Star of America.”

If you are not taking the first few
issues at full stock, Dr. Pleasants
notes that at least some people are.
Copies have been mailed to all Vir-
ginia congressmen, both senators
Gov. Holton, and a conglomeration
of notables including President Nix-
en. Emperor Hirohito of Japan and
Prince Charles of England.

When questioned as to President
Nixon's capabilities as a national
leader, Pleasants labeled the Chief
Executive “half-crook and half-try-
ing to reform. Like Lincoin, he is
weak on the honor code.”

With quick eyes refleciing a hyper
active mind that refuses to hold back
any opinions. the editor rapped out
at Women's Liberation, calling i a

casionally there are group outings

the program.

gram, please contact Bob Foley.

Handicapped Helped

Within Rockbridge County there
may be from 100 to 150 handicap-
ped children. This includes the deaf,
blind, physically handicapped and
children with speech impediments.
These children not only suffer physi-
cally from their handicaps but some
also suffer from mental blocs or psy-
chological problems.

A program is being established to
ease any psychological problems
which any of these children might
have. The University Federation is
funding a _ recreational program
which will give these children an
opportunity to get out and go places,
to develop their abilities and per-
sonalities, to establish friendships
and to have fun being themselves.

Volunteers are needed for this
program. If you are interested in do-
ing some work, you must take three
one hour training courses which will
be held sometime in the evenings
next week. The program will get un-
der way the first week in November
when training has been completed.
Call Ben Smith at 261-3601 if you
are interested.

Training School-Hospital

There are three general categories
of people who are mentally retarded:
those who cannot be helped, the
trainable, and the educable. In Lyn-
chburg, Virginia there is a Training
School and Hospital for those peo-
ple. The hospital is now overcrowd-
ed with 3000 patients, most of whom
are children. The goal of the hospi-
tal is to get the patients self-reliant
enough to leave the hospital and to
“go out into the world.”

There are work opportunities de-
signed specifically for these people
so that the patient will not be totally
lost when he gets into the main-
stream of society. Organizations such
as Goodwill Industries and the Sal-
vation Army are equipped to give
jobs to people who need some sort
of sheltered working conditions.

As was mentioned before there
are three general categories of pati-
ents. The ones with promise of im-
provement are the trainable and the
educable. A trainable person is one
who can learn to do some routine
physical task successfully such as an
assembly line-type jobs. The educ-
able person is capable of that and
also has the potential to learn to

Army Graphologist Evaluates Personality
By Analyzing Samples Of Handwriting ©

Reprinted from the October 8, 1971
edition of The Voice.

According to the men in Company
R, 3rd Battalion, Quartermaster
School Brigade at Ft. Lee, Va., who
work with PFC Stephen M. Sturm,
a word to the wise is—‘type.”

Private Sturm, a company clerk,
is an expert in graphology—the sci-
ence of handwriting analysis. By
looking at a person’s handwriting he
can delve into his personality.

Private Kelsey explained the sci-

handwritings are alike, just as no
two fingerprints are identical.

“In an attempt to evaluate the
personality from handwriting, many
studies have been conducted in
which script was analyzed into its
component elements. Each of those
elements has a specific meaning, not
only by itself, but first of all, in
correlation with other factors, There
are times when one feature may in-
dicate different personality traits and
this is when one considers this stroke

 

 

in relation to other features,

itself, wide handwriting means that
the writer is an extrovert and is soci-
able. It can also mean restlessness,
flight from one’s problems, morbid
curiosity and neurotic need for af-
fection, Thus it is as always impor-
tant to remember that a single fea-
ture can never be evaluated alone,
but always considered in relation to
the other strokes,”

To test his ability, Private Sturm
was given two samples written by a
Civil War general—one written be-
fore and the other after the war.
Private Sturm knew only that the
man lived during the Civil War era,
nothing more.

He analyzed, “Here was a far-
sighted, practical man with a spirit
of enterprise that I’m sure aided him
in whatever his endeavors were.
There was a dynamic impulse in him
combined with strong ambition and
determination to help him get what
he wanted. In fact, this is probably
his strongest characteristic. He was
fortunate enough to have the intel-
lect and mental mobility as impor-
tant means to his ends, as well as the
capacity for depth of thoughts and
abstract thinking.

“He was easily adaptable to cir-
cumstances so that in times of dras-
tic change, or perhaps when faced
with fierce competition, he would be
able to withstand whatever obstacles
he faced. | am sure that he was a
leader in his field, or that he at least
had the potential to have been one.

“On what | would consider his
negative side, I found that he was

slightly narrowminded — to

thoughts of others. He was not sen-
sitive, and his emotions certainly
were not flexible. He definitely did
not allow his emotions enough ex-
pression, and in fact, he repressed
his impulses instead of trying to un-
derstand and control them, This

Film Shows Horror And Reality

BY MARK McMINN

A crowd in excess of 200 saw
Tod Browning's 1932 film FREAKS
last Wednesday night in duPont
Auditorium.

Browning, an ex-vaudeville comic,
actor, scriptwriter and assistant to
D. W. Griffith, was responsible for
many of the films during the Thirties
dealing with the grotesque, two be-
ing DRACULA (1930) and MARK
OF THE VAMPIRE (1935).

In FREAKS, Browning's mani-
pulation of reality gives the viewer
a glimpse into another world where
physical reality is unimportant, The
acceptance of their condition as ex-
emplified by the freaks in the film is
contrasted with the inhumanity of
the normal people.

The prologue to the film tells the
viewer that in anscient times any
deviation from the so-called “nor-
mal” was indeed an evil omen. Here
Browning draws heavily on the code
of behavior among the freaks: “the
hurt of one is the hurt of all.” And

a “chicken woman,” restores reality
by turning a normal person into a
freak. —

A ban of thirty years was imposed
by the censors upon FREAKS and
only in 1962 was it lifted. Yet the
film still retains a wierd brilliance
and admiration, largely because of
Browning's conception and treat-
ment of the freaks themselves.
Browning lowers his camera to the
midget level and thereby tells the
viewer that sadism and evil lie
behind the magnificent physiques of
Cleopatra and her strong arm lover.

The simple dignity and restraint
characterized by the freaks trans-
cends their distorted appearance.
Perhaps it is this concept of human-
ity and sympathy, contrasted with
the revenge gained at the end of
the film, that enables FREAKS to
hold its own as one of the truly
great horror films of all time.

On Betrayal

BY MARC SMALL

Although the middle of the last
decade was a low tide for American
conservatives, there was a strong and
vibrant hope that united us through
the horror of the Johnson years: a

throne in a glorious crusade of truth
and virtue. And lo! it came to pass,
for we waxed mighty in 1966 and
rose to victory under the Sign of
the Slippery Richard two years later.
We rejoiced at the triumph we
thought we had achieved and were
mightily pleased in our Leader,

But three years have passed under
the guiding hand—or should one say
fist?—of President Nixon, and these
have been years in which he has
drifted, slowly but steadily, to the
left. Where is the Nixon of yester-
year? The Nixon who placed prin-
ciple above victory, and so loyally
decried the failings of the Johnson
Administration during those lean
and hungry years? Where is the Nix-
on who supported free enterprise,
the Nixon who believed so much in
individual liberty? Sometime in the
past three years Nixon the States-
man died and rose again as a politi-
cian, a Republican in name alone.

The transition has been gradual:
the Nixon of laissez-faire sentiment
still lived this past winter when he
objected to Congressional action giv-
ing him the authority to impose
wage and price controls, The Nixon
of conservative bent yet survived
last fall when he displayed such
great effort to aid the campaigns of
conservative Republicans, Yet, now
this Nixon has disappeared and we
find in his place a Nixon whose only
goal is re-election in 1972, and who
will betray every principle that the

Republican Party has held in such

with Hampden-Sydney.

There’s a mad scramble for the ball during last week’s rugby match

 

Ruggers To Face U.Va.
After 10-0 Loss To H-S

Hampden-Sydney nipped the Blue
10-0 in rugby action at Sweetbriar
Sunday, before an unusually attrac-
tive audience, Although the Blue
found their efforts to score thwarted,
they managed the most effective de-
fense yet this season, holding Ham-
pden-Sydney to one try each half (H-
§ also got one of two 2-point kick-
after-try attempts).

The ruggers troubles seem to stem
from a lack of game experience an
a disunity on the field, caused by
fielding a different combination of
men each week,

But in the “B” game the Blue
fought to a scoreless tie. And al-
though the match was played pri-
marily in the vicinity of the H-S goal
line, the Blue simply couldn't get
across for a try, Due tribute must be
paid the Hampden-Sydney defense.

The beer bash following the game
carried with it an unusual clement.

 

For possibly the first time in the his-
tory of W&L rugby, not one rugger
became drunk. Fighting their way
through the mob of Sweetbriar girls
surrounding the keg to get a sip of
brew with which to dampen the
parched throat from the chick sitting
atop the keg was just too much,
Consequently, nary a rugger had a
chance to come anywhere near in-
toxication, and the Blue rose to the
singing of the traditional songs with
a hitherto unknown sobriety.

Next Sunday, the ruggers face up
against U.Va. at 2:00 P.M. on Alum-
ni Field. It’s just the game to see to
top off the “big” weekend, A big
turn out, and, who knows, although
the game is billed by some as the
rugby counterpart of the Bucknell
football game, yes, who knows, the
Blue may get back in the old groove
and come up with a win.

Pari-Mutual Gambling

Lately, a commission made up of
several Virginia citizens appointed by
Governor Linwood Holton has been
exploring the possibilities of pari-
mutual gambling in this state. Natur-
ally, as with any political war, the
state has divided into two basic fac-
tions, not surprisingly known as the
pros and the cons.

It is not known to what extent the
gambling system shall be utilized.
Pari-mutual wagering consists of the
division of the winnings among those
who bet on the winner, with a per-
centage taken out of the gross by the
management. This form of betting is
most commonly used in horse racing
but can also be applied with equal
finesse to auto racing, football, base-
ball, basketball, and virtually any ath-
letic competition.

Proponents of the gambling system

contend that pari-mutual betting
would create a giant boost in much-
needed tax revenues, a boost which
could forestall raising other taxes.
Sources of income might be found in
licensing fees and a percentage of the
wager outlay, using the “skim-the-
ream-off the-top” concept employed
elsewhere, Those who favor the legis-
lation of betting claim that the state
should take advantage of the existing
state of affairs; the nags run in West
Virginia and Maryland, and much
Virginia money flows out of the state
and into the neighbors’ coffers. Be-
sides, the slight initial outlay would
be quickly recomponsed. In addition,
more tourist dollars might find their
way into Virginia’s treasury, especi-
ally since the weather would permit a
racing schedule as heavy as from
April to October or even into early
November.

On the other hand, many feel that
pari-mutual system is morally wrong,
a vicious wickedness which should not
penetrate into the Old Dominion.
Others argue that to allow gambling
to establish itself in the state is to
issue an engraved invitation to or-
ganized crime to operate here. The
first point is moot and subject to a
religious perspective; the second is

possible but not altogether probable.

However, an aspect of pari-mutual
betting overlooked by other states be-
fore they took the plunge should be
considered by our state’s commis-
sioners; the money that pours into
the wager system is money that might
ave been spent elsewhere. That is,
dollars which earlier were spent on
luxury items like books, a television, a
new fishing rod, or even a car will
ow be spent at the track. The subse-
vuent loss in income for the business-
man leads to increased bankruptcies,
higher unemployment, and fewer rev-
enue dollars to the state. The experi-
ence of other states is that this loss
has more than offset the gain pari-
mutual income.

Perhaps this is being mulled over
by the distinguished panel; but if pari-
mutual gambling is approved, I'm
placing my money on the probability
that next weekend will be rainy again.

CC Team Falls
In Home Meet

Washington and Lee’s Cross-Coun-
try team fell victim Saturday to
Christopher Newport College, 26-
29, dropping their record to two
wins against three losses thus far this
season.

Bill Kalal, a sophomore who has
been running the best for the team
all year, placed second in the meet
with a time of 28:41, only thirteen
seconds behind the winner, Bill Ilto
of Christopher Newport. Doug Mc-
Neel placed fourth in the meet
(29:34) with his best effort this sea-
son. Carter Glass, co-captain, finish-
ed third for the team and sixth in
the meet, followed by Harrison
Turnbull (eight) and Bob Sherwood,
also a co-captain, ninth. Each team
placed five runners in the top ten.

read, This person's stumbling block
is abstract thinking.

In order for a person to progress,
he must have some individual at-
tention and guidance. With help, a
person can learn and develop, With-
out this attention the child loses any
desire to learn and falls back into
the rut of oblivion,

The Lynchburg Training School
and Hospital is working with the
situation in the following way. They
have taken the children who have
shown the most promise, and isolat-
ed them from the other children. By
placing them in suites instead of
wards the hospital staff hopes to
make some progress. A ward is a
large open room with sometimes ten
beds in it. A suite on the other hand

usually houses about two or three
students and is more self-contained,
There are from 150-200 children
living in these suites. The hospital
wants to direct its manpower into
this area first since these are the
most promising children. Then as
these children are prepared to leave
the hospital, children from the wards
can move into the self-contained
units and hopefully be helped too.
What is needed to make this pro-
gram work is dedicated volunteers.
One member of the hospital staff
said that if Washington and Lee sent
them 1000 volunteers, he could put
them all to work immediately. Ap-
parently, there is a definite need for
more help. The volunteer would be
responsible for one child only. His
job would be to act as father, broth-

er, counselor, and most important of
all as a friend to the child.

To be effective, the volunteer must
visit his little friend at least one Sat-
urday a month, He could take him
to a movie in Lynchburg, or just
take him out for a drive in the coun-
try. If the volunteer is not constant
about going, the child, anticipating a
visit, will be depressed when he dis-
covers that his volunteer has not
come, This experience could greatly
hamper any progress the child may
have been making.

score; the Generals’ never getting on

the scoreboard.

Once again, the defense did an
excellent job, even allowing 27
points, against the big and tough
Bucknell eleven. It is easy to see
that the General's major weakness
this year has been the offense, which
has managed to score only 17 points
total in its first four games. If the
Generals are to rally this year, it
will be the offense that will have to
start moving.

probably led to his not being free or
easy going around people.

“He had a certain obvious charm
about him, however, but only on the
outside, as inwardly he was cold
thinking and intuitive. I would go so
far as to say he was even deceitful at
times. He was not an impressionable
man, and he would not bend to com-
promise. This person was authori-
tarian, cautious and extremely self-
controlled, Finally, I am not sure if
he was stingy with his money and
time, or just thrifty, but there is a
distinction here and I'm not quite
sure to which way he leaned more
strongly.

“Basically this man showed a dis-
trust of others, which may have led
to the drastic change I noted in a
sample of his writing done several
years later, In his later writing, poor
health or a psychic disorder (mental
or nervous breakdown) shows, pos-
sibly due to the fact that he was
lonely, and always had been, for
true friends he wished he had but
would not allow himself to have. Or
perhaps an unfortunate incident oc-
curred and he was getting too old to
handle the impact.”

The man was Robert E. Lee.

unofficial, however, since the two

better showing by Washington and

be attributed to the rougher course

from the Nixon ranks, there is little
hope for a conservative resurrection
next year. All the hopes and ambi-
tions that Nixon symbolized to us
in the mid-sixties have turned to
ishes in our mouths, and we are
once again at the point of defeat.
Nixon is too firmly entrenched to be
unseated at the convention unless he
should blunder far more seriously
than is probable. Yet, some of our
faith is dead, and I doubt if those of
us who gave so much in the John-
son Interregnum shall again work so
hard or devote ourselves so totally
to this particular candidate. Nixon
shall win re-election, and shall con-
tinue to operate in a manner similar
to that of his first three years—but
he shall never again have the total
commitment he once had from con-
servatives, and his  prevaricating
vacillations shall gain him a second
term only at the cost of his honor
and the sanctity of his party’s prin-
ciples,

W&L Trustee Nominated For High Court

Franklin Powell, Jr, a
Washington and
and law schools and
a member of the University’s Board
of Trustees since 1961, nomi
nated for a position on the Supreme
Court by President Nixon _ last
Thursday uight.

Nixon ended weeks of speculation
by seeking congressional approval
for nominations of Powell, 64, and
Assistant Attorney General William
Rehnquist to fill the vacancies creat
ed by the retirements of two As
sociate Justices: the late Hugo Black,
and John Harlan.

Contacted by telephone yesterday
night, Powell said he was glad to
hear from the Ring-tum Phi again.
He told an anecdote about his de
either to run for editor-in
chief of the paper or for President
of the Student Body in 1929; he
ran for President and was elected.
Mr. Powell admitted “my life is
bedlam now,” but he agreed to alter

his interview policy to talk with the

Ring-tum Phi.

We asked Powell if he would
remain a trustee of Washington and
Lee. “I will stay on the Board if
it is compatible with the canons of
judicial ethics,” Powell stated. He
explained that there had already
been a “big row” over federal judges
sitting on the boards of corporations,

Powell cited the case of former
Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas,
who had been criticized for being
on the board of directors of a
corporation that was involved in a
before the high court. Since
Powell claimed that “a number
of judges have resigned from such
boards.” Powell expressed his desire
to remain on the University Board
of Trustees, saying he would be
“most reluctant to sever my con-
nections with W&L.”

Powell added that he planned to
appear before the Senate Judiciary
Committee in a hearing soon, “I

was told the hearing would be held
November 4, and that my presence
would be required.”

The W&L graduate was asked
when he found out about his nomi
nation by President Nixon, a ques-
tion he has previously declined to
answer for the reporting press,
Powell commented to us that “dis-
cussions had been made about my
possible nomination over a two-day
period. | was officiously told a week
ago tonight” (October 19).

“This nomination couldn't have
anything but beneficial results for
the school,” University President
Robert E. R. Huntley said. “This
constitutes recognition of the out-
standing achievement of one of our
law graduates, alumni, and most
loyal supporters.”

Huntley, a law professor himself,
continued, “Powell is the epitome
of achievement in his profession, He
stands for the kind of achievement
law school graduates can aspire to.

As a Board of Trustee
Lewis has performed with the same
hard work, full intelligence and good
advice he has shown in other fields.”

“My initial reaction was selfish,”
President Huntley added, “I felt
pride in my alma mater, which is
quite healthy, At further reflection
I sent a telegram of congratulation
to President Nixon on the selection
of a man of such stature as Mr.
Powell. I think he is unsurpassed in
qualifications, it would be especially
difficult to beat his handling of
difficult questions.”

Powell is currently senior partner

in the firm of Hunton, Williams,
Gay, Powell and Gibson, which he
joined in 1937. He served abroad

during the Second World War, ris-
ing to the rank of colonel and
receiving numerous honors from
both the American and French gov-
ernments.

The W&L graduates has served on
both the Richmond Board of Educa-

member,

National Commission
and Admini-

tion and the
on Law Enforcement
stration of Justice.

He is currently President of the
American Bar Foundation and has,
in the past, headed both the Ameri-
can College of Trial Lawyers and
the American Bar Association.

Powell, who holds a Master of
Laws degree from Harvard, gradu
ated from Washington and Lee with
a B.S. in Commerce, magna cum
laude, in 1929, In 1931, he received
his LL.B., emerging with the high
est academic average in his twenty-
one man class.

The High Court nominee served

a term as Student Body President
in 1929-30, and was also assistant
editor of The Ring-tum Phi. He

was elected to both Phi Beta Kappa
and Omicron Delta Kappa, and, in
1929, he was presented the Algernon
Sydney Sullivan Medallion, as that
student “who excels in high ideals
of living, in spiritual qualities, and

in generous and disinterested service
to others.”

In 1960, Washington and Lee pre-
sented Mr. Powell with an honorary
Doctor of Laws Degree in recogni-
tion of “his generous and wise
leadership at the Bar, in civic en-
terprises, and in public service.”
The nominee holds honorary
degrees from Hampden-Sydney, Wil
liam and Mary, and the University
of Florida.

The New York Times quoted
President Nixon as praising Powell
as “a man who has accomplished
everything he has undertaken with
distinction and honor, both as a
lawyer and a citizen.”

“Lewis Powell is from Virginia,”
the Nixon quote in the Times con-
tinued, “But Lewis Powell is
recognized by his legal colleagues
throughout the nation as being a
man who represents not just Vir-
ginia and the South—he is first and
foremost a very great American.”

OuTLOOKandReview! Be

Wednesday, October 27, 1971

At the completion of rush for the last few years the
Ring-tum Phi has cast itself in the role of a grim prophet.
The prophecy espoused by this paper was the doom of the
fraternity system at Washington and Lee University. Such
a prophecy would not be quite apropos this year.

Judging from the current climate, the fraternities are not
dead. Yet, they appear to be infected with several cancers
which need treatment.

Rush itself emphasizes the numerous inadequacies of
W&L’s 15 houses. Almost any outsider who witnessed the
quad “riot” October 8 would have categorized the participants
as insane, inhumane, childish and barbaric. ABC fraternity
men were at the throats of XYZ members. Fights exploded
all across the brick courtyard. Somehow all this exuberance
seems sadly channeled. How does punching out people
prove that your house is the best? It was a wonder that some
brothers believed that their pledges were impressed, The
whole debacle was so out of hand that the university slapped
a small minority of the mob with social probation for various
offenses stich as smashing windows.

The preferential card system was run quite lackadaisically.
On Monday, October 11 freshmen were told by the Interfra-
ternity Council officials that they should fill out preferential
cards with their first, second, and third choices. The IFC did
not follow through with its end of the operation. Late that
afternoon an unmanned ballot box was placed in the fresh-
man quad, The number of cards accompanying the box was
limited, so several sheets of notebook paper were left there.
The result was that most freshmen did not complete their
preferential cards on that Monday. Actually, up until October
25 the IFC did not know for sure who had pledged for the
entire class.

Also rush seemed to drag on forever this fall. The de-
ferred system theoretically gave freshmen more time to pick
and choose among fraternities. But once again, a sizeable
portion of freshmen accepted bids to join the first evening of
rush dates. Freshmen to a large extent expressed their dis-
pleasure with the month and a half process. Upperlassmen
also quickly tired of the weekend-wrecking rush schedule.

These developments during rush form a concrete indict-
ment against the fraternities. But in the defense of the IFC
and its member fraternities, these complaints are not original,
just look back in the previously mentioned Ring-tum Phi
issues. The quad riot, a preferential card concept and delayed
rush have been criticized before.

So a defense can be raised for the fraternities. Kncourag-
ing to Greek advocates has been the pragmatic attitude taken
by the Interfraternity Council President Rob LaRue. LaRue
contends that fraternities must change. He believes that
houses can no longer depend on an influx of potential pledges.
Lakue emphasizes that freshmen now can operate vehicles,
plus have girls and liquor in their dormitory rooms. In previ-
ous years fraternities rushed hard on a triumvirate of wheels,
booze and dates. Under LaRue’s leadership the rush principles
have altered. A quick glance at the 1971 rush book will tell
you that the publication differs from those of the past. The
IFC rush book is not giving individual fraternities an op-
portunity to boast of their assets, as much as it is trying to
sell the fraternity system as a whole.

Despite all this criticism, some other aspects of rush were
encouraging. More freshmen participated in rush this year
than last year. The decline in pledging seems to be leveling
off, evidenced by approximately 61 per cent of the freshmen
class pledging. And that figure may increase. The phenomea
of increased pledging, combined with a trend of declining
depledging, may spell a more realistic percentage of men in
fraternities at Washington and Lee,

The fraternity system at W&L is not dying. However,
a look at rush amplifies the tremendous problems of the
Greek system. W&L continues to need the fraternities in a
very real sense. The various houses provide sleeping quarters
for many students and feed even a larger number of men
\lso the fraternities continue to be the keystone of social
life on campus. The university could not handle the obliga
tion of providing these services, currently rendered by the
fraternities. But if the fraternities want to Improve their lot,
they must act as a unit. Fifteen, feuding fraternities acting
individually will accomplish little. For a start some houses
would do well to listen to and learn from their IFC President
and seek some pragmatic solutions to their common problems

Editor’s note: Dr. William Bu-
chanan, W&L professor of Poli-
tics, is on leave during 1971-72
and is doing research in Belfast,
Northern Ireland. A former Edi-
tor of The Ring-tum Phi, he was
asked to comment on the current
‘situation there.

The first striking thing on the Bel-
fast scene is how easy it is to
disrupt the life of a major city
by determined sporadic violence on
the part of a few people—how easy
it is to do, but how hard to have
any political effect. The IRA activists
probably consist of a few thousand
persons (nobody really knows), al-
though a great many more are sym-
pathetic to them and even more
are intimidated by them.

Their objective is to bring the
center of Belfast to a halt by
Christmas by random bombing.
They may well succeed before that
time. Streets are far from empty,
but business is off 20 per cent in
the stores and 30 per cent in the
pubs, due as much to bomb scares
which require them to be emptied,
every threat being a credible one,
as to the actual bombs, The effect
is to make every trip of mine down-
town a minimal one.

The U.S. consulate had all its
front windows blown out from a
bomb in a police station across the
street. The bank where I have my
account had all its back windows
blown by a bomb in a parking lot
across the alley, and only the spun-
glass curtains prevented injury to
the clerks from flying glass. When
it came time for a check-up on
my new VW, I was advised to stay
away from one dealer, who was
in the Falls Road and had been hit
once; the other had so much work
as a result that he couldn't take me
for a month; so I drove out to a
town about 20 miles away for the
job.

We hear one or two explosions al-
most every night. The loudest last
week was a couple of blocks away,
in a bank next to where we buy
the daily paper. It injured two pass-
ers-by and blew the windows out
of the launderette where we leave
our washing.

Since 1 started to write this, 1
have marched downstairs and stood
on the campus with everybody else
in the social science building for a
brief drill. A security guard at the
entrance checks everybody as we
enter the building. (incidentally, the
Political Science department is in a
beautiful new building, dedicated a
year or two ago by Her Majesty,
and featuring these large areas of
glass characteristic of modern offices.
1 could do without the glass.)

The army is in evidence, mostly
patrolling the streets in Land Rovers,
one soldier facing forward, the other
back, with guns at ready. On the
way home the other day I saw one
in front of a nearby chemist's shop
(drug store), facing the street, gun
in hand. It turned out that there
was nothing more serious than that
his partner needed an aspirin, but
they must go in pairs with one on
guard when the other is preoc-
cupied.

Now the point of all this is that
with the vast amount of nuisance
it causes, and the enormous financial
loss to businessmen and to workers
who are laid off, many things go

last Situatio

on quite as usual because there
really isn’t much else one can do.
By noon the next day a very
efficient team from the city has
moved in and boarded up the win-
dows, and by the following week,
glass is usually back in and the
frames painted. Since the targets are
random, we are about as safe one
place as another. Aside from avoid-
ing the central city at night and
losing opportunities for theatre, din-
ing out and so on, people go on
about their business.

Life must be hellish for those in
the barricaded areas, with rock-
throwing, sniping, searches, and
women beating garbage can lids—
and children wandering though it
all—but I can’t describe that first
hand, and you probably see it on
TV as clearly as I do. These are
the people closest to the IRA
in sympathy. The rest of the city
goes on, far from normally and with
huge financial losses, but still effecti-
vely. | am reminded of the Strategic
Bombing surveys afer the Second
World War which staggered the Air
Force by showing how little effect
on production the truly disastrous
bombing of the cities had achieved.

The greatest nuisance at the mo-
ment is the water shortage. House-
hold water is cut off from 8 a.m.
to 8 p.m. We have a storage tank
in the attic which tides us over
if we don’t flush the toilets too often.
The shortage is due to the weather,
not the bombers, but they cooperat-
ed by blowing up a storage reservoir,
letting a few days supply run down
the gutter, and making one section
of the city dependent on tank trucks.

The almost instinctive approach of
an American political scientist to the
situation is: how can a_ solution,
or a compromise or an adjustment
between two sides be reached? The
answer is quite simple: it can’t. The
IRA is split into two groups, one
Marxist, the other reactionary;
neither recognizes the other and
neither will negotiate with the gov-
ernment, since they contend, as they
have for 50 years, that the govern-
ment of Northern Ireland is illegiti-
mate. There is a group of Social
Democrats in Parliament who are
fairly representative of the Catholic
community, but they refuse to ne-
gotiate with the government until
the 200 persons the government in-
terned (apparently a mixed bag of
genuinely dangerous gunmen and
elderly IRA has-beens) are released.

The moderates on the Protestant
side—the government—say they will
release the internees when the bomb-
ings stop, but of course the Catholic
moderates, with whom they would
negotiate, can't control the bombers.
The Protestant extremists—Paisley
and his cohorts—say the government
is being too lenient, and should
intern even more people, At the
moment Paisley appears to be efecti-
vely holding in check his red-neck
followers in the Shankill road, who
would like to move into the Catholic
area and conduct a real massacre,
and apparently have the guns to
do it. If this were to happen, the
only defense the Catholics would
have would be the IRA, so they
can't afford to discourage them.

The reason the Protestant es-
tremists are holding their followers
back is that they believe the IRA
is trying to provide them into overt

aggression. If they can bring down
the moderate government and take
their places, they might manage to
conduct their pogrom legally. So
Paisley and his M., P.’s have moved
across the aisle to sit on the op-
position bench which the Catholic
moderates vacated when they decid-

the Faulkner government can prob-
ably maintain a majority without

wing supporters that they wouldn't

By LEX McMILLAN

In the Washington Post on Octo-
ber 18 was an article which was a
follow-up of a story run about two
weeks ago. Briefly the story was
that on October 4, 1971 a man
by the name of George M. Giffe
kidnapped his estranged wife and
with the aid of a friend hijacked a
privately owned plane and ordered
the pilot to take him to the Ba-
hamas. Well naturally the pilot was
pretty co-operative since he had a
45-caliber automatic rammed into
the back of his neck.

However. he didn’t have enough
fuel to get him from Nashville,
their point of departure, to the Ba-
hamas. He therefore made arrange-
ments to stop in Jacksonville. The
FBI was notified and was there wait-
ing. The news story of October 4
simply said the outcome was that
Gifle flipped out and shot the pilot,
his wife and then himself. All three
died,

The story of October 18 throws
a good bit more light on the story
and the reason for the deaths. In
fact the FBI shares a large part
of the responsibility for the deaths
beeause of their irresponsible “cops
and robbers” bravado and attempted
daring.

What the Pest obtained that shows
the FBI's inexcusable action is the
transcript of the communications
between the pilot and the control
tower. This transcript shows that
the pilot was led to believe that fuel
would be provided and cooperation
would be the tone of the handling
of the affair. However, when he
landed he was instructed to taxi over
to a hanger and wait, He saw no
fuel truck and asked about this.
He was put off until finally the FBI

 

“How were the ‘Chambers Brothers’ 7”

“Letting Go”

n Described

This is of course a vast over-
simplification, since it ignores the
pieces of the action held by the
British army, the British govern-
ment, the Eire government, the Ca-
tholic church, the Orange order, the
American groups which are supply-
ing money for gelignite (as they
have done for a century) and
Bernadette Devlin (who attracts
much less attention here than she
does in the U.S.) But it is enough
to indicate why the assumption that
something might be done, or that
the situation might get untangled, is
considered the most naive American
optimism.

   

 

took over the radio and informed
him that no fuel would be provided,

The last words of the transcript
provide a poignant indictment of
the federal agents who handled the
affair, Pilot: “This is 58 November
(plane's code name). Uh, this gentle-
man has about 12.5 pounds of
plastic explosives back here and. . .
uh, I got no... uh, yen to join
it right now so I would please
expr... uh, appreciate if you
would stay away from this air-
plane.” Downs, the pilot, then was
informed by an FBI agent that there
would be no fuel. His reaction was
fear and supplication for a reversal
of this decision. Pilot: “Uh (gasp),
look, I don’t think this fellow’s kid-
ding—I wish you'd get the fuel truck
out here.” Tower: “58 November,
There will be no fuel. I repeat.
There will be no fuel.” Pilot: “This
is 58 November, You are endanger-
ing lives by doing this, and, uh, we
have no other choice but to go along
and, uh, uh, for the sake of some
lives we request some fuel out here,
please.”

Well the FBI refused and the
outcome was that Giffe panicked
and committed the two murders
and then suicide, But that’s o.k.
because the FBI got their man.
Hooray! Of course 1 know they
would have prefered a live capture
and no dead innocents. Those dead
innocents are such gosh awful P.R.
Heard on the FAA tape recording
of the communications was the com-
ment, “you can't win ‘em all.” And
with that sage philosophical com-
ment I suppose our heroes mounted
their horses, reholstered their 6 guns
and sauntered off into the sunset.

The absolute lack of reason in
those three deaths is physically sick-
ening. It makes one begin to ponder
the type of man that must be an
FBI agent. | personally get an
image of an individual who can't
seem to find enough excitement in
life as it is today so he wants to
do some kind of “adventurous”
work, Now there are several options
open to this soldier of fortune
type. He could join the army and
kill little yellow people. Of course
that’s not exactly popular right now
and besides there doesn't seem to be
a very promising future in it
Though the FBI is under consider.
able attack at this time, it is still
a pretty staid institution and there
aren't any concrete indications tha
it's going to disappear soon.

The real lesson to be learned fron
the needless deaths at Jacksonvill
is the absolutely crucial need fo
gun control laws in America, | use
to have mixed emotions about con
trolling the possession of guns, |
seems that a gun in every home |
one of the sacred historical birt
rights of every American. Howeve
most of us don't go out inio th
wilderness daily and round up suj
per by hunting and gathering.

We have gotten to the point th:
we need to have laws just as stri
as in England. They have a fair
eflicient system over there and tl
figures show that the searceness |
gues has brought their crime ra
and death and injury by guns dow
In short, part of the cause of vi
ence in America is the case wi
which it is accomplished

It might be overly ilealistic

By STEPHEN C, WOODRUFF

‘ a mixture of disparate,
unrelated subject matter, an eucrasy
of junk, an alloyage of garbage, a
miscellany of musings, a hodgepodge
of belief, a hotchpotch of idle
thoughts . . . That’s potpourri (no
question about that), and that’s what
this is.

Note that it took me four issues
to get this mess together (and prob-
ably another four to get it printed);
use that to judge as you will its
quality, There are at least two
Why ...

Unheeded parietals live on, while
the dorm resident never does know
when it is safe to go take a shower...

If Cottier has nothing better to
rat about than the unusual liason
between the management of the Co-
op and the upper echelon of the
Nixon administration, maybe he
should look into the strange simi-
larity in body design of the Ford
Pinto and the Chevrolet Vega.

Student Body President Steve
Robinson redefines Honor System as
“atmosphere of trust”. . . . Items
vanish from Co-op . . . Books dis-
appear from McCormick, Bookstore

. University Center Committee
has members do guard duty at
dances .. . Evans Dinning Hall has
pictured ID cards made up for
contract students . Instructor
feels he cannot define what he
expects on “pledged” homework . . .
Money disappears from open gym
locker . . . The Honor System is
alive and thriving at W&L. Or is it?

Ah, yes . . . | almost forgot
the single item that was my inspira-
tion to write this in the first place
. . « What evil lurks in the strange
area of the basement of Washington
Annex II? Word has it (although
through a most  undependable
source) that not even the president
of this university really knows what
takes place there. And, of course,
the author of all this scandalous
commentary never bothered to ask
him (or anyone else who might
know, for that matter), all in the
interest of good journalism. But
speculation, even professed knowl-
edge, concerning its function
abounds . . .

. naturally, all of the unusual
and unknown here is incorporated
into the clandistine atmosphere sur-
rounding the double-locked door and
the bricked-up windows . . . For
instance, why is it that snow is
never present but always melts on
the walk connecting Washington
Hall and Washington Annex I??.. .
And what of the mass of electrical
cables entering the computer center,
when an IBM 1130 can run on
house current? . . . and the strange
pipes that leave and re-enter the
basement? . . . And, better yet,
what about those four enormous
fans that seem to serve no function
other than to blow air at those
mysterious pipes? ...7? Or,...
why don't they tear down the old
furnace building on the back
campus???

But enough of the unknown, what
of the scholarly efforts to put all
the puzzle pieces together? Spies
have gathered information on the
coming and going of personnel, have
studied the physical aspects of the
building in question, and have even
made efforts to trace the electrical
cables (who says they have to be
incoming power cables) to the
ROTC building or the basements
of the freshman dorms. Other data

Miscellany Of Musings:

has undoubtedly been collected,

Word has it that the building
serves a national security function,
(but that is a boring hypothesis and
engages little discussion), Others
claim it and the old furnace build-
ing serve as entrances to a cavern
beneath the colonade and Lee
Chapel... They attest to the pres-
ence of an underground network
of electronic cables and devices . . .
Proponents of this theory hold that
the basement of Washington Annex
IL houses equipment to control the
environment within the cavern.

Speculation as to the function of
the cavern is not in dearth, either. . .
Word again has it that the Consti-
tution was kept there during the
war (this is an almost universally
accepted belief, although nobody
seems to know which Constitution
or which war,).

Being (like Lex MeMillan) not
inclined toward paranoia, I won't
venture to claim or even suggest

or speculate that the freshman-dorms
are bugged or that we are victims
of a diabolical plan to control men’s
minds . .

In response to Mr. Small’s  be-
wailment of the academic situation
... Yes, “crib” courses are many,
and most of us know which they
are. And yes, many do seek them
out. But . » such courses and
people exist everywhere . . . and
do additional graduation: require-
ments “challenge” an individual, do
they add to his store of ‘useful
knowledge on his departure from
this institution, do they permit him
to follow his field of special interest
to any real height? Perhaps, prob-
ably not. The value of an education
can only be dependent upon what
the individual will let it become.
Some do not hunt out “crib”
courses. There’s a lot to be learned.

Very seriously — while in that
vein—I must commend the EC this

Selection Method Being
Challenged In Court

By JOHN F, ZINK

The methods used by the national
political parties to choose delegates
for the national conventions, to be
held next year, are being challenged
in court and may be changed by the
Supreme Court.

The situation involves’ the applica-
tion of the Supreme ‘Court’s “one
person, one vote” doctrine; the out-
come of which will ‘affect the politi-
cal power of the ‘states in the con-
ventions. Any ruling by the Supreme
Court could determine, to a great
extent, who will be nominated dur-
ing the conventions,

In the past, the method of dele-
gate selection has been determined
by a plan devised by each party
at its national convention. The plan,
to take effect for the next conven-
tion, is generally based on a “pro-
portional-representation” basis, The
plan, which is to be administered
by the party’s national committee, is
fixed and is unchangeable until the
next convention.

Two lawsuits have caused the
court action. One is sponsored by a
group of “liberal” Democrats, while
the other is sponsored by the State
of Georgia and was issued while
Lester’ Maddox was Governor in
1970.

The law suit brought by the State
of Georgia asks that the number of

» delegates be determined by the pop-

ulation of the state. This would
be the “one person, one vote” rule
and would give the Southern states
the power to dominate next year’s
Democratic convention. The plan
proposed by the “liberal” Democrats
calls for a “one Democrat, one vote”
rule in determining the number of
delegates allocated to each state.
Meanwhile, the Democratic National
Committee opposes these actions and
maintains that its present plan is
quite adequate.

The three plans for the seating of
Democratic delegations, as reported
in “U. Ss News & World Report,”
are as follows: Democratic National
Committee Plan, number of «dele-
gates is to be determined by a
formula which is based on a states
population as well as the number
of Demoeratic voters in the -past
three presidential elections, “Liberal”
Democratic Plan, number of dele-
gates to be determined by the Demo-
cratic vote in a state in the recent
presidential elections. Georgia's
Plan, number of delegates would be
determined by the total population
of a state without regard to. party
affiliation.

Joseph A. Califano, Jr. general
counsel for ‘the*Demoeratie National
Committee was quoted in “U.S,
News & World Report” as saying,
“the Supreme Court could wind up
in dictating the delegates to both
national conventions next year.”

W&L Captures First Win
As W. Maryland Falls 14-7

Awesome Rushing Game
Balances Attack; Purser
Totals 130 on 24 Rushes

By LEWIS HIXSON

The Generals must have
pleased with the homecoming
tion at halftime because they
out of the dressing room to
a touchdown and break a 7-7 tie
in winning their first game of the
season, Yes, on this rain soaked
Saturday before a good homecoming
crowd the W&L Generals defeated
the Green Terror of Western Mary-
land by a score of 14-7 to erase the
zero in the win column.

If one had to pick out a hero
in this game, it would have to be
Lat Purser. He came into the game
in the second quarter to run for
130 yards on 24 carries and scored
one touchdown. Steve Fluharty was
unable to use the pass effectively
due to the rain so he stayed on the
ground, using the ability of his back-
field to grind out 227 yards rush-
ing. Because of this, the Blue con-
trolled a majority of the time on
the clock and gave the defense add-
ed rest. The defense reciprocated in
allowing the Green Terror only one
touchdown in the first quarter.

he first score in the game came
after an interception of a Fluharty
pass by Orndorff of Western Mary-
land. With the ball on the Western
Maryland 44, on the first play from
scrimmage, Brockmeyer swept right
end for 56 yards and a touchdown,
The point after was good and with

been
selec-
came
score

11:12 left in the half, Western

Maryland led 7-0.

Back came W&L after Purser re-
turned the kickoff 26 yards to his
own 33. Getting all of the yardage
on the ground, the Generals moved
down for the score in 13 plays.
Purser carried the ball 9 times for 51
yards in the drive before Fluharty
went over for the score from the
one. Doug Chase added the extra
point and with 7:05 remaining in
the half, it was 7-7. That terminated
the scoring in the first half.

In the third quarter W&L got the
ball at the Western Maryland 47
after a Yates punt, Once again, gain-
ing all of the yardage on the ground,
the Blue marched for a touchdown
in nine plays. Again, it was Purser
who was the workhorse of the opera-
tion. He gained 29 yards in five
carries and also went in for the score
from five yards out. The score came
with 49 seconds left in the third
quarter and with the addition of the
PAT the scoreboard read 14 to 7
in favor of the Generals.

Neither team was able to move
the ball in the fourth quarter. The
only threat coming on a fumble
by Purser at the W&L 42. The
Green Terror managed to make one
first down moving the ball to the
W&L 25 before Bill Wallace in-
tercepted a Bricker pass at the 23
and returned it 14 yards to the 37
The game ended with W&L on the
right end of the scoreboard by a
14 to 7 count.

The Generals should be up after
this win and they will have to stay
up if they are going to beat Sewanee
next week. Sewanee has a tough

team and a reputation of being
unbeatable at their home field, where
the game will be played, this Satur-
day. The remainder of the Gen-
erals’ schedule looks awesome with
three CAC opponents yet to come
and a lopsided tilt with Coast Guard.

Booters Capture

Third Victory

The W&L soccer team traveled to
Williamsburg last week to meet a
William and Mary squad that was
tough, Away came the  booters
though with an easy 3-2 victory that
improved their season’s record to
3-4.

Two of the General's scores came
in the first quarter as the booters
commanded the game early, Rolfe Fr",
Piranian headed the first score and ©. & _r
Mike Shaffer soon added another
goal on a left-footed goal mouth
shot. William and Mary could not

Ruggers Crush
Virginia, 19-6

If going out on a limb and main-
taining the possible win against
seemingly formidable odds, as was
done in this space last week, gives
the W&L Rugby Club the needed
edge, | should follow up and do the
same for the NC State game to be
played there this Halloween (Sun-
day). Of course, last week’s com-
ments didn’t bring the additional
support they solicited, just good
rugby. And, unfortunately, there is
no real evidence that it was the
words printed here that brought the
win. Perhaps it was the new jerseys.

But enough of the mystical power
of words appearing in this paper.
Yes, the rumors you have heard
are true, W&L did defeat U.Va. in
rugby competition on Alumni Field
Sunday. And it was the ruggers
who won it, no words, great or
small, regardless of where they ap-
peared, spoken or printed.

Boasting an incredible defense
and a strong scrum, the Blue
fought their way through a score-
less first half. Pursuit and good
tackling was the key to stopping
U.Va.’s always powerful offense. The
U.Va. offense was quick and handl-
ed the ball well.

At the beginning of the second
half, the word was out among the
WAL ruggers, “hit ‘em hard here,
early, The game’s going to be won
or lost in the first five minutes of
this half.” Things looked tough at
the outset, as U.Va. gained pos-
session of the ball near the W&L
goal line only seconds into the half.
For a few brief minutes (or were
they hours), the Blue held a tre-
mendous goal line defense, and fin-
ally a W&L kick placed the ball
well down field, and the Blue were
out of trouble, For a time, the ball

| have not had the opportunity
to check-out the National Collegiate
Athletic Association’s new playoff
plan for football, but judging from
the internal resistance which the an-
nouncement involved, it will be three
or four years before the idea will
become reality . . while the
Pittsburgh Pirates played — like
champs in the World Series, they
have otherwise with their winnings

to give their grounds crew a share
because the groundskeepers  sup-
ported an umpire’s strike before last

Week for his job in directing the
Chiefs to a second half comeback
victory over the previously unbeaten
Washington Ramskins. . . . And
when is the last time you saw so
many high scoring ball games? .. .
Some of these scores sound like

21, 75-28, 60-21, and 70-6 just some
of the lopsided margins which
graced this week’s sports pages... .
it’s shaping up to be quite a horse-
race early between Cornell’s Ed
Marinaro and Oklahoma’s Greg
Pruitt as the pair of jockeys for the
Heismann Trophy honors . .

Marinaro is closing in on Steve
Owen's NCAA career rushing rec-

ord, lacking only seven yards with —

four games left, while Pruitt has led

Colorado . . . . Despite Washington's
loss Sunday, the ‘Skins’ still are the
team to beat in the National Con-

Neither Dallas nor New York pose
insurmountable images . . . . For
those of you who might be wonder-

Basketball

Turnout

Impresses Canfield

W&L basketball is in full swing
with coach Verne Canfield’s team
looking to improve last year’s 17-8
record.

Twenty-one candidates turned out
for the start of practice, among
them, ten letermen, all of whom
started at least one game. Canfield
was pleased with the turnout but
complained that he had to cut some
fine players, “It’s good for the pro-
gram but it’s tough to tell a good
kid he can’t make it.”

Among the returning players is
senior captain Mike Daniels, who
should move into the third spot in
career scoring at W&L. A strong
corps of guards returns with Hatton
Smith, Doug Clelan, Ellie Gutshall
and Charlie Strain. Paul McClure,
Bob Pop, Dave Stone and John
Glace will help out underneath.
Scott Wood, a senior who played
freshman ball, is back to help out
in the backcourt.

Canfield is also pleased with what
he calls “the best group of fresh-
men in the past five years.” Stand-
outs among the freshmen include
Guy Kerr, Boman Williams, and
Stu Nibley.

Canfield stressed that he will not
have a set starting five. “We like
to play a lot of people,” said the
coach. “We like to get people to
feel like they’re contributing to the

Thus Canfield feels that this year’s
team is better than last year’s, but
that their overall performance will
depend on “how fast the kid’s get
together,”

Canfield’s team in recent years
have depended on a controlled style
of play and the scoring of the big
men. This year’s team will run and
press more, resulting in what Can-
field calls “a more exciting and
open game.” Quickness and speed
will make up for a general lack of
height.

The Generals open the season on
Dec. 1 against U.Va., one of their
toughest opponents, in the new gym.
Their will be 16 home games, in-
cluding the annual W&L Invitational
Tournament and the C.A.C, Tourna-
ment. There will be a frosh game
before most of the home games.

cg * Eo

B-ball notes:

Over the past five years, Canfield’s
teams have won better than 68%
of their games, making hime one of
the winningest coaches in W&L his-
tory.

Students will be allowed to play on
the new courts, despite rumors to
the contrary. Coach Canfield said
there was never any plan to bar
students from the new gym, add-
ing that such a move would be

Spong Gives Convention Keynote

(Continued from page 1)
people running as delegates be elimi-
nated, to allow. better qualified
people, who could not previously
afford the luxury, to run for that
position,

Spong also cited the need for
reform in the field of campaign
costs, He hypothesized that candi-
dates are actually involved in two
campaigns, one wit hthe voters and
campaigns, one with the voters and
jected the spending of 400 million
dollars in 1972, and he warned of
the danger of this increased spend-
ing.

“It's approaching the point where
an independent may be barred from
public office” because of his in-
ability to muster up the necessary
campaign funds, the senator noted,
He also alluded to the fact that
a large donor, such as a big business,
would force the candidate to take
up its issues rather than those of
the people.

He then proposed that campaign
expenditures be publicly reported to
bring campaign spending under con-
trol. He suggested that disclosure
of financial connections, both pub-
lic and private, would help put
campaigning into a feasible position
for any serious candidate wishing to
run for office.

The native of Portsmouth then
expressed his greatest disappointment
in Congress thus far—its “failure
of reform of the Electoral College.”
He proposed an exit of the “faith-
less slector,” who casts his vote as
he pleases, not necessarily in ac-
cordance to his state’s wishes. He
also proposed a new voting system

mount any attack and they played
the majority of the first half in their
goal area. The poor field conditions,
pot holes and torn turf along with
mud, hampered both teams consid-
erably.

The last W&L score was a goal
mouth shot by Jim Fox. With a
comfortable 3-0 lead, the Generals
settled down and a roused William
and Mary team converted two quick
goals in the early fourth quarter.
This was the only slack the Generals
hit as the entire team added their
abilities to the cause. If anyone can
be singled out, it would be captain
Meade Kampmueller for his leader-
ship.

This Wednesday afternoon ai the
Liberty Hall field the Generals meet
the Keydets of VMI. On Saturday,
the Midshipman, ranked fourth na-
tionally, play host to W&L at An-
napolis,

which would combine the popular
vote with the electoral vote in de-
termining the president.

He concluded that all of these
reforms are necessary in today’s
political scene. Spong ended his
speech by noting that these reforms
“will enhance public trust of the
integrity of those who make and
administer the law.”

Spong then entertained questions
from the audience. Some of the
major points of discussion, and his
views, are as follows:

Supreme Court nominations:
Spong feels that Lewis Powell will
be confirmed with little trouble, but
he labelled himself unqualified at
the time to make any predictions on
William Rehnquist.

Third parties in 1972: The senator
expressed the distinct possibility of
third and possible fourth — party
movements next year, especially if
certain factions of the Democratic
party are not appeased by the
nomination of that party.

The draft: The speaker seriously
doubted if the needs of security
could be met by an_ all-volunteer
army at this time. He personally
supported a one-year extension of
the draft rather than the two-year
form which was passed, He cited
cost of, and divisiveness over, the
war as prime factors in the future
of the draft,

only by their extensive advertising
which proclaimed “the cheapest
prices” among the towns’ eight sta-
tions. Although their prices are less
than most stations within the city-
limit, they hope to draw on the
large student clientele, now pur-
chasing from the fixed-price mer-
chants,

Ihe idea for the station grew out
of the four roommates’ need for a
garage to rebuild and work on
motorcyles. They approached Hamm
about renting the garage portion for
their workshop. He in turn pro-
posed they take over the entire
operation of the then dormant sta-
tion. After a week's deliberation,
they jumped into the business with
all the high-hopes of any young
businessman. After only two weeks
they have “cleared” all their initial
investment.

They have purposely lowered their
prices hoping to attract students,
Thus far, however, most of their
business has come from tourists.
With the end of the price war in
scenic Buena Vista, they anticipate
increased sales.

chines are affecting the jurisdiction
of the Honor System.

“If | were a student from some
high school visiting W&L and was
told how well the Honor System
worked here,” said Secretary Rick
Gray, “if the first thing I was asked
was for an ID card in the Dining
Hall, | might have some doubts,”

JoJo Martin moved that the
present discussion be tabled until
the following week and that, in the
meantime, a poll be conducted to
determine the desire of students who
eat in Evans Hall to remove the
machine procedure. There was some
debate as to whether or not a poll
of this nature was germane to the
central question, i.c., whether the -
machines effectively serve as a de-
triment to the Honor System. The
motion ultimately passed, 5-4, with
one abstention.

The final topic of the evening was
the annual Honor System survey.
Steve Robinson, President, asked
whether or not the EC felt that a
survey at this time was necessary,
and if so, in what form, Rick Gray
doubted “how many people sincerely
answer “such surveys, citing the poor
response of students to last year’s

survey.
It was stiggested that students
could conceivably be bombarded

with surveys this year, and the EC
decided to table the question until
“it can be determined if the poll
is really needed.”

Honest man will work for room and
board with another from Nov. 1.

University Council met last
night and discussion cen-
parietals, freshman regis-

Committees, the need for a

University Ombudman to act as a

go-between for students and the

University, and the apparent ten-
n between white and black stu-

at W and L.
. T. C. Imesen reported that
the Student Affairs Committee had
met and had removed parietal regu-
lations from the Law and Upper-
class dormitories. The committee
also interviewed counselors and re-
viewed polls from freshmen; at the
next meeting, the S.A.C. will inter-
view freshman class officers in order
to further explore the possibility of
abolishing parietals in the freshman
dormitories.

Freshman University Council Re-
presentative Bob Keatley said fresh-
man officers and representatives
from each section had met before
Thursday's meeting and that the
“general consensus was that each
dorm section should establish its
own limits concerning social rules,
A consensus preferred that parietals
be removed.”

The current registration system
for freshmen demands that they reg-
ister for all three terms in the fall of
their freshman year. There was
strong sentiment on the UC that
freshmen should be allowed a term-
by-term registration rather than the
full-year registration that now exists.

Dr. Evans then opened discussion
on an ombudsman for the Univer-
sity. He recommended a student-se-
lected faculty member for the post,
who would act as an advertised
dividual to “look into student prob-
lems.” Rob Schatz commented that:

. (such an ombudman) presents
a challenge to the faculty members
by taking away their authority or
sovereignty.”

Dr. E. L. Pinney noted that: “His-
torically, the Swedish Ombudsman
went about setting right certain grie-
vances. The ombudsman soon found
that he was occupied with trivial
matters. It seems to me this kind of
man, requires great ability, so as
not to become engulfed in trivial af-
fairs.”

The tone of these sessions is to be
informal, according to Gerald Poud
rier, the weekend's director, and
while parents are requested to attend
the Seminar group assigned, they
should feel free to come and go as
they wish, and to ask whatever ques-
tions they feel are important.

Following the seminars and the
Report to Parents, guests may attend
the Parents’ Luncheon in Evans Din-
ing Hall. Tickets for the Luncheon
are $1.75 per person and may be
purchased at the Registration Desk.

At 2:00 p.m. on Wilson Field,
Washington and Lee’s Football Gen-

A wide-range of extracurricular
activities will also be presented to
the parents. In addition to the de
bate, parents may take in a concert

The final discussion of the even-

Dr. Imeson said that the SAC had

two or three hours about their prob-
lems. He anticipated that “The solu-

Dean John agreed that . ten-

‘A Lawyer Looks at Ci

Ed. note. The following excerpts
from an article by Lewis F. Powell
Jr., W&L’s Supreme Court nominee,
were first presented on April 16,
1966, as the annual John Randolph
Tucker Law Lecture at W&L. They
indicate not only the superlative
quality and breadth of his legal
scholarship and of his analytical and
expository abilities, but also in a
substantive sense it clearly demon-
strates his commitment to justice,
particularly to racial justice, and to
the equal application of the law to
black and white alike,

BY LEWIS F. POWELL, JR.

We have witnessed, over the past
decade, the rise of a heresy which
could weaken the foundations of our
system of government, and make
impossible the existence of the hu-
man freedoms it strives to protect.
This is known as the doctrine of civil
disobedience. Its basic approach is
that the ancient justification for re-
volt against tyranny can somehow
be transmuted into a rule for day to
day life under a system of govern-
ment under the law. Putting the old
wine of revolution into the new
wineskin of constitutional govern-
ment, it argues appealingly that:
some laws are “just” and others “un-
just’; that each person may deter-
mine for himself, in accordance with
his own conscience, which laws are
“unjust”; and that each is free to
violate the “unjust” laws—provided
he does so peacefully.

The doctrine of civil disobedience
has been associated with the civil
rights movement, and for this reason
it has gained a wide and respectable
following. One would have supposed
that lawyers, trained in logic, and
the guardians of our legal system,
would have rallied promptly to de-
nounce civil disobedience as funda-
mentally inconsistent with the rule of
law. Yet most lawyers have remain-
ed silent, and of the few who have
expressed opinions a surprising num-
ber have written in justification. .. .

Most of what has been said and
written on this subject has related to

civil rights. This has inevitably
clouded perspective and prevented
dispassionate analysis. If it were

possible | would like. for the pur-
pose of this paper, to disassociate
civil disobedience from civil rights
and consider the doctrine solely on
its merits. Despite the fashion to the
contrary, one may understand and
condemn—as | certainly do—the in-
justices which initially provoked civil
disobedience without condoning or
approving a concept which in the
end could produce even greater in-
justices.

It is true that the Negro has had.
until recent years, little reason to re-
spect the law. The entire legal pro-
cess, from the police and sheriff to
the citizens who serve on juries. has
too often applied a double standard
of justice. Even some of the courts
at lower levels have failed to admini
ster equal justice. Although by no

means confined to the southern
states, these conditions—because of
the history, economic and social

structure of that region, and its pop
ulation mix—have been a way of
life in some parts of the South
Many lawyers. conforming to the
mores of their communities, have
generally tolerated all of this. often
with little consciousness of their
duty as officers of the courts. And
when lawyers have been needed to
represent defendants in civil right
cases, far too few have respond
cd

These conditions, which have sul
lied ovr proud boast of equal jus
tice tinder the law, set the stage for
the civil rights movement. Engrafted
thereon——both as a slogan
justification of tactics——was the
cept of civil disobedience. Articulat
ed by Martin Luther King in his
much publicized Letter from a Bir

and a

con

mingham Jail, this quickly gained
nationwide attention and support
outside of the South. It met the

needs of intellectuals and theologians
for a moral and philosophical justi
feation of conduct which, by all pre

and to civil disobedience as a con

cept of general applicability

Nebuchadnezzar to the Boston Tea
Party and the American Revolution.
There have been many situations
in history where the tyranny of
regime has justified revolution .
The chances of success may be re-
mote—as the Freedom Fighters
found in Hungary—but few would
deny the moral right of a people to
overthrow tyrannical rule where no
other means of redress are available.
The American colonists were in that

position, and the product of their
courage is our present system of
government,

But the irrelevance of this type of
revolution as a precedent or moral

justification for civil disobedience
must be apparent, even to most of
those who rely on it. There is no

parallel situation in America today
where, despite some conditions of in-
justice, wrongs can be and ultimately
are redressed in the courts, the legis-
latures and through other established
political institutions, It must be re-
membered that revolution, conceptu-
ally and in fact, is outside of and
designed to supplant the existing
governmental system.

Henry David Thoreau and Gandhi
are relied upon as the modern in-
spiration and authority for civil dis-

obedience. One may wonder how
many of those who cite Thoreau
have actually read him Thor-

eau’s political philosophy is simply
a doctrine of anarchy.

Nor is Gandhi's heroic struggle
for India’s independence an_intel-
lectually honest precedent for civil
disodedience in America today. In-
dia was a colony, and Gandhi was
forced to use techniques of disobedi-
ence as democratic processes and
lawful remedies were wholly un-
available.

American precedents loosely in-
voked as justification for civil dis-
obedience include Shay’s Rebellion.
the Whiskey Insurrection, evasion of
the Fugitive Slave Law, and the
civil disorders in our labor move-
ment. These may prove that we have
had episodic disobedience of law
and even some violence in our past.
But they fall far short of any body
of genuine authority for a doctrine
which affirms the right of every man
in a representative democracy to
choose which laws he will obcy.

THE NATURAL LAW
CONCEPT

Ihe philosophical justification of
civil disobedience is even less im-
pressive to a lawyer than the mis-
cellany of precedents cited in its
behalf. In essence. it is that there is
a higher law than man-made law.
namely, the law of God or of na-
ee

But where does this philosophy
leave us in a complex modern soc-
iety governed by the rule of law? .. .
There is rarely a wide consensus,
much less unanimity, as to which
man-made laws are in fact just and
fair to all concerned. This diversity
becomes chaotic when we enter the
subjective realms of morality. God's
law and natural law

As has been observed:

lf the decision to break the law

really turns on individual con

science, it is hard to see in law

how Dr. King is any better off

than former Governor Ross

Barnett of Mississippi, who also

believed deeply in his cause and

was willing to go to jail

Whatever may be said for the
idealism of a view that permits each
man to apply his own predilection a
io a higher natural or moral law, it
affords no basis for a system of of

ganized society

and it also attracted—for the rea
sens indicated above—widespread
public and political support. It nev

ertheless resulted in a flood of ar
rests and litigation. Most of thin oc
curred prior to enactment of the
Civil Rights Aci of 1964, and

broadly speaking—two types of cases
reached om a Court: (i) sit
sated facilities. tesiing
ilk validiey | of alaie and local «

ifs ili <e

hon und anti trespass laws: and (i)

and it was—as

demonstrations, resulting in arrests
under “breach of peace” laws.

In all of these cases the Court re-
versed the convictions under state
or local laws, These results repre-
sent a striking vindication of some of
the tactics associated with disobedi-
ence, But the Court has been careful,
even in decisions which have pro-
foundly disturbed dissenting Justices,
to indicate limitations on these tac-
tics, and certainly there has been no
endorsement of civil disobedience as
a right or doctrine. . .

Two decisions of the Court, each
decided by 5 to 4 margins, merit
special attention, In Hamm v. City
of Rock Hill, the majority held that
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 abated
convictions of sit-in demonstrators
in an eating establishment covered
by the Act.

The majority opinion in Hamm
does indeed go far toward sanction-
ing certain disobedience tactics, rath-
er than resort to prescribed legal
means. This, it seems to me, is an
unnecessary and regrettable inter-
pretation of the Civil Rights Act.
But it is important to remember that
this sanction is limited to peaceful
(e.g., “non-forcible”) action in the
exercise of rights expressly conferred
by the public accommodations sec-
tion of the Act. There was no blan-

 

ket approval of sit-ins either gen-
erally or even to implement rights
under other provisions of the Act.

The second Supreme Court deci-
sion of special interest is Brown v.
Louisiana, in which convictions for
sit-ins at a public library were re
versed ...

There seems litthe doubt that the
Court would sustain the nondis
eriminatory enforcement of a
perly drawn statute regulating con
duct and prohibiting sit-ins or other
demonstrations in lbraries, In short,
the issue of racial discrimination
thence denial of equal protection)
was probably decisive Brown v.
Louisiana.

But even this rationalization leaves
Brown as an unwelcome and disturb
ing precedent. One would have hop
ed that libraries would be protected
from the disruption of all disobedi
ence tactics. including those direct
ed at racial discrimination

ESCALATION AND
PROLIFERATION

On another occasion | commented
that the frightening thing about civil
disobedience is that its use and tech-
niques tend inevitably to escalate. If
this is a justifiable concern, it is a
most serious one. Let us examine—
briefly as we must—the record.

Not Confined to “Unjust” Laws

Most of the court cases have in-
volved direct disobedience of state or
local laws deemed to be unjust...

But as the use of disobedience
tactics has expanded, the relation-
ship between the act of protest and
the law protested has become in-
creasingly attenuated. For example,
when James Farmer and _ other
CORE workers were arrested for lie-
downs at the World’s Fair in New
York, the breach of the peace law
they violated was not questioned .. .

Another example of indirect co-
ercion, involving organized violation
of admittedly valid and unjust laws,
is the school boycott used in New
York and elsewhere by Negroes to
protest failure to accelerate inte-
gration and by whites to protest bus-
ing of children from neighborhood
schools, Whether the protest was for
or against integration, the compul-
sory attendance laws were wilfully
and extensively violated to the detri-

ment of many thousands of inno-
cent children.
Not Confined to South

In its relatively short life civil dis-
obedience has become encrusted with
a number of myths. One of the more
persistent is that it is a doctrine con
fined, in its conception and applica-
tion, to conditions in the South . . .

Civil disobedience tactics undoub!
edly accelerated the pace of legisla-
tive reform. But the ultimate price of
ths acceleration may be costly in-
m terms of racial bitterness
and discord. and particularly in the
disrespect for law and order engen
dered and the lawlessness in the
streets which the doctrine of disobe
dience has encouraged. Moreover, if
our system is to survive, worthy ends
can never justify resort to unlawful
means

But one may view the
justification for its use, civil disobed
ence has not been limited either in
theory or in practice to the
South

The fact is that civil disobedience
has been preached and practiced in
all sections of the country. Many
eXamples come to mind: the sit-ins
in public and buildings. in
cluding those of the Governor of
New York. the Department of Jis
tiee and even the White House: the

Yet, just as its use has exploded
geographically across the country,
so have the “causes” proliferated,
First, the civil tights objectives have

to the limitless problems of bias,
poverty and unemployment -every-

American policy in Vietnam, peace
generally, disarmament, control of
the poverty program, and the “par-
ticipatory democracy” now advocat-
ed by elements of the New Left. . .

Civil Disorder

The concept that civil disobedi-
ence is non-violent and peaceful—
indeed even “loving”—has been per-
vasively and skillfully woven into the
speeches and literature on this sub-
ject. It is fair to say that the more
responsible leaders of the civil rights
movement also have made a genu-
ine effort—and with considerable
success—to prevent serious disorders
in most of the organized demonstra-
tions.

This has resulted in a carefully
nurtured impression that disobedi-
ence is essentially a peaceful (non-
violent) procedure, resulting in little
or no disorder and practiced without
infringement of the rights of other
citizens, Like the other myths, this
impression will not stand eritical ex-
amination.

An unauthorized sit-in on public
or private property is normally a
trespass and a violation of law. It is
also “one of the surest ways anyone
can pick out to disturb the peace.”
This is especially true where groups
physically block or occupy, by sit-
ins or lie-downs, public offices and
private property. In short, a sit-in is
not a peaceful act and it frequently
provokes actual disorder. The Su-
preme Court has sustained the vali-
dity of civil rights sit-ins under the
circumstances discussed above, but
one may be confident that in a pro-
per non-civil rights case the Court
will reaffirm traditional concepts of
trespass and breach of peace...

Moreover, even the nonviolent
demonstrations frequently exact a
high price from the public generally.
They disrupt traffic, create discor-
dant noises, litter the streets, and
deny the streets and sidewalks to
other citizens .. .

The problem—and a very diffi-
cut one indeed where multitudes
take to the streets and are told that
only just laws need be obeyed—is to
strike a balance which preserves the
liberties of all. There is mounting
evidence of imbalance and that the
use of demonstrations is getting out
of hand.

Relationship te Riots

Possibly the most serious aspect
of the expanding use of protest
methods in the name of civil disobe-
dience is the resulting incitement to
mob violence. No one knows the
extent to which the doctrine of dis-
obedience, and especially the wide-
spread resort to the streets, has con-
tributed to the general deterioration
of respect for law and order and
specifically to major outhreaks—such
as riots in Harlem. Rochester, Phil-
wleiphia. Chicago and Watts
Yet few objective observers would
deny that the contribution has been
significant

The disquieting question is wheth-
er there will be further and more
serious outbreaks . . . It is possible
for the masses—especially the eco-
nomically deprived and emotionally

inflamed—to draw fine distinctions
between “just” and “unjust” laws or
between various methods of dis

obedience? Can we reasonably ex
pect throngs in the streets to under
stand and observe subtle differences
between peaceful protest. disorderly
conduct, and mob violence?

No one has warned against the
probable answers to these questions
more eloquently than Mr. Justice
Black

Experience demonstrates that it

* nota far step from what to

many seems the carnest. honest,

patriotic. kind-spirited multitude

of today to the fanatical

threatening. lawless mob of to
morrow. And the crowds that
press in the srecis for noble

eoals today can be supplanted
tomorrow by sireet mobs pres

suring for precisely opposite

11 Disobedience’

ends....

Although there can be no doubt
that civil disobedience has contribut-
ed significantly to lawlessness in the
streets, it is a justification rather
than a fundamental cause, The cen-
tral causes of unrest in urban slums
involve complex and deep-seated
social and economic problems. These
constitute, together with the related
problems of crime, the most serious
domestic crisis of this decade, |
have spoken of this, and the urgency
of an adequate poverty and educa-
tional program, on other occasions,
But this is a paper on civil disobedi-
ence, and my conviction is that due
process and democratic procedures,
even though painfully slow at times,
are a far more dependable and cer-
tainly less dangerous means of cor-
recting injustice and solving social
problems.

THE FUTURE: WHERE
DOES CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
GO FROM HERE?

So much for a review—obviously
an incomplete one—of the origin,
characteristics and proliferation of
contemporary civil disobedience. It
is perhaps now appropriate to ask
where America may be headed—if
we continue on the widening path of
disobedience . . .

We are blessed in America by a
system of government which pro-
vides expressly for the accomplish-
ment of change by orderly processes.
The Constitution, both by amend-
ment and interpretation, has proved
to be a remarkably flexible and re-
silient charter of government and of
personal liberty. The street mob and
massive civil disobedience, so fami-
liar in countries not governed by the
rule of law, have had no place in our
country.

The question now being seriously
asked is whether we are making a
place for these techniques of coer-
cion and lawlessness. The record of
the past decade is sobering to anyone
concerned with due process. We
started with massive disobedience of
Supreme Court decisions by segrega-
tionists. The concept of disobedience
was then adopted and enlarged, far
more skillfully and effectively, by
integrationists in the civil rights
movement. More recently we have
witnessed an ever-growing diffusion
and expansion of the use of civil dis-
obedience, of the causes in which it
is employed, and in the character of
oe

Those drawn to civil disobedience
by the worthiness of causes might
reflect that the doctrine is urged as
one of universal application, with
its moral imperatives and techniques
available to all. If sit-ins and mas-
sive demonstrations are justified for
the “worthy” they are equally justifi-
ed for the “unworthy.” as under this
doctrine each man may determine
which laws are unjust, and each has
the “moral duty” to disobey them.
The fortunate fact that the Ku Klux
Klan has not yet engaged in massive
disobedience against civil rights leg-
islation suggests no unique respect
for law by Klansmen but rather a
lack of numerical strength and o:
ganization, elements which it could
acquire...

The logical and inescapable end of
civil disobedience is the destruction
of public order. and in the anarchy
which follows. all liberty would be
lost,

Although many voices still call. ir
responsibly [| think. for “enlarge-
ment of the role of civil disobedi
ence,” We may assume that most of
these would draw the line at some
point——if they could. But there may
be real doubt whether the forces
and passions already set in motion
can be reversed short of grave dam
age to basic values of a free «x
—_...

Moreover, the very rights and
ratses now sought to be vindicated
through these tactics can. in the end
be assured only so long as laws are
observed and due process followed
It has been wisely said that “min
orily groups are the ones who
always suffer the mosi when <ircet
multitudes are allowed to substitute
their pressures for the les« glamor
ous but more dependable and tem
perate processes of the law

The ultimate danger is to the rul
of law and the framework of govern
ment which sistains if Hit
has demorsirated thai once A un
ety condones organized defiance of
law and due process, it becomes in
creasingly difficull to protect its in
stitutions and to safeguard liberty

Generals’ Defense Shines
As Sewanee Falls, 21-14

For the first time in two years the
Generals put together a two game
varsity football win streak with a
21-14 decision over Sewanee last
Saturday. It was the second week in
a row that the Generals’ ground
game sparkled, while the passing at-
tack left quite a bit to be desired.

Once again, the defense played a
beautiful game, limiting the Tigers
to a meager 42 yards rushing and
forcing them to go to the air. That
effort also proved futile as Sewanee
Quarterback Walters completed only
8 of 34 attempts and threw two in-
terceptions.

WAL carried on its trend of being
a first half team, as they tallied all
21 points in the first two periods. In
fact, the Generals have been able to
produce a total of only seven second
half points through six games this
season.

The Blue got the first break of the
game late in the first period when

the Sewanee punter was forced to
run after getting a bad center snap.
Jon Markley caught him on the
Tiger 23, dropping him for a 22
yard loss, Fluharty then guided the
Generals in with the aid of his able
runners,

JoJo Martin put W&L ahead with
a burst off tackle for three yards
and the score. Doug Chase added
the PAT and with 2:27 left in the
first quarter the Generals were ahead
by a 7-0 margin.

Sewanee returned the kickoff to its
own 33, but that proved to be the
Tigers’ deepest advance. On the sec-
ond play from scrimmage, Sims
fumbled and Al McWhorter fell on
it for the Blue at the Sewanee 35.

Once again, through the combin-
ed efforts of Martin, Lat Purser, and
Jim Farrar, the Generals struck pay-
dirt with the final thrust coming on
a seven yard run up the middle by
Farrar. The point after was good,

giving W&L a 14-0 lead.

The third General score came in
the same period following another
Tiger error. A fumble gave them the
ball on the Sewanee 18, but two five
yard penalties pushed W&L back to
the 28. On third down and twenty,
Fluharty found Chappy Conrad
open in the end zone and hit him
with a scoring pass. With the extra
point, the Generals took a 21-0
lead with less than two minutes left
in the half,

Sewanee took the ball at their own
42 following the kickoff and drove
58 yards in nine plays. The extra
point was good, and at half time the
score stood at 21-7 in favor of the
Generals.

The second half turned into a de-
fensive battle as the Generals’ of-
fense stalled and gained but two first
downs in the final two periods. How-
ever, the Blue defense held the Tig-
ers to only one touchdown, that on
a 74 yard pass play, and W&L had
its second victory of the season.

Chappy Conrad continued his
good play with four receptions and
a 46.9 punting average.

The Generals will meet Southwes-
tern in a CAC game next Saturday
at Wilson Field in what promises to
be an excellent Parents’ Weekend

Generals Finish
Second Overall,
In Water Polo

BY CLIFF OVERCASH

Washington and Lee’s first water
polo team made a big splash at the
state tournament, held in Charlottes-
ville last Friday and Saturday. The
Generals finished second in a strong
field that included UVa., Lynchburg
College, Old Dominion, VMI, Rich-
mond, and William and Mary. The
Generals were undefeated in their
division, out-battling Lynchburg Col-
lege 16-10, Old Dominion 18-5, and
Virginia
Generals lost to a very strong UVa.

“A” team 12-9, Excellent defensive |
work kept UVa.’s high scoring of- }
fense below its average. The Wahoos {
had scored at least 22 goals in each |

previous game. The defensive success
was due largely to W&L’s goalie,
Senior Bim Clark, who was a un-
animous selection as All-State. An-
other All-State performer was fresh-
man captain Dick Barber, who scor-
ed 29 goals in the tournament, the
highest total of anyone there.

Even though it is was the first
state water polo meet, the response
was so good that it is certain to be-
come an annual event. Washington

LaRue’s

BY BOB “LASH” LARUE

“The University has announced
plans to build a $2.2 million addi-
tion to Doremus Gymnasium and to
construct a separate $500,000 field
house in the vicinity of Wilson Field
and its surrounding outdoor fields.”
April, 1969 issue of the
Washington and Lee Alumnus

Is the construction of a $500,000
field house in Washington and Lee’s
future? For that matter, is any field
house? As much as the Athletic De-
partment and a lot of students and
even some faculty would like to see
one built, the prospects for the
much-needed building are dim, What
started out as a promise in the spring
of 1969 has drifted into obscurity in
the fall of 1971.

It has been stated many times pre-
viously in this column that a multi-
purpose facility is virtually a neces-
sity. The structure would serve as a
headquarters for participants in eight
intercollegiate sports: football, base-
ball, lacrosse, track, soccer, cross-
country, golf and tennis, The field
house would provide indoor space
for instruction in these sports and
house locker and dressing facilities
for physical education classes and
athletic teams participating in out-
door programs.

Presently, the facilities beneath the
stadium are, in a word, detestable
Two shower areas force athletic par-
ticipants to wash in shifts; usually,
half of the sprinklers do not work or
emit a poor trickle. Drains clog
daily in the drafty premises; ath-
letes’ foot ranks behind pneumonia
as the most common ailment con-
nected with the facilities. Team gear
is crammed into spare corners as
adequate space is scarce. Who can
blame the freshmen (or anyone) who
gets turned off W&L athletics by
miserable facilities?

Why, then has the University been
dragging its feet on the field house
issue? According to Mr. Frank A.
Parsons, assistant to the President,
money is the biggest drawback. Most

the fact that winter weather is not so
inclement as to impede practice.
When asked about the possibilities of
renovating the stadium facilities,
Parson replied that the University
was hesitant to proceed until it had
decided on the field house’s future.

Thus, at present, the plans for a
new field house, or at least for re
modeling the stadium area, are in
limbo,

Money seems to be the question
(which | do feel it should be), what
are the possibilities of student amor-
tization or a bond issue? Granted,
with student amortization, the stand-
ard shell-type field house may have
to be discredited tor the less expen-
sive bubble variety, like the one in
use of Harvard, which go for around
$150,000. But, such an edifice could
be quickly paid off by charging
each student and faculty member
five dollars a year. Student amortiza-
tion of this type has worked success-

Law School Awaits Coeds

By PAUL LANCASTER

The Washington and Lee Law
School will accept applications from
women for the first time next year.
The decision to do so came on
the recommendation of the faculty
of the School to the Board of
Trustees,

“We had been discussing it (going
coeducational) since | came down
here as Dean of the School (in
1968),” Dean Steinheimer revealed.

Roy L. Steinheimer, Dean of the

Law School, forésees no increase in
the school when it becomes a co
educational institution next fall.
“The enrollment will remain the
same,” the head of the Law School
said, “mainly because of the school’s
physical limitations.”

The decision was somewhat hast-

ened by a recent ruling of the
American Association of Law
Schools. The AALS has recently

decided to accredit only those law
schools whose admission policies are

Student Committee
Accepts $20,000 Gift

In their meeting Monday night the
Executive Committee announced a
substantial foundation grant for the
Student Recruiting Committee and
also selected the first female student
to sit on that body. The EC also
heard progress reports from the
Planning and Development Commit
tee and the W&L Pre-Law Society.

Student Body President Steve
Robinson revealed that the Hillsdale
Foundation of Greensboro, North
Carolina, has delivered a $20.000
contribution for the recruitment of
underprivileged students. The Stu-
dent Recruiting Committee received
its first grant last year of $5,000,
which has already been significantly
bettered this year.

The EC also voted to select
Debby Veale, an exchange student
from Wilmington, Delaware. to sit
on the Student Recruitment body.

In further business, Mike McCall
discussed the progress made by his
Planning and Development Commit-
tee and to determine the working
status of his group. McCall said that
thus far the committee has served
in the following capacities: (1) to
help prepare present students to ac

cept the responsibilities of alumni
following graduation, (2) to improve
“town and gown” relations in Lex

ington, (3) to work with the Uni
versity's Development Office in
alumni relations, (4) to have an

active role in advising future physi-
cal improvements on campus.

McCall complained that his com
mittee did not have the sufficient
direction and back-up from the stu
dent government to perform effectiv-
ely in these areas. “When we try to
work with the alumni office or the
development office, they're not sure
who we are and what we're sup
posed to do,” he said,

Bob Brennan, a junior who also
serves on the Planning Committee,
agreed, saying “we are beating our

heads against the wall” in trying
to determine the purpose and the
status of their committee.

Rick Gray suggested that the

Planning and Development group be
made a “full-fledged” Standing Com
mittee of the EC. McCall added that
his committee has produced a maga
zine to send to alumni, but that it
has received no support fer publica

Restores Hundred-Y ear-Old Church

Jim Swann Refurbishes

By “MOON” ELLISON

The University catalogue stoutly
maintains a “common living experi
ence has been found to be valuable
during the first year of college.” If
surviving in the dorms is valuable
then living in one of Jim Swann’s
churches should rate as high with
the faculty as Saturday classes and
Lee's birthday.

Swann, a senior from Clearwater
Florida, is in the process of com
pletely renovating
his second church. The independent
major, originally. dissatisfied with
upperclassmen living facilities in and

around Lexington, and with a keen
eye for a long-run financial gain

not discriminatory in regards to the
applicant’s sex. Dean Steinheimer
pointed out that it would be wrong
to say that the decision “didn't
have something to do with the tim-
ing of the decision.”

The number of applications from
women is in question. “I don’t have
any idea how many applications
we'll have,” the Dean stated. “We've
been contacting girls’ schools in Vir-
ginia and elsewhere.” At the present
time, there are 252 males attending
the Law School,

The move to go coeducational was
made independently of the question
of the undergraduate school of W&I
admitting women. At the present
time, the undergraduate school
would suffer significant economic
problems if it were to go coed,
according to the President of the
University, Robert Huntley.

The Law School was founded in
1849, and it currently consists of a
faculty of 12 professors and two
visiting lecturers. Five of its alumni
have been elected president of the
American Bar Association, includ-
ing Ross Malone, vice-president of
General Motors Corp., and Lewis F.
Powell, nominee to the Supreme
Court.

Dr. Charles Light, a member of
the Law School's faculty, antici-
pates no problems in the classroom
next year. “I've taught in coeduca-
tional institutions before, and it cer-
tainly didn’t seem strange. I don't
see any great problems at all next

year,” Dr. Light remarked.
Commenting on the relation of
the decision of the AALS to the

institution’s decision to go coeduca-
tional, Dr. Light noted, “That cir-
cumstance (the AALS decision) is
obviously relevant to the problem.”
Dr. Light explained the importance
of being accredited by the AALS,
as it and the American Bar Associa
tion are the only two major ac-
crediting bodies in the United States

ing. The building is presently for
sale or rent and Swann is quick to
point out that he wants only a 20%
return on his” investment. His
motives are as uncommercial as the
structures he works with, and doesn't
seem the least perturbed about mak
quick sale. His reward, it
has already been collected

The decision to go coeducational
was announced two weeks ago by
President Huntley, In contrasting the
situation in the Law School to that
of the undergraduate school, Presi-
dent Huntley cited more problems
involved with the latter in  trans-
forming it into a coed school, He
noted that the undergraduate divis-
ion would have to be increased in
its enrollment by at least 30 per-
cent, for both social and academic
reasons.

However, the undergraduate ques-
tion still remains and is being closely
scrutinized for a comparison of pros
and cons of the situation, The Board
of Trustees has received a detailed
faculty report on the implications of
coeducation, and it has followed
the experiences of colleges similar
to Washington and Lee which have
recently gone coeducational.

The Law School's decision. then
will present a new facet of life at
WAL. For the first time, women will
be a full-time asset of the uni-
versity.

Supposedly, the University Council is a forum of univer-

sity opinion. It is not.
The council has become a large body characterized by ab-
senteeism, lack of discussion, shortage of planning, loss of

direction and benign acceptance of university policy.
\bsenteeism has been evident for the last four meetings
of the body. The situation was criticized in an editorial last

spring in this paper. That editorial cited some students for

shirking responsibility. This phenomenon has shown to be
contagious because administrators and faculty members have
begun to stay away. The discussion in the group has declined

Rush Views Disputed

fo the Editor:

I wish to take issue with several
misconceptions in the editorial on
Rush in the Ring-tum Phi of Octo-
ber 27. First, to say the “preferential
card system was run quite lackadaisi-
cally” does not make sense and
quite unfair, On Monday afternoon
| personally manned a preference
card box in the Freshman Quad
from 4:00 to 5:15 in the afternoon.
At 5:20 | moved that box to the
foyer of Evans Dining Hall and
maintained it until 6:15. That box
was not unmanned at any time. On
Tuesday, October 13, at 9:00 in the
morning. the preference box was
again placed in the Quad. It re-
mained there all day, being manned
by three IFC officials at various
times during the day. It was not
manned at all times for the entire
day, but, just as on Monday, the
box was moved to Evans Dining
Hall for the dinner hour. On Wed
nesday, information was placed in
this paper explaining how to hand in
the bid cards even though the box
was no longer in operation.

ton and Lee, Lupton said, “The
Executive Committee is quite effec-
tive; it is a vital and functioning

part of student government.” Duke
Stevens stated that while it has

weak spots, “It is good. I am not
trying to knock it just help it.”

Each of the new representatives
stated that he had specific objectives
in mind for the coming year, Keat-
ley stated that his major objective
will be to represent the views of
the Freshman Class and be re-
sponsive to the majority will. The
importance of remaining in com-
munication with the class members
was voiced by Lupton. He said, “I
want to stay in touch and hear the
minor issues as well as major issues
concerning campus life.”

When asked if they believed that

on Monday, Tuesday, and the notifi-
cation in the paper, the IFC was
able to inform fraternities on Tues-
day evening, October 19, of the re-
sults of Rush (not “October 25”).
Furthermore, since that time there
have been relatively few changes in
the tabulation of fraternity member-
ship.

What may be concluded from the
results of the preferential cards?
First. some 65 people refused to
even respond to the requests of
handing in preferential cards. These
people probably either dropped out
of Rush early or have decided not to
join a fraternity. Second, frater-
nity membership is down from last
year.

The second comment in the article
that lacks clarity is the tagging of
the long S-week Rush as a “concrete
indictment against the fraternities.”
The S-week Rush plan is only the
result of a recommendation of the
Student Affairs Committee approved
by the University Council last spring.
The IFC had to follow these recom-
mended guidelines. There was no
choice. If there was, the fraternities
themselves would probably have
structured a shorter Rush.

greater than originally existed.

The UN is strikingly similar to
the League of Nations: both bodies
were powerless, both bodies lacked
leadership. and both bodies were
held in esteem only as long as the
great powers allowed them a sham
of reputability. The League collaps-
ed when it failed to prevent the
Second World War. How effective
ean any rational person. judging
from its past history and the meager
promise it provides, feel the UN
would be in preventing another
world conflagration?

The expulsion of Nationalist China
brings up an even more frightening
point: where will the UN go. now
that it has decided to pick and
choose only those nations it regards
as ideologically suitable? How long
will it be before the UN begins cast-
ing out any other nation that refuses
to agree to its lunatic plans?
though we are not in danger of ex
pulsion, since we provide one-third
of the UN's budget, still it may not
be too many years until we are the
lone non-communist nation left in
this august body

The late Robert Alphonso
once said of the UN. “Lets go it
alone.” His wise words were ignored
at the time, but it is not too late for
us to quit the United Nations. It is a
silly thing to spend money on. it is
a worthless thing to listen to. and
most importantly, if is a dangerous
body to belong to. All the aggrava

would have liked more participation.
Stevens said, “I don’t feel that they

are reverting back to the ‘high

City Plates Required

lo the Editor:

Questions have recently arisen
concerning the requirement for stu-
dents to purchase city license plates
for their automobiles, particularly in
their senior year. | believe clarifica-
tion of the policy concerning this
matter may be helpful.

City Council considered the situa-
tion of a senior student being re-
quired to purchase a license by April
15 and leaving the community a few
weeks later. Their deliberations in-
cluded similar circumstances of
other citizens who for some reason
moved from the city, and were
therefore in a position of holding a
license for an unused period of time.
Refunds for an unused portion of a
license fee is regulated by State law
which provides for such refunds only
in event of disposal of the vehicle
without replacement. City Council
ruled that senior students, like other
citizens, would be required to pur-
chase license plates.

In an effort io compensate some-
what for the rigidity of the laws
concerning refunds, the Council
adopted a policy of requiring the
purchase of license plates by stu-
dents to become effective after Oc-
tober | at the beginning of any
school year. This is the date on
which these licenses are reduced to
one half of their annual cost, and, of
course, is beneficial to students only
upon making an initial purchase of
city license plates.

The only exemption which stu-
dents who reside within the city have
from purchasing City of Lexington
licenses is that they have displayed
on their vehicle a valid city or coun-
ty license from a Virginia political
subdivision.

Unforgivable Travesties

To the Editor

We had a meeting last week of
the Unforgivable Travesty Commit
tee and we have decided that it
sefves our interests to the utmost
to join in the hue and ery for in
creased athletic facilities. We feel
that not only should a field house
be built so that we can enjoy indoor
lacrosse games but a building should
be constructed also (perhaps on the
current site of duPont Hall) so that
wonderful sport so popular south of
the border can be brought to Wash
ingion and Lee

the members of our committee
feel that jaialai should not be
neglected if we are to claim a truly
full athletic program: also ecck-fight

contract food service optional for
freshmen, and providing hot water
in the dormitories at all times are
some more down-to-earth issues that
need to be attacked. Lupton said,
“The conditions in the dormitories
will be my responsibility to convey
to the Executive Committee.” Keat-
ley suggested that the E.C. News-
letter be used to inform the students
on upcoming topics at its meetings.

Stevens suggested that the univer-

Changes Cause Despair

fo the Editor:

Washington and Lee is changing.
at a rate greater than ever before.
This is not surprising, for WAL is
not an isolated community, but a
microcosm of or society. Change in

itself is not bad, but most of the
changes here make me unhappy.
even despair. In particular, I see

WEL losing smallness, warmth and
ideals. Most of my complaints deal
with the “physical plant.”

The terrace in front of the old
freshmen dorm seems particularly
useless and ugly. A lot of concrete
was poured and brick laid. There
are & foot-wide sidewalks and curbs
everywhere. Why? How often will
50 people gather there? The quad
does quite well. Landscaping, like
there was before, would have done
alright.

Consider the addition to the Red
Square parking lot. at the entrance
to the school. Lawn was torn up,
and replaced by crushed stone and
concrete curbs. For $35,000 we now
have a sometimes muddy, rutty place
for our metal conveyances, where
once there was grass and where
boys played football, And it is in-
adequate. For all the parking lot
additions and improvements, there is
not enough space. | know of one
faculty member who had to park
at Wilson field or beyond because of
no closer space. WAL is truly a re
flection of the larger society. It gets
more chewed-up and uglier, and still
the problems increase. This problem
could be eliminated in a simple
fashion: everyone within a mile of
two could walk, or ride a bicycle
But people would have to change
their ways or maybe sacrifice. As ii
is now. only three or four of the
faculty, and a handful of students
ride bikes

The addition to the gym is almost
completed almost $3 mil

space, and tigliness. We needed more

Group Plans Varied Concert Series

“Without music, life would be a
mistake.” These words appropriately
sum up the sentiments of the spon-
sors of The Rockbridge Concert-
Theater Series.

Since the early 40's, the Rock-
bridge Concert-Theatre Series (not
to be confused with the Concert
Guild of W&L), has provided Rock-
bridge County with top names in
the area of fine music and drama.
With our own Dean William Watt
as its head, the series will this sea-
son sponsor four attractions, includ-
ing “The World’s Greatest Jazz
Band,” Lilian Kallir—pianist, The
Munich Chamber Orchestra and The
Turnau Opera Players.

The concert-theatre series is a
non-profit association which relies
entirely upon the financial and physi-
cal contributions of its patrons, of
whom more than half are students
at Washington and Lee and V.M.1.
The people who actually make the
program work (a board of 50 di-
rectors), are described by Dean Watt
as, “A very heterogeneous group
which arranges for performances
which they hope will be appealing to
both college students and local resi-
dents.

By LEX McMILLAN

One afternoon last month a W&L
student was walking out of his apart-
ment when he was approached by
one of Lexington’s law enforcement
officers. Establishing the identifica-
tion of the student, the officer in-
formed him that he was under
arrest, He was informed of his
rights, taken “downtown” and book-
ed. Fingerprints, picture (front and
profile) the whole thing. The charge
was conspiracy to fraud. This is a

pretty serious charge and needless
to say our fellow student was some-
what upset.

The reason for the charge was a
bad check which the student had
written to the Red Front Grocery.
Rather than following the well-
known procedures set up by the
Student Financial Relations Com-
mittee, the people at the Red Front
called the cops.

Now there might be some mitigat-
ing circumstances which justify this

Coffee House Sponsors Events

By MIKE HAMMOND

The Dutch Inn Coffee House, sup-
ported primarily by donations, is still
in operation, Since opening in Octo-
ber at least four programs have been
held on Saturday nights ranging
from folk singing to breadmaking.
According to board member Chris
Bowring the crowds have been large
and the upcoming events are equally
varied, It would seem that the Coffee
House has found a substantial foot-
hold in the Lexington community
and the W&L student body.

The Dutch Inn Coffee House was
begun a year ago last fall by a
group of Lexington townsmen and
WAL students. The group was form-
ed to give students and the com-
munity residents a place to go
Saturday nights to enjoy an eve
ning’s entertainment. The original
organizers also conceived the Coffee
House as a place to hold organiza-
tional meetings of clubs and in
lerest groups. It was available for
those who were interested in creative
writing, dancing, poetry, and relig
ion, Even more groups have applied
to use the facilities this year. The
Coffee House was organized with a
dedication to community involve

ment with as few economic hind-
rances to that involvement as pos-
sible.

By January of last year a separ-
ate project was being organized and
built within the Coffee House, The
idea was to launch a lunch pro-
gram. Necessary items for the res-
taurant business were obtained and
installed. By February the health
department had granted a license
and the restaurant opened under the
management of Christopher Bowring
and Ricky Blair. The lunch pro-
gram will open this year under
the auspices of prospective manager
Crosby Turner,

Meanwhile the Coffee House con-
tinues to provide Saturday night
entertainment consisting of student
films, guitar playing, folk singing,
poetry recitals, and appearances by
various and sundry guest speakers,
On Saturday nights the doors open
around eight o'clock, The crowds
filter into a receptive aroma of
coffee which is in plentiful supply
Other activities range from chess to
three dimensional tick-tack-toe. Rec
ords are played, and someone is very
likely to start playing a guitar. Dis
cussion groups are prominent and
any topic is likely to be discussed

The board of directors of the

are instrumental in the continued
functioning of the Coffee House.
Meetings are held on Mondays at
3:30 p.m. where innovative ideas are
discussed.

The board has deep gratitude for

Delts dominated the game on
offense. They had several scoring
opportunities, but Law interceptions
kept them from scoring.

The Delts received the opening
kickoff, but failed to move. A block-

first chance to score, but Bob Brum-

The first quarter ended with no
score, but the Delts moved the ball,
mostly on passes to Ted Bauer.

As the second quarter got under
way, the Delts continued to move,
until an interception stopped the
drive. Each team intercepted again,
and the Law School generated its
first offensive drive, mostly on short
passes to interior linemen. But the
drive stalled, and Bauer returned the
punt for good yardage. The Delt

with nostalgia upon hearing that the

Somehow the Blue could not put
together the defense that held off
U.Va. two weeks ago, and the

speedy North Carolina ruggers went
in for a score six times,

The Blue were not prepared for
the razzle-dazzle Carolina strategy
and play. Those plays combined
with the greater UNC size and speed
gave the Tarheels the winning edge.

But all was not lost. Washington
and Lee Rugby reproved itself to
be as great a spectator sport as any
other, as the UNC ruggers kept the
audience entertained with an in-
credible banter, self-commendation,
and a wild string of epithets, to say
nothing of playing in an irregular
fashion,

Next week the Blue face up to
the powerful Norfolk Rugby Club.

Footlong up on Main Street was
being torn down. This gourmet

establishment was our headquarters
four years ago when we were stang-
ers to old “Lexburg,” looking for

a place we could call our own
Being the first ones in town, we
soon coaxed other freshmen upon

their arrival to partake of some of
the Footlong’s culinary delicacies.
The place featured its own singular
version of hamburgers, hotdogs, and
french fries.

But this depot was famous coun-
try-wide not for its exemplary food
but for two beverages. First of all,
it was about the only place in town
where anybody could buy Dr. Pepper
over-the-counter with food, Now,
not everybody appreciates this car-
bonated “prune juice,” | know, but
to eat a snack without a Dr. Pepper
was to some Southern boys criminal.
However, if one’s mind was not set
on this kind of refreshment (or on
another variety of liquid nutrition,
which we, as football players, were
unable to sample), then we would
purchase the Footlong’s Speciality of
the House-——a thick, creamy milk-
shake in either chocolate, vanilla, or
strawberry. For only a quarter—a
mere twenty-five pennies—we could
enjoy one of the finest treats this
side of Interstate 81.

Southwestern Wins 35-25;
Generals’ Offense Dies

By LEWIS HIXSON

With the stands at Wilson Field
creaking from the largest crowd of
the season, the W&L Generals
dropped a 35-25 decision to South-
western in an important CAC Con-
ference game. It was Parents’ Week-
end and both teams put forth good
efforts in making this one of the
most exciting home games in re-
cent years,

The game contained many high-
lights with each team contributing
several sparkling plays. Dave Brooks
was outstanding on punt returns as
he had two long returns of 79 and
64 yards, the first going for a touch-
down. Chappy Conrad did a good
job of punting as he averaged 46.5
yards a boot. His longest kick of the
day travelled 69 yards. Conrad also
hauled in three passes, one of them
going for a score. Tim Haley also
played a fine game on defense.

The Generals’ problems involved
a combination of things. Steve Flu-
harty was intercepted three times,
two of which proved very costly, as
they set up a pair of Southwestern
scores. The defensive secondary was
beaten several times long, one South-
western pass going tor a 50 yard
touchdown. Another problem was in
containing Southwestern’s quarter-
back; he rushed for 109 yards,

The Generals scored first on a 37
yard field goal by Doug Chase at
the end of the first quarter giving
the Blue a 3-0 lead. However, the

lead was short-lived as Southwestern
came back with a score on a 16
yard run by Warren early in the
quarter. That made the score 7-3
in favor of Southwestern, and it was
only the beginning of a 52 point
quarter. The Blue fought back for
another score following a fumble
by Southwestern on their own 26,
The scoring play came on an eight
yard pass from Fluharty into the
corner of the end zone where
Conrad was waiting. Chase’s extra
point was good and with 9:47 re-
maining in the quarter the Generals
led 10-7,

Southwestern was unable to move
following the kickoff and was forced
to punt. The punt came to Dave
Brooks on his own 21, he broke to
his right and found running room
down the sidelines. He went all the
way for a 70 yard punt return
and 6 points. The extra point made
the score 17-7 and ended the Gen-
erals’ scoring for the quarter. There
were still 21 points to be scored
before half-time and they all went
to Southwestern, The first of the

three touchdowns came on an 80
yard pass play and the next two
were running plays of three and

eight yards,

After a thrilling halftime show by
the Southwestern band, things got
under way again. Late in the third
quarter Southwestern was again
forced to punt and Brooks again
made an excellent return.

This time

he went for 64 yards before being
caught on the Southwestern 18. The
Blue moved all 18 yards on the
ground, scoring on the fifth play of
the drive on a three yard plunge
off tackle by Fluharty. That moved
the Generals within three points,
28 to 25,

Southwestern came right back
after taking the ball on their own
38 following the kickoff. They
moved the length of the field in
11 plays with Morris finally going
in from the five. That put the score
at 35-25 and that’s the way it
stayed,

Next week the Generals take on
the Coast Guard Academy here in
what will prove to be a tough con-
test. The Coast Guard will be
another big team that the Blue will
have to match up to. This will be
the last home game of the season
and one of the final two chances the
Generals have to improve on last
year’s record, The final game of the
season will be in St. Louis against
Washington on November 20.

Freshman Parietals Abolished;
Head Counselor Gives Opinion

By J. HUDSON ALLENDER

Traditions and rules have fallen
as of late around W&L like the
leaves which now cover the campus.
The last such leaf to contribute to
the pile has been weekend parietals
in the Freshmen dorms. The Student
Affairs Committee last week voted
six to four with one abstention to
remove the overnight restriction for
female visitation during the week-
ends.

Those of us who will graduate in
June easily recall a Freshman year
of no girls or alcohol allowed what-
soever in the dorms. Since then all
has transpired in a flurry and the
notion of drunken orgies in Dorm
I is now, at least, a possibility if
not a probability. The astonishing
chain of events leading up to this

crowning step by SAC began in
the Fall of 1969 when alcoholic

beverages were seen for the first
time (legally, that is) in the dorms,
The following fall brought parietal
hours to provide for female visita-
tion, the restrictions of which were
considerably liberalized during the
following year and brought the trend

equally generous, and it seemed to

bench in Arizona and (you guessed
it) a past President of the ABA, rose

to speak for his friend, William
Rehnquist. Before he even got

around to his considerably more
desperate colleague, Craig bestowed
considerable praise on the Virginian,
saying he was one of the most
qualified lawyers in the nation.

During Rehnquist's interrogation,
all the aspirations and jealousies that
motivated the senators became ap
parent, under a guise of parliament-
ary courtesy.

On one side of the semi-circular
commitee table sat the stars of the
opposition: freshman John Tunney:
quiet, bearded Philip Hart: Ted
Kennedy (the murmurs that broke
out when he entered the room seem-
ed to suggest that Kennedy glow has
rendered the shadow of ,Chappa-
quidick dim, dimmer); and the leader

to the current school year.

Following the interim adjustment
period, each dorm section was al-
lowed to set up its own rules and
regulations including its own hours
for female visitation. However, there
were certain limits imposed on the
hours by the University. There were
to be no overnight guests in the
dorms nor were women to be pres-
ent between midnight and 2:00 the
following afternoon during the
week. The spirit of the University
restriction was resented and ques-
tioned by many.

A little over two weeks ago the
dorm counselors drafted a statement
to present to SAC with respect to
their views of parietals. In effect
they suggested that the overnight
restriction was hazy and _ therefore
hardly enforceable; freshmen are
more mature than they had been
given credit for and could success-
fully govern their own sections; there
is the injustice of requiring fresh-

men to live in dorms and to live
under university determined rules
without freedom of choice. After

hearing the counselors’ presentation
and discussing its ramifications fot

On the other side, the line-up
included the persistent Hiram Fong.
a surprisingly reserved Strom Thur-
mond, Charles MacMathias of
Maryland, and the prime defender
of the administration’s nominees and
one of the last men in the Senate,
since Everett Dirksen’s passing, to
display a real oratorical flair, Sena-
tor Roman Hruska of Nebraska.

In the center sat the chairman
Fastand, cigar clenched in his teeth,
unsmiling, resentful of Bayh’s whin-

never the least bit subtle about

complaints and protests of the cor-

Joseph Rauh, and the NAACP
representative Clarence Mitchell

were relegated to unimportance by
the symbolic absence of one man.
Phe questioning of Rehnquist was
politely hostile. Bayh pounded away

extract his opinions on the crucial
issues of the nomination—the wire

quite a while, SAC tabled a motion
regarding parietals until they could
hear from the newly-elected Fresh-
man officers,

Freshman officers did answer
questions at SAC last Thursday and
the motion was brought off the
table. For various reasons the over-
night restriction was lifted giving
open dorms between noon Friday
and midnight Sunday for weekends.
SAC chose to keep the 2 to mid-
night limits on weekday visitation,
however, with a watchful eye on
possible study problems. This monu-
mentous bit of legislation had been
foreshadowed a week earlier when
all parietal restrictions had been
lifted for upperclass dorms.

It is now up to each section indi-
vidually to determine what hours it
wants for visitation. They can now,
however, experience overnight guests
without fear of reprimand. This is
viewed as a victory of principle —
these men can have further say over
how their lives are to be run.

So long little leaf of administrative
babysitting. What next will this
breeze of change blow off to add
to the fast-growing pile?

Then the battle ensued between
Bayh and Hruska, who claimed that
another past nominee, Thurgood
Marshall, had declined to answer
questions on matters that might ap-
pear before the court at a later
time and that no one had questioned
that then.

“After accepting a series of nomi-
nations over the years, all of a
liberal bent, | see no reason why
we should not take every advantage
of this happy prospect of two con-
servative nominees,” Hruska said,
caressing his vowels so as to get
everything he could out of each
and every word.

In the end Rehnquist did more or
less answer all of Bayh’s questions—
but not to Bayh. The fact that
Rehnquist delayed his answers until
the Republican Mathias had his turn
at questioning revealed the firmly
rehearsed political interplay that
underlies a hearing of this sort,

Many seem to foster the illusion
that a Supreme Court justice is
somehow above politics — and per-
haps as a presiding servant he is.
But beneath that outward dignity
of these hearings, there have been
obviously some intricate partisan
machinations going on — so that
when it comes time for the nominee
to open up, it is before one of the
President's men, and not before the
zealous Presidential aspirant from
Indiana.

Another fascinating story behind
these nominations is that of the act-
ual choice itself, which seems to have
arisen im numerous versions in the
dispatches of the press. Immediately
after the President's announcement
a few week's ago, the wire services.
the Post, the Times, and every major
source declared that the decision to
go with Powell and Rehnquist came
at the last minute, after the ABA
had mixed the rumored favorites,
William Friday and Mildred Lilley

But it eventually came to light,
as Mr. Powell told the Ring-tum
Phi in an interview two weeks ago,
that the decision had been made at
least 48 hours before the President's
announcement, casting an
entirely different light on the White
House decision-making.

choice of two such laudable

for a time at least.

The final question that eventually
arises is that, if the media account
can be so inaccurate in this one
case with which we at W&L are
specifically familiar, one must ask:
how often does a crucial error by
the press delude us into the wrong
conclusion about events of which
we do not happen to be locally
knowledgeable?

Steve Robinson urged that the
Planning and Development Commit-
tee’s primary area of concern should
be to improve alumni relations. Mc-
Call said that many alumni were
surprised at changes on the W&L
campus, due to the fact that they
had not been educated as to these
occurrences through university pub-
lications.,

It was pointed out that the Uni-
versity Bulletin present a strained
effort to preserve the illusion of
conventional dress on campus. To
correct some of these misapprehen-
sions, said Lock Hanley, “it seems
to me we'd be in direct conflict
with what the administration is try
ing to do.” He agreed, nevertheless,
that this type of alumni education
must be ensued.

The newly-formed Pre-Law So
ciety outlined their purpose. and

count was closed. There seems to be
some pretty sloppy business activity
involved here but that is not the
main point of this column.

The point is that the people of
Lexington are rapidly losing any
trust or confidence they ever had in
W&L students. Students have in-
creasingly abused their privileged
position of credit which they have
traditionally had in Lexington. Last
year the number of cold checks
handled by the Student Financial
Relations Committee was phenome-
nally greater than in past years,

Another student was also arrested
for fraud last month for a bad check

of this case as well as the other
but what is clear is that if you go
around carelessly writing bad checks
and expecting the Committee to keep
your records you may find your-
self spending the night (or even
longer) in jail. Hopefully, the people
of Lexington can be reassured. It
will take real effort on the part
of the students to rebuild the confid-
ence that once was there, Perhaps
most students don’t really care
enough to make this effort. Well if

Folk Singer Will
enings Weekend

1 W&L Op

Openings weekend kicks off this
Friday night with a University
combo party in the Cockpit, but
the highlight of the weekend will
be Gordon Lightfoot’s Saturday

night Doremus concert. Then, there
will always be those who won't

make it past the Saturday afternoon
grain party at the Pavillion.

After a series of highly successful
combos in the Cockpit featuring
varied types of music, the Student
Center has turned this week to the
Dill Brothers, an inventive blues
band, to put the weekend off to a
good start. The band will play from
8 to 11 p.m., but the beer, of course,
will flow until 11:30. Admission will
be $1.00 per person.

Phe ever popular University cock
tail party will be hitting Zollman’s
Buffalo Creek Pavillion on Saturday
afternoon. The refreshment served
will be called grain punch, but
there's no telling how long it will
last so it would be best to come
early. The party is scheduled for
4 until 6 p.m. with a group, Side
show, providing the music. Entrance
will be restricted to those carrying
their class identification cards.

After a quick dinner students can
then rush Doremus Gym-
nasium where Gordon Lightfoot will
be featured in concert by the Uni-
versity Dance Board. Unfortunately,
the 8 p.m. concert must be held in
the older basketball court, because
the entrances to the new gym have
yet to be completed, but the popular
Canadian’s music promises to be a

Concert Impressions: Spring ’71....

Lightfoot Sings

By SKIP PAUKERT

It was a humid, drizzly night in
Washington, the rain making a mud
flat of the capital, where the Mora
torium people had camped the week
before—not a good night for a
concert. But inside massive Consti-
tution Hall they waited, 3,100 of the
faithful (myself included), milling
around their seats, glancing around
for familiar faces, wondering when
the lights would dim and the Big

Canadian would stroll out, their
Lightfoot
And when it was time the audi

ence settled and, with scattered clap
ping, the players emerged: first Red
Shea, lead guitar, with red hair,
grinning. then Rick Haynes, bass
guitar, tall, intent. Then the ap
plause broke loose, and quickly
Lightfoot was out, standing before
the audience, already beating out a
new tune, “The Summer Side of
Life.” on his 12-string Gibson

A broad-shouldered man with a
husky, room-filling voice, he stands
dressed in jeans, big boots, black
vest. He finishes three songs, all
new compositions, before he
a word to the crowd. Then, after
a quiet, carefree version of Kris-
tofferson’s “Me and Bobby McGee,”

Says

one of the two or three songs he
will sing this evening which he
didn't write himself, he eases into

some old Lightfoot favorites, and the
crowd knows them and applauds the
recognizable first chords:

“Softly as she comes

Whispers the breeze with het

passing

In secret love she is laughing

Softly as she comes in the
night.”

And we are quiet, attentive, as
Lightfoot picks gently at the melody
and caresses each word in fine voice,

honest lyrics, poetry. College stu
dents, teeny boppers, business men,
wives, just people, and beards and
jeans, and folk lovers, all listening
humming, catching every word. They
all feel the glow.

Soon, another one they know, an
early Lightfoot original which Peter,
Paul, and Mary made
few years ago, and they love it as
Lightfoot strums and sings:

“In the early morin’ rain

With a dollar in my hand
With an achin’ in my heart
And my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home
And I missed my loved one so,
In the early mornin’ rain.
With no place to go.”

.. Gordon Lightfoot was born
some 33 years ago and grew up in
a little town in the hills of Northern
Ontrio. He finished high school and
faced the inevitable choice of where
he'd go from there. He finally de
cided on a now-defunct music school

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

“Certain qualities distinguish Washington and Lee: Wash-
ington and Lee is small. With an enrollment of about 1500
in its divisions—the College; the School of Commerce, [co-
nomics and Politics; and the School of Law—the University
has remained small by choice. While there is no virtue in
smallness itself, experience has shown that it does encourage
close personal relationships between students and professors
and between students themselves. An atmosphere of friendli-
ness and respect prevails throughout the University. No stu-
dent is lost in the crowd or becomes a victim of ‘assembly-
line’ education.”

Washington and Lee University espouses the philosophy
of remaining a small institution of higher education, But, the
total enrollment is clearly swelling.

Several factors have spurred on this growth. The enroll-
ment of law students has increased sightly from 1965-1971.
The total number of students in the School of Law in 1965
was 194; this year the figure is 252. Yet the School of Law
trend is not too terribly pronounced. For the 1969-70 period
the School of Law enrollment fell to under 190 men, ‘Tucker
Hall is not the scene of the enrollment crime.

A higher percentage of men are graduating from W&L,
which has boosted our enrollment. Fewer men seem to flunk
out, join the service, or simply give up. In essence, more upper-
classmen stay in Lexington than in years past. This pheno-
menon of relatively content upperclassmen is compounded by
more and more transfer students especially from junior col-
leges and community colleges. And certainly, nobody can
forget the new students with skirts, who first attended last
fall. Coeducation has pushed that enrollment total a bit higher.

This year's freshmen class is one of the largest in W&L’s
history. Eight hundred forty-one men were chosen out of
1260 applicants, that is 66.74%. Three hundred fifty-two are
attending.

All these extra students mean several things to the Unt-
versity. Some people would be eager to point out that each
additional undergraduate means an extra $2,200 in Compre-
hensive Tuition Fees. That is a fact, and a good argument
for supplementing our University enrollment with more stu-
dents. But that appears to be the sole argument for increasing
enrollment.

\ larger student body eventually results in a larger demand
for University services: room, board, class space, teachers,
parking lots, and recreational facilities. W&L would welcome
the tuition fees but surely would not welcome the burden of
providing first-rate service to its resident population. The
University dormitories were not plush three years ago, perhaps
with the exception of the New Dorms. The Dutch Inn, Pres-
ton House, and Nelson House have been pressed into service
in recent semesters to hold the overflow of students needing
housing. Those three structures are even desirable
than the Old Dorms. They were either abandoned by private
concerns or were left vacant when fraternities folded,

less

Where will W&L house resident students next year, the
stadium? They have to live somewhere,

How big does W&L want to be? The only answer appears
to be BIGGER. Davidson College, with whom W&L often
is compared, has stabilized its student body at 1000 men.
If W&L is earnest in remaining small, then something must
be done to similarly reverse this growth trend, First, the
University can most easily regulate its size via the Admissions
Office. This may entail the concept of accepting fewer stu
dents, Second, W&L’s hierarchy should determine what the
optimum size for the University should be. Then a suggestion
would be that the University maintain that size and not just
adequately take care of the needs of its students, but rather
make W&L even more attractive by providing first-rate ser-
vices to all its student body,

Currently, the — Interfraternity
Council is studying the present rush
structure with an eye towards pos-
sible adjustments and recommenda-
tions for next year. This activity
has become an annual function of
the IFC’s standing Rush Commit-
tee. Although any proposals which
might be brought forward will not
be tendered for some weeks, a few
conclusions may be drawn from this
year’s rush,

At this writing. statistics indicate
that the 1971 rush was no _ less
successful than last year’s, when al-
most 65% of the freshman class
pledged a fraternity, While the per-
centage of rushees increased this
year (85%) over last year (75%),
roughly the same percentage pledg-
ed, Just over three quarters of the
rushees joined a fraternity. Mean-
while, some twenty-five freshmen
have indicated a desire to defer any
decision concerning fraternity mem-
bership. It would appear that 1971
will resemble 1970 very closely in
terms of Greek rush,

Nevertheless, certain observations
made during rush indicate that some
alterations may be necessary. As is
generally Known, this year’s rush
was reduced from seven weeks to
five since it was found that the
last two weeks of the 1970 rush
were superfluous; most decisions
were made in the first five weeks.
Whether this principle can be ap-
plied this year to the five week
plan remains to be seen. as the com-
mittee is in the process of analyz-
ing rush data on bid acceptances,
house by house. Although the length
of rush was a familiar complaint of
the freshmen, the committee does
not expect to find that a three week
rush would be more beneficial than
one of five weeks on the basis of
critical decision time.

Yet a major criticism of the five
week plan from the freshman point
of view was the dragging nature of
fraternity rush. In response to this,
the committee is considering the
elimination of a set number of open
houses and rush dates in favor of
a somewhat more flexible system of
interaction with the freshmen.

A second complaint common
among the rushees was the lack of
an organized effort to inform the
prospective rushees thoroughly about
rush procedures, This difficulty stems
from two sources. First, the IFC
has had great problems finding a
publisher who can meet a mailing
deadline for the Rush Book. In an
effort to better familiarize freshmen
with rush, the IFC plans to improve
the situation by employing a more
responsible publishing company than
those which have been used in the
past. An IFC committee has been
formed to find a suitable firm.

However, the IFC also intends to
request, on behalf of the incoming
freshmen, the opportunity to explain
procedural matters of rush before
an assembly of freshmen during next
year’s Orientation Week. The cur-
rent University policy, in its at-

 

tempt to be fair to all campus
organizations, is unfair to the fresh-
men themselves, in that they are
at a penalizing information disad-
advantage,

From an administrative point of
view, a more formal method of de-
termining final fraternity pledging
is needed, This year, freshmen re-
sponse to the use of preferential
cards was poor; perhaps this was
due in part to a lack of information
concerning this final procedure,

Already, an ugly consequence of
rush has been resolved. In light of
this year’s Quad riot on the last night
of rush, the IFC passed legislation
which makes the Freshman Quad
area off limits to upperclass fratern-
ity men from eleven o'clock on.
Stiff fines and social probation could
result from the violation of this
rule.

Thus, while the five week plan
served the basic needs for a success-

IOUTLOOKandREView! 771 Fraternity Rush Evaluated

From Various Perspectives
From The I. F. C. President...

From A Rush

By J. HUDSON ALLENDER

Upon returning to Lexington this
past fall, upperclassmen were met
with a somewhat dismaying situa-
tion, The expected rush on the new
gym never materialized and it is
yet a long way from completion. In
addition there was no hurry in
putting the final touches on the new
parking lot. However, where the
University wasn’t really rushing, fra-
ternities on campus were hurriedly
preparing to do so.

Each September at W&L students
return in anticipation of beer at
Goshen, BS sessions of summer ex-
periences, and road trips to Hollins.
By the same token, most fraternity
upperclassmen also arrive on campus
with a dread of a rush chairman’s
orders and a resignment to the
tedium of six unending weeks of
rush. As if the week and a half
preceeding the beginning of classes
isn’t bad enough, filled with scrub-
bing, printing, endless meetings and

From A Freshman...

By PRESTON SIMPSON

As a freshman going through
Rush for the first time, I found
it one of the most interesting ex-
periences of my life. Never before
have I met so many people in so
short a time; but there was more
to it than that. Rush gave me a
valuable lesson not only in the art
of conversing with strangers, but, at
the same time, in evaluating these
strangers and myself.

One of the most difficult aspects
of Rush for me was the simple
problem of finding a conversation
topic of mutual interest to me and
the fraternity members with whom
| was speaking. Yet once that
obstacle had been met successfully,
another presented itself. I had to
decide whether | was compatible
with this group, and IT had to decide
whether | shared with them some
common interests and philosophies.

And at the same time I knew I
was being scrutinized very closely
by the members. Not only did |
have to worry about evaluating
others, | also had to examine my
own strengths and weaknesses, won-
dering how much of each to show.
| suppose the general rule for a
rushee is to be himself, but that
maxim is not so easy to follow
as it is to state. | knew it was
important to let the fraternity
know something about me, but T was
nearly as afraid of making known
my streng points for fear of seem-
ing boastful as | was afraid of
revealing my weaknesses. In fact, I
was often prompted to stop and
examine myself in order to decide
what actually were my strengths and
weaknesses and to consider how they
might be suited to a fraternity.

The structure of Rush leaves little
to be criticized; in general it was
well organized and efficiently run.
| do think it was extended over

too long a time. I would like to see
the same number of Rush dates in

the future, but they should be com-
pressed into a shorter period of
time. However, I do not think |
would like Rush to be only one week
long like it was previous to. last
year. | am glad it lasted a few
weeks so that I had time to think
about certain problems for several
days before having to make decis-
ions. It also gave me a chance to
discuss problems with other people,
both freshmen and upperclassmen,
who helped me resolve doubts and
make up my mind. However, the
process did begin to become mo-
notonous at the end, and for this
reason | think it should be shorten-
ed slightly. I also think Sunday after-

clinics, the only relief is yet six
weeks following. Until then, beer,
potato chips, BS, and more meet-
ings are one’s only comfort.

The actual rush situation itself can
almost be valuable and fun—but
only almost! The initial open houses
and rush dates are informative and
exciting. New faces and ideas are a
novelty to the established regimen
of a fraternity. The conversations are
still fresh and the enthusiasm
genuine, But that soon changes, It
gets to be a drag for all con-
cerned as the dates get longer and
pledge classes form. The only
sources of any kind of pleasure are
those few instances with each date
when a guy pledges or “tears.”
Weekend plans revolve about enter-
taining prime. rushees and keeping
them happy with dates, Freshmen
also soon tire of this routine, For the
last few rush dates there were more
freshmen at Hollins, Baldwin. and
Macon than there were at the fra-
ternities. Who can blame them?

This was, thank God, my last
rush and it went well for our house,
Yet in the face of this success, |
still wouldn't wish the same ex-
perience even on my future father-
in-law, The structure of rush was
hard on the freshmen and even
worse on upperclassmen, After two
weeks or so all was pretty much
anticlimatic. For the most part,
minds have been made up by the
third week and it makes sense that
it should end then, For that small
percentage of rushees who aren't
sure by then there is always de-
ferred rush,

Rush is no longer a rush. True,
there is a better opportunity for dis-
crete selection but I wonder how
many times this opportunity is
utilized. I contend that the-name of
rush should be changed—let’s call
it Drag.

From A Faculty Member . . ,

By DR. THOMAS C, IMESON I

Any opinions or evaluations | may
have of the present fraternity rush
program are derived from a vant-
age point considerably removed
from the focus. As a faculty mem-
ber, my interest in the program only
extends to the point that it touches
the academic endeavors and the gen-
eral tenor of the institution. For the
most part, the actual mechanics and
resultant effects of rush are, I think,
the sole province of the Interfratern-
ity Council and its respective fra-
ternity membership. However, this
does not mean that there exists a
dichotomy between fraternities and
the university vis a vis a rush pro-
gram, for such a program should
work for their mutual benefit with
neither having cause to feel or ex-
perience penalty.

In my opinion the present rush
program is adequate. The extension
of the rush schedule over a period
of five weeks permits the freshman
to place possible fraternity member-
ship within a perspective relative to
his other campus activities. He is not

“Honor System In The Dining Hall"?

subjected to an intensive one week
rush (as previously was the case) and
thereby is not caused to assume the
first legitimate collegiate enterprise
to be fraternities. Therefore, the
rush schedule would seem to be the
Most important aspect of the present
system.

The liberalization, this year, of
the “contact rule” creates a more
realistic climate for relationships be-
tween freshmen and upperclass fra-
ternity members, Fraternities are to
be commended for putting aside
their mutual suspicion and distrust
in the adoption of this attitude.

No doubt, when compared to the
Previous rush schedule, the present
one requires additional expenses and
energies on the point of fraternities.
However if fraternities are to sur-
vive, their membership can not be
drawn from individuals initially act-
ing on @ capricious or hasty decision,
The present rush program would
seem to enable a more rational and
objective judgment on a freshman’s
part.

Draft Deferments
Can Be Dropped

Before December 31

Young men who wish to drop
draft deferments in favor of 1-A
classifications may still do so. Local
boards will continue to grant these
requests even though the young men
continue to meet the conditions for
which the deferments were granted,
Six categories are included: 1-S, high
school students; 2-A, occupational
deferments or vocational/technical
students; 2-C, agricultural defer-
ments; 2-D, divinity students; 2-5,
undergraduate college students; and
3-A, hardship deferments.

This policy was instituted in late
1970 and was of particular interest
fo young men with random sequence
(lottery) numbers above the highest
RSN called for induction, By drop-
ping their deferments at the end of
the year, they became part of that
year's prime selection group, On
January 1, they were placed in a
second priority position. Because of
this, they are not subject to induc-
tion until the manpower supply in
the first priority selection group is
exhausted: a development likely only
if a major national emergency
mecurs

The policy was reaffirmed in a
Local Board Memorandum sent fast
week by Draft Director Curtis W.
Tarr to all 4,000 local draft boards.
Registrants who desire to take ad
vantage of the policy in 1971 must
have been born in 1951 or earlier.

By JOHNNY E, MORRISON

Recently when Vice-President
Agnew was visiting some African
nations he made a statement some-
where along the line that “the Black
leaders in America could learn a
lot from the Black leaders in
Africa.” Maybe Mr. Agnew didn't
know that the civil rights motives
in America and Africa are on dif-
ferent platforms.

I now take the pleasure to school
our great, wise and honorable Vice-
President about the differences of
Black-Power in America and Africa.
(Brutus was an honorable man when
he stabbed Caesar).

First, Mr. Agnew and his sup-
porters must be told that in most
African nations the Blacks comprise
most of the population. In Nigeria
99 per cent, etc, The objectives of
the political movements in these
countries are therefore to capture
the legislative, executive and judicial
branches on a national level. In the
United States Blacks only comprise
around 12 per cent of the popula-
tion and do not claim to or expect
to capture the Supreme Court, Con-
gress and the Presidency for “our-
selves.” Since the objectives are dif-
ferent, so must the strategy also be
different. If the colonial situations
in Africa are to be compared with
the political situations in America
on the same basis then people will
be misled.

We must note that struggle for
Blacks in America is unique. The
appropriate strategies are formed by
the trial and error method because
of this uniqueness, The Black ex-
perience in America is a great trial
therefore a great deal of error is
inevitable. We as Blacks must learn
to make good use of these errors
though. No individual, group,
organization, state or nation is in-
fallible.

The goals and tactics of Black
power in America must be aligned
with the American reality. In re-
spect to integration and equal rights,
the struggle has been in the form
of the Black-Power movement. The
best means for the Blacks to achieve
their share of the fruits is by first
going through a stage of temporary
self-segregation. This is what we as
Blacks mean by “Separation.”

Most of the minorities of America
have passed through a stage of
temporary segregation. America
really is a country where different
people of different races work side
by side without integration, We must
discard the myth of America being
a “melting pot.” Intergration is ac-
complished only between seven
o'clock in the morning and four
o'clock in the evening. This is the
time of the day when both Blacks
and Whites go to work together in
the banks, schools, stores and fac-
tories. After four in the evening
every group returns to its neighbor-
hood. That neighborhood usually has
its own stores, schools and doctors.
Although the Italians and Poles are
both white Catholics they don't dare
to marry each other.

This self-segregation is used by
those who do not want to lose
themselves (cultural identity) in the
American pool. This type of segrega-
tion is a norm of today mainly
because most Americans believe in
cultural pluralism.

Therefore, the Black-Power move-
ment goes along with the American
tradition when we say that there
are certain areas and communities
that are Black neighborhoods where
the Black doctor, preacher, grocer,
teacher, and politician should be
able to fulfill roles which are not
open to them—de facto-—in other
communities,

What Black-Power is saying now
is that both the North and South
should recognize that the official and
middie class jobs in these Black
neighborhoods belong to Blacks who
are not permitted to hold jobs of
this caliber in Gentile, Polish, Italian
or other ethnic communities, What
we as Blacks are saying is “give
us control over our own institutions”

power, Maybe this is why the Blacks
in the South are a “little better off”
than the Blacks in the North. The
Blacks in the South have a little
more control over their community

because of the overt stand of | the
segregationist.

The American economic life is
dominated by a few large corpora-
tions which do the bulk of the busi-
ness. Half of the country’s assets
in manufacturing are owned by
about 100 corporations. We may
find a Black store in the Black
neighborhood but never will we find
a Black General Motors, Penn-Cen-
tral, Standard-Oil Co. or Union
Carbide. We only make up about
12 per cent of the population, In
the African states there should be
a Black General Motors, Penn-Cen-
tral, Standard Oil Co., etc. because
the Blacks there have a vast ma-
jority.

The problem in America is similar
to the economic problem in Africa
but on a smaller scale. Whereas we
comprise about 12 per cent of the
population, we have only 2 per cent
of the jobs at the top, 4 per cent

Letters To The Editor

Robinson Answers Editor

To the Editor:

In your November 10 issue, Edi-
tor-in-Chief Robinson continued his
series of attacks upon the University
Council, He described this group as
“characterized by absenteeism, lack
of discussion, shortage of planning,
loss of direction, and benign ac-
ceptance of University policy.” This
statement is just another example of
the misinformation published by
the Ring-tum-Phi concerning the
University Council.

As for absent members, particu-
larly faculty members to whom Mr.
Robinson refers, there were, to my
knowledge, two faculty members
absent at the October meeting. Both
of them came to me, since I was
Chairman for that meeting, and pre-
sented very valid excuses. Their two
legitimate absences brought the total
of faculty absences to a total of
three for five U. C. meetings.

Concerning the “lack of discus-
sion,” all the sessions of the council,
with the exception of the last one,
have extended past the prescribed
time for termination of debate. This
does not seem to be a “lack of
discussion” to me.

The editorial also mentioned a
“shortage of planning” and a lack
of agenda, For the information of
the Ring-tum Phi, which seems to
have a lack of investigative report-
ing, agendas are handed out to all
interested parties at the start of
each meeting. It is the responsi-
bility of the individual placing a
topic on the agenda to prepare in-
formation for the discussion, and
in most cases, this planning has
been done.

The editorial also refers to the
closed part of the meeting. At this
part of the meeting, minutes of fac-
ulty committee meetings, are dis-
cussed. These minutes include act-
ions of the Committee on Courses
and Degrees and the Faculty Execu-
tive Committee concerning petitions
of individual students. These pro-
ceedings are confidential, and the
students on the U.C. are well aware
of this. There is no reason for the
Ring-tum Phi to be informed of
these actions; it would not benefit
anyone, and could lead to embarass-
ment later.

As for Mr. Allender’s article, |
believe there are also grounds for
dispute, In addition to the false,
grossly misleading headline, Mr,
Allender has his facts a little con-
fused, During the discussions of
parietals in SAC with the dorm
counselors, these men, primarily the
author of the article in question,
assured SAC that the freshman were
very concerned with the ideal of
self-government as well as having
women in their rooms, While talk-
ing to the freshman class officers
in the SAC meeting two weeks later,
self-government was not mentioned
by the freshmen as a reason for the
change in social hours. In fact, these
men denied, when asked, that self-
government Was even a considera
tion of the freshmen. The freshmen
just wanted to have women in their
rooms,

The editorial, as well as the article
on parietals, are marked by poor
factual reporting. Mr, Robinson
states that there was no discussion
on the grade F matter at the U«
If he had attended the September
meeting of the U.C. he would have

been able to listen to a lengthy
debate on the issue. Mr, Allender
states that the SAC vote was 6-4-1.
Only ten members of SAC can vote;
where did the extra vote come
from? The editorial states that “the
student newspaper is a responsible
forum,” and questions whether the
U.C., is one. In my opinion, as well
of that of most other people, the
primary responsibility of a news-
paper is accurate reporting. If the
shoe fits, wear it.

Government Problems

To the Editor:

This university is presently faced
with a series of problems which, if
not solved, may lead to complete
chaos in and disenchantment with
the governing councils of the student
body. In reaction to the difficulties
presented them, the many and varied
governing committees and councils
run around frightened and confused.
Why?

The student government is afraid
to come to grips with any of the
problems. They seem to want to
ignore them and hope that they will
somehow disappear. Different coun-
cils are paranoid about public ex-
posure of the agendas and pro-
cedures of their meetings. There is
no cause for such fright. The gov-
erning councils here are public
forums, not secretive power cliques,

An attempt to hush an issue up
is worse than trying to solve it
openly. If this continues, a public
mistrust of government proceedings
and decisions may result. These com-
mittees and councils are also too
remote from the individual student.
Due to the variety of committees, a
student does not know where to turn
to seek answers or reforms. He has
no clear picture about what is going
on and who is making decisions for
him. The individual student tends to
feel helpless because of this,

Another factor involved in the in-
creasing inefficiency of the govern-
ment is the multiplicity of commit-
tees and councils, On the issue of
parietals alone, two separate com-

mittees would have had legal justi-
fication in handing down a final de-
cision. What would have happened
if both had, and the decisions con-
flicted? Where would the students
turn for the answer? Four separate
committees may call a student in to
answer for his discipline and actions.
The powers and jurisdictions of these
different committees and councils be-
gin to dangerously overlap.

The Honor System, a long cherish-
ed bulwark of the university, is
dying due to the inability of the
governing bodies to cope with the
situation, It is not all the structure's
faults, but the government structure
can not be held blameless. Whoever
dreamt up this system ought to be
ashamed of himself. The system has
conflicting committee jurisdictions,
and a veritable jungle of governing
councils, It seems as if a commit-
tee is created to deal with every
problem that arises.

Last year, as I understand it, an
effort was made to restructure the
government. The effort failed due to
a poor voter turn out, which indi-
cates student apathy. But student
apathy results from a_ frustration
with the government, and an in-
ability to communicate with it. This
is the governing system's fault, not
the students’ fault.

Another cause for the student
apathy could be an ignorance of the
faults in the system. The student
body will not become overly con-
cerned until they are harmed in
some manner by the processes of the
system. By then it will be too late.

A better system would be one
where the power of government is
concentrated into one legislative
body. its officers, and its standing
committees (composed of members
of the legislature). A proportional re-
presentation should be employed,
and the constituencies should be

THE RING-TUM PHI

Page 3

 

By MARC SMALL

It is a curious thing that both
Left and Right can claim that they
alone represent the forces of per-
sonal freedom: while much of this
ambiguity results from mere politi-
cal rhetoric, still a great part of it
comes from conflicting and confus-
ing definitions. The Left of Hubert
Humphrey, for instance, supports the

 

vast corpus of civil rights legisla-
tion which has done much to in-
fringe on the liberties of all in
return for only tokenism, while the
Left of Eugene McCarthy ostensibly
stands opposed to the thoughtless
expansion of federal laws; in the
same way, the Right of Phillip Ab-
bot Luce has repeatedly spoken out
against the draft in opposition to
the Right of Strom Thurmund, In
spite of these seemingly contradic-
tory positions, certain truths can still
be drawn from these often mean-
ingless labels.

It is the conservative who is
loathe to utilize the legislatures as
problem-solving bodies, preferring
instead the “private sector.” It is

ein /\ Sayglass Darkly...
Definitions

   

the conservative who sees each addi-
tional law as another burden on the
individuality of every citizen. It is
the conservative, in short, who feels
that it will ever be impossible to
settle every dispute and problem
that arises, and accordingly thinks
that moderate solutions not disrup-
tive of personal liberty are prefer-
able to drastic legislation which,
more often than not, restricts initia-
tive needlessly while providing tem-
porary and slipshod answers to
eternal conflicts,

The liberal, on the other hand,
sees the central government as a
buffer for the individual against
vague and phantasmagorical oppon-
ents. Whenever a problem arises, the
liberal is often inclined to disavow
any private solution whatsoever, and
seeks heavy-handed solace from the
government: this, obviously, tends to
be a chain reaction that, seemingly
innocuous in the beginning, soon re-

sults in a serious surrender of
rights each time federal help is
sought.

The federal government is a con-
glomeration of humans, each one
susceptible to human frailties and
as imperfect as you and I, It is
as corrupt, as power-mad, as liable
to error as any large corporation,
any labor union, or any other large
and ponderous body. Power, once
yielded to any central authority, is
frequently abused and rarely sur-
rendered: how soon will it be that
we see the end of Nixon's sup-
posedly temporary Phase Two eco-
nomic plans? All too often, it is
the crux of wisdom to restrict
political action to sources outside

not be a member of the extended
priority selection group. Moreover,
they must submit their request in
writing. To be considered as part of
the 1971 prime selection group, the
requests must be postmarked no
later than December 31.

RSN 125 has been set as the year-
end ceiling for 1971 draft calls. Un-
like 1970, when the year-end ceil-
ing was not necessarily reached by
all local boards, the authorization in
the 1971 draft amendments of a
Uniform National Call insures that
all eligible registrants will be con-
sidered for induction if they: (1) are
in Class 1-A on December 31, (2)
are 20 years of age or older on
that date, and (3) have RSNs of 125
or below. If young men meet these
criteria, but are not inducted dur-
ing 1971, their liability for induc-
tion will be extended into 1972.
They will be prime candidates for
induction during the first three
months of the year along with other
men who are now in the extended
priority selection group.

ping of deferments, Dr. Tarr said:
“Young men holding lottery num-
bers of RSN 126 and above can
effectively limit their vulnerability
to the draft by being classified into
1-A by the year’s end. Since the law
allows young men to apply for de-
ferments, we believe those young
men granted deferments should be
able to drop them if they desire.”

“Our purposes” Tarr added, “are
to achieve fairness to all registrants
in determining their priority status
on January | of the mew year and
to limit the uncertainty that young
men with high random sequence
numbers face. Registrants with stu-
dent, occupational, paternity, agri-
cultural, and hardship deferments
will be eligible to take advantage of
this policy.”

The Memorandum also amends
Selective Service policy on allowing
record changes in birthdates upon
submission of adequate evidence.
Starting Dec. 10, if a birthdate
change is submitted after the regis-
trant has received a lottery number,
the records will be changed, but the
registrant will retain his original lot-
tery number.

Former Athletic Director Richard A, Smith and, Supreme Court Nominee Lewis Powell reminisce about old times.

“Cap'n Dick” Remembers
Lewis Franklin Powell, Jr.

Portions of a column by
Chauncey Durden, Richmond
Times-Disptach sports editor, that
appear below are reprinted from
that newspaper.

AMONG THE TELEGRAMS
Lewis F,. Powell Jr. received after
being nominated to the U.S. Su-
preme Court by President Nixon was
the following:

THRILLED FOR YOU, W&L
AND THE COUNTRY. LEIGH
WILLIAMS WOULD APPROVE.

The telegram was signed “Cap'n
Dick.”

“Cap'n Dick” is, of course, Rich-
ard A, Smith, who retired as Wash-
ington and Lee's Director of
Athletics in 1954 after 33 years in
that position. And Cap'n Dick, who
is still going strong in Lexington,
had a story about his telegram to
the distinguished Richmond lawyer
who had to have been, as an under-
graduate at W&L, the youngest re-
cruiter ever “put on the road” by
an athletic director or coach.

“Lewis Powell,” Cap'n Dick re-
called, “was the manager of the foot-
ball team his senior year (1928-29)
at W&L. He was a brilliant young
man with a persuasive tongue and a
marked dedication to whatever was
the job at hand.

“When football practice first began
his senior year, I called him to my
office and said, ‘Lewis, I've got a

Ruggers Trounce Am. U.,
Succumb To Norfolk,
Close Out 2-7 Season

Washington and Lee's Rugby team
split games this weekend to close out
its 1971 season. The Ruggers lost to
Norfolk 10-0 and downed American
University 15-6,

The Blue squad had to endure
back to back games on Saturday
and Sunday. Pacing up to the always
powerful Norfolk Rugby Club on
Saturday, the Blue fought through a
scoreless first half. The big Norfolk
ruggers simply were not able to
break the strong, alert W&L defense
But Norfolk matched the WAL de-
fense, paralyzing the Blue's offensive
game during the first half

Entering the second half, both
teams were hungry for scores. A
couple of mistakes put the play near
the WAL goal line. Then in a play

job for you. An important job that
will take you out of town for a
few days.’

“He said, ‘But I'm the manager
of the team. I'm needed here.’

“Il told him, ‘There is a boy in
Norfolk who is the greatest athlete
in the State. His name is Leigh
Williams and he’s going to VPI
unless we convince him otherwise.
We need him badly here at W&L.
I want you to go to Norfolk and
bring him back with you.”

“I'll do whatever you want me
to do,” he said.

“1 said, ‘Good. Get in that Ford
(the athletic department's one car)
out front and go to Norfolk. Stay
there until you can bring Williams
back, trunk and all.”

“I don’t remember how many days
Lewis was in Norfolk,” Cap'n Dick
continued, “three or four, but
Leigh’s parents fell in love with him.
They agreed W&L was the school
for Leigh—with one proviso. “We'll
let him go with you,’ Mrs, Williams
told Lewis, ‘if he can room with
you.”

“That posed a problem for Lewis
was also manager of Phi Kappa
Sigma fraternity house and had to
live in the house. He worked matters
out by getting Leigh pledged to the
fraternity and the two roomed to-
gether.”

Thus did undergraduate Lewis
Powell recruit. and “land” Leigh
Williams who, in Cap'n Dick's
words, “was the greatest all-round
athlete in W&L’'s history.”

Williams was a fine end in foot-
ball, a good baseball player and
track man, but basketball was his
strongest sport. He stood three or
four inches over six feet, which
height made him a “tall ‘un” for
those years. Cap'n Dick was WA&L’s
basketball coach back then. He says
Williams was the best player in the
South.

“Leigh was almost a one-man
team,” Cap'n Dick said yesterday
“We had no subs, that is subs who
could play basketball, We made a

the small college classic, the Knute

one game all year, and that game by
one point. Washington and Lee has
shocked quite a few teams over the

LaRue’s Pressbox
Picking the Bowl Games

By ROB “LASH” LaRUE

It would be absolutely insane for
me to try to forecast any bowl
games at this point, since so much
has yet to be decided. But insanity
seems to be this columnist only
virtue, and I will therefore attempt
to untangle the 1971 football snarl.
One thing is practically certain -
this year’s bowl games, for a change,
will feature some strong teams.
None of this 6-5 stuff which we
had to suffer through last year,

The two weakest games will be
the Rose Bowl and the Cotton Bowl.
In each of those games, at least
one team has been beaten twice.
In the Rose, Stanford will take on
Michigan. In Dallas, a sub-average
Texas squad will probably host
Georgia.

The Orange Bowl and the Sugar
Classic are looking to be the big
ones this year. The Orange will in
all likelihood feature a pair of un-
beatens and will probably be the
conclusive battle for setthement of
the No. | position. The winner of
the Big Eight Conference, either
Oklahoma or Nebraska, will meet
the winner of the Alabama-Auburn
contest, for the Orange game, while
the two losers will travel to New
Orleans for the Sugar Bowl.

Think that sounds right? | don't
either, and here’s why. Penn State
has to go somewhere, especially if
it stay unbeaten. Now if Tennessee
can bump off the Nittany Lions,
then the problem is solved, as the
Pennsylvanians would likely end up
Gator Bowl bound. If Penn State re-
mains undefeated, they could re-
place Alabama or Auburn in either
the Sugar or the Orange, sending
these teams elsewhere, Penn State
could conceivably look westward to
the Cotton, but the Dallas im-
presarios would be loathe to give
the Nittanies a shot at a weak Texas
team.

The bowl picture becomes a little
more clear (?) when looked at in
these terms:

Rose Bowl—Stanford v. Michigan

Cotton Bowl—Texas v. Georgia

Orange Bowl—winner, Oklahoma-
Nebraska v. winner, Auburn-Ala-
bama

Sugar Bowl—loser, Oklahoma-Ne-
braska or loser, Auburn-Alabama v.

Ruggers Win One, Lose One

(Continued from page 5)
characterized by mass confusion,
with the ball popping in and out of
players’ hands and then bouncing
into the end zone, Norfolk scored,
as both a W&L rugger and a Nor-
folk one simultaneously downed the
ball. The extra point was good, and
the Blue trailed 6-0. The Blue were
out to get the score back, and suc-
ceeded in two breakaway runs, only
to have the man stopped near the
opposing goal and the ball rapidly
returned downfield by the well
organized Norfolk club. It was just
such a play that set up the final
Norfolk try. But the kick-after-try
failed. For the remainder of the
game the Blue tried valiantly to
score but were always stopped by
the big Norfolk defense. The Blue
defense held Norfolk far from the
goal and when the final whistle blew,
Norfolk had a victory, 10-0, keep-
ing their record blemished by only
one loss this year.

Sunday, saw the Blue again suited
up for action to face American Uni-
versity. The Blue came out on the
field looking good right away. The
Blue defense crippled the American
University offense. Even more im-
portant the Blue moved the ball
forward, and the action for the
entire first half took place on the
A.U. side of the field. The Blue
brought the ball in hear the goal
line twice before Mike Truda, with
the weight of the entire scrum be-
hind him, finally scored. Fred
Fletcher kicked the extra point, and
the Blue led 6-0. Action was much
the same soon after and it was not
long before goal line action de-
veloped again. Bill Martin took it
in for the try. Fred Fletcher again
made the kick-after-try good and
the Blue had a solid 12-0 lead.

But then, with the first half nearly
over, the W&L club got the wrong
end of a bad break. A kicked ball
hit an American University rugger
and bounced high over the head of
the W&L defenders who were farth-
est back. An A.U. rugger already
sprinting upfield grabbed the ball

vision, a computer-like mind to keep
track of ever-emerging new. situa-
tions, and an innate sense of pinball
strategy.” Hindsley went on to point
out that, while a novice’s game
might be finished in a few seconds,
a player blessed with the tools can

make a dime last an entire after-
noon,
Hindsley has complemented his

keen insight into the sport’s mores
with the operation of five machines
in Lexington. Of these, his favorite
is “Paul Bunyan,” which is situated
in the basement of the PIKA house.
“This machine has six flippers,”
Hindsley points out, “exemplifying
the technological achievement that
put man on the moon.” With a bow
to sentiment, Hindsley went on to
point out that the machine also fea-
tures chimes similar to those heard
in churches.

Kelly Buell, also a senior, stressed
the amusement aspect of the activity
while firing shot after shot at a
confusing array of changing patterns,
permutations and “features” in a
downtown Lexington machine. He
has watched individuals battle ma-
chines for as long as four hours
at a stretch.

Keith Shaner. (cheer up, he's just

interviewers who have badgered him

young pinball superstar consented to
ask himself the question, “Why do
I go back?”

Shaner cited the challenges of
pinball as the sport's fundamental
drawing card. “It's all the same,”
he points out, “there are no alibis,
the machine can destroy anybody.”

Gamesmanship is a special forte
of Shaner, who calls “Aces and
Kings” at the Quid his home ma-
chine. “I like to go first,” he says,
and then watch my opponent try
to catch up.”

Like Hindsley, Shaner views pin-
ball as a true test of atheltic capa-
bilities, a contest calling for timing.
fingertip dexterity, mental toughness,
and body control,

Students are not the only indivi-
duals touched by pinball influence.
Mr. James Toler of the University
Co-op, admits he had misgiving
when he introduced pinball about
two years ago. “I was hesistant at
first, and could use the space for
something else. But the students
seem to enjoy it to quite an extent,
and as long as they seem to enjoy
it, Tm for it. fm not against some
revenve on it either.”

When operative, (at this writing
the Co-op pinball assembly is tem-
porarily incapacitated) the conces-
sion nets between $40 and $50 a
week .which is divided between the
Co-op and the company that pro-
vides the machines. Mr. Toler has
noticed that the same people seem
to frequent his machine and he at-
tempts to change the unit occasion-
ally to insure variety.

Ernie Lawhorne of The Para-
mount Inn believes his four machine
compiex is a financial succes. An
accomplished pinballer himself.
Ernie finds it a “great game,” but
one whose intricate skills can be
accomplished only through rigorous
practice

Hence pinball appears to be a
true bond between generations in
this troubled era. It seems to pro
true enjoyment. as well as
aiding an individual to develop
qualities crucial in laier life: self-
discipline, patience. devotion to
something greater than oneself

Yet pinball. like any other pres
sure packed athletic endeavor, pos
its detractors. One student
admitied pinball was “a tremendous
fad. everywhere,” and could be play
ed for “pride and amusement.” At
the time. however, he
forced to admit that his own career
was at an end. Looking on wistfully
as a friend rolled a high, satisfying
the ex-ballplayer acknowledg
ed. “I used to play a lot, but it's
addictive.”

that they were inconvenient for
freshmen and fraternity members
alike.

I came to college woefully inept
and inexperienced in the art of

although Rush has hardly made me
an expert at it, the process did
give me much-needed practice in

Lightfoot Highlights
Openings Weekend

100,000 copies in Canada alone. His
songs have been recorded by the
likes of Bob Dylan, Judy Collins,
Glen Campbell, Barbra Streisand,
Johnny Cash, and Richie Havens.

And now, more than two hours
have passed (swiftly), after an encore
of his Top Ten single, “If You
Could Read My Mind,” the end of
his concert approaches.

The Great Song is coming. the one
he wrote for the Canadian Centen-
nial Celebration, an exciting, tradi-
tional ballad written in an age when
genuine folk songs are rare....
Lightfoot begins his “Canadian Rail-
road Trilogy”

“There was a time in this fair land

when the railroad did not run,/

When the wild majestic moun-

tains stood alone against the
sun./

Long before the White Man, and

long before the wheel./

When the green dark forest was

too silent to be real.”

The spotlight shines on the man,
his forehead sparkling with beads
of sweat, his big hands beating out
the locomotive rhythms, Red Shea's
fingers flying fast over his guitar,
the sound—flowing, full, rolling out
to us... And everyone leaning for-
ward attentive,

“We are the Navvies who work

upon the railroad, /

Swinging our hammers in the

bright blazin’ sun./

Livin’ on stew and drinking bad

whiskey, /

Bending our backs till the

railroad is done.”
With the last stanzas, the song ends,
and the applause breaks out, loud
and grateful. Lightfoot smiles, nods,
says thanks. I'm on my feet, then
he’s gone...

I still cherish that concert. |
think about the songs, the energy,
the electricity of a performer really
committed to sharing his life with
audience. Lyrics that reach out to

Yes, I've felt that way, also.”

Outlook Good

For Admissions

By ANDREW SIMPSON

At a time when many of the 352
freshmen of the Class of 1975 are
still settling down to college life,
news comes from the Director of
Admissions, James Farrar, that 55
early decision candidates have al-
ready been accepted for the Class
of 1976,

The 55 were chosen from a field
of 70 early decision applicants and
represent the highest number of
early decision candidates ever ac-
cepted by Washington and Lee. In
1967, 47 such candidates were ac-
cepted, the greatest number before
the Class of 1976 figures. Judging
from past experience, Dean Farrar
expects “all of the 55” to enroll at
Washington and Lee next September,

As far as regular admissions for
the Class of 1976 is concerned,
Dean Farrar notes that, “the figures
are still a little bit ahead of last
year’s.” As of November 11, 272
applications for regular admissions
had been received, which is an in-
crease of 15 applicants over last
year’s figures for the same date. Al-
though Dean Farrar cautions against
overemphasizing the significance of
this increase at such an early date,
he is optimistic that the trend. the
“good news,” will continue.

Virginia, on the rise in Atlantic
Coast Conference circles, will be a
rugged opponent for the gym’s open-
ing encounter. The Cavaliers went
15-11 last year, their first winning
season in 17 campaigns. Coach Bill
Gibson is blessed with a strong re-
turning cast, including a proven big
man in 6'10° Scott McCandlish and
a strong All-American candidate in
junior guard Barry Parkhill.

Washington and Lee will counter
with ten returning lettermen from
last year's solid 17-8 club, Captain
Mike Daniel, who passed the 1,000
career point plateau at the close of
last season, will lead the Generals
into tonight's encounter. Coach
Verne Canfield’s squads have posted
five straight winning seasons.

Tip-off time for the varsity game

is 8:30 p.m. The Washington and
Lee freshmen face the Cavayearlings
at 6:00 p.m.

Prior to the game, a brief “tip-off”
ceremony, featuring remarks by
President Robert E. R. Huntley and
visiting dignataries will be con-
ducted.

Phe $3.25 million addition includes
facilities for all of Washington and
Lee’s winter athletic teams, as well
as other additional features, The new
gym currently seats about 2200 fans
and can eventually be expanded to
a capacity of 4000.

Also included in the new building
is a six lane, 75° swimming pool.
Seating capacity for this area is
roughly 250.

A spacious new wrestling practice
room is also a new addition, al-
though most home matches will be
held in the new gym. The wrestling
squad conducted elimination bouts
to pick its starting lineup this after-
noon.

Also housed in the addition are ten
handball and squash courts, a new
weight room which includes a uni-
versal gym, a sauna bath, new team
and locker room space, and offices

2 THE RING-TUM PHI

Page

 

 

Tonight is the “inaugural event” for Doremus Gymnasium,
All the folks in the Athletic Department would quickly add
that “inaugural event” is not synonymous with “grand open-
ing.” A great deal of the work is still uncompleted. Nonethe-
less, the New Doremus facilities are partially finished, as evi-
denced by this evening's basketball game against the Univer-
sity of Virginia.

The grandiose expansion of the antiquated Doremus Gym-
nasium into an athletic complex has been costly for Washing-
ton and Lee University. Three million dollars is no meager
sum in this era of tight money. Yet, W&L appropriated
$3,000,000 in addition to its current operating budget in order
to give the school a first-rate basketball court and swimming
pool, Construction of the new wing to Doremus spanned an
approximate two year period. During these months, parking
spaces vanished, roads became muddy ruts, and inconvenience
often abounded. Old Doremus was largely shut down for
renovation. W&L men lacked locker facilities, showers and
dressing rooms. Physical Education participants were told to
take showers in the dormitories.

But the costs of New Doremus in terms of dollars, time and
inconveniences are balanced by undeniable benefits. The in-
tercollegiate athletic teams are the most obvious beneficiaries,
The basketball, swimming and wrestling coaches can finally
show prospective athletes the inside of the gym, It used to be
that high school athletes were rushed by the 1915 structure
with hopes they would not want a closer glimpse. Intramural
athletes are able to calm their athletic frustrations in the vast
labyrinth that is Doremus. In years past IM sports took a
back seat to the varsity sports. There simply was not enough
time or space to let intramural and intercollegiate basketball

more tickets mean more money ; more money means better en

letics, intramurals, the Mock Convention or the Dance Board,
you can take solace, You may just saunter into the red brick
monolith and swim or shoot baskets unhindered by teams or

hundreds of would-be or has-been jocks.

Doremus is almost through, its completion is imminent.
But once the finishing touches have been completed on the $3
million structure, what will come next?

Other physical improvements and construction are crit-
ically required if W&L wishes to remain a superior university.
The list below outlines some of the specific needs of the school.

*\ LIBRARY. The Cyrus Hall McCormick Library is in-
adequate. Even with some of the 235,000 volumes farmed out
to six departmental collections, McCormick is terribly cram-
med full of books, magazines, study areas and classrooms. The
Music and Sociology Departments are housed under the
McCormick roof, due to a lack of space. Washington and Lee
has hired an industrious librarian, Maurice Leach, who has
purchased a considerable number of volumes. But the ques
tion remains unanswered—where can the books go? A new li-
brary, not a library-classroom-studyhall conglomerate is des

perately needed,

*DORMITORIES “The Old Freshman Dormitory is not
conducive to studying, sleeping or even showering at times
W&L requires most entering freshmen to live in this structure.
It is not on par with the dorms at many, many universities in
the nation, Aside from the freshman problem, few upperclass
men can be accommodated in John W. Davis Hall. With an
expanding undergraduate population and a decreasing apart
ment market, the university should try and give more upper
classmen students a place to live. Despite the need for both

BY STEPHEN C. WOODRUFF

With tonight's inauguration of the
new $3.25 million addition to Dore-
mus gymnasium—complete — with
tours, open house, basketball game,
and pre-game “tip-off” ceremony by
President E. R. Huntley and visiting
dignitaries—Old Doremus seems to
fade off into oblivion.

Yet Old Doremus is more than
just the place where, up to now,
W&L students worked out and ath-
letic competitions took place. Some-
how the spirit and tradition of Wash-
ington and Lee and the two men for
which the University was named are
integrated into the concrete, wood,
and steel of its structure.

For Old Doremus sprang, almost
full-blown, from that pervasive spir-
it. It stands as a monument to an
unknown student who was friendly
to a casual visitor, That student plac-
ed his books on the ground and of-
fered to escort the visitor around
campus, identifying the points of in
terest. That visitor happened to be
Robert Parker Doremus of New
York.

Mr. Doremus was so impressed
with the student's action that upon
his return to New York, without
ever speaking with any University
official, he made provision that, upon
the death of his wife, his entire
estate should go to W&L.

In 1913, after Mr. Doremus’ death,
Mrs. Doremus donated, in memory
of her husband, the gymnasium com
plete with pool, at a cost of $100,
000. Former athletic director Cy
Twombly believes it would cost “a
million and a half” to build the same
gym today. At that time, it was the
finest gym in the South. With the
death of Mrs, Doremus, the entire
estate of $1.5 million came to the
University, the largest single gitt in
the history of W&L.,

The story is not just another leg
end, another part of the Washington
and Lee mythology, as some now
believe the Honor System and the
and tie, even the W&L “gen
tleman” are. No, the story has been
verified by Mrs. Doremus’ sister to
Dean Emeritus Gilliam, and stands
as a memorable moment in W&L's
216-year history.

coal

But the magic of Old Doremus
doesn't end with the story of its
aquisition. For many, like Coach

Twombly and Cap'n Dick, former
athletic directors, the gym holds
many memories, memories of an era
of WAL athletic greats and old-time
problems. Just to begin to mention a
few

In 1936, the National Collegiate
Wrestling Championships were held
there. It was the days when Okla-
homa and Oklahoma State were the
wrestling powerhouses. Oklahoma
won that year, but WAL didn't go
out the back door unnoticed. The
Blue put a man in the finals to vie
for honors as a heavyweight. A
good many Southern Conference

Wrestling Championships were held
there throughout the years when
W&L and V.M.I. dominated the
wrestling in the Southern Confer
ence. As Coach Twombly tells it;
“Yeah. We held the final affair a
good many times in the gym. One
year going into the finals, we had
every one of W&L’s wrestling team
going into the finals, except the
heavyweight. And most of them
won.” And the gym served to house
some major prep school tourneys
back in those years, especially South
Carolina and Woodrought, Under its
roof practiced the South’s first box-
ing and wrestling teams—an honor
shared with U.Va.

Coach Twombly remembers also
a pastime of nearly all the students,

And the renowned Mock Conven-

what it was like to be athletic direc

that though; it’s just like a real con-

licate. They'd get red ink and cigar-

to give me a fit.” But Old Doremus
withstood it all, took it all in,
like W&L, benefited from it.

Selective Service Revisions Explained

BY CURTIS W. TARR

The agent for progress and im-
provement is participation. The Se-
lective Service System has undergone
many significant changes in the past
two years, Many of the changes are
directly attributable to the young
men and women who participated
responsibly during this difficult per-
iod of change.

Our chief mechanism for this
youth involvement has been the Se-
lective Service Youth Advisory Com-
mittees, Established in every state
across the country, the groups have
discussed the ideas, suggestions and
criticisms of youth on a wide variety
of draft topics.

The new draft law and regula-
tions reflect nearly two dozen signi-
ficant changes in the system, Of the
thirty-six suggestions put forward by
over 600 youth advisers, eighteen
have been implemented by law or
regulation. Six are being studied
further for possible future imple-
mentation. Ten were beyond the
jurisdictional control of the Selec-

 

 

tive Service System and were refer-
red to the Executive Branch or Con-
gress for consideration. Only two
were disapproved.

One of the more important changes
brought about concerned the age of
local draft board members. The
youth committees suggested lower
ages and a curtailment of the length
of service on local boards. Regula-
tions previously stated that citizens
could not be appointed to local
boards unless they were at least 30
years old. They could not serve be-
yond their 75th birthday or for more
than 25 years. The new regulations
and law limit service on local draft
boards to 20 years and set a maxi-
mum age of 65 years. A minimum
age of 18 has been set for appoint-
ment to local boards,

In accord with our youth advisers’
recommendations, the new law abo-
lished student deferments for all col-
lege students who were not enrolled
during the 1970-1971 academic year.
In other words, from now on, no
more college deferments will be

granted. But the law also provides
that both undergraduate and gradu-
ate students who receive induction
orders will have their inductions
postponed until the end of their cur-
rent academic term, quarter, or se-
mester, A student in his last acade-
mic year can have his induction post-
poned until the end of the school
year, allowing him to graduate.

The advisers were concerned that
draft calls varied from community to
community ,and they sought a more
uniform approach to selecting men
for service.

In the past a system based upon
total registration was used to ap-
portion the national draft call to the
state headquarters, who in turn ap-
portioned the call to individual local
draft boards, The new regulations
removed the requirement to use this
system and instead established a uni-
form national call. Now all young
men in the nation with the same lot-
tery numbers who are available will
receive induction notices at nearly
the same time.

It was recommended that young
men be afforded a judicial review of
appeals to local and state boards in
classification matters, The new law
provides a realistic move in this di-
rection, permitting a young man ap-
pealing his classification to bring
witnesses and present his appeal to
a quorum of the board. The young
man also is allowed now to make a
personal appearance before the Sen-
ate and Presidential appeal boards.
Further, a registrant can require a
board to give him a written explana-
tion of its denial of his claim.

Among our advisers were con-
scientious objectors who believed
that they should be provided an op-
portunity to work in jobs that betier
serve the national health, interest
and welfare. Under the old law con-
scientious objectors performing al-
ternate civilian service were under
the control of local draft boards.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

W&L Ends 4-5 Season Beating Washington, 38-6

BY LEWIS HIXSON

The Washington and Lee Generals
ended their season Saturday, Novem-
ber 13 with an impressive victory
over Washington University in St.
Louis. This was the fourth’ win. in
the last five games for the Generals
giving them a 4-5 record on the
season.

The General defense must once
again be commended for an excel-
lent job as it gave up zero points
to the Washington offense and tal-
lied six points of its own. The Blue
offense must also be congratulated as
it more than doubled its opponent in
total yardage. There were many in-
dividual’ heroes for’ the Generals.
Steve Fluharty hit on ten of 14 for
101 yards and a touchdown. Tom
Van Amburgh gained 152 yards on
30 carries and scored three touch-
downs; one coming on a 13 yard
pass play. Chappy Conrad caught
seven passes tO finish the season
with a total of 47 receptions for 573
yards, Jim Farrar picked up 51
yards in only five carries to-average
over ten yards a shot. Marshall
Washburn intercepted a Washington
pass and retutned it 63 yards for a
touchdown. Dave Brooks and Tim
Haley also had a good game on
defense as they ended up the year
with the most tackles. For the
season Brooks totaled 89 tackles
and Haley had 85 tackles to his cred-
it,

Washington University © “scored
first on a fluke play midway into
the initial period. A’ pitchout in-
tended for Van Amburgh was picked
off by Poelker for Washington who
carried it 75 yards for a score. The
conversion was unsuccessful ~ and
Washington held an carly lead, 6-0.

Neither team: was able te get into
the end zone again before half.

In the third quarter W&L got a
break when Scott Neese fell on a
fumble at the Washington 40. Flu-
harty then drove the Blue offense
downfield mixing passes with runs by
Van Amburgh to gain needed yard-
age. Van Amburgh finally got the
tally with a plange over right tackle.
The point after was good by Chase
and at the end of the third quarter
the score had the Generals up by a
single point 7-6.

In the fourth quarter everything
broke loose, as far as the Generals
were concerned, as they scored 31
points by capitalizing on mistakes
by Washington. Doug Chase led off
things by kicking a 31 yard field
goal with 9:32 left in the game. The
next score came on a ten yard pass
from Fluharty to Conrad, That
made it W&L 17, Washington 6
with 6:16 remaining in the quarter.

WAL kicked off to Washington
who held it for six plays before
Washburn picked off a pass at the
W&L 37 and returned it all the way
for a touchdown. The ‘point ‘after
put the Blue ahead 24-6,

It took Washington only one play
to give up the ball at their own 29,
as Jon Markley fell on a loose ball
for the Blue. Then, it only seemed
fitting, that the Generals would take
one play to score. Van Amburgh
seampered around:end for the 29
yards needed to put the game out of
reach. The conversion was true once
again and with only 2:29 left on the
clock; thé Blue team led, 31-6. It
had taken the Blue only 18 seconds
to score two touchdowns. The Gen-
crats managed to score once more in
the last play of the game on a 13

yard pass from David Otey to Van
Amburgh. The final score read:
W&L 38—Washington 6.

Washington and Lee University’s
turnaround. football. season should
serve notice on next year’s oppon-
ents: the Generals will be tough in
1972.

Coach Buck Leslie’s team lost the
first four games of a very tough
schedule, but then jelled to win four
of the last five, including impressive
victories over Coast Guard and
Washington University of St. Louis.

Most of the team returns for next
year. Only nine of the 62-member
squad are seniors,

The Generals capped off the turn-
around’ season with last. Saturday's
38-6 victory over Washington, rally-
ing from a 6-0 halftime deficit. The
score was still only 7-6 after three
quarters, the Generals exploding for
31 points in the fourth quarter.

“| think the turning point of the
season was the Bucknell game,” said
Coach Leslie. Although the Generals
lost, 27-0,-they moved the ball well
against the much bigger Bisons, par-
ticularly in the second half.

“The team felt they could play
in a tougher league,” Leslie explain-
ed. “The first victory followed the
next week against Western Mary-

land, and from there it was a matter
of momentum.”

The season’s statistics bear out the
reversal, By season’s end, the Gen-
erals had held their own or out-
gained the opponents in all cate-
gories, including scoring. Surpris-
ingly, thanks to the last two games,
W&L gained more yardage on the
ground than in the air.

The ground-gaining was shared
about equally among four runners:
senior JoJo Martin compiling 315,
soph Jim Farrer 305, junior Tommy
Van Amburgh 248 and junior Lat
Purser 236,

Meanwhile, the passing game, pac-

ed by junior quarterback Steve Flu-
harty and junior receiver Chappy
Conrad, was equally as impressive.
Fluharty completed 74 of 170 passes
for 940 yards and seven touchdowns.
Conrad caught most of them, 47,
for 573 yards and four scores,

Ihe kicking game also played an
important part, Conrad consistently
got off long, booming punts, averag-
ing over 40 yards a kick. Sophomore
placement specialist Doug Chase was
perfect on extra points, 18 for 18,
and hit three of five field goals to
end up the leading scorer,

All of the above players, except

W&L Opens With U.Va;
' Tournament Comes Next

Although Washington and Lee
might have a slight home court ad-
vantage in tonight’s game, Bill Gib-
son’s team from the University of
Virginia has to be favored, The pre-
season word from Charlottesville is
that the Cavaliers will be even bet-
ter than last year when the Wahoos
fashioned a 15-11 record, their first
winning season in 17 years,

Included was a 92-70 breeze past
WAL in University Hall, a game in
which talented sophomore guard
Barry Parkhill (they call him “Mr.
B.P.”) killed the Generals early with
his scoring and steals, Already draft-
ed by the pros, the rangy, 6-4 play-
maker is back to do his thing out
front, and that merely entails shoot-
ing a basketball perhaps better than
any guard in the country. It’s a sure
thing he'll be the best player to hit
Lexington this season.

With big, 6-10 Scott McCandlish
lurking underneath, the Wahoos are
a balanced outfit, with plenty of ex-
perience to go around, Besides Park-
hill and McCandlish, two other start-
ers from last year’s team return
guard Tim Rash and forward Frank
DeWitt—and they are joined by a
newcomer, 6-7 sophomore forward
Bob McCurdy, who averaged 24.9
points a game with the Baby Cava-
liers last winter, Other top talent
comes from Jim Hobgood, Bob Me-
Keag, Lanny Stahurski, and Lexing-
ton’s Chip “Litthe Weenie” Miller,
son of a former W&L_ basketball
coach, L. F. “Weenie” Miller.

The Generals will counter with an
experienved (10 lettermen) team that
features considerable balance and
depth. although short on height. Sen
ior forward Mike Daniel, the W&l
capta'n, had a 19.1 scoring average
last year aud looked impressive in a
recent workout against VMI. He's an
aggressive sort who doesn’t mind
driv'ng against taller men, a char-
acteristic that will be put to a severe
test here tonight, Daniel will have to
be in top form if W&L hopes t>
eve Virginia a good game.

At 6-8, junior center Paul Me
Clure has the potential to neutralize
McCandlish. McClure did it often in
last year’s game, and this particular
match-up will be important to the
Generals this evening. McClure was
a vital ingredient in W&L’s 17-8
record last year, the Generals’ fifth
straight big winning season, albeit
against competition not quite on the
same level as the ACC-member
Wahoos,

Besides Daniel and McClure, the
lettermen include seniors John
Glace, Ellis Gutshall, and Dave
Stone; juniors Hatton Smith, Doug

SPORTS
FHORTS
SHORT:

Coach Buck Leslie revealed the
bizarre circumstances of WAL’s last
play touchdown against Washington
University. Leslie told the officials
that only the quarterback could call
timeouts. With only seconds left and
the Generals way ahead, David Otey
went into the game for the Blue, He

asked how much time was left and
the officials thought amid the con

(Continued on page 6)

Clelan, Charlie Strain, and John
Dumas; and sophomore Skip Licht-
fuss, The only newcomer is senior
guard Scott Wood, a likely starter
who returns after a year’s absence.

If anything is going to be changed
this year, Verne Canfield says it’s
going to be the way his team con-
ducts itself on the floor, not in be-
havior but in style of play. Once
known as a ball control club, with
an emphasis on defense, please, the
new Generals are going to open it
up with fast breaks (remember those)
and a gung-ho offense with points
in mind,

With that considered, and appreci-
ating the fact that Virginia has a
pretty fair running attack of its own,
then fans at tonight’s game should
get their money’s worth, One thing
is certain. Things should be loud,
what with these two teams getting
together in Lexington, The last time
Virginia tried playing W&L here,
the Wahoos were lucky not to have
been tarred-and-feathered, so ada-
ment was the crowd to see their de-
mise, Which it helped along, 78-68.

W&L Tournament

Host Washington and Lee will
play Lycoming, and Drexel will op-
pose West Virginia Tech, in the first
round of the W&L Invitational Bas-
ketball Tournament Friday night.

“aa

The third annual tournament will

Gymnasium. Games are scheduled
for 7:00 and 9:00 p.m. each night.
An all-tournament team and Most
Valuable Player will be announced
following Saturday night’s champion-
ship game.

All four teams appear about even,

for the tournament. W&L and Ly-

coming have met just once before,’

in the opening round of the 1967
Randolph-Macon Tournament, with
Lycoming winning, 78-70. The Gen-
erals recently split a pair of games
with West Virginia. Tech, winning
47-36 at W&L three years ago and
losing, 85-70, at Tech two years ago.
The Generals and Drexel have never
met,

W&L will be led by 6-3 senior
forward Mike Daniel, the team cap-
tain who averaged 19.1 points a
game last year and ranks sixth on
the all-time. W&L career scoring
list with 1,034 points.

West Virginia Tech, in a rebuild-
ing year, is paced by 6-3 John Gour-
ley, who averaged 18.2 points a
game last year. Lycoming has a raft
of sophomores, the best of them 6-4
Rich Henninger, who scored 503
points last year as a freshman.
Drexel is paced by 5-10 guard Jerry
Glick, who averaged 14.1 points a
game last year, and 6-4 forward

Vince Morrison, who averaged 12.1.

 

Eid

WAL's top returnce is senior Mike Daniel who averaged 19.1 points
last season. Standing 6-3 Daniel was the second leading rebounder with

an 8.6 mark.

Old Doremus its magic, some will
see this article as a last memorial to
Old Doremus, But | would hope not.
Creditable as it may seem, I have no
desire to have written Old Doremus’
eulogy. No, Old Doremus must live
on, held up by its heritage and sym-
bolizing what W&L was, is, and
must remain. And | would hope,
that the new addition, although not
yet formally dedicated, will with to-
night’s game begin to assimilate
through the activities to be held in
it the same spirit and tradition that
now lives in Old Doremus, And that
years from now, the new addition
will be so steeped in that heritage
that “New” and “Old” Doremus will
merge into one, simply Doremus.

two great traditions, living on in that
heritage, and safe in General Lee's

Armstrong, and Rolf Piranian, W&L
has never placed as many men on
the All-Star roster before. After a
series of losses early in the season,
the soccer team won four out of
their last six contests to finish 5-6.

Baseball practice commences in

New Boxwoods

By PAUL LANCASTER

“The gift enabled us to get bushes
we otherwise could not have dream-
ed of having...” This was the
consensus of Mr, Farris Hotchkiss,
Director of University Development,
on the recent addition of 36 English
Boxwood shrubs to the W&L
campus,

Mr. Hotchkiss said that the shrub-
bery was a gift of Wilmer S. Poynor,
of Birmingham, Alabama, whose
son, John, was a 1962 graduate of
the University, Hotchkiss noted that
“18 months ago, Poynor found
these specimen bushes in Wytheville,
Virginia,” and, in gratitude to the
University, he donated them,

Hotchkiss cited the value of the
English Boxwoods, “They cost up
into the thousands of dollars per
bush,” he stated. “It's a gift of
tens of thousands of dollars.”

“You can't plunk English Box-
woods down anywhere,” the Director
of Development continued, “Our
campus is one of the few places (in

Hotchkiss could not praise the
valuable donation enough. “In these
(the boxwoods), Poynor has given
us a gift that is unusual in subject

. it has benefited the university
in an extremely valuable way.”

He emphasized the value of these
particular English Boxwoods in rela-
tion to other species. “The English
Boxwood grows much more slowly
than the American variety, and it
is therefore much more valuable.”
Hotchkiss also cited the size of the
bushes as another major factor in
the worth of the shrubs,

As for the total cost of the
project to the University, W&L paid
for the transportation of the bushes
from Wytheville and the installation
of the bushes. This cost, Hotchkiss
noted, was minimal with respect to
the overall value of the gift.

Draft System Undergoing

Significant Changes

(Continued from Page 3)
mum age requirements of the law.
While the draft system will suffer
from the loss of these dedicated men
and women, we are eager to take
advantage of this opportunity to re-
place them with young men and
women reflecting the ethnic, educa-
tional and social backgrounds of reg-
istrants across the nation,

Appointed by the President upon
the recommendation of the state
governor, the local board member
holds, perhaps, the most important
position in the Selective Service Sys-
tem. A young man or woman who
might be interested in serving on a
local board or in assuming other
volunteer positions in the Selective
Service System should contact the
office of his or her governor.

Many young people are asking
themselves these days with a greater
degree of seriousness than was dis-
played by previous generations
where their values lay, what activi-
ties make their lives meaningful, and
how they can better contribute to
society. | hope that many young
men and women will recognize these
new opportunities to serve in the Se-
lective Service as a worthwhile
means of social involvement and
public service, We need their help.

Those familiar with Jean Cocteau
can witness his first venture into the
medium of film as a form of expres-
sion, “The Blood of the Poet.” The
well-known work will be presented

charge to students and faculty at
8:30 p.m. next Wednesday.

the team will get more scoring sup-
port from this year’s backcourt.

In an interview before the holi-
days, Coach Canfield seemed very
pleased with his defense, insisting
that it was already better than it was
at the end of last season. The ball-
players are scrapping more. When a
loose balls on the floor, they are
usually on it, Coach Canfield also
seemed pleased with the remarkable
experience of his squad. This could
be a crucial factor in some of the
closer games.

This weekend marks the first

Szlasa Named
Coach of Year

For Lacrosse

Washington and Lee lacrosse coach
Dick Szlasa Saturday was named the
1971 national “lacrosse coach of the
year” for the NCAA college division,

The award, voted by his fellow
coaches, was presented to Szlasa
during the concluding banquet of
the U.S. Intercollegiate Lacrosse As-
sociation (USILA) convention at At-
ltnic City, N.J.

Richie Moran, coach of Cornell's
national champion lacrosse team,
was named the top coach for the
university division,

Now in his fifth year at W&L,
Szlasa turned teams which had rec-
ord of 2-7 and 1-8 into teams which
posted records of 8-3 and 11-2. His
1971 team shared the South Atlantic
Division co-championship and was
voted the top college division team
in the country and ranked seventh
in the nation over-all,

With most of the 1971 team re-
turning, Szlasa’s 1972 Generals are
expected to contend for the national
championship.

The W&L schedule this year in-
cludes bouts with Navy, Johns Hop-
kins, and Virginia, among others.

New Course In

African

BY PAUL LANCASTER

A new course in politics will be
offered for the first time during the
spring term in 1972, in which stu-
dents from W&L will travel to East
Africa to view the political situation
in developing countries.

“The course, known as Politics
255, will be offered every two years,
if the necessary arrangements can
be made,” says Mr. James Loesel,
instructor of politics and the person
who will instruct this new course.

The course is similar in theory to
Politics 254, “Political Problems in
Underdeveloped Nations”, but, as
Loesel says, “It is an attempt to take
people out into the field to see what
it (the political situation) really looks
like. It's difficult to imagine how it
all fits together without seeing it.”

The course itself is worth six cred-
its, and Politics 101, “Comparative
Government”, is a prerequisite. Stu
dents enrolled in the course will
leave for East Africa April 10 and
will stay until around the end of
May

Loesel estimated that the costs ol
the course would estimate at $1200
$1500 for the entire term, with
about $850 of that needed for trans
portation, A maximum of 12 stu
dents will be taken into the course,
and seven students have already in

explain the substance of the course.

“We'll continue to Uganda to
Kampala, and stay for one week
paying particular attention to the
political problems of Uganda (which
is now under military rule). We'll
return to Nairobi then take a
field trip to Tanzania, particularly to
the capital of the East African Com
munity, Arusha. We'll be returning
to Nairobi via the coastal city of
Mombasa, to study the Arab influ
ence on East Africa.

“The course would conclude in
Nairobi, and the students would be
free about the time when exams fin
ish at WAL. I intend to stay in East
Africa, and I'll strongly encourage
the others to stay. I feel that they'll
have the savvy about travel, accom
modation, and sights to see after the
course, so that touring the area
would be far more profitable than it
would be without this preparation

Loesel emphasized that the course
is not only beneficial to politics
majors, but to other students as well
“The students will be free on week
ends to take advantage of one of the

“This will be an opportunity foi

Loesel contemplated the unique
ness of the course, “East Africa is a
most desired place for tourists, but
few have had the chance to actually
get inside the society. Most profes-
have the necessary con

and generally, students are limited
to an exchange program with the

EC Reminder

BY STEVE ROBINSON

President of the Student Body
On Saturday, for the third
time, Washington and Lee men
will begin independent exams,
There are a few things that
should be emphasized before the
exams begin.
1. Independent exams are a priv-
ilege, and one that benefits the
students greatly. We have this
benefit because of the Honor
System and the faith that is
placed in it by the faculty as well
as students.
2. Tests during independent ex-
ams will be given repeatedly
throughout the exam period, un-
like quizzes given during the reg-
ular semester, Hence, any com-
ments made during the exam
period may give information to
someone who has not taken the
test yet. Therefore, to insure the
integrity or each exam to every
student, students should refrain
from making comments about
tests until the exam period is over
at noon on Friday, December 17.

In light of these conditions, the
Executive Committee made the
following statement Monday
night:

The Executive Committee re
minds students that identical ex
aminations are given throughout
the examination period, and
therefore, the E.C., in the pos
sible strongest terms, discourages
vay comment about the examina
tions during the examination per
iod, Any comment, regardless of
iis nature, may be treated as a
possible honor violation,

Huntley Reveals
Student Selections

Upon the recommendations and
with the advice of the University
Council, the EC, and each of the
committees concerned, President of
the University R. E. R. Huntley
made the following student appoint-
ments to faculty standing commit-
tees. The announcement was releas-
ed by the president's office this week.

All of the following appointments
are made for the remaining portion
of this academic year:

(1) Admissions Committee, There
is currently one student serving on
this committee, James Gregory Wil-
son, ‘72, The student representation
is increased to two with the appoint-
ment of Griff Steel, °73. Both stu-
dents will have voting privileges on
all matters except those pertaining
to individual applications.

(2) Athletic Committee. The stu-
dent representation of two is in-
creased to three with the addition
of Johnny Lee White, °74.

(3) Curriculum Committee, David
Roger Munsick, Jr., °72 and Steven
Edward Lewis, °72, both current
members of the Student Curriculum

Committee, are appointed to serve
on the faculty body as well,

(4) Financial Aid Committee. Two
students are added to this committee
who shall have voting privileges on
all matters save those pertaining to
individual applications or determina-
tions, The men selected are James
Davis, °72 and William Bradley Hill,
i Th

(5) Library Committee, Currently,
the Chairman of the Student Library
Committee, Bill West, '72, serves as
a member of this committee. Two
other students have been added, Jim
Zeppieri, ‘73 and Carlyle Gregory,
‘74. Since the Student Library Com-
mittee has been disbanded, the three
remaining members, Bill Miller, °72,
Bill Woodward, ‘72, and John
Tucker, ‘72, have been asked by the
President to serve for the remainder
of the academic year as non-voting
advisory members.

(6) Student representation on the
Courses and Degrees Committee
and the Faculty Executive Commit-
tee remains unchanged. Each com-
mittee has one student member.

UC Explores Endowment,
Black Admissions, Tenure

With University President R. E. R.
Huntley and Student Body President
Steve Robinson presiding, the Uni-
versity Council held its December
meeting last Friday afternoon.
Topics discussed by the joint student-
faculty body included financial aid
funds for black students, the overall
state of the endowment, and the
procedure for granting faculty ten-
ure.

In response to student question-
ing, members of the administration
outlined the current state of efforts
to recruit black students for W&L.
It was pointed out that though the
amount of financial aid available for
this purpose was smaller this year
than in previous years, this was to
be expected since grants to black
students already enrolled have had
to be continued. There were sixteen
black students admitted the first year
of the program, about half of the ap-
plicants accepted by the university.

“We accepted the same number
this year,” remarked Dean William
McC. Schildt, associate Director of
Admissions, “But we lost out in the
competition with other schools, more
so than the previous year.”

Senior Bob Carrere asked whether
the university had considered taking
some students “with less than a col-
lege preparatory background and
then supplementing his learning with
some remedial work through a Black
Union or whatever =

Schildt said that in order to be
fair with such students, the univer
sity would have to be prepared to
make up any deficiency. He added
that the “Upward Bound” remedial
program had been explored by

Lexington just

held its

WAL two ago, but it was
found that federal aid is
forthcoming only for larger univer
sities,

In the review of black applicants,
Schildt said, grades and class rank
are considered “the better predic-
tors” as opposed to College Board
scores. There have been no excep
tions made concerning the minimum
standards of secondary school credits
and distribution—‘“the Admissions
Committee feels confident that it
can get a sufficient number of stu-
dents who meet these requirements,”
Schildt stated.

In the segment of the
meeting, University treasurer James
Whitehead summarized the current
state of the endowment. As it stands,
the endowment totals between $20 to
$22 million. Steve Robinson
tioned the interest from this total,
which last year yielded some $355,
000. Mr. Whitehead replied that this
figure was misleading, because it did
not take into account the total divi-
dends and appreciation from the en
dowment,

Whitehead explained that opera
tional University services
were going up, and that price rises
have been planned for January in
the Cockpit. The tavern registered a
$4000 last year, which was
not offset by small profits in the
Supply Store and the Bookstore

| OUTLOOK and REVIEW |

Not many colleges or universities can claim’an on-campus,
school owned and sanctioned tavern. Washington and Lee
University is one of the few. We have the “Cockpit” located
in the University Center.

The new Early-Fielding Memorial Building has been a
great asset to the University, The structure houses television
rooms, meeting rooms, offices for student organizations, and
a gameroom. At long last the independents, as well as frater-
nity men, have a place to congregate, socialize and just get
drunk if the need be.

Despite these advantages the University Center has had
some significant problems. First, townspeople regularly would
take over the Cockpit and not exactly conduct themselves like
ladies and gentlemen. Mixers were especially trying events for
members of the University Center Committee who oversee the
building’s functions. With regularity visitors would start
swinging and it was the Cockpit which received the real dam-
age. Aside from the fact the tavern was built with W&L stu-
dent customers in mind, the Cockpit is a public business. Only
with great difficulty and some recent luck has this problem
diminished.

The most obvious problem today is that the Cockpit is not
recording a profit. Over the last two years the tavern and
gameroom have not been self-supporting. Mr. Marshall Sum-
ner, manager of the Cockpit, admits the excess of expenses
over income. He claims that there is little that can be done
under the existing situation, “This whole problem is just
coming to light,” he added.

According to Sumner there was an oversight in the plan-
ning of the Cockpit. Originally, a food service was not antici-
pated by the building’s designers. The planners as far as
Sumner can surmise, wanted a rathskeller set-up, which would
serve only beer. The Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control
Board did not think that was such a super idea. It seems that
state statutes will not allow the exclusive sale of beer. “The
ABC said we must sell food, if we sell beer; and at least 50
per cent of our sales must be food,” Sumner added. He also
pointed out that ABC men check his receipts monthly just to
make sure,

In the Cockpit’s construction only a bar and a storage
room were provided for. Sumner had to convert the small
storage room into a cramped, hot kitchen. Sumner observed

that, “I’m operating out of a storage room. It was a last min-
ute decision to throw in a grill and a deep-fryer.”

I-xpansion of the kitchen or would-be storage room seems
necessary if the Cockpit can operate within the law and make
a profit. Mr, Sumner admits that “the bar is not very efficient.
It is a beautiful New York style bar but it should be out
among the booths, where it could be serving more folks.”
Such an expensive expansion seems tragic only two years
after the building’s completion, but the mistake was made. It
should be corrected. With the Cockpit losing money, it is ap-
parent that the enterprise cannot raise the funds on its own.
Only the University is capable of underwriting such an un-
dertaking.

Some people might say this expansion is unneeded. They
would encourage the Cockpit to try harder to make a profit.
But, currently the tavern serves about 250 people daily. Sum-
ner wishes that he could serve “lots more”, but the grill is “at
its maximum in food production.” During an average month
the Cockpit has about $8000 in sales. In recent months sales
have risen,

Although sales have gone up, the profit margin has not,
Sumner summarized the reasons for this phenomenon. “The
wage-price freeze hit us hard this summer. There have been
no price increases since last January.” Sumner plans a price
increase next month at the beginning of the Winter Term.
According to the government's guidelines, there will probably
be a two-and-a-half per cent hike.

Also the Cockpit employs mostly student waiters, Often
student workers are not the most efficient from a business per-
spective. When exams and test periods come, it is often hard
to get enough student workers, But Sumner emphasized that
“the school would like for me to use students.”

Still another cause for the absence of profits in the Cock-
pit is the exclusive sale of 3.2 beer, Many bars in Lexington
sell 6.4 beer. Why should anybody drink 3.2 beer when he can
drink 6.4 in plenty of other spots? Because the school is ad-
hering to the law, i.e. selling 3.2 beer to the under twenty-one
year-olds, it is probably losing some possible business,

With these facts in mind, it seems that the Cockpit is not
operating without some restraints, The bar should be expand.
ed, at the very least, so that the tavern can serve its customers
a bit better. Having this tavern can be quite a boon to the

University, As has already been said, few colleges have as nice
a place to go, so close to campus. Yet, unless the tavern can
pay its own way, it is quite a burden,

Like numerous characteristics of
Washington and Lee, tenure is a
tradition. Yet, unlike many of the
University’s other traditions, tenure
does not belong to Washington and
Lee exclusively. Tenure is an ac-
cepted feature at just about every
institution of higher education in the
United States. Widespread accept-
ance does not, however, assure un-
contested existence for the tenure
system at American universities.

As it has done numerous times in
the past, the academic community is
currently re-debating the system and
its implications, That the tenure sys-
tem survives and has survived for so
long is in itself, some advocates be-
lieve, comment on tenure’s value,
Tenure is not free from critics nor
free from questioning however.
Much of the debate can be decided,
first of all, by an explanation of ten-
ure and its intended purpose.

The purpose of tenure is to assure
academic freedom for professional
teachers and scholars by providing
a certain degree of job security fol-
lowing a period of probationary em-
ployment. A tenured faculty member
is not exempt from dismissal, but
can only be dismissed for “adequate
cause” and by due academic pro-
cess, with an emphasis on self-peer
group evaluation,

Academic freedom is appraised to
be that atmosphere in which acade-
micians openly discuss new ideas
and theories, however unconven-
tional; indulge in extensive research
and investigations; and publish re-
sults of such activities, if they so de-
sire, free from institutional censor-
ship and fear of unemployment.

Proponents of tenure stress that
the ultimate end of tenure is pre-
servation of this academic freedom
and that the resulting degree of pro-
fessional ‘security is merely a means,
and in their opinion, the best means,
of attaining this end. As taken from
Washington and Lee's faculty and
Board of Trustees approved state-
ment on “Faculty Appointments,
Tenure, and Academic Freedom”,
“the functional purpose of the prin-
ciple of academic tenure is to create
an atmosphere of mutual good faith
and dedication in achieving a stimu-
latifg intellectual exchange between
members of the University commun-
ity.”

The greatest debates are not con-
cerned so much with whether or not
academic freedom should be main-
tained, Such freedom is, with its en-
couragement of professionalism and
learning, considered a vital element
of society's process of self-improve-
ment. Rather, the debates center
around: determining exactly what
“adequate cause” for dismissal en-
tails; those standards institutions set
and require their candidates to meet
in order for them to gain tenure; the
problem of tenured faculty members
who discredit the confidence and
dodge some of the responsibilities
invested in them after their having
attained the degree of job security;
and finally, since it has such debat-
able points about it, whether or not
there is a better system by which

It is highly indicative of the cur-
rent state of world affairs that In-
dia—a nation that has for the past
Six years repeatedly condemned the
United States with “imperialism and
colonialism” in Vietnam—is itself
currently engaging in both these ac-
tivities in its relations with Pakistan.
In spite of its feverish denunciations
of the American position on South-
east Asia, India has now seen fit to
attempt to imperialize and colon-
ialize East Pakistan by turning it
into the satellite state of “Bangla
Desh.”

Over the past twenty-four years
India has found itself in constant
and bitter conflict with Pakistan; al-
though an uneasy truce has been in
effect for most of that time, still a
potential state of war has existed
and has broken into armed conflict
on three occasions, The first two
conflicts, however, did not involve
East Pakistan, where there was in
both campaigns but limited action.
Now that India has seen an oppor-
tunity to utilize the ancient axiom of
“Divida et Impera,” she has moved
aggressively and dynamically to sep-
erate the two halves of her enemy
and thus to weaken the western state
while making the eastern part into a
subservient colony similar to Nepal
or Sikkim.

India’s move at this time was a

India and Bangla Desh

academic freedom can be assured,
Tenure at Washington and Lee
parallels the 1940 “Statement of
Principles On Academic Freedom
and Tenure” as it was formally
drawn up by the American Associa-
tion of University Professors in con-
junction with the Association of
American Colleges, This statement is
the principal foundation for the
tenure system in the United States.
At Washington and Lee, awarding
of tenure to a faculty member is
preceded by a determined number of
term appointments, that is, a pro-
bationary period during which the
faculty member's performance is ob-
served and evaluated. For Instruc-
tors and Assistant Professors, the
total period of service on term ap-
pointments cannot exceed seven
years, For Associate Professors and
Professors, the maximum period of
service is two years. Any appoint-
ment which extends beyond these
service periods is considered a ten-
ure appointment. A faculty member
whose term renewal and, therefore,
tenure has been decided against is
given notice far in advance of the
date of his dismissal. Tenure may
also be granted before expiration of
a term appointment or even upon
initial appointment to the University.
A hierarchy of committees and
administrators is involved in the
tenure granting procedure at Wash-
ington and Lee. The Board of
Trustees is the final authority in the
matter. The Board receives its rec-
ommendations from President Hunt-
ley who, in return, relies upon the
advice of the Advisory Committee
which is comprised of the three
Deans: William J. Watt (of the Col-
lege), Roy Lee Steinheimer (of the
Law School), and Edward C, At-
wood (of the School of Commerce,
Economics, and Politics) and also
three faculty members elected by the
faculty. From here, the procedure
depends upon the various depart-
ment heads and their experiences
with their faculty members. The
recommendations are based upon in-
formal observations and the relation-
ships created within the University
community rather than upon any
systematic process. Some depart-
ments employ team teaching and, as
a consequence, quality of teacher
performance becomes known.

As Dean of the College, William
J, Watt is concerned with tenure and
its application and meaning here at
Washington and Lee. Regarding this
topic of the formation of recom-
mendations, Dean Watt notes, “We
also hear from students, student
feedback you might call it. There are
many things involved that you can’t
help but observe, things that every-
one on campus discovers, There is a
great advantage in being small, too”,
he points out, “as relationships be-
tween faculty and administrators are
easily had. Everyone knows each
other.” In a community as small as
Washington and Lee's, word gets
around,

In evaluating a candidate for ten-
ure, the University uses basically the
same criteria as it does for granting
salary increases, reappointments, and

careful and well planned action de-
signed to take into account the cur-
rent tension within the two halves
of Pakistan. India did not fare as
well as she had hoped in the last
war: with a large portion of her
military force restricted to guarding
the critical Chinese border, she was
unable in a western war to obtain a
direct victory, With the possibility
of fighting a weak and divided Pak-
istan, though, India has provoked a
conflict in which her opponent is
forced to split her forces between
fighting a civil war and repelling the
invader. While the military situation
is still not clear, and while prelimi-
nary indications are that Pakistan is
holding her own, still the situation is
now far more favorable to India
than it was in the 1965 war.

The conflict is not a clearly re
wived issue for the United States
although India has allied herself re-
cently to the Soviet Union, Pakis
tan has made self-defense pacts of
a similar nature with Red China
Whichever way we turn might well
reinforce either a Soviet or Chinese
presence in the Indian Ocean basin
and further weaken western power
im this crucial region, There is no
absolute right or wrong in this crisis,
and no clear-cut path for this nation
we can only work to bring both sides
to the truce table and attempt to
end this open aggression by India

readily measured signs of the candi-
date’s merit are: degrees earned, any
publications, professional papers,
summer study or teaching, and simi-
lar signs of scholarly activity.

After tenure has been granted,
new implications arise. The most
significant is in deciding just what
constitutes “adequate cause” for dis-
missal. The University policy states
that, “a faculty member shall have
permanent and continuous tenure,
which is defined as meaning that his
services shall not be terminated or
his academic rank reduced except
for adequate cause, or because of
attainment of the established retire-
ment age, or under extraordinary
circumstances because of financial
exigencies,”

The problem of determining “ade-
quate cause” has not arisen too fre-
quently here at Washington and
Lee. “My general impression is that
most people work out,” says Dean
Watt. As possible examples of “ade-
quate cause” for dismissal, he cites
instances of “noticeably ineffective
teaching, inclusion of irrelative mat-
ter in classroom discussion, or per-
haps some flagrant moral violation,”
The Dean stresses the “each case
has to be judged on its own merits
and such cases are not very common
at the University.” A financial exig-
ency might be the elimination of a
department, thereby causing unem-
ployment. University policy also
states that a tenure appointment ex-
pires the June following the teach-
er’s 65th birthday. In such cases, the
teacher may be reappointed for one
year terms up to his 70th birthday.

It is clear, then, that tenure does
not provide life-long employment
security. Tenured people face many
uncertainties even though they are
few compared to the non-tenured
person. The most significant differ-
ence between the tenured and non-
tenured teacher has to do with the

BY JOHNNY MORRISON

My first article seems to have
caused many students to see the rele-
vance of community control. I have
been approached by both those who
agree with me and also those who do
not agree with me. My fellow stu-
dents who find it quite arduous to
understand why we Blacks advocate
community control may agree with
us after reading this article.

Recently, demands by groups that
have traditionally had litthe power—
mostly Blacks and affluent White
students—for larger and enhanced
roles in the making of policies that
affect their lives have been both
hailed and condemned. | think that
those who condemn these demands
are what we call “advocates of the
status quo.” These are the people
who are characterized as being very
conservative and traditional, When
| say conservative, | am talking
about the American concept of con-
servatism and not the British con-
cept, Any student of political sei-
ence or of any knowledge of the
political make-up of the British gov-
ernment knows that many programs
which were carried out by the Con-
servative Party would be considered
a drastic and radical change by the
Americans who incidentally happen
to be conservative,

The hope of Blacks to become the
inttiator of inputs which may be
helpful or detrimental to their life
has brought into being a key issue of
the political agenda for the last
twelve years, It was reported during
the 1968 Presidential campaign that,
“Mr, Humphrey's private polls have
shown that what voters of all per
suasions Want most is a sense of
participation in the political process,
a feeling that they can be heard and
have their doubts addressed.”

Any student who has had a course
in American History knows that feel
ings such as the above are not new
among Americans, The early colo-
nists main argument with the
mother country (Great Britain) was
that they were being treated as see

ond-class cilizvens and being sub
jected to “taxation without repre
sentation,”

Most of the times when Black

spokesmen demand more and great

economies apparatus of their respec

burden of proof, In the case of the
tenured teacher, the burden is on the
University to provide proof for dis-
missal, In the case of the non-tenur-
ed teacher, the University is not un-
der any such obligation,

How does Washington and Lee
deal with the tenured professional
scholar or teacher who apparently
takes advantage of his position and
fails to perform up to the expected
standards? Channels are available
for anyone with a complaint against
a certain teacher. For instance, any
student with a complaint is urged to
take the matter up with the teacher
himself, or with the department
head, or a Dean, or even all the way
to the Board of Trustees until he
gains satisfaction. Dean Watt con-
tends that “they should feel free to
come to any of us,”

Many in the academic community
see holes in the structure of tenure,
the largest being this possible pro-
tection of professors who “take ad-
vantage.” One suggested remedy in
this area is proposed by a Mr. Henry
Saltzman, president of Pratt Instit-
ute, in the November 8, 1971 issue
of The Chronicle of Higher Educa-
tion. Mr. Saltzman calls for the for-
mation of a National Tenured Pro-
fessor Accreditation Board which
would evaluate the performance of
each tenured faculty member ac-
cording to “objective, balanced, rea-
sonable standards and criteria.” Mr.
Saltzman urges the academic com-
munity to adopt such a self-policing
system “before other groups within
society (e.g, students, parents, legis-
lators, taxpayers, and university ad-
minisirators) move to impose stand-
ards that may be harmful to the
community of scholars.” Dean Watt
feels “this is something that needs to
be studied just as the University will
continue to study all of its policies.”

Although there is this hole to fill
in the tenure system, the academic
community seems at a loss to devise
any new system which would, most
importantly, preserve academic free-
dom and also command professional-
ism at all times. The community
would rather attempt to fill the holes
in tenure than to scrap the entire
policy in favor of another less effec-
tive one or in favor of none at all.

tive locales, their usual list of re-
forms includes the following: A) de-
volution of as much authority as pos-
sible to neighborhood communities;
B) more representation of the com-
munity on the city council, the board
of education and other policy mak-
ing bodies; C) strong and vigorous
application of public resources to
facilitate the development of Black
controlled businesses; D) more Black
representatives on all levels of public
service——not just token numbers
either; and E) Black representation
in union and labor forces and gov-
ernment contractors,

There are many facets to the
meaning of community control, One
is restructuring and reorienting the
government, What we Blacks across
the country want are federal, state,
and local administrations and policy
makers which will give top priority
to the attainment of racial equality.
We want the type of government
which is inclined and committed to
making policies “with” rather than
“for” the people of their community
—whether they be Black, White,
Jewish, Chicano, etc. What we
(Blacks) want are administrations
which will train us in all areas of the
political and economic make-up of a
community,

In essence, We want to stop being
colonies and want our independence
from the ruling outsiders. To para-
phrase the words of Frantz Fanon,
we will not be moliified by the pro
visions for a few of our number,
who, by adopting the so-called right
speech and cultural and behavior
patterns, do not become an insiru
ment for us (Blacks) but only an in
sirument of the institutions.

My claim that in most revolutions
impatience is usually caused by a
little progress can be made valid if
one only examines the different ap
proaches and techniques used by
Hlacks in the fifties, sixties and now
As one can notice. if he has any
sense of comprehension, the more
progress made the more impatient
we become. This mood is not only a
unique characteristic of the Black
Power movement in America but
can be traced back to past revolu

Cavaliers Whip W@L 113-80

Generals Even Record At 2-2

BY PALMER TRICE

The W&L_ basketball Generals
opened their new Doremus Gym-
nasium last Wednesday with a cele-
bration unmatched in Washington
and Lee history. The fanfare was
overwhelming, as the Generals
sought to open their latest season on
a winning note. But, alas, neither
President Huntley’s opening re-
marks, nor the presence of “Cap'n
Dick” and Cy Young could save the
B-ballers.

W&L set out to accomplish sev-
eral things, few of which succeeded.

‘The Blue were unable to run success-

fully on the quick Cavaliers, The
cross-mountain rivals enjoyed a vast
height advantage, which the home
team was unable to neutralize. They
also were much cooler in their first
test under fire. Even though the
Wahoos did not quite live up to their
advance billing, they overwhelmed
the Generals.

Except for Skip Lichtfuss’ open-
ing drive, and McClure’s tap in at
the 7:13 spot, the Blue stayed in
arrears of the Cavaliers, The Wa-
hoos dominated the game, with Scott
McCandlish racking up both re-
bounds and points. Over a third of
their points were garnered under the
boards,

The final score reflected how
close the Generals actually were in
contention. The 113-80 score was
determined in a large part by the
excellent play of the Virginia subs,
Bob Mckeag, Bob McCurdy, Chip
Miller, and Al Drummond never
eased up on the Generals,

The Wahoos consistently broke
the Generals 1-3-1 press, which re-
sulted in many easy baskets. This de-
stroyed Coach Canfield’s attempts to
use John Dumas, and forced him to
concede size, in hopes of making up
for it with quickness. This didn’t
work,

However, as Coach Canfield said
after the game, don't judge the
players on this performance. The
Blue admittedly looked sloppy, but
they were contending with ACC
competitor Virginia, who just recent-
ly upset always tough Duke, at the
Blue Devils home court.

What turned out to be the third
Washington and Lee Invitational
fournament was played here on Fri-
day and Saturday nights. The open-
ing rounds saw two rather boring
games. In the first one, Drexel de-
feated West Virginia Tech by a score
of 74-63. Both teams played sloppy
ball, with the exception of Drexel’s
sophomore guard, Dave Williams.
Williams got the big baskets for his

Philly team when they needed them.
Steve Lilly also aided his team’s
cause by grabbing 20 rebounds, and
adding 13 points to Williams’ 20.
Lilly had plenty of help under the
boards, as Drexel’s rebounding took
its toll,

Friday night's second game match-
ed up Lycoming College with our
Generals. The first half proved to be
a real see-saw battle, with the home
team finally grabbing a 51-49 lead
at its end. W&L was hurt by sloppy
passing, poor defense, a hot shooting
Lycoming ball club, and an inability
to hit the outside shot, The second
half told a different story, as the
Generals stormed into the lead,
aided by sloppy Lycoming ball han-
dling, and by a Lycoming cold spell.
The Blue ran and ran and ran. For
a change, the ball went through the
hoop. W&L made their own breaks
and capitalized on them, A Gutshall
lay-up launched the Generals over
the hundred mark for the first time
this year. The final score of 107-83
showed two things: the Blue are
going to be more exciting than last
year’s deliberate ball club, and they
also play less defense.

The Generals scoring was well-
balanced. Mike Daniel had 28, John
Glace, 20, Paul McClure, 19, and
Skip Lichtfuss, 18,

Saturday night’s Consolation game
match West Va. Tech against Ly-
coming. W.Va. won this one in over-
time, 74-71, Both teams improved
their performances over those in
Friday’s games,

The championship was Washing-
ton and Lee's first real contest. The
game against U.Va. was a runaway,
and the Lycoming game had turned
into one in the second half, Drexel
was coming off a 7-17 season last
year, but they had won their open-
ing contest, They had two quick
guards in Mike Fee and Dave Wil-
liams, Steve Lilly had proved his
ability as a “big man” (6°3) in the
opening game. Drexel wasn't too big,
but they were quick.

Even with all this in mind, one
had to go with the Generals, They
had all their starters returning from
last year, they were playing at home,
and they had won convincingly the
night before. But from the beginning
things went array. Drexel hit 10 of
their first 12 shots from the field.
Mike Fee and his teammates broke
the Generals 1-3-1 press with ease.
They played good defense, but most
of all they just didn’t miss.

Drexel crashed the boards, giving
WA&L only one shot at the basket.
Panl McClure, meanwhile was hit-
ing 9 of Il from the field, but these

were from outside, and Paul had
little success on the boards, With the
shooting of McClure, and a brief
cold spell by Drexel, the Generals
got back into the ball game by half-
time, 40-36.

Early in the second half, the Blue
press began to work and Drexel con-
tinued its shooting failures, With
11:08 left in the game, the Generals
grabbed a 52-51 lead. But this did
not last long. The Blue were unable
to penetrate the Drexel 1-2-2 zone,
and fell behind once again. This
time, Drexel put it away. They pull-
ed away steadily, with their bench
aiding in the final 86-72 margin,

After the game, President Hunt-
ley awarded the team trophies, and
announced the — All-Tournament
team. It included W.Va,’s John
Gourley, Lycoming’s Rich Hennin-
ger, who averaged 29 points a game,
W&L's Mike Daniel, and the co-
MVP's Mike Fee and Steve Lilly.

In their first venture away from
the not so friendly confines of New
Doremus, the Blue travelled to
Lynchburg Monday night, to take
on the Lynchburg Hornets, This was
a game with some vengeful over-
tones. The Hornets had upset the
Generals last year in a hotly con-
tested battle in Lynchburg. They

Daniel’s 28 points and Charlie
Strain’s 9 assists, the B-ballers walk-
ed off with an 85-75 victory. Coach
Canfield juggled his starting line-up
in an attempt to get more punch out
front. His strategy worked, as he got
a fine performance from the Garden
City, N.Y. junior,

Canfield said it was the best team
effort of the year. “The kids deserv-
ed to win the way they played.” He
was encouraged by the team’s im-
proved rebounding. The Generals
kept the Hornets away from the
boards, and hope to do the same
tonight against the Tigers,

Strain and John Dumas started for
the first time Monday night, “It en-
abled us to start a big lineup”, said
Canfield, with Dumas at 6-4 and
Strain the biggest guard at 6-1, Du-
mas helped out under the boards
and on defense, Strain had five
steals.

Hopefully, the Generals are over
the hump. They entertain a young
Hampden-Sydney ball club on Wed-
nesday night. The Tigers, longtime
rivals of Washington and Lee, lost
their front line from last year’s club,
They also have a new coach at the
helm. Tonight's game will be the last

THE RING-TUM PHI

University Council Views Tenure

(Continued trom page 1)
that any student belief that the text-
book division of the Supply Store
makes inordinate profit was fallaci-
ous.

The final question discussed was
the matter of faculty tenure. Presi-
dent Huntley explained to the Com-
mittee the procedure for granting
tenure, and that every faculty mem-
ber comes under consideration after
a specified number of years. A fac-
ulty member is either given tenure
at that time or he is dismissed.

Professor Mike Pinney suggested
that many students were under the
misapprehension that, once given
tenure, a faculty member cannot be
removed. If there is reasonable
cause, he said, a professor may be
dismissed after a hearing and the
consent of the Board of Trustees.

Salaries and promotions are con-
sidered separately, and neither are
not necessarily dependent on the
length of a professor's career here.
Steve Robinson stated that some stu-
dents feel that certain teachers had

slacked off in their efforts after re-
ceiving the assurances of tenure.
“There is a possibility that a profes-
sor could be goofing off,” comment-
ed Dr. David Elmes, “or perhaps the
professor just doesn’t know he is
being ineffective.”

Several faculty members suggest-
ed that any student who feels his
professor has room for considerable
improvement should let him know
directly. “I wonder how concerned
students are,” Dr. Robert Huntley
remarked, “considering the response
last year to the Curriculum Commit-
tee’s teacher evaluation poll.”

Professor Pinney said that he had
real misgivings about the validity of
any formal poll on teacher evalua-
tion, and he encouraged students to
take their criticisms to the professor
concerned, “Students are always
ready to lampoon a professor they
felt treated them unfairly,” he said.
“I personally have always been hesi-
tant of the over-formalization of the
evaluation technique.”

For Community Control

(Continued from page 2)
clear for one to accept the use of the
colonial analogy now that its valid-
ity is highly questionable. When the
inferiority of Blacks was enforced by
law and custom and when most
Blacks were denied a right to vote,
the validity of the colonial analogy
was indisputable. Now that formal

discrimination has been outlawed
and some institutions are giving
“some” Blacks preferential — treat-

ment, it may seem hyperbolic to one,

To those who still find it ardous to
accept the validity of the colonial
analogy, | can only say to you that
although things have changed some,
we (Blacks) still remain a small and
impoverished minority, We are still
subject to a large degree, in the pub-
lic and private sectors, to institutions
in which our representation at the
top is very minimum and negligible.
Since the white majority as a whole
is unsolicitous of our interests, goals
and aspirations, it is valid to speak
of a white majority tyranny. If we
take recent world history into consid-
eration, the use of the term “colo-
nialism” by Blacks is understand-
able, and felicitous politically if not
analytically.

There is one thing agreed upon by
both Blacks who are committed to
total integration and those bent on
separatism. This one thing is the
colonial analogy. The language of
Black people plays an important
factor with this point also. Most
Black intellectuals and activists have
already agreed that the language of
Blacks and Black politics is used to
explain why Black political and eco-
nomic power is vital and essential
to the molding of self-respect in
Black communities, why the mobili-
zation of the Black masses is a pre-
requisite to equality, and why equal-
ily is a prerequisite to integration.

Blacks’ demands for more com
munity control can be compared to
the societies of the past and the pres-

ereo

 

order, at a tremendous discount.

Fisher selected this student because |):
is uniquely qualified to act as your Fisher
representative. He knows a lot about high fidelity
He's a reliable person. And since he’s a student
himself, he knows what students need in the

vay of stereo equipment.

And since he's the Fisher representative,
\e's got what you need. Because Fisher

makes practically everything.

We invented high fidelity

ent cry for a complete system built
on the theory of participatory de-
mocracy. Many whites today agree
that administrative decentralization
is needed in the nation’s large cities.
Most of them also believe that a
good administration is one which is
sensitive and responsive to its cli-
ents’ desires,

Along this line of reasoning, one
will also find that what most whites
usually have in mind is the delega-
tion of authority from bureaucracies
to field officers (e.g. school board
members and principals) who will
probably seek good community rela-
tions—but, if by chance they “go
native”, they can be brought down
by demotion by their superiors.

Sometimes, one may oppose com-
munity control because of  self-in
terest. Political theorists of the past
said that most people who are hold-
ers of the political and economic
power will be very reluctant to give
it up. Today, one will find that civil
servants Oppose community control
for fear of their profits, etc.

Aside from self-interest, most
whites just simply disbelieve that
Blacks have a legitimate complaint
about the operation of city govern-
ment. They think that we (Blacks)
only have ourselves to blame for our
impoverished condition.

Ihe Kerner Commission in 1968
conducted a survey in fifteen large
cities and asked these questions. “On
the average, Negroes in your urban
area have worse jobs, education, and
housing than white people. Do you
think that this is due mainly to
Negroes having been discriminated
against, or mainly due to something
about Negroes themselves?” This is
how the white respondents answered:

Mainly due to discrimination 19%
Mainly due to Blacks them-
selves 56%

A mixture of both 19%
Don't know 6%

It is shown here that there seems
whites with respect to the causes of
white’s with respect to the causes of
the impoverished conditions of
Blacks. The system—from the cultu-
ral and behavioral patterns to the
political, educational and economic
—is the cause of our impoverished
conditions, Some may think that I
am being “too” blatant in putting
the blame on the institutions and the
system. If we (Black and white alike)
want to make this a real “land of
liberty for all” and a “land of the
free” then let us start accepting the
real causes—no matter how much it
hurts—and work to alleviate them.

For those who believe that social
discrimination is real but are “dis-
inclined to favor community control
because they think that community
control would be a step toward
racial separatism and would only in-
tensify rather than alleviate social
friction, | will write next week’s ar-

Law School Officers Elected

EC Grants Appropriation To SBA

BY DICK AMRHINE
Facing a considerable amount of

new semester business, the Execu-
tive Committee convened this week
and decided unanimously to give

the Student Bar Association of the
Law School $437.50 ($1.75 per stu-
dent) to facilitate various Law
School needs.

Charlie Hofheimer, fall president
of the SBA spearheaded the discus-
sion as to whether or not these
funds would have to be shared with
the Law Review. The EC deter-
mined that a separate amount would
be alloted to the periodical. The re-
quest will be formally presented by
Lock Handley, Law School repre-
sentative on the EC, at a later date.

Also the EC announced the re-
sulis of the Law School Elections

held a week before the holidays.
Running for president of the win-
ter term were Tom Gosse, Pete
Wimbrow and Lawson Turner, with
lurner emerging victorious in a run-
off. The office of vice-president was
contested by Mac Squires and Jim
Stalnaker, with Squires winning.
Larry Croft ran unopposed for sec-
retary as did Ridge Porter for treas-
urer.

In other business Monday night,
the EC heard several committee re-
ports. Curriculum Committee
Chairman Roger Munsick present-
ed a number of ideas being studied
by his committee.

In exploring possibilities of
courses concerning other cultures,
the commitee conducted a poll the
results of which favored such

by Sophomore EC Representative

that the committee welcomes sug-

Former Secretary of the Interior
Stewart Udall and Tennessee Sena-
tor William E. Brock are among
the distinguished figures who will
participate in this year’s ‘Contact’
Symposium, to be held during the
first two weeks in February.

According to Roger Munsick and
Skip Paukert, co-chairmen of the
‘Contact’ Steering Committee, the
names of the other lecturers ap-
pearing throughout the program
will be revealed during the next
few weeks. “We are making a bold
departure from the essentially sin-

gle-theme programs of the past,”
said Paukert. “We feel that this
freedom has allowed us to create

a program of wide-ranging appeal.”

Mr. Udall will inaugurate the
‘Contact’ forum on Tuesday, Febru-
ary |, with an 8 p.m. talk in Lee
Chapel. His topic is expected to con-
cern environmental issues. An in-
formal seminar will be held with
Mr. Udail in the Student Center Li-
brary that afternoon.

Senator Brock will appear on
Thursday, February 3, with an ad-
dress at 3:30 p.m. in the Lee Cha-
pel. Following the Senator's speech,
there will be a reception for him
sponsored by the University Repub-
licans, also in the Student Center,
to which the public will be invited.

Senator Brock, whose narrow vic-
tory over incumbent Albert Gore
in 1970 heartened the Nixon Ad-
ministration, is a 1953 graduate of
the W&i. Commerce School. The
4i-year old Chattanooga native had
served in the United States Congress
for eight years before winning the
Senate seat.

Though the Republican Brock
generally voted along party
lines during his legislative career,
many liberals have applauded his
civic activities in his home city.

In one such effort Brock spear-
headed a literacy drive in Chat-
tanooga and personally taught
reading and writing to impoverish-

! blacks in the area.

Brock’s election battle was a fo-
cus of national attention two years

Administration target. Brock emer
eed victorious by about 42.000
votes. He serves on the Committee

for Banking. Housing and Urban
\llairs as well as on the Govern-
ment Operations Committee.
Stewart Udall served for eight
years as Secretary of the Interior in

the Kennedy and Johnson admini-
strations. He has since served as
Visiting Professor of Environmen-
tal Humanism at Yale and as Chair-
man of ‘Overview,’ an environmen-
tal consulting group for govern-
ments and industry.

Udall is a graduate of the Uni-
versity of Arizona. He practiced law
in his home state before serving
three terms in the U.S. House of
Representatives. He was appointed
to the Interior post in 1961.

As secretary, Udall was among
the early proponents of ‘the new
Conservation,” a long-range plan of
environmental protection. He also
participated in talks with former
USSR Chairman Khruschev in 1962
while on a tour of Russian hydro-
power facilities.

He is the author of two books,
“1976—Agenda for Tomorrow”
and “The Quiet Crisis.” Udall has
recently been prominent for his
vocal support of his son, who is a
draft evader exiled in Canada.

Letter Donated
To Archives

The Lee Archives contain the
most complete collection of ma-
terials and manuscripts relating to
the Lee family. Dr. Allen Moger,
Professor of History and head of
the archives notes that “dozens of
letters have been added to the Lee
Archives through the generosity of
people who prize them, but wanted
them to be in a safe place for the
sake of posterity.”

Dr. Moger also stressed the im-
portance of the way in which let-
ters are catalogued. Letters written
by Lee are catalogued under the
recipient's name, while those ad-
dressed to the Civil War leader are

grouped under the name of the
writer.

Three of the Lee family manu-
scripts have been presented to

Washington and Lee by Mrs. Stan-
ley Brown of Leesburg. Mrs. Brown
also donated a two page handwrit-
ten letter by Mary Custis Lee, writ-
ten in September, 1872, and a pass
signed by Lee when he was a cadet
adjutant at the United States Mili-
tary Academy in 1829.

Washington and Lee's policy is to offer financial assistance
to any admitted student who without assistance would be
unable to attend the University. No student who believes he is
qualified for admission should fail to apply because he lacks
financial resources.

The aid rendered by Washington and Lee may be a schol-
arship or a grant, a long-term educational loan, a part-time
job on campus, or a combination of any of these. Annually,
the University provides approximately $500,000 to more than
300 students and is seeking constantly to broaden its financial
aid programs.

—from the Washington and Lee University Bulletin

 

Recently the Student Recruitment Committee obtained a
grant of $20,000. The sum will be allocated to four students as
scholarships.

Over the brief period of two years the committee has done
quite a job, Several thousand dollars have been raised and
earmarked for minority group students. Also the group has
encouraged several youths to seek an education at W&L,
youths who might never have considered enrolling in our in-
Overall the Student Committee's
deeds have been quite successful and worthy of congratula-

stitution, Recruitment
tions. These students have scrambled for minority group stu-
dents and money to get these students through W&L.

Unfortunately, this scrambling, especially for money, has
hecome a necessity. The Comprehensive Tuition Fee is $2,200
a year. Next year the same fee is expected to rise even higher
to $2,300. With tuition increasing, and a basic scholarship
fund of half a million dollars, fewer men will get scholarships
or people currently on scholarship can anticipate a propor-
tionally devalued sum next year.

There is an alternative to this scholarship squeeze. Yale
University has developed a unique solution to this educa-
tional expense problem. Yale President, Kingman Brewster
Jr. hypothesized that, “Unless we use some ingenuity we must

either lower our quality or close our doors to those who

cannot pay the increased cost of quality.”

The Yale plan is basically GO TO SCHOOL NOW—
PAY LATER. The “Tuition Postponement Option” has been
labeled by the media as Pay as You Earn (PAY: incident-
ally is the accepted abbreviation).

The mechanics of the system are quite simple. .\ student
asks for a loan. The sum is repaid over a 35 year period, Un-
der the present setup, the repayment period is between five
and ten years at most colleges and universities. The alumnus,
however, does not pay back the amount borrowed. Instead, the
former student pays a fixed percentage of his yearly income.
The suggested rate for Yale was 4 per cent for every $1,000
borrowed. Here is an example of how it would work: a stu-
dent borrows $5,000 and earns $10,000 a vear, he would repay
$200 annually.

Under this system the amount eventually repaid would
vary greatly for the individual debtors. Doctors with high
salaries would pay a higher return than a modestly paid
social worker. Some would pay a great deal more back to the
college than was originally borrowed, and some individuals
would repay considerably less.

Limitations on this system of PAYE are secant. Graduate
students as well as undergraduates can take advantage of
the program. The original ceiling of a loan is $800, which
must be spent toward exclusively educational expenses, That
ceiling is expected to rise as soon as it is deemed feasible

Understandably, this new approach was quite a bomb
shell to college administrators nationwide, The basic concept
of scholarships was being altered some people claimed, The
cost of education is being placed on the beneficiaries, not the
parents of the student, or on the public in the case of state
supported schools, By assuring needy students that money
would be available, Yale has guaranteed qualified students a
right to attend. And as a corollary, the enrollment of minority
vroup students is predicted to jump,

Cite a few universities are awaiting the early outcome ol
this experiment, The Ford Foundation was impressed enough
with the plan's promise that $500,000 has been approved for
the study of Pay as You Earn loans nationwide,

It would be a truly tragic thing if W&L ever had to turn
away qualified men simply because scholarship money was
hort. The young men would suffer and certainly the Univer

sity would suffer, Such a situation does not exist, but is a

definite possibility. The Pay as You Earn plan should be con

BY GAIL DUDLEY

A man and his son are traveling
in a car together when they have a
bad accident. The man is killed,
and his son is critically injured. The
boy is rushed to the operating room
of the nearest hospital. Upon look-
ing at him, the surgeon says, “I
can't operate. This boy is my son.”

This anecdote puzzles even the
most enthusiastic women’s libera-
tion advocate. The irony, of course,
is that the surgeon is a woman.

It is apparent that there is a
difference between the aspirations

and achievements of most American
men and their female counterparts.
Do the surrounding women's col-

 

leges and this universiiy, supposedly
“separate but equal” educational in-
stitutions, enforce this discrepancy’
Perhaps some insight can be gained
through a comparison of two
schools——-WA&L and Hollins.

There are a few surface similari-
ties. Both schools are privately own-
ed liberal arts colleges. They are of
approximately the same size. Both
schools are unisex, Here the parallel
ends.

At Washington and Lee, there is
a much higher degree of professional
orientation. Por example, the Uni-
versity has both a school of com-
merce and a journalism school
There are more course offerings in
the sciences, economics and politics.

There is much greater emphasis
on the arts, English and Philosophy
at Hollins. The only business course
offered is one which “develops ac
curacy, rhythm, and speed in touch
typing; trains students to take
tation and to transcribe accurately
from shorthand notes: and teaches
office procedures, methods of filing,
and the preparation of business re

 

 

Separate But Equal?

  

coneert netted the biggest financial
gain ever for the board and even
surpassed the still talked about Sha-
Na-Na date of last season. With
the past concerts, the upcoming
Fancy Dress, and the future plans
in mind, Dance Board President.

Bert Meem says he anticipates a
year in

“good remainder of the

Hollins:

 

ports.” Hollins also offers educa-
tion courses; W&L does not.

The course of studies at Hollins
is flexible enough to provide for
the student who is considering a
profession. However, such a stu-
dent is treated as an exception; at
WA&L, the profession-oriented  stu-
dent is the rule.

At W&L, there is not a_ single
woman professor, There are female
lab technicians, assistants and secre-
taries. However, the reverse is not
true at Hollins. Approximately 68%
of the teaching faculty is male.
Women comprise a disproportionate
number of lecturers and visiting
professors, however none of the de-
partment chairmen are women, The
president of the college is a man-—
so are the dean, the psychologist,
the chaplain, the business manager,
the physician, and the chairman,
vice chairman, and secretary-treas-
vrer of the Board of Trustees. W&L
even employs a gynecologist; Hol-
lins does not.

Another major diflerence between
the two schools is in the life styles
of the students. The W&L student
has the freedom to choose where
and how he wants to live. Dormi-
tory living is only one option. Stu-
dents can also live off-campus and
function as members of the com-
munity in their dealings with the
landiord (or lady), the grocer, the
gas company. At Hollins, there is
no alternative to on-campus resi-
dence. A student may live in her
ewn room, with another student, or
in a college-owned apartment.
Meais and all other necessities are
provided. Consequently, the Hollins
student has littie direct contact with
the community, and she is required
io make few decisions outside the
academic realm.

The W&L world is not a five-
day one. H exists on week-ends,
too, Despite the introduction of
parietals at Hollins, dormitories
which house large numbers of
women impose restrictions. The
standardization of dormitery rooms
presents a sharp contrast to the
personalized atmosphere of a stu
dent apartment or house. One is a
place where a student stays (or is
kept) for a year; the other is a place
where a student lives.

The Hollins student exists in two
worlds, the academic and the social.
Often. there is little connection be
tween the two. Hollins is the center

of her academic life; she usually
chooses to leave campus for social
purposes.

Segregation of the sexes by plac-
ine them in separate schools makes
it veritably impossible for a man
and a woman to maintain a friend-

ship. The very distance between
WAL and Hollins makes it difficult
for friends to talk to each other

when they need to, and for them to
see each other within an academic,

Sha-Na-Na is scheduled to invade
Washington and Lee again with its
wild antics and songs on Saturday,
February 12 to entertain at the an-
nual Faney Dress dance. Sha-Na-
Na will perform for one-half of the
evening, to be preceeded by a group
called The Embers. The four hour
dance will open doors at 9:00 p.m.
at Evans Dining Hall. Bert Meem
describes the affair as a “greasy
dress, costume deal with dress out
of the 1950's, for example a tuxedo
styled around 1950 or other fashions
in the Sha-Na-Na tradition.” Beer
and wine will be sold at a fraction
above cost and Fancy Dress en-
thusiasts are prohibited from bring-
ing their own beverages, or as Presi-
dent Meem advises, “no B,Y.O.L.!"

Beyond the popular Fancy Dress
date, Dance Board plans are not
definite. Negotiations are under
way with Black Oak Arkansas and
Brewer and Shipley for the March
{1 concert date. That concert will
be the first held in the new gym-
nasiiim and as a result more con-
cert-goers will be able to be ac-
commodated. As it was for the
Gordon Lightfoot concert last No-
vember in the old Doremus gym,

customers had to be turned away
at the door.
For the Spring term, April 29 or

May 13 are the possible dates and
the group being considered is one
from Atlanta which performs The
Who's rock opera, “Tommy.”
Neither the group fer March 11
nor the date or performers for the
Spring concert have been definitely
decided upon, but the groups above
do represent the direction in which
the future plans of the Dance Board
are heading.

The Dance Board acts upon sug-
gestions by board members, who
are in turn acting upon names
heard from people around campus.
Names heard from what Bert Meem
calls “a reasonable number of peo-
ple, say 25-50" are considered at
Dance Board meetings. According
to Meem, “The board maintains
the best possible set-up with its
agent. In fact. he came down for
the Lightfoot concert.”

Price of the groups and availabl:
Dance Board funds are the deciding
factors in negotiations and eventual
bookings by the board. Meem notes.
“We are limited to up-and-coming
or dying groups. We prefer the for-
mer. Although we cannot effectively
compete with the larger universities.
we do extremely well for a school
of our size.”

Whether the Chambers Brothers
or Gordon Lighifoot can be con-
sidered up-and-coming or dying or
either may be debated. In any case.
the drawing power of such enter-
tainers here at Washington and Lee
cannot be disputed. The Dance
Board believes its offerings for the
rest of this season will prove as suc-
cessiul as those of the past.

P.E. Skiing Course
Offered At Homestead,

Draws 108 Students

BY PRESTON SIMPSON

A physical education course in
skiing is being offered to Washing-
ton and Lee students for the first
time this winter. The University’s
athletic department has made ar-
rangements with the Homestead, a
resort in Hot Springs, Virginia, to
allow students to take skiing lessons
from professional instructors at a
reduced rate.

The course may be taken for
credit in physical education or on
an audit basis. It is also open to
faculty and their families. Partici-
pants must pay a fee of $30.00 if
they provide their own equipment
or $42.00 if they rent equipment
from the Homestead. They must
also provide their own transporta-
tion to and from the Homestead.

To complete the course a stu-
dent must spend any six weekday
afternoons at the Homestead be-
tween January 10 and March 3. He
will receive a two-hour lesson from
a staff of professional ski instruc-
tors directed by Sepp Kober. The
rest of the afternoon is for free
practice on the slopes,

The course has never before been
offered to W&L students, but it al-
ready appears to be a success ac-
cording to Coach Dick Miller of the
Washington and Lee Athletic De-
partment, who made the arrange-
ments with the ski school. There
are 98 students taking the course
for credit with another ten people
auditing. Coach Miller stated that
the University is trying to make
physical education more attractive
to students, and he hopes the new
course will be successful toward that
end,

$20,000 Grant
Given To W&XL

Student efforts at Washington and
Lee University have been rewarded
with a $20,000 grant from a North
Carolina foundation to be used in
offering scholarships to economically
disadvantaged students. :

The grant from the Hillsdale
Fund, Inc., of Greensboro was made
as a result of a proposal designed by
the Student Recruitment Commit-
tee at Washington and Lee. an
agency of the student government.

The $20.000 is to be awarded at
the rate of $5,000 a year for four
years, according to terms of the
erant. The first scholarships to quali-
fied students will be awarded in
the 1972-73 year

The Hillsdale Fund award will be
administered by the University Com-
mittee on Student Financial Aid, as
are all scholarship and loan funds.
Student representatives serve on that
committee in matters of policy but
not in the consideration of indivi
dual applications.

Generals Edge Navy, Fall To Lehigh,

BY PALMER TRICE

Even the greatest of all sports
teams go through periods during
which they search for the right
combination, for that certain in-
tangible asset which determines a
championship team. Some teams go
for years without finding it. There
is no guarantee that they ever will.
Tom Landry and his Dallas Cow-
boys have searched since the early
60's for this asset. Not until Coach
Landry decided to start Roger Stau-
bach did the Cowboys find this mys-
terious trait. Well, Coach Verne
Canfield’s Generals are still look-
ing for this key person or combina-
tion. There can be no doubt that
W&L has the talent. Last year's
squad found it early, and ran off
an impressive 17-8 record, Every-
one is back, except that champion-
ship mystique,

This is not to say that the 1971-
72 Generals are to be declared a
major disaster area. There is too
much talent to do that. | would be
the first to admit that this year’s
schedule is tougher than those in
the past. Unlike no. 1 ranked
U.C.L.A., the Generals’ December
schedule was a tenacious one. The
coup detat, of course, was opening
with soon-to-be ranked no. 11 Vir-
ginia. Despite the difficulty of their
early schedule, the Blue B-ballers
took a winning record into the
Christmas holidays.

The hoopers returned early, in
order that they be ready for their
January 5 encounter with the Naval
Academy, at Annapolis. The rivalry

between these two schools has devel-
oped over the last several years, es-
pecially on the basketball court.
The Generals went into the game
with four shooters averaging dou-
ble figures: Mike Daniel, with 22
points a game, Paul McClure, with
15.2 points per contest, Skip Licht-
fuss, with 14.6, and John Glace,
with 14 per game. Offensively,
Washington and Lee was scoring at
a rate of about 85 points a game,
but the usually tough defense was
giving up a little more.

Against the Middies, the Generals
played fairly good ball, until the last
five minutes of the game. Then, for-
tunately for us, Navy wouldn’t even
take the game on a silver platter.
No doubt the Blue defense was
tough during those closing minutes,
but the offense was non-existent.
Charlie Strain’s two foul shots, with
about a minute and a half left, were
all that saved the visitors from de-
feat. Up by as much as 12 during
the second half, the Generals lost
their scoring punch as the game
came to a close. The Midshipmen
closed to 55-52, with 1:45 remain-
ing. Strain’s two foul shots put the
Blue up by five. With 52 seconds
left in the game, the Naval Acad-
emy closed to 57-54, and five sec-
onds later they came within one, At
the 38 second mark, the Middies
controlled a jump ball, The Gen-
erals fell back into a 2-1-2 defense,
and the Middies held the ball for
the last shot. With six seconds re-
maining, they worked the ball in-
side and put it up, only to have big

Paul MeClure block the shot and

game!

On the sixth, Washington and Lee
entertained the Engineers of Lehigh,
within the not so friendly confines
of New Doremus Gymnasium.
From the outset, it was apparent
that the gods on Mount Olympus
were not to be with us, Mighty Zeus
had decreed that the ball should not
and would not go through our bas-
ket. Defensively, Coach Canfield
tried to keep us in the ball game by
employing a variety of defenses, in-
cluding the 1-3-1, the 2-1-2, and a
full-court press. Lehigh scored only
32 points in the first half, but the
host team could only muster 18
points.

In the second half, the Generals
came out pressing, and, amazingly
enough, the ball went through the
hoop. Slowly but surely, the home
town club crept up on the visiting

Paul McClure pulled the Generals

with 4:33 left, Mike Daniel picked
up his fifth foul. The Generals stay-

there. No one was able to hit their
crucial foul shots as the game wan-
ed. The final statistics showed W&L
hitting on only 5 of 21 free throws.
The Generals showed sparks of
their past glory, but still failed to
come up with that one big win.

Monday night, the squad travelled
to Bridgewater. The official statistics
are not yet in, but the Blue seems
to have finally put it all together in
nailing down a convincing 85-70
victory. Paul McClure led the Gen-
erals by scoring 22 points and block-
ing six shots. He also hauled down
18 rebounds in the Blue’s best game
yet. Mike Daniel hit for 20 points,
and Doug Clelan added 18, most of
them coming on long jumpers. The
Generals hit on over fifty per cent
of their shots from the floor and

Trial of the Boobirds

BY BOB “LASH” LARUE

Perhaps a lot of people are
going to be angered by what I have
to say this week, but to those per-
sons | reply with one of Coach
Boyd William's favorite aphorisms:
if the shoe fits, wear it. Thus fore-
warned, read on,

Last week at the Washington and
Lee basketball game with Lehigh, I
noticed among the audience the ap-
palling predominance of a species
of spectator similar to the boobirds
who thrive in such sport cities as
Philadelphia and Baltimore. This
creature finds fault with the officiat-
ing, both the opposing and the home
teams, and just about anything and
everything connected with an event.
The Philadelphia variety have been
known to boo the National Anthem.

Fortunately, this type of boobird
has not reached the southwestern
Virginia area in great numbers.
‘True, there exist some cynics who
laugh at the athletic efforts of not
just the W&L basketball players but
also those in baseball, football and
other sports. And it is only a natural
part of the environment, meaning
our home court, that we would find
a large number of individuals who
criticize the referees, especially
when they rule against the Gen-
erals. As I say, these are somewhat
natural and may be unavoidable.
Nevertheless, | hope neither variety
increases in size in the Lexington
area, for | feel both would be harm-
ful to W&L athletics.

However, to return to the ob-
ject of this excursion, I have no-
ticed that a particular species of the
boobird has taken root here and are
in abundance in the new W&L
gym. This spectator, whenever an
opposing player steps to the foul
line. unloads with a series of whis-
tles, shouts and cat calls designed
(he thinks) to rattle the baliplayer
into missing the foul shot. All kid-
ding aside, this is one of the most
immature and ineffective tactics that
a fan can possibly use. In a word,
its bush. Not only does it reflect
on the school. but it makes one
wonder what kind ef yo-yo donkeys
are sitting in the stands. It is a
thoroughly disgusting gesture, out-
done in stupidity only by the throw-
ing of pennies onto the court. some-
thing which was also childishly pop-
ular over in the old gym a couple

of years ago. And for those of you
who seem to think otherwise, such
noises rarely, more likely never, dis-
turb the foul shooter into missing.

All I can say is, clean up your
act, boobirds. And if there is any-
one who can possibly concoct a de-
fense for such behavior, you're wel-

Captains Named
for ’72 Football

Quarterback Steve Fluharty, of-
fensive lineman Don Eavenson and
linebacker Tim Haley have been
elected tri-captains of the 1972
WA&L football squad,

They were elected by their team-
mates at a post-season squad meet-
ing. All are rising seniors.

Fluharty has won All-State, All-
Conference and All-American
honorable mention honors during
his two years as the Generals’ quar-
terback. As a sophomore, the St.
Petersburg. Florida native ranked
seventh in the nation in passing and
twentieth in total offense. In his
two-year career, he has completed
205 of 427 passes for 2,398 yards
and 14 touchdowns.

Eavenson has been a regular for
the past two years in the W&L of-
fensive line, alternating at guard
and tackle, and consistently graded
high on the offensive line charts.
fhe Abington, Pennsylvania pro-
duct also is a starting defenseman
on W&L’s nationally-ranked lacrosse
team.

Haley called defensive signals for
the Generals from his middle line-
backer post this year. He was sec-
ond in tackling—behind 1971 team
co-captain Dave Brooks—with 66
individual tackles and 19 assists. In
his sophomore season he initiated
52 tackles and was in on $0 more.
He is from Winchester, Virginia.

When a Hollins student comes to

to like his friends and adjust to his

Raising Hogs For Fun and Profit

if you think tolerating your last

But with the return from Christ-

‘Contact ’72’ Announces
Von Hoffman and Heller

Nicholas von Hoffman, Washing-
ton Post columnist and television
personality, and Joseph Heller, cele-
brated author of the comic war
novel Catch-22, will be featured
speakers during the upcoming ‘Con-
tact’ symposium. In addition, it
was announced that prominent Vir-
ginia artist Barclay Sheaks will visit
the W&L campus under ‘Contact’
auspices.

According to ‘Contact’ co-chair-
men Roger Munsick and Skip Pau-
kert, von Hoffman will talk about
“The Problems of ‘loday’s Jour-
nalist.” His address is scheduled for

Wednesday, February 2, at 8 p.m.
in Lee Chapel,
Heller will be the concluding

speaker in this year’s ‘Contact’ pro-
gram, slated for Wednesday, Feb-
ruary 9, also at 8 p.m. in the Cha-

pel.

The remaining speakers in the
symposium will be revealed next
week,

Von Hoffman, who is considered
to be in the vanguard of the “New
Journalism” movement, is well-
known to Post readers for his regu-
lar commentary on the front page
of the ‘Style’ section. He is also fre-
quently seen debating issues with
James J. Kilpatrick on CBS televi-
sion’s “Sixty Minutes” and the
“CBS Morning News.”

The outspoken von Hoffman has
been a Post staff writer for five
years, His books include “Mississip-
pi Notebook,” “We Are the Chil-
dren Our Parents Warned Us
Against.” “Two, Three Many More,”
and “Left at the Post.”

CR’s Sponsor Congressman

Heller is a Phi Beta Kappa gra-
duate of New York University and
received a Master's degree from
Columbia, He subsequently studied
at Oxford as a Fulbright Scholar.

After flying more than sixty mis-
sions as a B-25 bombadier during
the Second World War, he worked
as an advertising copywriter until
beginning Catch-22 in 1953, Work-
ing after hours and during vaca-
tions, he completed the work eight
years later,

Heller's play, We Bombed in New
Haven was produced on Broadway
and was termed by Newsweek, “very
likely the most powerful play about
contemporary irrationality an
American has written.” He has
written a stage version of Catch-22
which is headed for Broadway.

Heller's second novel, Something
Happened, is scheduled for publica-
tion in the near future. He is also
the author of several articles and
film scripts.

Barclay Sheaks, one of Virginia's
most prominent painters, is a gradu-
ate of Virginia Commonwealth Uni-
versity, and the Richmond Profes-
sional Institute. He will present a
demonstration of watercolors and
acrylics in the Student Center on
Monday, February 7.

Sheaks has exhibited paintings
in museums throughout the country,
including the Mobile Art Gallery,
the Virginia Museum, the Corcoran
Gallery of Art, and the National
Academy of Design. His work has
been reproduced in “Prize Winning
Art.” and he has written pamphlets

Robinson To Speak

Congressman J, Kenneth Robin-
son will speak on Thursday, Janu-
ary 20 at 7:30 in Lee Chapel. He
is a member of the U.S. House of
Representatives from the Seventh
District of Virginia. His speech is
being sponsored by the Washington
and Lee University Republican
Club.

Mr. Robinson will be introduced
by Mr. Charles Phillips, Mayor of
Lexington and an Economics Pro-
fessor at Washington and Lee. Con-
gressman Robinson will speak on
the topic of “Military Appropria-
tions and U.S, Defense Posture”

A Republican, Robinson was

elected to Congress for the first
time in 1970. He was recently ap-
pointed to the House Appropriations
Committee, a great honor for a
Freshman Representative. During
his first term, Robinson has earned
a reputation among Democrats and
Republicans alike as being an ex-
ceedingly hard working representa-
tive, a reputation which greatly con-
tributed to his being named to the
House Appropriations Committee.

Following the address, there will
be a reception for Congressman
Robinson in the University Center
Cockpit, Both functions are open
to the public.

Group To Study
Honor System

A special study group is being
formulated to provide an extensive
review of the W&L honor system,
and this week the four juniors
spearheading the effort are calling
for help from any interested stu
dents.

The study group will conduct a
series of interviews with
persons, ¢.g., professors,
dent body officers,
sels of past public honor trials, and
representatives of other schools who
might shed some light on the pres
ent problems and possible solutions
concerning the system. The
will then disseminate the gathered
information by publishing reports
weekly in the Ring-tum Phi.

“Our interviews will be followed
by an overall review and appraisal
of the accumulated material,” said
a spokesman for the group. “This
data and the groups evaluation will
then be presented to the student
body.” The nucleus of juniors re
sponsible for the idea included Bob
Brennan, Archer Frierson, Rick
Gray, and Bill Merrill

The study group has been sanc
tioned by the EC, but it was em
phasized that they will operate on a
totally independent basis. The pur
pose of the weekly
Ring-tum Phi will be to inform the
student body as the examination pro

| OUTLOOK and}

January 19, 1972

In 1914 Omicron Delta Kappa, America’s foremost lead-

ership fraternity, was founded at Washington and Lee Uni-2

versity. One of the original undergraduate founders, Rupert
Nelson Latture, is still actively contributing to the Univer-
sity.

It was Latture and his roommate who were instrumental
in the founding of the society. They had hoped to form a
group where leaders of both the student body and faculty
could interchange ideas. At, that time. this undergraduate
served the University as a student instructor in French. The
two roommates concluded that a society was needed “to,
recognize all campus leaders.” The concept was warmly re-
ceived by professors at W&L and Dr. Henry Louis Smith,’
president of the school.

It was Latture who drafted the design of the Omicron
Delta Kappa key. In his words “I took two coins out of my
pocket and drew a circle incorporating the letters ‘ODK’ and
15 stars, representing the 15 founding members.”

Latture commented, “It never occurred to us that the soe-
iety would spread as it has to other universities.” However,”

the leadership fraternity has grown to more than 115 chapters

on campuses nationwide. OD is recognized as the most
prestigous honor for collegiates outside Phi Beta Kappa .

Although Rupert Latture is: best known perhaps as a
founder of ODK, his contributions and loyalty to W&L are
astounding. He received his bachelor’s degree in 1915 with
the highest grades in his class, and acquired his master’s de-
gree just a year later from Washington and Lee. After an
absence of a few years (service in World War I and the Croix
de Guerre), he returned to teach once again at W&L. Lat
ture was a teacher of Political Science for the next five de-

cades. At the age of 70 Professor Latture left his teaching ... The Ring-tum Phi has received

tasks and became a special advisor to the president of Wash-
ington and Lee University. Today Rupert Nelson Latture
works full time in Washington Hall, which brings you to the
point of this entire editorial: Monday was Professor Latture’s
cightieth birthday. Professor Latture, you have done so much
for this institution over a period of 60 years that it boggles
the senses. The Ring-tum Phi thanks you for what you have
done, and are doing. Congratulations on your eightieth birth-
day!

J.W.R.

Another service organization bites the dust. The Circle
K Club. directionless and discouraged, decided to fold last
week. Not only did its members lack the enthusiasm needed to
make a service effort successful, but the community response
as well had been apparently lackluster.

The fact is that, in-past years,“W&L service clubs have
largely depended on fraternities for recruitment and organiza-
tion, Since the fraternities have rapidly lost about every ves-
tige of their one-time campus control, many worthy activities
have ironically suffered as a result, The once-touted Student
Service Society, for instance, is a campus mystery. It has
lately crept in and out of the-eampus scene, like the fog, with
nary a good deed left behind to affirm its existence.

One wonders whether or not it is worth the trouble to
once more decry that proverbial W&L malady; Apathy, But
despite the demise and/or dormancy of the organizations
mentioned above, there still remains plenty of work to be
done, and ample channels exist to direct sincere community
involvement.

The premier outlet for student energy is the University
Federation. A group whieh has threatened to founder at its
moorings during the last several years, the Federation has
now become an active, dynamic focus for social projects under
the leadership of Bob Foley, Blessed with a sizable budget
and a conscientious membership, the University Federation
is surely the organization to join for those who wish to follow
through on their community concern.

A second opportunity for student involvement is offered
by the tutorial program conducted in conjunction with the
Lexington school system, This project has been praised by
local teachers and principals, but student participation: has
fallen off since Christmas. Those who have worked in the pro-
gram have attested to its rewards, and students are asked to
devote no more than one or two hours a week to help Lexing-
ton children learn. Contact Professor Ray (Payne 3218) or
Professor Imeson (Howe 313) for details.

Washington and Lee had seemingly been transformed two
years ago, when suddenly, after Kent State and the Cambodian
venture, the students were lifted from the daily routine and
mobilized to express boldly their concern. The action and in-
volvement during that well-remembered May was unpre-
cedented.

What has happened since? One is tempted to fall into eyn-
icism, to suggest that all that stirring social concern lasted
only as long as the students felt the threat of their own per-
sonal reeruitment into the Vietnam ranks,

Those who profess true social concern must prove the
cynies wrong; it is up to them to demonstrate that their ideals
are more than mere ephemeral notions, It is time for all W&L
students to consider giving up just one or two hours out of the
week to offer the underpriviledged in the community some-
thing more than words.

Two representatives of Randolph-

R-M is a close knit community

Despite my growing unrest over
the Nixon administration, 1 have
seen no viable alternative that can
produce anything but the same
bland statism the President has been
engaged in for the past four years.
No major figure in either camp is
anything but a hollow echo of
Nixon; none of these presidential
hopefuls would return to us any of
our personal liberties or work in
any way to reverse the trend of
mania which is rapidly turning free
citizens into blind slaves of an om-
nipotent state.

Nixon’s own party has no real
choice except retention of the Chief
Executive as their standard-bearer.
Not only is Nixon too firmly en-
trenched within the Republican
power structure to be unseated with-
out a destructive struggle, but he
has, as well. an exposure to the
public eye that very few potential
rivals can equal, Both ef Nixon's

A co-curricular program sponsored
by the YWCA provides many op-
portunities for social involvement
in such inner-city activities as
the Headstart Program, a training
school and hospital for the handi-
capped, and recreation programs in
Lynchburg. Extracurricular activi-
ties include the Student Govern-
ment Association, an award winn-
ing newspaper, a literary magazine,
the yearbook, and many clubs and
committees. FOCUS, a lively and
ambitious student group, sponsors
programs on problems of modern
life. This year’s symposium will
focus on consumerism and the key-
note speaker will be Ralph Nader,

The class schedule at R-M is de-
signed to provide time for independ-
ent study, Most classes meet only
twice a week, Wednesday morning
is reserved for study, and there are
no classes on Saturday. A wide var-
iety of courses are offered at R-M;
for example, the Department of

It is stimulating and to some
degree frightening to watch the

For the past three years he has pur-

with such a degree of smoothness
that it is almost diabolical, Without

Mary Baldwin. We will be showing
the men the house where they will
stay next year on the edge of our
campus and discuss any details
which they may be interested in
knowing about the college.

I'm sorry that we are unable to
provide transportation, but | hope
that the men can work out their
own arrangements. We are asking
the men to arrive here between 9:00
and 9:30 so that they can have a
full day on the campus, We also
apologize for being unable to pro-
vide housing at this time, The men
can spend the night in the local
YMCA at a very nominal cost,
however.

If any of your students might be

please tet me know, I hope that
there will be a good turn out.

Odd Thoughts

BY BOB “LASH” LARUE

A few-odd thoughts born over the
weekend while breaking the ice in
my battery . Washington and
Lee’s swimming team made an in-
auspicious debut in their new aquar-
ium, losing to a youthful Virginia
Tech crew. But, if a sense of vic-
tory is reflective of one’s environ-
ment, the Generals should win all
their remaining home contests...

Swim Coach Bill Stearns’ new
playpool is one of the swankest
around, with upper level stands and

closed circuit television for those ‘

patrons who cannot see the action
/ My only complaint is that
Coach Norman Lord, who acted as
starter for swim meet, should  at-
tempt to find a muffler for his start-
ing gun. He’s got mufflers, but I'm
afraid the fans do not.

The city of Dallas came away
a double victor this past weekend.
The Cowboys cruised to a 24-3 win
over Miami in the Super Bowl to
claim the NFL championship, while
Terry Daniels, a product of SMU,
impressed viewers as a tenacious op-
ponent despite his fourth round
TKO loss to Smokin’ Joe Frazier.

Word has it that W&L Athletic
Director William McHenry is chair-
ing a Steering Committee which is
investigating the possible formation
of an athletic conference made up
of Virginia’s small colleges.

Contrary to popular rumor, | am
no relation to “Bruiser LaRue”,
whose interview has been aired fre-
quently over the radio stations. This
character, in a less than masculine
voice, affirms his love for piling on
and touch...

On the whole, I was a bit dis-
appointed by Super Bowl VI. The
Dallas victory was a classic example
of experience triumphing over a
team unfamiliar with big-game pres-
sure. But, if the Dolphins can bol-
ster their defense with the addition
of a seasoned linebacker, Miami
could be the AFC’s team of the
20's . . . And don’t be surprised

Washington and Lee's wrestling 4

team will take on undefeated Day
idson Friday night in the Ged

New W&L wrestling coach John
Piper will send his Generals onto
the mat at 7:30 against Davidson,
which is undefeated in three meets.
W&L enjoys a 2-2 record for: the

Generals Fall 86-68;

BY PALMER TRICE

The Hoopers of General Lee's
University challenged the Quakers
of Guilford College last Friday
night and Jost another tough con-
test, Few in Big Lex have heard of
this small North Carolina school.
the host team carried a 7-4 record
into the contest. Known mostly for
their run and shoot offense, the
Crimson and Grey had averaged al-
most 96 points per game during. this
no longer young season. The Quak-
ers figured to be tough to run with,
ind so the Generals sought to. avoid
this, The Blue were outrebounded
and outshot, even though they suc-
ceeded in making the home team
play W&L’s game for much of the
contest.

fhe Generals started off quickly,
grabbing an early lead. Led by the
scoring of captain Mike Daniel and
he rebounding of big Paul Me-
Clure, the Blue owned a 29-21 lead
with 4:55 to go in the first half.
Then the Generals hit a cold streak,
during which they gained only two
points. At the end of the first half,
re team trailed by 37-31.

The Generals refused to roll over
ied die. They stormed back early in
the second half, and gained a tie at
39. But from there on out, the Gen-
erals fell slowly but surely behind.
t in foul trouble and stayed

McClure fouled out, and
Daniel and Lichtfuss ended with
four apiece.

[hev g

mn tM,

The Generals played exception-
ally well for much of the first half,
but then ran into trouble. The Quak-

Florida Pres. Next

ers, who play out of the Carolina
Conference, certainly proved to be
no pushover, as the final 86-68
score indicates. The Blue faced a
tall, quick team in Guilford’s Quak-
ers. They played well, but couldn't
quite put it all together. The de-
fense has proved consistent, but
the offense has been erratic, and
anything but well-balanced,

VPI Dunks
Tankers, 63-50

The Virginia Tech Gobblers, be-
fore a capacity crowd at the New
Doremus swimming pool, spoiled
W&L’s inaugural event by defeating
the Generals 63-50. After taking an
early lead, W&L, still looking slug-
gish after Christmas break, fell vic-
tim to the young but talented VPI
team. Good performances by Bim
Clark and Bert Meem, winners in
the 50 yard free style and 200 yard
butterfly, respectively, were not
enough. The 400 yard medley relay
was also won by the W&L line-up
of Hal Catlin, Rick McCain, John
Lawlor, and Bim Clark. VPE took
every other event.

Friday's defeat left the Generals
2.1 for the season. This weekend
they travel to West Virginia Wesle-
yan, It will be interesting to see if
WAL, very strong in the freestyle
and butterfly, can beat a well bal-
anced team, such as Duke, Virginia,
or Johns Hopkins.

teristic of Republican Party dogma
and doctrine. He hasn't made these
changes out of moral enlightenment
but for the purpose of political
power.

So the cynics say what's the prob-
lem, all men are guided by self-in-
terest and we should only be happy
that Nixon's self-interested activity
is working toward the advancement
of the country, This may be true
but I tend to think that in spite of
the predominance of contrary evi-
dence there are moral men in this
world guided by other motivations
than pure self- interest. I mentioned
that though there are indicators of
a regeneration of our country we
are still sick, The sickness comes
from corrupt leadership through-
out the nation, The corruption has
become so common that it is gradu-
ally becoming acceptable. Accom-
panying this acceptance which some
would call realism and others would
label as sophistication is an un-
avoidable loss of innocence which is
pervaded by corruption itself. In
other words, the lack of morality on
the part of the leadership of any
group will inevitably infect the
whole people. Result? The decline
of the people and ultimately self-
destruction,

KEEPSAKE DIAM

HOW TO PLAN YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND WEDDING

Thus, we are confronted with a
paradox which | stated above, that
is, the coming forth of good from
evil, How will history judge Rich-
ard Nixon? History deals in facts
and thus it is not unreasonable to
predict a favorable evaluation of
the Nixon years. The presence of
immoral leadership is a difficult
thing to document and it is likely
that any such speculative evalua-
tions as this will be largely ignored,
Thus if the fruit is succulent and
sweet except for a maggot-infested
cores was the consumed sweetness
from a rotten fruit?

Nixon hopefully will fall prey
to the handy maxim that you can't
fool all the people all of the time.
For despite his surface doctoring of
the desperately ill patient he will
not heal the deeper sicknesses of
cynicism, expediency and disillu-
sion, Only moral leadership will
heal these ills.

So what is the answer? Indica-
tions are that Nixon will be re-
elected (after all he's been cam-
paigning for four years) and the
men who appear to be morally
principled can't break into the com-
plex semi-permeable membrane
which envelopes the leadership hier-
archy of our country. I have given
as much of an answer as I have, |
have only the observation that the
direction we are going is being
speedily followed and the potential
damage of another four years of
Tricky Dick is frightening.

Small: No Alternative To Nixon

(Continued from page 2)

from these renegades, Although
Yorty could present a strong and
decisive campaign quite able to
topple Nixon's carefully engineered
politics, he does not have the back-
ing from his party fellows to win
the nomination. Wallace, on the
other hand, will cut heavily cut into
Nixon's vote without any more
harm aside from, quite possibly, re-
placing one political mechanic with
another.

This is not a year for charisma
and youth, It is rather a time of
slick campaigns and slicker politi-
cians. The Common Man cannot
hope to win in this election: with
some luck, he might manage a draw,
but that basic requirement of cour-
age and conviction which could toss
the statists from their mighty
thrones appears to have deserted the
major rivals and left behind an in-
sane desire to follow the trend of
oppression we have become accus-
tomed to. It is not a pleasing pro-
spect: we can only hope that the

future will produce statesmen more
concerned with public welfare than
in the cheap gamesmanship of poli-
tics.

UC Discusses Coeducation

(Continued from page 1)
He suggested that a commitment
could thus be made anytime to go
coed, and that this commitment
would be fulfilled when the univer-
sity has expanded,

A concern was also expressed by
Jarrett on alumni reaction to an
immediate move to coeducation, A
“loss of identification with W&L”
was feared by most observers.

Lewis Powell, student, then ex-
pressed that W&L has “a respon-
sibility to remain male.” He noted
the recent trend in Eastern schools
to go coed and theorized that if the
trend continued, there would deve-
lop a definite limiting factor in giv-
ing men a choice as to whether they
would prefer to attend a coed in-
stitution or not. He also expressed
the fear that coeducation and ex-
pansion in general might adversely
affect the Honor System.

Steve Robinson, President of the
Student Body, then summed up his
feclings as a student on the issue.
He noted that if W&L expanded,
there would be a need for more
room, but if it remained at its pres-
ent size and went coed, the athletic
program and the fraternities would
be threatened. On the other hand,
he stated that coeducation would
“help Lexington . . . It’s good to
have women in the classroom, too.”

Dr. Edward Pinney then express-
ed what he thought might be a “de-
ceptively simple” opinion on the is-
sue and rhetorically asked, “Why
can't we just take 10, 50, 75, 100,
or even 300 women this fall? The
only thing stopping us is the rule
disqualifying women.” He mention-
ed that there would thus be no need
to physically “replace” men, but
rather, W&L would assimilate
women year by year.

Dr. Jarrett stated in support of
the issue, “If you hold out on na-
tional trends (going coed), it puts
you in a difficult position.” He of-
fered that W&L would draw a
“much finer student body” by going
coed, The doctor again cited the in-
crease of applications at Yale,
Princeton, and other colleges recent-
ly going coed, and noted that a
much finer selection of students

would result,

Dr. Hodges then brought up
subject of W&L’s unique statur
and said, “if a small liberal arts co
lege is to survive, it must be uniq
and there must be a demand for i
uniqueness.”

On this, President Huntley e)
pressed the unique quality of W&l
“There is no other institution in tl
United States of our size with th
breadth of curriculum which w
have, The values of a small colleg
campus—that is our quality, Ot
potential for uniqueness is that w
are small, deep, and broad in aci
demic terms, and we do it operatin
in the black.

“What will a significant variabl
(coeducation) do?” he continued, “
is a question of whether coeducatio
is important enough to have to b
introduced as a variable .. . whet!
er or not it is undesirable for W&
to seek and achieve cocducation ¢
its present size.”

The meeting thus closed on a
air of uncertainty as to what kins
of stand the U.C. would take o
the issue of coeducation at W&l
It was motioned that both coedu
cation and the Honor System b
brought up for discussion at th
next meeting.

Poet W. H. Auden ‘To Give Reading Here

One of the most influential liter-
ary figures of the twentieth century,
W. H. Auden, will visit Washing-
ton and Lee to deliver a reading
of his poetry on Tuesday, February
8. The program will begin in Lee

Chapel at 8 p.m., under the au-
spices of CONTACT.
The complete CONTACT  pro-

gram has now been announced, ac-
cording to the program co-chair-
men, Roger Munsick and Skip Pau-
kert. Already named as participants,
from February 1-9, are former In-

umnist Nicholas von Hoffman, U.S.
Senator William Brock, film director

ninth year,

Mr. James Boatwright, a W&l
Professor of English, will lead a
preview of readings and discussion,
“W. H. Auden: the Man and his
Poetry” in the Bookstore at 8 p.m.
on Thursday, February 3. Coffee
and cookies will be served.

Auden himself will talk to. stu-
dents at an informal discussion to
be held in Fairfax Lounge of the
University Center on February 8,
beginning at 4 p.m.

and author Joseph

W. H. Auden is considered by
many critics to be the greatest
living poet writing in English, In
addition, the versatile and_ prolific

Auden is known as a reviewer, es-
sayist, dramatist, translator, libret-
tist, educator, and editor.

He has been the recipient of num-
crous awards, including the Pulitzer
Prize, the National Book Award,
the Bollingen Prize for Poetry, the
Guinness Poetry Award, and the
National Medal for Literature,

Auden was born in York, England,
and was trained in biology at Gres-
ham’s School, Holt. While attend-
ing Christ Church, Oxford, from
1925 to 1928, he became part of a
literary circle, which included Step-

hen Spender, C, Day Lewis, and
Christopher Isherwood, His friends
saw him during those college days
as somewhat of a deliberate clown-
er, “a peculiar amalgam of mental
surgeon, witchdoctor and buffoon,”
according to critic Dennis Davison.
An early verse play, Paid on
Both Sides written in Berlin in 1928,
was termed “brilliant” by T. S. Eliot,
and the young poet began to make a
stir in the British reading public of
the Thirties. During his days in
Berlin, Auden married Erika Mann,
daughter of the famed German
novelist Thomas Mann, in order for
her to gain passport to England.
Auden, however, continued to
travel, to Iceland, China, and Spain,

along
with the left-wing
struggles there. The two
surprised England in 1939
when they left to reside in the
United States, Auden continued to
confound the literary public when
he soon professed his acceptance
of Christianity.

The poet has been an American
since 1946, living in New York. He
also maintains a spring and summer
home in Kirchstetten, Lower Aus-
tria. Auden served as Professor of
Poetry at Oxford from 1956-1961.

He has authored several volumes
of verse, among them, About the
House, Homage to Clio, The Age of
Anxiety, and Selected Poetry, Col-

where he became indentified,
with Isherwood,
political
men

THE RING-TUM PHI

Washington and Lee University’s Weekly Newspaper

lected Shorter Poems, and Collected
Longer Poems. Various essays have
been published in The Enchafed
Flood and The Dyer’s Hand.

Auden’s most recent book is a
collection of readings entitled An
Uncertain World, In adition to au
thoring two plays with Christopher
Isherwood, he has scored libretti
for operas by Stravinsky (The
Rake’s Progress) and Benjamin Brit-

Coed Referendum
Planned For Spring

The Executive Committee has de-
cided to place a referendum to as-
sess sentiment concerning coeduca-
tion on the ballot for Student Body
elections in the spring. Meanwhile,
they announced their intention to
take an official position on the is-
sue themselves, after all EC mem-
bers have read the report of the
faculty Coeducation Committee.

Junior Kurt Krumperman appear-
ed before the EC in their Monday

meeting to request action on the
coeducation issue. He said it was
time for a representative student

voice to respond to the co-ed re-
port, and that the EC “has every
responsibility to act.”

At their last session the members
of the University Council discussed
the question for over two hours
without resolving a position. They
plan, however, to resume their dis-
cussion at their next meeting on
February 3. Student Body Presi-
dent Steve Robinson has urged all
interested students to attend the
open discussion of the UC at that
time.

Krumperman suggested that the
faculty's coeducation report, written
by a team headed by Religion Pro-
fessor Louis Hodges, contains “sev
eral underlying assumptions about
the nature of women and their
needs which may be invalid.”

the thrust of the report, which
was completed just recently, is that
the cost of bolstering several de-
partments (e.g., Fine Arts, English)
to accommodate women in an exX-
panded university of 1800-2000 stu
dents would be considerable. The
report also said, however, that if the
university decided to gradually ad-
mit women, keeping the present
size of enrollment stable, the costs

OUTLOOK and REVIEW!

January 26, 1972

On Coeducation.

Coedueation is a blossoming issue at Washington and Lee.

Through necessity it seems, the School of Law recently de-
cided to accept coeds next fall. The law school had, to establish
an open door poicy for women and minority groups in order to
remain accredited by certain orgapizations,, Despite this turn-
about in formal admissions policy, most observers do not
anticipate a deluge of skirts:in Tucker: Hall. Truthfully, this
move to partial coeducation appears inconsequential con-
cerning the W&L community,

What appears more consequential is evidence of a grow-
ing undergraduate desire for regularly enrolled women at
WA&L. This desire can largely be coupled with a degree of
frustration. This frustration was obvious at the dast Univer-
sity Council meeting. Quoting from@ast week's Ring-tum Phi:
“The University Council . . . deliberated for,over two hours
and adjourned without resolution on the subject of coeduca-
tion at Washington and Lee.” The Council heard from Dr.
Louis Hodges, chairman of a recent comprehensive study on
the issue of coeducation. Dr. Hodges relayed the committee's
sentiment, “It was unanimous that it would be in the best
interest of the university to become coeducational.”

Some students may have been severely disappointed that
the University Council did not take a stronger stand either for
or against coeducation. Realizing that only the Board of
‘Trustees can alter W&L's centuries old male-only philoso-
phy, students are asking how they can express their thoughts
to the Trustees? One approach was investigated a week ago.
More than 30 students and. a faculty member met to examine
the possibility of endorsing a Student Body President candi-
date who would take an outspoken pro-coeducation stand.
Surely; the Trustees would have little difficulty: interpreting
such a candidate's victory.

The results of this meeting in Fairfax Lounge were quite
intriguing. Kurt Krumperman, an organizer of the session,
claimed that “the elections around here have been basically
issueless.”” Many people in attendance last Wednesday en-
couraged that coeducation be made into an issue this spring.
After all, the Student Body President is the most highly aud-
ible undergraduate spokesman. Krumperman shunned the
idea of getting anyone in particular elected, “Coedueation is
the main purpose of this meeting not polities.”

Bob Brennan attended this caucus and raised a logical ob-
jection to this election approach, Brennan stated that “the
President of the Student Body handles honor trials; that is
his chief responsibility. A  pro-coeducation candidate might
not be capable of conducting the proceeding of the Honor
System. Once this issue (coeducation) is gone you're stuck
with someone who couldn't help maintain the Honor System.”

This idea of making candidates take a stand on central
issues makes sense, but not at the risk of deluting. the Honor
System. This does not connote that the Honor System is
above suspicion or change, but it does mean the election of the
chief protector of the Honor Systeme the President. of the Stu-
dent Body, should not be decided on an issue he cannot settle.
Remember, only the Trustees can bring about coeducation.
Nonetheless, W&L students should express their views con-
cerning coeducation in the upcoming Mareh voting. Candi-
dates for the University council should be needled into making
stands on such salient issues as coeducation, Or possibly, as
another conerete measurement of the undergraduates’ senti-
ments, a referendum for a resolution could be voted into
effect during the regular March balloting, The resolution
could implore the Trustees to consider the student viewpoint,
Similar resolutions and certain amendments to the Student

tody Constitution have been previously attempted during the
spring electioneering period.

The faculty, administration, and student body are all con-
cerned about coeducation at W&L. The faculty and admini-
stration have made their study, The student body had better
voice a “yea or nay” soon, or this issue could be settled with-
out its influence. Via the March Student Body cleetions the
will of the undergraduates can be gauged, But please, do not
allow the next President of the Executive Committee to be
cleeted solely beeause of his inconsequential views on the
merits or faults of coeducation, Better methods of expressing
your views are available.

Letters On Parking, Girls...

Parking Causes Dismay

To the Editor of. The Ring-tum Phi:

As one of the members of Wash-
ington and. Lee’s large apathetic, seg-
ment,it is a rare phenomenon that
should motivate me. to, write to the
Ring-tum Phi, The reason for this,
of course,,is that 1 have come. to
expect little or nothing to come of
such efforts to. change something.

| have often wanted in the past to
express my dismay over several bad
aspects of what is otherwise a very
fine institution, I have been dis-
tressed, for one thing, over a school
within, this school . which, provides
some of. its professors, with strange
ego, trips, in. the form of giving
grades one grade below other de-
partments. | have yet to see the
benefits of this other. than: (1) It
serves to lower cumulative averages
and keeps more students off Dean's
List, (2) helps to create a feeling in
the  grader’s mind, similar, perhaps
to successful completion of a
Charles«Adas course, and43) helps
w reaffirm that all-important fear
of the Big C which Washington and
Lee students must maintain,

| have-also wanted, in the past, to
state my feeling that it is wrong
for a W&L student in the year 1972
to still have to verge on a sexual
fit when an attractive Hollins girl
walks through Lexington on a Wed-
nesday. The exchange program has
obviously been an optimistic attempt
to appease our natural desires for
natural relationships with members
of the other sex, But when one con-
siders that on any two “big week-
ends” W&L students will travel. in
the neighborhood of a quarter of a
million miles just to get dates, one
must judge the program as a failure
in this respect. It has failed in many
other more important areas too, as
girls on this campus will attest.

But the true incentive for this

Blows Against The Empire

“letter to the editor” comes .ncither
from my feelings about genuine co-
education or Newcombland, Rather,
it pertains to what should be a far
more. simple problem to solve:
PARKING! Indeed, after three years
of shouting at the walls of my room
over these other problems the great
motivational force to put. my gripes
in public print-came as a result of a
soggy white piece of paper jammed
under the windshield wiper of my
Volkswagon, “Your car is parked
in a ‘Restricted Parking’ area,” it
said, “2nd offense.” Whammo!!.. .
$5.00.

Now this makes me very unhappy.
Where, if 1 may ask,.am I supposed
to. park?. At the beginning of this
year | bought from Washington and
Lee University, at the price of
$15.00, a little yellow. sticker which
I thought entitled me to park my
car for classes, No one informed
me at the time that this meant park-
ing it half-a-mile away, from Wash-
ington.and Lee University.

Some students, | know, can park
in the lot in front of the Hill. This
is fine if you want to get up at 7:30
am, to find a space for your E
hour class. Also it provides. you
with an early morning challenge to
see if you can get by Rick Middle-
ton’s white Electra, the W&L dump-
ster tractor, the rest of the over-
night Phi Kap cars, and into that
seven foot slit between Alvin's and
Dennis’ cars. Other students have
chosen the VMI lot nearest duPont
Hall. This too is fine if you wish to
challenge the elements by charging
up and down a thirty foot ravine
where one also finds the true mean-
ing of mud and campus dogs.

Surely there is a better way. I, for
one, am now out $21.00 to this
school for the “privilege” of playing
hide and seek games with Murph
(who, | might add is only doing his
job). | find this incredibly ludicrous

Controversy Brewing

BY W. PATRICK HINELY

We have a potential controversy
brewing here on our otherwise nor-
mally apathetic campus, If we as
students decide to make an_ issue
of coeducation, we CAN have great
power in determining the outcome,
It will take some doing, but so did
the events of May, 1970. That got
WAL into the 20th Century.

There will be no danger from
outside agitators. Coeducation is a
very dead issue most everywhere.
Other colleges, for the most part,
have recognized the artificial na-
ture of sexually segregating their
student bodies, I have read remarks
of some leading educators who ar-
gue that sexual segregation is detri-
mental to a good education, and
very few disagree with them, |
can’

It is certainly true that W&L
would lose one of its distinctions
which makes this school so “uni-
que;” we would no longer be the
oldest all-male school in the United
States. | am sure the handkerchief
business in Lexington would enjoy
a great boom, singe we'd all be cry-
ing so much if we lost such a mean-
ingful distinction.

At the last meeting of the Uni-
versity Council, Dr, Louis Hodges
reported on the findings of the com-
mittee set up to investigate coedu-

ally unfavorable administration view
toward them have pushed a few of
the weaker houses over the edge,
but most have weathered the storm

porary,
meaningful enough to survive,
Someone said WAL has a respon-
sibility to remain all-male in order
to give those who wish to attend a
men's school a wider choice of
schools to attend, It is equally
valid to say we have a responsibil-
ity to go coed to give potential WAL
students of BOTH sexes a wider
choice of coed schools to attend,
Besides, no one of either sex would
be FORCED to associate with mem-
bers of the opposite sex outside the
classroom, though | would have my
doubts about the normality of those
who might wish to segregate them
selves, Of course, everyone is en
titled to their own bag. Many her
mits live in New York City; Im
sure our campus has room for a

few. The statement that coeducation
would threaten the honor system
was also made. I have yet to glean
any meaningful enlightenment from
that assertion.

Dr. Hodges pointed out that most
schools which have recently gone
coed have enjoyed “happy” results,
This seems logical, especially for the
students. He also cited the fact that
going coed has raised those schools’
academic calibre, in general.

There are three main choices un-
der consideration for W&L: (1) go-
ing coed and expanding, (2) going
coed and remaining at our present
size, and (3) maintaining the status
quo. Choice No. | was most favor-
ably received at the U.C, meeting,
but No, 2 makes more sense if
WAL is to retain the advantages of
being a small school. If we expand
and go coed, we'll be just another
moderately-sized coed school. Re-
maining at our present size and go-
ing coed will keep us more acade-
mically sound, as far as calibre of
students is concerned, and we as
students will continue to enjoy the
superior qualities of being educat-
ed in a small school. Choice No, 3
has no supporting arguments, unless
you happen to enjoy driving at
least ten miles for female com-
panionship, and often forty or fifty.
(Sem just isn't big enough for all
of us, nor does it appeal to all of
us.)

Last week, a group of students
met to discuss the possibility of
putting up a candidate for student
body president whose platform
would be based on favoring coedu-
cation, This certainly wouldn't hurt
the political process at WAL. Sev-
eral observations came out of that
meeting:

An all-male institution creates

an unreal atmosphere in which

the masculine view point is dom-
inant,

WAL presently functions as an

elitist institution.

THERE IS NO LEGITI-

MATE REASON WHY WA&L

COULD NOT GO COED.

| certainly can't argue against

those statements.

Unfortunately, the Board = of
Trustees, who must be persuaded to
favor coeducation, can and very
well might argue with those state-
ments, | just hope they will listen to
what Dr. Hodges’ report has to say
Let us hope they will see the rea
soning in favor of coedueation and
put an end to the socially artificial
and at times farcical nature of WAL
as it now exists,

If they don't, we as students owe
it to ourselves and those who will
take our places when we get out into
the “real” world to make our opi-
nions heard, If we voice them loud
enough and in the correct manner,
| am sure they will be listened to
We have the power to make sure

they ARE listened to,

and as,a result I shall not. pay my
latest fine until some administra-
tion member explains what is to be
done about this problem and when.
I suggest that other students do the
same,

1 do not think that Washington
and Lee should be discussing new
housing, law schools, and libraries,
until it completes unfinished busi-
ness. Parking facilities are unfinish-
ed_ business.

Jim Fernald °73

Is Coeducation Justified?

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

One point which I think has been
neglected in the discussion on co-
education at W&L is that in order
to justify such a sweeping altera-
tion of the University, the advan-
tages to be gained must significant-
ly outweigh not only the direct dis-
advantages of change but also the
considerations which militate against
abandoning the traditional nature
of the school.

None of the arguments presented
in last week's article on the Univer-
sity Council discussions promises
such an adyantage. The academic
standards here are already high,
and no one can promise more than
a marginal increment from the ad-
mission of women. The fact that it
would allow the admissions office
to send out more rejection notices
somehow does not strike me as a
plus.

An “improvement” in the social
and academic “atmosphere” is a
questionable plus also. W&L pro-
vides exactly the atmosphere it pro-
mised to provide—partly because it
is all male, There are many coedu-
cational institutions, all of which,
presumably, provide a co-ed “at-
mosphere.” The fact that W&L does
not cannot be construed as an indict-
ment. Remember, this issue con-
cerns not the function of the Uni-
versity, but the manner in which it
goes about performing that function.
Does anyone imagine that instruc-
tion will improve in response to
coeducation?

Finally, it is the least weighty
argument of all which seems to en-
joy the greatest credence. The fact
that Washington and Lee does not
adhere to “national trends” is its
glory, not its shame, and if its
character as the oldest all male col-
lege in the nation is a difficult posi-
tion, then it seems to be maintain-
ing that difficult position with little
adverse effect. The notion that
“national trends” have some com-
pelling force on this University is

UP & COMING

Book Picking
Described As
Art & Science

BY BETTY MUNGER

The best thing which could hap-
pen, of course, would be that the
University turn over to the Book-
store that beautiful new gym, sauna
and all, Then, I think we might just
have enough space to stock all the
books we would like to carry. Until
that happy day there has to be some
kind of selection of what is available
for purchase,

How. are such choices made?
What determines which books are
carried and which books are avail-
able only through special orders?
After five years of operation a cer-
tain pattern has emerged at the
Bookstore. It is a combination of
wide reading of reviews (no book-
store. manager has much time for
the reading of many books—just re-
views!), a great deal of listening to
what people ask for and are inter-
ested in, plus a second sense—call
it radar—of what will be in demand
in the next few months. (Or no
sense at all, when you goof.)

There are professional tools which
are used all the time such as a
publication called Publisher's Week-
ly, a combination Bible, Koran and
Torah for booksellers, The maga-
zine looks ahead to what is com-
ing, gives short reviews and tips on
the books that are selling big all
over the country. It is strong on the
college market, Even then a man-
ager can miss something.

A year ago the publication of the
Greening of America got by me
and I had no idea of the book until
the first printing was all gone, so I
was way behind on stocking it. But
then, Random House, the publisher,
missed it too, for they only printed
5,000 copies on the first run. It
eventually went on to sell well over
100,000 copies in hardback. Here it
was the biggest hardback seller of
the Bookstore’s history (after we
finally got our hands on some) ex-
cept, naturally, Dr. Crenshaw’s Gen-
eral Lee’s College.

The primary purpose of the Book-
store is educational—exposure to
books, In that sense we teach. Yet
the students and others spend money
here voluntarily so there is no point
in stocking books they don’t want
(or should want?). Therefore we do
a great deal of listening and keep-
ing track of what sells. We must
never be out of such books as Her-
man Hesse’s novels, ee cummings’
poetry or Friedmann’s Capitalism
and Freedom, for instance.

1972 Mock Convention Report

1005 Student Delegates Attend

State Chairmen are looking for

prospective delegates to complete
their delegations.
Exactly 1005 delegates will fill

Doremus Gymnasium when the con-
vention is graveled to order on

May 5. Co-chairmen, Mike Camp-
ilongo and Tom Gillespie point out,
however, that the duties of delegates
begin long before the formal con-
vening in May.

“Not only do the delegations have
to have a firm knowledge of Demo-

cratic trends in their state, but also
they have to set up a network of
contacts,” says Campilongo.

The state chairmen have begun
the process already, But Gillespie
adds, “This is where the delegates
themselves come into play, so that
on the fifth or sixth ballot, each of
the delegations will have some idea
how they should vote.

The aim of the Mock Convention
is to predict the Democratic nomi-
nee for President. Both Co-chair-

 

Traditional Parade Stars
Cl ydesdales, Beauty Queen

BY BILL ANDREWS

The Mock Cenvention parade is
perhaps the most festive tradition
of the entire phenomenon. This
year the parade will begin at noon
on Friday, May 5.

In past years, the parade has
heen covered by state newspapers
und television stations as well as the
major wire services. We expect the
same co-operation with the media
this year

Among the ninty units anticipated
to march down Main street will be
the Budwieser “Clydesdales” and a
float bearing Miss Virginia. (Any
body know of an empty stable’...
for the horses, not Miss Virginia.)
Each of the state delegations is ¢x
pected to enter a unit in the parade

There will also be individual
floats representing the major con
tenders for the Democratic nomina
tion. In addition, the Mock Conven-
tion parade committee anticipates
several maching bands including
local high school bands, and the
‘Highty

lighties” of Virginia Tech

will invade V.M.1.’s home town.

The surrounding women's col-
leges are reportedly entering units
for this years parade. And, of
course, there will be clowns and
political figures. (Only discriminat-
ing parade views will be able to dis-
tinguish between them.)

The parade will begin at the Lex-
ington High School field. From
there the procession follows Main
Street until it intersects with Wash-
ington Street. The parade turns
down Washington and passes by the
reviewing stand near President
Huntley's house.

Cash prizes will be awarded to
the best entries. The judging will be
done by the assistant parade chat
men or their representatives.

The assistant parade chairmen
include Tommy VanAmburgh, Bill
Wallace, Paul Perkins, George
Wolfe, Craig Fines, John Folsom,
Bliss Hickey, Smitty Smith, Larry
Dunkle (custodian of the standard
bearing Donkey), and Don Cart
wright

men point out that the convention
does not necessarily reflect student
political views, but the nation as a
whole.

“Not only will the delegates par-
ticipate in the casting of votes on
the convention floor, but also in de-
signing and building floats for the
parade down Main Street,” says
Gillespie.

When queried as to who are elig-
ible to become delegates, Campilon-
go responded, “Of course all W&L
students and their wives, transfer
students, and we hope to find some
delegates from the surrounding
women’s colleges.

Why 1005? “I’m glad you asked
that,” replied Campilongo,” the
Mock Convention is actually a one
third scale reproduction of the na-
tional convention, so we divide the
number of delegates by a third and
come out with 1005.”

The delegations are not yet full
according to Gillespie, “The state
chairmen are trying to contact every
student to interest them in their
delegations.”

“Any student wishing more in-
formation or desiring to join a dele
gation can contact either Mike, ot
myself, or any of the state chair
men.”

Roundballers Defeat Tritons,
Wasps; Rhode Island U. Next

PALMER TRICE
nls the glory days have fin-
Ihe Generals finally put
together two good games in a row.
Wednesday night the Blue traveled
to Emory and Henry, where they
took on the home standing Wasps.
Ihe Wasps are always tenacious at
home, but the Washington and Lee
hoopers simply overwhelmed them
with good, basic basketball. Led by
Mike Daniel's career high of 37
points, the visiting Generals march-
ed to a 93-72 triumph, perhaps their
most impressive of the year.

[he Blue put forth an outstand
ing team effort. Aside from Daniel's
sterling performance, Paul McClure
put together his best game of the

ally come

season. McClure was good for 15
points, 12 rebounds, and six blocked
shots. He dominated the inside
game, intimidating the Wasp attack
Charlie Strain, who had 8 points
and 5S asists. “played his usual good
floor game, directing traffic on of
lense and defense.” Coach Canfield
also said that he got another good
game from Doug Clelan. Pre-game

strategy called for the Generals to
run from the moment of the open-
ine tip-off, and run they did. The

ington on Saturday night. They left
feeling like a fish out of water, com-
ing out on the short end of an 81-72
decision. The game was a momentu-

ous one. Mike Daniel took over
fitth place in the all-time list of
WAL scorers. His 27 points gave

him a total of 1,294, five more than
recent star Mike Neer. For the
first time, the Blue put together a
sound game on their home floor.
The margin could have been more,
as the Generals led by 17 at the
half, 42-25. With a nine point lead,
and 14:42 remaining in the game,
Coach Canfield displayed his confi-
dence in his bench by substituting
his first five with five from the
bench. Much like Dean Smith's Tar
Heels did in a_ similar position

against Virginia, the reserves held
their own. Florida Presbyterian was
unable to capitalize, and the Gen-

erals coasted for the rest of the ball
game

Lexington was the middle stop
for the Tritons on their northern
trip. They also took on Franklin and

Marshall College and St. Andrews
College. The Tritons had the mis
fortune of running into Skip Licht

fuss’ best game of the year. Skip hit
on 10 of 18 shots from the floor,
and grabbed 13 rebounds. His 24

Blue had a good floor game. Doug
Clelan highlighted it, as he con-
nected for 8 assists. The Generals
also outrebounded the visitors.

As a prelude to the Florida Pres-
byterian contest, the W&L frosh-
entertained Massanutten Military
Academy. With their 91-75 victory,
the freshmen boosted their record to
4-2. The team is an exceptional one.
Stu Nibley is an exceptional guard,
and his 21 point average could pro-
mise a needed outside scoring threat
for next year’s varsity. Guy Kerr
and Greg Croghan both are averag-
ing in double gures. In Saturday
night's game, Nibley had 20 points,

Daniel Fifth

In Scoring

Senior .captain. Mike. Daniel. has
been giving record-setting perfor-
mances lately, and the Washington
and Lee basketball Generals will
need more of them in a pair of
tough games coming up this week.

Last week Daniel scored 37 points
against Emory and Henry and 27
against Florida Presbyterian, both
Generals’ victories, to raise his sea-
son average to 23.6 points a game.
He also passed Mike Neer on the
all-time scoring list and now ranks
fifth with 1,294° career points,

At his present pace, Daniel could
easily rise to fourth on the all-time
list, just behind Mel Cartwright.
The all-time top scorers are Dom

Flora 2,310, Jay Handlan 2,002,
Cartwright 1,800, Lee Marshall
1,561, and Daniel 1,294 with 15

Marshall, who had only three.

Others. who have scored ovet
1,000 points in their careers are
Neer 1,289, and Jim Rich 1,005.
Both played just three years.

The Generals will need as many
of those record-pacing points as
they can get against opponents
Rhode- Island College and Baltimore
Loyola. W&L plays Rhode Island
at home Friday night (8 p.m.), fol-
lowed by the away game in Balti-
more Saturday night.

At last report, Rhode Island
boasted a 9-3 record, was averaging
over 100 points a game, and ranked
fourth nationally in shooting accur-
acy. Their big gun, 6-3 Ricky Wil-
son, is averaging over 26 points a
game and was a second team All-
American selection last year.

Baltimore Loyola, with a 7-6 rec-
ord, has everyone back from last
years Mason-Dixon Conference
championship team, and is always
tough at home.

To top off the hectic week, the
Generals get very little rest before
entertaining Bridgewater at home
next Monday night. That will be
three games in four nights.

The W&L freshmen, now 4-2 on
the year, will play 6 p.m. prelimi-
nary games prior to the Rhode Is-
land and Bridgewater games. The
opposition. will be the VMI Rats
Friday night, and the Bridgewater
frosh Monday night.

Washington and Lee University’s
swimming team faces a pair of for-
midable opponents this week, both
in Lexington.

Coach Bill Stearns swimmers
downed West Virginia Wesleyan,
62-49, last week, raising their sea-

son mark to 3-1, but face potent
Johns Hopkins and VMI this week.

In the medley relay, the team of
Harris, McCain, Lawlor, and How-
ard captured a first, as did Steve
Johnson in the 1000 freestyle and
Alan Corwith in the 200 freestyle
Freshman Wilt Brotherton captured
the 400 MI. while Senior Bert Meem
ran away with the 200 fly. Clark
and Barber swept 1-2 in both the
100 and SO freestyle, and John Law-
low took first in the 500 free. Harris

added a third in the 200 backstroke
as did Rick McCain in the 200
breaststroke. Freshman Jimmy
Baird took third in all diving events.
The evening coneluded with Catlin,
Clark. Brotherton and Johnson

relay.

Hopkins will be the opponent
Tuesday at 6 p.m. in WA&L’s new

LaRue’s Pressbox g,

Future of W&L Athletics

Last December I hired a swami
to look into his crystal ball to tell
me what was going to happen at (or
to) Washington and Lee, particular-
ly among the Athletic Department,
during the first six months of 1972.
This would have been printed earl-
ier, except my prognosticator could
not find my address, So here goes.

In January, Bowie Kuhn_ hires
Jim Bouton as pro baseball's Num-
ber One public relations man in or-
der to offset the effects of the Rozelle
Poll which claimed football to be
the nation’s favorite sport. Immedi-
ately, Bouton collaborates with his
assistant John Hughes in an inter-
view with W&L coach Joe Lyles,
the result of which is to vault the
National Pasttime into the fore-
front and Lyles into prominence as
baseball’s next Casey Stengle (watch
for this one sometime this week).

In February, W&L wrestling
coach John Piper, constantly kidded
about his boyish looks, goes on a
crash diet, loses forty pounds, and
enters himself as a W&L partici-
pant in the 180 pound class. But he
gets pinned anyway.

Among the first in. a series of
many shake-ups in the W&L Athletic
Department comes the March an-
nouncement by Athletic Director
William McHenry that Dick Miller
will replace Buck Leslie as head
football coach, Miller’s first move
as headcoach is to order fifty dozen
pairs of white socks. His second
move is to be late for his first pre-
season practice because there are
no clocks in the gym.

Meanwhile, in his spare time,
Murph has been working on a secret
formula which stimulates the rapid
growth of human hair. First to try
it is swim coach Bill Stearns, who,

 

 

with his new ornament, achieves
self-confidence and throws away his
copy of How To Pick Up Girls.

In Apirl, golf coach Cy Twombly
moves over to lead W&L’s formed
water-skiing team. Coach Norman
Lord replaces Twombly and im-
mediately starts to get his golfers in
shape by making them run up House
Mountain.

Also that month, trainer Tom
Jones is hired as the University
Physician, and Kelly Buell is recom-
mended as his replacement.

In May, the W&L Courses and
Degrees Committee approves P.E.
305, 306, and 307 (Skills in Base-
ball, Basketball, and Football Tri-
via) for the 1972-3 year, in response
to the First Annual W&L Sports
Trivia Contest, held in April when
everybody has nothing else to do.

Meanwhile, coach Dick Szlasa
becomes the backfield coach under
Miller and immediately installs the
Wishbone-T with Ed Kowal as the
option man, Dean Farrar is hired as
the lacrosse coach .

one which must be resisted at all
cost,

None of the justifications thus far
extended can even overcome the de-
sirability of our present and tra-
ditional position, much less cope
with the dangers—expansion, loss of
revenue, and potential damage to
the athletic and fraternity situation
among them—which  coeducation
promises, There simply is no case.

Lee: A Non-Person?
lo the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

It was commendable of The Ring-
tum Phi to have remembered the
birthday and contributions of a liv-
ing member of the Washington and
Lee family. It is with some regret,
however, that it must be noted that
the birthday of a spiritual contribu-
tor to the heritage of our university
was forgotten. Has R. E. Lee be-
come a non-person?

Mrs. Munger Outlines:
How Books Are Chosen

For The W@L Bookstore

(Continued from page 2)

We watch special orders care-
fully and when there have been two
or three for a particular book we
get it for the shelves. The sudden
flash of a best seller like Love Story
keeps us trying to guess how long it
will last and should we order 20 or
50 copies more? After selling 125
copies in 3 months we have not
sold a single copy of Love Story
since July. So it goes, as Vonnegut
says in Slaughter House Five.

It is inevitable that a Bookstore
takes on to some extent the Char-
acter and interests of the book buy-
er. This must be guarded against but
can also be used. The range of en-
thusiasms of the person who makes
the decisions can expand horizons,
and dimensions to a student's inter-
ests and even a light touch at times.
However, the radar of the manager
has to be finely tuned or we find
ourselves way off the main track.
The Bookstore stock must be a bal-
anced one and we welcome people
into the act.

Each year seems to be different,
This year the range of concerns is
more diffuse, less concentrated and
activist, And yet we have never been
as challenged by the variety of sub-
jects which people are delving into.
The diversity of curiosity keeps us
jumping—with, of course, more
chances for not making the right
selections. Unhappiness is not hav-
ing a book that is asked for or be-
ing scared when the prices go up.
One thing for sure, tomorrow won't
be like yesterday, and today in the
Bookstore is never dull.

ally changed over the years: “If
there is something radically differ-
ent in this generation that would
make the Honor System inapplic-
able now or ineffective now, what
is it that has changed? | think the
burden of evidence then would have
to be on the students themselves
who want the changes to come.”

It is the hope of the study group
that in the course of its examina-
tion of the Honor System it will
gather as many different opinions
and observations as possible. The
aim is to be objective, and to arrive
at valid conclusions from honest in-
vestigation. The two men interview-
ed this week certainly have contri-
buted to the study; and it is also
hoped that the study will encompass
the ideas of the students of whom
Dr. Leyburn spoke, those “who
want the changes to come.” The re-
sults of these interviews will con-
tinue to be reported (or at least
sketched) weekly in the Ring-tum

clusions will be reached remains, of
course, to be seen.

tor. “This is what we're trying to
work for in this production.”

Excerpts from Luther were staged
last October at R. E. Lee Memorial
Episcopal Church. Mr. Kahn said
the abbreviated version emphasized
Luther's preaching but did not deal
sufficiently with Martin Luther as a
human being. The conflict between
Luther and his father also was not
dealt with.

Luther is only one of several
plays by John Osborne. The English
playwright is perhaps best known
for Leok Back in Anger, written in
1957. His other plays include Hotel

Volunteers For Programs

The University Federation is still alive and it needs volunteers for its

activities,

There are still kids in town who need a “Big Brother” or “Big Sister”
to whom they can look up to and respect not only as an older person but
also as a friend. Volunteers are needed for this program.

Tutors are needed at a school in Lexington called Central School.

Volunteers are needed to go to Chatham Nursing Home to visit with the
old folks and hopefully brighten their day.

Students are needed at Western State Mental Hospital in Staunton to
help the patients out, That place is like a jail to some people.

Students are needed to help the handicapped children of Rockbridge
County overcome their psychological handicaps.

The University Federation needs volunteers.

Congressman Robinson Presents
Legislative Action Program

BY PAUL LANCASTER

Congressman J. Kenneth Robin-
son, representing the seevnth dis-
trict of Virginia, emphasized in a
speech here last Thursday that the
future military budget of America
will be based on “what we will need
for the safety of the country, and
what it will cost.”

The congressman, brought here
by the College Republicans, cited
three reasons for an increase in mili-
tary spending this year—‘inflation
.. . proliferation of tensions in the
world .. . and the limited hopes” of
the people of the world in general.

Robinson, serving his first term in
the House of Representatives, noted
a myriad of problems limiting the
cutback of defense spending. Among
these were the inadequacies of our
present arsenal, the need for devel-
opment of the greatest possible sec-
urity system with the smallest
amount of manpower, and the at-
tempt to draw high quality per-

sonnel into the military with high

He stated that the Navy would
get the most consideration this year
in the budget. The representative
said we must increase our weapons
technology in the Navy to “prevent
the Indian Ocean from becoming a
Russian lake this fall,”

Robinson summed up his discus-
sion of the military budget by de-
claring that “defense spending is
going to get a close look by Con-
gress this year.”

The Congressman then presented
a “laundry list of concerns” coming
up before Congress this year be-
fore concluding his talk with a brief
question-an-answer period. Among
the items on his list:

—an increase in social security bene-
fits of about five percent.
—welfare reform, at least “hope-
fully . . . it’s presently a mess, a
total mess.” Included with this would
be a possible guaranteed annual
wage.

— increased expansion of water pol-
lution control,

—consideration for an increased
minimum wage.
tightened enforcement against

racial discrimination in hiring.
——consumer legislation, particularly
to enforce product warranties,
—consideration on a national health
insurance program.

——a look at reorganizing the execu-
tive branch of the government.

Leyburn Cited
At Ceremony

Dr. James G. Leyburn, Professor
of Sociology, who will retire after
the current academic year, was
honored in a brief ceremony during
the opening of an African art ex-
hibition on Thursday afternoon in
the Bookstore.

President Robert E, R. Huntley
spoke shortly to express his gratitude
for the contributions made by Ley-
burn to the life of the school and
the inspiration he provided to count-
less numbers of students. During
Leyburn’s second year at WAL.
Huntley had been enrolled in one
of his courses, so he said he spoke
with the experience of a student
also,

Earlier Mr. James E. Loesel, In
siructor in Politics had given a
brief background description of the
various examples of sculpture,
woodwork, painting, and clothwork.
The majority of art objects came
from East African nations. Dr, Ley-
burn then gave a short speech on

E.C. Supports Coeducation

By JOHN F. ZINK

The Executive Committee, meet-
ing Monday night, heard arguments
by committee members and specta-
tors for and against the proposal
that Washington and Lee go co-
educational in the future. After the
various opinions were voiced on the
subject, a vote was taken endorsing
coeducation, nine to three,

Steve Robinson, President of the
Student Body, stated that he was
in favor of the move towards co-
education. Robinson said that
coeducation is essential to main-
tain the high quality of education
at Washington and Lee. One repre-
sentative raised the question of
whether or not it was proper for
the Executive Committee to make
a statement concerning the subject
of coeducation before the matter
comes up before the entire student
body in the form of a referendum
during the spring.

Robinson then asked for remarks
from the audience. One student said
that the objection raised against co-
education on the basis that it would
disrupt the course structure was un-
founded. He pointed out that the
courses are in a constant state of
change regardless of coeds or not.
He also voiced the opinion that a
move towards coeducation would

improve the financial position of
the university by making it a more
attractive recipient of government
and private donations.

Objections to coeducation were
raised by Mike Brittin, sophomore
representative. Brittin§ stated that
there were no immediate plans for
expansion of the campus facilities.
He stated that the increase in stu-
dents would add too many students
to an already over-extended student
body. Other objections were that the
admission of women would hurt the
science courses, make the Honor
Code unenforceable, cause the
alumni to lose their identity with
Washington and Lee, and would
cause WAL to lose an aspect of its
uniqueness,

Representative John McCarthy
stated that the Executive Commit-
tee’s function was not to lay out a
plan for coeducation, He = said
“There are many ways to impliment
the coeducational idea.” McCarthy
also stated, “The point now is to
come out with a statement; to get
the student body behind this issue
is the only way to get it going.”

Glenn Azuma, agreeing with Mc-
Carthy, said, “The Executive Com-
mittee must lead the students,”

Rick Gray. Executive Committee
Secretary, stated that the E.C.

should act as an educational body;
the student body should know all
of the facts and figures.

Lock Handley, Senior Law Rep-
resentative, said, “We should dis-
cuess it (coeducation) in public in
order to be fair to those who hold
the minority opinion.”

Several members of the audience
voiced support for coeducation. One
student said that, “We are limiting
ourselves as a university.” He stat-
ed that by going coeducational, the
education we receive will be com-
plete. Another student stated that
as it stands now, the supposition
is that the male/female relation-
ship is rather unimportant. He
continued, “You (Executive Com-
mittee) do have powers of sug-
gestion to the faculty and student
body. This is a matter which re-
quires your attention.”

John McCarthy, urging a formal
statement, said “We should make
it an important issue. We should
either say that we are for it, or
that we are against it.” With that
statement, Glenn Azuma, Vice-
President of the Executive Com-
mittee, made the motion that the
Executive Committee endorse the
concept of coeducation at Washing-
ton and Lee. Before the vote could
be taken, however, Lock Handley

Stewart Udall Opens ‘Contact’ Forum

By PAUL LANCASTER

Stewart Udall. former Secreta*y
of the Interior with the Kenned
and Johnson administration, kicked
off this year’s “Contact” program
last evening by “unloading (his)
environmental hay” in a talk on
ecology.

Udall opened with excerpts from
his latest article, “Robert Frost,

Kennedy, and Khrusechev: A Memoir
of Poetry and Power,” in which he
presented a brief study of the three
men in relation to one another. The
speaker expressed hopes for the
article to be published by a na-

28 Students Chosen

tional magazine in the near future.

Udall then turned to ecology,
basing his speech on quotations
from two eminent scientists: Dr.
Albert Schweitzer—“Man lacks the
capacity to foresee and forestall...
he will destroy the earth.” and
Loren Eiseley—“The Terror of our
age in man’s conception of himself.”

Udall then noted “Mankind’s last
broad and basic change occurred at
the Rennaissance. We've come to
the climax of that period in the
the vast, futuristic thinking of “pro-
past few years.” He stated that
ductivity weapons and

space missions” just a decade ago
has been seriously questioned.
People “thought growth was a good
quantitative yardstick.”

He specified Rachel Carson and
thing and measured (progress) by
her book, “Silent Spring.” as the
beginnings of the change of thought
we afe now experiencing. The en-
vironmental issue grew and de-
veloped until the point where we
are finally realizing that “the doubl-
ing and re-doubling of everything
could not continue. The ecosystem
will not tolerate for all the people
of this planet, which increased in

year, their expectations” of a con-
stantly improving standard of liv-
ing.

“Growth at this point is incom-
patible with the present environ-
mental quality.” Udall continued.
We've begun “to pay attention to
the life scientists—the life support
system of the planet is frail . .
the topsoil is thin . the atmo-
sphere is thin . . . and the life
zone of the oceans is just a few
feet deep.

“We (the United States) are the
house on the hill calling down.”
he stated, citing that we are but
six percent of the population of the
world while at the same time we
are utilizing 35 per cent of the
world resources. But Udall was
optimistic. “This (present environ-
mental concern) could be, may very
well be, a period of historic change.
and what the ecosystem will ab-
We have to recognize our limits
sorb. There must be a change of
man's concept in himself.”

Udall hinted that we are learn-
ing from our mistakes. “The great-
est contribution of the space pro-
gram was a look at our-
selves .. . and that the solar system
is dead pretty conclusively. Earth
is where we'd better concentrate
our efforts.”

The former Cabinet member
turned to the population problem

in the United States, as it “is

 

handball must adhere to the Athletic Department's new rules,

relaied to life and the quality of

life. We are producing one-half of
the pollution on this planet. The
feeling is growing that if we want
to save the environment, we've got
to move in a direction of stabiliz-
ing our population. This means
enormous changes in the lives of
our young people.

“For the first time in history,
the growth of a city or a nation
is not particularly good. For the
first time in our history, the birth
of a child is more tragedy than
blessing. There are ramifications in-
volved that we've only begun to
talk about.”

Udall concluded by proclaiming
that today's youth “is the generation
that must begin (to attack the prob-
lem) before the century is out,”
Their great task involves “being
good earthlings, assuming the moral
responsibilities of the future, and
rediscovering ourselves, humanity.
an dthe world itself.”

asked if he could give his reason
for an affirmative vote. Handley
said, “Our society is changing, one
change is in the way men and
women look at each other; an all
male school does not fit into this
change.” Handley continued, “I
would rather see this school fall
on its face going in the right di-
rection, than for it to continue as
a type of ‘game preserve’ for male
chauvinism. We are avoiding our
responsibility if we do not realize
the trend today.”

President Robinson then called
for a vote on the Azuma motion;
the motion carried in favor of co-
education nine to three. Robinson
also stated that at next week’s meet-
ing there would be a similar dis-
cussion on the concept of re-institut-
ing required English courses.

dance format and the sale of beer at
the dance.

Leading off the February 12
activities will be the University
Cocktail party at the Buffalo Creek
Pavilion. Grain will once again be
served and continuous music will
be provided by two bands, but the
length of this year’s party has been
doubled to four hours, from 2 p.m.
to 6 p.m. It's even expected that
the grain will last that long.

Dance Board officials are hoping
that there will still be enough people
standing after the cocktail party to
come to Sha-Na-Na’'s concert-dance
in Evans Dining Hall that evening.
Admission will be restricted to those
wearing 1950's style outfits or
formal clothes, The former is ex-
pected to prevail along with greas-
ed hair. The dance will begin at
9 p.m. and last until | p.m. The
Embers will start the music and
will be followed by Sha-Na-Na
sometime after 11 p.m,

In addition to the music and
costumes, the dance will feature
some thirty kegs of draft beer to
be sold at a nominal price. Be-
cause the beer will be sold under
ARA’s liquor license, students will
not be allowed to bring liquor into
the dance. Anyone caught doing so
will be either relieved of their bottle
or ejected from the dance with or
without their bottle. Tickets may
be purchased either in the Co-op
or at the door for $5 per person.

| OUTLOOK and REVIEW

Washington and Lee has spent several thousand dollars
over the last three years to improve the university parking
situation. Despite the school's efforts, the parking problem is
clearly worse than three years ago. Here is a brief review of
what has happened.

Four parking lots have been constructed, One is at the
foot of the Colonnade across Jefferson Street from the Phi
Kappa Sigma house. This lot is packed to its limits. Any late
evening you would discover that the small lot is far from
empty. Red Square residents and apartment tenants in the
vicinity merely leave their vehicles there almost around the
clock for days.

The second new lot is over one half mile from the univer-
sity academic buildings. Deserted is the best deseription of
this gravel blunder. Nobody uses the lot except for intercol-
legiate and intramural games on the Upper Field. Well, al-
most; it seems that some students drive up there to consume
alcohol or to try to enchant their dates, or a combination
thereof, Aside from that, who would dare leave his automobile
in the boondocks completely unprotected ?

Third on the list of new parking facilities is the area adja-
cent to the Library and Old Dorms, This region teems with
four-wheeled monsters from 7:30 a.m. until 11:00 p.m, Dorm
Counselors and their charges tend to have an established
monopoly in this region.

Finally, a fourth parking area is located below Doremus
Gymnasium near Route 60. The lot is not well used, and if
used, entails a grand uphill trek in order to reach the campus.

Four new or improved parking areas exist. So what is the
problem ?

The answer to this question is complex. Coupled with the
appearance of these parking spots was the dramatic disappear-
ance of an almost unlimited parking haven, That haven was
the expansive acreage behind old Doremus Gymnasium, With
construction of the new gym this refuge was gobbled by the
new building. Also as a result of the construction, workers
had to park in places that students, faculty members and ad-
ministrators might have put to good use.

Another answer is that the number of students operating
cars has zoomed, Increased enrollment has meant more
vehicles. In addition the faculty approved two resolutions in
recent years that aggravated the crisis. The first was permit-
ting scholarship students to operate cars. The second was al-
lowing freshmen to also operate cars within Rockbridge
County. These limits had effectively held the automobile
population down, Freshmen, who must live on-campus, ob-
viously wish to have their vehicles close by .The result is that
the few parking places along Washington Street around the
Student Union are jammed with freshmen cars.

If the above situation was not miserable enough, the City
of Lexington compounded the quandary, “NO PARKING”
signs popped up on Washington Street opposite the Dutch
Inn. Then meters installed on Lee Avenue between
Washington Street and Preston Street,

Sounds bad? It will get worse. The area immediately in
front of Doremus will soon be converted into a plaza-type
space. So, kiss those few spaces goodbye.

With a majority of W&L students living off-campus, what
can they do? Many live in the country and must drive to and

were

from classes, as well as extracurricular activities. There often
is just nowhere to squeeze in a car near the campus, These
souls have few options but to park illegally and run the risks
of acquiring a ticket.

Last year W&L did not distribute parking stickers to men
who lived within a half mile of the university, This regula-
tion has faded away. Perhaps, it should be reincarnated.
However, it would simply constitute. a short-run, stopgap
solution.

The vital problem is this:
greatly outdistancing any growth in parking facilities. Stu
dents are spending too much time hunting for crevices for

the car population growth is

their cars. Plus, the faculty is increasing in numbers, yet its
parking domain remains constant in size, With the new law
school on the drawing boards, you can bet more student
lawyers soon will be attending W&L. More students mean
more cars. Already visitors and prospective students are un
able to even get near W&L, If over $3,000,000 can be coughed
up for a gym, why cannot just a bit more be produced so that
people can park their automobiles within a sane distance of
this institution ?

Washington and Lee.

DAVID ROGER MUNSICK, JR.

Washington and Lee's students
are, in general, a diverse group.
There are few overriding generali-
zations that unite all of them. It
is perhaps fitting, then, that The
Ring-tum Phi series on aspects of
the University begins with one of
these seldom-found common  de-
nominators, Regardless of their cur-
rent academic standing, their social
mores, their political views, each
of Washington and Lee’s undergrad-
uates passed at one time through
the school’s admissions process.

Admissions at Washington and
Lee, as at other similar schools, is
a time-consuming, expensive, often
subjective phenomenon, one that
shapes the character of a student
body, and yet one that is prey to
national trends that extend far be-
yond the college campus.

According to James D. Farrar,
Director of Admissions, Washington

mittee is occupied by decisions on
borderline candidates, of whom
many may be qualified, but of
whom, due to size limitations, only
a relatively small number can be
selected,

Service on the committee is usu-
ally undertaken in three year terms.
Last year, student representation on
the committee on questions of over-
all policy, though not questions on
specific applications, was initiated
for the first time. Greg Wilson °72,
and Griff Steel ‘73 are this year’s
student representatives.

Successful applicants to the Uni-
versity will be notified on or about
March 25. They need not, how-
ever, reply until May 1. Unsuccess-
ful applicants receive word from
Washington and Lee by April 1. It
is during the spring period that the
rate of confirmations from those
accepted is watched carefully. A
predetermined number, (it will be
roughly 350 for the class that will
enter this September) of freshmen
has been established, and it must
be discerned if, to achieve that
figure, more acceptances should be
issued to men placed on the wait-

 

 

Director of Admissions, James D. Farrar, talks about the selection process,

and Lee may spend more than a
year in some form of contact with
a prospective applicant; a period
ranging from sometime during the
candidate's junior year in high
school until notification of accept
ance of rejection in the spring of
the senior year

Initial correspondence, then, for
individuals seeking to come to
Washington and Lee as freshmen in
the fall of 1973, will probably
begin next month. High school
juniors inquiring about the Univer
sity will receive return letters and
publications from the Admissions
Office. Files will be opened. Next
September, application forms will
be mailed to all those who have
expressed interest, By November |
completed applications are due from
those seeking an Early Decision

(Such applicants agree to atiend
Washingion and Lee if accepted.)
The Admissions Committee renders

a decision on these applicants by
November 15, and confirmation of

aceepiance from successful appli
cants is due by December |
(Last fall, seventy men, an all

time record, applied to Washington

and Lee under this program. Fifty
five of these candidates were ac
cepted.)

The greater bulk of WAL candi

dates, those applying under the

normal admissions procedure, must
submit their papers, (and the $10
applications fee) by February 15

lt is roughly at this time of the year

selection of Washington and Lee
by more than an anticipated num-
ber of those accepted, can lead to
overcrowding and large class sizes,
(This was the case with the class
that entered the University in the
fall of 1970)

Thirteen men make up the ad-
missions committee, and it is clear
that each possesses his own ideas
about what factors are characteristic
of the best candidate for Wash-
ington and Lee. Some certain de-
nominators are required of all W&l

applicants, All must take the
Scholastic Aptitude Tests in the
verbal and quantitative fields, as

well as the English Composition
Test and at least two other Achieve-
ment Tests of their own choice
Also, while the varying qualities of
different secondary schools are
taken into consideration, all appli-
cants are required to take a certain
series of courses, made up of six
teen college preparatory units, In
addition these include
four units of English, three of
math, two in a foreign language,
and at one in a laboratory

than half of Washington and Lee's
applicants usually visit the campus

At times one vexing problem,
and one of which both high school
college counselors and college ad-
missions officials are apparently
keenly aware, is the role of extra-
curricular activity in a candidate’s
consideration. Washington and Lee,
for the most part, appears to be
reluctant to accept men who, in
Dean Farrar’s words, “have been
unwilling to give of themselves and
contribute to their school.” At the
other extreme, the admissions com-
mittee must be on guard against
“professional extra-curriculars,” men
whose meticulously cited records
list a wide variety of highly super-
ficial endeavors,

The solution, or at least, the at-
tempted solution to this problem,
on the part of Washington and Lee,
is to seek the academically qualified
applicant, who has demonstrated an
in-depth interest in a relatively small
number of activities, a man who
shows some promise of continuing
such activities in colleges. In the

Washington and Lee admissions
situation, one’s participation — in
athletics is evaluated in a manner

similar to other activities, (drama,
debate, publications, music, art, etc.)
but Dean Farrar is quick to point
out that visits of coaches to dif-
ferent areas has been a real asset
in bringing Washington and Lee to

the attention of outstanding  stu-
dents, athletes and non-athletes
alike.

The role of alumni is yet another
factor to be considered in an indi-
vidual’s application. Consistently
placing high among initial contacts
for secondary school applicants
with Washington and Lee is the
reputation of alumni. Frequently,
graduates of the University submit
recommendations in behalf of candi-
dates. In recent years, more organiz-
ed activity in behalf of admissions
has been organized in five areas;
Atlanta, Chicago, the Tri-city reg-
ion in North Carolina, Philadelphia,
and Cleveland. Each area has an
alumni chairman who heads a group
of from eight to ten men in the
respective city. Under the program,
which is largely coordinated by
Dean William Schildt from Wash-
ington and Lee, the groups seek to
attract outstanding high school stu-
dents for Washington and Lee, to
interview personally as many area
applicants as possible, and to at-
tempt to contact the successful
applicants in order to urge them to
choose Washington and Lee. Balti-
more is now the sixth city involved
in this program,

A further influence of alumni
comes on the question of the admis-
sion of the sons of graduates called
“among the most sensitive of all
areas” by Dean Farrar. Sons of
Washington and Lee alumni are not
automatically accepted by the Uni-
versity, but they do receive special
considerations, Many general appli-
cants who are rejected by WAL are
in fact qualified to do the work in-
volved; they fail to be accepted
only because others, for a variety
of reasons, are considered to be
more qualified, Alumni sons, how-
ever, do not face this situation. They
are judged only on their own
ability to perform successfully at
Washington and Lee, If it is felt
that they can, they are accepted;
if not, they are rejected. They are
not confronted by what can be a
very intense general competition for
places in a WAL freshman class.

Last year, 85 alumni sons sought
admission to Washington and Lee
and 64, roughly 75% were accepted
This is in contrast to an acceptance
figure of about 64% for all other
applicants, The highest alumni son
acceptance ratio was 76% in 1967

admissions is a situation of
individuals and procedures, In the
final analysis, however, the picture
becomes one of cold hard figures
In order to fill the aforementioned
$80 spots in a freshman class, Wash-
ington and Lee generally must ac

Washington and Lee
has battled successfully to
trend. Since dropping to

for many small colleges), Wash-
ington and Lee has seen its applica-
tions rise each year, back up to
last year’s figure of 1260. Applica-
tions for this year, are, at this
writing running 5% ahead of last
year’s pace (1107 as compared to
1054 a year ago). Dean Farrar
attributes this continuing small rise
to two factors, the University’s
strong reputation in many areas of
academic life and Washington and
Lee’s long-standing desire to be a
national institution. (Although 20%
of W&L students come from Vir-
ginia, the school also draws heavily
from such areas as Texas, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and
Ohio.)

Nonetheless, Washington and Lee
has felt the financial trends domi-
nant in the nation, Confronted with
the choice of sacrificing to attend
Washington and Lee, or living easily
at a larger, less expensive school,
an individual of moderate resources
will often choose the latter al-
ternative if he receives two ac-
ceptances. Worse yet, he may not
apply to Washington and Lee at
all, and the pool of applicants is
thus reduced. The loss of such stu-
dents, in both ways, is reflected in
admission statistics, 66% of all ap-
plicants had to be accepted to fill an
eventual enrollment of 356 a year
ago. While the average W&L fresh-
man continues to be ranked in the
top 19% of his secondary school
class, average SAT scrores stood at
575 (verbal) and 615 (math), a very
slight rise from the year before.

Even more striking is the effect
of the financial plight on the whole
question of financial aid. Up to
1969, every successful applicant who
demonstrated the need was offered
the necessary assistance to attend
W&L. But this past year, due to
the fiscal situation, that number
shrank to 140 of 176 such appli-
cants, (Still a high figure for a
liberal arts college of this size.)
But students that Washington and
Lee wanted; individuals who may
well have wanted Washington and
Lee, went elsewhere as a result.

The situation is also made ap
parent in an examination of applica-
tions from underprivileged students.
In 1970, 38 such applications were
received, 26 were admitted, and
17 enrolled. Last year, there were
34 applications, 19 were offered
acceptance, but only 6 enrolled, in
part at least, because of the fi-
nancial aid situation,

It is difficult then to evaluate the
overall state of admissions at Wash-
ington and Lee. No one questions
that improvement is desired; few
can fail to see that some improve-
ment is being made on what is
already a solid foundation, Financial
limitations are indeed regrettable,
but they are part of a national
situation, one that Washington and
Lee certainly cannot solve by it
self, one that it has still resisted
through outstanding personnel and

a continuing sense of institutional
purpose, The great coeducation
question that confronts the Uni

versity certainly would have effects
on admissions, but there appear to
be highly varied opinions on how
much such a move would lend to
the academic excellence of WAI
applicants,

There is, however, one resource
that can be employed immediately
to aid the overall admissions picture;
one way that the present makeup
of the school can improve that pool
of applicants, and can influence
more of those who have been ac
cepted here to make Washington
and Lee their school, This is through
the use of Washington and Lee's
students, One such program already
exists of course; the Student Re

More Letters On Coeducation

Group Urges Change

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

| composed this letter with a
zest, an assurance, and a hope that
has been vacant from my life here
in Lexington. Until recently, it was
assumed by (most) students that
W&L was, structurely, something
that was just lived with. With the
birth of an active interest in co-
education, the students may have
awakened from a long slumber.
Apathy is slowly being put off; put
away. W&L is again alive.

The group | am representing is
not only offering a way of con-
tinuing this rarity of commitment,
it is offering a tremendous transi-
tion for W&L living. It is offering
(hopefully) a sexually and racially
more equal place to live. It is hop-
ing to alter the barriers that now
forbid girls from attending this
school,

As a group we are actively press-
ing for this change. We were at the
E.C, meeting this past Monday, we
will be at the next U.C. meeting
on coeducation, and we have met
(hopefully by the time you read
this) with President Huntley. We
were present when the U.C, decided
to put a coeducation referendum on
the upcoming election ballots.

We (THE STUDENTS FOR CO-
EDUCATION) are seeking to make
Washington and Lee a better school
and a better place to live. When I
say this, ideas of equality and fair-
ness, and of a healthy, normal life

The President's proposed eight-
point peace plan may well have
been an effective ploy to quiet the
dovish opposition to the Vietnam
War, yet how effective will it be in
the settlement of the conflagration
in Southeast Asia? May the Presi-
dent not quite possibly have sacri-
ficed the lives and effort of the
American nation in return for short-
term political gain?

The most disquieting aspect of
the peace plan is the possibility of
a coalition government. Coalition
governments have been tried in
many areas of the world since
World War Il, yet they have been
notoriously unstable and have, with
the exception of Austria, fallen
through internal subversion to the
Communists.

Due to the divided loyalties of
Communist agents operating in such
a political establishment, the coali-
tion government eventually becomes
a system in which one portion of
the structure operates for the good
of the state while another portion
operates for the advancement of
one political party; with the out-
side resources the Communists are
able to call on, at the proper time
a coup d'etat becomes a certain
success for them, Considering the
extremely unstable situation in Viet-
nam, a coalition government would
be the worst possible means of re-
storing peace, prosperity, and indi-
vidual liberty to this nation,

Students for Coeducation

Consider Alumnae Gifts

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Coeducation, which promises to
be an issue for the next few years,
should be looked at rationally in-
stead of emotionally, In other words,
despite the fact that it would be
very nice to have girls around, the
advantages of coeducation must
outweigh the disadvantages in order
to justify such sweeping change in
this institution,

The pro-coed arguments do not
convince me that the advantages
outweigh the drawbacks of coedu-
cation for several reasons.

First, Washington and Lee offers
a choice that fewer and fewer col-
leges are offering—the choice to at-
tend an all-male school. Probably
becattse WAL offers this option, ap-
plications to W&L were up last year
while many other schools suffered a
decrease in applications,

Somehow, it is comforting to
know that students come here pri-
marily to get an education, not to
look for a marriage partner or use

clause. Victorious nations do not
pay reparations to defeated op-
ponents; while a political compro-
mise may well present a settlement
in Vietnam, complete American sur-
render appears slightly out of line
with the utter failure of the Com-
munists to win a military victory.
We should be in a strong bargain-
ing position at the peace talks, yet
our proposals have all the familiar
stamp of defeat,

We did not send in the Marines
so the Communists would have
prisoners to treat as hostages.
Rather, we entered the Vietnam con-
flict with vague yet tangible goals;
if we still have these same goals,
then this is not the time for col-
lapse, while, if we have changed
our goals, then a complete revision
of our Vietnam policy is in order.
It is not compatible with our policies
to the present in Vietnam for us
to seriously propose such a contro-
dictory and discordant plan as the
President has suggested.

It appears that the Communist
forces will not accept this program.
This rejection would be a definite
mistake on their part, for it is
difficult to envision another plan
so tractable to their interests while
failing so miserably to safeguard
those goals that so many Americans
have given so much to achieve.

Much concern and upheaval has

that not the Whites but the Blacks

The Supreme Court’s decision to
alleviate the dual school system is
now running into a major conflict
with Mr, Nixon's Southern Strategy.
Mr. Nixon and his Administration
continue to sweet talk us mis-led
Southerners with a piece of pepper-
mint candy in the form of a “hands
off policy” toward busing. This at-
titude of the Administration is
reminiscent of the former Republi-
can President Hayes who withdrew
federal troops from the south, gas-
sing the enforcement of federal laws
to protect the Black minority.
Whereas The Department of Health,
Education and Welfare withhold
funds from some Southern districts,
it only passes the funds to a more
reluctant Justice Department who
distributes it to others who promise
they will comply with the law.

When Elliot Richardson announc-
ed that all but 76 of the South's
2,700 school districts were integrat-
ed, he used a criteria for desegrega-
tion which is very deceiving. His
remarks that 90.5 per cent of
Blacks and Whites in the south at-
tend schools in “unitary” systems
are also deceiving. He uses the
terms desegregation and unitary in

a functional manner. Its task is to
function in such a way with figures
and numbers and not cold facts,
The way the Administration is
counting students is the same way
a conductor would count the train
car and not the passengers. It is
possible that the train cars could be
mixed—even if only three out of
eighty passengers in only two of
the 100 cars were Black. If one
looks at the quantitative aspects of
HEW's figures and the real figures
he will find a great flaw. Must we
remind the Administration that the
integration movement must not be
weighed on qualitative aspects only
but also on quantitative aspects.

When the General Accounting
Office (an investigating arm of Con-
gress) charged that $75 million in
emergency funds appropriated to
facilitate integration had been mis-
used, the Administration's desire to

buy Southern votes was seen. Jack-
son, Mississippi was allocated $.3
million for desegregation before it
filed it’s application for funds. It
was also discovered that Talladega
County, Ala. received $168,247
after telling HEW that there was
no discrimination against Black
teachers. The Administration always
investigates; why did not they in-
vestigate that lie? Since President
Nixon had personally ordered “to
get that money out there,” maybe.

HEW's goal was to do just that
with any means possible. Some of
these desegregation projects follow
racist overtones—that Blacks have
special defects in behavioral pat-
terns, that Blacks are best suited for
menial jobs and most have very
poor hygiene. Some of the projects
have very little to do with de-
segregation and are very irrelevant
to bringing the two races together.
Instead of making harmony these
projects sometimes make a conflict
a derivative,

In the long run some of these
funds may help the South resist
desegregation. (The Southern leaders
should tell the Administration to go
and play politics in the North).
Whites think that they are being
affected by busing and desegrega-
tion. | ask them this question, “What
schools are being closed—Blacks’ or
Whites’?” Yes, Black schools are
transformed into vocational centers,
warehouses and administration
buildings. Then the white schools
are enlarged to accomodate the in-
coming Blacks. The Blacks are the
ones who have been taking long
bus rides for years, The Blacks are
the ones who have to see the only
landmark in town which they can

How does two-platoon baseball
grab you? Rather than one set of
nine ballplayers, why not use eigh-
teen? In the field your pitchers and
eight others are your best de-
fensive players; at bat, you em-
ploy the nine best hitters. Crazy,
huh? Yes, but in a time when base-
ball is gradually losing its hold on
the American public, such an in-
innovation would do the game more
than a litthe good, And if baseball
Coach Joe Lyles has his way, W&L
may play a couple of games to
practice the idea.

Oh, it’s been tried in the past,
but without success, largely because
the public was enthralled with the
old style. But now, people are los-
ing interest in baseball and are
turning to other sports such as
football and basketball. Why that
is has been enough to command a

sociological study; but from: my way
of thinking, twoplatoon baseball
may do more than provide a design
to spur lagging interest. More im-
portantly, it would create an op-
portunity for more people to play.
Baseball suffers from a one-way
substitution rule; once a player is
taken out, he cannot return. Thus
a coach is often reluctant to take
a starter out, for fear that he may

by replacing him with a_ second
string «perfermer. None of these
other sports face this problem. Stu-
dents going out for the team, par-
ticularly freshmen and sophomores,
see only a carer of bench warming,
and soon decide to bag it. This is
particularly true at the larger uni-
versities but is equally adaptable to
smaller institutions like W&L.

Secondly, baseball is a sport
which does not rely as heavily on
specialization as other sports. In
football, a flanker must be fast and
able to catch a pass, and a tackle
must be able to move someout out.
But in baseball, a player must be
able to hit, run, throw, and field
with equal ability or he is on the
bench,

Sure, you can change the -sub-
stitution rule, but that would mean
playing time for only a few more
participants. With an eighteen man

starting line-up, more might get to
play. And after all, that’s what the
game is all about. A close look at
the W&L student body would reveal
that there are a number of potential
athletes who have been discouraged
by the prospect of insufficient play-
ing time.

So thinks Coach Joe, who is cur
rently looking for a team or two

Generals Defeat Hopkins, Rhode Island, Bridgewater;
Emory & Henry Here Saturday

Record Now 10-5;

By PALMER TRICE

Besides winning three of four
games last week, Coach Canfield
learned something about scheduling.
You don’t play four games in a
week, It is too hard on your ball
players. That was the excuse for
the solitary W&L loss. “We just
ran out of gas,” said General Hoop
Coach Verne Canfield. “Loyola had
a good ball club.”

Last Tuesday night, the Generals
started off their big week, at home,
with Johns Hopkins. The visitors
had won but one game before their
appearance at Doremus, The Blue

outrebounded, outhustled, and out-
scored their opponents, and came
away with a 93-65 victory. It was
an auspicious beginning for the
Generals. Mike Daniel, as usual,
led the home squad with 23 points
and 10 rebounds, Skip Lichtfuss
added 19 points and 10 rebounds,
Doug Clelan, whose game has re-
cently taken an upsurge, tossed in
13 points, and added 9 big assists.
The Generals played good ball, but
still did not reach their potential.

Friday night brought one of the
the
opposition

biggest crowds of
Doremus. The

year to
was to

be provided by the Anchormen of
Rhode Island, who sported a 9-3
record, and an All-American named
Bo Wilson, Wilson carried a 26
point average into this game with
the Generals.

“Rhode Island is certainly one of

the toughest teams that we will
play,” said Coach Canfield before
the contest. He was right. After

viewing the pre-game warm-up, one
wondered if the Generals had a

chance. Rhode Island, who started
a 6-9, 6-8, 6-3 backcourt, was
taller and, perhaps a little quicker

than the home team. But, for the

first time this year, at home; the
Generals seemed to have that honed
edge of excellence. The Blue were
a fired up ballclub Friday night,
and nobody was going to -beat
them.

From the opening tap, there was
no doubt that this was to be a
fiercely contested ball game. The
Blue opened a quick 6-0 lead, but
were not able to pull away. With
7:13 left in the half, the Anchor-
men pulled up to even, at 26
apiece. The score was tied again
at 30, and then the Blue pulled
away to a 43-40 halftime lead.

The Generals, who played tough
defense throughout the game, con-
tinually came up with the big
basket. Mike Daniel led the hoop-
ers with 15 points, while Rhode
Island was paced by 6-8 Co-captain
Karl Augenstein, who had bagged
8 of 9 shots from the field, for 16
points. The Warwick, R.I. senior
hit his shots from anywhere and
everywhere,

Rhode Island came out in a man
for man defense, and quickly pulled
within one. But the Generals ran
and ran, and managed to stay at
least even, or better. Their greatest
lead was six points, at 59-53, From
there out, the game got progressively
tighter. Both teams were hitting the
boards and shooting well.

With 3:27 left in the game, Karl
Augenstein tied the score at 80.
At the 2:15 mark, Mike Daniel put
the Blue up by two, on two foul
shots, Augenstein’s lay-up at the
1:17 mark tied the score. The Gen-
erals missed their attempt, and with
‘50 seconds left, the Anchormen
called time out. Then they proceed-
ed to run the clock down to :15

seconds, and called another time
out. With about four seconds re-
maining, Rhode Island tried to

whip the ball underneath to Augen-
stein, and an alert Blue defense
intercepted the pass. The buzzer
went off, and the Generals went
into overtime.

The Anchormen scored first on
two foul shots, but Mike Daniel
tied the game at 84 apiece, with
3:43 remaining in the five minute
overtime period, With 1:25 remain-
ing, Doug Clelan put the Generals
in front on two foul shots. With
eleven seconds left in the period,

throws, which nullified Augenstein’s
two points at the :07 second mark.
This was perhaps the greatest Gen-
erals victory in the last two years.
The 88-86 triumph was a classic in
team play and hustle. Coach Can-
field went to his bench less than
usual, but then he had no reason.
Mike Daniel had 33 points, and
Skip Lichtfuss garnered 21, But the
star of the game was big Karl
Augenstein, who had 35 points, on
16 of 21 from the field, and found
time to haul down 11 rebounds.

In spite of the fact that Rhode
Island outrebounded us and shot a
better percentage, the Generals made
up for it in hustle and big plays.
This was their finest hour,

On Saturday night, the W&L
Hoopers finally ran out of gas.
They fell behind early to a tough
Baltimore Loyola team. The Gen-

erals came back, but ran out of
steam in the stretch. They were
tired, and emotionally exhausted.

They were also playing on hostile
territory, and that did not help.
The Blue shot only 37%, compared
to the Greyhounds 48%. They were
also. outbounded, and outhustled.
The final 71-62 margin was dis-
appointing, but not unexpected, con-
sidering the physical and _ psycho-
logical condition of the team, and
the caliber of the opponents.
Monday night the Generals en
tertained Bridgewater College, be-

this school depends a great deal on
alumni help, a study should be
made as to whether future alumnac
would give as much help as alumni
Perhaps one could study the alum
nae aid of Hollins and Mary Bald

favorably with our alumni gifts.
My tentative guess is that alumnac
would not give us as much as our
alumni because most girls get mar
ried and often forfeit a job which
would enable them to more easily
donate gifts to their alma matet

If we look at HEW’s figures

Honor Study:
“Weekly Report’

After about three weeks of in-
terviews, the first phase of the
honor system study is almost com-
plete. This phase was structured to
gather opinions and observations
through interviews with various
members of the faculty and ad-
ministration at Washington and Lee.
From here, the study will move
on to interview both people from

other schools — representatives of
the University of Virginia, for
example, will be interview today
—and, most importantly, members
of the W&L student body itself.
It is this last series of interviews

which is expected to yield the most
result, since the present honor sys-
tem is designed, in its own words.
to reflect the values of the “stu-
dent generation involved.” There
are. of course, informative observa-
tions to be gained from inierview-
ing faculty, past students, and stu
dents from other schools; however,
the end product of this study, what
ever that may be. must finally draw
most heavily on the ideas of the
students at Washington and Lee
today, or clse this study will not
reilect the very attitudes that are
supposed to form the backbone of
the henor system itself,

To report on some of the observa
collected to date—one point
continues to receive almost
universal mention is the point of
indoctrination. Practically everyone
interviewed so far has stressed that

frous

which

‘if an honor system such as the one
navy at Washineton and Lee is to
survive. that thorough indoctrina-

ticn is necessary. This area has
impressed several people as beine
somewhat weak in recent years. and
several have suggested that many
of the system's current problems
may stem from faulty or incomplete
indoctrination,

In the area of procedural change
ene suggestion has been made with
regard to public student body hear-
ings. The opinion was expressed
that some recent public student body
hearings have had a somewhat
circus-like atmosphere. tending to
hinge on histrionics rather than the
facts at hand. For this reason. it
was suggested that in the event
of a student's appeal to a public
hearing, the Executive Committee
should randomly select twelve and
only twelve students to serve in its
place. This new group would com-
pletely rehear the case without the
presence of any other students
(Executive Committee included) with
the possible exception of the student
body president, whose sole purpose
would be to act as an impartial
agent of procedure. No official
counsel would be allowed either
side, and the group would rule on
the case with the exact powers of
the original Executive Commitice
This procedure would, it was felt
preserve the right of appeal to the
student body while avoiding a situa-
tion which could be inconducive to
a fair hearing.

This is only one suggestion which
has come out of the faculty inter
views; there is much more material

to be gone over and assessed by
the study group, From here, the
honor system study moves on to

interviews with students from other
schools, and finally, to interviews
with WAL students themselves
Some students have been particular

will be sold on the premises.

While Dance Board officials are
confident of a large turnout for
the Fancy Dress Ball, they are wor-
ried about the possiblility that stu-
dents will try to bring their own
drinks and flasks into the dance.
This is expressly forbidden because
the beer sold at the dance, it will
be sold by the authority of ARA's
liquor license for the Cockpit.
Should the license be revoked this
Saturday for any infraction of the
state liquor laws, the Cockpit would
lose its license. The result is that
if anyone is seen at the ball with
any kind of drink or bottle othe:
than the beer being sold, he will
either be removed from his bottle,
removed from the dance or both.

lickets for Sha-na-na are $5.00

W&L: Where It Has Been, Where It Is Going .. .

W&L Faculty: How Competent Is It?

By JOHN ROBINSON

About 130 men and women make
up Washington and Lee’s faculty.
In recent years W&L has pointed
with pride to its faculty as one
of the school’s strongest academic
assets. The purpose of this article
is to evaluate how good the faculty
is; how it can improve and to reveal
some of the inner workings of this
body.

“Washington and Lee maintains
a strong faculty, so says the Wash-
ingtow and Lee Bulletin. This Uni-
versity publication emphasizes sev-
eral outstanding features of the
faculty: a large number of Ph.D.,s,
financial assistance for research,
liberal leave policy, youth, and
good salaries.

Such a declaration is expected
from an institution of higher learn-
ing. Would you anticipate any school

saying it maintained a weak faculty?
But what do educators say about
the faculty at W&L?

In 1966 a Visiting Committee
from the Southern Association of
Colleges and. Schools submitted a
report on W&L. That report, com-
piled over five years ago, said, “In
general the Visiting Committee
found the faculty of the University
competent for and. dedicated to its
task of providing outstanding educa-
tional opportunities for the students
of Washington and Lee there
is evidence of successful: teaching,
productive scholarship and re-
search, and - effective participation
in professional associations and
scholarly societies (there is)
an excellent spirit of freedom among
the faculty.”

Dr. James Leyburn, a former
Dean of the College, has been cited

 

| QUTLOOK and REVIEW

Wednesday, February 9, 1972

In a terribly trivial manner Washington and Lee has out-

grown its innocence. Recall the days when male W&L stu-

dents felt that there was at least one refuge of total masculine

supremacy

Doremus Gymnasium, Not many semesters ago

a W&L man could saunter unabashed and unclothed through-

out the labyrinth of Doremus’ locker room, If one felt a degree

of modesty, a towel quickly dispelled any chance of embar-

rassment, But the epitome of that era of innocence was skinny-
dipping in the tranquil waters of the school pool.
But alas, that age has passed. As other great. and not so

ereat, W&L traditions

have

vanished, so has swimming

“buck” (as the vernacular goes). The Athletic Department
has proclaimed that such an endeavor is an act of heresy in
the NEW $3,000,000 Doremus. Strangely, towels are no longer
de rigueur among the surrounding sweatshirts, lockers and
benches. Clothes must be worn. Perhaps, gentlemen should

not ever become naked. Or perhaps, the seasonal wave of

coed-mania has led everyone to suspect (or wish) women

are behind every corner and column,

Fellow W&L gentlemen, it seems a bit absurd. What pos-

sible harm does swimming naked entail? After all, as was

first mentioned in this passage, it is such a trivial matter. Yet

one must ponder if our institution has achieved such a cosmo-

politan level that this tiny bit of innocence must be sacrificed ?

Two years ago American campuses erupted over the U.S.

invasion of Cambodia. Several prestigious universities closed

their doors for the remainder of the spring. Kent State was

a tragic example of the violence that. developed at some
schools. The editor of the Daily Princetonian, proposed that
instead of revolting against the system, why not work within

the electoral system?

Princeton supported this concept of allowing its students

to utilize the existing system to facilitate change. The re-

sult was the “Princeton Plan.” It allowed for a class break

hefore the November, 1970 elections. Princeton students could

participate in election campaigns. Similar election recesses

were instigated by other institutions of higher learning.
\ccording to the New York Times the “Princeton Plan”
is dead, The Times reviewed a Princeton Alumni Weekly

article entitled “Princeton Plan, R.1P."

The piece explained

that the faculty defeated a proposal for the possible 1972

remstatement of the plan by a vote of 97 to 36. No student

protest was voiced,

Three factors combined to put the

“Princeton Plan” in a

premature grave: cost, time and apathy

During the 11 day break

in 1970,

400 athletes had te

remain at the school because of fall sports. The bill was $53,

as an “Outstanding Educator in
America.” The Professor of Soci-
ology is largely recognized as being
responsible for some of the basic
upgradings in the faculty. He stated,
“One of the first things to impress
me here was that full professors
taught classes at every level, especi-
ally freshmen classes. | came from
Yale, and the teaching was. better
here than at Yale. There is a great
deal of response or give and take
due to the small classes. Profes-
sors know from class reactions
when they are getting across.”

The president of W&L’s chapter
of the American Association of Uni-
versity Professors, Dr. Milton Col-
vin, adheres to the belief that our
faculty is quite outstanding. He
commented, “We have a_ strong
willed and strong minded faculty.
We are the envy of all schools in
the Commonwealth, One reason is
that we have a very institutionally
loyal faculty.

A strong faculty is similar to a
strong student body in at least one
essential sense. That is recruitment.
An excellent faculty will wither and
die unless a concentrated, conscienti-
ous and continuing effort is made to
acquire and retain new teachers.

According to the Southern As-
sociation of Colleges and Schools,
“The institution has a good plan
for the recruitment and selection of
faculty. Its salary scale is  suffici-
ently flexible and adequate to permit
employment and retention of the
strong individuals needed to up-
grade the faculty.” The Association's
1966 report also states, “The aca-
demic preparation of the faculty is
good. The members hold degrees
from a variety of excellent uni-
versities.”

The mechanics of hiring and fir-
ing professors is centered in each
academic department. The appro-
priate academic dean approves the
hiring recommendations from each
department. In addition the Presi-
dent of the University meets and
accepts each candidate before he
or she is hired.

Where do the faculty come from?
There is a trend for W&L profes-
sors to attend southern undergradu-
ate institutions. The largest faculty
contingent calls WA&L its alma
mater. Exactly 25 per cent of last
year’s faculty attended W&L. Other
undergraduate institutions that pro-
duced several of our faculty mem-
bers include: UNC, Davidson,
Oberlin, Virginia, Duke, and Har-
vard. When you review the graduate
schools that the faculty attended,
you. discover that over a_ third
went to at least one of four uni-
versities: UNC, Virginia, Harvard,
and Columbia. Eight professors
went to law school or graduate
school at W&L (the University had
a master’s program at one time).
Considerably more faculty mem-
bers went to Ivy League graduate
schools than attended Ivy League
undergraduate schools, One trend is
obvious——-W&L has a considerable
number (32) of alumni faculty.

Anther trend is quite marked in
faculty hiring at W&L. The Uni-
versity almost exclusively _ hires
white. male teachers. Only two
women are teaching faculty mem-
bers; no blacks are on the faculty
even though the school has been
integrated for four years,

The pair of female faculty mem-
bers, Dr. F. H. Gray of the Biology
Department and Miss Margaret
Brown of the Psychology Depart
ment, do not have tenure, Both are
temporary. Neither feels W&L dis
criminates against women teachers
Dr. Gray said, “I think people
should be hired on their ability. If
women are qualified they should
be hired like men. In many cases
men get the jobs because people
feel men will stay with the job
longer, even though statistics doen't
bear this out.” Miss Brown is at

W&L only for the winter and spring
terms. She commented, “I'm very
happy with the teaching set-up. It
seems, if W&L hired me, it can-
not be negative to women; if it's
appropriate and the women = are
qualified, then they can be hired.”

Dean of the College, William
Watt expressed his view on. the
female faculty member shortage, “I
have no definite plans to hire a
woman for the faculty, but I have
no definite plans not to. There are
no restrictions of race, sex, or relig-
ion whatsoever in hiring.”

Once a teacher joins the faculty,
tenure becomes important. Perhaps
in an oversimplification, tenure can
be defined as a teacher's job security.
Tenure insures a professor of his
position and income. A key group
that watchdogs the tenure system
nationwide is the American Associ-
ation of University Professors.
(AAUP). The Southern Association
of Colleges and Schools 1966 re-
port concluded that, “In regard to

tenure the general recommendations
of the AAUP are followed by the
University.”

Closely linked with tenure is the
problem of promotions. Washing-
ton and Lee adopted a “University-
wide Policy on Salaries, Reappoint-
ments, and Promotions” in February
of 1971. This document provides
the prime criteria for promotion
as well as salary increases. Accord
ing to this policy statement, “Every
faculty member should be a good
academic citizen, loyal to the Uni-
versity with freedom of thought
and expression, ready to cooperate
with other faculty members, willine

and the Advisory Committee to the
President. Recommendations involv-
mg tenure, and promotions to as
sociaie or full professor are acted
on by the Board of Trustees.”

Linked with the University's
policy on promotion is a schedule
of compulsory retirement. In order
to make room for promotions and
io encourage youth, all department
heads and administrative officers
must retire at 65. Retired depart-
ment heads and other professors
may continue to teach until 70

is from teacher to dean. Although

for both assistant professors and

instructors,

Dr. Colvin added some insight
to these AAUP figures, Colvin said,
“Only two thirds of the colleges
and universities submit their salary
figures to the AAUP. So, compari-
sons of salaries are not exact. In
general W&L has the second high-
est salaries in the Commonwealth,
Only the University of Virginia pays
more. Most schools in the South
pay lower teaching salaries than
schools in other sections of the
country. So for the South W&L
ranks high, with only Vanderbilt,
Duke, UNC, and Virginia offering
better salaries, It must be remem-
bered that universities with gradu-
ate schools ordinarily pay better.
Cne thing is certain, W&L ranks
within the top 100. colleges in
America in faculty salaries,”

In addition to W&L’s salaries, the
University offers a retirement plan
and lucrative fringe benefits. The
Southern Association of Colleges
and Schock, cited these benefits in
its 1966 report on W&L: “Financial
sec. rity is provided for the faculty
by an excellent program of fringe
b_o-fits to supplement the salaries.”

Some of the most salient issties
facing the faculty are handled by
faculty committees. One criticism
that a younger faculty member voic-
ed was the predominance of W&L
alumni on the most inflential com-
mittees. Checking with the Wash-
ington and Lee University Bulletin
1971-72, this claim was confirmed
to a certain extent, Last year’s Fac-
ulty Advisory Committee consisted
of 50 per cent WAL alumni (how-
ever three of the six members were
selected ex officio) The Faculty
Executive Committee was made up
of one quarter W&L men (again
four of the eight members were
selected ex officio), The faculty
representation on the Student Affairs
Committee last year was 60 per
cent alumni. The point being made
by the criticizing professor was that
teachers from undergraduate schools
other than W&L seem to be neglect-
ed on policy formulation commit-
tees. One faculty member, a WAL
alumnus, felt that this phenomenon
was understandable. He said an
alumnus would inherently be more
interested in committee work al
his alma mater than someone from
outside the university.

What happens when a faculty
member is dissatisfied with a situation
existing on campus? What grievance
aliernatives are available? Accord-
ing to Dr. Milton Colvin a pair of
routes exist. The first route is to
work within the local AAUP. “A
faculty member asks the organiza-
tion to speak with the President,”
Colvin explained. “During the three
terms that Ive been president of
the chapter, I've been to President
Cole and President Huntley about
half a dozen times. Each problem
was quickly and satisfactorily re
solved. | might add to my amuse-
ment, er annoyance, that each in-
stance involved a non-union man.”

The second pattern of grievance
setilement according to Colvin is
guaranteed by the faculty by-laws.
If a person with tenure is fired,
then that person is entitled to a
trial by a jury of his or her peers.

Washington and Lee prides itself
on a close student-faculty relation
ship and small classes. The size of
the faculty is a vital factor in
boih cases. What is the student
fuculity relationship here and at
other places? That depends entirely
on whe is classified as a faculty
member, Some institutions classify
their school lecturers as
fucully. Lovejoy’s guide to colleges

By LEX McMILLAN

Like a giant geometric leviathan
the new structure stands firmly if
somewhat incongruously amidst the
classic lines of Greek Revival archi-
tecture and the graceful curves of
the Shenandoah’s natural endow-
ment, Its recent arrival is reflected
in the surrounding ground which still
loudly mourns its scars. But hidden
within this youthful intruder is a
world of wonders and an invitation
to new adventures. Walking in
familiar entrances one recognizes
old sites which have been face-
lifted, This serves as a transitional
buffer to the complete newness
which lies further in,

Passing through the same old
locker room and glancing aside you
notice the familiar showers you've
used since you first arrived, The
characteristic smell of chlorine mix-
ed with the steam and sweat
weighted air indicates that the pool
you plunged into from the fore-
boding balcony still remains, Then
you notice the dead end that was,
is dead no longer, Indeed, a verit-
able cornucopia of athletic — life
greets you enveloped in shiny new
glass, bold steel beams, highly
polished woods and all the extras
that modern man has devised. In
short, you are in the new gym.

A bold addition to the campus
costing well over three million dol-
lars, it will inevitably affect a
change in campus life. The staff has
already noticed the influx of new
faces, new spare tires and new
muscles, It seems quite likely that
the new gym will spark a rebirth
of enthusiasm for physical pursuits.

This new interest in the physical
has a mildly comical side. Most
of you are aware that there has
been some criticism leveled at the
administration for this particular
undertaking. You know the kind:
“We need a new library, a new
Law School, a new building for the
‘C’ School and what do we g7t.
a new gym!” or maybe this com-
ment; “The P.E. department is one
of the largest in the University, as
long as we're building a new gym
why not have a major in P.E.” or
better yet: “I came here to learn,

to gain knowledge, not to be a
jock; I could’ve gone to ie
State if I wanted to be a jock.
They're wasting my tuition on a
gym” (indignant tone), I’m sure
you've heard them all and I won't
attempt to argue with these com-
ments. The funny thing is that a lot
of these “anti-bodies” are finding
themselves enamored with the broad
spectrum of facilities contained in
the new gym.

You can see these former com-
plainers turning into jocks before
your very eyes. Two buddies (who
alt some time in the recent past
had sat in the Cockpit bemoaning
the distorted priorities of the Uni-
versity reflected in the building of
the new gym) run into each other
in the locker room. As the first
student pulls on his handball gloves
his friend rounds the corner sweat-
ing and trembling having just
emerged from a forty minute Sauna.
The ensuing conversation consits of
nervous laughs and some passing
comment aobut ‘jocking-it-up’, ete.

The point is that this new gym
is an alvantageous and peneficial
addition to the University. It may
serve to re-emphasize the signific-
ance of developing your body as
well as your mind, This is nothing
new, the Greeks of the Sth century
B.C. were enthusiastic in their pur-
suit of this sort of balanced life.

Those who have eagerly anticipat-
ed the completion of the gym know
that the final completion has be-
come an enigmatic figure always
just around the corner. This has
caused frustration for all concerned.
Now that the gym is almost com-
pleted it is becoming clear what
type of facility we have and what
the range of its offerings are. Un-
questionably the range is impressive.

However, now that we can get in
there and actually use the facilities,
certain problems are arising which
interfere with the fullest possible
use of the new gym. For instance,
the basket system is set up with
open backs so that they could be
serviced with periodic laundering
and a regular change of the towels,
yet this is not done. It you want

Price of Beer To Be

I wish to inform the student body
that beginning Wednesday, February

a glass in the Cockpit from 4 until
6 p.m. This policy was decided
upon by Mr, Sumner, manager of

with the University Center Comit-

Sexual Segregation, Is It
Different From Racial?

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Imagine that the year is 1965
and a debate is raging at W&L as
to whether the university should
open its doors to black students, In
a letter to the Phi, a student makes
the following comments:

“Washington and Lee offers a
choice that fewer and fewer col-
leges are offering—the choice to
attend an all-white school. There
is a very wide choice of integrated
schools and an_ increasingly nar-
rower choice of segregated insti-
tutions, Anyone who wants to go
to an integrated school has more
than enough opportunity.

“Also a long term view must be
taken about alumni donations, Per-
haps one could study the alumni aid
of Howard and Tuskegee and see
whether it compares favorably with
our alumni gifts. My guess is that
black alumni would not give as
much because most blacks take jobs

as janitors and shoeshine boys,

_ “A white outlook is the nature of
this institution in the same way
an athletic viewpoint is the nature
of the NFL. To argue that it is
‘unreal’ is irrelevant; one might as
well argue that our society has an
unreal atmosphere because the white
outlook predominates,”

These are, of course, the argu-
ments advanced by Nick Wreden’s
letter of last week, and the sub-
ject was women, not blacks. If Mr.
Wreden’s points are valid, however,
they are equally valid as to both,
Yet no one has been heard lately
advocating that W&L resegregate in
order to provide a “unique” haven
for the racist point of view, The
reason is that there is a consensus
today that racial segregation was
wrong; even the Richmond Times-
Disgrace pays lip service to it.

The question | would like to ask
Mr. Wreden and the other op-
ponents of coeducation, and the
question they will have to answer to
change my stand on the issue, is
this: How is sexual segregation dif-
ferent from racial segregation?

State Of The Uni on

By W. PATRICK HINELY

Since | myself am not an expert
economist, | shall quote one who
is. He is Karl Schiller, Finance
Minister of West Germany, a nation
which has come a long way since
1945, Last month, he told the West
German Parliament that the nations
of the world should institute a multi-
national monetary system, since the
U.S. dollar is no longer capable of
supporting the economies of the
Western world.

Schiller didn’t even explore the
possibilities of a truly GLOBAL
monetary system, which would in-
clude the nation which is destined
to become the next superpower as
the U.S. fades a bit from the
scene: the People’s Republic of
China, But then, people who are
really into money can only see so
far.

In Schiller’s words, “Monetary
policy must become free of the
accidents of the American balance of
payments,” We're not so perfect
after all, On January 28 last, Uncle
Walter told us on CBS News that
the USSR had outproduced the U.S.
in steel during 1971. The figures
were 132.8 million tons for the
Russkies to our 120 million tons.
During 1971, the U.S. also ended
up in the red in world trade for
the first time in history.

Could all this mean something
significant?

The British people came to a
great shock when they realized that
the sun was indeed setting on their
empire. However, they have since
accepted their place in a com-
munity of nations, They have finally
been admitted to the Common
Market, which means the British are
being accepted by their neighbors
on an equal basis. (As soon as they
give the people of Northern breland
a free voice in deciding their civil

affairs, they'll be in pretty good
shape.)

The U.S. isn’t in quite as com-
promised a position yet, but the
figures | cited above are indications
that our once unquestioned world
superiority is crumbling. Can we as
a people accept that?

| certainly hope so, and would
strongly recommend it. The fool-
ishly proud “we're the best and it's
my country right or wrong” attitude
which seems to permeate the Penta-
gon can get us into a lot of
trouble. With the nuclear weapons
at our disposal, we are capable of
destroying the world. Of course.
once we start, we'll have plenty of
help from Russia, China, and then
there are our allies who will natur-
ally want to get their own two
megatons into the game.

This is only a possibility, We also
have the choice of turning the
Pentagon on its side and painting it
purple and green and then using
the power we have left to persuade
the world, through respect and
example rather than money and
coercion that we are indeed what
some Americans in the past have
claimed we are: the greatest nation
in the history of man.

A few years ago, some “weirdo”
types started yelling at us from
obscure places like Greenwich Vil-
lage and various progressive cam-
puses (most of which, by the
way, are coed . . .) that we should
stop our materialistic rat race and
start examining the QUALITY of
our lives. This is the old maxim of
“quality, not quantity.” Lyndon
Johnson envisioned this in his
“Great Society,” but being too
human, he got into Vietnam too
deeply, and we are still triyng to
get out of that one,

scores of ways. A recent (1970)
example was the decision of Ivy
League colleges in the United
States to de-emphasize geogra-
phical considerations in their ad-
missions policies . . . Between
the 1930's and the 1950's, for
example, Harvard cut in half the
percentage of its students from
homes in New England and New
York. Today, says an official of
the university, “We're pulling back
on this geographical distribution
thing.”

Place is now recognized as no
longer a primary source of di-
versity . . . Says the dean of
admission of Yale, ... Yale
has virtually dropped geography
altogether as a consideration in
selection. And his counterpart at
Princeton reports: “It is not the
place they're from, really, but
rather some sense of a different
background that we're looking
for,”

Second, the pros and cons of
coeducation at W&L. My _ biggest
complaint is that there are no coeds
here, but this school’s outstanding
qualities and my getting accustomed
to this place has kept me _ here.
| had thought, “sure, girls would
be nice here”, because that would
make things better for me. Yet now
I realize that W&L should maintain
its distinctiveness and offer an al-
ternative to coeducation. I don’t
feel an all-male school is better,
but | think that that is W&L’s
role,

Third, a student last week com-
plained of inadequate parking space
on campus and pleaded for more
spaces. I believe a better point of
view is that there are too many
cars, And there are probably too
many spaces already, This campus
can be degraded like any city by
being overwhelmed by cars. If only
necessary cars were on campus —
those of dorm residents, of people
who live far away, and of visitors—
then, I believe, parking would be
easy. Walking and bicycling could
substitute, and be good for you too,

A Matter of Ethics

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:
| am writing this letter both as
a member of Students for Coeduca-
tion and as an individual deeply
concerned about Washington and
Lee and it’s future. Above all other
matters, coeducation is the most
pressing issue we face, The major
component of this issue has been
lost in the discussion of Plans I
and Il, dormitory space, curricular
design, etc. The issue is one of
philosophy and ethics, not eco-
nomics and logistics. No one is ask-
ing Washington and Lee to be-
come coeducational without plan-
ning for it so that the best interests
of the university are met. All that
is secondary to the examination of
our educational philosophy and the
morality of an all male school.

I quote from the official educa-
tional philosophy of this university.

“Fundamental to all other as-
pirations of Washington and Lee
are two basic purposes:

—the dedication of all its re-
sources to the development of
man’s capacity and desire to learn,
to understand, and to pass on to
others the varied benefits of this
intellectual growth.

—the pursuit of its educational
purpose in a climate of learning
that stresses the importance of the
individual, his personal honor and
integrity, his harmonious relation.
ship with his fellow man, and his
responsibility to serve society
through the productivity of his

training and his talent,”

The admission of women to this
university would require no change
in this philosophy. What it would
mean is that at last Washington
and Lee will begin to practice that
philosophy. The exclusion of women
as a group contradicts the emphasis
we put on the individual. It contra-
dicts our interest in learning and
understanding when we intention-
ally restrict women from participat-
ing in the learning environment, We
have limited our intellectual and

Dicantintaininieein iiss nia died

Odds and ends put together while
reflecting on last Saturday's halftime
show . the W&L Athletic De-
partment is rightfully concerned by
the latest show of Women’s Libera-
tion. As you've probably heard,
girls have been showering with boys.
mixed couples have been entertain-
ing themselves in the sauna, and
girls, naturally attired, have been
seen riding the gym elevators . . .
To combat this problem, members
of the coaching staff are taking
shifts policing the area, especially
the elevators Meanwhile, a
number of girls have complained
about the lack of facilities for
the females . . . And speaking of
saunas, a big midwestern school is
having similar problems in which
couples have been taking advantage
of the salubrious effects of the
Swedish steam practice One
of the best deals that the Athletic
Department has set up is the $42
skiing deal with The Homestead
Not only can students get a lesson
and a day on the slopes for about
$7 «a shot, but they get gym
credit The average cost for
a day, without lessons, for anyone
else is $10.50. . . At those savings,
who can complain? Hats off and a
big round of thanks to all those
who made last Saturday's WLUR-
Ring-tum Phi half-time  extraxa
ganza. John Hughes as the refree

was particularly entertaining
And the rumor running around the
Phi office is that a re-match is
inevitable . . . The second best
show of the night was a_ perform-
ance by Emory and Henry’s coach,
“Arnold.” Although his childish
chair-kicking, which netted him a
technical foul is not to be con-
doned, Arnold nevertheless had a
legitimate complaint. The umpiring
last Saturday night was some of the
most atrocious this writer has seen
in four years at W&L ... As a
matter of fact, the entire season
seems to be marked by an over-all
decline in the quality of the referees,
in Which all teams have suffered
Maybe the Minnesota affair
involving the suspension of Corky

79-72 Lynchburg Loss fo
Gives W&L 12-6 Mark

By PALMER TRICE

fhe Generals saw their undefeat-
ed college division in-state record
go down the drain in a thriller on
Monday night, 79-72,

The opponents were the Lynch-
burg Hornets, who stormed back
from the brink of disaster to catch
the Blue in the second half. The

game was good, the crowd was
right, but the Generals couldn't
come up with the killer instinct

when they need it.

Last Wednesday’s contest with
Hampden-Sydney proved even
tougher than many had figured, The
Tigers, playing at home, came up
with a fine game, and took the
visitors into overtime, before drop-
ping a 78-75 decision. The game
was marked by three technicals, one
each on the respective coaches, and
one on the Tigers big center,
Burness.

The Generals led at the half by
four, 36-32. With 9:10 remaining
in the game, Hampden-Sydney tied
the score at 53, At the 5:30 mark,
the score was knotted at 58 apiece.
With six seconds in the regular
playing time, guard Charlie Strain
missed a foul shot. Burness hauled
down the rebound, and called time
out. The Tigers, stifled by the Gen-
eral defense, failed to get off a shot
in regulation.

Early in the overtime period, the
Generals fell behind by four. They
took the lead for the: first time
with 1:48 remaining, 71-70, on a
Doug Clelan jumper. Skip Lichtfuss
added two more, and the Generals
final margin of three occurred. The
Hoopers employed a match-up de-
fense, mixed in with a full court
press. Coach Canfield was proud

of his ball club, “They kept their
poise.”

Saturday night saw the Generals
come up on the long end of another
thriller. Emory and Henry came to
town with revenge on the brain,
They almost got what they came
for. The game was much closer
than the final 75-73 score indicated.

The Blue fell behind the Wasps
early. In the season’s first encounter,
Emory and Henry had dropped a
93-72 decision to the Generals.
When the visitors grabbed an early
19-14 lead, many in Doremus were
surprised, including the Generals,
Not too surprised, the home team
stormed back, using a good fast
break, to grab a 45-38 lead at the
half.

The game stayed tight through-
out the second half. The Wasps

at the 7:06 mark in the second half.
Charlie Strain put the Generals
back in front on two foul shots,
72-71, with 1:46 remaining in the
game. Doug Clelan’s foul shots
boosted the Blue lead-to four, 75-71,
and gave them the insurance tallies
that they needed to offset a last
second basket by the Wasps. The
game was marred by many tense
calls, one of which prompted the
E&H coach to kick over one of
the chairs in his bench. This one
might have been more of a squeaker
than the one in Death Valley.

“Letting Go”

(Continued from page 3)
clean gym clothes you take them
out and do them yourself else-
where. The gym does offer you a
clean towel as frequently as you
desire to change it. Of course you
can only change it when the equip-
ment room is open and that is from
am. to 6 p.m. Monday thru
Friday. This points out another
problem and that is the equipment
room's limited availability. It is
never open in the evenings nor on
the weekends. The same is true for
the pool. The old pool can be used
only when the equipment room is
open, The new pool is not yet open

at all to the campus public.

Thus, it is clear that the total
utilization of the new gym is hamp-
ered. What is the central problem
behind this? In talking with Mr.
McHenry, the Director of Athletics,
last week, the one main obstacle to
greater use of the gym appeared to
be too few personnel. People are
needed to man the equipment room,
to handle laundering and to life-
guard the pools before the gym
can expand the availability of its
facilities. Mr. McHenry pointed out
that the gym is for the entire
campus community, not just the
athletes, It is his desire to make the
sym as available as reason allows.
But he also points out the simple
logistical reality of the thousands of
square feet that have to be cared
for by the custodial staff,

The lack of adequate staffing ts
attested to by dusty handball courts
and corridors, absence of soap in
the showers and muddy floors in the
shower area. This is not meant to
criticize but simply to point out
that the gym needs more manpower.
Of course, part of the problem will
be eliminated when the gym ts
officially turned over the University
by the contractors and the workmen
leave the building. But, undoubtedly
the Athletic Department will need a
lareer custodial staff if the Uni
versity community is to fully benefit
from the new gym. As long as we've
eone this far, we might as well
ro 6a little further to make the
facility optimally functional.

Another issue which is of interest
to an ever-growing minority is the
question of facilities for women.
Mr. McHenry has informed me that
a very large and comfortable locke!
room is being prepared for the
women at WAL. It is located on
the first floor next to the pool in
the Northwest corner of the build-
ing. Mr, McHenry hesitated to name

date for completion because of
the many delays he has already ex-
perienced. However, after looking
over the room, it was clear that the
completion shouldn't be too far in
the future

Mr. McHenry expressed his in
terest in knowing what students are
thinking and noted that he wel-
comes suggestions for improving the
eym's capabilities. The new gym: is
in good hands and it will un-
doubtedly broaden the spectrum of
WAL’s attractive features. However,
it is clear that certain rough edges
need smoothing. It would. be. a
shame to fail to carry the possibili-
ties to their reasonable ends and
stunt the young gym's growth and
development

Honor Study:
‘Weekly Report’

Last Wednesday several members
of the honor system study group
interviewed the Chairman of the
Honor Council at the University of
Virginia, Tom Bagby. The purpose
of the trip to Charlottesville was to
compare the effectiveness and struc-
ture of their honor system with our
own, During the discussion several
differences in the two system be-
came apparent

First of all, UVa‘s system places
considerably more responsibility on
the individual than does the system
at W&L. At UVa the procedure
leading to an honor trial is as fol-
lov the student who observes a
possible honor violation (the ac
) approaches the accused and
» explain his actions; if
is unable to provide a

reasonable explanation, the accuser
takes it upon himself to ask the
accused to leave the university. I
the accused willfully leaves the unt
versity, the case is never brought
before the Honor Council. But if
the accused refuses to leave, the
matter is taken to the Honor Coun-
cil, and an investigation ensues
However, if a reasonable explana
tion is given by the accused in the
first place, the whole matter ts
dropped
Secondly, UVa seems to have a
more extensive orientation program
to their honor system, Newly en-
rolled students first hear a speech
on the system; then they discuss
the system at length with their
dorm counselors; and finally they
are given a chance to question mem
hers of the Honor Council. The goal
is for freshmen and transfers to
have a thorough knowledge of the
svstem from the very Start
Thirdly, UVa‘'s Honor Council
xists as a separate entity from the
body responsible for their student
government. The Honor Council is
made up of officers from each
school of the university {these

sentatives, and this has caused prob
lems in determining the views held

are much more legalistic than those

versity’s first great benefactor.

President Robert F. R. Huntley
will be the principal speaker, and
is expected to deliver a far-ranging
address on the state of the uni-
versity.

Dr. John Newton Thomas of
Richmond, rector of the Washington
and Lee board of trustees, and
John M. Thomas of Dallas, Tex..
a board member and chairman of
its development committee, will join
Mr. Huntley in addressing the con-
vocauion

Attendance of all students at the

Convocation is expected. The fac

Mock Convention Head
Outlines Progress To E.C.

By JOHN ZINK

The Executive Committee heard
from the chairman of the 1972
Mock Convention Mike Campilongo
on the progress being made to pre
pare for the Mock Convention to
be held in early May. Campilongo
expressed his concern that the pres-
ent rate of progress was not great
enough

Campilongo said. “We are not as
far along as I would like to be
This thing (the Mock Convention)
is not magic: it does not have to
be a full time job, but it does
require some concentrated effort.”
When asked by Glenn Azuma, E.C.
vice-president, what shape the state
delegations are in at the present
time, Campilongo explained that all
state delegations have chairmen ex
cept for three states. He also point-
ed out that 17 state delegations are
full at this time and that 300 to
400 people are active in these
delegations.

The work of the state chairman
was stressed as being an important
factor in the progress of the Mock

Convention. “I am not pleased by
the progress, or I should say the
lack of progress on the part of the
state chairmen,” complained Cam
pilongo, He did add, however, that
the state chairmen have had a very
difficult job because they must con-
tact the state chairman to the real
National Democratic Convention
for the state that they represent.
“Some of these guys (the Demo-
cratic Chairman) will not even give
us the time of day,” said Campi-
longo. For this reason, he urged
that all Mock Convention state
chairmen start this part of their
task immediately.

The main question posed by the
members of the EC concerned the
financial position of the Mock Con-
vention at the present time. Campi
longo said that the Mock Conven-
tion now has $6,000 cash reserve
on deposit with a local bank and
the University. He pointed to the
largest expenditure so far as being
in the area of fund raising activi
ties and telephone costs. “We have
paid out slightly over $1,000 at this
time. two-thirds of which has been
for fund raising and about $100 for
phone bills.” commented Campi-
longo. He continued by saying that
the telephone cosis should go up,
predicting that phone costs would
be between $1,500 and $2,000 for
the period from now until the con-
vention date

Several EC members expressed
concern over keeping the telephone
bills at a minimum. Lock Handley
asked. “How js the security on the
phone?” Campilongo responded by
saving. “We have not had any
trouble with people misusing the
phone so far; there is always some-
one in the Mock Convention office
whenever it is open

hour (1:30).

Students are requested to be in
their seats before 12 o'clock so that
the assembly can begin promptly.

The Founders’ Day will represent
a departure from a long standing
tradition at Washington and Lee
University. Even National Review
commented on the date change from
Lee's birthday to Washington's
birthday.

According to university by-laws
Lee’s birthday is to be a_ holiday
with an assembly. But this year the
faculty voted to move the event
back about a month. Bob Keefe,
Director of Public Information,
said it was only under “extraordin-
ary circumstances” that the date
vas altered. Keefe said the faculty
postponed the celebration because
of an upcoming Board of Trustees
meeting that might affect President
Huntley's announcement.

The faculty has already approved
next year’s calender which provides
for a holiday on Lee's birthday. So
the Founders’ Day assembly will be
held once again next year on Janu-
ary 19.

Week Set For
Black Culture

By LARRY D. JONES
Assistant to the Dean of Students
and Advisor to S.A.B.U,

In America today, where we are
constantly made aware of the po-
larization of the races; where we
find more time and money to sup-
port our outer-space ego; where
many students across the nation
are being more enlightened by
“speed” and “pot” than anything
else. | am happy to note that Wash
ington and Lee University has taken
a more constructive attitude. | am
elated to announce that a dream
which | have had for the past
couple of years is finally approach
ine reality. That dream is to have
a Black Culture program here

On the dates February 28-March
4. 1972, Washington and Lee will
witness an educational first. That
week has been dedicated “Black
Week.” My Brothers have worked
to establish a program which we
hope will be an on-going tradition
among the many traditions at W&l
We wish to thank President Huntley,
the administration, the organiza
tions, and the many faculty mem
bers and students who have sup-
ported us in this effort

However. the work has only be

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Third In A Series

W G&L: Where It Has Been, Where It Is Going .. .

Development Offic

By J. HAGOOD ELLISON

The Office of Development is one
phase of the University administra-
tion with which students rarely have
contact. Yet this office plays a key
role in the short-run operations and.
long-term growth of Washington
and Lee, Not only are the Develop-
ment. staff responsible for meeting
any immediate costs, but they are
charged with the financial develop-
ment of the school.

This office is relatively new on
campus, scarcely over a decade old.
With operating expenses spiraling.
WAL, like all universities, has had
to open separate committees and
offices to meet the ever-increasing
needs. The “Self-Study Report of
the University, 1964-1966," called
for “more formally established de-
velopment services, on a continuing
basis, to meet the University’s
financial requirements of the future.”
This was reiterated in the “Report
of the Visiting Committee to Wash-
ington and Lee” by the Southern
Association of Colleges and Schools.
in November, 1966. Their ten-man
committee acknowledged that the
University had, by then, taken signi-
ficant steps toward a “more so-
phisticated development program.”

The following is taken from an
interview with Director of Develop-
ment Farris Hotchkiss, who has
served in that capacity since 1962.
He talks about the role of the De-
velopment Office. the problems en-
countered in funding the addition to
Doremus, and the financial prob-
lems of coeducation.

Ring-tum Phi: Why was the De-
velopment. Office started?

Hotchkiss: The proper way to put
that is that the Development Office
was reestablished in 1968; W&L
had a development function as long

ago as 1950, In fact, for a small
school, we were one of the leaders
in the development area. Mr. James
Whitehead who is now our Trea-
surer, came in 1958 to become
director of development and stayed
in that job through 1962 approxi-
mately, when he became Assistant
to the President and then Treasurer.

The great difference though is
that for many years Washington and
Lee and other private schools de-
pended very heavily on a reservoir
of goodwill and generous feelings
from people that we assumed would
simply emanate naturally from their
having had contact with our school,
This was not an unrealistic way to
look at it. Presuming that you
turned out a good product, that
is your students, and presuming that
the school remained admirable in
all respects, it could be expected
that people» of wealth would na-
turally come to your aid, both
through gifts during their lifetime

and through their estates. What
happened, though, is that the
school realized that we could no

longer rely on what | suppose you
might call “good public relations”
to carry on in regard to our fund
raising.

So the Development Office was
organized or reorganized in 1968
with three specific functions in mind.
The first was, to raise each year
the necessary amount of money to
make up the difference between
what if cost to operate during an
academic year and our revenues,
For instance, last year it took $737,-
000 to make up that difference and
keep us in the black. This part of
the development function is gen-
erally called Annual Giving; it is
the Alumni Fund, the Parents’ Fund,
certain gifts that come from

generally don’t operate in the an-

purposes. This is far less noticable
activity in-as-emuch as you don't
have squads of class agents and
others running around the coun-
try. It tends to be a quiet, individu-
alized approach with people who
are known to have the resources
that are sufficient to make large
gifts. Generally speaking. in this
office, this is carried out through
the efforts of the President of the

University, and through my own
efforts.
Now, the third area is what is

called Deferred Giving and this is
probably one of the most exciting
and encouraging areas in educa-
tional development work today. You
might need a little bit of explana-

Ring-tum .Phi: What problems do
you foresee in going coed?

answer your questions. two ways.
From a fund raising standpoint, |
don't think there would. be any

no doubt that there would be some
of our alumni who would at

primarily, would not stay so un-

would hurt us from a fund raising
standpoint. There might be a little
bobble on the other side of the
fence: coeducation is a very ex-

to give over to the university, on
an irrevocable basis, certain assets,
but retain the income from those
assets for his lifetime and. if he so
chooses, for the lifetime of one
of his beneficiaries. That is the kind

a forecast for fund raising develop-
ment .for the next ten years?,

Hotehkiss:. Well,.in the next ten
years,. Washington and Lee will see
a comprehensive. development .. pro-
gram that will call for the addition
to the-campus of several buildings
like the .gymnasium,.like the law
school. building,. like the | library,
and. some. refurbishing. of buildings
that are already. on our campus
that are perfectly sound in most
respects. but need work. There is
a good deal of planning with land-
scape. architects. that is going on
right now in order to decide how
to develop what we might. call the
expanded campus, the part of the
campus that. falls on the. western
side of the ravine.

In addition to that, we know that
WA&L simply will not be in healthy
financial shape.in say, 1980,. if
between now. and then there hasn't
been a drastic increase in our en-
dowment.. We-have an endowment
that fluctuates of course from month
to month. There.is about a 20 to
22 million. dollar endowment, and
it is generally. considered that .the
endowment is going to have to
grow by perhaps a like amount in
the next decade. Washington and
Lee ought to be having twice the
endowment earning available to it
in 1980,.as it does now,

So we are talking about a de-
velopment. program that is obvi-
ously in the tens of millions of
dollars. The trustees are in the final
stages of capping that kind of pro-
gram off. We already are raising
money even though we don't have
an announced program on our
hands. We are not letting that hold
us back from talking to foundations
and corporations. and people who
are in the position to make major
gifts. Some of these gifts have al-
ready been fortheoming, like the
Keenan gift for instance. a $600,-
000, that was announced at gradua-
tion last year, and like some of the
scholarship funds that have come to
us as endowment additions, and the
gymnasium gifts. We are not letting
the fact that we dont have a
finely polished and ‘all the ques-
tions answered’ development pro-
gram, prevent us from going ahead
and raising substantial funds.

Ring-tum Phi: As far as looking
back on the last ten years, will
you comment on the success or
failure of the development pro-
gram?

Hotchkiss: Well, looking back
ten years, | think that WA&L’s fund
raising efforts have been remark-
ably good. I really do. The Trustees
of this university have taken an
unusual hand in seeing to it that
we remain. financially healthy. All
you have to do these days is pick
up most any newspaper. | see the
Chronicle of Education. once a week
and hardly a week goes by that it
isn't announced that one school or
another. is in serious financial
trouble, going in the red more and
more. The wealthiest schools in the
U.S.. the wealthiest schools in the
world, are in the red. and I think
the fact that WAL has stayed in
the black, without having to cut
its services is commendable. We
are not reducing our faculty, we
are not depriving our students of
anything that they have enjoyed in
the past.

In fact. in modesi ways we are
offering them more than they did
enjoy in the past. and with all of
that we are staying solidly in the
black. Our annual giving programs.
that, probably more than any of
the others, are specifically respon-
sible for this kind of success and
have been going up nicely every
year. | guess the most dramaiic
thing that | can point to along
that line. is the fact that the trustees
established the Robert E. Lee As
sociates Program in 1968; this pro
gram is designed for persons who
take an unusual interest in the uni
versily and express that interest
quite frankly, monetarily. This as-
sociation now has over 300 people

hat Is Its Role?

in it, and this | think points out, to
a certain extent, the kind of mo-
mentum and response that we have
been able to generate.

Let me say just one more thing.
| have a thought that | would like
to share with you that | feel very
strongly about. This country of ours
must have, it seems to me, a_bal-
anced. educational system. I think
that we would be greatly harmed
if we ever got to the point where
all of our schools were state schools,
or all of our schools were private
schools, or all were church schools,
and since W&L University repre-

We should always maintain a mix,
sents the private or independent
sector of education, | think that all

of us who have anything to do
with it — whether we're students
under that system or work for

that system, or are alumni of that
system, or whatever — need to re-
member that the very definition of
what a private, independent school
is, is partially that the school has
from the beginning assumed that it
must raise its own funds to meet
its Own expenses without receiving
help from church or state. So often,
I think, people who are connected
with private schools fool themselves
by assuming that fund raising for
these private institutions is some-
thing you had to resort to. It's some-
thing that has come upon you
anew. But, this just simply isn’t
so. This was part of a plan from
day one. And, if it should ever fail
to be part of the plan then you
would have negated one of the
primary definitions of an _ inde-
pendent, private school. | think that
is important for us all to remember.

Ring-tum Phi: [| would like to
know why the Development Office
has been so slow in funding the
new gymnasium? As | understand,
the payment has not been com-
pleted.

Hotchkiss: Well that is a good
question, and one that has a very
interesting answer. Washington and
Lee has been for the past two
years or more now under the
direction of John Stemmons (trustee
from Dallas, Texas), who is making
very, very thorough and extensive
plans for the university's compara-
tively long-run future. There is no
doubt whatsoever that Washington
and Lee must have in the next few
yeats some new buildings on this
campus and a greatly increased en
dowment. You don't grab these
things out of the air, and when you
put the university in the position of
asking for help that is very, very
large in its dimension, you want to
be sure that you are absolutely cor-
rect in your assessment of what
your needs really are.

What happened, though, in re-
gard to the gymnasium, was that
there was absolutely no disagree-
ment whatsoever that the gymnasium
was something that the school had
to have. Added to that from an
architectural standpoint, there also
was no problem whatsoever in how
to bring about the desired result.
lt wasn’t a hard thing to figure out
There was no massive relocation of
buildings involved. It didn't mean
that we had to swap any facilities
So for all of the physical reasons,
and for all of the planning reasons,
it seemed that the gymnasium in-
deed was a facility that we need
not wail to go ahead with, if we
could raise the requisite amount of
money. The gymnasium is an ex-
pensive facility: it is a $3,000,000
facility.

Washington Lee had only
once if its entire history, in an
organized way. tried to raise $3
million and that was in 1949 when
we celebrated our bicentennial. In
1959 and 1960. Washington and
Lee atiempted to raise $2 million
and was successful in doing so, for
mew science facilities and for re
furbishing Reid Hall. So we decid
ed that the gymnasium was some
thing that had been promised the
studenis and the faculty for nearly

Letters To The Editor...

Wreden’s Rebuttal

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

In a letter to the Phi-last week,
Lock Handley asserts that my argu-
ments against a coed W&L could
have been used in 1965 to argue
against admitting blacks to a lily-
white school, Then he asks: “How
is sexual segregation different from
racial segregation?

In my opinion, my arguments
could not have been used in 1965
because the reasons Washington
and Lee stayed all-white and the
reasons W&L remains all-male are
completely different. There is a big
difference between racial and sexual
segregation,

Washington and Lee had moral
responsibility to admit blacks in the
mid-sixties. Blacks needed and de-
served as many opportunities to at-
tend quality academic institutions in
the South as whites did, and W&L
opening its doors gave blacks that
needed extra opportunity.

This school has no similar moral
responsibility to admit girls. Again,
if someone wants to go to a coed
school, he has more than enough
opportunity and choices already. It
is one thing to admit blacks to give
then a needed educational oppor-
tunity in the South; it is another
to become the one hundred thous-
andth school to admit girls.

I suspect that W&L remained
all-white mainly because of reg-
ional practices and prejudices, not
because of worry about alumni do-
nations or a desire to provide an
all-white haven, If this school had
been in another part of the country,
undoubtedly it would have admitted
blacks long before it did .

Washington and Lee has remain-
ed all-male because of tradition and
a desire to offer a high quality
choice. Despite this school’s baud-
able tendency to view traditions
with a critical eye, | believe that
WAL would be all-male in any part
of the country today.

Racial segregation is different
from sexual segregation, Racial
segregation is based upon a feeling

that one race is superior to another.
No one defends sexual segregation
by arguing that females are superior
to males or vice versa. Racial
segregation is based on fear of
some sort, No single-sex institution
keeps the other sex out because
they are afraid of them or use terror
tactics to make them want to stay
out. Racial segregation is usually
set up by one part of society to
avoid competition from another seg-
ment. No one contends that an insti-
tution should remain single-sex in
order to avoid competition, aca-
demic or otherwise, from the op-
posite sex,

After noting the differences be-
tween the two, can one still argue
that sexual segregation is the same
as racial segregation and therefore
just as odious?

Kurt Krumperman, in another
letter to the Phi last week, said
WAL is not living up to its educa-
tional philosophy because it is not
admitting girls. He said, “What it
would mean (W&L going coed) is
that at last Washington and Lee
will begin to practice that philo-
sophy, The exclusion of women as
a group contradicts the emphasis
we put on the individual, It contra-
dicts our interest in learning and
understanding when we intention-
ally restrict women from participat-
ing in the learning environment.”

Krumperman seems to think ad-
mitting girls would magically trans-
form Washington and Lee into an
intellectual Utopia. And until this
school admits girls, W&L will re-
main a closed institution not really
interested in individual emphasis
and intellectual achievement.

I disagree. Washington and Lee
does dedicate “all of its resources
to the development of man’s ca-
pacity and desire to learn” and
would hopefully continue to do so
if the school goes coed, Being all-
male has not put a stranglehold on

intellectual creativity or achieve-
ment,
Somehow, | do not understand

how the exclusion of women as a
group contradicts W&L's emphasis

on the individual. Individual em-
phasis is a person-to-person affair,
and should be affected very little
by outside groups, whether exclud-
ed or not,

I also do not understand Lock
Handley’s comment that W&L is
“a type of ‘game preserve’ for male
chauvinism.” Chauvinism is an ex-
aggerated loyalty to a cause, and
I don't feel that most W&L students
are devoted to the creed of male
superiority because they go to an
all-male school,

I am not against coeducation per
se; | am just against a coed W&L
tll more compelling arguments are
presented other than sexual segrega-
tion is just like racial segregation
or W&L can bloom intellectually
only if girls are admitted,

A final note: If Washington and
Lee does go coed, it should not
expand its enrollment to 1800, The
administration should avoid — the
overwhelming temptation to get
more money by packing a few extra
students in one class, a few more
in another. Quality education can
never be measured by the number
of students in a classroom.

Lack of Spirit Lamented

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:
I read Lex McMillan’s article last
week with both head-nodding ap-
proval, and teary-eyed sadness.
Though the new Doremus is a great
benefit to the students and the
Athletic Department, I think I share
a feeling with many when I re-
member the weeknight varsity bas-
ketball games in Old Doremus. The
spacious new gym lacks the ca-
pacity for burning tempers and
effective shouting and harassing
which were so characteristic of the
old gym. The close quarters of
Old Doremus brought everyone
present together, so much so that
some teams refused to come to
Lexington to play. That was spirit.
However, listen for a moment at
our next game, and see if it doesn't
sound like a wrestling match which
you might see on television. It's a
new era in basketball. I wish some-
one would turn up the heat in the

new wing.

Clarification Given

lo the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

In view of misunderstandings that
have arisen from my letter of last
week regarding coeducation, | would
like to underline the fact that I
in no way agree with the views
expressed in quotation marks as to
the disadvantages of racial integra-
tion. To the extent that the letter
may be read as perpetuating a
stereotyped image of Black people,
| am extremely sorry that it was
ever published. Nor did I mean to

Black History Week

This week is celebrated through-
out the nation as “Black History
Week.” Although some individual
schools and so-called leaders of the
people still do not understand the
relevance of Black history, there
are some who feel that this is the
time for Americans to recognize the
real Black American and praise him
for his contributions to the world.

| have decided to devote this
week's article to my fellow Black
brothers and sisters who still may
be indoctrinated with old definition
of “liberty and freedom for all.”

My Dear Black Brothers and Sisters.

First. | ask you to forgive your
mother and father for telling you
to “always turn the other cheek,”
They thought that they were doing
it for your well being. | can not
foliow the old be passive and wait
upon the Lord advice while I look
around and see that for over three
centuries Black people have been
subjugated simply because they were
thought to have the wrong skin
color. | can not follow teachings
of that nature while I look around
and see my Indian brother excluded
from society, The Indian was the

first one here on this land bui
yet remains the last to be cared
about

Brothers, did you know that the
Indian has the highest suicide rate
among teenagers of any racial group
in America’ Did vou know that the
Indian has the highest infant mor-
tality of any racial group in
America’? Finally, did you know
that the American government, a
sovernment that is assumed to he
conceived in liberty and dedicated
io the proposition that all men are

Indian brothers on a

created equal holds your

reservation’

imply that the discrimination which
besets women in our society is as
serious a problem as that with
which Blacks are faced.

A Glorious Experience

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Previously, | was not disposed to
regard coeducation at W&L with a
moral perspective, but after read-
ing those most profound letters
from last week's publication, I be-
gan to really see the light. It was
this glorious experience of finally
having the truth revealed which
has inspired me to confess my
“sexist” iniquities and lay bare my
prejudices for the benefit of future
posterity.

What is the truth, you say? Kate
Millet, in her “divine” wisdom, has
told us that American society is so
constituted, and American politics
so structured as to completely ex-
clude women from any meaningful
chance to participate in the work-
ings of our system. And of course
we as students ought to realize that
this university is but an arm of
this “male Chauvinist” system of
ours, It is “self-evident” then, that
only through coeducation can our
salvation be attained and those ideals
for which this university exists be
realized,

But it is also “self-evident” that
this virtuous crusade cannot be al-
lowed to stop here. For if it is the
society which is the source of this
intolerable evil, then our egalitarian
effort should “and of right ought
to be” directed against it. I have
it from the highest authority (i.c.
Betty Friedan in The Feminine
Mystique) that a quasi-conspiracy
exists among major advertising
agencies, “women’s magazines,” and
the media for the purpose of pro-
gramming women to accept the sub-
missive, family-oriented role within
society, and to look upon herself as
inferior in abilities and desires to
men, It is all so very clear to me
now.

| realize how totally irrelevant
the family, as an institution, is in
present day society. How could any
self-respecting women possibly re-
gard such prehistoric concepts as the
family, the home, and children to
be the only things of importance for
her life. How can one not recognize
the degrading condition which our
male-dominated society imposes
upon every female through _ its
sinister tools of “sexual segrega-
tion,” “unisexual universities,” career
stagnation, economic-political en-
slavement, men’s clubs, fraternities,
Playboy clubs, beauty contests, TV
quiz shows, soap operas, bras,
girdles, cross-word puzzles, bridge
games, the fiendish typewriter, the
library, and many more items and
activities which ruthlessly attempt to
establish a rigid framework in which

his is just a glimpse of the few
unjust practices by a government
and an institutional system which
considers itself just. In paraphras-
ing the words of a political theorist,
man is free, but everywhere we
look we find him in chains.

Brothers and sisters. you may
consider yourself the new breed of
“Black Awareness.” Sometimes
when you are approached by some-
one of the opposite race, you may
go into your bag and come out
someday truculent and brutish be-
cause you do not want any one to
consider you a softie, | think it my
duty to remind you that your grand-
mother and grandfather were re
calcitrant sometimes, It is beneficial
sometimes and also harmful some
times, This recalcirant attitude to
others may be something you and
your grandparents have in common,
but now your grandparents are
dead, Their bodies may be alive
physically, but spiritually they are
dead as a nail.

Your grandparents believed some
thing which I hope you will never
come to think of as almost or
possibly being right. Deep down
inside and af the bottom of their
hearts, your grandparents believed
what the white people of America
said about him. Now, can you see
why the white people rever Booker
tT. Washineton but detest Marcus
Garvey, Angela Davis and Mal
com X? I assume that you are of
no part of the holiness men like
Booker T. Washington, but are of
another time and era.

Brothers and sisters, the primary
goal of your lives should be learn.
ing how to listen for yourself, to
see for yourself and to think for
yourself. Tf you follow this patiern

Through A

   

Spyglass D

  

By MARC JAMES SMALL

The greatest single cause in the
collapse of the American educa-
tional system has been the mania
of educators to convert their col-
leges and universities from places
of learning to hotbeds of “social
engineering.” By thus shifting the
emphasis from education of the
mind to the moral character of an
individual, they have not only sacri-
ficed the intelligence of a nation
and a civilization but have as well
taken upon themselves a_ senseless
and impossible task whose only out-
come will be the thorough confu-
sion and illiteracy of a generation
or more of those who should be
leading this nation.

We have suffered this change
here at Washington and Lee, It
was not too many years ago that
this school had a student body com-
prised almost entirely of what is
now derogatorily referred to as
“homogeneous” body. Yet, this
homogeneity was not, in itself, an
evil, for it formed a student body
which could work together  effici-
ently and avoid those tensions we
are now suffering. It allowed the
Honor System to be maintained.

Most importantly, it did these
things without harming the educa-
tional processes and upsetting the
very purpose for which Washington
and Lee exists, In spite of this, we
have abandoned this principle and
now are drawing into the student
body students who are unable to
work together and who have be-
tween themselves tensions that, if
not soon checked, might destroy
W&L as a serious institution of
higher learning.

Even as I write this, proposals

are being considered that would ex-
pand Washington and Lee’s student
body to two thousand. We have
been suffering the pangs of ex-
pansion ever since World War II:
space has become a premium, we
lack classrooms, library space, and,
perhaps the most irritating, we have
a drastic parking problem. Any
further expansion of the student
body would only aggravate these
already-crucial problems without
bringing into the school any benefits.
Even with the new construction
being considered — which would,
in most cases, only accomodate
current needs — we would still be
terribly overcrowded. At the same
time, such expansion would have
adverse effects on the education
offered here, for it would lower the
faculty-to-student ratio and would
put us well on the way toward be-
coming another “diploma mill.”
The faddishness of the academic
world is sometimes beyond belief.
Why should this school sacrifice
time-honored and proven principles
only to become but one out of
many nameless, faceless, and bland
schools? Is it not enough that we
are what we are? It it not enough
that this school has its own unique
and particular identity which no
other school has? Is it not enough
that W&L offers an education mark-
ed by its high quality and close
faculty-student ties? Why should
we sacrifice all that we now have
for the nebulous and all-too-typical
mediocrity of many other schols?
The unique quality of education at
Washington and Lee is its own de-
fense: we have little to gain but
much to lose by attempting poorly-
considered and ill-advised changes.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Generals Fall To R-M, Trounce
York; Season Record Now 13-7

By PALMER TRICE

If we had to do it over again,
we'd do it exactly the same way.”
The Generals four point loss to
Randolph-Macon was a__heart-
breaker. In most ball games, it’s
impossible to point out turning
points, but in this one, Coach Verne
Canfield) pointed out five errors
committed by the Generals as being
the keys to the contest. The five
included two turnovers, a
blocked shot, and a pair of de-
fensive errors. Otherwise, the game
was one of the best played games
by the Blue team of the year.

Wednesday night’s visit to Ran-
dolph-Macon was a particularly im-
portant road trip for the W&L B-
ballers. Several goals were on the
line, among them being the chances
for a twenty win season, a win at
Macon, and a big in-state victory
fhe Generals were “up” for the
game. Though they trailed by as
many as eight in the first half, they
refused to quit. Down 24-16 with
five minutes remaining in the first
half, the Blue closed to within four
at the half, 35-31.

The Generals faced a_ tough,
physical Yellow Jacket defense, and
handled it well. The Yellow Jacket
defense included a new twist—a
double or triple team on Mike
Daniel. The tactic succeeded in hold-
ing the leading scorer to only 14
points, far below his season's aver-

errors

Seniors To

Five senior players will be honor-
ed Saturday night during their last
regular season home basketball game
at Washington and Lee.

rhe five are forward Mike Daniel
of Cincinnati; center John Glace of
Carlisle, Pa.; and guards Ellie
Gutshal lof Elkins, W. Va., Dave
Stone of Chicago and Scott Wood
of Chatham, N. Y.

Daniel, the team captain and
leading scorer with a 24.0 average,
has played regularly since his fresh-
man year, and currently ranks fifth

age. Paul McClure responded with
19 points and 9 rebounds, Skip
Lichtfuss added 18 points.

With 11:37 remaining, the Gen-
erals took the lead for the first time
in the ball game, 47-46, but this
did not last long. With 2:52 re-
maining, the Yellow Jackets boosted
their lead to five on a fast break.
A McClure jumper pulled the Gen-
erals to within three, 68-65, but the
Jackets ran it back up to five. With
1:30 remaining, McClure once again
brought the Blue to within three.
A Skip Lictfuss jumper at the 1:07
mark brought them to within one.
70-69. With 25 seconds remaining.
Lichtfuss stole a pass from Dennis
Howard. The Generals ran the clock
down to the :12 second mark. The
ball went inside to Daniel, who put
up a lay-up. It rimmed in and out.
Dennis Howard was fouled on the
rebound. He made his first. try,
missed the second, but came up
with the rebound, He was fouled
by Doug Clelan with eight seconds
left. and sank both free throws,
which accounted for the final 73-
69 margin. It was a disappointing
loss, as the team played well. Coach
Canfield failed once again to win
at Randolph-Macon, and hopes of
a twenty game season were dashed,

Saturday night's seven o'clock
contest with York College was not
much of a contest. The Generals
played everyone, and came up with

Be Honored

on the all-time list of W&L scorers
with 1,514 career points. He needs
only 48 points in his remaining six
games to rise to fourth on the
list. The all-time scorers are Dom
Flora 2,310, Jan Handlan 2,002,
Mel Cartwright 1,800 and Lee Mar-
shall 1,561.

Glace, Gutshall and Stone also
have been regulars since their fresh-
men years and have frequently start-
ed for the Generals. Wood sat
out last year and has been used
only sparingly this year.

an impressive 92-62 victory, Except
for the early goings, the Generals
dominated the contest on both ends
of the court. The Blue used their
height to good advantage, as they
ran and ran and ran. Paul Me-
Clure had an outstanding night,
as he tallied 24 points and 12 re-
bounds. The Generals used a wide
variety of defenses, including sev-
eral presses, the matchup, and the
man for man, Thanks in a large
part to the number of easy shots
taken at the end of the fast break,
the Blue shot an excellent 51%.

Thursday, the Generals travel to
Dickinson College, in Carlisle, Penn-
sylvania. Dickinson has a 12-5 rec-
ord, the Blue, a 13-7 record, Satur-
day night’s contest with Davis and
Elkins College will be the final
regular season appearance for this
year’s seniors. A program will be
held at some time during the eve-
ning in their honor,

If the Blue can close fast, a
post-season tourney berth might be
possible. The CAC Tourney is com-
ing soon, and it should be tougher
than usual, The word is that Se-
wanee has a 7-footer,

Coach Bill Stearns of the swim-
ming teams says, “We could do
better in the state and conference
meets. We have several individuals
who show up better in big meets.”
The swimmers have a record of
4-6, the first losing season since the
1940's,

The freshmen basketball squad
has been called “The finest since
I've been here,” by the coach Tom
Davies. Davies has guided the frosh
for five seasons. Three major col-
lege opponents have met the Baby
Blue: Virginia, VMI, and Navy. The
squad's record is now 9-2 with a
pair of contests left on the schedule.

“Eight or nine players could make
the varsity next year,” Davies add-
ed. “Six will, for sure.”

Stu. Nibley continues to be the
big gun for the rookie team. He
leads the team in assists, field goal
percentage and points-per-game at
20.7. Guy Kerr is hitting at a 12.1
point clip and has more steals in
11 games than any freshman team
player has compiled in recent mem-
ory. Guy is third in rebounds and
second in assists, Randy Taylor is
the top rebounder for the frosh
although he has suffered from a
foot injury. Burr Datz has been
credited by Davies for fine “clutch
performances,”

Senior Captain Mike Daniels takes a 24 point average into Saturday’s last home game against Davis and Elkins

Daniel, along with four other seniors, will be honored at halftime,

WRESTLING STATISTICS

Duncan DeGraff continues to
lead the W&L grapplers in statistics.
Duncan has 36 team points to his
credit, the team high mark. His
record in competition is also. best
for the squad—seven wins and two
losses. In his nine matches DeGraff

Coach Verne Canfield’s team its
sixth straight winning season. In
the past five years W&L has posted
season records of 20-5, 19-6, 18-5,
17-8, and 17-8, and currently stands
13-7 with six games remaining.

It will be a homecoming of
sorts for two W&L cagers,  start-
ing guard Doug Clelan of Harris-
burg, Pa. and key reserve center
John Glace of Carlisle. Clelan is
scoring at 7.6-per-game clip, and
is threatening to break the all-time
season record for assists, set by Mel
Cartwright two years ago. To date,
Clelan has 90 assists, and needs
just slightly more than five in each
of the remaining games to_ break
Cartwright’s mark of 120,

Glace is the fifth-leading scorer
for the Generals with a 6.6-mark,
and also is fifth in rebounds with

53 for the year. He has frequently
started for W&L in his four years
on the varsity.

WAL ended its only losing streak
at two last Saturday night with a
92-62 breeze over another Penn-
sylvania team, York College. Prior
to that, the Generals had been in-

volved in four straight close ball
games with Virginia opponents,

winning the first two but dropping
the last pair.

The Generals edged Hampden-
Sydney, 78-75 in overtime, then re-

one of his patented driving layups
with 12 seconds. left. that would
have given W&L a one-point lead.
Daniel continues to pace the Gen-
erals with a 24.0 scoring average,
despite relatively low-scoring efforts
(14 and 18 points) in the last two
outings. Sophomore Skip Lichtfuss
is averaging 15.6 points a game, and
6-8 junior Doug McClure is scor-
ing at a 12.8 pace and. is the
leading rebounder with 11 per game.
After Dickinson Thursday night,
the Generals return for their final
regular season home game Saturday
night against Davis & Elkins.

Tankers Close
Season at 4-6

Washington and Lee's swimming
team closed out its regular season
last weekend, dropping. decisions to
two major opponents, Virginia and
Duke.

The swimmers of Coach Bill
Stearns lost to the Cavaliers by a
72-41 score Friday night, and to
the Blue Devils on Saturday after-
noon, 73-40,

The Generals will participate next

VMI, then defend their College
Athletic Conference championship
the following weekend at Centre
College in Kentucky.

Next comes the national college
division championships March 16-
18 in W&L’s new 75-foot pool.
Bim Clark has already qualified for
the nationals, in the 50-yard free-
style.

Honor System:
Weekly Report

(Continued from page 1)
justice a case may be reheard by
the Honor Council
In response to our questions on

ome issues that directly relate to

the situation here at W&L, repre
sentatives of UVa said that they
have not observed any weakening of

their honor system which they can
attribute solely to the increase in
ive of their student body, Nor have
they seen any ill effects on the
honor system resulting directly from
the presence of women within the
student body

The interview at the University
of Virginia leads us to the final and
most important phase of the honor
system study—that phase which di
ctly involves the W&L_ student
body itself, Next Wednesday, Febru
ary 23, questionnaires concerning
the honor system will be available
in the Co-op for students to fill out
Also. on Wednesday and Thursday
from four o'clock to six o'clock
members of the study group. will
be in Room 208 of the Student
Center to listen to any students who

sh to make comments or express
opinions concerning the honor sys
tem. And finally, a random sample
poll of student opinion will be con
ducted next week, hopefully leading
toward an accurate notion of what
WAL students today feel about the

honor system

He pointed out that the Mock

W&L Opens $56 Million Development Drive

President Robert E. R. Huntley
announced a $56 million university-
wide development program for the
1970's during the Founder's Day
Convocation yesterday. According to
Mr. Huntley, $36 million should be
raised by 1976. This program consti-
tutes the largest undertaking of its
kind by a school of W&L’s size.

Also taking part in the develop
ment announcement were two trus-
tees: Dr. John Newton Thomas of
Richmond, rector of the board of
trustees and John M. Stemmons of
Dallas, chairman of the “Achieve-
ment Council.”

Dr. Thomas told the audience in
Doremus Gymnasium that over $9.2
million had already been acquired
toward the goal, with the board of
trustees unanimously pitching in for
a total of $2.5 million.

The total figure of $56 million
can be broken down into three ma-
jor categories. First, $24 million in
new endowment funds will be rais
ed, Second is $24 million for con-
struction and major renovations,

The remaining $8 million is to sup-
port the academic programs through

|

the annual Alumni and Parents’
Funds,

Two new buildings will be con-
structed, a School of Law, and an
undergraduate library, The law
school wil Icost about $7 million;
the library is price tagged at $5.25
million,

In his speech President Huntley
asked his fellow institution members
to “recommit ourselves to the
future.”

Before announcing the scope of
the development plan, the president
outlined some of the “general
premises” that guided the two year
study involved with the project.
Huntley said, “the university should
remain small.” Although this idea
was considered relative, he said that
for W&L size was also an absolute
concept,

“The University will need to main-
tain and enhance its long standing
commitment to the premise that the
best in liberal education and the
best in professional or pre-profes
sional education can and should be
combined at Washington and
Huntley added, “There is

Lec,”
no di-

 

President Huntley: “Never has W&L sought to solve its needs a decade
in advance and never so seriously pursued such a goal.”

chotomy between them but rather
each re-enforces the other and they
become inextricably interwoven to
the enhancement of both. Therefore,
the depth and scope of Washington
and Lee’s curriculum must be re-
tained,”

Next Huntley turned to the busi
ness of graduate schools. “Washing
ton and Lee will not in all likehood
wish to add further graduate pro-
grams, but will strive to do its thing
in the best possible way.”

The President added that “the
faculty, which this university has
attracted is its greatest single

strength. The faculty must be large
enough to create the opportunity for
close relationships with the students
and with each other, must have the

capacity, the training and the in-
tegrity to act as the intelelctual
stimulus to the campus and must

be dedicated to the conviction that

Hotchkiss Talks
In The Cockpit

The W&L alumni have challenged
the student body to raise funds for
University. The alumni promise to
put up three dollars for every one
dollar donated by the students. Stu-
dents may respond to the chal-
lenge in the Co-op.

This concept of gaining monetary
support for the school came out of
the Alumni Conference this winter.
Alumni felt this approach might
encourage students to acquire the
donation habit early.

With this in mind, the Executive
Committee designated a_ student
“planning and development” com-
mittee to work as a go-between,
the student committee, headed by
Mike McCall, will explain and in-
form the students of the importance
of their future support and explain
how the University is managed.

Starting last Sunday night the
committee began a campaign com-
plete with radio announcements,
posters, tapes and personal contacts,
culminating tonight with an informal
seminar in the Cockpit, Farris
Hotchkiss of the Development
Office will be present. The program

will emphasize the importance of
alumni paritcipation in = school
affairs

The program will be unique for
two reasons according to the com
mittee chairman MeCall. McCall
stated “It is the first such program
organized by students in a Virginia
college and the path of
WAL's educational future may be
guided by the outcome.”

are career objectives which are con-

the greatest measure of personal
satisfaction, We have such a faculty,
we must continue to have it.”

Huntley continued with his “gen-
eral precepts”: “For every area of
the formal curriculum there must

be a selective but rich array of non-
curricular and co-curricular opor-
tunities for our students and faculty
... the university's bold step in the
1950’s to an athletic program, for
all here who wish to avail them-
selves of it, was the right step.”
“The university must have an en-
larged capacity to provide financial
help to students who share Wash-

ington and Lee's philosophy of
education who wish to be a part
of it but who cannot afford to
attend without assistance... fi

nancial integrity and soundness are
essential.”

ment plan include the recent addi-
tion to Doremus Gymnasium cost-
ing $3.2 million.

(called the valley by Mr,
west of its current site in Tucker
Hall. The enrollment of the law
school will rise from 250 to 350
when expansion is complete. The
current floor will increase six-

fold.

The new undergraduate
will be located in the area of the
Washington Annexes and will de-
scend into the ravine. It will be
four times larger than the current
structure. The cost is estimated at
$5.2 million.

When the library is moved out
of McCormick Hall, the Commerce
School will move into that structure.
Huntley commented, “the library.
with major renovation, would

Both the vacated Newcomb and
Fucker Halls will be remodeled and
turned over to undergraduate de
partments that are “tucked in attics”
according to the president.

Ground should be broken within
six months on new unmarried hous
ing in the ravine area. The dormi
tories will be modular in construc-
tion. Around 200 units are sched-
uled for completion by 1976, th
remaining 200 should be finished
by 1979

During his remarks on the con-

stressed a “close-knit community of
buildings,”

An additional $24 million is hop-
ed to be raised for endowment.
Included in this total is increasing
student financial aid by $6 million.
Another $18 million can be spent
to maintain facilities, and continue
other activites such as co-curricular
projects,

The final category of the $56
million campaign total is $8 million
for annual giving

President Huntley claimed that
“never has W&L sought to solve its
needs a decade in advance and
never so seriously pursued such a
goal this is an objective we
must aspire to.”

In his brief remarks, Mr. Stem
mons assured the assembled students
that the board of trustees “is dedi

cated to excel

lence.” Mr. Stemmons drew particu
lar attention to the $8 million in
annual giving. He called it “the

catalyst that keeps this excellence
alive.” The Texas trustee also ela

Athletic Program’s Problems

As a perusal of page thirty-eight
of the Washington and Lee Univer-

looked upon as “an integral part of
the educational program.” That is
to say, the athletic program receives
the consideration of the University
without its becoming the all-im-
portant image-making colossus that
it has become at many large institu
tions of higher learning.

However, the W&L program is
not without its problems. Although

Letters To The Editor...

Gentlemanly Behavior?

To The Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Washington and Lee University
has had the reputation of being a
school where “the conduct of gentie-
men” is expected at all times from
the members of its community.

This past Friday night, I, along
with others, who walked along Jef-
ferson Street on our way to the
Troubadour Theatre’s excellent pro-
duction of “Luther” witnessed a
scene at the Phi Kappa Sigma
House which certainly was not
“gentlemanly” in nature, I question
whether the actions witnessed could
be considered humane. It was the
eve before the formal initiation of
the Class of 1975 pledges into the
house. The scene was one in which
supposedly rational college students
were subjecting fellow supposedly
rational college students to degrada-
tion, Both actives and pledges were
wrong. The actives for initiating
such hazing, and the pledges for
willingly going through it for the
sake of entrance to the house,

The actual scene I witnessed was
a pledge strutting across the street
from the parking lot side of Jef-
ferson and up the stairs mimicking
a duck the whole time. He was then
subject to a douse of cold water
from a third floor window—this
while it is snowing and the pledge
clad in a t-shirt. He was then swatted
up to the door where he begged
pounded and hollered “hellos and
yes sirs” to gain admittance to the
foyer. From that point the passer-
by can only surmise as to what
next falls upon the victim.

This type of severe hazing is
not restricted to just one or two
houses but is typical of the fratern-
ity system. Some say they enjoy
it and cite it as an “example of
brotherhood” and “an experience
worth going through.” I, and I am
sure others do also, find such state-
ments a poor justification when the
goal of “brotherhood” can be pro-
moted in a more constructive way.

Should any one person be subject
to such physical abuse in order to
have the opportunity to join to-

gether in a_ social-living arrange-
ment? | say no, Certainly there
will always be some hazing,. but let
it be in a less sever manner, Pro-
mote the desired comradship through
group social, service, and athletic
activities rather than degradation
and fear currently used. The end
result will be a much more sincere
relationship.

I don’t wish to give the impres-
sion that this letter is aimed at the
Phi Kappa Sigma House, It is not.
Some of the best people on campus
are found among its actives. and
pledges. What I am objecting to is
the approach taken by the fraterni-
ties as a whole. | am asking that
they and the University reevaluate
themselves and the means by which
they reach their desired goals and
that they seek means that are more
civilized and suited to the spirit
of “brotherhood” they espouse.

Unnecessary Frustrations

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

As a member of Students for
Coeducation and as a sincerely con-
cerned student interested in upgrad-
ing the quality of education at
W&L I would like to give one of
many arguments in favor of co-
education. I chose this argument
because it is particularly applicable
to myself and has convinced me
that coeducation is a valuable asset
to a college education. I hope it
will do the same for others.

Because W&L is an all male
school, students cannot relate prop-
erly to women. We can not get to
know women. Almost the only con-
tact we have with women is on
dates. For this reason we can't get
to know attitudes, emotions and
feelings a woman has at different
times. Furthermore, segregation of
the sexes is an unnatural thing and
should be avoided. Men and women
are meant to live together. This is
one of the few natural laws I
believe in. Separation leads to un-
necessary frustrations.

Like everybody tells us, the col-

Studied In Law Course
Juvenile Justice System

During the past semester at the
Law School, twelve second and
third year law students were en-
rolled in a new course designed to
study the juvenile justice system.
The Juvenile Justice Workshop was
conceived by and conducted under
the auspices of Professor Wifred
J. Ritz in an effort to provide an
overall view of all aspects of the
juvenile justice process.

The need for study in this field
is revealed by the alarming statistics
concerning youthful offenders, For
example, violent crime by children
increased 148 percent during the

1960's; persons under 25 account
for over 59 percent of the crimes

By LEX McMILLAN

The Ring-tum Phi is one of the
favorite objects of criticism for the
student body, It is accused of being,
one-sided, poorly written, grammati-
cally weak and full of errors, These
are impressive charges and in many
instances they are correct. Indeed,
oftentimes the “Phi” is boring. This
might be a result of the fact that
WAL is boring; it is you know.
The only really “un-boring” sort of
things that go on here are intel-
lectual and academic. | would wager
that if the “Phi” devoted itself
exclusively to the intellectual and
academic there really would be an
outraged student body (e.g., We get
enough of that in class.) After all,
most W&L men don't come here
for enlightement. They come for
social advancement, potential job
security, freedom to choose a lucra-
tive position in the “real world”
and of course because “it’s the thing
to do.”

In regard to the charge of “one-
sidedness,” | can only say that this
is not intentional (it it exists.) It is
very easy to get your opinion ex-
pressed in the “Phi”. Letters to the
Editor are always encouraged and
special column space is frequently
provided for students who are not
even staff members. If the “Phi” is
one-sided it is because of students
being more enamored with idle
criticism than with active efforts to
change the situation,

In fact, considering the stagger-
ingly large number of high school
newspaper editors and writers that
enter W&L each year, I am sure
that the “Phi” could be an extra-
ordinary college newspaper. We have
the talent, but it goes wasted and is
merely reflected in the authoritative
mumblings of those who can tell
you how to do it but don't have
the necessary qualities that would
enable them to do it themselves.

The other criticisms which I men-
tioned above and any others that I
can think of could be eliminated if
those who have the talent would
step forward, In other words, “Put
up or shut up.”

Well the above shouldn't be a very
earth-shaking revelation, It is the
obvious solution. For a long time
the handful of dedicated souls that
grind out the “Phi” every week
have hoped that their sad smallness
would be someday supplemented
by a journalistic renaissance. (Please
don't accuse me of self-adulation in
the above comment about the “de-
dicated souls”.) | readily exclude
myself from that group, All 1 do
is sit down a couple of times a
month and relieve some inner ten-
sions, This is not too difficult and
it's fun. There is a formidable num-
ber of other activities which consti-
tute the assembling of a newspaper.
| help with none of them.

The other solution is the appear-
ance of a completely independent
competing newspaper. We used to
have two “Phi's” but their relation
was not as much competitive as it
was symbolic, They existed to an-
tagonize one another and indulge in
petty back-biting. Fortunately these
two mirrored images became a

specter,
But now an alternative has ap-
peared (so they say) With im-

measurable audacity The Tango has
arrived, billing itself as the al-
ternative to the “Phi.” When I
heard of the upcoming appearance
of this “journalistic endeavor,” |
was rather impressed and enthused.
The idea of a competing forum to
raise the quality of student journ-
alism is an excellent one, However,
having read as much of The Tango
as | could stomach Owhich was al-
most all; | have a very strong
stomach) | turned from it with a
mixture of negative emotions. In-
deed, | hardly know where to start,
| feel somewhat embarrassed that
such an incredibly puerile combina-
tion of nonsense and bad taste
could have been produced by Wash-
ington and Lee students. Particularly
offensive is the blasphemous and
tasteless story concerning the cir-
cumstances of the birth of Christ
In addition, the story by the

“Letting Go’

anonymous Hollins coed is not only
a gross exaggeration but also a
rather poor reflection of the men-
tality of the writer (if the writer
was a Hollins’ coed at all),

I could continue but I think few
will have difficulty in realizing the
multitudinous deficiencies of this in-
sult to the campus public. (1 hope
this abortive attempt at cuteness
will not reach any public outside
of the Washington and Lee com-
munity. After all, we are used to
excesses, but the general public
might rise up in arms,

The real danger that I see is ad-
dressing myself to this subject at
all is that the producers of The
Tango can simply fall comfortably
back on their own insubstantiality
and claim that my very criticism
is what they intended, Their self-
proclaimed “daringly existentialist
(sic)” format was meant to be every-
thing I condemn it for. Yuk, Yuk.
Well, if that is the case then my
condemnation is doubled because
their insult is premeditated rather
than the product of an inexperienc-
ed first try at humor and satire.
(1 would like to think the latter.)

Either way the spectacle is
affrontive to the dignity, the intelli-
gence and the reputation of Wash-
ington and Lee. The Tango is not
supported by school funds, It is an
independent profit-making venture.
You can vote for its demise by
the simplest democratic means avail-
able: don’t buy it!

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

enerals End 15-8 Season;
AC Tournament

By PALMER TRICE

With only one week remaining
in the 1971-72 basketball season,
one can only look back at the
season as a successful one, The
Generals have assured themselves of
another winning season, Their rec-
ord of 15-8 is certainly nothing to
be ashamed of, especially if one
considers the fact that this team
played without the obvious advant-
ges of Old Doremus, and the fact
that the 1971-72 club played one
of the toughest schedules lined up by
this university. The Blue have been
an exciting team, having lost and
won many squeakers.

Ihe Generals entered this week
wiih one goal: to win the rest of
their games. If they could do this,
they held a chance of obtaining an
NCAA bid for the post-season
tournament. Last Thursday, the
Blue traveled to Carlisle, Pennsyl-
vania, to take on the outstanding
Dickinson College hoopers. In what
seems to be the usual General
they fell behind early. At
one point in the first half, Dickin-
son led by as much as 11, They
were being led mostly by Frank
“The Gnat” Noonan. The Blue
closed to five at the half.

the Generals charged out in the

fashion,

second half, and tied the score at

44, with 14:50 left in the game.
Mike Daniel gave the Blue their
first lead on a three point play.

With 10:56 left in regulation, W&L
led by 50-48. With fifty-nine sec-
onds left in regulation, Skip Licht-
fuss put the Blue up by seven. Led
by the 5°3° Noonan, Dickinson tied
the score on a last second shot,
70-70, W&L jumped to an early
lead in the five minute overtime,
and maintained it. The lead was
eight at one time, but it dwindled
to the final 80-76 score.

Little can be said about the
Davis and Elkins game. The final
99-68 score speaks for itself. Every-
one played, and just about every-
one scored. The contest was in
honor of the five graduating seniors,
who were presented with honorary
certificates before the game. Mike
Daniel had 23 points, John Glace,
17 points, Ellie Gutshall, 10 points,
and Dave Stone, 8 points, Tall
Paul McClure had 14 points and
14 rebounds. Mike Daniel's 23
points pushed him up to fourth on
the all-time list of W&L scorers,

Monday night, the Generals
traveled to Belmont-Abbey. The
close ones caught up with them

again, The regular season finale was

a tough loss to take. The Blue
dropped a 73-71 decision, Once
again, the Generals fell behind

early, They trailed by as many as
11 in the first half, but managed
to gain a tie at the half, 38-38. In
the second half, the Generals open-
ed up quickly. They opened up five
point leads on three separate oc-
casions. But with 1:25 left, Bel-
mont-Abbey led by 71-69. They
made two foul shots, to match the
Blue’s basket.

Belmont-Abbey was a_ running
team, They made more turnovers
than the Blue, but managed to over-
come them, Mike Daniel had 24
points and 9 rebounds, while Paul
McClure had 9 points and 17 re-
bounds. Skip Lichtfuss had 18 points
and 10 rebounds. The Generals
three man show wasn't enough to
overcome a Belmont-Abbey team
effort.

The Generals carry a 15-8 record
into the C.A.C, Tournament this
weekend. The round robin format
could hurt the Blue’s chances, al-
though they still should be the
favorite. Too bad about _ the
NCAA's, but better a bridesmaid
than nothing at all.

Wrestlers Reach .500

Washington and Lee has its first
500 wrestling team since 1964-65
when the Generals went 7-3-1. So
far the Blue has a 6-6-1 mark at
the conclusion on the regular sea-
son, The CAC tournament remains
to be completed this weekend.

The grapplers have pulled off
three straight wins: 45-6 against
Lynchburg, 41-9 against Galluadet,
and 24-16 against Hampden-Sydney.

Duncan DeGraff has continued to
lead the squad with a 10-2 record,
consisting of six pins and 42 team
points. Rick Marsh at 126 pounds
has turned his trend around and
won four straight matches by pins,
after losing his first four clashes.

Concerning the CAC tournament,
Coach John Piper says, “We're more
of a competitor than last year.”
The team finished second last winter
in the annual championships.

Next year should be just as

promising according to Piper, Only
one senior will be lost through

supposedly, the recruiting is com-

As the wrestling program said

be as great. Misunderstanding re-

would get to see a girl in dif-

Twelve Law Students Explore
Virginia Juvenile Justice System

(Continued from page 3)
of violence each year; the recidiv-
ism rate for juveniles is nearly
75 percent, which is higher than
the rate for adult criminals.

In attempting to discern the par-
ticular problems involved in the
juvenile justice system, the course
has eschewed the traditional lecture
and case book approach. In addi-
tion to basic reading assignments,
the course has utilized field trips
to juvenile detention and
tional facilities, individual student
attendance at juvenile court pro-
ceedings throughout the State, and
on-campus panel discussions with
authorities in the field.

corree-

The various field trips have in-
cluded tours of the new and ex-
perimental Robert F. Kennedy
Youth Center in Morgantown, West
Virginia, the Beaumont School for
Boys, the Bon Air School for Girls,

the Petersburg Federal Reforma-
tory, and several other facilities
concerned with juvenile correction
and rehabilitation. The visits by

Workshop members included not
only an inspection of the physical
plant, but also a question and
answer period with the administra-
tors.

Although some institutions were
more progressive and better equip-
ped than others, the emphasis at
all the juvenile facilities was re
habilitative rather than punitive and
custodial, For example, most do not
have fences, guards, lock-up facili-
ties, etc. At some, tours were
partially conducted by members of
the institution's population, thus
affording uninhibited answers to

some pointed questions regarding

Guest authorities for on-campus
panel discussions have been interest-
ing and quite varied in their in-
volvement with juvenile programs.
They have included, among others,
Frank Kelly, Director, Governor's
Council on Narcotics and Drug
Abuse Control; Carroll Minor, Di-
rector, Division of Youth Services,
Virginia Department of Welfare and
Institutions; Judge Lawrence L.
Koontz, Juvenile and Domestic Re-
lations Court, City of Roanoke, and
other law enforcement and admini-
strative officials involved with juve-
niles. All panel discussions empha-
size spontaneity and permit each
student the pursue the specific area
that holds the most interest for
him,

Juvenile justice is a many faceted
problem with few, if any, clear
answers. Workshop members have
found the topic both interesting and
timely and the course has provided
an effective, overall view of the
juvenile justice system.

W&L Athletics

(Continued from page 2)

In addition, upper level physical
education courses will become
more sophisticated. A “Care and
Prevention of Athletic Injuries”
course will be offered and will be
complemented by an “Administra-
tion and Physical Education” offer-
ing. Hours have not as yet been
decided. The care and prevention
course may include practice by the

student as a trainer. McHenry em-
phasized that the object of the
academic aspects was to reflect the
changing needs and attitudes of the
students,

These are some of the difficulties
which face the Washington and Lee
University Athletic Department.
They present a challenge to the
philosophy to which the school so
strongly adheres, and yet they are
not so insuperable with the proper
handing. W&L has shown that it
has successfully made the conver-
sion from a_ big-time high-cost
athletics to non-subsidization; it has
sought to improve its athletic physi-
cal plant; it is maintaining an intra-
mural program which Athletic Di-
rector William McHenry calls the
finest he’s seen; it has expanded
academically; and it has grappled
with the perplexing dilemma of
competitive scheduling.

All of this has been conducted
on a financial framework much
smaller than the littlest of big-time
schools. Indeed, the Athletic De-
partment has successfully met every-
one of the recommendations made
to it by the 1964-66 University
Self-Study Report. While the Athle-
tic Department is not without
problems, it is also not without
a desire to solve them,

Elections Are Monday

BY JOHN ZINK
The Executive Committee — last
Monday discussed the up-coming
elections, the controversy over the
Cold Check Committee, and the
plans for a more thorough explana-

tion of the Honor Code to next
vear's Freshman Class, President
Steve Robinson announced — the

names of those persons who had at-
tained the required number of
signatures to be placed on the bal-
lot for the “Big Five” election to
be held next Monday,

The candidates are. for Presi-
dent; Robert Brennan, Rick Gray,
and John Runge; for Vice-President:
Robert Bruyere, Archer Frierson.
and Bill Merrill: for Secretary: Bill
Clark, and Lewis Powell; for Presi-
dent of the Fancy Dress Commit
tee’ Richard Jones. There were no
nominations for the Vice-President
of the Dance Board. Robinson also
announced that all candidates are to
turn in a list of their expenses by
6 p.m. on Sunday, March 5 in the
E.C, room. The failure to turn in
an expense list will result in the
eandidate’s name being dropped
from the ballot.

The campaign expenditure limit
was set at $25 by a motion pro-
posed by Senior Law Representative

Lock Handley at last week’s EC
meeting. At that time JoJo Mar-
tin. Senior Representative. noted

that a limitation “will bring equity
into the campaign costs.” When the
Handley motion came up for a vote
it was passed by a vote of six to
three.

The controversy which has arisen
over the duties and performance of
the Cold Check Committee was dis-
cussed this week. The Cold Check
Commitiee was called before the
EC in order to work out some of
the difficulties. Chuck Lee. chair-
man of the committee, outlined the
present situation. He said that so
far this year the cammittee has had
from $800 to $900 of bad checks

from about 400 students. Lee also

pointed to the fact that at the begin-
ning of the year, the local mer-
chants believed that the committee

Gee that the Mock Convention
would have to solve problems in
delegate selection that the Demo

Black Professor Speaks

BY PAUL LANCASTER

Dr .Alan Colon. Head of Black
Studies at Virginia State College,
called on blacks to help themselves
if they are to improve Black educa-
tion. His speech Monday night in
Lee Chapel opened the Student As-
soication for Black Unity’s first an-
nual “Black Culture Week” at
Washington and Lee.

Colon opened with “a basic real-
ity... that the black people are op-
pressed with respect to education

and that the education of the
oppressed cannot equal that of the
oppressors.”

He then presented a_ historical
overview of the “educational en-
slavement” of blacks. which began
with the inception of slavery. He
noted that “we've all been trained
io think that Africa is nothing but
sicaming jungles, This is a
poor stereotype.”

Colon suggested instances which

very

“facilitated the machinery of sla-
very. He mentioned laws which
prohibited slave education, based

on the belief that to keep a person
ignorant is to control him. Also.
sirong movements existed which at

Honor Study:

‘Weekly Report’

BY ARCHER FRIERSON
To date, the Honor System Study
Group has reported on its inter-
views of approximately 15 faculty
members and administrators here at
WL, has presented its conversa-
tion with the President of the U.Va.
Hones Council, and has made avail-
able to all students the opportunity
to fill out a special Honor System
questionnaire, the results of which
are now being tabulated. We are
now in the process of completing
the last and most important phase
of our study-—student . interviews;
and we wll have our conclusions
and recommendations made public
before final exams. In order to faci-
litate matters, we would like to en-
courage any student
be interviewed, make comments, or
ask questioas, to drop his name and
phone number in a box that will be
provided on the table located at the
front doors of the Student Center,
This week, two students with first-
hand knowledge of the Honor Sys-
tem, and particularly the procedu-
ral aspects of an honor hearing,
interviewed, The first student,
A, was accused cf a possible honor
violation earlier this year and was
acquitted by the EC at a private
Rearing. The seccad student, “5,”
was also accused of a possible
honor violation this year,
was found guilty by the EC at a pri-
vate but was acquitted by
a ‘tudent jury at a public hearing.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

March 1, 1972

Since Christmas, coed-mania has swept this campus like
an infectious plague. Every winter contemplation of this utopia
seems to be relapsing as the principal indoor sport. This sea-
son, the results are a bit more tangible than ever before.
Actually, the score is coeducationalists 3—~all-male chawvinis-
tic pigs 0.

Three diverse assemblages have endorsed a coeducational
future for Washington and Lee University. These bodies
were the Student Executive Committee, the University Coun-
cil (composed of faculty, students, and administrators) and
the Faculty Committee on Coeducation, The rationale of
this threefold endorsement centers on several arguments:
improving the academic stature of W&L, providing a more
wholesome and natural social environment, insuring an equal
opportunity for women and keeping current with the trends
at prestigious American institutions of higher learning, ¢.g.
Harvard, Princeton and Yale (which have all weleomed coeds
during recent semesters).

During Monday's Big Five Elections—-you, the students,
can make your stand on the issue of coeducation, The Stu-
dent Executive Committee has included on the ballot this
question, “Do you think coeducation is desirabe for Washing-
ton and Lee?” The results from this survey will generate a
concrete measurement of student sentiment on the issue.

Well, now the score is coeducationalists 3—all-male chau-
vinistic pigs 1. The Ring-tum Phi dissents. Coeducation should
not be allowed here; the two-century-old precept needs to be
maintained.

Initially, let it be known that there is no genuine, immmedi-
ate impetus for transforming W&L into a coeducational uni-
versity. Contrary to recent rumors, W&L is not a substand-
ard institution merely because females do not attend on a
regular basis. You may be pleased to hear that the quality of
education is improving here without the presence of women.
If you are unconvinced, investigate the projected consequences
of the $56 million development scheme which soundly pro-
vides for the future of W&L.

Coeducation will be expensive. The Report of the Com-
mittee on Coeducation made estimates of the pecuniary con-
sequences of admitting females. Four different plans were
provided with cost estimates. The total increase in yearly
deficit (amortization cost of capital investment over 20 years
at 81/4 per cent annual interest minus the change in annual
operating budget) ranges from $779,767 to $1,166,659. These
figures are based on November 1969 prices.

Coedueation will certainly affect the admissions picture.
According to Dean of Admissions, James Farrar, the number
of applicants is steadily rising. Coeducation in simple terms
means saying “NO” to more and more of these fine male ap-
plicants. Somebody has to go when an evalanche of women
arrive,

Coeducation infers an inflation in enrollment. The Faculty
Committee Report on Coeducation of 1970 continuously re-
ferred to a planned student body of about 2000. If W&L
swelled to that size, it would greatly endanger the university's
precept of remaining small by choice. Remember that Wash-
ington and Lee's enrollment has dilated from 1400 to 1600
in a fleeting four year period. The forthcoming School of Law,
when it is full, will boost the student population by another
100, making the total around 1700, Does W&L need more
students? One must be dubious. Size sparks the immense dan-
yer of sacrificing the Honor System. One crucial factor that
continues to make our code viable is the close-knit nature of
the student body. The more people that attend here conse-
quentially reduce that virtue of closeness, The expanded en-
rollment that seems to be a part and parcel of most coeduca-
tional schemes, poses a great threat to the maintenance of
the Honor System,

If you have ventured this far down this editorial column,
you have encountered enroute four motives for resisting co-
education, They are four seemingly logical justifications for
this paper's position on this primarily individual and emo-
tional issue,

ut the crux of this quandary is that coeducational en-
dorsements or rejections by students, student committees, stu-
dent referenda, or student publications are fundamentally
moot. Students will not resolve this controversy. Students
may vote unanimously in favor of eoeducation Monday; so
what? Think back to the most recent referendum on an im-
portant question facing W&L. It might be an ego-crusher
for undergraduates to recall the spring of 1970, when 85 per
cent of the voting students expressed a desire to shut the
school down. We are now on the verge of the spring of 1972
and W&L shows little intention, as of yet, to close its doors,
lhe lesson to be learned here is that students are virtually
powerless concerning coeducation.

If this theory of student subjugation in university deei-
sion-making can be accepted, one thing is clear, You can kiss
coedueation goodbye, until the gentlemen in Washington Hall
wholeheartedly support the idea, That is because they along
with the alumni-dominated trustees, run this place, not the
students, Lately, these people show no signs of embracing
coeducation as the savior of W&L, instead they seem quite
hestitant to even regard coeducation as one of the more
salient problems to be dealt with,

Oh yes, returning to W&L's greatest indoor sport. The
score? It has been updated to all-male chauvinistic pigs 5
coedueationalists 3.

1.W.R,

Elections Set For Monday

President

Bob Brennan

1 feel that the main issue in this
campaign is the Honor System, for
it is the president of the student
body who carries the main respon-
sibility for its continuance,

Having initiated the current study
of our Honor System, | have been
involved. in an examination of its
conceptual basis as well as. its pro-
cedural mechanism. My participa-
tion in this study has exposed me
to one particular area of the Sys-
tem where I believe its strength
and greatness lie: Over the past few
years, it seems that this area has
been de-emphasized—de-emphasized
to the point that the Honor System
is no longer respected and conse-
quently no longer effective.

My experience of the past sev-
eral weeks has reaffirmed nmty belief
that the Honor System under which
we, as members of the University,
live is in essence not intended as a
binding concept but a liberating one;
that is to say, what is important
about the system is that it works, not
because of a fear of what will hap-
pen to us if we cross the boundaries
which it sets, but rather that it fune-
tion as a concept which allows us a
greater sense of freedom in owt ac-
tions. The ultimate goal of the
Honor System is to create within our
community an atmosphere which
permits us to live without the aca-
demic or personal limitations which
exist in some communities in which
lying, cheating and stealing may not
be considered dishonorable. What
all this says is that I believe the
coneept of our Honor System is
valid—now, why isn’t it working?

In my opinion, there are two
basic reasons for the present inef-
feetiveness of the Honor System—a
lack of personal responsibility to the
system by those living under it and
a lack of a sense of community
among the members of the univer-
sity. | believe that both of these
problems can be overcome by a new
approach on the part of the Execu-
tive Committee in their presenta-
tion and handling of the Honor
System and by an attempt by that
body itself to generate the sense of
community needed to allow the sys-
tem to work,

My main coneern if elected presi-
dent of the student body will be to
see that steps are taken to accom-
plish these two goals so that we may
once again live in a community of
mutual trust and respect.

Rick Gray

I'm very fearful that the Honor
System has become the Honor Sys-
tem of the E.C. and not that of the
student body. I visualize an Honor
System with which every student
can identify and know that he can
influence those administering the
system. I would like to suggest:

1. having completely open F.C.

meetings

2. the posting of a summary of
the facts (excluding names) follow-
ing each honor trial (except where
the accused opts for a public trial)
and the verdict. This would inform
the student body of the workings
of the Honor System and it would
force the E.C. to be responsive to
student opinion.

3. completely revamping the pre-
sent public trial procedure in re-
gards to the process of jury selection
and the doing away with the E.C.
and defense councils, | advocate
having the jury consist of the first
12 names the computer picks who
do not know the accused and have
no pre-trial knowledge that would
prevent them from forming an ob-
jective decision, | believe the jury
ought to act as the E.C., question
the accused, and call any witnesses
it deems important and likewise the
accused could say anything he want-

ed and call any witnesses in his be-
half. | believe that this would in-
sure the best. interests of the ac-
cused and the Honor System in that
I feel under our present procedure
the councils divert attention from
the the issues and cloud the facts
with their presentations.

This year the E.C. has made many
mistakes from orientation to actual
honor hearings. These mistakes, in
my opinion, were not caused by a
lack of effort or desire, but by a
lack of experience. Next year is a
crucial year for the Honor System
and we can not afford to let the
same mistakes occur, thus I firmly
believe my experience will be a
great help.

I promise to do the best job |
possibly can and to give that job as
much time as it takes to get it done.

Vice-
President

Archer Frierson

It seems to me, as a candidate for
the office of Vice-President of the
Student Body, that the first and
foremost consideration in casting
one’s ballot for next year’s Execu-
tive Committeemen should be a
concern that twelve dedicated and
interested students be elected to in-
sure the proper implementation and
maintenance of the Honor System.
After serving this past year as a
representative to the E.C. from the
Junior Class, it has become my
staunch conviction that the work-
able preservation of the Honor Sys-
tem, subject only to the prevail-
ing sentiments of the student gen-
eration involved, is clearly the sin-
gle most important task of this body.
Certainly it is important and ex-
pected that these student representa-
tives express their views on current
topics such as coeducation, curri-
culum changes, future physical ex-
pansions of the university, and other
pressing concerns, and that specific-
ally in the case of the Vice-Presi-
dem, he be able to fulfill his two
chief duties: 1) advising a person
accused for an honor violation of
his rights, and, 2) managing accur-
ately the Central Student Body
Fund. But it is imperative, I be-
lieve, that these issues be met and
dealt with when they arise, that they
be basically secondary concerns,
and that the attention, time, and
energy of every E. C. member be
channeled primarily to a fundamen-
tal appreciation of the Honor Sys-
tem, tempered and directed by a
constant process of re-examining and
re-evaluating its application to our
lives here at W&L. So on Monday,
1 hope that you, after considering
these thoughts and weighing the
alternatives, will give me the oppor-
tunity to carry out this vitally im-
portant job.

Bill Merrill

The duties of the Vice-President
are, first, to fulfill the duties of the
President in his absence; second, to
manage disbursements of Student
Body Funds; and finally, to act as
the advisor to the accused in an
honor trial.

Sinee the first of these is basic-
ally that of a stand-in, | would like
to briefly address myself to the
problems attendant to the last two.

Through custom or tradition or a
combination of both, student body
funds have not been managed as
carefully as they should have been.
The rising costs of tuition and the
fact that Student Body Funds come
from an activities fee payable upon
registration make it imperative that
the fands not be wasted, but used to
serve the best interests of the stu-
dent body.

To insure that the maximum pos

sible benefit accrues to the student
body, all E. C. expenditures should
be itemized and tallied. This infor-
mation should be readily available
to all students.

Having served on the E.C. and
having been one of the founding
members of the current study group
on the Honor System, I believe that
| have acquired insights, experience
and an understanding of the Honor
System which will enable me to
better assist the accused in the event
of an honor trial.

The mutual trust and confidence
engendered by the Honor System
should also be applied to the accus-
ed, and the Vice-President should
be responsible for the assurance that
the accused enjoys the benefits of
the Honor System up until the time
that his guilt has been established.

An effective student government
requires the support of the student
body, so no matter whom you vote
for Monday, at least vote.

Secretary
Bill Clark

During my three years of enroll-
ment at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, | have served as an assistant
to our Basketball team, a fraternity
Vice-President, and as a member
on the sophomore council in 1971,
| think it important that a junior
run for the office of Student Body
Secretary, if not for having three
years of experience in the Univer-
sity community, then because some-
one who is holding the office as a
senior has aspirations which are
solely for the betterment of the Uni-
versity and not for any future per-
sonal advancement.

As Student Body Secretary my
main concern aside from perform-
ing the functional duties that my of-
fice calls for, is with the Honor
System and with upholding it as it
now stands, I feel that there should
definitely be an Honor System at
Washington and Lee University but
this is not at all feasible if the sys-
tem is inflexible. Inflexibility has al-
ways crumbled under pressure. Con-
stant scrutiny of past and future
events concerning the Honor Sys-
tem should continually occur and
then, if necessary, relevant changes
should and must be made in order to
maintain the survival of a system
that will be an asset and not a detri-
ment to a working University com-
munity.

Lewis Powell

The primary function of the Exe-
cutive Committee is the mainten-
ance of Washington and Lee’s Hon-
or System. My candidacy for Stu-
dent Body Secretary is a result of
my growing concern for the vitality
of the Honor System. My concern is
twofold.

First, freshman orientation has
been sadly inadequate, Not only is
it important to make information
available to entering students, but

Black Focus

The New W&L

BY JOHNNY E. MORRISON

The turn of the sixties brought
about a change among the previous-
ly all-white institutions of higher
learning. This has caused some white
intellectuals and students to rejoice
because of this “new era” and some
to be the victims of “a back to nor-
maley” desire.

This new era is the presence of
Black students on formerly all-white
colleges and universities, When |
speak of back to normalcy, | am re-
ferring to those students who still
have their mothers’ and fathers’
sickness—the belief that white peo-
ple are superior and Blacks are in-
ferior, The purpose of this concise,
but provocative editorial is to ex-
pose the true experiences of a Black
student on a previously all-white and
now a predominately white campus
such as Washington and Lee Univer.
sity. This vis-a-vis essay will only
touch upon some of the things which
we Blacks encounter at Washington
and Lee.

1 will try to cause the reader to
use the mechanics of his intellect to
ponder upon the matter. My only
hope is that those who have never
gone through this experience do not
say “I know how you feel” because
that will be a lie beyond comprehen
sion. | think ut will be more ap-
propriate for you to say “I am in
sympathy with you.”

When one touches upon the social
aspects of the Black students, he
will find a consensus of “not too
good and sometimes very bother
some.” The following are responses

 

an active effort should be made to
disseminate this information to
freshmen, That the Honor System be
thoroughly understood is a necess-
ity, and a more vigorous orienta-
tion effort by the E.C. is essential to
this understanding.

Secondly I feel that more precau-
tions should be taken to ensure the
secrecy of E.C, investigations into
possible infractions of the Honor
Code. The possibility of an open
hearing makes this especially criti-
cal. For when secrecy is compro-
mised, students often come to the
open hearing already having decided
for themselves. The ill-effects of
such a situation are that open hear-
ings often degenerate into circus-
like trials full of Perry Mason
theatrics. Such trials stand in open
mockery to the letter and spirit of
the Honor System.

Should I be elected [ shall seek
an intensification of the E.C.’s
orientation effort. In addition to this
| would hope that open hearings are
returned to a proper level of honest
and sincere investigation.

| envision the 1973 Fancy Dress
as a Golden Marathon of Joy, un-
precedented in the history of W&L
Big Weekends. After great dedica-
tion and thought | have witnessed
the true vision of an epic festival of
entertainment. To help in the ful-
fillment of this vision, | shall distri-
bute a questionnaire to all the peo-
ple for a preference of entertain-
ment, dates, and locations for the
1973 Dance. | feel that current dis-
satisfaction over this year’s over-
crowded, underentertained Fancy
Dress, spiced with only 3.2 beer
can be greatly improved with the
aid of such a student poll,

I am decidedly in favor of an in-
formal theme party, without the
stilted formalities which have mark-
ed previous Fancy Dresses. If at all
feasible | will try to explore the
possibility of holding Fancy Dress
in the Spring with afternoon con-
certs with varied popular enter-
tainment on Wilson Field. Further,
| promise that the featured “Big
Name” entertainment will perform
for the majority of the Ball, rather
than be used merely as a “come-
on”,
| wish to utilize the spirit and
dress which marked student parti-
cipation in this year’s Fancy Dress
in the 1973 Dance. It is hoped that
the Student Poll proposed above
will help me produce a weekend in
keeping with the sentiments and
preferences of the whole student
body. It is my dsire to combine the
party spirit of previous Fancy
Dresses with the tastes and modes
of today’s students, Finally, I exhort

from some Black students to the
question, “How has social life been
at Washington and Lee University?”

Student I: “As far as getting down
to girls’ schools, it was difficult be-
cause no brother has a car, but you
could sometimes get a ride with a
white guy, On that angle, you never
knew when you had a date. In gen-
eral, social life was a day here be-
cutise this is where we are based at.”

Student Ik: “Miserable, unthink-
able, The most exciting things were
being turned away from a free con-
cert, kicked out of a fraternity's
open party and occasional encount-
ers with red-necks.”

Student Hk: “There is no social
life for a Black student. The geo-
graphical location of Washington
and Lee is geared for the middle and
upper-class white students who can
afford to get a car, | do net con
sider it a social life to sit around
and watch white guys have fun.”

The social life at Washington and
Lee has changed to a large degree
for the best. Now that Black students
see themselves as not only students
of Washington and Lee but also as
an integral part of the Black citi
zens of the communities, there are
more things to get invelved in and
more places to go. All of the Blacks
here agree in general that besides
being bogged down with arduous
study to make decent grades, playing
pool, going to a movie, playing bas-
hetball or sitting together talking
among ourselves. we are finding a
mich better soxial atmosphere he

Rebuttal On “Hazing”

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

In view of Mr. Sherman's re-
marks which appeared in this paper
last week, I feel somewhat. obligated
to offer a reply. Although I person-
ally feel that fraternities have much
to offer, | do not mean to appear
as an offended member of Phi Kap-
pa Sigma speaking out in blanket
praise of everything that fraternities

(Phi Kappa Sigma in particular) do.
Rather | hope that what I have. to
say will point out to Mr, Sherman
that he was wrong in trying to por-
tray some type of cruel and inhuman
treatment given to pledges on cam-
pus.

To begin with, if Mr. Sherman
feels that duck-walking across Jeff-
erson St. is severe punishment, then
he has all my sympathy. Second, to
this date none of the pledges have

contracted pneumonia due to the
dousing they received, and again if
Mr. Sherman feels that this is ex-
tremely degrading then he is the
object of only pity from me,

To suggest that one could only
surmisey what took place after the
pledges entered the house is entire-
ly true. The point is that Mr, Sher-
man. did. not. have any idea of what
took. place and therefore had no
justification for trying to give the
impression that some type of harm-
ful treatment was administered to
the pledges once they entered. I
can assure him and everyone else
that nothing of the sort took place.

In. checking the records I have
found. that Mr. Sherman didn’t even
go through fraternity rush this year
and so has virtually no knowledge
of how the system works, I find it
inconceivable that he can offer
criticism to something that he has
never been associated with.

As far as Phi Kappa Sigma is
concerned, not once in recent me-
mory have we lost a pledge due to
the supposedly “degrading” nature
of our pledging activities. On the
contrary, hazing (or whatever you
wish to call it) is looked back on
by pledges and actives (of all fra-
ternities here I believe) as a worth-
while, unifying, and even enjoyable
experience. But it is perfectly natu-
ral for Mr. Shrman to be unable to
appreciate. these feelings—he has
never been involved in the system
which promote them,

| hope that in the future Mr,
Sherman will confine his advice and
letters to the Editor to subjects
about which he has some well-
founded criticism rather than tearing
down something which he knows
nothing about,

Is This A Free Spirit?

Last night I was in the periodi-
cal room of the library and was
witness to the usual lizzard sprawl
of students. This I take in stride
(well, almost), But one student was
barefooted and casually picking his
toes. Now the question arises: is
this a free spirit or a barbarian?
Is this a liberated man or a spoiled
brat? And, finally, what in the hell
goes on over there in terms of dis-
cipline and self discipline?

Dr. Milton Colvin

Disappointment Shown
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

This week the Student Associa-
tion for Black Unity of W&L is pre-
senting its first annual Black Cul-
ture Week. This series of events has
been advertised through the Ring-
tum Phi, WLUR, the school calen-
dar, posters, flyers, and many, many
other sources,

The point of this letter is this: the
white students of W&L are, in my
opinion, taking a negative attitude
to Black Culture Week. For the last
few days | have heard or heard of
student statements such as “what
are these savages doing putting up
this Black s. .t” or “why are these
Blacks having a Black Culture Week
that doesn't relate to me.” It has
been stated over and over again that
the ‘week’ serves to help the Black
students to maintain their racial
identity (which WA&L doesn't do
much for) and to serve as a means
of educating the white students and
community of W&L as to what
Blacks and Black culture is all
about. |i is one way of answering
the proverbial white statement ‘I
can't understand Blacks, What do
they want?’

O.K. We have the week. Do the
students respond? No! Monday
night. Prof. Colon spoke at Lee
Chapel to an audience made up of
WAL faculty and administrators.
people from Lexington, some girls
from some school, and VERY FEW
WAL STUDENTS, For a student
body that can pack Lee Chapel to
hear some poems, listen to political
talk, and hear a good amateur play
piano—even when they are broad-
casted on WLUR—this is stupid.
lt is ridiculous, Contact was during

 

mid-terms but the talks were pack-
ed,

Saturday, S.A.B.U. is having a
‘Black Ball.’ This is the only social
affair put on in the ‘W&L tradition’
since I've been to this school. Are
students attending in groves? No.
Every member of SABU was to sell
ten reservations, I've sold 24. Only
one has been purchased by. a stu-
dent, I've even gone to students
rooms to announce the week, Some
students have shown interest and
said “I don’t have the five bucks on
me now but | am going.” However,
most have said “if I buy a ticket,
I'll get it from you” or “I've got bet-
ter things to do like studying.” Stu-
dents have time during exams to
see the stag flicks at the Lyric. They
always complain about nothing to
do, Give them something interest-
ing, relevant and financially cheap
and they don’t come.

I am pissed off to say the least. It
seems to me that the white students
are trying to ignore Black people.
For students like that I feel sorry
for you. You are acting like that
great president Calvin ‘if you ignore
it it'll go away’ Coolidge. Black peo-
ple must not and will not be ig-
nored! Ignore us and you will truly
suffer in the long run, (For years

Survey Results Announced

Almost half of the 352 men who
entered Washington and Lee Uni-
versity as freshmen last autumn
plan to become physicians or law-
yers—more than triple the propor-
tion among their counterparts across
the nation, according to results of
surveys made by the American
Council on Education at 326 col-
leges throughout the country in Sep-
tember,

The A.C.E. survey showed that
34.5 per cent of our freshmen are
planning careers as lawyers and 14.1
per cent as medical doctors or den-
tists, Nationally, the respective aver-
ages for men in four-year colleges
were 8.5 per cent and 7.0 per cent.

More than two-thirds here—69
per cent—said they keep abreast of
political affairs, 21 per cent more
than the men’s average nationally.

Our freshmen also described them-
selves as slightly more liberal than
their predecessors had one year
earlier. Politically, they were more
“far left’ or “liberal”—42.1 per
cent—and slightly less “conserva-
tive” or “far right"—26.7 per cent
~-in 1971 than the freshmen class
of a year earlier, when the figures
had been 36.2 per cent and 27.9
per cent. Middle-of-the-roaders ac-
counted for 36.2 per cent of the
freshmen in 1970 and just 31.2 per
cent this fall. Nationally, the score
was; “far left”—3.6 per cent to our

  

Students As Gentlemen

BY MARC SMALL

The Honor System is dead. It died
a lamentable death sometime dur-
ing my freshman or sophomore
year, along with the conventional
dress and the homogeneous student
body. It lives on in memory—a con-
venient way to raise money from
alumni and a saccharine sop to en-
tice potential freshmen—but in me-
mory alone, for the student body
supports the concept but not the
workings of an effective honor sys-
tem.

It requires moral courage to main-
tain such a moral code, It requires
substantial courage not merely to
live by an honor system—for that
is a measure of integrity the great
majority of us willingly agree to live
by—but rather to enforce it upon
others: it is not a pleasant thing: to
turn in a compadre or to warn a
friend that you may have to explain
some case involving him to the Exe-
cutive Committee. It is the courage
involved in turning in others that
has failed, and it is in this failure
that the Honor System has passed
away.

Yet, herein lies the crux of the
matter, since any moral code, like
any law, is only effective if en-
forced, We ourselves may live by
the code, but that code will be a
mockery and thoroughly unreliable
unless we are sure that all others
within the student body are com-
pelled also to abide by it. The im-
perfectibility of the human animal
requires that we, it we hope to be
judged by certain standards our-
selves, be willing to police the Honor
System to insure its proper function-
ing.

We are a select gathering of men,
well above the average in intellect
It should not be, and until recently
was not, impossible to function un-
derneath the firm standard of the
Honor System. Yet if we are to be
regarded as gentlemen, then it is
imperative that we behave as such,
no matter where we are or during
what part of the school year it may
happen to be. The concepts of integ-
rity and dignity know neither the
bounds of time or space: it is our
duty, both as individuals and as a
body, to insure that the respect for
our honesty gained over the past two
centuries shall not be sacrificed
thoughtlessly and needlessly,

The Honor System is dead, and
almost certainly beyond resurrec-
tion, lt would be far better for us

to vote it a quick and a clean deat
than to continue to mock its ghost
with every passing theft, falsehood,
and civil violation that a Washing-
ton and Lee student commits, The
students have shown with near un-
animity during the past two years
that they have no faith in the sys-
tem. The faculty have voiced their
concern by their disgust for inde-
pendent exams. Those groups work-
ing most closely with the Honor
System have found it wanting.

It is time for both the students
and the faculty to re-assess_ their
regard for the Honor System and to
examine its value. If the students de-
sire to realize that privilege implies
responsibility, then let us by all
means revive the Honor System. If
the students feel they are not will-
ing to police this student-run sys-
tem, then indeed it is time for us to
abolish the Honor System and, at
least, show to ourselves an honesty
we refuse to show to our fellows.

 

1.5, “liberal” — 38.0 per cent to
W&L’s 40.6 per cent, “middle of the
road”—41.4 as compared to our
31.2 per cent, “conservative’— 16.1
per cent to 25.8 per cent here, and
finally “far right” at 0.9 per cent all.

In their self-descriptions, Wash-
ington and Lee men see their acade-
mic talents as more abundant and
their families more affluent than the
national averages, They are some-
what less pessimistic than their peers
about the ability to change society;
36 per cent here against 47 per cent
nationally said they believe the in-
dividual has little influence. As may
be expected, then, they also intend
to vote this fall in heavier propor-
tions than the national average; 89
per cent as against 77 per cent
among male freshmen nationally.

The “average” W&L freshman
differed significantly in his attitudes
from his fellow freshmen nation-
ally in a number of fields, including
responses to the notion of abolish-
ing college grades (favored by only
27 per cent here, and 42 per cent
nationally), and to the idea of giving
preferential treatment to students
from so-called “disadvantaged” back-
grounds (favored by 40 per cent on
a national basis, 29 per cent at our
school).

A majority of freshmen both at
Washington and Lee and nationally
thought criminals had been given
“too many rights’—S7 per cent
here, 53 per cent in all four-year
colleges. And while 61 per cent of
their counterparts said they think
everybody should have the oppor-
tunity to go to college, only 43 per
cent of our freshmen said they
thought so.

Exactly half the male freshmen
nationally said they believe the fed-
eral government is not implement-
ing desegregation quickly enough,
but just 37.1 per cent at W&L said
they agree. More than 90 per cent,
however, both locally and na-
tionally, said they thought the fed-

Generals Barely Win
CAC Championship

The Basketball Generals stayed
home with a College Athletic Con-
ference Tournament Trophy and 17-
9 record in spite of dropping the
season's finale to Southwestern-at-
Memphis 79-78. The loss was a dis-
appointing one but was not a total
surprise. The Generals had won the
last two games by a total of three
points, 78-76 against Sewanee, and
76-75 against Centre.

All three teams were out to pick
off the defending champions. The
result was a three way tie for first
place. W&L ,Centre and Southwes-
tern all had 2-1 tournament records.

lwo generals were selected for
the CAC All-Tournament Team.
Mike Daniel was a repeater and
Skip Lichtfuss made the elite outfit
as a sophomore. Centre's James
Mason was chosen as the Outs and-
ing Player.

Thursday night the Generals
downed Sewanee. The opposition
was led by 7-0 center Bill Kosick

who grabbed 15 rebounds and
pumped in 33 points. Mike Daniel
led the W&L scorers with 25, Licht-
fuss hit for 18. Charlie Strain got
13, John Glace did a good defen-
sive job against Kosick.

The next evening W&L collided
with Centre, James Mason earned
his berth on the All-Tournament
team against the Blue. He clobbered
the Generals with 24 points, 19 re-
bounds and a blocked shot, It was
no surprise to see captain Daniel
sparkplug the Generals from 15
points behind, Mike connected for
22 points, nine rebounds and three
assists, It was Skip Lichtfuss who
cooly put the game away with his
7 for 8 marksmanship at the foul
line. Skip completed the game with
11 points. Doug Clelan had 11 also,
Paul McClure contributed 10 points,

rhe final game W&L ran out of
come-from-behind victories. Doug
Clelan established a new school rec-
ord for assists during the game. His
season total was 122, the old record
belonged to “Magic” Mel Cart-
wright. Washington and Lee fell be-
hind but as Coach Verne Canfield
said, “They never quit.” Lichtfuss
and Daniel were top Blue scorers
with 22 and 23 respectively. South-
western’s Cardwell, who tied a CAC
record with 34 points against Se-
wanee in the preliminaries, threw
in 27 against the Generals. But it

was foul shooting that won the game
for the visitors, The Lynx missed
only six shots in 37 tries—83 per
cent,

The calibre of the CAC tourna-
ment was relatively high. The four
entrants were evenly matched, The
six games were determined by a
total spread of 22 points,

Looking back on the 1971-72
season, the games were predom-
inantly tight up until the buzzer.
Canfield admitted, “We had too
many, too close.” During the season
eleven games were decided in the
final minute including all the CAC
Tournament games. Despite scoring
over 80 points per game, the Gen-
erals were a defense oriented team.
The high scoring average was due to
a potent fast break. The break was
especially devastating off a missed
foul shot. The Generals acquired a
low degree of balanced scoring. In
spite of the surge of sophomore
Skip Lichtfuss, the opposition knew
for the big play, the Blue would de-
pend on Mike Daniel.

Without a doubt, the star of the
17-9 season was senior Mike Daniel.
Daniel edged up to fourth on the
all-time W&L scoring list. This win-
ter, he averaged over 24 points a
game, and shot over 58 per cent
from the floor, On four different
occasions, the Academic All-Ameri-
can scored in excess of 30 points.
Emory and Henry Coach Arnold
Mellings said of the All-American
candidate, “He could play for any-
body in the country.”

The year had many high points
and many low ones for the b-ballers.
The victories over Centre and Rhode
Island (88-86) were outstanding.
The Blue was at its best. In both
games, the Generals played excel-
lent team basketball. The Blue re-
fused to quit, and kept its cool
under pressure. Perhaps the most
disappointing aspect of the cam-
paign was the lack of consistency.
The Generals were hot only in
spurts, failing to put together long
winning streaks.

The back line improved as the
season continued, Daniel of course
was outstanding. Skip Lichtfuss
came on strong about mid-season.
Paul McClure gained some endur-
ance, aggressiveness and offensive
punch. The backcourt combination

By now, almost everyone knows
that Washington and Lee hosted the
College Athletic Conference basket-
ball tournament this past weekend,
and most know that the Generals
finished in a three-way tie for the
championship, losing the final game
by a mere point to Southwestern at
Memphis. So now its time for all
the armchair quarterbacks, or play-
makers, as the case may be, to em-
ploy their twenty-twenty hindsight to
analyze the tourney. And that in-
cludes yellow journalists like me,
Forthwith my comments on the
weekend:

The Generals could not buy a re-
bound. The only thing that kept
WAL in the games at all was some
hot outside shooting. If the Generals
had not come charging back in the
second half of each game, using an
aggressive defense and an outside
game, they might have been blown
off the court. Had the club been
able to command the boards, the
Generals would have been easy vic-
tors. It was just a bit too much to
expect a team to pull three games
three nights in a row out of the fire,
as W&L did the first two games.

One of the best shows of the year
came to Lexington and played to a
big crowd Thursday night, specific-

los tried hard to rate his own Sports
IMustrated article a la Bill Mussel-
man of Minnesota, succeeding only
in costing his team a victory and in
making a spectacle of himself, In-
deed, the Generals hit all three foul
shots awarded them due to Davalos’
technical fouls, beating the Purple
Tigers by two points. The Sewanee
mentor seemed itching for a fight,
and later that night he almost got
one with W&L’s Boyd Williams.
Anyhow, Davalos seemed to add his
name to the growing list of basket-
ball coaches who ought to be in
football somewhere.

And just out of curiosity, what
was the reason given for the loss of
lighting Saturday night? Rumor has
it that somebody hit the light switch,
If that’s the explanation, well, never
mind, but it seems silly that such a
possibility could occur,

And finally, congratulations to
Mike Daniel and Skip Lichtfuss for
their All-CAC performances and to
Coach Verne Canfield for his res-
traint in the Davalos matter in
which the latter cast aspersions up-
on Canfield’s ancestry. Oh yes, con-
grats to the swimming team for its
CAC championship and to the
wrestling team for its third place

Swimmers Win CAC Crown;
W&L Wrestlers Place Third

Washington and Lee successfully
defended its College Athletic Con-

ference swimming championship
during the conference meet last
weekend at Centre College, Ky.,

setting several new records in the
process. Meanwhile, the wrestling
team finished a close third in their
CAC competition.

The Generals’ Beach (Bim) Clark
of Atlanta was named the “Out-
standing Swimmer” after winning
two individual events, placing sec-
ond in another, and swimming on
two winning relay teams. He set
new meet, pool, school and confer-
ence records in winning the 200-yard
butterfly, and tied the meet and
pool records in winning the 100-yard
butterfly. He also finished second in
the 50-yard freestyle and swam on
the winning W&L medley relay and
freestyle relay teams,

WA&L’s John Lawlor set new meet,

pool, school and conference records
in winning the 1650-yard freestyle,
and also won the 200-yard breast-
stroke, was second in the 400-yard
individual medley, and was on the
winning medley relay team,

Other winners for W&L were
freshman Steve Johnston in the
500-yard freestyle; sophomore Rick
McCain in the 100-yard  breast-
stroke; the 400-yard medley relay
team of Hal Catlin, Lawlor, Clark
and freshman Bill Brotherton; the
400-yard freestyle relay team of
freshmen Dick Barber and Jim Ho-
ward, Aven Sharp and Clark; and
the 800-yard freestyle relay team
of Catlin, Johnston, Alan Corwith

and Brotherton .

Sewanee finished second to W&L
in the conference meet, followed by
host Centre and Washington Uni-
versity of St. Louis,

Meanwhile, the Generals wrest-

ling team finished a close third in
the season-ending College Athletic
Conference meet last weekend, but
new W&L Coach John Piper sees a
bright outlook for his young charges.

Wa&L tallied 6914 points to run-
ner-up Centre’s 7214 and winning
Sewanee’s 10214. Washington Uni-
versity of St. Louis was fourth with
3614, and host Southwestern (Tenn.)
was fifth with 7.

All of W&L’s wrestlers placed in
the tournament, and the Generals
had two champions in 126-pound
Rolf Piranian and 177-pound Doug
Ford, Runners-up for the Generals
were 142-pound captain Bill West,
167-pound Sam Lewis and 190-
pound Lanny Rainey.

Finishing third were 118-pound
Dunean DeGraff, 134-pound Rick
Marsh and 150-pound Jim Stieff.
Fourth-place finishers for the Gen-
erals were 158-pound Perry Sowell

 

Wrestling team captain Bill West goes to work on his man in the Hampden-Sydney match. West was a run-
ner-up in the 142-pound class at the CAC Tournament.

cause we know most of the Blacks
in the community.

The educational aspects relating
to Black students can be shown
by simply saying that the Black,
upon entering a school with Wash-
ington and Lee's caliber realize that
he is behind. He is behind in his edu-
cation because his secondary edu-
cation gave him limited access to
quality educational material and
facilities simply because the school
was predominantly Black. Since cal-
culus is the lowest math course here
and no remedial course is offered in
English, the Black student has to
spend some of his time trying to
learn what was not offered in his
high school.

We now generally agree that the
administration and the faculty is
seeing that this is no longer a homo-
geneous student body but is now a
heterogeneous student body. When
we Blacks first entered Washington
and Lee University and discovered
the problems which existed, we gave
the administration and the faculty
a chance to alleviate them. Al-
though the administration and facul-
ty are not faultless and flawless, all
of us — Black students — recognize
their help and determination to get
rid of the problems. Unlike most
administrations and faculties at pre-
dominately white institutions, Wash-
ington and Lee recognizes that she is
dealing with something unique and
is trying to work out things in re-

absolute penalty. He said that it
would be a rare instance in which
he would agree with permanent dis-
missal as an appropriate penalty,
and expressed the opinion that the
ostracism resulting from widespread
scrutiny of a public notice of an
honor violation would be a suffici-
ent penalty in nearly all cases.

“B” also suggested several pro-
cedural changes in the EC's job of
administering the Honor System.
He advised that a much more in-
tensive and lengthy orientation pro-
gram be implemented and re-em-
phasized throughout the year, It
was also his idea that a “pre-trial
hearing” would be valuable in con-
sidering a possible violation, and
that, in the event it was determined
by the EC to proceed to a private
hearing, the accused be permitted
to have advisors, probably law stu-
dents, sitting as advisors, He also
felt that, in the event of a public
hearing. the first twelve students
chosen at random by the computer
with no prior knowledge of the case
be taken as jurors, and that the
hearing should remain public, with
the accused having the option of
determining its location.

sponse to this uniqueness. Many
problems still remain and many ob-
stacles still block the road to suc-
cess but we as Black students hope
that the administration will continue
to communicate and work along
with us so we can have an amelio-
ration of these problems and ob-
stacles.

Black students have come a long
way since last year. Other than the
two Black students in law and the
two Black seniors, all the other
Blacks are freshmen and sopho-
mores. Organizing ourselves into a
group whose goal is to facilitate
the eradication of the problems
came quite easy. We, the Student
Association for Black Unity, con-
ceive of ourselves as an_ essential
organization for both the Univer-
sity and the Black community, Our
intention is to show the things need-
ed at the University—from  curri-
culum revision to recruitment-and
to propagate throughout the whole
and the community what Blackness
really is. This is one of the main
reasons for Black Culture Week.

This week began on Monday,
February 28 and will end March 4.
Professor Herbert Marshall of Nor-
folk State College will be the guest
speaker tonight. This speech is in the
memory of Leslie Smith, the first
Black Law student to graduate from
Washington and Lee University.
Smith was slain while working for
the Justice Department in Washing-
ton, D.C, this year. The Black stu-
dents from the Roanoke Public
school will give their Black History
Presentation titled “Legacy of Free-
dom” on Thursday.

We previously tried to get LC.
Norcom High School from Ports-
mouth, Virginia. This fell through
because of our—Student Association
for Black Unity—tlack of funds to
meet the cost. We hope and are
diligently working toawrds having
them during the latter part of
March. There will be a symposium
Friday and its theme will be “On
Being Black—In a White Society”
The Black students of Washington
and Lee and surrounding colleges
will make up the panel. The last
event of Black Culture Week will
be held on Saturday night. This will
be a formal or semi-formal Ball and
the music will be given by The Dy-
namics of Lynchburg.

Yes, this is the first time that
something of this nature has ever
been given at Washington and Lee
University. | did not elaborate on
the white students’ concern and at-
titude toawrds Blacks and Black-
ness but their concern or indiffer-
ence will be shown by their pre-
sence and support during the first
Black Culture Week at Washing-
ton and Lee University. This school
is no longer the same as it was five
years ago. This is now the new
Washington and Lee University.

University Council Says
Housemothers Optional

The Interfraternity Council's pro-
posal to render the employment of
housemothers optional for W&L
fraternity houses, effective Septem-
ber 1972, finally passed last Thurs-
day when the University Council
held their regular monthly session.
In addition there was considerable
discussion about student parking
problems.

The University Council's decision
on the housemother proposal is
contingent on the IFC's presenting
next month a satisfactory plan for
phasing out housemothers and giv-
ing proper notice to those who
might be affeoted.

“We are very pleased with the
vote,” said IFC President Bob La-
Rue, “However, there won't be any
rush to dump housemothers. Many
houses have already expressed the

Souvenirs Taken From
Lee Chapel Museum
After SABU Concert

BY PAUL LANCASTER
Over $182 worth of souvenirs
were taken from the Lee Chapel
museum fast Thursday night
Most of the items were of little
worth individually, but their quant-
ity——101 assorted charms, pendants,
spoons, and other souvenirs—made
the theft a large one
The theft apparently occurred
Thursday night during or after a
concert put on by a group of Roa
noke school children as part of
SABU's Black Culture week activi
ties, “The kids had supervi

the chapel. “and they changed thei

sentiment that they would be better
off with housemothers than without
them.”

With University President R. E. R.
Huntley and Student Body President
Steve Robinson presiding, the Coun-
cil debated the IFC Housemother
proposal for nearly one and a half
hours. The proposal, which had
been defeated by the Student Affairs
Committee several weeks ago, was
re-introduced before the UC by
IFC President Robert LaRue and
IFC Senior Justice Joe Garten.

LaRue and Garten argued that
many fraternity housemothers really
have no real duties, and therefore
present an unnecessary burden on
many houses. It was emphasized

W@&L: Where It Has Been, Where It Is Going ==

Administration Viewed As A Personalized Force

BY ANDREW G. SIMPSON, JR.

The following article is meant to
provide a study of the “they” of
Washington and Lee, “They” con-
sists of the people and organization
responsible for University policy.
“They” guides and directs the uni-
versity. “They” gets credit when
things go right on a University-wide
scale. “They” also gets blamed when
things go wrong. “They” is the Ad-
ministration,

Organization is a vital element in
determining the effectiveness of any
governing body. Yet, “they,” better
refers to the Washington and Lee
establishment than does the term
“administration” because it implies
personalization, This study — will
hopefully go beyond what a mere
organizational diagram would pro-
vide because the Washington and
Lee administration is not so much a
structure or organization as it is a
personal, human force.

There are three academic deans
within the administration: the dean
of the College; the dean of the
School of Commerce, Economics,
and Politics; and the dean of the
Law School: The latter is concerned
with graduate study; the two former,
undergraduate,

emphasize in discussing his role as
an administrator that, “Although I
am Dean of a particular School, |
am more a part of Washington and
Lee University than of the indivi-
dual School.” This outlook is a
shared one among administrators.
Decisions are made with the good
of the University as a whole in
mind. Within his own School, Dean
Atwood notes, “Everything is aimed
at the best possible undergraduate
edueation—all programs and peo-
ple—and anything that does not aim
in that direction just doesn’t fit
here.”

Dean Atwood is alone “at the
top” in the School of Commerce,
Economies, and Politics. There is
no Assistant Dean, as such, But the
School is not run by Dean Atwood
alone. Four departments of Ac-
counting, Economics, Politics, and
Administration with appropriate
faculty and department heads con-
stitute the School along with Dean
Atwood. The set-up works well for
the Dean. Much of his time is spent
at innumerable, but necessary com-
mittee meetings with his own de-
partment heads and other admini-
strators. Such communication ses-
sions bring problems and solutions
to the surface. Curriculum changes,
degree requirement modifications,
and a new emphasis on computer

Mareh 8, 1972

Have you ever attempted to cash a check or even pay a bill
with a check in Charlottesville, or any other large university
town? The result is appalling. You are treated somewhat like
a criminal. Identification, addresses and telephone numbers

must be presented.

A\ similar rigmarole may not be far off in the future for
WA&L men in Lexington. Current student checks are bouncing
at an alarming pace, and as a result instilling well-founded
concern in the minds of community entrepreneurs.

The existing situation is markedly gloomy. So far this aca-
demic vear between $800 and $900 worth of bad checks have
heen written, Over 400 students, one quarter of the student
hody, have erred in figuring out bank balances, either inten-

tionally or otherwise.

Albeit these difficulties exist, Washington and Lee is for-
tunate to have a group—the Student Financial Relations Com-
mittee, perhaps bettet known and better described as the
Cold Check Committee—-with the goal of easing this predica-
ment. Actually the committee has a threefold purpose:

1. to handle unpaid accounts accrued by students with

local merchants,
}

ington businessmen,

2. to collect bad checks on a regular basis from Lex-

3. to discipline students with fining power for delin-
queney in financial matters,

Khett Tucker, a committee member summarized, “We must

show the freshman class and all students that we are here

to help them, not simply to punish them. | can say that if our

committee did not exist, a lot more merchants would not ac-

cept checks.

Chuck Lee, chairman of the Student Financial Relations
Committee commented that the “local merchants work on a
low cash basis: they simply cannot afford to take a loss on a

bad check.”

That is the problem; what is the solution? In rudimentary,
candy-covered terms W&L students must protect this check-
cashing privilege by covering their checks, Merchants cannot
accept the loss, but more importantly neither can the stu-
dent body. Remember that “gentlemen” who whip out their
checkhooks and scribble bogus checks are overlooking their
deep responsibility to fellow students,

Concerning the Student Body Elections, the Ring-tum
Phi wishes to extend credit where credit is due. Congratula-
tions to Bob Brennan, President-elect of the Student Body ;
Lewis Powell, Seeretary-elect of the Student Body; “Door-
stop” Jones, President of Faney Dress 1973; John Conrad,
new President of the Interfraternity Council; and John Fol-
sum, the new Vice President of the same body, Each gentle-
man has the potential to transfuse new ideas into student
yvovernment and student activities.

Yet, the question which caused the maximum student

response was, “Do vou believe that coeducation is desirable

for Washington and Lee?”
38 voted ves

\ total of 535 students voted no,
More students voted on this issue than voted
for candidates for any political office,

\pparently, students

feel pretty deeply about coeducation, And equally apparent is
that recent agitation for coeducation at Washington and Lee
has been largely dispelled by so-called conservative, apathetic,
old-fashioned reactionaries. Thank heavens for the conserva

tive, apathetic, old-fashioned reactionaries! It is encouraging
tw survey the students and conelucde that the Ring-tum Phi
does not solitarily oppose regularly enrolled women in the
undergraduate school, As was printed before, credit is ex-

iended where credit is due

J.W.R

application in courses are examples
of the types of academic matter con-
sidered at such meetings:

Even the most recent and big-
gest problem for the School, that
being lack of adequate space, has
found a solution in the young $56-
million building program announc-
ed by the University recently. Pres-
ently the School is “jammed in its
facilities’ in Newcomb Hall. With
the new building plans, the Scheol
will be moved into a renovated Mc-
Cormick building, a move which
Dean Atwood enthusiastically sup-
ports not only because it means ade-
quate space, but because “it will
keep us on the main campus, which
is very important becatise we are
an integral part of the undergradu-
ate program.” This building prob-
lem can be taken as one example of
the types of problems handled by
the administration, and Dean At-
wood’s office in particular.

Department heads are generally
referred to as faculty members and
not as administrators despite the
fact that their duties do involve
some administrative work. They
and the Dean share responsibilities
for academic counselling of  stu-
dents (as do individual faculty mem-
bers, as well) and work closely with
the Dean in making improvements
in the academic program of the
School. Dean Atwood sees no need
now for any enlargement of his
staff. Of his own particular job as
Dean, he says, “I feel | can perform
without assistance at this time.” The
smallness of the University as a
whole and of his School specifically
(it is the smallest school in the
American Association of Collegiate
Schools of Business) aceount for the
adequacy of the present administra-
tive organization within the School,
along with the acknowledged com-
petence of the staff.

The basic functions of the Dean
of the College, William J. Watt,
Ph.D., correspond to those of the
Dean of the School of Commerce,
Economies, and Politics. Similarly,
his unit of responsibility is within
academic aspects of the University
and not in non-academic affairs.
However, his area of responsibility
is much larger in terms of number
of students, faculty members, de-
partments, and department heads
than is that of Dean Atwood. In
addition, the Office of the Registrar
falls under Dean Watt's office. Of-
ficially, the Dean of the College is
the second ranking officer in the ad-
ministration and acts in the presi-
dent's place in the event of the lat-
ters absence.

It is to be expected then that the
Dean of the College have some as-
sistance, and he does in the position
of Assistant Dear of the College,
which is filled by Robert W. Me-
Ahbren, Ph.D. “Assistant Dean Me-
Ahren and | switch around on some
occasions, but the general roles stay
the same,” explains Dean Watt.
Certain aspects of this office's sche-
dule allow for modification so that
at least one of the Deans should be
on hand at all times. The Dean has
the responsibility of proposing, ex-
plaining. implementing, and direct-
ing the policy of the College. He
works closely with the heads ef each
department and with the other ad-
ministrators as must all the Deans
of the University,

His work involves interviewing
and evaluating prospective em-
ployees of the College; evaluating
the present curriculum, exchange
program, and degree requirements;
writing various recommendations;
and providing academic counselling
for students. Much time is spent on
formal committee work, but also
there is an emphasis on informal
contacts with faculty, students, and
other Deans. A characteristic of
this office is the constant procession
of students and faculty members
who enter seeking advice and in-
formation,

While Dean Atwood, Dean Me-
Ahren, Dean Watt (and Dean Stein-
heimer at the graduate school) are
concerned with academic matters,
the Dean of Students is left to han-
die non-academic affairs. As Lewis
G. John, Dean of Students, him-
self describes it: “My responsibili-
ties run the gamut from student or-
ganizations to individual counselling
and, too, to student discipline
through the Student Affairs Com-
mittee.” Reporting directly to Dean
John’s office are the Office of Ad-
missions, Office of Financial Aid,
the Chaplain's Office, the Infirmary,
and the new Office of Coordinator
of the Freshman Year

The Dean of Students has per-
haps the wildest area of concentra.
tion because of its non-academic na-
ture. He has to be thinking in a
number of directions simultaneous-
ly. Whereas, a phone call to an of.
fice of one of the academic deans
would concern more definite mat

ters; a ring on Dean John’s line
could concern an Honor Code vio-
lation, a student misconduct case at
a local girls’ school, a complaint
against a fraternity, a dormitory
counsellor’s problem, a question on
admissions procedure, news on
school loans or scholarships—or
just about anything else a student
could conceivably be involved with
outside of actual classroom work,

Keeping up with such matters
would seem an impossible — task.
However, the administrative officers
of the offices named above bring
order to the confusion of affairs,
Additional administrative officers do
not seem necessary here. Although
the Coordinator of the Freshman
Year has-been. “very helpful” ac-
cording to Dean John, it is believed
that too many more officers would
only add confusion. The present
structure “maintains the necessary
degree of structural flexibility” he
believes, and also maintains a high
degree of personalization, or direct
involvement by those in charge,

The entire administration of
Washington and Lee ean be char-
acterized as young in age. Perhaps
more than any other unit in the
administration, the Office of the
Dean of Students and the related
offices. display this characteristic.
This youthful atmosphere is con-
sidered especially important in deal-
ing direetly with student personnel,
with social behavior questions, and
with other young personalities as
the Dean of Students does.

The Student Affairs Committee,
the Executive Committee, the Stu-
dent Control Committee, the Uni-
versity Council and the Interfrater-
nity Council are the organizations
through which student opinion on
non-acadentic matters is formally
voiced. These organizations fall un-
der Dean John’s office. He considers
student opinion “necessary and very
valuable” for effective functioning
in the University. In fact more
involvement by students is sought
“to help beef up the admissions pro-
gram” and to help increase student
financial aid funds. The Student Re-
cruitment Committee works with the
Admissions Office in the Univer-
sity’s attempt to realize those goals,

It is in the area of academic affairs
where student control seems less
effective than in non-academic af-
fairs. The University Council is de-
signed to give students increased in-
volvement on all matters concerning
students. More directly, the Curri-
culum Committee exists to offer
constructive criticism and sugges-
tions. Student opinion is not without
representation at Board of Trustee
meetings either. The president of
the student body is invited to the
Fall. and. Spring meetings of the
Board, and the president-elect ac-
companies him at the latter.

However, actual student voting
power is neither desirable nor neces-
sary in the opinion of administra-
tors, As Dean Watt sees it, “Stu-
dents are people, like the trustees
and have the same feelings.” It is
believed that things really would
not change that much if students
were given voting power anyway.
Most important in this issue is the
fact that powers of ultimate auth-
ority and responsibility are invested
in the Board of Trustees. The Board
has to be careful as to the extent to
which it delegates authority like
student self-government because, in
the end, it is the Board and not the
students who are held responsibile
for University actions.

As the students’ authority and
respousibility is limited in many as-
pecis, so, too, is the University’s,
Just where the University acts in
a loco parentis capacity is a difficult
question to answer, Just where does
Washington and Lee draw the lines?
According to President Huniley,
the University tries not to act in a
loco parentis capacity to any greai
extent. First of all, the Latin, legal
term bothers President Huntley as,
in his words, “it implies that the
choice is between nothing and par-
ental influence. We cannot be tot-
ally unconcerned about the non-
classroom activities, but we do not
ry to get students to conform to a
predetermined patiern of ours, There
are some who make life chaotic for
the rest and we can't ignore them,
but anything the University does
needs to be tied to its basic function.
Our impact should be through ex.
ample and precept. The values of
Washingion and Lee are shared
values. values of self-respect and
respect for others, You cannot en-
force Vague concepts.”

It appears that the methods of
example and a continuing effort to
foster respect for the Honor System
prove most effective. There is a pre-
ventative rather than punitive em-
phasis. The result has been mini
mal action in a loco parentis capa
ely on the part of the University.

Yet.to be considered is the highly
visible office of the chief executive
of the University, The President of
the University is flanked by a Treas-
urer who is responsible for budget
formulation and control and direc-
tion of all business and develop-
ment services (e.g. University Serv-
ices, Building and Grounds, Data
Processing, University Development,
and Financial Services) and also a
Legal Advisor, Such advisors help,
but cannot greatly reduce the vast
number of responsibilities and duties
of the president,

To say that the president is elect-
ed by the Board of Trustees (of
which he is an ex officio member)
and acts to communicate between
the trustees and the campus leaves
a lot unsaid as to the nature of his
job. President Huntley recognizes
the fact that actually one “could
make a full-time job of any aspect
of his job—but that is not neces-
sary.” The President, above all else,
cannot escape being the principal
spokesman for the University on or
off campus. The President gets the
problems that do not find solutions
any place else.

In his capacity as spokesman off-
campus, the president is expected to,
and does, make numerous trips to
associations and other schools, meets
with executives of other institutions,
makes speeches to various acade-
mic groups, gathers with alumni—
and performs these and other func-
tions with appropriate business, aca-
demic, and social attitudes depend-
ing upon the situation, At all times,
he is conscious of the fact that what
he says and does will reflect upon
the University.

On campus, his activities are like-
wise varied and numerous. There
was a time when President Huntley
made the effort to attend every
social function on campus, but now
that is deemed unnecessary. He at-
tends such functions when he desires
and is able. A typical day on cam-
pus means a full schedule for the
president. He admits, “Everything
has to be compromised. I cannot
operate a completely open-door
policy. I try to get to see people by
appointment.” Appointments are
had with alumni, students, faculty
members, and campus visitors, He
has an average of two to three ap-
pointments with students every day
on campus. His lunch time is often
a working affair where he meets and
discusses matters with Deans, the
Treasurer, the Librarian and others.

Spontaneous phone calls, whether
they be from alumni, possibly legis-
lators, administrators from other in-
stitutions, or arriving spokesmen
must be answered. In addition, the
president manages to conduct a
seminar in the Law School. There
was a time when he taught some
regular classes, but that is no longer
feasible.

Naturally, his job necessitates
close cooperation with the Board of
Trustees on all matters—develop-
ment, planning, investment, budget,
and finances. It entails his keeping
the Boatd apprised of University
activities and his keeping himself ap-
prised of the Board's activities,

The president is required to act
on seemingly infinite occasions,
playing roles of both initiator and
reactor. “There is no way the Presi-
dent has time to do everything”, ad-
mits President Huntley, but this is
viewed as inherent in the nature of
the position, Added assistants or a
change in administrative structure at
this time is no cure for this situa-
tion. Instead, emphasis has been
placed on maintaining well-estab-
lished working relationships. “It is
the nature of the University and
particular people and not so much
the actual organization that is im-
portant here,” believes President
Huntley.

In the present administrative per-
sonnel and advisors to the president,
“there is no frequent buckpassing;
our people do a very good job.”
This limits the number of “insol-
uble” problems that end up on the
president's desk considerably, Thus
there are no plans for modifications
in this arrangement which neverthe-
less keeps the president so busy, “li
is generally agreed that the system
works well for us, It is not awk.
ward.”

The alternative, of additional as
sistants like someone who would
deal with institutional research ex-
clusively, would mean “too much
insulation.” in President Huniley’s
view, This condition ef greater in-
sulation resulting from added of-
ficers is purely speculative, but does
seem reasonable speculation, A
more personal, open aimosphere is
supposedly more easily attainable
and, therefore, desirable at a small
school like Washington and Lee
than at a larger school. It seen
right then for the University to
guard against an increase in “insula

tion” whenever possible.

For many, the Board of Trustees
consists of nineteen unknowns, It
is a body physically removed from
the University most of the time,
But, its powers are very real, defin-
ite and permeative. The Board's
knowledge of the University com-
munity exceeds the community's
knowledge of it for the most part.

The size of the Board is a matter
for consideration. Presently at nine-
teen, there is the provision to aux-
ment it to a maximum of twenty-
one. The size of the Board is con-
sidered to be small enough to be
manageable, yet large enough to
provide diversity.

It matters little really how many
members are on the Board or what
diversity they provide if they do not
hold an active interest in the Uni-
versity. President Huntley is con-
vinced that the Board displays an
active interest in the University.
Dean Atwood comments, “In my
experience, this present Board is the
best board.” At the least, the Board
is the largest, most diverse, and, by
virtue of its unique decision to im-
plement a six year term member-
ship (which stipulates that trustees
are elected for a six year term, no
present or future trustee may serve
more than two terms, and that there
is mandatory retirement at the age
of seventy regardless of time served!
in place of the old voluntary retire-
ment plan, has demonstrated gen-
erous capacity for change within i's
own structure. That interest is high
among members who take their
positions seriously and not merely
in an honorific sense is best demon-
strated in the statistic that the last
time the Board failed to meet a
quorum was over four years ago.

The trustees have the ultimate
responsibility for providing leader-
ship, direction, and stability for the
University. The Board oversees every
facet of University progress—the
enrollment, faculty, facilities, and
financial resources. It is The gov-
erning board, It elects and can re-
move its own members, assigns du-
ties to all the administrative offcials
including those discussed above,
and elects a president who is chief
executive of the University.

Three formal meetings—one in
the Spring, Fall, and Winter are
held annually by the Board as a
whole. Much of the work in the in-
terim period is done by committees.
An evaluation in the 1964-66 Self
Study Report of the University stat-
ed, “It appears that compared to
governing boards of other private
institutions, the Board of Trustees
of Washington and Lee has pro-
vided effective and competent lead-
ership and is well organized to do
so in the decades ahead.” The Self-
Study Report was not without some
recommendations for even further
improving the Board, however.

lt is perhaps indicative of the
Board's active interest in the better-
ment of the institution that these
recommendations have been largely
implemented. An evaltative study
today would find, as that of 1964-
66 recommended, standing commit-
tees in areas such as development,
nominating, and finances and also a
continued policy of appointing
special commitiees to meet unusual
requirements,

In addition, there is a functioning
Executive Committee of the Board,
to which all reports on academics
are made first before being presented
to the whole Board at one of the
three annual meetings.

A primary responsibility of the
Board is that of fund-raising. Money
is raised with a heavy reliance upon
volunteers. The Board and the
President stimulate annual giving
by other volunteers, such as Pareni
Groups, Regional Groups. the State
Planning Council, and the Robert
E. Lee Associates, by their own pri-
mary examplcs of giving and will-
ingness to communicate to others,

There is a shared history of past
identification with the University
among adminisirators. All have
served the University in some capa-
city prior to their assuming their
present duties, They have not only
taught at the University at some
level in the past, but continue to do
so even while performing as Deans
Such associations foster, as Dean
John calls it, “institutional loyalty
and identification.” “It marks some
things easier and some things har
der” notes President Huntley, but
all in all it is considered a great as
sistance. The danger inherent in such
a situation is that a lack of fresh
ideas could develop, but the ad-
ministration believes it has avoided
this pitfall

There is an consensus among ad-
nunistraiors interviewed above that
the present internal structure and
communications work well, There is
a definite “personalized nature io

BY LEX McMILLAN

| read. Bob Ford’s letter in this
paper last week with a great mixture
of emotions. He raised some very
important questions concerning the
racial situation at Washington and
Lee which I feel should be care-
fully scrutinized. However, ‘there
are no easy answers to the ques-
tions. The solution of the racial
tension which is so undeniably pres-
ent here will not be easily found.
There is no easy solution; no one
action by one group will end. the
misunderstanding and __ ill-feelings
which exist between the Blacks and
Whites at W&L,

Though Mr. Ford’s letter was pri-
marily. concerned with the unen-
thusiastic response by the majority
of students to the First Annual
Black Culture Week, in a larger
sense his letter was a revealing re-
flection of the racial situation at
Washington and Lee.

He touches on a variety of re-
sponses to the ‘week’ which reflect
the variety of responses to the
Blacks at W&L. His first example
is of a racist response. It is a waste
of time to try and enlighten this sort
of individual, The malevolence and
hate which consumes the racist will
be his own reward, As he sows, so
shall he reap.

It is undeniable that there are
racists at W&L. I don’t know if we
have more than our fair share but it
is possible that a perverted under-
standing of our heritage and tradi-
tions serves to attract racists. This
is conjecture based on rather un-
scientific methodology. The point is
that we do have racists and there is
very little you can do with a firmly
convinced racist. They resist en-
lightenment with considerable ten-
acity, (Hate is a very powerful
force.)

Thus | will not concern myself
with this minority (hopefully) of
students. Rather I will address my-
self to the students whose opinions
fall somewhere between racism and
color-blindness. That is, the major-
ity of students; the mildly antagon-
istic, the indifferent and the bleed-
ing-hearts. Undoubtedly this is an
over simplification, but it repre-
sents a spectrum of racial attitudes,
which is the most realistic way to
view the situation.

Thus, just as | had ambivalent
feelings about Mr. Ford's letter, I
would say that most of W&L’s
White students’ racial opinions are
characterized by ambivalence. In
some cases the ambivalence turns
into indifference. Most White stu-
dents have no real antagonism for
the Black students, just as most have
no real dedication to racial har-
mony and understanding. Thus you
get indifference. | would say that
the indifference is an outgrowth of
ambivalence and the ambivalence a
result of uncertainty as to what
Blacks want,

Now obviously the way to dis-
cover what Blacks want is to par-
ticipate in such activities as were
offered by the Black Culture Week.
So why the poor response to this
“week”? | would say that in a sense
it was too late, Not irretrievably
late but late enough to receive an
indifferent response, But why in-
difference?

The Black Movement is old
enough to have acquired a rather
substantial history. In the course of
this history the ‘movement’ has gone
through several stages. At some

point in the struggle Whites. began
to see. the very real and. justifiable
complaints of American Blacks.

Thus, the Whites of America (not all

of them by any means) began to
gravitate toward the Blacks. Com-
munication and understanding were
hailed as means to solve the racial
problem. Integration began with the
idea of equality in terms of social,
economic and political rights and
opportunities,

The Whites who embraced integ-
ration eventually confronted a very
real shock and that is the apparent
desire of some Blacks to maintain a
cultural separatism. Thus many
Whites have experienced a certain
rejection which is hard to cope with,
They figured they'd just be human
to Blacks; treat them like you'd
treat anyone else. Then the shock-
ing realization comes that you can’t
treat them like anyone else. It is a
sort of culture shock. Mr. Ford's
use of the concepts of “Racial ident-
ity” and “Black Culture” underline
this separatism which has caused a
progression in once concerned
Whites from ambivalence to indiff-
erence.

It seems that many whites have
come to feel that whatever it is that
the Blacks want is utterly alien to
American culture. In other words,
the feeling has arisen that Blacks
want to maintain a cultural separ-
ateness to avoid becoming part of

Letters To The Editor...

The Motivation of Honor

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Mr. Small's column in the March
first edition of this paper proposed
that the key to salvaging Washing-
ton and Lee's Honor System is a
greater willingness on the part of
students to police other students.
Although such action would reduce
the amount of “lying, stealing and
cheating” I question whether such
a system could correctly be termed
an “honor system”. As Immanuel
Kant wrote in the 18th century,
“Can he be called virtuous, can he
be called honest, who would like to
yield to his favorite vices if only he
were not frightened by future pun-
ishment?”

Robert P. Beakley *72L

Advertisement Criticized

To the Editor, of the Ring-tum Phi:

won't, or can't.

And what do we see, again, in the

Never mind, at the moment, the
fact that this “reference service” of-
fers to remove the remaining chal-
lenge before students who, in large
numbers, are already functionally il-
literate. Never mind too the fact
that one of the co-sponsoring or-
ganizations claims to be “a spec-
ialized agency of the United Na-
tions dedicated to peace,” which
brings up a whole new range of
questions.

‘Middle Class Dreams”

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Incredible. Absolutely astonishing.

It is 1972 and the consciousness of
the American college student has
supposedly changed. He is “sup-
posedly” more intelligent and “sup-
posedly” more aware of what is
really important in this thing called
life.

Yet I see the appalling figures
before me. For coeducation; 438
Against coeducation 535,

Now come off it fellas. Don't you
know yet that you have been depriv
ed of a really normal life here?
Haven't you even sensed it while
freezing your posterior on the way

back to Hollins Sunday afternoons?

I won't say a whole lot here. I'm
really a bit disgusted. A week from
now I'll undoubtedly pick up a Phi
and find myself “logically” disputed
by a student who got 1500 on his
college boards, but who's never used
his brain for anything more im-
portant.

I think one of my professors made
my point perfectly today. In speak-
ing about his students of just a few
years ago, he said that he’s always
interested in seeing that they all
bought the “Middle class dream.” In
connection with two cars, status,
$25,000 a year, three screaming
kids, and cocktail parties, he said,
“They all have gorgeous wives now

. and one on the side some-
where.”

In short, these W&L gentlemen,
at 30 and 40, are still “down the
road.” After all most of them never
knew anything else about girls, Ap-
parently we aren't going to either.

THE RING-TUM PHI

BY W. PATRICK HINELY

L certainly hope Richard Nixon
relaxed his old Joe McCarthy-ish
sense of anti-communism he has
had for so long while he was visit-
ing the People’s Republic of China.
“Red” China, by the way, is an ob-
solete term. It will be in vogue
again when the Chinese begin refer-
ring to our nation as the Imperialist
States of America.

Assuming Nixon did set aside his
prejudices while in China, he could
have learned a lot. The progress
made by Mao’s government since
1949 is astounding, though not read-
ily perceptible to Americans who
have been brainwashed against see-
ing any possible good in any type
of communism.

As I watched the President tour-
ing a “model” commune near Pe-
king last week, several of my fellow
tube boobs remarked, almost in
unison, as Nixon looked around a
“typical” family home: “Ha! They
don’t even have electricity or plumb-
ing. You call THAT progress???”

Yes. When you look back half a
century or even less and compare
the way things are NOW with the
way they were THEN, it is easy to
see how far the Chinese have pro-
gressed. Their housing is not yet up
to middle American standards, but
they don’t owe mortgages to anyone.
No longer do the Chinese people
live and slave for an aristocratic
master, knowing that their children
are doomed to a similar fate. In
China, such a form of repression
was part of the government. The
nobles filled the roles of local tax
collectors and magistrates and made
the law. In America, such robbing
functions have been quite capably
filled by private corporations, with
the government backing them up.

Of course, the Chinese govern-
ment now fills the role of lord and
master, and they have propagandiz-
ed the people. Mao’s little red book

fills the place of the Bible. The gov-
ernment imposes a constant sensory
bombardment upon the people. Here
in the U.S. advertising fills a similar
function. It is merely a difference in
who controls the pap fed to the
citizenry; here it is done by con-
sumer industries, there it is the
government. However, the U.S. gov-
ernment is now collaborating openly
with private industry by using
“slick” selling methods for armed
services recruiting. Today’s Action
Army wants to enjoin you.

While Nixon was in China, he
saw what great resources of man-
power can do. When he went to the
Great Wall, itself a monument to
what great manpower can do, he
had to travel miles of road which
had been snowed under the night
before. The Chinese didn’t clear
the road with plows; they probably
don’t have any. They do have plenty
of able-bodied men, so they called
out the Chinese equivalent of the
National Guard and gave them snow
shovels.
had the techno-
logy we have, they could progress
much farther and faster than we
ever will if we continue using our
present methods, They have the
manpower to go much faster, and
the method as well. Their system is
based on teamwork and coopera-
tion. They work WITH one another
to yield the most they can for every-
one. Here in our own paradisiac
hell, the competitive system pits one
man AGAINST another.

Ihe Chinese are even getting rid
of the concept of money. Workers
earn credit points instead of yen.
The points are used to obtain need-
ed goods, and when there are points
left over, wanted goods as well, re-
ferred to in the U.S. as “luxuries.”
Like in the Soviet Union, luxury
items are usually hard to find, but
in both nations, there will be more

Stickmen Look Good In Scrimmage

BY BILL BALLARD

The springtike weather of last
week brought the upcoming lacrosse
season to the minds of several W&L
students. They recalled the pleasant
afternoons of last spring when
Washington and Lee rose to national
recognition as one of the nation’s
top teams, The outlook for the year
js just as bright.

About 30 players have been think-
ing about this season for a while
longer than the average student.
The defensemen and goalies have
been practicing since February |,
and the others have been working
out individually since February 21,
when practice officially began.

In helping prepare for the season,
the team scrimmaged Mount Wash-
ington Lacrosse Club, sort of the
Los Angeles Lakers of the lacrosse

world. Mount Washington usually
has players who were All-Ameri-
cans in college. The Saturday scrim-
mage showed that W&L has the
ability but needs a little more work.

Coach Dick Szlasa was a little
disappointed in the scrimmage, par-
ticularly the first half. He said that
“we are stronger than we showed in
the scrimmage.”

He added that “the first half was
theirs, but the second half was
ours.” This improvement toward the
end, eased some of the disappoint-
ment.

The scrimmage allowed Coach
Szlasa and Coach Bill McHenry to
try a few innovations and experi-
ment with a few players in different
positions. The game was video-tap-
ed and as a result, some plays have
been changed, Jim Farrar has been

placed on the defense, and Ed Tog-
netti has been put at midfield where
he had played before a temporary
switch to defense.

Coach Szlasa singled out the mid-
field of Ted Bauer. John Lalley and

Chip Tompkins and defenseman
Don Eavenson for their perfor-
mances Saturday. He also made

special notice of the four seniors on
the team. They have helped the
WAL go from rags to riches in la-
crosse. Team Co-Captain Scott
Neese was honorable mention All-
America, last year. Defenseman
fommy Smith has been an unher-
alded but consistently good player
for the past three years. At mid-
field, Jim “Piggy” McCane became
an outstanding player after having
played little in high school. And
the fourth, Chuck Robson, has pro-

vided leadership for the team while
backing up at goal.

Probably the two most impres-
sive members of the team are Sam
Engelhart and Skip Lichtfuss, Last
season, Engelhart was first team
All-American as a sophomore, while
Lichtfuss gained first team All-Divi-
sion as a freshman.

Depth and conditioning are the

keys to this year’s team. Coach
Szlasa expects to run three and
sometimes four midfields during

the season. He rates the midfields as
strong as any in the country. In ad-
dition, he anticipates using five de-
fensemen and attackmen almost in-
terchangeably.

With three games in four days,
this depth will be important, but
conditioning may make the differ-
ence. The outcome of the season
could hinge on someone receiving
or avoiding an injury.

This Saturday, the team journeys
to Colege Park, Md., to scrimmage
the University of Maryland. Mary-
land was runnerup to Cornell in the
national tournament, last year. Al-
though it is a scrimmage and will
not count for or against WAL’s rec-
ord, the team will prepare for it as
if it were a regular season game.
This scrimmage will be the last test
before the regular season; the Yale
session had to be called off because
of a conflict in Yale's schedule.

Solution for Racial Situation Suggested

(Continued from page 3)

the hodge-podge of American soc-
iety. Ostensibly they fear being
dominated by the White culture.
This is a reasonable fear but it is
unlikely that a minority as large and
as self-aware as American Blacks
could be eclipsed by the so-called
dominant White culture,

| would rather not plunge into the
argument surrounding the above
issue. The point is that as long as
many Whites at W&L encounter
hostility from Blacks it is unlikely
that any interest in “what Blacks
want” will arise, If White students
feel threatened and see separatism
in the activity of the Blacks, it is
unlikely that any barriers will be
broken down and any understand-
ing achieved.

Now the obvious response to this
is that the Blacks do not feel hostile
nor remain separate by choice but
rather as a reaction to hostility and
separatism on the part of the Whites.
And thus we get to a chicken and

egg question as far as the W&L
community 1s concerned, with good
reason to believe that the Whites
instigated the cycle.

Thus, it becomes imperative for
the cycle to be broken because it is
endless. How to break out? The an-
swer is not new and it is the point
of this column. Obviously human
charity is the only solution. This
will take courageous action. It will
require White students to offer
themselves while fearing rejection
and Black students to accept while
fearing insincerity and ulterior mo-
tives. In other words, a concerted
effort at mutual trust. This can not
possibly be easy, but it is impera-
tive.

This is an urgent call for under-
standing. The Blacks at W&L must
know that all White students don’t
resent them, don’t hate them, and
don’t desire to see them suppressed.
Most are indifferent and though
better than hate, it will not do,
What is required is not a commit
ment to social crusading. Racial har-
mony will not be the result of reach-
ing out for organization but of per-
sonal action.

It has been a long battle, It might
never end, There are no winners,
Surely we are weary. Cannot we
now put down the hateful swords
and simply begin to live together?

If you didn’t work, you didn’t get

The usual assessments of the
People’s Republic of China in the
U.S., to this point in time, have
been, on the whole, pretty unfavor-
able. The general line of reasoning,
or more appropriately, UN-reason-
ing, has been much like that of the
lV viewers | mentioned earlier.

Theirs is a_ basically one-sided,
ignorant, and therefore wrong point
of view from which to approach the
subject .If you compare the pro-
gress of the Chinese nation from
1949 to the present with the pro-
gress of the United States from the
Revolution (that is, the FIRST
American Revolution) up to about
1815, which is an equivalent amount
of time, you can easily see that the
Chinese have progressed much fas-
ter.

Some would agree that they have
had more manpower and_techno-
logy to work with than we did in
our nation’s early years. This is
true. However, the Chinese have
an immensely greater number of
people than we did. So I think the
comparison will show that the Chin-
ese have done much better than we
did. This is a great blow to our na-
tional ego, but the truth sometimes
hurts things like the ego.......

The Chinese have gone farther in
23 years than we did in 80 or 90.

only looked, but saw. Not only
heard, but listened. He had a mar-
velous opportunity,

the education and contacts” at
Washington and Lee according to
Dean John. The school is small
enough so that a great degree of in-
formal communication is possible—
not only between administrators but
also between them and other mem-
bers of the University community.

The abundance of communica-
tions channels at Washington and
Lee creates, at least, the feeling, if
not the actuality, that one’s ideas
and opinions and complaints are
considered seriously and sincerely.
The actuality that the University is
indeed receptive is best demon-
strated in the nature of reforms that
have taken place at the school over
the past few years. Relaxation of
parietals, revised curriculum, new
course offerings, the exchange pro-
gram, and the new $56-million
building program are some of the
examples of how the administra-
tion—from the trustees on down—
have responded to the need for
change.

If the actuality (and, too, the feel-
ing) of competence, flexibility and
concern on the part of the admini-
stration are not evident to or realiz-
ed by a segment of the University
community, the cries of the dis-
pleased have been faint and few.
There is an obvious but not ob-
structive air of confidence and op-
timism on the part of administrators
themselves with regard to the job

Dr. Linton Lomas Barrett, a
professor of romance languages,
critic and translator, died Wed-
nesday in Charlottesville follow-
ing a long illness. He was 67.

Only last year Dr. Barrett had
been named cooridnator of an
innovative program funded part-
ly by a grant from the National
Endowment for the Humanities
and the Council on Library Re-
sources, seeking to design a
method to increase the Washing-
ton and Lee student's familiar-
ity with the resources and serv-
ices available in the university
library system.

Dr. Barrett was the author or
translator of more than a dozen
major volumes, including 10
novels, histories and texts trans-
lated from the Portuguese, Most
recently he was translator of
“The Americas and Civiliza-
tion” by Darcey Ribiero and au-
thor of “A Simplified Approach
to Don Quixote.”

He is survived by his widow,
the former Miss Marie McDavid,
who collaborated with him on
several translations; and two
children, Arthur Lomas Barrett
of New Jersey and Ellen Marie
Barrett, a graduate student at
New York University.

The family has asked that in
licu of flowers donations be
made either to the R. E. Lee
Church or to the Botetourt-
Rockbridge Regional Library.

Born in Lanett, Ada., Septem-
ber 1, 1904, he earned his de-
grees from Mercer University,
the University of Virginia, and
the University of North Caro-
lina. Prior to joining Washington
and Lee’s faculty in 1948, Dr.
Barrett taught at Virginia, Ala-
bama, Furman, Princeton and
Kansas.

He was head of the romance
languages department at Wash-
ington and Lee for 10 years until
his retirement from adminisira-
tive duties two years ago.

the winner edged past opponent
Archer Frierson by 23 votes,

Meanwhlie campaigning is under-

The last minute canrpaigning by
Frierson and his unexpected endorse-

vote gap between Merrill and Frier-

pressed concern and anger over the
Frierson endorsements, considering
them to be “dirty politics.” The final
vote count, with only 525 students
voting, was Bill Merrill 274 to Ar-

opponem, Jim Farrar, did not ap-
pear on the ballot. However, the
final vote gave Taylor a big lead
over all contetnders with a total of
281 votes to that of 86 for all write-
ins, Fewer students voted in the
Dance Board contest than in the
EC race.

The President-elect of the EC Bob
Brennan, has begun to assume the
responsibilities of his new office by
attending a Faculty EC meeting
concerning the future of the inde-
pendent examinations. Brennan re-
ported that the faculty agreed to

cep the independent examinations
on a trial basis. ,

Later, Brennan explained that the
independent examinations are. still
being conducted as an experiment.
He pointed out that they were not
permanent and have not proved

mselves to the faculty as of yet.
When asked how the faculty arrives
upon a judgment concerning the
future of the independent examina-
lions, Brennan said that the faculty
takes into consideration the opinions
of the students along with their own
personal observations.

Brennan expressed his opinion
that by keeping the independent ex-
aminations on a trial basis, students
will be less likely to take advantage
of them. “Right now, it is in the
hands of the students whether or
not they want to keep independent
exams. The most important thing
for the students to realize is that
they (independent exams) are not
permanem and can be lost,” Bren-
nan noted,

Commenting on the transfer of
the Freshman orientation back to

Natural Bridge for next year, Bren-
nan said, “I think it will help, The
Administration has told us that dur-
ing orientation is the time when
the new Freshman are the most in-
terested in learning about the school,
so that it is the best time to tell
them about the Honor System.”

Pointing towards a theme of the
new EC Brennan said, “What we
are trying to do is to bring the EC
back to the student level.” He ex-
pressed the concern that the EC
must become. involved in student
life and not exist as a group above
the students, Brennan said that some
people do just what they think is
better for them and have no regard
for others. He called for a “sense of
community” which would give new
life to the school. Brennan stated
that the maltreatment of the facili-
ties in the Student Center is an ex-
ample of what is wrong at W&L.
He explained,” A student can not
put himself first; this campus be-
longs to all, it is not the possession
of any individual.”

Candidates for Class offices and
EC posts were announced during
the Monday night EC meeting. They
are for Sophomore Class President:
Bill Lassetter, Chip Martin, Duke
Stevens, and Bill Biesel; for Sopho-
more V.P.: Michael Kurilecz, John

OUTLOOK and REVIE

Washington and Lee is joining a novel athletic associa-

    

tion, the Virginia College Athletic Association, The move is
engineecred-to “encourage more play among the natural intra-
state rivals.” according to W&L Athletic Director Bill. Me-
Henry. At least for the time being, the Generals will remain
associated with their current athletic conference, the College
\thletic Conference.

Actually) Washington’ and Lee: has been=a principal -pro-
ponent for this new "state-wide association Bill MeHenry ts
the group's interim vice president.

Nine schools will be VCAA members: W&L, Lynchburg,
Emory and Henry, Hampden-Sydney, Madison, Clinch Valley,
Roanoke, St. Paul's, and Hampton Institute. ‘The association
has no word from Christopher Newport, Eastern Ménnonite,
George Mason and Randolph-Macon, which have all been
approached, The criteria for membership include that the
school have a male enrollment under 2000; plus be a member
of the National Collegiate Athletic Association or the Na-
tional Association of Intercollegiate..\thleties.. Under these
euidelines Virginia Union, Virginia Wesleyan and) Luther
Rice would be eligible to join. VMI, a Southern Conference
school, has declined an offer to join.

and soccer, Association teams will not “be required: to play
one-another but increased scheduling among. VCAA members
is likely. McHenry reported, “We don't intend to set up the
sort of organization which would be telling people whom they
had. to play. We have too many different kinds of schools in
the state to try and do anything like that.”

The VCAA planners anticipate all-association teams and
championships. Because a football tournament is impossible,
a committee vote might decide the top team. .\ field of four
teams could be chosen for an association tournament in base-
ball and basketball. All other sports could cap off their season
with two day meets for all teams.

Washington and Lee has acted sensibly in joining the
VCAA vanguard: The University has plenty to gain by sign
ing uprand very little to lose. W&L does not have to sacrifice
its standing in the CAC. The scheduling problems might be
cased, especially in sports other than football, basketball and
lacrosse, with a statewide association of nine schools. All
VCAA teams will give outstanding W&L athletes a degree
of recognition that does not presently exist. Travel costs can
be immensely trimmed by playing teams closer to Lexington,

Certainty’ someof the Blue's fans might question this as-
sociation. They might wonder what W&L has in common
with many of these institutions except geography. The col-
leges in the VCAA are diverse in scholarship policy, admis-
sions standards and academic credibility. But recall that

W@L: Where It Has Been, Where It 1s Going... -

Library Facilities Evaluated

With the announcement of a new
$5.25 million undergraduate library
as part of W&L’s $56 million deve-
lopment program, it is appropriate
to examine the resources and prob-
lems of the current library system
and to see how well it is accomplish-
ing its goats,

“Fundamental to all other aspira-
tions of Washington and Lee are two
basic purposes:

—The dedication of all its re-
sources to the development of
man’s capacity and desire to learn,
to understand and to pass on to
others the varied benefits of this
intellectual growth.

more problem which is very ap-
parent when the harmonies of the
piano ring throughout the building.

Some limited changes are planned
in the present facilities, but there is
no intention to invest a large sum
of money with the new library on its
way. Air conditioning will be in-
stalled in the rare book room and
additional lights will be installed,
while more painting will be done
throughout the library, The one
major renovation of space will be
to create better shelving space for
new books within the limitations
of the present facilities, For ex-
ample, in the archive and rare book

 

McCormick Library will be renovated to house the School of Com-
merce, Economics, and Politics following completion of the new library.

~The pursuit of its educational
purpose in a climate of learning
that stresses the importance of
the individual, his personal honor
and integrity, his harmonious re-
lationship with his fellow man,
and his responsibility to serve
society through the productivity
of his training and talent.”
Certainly the central goal of W&L’s
library system is to support the siat-
ed aspirations of the University and
to be the central area for intellectual
advancement. Also the library seeks
“to support the intangible
cultural forces of the University.
—to create an environment
which is conducive to learning,
to developing decision-making
skills, and to the enrichment of
the total man.
to support the development
of inter-library agreements.”
McCormick Library was built ori
ginally in 1908 and was extensively
remodeled in 1941, The inadequacy
of the physical plant was seen dur
ing the preparation for the Self-
Study Report of Washington and
Lee University of 1964-66 and was
further substantiated in 1968 by a
leading library architect, Russell
Bailey, and in 1969 by Ralph Ells
worth, a professional library con
sultant, each of whom recommended
a new library
The simple lack of space in Me
Cormick and the six departmental
libraries is the most noticeable prob
lem in the current structures, Me
Cormick has room for approximate
ly 20,000 more volumes before
shelves will begin to line even the
office of the Librarian, Mr. Maurice
Leach. Also, comfortable and effic
ient working quarters for the faculty
and staff members are desperately
lacking. as evidenced by the moving
of the microfilm out of the biblio

graphy room to the rear of the
smaller study area on the main
floor, The staff is also seriously

hampered by lack of space on the
ground floor where the magazines
are checked in and the cataloguing
is done, Because of the architectural
design of the wails, which prohibits
fundamental altermtions in the sizes
of the Toonnm, fhe space is too com

The Self-Study Report recom
mended the completion of the sixth
jack level by the installation of
storage type shelving, which would
provide space for about 40,000 vol
umes, However, Mr. Leach explain
ed that this alteration would be im

room new shelving will be added
for books from the fifth level of
the stacks.

The new library will hopefully
solve all of these problems and
provide facilities for much better
service. Regarding the progress with
the planning of the new facility
Mr. Leach stated, “We hope to have
the schematic drawings for the
building completed this Spring.
Once they are completed it will take
somewhere between a year and 18
months for what they call the speci-
fication drawings. Then assuming
that bids are let and the financing
complete it will take roughly two
years after that to complete the
building. Our original timetable is
geared to moving into the new
building in the summer of 1975, It
would be determined ultimately by
the financing of the building. There
is a reasonable sum of money al-
ready committed towards this end;
its roughly a third.”

Mr. Leach emphasized that the
basic idea of the new library will
be “to open up the library in the
sense of making the book and study
facilities available to the user in
one place. Le. we dont want to
create the barriers that the walls do
at the present time between the ref-
erence room and where the bound
magazines are shelved for example.”
Thus an integrated bookstack and
reading area will comprise the bulk
of the building. To provide ade
quate room for future acquisitions,
the new library will accommodate
$00,000 volumes, excluding the
Law Library

Seating will be provided for 800
patrons compared to about 530 in
the present facilities, Three-quarters
will be individual
carrels which will be less distracting
to the person studying and part of
them will be wired to enable use of
tapes or possibly T.V. in the future
Opening off the stacks will be semi

lt is projected that a staff of 40

As President Huntiey indicated, the
new Hbrary will be behind Wash
ington Mall going down into the
valley. lt will be comparable to the

Doremus Gymnasium in width and

depth, so to prevent it from tower
ing over Washington Hall and the
Colonnade, it will go no higher than
the first floor of Washington Hall
Whether the facilty will go down
three or five floors will be deter
mined by rock borings which are

wheduled to begin shortly

Microfilm facilities will be en
poured, but Ht is dewhful that WAI
will turn to the film type of book

March 15, 1972

in the near future, which large uni-
versity libraries are beginning to
use, This decision is based on three
factors, The cost is prohibitive for
sets of books as the Encycleopedia
Britannica, i.e. ten cents a page and
thus a $40 investment for a 400
page book. Other microfilm books
are much cheaper but the problem
is the different equipment and the
staff needed to service the material.
It is not feasible to make this equip-
ment available on a_ self-service
basis. Also because Lexington is
isolated, repair workmen must be
called from Roanoke, Lynchburg, or
Charlottesville. Finally, the library
staff feels students and faculty mem-
bers prefer to handle books over
film at the present.

One of the more controversial as-
pects of the plans for the new
library is the eventual elimination
of the separate departmental facili-
ties, excluding the Law School.
There are no objections to the de-
centralized concept itself, but pro-
fessional service can't be rendered
effectively at the separate locations
and it would be more economical
to run a unified system. However,
no department will be forced to
consolidate its present holdings, but
Mr, Leach hopes they will all be
persuaded to do so, Only the Com-
merce School has consented to this
proposal so far, The departments
will be encouraged to keep “current
awareness collections” —_ including
periodicals for five to ten years,
standard reference works, and biblio-
graphical resources,

The Self-Study Report emphasiz-
ed two areas: outside the « physical
plant that needed much improve-
ment. These were the inadequacy of
the staff in terms of numbers and
the insufficient budget. At the time
of the report there were four pro-
fessional workers and two full-time
and four ‘part-time non-professional
adults. Today the staff has been in-
creased to six professionals and 12
supporting staff members. Mr. Leach
feels that this number is adequate
for McCormick Library, although
proper service for the departmental
libraries cannot be provided at the
same time. Thus considerable im-
provement can be noted in this cate-
gory.

Regarding the budget expenditures
for the library Mr. Leach feels that
“the University has supported the
library well.” The Southern Associa-
tion of Colleges and Schools recom-
mended that at least 5°, of the
total educational and general ex-
penditures of the University should
be allotted for library expenses. In
1964-65 3.3°7 of this general bud-
get went to support the library,
while in 1970-71 this figure had in-
creased to 56°). Even book ex-
penditures rose from $44,834 in
1967 to $100,534 in 1969-70, This
increase has been needed and should
continue if only to combat the forces
of inflation alone. For instance, the
average price of books in general
increased from $11.60 in 1970-71 to
$13.50 in 1971-72, a rise of 17°).

The Self-Study Report also rec-
ommended that attempts be made to
utilize any possible federal funds
Over a five year period beginning
in 1966-67 the library was given a
total of just over $31,000 by the
federal government. However, as of
this year, W&L no longer meets the
requirements necessary to receive
these funds, Because of a decrease
in the allotment of such funds in
the federal budget the qualifications
were tightened, The funds are now
used primarily in “economically-de-
prived” library situations,

The Librarian, Vir, Maurice Leach

Regarding the number of periodi-
cals available in the library, Mr.
Leach admitted the number is low
compared to most other similar in-
stitutions but he insisted that no
real complaints have been heard
from the students or faculty. The
faculty members are given the op-
portunity to check the lists of peri-
odicals in their field and to recom-
mend others each year. W&L does
subscribe to 768 periodicals by title,
and Mr. Leach noted that they are
the most expensive purchases since
they must be continued,

Attempts are being made to ex-
pand the special services rendered
by the library to the University com-
munity. One of the most important,
is in the area of inter-library agree-
ments. For at least 40 years VMI
and W&L have exchanged the au-
thor entries in the card catalogues
of each school, and it has been
agreed that each library will loan
materials on an equal basis. In
special collection purchases, if one
of the libraries has the item, then
the other will not buy it. Also the
George Marshall Library at VMI is
encouraging W&L students to use
its facilities.

Another inter-library agreement is
the Inter-Library Loan System, Un-
der this setup books are exchanged
upon request with almost any library
in the country. The service is limit-
ed however primarily to students en-
gaged in research work, as for honor
theses. W&L borrows an extensive
number of books from the Univer-
sity of Virginia, while demands
made on W&L’s books are rare. Mr.
Leach plans to issue a small hand-
book this Spring which will em-
phasize the availability of this serv-
ice. Hopefully it will be made ac-
cessible to more students in the
future.

Another example of increased in-
ter-library cooperation was exhibited
just a couple of weeks ago when
Dr. Steven McCarthy, the Execu-
tive Director of the Association of
Research Libraries spoke on issues
confronting libraries, which atiract-
ed a large number of staff members
of libraries around the state.

Mr. Leach noted that there have
been no recent complaints concern-
ing the hours that McCormick is
open for use. Extended hours are
provided during the exam periods,
and the library no longer closes on
the Saturdays of football weekends
or Fancy Dress, as it did at one
time.

A completely new program aimed
at bringing about a more effective
and efficient use of the library re-
sources by students and their pro-
fessors will begin this Spring with a
matching $50,000 grant from the
Council on Library Resources of
the National Foundation of Hu-
manities. The five year program as-
sumes that few undergraduates have
a great deal of bibliographical skill.
A course will be offered, called In
terdepartmental 190, which will at-
tempt to make the student aware of
all the library's reference services
and inter-library loan arrangements
especially in his own particular field
of study, Instruction will be given
jointly by the library staff and the
faculty of the individual Jepart-
mens, Courses will be given this
Spring by the departments of Eco-
nomics, Spanish, French, and Ger-
man, but the program will ultimate-
ly invelve more of the areas in the
Humanities and the Social Sciences.
Student assistants will be selected to
receive additional training and will
be paid to work at the reference

Letters To The Editor...

Power To The People!
To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

One truly, truly sympathizes with
the indignant junior whose letter ap-
peared in the Phi March 8, and
with the Student E.C. and indeed
with all advocates of coeducation
at W&L who imagined that the re-
cent referendum on the matter
would go their way. What we saw
here last week was another remind-
er of one of the great revelations of
modern American (and Western)
politics, viz., that the elite—the
political “classe dirigente,” the in-
telligentsia, the “socially conscious”
Jaycees and other businessmen of
the “relevant” sort—is almost al-
ways well to the left of the popula-
tion as a whole. It’s a puzzling state
of affairs for all concerned. Why,
one positively hestitates to poke fun
at democracy these days; King De-
mos is usually on one’s own side.
Evidently Disraeli knew what he
was talking about after all,

Many politicos, unfortunately,
have grasped what is happening
(even though the sponsors of the
coed referendum failed to). Just a
week ago the Virginia legislature
turned down a _ referendum bid,
aware that the voters would over-
ride an important decision which

force through. Earlier, Senator Fred
Harris underscored this point in a
memorable speech at the University
of Maryland (June, 1968). And the
zealots of radical chic will tell you
any day that the intellectual-litenary
clite knows best, and that the re-
actionary demos is a blind beast.
Alas, the organizers of the referen-
dum on coeducation have probably
learned their lesson too well; when
they are themselves community
leaders, years from now, they'll
know better (unless they turn con-
servative in the meantime) than to
trust “the people” to support “pro-
gressive” causes, The next step, no
doubt, is for the Right to take over
the New Left slogan: Power to the
people!

Endorsement Criticized

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:
It was with a sense of regret that
I read the statements by Messrs.
Azuma and Robinson endorsing one
of the two candidates for Vice-Presi-
dent in last Thursday’s run-off elec-
tion, Such an endorsement is, in my
opinion, regrettable for two reasons:
1.) in an election process such as
that for the position of Executive
Committee V.P., that is one in
which there are no parties per se,
this kind of partisanship on the part
of those already in office is out of
place; 2.) such a statement provides
a supposed guide to those unfamil-
iar with the candidates in that it is
expected, or at least insinuated, that
those who signed such a statement
being elected officials should know
which is better. Being blind by their
own officialdom this is often not the
case, As it turns out, the W&L stu-
dent body has more intelligence than
Messrs. Azuma and Robinson would
give it credit for having: the record
of this year’s E.C. officers obviously
did not carry enough weight to lend
substance to their recommendations
and the candidate opposing their en-
dorsee has won. I hope that he will
exhibit more good sense and tact
during next year’s elections than did
the current President and Vice-Presi-
dent of our Executive Committee.

Liberal Arts Education?

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

With the announcement of the
new $56 million building program,
it would appear that the individuals
governing this university are making
a great effort to make W&L a na-
tional institution, Although I ad-
mire these men for their dedication
my strongest wish is that they would
take time to study why W&L fails in
its attempt to provide a liberal arts
education.

Every breath that this university
takes reflects its desire to cater to
the needs of a professional institute.
Questionnaires given to entering
freshmen show an unusually * high
percentage of W&L students desir-
ing to become lawyers, doctors, and
businessmen, The wishes of those
departments catering to these stu-
dents receive top priority. Shall we
ever see the day when W&L grants
the art, music, and drama depart-
ments the recognition and financial
support such departments receive at
more progressive universities?

The neglect of the philosophy
basic to this institution has resulted
in an administration, faculty, and
student body devoid of any creativ-
ity and characterized by a lack of
imagination,

One need not go past first semes-
ter of freshman year to discovet

that students are seldom, encouraged
to use their minds unless it is to me-
morize that “all important list” soon
forgotten. Teachers who do open up
their classes to discussion are often
puzzled by the lack of interest de-
monstrated by the students. Stu-
dents seldom take the time to even
return course evaluations distribut-
ed by a teacher,

This letter is not solely condemn-
ing the faculty, for the student body
presents a fairly bizarre picture in
itself. Living within a system so
strongly oriented to grades and
grinding, one naturally looks upon
those things he truly enjoys as hav-
ing little intellectual value. Educa-
tion cannot function when pleasure
is removed, Not only does the abil-
ity to learn decrease but what then
is the answer?

Student and teacher should co-
operate to find what they both de-
sire from their educational inter-
course, Course format should be
open to constructive criticism. Ex-
perimentation with student-initiated
courses might result in an improved
course selection for the whole Uni-
versity, While the independent study
program freed from rigorous con-
trol dutifully provided by bureau-
cratic committees would allow stu-
dents to pursue personal interests.
Professors who realize this need are
now forced to cover for students
who wish to initiate their own sub-
ject material. The sad fact is that
these are the students who are seek-
ing an education and their needs are

LaRue’s Pressbox
Honor System and Jocking it Up

BY BOB “Lash” LARUE

his column should be the last
place that anyone would find a dis-
cussion of the Honor System. In-
deed, some might even look upon
this space as a refuge from the
heady stuff on page one. Yet here
it is on the sports page. What con-
nection does the Honor System have
to do with jocking it up?

While articles have been disap-
pearing from the campus with some
frequency in recent years, the Ath-
letic Department has remained re-
markably free of major thefts. Un-
til now, that is. In the last two
weeks, several items have been “li-
berated” from the locker area be-
neath the stadium. Although none
of the items are expensive by them-
selves, the sum of their loss easily
‘xceeds $100. Missing are a half
dozen wool and cotton undershirts,
known as “fifty-fifties”, which sell
for ten dollars each; several baseball
caps at about three and a half dol-
lars each; a number of cotton under-
shirts, five dollars apiece and untold

belts, and even a pair of baseball
shoes
This equipment was removed

from the players’ lockers or from
the table on which some of it was
piled. Hung up one day, gone the
next, why? Probably for the novelty
of having taken something, or per-
haps to have something emblematic
of W&L. That is, | doubt that any
of the goods will wind up in a pawn
shop, deposited by a cash-short thief

These five-fingered discounts were

most likely students who felt they
had better use for the articles stolen
than did the players.

And still is ask, why? I mean, I
understand (sort of) the motive, but
the reasoning is unfathomable. What
is it about people that allows them
to walk in, see something they like,

W&L. To Host: NCAA
Championship Thursday

The NCAA | College Division
Swimming. championships open. this
Thursday in the new W&L natator-
ium. Bim Clark and. Bill Brother-
ton in the freestyles along with the
440 freestyle relay, composed of
Clark, Brotherton, Sharp and Cat-
lin, will. represent the mighty Blue
against 375 of the top college divi-
sion swimmers in the country.

Bill Milne,.a sophomore. at Johns
Hopkins University, is entered in
six events this. weekend.

Milne has the best time recorded
this year in six events. And in most
cases his nearest. competitor is sev-
eral seconds., behind him. For in-
stance, in the 400-yard individual
medley, Milne is seeded No. 1 with
a time of 4:18.1. His closest com-
petitions No, 2 seed Dean Hardy of
the University of South Florida,
whose best time is 4:26.9.

In the 500-yard freestyle, Milne
has recorded a 4:48.0. The next best
time is 4:54.2 by Alan Cardwell of
the University of Alaska.

Because of Milne, Johns Hopkins
is a strong contender for national
team honors, along with last year’s
defending national champion,
University of California at Irvine.
Other strong favorites are Eastern
Michigan, Springfield, Kenyon and
South Florida, which was runner-up
to UCal-Irvine last year.

Individuals who are expected to
place high, besides Milne, include
Kenyon’s Richard James, South
Florida's Ricke Morehead, Mark
Roy of Monmouth, Jeff Rogers of
Ashland, Western. Illinois’ Ramsey
VanHorn, Jim Fergus and Jim
Cooper of UCal-Irvine, Steve Bat-
tin, Jerry Roster and Jeff Lamb of

Chico State, Antherst’s Gary. Haag,
Mark Horning of Johns Hopkins,
Pete Sansone .of Springfield,..Haru
Naito of Oneonta, State. and + Deni-
son's Henry: Netthing.

Springfield will be heavily favored
in the relay. events, having posted
the best times-this. year .in both the
400-yard medley relay and the 400-
yard freestyle relay. Their. strongest
competition. is expected to come
from the :relay.. teams of Eastern
Michigan, UCal-Irvine,» Kenyon,
Williams and Chico. State.

Top divers entered include Steve
Jackson of UCal-Davis, Jim Mac-
Beth of Eastern Michigan, John
O'Neal of Illinois-Chicago  Cirele,
Steve Reeves of Wayne State and
Monmouth’s Allan Frederick. and
Buddy Gregory.

Milne already holds two records

Lacrosse Opens Season,
Roanoke Here Friday

BY BILL BALLARD

Friday afternoon, the lacrosse
team opens its season in the friendly
confines of Wilson Field against
Roanoke College. WAL did not lose
at home last year, but Coach Dick
Szlasa is concerned about the first
four games, all at home. He em-
phasized that not one of these is an
cusy game.

Despite the fact that W&L beat
Roanoke in a scrimmage last year,
and again this fall, Roanoke is not
a team to be underestimated. They
are loaded with underclassmen,
who showed a lot of composure in
a loss to Duke. Following the bus
trip to Raleigh, Roanoke gave up
five quick goals but buckled down to
play Duke even for the remaining
three quarters of the game.

Williams, likewise, looked good
while playing under adverse condi
tions. They scrimmaged Hofstra,
who was in the national tournament
last year, at Hofstra on Astro-turf.
The game is apparently very differ-
ent on this type of surface, yet Wil-
liams Jost just 3-1, They have a
sophomore all-division goalie, a
solid defense and will run three mid-
fields, deep by any standards.

The third opponent in four days
is Ohio State, While many people
do not regard midwestern lacrosse
too highly, they may recall that
WAL held a few scrimmages against
Ohio State, about three yoars ago,
and never beat them. Ohio State
had a 7-4 record last season and
can be counted on to have a supply
of good athletes who will run and

hit.

Although the fourth game, against
University of Maryland, Baltimore
County, is only eight days after the
first, the two which intervene are
enough to make it seem like a dis-
tant contest, Coach Szlasa feels that
these four will set the tone for the
season, Despite the exam and spring
break, the teams lessons will carry
over.

One lesson it should have learned
is the value of running. In scrim-
mage Saturday, Maryland came out
running and ran until they went in,
The scrimmage proved worthwhile
by allowing mistakes to be made
now rather than in a game. Coach
Szlasa said that the defensemen,
John Rogers, Tommy Smith, Jimmy
Farrar and especially Don Eaver-
son, played well. In the goal, Skeet-

er Chadwick had a much better day
than against Mount Washington.
Disappointment lay in the perfor-
mance of the midfields, supposedly
the strength of the team. John Lal-
ley proved an exception to this, and
the relocation of Ed Tognetti at mid-
field seems to have the right move.

Monday's game against Williams
has a special meaning to Coach
Bill McHenry. He was head lacrosse
coach there ,for three years, turning
out a good record and some excel-
lent players. While at Williams, he
was selected as head coach of the
North All-Stars in the North-South
game and faced a South squad
headed by his brother, Bob.

The first three games, on week-
days, will begin at 3:15, and the
fourth, on Saturday ,will begin at
2:00.

Ruggers Fall to Old Dominion,

The WAL Rugby team bounced
back from their 11-10 defeat at the
hands of Old Dominion to crush
previously undefeated University of
N.C, 18-12 this past Saturday, but
fell to Duke the following day as
a combination of injuries and fati-
gue plus a strong, fresh Blue Devil
team led to numerous errors and a
40-3 drubbing.

Saturday, led by backs Tom Bar

ton and rookie Lat Purser, the Gen-
erals got two breakaway scores as

in the dust of a poorly kept field,

Track Opens
March 22 Here

BY HUD ALLENDER

Coming off an encouraging indoor
season, the Washington and Lee
track team should_offer stiff competi-
tion to those it will meet on the
track and. in the  fielg. this Spring.
Coach Norris Aldridge and his
squad have developed a number of
bright prospects which promise to
reverse the previous trend in W&L
track. We have some definite win-
ners.

The indoor season has served in
the past as basically a prelude to
the outdoors in the Spring. How-
ever, this winter has proivded our
track fortunes with some highlights
in its own right, At the Lynchburg
College Invitational Indoor Relays
on February 26, the Generals took
an overall fourth place in the six
team field. However, it was. more
the individual performances which
were encouraging.

In a day of team reldy action the
Blue harriers started off on a su-
perb note by taking the mile relay
in a good time of 3:39.8. The team
of Tim Fowler, Steve Darsie, Dave
Lawson, and Brandon Herbert fin-
ished well ahead of the other teams
teams in the impressive victory.
This same quartet in a tri-meet last
week again at Lynchburg College
bested the field and coasted to an

isy 3:38.6 victory. They capped
off the indoor season last week at
the State Meet at VMI in good form
with a fourth place finish in the
State in an excellent 3:32.0, The
emergence of a formidable mile re-
lay team is a just indication of the
improving fortune in W&L track.

Another reversal of previous per-
formance is the strong dominance
of the track over the field events.
The best we could muster up in the
tri-meet at Lynchburg in filed events
was a fourth place-in the high jump.
On the track, however, Bob Sher-
wood won the mile in a convineing
4:39.1, Brandon Herbert and Dave
Lawson finished one-two in the
600-yd. dash. Freshman Tim Fowler
looked good in the hurdles with a
second in the 60 highs and a third
in the 60 lows. Stu Nibley and
Sherwood teamed up for a first and
a fifth, respectively in the two-mile.
Captain Steve Darsie led freshman
Harrison Turnbull to a two-three
finish in the half. The excellent track
performances will be. equalled in
the field events. Coach Aldridge
feels, when all our field events can
come around outside,

The new season promises to be
an exciting one with a realistic slate
f opponents. Sherwood and Nibley
will be tough men to beat in the
long distances, as will Bill Kalal in
the three-mile. Johnny Newman,
Phifler Helms, and Dave Estes will
hold down the sprints. Darsie and
Keith Shaner, once he gets healthy
again, will run the half. Fowler will
icam up with Bill Wallace to pre-
sent quite a headache to opposition
rdiers, Other solid performances
are expected from Captain John
“the Sloth” Glace in just about any-

pointed by the President with the
advice of the E.C, also serve on the
committee. This group is concerned
with the development of general
policies while operational decisions
remain in the hands of the Librarian,
Although book selection is primar-
ily in the hands of the faculty, stu-
dents can recommend the purchase
of books through the use of the sug-
gestion box in the library.

In general W&L’s library system
compares favorably with schools of
a similar size. In terms of the num-
ber of volumes and __ periodicals,
WA&L has fewer than small northern
schools, but among similar southern
schools the library stands high. For
instance, compared to our 235,000
books and bound periodicals, Am-
herst has 449,321, Bucknell 374.,-
803, Vassar 416,338, Franklin and

Marshall 212,586, Dickinson 202,-
633, Davidson, 172,893, Hollins
122,225, and Randolph-Macon
120,139,

Washington and Lee does have
one big advantage over most of
these schools. That is the Honor

System. Because of a greater re-
spect for library material, W&L
students enjoy the easiest access to
the stacks of any library Mr. Leach
knows. However, if trends continue,
this tradition may slowly die. The
number of missing books and the
amount of mutilation has been in-
creasing. In the inventory conducted
in 1969 for the previous twenty year
period, 2200 books were missing.
In 1971 an inventory covering the
preceeding two years revealed 1300
books were missing. One result
of this trend has been _ the
locking of the stack doors in
the locking of the stack doors on
the ground floor at 5:00 each day. If
necessary Mr. Leach says they could
revert to the practice of allowing
only one entrance to the stacks at
all times, that being directly behind
the circulation desk. Ultimately if
the situation were to grow intoler-
able a guard could be employed to
check all books at the front door,
a practice which many libraries at
big universities are already using.
Hopefully student integrity will re-
main high enough so that such a
drastic measure will never be neces-
sary.

With the current plans for a new
library the physical deficiencies of
McCormick will soon be remedied
and the present budget appears to
be more in line with the goals of
the University. Although the library
system is not free of problems,
with the continued efforts by its staff
to extend its services and resources
McCormick Library is moving clos-
er to its goal of supporting and en-
couraging imellectual growth.

which is purporting to provide a lib-

Occasionally, friends who are in-

ask for advice in selecting a college.
Until faculty and students here can
come together to develop a truly

one reply I can give: look else-

scrum and the ability of the offense
to keep Carolina pinned in their
own territory. Despite a comeback
effort by the Tar Heels which
brought the bulge down to six,
W&L won the day due to the fine
team play of both scrum and backs.
At Duke the game was really
over in the first ten minutes of play
as the Blue Devils put across 15
points before the Generals’ defense
could adjust. Duke, led by wrestling
coach Bill Harvey, known in area
rugby circles as the “Silver Fox,” is
undefeated in four games and has
yet to have a goal scored on them.
Creditable performances were
turned in by president Bill Ander-
son who filled in at fullback, Ron
Vaught, a substitute wing, and
scrummers Bob Deaderick, Al Mec-

Whorter and Leland Clemens.

The Ruggers will play a strong

Lewises Give W&L $9 Million,
Largest Gift In School’s History

Sum To Endow
Legal Center

Yesterday Mr. and Mrs, Sydney
Lewis, of Richmond, gave $9 mil-
lion to Washington and Lee Uni-
versity. The gift is the largest in
the 200 year history of the institu-
tion.

The gift will help make possible
construction of a $7 million law
building, which will bear the name
Lewis Hall. It will also establish the
initial endowment for a law center,
to be named the Frances Lewis Law
Center in honor of Mrs. Lewis.

Robert E. R. Huntley, president
of the university, announced the gift
and disclosed detailed plans for the
new building and law center in
Richmond,

Mr. Lewis is an alumnus of both
Washington and Lee's undergradu-
ate and law schools and is a trustee

of the university. He is founder and .

president of Best Products Inc.,
the Richmond-based catalogue mer-
chandising firm.

Joining in the announcement were
Dr. John Newton Thomas of Rich-
mond, rector of the board of trus-
tees; John M, Stemmons of Dallas,
Tex., president of Industrial Prop-
erties Corp., and Roy L. Stein-
heimer Jr., dean of the School of
Law.

Mr. Stemmons is chairman of the
“Achievement Council,” the organi-
zation created by university trustees
to direct a comprehensive develop-
ment program, announced last
month, which secks to raise $36
million by 1976.

Mr. and Mrs. Lewis’ gift brings
to $18,528,469 the amount com-
mitted to date toward the $36 mil-
lion goal, Of the current total, $11.5
million represents contributions
from all 19 members of Washing-
ton and Lee’s board of trustees.

The Frances Lewis Law Center,
Dean Steinheimer said, will permit
Washington and Lee law students
and faculty to undertake “pioneer-
ing investigation and analysis” of
matters regarding current and future
development of law and legal pro-
cesses.

Both theoretical and practical, of
“clinical,” approaches will be en-
couraged in the Law Center, he
added.

Construction of the new law
building is expected to begin before
the end of the year, President Hunt-
ley revealed. Architectual plans and
specifications have been in prepara-
tion for more than two years, he
said, and the university anticipates
that they will be ready to be sub
mitted for bids by the end of the
surmmner.

Mr. Huntley said the new facility
is expeoted to be ready for occu-
pancy by September, 1975

The building will contain 117,219
square feet of space-——more than
six times the 18,813 square feet in

the existing law building, Tucker
Hall. Tucker was constructed in
1935 to accommodate a law stu

dent body of 76

At present, law enrollment is 252
The new building is designed to ac
commodate 350 students, the en
roliment figure the university has
determined to be most desirable for
a quality law program of the
character of Washington and Lee's

vide essential study area.

The School of Law was founded
independently in 1849 and incorpo-
rated by Robert E. Lee, then presi-
dent of Washington College, as a
division of the institution in 1866,

The School of Law numbers five
former presidents of the American
Bar Association among its alumni—
including Mr. Malone (1958-59) and
Supreme Court Justice Lewis F.
Powell Jr. (1964-65), both Wash-
ington and Lee trustees. Only two
other law schools, those at Colum-
bia and Harvard Universities, have
seen more alumni elected to head
the A.B.A.

More than 100 graduates of the
School of Law are currently judges
at every level throughout the na-
tion. Three of the 25 largest cor-
porations in the nation have Wash-
ington and Lee law alumni as
general counsel or executive ad-
ministrators of the legal staff: Gen-
eral Motors, U.S. Steel, and Union
Carbide.

The new Frances Lewis Law Cen-
ter at Washington and Lee will
make possible a “comprehensive, in-
depth program of studies—in class
and out—relating to the awesome
problems which face the law in
American society,” according to
Roy Steinheimer, the university law
dean.

“lt will permit the development
of effective research methods on
the problems themselves, and pos-
sible solutions to them,” he said.

An important function of the Law
Center, he said, will be designing
proposals for changes in existing

laws and in the administration of
justice.
The Law Center will provide

leaves for law teachers to conduct
extensive investigation into problems
on ‘the frontiers of the law, he said.
In addition, the center will sponsor
seminars, symposia and institutes in
which experts from across the na-
tion, both lawyers and laymen alike,
will participate with Washington
and Lee law faculty and students.

Another important function of
the Frances Lewis Law Center will
be publication of the results of pro-
jects, Steimnheimer said, both in the
traditional manner, in books and
periodicals, and in innovative new
ways—by electronic videotape, for
example.

The principal intellectual asset of
the Lew Center will be the uni-
versity’s own law faculty, the dean
said, together with its student body,
library, and other resources.

A particularly distinctive feature
of the Frances Lewis Law Center
will be its association with a law
program that awards only the first
professional degree in law. Wash-
ifgton and Lee has no other gradu-
ate programs and plans to add none

The undergraduate faculty at
Washington and Lee will add still
another crucially valuable dimension
to the center, he noted

,
im

Mr. and Mrs, Sydney L

ewis donated $9 million to Washington and Lee

     

University to support the development of the law school and an innovative

center for research in law.

A number of programs in opera-
tion at Washington and Lee for
several years will be incorporated
in the Law Center's scope of opera-
tion, Steinheimer said, including
legal aid and legal research activi-
ties.

When the new law facility is
completed, President Huntley said,
a major concern will be an ap
proximate doubling of the size of
the law faculty from its current
10. A director for Law Center
activities will also be added, he
said,

Mr. Lewis is a trustee of Wash
ington and Lee and of Virginia

of the boards of the Meditertanean
Society and Jewish Family Services
Mr. Lewis has served as president
and campaign chairman of the Rich-
mond Jewish Community Council,
president of the Southern Region
Council of Jewish Federations, and
board member of Temple Beth

EC Run-off Required

‘Contact’

Monday’s balloting for EC repre-
sentatives and class officers has re-
turned Archer Frierson and Rick
Gray to posts on the EC for the
Class of 1973. In the three way race
for sénior class president, Gary
Poliakoff and Lee Thalheimer were
the top vote getters and will face
each other in a runoff tomorrow.
The entire vote for vice presidents
of the arts, commerce, and science
schools was thrown out becatise
most students had voted for more
than one candidate.

The race for the two junior posts
on next year’s EC will be settled in a
runoff tomorrow. In that balloting,
Mike Brittin, Beau Dudley, Steve
Green, and Robert Johnson were
the top four votegetters. Berry Long
easily won the office of class presi-
dent over a small write-in vote, as
did Neil Lutins in the race for class
vice president,

Bob Keatley walked away with
one of the sophomore seats on the
EC. However, Murray Holland and
James Overton will be on the run
off ballot tomorrow for the remain-
ing spot. In the contest for
president, Bill Biesel and Chip Mar-
tin will compete in the runoff. John
Ratzel was elected vice president.

The run off polls will be located
in the freshman quad, the Co-op
and Washington Hall.

with a request by the University

in the Center was hailed as a great

Senator Gravel, a _ native of
Springfield, Massachusetts, has serv-
ed as Speaker of the Alaska House
of Representatives. He was elected
as only the third senator in the
state’s nine-year history in 1968.
After defeating incumbent Senator
Ernest Gruening in the Democratic
primary, he succeeded in winning
the Semate seat in a three-way race.

According to Mock Convention
officials, Senator Gravel will make
some general remarks orientated
toawrds the issues drawn up in the
platform of the Mock Convention,
To do this, he will have a copy of
the proposed party platform before
he travels here to make his speech.

After the keynote speech by
Georgia governor Jimmy Carter on
Friday afternoon, May 5, the party
platform, as drawn up by the plat-
form committee, will be presented
to all the delegations for a vote, At
this time, the delegations will be
allowed to modify the platform.

The platform will be designed to
represent the views of the issues as
seen by WAL students and young
people in general. A Mock Con
vention spokesman pointed out that
this will be different from the con-
vention itself, where the students
will try to reflect the opinion of the
nation in the nomination of a candi
date

Afier the acceptance of the plat
form by the delegations, Senator
Ciravel will make his remarks, At

son College, and was a Rhodes
Scholar, He served in the State De-

pantment from 1946 until 1951,
when he joined the Rockefeller
Foundation,

Omicron Delta Kappa now has

chapters at more than 100 colleges
and universities throughout the ma-

|OUTLOOKand REVIEW

March 22, 1972

On $9 Million Gift.

ty this time, everyone involved with Washington and
Lee has learned about the $9 million Sydney Lewis gift to the
University. Certainly, the donation was most generous and
everyone here, the students, faculty, administrators and other
members of the W&L community, is most grateful. Yet one
thing concerning the gift has beem largely overlooked ; that is
Mr. Lewis’ attitude concerning his support of W&L. The
Richmond trustee stated that he’ gaye what he felt able to
sacrifice to his alma mater.»He believed everyone should
share that conviction. That is food for thought for all the
soom to be alumni.

On Election Posters .

A recent comment on campussweat something like this:
“Is that a building behind all those posters?” The unfortunate
ansaver is yes, yes, yes!

There are over 4000, count ‘em, 4000, election posters plas-
tered acress W&L. The University-.Journalism Press has
printed an averageof 200 posters for each of 28 politico pat-
rons during this 1972°clection season. The result is posters
everywhere. Posters adorn trees, statues, sidewalks, stairs,
chairs; benehes, doors, floors, columns, fences, windows, and
walls,

No candidate has yet been able to give a legitimate ra-
tionale for this sophisticated mannerof littering. Usually one
candidate gets out his masking tape and goes to work merely
because his opponent or oppowents have already splattered
their names on every conceivable surface. This is understand-
able as a form of genuine competition, but the remnants mar
“the hill” long after the competition and polling are past.

Perhaps, as a sad commentary on the electorate (or at
least the candidates’ estimation of the voters), the red, blue,
orange, yellow, and pink placards haves NOTHING to say.
The posters only reproduce the candidates’ names in large
hold face type; naught is mentioned abeut qualifications, pro-
grams or issues at all. Election posters: fundamentally are
the equivalent of wedding or graduatiow notices ; they inform
the unknowing populace that “Hey, looka here, I'm running!”
So what?. Judging from these phenomena surrounding the
9 x 12 sheets of paper, what good-are-the things at all.

This is what the Student Executive Committee wondered.
The EC attempted to curtail the unsightly eye pollution by
establishing a ceiling for candidate spending: An existing
limit of $25 has not solved the eye sore-of blossoming posters.
According to a University Journalism Press employee, $25
will buy about 1000 posters. That is not much of a limitation,
Therefore the monetary. ceiling is not the key.

A more sensible approach would be to ban posters, The
LC could casityaccemplish the task, althoughthe group would
certainly be weeusing itself of wrongdoing, after the fact, if it
banned posters. Remember, all the EC members were cand-
idates at one stime, gusta few months ago. But at least be
thankfel for one blessing—the Interfraternity Couneil abo-
lished posters during its March elections. Consider how much
more hideous the campus would have appeared-with another

1000 posters.

On Recent Championship

A championship. was deld in Doremus Gymnasium not
long ago. That championship was not the NCAA College
Swimming and Diving Championships. Rather in this cham-
pionship the Jayeces erushed Pres Brown's 37-30. The league
was Lexington’s Little League basketball. organization,

The championship, and andoubtedly the whole season,
went almost without avtice by W&L students. The young.
sters fought it out early every Saturday morning in Doremus
while the college folks were customarily recovering from
hang-overs or five days of 8 o'clockclasses, It was a nice thing
for the sehool to do for the comnmnity, and it becomes even
nicer when you consider it was done without any thought of

recognition,

W@L: Where It Has Been, Where It Is Going...

Community. Involvement Examined

Ken Lane is Director of the Uni-
versity Center. He is a W&L alum-
nus, who served as Editor-in-chief
of the Ring-tum Phi.

BY KEN LANE

A feature of Washington and
Lee that is broad, complex, and

often ignored is the relationship be-
tween the University and the region
—Lexington and Rookbridge Goun-
ty—whieh surrounds it.

The subject is vast because there
are so many levels, some more sub-
tle than others, at which that re-
lationship exists. It is an easily
ignored subject because many, edu-
cators and students alike, view a
university as a_ self-contained and
independent entity, with its aims
and functions remaining internal
and unrelated to the environment
around it.

Traditionally, a university is sep-
arated from the rest of society by a
wall (which, for example, explains
the derivation of words like “intra-
mural” meaning “within the wall,”
i.e. within the university). Yet, es-
pecially today, universities inevit-
ably influence their environment,
and affect the social structure, if
not the lifestyle, of the communi-
ties where they are located. This
would above all be true of a univer-
sity such as ours which is situated
in a small town in a predominantly
rural setting.

That Washington and Lee has a
wall which divides town from gown
should not take much convincing,
even though that wall is not physi-
cal or always that visible. At the
same time, not all walls are inher-
ently evil and some are, in fact nec-
essary for survival. For example,
we are by definition a private, not a
public, institution, We are thereby
bound in certain ways in terms of
how we can apply our money and
resources; we are not an institution
for “public use.”

In other ways, however, walls
between the University and its sur-
rounding community, walls that are
not so necessary, are becoming less
distinet. Over half of the Univer-
sity’s 1600 students live in rooms,
aparuments,..or houses off- campus.
Of the total of 862 students living
off-campus, most (578) live in Lex-
ington; the rest (284) live in the
county.

Students are also an integral part
of the local economy. There is little
doubt that many businesses and res-
taurants would not exist without
students as customers. Moreover,
some students have joined the ranks
of merchants, Last fall, several stu-
dents began operating their own
filling station in town, Several weeks
ago, four students opened a new re-
tail store, the “Oz,” on Main Street.

The most significant area, how-
ever, where | see University “walls”
coming down lies in the newly
emerging trends of student volun-
teer service, This is the area which
| would like to examine in the re-
maining part of this article.

Maryland, was appointed the first

munity that his sudden and. unex-
pected death this ~past winter shook
the entire town for weekse*

Reach-Out

a year-round recrea- ..

Another illustration of a signifi- -

cant breakthrough in the area of
community service has been the for-
mation of Reach-Out, a community

- problem center for the ‘Lexington-

Rockbridge area, This project came
about as the result of a joint effort
of townspeople and students,

Reach-Out originated in October,
1970, when several students con-
cerned about the increase«in local
drug abuse met witha number of
community leaders to discuss the
need for drug education and a drug
crisis center. During the next-twelve
months, a planning group of stu-
dents and local residents met regu-
larly to move towards setting. up a
center that would help meet these
needs. The size of the group varied
between
with much turnover in membership,
but by the following summer (1971),
the center, called Reach-Out,. be-
came incorporated and things be-
gan to fall in place .

V.M.I. donated an old abandon-
ed house on Main St. which would
house the center. Washington and

Lee donated building supplies. Stu-»
alike ©

dents and local residents
chipped in to help renovate the
house and put in plumbing and
electrical wiring. Other residents
donated furnishings and money: Gas
heaters were installed, and by Oc-
tober of last fall, the house was
ready for use.

The requirement for all volun-
teers was that they undergo: an in-

tensive two-week training program ©

that included courses on commun-
ity and interpersonal problems, the
physiology and psychology of drug
and alcohol abuse, first aid, and
counseling techniques. Two train-
ing cycles were held early. in the
fall, and on November 1, 1971,
Reach-Out opened with two tele-
phones and a full staff of some
thirty trained volunteers.

From opening day, Reach-Out
has operated on a twenty-four hour
a day, seven days a week basis. Two
volunteers are on duty at any given
time, with the average weekly shift
for cach volunteer being six to eight
hours,

Though some days are busier than
others, the center has been active
in its first five months of operation.
Since part of the subsidy comes from
a Federal grant, the staff keeps ac-
curate statistics on the number of its
contacts, Le. the number of times
calls or visits are made te Reach-
Out by persons outside the staff.
(All information of a personal na-
ture is held confidential by the vol-
unteers). Over 2500 contacts have
been made to Reach-Out since it

ten and twenty persons,»

opened. Of these, 500 have been
considered to be “significant..con-
tacts”, that is, instances when a per-
son -visits or telephones  specific-
ally for the purpose of seeking help,

The majority of Reach-Out’s calls
for help have been related to pover-

ty, rather than to drug abuse. As a>»

result, the center has an extensive

list of community agencies to which =

they can refer people. Some ongoing
counseling may also take place be-
tween a family and the center's -vol-.
unteer staff, .

A signifieam - part--of Reach-Out
work -nevertheless has to do with
drug-related problemsy-The'type of
cases ranges froma caller seeking
general information ao someone
coming in who is suffering from a
serious overdose.

At present, of some _ forty-five
volunteers on the Reach-Out staff,
fifteen are Washington and Lee stu-
dents. Several others are wives of

_ students or of faculty members.

Legal: Aid

Another «significant..arca of stu-
dent voluntcereservice is the egal
Aid Association of the aaw School.
The organization is comprised of
seventy-five second «and third-year
law students, with a student -presi-
dent, John Wolf, andra faculty ad-
viser, Professor Lawrence ‘Gaughan
of the daw Sehook.

Authorized +y the Buena Vista-
Rockbridge Bar Assdciation, the vol-
unteers man-a Legal «Aid “Office in
the Court Howse~square in Lexing-
ton. The officeserves low-income
area residente-whoeannet afford a
lawyer. The standard is based on
$3000 or less annual income for a
family of four, even if the family is
not on welfare. Standards. are pro-
portionately lower or higher for
larger or smaller families.

The student volunteer sereens ap-
plicants for Legak,Aid> to determine
their eligibility, then assigns each
qualifying applicant to a lawyer,
There are a total of sixteen sareas
lawyers who voluntece theireservices
on a rotating» basis,

A law student in the Legal Aid
program is chosen to assist the law-
yer when aecase-assiganaentds made.
If atthesized by the lawyer he is
helping, the velumteer may do what-
ever a practioing- lawyer is entitled
to do in carrying out his case re-
search, For example,»he has access
to many files and other information
otherwise! considered ‘o¢onfidcatial.
However, the voluntcer may not ap-
pear in court as the client's kawyer.

Almost all of the eases handled
through Legal Aid are either seri-

ous misdemeanors or civil suits, such

as cases involving bill collection,
welfare, social security, and divorce,
The Legal Aid Assosiation was

stanted in 1966, but only in the last -

couple of years has it begun to ex-
pand significantly. For example, the
number of volunteers rose from
twenty last year to seventy-five dur-
ing the current year.

A new Legal Aid office opened
this past winter in Staunton, serving
residents of that city and .Augusta
County. The office is staffed by stu-
dents from the School of Law, as-
sisted by jonior and senior students
from Mary. Baldwin College.

This coming summer, a Legal
Aid office will open in Harrison-
burg, to be staffed by our law stu-
dents. According 10 Legal Aid ad-
visor, Professor Gaughan, a pro-
posal is being submitted to the local
bar 4 permit expansion of our
Legal .Aid services to cover the en-
tire five counties of the Sixth Fed-

®

eral Planning District; in which we
are located, Along with that expan-
sion, Gaughan added, he would like
to begin to recruit undergraduate
students to assist in the program.

University Federation

A third and final new area of
significamt student volunteer serv-
ice is the work of the student organi-
zation, the University ..Federation.
This is a community service group
currently. under the office of the
University Chaplain. Although the
organization is a descendent of the
University .Ohnistian «Association, it
is today a secular group, sponsor-
ing no feligious activities as such,
Its main function is to coordinate
and channel studeat) voluateers,.into
new -SeTVice.. projects... “-

The Federation-ourrently has five
operating: programs: the .Big Broth-
er-Big Sister program, the Tutoring
program,» the Children’s Winter
Clothing Drive; weekly student aid
visits to Western State, Mental, Hos-
pital in Stawaton; and: monthly stu-
dent. aid visits to Chatham Nursing
Home in Chatham, Virginia.

The’ Federation has a total volun-
teer force of some forty-five Wash-
ington and Lee students; Also, ten
volunteers from Southern Semin-
ary are working in both the Big-
Brother-Big Sister Program and the
Tutoring Program. A couple of vol-
unteers from Lexingten High.School
have joined. the Western State Pro-
gram.

By far the two. strongest pro-
grams, the Tutoring and Big Broth-
er projects, have. developed. within
the hast year. »

Starting bast fall, the Tutoring
program is the newest~ and most
popular of the programs. Last .se-
vester, the Federation placed sev-
enteen volunteers in Central Elc-
mentary Scheel.- Six were from
Waskington and. Lee; eleven from
Southern Seminary, This semester.
there are twenty-two volunteer tu-
tors at Central who are Washington

» and bee students.«Some tutors. are
on a, one-to-one basis; other tutors |

are given an entire section of a
class. The program requires a com-
mitment of at least one hour a
week from each volunteer.

”

The other major project, the Big. -

Brother-Big Sister Program, has ten
Washington and Lee students and
two Southern Seminary students.
Each volunteer is matched with a
child who is informally “adopted”
as a little “brother (or sister). The
local welfare and probation depat-
mentseseleet the children who are
little brother candidates. Each de-
partment also matches the volun-
teer with the little brother, and each
big brother is given an adviser from
the referral agency who is person-
ally with the child, The volunteer is
assigned to visit with his little
brother at least three hours a week.

In The Future

In response to the rising new in-
terest in volunteer service, the Uni-
versity has plans next year for an
administrative office through which
students can be channeled into com-
munity service projects. The nucleus
for the new organization is this
year’s University Federation, | have
been appointed by the University as
Executive Director of the organiza-
tion along with my job as Univer-
sity Center Director. The Volunteer
Office will operate out of the Uni-
versity Center Office and several
students on the University’s work

EES: 28

BY W. PATRICK HINELY

Page 15 of the new catalog says
“the Washington and Lee campus is
renowned for its beauty and charm.”
Whoever wrote that didn't take into
account certain exceptions, such as
the time preceding student “gov-
ernment” elections.

It is ironic that students make
such strong accusations about credi-
bility gaps in the recruitment-orient-
cd catalog, saying that the book
covers up shortcomings of the Uni-
versity, In some oases, the students
are completely right. In most, there
are various shades of gray none of
us can really sort out, but in the
case of the election posters which
have blanketed our campus, we stu-
dents have the writers of the cata-
log to thank for not telling the story
like it really is. It would run some-
thing like this:

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Student government at W&L is
basically a shallow and disor-
ganized organization. But like
everything else at W&L, it is
unique. It has so much power
that it transforms the campus
several times every year, Be-
fore elections, which are in-
geniously timed and arranged to
keep the same cadre of people
in office, candidates for all its
superfluous offices change the
campus to resemble Wall Street
during a parade in which not
only ticker tape, but also larg-
er and more obnoxious pieces
of paper flap about in the
breezes which waft through
lovely Lexington, and cover
the beautiful, tree-shaded cam-
pus like snow, only more color-
fully and in a much more taw-
dry manner. What is indeed un-
fortunate about these student-
created phenomena is that un-
like snow, they don't melt.
They must be picked up (or
off) or else will continue to be
eyesores for weeks.

It isn’t enough that the posters
should be so prolific, not only on
buildings, which is the lesser crime,
for buildings are man-made, but
the sacred domain of nature has
been invaded. If trees could scream
for every staple or tack driven into
them for the inane purpose of hold-
ing up campaign posters, classes on
the hill would have to be cancelled.

&
Earmufls would be needed for pro-
tection from the noise, regardless of
the temperature.

I'm not saying every candidate
should hire an artist to design his
posters,

What I'm saying is that the stu-
dent “government” should at least
be responsible enough to control
such periodic thrashings of the cam-
pus, If our “leaders” can tear them-
selves away from such top-level de-
cisions as what kind of booze to
buy for the next cocktail party,
they might take enough time to ap-
propriate a comparatively small
sum of OUR money to purchase a
few bulletin boards, which could be
placed at prime advertising loca-
tions around campus, on which and
ONLY on which candidates for of-
fice would be allowed to display
their propoganda,

Or there is an alternative plan.
Pass a rule requiring all candidates
to have their campaign literature
printed on rolls of tissue paper,
which would be placed at their
obvious logical locations around
campus. This plan has the most
advantages, since it assures com-
plete saturation of the student
body, probably within 24 hours, It
is also a more effective means of
advertising, because surveys have
shown that people would much
rather get something free that they
can USE than something they can
only look at.

Of course, there is a third alter-
native, and one which is most likely
to be followed by our student “gov-
ernment.” That is to do nothing.

If that is the case, the administra-
tion could justifiably interefer in
student affairs and place _restric-
tions on ALL student originated pos-
ters. Sooner or later, this would in-
terfere with First Amendment rights
of free expression.

Then the question would be one
of free expression vs. controlled ex-
pression. If the student “govern-
ment” would make a move to regu-
late ITSELF—not to regulate the
students as a whole, but to control
THEMSELVES—then maybe stu-
dents and administration alike
would come to look at them as more
than a Mickey Mouse operation .

Talk to your “officers” about it.
At least you'll find out who they
are.

 

On The Referendun

BY MARC SMALL

The commotion from the coeduca-
tion referendum has died, and the
results have become a part of cam-
pus history. Many of us were shock-
ed: memories of the Freak Week
vote and of the straw vote on the
coed issue held three years ago ran
deep, and it became almost a cliche
to state emphatically #hat the results
were decided even before the vote
was taken. Yet, even the heavy turn-
out worked agaifst the reformers,
the fraternities poured forth in
considerable strength, and another
nail in the gallows on which the
University was to be hung has been
thankfully bent beyond use.

lt is obvious that the vote was
not overly importam, for the final
decision is in the hands of the
Trustees, a body that has in the
past displayed a streak of individual-
ism and a willingness to fight to pre-
serve the Washington and Lee they

ning of the organization.

A student director will work with
me, along with a core group of the
students who are chairmen of the
different projects, In addition to
continuing and reinforcing the pro-
jeots already in existence, the Volun-
icer Office will be working with
various community agencies in an
effort to develop new service pro-
jeols,

A strong recruiiment drive is
planned for next fall, Sign-up sheets
will be available to students when
they go through the registration line
The Volunteer Office will then place
volunteers according to their inter
ests and act as a liaison between
the volunteers and the cooperating
agencies, providing a structure for
on-going training and evaluation.

Hopefully, the three developments
discussed above, Reach-Out, Legal
Aid, and the University Federation
Office, are trends of further break-
throughs between the University and
the community, Both worlds, the
campus and the community, have

think should exist. Hf the vote had
gone the other way, it would not
have meant immediate action now
or in the near future—but it would
have meant one more argument in
the hands of those who have worked
tirelessly and dynamically to bring
females into the student body of
this University, As it turned out, the
unwillingness of the students them-
selves to sacrifice a beneficial facet
of student life, coupled with faculty
and administration opposition to the
change, may well keep Washington
and Lee in its present state for some
time.

lt is hard to deny that the admis-
sion of women as degree candidates
appears at this time to be inevit-
able, since the fadishness of the
concept will soon erode any sirong
academic opposition to the idea,

ibly vulnerable toward favoring

month. Unless the coeducation issue
should miracubously become defused
through some presently unseen ac-
tion from om high, then within a
decade this school will be unable to
resist the pressures of maintaining
our face with other schools, and
will fall prey to the subtle inanities
of “keeping up with the Joneses.”

Men of Washington and Lee, you
amazed me, The vote was close—
but for once the urge to be “in” ap-
pears to have been overcome by
common sense and the realization
that this school can only continue
to offer its particular benefits as long
as certain standards are maintained
Yot, the victory is in many respects
a hollow one, since H will have but
a temporary effect in stopping thove
who see the future of Washington
and Lee in becoming but, as one
student said, “another drop in a
large and exceedingly drab bucket.’
lt will be only through hard effort
and constant reminders to the fac-
why and administration of all-male
sentiment that we can continue to
provide here a place for those who
wish the unique privileges accrued
by attending a school with the cour
age to stand out from the crowd
and speak loudly with the voice of
individualism and conviction

 

 

Article Tells of Black Alumnus

The Washington Star, in its Week-
ender magazine of February 19,
1972, printed an article about John
Chavis, a nineteenth century Negro
educator and Presbyterian minister.
The article by George Reasons and
Sam Patrick relates that Chavis was
born free in 1763 in North Caro-
line, served as a soldier in the
American Revolution, and later be-
came a minister and teacher in
Orange County, North Carolina.

The most interesting thing about
Chavis, however, is that part of his
education was obtained at Wash-
ington Academy, now Washington
and Lee University. The Reasons

and Patrick article gives no dates
for his attendance here, but Dr.
Ollinger Crenshaw, in his book,
General Lee’s College, mentions
Chavis as having been here in 1795,
and the Washington and Lee Alum-
ni Directory lists Chavis as having
attended for eleven years, from
1789 until 1800.

It is not certain whether or not
Chavis was the only Negro to at-
tend Washington and Lee before
the twentieth century (some evidence
indicates he was not), but, never-
theless, the Chavis story brings to
light one aspect of W&L history un-
known to most people connected
with the University.

THE RING-TUM PHI

  

BY LEX McMILLAN

I ran into a friend at the bakery
last Saturday and after I had helped
him pick up his sweet rolls from the
floor | began to consider his situa-
tion. He graduated last year and
after a brief absence returned to
Lexington for what appeared to be
an extended stay. He is only one of
many who apparently has experienc-
ed what I would call the “revolu-
tion of falling expectations.” It is
what Charles Reich would call a
manifestation of Consciousness III;
the beginning of the greening of
America.

It is a widely observed pheno-
menon and a very curious one. One
of the major ‘interest’ magazines
recently had a cover story on Ivy
League grads who were doing man-
val labor, blue-collar work, etc.

What is causing this “revolution
of falling expectations” and what
kind of results is it going to have?

One widely supported explanation
is a search for ‘meaningful’ work
(I think ‘meaningful’ has replaced
‘relevant’ in the terminology of the
beautiful people; far out. . . etc.).
It is this idea that really interests
me. Though the terminology reeks
of rhetoric it still appears that many
seek ‘meaningful’ work in a very
sincere way. Undoubtedly there are
other explanations for the “revolu-
tion of falling expectations,” some
noble, some not so noble, For in-
stance, two such polar examples
might be first, a rejection of the ma-
terialistic rapaciousness which has
characterized this country in the
past and secondly, emotional imma-
turity characterized by a fear of as-
suming the responsibilities of an
upper-middle class adult. It is signi-
ficant that this ‘revolution’ is more
commonly observed in the ranks of
the the affluent than among the
sons of blue-collar workers. They've
seen their fathers doing ‘meaning-

“Letting Go”

ful’ work for years and they view
a willful plunge in this direction
with some degree of disbelief. That
‘9-5 grind’ probably sounds pretty
good in contrast to a 7-4 job fol-
lowed by a 5-11 p.m. moonlight
job necessary to keep body and soul
together,

A rude shock may be encounter-
ed by these scekers of meaningful-
ness after they have so immersed
themselves in the blue-collar world
that they cannot escape. Of course
it is entirely possible that an indi-
vidual with a prep school, Ivy Lea-
gue, 125 plus 1.Q. background will
be happy house-painting, doing car-
pentry or working on automobile
engines. It is possible, but not prob-
able.

Reich and many of the ones who
have a so-called ‘green conscious-
ness’ would have us believe that the
rejection of materialism and search
for ‘meaningful work’ is an all-per-
vasive phenomenon cutting across
class lines, I think they are wrong.
However, it is a rather pervasive
characteristic of the affluent young
and it is because of this that there
will very likely be a trade-off which
will have a profound effect on our
society. The upper-middle class
seekers for meaningfulness will
move down and the sons of blue-
collar workers who already know
what meaningfulness means will
move up. Neat, yes?

Actually I think that the greening
of America will not have this sort
of effect. At best, the enlightened
young upper-middle class will move
into the same allegedly meaningless
jobs but with a less materialistic
viewpoint. Remember. this is at
best; at worst, Consciousness Ill
was a figment of Charlie Reich's
imagination.

All I can say is that, when these
seckers of ‘meaningfulness’ have re-

Letters To The Editor...

Privacy Invaded

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

The recent removal of parietals
seems to have worked satisfactorily.
WAL gentlemen are now given the
convenience of attending to the
comforts of their guests overnight.

Recently, however, parictals have
backfired on me. It seems that the
sanctity of my room in the old
freshman dorm, often referred to as
the zoo, has been broken. I have in
recent nights awakened to a steady
crunching sound emitted from the
walls of my room.

Realizing that restrictions concern-
ing overnight visitation by human
life have been done away with, |
wish that the proper University of-
ficials would institute some form of
reguhations concerning the presence
of other life forms . . . mainly in-
sects.

Help! My room has been invaded
by termites!
David Canto ‘75

Actions Criticized

lo the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

At a recent intramural basketball
game | was amazed by the actions
of some of our black students who
we played . Perhaps “amaz-
ed” is not the proper word. In fac
the attitudes of these “ es” is
that attitude which we white stu-
dents have come to expect. When
they have to. use a basketball game
io create issues for their plastic
radicalism, just to keep up with the
“cause,” and manufacture problems
that some of their “brothers” are
really experiencing, then perhaps
segregation is the only real solution
acceptable to them (aside from black
supremacy), Equality in its true
sense will never be reached when
the slightest conversation is con-
strued as an act of white aggression,
and then in complete “innocence”
the black “victim” hides behind his
three hundred years of slavery,

Since one cannot talk to these
individuals as equals then perhaps
members of this small sampling (
trust Ht is a small sampling) will
consent to respond with a letter to
the editor, Perhaps my impressions
are wrong, but they are recurring

Chris I Lundgren 74

Plea For Troubadours

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

After considerable time, | have
come to realize the full worth of
the effort, time, and mindy spent
on Alumni Association Busywortk
| have just received the latest bul
letin—a copy of the press release
eoncerning ‘President Huntley's
Founder's Day AQnnouttceemem. The
three singlespaced pages explain
im detail the University’s plans to

collect $36 million by 1976. The
various purposes for which the
money will be raised include the
gymnasium, renovation of MeCor-
mick, Tucker, and Newcomb Halls,
construction of ample student hous-
ing units, expansion of athletic faci-
lities, a program of general campus
improvement, and “restoration and
preservation of several pre-Civil War
homes and academic buildings on
Washington and Lee's historical
front campus.”

My concern is this: no mention
of any addition, renovation, preser-
vation of the Troubadour Theatre
was made. The number of students
served, the artistic involvement pro-
vided, the community enjoyment
delivered — all by the Theatre—are
sufficient, significant reasons for
such concern. The Commerce and
Law Schools, the Library, and the
gymnasium are of undoubted impor-
tance. lt seems valid to say that the
dramatic curriculum and its physical
vant are of equal importance to
those involved, Needless to say, i!
would be absurd to spend identical
amounts of money on the Theatre
and the Library. Proportional
amounts do seem rational.

Rufus T. Wright, ‘71

Changes Suggested

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

ht often requires a somewhat re-
moved view of a situation for a per-
son to openly express the feelings
of those in that situation, Jon
Swann’s letter in the past weck’s
Ring-tum Phi describing the dis-
courteous ejection of two black
children from Doremus Gymnasium
(while obviously her guests) appalled
many, but surprised few, for this is
the same type of treatment that most
students receive from Coach Miller
A simple change in one's schedule
causés this man to react with un-
qualified rage, To schedule the P.E.
course one desires for a later somes
ter may be beyond his understand
ing. To look unlike a WAL student
while using Doremus facilities may
bring attempted ejection in a man-
ner which is rude, at best, We think
that this indicates the gross inability
of Dick Miller to act appropriately
in situations dealing with WAL stu
dents, Were he in any other posi
tion, Professor Miller's inadequacies
might be easily overlooked, How
ever, as assistant athletic direotor
we find that he is constantly placed
in the position of reflecting what
one would wrongly believe to be
the collective attitude of Washing:
ton and Lee.

We suggest that a change in Couch
Miller's responsibilities is in order,
unless his manner should suddenly
become unusually subdued. at least
for him. This is not merely an om
nion of a few students, The gym be
longs to the students, not one man

Doremus Liberation Front

BY ROB: “Lash’}, LaRue

Athletics, particularly . those , at
Washington and Lee, rarely get mix-
ed up in campus , politics; Indeed,
even at a national level, the «spon-
sors of sport have until recently
avoided smoke filled rooms of the
sort which.gharagterize Washington.
In the past, few years, though, Con-
gress, the dnternal Revenue Service,
and the Supreme, Gourt are. just a

few of the wheeler-dealers who have,,

shown a new, interesin athletics.
Just look at, the Gurt Flood case, the
AFL-NFL merger, the withdrawal
of the Senators from D.C,, and the
rumored consolidation of the two
pro basketball leagues,

Following the trendy W&L | stu-
dents are now experiencing an awak-
ening of interest. in. the school sports
program, The freshest example. of
this is the organization entitled.the

E. Michigan Takes
NCAA College Team

Title In Swimming

Eastern Michigan University came
on strong on the last day to win the
NCAA College Division National
Swimming Championship last week-
end, It was the first NCAA swim-
ming meet Eastern Michigan has
ever entered,

The Hurons just joined the NCAA
this year, and next year hope to ad-
vance to University Division status.

Eastern Michigan trailed in fourth
plage after Thursday's events and
moved up to second after Friday's
activities. The leader both days was
the University of California at Ir-
vine, which had won the event the
last three years in a row,

Then on Saturday Bastern Michi-
gan scored big in all events, parti-
cularly in diving where they cap-
tured first, second and fifth places,
to run away from the rest of the
field. EMU ‘piled up 222 points. U.
Cal-Irvine and San Fernando Valley
tied for Second; each with 164
points. Other top finishers were
Springfield fourth with 150, South
Florida fifth with 143, Johns Hop-
kins sixth at 133, and Northern
Michigan seventh at 117.

Host -Washington and Lee had
qualified several individuals and a
relay team. for the national «meet,
but none made the finals and thus

W&L failed to score a point.

Individually, the outstanding
swimmers were U. Cal-Irvine’s Tom
Boughey and Johns Hopkins’ Bill
Milne, Boughey upset Milne in the
500-yard freestyle and also captured
two other firsts, the 400-yard indivi-
dual medley and the 1650-yard free-
style. Milne came back to take first
in the 200-yard and 100-yard but-
terfly events, Ricke Morehead of
South Florida won two events, the
200-yard individual medley and the
200-yard breaststroke.

Three new NCAA meet records
were set. Boughey shaved over four
seconds off the 400-yard individual
medley record with a 4:19.76 clock-
ing. Morehead’s time of 2:13.28 in
the 200-yard breaststroke was a new
record, as was Richard James’ time
of 1:59.60 in the 200-yard back-
stroke,

Boughey undoubtedly missed an-
other record when a mixup by an
official in the lap count caused him
to stop before he had completed the
1650-freestyle which involves 66
lengths of the pool, Boughey stop-
ped at the end of 64 lengths and
lost several seconds before realizing
he had two more laps to go. He still
swam the event in just 14% seconds
over the record,

The scrum consistently got the ball
out to the backs and the W&L line
took advantage of their opportuni-
ties and moved the ball well. Two
fine scoring runs were made by
\lan Corwith and Rob Hessler. AU
couldn't seem to muster much of-

scored on a long run just. before the
end. Cited for their outstanding
play were many of the WAL scrum-

team is now 2-2 for the season.

which is its lifeblood, we cam ef-

fectively prevent the Conspiracy
from achieving its goal, which we
call the Great Merger. So what we
want to do is get the United States
out of the UN, and to put all con-
ceivable, honorable pressure on the
federal government to get the UN
out of the United States.

Ring-tum Phi: Then, do you see the
President’s Ohina trip as patt of this
Conspiracy?

Melthaney: Yes, we do, and Mr.
Welch at the Council dinner was
asked this question and said, “We
see President Nixon's Ohina policy
and trip to China as an integral step
in the Conspiracy’s accomplishment
of establishing a world govenment
and we consider this as just possibly
the most disgraceful event or action
taken by a high level American offi-
cial, particularly a President, in the
history of the United States.” The
only thing we can think of to com-
pare with this was the determined
policy of General Eisenhower at the

of World War IL which was respon-
sible for the murder of between
two to five million anti-Communist
Eastern Europeans and Russians,
known as Operation Keel Haul—
but at that time Eisenhower was not
President, so Nixon’s betrayal of
Chiang Kai-Shek may be worse.
Ring-tum Phi: What was the sub-
stance of your talk earlier this
month before the Council dinner?
Mellhaney: Well, the emphasis at
the dinnet was the increasing acti-
vity of youth in the Society. |
opened the series of talks with a
brief presentation on the histori-
cal level, concerning the Conspiracy
which is approximately 260 years
old and has been working all that
time to destroy all traditional gov-
ermental systems, all religious and
moral codés and institutions and
out of the chaos, produce a one-
world dictatorship. I also spoke of
the present conflict in Ireland, and
also of some of the interesting foot-
prints of the Conspiracy which I
saw on my trip to the Soviet Union
in the suamer of 1969,

Over 100 years ago Negroes were
set free but without their share of
the country’s wealth they helped to
build. They had nothing to start off
with except their sweat and blood.
For the past century economic,
legal. cultural, educational and color
barriers have been placed in front
of them. Even an enlightened law
school such as Washington and Lee,
which turns out some of the most
outstanding lawyers in the country.
stood by in the 30's and allowed
a school system to be set up in Lex-
ington where there was a_ high
school for white youngsters and
none for Negroes, although it was
a single tax district.

Albeit Virginia Military Institute
and Washington and Lee have open-
ed their doors to Negroes, the bar-
riers will not be broken down until
the Negro can move into the main-
stream of American society. The
white public will have to understand
the Negro: what he has _ been
through, what he has been denied
and what are his expectations. The
“rap sessions” are a good attempt
at making this breakthrough but
what is needed most is an education
of the general public. Although
these sessions were opened to the
public, they were not well attended.

Rusk Addresses ODK Meeting;
20 Students and Alumni Tapped

BY PAUL LANCASTER

A total of 20 Washington and Lee
alumni and students were “tapped”
into Omicron Delta Kappa, the na-
tional leadership fraternity founded
at W&L, in a ceremony held yester-
day in Lee Chapel. The ceremony
was highligted by a speech by for-
mer U.S. Secretary of State Dean
Rusk,

Glenn Azuma, president of the
Alpha chapter of the ODK, which
was founded here in 1914, qualified
those tapped as “men of a high
standard of efficiency ... the repre-
sentative men of college life
and (those) bringing together the
faculty and student body on mutual
interests and understanding.”

After the tapping, Rusk delivered
his speech upon the theme, “You
and those in school with you are
destined to make up a unique chap
ter in the history of the human race.”
He cited this statement as one being
repeated many past genera-
tions, but he also went on to qualify
the statement through a discussion
of five major questions, These ques
Rusk theoried, were the ones
which today’s youth

over

upon “must

reach a solution before the end of
ihe century,”

The Rhodes Scholar first turned
io the question of nuclear weapons.
There are now thousands of mega
ns of nuclear weapons lying
around in the hands of frail human
beings,” he stated. “We had our
chance to pick ourselves up after
World War II. We shall not have
a chance to pick ourselves up afte:
World War III,” Rusk grimly stat
ed, referring to the devastating
force of present nuclear stockpiles.

“How do you prevent World War

111?” he asked. “Armament con-
tinues the (arms) race is mov-
ing.” He noted that within only a
few years we will multiply three- or

four-fold our cache of deliverable
nuclear weapons in this “race that
is inherently mad.” He noted that
even at present stages, “Each (the
U.S. and the U.S.S.R.) can destroy
the other no matter who strikes
first

Rusk consequently noted that the
solution of a “durable peace” lies in
many elements, particularly the
“deepening and broadening of in
ternational law.” Rusk is a profes-
sor of international law at the Uni-
versity of Georgia.

problem. “The United States will
seek to find better answers than
were found before

Finally, Rusk hypothesized, the
country must seek to accomplish
“major realignments of goals in
economic fields.” He flatly stated

maintains “six of
seven percent” of the world’s popu-
lation while utilizing “almost 50
percent’ of the world’s resources.
He cited that “other nations are go-
ing to wake up one of these days”,
realizing the gross inequities in the
distribution of the world’s economy.

Before departing from his general

theme, Rusk warned, “Please don’t
think of nuclear war as a continua-
tion of war over the past 5000
years.” To avoid it, he stated, there

“organize a

He ventured forth

Black Focus

 

BY JOHNNY E. MORRISON

“The Identity defined by action
is present and past; it may also fore-
tell the future, but not necessarily
so.”” —Allen Wheels

This year’s Washington and Lee
University Democratic Mock Con-
vention has set out to forecast the
future. The question remains to be
answered. Who will be the lucky—
or perhaps unlucky—one to be
nominated to represent the Demo-
cratic Party in the 1972 Presiden-
tial election?

Many intricate problems are con-
fronted whenever one tries to kick-
off something of the Mock Conven-
tion’s nature. Everybody, from the
chairman of the Convention on
down to the state delegate repre-
senting his respective state, must
have a total commitment if the
Mock Convention is to be a success.

If one thinks that the Mock Con-
vention can be organized with sim-
plicity and apathy among the state
chairmen, then he is totally mis-
taken. The state chairman is con-
sidered one of the most important
offices. The selection of the chair-
man is done selectively because he
is the battery of the convention.

he first task of a state chairman
is to organize his delegates and to
try to show them the importance of
being a body of workers dedicated
to making their state the best or-
ganized representation. The state
chairman's delegation comes from
volunteers and as time progresses,
its number dwindles. This comes
about because of the hard work and
pressure which increases as the Con-
vention day approaches. A_ state
such as California with its seventy-
plus delegates functions in an or-
rainized manner, through various
committees which can keep every-
one busy.

There are many responsibilities
charged to each state delegation.
rhe major responsibility which each
bears is that of acquiring
money. Whenever the word money
is mentioned, people sometimes tend
to become uneasy. The state chair-
men are not immune to this feeling
of uneasiness because after all, they
are human too. The budget for eact
state includes expenses for station-

scale

ery and posters, telephone calls,
and accommodations for visiting
dignitaries, There is also the cost

of the various parties and entertain-
ment festivals which are carried on
by various states. The type of enter-
tainment and parties is left up to
the state chairman's discretion. Each
siate is responsible for displaying

The Mock Convention

a float representing their state. The
costs range from fifty to one hun-
dred dollars.

One of the problems that a state
chairman confronts is the knowl-
edge about his state’s actual conven-
tion. A state chairman usually re-
medies this by performing as much
research as possible. When this pro-
cess is in operation, the state chair-
man may confront political leaders
and panty chairmen of his state who
are reluctant to relinquish informa-
tion, The reasons for this action
vary, but the most prevalent one is
the lack of time the real political
leaders and state chairmen have.
Most of these men are professional
lawyers, businessmen, doctors, etc.-
and are always pressed for time.
This handicap is usually alleviated
by getting Virginia’s Democratic
State Chairman to contact the states
who did not respond originally.

To know the political mood of
the state is also of great importance
to the state chairman. It is his duty
to know how the state he represents
feels about certain issues and how
each candidate stands on these is-
sues. Most of this information is
gathered by talking to the political
leaders and state chairman of each
state. Another path is reading the
state’s major newspaper and trying
to deduce which “hot”
and which are “cool”.

Phe Mock Convention will not be
in the shadow of knowledge because
it is one event which is considered
of great importance to many of the
political aspirants of Democratic
National Convention. Most of this
is due to past publicity and the
Mock Convention's almost perfect
record,

The true mark of excellence when
discussing the Mock Convention is
its ability to represent the many
different sectors of the political soc-
iety. Here, at the Mock Convention,
we have 200 plus students trying to
fore-cast how millions and millions
of Americans will vote in Novem-
ber. Mike Campilongo, co-chairman
of Washington and Lee’s Mock Con-
vention, summed up the main goal
of the Convention as being “able to
be as diversified as possible to be a
true representation of a diverse soc-
iety.”

Although the students who make
up this Mock Convention are not as
American people,
their success in trying to exemplify
a diverse society will be seen by
whomever is nominated at Washing-
ton and Lee's Democratic Mock
Convention.

responsible leaders in various phases
of student life and weld them into
a unity to promote the best inter-
ests of the student body and of the
University. Some of the other foun-
ders were student instructors so in
some sense this represented a group
of rather serious minded students
who were earnest in their desire to
contribute anything they could to
the best interests of the University.
We already thought of ourselves as
being public spirited and willing to
serve the University in anyway we
could,

So the two of us talked over
things and when we had some gen-
eral agreement we went to see the
president of the University, Dr.
Henry Lewis Smith, and he seemed
to have liked the idea, We talked to
Dr. De La Warr B. Easter who was
chairman of the Romance Langu-

idea and gave us some advice and

lt should be made perfeetly clear
that no ex cathedra pronouncement
is being made with regard to the
good doctor's “right” to turn stu-

however, is not rights, but ethics.

wrong. While she was passing one
of our fraternity houses, some of
the mental midgets congregating on
the front lawn felt a need to assert
their masculinity and shouted ob-

of thing is not unique to the frater-
nities and I am not condemning
them alone. However, it appears that
when little boys get together in
groups it is conducive to such il
logical and crude behavior

Significance Of ODK Explained

ous phases of student life in those
days,

We had a public announcement of
the fact that Omicron Delta Kappa
had been organized. This was De-
cember 3rd or 4th, 1914. We
thought of it as primarily for the
Washington and Lee campus, but it
wasn't long until others became in-
terested. They established a circle
at Johns Hopkins University, then
the next one was at the University
of Pittsburgh,

Ring-tum Phi: Have you noticed
any basic changes in ODK since it
was founded?

Latture: Surprisingly enough | really
think it has continued essentially
as it was originally conceived, There
is a good deal of flexibility in the
organization from school to school,
from small schools to big schools.
So it is not a very rigid organiza-
tion. I think sometimes a school
which does not have Phi Beta Kap-
pa tends to use ODK as almost the
equivalent of what Phi Beta Kappa
represents in the schools which do
have that society,

In many schools it has a great

deal of prestige and is very active.
In some schools they are directing
recreational activities, fund raising
drives and things of that kind, which
has not been true here. The idea
on our campus has been for the
most part to discuss, more or less
behind the scenes, the nature of
problems on the campus and then
to encourage different groups, be-
ginning with the Executive Com-
mittee of the student body and other
organizations, to serve in these areas
as successfully as they can. So that
has been the way in which the pur-
pose has been carried out in differ-
ent schools. Here it has been rela-
tively modest in its achievements
and in its publicity. In many schools
it has a more conspicious public
image than on our campus.
Ring-tum Phi; Could you tell us
what ODK means to you person-
ally?
Latture: Of course, | have taken a
very deep personal interest in ODK
all along and | have had an excep-
tional opportunity to be associated
with Alpha circle from the begin-
ning and have witnessed nearly all
of the elections in the past. I was
away from the campus for 4 years
but otherwise I have attended all
of the election meetings and practic-
ally all of the meetings held for any
purpose in all that time. I am con-
fident that the central idea is a
sound one of bringing people to-
gether who have different interests
and different points of view to dis-
cuss and exchange ideas and to try
to work out differences of opinion
and promote some idea of policy
that is of significance for the Uni-
versity.

| might say that I have had the
view that where ODK is active and
effective a great many issues be-
tween faculty and administration
and students could be resolved with-
out too much adverse publicity or
conflict. The idea of course is to
have students, faculty members, and
members of the administration in a
situation where they can express
themselves freely and frankly and
come to a mutual understanding
under conditions that ought to be
constructive and helpful to all con-
cerned.

Now
ally, I

of course, for me
think | would say that the
most valuable experience that I
have had is to become better ac
quainted with the members of ODK
| have became better acquainted
with many boys through ODK and
within the past few days actually I
have written notes to 15 or 20 alum
m whom | remember as members
of ODK. | could of course wish that
ODK were more active than it is
One of the big problems with re
gard to ODK is that we elect most
of the members as seniors and they
are soon gone from the campus
Also, we have a relatively
number of seniors and they are not
a sufficient number to wield
of influence on the campus
There are so many other organi
vations. for example, the Executive
Commutiee and the Student Con
trol Committee, so ODK is largely
an hon organization somewhat
comparable to Phi Beta Kappa. It
is essentially a

Ring-tum Phi: Do you believe that
ODK has had a significant effect on
the W&L campus?

Latture: | think that in the earlier
days when the student body was
smaller it was able to wield a more
significant influence than at present.
As I have said the other organiza-
tions have taken over many of the
functions that might have been exer-
cised by ODK,

I might give as an illustration the
fact that we had a hazing problem
on the campus when ODK was or-
ganized. There was what we called
indiscriminate hazing. A few boys
would take some freshman or other
unpopular boy and give him a good
beating, and that was sometimes
seriously objectionable.

One of the first things that ODK
did was to try to solve that problem
by setting up what we called an As-
simmilation Committee which func-

tioned effectively until fairly re-
cently .Now the Student Affairs
Committee and Student Control

Committee have taken that over but
for many years the Assimmilation
Committee, which was made up of
responsible persons, gave offenders
a hearing and avoided the violence
or the hazing that had been prac-
ticed on the campus before.

We also sent students to speak to
high school groups and preparatory
school groups to possibly recruit
new students. Also I recall one in-
cident in which a group of students
was very much displeased with the
University physician and they were
getting ready to have a big spread
in the Ring-tum Phi attacking him.
ODK was able to talk to the leaders
of that group and persuade them to
appoint one person, who was a
member of ODK to go to the phy-
sician and tell him what the com-
plaints were. That happened and
the problem was solved; there was
no outburst, and nobody was hurt.
It accomplished a purpose in a quiet
but effective way. So I think ideally
that is what ought to be done.
Ring-tum Phi: What do you feel is
the role of ODK on today’s cam-
pus? Has it remained meaningful
and what is the future of the or-
ganization?

Latture: | have already intinvated
that its present role is that of recog-
nizing student leaders as far as that
is possible. To be chosen from the
student body is apparently still rec-
ognized here as an honor. It is what
we would call a prestigious organi-
zation. I think that's generally true.
I have heard it said on many a
campus that ODK would rank with
Phi Beta Kappa. It interests me that
even alumni who are invited back to
honorary membership will travel
halfway across the country to be
here to be tapped. And I think that
indicates that it does command
some respect off the campus as well
as on the campus.

There certainly is an opportunits
for leaders to get together and to
consider questions that are of im
portance to the campus and to try
collectively to do something abou!
it, As to what the future is, | know
that there are still applications be
ing made to the national organiza
tion for charters in other schools
Right now there are 3 other schools
petitioning, so it is still a

Stickmen Dispose of UMBC, 17-7

BY BILL BALLARD

After winning three — straight
games W&L coasted home with a
17-7. victory over University of
Maryland, Baltimore County, Sat-
urday afternoon,

The defense, Don  Eavenson,
Harry Rogers, Tom Smith, and
Jimmy Farrar, seemed almost invul-
nerable. While goalie, Skeeter Chad-
wick, shut out UMBC in the first
half, he had only four saves to his
credit. Coverage was very aggressive
and close; the defensemen and mid-
fielders were able to go after their
opponents because they were back-

ed up and were able to
when overcommitted.

The offense was equally impres-
sive. They scored five goals in each
of the first two periods, to have a
commanding 10-0 lead at half. Skip
Lichtfuss was high scorer for the
game with four goals and two as-
sists. Jim “Piggy” McCane followed
with two goals and two assists, Nine
other players contributed to the
game total of 16 goals.

Despite the tenacious defense, the
Generals allowed the highest goal
production of the season. Chuck
Robson made seven saves but could

recover

resounding victories over Roanoke,

to report on his committee’s recom-
mendations to the Committee on
Courses and Degrees concerning
physical education requirements.
rhe Committee had recommended
that: 1) the requirement be cut from
five to three terms; 2) that students
be permitted to fulfill the require-
ment any time during their stay at
Washington and Lee and not neces-
sarily just by their sophomore year;
and 3) that the courses be strictly
on a pass-fail basis.

Dean Watt reported on behalf of
the Committee on Courses and De-
grees that it had decided against
implementing any of the changes
proposed by the Curriculum Com-
mittee at this time. He did an-
nounce, however, that the Commit
tee voted that the grade of P will
be recorded on the transcript for
indiivdual physical education

courses except for the final com-
posite grade.
In the discussion over physical

education requirements, one major
difference of opinion emerged, Dear
Watt cited that the Committee on

Administration Positions

Schildt Joins Law Firm

William McC. Schildt, Associate
Dean of Students, is resigning his
Washington Hall post to assume law
practice in Baltimore. Schildt has
been a member of the Washington
and Lee administration since 1968.

He will be replaced on August |
by William A. Noell, who presently
Financial Aid Director.
Schildt will then join the firm of
Miles and Stockbridge, where he will
be involved with corporate law.

As Associate Dean of Students,
Schildt's duties have been diverse
and varying. He has served as a pol-
icy-maker as well as an interviewer
in Admissions, as co-ordinator of
Freshman year, and as head of the
Dormitory counselor personnel.
Dean Noell said that his responsibili-
ties will be essentially the same as
Schildt's

“| don't look forward to leaving
Washington and Lee.” Schildt told
he Ring-tum Phi. Bui [| have al-

ways had a continuing interest to
practice law—lI just wish I could do
both.”

He stated that what he will miss
most is the student related work. “I
worked almost exclusively in admis-
a year or so,” he said. “I
vas also able to teach on a limited
basis in the undergraduate school,
is well as in the law school.’

Schildt expressed the fear that
he will lose “the personal dimension”
f his when he becomes in
volved in corporate practice. “May

in the long run to respond to this
interest,

One promotion and two additions
to the staff of Washington and Lee

Mock Platform Ready

Nationwide student opinion will
form the core of the 1972 Mock

emocratic Convention Platform, to
be released tomorrow to various con-
vention officials.

The multi-faceted platform, to be
accepted during the convention by
Alaska Senator Mike Gravel for
presentation to the National Demo-
cratic Committee, will first be modi-
fied and voted upon by the state
delegations.

The Convention will be held May
5 and 6, with the platform being ac-
cepted at 7:30 the first evening.

As pointed out by a convention
official, excerpts from the platform
itself presenting its major points
would appear to be “the most radical
part of it (the platform).” He ex-
plained that the vocabulary of the
document will de-emphasize the ap-
parent boldness of the platform's
major ideas.

Major points of the platform in-
clude:

—possible abandonment of the
free enterprise system, substituted
by the nationalization of certain
corporations.

—the endorsement of busing until
such a time as various social and
economic inequities can be dealt
with,

—the legalization of all drugs
and the establishment of a nation-
wide system of methadone mainten-
ance centers for drug addicts.

—the legalization of all “victim-
less’ crimes, such as prostitution
and gambling.

—amnesty for all draft evaders
and armed forces deserters.

—the withdrawal of all military
government personnel and all busi-
ness investments from Southeast
Asia,

—retribution by the United States
through international monetary or-

Beaty, McMinn Chosen
‘Contact’ Program Heads

Jim Beaty and Mark McMinn will
head next year’s Contact speaking
symposium which is sponsored by
the Student Body and the Interfra-
ternity Council.

Beaty is a rising junior from
Memphis. He majors in pre-medicine
and philosophy. McMinn is a rising
senior from Columbia, Tennessee,
with an independent major in phil-
osophy and psychology. He has serv-
ed as Chairman of the Washington
and Lee Film Committee. Both
Beaty and McMinn were members of
the 1971-72 Contact Committee.

The Contact co-leadership was
chosen after consideration by a se-
lection committee which included
the rising president and vice presi-
dent of the Student Body, two Inter-
fraternity Council officers, and the
two previous Contact co-chairmen.
Student Body President-elect Bob
Brennan said that the final decision
was “very close” and was made only
after protracted discussions over a
two day period.

At present, the program for next
year possesses no single theme. As
McMinn explained, “It is difficult at
this early date to project anything of
a concrete nature, such as definite
speakers, dates, etc. What Jim and
I are concerned with at present is
the formulation of a basic direction
encompassing a diversity of interests
on this campus. At the same time.
it is our desire to give the program
as much depth as it can contain.”

“We will strive.” he continued,
“as far as our capabilities and limita-
tions permit, to touch every student
with at least one aspect of next
year’s program. Perhaps a main de-
parture from this year's program
will be our effort to broaden the
appeal into certain non-academic
areas.”

Contact was begun in the mid-
sixties by Washington and Lee's In-
terfraternity Council. Its themes
have included “The City.” “The

 

Professer of

Sorman PF. Lord,

Crisis in Education,” and, this year,
“Contact ‘72” which sought to spon-
sor a wide variety of speakers with
each guest dealing with a specific as-
pect of his expertise.

Since its inception, Contact has
sponsored the Washington and Lee
appearances of many prominent in-
dividuals, including Charles Percy,
Mark Hatfield, W. H. Auden, Ram-
sey Clark, and Tom Wolfe.

Page 2 THE RING-TUM PHI

 

   

|\OUTLOOK andREVIEW.

For over 70 years The Ring-tum Phi has existed at Wash-
ington and-Lee University. During that period the publication
has been transformed from a football spirit sheet to a weekly
student newspaper. The life of the Phi has been characterized
by periods of great success and eras of distinct disrepute.
Regardless of the Phi's standing, spring has been it’s annual
season of metamorphosis. Each year a fresh editor breathes
new life into The Ring-tum Phi. The transition is no different
this April. Skip Paukert has quite ably taken over the reins
of editorship and brought in a new and promising staff. Dur-
ing this period of incoming and outgoing editors, two methods
of analysis automatically come to mind, One can either recall
what the paper has done this year or one can conject about its
future. The former route seems a bit more apropos for an out-
going editor. Therefore, here is a summary, a scorecard if you
prefer, of what The Ring-tum Phi has done editorially this
year, and what it has failed to do.
ss September the Amendment XXVI_ (eighteen-year-old
vote) was cited on page two. Students were encouraged to
register and exercise their right of enfranchisement. The re-
sult—less than 20 students registered to vote locally.

Another editorial emphasized the problem of disappearing
personal property at W&L. The value of trust among W&L
men was reiterated. The results—an increase in pilfering,
locked doors in McCormack Library, identification cards in
Evans Dining Hall, hundreds of dollars of athletic equipment
unaccounted for, and obviously a decline in the Honor Code.

Parietals in university dormitories were opposed on mul-
tiple occasions. The result—abolition of parietals under the
auspecies of the University Council.

The Phi criticized the rush system calling for more over-
all organization and cooperation from fraternity houses. The
results—the Interfraternity Council has made few inroads into
improving rush and upperclassmen are currently leaving fra-
ternities at an alarming rate.

A November editorial lashed the University Council. The
student-faculty body was accused of failing in its purpose as
a forum of university opinion. The UC was criticized for ab-
senteeism, lack of discussion, shortage of planning, loss of
direction and benign acceptance of university policy. The re-
sults—later the council addressed itself to salient issues such
as coeducation, the Honor System, and independent exams.

W&L's enrollment has climbed by about 300 in seven
years. The wisdom of this population increase was seriously
questioned, Result-—it was decided to increase the School of
Law enrollment by 100 students.

When W&L finished the addition to Doremus, additional
building needs were outlined within a December editorial: a
library, dormitories, and a law school. The results—a $56 mil-
lion development plan far exceeding the imagination of most
students.

It was pointed out that the Cockpit was operating in the
red and needed to be remodeled or rearranged to turn a profit.
Result—no remodeling, no rearrangement.

The Ring-tum Phi suggested that W&L investigate a Pay
as You Earn scholarshi psystem similar to Yale's. Result-
no investigation seems to have been carried out, or even con-
sidered.

Coeducation at Washington and Lee was vehemently op-
posed in the March | edition. The results
resolution was strongly defeated 535-438.

A plea was presented for more parking space. Result-
two new lots were built

a pro-coeducation

at the foot of the abyss next to
Doremus Gymnasium,

An emotional editorial asked that W&L men be allowed
to swim naked in the old indoor pool, Result
crackdown for decency seems to have subsided,

Considering some of the problems W&L has experienced
with the College Athletic Conference, the Phi strongly sup-
ported the move by the Generals to join the Virginia College
Athletic Association. Some of the results

The overkill of election posters was lambasted. It was ree-
ommended that the posters be banned by the EC. Result

In seven of the above instances editorial stands in The
Ring-tum Phi have caused zero results, Five of the above edi-
torials were met with action although in some cases the paper
honestly had only a mild casual relationship with the action
\nd in a couple of cases, i.e. the parking problem and the
doldrums within the University Council, things have im
proved but not enough. Therefore, judging from Volume
LXXI, the power of the press appears to be less than devastat
ing. Mr. Paukert, hopefully you will generate more results

Performs

A special presentation for celloist
Pablo Casals highlighted the W&L
glee club’s recent concert tour of
Puerto Rico over spring vacation.

The special concert for the 95-
year-old master was arranged as a
result of one of the group’s five sche-
duled concerts. One of the island's
top composers, Hector Campos-Par-
si, heard the glee club’s presentation
of “Nigra sum”, a composition of
Casals’, at a concert at the Institute
of Puerto Ricon Oulture. Obviously
pleased by the performance, Cam-
pos-Parsi made arrangements for
the group to appear before Casals.

Pieces by Anton Dvorak, Orlando
di Lasso, Vincent Persichetti, Hans
Leo Hassler, and, on a more modern
note, Paul Simon, were sung by the
glee club for the noted celloist. Sim-
on’s “Sounds of Silence” and “Sear-
borough Fair” were the first of the
writer’s works overheard by Casals.

The 31-voice gless club is directed
by J. Tucker Cook, instructor in
music at Washington and Lee, The
arrangements for the tour of Pureto
Rico were due in large part to the
efforts of Glee Club president Paul
Weeks, a resident of the Island,

The Glee Club's performance of
Casal’s own works brought raves
from their host, who shook hands

Profiles of Three Major Democratic Contenders

The following biographical pro-
files of the three major candidates
for the Democratic Presidential
nomination were written by the can-
didates’ floor leaders at the upcom-
ing W&L Mock Convention. They
are: Ben Sherman for Humphrey,
John Hammond for McGovern, and
Mike Agee for Muskie.

—Ed.

Humphrey

Hubert Humphrey was born May
27, 1911, in Wallace, South Dakota.
In his youth Humphrey learned
the value of hard work as he work-
ed his way through the University of
Minnesota. He majored in political
science and graduated Magnum Cum
Laude and Phi Beta Kappa. He
then went on to get his master’s de-
gree from Louisiana State Univer-
sity.

In 1945, Humphrey was elected
Mayor of Minneapolis and led a
crackdown against organized crime
who had looked upon Minneapolis
as a haven against prosecution—iill
Humphrey came to office.

In human rights Humphrey was
the leader as he spearheaded a fight
for a strong Civil Rights plank at the
1948 Democratic Convention. He
carried that fight to the Senate floor
where he was its chief spokesman in
seeing that the 1964 Civil Rights Act
was passed.

Humphrey is a firm believer that
in the Youth of America lies our
greatest resources, He has worked
consistently on programs for their
benefit. Among them are federal
education loans, The Peace Corps,

Trustee Named
Navy Secretary

John W. Warner, a 1949 gradu-
we of Washington and Lee and a
member of the Board of Trustees,
was named by President Nixon last
April 7 to become the new Secre-
tary of the Navy. He succeeds John
Chafee, who resigned to run for the
U.S. Senate from Rhode Island,

Mr. Warner holds a B.S. in phy-
sics and engineering from WAL and
a law degree from the University of
Virginia, He was elected to the
Board of Trustees in 1968, when he
was a member of the Washington,
D.C. law firm ef Hogan & Hartson.

He was nominated by the Presi-
dent to the number two position in
the Department of the Navy in Janu-
ary 1969. The new Secretary had
worked with Nixon's Campaigns in
both 1960 and 1968,

Mr. Warner is the son of a dis
tinguished Washington and Lee
alumnus, the late Dr, John W. War
ner, who received the B.A. degree in
:1903 and practiced medicine in
Washington, D.C, Since 1961 a
memorial scholarship honoring Dr
Warner has assisied pre-medical stu
dents.

From 1955 until 1960, Mr. War-
ner was an assistant United States
attorney for the District of Colum-
bia, serving in the trial and appel
late divisions of the U.S, Atiorney’s
Office, and concluding with two
years service in the criminal divi
sion tfial staff for the U.S. District
Court

VISTA, The Youth Opportunity
Program, The Headstart Program,
and many others.

The quest for a durable peace has
been the keystone of Humphrey's
record, He was the sponsor for The
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the author
of the bill creating the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency
and the Peace Corps, and Food for
Peace programs.

McGovern

Senator George McGovern is a
native of South Dakota, born in
1922. He is the son of a Methodist

elected national president of Mu
Beta Psi, the national music frater-
nity, invited Casals to become an
honorary inductee into the W&L
chapter. The musician glowingly ac-
cepted the honor and promised to

McGovern is a graduate of Dako-
ta Wesleyan University and North-
western University in Chicago. He
holds a PhD degree in history. Prior
to his entrance into the Congress in
1962 he was a professor at Dakota
Wesleyan.

During World War Il, McGovern
served as a pilot in the Army Air
Corps and was awarded the Distin-
guished Flying Cross for bravery.

In 1960, he became a special con-
sultant to President Kennedy and
was the first director for the Food
for Peace Program. Following his

recent works in manuscript.

Other full-length concerts were
performed at Robinson High School
and Fort San Cristobal. The latter
was part of the United States Park
Service’s celebration of its 100th
anniversary. Also, who could for-
get singing around the Hotel Shera-
ton’s Pool with a 20 mile-an-hour
wind attempting to blow all the
music into the pool!

There was plenty of spare time to
relax, drink, gamble and run. Tours
were taken to Old San Juan where

P.R. rum), April 12 saw three V.W.
buses making tracks to the Rain-
forest and then on to Luquillo Beach

well banquet was held at a nearby
restaurant where an impromptu con-

day, the Glee Club was heard a top

Petters To The Sditer...

Grieg Loves Letters

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi

I am glad to see that the Phi is
finally becoming interesting reading
again. My reference is to the cur-
rent numerous debates raging in the
Letters to the Editor section. In my
four years at W&L I've seen the Phi
go from a bi-weekly four-page paper
to a weekly six-page paper to a
weekly six-page paper with no pages
3 or 4, But as | mentioned, outside
writers have come to the call, and
through their letters made the Phi
exciting.

In recent issues some healthy con-
troversy has arisen in the form of
1) students against Mr, Dick Miller;
2) Black students versus White stu-
dents; 3) students versus the univer-
sity “medical” services; 4) drunk,
hell-raising, obscene fraternity mem-
bers versus “sober, less than qualifi-
ed critics”; 5) an unhappy loser; and
6) a slur on poor Bert Meem. | ap-
plaud all who wrote either initiating
or concerning the above, for they
have made it worthwhile to trek to
the library to get a Phi.

1 would like to stir up some nests
and jump on this letter-writing band-
wagon. Where was page 3-4 in the
March 29th issue? Isn't that like
putting page number 15 at the top
of the last page of your eight page
statistics term paper? And further, I
think that Bert Meem is owed an
apology for being included in that
stupid letter in the 3-29 Phi.

Coach Miller Defended
To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

It appears it has become the cur
rent Voge on campus to attack
Coach Miller for the injustice and
bigotry he daily perpetuates from
within the confines of Doremus

purpose here is neither to attack

nor defend, per se. | consider the
following to be signifioant, of worth
and necessary, only because it re

tes to what bas already appeared
n print. In short, if some have felt
driven to publicize what Miller has
done to them, | others
should take with
what the man has done for them

Case No. 2: On any given Sunday
this winter, one might have noticed
activity within the old gym, that last
great old bastion of white supre-
macy. Inside, believe it or not, were
youths of both races (of the Lexing-
ton Recreation League), playing bas-
ketball side by side, enjoying the
Miller-sanctioned use of the gym for
their games.

Case No. 3: Today, April 3, Mil-
ler entered the new gym while a
white law student and | were playing
basketball with some blacks from
Lexington High School. He politely
asked those who weren't W&L stu-
dents, or sons of parents working on
campus to leave, upon request, he
allowed us to finish the game then
in progress.

| regret that | do not know Jon
Swann, and know nothing of the Jon
Swann Incident save what | have
read in the paper. Unfortunately, the
student who took it upon himself to
circulate the anti-Miller petition ad-
mitted, when asked, admitied that
he knew nothing more of the incident
than |. My only contention here is
that if one decides to publicly attack
another for an alleged injustice, he
should take the time to question the
parties involved, or at least, for
Christ's sake, one of them, I remind
those who blithely signed the peti
tion that they have publicly made
serious charges against an individual
who, unlike themselves, permanently
resides in the Lexington community
I hope they undertook such action in
good faith and in full knowledge of
the facts. To think of them doing
less is rather pitiful

A lot is heard these days about
the environment and people ask
“What can | do?” A great many
students on this campus clearly don't
care, for care of the environment in-

cludes preserving one’s immediate
surroundings,
Studenis might counter “But I

don't have the time.” Since students
often rush to some place only to
stop to talk to a friend for several
minutes, they clearly do have the
time. In fact. not walking on the
grass comes from a state of mind
One is in harmony with nature, One
might go so far as to enfold and
cherish the universe,

How can this damage be stopped?
I see only two ways: rules and fines
could be made very great—doubt-
less, this would not be dene; and al-
ternatively, students could come to
respect and this seems
doubtful, If the students would only
hange their ways and the ways of

W&L to Host Rugby see

N.C. Championship

This week the National Collegiate
Rugby Championships will begin at
8 a.m. on Saturday April 29 when
Washington and Lee takes on Prince-
ton University on the Upper Rugby
Field. Matches will be played thro-
ughout the day with quarter-finals
beginning at | p.m. and semi-finals
at 5 p.m.

The Championship game will be
held on Sunday at 2 p.m. on Wilson
Field. Wilson Field has been do-
nated by Washington and Lee Uni-
versity to the Rugby Club which is
sponsoring the Championships; but
there will be an admission charge of
$1 to defray the expenses incurred
in running the Championships,

The teams participating in the
two day competition are Prince-
ton, Harvard, Brown, Navy, Ten-
nessee, Kentucky, U.Va., South
Carolina, Georgia, LSU, Texas,
Michigan, Notre Dame and Palmer
College.

The Washington and Lee Rugby
team dropped a pair of games to in-
trastate rivals this weekend. The
ruggers were defeated 14-3 by Wil-

liam and Mary on Saturday and
24-4 by VMI on Sunday, The “B”
team also lost to VMI 18-0.

The William and Mary Contest
was delayed 2% hours by rain and
when finally played the field turned
quickly into a quagmire. The mud
worked to the Generals disadvantage
as speed merchants Rob Hessler and
Lat Purser were unable to break
away while the slower and heavier
William and Mary team was able to
wear away at the scrum, The W&L
team led 3-0 at the half but fell
apart for two minutes at the begin-
ning of the second half allowing 10
points by the Indians,

On Sunday, the party weekend and
previous day's injuries took their
toll as Washington and Lee never
really got untracked. The giant Key-
det machine rolled for its first score
with ten minutes gone in the first
half. Following this the Keydets con-
trolled the game throughout, Charlie
Gregory was an outstanding player
in this losing effort, scoring the only
try and contributing greatly to the
scrum effort.

mann’s performance but turned in a
good game making 12 saves,

Sunday's victory brought W&L’s
record to 8-1, the only loss being to
third-ranked Navy, Navy has beaten
Virginia and lost only to Maryland,
who has beaten everyone in sight.
The USILA ranking showed W&L
in the seventh position behind Tow-
son State, and UVa. in fourth. A
win over Towson and a good show-
ing against Virginia should assure
the Generals of a berth in the cham-
pionship tournament.

WA&L’s lacrosse team went 2 for 3
over during Spring break, beating
Massachusetts and Connecticut Wes-
leyan but losing to powerful Navy.

Goalie Skeeter Chadwick led The
Blue’s 9-5 win over Massachusetts,
chalking up 21 saves. John Lalley
paced the scoring with 3 goals. Sam
Englehart and Skip Lichtfuss each
scored 2, Ted Bauer and Brian Chas-
ney chipped in | apiece for the
Generals.

balls from the Middies, 62-59. Bauer
and Lichtfuss each scored twice and
Lalley, Englehart, Tognetti and
Neese scored once as the Blue was
held to its lowest point total of the
season

Sam Englehart scored seven goals
setting a school record, to lead W&l
to a 13-6 victory over Washington
College Sunday, The win moved the
Generals one step closer to a na-
tional championship tournament bid

Despite the seven goal difference,
the game was close until the last ing of the

the game by making 29 saves. WAl

erals rallied for four more runs, A
single by Don Hathway, a freshman,
was followed by a walk to Grayson
Fitzhugh and a double by Jim Nolan
which scored two runs. The inning
was capped by a two run homerun
by Bo Brookby. The final score was
9-5 with Grayson Fitzhugh picking
up the victory in relief of the starter
Rod Ferrendino. The next day in a
windy rain abbreviated seven inn-
ing ballgame, the Generals behind
the strong pitching of Captain Ellie
Gutshall, beat Oneonta 9-4, The
heavy hitting was provided by a two
sun-scoring double by Scott Breen, a
homerun and suicide squeeze bunt by
Dave Traylor, 4 RBI’s, and a triple
by Doug Clelan which scored three
runs. The game was finally called
after seven innings, and the final
score Was 9-4,

On Monday, April 10, the Gen-
erals opened their Florida schedule
optimistically against Florida Pres-
byterian. However, in this game and
in the three remaining games the
team did not play as they had four
days earlier on Smith Field in Lex-
ington, Putting aside the usual ex-
cuses of bad umpiring, excessive
heat, and bad hops, the team was
clearly plagued by a rash of fielding
miscues, Texas League singles, and
stranded base runners, In each game
the impossible continued to occur
and consequently the team lost to

Florida Presbyterian twice, 8-2, 5-2;
to St. Leo, 15-2; and to Tampa, 13-4.
Overall the Florida trip produced
a 0-4 record, a season's record of 3
wins and 6 defeats, and a dishearten-
ed team. Why disheartened? The
Florida teams were good ballclubs,
but not unbeatable. Had the team
played tighter defensive ball and
produced more than their meager
average of two runs a game, the
trip would have been much different.

Bright spots were few during the
trip, but there were two very notice-
able ones. One was the emergence
of Don Hathway as the team’s lead-
ing hitter and a fine defensive ball-
player. At the end of nine games,
Hathway was hitting at a .538 clip
and also had five RBI's. The second
bright spot was the fine pitching per-
formance turned in by Haller Jack-
son, Jackson worked eight innings
against Florida Presbyterian giving
up only two earned runs, Although
he lost the game by a 5-2 score,
Jackson exhibited a live fastball,
two good breaking curve balls, and
a vast amount of maturity and poise.
Overall, Jackson leads the pitchers
with a 1,59 ERA, Other team lead-
ers are Jim Nolan hitting at .387
and Dave Traylor with three home-
runs and eleven runs batted in,

Both games this past weekend
were cancelled due to rain. The
Generals face Hampden-Sydney
away this Friday but return home
Saturday to meet Richard Bland in
a doubleheader.

or standby for shipment to South
east Asia.” No sources of informa-
tion are given, the government has
said little, if anything, concerning
these movements, and | have been
unable to find any confirmation of
these charges. How can we be sure
NSA is telling the truth?

NSA siates that: “In January
there were 45 B-52’s in Southeast
Asia, today there are over 150.” At
the time the poster was printed,
there were 80 B-52’s in Guam and
Thailand, with 20 more on_ the
way over, 80 plus 20 equals 100,
not 150, Source: Time, April 17,
1972, pg. 37.

NSA that: “In January,
there are nine.” This is a lie. There
were 4 carriers there as of NSA’s
printing, with a Sth and 6th on the
way. Source: Time, April 17, 1972,
pg. 37.

NSA charges that: “The White
House has hinted that it was con-
sidering sending U.S. ground forces
into “rear areas” to. . . maintain
the troops of dictator Nguyen Van
Thieu.” NSA then calls Thieu “the
president of a corrupt and repres-
sive regime .. .” In fact, “The Presi-
dent directed that the 6,000 USS.
combat troops currently stationed in
Vietnam should not be shifted from
their defensive positions . . . to aid
ARVN’s fight against the North
Vietnamese.” (Time, April 17, 1972,
pg. 36.) The terms “dictator”, “cor-
rupt and repressive” could apply to
many governments, including that
of North Vietnam. Also, NSA for-
gets that Thieu received a 97°,
vote of confidence last year, with
the world watching, and his nation
under assault,

NSA concludes by stating that
“Richard Nixon has exposed his
concept of a ‘generation of peace’

Muskie

Of all the Democratic contenders,
Senator Muskie of Maine has had
the broadest top-level experience in
both legislative and exectitive
branches of government.

As Director of Price Stabilization
for Maine (1951-52) he successfully
administered the campaign against
inflation in that state. He won praise
from both businessmen and con-
sumers for his administration of the
controls,

As Governor of Maine for four
years (1955-59) he significantly up-
graded state schools, hospitals and
mental institutions, He also brought
about reforms in Maine’s prisons,
spured the state’s economy and in-
stituted programs to improve the
water quality in Maine’s rivers,

As a United States Senator for the
past 13 years, Muskie has built a

reputation as one of the most effec-
tive and respected members of that
body.

BY PAUL LANCASTER

The tradition and festivity of
American party politics arrives at

acceptance of the approved plat-
form by Alaska Senator Mike Gra-
vel on behalf of the national Demo-
cratic party.

The platform itself will reflect
nationwide student opinion on top
national issues, This is in contrast
with the balloting for the party's
Presidential nominee, which will at-
tempt to predict the outcome of the
National Democratic Convention to
be held in July.

The student delegates will recon-
vene at 9 a.m. Saturday morning to
begin the balloting to pick the De-
mocratic candidate for president,
At this time, the Chairman will ae-
cept names to be placed in nomi-
nation for the Democratic candi-
date. This year, potential nominees
must have at least 50 delegate votes
—with no more than 20 per state
counting as valid—to be officially
nominated,

The roll call of the state delega-
tions for the selection of a candi-
date will follow the nominations.
[he order of the roll call this year
will not be in alphabetical order, as
it has been in the past. Rather,
positions on the official role have
been determined by lot. At the
Mock Convention, Arkansas will
be the first state on the role, while
Colorado is the final delegation of
the list.

in honor of graduating seniors at
7 p.m., Wednesday, May 17, at
Evans Dining Hall. A reception
at the Alumni House will pre-
cede the banquet, commencing
at 5:30 p.m. All Academic and
Law seniors, as well as those
who will graduate in the fall and
winter of 1972 or in February
1973, are invited to attend.

The seniors who expect to gra-
duate in the fall and winter of
1972 or February 1973 are asked
to notify the Alumni Office if
they will attend the banquet.
Notification must be made prior
to May IS.

Mr. William Washburn, Exe-

Changing of the Guard

The changing of the Guard at the Ring-tum Phi comes but
once a year, and, first of all, it’s time to thank our veteran
staffers. They have endured, it seems, one long harried ex-
perience to get this paper out on time week after week. Editor
John Robinson deserves our special gratitude for his guidance
in the craft of Putting It All Together journalistically. As a
result, we have acquired all kinds of invaluabe and creative
techniques, not the least of which is learning to spell “Ring-
tum Phi” with the dash in the right place.

Secondly, this is the time to take stock of the publication—
where we have been and where we can go with it next year,
We are not deaf to the criticisms and complaints that have
come our way this year. There is no doubt that the Ring-tum
Phi should be improved, and there is no reason why these
pages cannot see considerable change—in style, content, and
format. Any publication must be vigilant to avoid stagnation ;
any newspaper has to remain topical and lively to preserve its
own readership.

Obviously, though, idle mutterings do not make construc-
tive criticism. If you have some imaginative ideas and willing-
ness to put them to the test in print, we urge (cajole, implore,
even beg) you to come see us in the Reid Hall office. The
ranks of the new staff will have several openings, among them,
reporters, editors, columnists, circulators, and reviewers.

There will also be a Spring organizational meeting for the
staff next week. Watch for posters announcing time and place.

Who’s Killing the Honor System?

Here we go again. We have just witnessed the third public
honor trial of the year, a phenomental record indeed. Before
last year there had been only four public honor proceedings
in the history of the university.

We do not intend to comment on the trial that has recently
concluded; the defendant was innocent of an honor offense,
as was decided by the jury. But there is no escaping the im-
pression that there is something terribly wrong with the state
of the Honor System at Washington and Lee, not as a result
of this or any other single occurrence or factor, but rather
as a result of a compendium of factors vital to the well-being
of any community of trust.

No doubt the Executive Committee has been partly culp-
able, and they would perhaps be the first to admit it. The
education of freshmen during Orientation Week last Sep-
tember seemingly failed to drive home the scope and jurisdic-
tion of the Honor System here. Plans are already in the works
to amplify this aspect of orientation for next year’s incoming
class; dormitory counselors will be given greater responsibil-
ity to emphasize the function and operation of the Honor
System,

But let's face it—-the increasing occurrence of honor trials
have not involved only freshmen. One most distressing fact
was brought before the EC by law student Rudd Smith, who
serves as a member of the university Athletic Committee.
Evidently, $775 worth of equipment (not $75 worth as was
mistakenly reported in these pages last week) has been stolen
from the new Doremus Gymnasium since its opening in mid-
January.

Secondly, the library has been plagued with missing books
all year. Many professors and students can attest to the fact
that books on the reserve shelf, needed for research and sup-
posedly available for everyone, have been removed illegally
for weeks until the shelves are nearly empty.

And as a result of these occurrences the use of identifica-
tion cards has been suggested once again, just when we
thought we had dispensed with the problem in the Dining
Hall. But can we blame those members of the university com-
munity who are suffering from this breakdown of trust to try
to find some solution for it? If the students don’t respond,
the response will be made for them,

Many have complained that a student can no longer be
convicted of an honor violation, because the absolute penalty
is outmoded; a student jury, it is reasoned, is reluctant to
dismiss a student from the university on the basis of a single
offense,

But whether or not this premise is valid (and it certainly
is questionable), it is unrealistic to look for a solution through
amendation of the Honor System itself. To change the ab-
solute penalty would require a change in the university char-
ter which stipulates it. And this would take a two-thirds vote
of the student body to effeet, a vote which anyone knows
could not be mustered in the foreseeable future.

No, we must look in another direction for a cure for our
ailing honor system, We must, first of all, recognize that
thieves do exist at Washington and Lee and must bring this
point to bear on the indifferent students among us.

There is reason to hope, With an improvement in fresh-
man orientation, our Honor Code may probably weather this
particular threat, but it will take the attention and aid of every
student to preserve the trust that we have known here,

Eyewitness Account

This letter was received by the
Mock Convention Office this week,
written by 84-year-old Wheatley M.
Johnson who helped to organize the
first Mock Convention at W&L
back in 1908, At that time Four-
time Presidential Candidate William
Jennings Bryan spoke in Lexington,
and here Mr. Johnson clears up a
few historical points about that oc-
casion. Mr. Johnson plans to visit
Lexington again this weekend for
the upcoming proceedings,

—Ed.

The account of the start of these
Conventions in “General Lee’s Col-
lege” is the only incorrect item that
I have seen in the excellent book,
when it states that William Jen-
nings Bryan made a speech in Lex-
ington in his campaign for the third
time for the Presidency.

While it is true that a speech by
Mr. Bryan started the idea, it was
not a political speech.

Mr. Bryan’s appearance in Lex-
ington that year, was of a type that
all of the candidates this year would
be glad to have an opportunity to
fill.

He came as a paid speaker as one
of a series of events in a Chautauqua
series. It is almost impossible for
the present generation to envision a
world without television, radio or
even speech amplifiers but in 1908
that was the case and in order to
properly educate the public, most
sections of the country had these
series of entertainments, usually a
musical one, an acting one, and a
speech by a good orator and tickets
were sold for the series (three, four
or more appearing about two or
three weeks apart). This was the
reason for the appearance of Mr.
Bryan in Lexington and his speech
was non-political, “The Price of
Peace”.

Of course he was not only paid
for the speech but also had an op-
portunity to campaign on the trip.

At any rate, a few days later, W.
Jett Lauck, assistant professor of
economics and politics conceived the
idea of a Mock Convention and
called together several of his stu-
dents and we took a list of the stu-
dent body and made up the state
delegations,

In that year Bryan was the lead-
ing candidate for the Presidency
and while there were no primaries,
his only opposition was Gov. John
A. Johnson of Minnesota, the choice
of the conservatives, and he died of

Costs Revealed

For Convention

The total cost of this year's Mock
Convention, according to Co-Chair-
man Mike Campilongo, will be ap-
proximately $12,500. The student
body has already contributed $3,800
towards that goal.

Each student contributed $3.00
which was taken up in the matri-
culation line in September,

Law student David Walsh, in
charge of finances for the Mock
Convention says that he is confident
that $12,500 goal will be reached.
“The deficit will be made up by
contributions from alumni and ad-
vertisements in the Mock Conven-
tion Journal. Contributions are con-
tinuing to flow into the Convention
office.”

According to Walsh, revenue from
Journal advertisements totals $1,500.

Principle expenses for the Mock
Convention include acquiring and
decorating facilities for the actual
convention ($2,500). The Mock
Convention is allowing $2,500 for
political research and $2,000 for
telephone expenses.

Credentials Committee Chairman
Fred Franke notes that these figures
represent over six months of work.
“The Mock Convention has been
working all year long. We brought
several speakers to Lexington in
hopes of helping state chairmen with
their research.”

Facilities Chairman Lou Hannah
has reserved five telephones exclu-
sively for the press covering the
Mock Convention. He also has
worked with the telephone company
in arranging a hook-up which will
allow the winning candidate to ad-
dress the convention via telephone.
There will also be telephones re-
served for State Chairman to make
last minute calls to political experts.

The Meck Convention Journal
was printed in the Journalism Lab-
oratory Press at a cost of $1,800.

Protocol Chairman Jeff Twardy
was budgeted $1,500 to cover the
expenses involved with transporting
and housing the Mock Convention's
principle speakers, U.S. Senator
Mike Gravel and Georgia Governor
Jimmy Carter

Other expenses incured by the
Mock Convention include the cost
of the parade, mailing of letters to
alumni, printing of the platform,
press relations, printing of posters,
imsurance, clean-up and stationery.

a heart attack several weeks before
the national convention.

The nominees of our convention
were Bryan and Senator Culberson
of Texas as Vice President. We had
a very nice letter from Culberson
when we notified him, but he stated
that he was not a candidate.

Some of the Virginia papers ap-
proved of the idea of the Mock
Convention and some had editorials
saying that we would have been bet-
ter off doing the studies in the Col-
lege Courses.

How we put over the Convention
with practically no funds and why
it has lasted | don’t know but | do
think it has helped to give the stu-
dent body of Washington and Lee a
better insight into the problems that
confront us and a better knowledge
of finding solutions for those prob-
lems.

History of The Mock Convention

A Backward Glance
BY PETE FUREY

As Wheatley M. Johnson ‘08
writes, William Jennings Bryan
visited Lexington in the spring of
his senior year, That speech spark-
ed a sudden and keen interest in na-
tional politics. Prof. W. Jett Lauck’s
spur-of-the-moment idea has regen-
erated itself 13 times. The Mock
Convention which convenes _ this
Friday will mark W & L’s fifteenth
convention.

The Mock Convention has proven
itself correct in ten of those at-
tempts. The last mistake came in
1948. Since then Lexington prognos-
tigators have enjoyed an unblemish-
ed two decades.

Newsweek wrote in 1960, “The
occasion was W&L’s twelfth conven-
tion, the most realistic of the dozens

‘Convention Mockery.’
A Dissenting Viewpoint

BY PAT HINELY

The leadership of the Mock Con-
vention seems to be avoiding one
of the basic questions they must
face in order to justify all the time
and money which has gone into the
extravaganza scheduled for this
weekend.

That is the question of deciding
between putting on a good, realistic
show or putting on a good, realistic,
show, along with some positive di-
rection coming out of the whole
thing.

American politics being as cor-
rupt as they are, it would seem that
such an “intelligent” group of young
people would want to do more with
an opportunity such as the Mock
Convention than play along with
old folks’ games.

Not so, it seems. Nearly all the
participants in this mock mockery I
have talked to discuss the whole
matter in the same way 10-year-old
boys act when they're playing such
intellectual games as “cowboys and
indians” or “cops and robbers.”

Some of the convention officials
have been a bit close-mouthed about
releasing very routine-type infor-
mation. The back rooms are already
filling with smoke, and it's not the
right kind of smoke. They say the
rest of us should just “play along
with the game.”

Well, the game is SICK. Those
people must have realized that by
now, That is why | was surprised
to learn that these supposedly in-
telligent persons are content, even
happy. to play along with it them-
selves.

If all the Mock Convention is
going to be is a replica of Conven-
tions in the past. it is a waste of
time as well as money, It would be
a Mockery in more ways than one,
A mockery of the U.S. Constitution,
and thus a mockery upon all of us
as Americans. This is the bad dream
we don't wake up from: men play-
ing games with our government, our
money, our lives. This is what we,
meaning our generation, have to
change. That begins with you, dele-
gales.

Wheeling and dealing in the
“usual” manner will undoubtedly
give you participants in this mock
mockery some kind of childish sat
isfaction for having power and for
having used it, Richard Nixon is
involved in these kinds of activities
daily, on a worldwide scale.

Face it though. youre losers in
a small world, If you get any more
satisfaction from playing hide-and-
go-seek with your votes than you de
from relieving a case of constipa-
tion, there's something wrong inside
your heads. Constipation of the

mind?

Our generation is the hope of
America, or so it seems. This nation
has great potential; it’s up to us to
see that the potential is realized. If
all we're going to do is play along
with the game as it is, we don’t need
to do anything at all. Nixon, Mit-
chell, and all the rest of THEM
have been playing it much longer
than we have, and they know the
rules quite well. The most frighten-
ing thing is that they MAKE the
rules,

All we have to do is sit back and
wait for that knock on the door, or
on the head. And they don't even
have to knock anymore... .

Thus, the only logical thing to do
with this Mock Mockery is to nomi-
nate George McGovern, It would be
a pleasant change to have an honest,
believable man in the White House.

George Wallace, a man who
stands by his beliefs, though I don't
agree with many of them, made one
observation in 1968 which is still
so true that it hurts. That is that
there isn't a dimes worth of differ-
ence between Hubert Humphrey
and Richard Nixon.

Humphrey represents, and caters
to, old-line Democrats, men like
Richard Daley, That is a mockery
upon the party's name as well as the
principles it is supposedly founded
upon.

George MeGovern is a viable and
preferable alternative. At a gather-
ing of professional journalists I at-
tended a few days ago, the prevail-
ing view of McGovern is that he is
a very HUMAN candidate. Some
also said he is filling the gap Robert
Kennedy's death created. Either
way, McGovern needs to be nomi-
nated. Not for his sake, but for
ours,

So let's do it, Hf the W&L Mock
Convention is everything it claims
to be, its results will be listened to,
looked at, or whatever. There is no
other candidate the Democratic
Party can logically neminate. You
in the Convention have the oppor-
tunity to help George McGovern.
Do it. So much for endorsements

Cietiing back to the manner in
which the Convention is being con-
ducted, | can only say that men who
play small games are themselves
small.

When we have a chance to do w
much. something that will produce
posilive results and do something
for ALL. of us, why should we do
so little and just “play along?”

Enough of games, let us de some-
thing which has a larger—and bet-
ter——purpose than creating a replica
of something which is not worth be
ing imiated

of similar affairs held on U.S. col-
lege campuses each election year.”

An aide to Nelson Rockefeller
said in 1964 that the W&L conven-
tion was the Governor’s next most
important goal after two state pri-
maries.

At the first convention, a fight
broke out in the Kansas delegation,
politely referred to as a “heated set-
to.” Delegates streamed out of the
gymnasium to settle their differences
outside.

William Jennings Bryan emerged
as the winner, and student partici-
pation in'this simulated political pro-
cess had its precedent.

In 1912, the students narrowly
missed electing a dark horse candi-
daet after Woodrow Wilson took
the lead on the first four ballots.

With the second Mock Conven-
tion in 1912 came the first mistake.
The man destined to win the actual
Democratic Convention, Woodrow
Wilson filed in the voting for four
ballots at the W&L Convention. But
for reasons now somewhat obscure
the Mock Convention predicted the
nominee would be Judson Harmon,
Who?

Charles Evans Hughes was cor-
rectly chosen in 1916 as students
eliminated eleven other candidates.

There was no convention in 1920,
setting the stage for perhaps the
most remarkable Mock Conventions
of all time.

For 23 ballots the Mock Con-
vention was deadlocked by support-
ers for Al Smith and William Me-
Adoo. The simulated convention
nominated W&L alumnus, John W.
Davis on the 24th ballot as a com-
promise candidate. Later that year
in New York, it took the Democrats
a record 103 ballots to determine
that the college men in Lexington
were right after all.

Their credibility now respected
across the country, the 1928 Mock
Convention responded accordingly
by accurately nominating Al Smith
on the 17th ballot.

FDR was an easy choice in 1932.
His extended administration ending
in 1945, caused confusion among
Republicans. The GOP's inability to
pick a winner was also reflected in
Lexington. Spurious nominees were
produced at both the 1936 and the
1940 conventions. There was no
convention during the war year of
1944. The year 1948 brought the
convention's last incorrect nomina-
tion, The students chose Senator
Arthur Vandenburg to break a dead-
lock between Thomas Dewey and
Robert H. Taft.

From 1952 on, the Mock Conven-
tion put together a string of correct
guesses. In 1952, California gover-
nor Earl Warren sent a telegram to
his delegates, releasing them to vote
for Dwight D. Eisenhower.

1956 saw the first Democratic con-
vention in 24 years at W&L. Sena-
tor Alben Barkley of Kentucky, the
keynote speaker, suffered a fatal
heart attack in old Doremus Gym-
nasium. The convention recessed
but reconvened at Mrs. Barkley’s in-
sistence and went on to nominate
Adlai Stevenson on the fifth ballot.

Harry Truman came to Lexington
for the 1960 convention. Although
the crucial West Virginia primary
had not been paid, the convention
selected John F. Kennedy with the
help of such political leaders as
Carmine de Sapio of Tammany
Hall.

1964 was a difficult period to
access. While most colleges favored
Henry Cabot Lodge, W&L nomi-
nated Barry Goldwater on the sec-
ond ballot. The senator replied per-
sonally to the convention via tele-
phone.

Space Program:
A Dying Dream

BY MARC SMALL

The dream that put man on the
Moon is dead, Although the Ameri-
can space program has been an
outright success from the White
Sands experiments of the late 40's
through Mariner 9%, boosting the
economy, imereasing our scientific
knowledge and giving us tremend-
ous feedbacks into the commercial
sphere. the dynamic effort that saw
Mercury, Gemini. and Apollo push
our frontiers to the edge of the ter-
restrial system has collapsed be-
neath a welter of cynics who have
questioned its worth and advocated
a “re-ordering of priorities” to uti-
lize money now “wasied” on the
space program in more “relevant”
ways

These questions are not without
merit. Undoubtedly there were those
at the court of Queen Isabella who
advised her not to squander her
gems on the useless schemes of the

BY RAY SWAN

The W&L lacrosse team plays its
most important game of the year to-
day, coming off a shaky 13-11 win
over North Carolina last Saturday
at Wilson Field.

Towson State invades Lexington,
led by attackmen Tim Havens and
Craig Saxon who scored six goals
against Virginia. Like W&L, Tow-
son is nationally ranked and unde-
feated in conference play, having
lost only to a major national power.

“Towson is just so much better
this year than they were last year”
said head coach Dick Szlasa. In ad-
dition to deciding the conference
champs, the game will also decide
who gets the invitation to the
NCAA national tournament.

Last Saturday, both teams got off
to a shaky start but UNC got the
first three goals. Sam Englehart
shoved in two rebounded saves but
North Carolina answered with one
more goal to lead at the end of the
first period.

Scott Neese scored twice in the
second period, assisted by Ed Tog-
netti and Ted Bauer, Brian Chasney
helped Chip Thompkins — score
W&L’s fifth goal, but the Tarheels
also scored three in the period to
lead 7-5 at half. Prior to this game,
the Blue had trailed at halftime only
once, to Navy.

Chasney scored first in the third
period on Jim McCane’s assist with
10:49 left. UNC answered wit hone

Parade Begins
Gala Weekend

Not even VMI could rival the
spectacle that Bill Andrews, parade
chairman, has planned to kick-off
the 15th Washington and Lee Mock
Convention.

The traditional parade will begin
Friday at noon with the simultane-
ous ringing of Lexington’s church
bells. Containing eighty units, the
parade will feature six high school
bands, more than fifty floats spon-
sored by state delegations and can-
didate committees (including one
spectacular float titled U.S.S, Hol-
lins, with appropriate decoration),
numerous Southern Seminary Beau-
ties, Miss Virginia, and several sym-

 

bolic donkeys.

Two of the units which will high-
light the parade are the excellent
Norfolk State College band and the
Kazim Temple clowns, hailed to be
the best in the nation.

Presiding as parade marshal on
Friday will be Virginia’s Attorney
General and high-ranking Demo-
crat, Andrew P. Miller.

The parade, which is expected to
stretch for a mile and a half, will
form at Lexington High School,

scored unassisted to bring W&L
within one, 7-8, Englehart and
Tompkins scored with Chasney’s

assist, and McCane scored unassist-
ed to give the Generals the lead
10-8. Penalties left W&L two men
short and the Tarheels scored again
and trailed 10-9,

Englehart scored twice on assists
by Chasney and Neese. UNC re-
taliated with a goal with 10 minutes
left in the game. The defense im-
proved in the middle of the period,
but broke down with seven minutes
left as UNC closed to within one,
12-11. In the final minutes W&L
spread the Tarheel defense with a
slowdown attack until Englehart
broke free and scored his sixth goal
with the help of Chasney’s fifth as-
sist. Time ran out with North Caro-
lina trying to get off a shot,

Despite the close score, the Blue
beat the Tarheels in several impor-
tant categories. W&L grabbed 88
ground balls to UNC's 44 with Ted
Bauer scooping up 14, The Generals
outshot Carolina 53-39 but the
UNC goalie stopped 20 shots,

Szlasa credited John Lalley for
his play, even though he didn’t
score. Lalley was sick most of last
week and there was some question
as to whether he would play.

Szlasa said he has made no major
changes for today’s game.

a fine performance in this talented
field beating University of Florida
12-3 after succumbing to Princeton
29-3 in the Championship round.

WAL scored first against Prince
ton on a penalty kick by Co-Cap
tain Fred Fletcher but from there on
the Generals were the ones who
committed the penalties. Five off-
side calls resulted in 9 points in
penalty kicks for the Tigers, who

failed to score on the ground against
a tenacious Blue defense led by Al
McWhorter, Charlie Gregory, and
Brian Greig. The W&L scrum got al-
most all the scrumdowns through
the excellent hooking of Bob Dead-

of his career; but the backs were un-
able to break through Princeton's

Also turning in a fine performance
was Larry Cohen, who organized
and directed the Championships.
Against Florida W&L made sev-
eral lineup changes to put in fresh
men at key positions an dthe strat-
egy paid off. The scrum play was
excellent and the lighter W&L
consistently outpushed their
counterparts, The backs, led by
Mike Schaeffer and Lat Purser,
moved the ball quickly and refused

to allow Florida to break loose.

A Dying Dream

(Continued from Page 2)

mad Italian Columbus. Undoubtedly
there were those who recommended
that Henry VII not subsidize the
futile fantasies of John Cabot, Tho-
mas Jefferson was ridiculed for the
Louisiana Purchase; Alaska was re-
fered to as “Seward's Folly.” Yet
these dreams paid off in the long
run: our world teday would be non-
existent except for the faith of these
leaders in the progress of mankind.

It is beyond question that we de-
rive important benefits from the
space program. Every dollar spent
on the exploration of space returns
severalfeld in spin-offs from the

technology we gain. Television,
communications, nuclear energy,

evbernetics—all have been boosted
far beyond expectation by the re-
search originally undertaken for the
space program. Our technology—
with its direct impact on the highly-
industrialized world we live in
has been increased dramtically by
mans drive into space.

Yet. these material benefits are
not the truly important part of the
program, Underlying it there is a

dream. This is the dream of Colum-
bus, Vespucci, Leif Erikson, Magel-
lan, and Drake. This is the dream
that comes from horizon fever and
the urge to know what is beyond the
next ridge. This is the dream that
brought man to America and made
it a nation that provides more free-
doms and material benefits to more
people than any other nation in the
world.

We dare not kill this dream, for
if we do, then we kill as well the
spirit of the nation. Yet we have
killed this dream by strangling it in
red tape, legislative studies, and
cut-backs, so that our space pro-
gram is now but a shadow of its old
self. Our aerospace industry is on
the verge of collapse, the highly-
trained company of engineers that
provided the knowledge behind
Apollo and Mariner are un-employ-
ed, and we are on the verge of los-
ing the technology so laboriously
garnered during the past two de-
cades,

We dare not sacrifice our spirit

will provide but temporary benefits

collapse. The spirit behind Apollo
must be resuscitated: we must con-
tinue our drive into the universe if
for no other reason than to fan the
flames of our spirit and to keep
alive the dreams that founded this
nation on the vision of the few.

“To promote literature in this rising
empire and to encourage the arts
have ever been amongst the warmest
wishes of my heart.”

George Washington

Tonight

House,

Chapel

By ANDY SIMPSON
Approximately 70-80 — students
and members of the W&L com-
munity gathered in Fairfax Lounge
last night to arrange a schedule of
peaceful protest events in Lexing-
ton designed to show President

Nixon that not all people “are
standing in support of his war

policy, but are standing away from
it.” The meeting was prompted by
Nixon's television announcement
Monday evening stating his plans to
mine Haiphong harbor.

A number of suggested avenues
of protest were discussed at the
meeting. For the present, the fol-
lowing moves have been planned:

—starting at 7 p.m. this evening,
a peaceful rally given to prayer and
meditation for peace will be held
at the county courthouse,

—following the prayer session
there will be a peacful march from
the courthouse to Lee Chapel.
the campus, speakers, in-
cluding university professors and
community leaders, will be heard.

—"telegram tables,” hopefully
one each at Kroger’s shopping cen-
ter, the courthouse square, Wash-
ington Hall, and the Student Center
will be set up until 6 p.m. tonight.
Volunteers will assist people desir-
ing to add their names to a joint
telegram and/or petition with word-
ing of protest against the Nixon
war policy. These will be s nt to

the White House and to Senator
Spong (D-Va.).
—encouragement for individuals

to send their own telegrams at $1.25
for 15 words to their representatives.
The toll free number for the tele-

grams is 1-800-542-5769,

The group refrained from out
lining definite plans for future action
beyond today’s activities as the rally
itself is intended to be an informa-
tive, discussion-type affair, out of
which will come ideas for future
action. The rally is scheduled to
coincide with the time of a speech
to be given by James Roche, former
Chairman of the Board of General
Motors, at Lee Chapel. The group’s
aims are to avoid disrupting Mr.
Roche's talk, keep the event peace-
ful and to invite Mr. Roche to
address their own gathering. It is
also hoped that many of those at-
tending the Roche lecture will later
attend the rally.

The suggestion was also made by
Steve Robinson, after confering with
the National Student Lobby in D.C.,

THE RING-TUM PHI

Washington and Lee University’s Weekly Newspaper

that people urge their senators to
support the latest Frank Church
(D-Idaho) amendment concerning
limitation of presidential war
.powers, The bill is due for a vote
in the Senate on Friday.

Bill Mcllhany, representing as he
termed it, “the individual right,”
said he and those of his persuosion
were also opposed to Nixon’s policy
and were interested in a “dump
Nixon” movement. Mr. Mcllhany’s
presence at the meeting prompted
the comment: “Politics makes
strange bedfellows.”

In the course of the meeting, Pete
Swart made the comment that al-
though the desire was to have a
total community effort, “one should
not undersell the significance of a
small southern school protesting the
Nixon policy.”

“The proper education of youth re-
quires not only great ability, but I
fear, more strength than I now
possess.”

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, MAY 10,

Sentor Edward Moore Kennedy
of Massachusetts emerged last week-
end as the W&L Mock Democratic
Convention's nominee for  presi-
dent this year. According to the
convention, Kennedy will team
with Wilbur Mills to complete the
Democrats’ president vice-president
slate,

Kennedy came on strong follow-
ing the third ballot, where front-
runners George McGovern and
Hubert Humphrey appeared dead-
locked at 1489'4 and 1390 votes
respectively. Changes in that ballot
were allowed to be made by con-
vention officials, and the finalized
count for the third ballot left Mc-
Govern with 1140 and Humphrey
with 1333'3 votes, while Kennedy
picked up 531'% votes.

McGovern started out on the first
ballot with a strong lead, and ap-
peared as the early choice of the
convention for the nomination, pick
ing up 1204'5 votes to Humphrey's
754 tallies. The decisive factor in
the first ballot was the commitment

a transcendent juggling act in

TEER EAS

|OUTLOOK andREVIEW
The Choice Of Ted Kennedy

Another wild Mock Convention is now behind us, and this

  

year’s was certainly wilder and more exhaustive than most. The
ultimate choice of Senator Kennedy for President was a big
surprise; but while the accuracy of the outcome may be questioned,
the convention's effectiveness is not.

As little as a month or two ago, one could have justifiably won-
dered if the whole project was coming off at all. If one phenomen-
on could have characterized the American college student this year,
it was his apathy toward Establishment politics, and our student
body was no exception. ‘The Mock Convention leadership faced
an uphill battle all the way to infect our student body with their
own brand of enthusiasm—-and the most remarkable thing about
last weekend's proceedings was the extent to which they had suc-
ceeded.

While the preliminary remarks of both Governor Carter and
Senator Gravel were somewhat less than rousing, Friday's fight
over the platform was a marvelous warm-up for the more serious
business of nomination on Saturday. ‘The patience and durability of
Mike Campilongo (permanent chairman) and Mike Guroian
(Convention clerk) on the podium was commendable.

The inescapable question is: was it accurate? And the answer
is, well, maybe. This has been a bad year for predictions; a couple
months ago Stewart Alsop (and everyone else) said, barring
miracles, Muskie was a shoe-in. The miracle happened, and Mus-
kie’s Presidential star plummeted.

The fact is that anything can happen between now and July
when the Democratic Party will convene in Miami Beach, Four
years ago at this time, Robert Kennedy was still alive and sweeping
like wildfire through the primaries. We live in an age when politi-
cal events and circumstances seem constantly in the process of
tumbling.

If the convention in Miami deadlocks (as ours did Saturday
night) between Hubert Humphrey and George McGovern, Ted
Kennedy will be the logical man to turn to. The Democratic dele-
gates have already witnessed how lackluster Md Muskie is on the
campaign trail, so his hopes to be the compromise candidate must
be counted as slim. If the Democrats have any hopes of beating
Nixon in November, they will turn to Kennedy.

But even if they do, will Kennedy run? Most assuredly, yes.
We don't doubt Kennedy's sincerity when he insists he is not a
candidate; the task of facing an incumbent President is unenviable
for anyone, and another four years would further erase the
memory of the bleak Chappaquiddick incident.

But Kennedy could not refuse a draft this year and still ex-
pect the nomination in 1976, A man cannot abandon his party in
time of crisis.

Our odds-on guess is that there will be no deadlock in July,
and that HLumphrey will once more be his party's standard bearer.
While McGovern seems to be gaining strength in the primary cir-
cuit, our Mock convention showed that he probably will fall short
of the necessary momentum. Saturday he came awfully close to
capturing the nomination on the third ballot, but he had all of the
California and New York votes in his pocket, votes which are
in reality still way up in the air,

Another interesting twist revealed by our Mock proceedings
was the quick decline of support for George Wallace. If this
holds true for the actual convention, Wallace will end up with
little real bargaining power over the other candidates.

There was some initial despondency among the Mock Conven-
tion organizers over the Kennedy nomination—they feared they
were seeing all their year-long efforts for accuracy coming to
naught. But Credentials chairman Fred Franke said that, given
what the students had to go on at this particular time, the outcome
was substantially correct. We are inclined to agree with him. The
state chairmen, for the most part, approached their job seriously
and researched their votes well,

In any event, both ‘Tom Gillespie and Mike Campilongo de-
serve thanks for their dedication and determination to see the Con
vention through to success. Hopefully, as a result of their efforts,
Wl, students will follow through to become involved in the actual
political process this year, through working and voting. We trust
what we saw was not Mock Enthusiasm.

BY JOHN ROBINSON

The Mock Convention protrudes
in one’s memory as a conglomer-
tion of politics, placards, speeches,
music, excitement and boredom.
From the perch of the press bal-
cony, the whole event produced
endless variety for the statewide
reporters,

Upon entering the gym, dele-
gates were infected with the con-
vention atmosphere. The basket-
ball arena had been transformed
into a red, white, and blue, star-
studded bedlam. Candidates’ pic-
tures were omni-present. Fake
straw hats (with the everpresent
red, white, and blue trim) dotted
the floor. And as if General Lee
had returned and rejuvenated
conventional dress, suits or at
least coats - and - ties-abounded.
Simply stated it was the greatest
show in town,

To set the stage for the two day
extravaganza, was the Mock Con-
vention Parade down Washington
Street. Propriety was abandoned,
as “floats” stressed double-enten-
dre, and the ridiculous throughout
the hour long procession.

The convention itself was crowd-
ed the first day. Students with
white-painted faces meandered
among the delegates, gaining lit-
tle attention amid the festive at-
inosphere. Most participants, hav-
ing never seen a Mock Conven-
tion, did not know what was re-
quired of them, and became intent
on just having fun. Quickly, dele-
gates realized that their role in the
affair was quite minimal. There-

Sulls Records A Winner

BY PAT HINELY
Stephen Stills: Manassas
Atlantic SD2-903

Steve Stills has proved with this
2-record set that he IS capable of
putting together an album with a
good sound. A certain amount of
retrogression is evident; some of
the songs on Manassas sound so
much like Buffalo Springfield that
I almost hear Neil Young singing
harmonies.

Stills finally has gotten rid of
the BS&T-Al Kooper brass &
soul backups. It's about time. His
new band has a sound which fits
type of music much better. Joe
Lala on conga & timbales adds
just the right touch of latin-San-
tana rhythm, complementing Dal-
las ‘Taylor's hard-driving style on
traps quite well. Paul Harris’ key-
boards shine through at the right
times—-only the right times. There
are no more organ runs fleeting
uselessly through the background.

The music is still heavily pro-
duced; if the band can play this
music as well in coneert as they
can in the studio, it would be quite
an accomplishment. However, un-
like Stills’ earlier solo efforts, the
sound doesn't overpower the lis-
tener with its intricacy. Its virtue
is its wholesomeness.

Stills hasn't given up on socio
political lyrics, but a song like
“Fallen Eagle” is artistically solid
enough toe stand on its own as an
appeal to stop killing birds or just
good country tune. Byron
Berline, who has played fiddle
with the Byrds, adds the finishing
touch to the old CSN&Y
harmony. Chris Hillman, himself
an ex-lved, can be heard on man
dolin and rhythm guitar, Al Per-
kins on steel guitar is the first
steel plaver to give Jerry Garcia
competition, and Perkins might
come out on top.

Hot Tuna: Burgers

Grunt FTR-1004

Jorma Kaukonen, on Burgers,
has put together his first studio
album. Some of his cuts on earlier
Jefferson Airplane albums have
been quite nice, but he did this
whole album, and the results make
it obvious. The only conclusion to
be drawn is that he can do without
the Airplane, but the Airplane
couldn't do without him.

Kaukonen tracked himself to
perfection on a par with Hendrix.
The blend of electric and acoustic
is iucid enough to make you
reach into the speaker and try to
pick the strings.

Papa John Creach and his elect-
ric fiddle are in evidence on every
cut except “Water Song,” and he
adds the fourth dimension to
every song he plays on. After fifty
vears of playing violin, Creach has
perfected his technique so com-
pletely that he probably could talk
with it if he needed to.

Papa John has a way of moving
up the scale rather than down, and
the squeaky-squirmy sounds he
puts out bridge any gap that might
between St. Louis and San
Pranciseo. Jack Casady proves
that it IS possible to get a melody

The nomination of the Presi-
dential Candidate consumed most
of Saturday. Nomination speeches
were largely lackluster with the
exception of Lawson Turner's
stirring appeal for Wilbur Mills.
Seven ballots were conducted.
However, nine would be a more
accurate total. This convention's
state chairmen had a strange ha-
bit of demanding the right to al-
ter votes. Two times states were
given the chance to change their
minds, Hach ballot brought swirls
of people around state chairmen
as deals were made and remade.

Kennedy voted for basketball
coach Adolph Rupp for Presi-
dent. Duncan Pace described
Klorida as the home of “blue

water, green grass and red necks.”
The Kentucky delegation in later
antics, walked out enmasse to see
the Derby on the tube. Chaos
people, whoever thev are, waved
signs such as: “KILLER KEN-
NEDY” and “END THE LIES".

After half-a-day of voting the
convention turned out to be dead-
locked. Muskie, Kennedy, MeGov-
ern and Humphrey had all made
strong bid, but none received the
1500 plus votes. Constant calls of
“Marshals, clear the aisles!” rang
across the hall, now depleted by
departed lacrosse fans and tanked
delegates. Frustration grew and
nobody looked capable of winning
the nomination and more impor-
tantly the roll calls would appar-
ently continue until doomsday.
The more populous states finally
went to Kennedy and that was the
big push that put the Senator on

top.

Wilbur Mills took the Vice
Presidential voting race. He
soundly defeated Terry Sanford

before an empty auditorium.

The whole thing was totally un-
predictable, which lent it a large
degree of magic. Minute changes
in voting were duly noted by the

The Student Curriculum Com-

the course of the extensive dis-
cussions that resulted in the new
University calendar and the mas-
sive curriculum changes initiated
two years ago. While many long-
sought reforms worked out by
faculty and students were achiev-
ed at that time, the need for an
‘official, responsible student or-
vanization to channel opinion on
curriculum still persists.

Financial Relations

One privilege a W&L, student
has in Lexington and surrounding
communities, but which he often
that of cashing
checks. The purpose of the Stu-
dent Financial Relation Commit-
tee is to preserve this privilege.
The committee will make good
cold checks. The student passing
the bad check is then contacted to
appear before the committee in
order to find out why his check
bounced. The committee must
then decide on the students guilt
and fine him accordingly.

The first offense draws a fine of
between $1.00 and $5.00. For a
second offense there is a fine up to
$10.00, Third offenders may be
fined up to $25.00 and asked to
appear before the .xecutive Com-
mittee.

purpose of the University
Committee is to provide
social, cultural, recreational
activities aimed at the needs and
the student body at

and

interests of

laree. This year’s programs have
included regular weekend combo
parties, weekly folk-singing jams,

a Sunday popular movie program,
and Wnhednesday happy hours, all
taking place in the University
Center Cockpit. In addition, the
committee has been sponsoring
frequent student art exhibits, a
Saturday outdoor musical festival,
and a bridge tournament

Other tasks include running
book collection drives for the Uni
Center Library, selecting
Inaeazine subscriptions for that
une library, and acting as an ad-

versits

visory board to the University
Center Director and to the man-
ager of the Cockpit.

Besides continuing with the
above programs and responsibili-
ties, plans for the future include
considerable expansion of  pro-
erams. Possibilities for the future
include more types of tourna-
ments, such as pool, ping pong,
and chess; a possible student art
festival; more faculty-student dis-
cussions and get-togethers; and
an increase in programs that of-
fer new ways for W&L, students
to get together with students from
surrounding colleges.

The committee seeks members
who display imagination since
fresh ideas are always welcome.
But along with this, members are
also needed who are willing to
work. At the weekly meetings, as-
signments are given which must
be carried out if the committee is
to function properly.

Student Control

he Student Control Committee
tries to serve the best interests of
both the University and the W&L
students by enforcing reasonable
standards of behavior for the stu-
dent body. By taking an active
concern in the behavior (or misbe-
havior) of students, the Commit-
tee tries to promote good relation-
between Washington and
Lee and the Lexington commun-
ity. Because of our unique social
setting, the Committee's jurisdic-
tion is extended to include rela-
tions with the surrounding girls’
s¢ hools also Misconduct or viola-
tions of civil law are viewed as in-
jurious to the reputation of W&L
and unbecoming of a student at
this University.

Destruction of property, inde-
cent exposure, “pranks,” flagrant
financial irresponsibility, and con

ships

duct endangering other persons
may be viewed as unreasonable
student behavior.

It is the task of the Student

Control Committee to assess the
degree of misconduct in each case
and, in interaction with the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee of the
faculty, work to maintain reason-
able standards of conduct through-
out the W&L community. The re-

Air tight fielding throughout the

Sunday the Generals scored early
and held on to beat the neighboring
Keydets. Gutshall tripled Doug

EC Amends Honor Trial Procedure;
Faculty Selects UC Representatives

the Executive Committee, at-
tempting to eliminate what was
termed as the “circus-like atmos
phere” of the public honor trial
procedure, put into action certain
crucial amendments which would

transform a public trial into less of
an adversary operation

The major change is that a de
fendant may no longer have “ad
vocates” (who have usually been
law students), but instead he will
have a counsel or advisor who may
not address the jury directly

Some observers have seen this as

a move to bolster the convicting
powers of the honor system. Bob
Brennan, next year’s EC president,

“if handled properly,
the defendant will have proper pro-
tection

however, said

In other university government
action, the faculty has elected nine
men to serve one-year terms on the

University Council, the joint stu
dent-faculty commitee with principal
jurisdiction in the field of student
affairs

The nine are Drs, Jay D. Cook

Bartlesville, Oklahoma, an under-
graduate senior, was named last
night as the 1972 winner of the
Frank J. Gilliam Award. The pre-
sentation of the prize by University
President Robert E. R. Huntley
came as one of the highlights of
last night's senior banquet.

Also presented were five “Ring-
tum Phi” Awards, given to “any
student or faculty member who has
distinguished himself through any
phase of life at Washington and
Lee.” The awards were presented at
the banquet by Skip Paukert, Editor-

Elect of the Phi. Recipients in-
cluded: senior Roger Munsick;
“Mickey” Philipps, University Di-

Dick Szlasa,
team; Dr.

rector of Photography;

OUTLOOK andREVIEW
On Cashing Student Checks

Up until now, W&L students have enjoyed an easy,
convenient arrangement with local merchants with regard to

 

cashing checks. But no more.

Late last year and early this year, signs began going up
in Lexington stores and restaurants declaring in bold letters:
“Checks Cashed For Amount of Purchase Only.” So far this
year, the Student Financial Relations (affectionally known,
as “Cold Check”) Committee has had to reimburse over 800
hounced checks, totaling more than $2000. These checks were
written by around 15 per cent of the student body, according
to information we received from the committee's chairman,
Chuck Lee.

This all-time record of financial irresponsibility on the
part of W&L men has thrown the Cold Check members and
the EC leadership into a minor panic. The problem is further
hampered by the continual failure of student violators to
appear before the committee when notified; hence, the com-
mittee’s money gets tied up in reimbursements for old checks
on which they can't seem to collect, and merchants become,
in the process, ever more reluctant to take a student's check.

As the old saying goes, something’s got to give. And the
consequences, if the situation worsens at the present rate,
could be disastrous. Some are already suggesting that the
Cold Check Committee, and hence all student protection, be
eliminated, And President Huntley himself, discussing this
problem with Bob Brennan, Steve Robinson, and Lee, sug-
gested the possibility that check cashing privileges might
eventually have to be suspended in university facilities. That
would mean no more check-cashing in the Co-op, in the
Cockpit, or the Bookstore.

As an immediate response, the Student Financial Relations
Committee has decided to cease purchasing all bad checks
written after May 10. This is approximately a week earlier
than usual. As plans stand at this time, however, the com-
mittee will resume normal operations in September.

Whether they will be allowed to continue throughout
next year without some drastic changes depends on the
students. This much is clear: the latent consequences of
continued student negligence are scary. And only those stu-
dents who have heretofore thought nothing of bouncing a
few checks can provide the essential remedy.

has recruited the personnel that has boosted the W&L record
to 11-2 each of the last two seasons. A second factor is the
team itself. While most students have been engulfed in the
“country club semester,” the squad has been hard at work
earning its top ten ranking. Instead of sauntering off to the
beach or elsewhere during spring break, the stickmen went
north to play more lacrosse games. Certainly a third influence
on the lacrosse success story has been the fans. Who can
forget the large, and enthusiastic (if slightly inebriated)
crowd that gave the Blue squad a_ standing
after the 10-9 loss to Virginia? Did you ever notice the

A Question of Morality

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:
On the very evening that a group
of concerned people gathered to
protest not only the immorality of
a certain war, but immorality in
general; on that very evening at
least one heart was deaf to the
message. He was a sad exception in
an otherwise sincere assemblage.

As the story goes, some careless
fool lost his wallet that night. Grate-
fully, the wallet was returned. Do
not get the fool wrong, now. He
sincerely thanks the returnee.

Still, considering the spirit of that
evening, he would also like to
express the hope that whoever it
was that lifted the small sum of
money from the wallet before it
was returned, did so with the inten-
tions of contributing to the cause
of morality.

As the story closes, be relieved
to know that all was not lost. The
unfortunate fool's draft card was
returned, untouched with the money-
less wallet. After all, who'd want
another one of those?

Andy Simpson, Jr., °75

Bill Datz On The Prowl

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Starting tonight, every student liv-
ing in the dorms had better lock
his door. If he doesn't, something
will be stolen. In the past, a wallet,
a basketball, an album and cash
have been stolen from my room,
and the theives haven't been caught.
I've decided that that is a pretty
good life and will turn to robbery
until | get my wallet and ball. Do
not leave lacrosse sticks anywhere

don't have one, yet, and I'd like
one. Do not leave books lying

Daniel Named
All-American

By ROGER MUNSICK

It has been a balmy spring in-
deed for Washington and Lee's
athletic teams. After a frantic finish
against Virginia's Cavaliers last
Saturday, the lacrosse team, at long
last, received a coveted bid to the
NCAA championships. Even at this
writing, the baseball team, one of
three Generals squads to bring home
CAC titles from last weekend's
Spring Sports Festival, is itself seek-
ing an invitation to the NCAA reg-
ional tournament.

Aimost lost amidst these final
exciting weeks, however, has been
another significant athletic accomp-
lishment for the University, the
selection ef basketball captain Mike
Daniel, as an honorable mention

NCAA College Division squad and
as an Academic All-American on
the team chosen by College In
formation Directors. Washington and
Lee has produced only a handful
of basketball plavers who have
reached such a level of distinetion,
and Daniel's statisties alone qualify
him for this elite group. He played
four varsity scoring 1665
points for a 17 points per game

“Letting

By LEX McMILLAN

One year ago this month “Letting
Go” first appeared in this paper.
The first line of that column was
the bold assertion: ‘the honor sys-
tem is dead.’ A year has passed and
the system has been discussed, studi-
ed, defended and attacked. It seems
appropriate at this time to re-
consider what was said a year ago.

In brief I asserted that the honor
system was a primitive and out-
moded structural survival which was
ineffectively persisting in a modern
bureaucratic society. | suggested
that the geographic, social and eco-
nomic diversity of the student body
was a hindrance to establishing a
consensus as to what honor is. In
view of these factors | suggested

that codification was the solution
for the salvation of the honor
system.

After a year of consideration it
appears that this evaluation was
somewhat shallow. Indeed, codifica-
tion and many measures of so-called
reform (such as a graduated pen-
alty) are fundamentally contradic-
tory to the ideals and the purpose
of the honor system. The very na-
ture of the system excludes half-way
measures and to proceed in such
a manner at this time would only
speed the sickness which now char-
acterizes the honor system and in-
sure its ultimate demise

In addition, | must say that the
pronouncement of the honor sys-
tem’s death was certainly premature
a year ago and, though an easy
and perhaps defensible assertion at
this time, it is still premature. We
can look around and. with a certain
focus, say with some justification
that the henor system no longer

Snakes Sighted

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:
Anyone who has played tennis on
the clay courts has, at one time
or another, had the annoyance of
losing a tennis ball over the fence
in the tangle of weeds bordering
the courts on two sides. When one
is lucky enough to find the ball he
usually can’t avoid the briars and
the poison ivy. With the situation
already bad enough, there is now
a new added hazard—snakes.

still numerous students who are
completely dedicated to the system,
its ideals and purpose and to ignore
their determined existence, even
though perhaps a minority, would
be a failure to view the entire
spectrum of attitudes.

It appears that many students are
suffering from a failure of con-
viction. Many still nominally sup-
port the honor system but are un-
willing to see it enforced. The
spirit of tolerance which is pro-
moted by a liberal arts education
is certainly a benefit to man but to
carry tolerance to extremes involves
a severe loss of balance. The world
is not so diverse nor morality so
relative that honor cannot have
basic enduring absolutes. In fact,
once a society begins to refer to
honor or morality in purely rela-
tive terms it has opened the Pan-
dora’s Box of its own destruction.

Theft is dishonorable. To steal
from a thief is dishonorable. And
yel, we now allow the presence of
theft in this community. Our stu-
dent generation, represented by a
jury of twelve, has in fact endorsed
a form of theft. This does not mean
that honor is changing or evolving.
It means that honor is dying.

Regardless of the underlying
motivations, it is a fact that many
students do not support the honor
system. It is chiefly in this sense
that the system is dying. People
talk of the application of the honor

system to certain specific areas,
This is an indication of what is

graphic phenomenon; it is a way of

There is an old but often mis

states Wars are not won by fighting
unimportant battles of the periphery
of an enemy's land, but, rather,
only by engaging in decisive thrusts
against his heartland. The Romans,
even when their own homeland was
attacked by Hannibal, realized the

voluntarily picked up by a com-
munity dedicated to living the moral
life.

It appears that the honor system
is rapidly becoming a yoke rather
than a shield. It is time to recognize

this. C. 8. Lewis once noted that
there are two positions one can
take toward evil and both are

equally dangerous. One is to deny
its existence and the other is to be
attracted to it. It will insure the
death of the honor system if we
fail to realize the crisis that con
fronts us and act upon it.

The solution? | would no longer
say codification is called for be-
cause that would merely obfuscate
the issue. We don't speak of living
the honor system; we speak of liv-
ing under the honor system. The
distinction is crucial. It is unquest-
ionable that society needs systems
to preserve stability and order and
insure the safety of its members.
Thus, W&L also needs such a sys-
tem. However, it is blasphemous to
refer to a system of law as a system
of honor.

The time has come for each indi-
vidual to examine himself and de-
cide if he is truly dedicated to liv-
ing the honor system. If he is noi
then his voice should be heard. If a
majority of students no longer de-
sire to struggle for the ideals of our
honor system then we should drop
the pretense and cease to congratu-
late ourselves on having a com-
munity of trust. On the other hand,
if there are still many who are dedi-
cated to our honor system, then
those who do not feel capable of
meeting its requirements should
seck their education elsewhere.

It seems that we are rapidly ap-
proaching a crucial juncture. To go
on without a positive sense of
dedication and direction will result
in a system which functions in a
lopsided and paradoxical fashion,

Baseball Squad
Wins Title,
Seeks NCAA

By DON McMILLAN

After a false start on Friday, May
12 the Generals’ baseball team was
finally able to open up its segment
of the CAC Baseball Tournament
the next morning, Saturday, May
13 at Southwestern. The team ar-
rived in Memphis with a 8-7 won-
lost record following consecutive
victories over Lynchburg College
and VMI earlier in the week. Their
first game was originally scheduled
for Friday morning, but after two
innings with the score tied 1-1 the
skies opened up and a steady down-
pour washed out the game.

The field at Southwestern was
finally ready for playing on at
10:00 a.m. Saturday morning and
so the Generals restarted their game
with Sewanee. Because of the rain
all remaining games had to be play-
ed on Saturday and they were
limited to 5 innings, the minimum
official playing time.

Grayson Fitzhugh took the mound
against Sewanee and picked up a
close 2-1 victory. Ellie Gutshall and
Dave Otey provided the timely hit-
ting which produced the needed
runs. Gutshall’s over the shoulder
catch in the last inning with the
tying run on second clinched the
win,

In the second game _ lefthander
Hal Jackson got the nod against
Centre and coasted to a 10-1 vic-
tory. Jackson was provided with a
very comfortable lead primarily due
to power hitting of Gutshall, who
had 2 doubles and a towering 4
bagger, and of Don Hathway,.

Going into the third game against
Washington University, the peren-
nial favorite, both W&L and WU
had identical 2-0 records. It was
clear from the outset that the winne:
of this game would at least have a
share of the championship, Rod
Ferrandino started for the Generals
as the home team’s pitcher.

From the first inning of the game
both teams threatened to score but
fine fielding especially by the Gen-
erals kept the game scoreless until
the bottom of the fifth. In the last
inning the loaded the bases
with a single by Hathway, a walk
to Gutshall and a fielder’s choice
by Doug Clelan. One out later
Coach Joe Lyles pulled his trump
card and sent Fitzhugh up to the
plate to pinch hit.

With the count of 2
strikes Fitzhugh pushed a ground
ball single through the right side of
the infield for the game winning
run. The final score was 1-0 and
gave the team a 3-0 record

Generals Grab ‘Big Bell’
For CAC Champtonship

Washington and Lee University’s
charter airplane was considerably
heavier returning last weekend from
Memphis, Tenn., where the Gen-
erals picked up a 300-pound bell,
symbolic of the College Athletic
Conference overall athletic champ-
ionship,

The W&L athletes also won three
smaller bells, for winning competi-
tion in golf, tennis, and baseball.
The W&L track team tied for third
place.

All the hardware was won during
the three-day Spring Sports Festival
staged by the conference at South-
western University. The big bell is
representative of the overall champ-
ionship following competition in
nine sports among the five con-
ference member schools,

In tennis, the Generals swept all
four opponents, beating Washington
University 7-1, and defeating Centre,
Sewanee and Southwestern by
identical 6-3 scores. Individual
champions were Marshall Washburn,
no, 5 for the Generals in singles,
lim Thompson in no. 4 singles,

Thompson and John Embrey in the
no. 2 doubles and Washburn and
Stan Taylor in the no. 3 doubles,

The W&L golf team won _ the
36-hole chamionship with a 598
total, four strokes under runner-up
and defending champion Sewanee’s
602. W&L’s Jack Marquess was the
medalist on the first day of competi-
tion with a 74.

In track, the Generals’ conference
champions were Robert Fallis in
the discus with a toss of 137-8,
Stu Nibley in the mile with a time
of 4:24.88 (a new W&L record),
and Steve Darsie in the 880 with
a 2:00.5 clocking. W&L compiled
45 points to tie Sewanee for third
place in the track meet, won by
Southwestern with 95 points. Wash-
ington University was second with
71,

For W&L it was their third over-
all championship since the confer-
ence was formed in 1962, the other
titles coming in 1967-68 and 1968-
69. Washington University has won
the title six times and Southwestern
once,

“Letting Go”

dents have enjoyed the luxuries of
unlocked doors, unproctored exams,
and unguarded possessions, We have
perhaps taken for granted the in-
estimable compliment of being trust-
ed. It is difficult to imagine that
anyone would desire to sce the end
of these things.

A wise man once said the fol-
lowing to the members of his com-
munity:

It is not my business to pass

judgement on those outside, Of

those who are inside, you can
surely be the judges ‘

You must drive out this evil-

doer from among you.

This was St. Paul speaking to the
Church at Corinth but the wisdom
of his words is quite applicable to
our community here. We come to-
gether with the understanding that
we are all honorable men. In so
doing we implicitly place ourselves
in a position to be judged by tne
other members of the community.
fhe presence of honor is crucial to
the community. If we fail to en-
force our own code then we are
undermining the very base of the
Washington and Lee community
and are paving the way to mediv-

crity. No one likes to see men
kicked out of school, but surely we
don't want to see the end of our
community.

Individualism is essential to
complete personal development but
when an individual comes into a
community he must surrender sone
of his personal freedom for the
good of the community as a whole.
If you are offended by the implica-
tions of this column, then you have
failed to understand the value of
community honor and you don't
belong at Washington and Lee.
There is room for great diversity
and personal freedom at Washing-
ton and Lee but when the purely
selfish desires of the individual be-
gin to destroy the special treasure
of a community such as ours then
the community has the right and

the responsibility to remove this
influence.
Inevitably the individual must

surrender part of his personal frec-
dom to the group. If you think
the destruction of the honor system
will mean greater individuality, you
are mistaken. The alternative is a
community without trust, ordered
by a system of law rather than
honor; a system which is a yoke
rather than a shield,

game. With all due fairness to Fer-
randino both teams were more in-
terested in getting the necessary five
innings in before the twilight faded
for good. Southwestern scored 3
runs in the bottom of the fourth
inning and won 3-0,

This left the team with an over-
all 3-1 record, but Sewanee beat
Washington University 1-0 and this
gave the W&L team undisputed pos-
session of first place.

Team leaders for

the Generals
were Ellie

Gutshall with a .S00 avg., Hathway

Doug Clelan as well as his .300

raised the team’s overall record to

Daniel Named
All-American

(Continued from page 2)

ways. As Washington and Lee coach
Verne Canfield puts it. “Mike is an
outstanding young man in every
respect. We have had no player in
my years here, who has received
as much recognition, as many
honors, as Mike has, No player has
ever had more respect from his
teammates,”

The record would seem to bear
out Canfield’s assesment of the
esteem in which Daniel is held.
Twice, he has been chosen team
captain. A Dean's List student. he
was named an Academic All-
America at the close of the 1970-71
season, and elected to ODK here
at W&L last March. Twice, Daniel
was a member of the CAC all-
tournament team, and he was the
conference MVP after his junior
season,

Daniel who comes from Cincin-
nati, and who was recruited by a
service academy and an Ivy League
school, came to Washington and
Lee largely as a result of the Un'-
versity’s small college atmosphere.
“| liked the idea of a liberal aris
education,” he recalls, “I wanted
a math or physics major and the
classes were small. | also felt I
could play ball here. It was reall,
friendly—-a lot different from the
big city.” Reb Bauer, the Washing-
ton and Lee player who acted as
Daniel's guide during his visit, also
influenced the young prospect to
come to Lexington.

Looking back on his four years,
Daniel says he wouldn't change any-
thing if he had the chance. “There
have been a lot of challenges,” he
says, “a lot of competition, a lot of
feelings, even some hate.” He ai-
tributes his own success to his team-
mates, especially Doug Clelan, who
amassed many of his record assists
on feeds to Daniel for baskets.
Indeed, it has been team play that
has marked Daniel's years at Wash-
ington and Lee. “We don't have
better’ players,” he comments, “we
have better teams. Our schedules
are harder the next few years, but
we'll never have a loser as long as
Coach Canfield is around.”

Fresh off what he believes ha,
been an outstanding recruiting year
Canfield himself nonetheless admits
that a player, and more importantly.
an individual, of Daniel's caliber
will certainly be missed. “You don’t
replace a kid like that,” he states.
He's one of the best ballplayers
and captains I've had in fifteen years
of coaching. He's had to work,
he’s not a natural. But when the
ball is tossed up, Mike Daniel be-
comes a great ballplayer.”

 

Editor's Blasted

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

After reading John Robinson's
article on his impressions of the
mock convention, I find once again
that | must take my pen in hand,
Mr. Robinson's article might have
been better titled “mock impres-
sions,” especially when his com-
ments make it clear that he must
have been daydreaming up there in
the press box. The tenor of Mr.
Robinson's article was, to me, a
bit offensive; I don't care for that
kind of subtle snideness.

Perhaps I should enumerate what
was not only an attack but an
article fraught with blatant inac-
curacies. 1) Why Mr. Robinson has
such a low opinion of coats and
ties and General Lee, I'll never
know. But for some reason he seem-
ed to feel they were improper for
such an occasion, 2) The platform
was 42 planks, not 41, and there
was debate scheduled only on 20,
and there was not to be a roll call

vole o nevery plank, only those
petitioned,

3) | wonder if Mr. Robinson was
there during Senator Gravel’s

speech. He implies the Senator was
well received. | would say the dele-
gates were nothing short of rude.
4) There is nothing strange about
changing votes, especially in late:
ballots. 5) Mr. Robinson had no
experience on the floor to be able
to cal Ithe convention only remotely
educational—had he witnessed the
confusion that caused Massachusetts
to desert McGovern, the confused
challenges, the exasperation of a
floor organization, his comments
would surely have been different.
Having finished with Mr. Robin
son, | must take a turn at Skip
Paukert in the editorial column. |

call your attention to the statement
“Our odds-on guess is that
Humphrey will once again be the
party’s standard bearer. While Mce-
Govern seems to be gaining strength,
our Mock Convention showed that
he will probably fall short of the
necessary momentum.” If, and I
make a strong if, our convention
“showed” that McGovern will fall
short, it certainly “showed” that
Happy Hubey will fall short, too.
And now a word to Brian Grieg’s
reply to an earlier letter of mine.
I'm very glad that Mr. Grieg gets
along so well with Mr. Meem as
to defend him. But, he has a mighty
weak defense. I still remember all
the lofty promises made by Mr.
Meem when he sold me my dance

groups promised, but in the number

322 Students Get Degrees

Degrees were awarded to 322 stu-
dents in commencement exercises
yesterday. By tradition, President
Robert E. R. Huntley delivered the
principle address before a large as-
sembly of graduating students and
their families.

Degree totals included a_ juris
doctor for 60 students in the Law
School, and some 262 Bachelor
of arts or science degrees conferred
to senior undergraduates.

Activities began formaily on
Wednesday with the Baccalaureate
sermon, delivered by Dr. James
Graham Leyburn, who retires this
year after 25 years at Washington
and Lee, including ten as dean of
the university. Dr. Leyburn spoke
on “The Seventh Deadly Sin.”

Dr. Newton Thomas of Rich
mond, who also retires this year
from a 32-year teaching career at
Union Theological Seminary, pre-
sided at the service held in the
Evans Dining Hall.

Dr. Leyburn identified the seventh
deadly sin as that of sloth. “The
Greeks, as usual, had an excellent
word for it,” noted Leyburn.
“*Acedia’ adds to ‘sloth’ the con-
notiation of apathy, of heedlessness,
of not permitting oneself to feel the
kind of sympathy that leads to
action,”

“Do we see the loneliness of
those whose lives touch ours, the

served as dean of the college from
1955 until he was named ninth
president of the institution in 1963,
the first alumnus to be elected.

 

misery and suffering and need, the
yearning for affection and reassur-

ance?” And if we see it, do we
give the personal response that
might relieve the distress of the

mind? If we do not, we have been
guilty of sloth; and true to its
insidious nature, that indulgence is
the first step toward allowing our-
selves not to perceive in any real
sense the need of people around us,
so that We may remain uninvolved.”

Leyburn asserted that the solution

to the pitfalls of laziness and
indolence lies in the meaning of
W&L’s own latin motto, Non

incautus futuri (translated, “not un-
mindful of the future’).

The American Dream, Leyburn
continued, “was the work of vigor-
ous and active men; and at its best
reflected a humanity, an essential
kindliness that lifted men’s hearts.”

“In recent years we have heard
that the American Dream is fad-
ing.” the sermon concluded, but “our
Dream will come to new life be-
cause of those who renounce the
comfortable lethargy of sloth and
stir up the gift that is in them,
because of all those who willingly
accept the call to be true men.”

Leyburn’s address was well-re-
ceived by the large crowd of stu-
dents and parents in attendance. He
had previously been named in the

A Welcome To The Freshmen

For many of you incoming freshmen, this copy of the
Ring-tum Phi may be one of your first contacts with upper-
class students at Washington and Lee. We would like to
welcome you to the university and hope that it lives up to
all your expectations,

 

Your is one of the largest freshmen classes ever to come
this way, numbering nearly 400. We imagine, therefore, that
those first hectic weeks of getting to know the school and
each other in September will be even more hectic than usual.
As a preliminary, we'd like to offer a few lines of advice culled
from our own past experiences,

Kirst of all, when you arrive you will be subjected to a
long, and sometimes tedious series of activies, known affect-
ionately as Freshman orientation. During the first days, you
will be herded en masse around the campus and out to the
Natural Bridge Hotel for a series of talks, presentations, and
discussions concerning all sorts of campus activities and
academic matters. While all of these programs will certainly
not interest you, pay attention as best you can. Particularly
important will be the day-and-a-half at Natural Bridge where
you will be able to ask questions of the dormitory counselors
who will be staying with you and where the Executive Com-
mittee wil be available to clear up any misunderstandings
you may have about the operation of the university's Honor
System,

As you know, the Honor System at Washington and Lee
is one of the most distinctive aspects of the university. Your
understanding of its scope, jurisdiction, and purpose is ab-
solutely essential to your future years as a W&L student,
for you will no doubt at some point encounter a case in
which a fellow student will be asked to leave the university
after conviction for an honor violation.

After orientation is out of the way, then comes Rush. It
is obvious to anyone who has kept up with W&L during
the past few years that fraternities have lost considerable
strength here. But nevertheless, they are still a vital part of
campus life, and you cannot afford to ignore them. We recom-
mend that every freshman, whether or not he plans to join
a house, go ahead and sign up for Rush. Though it may be
demanding, strenuous, and, at times, a little bit wild, fra-
ternity rush remains the best way we know of to meet upper-
classmen and get to know them during the opening weeks of
the semester. It is well worth your while, and there is plenty
of time during the rush period to decide which, if any house,
you think is right for you.

We look forward to seeing you in Lexington next fall
and hope you give some thought to these few words of
guidance before you arrive,

—N.ELP.

A Few Words of Gratitude

It is rare indeed for a man to serve just four years as
an administrator and, during so brief a tenure, to leave
such a large impression on his university as has William
McC, Schildt, Dean Sehildt has seen W&L pass through some
momentous changes—a revamped curriculum, a liberalization
of student social regulations, the inauguration of a bold, new
building program. And while this has happened, Bill Schildt
has been at the heart of the decision-making operations in
Washington Hall—as Associate Dean and Aeting Dean of
Students, as Associate Dean of Admissions, and as the co-
ordinator of Freshman Year.

Last month Dean Schildt resigned to take a new turn in
his fast-moving career, to join the law firm of Miles and
Stockbridge in Baltimore this August.

His decision to leave for corporate practice is certainly an
understandable one, but we cannot allow Bill Sehildt to slip
away without first expressing our thanks for his outstanding
service and dedication to Washington and Lee, Since growing
with W&L, first as an undergraduate, he has acquired a love
for the university which is immediately evident to anyone
who talks with him, After he graduated from the W&L Sehoo!
of Law (number one in his class) and joined the law faculty,
the question of how far Bill Schildt would be going became
a favorite topic for student speculation,

Most of all, Dill Schildt has gained the admiration and
respect of the dormitory counselors, who have been directly
responsible to him for handling all the problems of the first
year men, Faced with even the most delicate dilemmas. thes
have found Dean Sehildt to be a straightforward, fair-minded

advisor in all manner of affairs.

Fortunately, the university has found an able replacement
for Sechildt by appointing Financial Aid Direetor Hill Noell to
assume his duties, but may we register not only our thanks
to Bill Sehildt for the job he has done, but also our hopes that,
for the good of the university, he will remain associated with
WAL in the future

‘Serve Your Neighbor...’

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

I address this to all incoming
freshmen. Class of °76.

Thirty-eight miles north of Wash-
ington and Lee University is a
mental institution. For a number
of years, Washington and Lee has
supplied volunteers to work with
patients on a regular basis through-
out the school year. | am_ inviting
you to join our volunteer program.
The volunteers spend about two
hours in the hospital visiting and
another two hours in transportation
to and from the institution, Ideally,
the volunteer should visit on a
regular basis, either weekly or bi-
weekly. Progress with the patients
can be made much faster though if
the volunteer visits once a week
every week, In coming to Wash-
ington and Lee I hope you will
consider this opportunity to serve
your neighbor on a regular basis,

Finnell Attacks Woodruff
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

For the last two years, letters
from Stephen C, Woodruff, as he
brazenly signs himself, have ap-
peared with distressing frequency
in the Ring-tum Phi, their tone
bordering between forensic indigna-
tion and whining anxiety. His

vitriolic pen has touched heavily
upon all facets of human endeavor
and human nature, and his rasping
barbs of criticism have pierced the
tranquility of countless, hapless
students,

Stephen C. Woodruff’s latest line-
up of innocent victims, as witnessed
in the last issue, included Skip
Paukert, Brian Greg, Bert Meem,
John Robinson, and the Goose
Creek Symphony, God only knows
who else, in his rush to condemn,
Stephen C. Woodruff forgot to list

E. Lee, who Stephen C. Woodruff
seems to have adopted as his very
own patron saint.

In the aforementioned installment,
Stephen C. Woodruff pronounced
judgment on John Robinson for hav-

Mock Convention planks by one,
and for using a tone of “snideness”
that Stephen C, Woodruff, the self-
proclaimed master of nuance, found

 

Natural Food Shop Opens

By DON MARSHALL

Ever since ecology replaced Viet
Nam as the main topic for discus-
sion, people have become conscious
of the world around them. As a
direct result of this environmental
consciousness, natural foods have
become very popular.

Last year, Lexington saw it first
natural food store, offering an
ample selection of edibles relating to
microbiotic theory. The store closed
and, after a brief intermission, the
Shenandoah Valley Natural Food
Store has sprouted and started to
grow. The owners, Nancy and
Howard Ferguson. are extremely
friendly and very optimistic about
its success. Possessing a great deal
of experience with natural foods,
they decided to open the store when
they moved east from California.
Afier looking at different cities in
the area, they decided that the
Shenandoah region best suited their
life style.

Most people are unsure as to
what the terms organic and natural
really mean in relation to food.
Nancy explains that “organic foods
are those grown without sprays or
pesticides and also those grown on
soil built up through addition of
humus and organic fertilizers.
rather than artificial fertilizers.”

“These foods are better,” she con-
tinues, “because what you eat gives
your body benefits, (vitamins, min-
erals, etc.) instead of empty calories.
Most people are surprised at how
good natural foods really taste.”

The last statement is the hardest
thing to get across to those who
have never enjoyed the natural
flaver of these foods.

Although the store has been open
only two weeks, townspeople and
students, (many of them who were
originally just curiosity seekers)
have wandered into the shop and
enjoyed the friendly atmosphere.
Most beginners are cautious and
select a sampling of foods which
bear names similar to their custom-

arty favorites. Hence, peanut and

are popular choices. Once hooked

“a bit offensive.” That's just “a bit”
amusing, considering that Stephen
C, Woodruff’s writing has always
struck me as grossly offensive, and
his manner exceedingly offensive.
Ah, well. What is the antidete
for Stephen C. Woodruff’s misguid-
ed conscience and bombastic utter-
ings other than cotton for our ears?
Thank you for printing this. I
purposely waited until the Ring-tum
Phi's last issue to write, so that I
wouldn’t have to endure Stephen C,
Woodrufl’s irate rebuttal, knowing
that the best way to stop his fatuous
mouthings is to throw a protective
obstacle in his path: summer vaca-
tion.

Dress Criticized

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Having attended many athletic
events on the Washington and Lee
Campus since I was a student, I
have been most impressed by the
change in behavior and dress over
the years. After seeing the lacrosse
game with the University of Vir-
ginia, | am compelled to comment.

Just as dress and polite language
do not necessarily make the man,
neither do undress and obscene
language make the man.

Without making a value judgment
myself, I would like to remind stu-
denis at Washington and Lee of
a Maxim attributed to Aristotle, that
true virtue is placed at an equal
distance between the opposite vices.

A Conservative

Views Local
Vietnam Protest

Guest Column
By J. P. WOODLEY

The days of the Strike are over.
A new generation of W&L men has
come, students who don't even
remember the events of 1970 in
Lexington. Those who were here
remember with disgust the antics
which interferred with their aca-
demic pursuits in May cf 1970. The
events of the three weeks ago stand
in marked contrast to the frenzied
reaction to Cambodia, and a few
observations are in order concern-
ing the differences.

The hand-out which the antiwar
groups prepared and disiributed
reads more like something the Na-
tional Taxpayers’ Union would
come oul with than a peace mani-
festo. There was even a swat at
the national debi, that perrenial
target of right-wing abuse. The thing
was almost rational, indicating that
perhaps the antiwar forces have
learned a dangerous lesson, Another
feature which was missing was the
deliberate misspelling of “America”
as “Amerika.” | always thought that
one was kind of cute, but it seems
to have gone the way of all flesh.
A pily.

I have been told that in ‘70 the
protests didn't even get off the
ground until the studeni govern-
ment jumped on the bandwagon.
Fhis year the EC seemed to be act-
ing with more sense. Presideni
Robinson has gone on record ask-
ing people to write their congress-
men, of something like that. but no
consensis is available from the
body as yet. Opinion leaders, in the
end, are betier seen than heard,

The danger seems past, so we
can all breathe a sigh of relief,
But ii would be definitely in orde:

iO =OXPfess appreciation to the
organizers of the protest for its
orderly mature. The line between

eXereising one’s own First Amend-
ment fights and violating someone
else's is a thin one, but it was
scrupulously respected by everyone
concerned three weeks ago,

Daniel, McWhorter
Receive Top Awards

Mike Daniel, a senior from Cin-
cinnati, whose leadership qualities
on and off the basketball court
made him one of Washington and
Lee’s most honored competitors, has
been chosen W&L’s Most Valuable
Athlete for 1971-72.

Al McWhorter, of Montgomery,
Alabama, a veteran mainstay in the
Generals’ football line, was award-
ed the Wink Glasgow Award for
spirit and sportsmanship. Stu Nibley,
a rising sophomore and a student in

both basketball and track was
chosen Outstanding Freshman
Athlete.

They were presented their awards
during W&L’s annual Spring Sports
Barbecue, which winds up the
athletic year, In all, 199 monograms
and 112 numerals for participation
were presented to the 327 students

who took part in intercollegiate
athletics during the year. That repre-
sents nearly 25 per cent of the

overall undergraduate student body.

During the athletic year, W&L’s
11 varsity sports posted an overall
record of 93 victories against 71
defeats and one tie. Winning sea-
sons were posted by basketball
(17-9), golf (7-2), lacrosse (12-3),
tennis (13-7), track (4-3) and base-
ball (11-10), while the wrestling
team was even at 6-6-1. Conference
championships were won in basket-
ball, swimming, baseball, golf and
tennis, while lacrosse won the
South Atlantic Division title.

W&L won the overall champion-
ship in the College Athletic Confer-
ence, its third title since the con-
ference was founded in 1962.

Daniel, whose 1,665 points placed
him fourth on the all time Generals’
list, was a four-year letterman and
a two-time basketball captain. He
was three times an all CAC pick,
and twice received Academic All-
American honors, He was named an
Honorable mention College Division
All-American at the close of his
senior season.

MeWhorter was honored for the
dedication and inspirational quali-
ties he demonstrated during three
