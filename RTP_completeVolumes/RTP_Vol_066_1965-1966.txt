Fraternity pledging during the re-
cently-completed Rush Week fell off
slightly from last year’s figures, as
294 freshmen representing 74.0 per
cent of the class of 1966 accepted fra-
ternity bids. In 1964, 267 freshmen,
79 per cent of their class, accepted
bids. This year, 96.8 per cent( 332)
of the 343 entering freshmen regis-
tered for Rush; last year only 84.4
per cent registered. Phi Ep led fra-
ternities in numbers pledged, with
29 freshmen plus one sophomore, an
acceptance rate of 55 per cent of bids
extended. (The campus record for
freshman _ pledging during Rush
Week is held by Kappa Sig, which
pledged 26 in 1962). Pi Phi and Phi
Delt both pledged nineteen boys,
while DU, Phi Gam, Sigma Nu, and
ZBT pledged seventeen each.

Interfraternity Council president
Chuck Griffin Monday night expres-
sed disappointment over the appar-
ent ineffectiveness of the present
method of enforcing Rush regula-
tions. Fines totalling more than
$1,000 were imposed; not one fra-
ternity finish Rush Week “clean.”
Griffin commented that most frater-
nities seemed to feel that “an extra
minute or two” with their rushees
or away from their tables in the
quad was worth being fined. As a
result, the IFC will discuss new
means of penalizing houses for Rush
Week violations.

ing Rush Week are:

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Traditions

“But to think of Washington and Lee is to believe in an
ideal.

“It is to believe that this ideal shall be free, free from new
threats as well as old restraints. It is to believe this ideal may
preserve its liberty against the modern tyrannies of standard-
ization. Humbly seeking to learn from the processes of other
educational effort, this ideal shall be independent of the conta-
gion of conformity, the assumption that every institution must
do exactly the same thing in exactly the same way at exactly
the same time.’

Francis P, Gaines, October 25, 1930

President Cole’s speech last week wandered from his ex-
pected message of steady growth and expansion to become a
plea for maintaining Washington and Lee’s speaking and con-
ventional dress traditions. The address, which was expected by
neither students nor men close to the President, received warm
approval by the student body. Our question is, however, why
would a man in President Cole’s position devote one of his two
major addresses of the school year to a topic of this nature?

Are Washington and Lee’s traditions as valuable to the
welfare of our University as President Cole would indicate?
We submit that they are: What is Washington and Lee? Why
has it attained a reputation as one of this country’s outstanding
institutions of higher learning?

We are not known as a school which produces great ath-
letic teams, though we have produced many. Nor are we known
as a great research center, though research is carried on here.
Nor are we known as the outstanding academic school in
America, though our academic program is excellent and getting
better. No, these are not the reason W&L is remembered.

If Washington and Lee has a single virtue, it must be its
ability to produce gentlemen. Gentlemen, not in the trite sense
of “smooth men of the world,’ but gentlemen in the sense of

 

young men who care, care about themselves and society around
them. This is clearly the point that distresses President Cole,
alumni, faculey members and many among the student bedy. |
Our traditions are nothing more than symbols. |

If these symbols should evaporate from the minds of to- |
day’s students, then our University’s maior claim to existence |
may evaporate with them. It probably won’t hurt our academic
program, but it will signal the dominance of apathy which is |
fast becoming our nation’s most feared disease.

Deans See Adjustment in Fraternity Attitudes as Necessary

 

“Fraternities Are An Integral Part...

By JIM AWAD

As students headed back to Lex-
ington weeks ago, they were |
much concerned with the future of |
fraternities on our campus. Rumor |
had it that one of the deans had esti-
mated that only 40 per cent of the
incoming freshmen would pledge in |
1965. After the open houses, most
Greeks felt that the above statistic
was, if anything, optimistic.

Then, as the bitter fight for fresh-
men became even more intense that
last year, convictions became even
stronger. To top it off, with rush
week over and several houses hav-
ing fewer than ten pledges, rumors
began to circulate that a new stu-
dent union would constructed;
and certainly a large, adequate stu- |
dent union would at least not help |
the

But if the situation is examined |
logically, one cannot help but feel
that fraternities are as strong now
as they have ever been. Let’s ex-
amine the controversy at all perti-
nent points.

First of all, 74 per cent of the
freshman class pledged this Septem-
ber. This compares with 75 per cent!

be

fraternities

| in 1964, 73 per cent in 1963, 83 per

cent in 1961, and 76 per cent in 1960.
Obviously, there has been establish-
ed no trend that would indicate an
early demise of fraternities on this
campus. As many people are pledg-
ing now as ever before.

Secondly, there seems to be no
truth in the rumor that freshmen in
the coming years will not be frater-
nity material. True, the freshmen
will be of a higher caliber. Median
College Board scores are higher now
than they have ever been, and the
students seem to be becoming more
serious about scholastics. No one can
deny the fact that W&L is no longer
the “party school” it used to be.

But Dean John has said, all
the fraternities have to do is adjust
to the “changing W&L.” What they
must do is justify their existence
to the new serious-minded fresh-
men. They must realize their re-
sponsibilities in the academic field
as well as in the traditional social
field. This involves guiding the fresh-
man in his studies as well as get-
ting him dates on the weekends.
This is the crucial point, for if fra-

may very well find themselves in
an awkward position in a few years.
Although fraternities are slow to
change, both Dean Farrar and Dean
John are confident that they

stacle.

Thirdly, we must point out that
the Student Union will not interfere
with fraternities in any way. Grant-
ed, a million dollar building, equip-
ped with swimming pool, Saturday
night combos, pool tables, and beer
might persuade a substantial num-
ber of freshmen not to pledge. But
such is not the for no such
building being planned; rather,
plans call for an improvement of
the facilities available to the 20 per
cent of the student body that chose
not to pledge.

ties are an integral part of Wash-
ington and Lee. There is nothing to
take the place of fraternities as to
social functions and lodging on this
campus.”

What we find, then, is the Greeks
are as strong as ever. They must
however, accommodate themselves
to the changing nature of the cam-
pus; they must justify themselves to
the new breed of students. Further-
more, they must prove their utility
to such an extent as to be able to
withstand nationwide criticism of
fraternities—a criticism that has
closed the doors of many chapters
the country over and which, inevit-
ably, will be leveled directly at the
fraternities at W&L. To prove their
utility, they must further the causes
of scholarship, campus and national
activities, psychological guidance, and
athletics—as well as parties.

Pusey Requests Applications for Wilson, Fulbright Awards

 

Competition Opens For Grants

Dean William W. Pusey recently |
called attention to the Woodrow |
Wilson National Fellowships and}
U.S. Government Fulbright-Hays
Scholarships for 1966-67 for which |
academically outstanding Washing- |
ton and Lee seniors can be nomi-|
nated. |

To attract promising young men |
and women to the profession of col- |
lege teaching, the Foundation each |
year awards fellowships to about a|
thousand carefully selected prospec-
tive first year graduate students.

The foundation primarily supports
candidates in the humanities and so-
cial sciences, but in exceptional |
cases, when a clear preference for a
teaching career is demonstrated, can-
didates in mathematics or the natur-
al sciences may also be nominated.

A Fellow receives $2,000 for one
academie year. There is an addition-
al allowance for married men with
children. The Foundation also pays
tuition and fees.

All seniors who are interested in

 

considering a career in college teach-

urged to discuss the fellow-
ships at their earliest convenience
with their major professors and with
Dean Pusey, who is Campus Repre-
sentative for the Woodrow Wilson
Fellowships. The deadline for nomi-
nations is October 31, 1965.

Dr. Pusey stated that 28 Washing-
ton and Lee men have received Wil-
son Fellowships in past years. He
stressed both the prestige connected
with the fellowships and their gener-
ous financial support. In addition to
the recipients of ‘the awards, he
added, many candidates receive hon-
orable mention, which may lead to
assistance from other

ing are

financial
sources.

U.S. Government Scholarships
provided for by the Fulbright-
Hays Act are part of the educational
exchange program of the Depart-
ment of State. Their purpose is to in-
crease mutual understanding be-
tween the people of the United States
and other countries.

Three separate types of grants are

available to United States citizens
holding a bachelor’s degree and pos-
sessing certain language proficiency.

A full grant provides round-trip
transportation, language and orien-

Radio Reflects Asian

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Editor’s note: W&L geology ma-
jors Chip Roadman and Warren
Montgomery are taking a year's
leave-of-absence to work aboard
Columbia University’s oceano-
graphic research ship Vema, The
following report was sent to the
Ring-tum Phi by Montgomery.

R. V. Vema, September 16:
Ever since the Vema_ steamed

westward from Hawaii and into the
oriental Pacific last spring, the
American scientists aboard have been
increasingly aware of the commun-
ist-democratic, East-West conflict
which seems to permeate the Orient.
Here it is the bitter, dogged, some-
times vicious spirit of that conflict
which impresses itself on us, rather
than the sparse details which are
known to anyone who reads the
newspapers or listens to the radio.

It is the radio, in fact, which has
become the principal instrument of
that struggle, the physical manifes-

tation of which is the Vietnam War. |
The Vema’s radio picks up Radio!

Radio Peking

Of these four, Radio Peking is
the most impressive because it is the
most shocking. China’s official Eng-
lish language broadcasts always be-
gins with the International Labor
Hymn and the “news.” The an-
nouncer is almost always a woman,
speaking correct English with a
slight oriental intonation. Those who
have ever heard her broadcasts are
reminded of Tokyo Rose.

China’s version of international
news takes up at least half of the
broadeast time and is repeated mo-
notonously, word for word, all day.
The content of these broadcasts is
startling to anyone who takes Voice
of America as the truth. According
to Peking, the Peoples’ National
Liberation Front of Vietnam (Viet
Cong) is daily winning decisive vic-

tories against the “U.S. Imperial-
ists’ and their “government pup-
pets.” The Los Angeles riot “was no

In addition, Peking usually in-

poems, or inspiring stories. The
hymns are quite beautiful and im-

men and children were singing that,
“...courageous people of South
Vietnam will drive the Yankee Im-
perialist and their corrupt puppets
into the sea; and we will kill them
to the last man; we will impale them
on sticks of bamboo; we will...”

Peking’s “stories” are told in the
vein of a child’s bedtime tale, but

Freshmen Net $87,000 of W&L Financial Aid
As Available Scholarships Balloon 30 Per Cent

Financial aid to members of the
freshman class entering Washington
and Lee University this fall will in-
crease more than 30 per cent over the
1964-65 academic year.

Seventy-six of the 346 freshmen
have been awarded $87,000 from Uni-
versity sources for the coming ses-
sion, according to a report by Lewis
G. John, director of student finan-
cial aid.

The largest number, 56, will par-
ticipate in the University’s grant-
loan program. They receive three-
fourths of their aid during the fresh-
man year in scholarship assistance
and one-fourth in loan help.

Ten of the entering students wil!
be Robert E. Lee Scholars. The in-
creased number of the Lee Scholars
was made possible by the additional
gift to the University of $300,000 by
the anonymous donor who estab-
lished the Scholarship Fund with a
$200,000 gift in 1955. The latest gift
assured continuance of the program
for another 10 years.

Six of the freshmen will be Baker
Scholars, chosen by the University
Board of Trustees’ selection commit-
tee under the $100,000 George F.
Baker Trust, established at 15 liberal
arts colleges in the United States.

Four area boys have been award-
ed Rockbridge County grants, which

 

now pay $1,000 as a reduction in the
University comprehensive tuition
fee.

In addition to these 76 receiving
University aid, there are among the
entering students three National
Merit Scholars, the largest number

to enter the University in any year
since the program was begun, and
16 applicants for aid who presented
outstanding entrance credentials but
had no demonstrated financial need.

65 Football Generals Forecast W

W&L To Meet Randolph-Macon

In Season’s Opener ‘Tomorrow

Last year’s
football team managed a 4-5 record.
At this point in the 1965 season,
the only prediction which can be
made is that the record should be
better this year. How much better
will be determined by how fast sev-
eral sophomores can develop to plug
holes caused by injuries.

The Generals will have their first
chance to show their improvement
when they face Randolph-Macon at
Wilson Field tomorrow. The game
hapes up as a tough one, as the
top-ranked

Yellow Jackets upset
Susquehanna last week

The most outstanding feature about

this year’s team will be a forward
wall that has the three requirements
for excellence: size, speed and ex-

perience. Head Coach McLaughlin
said he felt that these were the boys
who would have to really put out if
the season were to be successful.
Men like Warren Stewart, Logan
Bullit, Charlie Myers, Tersh Baker,
Tom Day, and Jay Bowersox who
average 200 pounds, make the of-
fensive and defensive lines a really
frightening experience for would-be
autumn heroes.

Coach McLaughlin will use the
platoon system. In this way the
boys will have to play only offense
Because lack of depth
and experience weakens the offen-
sive backfield, and two of the three

or defense.

Washington and Lee] promising. Bryant Kendrick, a good

quarterback last year, has develop-
ed into a hard-hitting halfback to
help fill in holes, but the other half-
back spot depends on second-year
man Rudd Smith, an effective, but
relatively inexperienced ballplayer.

Shoring up this starting backfield
is ferocious little Tri-Captain Billy
Andrews, who has had experience
at halfback. Presently, however,
Coach Mac has placed Billy in the
defensive secondary, where his Erich
Barnes type talent will be utilized
iwainst opposing passing attacks.
Still if the starting backfield finds
itself hit by injuries, the Generals
could be in real trouble.

A big line and a backfield with
little depth has left many teams with
losing records. That dilemma should
not arise here. All the coaches feel
the boys are hitting harder than they
were this time last year—a very
good sign. Seniors want to end their
football careers with a winning sea-
son, and the younger boys hope to
flag down their first letter sweater
or restore W&L’s football fortunes

I-M Week

 

Toss-Up Seen In °65 Intramurals

By CHARLIE BENSINGER

Sports Illustrated has, for several
years, teamed with Jimmy “the
. Greek” Snyder and
| other Las Vegas
| oddsmakers in
complete domina-
tion of the field of
sports prognastica-
tion. It is common
knowledge that the
latter holds more
than a slight edge
in correct deci-
sions, but now a
third national in-
stitution arises to
challenge these mighty forces. The
intruder is the Friday R-t P. How-
ever we must admit that we will be
delighted if we accomplish little
more than forcing SI into a few cor-
rect picks and avoiding the laughter
of Las Vegas.

The field of endeavor narrows to
intramural athletics at our hallowed
institution, giving us a thin advant-
age over the present champions. We
would prefer to read the crystal ball
after spending a week observing the
conflict and compiling the lab sched-
ule of all the jocks concerned, but
even the University can’t do the
former and probably doesn’t really
know the latter. Therefore, the fol-
lowing jinxes.

I-M tennis and golf, having opened
Wednesday, present the first prob-
lem, for both this edition and the
fraternity athletic directors. In ten-
nis, League A pits last year’s cham-
pion Phi Ep squad, perhaps in a

 

Bensinger

league of its own, against Sigma
Nu, Kappa Sig, Sigma Chi, and Phi
Kap. with the nod going clearly
to Phi Ep. League B should see

 

ZBT edge SAE, last year’s runner-up
with PiKA, Phi Gam, and Phi Psi |
further behind.
Beta should win League C by de-
feating Lambda Chi, Pi Phi, Phi |
Delt, and DU. KA holds avery nar- |
row edge over the rest of League D,
Delt, NFU, Law, and SPE. As league
play draws to a close, seeding for
the Davis Cup will be announced.
Golf promises to be marked by
closer competition as two leagues
have co-favorites. League A should
see Sigma Nu repeat, with DU, NFU,
and SPE fighting for second. League |
B appears to be a toss-up between |

 

EEOLEEEEEEEEL EEE EE LEEDLEEE LEST DEDEDE DEED ER EEL EEE OLED LEE LEER GEOL ERTIES
oe

+

ZBT and Kappa Si,g, KA, Pi Phi and
Lambda Chi will follow, probably in
some order preordained by the Hill.
Sigma Chi is picked over Delt, Beta,
Phi Psi, and PiKA in League C.

League D will see either Phi Delt
or Phi Gam emerge the winner
over Phi Ep, Law, and Phi Kap.
These choices, however, are not as
clear-cut as are those in the tennis
competition, for as we all know

strange things happen on the Lex-
ington golf (?) course.

Final point standings last year show
the Intercollegiate column headed by
Delt, DU, and SAE. The Intramural
leaders were Phi Kap, SPE, and
ZBT. Overall the top three were
Phi Kap, SAE, and Delt. We are
unequivocal in our statement that we
have absolutely no idea of how this
year’s competition will end.

Now Maj. Walter F. Daniel, test pilot for the YF-12A,
answers your questions about the world’s fastest
manned airplane and America’s Aerospace Team.

 

(Maj. Daniel, a test pilot since 1954, is a member
of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots. He
received a B.S. degree in Aeronautical Engineering
from the University of Oklahoma, In February
1962, he set world class time-to-climb records in a
T-38 jet trainer)

Is the YF-12A the world’s fastest manned aircraft?

It certainly is. On May 1 of this year the YF-12A
(formerly known as the A-11) reclaimed the world
absolute speed record from the USSR. It was
clocked at 2,062 mph over Edwards Air Force Base.

How big is the YF-12A?

The exact dimensions of the YF-12A have not been
released yet. But it's approximately 100 feet long,
with about a © )-foot wingspan. That's half again
as big as our present interceptors!

Is the Air Force training many men
as pilots these days?
Yes, very definitely. In spite of all you hear about
unmanned vehicles, the human pilot is still very
much in the picture. As a matter of fact, the Air
Force pilot quota is on the increase.

What other kinds of jobs does the Air Force offer?
Since it's one of the world’s foremost technological
organizations, the Air Force has plenty of openings
for scientists and engineers. There are also many
challenging and varied administrative-managerial
Positions.
What do I have to do to become
an Air Force officer?

Air Force ROTC is the best way to get started as an

Air Force officer. The new two-year Air Force
ROTC program makes this method available to
men whe have already completed a year or two of
their college education. For college graduates, if
you did not take advantage of ROTC, you can
still get started through Air Force Officer Training
School (OTS), a three-month course open to both
men and women,

Can I keep up my studies while
I'm in the Air Force?

The Air Force encourages its men and women to
continue their educations. For instance, you may
qualify to study for a graduate degree during off-
duty hours, with the Air Force paying a substantial
part of the tuition,

What kind of future do I have in the Alr Force?

A bright one. As we move further into the Aero-
space Age, the Air Force is going to grow even
more important. And you can grow with it!

diers) walking down the road one
day; so arming themselves with
sticks, they hid in the ditch. When
the puppets by, the brave
peasants beat their brains out and
took their rifles, proudly marching
off into the sunset to join the Peo-
ples’ National Liberation Army.”

Radio Moscow’s English language
broadcast, transmitted through Si-
beria, begins with the station’s fun-
ereal theme song and then goes into
the news. The Russian programs are
much more restrained —or subtle—
than those of their Chinese allies.
The news is slanted, of course, but
Radio Moscow avoids the blatant
lies and patent absurdities given out
by Radio Peking. We are still called
imperialists, aggressors, ete. but
without the shrill vindictiveness of
the Chinese. Russian radio entertain-
ment is delightful compared to
China’s—hours and hours of classical

 

music, but no “decadent” jazz or

rock and roll.

Voice of America is comparable to
Radio Moscow; it gives the news
with a western slant. It admits our
reverses in Vietnam, but only when
they are coupled with some measure
of victory or recovery. V.O.A. does
not generally indulge in name call-

ing, though it will refer to the
Vietnamese insurgent forces as
“communist terrorists.” Like Radio

Peking, Voice of America spikes the
news with atrocity stories, though
never so ghastly as the Chinese ones.
V.O.A. also announces with great
relish daily communist mortality
rates, a rather ghoulish practice
which probably does more harm than
good.

American entertainment consists of
music of all sorts, sports broadcasts,
letters to the editor and answers,
and sometimes informative, some-
times dubious programs on Ameri-
can history and government. I heard
one such program the other day

which cited the wars the U.S. has}

fought as proof of America’s tradi-
tion of anti-imperialism. They did
not mention “Manifest Destiny,” or
the Mexican War, strangely enough.

The V.O.A. program concentrates
on science, with emphasis on the
space program. In all, Voice of
America is clearly more interesting
and probably more objective than

its Chinese and Russian counter-
parts.
We Americans aboard the Vema

have seen riots in Tokyo, commun-
ist-breeding slums in Manila, and
America’s ponderous military build-
up on Okinawa. But none of these
have given us such an idea of the
fundamental struggle that exists
here in the East as hearing the radio
broadcasts these people daily hear
and believe.

SW MSFC’s
Present Funds
To University

By DON OTARE

The Student War Memorial Schol-
arship Fund Committee made _ its
annual contribution to the university
yesterday in the form of a check for
$1500, Bernie Harper and Wes Hor-
ner, President and Treasurer of
SWMSFC, presented the check to
Farl S. Mattingly, Treasurer of the
university. It represents the organ-
zation’s money-making efforts of the
1064-65 school year.

SWMSFC was started after World
War II to honor the W&L students
who had given their lives in the
war. The organizations has since
provided the funds for two $400
scholarships yearly. Last year
SWMSFC conducted such projects as
the annual homecomings _ raffle,
‘chool ring sales, and Coke sales
at the university concerts and
dances. They also took charge of
the graduation invitations and caps
and gowns.

This vear, under
of Harper, Horner,
kinsky. the secretary, and Dr. Phil-
lips, the faculty sponsor, SWMSFC
will continue its lucrative endeavors

the leadership

and Gary Bo-

of last year and attempt to find
new and better ideas for raising
funds.

Applications are now being taken,
through Harper and Bokinsky, for
new members from either the soph-
omore or junior class. Ideas for
fund-raising projects will be consid-
ered in the selection of applicants
for membership. The committee will
hold its next meeting on Monday
night at 7:45 p.m., at which time

 

applications will be discussed.

Debaters Hold Meeting;
Ist Tournament Thursday

By FRANK FAIRCHILD, JR.

On Monday, September 20, eighty-
eight students, a record number, re-
ported to Payne Hall for the year’s
first meeting of the debate team. In
outlining plans for the prospective
year, Prof. William W. Chaffin, di-
rector of forensics, commented that
this season promises to be an im-
provement over last year’s highly
successful campaign. He discussed
two practice tournaments which are
to be held here at W&L and listed
upeoming trips for the fall.

Initially, Mr. Chaffin announced
that on Thursday, September 30, a
tournament is slated for experienced
novice debators. In addition, on
Monday, October 4, a novice tourna-
ment is scheduled which will afford

N lee Teouhedous Director Plans

A Diverse Selection Of Plays

A major play from the Theater of
the Absurd, one of Shakespeare's
finest histories, and a slapstick farce
from the Italian Renaissance will be
the offering presented by the Troub-
abours, W&L’s student group, dur-
ing their 1965-66 season.

This schedule, one of the most
varied ever planned by the Troubs,
was announced by newly appointed
director Lee Kahn at the group’s first

meeting of the school year, held
September 19.
The first production, set for No-

vember 17-20, will be Samuel Beck-
ett's Waiting for Godot. Beckett, an
Irishman who lives and works in
France, was one of the pioneers of
the Absurdist school of playwrights,
and Waiting for Godot is his most
popular and most important work
Unlike most plays of this group, it
is distinguished by its humor and by
its real concern for the interest in
humanity.

The Shakespeare play to be pre-
sented is Richard Hl, the story of an
attractive but weak willed king
whose ineffectiveness makes him an
victim to a plot against his
throne. The work has been a [avorite
ever since it was first written, both
with scholars and critics and with

In the addition to describing the
schedule, Kahn also announced
plans for refurbishing and painting
the auditorium of the theater, and
for installing a revolving stage. This
will make possible changes of sets
and theatrical effects which physical
limitations have made difficult until
now. The stage is to be installed in
time for use in Richard I.

Other business transacted at the
meeting included the election of sen-

By PHIL CLAXTON

in the early spring of 1964 a sug-
gestion was made in a regular meet-
: of the Interfraternity
that that body should look into the
possibilities of an intercollegiate con-
ference similar to those held on
other campuses. The suggestion met
with general approval, and Blaine
Brownell was appointed chairman of
project which at that time was
little more than an idea.

in

a

Brownell set up a committee to
consider the program. A name—
CONTACT~—was given to the infant
conference. A theme—The American
Experience—was chosen. And mid-
March was designated as the period
in which CONTACT would be held.

Object of CONTACT

The object of CONTACT was two-
fold. It was established to fill a void
in intellectual life of Washington and
Lee. And it was established in the
hope that such a program would be
of interest to students and stimulate
them into further intellectual pur-
suits.

CONTACT for 1965 was fairly suc-
cessful in achieving its aims. Former
Secretary of State Dean Acheson was
one of the national advisors for the
program. He suggested that the
theme of CONTACT, “The American
Expierence” be broken into three
parts. The domestic scene, the for-
eign scene, and the tying of the two
together were to be covered. This
general outline was followed.

Unfortunately, CONTACT 65 put
too much emphasis on the political
aspects of the “American Experi-
ence.” While the program met its
primary objective, that of bringing
provocative speakers to the campus,
it failed to arouse the interest of the
students. The reason for this failure
was a simple one: CONTACT 65 had
stressed political topics rather than
offering a broad program that would
have been of interest to a majority
of W&L students.

Set for February

CONTACT for 1966 will attempt
to correct the mistakes made in
1965. CONTACT is scheduled for

 

 

photography operations and the |
quality of. the University publica- |

February 11, 12, and 13. This week-
end was chosen in the hope that stu-
dents would be relatively free of
class assignments.

It is hoped that this year’s program
will be more diversified than last
Spring's. Speakers from four or five
separate courses of study will be

Powell Sande Ariel
For Upcoming Year;
Seeks Contributors

The editor and staff of Ariel have
announce plans for the fourth year
of publication of the W&L student
literary magazine,

Editor Grayson Powell, in an or-
ganizational meeting last Wednesday
night, outlined the publication sched-
ule for the autumn issue and set a
deadline of November 8 for submis-
sion of manuscripts for this issue.
The tentative publication date is No-
vember 22, Powell said.

Manuscripts may be submitted at
any time to the editor or to any
member of the staff, or they may be
left in Ariel’s mailbox in the Stu-
dent Union Building.

Powell also announced the follow-
ing policies governing the selection
of manuscripts: “The single most
important criterion in our selection
of material is that it be well written.
It may be on any subject, but it
must conform to generally accepted
principles of literary taste and judg-
ment and must show some degree of
originality and skill.” Any student
at Washington and Lee may submit
manuscripts to Ariel.

Powell specified four types of ma-
terial that are especially preferred:
fiction, in the form of short stories;
poetry; drama and criticism, in the
form of essays and book reviews. “In
case of doubt about a manuscript’s
eligibility for consideration, the au-
thor should contact me before he
submits his work,” advised the edi-
tor.

He further requested that manu-
scripts be typewritten, doublespaced,
and written on only one side of
standard size plain white paper
Authors should submit each manu-
script separately, under an appro-
priate title. “The author's name
should net appear on the manuscript
itself,” Powell said, “because manu-
scripts are judged without regard
to the author's identity
Instead, he should

each manuscript, bearing
the title of his work,

New Election Process Adopted
By E.C. For Freshmen Balloting

Lee’s Proposal
Adopted Last Night
During EG Meeting

In the weekly meeting of
the Executive Committee last
night plans were formulated
for the freshmen elections to

be held the third week of Oc-

tober.

The new election procedure
adopted was presented by Bob Lee,
senior EC representative, in order
to establish a more efficient and
equitable process. Adoption of the
plan by the EC was unanimous.
In essence the plan breaks down
into three major parts. First, any
person wishing to run for either
class office or EC representative
must file a petition of fifty names

with the Executive Committee before
7 p.m., Monday, October 11.

A primary election will be held
for any contest in which there are
three or more candidates. The two
candidates with the most votes
will then run in the general elec-

tion. The primary will be held
Wednesday, October 13, in’ the
Commons from 12 to 7 p.m.

The general election with the two

top candidates running for each of-
fice will be held Monday, Octobe
18 from 12 to 7 p.m. in the Commons.

Petitions can be filed with the E.C
and campaigns begun before Mon-
day, October 11. However, petitions
cannot be filed after October 11.

The freshmen will elect a
president and vice-president in
addition to one representative to the
Executive Committee. This year
freshmen class officers have been
instituted with the idea of giving
their a more significant role
in the conduct of student govern-
ment.

The Executive Committee also
passed a motion which eliminated
all class officers with the excep-
tion of the president, vice-presi-
dent, and E. C. representative, and
three vice presidents in the senior
class.

This modification of
ficer structure

there is a very real possibility that
the E.C. will strengthen the posi-
tion of the class officers by increas-
ing their responsibility in student
government

In other business the E.C. made
plans to interview each of the com-
mittee chairmen in regard to thei:
policies for the coming year. To fa-
cilitate the effectiveness of the com-
mittees a composite of each com-
mittee to include purpose, scope
and membership will be distributed
to members of the freshmen class
and other interested students

Delayed Rush

At the risk of being labelled a ‘Tuesday morning quarter-

 

back” the Tuesday Edition suggests that it is time for a long| ™

and careful appraisal of the fraternity rush system. For the
past four years the percentage of freshmen who do not affiliate
with a fraternity during rush week has steadily increased. The
falling pledge rate is a reality despite a completely revised rush
program which has in effect given the freshmen a great deal of
power and influence.

Our purpose here is not to find the scapegoat for the al-
ready beleaguered fraternity system. What we want to offer for
consideration is the possibility of delayed rush. Quite obviously
we do not presume to have a panacea for all the ills of fraterni-
ties, but the merits of the delayed rush system have become ap-
parent on campuses throughout the nation. Certainly the fra-
ternity situation at Washington and Lee is unique in many re-
spects. This must not, however, provide an excuse for com-
placency in this area.

Why Not W&L?

Washington and Lee is one of the few schools in this coun-
try of any size that continues to use the early rush system. We
can no longer ignore the success which delayed rush enjoys at
small universities with which W&L is often compared. Too
often in the past we have dismissed this proposal with the
statement that it just wouldn’t work here:

We will be the first to admit that there are several obstacles
to the institution of such a procedure, not the least of which
would be the additional financial strain especially in smaller
houses. In addition, a delayed rush would burden image con-
scious houses as well as increase the opportunity for dirty rush.
Some University officials have indicated that the early rush pro-
gram clears up the matter of fraternities first and allows the
freshmen to begin his work without the distractions of rush.
Positive Side

On the positive side there are a number of points which
deserve attention. The financial dilemma of delayed rush is
perhaps the most thorny. One obvious but not so popular
answer would be financial austerity. Delayed rush would also
eliminate the altogether misleading impression of fraternity
life which rush week now fosters. The delayed rush system need
not interrupt a semester for it can conceivably be scheduled
between semesters.

This comment is not meant to embody a workable plan for
delayed rush at Washington and Lee, rather it is intended to
stimulate, and hopefully to elicit serious consideration of this
proposal by every member of the student body and faculty
Fraternities have a responsibility to themselves, but more im-
portantly, they owe the successive freshmen classes a more
candid and realistic presentation of fraternity life.

The purpose of my column this
year will be the same as it was last
year: to amplify and discuss the
subject while serving and I hope in-
teresting you who read it. I am more
or less in the same situation as
you. I am quite interested in movies,
reasonably experienced in them from
seeing them over and over in my
childhood and in talking at great
lengths about them without having
the slightest idea as to how they are
made. I am therefore to be an
amateur among amateurs, rating the
pros.

This fact that we are both ama-
teurs is not a handicap but a credo
or definition. It is an advantage in
the sense that the professionals are
often far too engaged in the prob-
lems of technique, box office, tradi-
tions or the mere physical labor of
putting a picture together to allow
his judgment to perform unblurred.

I may respect Frederic Fellini and
yet detest ninety per cent of 8%
and be able to specify what I detest.
The matter lies in my judgment not
in the fact that I happen to be the
movie columnist for the paper. Were
I a professional, I would so sympa-
thize with the laborious process of
making the movie that I might tend
to be sympathetic a quality which, to
any degree in critics seems excessive.
If we all knew what movies were
all about, we could analyse exactly
what was wrong with a film and
label it as such.

Thus, as amateurs we can recog-
nize our own ignorance and yet feel
no hesitance at expressing our opin-
ions on what we see on the screen
where the proof is caught irrelevant
to excuse and available in propor-
tion to the eye which sees it, and
the mind which uses it.

 

Current Cinema

Role Of Flick Columnist Defined
As Responsible Critic—Enthusiast

 

Job of Critic

What should a good critic do?
Should he be like Shaw and tell
what kind of play should have been
acted instead of the one he just saw.
Should he be like Hazlitt and write
only about acting? Or like Beerbohm
and write about him self.

Most readers want factual reviews.
They want to know the plot, the
characters, is the movie funny or
sad, not good or bad.

Directors usually feel that re-
views affect their movies little if at
all, although destructive criticism
can often spur the director on to new
heights. Few directors though will
be as destroyed by criticism as was
Thomas Hardy after the critics
panned Jude the Obscure.

The responsible critic, however,
should be able to speak to the di-
rector in cinematic terms, despite
what I have said above. There should
be specifies which can be communi-
cated in English, not in any cine-
matic argot, about the movie itself.

In light of this, the critic must
ask himself three questions: 1) What
was the creator trying to do, 2) How
well did he do it? 3) Was it worth
doing? For any critic to be valuable,
he must think both in terms of es-
thetic value and the specific sense
of the film he is reviewing.

The question is one of involve-
ment, of immediacy in the entire
millieu of the film critic. There must
be an excitement about what is now
happening in the movies. If the
critic is not caught up in this, the
point of many movies is quite often
missed and the critic becomes an-
other Bosley Crowther.

Briggs’ Goal
My main goal is to create not only
an informed public opinion, but an

 

 
   
   
  

 

increased public love of motion pic-
tures. The viewer must be conscious
of the film not only as entertain-
ment, but as an exclusive art form.
Here" we must draw a fine line be-
tween appreciation and cultism. By
this I mean that I don’t want to be
a great defender of films who hopes
that one day they will be accepted
as works of art. I mean that films
are the art form of the twentieth
century and they are perhaps the
greatest form of art if art can be
gauged by the degree of effective
involvement it produces in the indi-
vidual. I would never wish to sound
like one who worships the cinema,
but I feel there is a great deal which
can be done to change the attitude
of the public regarding the quality
of motion pictures.

Youth and Movies

The group which most influences
taste is usually the intelligent. In
America today taste is greatly in-
fluenced by youth. On the campuses
today we have these two factors
joined in the student. I am confi-
dent that if more young people re-
quested better movies, better movies
would be made, despite the Holly-
wood involvement in “Box-office.”

This does not mean the critic
should be favorable to good movies
and condemn bad ones. I mean that
the effective critic must be a critic
and propagandist for the cinema as
art and entertainment. He must be
communicable to the public on their
level and the level of the movie-
makers. The critie should stimulate
discussion and spark interest in the
movies so that, in the end, the fal-
lible and controversial final judg-
ments mentioned above will not be
as important and the critic can be-
come truly creative in his own right.

 

By BOB LEE

It is not the purpose of this column
to debate the questions of fraterni-
ties and fraternity life. But since
it must be granted that fraternities
are the pre-eminent institutional
influence on this campus, fraterni-
ty membership has become a prere-
quisite to complete social and extra-
curricular fulfillment. Because of the
gravity of the rushee’s final decision
at the end of rush week, the rush-
ing process must continually undergo
conscientious re-evaluation.

Questions To Face

Part of this critical re-evaluation
consists in weighing both the appar-
ent and obscure advantages and dis-
advantages of fraternity life. For
instance, is the freshman’'s facilitated
assimilation into the traditions of
W&L life worth the sacrifice of his
individual preference? Is his accel-
erated contact with upperclassmen
through his organizational obliga-
tions worth the restrictions this
places on his associations with his
own classmates? Is the fact that the

member's duties was to make sure
his brothers voted straight party.

By MIKE NATION
The upeoming freshman class elec-

tions will inevitably cause the W&L
election system to come under de-
bate again. For the edification of the
freshmen, let's go into a short history
of the conflict.
Old System

At the beginning of last year, the
election system was constitutionally
the same as it is now. However, the
elections were controlled by two po-
litical parties. All the fraternities
belonged to one or the other of the
parties, aligning and realigning
themselves every time the wind
changed direction.

Each party had a clique which
consisted of a representative from
each of the houses within the party,
These two cliques met prior to the
elections and decided who would be
candidates of the party. Needless to
say, the independents had no voice
in the venture.

Clique Nominations

The nominations were usually dis-
tributed to keep all the houses with-
in the individual clique happy and in
line.) Voting usually went straight
down party lines. One of the clique

 

Just prior to the freshman elec-
tions last fall, the minority party
followed the lead of the Sigma Chis,
who had withdrawn from the party
the previous spring, and disbanded
the party. The remaining clique’s
E.C. candidate won, facing badly
splintered opposition.

The remainder of the year was
marked by several attempts to
change the system by amendment of
the student body constitution. All
failed.

Spring Debacle

In the spring elections Fred Min-
del's overwhelming victory over the
one clique’s candidate caused the
elique to recognize the obvious and
disband.

Now we have a system in which
those who want to run for office can
without fear. More important, each
member of the student body has
equal voice in naming his officers
rather than having eighteen young
politicos plotting it all out to suit
their fancy.

Counterproposals

The partyless system, however, has
come under attack, Last spring's

 

class elections were called a “traves-

ty.” No one has bother to explain

how this was, and will be, so. The

student body is still in good shape.
A “Travesty”

One popular counterproposal is that
twe parties be created constitution-
ally. Each would have a “super
clique” consisting of representatives
of every house, the independents and
the law school. Each “super clique”
would then choose the candidates for
the party.

It is not hard to envision that the
same shenanigans prevelant in the
old cliques would again rear their
ugly heads in the name of “the good
of the party.”

Parties Dampen Spirit
"The good of the party” be
damned. The only good that one
muat be concerned with is the good
of the school. Parties and the ensu-
ing loyalty to them enly dilute the
serving of this good,

May all the eager young politicos
on campus vent their wheel-dealing
spirits in the Young Republicans and
in the glorious cause of Ronnie Re-
gan. They are as useful to this
campus as a whistle on a plow.

 

mester worth the possibility of the
disquieting wrong decision? Is the
meal ticket into campus organiza-
tions worth the superficiality and
harrowing disillusionment which fol-
lows any rush week? In short, is
the game worth the candle? Do men
have more to gain or lose by join-
ing a house even before they set
foot in a classroom, and before they
are given the opportunity to ascess
life at Washington and Lee.
Time to Observe

The answer in my opinion must
be a cautiously qualified no; it is
not worth the price. I think that all
of us are in fundamental agreement
that a rush system, if it is to be
found suitable, must provide maxi-
mum opportunity to the freshman in
making this important decision. It
must give him the widest lattitude
possible in comparing all fraernitties,
not merely ten or twelve; that it
must enable him to develop a sni-

cere relationship with the majority
of brothers in a fraternity, not three
or four; that it must give the fresh-
man time to observe the prevailing
attitudes of a fraternity relative to
academic achievement and other im-
portant considerations. Time is the
only means by which these can be
given the proper concern and de-
tachment.

Thus, to me, the fraternity rush
system seems lacking in that the
most valuable commodity in the
making of any decision. For surely
the more time there is given to a
person to make his decision, the
more chance there will be that the
ultimate choice will be correct. Per-
haps were the freshman to be given
his own amount of time to go
through rush and accept a bid when
convenient, within a reasonable
amount of time, he might feel more
at ease during this critical emotional
and academic period, and he might
not be expected to make his final
decision in a frantic and often
drunken frenzy on Wednesday night,
or a soul-searching hour on Thurs-
day. This is but one of the incon-
gruities of our present rush system
which I feel might be made more
efficient by a scrupulous assessment
of one of the University’s most vital
operations.

Opening Assembly;

Discusses Traditions
By BRUCE W. RIDER

Not many days ago I chanced to be
loping about the campus so I decided
to go to take a peek at the ODK
(Old Damned Kaiser) board to notice
the notices.

Pushing my way through 330 eager
freshmen I made it up to the board
and read that the Opening Assembly,
the Festivals of Festivals, was to be
held in Evans Dining Hall (the place
with the fat crest on it.)

Now this may not be a big thing
for you new students or you pro-
gressive types, but for conservative
me it was a Break with Tradition.

No longer would we wend our
way up the lovely steps of the
lovely gymnasium to take our
places in the sweaty hall as gen-
crations had done before us. No
longer would we listen to speeches
given under the basketball net. No
longer would we come to the As-
sembly late so we could sit up-
stairs and play cards on the wrest-
ling mat. Jlere was another tradi-
tion done away with. Woe is us!

To quite honest with you,
friends—and you are my friends—I
felt a little shaky as I rode by skate-
board to the Dining Hall on the ap-
pointed day. (Do you know what
happens if you skip one of the As-
semblies? Aha!)

I usually like to sit in back at such
a meeting, on the theory that if you
sit in back you don’t have to sit up
front.

be

I picked out a comfy metal chair
at the back and sat down (1 had to
leap over a rope somebody was
holding in a vain attempt to get
people to sit up front). Soon after
I had gotten settled the organist
(not the usual record player or
tape recorder) lit into Purcell’s
Trumpet Tune in D and the faculty
lumbered in two by two.

So far everything was new and
different. I was beginning to feel
insecure. But then one of the gentle-
men on the platform came through
for me with the Annual Post Office
Announcement. To us old-timers,
this is a very emotional speech, and I
was heartened to know it was still
the main part of the Opening As-
sembly.

After this fine address another one
was given which showed the fresh-
men that at W&L we face the big
issues of our time. On this campus
we seek to get beyond the mere
surface of things, unlike all those
other places where students are al-
ways marching off to Washington or
debating about Viet Nam or rioting
over freedom of speech.

No, the challenge facing the
young men at Washington and Lee
in 1965 is far greater: Should He
Wear a Tie.

And, seeing that many students
were coatless at the Assembly and.
noting the lack of proper dress and
manners since the Assembly, I would
say that this particular speech went
over like a coat and tie in a punch-
bowl.

Notice

There will be a meeting of the
Independent Union, Thursday, Sep-
tember 30, at 7 pm. in Room 27 of
the Student Union. All independents,
especially freshmen, are urged to at-
tend. The future of the IU and the
independent student in general will
be discussed. Officers will also be
elected.

Freshmen are reminded that
there is a compulsory orientation
assembly tonight at 7 p.m, in Lee
Chapel.

 

Defines Upperclassmen’s Role In Assimilation

By ROY TYLER
Tuesday Columnist

There has been much talk since
the the beginning of rush week that
this freshman class is the best one
to enter Washington and Lee in
many years. What this word “better”
entails, is always, however, never
explained.

The college board averages of this
freshman class were “better.” the
placement test averages of this class
were “better,"and there are even
some “better” basketball players.

To what, however, does being a
“better” class entitle the freshmen?
Does it entitle members of the fresh-
man class to immediately be ac-
cepted as, what some students might
term, “first class students”?

A freshman is a first year student
He knows little ef the customs,
traditions, and way of life of the
university in which he is enrolled
What he learns, he learns from the
upperclassmen

So what? This seems so obvious
that it should go without saying

 

There is a message for all upper-
classmen in this idea... not the usual
one of “... set a good example,” but
make certain that freshmen not only
respect the traditions that have been
strengthened through many decades,
but that freshmen show some respect
to the upperclassmen.

Many would label this “putting a
freshman in his place”; and this,
essentially, is what it involves. It
does not mean that a freshman be
stifled in his creative pursuits. nor
does it mean that he should refrain
from speaking when he has some-
thing to say

It does, however,

mean that he

takes into consideration that this is|
his first year at Washington and Lee, |
is told to do and)

and that what he
what is expected of him is done so
because of a definite reason, He is
told not to walk on the grass, not
becatuse it will destroy the grass, but
because this is an upperclass privi-
lege

When an upperclassman sees a
freshman walking across the grass, ot

walking to the post office without a
coat and tie, it is his responsibility
to inform the freshman that he is
stepping out of line

Perhaps privileges do not belong
in voting, but it has a place in col-
lege life

Privilege is not, however, what all
of this involves. It is more a ques-
tion of respect, both to the Univer-
sity and to each upperclassman,

A child must learn to crawl be-
learns to walk. Assuredly
the child will fall many times before
he can walk. Often he will be hurt.
but there usually is semeone around
to help him up. This is true also of
freshmen. They too make mistakes,
ind it is the responsibility of upper-
clasemen to help the freshman, er
often demand that the mistakes be
corrected

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Carpenter Highlights Game

(Continued from page 3)

The Generals have a partial excuse
in that several key players were
either out with injuries or playing
with ailments. The retirement of
Tommy Sparks also played a major
role in the Generals’ lack of a strong
ground game. One should not be too
harsh on Bryant Kendrick for allow-
ing his man to catch the winning
touchdown pass because Kendrick
was playing with a bad knee and
was a questionable starter a few
hours before game time.

Outstanding Generals

There were a few heartening fac-
tors, though. Bob Barclay, who came
out this year only five days before
the opening game, punted like a
pro until his last two kicks when he
probably became leg weary as they
were his sixth and seventh punts.
The other men in evidence were
guard Tom Day and halfback Mike
Day, who showed flashes of
brilliance last year, was particularly
effective on the trap play and the
sweeps. Tom may be developing into
the best blocking guard in Virginia.

There is a funny story about
Goode. Mike did not join the team
at the beginning of training because
he felt that the weather was too
hot. Mike was not expected to play
too much in the first couple of

games, but injuries to Harry Brook-
by, Kendrick, Billy Andrews, and
Luke Crosland forced him into ac-
tion. As it turned out, Mike was the
outstanding General on the field
Saturday. He returned two kickoffs
for 51 yards and was the star of the
defensive backfield with his many
tackles and solid pass defense. His
second kockoff return almost de-
veloped into a touchdown as the
last man between him and the goal
line managed to knock him out of
bounds.

Smith Surprises

Rudd Smith, sophomore halfback
who was shoved into a starting role
when Brooky was injured, also de-
serves credit for his strong effort.
Although Rudd’s statistics were not
overly impressive, it was evident to
the average fan that he played a

fine game despite his inexperience.
Rudd, whe is also an excellent stu-
dent, could develop into another

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

The Purge

The Executive Committee is to be congratulated for trash-
ing the class offices of secretary, treasurer and historian. These
positions which have for years been useless appendages to our
system of student government once served as compromises
for campus political parties. With their dispersion they signal
an end to any form of clique politics.

It is our hope now that class offices have been pruned of
excess baggage, the Executive Committee will see fit to place
some responsibility in elected class officers, namely the presi-
dent and vice-president, who aside from staging a dance set
once a year, really don’t have much to do either.

In the past the EC has been handicapped in bringing about
needed changes in student government because it lacked the
time to consider alternative courses of action. These officers
provide an excellent area in which to choose men to serve on
study committees for the EC.

In addition, the president and vice-president of each class
may now be encouraged to take over the functions of the hap-
pily now-extinct positions of secretary, historian, and treasurer
of their classes. In the hands of able and willing executives
these offices may earn the attention and regain the importance
which they must originally have been intended to possess when
the class officer system was first put into effect.

Class officers might also provide a basis for more repre-
sentative student government. If definite meetings could be
held for the purpose of considering grievances, ideas or recm-
mendations brought to them by student officers they might find
the revamped program useful.

Opportunity Strikes

Alas, the opportunity strikes.

For the first time in many years this campus has the op-
portunity to build something that other campuses around the
country have had for years. Yes, W&L is in the 20th century.

Under the auspices of Dean Edward C. Atwood Jr. a com-
mittee last week was selected to determine the nature and facil-
ities of a new student union. It will be a new co-op not only
in physical plant, but, it is hoped, a new co-op in viability and
services to the student body as well.

On most campuses, the student co-op offers a place where
students can come for a bite to eat, and not only between
the hours of 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. It offers game rooms and meet-
ing rooms. An adequate book store with reasonable prices is
also a part.

Washington and Lee is essentially a small school immersed
in a fraternity-oriented way of life. However, a co-op provides
much, not only to the 24 per cent of the student body that re-
mains without fraternity affiliation, but to the students as a
whole,

If an extensive and adequate student union is built, it will
not only provide a choice for those students who decide against
joining a fraternity and consequently under present facilities
suffer because of non-existent recreational provisions, but also
supplement the fraternities where they do not provide for the
student. The results will benefit everyone regardless of their
views toward the W&L fraternity system.

We urge that the student union committee push not for
an enlargement of present facilities, nor splitting of the stu-
dent union and co-op, but a new building which could serve
not only independent students and freshmen, but also provides
recreational facilities for all students. After all, isn’t that the
essence of the term?

In short, then, it is our hope that the Student Union Com-
mittee will take note of co-ops on other campuses, and incor-
porate some of their facilities into the plans for ours. This is
opportunity.

“Operation Match” Revolutionizes Dating
For Knaves, Drunks and Inexpert Lovers

By DAVE MARCHESE

Gentlemen, and this is primarily
directed to the Washington and Lee
gentlemen who in the past have been
grossly confused for U.Va. slobs as
well as being editorially slandered
as knaves, drunks and inexperienced
lovers. Well, ah, gentlemen if this
be the nasty truth, and you find
your supply of dates dwindling or
already “consumed” don’t sweat it
the jocks say, “There is yet a
glimmer of hope. Actually, I speak
with a tongue somewhat forked up.
Granted, since the social

still gamboling through the woods

W&L Gentlemen spread.

So why not get them before they

self, Marchese, we're doing just that;
we're going down the road and get-

elixir of your social life does exist.

t's called “Operation Match.” As
the name indicates, this program is
designed to match you with the
girls of your choice. I'd like to em-
phasize the phrase “your choice.”
This program, the brain-child of
several mixer-weary,  blind-date
frustrated Harvard students is a
computer matching project which
matches you according to your vital
statistics, qualifications and prefer-
ences to a number of girls of mutual
tastes, interests and desires! How
does it work? That's easy to explain.
Next week the regional directors of
operation match will attempt to can-
vass directly and indirectly the en-
tire student body. For the adven-
turous sum of three dollars you can
experience the exotic and erotic re-
wards of operation match. After an-

Columnist Writes From His Heart

Let's Not ‘Baby’ Freshmen,

By JIM AWAD

For the past few years a contro-
versy has been flaring as to the value
and future of the traditions that go
hand and hand with Washington and
Lee.

Any intelligent observer can see
that the proponents of both sides of
the controversy have worthwhile
points to expound. But there ap-
peared an article in last Tuesday's
Ring-tum Phi which totally destroys
one’s faith in the intelligence and
integrity of those who favor the
status quo, For reasons of tact, the
name of the columnist shall not be
mentioned; but it is essential that
the article be answered.

Granted, a freshman is a first-year
student, but that has no bearing on
his ability to evaluate the society of
which he is a part. He is not a child
learning to walk, and he need not
necessarily stumble. Rather, he is a
fully grown adult who has just
walked into a new society. If I were
a freshman, I would be more than
insulted at being compared to an in-
fant. Anyway, the point to be
brought out, and the assumption

CANNON

“Well, Vd say it's been a rather profitable Rush Week.”

 

' appropriate

upon which we must work, is that
a freshman is a fully grown human
with full ability to examine and eval-
uate,

Secondly, we must note that the
freshman is not unaware of our cus-
toms, traditions, and way of life. It
would seem, in fact, that the fresh-
man is well-versed on the tradi-
tions and customs of Wé&L, as a
good part of freshman camp and the
Tuesday evening orientation sessions
are devoted specifically to educating
the freshman regarding these very
things. Also, we might note that the
freshman can see and perceive—and
he has been seeing and perceiving
for four weeks now. By now, he
must know what is going on and
be aware of our so-called “Way of
Life.”

Armed with the fact that fresh-
man has the ability to perceive and
to conduct himself as any other

adult and with the fact that he is|

aware of W&lL, in all its aspects, we
can move on to the major hypothesis
of this article: that the freshman
need not necessarily accept what he
sees. If he is pleased with what he
does see, fine; if he is not he is free
to express his displeasure and to
work for modification of what he
does not like. He need not necessar-

| ily accept conventional dress and the

speaking tradition, and he may em-
ploy any means that he himself fels
to execute the modifi-
cation he is seeking

Let this fact be remembered and
let no one attempt to impose his
views concerning W&L traditions on
the first year men. This columnist, as

an opponent of conventional dress

man a “baby” and telling him he'd
better speak out against the tradi-
tions or else, And, on the same basis
is hoped that those who favor
conventional dress and its ramifica-
tions will never again use this o
jany other media in an attempt to
impose his views on the freshman by
telling him he is a child and had
better listen

been under inspection. A substan-
tial element rejects them and is seek-
ing their modification; therefore, we
are not even sure that these cus-
toms will survive this academic year.
How the hell, then, can we tell the
freshmen that there are rigid laws
which they must obey—whether
they approve or not? The freshman
himself will be instrumental in de-
ciding the outcome of the conflict.

The rate of assimilation, then, de-
pends upon the individual. If one
upperclassman accepts conventional
dress, he must, according to his con-
science, assimilate a violator of the
tradition. If, on the other hand, an
upperclassman is among those who
reject conventional dres, then he, ac-
cording to his conscience, has no ob-
ligation to assimilate a freshman.

As to a freshman, if he accepts
conventional dress and is assimilated,
then he is obligated to live up to the
beliefs he expresses. Again, though,
if a freshman doesn't accept conven-
tional dress and is assimilated, then
he must do what he considers to be
right and must advoeate modifieation
As for a freshman doing the assimi-
lating, the same concept that applies
to upperclassmen applies to him

Tyler stated that
however, what all
of this involves. It is more a ques-
tion of respect, both to the Univer-
sity and to each upperclassman.”
Most important of all is Mr. Tyler's
belief that upperclassmen “make cer-
tain that... freshmen show some re-
spect to the upperclassmen, ”

I beg to differ with Mr. Tyler on
this point. In my opinion, respect
is always earned. Never it is pro-
duced through demands, regardless
of the position held by the individual
or group demanding it. Indeed, the
inevitable results of such demands,
if they exerted strongly, are
contempt and fear on the part of
the individual group at which they
are aimed.

I prefer to believe that an upper-
classman’s life at Washington and
Lee is made fruitful and enjoyable
through friendly cooperation with
his fellow students and his profes-
sors. We are supposedly gentlemen,
and I should like to point out to Mr.
Tyler that a gentleman does not de-
mand respect, but instead merits it
by dint of his gentlemanly traits.
Gentlemen teach others by example,
not by verbal exhortations. In fact,
1 gentleman should net even trouble
himself with such a matter, for to
prompt foreibly an air of deference
is an act unbecoming a gentleman,
and more befitting a bully.

Varsity Squad Plays
R-M Booters Toda

Hoping for good weather, the
Washington and Lee varsity soccer
team will take the field against
Randolph-Macon today at 3:15 p.m.
The Yellow Jackets will be out for
revenge for the two losses suffered
at the hands of W&L last year.

Coach Joe Lyles revealed that
Randolph-Macon will be improved
last year. “They are getting
better and better, as they get more
boys from the East. They also have
a fine coach, ‘Mutt’ Werner, and we
expect a tremendous hustle and a
sharp passing game from them.”

This will be the home opener for
the Generals, who enter the game
with a 2-1 season, and the first game
of the season for Randolph-Macon.
Lyles commented that the Yellow
Jackets, like Lynchburg College, em-
ploy a short passing attack along

Dear Mom...

Dear Mom and Dad (my parents get
upset when I don’t write, but they
do have a subscription),

 

As a result of an overbundance of
ads and a desire to avoid competition
with the New York Times, last
week's R-t P was cut, even our fav-
orite column. From the depths of the
circular file comes a revision of our
advocation of student support of the
football and soccer teams.

By support we mean encourage-
ment beyond the bedroom statement
to your date that
you hope the team

beats Jerkwater
(Oct. 30), or who-
ever they play.

Moreover, just
once don’t use the
drinking regula-
tions as an excuse
for your absence.

To be _ sure,
there is no booz-
ing permitted at
the games, but
why not simply pull an end run by
arriving There is
ample time betwen classes and the
kick-off to soak up both spirits and
spirit. If then you can still walk or
fly the “longest concrete
footbridge in the world,” try it (for
years we've wondered, is there

with a “Y” formation. Lynchburg
will be a W&I foe later this year.

With rain predicted for this after-
noon, Lyles expressed a hope that
good weather would prevail. “Since
both schools rely upon a passing at-

tack and try to control the ball as
much as possible good weather will
make for a better game on both
sides,” he said.

After splitting their first two
games, the Generals have shown

good potentio! along with outstand-
ing performances. Lyles cited Tim! 9
Henry, who leads the squad in scor-
ing with with
Fred Skinner, who scored the only
goal in a 1-0 victory over Belmont
Abbey of North Carolina. He
singled out freshman Scott Fechnay
and Fred Fletcher for praise in theit
first inter-collegiate games.

Despite the fact the W&L

championship team, the coach refus-
es to characterize this as a year for
rebuilding. “Although we lost some
boys last year, we’re going to lose
just as many at the end of this year.
If anything, next year will be a re-
building year for us.”

Having started practice Monday,
September 6, the freshman football |
team has progressed to the point
where Coaches Swan and Payne feel |
extremely happy with their charges’
advancement. They've managed to
overcome the intricacies of the
Washington and Lee go-T formation,
a very tough offense which is es-
| pecially hard for inexperienced play-
| ers to master. The team is composed
lof men with outstanding back-
grounds and promising potential, and
with the increased tempo of last
week’s practices the abilities of the
players have begun to materialize.

 

Lyles expressed hope for the sea-
son by saying, “Even with our in-
experienced boys just up from the
freshmen on the squad, we expect a
good year. This is a good group and
they won't be disappointing.”

The test will come Saturday when
the squad travels to Woodberry For-
est for the first of a tough six game
schedule. Coaches Swan and Payne
feel that the squad is emotionally
ready and that the upcoming con-
test will provide the action the play-
ers need.

Last weekend Woodberry Forest
defeated a strong Collegiate School
of Richmond team 21-6, and appear-
ed quite impressive in their victory.
Their boys have played together for
several years and should be well
versed in Woodberry’s pro-type of-
fense. Washington and Lee has been
working on a defense, however, that
they feel can stop the Woodberry
attack. If our own attack can jell
against the tough Forester defense,
which has allowed us but one touch-
down in the last four years, W&L
should pose a considerable threat to
the Woodberry squad.

Next Friday the team returns home

for an encounter with Fishburne
Military School. All students and

faculty are encouraged to attend and
boost this fine young club, which
promises to be one of the best fresh-
man squads in the last several years
of Washington and Lee history.

Generals Plan Defeat
For Hampden-Sydney

By ANDY LUPTON
The Generals travel to Hampden-
Sydney this weekend for a game

‘|! which ought to put in sharper pers-

pective 1965's football fortunes.
Last week we picked Washington
and Lee over Randolph-Macon and
were proved wrong. However, the
brand of football played in the
opener was better than during most

‘|of last season, Consequently, W&L
.|should pull together as a team and

edge Hampden-Sydney on Saturday
afternoon.

Frosh Soccer Team
Displays Impressive Talent
In Win Over A. M. A,

The frosh soccer team, under the
direction of Bruce Jackson, opened
their nine-game schedule against
Military Academy with a _ rousing
4-0 triumph. Playing at Augusta in
Staunton, the first-year eleven com-
pletely dominated the action, con-
tinually driving at the opponent's
goal. They finally penetrated the net
in the first, second, and fourth quar-
ters as Jack Smith, Joe Horowitz,
and Hank Grady rammed home
goals. Smith, scoring twice, shone
particularly. A fine defense consist-
ing of Mike Hirsh, John Simmons,
and John Burt along with goalies
Grey Hesson and Mark Faverman

foiled A.M.A.’s futile attempts to
score.
Now that Coach Jackson has a

workable nucleus, the team ought
to show even more improvement,
characterized by sharper passing
and deft footwook. Jackson, a first
year law student at W&L, was a
standout member of last year’s var-
sity and received all-state honors
three years in a row.

Jack Smith and Brook Hines were
elected co-captains for the coming
season.

The freshmen play their next game
against the Lynchburg College junio:
varsity on Thursday, October 7 at
Lynchburg.

Better Things lor Better Living
through hemiatry

This season’s schedule doesn’t fea-
ture any pushovers, yet even if it
| did, H-S could not considered
one of them. In their opening game
they were whipped by a really good
Guilford team, 28-3. Last weekend
Hampden-Sydney trailed Bridge-

be

water 7-0 at the half, but came back
to win 14-7 with some excellent
football in the second half. The

Tigers have two dangerous backs in
Lipscomb and Tysinger that any
college team in Virginia would be
glad to list on its roster. Thus Wash-
ington and Lee’s defensive unit faces
a severe test. Still, the defense did
a yeoman’s job last week and prom-
ises to improve against Hampden-
Sydney.

W&L offense though presents a
bigger problem. Randolph-Macon ar-
rived here with a really fine defense,
equally adept at handing a ground or
passing attack. We were simply
throttled. The Generals experienced
difficulty with interior line blocking
last wek. Hopefully a week of work
will show some improvement. A few
properly thrown blocks could dispel
fears of offensive impotency.

The Macon game was the season's
first so obviously mistakes were ex-
pected. Yet, a good group of sopho-
mores capitalized on actual game ex-
pierence. If the Generals can hold
Tysinger, they'll hold Hampden-
Sydney. So here’s stretching that
limb a little further... W&L by a
touchdown, probably 14-7.

In last years’ game between the
two squads, the Generals came off
on the short end of a 21-0 score.
The Generals haven't beaten Hamp-
den-Sydney since 1962.

Henry E. Coleman,

recent

 

The collection was bequeathed to
Washington and Lee under the will
of an alumnus, the late Carter N.
Bealer of Washington, D.C. Mr.
Bealer, a graduate of the class of
1922, was an editorial writer for the
Department of Agriculture. Accord-
ing to Mr. Coleman, his library was
remarkable for the variety of inter-
ests represented as well as for the
thoroughness with which they were
covered,

Among the subjects in which Mr.
Bealer was particularly interests
were cats, boating and the sea, and
nature. The collection also contains
many volumes on painting tech-
|niques and several books of limer-
icks.

Also included is a large number
of works on the theater, many of
which McCormick Library has not
possessed until now. These, together
with Mr. Bealer’s outstanding col-
lection of theater programs, will be
|made available to the students in
| the History of the Theater course.

The books will appear on the regu-
‘lar library shelves as they are cata-
|logued, Mr. Coleman said. He em-
| phasized that his staff had barely
| had time to scratch the surface, say-
| ing that he was not really sure what
they would find, but that in any case,
|Mr. Bealer’s bequest was a major
| addition to the library's resources.

eight films on the W&L campus this
semester.

Every other week on Friday eve-
ning in du Pont auditorium the film
society gives two performances of a
classic movie. The extra perfor-
mance insures that all season ticket
holders will have a chance to see
the film.

The season ticket is the only means
of admittance to the performance,
and today is the last day these will
be available. Price of a season tick-
et is $5.00; the ticket also entitles
its holder to bring a date for an ad-
ditional 50 cents for each show. Mar-
golies and Mr. Jennings also plan

to give reduced rates for next se-

Notice

Any student who failed to receive
a Troubadour Theatre season ticket
during registration may pick one
up at the theatre during the next
week.

lifty-five Enter
Deferred Rush As
IFC Defines Rules

By BILL WILKERSON

This week begins the semester-long
Deferred Rush period. Aabout fifty-
five freshmen attended a half-hour
meeting last Thursday night at which
details of Deferred Rush were dis-
cussed by IFC representatives.

At the meeting Chuck Griffin, IFC
President, emphasized the import-
ance of the freshmen to pay particu-
lar attention to the houses from
which they received bids. Sixteen
of the freshmen in Deferred Rush
received bids.

Freshmen who have not received
bids are generally hopeful that the
length of deferred rush will enable
the fraternities to look more careful-
ly at them. The freshmen who have
received bids hope to be able to see
behind the Rush Week fronts.

Rules in Effect

Although Deferred Rush is much
more informal than Rush Week,
Chuck Griffin said, “Such things as
dirty rush can still take place dur-
ing Deferred Rush, and rules per-
taining to this type of thing are still
in effect.”

Depledging well pledging
takes place during Deferred Rush
When a depledge occurs, the frater-
nity reports to the IFC. The fresh-
man enters a non-contract period of
two weks after which he is eligible
to visit and join another house.

In addition to Chuck Griffin, John
Burke, IFC Rush Chairman, Geoff
Butler, Jody Luck and Barry
Vaught, members of the Judicial
Council, were present at the Defer-

THE RING-TUM PHI

Tuesday Edition

 

A Practical Approach

Even the casual observer of this year’s freshman class is
struck by the almost universal disregard of the name tag con-
vention. Although this is only the second year of this “‘tradi-
tion,” it is apparent that the system is not functioning properly.
Despite efforts of the IFC and the Assimilation Committee
to provide replacements and a certain amount of moral sausion
the system has failed miserably.

Return to the Beanie

In view of this deteriorating situation we suggest a return
to the more characteristic mode of freshman assimilation—
the beanie. Admittedly, the beanie is not the most attractive
or dignifying item one might wear, but it serves one very real
function and does so effectively. It easily identifies the fresh-
man and at the same time promotes a degree of cohesiveness
within the class.

The name tag, however noble in theory, is nonetheless
highly impractical in reality. Freshmen are constantly loosing
or inadvertently destroying these flimsy appendages making
replacement a full time operation. The beanie is certainly more
durable, and if we can draw on past experience, the instance
of loss is not nearly so great.

A Semblance of Respect

Quite apart from the merits of either the name tag or beanie
convention, it should be obvious to all that the assimilation of
freshmen in the last few years has left a lot to be desired. In
order to restore some semblance of respect for the waning
traditions of conventional dress and speaking, a new approach
to freshman orientation must be undertaken.

It is our opinion that the name tag convention is im-
practical and does not enjoy the respect of a large number of
freshmen. A return to the beanie may provide an atmosphere
of respect for our traditions, which is so sadly lacking at this
time.

The University Book Store

“There is nothing new under the Sun”
—Ecclesiastes

 

A perennial campus complaint which receives great at-
tention and little action every year is that of the University
book store. The complaints range from the impoverished fresh-
man who feels he has been taken to the cleaners to the out-
raged upperclassman who—already reconciled to the high
prices—is further tripped up by the unreasonable hours which
the store is open. Any of these complaints have merit.

Bad Business

We have no way of knowing whether the inflated book
prices are unnecessary, but we can make an informed judgment
on the necessity of closing the book store at 4:30 p.m. This
early closing is not only inconvenient; it is bad business and
thoroughly anti-commercial. The store manages to close just
as most students are getting out of labs, and those who run it
will respond neither to passionate pleas nor tappings on the
window. After 4:30 p.m., you can forget it.

A Competitive Co-op
The Book Shop on Washington Street remains open some
nights until 6:00 p.m., as does the newly-opened Old Dominion
Stationery store. We see no reason why the University book
store cannot become, if not competitive, then at least business-
like. The Ring-tum Phi urges the hours of the book store be
expanded, and soon.

its impossible to do so. Their first

Lee Examines Role Of Critic

 

Reciprocal Concept of Responsibility
Viewed As Fundamental In Our Society

By BOB LEE

Today, we are more prone than in
any former time to ponder the re-
lationship of the individual vis-a-
vis the society of which he is a mem-~
ber. This relationship, we are re-
minded, is predicated on the principle
of reciprocal responsibility. This is,
the community ean make available
to the individual certain benefits
which the individual could not con-
ceivably realize apart from society.
But the individual too must assume
certain responsibilities which com-
plement those of society—the respon-
sibility of seeing that those benefits
are offered to all members of the
community, and not deliberately or
capriciously denied some—that the
very system is “impregnated” with a
sense of justice and purpose.

Washington and Lee is in many
respects a microcosm of the “great-
er society” into which we will be
eventually thrust. If it is to survive,
it must function on the same prin-
ciples as those of society. In short,
it can offer the student the promise
of intellectual and social fulfillment.
But do not these benefits imply the
right of the institution to make de-
mands upon he individual; and if
this is true, as I believe it is, what
is to be the nature of such demands?

Nature of Demands

Concisely, it is the obligation of
the student to “applaud” when the
community fulfills its responsibilities
and seeks to expand the scope of its
enterprise. But should the community
become delinquent in the perfor-
mance of its duties, it becomes in-
cumbent upon the student to criti-

 

cize, exhort, and reprove. Thus the
role of the student becomes that of
a participant—to insure that neither
party defaults in the performance
of their responsibilities, to condemn
the student who seeks to wrest from
community all he ean without con-
tributing anything of himself and to
reprehend the community which
suppresses the individual initiative
and talent of its members. In either
instance, such selfish pursuit leaves
only a void, a vacuum in which
neither the individual nor society
can prosper,

The student need not be a eynie,
but he must remain an interested and
critical observer. He must not aban-
don that cause which he believes to
be just simply because the source
of his anxiety—he is teld—is time-
honored, tmie-cherished tradition. It
is noteworthy to remind oneself that
“no tradition can survive in oppo-
sition to the eonsensus of contem-
porary thought and feeling.” The
majority of men are disposed to up-
hold what they conceive to be just,
and if a tradition or convention is
founded on the principles of justice,
its claim to posterity cannot be de-
nied. Those “ideals” which served
our predecessors at Washington and
Lee so admirably may not provide
the correctives necessary today, and
to defend them SOLELY on the
basis of their past value is to di-
minish any present value. Change
should not be advocated for change’s
sake, nor should change be spurned
when the need of reform manifests
itself to the dictates of reason.

 

 

 

Problems Of Distressed Freshmen

By Advice Of Ominscient Upperclassman

By BRUCE RIDER

As I was pushing my powerful
Honda down Main Street the other
afternoon, I came
upon a freshman
who was sitting on
the curb looking
very sad indeed.
™ “Hello, lad,”
_ said 1, Speaking
First because I am
an upholder of
| great and magni-
ficent _ traditions.
“why so pale and
wan?”
“Oh, Sir,” said
he, “I am in the deepest distress, for
I have lost my little name tag and
now nobody will know I am a fresh-
man.”

“Nonsense, my boy.” retorted L
“Anyone could tell at a glance that
you are but a freshman, name tag
or noe.”

“Really, Sir?”

“Quite. Here, if you will be so
kind as to push my Honda I will
walk along beside you and explain

 

how can one tell
whether a man is a sophomore, a
junior, or whatever else there can
be.”

“You are most kind, Sir.”

“We have but one rule, my son—
and damn if I can remember what
it is. In any event. it is my pleasure
to further your education.”

I will new relate to you gentle
reader, the substance of my conver-
sation with this particular freshman.
(1 must admit that I was startled
when he told me he was born in
1948. Man, I remember 1948. But, on
with the tale).

First, of course, we have the
Freshman. He dresses a bit shabbily,
mostly because his parents are mak-
ing him wear out his high school
clothes before buying him new ones.
Hence the white sock, the too-short
trousers, and the nasty thin little
ties. He usually travels by foot, since
he is not allowed to have a ear this
first year. Beneath his seemingly
self-confident look there beats a
heart of fear: he does net know the
what the future has in store for him.

at a glance

Let us not be tempted to deny the
legitimacy of complaint. There can-
not be a single sphere of our lives at
Washington and Lee which should
be arbitrarily exempted as unsuitable
for debate. The greater the influence
a particular institution, tradition or
convention has on our lives, the more
imperative it becomes that its value
is questioned. To argue, for instance,
that those who oppose conventional
dress are without cause is to plead
ignorance. The value of such a con-
vention can be determined only after
seriously weighing both its advan-
tages and disadvantages.. No useful
purpose can be accomplished by ig-
noring the merits of an opposing
viewpoint, as no useful purpose can
be served by blatant disregard or
contravention of established pro-
cedure, justly derived. Such behav-
ior reveals only a root discontent for

one’s own ideals and nullify the
opportunities of free expression. The
right to criticize presupposes a re-
sponsibility which the critic must not
ignore. There are accepted avenues
of protest, and there are those which
shall always, I hope, remain unae-
ceptable.

It is now time for the whole stu-
dent body to get out of the grand-
stand and get onto the playing field.

Delayed Rush

Less Strenuous

To those of us who are freshmen,
there is a great deal of confusion
surrounding rush week which has
still to be worked out. The objective
of the whole program with different
to aequaint students with different
fraternities, but I can hardly see
how a long series of short visits to
houses where everybody looks like
everybody else, is the ultimate solu-
tion. All the smiles, free eats, spark-
ling rooms, and glowing hospitality
are hardly typical of a fraternity
once rush week is over.

For this reason, it seems that de-
layed rush offers a much more real-
istic look at fraternities. First, you
get a chance to find out what the
house is really like. Then you have
a longer period to watch the house
activilies and participation in campus
life. The atmosphere during deferred
rush is less strenuous and clears
away many of the barriers to a
sensible, unemotional decision by

'the potential pledge.

It is not unreasonable to think
that in the future more and more
students will choose to participate
in deferred rush. Even this year
a number of men who were offered
several bids chose to delay their de-
cisions until they could get at the

truth of the fraternity situation.

Ruffin Ponders Seniors

” Fate;

Undecided Set for Law School

By NICK RUFFIN

The scene is a conversation be-
tween two W&L seniors.

“Joe, what are you going to do
after you get out of this place?”

“This girl at Hollins is after me
to marry her, and her old man would
give me a job; but I don’t think it's
worth it. I don’t know what I want
to do; | guess I'll go to law school.”

The Uncommitted

Not long ago a student who did not
know what he wanted to do would
often go into the Army. Those who
were more fortunate would go to
school in Europe to absorb culture.
The Vietnam situation made mili-
tary service even less desirable than
it was before the hot, cold War, so
a new out was discovered.

The uncommitted at W&L are go-
ing to law school. These prospective
law students can not be character-
ized by major or fraternity. They
appear to knew little about law
school fer the practice of law.
While a few are dedicated to be-
coming lawyers most are united by
a lack of direction and a surprising
naivete.

A Love of the Law?
Realizing that seven years in the
town of Lexington can cause dis«
turbing deterioration of one's senses,
most W&L seniors choose to pursue
their legal training elsewhere. A few
who find the road trips and the ex-'|

 

citement of campus polities alluring
choose to remain here.

Professors and practicing lawyers
say that a law student must be dedi-
cated to succeed in law school. He
must have more than a casual in-
terest; he must love the law. To
those who are going to law school
to find themselves, I say “good luck.”

Dream of Success

With the multitude of career op-
portunities available it is surprising
that so many studenis stumble inte
law school. Many of the prospective
lawyers have done well in their ma-
jors, and would presumably be
headed for a career in some way re-
lated to their study here. Another
remarkable feature of the prospective
student at W&L is his dream of
material success achieved through
law. It is the desire for wealth rather
than an interest in law that inspires
many students. The big Mustang
in the sky beckons. I am not against
wealth, and I do not claim that law-
vers interested in material success
will fail: but graduation from law
school does not guarantee one a
house in the suburbs. The average
lawyer is not a wealthy man: he
eould probably draw more income
driving a truck. (1 ignore the loss of
stills.)

At the present time there is a glut
of lawyers in the major cities of the

With the final quarter waning rap-

Finally, with 1:04 left in the game

Student Attacks Footballers;
Passing Game, Spirit Hit

Washington and Lee football this
year has the potential of having one
of the finest teams in the area. It
has respectable size and experience
on the line and, despite a lack of
speed, a tough, agile set of backs.
Most of the players have been work-
ing together for more than full
season and there is little reason that
they should not win. But they
haven't. They have been shut out
in both their first two encounters.
They have been beaten by good
teams, but they need not have lost.
There are two reasons for their
problems; lack of spirit and inade-
quate passing attack.

a

If a football team is to function
properly, it members must be “up”
for the game. They must be ready
not only physically but mentally.
If a team does not really want a
ball game, its chances of getting it
are slim. At the beginning of prac-
tice this fall few members of the
team thought that attitude would
be a major problem. But, attitude
has been a key difficulty so far this
season.

In the opening game, W&L out-
played Randolph-Macon for a quar-
ter and half but was unable to

period they lost their spunk, and
the game belonged to the Yellow
Jackets from then on. The loss seem-
ed to stun the Generals because they
didn’t come to play at Hampden-
Sydney. The first half was marred
by lack of desire and lack of hitting
by Washington and Lee.

The second half was diflerent,
however, as W&L began to play
as if they meant it. And they
played well. The Generals showed
in the first part of the R-MC game
and the second half of the H-SC
game that they are capable of good.
solid football. Centre College pre-
sents an excellent oppertunity for
the Generals to prove to the school
and te themselves that they can
out-hit, out-want, and out-score
a team for a full sixty minutes.

The passing attack presents a more
tangible aspect of the Washington
and Lee woe this fall. W&L foot-
ball has never been of the razzle-
dazzle type seen at other schools
They must feel that the ground
game is the safest, surest method of
moving the football. The Generals
passed quite a bit last year but even

then, did not do so wisely. In the

Appoints Five New Officers

 

CONTACT Committee Selected

By MIKE BARK

Under the co-chairmanship of Phil

Claxton, Kappa Sig junior, and
Roger Sennott, a senior, Contact will
hold its second annual series of

lectures and speeches on February
11, 12 and 13. The Contact program
was instituted last year under the
auspices of the  Interfraternity
Council. It was conceived to fill an
intellectual void and arouse student
interest.

Several students have been ap-
pointed to positions in Contact. Nick
Ruffin, an independent senior will |
be a special assistant. Bruce Kramer,

 

Foreign Gervies Officer Speaks :

a ZBT senior, will be in charge of
registration. Chris Miller, a Phi Ep
sophomore, will be secretary of the
organization. Jody Luck, of Pi Kap-
pa Phi, is the IFC representative as
well as social chairman. Jody Kline,
a Phi Kap sophomore, is to be pro-
gram co-ordinator,

There are still two positions left
open. Claxton furthered, “We are
still looking for a treasurer. His job
will be very demanding as he has
to help us raise funds.” A publicity
chairman is also needed. It is prefer-
red that juniors or seniors apply for
these positions. There are other jobs

 

 

To Students On Training, Duties

Daniel H. Clare, UI, of the US. |
State Department spoke to W&L |
juniors and seniors in duPont Hall, |
Thursday, October 7 at 2 p.m. on the
subject of the United States Foreign |
Service.

Mr. Clare, who just returned from
Ecuador on home leave, first showed
a film entitled “The Unending Strug-
gle.” which shows the activity of
Foreign Service Officers during “one
day in one nation.” He then spent
some time in a general question-and-
answer session, after which he in-
vited individual questions.

The film designed to show what
F'SO's do in the field, was a series
of scenes, all unstaged and live,
showing different FSO’s in Eeuador,
from the then ambassador, Maurice
Bernbaum, now ambasador to Ven-
ezuela, through the United States
Information Service Chief, the Con-
sul, the Chief of the Political Section,
the Labor Attache down to the
Army. Each was shown periorming
one phase of his job: canvassing stu-
dent opinions, selling US.LS. radio

Two hundred and fifty applicants are
expected to pass, and 200 to be taken

After acceptance, the trainee goes
through two months orientation and
then language training. Mr. Clare
explained that the basic training is

Faculty Advisors

The faculty advisors for this year’s
program will be Dr. Edward Pinney
of the Political Science Department,
Dr. Archie Robertson of Law, Dr.
John Gunn of Economies, Dr. Louis
Hodges of Religion and Dr. Charles
Turner of the History Department.

The program will be entitled “The
American Experience.” This will also
be the topic of debate every year.
Last year the speeches concerned the
United States on the domestic scene
and the role it plays in world affairs.
Among the speakers were a CIA
representative and Dr. Silver, author
of Mississippi: Closed Society. The
latter's spech “packed Lee Chapel,”
according to Phil Claxton, “as the
students wanted to hear this man
who is so well known for his criti-
cisms of the South.”

This year the organization of the
program will be improved. Claxton
stated that “there will be four to
six categories from which the stu-
dent will be able to choose. For those
who are really interested in a par-
ticular topic, seminars limited in
number to 25 will be held. The stu-
dents will have to read books by
the lecturer before they attend these
seminars.”

Circle K Projects Include

The faculty has recommend-
ed three seniors as representa-
tives of Washington and Lee
in the competition for Rhodes

Scholarships this year: Joe

Miller, Fred Mindel, and Bill
Washburn.

Miller, captain of the varsity foot-
ball team, Dean’s List, and president
of Fancy Dress, will apply in his
home state of Tennessee. If he is
successful in the competition. he will
“read” history at Oxford University
next year.

Mindel, president of the Student
Body, and a major in English, will
apply from Virginia rather than
Ohio, where his home is. Mindel
would hope to read in Jurisprudence
at Oxford.

Washburn, major in Economics
and sixth ranking scholar in his
class, for three years manager of the
swimming team, would also apply
from Virginia, and if successful,
would read in Modern Greats (eco-
nomics, political science, and philos-
: ophy).

Conferences will be held in the
various states in December, at which
time sixteen Rhodes Scholars from
all over the country will be chosen
for a two-year stay at Oxford. The
scholarships were established early
in this century by Cecil Rhodes, in
order to draw together the best
young men from the English-speak-
ing countries.

One of last year’s W&L candidates,
Tim Vanderver, won a Rhodes schol-
arship and is now in Oxford.

The announcement was made by
Dr. James G. Leyburn, chairman of
the Rhodes Scholarship Committee.

 

Magazine Editor To Visit
Department of Journalism

Paul Herron, editor of Potemac
Magazine. the Sunday supplement
of the Washington Post, will visit
Washington and Lee University’s de-
partment of journalism and com-
munications Friday and Saturday.

Herron will be gathering informa-
tions and pictures for an article on
the department, which was founded
in 1925 as the Lee Memorial Jour-
nalism Foundation, and whose or-
igins trace back to the years when
Gen. Robert E. Lee was president of
the school. The department moved
into new quarters in Reid Hall, com-
pletely remodeled to provide jour-
nalism facilities, in September, 1964.

Tonight at 7:30 p.m. Herron will
speak to journalism majors in the
Reid Hail Library.

that this had resulted in plans on

Dean Atwood confirmed reports that Freshman Class parents
would be excluded from this year’s Parents’ Weekend activities.
We feel their complaints are just.

The decision, which was made last year by the Parents’
Council, was the result of the growing number of parents who
attended the annual affair. The lack of housing facilities neces-
sitated the move. But we feel this does not justify dropping
the program for freshmen parents, but rather gives strong
justification for such a program.

A substitute program, for frosh parents, which was held
on Labor Day this year, was inserted to replace the weekend
which gives parents an opportunity to observe student life at
Washington and Lee.

However, this type program is grossly inadequate simply
because student life at that early date (what student life?)
answers none of the questions which no doubt have taxed
middle-aged minds.

Although the faculty contends that they can tell nothing
to parents about freshman grades at such an early date, many
parents would rather hear it from the professor’s mouth, than
read on an IBM sheet 500-miles away that their son (“who's
always made good grades’) has three S’s and two U’s.

The major question most parents want to know, however,
is “what kind of boys are in the fraternity my son pledged?”

Stories surrounding fraternities, especially from a parent’s

view, can be alarming. Most have no real basis. Yet, if “Our |

Johnny” has trouble, grade-wise or otherwise, the fraternity is
immediately blamed. Many charges aimed at fraternities are un-
just, however, the fraternity has no opportunity to prove it-
self. This is a factor the Parents’ Council neglected; yet it is
a factor which has a great deal of validity.

Parents’ Weekend is not an opportunity to “fleece naive
parents” as the administrator contends, but rather an oppor-
tunity to build good public relations between parents and
fraternity. The human, by instinct, questions the unknown.
That’s why it’s imperative parent-fraternity relations begin be-
fore the sophomore year. And that’s the reason fraternities are
finding themselves in an embarrassing position this week at-
tempting to tactfully tell the same parents they sent letters to
last week encouraging them to attend Parents’ Weekend that
the University “doesn’t want them.”

A second factor we feel should be noted. Much of the
enthusiasm of Parents’ Weekend in the past has been generated
by freshman parents. We feel that as a result of a pleasant first
experience many enjoy returning. However, after their son has
become completely acclimated to his new environment they
wouldn’t be as likely to come for the first time.

Thirdly, most parents, whether they can attend or not,
view a special weekend specifically for them as a sign the Uni-
versity cares. The Labor Day fiasco they view as nothing more
than common courtesy.

The IFC plans to present a resolution to the Parents’
Council when it meets on October 29. It is hoped that the
group will have foresight to realize that Washington and Lee
is depriving many parents an opportunity, which otherwise they
may not take, to become an active part of this University.

‘Am I Destroying Washington and Lee?’

 

Mr. Lee Kahn, the new professor
of drama and director of the Trou- |
badour Theatre at W&L, is a man|
with a goal.

He wants to make the University’s
drama into true educa-
tional theatre. It isn’t now, he says.

“As as I can the Troub

Byrne Replies to Ruffin,

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir,

I was surprised to hear the ques-
tion, “Who is Nick Ruffin?”, cireu-
lating through the law school Wed-
nesday afternoon. I had assumed
from Mr. Ruffin’s comments (The
Ring-tum Phi, October 5, 1964) on
Tuesday that he knew a number of
W&L law students and that a num-

ber of the W&L law students must
surely know him. This assumption
was justified, I think, in view of

the “inside” information (obviously
obtained through inter-
views with law students) contained
in his column

Soccer Team
Injuries Slow

WE&L Offense

Washington and Lee’s varsity soc-
cer team evened out its record at
2-2 dropping the fourth game of
the season Wednesday to Lynchburg
College, 4-1. W&L, suffering from
some injuries, could never mount
much of an offensive until Claude
Rogers finally scored in the fourth
period.

Lynchburg dominated the game.
They started off with a quick score
by White after only three minutes of
play. According to Coach Joe Lyles,
this score set up the momentum for
future Lynchburg points. The rest
of the first period consisted of hold-
ing off the powerful Lynchburg
drives.

Defense held for most of the sec-
ond quarter. However, the highly
talented freshman white scored
again for Lynchburg with 8:22 left
in the period. This goal ended the
scoring for the first half.

The third period seemed very sim-
ilar to the first. Again, White scored
after about three minutes of play and
again, W&L was occupied with pro-
tecting its end of the field. It was
all the Generals could do to keep
Lynchburg from scoring.

The fourth quarter brought about |

scores by both teams. Langsday
scored the final point for Lynchburg
and Rogers, with an assist by Al
Craig, scored the single point of the
game for the Generals. The second
squads of both teams played the
majority of the final period. Lynch-
burg made 37 attempts at scoring
while W&L made five.

An outstanding job was accom-
plished by Ward Briggs, who saved
17 goals for the Generals.

Injuries probably played a part in
the loss according to Coach Lyles.
The injuries to some varsity players
hindered practice during the week
and as a result, the team was a little
bit cold in its passing and heading.

Today, the Generals host Davis and
Elkins at 3:15 p.m.

NOTICE

If the person who forgetfully slip-
ped a typewriter belonging to the
Ring-tum Phi into his pocket and
walked off with it Wednesday night
will return it to the Ring-tum Phi
office under cover of darkness, he
will probably go  unprosecuted
though unforgiven.

Bensinger Outbids Tues.

Dear Mom and Dad,

Congratulations to the Tuesday
edition, Harry Aggannis, and a six-
pack of Busch (why six Busches?
One would do). However, the Friday
edition will not let this bush league
attempt to rouse reader interest
prevail. From the office tomes of
Ford “Do Nothing” Frick comes a
dazzier good for a bottle of cham-
pagne (Tuesday staff take note: this
is a major league). The Los Angeles
Dodgers, with an as yet still unoffi-
cal .245 team batting average, will
most likely possess the lowest sea-
son batting of a World
Series contestant in modern baseball
history. Who did they undercut, and
in what year did this team of banjo-
boppers hit for a rousing 247
average?

Generals Seek Initial Victory;
Take On Centre Here Saturday

The Washington and Lee Generals
will seek their initial victory of
the young season against Centre to-
morrow on the W&L gridiron. After
back to back defeats at the hands |
of Randolph-Macon and Hampden-
Sydney, the incentive is high to re-
bound against the hard hitting
Centre eleven.

Centre, with a record to date of |
2-0-1, comes into the game Satur- |
day with an impressive win over
Southwestern last week, 10-9. Out-|
weighed at all the line positions, the |
Centre

team hit harder and em-
ployed a “blitz” defense to offset |
the power of Southwestern. To!

linebackers and, on some occasions,
their free safety man. Tom Young,
a senior tackle who plays both ways,
will anchor the line, which makes
up in determination what it lacks in
size.

The Generals have made some
basic changes in their win-T offense
to combat the blitzing linebackers
of Centre and to “open up” their
attack to score. You will probably

short passes over the middle to the,
which the linebackers have |

frequently use this type of defense, |
Craig will stick mainly to the short
“button-hook” and “look-in” pat-
terns. Hampered in the H-S game
by a sore arm which affected his
long passes, Craig will seldom have
time to throw the “bomb,” and
thus can concentrate on the short
passing attack. There have been a
few slight alterations in the running
game, due primarily to numerous
injuries in the backfield. With the
loss of first string halfbacks Mike
Bear and Rudd Smith, and injuries
to Billy Andrews and Larry Craig,
Coach Lee McLaughlin will go with
such experienced men as Bob Mil-
ler and John Anthony, but also with

inexperienuce in the persons of John
Bogart and Buddy Atkins, a terror
at 132 pounds. Bogart, playing his
first varsity game last week at H-S,
was very impressive and should see
considerable action against Centre.
Since all of these backs are small
and fast, you may see a lot of sweeps

| to offset the aggressive and hard hit-

ting line of Centre.

With the loss of Warren Stewart
and Rob Reading at the two end
spots, Craig will be throwing to two
new receivers. However, the rest of
the line appears to be in fine shape
and should give the Centre line a
good battle. Not lacking in size, the
scrappy Generals can look ahead to
some rough football and fierce
blocking.

The Centre offensive attack relies
mainly on their outstanding quart-
erback, Jim LaMonica. He is a mas-
ter of the “rollout” run or pass
option, often using the “bootleg”
method of concealing the ball, Also
they have a talented back in Tom
Boone who should add to their var-
ied attack. The Generals will have
to contain Boone and LaMonica and
the end sweps and rollouts in or-
der to halt their offense. However,
the major problem for the generals
will be to move against the stout
Centre defense, which held the high
scoring Southwestern to a mere nine

 

points.

Noting a few sidelights about last
week’s game and tomorrow’s, Coach
McLaughlin mentioned he was im-
pressed with the all-around play of
guard Logan Bullitt on defense. If
the aggressiveness of the line play
continues to increase the W&L backs
will find more opportunity in the
future to turn on the speed, es-
pecially Buddy Atkins. Coach Mc-
Laughlin noted that without the
services of two first string halfbacks
and the injury to Billy Andrews, he
will be playing a very inexperienced
backfield, but personnel with a great
deal of potential. One last note: the
first points the Generals score to-
morrow will be the first of the year,
so let’s see them go right from the
opening kickoff. What do you say we
go in force and cheer them on to
victory.

erated by civil rights issues as such.
For the most part such issues don’t
exist in Los Angeles and Chicago.
These riots were indications of wide-
spread economic dissatisfaction. One
might go so far as to call them
proletarian uprisings.

These riots give evidence to a very
serious problem which the leaders of
most of the great northern cities
have been doing their best to solve
for some time. The War on Poverty
is aimed at situations like these,
though only time will tell if it is
going to be effective enough to solve
this problem. It will most likely be
a long, slow process, making very
limited progress on a small scale.

This problem has by no means
been helped by the “great crusades”
that Dr. Martin Luther King has
been leading in many northern cities.
This past summer, I witnesed first
hand Dr. King’s crusade in Chicago.
Mayor Daley offered several times
to meet with Dr. King and discuss
Chicago's racial problems, but Dr.
King refused. Instead, he chose to
lead a large demonstration in Chica-
go while the mayor was out of town
on official busines. Dr. King led ten
thousand in a march on city hall
and there announced that Chicago
was no “Jerusalem on the shores of
Lake Michigan” (certainly no sur-
prise to anyone who has ever been
there). Nothing in the way of con-
structive achievements is wrought
by these demonstrations in the
streets. They are harmful disruptions
to say the least. However, we can
probably expect a god bit more of
this in the future.

Strange as it may sound at this
time, there is, I think, a good bit of
hope for racial harmony, peace, and
order in the not so distant future
in the South, but no such hope in
the North. It may well be that the
agony of Selma is near its end, but
that of Watts has only just begun.

Tuesday Edition

| Hazing: Vestige Of The Past _

Every year at this time the evidence of fraternity hazing
crops-up from almost every corner of the campus. This hon-
ored ‘tradition’ which is carefully passed on from generation
to generation is in fact beginning to lose its hold especially
among the sophomores who constitute the citadel of its
strength.

There is, of course no justification for continuing the sort
of physical hazing which is still characteristic of pledge pro-
grams in far too many houses. The old cliche of “pledge class
unity” which is cited as reason enough for these activities lacks
demonstrative proof.

Constructive Pledging

In light of the many problems of freshman assimilation it
appears that the fraternity pledge program could provide
the one real opportunity of impressing the value of traditions
to the neophyte. It goes without saying that the example which
the fraternity sets has a tremendous effect on the attitudes and
actions of the freshmen. A constructive training program would
be valuable to the fraternity as well as to the entire University
community,

Rallies and ‘line-ups’ designed to test the physical and some- |
times mental, endurance of freshmen defeat the whole pur-
pose of pledge orientation. Unfortunately, it is generally the
sophomores who cling to this nineteenth century form of pun-
ishment, primarily because they seek revenge for the previous
year. If the system is to be rectified, the initiative for such
change will of necessity come from the freshmen themselves.

Freshmen unite! You have nothing to loose but your
pledge pins.

Refreshing Note

The freshman class is reveling in the freedom of a wide-
open primary election. There are thirty candidates, each
of whom is convinced of his own deserving merit and enduring
worth and just about everybody thinks he is going to win.

We view this as one of the most healthy political develop-
ments at Washington and Lee in many years. For the first time,
individual qualification for office is of paramount importance.

Freshman Initiative
For the first time, freshman are completely taking the initia-
tive in campaigning and organizing for a candidate. It is re-
freshing to note that for the first time in many years, the usual-
ly omniscient campus politicos are at loss to control or even
follow the freshman elections. It is healthy and it is good.

Freshmen have a large field of candidates, making for a
certain measure of confusion in separating the wheat from the
chaff. This will necessitate a good deal of concentration on the
part of the voting freshman just to remember the names of
the men he wants to elect. However, at this price, freedom is
cheap.

This week celebrates the Melina
Mercouri festival at Ed Side’s and
my two or three regular readers of
year will, I am sure remember my
affection for the only MM. The first
of these movies is Never on Sunday,
written, produced and _ directed
by Jules Dassin as a paean to
the charm and “beauty that is
Greece” and, coincidentally, Miss
Mercouri’s also, Dassin is an expa-
triate American Producer-Director
who left this country in self-pro-
claimed exile after his early pictures
were denounced as not only un-
American but downright non-Holly-
wood, He junketed around
Europe for about four years mak-
ing Rififi and He Who Must Die, the
former a classic in the spine- ting-
ling suspense category to which
Topkapi is his most recent addition.
He followed these up with Never on
Sunday and Where the Hot Wind
Blows. The former a sort of female
Zorba The Greek in that both show
the same eflervescent albeit evanes-
cent Greek emotion. Zorba never
loses his humor, Melina never loses
her smile. Those who have seen
Zorba can easily picture Melina ag-
ing into a Lila Kedrova

also

The film has never won an Aeca-
demy as it had to compete with La
Dolce Vita and L'Avventura, but
nevertheless won the Grand Prize
at the Cannes Film Festival, 1960.

 

Sic Semper Tyrannis

 

Current Cinema
A, TLL eR

The acting of Dassin as the quixo-
tic American is somewhat exagger-
ated and occasionally quite amateur-
ish.

The real actors are the people,
the deliberately ugly, greasy, lov-
ing people of Greece who put hap-
piness above work and life above
leisure. Dassin elevates parable
into drama. The film is most not-
able because of Dassin's great tal-
ent for working in crude, natural
surroundings and drawing ener-
getic and colorful performances
from the actors.

It is a great, bright comedy with
a sound foundation about an Amer-
ican who comes to Greece in search
of the truth and meets the altruistic
prostitute Lila. Throughly enchanted
with her, he disenchants her with
the cold steel facts of truth, culture
and moral values, but it is finally
Homer (Dassin) who becomes dis-
enchanted to find there is more joy

ing for truth.
As a frustrated Greek student I
also appreciate the discreet use of

subtitles (which are in only a third
of the film accentuate the difference
in language which in turn under-
scores differences in culture and en-
vironment. The color values of the

demic as the native dances and the
bouzoukia music.

World of the Coat &

Artel Stands Out
As Intellectual,
Individualistic

By MIKE NATION

The intellectual reawakening on
campus of the past decade has taken
many forms. At many schools it has
meant sit-ins, teach-ins, public
meetings, and other forms of activ-
ism. The college student demands
that he must be heard.

This desire to be heard exists for
various reasons, but the most im-
portant of these is, as Saturday Re-
view puts it, the “struggle for relev-
ance.”

True Individualism

A potent medium for this struggle
for relevance, this seeking out of
himself, this pushing forth true in-
dividualism, is the student literary
magazine. Quoting again from Sat-
urday Review “...the one poem, or
short story, by a student writer can
| tell a good deal about what is im-
| portant the college generation,
and how he copes with being irrelev-
ant.

“There are thousands of silent
, wars and hundred of minor faiths
| on campus. These come to the sur-
| face of student literary magazines.”
Ariel Two Years Old

Three and one-half years ago
Ariel was founded on this campus.
In the words of the first editor, it
was to be “a literary review which
was to be written and published by
students of this University.” There
was to be no faculty supervision, no
University financial subsidy in the
publication of the magazine.

The editor further stated: “Some-
one asked me, after Ariel's founding,
what our protest, what our crusade
would be. I replied none. Later, I
| realized that Ariel was a kind of
crusade—a crusade which has been
| and is the publication of the maga-
| zine. A crusade a la tres chere, a la
tres belle

Unusually Refreshing

At a time when there are argu-
ments nauseum about conven-
| tional dress ond other superficiali-
ties, Ariel stands out medium
of true intellectual thought and in-
| dividualism. The thoughts end ideals

Generals Score First
TD, but Lose Third

Lady Luck seems to have shunned the Washington and Lee
eleven at least for the present as Centre College of Kentucky

prevailed here Saturday by the

score of 12-7. This is the third

consecutive game in which victory has eluded the Generals.
The Colonels scored first as Ben Boone raced 19 yards,

but four minutes later fullback John Anthony evened the
score on an eight yard run, Skip*-—-—— -

Jacobsen converted the extra point
to give Washington and Lee its first
touchdown and first lead of the year.

The lead lasted for a short time

only as with two minutes left in the |:

half Centre quarterback Joe La-
Monica hit Boone with a pass that
covered 41 yards and put the ball on
the Generals’ six yard line. Three
plays later the Colonels pushed the
ball across the goal line to regain
the lead, 12-7,
W&L Dominates Second Half

In the second half Washington
and Lee dominated the play as
Anthony repeatedly burst through
the Centre line to pick up big gains,
but the Generals were unable to
push across the winning tally.

Anthony was the individual star as
he proved the workhorse with 129
yards gained in 29 carries. He scored
on a 28 yard dash in the third
quarter which was called back be-
cause of a cliping penalty. This
touchdown would have been de-
cisive, but the unnecessary clip as
Anthony crossed the goal line wiped
out the possible victory. In the
fourth quarter Anthony personally
took the Generals to the Colonels
nine yard line where a fourth down
pass by Jim Oram fell incomplete
as the game ended.

Defense Outstanding Again

The Generals’ defense was again
outstanding as it held the Colonels
without a first down in the second
half and only five in the first half.
Linebackers Joe Miller and Jeff
Novinger and linemen Charlie My-
ers, Starke Sydnor, and Bob Bar-
clay were particularly outstanding,
as was safetyman Larry Craig. Mil-
ler culminated his outstanding day
by intercepting a Centre quick pass
over the middle.

Pro football is becoming more and
more like baseball every day. Only
a few years ago the starting quar-
terback went the distance on of-
fense unless he was deterred by an
injury. Now pro football has a new
player known as the “relief pitcher.”
This character is the second string
quarterback, a man who must be
capable of coming into the ball game
cold to relieve the starter when he
is unable to move his ball club. The
starter also may be relegated to the
“bullpen” if he has too many bad
games like Sonny Jurgensen of the
Washington Redskins, and he be-
comes the “reliver.”

The two platoon system in college
football has not taken the fancy of
all the coaches. Ed Merrick of the
University of Richmond has discov-
ered that his best offensive players
are often his best defensive men. He
has gone back to the high school
system of two platooning at certin
positions having two-way performers
at the other positions.

Coach Bear Bryant of the Uni-
versity of Alabama has retreated to
the old system of strings. In short,
he has a first, second, third team,

than specialize. He finds that this

platoon method with the personnel
on the Alabama club.
Homecoming Game

Homecoming games are usually
scheduled such that the home team
will win, but Washington and Lee
seems to have failed in this goal.
The Generals play Guilford College
of North Carolina Saturday in the
Homecoming games. Guilford ap-
pears to be too strong for the winless
Generals but upsets are nothing new
in Lexington.

Comparative scores are interesting,
but do not mean much. Hampden-
Sydney beat Bridgewater, 14-7, and
whipped the Generals by two
touchdowns. Guilford beat the Tig-
ers, 28-3, and Saturday smashed
Bridgewater, 56-6. Make your won
conclusions.

Street and Smith's yearly football
magazine appropriately entitled
Football is noted for its excellent
college football preseason previews,
yet some of the country’s outstand-
ing college football teams are not

 

mentioned. How can anyone write
| a college football magazine and omit
| such schools as Florida A&M, Gram-
| bling, and Jackson St. to name a few
io the many outstanding all-Negro
colleges which have football teams?
The country’s best football may be
| played in leagues like the Central
Intercollegiate Athletic Association.

Kinney Scores Three, Cannon Adds Two In Rout

By MARK EAKER

Dick Kinney scored three touch- |
downs and Dee Cannon two as the |

W&L freshmen
Military School,
Field Friday.

Kinney was the leading ground
gainer with 127 yards on 12 carries
Cannon raced for 82 yards on 7
tries. Altogether the W&L offense
pushed across 335 yards total of-
fense.

The first W&L score came with
9:58 left in the first quarter when

Kinney broke through the Fish-
burne line and sped 52 yards. This
was the first touchdown of the sea-
son for a W&L football team. The
kick for the extra point failed.
Three minutes later Jeb Brown

recovered a Fishburne fumble on
their 48. Successive 8-yard runs by
Brown and Kinney and an Al Tom-
lin pass to Charlie Freret moved the
ball to the 28 where Kinney took
over and raced the distance to the
end zone. The point after failed again
and the score stood at 12-0. The sec-
ond quarter was scorless.

In the second half Fishburne was
still unable to move against the de-
fense led by John Wolf. Freret in-
tercepted a pass at the Fishburne 23

Booters Top
Davis-Elkins
For 3rd Win

The soccer team of Davis and
Elkins College from West Virginia
visited Lexington last week as
merely a wonder of dubious nomen-
clature and reputation but left the
town as a total nonentity in the an-
nals of W&L athletics after being
squelched by the score of 6-0 in a
game that can only politely be
called a rout.

The Washington and Lee attack
was centralized about the able and
consistent play of the General half-
backs. Offensively, the home team
had ample opportunity to score as is
evidenced by one-sided the outcome.
Defensively, the W&L team was also
outstanding as the Davis and Elkins

squad was limited to only three
shots at the Washington and Lee
! | goal.

Shinkle and Craig Star

Brad Shinkle and Allen Craig
shared scoring honors for the Gen-
erals by each tallying twice. Shinkle
scored the first two goals of the con-
test in the first and second quarters.
Craig added his two goals in the
third and fourth periods.

The other two scores were made
by Ed Hutchins in the third quar-
ter and Richie Hamilton in the fourth
quarter to make the final result a
6-0 shutout.

As far as overall play is concerned,
Coach Joe Lyles named Shinkle,
freshman Scott Fechney, and Co-
captain David Redmond as the out-
standing players in the game. With
this triumph the W&L team ha

pulled its seasonal record to 3-2.

one like Macbeth, tragic, yet made
up entirely of human matter. Fate
acts against this character by purely
believable circumstances, stacking
the deck, card by card against him.
These circumstances, due to some
moral deficiency on the part of the
central figure preclude his escaping
the inevitable tragedy. We are then
shown, by one dramatic action,
either a basie vice or virtue of the
character which leads to emotional
or physical collapse or bankruptcy.

This collapse relates the char-
acter’s usefulness in a world where
basic goodnes or at least more-
goodness than evil, is essential for
survival.

This pattern has been used notably
in ancient literature and in modern
writing, just as the theme of Phaedra
has. We always see a tragic hero

who evokes from the audience not
only pity but reprehension, and
more pity than reprehension. It has
been universally gratifying to play
god in judging the tragic hero while
his fate is being unravelled.

In this version, the antagonist is
Aphrodite, the goddess of love we
meet briefly in a museum. All of
the characters are her unsuspecting
victims. The point is not that they
are immoral. We see the pride of
Alexis and the bull-headed fury of
Thanos, but they are not tragic
causes here. All characters are equal
they are all three neither cause nor
result, ends nor means. We are
shown instead the ancient Greek
idea of a supernatural force work-
ing on three very close people ef-
fecting a triple disaster.

The theme, or observation to be
cited here is that if a man is to deal
in a world of immeasurable and un-
reliable forces, he must do his best
to maintain his humility before his
gods, patience with himself and
charity for his neighbors. Good and
evil transcend the individual case
of Macbeth and affect the entire
group. Evil is never, in its overt state,
controlled by human powers. It is
less than human and more,

Particularly striking in this

 

movie are the visual images.
Phaedra’s Doir dresses resemble
togas; like Phaedra they are plain,
but uniquely beautiful. Urgency
symbols are the ringing telephone,
the burning cigarette. When Alexis
calls the airport to get out of Paris,
he plays with the light switch,
flicking it on and off as his desire
swells and ebbs,

When Phaedra lies on the beach
awaiting Alexis, she grows more and
more anxious for his return. As the
anxiety turns to passionate despera-
tion, we are shown alternately
the sun on double image with Me-
lina’s face brilliantly set off by the
rays of her hair. Yet when Alexis
comes he appears in a cool silhouette
and blocks out the sun. He calmly
rejects her and she is once more left
to bake in the sun. As Erecy goes
to a party Alexis under Phaedra’s
eye, the band plays “London Bridge

is falling down,” the same bridge on
which Phaedra made her sacrifice to
Alexis.

The greatest fault of the movie
is Tony Perkins who should have
stayed on his water skies at Rol-
lins. Although partly salving him-
self by his final dramatic reading
in which he is escorted out “by old
John Sebastian himself,” he looks
like a litthe boy who has just walk-
ed in on his mother while she was
in the bathtub,

These two movies, I feel, show ef-
fectively amorality of Greek life at
two levels, the very rich and the
very poor. Both show that life may
be lived in the pursuit of happiness,
but not in the escape from morality.

Tyler Ends Fight With Awad

but I think that he should consider
all of the people who are concerned
with the problem.

Not only is the present student
body concerned with the “problem,”
but so is the administration and
faculty. So, too, are the alumni. The
present student body should not be
able to do away with conventional
dress, or the Honor System, merely
because it feels free to do so. Do not,
however, think that this statement
means that I believe the student
body is in favor of such repeal. I
believe that the students at Wash-
ington and Lee are in favor of main-
taining the traditions of the Univer-
sity.

I also believe that there is more
involved here than either Awad
or I want. There is more involved
here than the student body wants.
The personal whims, the likes and
dislikes of students here. cannot be
all powerful. A certain amount of
respect is expected from each stu-
dent.

Respect, however, must be earned;
it cannot be forced on people This
is where “spirit” enters the picture,
and we are back where we started.
Without this respect, love; call it

what you will, a person's college

experience will not be a complete
one. I do not mean that one must
cherish the very ground on which
his college was built, nor do I mean
that the school can do no wrong.

I do means that my experience at
Washington and Lee has ben, and
will continue to be, one of the most
cherished times of my life. But again,
there is now way that I can convey
this to others without leaving my-
self open to ridicule by those who
do not feel as I do.

So, here I will close my argument
answering Alwad’s question by say-
ing, “No, Awad, I do not think that
you are destroying Washington and
Lee.” It would take a hell of a lot
more than you have to offer to do
that. So, Awad, keep sereaming as
Il am certain that you will do,

Viet Conflict

Picketing
Scheduled

In apparent conjunction with the
University of California at Berkeley's
“Peace March” Weekend, a pray-in

Commons have
Washington and Lee for today and
tomorrow.

A crudely lettered poster on the
ODK bulletin board urging stu-
dents to demonstrate against the
United States involvement in Viet-
nam called for students to join a
special Holy Communion service this
afternoon at the Robert E. Lee Epis-
copal Church, but Tom Brown, the
church’s chaplain to W&L, empha-
sized that the service is in no way
connected with any protests, that it
was scheduled to ask for general
world peace, and that no students
consulted with him before posting
the notice of a Pray-In.

The organizers of the Berkeley
demonstration said to the New York
Times Monday that this weekend
would see protests in seventy cities
around the world, including ones in
Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hun-
gary behind the Iron Curtain. In
this country, marches will be held in
Los Angeles, New York City, Boston,
Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit, and
Macon, Georgia.

Dean Atwood has noted that while |
the administration does not object to
peaceful demonstrations on campus
the Lexington Police Department is

cause of the heavy traffic expected
on Saturday with Homecomings,

urges students to remain on Uni-

versity property to avoid arrest.

Faceless Protest

Lexington is bracing itself for its first seige of “Berkeley-
ism’ Saturday, but thus far the leaders of the group which is
supposed to picket the Commons (of all places) protesting
“U.S. Agression in Viet Nam,” have not seen fit to disclose
their identities.

Although we have no qualms about anybody demonstrat-
ing anything, it seems reasonable to expect such avid support-
ers of the protest to at least admit it. The rumors and sus-
picions surrounding the demonstration seem to be accomplish-
ing nothing but placing a great many people who are not in-
volved in an embat rassing position explaining that they are not
demonstrating.

If, on the other hand, the demonstrators are having dif-
ficulty locating an abundance of pacificts in Lexington, may we
recommend Demonstration, Inc, (there really is such an organ-
ization.) They advertise “our trained terrorists can tie up any
town. We guarantee to confuse the issue so nobody can ar-

rive at a solution!”

W&L Test Quakers
In Homecoming Tilt

The Quakers of Guilford will in-
vade the town of Lexington to face
W&L’s Generals this Homecoming
Weekend. The Guilford eleven, with
a record to date and 1, will
furnish the toughest opposition W&L
has met yet.

Off an impressive 56-6 win ove1
Bridgewater last Saturday the Quak-
ers really seem to have their offense
rolling. They've beaten Hampden-
Sydney 23-8, Elon 7-0, their
loss coming at the hands of Western
Carolina. The Generals lost to Hamp-
den-Sydney, a common opponent,
13-0, but comparative scores should
mean very little in this match.

The Guilford team uses a variety

of offenses, including an I forma-
tion, the wing-T, and a “shotgun”
or spread alignment. To augment

this combination, the Quakers ex-
hibit numerous fast and big backs.
The first is in the person of Bill
Berchett, the starting quarterback.
An excellent short he can
run when the opportunity presents
itself, The backfield also features
fullback Bobby Belvins and halfback
Tommy Grayson. Both Belvins and
Grayson are big and fast and add
considerably to the power of the I
formation and the speed needed for
the spread.

Henry McKay, another very val-
uable factor in the Guilford offense,
returns the punts and kickoffs. The
line is anchored by Ronnie Wins-

“Neutrals.” The United States is the
leader, protector and fortress of the
West. Now, whether we like it or
not, the East and West are fighting
each other in all parts of the world
every day. The East is bent on con-
quering the West, and the West is
determined that this should not
happen.

Since 1945, the East has been win-
ning victory after victory (Korea
excepted). Usually, they have used
internal

evasive tactics (such as
revolution) that are difficult to
counter. This time, though, they

have come out into the open and

started the war—we didn’t. What's

W&L Defeats Guilford in Tight Game

By CHARLIE FRERET

Victory was snatched from the
jaws of defeat Saturday as the un-
derrated Generals of Washington and
came from behind with less than
two minutes to go to whip Guilford
College of North Carolina, 26-20, be-
fore a jubilant homecoming crowd.

Before the crowd had gotten set-
tled, Guilford had put the first points
of the game on the scoreboard on
an eight yard pass from Bill Bur-
chette to halfback Tommy Grayson,
followed by Grayson’s conversion.
The next time Guilford gained pos-
session of the football the Quakers
crossed the goalline again, and again
it was Burchette passing to Grayson,
this time for 45 yards for the touch-
down, Grayson added the extra point
to provide a 14-0 margin.

Washington and Lee could not
sustain a march and was forced to
punt again. Burchette took charge
and drove the Quakers downfield,
climaxing the drive by scoring on a
two yard plunge to up the score to
20-0. Meanwhile the Generals were
finding the going tough against the
big Guilford defense and could sree!

vide no excitement for their fans.
Then a play occurred which was
to be lucky for W&lL and unlucky
for Guilford. A Burchette pass to
Henry MeKay was good for 39 yards,
but McKay dropped the ball on the
29 when hit. The ball took a Guil-
ford bounce and landed in the hands
of Quaker end Tommy Lovell who
sped the remaining yards for an ap-

parent seore and a 26-0 lead. Here
the crowd sensed a rout, but Lady

showed her blessings to
Generals as Guilford was penal-
ized for holding. Unable to advance,
Guilford forced to punt and
W&L took over. Bryant Kendrick,
starting his second game at
quarterback, got the Generals mov-
ing. Reaching the Guilford 32 yard
line, the Generals found their drive
momentarily stopped, but off the
bench came third string quarterback
Andy Bloom to loft a pass to end
Rob Reading to put the Generals on
the scoreboard. The half ended with
Guilford in front, 20-6.

Nine-Member Fraternities

To Explore Possibility

Of 2-Party System

Conceding that politic as present-
ly constituted at Washington and Le«

permanently dissolved itself. The
nine member fraternities declared
their intention to explore possibili-
ties for a “workable, wide-open, and
acceptable” two party system

Dormant Since “Big Four”

The University Party declined to
nominate candidates in last Spring’s
clas selections, because of the pre-
judice it was assumed had been built
up against the Party during the
“Big Four” election. It was the only
party to nominate candidates for
the “Big Four” last term; the Lib-
berty and Progressive Parties went
by default

Agreement was reached at last
week's meeting on a proposal to
make an extensive study of parti
and polities on other campuses with
an eye toward adopting certain fea-
tures into a two-party political or-
der for Washington and Lee. Thi
research would be earried on by
both individuals and [raternitic

Homecoming Game 1965: Well Done!

It seems only appropriate, indeed mandatory, to extend
congratulations to the football team for their spectacular per-
formance on Saturday. The Generals displayed the kind of
dogged determination which has always been characteristic of
our teams over the years. Saturday’s game provided one of
those rare opportunities to witness a surge of school spirit on a
grand scale.

It would be impossible to single out any one player as the
key to the victory. Quite obviously, the momentum for the
second half rally was a product of an all out team effort. In
light of the wanning spirit of both the players and the student
body, prior to this weekend, the result is even more incredible.

School spirit is a perennial problem which has plagued
this campus for a number of years. Since the end of “big time”
football at Washington and Lee in 1955, there has been a de-
cline in attendance and interest among a growing number of
students. It is easy to see the origin of this problem and the
manner in which it is perpetuated—the solution is quite an-
other thing.

The spirit and enthusiasm which was evident on Saturday
was a breath of fresh air in the often apathetic atmosphere of
our campus. Attendance at the game was well over that of the
previous week, although not nearly as large as it should be. Per-
haps the most encourageing sign of the afternoon was the
genuine determination of both the team and the spectators to
stick it out until the end.

In an attempt to combat this apathetic trend the Varsity
Club two years ago instituted the Sem cheerleaders and the
special cheering section in the stands. Although we still have
the Sem girls, the cheering section seems to have been dis-
carded. We would suggest that the Varsity Club encourage this
activity during the next home games.

The remaining two home games will afford ample oppor-
tunity fo reach student to maintain the spirit of this past week.
Certainly, the football team deserves this minimal effort on our
part, and more important school spirit in itself is healthy and
valuable,

Regardless of the outcome of this season we are confident
that our team will continue to display the spirit of Homecom-
ings. The crucial question now is whether the student body can
offer even more support than in the recent past. We owe at
least this much to ourselves,

 

 

A Critique of Homecomings-Openings

By BRUCE W. RIDER

As I was sitting upon our fair
campus the other day counting dogs,
I marveled at the splendid organiza-
tion we have at Washington and Lee
(it’s beautiful here in the fall, isn’t
it, with the golden leaves drifting
slowly down through the misty haze
of a sleepy October afternoon—I’m
not really a nature-boy but I needed
twenty-four more words) that (or
maybe which) allows us to have so
many wonderful activities all on one
single weekend.

We have just wended our way
through a magnificent package of

 

Openings and Homecomings, and we
all certainly had the grandest of
times, did we not?

But do we realize what is happen-
ing? Do we get the big picture, the
long view, the overall standpoint?
What is really going on, my friends,
is that slowly, inch by inch and year

ever they are—they may not know
themselves) are consolidating and
combining activities so that eventual-
ly we will have One Big Weekend—
and that’s all,

An Ideal System

 

Overcrowding In Upper Courses
Detracts From Seminar Approach

By NICK RUFFIN

Washington and Lee is one of those
institutions which are commonly de-
scribed as small, men’s liberal arts
colleges. The advantages of a col-
lege of this type are that the school
is small enough so that one depart-
ment knows that another depart-
ment exists, that the professors in
these departments are in contact
with each other, and that they can
maintain an awareness and attitude
toward education that transcends the
limits of one’s particular field.

As the catalogue says, “because of
Washington and Lee’s emphasis upon
undergraduate education, its faculty
is essentially a body of highly quali-
fied, highly trained men whose first
interest and first responsibility is
teaching.”

A Diploma Factory

At Washington and Lee the stu-
dent should feel that he is more
than just another body in a diplo-
ma factory. The professors are acces-
sable to and interested in the stu-
dent. The student finds he is part of
a community whose collective goal is
liberal education. (For some of you
political conservatives, a liberal edu-

Lee Evaluates Vietnamese War

this “independent  entity”—South
Vietnam. It is obvious that Mr.
Awad’s conception of independence
differs radically from mine. I have
always interpreted independence as
implying “national sovereignty,” the
competence of a regime to imple-
ment policy decisions free of foreign
dictation.

In my estimation, South Vietnam
is as independent of Washington as
Hungary is of Moscow. The present
leaders of South Vietnam give oc-
easional pretense of independence,
but this is merely an experiment in
self-delusion. South Veitnam is

Mr. Awad states that the United

I might ask: What pledge? As Hans
Morganthau has so aptly pointed
out—The only contract we have to
honor is the one we made with our-
selves. The government to which
this pledge was made was one of our
own creation; it was not a govern-

people of South Vietnam.

I only wonder what happened to
this great passion for human liber-
ty, which we so sanctimoniously
espoused, during the years from 1954
to the present in South Vietnam.
Was our concern for the develop-
ment of a viable democracy in South
Vietnam, or was it with the deter-
mination of retaining an effective
bulwark against communist imperial-
ism in Southwest Asia? Was our ex-
uberance over the deposition of Pres-
ident Diem in 1963 a manifestation
of our commitment to individual
liberty, or was it because we rec-

The low faculty to student ratio

by his teeth during the week in order
to escape into weekendly bliss. Who
knows? In years to come the Library
might even stay open on Saturday

Let us look, then to the future, to
see where the present trend of few-
er Big Weekends is taking us.

Life in 1975

The year is nineteen seventy-five.
It is Friday morning, the start of
W&L’s One Big Weekend. Fresh-
men are given name tags and sent
to Freshman Camp. As they travel
on the bus, they are given their
placement examinations.

Once at Natural Bridge they are
rushed by fraternities and they
pledge after lunch. On their way
back to Lexington—the same day,
remember—they register with their
advisors and pay their tuition and
get to know their dorm counsellors.

Meanwhile, back at the U., Open-
ings has begun in the Dining Hall.
At intermission the Opening As-
sembly is held while parents regis-
ter for Parents’ Weekend.

ior Banquet and Alumni Dinner)

 

among our greatest advantages over
larger colleges with higher ratios.
Our professors are live when they
lecture, not on television, They know
us by name and face, not as seat 26.

An Ideal System

Our system sounds ideal, but is it
really? What we have at W&L are
numerous medium sized classes, a
few small, seminar-sized classes, and
a very few large classes. Most pro-
fessors have structured their courses
to be presented to medium or small
classes, of five to fifteen or twenty
students. This structure applies par-
ticularly to upper level courses and
not as much to those on the fresh-
man or introductory level.

The system appears to break down,
though, when the number in a class
rises to be twenty-five, thirty or
above. A middle-sized or small class
appears to become overcrowded and
ineffective at this level of size. The
class itself is not too large to be
handled effectively, but it is too large
to be handled effectively if the ap-
proach is that applicable to a small
class.

As a senior, | am in four courses
above the 200 level which seem to
suffer because they are too large
for the approach being taken. I have
been told of one class that is so large
this year that students have actual-
ly been assigned numbers to expe-
dite taking roll. If names were called
there would be no time for class.
(The solution to this is not to have
a roll, but that is another question.)
The problem is actually not one of
overcrowding but of overloading.

The most obvious solution to the
problem is to expand certain depart-
ments. I suppose that every depart-
ment thinks it needs more men to
lighten the load. Some appear to be
in greater need than others: but to
avoid being hanged in effigy by the
faculty in those not mentioned, I
shall name no names.

This is not to say that one field is
more important than another, but as
a college such as this the students’
free choice of courses should have
some effect on the size of other de-
partments. There is a problem in
trying to match trends; a course
may be crowded one year and go
begging the next. At the same time,
there are some perennial losers.

Another solution would seem to be

the middle-sized class. Does it not
have the faults of a large class with-
out the benefits of a small one? When

This sign, now turned brown

this sign has been viewed with ap-
prehension and fear by the stu-
dents of this university, New it has
become necessary to speak against
the eruel injustice of this agent of
totalitarian coercion.

The sign reads, for these of you
whe have not seen it, “Please Use
Payne Hall entrance.”

The message that the sign conveys
is actually not worthy of protest per
se, but one must think for a moment
just what this sign means and how
it is enforced

First of all, what does it mean’
lt means that students are to use
the Payne Hall entrance when en-

ed by the Founders Day Convoca-
tion,
On Day Weekend?

Saturday dawns. Freshman receive
their S and U reports as they at-
tend Springs concert. When the band
takes a break, the Phi Beta Kappa
Convocation is convoked. After lunch
(at which the birthdays of Lee and
Washington are celebrated) every-
body heads out to Wilson field for
the Homecomings football game.
Baseball and lacrosse are played at
this time on the far field, and cross-
country and soccer provide half time
thrills while the Homecomings Queen
is crowned.

In the evening—after the R. E.
Lee Research banquet—the crowds
crowd into the Commons for Final
Dances. The ODK Assembly is as-
sembled mid-way through the fes-
tivities. After the dance the Bacca-
laureate Service is held, and Seniors
receive their diplomas and went
their way into the world.

Plans are under way for nineteen
seventy-six to continue the trend
with a one day weekend. By nine-

Nation Highlights NFU Weekend
7 and Delt Party

With Footba

Endures ‘Slings and Arrows’ at Party

By MIKE NATION
Since he is not feeling very ener-
getic intellectually, this writer will
eontain his weekly efforts to com-
ments on the weekend just past,
while he emotes silently over the
strains of Judy Collins’ voice.

Coasters Choice Attraction

The consensus (that word is not
patented, is it?) is that it was the
best one in these parts in many-a-
moon, Openings seems to have be-
come a strictly discotheque (a classy
term for rock and roll and its de-
rivatives) weekend. The connoiseurs
thereof appeared to have had a field
day. According to them, the Coasters
were the choice attraction. Chuck
Jackson was not even missed. Tough
bananas, Chuck.

Friday night was highlighted by
the largest organized drunk in the
Great Valley of Virginia. The torch-
light parade to the Gym was a color-
ful sight as was the face of a Sem
cheerleader at the pep rally in re-
sponse to some sort of comment on
elevators.

It was the game on Saturday that
really made the weekend. The Gen-
erals were pushed all over the field
in the first half, and Coach Mac

 

told them at half-time; “I have never
seen a W&L team give up—don’t
make this the first time. They didn’t.

The second half saw the tables re-
versed. The Generals penetrated
Guilford’s 10-yard line five times,
the first two times resulting in frus-
tration. Despite this they went on
to score three times in the final per-
iod.

It appears that the award for the
outstanding player at Homecomings
will again be given to the whole
team. To do otherwise would be
to commit an unpardonable sin.

Winning Tradiiion

The Generals have not been beat-
en at Homecomings in six years. The
last two years have seen them on
the long end of upsets of major pro-
portions. Last year it was Sewanee
who was previously unbeaten in
fourteen games.

A visit to the Delt house Satur-
day night proved most entertaining.
Certainly their new facility is the
best around for the combo sort of
party. Their first dance set weekend
saw the house initiated properly.

Editor Previews Magazine

The Editor of Ariel, Grayson Pow- |
ell, announces that the opportunity |

to subscribe to the student literary
magazine for the current year is
still available.

Ariel regularly features short
stores, poems, and boek reviews by
student writers. This year a new fea-
ture will be introduced: a series of
interviews with such well-known
authors as David Stacton, W&L’'s
writer-in-residence, and John Up-
dike, to be interviewed for the win-
ter issue by his cousin, Philip Hern-
don, a freshman.

Ariel is still flourishing after three
difficult years of publication, despite
the meager subscription support it
has received from students. “Here is
your opportunity,” said Powell, “to
subseribe to one of the best student
literary magazines to be found in the
nation on the undergraduate-school
level. You will be doing yourself a
favor in buying a good readable

 

The Hing-tum Bhi

magazine with a serious purpose and
you will be doing Ariel a favor by
insuring its continued publication.”

The price for all three issues—
autumn, winter, and spring—is $2.00.
Anyqone who wants to subscribe
should see the Ariel subscription
display in the aleove opposite the
east coat-reom in the library, or
they may subseribe through any
staff member.

Manuscript Deadline

Powell reminded students that the
deadline for manuseripts for the
autumn issue is November 8, and
that the magazine is scheduled for
publication on November 22.

The next meting of the Ariel staff
is Thursday night at 7:00 in Room
25 of the Student Union. New staff
members are weleome at any meet-
ing. All staff members should have

read the manuscripts in Ariel's
mailbox before the meeting on
Thursday.

The Ring-tum Phi is published Tuesday and Friday during the college
year. It is printed by the Journaliam Laboratory Press, Washington and
Lee University. The mailing address is Box 899, Lexington, Virginia.

Tuesday S ports

B. S.

By TOM CARPENTER

 

Saturdays in Lexington this fall have been very unexciting, and last
Saturday appeared to be just like the previous ones. Guilford College of
North Carolina was coming in for the Generals’ Homecoming, and the
word was that the Alumni were not going to be in for much of a treat.
Most of them probably expected that the cocktail party at 5:00 would be
the only enjoyable event of the afternoon.

Things began well for the Generals as the won the toss and gained
five yards on the first play without loss of down and without quarterback
Bryant Kendrick ever touching the ball. But the offsides penalty assessed
against Guilford was just about the only factor against them in the first
half.

The Quaker quarterback Bill Burchette looked more like John Unitas
every play. With the first period half gone he hit Tom Grayson with a
swing pass that led to seven points. Early in the second period he pulled
the old Unitas trick of isolating a linebacker as the only pass defender
against a speedy halfback, who was in this case Grayson again. Result:
another six point play followed by another conversion.

General Mistake

Midway through this quarter the Generals made a strategic mistake.
They punted without warning Guilford and the quick kick was blocked
with Fred Gray recovering on the Generals’ 18 yard line. Trouble maker
Grayson took charge and scored in two plays, the second on a one-yard
plunge. But things began to look up for the Generals as the extra point
attempt failed.

W&L meanwhile was looking like the Washington Redskins on offense.
First down number one came with 4:35 remaining in the half.

Finally Coach Lee McLaughlin decided that it was time to unveil his
secret weapon that he obviously had been saving for this game. The Gen-
erals got the ball with very little time left in the half after Guilford’s
fourth touchdown was ruled illegal. Henry McKay took Burchette’s pass
for 39 yards and then decided he wanted to let someone else score the
touchdown. He fumbled on the W&L 29 yard line, and Tom Lovell picked it
up and went into the end zone. But a Guilford player was caught in the
nasty act of holding. He was probably very embarrassed that he was caught.

Bloom to Reading

Then it was that two men who were regarded as defensive special-
ists made their appearance on the scene. No one in the stands seemed
exceptionally excited when Andy Bloom (who?) went in at quarterback
and Rob Reading stepped in at end. Suddenly everyone was excited. With
20 seconds to go Bloom cocked his arm and unleashed a beautiful thing
called a touchdown pass which was accepted by Reading. Summary: 32
yard gain and six points.

As the teams prepared for the second half kickoff, it appeared that the
W&L fans decided that the most interesting thing thus far about Saturday
was the halftime entertainment provided by he Cave Springs High School
band. But a funny thing happened in the second half.

To begin with, Guilford made a mistake by coming out of the locker
room. The Quakers’ next mistake came when they fumbled in the vicinity
of one Billy Andrews who gradded said loose ball at the W&L 49.

The fans were horrified when the offensive unit appeared without the
now not-so-secret weapon. Reliable Bryant Kendrick was in charge, and
he decided to use the Generals’ ground game, i.e., John Anthony, with
aid from Tom Pittman. Drive one failed, but the defense took command
and halted Guilford quickly.

Craig Takes Charge

Larry Craig's punt return to the 35 of the visitors started the new drive.
The Generals reached the 5 and ran into trouble, known as lack of attack.
Coach McLaughlin reacted and tossed one half of his new weapon into the
game. Bloom reacted also by hitting Buddy Atkins with a pass for six
points. It looked like a Mutt-and-Jeff combination. The extra point at-
tempt was a farce as everyone decided to let the hike from center go un-
attached.

Later in the half Grayson—you remember him—decided to take matters
in his own hands and gave Guilford a more comfortable lead, but Craig
would have none of this as he halted Grayson’s 24-yard dash towards
the goal line with a last ditch shoe string tackle.

W&L took over, punted, and stopped Guilford. Craig again was in the
spotlight as he returned a punt 11 yards to the Guilford 37. With first
down on the 26, thanks to Anthony, Bloom resorted to his old tricks with
a new compatriot which resulted in a 25-yard pass play to Tersh Baker at
the one yard line. Baker sacrificed his health to make the catch and was
temporarily deactivated. Kendrick rushed in and carried the ball into the
end zone with 1:40 left in the game.

Bogart Ties Game

Next, Two “B” boys combined to execute the tying conversion. John
Bogart took the handoff and followed Jay “Booming” Bowersox's trap on
the right end for the needed two points. At this point the W&L fans were
overjoyed at the apparent tie game and were quite willing to call it a day,
but Coach MeLaughlin had other ideas.

Reading's kickoff was of the onside variety, and Bogart, who obviously
liked the role of hero, recovered on the Quaker’s 49. Bloom casually
ambled onte the field with one thought in mind, throwing the winning
touchdown pass. He started with an 8-yarder to Baker and then suffered
from a holding penalty. Bloom was not to be discouraged as he hit Read-
ing, his old buddy, for 28 yards to the 26. Baker took the next for 11 yards
to the 15. The tall, lanky New Yorker continued to fill the air with footballs,
but the next two fell unwanted. Then came the moment of truth for the
visitors as Reading eluded company except for the football and went into
the scoring zone untouched by human hands, making it, 26-20, with 46
seconds to play.

The Generals had scored twice in only 54 seconds, a feat that could
be called phenomenal if Minnesota had not scored twice in 22 seconds
against lowa on the same day

Guilford reached the General 47 as W&L yielded yardage willingly to
protect against the bomb. On the last play of the game Bubba Brockwell
unleashed the bomb only to find that his receiver on the seven yard line
was none other than W&L's Billy Andrews. At this point the W&L fans
left for the infirmary in search of cures for laryngitis, while the Guilford
fans just left.

Lyle’s Men Lose Third

 

By MOBY DOWLER

While W&L’s football team was
climaxing a great come-from-behind
victory over Guilford on Homecom-
ing Weekend, the General soccer
team was witnessing the same
achievement—but from a different
point of view. Consequently, the
Gobblers from Virginia Polytechnic
Instituted whittled away at an early
3-0 lead by Washington and Lee and
eventually triumphed in the second
period of overtime play by a margin
of 4-3.

Starting strongly, W&L scored its
three goals in the first half of the
game. Senior co-captain Tim Henry
accounted for all three tallies. The
initial goal was scored on a fast
| break, while the other two were
/seored on a direct kick outside of
the penalty are and a well maneuv-
ered play with an assist by Dave
Kirkpatrick just before halftime.

The second half of the game was

 

 

Cross Country Team

Washington and Lee's cross-coun-
try team was defeated for the first
time this season as Old Dominion

a cross-country meet. The extremely
strong Old Dominion team finished
seven runners before Bill Lowry was
able to reach the finish line.

completely dominated by the VPI
squad. The Gobblers’ hustle and ag-
gressive ball handling enabled them
to score three times and knot the
game into a tie. The final result
then was decided in the second
overtime period.

The first period of the overtime
was uneventful as neither team was
able to mount a successful offensive
and put a winning goal in the net.
During the second period, W&L was

 

called on a foul within the penalty
area which led to the victorious goal
by VPI on a direct kick. This loss
brought the Generals’ seasonal rec-
ord to 3-3,

Washington and Lee’s next game
will be against American University
in Washington, D.C., next Friday.
This shapes up as a revenge game
for the Generals because it was this
team that broke the W&L winning
streak of six last year.

Brigaders Win
Second Game;

Connon Stars

By MARK AKER

Washington and Lee’s Brigaders
unleashed their Cannon, as they beat
a tough Greenbrier team, 13-0, last
Friday in Lexington. The Cannon,
whose first name is Dee, raced for
101 yards on 10 carries, including a
spectacular 65-yard touchdown run
with 5:59 left in the third quarter.

Scoreless Half

Cannon’s run broke up what had
primarily been a game of good sound
defense. In the scoreless first half,
W&L held Grenbrier to 16 yards
total offense. It was good hardhitting
defense with Britt McJunkin, Hank
Wilson, Jeb Brown, Haskell Dickin-
son, and Rein Fischer leading the
way.

Cannon’s TD

The second half started as if it
was going to more of the same until
Cannon’s touchdown. W&L’s second
score came just five minutes later as
McJunkin recovered a Grenbrier
fumble on the visitor’s 27. Eight
plays later quarterback Alan Tomlin
passed to halfback Worth Blackwell
for the score to make it 13-0.

Cannon and Kinney

For the most part W&L dominated
play with the running of Cannon and
Dick Kinney and the pass receiving
of Dickinson, Grenbrier’s only sus-
tained drive came late in the fourth
quarter as quarterback Don Paull
managed to move his team to the
W&L 11. However, a clipping penalty
and some rugged defense moved
Greenbrier back to the 33, where
the drive lost steam and died out.

2-1 Record

The victory left the Brigadiers
with a 2-1 record for the year. Fri-
day they travel to Fork Union Mil-
itary Academy in quest of their third
consequtive victory.

Columnist Lee Examines Aims In Vietnam

(Continued from page 2)
prosecute the war against the in-
digenous Viet Cong? Has our sub-
sequent support for the military
oligarchs in South Vietnam served
as demonstrable proof of our un-
wavering support of democratic in-
stitutions in Asia?

We might ask ourselves why we
have supported Franco in Spain,
Salezar in Portugal, Battista in Cuba
and the military oligarchs in South
America. Is it because of our com-
mitment to democratic ideals? We
might even question that nature of
our foreign aid. Has our economic
and military assistance to these na-
tions been intended to alleviate the
poverty of their people, or has it
been intended to perpetuate regimes
professedly anti-democratic, but
anti-communist?

Mr. Award states the people of
South Vietnam wish to be free. I
agree fully. They wish to be free
from the Viet Cong. They also wish
to be free from the Americans—free
to pursue their own future wherever
it takes them. We might ask our-
selves: “Who are the real victims
of the Vietnam War? Whose homes
are being bombed and put to fire?
Whose children are being killed and

 

maimed?” Who are these victims:
They are the very Vietnamese whom
we are committed to protect.

The only tyranny with which they
are famiilar is that of war, a relent-
less, brutal war which has never
ceased for a quarter of a century.
Mr. Awad suggests that we can
bring the war to a successful con-
clusion in two years. I’m afraid
that not even the most optimistic
member of the Johnson Administra-
tion entertains such hopes. And so
the malady will linger on, and its
victims will continue to be the
Vietnamese people.

We might ask ourselves: “What
is our aim in Vietnam?” Do we have
a purpose there? Is our aim total
victory over Communists? The John-
son Administration insists that it is
not. Our aim is to force the North
Vietnamese to the conference table
and achieve an “honorable settle-
ment.” It will not be, nor could it
be, a settlement that will insure the
continued independence of South
Vietnam. It will be a settlement that
will afford the United States an al-
ternative to a drastic loss of face.

But is this loss of prestige worth
the loss of perhaps several thou-
sands American lives? Is this vic-

 

Weekly Football Contest

tory, if it can be called that, worth
the complete destruction of a na-

'tion and its people? Do we have

the right to ask the Vietnamese peo-
ple to make further sacrifices that

| will enable us to escape the ignomiy

 

of “retreat”?

Let us heed the advice of Senator
Robert Kennedy. We cannot fight
the promise of a better life which
communism offers the people of
Asia with troops and guns. We must
offer an alternative that will prom-
ise a still better life for the peo-
ple of South Vietnam. We must not
any longer disguise our purpose in
Vietnam by such euphemisms as
“self-determination” and “individual
liberty.”

We are in South Vetnam because
the Johnson Administration believes
that our national interests are being
challenged, because our own defense
is inextricably tied to the perpetua-
tion of an anti-communist regime in
Saigon. And while I do not agree that
our national interest is dependent
upon the successful prosecution of
the war in Vietnam, it is essential
that we, nevertheless, agree on the
reason why we are in Vietnam in
the first place.

Research Fund, established in 1960
through a gift of more than $250,000
from the late Dr. Gustavus Benz

alumnus of the class of 1899. The
fund has been supplemented by other
gifts.

In virtually every case, the work
of the students and their level of
involvement is comparable with
that normally undertaken at the
graduate level in pursuit of ad-
vanced degrees. The close rela-

ssors is similar to that encountered
at the Ph.D. level in graduate
school,

she was not disappointed.

The same young lady also inquired
as to the definition of the term, “liz-

trary to normal taste is not neces-
sarily humorous.)

‘U’ Notices

The number of freshmen receiv-
ing unsatisfactory grades for the
first six weeks of the semester is
slightly higher than last year, ac-
cording to figures released by Dean
Atwood’s office Thursday.

One hundred and one members
of the class of '69 received one or
more notices, which represent a
grade of F or F-plus in the work
of the course to date. This is an in-
crease of five over last year; how-
ever, the total number of U reports
given declined slightly, from 122 in
1964 to 119 this year.

This year’s total is the lowest since
1962, when 115 were given to only 85
students. In addition, this year’s class
has fewer members who received one
or more of the dreaded U’s than any
group of freshmen on record. Twelve
students were saddled with two
apiece and three were unsatisfactory
in three courses.

A breakdown of the courses in
which the notices were given shows
a huge increase in the number
awarded in the physical sciences,
Chemistry accounted for the largest
number with 24, an increase of nine
over last year. The geology depart-
ment gave out 14 as compared with
four in 1964; biology doubled its total
from nine to 18; and physics was re-
sponsible for 11 as opposed to only
three last year.

It is noteworthy that the total
given in 1964 in the sciences was
abnormally low compared with other
years. This semester’s total of 67 is
still an inerease of seven over the
previous high, set in 1963, however.

The figures for other subjects show
a corresponding drop, with the ex-
ception of Latin, up two to six; and
Greek, which remains steady with
one. Of the other language depart-
ments, German gave out ten as op-
posed to 17 last year; French de-
clined from ten toe three; and Span-
ish accounted for one lone U, after
awarding three in 1964.

Sixteen unsatisfactory reports
were were turned in in mathematics,
a decline of seven from last year
History recorded the greatest pro-
portional drop as the department
gave out only seven U's after be-
stowing 24 last year.

 

Novelis

In his lecture last Tuesday night
David Stacton said that the author
needs two basic qualities in order
to achieve success. He needs to have
an experience of life and a control
of the language. Yet even if these
qualities are obtained the author still
confronts certain booby traps.

Mr. Stacton is well qualified to
speak on the qualities an author
needs and the pitfalls he encoun-
ters, since he has written novels,
short stories, verse, biography and
history. Besides being a Glasgow
Visiting Professor, he has held a
Guggenheim Fellowship. His books
are Ride a Tiger (biography), The
World on the Last Day (history), An
Unfamiliar Country (verse); and

In an unannounced poil taken of
50 students in Prof. Martin Merson's
Political Science 101 and 211 classes
Wednesday, October 20, a strong, al-
most unanimous trend supporting
the right to protest up to the point

The poll was conducted by Prof

encounters is what to say and then
how to say it. As Stacton said in his
lecture, “If you are going to build
a bridge, you have to know what it
is for and where to put it.” From
these two basic problems stem all
the other problems that an author
encounters.

The worst difficulty an author
faces is the problem of relating his
material to the real world of the
20th century. In terms of this criti-
cism, said Stacton, Patrick White is

in terms of his age.

The author should stay away from ,
abstractions since he wants to report |

The Student Union Committee yesterday announced a pro-

facilities.

Dean Edward C. Atwood, chairman of the committee, em-
phasized that all plans must be considered as no more than
tentative at the present time, but that the committee had agreed

upon a list of desirable

by the subcommittee.

The following proposals will be
under consideration by the subcom-
mittee for the next two weeks:

The position of permanent Student

66 Recipients
Of Lee Grants

Announced

The recipients of this year’s Robert

E. Lee Research Grants have been
announced by Dean William W.
Pusey. A total of 66 students have
been named to work on 51 different
projects under the supervision of
faculty members. The purpose of the
grants, established in 1950, is to give
the students a chance to participate
in independent research and to de-
velop closer relationships with fac-
ulty members.

In the field of chemistry, Jack Ap-
plefeld and Jeff Kugel will study the
effects of certain agricultural chem-
icals on the amino acid and flavonid
complement of selected plants; John
Burk will attempt to seperate and
identify the organic compounds in
sweat samples taken from cystic
fibrosis patients; and Phil Manor and
Robert Utley will make difiusion
studies on zine and cadmium.

Also in chemistry, Neil Jespersen '
will study oridation-reduction reac-

tions in absolute methanol; Skip
Davidson will do research on the
seperation of inorganic electrolytes
by electrophoresis; Bill Hartman wil!

Machlup
“Liberalism and Freedoms”

Fritz Machlup
PBK Economist,
Here Monday

One of the nation’s leading au-
thorities on economics will visit
Washington and Lee Monday and
Tuesday to speak and meet with stu-
dents.

Dr. Fritz Machlup, Professor of
Economics and International Finance
at Princeton University, will discuss
“Liberalism and the Choice of Free-
doms” Monday evening at 7:30 in
Lee Chapel. Dr. Griffith of the Com-
merce School, which sponsoring
the visit in conjunction with the
Visiting Scholars program of Phi
Beta Kappa, commented that Dr
Machlup’s topic will be of interest
not only to students of economics
but to those of political science, law,
history and many other fields.

Dr. Machlup was born in Austria
in 1902 and received his Ph.D. from
the University of Vienna at the age

Apathy

Surprise! Surprise! May wonders never cease.

Behold, a new realization has emerged from the murky
depths of student mystique. It has been discovered, that, con-
trary to majority opinion, the student body (a percentage
anyway) of Washington and Lee can actually see past the red
brick and white columns. Yes, its true, considerations and prob-
lems other than drink, flicks, women and conventional dress
enter into their thoughts.

One could go so far as to state that these same students
are aware of the world situation, and even concerned with it.
Furthermore, it has been displayed that serious thought has
been applied to such worldly matters.

The source of this great discovery is the poll taken by
Professor Martin Merson in his Political Science 101 and 211
classes last Wednesday. In this unannounced poll, he probed
the students’ views on essential issues now poised concerning
U.S. involvement in Vietnam, the right to protest, and a citi-
zen’s duty to his country.

The results shattered theories of student apathy and ignor-
ance. Within the five minutes allowed for each student to ex-
press his views, each one displayed a familiarity and concern
over these issues. The poll showed that the students were cog-
nizant of recent developments in the war and their many impli-
cations. Many of them showed immediate concern over the
importance of the conflict in balance of international power
They correlated the outcome with its future effects upon the
United States and eventually themselves.

Several went beyond the superficial and pointed out the
relationship between the Vietnam protest marches and those of
Civil Rights groups. They showed how civil disobedience dis-
played by the Civil Rights marches served as a precedent for
similar methods by the Vietnam protesters.

In evaluating the protests, no one challenged the right to
protest, but each questioned the impact of such demonstrations
upon the war. Several spoke against the protests on the grounds
that they encouraged the enemy. They declared that such
demonstrations might lead the enemy to believe that the cit-
izenry of U.S. did not support the war and desired for United
States withdrawal of forces. Such a misconception would ob-
viously destroy any possibility of negotiation.

All of the above is significant in ascertaining student senti-
ment. It shows a student commitment to freedom of speech—
to a limit. The poll also displayed a deep sense of duty to the |
country. However, more significant than any of the above, the
poll proved that the students ARE aware, ARE concerned,
and ARE constantly thinking about the world situation.

The watchword for today’s educa-
tion is “the well-rounded man,” a
man who is abreast with the latest
in science and technology, and yet
also can live in a society of people,
with their culture, arts, and histories.
And a W&L man should (and will!)
have as fine a social education as he
may obtain an academic education if
he so applies himself. What W&L
needs is more freedoms, to produce a
better educated man, a man better
suited through his experiences with
the acceptance of responsibility while
in an environment of learning, to
find his way in life with people.

 

Conventional Dress

I firmly believe that this view of
conventional dress is held by the
vast majority of the student body. I
have enough faith in the individuals
here to believe that the tradiiton of
conventional dress will continue on
a self enforced basis. It will continue
with or without future prods from
Dr. Cole and in spite of Tyler and

Since its debut in 1958, the en-

performance at the Phillips Mem-

ated the words “a quartet whose
art is extraordinary.” Commenda-
tion was forthcoming again and
again as the group fulfilled some
twenty-five engagements in the
mid-West during 1962 and 1963.

Protesting Exclusion
Of Frosh Prrents

Trespass Warrents Urged
To Ban Partying Townies
In Other IFC Action

By STEVE SAUNDERS
News Editor

A resolution deploring the exclu-
sion of freshmen’s parents from
Parents Weekend was passed unan-
imously at last night’s IFC meting.
Addressed to the Parents’ Advisory
Council, which is scheduled to meet
here on Friday, the resolution
pledged to assist in finding some so-
lution to the problem.

The University said that the new
policy was prompted by insufficient
sleeping and eating facilities.

Cannon Offers Motion

Billy Cannon, IFC vice-president,
headed a committee appointed pre-
viously to formulate such a resolu-
tion. Almost all fraternities expressed
dissatisfaction with the new policy.
Most felt that it was important for
the freshmen parents to see their
sons’ fraternities first-hand, and to
learn more about life at Washing-
ton and Lee.

There was some discussion prior to
last night's meeting about the possi-
bility of separate Parents’ Weekends
for each of the four classes, such as
is the practice at Randolph-Macon
and other schools.

The resolution passed last night's
meeting without discussion.

Right Direction
Parents’ Advisory Council
will consider the IFC resolution
when it meets at the end of this
week. Some form of reaction is ex-
pected. Cannon noted, in presenting
his motion, that the University ad-
ministration is not intractable, and
is “willing to move in the right di-
rection in future years, in fullest
cooperaton with the students.”

Rowdy Townies

A solution to the problem of
townies invading fraternity house
parties on weekends was offered by
Barry Vaught, Town Relations
Chairman. Vaught suggested in the
form of a motion that all eighteen
fraternities, acting in unison, pr-
chase general trespass warrants pro-
hibiting certain known “party-

Puvities. The Parents’ Advisory Coun-

cil will consider including fresh-
man parents in next year’s weekend.

The overcrowding of local hotels
and motels necessitated this change.
Some parents are staying as far away
as Buena Vista and Natural Bridge
for the coming weekend.

University officials expect that 334
sets of parents and 103 guests will
be in Lexington for at least part of
the weekend. In past years attend-
ance has ben high as 1200 people.

Friday Activity

The activities began Friday morn-
ing with a registration period from
10 to 12. Registration takes place

quested to talk to their instructors
regarding a time for the appoint-
ment. Conferences are usually of
a 10-15 minute duration.

The Parents’ Advisory Council
mets at 2:30 Friday to discuss plans
for next year. The Council is com-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

Tuesday Edition

In The Shadows Too Long

One of the most controversial aspects of the University
Self-Study Program is the evaluation of the McCormick Li-
brary. It is the policy of the Self-Study Committee to release
very little, if indeed any, information regarding findings or
recommendations of the Library Committee. Unfortunately, all
too little is known about the financial resources or actual con-
tent of our library.

 

 

Release Survey

In an attempt to shed some light on the relative merits of
the library, the Ring-tum Phi plans to publish a heretofore ob-
scure survey taken last fall in the spirit of the self-study pro-
gram of evaluation. The poll involving a representative number
of institutions of comparable size and background contains a
number of vital statistics which invariably place our library near
the bottom.

We will be the first to admit that statistics do not tell the
whole story about this or any other library. Numerical con-
tent is only one criterion by which the adequacy or inadequacy
of a library should be judged. Nevertheless, we do feel that
the survey is of general interest to the student body, and par-
ticularly pertinent to the uninformed critic of the library.

There seems to be some reluctance on the part of those in
possession of the report to release it at this time, but we should
like to point out that rumors concerning the existence of such
report and its content are widespread. In the interests of clarity
we urge that the paranoia which has surrounded this report
from the beginning be alleviated, and that a careful and dispas-
sionate appraisal be rendered.

Unhealthy and Archaic

Constructive criticism must be taken in the spirit in which it
is offered. It is somewhat distressing to note that those persons
responsible for this survey have been persuaded that it would
be unwise to promote its general circulation at this time. This
seems to indicate a certain stigma attached to the preparation
of any disconcerting survey pertaining to our academic com-
munity. Obviously, this is a most unhealthy climate if, indeed,
it is typical, and we can only lament the continued existence
of these archaic attitudes.

The final report of the Self-Study Program will not be
presented until the fall of 1966. In the meantime, we trust that
the University will eliminate the aura of secrecy surrounding
the entire effort.

 

Requiescat In Pace

It decayed last Fall. It failed last Winter. It withered last
Spring. And this October, it appears that the speaking tradi-
tion—one of warmest characteristics of Washington and Lee—
has finally died.

What can be said in obituary? What sort of funeral oration
is in order?

Tradition, Speaking. Aged 100 years. Died of severe ne-
glect, compounded by gradual paralysis and a near-unanimous
disconcern. Speaking will repose in the pages of the University
catalogue where the friends he never had in life may now safely
pay their respects. He is survived by Conventional Dress, and
mourned by 20,000 living alumni and faculty. The family re-
quests that flowers be omitted.

The symptoms of Speaking’s final illness were easily rec-
ognizable. They could be noticed every morning when a fresh-
man didn’t speak to another student, or worse, when he did and
was greeted by a humilating silence. They could be detected
when professors were reluctant to walk around campus during

period changes, for fear of having their “Good Mornings” re- |

turned with an icy stare, or at best a growled and grudging mon-
osyllable. It could be plainly seen when alumni would return
home after visits to Lexington, mildly horrified and personally
hurt by the studied indifference and seeming discourtesy of his
school’s students.

It could be seen, detected, and noticed by anybody con-
cerned enough to open his ears, and it could have been correct-
ed by anyone with sense enough to open his mouth, and speak.
But it wasn’t corrected, and enough mouths weren't opened.

Speaking passed quietly away in the night, with a minimum
of discomfort. Most didn’t even know he had gone; he certainly
wasn't conspicuous by his absence. The Assimilation Committee
didn’t even send their condolences.

Belated tears, and the most convincing sorrow cannot bring
the old Speaking Tradition back. But a new one can be born,
even if it too will someday decay, fail, wither and die, for such is
the nature of tradition, In the meanwhile, we must mourn,
Speaking was an old man and it is sad to see old men die.

By WARD BRIGGS

Richard HI coming to the Lyric is
the third of Olivier’s great Shake-

speare films, His first, Henry V
(1947) ranks as one of the greatest
motion pictures on record, and his
Hamlet (1949) is close behind. This
movie marks the handling of Rich-
ard’s extensive, challenging mono-
logues on the screen.

The handsome, sophisticated
Olivier of Rebecca and Wuthering
Heights now becomes the grotes-
que, hunchback king with a force
comparable only to the Lyric’s
proprietor’s. The color is mag-
nificent as the crowning ceremony
in the vast Catholic cathedral dis-
perses and leaves Richard alone on
the throne to contemplate his reyv-
olution.

Oliver treats the long speeches
with polish and maintains the facial
mobility so necessary in the movies,
but so minor on the stage. This fa-
cial mobility plus the toning of the
voice and staying in one spot for an
extended period of time are just
a few of the many problems Shake-
sperean actors (Richard Burton, for

 

Current Cinema

 

Briggs Praises Olivier's

one) fine so impossible to accom-
modite to in the movies. |

Olivier, probably the greatest |
Shakespearean actor alive, today has
mastered this technique of motion
without movement and amply dem-
onstrates it in this movie.

As with the other two movies,
this one was adopted, produced,
and directed by the star, and a
magnificent job has been done in
all fields. The regular 34% hour
play has been cut to 2 hours with
all the major soliloquies retained.
The sets, both in the interiors
which were shot in a real castle,
and the exteriors which were
filmed on the fields of Lancashire,
Oliver’s camera moves and stands
still with a perfect understanding
of movement within the play.

The final scene with the famous
“A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a
horse” has been the subject of great
discusions among professional Shake-
spearians: Whether it is to take place
with Richard alone on an empty
field of battle or surrounded by
troops in the thick of fighting. Oliver

 

very wisely puts the scene in a little

 

grove away from the battle but with
battle sounds distinetly heard. His
shout falls on no ears, and he seems
caught in his own plan as he has
wandered off on his own junket
leaving the welfare of his men to
chance.

The final death scene is, I be-
lieve, one of the greatest on cel-
luloid, and Oliver uses it to full ad-
vantage to put a fitting end te one
of Shakespeare’s most detestable
heroes. There is no mourning for
him, only a rather quiet gratitude
that this vermin has been removed
from the nation,

Olivier is the classic villain, the
great anti-hero and for many reasons
this is a film which must be seen not
only for the unexeelled acting and
unequalled direction, but the script
is fair, also.

Presently in the works is a black
and white film version of Oliver's
Othello which was a smash on the
the London stage a year ago. I hope
the years have not dulled Olivier’s
talent as a director for they have
surely advanced his reputation as
one of Britain’s greatest actors.

At the present time, Washington
and Lee suffers from the same prob-
lems as the city
of Los Angeles.
Most obvious is
the problem of the
automobile, which
is devouring Los
Angeles and over-
running W&L.
The most serious
common _ prob-
lem though, is
that of a pattern of
growth that has
left both without
a center. Los Angeles has no focus;
its growth is confused and chaotic.

 

 

Los Angeles cannot find itself, the
city is lest in its own jumble.
Lack of Focus

If Les Angeles suffers from ur-
ban sprawl, the W&L version must
be a rural sprawl. One of the great-
est problems of our campus is its
lack of focus. The Washington Col-
lege Group, Newcomb Hall and
Tucker Hall form one long axis. This
is limited on the north end by du-
Pont Hall and is vaguely defined at
the other end by the Freshman
dorms and gym.

There is a natural flow of people
along the major axis, but there is
no cross axis or stopping point to
break this flow. The physical center
of the major axis is Washington Hall,

 

Life-In-Our-Times Department: A Parable

 

By BRUCE W. RIDER
Once upon a time there appeared
on a very small bulletin board at
a very small col

lege a sign.

The sign said
simply, “No
Goats.”

No fuss, no
muss, no noise-

just these two sim-
ple words on a
small piece of
paper on a bulle-
tin board.

It so happened
that in the partie-

 

 

lular kingdom in which this college
was located, the king and his advis-
ors advocated a pro-goat policy. But
it was admitted throughout the realm
that this was a land of freedom, and
that the subjects should be allowed
to express peaceably whatever opin-
| jons they might happen to have.

It was also true that in the vil-
lage where the college was, and in
the college itself, the majority of
the people were pro-goat, and most
of the people preferred quiet ways.
In fact, there was seldom any real
controversy about anything, except
in the rather mild area of apparel:
a few upstarts did not want to wear
the traditional leather suspenders
and some wanted to shed part of
the traditional outer garment. Other-
wise, all was tranquil.

But elsewhere in the kingdom
people had spoken out against the
pro-goat policy of the king,
eventually the issue had made it-
self felt in this isolated little col-
lege in this isolated little town,

Soon after the ‘no goat’ sign ap-
peared, people began to seraw! anon-
ymous obscene phrases upon the
sign. It thus appeared that pro-goat
people were the same

Many people said that of course
they
right to express opinion—but they
certainly did not think that the anti-
goat position should be allowed ex-
pression. After all, there are limits.

situation. He questioned college offi-

find out who the anti-goat people
might be.

 

Students enrolled in the training
for knights were instructed to have |
nothing to do with anti-goatism. And |
students at a nearby knightly acad- |
emy were threatened with dishonor |
and expulsion if they involved them- |
selves with anti-goating.

Truth to tell, a great deal of hate
arose over the little sign.

It is interesting to note that in
anoher kingdom, far, far away, no
one was ever allowed to deviate from
official policy. But in the kingdom
where the college was there had
been a long tradition of freedom of
expression, but in the goat affair it
began to look as though this free-
dom was to be ended. It was said to
be unkingdomly to dissent from the
king's policy.

Burning Draft Card Doesn't Help

W&L And Los Angeles Without A Focal Point;
Student Union Should Be The Rallying Point

but it is not a center in the sense
that people naturally congregate
there; instead they walk on by.
What Washington and Lee needs is
a square or crossing point which
draws people together in their idle
moments, a place in which people
can meet and stop by chance to be
involved in spontaneous exchange of
conversation and ideas. Walking
along the Colonnade at the present
time similar to driving on an
Interstate Highway. There is a min-
imum speed and no place to pause.
What the campus needs is an area
similar to a winding country road,
that invites one to explore and stop
as he desires.

is

Points of Dispersal

The above analysis is a personal
impression of the interaction of peo-
ple on the Washington and Lee cam-
pus. In New York one rallying point
is Washington Square; and in Venice
it is St. Mark’s Square. Here at W&L
we do not have a rallying point:
we have points of dispersal, Doc’s,
the Liquid, the Co-op, the apart-

ments, fraternity houses, and the
dorms.
The answer to the need for an

area of confluence and conversation
is the New Student Union, but al-
ready part of its value is to be di-
minished. The sight is to be off the
center of the campus in a_ place
which draws only a limited portion
of the students and faculty. The
present Co-op, is not a natural gath-
ering point.

Alternative Sites

There appear to be two and pos-
sibly three alternative locations for
the student union, all preferable to
the proposed site. Of primary im-
portance for a site is natural draw-
ing power and convenience. The most
advantageous position would be the

Tyler Defends
U.S. In Current

Defensive War

By ROY TYLER

Victnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Everybody talks about it, but no-
body does anything about it.

Last week I saw a newspaper col-
umn that was quite typical of the
type of column
that has recently
been appearing in
newspapers’ all
over the country.

Essentially what
the columnist was
saying was that
the United States
forces in Vietnam
' are there to pro-
! ™ tect the Vietna-
Tyler mese people, and

all they are ac-
complishing is the murder of inno-
cent women and children, often by
American forces themselves. In the
name of humanity, this column went
on, we should withdraw from Viet-
nam and end this “useless” killing.
Our purpose in Vietnam was to save
the lives of the Vietnamese people,
so why do we stay there and cause
more killing?

 

My answer to this columnist is
that he has completely misjudged
our purpose for remaining in Viet-
nam. We are not in Vietnam, no
matter how cruel it may seem to
some “humanitarian” ears, to merely
protect the Vietnamese people. We
are there to protect the American
people.

There is no reason for the Ameri-
can people to go on kidding them-
selves and the rest of the world. We
are fighting in Vietnam to keep com-
munism from engulfing Southeast
Asia in the interest of the United
States,

Do people actually believe that the
Communists will stop with the
conquest of Vietnam? Are there peo-
ple whe are convinced that we can
withdraw from Vietnam, hide our
heads under a blanket, and pretend
that the communists will not move
further into Southeast Asia?

Isn't it logical that the communist
will continue to take advantage of
the continual withdrawal of Ameri-
can troops?

Those who attempt to analyze the
situation in Vietnam in an attempt to
prove that we cannot possibly help
the Vietnamese people, are continu-
ally complicating a relatively sim-
ple matter. I am not stating that the
Vietnamese war is a simple matter;
I am stating that our objectives are
simple...we must drive the com-
munists out of Vietnam, not merely
because we feel that the Vietnamese
want to do this, but because it
is in our own interest to do so.

When we realize that we are fight-
ing in Vietnam to protect ourselves,
than perhaps misguided young
Americans will eease burning their
draft cards and begin thinking how
they can help themselves by fighting
for their country.

The administration is looking into

er the anti-Vietnam demonstrations
have had any communists involved
in them. Moreover, it continues to
damn any criticism in this area, and
others, as unpatriotic and damaging

The implications of such state-

Fourth Quarter FG Nips Generals, 9-7

U. Defeat

JE FRERET

Perhaps the sweetness of the Guilford victory or perhaps a

light regard for the Western

Maryland team occupied the

minds of the Generals when they played host to the Maryland
club Saturday, but whatever the reason be, the Generals were
rudel yawakened when Paul McClintock, a 200 pound senior,

kicked a 30 yard field goal with 1:446*—

left in the game to provide the visi-
tors with their margin of victory in
handing W&L a 9-7 defeat.

The Generals started where they
had left off Guilford the
week before by marching 51 yards
to score the first time they got the
ball. Bryant Kendrick, calling only
on his backfield grind out the
yardage, sent fullback John Anthony
over left tackle from 5 yards out
to put up the first points on the
scoreboard. Skip Jacobsen then con-
verted the extra point, and W&L
led, 7-0. But this was to be the ex-
tent of the Generals’ offense as they
could not generate anything resem-
bling a drive for the rest of the day.

against

to

An example of their inability to
control the ball and march for a
score came after Starke Sydnor
blocked a Western Maryland punt
following W&L’'s touchdown to
give the Generals the ball on the
visitors’ 30 yard line, Unable to
move, the Generals relinquished
the ball on downs.

Noteworthy the Washington
and Lee defense, which had its back
on the goal line just before the half
ended following a_ blocked
Smith punt. Western Maryland
marched to the W&L two yard line
where it had first and goal. A penalty
moved the ball to the one, but the
offensive efforts were repulsed by
the Generals’ staunch defense. West-
ern Maryland was foreed to give up
the ball on the two yard line on
downs

Western Maryland started the sec-
ond half by marching to a first down
on W&L’s 6 vard line. Three plays
netted four yards and on fourth
down and two to go for the touch-
down Smith blitzed through his de-
fensive wingback position to spill the
s, giving W&L
possession of the football

Late in the third quarter Western
Maryland began to march again, and
the quarter terminated with the visi-
tors on the W&L 16 yard line. On
the first play of the fourth quarter,
Western Maryland quarterback
Grayson Winterling, the fourth man
to try to take the visitors to a score,

two point conversion was unsuc-|
cessful, and Jacobsen’s placement

began to grow in importance as the

time ticked away

Then late in the game Western
Maryland began to eat up yard-
age in a last ditch drive for a
touchdown and victory. With
fourth down and four on the W&L
13 vard line and 1:46 showing on
the clock, the visitors called on

‘Swan Calls It Wat |
As Frosh Lose 2nd |

Most people call it football, but
| Coach Dana Swan calls it war when!
|speaking of Friday’s game played |
between the Washington and Lee |
Brigadiers and Fork Union Military
Academy. He said that the Generals
fought hard but lost because of de-
fensive lapses, as FUMA was victor-
ious, 18-8.

The big difference in the game was
FUMA’s ability to come up with the
big play. The decisive touchdown
came after W&L had failed to hold
the hosts on a fourth and nine siuta-
tion. Until that point the Generals
had led, 8-6.

The Brigadiers’ lone tally had
come late in the second period when
they had recovered a FUMA fumble
on the home club’s 15 yard line.
Charlie Freret carried 12 yards to
the three, and then Dee Cannon went
over the middle three plays later for
the score. Quaterback Alan Tomlin
passed to Freret for the two points,
and W&L led 8-6 at the half.

FUMA scored early in the third
| quarter and again in the fourth. Lack
je depth hurt the Brigadiers as sev-
| eral players were injured in the first
| half. Swan noted John Wolf, Rein
Fischer and Mark Heatwole for good
play on defense. Cannon, Tomlin,
and halfback Jeb Brown paced the
offense .Brown was injured, leaving |
the game with a split lip.

Friday the Generals entertain
the Bridgewater J.V. in Lexington. |
The Eagles are 0-1, while the Briga-
diers are even for four games.

Gains Revenge
In 2-1 Game

On a weekend sojourn to the Big
City of the Birds and the Beagles,
the soccer team of Washington and
bent revenge, nipped the
American University Eagles in a
close contest, 2-1. Last year it was at
the hands of American U. that the
Generals’ six game victory streak
was broken.

Lee, on

During the first half of the game,
the W&L eleven was held scoreless
by the opposition. The field was wet,
;and the rainy cold weather bogged
|down the attacks of both squads.
| However, the Eagles managed to
| score their first and only goal of the
game, and the score was 1-0 against
the Generals at the midway point.

 

Initial Score

In the third period the Washing-
ton and Lee team rallied for its ini-
tial score and locked the score at
1-1. The tally was made on a well
directed corner kick by senior co-
captain Tim Henry that was headed
into the goal by Dave Kirkpatrick.

As American U. was held scoreless
the entire second half, W&L receiv-
ed the decisive goal in the final
period on a penalty kick by Henry.
With this kick, Henry increased his
tem-leading total of goals to seven
and enabled the Generals to obtain
their fourth win of the season
opposed to three defeats.

A Fine Team Effort

This game represented a fine team

Special recognition goes to sopho-
more fullbacks Richard Burroughs
and Bob Smith, who did well in the
absence of the team’s ace defensive
back, co-captain Dave Redmond, who
was sidelined by a _ back injury.
Futhermore, Fred Skinner with his
excellent ball control and Henry with
his seoring ability on display were
integral parts of the victorious ef-
iort

The third alternative is the vacant

more convenient, but it does offer
room for future expansion and does
not promise to destroy the very hu-

The above analysis and proposals
place greater emphasis on human
values and considerations rather than
on questions of money and ease of
construction. I believe this should be
the proper emphasis in all buildings,
especially at Washington and Lee.
Here buildings are slow in realiza-

temporary solutions which become
permanent problems.

do it. Finally he pointed out that
liberals, who were traditionally tol-
erant to opposing views, in defend-
ing their own beliefs, became less so
and actually tended toward social-
ism.

Dr. Machlup went on to discuss
seven fundamental errors often made
concerning freedom. First is the con-
fusion of “freedom to” with “freedom
from.” He pointed out that “freedom
from” means “absence of” and is
not strictly speaking, a freedom.
Next, there is the previously men-
tioned confusion between “I may”
and “I can.” A third error is in the
idea that it is always the state which
interferes with freedom. He went
on to discus that it is not true that
freedom can be secured only by the
state.
He also stated that freedom is not,

many believe, the absence of
coercion. For, he said, there must be
state coercion to put down those who
would restrict freedom.

as

Dr. Machlup then discussed poli-
tical ,intellectual and moral, and
economic fredoms. Of particular
note, he pointed out that the fight of
revolution, which was so staunchly
defended by our forefathers such as
Jefferson, and Lincoln, has fallen in-
to great disfavor in modern society.

bate than any other topic this fall. However, for observers
close to the University, the lack of issues for discussion so far
this year is alarming.

This was to be the year of the “progressive” Executive
Committee, a rejuvenated Interfraternity Council, an inquisi-
tive Self-Study Committee, an exciting Class of 69. Something
is missing, however. Gone are the days of the “issue-makers’”—
the Lamar Lamb’s, the Steve Smith’s, and the Tracy Harring-
ton’s.

For quite some time, students have
complained bitterly about having
to go to classes on Saturday morn-

answered definitely at this time.
There are many possibilities of new
schedule workings. The planning

would take a great deal of time—so

much time, in fact, that if the de-
cision to abolish Saturday classes
were reached, a_ five-day week

reached, a five-day week would not
go into effect until next year or pos-
sibly even the year after.
Five-day Week Suggestions
It is safe to assume, however, that
much of the following would be in-
volved in a five-day week.

1. Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday clas-
ses might be extended to an hour
and a half, and be held only on
Tuesday and Thursday. This means
that students would go to classes
on Tuesday and Thursday up un-
til four or five o’clock in the af-
ternoon. There is also a possibility
that some students would have
classes in the afternoon on Mon-
day-Wednesday-Friday, but it
probable the M-W-F classes would
remain the same as now, depend-
ing on what the students
take and when they meet.

2.There is a possibility that some
classes would meet only two hours
a week and consequently only two
hours’ credit would given.
Likewise, some classes might meet
five hours a week, etc. This, how-
ever, is highly improbable.

would be for all students and the

Of course, these changes are not
definite. No schedule changes can be
worked out until the type of system
that is chosen can be itself worked
out. But these changes do give one
an idea of the kind of things that

can be expected from a five-day
week.

Advantages
There are, of course, advantages |?

and disadvantages concerning a five-
day week. Some of the advantages
are as follows.

student or professor has a
great deal of research work to do,
he may use Saturday morning to
do it. He can easily travel to the
University of Virginia or to any
other school to make use of their
facilities.

.Many students would concentrate

and study harder during the week
knowing that they have a day off
at the end of the week. As it is
now, students have only Saturday
afternoon and night off. On Sun-
day, students must begin prepar-
ing for Monday.

sports, as far as getting to foot-
ball games, the six-day week is
close to ridiculous. For the student
who gets out of class at one
o'clock, running to his room, tak-

and probably having to pick up his
date, getting to the game at two

25-year A ward |

Two men associated with Wash-
ington and Lee University have been
honored with nominations from their
alma maters for this year’s Sports
Illustrated Silver Anniversary All-
American Awards.

A. T. Bishop, Jr., a 1941 graduate
of Washington and Lee, and Lee M.
McLaughlin, a graduate of the Uni-
versity of Virginia of the same year,
are among 64 candidates—all cited
for their exceptional success in life
25 years since their senior collegiate
football season of 1940.

Bishop was an »utstanding full-
back for Washington and Lee and
earned three varsity letters at that
position. While studying at the Uni-
versity, he was chosen for member-
ship in Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron
Delta Kappa, national honorary aca-
demic and leadership societies, re-
spectively, and Beta Gamma Sigma,
national honorary commerce society.
He also served as president of Al-
pha Tau Omega, national social
fraternity.

All-State

McLaughlin won All-State honors
while at the University of Virginia
and subsequently played a year of
professional football with the Green
Bay Packers. He then served with
the United States Navy as a com-
mander of a minesweeper which par-
ticipated in all the major invasions
of the southern European theater.

'

After ten years of high school
coaching at Episcopal High School in
Alexandria, McLaughlin undertook

the rebuilding of Washington and
Lee's football program in 1957. Serv-
ing as head coach, he led his team to
a perfect 910 season in 1961 and as a
result, Washington and Lee
named the outstanding small college
team of the year by the Washington,
D.C., Touchdown Club

Bishop participated in both World
War II and the Korean conflict and
has built an enviable sales record in
a number of farm equipment com-
panies. He has recently formed his
own distributing firm
based in his home Louis-
ville, Kentucky

Tomorrow

Eagle defense has leaked a goodly
number of touchdowns to the oppo-
sition, many of those points can be
credited to an offense that has lost
the ball deep in its own territory.
Frequently interceptions have been
run back for touchdowns.

Bridgewater’s offense usually
doesn’t go. Quarterback Butch Mar-
vel, number 19, paces their many
variations of T formation, with a
widely split line and flanking ends
and halfbacks. An outstanding half-
back in the person of Yeager Marks
leads the ground gaining attack,
Marvel handles the passing. He
sticks mainly to the short “look-in”
passes but is capable of throwing the
bomb occasionally. His top receiver
is Bob Baker, an end with an ex-
tremely good pair of hands.

In opposing Bridgewater this week,
W&L plans to play 60 minutes of
dedicated football in an attempt to
eliminate the erratic football played

FREE BOOK COVERS

William Shakespeare’s undiscovered epic, “Queen Alexandra
and Murray;’ was unearthed a few years ago by a man who
claimed to be 2,000 years old, Passages were quoted, and
scholars were sent to work. Subsequently, the Onomotopaeiac
Society of America camped on the site of a Renaissance
street theatre, and while digging the scene, a ghostly figure
emerged.

It spoke in a voice not unlike Margaret Rutherford’s saying:
“What ho, students! Get ye to a nvsrchant who peddles ye
olde phonographe discs. Find ye my picture, and hold it next
thy books. Fame and fortune wait without!”

Or—why don’t you pop for some pop art book covers? Avail-
able at your friendly record peddler’s shoppe!

(And, unless you're a loser, you'll! check out the lineup
of Capitol records, too! That means the Beatles, The
Beach Boys, The Lettermen, The Seekers and so on!)

800 Parents At Weekend;
Hear Reports In Lee Chapel

‘Advisory Council
Elects Officers

By JAY THIEMEYER

This year the Parents’ Weekend

|Committee arranged accommodations
_| for only the top three forms of W&L

parents and with this smaller group,
two-thirds of last
1200, the committee was able
to present a more intense, informa-
tive schedule.

On Friday afternoon the Parents’
Advisory Council convened to han-
dle several issues and to elect of-
ficers for the session of 1966-67. The
result of their deliberation was first
to approve the IFC resolution that
freshman parents should be included
in the Parents’ Weekend of 1966 and
that accommodations for parents
should be left up to the students; and
second, to elect the following of-
ficers:

Chairman—Mr. William Ingles,
White Marsh, Va.; Co-Chairmen
Mr. Richard Holladay, Memphis,
Tenn.; Dr. Ward Briggs, Montchan-
in, Del.; and Judge C. E. Long, Dal-
las, Tex

On Friday evening, the parents at-
tended faculty-student panel on
“Changing Student Values at Lee

Tuesday Edition

Library Report Unavatlable

Once again the crusading efforts of the Ring-tum Phi have
been thwarted by the omnipotent bureaucratic hierarchy of
Washington and Lee. Last week we made reference to an ob-
scure but relatively harmless report dealing with our library
and its resources. Since that time we have been unable to ob-
tain a copy of the report for publication. Both the chairman
of the Library Committee, Dr. Allen W. Moger, and the chair-
man of the English Department, Dr. Severn Duvall, from
whose department the report originated refused to “promote
its general circulation at this time.”

At the risk of sounding repetitive, we feel a brief explana-
tion of the report and its origin is in order. The survey was
conducted by two members of the English Department who
were concerned with certain gaps in the library in the field
of English. Thus, a questionnaire dealing with such items as
the ratio of books to students and budgetary allocations was
formulated and sent to a representative number of institutions
with which Washington and Lee is often compared. Among
these schools were Oberlin, Davidson, Williams, Amherst, and
Trinity.

The conclusion which the report contained was that Wash-
ington and Lee must increase its spending significantly in this
area if it intends to maintain its academic reputation. Admit-
tedly, this was not the first time that such a discovery had been
announced, and yet it was regarded as an insult to the foresight
and sound judgment of the Library Committee. Quite obvious-
ly, this was not the intention of those responsible for the survey,
although it was in this spirit that the report was received.

 

After a fairly extensive investigation of the entire matter,
certain facts have come to light which deserve further com-
ment. In the first place the whole issue has unfortunately be-
come infused with personality conflicts. It is somewhat appalling
that sincere concern for library facilities has been attacked on
an ad hominem basis. The issues and not personalities should
be the subject of any enlightened discussion within the aca-
demic community, whether it pertains to the library, or the
curriculum, or whatever.

The manner in which the Library Committee dealt with the
report from the beginning indicates a break down of communi-
cations and a lack of mutual respect. Since the report was pre-
pared by two “freshmen” faculty members it was regarded as
somewhat presumptuous and naive by more experienced mem-
bers of the faculty. Perhaps this accounts for the fact that, al-
though the report was submitted last fall, action by the Library
Committee was delayed until last spring. At this time a copy of
it was circulated to each member of the committee. Discus-
sion of the report never took place, and the final report of the
Library Committee submitted to the Self-Study Committee
did not respond to the report at all.

Early this fall a member of the Library Committee who was
unavoidably absent from the spring meetings and who was
particularly concerned with the omission of the report from the
final recommendations of the committee, addressed a letter to
the chairman in which he expressed the desire to reopen the
hearings on the entire matter. On the basis of this communica-
tion and the recommendations of the self-study analysts, the
Library Committee decided to study the report in a session later
this fall.

At this time the Library Committee still has not acted on
the report, but it is scheduled for discussion early this month.
We fail to understand why criticism which is informative and
constructive has been the object of scorn and ridicule. The in-
tent of the report was not to indict or expose, but simply to
contribute to the over-all evaluation of the library, The events
surrounding this whole incident have certainly inhibited the
natural spontaneity of the self-study, and at the same time
alienated the younger wing of the faculty.

We deplore the seeming inability of certain elements of the
faculty to maintain an open dialogue on the relative merits of
this or any similar report without allowing personal antagon-
isms to cloud the issue. In the light of recent publicity we feel
sure that the report will be given an adequate hearing, but, un-
fortunately, the price may be a permanent split in the Library
Committee. It is, indeed, a sad commentary on our faculty if
this incident can in any sense be described as characteristic of
our institution

s Arguments As Unrealistic

Saunders Opposes Abolition of Saturday Classes

By STEVE SAUNDERS

Most arguments against Saturday
classes don’t merely deteriorate af-
ter intensive examination—they dis-
integrate. It is a rare and artless
brand of sophistry which character-
izes most of the proposas to eliminate
Saturday classes. The lack of ration-
al reasons for abolition, other than
vague appeals for “research time”
(i.e. extended road trips), make the
current dialogue not only unproduc-
tive, but downright ludicrous. We
must look deeper than rationalizing
platitudes.

With the EC poll on the subject
of Saturday classes scheduled for
next Wednesday, it is now more ap-
propriate than ever to intensively
examine the case against Saturday
classes—and watch it disintegrate.

The first impulse on the part of
anyone who has ever started the
weekend too soon and too fast and
and been made to endure the
cruel, throbbing consequences of
an early morning Saturday class, is
to wote for abolition (more than
ones if possible), This rather basic
reaction might make the vote
agaimst Saturday classes almost
unanimous, It is because of this

¥

 

SATURDA
MoRMINGS..--

common prejudice that we are ob-
ligated to at least attempt a dis-
passionate view of the of the prob-
lem.

Those justifications for abolition
revolving around sympathetic treat-
ment of students who want to take
more long road trips but don’t have
enough cuts, are sheer nonsense and
must be discounted. Likewise, the
arguments favoring a “full week-
end” and “more feedom” don’t hold
water,

The problem of athletes missing
classes is valid, and abolition would
solve it. However, increased attend-
ance at athletic events because of
no Saturday classes is both invalid
and unlikely. Students who don’t
support their team now are not going
to start attending if Saturday classes
are abolished. By the same token,
I doubt if anyone is going to travel
to see away games if Saturday morn-
ings are free.

Similarly, the abolition of week-
end classes will neither gain nor
lose prospective W&L applicants.
Most students don’t worry about
Saturday classes until they get here;

 

One argument has at least the
veneer of legitimacy: additional
time for faculty and student re-
search, But how much time does
this consume, and with what fre-
quency? How often do teachers
and students feel constrained to go
to U.Va. for research? Maybe a
handful, once in a while. Concern-
ed as we are with the greatest
good for the greatest number, this
must also be rejected. Not enough
people have this need to warrant
as great an upheaval as abolition of
Saturday classes would involve,

A tangentia consideration is the
disinclination of many professors to
lecture on Saturday; it is an adverse
working condition to many. But this
is for the faculty itself to determine,
not the student body.

 

What would be some of the side-
effects of a 5-day week? Among |
them, almost surely, would be
professorial tendency to assign more |
work over the weekend, because of |
the additional time available to the |
student. More research paper would |
be the order of the day since addi-|

Schedule conflicts would be le-

of the reasons we have a 6-day
week now is to make maximum
use of campus academic facilities,
In the foreseeable future, therefore,
a new and expensive program will
be required. The huge expense,
too large to be handled by the
University’s present endowment,
would in turn raise tuition fees.
Abolition of Saturday classes might
lose the University prospective
students in this case, rather than
encourage them.

Many have in the past pointed to
the example of Randolph-Macon as
a prime example of the practicability
and desirability of a shortened
week. However, these pro-

be

| ponents of abolition usually neglect

to mention that the Randolph-Macon
girls have a four-day week leaving
Wednesday free as a “reading day.”
If abolition were achieved, uneven

| distribution of classes—and the load

of class-work—would eliminate all
similarities in spirit and effect to the
Randoph-Macon system.
Alternatives to Saturday classes
have been suggested. Among these
are plans for 90-minute classes on
‘Tuesday and Thursday, thus distrib-
uting the time usually spent on
Saturday classes. This would create
problems of student sleeping, dood-
ling, and paralysis during these mar-

'athon classes. Lethargy would be-

come part of every class syllabus.
Also, teachers would hard put to
organize two sets of lecture notes for
each course. Other possible substi-

| tutes include two-hour credit cours-

es, accompanied by a complete over-
haul of the present grading, sched-

uling, and credit systems; and,
afternoon classes.
A reasonable compromise would

Student Body
Is Responsible

By BOB LEE

In Friday's Ring-tum Phi, an edi-
torial lamenting the passing from
the Washington and Lee campus of
the great issue-makers Messrs.
Harrington, Lamb and Smith. What
the editorial was in fact grieving was
the “oppressive” absence of legiti-
mate debate and protest at Washing-
ton and Lee.

It seems that there is no great
cause with which the typical stu-
dent might identify himself and
through which he might assert his
self-identity. But isn't there a par-
adox implicit in thse lamentations?
Why should we be disturbed by
the absence of debate? Doesn't the
very absence of debate presuppose
the elimination and resolution of
injustice and conflict? And doesn't
this imply that Washington and
Lee is a veritable utopia, whose
every aspect is above reproach,
of this is nonsense. But
how explain the almost
complete absence of controversy at
Washington and Lee? Does the fault
lie with those most specifically re-
sponsible for stimulating public dis-
cussion and or does it lie
with an indifferent and “diffident”
student body? I imagine that blame
must be attributed to both.

The columnist cannot invent or
draw attention to existing sources
of conflict, But there are numer-
ous areas of potential debate, not
the least of which is conventional
dress. Unfortunately, however, the
columnists whose responsibility is
to clarify the issue appear to de-
rive greater satisfaction in obscur-
ing the issue in a deluge of per-
sonal insult and abuse. Whatever
value might have been realized is
now forfeited. and the whole ques-
tien of conventional dress becomes

Led by the hard running of soph-

half as they rolled over Bridgewater,
41-13, on the loser’s field.
Bridgewater put the first points
on the scoreboard when Eagle Ron
Glascow plunged 1 yard for the
touchdown. Myers’ placement made
it 7-0. But Washington and Lee came
back to score two touchdowns before
the half, one on a four yard run by
John Anthony and the second on a
13 yard run by McDavid to take
a 12-7 lead at the halfway point.
W&L took the second half kickoff
and marched to the Eagles 33 yard
line where they were halted and had
to settle for a 43 yard field goal by
Skip Jacobsen to up the score 15-7,
On the following kickoff the home
crowd was brought to its feet
Terry Westhafer raced 87 yards
down the sidelines to close the gap
to 15-13. The Eagles bid for a two
point conversion was thwarted, and
W&L’s lead was preserved.
Bloom to Reading
It was then that the roof fell in on
Bridgewater for on the ensuing kick-
off the Eagles fumbled and W&L
recovered. Andy Bloom, taking full
advantage of this miseue, lofted a
pass good for 20 yards to Rob Read-
ing to increase W&L’s lead by six
points. Jacobsen added the extra
point, and the score became 22-7,
Once again W&L kicked off and true

Vietnam Situation Analyzed

(Continued from page 2)
ingful commentary on the Vietnam
situation that I have found. History
and fate have put the United States
in Vietnam. If the U.S. had foreseen
its present position when its first
commitments were being considered,
our policy may well have been dif-
ferent. The temptation to ignore our
presence in Vietnam is evident in
every cry for withdrawal. But this
opportunity is not to be had. It is
effectively impossible for the U.S. to
withdraw at this stage of the war.

The US. claims to be fighting in
behalf of the Vietnamese people
whose “government” has requested
our aid. Vietnam has had so many
governing regimes that the people
probably don’t know who their gov-
ernment is. It is also doubtful that
the Vietnamese regime would stand
were it not for our soldiers, not to
speak of our aid money and weap-
ons. Even if a truce is achieved, there

is no guarantee of stable govern-
ment in Vietnam.
There is danger that the United

States will begin to believe the myths
it ereates to conceal the truth with
the result that no truth can be

Referendum of 1933. We must con- |
sider carefully what abolition will |
mean, and examine what we value |
most. We must view the problem as
it is, and not in the terms of sugar- |
coated substitutes such as aad

support for athletics.”

We cannot afford to be misled; es
pecially not by ourselves. It would
be so easy just to vote for abolition |
next Wednesday. But do not forget
that it was just as easy to vote “Ja”
in 1933, and just as easy to
“Yes” in 1964. Think before you vote
“Yes” on November 10.

victorious. How much longer
in its Asian policy? Do the Vietna-
mese people want democratic gov-
ernment, and would it really be best
for them? The USS. is trying to halt
the advance of communism in the
Far East. We see the communist
advance as a threat to our security.
But can the United States be a suc-
cessful policeman in the world if it
ignores the truths mentioned above?
The march of event appears to be
stronger than any nation.

The problem in Vietnam is not
whether we should or should not
be there, The issue is what policy
are we to follow to bring the war
to a close? Do we maintain, in-
crease or decrease our commit-
ment, and more important, what
will we do at the conference table?
What are our real objectives in
Vietnam, and what will we settle
for?

These are the real issues, and they
must be decided well; for the world
becomes less and less our own back
yard the greater our wisdom must
be if we are to survive.

aged to win one game. It must have

been against their equally inept
freshman team. As long as we are
playing non-subsidized ball at Wash-
ington and Lee, why not play decent
football teams. It is hard enough to
get excited playing schools no one
has ever heard about. Since every-
thing most have ever heard about
Bridgewater football was bad (this
or any other year), why do we sche-
dule this team. A win over Bridge-
water is like beating Lexington High
School’s freshman team. Why not
drop them from the schedule at the
earliest possible time?

Coming up are two games which
are very easy to get excited about
Sewanee and Washington. The Se-
wanee of 1965 is not the Sewanee of
1964. They have lost two games.
However, they should not be under-
rated. They will certainly be out to
avenge last year’s upset loss to W&L.
Like the Generals, Sewanee plays
a ground ball game. They are not
big. On paper it looks like a toss-
up, unless MecLaughlin’s Generals
revert to their lackluster perfor-
mance of the first three games. Spirit
will win this game.

The last game is a bit different.
Washington is a better football team
than we are. Fast backs, mean line-
men, and extra big, extra fleet ends
abound on this team. The Bears
have only one loss and are sporting
a small college national ranking. Two
fine throwing quarterbacks spear-
head the best passing attack the
Generals will face this year. The
ends are exceptional, a second string
end runs a quick 9.7 100-yard dash.

In view of the spotty record of
W&L’s defense, it looks like a mas-
sacre. But so did Sewanee in '64 and
Guilford in ’65.

Since Washington and Sewanee
are gradually becoming our chief
rivals, it seems a shame that every
other year the fans are deprived of
seeing either of them. Hopefully in
the future someone will have the
foresight to schedule those games so
that each year we can see one of
these games.

Have a good Sem date, and don’t
get too much—Tom will be back

Assimilation Policies

(Continued from page 1)
the fact that these standards would
be strictly enforced on the Hill dur-
ing class hours; according to the
Executive Committee this applies for

the town of Lexington as well.
Another significant purpose of
these talks was to explain that con-
ventional dress is a unifying factor at
W&L which distinguishes it from
many other colleges, and that it
does not represent an effort to make
everyone look “preppy.’ The Assim-
ilation Committee feels, much to the
contrary, that it adds to the charac-
ter of the student and places him on
“closer level to the teacher.”

“And what conclusions can we
draw from the study we have made?
It is evident from what we have set
above, as well as from the
source material itself, that we must
not be too hasty to condemn those
who have not agreed fully with the
assessments of the facts, since these
dissenting opinions can have value in
shedding more light on lesser known
aspects.

“We agree, then, that the main
problem is central, and that we are
indebted to those scholars who have
unearthed the material with which
we have been working. It is evident
that our study has pointed up the
importance of these facts and their
relevance to our lives as young men
in 1965.”

Mr. Saunders in the Tuesday edition of the Ring-tum Phi

been negatively oriented.

We feel that if the student is to make an intelligent decision
concerning Saturday classes, he must look for positive reasons
in favor of change or keeping the present system.

Such change should not be based upon mere social con-
veniences. If such a change is made it must be for a legitimate
academic purpose.

Obviously, many students will abuse the privilege. Obvious-
ly, for many it will allow for longer road trips. However, are
there students who would use this reallotment of time usefully?
Would it create for both student and professor a more con-
dusive atmosphere in which to produce quality work? If either
of these contentions is justified then there is strong reason to
seriously consider this proposal. Even if only 20 per cent of
the student body used this time wisely, are we to penalize those
students?

The entire question centers around distributing two or
three hours on Saturday morning over five afternoons during
the week. This is not quite as burdensome as Mr. Saunders
suggests. In fact such a redistribution might lead to a better
academic atmosphere than we now enjoy. We base our conten-
tions on three factors. Others could be mentioned, but we feel
these to be the most significant.

Effective Work

As our academic program is presently set up both students
and professors are involved in active preparation for classes
every day. On Saturday they must attend classes and on Sunday
they must prepare for Monday’s work.

Psychological surveys in industry clearly indicate that work-
ers accomplish better quality work during a shorter work week.
They also indicate that there is a direct relationship between
worker productivity per hour and the number of hours on the
job,

Our point is this. Because we are involved in a constant
“grind” that seemingly never ends the quality of the work suf-
fers, and our effective production per hour is seriously re-
stricted. We feel this fact is clearly reflected in growing in-
difference and apathy on the part of the students.

Inserting a break into our work week could possibly reverse
this trend and actually lead to improvement in both the quality
and quantity of the work produced.

This may have the same effect on professors. Under our
present system professors are required to devote six days a
week to classroom lecture. Inserting a free day from the class-
room would allow them to do more research and better prepare
their material for classroom lecture. The result would be a more
effective job of teaching while they were in the classroom.

Social Life

Could an extension of our social calendar actually aid our
academic program?

To say the least, a satisfactory social life in Lexington is
difficult by the six-day week. Attaining a satisfactory social life
under these conditions has become a preoccupation for many
students.

Making the social life more convenient may lead some
students to put this phase of their college life into a better per-
spective. By this we mean the student is more apt to confine
social activities to the weekend and concentrate more on aca-
demics the other five days.

Scheduling Benefits

The five-day week would certainly have some positive bene-
fits in many courses, Today many classes, especially upperclass
courses, are better adapted to 90-minute sessions than 55-
minutes.

For example, courses which revolve on student-professor
discussion and mutual exchange of ideas would certainly bene-
fit from the extended period. Longer classes would have a
second benefit in that transitions in material would not be brok-
en into as many small segments and time now spent rehashing
old material in order to work into the subject could be devotec
to more discussions, and illustration of points.

The Friday Ring-tum Phi favors this proposal but feels
each student should make up his own mind after seriously con-
sidering both the pros and cons of such a move and vote in
next Wednesday's referendum.

Official rush week ended six weeks
ago. Many houses, though, were dis-
satisfied with the
number of pledges
in their ranks, so
they initiated a
massive deferred

rush program.
Unfortunately,
along with this
rush has come a

number of dis-
tasteful practices.
You might call

 

them “dirty rush,”
“devious rush,” or
just “rotten rush.” The point to be
made here is that such practices
are going to seriously hamper fra-
ternities at W&L.

Let’s briefly examine what these
practices are rumored to be (and I
want to emphasize the word “ru-
mor’). First, there’s the rotten tac-
tic or rushing the high-pressuring
boys who already have pledge pins
on. Then there’s the old practice of
screaming “fish house,” “animals,”
“drunks,” and “they’re on the way
down.” Also rumored is that some
houses are showing deferred rushees
their pledging ceremonies in hopes
of snowing them. Finally, there's the
capitalizing on any misfortune an-
other fraternity might have encount-
ered in the past few years.

Granted, a lot of what’s going on
isn’t technically “dirty rush,” but no
matter what you call it, it not
going to help fraternities at W&L.

I'm not going to mention the ele-
ments of personal integrity, respect
for other fraternities, etc., but they
do play a role.

What I do want to emphasize is
that fraternities all over the coun-

Millard Calls
Newest Dylan
‘Album Uneven

|
By STEVE MILLARD

| When folk song in both its musi-
cal and topical aspects responded to
the complexity of urbanized society,
the entire idiom was reborn. In spite
of the occasional wails from purists
who ery the lack of “authenticity”
in anyone who is vaguely literate or
lives within two hundred miles of a
city, most scholars have come to ac-
cept the validity of serious urban
folksingers.

The best of this group, although
subject to intense commercial ex-
posure, have continued to grow and
managed to maintain their integrity.
Today's column focuses on a new
and somewhat different effort from
one of the best-known artists in the
field.

Bob Dylan's latest release, High-
way 61 Revisited (Columbia) show-
cases both the highest potentialities
and worst excesses of the man’s
unique stye. As in his previous two
abums, Dylan continues to move
away from his earlier emphasis on
general topical or “protest” material;
more and more, his songs present
protest through the depiction of in-
dividuals

A motley crew they are, too—the
down-and-out of every description
|Folk songs always have spoken for
the oppressed, and Dylan has stood
squarely on this tradition with his
isympathy for the “ragged clowns”
of our world. There is nothing of
the clown, however, about the peo-
| ple we meet on Highway 61. “Fright-
| ening” would be a better description
| The effectiveness of his effort
varies greatly from one song to the
| next. Dylan's work has been marred
lon oceasion by two major flaws: his
lyrics sometimes pass from the poetic
|to the pretentious, and his
harsh musical style sometimes seems
inappropriate or simply boring. The
two defects converge in one spol on
this album, an eleven-minute opus
called “Desolation Row,” in which he

try are in hot water. Every day you
hear that such and such a chapter
of such and such a fraternity has
been closed for various reasons.
Some day the big guns are going to
be aimed at the “little 18” of W&L.
It may not happen soon, but it’s
going to happen, and we'd better
start preparing for it now.

The practices hinted at above are,
to say the least, not helping in
this preparation.

First of all, when one house finds
out that another house is “dirty”
rushing (I use the term liberally), a
tremendous amount of antagonism is

built up. Specifically, if two houses
are rushing the same boy and one
house gets him because of “dirty”
rush, then the word “hate” midly
describes the latter house’s feeling
for the former house. Some houses
are already eagerly awaiting the
snowball season so that they can
trash other houses. And from rea-
sonable sources, the attacks are go-
ing to make last year’s mutilation
of the DU house seem mild. But
the antagonism doesn’t stop here; it
is easily carried over to the football
field, the wrestling mat, and the
locker room. “Get those I-felt-a-

thigh’s” is the battleery. And certain-
ly actions such as these will not
help fraternities to justify their ex-
istence when they are being cross-
examined.

Secondly, “dirty” rush might very
well be equated to cheating. The
dictionary defines cheating as the
practice of fraud or trickery. Cer-
tainly showing a boy your pledge
ceremony is practicing trickery, and
certainly calling a good party house
“animals” practicing fraud. The
point to be made, though, is that if
you can cheat in one area, why can’t

Hartin Sees GOP Gain, Split in Vote

By LIN HARTIN

Last Tuesday's election aroused
more interest and excitement than
an off year has seen in a long time.
Voters turned out in record numbers
to decide especially heated contests
in Virginia and New York, as well
as a number of other cities and
states.

It is impossible, I think, to draw
any definite conclusions or forecasts
about the 1966 general elections from
last Tuesday's results. The contests
were too scattered and the political
situation at this time seems to be
entirely without precedent.

 

have forced the Democratic ticket to
campaign on these issues. In doing
this, the Republicans have caused
the once all powerful and unques-
tioned Democratic machine to offer
more responsible leadership. Thus we
see Mills Godwin, onetime staunch
segregationist, making an about-
face and offering the state a respon-
sible, progressive administration. Al-
though its ticket went down in de-
feat, the Republican Party has donc

Generals Travel To
Sewanee on Saturday

Washington and Lee will be seek-
ing, among other things, its first
College Athletic Conference victory
of the season Saturday when the
Generals travel to Tennessee to
meet Sewanee’s Purple Tigers.

A W&L win this weekend would
throw the CAC race into sudden
confusion since the Tigers currently
lead the league with a 2-0 mark.
The Generals are not unfamiliar
with the spoiler’s role, having tum-
bled an overwhelmingly favored
Sewanee team at last year’s Home-
comings 11-6. Once again decided
underdogs in Saturday’s game, the
Generals face a trying task, but the
sort of task they’ve performed to
Sewanee’s detriment in the past.

Sewanee enters the game with a
sole blemish on an otherwise im-
pressive record, that a 29-6 trounc-
ing at the hands of Austin College.
The Tiger offense is rolling along
at over 30 points and 350 yards per
game. Led by tailback Bill John-
son, a Little All-America candidate
who's ranked 12th among the na-
tion’s small college rushers with
683 yards in 98 carries, Sewanee’s
Tigers back a powerful wallop. Rusty
Adcock and Charlie Gignilliat com-
plement a potent running game
which features the single wing.

Stopping Johnson appears to be
the key to defeating Sewanee. The
Purple Tigers have lost only twice
in the past two and both
times Johnson rushed for negligible
yardage. When W&L turned the trick
last season, he managed only a
paltry twelve yards. Against Austin,
Johnson picked up seven.

Linebacker Paul Tessman leads a
tenacious defense which has suffler-
ed only one lapse so far this fall,
and that against Austin. The Tigers
have been particularly obstinate on
those rare occasions when the op-
position managed to get within their
twenty yard line.

The Generals come into the game
off a crushing victory over Bridge-
water, 41-13. Coach McLaughlin un-
veiled last Saturday a welcome ad-
dition to a flailing offense in the
person of sophomore fullback, Bill
McDavid. Soph quarterback Andy
Bloom found the range once again
last weekend, flipping two touch-
down passes. A strong passing game
figured prominently in W&L’s two
victories this season. The Generals
will once again have to take to the
air, and successfully, to pose a threat
for Sewanee.

Injuries, though, still plague the
W&L camp. Presently, half a dozen
key performers are wearing green
jerseys, at least two being doubtful
starters on Saturday. Tackle Logan
Bullitt and halfback John Bogart
have been hampered with leg trouble
although they have responded to
treatment. Charlie Myers still re-

Kendrick is nursing a broken finger
which will probably exclude him
from future service this season.

Nevertheless, McDavid, Bloom,
tackle Jerry Croston, and halfback
Tom Pittman have filled in capably,
particularly last week against
Bridgewater.

An alert defense scored two touch-
downs and_ repeatedly forced
Bridgewater mistakes. W&L’s defe-
sive unit has played well all season.

Sewanee, however, provides the real
test.

Duckwall, Freshman Boost
W&XL’s Links Prospects

The Washington and Lee Golf
Team is beginning to take shape for
the 1966 season. Returning veterans
are co-captains Ed Crosland and
Roger Sennott, Jim Fulwider, Bob
Duckwall, and Jeff Skarda. Rookies
who have looked good are freshmen
Bobby Mathews and Lex Tarumianz
and junior Tracy Duggan.

Crosland is very excited by the
team’s prospects this year. The big-
gest addition to the team is the
turn of Duckwall, who played in
either the number one or two spots
depending on the opposition. Bob did
not play last year in order to con-
centrate on his studies, but this year
feels that he can combine golf and
studies without difficulty.

re-

Freshman Mathews also appears to
be capable of giving the team a big
lift this year. He was one of the out-
standing high school golfers in the
Richmond area last year

Crosland, who was the outstanding
golfer last season, is looking forward
to another successful season. Ed
had his handicap down to scratch as
of last summer.

Roanoke and the U.Va. game next

By CHARLIE BENSINGER
Dear Mom and Dad.

Last week your reporter
and ‘behind in his 2:00-3:00 labors.
But now a
a reversal of form, or perhaps even
going so far as to
be behind in both
(have a tranquil-
izer mother).

We eves
intend to give IM
action ithe major
emphasis of this
week’s column,
and you had bet-
ter enjoy it—you’ll
never see it again!

Just because it
is November,
there’s no reason why we can’t fin-
ally give ‘the tennis and golf results.
Ergo, in the final tennis competition
it was Phi Delt, then Sigma Nu,
and ‘then a tie between SAE and
KA. Like we said, SAE just can’t

miss. Sure!

Bensinger

In golf the big winner was SPE,
| followed by Phi Delt (could this be
the year of the Phi Delts?), Sigma
Chi, and Lambda Chi.

Looking at the turkeys, we think
PiKA won ,with Sigma Chi second,
Delt Third, and Phi Ep fourth. We're
really not sure as there was a cock-
tail party going on at this time.

Now for football. Two leagues
have been decided, one is in a tie,
and the other looks safe (that is
relative to our other picks, with
which we have done so well). ZBT
and Pi Phi have won their leagues,
while Kappa Sig and DU will play-
the League C crown. Phi
Delt seems to be the eventual win-
ner of League B (thank you Birnie
Harper and Mike Lawrence for your
great scouting reports).

Turning to the aquatic sport of
swimming, Norris Eastman thinks
that the big fishes were SPE, Delt
but he isn’t
positive yet (could he have been at

the cocktail party too?)

Now we are up to date, except
for wrestling and bowling. That
much we'll worry about later.

Therefore, we are down to the
filler (it’s much more fun anyhow).
Point 1—When will the Hill realize
that the wrestling team has the best
all-time record here at W&L and
allot coach Miller funds for a decent
practice area? With ‘the outstanding
job that he has done against schools
many times larger and subsidized to
boot, he deserves some help.

Point 2—Congratulations to David
Fleischer for naming Marion Motley
as Cleveland’s first great fullback.

At 5:58 last Friday he burst into

the ante-bellum mansion of your
columnist shouting, “Motley, Mot-
ley.” When it came to light that he
was answering the question and not
giving his views on us (see how
the editorial “we” spreads the
blame), he had won a bottle of the
finest champagne ‘that money can
buy. You see David, some good
comes out of living next door after-
all.

a) “The most comic American since Mark

b) ‘Nothing more than a writer of

2) The Louvre can be run in under six minutes.
3) Arthritis is unavailable in Palm Beach, Florida.

4) The best reason for contributing to charity is getting your picture

sure that this type of cheating will
not confine itself to rush alone in
the future—if we don’t do something
now. Soon success will become so
important that ineligible players will
be used in intramural games, cold
quiz files will be destroyed, etc. And
certainly this won’t be helping fra-
ternities to justify their existence.

administration to straighten things
out. Now, we all know that frater-
nities everywhere are suspicious of
their respective university adminis-
trations, and W&L is no exception.
Therefore, we might witness a rapid-
ly deteriorating relationship be-
tween the fraternities and the ad-
ministration at W&L.

And then the stage will be set for
the boards to be put on the doors
of the fraternity houses.

I'm not saying that this is what's
going to happen. But it is possible;
therefore, the fraternities should
take a responsible role now, and nip
the whole affair in the bud.

It all starts at the bottom and
builds up. So why don’t the respec-
tive fraternities concentrate on their
respective strong points and relegate
“dirty” rush to the pages of history?
It is better than relegating fraterni-
ties to the pages of history.

Dylan’s ultimate concern is not nec-

final touch, the musical setting is
one of his best.

The other selections range from
pretty good to indifferent. One of
them is the hit single, “Like a Rolling
Stone,” which to me epitomizes the
present problems of the “folkrock”
style. Here is a singer treating an

ability to the status of a “rolling

phrases such as “Napoleon in rags” —

any appreciation of the words is

have to resolve this question if he

As a whole, the album is not one

BORDA

For the first time in the history of Washington and Lee,
students will hold voting positions on a faculty committee. The

new group, called the Studen

t Affairs Committee, was

ap-

proved by the faculty on November 1, at its monthly meeting.

As a result,

tions—were eliminated and _ their
functions incorporated in the new
group. Futhermore, the Student Af-
fairs Committee will assume juris-
diction over all student affairs not
now covered by other committees

and serve in an advisory capacity to

the Dean of Student’s Office.

Four students and six faculty
members will be regular members
of the committee. Set to represent
students are the President of the
Student Body, President of the IFC,

of the Student Control
and the President of the
Student Bar Association. Dean At-

Affiliation Upon

By JOE WILSON

Gerhard Lenski, chairman of the
Department of Sociology at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina, last night
at duPont Hall presented a relation-
ship of religious affiliation to voting
behavior.

Professor Lenski, supporting his
theory with voting statistics, believes
that religion is one of the most im-
portant factors deermining voting
habits. Experts have ignored religion
as a voting vactor, he said, because
they thought of religious groups as
only associations which meet once a
week for an hour.

While this may contain some
truth, Lenski contends that relig-
ious groups are not merely asso-
ciations, but are really commun-
ties. As a community, these homo-
genous groups become partially
closed and develop a consensus
which is expressed at the ballot
box.

Sociological analysis of voting be-
gan when Columbia University
studied the Presidential campaign of
1940 in Erie County, Ohio. The ex-
| pected voting factors of class, family,

party loyalty, press influence, and
others were studied.

Also found, but not studied, was
a religious factor, which had most
Protestants voting Republican and
most Catholics voting Democrat.
It was seen that the religious fac-
tor was three times greater than
the class factor in determining the
vote,

From this initial study, a pattern
has emerged showing religion al-
ways comparable to class as a factor,
and, in 1960, religion was 34 per cent
to class 12:5 per cent. The Presiden-
tial campaign of 1960 was the height
of the religious factor in American
balloting, Lenski explained.

Dr. Lenski cited other stastics on
an international level which showed
that the deeper religious split in a
country, the higher the religious
factor in voting. England is an ex-
ample of a country in which reli-
gion does not enter politics because
nearly everyone is Protestant. Cana-
da is the opposite because the coun-
try is split deeply between Catho-

Classes Poll Set for Tomorrow

*

Debate Scheduled for Newcomb 8
At 7 p.m. Tonight on Class Vote

SNOWDEN

Abolition of Saturday classes will be the subject of a refer-
endum set before the student body on Wednesday. The refer-
endum, sponsored by the Executive Committee, will investigate
student opinion on a five day class week.

Voting will take place in the Freshman Dorm Quad, Wash-
" —————<—=i ington Hall and in the Law School.

The polls will be open from 8:30
a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The voting in the
Quad will be supervised by the
Freshman class officers, Dave Craw-
ley and John Thiemeyer.

Debate Changed

A debate, organized at the request
of the E.C., will explore the relative
merits of this question tonight. The
debate, originally scheduled for 8
p.m. in duPont auditorium, will be
held in Newcomb 8 at 7:00 p.m., due
to a conflict with another program.

Speaking in favor of abolition of
Saturday classes will be Dave Mar-
chese and Rusty Meyer and in oppo-
sition will be Bill Grant and Jim
Hamill. The W&L Debate Team
sponsoring the program.

A spokesman for the EC expressed
the hope that students will fully
consider the consequences of the ab-
olition of Saturday classes. This
move would impose an increased
work load on students and in addi-
tion, scheduling adjustments might
result in 90 minute classes, after-
noon classes or both. Discussion of
tomorrow's referendum has ben car-
ried in the last two editions of the
Ring-tum Phi.

Should the referendum show that
a significant portion of the student
body is in favor of a five day class
week, the EC will submit a recom-
mendation to the Faculty Committee
,on Courses and Degrees by whom
the final decision will be made

Richard Nash, Sophomore EC Rep-
| resentative, is in charge of carrying
peo the referendum.

|
|

At long last the fac ulty has corrected what could only have

been called a gross bureaucratic inefficiency.
the new Student Affairs Committee has accomplished two signi-
ficant reforms in the existing faculty committee structure. First,
the faculty has given for the first time voting membership on
any committee to four students, and more importantly, it has
eliminated the overlapping and duplication inherent in the pre-

vious system.

Although the student voting power is not pre ponderent, it
apparent that student influence will weigh heavily in the
deliberations of this new body. are convinced that this

group will provide a practical and stile forum for the con-

duct of student affairs.

In applauding the efforts of the faculty in this area, it is ”
opinion of this newspaper that this marks the beginning of «
new era of progressive action. We only hope this spirit will
manifest itself in other ways throughout the entire University

community.

Dirty Boab Should | Be Unlimited
Expose Truth About Fraternities

By NICK RUFFIN
In the Friday edition of the Ring-
tum Phi a columnist complained of

suasion known as
“dirty rush.” He
argued that dirty
rush is immoral,
dishonest, and un-
gentlemanly. If
dirty rush is not
controlled the fra-
ternity system at
Washington and
Lee may be elim-

Ruflin inated according
to his predictions.

 

Apparently dirty rush has caused
undeclared hostilities to break out
among fraternities. Yesterday, as I
walked out Washington Street, I
heard wild cheering coming from a
fraternity house. I paused to listen
is the cheering reached a fenzy,
“HATE, HATE, HATE, HATE!” Ap-
parently dirty rush has caused some
fraternities to adopt hate breaks as
part of their rituals. These militant
activities are obviously preparations

for the predicted Snow Ball War

The Friday columnist obviously
iad strong feelings about dirty rush
Sour grapes over a few lost pledges
might even have clouded his think-
ing. What the columnist may be ad-
mitting is that his fraternity is not
as good at dirty rush as are some
others

As rush week is now arranged, it

almost impossible for a freshman
to find out anything about the fra-
ternities except what the fraternitie
want him to know. In a rush date
everyone the freshman meets
friendly to him, sometimes sicken-

ngly so. The freshman hears of the |
vonders of each house; how brother |:

Bill will loan you his Ferrari fo
read trips, how the house had Ray

year, how the house food was fea-

The question is, “Where does

bid for the Presidency. He pledged

Tuesday S ports

B. S.

By TOM CARPENTER ‘

 

I wish to thank Drew Baur for taking over the sports page
for me last week while I was holed up with my advertising book
at the request of Mr. Paxton Davis. Drew did the layout and
wrote the headlines, and B.S. column, despite what the byline
on the latter may have stated. I feel I have to correct this error
in order to allow credit or blame, as the case may be, to fall
on the man responsible. Actually, the B.S. column was sup-
posed to be accredited to Dick DeWaugh. If you ever see this
byline on a story, you will know that this story is the work of
Drew Baur.

The 1965 Crystal Ball Award has already been decided. |}
This highly treasured award goes to Anson Mount, the college |@

football writer for Playboy magazine. The particular prediction
that merited the C.B. Award is the one that the University of
lowa football team would win nine games this season while los-

ing one and that Coach Jerry Burns of Iowa would be Coach ‘

of the Year.
lowa Flops
lowa’s record is one win and seven defeats including Sat-
urday’s loss to number one ranking Michigan State. Iowa
reached the ultimate depth the previous week when the Hawk-
eyes were defeated by the Hoosiers of Indiana, 21-17. The
Hoosiers usually consider it a successful season when they win

 

one Big Ten Conference game.

If Coach Barnes is lucky, he may even be head coach at
Iowa next season. And the Hawkeyes are supposed to have |
three All-American offensive players, led by quarterback Gary |
Snook afd flanker Karl Noonan.

After watching the Lexington-Buena Vista game Friday,
Shaun Donahoe and I decided that Coach Lee McLaughlin
could learn something from the two high school coaches. |
Buena Vista tried a screen pass up the middle, while Lexington
had a variety of odd plays that had not been seen recently by
the Tuesday staff columnists. Buena Vista also had a fake punt |
play that was very clever. The center hikes the ball to the |
blocking back who takes off for the end zone, while the Lex- |
ington defense is still looking for the punt. Why doesn’t W&L |
add a little life to its attack with such clever tricks? Spectators |
like variety in football, something that is not seen at Wilson |
Field unless the visitors’ coach is a man of imagination.

Shot Putter Turns Quarterback

Did you know that the world’s heaviest quarterback is here
at Washington and Lee? Take a look at Phi Kappa Psi’s field |
general at their next intramural football game, and you will
see Ted Larson, who is better known as Tubey. He weights in at
about 250 pounds and can throw the ball as far as any pro
quarterback. Against Phi Kappa Sigma in a 0-0 game with
about 10 seconds left Tubey told his receivers to head for the
end zone and look for the ball to split the uprights. It did and |
Bob Aldrich caught it for the winning touchdown. It added |
up to about a 60 yard pass in the air. The world’s heaviest |
quarterbac ks with one of the world’s longest passes.

| yet not strong enough to deliver a
scoring punch.

Roanoke’s’ game strategy was to
place five men in their backfield,
which allowed W&L’s halfbacks and
insides to control the game. This was
an essential factor in the resulting
scoreless tie.

The General's primary opportunity
came with one and one-half minutes
in the game on a penalty kick. How-
ever, the attempt was stopped by the
opposition’s goalie, thus advancing
the contest into overtime.

Special recognition in this game

Anthony Rushes
For 115 Yards;

Generals Lose

Someone should propose a system
N.C.A.A. which would de-
termine the victor of a football game,
not by the score, but by the statis-
tics. If such a system had ‘been in
effect last Saturday, Washington and
Lee would have been credited with
a win, instead of a heartbreaking
6-0 loss to Sewanee on the winner’s
NS

Sewanee took the opening kickoff
and marched 60 yards for the lone
score of the game. Aided by two
crucial penalties and three pass
plays, the Tigers’ march was capped
when Bill Johnson went the final
two yards for the score. At this point
Washington and Lee made some ad-
justments in the defense which was
to stymie Sewanee for the remainder
of the game. But they came too late
as the Tigers had scored the points
necessary for victory.

The Generals’ offense outgained
Sewanee’s offense, but Wé&lL could
not come up with the big scoring

| play which would have given victory
| to the best team on the field that
| day. John Anthony continued his as-

sault on the school rushing record
as he gained 115 yards over what
was regarded as a sturdy defensive
line.

W&L’'s final chance for a score
came with six minutes left in the
game when Rudd Smith recovered
a Sewanee fumble on the Tigers’ 38
yard line. But the big play never
materialized, and W&L saw a very
bitter and frustrating game end.

The Generals’ defense was up to
par as they stopped Sewanee’s of-
fense except for the first drive. Jamie
Andrew led the fine trio of line-
backers in halting the Tigers as he
intercepted his second pass of the
season and generally made life mis-
erable for the Sewanee backs, in-
cluding the highly touted Johnson.
Little Billy Andrews was not too
gentle with Johnson either has he
made a solo tackle on him that left
the Tiger star unconscious for
half hour.

Near the end of the game W&L
showed how staunch its defense is
as the offense, vainly trying to score,
the ball to Sewanee on the
W&L seven yard line instead of
punting on fourth down. Here the
defense came in and after four
downs had pushed Sewanee back 35
yards. This was typical of the way
in which the Generals played all
afternoon, but all they have to show

Stacton To Speak Again

Author David Stacton, Glasgow
Visiting Professor at Washington and
Lee University this fall, will
present the second of a series of
public lectures Tuesday.

Stacton will speak on “How
Writing Gets Written,” at 8:15 p.m.
at duPont Auditorium.

A native of Nevada and educated
at Stanford and the University of
California at Berkley, Stacton has
written a number of novels and also
biography, history and verse. His
history of the Bonaparte family is to
be published by Simon & Schuster
this winter.

His appearance at Washington and
Lee is sponsored by the Glasgow En-
dowment Committee, which since
1947 has administered the program
established by the will of the late
Arthur Graham Glasgow, a distin-
guished engineer and honorary W&L
alumnus. The will stipulates that
the fund “promote the art of expres-
sion by pen and tongue.”

Law School Conducts Trial

Based on Actual Ciil Suit

By JIM McCOMMONS

Last Tuesday the law school held
its semi-annual mock trial based on
an actual civil suit that accurred in
Alabama last year. The Mock Trial,
presided over by The Honorable M.
M. Long, rendered a judgment that
was in accordance with the decision
passed down in Alabama.

The Mock Trial Committee of the
Student Bar Association was respon-
sible for the organization of the
trial. Baxter Davis, senior law stu-
dent and chairman of the committee,
and intermediate law students Jeff
Ward and Chuck Bowie began
studying the transcript of the Ala-
bama trial several weeks ago. They
reduced the case to a set of basic
facts by eliminating superfluous
details which did not change the
legal issues of the case. They then
set these facts to the Lexington lo-
cale.

The case presented at the Mock
Trial involved a truck driver, the
defendant, who had left his truck at
2:30 a.m. parked | on a the road un-

YR’ S To Hear

GOP Officer
Ray Humphries

Ray Humphries, Director of the
Political Education and Training Di-
vision of the National Republican
Party will address the November
Young Republican Club meeting
Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in the biology
lecture room in the New Science
Building.

Humphries, who has been called a
dynamic and enthralling speaker by
Young Republican Officers who have
heard him, will lead a series of sem-
inars immediately after his address.
Among the presently scheduled half-
hour meetings will be those with
the 1968 Mock Convention Coordi-
nating Committee, all students in-
terested in a career in politics, and
the Young Republican officers.

It was announced that this meet-
ing will initiate a new policy of giv-
ing away a doorprize of a bottle of
bourbon.

The November meeting will also
serve as a kick-off of Stage Two of
the membership drive through which
the Washington and Lee YR Club
hopes to become the largest in Vir-
ginia. As incentive, the Club is of-
fering a $45 sporicoat from the Col-
lege Town Shop to the person who
can sign up the most new members.
Interested students desiring member-
ship are encouraged to Jeff

danger of causing the truck to jack-
knife. He caught a ride into Lex-
ington but was unable to return
with a repairman for several hours.
In the meantime, a car had crashed
into the rear of the truck, killing a
man, but not seriously injuring his
wife.

The wife filed charges for wrong-
ful death. The $35,000 awarded her
in the mock trial is the maximum in
a Virginia wrongful death action.

Chief counsel for the plaintiff was
senior Charles Bistany. Associate
counsels for the plaintiff were senior
Henry Counts and intermediate Tom
Meadows. Chief defense counsel was
senior Danny Bird. Seniors Phil Mil-
ler and Al Prillaman were associate
defense counsels.

The witnesses were played by stu-
dents from the law school. Each stu-
dent was given only the facts known
by the witness he was portraying
and general information about the
case.

The jury was comprised from
townspeople from Lexington who
gave their time to assist the law
school.

Cornell Sestaeene
Lectures On Pascal

And Creative Spirit

Morris G. Bishop, a well-known
author and teacher, spoke Wednes-
day night at VMI on “Pascal and
the Creative Spirit.”

Dr. Bishop is Professor Emeritus
of Romance Literature and Universi-
ty Historian at Cornell University.
He has been a lecturer at the Uni-
versity of Athens. He is currently
president of the Modern Language
Association.

The lecturer defined genius by giv-
ing a biographical sketch of Pascal.
This seventeenth-century Frechman
paved the way for the invention of
ealculus and made important con-
tributions to gas pressure laws. Math
and physics soon came to bore him.
Pascal then became the leading op-
ponent of Roman Catholic funda-
mentalism. His Lettres Provencales,
defending his religious belief, became
the basis of modern French prose
The collection of his philosophical
notes, Pensees, is included in the En-
cylopedia Britannica's collection of
Great Books.

Readings By Poets Kizer, Stuart

The seminars in Literature Com-
mittee presented a reading by poets
and Dabney Stuart
in duPont Auditorium Tuesday
night.

Miss Kizer, the founder and editor
of Poetry Northwest, was introduced
by Mr. James Boatwright of the
W&L English department. He said
that the most important quality for
a poet is an individual tone of voice,
and that Miss Kizer has such a voice.

After thanking Mr. Boatwright for
his remarks, the poet said that she
has tried to develop a voice of this
kind in her latest book, which was
inspired by Chinese poetry. Her first
“spotty.”

Bogan, Kunitz Read

Alter reading several poems from
the second volume, she asked per-
mission to read from the works of
two other poets whom she described
as “neglected,” Louise Bogan and
Stanley Kunitz. She read a poem,
“Second Air Force,” by Randall Jar-
rell, who was killed by an automo-
bile two weeks ago.

In closing, Miss Kizer read a long
poem inspired by the works of
Heinrich Heine, which she described

s “the kind of poem I think Heine
would have written if he had been
an American and a woman and had
led the life I have.”

In introducing Stuart,
the W&L faculty this year, Boat-
wright described him as “a poet
who is frequently personal and al-
ways moving.”

Stuart began by reading two love
poems and a poem written as
“Shakespeare speaking to
through the Fool in King Lear.”

poem he has been working on for
three years. Entitled “The Fair,” it
represents life as a series of side-
show acts at a carnival.

His next three selections came
from his new book, The Diving Bell,
which will appear next April. He
described it as “a tribute to the peo-
ple who have influenced me in one
way or another.”

His final poem, the only one writ-
ten since he has been at W&L, was
entitled “The Student.”

Miss Kizer also met with Mr. Boat-
wright’s classes in modern poetry,
where she discussed the works of
Theodore Roethke, an American poet
whom she knew for many years.

The reading was the 53rd lecture
sponsored by the committee. Notable
figures who have appeared under the
auspices of the program in the past
include critics Northrop Frye and
Hugh Kenner and poet Miller Wil-
liams.

‘No Change’ Backers

Supporters of Saturday classes
won a narrow victory in last
Wednesday’s referendum, with a

total vote of 358 in favor of keeping
the present six-day week and 275
in favor of a change.

The EC, however, expressed dis-
appointment that only 633 students—
less than half of the student body—
had voted in what the EC considered
to be an important opinion poll.

The referendum was to climax sev-
eral years of formal and informal
discussion on the topic.

On Tuesday, Nov. 9, in order to
present the issue to the student
body before the referendum, the
varsity debate team, in cooperation
with the Forensic Union, sponsored
a debate on the topic, Resolved:
That Saturday Classes Should Be
Abolished.

Speaking for the affirmative were
Dave Marchese and Rusty Meyer,
and for the negative, Bill Grant and
ireshman Jim Hamill. Kaz Herchold
* served as chairman for the debate.

Following the referendum, the
following statement was made by
Richard Nash, a sophomore EC rep-
resentative:

Nash's Statement

The votes have been cast and
counted, but the full significance of
the results has not yet been weighed.
On Wednesday the students of Wash-
ington and Lee got the chance to
express their views on the abolition
of Saturday classes. The vote was
358 for keeping them and 275 for do-
ing away with them.

Where do we go from here? It is
the task of the Executive Committee,
with regard to the results, to make
a recommendation to the self-study
group. But just what that recom-
mendation will contain is a bigger
question than is immediately com-
prehended. The easiest course of ac-
tion wold be to recommend that we
keep Saturday classes because more
students are in favor of keeping them
than are in favor of abolishing them.
But after looking at the situation a
little closer, one finds that it is not
quite that simple. There are several
points that must be viewed first.

University. Less than half of this
enrollment, 633, voted on the refer-
endum. Are we to assume that the
problem of Saturday classes is not
major enough to even arouse the
interest of half of the student body?
If this is to be assumed, then there
is no reason for the present sys-
tem not to be continued.

But the validity of this argument
is questioned. Very seldom does vot-
ing at Washington and Lee, exclud-
ing elections, poll over half of the
student body. Last year, a referen-
dum concerning political parties,
which was heatedly discussed and
much publicized, received barely
over five hundred total votes.

Consequently, there is the question
of whether we should make a judg-
ment based on the vote taken, or
consider the entire issue of little im-
portance.

(1) A five day week would have
included many inconveniences. The
prospects of having afternoon classes
and ninety minute class periods was
put forth to the students by way of
news articles, editorials, and a de-
bate. Yet two hundred and seventy-
five students, fully realizing these
inconveniences, voted for the aboli-
tion of Saturday classes anyway.

(2) In addition to this, many of
the three hundred and fifty-eight
students who voted for a six day
week, do sothinking that there was
a possibiilty of the abolishment of
Saturday classes on big weekends.

It seems that a logical course of

Where Were You?

Although Wednesday’s referendum on Saturday Classes
drew only 47 per cent of the student body to the polls, it does
seem rather apparent that Washington and Lee students favor

keeping Saturday classes.

The matter has now been dropped by the Executive Com-
mittee as far we can ascertain. The Self-study Committee has
gotten its answer. The Ring-tum Phi questions, however, what
the other 53 per cent of the student body thinks.

Is it too much to ask of students to cast a ballot either for
or against a proposal which could change University policy as

would Saturday classes?

Awad Queries Quiz System

By JIM AWAD |

American society of 1965 is struc-
tured in such a way as to make a
college degree of
utmost importance
to every individu-

al. Consequently
many of us go to
college without
even considering
the value of var-
ious alternatives.
But worse than

this, many of us
go through college
itself without
questioning the
purpose and value of what we are
doing.

This columnist has given consider-
ation to the above question and feels
compelled to make a few comments.

To say the least, the system of
higher education in the United States
isn’t what it could be.

Let’s look at the lecture system
first. It seems that this system
does have a definite value, provided
that the professor is of exceptional
quality. But it's when you hit the
bering professor that the system
breaks down. Have you ever sat
through fifty minutes with a boring
professor? It’s pure agony.

Anyway, the guy stands up there
for fifty minutes and drones on and
on about what seems to be nothing.
If he does have anything to say, he'll
never get it across, first of all because
he doesn't know how to, and second-
ly, beeause all the students are
probably asleep.

A lot of people today are scream-
ing about the lack of motivation in
college students. Well, it all begins in
the classroom. It is the exceptional
student who can maintain a maxi-
mum degree of interest in a course
when the professor shouldn't even

teaching. Granted, this type of

 

Awad

 

the professor is in the minority, but
he’s still all over the place, and he’s
hampering the goals of education
(whatever they are.) It would seem
that an essential element of educa-
tion is a clashing and interaction of
ideas. How can this interaction take
place when the person who is sup-
posed initiate the interaction
doesn't know how to do so?
Secondly, let's look at the
of hour quizzes. It seems these

to

cone

cept

  

julzzes fall short of accomplishing
their purpose. Somehow, they ot
upposed to aid the student in the/|

imi process—-perhaps by giving |

forced stimulus.” What hap-

 

 

ns in practice, though, is that the
tudent hibernates in the library for

phies, and problems inte his head

This in itself isn't too bad, but what
is really poor is that the student is
compelled to write a paper in such
a way as to pass the particular stand-
ards of a particular professor. This is
where we run into trouble. Profes-
sor A likes facts, while Professor B

(teaching the same course) likes
generalizations.
Well, which is more important,

facts or generalizations?

The third deficiency seems to be
that the grading of the paper de-
pends totally on the professor; there-
fore, various unnecessary variables
enter into the grade—i.e.: how many
times you cut class, whether the
professor was in a good mood, how
much time he had to grade the
paper, your past performance, how
much browning you did, etc. It seems
that grades are much too import-
ant to have such variables included
in their calculation.

And it seems, finally, that final ex-
ams suffer from the same deficiencies
as quizzes, except on a proportion-
ately larger basis.

In essence, then, this system of lec-
tures, quizzes, and final exams lack
the elements of motivation, perman-
ent retention of subject matter, and
objective grading. One thing is sure
though, and that is that you couldn't
change one aspect of this system

without changing the other two
Quizzes, final exams, and lectures
are muually dependent on each

other. Also, the faults cited above
go hand in hand with this system.

W&L’s Artist Dislikes Artistic Faddism;
Enjoys Teaching, Fishing, Abstractionists

Ray Prohaska, who is now in his
second year as W&L’s Artist in Res-
idence, is a big, genial man and a
man who obviously enjoys life.

“IT can’t remember when I didn’t
want to be a painter,” he says. “It’s
a hard life—you have to make all
kinds of sacrifices before you get es-
tablished—but for me it’s the only
life. I love painting.”

He was speaking in connection
with the exhibit of his work which
is now on display in duPont Hall; a
remarkable and varied collection,
ranging from abstractions to full-
length portraits and from oils to
lithographs.

Also included are two paintings
done as illustrations for the Satur-
day Evening Post, which prompted
a question about how much of this
kind of work Prohaska has done. The
artist replied that he has done quite
a bit, although with many magazines
folding or changing their format
there is much less opportunity in
this field, which used to provide a
living for a good many artists.

“Of course, illustration work has
its drawbacks,” he said. “You don’t
get the chance for real self-expres-
sion—though this depends on the
kind of reader the magazine gets. An
intellectual rag, for instance, allows
a lot more freedom because its read-
ers know something about painting.”

As is evident in the collection,
which is dominated by pictures of
fishermen, Prohaska loves to fish,
especially in the surf. “In fact, that’s
the main thing I dislike about teach-
ing here, because I’m stuck here in
the fall when the surf fishing is best.
There are smallmouth bass in the
creeks around town, and some hatch-
ery trout in the spring, but nothing
I can get excited about.”

On the whole, though, he likes
W&L and likes teaching. “The people
and the country are nice. And teach-
ing gives me a lot of time to paint.
I ean work in the morning and teach
in the afternon, which suits me fine.
I expect to be back next year, though
I miss New York and my home on
Long Island.”

His plans for the future include
the installation of a press for etch-
ing and lithography work, which the
fine arts department already has but
is not set up yet. This will be used
by students who are interested in
doing print work.

In talking about his own career,
Prohaska said that he was influenced
in his youth primarily by Cezanne.
Later, he became “semi-involved”
with the New York school of abstract
expressionism led by Jackson Pol-
lock, Willem DeKooning and
others, all of whom he knew person-
ally.

“But I wouldn't call myself a mem-
ber of the New York Movement,”
Prohaska says. “I've never been in-
terested in developing a personal

style in order to make a reputation. |
I work in one style for a while, and |

then get bored with it and go into
something else. Maybe this is the

wrong way to work, but I prefer it. |

“In facet, I think this business of
style is too much overdone today,
especially in this country. Ameri-
cans have to have labels for every
damn thing. The minute you do

something, somebody slaps a label
on it. And then they get tired of it,
and out it goes, whether it’s any
good or not.

“Take this thing about Pop art.
There are some good artists in this
movement—Bob Rauschenberg and
Jasper Johns, for example, although
they tend to be overshadowed by
pure gimmickers like this Andy
Warhol—but all they are doing is

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 

Ray Prohaska
“L love painting”

rehashing old ideas, redoing things
that were done forty years ago by
people like Marcel Duchamp and
Man Ray, and done better at that.
“For instance, the real point of
Pop art, which is the feeling for
the vulgarity of American culture,
was expressed by Stuart Davis back
in the Thirties better than anybody
could ever do it again.”
He feels the same way about optical

 

“Tragic Realists’ ” Philosophy Examined

 

Anderson Dissects Protest

By JOHN ANDERSON

What is it that motivates so many
young people today? Is it a belief in
a “cause”? Does identification with
a “cause” generate a feeling or sense
of security—even if that cause is an
unpopular one? As a matter of fact,
aren't the major “causes” of today
minority opinions and unpopular
ideals?

Take Vietnam for example. Those
students and young people who are
opposed to the war in that country
are supposedly a minority in their
opinion; and thousands of people
herald to the call for demonstrations
against war. Lately, there has been
a rash of counter-demonstrations by
students and people in general who
back up the President's policy.

Disregarding the issues in them-
selves—the moral, ethical and legal
opinions against the Vietnamese War
or for draft-card burning — the
“cause” is by nature always some
kind of protest. Songs are sometimes
used as a means of expression of
protest; from Joan Baez who may
sing about civil rights or may pro-
test the bomb, to Bob Dylan, who
laments the loss of individuality in
a freakish and complex society, sing-
ers subtly infiltrate the minds of

   
    
   
   
     
   

| generations

, Young people today. This is one way
,in which a young person becomes
aware of the “protest.”

A closer affiliation or empathy
arises if a student or young person
witnesses a demonstration or takes
part in one. There are generally two
types of protesters: the activist and
the sedentary. The activist will take
part in demonstrations and may or
may not go to jail in support of his
convictions. The sedenatary protester
will follow his particular cause—he
usually picks two or more to fol-
low at one time—and is equally ac-
quainted with the arguments sup-
porting it as the activist. Generally,
however, both types do not become
thoroughly versed in their “cause.”

This brings us back to the central
question in which we ask what mo-
tivates the young person today? If
he is not sufficiently acquainted with
the cause he is supporting, why
does he demonstrate, go to jail or
debate the ethies of his country’s
policy? Perhaps the answer lies in
the brief time which has passed since
the Second World War.

For generations men have been
swearing that they will make this
world a better place than it is now
for their children, or then its condi-
tion during their parents’ time: and
for generations men have succeeded
in drawing this country into one war
after another. After the Second
World War, men renewed their
pledges only to fall into the Korean
War. Following that fiasco came

 

-— Suez, Laos and Vietnam

Young people blame the past two
for the various wars
and bombs. In that brief period of

elders either a warped sense of mor-

many students today totally reject

Rock And Roll
Songs Praised
As Good Music

By STEVE MILLARD

The following statement is an ac-
tual excerpt from the work of a re-
spected critic, and will appear in my
forthcoming book, Case Histories of
Unemployed Prognosticators:

“Rock and Roll is on the way out
and will be forgotten by the end of
1956.”

Despite the unfortunate fate of this
particular prediction, however, the
big beat was long
regarded by seri-
ous analysts with,
at best, a sort of

 

 

 

pained tolerance.
When a reviewer
with _ scholarly

credentials forced
himself to dwell
on the subject, his
attitude was that
of an evangelist
surveying recent
fluctuations in the

 

we &
Millard

abortion statistics.

All this has changed in the past
year or so. Somehow, rock and roll
became a legitimate subject for criti-
cism on a purely musical basis. This
new posture represents a complete
about-face for many critics, and war-
rants exploration by an interested
but confused audience. One listen-
er’s musings have produced two rea-
sons for this abrupt capitulation:

(1) The continued popularity of the
style—especially as mirrored in a
flourishing family of notorious gyra-
tions—virtually forced the reluctant
critics to re-evaluate their positions.
Typical of this soul-searching are
these recent comments from a for-
merly hostile observer, New York
Times folk critic Robert Shelton:

“To find artistic value in rock and
roll is not ‘capitulating to the tyran-
ny of teenage taste.’ When we, as
folk devotees lose touch with music
the people are making and living by,
we are sowing the seeds of our own
obsolescence and snobbish isolation.”

A further influence is the recogni-
tion that rock no longer appeals
strictly to “teenage taste.” The gen-
eration which accompanied the music
through its infancy is now in its late
twenties—an age at which popular
music fans supposedly discover Tom-
my Dorsey. To the astonishment of
the crystal-ball set, a large percent-
age of these early listeners subborn-
ly refused to “outgrow” the new
sound, and consequently turned the
names of Dorsey, Harry James and
their counterparts into pleasant
anachronisms

(2) A survey of reck and roll over
the past twelve years reveals a vast
overall improvement in the quality
of the music itself. To quote another
convert, jazz eritie Ralph Gleason
has maintained that “Rock record-
ings are a lot more interesting than
the average jazz releases.”

A discussion of the specific musi-
eal developments will provide mater-
ial enough for a separate column.
As a general statement, however, the
trend has ben toward refinement of
music within the limits of its
its essential nature—that is, a strong
family to the Negro
blues. The inclination has been away
from the once-prevalent attempt to
reconcile the big beat and older pop-
ular musica venture which led to
such nonsense as the Bobby Vee-
Paul Anka style of trrusic Today's

Yalies Ban Women;
We Welcome Them
For Gridiron Frolic

The administration of august and venerable Yale Univer-
sity decided recently that women add little to football games.
Eight stunning young ladies from Connecticut College for
Women were formally relieved of cheerleading duties after just
one performance at the Yale-Columbia game. Not that the girls

violated in any way traditional New England primness.
after all Yale is the male’s domain.*—— : —

Generals Meet

Why, the Old Blues screamed and
the current Elis were flabergasted.
Apparently, women at Yale are a
new experience.

If Yalies and women don’t mix
all that well, Washington and Lee
men have always found the combi-
nation arresting, in the least. Women
have established themselves as an
integral part of Washington and Lee
life and the W&L Gentleman has
accepted that fact with characteristic
aplomb, not to mention commanding

prowess.
Saturdays at Wilson Field, for
those few who consider football

games an esesntial part of a date’s
itinerary, are brightened by the
freshly scrubbed faces of cheerlead-
ers from Southern Sem. (Yes, Yale
they are females.) Sponsored by the
Varsity Club, the girls sport tradi-
tional W&L blue and white, while
exhorting the football Generals to
victory, a rare commodity these days.

Sem women have inspired W&L
football teams for the past three
years. Annual elections were once
held on campus for cheerleaders, but
when the Varsity Club measured the
power of sex appeal on an athlete’s
performance, Semmies were invited
to lend their bountiful charm.

After securing the approval of
Southern Seminary’s administration,
the Varsity Club wisely left the se-
lection of the cheerleaders to the
girls themselves. Semmies now con-
sider Saturday afternoon vocalizing
at Wilson Field an important main-
stay of extracurricular life.

For each of the Generals’ four
home appearances this year, five
girls and two alternates have made
their way to Lexington. W&L’s foot-
ball team has remained largely un-
responsive thus far, riding a 2-5 rec-
ord, so six girls will cheer this Sat-
urday in the home finale against
Southwestern. They are: Ginny

Lynx In Last
Home Contest

Washington and Lee winds up the
1965 home schedule Saturday against
Southwestern University of Mem-
phis, Tennessee. The Generals will
be looking for their first College Ath-
letie Conference victory of the cur-
rent campaign. W&L goes into Sat-
urday’s game sporting, as the case
may be, an overall record of 2-5.
With a ledger of 0-2 in conference
play, the Generals have two games
remaining, both CAC contests.

Injuries have hurt the Generals
substantially this season. Tackles
Logan Bullitt, Charlie Myers, and
Jim Foley are on the disabled list
along with end Warren Stewart.
Linebacker Joe Miller was injured
in the Sewanee game but should be
ready Saturday.

“This the worst year for in-
juries since I’ve been here,” com-
mented Coach McLaughlin. “Hardly
a week goes by that someone else
doesn’t get hurt.”

is

Southwestern boasts a potent aerial
attack, averaging over thirty throws
per game and completing an impres-
sive 45 per cent of their passes. Lynx
quarterback Bruce Cook had com-
pleted 46 passes for 584 yards going
into last week’s game against Prin-
cipia. He passed for 336 yards to beat
Principia, 27-24. Bill Hendricks, his
principal receiver, can also pass.
Southwestern is a rollout team, but
runs the ball to the outside when
trapped.

According to Tri-Captain Billy
Andrews, “A team that throws that
much can never be counted out. Last

W&L’s corps of Southern Sem cheerleaders exhort the crowd to cheer the Generals. If the Friday sport’s staff
invitation is accepted, they will be joined next year by a band of exiles from Connecticut College for Women,
banished from Yale by a hard-hearted administration. In the meantime, the Semmies above will hold down the
fort at tomorrow’s home game with Southwestern.

By CHARLIE BENSINGER
Dear Mom and Dad,

A great new All-IM party idea—
just in from Indiana University on
the Lexington
Pony Express. It’s
called the Florida
Fling, and this is
how it goes.
| Everybody in

the house, or any
other large group,
puts either $5 or
$10 (determined
by the desired fin-
al amount) into
the pot, and then
gets a date for the
Florida Fling party. The highpoint
of the party is the drawing of a
name from the magic hat. The lucky
guy whose name is drawn wins a
free, all-expense paid weekend in
Florida for himself and for his
date to the party.

In Soccer

The Washington and Lee soccer
team nipped the University of Vir-
ginia’s ensemble Tuesday in Char-
lottesville. Brad Shinkle scored the
game’s only goal, assisted by Allan
Craig.

In a game marred by poor play,
Dave Redmond, Wes Horner, Fred
Skinner, and Richard Burruoughs
did well defensively for the Gen-
erals. Dave Kirkpatrick led W&L’s
offensive efforts with adept dribbling.
Poor timing and poor passing voided
several W&L scoring opportunities,
until Shinkle penetrated the Cavalier
goal in the third period.

The win over U.Va. gave the boot-
ers a second seed for the Virginia

The Virginia game Tuesday ended
the regular season for both teams.
The W&L victory was the first over
Virginia in five years, although the
Generals tied the Cavaliers in last

match on corner kicks.

The VISA tournament employs a
unique system of determining the
winning team in case of a tie. Two
five minute quarters, both in over-
time, are played. If the game still
remains tied, the team with the most
corner kicks wins. And so Virginia
captured the tourney last year.

faces its biggest job yet. W&L’s pass
defense has improved steadily. Last
Saturday it held Sewanee to a meag-
er 76 yards in the air, picking off two
errant throws.

“The improvement has been due
partly to the addition of Bryant
Kendrick in the backfield and the
way our line has been able to get
to the passer,” said McLaughlin.

This is the seniors’ last game on
Wilson Field, the realization of which
could provide the incentive neces-
sary to make their last home game
a victory. The Generals displayed one
of their best efforts last week against
Sewanee. Hopefully the momentum
will carry over on Saturday.

| says Kahn, “the author throws in a
lot of ridiculous words and actions,
The scenes don’t follow logically.
The dialogue is short and choppy.”

But although the dialogue is ap-
parently nonsense, Beckett uses it
to present his views of the human
condition, which is humorous, mov-
ing and profound, producing what
the Times of London calls “phrases
that come like a sharp stab of

Gives 2nd Speech
In duPont Hall

By JOHN CARRERE

Author David Stacton will present
the second of three lectures tonight
in duPont auditorium at 8:15 p.m.
He will speak on “How Writing Gets
' Written.”

Mr. Stacton was chosen by the
Glasgow Endowment Committee as
its visiting professor for 1965. The
program was started in 1957 by the
will of the late Arthur Graham
Glasgow, a distinguished engineer
and honorary Washington and Lee
alumnus. Mr. Stacton follows such
notables as Katherine Anne Porter
and Robert Penn Warren to the
W&L campus.

Mr. Stacton easily fulfills the
fund's single stipulation to “pro-
mote the art of expression by pen

 

and tongue.” A native of Nevada,
he was born in 1925 and educated
at Stanford and the University of

California at Berkeley. He has pro-
duced in many of the writing forms

including the novel, short stories,
verse, biography, and history
His books include A Ride on a

Tiger (biography), The World on
the Last Day (history), An Unfa-
miliar Country (verse); and (novels)
Delores, A Fox Inside, The Self-
Enchanted, Remember Me, On a Bal-
cony, Segaki, A Dancer in Darkness,
A Signal Victory, The Judges of
the Seeret Court, Tom Fool, Sir Wil-
liam, Laliyuga, and People of the
Book.

His latest work is a history of th
Bonaparte family which will be pub-
by Simon & Schuster this

Kahn says that “we must have a
good show here,” and that he expects
good performances from each of the
cast.

He reemphasized the importance of
making reservations early, pointing
out that as all students have season
tickets seats are likely to sell out
early.

In addition to marking the group’s
debut under Kahn and its first pro-
duction of a full-length Absurdist
play, Waiting for Godot will also be
the first show presented since the

Autumn Issue Of Ariel Contains

Student Fiction,

An interview with David Stacton,
four short stories and poetry by
four student writers will appear in
the autumn issue of Ariel, scheduled
for publication before Thanksgiving.

Talk with Stacton

The Stacton interview, by Ariel
editor Grayson Powell, records the
noted author's comments on _ his
career as a novelist and his evalua-
tions of trends in current American
writing.

“Mr. Stacton was very critical of
the frequent occurence of phony
guilt feelings in recent American
fiction,” Powell said, “and he was
equally as enthusiastic about those
writers who, although in a minority,
are in opposition to this trend.”

Fiction

Reviews, Poetry

sists of Jerry Coffman's “Elmo,”
about a college freshman with a very
admirable claim to fame; and Scott
Tappan’s “Rag Doll,” about the in-

Also included are Richard Simon's
“Summer Friends,” about boyhood
companions who outgrow their
friendship; and Frank Q. Jones's
“Into a Dream,” which contains,
among other things, a unique de-
scription of the process of urination.

Local Orchestra Being Organized
By Rockbridge Citizens & Students

A “Rockbridge Chamber Music
Society Orchestra” may become
reality in the Lexington area before
long. This impressive epithet is the
title suggested by Professor Robert
Stewart, head of Washington and
Lee's music department, for a new
group of musicians now being
formed. The primary function of the
group will to provide musical
support for the local production of
the Pirates of Penzance in the spring

However, Stewart hopes that
after the Gilbert and Sullivan play,
the orchestra will continue on a
permanent basis, The spring pro-

al

duction will serve as a spring-
board for the creation of a local
chamber of music society.

Stewart, who would serve as the
group's director, stated the society
would have several purposes. It
would be an outlet for local talent
people who in Stewart's words “en-
joy playing” could meet periodical-
ly and pursue their common in-
terest in music, The orchestra would
serve as a “musical pool” from which

churches and other organizations
could draw musicians for special
functions. Also, it would give its

members the opportunity of playing

small concertos within the group

Stewart expects to have about
35 members in the society, “Many
people have already expressed a
| great interest,” Stewart said, Musi-
cally inclined townspeople, W&L
and VMI students and faculty, and
local high school students and mu-
sic teachers will be among the
orchestra's members.

Professor Gunn has circulated an
extended summary of the progress
made to date in the Self-Study of
the School of Commerce and Admin-
istration.

In addition to a general distribu-
tion to all members of the faculty
and staff, copies were mailed to
members of the student body execu-
tive committee and to each frater-
nity president, and copies were dis-
tributed to editors of both editions
of the Ring-tum Phi. Also copies
are available to individual students
through Dear. Adams’ office in New-
comb Hall

The summary will provide a basis
for open discussion relative to the
scope and content of the Commerce
School self-study process so far.

Series of Meetings

Professor Gunn's meetings will be
the first of a series of such discus-
sions aimed at providing an oppor-

better acquaint themselves with the
self-study process and to make their

In subsequent weeks, other discus-

related to the College, the School

Academic Services, Student Life,
Administrative Services and othe:

ters in the final Self-Study Report,
due for completion in October, 1966

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che King-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Friday Edition

People in Gien Houses...

The Sunday supplement of the Washington Post contained
a story on the Washington and Lee Department of Journalism
and Communications in which the Ring-tum Phi was the target
of some rather unkind remarks. In the light of the Post’s
usual reputation for factual reporting it is somewhat shocking
to find what amounts to a journalistic diatribe based on sub-
jectivity and departmental prejudice. The offensive comments
as they appeared in the Potomac Magazine were as follows:

Some of its conservatism (Dept. of Journalism) has
spilled over to the sprightly Ring-tum Phi, a twice-a-
week campus publication that is quick to attack policies
of the school president and the laggards of the varsity
football team with equally unabashed and occasionally
unsubstantiated fervor. This publication does not come
under the jurisdiction of the journalism department
which, in the minds of some, is so much the pity.

Mr. Paul Herron, editor of the Post supplement, presum-
edly gathered his information without consulting either editor
of the Ring-tum Phi during his recent campus visit. He ob-
viously relied on the colored opinions of the Department of
Journalism for his evaluation of our newspaper. It is no secret
that the Ried Hall clique has a thoroughly condescending at-
titude toward the journalistic quality of the Ring-tum Phi. It
should be noted at this point, in the same spirit of subjectivity,
that these sentiments are reciprocated in full.

In addition to this oversight in Mr. Herron’s research, we
should like to comment on the validity of his ill-chosen remarks.
The function of a relevant campus newspaper is, as we see it,
to provide a lively and responsible forum for student discussion.
A student publication which merely parrots the platitudes of
the administration or the hackneyed slogans of uninformed
students ceases to render a meaningful contribution to the
University.

There are few, if indeed any, sacred cows on the Washing-
ton and Lee campus—not even the “policies of the President
or the laggards of the football team.” Informed, intelligent,
and responsible criticism is a fundamental element of every
newspaper. The kind of “unabashed fervor” Mr. Herron talks
about is certainly a credit to any newspaper, but the “‘occasion-
ally unsubstantiated fevor” of which he speaks smacks of
subjective judgment which has no place in a reputable journal.

The several inaccuracies in Mr. Herron’s article are further
indication of his carelessness. These include the mis-titling of
the department chairman as a “‘dean,”

sort of quibbling characteristic of exacting editorial appraisal.

Although the Department of Journalism and Communica-
tions may view the Ring-tum Phi as journalistic travesty, it is
apparent that the University has found it wise to leave the
publication of the paper in the hands of students rather than
subject it to the control of a particular department. This in-
dependence assures every student of an opportunity to partici-
pate including those students enrolled in the Department of
Journalism who a are conspicuous by their absence.

W&L gentleman, if he ever really
existed, is obsolete, vestigial, dead.
While the image of the gentleman
is still promoted at W&L his exist-
ance is maintained only by a rear

anachronistic each year. His
existence now serves only to shackle
and hinder education at W&L.
Original Concept of Value
The gentleman must have been
born of our heritage from Robert E.
Lee. The original concept of the
gentleman was probably of value for
Lee was an admirable man. But in
his slow evolution the gentleman has
been blended with other ideas until
today he is a Prostitute.

 

 

The modern W&L gentleman

ap-
pears to be descended from the
Southern Gentleman known earlier

in this century. According to Ralph
McGill in The South and Souther-
ner, “He was a pleasant fellow...,
who cultivated a drawl and empha-
sized good manners. These Southern-
ers made really superior weekend
guests in the twenties. In the roof
gardens, and later in the nightclubs,
they could be very picturesque by
covertly requesting the band to play
‘Dixie’ and then giving the rebel yell
when the galloping swing of it be-
gan. At college they were more often
viewed as charming rather than
bores.”

From Ivan Bunin’s “Gentleman

acquired a certain materialistic class
consciousness. More recently he has
the qualities of the stud.
Our gentleman is now renouned too

nique,

adopted

Urbane and Witty

The Washington and Lee gentle-
man of today little resem-
blance to the aristocratic intellectual
he pretends to be. He is urbane, wit-
ty, amicable, splendid at cocktails,
and delightful at dinner. He has no
rough edges; he is well-rounded; he

bears

has no salient features to disturb
those he meets. He does not rock the
boat, but he blends beautifully. The

W&L gentleman will take no stands
heed no ealls,

’
champion no causes.
He to flow with the tepid
currents of the status quo.

No W&L gentleman can afford to

ls content

hecome enthusiastic about anything,
for to show fevor or devotion would
be to destroy the placid exterior he

cultivates. He is neither positive nor
negative but is blandly blase.

The W&L gentleman had a place

reserved in the United States of the
1920's. For some life was then a lark.
The nation was prosperous, protect-
ed, isolated and oblivious to those
forces working around it that would
eventually shatter the serenity and
frolicsome frenzy it enjoyed. When
the party was over, the U.S. found
itself involved in and responsible to
the world around it
Image Is Sacred Cow
Te ick the W&L gentleman is
» attack a sacred cow, but a hollow
one; for his most remarkable feature
that he does not exist. The gra-
ciou vell-mannered, Southern
gen nan has disappeared, and his
modern W&L counterpart has gone
too. No fraternity or individual can
lee! maligned if the gentleman is at-
cked cause no example of him
can be found except in our minds.
The W&L students know the gentle-
man i myth, although many are

The student at Washington and
Lee knows he no different than

may be somewhat better dressed;

Anthony Leads W&L To Ist CAC Win

Senior Fullback Goes For 173;

Increases Season

By CHARLIE FRERET

Saturday proved to be just a case
of too much John Anthony for
Southwestern as he scored three
touchdowns while gaining 173 yards
on 36 carries. Anthony’s antics led
Washington and Lee to its first con-
ference win of the season—a 26-13
victory over the Lynx.

W&L took the opening kickoff,
but was unable to move. South-
western got the ball on the W&L
40 yard line. Apparently headed for
a score, Southwestern saw its drive
thwarted when Bryant Kendrick in-
tercepted a pass on the end line of
the endzone.

On W&L’s first play following
this interception Anthony fumbled
and Southwestern recovered on
the Generals’s 25 yard line. Once
again Kendrick took matters into
his own hands as he intercepted
another pass on a diving catch,
This interception doubled his total
steals for the year.

A few minutes later safety Larry
Craig took a Lynx punt on his 23
yard line and sped 40 yards down
the sidelines to give W&L a first
down on the Southwestern 37 yard
line. On the next play quarterback
Andy Bloom threw 34 yards to Rob
Reading who was knocked out of
bounds at the 3 yard line. Anthony
then smashed off tackle for the first
of his three touchdowns, and Skip
Jacobsen’s extra point made the
score 7-0.

In the second period Southwestern
put it first points on the scoreboard
Scott Arnold cut behind the
safetyman to take a 40 yard touch-
down pass from quarterback Bruce
Cook. The extra point tied the game
at 7-7.

Rudd Smith took the ensuing kick
and returned it to the 40 yard line.
A Bloom to Smith pass sandwiched
between plunges by Anthony
brought the ball to the 29 yard line.
Three plays later, Anthony brought
the ball to the 29 yard line. Three
plays later, Anthony, having picked
up a first down at the 29 on an off
tackle play, decided to try the left
end of the line and found it to his
liking as he bulled 21 yards into the
end zone. Anthony knocked over
the last two defenders in his path

Again Jacobsen converted and the
score read W&L 14, Southwestern 7.

But Southwestern stormed back
on the strength of Cook’s passing
to put the ball on the W&L 2 yard
line. On the next play halfback
Mike Whitaker crossed the goal
line to cut the W&L lead to one
point. on the try for the extra
point big Jerry Croston managed
to get a hand on the ball to de-
flect it and preserve the Generals’
slim margin. As it turned out,
Croston’s hand was enough to pro-
vide victory.

With 80 seconds left in the half,
Southwestern gained control of the

W&L goal line. Cook sent his big
end Arnold down the sideline, but
Billy Andrews, giving away 9 inches
in height, leaped high in the air to
take the ball out of Arnold’s hands.
Thus, W&L had its 14-13 lead as it
went to the dressing room.

‘oth teams settled down to play some
sturdy defense. Midway through the
| third period W&L gained possession
|near midfield and began to march.
With Anthony’s running and Bloom’s
passing W&L reached the South-
western 15 where on a crucial third
down play Bloom hit Tersh Baker
to give W&L first and goal on the
three. Three runs netted two yards,
but on fourth down Bloom decided
to play the percentages and sent
Anthony off tackle for the touch-
down and a 20-13 lead.

Early in the final quarter
Generals’ offense clicked again
they marched for their fourth and
final seore of the day. Anthony
swept around left end for 16 yards
to the 20 yard line where, hemmed
in, he pitched out to halfback Tom
Pittman who picked up another six
yards to the 14. Anthony carried
again to the seven. The Lynx’s de-
fense, anticipating an Anthony carry,
bunched to stop him, but Bloom
faked to his fullback and flipped a
pass to Baker who had gotten behind

Finish Season With Seven Wins

The Washington and Lee soccer
squad culminated its winning season
this weekend by participating in
the annual state tournament. The
Generals were beaten in the first
round by Randolph-Macon on total
corner kicks in a game ending as
a 0-0 tie, and defeated Virginia Poly-
technic Institute 2-1 in the consola-
tion round.

W&L, seeded second in the state,
played their roughest game of the
season in losing to the Yellow Jackets |
of Randolph-Macon. The deciding |
factor of the tie contest was the op- |
position’s 6-5 lead in corner kicks
after overtime play was completed.
After regulation time the Generals |
had led 5-4 in corner kicks.

Both offense and defense were
well balanced in this game, with
the offense featuring an aggressive,
persistent effort and the defense al-
lowing the Yellow Jackets very few
shots at the W&L goal.

By virtue of this loss; W&L was
pitted against the Gobblers of VPI

 

Saturday night in a_ consolation
game.
By attaining a victory in this

seasonal finale, the Generals closed
their record at 7-3-2.

Fechney tallied the first goal of
the game in the third period. How-
ever, VPI came back in the fourth
quarter to tie the contest. Finally,
in the second overtime period Hen-
ry scored the decisive goal with an
assist by Kirkpatrick. This triumph
left W&L with a third place finish
in the tournament.

As the season ended, Brad Shinkle
and Fred Skinner were named to
lead the 1966 soccer team as captains.
Both of these players have consti-

Cannon Goes 80 Yards Res TD;
Brigadiers Finish With Victory

By MARK EAKER

Washington and Lee’s freshman
football team climaxed one of its
most successful seasons in recent
years with an impressive 13-0 vic-
tory over Staunton Military Aca-
demy Friday. The victory was the
Brigadiers’ fourth of the season
against two defeats. All four of the
victories were won at Wilson Field,
and in each of the games the oppo-
sition failed to score.

The Staunton game proved to be
identical to the three previous home
victories. W&L used a solid defense
to bottle up SMA, and a well-bal-
anced offense to score.

The first W&L touchdown came
late in the second quarter. Quarter-
back Alan Tomlin connected with
halfback Pat Howell for a thirty yard
pass play that took the ball to the
SMA 28 yard line. Then Tomlin ran
out of the pocket, weaving his way

to the one yard line. On the next
play Tomlin took the ball in for the
score and added the point after, giv-
ing W&L a 7-0 lead.

The second half opened with SMA
being unable to move the ball. W&L
took over after a punt on the Gen-
erals twenty. Dee Cannon, with the
explosive running that characterizes
his play, broke through the SMA
line for 80 yards and a touchdown.
Cannon was able to run the distance
because of a picture block by Fran
Lawrence which removed the last
defender from the play. The try for
two points failed, and the score re-
mained at 13-0.

As in previous games the defense
was led by John Wolf, Lawrence,
Britt McJunkin, Don Sharpe, Scott
MacKenzie, and John Harris. The
offense was paced by Tomlin, Can-
non, and Dick Kinney, all stars in
previous weeks, as well as Howell.

The Southern Seminary cheer-
leaders also made the Post in the
sports section. The story was by-
lined for the Associated Press so
perhaps the Semies received some
sort of national coverage. Now every
high school cheer leader in the coun-
try wants to come to ye olde Valley
of Virginia.

Seriously, one has to give the
cheerleaders credit. To stand out
there week after week in front of a
totally unresponsive audience takes
no small amount of nerve.

has just been released. It’s entitled,
“My Name Is Barbra, Two. ...,”

to it brings to memory a definite
truism about Barbra. One person
criticized her saying that she occas-
ionally lost her “cools” when she
sang. The reply was, “Man, when
Barbra sings a lot of people loose
their cools.”

Saturday night ended the engage-
ment of “Lord Jim” at one of the
local movie emporiums. Let’s not
concern ourselves with a critique of
the movie and whether Joseph Con-
rad is rolling in his grave. But the

where for that matter.

ODK Should Accept

Here’s hoping that ODK accepts
the Executive Committee’s sugges-
tions for modification and strength-
ening of its Leadership Forum. It
will be an invaluable aid to the BC
and ease its overburdening work
load. More important, it would create
a more easily accessible forum for
debate of campus issues.

The Ring-tum Phi's original story
left the unfortunate impression that
the EC was dictating this change to
ODK. The EC simply does not have
any control over ODK. Despite any
hurt feeling, it is very desirous that
ODK accepts the EC’s suggestions.

for the extra point was unsuccessful,
but W&L had wrapped up the game,

Late in the game Southwestern
marched downfield, and Cook
launched a pass at his favorite tar-
get, Arnold. At this point Billy An-

interception at the 10 yard line to
seal W&L’s third victory in 8 games.

Commerce School Releases

Self Study Program Report

The School of Commerce and Ad-
ministration released Wednesday to
both faculty and students a prelim-
inary report of the self study pro-
gram conducted within it. Under-
taken in conjunction with the Uni-
versity wide self study effort, the
Commerce School's inquiry has ben
underway for almost a year.

The immediate purpose of the self
study, as delineated by Professor
John M. Gunn, Jr., analyst for the
School of Commerce, centers upon
fulfilling the accreditation require-
ments of the Southern Association of
Colleges and Schools. A_ regional
agency recognized by the National
Commission on Accrediting, the As-
sociation demands of schools seeking

ODK, EC Agree To Accept
Modification of Leadership
Forum; VP’s Excluded

The Executive Committe’s plan
for the re-organization of the ODK
Leadership Forum has been accepted
by ODK with little modification,
Student Body President Fred Mindel
announced Tuesday.

The only change voted by ODK
and accepted by the E.C| at its
Tuesday meeting is in the structure
of the Forum’s Council. Under this
revision, undergraduate Class Vice-
Presidents wili not sit on the Coun-
cil; three instead of two officers of
ODK will—reducing the size of the
Council from nineteen to fourteen.
Others who will be part of the
Council are the four undergraduate
Class and three law Class presidents,
two representatives from the E.C.,
one from the Independent Union,
and one from the IFC. The Council
will act as the supervisory body of
the Forum proper, which will be
open to all students and faculty
interested. In addition to deciding
which of the topics suggested to it
by students, faculty, campus organ-
izations, and the E.C. merit discus-

accreditation a self study program
conducted once every ten years.
Professor Gunn was quick to point
out that neither the University nor
the School of Commerce would limit
the aims and extent of the self study
to the specific requirements of the
Association.

Gunn Discuses Issues

In a series of public meetings
with faculty and students, Professor
Gunn discussed the issues and im-
plications raised by the report. The
meetings were directed toward in-
forming particularly the
body with the problems encounter-
ed and presenting students with the
opportunity of offering solutions and
suggestions. Only five students,
though, appeared at each of the ses-
sions.

The report, itself, is divided into
four principal areas of consideration.

The first area deals with objec-
tives of the School of Commerce. As
expressed in the preliminary report,
the School basically “strives to blend
academic excellence and moral in-
tegrity, fortified by self-confidence,
self-discipline, and large vision, and
enriched with taste, courtesy, and a
touch of graciousness.” The faculty
believes that the educational exper-
ience ought to be viewed in a very
“broad context.” Professor Gunn
stressed, however, that the objectives
of the School of Commerce ulti-
mately correspond with the Univer-
sity’s objectives. As of yet, the
University Self Study Committee has
not issued a definite report on those
objectives.

Graduate Records Analyzed

The second area of examination
centers upon the students enrolled
in the School. The most recent data
indicates that approximately 75 per
cent of its graduates continue their
education on the graduate school
level. Although a small percentage
of men enter graduate study in one
of the fundamental intellectual dis-
ciplines offered by the Commerce

EC Ap

Three committee appointments, a
report from the Library Committee,
and discussion of the Saturday
classes poll highlighted this week’s
meeting of the EC,

Freshman Jack Carithers, a Phi
Gam pledge from Jacksonville, was
named to the Assimilation Commit-
tee. In his statement to the EC.,
Carithers commented that he would
like to see the basic traditions of
the University continued, with per-
haps a liberalization of the conven-
tional dress regulations at night. Ap-
pointed to the University Commit-
tee on Athletics were Chuck Long,
Beta senior from Dallas, and Lee
Johnson, Delt senior of Louisville.
The Committee on Athletics, com-
posed of two student body members,
five faculty members and two alum-
ni, schedules all intercollegiate sports
activities, submits an athletic bud-
get to the Board of Trustees, and as-
sists the Administration in the selec-
tion of coaches and athletic direc-
tors.

A progress report from Library
Committee chairman Randy Chit-
wood noted that students have been
taking good advantage of the new
policy of keeping the stacks open
during dinner. Within two weeks,
the report stated, the Library will
begin opening earlier on Sundays,
probably at 1.30. Presently, it opens
at 3,00. The Library Committee is
expecting recommendations for new
activity and a specific determination
of the question of the areas of its
jurisdiction in the forthcoming Self-
Study Committee. Chitwood further
reported that the Library Commit-
tee would like to institute a used-
book exchange second semester, as a
more efficient and organized means
of determining who has which
second-hand look to sell than present
practice of posting notices on the
ODK bulletin board, and to bring
higher returns for books than are
given when they are sold to pub-
lishers’ representatives through the
Co-op. In matters of discipline, the
Library Committee is considering
possible higher fines, since com-
plaints are increasing, especially in
respect to reserved books, with the
possibility of referring flagrant vio-
lators to the E.C. A suggestion box
has been placed in the library, but
will shortly be replaced by a larger,
more noticeable one.

Discussing the Saturday classes
poll conducted a week ago Wednes-
day, the E.C. decided that since less
than half of the student body voted
at all, the results are not valid
enough representation of general
student opinion to interpret. Of the
473 per cent of the students vot-
ing, 275 (43 per cent) were in favor

of abolishing all Saturday classes;
358 (57 per cent) wanted to retain
them. Richard Nash, Sophomore E.C.
representative and Chairman of the
Committee investigating the Satur-
day class question, noted that many
students felt that the question pre-
sented by the E.C. was worded in a
negative way, but the E.C. had not
intended to give such an impression.
Other E.C. members felt that the
poll might have asked for reasons for
each vote, for opinions, and for other
ideas and alternative suggestions.
Junior class representative Bob Lee
suggested that the E.C. contact other
schools which have a five-day week
to see how the obstacles of schedul-
ing were overcome. E.C. President
Fred Mindel appointed Nash to
head a follow-up committee to pur-
sue the idea. Students will be re-
cruited to work with Nash on the
committee, but not until after
Thanksgiving, because as Nash com-
mented, if work is begun immediate-
ly, students will exclaim, “A new
committee—good, good, but I'm go-
ing home Wednesday!”

The last business of the evening
was the delivery by member Bill
Jeffres of the “Anecdote of the
Week.” Fred Mindel announced that
he is preparing his own anecdote, to
be recited at the next meeting.

Before the meeting was officially
brought to order, a heated debate
was held about members wearing or
not wearing robes for their Calyx
picture. Leading the Pro-Robe Fac-
tion were Richard Nash and Dave
Marchese. The No-Robe opposition,
however, led by Mindel and Joe
Framptom, won its victory when
Framptom asked, “Why wear robes?

(Nine Member Board

To Provide Advice

By SAM McCHESNEY

The Mock Republican National
Convention Interim Co-Ordinating
Committee has chosen nine promi-
nent Republicans to serve on its
National Advisory Board for the up-
coming 1968 Republican Mock Con-
vention.

The members of the Advisory
Board are Bill Brock, Congressman
from the third district of Tennessee;
Everett M. Dirksen, Senator from
Illinois and Senate Minority Lead-
er; William Miller, former Congress-
man and Chairman of the Republi-
can National Committee; William
Scranton, Governor of Pennsylvania;
Robert Smylie, Governor of Idaho;
Mark Hatfield, Governor of Oregon;
Melvin Laird, Congressman from the
seventh district of Wisconsin; Gerald
Ford, Congressman from the fifth
district of Michigan and Minority
leader of the House of Representa-
tives; and Richard H. Poff, Repre-
sentative from the Sixth District of
Virginia.

There are four reasons for organ-
izing this Mock Convention National
Advisory Board. H. Davis Mayfield,
Chairman of the Interim Co-Ordinat-
ing Committee of the Mock Conven-
tion, said as one reason that “our
1968 Convention can be more re-
spected, accurate, realistic, and suc-
cessful if we can depend on the ad-
vice and suggestions of these out-
standing gentlemen over a period of
three years.”

Secondly, the mere use of these
names enables the Mock Convention
to enlist the support of less promi-
nent members of the Republican
Party. The use of such names will
also assist the public relations aspect
of this Mock Convention. News-
papers will be more prone to publi-
cize the Convention knowing that
these nine Republicans are support-
ing the Convention's endeavors.

Lastly the National Advisory
Board will help the Convention to
attract two outstanding republicans
to speak each year during the three-
year interim period.

Besides being a veteran of seven
terms in the House of Representa-
tives, Laird is currently Chairman
of the House Republican Conference,
one of the top leadership positions
in the Republican hierarchy. Made
up of all Republican members of
the House of Representatives, the
Conference Committee is the high-

Special M ecting
Of Publications
Board is Called

A special meeting of the Publica-

afternoon, at which time Journalism
Professor Paxton Davis was expec-
ed to lodge a formal complaint with
the Board protesting certain infer-
ences drawn from Tuesday Ring-tum
Phi editor Mike Hash’s editorial
printed earlier this week, entitled
“People in Glass Houses...”

The editorial commented on an
article which appeared in last Sun-
day's Potomac Magazine supplement
to the Washington Post, written by
Paul Herron, editor of the Potomac.
The article was apparently neither
entirely accurate nor complimentary,
although unintentionally so, to both
the Department of Journalism and to
the Ring-tum Phi. Hash’s editorial
response to the article observed that
“Herron ...obviously relied on the
colored opinions of the Department
of Journalism for his evaluation of
our newspaper” and continued, “It is
no secret that the Reid Hall clique
has a thoroughly condescending at-
titude toward the journalistic qual-
ity of the Ring-tum Phi.”

"..» The Greatest Enterprise in the World”

 

Humphreys Outlines Political Life

Raymond V. Humphreys, the Di-
rector of Political Education and
Training Division of the National
Republican Party, spoke last Thurs-
day night about the “Noblest Career.”

Before an audience of about 100)
students, Humphreys illustrated the
sacrifices, rewards, and qualities of |
political life. “This is a challenge.” |
he said, “but not for weaklings.” |
“Government is the greatest enter-
prise in the world.” “We've got to
look to you (college students),” he |
reminded the audience

 

Due to its very nature, politics is |
a risky profession. Politicians are, ac- |
cording to the speaker, “people who |
are willing to gamble a little bit.”
Quoting from Andrew Oliver, a Bos-
ton patriot of the Eighteenth Cen-
tury, Humphreys stated, “Politics is
the most hazardous of all profes-
sions. There is no other in which a
man can hope to do so much geod
to his fellow creatures—and neither
is there any in which, by mere loss
of nerve, he may do as widespread
harm. With all its temptations and
degradations that beset it, Politics is
still the noblest career any man can
choose.”

Turning his focus to the Republi-
can Party, Humphreys examined the
history of the party and brought to
light its precedent as a progressive
and conscientious party. Te enum-
improvements

 

erated the many in

 

government brought about in this

 

century by the GOP administrations.

Preceding Humphreys’ speech,
during the monthly business meet-
ing, President Roger Wallace report-
ed on the YR contributions to the
Virginia campaign. This year the

 

YR's provided over $450 in contri-
butions and 150 man-hours to the
campaign. Allen Rains, a junior from
Vienna, Virginia, was selected YR
of the month for his outstanding
contribution to the campaign effort

Friday Edition

Misdirected Blame

People in Glass Houses Revisited .. .

 

The Tuesday Editions editorial on the recent article in the
Sunday supplement of the Washington Post has caused quite
a furor on both the first and second floors of Reid Hall. It
seems that a member of the Journalism Department felt the
charges leveled against the J-school unjust, even to the extent
of demanding a Publications Board meeting on the subject
this afternoon at 4:15.

It is our understanding from the author of the editorial,
Mike Hash, that this member of the faculty of the Journalism
School called him on Wednesday, demanding a public apology
for the editorial comment which shows one of General Lee’s
pet projects in a rather unfavorable light.

Hash offered unlimited space for a letter or article in either
edition of the Ring-tum Phi in which the editorial could be re-
butted. He also offered to publish a statement to the effect that
the Department of Journalism and Communications neither
encouraged or promoted the sentiments expressed by Mr. Paul
Herron in his recent article. Both these offers were unaccept-
able to the faculty member.

We can understand the department’s concern, but feel that
Mr. Hash was entirely justified in his right to make his com-
ments Tuesday. We also believe that Hash made every effort
possible to give equal space to the J-school.

We question where Mr. Herron, author of the Post article,
got his information about the Ring-tum Phi. Thus far, how-
ever, no one has admitted to disclosing the tainted information
to Mr. Herron, but we do feel that Mr. Hash had justification
for his, more or less, subjective opinion concerning the origin
of the controversial statement, which later has been cleared of
J-school blame.

It is a well known fact that no love has ever existed be-
tween the students in the two groups. For example, page 22
of the Journalism Handbook points this fact out in the same
type innuendos Mr. Hash was attacked for using.

“The Department has no managerial connection
with, nor responsibility for, student body publications,
the Ring-tum Phi, Southern Collegian, and Calyx. It
desires no responsibility for them unless it can in fact
control and supervise the publications and use them as
workshop projects with professional standards in con-
tent and operation related to the realities of profession-
al, non-campus publishing. As the university has a tra-
dition of “independent” student publications (although
they are not actually immune to administrative con-
trol), use of the publications as training tools is pre-
cluded.”

It is our firm belief that neither the students, faculty, or
administration would like to see the Ring-tum Phi become a
“training tool” of the Department of Journalism.

We also feel, in defense of the department, that if Mr.
Herron were a student here, he would have failed his assign-
ment with flying colors. It was an unfortunate story which
shows Washington and Lee in a bad light, but if anyone should
receive criticism for the gross inaccuracies connected with the
story, it is the Washington Post, specifically Mr. Herron, and
not Mr. Hash.

The result of Mr. Herron’s handiwork here has placed a
lot of innocent people in an embarrassing position. Mr. Hash
possibly should have checked the validity of his statement be-
fore publication, and, by the same token, the journalism pro-
fessor possibly should have reacted more temperately to the
editorial attack which was in no way maliciously directed to
him nor any members of the J-school faculty or administration.

Stuart Reviews “Waiting for Godot”;
Praises Baker, Williams and Direction

By DABNEY STUART
Instructor in English

Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Go-
dot can be a bewildering play. The
reason for this is, I think, that it is
a “literary” play; that is, it depends
on literary tradition, and not simply
a tradition of dramatic literature, for
its effectiveness. This can be speci-
fied in three ways.

Firstly, the play embodies a vision
of man’s place in the world that is
more or less peculiar to the twentieth
century. This vision receives clear
expression in the works of Nietzsche,
Sartre, Dostoyevsky and Camus to
name Beckett's most obvious ante-
cedents with respect to ideas.

This tradition, which, as these
names suggest, is European and not
American, stresses the “death” of
God, or at least His disappearance

 

from man’s world-view, and the

consequent isolation of human be-
ings who longer find comfort and
solace for the tribulations of this
world in terms of the promise of
another. As Beckett dramatizes this
vision in Godot men have ceased to
be pilgrims journeying through one
world to another, and have become
instead waiters, condemned to one
life which, simply, ends. This world
is all they’ve got.

The dramatic tension inherent in
this predicament depends on the
expectations left over from a con-
ception of life’s meaning that is no
longer sufficient, and the absence of
substantial fulfillment of those ex-
pectations. Vladimir and Estragon
still think in Christian terms, still
expect some intervention from a
“Godot” which will “save” them, but,
at the same time, have no confidence
that this intervention will occur. In

 

“A Ticket to Anyplace”

Fleischer Hits

By DAVID FLEISCHER
As I popped another “dex,” I
came to the understanding (“dex”
makes one think 25 per cent clearer)

 

that the good
old red - blooded
American public

(a phrase that can
best be ranked in
the same category
with “motherism”
and “Better dead
than red”) has be-
come creators of a
“pill - poppers -
paradise.” This
holds especially
true for the col-
lege student. He has become associ-
ated with pills to keep him awake,
pills to put him to sleep, pills to
speed up his “inners,” and pills to
slow down the “inners” of his local
lass.

The trend seems to be continuing
in this direction. The United States
Space program can stash all the de-
light of a steak dinner into a tiny
capsule. (It is interesting to note that
the Commons has not yet succeeded
in “stashing” all the delight of a
steak dinner into a real steak.) In
contrast, dietary research can by vir-
ture of a similarly shaped pill, re-
move one’s appetite. (In this field the
Commons has attained greater suc-
cess.) There are now in existence
pills to cure everything from laryn-
gitis to lumbago. We have pills to
make us grow big and strong. We
have pills to seramble the precious
bodily fluids. And we even have
pills to take when other pills do
not do the job. Pills have become
so popular that you can even buy
pillboxes with pictures of Ringo
Starr on the outside. (Is this not a
sign of acceptance?)

 

 

Pill Paradise

Perhaps even a greater mark of
the acceptance of the pill is display-
ed in the embodiment of the “pill
game.” (If we can make a game out
of something, it’s usually pretty
much accepted—the “in” game, cha-
rades, pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey.) 1|

 

fact, the evidence—the boy’s re-
ports—indicate that they will wait
without end. The best they can do
is “pass the time,” bored, despair-
ing, yet hanging on in a_ world
where putting on one’s boots and sit-
ting down become acts of supreme
interest.

Secondly, the play depends for
much of its “meaning” on a tradi-
tion of dramatic literature. But,
whereas Beckett employs certain
ideas in the vision the play com-
municates, he works against tradi-
tional uses of the stage. The wall
between audience and actors is brok-
en down, for example, and much of
what happens on stage is intended

at some parties in Paris this summer | ,

called the “pill game.” Each guest
is required to bring two different
types of pills to the party—“dex,”
bennies, sominex, birth control pills,
weight control pills, Salk oral vac-
cines, etc. The host places all of the
pills into a hat. Each guest while
blind-folded, draws two pills at ran-
dom.

The idea of dependence on pills
was first expounded by an eminent
Washington and Lee philosophy
professor. Anyone can obtain a pel-
let which can serve as a ticket to
and from anyplace from ecasty to
despair. Modern man seems to be
sloughing off his physical and mental
maintenance. I certainly am not op-
posed to medical and psychological
programs (that woud be un-Ameri-
can) but we seem headed for an age
of pill-ism. (It is characteristic of
“America” to put -“ism” on to the
end of every word that doesn’t
already have -“ism” on it.) The fu-
ture looks finster. Free will is be-
coming naught. Where can we find
the answer? There is only one man
among us all who seems to have the
answer. He has become the epitome
of tranquility. He is to radio what
Ted Mack (and Geritol) are to the
tube. He is to the nervous system
what Speedy (of Speedy Alka Selt-
zer) is to the digestive system. Any-
one would recognize his mellifluous
voice when he greets wou with—
“Hello, folks, I'm Galen Drake. Take

 

Mr. Stuart

to remaind us we are watching
somebody perform in a theater.

For instance, Vladimir goes off-
stage to urinate and Estragon calls
to him, “End of the corridor, on the
left,” jolting us out of the illusion
of a limited “scene”—outdoors some-
where, beside a tree—and reminding
us that we are in a building with
corridors and rooms. And bringing us
to ourselves. Vladimir's comments to
Estragon as he (Vladimir) peers

the same effect, and are more point-
edly critical.

Moreover, this technique has a
double effect. While it reminds us
we are in a theater, it also involves
us in the action on the stage. The
dramatie action spills over into the
audience. Brecht and Pirandello are
Beckett's models here.

Thirdly the play is as much about
language itself as about anything
else. This is clearest in Beckett's
use, and parody, of rhetoric. Lucky's
speech is a chaotic conglomeration of
textbook jargon about “big issues”
and social customs—“esse and posse”
(to be and not to be able), death,
digestion and defecation, golf, the

Graduates of Washington and
Lee's Commerce School have gener-
ally posted outstanding records in
many of the nation’s most distin-
guished business schools. The per-
formanee of the School's graduates
‘at Harvard's Business School, over
a period of many years, has been
particulary notable. Since 1961, men

Attrition Rate

The report takes cognizance of the
high rate of attrition within the
School of Commerce. Professor Gunn
pointed out that the cause of the
rate of attrition appears to be a lack
of motivation which seems related
to a lack of self-confidence. The
celebrated “sophomore slump” which
claims a significant number of those
leaving, or changing majors, is, ac-
cording to Mr. Gunn, “an inevitable
part of ecomplishing what a man
eomes to college for, namely to
conquer feelings of basic insecurity
and the lack of self-confidence.”

It is a reductio ad absurdum of
the kind of scholarship which ster-
ilizes the problems of living men
rather than solving them. Pozzo de-
scribes lyrically the twilight, and
then reveals he was performing, not
expressing himself. Vladimir, in an
articulate echoing of Lucky’s speech,
ponders, in formal oratory, the
need to act when opportunity pre-
sents itself, or be lost; and the
speech itself prevents him from do-
ing what he is talking about.

Finally, the play is fraught with
cliches that are revitalized, usually
ironically, by a new context. Pozzo’s
diminishing evaluation of “this gen-
eration” which ends in the vapid
phrase, “It is true, the population
has increased,” is an example of
this.

In these three respects, then—
Beckett's use of ideas, the stage, and
language—he demands that his au-
dience be widely read, experienced
theater-goers who are alive both to
traditions he is violating and to
certain habitual uses of words.

He also demands that we have
suffered and can laugh at ourselves.

The Troubadour Theater’s current
production of Waiting for Godot
does exciting justice to Beckett's
concerns. Though the performance I
saw was up and down—the second
act was markedly better than the
first—it was always interesting, re-
vealing that Mr. Lee Kahn ean give
consistent and strong direction to

a difficult play. The lighting was ex-

cellent and the set appropriately

austere.

Don Baker's performance (Lucky)
was the most even of the four major
parts. He handled his one oration
(a three page speech with no punc-
tuation) will, and controlled his
gestures and facial expressions in a
wonderfully varied, loose-jointed
way. Jeff Williams, whose timing
seemed a bit off in Act I, came back
strong in Act II and rendered a
poignant and perplexed Estragon.

Jake Duvall said his “Yes sirs”
and “No sirs” with an effective mix-
ture of bewilderment and fear. Lew
Davis (Vladimir and Jim Settle
(Pozzo) seemed to me to suffer
from the same problem, a lack of
voice modulation. Both of them came
on full blast and kept yelling;
though, again, they began in Act II
to vary both pitch and volume ef-
fectively.

In fact, if I have a quibble, it is
with the loudness which many of
the lines were spoken. Godot is a
quiet play which suffers when it is
shouted. Its terror and secarifying
beauty come across much better
when they are at odds with silence.
Vladimir's inaudible but perfectly
mouthed, “that you saw me,” near
the end of the play, was one of the
most moving lines in the perform-
ance.

 

Report

The curriculum in commerce and
business administration is a sound
one. In 1948, Harvard's graduate
School of Business organized its
program around functional fields
common to all businesses. In 1956,
Washington and Lee became one of
the first undergraduate schools in
the nation to adopt such an approach.

The need for an introduction to
the use of the electronic computer
in the management curriculum has
emerged as primarily important. The
curriculum has always been under
continuous review, and no additional
course of high priority has been
identified

The content of accounting courses
remains under frequent review,
keeping pace with changing prac-
tices. A proliferation of courses of-
fered in the department is regard-
ed as “superfluous.”

The report goes on to suggest bet-
ter maintenance and the enlargement
of the school’s library facilities, Spe-
cifieally, the report outlines the
need for a full-time librarian, addi-
tional shelf space, and study areas.

Professor Gunn stressed that no
conclusions as to the Commerce
School's self study have yet been
made, The final report of the Uni-
versity Self-Study Committee will
incorporate any conclusions and
recommendations

Although a significant part of the
jtatistieal data on the Commerce
Sehool has been collected, the most

however, Washington would retain
the second place slot outright with
a 3-1 mark while W&L would drop

Charlie Covers NL, CFL, Pool and I-M

By CHARLIE BENSINGER
Dear Mom and Dad,

Last week the baseball writers
of the National League cities voted
Willie Mays the MVP—the Most
Valued Player, not the most Valu-
able, We say this because of only one
thing—the record of Sandy Koufax.

Timeout...Koufax and Maruy
Wills did not collect one vote on
two of the twen-
ty ballots cast, and
each has ten
names on it. Could
these two perhaps
been the ballots of
SF sportswriters?
But then again,
Dodger-Giant re-
lations have never
been too friendly,
right Juan? Time-
Mics

Mays is great,
perhaps the best all-around ball-
player today, but if he didn’t hit it
out of the park, then McCovey did,
or Hart did, or Alou did, or almost
any other Giant regular did. And in
a line-up like the Giants’, there are
a lot of guys who can make the big
play (say, how come they didn’t win
the pennant?)

Bensinger

Koufax, however, is a Dodger, a
member of a team that hit far fewer
homers than did Mays and McCovey
alone. The Dodgers had to be lucky
to hit singles, much less score runs.
Yet Koufax won 26 games (for the
Giants, Reds, Pirates, or Braves he
would have won 30-plus; there can
be little doubt about this), but he
also held the staff together.

Mays hit more homers than any
one else this year. Koufax struck
out more batters than any one else
ever. Willie missed five games. Sandy
didn’t miss a turn. Willie hit for a
fairly high average as usual. Sandy
won the major league ERA crown, as
usual (four years in a row ain’t real
bad.)

Mays. They would have finished two
or three notches lower without him.
The Dodgers finished first with Kou-
fax. They wouldn’t have made the
first division without him. They
might even have challenged the
Mets.

A great player like Mays deserves
recognition, a great one like Koufax
the MVP. After all, doesn’t the
letter “V” stand for “Valuable?”

game with Phi Delt 7-7 by virtue of
an edge on first downs. However, it
isn’t over yet as the game was suc-
cessfully protested. It seems that
a ref measured a clipping penalty
from the line of scrimage instead of
from the point of clipping. A forty
yard penalty doesn’t help does it

today. At any rate Pi Phi was third
and ZBT fourth.

In wrestling, the winners were

Architect Slated To Check
Tentative Allocations
Within Two Weeks

By AL CEDARHOLM
Staff Reporter

According to Dean Atwod, the
Student Union Committee which has
previously made suggestions for the
proposed expanded Student Union
building has tentatively allocated
space for suggested additions and has
eliminated certain previous consider-
ations. However, Atwood said that
all allocations in this plan drawn
up by the committee were tentative
pending considerations by the Uni-
versity architect. The plans must be
checked for feasibility, first of all,
and secondly the architect must
check to see if the structure is even
architectually possible. According to
Atwood, the architect should be in
Lexington within two weeks,

Present Plans
In the present plans on the main
or second floor will be included a
room for the Executive Committee
with a separate entrance. There is to
be a chaplain’s office and chapel.

Parents’ Weekend Group
Is Appointed By IFC;
Blair Heads Unit

By BILL WILKERSON

The IFC has appointed a standing
committee on Parents Weekend of
students to consider and develop
plans for all future Parents’ Week-
ends. Bill Blair, Sigma Chi, from
Charlotte, N. C., was chosen to head
the group which will work with Mr
James W. Whitehead to discuss such
problems as the program of events
and the housing question. The IFC
has total responsibility for the week-
end, as a result of the decision of the
Parents’ Advisory Council.

Additional members of the
mittee include Tom Baremore, a Pi
Phi sophomore from Shreveport,
John Burk, a senior Kappa Sig from
Fort Worth, Robin Dyer, a DU from
Hinsdale, Illinois, and Jimmy Kier-
sky, a ZBT sophomore from Mem-
phis.

The remaining members are Jody
Luck, a Pi Phi junior from Manassas,
Virginia, Dick Penny, a Phi Kap
junior from Erlanger, Kentucky, and
Pete Van Dine, a junior from
Doylestown, Pennsylvania

The housing problem will be the
major obstacle to a successful
weekend, according to Blair. If
the parents of all four classes are
included as planned, Chairman
Blair says, “They would have to
come with the understanding that
they might have to stay as far
away as Roanoke.”

A Wise Decision

We note with satisfaction the appointment of a permanent
IFC Committee on Parents’ Weekend. This committee, headed
by sophomore Bill Blair, has its work cut out for the next year:
it has full responsibility for housing of the large number of
visitors expected at the 1966 Parents’ Weekend.

The IFC is to be commended for responding in this man-
ner to the resolution passed by the W&L Parents Advisory
Council, acceding to the IFC’s suggestion that freshman par-
ents be invited to future Parents’ Weekends. The new com-
mittee will have to arrange accommodations for an expected
1200 people, a task which swamped the Advisory Council and
the University Administration when freshman parents were last

invited in 1964.

Shouldering the responsibility for this difficult job is an-
other indication of the steady maturation and improvement of
the IFC as an efficient and viable instrument of student govern-

ment.

It is pleasing to see the IFC assume this greater role at

Washington and Lee.

 

A Clarification

The Ring-tum Phi wishes to acknowledge an error in that
it attributed the sentiments of Mr. Paul Herron to the Depart-
ment of Journalism and Communications in his recent article
in the Washington Post. We regret the implication of conden-
cension and prejudice on the part of the Department toward
the Ring-tum Phi stemming from this error of fact.

‘Waiting For Godot’ Entertaining
However Creaky Barn Inadequate

By MIKE NATION

Those who missed the Trouba-
dours’ presentation of “Waiting for
Godot” this past week should feel the
poorer for having not seen it. It was
a thoroughly competent rendition of
an entertaining, artistically and in-
tellectually im-
portant modern
play. “Godot” is
considered one of
the outstanding
works of the Ab-
surdist theatre.

The Trouba-
dours aid heavily
in cultural educa-
tion at W&L by
attempting to pre-
sent as many dif-
ferent forms of
drama of a cultural and intellec-
tual interest as possible. The liberal
arts college aims for the well-
rounded individual academically and
culturally. Washington and Lee does
fairly well in overcoming its small-
ness and relative isolation to pro-
vide for eultural opportunity through
sich activities as the theatre

Where W&L falls down is in the
failure te provide an adequate faci-
lity for the theatre group which
is, by the way, the largest single
extra-curricular activity on campus.
One ean hardly deem as adequate
a drafty, creaky barn in excess of a
century old which, as legend has it,
was originally a hospital and a pool
hall

One feels that Dr. Pemberton was
referring to Zorba being in love
with life itself. Material gain was not
all-important to him. It was the dec-
oration not the cake and icing. If
the decoration wasn’t there, “What

and as deliciously edible as ever.

Zorba's most striking characteris-
tie, partly it is the most praiseworthy

Students Have Conservative Outlook

 

By FRED MINDEL
Student Body President

Unquestionably the two most pre-
dominent trends in student activity
on the national
level would con-
sist of the Berkley
|| Free Speech
_ movement and the
political demon-
strations, particu-
larly the = anti-
Vietnam protests,
which have sprung
up all over the
| country. If one

. looks past the spe-
ee cific ends of each
of these, he will observe that they
are both the same type of activity;
they both involved students who are
rejecting external values imposed
upon them from without, whether
these come from a university ad-
ministration or the Johnson Admin-
istration. In both instances one finds
students expressing their opinions,
their will if possible which are de-
rived from personal rather than ex-
ternal and arbitrary values.

If one looks closely at W&L stu-
dents he can find here too the same
type of activity, although its speci-
fic form is on a level somewhat re-
moved from these national move-
ments. W&L students are also, to

   

 

some degree, reflecting external val-
ues imposed from without in favor
of values which they determine in-
dividually, They are not engaging in
picket lines or teach-ins or riots, for
there is a somewhat different means
geared to somewhat different ends.
Three main types of external values
have been or are in the process of
being reflected by an ever-increasing
portion of our student body. Certain
traditional values, such as some of
the more arbitrary aspects of Con-
ventional Dress, are being challeng-
ed. Students do not mind wearing
a coat and tie. What they are be-
ginning to mind is being told they
must do this. Certain administrative
values, such as the archaic cut sys-
tem which was recently replaced by
a more liberal one, had begun to
be challenged. Students felt that they
were quite capable of determining
for themselves when they should at-
tend classes and rejected having this
dictated to them by means of a limit-
ed system.

Even certain student-group values
such as the recently overthrown po-
litical party system which was based
solely on straight fraternity voting,
antagonized individual students to
the point where they openly re-
jected it. Students refused to have a
few individuals in their fraternity
dictate to them who they must vote

 

for. The main point with these few
examples of W&L student activities
is that, although they are on a dif-
ferent level than much of the na-
tional student activity, they are
nevertheless of the same general
type—for they too consist of the at-
tempt to replace external arbitrary
values with internal, individually -
imposed ones.

Two obvious questions seem to
emerge. The first, Why are the spe-
cific forms that W&L activity takes
different from these national move-
ments? and the second, What, if
anything, does this mean? Is there
any validity?

One occasionally hears, to the ef-
fect that “other campuses are con-
cerned with truly meaningful and
significant issues while W&L is
caught up and smothered by its own
pettiness and short-sightedness?”

Before attempting to answer the
question of why there exists a dif-
ference one must first determine
what really is the difference. For
purposes of simplicity, I shall iso-
late the anti-Vietnam protests which
take place on a national level and
try to compare it with corresponding
activity, political or other wise,
which is found on our campus. To
begin with, W&L cannot legitimately
be attacked for being concerned,
even primarily, with local issues that

 

By NICK RUFFIN

The traditional idea of the Wash-
ington and Lee gentleman has been
replaced by the image I described
last week. To demonstrate what has
been lost, I offer the following de-
scription from James Baldwin’s No-
body Knows My Name.

I suppose it can be said that
there was a time in this country
when an entity existed which
could be called a majority, let us
say a class, for lack of a better
word which created the standards
to which the country aspired. I
am referring (to) or have in mind,
perhaps somewhat arbitraritly, the
aristocracies of Virginia and New
England. These were mainly of
Anglo-Saxon stock, and they cre-
ated what Henry James was to
refer to, not very much later, as
our Anglo-Saxon Heritage or
Anglo-American connections, Now
at no time did these men ever form
anything resembling a popular
majority, Their was
that they kept alive and they bore
witness to two elements of a man’s
life which are not greatly respect -
ed among us now: (1) social forms,
called manners, which prevents
us from rubbing too abrasively
against one another and (2) the
interior life, or the life of the mind.
These things are important; these
things were realities for them and
no matter how rough-hewn or dark
the country was then, it is import-
ant to remember that this was also
the time when people sat up in
log cabins studying very hard by
lamplight or candlelight.

Mr. Baldwin may have attributed
more influence to the class of gentle-

nation as a whole. But the high im-
pact of the concept of the traditional
gentleman on the elite student body
of Washington and Lee is very prob-

 

able.

men than they actually had on the| 7

 

The balance of values in the tra-
ditional gentleman has ben dis-
torted in his modern derivative.
If the original idea of the gentle-
man were still held at W&L, it
would be complementary to, rather
than in conflict with education
here.

At this point let us examine the
decline of certain Washington and
Lee traditions as demonstrative of
the preversion of the gentleman con-
cept. A true gentleman would re-
ceive all men as being worthy of
his consideration and greeting. He
would feel himself to be in com-
munity with his fellow man. As a
W&L student he was to accept all
other students as sharing with him
the opportunities and responsibilities
of the educational experience at the
university. He would warmly and
sincerely greet one and all.

But today the Speaking Tradition
has become a means of status dem-
onstration. The student body has
been divided on lines of prestige
or coolness. Those who consider

 

Ruffin Attacks W GL Image of Gentleman;

themselves to be of high status will
not speak to anyone they consider
beneath them. Studs won’t speak to
fish. The more of a stud the student
thinks he is the more fish he sees
beneath him. Those who are con-
scious of this status game always see
more fish than studs, for if a stu-
dent sees more equals than inferiors
he would no be in an exclusive mi-
nority. For example, upperclassmen
do not speak to freshmen after rush
week.

The effect of the status game is
that those that speak to those
above in the status receive no re-
sponse. As a result there are more
unanswered hello’s than there are
answered ones. In a short time a
student stops greeting others if
he receives no response.

The true gentleman’s approach to
dress would be to dress in such a
way as to be appropriate for the oc-
casion. This means that one would
dress so as not to be disrespectful
of others. If style or custom change

South Vietnam Malady Lingers

By JAMES CHANCE

The French departure from Indo-
China following their calamitous de-
feat at Dienbienphu precipitated a
major confrontation between East
and West, with ultimate domination
of all of South-east Asia at stake
Under the dynamic and popular
leadership of Ho Chi Minh, the new-
ly created state of North Vietman
gravitated into the communist camp,
while South Vietnam under Presi-
dent Diem aligned itself with the
West, particularly the United States,
whose commitment to the perpetua-
tion of an effective anti-communist
government in South Vietnam be-
eame irrevocable with the estab-
lishment of the South East Asia
Treaty Organization

From the very conclusion of the
French-Indo-China War, it became
the avowed aim of the North Viet-
namese government to reunify Viet-
nam under communist domination.
The guerrilla war which had been
so effective against the French was
never suspended; its alm was simp-
ly shifted to the ultimate conquest
of South Vietnam. It was inevitable,

however, that the war should pro-

liferate and escalate to the point
where neither side could isolate it.
U.S, and Status Quo

The United States presumes to
have a considerable interest in the
maintenance of the status-quo in
South-east Asia, At the behest of
successive governments in Caigon,
the American commitment has grown
to the point where more than 150,-
000 Americans are presently en-
gaged, Our commitment is based on
several premises. The first of these
is the fact that now that we have
committed ourselves, it would con-
situte an irreparable loss of face
should we now decide to abrogate
our treaty obligations to that nation,
To Asians, this is an important con-
sideration, and perhaps we should
not regard it too lightly.

Secondly, there are those who
still subseribe to the policy of
“containment.” The advocates of this
policy refer to the successful imple-
mentation of a similar policy in
Europe after 1045. These theorists
suggest that a similar policy can be
adapted to meet our present needs
in Asia. Lastly, there are those who

 

dangle before the American public

 

the disquieting consequences of
withdrawal. They believe that
should South Vietnam fall, all of
South-east Asia would fall like
“dominoes,” eventually endangering
democratic India and even Australia.

Realistic Look

These are the reasons which advo-
cates of the war in Vietnam raise to
support their position. But let us
look more closely at them, These
proponents of the war suggest that
the “loss of American face” caused
by the evacuation of American
troops would be disasterous. It would
tend, they argue, to undermine the
confidence of other friendly Asian
governments in our resolve to main-
tain their independence in the face
of communist aggression. But be-
cause this policy has been effective
in the past, must we become im-
prudent slaves of the past and com-
mit ourselves more deeply in a war
which can never be won and which
will continue to take a rising toll
of American and Vietnamese lives’

Policy of Containment

Our policy of “containment” was
uecessful in Europe bhecaus

pelled to have turkey with the folks
at home, but they are quietly sav-
ing their pennies so that next year
they can go to New York for
Thanksgiving just like those world-
ly Juniors do.

The Senior, of course, will be hav-
ing a quiet dinner with the wife and
kiddies at Hillside Terrace.

But all of these fine young men
have so much to be thankful for, be-
cause they are fortunate enough to
attend the college of colleges, the
top of the educational heap, Wash-
ington and Lee University.

Let us then think for a moment,
friends, all of that we at Washington
and Lee have to be thankful for.

First of all, we are thankful for
our rational and temperate profes-
sors, those men who have dedicated
their lives and fortunes to academic
freedom, to guiding us along the
path of truth, to setting for us an ex-
ample of unimpassioned inquiry.

For this we thank Lee, O Lord.

For freedom of speech, for oppor-
tunity to express dissenting opinions,
for freedom of the press.

For this we thank Lee, O Lord.

For coats and ties, for discovering
the truth that “As a man looketh, so
is he.”

For this we thank Lee, O Lord.

We are grateful for the many De-
partments at Washington and Lee
that teach us trades, for those that
protect us from an impractical edu-
cauion

For this we thank Lee. O Lord.

Thankful are we for warm rela-
tions with faculty members, those
men who rise above ‘student vs. fac-
ulty’ to act as individual men at
whatever coat.

For this we thank Lee, O Lord.

We are thankful for the many pro-
feasors who provide such outstand-

Mindel Views W&L’s “Non-activism”

directly involve and relate to the
entire student body. On the contrary,
our very size seems to make it all
the more imperative that we place a
high premium on internal matters,
for we are so directly influenced by
them. The only valid criticism that
may be lodged is that we are so con-
cerned with our own society that we
have lost objectivity, that we have
become short-sighted to the point of
obscuring and losing sight of other
issues more meaningful and far-
reaching than those of our own aca-
demic community. Is this the case
with the Vietnam issue?

W&L differs most obviously from
other campuses, especially some of
the larger ones, because of the fact
that we are not involved in any
campus-wide movements such as
rallies, teach-ins or pickets. There
appear to exist three basic reasons
for this situation. Number one, W&L
is somewhat isolated, both geographi-
cally and also ideologically with re-
spect to the mainstream of national
attitudes. We are one step removed
from most of the people and events
that dominate daily news. We are not
jolted with each minor fluctuation
of the barometer of daily events—
and thus it would be foolish to ex-
pect that we respond in the exact
same fashion as other schools which
are more directly involved. Number
two, we are a small school which is
characterized by close personal re-
lations; each student in some way
feels that he is a part of Washing-
ton and Lee and as such does not
require anything external to exper-
ience a sense of belonging.

Students here do not need a
“cause” to express or defend them-
selves; this is done each day through
one’s personal relations with friends
and professors. Number three, the
general outlook of W&L is unques-
tionably conservative. Student values
are still one of the most powerful
influencing forces, and the prevalent
attitude is anti-movement, anti-pro-
test, even anti-enthusiasm. Any im-
petus towards demonstrations or
other enthusiastic expressions are
usually stifled by a permeating at-
titude of indifference to this type of
activity. Rabble rousers and dema-
gogues are ostracized.

But what does all this means? I
said there was a general indifference
to mass mevements and the like—
but I did not say there was a general
indifference to the issues themselves.
This is a point which must be over-
looked. There does indeed seem to
be a general concern, even a gener-
al familiarity, with the same issues
which predominate in other student
groups. A recent poll on the Vietnam
crisis reflected this same thought.

* B. S.
% By TOM CARPENTER

Fall sports have now officially
ended, and all the Washington and
Lee teams had succesful seasons ex-
cept the varsity football team. The
gridders dropped their sixth game
Saturday as opposed to only three
wins. You can bet that Coach Lee
McLaughlin is glad that this dismal
season is over at last. Game after
game McLaughlin watched more of
his players get racked up to the
extent that they were of little or no
use to the team from then on. Satur-
day was no exception. I ran into
four of the players Sunday, and to
look at them one would think that
they had been in an automobile ac-
cident. Billy Andrews looked like
someone ran over his face with a
pair of cleats, Jamie Andrew had
his arm in a sling, Tow Day walked
like Gimpy, Jim Large was in a
neck brace, and Andy Bloom had a
broken hand. It would be question-
able that McLaughlin could field 11
healthy players for another game.

Speaking of Bloom, I must say that
I am sorry that I will not be around
to watch him develop into another
“Johnny Unitas.” Against Washing-
ton University Saturday Bloom did
an amazing thing despite two handi-
caps. Andy threw 31 passes and
completed 18 for more than 230
yards. He did this despite not hav-
ing the availability of his pet target
Rob Reading and despite the fact
that he broke his right hand in the
first quarter of the game. He has
two more years at W&L and should
by the time he graduates have set
some kind of passing record here. He

may become the “man with the
golden arm.”
Anthony Sets Record
John Anthony seems to have

broken the school record for most
yards rushing in a single season.
John added 122 against Washington
to run his total for the year to 915
yards in 197 carries. This is more
than 200 yards better than Walt
Michael’s total the year the All-
American fullback led the Generals
to the Gator Bowl. Although the
record are incomplete, it seems very
unlikely that anyone has ever done
any better than Anthony.

Actually the biggest news in sports
on this campus deals with touch
football. In the tough intramural
league the championship ended with
the Phi Delts on top, although they
were not particularly happy about
it. The story goes like this. The
Kappa Sigs won the title game on
first downs after the score ended,
7-7. But the game was replayed

when the Phi Delts protested and |
won on the grounds that a crucial
penalty against the Kappa Sigs had
been improperly marked off, costing
the Phi Delts 15 yards that were
rightfully theirs. The Phi Delts won
the replay on first downs after a
0-0 seore. Neither team was satis-
fied with these results. The Phi
Delts won a tainted trophy, while
the Kappa Sigs believe that the
trophy should have been theirs. In
any event, no one believes that the
title game should be decided by first
downs. Let’s solve this problem by
playing a sudden death overtime un-
til a champion decided. First
downs are made by luck in so many
cases anyway. With first down and
one yard to go a first down is al-
most a certain thing. It seems ludi-
crous to decide a championship on
first downs.

Burns Gets the Ax

Anson Mount’s “Coach of the
Year” did not even make it through
the year as head coach of Iowa. He
was fired last Tuesday, but he did
coach the Hawkeyes to their ninth
defeat in ten games. Mount picked
Burns as the nation’s top collegiate
football coach and Iowa as a team
that would win nine of its ten games.
The Hawkeyes didn’t even get one
victory in Big Ten play.

going to initiate a new policy on

Chance Questions Policies

were able to install viable govern-
ments dedicated to the establishment
of democratic institutions. These
governments were able to maintain
the independence of their respective
nations because they enjoyed the
support of the majority of their peo-
ple. Is this the situation in South
Vietnam? Have the successive gov-
ernments there even demonstrated a
capacity to achieve stability? Have
not these governments in fact been
“models” of tyranny, repression and
stagnation?

And there are those who suggest
that should South Vetnam fall, all
Asia would quickly follow. I simply
ask: “How do they intend to bring
the War in South Vietnam to a suc-
cessful conclusion? How do they
propose to stop infiltration of com-
munist troops or communist domi-
nated nations for more than six hun-

dred miles? In short, the loss of
South Vietnam does not offer the
Communists a single stragetic ad-

vantage to the eventual domination
of all of South-east Asia.

So the malady will linger on; more
Americans will be killed, and South
Vietnam will continue to be indis-
criminately and callously ravaged.

Conservatism Or A pathy?
(Continued from page 2)

The point seems to be that W&L stu-
dents are concerned and caught up
in these more significant and mean-
ingful issues; only it is manifested
in forms other than campus-wide
movements. There are still the dis-
cussions, the debates and the articles;
it is just that these rarely get fur-
ther than the personal or semi-per-
sonal level.

The most important thing seems to
be the manner in which any individ-
ual is committed to a certain view-
point, and the process through which
this is arrived, rather than merely
the form of this commitment, The
fact that one student actively demon-
strates does not automatically make
his commitment more honest, more
real, or more valid from that of an-
other, who refrains from mass move-
ments, although this can occasional-
ly be the case.

There are two ways of viewing
W&L’s “non-activism” and _ both
come down to the nature of the indi-
viduals commitment. If a W&L man’s
commitment is arrived at honestly,
with a realistic acknowledgement of
all the factors and viewpoints invol-
ved, and is the result of serious and
challenging thought, then I contend
that it is as significant and mean-
ingful as that of any active demon-
strator. Yet on the other hand, if our
isolation has prevented, or even ob-
secured a realistic confrontation and
appraisal of the issues, then perhaps
we are to be criticized, and perhaps
a few demonstrations would be in
order.

then appropriate dress may change.
Notice that there are no_ specific
rules or regulations established other
than that dress be appropriate.

At Washington and Lee, Conven-
tional Dress became another ele-
ment in the status game. Dress be-
came a devotion of the label watch-
ers. The artificial hierarchy of a
Brooks shirt over a Gant made dress
more than the concern of the indi-
vidual. Those who were disenchant-
ed withdrew from the style contest.

The distortion of the gentleman
concept at Washington and Lee has
emphasized the surface demonstra-
tion of value at the cost of the
deeper human value. The tendency
is to reject a thing if you cannot
buy it, wear it, drink it, drive it
or go to bed with it.

For those who protect us against

For this we thank Lee, O Lord.

We are thankful for the wonderful,

For this we thank Lee, O Lord.

For the high sense of honor set

For this we thank Lee, O Lord.

But most of all, we are thankful

Preliminary Self-Study Report To Be Made Public

 

 

E C Considers M embership
In Nat. Student Association

The EC has taken under consider-
ation a proposal made by President
Fred Mindel that W&L become a
member school of the United States
National Student Association.

The NSA, founded in 1947, is a
confederation of 310 university stu-
dent governments to help deal with
problems arising from increasing
college enrollments, educational
standards, academic freedom, inter-
national student understanding and
cooperation, and community service.

In addition to being the largest
national college student organization
in America, the NSA is also the only
college group which is a voting
member of the American Council on
Education.

Each summer delegates from each
school meet in a National Student
Congress. Through seminars, com-
mittees, and legislative plenary ses-
sions, an attempt is made to propose
policies of value to American stu-
dents, largely concerning campus
problems, but also including state-
ments on international issues.

Religious Work
To Be Shown

The only colored slides in ex-
istence of a rare 13th century mas-
terpiece will be shown here Monday.

Dr. John Esten Keller, professor of
Spanish at the University of North
Carolina, will show the slides and
lecture on them at 8:15 p.m. in
duPont Auditorium.

Dr. Keller is the only man ever
given permission to make photo-
graphic copies of the rare book,
“Canticles of Our Lady,” a collee-
tion of poetic hymns illustrated with
full-page colored miniatures. The

 

book composed during the reign of

 

‘Sdier s

Spanish King Alfonso X in the 13th
eentury and new in a Spanish mu-
seum, gives a unique composite view
of medieval life

Students ol regard the beau-
tiful illustrations as valuable works
of art for the period; musicologists
see the songs as a significant musi-
development; and students of

cerning the problems experienced on
various campuses and the manner in
which these problems were met.

Full-Program Consultants coordi-
nate regional and campus programs
for member schools.

International Student ID Card,
which allows American students in
28 countries to obtain special dis-
counts, can be obtained by students
at member schools at a lower price
than is ordinarily possible.

Publications are available concern-
ing student community involvement,
student rights and fredoms, higher
education in general, and other stu-
dent government affairs.

Conferences are held on a region-
al level, in addition to the annual
Congress. There are further confer-
ences for editors, students body pres-
idents, and NSA coordinators.

Cost to member schools is $15 per
year.

The NSA has been praised by
numerous national leaders, includ-
ing Presidents Johnson, Kennedy,
and Eisenhower; Vice-presidents
Nixon and Humphrey; and others.

Mindel emphasizes the advantages
which W&L could obtain from mem-
bership in the NSA, “especially the
valuable support it would give to
the student government in research”;
for example, in studying the exper-
iences of other universities changing
from a six- to five-day schedule.

He added that membership would
provide W&L with an opportunity
to have a voice in the formation of
the policies of an organization to
which a great number of American
universities belong.

No action was taken on voting to
join the association, pending further
investigation by BC members.

Editor Canham Discusses
6 World-Changing Ideas

One of America’s most distin-
guished speaker, Erwin D. Canham,
delivered a talk on “Who Is Win-
ning the World-Wide Struggle for
the Minds of Men?” to a large and
receptive audience Tuesday evening
in Reid Hall.

Mr. Canham is the editor of the
Christian Science Monitor, which
ranks among this country’s most re-
spected newspapers; he is past pres-
ident of the American Association
of Newspaper Editors and of the
Chambers of Commerce of the
United States, and is an alternate
delegate to the General Assembly
in the United Nations.

In his remarks, Canham com-
mented that he does not believe
that any one nation or ideology
should dominate the minds of men,
and that none does. Instead, ideas
are ‘winning’ the struggle. He set
forth six of the most significant
of these ideas and spoke of their
relationship to the inevitable changes
going on in the world today.

First in contemporary importance,
he said, is the concept of National-
ism. This desire for nationhood, na-
tional self-government, overrides
any single struggle of political theor-
ies. Nationalism is presently trium-

| phant in Asia, Africa, the Americas,

Professor Sponsors Petition
Supporting Action In Vietnam

Prompted by a call from 100 prom-
inent Americans for positive message
of support for the Government's
policy in Vitnam, political science
professor Martin Merson has pre-
sented to the faculty and students a
petition for them to sign “as individ-
uals, not as representative of Wash-
ington and Lee,” according to Mer-
son.

Alter the giant demonstration in
front of the White House last Sun-
day, such public figures as Dean
Rusk and Thurston Morton said that
the people of America should ex-
press their support for the govern-

ment, not a Democratic administra-
tion, by signing the petition which
they presented. Professor Merson

copied this draft verbatim. It reads

“We the undersigned, students of
Washington and Lee, do hereby de-
elare that:

We as Americans renew our dedi-
eation to the achievement of peace
with freedom. To this end, we de-
our support of the American
Vietnam, and
whatever national
required shall be
voted to its fulfillment.”

and in Europe (especially in France),
but it does not solve all problems;
nationalism need not be the end of
political organization.

Rebellion is the second important
idea, and is likewise triumphant to-
day. The revolution of the colonies
against England has been imitated
ever since—even Rhodesia, Mr. Can-
ham observed, today quotes princi-
ples first set forth in Virginia.

Third is the idea of Federalism,
atempts at which are being made
(not successfully as of now) in Eu-
rope. In this country, federalism is
seen in the union of the States; in
other nations, regional agreements,
especially such as the Common Mar-
ket, are evidence of the significance
of Federalism.

“Perfectability” in its seventeenth-
century New England meaning is
another great concept—the idea that
man’s lot can be dramatically im-
proved through technological ad-
vances. Science transcends ideology,
Canham stated: “There are no labels
on knowledge.”

Also consequential is the accept-
ance of those ideas of communica-
tion which are particularly suited
to our way of life. Transitor radios,
for example, are teaching African
natives who have never had con-
tact with civilization. Along this
line, Canham remarked that he dis-
agrees with Marshall McLuhan’s
contention that the printed word is
today losing its significance, that “the
word is here to stay.”

A sixth important idea today is
that of American culture and its ef-
fects as it encompasses the world.
This culture is itself composed of
many strange combinations of ideas
from many strange sources, but it
has had a remarkable effect on other
societies. Mr. Canham recalled that
in Moscow's Lenin Day parade of
a few years ago, a small combo of
Russians was heard playing “When
the Saints Go Marching In.”

The United States it net ‘winning’
the struggle for the minds of men
but neither is Russia, nor China, nor

deGaulle. “No one dominates the
world in which we live and into
which we are moving. Nothing is

guaranteed except the certainty of
change. We must be everlastingly re-
sponsive to such change.”

Dr. John H. Wise, analyst for the
self-study program of the College
of Arts and Sciences, has announced
that the preliminary report of the
Self-Study Committee on the Col-
lege will be presented to the faculty
and students early next week.

Dr. Wise will hold open discus-
sions on the forthcoming summary of
compiled self-study material with
faculty members in Newcomb 8,
Tuesday, December 7. at 7:30 p.m.
He will meet with interested stu-
dents on Wednesday, December 8,
also in Newcomb 8, at 2:30 and at
7:30 p.m.

General areas of consideration
include objectives of the College, its
students, curriculum. special pro-
grams, and research possibilities. The
report is expected to pose questions
and suggest a number of recom-
mendations, under study at the pres-
ent time.

Specific topics within the objec-
tives portion of the program of the
College encompass admission poli-
cy, orientation procedure, increase
in independent work, and the en-
couragement of fuller integration of
the social and academic spheres. In
regard to students a variety of ques-
tions about the Automatic Rule and
penalties, departmental fluctuations,
enrollment in various departments,
and attrition rates make up a part
of what is being examined. Profes-
sor Wise will discuss degree pro-
grams and the question of accuracy
and merit of the current grading
system. In addition, other aspects
of the curriculum such as course
offerings, the Honors program, and
comprehensive examinations for ex-
ample will receive attention. The re-

 

Troubadour Auditions
For Second Production
Set For Next Tuesday

Auditions will be held next Tues-
day, Dec. 7, for the Troubadours’
second production of the 1965-66
season, Shapkespeare’s Richard HI.

Like the readings for Waiting for
Godot, auditions for the show will
be in two parts, one from 4 to 5
p.m. and the second from 7 to 9.
Mr. Lee Kahn, director of the
Troubadours, urged all interested to
attend both sessions if possible “so
that I can get as good an idea as
possible of what you can do.”

There are 25 male roles to be cast
in Richard H. Kahn emphasized that
as the play will not be presented
until Mareh 2-5, it will not be nec-
essary to begin rehearsals until
alter exams.

Scripts for the play are now avail-
able in Mr. Kahn's office at the
theater. Anyone interested in trying
for a part is invited to check out
a copy to study.

port shall also deal with the ques-
tion of greater cooperation with
VMI, and some of the other special
programs conducted under the au-
spices of the University. Research
opportunities and the concomitant
sources of support constitute yet
another area of consideration. More
specifically, the self-study report ex-
amines faculty leaves of absence and
travel for the purpose of continued
study, the Robert E. Lee Research
Program now available to students,
and student success in obtaining
prestigious fellowships. Lastly, the
report will undertake the Universi-
ty’s role in the realm of community
service, namely “town-gown” rela-
tions and cooperation with area sec-
ondary schools.

The summary of material consider-
ed which will be released next week
is by no means the final, definite
statement of the Self-Study Com-
mittee. In many cases, the subject
matter discussed shall be assigned to
subcommittees for further study.

Professor Wise has announced that
if, to cover fully the subject matter,
more meetings than those already
scheduled become necessary, such
meetings shall be arranged.

 

 

Debaters Face
Tough Contest
At Georgetown

The Washington and Lee debate
team gained further acclaim over
the Thanksgiving holidays, this time
at the Georgetown Invitational Tour-
nament. Each of the two squads
which participated compiled 6 and
2 records at this, by far the most
competitive meet of the semester. It
was the best record ever recorded
by W&L at this well-known con-
test.

George Dover and Chris Mills on
one squad, and Tom Baremore and
Hal Higginbotham on the other faced
some of the toughest competition
from among the 138 teams from 100
universities in the U.S. and Canada
that participated. In addition to the
East Coast powers, units from U.S.C.
U.L.C.A., Nevada, the U. of Chicago,
and the University of Houston
traveled to Washington to compete
for the honors ultimately won by
Dartmouth College.

This weekend two more units from
Washington and Lee are competing
at another meet. Director of For-
ensics William W. Chaffin took four
freshmen to the N.Y.U. (Uptown)
Hall of Fame Tournament in New
York City. Harry Zeliff and Paul
Prince on the affirmative and Kirk
Woodward and Bill Christie on the

 

negative will face competition from
_ forty schools across the US.

Housemanagers’ Committee

Last Spring, the Housemanagers’ Association announced its
disbandment because the group’s major task had become send-
ing out post cards announcing the meetings. Originally organ-
ized to attack an ambitions program of cooperative food buy-
ing, the Association had degenerated to a collective center for
checks all fraternities had to pay for services such as Orkin,
summer lawn trimmings, and fix extinguisher refills.

These functions, not earth-shattering in scope, had to be
performed by someone. The IFC seemed the logical choice
and the body accepted the defunct association. At that time
many people on the IFC felt the new appendage would be a
stagnant committee whose chairman would be saddled with
the responsibility of collecting checks.

Roger Milam, the committee’s chairman, has changed that
preconception. The committee is now in the process of collect-
ing information about fraternity insurance coverage for houses,
housemothers and other employees. The result of this study
may be better coverage for all these groups as lower premiums
for each fraternity. And this is the first in a long line of projects

now on the drawing boards.

Milam and his committee are to be congratulated on the
foresight and energy which have revived the House Managers’

Committee.

 

The Washington March

 

Vietniks in the Afternoon!

By STEVE MILLARD

At first glance, it was not unlike
a thousand other Saturday mornings
in the nation’s capital.

Mothers dragged their reluctant
offspring across Memorial Bridge in
search of the perfect shoe sale. Teen-
agers filed out of the record shops
and headed for nearby lunch count-
ers, where traffic in hot turkey sand-
wiches was less than brisk on this
particular weekend. The unfortunate
few who owed an extra day to the
government had only the relative
absence of rush hour to console
them. A town crier surveying the
scene would have been quick to
proclaim that “all is well,” to which
Washingtonians would have readily
assented.

In the heart of all this good cheer
a crowd was gathered, armed with
signs and intense expressions and
determination to convince their con-
tented neighbors that all was in fact
far from well. On Pennsylvania
Avenue the cluster of people gradu-
ally became a long line, moving by
a tortuous path toward its destina-
tion at the Washington Monument.
As the first regiment moved out, re-
inforcements arrived to grab their
banners and join the ranks of the
saving remnant.

Thus began the March on Wash-
ington for Peace in Vietnam—gran-
daddy of all the endless outbursts
designed to “awaken the American
conscience to his needless slaught-
er.” At the day's end, when the
marchers finished their task and
turned in their signs, there was lit-
tle evidence that their efforts—which
one leader described as a “huge suc-
cess”——had proeduced anything be-
yond 50,000 weary legs and one
rather harried police force.

Still, it seemed that only outsiders
shared this view. The vast majority
of the non-violent warriors ex-
uded a supreme faith in the merit
and potential influence of their cru-
sade.

Standing across the street from the
White House, I watched a well-oiled
machine begin to function. Parading
by was a motley assemblage of
bearded students, distraught house-
wives, and reformed veterans. At
this point, my curiosity got the bet-
ter of me; I stepped into the group
and shuffled off down the street.

My hopes of picking up bits and
pieces of conversation remained fu-

 

tile as long as the line kept moving.
It was a far cry from the civil rights
march of two summers ago, when
spontaneity and singing voices ruled
the day. Isolated efforts to inject
music into the proceedings died al-
most before they began. The march-
ers seemed to rely upon sheer num-
bers to impress the world with their
concern.

However, the picture changed as
the procession neared its assigned
goal. Across from the Monument, a
huge circle of marchers slowly took
shape. As new faces arrived, they
held fast to one spot until the march
became a stationary object com-
posed of 25,000 people.

Here, as people rested and un-
packed their lunches, a different
world emerged. Where they had
previously walked in the traffic of
a large city, the faithful were now
solely among friends.

I covered the circumference of the
group, wondering what might be
their personal reactions. One young
student was concerned because “the
mood of this march is just too mod-
erate. We should all be telling them
to get the hell out of Vietnam.” A
mother walked wearily up to a mar-
shal, wondering what was planned
for the remainder of the march.
“Speeches at 2:00,” she was informed
eurtly. The prospect obviously struck
her as distinetly unexciting.

Conversations inevitably turned
to other topics. Two middle-aged
marchers enthusiastically debated
the relative merits of their respec-
tive psychoanalysts. Another ex-
plained to a bystander his preference
for the health foods which occupied
his lunchbag. The diet apparently
hadn't accomplished much.

One marcher, obviously a prime
mover in some organization, col-
lared a northern student to discuss
“research teams.” “We organize
groups in every major city,” he ex-
plained, “to find out who our targets
are—who might help us carry the
ball.” As a postscript, he added,
“We're having a meeting tonight at
the Sheridan Hotel. Do drop by.” The
whole conversation suggested a
working knowledge of social science
tinged with a dash of Madison Av-
enue. Somebody knew his stuff
rather well

At the Monument, a few singers
broke their silence to offer a fragile

One of the best ideas to come out
of W&L in recent years, CONTACT,
moved another step toward success
today when ten noted authorities
on the problems of urban areas were
invited to speak at the second an-
nual weekend symposium, Febru-
ary 10, 11, and 12. The prospective
lecturers were selected for their
knowledge of this year’s topic under
discussion, “The City.”

Co-chairman Roger Sennott and
Phil Claxton released the names of
the experts who were asked to de-
liver speeches and conferences for
the three-day event:

Wolf Von Eckhart, the architecture
critic for the Washington Post.

Aline Saarinen, wife of the late
architect Eero Saarinen and com-
mentator for NBC.

 

Harvey Cox, theologian and au-
thor of Secular City,

Morton G. White, Professor of
Philosophy at Harvard, and author
of The Intellectual vs. the City.

Paul Goodman, author of Growing
Up, Absurd, and Communitas.

Michael Harrington, author of The
Other America, and The Accidental
Century.

Kenneth Clark, author of Dark
Ghetto, and a psychologist at the
City College of New York.

Claude Brown, author of Man-
child in the Promised Land.

William Stringfellow, a lawyer in
Harlem.

Kevin Lynch, a city planner from
Massachusetts Institute of Technol-
ogy.

The Honorable Robert Wagner,
Mayor of the City of New York.

 

Hartin Sees Liberals as Discontented

 

 

 

By LIN HARTIN
It is rather difficult to believe that
Lyndon Johnson has been president
for only two years.
The days of John
F. Kennedy seem
to be a memory
out of a distant
past and about as
closely connected
with the Johnson
administration as
is that of Millard
Fillmore.

The memory of
the late president
is, to be sure, very
much alive. Books about him have
been pouring forth this year. Monu-
ments have been going up all over
the world. The late President was
universally admired and respected.
His widow has become the symbol
of heroic courage. His brothers have
devoted followings if for no other
reason because of the magic of their
name.

More than this, most people have a
very personal memory of the late
president. For some he is intimately
connected with a certain period of
their own lives. Indeed, for those
three years there was a spirit, “that
special grace,” that seemed to af-
fect the whole nation.

Why is the situation so different
now? Lyndon Johnson is a very
different type of individual. This was
certainly to be expected. Perhaps
we don't like his “style” very much,
but we can't blame him for being
different. As much as we may miss
the atmosphere that surrounded the
White House in the days of President
Kennedy, we must now accept Lyn-
don Johnson's way of doing things as
the best we can and try not to com-
pare him with the late President too
often.

If this were the only area of dis-
content the problem would be notice-
able but really not so very serious.
Unfortunately this is not the case.
Politically a rather curious situation
has arisen. A segment of the presi-
dent's own support is rather unhap-
py and for somewhat elusive reasons.

Last November President Johnson
was elected by a very wide margin.
This election was a result of a rather
broad coalition that did not want

 

 

 

Johnson Coalition Breaking

to see Goldwater even get close to
becoming president. Liberal Demo-
crats were a fairly significant part
of that coalition and from this
group today come signs of at least
mild discontent.

The congress elected last year
was overwhelmingly Democratic.
During the first session this year, the
congress passed bill after bill that
the President had requested. Many
of these measures were left over
from the New Frontier. Others were
entirely creations of the Johnson
Administration. However, all of them
were measures that the liberals had
been urging for years.

Why then would this group be
discontented? Many of the liberals
don’t like the President’s foreign
policy particularly with respect to
Southeast Asia and Latin America.

(Continued on page 4)

Other possibilities as speakers,
should an insufficient number of men
respond, are Robert Weaver, Nation-
al director of the Federal Housing
Authority, Victor Gruen, an archi-
tect, and Edmund Logue, head of
Urban Renewal for the city of Bos-
ton.

“The city is the biggest question
facing the country today,’ Sennott
says. “Everyone will live in a city

Roger Sennott
“The City...The Biggest Question”

at one time or another. If the cities’
problems aren’t solved, the problems
of the nation won’t be solved.” It was
with this in mind that the chairmen
chose this year’s topic.

These speakers will discuss the
problems of the city in the United
States today “from every possible
point of view,” according to the
Co-chairmen.

In analyzing the subject, Sennott
finds several areas which deserve
intensive study. He wants CONTACT
to examine the aesthetic viewpoint

 

 

 

CONTACT Co-Chairmen Invite Experts
To Discuss “The City” at February Event

of the cities—the city as an envir-
onment—to determine whether city
planners and architects can improve
it. The economic problem in the cities
is acute, he feels. “The crisis of
urban poverty is one of the most
serious facing the cities now. The
middle-class whites are moving out,
to be replaced by lower class, poorer
workers,” said Sennott.

Another major area which will be
discussed intensively will be the race
question. “We will try to find out
just what barriers there are to Ne-
gvoes in achieving first class citizen-
ship in urban areas,” he added.

Sennott went on to point out that
both the intellectual and the prac-
tical viewpoint would be represent-
ed. “We have invited many men
whose primary field is theory, but
the mayors will be there to give an
appraisal from the position of one
who must work with these problems
every day,’ he commented.

The CONTACT weekend, explain-
ed Claxton, is designed to be “an
intellectual symposium, which will
attempt to bring well-qualified
speakers to the campus to stimulate
students.”

The February date was set, Clax-
ton noted, so that the students would
not be in the midst of a particularly
strenuous academic period. “It’s right
after final exams, so the class load
shouldn’t be too heavy,” he said.
“Maybe out of sheer interest and a
desire to learn something, students
will give up their dates for that
weekend, or bring her along to the
lectures and seminars.”

The format for this year’s meet-
ing will be roughly similar to last
year’s. There will be one speech
in the afternoon, and one in the
evening on each of the three days.
The speeches are to be followed by
panel discussions featuring the lec-
tures, professors from various de-
partments in the University and
students, and a short question-and-
answer session.

 

Eliminate the Petty Work.

Awad: True

By JIM AWAD
A few weeks ago, a Ring-tum
Phi columnist astutely examined the
myth of the Wash-

ington and Lee
Gentleman. The

columnist came to
the conclusion that
he no longer ex-
ists and that this
university, if it is
to keep pace with
the rest of the
country, must for-
mulate, establish,
and rally around a
new symbol.

The symbol | propose to serve as
our rallying point is not a tangible
one. It derives its potential neither
from man nor legend; it can’t be
found in the pages of history; and
its traces are in no way available to
the endeavors of scientific experi-
ment.

I propose that the students, fac-
ulty, administration, and Board of
Trustees of Washington and Lee
University look to that abstraction
upon which we place the name
“spirit” for future guidance.

Education Through ‘Spirit’

The dictionary refers to “spirit”
in many ways—vivacity, order, quick
resentment, courage, enthusiastic
loyalty, real meaning, the life prin-
ciple, etc. Each and every one of
these terms applies to the thesis
of this exposition adequately.

As a unified group, though, these
terms describe exactly what I refer
to when I make use of the word
“spirit.”

Obviously, the quest of “spirit”
must be a united one—including all
those in any way connected with
the university. | choose, though, to
approach it from the point of view
of the student, in hopes that the
faculty, administration, and trustees
will divine their respective roles
from what will be said here.

There seem to be two obvious araes
of study—academiec and social.

Whether we like it or not, we are
in Lexington to get an education.
This necessarily involves us in the
academic world, and it requires of
each and every one of us a tremen-
dous amount of work.

What I am proposing is that we
attack the problem and concept of
education with “spirit.” This invol-

ves courage, vivacity, quick resent-
ment, enthusiastic loyalty, and real
meaning.

Bringing it down to the level of
reality, which I am proposing is that
we lift ourselves above the level of
the day-to-day grind. Instead, let
us substitute the free expression of
ideas in a controversial and beneficial
manner. Of course, this would re-
quire a tremendous amount of effort
on the part of all students. But the
result would be a much more ration-
al relationship between students and
faculty.

No longer would the professor be
required to use “tactics” to make
sure the students are doing the work.
Gone would be the days of popquiz-
zes; gone would be the days of daily
assignments.

Instead, we would be working with
the professors toward a common
goal—true and interesting education.
No longer would education be based
solely on petty hour quizzes and
oral recitations in class. The amazing
thing is that education would be-
come a truly stimulating and note-
worthy experience. No longer would
incentive be killed by four years of
living from hour quiz to hour quiz.

A offspring would be
the atiraction to this university of
the best of all possible students who
really want to learn. On this basis,
the progress achieved above would
be self-perpetuating

Furthermore, this university would
rapidly come to be considered one
of the best in the Our de-
grees would valuable,
that we would be able to get bette:

The beauty of it ail is that thi

the point of view prescribed here,
we would, through cooperative ef-
fort, be able to eliminate the “petty
work” now running rampant on

But G Down W&L, 119-94,

But Coach Sees

Washington and Lee's varsity |
basketball team opened its season |
Wednesday night with a 119-94 loss |
to Bridgewater, but things don’t look
so band. This year’s edition is much
improved over last year’s assemblege
of basketball players, and several
opponents had better watch out.

Bridgewater broke on top and after
the first quarter led by less than
ten only once, but the final score
was not indicative of the game. Un-
til the last few minutes, with subs
playing for both teams, the Eagles
never led by more than 15.

The Eagles foreed an overload of
the W&L switching zone and scored
easily from the baselines, but when
the Generals could shut off these
shots, their defense look more than
adequate.

These good shots and free throws
tell the story. Bridgewater hit 45 out
of 85 shots for 52 per cent while the
Generals hit on 39 of 97 for 40 per
cent. At the line the Eagles hit 29
for 35, 83 per cent, while W&L fell
to 14 of 21, 67 per cent.

For the Generals captain Bob
Spessard helped to control the boards
with 12 rebounds, two more than
Sweitzer and Morrison. Surprisingly
enough W&L won this battle 59-41.

team in scoring with 21 points, fol-
lowed ‘by Steve Sweitzer with 20 and
Frank Morrison, in a substitute role,
with 16. Coach Verne Canfield has
set as goals for both Sweitzer and
Spessard double figures—in both
scoring and rebounding. And both
started on the right track as Spes-
sard followed Morrison with 13.

Worth comment is the fact that
these four hit on 47 per cent of their
shots while pulling in 40 rebounds.

Coach Canfield said that “the at-
titude of the six returning letter-
men is tops, especially that of the
two seniors, going for their best
years,” and this could mean trouble
for Old Dominion and North Caro-
lina Wesleyan, the Generals’ next
two foes.

Old Dominion, an away game to-
night, remembers our win over them
last year and will be trying to
avenge this defeat. All five starters
are back, but this team was sound-
ly defeated by American University
in its opener Wednesday. Unfor-
tunately for W&L this is not just,
any away game but Old Dominion’s
Homecoming. A win would be even
sweeter.

Ever wonder why your son wasn’t

and sundry means (don’t ever knock
public relations until you've tried it),
the pro teams (the one’s that admit

counts: (1) Ability to fill the most
gaping hole on the team, (2) Avail-
ability. This last qualification means

Roanoke Squad
In First Meet

The Washington and Lee swim
team opened its season Wednesday
with a burst of power in defeat-

ing Roanoke College 53-33. Although
the times were very good for this
early in the season, the level of
competition furnished by West Vir-
ginia, East Carolina, American Uni-
versity and Catholic University lat-
er will challenge the abilities of the
team.

Two new pool records were set
by the Generals as Nelson Head
turned in a 56.7 in the backstroke
split of the 400 yard medley relay
and freshman Billy Ball clocked a
2:04 in the 200 yard individual free-
style.

Other W&L winners were Thorsen
in the 200 freestyle, Gary Bokinsky
in the 50 free, Clinard in the one
meter diving, Clay in the 200 yard
fly, Taylor in the 100 free, Kimmel
in the 200 yard backstroke, Law-
rence in the 500 free, Costello in the
200 breaststroke, and W&L in the
400 free relay.

Grambling, Slippery Rock, L. A.
State— these are small colleges that
year in and year out manufacture
“Little-All-Americas.” But this
year Washington and Lee ha sturned
out three Honorable Mention “Little
All-Americas,” John Anthony, Jeff
Novinger, and Tersh Baker.

Washington and Lee was _ also
well represented in soccer, placing
three players on the All-State team
and three others on the second team.
Co-captains Tim Henry and David
Redmond were joined on the first
unit by David Kirkpatrick, while
Fred Skinner, Brad Shinkle, and
Bob Larus made the second unit.

John Anthony, a Delt senior, was
the workhorse of the General of-
fense, carrying the ball 197 times for
915 placing him in tie for twenty-
seventh in the nation among small
college backs.

Jeff Novinger, one of the Generals’
tri-captains, is a KA senior and one
of the best linebackers in the small
ocllege ranks. While functioning best
against a running attack Novinger
also intercepted two passes and
broke up many more aerial plays.

Tersh Baker, another Delt senior,
was the leading pass catcher for
W&L this year, snaring 30 passes for
381 yards and three touchdowns. In
addition Baker was an outstanding
blocker.

David Redmond gained several
more honors this year. In the past

he has made All-State, All-South, |

NCAA Eastern Regional, and Most
Valuable Defensive Player in Vir-
ginia. This year he again made All-
State, missing a unanimous selection

by only one vote, and and All-South, |

two years in a row—a first for W&L.
Redmond and Taylor of Lynchburg
each polled three of the six ballots
for the MVP, but Taylor was award-
ed the trophy, possibly because Red-
mond won it last year.

team, for while not losing a single
player by graduation, Wesleyan has
picked up two good players who be-
came eligible after we played them
last year. One of these was the MVP
in the Dixie Conference Tourney last
year.

The schedule is really rough this
year, with the first five games on
the road. On December 15 the Gen-

they go on the road again for the

these first eleven games in decent

they finally get home.

“Ain’t It Right To Want Freedom,”
or something of the sort.

On the streets of Washington,
workers and shoppers remained ob-
livious to the quasi-religious affair
on the hill above them. Sporadic
counter-protests throughout the day
had been greeted with indulgent
chuckles by the marchers, but this
massive indifference was far more
meaningful. In a country where such
protest is greeted with nothing
more than a casual glance, no march
can awaken a “national conscience”
which is unwilling to respond. All
day the dissenters had paraded the
streets of Washington, sublimely ob-
livious to their utter lack of effect.
If anything can equal their political
gullibility, it is their blindness to the
futility of protest marches as an in-
fluence upon the mind of America.

Liberals Said Unhappy
(Continued from page 2)

Here the liberals have a legitimate
gripe with the president. On domes-
tic issues, however, there seems to
be little reason for dissatisfaction.
Yet, there is talk of “homesick lib-
erals.” In congress the liberals rallied
once behind Edward Kennedy on
the poll tax amendment and then
were able to defeat the Dirksen
Amendment. On the whole, however,
they seem to be grumbling to them-
selves while they are sat upon by
the Johnson coalition.

What significance will this group
have in the future? Certainly they
won't try to deny the Democratic
nomination of Lyndon Johnson in
1968. This leaves 1972, but with this
a lot of other elements are involved.
For one thing, Lyndon Johnson
might control the party so complete-
ly by then that he could pick his
own successor. None the less, there
might very well be an effort to
nominate one of the Kennedy broth-
ers that year. If such an effort is
to be successful, the liberals must
start now and first by finding some

“Derby Day” To Be Fancy Dress Theme

Bk ALAN COOPER

Fancy Dress President Joe
ennouneed today the selection of
“Derby Day” as the theme for the
1966 Fancy Dress Ball. The annual
dance weekend is scheduled for Jan-
uary 29-30.

According to Miller,
from Nashville, Tennessee, the theme
was chosen specifically to “escape”
from the Civil War motif into which
every Fancy Dress theme tends to
degenerate. Another reason was to
give more variety to the decorations
and costumes.

What Miller described as a

selection”

Miller

a Delt senior

“wide
of costumes will be avail-
able before Christmas vacation,
which begins December 18. Exact
dates and times for costume fittings
have not yet been set, but will be
announced shortly.

Roy Taylor, Delt senior from Rich-

 

mond ,Virginia, has been appointed

Fancy Dress vice-president in charge

of costumes. A, complete list of
weekend vice-presidents will appear
in the Friday Ring-tum Phi.

Prices for costume rentals are ex-
pected to be down from last year,
with outfits starting at $6.25.

Sets and decorations for this year’s
ball, commented Miller, will be put
up and designed with professional
assistance. “We expect this to be a
substantial improvement over the
previous years,” said Miller, “and we
hope to set a lasting precedent.”
The Dance Board Advisory Coun-
cil, composed of two members from
each fraternity, will assist in the
constructions of sets and in the gen-
eral preparation for the Ball.

The annual cocktail party will be
held at the Moose Lodge on Route

Miller noted that straight bourbon
whiskey will be served, in keeping
with the Kentucky Derby theme.

Last Year’s Ball Crowded

Last year’s Fancy Dress Ball had
“Showboat” as a theme, and head-
lined the Glenn Miller Orchestra, Joe
and Eddie, and The Lettermen. At-
tendance at the Ball last year was,
according to the Dance Board, heav-
iest in several years. Over 200
couples crowded Evans Dining Hall
last year for the South’s last major

Change In ‘Automatic Rule Governor Smylie To Speak
Voted At Faculty Meeting On Dec. 14 In Lee Chapel

Academic Probation Substituted
For Automatic Rule Penalty

Dean W. W. Pusey announced today sweeping changes

in the University’s automatic

rule approved by the faculty

yesterday, and effective January 1966. The new policy pro-
vides for academic probation instead of withdrawal from the
University for those students who fall under the automatic rule

January of each session.

Dean Pusey pointed out that the
new policy does not eliminate min-
imum grade-point ratios, but rath-
er that it insures students a “sec-
ond chance” in almost every case
Failure to make minimum progress
will result in academic probation or
action under the automatic rule

Probation

A student is placed on academic
probation for the following semester
if he fails earn a grade-point
ratio of at least equal to the follow-
ing:

1. During the first semester of his
freshman year a grade-point ratio
on all work attempted of 375.

2. During the second semester of
his freshman grade-point
ratio of all wark attempted of 4.

During each semester of his soph-
omore year a grade-point ratio on
all work attempted of 5

4. During each subsequent semes-
ter a grade-point ration on all work
attempted of .7

If a student is placed on academic
probation both he and his parents
will be warned of his precarious po-
sition, and he may required to
withdraw from the University at
any time that his academic work is
unsatisfactory. A student on academ-
ic probation is still not permitted to
own, control, or operate a motor ve-
hicle within Rockbridge County, or
to participate in certain athletic or
extra-curricular activities. Fresh-
and sophomores on academic
probation are eligible to participate
in intramural athletics

NSA and W&L?

This evening the Executive Committee of the student body
will take under consideration a proposal to affiliate with the
United States National Student Association. The eighteen year
old confederation of university student governments is some-
what controversial particularly in the South because of its in-
volvement in national politics. The Association in the last few
years adopted a number of resolutions dealing with American
domestic and foreign policy which are representative of the

liberal point of view.

Unfortunately, the publicity which has surrounded the pub-
lication of these resolutions seems to indicate that the organ-
ization is speaking for all its member schools. This is, of course,
not true, and if the press had bothered to investigate they
would have discovered that there is significant dissent within
the organization over these issues.

All too many students who are opposed to joining this

group fail to realize that the

Association provides a forum

through which member schools can and do express minority
opinions. It is rather ridiculous to boycott the Association
simply because at this time it does not represent the views of
our school. Obviously, we cannot hope to change its position
by ignoring its existence or refusing to participate. We can
withdraw from the group later if it proves to be worthless.

On the other hand it is apparent that we do not at this
time know a sufficient amount about the operation of the As-
sociation or its possible value to Washington and Lee. Even
though the Executive Committee has received an extensive
brochure from the group, there is not any first hand infor-
mation concerning the relative merits of membership. With-
out this knowledge of the practical aspect of the Association,
we feel it extremely unwise to take action until all the facts are
known. As for the political involvement, it should be pointed
out that these controversial resolutions comprise only about
ten per cent of the business conducted by the Association.

We are certainly aware of the many benefits which could
accrue to Washington and Lee as a result of membership in
this organization, if, indeed, its services function as they are
described. Perhaps the Executive Committee should avail them-
selves of the opportunity to hear personally from a represen-
tative of the Association which it is most happy to provide.
In any even a careful and dispassionate appraisal of the propos-
al must be undertaken if the EC is to fulfill its responsibility to
the students of Washington and Lee.

 

University Forsakes Heritage
New Buildings Feeble Follies

By NICK RUFFIN

Not long ago architect Edward
Durell Stone said of the City of New
York, “If you look around you and
you give a damn, it makes you want
to commit suicide.” I think the same
could be said for the situation at
Washington and Lee.

Washington and Lee, unlike many
colleges, was not originally saddled
with a collection of architectural
monstrosities whose only worth was
the fond memories they provide for
the alumni. The Washington College
Group, Newcomb Hall, Tucker Hall
and Lee Chapel form one of the most
handsome college settings in the
country.

But to praise the original campus
is net my purpose today. The uni-
versity has forsaken its heritage by
scarring the campus with such feeble
follies as duPont Hall, the New Sci-
ence Building, the student union,
and the new dorms. Of the new
buildings, the Evans Dining Hall
alone has merit.

The more recent additions to the
W&L campus appear to be products
of the Jello School of Architecture.
Some imaginative person pours
bricks and white columns into a
mould, shakes well and waits for the
mixture to harden. For buildings of
different sizes, a larger or smaller
mold is used. The results are spec-
tacular. They would please anyone
who judges the quality of a building
by the redness of its bricks or the
whiteness of its columns. (Sometimes
the bricks are not red enough, so
they are painted purple.)

The new dorms have all the digni-
ty and charm of a self-service funer-
al home. The student union is large-
ly useless space; the bare tile floors,
bare walls and spare furnishings are
reminiscent of the guest quarters at
Andersonville. Only the U.C.A. room
provides attractive surroundings.
The New Science Building presents
us with a monolithic mass. It has
no symmetry; white pilasters are
randomly abandoned on its facade.
One expects the oppressive pile to
eore into the ravine. And finally
there is duPont Hall. How ironic
that it should house the Fine Arts
Department. I am surprised that
anvone in the arte can be convinced
to enter the building.

Some say the architecture, or lack
ai it, in a building is a reflection on
the men who built it. To look at
WAL’ « most recent offerings, I would

 

judge the men ultimately respon-
sible for them to be uninspired, pe-
dantic, and aesthetically impover-
ished. This is harsh critism to
level at the administration and the
Board of Trustees. Rather, I imagine
the problem is one of neglect and
not of conscious blundering.

It comes to mind at this point to
ask who is the university architect?
His name is never mentioned in an-
nouncements. 1 am sure he is more
than competent and if given free
reign, could do a creditable job.
Unfortunately the evidence we have
would bring him critical acclaim
second only to that received by
George Stewart, the Capitol Archi-
tect.

A number of other colleges often
choose architects of national repu-
tation, Saarinen, Yamaski, Pei,
Stone, Le Corbusier, Rudolph, John-
son, and Nervi for example. By
choosing an outstanding architect
the college may be rewarded with
both an outstanding building and
national recognition as a result of
the building.

To expect that each new building
will be a significant advance in arch-
itectural achievement is unrealistic.
The least that can be expected,
though, is that a building not be a
regression, and that it not detract
from its surrounding. To copy the
past is to maintain the the level
previously achieved. The problem
with the new buildings at Washing-
ton and Lee is not that they are
copies of the past, but that they are
poor copies. The balance, harmony
and proportion found in notable
Georgian and Greek Revival struc-
tures is missing in W&L’s new build-
ing. The fundamental principles that
are found in the original buildings
at Washington and Lee have been
denied

I think that a building should be
an expression of its time. A well
executed modern building would not
destroy the W&L campus. The use
of all available knowledge and ma-
terials in new campus buildings
seems especially appropriate at a
college which prizes intellectual hon-
ests

There will be a meeting of the
freshmen not affiliated with a frater-
nity Thursday, at 10 pm. in the
dorm lounge. Fred Mindel will

By WARD BRIGGS

Ed Side has brought two movies
to town this week, which may have
helped to settle or upset our dis-
tended Thanksgiving stomachs. The
first is Sweet Ecstacy, starring Elke
Sommer, the second, A Stranger
Knocks, with some grating Danes.
The first deals with an innocent
young man who falls in with a Mu-
tual Aberration Society, who at the
very end finds religion, and returns
to his wholesome actress (?) girl
friend. The second is about an es-
caping traitor who makes love to the
wife of a man he killed during the
war.

Both of these contained great
scenes of erotic pleasures (before
they got into the hands of the Mary-
land moralists, anyway) yet, there
is a difference between the two
which must be pointed out before
both are tossed in the same waste
basket.

The greatest criticism of censor-
ship in the movies is that the courts
and censor boards have concerned
themselves primarily with the mat-
ters of “borderline cases” in which
there has been considerable dispute
and great press agentry. while other
sheer “skin flics” have passed un-
noticed. Why should these movies be

so censored when we can all go up
to Roanoke or Richmond and see
much more, anytime?

The answer is that the Supreme
Court has made it the intention of
the law to leave the door of censor-
ship only “the slightest bit ajar,”
so as to protect the fundamental
freedoms of speech and press guar-
anteed by the Constitution. Only
those movies which have no other
“redeeming social value” shall be
censored. It then becomes the prob-
lem to find what exactly is obsceni-
ty and what is erotic realism.

As you may know, this matter is
usually relegated to a board of cen-
sors which decides whether a movie
is obscene or not, and whether or not
to show parts of the movie or all of
it.

Yet it seems that the distinction
has been made in the case of these
two movies. A Stranger Knocks re-
volves totally around a single scene
which crucially effects the action of
the script, which may have some
artistic justification. The “crucial”
scene of Sweet Eestacy only served
to show me what The hero really
came on board for and what I paid
the money for. It was, therefore, cut
from the movie.

 

The erotic realism of A Stranger

 

Knocks seems to reflect a bascially
healthy and therapeutic attitude to-
wards life. The denial of man’s basic
corporeality can only lead to dis-
tortions of the body image, which
have been shown to be responsible
for the mental states of depersonal-
ization and unreality which mark
more severe emotional disturbances
and give rise to movies like Sweet
Ecstacy or Promise Promise. On the
other hand, familiarity with one’s
body and a relaxed attitude to its
natural functions are prerequisites
of mental hygiene. Art which em-
phasizes these qualities is therefore
especially welcome at a time when
automation, push-button housekeep-
ing, mass production, and progres-
sive eradication of individual dif-
ferences make everybody’s search for
identity a matter of spiritual ur-
vival.

I am glad to see Stranger Knocks
go uncensored, and I unquestionably
endorse a realistic representation and
education of life (my chief objection
to Ecco) which does not stop short
of acknowledging and providing for
the individual’s physical and emo-
tional needs. This seems to me a
more realible prophylatic against de-
linquency crime and mental illness
than denial, suppression and author-
itarian rule.

 

Contemporary Author Tells All

 

By BRUCE W. RIDER

As I was loping about our fair
(not good, just fair) campus the
other day, I was
delighted to find
that one of Wash-
ington and Lee’s
many great liter-
ary products had
just been pro-
duced.

I borrowed sev-
enty-five cents
from a rich pro-
fessor and bought
my copy of our
enchanting stu-
den magazine, Malarial.

And, wonder of wonders, what
should I find but a kind and charm-
ing interview by the Malarial editor
with Goliath Smackem.

In case all the copies of Malar-
ial were sold out before you could
procure (get) one, we herewith
present parts of the interview for
your interest and edification.

Interviewer. “Do you have, Mr.
Smackem, any favorite authors be-
sides yourself?”

Smackem. “No.”

Int. “Not a one?”

Sm. “None.”

Int. “I see.”

Sm.“Um.”

Int. “Well, then, what do you
think of today's best-selling writ-
ers?”

Sm. “They're all terrible.”

ones were there,
of course, but they
were in a minori-

other segments of the crowd were a
large number of post-college adults,
many of whom had their children
with them, and the usual large num-
ber of middle-aged women that
such events generally attract. The
largest part of the group. however,
consisted of very normal high school
and college students. There were

Int. “Why, Mr. Smackem, so?”

Sm. “They should write about
something they know. All they ever
write about is—of all things—con-
temporary America.”

Int. “What should they be writ-
ing about, Sir?”

Sm. “About things they know,
like India and South America and
Germany.”

Int. “I see.”

Sm. “Um.”

Int. “What do you think about
America’s younger novelists?”

Sm. “To be quite frank, young
man, I don't think anybody can
write worth a damn who is under
forty.”

Int. “What about people who are
over forty?”

Sm. “People over forty are too old
to write.”

Int. “How old are you, Mr. Smack-
em?”

Sm.

Int. “Are you going to write any-
thing about America?”

Sm. “Why should I? Anybody can
write about America, fella, but how
many can write about the Azetecs?
Answer me that,”

Int. “I see.”
Sm. “Um.”

Int. “Would you comment on such
writers as Norman Mailman and
Small Bellows?”

 

Sm. “They are unworthy of even

Unfortunately, several groups, almost

advantage of the situation to peddle

a voluminous amount of propaganda
including the Communist Worker.

Int. “I don’t know just how to

isn't there anything you like?”

Sm. “Well, to tell the truth, it
never occurred to me to think of
things in those terms. Do I like any-
thing? Um. Well, yes, as a matter of
fact: I like me.”

Int. “What are the current trends
in American letters?”

Sm. “American literature is, to be
blunt, going to Hell in a wheelbar-

Int. “Is there any hope for this
country’s literature? I mean to say,
Mr. Smackem, are there any rays
of hope shining even dimly through

Student Opposes NSA;

Cites Background, Policy
To Show Biased Opinion

To the Ring-tum Phi:

When the minutes of the Execu-
tive Committee meeting for No-
vember 30 were posted on the bullet-
in board, I was amazed to see that
the Committee was considering
membership in the National Student
Association. With the publication
of the article in Friday’s R-t P list-
ing the reasons given by President
Fred Mindel for membership. I was
no longer amazed, just angry.

What disturbs me and a good num-
ber of other students with whom I
have spoken is that Mindel did not
tell the whole story. He suggested
the advantages offered by the serv-
ices which NSA alledgedly provides.
But—he did not bother to tell the
TC, apparently, some facts which
probably should be considered.
Some of them follow.

A. The constitution of NSA pro-
hibits political activity, yet since
1961, NSA has consistantly partici-
pated in polities by:

1. urging the abolition of HUAC

2. urging unilateral disarmament

3. condemning United States in-

tervention in the Dominican Re-

publie

. urging the admission of Red

China to the UN

urging the immediate cessation

of bombing of North Viet Nam

and unconditional negotiation

. conducting an attack on the
American college fraternity sys-
tem.

B. NSA claims to represent the
students of the America and their
opinion, yet I would suggest this is
impossible for:

1. only 20% of the nation’s colleges
and universities are members
only 45% of these send delegates
to the national convention which
Mr. Mindel says makes state-
ments of interest to the student
on international issues.

. more than 30 major schools have
quit NSA since 1961. including
Indiana U., Ohio State,North-
western, and the University of
Texas.

4. Over a dozen schools have re-

fused to join NSA since 1961,
including Purdue, George Wash-

Washington, U.Va., American,

and most important, Washing-

ton and Lee. That's right, W&L

refused to join before so why

the sudden change?

C. Mindel listed a number of na-
tional leaders who have endorsed
NSA. I would suggest that those en-
dorsements were made prior to the
big change in NSA policy which oc-
curred in 1961, and I would ask Min-
del to update the references.

on

2.

D. As to the provision of serv-
ices to member schools mentioned
earlier, even that is not what it
seems. I would ask Mr. Mindel to
write to NSA for some of the infor-
mation he suggests is available, and
see how long it takes to get it, if he
gets it all. The major interest of
NSA is politics, not education.

The indictments run on and on.
I have only suggested a few. Yet
NSA would quite justifiably claim
that W&L supported the policies
mentioned above if we were to join.
WA&L would lend its honor and pres-
tige to an organization, which blat-
antly violates its own constitution,
and consistently distorts and lies
about student opinion which it
claims to represent. I would hope
that the EC will give a lot more
thought to the proposal te join NSA,
and I would further hope that those
students who find themselves op-
posed to membership in NSA will
take time to express that opinion,
especially to the BC.

Morrison Leads Generals
To First Win Of Season

Saturday night Washington and
Lee put an end to its losing ways,
defeating North Carolina Wesleyan,
86-89, on the loser’s court. Frank
Morrison came off the bench to score

21 points and lead five scorers into

double figures. W&L raced to a
41-29 lead at the half and then
played even ball with their op-

ponents during the second half as
they outscored Wesleyan, 45-50, to
notch the initial win of the season.

First Win in Four Starts
This win would be significant if
only for the fact that the Generals
broken into the win column
after three games. Last year it was
thirteen games before W&L could
show a victory for its efforts.

have

Canfield Optimistic
Coach Canfield is optimistic about
squad which consists of five
freshmen, two sophomores, three
juniors, and two seniors. His cause
for optimism comes from the early
performances of his young boys,
the balanced scoring of the team,
and the attitude of the players. Rob
Bauer, a freshman forward, and John
Carrere, a freshman guard have
turned in sparkling games thus far,
and both among six players
averaging in double figures.

Top Players
The two seniors on the team, cen-
ter Bob Spessard and forward Steve
Sweitzer, are also scoring in double

figures and in Coach Canfield’s
words “they have played up to ex-
pectation and I am very pleased

with them, especially Spessard who
is playing his best ball ever.” Jody
Kline, a sophomore and other start-
ing guard, and Morrison, an in-
valuable sixth man, are the other
two in double figure scorers.

Morale High

Team morale is high even though
the Generals lost to Bridgewater and
Old Dominion College, with both
opponents scoring over the hundred
mark. Canfield is quick to note that
the point difference was
large in the team’s two losses, the
boys have not quit, but instead have
played more determinedly when they
were behind. Canfield feels this is a

though

good sign

Season Appears Good

It is this balance scoring, high
morale, and fine play of the new boys
which Canfield feels constitutes a
better team than last year and one
which could end up with a .500 sea-
This would be a tremendous lift
for the basketball program at W&L,
but it entails hard work on the part
of each individual and the cohesive-
ness of the players as well as awell
rounded basketball team.

will be the Generals’ toughest game

ODK Changes
To February 22
As Tap Date

This past May, ODK presented to
the Executive Committee of the Fac-
ulty a request that in the future the
annual Tap Day Ceremony be held
on February 22 (or as close as pos-
sible thereto) instead of during the
first week in December.

The purpose of the suggested
change was two-fold. First, there
may be some students who would
qualify for membership in ODK in
every area except they fall just
short of being in the upper 35 per
cent of their class( this being the
academic requirement). The pro-
posed change would give them the
benefit of an additional semester
in which they might raise their
overall GPR.

Secondly, ODK inevitably begins
each academic year with an under-
graduate membership of only three
or four students. In an effort to en-
large this core, it is felt that here,
again, an additional semester would
enable it to give closer considera-
tion to the junior class, juniors hav-
ing had that much more time to dis-
tinguish themselves.

The date was suggested in the
spirit of providing an appropriate
and fitting tribute to our co-founder,
George Washington.

The Faculty Committee acted fav-
orably upon the request with the
change becoming effective this year.

Swimming Team

Drops 50-40

Match To Catholic University

Washington and Lee’s swimming
squad encountered its first setback
of the young season in a highly com-
petitive meet with Catholic Univer-
sity of Washington, D.C. The slight
50-45 margin of victory for the op-
position was determined in the last
event of the contest.

In an overall strong team effort
against the highly regarded squad
of Catholic U., W&L achieved four
first place finishes and displayed im-
pressive depth by gaining four sec-
ond places and eight third places.

The first event of the meet, the
medley relay was won by Pat Cos-
tello, Bill Ball, Bill Wildrick, and
Bart Taylor in 3:54.7, a new pool rec-
ord. Then Gary Bokinsky brought
home first place honors by accom-
plishing a 29.3 clocking in the 60
yard freestyle. This was followed by
Nelson Head’s triumph in the 200
yard backstrock, and Costello’s 2:29.8
victory in the 200 yard backstrock.

Before the final even of the meet
Washington and Lee was ahead, 45-
43. However, the 400 yard freestyle
proved to be the Generals downfall
in spite of a brilliant 3:33 effort.

This loss resulted in the 50-45 tally
favoring Catholic U.

According to Coach Norris East-
man, this meet represented a “tre-
mendous effort on the part of the
team in which all of our away team
records were broken.” Furthermore,
at this early stage, the squad’s times
are almost even with last year’s per-
formances at the end of the season.
Within the near future many school
and pool records should fall to the
improving hard working, spirited
1965 Washington and Lee swimming
team.

Americans would favor a UN-nego-

divergent opinions on what was real-

Drugger belittled fear of China say-

be dealt with as a sick and weak

land war of massive destruction. One
asserted that a direct confrontation
with China could only result in an-
nihilation of the world.

The irreconsilable view points sug-

the basic drive of thought that war,
all war, is evil and it must be end-
ed forever before we are to

Communist are truly interested in

the contrary is the evidence of the

In all this is the everlying tragedy
of our time. We, who truly want
peace and the betterment of the

but are being pulled helplessly down
the road of ever mounting massive

topic next week for interested fac- |
ulty members and students.

Dean John will meet with faculty |

and staff members at 7:30 p.m. on
Monday, December 13, in Newcomb
8.

Dean John’s meetings with stu-
dents are scheduled for 2:15 p.m.
on Tuesday, December 14, and for
7:30 p.m. on Wednesday, December
15, both sessions in Newcomb 8.

A 12-page summation of material
on the Student Life section of the
Self-Study is being distributed by
Dean John to faculty and to stu-
dents. Copies have been mailed to
student leaders, and individual stu-
dents interested in having copies of
the summary can obtain them in Mr.
Parsons’ office on the third floor of
Washington Hall.

The summary deals with all as-
pects of student life except social
fraternities, a sub-section still un-
der study by a special sub-commit-
tee. Covered in the Student Life
major category are student govern-
ment, the Honor System, orientation
and counseling, student discipline,
religious life, student publications,
intercollegiate and intramural ath-
leties, student health services, extra-
class physical facilities, and extra-
class student activities.

The purpose of Dean John’s open
discussion is to provide faculty and
students a chance to examine the
general approach the Self-Study
committee has made to Student Life,
the questions that have been raised,
and the various recommendations
that have been suggested in the

Joe Miller, president of Fancy
Dress Weekend, has announced that
Nina Simone, pianist and _ singer,
will appear with Ian and Sylvia at
the Saturday evening concert, Jan-
uary 30.

Miss Simone, one of the “most
listened to” popular folk singers for
the past six years, is especially noted
for her ballads and blues, which she
sings in Old English, Israeli, and
other ethnie styles. Her haunting
voice, as she accompanies herself
on the piano, has been described
as “among the most distinctive.” Her
background was primarily classical,
but her talent for improvisation and
an interest in jazz assured her suc-
cess when she first appeared in a
nightclub in Atlantic City in the
summer of 1959. She studied piano
under Carl Friedberg at the Jul-
liard School of Music in New York.

Speaking of her in Down Beat
magazine, critic John Wilson com-
mented that “she is not, of course,
#exactly a jazz performer—or, pos-
sibly, one should say that she is
much more than a jazz performer,
for her piano playing certainly has
jazz colorations—but she is an ex-
citing entertainer.”

Ranking highest in popularity
among the more than two dozen al-
bums which she has recorded are
“Nina at Town Hall,” “Nina at the
Village Gate,” “Nina at Newport,”
“Nina at Carnegie Hall,” “Nina in
Concert,” “Don’t Let Me Be Mis-
understood,” “Broadway, Blues, and
Ballads,” “Love Me or Leave Me,”
“Folksy Nina,” “Nina Sings El-
lington,” “Forbidden Fruit.”

Ian and Sylvia, Canada’s most
notable folk singers and folk com-
posers, will round out the concert.
Their original composition, “Four
Strong Winds,” has become a stand-
ard | in the folk field. “Un Canadien

will be given out to those attending |
so that they may sing along with |

the language students.

Naturally the stress will be on
Christmas songs, but there will also
be traditional songs, folk and popu-

Costumes To Be Available
Next Monday and Tuesday

Errant,’ another original, has been
called “the most carefully wrought
musical work, the most meaningful,
the most significant to come out of
the current interest in folk.” They
have become one of the country’s
most sought-after concert and night-
club attractions.

Roy Tyler, vice-president in charge
of costumes, reminds students that
costumes for the Ball can be rented
on Monday and Tuesday of next
week from 9 to 4, in the Student
Union. Jockey costumes, Kentucky
Gentleman outfits, and numerous
others in keeping with the “Derby
Day” theme will be available. The
dance’s costumers, Oak Hall of Roa-
noke, have also agreed to rent out
any other costumes in their stock—
Spanish dancers, for example, and
several animal costumes, such as
lions, tigers, pussy cats, and even
gorillas. Tyler added that since the
themes of Fancy Dress for the four

years past have been Civil-War-ori-g —————_____-

ented, such costumes will have to be
specially requested.

Costumes will be available on one
more occasion, after Christmas, but
students are advised that rentals
will be on a first-come basis, and
with the large number of students
anticipated to attend the Ball, Tyler
commented that as many students as
possible should take advantage of
next week's fittings. Students not
in costumes will be required to wear
full dress—white tie; tuxes will not
be acceptable dress. Rental prices for
costumes will begin at $6.50.

 

Governor Smylie To Speak
Tuesday Night In Chapel;
YR Dinner Also Planned

Governor Robert E. Smylie of Ida-
ho will speak Tuesday, December 14
at 8:00 p.m. in Lee Chapel. His topic
has not yet been announced.

The Governor is currently Chair-
man of the National Republican
Governors’ Association.

The tentative schedule calls for a
press conference immediately upon
his arrival at Woodrum field in Roa-
noke Tuesday afternoon. Following
the press conference, he will proceed
to Lexington where he will meet
briefly with the Mock Convention
Coordinating Committee before at-
tending an informal dinner with the
officers of the Young Republican
Club. He will speak at 8:00 in Lee
Chapel.

Governor Smylie, having originally
taken office in 1954, has been re-
elected twice since, thus casting him
into the position of senior Governor
in the United States.

Monday, Governor Smylie will in-
troduce a formal resolution to the
Republican Coordinating Committee
to disassociate itself with «¢ extremist.

“More than just

The EC voted Tuesday night to
submit the question of whether W&L
should join the National Student
Association to a student referendum
and discussions by the newly-organ-
ized ODK Leadership Forum in Feb-
ruary.

The action was taken as the result

members as to the wisdom of joining
the organization without consulting
student opinion.

Gayner, representing the W&L chap-
ter of Young Americans for Free-
dom, a conservative group, appeared
before the EC at Tuesday's meeting
to state their objections to the na-
tional organization.

NSA's political views had pre-
viously been attacked by a letter
from Wainscott in the Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi, in which he stated that
“the major issue of NSA is politics,
not education,” and added that
“(Mindel) did not bother to tell the
EC, apparently, some facts which
probably should be considered.”

It was made clear at the meeting
however, that Mindel had discussed
NSA's political stands with the EC
in its meeting on Nov. 31. Wain-
scott apologized, saying that he had
been unawere of this discussion.

In reply to other objections, Min-
del pointed out that the organiza-
tion's resolutions on international
affairs make up only a very small
minority of the resolutions adopted
annual congress, while the
majority deal with purely campus

 

issues
He added that schools which do
not agree on an issue adopted by

EC Calls Student Referendum

On National Student Association

the Congress are not required to as-
sociate themselves with any given
resolution, but can instead associate
with other dissenting schools in a
minority report.

“We've got to be heard,” he said.
“We're doing nothing by just sitting
back. . . . I don’t think it can pos-
sibly hurt to get in, especially in
light of the valuable services which
the association can render; a fact
which no one in the EC disputes.”

Stating that “many of the assump-
tions and statements in Mr. Wains-
cott’s letter are not true and that
the true facts will be brought out
shortly.” he also said, “This is the
type of issue which must be looked
into carefully. It's a much more com-
plex subject than first appears.”

On suggestion of sophomore rep-
resentative Richard Nash, the dis-
cussion by the ODK forum and the
referendum will be put off until
after Feb. 1, in order that all the
facts may be adequately presented
and so that Christmas and exami-
nations are out of the way.

Two speakers are to be brought
to the Forum to debate whether
W&L should join the NSA. NSA has
already expressed its willingness to
send a representative to any pros-
pective member school, while the
Young Americans for Freedom chap-
ter has agreed to obtain a suitable
conservative speaker to discuss the
disadvantages of membership.

In further action Tuesday night
the EC heard Library Committee
chairman Randy Chitwood’s report
on the committee's plans for a used
book market to be established at the
end of the semester.

THE RING-

Che Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Friday Edition

 

Examinations Flexibility

Monday’s action by the faculty changing the automatic
rules must be lauded as a giant step forward in granting Wash-
ington and Lee students more academic responsibility. This
move, coupled with last year’s action liberalizing the cut sys-
tem, leads the Ring-tum Phi to believe that the faculty views
today’s student body as possessing a more mature attitude than
those in the past.

In this same spirit we would like to suggest that the faculty
consider a possible change in the examination system. Under
the present system our exams are placed in a rigid schedule
which allows no flexibility. This academic Russian-roulette
each year cost many students marginal grades and to a large
extent leads to examination frustration.

Since the computer considers the course numbers only, and
not the individuals involved, many schedules come out look-
ing like endurance races with a semi-vacation tucked in between
the laps.

Many factors enter into getting “up” for an exam and
these factors differ with as many students are are taking a
particular course. Some would rather “grind it out” for a short
period while others prefer to pace themselves and still others
prefer short sprints with rest inserted. Also in grouping exams
most students like either all their tough courses first, last, or
sprinkled among easier courses. Invariably many students are
not matched with their “‘styles.’’

It is theoretically true that students should study during the
entire semester and exams should present no problem, but not
many either in the student body or faculty can claim that exams
have not caused cram sessions during their academic careers. In
fact, by the senior year many students add and drop courses on
the basis of their exam schedule.

In an age when academic excellence can spell the differ-
ence between success and failure, acceptance and rejection,
a better program at W&L could be worked out.

Washington and Lee is nationally known for its honor
system. Why should we require specific periods for exams?
Randolph-Macon, for example, allows students to take their
exam anytime during the exam period. Other schools offer
two or three sessions during which an exam can be taken.
Why are these systems not applicable here?

Many would argue that it causes complex grading prob-
lems. Consider the present system which puts the entire load on
professors who teach several sections of a course which has its
exam on the last, or next-to-last day. The natural “‘style”’ of the
individual student, it seems to us, will create a better distribu-
tion than the present system. Who wants five tests on the last
three days? If anything it will encourage students to take their
tests early to give themselves a longer vacation.

Now look at the exam schedule belowe and decide if it pro-
vides the flexibility you would like if you had your choice.
Then, please check the questionnaire and drop it by the Ring-
tum Phi office with any comments you wish to make. Your
responses will be given to Dean Atwood.

(See preference box page 4)

Beunlaction Schedule

January 17, 1966 through January 27, 1966

It is the responsibility of each student to know the time and place of meet-
ing of each of his examinations. The hours for examinations are 9:00-12:00
and 2:00-5:00. Any student more than five minutes late must present a satis-
factory reason for his lateness to be allowed to take the examination.

The omission by a student of any regular examination causes him to for-
feit his place in the class and to receive grade F for the semester, unless he
is excused for reasons deemed sufficient by the Dean and instructor con-
cerned.

Fraternal Vacuum Captured By Artist

 

By KAZ HERCHOLD

Within the vacuum tube that con-
stitutes a college community, reality
at best only illuminates the outer
limits of the college man’s waking
hours. The trappings of a life re-
moved and cloistered for four years
from the real world appear con-
spicuously not only in a man’s sen-
sibility, but all over the physical
plant in which he moves.

The sears of high-powered party
weekends where inebriation is the
price of peace are etched forever into
the walls of fraternity houses. “All-
nighters” owe their existence to mis-
direction in the never ending search
for academic bliss. No-Doz, dex,
Piping Rock, Jack Daniels, or any-
thing which produces equivalent de-
sired effects compose the average
student's survival kit. And the car-
icatures which dot fraternity house
dining room walls perhaps most
uniquely portray in one great mont-
age effect what Joe College is all
about.

The caricatures serve a purpose far
beyond that of the feeble efforts of
self styled interior decorators. Fra-
ternity men can effectively use them
to impress rushees, terrorize dates,
and shock mothers. And the man
responsible for the scintillating art
work is a bearded Dutchman, named
Pol Van Geel.

Pol, who visits Washington and
Lee every two years, started out as
a musician. After an abortive fling
at that profession, he began studying
art at Antwerp Academy. Upon
graduation, Pol drifted around Eu-
rope drawing political cartoons prior
to coming to the United States in
1938.

In 1940, completely by chance, he
encountered full-blown for the first
time, the American college world in
the person of a now anonymous
Washington and Lee Phi Gam. The
student observed Van Geel doing
caricatures at a newspaper editors’
convention in New York and in-
vited him to Lexington to immortal-

 

Pol
“snickers and screams”

ize the well-serubbed faces of fra-
ternity brothers. Van Geel accepted
and the opportunity for biennial

rors which traditionally would in-
sure the downfall of each succeeding
generation, Pol simply offers, “I
would never judge a boy by what
I see of him in college. He is abso-
lutely not willing to be overly ser-
ious about anything.” He finds no
evil in what young people do, em-
phasizing what he calls their “amaz-
ing capacity for intolerence of each
other.”

Pol’s optimism, respect, and ability
to both understand and fraternize
with the college set guarantee a
warm reception and ready accept-
ance at the campuses he visits. As
the years pass, he continues to de-
rive the greatest satisfaction from the
way in which a fraternity house wel-
comes him back.

Approximately sixty years old, Pol
now restricts his itinerary to four
schools, Denison, Ohio Wesleyan,
Bowling Green, and Washington and
Lee. Preoccupations differ in various
areas. Now both common knowledge
and Pol’s caricatures support the

Frazer: “An Island Isolated Unto Itself”

By SAM FRAZIER

This article commences a series
designed to examine Washington
and Lee from the critical point
of view of the student body. Each
writer answers the question,
“What does W&L lack most?”

For a senior who, by definition, is
not long for this particular world
and who has a good time here—has
even found the non-social aspects
of W&L pleasant—writing about
what is wrong with W&L seems
a rather ungracious act. Clearly there
are a number of things which are
definitely “right” about Washington
and Lee. There are obvious things
like the honor system, some of the
traditions, and the fact that here
you can find “bright young men”
who are not so aqueous that you
would mind drinking with them

Add these qualities to a highly
competent faculty and an intelli-
gent student body and you certainly
have a “good” school. W&L’s sin
not that it has fallen short of
being a good school but that it
could have been a lot better. Wash-
ington and Lee has become too much
of an island isolated unto itself and
as such has wasted too much of the
talent and promise of its members—
both faculty and student.

It is easy to explain away this
island charge by pointing out the
W&L's geographical location makes a
certain amount of isolation unavoid-
able. However, the problem is not
primarily geographical. In fact, a
certain amount of geographical iso-
lation can be helpful to a university
by giving it a chance to stand back
and take a detached view. This sit-
uation has never been harmful to
intellectual achievement. It is es-
sential to it.

Washington and Lee's failure is
that it has never gotten concerned
enough to take that view. It has

is

| too concerned with itself,

 

simply stood back. It has been far

 

 

with the
busywork of its own existence. There
are too many things here
ant things—to keep us busy. There
is simply no time left to consider
what we are doing and why.

Two years ago Dr. Duvall made a
statement in the Ring-tum Phi that
Washington and Lee students are
quite competent at digesting infor-
mation and regurgitating it in an
organized manner on quizzes and in
papers, but a bit short on originali-
ty.

There are several reasons for this,
I think. One of them is that profes-
sors really don’t require originality.
Usually well-organized regurgitation
is quite sufficient. But when origi-
nality is required, or at least urged,
too many students simply do not
have the time to invest the amount
of reflection which originality re-
quires. An unfortunate amount of
time is consumed by what can only
be described as busywork.

Beyond this, there is simply not
the inclination to be reflective. At
least a certain amount of the work
must be done, and that means either
overt studying or sneak studying, de-
pending on the mores of the indi-
vidual’s fraternity. When the work
is done, the student feels that he
owes himself a little fun. He fills
the rest of his time with road trips
and at least two flicks a week.

There is an obvious temptation to
place all the blame on the phenom-
enon of the Washington and Lee fra-
ternity. This would be an error, I
think, for the fraternity did not
create the monster. Ii is a natural
development from it. It the at-
mosphere here, the general attitude
that is the monster.

is

This charge applies to all mem-
bers of the University. It is just as
easy for the faculty to oceupy il-
self with its committee mectings and
busy little rules as it is for atude nts

 

—unimport- |

|

 

to spend their time at the Lyric and
Liquid. A case at point is the
Charles Milne Crisis last spring,

i when the faculty committee on cuts
| took the position that no matter what

the cireumstances, there could be no
exception to the cut rule.

It seems to me there should never
have been a crisis at all. One of the
arguments for the small college is
that its size allows a student to be
treated as an individual. A small
college can afford to consider the
circumstances and upon occasion
take exceptions to its rules. A large
university cannot. There is no ex-
euse for hard, fast, absolute rules
designed for the efficient adminis-
tration of 25,000 to 20,000 students
at a college of 1,300.

My argument is that we have mis-
placed values at Washington and
Lee. This University is an island in
the sense that here we have every-
thing necessary to keep up occupied,

but we have failed to consider
whether some of these things are
truly worthy of our attention. We

have coneerned ourselves with what

we are doing rather than what we
are becoming.
To be great, a university must

stand back and observe its society,
but even this self removal must be
an expression of involvement in so-
ciety. It must also be willing to stand
back and look at itself—to constant-
ly question its own direction, not just
make minor improvements.

Ships do come to islands. There
have been several encouraging re-
cent arrivals here. There are also
times when there is genuine thought
on substantative topies. This often
happens late at night after few
drinks, but it does happen even
among students. This real criticism,
then, must be that a few drinks are
usually required. As to how the
situation can be rectified. I have no
idea.

Kendrick and Bullitt)

Head 1966

Safety Bryant Kendrick and de-
fensive tackle Logan Bullitt have
been named Washington and Lee
football co-captains for 1966, mark-
ing the second year in a row that
defensive personnel have led the
Generals.

Linebackers Joe Miller and Jeff
Novinger, and defensive halfback
Billy Andrews were Generals’ tri-
captains this year.

Kendrick, a 5-10, 165-pound junior
from Greenville, S. C., was moved
to his safety post from quarterback
early this past season when W&L
began experiencing pass defense dif-
ficulties. He completed eight passes

Kendrick
Four Interceptions

of 18 attempts for 81 yards as the
Generals’ signal-caller through three
games, then turned around and in-
tercepted four opponents’ passes in
W&L’'s remaining six contests.

Bullitt, a defensive tackle through-
out the season until injuries slowed
him after W&L’s sixth game, is a
5-11, 215 pound junior from Eagles-
mere, Pa. Infrequently, he doubled as
an offensive end when mid-season
injuries hit that position.

“We couldn’t have picked better
men,” said head coach Lee Me-
Laughlin. “Both boys are outstand-
ing football players and excellent
leaders. Each showed that this past

season when they were still play-| |

ing despite injuries that should have
kept them on the bench.”

Bullitt pulled a leg muscle during

the Generals’ fourth game but con-| |

tinue to play in two or more. Ken-

drick played the entire last game|

against
spite a fractured rib and wrist.

For the moment, McLaughlin
plans to keep both players at their
present positions next season, but a
depth problem, one that’s sure to
arise since 21 players will be grad-
uated this June may force the W&L
coach to play Kendrick and Bul-
litt both ways.

“They could do it quite easily,”
said McLaughlin, “since each one has
experience on either team. They'd
have no trouble at all.”

Kendrick, a philosophy major, and
Bullitt, a history major, are two-
year lettermen with the Generals.

a record of one win and two losses,
meets King College tonight in Bris-
tol, Virginia, and Centre College of

According to Head Coach Verne
Canfield, King with five wins and
one defeat, has a good match-up de-
fense built on hustle and is “scrap
py” under the boards. The King
squad is led by 67” forward Erb
Burnett who has continually scored
in the high teens, but Canfield ex-
pressed optimism, asserting that Bob
Spessard, 65” W&L captain and cen-
ter, should be able to handle him.
Once again it is felt that control of

Centre College, two and one, was
“tough” last year and has ten re-
turning lettermen this year, includ-
ing stars Mike Marks and Julian
Palmer. In last year’s home game,
Marks tallied 32 and Palmer 28 as
Centre tipped the Generals 93-80.
In the CAC tourney it was Palmer
32, Marks 29 as Centre won 105-81.
Coach Canfield stated that this
year’s game should be a “good test
for the younger boys,” referring es-
pecially to freshmen John Carrere
and Rob Bauer, both starters.

Looking at the W&L squad as a
whole, Canfield said that “their de-

The W&L wrestling teams swing
into their dual meet schedules this
weekend as both varsity and the
J.V.’s have matches against the Uni-

Last year the Generals won the
varsity match 23-10, but the U.N.C.
has a good nucleus of lettermen in
Franusiszin, Hagerty, Jacobson, and
Johnson, insuring a far tougher
match this year.

The tentative varsity line-up finds

and Driseoll at heavyweight. Once
again, we state that these are only
tentative line-ups and are subject
to change.

Dean John To Conduct Student

Discussion On U niverstty Issues

By JOHN THEIMEYER
Assistant Dean of Students Lewis G. John, Self-study An-
alyst for student life, recently gave his report on the prelimi-
nary segment of the program. In the report he remarked that
each of the phases of student life have been subjected to
“criticism and questioning,” and that one subcommittee (on

social fraternities) has been formed.*—--——

Twelve Phases

The twelve phases of student life
under discussion are student govern-
ment, honor system, orientation and
counseling, student discipline, relig-
ious life, student publications, in-
tercollegiate and intramural athletics,
student health services, extra-class
physical activities, and extra-class
student activities.

In some cases recommendations
resulting from the study have al-
ready gone into effect. For example,
this year for the first time a student

affairs committee with four voting
student members has been created,
and is now in service. As other

proposals become appropriate they
will be incorporated into the system.

 

Dean Lewis G. John

Students had an opportunity to
participate in the discusion of this
preliminary report this afternoon
at 2:15 p.m. and may do so again
tomorrow evening at 7:30 p.m. in
Newcomb 8. Dean John will chair
these meetings and he will also be
available to discuss with individuals
the content of the report in his of-
fice from 2-4 p.m. on December 17

At a later date the subsommittee
fraternities will make its
report public. A summary on this
subject will be distributed, and ad-
ditional meetings scheduled for
open discussion

Copies Available

Copies of Dean John's
twelve page summation of material
on student life, have been mailed
to student leaders and faculty mem-
bers. Additional copic

The purpose of Dean John's open
discussion is to provide faculty and

Improvement In

North Carolina

Freshman Chris Mills
Ranked Second At
Dixie Classic

By ALAN COOPER

The debate team enjoyed what
Coach William Chaffin termed its
“best tournament of the year” Dec.
9-11, winning four awards at the
10th annual Dixie Classic Debate
Tournament at Wake Forest in Wins-
ton-Salem, N. C.

The Washington and Lee negative
team in the four man _ division,
| George Dover and Chris Mills, won
seven of eight debates, the best rec-
| ord in the tournament, to be named
| best in that group. They then lost
to Canisius’ champions of the two
|man division in a playoff and took
| second place overall honors for the
tournament

Mills Second

Of the 96 debaters repsenting 27
| schools, Mills was chosen second best
speaker, and Jim Hammill was rank-
ed one of the top ten. Hamill
picked up another award by win-
ing a special extemporaneous speak -
ing event

Chaffin described the performance
as “very gratifying,” since it broke
a four-year Classic jinx in which
the team had not done well

Winning Record

The debate team has had a win-
ning record in all seven tourna-
ments in which it has participated,
bringing home eleven trophies and
six certificates.

The team has no more major de-
bates until it travels to Ohio State

Tuesday Edition

 

A Lament: Traditional Apathy

We are reluctant to report that the opening meetings for
students on the progress of the Self-Study Program are very
poorly attended. This is particularly distressing in light of prior
student expression which indicates considerable interest in these

discussions.

The various sub-committees of the Self-Study have spent
much time and effort in the production of preliminary reports
designed to represent the deliberations of these groups, and to
give interested faculty and students the opportunity of raising
questions which may not have had adequate coverage. The re-
sponse to these meetings has been discouraging for the analysts,
and embarrassing to those few students who have bothered to

participate.

In order to present a more dramatic example of the inex: |e ws
cusable lack of participation, perhaps a few figures pertaining ||.
to the number of students present at the last two meetings
would suffice. At the meeting in the Commerce School there
were approximately ten (10) students at both the afternoon }
and the evening sessions. The College meeting elicited only
one hardy soul from among the ranks of the concerned and

creative.

This afternoon and tomorrow evening the report to stu-
dents on the progress of the Self-Study section on student life
will be presented in Newcomb Hall. This report deals with stu-
dent government, publications, athletics, discipline, and several
other topics pertaining to student life at Washington and Lee.
Dean John, analyst for this section, will be available not only
at these public meetings, but also for individual discussion of

the report.

Quite obviously the student life discussions are potentially
the most appealing meetings, but it is doubtful if the attend-
ance will undergo any significant change. The Ring-tum Phi,
however, wishes to urge students to take part in these meetings
for the simple reason that the faculty may not provide similar
outlets for student opinion in the future. We will agree with
the faculty’s present feeling that the student response thus
far does not warrant continued effort in this area. In spite of
this disenchantment with attendance the meetings are continu-
scheduled following the holidays. Cer-

tainly our obligation to the University requires firm support of

ing, and more will be

this program.

**True Green Spirit” Is Perpetuated

 

By S. T. Lowry
Department of Economics

Once there was a green family.
There was the Great Green Father,
the green mother, and five greenish
children. The family was constitu-
tionally dedicated to a diet of green
peas, green beans, and the dissemi-
nation of the spirit of the chloro-
phyllus life. It can thus be under-
stood when one day the Great Green
Father turned to his green wife and
said, “Our children are not as green
as they should be! in fact, they are
looking a bit bluish. This will be
ruinous to the family image and is
not good for them either.”

am, know,” sighed the green moth-

r. “It’s because they don’t eat well.

a, They are pickey at
the table and al-
_ though I try every

way to make peas
and green beans
appetizing and in-
teresting, they
just won't eat
’ enough of them to
' keep their color

‘i up.”

“Well, we just
won't put up with
that!” roared the
Great Green Father. “By Jove, I
will just make them sit at the table

 

“Great Green Father”

a full hour three meals a day, and
spoon it down their throats if I
have to. If they turn any bluer, my
image as “The Great Green Father’
will be destroyed.”

Digestive Difficulties

The green mother continued to
prepare green peas and green beans
with half hearted imagination, but
the greenish children stubbornly ate
less and less, and turned bluer and
bluer. The food that the Great
Green Father forced the greenish
children to eat didn’t seem to agree
with them. They had digestive dif-
ficulties and they became bluer and
bluer.

The Great Green Father roared
into the house one day tearing his
hair. “People are beginning to
doubt that our progeny is really
green!” he thundered. “I have tried
throwing green coloring on them as a
finish, but it just rubs off every
time they come in contact with
something, and the blue shows
through.”

Failed Them?

The green mother sighed, “When
they came into this world, they
were hungry for green. They were
suckled on green milk, and they al-
ways wanted more than I could
furnish. How have we failed them?”

“Failed them!” roared the Great

 

Green Father, “We just jolly well
will cut them off from the appetite
killing garbage they consume away
from home and make them eat more.
A father has to do his job”

The children resisted the father’s
restrictions more adamantly and
turned bluer and bluer. The Great
Green Father came to the end of
his rope.

Freudian Imagry

One day, he walked into the kitch-
en where the green mother was going
about her business preparing green
peas and green beans in new and
varied ways using a variety of cook
books that she had ordered from
many distant places. The Great
Green Father sat despondently
thumbing through the pages of some
of the books. “You know,” he said to
the green mother, “none of these
other families seem to be very con-
cerned with our type of problem.”
“Maybe this business of being a
Great Green Father is a bit heavy on
the Freudian imagry side.”

“You know,” said the green moth-
er, “I have been wondering about
that same sort of thing. I really don’t
feel that this role of being the ever
patient loving mother adds up to
much. You notice in this Tichifornia
meal ritual, they start with a com-
pletely different perspective in eat-

 

By WARD BRIGGS

Night Must Fall, presently at the
Lyric is a mess. But rather than cat-
alogue its mistakes, it might be
more useful to see what director
Karl Reisz was really up to. Point
one is that, in choosing to film
Emly Williams’ melodrama about a
psychopathic killer who carries his
victims heads around in a hatbox
and enveigles himself into the good
graces of an old lady and her daugh-
ter in a lonely cottage, Reisz was
making a deliberate breakway from
Saturday Night and Sunday Morning
and social realism. Point two is that,
equally obviously, although the orig-
inal play is foolproof on its own
level very little of its thriller-sus-
pense comes over on the film, so
one must assume that Reisz was out
for more than that.

The script, largely dispensing with
the old suspense motif in favor of
character and atmosphere, provides
a carload of morbid symptoms, allows
for a fine range of sexual fun and
games, and is evidently an attempt
to get inside the minds of both the
murder and victim. Much of the de-
tail is exacting and in
Danny’s horrifying little ritual dance
arount the hatbox, for instance,
which ends with him opening it in
front of a mirror and uttering a
bashful “Hello” to the contents. But
the film remains a series of discon-
nected fragments, unconvincingly
and flatly strung together. That there
was meant to be something more is
indicated by the last sequence in
which Olivia (Susan Hampshire) re-
turns to the house to find the muti-

Current Cinema

Briggs Sees ‘Night Must Fall’
As Break With Social Realism

lated corpse of her mother (Mona
Washburne), has a monent of panic,
calls the police, then goes upstairs
to confront Danny (Albert Finney).
Foolish girl, one thinks, but the kil-
ler cowers inexplicably behind the
washbasin.

Here one is in Antonioni country.
Right from the beginning of Night
Must Fall—Olivia dreaming on a
motionless swing in the hot summer
morning, the camera tracking
through the quiet trees ,the sudden
ery of a bird, the quick zoom in the
clearing where Danny hacks savagely
with an axe at his latest victim—
there is an evident atempt to evoke
characters in the terms of their sur-
roundings, which eventually gets
bogged down in overstatement and
preoccupation with narrative. For
instance when Clovia, the sleeping
princess aroused by a turbulent
love affair, realizes the truth about
Danny, Reisz has her weeping in a
cinema to the accompaniment of
cries, groans and explosions from a
war film; and the final sequence,
cross-cutting between Olivia desper-
ately mending a punctured tire while
Danny, back at the house, hunts her
mother with a meat-axe, owes more
to D. W. Griffith’s montage and
Emly Williams’ narrative than to An-
tonioni.

Nevertheless, it seems that Reisz
has chosen hackneyed personal vis-
ion, There are constant attempts at
distantiation especially in Danny
whose rapid shifts of mood are not
entirely accounted for either by his
madness or by his chameleon habit

 

of adapting his personality to suit

 

 

that of his interlocuter. Reisz dis
tantiates or attempts to by making
sharp cuts: for instance, from Danny
in a pathological rage with Olivia
after he has found her searching his
room, to him happily encouraging
her as she learns to ride his scooter
on the lawn.

One can only applaud Reisz’s
courage for making such a complete
breakaway from the brand of social
realism which has ended by strang-
ling the British cinema, and regret
that his leap into darkness only
landed him into a quagmire.

One day, someone is going to make
a film about a model (or movie star)
with a witty, daring and unconven-
tional theme. The heroine will make
a great deal of money; she will live
playfully and extravagantly: she will
marry even more money. The dar-
ing unconventional aspect of this
will be that she isn’t noticeably cor-
rupted by all this. But not yet. To
suggest that it is anything but ter-
rible at the top is apparently more
than flesh and blood can stand; and
the thing that surprises me about a
film like Darling (at the State) is
that people as sophisticated as John
Schlesinger and Frederick Raphael
should accept constrictions of so
many flatly fashionable attitudes.
Darling is sometimes clever, often
ugly, always self-conscious. But its
view of the world belongs in the
corriders of Park Avenue. Its disil-
lusionment looks like that of a gos-
sip columnist who has left a party
with a monumental hangover, but
will still be back the next day to see
how all the awful people will be
contriving to amuse themselves.

 

Campus Controversy Rages

 

By ROY TYLER

As the columns of the Daily Work-
er praise the work of National Stu-
dent Association, so do members
of the Washington and Lee Execu-

tive Committee.
Just what type
of organization

do these people

wish you, the
students of this
university,
to join?

You would not,
of course, be re-

quired to put your
name on the role
of the organiza-
tion, but you
would be a student at a school
which through NSA not only con-
demnsa the war in Vietnam, but has
made statements which make the
Kiu Klux Kian look like quite an
enlightened organization.

 

I personally would not like to be-
long to an organization which en-
dorsed the rioting Japanese who pro-

ta Japan, or who speak in favor of

 

Fidel
forms.”

In a letter to the editor of last
Tuesday's Ring-tum Phi, Jeff Wains-
cott made a rather extensive dis-
closure of the objectives and actions
of the NSA. I urge each student to
read it. Also, any interested students
can find an editorial in the December
6th edition of the Richmond News
Leader concerning the NSA.

In last Tuesday's Ring-tum Phi
there was also an editorial about
the organization. The editor remind-
ed the student body that we do not
have to interpret the utterences of
this organization to be representative
of the member schools. I ask, then,
if this organization is going to put
forth policies which we would, as
a member school, not condone, why
should we join the organization?

I also ask how we can join an
organization like the NSA, and not
be identified with the policies it
puts forth and the statements that
it makes?

policies of this organization, then I

known, but there is no reason to
think that we can join this organiza-
tion and only be identified with the
policies with which we agree. If we
join, we in effect, approve not only
the ideals for which this organiza-
tion stands (which, I might add, are
not followed particularly closely)
but for each statement of policy it
makes while we are members.

There must be some reason why
Hollins, Lynchburg College, and
Randolph-Macon Woman's College
have withdrawn from the organiza-
tion, while area colleges such as the
University of Virginia and George
Washington University have repeat-
edly refused to join. I am not say-
ing that we should not join merely
because these schools have not
joined, but there is obviously some
reason why these schools have re-
fused to join, and I do not feel it is
because they are too apathetic to be
eoneerned

I urge those who feel that they
cannot agree with the policies of
this organization to speak. Each stu-
dent can make his feelings known to

“Yes,” said the Great Green Fath-

“No” said the green mother, “I am
so sick of these brats that I could

it would serve them right.”

“You are getting your Freudian
roles mixed up,” smiled the Great
Green Father acidly. “I am sup-

tive and gentle.”

Tichigorina Menu

“Well, as long as you can be re-
flective and considerate, I guess I
can be assertive and hard boiled,”
snorted the green mother with her
hands on her hips, “We'll try the
Tichigorina menu and eating ritual
and see how it works. No child has
ever been known to starve himself
to death out of spite.”

“All right,” said the Great Green
Father, “but I sure would hate to
have the oldest turn completely blue.
He really has the makings of a really
great greener.”

“Now you are getting maternal”
snapped the green mother.

“Maybe all this business about
roles and obligations is just a bunch
of bogged down tradition that is
beginning to get in our way any-
how,” observed the Great Green
Father.

“Come and Get It”

The next day at noon, the green
mother started the new regimen. The
Great Green Father called the green-
ish children, now quite blue, to din-
ner in the Tichiforina manner,
“Come and get it before we throw
it out!” The food was plain and
straight. The greenish children
slunk sullenly in and looked sourly
at the unappteizing and meager ra-
tions of green peas and green beans.
“Eat if you want, or go on about
your business,” announced the Great
Green Father preemptorily. The
green mother went on about her
business preparing things she en-
joyed for herself, and which fre-

Rider Describes Attributes
Of Washington & Lee Now
In Special Yuletide Tribute

By BRUCE W RIDER

We are rapidly approaching the
Season To Be Jolly, and, in the true
spirit of Christmas, we thought we
would list four or five of the finer
qualities of Washington and Lee Uni-
iversity, qualities which all of us
here are most humbly grateful for.

First and foremost is that essense,
that true core, that one quality
above all others that makes our Uni-
versity what it is:

 

Secondly, we would all agree that
we are immensely proud of the fol-

lowing aspects of Washington and
Lee life:

Thirdly, we hold ever before us the
reminder that our University, above
all, is noted for:

And is there ever a dry Washing-
ton and Lee eye when we think
about:

Lastly, we know in our hearts how
fortunate we have been to be able to
participate in this, one of the finest
of our Washington and Lee tradi-
tions:

Now that we have seen how much
we have to sustain us here at Wash-
ington and Lee men, let us have a
most joyous Christmas. Whe ix more
entitled to it?

By TOM CARPENTER

Next Saturday is the last and cru-
cial day of the National Football
League Season, and the fans will
crowd around their tubes on Sat-
urday and Sunday to scope out
these key matches.

The Eastern Division was sewed up
weeks ago by the Cleveland Browns,
but second place is still up for
grabs. Fortunately the Giant-Cowboy
fame will decide who from the East
will go to Miami for the Meaning-
less Bowl, which is commonly called
the Playoff Bowl. A tie is as good as
a win for the Giants, while the Cow-
boys have to come out on top for
the trip.

Who's Best in the West?

The Western Conference is still in
a state of unsettlement. The Packers
have a half game lead over the Colts
and a game lea dover the Bears. The
Colts play the rolling Rams Sat-
urday in L. A. and must go into the
game as the underdog. The Rams
have been playing like God’s gift to
football as of late, while the Colts
have been unimpressive without the
aid of Johnny Unitas, the “man with
the golden arm.”

Bears Expecting Victory

The Bears play the hapless Vik-
ings and should have little trouble.
But for the Bears to tie for the title
the Packers and Colts both must
lose. The Bears are without a doubt

the best team in football, but have
been unable to overcome three con-
secutive defeats at the beginning of
the season. The Bears should at least
get a trip to Miami because the
Colts stand a very good chance to
lose to the Rams.

The Cardinals, the Redskins, and
the Vikings win the award for being
the biggest disappointments this sea-
son. The Cards have a good excuse.
They have been hurt in both senses
of the word. Star quarterback Char-
ley Johnson has played with an in-
jury or has missed games with an
injury with a frequency equal to a
man’s breathing rate. The Cards also
have had to play with their out-
standing defensive safeties, Larry
Wilson and Jerry Stovall, on the
bench because of injuries.

A New Charlie Taylor

The Redskins have played with a
Charlie Taylor who is not the same
as the Rookie of the Year 1964 and
without a fullback. Dan Lewis is
just an average halfback who should
not be playing fullback.

The Vikings have no excuse. They
have simply played miserable foot-
ball this season.

Saturday and Sunday should pro-
vide the NFL plenty of excitement,
as the teams play who will win the
Western Division. The tubes will be

 

running warm this weekend.

 

Canfield’s Club Coasts Down;
Depths Of Disaster Imminent

Over the weekend Washington and
Lee’s basketball fortunes were dealt
a setback as they dropped two games.
On Friday night at King College
the Generals experienced their
coldest game of the season from the
floor as they were able to hit only
16 per cent in the first half and 25
per cent for the entire game. With
King College hitting with a fair de-
gree of accuracy, it was pretty
much no contest with King trium-
phant, 83-59. Rob Bauer paced the
Generals with 15 points, and the
only other player to hit double fig-
ures for W&L was Frank Morrison
with 11 points.

Saturday night the Generals trav-
eled to Centre to play their first
conference opponent. Playing an im-
proved game, the Generals kept it
close until four minutes were re-

maining. At this point Bob Spessard, | ©

Steve Sweitzer, and Morrison were
all on the bench, having picked up
five points apiece. This cost
Generals’ attack its momentum.
Centre then won going away, 88-75.
Sweitzer was high for the Generals
with 19 points, followed by Bauer
with 17 and Morrison with 10.

underdog.

On December 17, the Generals

sity of North Carolina at Charlotte

Saturday night in the Doremus
Gym the Junior Varsity wrestling
team went down to defeat against
the JV from the University of North
Carolina, 33-3.

The JV lineup had Charlie Ben-
singer at 130, Dave Jackson at 137,
Mike McCreery at 145, Bob Munson
at 152, Zeltner at 169, Bill Ridley at
167, Scott Kennedy at 177, and Ed
Driscoll at heavyweight.

Fast-moving freshman Bob Mun-
son brought in the only points for
W&L on a decision victory over his
opponent. Randy Roper’s illness Fri-
day night sent sophomore Rollie
Jacobs to varsity 123, leaving that
position empty for the JV. Clark

Lowry On ‘Great Green Father’

(Continued from page 2)

quently
Father.

The greenish children whooped
with enthusiasm and rushed away
from the table thinking they had
won a great victory over their in-
transigent parents. The Great Green
Father sadly and uneasily looked at
the wasted food. The mother shrug-
ged, laughed, and scraped the plates
into the pigs trough.

Great Green Father Gratified

After a few days of the Tichifornia
plan, the oldest of the greenish
children began to realize how wan
and unpleasant one looked when one
was bluish and supposed to be
greenish, He started coming to meals
and eating. He was soon eating
ravenously and habitually, although
he didn’t show up from time to time.
The Great Green Father was quite
gratified, and the green mother be-
gan fixing special little green dainties
to go on his plate. The other greenish
children were so enthused about the
Tichigorina play they were turn-
ing quite blue before they real-
ized that a certain amount of green
peas and green beans are necessary
if one wants to pass one’s self off as
a respectable green. One of them,
however, had become so blue that
upon being caught up by an unex-
pected air movement, he was carried
off and disappeared into the wild blue
yonder where he blended perfectly.

Another became quite satisfied
with being blue and the Great Green
Father and the green mother sadly
saw him go trudging off to be a blue
instead of a green. The other two
were dangerously blue before they
began dragging themselves feebly in
to eat one or two meals a day.

Green Mother Relents
They were quite anemic from a

pleased the Great Green

 

green standpoint, and didn’t look
well at all with their sickly bluish
coloration. They couldn’t digest the
straight solid green diet. The green
mother relented slightly and gave
them a slightly thinned down fare
until their appetities were restored
to normal. Very soon, the three re-
maining greenish children were
hanging around the kitchen from
time to time and picking up snacks
even outside of the regular meals.
They continued to sample coarser
diets, but really found that for
greeners, the green diet really suited
best after all. The oldest even be-
gan to show signs of being a fairly
creative cook and the Great Green
Father started looking around to
get him apprenticed out to a spinach
or collard line.

The Great Green Father and the
green mother frequently mentioned
the two children they had lost when
they went on the Tichiforina Plan,
but the both agreed that this was
the price of perpetuating the true
green spirit.

Old Co-op To Be Renovated, Enlarged

36-Week, $100,000
Project Begins Soon

The administration announced this week the commence-
ment of $100,000 program of renovation and new construc-
tion on the long-empty Old Co-op building.

According to Mr. James W. Whitehead, Assistant to the
President for Administration, work on the building will begin

‘Dog’ Thomas
Entertains At
Moose Lodge

Rufus “Walking the Dog” Thomas
will entertain guests at the annual
University Cocktail Party of the
Fancy Dress weekend, Joe Miller,
President of the dance, announced
yesterday. The well-known enter-
tainer will perform at the Friday af-
ternoon affair at the Moose Lodge
from 4 to 6.

The announcement that Thomas
would play added a note of en-
couragement to what Miller called a
rather disappointing rental of cos-
tumes for the formal dance Friday
night, January 29. “A few have been
rented, but the turnout hasn't been
as great as we had hoped,’ com-
mented Miller.

Oak Hall of Reanoke, the dance’s
costumers, have already visted the
campus once, before the Christmas
vacation. Although the visit was an-
nounced as the final chance to ob-
tain costumes, another opportunity
will be provided when they return
next Wednesday, January 12.

In keeping with the “Derby Day”
theme, such outfits as Kentucky
gentlemen, jockeys, and others will
be offered at prices starting at $6.50.
Miller emphasized again that no one
will be admitted to the dance with-
out either a costume or full formal
dress: white tie and tails.

Miller reported that this year’s
dance set will feature two firsts: It
will be the first time in four years
that there has been any choice in
costumes—the last dances have re-
volved around Civil War themes.
Also for the first time in four years,
extensive decorations will be used
for the Ball. Miller said that the
committee will have professional
help when they begin the decorating
of the Dining Hall Sunday.

The signing of Thomas completes
the lineup of entertainment for the
weekend, which features Stan Rubin
at Friday's ball and Nina Simone

 

and Ian and Sylvia at the Satur-
day night concert.

Fancy Dress?

Fancy Dress, renowned as the South’s Outstanding Social
Function, may not be so fancy this year; in fact, unless student
interest reverses, it may not draw enough people to fill a good-
size fraternity basement, much less Evans Dining Hall.

Thus far costume sales have totaled less than 100. Of the
students fitted by the Oak Hall Rental Agency before Christ-
mas, close to half included members of the figure or other of-
ficials for the ball. The miserable response to the fitting seems
clear indication of our student body’s bubbling school spirit.

In the past Fancy Dress marked the zenith of the Univer-
sity’s year. Presidency of the occasion was paralleled only by
chief executive of the student body. To hear a student mention
that he did not plan to date for the weekend was rare. Yet this
picture has completely changed. Why?

The quality of the weekend as far as entertainment and
decorations has not diminished nor has the work which goes
into planning Fancy Dress. The change has come in student
opinion. Most credit the change to a shifting of values within
the student body citing (1) more emphasis on academic work
and less on social, and (2) more sophistication within our com-
munity which makes attending Fancy Dress the “out” thing
to do. We tend to believe the second is the most accurate
justification for Fancy Dress’s decline but question the use of
the word sophistication. Snobbery, we believe, is a more ap-
plicable term.

Some feel that attending Fancy Dress lowers their “‘stud-
image’’ rating, and any occasion which draws together all mem-
bers of the student body must be designed for the “fish” and
not for them. This feeling of superiority is doing the Univer-
sity no good nor is it helping the individual who is THAT
concerned about how others view him. Yet this type attitude
cripples any and all attempts to draw the University’s students
together.

Many wish to call Fancy Dress a tradition and as a tradition
it must go. We feel people who attack traditions per se are
doing themselves a personal injustice. True, they lack meaning
to many who simply reject their existence without attempting
to examine or experience their value. Although it may seem
obvious to most, it should be noted that Washington and Lee
is considered a great institution not simply because we have
one of the top faculties in the nation, but also because the
University has been able to create something in addition to
(spirit maybe?) classroom classics.

Costumes will go on sale again next Wednesday in the stu-
dent union. We seriously doubt if many students will bother to
be fitted despite the fact this year’s prices are the lowest in his-
tory and this year’s weekend has the ingredients of excellence.
Many just are not interested in looking outside their own world.
Yet it is still nice to dream that possibly this year would reverse
the trend, this year would see the whole student body mixing
and laughing together, and this year would restore some of the
intangible qualities that have made Washington and Lee.

“What Does W@L Lack Most?”

 

This is the second of a series of
features designed to examine
Washington and Lee from the crit-
ical point of view of the student
body. Each writer answers the
question, “What does W&L lack
most?”

By BRUCE RIDER

There may have been, years ago,
something known as Washington and
Lee University, a place where stu-
dents were gentlemen, spoke to each
other, dressed decently, and acted
honorably. At this University there
may have been a certain atmosphere,
a certain creative spirit which serv-
ed to develop what was known as
the Washington and Lee man.

If such a University ever did ex-
ist, it is nowhere to be found in 1966.
Most certainly there have been and

Help! their grand

of the most signi-

the four Beatles
each going into a
separate door of
their house. The
house is a normal,
two-story red-brick affair, in a typi-
cal British industrial suburb. Across
the street, two women wave to them
and comment, “They’re still the same
as they was. Adoration hasn’t gotten
to their heads one jot.” Thus we have
the exterior image of the Beatles.

 

 

But as the film continues, we see
that the four houses are completely
different inside. They are one huge
room with a rising theatre organ,
several vending machines, and a
sunken bed for John. In short, a

world of fantasy.
In this world we can have any-

forts have not been at all success-
ful. Concerned critics have set forth
that if only students wore their ties,
if only students spoke on the cam-
pus, if only students honored the
University traditions—then, they say,
Washington and Lee would again
be its old fine self. But the spirit of
this University, whatever it was that
caused men to value its life and tra-
ditions, has died. No forcing of
obedience to rules, no patchwork at-
tempts to imitate the old way, will
bring back what has ceased to exist.

Today’s University is no longer
concerned with the development of
the whole man. Gone are the men in
the college administration and the
professors who valued the creative

traditions of the University, who
sought to share with the young-
er men an understanding of an

honorable way of life. Today’s

ination and 2) money. Is anything
dreary, stale, flat and unprofitable?
The Beatles will transform it to
something gay and lissome. As in
HARD DAY’S NIGHT they trans-
form a dreary baggage car by their
singing, so they imbue to the world
a sense that the truly marvellous life
is the imagination within.

In the same way that the Beatles
lent enchantment to the dreary world
of Liverpool, they have transformed
the image of Britain and set the tone
of youthful stylishness for the teen
generation.

The style is one of endless enter-
prise and inexhaustable industry
which threatens to tire towards the
end. Throughout the film there is a
visual quality and as _ thoughtless
and carefree as the singing itself.
Everything is lighthearted, every-
thing is played for laughs. During
the opening titles we see the Beatles
perform in faded black and white
while brightly colored darts and the
titles are thrown on the screen. Dur-
ing the Ticket to Ride sequence, we

do their jobs well as administrators
and academic teachers—but they do
not bother about the quality of life,
the quality of the individual, at this
University.

As students, we do not take par-
ticular pride in being Washington
and Lee men. The very idea of a
“Washington and Lee man” is for
us a meaningless concept. We are

Washington and Lee In 1966

common with men who have been
Washington and Lee men before us.
A few weeks ago the student body
had an opportunity to discuss Wash-
ington and Lee life with members of
the Self-Study committee. No stu-
dent attended the first meeting; four
came to the second. What’s in it for
Big Me?

We students today are much too
smart, too self-assured, too grown
up to concern ourselves with such
a useless thing as the quality of
University life. All of this is, at best,
unsophisticated, and who among us
would like to be thought unsophisti-
cated at the mature ages of nine-
teen or twenty-two?

What is wrong with Washington
and Lee University in 1966? Nothing,
really. Or everything. The academic
institution will continue to thrive.
Each year we admit better-prepared
and more intelligent students, and
the quality of education continues
to improve. The emphasis increas-
ingly will be on the academic—we
have little time or use for anything
else.

It is obvious that today’s student
at Washington and Lee is not partic-
ularly a gentleman, not particularly
well-spoken, not particularly neat,
not particularly honorable. But he
is well educated and he will do
well for himself in the big wide

world.

Let us pause, though, if only for
a moment, to remember that once
there was a creature known as the

Washington and Lee man, a man who
understood and accepted with pride
the values his University set forth.

The heart and spirit of Washing-

ton and Lee University are gone,

and few mourn their passing.

Editor Discusses Trivia--What’s New?

By CHARLIE BENSINGER
Dear Mom and Dad:

Remember when the rage was how
many students could fit into a VW
or phone booth?
Or the frisbie? Or
sidewalk surfing?
Now it is the mi-
nutiae, trivia, and
for lack of any-
thing better to do
we shall turn to
trivia within the
world of baseball
(spring training is
only three months

 

Bensinger away). :
One note, first:
I will not comment on the NFL

Championship for two reasons. First,
Piedmont Airlines had me flying all
afternoon. The first three airports
were fogged in and we made it to
Winston-Salem on gas fumes. Sec-
ond, I am a loyal Cleveland fan.

How many of you know the wild-
est pitch ever thrown in the major
leagues? Chuck Stobbs, the old
Washington southpaw, once threw
his curve ball twenty-six rows up
into the grandstand, and closer to
first base than to home. If there are
any doubts about the veracity of the
sage, ask Tom Carpenter. He was
there. Stobbs’ explanation, however,
is the true classic: it slipped.

The only pitcher in the history of
the World Series ever to lose a
ground ball in the sun and as a
result, the ball game, was the famous
Dodger Billy Lowes. Somehow I
think that Billy must have been put-
ting on the scribes.

The record for hitting into the
most outs in one nine inning game
belongs to Burleigh Grimes, another
Dodger of course. In three at bats
Grimes hit into two double plays
and one triple play—seven outs. Oh
yes, he also lost the game.

Question: who was the only man
ever to pinch-hit for Ted Williams?

Check. Kem White also won five
points by forfeit, and Don Patterson
followed up by scoring three points
in the last period for a 3-1 decision,
increasing the Generals’ lead to 13-3,

Charlie Slaughter and Bob Mun-
son, both promising freshmen, lost
close decisions, Jamie Andrew
came through with a win. Jay Clarke
then fought to a 1-1 draw, insuring
W&L of the victory, and Holmes
Raker put the icing on the cake with
a win at the heavyweight position,

Coach Miller expects only two
changes in this line-up for the R-P.I
match tonight at 7:00 in Doremus.
Rollie Jacobs, a winner his only time
out, will start at 123, and either
Dave Jackson or Mike McCreery will
gain the nod at 137

The Generals, with a 1-1 record
will be out to move over the 500

Answer: Carroll Hardy.

The shortest home-run on rec-
ord? This great blow traveled the
fantastic distance of six inches. Don’t
ask who hit it because I don’t re-
member, but it was on a cloudy day
and happened on a very muddy field.
The pitch was topped into the mud in
front of home plate, unbeknown to
everyone, except the batter. Before
the ball could be found, he had
scored, Needless to say, you may not
believe this one, but if you will let
me know, upon my return from
spring vacation (yes, I plan to come
back) I will bring the book of won-
ders.

Not so trivial is the problem of
Fancy Dress. As usual there are the
guys who make it tough for all
others—they have two dates too
many. They ditch two and thought-
lessly don’t give them to the guys
without. Of course, in the true
Charlie Brown spirit, half of these
guys will find out the day before
that they kept the wrong one—she
can't come.

Then there is the guy with two
girls, one at home and one at school.
Both want to come. To each Wash-
ington and Lee man with this prob-
lem, find your own solution—ours
don’t work.

A modification is the problem of
having a date at a neighboring and
then asking the girl from home, all
the time knowing that she can’t
come. It’s great for snow, but what
happens when suddenly she can
come. Even worse is the unan-
nounced arrival.

Men with problems like these of-

 

ten can’t even enjoy Fancy Dress. |
This is because they are just too}
darn tired. And as for second se- |
mester, it’s so much of a mental
down after these carnal gymnastics |
that it can be hard to stay in school |
for the next FD season. |
Now as promised last year, we will
report IM scores. That is, the ones
that we have. It seems that bowling

Miller Named As Finalis:
For NCAA Scholarship

Each year the National Collegiate
Athletic Association presents post-
graduate scholarships to athletes
displaying outstanding ability, lead-
ership, and scholarship. Joe Miller,
W&L’s All-State and All-CAC line-

man, was one of the ninteen finalists

in the 1965 football college division
competition.
Miller, a Delt senior from Nash-

ville, has been an outstanding mem-
ber of the team in his three years of
varsity eligibility and this year serv-
ed well as one of the General tri-
captains. In the field of academics,
Miller is a history major and this
year was nominated as one of
Washington and Lee’s three Rhodes
Scholar candidates.

Walter Byers, the Executive Di-
rector of the NCA\A, added in a letter
to Cy Twombly, who nominated Mil-
ler, that being one of the finalists
“is, in itself, a great tribute consid-

ering the number of outstanding
senior candidates across the coun-
try.”

 

Head Paces W&L Swim Team
To Victory Over West Virginia

Washington and Lee’s_ varsity
swimmers trounced West Virginia by
a score of 57-38 in the Doremus
pool last Dec. 17. The win brought
the team’s record to 3-1.

Sophomore Nelson Head was the
key man for the Generals with rec-
ord-breaking performances of 2:03.1
in the 200-yard backstroke and :56.4
in his leg of the opening medley re-
lay, which W&L took in 3:50. Head’s
teammates in that event were Pat
Costello, Bart Taylor, and Bill Clay.

Another W&L record fell as Ned
Lawrence placed second in the 500
freestyle in 5:37.3. Bill Wildrick and

By RON KESSLER

Washington and Lee’s_ varsity
basketball team dropped three in a
row over the Christmas vacation on
a disappointing road trip South,
bringing their record to two wins
and eight defeats.

Plauged by fouls, the Generals lost
a squeaker to UNC of Charlotte on
December 18, 78-76. With ten min-
utes to play in the fourth quarter,
the W&L top scorers fouled out.
A W&L foul in the last seven sec-
onds of play resulted in the loss.
According to Coach Vernon Can-
field, “We should have had this one
without doubt.”

Three bad passes and two missed
layups in three minutes of play were
the cause of defeat at the hands of
Florida Presbyterian University De-
cember 20, 69-59.

Sporting fifteen boys on full schol-
arship, Florida Southern completely
outclassed the W&L squad, 93 to
59. Canfield stated that Florida
Southern is the “one big team on
our schedule. They have the eighth
le ading defense in the nation, Our

Lynchburg December 17 by a score
of 70 to 51, holding high scorer
Wayne Proffit, whose average is now

ticularly in the jazz idiom, which
is a logical and potentially effective
vehicle for modern worship. Why
does the very idea fall upon deaf
ears?

The tragic answer is that tradi-
tional music makes everyone feel
comfortable. Within limits, of course,
this is fine; security is a universal
function of religion, and change for
its own sake is meaningless. As a
guiding force, however, “comfort” is
a travesty of the challenge which re-
ligion can and should put forth. And
while mere musical concerns are not
infallible indicators, they do have a
strong relevance; external practices
can provide interesting and some-
times disturbing clues to the internal
state of a community.

The Dream
And so, brethern, I have a dream.
It is Sunday morning in a large
Protestant church, and time for the
anthem, which is listed as “Variations
on ‘The Old Rugged Cross.’” But
the choir is not there. Instead, twelve

avant-garde composers arise and

begin their own anthem. Ten sing
“Glory to God!” in five different
keys; one plays an improvised alto
axophone solo; the other bounces
well-tempered tennis balls off the
pulpit.

Of the five hundred people pres-
ent, 475 run sereaming out of the
wnctuary. The remaining 25 watch
in fascination as a uniquely creative
and personal affirmation of faith un-
folds them

The anthem ends, and all is silent.
Then from the distance a Voice
speaks to the remnant, saying, “This
is My church; and I am well pleased.
Now +t down to business
around here.”

Dr. Cole To Address Founder's Day Assembly

 

Students Attend Self-Study
Discusston Last Monday

In a meeting Monday afternoon
with interested members of the stu-
dent body, Dr. Charles F. Phillips
led a discussion of issues pertinent
to the University Self-Study Report
on Admissions, Financial Aid, and
Academic Services.

The discussion was prefaced by a
showing of the University’s new Ad-
mission film strip. The 35 mm color
film, prepared by Guidance Asso-
ciates of New York, is designed to
augment the student recruiting pro-
gram. Commenting on the film, Ad-
mission Director James Farrar stated
the film compares very favorably
with those distributed by Princeton,
Trinty, and other comparable uni-
versities.

Initial discussion was concerned
with the possible initiation of a five-
day class week at W&L. Self-Study
Analyst Phillips stated that the fae-
ulty generally views such a propos-
al favorably. However, he pointed
out that a recent student referen-
dum favored the present system.

Student Body President, Fred Min-
del, expressed the opinion that the
EC viewed the poll as an insufficient
indication of popular student senti-
ment regarding the proposed five-
day week. He stated that the EC
plans to submit a more comprehen-
sive referendum in February which
hopefully will better reflect student
Opinion

Concerning a possible liberalized
schedule, Dr. Phillips
the several disadvant-
ages increased flexibility would im-
pose. He felt that such a change
would not only prove inordinately
inconvenient for faculty members,
but would also tend to “push” un-
necessarily the Honor System.

In an answer to a suggestion that

examination
pointed out

first semester classes terminate be-
fore Christmas vacation, Phillips
stated that under such a system,

classes would have to begin in late
August. Freshman Camp registra-
tion would be pushed back corres-
pondingly. Such a schedule, Phillips
indicated, would conflict with sum-
mer schools in other colleges and
with summer employment of both
the faculty and students

The topic of Financial Aid prompt-
ed several questions concerning the
University’s taking advantage of
available federal funds. Dean Lewis
John, Director of Financial Aid ex-
plained that Washington and Lee
plans to participate in such programs

Plaque Raced
In Law School
By Young GOP

By RANDALL WEILL
Assistant Editor

Last Saturday in the Moot Court
Room of Tucker Hall, a memorial
plaque was dedicated in honor of
Clarence J. Brown, senior congress-
man from Ohio, who attended Wash-
ington and Lee Law School.

Donald O’Sullivan, a law student,
presented the plaque to Dean Light.
O’Sullivan was the chairman of this
Young Republican Club Activity,

The plaque reads: In memory of
Clarence J. Brown, 1893-1965, class
of 1916, district member of Congress
27 years. Presented by the Law
School Young Republican Club.
The plaque will be placed on the
wall of the Moot Court Room.

The late congressman’s son, Clar-
ence J. Brown, Jr., then offered a
few remarks. He commented on his
father’s pride tn Washington and
Lee and gratefully accepted the hon-
or on behalf of the Brown family.

Brown Replaces Father

Brown was elected to replace his
father in Congress. In an active cam-
paign he defeated seven other can-
didates for the office. He was even
aided in his campaign by L. Mendel
Rivers, Democratic Congressman
from South Carolina, and chairman
of the House Armed Forces Commit-
tee.

This was Brown's first visit to
Washington and Lee, and he was on
his way to Washington to be sworn
in, Ofter officially taking office yes-
terday, he assumed his father’s old
duties, among them service on the
House Armed Forces Committee.

The Clarence J. Brown Young Re-
publieans Club in the Law School
is one of two at Washington and
Lee. The undergraduate school has
its own Young Republicans Club,
totally independent from the Law
School.

The undergraduate club is the
largest in Virginia with over 300
members. Its president is Roger Wal-
lace, a junior from Texas. Interme-
diate Law student Ray Lajuenesse

heads the Law School club.

WEL ROTC
Plan To Recruit
Seniors For OCS

By SCOTT SNOWDEN

A program to recruit seniors for
the Officer Candidate School of the
Army is being instituted by the
ROIC department, it has been an-
nounced. This program is _ being
stressed by the Department of the
Army, as a result of the expansion
of the Army which is now under-
way, since an immediate increase in
requirements for junior officers has
occurred. To fill this need, it is nec-
essary to enlarge the present pro-
gram.

Self-Interest

The Department of the Army has
requested that it be stressed that
due to his continuing vulnerability
for military service, the prospective
applicant would find it in his own
self-interest as well as in the nation-
al interest to take advantage of the
opportunity to serve in an officer's
capacity.

Men accepted to this program must
complete Basic Combat Training,
Advanced Individual Training, and
then complete approximately 23
weeks of OCS training. In total, ap-
proximately 41 to 42 weeks are re-
quired before commissioning.

Brownley Coordinates

Students interested in the Officer
Candidate Program may obtain fur-
ther information from Col. Brown-
ley of the ROTC Department.

The Department of the Army,
while encouraging as many seniors
as possible to take the OCS option
program, emphasized that it is an
arduous program that 25 per cent of
the candidates do not complete.
The Army's 1966 recruitment goal
for this program is 2360.

Notice

Any persons having letters, man-
useripts, or other personal mem-
orabilia of the late John A. Graham
are requested to contact Professor
Robert Stewart of the Washington
and Lee Music Department. A col-
lection of Graham's works and writ-
ings are being assembled by the
University.

Semester tickets will be on
at each performance. Tickets
to run $5.00 except for students
who bought a first semester pass.
Tickets for these students are avail-
able for $3.00.

Eight films are on the agenda and

Speech Unannounced

President Cole will give a short
address to the University on as yet
an unannounced topic. In the past
the talk has dealt with some aspect
of the history of the University.

This special assembly has long
been an integral part of Washington
and Lee life. The celebration of
Robert E. Lee’s birthday has been
designated Founder’s Day for the
University.

Students are reminded that the
special assembly will replace the
normal exam schedule. Examinations
will begin again on Thursday morn-
ing at nine. The faculty will wear
academic gowns.

Colonel John May

memorial wreath in the Chapel, and
Colonel May will make brief re-
marks.

Colonel May has invited members
of the Washington and Lee student
body and faculty to attend the short
ceremony if they so desire.

Colonel May and his associates will
attend the noon University Assem-
bly in Doremus Gymnasium.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Tuesday Edition

New Too Late

Approximately one year following the announcement of
the University to renovate the old Co-op, work has finally be-
gun on the long vacant building. Early yesterday morning work
crews began to set up the necessary equipment for the
$100,000 construction and renovation project scheduled for
completion in late spring.

We are particularly pleased with the prospect of a first-rate
campus book store which will hopefully eliminate the inade-
quate facilities now available. The book shop should provide
a wide variety of paperbacks at a reasonable cost if the tradi-
tional nature of a university cooperative store is maintained.
Unfortunately, the pricing policies of our present book store
as well as its appalling gaps leave much to be desired.

In a university which demands academic excellence it is
somewhat inconsistent not to provide the basic essentials—a
creditable book store for one. Granted that our library is hope-
lessly behind in the acquisition of current fiction and non-fic-
tional material, nevertheless, the paperback revolution in pub-
lishing provides an easy solution to this dilemma. If the Uni-
versity follows through with its intention to establish a “greatly
enlarged book shop,” it must guarantee optimum economic
advantages to the already financially overburdened college stu-
dent.

We are convinced that some sound financial policy can be
arranged so that students may purchase required or parallel
material at a minimum cost. Certainly much of the value of this
new addition will be lost if students are faced with the usual
commercial prices. Although this subject has been explored be-
fore, the Administration has not at this time given any indica-
tion of a new policy in the book store if, indeed, there is one.

We should like to cite the example of the co-op’s found in
a number of institutions in the Northeast where a workable
system is now in operation. We would suggest that the Uni
versity investigate the practical application of a similar system
if it has not already done so. In any event the institution of
extensive resources with existing pricing policies will represent
only partial improvement.

Slog: Sophisticated, Suave Senior
Reflects On Return Of Whole Man

By BERT PHILLIPS remarks as “the column bit it,” but

Slog is the guy with whom I live} 0 more,
in Lexington. Perhaps you know
Slog and walk with him through

 

 

It’s hard to be condescending and
energetic at the same time; thus,

 

 

the colonnade of our august and mel-
low university.

It's the phrase, “august and mel-
low,” which provokes my articula-
tion. For it’s Slog’s wording.

Sunday night he remarked in
passing through my room that the
article, “Death of the W
& Lee Man,” as Slog called it, by
columnist RideHer, “bit it.” (With
others he would have used an
euphemism, if he spoke at all, for
Slog is rather a gentleman.) He
also told me, for | walked inte his
room, that he would respond in
the Ring-tum Phi. But, ahh, the
papers he had to write....

Knowing Slog as I do, I feel that
a few years ago he would have re-
plied, read his masterpiece to me,
laughed nervously, typed it, given it
to the editor, then proofread the
copy before lunch on Tuesday. He
would have waited anxiously, though
nonchalantly, at supper. If no re-
marks were forthcoming, he would
have attempted to ellicit response.
Partially from curiosity, mainly from
egotism he would = ask...you
know “What-do-you-think-
about-this type type question.

But sieg has passed, in a period
of two years, from the folly of
adolescense to the wisdom of the
middle age. As a senior, he no
longer replies to columns. If not
peace, a profound boredom has
come ever him which only allows

 

With the exam period beginning
next Monday, the Executive Com-
mittee wishes to remind the stu-
dent body of its responsibility re-
garding the Honor System. We say
this particularly to the freshmen,
who have never experienced the
rigors of college final examinations
The next two weeks are probably
the most important in the semester,
consequently the pressure to do well
should be great. With this increased
pressure and tension inevitably goes
an inereased challenge to the Honor
System, as evidenced by the fact
that each vear, the number of Honor
cages that come before the Execu-
Committee during the exam
period are greater than at any other
me during the year

The Honor System has functioned
elatively well so far this vear. and

and discipline of the students. Per-
aps it might do well for all of us
io reflect hack upon this,

 

NOTICE

 

to insure |

unless I tell you what we talked
about, it will go unsaid. Not that it
really matters, I suppose.

Slog said the problem with his
writing a response to Mr. Ride Hers
column would be, along with his
school work, too much for his ever-
whelming laziness to bear. Too much
worry about being clever and using
suitable parallel style structure to
parellel (he loves puns) such pro-
vocative, or prevoking, paragraphs
as:

“Today's University is no long-
er concerned with the develop-
ment of the whele man. Gone are
the men in the college adminis-
tration and the professors who val-
ued the creative tradition of the
University, whe sought to share
with the younger men an under-
standing of an honorable way of
life. Today's men simply do their
jobs and they do their jobs well
as administrators and academic
teachers—but they do not bother
about the quality of life, the quali-
ty of the individual, at this Uni-
versity (sice).”

Today Slog, sitting in his room in
his chair in his underwear, is not
aware of or concerned with the de-
velopment of the whole man. Gone is
the sophomore era in which he felt
a “whole man” wasn't such an ab-
surd thing, such an oiled cliche it
would roll down the Lee Chapel hill,

that the proper perspective is main-
tained, Exams are important and
final grades are important, but
neither even remotely approaches
the importance of our responsibility
to the Honor System. The majority
of the violations of the Honor Sys-
tem seem to be “spontaneous lapses
of perspective.” which might very
well have been avoided with a little
reflection ahead of time.

The Executive Commitiee by no
means feels that it is necessary to
“warn” the student body of thei
responsibility. Almost without ex-
ception, it ia hot even necessary to
remind, especially to those who have
already experienced an exam period
Rather, this statement is written in
the hope that, should the pressure
on one single student become ex-
tremely intense, this additional re-
flection will keep his highest re-
sponsibility in its proper perspective

Lee Favors Organization

 

By BOB LEE

In some weeks to come, the stu-
dent body will be subjected to num-
erous articles ap-
pearing in this
paper enumerat-
ing both the ad-
vantages and dis-
advantages of our
joining the Na-
tional Student As-
sociation. Many of
these articles and
letters will be ad
hominum —argu-
ments urging the
student body to
reject membership because of some
of the political views attributed to
the national convention of N. S. A.
They will doubtlessly allude to some
of the more “extreme” policy pro-
nouncements of this organization and
subtly suggest that only by reject-

 

ing membership in N. S. A. ean we
properly “articulate” our dissent of
these views. They will ignore alto-
gether. as one might expect, the pal-
pably beneficial services this organ-
ization can render this University.
The style of their attack, so well
disguised, will be in keeping with
the traditions of those organizations
which will be its principle sponsors.
Their rhetoric often marred by dis-
tortion, over-simplification and in-
nuendo, will befit their intellectu-
ality. Their attack will reveal that
sickening fear that typifies similar
groups through this country which
conjure up a suspicious and cor-
rosive hatred for all ideas and in-
stitutions which, because of their
unorthodoxy or complexity, elude
their simple bigoted minds.
Criticisms Listed

But to do justice to these groups,

Birthday-Founders Day Convoca-
tion. If the speech delivered at this
assembly follows in the tradition of
past assembly speeches, we will hear
some minor event in the life of Rob-
ert E. Lee. The incident described
will be almost totally unrelated to
modern life. Such a speech will not
be unusual at Washington and Lee.
In my previous three years at the
University, I have heard speeches
either void of profound or novel
ideas or bloated with soon forgotten
plans for the future. (The book store,
promised over three semesters ago,
is still in the planning stages.)

The University Assembies pre-
sent the few opportunities for ma-
jor addresses by the Administra-
stration of Washington and Lee.
Reflective and speculative thought
concerning education, universities
in the United States, and Washing -
ton and Lee could be of benefit to
all. The Lee College proposal dealt
only with a quantitative measure.
There has been almost ne mention
of the qualitative aspects of educa-
tion,

Admiitedly Washington and Lee is
not in the throes of the problems
suffered by the multiversities. We
have no tenure protests or free
speech movements, and this is prob-
ably to our credit. But we would
be naive to assume our university is
perfect as it stands. Why is it that
as James Bryant Conant said,
“American Higher Edueation has
many virtues, but it is net charac-
ized by candor”?

The University Assemblies could
be used as more than a means for
the Registrar's Office to determine
what students are no longer at-
tending Washington and Lee. One
would assume they could serve as
forums for educators concerned
with the trends of education in our
society. Such concern is in evi-
dence elsewhere.

In November 1965, the Atlantic
Monthly devoted a special section to
“The Troubled Campus.” Articles
in that issue dealt with the hiring
and promotion
sources of student unrest, “Beleag-
ured Professors” and “The Plight of
the Small College” This last article

Obviously there are many sig-
nificant and controversial issues alive
in the nation’s universities. I am dis-
turbed to think that at Wash-
ington and Lee these issues are
closed, or that the Administration
has nothing to say.

Note: It would be a pleasure to be
proved wrong next Wednesday.

 

 

ciprocate, let us examine their argu-
ments. In a recent letter to the
Ring-tum Phi, one of their spokes-
men suggested that Washington and
Lee should not join N. S. A. because
the national convention of the or-
ganization has: 1) Urged the aboli-
tion of the House Un-American
Activities Committee; 2) condemned
American intervention in the Do-
minican Republic; 3) urged the ces-
sation of the bombing of North Viet
Nam and unconditional negotiation;
4) criticized the American college
fraternity system; 5) urged the ad-
mission of Red China into the United
Nations and 6) urged unilateral dis-
armament. I might humbly suggest
that the national convention of N.
S. A. has never proposed unilater-
al disarmament. It has. however,
adopted the other resolutions.

It is remarkable that out of the in-
numerable policies this group has
advocated, only mention of the afore-
mentioned was made. The organiza-
tion has been unequivocal in its con-
sistent advocacy of such seditious
principles as equal opportunity for
all Americans and equal protection
of the law. Since the letter’s author
so meticulously avoids mention of
these and similar proposals, I assume
he substantially agrees with them.
The dynamic aspect of our system of

 

Tyler Sees Solution To A

NSA’s Benefits Too Great to Pass Up

government is its allowance for dis-
agreement and debate. On any ques-
tion of policy, honest and intelligent
men will differ, and no man will
agree with all the policies of any of
the organizations of which he is a
member. Are we being asked to sac-
rifice the benefits this organization
can provide because we may disagree
with some of their political ideas?

What disturbs me most is the im-
plication that should Washington and
Lee join N. S. A., it would be asso-
ciated with or “stigmatized” by those
proposals of which the majority of
the student body disapproved. This
is wholly untrue. The national con-
ventions provides for the preparation
of minority reports on those ques-
tions on which a significant number
of schools disapprove. Thus, should
the student body of Washington and
Lee disapprove of policy statements
by the organization, its representa-
tives can make their dissent patently
clear by suscribing to the minority
report. We are not in any way
held to support the majority opin-
ion.

Advantages Given

But the political declarations of
the national convention of the N. S.
A. are not the reason why the
Executive Committee has considered

In Independent Study Program

By ROY TYLER

While glancing through last Fri-
day’s edition of the Ring-tum Phi,
two seemingly unrelated articles
caught my eve. One was written by
Jim Awad concerning a proposed
independent study program, while
the other was written by Bruce
Rider concerning the lack of what
Rider terms “... the Washington and
Lee man.”

A solution?

I am not convinced, as Mr. Rider
is, that the “Washington and Lee
man” is gone from the Lexington
scene. This is, however, true to some
degree. I do not feel that there is
any sure-fire way to solve the prob-
lem, but such proposals as the one
Mr. Awad has brought forth might
be a start.

It appears that the problem that
Mr. Rider has called to our atten-
tion, that of how, as students we could
take more pride in our school, could
be solved by giving those who feel
that they have nothing of which to
be proud, something to make them
change their minds.

Same Old Apathy

Much of the criticism leveled at
W&L by those who go to school here
is directly concerned, or can be re-
lated to, the apathy, disinterest, or
downright laziness of the student
body in general. The simple solution
would be to give the students of
W&L something to demand their in-
terest beyond the fifteen or so hours

 

of classes each person attends dur-
ing the week. A good start would
be the independent study program
proposed by Mr. Awad.

One thing, however, comes to mind
when most people mention indepen-
dent study... vacation. One month to
ski, take trips, etc....and then re-
turn two or three days before your
project is due and grind out some
pitiful excuse for an independent
study project and hand it in... or
perhaps not hand it in at all.

Minimum Standards

I think that the system now in
effect at Colgate to which Mr. Awad
calls attendtion in his article, would
be one of the best ways to begin
the program at Washington and Lee.
Assuredly there would be a necessi-
ty for making some minimum re-
quirement in the program, and the
issuing of grades which really meant
something.

If each student is required to turn
in a certain quality project (“pass-
ing,” “failing,” or “honors,” as in Mr.
Awad’s proposal), there might be
a little more interest taken in the
program than if the student were en-
tirely free to do as he pleased and
produce what he wished.

Interest Based

The entire program is built on in-
terest, which, some might say, would
be completely destroyed if the stu-
dent were “forced” into an indepen-
dent study program. I doubt that this

Examination Time Is

By BRUCE W. RIDER

It is now January all of a sudden,
and in less than a week we will be
plunging into final exams, the World
Series of academic life.

A goodly number of our students
who have not yet learned how to
play the academic game are getting
all tense and anxious as exam time
approaches. But we who are older
and somewhat wiser know better.

Next to Spring Vacation, exami-
nation time is the biggest holiday
the University has to offer. It is
a time to drink beer and sleep late
and drink beer and see movies and
drink beer and lay detailed plans
for Faney Dress and drink beer.
Let's face, as they say, the facts.
By the time exams come along, either
you have studied like a good little
boy or you have not. If you have
studied, exams hold no fear. And if
you haven't done your work. what
the heil-—it's too late to worry about
it now

Perhaps it would help all of us to
think about why final examinations
are given in the first place. The main
reason, to be truthful, is that exam-
imations are given because the pro-
fessors have read on page 98 in the
Catalogue that professors are sup-
posed to give final examinations

But it does take some of the
pressure off the student te know
that professors rarely grade the
things. Any man in his right mind
(or @ profesor) isn't about to
spend hour upon hour wading
through a bunch of illegible ex-
am books.

Nothing at all.

Grades are given, as we all know,
on much different standards. Seniors
majoring in the subject are given
A’s. Juniors, in the same manner,
are given B's in the course if they
are majors. The rest of the students
(who shouldn't be in there cluttering
up the class in the first place) are
given C’s. Freshmen and sophomores
are alway's given C’s because they
are freshmen and sophomores.

Why, then, ask you, perceptive
reader that you are, have any
tests at all?

Tests and quizzes are given by the

; professor during the semester for

the following reasons:

(1) The professor is going to be
out of town for a couple of days,
but he wants you to come to class
anyway. (2) They had tests when
the professor was in college (be-
fore the rise of the Medieval com-
munes) and now that he is teach-
ing, he thinks he is supposed to
give tests, too. (3) He doesn’t like
young people, and tests provide an
outlet for the professor's hostility,

Charlie Bensinger may be correct
in claiming that Chuek Stobbs holds
the record for the wildest pitch in
the history of baseball, but the most
famous wild pitches belongs to a man
who probably saw his baseball ca-
reer come to an end last season. Of
course you remember Ryne Duren
when he was the flame throwing
relief ace for the New York Yan-
kees. Duren was feared by all the
American League hitters because he
wears spectacles as thick as a volume
of Doctor Zhivago. They were afraid
that with his speed and inability to
see very well he would kill some-
one. Duren almost got one man,
whose name escapes me at the mo-
ment. The funny thing is that the
man he beaned was in the on-deck
circle. The first person to give me the
name of the man who was hit by
gets as a prize my autograph,

Do You Like Job Insecurity?

Wanted: a man who knows some-
thing about football, who is able to
get along with 240 pound monsters,
who likes to move from one job to
the next, and who likes to be booed
by at least 50,000 people at one time.
This advertisement is not paid for
by the several National Football
League teams that are looking for
coaches. This is the year for firing
and hiring of coaches. Thus far, it is
early yet, the Los Angeles Rams, the
Washington Redskins, and the Pitts-
burgh Steelers have removed last
year’s coaches. The Atlantic Falcons
have yet to have a coach. The NFL’s
newest member has at least 40 play-
ers and no coach. Maybe the Falcons
are going to try something new, like
playing an entire season without a
ce oach.

 

 

Tuesday Sports

S.

The St. Louis Cardinals may also
be in the market for a genuis to re-
place Wally Lemm. The Cardinals
matched the Minnesota Vikings as
the biggest disappointments of the
65 season.

Mike Nixon, the deposed Steeler
coach, wins the award as the bravest
man of ’65. Nixon said that he would
not quit; he would have to be fired.
And he was. Nixon was once the
head coach of the Redskins and was
replaced by Bill McPeak, who was
fired this week. There is a good
chance that Nixon will once again be

replaced by McPeak. It’s like musical }

chairs.
Same Names Every Year

It’s funny that the same names al-
ways are mentioned for the available
coaching positions. George Wilson,
who once coached the Detroit Lions
and this year was the offensive coach
of the Redskins, and Paul Brown,
well known as the coach of the
Cleveland Browns not too long ago,
are mentioned by everybody as pos-
sibilities for the vacancies .Bud Wil-
kinson, of Oklahoma fame, has had
his name crop up a few times too.
Probably none of them will get a
job.

The same thing happens in base-
ball. Every year a team looking for
a manager will be rumored to be
talking to Leo Durocher. Leo finally
made it back this year with the
Chicago Cubs. Five will get you ten
that he does not last more than two
years. Also it is a good bet that
Leo will lead the National League
managers in getting ejected from the
games, while the Cubs won't lead
the le rague in anything.

'64-'65

Win Total With Victory
Over Lynchburg Hornets

By CHARLIE FRERET

Washington and Lee’s basketball
fortunes blew hot and cold this past
weekend as they defeated Lynch-
burg Friday night by the score of
86-66, but bowed to the University
of North Carolina at Charlotte Sat-
urday night, 75-65.

Against Lynchburg, W&L dis-
played one of its best team efforts
to date as it held Lynchburg star
Wayne Proffit to a mere 17 points.
This was the second lowest point
production of the year with his
lowest, 14, against the same W&L
team in December. This is a credit to
the Generals’ defense as Profit had
scored 40 points against Randolph-
Macon Wednesday night.

He then outdid that perform-
ance Saturday by scoring 52. Lead-
ing five starters who all hit in double
figures were Rob Bauer, 29 points,
and Frank Morrison, 15 points. Bauer
played his usual outstanding game,
and Morrison, elevated to a starting
position in place of Steve Sweitzer,
continued to display good basketball
talent. Also, noteworthy was the
play of Earl Edwards, starting for the
injured Bob Spessard. Edwards
dumped in 11 points, rebounded well,
and turned in a good all around per-
formance.

It was a strong W&L team which
erased a 33-32 halftime deficit and
gradually pulled away in Lynch-
burg’s bandbox. However, Proffit
wasn’t stopped completely as late in
the game he suddenly punched Gen-
eral guard John Carrere. The par-
tisan crowd spilled onto the court
and the referees had their hands full
in preventing a riot. Order was final-
ly restored but not until one excited
fan was carried away for engaging
in some fisticuffs with one of the refs.

We Welcome Your Charge Account

This was the only time Friday night
that W&L was to come out on the
short end of a contest.

Then on Saturday night W&L took
on UNC of Charlotte, which handed
the Generals a 78-76 setback on their
home court in December. Apparent-
ly, the Generals were tired from
the night before as they were unable
to stop Lawrence and McGinty of
Charlotte as this pair scored 57 of
their teams’ 74 points.

W&L led by 3 at the nalf, 31-28.
But Charlotte came out in the sec-
ond half to take a quick 7 point
lead. The closest the Generals could
get was 3 points with a little less
than four minutes left. However,
three bad passes in succession
stymied Wé&L’s chances to catch up.
Lawrence had the hottest hand in
Charlotte’s second half comeback as
he hit 11 straight field goals and 3
foul shots for 25 points in that half.
He had a game high total of 31. Me-
Ginty followed up with 26 points.
Rob Bauer paced the General's’ of-
fense with 23 points, while Frank
Morrison chipped in with 18.

The Generals continue their home
stand this week with three games.
Tuesday pits the Generals against
RPI, Thursday finds Bridgewater
here, and Saturday Eeastern Men-
nonite plays W&L. All three games
are slated to begin at 8 with the
freshman team playing a prelimi-
nary game at 6:15 before the
Bridgewater game.

Slog Canaidlave Reture Of The Whole Man

(Continued from page 2)

and in which he felt the college
faculty sought to share with him an
understanding of an archaic “honor-
able” way of life, rather than an
understanding of the complexities of
life itself, which—honorable, dis-
honorable, or not particularly hon-
orable—do exist. Today’s Slog does
his job rather simply—and he does
his job as a student not too terribly
well—but, in his room, he does dis-
creetly bother about the quality of
life, the quality of the individual, at
this august and mellow university.

Slog’s column would have been
titled “Let Us Now Praise Disturbed
Young Men.” It would have begun
with an epigraph:

Through the columns they come,
go past,

Talking of trivia, they walk so
Sit, a0

Initially, Slog maintained, the es-
say wouldn’t have been long, since
there wasn’t too much to be praised
in the way of disturbed young men.
But his suggestions...that’s differ-
ent. They’re absolutely shocking.

He agreed with Ride Her’s point
“we students of today are much too
smart, too self-assured, too grown up
to concern ourselves with such a
useless thing as the quality of uni-
versities;” but the implied rationale
of the increasing academic orienta-
tion whisking away the “quality of
the University,” he felt was, to use
his phrase, “slightly boring.”

Let’s face it, he said. Not too rue-
fully either. This Washington & Lee
gentleman, if he ever did exist,
dosen't now, et tant pis.

Slog wondered if the Washington
& Lee gentleman got his hair cut
at the Hotel, ate meatball sand-
wiches at the College Inn, bought
beer at the East Lexington Grocery
had coffee at Doc’s and knew he
could buy’em at the bus station.
He wondered if this lost whole man
listened to Mozart and read Goethe
at the same time to calm down af-
ter a hard statistics problem,
whether on Saturday night he
shucked his racoon coat at the
gymnasium door and danced the
W&L Swing till two o'clock in the
morning with some lost whole girl
from Hollins...

Slog sees the problem as this.

Lee, he has already been assualted
by the $5,000 worth of pamplets is-
sued by the fraternities during the
summer. A week after he gets here,
he has become, not just a W&L man,
but a “bratha” as well, on his way
to being a well-rounded-Washing-
ton-Lee-gentle-fraternity-man. It
works quite smoothly: those few
other brathas—sophomores who skip
rush dates, to drink the house’s beer
in a car, seniors who've “had it,”
and the few football players who
miss rush dates are covered for by
a whole lot of other quasi-whole men
in a dark basement throbbing with
rock n’ roll, that balm of college
life; and shortly, provided there
seems to be a distinct possibility of
the rushee becoming a whole man
himself, they catch a hold of him
by his rep tie, lead him upstairs, and
suavely deliver the bid with all the
psychological wisdom of a_ high
school football coach they remember
from once so long ago.

Thus, the new man is safe, To
be involved is to be absolved.
Slog’s argument, follows, quite
rashly: the freshman shouldn't step
foot into a fraternity house, or be
able to drive a car, until after his
first semester. Slog agrees he would
hurt some. But is this so bad? he
asks. Maybe if he was lonely, he’d
think. And there should be an aca-

 

(Continued from page 2) |
membership. We have because this

demic course, Slog said, that would
force him to think even if he didn’t
want to, since, usually, he hadn't
ever before. It would be an English
course in which there were no books,
only papers. Three a week, one each
class period. And the papers would
provoke him, cajole him, ask him,
force him to think about himself—his
past, his future, his likes, his dis-
likes. It would ask him to attempt
to make connections; it would ask
why? why? why? when the only
answer was seemingly because, be-
cause, because; but because just
wouldn’t do.

And he would suffer, yes. He
would be confused, yes. He would
go down those grey shady paths
and yes, he would wish they were
black or white, yes. It would be
painful, this contrived-but-not-too-
contrived apparatus to make him

ask that flea-bitten question, “Who
am I?” Could he stop asking un-
til he had a glimpse of the truth?
Slog summed up quite philosophi-
cally while he smoked in bed. The
University would return. Perhaps it
would want its inmates to love it
rather than to love one another.
Somehow, I felt vaguely offended
by Slog. His way seemed radical.
But, then, Ride Her’s way came
off rather reactionary. There
must be some less painful way.

Frosh Basketball
Team Wins Over
Lynchburg

By DAVID DOLLAR
Last Friday night’s freshman
basketball game proved to be ex-
tremely close for the Brigadiers. The
baby Generals won a 63-62 cliff-
hanger.

The Lynchburg College Hornets
enjoyed a four-point lead at half-
time, but W&L’s freshmen came
back strong to eke out their second
victory of the season.

The difference in the game was
decided at the free throw line. Al-
though both teams dropped in 26
field goals, the Brigadiers sunk
eleven [ree shots to ten for the Hor-
nets.

Larry Boetsch led the Brigadiers
in scoring with 17 points, but he

Traditional Ball
Threatened By

Low Attendance

By MAURICE FLIESS
Executive Editor
Fancy Dress, after a long
and distinguished history as the
South’s outstanding collegiate
social event, may be going to
the dogs.

The _ traditional
break weekend will remain, un-
doubtedly, but administration and
university dance board personnel are
saying the future of the ball itself
may depend upon attendance at
tonight’s 59th annual dance.

They are watching the situation
closely, on two fronts.

One will be Evans Hall, where
since 1962 the dance has been held.
The second will be the Moose Lodge,
where a combo party is being spon-
sored by a law student and 1965
graduate of Washington and Lee.

The two functions conflict time-
wise.

There have been off-campus par-
ties on the Friday night of Fancy
Dress in years past, but none so
widely advertised as tonight's.

semester

Some associated with Fancy Dress
fear that a number of students after
learning of the $3-per-couple combo
party where drinking is allowed may
have decided against paying twice
that much for rented costumes to
wear to the ball tonight, where
drinking is not permitted.

Others, Fancy Dress vice presi-
dents and dance board members
among them, believe the usual 500
or so couples will crowd the floor
in Evans Hall tonight from 9 to 1
to dance to the music of Stan Rubin's
Orchestra

In recent years, university -spon-
sored dances have pulled a disap-
pearing act.

The Friday dance of Springs has
been converted into a concert to
match the Saturday concert.

Rufus Thomas
Entertains At
Cocktail Party

The 59th annual Fancy
Dress Weekend officially be-
gins this afternoon with the
university cocktail party at
“Walking the
Dog” Rufus Thomas and his
combo will entertain students
and their dates, as they sip
mint juleps.

Rufus Thomas, Nashville disk-
jockey, is the originator of the “dog”
and was propelled to fame with hit
songs like “The Dog,” “Walking the
Dog,” “Can Your Monkey do the
Dog,” and “Jump Back.”

The Fancy Dress Ball itself starts
tonight at nine, with President Joe
Miller and his escort leading the fig-
ure on the floor of Evans Dining
Hall. Following Miller will be vice-
presidents Tersh Baker, John An-
thony, Scott Miller, John Ruther-
ford, Larry Craig, Jeff Novinger, and
Roy Tyler. Also in the figure will
be the eighteen fraternity presidents
and the president of the Dance
Board.

At 9:40, Stan Rubin and his Or-
chestra will strike up dance music,
and the ball will be underway. Stu-
dents and their dates will be in for-
mal attire, or wearing costumes ap-
propriate to the “Derby Day” theme
of the ball. Costumes will include
jockeys, gamblers, Kentucky colo-
nels, and Southern gentlemen

Stan Rubin, returning to W&L
alter last year’s performance at
Fancy Dress, leads one of the most
successful dance bands in the coun-
try. His two-in-one combination of
orchestra and Tigertown Five is
heavily sought after for college func-
tions, cotillions, and debutante par-
ties.

Friday Edition

| The Best Laid Plans...

’Tis the end of exams... the season of Fancy Dress. And
how do we find the average Washington and Lee gentleman?
Besides being “crude” and “slovenly” as the Wahoos see him,

he is alone, all alone, ‘‘an Iland, intire of it selfe.”’

Planning for this fifty-ninth Fancy Dress weekend began
early in the fall as President Joe Miller and the Dance Board
scheduled a great variety of entertainment suited to the tastes
of all W&L students. Slated to appear are Rufus Thomas in
the pop-r&b field, Stan Rubin, a perennial Dance Board favor-
ite, for the Dixieland fans, Ian and Sylvia, the best of folk, and
Nina Simone, jazz stylist extraordinaire.

To do their part W&L students always try to come up
with particularly good dates. Therefore, out came the black
book for western Virginia’s Fast Moving Five.

As good planning would have it, Hollins and Sweet Briar,
the second homes of the “stud,’”’ conveniently scheduled their
exams to conflict with “the South’s outstanding collegiate
social event.”

Curfew hours for Sem girls have been liberalized for W&L
big weekends, but Sem is still Sem. Three down.

The intellectual Mink likes to feel smarter than his date.
Scratch Macon; four down.

And what self-respecting W&L “hoss” wants to date “‘the
girl next door” for Fancy Dress? Exit Mary Baldwin.

Local talent being what it is, obvious choice becomes the
girl back home. But unfortunately, that is where she still is.

She is still there because Old Man Winter is ‘dumping’

degree. Woodrum Field looks more like the Homestead every
hour, and even the bears won’t come out of Weyer’s Cave.

But the weekend offers too much to punt completely, so,
instead of finessing it, have a ball, even if snow cones must re-
place mint juleps as drink-of-the-week.

A Midwinter Night's Dream

 

Mrs. Miller Sets Fancy Dress Spirit
With Professional Dance Decorations

Washington and Lee students will
have professional help—free for
nothing—in designing the decorations
for their 57th annual Fancy Dress
Ball Friday night.

The students were assured of that
last year when they elected senior
Joseph G. Miller of Nashville, Tenn.,
as Fancy Dress President. Miller’s
mother, Mrs. W. F. Miller, is a pro-
fessional set designer, working with
both the Children’s Theater and the
Circle Theater in Nashville.

Mrs. Miller recently spent several
days in Lexington looking over
Evans Dining Hall, where the Ball-
one of the South’s oldest and lead-
ing social events—will be held, and
in helping her son and members of
his committee design the dance dec-
orations.

The theme is “Derby Day,” and
every effort has been made to capture
an authentic reproduction of the
Kentucky Derby. Miller and several

snow on our rustic setting to an unprecedented and intolerable Editor and FD Committee)

Gentlemen:

I was somewhat taken back to read
Mr. Cannon’s editorial concerning
ipathy toward Fancy Dress Weekend
in the January 7, 1966, issue of the

| Ring-tum Phi. Obviously, Mr. Can-

non or whoever wrote the editorial
did not attend Fancy Dress himself
year, or he would not have
made the not so astute statements
which he made concerning this year’s
lag in enthusiasm.

Last year, around 250 costumes
were sold and over 100 more impro-
vised, providing for a very high
turnout for recent years. Studdism
and snobbery apparently didn’t inhi-
bit the turnout at all—conversely,
that faction was well represented
at the 1965 Fancy Dress Ball. This
in itself refutes the editor’s thesis
that W&L students are fearing for
their “stud image rating” by going
to the traditional FD ball

I think that an important
for this year’s apathy, which in this
instance appears to be a real prob-
lem, is that via this year’s selection
of Vice-Presidents for the Weekend,
Fancy Dress appears to be a Delta
Tau Delta function rather than a
and Lee University
function. This struck me as soon as
I read the issue announcing that 6
of the 8 VP's were selected from one
fraternity

On the other hand, the VP's for the
1965 Fancy Dress Weekend repre-
sented four different fraternities and
the Non-Fraternity Union, Could this
difference? I think

Sincerely,

DICK KREITLER,

Editor's Note: Never let it be
said that Dick Kreitler ever threw
a party for anybody but studs, It
would ruin his image.

With this, Mrs. Miller has created
a 30 by 17-foot three-dimension ir-
regular oval which will surround the
bandstand and simulate the Derby
track, complete with a seven-foot
high horse and jockey, finish line,
fence and 11-foot Gold Cup. =

In addition, huge banners in the

scheme, tiled floor and grandiose
brass and crystal chandeliers, is in
itself a magnificent setting for the
Ball.

“The dining hall is just beautiful,”
Mrs. Miller said, “and really needs
little additional decoration anyway.”

One drawback which had to be
overcome: Because the Ball is in a
dining hall, none of the decorations
could be nailed or pasted to the
walls, floor or ceiling. Mrs. Miller
simply designed a large framework
of two-by-fours which will serve as
the bandstand and to which the dec-
orations can be attached.

 

The framework can be reused for
future Fancy Dress Balls.

Costumes for the Derby Day Ball
will include jockey suits, gambler’s

outfits, Kentucky Colonels and
Southern gentlemen topped off by
silk hats and bowlers. University
students will wear the costumes.

Their dates will wear formal dresses.

President Miller and the 26 student
officers of the dance will be decked
out in white tie and tails. They will
lead the figure which gets the Ball
underway at 9 p.m. Miller will es-
cort Miss Sandra Shelton of Nash-
ville, a student at Vanderbilt.

Campus Memories, Musings, Predictions

By KAZ HERCHOLD
Assistant Managing Editor

As another semester comes to its
tearful end, let's reflect for a mo-
ment upon all the people and event

who shook, nauseated, bored, or
irked that much maligned mass of
humanity known as the W&L stu-
dent body.

First there were the campus pun-
dits whose cogent and unerringly

perceptive additions to the arsenal of
student philosophy served only to
fill pages of the Ring-tum Phi and
then perhaps to illuminate the dark
their own minds
Why, week after week, someone else

Clark and his
boys, better
known as the “Hot
Nuts.”

It has been a
long time since this famous, or in-
famous, group has been around W&L
and what a weekend to return! Just
once before I die I'd like to see a
Fancy Dress without snow, a Fancy
Dress costume without galoshes, a
Fancy Dress ball without a snow-
ball.

Would you believe that it has
snowed for the last 20 Fancy Dress-
es? Well, would you believe the
last 7? You had better, because that’s
what it is.

The fly boys are already planning
to schedule a shut down of the air-
ports during next year’s F.D. for
an extra holiday. All they'll need
is someone to tend the phone and
say, “sorry, but there just ain’t noth-
in’ comin’ or goin’” in a thick Ap-
palachian accent. They already know
that it will snow.

I'm beginning to think that the
weatherman is a Wahoo. Why else
does it snow for, or rather on, us
and not on them? Somebody some-
where is plotting to keep good W&L
men from their dates, and they've
made a damn good start.

Inside joke of the week—the ru-
mor that Paul Brown would be

the next coach of the Washington
Redskins. What is so funny that his
old quarterback, Otto Graham, got
the job. If Brown won't do, maybe
an ex-Brown will.

If Otto is half as good a pro coach
as he was a pro QB, the rest of the
league had better look out; the Skins
could finish up where they're pick-
ed one of these years.

Bridgewater
Tops Brigadiers

The first game of the season saw
the Washington and Lee freshman
basketball team lose to Bridgewater
by a 70-45 score, but in the week
before exams the Little Generals
kept it close before finally falling 71-
62.

Larry Boetsch was the high scorer
for the freshman team with 16 points.
Lee McMillan, Greg Crampton, and
Richard Lohrman followed with 9
points each.

As Coach Joe Lyles put it, “There
has been vast improvement made.
But the trouble remains in the prac-
tices. There are only ten boys on the
team, and an average of three or
four have labs each day. As a result,
we can’t work on defense or presses,
or even pattern basketball to any
great extent. Our floor play, which
is the key to a winning team, has
suffered greatly.”

NOTICE

Coach Norris Eastman has an-
nounced that his swimming team will
hold practice at 12:30 p.m. on Sun-

 

day.

ars and their research efforts with
the magnitude, extent and depth of
its holdings. And professors contin-
ued to assign the same paper topics
to groups of at least thirty students,
gleefully insuring that the book rush
at McCormick would resemble naval
maneuvers in Death Valley. The
novel, a yet undiscovered literary
form at McCormick, never did quite
make the shelves. But then again,
reading hasn’t quite made the Wash-
ington and Lee gentleman’s extra-
academic hit parade either. The li-
brary staff, though, did decorate
the interior very nicely for Christ-
mas, stretching the horizons of the
aesthetic sense, capturing a little bit
of Christmas away from home for
the boys. Even that went largely un-
noticed.

The P.E. department, giving the lie
to extant rumors which questioned
its reality, defied established systems
of logic, positing its very own an-
swers to the burning issues of stu-
dent life. Yes, badminton was still a
prerequisite for handball, for who
after all could play handball without
knowing how to play badminton?
Well, the argument, which runs

tion that spastic segment of the stu-
dent body which never recovered
from last year’s P.F.I. tests. And then
to add to all the headaches at Dore-
mus, there was the football season.
The student body ought, neverthe-
less, to be commended for the re-
markable restraint with which it kept
a grip on the frustration of support-
ing only a partially successful team.
And the basketball team finally
showed signs of all the potential it
was reputed to possess, battling with
nationally ranked powers such as
David Lipscomb, Eastern Mennonite,

 

and Bridgewater.

Finally, the campus’ stimulating |
political life reached new heights of |
enlightenment as the Young Ameri- |
cans for Freedom surfaced from the |
depths of an enterprising young re-
actionary’s mind, to burst full blown
in the face of W&L’s already open-
minded brand of political activist.

Upperman and Ellis led Bridgewater

hit 42.5 per cent from the field. The
Generals, led by Kline with 14 points
and Bauer and Edwards with 11, hit
on 45.8 per cent of their shots, but
the big difference was Bridgewater's

Rubin, Simone, Ian and Sylvia Highlight Fancy Dress

(Continued from page 1)
Fancy Dress will be significantly
altered, perhaps as soon as next year.

It all began in 1907 when Miss
Annie Jo White, the W&L librarian,
gave a costume party for her friends
in a room above McCrum’s Drug
Store. Students turned the private
party into a campus-wide function,
with Miss Annie directing each ball
until 1920 and attending each until
her death in 1938.

Featured twice in Life magazine,
and broadcast by the CBS radio net-

work in the past, Fancy Dress re-
ceived national recognition through
the years for the pageantry of such
themes as the Congress of Vienna
Ball, Arabian Nights, Sherwood For-
est, Shakespeare in the Court of
King James I, Mardi Gras, Civil War
Centennial, and—in 1965—Showboat.

In 1940, the theme was much like
this year’s “Derby Day.” It was an
authentic reproduction of the first
Kentucky Derby party in the gar-
dens of Federal Hill at Louisville in

 

1875.

73 Students
Earn 2.5, 109
Under Auto

By CHRIS MILLS

The class of 1969 stole the
spotlight in the recently an-
nounced first semester grades,
placing a record twenty men
on the Dean’s list and Honor

Roll, eligible for initiation into
Phi Eta Sigma, the freshman hon-
orary society.

A total of 73 students in the Uni-
versity made scholastic averages in
excess of 2.5 and were placed on
the Honor Roll. This figure includes
the 20 freshmen, of whom four re-
ceived all A’s, and seven straight-A
upperclassmen. Last year there were
no first year men with a perfect
average, but there was greater
number of upperclassmen with three-
point averages, a total of twelve.

Under the new University regu-
lations, a student no longer “severs
his connection with the University”
under the Automatic Rule after the
completion of an odd number of se-
mesters. In other words, he will not
be forced to leave at the end of the
fall term if he falls below certain
academic standards.

Instead, students are placed on
academic probation during the sec-
ond semester; if. at the end of that
semester, they have not met the
minimum standards required under
the provisions of their probation,
then they will be dropped from the
rolls.

The application of these new rules
has placed 109 men on academic pro-
bation. Last year, under the old
regulation, 26 men were dropped
from the rolls, but comparisons are
unfair between the two systems since
the new rules lay down more de-
manding averages which must be
met to avoid academic probation

Thirteen of the students presently
on academic probation are there due
to I's on their semester reports. If
they successfully remove these
grades of Incomplete, they may al-

a

so be removed from academic pro- |

bation

| fraternities, one including the names

of all incoming freshmen, and the
other containing only the names of
the Jewish freshmen. The practice
was begun in order to allow cer-
tain fraternities to comply with the
racial exclusion clauses of their char-
ters.

In proposing
IFC, Vice
pointed

the measure to the
President Billy Cannon
out that there has been
increasing pressure in the past years
upon the University to end the two-
list system. President Chuck Griffin
added that there had been in addi-
tion a great deal of criticism direct-
ed against fraternities in general
because exclusion clauses, and
suggested the abolition of the sepa-
rate lists would provide an oppor-
tunity to create good will

of

In addition, said Griffin, previous
law suits have established that “it’s

illegal to do what we've been do-

ing We're helping you break the
law.’
Dean Edward C. Atwood, agree-

ing with Griffin, said that while it
must be recognized that some fra-
ternities forbidden by their na-
tional organizations to pledge Jews,
“it is not the function of the Univer-
sity t exclusion

o toster clauses in
fraternities.”

Dean Atwood also announced that
the question concerning religious af-
filiation will removed from
missions application forms this yea
He explained that the information
has never been used for determining
admissions, but only for the purposes
of supplying fraternities with Jew-
ish and non-Jewish lists, and for
providing the local ministers with
lists of students of each demonina-
tion

Beginning this year, lists for min-
isters will made up from Fresh-
man Camp applications. If the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee acts affirm-
atively on the IFC's proposal, as is
expected, the separate list of Jewish

abolished altogether

THE RING-TUM PHI

_— Edition

Exit WASP

Wednesday night’s vote by the Interfraternity Council to
eliminate, at least on the surface, any discrimination between
students on the basis of religion must be lauded as a step for-
ward to achieving the true meaning of fraternal brotherhood.

The proposal, which passed 14-0-1 only after considerable
debate, recommends that the Student Affairs Committee dis-
continue the publishing of dual lists (one Jewish, one Gentile)
for rush purposes. The action simply clears the hands of the
administration and IFC from any part in condoning or per-
petuating the so-called “WASP clause” in many national fra-
ternity charters.

The debate did not revolve around the intent of the clauses
which are designed clearly to eliminate from membership any
person who is not white, anglo-saxon, and protestant, but rather
cloaked itself in a robe of self-righteousness placing the entire
blame for such clauses on the national fraternity. Questions like
“what will our national think?” “what does this mean to our
house in relation to national?”; and “we have lost good boys |
because of the clause but our by-laws... .” etc. provided the |
external basis for argument.

Operating on the assumption that it is in fact the
national, not the local, which forces the discrimination,
we feel that it is high time that W&L fraternities who
are still bound by such clauses wake up and take the
lead in getting them abolished from their national char-
ters. It should be remembered that a national fraternity
is no more, or no less, than the sum of its locals.

The WASP clause cannot be defended on any
grounds. And fraternities who find comfort operating under
labels, such as a “pure Christian organization’”’ are doing noth- |

moral

ing more than fooling themselves. A true Christian view de- |
mands the acceptance of all men into the corporate whole in|

Montgomery Returns From South Pacific;
Finds Civilization Incongruent To West

Editor’s note: Feature Editor War-
ren Montgomery has just returned
to W&L after a ten month’s cruise
aboard Columbia University’s ocean-
ographic research, R. V. Vema.
This is the first in a series of ar-

ticles on the expedition.

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Last April, while the Vema was
calling in Tahiti, I had the good luck
to a fall off my rented motor scoot-
er in Papeete,
landing in the
French provincial
hospital with an
immobilized right
leg. Ensconced
among five mag-
nificent French
nurses, I began to
make serious so-
ciological compar
isons between
W&L and Tahiti,
which, _ pertinent
are here presented.

Yes, I often thought about my
snow-bound, book-ladened ex-fel-
low-students here in Lexington. The
similarities between Tahiti and Lex-
ington are astounding—I can’t think
of any right off hand, but you can
draw your own conclusions:

This narrow ring of land is the
only habitable part of Tahiti, but it
is as lovely in its way as the moun-
tains. Very little is under cultiva-
tion, and much retains its natural
growth of coconut palms, mangoes,
bamboo, taro, ete—a lush, dense
tropical vegitation. The forests are

The island, with its lofty interior
and narrow piedmont, is surrounded
and protected on all sides by a cor-

the remnant of sea waves crashing
on the barrier from the Pacific.

age, due to western food and dis-
ease. In Papeete, the capital, they are
jrequired to wear western clothing,
| but elsewhere may wear the tradi-
tional costume—a piece of vivid
cloth, three yards by one, called a
pareu (pah-ray-oh). Women wear
it draped around the waist, like a

tucked up short, like diapers.

Grass House

| Many Tahitians still live in grass
houses, whose palm leaf roofs and
woven grass wall panels are support-
ed on frames of bamboo. I recently
saw a prominent American news
magazine call this “poverty,” one of

 

the most uninformed ideas I have
ever run across. Those Tahitians
who have managed to maintain a
grass shack existence have more in
life than most people of our socie-
ty. Tahiti is one of the few places
where, in the original civilization,
the people seem to have everything
they need or want.

Food in the original civilization of
the islands, and for those who still
have land, is provided practically
without effort. Edible fruits and veg-
etables grow everywhere; the cli-
mate is a constant 75-90 degrees.
Fish are available to anyone who
will cut a tree to build an outrig-
ger canoe. A typical Tahitian meal
(to which I was often invited by a
family I knew there) may consist
of‘ raw and cooked fish, taro root,
papaya poi (mush), bananas, and
breadfruit. Everything is dipped in
a sour coconut sauce and eaten with
the fingers.

For those who have managed to
keep the old ways—and not all Ta-
hitians have—housing, food, and
clothing are provided by nature. The
native way of life completely ful-
fills the slight requirements of the
mild South Seas environment, and
it certainly should not be classified
as poverty.

Musical Language

The Tahitian language is more mu-
sical than any I have heard before.
Tahitian words drop consonants,
stressing the vowels. For example,
there are: the district of Faaa (fa-
ah-ah), the Taharuu river (tah-hah-
roo-o0o), the island of Moorea (Moh-
oh-ray-ah), and the Faatau family
(fah-ah-tah-oh). All Tahitians still
speak their native language, and
most speak French as well.

The Tahitians are looked down
upon as lazy by their French rulers,
but this was not my impression.
Westerners characteristically apply
their standards to people whose cul-
tures allow no comparison with ours.
Hence, joyous sexuality becomes
“promiscuity,” grass-shack life be-
comes “poverty,” and a reasonable
aversion to unnecessary manual la-
bor becomes “laziness.” The truth is
that the Tahitians have no need to
work, in our sense of the word, but
can energetically pursue the joie de
vivre characteristic of Polynes-
ians. Unlike in our harsh “temper-
ate” zone, the Tahitians have no
need to struggle for existence, and
our idea of work is both virtueless
and meaningless in Polynesia.

(Next week: several customs of
the Tahitians, and threats to their
civilization.)

Fancy Dress Snow Job Causes
‘Some Pretty Weird Situations’

By CHARLIE BENSINGER

Dear Mom and Dad,

Well, I may not be able to pick
the games, but, boy, can I predict
the snow. I think
that it can be
truthfully said
that much snow
fell this Fancy
Dress, probably
both outside and
in. To those poor
guys whose dates
never got here, we
offer our condol-
ences, or congrat-
ulations as the
case may be. The
same goes for the guys whose
dates were snowed in here and had
to stay an extra day.

Needless to say, the snow set up
some pretty weird situations. Some
apartment men found their water
pipes frozen, and there just ain’t no
way to flush the john without water.
A Lexington Police Department
squad car got stuck in the snow and
had to be pushed free by W&L stu-
dents helping the town police—amaz-
ing.

And about the students who
couldn’t get back in town for Mon-
day classes? Shades of Charlie Milne!
We were just about the only col-
lege in Virginia that had classes.
That in itself may be the biggest
snow joke of the week.

Turning to a drier subject, I find
myself confronted with Intramurals.

The basketball finals have begun,
and it looks like Kappa Sig will
take the crown. In the first night
of action, Sigma Nu and Kappa Sig
were the winners, as they defeated
Phi Gam 47-17 and ZBT 42-38.

Generals Back In Action;
Here For Towson. Tonight,
Face R-M Tomorrow
By RON KESSLER

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team re-opens its season to-
night after a three week exam break,
taking on Towson College at 8
p.m. in Doremus Gym.

According to Head Coach Verne
Canfield, Towson is “one of the best
shooting teams we play. The keys
will be a good defensive effort and
strength on the boards.” Last year,
Towson defeated the Generals %
to 90 in a poorly officiated game.
“This year,” said Canfield, “it should
be one of our better games.”

Tomorrow night, the W&L five
play Randolph-Macon College, prob-
ably the best team in the state.
Coach Canfield claimed that Macon
has “five boys that look just great
and a good bench. As far as we are
concerned, all our practices are be-
ing geared toward the Towson
game.”

In general, Canfield asserted that
the team is making definite progress

Last week I picked Sigma Nu, and
now they’re on the ropes. Since I
have developed such a fantastic
trend in sports prognostication, I
have decided to turn pro. This means
that if any fraternity would like to
insure a championship, it has only
to turn in the highest bid for my

co-favorites all the other competing
teams.

Wrestlers Tackle NCS & Duke
After 29-6 Victory Over W&M

Looking back to January 12, it
seems that the Washington and Lee
varsity wrestling team defeated Wil-
liam and Mary 29-6, after losing the
first two individual matches.

Bobby Payne started the comeback
by winning a forfeit at the 137 pound
class. Co-captain Kim White then
decisioned his man, 14-3, to put W&L
ahead 8-6,

Charlie Slaughter, leading 13-2,
pinned his man with only 1:02 re-
maining in the final period. Jamie
Andrew, the other co-captain, and
Bob Munson followed up by out-
pointing their men 10-0 and 10-5,

Once again, there was a forfeit in
W&L’s favor, as Jay Clarke picked
up an easy five points. Holmes Rak-
er, the littlest heavyweight, won by
default in the first period when, with
the score 2-2, his opponent withdrew
with an injury.

The W&L J.V. wrestling team used
the same come-from-behind tactics
in defeating the Augusta Military
Academy varsity, 23-14.

After losing the first four matches,
the Generals got back on the win-
ning track when Charlie Slaughter
pinned his opponent in the excellent
time of 1:40.

Bob Munson, winner by a 6-3
score, was followed by three straight
pins. Clark Carter got his man at
2:40, Will Ridley pinned his at 5:00,
and Hugh Brougher, outweighed by
95 pounds, pinned the A.M.A. heavy-
weight at 4:45.

The William and Mary victory
brings the team’s record to 3-1, with
‘he nexi match against N.C. State on
February 8, followed by Duke the
next night. Originally these match-
es were to be on February 4 and
5, but weather conditions necessitat-
ed the postponement.

Last year the Generals defeated
both of these teams, N.C. State 23-10
and Duke 30-4. The N.C. State

match may prove closer than last

Ever wonder why you see so
many columns like this that use

these three little stars to break up
the sections? If so, and even if not,
it is simply because the writer can’t
think of a transitionary sentence.

Now that the educational note for
today has been inserted, I would
like to call attention to the beautiful
planning which characterizes our
second semester. How about the fact
that George Washington’s birthday
will be celebrated this year with
the ODK assembly for which attend-
ance seems to be required, while at
the same time New Orleans will be
celebrating Mardi Gras.

Then there is the not-so-unusual
conflict in the timing of our spring
vacation and that of every other

 

school in the nation, especially the
Fast Moving Five (note—an exag-
geration of this nature is called a
hyperbole).

And, of course, there is the won-
derful Co-op book store, the place
where the smiling ladies say, “Oh,
well that book hasn’t come in yet.”
To this the woebegotten student says,
“But I have to read the first seven-
teen chapters, all 17,386 pages, by
tomorrow for a test.”

“But no professor would make
such a large first assignment.”

“But this is for a mid-semester
test.”

“Oh!”

As a noted faculty member would
say: the prices may be high, but
the service is slow.

Sigma Chi and SPE led the fra-
ternities in placing men on the
freshman honor roll. Sigma Chi
put four and SPE three of its
pledges on the list. Three men were
independent, and two were from
PEP and two from ZBT.

These twenty men will be eligible
for initiation into Phi Eta Sigma,
the honorary society designed to
recognize scholastic excellence in
the first semester of the freshman
year. Each year, in February, a
banquet is held to honor those elect-
ed into Phi Eta Sigma.

and to insure that at each general
meeting there would be a sufficient
amount of business to be taken care
of.

The system will be tested in the
coming month on a four-week trial
basis.

Also brought up for discussion was
a proposal that house officer elec-
tions should all be held on a com-
mon date, preferably immediately
after the January semester break
each year.

The suggestion was made in order
to find a solution for the IFC's dif-
ficulty in maintaining continuity of
policy, particularly on committees.
As the system operates now, house
elections are conducted throughout
the year. The result is a constant
turnover of committee members and
the paralyzing of committee policy-
making.

A second advantage to a common
election date, said Cannon, would be
that fraternity house presidents and
treasurers could attend a_ single
workshop at the beginning of the
semester, in which all could be fa-
miliarized with their responsibilities.

Exceptions would be made in the
case of houses whose elections are
set on a specific date by their na-
tional organizations.

The proposal will be formally pro-
posed and voted on at a future meet-
ing.

The 124 freshmen actives from

same time a year ago.

Grade Trouble for 39
Thirty-nine freshmen from these

 

houses failed to meet the 1.00 grade
point ratio requirement by the Uni-
versity and fell into the “super
pledge” category.

These “super pledges” are not rec-
ognized by the national fraternity,
but they can be initiated if they
make a 1.50 at mid-semester.

Delts, Nus Successful

The Delts and the Sigma Nus had
the most success in getting pledges
to meet the grade requirement. Only
1 of 15 Delts and 2 of 18 Sigma Nus
didn’t measure up.

The 17 freshmen to be initiated by
Phi Ep represents the largest number
of freshmen to go active since 1963
when the Delts initiated 18.

Delta Upsilon, Kappa Alpha, Phi
Gam, and Phi Psis plan their initia-
tion ceremonies by the end of the
month, but only Phi Psi has set a
definite date, Feb. 19. KA hopes to
hold its initiation the wekend of
Feb. 26, but the date is not definite.
Phi Psi will have a cocktail party
in addition to the customary ban-
quet.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che King-tum Phi

Tuesday Edition

Bell, Book, And Candle

Tomorrow afternoon faculty and students will be given
an opportunity to participate in a discussion on the progress
of the Self-Study on the library. During the course of this
year we have been extremely interested in the evaluation of
our library primarily because we feel that the library is the
heart of this University. In light of the rather poor attendance
at certain other meetings concerning various aspects of the
Self-Study, particularly by students, we wish to urge faculty
and students alike to support Wednesday’s hearing enthusiastic-
ally.

 

Conflicting Interests

The Ring-tum Phi has taken a very keen interest in the
deliberations of the library committee, and we have discovered,
on occasion, dissension within this committee which necessarily
prohibited a full and dispassionate appraisal of the library’s
needs. On the other hand we noted with encouragement the
circulation of a questionnaire seeking faculty reaction to ques-
tions concerning library space, holdings, policies, and services.
We are anxiously awaiting the publication of any data related
to this survey.

Obvious Omissions

A close examination of the library summary reveals sev-
eral obvious omissions. The number and quality of volumes
presently in our library receives no attention, although we are
willing to admit that these statistics are by no means an ade-
quate measure of the excellence of our library. Nevertheless,
quantity and quality are significant aspects of the overall con-
tent of any library.

Recommendations concerning periodicals are also lacking
in the abbreviated report. The lacunae in our periodical col-
lection are the source of frustration and consternation for the
student engaged in research. Although the library is perhaps
hopelessly behind in the acquisition of scholarly journals, we
believe that some progress can and should be made in this area.

Faculty Status and Tenure?

Faculty status and eventually tenure for all professional
personnel beyond the second year of service is probably the
most surprising recommendation contained in the summary.
This statement is somewhat ambigious since there is no indica-
tion of the educational prerequisite for professional personnel.
We are opposed to tenure for library personnel based on length
of service alone. In addition, faculty status should be reserved
for the teaching and administrative members of the academic
community.

It is unfortunate that the study of the library became a
forum for venting of personal differences which on numerous
occasions thwarted the real purpose of the Self-Study. There
is, however, ample opportunity for students and faculty to
contribute meaningfully to this discussion at tomorrow's meet-
ing.

We would suggest that students familiarize themselves with
the content of the committee’s summary in order to prepare
for this important session. Copies of the report are available
in Mr. Parsons’ office on the third floor of Washington Hall.

CONTACT: A Second Chance

Except for one session of the 1965 CONTACT, participa
tion by the student body was appallingly law. Dr. James W.
Silver attracted a full-house, while the five other speakers ex-
erted themselves for the handful of persons who attended their
speeches. It was a sad commentary on both the principle of

CONTACT and the Washington and Lee Student body.
Last Year's Disappointment

The diffuse nature of last year’s theme, a nebulous and
ambiguous potpourri called “The American Experience and
Its Applications for the Individual Citizen, the American Na-
tion and the World,” was in part responsible for the uninspired
response of the students. However, this does not reduce the
blame which must be heaped on the student body as a whole.
If only out of common courtesy, for the speakers, the seats in
Lee Chapel should have been filled. If only to make use of the
money which each fraternity had to pay, the seats should have
been filled. If only to give support to a fragile but valuable
project, those seats should have been filled.

Maturation Process
CONTACT is a year older, and—hopefully—a year bet-

ter. Whether or not it has matured will be determined this
weekend on the Lee Chapel podium; whether or not the stu-
dent body has matured equally will be decided by the number
of empty seats. We think there has been maturation of both
CONTACT and the Student Body. Hopefully, many filled

seats will prove us right.

End of The IFC “Jewish List” Is Discussed

By BOB LEE

This past Tueday night, the LF.C.
was subjected to one of the most
thoroughly revolting exhibitions I
have ever witnessed. At its weekly
meeting, the ILF.C.’s_ enlightened
leadership urged its member frater-
nities to vote for the elimination of
dual lists of incoming freshmen, from
which Jewish students can be dis-
tinguished from non-Jewish stud-
ents. This represents a significant im-
provement—I wouldn’t presume to
argue otherwise—but the sincerity
with which the appeals were made
must appear somewhat suspect. Less
than one year ago, the President of
the LF.C., in defending the dual
lists, wrote the following:

Moreover, I would like to point
out that the LF.C. is not condon-
ing the perpetuation of ‘an intol-
erably hypocritical system of dis-
crimination’... Rather, it is acting
in accordance with the wishes of
a majority of the fraternities—I
believe this is called democracy. ...

It becomes a matter of which
party we chose to hurt? If we
publish a single list of the entire
freshman class, we will be doing
an injustice to those houses whose
hands are bound by such restric-
tive clauses.

Is this the same Chuck Griffin I
heard Tuesday night argue in such
eloquent and vaunted platitudes
about the injustice of seperate lists?
How times have changed!!!!

 

 

Where did all the help go?

Tuesday night we were told how
we were contributing to the violation
of the law. I would suggest that
there is a higher moral law which
was not legislated or adjudicated
just last year, but one which has
been recognized and generally ac-
cepted for a long time. Suddenly the
LF.C. has become conscious of and
concerned about the prospect of
breaking the law. Where were these
scrupples in the past when the LF.C.
blatantly broke overy moral precept
concerning discrimination? Is_ it
simply that this moral law went un-
perceived by a majority of fraterni-
ties at Washington and Lee?

How Times Have Changed

We also heard from a representa-
tive of the Administration who con-
demned not only dual lists, but the
whole concept of restrictive clauses.
He told us that it was not the Ad-
ministration nor the Admission’s Of-
fice who were responsible for the
way in which these lists had been
used in the past. The list, he said,
were drawn up simply for the con-
venience of local churches and syna-
gogues. Thus the Administration, we
are to assume, could not accept re-
sponsibility for the discrimination
arising from the publication of sep-
arate lists.

Now this is just a little hard to
swallow. If they were drawn up
simply to benefit the local ministers
and rabbis, why were they ever
made available to rush chairmen

who could use them to exclude an
otherwise anonymous group of stu-
dents from their respective fraterni-
ties. No—the Administration and Of-
fice of Admissions are more respon-
sible for whatever discrimination has
taken place than anyone else. It
has been they who over the years
divulged information, ostensibly giv-
en them in confidence, to facilitate
the discriminatory practices of cer-
tain fraternities.

They were never compelled to
comply with the wishes of the LF.C.
If they found such discrimination to
be undesirable, why did they permit
such information to be used in ways
obviously intended to promote and
foster discrimination. The Adminis-
tration and the Office of Admissions
cannot be absolved from guilt in this
matter.

So what can and ought to be done?
How can Washington and Lee simply
permit itself to be carried along in
the current sweeping American col-
lege campuses, but become a leader
in eliminating this morally regret-
table practice of discrimination by

 

fraternities? How can we now stop
paying lip service to the idea of an
“open rush system” and insure the
implementation of such a program?
Washington and Lee cannot remain
content to observe standards set by
“national fraternities,” but ought to
set their own standards to which
the nationals must conform.

We ought to insist that any frater-
nity whose national retains such a
restrictive clause must, in order to
demonstrate good faith, repudiate
such a clause or at least make a
statement that the local chapter
chooses to ignore all such clauses.
The LF.C. should likewise guaran-
tee that all channels by which fra-
ternities can ascertain the religious
affiliations of freshmen be closed
to them.

They should also bring pressure to
bear against those fraternities who
continually maintain their all-Chris-
tian composition. Lastly. the LF.C.
ought to provide leadership whose
pronouncements on the subject do
not reek of hypocrisy.

 

Nation Solicits Support
For Contact Symposium

ByMIKE NATION

The most exciting innovation at
Washington and Lee during this
columnist’s three years tenure was
the birth last year of CONTACT.

CONTACT, as conceived, is to be
an annual, except for mock conven-
tion year, intellec-
tual symposium
covering one spe-
cific topic of cur-
rent interest and
importance. Last
year’s topic was
“The American
Experience.” This
year “The City”
will be the sub-
ject for discussion.

The modern
city, the enormous
and nearly formless conglomeration
of humans in a limited area, is the
newest of all people distribution phe-
nomena. The Industrial Revolution
itself did not give rise to the city
as we know it today. It did give rise
to large masses residing in the same
area. But these groups centered
about an industry or some other eco-
nomic support had a sense of oneness
and community in the various in-
dividuals’ equal statuses and com-
mon dependence on that source of
support.

Rather it was Henry Ford who
gave us mass transportation that
gave birth to the huge city. The
mobility of individuals allowed them
to move away from their source of
economic support. Now the city
grows crazily with little sense of
pattern. People move frequently.
They have no roots, no home. Immi-
grants, both from without of the
country and minorities within, are
forced into the decayed parts of the
city, inte a community which is not

 

a community, searching for a mean-
ing or truth of life which may not be
there, abandoned by the churches
and other social institutions which
follow the middle class to the sub-
urbs, and, in summation, possessed
truly by the existential loneliness
that is characteristic of our age.
Can the City Survive

The lower class is but one, though
one of the largest, aspects of the
crisis we face with this new soci-
ological form, mass population. They
are part of an overriding question:
Can and should the city survive as
a social institution?

A social institution should provide
something of mutual benefit for the
individuals involved in it. Is the mass
city capable of giving its residents
any benefits? Do such benefits have
the greater value needed to counter-
act the drawbacks? Is there a danger
of the pendulum swinging the other
way from under socialization to
over-socialization? In all, in what
form should our population be dis-
tributed for the good of the com-
munity and the good of the individ-
ual?

A Most Important Problem

That this CONTACT weekend will
serve for arrival at a universally cor-
rect answer for all these questions is
doubtful. However, every person
owes it to himself and his community
to become well-informed, to become
involved in this problem, the most
important problem in our country
today, and in time to come and after
the question of birth rate, the most
important problem of the world.

It is hoped that all W&L men
will take advantage of this week-
end and hear all six speakers. Al-
though each seperate program is an
entity in itself, together they form
a valuable unity.

Professors Not Maintaining
Theory Of Unlimited Cuts

By ROY TYLER

The “new” cut system at Washing-
ton and Lee has produced a paradox
which has caused a great deal of
misunderstanding between faculty
and students.

Perhaps I am mistaken, but I
thought the term “unlimited cuts”
meant just that that cuts would
not be limited except before and
after holidays. Some professors, how-
ever, have begun a concentrated
campaign against the use of class
cuts, even though the student body
has been granted the privilege of
unlimited unexcused abscences

Seating Charts

Professors who make out
roles, assign seats, and make ridicu-
lous “seating charts” are, in effect,
denying the students in their classes
the privileges granted them by the
administration. In the light of the
new cut system, this type of proce-
dure is beth unwarranted and un-

clas ’

fais
lt is unwarranted because the fae-
ulty does not make attendance policy

 

ilege to have unlimited class cuts
only to immediately have this priv-
ilege denied them by individual pro-
fessors who think they should de-
termine university policy.
Destroy System
These professors believe they
should decide what the policy for
class attendance in their class should
be, but in this manner of thinking
they are destroying all the benefits
of the new system
The professors who deny their stu-
dents the privilege of unlimited cuts
are also being unfair, for they are,
in effect, saying that student No. 1

and student No. 2 should suffer
equally for four unexcused absences
Student No. 1, however, might be
able to take twice as many cuts as
student No, 2, and still maintain the
same quality of work

A professor who makes each stu-
dent suffer in direct proportion to
the number of classes that he cuts is

actually saying that class cutting is

more important than quality of work

Practice and Theory

THE RING-TUM PHI

Cagers Down Towson;
Spessard Back In Action

Washington and Lee’s basketball team split a pair of games
this past weekend. Friday night the Generals defeated Tow-
son College, 80-70. A first half spurt gave them a 46-39 lead

at intermission. Outscoring their opponents by 3 in the second

half, the Generals played an excellent game to notch their sixth
bs

victory of the season.

Spessard Shines

Rob Bauer led the Generals scor-
ing attack with 21 points, also mak-
ing him high scorer for the game.
Frank Morrison with 17, Bob Spes-
sard with 15, and John Carrere with
12 gave the Generals four men in
double figures. The most heartening
sight of the evening to Coach Can-
field was the return to early season
form by Spessard. Besides his 15
points, he hauled down 14 rebounds,
a game high for him this season.

Randolph-Macon came to Lexing-
ton Saturday night sporting a 12-4
record overall and 7-1 against state
competition. Heavily favored against
the Generals, the Yellow Jackets
were given a big scare before win-
ning by a four point margin, 77-73.

W&L Takes Lead

Washington and Lee jumped off to
a quick lead and was still ahead
25-20 with seven minutes left in the
first half. Then Randolph-Macon
got its fast break working, ripped
off 13 points while limiting the Gen-
erals to 8, and led 38-33 at the half.

Randolph-Macon increased its lead
to as much as twelve early in the
second half, but the Generals re-
fused to quit. Chipping away at the
Yellow Jackets, the Generals tied
the game on two free throws by
Rob Bauer with five minutes left in
the game. At this point Randolph-
Macon spurted to a 74-66 lead with
two minutes left. Still not Beaten
W&L clased the gap to 76-73 with 30
seconds left. The Yellow Jackets
added their last point on a foul shot
as the Generals were forced to foul
in their attempts to get the ball.
Spessard’s shot at the buzzer bounced

 

away thus leaving W&L the van-
quished by four bitter points

Optimistic Future

High scorer of the game was Frank
Morrison with 22 points, 13 coming
in the first half. Bauer and Earl Ed-
wards each scored 11 points. Ran-
dolph-Macon did not convert a free
throw in the first half as they had
only two chances. But it was their
15 free throws in the second half
which helped to hand W&L its 11th
defeat in 17 games. A hard loss for
the Generals, but one which showed
a vastly improved team which can
look more optimistically at the re-
mainder of its schedule.

Notice

February 16 is the deadline for
submitting manuscripts for the
winter issue of Ariel, scheduled for
publication the week of February
28. Short stories, poems, plays, re-

considered. Manuscripts should be
left in Ariel’s mailbox in the Stu-

There will be an AED meeting on
Thursday, February 10, at 5 p.m. in
the New Science Building. This
meeting will be concerned with the
election of new officers and a discus-
sion of future plans

 

Frank Morrison moves in for a jump shot during action in Saturday’s game against Randolph-Macon. The Gen-
erals were able to frighten the Yellow Jackets in a last minute rally which unfortunately was not enough to

overcome the spirited team from Ashland.

drafted from the Cleveland Browns.
He was young and unknown at the
time. Tubbs was a part time starter
for the 49ers. He insisted that he

Summer Geology Institute
Planned For Teachers
In Secondary Schools

The W&L Geology Department,
supported by the National Science
Foundation, has established a Sum-
mer Institute in Geology for secon-
dary school science teachers. Begin-
ning on June 20, about thirty high
school science and mathematics
teachers will attend classes in Howe
Hall and participate in field trips
through the Virginia Appalachians.
The Institute will be directed by Dr.
Odell S. McGuire, with the aid of
Dr. Samuel J. Kozak.

The Geology Institute was called
into being by the rapidly increasing
demand for earth science teachers in
the secondary schools of the eastern
seaboard. School in this area have
been turning to earth science as a
standard 9th grade course, relegating
the older “general science” courses
to the 7th and 8th grades. At the

Proposal Is Made At Meeting
To Increase Scope Of Booklet

By JOHN LEE
At last night’s IFC meeting, main
topics discussed were the IFC-spon-
sored CONTACT symposium to be
held this weekend and resolutions
concerning election of fraternity of-
ficers.

Phil Claxton, one of CONTACT’s

co-chairmen, announced that the
CONTACT brochures have _ been

printed and will be distributed this
week. Beginning Thursday at 4 p.m.,
and ending after the last meeting
Saturday evening, CONTCT plans a
real involvement with the problems
of “The City.”

Virginia schools of the area have
been well-informed about CON-
TACT,, and contingents from many
colleges are expected. IFC buses will
run this weekend, possibly at re-
duced rates, to accommodate the an-
ticipated turnout.

Claxton also announced that the
positions in the individual speaker’s
seminars are open for Thursday and
Friday. Anyone who desires to at-
tend a seminar should contact Roger
Sennott at 463-5453 for further in-
formation.

In order to facilitate a more effi-
cient committee system within the
IFC itself, and to enable house treas-
urers to carry out their duties with
greater accuracy, a proposal was dis-
cussed to elect fraternityPresidents
and Treasurers before the second
IFC meeting in February of each
year. Houses with national frater-
nity rules concerning election of of-
ficers would be exempt.

Also dealing with financial oper-
ations of the fraternities, Billy Can-
non introduced the possibility of the
IFC employing a CPA to oversee all
fraternity aoosUntng. In _this way,

at 8 p.m

All addresses will be held in Lee
Chapel and are open to the public.

A panel discussion among the
Speaker and students and faculty
members will follow each talk.
Questions from the audience will
then be heard
“The purpose of CONTACT is two-
fold.” Claxton, “first, to get
good quality speakers here to dis-
cuss current problems, and secondly
to interest students in learning more
ibout the problems of the day.”

The first CONTACT program was
held last March when six speakers
discussed “The American Experi-
ence and Its Applications for the
Individual Citizen, the American Na-
tion and the World.”

Smashed Skull Is Found
Near Old Freshman Dorm
By Terrified Freshmen

(Continued from page 1)
Identification in these cases, ac-
cording to Dr. Brockebough, is based
on the condition of the crainum it-
self, the teeth, and “other consider-
ations.” The name of the deceased is
almost impossible to determine with
any surety, he said, but there is a
record of Margaret Garrett, a
kitchen slave, who was murdered by
her husband in a drunken rage with
an iron pot handle on April 16,
1824.

Margaret Garrett was the property
of Jeremy Lyles Houston, and is
listed as buried in the family plot.

Only if further remains are dis-
covered, Dr. Brockebough said, will
this theory be corroborated. “There
were hundreds of burials made on
that land, which was over two acres
altogether,” observed Dr. Brocke-
bough, “and further evidence should
come to light soon, if it is the old
graveyard.” Brockebough also noted
that if it was the old Brockebough-
Houston-Campbell cemetery behind
the Co-op, the University might have
to repurchase the land from the des-
cendents of the families, in the ab-
sence of any original quitclaim deeds
to the grave sites. He called it a
remote but “intriguing” possibility.

Dr. Brockebough is 74
age, and has been retired
years.

Increased Financial Aid
Announced By Dean John
For the 1965-66 Session

The amount of financial aid Wash-
ington and Lee University awards
undergraduates has reached a rec-
ord $249,750, an increase of 15 per
cent over last year.

Dean Lewis G. John, director of
student financial aid, reports that
260 students are receiving that
amount. In addition, another 37 stu-
dents in the Washington and Lee
School of Law are receiving a total
of $24,915.

This is the highest amount the
university has awarded since it be-
gan an expanded financial program
five years ago. The program’s pur-
pose is to make the opportunity for
a Washington and Lee education
available to all qualified high school
students, regardless of individual
financial circumstances.

By comparison, the university
awarded $44,970 in the 1954-55 aca-
demic year. In 1960-61, the first year
of the new program, $154,119 was
awarded to 200 students.

The aid takes the form of grants,
loans and jobs, with some a combi-
nation of one or more. Most of the
recipients are under the grant-loan,
program.

The highest award, a combination
scholarship and job, is $2,500 this
year. Scholarship grants range from
$100 to $2,000.

While the aid this year has in-
creased 15 per cent overall, the as-
sistance to freshman is up more than
35 per cent, Dean John reports.
Seventy-six of the 347 entering
freshmen were awarded $87,000.

Chaffin’s Debate Team
Stretch Undefeated String
In Cambridge Tournament

The Washington and Lee debate
team extended its string of unde-
feated tournaments last weekend at
Harvard College in Cambridge, Mas-
sachusetts. Senior David Marchese,
speaking in the extemporaneous di-
vision, combined with sophomore de-
baters Hal Higginbotham and Tom
Baremore to give the W&L team a
record of four wins and four losses
in the tournament.

University of Richmond

This coming weekend, another
team of Washington and Lee debaters
will visit the University of Rich-
mond to compete in a varsity and
novice tournament. Debating for the
varsity team will be John McMurray
and Chris Mills. Harry Zeliff and
Kirk Woodward will represent
Washington and Lee in the novice
division.

Future Plans

Future plans for Dr. Chaffin’s de-
baters include a possible trip to
Dartmouth College on February 19.

The Washington and Lee Debate
team has one of the most successful
records in recent years thus far. The
team has a particularly strong fresh-
man group which insures a continu-
ation of the outstanding seasons of
recent years.

NSA Question

In addition to the intercollegiate
events Mr. Chaffin sponsors several
debates within the University com-
munity on topics of general interest.
He is expected to provide a forum
for the upcoming debate on the NSA
question. Interested students are
urged to contact him in regard to
the arrangements for this event.

Carpenter Asks NFL Questions

(Continued from page 3)

Alderman, an All-Pro offensive
tackle, was drafted from the Detroit
Lions after only one year in the
NFL. The other 35 draftees have
gone elsewhere.

The American League was much
more liberal in stocking the new
Miami Dolphins. Each team submit-
ted a list of 13 expendables from
which four were to be selected. The
Dolphins picked several players who
were part time starters during this
past season. Their system amounted
to allowing the clubs to protect their
first units plus one other man, which
in most cases would have been a
kicking specialist. Thus, the Dolphins
had a good chance at some slipping
veterans and rising youngsters. They
selected a nucleus of a good Ameri-
can League Team.

new club a chance to come into the
league on an even scale with some
of the weaker clubs? If the National

present time, there is an extreme
shortage of qualified earth science
teachers available to secondary
schools.

The National Science Foundation
has contributed $31,000 to W&lL’s
institute, making it the 39th summer
institute to begin training teachers
in earth science—more than in either
physics or chemistry.

The students attending the insti-
tute will spend six weeks at W&L,
using the university’s dormitory,
dining, and _ infirmary facilities.
Through a program of lectures, dis-
cussions, laboratory study, assigned
reading, and field excursions,
teachers will be given a basic and
practical understanding of the field of
geology.

the Falcons might have come up
with a team that could handle half
of the present clubs with a break or
two. As it is, it is safe to assume
that if the Falcons come within a
touchdown of anybody they will be
fortunate.

Seven Questions

Do you know anything about the
National Football League and _ its
players? Just for kicks see if you
can aswer the following seven ques-
tions.

Where did Gino Marchetti go to
college, and who was his coach
there?

In 1963 Arizona State had a fantas-
tic running backfield of Charlie Tay-
lof, Henry Carr, and Tony Lorick.
The quarterback is now a member
of a NFL taxi squad. Who is that
quarterback?

What is Chuck Bednarik’s alma
mater?

Who is the only player in the NFL
from South Dakota State?

Rudy Bukich, the quarterback for
the Chicago Bears, played for three
other teams in the NFL. Can you
name them?

Can you name the All-Pro defen-
sive cornerback of last season who
never played college football? He
was seen in the Pro Bowl this year.
He played basketball, and his broth-
er played for the Red Sox.

What NFL star today scored the
touchdown that broke the Nation’s
longest college football winning
streak in history?

EC Outlines Semester Plans
With Seven-Point Program

A seven-point program of general
objectives for the coming semester
was adopted by the WC in its meeting
Tuesday night.

President Fred Mindel, in propos-
ing the program, suggested that the
EC could perform more in the field
of legislation than it had done in the
previous semester.

The EC plans to discuss and act
upon the following topics:

1. National Student Association. As
agreed on in December, the question
of membership in the controversial
National Student Association will be
placed before the student body in a
referendum, proceeded by an open
debate in the ODK forum.

On Next Monday, Feb. 14, the 14-
member member ODK council will
meet to consider the EC’s request
to convene the ODK forum which
consists of all members of the uni-
versity interested in the topic un-
der discussion. If the council agrees
that a forum is necessary, a date
will be set for it to meet, probably
Monday, Feb. 14, since at least one
week must elapse between the meet-
ing of the council and of the forum.

The forum debates on the desir-
ability of joining NSA will be key-
noted by speakers brought in by
supporters of NSA and by the con-
servative Young Americans for Free-

Experts Unmask
Skullduggery
In Skull Find

A gigantic fraud was uncovered
yesterday when it was revealed to
the Friday Ring-tum Phi that the
shattered skull discovered Sunday
by two freshmen on the site of ex-
cavations behind the Old Co-op had
actually been planted there by per-
sons unknown.

The finding of the skull had caused
a great stir among area histor-
ians. The report of the find, pub-
lished in this week's Tuesday edition,
contained an interview with Dr. Ad-
dison G. Brokebough, a Rockbridge
County resident and professor emer-
itus of paleontology at the University
of Virginia.

Dr. Brokebough had identified the
skull to a reporter as belonging to
an elderly Negro woman, possibly
identified with one Margaret Gar-
ret, a kitchen slave murdered in 1824
and buried in a graveyard whose lo-
cation was later lost.

He suggested that the construc-
tion workers digging the foundations
for a new wing of the co-op had

ization,

The discussion will be the first un-
dertaken by the ODK Leadership
Forum since its general reorganiza-
tion last fall.

2. A More Ordered Election Sys-
tem. Recognizing that the collapse
of the party system is likely to cause
chaos in spring elections, the BC will
look into the possibility of reform-
ing election procedure along the lines
already followed with success during
freshman elections, including pri-
maries and runoffs between the top
candidates for each office.

The EC may also seek to change
the student government to allow EC
and class officer elections to be held
at different times, so that candidates
defeated in an EC election might run
for a class office.

3. Saturday Classes. Investigations
into the question of a five-day week
will be continued, perhaps with a
new student opinion poll; the EC
feels that the poll held last fall was
inconclusive and could have been
better presented.

4, Grading System. In response to
many complaints, both from students
and faculty, concerning a grading
system which allows a student with
a 70 to receive the same grade as a
student with a 79, while a student
with an 80 gets a higher one the BC
will investigate alternative systems.

5. Less Rigid Exam Schedule. In
order to prevent the barrage of five
exams in three days which is possible
under the examination schedule now
in effect, the EC will study the meth-
ods followed by other schools, in
which students are more or less al-
lowed to choose their own time to
take an exam within a certain time
period, or otherwise protected from
an unfair exam load.

6. Curriculum Committee. The EC
will consider the formation of a stu-
dent committee to evaluate courses,
such as is already in effect at schools
such as Yale, Hollins, and Sweet
Briar.

7. Girls in Dorms. The BC will seek
to abolish or modify the rule against
girls in the dormitories.

Each of the six last points of the
program will be looked into by an
EC committee. The committees will
present a preliminary progress report
to the EC on Feb. 22, and a final re-
port on March 1.

Library Self. Study Discusses
Budget, Physical Plant, Staff

At the student gathering for the
Library Self-Study, the problems of
physical plant, the budget, the staff
and the technical equipment of the
library were discussed.

Presided over by Dr. Allen Moger,
chairman of the Faculty Library
Committe, stated that the most ur-
gent need of the library was to pro-
cure more space. Only by the pro-
curation of additional space can the
library consider making increases in
the number of volumes in the li-
brary.

Behind this need for greater space
lies the problem of money. In order
to improve the library, the finances
available to the library have to be
increased. In less than twelve months
the library has received donations
amounting to $11,000. Also, the li-
brary is increasing its annual budget
from $6,000 to $48,000 over a ten year
period.

Two places are available for the
library to expand. Without great
physical work in the stacks of the
main library, the sixth level of the
building can be renovated to hold
old books which the fifth level now
holds. This will free space for 40,000
additional volumes on the fifth floor
The department now also has total
access to the basement. If a place can
be found to hold the ROTC Depart-
ment, the basement of the library
will be available for study rooms

The chief objective of the library
in purchasing books and periodicals
is to cover areas of student instruc-
tion. Presently the library purchases
books at the rate of 5,000 a year. Ol
these 5,000 books approximately 80
per cent are specified by members
of the departments

The self-study urged all faculty
members to submit a list of books
they needed. In addition to this

there is the possibility of each stu-
dent submitting suggestions to his
department head about books the
library needs.

Each department is allotted a set
sum of money for the purchase of
new books. Any money not used
specifically by the departments is
used for the purchase of boks and
periodicals of general value.

In the discussion of the physical
plant, the problem of noise in the
library was discussed. The students
generally agreed that the library
serves as a focal point for sudent
gatherings. The students also com-
plained about the poor chairs in the
library and the need for separating
the reading room from the general
study room on the main level of the
library.

The committee agreed to look into
the purchase of some comfortable
chairs for the library. Also, in de-
fense of the noise in the library, Mr.

Harrington Analyzes
Problem of Poverty

Michael Harrington, self-described
worker, author, and a forceful,

“radical,” civil-rights
entertaining public speaker,

probed the extraordinary extent of the problem of poverty,
especially in urban areas, last night in the opening address of

CONTACT 1966's investigatio

n of “The City.”

Poverty is one of the fundamental issues in our society

today, Harrington noted, and

under interest created in the

Kennedy and Johnson administrations and through the “Great

Society” program, the problem

“live debate rather than a rhetorical®
question.”

The standard governmental defini-
tion of poverty is misleading, the ob-
served; it assumes that any family of
any size in any geographic area is
poor if its income is $3,000 annually
or less. Practically, however, such a
comprehensive figure is almost
meaningless. In our present economic
structure, “poverty equals” for a
family of four $3,133 in urban cen-
ters, and $2,190 in farm regions.

the problem, are most helpful in
comphehending its immensity, Har-
rington continued. Perhaps most
striking is the fact that those fam-
ilies with the maximum “poverty-
level” incomes, the “best-off of the
poor,” can spend a total of ninety
cents at their major meal of each
day. These people do not live in
another world, Harrington stated,
but are Americans—and yet they do
not regularly eat meat or eggs.

The “most spectacular example of
the poor today,” Harrington ob-
served, “are the non-whites.” Seven-
ty-five per cent of the poor are
white—but only ten per cent of
the country’s total population is
non-white. The twenty-five per cent
of America’s poor which is non-
white represents forty-eight per cent
of the non-white population. These
people who are living at the
level of the Depression, Harrington
commented. Furthermore, nearly half
of the total poor are under eighteen
years of age; poverty affects one-
fifth of the total population, but one-
quarter of the population under
eighteen

Poverty problems are not nearly
solved with welfare money, he said.

Rush Books—Are They Worth It?

In recent years Washington and Lee fraternities have be-
come involved in an ever-increasing price war in order to
pledge the University’s top freshmen. Not many will deny that
the fraternities seem to be winning the war (each year nearly
80 per cent of the freshman class is pledged), but the price
they’re paying to accomplish this goal is becoming fantastic.

Total expenses for the fall’s most hectic week are now esti-
mated in excess of $25,000. That’s better than $40.00 per
“greek” upperclassman. It is our considered opinion that Rush
Week expenses are far out-of-line in relation to the amount
necessary to execute an efficient program.

This week the Interfraternity Council considered a pro-
posal which would abolish individual fraternity publications
and instead issue a single enlarged version of the IFC rush
brochure. Although the proposal was met with considerable
controversy, we feel the individual fraternities should seriously
consider such a change. It is true that the present program
offers each house an opportunity to deliver a more complete
summer rush message. We wonder, however, if this message
is worth the $12,000 it is now costing?

When every fraternity becomes involved in outdoing their
neighbors, which is what has been happening, the result be-
comes a literary stand-off at higher and higher printing costs.
The IFC proposal would allow each house an equal opportuni-
ty to present its sales message in a single edition that cost from
$7-9,000 less than the present system. Such a publication could
be handled by the University’s print shop, eliminating many of
the summer headaches faced by rush chairmen in meeting

commercial printer’s deadlines.

Aside from the cost factor there is great debate on whether
entering freshmen are not receiving too much rush material
now causing many booklets to find a home in a trash can.
Many we feel would prefer a 50-100 page booklet which of-
fers them all the information necessary about W&L frats under
one cover. This in itself would eliminate much of the duplica-
tion of information our present system encourages.

The proposal would not eliminate individual summer cor-
respondence or personal contact; the measure is designed solely
to reduce the excessive cost factor involved in printed literature.

It seems clear to us that such a step is needed and this
rational and, we believe, fair solution is the best means of
trimming fraternity rush budgets.

 

Awad Urges Delayed Rush

By JIM AWAD

Without a doubt, fraternities are
one of the most important influ-
ences on the student at Washington
and Lee. As a matter of fact, if one
were to eliminate fraternities from
the campus scene, our university
would little resemble the W&L we
are used to. It seems to me that in
the light of such importance and
such total integration into the social
and academic aspects of student life
that the subject of fraternities ought
to be handled with extreme care.

After “thoughtful consideration,”
I have come to the conclusion that
we are guilty of not exercising such
care by leaving rush week at the be-
ginning of the school year, and in
light of this I advocate the defer-
ment of rush week until the first
week of second semester.

First of all, fraternities, under
pressure to get a good pledge class,
often make mistakes in handing out
their bids. The inevitable result is
an internal fight as to whether to
ball the boy in question or not, and
usually the boy in fact is dismissed

Consequently, the house has been
weakened by internal strife, and one
poor freshman is left in a very dif-
ficult position. A second-semester
rush would undoubtedly give the
fraternities an entire semester to
compile a list of “desirables” and
“undesirables.”

Secondly, the freshman himself
often aceepts the wrong bid. Usually,
he will wait it out for a while just to
make sure, and by the time he does
depledge, it is usually too late for
him to join another house in time
to initiated with their pledge
class, and consequently being that
he must remain a super-pledge for

freshmen go through much pledging
without ever questioning the value
and importance of fraternity life to
them. Given the first semester to
analyze the situation, they would be
much better able to reach a rational
decision. This in turn, would elimi-
nate the pledging and initiation of
men who really aren't fraternity ma-
terial.

Critics of second semester rush
would point to the lack of social life
that would be available to the first
semester freshman. The only answer
that can be made to this charge is
that it assumes a static situation. The
mixers down the road afford fresh-
men the opportunity to meet girls;
and if the IFC and the administra-
tion participated in sponsoring
dances to relieve the situation and
in urging the fraternities to leave
their parties open, then the state of
affairs would not be that bad.

The weight of the evidence, then,
would seem to be in favor of second-

semester rush.

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

In last week’s discussion of the
Tahitian civilization, I ommitted the
most pertinent aspect of it—the
Tahitian attitude toward sexual mor-
ality. I did so because the Tahitian
concept of sex is radically different
from ours, and the subject needs
thorough treatment.

Tahitians are uninhibited by the
legalistic and often senseless morality
_ that we westerners
have concocted for
ourselves. Their
approach to sex is
that it is a delight-
ful fact of life, and
they indulge in it

shamelessly and
joyously.
Marriage is a

rather vague con-
cept for Tahitians,
and notions of
preserving one’s
chastity for a hypothetical mate are
extremely rare—if they exist at all.
Since everyone has “premarital”
sexual relations without any sense of
guilt or embarrassment, sex is fully
enjoyed without the psychological
anxiety inevitable to such relations
in our society.

A Typical Affair

In Papeete, I met a Tahitian girl
who insisted on discussing her affair
with an American sailor. With con-
siderable pride, she described their
sexual relationship and introduced
me to their “illegitimate” child. Then
she pressed his love letters on me,
urging that I read them all. After
I had done this—with some embar-
rassment—she composed a love letter
to him in French, which she per-
suaded me to translate into good
English. She then copied my trans-
lation in her own hand and sent the
letter to her sailor.

This girl is in no way untypical
of Tahitians, and despite my western
upbringing, I was unable to think of
her as “brazen” or “promiscuous” or
to apply to her any of the prudish,
rancorous adjectives that Americans
have stowed away for such situa-
tions.

Montgomery

Erotic Dances

A tremendous proportion of the
Tahitian culture is designed to stim-
ulate and beautify sex. Dancing, for
instance, is extremely erotic. It is
characterized by a frenzied music,
produced by a rhythmic, staccato
beat on bamboo and log percussion
instruments, matched by an equally
frenzied dance by women and men.
In the dance, a rapid shaking of the
hips is matched by a slower, grace-
ful movement of the torso, arms, and
hands. Grass skirts, worn by both
sexes, accentuate the movement of
the hips and produce a shimmering
effect. The dancers are naked to the
waist, but wear necklaces (heis) and
crowns of flowers and shells. The
entire effect is one of exciting, sen-
sual beauty.

These dances, sometimes accom-
panied by harmonious songs and
chants, may illustrate Polynesian
mythology or describe natural

 

aly Wr

  
 

events, but they have the basic, de-

 

 

 

 

 

liberate purpose of arousing desire
in the dancers.

Quatorze Juillet

Tahiti is the social center of the
Society Island Archipelago, and

young men and women frequently
migrate there, if only temporarily,
to participate in the native festivals
and to have greater sexual opportun-
ities. On the 14th of July (Bastille

 

Day) particularly, there is a great

 

A Young Tahitian Couple...

... free from

gathering of the islanders to indulge
themselves in days of dancing, cele-
bration, and lovemaking. The Ta-
hitians eagerly anticipate the annual
Bastille day, though not for the same
reasons as the French.

Obviously, the Tahitian attitude
toward sex produces many babies
“born out of wedlock,” an occurance
which distresses western moralists.

The word “illegitimate” has no mean-
ing for the Tahitians, however, and
babies are far from a problem in
the islands. Polynesians have an in-
nate love of children and consider
them community property; they are
even given away to childless people.
In fact women are expected to have
children before settling down with
one man, in order to prove their
fertility.

Thus, the Polynesian sense of sex-

 

the restrictions of Western morality.

ual morality is strikingly different
from ours. While western prudery
has occasionally labeled Polynesian
sex relations as orgiastic, they are in
reality far more innocent than our
own. Tahitians do not connect sin
with sex; they go into sexual rela-
tions entirely without feelings of
guilt. The same cannot be said for us,
who regard sex as the antithesis of

innocence and who are inescapably
burdened with guilty consciences in
our relations.

The Dying Civilization

In this article, and in last week’s,
I have described the ideal side of
modern Tahitian life. That view
taken by itself is deceptive, for the
modern Tahitian is beset by serious
threats to his native existence.

The Tahitians have so far been
able to preserve much of their
civilization intact, especially on the
out-islands. They are being rapid-
ly westernized, however, and their
way of life is doomed to eventual
extinction,

Almost half of the population of
Tahiti is Chinese—people originally
brought in as laborers when the
French found that Tahitians would
not “work.” The Chinese have cher-
ished and maintained their own cul-
ture, and are procreating much more
rapidly than the Tahitians. Soon,
they will be given full property and
voting rights, and the un-competi-
tive Polynesian civilization will be
swamped under a wave of Chinese
commercialism.

“Western Virtues”

The French, too, are busily trying
to inflict the virtues of western
progress on the Tahitians. This
progress inevludes roads, automo-
biles, tourism, radio and _ T.V,,
French language schools, and an
atomic testing installation—all of
which the Tahitians detest.

The Tahitians appreciate their cul-
ture and well realize that it is fa-
tally threatened, but they are almost
powerless to fight back. To cope with
the Chinese and French, they would
have to become just as competitive
and modern, and then they would
have lost their civilization anyway.
Armed rebellion would be insane
on such a small island, though sev-
eral Tahitians talked to me of revo-
lution.

Hatred for the French and Chin-
ese is intense. A Tahitian friend of
college age once told me that he
would begin killing the French right
now, if only he had a gun. Never-
theless, it should be said for the
French that they have destroyed
their Polynesian colonies much less
rapidly that the United States, Japan,
Chile, Germany, or Britain.

Despite the impending end of
Polynesian society, Tahiti remains
today an earthly paradise, both in
the nature of its people and in its
physical beauty. I feel that of the
many places I have recently seen,
that Tahiti is unsurpassed in both
qualities.

munist riot—Tokyo, Japan.)

 

Letters To The Editor

 

Tyler Responds; Court Disgusts Kramer

Tyler Verbally Assulted
Dear Sir,

After being verbally assaulted by
several members of the faculty con-
cerning my article of last Tuesday,
I feel it necessary that I apologize

 

 

for one mistake I made.

v*

   

 

 

 

I mentioned the fact that some
professors were not following the
new cut system put into effect by
the administration. Since the article
appeared, I have been told that it
was not the administration which
initiated the new cut system, but the
faculty members themselves.

Since the Tuesday editor allowed
the article to go into the paper
without calling my attention to the
error I apologize for my making the
mistake. I do not, however, feel that
my position should be changed

I did not say that the individual
faculty members did not have the
right to check attendance in thei:
classes; I merely stated that either
the rule should be changed to read
that each professor should determine
attendance in his classes, or each
professor should abide by the un-
limited cut rule which they them-
selves made.

Though I told that
there some “sour grapes” in
the new ruling, I do not feel that this
is sufficient reason for professors to
renounce it, which, in effect, they are
doing when they make a student suf-
fer beeause he has used the privilege
of unlimited cuts, If there are mem-
bers of the faculty who are definitely
against the unlimited cut rule, then
the rule should perhaps read “
each professor shall determine clas

have been

were

attendance.” Something definite
however, should be said

A student should not have to rely
on the advice of someone who had
a professor the year before and
thinks that he gives student an au-

omatic “C” if he cute more than

 

a week of classes. If this ia the way
that a professor feels, then he should
tell his students that. This, however
is taboo, for we are suppo ed to have
unlimited cuts

0 '

The whole prothem i viciou
cirele though some professors

 

make students suffer for what they
term “excessive cutting,” there is no
official way that they can warn a
student. They can call a student
down for it, but he does not know
what point must be passed before his
grade begins to suffer.

What I believe should be done is
either have the rule changed to read
that each professor will determine
Class attendance, or have the faculty
abide by the unlimited cut rule
which they themselves made. We
would like to know just where we
stand.

Improving Cagers Defeat RPI, 72-71

By CHARLIE BENSINGER

Washington and Lee basketball is
fast giving Coach Verne Canfield
ulcers, but he doesn’t really mind—
not now that the Generals are win-
ning. It happened again Tuesday
night in Richmond as it was W&L
72, R.P.1. 71.

The Generals started slowly, miss-
ing their first seven shots and fall-
ing behind, 6-0, before freshman
John Carrere pulled ofl a three-point
play with an assist from running-
mate Jody Kline.

W&L later pulled within three
again at 18-15 on a Bauer fast-break
following a blocked R.P.I. shot by
Steve Sweitzer.

When Carrere hit a ten-foot jump-
er on another fast-break with 6:56
remaining in the half, W&L pulled
ahead for the first and only time of
the half, 26-25. At the midway point
it was RPI by six, 39-33, as the Gen-
erals could hit only 31 per cent in
the first twenty minutes.

The second half started the same
way, but W&L finally edged ahead
for good at 46-45 as junior forward
Frank Morrison hit a three-foot fol-
low shot.

Then the Generals’ Rob Bauer be-
gan to hit, scoring 13 of W&L’s re-

the game’s high scorer with 31 points,
kept the Rams in the game, scoring
18 of his points in the closing 12
minutes.

The Generals’ lead fluctuated for
the next few minutes as W&L tried
to build a lead. But R.P.L, down
72-67, rallied and got the ball with
47 seconds left, trailing by only one.

After a short stall, Co-Captain C.
G. Winston rimmed a long jumper
with 15 seconds left. Jody Kline re-
bounded for W&L and was fouled
with 11 seconds to go. Kline, whose
two free throws in the closing sec-
onds, defeated R.P.I. in Lexington,
then missed the first of the one-and-

Creech rebounded and called time-
out with only 8 seconds remaining.

The Washington and Lee freshman
basketball team has evened its sea-

since the beginning of the second
semester.

The first day of action saw the
freshmen, led by Ken Long’s 16
points and 18 rebounds, defeat Vir-
ginia Episcopal School 62-58. Fol-
lowing Long in the scoring were
Greg Crampton with 12 and Lloyd
Cunningham with 10.

The second win of the week was
over Fishburne Military Academy,
91-56, as Greg Crampton was the
star with 21 points and 25 rebounds.
Long chipped in with 18 points,
Cunningham with 12, and Larry
Boetsch with 10. Crampton was help-
ed on the boards by Richard Lohr-

In scoring their seventh win of the
season W&L hit 38 per cent and
placed four players in double fig-
ures—Bauer with 22, Morrison and
Carrere with 14, and Spessard with
10. The Generals also won the bat-
tle of the boards, 52-38, as Spessard
pulled down 12 and Morrison grab-
bed 11.

Coach Canfield has said that the
recent success of the Generals, win-
ners of five of their last eight games,
has done wonders for the team. For
the first time in years, a W&L team
has not only desire, but also pride
and confidence in itself.

Dear Mom and Dad,

The lucky readers of this famous,
or infamous, column just don’t know
how lucky they are. Right now it is
3:00 on Thursday afternoon, and
every single person in the plush of-
fices of the Ring-tum Phi has in-
formed me they do not wish to write
my column for me this week. There-
fore, I have no choice but to do the
deed myself.

At least I have a hot tip for every-
one. Clifton Forge High School will
be playing over at VMI this Tues-
day night. The reason that I call
this to your attention is a rather big
one, all 69” of him. He is Walker
Banks, who could become another
Westley Unseld

Wednesday night Clifton Forge, a
group II classification team, played
away at Covington who is leading the
I-B Blue Ridge District, and beat
them 89-50

Banks, with three personals in the
first quarter and a half still scored
27 points, pulled in 31 rebounds, and
blocked 8 shots

In the only game of the season
when Banks didn't get into foul
trouble and was allowed to play the
whole game, he scored 63 points
That's bad, and with a little
practice he could even become a

not

score!

Now to answer the question, “Just
who is Westley Unseld?” Ask any-
one from Louisville. Better still, just
ask anyone who follows the Missouri

LOCATED AT SHOPPING CENTER

“It’s almost impossible to hold
our practices any later,” said Mc-
Laughlin, “since many of our players
would be engaged in the regular
spring sports.”

The Generals, who could manage
only a 3-6 record last fall with 22
lettermen on the line and nine more
in the backfield, this year will count
two more letter winners in the back-
field, but 11 less up front. Both
tackle and guard positions, and left
end have just one letterman, while
center and right end are better for-
tified with three monogram winners.

“This definitely will be a building
year,’ said McLaughlin. “We have
lost 22 players to graduation, in-
cluding fullback John Anthony, ends
Tersh Baker and Bob Barclay, line-
backer Joe Miller, tackles Starke
Sydnor and Jack Kelly, and backs
Larry Craig and Billy Andrews.
Each one was honored with some
kind of all-star recognition this past
year.”

 

Snow Won't Stop Coach Mac;
Spring? Drills Begin On Time

If McLaughlin is to find help, he’ll
have to turn to, perhaps, the largest
aggregation of freshmen ever to turn
out for spring drills. In all, 32 first-
year players have indicated a desire
to report, and that’s almost every-
one that played for the Brigaders
(4-2 record) last fall.

“We have at least two freshmen at
every line position, and 14 in the
backfield,” said McLaughlin. “If they
come along like we think they will,
it would be very possible that we
could have a fine season next fall.

On the basis of the unexpected
turnout, the Generals should have
one of their more talented backfields
in recent years. Three lettermen
quarterbacks—Andy Bloom, Bryant
Kendrick, and Jim Oram—will be
helped by eight left halfbacks, six
fullbacks, and seven right halfbacks.

Lettermen Rudd Smith and Buddy
Atkins are the top contenders for
the starting left half spot, with Smith

Library Funds
Discussed By
Self-Study

(Continued from page 1)
Henry Coleman, head librarian,
stated that the library has poor
accustics and that this problem does
not take precedence over the needs
of the library presented above.

If money is raised, the library
building itself may be extended
back towards the Old Dormitory.
This extension in the physical plant
will provide more room for indivi-
dual study carrells and also more
room for stacks.

The question of staff tenureship,
faculty standing for library assist-
ants and the hours of the library
were discussed briefly. The library
committee supported staff tenure-
ship on the grounds that it helped
attract and keep competent librar-
ians, since along with such status
there are fringe benefits. Also after
heated debate by the students, the
library is seriously considering leav-
ing the library open on Saturday
nights. There is one difficulty in this
plan, however. The library needs a
larger staff to handle the increased
hours and also the student helpers
in the library have to have greater
incentive to attend to their job on
time.

The meeting closed with the dis-
cussion of Xerox coin-operated
copying machines. The libray had
discarded the idea on the grounds
that the machine was unreliable.
Several students, however, verified
the dependability of the machines.
The library committee has promised
to look into the possibility of pur-
chasing one .

are proud of the reputation of our
paper, which has always been based
on our respect for the truth,” said
news editor Steve Saunders, who
had interviewed Dr. Brokebough,
“and this affair has cut us deeply.”

Dr. Brokebough himself was inter-
viewed by a reporter yesterday
afternoon on his reaction to the un-
covering of the hoax.

“I was grossly misquoted!” stated
Dr. Brokebough. “I find it incredible
that your reporter could have so
radically misinterpreted — I might
even say, embroidered upon—what
I said.”

Dr. Brokebough continued: “Of
course I spotted the incription right
away, and immediately suspected the
truth. But while I was examining it
l might have made a few chance
remarks, not to be taken seriously —
you understand, something like ‘This
reminds me of the skull of a mur-
dered woman I once saw in Ruanda-
Urundi.’ Yes! that’s it! Just a chance
remark, you know. Did you write
that down? As for a whole grave-
yard...1 was thinking how interest-
ing it would be, you know, if it
were all true. So I might have made
one or two humorous conjectures.
Certainly not what I was quoted as
saying. No, Sir!”

Dr. Brokebough, who revealed that
his health has been shattered by the
affair, leaves this evening for an ex-
tended vacation in South America.

sought jobs and been unable to find
them that they have stopped look-
ing; they do not consider “under-
employment” and “miserable jobs”
held by young people. Taken abso-
lutely, our present unemployment
rate would be scandalous in Europe,
where German manufacturers are
importing workers from other na-
tions to fill out the labor force.

Our economy is expanding at such
a rate that within twenty years, it
will double to a level of 1.5 trillion
dollars. But such economic growth
benefits those who are not poor
most—the recent tax cut, for ex-
ample, decreased the payments of
the largest taxpayers far more than
those of the poor.

Proposals which appear to be en-
tirely workable and practical are
numerous, Mr. Harrington continued.
A Commission on Automation, com-
posed of leaders from business, la-
bor, government, and the academ-
ic worlds has recommended a guar-
anteed income at a fundamental
level to every citizen. We must
strive, Harrington stated, to create
“a society in which everybody eats.’
Americans have a right to such in-
come, he observed, to do with what
they want.

Urban renewal is of prime con-
cern in alleviating the problems of
urban poverty. Cities must be vir-
tually re-built, but, unfortunately,
Mr. Harrington observed, President
Johnson's proposal is more spectac-
ular than his appropriation for ac-
tion: this year, $5 million have been
allotted to redevelopment—which

funds are part of a Ford grant.
The National Planning Commission
has said that cities need 2.1 trillion
dollars over the next twenty years.

Automation, Harrington continued,
is a problem only when a useful
occupation is not substituted. We
must try to eliminate “stooped and
degrading” labor; there are jobs to
replace these which do not require
college degrees. The Democratic
Study Group of 180 liberal Repre-
sensative to Congress endorses this
plan strongly, he said.

In his conclusion, Harrington noted
that in our society, the unit of dis-
cussion in relation to the future must
be not the wage-hour relationships,
but rather lifetimes. Society appears
to be terrified of its own affluence.
We must consider new kinds of
work, new lifetimes, as we approach
the Aristotelean ideal of a society
in which slavery can be abolished as
“inanimate objects of their own
movements make things.”

By CHIP TOLBERT
ESQUIRE’S FASHION EDITOR

CALLING ON THE BOARD! In order to set our 1966 campus

fashion reports in the proper perspective, we called upon members
of Esquire’s 1965 College Advisory Board to bring us up to date
on what’s being worn on campuses North, East, South and West
this winter. What regional fashion shifts occur as you move about
the country? How does the casual attire worn in the West, for
example, differ from that worn in the East? And which fashion
trends seem most likely to spread out to other areas of the country?
For some authoritative answers, read on...

THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH, according to
Michael Mains, University of Arizona ’65,
there’s a brisk traffic in lightweight conserva-
tive suits with the dash of color supplied largely
in neckwear, Striped ties predominate, but
foulards are moving in again. Everybody wears
button-downs, and the three-piece suit is in-
frequently seen on campus. In the mornings,
when there’s apt to be a chill in the air, a
sweater worn with a button-down sport shirt
and wheat jeans is sufficiently warm and in-
formal enough for class. Heather-toned sweaters
hold the edge, and corduroy jeans or wash-and-
wear khakis complete the casual scene. In feot-
wear, a wing tip properly complements a suit,
while saddle shoes or loafers are a standard part
of the informal picture.

SWINGING NORTH, Richard Gentry, Jr., University of Michigan,

tells us that for north-country winters the rugged toggle coats are
serviceable and popular. Above the knee lengths are what every-
one’s wearing. Here, the accent falls heavily on the informal touch:
V-neck sweaters in solid colors; button-downs, both plain and
striped; tapered corduroys and wheat jeans; and a solid serving
of loafers and chukka boots. For fraternity parties and other social
events, plaid sport jackets are beginning to make the scene. Her-
ringbone and heather sport jackets lead the field, but big patterns
are beginning to make some headway. In neckwear, there's a trio
of popular entries: stripes, club figures and paisleys. Semiformal
slacks are usually tapered flannel, and loafers or wing-tip shoes go
best with the sport jacket and slacks.

 

WAY OUT WEST, at Berkeley, Scott Gregg in-

forms us that one of the unique features on
his campus is the colored sneaker. Perhaps this
is a manifestation of Berkeley's celebrated pen-
chant for innovation. Beyond that, the fashion
picture, both in casual and dressy attire, follows
patterns familiar throughout the rest of the
country’s campuses, V-neck sweaters predomi-
nate, with crew necks a close second. Sport
shirts appear in a wide, but not necessarily wild,
variety of patterns and colors. Madras is the
outer limit. Permanent press casual slacks and
blue jeans are In in the casual order of things.
Herringbone, hound's-tooth, and heather mix-
tures complete the sport jacket picture, with
greens and grays the most popular colors in the
tapered slacks which are worn with the jacket.
Colored or pin stripe button-downs and diagonal-striped ties (plus

 

loafers) round out the accessories picture.

ON THE EASTERN SEABOARD, the big thing,

according to John Lamb, Jr. of Princeton, is
boots. Everybody seems to be wearing them
with informal clothing especially during the
winter months, for they obviate the need for
rubbers or galoshes, Ski jackets are now stan-
dard apparel as are heather crew-neck sweaters, Subdued, dark
colors rule the sport jacket scene. Worn with them are colored or
striped button-downs and repp ties. Moving over to the casual side
of the wardrobe, dark-colored flannel slacks give way to severely
tapered trousers. For dress up occasions, smooth leather loafers or
wing tips; for casualwear, brushed leather loafers or chukka boots,

NEXT MONTH the Old Order passes to make way for the New

ESQUIRE’s recently-elected 1966 College Advisory Board will be
preparing to head for New York to help us authenticate the newest
campus fashion trends and innovations. See you then,

Teachers Plan
Institutes Here
During Summer

French and ads Dept.
To Sponsor Secondary
High School Program

By WAYNE SUNDAY

Normally, the Washington and Lee
University campus during the sum-
mer months is fairly deserted after

the students, and the faculty
make their annual mass exodus in
June.

But this summer the campus will
be—by comparison with past sum-
mers—alive with activity. Besides
the usual 30-40 students in the Law
School summer session, there will be
80 secondary school teachers enrol-
led in two summer institutes.

And there will be approximately
20 Lexington area high school stu-
dents taking part in a special “dem-
onstration class” during one of the
institutes.

Fifty of the secondary school
teachers will attend an NDEA In-
stitute in French. The other 30 will
take part in a summer institute in
geology sponsored by the National
Science Foundation.

Both institutes will begin June 20.

The geology session will last six
weeks until July 29; the French in-
stitute will continue another two

weeks until Aug. 12.

jHarrington Voted Best Speaker
In Yesterday’s Ring-tum Phi Poll

By STEVE SAUNDERS
News Editor

CONTACT ’66 received a weighty endorsement from the
We&L student body, as revealed in an unannounced Ring-tum
Phi poll taken yesterday. The poll showed that 61.3% of the
student body had participated in the weekend’s activities, and

that 83%

favored continuation of the program in future years.

Social critic Michael | Harrington was picked as best speaker by

Date Set For

Of Journalists

Sigma Delta Chi Endorses
State Recommendation

To End Censorship

Six journalists and one profession-
al journalists are scheduled to be ini-

tiated into Sigma Delta Chi in a
ceremony here tentatively set for
March 15.

Identity of the students and the

newsman will be made known when
the board of directors of the national
professional journalistic society acts
on the nominations made by the lo-
cal chapter, Mauriece Fliess, chapter
president, said this week.

The chapter during 1965-66 has
held receptions for two visiting
journalists who lectured on cam-
pus, instituted a fund to provide
more books for the journalism de-
partmental library, and planned a
photographic exhibit for the Reid
Hall foyer.

It also endorsed a recommendation
made by retiring Virginia Gov. Al-
bertis S. Harrison, Jr., that the state
legislature abolish the Virginia Mo-
tion Picture Censorship Board. At
the chapter's February meeting, mo-
del laws proving for open meetings
and open records in localities were
approved to be sent to area members
of the Virginia General Assembly for
consideration, as was the resolution
opposing film censorship.

The chapter will assist in the
planning and duties involved in
the Southern Interscholastic Press

Association convention which will be

held at W&L April 29-30

516 Students Polled

Five-hundred sixteen _ students
were polled, at least one-third of
whom were freshmen. Canvassers

were stationed throughout the day
at Washington Hall and the fresh-
man Quad, and in the Commons
during the midday meal.

Of those who attended lectures,
the largest group (30.6%) attended
only one. Those attending two lec-
tures made up 28.7% of the group
questioned; 22% attended three lec-
tures; 11.2% were at four lectures;
and only 7.4% participated in all
five.

Brown Next Best

Harrington was the overwhelming
favorite for top speaker with 63%.
Claude Brown was next with 17.6%,
followed closely by Dr. Ernest Van
den Haag who received 17.5% of the
votes. Dr. Jay T. Wright and Ber-
nard E. Norwitch were tied with
each receiving 1.2%.

Only fourteen students (3%)
thought that CONTACT should be
discontinued. Fourteen per cent had
no opinion. Three of those who vot-
ed to abolish CONTACT did not at-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che King-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Tuesday Edition

Praise For CONTACT

Editorial note:

(The following article appeared in the Sunday New York
Herald Tribune and is reprinted in full. The Ring-tum Phi
believes that the content of this column provides a more than
adequate tribute to CONTACT. We do, however, wish to add
our congratulations to the members of the steering committee
for an outstanding achievement. Since this year’s program
profited from the mistakes of the first venture, we can antici-
pate conitinued success for the IFC’s intellectual symposium.)

 

Perhaps the competitiveness and the status-hunger of the
American middle class will produce a new generation of college-
educated idealists.

This notion is not occasioned by a visit to Berkeley or Ann
Arbor, or some other vanquished center of student revolt and
new leftism.

It was evoked by a visit to Washington and Lee Univer-
sity. I spoke there in an historic chapel, holding forth on the
miseries of American society from a rostrum located almost
directly over the crpyt of Gen. Robert E. Lee. Washington and
Lee is not an intensely political school: it has no chapter of
Students for a Democratic Society, no organized anti-war pro-
test movement, and, for that matter its only activity on Viet
Nam was the gathering of a petition in favor of President
Johnson’s position. It is an institution with roots going back
into American life as far back as 1747, the students tend to
come from well-off families, and it has even had its association
with the Southern gentleman conception of what a college
should be.

And yet there was a warm, even enthusiastic, response to
my advocacy of a guaranteed annual income, massive multi-
billion-dollar investments in low-cost housing and other ex-
penditures in the social sector. They even greeted my call for
a redefinition of work in American Society. And the speaker
whom the students have invited to conclude this week’s lecture
series is Claude Brown, the author of “Manchild in the Prom-
ised Land,” a graduate of the Harlem streets and New York
State juvenile correctional system. If my remarks gave the Lee
crypt a spin or two, I should imagine that Brown’s presence
would turn the Confederate general’s shade into a whirling
dervish.

It is the most recent article of faith in the technologically
revolutionary society that a good education is the key to a young
person’s future. For the middle class, the rat race now begins
at the nursery school, which determines access to a good grade
school, and the latter is a key to a fine high school, which in
turn prepares the young scholar for his first-rate college and
professional or graduate school, and finally all the travail pro-
duces, not such a diploma, but a credit card. All of this can
have cruel consequences for the young, and it is, of course,
a perversion of the very meaning of learning. Yet, because of
this new status hysteria, today’s college student is often brighter,
better-prepared—and ready to become critical of the very
parental values which drove him into the world of ideas as if
it were a market place.

A minority of these students become active rebels, They
tend to be the brightest young men and women at the best col-
leges and universities (the surest sign of academic quality I
know of is the presence of a large group of radicals: e.g., the
Ivy League and the top state schools are disproportionately
represented in the jails of Mississippi and the peace marches).
But another, less dramatic expression of the same trend is the
vast increase in the number of students who, though not radical
activists, are critical of the status quo, suspicious of precisely
those money-and-status-dominated values that education was
supposed to confirm in them.

I do not want to over-praise all this, for there are obviously
profound things wrong with higher education in America, to
day. For one thing, it is, as the Berkeley students brilliantly
pointed out, quite often bureaucratic, technocratic and even
anti-intellectual. For or another, the middle class is devoting so
much private and public money and so much anguish to the
schools in order to preserve radical and class distinctions
and to be sure their children keep well ahead of the poor. And
yet there is reason for some optimism in the fact that the ac-
complishment of these base purposes requires that young peo-
ple be exposed to the dangers of thinking. It is a risky situation
when a society has become so complex that you have to insist
that the middle-class youth be serious and subject themselves
to ideas. It was thus for Stover of Yale, or even Andy Hardy.
The result could be a new political source of support for liberal,
and even radical, social reform which, I suspect, is not exactly
what the proud parents thought they were buying in the knowl-
edge shop.

So I remain, Gen. Lee, your disobedient but grateful
Signed, Michael Harrington

A Mistaken Impression?

The attendance at last week's Self-Study meeting on the
library was particularly encouraging. Although the discussion
was lively and constructive, there was some question as to
the spirit in which it was received. It appeared that a number
of significant inquiries were dismissed as impractical or, at best,

servant.

worthy of limited consideration. We hope that this impression |
was a mistaken one, and that future action by this committee |

will incorporate the suggestions and proposals which were pre

sented at the meeting.

By BRUCE W. RIDER
As I was starting through my stacks
of fan mail not long ago, I noticed
that many people wrote to ask why
there was not a column by cute me
last Tuesday.

What the situation is, friends, is
that I and my fellow classmates are
Second Semester Seniors, a danger-
ous and unsettled breed.

By this time in our college careers
we have either done well enough to
get into a good graduate school or
get a good job—or we have not. Dur-
ing the past seven semesters either

 

we have proved ourselves—or we
have not. Therefore the slogan of the
Second Semester Senior: What the
hell.

So—it is possible that any senior
may or may not have a column ap-
pearing regularly, Or have the news-
paper appear regularly. Or the senior
himself may not appear regularly.
Bear with us, then, friends, readers,
and be glad and happy when you
see or hear from us at all.

Proper Planning
If a man has planned his college
studies properly, he is taking note of

At last Roanoke has been sup-
plied with an appreciable form of
entertainment. A new dinner thea-
tre, featuring a “magic stage” in the
round, has recently opened on the
airport road off Route 119 (only five
minutes from Hollins).

Rustic Atmosphere

The Barn Dinner Theatre provides
an excellent buffet dinner (with
set-ups) served in a rustic atmos-
phere, in addition to a professional-
ly acted show produced and direct-
ed in New York by Howard D.
Wolfe Productions.

Operating on a year-round sched-
ule, the Barn is the only Dinner
Theatre of its type in Roanoke and
the surrounding. The Barn’s
policy is to produce a play for a pe-
riod of four weeks, Tuesday through
Sunday of each week.

Professional Cast

Each production features a pro-
fessionally-trained cast whose mem-
bers have received extensive dra-
matic experience in various Broad-
way and Repertory Companies.

Presently, Mr. Wolfe. the Execu-
tive Producer ,has five other dinner
theatres in Richmond, Greensboro,
Atlanta, Charlotte, and Raleigh-
Durham. Each production tours all

New Barn Dinner Theatre
Brings Drama To Roanoke

six cities allowing a new show to
appear every month. Future plans
call for establishing a coast to coast
network of dinner theatres.

New Idea

The importance of this operation
is that in American cities the size of
Roanoke, there is a surprising lack
of permanent performing institu-
tions, especially in the South and
Mid-West. Mr. Wolfe's efforts prom-
ise to bring a new idea in profes-
sional repertory to these regions.

Having just concluded a fine per-
formance of “Sunday in New York,”
directed by Johnathan Bolt, the
Barn has recently opened “Will Suc-
cess Spoil Rock Hunter.” Future
productions will include “Bus Stop,”
“The Importance of Being Earnest,”
“Shot in the Dark,” and “Picnic.”

Reservations

Reservations may be made by
calling the Box office in Roanoke
(362-3333) between the hours of
9:00 am. and 11:00 p.m. The gour-
met dinner is served at 7:00 p.m.
and is followed by the play which
begins at 8:30 p.m,

The Barn reserves Monday eve-
nings for special productions for
groups and private parties.

any significance in this his last col-
lege semester. And he takes no
course that (or which) meets
before ten-fifteen, and surely he will
not take a course meeting in the
sunny afternoon. Hoepfully, he is in
the Honors Program, which means
no classes at all but one hell of a
busy April when he has to concoct
a thesis.

This second semester of my sen-
ior year I am taking five courses
which (or that) will enable me to
get the highest possible grades at
the lowest possible cost to my val-
uable health and time.

My first course, which meets on
alternate rainy Monday afteroons, is
Commerce 808, “How to Get and
Hold an Easy Job.” This is related to
another course I’m taking, in Ac-
counting, “How to Fool the Audi-
tors and Buy Them Off it Neces-
sary.”

Art, of couse, is something we all
should be acquainted with, so Fine
Arts 24450, “Big and Fleshy Nudes”
fits nicely into the schedule.

Enduring Meaning

Our education, as we all know,
will continue As Through This
World We Wend Our Way, so I am
enrolled in Comparative Literature
902, “The Study and Use of Read-
er’s Digest Condensed Books.”

Some of the more intellectual
seniors are taking Comparative Lit-
erature 904, “Intensive Reading in
the Book of the Month Club Selec-
tions,” but why push yourself.

I have always been told that psy-
chology would be of value in later
life (whatever that is) thus I am
taking. “The Care, Study and Fool-
ing Around With White Rats.” If I
ever meet up with a white
some day I will surely know how
to deal with him and understand his
psychological problems.

Prospective Alumnus

In the dark recesses of every sen-
ior’s mind is the knowledge that be-
ginning in June he will be an Alum-
nus. A thrilling thought.

(“Alumnus,” by the way, is a Latin
word meaning “short, fat, and some-
what dull.”)

Only when we are Alumn, of
course, will we be able to express
ourselves intelligently concerning
matters of the University. When we
have been in lowa or Texas for ten
or twenty years with nary a visit
to Lexington we will be able at last
to see clearly how things are and
how things should be at our fair
campus.

So—be kind to your Valentines
and show mercy for us Second Se-
mester Seniors. We need all the help
we can get.

 

 

Rush Booklets

Are Necessary

The Ring-tum Phi
Washington and Lee University
Dear Editor,

The recent IFC proposal to incor-
porate all fraternity rush booklets
into one massive volume would do
great damage to many fraternities at
Washington and Lee.

The individual rush booklet en-
ables every fraternity to present
something which makes that frater-
nity unique from others at W&L.
In a single booklet a rush chairman
is able to emphasize this unique-
ness as much as he wants. This
would be impossible to do in a large
book, where his fraternity can only
be but one chapter in eighteen. Most
fraternity men feel that their house
has something special and should not
be looked at merely as another fra-
ternity in a polygot of sigmas kap-
pas, and taus.

Houses with a small national
name have a chance to assert their
own strengths in the single rush
booklet. In a large rush manuel
these houses would not receive the
same interest that the “big time”
fraternities would.

The different foremat which each
rush manual adopts (the Delt news-
paper, the DU “Time Magazine,”
ete.) make the individual rush book-
lets considerable more interesting to
the incoming freshman than one gi-
gantic book where each house has a
limited space to fill.

Finally, there is a most important
argument to consider. Most fraterni-
ty men feel that money spent on
rush booklets is well spent. They
should have the choice of pursuing
rush as they see fit within the Rush
Rules. And rush booklets certainly
are still in the rules.

Lastly, many house have little or
no contact with their alumni
throughout the year. The only
way that they can keep their alum-
ni posted on the progress of their
fraternity (without publishing ex-
pensive alumni letters) is through
the mailing of rush booklets. If
these rush boklets are abolished,
then the school will have lost a
valuable source of alumni contact.

Hopefully, fraternities will con-
sider this matter closely at the next
IFC meeting. It is worthy of their
attention,

Sincerely
ANDREW N. BAUR

 

Contact Achieves Unity
And Wider Participation

By NICK RUFFIN

Last year the Contact symposium
was a success only in the sense that
there had never been a symposium
at Washington and Lee before, and
that to have one at all was an im-
provement over the previous situa-
tion. This year mere existence could
not decide the worth of Contact. The
program improved to achieve an
excellence which his remarkable in
comparison to last year’s effort. Con-
tact had a unity in which the five
speakers supported challenged and
expanded each other's ideas, so that
the whole was surely greater than
the sum of its parts

Attendance Good

Attendance must be judged good
in comparison with last year’s pro-
gram. Still many students and fae-
ulty did net participate. This is un-
fortunate, for Contact demonstrated
that a small, liberal arts college iso-
lated from the centers of decision
and action can maintain an aware-
ness of and a relevance in our so-
ciety. This involvement in the world,
which is necessary if our thought
is to have meaning, is too often over-
looked in the academic program

Contact
many of the most severe problems
facing the United States today. Most
important Contact presented a chal-

presented and examined

lenge in ideas. I think that Wash-
ington and Lee sullers from a ple-
thora of tradition and an affluent
and normally self-satisfied student
body, but in addition, we have a con-
ventional, homegenous faculty. The
ferment and exchange which pro-
duce a fruitful dialogue are temper-

ed and starved by a lack of variety

Law School Support

tionate numbers came from the Law

Jack Rebbins | ably be apple d to th prolessors of

 

the two schools as well. One often
hears the complaint that the world
is run by lawyers. Those who com-
plain also must be willing to act.

I understand that few professors
encouraged their students to attend
Contact. Some may have thought
that their students would be in-
formed of the program without an
announcement from the professors.
Others may have been unwilling to
damage their reputations by sup-
porting a program whose success
was not guaranteed. I hope that Con-
tact will receive stronger support
in the future.

Finally a note about the sponsors
of Contact, the fraternities. The IFC
pays for Contact beyond what por-
tion of the expense paid through par-
ents’ contributions (parents contrib-
uted over $1000; fraternity members

will bay 2.00-$3.00 each: total
$2800-$3000). Contract is a worth-
while project, and the fraternities

should be commended for their sup-
port

But the fraternities actually have
as much right to claim eredit for
Contact as a tax payer does to
claim credit for a National Park.
The IFC banned combo parties for
the Contact weekend but certain fra-
SAE and PEP,
scheduled iniatiation ceremonies for
weekend. At least one

Freshman Billy Ball came up with two firsts, including a

record-shattering performance

to lead the water-bound Generals to a 57-38 victory over Loy-

ola of Baltimore.
Ball went 2

of

copped first in the individual med-
ley.
Pat Costello turned his best per-

formance yet. He won the breast
stroke at 2:19.1, and was a key man
in the effort by the medley team

which fell .3 short of a pool record.
Others swimming the medley were
Nelson Head, Bill Wildrick, and Joe
Huston.

Wildrick, giving his usual strong
performance, also picked up a first
in the butterfly, touching out Bill
Clay.

Other firsts were snagged by Noel
Clinnard in diving and Ned Law-
rence in the 500 yard free style
Freshman Parker Moore picked up
two seconds in the 50 and 100 yard

Loyola unfortunately neglected to

their wins by forfeit, taking W&L
to an early 10-0 lead

The soap spera question of the day

“Can the erratic, radical, politi-
cal columnist find peace and success
as sports editor? Stay tuned.

Some changes are going ‘to be
made. For instance, W&L sports
is going to appear on this page. In
defiance of over sixty years of
Ring-tum Phi tradition, some at-
tention will be paid to accuracy.

Last, the new editor has no inten-
tion of coaching the teams of these
confines. Again, this is going against
heavy tradition. However, the editor
is a well known iconoclast any way.
Hopefully, his personal prejudices
for the football team, the Big Ten,
the Delts, and Samantha Eggar will |

not come through too often.

Spring practice is confined, gen-

coach Mac plans to do some offensive
experimentation. He will be spending

before the last two games and the
CAC tournament.

Hampden-Sydney

Hampden-Sydney comes to Lex-
ington tonight sporting a second
place in the tough Mason-Dixon
Conference. A win against the Ti-
gers will put the Generals in a posi-
tion to make a strong showing in
the CAC tournament Feb. 24-26. But
Coach Canfield is not taking the last
regular season opponent—Emory
and Henry—lightly. Although they
haven’t won a lot of ball games, they
will bring a scrappy ball club to
Lexington Friday night. The Gen-
erals have their work cut out for
them and two victories would give
them a 10-12 record—the best since
the ’58 season and W&L’s all-Am-
erican Dom Flora.

Notes:

With his 16 points against East-
ern Mennonite Rob Bauer became
the first freshman in 11 years to
score over 300 points in a season,
The last to do it was Dom Flora in
1955. Bauer’s 306 points give him an
average of 16.1 points per game
which leads the team. Frank Morri-
son is the only other General in
double figures with a 13.5 average.
The other three starters, Jody Kline,
John Carrere, and Bob Spessard are
bunehed together between 9 and 10
points a game.

Generals Average 74

W&L at present is averaging 74
points a game while giving up 79
points a game on defense. Since the
first two games when their oppon-
ents scored over 100 points, the
Generals have not allowed any team
to reach that level. Certainly, one
can see the giant strides Coach Can-
field has made in W&lL’s basketball

three escapes but trailed his oppon-

giving Loyola its only points by de-

Jay Clark, 177 lb., narrowly missed
his pin in the third period, but led
his opponent in points by a near-
fall and two minutes of riding time,
giving W&L another decision.

Wrestling his first match of the
season, heavywegiht Warren Stewart
completely conquered his opponent.
He gained a take-down and a near-
fall in the first period and a reverse,
near-fall, and predicament in the
second. He delivered the coup de
grace by pinning his man two min-
utes into the third period, bringing
the final total to 36-3.

After going down to defeat last
week at the hands of Duke and
North Carolina State, Coach Miller’s
words were indeed appropriate: “It’s
great to be back on the winning
road!”

much of it.” He pointed out that in
cities today we develop no distine-
tive architectural styles of our own
because tradition is sacrificed for ef-
ficiency. He went on to say that Ex-
cessive social functionalism is a
problem with most cities today. That
is, that business areas are separate
from residential areas, art areas
from business areas so that “each
part of the town is only half a life.”

He went on to discuss the problem
of slums and stated that since, as
long as income is unequally distrib-
uted, there will always be one group
which is poorer (and naturally will
have poorer housing), and since
there is a growing trend toward ur-
banization, the prospect is for more
slums in the next 100 years.

His final subject was the push
to the suburbs. A crucial result of
this, he said, is the increased prob-
lem of transportation, which results
in the influx of tremendous num-
bers of automobiles into the city.
This problem, he felt, could be rem-
edied either by prohibiting cars from
large cities, or by placing a prohibi-
tive tax (such as $1500) on all cars
used in the city.

He concluded that the problem in
a developing city is that each per-
son strives for his desires and suf-
fers from everyone else’s striving.
He said that a situation arises where
“everyone can do what he wishes
and none can get what he wants.”

Dr. Jay T. Wright

On Saturday afternoon Dr. Jay T.
Wright presented a paper on the
plight and condition of education in
an increasingly urbanized American
society. Dr. Wright, a psychologist,
educator, and minister from Pitts-
burgh, paid particular attention to
the situation at small rurally locat-
ed colleges such as Washington and
Lee.

In modern America, Dr. Wright
said that colleges outside of urban
centers would have to maintain the
ideal of a liberal education while
urban schools became predominately
technical. The recent bill passed by
the Virginia legislature to establish
15 technical junior colleges was cited
as proof of the tendency toward
technical education.

Dr. Wright said that urbanization

would increase and that the small
college by nurturing tolerance could
make a positive contribution to Am-
erican society.

To aid this process Dr. Wright ad-
vocated acceptance of Negro appli-
cants and foreign students.

Dr. Wright also stated that a cam-
pus should have at least one com-
munist on the faculty to forment in-
tellectual debate and controversy.

After his address Dr. Wright was
questioned by Prof. Van Den Haag,
Mr. James Boatwright, and Dr.
Charles W. Barritt.

Highlighting the CONTACT week-
end, noted writer Claude Brown,
author of Manchild in the Promised
Land, discussed the inherent prom-
lems of the Negro ghettos in the
urban area,

Initially, Brown focused his atten-
tion on the “Harlems” of such urban
centers as Detroit, Chicago, New
York and Los Angeles. He observed
that the Negro communities in the
large cities are populated with peo-
ple who lack education and who
cannot articulate their grievances.
“Anyone with money, anyone who is
respectable, anyone who is doing
good, in short the Establishment, is
their enemy,” commented Brown.

Exploring the racial situation in
New York City, the speaker stated
that the people of Harlem are gener-
ally disallusioned with politics. He
expressed hope for the success of the
proposed reforms advocated by re-
cently-elected Mayor John Lind-
say, but conceded that Lindsay will
have to “buck” the established pow-
er structure if he is to effect a
change.

Commenting that not even the
“black bourgeoisie” comprehended
the plight of the Negro in the ghet-
to, Brown summarized the primary
problems. “You can’t get anybody
who really understands the ghetto
to do something about them, for they
have no power.”

Brown concluded his talk with a
discussion of contemporary racial
problems on a national level. View-
ing the racial question as an “evolv-
ing problem,” the speaker stated that
the Negro is “no longer willing to
accept his situation passively.”

He disclaimed the effect of Mar-
tin Luther King’s non-violent ap-
proach to Civil Rights.

By CHIP TOLBERT
ESQUIRE’S FASHION EDITOR

   

CALLING ON THE BOARD! In order to set our 1966 campus

fashion reports in the proper perspective, we called upon members
of Esquire’s 1965 College Advisory Board to bring us up to date
on what’s being worn on campuses North, East, South and West
this winter. What regional fashion shifts occur as you move about
the country? How does the casual attire worn in the West, for
example, differ from that worn in the East? And which fashion
trends seem most likely to spread out to other areas of the country?
For some authoritative answers, read on...

THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH, according to
Michael Mains, University of Arizona ’65,
there’s a brisk traffic in lightweight conserva-
tive suits with the dash of color supplied largely
in neckwear. Striped ties predominate, but
foulards are moving in again, Everybody wears
button-downs, and the three-piece suit is in-
frequently seen on campus. In the mornings,
when there’s apt to be a chill in the air, a
sweater worn with a button-down sport shirt
and wheat jeans is sufficiently warm and in-
formal enough for class. Heather-toned sweaters
hold the edge, and corduroy jeans or wash-and-
wear khakis complete the casual scene, In foet-
wear, a wing tip properly complements a suit,
while saddle shoes or loafers are a standard part
of the informal picture,

SWINGING NORTH, Richard Gentry, Jr., University of Michigan,

tells us that for north-country winters the rugged toggle coats are
serviceable and popular. Above the knee lengths are what every-
one’s wearing. Here, the accent falls heavily on the informal touch:
V-neck sweaters in solid colors; button-downs, both plain and
striped; tapered corduroys and wheat jeans; and a solid serving
of loafers and chukka boots, For fraternity parties and other social
events, plaid sport jackets are beginning to make the scene. Her-
ringbone and heather sport jackets lead the field, but big patterns
are beginning to make some headway. In neckwear, there’s a trio
of popular entries: stripes, club figures and paisleys. Semiformal
slacks are usually tapered flannel, and loafers or wing-tip shoes go
best with the sport jacket and slacks.

WAY OUT WEST, at Berkeley, Scott Gregg in-

forms us that one of the unique features on
his campus is the colored sneaker. Perhaps this
is a manifestation of Berkeley's celebrated pen-
chant for innovation. Beyond that, the fashion
picture, both in casual and dressy attire, follows
patterns familiar throughout the rest of the
country’s campuses, V-neck sweaters predomi-
nate, with crew necks a close second. Sport
shirts appear ina wide, but not necessarily wild,
variety of patterns and colors. Madras is the
outer limit. Permanent press casual slacks and
blue jeans are In in the casual order of things.
Herringbone, hound’s-tooth, and heather mix-
tures complete the sport jacket picture, with

     

\ ? greens and grays the most popular colors in the
tapered slacks which are worn with the jacket.
Colored or pin stripe button-downs and diagonal-striped ties (plus

 

\

loafers) round out the accessories picture.

ON THE EASTERN SEABOARD, the big thing,

according to John Lamb, Jr. of Princeton, is
boots. Everybody seems to be wearing them
with informal clothing especially during the
winter months, for they obviate the need for
rubbers or galoshes. Ski jackets are now stan-

 

dard apparel as are heather crew-neck sweaters, Subdued, dark
colors rule the sport jacket scene. Worn with them are colored or
striped button-downs and repp ties. Moving over to the casual side
of the wardrobe, dark-colored flannel slacks give way to severely
tapered trousers, For dress up occasions, smooth leather loafers or
wing tips; for casualwear, brushed leather loafers or chukka boots,

NEXT MONTH the Old Order passes to make way for the New
ESQUIRE’s recently-elected 1966 College Advisory Board will be
preparing to head for New York to help us authenticate the newest
campus fashion trends and innovations. See you then.

EC Evaluates Assimilation Committee

 

Griffin Discusses
Rush Books, Lists

(Editor’s Note: The IFC, which seems finally to have
found itself, has made an unusual amount of news during the
last few weeks, as sponsor of CONTACT as well as for its
often-controversial legislation on rush booklets, controls on
fraternity treasurers, and the recent ban of separate Jewish
and non-Jewish lists. IFC President Chuck Griffin comments
on some of these.)

Q. The proposal recently made before the IFC to replace
individual fraternity rush booklets with a single IFC rush book
has come under heavy fire. Why do you support this move?

A: The fraternities together spend about $12,000 on rush
booklets each year (including
the IFC booklet). To have a
combined booklet would mean
an annual savings of about
$9500. In the first place, these
figures are way out of propor-
tion—the cost is not justified.
Secondly, I don’t know of a
single fraternity that wouldn’t
benefit significantly from a sav-
ings such as this. Thirdly, since
the resulting decrease in a fra-
ternity’s exposure to incoming
freshmen would be reduced
equally with other fraterni-
ties, there is no relative change
in any one fraternity’s particu-
lar advantage.

Q: How would a standard IFC book be put together?

A: Plans have not been determined for any specific format.
However, the general idea is that a house would be given a
particular number of pages (equal for all houses) which
would be determined by the houses together, and then each

 

fraternity would be free to plan its own format—within reason-
able costs, since formats can differ as to price.

Q: Do you feel that a common rush booklet would —
to favor large, nationally-known fraternities over those less
well-known?

A: No I do not. There are several reasons. Primarily, my
reason stands on the ground that any resulting disadvantage
or advantage would be real.
ized proportionately by all
fraternities. The argument has
been advanced that a less-well
known fraternity needs an indi-
vidual rush booklet in order to
become better known. This is
not a valid argument, since the
booklets of less-well known fra-
ternities were in competition
with those of the better-known
fraternities. As a freshman
received the usual “mass” of
rush booklets, in mixed order
(e.g., first from a less-
known fraternity, and then one
from a beter-known fraternity,
and so on), he gradually lost
interest in reading them. The only way a less-known fraternity
could achieve an advantage under the present system is by
either getting its booklet out first, or by sending out a “spectac-
ular” rush booklet. Since all houses realize these two oppor-
tunities, even this is cancelled out in competition.

Q: Won't a common rush book with a limited scope for
creativity in layout, be less interesting and therefore less read
than the present booklets, which do not look alike?

A: Yes and no, They would be less interesting, since there

one

would obviously have to be a degree of uniformity between
the various fraternities. They would not be less read, I believe.
because the rushee would have all the houses before him under
(unlike the IFC booklet) would be
different, thus enabling the freshman to compare whatever

To Circulate
Viet Petition

Campus Young Republicans have
taken sharp issue with present ad-
ministration policy on Vietnam.

On Monday night the W&L Young
Republican Club executive commit-
tee unanimously endorsed a petition
proposed by the Clarence J. Brown
(Law School) Young Republican
Club calling for a course of action
which would carry the war to North
Vietnam with the aim of winning it
as quickly as posible

The petition will be circulated on
campus by the two clubs beginning
today and continuing through next
week. It reads as follows:

We the undersigned, believe that
to secure unconditional freedom
for the people of South Vietnam,
to repel Communist aggression, to
minimize American and Vietna-
mese casualties, and to bring about
a swift and stable peace, the United
States should, as suggested by
members of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and both Houses of Con-
Kress:

1) impose a Kenendy-like quar-
antine on North Vietnam:

2) carry the war to North Viet-
nem by maximum use of Ameri-
can conventional air power against
significant military targets—sup-
ply routes, industrial complextes,

power plants, and port facilities;
and
1) allow no privileged sanctu-
aries along the main routes of in-
filtration, particularly the He Chi

The EC launched into its second
semester program Tuesday night in
a meeting which covered various
topics, including the upcoming NSA
referendum, a report on relaxing the
rules against girls in thedorms, and
an interview with members of the
assimilation and student control
committees.

As a part of a program of general
review of committees, ‘their useful-
ness, and their success, the BC
interviewed Sam Frazier, chairman
of the assimilation committee, and
taree other members of the
committee. All expressed some dis-
satisfaction with the committee’s
success.

According to their statements, only
five meetings have been held during
the present year, at which a total of
25 persons were dealt with on vio-
lations of conventional dress. One
committee member stated that he
had personally filled out cards on
at least thirty students, some of
whom were apparently never
brought before the committee.

Another criticism made by com-
mittee members was that the com-

Peace Corps
Discussed By
Ex-Members

Last night in duPont Hall Miss
Gloria Clark and Mr. Meredith Mac-
Kusick spoke about their experiences
as members of the Peace Corps.
Miss Clark, a native of Martinsville,
Virginia, and a graduate of Carson-
Newman, served for two years in
Colombia, South America. Here it
was her duty to educate the people
to better health habits. Mr. Mac-
Kusick, a graduate of Antioch, was
stationed in Liberia for two years
and taught economies and worked in
business administration.

In answering questions after their
talks, Miss Clark and Mr. Mac-
Kusick both agreed that the greatest
asset of the Peace Corps, besides the
giving of oneself for a worthy cause,
is the great responsibility of a work-
er has. A Peace Corps worker must
make important decisions on his own.
They also emphasized that the larg-
est percentage of workers are liber-
al arts graduates without technical
experience. However, everyone is put
through a comprehensive training
program lasting from 8 to 14 weeks.
In this period all the necessary skills
and languages are taught to the vol-
unteers.

To enter the Peace Corps, the
prospective candidate should take
the Peace Corps exam about nine
months before he wants to get in.
Once the test is administered, it is
sent to Washington and processed
within two months. If the candidate
qualifies, he is invited to train for
a specific job chosen for him by
virtue of his skills and preferences

Corps may be obtained from Dr.

(Continued from page 1)
the IFC at its next meeting, do you foresee any further at-
tempts to limit spending on rush booklets?

A: This I don’t know. It seems to me that spending for
rush week in general is far too high. Fraternities could save
themselves a lot of money if they would just agree to do so.
$1500-$2000 is quite a bit to pay for a new crop of pledges—
it works out to about $100 per pledge. I dare say that every
fraternity man would be very happy to have $100 given to him
tomorrow or at least $50.

If the motion fails to pass, I would certainly hope that the
fraternities would continue to seek out new ways to save costs
on rush week. My motive is not primarily to stop individual
rush booklets, rather, it is to reduce some of the mammoth
expenditures on rush week.

Q: Mr. Richard Fletcher, a Sigma Nu national officer, has
been invited to speak at the IFC-faculty next Tuesday night.
What is the purpose of this?

A: Mr. Fletcher is a very able man, with a lot of insight.
He states our particular problems in a way that is extremely
accurate and concrete. I think that his message will help the
fraternity leaders a great deal.

Q: Does his invitation to speak indicate that the IFC is
going to begin a campaign to solve some of its basic problems?

A: I would hope that the IFC is always trying to solve its
basic problems. In this respect, my answer is no. However, a
formal study of ourselves would have a great deal of merit,
and I would like to see Mr. Fletcher motivate the fraternity
presidents into such action.

Q: Do you think that Contact went over as well as ex-
pected?

A: A program of this type takes time to establish itself and
achieve a fair degree of success. I think that for its second
year, Contact went over very well. The student participation,
although it was reported to have been 61 per cent, is still low.
It seems that attendance by 85 per cent of the student body
would not be unrealistic at all. I think that the Co-Chairmen
did an excellent job after they got started—atlhough they did
get started rather late.

Q: Do you think Contact should be continued, and if so,
should the IFC continue to sponsor it?

A: It is not a question of whether or not to support or
continue it. The IFC passed an amendment to its constitution
last Spring which includes four points: 1) The IFC shall spon-
sor a Contact symposium every year except those of Mock
Convention (this is nota direct quote—only parahrased) .2)
The Chairman or Chairmen shall be selected by the Judicial
Board of the 163 along with the advice of the previous chair-
man. 3) “The IFC will assume responsibility for any debt incur-
redby Contact, after all other means of revenue have been ex-
hausted.”” 4) The IFC shall have a representative on the steer-
ing committee. Thus, Contact will be continued indefinitely.

Q: It is generally understood that Contact ran into a large

deficit this year. How great is this deficit and should there be
any problem covering it?
A: The deficit should be somewhere in the neighborhood
of $1500.00. There should be no problem collecting this
money from the houses on a pro-rated basis. For those that
will accuse the IFC of not having exhausted all means of reven-
ue, I must argue the point.

Our greatest appeal was to the parents of fraternity men.
I expect that most of these men did not specifically mention
the appeal to their parents. Thus, it will be hard to convince me
that we have not done all we can—primarily because each
fraternity man had (and still has, by the way) an opportunity
to solicit contributions from his parents.

Incidently, assuming there are close to 800 fraternity men,
a contribution of $5 per set of parents would bring $4000.00
of revenue—enough to run this year’s and next year’s sum-
posiums. As it was, we received contributions totaling approx:
imately $1,000—at an average of $50 a contribution. This
means that so far, 20 people have supported Contact financi-
ally. As a result of this poor response from the parents, I have
no qualms about assessing the houses.

Viet Symposium Urged

 

 

 

 

 

By NORMAN GLASSMAN
WEL Law Student

Since with each transpiring day
the world finds that by significant
inerements it is closer to destruc-
tion, a “Vietnam Symposium” is
hereby proposed. The Symposium
would center around the historical
background, the Communist “threat,”
and the various moral and legal eon-
siderations involved.

Due to the complexity of the issues
and to the alarming position we
find ourselves in, one is chagrined to
note how the student body and fac-
ulty ean sign petitions egging on
the President, without being aware
of how the war commenced. Is the
silence of the faculty to be inter-
pretated as a lack of courage, or is
it perhaps the “don't rock the boat”
attitude which permeates the Uni-
versity? One must wonder how this
effect” is condoned when
holocaust is an imminent

istrich

nuclear

 

possibility. If the state of affairs
I've outlined is in fact mythical, if
the faculty is in fact courageous,
then one must inferentially conclude
from their prolonged silence that
their knowledge of Vietnamese poli-
ties and history is in fact nonexistent

It is most appropriate that this
dialogue be set up within the Uni-
versity framework, for it is the uni-
versity community which can best
support the free (and analytical)
exchange of ideas. In fact, it ls ob-
ligatory for the administration and
faculty to forment such a student-
to-teacher, student-to-student ex-
change. For the University to ignore
this duty, is to derogate from its
most noble role.

It would be most unfortunate if
we allowed the spirit of CONTACT
to die. It would be disastrous for us
to allow the passage of one year's
time and only then allow it to raise
its head in an orgy of intellectualiam

 

Federal Administration, Economic Pressure
Hinder Public School Integration In South

By LIN HARTIN

On May 17, 1954, almost eleven
years ago, the Supreme Court of
the United States handed down a
unanimous decision in the case of
Brown vy. Topeka Board of Educa-
ton which declared that school seg-
regation on the basis of race was
unconstitutional. For the first few
years after the su-
preme court de-
cision, school inte-
gration was the
main theme of
the civil rights
movement. School
integration was
the cause of the
first major racial
incident in Little
Rock in 1957. It
was to this move-
ment that many
responsible Negro and white citizens
dedicated their efforts.

In the past year or so, however,
the problem of school integration,
though still of major significance,
has been pushed into the background
by seemingly more serious civil rights
problems. It has been generally
thought that the inevitable had at
last been accepted and the nation
could turn to more pressing civil
rights problems.

This was especially the case after
the passage of the Civil Rights Act of
1964. This act gave the administra-
tion a powerful weapon to use in
enforcing compliance with the 1954
court decision in that it provided that
federal aid of all kinds would be
cut off from individual school sys-
tems that did not comply with the
court decision. This was a most im-
portant step in that it relieved the
judiciary of the responsibility of en-
forcing the Supreme Court decision,
a responsibility which the courts
have borne alone since 1954. As Mr.
Justice Black stated in a fifth cir-
cuit decision last July, “By the 1964
Act, and the action of the Depart-
ment of Health, Education, and Wel-
fare, administration of the law is
largely where it ought to be—in the
hands of the executive and its agen-
cies with the function of the judi-
ciary confined to those rare cases
presenting justifiable, not operation-
al questions.” The process of bring-
ing individual suits in the courts to
end segregation was painfully slow,
but the 1964 Act provided a much
faster and more efficient method.

In a Special Report published last
fall, the Southern Regional Council,
a highly respected, private civil
rights research agency based in At-
lanta, considered how the new law
was being carried out and come to
some rather gloomy conclusions. The
Administration depends on the US.
Office of Education for the informa-
tion that it needs on desegregation
to enforce the 1964 Act. The first
problem lies here, for the S.R.C.
found that up to this point the Of-
fice of Education has not been suffi-
ciently staffed to carry out its tre-
mendous new duties.

The present staff is dedicated
enough, but too overworked to do

the job as efficiently as it should be
done. The blame for this lies clearly
with the administration and Congress
and certainly steps should be taken
at once to correct this problem.
Because the Office of Education is
understaffed it is extremely limited
in its investigation of desegregation
in the South. Generally, the office
has had to be satisfied with individ-
ual statements from school systems.
While some systems probably were
honest and above board with the
Office, on the whole it is too much
to expect that the majority of the
school systems would volunteer ac-
curate information if they could
avoid doing it. Indeed, when the

 

S.R.C. conducted its investigation of |
desegregation, it found the Office of
Education figures to be considerable
in error.

In their effort, the research de-
partment received help from the US.
Office of Education, the Southern
Education Reporting Service, state
Councils on Human Relations and
other organizations. They also used
newspaper reports of their own field
investigators. In Alabama, for ex-
ample, they found that only 717
Negroes attended integrated schools
while the Office of Education's figures
indicated that 15,300 Negroes at-
tended integrated schools. In North
Carolina the Office of Education
figure was three times larger than
that of the Southern Regional Coun-

 

 

cil.

On the whole, the S.R.C. Gover |
ered that the Office of Education had
overestimated the number of Ne-
groes in integrated schools by some
60 thousand and that today only 5.2
per cent of the South’s Negro chil-
dren attend integrated schools. “The
truth is,” the report states, “that
nearly ninety-five per cent of the
South’s Negro pupils are still trapped
in segregated and unequal schools.
The false impression is due largely
to attempts by the state and local
federal authorities and perhaps some
feleral officials to imply that school
systems were desegregated beyond
mere tokenism.

In carrying its investigation furth-

“mere tokenism”

er, the S.R.C. discovered that much
of the so called desegregation that
has taken place has been under the
guise of “freedom of choice.” This
policy gives students living in a
particular school district the right
to request a transfer to any school
in that district and sometimes to
schools in neighboring districts.
Negro children could supposedly
transfer to all white schools if they
wished.

First, this policy is a clear viola-
tion of the guideline set down by
the Office of Education which which
states, “The responsibility to elimi-
nate segregation rests with the
school authorities and is not satis-
fied by rules and practices which
shift the burden of removing dis-

Per Cent of Negroes

of persons previously discriminated
against.”

Secondly, the S.R.C. discovered
that in districts where “freedom of
choice” is the policy, both economic
and physical pressure is put upon
the Negroes who try to have their
children transferred to white schools.
A rather extreme example of this
is the case of Crawfordville, Georgia
which made the headlines for several
days last fall. White children were
all transferred out of Taliaferro
County schools to all-white schools
in neighboring counties. This policy
soon bankrupted the school system.
When Negroes protested one Negro
principal, five Negro teachers, two

       

Negro bus drivers, two Negro cooks,
two Negro custodians in addition to
twenty-two Negro parents of chil-
dren were fired from their jobs.
Also, six Negro families were evicted
and four faced sudden foreclosures.

What can and must be done to
solve this serious problem? First, as
I suggested earlier the Office of
Education must be given a larger
staff and more funds, the means to
carrying out its new duties. Second,
the Office of Education must stop ac-
cepting “freedom of choice” inter-
gration without careful investiga-
tion. Last, as the St. Petersburg
Times put it on October 16, 1965,
“The next step in the civil rights
struggle is to deny to those who still
shout ‘Never!’ the economic weap-
ons long used against Negroes and

 

crimination to the class or classes

tested anew at Crawfordville.”

 

Letters To The Editor

IFC Refutes Lee, Students Call For Vietnam Victory

IFC Answers Lee Column

On Wednesday, February 2, the
Interfraternity Council debated the
“Jewish list” question. At the end of
this discussion, the fraternity presi-
dents voted to discontinue the prac-
tice of distributing dual lists of in-
coming freshmen. In the past, it has
been possible to distinguish between
Jewish and non-Jewish students by
means of the dual lists.

On Tuesday, Febrary 8, Mr. Rob-
ert Lee presented a column in the
Ring-tum Phi on this action. The
following is a statement in response
to Mr. Lee's views, written at the
unanimous encouragement of the
LFC Judicial Board.

Lee's Criticiam

The motives of the IFC's “enlight-
ened leadership” are two-fold. First,
these people wish to do away with
unreasonable  diserimination in
whatever form it may take. Second-
ly, it is the desire of the Judicial
Board to further and protect the
interests of the fraternities, both im-
mediately within our own academic
community, and in our relationship
with the outside world, With re-
gard to the first motive, I must ad-
mit that the IFC has been in the
wrong—indeed, to an unjustified ex-
tent. We do not ask to be excused

for our past poor judgment and
sense of values; however, we do
ask for the opportunity to be able

to recognize these faults and correct
them without being laheled hypre-
crites

 

The Judical Board has not changed
its position with respect to the sec-
ond motive. We have attempted to
protect the interests of fraternities
in the past, and will continue to do
so in the future. These motives are
best illustrated by a history of the
“Jewish list”

Last spring, the IFC was attempt-
ing to support both of these motives,
We faced two problems: On the one
hand, if one list was issued, then
we would have been discriminating
against the “Jewish” fraternities, one
of which claimed it needed them
most and was one of the strongest
advocates of dual lists. Thus, the dis-
crimination problem reached a stale-
mate. This, we estimate, brought
in several votes in favor of dual
lists.

External Problem

On the other hand, we were faced
with an external problem. At the
time, there were several chapters
at other schools which were receiv-
ing criticisms for discriminatory
clauses from several groups, includ-
ing their respective administrations
‘eg. Stanford—Sigma Chi). Added
to this problem was pressure from
the national offices of fraternities to
atick by the restrictive clauses or
face the alternative of having their
charter taken away. Thus, the IFC
felt that it would not have been

 

in the best interests of either the
University or the houses so affected!
by such clauses, to invite the same
kind of attention from pressure
groups, national officers, and news

media. This problem also brought
several votes in favor of dual lists
Together, enough votes were cast to
continue the use of dual lists.

However, times DO change. Little
by little, each of these problems was
overcome, The “enlightened leaders”
of the IFC investigated the problems
of the national attacks on local chap-
ters, with specific attention given the
Stanford-Sigma Chi case. Leaders of
the national officers of Sigma Chi
were contacted personally at the Na-
tional Interfraternity Conference
shortly before Christmas, and we
learned that the problem is virtually
solved——at least to the extent that
it would hurt a chapter on our cam-
pus. It was discovered that all a
chapter has to do is challenge its
national offices, and the fraternity
leaders became quiet, rather quick-
ly

With regard to our internal prob-
lem, the Judicial Board discussed the
lista with the two “Jewish” houses
before the motion to do away with
dual lists was presented to the IFC
Finally, about a month ago, the
Judicial Board received a directive
from the Student Affairs Commit-
tee that the IFC look at the problem
of dual lists, and make a recommen-
dation to the committee as to what
action should be taken, if any

Given these changes, the Judicial

issue such as this. If so, Mr. Lee's
accusations have some validity. How-
ever, the Judicial Board recognizes
that many forces are at play in an
issue such as this one, and that
groups of people are neither able nor
desirous of reacting immediately to
the views of any idealist; rather, the
practical factors must be considered,
It is relatively easy to read, think,
discuss, and expound upon high
ideals—very difficult to implement
them. The IFC is trying. As we try,
Mr. Lee, why don't you try a little

patience—that also is a virtual ideal,
We of the Judical Board know
that as Mr. Lee read this state-

ment he found out the facts of the
issue for the first time. His article
last week was a grand display of
ignorance—and a few quotations
taken significantly out of context.

Team To Play E&H
In Last Home Game

By RON KESSLER |
Washington and Lee’s struggling |
but improving basketball team lost a
tough one Wednesday night to
Hampden-Sydney College, 78-66.
Sparked by the fine play of Jody
Kline, the Generals contained Hamp-
den-Sydney throughout most of the
game; however, a couple of bad
passes and an effective Tiger half-
court press resulted in the loss,
According to coach Verne Canfield,
“We could have given them a closer
game. We expected that half-court
press, but their defense still accom-
pished what they wanted. Jody
Kline played the finest game we've }
seen since he’s been at W&L.” Kline
had 19 points, seven rebounds, and
seven team high for the
season.

assists—a

The game was unquestionably an
improvement over last year’s en-
counter with the same team, which
the Generals lost 117-77. High scorer
for the game was H-S’s Dyer with
21, followed by teammate Quarles
with 20. Also in double figures for
the Generals besides Kline were Rob
Bauer with 13 and Earl Edwards
with 10.

Tonight the Generals meet Emory
and Henry in the final home game
of the year, in Doremus Gym at
8:00. Despite a mediocre record, the
E&H squad is young and explosive;
they’ve had a tough schedule and
have played several close games.

Canfield says of the visitors that

 

“if they get hot they can explode.

Flora in 1955. Flora went on to make
All-American as a senior.

Bauer leads in both field goals
and free throws with 109 and 88 re-®
sepctively, followed by junior Frank
Morrison, who has 84 field goals and
61 charity tosses for a total of 229
points. Morrison also leads the team
in shooting percentage with 49 per
cent while Earl Edwards follows with
45.3 per cent.

Jody Kline tops the list in free
throw percentage, hitting 42 of 59
for a 71.2 average. Bauer is second

City Unique, Says Bensinger Thankfully

Matmen Face

Old Dominion;
10th Event Set

Last year a wrestling match had
eight individual matches. This year
it’s nine. But tomorrow night it will
be ten, as the Washington and Lee
varsity wrestling team takes on Old
Dominion College.

Coach Dick Miller has agreed
with the Monarch’s coach to wrestle
ten men, adding a 191 pound class
in order to wrestle at all posisble
weights, spanning the big gap be-
tween 177 and heavyweight.

Miller, in predicting a “real tough”
match, added that Old Dominion is
exceptionally strong from 130 to 160.
Hogue, Ragland, Cleveland, Harris,
and Cote thus far this year have
compiled an excellent record.

W&L, which has only one winne
back from last year’s 17-11 loss, is
probably going to swich the usual
starting line-up around.

Either Rolly Jacobs or Jim Bru-
ton will go at 123, with the other
getting the nod at 130. Kem White,
co-captain, will wrestle at 137, while
Don Paterson goes at 145.

Charlie Slaughter is the 152 choice
and will be followed by either co-
captain Jamie Andrew or Bob Mun-
son at 160, the other following at
167.

Jay Clarke is the starter at 177,
and Warren Stewart and Holmes
Raker will fill 191 and heavyweight,
though which one will go first is still
undecided.

The Generals, holding a 4-3 season
record, must win either against Old
Dominion or U.Va. next Saturday in
order to finish above .500 for the
year.

Swimmers Go To D.C.

Coach Norris Eastman’s varsity
swim team (this may or not be an
“in” joke) left this afternoon for
a weekend trip to Washington, D.C

The tankmen will face American
University tonight at 8. The Eagles,
who traditionally have a strong team,
defeated East Carolina earlier this
season, while W&L lost to the Pir-

ates last week.

Tomorrow the Generals face
Georgetown at 2 p.m. Coach East-

man, who is taking a large, injury-
free squad, anticipates strong com-
petition in both meets.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Jeffress And Steinger Argue
Against ‘No Girls In Dorm’ Law

(Continued from Page 1)

sibility of revoking or modifying the
rules against girls in the dormitories.
In a statement issued to the Ring-
tum Phi, they stated:

“ ..We have taken a survey of
social controls at comparable insti-
tutions throughout the country. The
results of this survey, which brought
us information on sixteen schools,
showed that all private, nondenomi-
national schools surveyed except two
(Bowdoin and Columbia) allow girls
in men’s dormitories during speci-
fied hours of the week. Schools in
this category include Amherst, Trin-
ity, Williams, and Wesleyan as well
as most of the Ivy League schools... .
Our situation, while similar to that
of these other schools, is indeed
unique, and our solution to the prob-
lem must deal with our political con-
ditions.

“It is the sad truth that the city
(2!) of Lexington on a Saturday
night has little better to offer than
Doc’s and the Pit. Thus, with the
exception of fraternities and apart-
ments, there are extremely slim op-
portunities for social entertainment
in the W&L environment. This void
puts a heavy handicap on the social
life of the non-fraternity men. ...The
present universitiy policy of not al-
lowing girls in the dormitories ef-
fectively excludes independent dor-
mitory residents from a full social

life, which is generally considered
a significant part of the total college
experience.

“We believe that the nature of
the W&L student body warrants
a change in the administration poli-
cy; the W&L student is as intelli-
gent and responsible as the students
at other similar institutions which
grant this privilege....

“The major argument advanced...
is that all dormitory rooms are bed-
rooms, and permission to take girls
into the dormitories would be in ef-
fect university sanction of sex. The
fact is that not every student in
taking a girl to his room has the in-
tention of sexual relations, even
though we admit that such actions
are likely to occur. Nevertheless, is
is not the university’s responsibility
to oversee such personal aspects of
a student’s life....

“Other arguments advanced by the
administration are the invasion of
privacy of other dormitory residents,
the lack of bathroom facilities for
women, and the difficulty in ad-
ministering the restrictions necessary
for the implementation of such a
policy. Although these arguments
have some superficial merit, the
problems they present may be sur-
mounted with little difficulty. In
summary, we believe that this change
is possible, desirable, and necessary,
although we realize that it will be
difficulty to achieve. We therefore,
call on dormitory residents and the
student body in general to actively
support our proposals when it comes
up for consideration.”

Conventional Dress Dying

To the Editor:

There is a considerable difference
between a law which is unenforce-
able, and one which is unenforced.
The current leadership of the Wash-
ington and Lee Assimilation Com-
mittee, from all external appear-
ances, has seen its job in the former
light: enforcing that which is unen-
forceable. Because of this defeatist

attitude, the conventional dress
rules have not been enforced.
The Committee has let it be

known that no student will be as-
similated in the town, or after dark.

Insistence on adherence has retreat-
ed to a feeble request that students
maintain the tradition “at least on
the Hill.” Militancy has departed
the Committee, and with it, what-
ever little efficiency it ever had.

infrequently, establish-
ing vague Committee rules about
assimilating (or not assimilating)
upper-classmen, and in general let-
ting almost every important aspect
of conventional dress disintegrate,
the Assimilation Committee has done
more damage in six months than
warm weather ever did.

The EC. should either abolish the
Committee or more strictly super-
vise it. If conventional dress is to
survive, the latter course must be
taken immediately.

Griffin Interviewed On IFC

(Continued from page 2)

Q: Could you describe briefly the offer from the two CPA
firms in town, made to the IFC?

A: These two firms have presented a proposal to the IFC
that would, in effect, bring about a standardized bookkeeping
system for the fraternities, and would include audits anually
and monthly, on a less thorough basis. Each fraternity would
retain a firm and use this firm for regular consultation.

Q: Do you favor this proposal?

A: Very emphatically. I believe that we would be shocked

if we put all the various systems together and took notice of
some of the very poor accounting methods in use. Given this
program, W&L fraterinties would have one of the soundest
fraternity financial programs in the nation. Many other schools
already have gone under such a program.
Q: When do you expect this program will be initiated?
A: The IFC must give its approval first, of course. The
proposal will be brought to a vote, a constitutional amend-
ment, only after the fraternity presidents and treasurers duly
understand the program and its advantages. This will be
brought about by sessions with representatives of the CPA
firms, fraternity advisors, Dean Atwood, etc.

 

    

FASHIONS

By CHIP TOLBERT
ESQUIRE’S FASHION EDITOR

THE MODS OF LONDON have been responsible for nurturing

some of the most radical and exciting fashion ideas in recent
memory. At the outset, however, let’s make it clear that virtually
none of these fashions are presently being worn on American
campuses. Yet in fashion as in everything else, from extremes
emerge the means, and there’s no doubt that modified versions of
many of these innovations will catch on and be counted among the
best college market sellers in the near future. In any case, we
thought you'd be interested in hearing about what's happening
right now on the London fashion scene, as well as what's being
done in Mod fashions in America.

“SEE YOU IN CARNABY” is the in-phrase among London’s way-

out swingers these days. Almost overnight, Carnaby Street, located
in London's fashionable West End, has become the center and the
source of what the Mods refer to as their “instant fashions.” It’s
an amusing paradox that Carnaby is located a mere 200 yards from
Savile Row, long recognized as headquarters for London’s most
distinguished and conservative tailoring establishments. Who
shops Carnaby? Only the Dave Clark Five, The Rolling Stones, The
Animals, four young men named John, George, Paul and Ringo,
and a fifth who used to be known around town as Anthony Arm-
strong-Jones, And what do they, and thousands of their fans and
followers, buy there? Some pretty surprising fashions...

THE MOD TUXEDO, for a start, offers plenty

of surprises, Cut tight and skinny, it features
a 3 or 4-button jacket, high, narrow lapels, very
deep side vents, satin belt loops, cuffs, and a
wide satin belt. The trousers are tapered in
extremis, and the outfit may be worn with black
demi-boots. Accessories are radical, if not out
rageous: frills on the cuffs and front of the
shirt, plus a very wide bow tie.

THE MOD MODE, in all apparel areas, is char-

acterized by certain definite trends, The ward-
robe is form-fitted, and anything smacking of
standardized fashions is “automatically out.”
The plumage on the male bird is getting
brighter and snappier, and there’s no doubt that
it’s getting harder all the time to tell the boys
apart from the girls. Prices are comparatively
high: slacks run anywhere from $15. to $25.
Lines are fluid, and we frequently find strong surface interest in a
rich variety of textured fabrics, In slacks, the low-rise, hip-hugging
mode! is in. Belts run as wide as three inches, and many of them
are colorfully striped,

MODISM MOVES ON: here are some more “musts” in the fashion-

conscious Mod's wardrobe, A camel suede overshirt with seamed
pockets and shoulders, usually worn with slacks tapered to the knee,
then flared out to bell bottom cuffs. A pair of giant black-and-white
houndstooth check trousers, worn as low as possible. Ticking-
striped low-rise jeans worn with a matching snap-front jacket,
A rugged blue denim shirt with a high-rise collar and cuffs of white
broadcloth, A fancy soft leather vest. The Mod Suit which doubles
as a sports ensemble merely by unbuttoning the suit collar and re-
placing it with a dark collar, And maybe even a black vinyl, double-
breasted jacket with slanting side pockets and patch breast pocket,

SHIRTING THE MOD usually involves wild

prints and even wilder color ideas, Take, for
example, the black daisy shirt, a lightweight
cotton print that also comes in red, purple—the
whole spectrum, in fact—on a white back-
ground, The reverse-print tie is sold along with
the shirt; collars are high-rise, and both cuffs
and collars are white, Way out? On my recent
trip to London, I was assured that it's one of
the current best-sellers! And it’s now being sold

One Hunderd Chapters

Omicron Delta Kappa is an hon-
orary leadership fraternity founded
at Washington and Lee in 1914 for
the purpose of “bringing together
campus leaders in a more relaxed
atmosphere.” Dr. Rupert Latture, re-
tired political science professor, was
one of the founders. In the past
fifty years, chapters or circles have

 

been established in more than one

hundred colleges and _ universities

throughout the country.

ODK’s Purpose
ODK today is dedicated to recog-
nizing superior citizenship and lead-
ership among students, faculty,
and alumni in its chartered educa-
tional institutions. Membership in
ODK is extended only to those stu-
dents who rank in the upper 35
per cent of their class and who have
made significant contributions in
the field of scholarship, athletics,
publications, social and religious af-
fairs, speech, music, and dramatic
arts.
Short Classes
Due to the assembly, Dean Pusey
has announced that there will be
short classes on Wednesday, March
2. Classes will begin at 8:25 a.m. and

 

will run for forty minutes, ending

at 11:45 a.m.
gin at noon.
ODK President

Concerning the selection of Dr.
Charles Phillips as the speaker for
the fifty-first annual assembly, ODK
President Chuck Walker comment-
ed: “We feel that we are bring-
ing to the W&L Student Body a
speaker who in all his fields of en-
deavor fully exemplies the spirit and
the ideals of Omicron Delta Kappa.”

Eminent Educator

Dr. Phillips, who has served as
the President of Bates College since
1944, holds an eminent position in
the field of education. He has re-
ceived honorary degrees from Col-
gate University, Colby College,
Bowdin College, University of Maine,
Western New England College, and
Morehouse College.

Experienced in both the fields of

The assembly will be-

 

administration and teaching, Dr.
Phillips has written or co-authored
five textbooks, including Marketing,
which is currently in its fifth edi-
tion, and Retailing, which is in its
sixth printing.

The popularity of Phillips’ books
is evidenced by the fact that they
are presently being used in more
than six hundred and fifty colleges
and universities throughout the
country.

Dr. Phillips’ selection as speaker
for this year’s Tapping Ceremony
is in keeping with the organization’s
presentation of outstanding speak-
ers. Last year, the address at the
fiftieth anniversary assembly was
delivered by Dr. Samuel Spencer,
President of Mary Baldwin College.
In 1964, the ODK Assembly pre-
sented former W&L President Fran-
cis P. Gaines.

IFC’s Rush Book Proposal

Defeated by Large Majority
In Monday Night Meeting

By STEVE SAUNDERS
News Editor

The IFC Judical Board was hand-
ed a defeat last night when its pro-
posal for a collective rush book-
let for all fraternities was rejected
by all but four houses. Discussion of
ways to reduce the estimated $30,000
annually being spent for rush week
will continue, with the Judical Board
presenting additional recommenda-
tions at the next meeting.

Four Objectives

Billy Cannon, IFC vice president,
spoke for the Judicial Board. He
listed four objectives in rush week
reform: 1.) to reduce expenditures;
2.) to be “fair and equitable” to
every fraternity, preserving the
freedom of each; 3.) to protect the

ODK Considers
NSA And Plans
Formal Debate

By DAVE MARCHESE

Last Monday evening the ODK
Leadership Council, the executive
wing of the recently revamped ODK
Leadership Forum, met for the first
time. The Leadership Council is
composed of the officers of the ODK,
two representatives from the Execu-
tive Committee, one representative
from the IFC and the NFU as well
as the presidents from each of the
law and undergraduate classes.

Briefly, the ODK Leadership For-
um was originally constituted as a
channel of communication, a body
through which student ideas and

 

opinions may be openly and formal- |

ly expressed and debated.

Forum Functions

The Leadership Council serves as
a springboard and screening panel
for any issues which may be of con-
cern to the student body. After such
a review, the council decides wheth-
er the issue in question is worthy
of discussion and debate, and, if so,
forwards it to the Forum which is
an open meeting for students, facul-

At Monday's meeting, the Council
reviewed the recent proposal to have
W&L affiliate with the National
Student Association. The Council
decided that this would serve as an
excellent opportunity for student
debate at the first meeting of the

Forum
YAF
However. since the opposition to
NS.A. affiliation, the Young Amer-

icans for Freedom, has not been able

to attract capable speakers to debate

the N.S.A. representatives at the
Forum meeting. the Council decided
to grant the YAP. a two week ex-
tension

Thus, an arbitrary date, February
28. was set as the deadline in the
YAS efforte to arrange for a
competent speaker. With this date
established, the student body can

ook forward to a formal discussion

to insure that the process of mutual
selection by fraternity and rushee
is safeguarded.

Cannon said that the proposed
IFC collective rush booklet would
run approximately 100 pages and
cost $2500, as opposed to the almost

$12,000 spent on individual rush
booklets by all fraternities.
Other possibilities for reducing

costs include, according to Cannon,
prohibition of serving alcoholic
beverages except during the last
two or three days of rush week; an
increase in the number of open
houses so that each rushee would be
able to see all eighteen fraternities.
These and other proposals, IFC pres-
ident Chuck Griffin announced,
would written up, sent to the fra-
ternities, and discussed next week.

Other Business

In other actions, Barry Vaught
announced that a meeting for all
fraternity treasures and presidents
will be held on Thursday night, at
7 p.m. in duPont Auditorium to dis-
cuss the proposed use of local ac-
countats to regularly audit fraterni-
ty financial records.

CONTACT ‘67

A report from CONTACT co-
chairman Phil Claxton was received,
listing the current CONTACT defi-
cit as $1150. Fraternities will be as-
sessed on a pro-rate basis, as pre-
viously agree. Non-fraternity men
will not be assessed.

Applications for chairman of the
1967 CONTACT are now being re-
ceived by the Judicial Board, and
must be submitted Sunday night to
Chuck Griffin.

Dr. William Buchanan, chairman
of the Department of Political Sci-

ence, last night addressed a meet-
ing sponsored by the W&L Young
Democrats. The 1941 alumnus of
Washington and Lee assumed his

post as chairman at the
of this semester

Dr. Buchanan spoke on the topic,
“The Future of the Two-Party
Two-Party System.” He began the
speech by saying the topic should
be, “Your Stake as Democrats in
Preserving the GOP.”

Democrats Too Large
The speaker warned that the Dem-

beginning

ocratic Party is facing the prob-
lem of being too large. Nationally
party registration is almost two to
one, and in all levels of govern-
ment the Democrats hold over-
whelming majorities. Because of the
1964 election, the Republicans are

at their weakest since 1996. The Re-

publicans are overwhelmed by two
to one or more majorities in the
House, Senate, and Governorships

Also in 1964 nearly 500 GOP «state
were unseated. The Dem-

Washington and Lee, under the
sponsorship of the Department of
Journalism and Communications.

He will speak on “The Historical

Alternatives Listed

Student body president Fred Min-
del began the meeting by listing th
courses of action that the EC might
take

According to Mindel the Assimila-
tion Committee could be abolished,
given fining power, or left as it is at
present.

The Executive Committee discuss-
ed the degree to which conventional
dress had been accepted by the stu-
dent body during the past year.

Situation Discussed

Joe Framptom said that most of
the freshman class conformed to the
tradition at least on the campus and
at seated meals in Commons

The Executive Committee then re-
turned to consider the effectiveness
of the Assimilation Committee over
the past year

The Assimilation Committee was
found lacking in its attention to its
duties. There were stories told of
persons who had been assimilated,
but who had never been summoned

Th imilation Committ
e Assimilation Co ee

The Executive Committee in an unusually extended session
last evening considered the question of the Assimilation Com-
mittee with particular emphasis on the future of this body. It is
extremely difficult to appreciate the comprehensiveness of the
discussion apart from actual participation. After over four hours
of conscientious and at times frustrating inquiry the Executive

Committee resolved to solicit the opinion of the student body
through a poll.

By vote of nine to one the Executive Committee de-
cided to refer the issue of the Assimilation Committee to the
student body. The purpose of this action is to ascertain the
feeling of students in regard to the possibility of abolishing
the Assimilation Committee as it is presently constituted, and
instituting a “Traditions Committee” which would be con-
cerned primarily with the proper assimilation of freshmen.
This new body would consist of a chairman appointed by the
Executive Committee and any student who indicated a desire to
participate in such a program. This realistic approach is defin-
itely challenging, while the possible rewards are particularly
desirable.

Admittedly, this conclusion appears inconsequential initial-
ly, but certainly the nature of the discussion and its implica-
tions are very pertinent. A fundamental dilemma with which
the Executive Committee is faced is whether there is, indeed,
any correlation between the existence of an Assimilation Com-
mittee and the maintenance of conventional dress. A positive
correlation is generally supported by the belief that students
adhere to conventional dress out of a fear of recrimination
from the Assimilation Committee. Although the committee's
punishment need not involve a fine or possible reprimand, the

fact of its existence personifies a moral obligation.

On the other hand a negative correlation may be easily’

demonstrated by the relatively simple argument that a tradition
is not enforceable by law. In fact, a tradition, in our context,
presupposes voluntary acceptance in order to continue its ex-
istence. The parallel which is often made with the Honor
System is valid because without the voluntary acceptance of
the responsibilities of our Honor System the entire structure
would be meaningless. The necessity of enforcing the Honor
System is a result of our belief that its maintenance is of funda-
mental significance, while enforcement of conventional dress
in this institutionalized manner is perhaps not so essential.
The Executive Committee is trying to determine if, indeed,
there is at Washington and Lee a basic commitment to the
concept of conventional dress. If this commitment, this al-
legiance is lacking, then it is quite obvious that an Assimilation
Committee of any type is inherently ineffective. We would

agree with this analysis and hasten to add, optimistically, that |

there seems to be sufficient evidence to indicate a rather strong
commitment to conventional dress. At the risk of appearing
overly idealistic, we feel that the vast majority of students per-
ceive the benefits of the custom, and are anxious to return it
to the status of a real tradition.

We want to urge students to acquaint themselves with the
position of the Executive Committee, and to consider care-
fully the programs which are forthcoming from this body.
Certainly this issue deserves more than casual attention so
often given to student polls and referendums. It provides an op-
portunity for every student to reevaluate the status of con-
ventional dress, its enforcement, and the intrinsic values which
it offers to our community. In an attempt not to circumvent
the electorate, the Executive Committee is actively soliciting
the opinions and suggestions of all. The obligation, indeed

duty , to respond is clear.

An Armed Camp?

The recent rash of attacks on W&L students prompts some
questions as to the extent to which the University views its
commitment to the doctrine of in locus parenti. Whether or not
the attacks took place on University property, the administra-
tration 1s morally, even if not legally, obligated to take some
positive action.

Bob Murray, University Proctor, appears to be the only
one concerned with the problem, or even aware of it, The at-
titude of Washington Hall seems to be one of incredible in-
difference.

Some students have already armed themselves, and others
are following suit. Before Lexington turns into an armed camp,
we hope the administration will intervene and take an interest

in these muggings

Library Liason

Contributes To The Inadequacies

By ED WOOD |
and KEN CARO |

If there is anything that a ma-|
jority of students and faculty at
Washington and Lee agree upon, it is |
that our library, to say the very |
least, leaves some things to be de-|
sired. This fact is painfully apparent
to all students attempting the most
superficial research on any subject
outside of the life and times of Rob- |
ert E. Lee. |

Shameless Inflation

Our 296,000 or so volumes contain
an extraordinarily large number of

books, some of which are on sale in

shameless inflation of their actual
worth at half the price).

For Aspiring College Deans

By BRUCE RIDER

All of us know fine young men
here at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity who are planning to be lawyers
or doctors or scientists. But have you
ever met anyone who was preparing
to be a college dean or a college
president?

Of course not,

Like bus drivers and shoe sales-
men, college deans and presidents
just seem to happen into their jobs
with little formal training in what
they will actually have to do.

And this, lads is not at all as it
should be,

After all, what would college life
be without deans and college presi-
dents?

Nothing

And what is college with deans
and college presidents?

Nothing

But since we have such types of
jobs available the least we can do

College students would warm up
to a sports-minded president, so it
would be nice for the man enrolled
in pre-presidency to spend as much
time as possible playing, say hand-
ball. Good for you. Keeps the tummy
trim.

Now that we have seen the sig-

ed in taking a book out of our li-

is the most striking contrast to the
simplicity and efficiency of the same
process at VMI.
Embarrassing Questions

The absence of a Xerox copying
machine in the library is another
unnecessary deficiency. The Uni-
versity of Virginia has three such
machines in their library. One might
also ask why the library isn’t open
on Saturday nights or why the
Commerce Library doesn’t have a
fulltime librarian to straighten up
that mess. By the way how do you
get a book out of the Commerce
School Library? Why is the Jour-
nalism School Library always closed?

These and any number of other
criticisms can be made about our
library system. For some of them
perhaps there are valid explanations.
Yet I think the vast majority of
these deprecations are well-founded.

Orgy of Self-congratulation

can be done to help rectify the
situation. Surprisingly enough that

Policy Makers
Still On Spot

By NICK RUFFIN

One of the many unresolved prob-
facing

Washington and Lee
University is inte-
gration. If the
University were a
leader in educa-
tion in the South,
this issue would
have been settled
long ago. Rather
than the last, we
would have been
the first college of
consequence to in-
tegrate. But we
are not integrated,
and I know of no plans on the part
of the University to implement the
arrival of the first Negroes to our
campus.

lems

Ruffin

Eventually, the reluctant leader-
ship of the University will find the
march of events forcing it to un-
der take some hastily conceived and
clumsily executed measure (probably
to rescue a foundation grant). Wash-
ington and Lee’s policy makers,
whoever they may be, will again
be caught nude in public. They will
grasp a diminutive towel and creep
away behind a white column. This
is my impression of the handling
of the original integration statement,
and I see no indication that the next
step will be made with any greater
alacrity.

If Washington and Lee University
really wanted to be integrated, it
would be, with no reduction in the
quality of its students. The an-
nounced policy of the University to
consider all applications from quali-
fied Negro students. Presumably, any
Negro, as qualified as the average
white student accepted, would also
be accepted. But this appears to be
an unrealistic standard.

I have heard criticism of other col-
leges which maintain two sets of
admissions standards and “recruit”
Negroes. Is this reverse discrimina-
tion? An announcement by Harvard
University proves to me that such
adjustment of standards is not. Har-
vard and some enlightened institu-
tions recognize that college board
scores and high school grades, the

normal admission indices, are not
relevant in cases of underprivileged,
slum residents.

Through an intensive selection pro-
gram involving alumni, Harvard ac-
cepts students, Negro and white, who
normally would be rejected on the
basis of scores (400’s) and grades
(unaccredited schools). The results
are that eighty-five per cent of those
accepted under these standards grad-
uate. This record is only slightly (6
per cent) below that of the students
aecepted under the normal standards

The longer Washington and Lee
remains segregated, the more press-
ing our problem becomes. For Wash-
ington and Lee needs Negro students,
if it is to remain significant in the
society; but the Negro has no ap-
preciable need for Washington and
Lee. Under our “only if equal” poli-
cy, a Negro who would be accepted
her would also be accepted at many
northern colleges of equal or super-
ior reputation, with the chance of

‘Ramblings... :
: By MIKE NATION z

That big time college athletics is
professional athletics is a standing
national joke It would be better to
take it as a national disgrace.

Athletics can serve an important
role in our educational institution—
strong mind, strong body, and all
that sort of thing. There is no easier
nor more natural means of fostering
school unity and school spirit.

However, it would appear to be
difficult to have any of these feelings
for the dear old school if one real-
izes that the dear old school’s ath-
letes are not there because of any
attraction of the school—except
money. That they are there to get
an education is secondary or of no
importance.

Often times, especially in the case
of football, the athletes never be-
come a part of the student body.
They are housed in seperate dor-
mitories, variously known the
Zoo, the Animal Farm, etc.

Recruiting practices, schupulous
and unscrupulous. are legendary.
Can you imagine any school seek-
ing out academic students with the
thoroughness and expense that Vic
Bubas seeks out basketball players
for Duke?

One Wisconsin professor once sug-
gested that the school would save
time, and would be putting things
above board, if they would just
simply hired the Chicago Bears to
play for them. (Some Bears’ players
would get an increase in salary if
they did.)

Some people assert that athletic
scholarships are just another way to
get some kid an education. Baloney!
They are being paid to play athletics
and nothing more.

For example, a friend of mine had
a choice between an athletic and
academic scholarship. The athletic
one paid more, which is telling in
itself, so he took it.

This person found it necessary to
work evenings to stay in school. This
compelled him not to make several

maintain a “B”
the coach had his athletic scholar-
ship revoked.

The school refused to give him aid,
since he had “hedged” on his athletic

turn to his Negro slum and try to
accumulate enough money to go back
on campus.

This story is not at all unusual.
The athletic department demands its
money's worth. An athlete has got to
produce money at the turnstiles or
out he goes. Money and how to make
it is the governing factor in most
athletic departments.

The absurd case of this is the VMI
football team. Check this out. They
play only two games in Lexington
because they cannot draw enough
fans to support their recruiting pro-
gram. (Which has not been all that

Matmen Endure Drubbing
At Old Dominion’s Hands

By RAY ZELTNER

Well, the word for the week in
wrestling is ‘wiped.’ The job last
week against Loyola of Baltimore
seems to have been reversed. Old
Dominion defeated the wrestlers 25-
9. (Fortunately, the Junior Varsity
did not wrestle, so I am unable to add
my own infallible ability for adding
points to the opposition.)

Jim Bruton, 123 lb., lost by decision
in the first match. Rolly Jacobs, 130
lb., was pinned (one of two pins in
the entire match), and Co-captain
Kimble White lost by decision.

Payne Wins

Bobby Payne, 145 lb., earned one
of the three decisions for W&L.
Payne earned two take-downs, three
reverses, and two minutes riding
time to defeat his opponent by six
points.

Don Patterson, 152 lb., fought a
close match and lost to his oppon-
ent by one minute riding time, bring-
ing the score to 14-3, in favor of
Old Dominion.

red hot basketball state why did
Rupp have to go out of the state
to fill out his team? Let’s face it,
U. of K. would be just another ball

Tom Kron. And unless the Ohio has
been moved one hundred miles north
to Indianapolis when I wasn’t look-
ing, they are not from Kentucky.

because he was wrestling above his
usual weight class.

Clarke and Stewart Decision

Freshman Jay Clarke, 177 lb.,
brought in the second of W&L’s
decisions by defeating his opponent,
6-2. Warren Stewart, wrestling at
191 ib. (Yes, he did lose a little
weight for this one), followed suit
and also decisioned his opponent,
6-2.

Heavyweight Holmes Raker was
involved in the second pin of the
match. Unfortunately his opponent
pinned him. (It was the third period,
though; it usually happens to me in
the first.)

Well, cela suffit for this week.
If Coach Miller doesn’t have my

to go in front by as much as

<== twenty points as they coasted to their

ninth victory of
thirteen defeats.

This record represents W&L’s best
record since the 57-58 season when
its record was 21-7, and the team
had an All-American, Dom Flora.

The first half was fairly close as
Emory and Henry put up a battle.
The Generals closed with a rush to
hold a seven point lead at the inter-
mission,

Then the Generals’ offense began
to click with more efficiency and
they turned the game into a runa-
way. The Wasps could manage only
one shot at the basket as Bob Spes-
sard, Earl Edwards, and Rob Bauer
controlled the rebounds.

Rob Bauer, playing with a bad
back, scored 20 points in only three-
fourths of the game to pace the Gen-
erals in the scoring column. Big Bob
Spessard, showing a variety of shots,

the year against

ended with 8 field goals for 16
points.
Steve Sweitzer, who helped to

steady the Generals’ attack against
Emory and Henry’s press also hit
in double figures with 12 points. The
fourth Generals to finish in double
figures was John Carrere with 12
points.

With three minutes left in the
game, Bob Spessard left the Gen-
erals’ court for the last time and
90 seconds later Steve Sweitzer fol-
lowed him to the bench. Both re-
ceived a standing ovation from their
teammates and the crowd a sa tri-
bute to their credit as fine Wash-
ington and Lee basketball players.

Notes: With his 13 points against
Hampden-Sydney Wewnesday and
the 20 he scored last night Rob
Bauer finished the regular season
with 343 points in 21 games for a
16.2 average. A similar preformance
in the C.A.C. Tournament this week
would cap a great season for Bauer,
only a freshman, who has had a fine
beginning as a basketball player

...- The big “if” for W&L in the
tournament will be Frank Morrison
and how much he has recovered
from a painful thigh injury. Frank
played the last three minutes Fri-
day night although helimped a little
he made 2 of 3 shots and pulled
down a couple of rebounds.

Despite the loss of Captain Bob
Spessard and Steve Sweitzer big
things can be expected of next year’s
team. With four and the
sixth man back the young Generals
should improve on this year’s rec-
ord with a year of playing exper-
ience under their belts. And if
Coach Canfield can do as well in
recruiting this year as he did last
last year, who knows what limits
next year will hold

Washington University the
favorite in the CAC. Tournament

which James MacGregor Burns
wrote on is practically dead.
Dr. Buchanan Predicts

Dr. Buchanan cautioned against
accepting political predictions, and
then made his prediction. If the
Democrats split because of their
over-extension in size, he predicted
a huge moderate party and two les-
ser parties of conservatives and lib-
eral persuasions, a new phenomenon
in the USS.

The professor declined to con-
ceive of the consequences of a three
party system in America, but re-
minded his audience that our unique
system is the substitute for political
violence which marks most world
polities.

Dr. Buchanan concluded that may-
be in “ten years from now you may
miss the Republicans very, very
badly.”

Graham Elected

Alter a short question and answer
period, Young Democrat President
Sam Frazier held a short business
meeting. To fill a vacancy, John
Graham, Delt junior from Rich-
mond, was elected by acclamation
to be First Vice President. Also all
members were invited to participate
in the Young Democratic Conven-
tion to be held in Alexandria on
March 18, 19, and 20.

The final action of the meeting
was to give Dick Israel, a second-
year law student, permission to ap-
ply for charter for a Young Dem-
ocratic club in the Law School.

For the door-to-door drive the

The major problem of the drive
was a lack of cars. A few areas were
kipped because of this.

of this the final total will not be

convenient point of departure for
alleviating the constant frustration
of search for those never-to-be-
found sources,

Another help would be to estab-
lish faculty-library rapport. The
faculty plays a large role in the
selection of the new books that are
purchased each year. Yet much of
the staff of the library seems to feel
that certain portions of the faculty
do not carry their share of the re-
sponsibility. Apparently few aca-
demic departments in the college
have failed in the past to turn in
requests for new books.

Obvious Deficiencies

Members of the faculty on the
other hand seem to regard the li-
brary staff with disdain. The impli-
cation is that the library people are
hopelessly incompetent. Certainly
there are deficiencies on both sides.
However, there seems to be little ser-
ious attempt to examine just what
deficiencies belong to whom and es-
tablish a new level of faculty-library
co-operation aimed at rectifying
these deficiencies.

 

Albert Watson

Is Speaker At
GOP Sessions

By ALAN STEDMAN

As a prelude to the coming Young
Republican State and _ Regional
Conventions, the Mary Washington
Y. R. Conference was attended by
nine delegates from the W&L YR
chapter. The two day session began
at 8 p.m. on Friday night.

Watson Speaks
Featured before delegates from
twelve Virginia colleges and several
from Pennsylvania and Washington,
D.C., was Congressman Albert Wat-
son from the 2nd district of South
Carolina, He discussed “The Facts
and Fantasy in the Republican Par-

ty and considered certain ideas
and images which, due to over-
emphasis have disgruntled some

elements of the GOP.

The concluding speech of the eve-
ning was given by the College Young
Republican National Chairman, Tom
Pauken. In the course of his dis-
cussion on “Why Youth Are At-
tracted to the Republican Party” he
outlined some of the varied roles
of Republican youth.

Vietnam Discussion

The next morning saw the dele-
gates watching a film entitled, “While
Brave Men Died,” at 9 am. This
was followed by a discussion period
under the leadership of Tom Pauken
in his other capacity of Co-Chairman
of the Committee for the Support of
Vietnam.

At 11:00 a.m., Ray Humphries, who
spoke at W&L this fall, spoke next.

After a break for lunch on Satur-
day, the rather rigorous program
continued with James Kilpatrick's
dissertation on “The View of News-
men toward the GOP!”

Prior to the last speech and ban-
quet was a discussion on “The Right
to Work Committee” which was pri-
marily concerned with 14B of the
Taft-Hartley Labor-relations Aet.
The delegates settled down at din-
net to hear Congressman Tim
Carter of Kentucky speak on our
involvment in Vietnam and other
campaign issues. Originally sehe-
duled for this concluding speech was
Thurston Morton who was unable
to attend because of a bad case of
flu

W&L representatives to the Con-
ference were YR president Roger
Wallace, Jeff Wainscott, Jim Me-
Commons, Alan Rains, Dave White,
Ed Mitchell, John Nazzaro, Art Love,
and Gavin Garrett, who is presently
State Chairman of the College Young
Republicans

Professor Of Economics
Has Article In Magazine

An article by a Washington and

has been published in a recent edi-
tion of “Public Utilities Fortnightly.”

The article by Dr. Charles F. Phil-
lips, Jr., is entitled “Some Observa-
tions on the Federal Communications
Commission’s Telephone Investiga-

The FCC investigation into rates
charged by the American Telephone
and Telegraph Co. for interstate and

Prof. Phillips’ article reviews the
background of the investigation,
summarizes the major problems faced
in the inquiry, and contains general
comments on the investigation and
the regulatory process.

Dr. Phillips is the author of a re-

began to run. He ran up to the First
National Exchange Bank corner,
down to Doc’s Grill, then up past
the Student Union into the New
Dorm. Woods was chased all the way
inside the dorm, but when he came
back to the entrance, armed with a
sword, the two were gone.

Carter and Rhodes went to a pool
room where it is alleged they be-
gan insulting and harassing the
propritor. While Carter was keep-
ing the proprietor busy Rhodes tore
the telephone wire out of the wall

 

 

so he could not call the police.

Attack Near Church

After leaving the pool room, their
next victim was Bob Brenner, whom
they encountered in the Methodist
Church parking lot. They took
Brenner’s glasses, and when he re-
sisted Carer started slugging, hitting
him four or five times. Brenner ran

| to the SPE house, and called the

police. The two were finally arrest-
ed in George's, below the College
Inn, where they were trying to start
another fight.

Carter was charged on four counts
including disorderly conduct, curs-
ing and abuse of a police officer, and
two counts of assault and battery.
Rhodes was charged with destroying

j private property, assault and bat-

tery, and stealing a hat. More
charges will probably be made at a
later date. Both men were released
on bond pending trial on March 8 at
9 a.m.

When asked about the incident,
Bob Murray siad, “W‘e’re going to
throw the book at these two and
show all of them that they can’t
get away with this kind of thing. It’s
the only awy to stop it.”

 

Briggs Looks Upon Bogart

thing is, they aren’t spoofs. They're
the real phony thing.

Final proof of our love of bad
films, if proof were needed, is that
rarely will a french critic or the
Harvard film society praise or men-
tion Bogart as Fred C. Dobbs in
“Treasurer of the Sierra Madre” or
as Mr. Allnut in “The African
Queen,” where he was at the height
of his powers and with material that
enhanced him as much as he en-
hanced it. Here he was not beating
the system but contributing to it.
Such misplaced appreciation of the
man and actor, one cannot help
saying, is a little bogus. If, however,
our gangster and soldier of fortune
movies have been vied with amused
indulgence by the French, if they
have loved their charming vulgar-
ity and even taken it more seriously
than we have on occasion, they
have also raised it to the level of
art in such films as Godard’s
“Breathless.” Next time I shall take
up Belmondo as the “new” Bogart.

ington and Lee. To be the first Negro
student here would be symbolic of
nothing. A Negro who comes to
Washington and Lee will be coming
because he wants to come, because
he sees educational opportunities and
a way of life superior to those
available to him at other colleges.
The social opportunities provided for
the Negro student appear inadequate,
if not intolerable.

I do not mean to be too pessim-
istic, for I think many students
would offer genuine response to the
situation; but the social hierarchy is
such that it would defeat their best
efforts. The dorm life, inadequate,
and the fraternities, with their chart-
ers and ball-systems, would negate
the students’ efforts to bring a
Negro into our community,

Washington and Lee must seek
Negro students, and it must prepare
the way for them as best it can. The
responsibility is shared by the trus-
tees, alumni, administration, faculty
and students.

<3 CLUB &
FASHIONS

By CHIP TOLBERT
ESQUIRE’S FASHION EDITOR

THE MODS OF LONDON have been responsible for nurturing

some of the most radical and exciting fashion ideas in recent

memory. At the outset, however,

let’s make it clear that virtually

none of these fashions are presently being worn on American
campuses, Yet in fashion as in everything else, from extremes
emerge the means, and there’s no doubt that modified versions of
many of these innovations will catch on and be counted among the
best college market sellers in the near future. In any case, we
thought you'd be interested in hearing about what's happening
right now on the London fashion scene, as well as what's being

done in Mod fashions in America.

“SEE YOU IN CARNABY” is the in-phrase among London's way-

out swingers these days. Almost overnight, Carnaby Street, located
in London's fashionable West End, has become the center and the
source of what the Mods refer to as their “instant fashions.” It's
an amusing paradox that Carnaby is located a mere 200 yards from
Savile Row, long recognized as headquarters for London's most
distinguished and conservative tailoring establishments. Who
shops Carnaby? Only the Dave Clark Five, The Rolling Stones, The
Animals, four young men named John, George, Paul and Ringo,
and a fifth who used to be known around town as Anthony Arm-

strong-Jones. And what do they,

and thousands of their fans and

followers, buy there? Some pretty surprising fashions . .,

%

THE MOD TUXEDO, for a start, offers plenty

of surprises. Cut tight and skinny, it features
a3 or 4-button jacket, high, narrow lapels, \ ery
deep side vents, satin belt loops, cuffs, and a
wide satin belt. The trousers are tapered in
extremis, and the outfit may be worn with black
demi-boots. Accessories are radical, if not out.

THE MOD MODE, in all apparel areas, is char-

acterized by certain definite trends, The ward-
robe is form-fitted, and anything smacking of
standardized fashions is “automatically out,”
The plumage on the male bird is getting
brighter and snappier, and there’s no doubt that
it's getting harder all the time to tell the boys
apart from the girls. Prices are comparatively
high: slacks run anywhere from $15. to $25.
we frequently find strong surface interest in a

rich variety of textured fabrics. In slacks, the low-rise, hip-hugging

model is in. Belts

MODISM MOVES ON: here are some more “musts” in the fashion-

conscious Mod's wardrobe, A camel suede overshirt with seamed
pockets and shoulders, usually worn with slacks tapered to the knee,
then flared out to bell bottom cuffs. A pair of giant black-and-white
houndstooth check trousers, worn as low as possible. Ticking-
striped low-rise jeans worn with a matching snap-front jacket,
A rugged blue denim shirt with a high-rise collar and cuffs of white
broadcloth. A fancy soft leather vest. The Mod Suit which doubles

‘EC Establishes Precedent

With Mickey Isikoff Case

A sophomore, Mickey Isikoff, has
been placed on social probation un-
til spring vacation by the Executive
Committee because of repeated viola-
tions of conventional dress regula-
tions. In the precedent-setting de-
cision, the vote was 8 for social
probation, 2 against, and 1 abstaining.
President Fred Mindel did not vote
because he was presiding.

The details of the case are as
follows: Isikoff has had an assimila-
tion record since his freshman year.
This year. he was assimilated re-
peatedly and was called before the
Assimilation Committee twice, where
he was warned that a third violation
would refer his case to the EC.

Isikoff was assimilated at 11 dif-
ferent times by 15 different people.
It is asserted that Isikoft was usual-

CPAs Outline
Uniform Pink

Sheet System

Fraternity presidents and treasur-
ers last night heard outlined a pro-
posal made by Lexington Certified
Public Accountants C. L. Harer and
J. H. Shelton, designed to assure
the greatest practical accuracy of
fraternities’ financial statements,
and to “make shenanigans highly
unlikely.”

 

Speaking in introduction, Dean
Atwood noted that he and Inter-
fraternity Council president Chuck
Griffin have been “thinking about
whether financial statements as they
are now submitted are as proper as
should be.” Under the CPA plan
being considered now, accurate re-

ports by treasurers would be vir-
tually assured, whereas under the

present system they can be “fudged.”
Atwood commented that it is his
personal hope that a_ succesful

and uniform system can be estab-
lished
Mr. Harer observed that both ac-

counting firms in town have seen a
major problem in the constant turn-
over of personnel within the frater-
nities; some type of control, he said,
should be instituted to assure that
a set of standards will be followed
and checks made to assure accuracy.
If proper attention is paid to the
books. Harer claimed, then deviations
will be caught in their earlier stages.

The proposals outlined by the ac-

countants, who were described by
Dean Atwood as “friendly competi-
tors,” began with a study to be

made by the CPA's separately or to-
gether, perhaps with the assistance
of a W&L accounting professor, to
establish a recommended standard-

ly wearing wheat jeans, a sweater,
and a loose or untied tie when as-
similated.

Cooperative but Adamant

Assimilation Committee members
stated that Isikoff appeared before
the committee each time he was
summoned and was cooperative, even
though adamant on wearing his ha-
bitual attire.

The Isikoff case is the first sub-
mitted to the EC under the recent
ruling that the Assimilation Com-
mittee cannot levy fines but must
submit third offenders to the EC.
Other cases are pending however.

The case has come under some
comment because it establishes a
precedent and because of the nature
of the punishment administered to
Isikoff. For Isikoff, social probation
means he cannot enter his fraternity
house for four weeks. Isikoff cur-
rently eats and sleeps there.

When interviewed, Isikoff remark-
ed, “I’m certainly not innocent; it is
true that I was out of conventional
dress, but no more so than a sig-
nificant percentage of people on
campus. I did not expect the severi-
ty of the punishment though. If I
had known how severe it might be,
I would have worn more accept-
able clothing—I had no intention of
making myself a martyr.”

Committeemen Interviewed

In connection with Isikoff’s case,
a number of people on the execu-
tive and assimilation committees
were interviewed. Vice-president
Dave Marchese, representing the
majority opinion of the EC comment-
ed: “The Assimilation Committee
acted under its instructions to send
third violators to the EC. We feel
that after Isikoff had made so many
violations of conventional dress, and
in light of his past record, we had
to serve him with some punishment
We felt that Isikoff was trying to
cause trouble. He has been a chronic
violator since he was a freshman.

Traditional Dress

“Ponder your right to destroy and maim that which
many others before you sustained with pride and dig-
nity. Decide if you wish to share in a unity of spirit
with other Washington and Lee men of many genera-
tions, decide if you are going to hold in contempt or in
apathetic indifference this bond of fellowship. Weight
carefully your obligation to give something of yourself
to this University, as well as your privilege to take a
part of it with you.”

Is it too much trouble to put on a coat and tie in the morn-
ing? Is conventional dress still worth the trouble of maintaining
it? The student body will soon have a clear chance to resolve
these questions in the forthcoming referendum on the Assimi-
lation committee, for the EC has stated its intention to use
the students’ decision as a guideline. Should we keep the com-
mittee or not?

Obviously, the issue hinges on whether conventional dress
has a significant value today, and it is our opinion that it cer-
tainly does. Washington and Lee is one of the few remaining
universities of national prominence which still values the aristo-
cratic principles of honor, casual civility to one’s colleagues, and
gentlemanly deportment and dress. If we allow ourselves to
descend into the mass of common non-conformism that char-
acterizes so much of American education we will be destroy-
ing the heritage of a century, robbing ourselves of a tremendous
asset, and denying our successors a set of values that manifestly
deserves to be perpetuated.

As students here, we are often in a position of being un-
able to see the forest for the trees. On a day-to-day basis, con-
ventional dress simply means taking the trouble to dress as
adults. To W&L graduates, however, the continued existence
here of traditions like conventional dress serves to distinguish
W&L men from graduates of hundreds of nearly similiar
schools. The W&L alumnus is almost unique today in having
been educated as a gentleman.

There are not many students here who blatantly violate
the spirit of conventional dress, but they exert a destructive
influence far out of proportion to their numbers. The regrett-
able fact behind the impotence of the Assimilation Committee
and its current disrepute among the students is that a vocifer-
ous minority is snowballing the passive majority into abandon-
ing concepts that are of great value.

This minority is attacking the rights of the rest of us in
attempting to destroy traditions that have always been sources
of pride and molders of character in the W&L man. If these
people were simply stressing the importance of individuality,
they could be ignored or even supported—but they are not.
They are undermining W&L’s greatest asset and distinction,
and they are hurting us all. The students who dress sloppily are
degrading an institution which does credit to each individual
W&L student.

Our distinctive position as W&L men will exist only so long
as W&L remains a distinctive university. For our own good
and for the preservation of an outstanding heritage, we, the
majority, must at last begin to move against the destruction
of our traditions and those few who are destroying them.

At present, there are at least three ways of individual ac-
tion: become part of an active consensus of disapproval to-
ward those who flaunt the W&L tradition; support your stu-
dent government by assimilating offenders; and vote to
strengthen the Assimilation Committee in the forthcoming
election. If the currently passive opinions of the majority can
be mobilized, then we can still save the rich tradition of W&L
before it is irrevocably lost.

Characteristic Gesture

The presentation of the Noell-Eckes Trophy, honoring
the University’s top debater, characterizes Dean Frank Gil-
liam’s 39 years of devotion, and dedicated service to Wash-

During his many active years, Gilliam has served as teacher,
administrator, and trusted friend to thousands of students. He
remains today a faithful friend of the University and its student
body.

In honoring two of our finest debaters, Dean Gilliam
is displaying once again the deep affection which he holds
every student. it is a characteric gesture; a magnificent ges-

By JEFF WAINSCOTT

The issues surrounding the strug-
gle to prevent the affiliation of Wash-
ington and Lee with the National
Student Association are numerous
and can quite easily become emo-
tional. It is to be hoped that a ra-
tional discussion of both sides will
prevail. I would like to briefly state
two of the major arguments against
affiliation, first that the so-called
services provided by NSA are not at
all what they seem, and second, that
NSA consistently takes unrepresen-
tative political stands.

One of the most appealing argu-
ments made on behalf of NSA is that
they can help bring W&L out of its
isolationism with all the useful ser-
vices they provide. It sounds nice,
but the facts behind these glittering
promises are somewhat less than
glittering. Fred Mindel has repeated-
ly stressed the low cost and wide
variety of these services. One fre-
quently mentioned cost is $15.

In a letter from one of the leaders
of the successful fight against NSA
at Hollins, we are told that Hollins
was paying some $600 per year and
receiving virtually no services. At
Lawrence College in Wisconsin, $750
was paid to NSA for benefits which,
acording to student leaders at Law-
ence, could have been obtained else-
where for only $52.50. The other
$700 went for conferences which
even the NSA campus coordinator
has admitted were of no value to
Lawrence.

The University of Miami also
spent $600, and the NSA dues of
Dartmouth amounted to some $84.
Strong evidence is going to have
to be presented to prove that NSA
will actually deliver what it prom-
ises. There is a great abundance of
evidence to the contrary.

Now, the political side of NSA
should be discussed. The National
Student Association is composed of
student governments representing
some 350 or so schools, a very small
proportion of all the American col-
leges and universities. NSA deals
only with a handful of student lead-
ers and not with the student bodies.
Consequently, a good many of the
students which NSA claims to repre-
sent have never even heard of the
organization. Yet, NSA has stated
that it represents “a student point
of view which is the most represen-
tative that can be obtained by the
democratic process.”

What is this point of view? Each
summer NSA holds a national con-
vention at which they pass resolu-
tions on behalf of student opinion.
Admittedly, the political resolutions
make up only a small part of all
those passed, yet they are so con-
trary to what I believe is American
student opinion, that I do not un-
derstand how NSA can legitimately
make them.

As some may recall, some of these
positions were outlined in an earlier
letter to the R-t P. At the last con-
vention they ranged from calling
for the admission of Red China to
the UN, to recommending cessation
of the bombing of North Viet Nam
and “unconditional talks to include
separate National Liberation Front
participation.” They also suggested
the substitution of a new national
police force for the FBI in matters
of “racial violence and brutality.”
These positions would hardly seem
to be those of the majority of Amer-
ican students.

Why was NSA able to pass such
resolutions? One reason might be
that often not even a majority of the
member schools send delegates to
the conventions, as in 1963 only 45
pereent participated. Also in 1963,
only 35 per cent of the resolutions
passed were passed by the conven-
tion. The remainder were handled
by the thirty-one member execu-
tive committee. NSA has very flimsy
grounds for claiming representation
of student opinion.

It might be mentioned that NSA
offers the rather dubious scape-goat
of minority reports for those who op-
pose the resolutions passed. These
minority reports, if anyone takes the
time to prepare them, rarely receive
the attention of a resolution passed
by NSA in convention or in execu-
live committee,

One further point should be made
clear. For my part, I oppose NSA
taking political stands, not because
I disagree with those stands, but
because they are clearly not rep-
resentative and NSA claims they are.
In conclusion, I would suggest that
NSA as presently constituted, has no
right to represent any political po-
sition, liberal, conservative or what-
ever, as that of the majority of
American students, and that the ser-
vices are not what they sem. It is
for these reasons that I and many

 

others are opposing NSA at W&L.

NSA And Washington And Lee

By RICHARD NASH
Sophomore Executive Committeeman

It would be a pretty safe bet to
wager that ninety percent of Wash-
ington and Lee’s student body has
no idea what the letters NSA rep-
resent. And it would probably be an
equally safe bet to venture that
most of them don’t even care to
know.

So why all the uproar over the
thing? The uproar is because some
students do care, and more ought to.
The United States National Student
Association is an organization whose
membership Washington and Lee’s
Executive Committee is considering
joining. But the question has arisen
as to whether or not the advantages
of NSA outweigh its disadvantages.

Supporters of membership point
out some very desirable advantages.
The Executive Committee, this year,
is undertaking a full schedule of
studies and reforms. These studies
could be greatly aided with the help
of NSA. For example, let us assume
that the E.C, is incestigating a
change in W&L’s inadequate grading
system. As it stands now, we must

 

has moved progressively toward be-
ing a pressure group for Congres-
sional legislation.

Each summer, NSA holds a con-
vention to which all member schools
send delegates. These delegates dis-
cuss and take stands on world prob-
lems. It is believed that the results
of these stands are preplanned and
rigged by a small number of polit-
ically-influenced leaders. In the last
several years, these conventions have
tended to take ultra-liberal stands
which are definitely not in keeping
with the majority opinion of W&L
students. Among other things they
have favored admission of Red
China to the UN, immediate cessa-
tion of bombing in North Vietnam,
unilateral disarmament, and an at-
tack on the American college fra-
ternity system.

Many students sincerely do not
want W&L to go on record as sup-
porting such issues. So opposed are
they to it, that they have raised
money to bring a speaker here to
address the ODK Forum.

Evidence as to NSA’s decreasing
popularity stands in the fact that

 

By APGAR

 

write any number of separate letters|33 colleges and universities have

to various colleges and universities
in the hope that they will return
information to us concerning how
their grading system works. These
letters take much time to write, and
replies are slow in coming if they
come at all.

If, however, we belong to NGA,
we could write to NSA's permanent
staff and we would receive extensive
information on as many colleges’
grading systems as we asked for.
And, we would receive it within
a week,

a national-international student
identification card and receive dis-
counts of 5 per cent to 25 per cent
or more on services, goods, and
amusements throughout the nation
and world.

Unfortunately space limitations do
not permit any more advantages to
be listed here. But abundant litera-
ture and information concerning
NSA’s advantages may be obtained
from either myself (463-6909) or
Fred Mindel (463-2484).

Meanwhile, on the other side, we
find students who are violently op-
posed to W&L's membership in NSA.
They are not without legitimate
reason either. Their main objec-

 

tion is that the NSA, since its origin,

 

dropped their membership since
1961 and 14 more have rejected pro-
posed NSA affiliation. One of these
rejections came from Washington
and Lee when our membership in
the organization was earlier pro-

The Young Americans for Freedom
feel so strongly against NSA, that
they have waged all out war against
the organization. They contend that
“NSA represents the Liberal-leftist
line to be the true opinion of all
American students.”

Again, because of space, all the
evidence against NSA cannot be pre-
sented. More information may be
obtained from myself or from Jeff
Wainscott (463-6905),

The choice seems to be a simple
one. Are the numerous advantages
that can be received worth being
faslely represented on liberal policies
or not’ I would like to encourage all
students to read about NSA in the
Ring-tum Phi, listen to the speakers
at the ODK Forum, and contact Fred
Mindel and Jeff Wainscott for addi-
tional information, It is only in this
way that you can reach an intelli-
gent decision,

Campus Critics Challenge & Support
Joining National Student Association

Pro

By JOYCE RIDDLE

President SGH
Hollins College
NSA has one purpose: to see that
the American student is given every
educational advantage. NSA provides
us with the third dimension in edu-
cation—a nationally respected for-
um for expression, and the financial
means for action. At the national
conference delegates gather to cri-
ticize student activity in the US.
Opinions expressed range from Stu-
dent Government, to social activity
in the community, to national and
international affairs.

Student comment on Student Gov-
ernment is readily accepted. There is,
however, great debate as to whether
or not students should actively ex-
press, especially on a national and
international level, political views.
It is the political aspects of NSA
that I would wish to defend. A
common criticism is that students
are too inexperienced to have sig-
nificant political opinions. Yet we
vote, our income taxes support Medi-
care and the Poverty Program, and
we fight in Viet Nam. Though our
age, if nothing else, puts us at a
disadvantage, the fact that we are
forced to support government pro-
jects with our money and our time
should inspire us to overcome any
disadvantage and inform ourselves.

Let’s asume that you, the read-
er and I, the writer, are in accord
thus far. How, you ask me, does
NSA fit in? For one thing, the po-
litical opinions expressed by NSA
might not be identical to those of
W&L. W&L should thus not concern
itself with NSA. My answer is that,
first of all, the opinion of NSA de-
pends completely on the opinion of
its members. These opinions take the
form of resolutions and mandates
passed at the congress. These reso-
lutions do not represent ‘spur of
the moment’ decisions, but must be
passed in essentially the same form,
at two consecutive congresses before
becoming basic policy declarations.

Secondly, and most important,
W&L’s membership in NSA in no
way means that you support every
policy and opinion arrived at dur-
ing the congres. On the contrary,
whenever a minimum of 20 per cent
of delegates dissent, a minority re-
port is published next to the reso-
lution, and W&L’s name would be
listed in print as a member of the
opposition,

But you might further contend,
NSA is controlled by liberals and
the conservative moderate voice of
W&L could never be heard. It is
true that at the 65 congress, the lib-
eral caucus outnumbered that of the
conservatives two to one. But I
would remind you that the uncom-
mitted delegates outnumbered both
these groups four to one. The vote
of the uncommitted delegates decided
the issues, and these delegates were
swayed by the force of the argu-
ments presented on the floor. I would
also point out that the single most
influential speaker at the congress
was the delegate from Agnes Scott, a
small women's college in Georgia.
Surely W&L could produce an
equally forceful representative,
thereby insuring that your political
convictions will not only be heard,
but will be carried. If you presently
express a political opinion at W&L,
your voice carries no further than
the Lexington city limits. Opinions
expressed at the NSA congress are
heard nationally and internationally
through such publications as The
New York Times, The Student, and
Time Magazine, They are often pre-
sented to Congressional sub-commit-
tees by NSA national officers,

NSA is the oldest and most rep-
resentative organization of its kind
in the U.S. By its history of achieve-
ments it has attained international
respect. Thus, like it or not, it is
considered the prime voice of Amer-
ican student opinion. In the words of
John F. Kennedy: “The NSA can

review its history with pride... It
has provided the American student
community with a forum for ex-
pressing student opinion on vital
iasues of the day. Its national con-
Kresses are invaluable experiences
in the workings of democratic legis-
lative processes...” Eisenhower said
that “at a time when understanding

among people of the world is so im-
portant to our future, | am partie-

ularly glad to hear of the increased
emphasis being given to international
affairs in NSA.”

NSA does not claim to represent
the opinion of all American students
It represents only a relatively amall

Generals Win, 72-70
In First C A C Game

Employing the services of Virginia
Telephone and Telegraph to track
down the results, the Ring-tum Phi
has learned that the Generals of
Washington and Lee have won their
first game in the Collegiate Athletic
Conference basketball tournament,
72-70 over Southwestern.

The Generals opened fast, racing
ahead 21-6 before the Lynx began to
hit. At halftime the gap had been
narrowed to five, 40-35,

After the break Southwestern be-
gan a full court press defense, driv-
ing the Generals into numerous floor
errors. With Washington and Lee
turning over the ball, Southwestern
continued to gain, and within 24 sec-

Only Trivia Contest Entries
Despite Champagne Offer

By CLARK KENT
Mild-Mannered Reporter

Entries for the First Annual W&L
Trivia Championships have been dis-
appointingly few so far. according to
John Beresford Tipton, the chair-
man of the group which is sponsor-
ing the event.

“So far we have received entries
from only two fraternities and the
Independent Union,” Tipton says. “I
am surprised that so few of our
school’s trivia experts want to com-

pete for the bottle of champagne |)

we are offering as a prize.”

It has been decided to make the
event a competition among four two-
man teams. Should more than four
teams be entered, a_ preliminary

written exam will be given to pick ||

the finalists, who will compete over
WREL sometime in the middle of
March.

Entries accepted so far include
Bob Knowles and Claude Rodgers,
for Phi Gam; Dave Mathewson and
Randy Poore, for Kappa Sig; and Len
Mickle and Benard Person, for the
Independents.

Tipton urged athletic directors to
select their entries at the earliest
possible date. “A great deal of prac-
tice will be necessary if the teams
are to learn to work together
smoothly,” he said. Entries should be
mailed to Special Assistant Tom
White at Box 457.

Generals To Play Varsity
Tomorrow Despite Snow;
Sackett, David To Return

Owing to the quick melting of
yesterday's snow the annual Alum-
ni-Varsity ski meet will not be held
tomorrow. A football game will be
played instead

Head Coach Lee McLaughlin will
take the 1966 Generals into what he
says will be “not too much like a
game, but we'll try.” The team held
a scrimmage yesterday at the height
of the storm, and Coach Mac says
“We got some good hitting in.”

The alumni squad, coached by as-
sistant Bob Payne will include re-
turnees Bill David, Henry Sackett,
Charlie Gummey, Terry Fohs, and
Dan Manson. “I understand Coach
Leslie may get in for oneplay,” says

Coach Mac. “If he does, we'll run
right at him, of course.”
Most of this year’s seniors will al-

so play for the alumni, with the two
large exceptions of Billy Andrew
and John Anthony

This is an impressive lineup, head-
ed by Fohs, a graduate of the class
of 1962 and a Litle All-America line-
backer despite his 145 pounds. Sac-
kett and Gummey, both outstanding

runners, will give

a backfield led by senior Larry
Craig

The alums will also be strong in
the passing department with Craig
throwing to fellow seniors Tersh

Baker and Bob Barclay and to All-
State flanker Bill David

The varsity will probably start
Andy Bloom at the helm with a
fine deep young backfic ld provid-
ing the offensive punch. The big
question mark in the General offense
will be the line, almos all of whom
tarters trom iast yeat will be play
ing for the alumni tomorrow

Tilden, the game’s top scorer with
20 points, hit a set shot to tie the
game for the first time. 70-70.

But the Generals didn’t fold, as
with three seconds left senior Steve
Sweitzer passed to fellow senior Bob
Spessard, who hit a sweeping hook
from the top of the key to advance
the Generals to the second round to-
night opposite Sewanee.

Sweitzer led the team in a well
balanced scoring attack with 14
points, as Rob Bauer followed with
12 and Spessard 10. Jody Kline and
Earl Edwards just missed double
figures.

The Generals hit 37 per cent to
the Lynx’s 33 and beat them on
the boards where they have been
strong all year 55-38.

opponent in the final will be the

Mardi Gras Survivor Writes Memoirs

By CHARLIE BENSINGER

“No trouble, just calling to clue
you in where I am. Uh, it seems that
I'm in New Or-
leans.”

“Yeah, Louisi-
ana!”

“Yeah, I realize
that school is still
in Virginia.”

“Well, after all,
it’s Mardi Gras.
Uh-huh, I know.”

“Well, look at it

this way....”
+

Bensinger

The above is the
intro to an amazing phone call,
amazing because I stayed out of
trouble (1 think, I haven't spoken to
my father yet).

New Orleans at Mardi Gras time
is the only town in the world where
you can have more drunks than in-
habitants. Take the total population,
add twenty thousand, deduct one
(the police chief) and that’s the
number of those who will swear
when its all over that somebody
must have driven a Mack truck over
their heads.

Bourbon Street isn’t the only spot
either. The reason is very simple—
you just can't squeeze more than ten
thousand men, women, and queers
there at one time, no matter how
hard you try.

The whole town erupts in a blaze
of partying. The parade routes, the
rest of downtown, the suburbs all
make the wildest affair even at our
hallowed institution seem like Cadet
parties in the Guardhouse. To single
out any one place would be unfair,

but... back to the Quarter.

There’s the Downtown Motel, right |

on Bourbon, with each room open-
ing onto a balcony. One lady, or
perhaps woman to make a distinc-
tion, ducked into her room and
came back with a pair of panties
which ‘she threw to the mob be-
low. When the fight for the prize
was over, a right fair looking (trans-
lation—real tough) babe decided not

to be outdone. On another balcony, '

with the aid of her escort, she took
off and threw down her stockings,
garters, and panties. Heard in the
crowd: Hey, lady, you ain’t got no
panties on.

Then there was the 62”, 240-
pounder who was wearing leotards
so tight that you could easily see
that his posterior was broken.

(Don’t think that it isn’t tough try-
ing to say things without really say-
ing them).

Or the girls, some very good look-
ing, who weren't really girls. There
were a few guys who got a few
surprises.

Let’s not forget what seemed to
be half the navy was also there to
party. It seamed the other half was
the Shore Patrol sent to look after
them.

And how about Hell's Angels. The
closest that one actually got was the
Mississippi River Bridge (probably

ithe Huey P. Long Bridge—every-
thing else down there is named af-
ter Him). The news reports were
very fair. One said that a trio of
Angels picked up was unarmed, ex-
cept for three switchblades,,
jack handle, and a set of tire chains.

The General swimmers, sporting

a fine 8-3 dual meet record, will
face Sewanee and Washington at

will not count toward the overall

schools entered, trophies and
medals will be awarded to the win-
ners.
W&L coach Norris Eastman, who
is in charge of the event, predicts a
very close meet, “All three teams
are about equal in quality,” he said,
“but Sewanee seems to have enough
superiority in depth to rate a slight
edge on paper, while Washington

to go over .500 for the season, as
they carry a 4-4 record into the
meet.

Coach Dick Miller, however is not
optimistic. “They’re stronger than
they were last year when we tied
them 12-12,” he said, “and you
would have to say we are weaker.
There are three or four real close
matches, so it can be fairly close or
it could be a runaway for them.”

Three seniors will be wrestling for
the last time for W&L. They are
Jim Bruton at 130, and co-captains
Kemble White and Jamie Andrew at
137 and 160 respectively. Bruton will
face Frank McCall, who defeated
him last year in a JV match, while
White wrestles Bob Rhodes, beaten
by Dick Musick of W&L last year.
Andrew's opponent will be Herb
Soles.

Other matches in the meet will
probably pit Rolly Jacobs at 123
against undefeated John Shurberg
and Bobby Payne at 145 against
Rod Wilson. Don Patterson will face
Pat McCarthy, who lost to Tom
Stover last year, in the 152-pound
class.

Cary Stewart, brother of W&L
heavyweight Warren Stewart and
winner over Andrew last year, will
wrestle at either 167 or 177. At the
former weight, he would face Bob-
by Munson, (who would give away
about five pounds), while at 177 his
opponent would be Jay Clarke.

Walter Childes will fill the other
spot for the Cavaliers. The heavy-
weight match will pit Warren Stew-
art against Bob Shimmer, a 5-0 win-
ner over Bruce McPhee in last year’s
freshman meet.

Cold Check Committee Reports

(Continued from Page 1)

He added that the committee has
not generally imposed heavy fines,
in the belief that it is more import-
ant to have the check made good
than for the committee to make
money. He stated his own opposition
to an increase in fines.

Fleischer also explained that the
sharp rise in the number of bad
checks appearing since the middle of
December—three-fourth of the to--
tal—was a normal trend, due to the
fact that merchants will often hold
bad checks until the end of a se-
mester before bringing them before
the committee, that many students
run unexpectedly low on money to-
ward the semester’s end, and that
the committee itself is unable to
meet during the examination weeks.

The EC unanimously voted a $3
fine for any student who, before
appearing before the Cold Check

Committee, had been contacted by
the merchant involved but had still
not made good the check. The fine
would be in addition to the regular
fines imposed by the committee.

The EC also voted to recommend
the possibility of making signs which
could be placed on merchants’ reg-
isters and which would remind stu-
dents of their responsibilities in
writing a check. It also suggested
more frequent calls by members of
the committee on certain stores and
resturants which have complained
recently of the numbers of bad
checks which they are receiving.

President Fred Mindel announced
also that the ODK Forum on the
National Student Association will
take place at 7:30 p.m. on Wednes-
day, March 2. The place has not
yet been set. The student poll on
the question has been scheduled for
Friday, March 4.

 

 

Pink Sheet Changes Proposed

(Continued from page 1)

system—in order that all houses will
use the same terminology for expen-
ditures and receipts, etc. Each fra-
ternity should have an annual audit.
“Every effort should be made to
have qualified boys act as treasur-
ers,” not necessarily “popular” or
“needy” students, although it will
be a problem to find eighteen quali-
fied to do the job. Each fraternity
would send new elected treasurers
to the house’s CPA for instruction;
books of the houses would be check-
ed at least every third month, and
more often—even monthly—if the
accountant should feel it necessary.
Others in each house should con-
cern themselves with funds: vouchers
and checks should necessarily be
countersigned by another officer, and
proof of expenditures should be
maintained. This practice is not now
followed, Mr. Harer commented, es-
pecially with social funds,

The proposed CPA plan, Harer
continued, would possibly cost more
than audits, for those fraternities
which even bother with audits; but
records will be kept more accurate-
ly and efficently if the job is done
regularly and thoroughly—and there
is less chance of “trouble.” The ac-
countants would not necessarily
audit the books completely each time
they are reviewed, but audits would
be performed on accasion without
warning.

Some houses, he said, keep books
so incomplete that they cannot be
audited at all—in some cases, only
a “guess” can be made as to what
“might have been done with money.”
Any accountants can guarantee the
accuracy of a set of books only when
they are complete with correct re-
ceipts and vouchers.

A rather heated question-and-
answer session followed, with at
least one fraternity which has an
audit of sorts each month by its
National that the accountants stated
is more like a bookkeeping check and
others whose books “are in good
order now” see no advantage to
spending the aproximate expense

Points brought out in response to
and in comment on questions includ-
ed Dean Atwood’s observations that
“literally half the treasurers on cam-
pus cannot state their present actual
financial positions” and that some
pink sheets are turned in with mis-
takes made on them and yet they
balance. Griffin stated that the pur-
pose of the IFC’s investigation of
the proposal is “to keep the (school)
administration from taking action on
its own.” (Dean Atwood’s reply:
“HE said it, not me.”) Atwod re-
fused to commit himself as to wheth-
er the administration would take

Griffin said that he expects a mo-
tion for a constitutional amendment

es, to require all fraternities to

low the tradition. We realize that
there are other chronic offenders
and regret that the student body has
not taken action on them. Our po-
sition is that we are simply carry-
ing out our job and are not trying to
make an example of Isikoff.

“But if the Isikoff case is to be
considered an example because of
| the precedent we established, then
we would hope the rest of the stu-

 

| dent body will be encouraged to ac-

cept their responsibilty and assimi-
late other such chronic violators.
Granted the BHC realizes that the
student body does not wear con-
ventional dress 100 per cent of the
time, but it is the chronic violator
whose ‘unconventional’ attire is det-
rimental to both the spirit and code
of conventional dress.”

Marchese reported that some of
the Executive Committee members
felt that Isikoff’s punishment was
lenient. In the past, he said, such
blatant violators have come under
suspension from the University.

President Mindel, speaking for the
minority opinion, stated: “Although
my personal opinion differs radically
with the majority opinion of the EC
which resulted in the action taken
regarding Isikoff, I stand one hun-
dred per cent behind this decision
and the BC's right to make it.

“Every member of the EC whole-
heartedly supports the idea of con-
ventional dress and the action taken
against Isikoff was to a large degree,
I believe, an expression of that sen-
timent. It must be remembered that
these men are in office only because
the student body displayed confi-
dence in their integrity and judg-
ment. The fact cannot be denied
that in this matter every member
honestly and sincerely voted how he
thought best, and for this reason I

stand behind and respect their votes,
even while in disagreement.

“I do not stand alone in my com-
plete antipathy, not to the idea of
conventional dress, but to any arbi-
trary and universal enforcement of
it. To those of you who disagree not
only with this specific act of en-
foreement—but also with any means
of compulsary enforcement—I urge
you to express this opinion in the
upcoming poll. For the first time in
many years the abolition of conven-
tional dress is not merely a vague
possibility, but rather a distinct
probability.”

Assimilation Comimttee Chairman
Sam Frazier commented on his com-
mittee’s role in the Isikoff case. “I

feel that there are two things wrong
with the Assimilation Committee,”
said Frazier. “First, if conventional
dress is going to be enforced, there
should be some gradation in penali-
ties. It seems unfair to just talk to
a student at his first offenses, and
then hit him with a drastic punish-
ment. We consider this incident re-
grettable, as we feel sure the IFC
must—regrettable in the sense that
such a severe penalty was necessary.
We feel that this unfortunate sit-
uation could have been avoided if
the Assimilation Committee had had
a discretionary fining power, like the
Student Control Committee, and in
using that power, had dealt with this
violator in a less severe way before
the present situation was reached.

no books on achieving scholarship.
“The great problem is MOTIVA-
TION.”

He said the problem of scholar-
ship is rooted within the structure of
each house. “The chapter house must
become a home, instead of a club-
house.”

He felt this was the point most
W&L fraternities neglected. He noted
the local sysiem was not growing
toward these objectives and “when
you're not growing, you’re dying.”

Ask where he felt fraternities
must start in redefining objectives,
Fletcher said “a clear cut course of
action must be formulated and fol-
lowed by the fraternities.”

“You could start by holding a re-
treat,” explained Fletcher. He de-

fined the retreat as a 2-3 day meet-
ing of fraternity leaders away from
Lexington to discuss the course of
action which fraternities must follow.

He said a general revamping, start-

Terming Monday night’s 14-4 vote
against a single rush publication
“ridiculous,” he said freshmen must
view fraternities, and their objec-
tives “through something other than

Agreeing that social activities were
a part of every fraternity, he felt
the general indoctrination of fresh-
man in social goals from rush week
on was decaying many of the other
goals—scholastic included— fraterni-
ties should ascribe to instill,

23 TAPPED AT ODK ASSEMBLY TODAY

ODK Initiates New Forum; Isikoft Appeal

First M eeting

to be Tonight

To Discuss NSA Student Poll

By BILL WILKERSON

The ODK Leadership Forum has
been reorganized and will hold its
first meeting tonight. The meeting
will be held in Lee Chapel at 7:30.

Tonight’s program is a debate on
the advisibility of W&L’s affiliating
with the National Student Associa-
tion. A student poll on this matter
is to be held this Friday.

The purpose of the Leadership
Forum is to provide student lead-
ers with a place and time to ex-
change ideas and opinions on topics
of concern among the student body.

The debate tonight will
formal one, but questions from the
floor will be considered at the close
of the debate.

be a

The speakers in favor of NSA
will be Jim Johnson and Joyce
Riddle. Mr. Johnson is National

Vice-president of NSA. Miss Riddle
is the president of the student gov-
ernment Hollins College. Her
opinions appeared in last Saturday’s
Ring-tum Phi.

Opposing these speakers will be
Tom Tauken and another girl from

‘
ab

Hollins College. Mr. Pauken is at
present College Director for the

Young Republican National Federa-
tion.

Fred Mindel said that the debate
should present some excellent argu-
ments on the question of NSA and
on the conservative versus liberal is-
sue as a whole.

The new structure of the Leader-
ship Forum is to include a Forum
and a Council. The Forum will be
open to anyone while the Council
will be composed of 14 selected cam-
pus leaders.

The Forum will include the presi-
dents of each of the undergraduate
and law school classes, 2 represen-
tative from the Executive Commit-
tee, the president, vice-president,
and a representative from the Inde-
pendent Union.

The Forum will meet whenever an
issue of significant concern to the
students comes up on campus.

Following the meeting the Coun-
cil of the ODK Leadership Forum
will meet to draw up a resolution on
the basis of the night's discussion.

 

 

A large turnout is expected for
this evening’s meeting. The issues
to be discussed will have a direct
effect on the outcome of the EC
poll concerning this matter on Fri-
day. All students are urged to par-
ticipate in this first campus-wide
ODK experiment.

Chuck Walker, president of Alpha
circle of ODK, expressed his hope
that the concept of the forum would
be well received and that students
would feel free to participate in the
discussions. In addition, Walker stat-
ed that other pertinent issues which
may arise during the year should
be brought to the attention of the
Council.

Junkin Works |
Are Displayed
In duPont Hall

A retrospective show of the works
of artist Marion Junkin, professor of
fine arts at Washington and Lee
University, will be on display this
month in duPont Hall Art Gallery.

The show will feature primarily
oils, with some water colors and
sculpture by Junkin, who has served

To EC Denied
At Meeting, 6-5

By GEORGE A. MORGAN
Staff Reporter

After a meeting last night which
lasted more than three hours, the
Executive Committee refused to res-
cind the social probation meted out
to sophomore Mickey Isikoff for re-
peated violations of conventional
dress. The vote was 6-5, with Presi-
dent Fred Mindel not voting.

Isikoff said that he realized that
he was guilty, but that he felt the
penalty was too severe. He further
stated that those assimilating him
were doing it as a joke, or out of
malice. Isikoff indicated his intention
to take his case to whole student
body if his appeal failed.

Summarizing the Affair

Mindel listed several points which
had to be considered in the Isikoff
ease: the penalty was more severe
than those handed down for Cold
Check and Siudent Control Commit-
tee violations; the penalty was not
previously specified; there is no
precedent for the penalty; and, the
vindictivenes of the assimilators.

Other persons appeared at the
meeting in Isikoff’s behalf, includ-
ing seniors Nick Ruffin and Bruce
Kramer.

Charles Phillips
Delivers Speech
At O D K Day

By SCOTT SNOWDEN
Omicron Delta Kappa, nation-
al leadership fraternity, today
took in twenty-three new mem-
bers in the annual tapping cer-
emonies. Washington and Lee

chapter president, Chuck
Walker presided as three alumni
four law students, eleven seniors
and five juniors were named for

membership. Dr. Charles F. Phillips,
president of Bates College, gave the
annual address. A banquet in Evans
Dining Hall for old and new mem-
bers followed the assembly.

ODK was founded at Washington
and Lee in 1914 for the purpose of
“bringing together campus leaders
in a more relaxed atmosphere.”
Membership is extended to students
ranking in the upper 35 per cent
of their class who have made sig-
nificant contributions in the field of
scholarship, athletics, publications,
social and religious affairs, speech,
music, and dramatic arts.

Dr. Phillips, graduate of Colgate
University and Harvard Graduate
School is widely known as a speak-
er on educational and economic de-
velopments. He serves as a director
of the Central Main Power Company,
the Union Mutual Life Insurance
Company and others. Full particu-
lars of his speech will be covered
in the Friday Ring-tum Phi.

Those tapped were as follows:

Feet Of Clay

A news story which appeared in last Friday’s paper con-

cerning the Isikoff case grossly

misrepresented a statement by

student body president Fred Mindel. Although the error was
unintentional we want to make it perfectly clear that Mr. Min-

del does not view the abolition

of conventional dress as a dis-

tinct probability nor does he advocate any measure designed to
lessen the effectiveness of this tradition in our community.

We are constantly appalled by the efforts of certain ele-
ments of this student body to equate the existence of the As-
similation Committee with the maintenance of conventional
dress. There is certainly no evidence correlating the Assimila-
tion Committee with a high degree of conformity to our code
of dress. In fact there is increasing evidence from the last few
years that the Committee’s continued existence is a hindrance.

It is extremely difficult, if notimposisble, logically to im-

pose conventional dress on the

student body by means of an

enforcement committee with the power to fine or levy social
restrictions. At the risk of being repetitious, we wish to state
emphatically that a tradition is supported and enforced by the
cooperation of the majority exercising social controls, not a
small, vindictive and perhaps hypocritical group of students

doling out fines.

The editorial in last Friday’s edition is particularly lament-

able because it simply failed to deal with the current issue, i.e.

whether there is any correlation

between the Assimilation Com-

mittee and the maintenance of conventional dress. The issue
does not “hinge on whether conventional dress has a significant
value today;” we concede this point.

We would hope that our distinctive position among the
institutions of this country has a broader appeal and that
those students who honestly question the validity of an Assimi-
lation Committee are not guilty of “undermining W&L’s great-

est asset and distinction.”

If the maintenance of conventional dress is all that dis-
tinguishes Washington and Lee from “hundreds of nearly
similar schools,” then indeed, the idol has clay feet.

 

The Life You Save...

The problem of students being mugged in the streets of
Lexington is one with which all members of the University
community are concerned. If a student is assaulted and fails
to report the incident and swear out a complaint, he endangers
the well-being of all other students. If the assailants are not ar-
rested or even accused, it is almost assured that more students
will be attacked. We strongly urge all students who are attacked
to report immediately to the Lexington police, so this epidemic

of muggings can be stopped.

We wish to correct the statement in last week’s editorial,

entitled “An Armed Camp?”,

that the administration is un-

concerned and inactive in regard to these attacks. Meetings
with University Proctor Bob Murray have been held by the
Administration almost daily since these latest incidents started.
It is the desire of the Administration that students who are
attacked cooperate with them in their efforts to stop these
muggings by reporting to the police, as stated above.

Any students who think that they can effectively deal with
the problem by arming themselves should leave their guns
in the closet. If a student is attacked by fists, he may not shoot
his assailant and hope to avoid presecution himself. Concealed

weapons, moreover, are illegal.

Any students currently playing roles out of Ian Fleming

are urged to disarm themselves

at once, before they are pun-

ished with even greater severity than would be meted out to

oven the most brutal townie thug.

The Constructive Uses of Traditions

By JOHN M. GUNN, JR.
Assistant Professor of Economics
Mere tradition is a vain inherit-

ance. Striving to maintain a tradi-
tion for tradition’s sake is wasted
effort. Putting on a tradition in
an attempt to clothe itself in the
prestige of old age may sap a com-
munity of much of its vitality,

On the other hand, when tradi-
tions can help a community toward
larger achievement of its own critical
examined objectives, those traditions
are worth preserving, especially if
the community be one of young per-
sonalities who are achieving their
own maturity.

I believe that thousands of Wash-
ington and Lee men have been heirs
to real and worth benefits, conferred
upon them, in part, through the
medium of tradition.

The Honor System stands apart
as an ennobling tradition. Here I will

 

write no more of it than to say that
judged from the limits of my ex-
perience and according to my stand-
ards of value, the Washington and
Lee Honor System is the most out-
standing single feature of this, or
any other, educational institution—
a marvelous engine for the develop-
ment of integrity and responsibility
in all who are associated with the
University. It takes a while for fresh-
man students and new faculty mem-
bers to appreciate its force and
depth, and some doubtless miss its
lessons altogether. However, most
members of the University are in-
fluenced by it; and some have their
lives literally transformed through
the experience of living under the
Honor System.

On a different level are several
other traditions of the University
whose constructive benefits have
been less essential but nonetheless

Montgomery Probes Facts |
Of Mickey Isikoff A {fair

By WARREN MONTGOMERY
Mickey Isikoff is a ZBT sopho-
more to whom the Executive Com-
mittee has given
four weeks of so-
cial probation for
repeatedly wear-
ing non-conven-
tional dress. The
known objective
facts of the case
are that Isikoff was
twice sent before
the Assimilation
Committee for
: : warning and then
Montgomery sent to the E.C
because he persisted in his ways
The most pertinent aspects of the
case have yet to be presented, how-
The salient features of the
Isikoff case are: (1) Mickey Isikoff
neither expected nor had any rea-
son to expect the severity of the
penality meted out to him: (2) of
all the blatantly sloppy dressers on
campus, Isikoff alone has received
strong punishment; and (3) there is
strong reason to believe that Isikoff
has been the target of a small group

I believe that the E.C. cannot be
accused of inequity, except inso-

the punishment is concerned. The
Executive Committe definitely had to
punish Isikoff,

Can Mickey Isikoff blamed?
Yes, to the extent that he was guilty
of violating conventional dress, and
to that extent he deserved being dis-
ciplined. But if Mickey was to be
punished, he should have been giv-
en to expect that the discipline might
be severe. He was not, of course,
because no one on campus expected
such severity. Furthermore, if Mick-

real: gentlemanly behavior, — the
friendly greetings, and conventional
dress. No instant traditions, these.
All have lives a century old, or
older. The aggregate effect of num-
erous decisions by individuals within
the next several weeks may de-
termine whether some or all of these
traditions will continue in this Uni-
versity.
Gentlemanly Behavior

H. W. Fowler describes “genteel”
as a word now used only by the ig-
norant, except in mockery—a “wor-
sened word,” in its fit phrase. If that
be so, our language is the poorer for
the change, and our lives are poorer
for the worsened behavior that seems
to have accompanied the deprecia-
tion of the word.

When President Lee laid down his
“one rule here,” “To be a gentleman”
was understood to encompass a man’s
total behavior. It did not then imply
effectation of a detached smoothness
while indulging one’s sensous tastes.
It did not give young men leave to
sow a few patches of wild oats, even
if sown with a measure of delicacy,
or at least, of discretion. It did not
depend upon affluence, and it did not

It DID imply respect for the rights,
the opinions, and the sensitivities of
others. It DID involve the SPIRIT, as
well as the practice, of courtesy. It
DID demand respect for law and
established authority, including both
civil and institutional authority.

However, it did not inhibit honest!

disagreement or respectful criticism
of authority, and it would not ex-
clude civil disobedience in a sincere
cause of justice. At its best, the con-
cept of gentlemanly behavior re-
quired nobility and generosity in a
man’s total behavior.

No one expects that college stu-
dents will never offend. To do so
would be to mistake their role
students. One may

often, in total, nor repeatedly in the

by saying, “Well, he was drunk.” If
a man loses his self-control after a
“couple of drinks,” he has a good
reason not to drink; he has no ex-
cuse to behave in an ungentlemanly
manner,

Although the tradition of gentle-
manly behavior has not been a sub-

its deterioration has been as markd
as the decline of the custom of ex-

the erosion of conventional dress.
Moreover, it may well be that these
coincident declines are casually re-
lated.

you will not gain the capacity to

Kline Urges Assimilation
Committee Strengthening

By JODY KLINE

The current debate over the
dition of conventional dress has been
confused by the fact that some peo-
ple are arguing about the degener-
acy of a students while others are
questioning the effectiveness of the
Assimilation Committee, and up un-
. , til now there has

tra-

been no accurate
investigation to
determine if the

latter agency has
been the cause of
a weakened em-
phasis on conven-
tional dress.

At the Execu-
tive Committee
meeting of Feb-
ruary 21, student
body president Fred Mindel stated
that there were three possible
courses of action regarding the status
quo of the Assimilation Committee
1) It could be left as it is at present
2) It could be abolished. 3) It could
be reinvested with fining powers.

Now what will probably happen in
each of these cases.

If the Assimilation Committee is
left the way it is now- student dress-
ing habits will remain the way they
now, or even worse, will con-
tinue to degenerate at the at
which they have been for the past
several years

Questions

Secondly, if the Assimilation Com-
mittee is abolished can we actually
expect an improvement in conven-
tional dress? How many students at
Wa&L intentionally

protest against rules that supposedly

these customs can help mobilize
one’s effors for effective study.
Hence, the well-tied tie and the
well-spoken salute may help en-
large one’s appreciation of Goethe
or his knowledge of interstellar space
after all. Such feedback from dress
and manners to narrowly defined
“academic” performance is probably
small, but there is significant evi-
dence that it is often real. The con-
tribution to self-esteem and self-
confidence is, itself, of more funda-
mental importance.

Wearing a necktie is neither a
necessary condition, nor a sufficient
one, to neatness in dress; indeed,
some students are able to wear ties
in a manner that proclaims defiance
of neatness. However, wearing a coat,
a tie, and a pair of socks, DOES
have the advantage of being opera-
tionally easy to classify, whereas
“neatness” is subject to difficulty in

ultimate, the maximum authority
conceivable to punish violators.

Honor System

Now I suppose that one time the
Honor System was also criticized and
students claimed that expulsion from
the university was too harsh a pun-
itive action. But students began to
realize the responsibility that the
Honor System placed on them and
slowly the violations became less
frequent, and when they did oc-
cur were considered a breach of a
very important student obligation.

In this way the Honor System
evolved from a set of regulations
into an expected mode of be-
havior. At this point students no
longer obeyed the Honor System
because of fear but because it ques-
tioned their sense of responsibility
and maturity—it became at that time
a tradition.

Return to Fines

I suggest that the idea of con-
ventional dress can be developed in
the same way. With re-established
fining powers, the Assimilation Com-
mittee can halt the decline of stu-
dent dress habits, providing that the
students take an increased interested
in their university and become more
conscious of violators of the dress
regulations.

At the same time the Assimila-
tion Committee can spend more time
inculeating the freshman with the
idea of conventional dress as a tra-
dition rather than a habit that
we have all conformed to.

This program, I feel, should should
bring about the development of con-
ventional dress as a tradition equal
in acceptance to the Honor System
within a period of a few years.

167 lb. was pinned in the third
period of his match. Hugh Baugher,
177 lb. followed but trailed his
opponent by a near fall, bringing
the score to 36-0 for U.Va.

Raker Wins

Well, with one match to go the
pride of W&L rested solely on
Homes Raker, wrestling heavy-
weight.. Homes came through and
easily took the five points from
U.Va. bringing the final score to
36-5.

On the whole, this season has
been a fair one for the 65-66 wrest-
ling team. The seniors ended up well,
winning most of their matches. The
majority of the rest of the team,
and a good part of the Junior Var-
sity consists of freshmen. With a
bit more experience, these boys will
probably lead the team to many
good seasons in the future.

 

Examines Dress;

interpretation. In fact, the tradition
of Conventional Dress has usually
accomplished a high degree of neat-
ness in the appearance of W&L
men, both individually and collec-
tively. It is an appearance that is in
marked contrast to the dirty Tee-
shirts, which are the conventional
dress of many colleges, or the dirty
chinos, which are the conventional
dress of others.

In addition to the salutary effects
on individual students, shared tra-
ditions have contributed much to a
spirit of unity in the Washington
and Lee Student Body, the Faculty,
and the Alumni of the University.
The speaking tradition, especially,
has helped make real the advertised
benefits of a small student body, and
it has served to expand the range
of a student’s friendships.

Whatever its other values, or lack

of value, the exchange of greetings
has been a practice that warmed the
heart.
The constructive traditions of
Washington and Lee have brought
tangible benefits to its students, quite
apart from their aid in developing
the character of the individual. These
traditions have helped students de-
velop the personal qualities that can
make their technical competence
more effective in advancing their
own interests and the interests of so-
ciety. They have been a major at-
traction in the University’s efforts
to enroll good students, in compe-
tition with other recognized institu-
tions. They have assisted in attract-
ing to the University strong addi-
tions to the faculty. The traditions,
and the goals they seek to advance,
have contributed to a bond between
Faculty and University which has
held at Washington and Lee some
Faculty members, including some
of those admired most by students,
who have received offers from more
prestigious institutions, at higher
salaries than they were paid here.

The appearance and behavior of
W&L students have prompted com-
ment from almost all those who
have visited the campus to interview
applicants for graduate and profes-
sional schools and for employment.
While one would hope admission
to the leading graduate schools and
employment by dynamic corporations
would be determined by things more
fundamental than the style of a
man’s dress, there is no doubt that
W&L men have been favored in
their applications by the distinctions
recruiters have observed between
this campus and most others.

Almost all students want this Uni-
versity to be distinctive. It is an
ironic fact that many would forfeit
the very things that have given it
distinction, rather than make the
small effort needed in adjusting their
personal habits to maintain the high
standards of the past.

If traditions seeking to promote
gentility and graciousness were pro-
posed as substitutes for integrity
and responsibility, intellectual vi-
tality, and scholarly evcellence, such
exchange would be a poor bargain.
The leadership of the University has
never contemplated such substitu-
tion, however, and I think these tra-
ditions have not distracted from the
University's primary objectives, even
unconsciously. Rather, the traditions
of gentlemanly behavior (according
to Lee's conception of it), of courtesy
on the campus, and of high standards
in personal appearance have been
esteemed as complements of good
academic performance, contributing

that primary goal, and enhancing in
total the value of a man’s collegiate
experience.

The late President Gaines, who
set for Washington and Lee the
objective of developing in its stu-
dents “something a little finer than
competence,” once said that a meas-
ure of the intangibles that distin-
guish superior colleges and univer-
sities is the force of their construc-
tive traditions, Washington and Lee
has had few peers in exhibiting
such force, Will the University pre-
serve its exceptional “intangibles”?

for having had an ancestor in the re-
mote past who was an oligarch. If
“aristocracy” can be attained as
easily as wearing a strip of cloth
around one’s neck, and a hypocriti-
cal smile on one’s mug, it certainly
can not be too far above the “mass of
common  non-conformism.” What
heritage is there in a white collar,
when any delivery boy can wear one,
when anyone can ape “gentlemanly
deportment?”
A Personal View

Personally, I'm going to continue,

poll or not, to wear, of my own

 

 

choice, a coat and/or tie to classes
and a couple other places. I could
care less what anyone else does or
does not do. When I meet a person, I
try not to judge him by his clothes
or facial expression or small-talk,
but to accept him as an individual
apart from any standards of “gentle-
manliness” which my social class has
tried to establish. If in doing so I
descend into the clutches of the red
international anti-tie conspiracy,
that’s my problem, and I'll accept
the consequences, however horrible
they may be.

Yours,

“Well ...some, I believe, have said

“We do have an aggressive policy.
Surely we do. As you know, we go

And some of these high schools are

“Who wants to be a leader in
Southern education? Why change

“I guess you're right.”

About this time I had finished my

out of the Co-op toward the scenic
campus of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, happy that our administra-
tion was in such capable hands, and
happy that all was white with God's
world.

found guilty, fined, and given sus-

will have also irreparably weakened

we will substitute individual prefer-

Let us hope that in the forthcom-

‘Richard I” Termed|
‘Opulent Spectacle’

By GEORGE W. RAY
Instructor in English

Some people thought it absurd for a new Troubadour director to open
with Waiting for Godot, I disagree. In fact, the choice of Beckett’s mod-
ern classic was a sane and conservative one, but it most emphatically is
absurd to follow Godot with Richard Il, a taxing play to produce and
direct even under the best of conditions.

Consider for a moment the two overwhelming local handicaps against
a successful production of a Shakespearean play: a narrow, claustropho-
bic proscenium stage which does not remotely resemble the open, multi-
layered, and admirably flexible Elizabethan stage on which Shakespeare's
plays were acted, and the lack of an experienced company to cope with
the special requirements of Shakespeare’s verse. Many members of the
cast are freshmen and sophomores playing their maiden roles; only two
members of the approximately thirty players are members of the national
honorary dramatic fraternity.

Yet, in the face of these formidable obstacles, “this happy breed of
men” (and women), under the sure-handed and imaginative direction of
Mr. Lee Kahn, has brought it off handsomely, The production, utilizing
the recently-installed revolving stage, is magnificently mounted, and pro-
vides the audience, quite literally, with a moveable visual feast. But,
in addition to the opulent spectacle expected of Shakespeare's histories,
the appreciative opening-night audience witnessed surprisingly strong and
sensitive interpretations of the major roles, Richard and Bolingbroke.

The basic stage props consist of a raised platform, a set of stairs, and
six pillars arranged in a semi-circle on the revolving stage. Alternately
adorned with curtains or heraldic emblems, the pillars suggest scene lo-
cations—a private room, the throneroom, the tournament site, a prison
cell—but they also function symbolically, as in Gaunt’s apostrophe to
represent “this demi-paradise” or to suggest a giant coronet within which
we literally see the flatterers whom Gaunt figuratively describes earlier
as sitting within Richard’s crown. The platform functions not only as a
castle wall but it also gives a vertical dimension to the stage which vis-
ually reinforces Richard's descent to the “base court” of unkinged hu-
manity.

As functional as these aspects of the staging are, however, the effective-
ness of the revolving stage seems questionable, at least in the case of a large
cast show not using an apron for extra floor space. Although the “re-
volve” does facilitate scene changes, it also severely limits stage space
since only the front half of the stage can be used at any one time.

Don Baker, in the title role, wisely avoids the temptation to play Rich-
ard as tragic hero. Instead, he offers a Richard long overdue for the
psychoanalyst’s couch, an arrested adolescent whose self-manipulating
narcissism paradoxically precludes any growth to real self-discovery and
manhood. Baker, who resembles a pre-degenerate Peter O'Toole, is well-
cast as the egocentric, self-pitying, spoiled playboy, and he effectively
projects Richard’s essentially self-destructive nature through effective ges-
ture, facial movement, and vocal modulation.

Jay Cady is convincing as the ambitious Bolingbroke capitalizing on
the power vacuum created by Richard's misrule. Playing against Baker's
effete Richard unsuited for the heavy burdens of kingship (emphasized
by the “business” with the crown in the deposition scene), Cady presents
a virile energetic young duke who matures to exhibit his abilities as a
stable ruler. Though at the end a less sympathetic character as a human
being than Richard, Cady's Bolingbroke does assure us that the realm is
finally in capable hands.

Tim Webster, playing the aged loyal counsellor, John of Gaunt, gives
a steady performance and an especially arresting, dynamically appropriate
rendition of the famous patriotic paean of England. As the Gardener,
Professor Keith Shillington once again amply demonstrates that he is at
home in both cultures. His horticultural advice makes explicit the serious
political import of the play, but ironically provides the only moments of
levity in an otherwise humorless play. Lew Davis, Jim Settle, Betty Kahn,
Lock Handley and Jeb Brown also render competent support in subsidiary
roles although Brown, it must be noted, brings the play dangerously close
to melodrama by overplaying Bolingbroke’s arrogant “hatchetman,” the
Earl of Northumberland. Such an interpretation reduces the central con-

Question of NSA A ffiliation
Debated by ODK Forum

By RUSTY MEYER

On Wednesday evening in Lee
Chapel the newly re-organized ODK
leadership forum sponsored a debate
on W&L’s proposed membership in
the National Student Association. A
referendum on this subject will be
held today.

Of the four speakers who appear-
ed, only one, Geoff Wainscott, was a
student on campus. The other three
were Joyce Riddle, president of stu-
dent government at Hollins; Phil
Sherbourne, national president ol
NSA; and Tom Pauken, chairman ol
the College Young Republican Fed-
eration.

The discussion was organized in

the form of a debate. Pauken andj noble
Wainscott, vice-chairman of the YR's| but that there is a vast difference

at W&L argued against membership;
Riddle and Sherbourne defended the
proposal.

In the next hour the two propon-
ents of NSA brought forth at least
five factors which they claimed made
the association worthy of the consid-
eration of our student body. First,

since its foundation in 1947 by sever-| convention ol

al veterans, the group has received
the endorsement of such national fig-
ures as John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B
Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Everett
Dirksen

The newly elected members will
be initiated in early April following
the University’s annual Phi Beta
Kappa-Society of the Cincinnati
Convocation. Shortened classes will
be held so that students can attend
the voluntary assembly honoring
the Phi Beta Kappa men.

Phi Beta Kappa is the oldest Greek
letter fraternity in the United States.
It was founded at William and Mary
in 1776. Early secrecy was aban-
doned after criticism, and since 1846
the society has been strictly an hon-
orary scholastic fraternity. Mem-
bership in Phi Beta Kappa has long
been one of the highest academic
distinctions.

The purpose of the organization is
to recognize and encourage scholar-
ship and cultural interests. Qualifi-
cations for membership are high
scholastic average, liberal culture
and good character

Gamma Chapter

Washington and Lee’s local chap-
ter, Gamma of Virginia, was founded
in 1911 with ten members. Since that
date, the chapter has annually con-
ferred membership on students with
outstanding academic records. It now
has over 700 living members

Gamma Chapter considers each
graduating class by itself, not by
comparison with other classes. Elec-
tion is not based on any fixed per-
of the class and there is no
numerical requirement for

$15 per year and would cover any
and all services.

In reply, Wainscott and Pauken
brought out a number of facts that
changed the complexion of the mat-
ter a great deal. First, they pointed
out that most politicians endorse
such organizations as a matter of
good public relations, even though
they do not fully undertand the in-
tricacies of the group. Pauken said
that only last week a government of-
ficial phoned him and asked him
what NSA was, because he was
writing a letter wishing it well.

 

Second, Wainscott attacked the
manner in which NSA operates. He
said that he has no objection to the
idealism embodied in NSA,

between what the organization claims
to offer and its working structure. He
pointed out that NSA is not the most
representative form of student opin-
ion possible, as exemplified by the
fact that it is only composed of 325
schools, and of these only 45 per cent
sent members to the policy making
1963. He then

for the U.S. to withdraw troops from
the Republic; to desist
from bombing North Viet Nam; and

Girls-In-Dorm
Aired by SAC

The Student Affairs Committee
deadlocked in a 6-6 vote yesterday
afternoon in its consideration of the
E.C.’s “Girls-in-the-dorms” resolu-
tion, and decided that the resolution,
as amended by it, should be present-
ed to the Faculty at its regular meet-
ing this Monday, for final action on
the proposal.

Law students Jack Ford and John
Peck presented the original petition,
after which the E.C. resolution was
explained by Junior Class represen-
tative Bill Jeffress. Lengthy discus-
sion saw the resolution altered to
include statements that the regis-
ters to be signed by students who
would be taking girls into their
rooms “must indicate either that:
a) the door be left open at least
one foot, or that b) there are present
in the room at least two females....
Abuse of the privilege by any stu-
dent will result in his appearance
before the Student Affairs Commit-
tee. The Executive Committee of the
Student Body agrees to consider fal-
sification of the register a matter
subject to the Honor System.
Students are obligated to respect the
rights of other dormitory residents
and the rules of the various girls’
schools in using this privilege.”

Arguments presented in favor of
the change of dormitory regulations
included statements that upperclass
dorm students have little opportuni-
ty to entertain dates, that numerous
other men’s schools permit girls in
their dorms, and that Wé&L students
are “gentlemen” capable of intelli-
gent and discretionary use of such a
privilege. Opposing arguments con-
tended that all dorm students at
W&L live in the dorms voluntarily,
whereas at most of the schools al-
lowing girls in the dorms, living in
is required; that only 23 per cent of
non-fraternity upperclassmen and
16 per cent af all law students act-
ually live in the dorms here; that
the projected student union will
supply many of the needed facilities
for all non-fraternity students; and
that W&L has no responsibility to
supply facilities for sex (the state-
ment “we admit that such actions
are likely to occur” made by back-
ers of the resolution was quoted)

Friday Edition

WG L Herttage

The present struggle over conventional dress has a far
deeper meaning to us than the outward appearance of the
W&L student. What we are engaged in is fundamentally a
conflict of beliefs and intangibles, and the present manifesta-
tion of that conflict is the issue of conventional dress.

Washington and Lee tradition is a mystique. It cannot be
analyzed, disected, or stated in purely logical terms. It is a
sense of heritage, of lineal continuity with a great past, and
of present dignity of the individual. It embraces intangibles
such as honor, responsibility, gentility, and duty—that entire
magnificent social structure which characterized America of
Lee’s day.

We realize that times have changed; we know that the old
world and values of Lee are nearly gone. But we feel at Wash-
ington and Lee, at least, the great heritage can be preserved
without damage to intelligent thought or academic excellence.

In defending conventional dress, we are defending a be-
lief, not a system of logic. We are defending that entire heri-
tage of which gentlemanly dress is a small but significant part,
and we see great practical and spiritual value in protecting
that heritage here at W&L.

We realize that many do not agree with the heritage, and
that their opinions are honest and sincere. We are grateful to
these people for forcing us to think about our values because
in examining and understanding them, we can hold them more
intelligently and consciously. But we also wish the critics of
our traditions to realize that in attacking conventional dress,
they are attacking the whole system of traditions that is W&L’s
inheritance of a century and a half and a way of life, even to-

 

day.

So to those who would like to alter our our traditions: we
respect your position and arguments, but we also believe that
they are wrong. We welcome your dissent as a stimulant to
thought, but we hope that we may always maintain our distinc-
tive traditions in spite of dissent. And we understand your rea-
sons for wishing to change W&L, but we feel that they are
and that the valuable spirit of W&L

 

more valid elsewhere
should be retained here.

Dress Enforcement

The Friday Edition believes that the attempt to disassociate
enforcement of conventional dress with the tradition of con-
ventional dress is fallacious. The issue at stake is whether or not
a few individuals have the right to defy the traditions of the
University. If conventional dress is not enforced, these indi-
viduals will be given leave to ignore the wishes of the majority
and thereby weaken the effectiveness of the tradition. The
Friday edition supports both conventional dress and its en-
forcement by the Assimilation Committee.

Awad Pleads For Open-Mindedness
In Evaluating Enforced Dress Rules

By JIM AWAD
It wasn’t too long ago that W&L

almost solved the Conventional
Dress problem: The Assimilation
Committee existed in name, but as
an organization,
it was, for all

practical purposes,
defunct; at the
same time, a large
majority of stu-
dents were wear-
ing coats and ties
to classes.

The EC ripped
the controversy
open again,
though, by placing
a student on soc-
ial probation for his failure to ob-
serve conventional dress rules. Since
then, there has been a barrage of
literature supporting the EC’s de-
cision, conventional dress, and tra-
dition. It is about time for someone
to express the views of the “other
side.”

Without a doubt, the EC ruling
was within the bounds of existing
rules, and no one can criticize the
EC for exercising the regulations
they themselves put into effect. One
could ask why they waited so long
to exercise their powers, for there
are more than two hundred students

Awad

 

who substituted ski-parkas and|
sweaters for sport coats, but that |
would be kicking a dead horse. In- |
stead, let’s get at the roots of the|
problem:
Pro Argument
The essential argument of those in

power of the EC decision and of
strict enforcement of conventional
dress is that W&L is a school of

 

gentlemen. We wear coats and ties,
live by an honor system, and speak
to each other when passing by. “It
is tradition which makes this school
distinctive and great,” is their battle-
cry. I would like to attack this ar-
gument step by step:

Attack

First of all, no one would ques-
tion the absolute value of tradition
whether at a university, high school,
a business enterprise, or in a nation. |
There is something about tradition
which lends continuity to a fast-
moving and often chaotic world. But
is it tradition that makes a school
great?

So often the “old guard” at this
university answer in the affirmative
to this question; but they are pitiful-
ly mistaken. College is supposed to
be a time when an individual de-
termines what his place in the world,
will be. He is supposed to be ex-
posed to philosophies and beliefs of |
all kinds so that he may choose those |
which he will call his own.

 

The only way that one can attain
this total exposure is through the
decisive clashing of ideas in and out
of the classroom. Unfortunately, you
won't find this clashing of ideas out-
side of the classroom unless it is
preceded by an exposure within the
classroom itself.

Furthermore, before you
have stimulating classes, you must
have excellent, dedicated professors
interested students

can

and

Academic Excellence
What this boils down to, then, is

 

what? Washington and Lee is fail-
ing miserably in this area. If Wash-
ington and Lee is so great, where is
the stimulation in the classroom?
You know right well that 75 per
cent of the students here want noth-
ing more than diploma, and if some
do want more than that, all they
want is good grades. Furthermore, if
Washington and Lee is so great, why
aren't the best students in the coun-
try applying here, instead of too
Harvard, Yale, Penn, etc. If Wash-
ington and Lee is so great, where are
the devoted alumni who could very
easily give us the money we need
for a decent library, a better ath-
letic program, a student union, more
research facilities, and better pay
for our professors.

Gentlemen, I am not asking you
to abandon your tradition. What I
am asking you to do is to realize that
while traditions are an asset, they
are not distinguishing characteristics
that make a university great. Like
it or not, it is academic excellence
that does this,

Disdain for Individuality

Secondly, I would like to point out
that, unfortunately, those who ideal-
ize traditions are, in fact, preventing
W&L from becoming the great uni-
versity it could be. You insist that
everybody dress the same, act the
same, and, consequently, whether
you realize it or not, think the same.
In your idealistic search for a school
of gentlemen, you step on anyone
who seems to fall out of line. The re-
sult is a disdain for excess individu-
ality. The point is, that individuality
ought to be cherished and encour-
aged, for it is only through such in-
dividuality that you are going to get
the clashing of ideas cited above.

At this point you may say that
making exeryone dress the same
does not discourage individuality.
All I can ask you to do is to take
a look around you—look at the
facts. Whether it follows logically or
not, a state of affairs has come to
exist at W&L where everyone is the
same: If you show too much inter-

 

 

est in class or study too much, you're

 

Tokio, Japan

a flamer; if you don’t dress like ev-
eryone else, you’re a “grub;” and
if your political convictions are a
little too far to the left, you're a
socialist, and if they’re a little too
far to the right, you’re a reactionary.
In essence, there are no visible
signs of individuality at W&L. No
doubt, the common socio-economic
background of the large majority of
students is a factor in this, but blind
allegiance to tradition and conform-
ity also plays a part.
Clothes Do Not Make A Gentleman

Thirdly, while some run around
campus trying to make gentlemen of
every one else, they are, in effect,
accomplishing nothing. What I am
getting at is that it’s not clothing that
makes an individual a gentleman
(I’m more convinced of this every
time I see someone in a coat and tie
“drop trow” in front of a bunch of
girls). True, conventional dress does
look nice, but it still doesn’t make a
gentleman out of you. A student
wearing a sweater and ski-parka

Tie Trips Halfback

By CHARLIE BENSINGER
Dear Mom and Dad,

As did Dr. Phillips, who by the
way was one of the most entertain-
ing speakers that I have heard in
four years at W&L, I had a dream.
The year was
j 1966, the day that

| of the final game
' on the W&L foot-
_ ball schedule. The
| winner would be
i the new CAC.
| champion, rated
next to the lead-
| ed in the A.P. and
UPI. polls, but
the Generals were
losing by four
points with only
seconds left to play.

But then, with a burst of speed,
a General halfback broke into the
clear, racing toward the end zone
and the championship. The ball car-
rier neared the goal-line, and then
it happened, he was tackled—by his
TIE, trailing out behind him.

Washington and Lee lost the game
and the title, but even worse, the
halfback lost his tie, was assimilat-
ed, and then was, as law prevailed,
suspended from school.

Imagine that—halfback Mickey
Isikoff playing on Wilson field out
of uniform. What is the “W&L gen-
tleman” coming to?

be made available to six members
of the E.C. upon request at the

Ping-pong is here, but what hap-

Next on the agenda are softball

before they run out. It’s a lot eas-

Trivia Contest Rules, Dates Announced

By CLARK KENT
Mild-Mannered Reporter
Thursday, March 17, has been set
as the date for the First Annual In-
according

 

When friends from the University
of Kentucky ask with a knowing
smirk “And how did the Washing-
ton and Lee Basketball Team do
this year?,” don’t hang your head
and mutter that we won 40 per cent
of our games. Stand tall, thrust out
your chest and declare stentorianly
“We just won 500 per cent more
games than last year.”

Yes, fans, with a 10 and 15 record
this year, the Generals are on their
way up. And with much of the team
returning, and, as Coach Verne Can-
field puts it “excellent recruiting
prospects” the team should contin-
ue to climb.

The keys to this year’s improve-
ment were undoubtedly team spirit
and team play. According to Can-
field, “There was no one star; each
boy played a starring role in at least
one game.”

Repeating last year’s victory over
North Carolina Wesleyan, the Gen-
erals also defeated Lynchburg Col-
lege (twice), R.P.1. (twice), Eastern
Mennonite (twice), Towson Siate,
Emory and Henry, and Southwest-
ern in the CAC Tournament last
week.

Statistically speaking, in twenty-
five games W&L scored 1823 points
to their opponents’ 1954, a per-game
average of 72.9 to 78.2. This breaks
down to 704 for 1748 from the field
(40.3 per cent) and 415 for 629 from
the foul line (66 per cent). The op-
posing teams were 752 for 1790 from
the field (42 per cent) and 450 for
633 from the foul line (71.1 per cent).
The Generals out-rebounded their
opponents 1343 to 1116, an average of
53.7 to 44.7 per game.

Coach Happy With Cage Season
As Generals Double Win Total

Freshman Rob Bauer led in the
scoring column with 371 points, av-
eraging 15.5 per game. Bauer was
followed by Frank Morrison with
265 (12.6) per game) and Bob Spes-
sard with 238 points, or an average
of 9.5 per game.

Last year the Generals were 2
17, defeating only Old Dominion and
North Carolina Wesleyan. The team
averaged 764 points per game
against their opponents’ 91.2 indi-
eating an immense improvement on
defense.

Canfield was relatively pleased
with the season, although it did not
come up to his pre-season hopes of
thirteen wins and twelve defeats.
The Coach asserted that there were
“a few we lost that we should and
could have had, such as UNC of
Charlotte.” W&L lost this one 76
to 78.

When asked about recruiting, Can-
field claimed that it was going “very
well,” pointing to a list of “possibles”
on his office wall, including one boy
rated best in his state. Canfield re-
turns from a recruiting trip today.

to the official rules released today
by Michael Anthony, secretary to
the producers. The preliminary com-
petition, which will consist of fifty
written questions, will be given on
Monday, March 14,

A total of six confirmed entries
have been received so far. In ad-
dition to the Phi Gam, Kappa Sig,
and NFU teams announced last
week, freshmen Bern Bonifant and
Robert Moselle will represent Phi
Ep; Tom Doss and Steve Saunders
compete for SPE; and Paul Schles-
inger and journalist Charlie “Dear
Mom and Dad” Bensinger will up-
hold the honor of ZBT.

According to athletic expert Gil-
bert Thorp, who is handicapping the
teams, the ZBT entry has to be
rated as the favorite at this time on
the basis of superior conditioning.
“There’s an unknown factor here,
though,” Thorp said. “We under-
stand that some member of the ad-
ministration, possibly Frank Parsons,
considering entering a faculty
team. Such a team would definitely
be a force to be reckoned with.”

Deadline for entries is Thursday,
March 10.

1. The preliminary quiz may be
taken at any time between 3 at!

Is

 

 

5 p.m., on Monday, March 14 in Reid
Hall. It will consist of fifty written
questions, to be worked on by the
team as a unit with a time limit of
twenty minutes,

2. The final competition will take
place Thursday, March 17 from 9 to
9:30 in the Home Edition studio,
and will be conducted according to
College Bowl rules.

3. Questions may be drawn from
the following categories: television,
radio, comic strips, comic books,
children’s books, old movies, sports,
and rock and roll.

4, Questions will be of three ord-
ers of difficulty: Difficult, Impossible,
and Unreal.

Awad Discusses Dress Rules

(Continued from page 2)

can very well be more of a gentle-
man than one in a coat and tie.

Fourth, some claim that a coat and
tie makes one look neat. All I can
say to them is that there are a hell-
of-a-lot of students running around
here in sweaters and ski parkas who
are a lot neater than many wearing
coats and ties. You are simply not
going to make a guy dress more
neatly because you insist he wear
a coat and tie. It is a matter of per-
sonal values: a person who likes
to “dress well” will be neat, wheth-
er he has on a coat and tie or not;
and a person who doesn’t care that
much about his personal appear-
ance is not going to look neat,
whether he has a coat and tie or not.

Assimilation Committee

Fifthly, there’s the matter of the
Assimilation Committee. Whereas
the spirit of conventional dress is ac-
ceptable and even admirable, the As-
similation Committee, no matter how
you look at it, is detestable.

There is absolutely no moral, ethi-
cal, or practical basis for fining a stu-
dent or put him on social pro for not
wearing a coat and tie. If some of the
students at W&L like to wear coats
and ties—fine. As I have said, this is
admirable. But why do they have to
impose their values on others? They
may try to reason with a “non-be-
liever,” they may argue with him,
and they may set an example for
them, but who do they have to cruci-
fy him? And on top of that, why do
they make him pay a dollar? Is there
any connection between money and
not believing in what someone else
believes? Maybe they’re trying to
intimidate “non-believers” or try-
ing to take so much money from

At any rate, the dollar fine has
been abolished, but in its place has

(From bad to worse). Now I ask,
“are they realizing the importance
of fraternities at W&L, by forbidding
a student from entering a fraterni-
ty house for four weeks because he
doesn’t believe in what they believe
in?” Ardently they are. I would like
to know what they are going to do
with a student they’ve placed on

coat and tie. Maybe they’ll suspend
him from school.

The idiocy of their actions speaks
for itself. All I have to say to them
is: Believe in what you want to be-
lieve in; and try to convince others
of the validity of your belief, but
don’t go around putting guys in so-
cial pro because they don’t agree
with you.

I could see doing so if the “non-
believers” actions actually hurt so-
ciety, but, being realistic, I don’t
think wearing a sweater instead of
a coat and tie hurts anybody, espec-
ially if the student wearing the
sweater is neat, and if he’s not, well,
that is his business. No matter how
much some are concerned with the
appearance of the student body as a
whole, they have no right to force
others to dress according to their
standards. Instead, as I have said
above, argue and set an example.

Above all, let us remain open-
minded.

ment should have been, Even Mick-
ey Isikoff will agree to that. Yet, so-
cial probation for a one month peri-
od entails some $70 expenses for
room and board and an _ untold
amount of inconvenience. It is, to
say the least, a very strict penalty.

In a few days, W&L students will
have the opportunity to express their
opinions on the Isikoff case. Each
student will have a vote as to
whether he thinks Isikoff's penalty
should be lessened or not. Every
Washington and Lee student has an
obligation to vote one way or the
other at this assembly. It will be a
deplorable situation if the student
body passes up its obligation be-
cause of apathy.

terizes so much of American edu-
cation.” That is to say, W-L’s main
distinction is that its students “vol-
untarily” (to quote the catalogue)
dress like “adults.”

Without this, it is apparently
feared, we might be indistinguishable
from the “mass of common non-con-
formism” (Berkeley? Wisconsin?
Ambherst?), the students composing
which have lost their individuality,
evidently, and all look alike because
they don’t wear ties. I would suggest
that if it is W-L’s unique individu-
ality that is at stake here, there are
all kinds of things which could be
instituted to prevent it from falling
into the pit of non-identity: like ev-
eryone could wear a purple beanie or
one red sock or white gloves—the
possibilities are infinite.

But this wouldn’t do—for the
whole point is, I take it, that W-L
boys dress like ADULTS, not like
mere students. Why this “value”
“manifestly deserves to be perpetu-
ated” (bold type mine) has not yet
been manifested to me, but I am wil-
ling to accept the possibility that I
am simply out of it.

What is more disturbing is the edi-
torial writer’s belief that there is a
minority conspiracy afoot to “snow-
ball the passive (sheeplike?) major-
ity into abandoning concepts of great
value.” If these people, he says
“simply stressing the importance of

 

individuality” (obviously, a minor
unimportant virtue) they could be—
“ignored” (after all, everybody
knows that old gambit; nothing
threatening here) or (reluctantly)
“even supported.” But this isn’t the
case. What these wantonly destruc-
tive individuals are doing is under-
mining “W-L’s greatest asset and
distinction” (conventional dress). If
it is true that the coat and tie uni-
form is our “greatest asset,” one
which alone gives W-L its unique
identity as an institution, seems to
me the time has come to abandon the
ship.

ODK Leadership Forum Holds
Debate On N.S.A. Membership

(Continued from page 1)
for the U.S. to introduce Red China
for membership before the U.N. In
addition, NSA has voiced opposition
to the American college fraternity
system.

Equally important is the fact that
the NSA opinions cannot be revised.
Its structure is such that those pres-
ently in control do not favor chan-
ges, and they can effectively prevent
them.

Third, NSA in fact can do little
for W&L. As an example, Wainscott
referred to an incident at Lawrence
College where student leaders dis-
covered that speakers and movies
provided by NSA could have been
obtained from individual groups for

 

much less.

Fourth is the fact that there is
growing displeasure with NSA
among numerous groups. Several
fraternity leaders have spoken out
against it. Thirty-three major col-
leges have tried the organization and
quit. Over a dozen others decided
against joining at all. In several
instances even NSA section leaders
have admitted a lack of effective-
ness.

And last is the fact that expen-
ses run far above the $15 base. Reg-
istration for conventions is $35, and
most schools including Hollins spend
up to $500 or more for room, board,
travel, and miscellaneous costs.

The final decision on NSA will be
rendered in today’s referendum.

Faculty Eliminates Funds For ‘The

 

Faculty Upholds

‘No Girls” Rule

In Dormitories

——

STUDENT PLEA FAILS

President Cole To Initiate
Study Of Lounge Facilities
Available For Students

The faculty has rejected a

student plea that upperclass- |

men and law students be per-
mitted to have female guests
in their dormitory rooms dur-

ing specified hours.

The action taken at yesterday’s
faculty meeting was announced
Tuesday by Dean of Students Ed-
ward C. Atwood, Jr.

The student request reached the
faculty in the form of a resolution
approved by the executive commit-
tee.

Earlier, the University Student
Affairs Committee had split 6-6 on
a vote whether to recommend the
resolution to the faculty.

Lack of Facilities

Dean Atwood, who presented the
resolution before the faculty, said
the request was prompted primar-
ily by a lack of lounge facilities in
the university’s two upperclass dor-
mitories. He said that a majority
of students in these dormitories feel
that they are handicapped socially
by the situation.

Except for 330 freshmen who are
required to live in freshman dormi-
tories, and 80 upperclassmen and
law students living in the two up-
perclass dormitories, Washington and
Lee’s other 940 students reside either
in private accommodations or in the
universities eighteen fraternity hous-
es. Most of the students living in
the upperclass dormitories are not
affiliated with fraternities and do
not have a general access to lounge
and parlor facilities in the fraterni-
ty houses, Dean Atwood said.

Dean Atwood said he felt the
faculty turned down the student pe-
tition largely because it would in-
troduce more problems that it would
solve.

After faculty action, President
Cole said he would begin a study
to see what could be done to make
adequate lounge facilities available
to students living in the upperclass
dormitories.

Three Fourths of Student Body Votes

 

NSA Overwhelmed By Three to One

Washington and Lee membership! Third, I believe that a substantial

in the United States National Stu-
dent Association (NSA) was decis-
ively defeated in a student body
poll held Friday by a margin of
three to one. An affirmative vote fav-
ored a one-year trial membership,
as recommended by the ODK Coun-
cil. Affirmative votes totaled 204 to
707 “No” votes.

Law students voted almost unan-
imously against the trial member-
ship: out of 137 votes cast in Tucker
Hall, only 18 voted “Yes.”

Ballot boxes were located at Wash-
ington Hall, the Law School, and
the Commons, lasting from 8 a.m. to
5 p.m. EC members supervised the
voting.

Student Body President Fred Min-
del issued the following statement:

“Although I am able to understand
and respect this vote, 1 cannot help
but be disappointed by it. The rea-
son I proposed this membership in
the first place was because I felt it
would be an asset to our student
government and student life in gen-
eral: my view has not changed
There are three principle reasons for
my disappointment

“First the E.C. will be deprived
of valuable sources of information
as well as some possible inspiration,
Second, NSA concerns itself with a
dimension of student life which is

 

almost completely neglected at WéeL

 

 

number of voters were deluded by
some of the intentional distortions
handed out by the opposition.
“Even the opposition, however,
conceded that NSA had some very
attractive aspects. It is altogether
possible (if perhaps more difficult)
for W&L to make certain necessary
strides in these areas without help
of NSA, and right now this is my
foremost desire for our school. This
advancement, however, can only
come about through an “enlightened”

E.C. which is actively supported by
the student body.

“It would be extremely encourag-
ing to see the opposition to NSA,
in light of their recent concern with
the general welfare of W&L con-
tinue their efforts in the direction
of positive and progressive improve-
ments which everyone admits can
and should be made. If this can be
done we will all be satisfied, and
then it will cease to matter to some
of us whether or not we joined
NSA.”

House Finance

By JOHN CARRERE, JR.
After a long discusion on
the merits of having each fra-
ternity employ a Certified Pub-
loc Accountant, the IFC passed
a proposal by a 14-4 vote to
accept the CPA plan previous-

ly submitted by two local firms.
However, in order to validate the
amendment, it must again pass a
two-third’s majority at the next IFC
meeting.

The six-point program calls for
a study to be made of each fraterni-
ty by a CPA agency and a system of
auditing planned for each house. It
would include an annual audit and
also consultations, monthly or as
frequently as the CPA decided. Un-
the program a voucher system would
be instigated in which two persons
instead of one would be responsible
for a fraternity’s books. The cost of
the CPA service would run between
$200-$400 annually.

Dean Atwood and President Chuck
Griffin strongly supported the mea-
sure because they claim that there
was a great need for more accurate
bookkeeping. Dean Atwod stated
that it was not uncommon for one-
half of all the houses to have to
start over and rebalance a whole
year's figures.

The pink sheets now turned in
monthly to the dean's office can be
easily falsified and frequently are
in order to momentaritly balance the
house’s liabilities and assests. The
dean said that all this could be pre-
vented if there was someone check-
ing the books monthly, or at least
periodically. It was pointed out that
these periodic audits would not cost
much more than the one annual
audit obtained now by most fraterni-

Century-Old Magazine Arouses
Unanimous Opposition of Faculty

Washington and Lee University’s faculty has approved a
resolution that is expected to end publication of the nearly
century-old Southern Collegian as an official university stu-

The faculty voted unanimously Monday in favor of a reso-

lution “‘opposing continuation of the payment of funds from
- = ——————==<<<«—-— the comprehensive tuition fee to sup-

port the Southern Collegian.

Began In 1868

The magazine is published four
times during each school year. It
began publication in 1868 during the
administration of Robert E. Lee as
a student literary and general in-
terest magazine. In recent years its
emphasis has been directed toward
campus humor.

The faculty resolution is an out-
growth of the university’s current
two-year intensive self-study pro-
ject. The self-study committee, in
its evaluation of student publications,
recommended that the faculty with-
draw endorsement of the Southern
Collegian as a first step toward re-
moval of all University support for
the magazine.

Self-Study Citation

The self-study committee recom-
mendation cited the magazine’s poor
taste in content, the embarrassment
suffered by the university as a re-
sult, and the committee’s opinion
that the magazine serves no useful
educational purpose.

The Southern Collegian is edited
by a student staff under the direc-
tion of a student editor elected by
a faculty-student Publications Board.
Approximately half of its produc-
tions costs of $3,000 in 1964-65 was
derived from university fees paid
by all students.

Neither the University nor the
Publications Board exercises any
form of censorship over the maga-
zine, although distribution of sev-
eral issues in the past has been
halted by the University because of
objections to its content.

The faculty action Monday is ex-
pected to set in motion administra-
tive procedures that will reject any
future Publications Board budget re-
quests for funds for Southern Col-
legian use.

For The Wrong Reason

The controversy over Washington and Lee membership
in NSA, and the results of last Friday’s student body poll,
proves that while Senator McCarthy may be gone, he has not
been forgotten. Rarely have so many irrelevant and blandly
prejudicial side-issues been dragged into consideration of a
problem.

Those active patriots who opposed NSA managed to give
Liberalism versus Conservatism, “leftist’”’ infiltration, and “‘anti-
democratic” tendencies in NSA more attention than whether
or not the organization could benefit Washington and Lee.
It was an exercise in deliberate distortion and induced mass
hysteria, the like of which has no parallel save in the free-
wheeling tactics of the late unlamented Senator from Wiscon-
sin.

The opponents of NSA consciously misrepresented the
costs involved. Before the ODK Forum debate on the question,
the NSA representative discussed the financial obligations of
member schools in detail with one of the opposing students.
Yet still we were subjected to outlandish claims that NSA
membership would cost W&L “over $600” annually. The ac-
tual basic fee would have been $15.

NSA’s opponents succeeded in presenting a false picture
of the organization which made it appear little better than
a junior adjunct of the international Communist conspiracy.
The “red herring” which was so generously and attractively
served up by NSA’s opponents ranks as one of their meanest
maneuvers. They linked up NSA with everything except the
Abraham Lincoln Brigade.

They neatly managed to ignore the endorsements NSA
received from President Johnson, Kennedy, and Eisenhower,
and most governmental agencies and departments. They man-
aged to forget that NSA has led the fight for years against
Communist-dominated student organizations in the United
States and Europe. They even managed to forget the whole
purpose of the discussion on NSA. Like so many others of
their ilk, winning the debate was infinitely more important
than discovering truth. God, for them, fights on the side of
frothy glibness.

As President Fred Mindel frequently pointed out, a re-
sponsible case can be made against NSA. It has its negative
points which should have calmly and reasonably been discussed.
An intelligent and rational dialogue would have been the result
and the student body would have been the better for it, whether
NSA passed or not. But the negative half of the dialogue de-
generated into a destructive harangue, the goal of which was
neither concensus nor edification, Rather, its purpose was to
stampede the student body into voting against NSA, and they
were successful beyond their wildest expectations.

We view with disappointment the defeat of NSA, for it
would have been a worthwhile experiment. However, we look
with genuine sadness on the tactics and attitudes of those who
so energetically worked for NSA’s defeat. They have won their
little skirmish, but the University has paid too high a price
for their victory, We succumbed to a blatant appeal to mortal
fear. It is this defeat, and not so much that of NSA, which is
distressing.

Perhaps NSA is not for Washington and Lee. Perhaps it
is not a worthwhile organization and perhaps it is just as well we
did not join. Maybe it was too politically oriented. But does
the end once again justify the means; are we witnesses to
another noble deed accomplished “at all costs?” Perhaps the
seven hundred seven who voted No were right; but if
they are, they have done the right thing for the wrong reason.

Bogart Ultimately Responded
But Belmondo Remains Blase

 

By WARD BRIGGS

Last time I was talking about the
French love of the vulgarity of
American gangster and _ soldier-of-
fortune movies, and the misplaced
admiration for Humphrey Bogart,
amongst many of theCAMPus movie-
amongst many of the CAMPus
moviegoers.

Belmondo’s gangsters in Breath-
less is, unlike Bogart, blase. He’s
even blase about experiences he
hasn't had. If everything hasn’t hap-
pened to the character that Bel-
mondo portrays it doesn’t much mat-
ter. He steals a car, kills a cop,
makes it with Jean Seberg, and
steals another car—but he’s not sub-
stantially different after having done
so. The whole point about Bogart is
that these experiences had changed
him, usually before the opening of
the film.

The whole point about Belmondo
is that no experience will change
the character of Breathless. Under-
lying this view of the character is
the basic epistomological assumption
about man in the modern world:
experience as a means to knowledge
about ourselves or others is really
rather meaningless. Either that or
the nerve ends of our sensibilities
have become capped—so much that
we cannot be touched by what we
feel.

With Bogart, on the other hand,

 

there existed the possibility of
knowledge, some sort of dramatic
response to it, and, by inference,
a redemption of sorts. Bogart would
help the fleeing freedom fighter. He
didn’t believe in anything or any-
one, to be sure, but he didn’t believe
in Paul Henreid the underground
worker more than he didn’t believe
in his Fascist enemies.

The point is , that Bogart ultimate-
ly responded. He had gone to Casa-
blanca or the Florida Keys or some
Jamacian port to absent himself from
the major battlefields of human con-
flict, but even in these places that
were out of the way, that were very
definitely not where it was at, he
couldn't help responding, being
drawn back into the mainstream of
human life and conflict. He always
found he recognized and appreciated
human feelings which he himself no
longer had. That was the whole dra-
matic movement of his character—
being brought to the realization that
some spark of human feeling, of re-
sponse and responsibility to his fel-
low man could yet be struck within
him. And when it was, he would be
forced back to “where it's at.”

The Boredom of the Moment
But with Belmondo this nostalga
for dead or trampled human felings

is itself lost.
He recognizes nothing but the

 

moment. Betwen grief and nothing,
Belmondo says in Breathless, he’ll
take nothing. Nothing but the mo-
ment and this with utter boredom.
He doesn’t have to be drawn back
to human feling or to anything that’s
“where it’s at.” He’s the center of
his universe. Nothing matters be-
yond him—no clash of alien ideol-
ogies, no human sufferings beyond
or within his ken; only the moment.
And because nothing beyond him
matters much, he doesn’t matter
much either—to himself or his au-
dience.

This to me is where Belmondo is
at in Breathless, and it’s what he
projects well as an actor; a man
who embodies a paradox. A man of
vitality and inervation. One who is
going everywhere and nowhere, and
doesn’t much care. (He’s chased in
Breathless and pursues and is pur-
sued everywhere in That Man from
Rio.) He is possessed of great energy
on the outside and ennui at the core,
of beautiful, would and even zany
movement—but with an empty eye
at the center of the hurricane, Un-
like Bogart, the flame of human
warmth has not been extinguished—
it has simply never ben lit and never
can be.

Interestingly, I think the audience
views Belmondo with paradoxical

Ideas on Preservation of Traditions:
Standards, Values and Enforcement

By DR. JOHN M. GUNN
Assistant Profssor of Economics

It has been argued recently in this
paper that the critical issue in the
matter of Conven-
tional Dress is not
whether the tradi-
toin will be pre-
served but what
the future role of
the Assimilation
Committee should
be.

I believe this
argument mistakes
the facts of the
matter.

The critical issue
at the moment is, precisely, whether
Conventional Dress will continue to
be a standard at Washington and
Lee, not only in the future, but in
the closing weeks of the present se-
mester.

The role of the Assimilation Com-
mittee (or more generally, the role
of organized procedures to main-
tain traditional standards) also is
important. Before turning to that
matter, however, consider first two
other questions, and a comment on
the speaking tradition.

Whose Standards?

Gentlemanly Behavior, the Friend-
ly Greeting, and Conventional Dress
often are called “student traditions.”
This term understates their role.
They are University traditions.
Students, Faculty, Administrative
Officers, and Alumni—all have valid
interest in these traditions and in
their potential contribution to the
University’s total effort.

In the past, students usually have
assumed primary responsibility for
such limited measures as were need-
ed for conserving these traditions.
In a college where so much authority
has been delegated to a student
government, and where student self-
government is regarded as a valuable
part of the overall educational ex-
perience, it is especially fitting that
this role should have been so.

It surely would not be improper,
in the present circumstances, for
members of the Faculty and Admin-
istration to take part in efforts to
preserve that which is threatened.
On the other hand, a too-vigorous
effort from the Faculty would be
likely to have an opposite effect
from the desired one,

Whose Protest?

If a man genuinely believed that
the standards which I believe aug-
ment the central mission of the
University, in fact, detracted from
that mission, I would support his
rejection of those standards. If a
man felt his personal freedom in-
fringed seriously by the communi-
ty’s desire that he wear a necktie,
neat against a buttoned collar, I
might think his freedom rather
fragile, but I would respect his po-
sition

On the other hand, a protest for
protest's sake is as useless as tradi-
tion for tradition’s sake, and more

 

 

 

likely to be injurious—not only in-

jurious to the community but in-
jurious to the protestor, himself,
who is distracted from HIS own
true objectives. How much of the
current cries for “freedom” or for
“proper goals” mask sophomoric pro-
test for protest’s sake? And how
much of them reflect sheer lethargy?

On Exchange of Greetings

Perhaps it would facilitate the
friendly greeting if the practice were
recognized that when two persons,
not close friends, approach each
other, the junior person speaks first.
Freshmen speak to upperclassmen;
students speak to members of the
faculty, etc. This is but a convenient
rule-of-thumb. It would have been
assumed by all, in an earlier age.

Regardless of who speaks first, not
to return a greeting is more than
neglect of tradition. It is a flagrant
act of rudneness. (Perhaps we need a
tradition that if a men declines point-
edly to return one’s greeting, the
greeter has leave to trip him, with-
out liability.) It takes less effort to
return a greeting than to turn one’s
head in a deliberate effort to avoid
returning it.

Organization and Tradition

Because of the quadrennial turn-
over of student membership in a col-
lege community, collegiate traditions
are less able to be self-sustaining
than traditions of a more stable com-
munity. Therefore, they may re-
quire some organized effort if they
are to be conserved. That is to say,
something like an Assimilation
Committee has a role to play. Never-
theless, collegiate traditions are
in a healthy state when organized
procedures to maintain them are
minimal.

It will be helpful in considering
the appropriate role of the Assimila-
tion Committee as conservator of
beneficial traditions to ask two sep-
arate questions: What should its role
be in “ordinary circumstances”?
What should its role be in the cur-
rent crisis in dress?

In “ordinary circumstances” I
would view the primary function
of the Assimilation Committee as an
educational one. It should seek to
achieve conformity with tradition—
not to impose it. It should assist
new students in appreciating the
individual and mutual benefits to be
derived rfom maintaining the com-
munity's established standards. Pri-
mary “enforcement” of these stand-
ards should come—CAN § and
ONLY—from the attitudes of the
mass of the Student Body, not from
the procedures of student govern-
ment

The Assimilation Committee could
make effective use of power to call
before it individuals who neglect
community standards, to discuss
with them the relationships between
individual freedem and community
responsibility. In some cases, men
will persist in ignoring the stand-
ards of the community, and the
community must determine how far
it le willing to coerce the individual
to enhance the common welfare.

 

My choice would be that if an oc-
casional man neglects the conven-
tions of community behavior, let
him. On the other hand, when the
occasional man finds a friend, and
they find a few more, the erosion
of community customs can accelerate
rapidly, especially if a few are seek-
ing deliberately to destroy those
customs. The community then faces
an unpleasant dilemma: coerce the
individuals or watch the communi-
ty’s significant traditions evaporate.

If the community faces a dilemma,
however, the dissenting individual
also faces a dilemma, unless he be
devoid of any sense of community
responsibility. He must decide
whether his freedom of style in dress
and his freedom not to speak a
greeting to his fellow scholars is
worth so much to him that he is
willing to aid in the destruction of
something his fellow members of the
University regard as beneficial to
their development and esthetically
pleasing. His dilemma is the more
awkward for the realization that he
joined the Washington and Lee com-
munity quite freely, knowing what
its established standards of behavior
and dress are and have been.

The Present Crisis

Even more than in “ordinary” cir-
cumstances ,the survival of Conven-
tional Dress at Washington and Lee
at present depends upon its enforce-
ment by the expressed attitudes of
the mass of the Student Body, who

Assimilation Viewed as Arbitrary

Since Some Seen

By NICK RUFFIN

Last Thursday a small number of
students undertook a mass assimila-
tion of the student body at Wash-
ington and Lee, All students not
wearing conventional dress as de-
fined by the Assimilation Commit-
tee were assimilated.

The theory of the Assimilation
Committee is that it is to penalize
the students not wearing convention-
dress. The responsibility for polic-
ing the students theoretically rests
with the students themselves. Sup-
posedly, a student will assimilate
another student regardless of the
violator's fraternity or campus im-
age. In performing a mass assimila-
tion, the small number of students
assumed the task in which the rest
of the students have been deliquent.

The purpose of the mass assimila-
tion was to demonstrate the absurd-
ity of the idea of an Assimilation
Committee and enforced convention-
al dress. Over 100 students were as-
similated in one morning demon-
strating the weakness of the present
assimilation system.

Many students who observed the
mass assimilation were infuriated.
They thought that the Assimilation
Committee no longer functioned or
that they had some privilege status
which was being challenged. The

Untouchable’

case of Mickey Isikoff proves that
the Assimilation procedure _ still
functions in a very arbitrary man-
ner, Mr. Isikoff was the victim of a
“joke” in which a small number of
students employed the assimilation
apparatus to persecute a fellow stu-
dent. These students may not have
forseen the severity of the ultimate
penalty; but they did not come forth
to testify in Mr, Isikoff’s behalf, so
I assume they were not terribly
disturbed by his Social Probation.
The Untouchables

At the present time there are
thirty or forty students who are less
“eonventional” in their dress than
was Mr. Isikoff. But these students
are apparently “untouchable.” For
some reason the assimilation pro-
eedure does not touch them. All
students at W&L are equal under the
rules, but some are more equal than
others.

As long as students think the As-
similation Committee does not affect
them, they are unlikely to vote to
abolish the enforcement of con-
ventional dress. But the mass assimi-
lation reached the untouchables. The
asimilations will continue until all

realize they are subject to Social
Probation
Most students were not outraged

One word can express Coach Nor-

year’s swimming team—“succesful.”
Indeed the Generals’ tankmen were
a success as they swam their way
to an 8-3 record and a second place
in the CAC tournament. Led by next
year’s co-captains, Bill Wildrick and
Bart Taylor, the Generals broke
every record except two.

Bill Wildrick led the record break- |

Coach Eastman’s Job Security for the Ne

ers as he set two W&L pool records:
the 200 yd. freestyle and the 200 yd.
butterfly; was a part of two others—-
the medley relay and the 400 yd.
freestyle relay; and was involved
in five W&lL records for regulation
pools—100 yd. butterfly, 200 yd. but-
terfly, 200 yd. freestyle, and both
medley and freestyle relays.

Bart Taylor set the W&L pool rec-
ord for the 100 yd. freestyle and was
anchor man of both the medley and
freestyle relays which set pool rec-
ords. Bart is also co-holder of the
W&L record for regulation pools in
the 100 yd. freestyle and was anchor
man of the record breaking medley
relay team

Freshman Billy Ball closed out a
tremendous season with four firsts
in the CAC tournament, 3 of which
were records. Billy holds two W&L
pool records—the 200 yd. indicidual
and the 200 yd. backstroke; four
regulation pool records—the 100 and
200 yd. backstroke, the 200 and 400
individual medleys; and swam back-
stroke in the record breaking med-
ley relay.

Anthony Announces Trivia
Deadline, Staff Members

By CLARK KENT
Mild-Mannered Reporter

Michael Anthony, Secretary to the
producers, has announced that with
only two days remaining before the
deadline, 13 fraternities have yet to
enter teams in the Ring-tum Phi-
Radio W&L Trivia Contest. No en-
tries will be accepted after March
10.

“Aside from this disappointing
number of entries,’ Anthony said,
“we are making excellent progress
with our plans for the program. A
great many outstandingly esoteric
questions have been provided for
us by well-wishers. I think we can
promise a really fine lineup.”

Personnel for the broadcast, which
will be held March 17, have mostly
been selected. M.C. for the program
will be Radio Personality Tom
White, while Dr. Keith Shillington
(by special permission of the Troub-
adour Theater) will serve as score-
keeper. Mr. J. K. Jennings of the
journalism school is technical as-
sistant to the producers.

“One of our chief problems,” says
Anthony, “is guaranteeing the in-
tegrity of the questions to be used
in the final competition. We are
presently negotiating with the local
banks for the loan of an armored
car to transport the material to the
studio.”

Entries should be mailed to Radio
Personality White at Box 457.

Notice

A musician who conducts on a
tape recorder, Vladimir Ussachevsky,
will appear tonight at 8 p.m. in
Room 201 of the New Science
Building. He will lecture and give a
concert entitled “An Introduction
to Electronic Music” tomorrow night
in Lee Chapel.

Ussachevsky is a 54-year-old com-
poser and Columbia University pro-
fesor who began his electronic mus-
ic experiments with a tape recorder
in 1951. The phrase “push-button
music” annoys Ussachevsky as much
as the term “space music.” “If the
composer is skillful, it will show
through. His music will be better
than someone who just doodles with
sound.”

Ussachevsky’s appearance here is
sponsored by the Concert Guild.

 

 

Future Bright
For Riflemen

Sergeant Kenneth Taylor is op-
timistically looking forward to next
year’s rifle season. There are many
reasons for the coach’s high hopes.

Only one senior, Harold Head,
will be lost through graduation in
June. “With losing only one boy I
feel confident that we will have a
strong ten man-plus varsity next
year,” commented Coach Taylor.

The improvement shown by fresh-
men during the season indicates
the hopes for next year.

Sgt. Taylor said, “the freshmen
contributed greatly to the program
this year and their improvement
was marked. Their scores jumped
from below 1300 early in the year to
a high of 1371 at the end of the sea-
son.”

The shooters made a fine late sea-
son showing in the State Champion-
ship meet at Fort Lee. The team
finished in a fifth place tie with
Hampden-Sydney and W&M. Ahead
of the Generals were VMI, VPI
(both military schools), Richmond,
and UVa.

 

The Generals made their best
showing in the last meet of the
season. It was the National Rifle
Association Sectional meet, at Fort
Lee, on February 26.

W&L finished a deceptive seventh.
The only teams to score higher were
three teams from VMI, two from
VPI, and UVa. The Generals finished
ahead of Richmond and W&M, both
of whom had defeated W&L earlier
in the year.

In the Sectional, Robert Lackey
shot a 280 (out of a possible 300).
This was the highest single per-
formance of the year the varsity.

“IT think it is important to note,”
continued Sgt. Taylor, “that we
finished just 42 points behind the
winning team from VMI.”

The Sectional team was composed
of Head, sophomore Lackey, and
freshmen Ron Kessler and Crawford
Williams.

Shillington Moves to Sports

The versatile Dr. J. K. (the Gard-
ener) Shillington, fresh from recent
triumphs at the Troubadour Theatre
and in orange tree growing, will
reign again in Doremus Gymnasium
Thursday night.

Campus sports strategists were in
unison in support of the naming of
Dr. Shillington as chief master mind
(coach) in the faculty’s attempt to
subvert the students on the basket-
ball court.

Past faculty wins can be credited
almost entirely to the chemistry pro-
fessor’s quick mind and heady eval-
uation of the strategic situation.
When victory is at stake he knows
what action to take and cooly takes
it. This usually means intimidating
the referee.

The student team remains shroud-
ed in secrecy. There seems to be
some difficulty in rounding up vol-
unteers to face Shillington’s vengeful
band. Coach Tim Henry said that
four fraternities have yet to find
willing representatives.

Team members named thus far are
Tom Bruton of the Betas, Chuck
Boggs of DU, Randy Poore of Kappa
Sig, Buck Woodford for the Lamb
Choppers, Gil Turner of the Fijis,
Gerry Taylor of the IU, Charlie
Freret of the Phi Psis, Joe Framp-
tom of the PiKAs, and Phi Kap
Wick Vellines.

The Pi Phis will be represented by
Dave Schwendeman, Dick Bradford
will play for SAE, Jim Woody for
the Chis, Buck Clement for the
SNus, and Ron Laupheimer for ZBT.

 

“Doc” Shillington

Henry declined to make any pre-
diction as to the outcome of the
game. Dr. Shillington, on the other
hand, when asked how badly he ex-
pected to beat the student entry,
commented, “If we can get to the
referees, quite badly. We hope to
deal with the referees in an adult
manner.”

Proceeds will go to the athletic
fund to be used for such things
as scouting—especially scouting Se-
wanee.

Two new appointments were an-
nounced at the beginning of the
meeting. F. L. Wilson was appoint-
ed chairman of the House Man-
agers’ Committee. Tom Baremore
was announced as chairman of the
Parents’ Weekend Committee.

The chairmanship of Contact was
also announced to now include two
posts. The responsibility would be
divided between a business manager
and an operations manager. Taking
this into consideration, applicants
for chairman were instructed to re-
submit their applications next Mon-
day.

A number of suggested changes,
already passed by the Faculty Com-
mittee, also were accepted by the
IFC with an 18-0 vote. These must
also receive a two-third’s majority
at the next meeting. Significant is
the change of the stipulation of limit-
ing combos to four football week-
ends and three off weekends. The
alteration would allow a fraternity
to have their seven “combo” week-
ends whenever they wanted. An un-
limited number of “chip-in” parties
are also now allowed. A “chip-in”
party was defined as one in which
the people of the house are given
an option whether to contribute to
its cost or not.

The reaction to the mass assimila-

wearing them, “gentlemen.”

Collegian Decision Is Called “Secretive”

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Last Monday’s faculty recommen-
dation that University funds be
withdrawn from the Southern Col-
legian has raised strong objections
from several student groups, notably
the Executive Committee and the
Publications Board. Under the pres-
ent constitutional arrangements,
faculty recommendation is  tanta-
mount to legislative, and it is almost
certain that the administration will
agree to curtail Southern Collegian
funds for next year.

The faculty decision was made as
a result of the Self-study Commit-
tee’s report on the Southern Col-
legian which asserted that the cen-
tury-old magazine is in poor taste
serves no useful educational pur-
pose, and is an embarrassment to the
University. About half of the Col-

FRIDAY
Edition

 

legian’s $3,000 publication costs cur-
rently come from University activity
funds.

The student Executive Committee
and the Publications Board have both
drawn up resolutions to President
Cole to delay final decisions until
student opinion can be expressed.
Their objections to the faculty de-
cision are based on the dubious
manner of the proceeding against
the Collegian: It has been revealed
that:

(1) Last fall, Dean Edward Atwood
and Mr. Frank Parsons privately
requested that the Wé&L print shop
refuse to print the Collegian, Later,
when Collegian editor Jim Crothers
went to the print shop to make ar-
rangements concerning the publica-
tion, he was informed, much to his
surprise, that the W&L shop would

 

not print the magazine. Crothers
was consequently forced to print the
Collegian in Staunton.

(2) For registration, the old
“Student Activities Fee’ has been
lumped into an overall tuition fee.
This has had the effect of transfer-
ring financial responsibility for stu-
dent activities from the students to
the administration.

(3) The Self-study Committee
made no mention of the Southern
Collegian in its report earlier in the
year. When students asked to dis-
cuss the Collegian with the commit-
tee, they were told that the com-
mittee was not prepared to discuss
the magazine.

(4) No members of the Publica-
tions Board or any other students
were invited to participate in the

Self-study Committee, nor was any
student group asked to present a
defense of the Collegian.

(5) On February 10, the Publica-
tions Board voted to hold a faculty-
student discussion on the Southern
Collegian, but the faculty’s decision
on Monday effectively cut out such
discussion.

(6) The Publications Board was in
the process of taking a poll to be
presented to the Self-study Com-
mittee on Tuesday, but the poll was
undercut by the Monday vote of the
faculty. The poll revealed that 99
percent of the student body reads
the Southern Collegian, that 94 per-
cent approves of it, and that 78 per-
cent of the students’ parents ap-
prove of the magazine.

In an interview, Publications Board
President Drew Baur stated that

 

 

the actions taken by the administra-
tion and faculty were unknown to
the students until the faculty vote
on Monday was already an accom-
plished fact. Baur pointed out that
the Southern Collegian is part of the
student constitution, and that its
probable elimination by the above
methods means that similar alter-
ation of any part of the constitution
is a possibility. Baur particularly ob-
jected to the refusal of the Self-
study Committee to discuss the Col-
legian with students and to the
secretive nature of the administra-
tion and faculty proceedings, es-
pecially when the Publications Board
“fully intended to meet the South-
ern Collegian issue this year.”

The faculty decision came as a
complete surprise to the Publica-
tions Board, which had actually met

Che KRing-tum Phi

Washington and Lee Semi-Weekly Newspaper

on Tuesday with announced inten-
tion of discussing the Collegian on
that day. The surprise announce-
ment caused great indignation among
student board members, and hot
words ensued between student mem-
bers and the Dean of Students.

The spring edition of the Southern
Collegian, printed in Staunton, will
be the last issue financed by W&L
activities funds, and possibly the
last ever. The faculty decision does
not go into effect until next year.

There is some possibility that the
Southern Collegian can continue
publication next year through sub-
scription. Furthermore, the Collegian
editor and business manager may
still sit on the Publications Board,
even though their magazine will no
longer be an official W&L publica-
tion.

Students Ask
Step-up In

I ntegration

Monday night, March 7, in the
lounge of the Student Union, ap-
proximately twenty-five students in-
terested in the welfare of Washing-
ton and Lee were called together by
Fred Mindel, President of the Stu-
dent Government. The purpose of
this meeting was to discuss ways by
which the students could aid the
administration and admisisons com-
mittee in hastening the integration
of the university.

The members of this group felt
that in order for Washington and

Lee to remain a leader in the field
of education, it is necessary to accept
qualified Negroes into the student
body as soon as possible. They also
added that the educational process
of the school is badly restricted
without the presence of Negroes at
an institution of such high caliber
and esteem. Thus the group pro-
posed three plans which would aid
the administration in attaining this
goal.

1. Sponsor a fund drive among
the students, faculty and possibly
outside sources. The proceeds from
this drive could be used to estab-
lish a Negro scholarship fund or
could be given to the admissions
department to help further the
recruitment of Negroes.

2. Look into the possibility of
having a Negro in some of our ex-
change programs. It was cited that
other Southern universities have
found this an effective means of
futhering their own integration

Students aid the admissions com-
mittee in interviewing qualified
Negroes, familiarizing them with
WA&L and encouraging them to ap-
ply here.

James Farrar, Dean of Admissions,
told Mindel that a responsible pro-
gram initiated by the students with
regard to the fund drive and inter-
views would be, he felt certain, not

Ah, March. The month when a young man’s fancy turns, apparently,

to thoughts of what's wrong with W&L. Last year it was the Charlie
Milne case. This year, according to the group with the placard at the right,
it’s the injustice of a penalty for violating conventional dress, The rest
of the student body will make its opinions known in a referendum Mon-
day. Funny thing, though: everybody in this picture seems to be in coat

Executive Committee set final plans
for the Assimilation Committee Poll,
discussed the faculty withdrawal of
funds for the Southern Collegian,
heard a request from junior Jim
Awad for an Independent Study Pro-
gram, settled the Mickey Isikoff case,
and voted down N.S.A.

The Assimilation Committee poll
will be held on Monday, March 14,
with polling boxes located in front
of and behind Washington Hall, in
the Law School, and in the Com-
mons. The student body is to be
offered three choices in the poll:
(1) Retain the Assimilation Com-
mittee as it is now, (2) Re-establish
the fining power of the Assimila-
tion Committee, and (3) abolish the
Assimilation Committee.

The official status of the vote is
to be that of an opinion poll, and
the Executive Committee will make
the final decision regarding the fu-
ture status of the Assimilation Com-
mittee. Nevertheless, the EC will
probably follow the wishes of the
student body, as expressed in the
poll.

activities funds from the Southern
Collegian, most of the EC members
expressed indignation. President
Fred Mindel concluded that “essen-
tially, the faculty has altered our
constitution without consulting us.”

A resolution on the faculty action
was drawn up and passed with only
one absentation. The resolution ex-
pressed the belief of the Executive
Committee that in making their de-
cision, the faculty ignored student
opinion and wishes and repeatedly
ignored student attempts to bring
the Southern Collegian up for stu-
dent-faculty discussion. The resolu-
tion, addressed to President Cole,
asked that the issue be resubmitted
to the Self-study Committee so that
students could express their views.

Independent Study Plan

The EC listened to a request from
Jim Awad that an Independent
Study Plan be adopted for W&L.
Under Awad’s plan, (1) first semes-

President Mindel announced that

They ll Walk All Over You

You keep playing where you shouldn’t be playing; and
you think that you'll never get burned, ha! I Just
found a brand new box of matches, yeah. And what we
know you ain’t had time to learn. These boots are
made for walking and that’s just what they'll do; one
of these days these boots will walk all over you. Are
you ready boots, start walking ....

 

The lyrics to Nancy Sinatra’s “Boots” probably best ex-
press the way Washington and Lee’s Administration handled
the banning of the Southern Collegian. Cloaked under the
pretense of a self-study recommendation, Washington Hall has
seemingly finally found a way to remove Washington and Lee’s
name and the students’ money from the 100-year-old humor
magazine,

When the true facts of the case become known we feel
sure Monday’s action to remove University support from the
Collegian will be termed by students and faculty alike as noth-
ing but reprehensible, ungentlemanly, and generally disgust-
ing.

Aside from telling only one side of the story, the admin-
istration successfully managed to distort even those facts
it made known. The act will do more to harm student-faculty
relations than years of constructive activity can ever accom-
plish simply because student opinion was walked over.

The Publications Board which is responsible for the Col-
legian designated the March meeting (which was to be held
less than 24 hours after the faculty’s decision was reached) to
review the Collegian’s future with members of the self-study
committee. The purpose of the PB meeting had been public
knowledge since February 10.

In the self-study’s open meeting on Student Life, which
included a section on publications, two members of the PB
were present and specifically asked about the Collegian’s future.
They were told at that time that the issue was not yet ready
to be discussed.

It seems quite apparent to us that the University knew
what it was doing when it choose to place no students on the
sub-committee for publications, while students did serve on
each of the other committes dealing with student life.

Earlier this year the administration had attempted to
sabotage the Collegian by “asking”? Mr. Harold Lauck, W &L’s
print shop supervisor, to stop printing the book. When the
magazine found a printer elsewhere and was actually doing
better financially than in years past, it became obvious to
University officials that a more blatant display of power was
needed.

The ramifications of this action by the administration are
vast. Fundamentally, the administration did not give students
a voice in an area where self-government is supposed to pre-
vail. They not only did not give students a voice but they ef-
fectively cut-off all student attempts to expres stheir views on
the issue.

Do we live under the pretense of a student government,
while in actuality we are living under the influence of a pater-
nal hand which clinches to satisfy its own particular whims,
squeezing from the student body that which is rightfully its
own?

We strongly urge that President Cole throughly investigate
and throughtfully consider the faculty’s action and the circum-
stances which lead to the banning of the Southern Collegian.

Integration at WGEL

We feel that Monday night’s student action to raise funds
to bring a qualified Negro to Washington and Lee is laudable,
but we do question some of the reasoning behind the group's
action.

First, we can see no direct correlation between Washington
and Lee admitting a Negro and the improved academic climate
they suggest this would create. Nor can we see how admitting a
Negro enters at all into a university's greatness or its medioc-

 

rity.

Secondly, raising funds to give a worthy student scholar.
ship aid is certainly laudable. But why must this student be
only a Negro? It seems more logical to us to raise funds for
qualified students regardles of race.

Thirdly, W&L removed itself from any type of student
subsidization program when it dropped subsidized athletics in
1954. Giving aid to a Negro, simply because he is a Negro,
seems to us to be nothing more than subsidizing the race.
Finally, if a Negro were to come to Washington and Lee, we
would like to feel that he will be entering school for the same
wants to and

reason our other students enter because he

not because he is being paid to do so.

Ruffin Finds Balance of Multiversity
And Isolation Necessary For Success

By NICK RUFFIN

To speak meaningfully of Wash-
ington and Lee, one must attempt to
place it in some
perspective in the
society. Washing-
ton and Lee is a
good college. By
good, I mean that
if one were to list
all the colleges in
the United States
and, then, were to
attempt to rate the
colleges, Washing-
ton and Lee would
stand above many
others. Some would be tempted to
go further in the rating, but I find
this rating business to be almost
meaningless for a general apprasial.
About all that one can say is that
a college is good, fair or poor. So
what am I saying? I am saying that
Washington and Lee is good because
at some time in the past, Washing-
ton and Lee achieved a certain ex-
cellence, and this excellence is with
us, in some form today.

Washington and Lee is a small,
private, liberal arts college, physical-
ly isolated from the centers of de-
cision and action in the society.
Washington and Lee has always been
essentially in an ivory tower (re-
gardless of what you think of Lex-
ington). Washington and Lee is free
to observe the society from a dis-
tance. We are not subject to the
whims and fads that sweep the
Metropolis. We are unlikely to fall
victim to temporary folly. We have
the perpective and judgment of dist-
ance from the society, and this dist-
ance is one of our greatest assets.
But there is danger in withdrawing
to the ivory tower. As one gains
perspective on the society, he losses
perspective on himself. Washington
and Lee is not subject to the critical
commentary and tests that society
provides.

   

Ruffin

The ivory tower is intoxicating;
the wisdom gained about others
blinds one to the knowledge of him-
self. The balance in the ivory tower
is difficult to maintain. Washington
and Lee has lost that balance. Unless
the balance is regained Washington
and Lee will lose its race.

Washington and Lee must be able
to justify its existence in the face
of increased competition. The ulti-

Elusive Excellence
The nature of this excellence is
elusive. Washington and Lee has an
able student body, Washington and
Lee has a good faculty, and Wash-

 

mate question is, is Washington and
Lee worth the cost? The society has
limited resources, and it seeks to
obtain the maximum education from
them. The small college is obviously
the most inefficient form of institu-
tion. The multiversity can educate
(I use this word in its broadest
sense) more people more efficiently
than can the small college. The
multiversity can also afford to pro-
vide greater physical facilities, es-
pecially in the sciences, than can the
small college.

Finally, the multiversity can offer
the stimulation of graduate depart-
ments, their libraries and their fac-
ulties, which the small college cannot
offer. The multiversity is more ef-
ficient, and it is usually public or
the recipient of public grants and
aid. The multiversity has access to
great wealth, and as it appears more
efficient, logically should receive this
wealth.

What is left for the small college?
The small college has a future, a
necessary and important one. The
standard argument against the mul-
tiversity is that it makes the student
a number, that the classes are too
large for significant learning, and
that the multiversity overwhelms
the student. I have friends at a few

 

large universities; they say the com-
plaints are exaggerated. They don’t
feel lost or like IBM cards; in their
upper level courses they have fif-
teen to twenty in a class. They like
having James Baldwin, John Ken-
neth Galbraith, Saul Bellow and U.S.
Senators on their campuses as a
matter of course. I think the prob-
lem of large classes will be over-
come soon, as will many other faults
of the large universities. The small
college must offer more than small
classes, and intimacy.

What can the small college offer?
The small college can offer a unity
impossible to imagine in larger col-
leges, a unity of academic program
with a variety of student experience.
No doubt personal contact is easier
between professor and student out-
side the class at a small college. More
important is the idea of interde-
partmental communication between
professors and between students.
This education in many disciplines
is fundamental in a liberal arts edu-
cation, By offering an integrated pro-
gram in the liberal arts transcend-
ing departmental lines, the small col-
lege can produce something close to
the whole man, something the mul-
tiversity many not do.
(Continued next week)

 

ington and Lee has many features,
both good and bad, which make it
Washington and Lee. But high col-
lege boards and a flock of Ph.D.’s
don’t guarantee very much. It is
the quality of students and faculty
in reaction to and with the character

of the institution which make it a
good college.
But I have more to say about

Washington and Lee, for Washing-
ton and Lee’s excellence under
strain; Washington and Lee is ex-
cellent, but only in spite of itself.
Washington and Lee is now con-
sciously or unconsciously in search
of itself. (The self-study will not
find Washington and Lee.)

Following the Soviet launching in
1957, the educational system, which
previously developed without much

Editor Sees W-WGL Plot

By CHARLIE BATSINGER
Dear Mom and Dad,

The scene, a meeting of the fa-
mous Hill. The problem, the North-
eastern Student,
truly the only
sporting publica-
tion of Walla-
Walla and Leaven-
worth University.

The characters:

Osgood Conklin,
Dean; James
Bombed, adviser

in charge of sec-
recy and spying;
Masura (“Me-
too”) I-to, advis-
er in charge of sneak attacks; New-
ton Minnows, adviser in charge of
censuring and measuring values.
Dean Conklin: I just don’t know
what we are going to do about the

 

Bensinger

Student, the students just enjoy
it too much for our, oops, their own
good.

Bombed: I’ve been running some
surveys, in secret of course, and it
seems that 87.6969 per cent of “our
boys” and 99.9969 per cent of their
dates all wait in drooling expecta-
tions of the next issue. It’s tradi-
tional.

Conklin: To hell with tradition.
How many times do I have to tell
you, never pay any attention to tra-
dition unles it suits your purpose.
If our degenerate “boys” and their
pseudo dates enjoy the rag, then
it must be bad. But what are we
going to do about it?

 

Trivia Contestants Badly Shaken

I-to: Let’s load up the aircraft
carriers and pull a sneak attack!

Conklin: And how many times
have I told you that our navy can’t
get this far up the Jerkwater. The
cadets at Axe Military Academy, in
their atempts to emulate The Point,
have stretched a huge chain across
the river below us.

I-to: Well, I still favor a sneak
attack.

Conklin: I agree with you, but
how?

Minnows: Well, the Student is
amoral and befitting of Berkeley,
not W-W&L. It must be stopped. I
happen to have some experience in
the field of communieations, and
haven’t I done wonders in stopping
student-faculty relations and com-
munications? I would advise using
the self-study format to erase this
blot on our record.

Conklin: That is what I call a
great idea. There is a real thinker.
Go on.

Minnows: We could set up publi-
cations as one of the fields of study,
and then prevent the students from
having anything to do with that
area. We can set up the committee
without students on it, even if it
will be the only one. Everytime that
we are asked anything about it, we
can say that the report is not yet
ready. We can have closed meetings,
and...

Bombed: In secret!

Minnows: Of course. And then for
the crowning blow, just before the

By Entry Of Parsons And Davis

By CLARK KENT
Mild-Mannered Reporter

A flood of new entries for the
Ring-tum Phi-Radio W&L Trivia
Contest has seriously upset the cal-
culations of Las Vegas bookmakers
attempting to establish a betting line
on the event
Most significant of these is a facul-
entry, consisting of information
director Frank Parsons and journal-
Paxton Davis, which
is described by handicapper Gil
Thorp as “a match for all but the
most trivial students.”

Other teams which enetred before
yesterday's deadline were “Ozark
Oak” Seibert and Phil “Ping-pong”
Runyon for Sigma Chi; Denny Nied-
ringhaus and “Fast” Eddie Allen for
Sigma Nu: and Steve “Blind Duck”
Millard and Rich “Babyface” John-
son Pi Phi. These additions
brought the total number of entries
to 11 for the preliminary quiz Mon-
day night

Despite this rush of new entries,
Throp still considers the ZBT team

of Paul “Slinger” Schlesinger and
Charlie “Author” Bensinger to be
the team to beat. “They are well-

balanced—strong in all fields,” Thorp

says. “Schlesinger is probably

Commenting on the sophomore-
and-freshman Sigma Chi roster, Tho
said “I really think very few rookies
can make it big in this league. It

and give him a really trivial mind,
except in a few special cases. These

There is one other all-freshman
entry, the PEP team of Bob Moselle
and Bern Bonifant, while the Phi
Gam team contains rookie Bob

Other team competing in the
preliminary contest include Randy

“The Mad Ukran-

ian” Mickle and Bernard “Rip Van
Winkle” Person for the NFU; and
Steve “White Whale” Saunders and
Tom “Rented Bathtub” Doss for SPE.
These teams will take a prelimi-
nary quiz of 50 questions on Mon-
day, March 14. The four teams which
score highest on this test will be
allowed to participate in the final
competition, which will be held in
the Reid Hall studio from 9 to 9:30
p.m. on Tuesday, March 17.
Questions for the preliminary con-
test have already been drawn up,
and include esoteric and _ totally
worthless bits of information from
the fields of rock and roll, television,
old movies, old radio, children’s
books, sports, comic books and com-
ie strips. “Some of them are fairly
easy,” according to Michael Anthony,
“and some of them—I'll drop dead if
anybody gets a couple of these.”

Bensinger Picks Kentucky
To Take NCAA Crown—
Guess Where He’s From?

With the aid and assistance of
Sports Hlustrated, the Friday Ring-
tum Phi has come up with its selec-
tions for the NCAA tournament.

In the East (Raleigh), it will be
Duke over St. Joe, a toss-up between
Syracuse and Davidson (though we
would pick Syracuse if pushed), and
Duke to defeat the winner for the
regional crown

In the Mid-East (lowa City), one
will see Kentucky defeat the world
Kentucky over Dayton, Western
Kentucky over Michigan (how about
that?), and then the Cats to down
the Hilltoppers

In the Mid-West (Lubbock), Kan-
sas will win over S.M.U., and then
over Cincy, the winner of the Cin-
cinnati-Texas Western game. If Tex-
as Western should happen to win,
Kansas will still wind up on top

In the West (Les Angeles), Ore-

will defeat the University of the

Scenes of carnage like this were commonplace last night as faculty and
student all-stars, bored with putting each other down in class, started
knocking each other down on the court. A propaganda broadcast from
Shillington’s HQ stated that the Hill squad won, but the students have
asked to interrogate their survivors first.

 

Hill Beats

All-Stars;

Recount Called For

There have been a lot of famous
teams in the history of basketball,
the Original Celtics, the Fiddlin’
Five, the Hank Luisetti-led Stanford
team, and many more. But now there
is a new element injected into this
realm of sport, the Terrible Ten,
better known as the Washington and
Lee Faculty Basketball Team.

Last night in Doremus this collec-
tion of knobby-kneed gentlemen
routed the Fraternity All-Stars, 60-
58, at least by their count.

The faculty starting five of Kozak,
Lowell, Lyles, Eastman, and Phil-
lips (Mickey, of the Information
Service) was matched by students
Shuck Boggs (DU), Randy Poore
(Kappa Sig), Dave Schwinderman
(Pi Phi), Buck Clement (SN), and
Ron Laupheimer (ZBT).

With Ron “Baskethanger” Lau-
pheimer showing the way the stu-
dents pulled into the lead. It was
then that the Faculty began its psy-
cholocial warfare as Herman Tay-
lor lost, not a contact lens, but one
of the lens from his sunglasses.

After the four men pile up (Lyles,
Eastman, Gene Hatfield, and Gray-

 

 

son Powell), the likes of which has
never been seen in the NFL, nor
called a foul in Doremus, the Fac-
ulty closed the gap to 33-18 at the
half.

The high point of the second half
was not Mickey Phillip’s 33-foot
praying set shot, nor Stan “The Man”
Kozak’s bombing sets, nor Norris
Eastman’s driving lay-ups, nor
Norris Eastman’s driving lay-ups,
nor Coach Mac's power plays. It
was not Ed “Hatchet Man” Atwood’s
setting a record for the most uncalled
fouls in one game. It was not the
same star’s move to the worng bas-
ket. It was Coach Keith Shillington.

Never before has anyone called
time-outs or substitutions the way
W&L’s own Red Auerbach did. But
better still was the technical foul.
Coach Shills shot both (yes, two)
shots, and was awarded two points,
one for hitting the rim each time.

Scoring: For the students—Kling-
lehoffer 2, Boggs 2, Poore 7, Wood-
ford 0, Wilson 7, Hawkins 4, Turner

Committee on Publishing’s announc-

we can withdraw all school funds.

Conklin: But they really aren't
the school’s funds, they belong to
the students. Oh yes, I see! We just
don’t remind them of that minor
fact, We'll go on collecting publica-
tions fees from them as usual, and
then decide ourselves what to use
their money for, as usual.

I-to: Wonderful, sort of a torpedo
attack.

Conklin: But let’s remember never
to ask the Committee on Publishing
for its opinion.

Bombed: Nor the Collegians’ Wall
Street Association. Let’s do this in
secret.

I-to: But what if the Student raises
the money on its own?

Minnows: That's simple. We just
ask Mr. Lucky, the print shop super,
not to print the magazine. And of
course, it wouldn't be a bad idea
to ask the area printers too.

Conklin: So even if the “boys”
have the money, they won't have a
printer. My Uncle Total Itarianism
would be proud of a plan like this.

Bombed: A secret plan!

Minnows: A secret, sneaky plan.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Tuesday Edition

A Full And Open Debate

The recent controversy surrounding the Southern Col-
legian is eliciting comment from faculty and students but in
most cases the information available is either incorrect or in-
conclusive. We wish to make some clarification of the issue,
and offer our recommendations.

 

It appears now that Mr. Lauck did not print the Openings
edition of the Collegian simply because the quantity of work
under contract at that time did not permit the necessary time
to publish the magazine. However, Mr. Lauck indicated that
shortly after he had refused the Collegian a member of the
administration stated he was pleased that the print shop had
taken this action and he hoped that the same would be true for
the Fancy Dress edition.

These remarks were not made in any official capacity, but
it is difficult to imagine an absolute lack of pressure on any
future decision which Mr. Lauck might make. In fact Mr.
Lauck stated that he would not have printed the Fancy Dress
edition. Quite obviously, some degree of “unofficial’”’ influ-
ence was applied in a rather clandestine manner.

Although the summary of the student life section of
the Self-Study contained several references to the Collegian
and even a tentative consideration of withholding University
funds from the magazine, the discussion at the open meeting
did not center on the Collegian’s future. The present editor
of the Collegian could not be present, and he did not provide
a spokesman for his position. Consequently, the issue was drop-
ped after a few remarks concerning the possibility of giving
Collegian funds to Ariel.

The Administration contends that this meeting gave stu-
dents ample opportunity to present any defense of the Col-
legian or suggest plausible alternatives. We feel that the vast
majority of students were not aware of the significance of this
meeting nor were they aware of decision of the Self-Study
Committee to recommend to the faculty the suspension of
funds for the Collegian. In the light of this we would urge that
the president delay his final decision on this matter until the
Self-Study Committee has heard from representatives of the
magazine and the Publications Board.

We are not defending or attacking the merits of the Colleg-
ian. We do feel, however, that there are valid points on both
sides, and we earnestly desire a full and open debate on this
question. Hopefully students will take advantage of this oppor-
tunity to examine the Southern Collegian carefully, and articu-
late their views at the proper time.

 

 

Concern And Recalcitrance

Yesterday's record turnout in the Assimilation Committee
poll is perhaps the most encouraging sign on the Washington
and Lee campus in a number of years. The fact that 78 per
cent of the student body participated in the vote indicates the
capacity of W&L men to become genuinely concerned over an
issue. There was certainly nothing apathetical about the stu-
dent body in this instance. However, this concern must con-
tinue,

Interpretation of the poll will be a sticky business, and no
matter how the Executive Committee interprets it, some stu-
dents will be dissatisfied. Recalcitrance on the part of die-hard
dissenters, after the Executive Committee makes a final dis-
position of the matter, can lead only to a pointless sort of
guerilla warfare.

Whatever the Executive Committee decides, it is our obliga-
tion as part of the University to provide their proposal with at
least a non-hostile climate in which to succeed or fail. This
whole discussion of conventional dress and the Assimilation
Committee has come too far and has taken too much effort
to make deliberate thwarting of the Executive Committee's
solution anything more than a childish exhibition of acute
short-sightedness.

We believe that the student body will display the same
commendable concern about the problem after the E.C.’s deci-
sion as they did before it, and cooperate with the E.C. to the
fullest extent.

By DR. JAMES G. LEYBURN

Once again, in March 1966 as as
in April 1880, the pirate sherry will
be poured and the pirate bumper
passed. All knowledgeable Lexing-
tonians will be transported for two
beatific hours to “a rocky sea-shore
on the coast of Cornwall,” near
Penzance.

Swiftly Flowing

Wits and music-lovers of eight de-
cades—peers and plebeians, premiers
and poets, prelates, and puritans,
princes and plenipotentiaries (not to
mention pirates and _ policemen)—
have relished the gay satire of this
third Gilbert and Sullivan opera, The
Pirates of Penzance. It is a favorite
of school-boys no less than of Oxford
dons. Much of its humor, no matter
how swiftly it flows, is obvious to
the veriest groundling; but as al-
ways, the knowing are sure that
only their select few have caught the

subtleties and the allusions of both
words and music.

We shall be in goodly company
when the curtain opens. There are
the notorious pirates, who can scut-
tle a Cunarder or vary their piracy
with a little burglary; the doughty
policemen—whose lot, alas, is not
a happy one; and Major-General
Stanley’s irresistible daughters who,
when the pirates first see them, dis-
cover “a first-rate opportunity to
get married with impunity, and in-
dulge in the felicity of unbounded
domesticity” (married of course, by
a doctor of divinity who resides in
this vicinity).

Major-General Stanley

Major General Stanley himself
candidly admits that it is a glorious
thing to be a Major-General, and he
proves his superiority by reciting
the varied information (animal, veg-
etable, and mineral) he has at his

Columnists Attack Faculty’s
Outdated Teaching M ethods

By ED WOOD

and KEN CARO

Why isn’t there intellectual ex-
citement and involvement at Wash-
ington and Lee? The answer seems
to include a number of causes most
of which can be easily ascertained
by any thoughtful student. However,
we believe one cause is generally
ignored in mass analysis of this
question. This cause is the existence
of certain teaching methods through-
out our faculty that reflect laziness,
pedantry or downright incompe-
tence.

Ad Nauseam

Other exams require the memori-
zation of extensive lists. A good
grade in such courses depends upon
a student's ability to pound A parts,
B parts, C parts, D, E, F,—“ad nau-
seam,” into the protesting faculties
of his mind. To the purveyors of
such tripe we students ask whether
our education is really furthered by
a momentary familiarity with un-
assimable oceans of small facts? We
ask also whether knowledge, wis-

finger-tips—though he has ruefully
to admit his military knowledge has
only been brought down to the be-
ginning of the century.

Every character is beguiling:
Mabel, who is a coloratura aria,
feels the moral beauty of falling in
love with Frederic, the ex-pirate
apprentice; her sisters Edith, Kate,
and Isabel, who wonder whether,
“had he not been a thing of beauty,
would she be swayed by quite as
keen a sense of duty?”; Ruth, the
piratical maid-of-all-work, who
quaintly mistook the word “pilot”
for “pirate,” and whose love has
been accumulating “forty-seven
year”; The Pirate King, who has a
pretty taste for paradox, and Sam-
uel, his lieutenant, who with equal
aplomb dispenses sherry and crow-
bars, dark lanterns and skeletonic
keys.

Sullivan Outdoes Gilbert

The wit of Gilbert is matched by
the genius of Sullivan, who is at
his Mozartean best. He combines in
counterpoint the chattering chorus,
in 2/4 time, with the 3/4 rhapsody
of Mabel and Frederick, and later
indulges in the even more complex
counterpoint of the scene in which
the daughters try to inspire the
dwindling courage of the policemen
(tarantara!). Other high spots are
the Major-General’s famous patter
song, Mabel’s waltz aria «and her
farewell duel with it dying fall, and
the policemen’s intoned replies and
their reflections upon the woes of
constabulary duty. It can be—has
been—claimed that in this opera
Sullivan outdoes Gilbert in sparkle,
sophistication, and subtley.

As always among those who love
Gilbert and Sullivan, whether

NSA Editorial ‘‘A musing”

Editor, Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

The editorial obituary on the NSA
last Tuesday attempted to land a
strong parting blow upon us “active
patriots.” By being egregiously un-
informed the writer made an amus-
ing though intelligently unappeal-
ing effort.

Throwing out the McCarthy ma-
larky, which itself gave a very much
overcooked “red herring” flavor to
the entire editorial, there are two
points worth mentioning.

1) Who was “consciously misrepre-
senting” NSA membership costs? As
stated in the editorial: “The actual
BASIC (my emphasis) fee would
have been $15.” I think that most of
us, however, were led by the NSA
proponents to believe that W&L
would have been an active member
of NSA and even be represented at
the annual summer convention, In
this way those marvelous minority
reports could be filed and thereby
disassociate our school from the
outlandish political positions taken
by NSA. The average cost, one will
find as we did, for schools our size
to participate in the function of the
NSA amounted to about $600 an-
nually.

2) Having gaved our school some
money by apparently not sending
delegates to the convention, our R-t
P man out of the scene lumbers, in
his characteristically maladroit fash-
ion, through the political criticism
of NSA. Because the NSA has fought
“Communist-dominated student or-
ganizations” and is definitely not a
“junior adjunct of the international
Communist conspiracy” therefore...

Therefore what? Does this mean

This week’s celluloid offering at
the State, Made in Paris, engenders

except the term

But writhing about in this more

Special recognition was also given
her for stumbling over one of the
more taxing phrases in the English

a mixmaster in 2nd gear), she can

66-67 Wrestling Captains Named

Don Patterson

By RAY ZELTNER

Don Patterson and Warren Stew-
art will lead the 1966-67 wrestlers
as Co-captains, it was announced
last Friday night at a banquet in
the back room of the College Inn.
Both are Juniors and both have
lettered twice.

The wrestlers had voted for the
captains after the last match with
the University of Virginia, three
weeks ago. Trophys for the best
freshman wrestler and the wrestler
who did the most for the team will
be awarded later at the spring sports
banquet.

Letter Sweaters

Letter sweaters were also award-
ed at the banquet. First-letter men
in wrestling were: Sophomore Rolly
Jacobs, 123 lb.; Senior Jim Bruton,
130 lb.; Freshman Charlie Slaughter,
152 lb.; Freshman Bobby Munson.;

Warren Stewart

167 lb.; Freshman Clarke Carter,

and Junior Don Patterson, 145 lb.;
Senior Co-captain Kemble White,

certificates in recognition of their
earning additional letters.

Season Reviewed

The team finished the season with
a 4-5 season. Defeats were suffered
at the hands of the University of
Virginia, Duke University, Old Do-
minion, and North Carolina State.
Victories were won at the Univer-
sity of North Carolina, University
of West Virginia, Loyola, and Wil-
liam and Mary.

 

 

 

veteran first midfield and a hard-
hitting close defense. The first mid-
field will be composed of seniors Jay
Bowersox, Billy Andrews, and Bruce
Jackson. This midfield will be count-
ed on heavily for scoring punch as
well as rugged defense.

The defense, headed by all-Amer-
ican Lance Bendann, Warren Stew-
art, and Ben Gambill, should be
the strong point of the team. Ben-
dann, Andrews, and Bowersox are
the team captains.

Backing up the first midfield will
be an inexperienced second unit. This
unit will include either Pete Took-

i ler, Hugh Baugher, Kip Armstrong,
or Clint Murchison. A

third unit
of either Terry Griffin, Ed Crawford,
Ralph Schenkel, or Clark Carter will
also be slated to see plenty of ac-

tion,

Adding to the depth of the defense
are freshman standout Charley
Stewart and sophomores Holmes
Raker, Harold Stowe, and Mike
Miles.

Depleted by the graduation of
high-scoring Caroll Klinglehoffer,
the attack will be a bit shy of ex-
perience this year. Returning crease-
man Tom Pittman and Chip Chew
who saw action at both midfield and
attack last year will be counted to
pick up most of the slack.

The third attack spot will from
freshmen candidates Roger Israel,
Joe Wich, Jim Chance, and Wade

Sophomore Dave Johnson shows
all the promise of developing into
an outstanding netminder. Jim Daw-
son will back him up.

While not yet ready to tackle

hopeful and awaiting the upcoming
season with anticipation.

Dom Flora ranks as one of W&L’s athletic greats.

Dom Flora: Legendary Hero
Of Doremus Gym Basketball

This past season saw the emer-
gence of a new look for Washing-
ton and Lee basketball teams of
of the future. Leading this rise was
a freshman, Rob Bauer from At-
lanta, Ga., who brought faint re-
semblance to those who remember
the greatest basketball player in
Washington and Lee history. Dom
Flora.

Dom Flora came to Washington
and Lee in the fall of 1954 after
playing three sports for Dickinson
High in Jersey City, New Jersey.
Dom had decided to come to W&L
because he wanted to play football
here. But the summer before he
was to enroll, W&L dropped the
1954 schedule and subsidized football
was gone for good. He came to Lex-
ington anyway, and played baseball
and basketball for Coach Bill Mc-
Cann. While he was a fine baseball
player with professional aspirations,
Dom was to write his name in the
record books as a basketball player.

 

A Starter Always

A starter from the moment he
stepped on the court in Doremus
Gym, Dom began his assult on the
records as a freshman. In 29 games
that year he scored 553 points, a
mere two points from the record for
the most points scored by a fresh-
man for a season at a major col-
lege.

In 1955-56 Dom’s sophomore year,
the General’s attack was crippled
as Dom’s scoring partner, Lee Mar-
shall, was injured during much of
the season. But Dom refused to quit
as the team’s record slumped to
a 12-16 mark. That year saw Dom
score 607 points for a 21.7 average,
and his two year total of 1,160 was
only 15 shy of the NCAA record
for total points scored as a fresh-
man-sophomore.

Strong Rebounder

With Marshall back in 1956, Dom's

burden was eased, and he was able

Baseball Squad

Enters Season

By GIL TURNER

The Generals enter their third
week of pre-season practice this
week after a very impressive show-
ing in their first nine inning inter-
squad game this past Saturday.
Coach Joe Lyles was quite pleased
and optimistic after the “W” or first
unit defeated the “L” or second
team by a 12-6 margin. Almost all
of the team saw some action in the
game, with the team coming now to
the reckoning point of weeding out
the top players to make up the start-
ing squad for the season opener
after the spring vacation break.

Looking first to the pitching staff,
the starting hurlers in the intersquad
game. Pete Heumann and Jim Coop-
er were both very impressive, each
going four strong innings. Other pit-
chers were John Johnson, Rick Car-
son, Lee Halford, and Bill Rasmus-
sen. Although it is still early, the
mound staff is shaping up well with
Heumann, Cooper, Rasmussen, and
freshman Phil Runyon the prime
contenders for opening chores.

Infielders in Action

In the field, the “W” squad fielded
Ed Bishop at third, Franklin Thom-
as at short, Eric Sisler at second,
and Luke Crosland at first. Senior
Dick Kirkpatrick was not present
but is a contender for the shortstop
position. On the “L” squad were
Roddy Roediger at third, Gil Turner
at short, E. H. Ball at second, and
Jack Anthony at first. Other players
to see action were Gill Fitzhugh at
second, John Nazzaro at first, and
Ron Shortt at third.

As far as the outfield goes, the
tops so far are Thom Mitchell,
Charlie Freret, and Ed Mitchell. On
the second line are Bill Schaefer,
Gary Apgar, and Steve Jones.

Future Is Bright
An overlook at the game on Sat-
urday shows that the hitters are
finally coming around since the be-
ginning of the season. Each team col-
lected seven hits with many mis-
takes accounting for a few of the
runs. However, the time between the

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Faculty Discusses Collegian

(Continued from page 1)

Withdrawal of Funds

On December 8, Dean John dis-
tributed a limited progress report
on the Self-Study Committee. This
was distributed to the Ring-tum
Phi and all fraternities. Included
in this report is the Collegian ques-

tion, “Should Washington and Lee
remove its sponsorship of _ this
publication?” Direct reference is

made to the possibility of accom-
plishing this by “withholding of
funds.”

Meetings on December 14 and 15
were allowed students to discuss
the contents. While no students ap-
peared at the first meeting, only
four attended the second. Dean John,
who presided, said that direct refer-
ence was made to the black fate of
the Collegian by a student. When
this was agreed to, no further dis-
cussion was pursued. Dean John
said, “I expected a longer debate
on the magazine’s pros and cons, but
the students didn’t push the subject.”

The Collegian was again scheduled
in the Self-Study Committee in
February. On February 9, the meet-
ing came to the decision that uni-
versity patronage should be removed
from the Collegian. Acting on this
decision, Dean Atwood told Mr.
Lauck not to print the Springs edi-
tion.

Lack of Response

According to Dr. J. D. Cook, mem-
ber of the Publications Board, his
board was simply too late. “The
purpose of our March 8 meeting was
to discuss the Collegian, but this was
not known outside of the Publica-
tions Board. Neither did we ever
make a public proposition to spon-
discussion at

sor a student-faculty
that time.’ Dr. Cook placed the
blame on the Publications Board,

the students, and the Ring-tum Phi.
He said that students didn’t take ad-
vantage of their opportunity in De-
cember, and that the Ring-tum Phi
should have given the issues more
publicity. The Collegian editors of
the last few years were made aware
of the faculty’s desires, yet they had
never taken any action to defend
their magazines. Dr. Cook also de-
nied the validity of the late Collegian
poll because of its biased questions.

The clause in the student consti-
tution which mentions the Southern
Collegian s states: “The following or-

Dom also proved strong under the

But disappointment was to mat
Dom's final year as he was unable
to carry his team into the Southern

had been in for three years. Closing
his career with 18 points against
Villanova, Dom moved into 5th place

tions as the Executive Committee
shall designate...shall receive al-

these organizations, On February 19,
1964, Dean Atwood sent a letter
to William Noell, then president of
the student body, requesting that the

Collegian “from the list of publica-
tions receiving funds...” Dean At-

wood said that the Executive Com-
mittee told him that it didn’t have
the power to take such action, that
only a student referendum could
do it.

Further Consideration

Dean Atwood remarked that the
interpretation of the clause has been
varied. The official interpretation is
that the Executive Committee has
power only to distribute the funds
to the university-sponsored publica-
tions. Sponsorship shall be decided
by faculty.

In a statement, Dean Atwood
told: “...both the faculty and the
Self-Study Committee have expres-
sed the opinion that the Southern
Collegian does not justify the sub-
sidization... Certainly these bodies
have a right to express their opin-

 

ion...

“Tf a case can be made...I feel
that the administration,
the responsibility for act-
ing on the faculty resolution, will
wish to take this into consideration
before taking final action.”

Facilities Of
Campus Cited
In Self-Study

By CHRIS MILLS

The open discussion meeting on the
Self-Study Committee’s report on
the campus and its facilities, attend-
ed by seven students, concerned it-
self primarily with the inadequacy
of the University’s shortcomings in
providing adequate drama facilities
for improved productions and ex-
perimentation.

While commenting that the campus
is sufficient in area to accommodate
any “foreseeable expansions,” the
report added that the placement of
buildings west of Washington Hall
was “unfortunate.” The method of
moving traffic into the parking
spaces from Washington Street was
also scored. In discussing parking, the
statement said: “Parking is amply
provided for on campus, but some
of the areas are remote and many
are unpaved.”

“A few classrooms” were cited as
“undesirable, particularly with re-
spect to ventilation and light.” Al-
though stating that the University
“is currently accommodating all
classes at their scheduled times,”
the self-study continued, “There is
a need for greater flexibility in
scheduling, however, particularly in
regard to the use of the so-called
‘undesirable’ class hours of 8:25 and
12:05.” When questioned about the
word “undesirable,” Pollard admit-
ted that, “Some faculty members
really dislike teaching at 8:25 and
12:05 especially the ‘J’ hour.

In an interesting suggestion, the
committee recommended the _ re-
modeling of the Old Freshman Dor-
mitory to accommodate fewer stu-
dents; this would necessitate the
construction of another residence for
freshmen.

Doremus Gymnasium was con-
demned as “inadequate for present
use.” After commenting that plans

are already under way to build an-
other gym, the report said the old
should be kept, “partly because of
the convenience and partly because
of the expense of doing anything
else with it.”

Four Students
Deliver Petition

To Rep. Laird

Four W&L students journeyed to
Washington last Tuesday, March 15,
to present a petition supporting
Vietnam measures to Rep. Melvin R
Laird, (R-Wisconsin).

Representing the Clarence J.
Brown Young Republican Club and
the Washington and Lee Young Re-
publican Club were Raymond J.
Lajeunesse, Jr., Chairman of the
Law School YR club; Kearnons
Whaien Ili.  seeretary-treasurer;
Donald O'Sullivan, program and
planning chairman; and Arthur M.
Love, representative from the under-
graduate club.

The petition which has been cir-
culated throughout the University
contained 406 signatures or roughly
one-third of the student body.

Rep. Laird received the delegation
in his office and later submitted the
petition to the Congressional Record.

Rep. Laird commented in the
Record: “Mr. Speaker, I think it is
significant that the resolution

will be “Batman.”

As was done last year, the cock-
tail party will be held in the back
yard of the Phi Kap house on Fri-
day afternoon. No admission will
be charged for non-fraternity stu-
dents.

“Georgia punch, a very Southern
very traditional-type drink,” which
is a mixture of gin, lemons, limes,
and other unannounced ingredients,
is being planned as_ refreshment in
in effort to match the trend set by
the Fancy Dress Cocktail Party's
mint juleps.

“Our problem is collecting all the
junior dues that are still lacking,”
said Holladay. He estimated that
approximately $200 in dues have not
yet been paid, and that unless these
funds can be collected some of the
plans for the cocktail party will have
to be changed to something less ex-
pensive.

Fontella Bass, who is scheduled to
perform at the party, started her

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Friday Edition

No Sabotage, ie...

Considering public and private statements made by mem-
bers of the administration and faculty on the decision to with-
draw funds from the Southern Collegian, we must admit that
there was probably no deliberate faculty design to sabotage
the magazine by stealth. Nevertheless, the essential fact re-
mains that in a faculty decision deeply involving student con-
stitution and custom, the student body was taken by surprise.

It is the administration-faculty contention that a self-study
hearing and a brief criticism of the Southern Collegian at the
bottom of the seventh page of a thick report constituted sufh-
cient warning to the student body, and that it was thus not
necessary to seek student opinion in the matter. If the faculty
really believed this, it exhibited an incredible naivete of student
nature,

The self-study report consisted of twelve mimeographed
pages of rhetorical questions and recommendations which was
quietly made available to the students. Considering the heavy
academic and social activities of the students, plus the very
unemphatic nature of the self-study, how many students real-
ized how significant the self-study’s recommendations might
be? Very few indeed, a fact which should have been readily
obvious to self-study, administration, and faculty alike. There-
fore, it is hard to accept that these groups conscientiously be-
lieved the students had been sufficiently warned about the
Collegian issue before the vote was taken.

Either the self-study is out of touch with the students, or it
must have “conveniently overlooked” student unawareness
and the Publications Board’s intention to discuss the Collegian.
The self-study committee should not have presented the Col-
legian proposal without making a similar and simultaneous pro-
posal to the Executive Committee, Publications Board, or both.
And no matter who is to blame for student unawareness, the
student body should never have been taken by surprise on
such an important issue.

With this, we hope to let the unpleasant subject drop,
nevertheless noting that the “Pearl Harbor’ appearance of
the Southern Collegian vote has noticeably created division
and distrust between faculty and students at a time when

W&L hardly needs more dissention. C. W. M.

 

One- Way Communications

If the Southern Collegian controversy has done nothing
else, it has certainly underscored an unfortunate failure of
faculty-student communications at W&L. Had adequate com-
munications existed, the dispute over the Collegian case would
have been limited to the magazine’s value.

The fllow of information on this campus is markedly one-
way. The faculty is kept well-informed on student thought
and planning through the student newspapers, the student
Executive Committee, the LF.C., and other organs of stu-
dent expression. However, the faculty’s opinions and plans
are almost a total enigma to the students. The faculty’s de
pendence on self-study reports and hearings to inform the
students has been a total failure, as the Southern Collegian
case has superabundantly demonstrated.

To prevent misunderstandings between students and
faculty, the faculty should take greater pains to keep the stu-
dents informed. We urge that the self-study committee inves-
tigate this serious problem of communications. Possible ways
of achieving a flow of information from faculty to students
would be: (1) for the faculty to issue periodical statements of
its deliberations on issues affecting the students; (2) for facul-
ty representatives to attend the student E.C. as liaison agents;
or (3) for student representatives or reporters to be admitted
to those parts of faculty meetings which deal with student
affairs.

As one looked at the ODK board,
visited the ROTC department, and
read the Ring-tum Phi these recent
weeks, he could

One thing par-

while that which supported it was
receiving relatively poor response.
It is on this basis that I have chosen
to explore the subject further.

The thesis of anti-Vietnam litera-
ture at W&L has been that we view
Red China as the international “bad-
guy,” when, in reality, is is we who
have the Chinese and Russians en-
circled by missle bases, and it is we
who are fighting on another conti-
nent. In reality, their argument goes,
China and Russia will not start a
war if we first leave them alone. We

Committed to Destroy Us

First of all, the Communists have
openly admitted that they are com-
mitted to the destruction of capital-
ism and capitalist governments the
world over. Was not Marx who
led three revolutionary groups of
laborers in his time, and did he not
advocate revolution the world over?
Was it not Lenin who drew up the
blueprint for world revolution, in-

cluding infiltration of army units
disobedience to the law, allegiance
to Moscow, infiltration of labor un-

Was it not Stalin who advocated

operation and then striking at the
opportune moment? Was it not]
Khrushchev who declared that the
United States will be buried (and
he didn't mean just economically)

and that our grandchildren will live
under Communism?

Now the agitators for withdrawal
might say “But these men are not
in power anymore; they are from
an old Russia that no longer exists;
today the Russians want coexist-
ence.” It would be nice if that were
the case, and idealists can’t be
blamed for wanting to believe this.
But I have not heard the current
Soviet or Chinese leadership repu-
diate this philosophy; have you? It
is a dangerous position to assume
that the entire basis for the Com-
munist philosophy has changed in
the last few years. and on top of
that, while the Russians have quieted
down a little, the Chinese are still
screaming. I see no basis for an
assumption that Russia, with a little
more food in its stomach, has chang-
ed its planned course of action; and
without doubt, China hasn’t changed
its.

Changed Philosophy

In summary, it seems that the Com-
munists have not changed their phil-
osophy and are aggressors. No one
is saying that the US. is pure; God
knows we have a national interest
in Vietnam. But who seems to be
starting the trouble?

Again let me emphasize that I
make no claim of being “right.” If

I did, I am sure I would suffer
humiliation at the hands of such
superior writers as Bob Lee and

Nick Ruffin. What I do maintain,
though, is that the above endeavor
(as piecemeal as it may be) does
present a viewpoint worthy of con-
sideration and rational thought.

ZBTs Walk Away = Ast Trivia Title

Faculty And |
Pi Phi Tie
For Second

By CLARK KENT
Mild-Manner Reporter
Superb conditioning and instant
reflexes paid off for ZBT last night
as the duo of Paul Schlesinger and
Charlie Bensinger walked away from
three other teams in the finals of
the first annual Ring-tum  Phi-

Radio W&L Trivia Contest.

The champions scored a total of
275 points to beat out the Faculty
team of Paxton Davis and Frank
Parsons and the Pi Phi entry of
Steve Millard and Rich Johnson,
who each had 150. Finishing in
fourth place was the Kappa Sig
duo, Randy Poore and Dave
Mathewson. They had a _ credible
100 points.

For their victory, the winners re-
ceived a bottle of champagne and the
coveted Jennings Cup, which was
seen and admired by hundreds of
students in the library display case
before the show. Schlesinger also
received a complete selection
last Sunday’s comic sections in rec-
ognition of his being named the
school’s Most Trivial Student.

Second and third prizes were di-
vided between the runners-up. The
Pi Phis got a 1962 Variety and
Avengers comic No. 3, while Parsons
and Davis were awarded a copy of
the Information Please Almanac for
1960 and Metamorpho the Element
Man No. 4.

A special award—The Mr. I. Mag-
ination prize for Original and En-
tertaining Answers—went to the SPE
team of Steve Saunders and Tom
Doss, who enlivened their last place
finish on the prelimiarny quiz with
such responses as “Mauve Candle”
(to “Who was Green Lantern’s side-
kick?”) and “Oneman” (to “What
was One Man's Family's name?”).

The ZBT’s were never headed as
they answered the first two questions
in a row before the faculty broke
into the scoring column by naming
Grace Kelley’s leading men. Their
lead was 35 points with the faculty
in second place, when scorekeeper
Keith Shillington announced the first
running score.

In the second period the winners
broke the opposition’s back, reeling
off several answers in a row to
lead 235 to 100 at the end of the
period. They slumped in the final
third, accumulating only 40 points
while the Phi Phis stageed a strong
comeback, but the meet was al-
ready on ice by that time.

Former Washington and Lee Uni-

versity wrestling coach Archie E.
Mathis, whose teams from 1925 to
| 1942 dominated southern collegian

competion, has been named to the
Helms Athletic Foundation Amateur
Wrestling Hall of Fame.

Mathis who died in 1945, joined
the W&lIL staff in the same year he
was graduated from the University
of Illinois after a brilliant collegiate
wrestling career. Under Mathis’
leadership, the Generals ruled vir-
tually supreme over southern col-
leges and universities, but also put
their record on the line against
schools which had established them-
selves as powers in other regions.

In all, the 17-year Mathis coaching
span produced nine undefeated
teams, 14 winning seasons, one
break-even year, and only two los-
ing campaigns. From 1929 until his
last year at W&L,, Mathis’ wrestlers

F-soxicund Even Writes Trivial Column

By CHARLIE BENSINGER
Dear Mom and Dad,

Well, with epic events occurring
this week on our hill-topped cam-
pus I must resign
myself to sports
and also to intra-
murals,

Observations

Texas Western is actually for real,
but I can see them for a second, and
no farther.

The Duke-Kentucky game will
feature two very similar teams, and
the winner should go all the way.

The N.LT. becomes less import-
ant and less prestigeous each year.
Look at the records of the teams
this year, and then remember that
two of them are without their stars

what records their teams have.

The Dodgers won’t have a chance
without Koufax and Drysdale, and
will be hurting for a month even
if the Dynamic Duo does sign now,
just because they won't be in shape.

If George Chuvalo beats Clay, then
I can beat Chuvalo...and Clay...
all in the same night.

Washington and Lee’s Bob Bauer

Bauer, who is only a freshman but
led the Generals in scoring with a

Mathis Named To Hall Of Fame

(Continued from page 3)

Among the stronger teams W&L
faced during that time were Frank-
lin & Marshall, Michigan, Michigan
State, Northwestern, Princeton,
Army, Navy, Kansas State, and Tlli-
nois.

Mathis helped inaugurate the first
Southern Conference wrestling tour-
nament in 1930. His teams won four

of the first eight league tourneys,
finished second twice, and third
twice.

1 The Generals, by virtue of their
undefeated record, laid claim to
the Southern Conference title in

five years when no tournament was
held. As much as Mathis did to
promote wrestling among conference
schools, his excellent teams domi-
nated the sport to such an extent
that in several years no tourney
was held for lack of challengers.
Through the reputation of his
wrestling teams and because of his
personal efforts, Mathis was able to
persuade the NCAA to hold its na-
tional championships at W&L in
1936, the first and last time the
NCAA, finals were ever held in the
South. An added feature of the
event was the conduct of semi-final
trials for the Olympic Games sched-

uled later that year in Berlin, Ger-
many.
In 1942, Mathis joined the U. S.

Navy and, after three years of ser-
vice, was discharged. He returned
to the University of Illinois imme-
diately to join the physical educa-
tion staff, and died short time
later.

Mathis is one of seven men chosen
for the Hall of Fame this year and
joins a roster of 86 wrestlers, coach-
es, and contributors to the sport al-
ready honored.

Dick Miller, W&L’s current wrest-
ling coach, will accept the award.

that students were not consulted in
any way by the Self-Study Com-

Hash also said the administration
states that it did not “cut off” dis-
cussion about the Collegian in the
general Self-Study - Student-Life
meeting, but that no one had been
prepared to defend or argue in favor
of the Collegian. The matter, ac-
cording to the Hill, was eligible for
discussion at the time, as indicated
at the bottom of page seven of a
“Summary” released in advance by
the Student Life group, which spoke
of the possibility of withholding the

At the present time, Washington

formerly inferior colleges. If they
are improving at a faster rate, they
will surpass us. W&L will be reduced
from a position of good college to

its existence.

W&L YOUNG REPUBLICAN President Roger Wallace receives “Outstand-
ing Club” Award from Congressman William H. Ayers.

‘Collegian’ Issue
Sent To Student
Affairs By Cole

President Fred C. Cole has writ-
ten to Publications Board President
Drew Baur, indicating that the ques-
tion of the Southern Collegian would
be referred again to the faculty’s
Student Affairs Committee. The
President's action came in the wake
of a continued controversy over the
faculty's recommendation that funds
for the humor magazine be dropped.

The Collegian was started dur-
ing the administration of President
Robert E. Lee, in 1868, and was
a literary magazine until well into
this century. The faculty, in with-
drawing its support said the publi-
cation was in poor taste and reflect-
ed badly on the University.

The Publications Board immedi-
ately passed a resolution urging re-
consideration and questioning the
supposedly “secretive” handling of
the matter. The Student Body Ex-
ecutive Committee supported the
Publications Board's position, and
passed a resolution of endorsement.

In other Publications Board busi-
ness, it was announced that M:
James Boatwright has agreed to fill
the vacancy on the Board caused by
the resignation of Dr. Sydney M. B
Coulling. Dr. Coulling described the
for his resignation as “en-
tirely personal,” involving other
commitments, and not having any
connection with the Collegian con-
troversy

The Washington and

IFC Proposes
New Definitions
For Functions

By JOHN LEE

At last night’s IFC meting, two
constitutional amendments as well as
several other proposals were dis-
cussed. A new definition of social
functions to include the four Uni-
versity dance weekends and seven
combo weekends clarifies the vague-
ness Of the past definitions. As
stated in the IFC constitution, “a
social function shall be any affair,
excluding meals, a.) involving mem-
bers and their dates and b.) paid for
with fraternity funds (with or with-
out musical entertainment).”

A new provision for “chip-in”
parties are those “differing from the
University Dance Weekends and the
seven “Combo Weekends” in that
each individual member or pledge of
the sponsoring fraternity is given an
opportunity to choose whether or
not to contribute towards the cost
of such social function. Paid musical
entertainment is not allowed at any
“chip-in” party.

The proposed _ constitutional
amendment that each fraternity
work with a CPA rather than Dean
Dean Atwood on house finances, was
defeated. Many of the houses felt
that the suggested system would
place too stringent rules upon their
financial operation. The proposal
which had previously been passed
by the Student Affairs Comimttee,
will discussed by that com-
mittee, and an informal poll will be
taken of all fraternity’s suggestions

concerning a satisfactory financial
system.

Lee Club was especially recognized
se

its success last November in
carrying Rockbridge County for the

first time in a century. The Club
this year also presented several
outstanding Republican speakers,

sponsored a Political Action Course,
increased membership more than 23
per cent to include over a quarter
of the student body, and hosted the
weekend convention at Natural
Bridge.
New Chairman

The new Chairman of the Virginia
CYR Federation has a broad Repub-
lican background which began in his
hometown of Fort Worth, Texas
Roger Wallace was active in the
1960 Presidential Campaign for Nix-
on, helped organize Teen Age Re-
publican clubs in Texas and in 1963
was named the Outstanding Teen
Age Republican in the Nation. Wal-
lace is a rising senior at Washington
and Lee. Besides serving as YF Club
President, in 1964 he was YF Chair-
man at W&L, and attended the Na-
tional Republican Convention in San
Francisco as Chief Page for the Re-
publican National Committee Pub-
lic Relations Division.

Convention Hosts

As convention hosts, W&L stu-
dents participated in every phase of
convention activity. Nearly forty
W&L students participated as dele-
gates or in the planning for the
three-day affair. Sophomore Jeff
Wainscott was Convention Co-ordi-
nator while Alan Rains and Art
Love served as Arrangements Com-
mittee Co-chairmen.

The Natural Bridge Convention
had representatives from sixty-
seven Young Republican, College

Young Republican, and Teen Age
Republican clubs. The main order

ing session included Margaret Col-
bert, a sophomore from Sweet Bria:
College, who was elected First Vice-

The Perennial Problem

Shortly after the spring recess the campus will once again
be the center of intense political activity. The elections for
student body officers and the class elections will occupy most
month of April. If last year’s pattern is any indication of the
chaos we can expect, it would be wise for the Executive Com-
mittee to take steps to avoid another free-for-all.

Political Parties

The exact manner of handling elections has been the
source of particular concern for the E.C., and a workable so-
lution is not yet formulated. The question of political parties
inevitably occupies a part of any discussion on elections and
procedures. If the two-party system returns to the campus this
spring, it will necessarily be the product of spontaneous gener-
ation. The E.C. cannot arbitrarily impose political order of the
student body regardless of its merits.

Increased apathy

Perhaps the idea of some party organization is still repul-
sive to a large majority of students, but we would submit that
some sort of stream-lining in the nomination process would be
welcomed by candidates and voters alike. The unfortunate
aspect of multiple candidacies is that the student body becomes
even more apathetic than usual. By the second run-off it is
surprising to have over half of the membership of the student
body voting. Certainly, this is not a healthy political climate.

We do not have any plan or proposal which will eliminate
the problems which elections have encountered at W&L over
the last few years. The issue can, however, be ignored only at
the risk of impairing effective and responsible student govern-
ment.

Wanted: Talent And Time

In the past year the absence of the Southern Conservative
has been particularly distressing to us. For several years it has
occupied a respected place among the publications of our Uni-
versity community. Its wide circulation outside the campus
attracted additional contributions, both financial and literary.
Perhaps the most valuable aspect of this newspaper was its
responsible position among articulate conservative journals on
the college campus.

 

Long on Funds

According to reports from the present editor of this pub-
lication, Jim Bruton, it seems that funds are available, but there
is a shortage of individuals to assemble an issue. The Conserva-
tive Society which is a separate organization is also interested
in reviving the Conservative, but has not yet enlisted adequate
support. We would like to urge any students interested in the
technical or editorial areas of newspaper work to contract Mr.
Bruton for further information concerning the opportunities

available on The Southern Conservative.

Short on Talent

We firmly believe that the Southern Conservative like the
Collegian is suffering from a lack of talent which in the former
case is fatal and in the latter case is likely to be so. The South-
ern Conservative should be a dynamic force not only on this
campus, but also on the dozens of campuses across the country
which actively support it. Certainly this newspaper can be and,
indeed, has been a distinctive characteristic of Washington and
Lee. It will be a credit to the entire University of publication
can be resumed in the outstanding tradition of former years.

A Much-Needed Revival

The traditionally Republican orientation of Washington
and Lee has stifled any attempts at building a strong Young
Democrats Club on campus to compete with the Young Re-
publicans. For many years, Young Democrats had barely
enough members to fill all of its officer positions.

Under the leadership of Faculty adviser William Chaffin,
the Young Democrats have achieved a remarkable success.
Membership has reached the highest level in years and in-
terest in the club and its activities has increased greatly.

State Officers Elected

Their success this year was capped off this weekend when
two W&L Young Democrats were elected to state office in
their organization. Law School Freshman Dick Israel was elect-
ed Western Vice Chairman of the Virginia Federation of Col-
lege Young Democrats and Academic Freshman Ray Hart-
well was elected Vice Chairman of the Seventh District Vir
ginia Federation of Young Democrats.

We extend our congratulations to the new officers, and
also to those men whose efforts on the local level at Washing-
ton and Lee to strengthen the Young Democrats resulted in
their victory this past weekend.

By WARD BRIGGS

I cannot say too much about The
Pawnbroker. The performance of
Steiger as Sol Nazerman the pawn-
broker is extraordinary. His is by
turns a young German Jew with a
beautiful wife and family, a prisoner
at Auschwitz, forced to witness his
own wife in a brothel, and an ag-
ing pawnbroker in Spanish Harlem.
He sleeps with the wife of his best
friend whom he saw torn to pieces
by a dog and he supports her. He
stays with his wife’s sister on Long
Island and supports them. He is
attracted by a middle-aged, saggy
social worker, but avoids a rela-
tionship with her that might have
brought to him a measure of human-
ity.

He hires a Puerto Rican boy who
only wants to rib him, and teaches
him to “tell gold” and count money
above all else. He is a front man for
a Negro gangster, hesitating to ful-
fill the demands only when he learns
that his money comes in part from a
brothel. He gives away money to
alcoholics and junkies because they
are no more to him than human
junk,

The ugliness and horror of this
world force Nazerman to resign from

it altogether, to destroy himself, as
he feels his entire race has done,
and becores entirely devoted to the
process fo making money, This be-
comes his sole concern until at last
he is suddenly, in the three days
we glimpse on film, transformed into
a feeling human being.

His family had been dead for
twenty years, and his only reality
had been money. But suddenly the
years of anguish well up and ex-
plode in a mute, horrible grimace
that is as powerful as any of his
brilliant tirades against the world he
so frequently lends himself to.

He must, at the end, face the pain
of life. He cannot ignore the poor
winos and junkies any longer, so
he gives them they money they so
desire. He cannot obey the Big Boss
(Brock Peters) who in my opinion
is the finest Negro actor in America:
ef. To Kill a Mockingbird and L-
Shaped Room). He cannot be run
over by the Puerto Rican hoods, so
he obdurately refuses to be robbed
by them. And he cannot face the
violence of the world in which he
lives so he impales his hand on a
spike as if the expiate sins done on
his account.

Throughout this series of incidents,

 

    

Steiger is consistently brilliant in
the part of a cynic which might
seem deceptively easy to play. Brock
Peters is his usually Negroid self,
playing a different stereotype to the
hilt in each movie in which he per-
forms.

Geraldine Fitzgerald as the con-
fined social worker is sufficiently
impressive to warrant mention, Sid-
ney Lumet’s (The Hill, Long Days
Journey Into Night) direction brings
all the action home by placing it
squarely in the midst of Spanish
Harlem. This sense of locale together
with the constant, cage-like shadows
which play on Steiger’s face while
he is in the pawn shop are most ef-
fective.

To me, the most memorable parts
of the movie are the cameo portray-
als of the people who pawn things.
The intellectual Negro wino who
wants to pawn his latest literary ac-
quisition, the courtly old Negro with
the butterfly collection. the white
teenage junkies with the recalcitrant
radio, and the pregnant young girl
are beautifully and touchingly pro-
trayed, if a bit too melodramatically
hand-picked.

The most touching of all is the

Law School Found To Be

By EDMUND BURKE
To whom it may concern:

I would like to take this oppor-
tunity to thank whoever it was,
whether a law student or Mr. Rob-
ertson, who cleaned the footbath on
the main floor of Tucker Hall. Not
that it's been put on the approved
list of the Board of Health or any-
thing, but at least the Student Bar
Association or some other authority
has seen fit to remove the toilet seat
with the skull and crossbones from
it. Every litter bit helps.

I might also note that the self-
analysis boys have demurred to
Staff Keekin’s picture of a 4'' cob-
web dismissing it as so much rub-
bish. Actually, the picture submitted
was found to be an old biack-out
curtain installed by the law wives
during the War and apparently left
up by janitorial neglect when the
others were removed so that they
might be used to buff the floor wax
back in "46. (They are now in the
process of counting annual rings to
determine which ‘46.)

Self-Analysis

Speaking of seli-analysis, the stu-
dent version of some lead the science
department to an important discov-
ery. It has been given a Ford Foun-
dation grant to extract anti-jungle-
rot serum from the rats which have
been eating the mold off the books
in the basement. The department
would have liked to have ebtained
the moldy books too, but wasn't able

to do so. Not that the books are
valuable, but George “Somebody
stole my bed" Fisher, a budding

Property I genius, holds the mineral
rights to the English Reports

The science department has given
up hope of expanding its operation
to the main floor of the library. It
finds that if leaves ean come through
the screened windows, other im-
purties, like dust fer a starter, might
also make their way in amongst the
books. The disappointment, however,
is tempered with the hope that the
fauna in the hall drinking fountain
may be eulturable in test tubes

Cherry Smash

 

Robin Dyer, who, in defining

Littered By Drink Bottles

“Cherry Smash,” scored a 1.25 on
a Torts quiz for confusing a form
of assault with a pie sold by the
SBA and commonly used as a book
marker, since discovered that a re-
cent birthday address omitted an-
other similarity between student life
at present and that in 1866. While
working on a Robert E. Lee Re-
search grant, he discovered a note
saying, “If you can’t clean and de-
orderize the Men's Room, put in a
bigger fan. R.E.L.”

Students of cybernetics will be
glad to learn that the Law School
has now amassed quite a collection
of bottles. These have been banded
with numbers in an effort to trace
their travels, a system to study the
migration of ducks and other quack -
ers. At blast-off (11:00 p.m. Wednes-
day) ground zero conditions were:
SBA Room, Empty cases—14; Emp-
ties in cases—64; Empties loose—10;
Garbage Cans—1l; empty Doughnut
Boxes—10.

Basement Hail (only): Empty cas-
es—17; Empties in cases—682; Emp-
ties loose—10; Garbage Cans—4;
empty Doughnut boxes—4, (There
is no overlap in the above fallout
stats.)

As a tribute to how well our new
“No Food in the Library Areas”
campaign is going, only 4 bottles
were in the main library at 11:00
p.m., and those were mostly being
used as ash trays. There is also a
nete on the SBA doorway on a
“KEEP IT CLEAN” sign. “Our Mot-
to; Get the food out but keep the
dirt in.” On the wall inside: Credit

should react against the glass frag-

that just happen to be floating in

action for injuries incurred while

Faculty Votes
Students Money
In These Times

By BRUCE W. RIDER
Times do, as they say, change.
Witness the dear faculty’s with-

. drawal of funds from the Southern
*| Collegian. It all looks like the faculty

is big and bad as well as rough and
tough and we little students had
better toe the line or the faculty
will kick us once again in the back-
side.

Times, as we mentioned above, do
change.

Once upon a time, when univer-
sities were getting their start in a
place called Europe, matters stood
a little differently. People in these
universities had a much different
idea as regards education and stu-
dents and faculty—and especially as
regards money.

‘Way back then, believe it or not,
the university was controlled by the
students. The faculty members were
paid directly by the students. At
the end of a class the young men
would plunk down their money—if
they thought they had learned some-
thing. If not, the professor starved.
Or began to teach a little better a
whole lot faster.

And even earlier in history much
the same was the case. A student or
students would pay a man to teach
them what he knew. These teachers
went from place to place, and they
had to have something going for
them or pretty soon they went back
to growing grapes.

But as the years went by, the
process of education began to be
more structured and _institutional-
ized and the faculty began to run
things and the students’ money be-
gan to be handled by some inter-
mediary and faculty people began
to be paid on a regular (and im-
personal) basis. Which is all well
and good.

But here we are in the year of our
Lord 1966 and we have a faculty vot-
ing students’ money around. Times
appear to have changed.

Very few of us seem to remember
that the students are paying the
teachers to work for them. If any-
body starts to withhold money, a
good place to start might be with the
students, whose money it is.

Back in the olden days a man who
didn’t give you his money’s worth
didn’t get your money.

I wonder what would happen if we
did get back to that old idea that the
university is for the student (not
the faculty or the alumni or who-
ever else.)

And I wonder what would happen
if we withheld our money (‘tuition’
as it’s called today) when we didn’t
like what the faculty or the college
administration was doing. Say in
terms of integration, or education or
both. Or more.

But times have changed, haven't
they, kiddies.

And the faculty votes money about

W&L Plays Yale Tomorrow;
Heads North On Weekend

Washington and Lee University’s lacrosse Generals minus
their one-two scoring leaders and first two goalies of last year

will open a 10-game schedule
experienced 45-man squad.

here tomorrow, hosting Yale’s

It will be only the second meeting between the two schools
ever, the first played in Lexington back in 1948 with the Gen-

erals taking a 7-3
Elis.

But Yale, braced with 16 letter-
men and 18 seniors, should have the
edge today, as should the rest of
W&L’s forthcoming opponents, since
the Generals will field a relatively
young and inexperienced club. Alto-
gether, W&L can count only three
seniors and 10 lettermen on its roster

Perhaps the weakest W&L position
will be attack, where graduated at-
tackmen Carroll Klingelhofer and
Mike Michaeles, the Generals’ scor-
ing leaders in 1965 with a combined
43 goals and assists, have left
their jobs to sophomore Chip Chew
and freshman Joe Wich. Sophomore
Tom Pittman will return at crease to

97
of

give the Generals some experience
there, but additional attack help
must come from three untested

freshmen.

Goal will be another major prob-
lem created by graduation losses.
Sophomore Dave Johnson, who saw
limited action last season behind
seniors Butch West and Frank Mor-
gan, now has the job to himself,
although second-year-man Jim
Dawson could provide some able
reserve strength. Johnson turned in
seven saves in four games last year.

Midfield and defense are somewhat
stronger in number of lettermen and
over-all personnel. Senior letter
winners Billy Andrews, Bruce Jack-
son, and Jay Bowersox lead the mid-
fielders, while juniors Lance Ben-
dann, Warren Stewart, and Ben
Gambill are the most capable W&L
defenders.

The latter trio each have

All-American and unanimous All-

The Generals will play six of

War Discussed
By Philosopher
Last Tuesday

George Lear, philosopher and ac-
tivist, addressed 50 members of the
faculty and student body last Tues-
day on the “Problem of War.”

Mr. Lear, who received his B.A. at
Amherst in Philosophy, his M.A. in
Philosophy at Cornell and is present-
ly writing his doctoral thesis,
on a set of personal values which
is adopted, would make war impos-
sible for Man.

Man is caught in the conflict of
two sets of competing values. The
first, Pacific desire, is the general
desire not to kill or participate in
killing (therefore war) in any way.
The basis of this desire is inherent
in man and is derived from the real-
ization that each man is human and
should be treated as human.

The other desire, social desire,
is directly opposed to the first. This
desire evolves from the desire to
conform to society—to be an ac-
cepted part of the group.

Each individual, through self-gov-
ernment, must choose which desire
will predominate. According to Mr.
Lear, only the choice of the first
desire will truly satiate his questions.
After the choice is made, the indi-
vidual should devote his actions
toward peace-making, in short, fol-
low Gandhi who is the model of the
almost perfect pacifist.

The Best Sports News On Campus

By MIKE NATION

This is the last transitory week
from winter to spring sports. This
is the last week that almost nothing
newsworthy happens. The week af-
ter vacation the indoor sports par-
ticipants start their outdoor season
in earnest up Liberty Hall direction
and out Goshen way.

The search for news at Doremus
turned up nothing except people out
of town. Coach Mac and Coach
Leslie are in Atlantic City at some
sort of football convention. Coach
Eastman is somewhere else.

The Rumor’s True

The rumor circulating that W&L
has accepted a 243 pounder in the
class of 1970 has been confirmed by
Dean Farrar. His name is Crigler
of Randolph-Macon Academy. He
plays football and wrestles heavy-
weight, which should go down as
one of the more astute observations
of the day.

Tennis Rebuilding

The tennis team under Coach
Canfield faces a major rebuilding
this year. Everyone is gone from last
year’s varsity except number three
man Forrest Dickinson and number
six man Phil Thompson. Gone are
top four year men like Jim (Gover-
nor) DeYoung and Randy Jones.

The team has only
courts for a little over a week, the
black top courts as well, for the
others are being repaired. It’s too
early to tell who’s going to be play-
ing in what position.

On the other hand Canfield said
this never will be permanently de-
cided. He considers this good for he
feels that the strong competition for
the berth on the team will make
for better tennis all around.

Besides Thompson and Dickinson,
who will serve this year as captain,
Canfield cited freshman Tom Rueger
and Don McClure, and sophomores
Wick Vellines and Jones Beenes, up
from last year’s freshman squad, as
early outstanding performers.

Rough Schedule

The coach indicated that W&L
would be taking on this year a truly
big time schedule. The team is slat-
ed to meet the likes of West Vir-

been on the

Canfield stated that the attempt is
in the direction of creating one of
the better tennis program in the
state.

Washington and Lee opens its sea-
son on April 5, against Grove City,

Freshman Lacrosse Coach

In keeping with the practice of
past few years, a one time under-
grad who is now a law student will
coach freshman lacrosse. Carroll
Klingelhofer, last year’s stand out
attack man, has been assigned the
task of leading this year’s Brigadiers,
a large portion of which have never
as much as laid eyes on a stick.

Last year Klingie, as one of the
tri-captains, led the team in scoring
and in assists. He scored 26 goals
himself and aided on 25 others. All-

division honors were his for two
years running.
Klingie’s inexperienced stickmen

get their first test April 8, against
Augusta Military Academy on Wil-
son field.

A Tradition Falls

Another fine old Washington and
Lee tradition goes down the drain
this spring vacation. Baseball coach
Joe Lyles has called off the annual
spring vacation march through the
Carolinas for the baseball team.
As Lyles explains elsewhere on this
page, he hopes that this deletion
from the schedule will attract those
boys who prefer Nassau to South
Carolina army bases to give base-
ball a whirl.

 

 

Baseball Team Practices;
Spring Outing Is No More

Baseball coach Joe Lyles is ex-
perimenting this year in an attempt
to build up W&L’s baseball fortunes.
The varsity is not making their usual
Spring trip this year.

Coach Lyles explained his idea
this way. “I hope that by cancelling
the trip over vacation we would
have better and more boys try out
for the squad. In previous years
there have been many boys who did
not play because they had other
plans for their Spring break.

I don’t know yet how well this
idea will work out,” continued
Lyles,” we will have to wait until
the season gets started. The handi-
cap in not having the trip is that
we loose a full week of training. We
are ready to play right now, but af-
ter next week’s layoff I’m not sure
how we will do.”

Two Days to Get Ready

The varsity will have only two
days to prepare a game with Bridge-
water, here, on Wednesday after va-
cation. On the eighth the squad plays
at Old Dominion. Both of these teams
will have practice during the Spring
break.

“Whether the boys will be ready
depends on their maturity,” stated
Lyles. “By maturity I mean, are the
boys able to handle the pressure of

varsity competition? We have fresh-
men on the squad and much will
depend on whether they can men-
tally handle starting roles.”

To lead the freshman coach Lyles
has nine upperclass lettermen, They
are: infilders. Ed Bishop, Fred Cros-
land, Eric Sisler, and Dave Kirpat-
rick; catchers, Skip Jacobsen, and
Guy Townley; and pitchers, Pete
Hueman, Jim Cooper, and Bill Ras-
mussen.

Defense

“These boys and the freshmen will
have to play good defense if we
are to win. I want to make all the
automatic outs. That is we can’t af-
ford errors on the easy grounders
and pop flies. In the past we have
been weak defensively but I want
to develop a balance between good
defense and good offense,” explained
Lyles.

Coach Lyles believes his catchers
will help a group of young pitchers
develop. “We have the best catchers
I've seen in seven years. Besides
Jasobsen and Townley, we have
freshmen catchers John Wolf and
Ed Mitchell.

EC Restores Fining Power
For Assimilation Committee

Fining power was returned to the
Assimilation Committee as a means
of enforcing conventional dress and
dates were announced for the spring
elections by the Executive Commit-
tee in an extended meeting Tuesday
evening. The EC has not as yet de-
cided when the new Assimilation
policy will go into effect, and has di-
rected the present Committee to
continue until further notice with
the same procedures it has followed
this year.

The move toward active enforce-
ment of the dress tradition came af-
ter a motion, by junior representa-
tive Bill Jeffress, to maintain the
committee without enforcement
powers, failed by a 6-4 vote.

Jeffress Motion Fails

Jeffress’ suggestion would have
eliminated the “reporting” system
for violations, but would have em-
powered the Assimilation Committee
to bring before it any freshman on a
first offense or constant upperclass
violators “for the purpose of secur-
ing his cooperation in maintaining
the traditions of speaking and con-
ventional dress.” In the proposal, the
Assimilation Committee could not
have referred violators to the EC.

After this failed, proponents of
enforcement of the tradition

Springs President Mike Saunders
and Dance Board Vice-President
Tommy Cox have announced that
the Marvelettes and “Smokey” Rob-
ingon and the Miracles will perform
at the Dance Set’s Friday evening
concert, April 15.

Both groups represent one of the
most “popular” of popular-music
sounds, Detroit’s Motown. Their ap-
pearance on Springs Weekend will
be the first for each at W&L. To-
gether, they bring a combination of
success and talent which is consid-
ered to be unprecedented here for a
single concert.

he Marvelettes began their career
with Motown in 1962, and since then
have been at the top of the charts

consistently. Their million-sellers
include “Playboy,” “Please, Mr.
Postman,” “Beechwood 4-5789,” and,

most recently, “Don’t Mess With
Bill.” Their albums, all on Hamala
Records, are “Playboy,” “Marvel-
ous,” “Please, Mr. Postman,” “Smash
Hits of ’62,” and “The Marvelettes’
Greatest Hits,” released this past
February and including all four of
their biggest singles.

Their appearances at other col-
leges have brought unanimous ac-
claim: “The Marvelettes take words
and music and balance them in a de-
lightful and pleasing manner...;”
“They and the Supremes are per-
haps the only rock singers who can
please any type audience, from the
transistor-radio-at-the-beach set to
the sophisticated, expense-account
patrons of the night club circuit.”

Bill “Smokey” Robinson, as well
as being lead vocalist with the Mira-
cles, is a prominent composer and
lyricist, having written such songs
as “My Girl” and “The Way You
Do The Things You Do.” When he
appears with the Miracles, in the
words of Motown President Barry
Gordy, Jr., the result is a combin-
ation of “the unique natural gift of

The political forum will be held in
the back room of the College Inn
every Monday night at 8:00, starting
on the second Monday after spring
vacation, While sponsored by the
W&L Young Democrats Club, all
interested persons are urged to at-
tend. There will be no entrance or
membership charges, and those who
attend will be expected to pay for
nothing except their own beer.

The forum will present definite
political topics for open discussion
and will bring in speakers and dis-
cussion leaders. The first subject for
discussion will be “The Politics of
Protest.” A planning committee is
being formed by the Young Demo-
crats to decide on future topics,
some of which may be: the admis-
sion of Red China to the U.N., Am-
erican diplomacy in developing na-
tions, Viet-nam, the dilemma of the
Democrat in the South, and the civ-
il rights movement teday

On April 18 or 19, the W&L Young
Democrats Club will join with the
Randolph-Macon club to bring Mr
Sargent Reynolds to the forum as a
speaker. Reynolds is
ed member of the Virginia House of
Delegates who is considered one of

Minin Critic
Denies Freud’s

Rex Complex

At the Fifty-Fourth Washington
and Lee Seminar in Literature, Mr.
Francis Fergusson, professor of
comparative literature at Rutgers
University, presented a lecture en-
titled “Oedipus According to Sopho-
cles, Cocteau, and Freud.”

The lecture in duPont Auditor-
ium at 8:15 p.m. March 22, dealt
with Sophocles’ King Oecdipus,
Freud’s modern concept of the Oedi-
pus complex, and Cocteau’s play The
Infernal Machine.

Mr. Fergusson indicated that the
original Oedipus in Sophocles was
merely a man who was destined by
the gods to kill his father and mar-
ry his mother. Oedipus tries desper-
ately to find the truth of the whole
situation and when he finds that he
has followed the prophecy, he takes
his punishment as a hero. There is
nothing “hidden or suppressed” in
the play to indicate a psychological
nature such as the Freudian Oedi-
pus complex.

According to Mr. Fergusson, to-
day’s people tend to think of Oedi-
pus in terms of Freud's complex, but
the more intensive reader can see
in the story that Oedipus is control-
led by circumstances. He does not
realize that Jocasta is his mother
and as a matter of fact, ran from his
home so that the prophecy would
not come true.

Freudian ideas come from actual
cases. When reading the play, one
can see, in some respects, a parallel
to Freudian analysis. First Oedipus
is confused. He feels threatened but
realizes that he must uncover the
facts concerning the death of the
King of Thebes. He starts with the
easily accepted facts and gradually

Two Youths Jailed Fined
For Attacks On Students

Two Rockbridge County youths
have been sentenced and fined as the
result of charges brought against
them to the Lexington Municipal
Court by three W&L students and a
local merchant.

Wayne Lee Carter, 20, of Buena
Vista, and Gerald Allen Rhodes, 18,
of Glasgow, were brought before
Judge William A. Romans last Tues-
dal, March 22.

Carter, found guilty on two
charges of assault and battery and
three charges of cursing and abus-
ing, was fined a total of $355 and
sentenced to a six-month jail term.

Rhodes was found guilty on one
charge of destroying property and
two charges of assault and battery.
He was sentenced to 120 days in
jail—although the sentence was sus-
pended—and fined $130 and court
costs.

NOTICE

Dean William W. Pusey, II], has
announced that the speaker for
W&L's Phi Beta Kappa-Cincinnati
Day Convocation, April 12, will be

The incidents from which the
charges arose began about 6 p.m.
on Wednesday, Feb. 15, when the
two men attacked sophomore Mike
Spector outside the B&F Lunch and
attempted to seize his umbrella.

They fled after an exchange of
blows.
Shortly afterwards, Carter and

Rhodes met freshman Danny Woods
in front of Adair-Hutton and chased
him to the Old Dormitory after tak-
ing his hat.

The two entered the pool hall on
West Nelson Street, where they be-
gan abusing proprietor Adolphus
Davis after tearing the telephone out
of the wall so that he could not call
police. The final victim of the at-
tackers was Bob Brenner, who had
his glasses taken and was struck
four or five times. After this inci-
dent, which occurred in the Metho-
dist Church parking lot, Brenner ran
to the SPE house and called police,
who finally arrested Carter and
Rhodes in George's Tap Room.

Commenting on the outcome of

the trial, University Proctor Bob
Murray said that the sentences
handed down to Rhodes and Carter
would “make people think twice”

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Friday Edition

Generous Decision

The Ring-tum Phi thanks President Cole for his prudent
and generous decision to return the Southern Collegian con-
troversy to the Student Affairs Committee.

 

It is our hope that this action will ameliorate the insulted
parties representing both views and allow adequate investiga-
tion and debate of the Collegian issue.

Love

During the past few weeks there has been a great deal of
controversy about Conventional Dress and in a larger sense
about the traditions upon which this university was established.
The pleas by members of the student body either in support of
or against the established code of deportment have failed to
recognize the major issue involved.

The major issue involved in this dilemma is love. This word
is not intended to have any romantic connotations but rather
it is to convey a spirit which the members of the University
feel towards themselves and towards the University. This spirit
of love is not present at W&L and for this reason the tradi-
tions are generally being eliminated.

Some people believe that subsidized athletics would re-
store this love of the University. This, however, is not neces-
sary. Alumni, who attended W&L after subsidized athletics
were abolished, have impressed me with their strong love of
the University. One alumnus in particular stated that he would
not consider sending his son to any school other than W&L.

This attitude certainly does not exist now. At the present
time indifference is the prevailing attitude. It is considered
studly to remain aloof and for this very reason the traditions
are decaying.

This situation is not hopeless. There are solutions to this
problem but the solutions will not be easily accomplished. It
will take a concerted effort by the members of the student body
who have a sincere love of the University to instill this spirit
in the other members of the student body.

There are four sources which can be used to restore this
former attitude. These sources are: the fraternities, the student
leaders, the faculty, and the individual students themselves.

Since this school is fraternity oriented, the fraternity can
play an important role in the restoration of a positive atmos-
phere within the University. The purpose of the fraternity is
to instill its members with the desire of excel. The fraternities
at W&L for the most part have failed to fulfill their responsi-
bility. This deficiency can be overcome if the leaders of the fra-
ternity activity encourage the members to participate in the ac-
tivities of the fraternity and the activities of the University.
With all the members working for the betterment of the fra-
ternity and in a sense the betterment of the University a large
step can be realized toward a better spirit among the students.

The student leaders should set an example which the other
students want to follow. They can do this through enthusiasm.
(Enthusiasm in this sense is not to be confused with fanati-
cism.) If the leaders of the campus enthusiastically support this
University, other students are going to want to follow their
example.

The faculty can help bring the students together by en-
couraging the students to get in contact with them. Personal
relationships between the students and the faculty can make
the educational experience richer for both the faculty and the
students.

Finally each student has a responsibility to himself and to
the University. He represents a university which was founded
on high ideals, ideals which will hold a man in high esteem
wherever he may go. It is his duty to preserve and cherish the
ideals which he is fortunate to be able to represent.

If these approaches can be carried through, the difficulties
which we have encountered will be removed. We realize that

 

these changes will not come immediately. All we ask is that
everyone takes it upon himself to try to correct the situation.
If everyone does, W&L will again become an institution which

S.P.M,

everyone will love and be proud to represent.

Editor’s Note: This story is part
of a series of features designed to
locate What W&L Lacks The Most.

By STEVE MILLARD

“A ten-point, long-range program
embracing faculty, students and cur-
ricular changes and designed to
make Washington and Lee eventu-
ally ‘the  out-
standing teaching
institution in the
country’ was ex-
plained today...
following a
Thursday _ after-
noon presentation
to faculty mem-
bers.”

My eyes can be
somewhat less
than reliable at
times, so I looked
again. Yes, there is was, still staring
me in the face—a front-page article
in the Ring-tum Phi, heralding a
series of revolutionary changes at
staid old W&L. I leaned back for a
moment and let my imagination en-
joy itself. “This is today’s paper,” I
told myself contentedly, “and good
things are in store for The House
That Lee Built.” Then my sense of
the ridiculous belched in protest, and
I took a second, sobering look at the
date: November 25, 1947.

Reform Zeal—1947
Nineteen years. A whole truckload

world’s longest concrete
pension footbridge in far less time.
As a matter of fact, it must be down
there; nobody seems quite able to
locate it anywhere else. And, no mat-
ter how foreign the thought may
seem, we need it in the worst pos-
sible way.

But now, out of the dim back-
ground, we hear a chorus of angry
voices—or are they just bored?
“Stop tearing everything down and
look at the good.” “This school
draws its strength from tradition,
not wild reform.” “Straighten your
tie, mister.” Truly, the philosophers
rule.

It takes no unusual effort to fall
into the prevailing pattern of exis-
tence. It takes no particular spark to
be satisfied with a measure of “good”
and to ignore a host of nagging de-
ficiencies. It does take something a
bit out of the ordinary to place an
individual or an institution among
those “sublimely cursed by discon-
tent.” The chorus of indignant self-
satisfaction which greets every pro-
posed fluctuation of the status quo
has little in common with this “ten-
point, long-range program.” Among
its then-radical proposals, by the
way, we find the senior thesis, com-
prehensive examination, and inde-
pendent major, Today, we respect
these programs as integral parts of
the curriculum; it should be borne
in mind that their origins cannot be
traced to the custodians of Things

As They Are.
Curse of Reform—Here?

Imagine for a moment that the
curse of reform fell upon Washing-
ton and Lee. How would these sub-
versive minds work? What guiding
principles would’ direct their
thoughts and produce their recom-
mendations?

Above all else, the chances are
that such agents of doom would tend
to be generalists. Their primary con-
cern would be with the proper goals
of a university and the extent to
which Washington and Lee realizes
these goals. As a further considera-
tion, they would have to examine
such characteristics as size and loca-
tion, since these determine the spe-
cific way in which the larger aims
ean best be fulfilled

If all this appears hopelessly self-
evident, stop and ask yourself how
often it actually oceurs. Think back
the endless discussions, sup-
cosmic but

upon
posedly in
pheral in reality, which masquerade
as meaningful analysis. Then tackle
a really difficult task into a
new role and play the game by these

intent peri-

slep

; i
open and freewheeling rules

What follows is my own excursion

 

 

 

into this untraveled area. The spe-
cifle answers are there for consid-
eration, but are themselves ix im-
portant than the approach It asks
that you dispense with the idea that
any particular tradition or “image”
eonnected with Washington and Lee
is essential to its best rest lt

by their relation to the preper and
necessary goals of this or any other

of reforming zeal can go under the |
non-sus- |

 

ed to one idea: a university exists
to develop excellence of mind. This
involves the transmission of atti-
tudes as well as facts, the develop-
ment of wisdom beyond knowledge.
It does not involve the extra-curri-
cular idea of a “gentleman”; except
for the gentlemanly outlook which
ought ideally to develop as a conse-
quence of liberal education, this
concern has no proper place among
the goals of a university. We often
hear reference made to the state-
ment of Robert E. Lee: “We have
but one rule here—our students are
gentlemen.” The General would
probably storm out of his grave if
he knew that this valid and flexible
rule had been subtly transformed
into a university goal,

Now Let’s Measure W&L
We now have a yardstick with
which to measure a multitude of
sins. As an example, let’s apply this
goal to that most explosive of con-

 

temporary issues, the conventional
dress question. When Mr. Awad at-

tempted similar larceny in a recent
column, the effect was remarkable;
apparently the thought was so ob-
vious that it had eluded everyone

else.

Viewed in this perspective, the
entire debate assumes a sadly mean-
ingless character. One side attempts
to find a correlation between the
clothes on my back and the thoughts
in my head—an endeavor which
speaks none too well for somebody’s
conception of the mind. Another side
insists that the tradition is dying
and asks that we recognize the fact—
a valid enough contention, but one
which sidesteps the main point.

The truth is that a prolonged de-
bate over How We Shall Dress, to
the exclusion of everything else con-
nected with the University, is noth-
ing short of asinine. Admittedly, it’s
a sad necessity if new paths are to
be followed; nevertheless, the ad-
vocate of change must eventually
confront the absurdity of this per-
petual symposium.

 

Ponder Your Right To Destroy .. .
Assert Your Right To Grow, Build

But now the chorus returns,
bringing still another pet argument.
“Do you see mature, successful
businessmen wearing sweatshirts?
You have to make your way in the
world, and college is your prepara-
tion. This silly association of sweat-
shirts with intellectuality is thought-
less and immature. Grow up.”

Clothes and Intellectuality
This is surely the unkindest cut
of all. In the first place, there is no
association intended between any
clothing and intellectuality. There
is also a more fundamental question
suggested by this argument—the
curious and widespread concept of
college and its opportunities as in
some final sense a business venture.
True, we all need the diplomas.
True, we pay for a service. Now go
back to our statement of the prim-
ary goal here: to develop excellence
of mind, That, brethren, is no busi-
ness venture. It’s more like a cos-
mic game. We spend a large por-

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

(Editor's note: This is the fourth
in a series of articles on countries
visited during the recent voyage of
the research vessel “Vema.”)

American citizens who live and
work in the Panama Canal Zone are
often criticized at home and some-
times attacked in
Panama for main-
taining their Am-
recian way of life,
to the exclusion of
Panamanian civi-
lization and Pan-
amanians them-
selves. On first

however, one can

The Republic of Panama is a crea-

or to this columnist.

Should sufficient interest in the
subject be shown, the Friday Sports
Staff will consider duplicating its
recent highly successful Trivia Con-

Stickmen Lose Two;
Coach Lauds Efforts

By RON KESSLER

Washington and Lee’s inexperi-
enced lacrosse team lost its second
game of the season Wednesday to
Yale University, 14-6. The Yale
squad was unquestionably stronger
and more experienced, sporting 16
lettermen and 18 seniors to W&L’s
10 lettermen and three seniors.

The Generals played a much
stronger game then they did Mon-
day against Swarthmore, losing 7-4.
According to Head Coach Dana
Swan, the team “improved in many
areas. We scored six against a much
better team.”

The first quarter went relatively
well for W&L. The squad played a
good defense, and tied the score at
2-2 on goals by senior Jay Bower-
sox and Hugh Baugher, with four
minutes left to play. Yale jumped
ahead in the last minute of the
quarter on a goal gy All-American
Bradford. The second quarter was

in Yale action dominated entirely by Yale, scoring
x five goals, three in the first two min-

In the third period the Generals
seemed to settle down and regroup
their forces. Senior Bruce Jackson,
in a tremendous effort, dug in and
scored two goals in as many min-
utes. The Yale team then seemed to
find itself again, and finished off the
quarter with three more, holding
W&L scoreless for the remaining 13
minutes.

Jackson scored his third goal in
the opening minutes of the fourth
quarter and was quickly followed by

play. Yale re-awoke, and finished off
the game scoring three goals, the
last one the fourth of the game by
Cobridge.

On W&L’s side, Bruce Jackson
dominated the game, scoring three
goals in five attempts. Tom Pittman
put forth a good effort, screening
several outside shots, and goalie
Dave Johnson played an excellent
game, making 17 saves.

Co-captain Lance Bendann did a
fine job on defense, keeping Yale’s
Bradford from exploding. Freshmen
Clint Murchison, Bart Goodwin, and
Joe Wich played ample games and
showed promise for the future.

Statistically speaking, Yale shot
14 for 47 while Washington and Lee
went 6 for 24. Yale picked up 35
ground balls, W&L 21. In the Gen-
erals’ weakest statistic, Yale went
2 for 9 in extra man opportunities,
while W&L was 0 for 5.

Commenting on the game, Coach
Swan stated, “We were disappointed
at the margin of the score. I didn’t
feel that it was a 14-6 ballgame as
far as the difference between the
two teams went. Our largest problem
was in extra man opportunities; our
clearing also was inconsistent. When
Yale started scoring in that third
quarter, our inexperience gave us

tion of our four years here tackling
subjects of precious little “practi-
cal” significance, in the pursuit of
something just a bit finer. The spirit
of this endeavor, in the words of
Richard Hofstader, “a spirit of ‘play-
fulness’—~a sense Of sheer delight in
activity of the mind.”
Appropriateness Forgotten

In case anyone has forgotten the
fact, clothes vary in accordance with
their appropriateness. We accept the
businessman’s suit as appropriate to
his function, and the manual labor-
ers outfit for the same reason. In
the game of education, I defy anyone
to tell me what is universally func-
tional. I would also request that the
tradition-oriented resist the tempta-
tion to inform me that coats and
ties are functional here because we
accept them. Obviously, an increas-
ing minority does not accept them;
conceivably, the group may even
have perfectly good reasons.

In any the insistence upon
one form of dress or another is a
useless distraction from the real con-
cerns of this university. Therefore,
I would simply offer the revolution-
ary proposal that classroom wear be
dictated by whatever happens to be
comfortable. Beyond that, it just
doesn’t matter.

Now the chorus of voices sounds
more weary than ever. “Will you go
away?” “This place just doesn't need
that kind of change.” “Good God,
a respected university.”

It is indeed. And it will most as-
uredly not continue to be respect-
ed, if we cling to traditions and ed-
ucational practices which have
ceased to be productive and mean-
ingful. The ideals which unite a
University are not based on out-
moded myths, but on working reali-

Americans cannot reasonably be ex-
pected to abandon their habitual
way of life for the squalid, degrad-
ing conditions of the Republic.

While aware of the social prob-
lems in Panama, the Vema scien-
tists found it almost impossible to
keep from being “ugly Americans.”
We found that in simply wearing
casual street clothes, carrying tour-

t cameras, and making modest ex-
penditures, were displaying os-
tentatious wealth by Panamanian
tandards.

There is, of course, no ready solu-
tion to the Panamanian resentment
for the Canal Zone and for Ameri-
cans. The canal cannot feasibly be
staffed by some self-sacrificing or-
ganization as the Peace Corps, and
American technicians would leave
if they and their families were made
to live like Panamanians. My im-
pression is that only by raising the
economic, social, and political stand-
ards of Panama can a real accord

ties. We appear to stand at a cross-
roads, where the old is losing its
eharm and the new has yet begun to
assert itself. In the transitional void,
too many students seem to share the
opinion of one highly intelligent and
highly disillusioned sophomore:

“Some schools are so bad that you
never know what you're missing.
Some are so good that you can really
have an_ intellectual experience.
W&L is right in the middle; it’s
just good enough to make you real-
ize what you've missed.”

Needed: A Reforming Spirit

If ever we neded a reforming spir-
it, the time is now. We need to ap-
ply all phases of university life to
the goals dismissed earlier—not in
an isolated “self-study” program,
but in an entirely different approach
to university life. Mr. Ruffin is right
when he lists the role of “innovator”
as a logical one for schools such
as ours; beyond that, however, it is
a crucial role for this school, right
now.

Let’s cite a final example. When-
ever the “integration question” aris-
es, we hear that W&L will welcome
a qualified Negro, but that we should
wait for one who applies because
he honestly feels a “compatibility”
between his goals and the W&L ex-
perience.

I disagree heartily. We should ac-
tively seek this qualified Negre. If
we can dig up a qualified Saudi
Arabian along the way, fine. A truly
diversified student body is an intel-
lectual experience in _ itself—one
which we can and should seek to
develop.

This is the approach we need and
lack. Place yourself under the guid-
ance of our natural and necessary
goals. Play the role of reformer and
see what happens. I repeat what was
said earlier; my answers are there
for consideration, but the method
is indispensable. “Ponder your right
to destroy and maim...” and then
assert your right to build and grow.

the details of an experience where
he killed a man return and he real-
izes, with the aid of witnesses, that
he fulfilled the old prophacy.

Cocteau’s The Infernal Machine
was described as more Freud-like
than the Sophocles play. In it, Oedi-
pus and Jocasta are on the verge of
discovering the truth, but tell each
other lies so that they will not real-
ize they are parent and child.

In his closing comment, Mr. Fer-
gusson stated, “Freud and what he
thinks can never take the place of
the play. We need to re-capture the
old tradition presented in the play
by Sophocles.”

Opposed by President

President Fred Mindel opposed
this measure, but had no vote in the
matter, as he may only break ties.
“In addition the system has worked
very well this year,’ Mindel com-
mented.

The members who agreed with
Mindel throughout the voting were
Bob Lee, Mike Hash, and Bill Jeff-
ress. Kirk Follo voted against the
motion to strengthen the Assimila-
tion Committee, but voted for the
schedule of fines because he felt “it
was the best system of enforcement
we can work out—if we have got
to enforce the tradition.” Sophomore
representative Richard Nash voted
in favor of the motion to strengthen

It was still an improvement over the
Swarthmore game—then we only
played coherent lacrosse for eight
minutes; against Yale we played co-

and did the best that they could.
They've got to bring up their men-

was pleasantly surprised with a lot
that I saw; the boys do well what

the Committee, but opposed the spe-
cific motion on fines. Dave Marchese,
Sam Hinkle, Al Byrne, Jerry Turn-
er, and Joe Framptom were the
members of the bloc who desired
enforcement.

The Committee encountered less
disagreement when it turned to set-
ting the dates for spring elections.
Unanimously, the members voted
the following calendar for the Big
Four election: President, Vice-Pres-
ident, Secretary and President of
Fancy Dress.

Election Dates

On Monday, April 11, each candi-
date must submit a petition with
150 signatures to Joe Framptom by
6:00 p.m. On Tuesday, April 12, there
will be an open meeting of the stud-
ent body to allow candidates to
briefly state their views. On Wed-
nesday, April 13, primary elections
will be held to reduce the number of
finalists for each office to two. No
primary will be held if no more than
two men have filed for an office. On
Monday, April 18, the general elec-
tion will be held.

The system for Class officers and
EC representatives is similar to the
Big Four elections on Monday, April
25, petitions with 50 signatures are
due to Joe Framptom by 6:00 p.m.
On Wednesday, April 27, the prim-
ary will be held, and on Monday
May 2, the general election will take
place. Law school elections will
be held entirely on ‘the night of
May 2.

AND UNIVERSALISTS?

Unitarians and Universalists be-

constructively more important than
the accepting of religious creeds.

Unitarians and Universalists are
convinced that religious truth can-
not be contrary to truth from any
other source.

Unitarians and Universalists offer
a religious program for children and
adults of all cultures, with reason
as our guide, and service as our aim.

They further believe that “the
great end in religious education is
not to stamp our minds irresistably
on the young but to stir up their
own.”

EC Implements
Revised Policy
On Assimilation

By CHRIS MILLS

The Executive Committee voted
at its Tuesday meeting to imple-
ment its new policy of fining vio-
lators of conventional dress “as
soon as possible.” The schedule for
the upcoming Big Four elections was
again discussed, and an open meeting
for the candidates to express their
views before the student body was
slated for Tuesday, April 12, at 7
p.m. (See election story on page one
for complete details.)

In contrast to the disagreement
which plagued the committee when
imposition of fines was approved the
membership agreed unanimously that
no further delay should occur be-
fore the Assimilation Committee
should start to employ its new pow-
ers. Bob Lee, a vociferous opponent
~\of enforcement of the tradition, made
the motion te begin enforcement,
and the committee also voted to eall
the chairman and the two secretaries
of the Assimilation Committee be-
fore the EC next Tuesday for a con-
ference on what will be expected of
the three officers and the other
Committee members.

In voting to implement the sched-
ule of fines this year, the EC ex-
pressed the opinion that if a decision

Springs Weekend president Mike

signing of Chuck Jackson and his
All-Star Revue to perform at the
Saturday concert, April 16, com-
pletes the Springs lineup of enter-

Jackson's appearance this month
is a re-scheduling of his planned
Openings concert in October, which
had to be cancelled when the star
entered a hospital because of tooth
trouble.

As a performer, Chuck Jackson is
considered to be at the “top of the
top” in rhythm-and-blues-and-rock-
and-roll, on a par with Chuck Berry
and James Brown. He has played

at most eastern and nothern col-

Dance Board vice-president Tom-

my Cox has urged all members of |

the junior class to pay their class
dues as soon as possible. If these
are not paid immediately, he said,
the supply of liquor at the cocktail
party may be seriously limited.

Both concerts will begin at 8:10
p.m. Both will be held in Doremus
Gymnasium. According to Dance
Board president Jim Crothers, there
will be no admission to either con-
cert except by Dance Plan or by
advance-sale tickets. Tickets for
non-Dance Plan holders are now on
sales at the Co-op: $8 for non-dance
plan holders and for out-of-town
guests, $5 if purchased by a student
who holds a Dance Plan.

The primary elections for the of-
fices of President, Vice-President,
and Secretary of the Student Body,
plus President of Fancy Dress, will
be held this Wednesday in the first
Big Four election conducted without
political parties in almost twenty
years. Nominations will be made by
petitions of at least 150 signatures,
which must be given to Secretary
Joe Framptom by 6 p.m. on Monday

On Tuesday at 7 p.m., there will
be an open meeting of the student
body in the Commons to allow can-
didates to state their opinions and
intentions. On Wednesday, April 13,
the primary election will be held to
reduce the number of nominees for
each office to two; however, no pri-
mary will be held for offices where
no more than two men have filed
petitions. All four classes of the un-
dergraduate student body and the
law school students are eligible to
vote.

 

The final election for the Big Four
positions will be on Monday, April
18, and presumably the five days be-
tween the primary and the election
will serve for campaigning. The elec-
tion procedure has been greatly
changed from that of previous years,
when no primaries were held and
nominations were made by party
cliques.

Class Elections

The class elections, to be held
later, will be similar in procedure
to the Big Four elections. Class
officers will consist of Vice-Presi-
dent, the offices of class secretary
and class historian having been elim-
inated. The rising-senior class will
elect three vice-presidents, one each

 

E.C. Requests Nominations
For Annual Gilliam Award
For Valuable Contributions

The Executive Committee is seek-
ing letters nominating students for
the Dean Frank A. Gilliam Award.
Any student currently enrolled in
the University is eligible for the
award and nominations may be made
by students and faculty members.

The recipient of this award must
have made a valuable contribution
to student affairs. This contribution
might take the form of outstanding
work in one field or in numerous
fields. It shall not be necessary that
the recipient have held any partic-
ular office or position, or that his
contribution be made through an
organization.

Nominating letters should be mail-
ed to Box 9, Lexington or given to
Jerry Turner, Bob Lee, or Joe
Framptom. All letters should be in
by Friday, April 15

 

Candidates’ Petitions
Due Monday Night

for commerce, liberal arts, and

sciences,

Nominations for class offices will
also made by petition, 50 signa-
tures being required. Students may
sign more than one petition. Nom-
inating petitions for class officers
must be submitted to Secretary
Frampton before 6 p.m. on Monday,
April 25. A primary will be held on
Wednesday to narrow the field of
candidates to two in the class offices
and three for the Executive Commit-
tee positions, and the general class
elections will be on Monday, May 2.

The law school elections will be
held entirely on the night of May 2,
and will determine the selection of
class officers and two EC represen-
tatives.

Commenting on the new election
establishment, President Fred Min-
del said, “Compared with previous
elections, the new election procedure
is extremely fair and equitable. It
gives any interested student a chance
to run for office, but at the same
time, the primary will reduce the
selection to the two most serious
contenders for each office. For the
first time in years, W&L will have
a major election which is free, open,
and run solely by the students.”

 

Biostratigraphy
Conceptualized

On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednes-
day of next week, Dr. Earle G.
Kauffman of the United States Na-
tional Museum will be at W&lL to
speak as a guest of the Geology De-
Dr.

partment. Kauffman is an as-
sociate curator with the Division of
Invertebrate Paleontology, Smith-

sonian Institution. He is, however, a
research geologist rather than strict-
ly a director of the Museum.

Dr. Kauffman will give three talks,
open to all students and the public.
On Monday afternoon at 2:30 in
Howe 206, he will discuss the “Evo-
lution of Fossil Shellfish.” On Tues-
day at 2:30 pm., he will talk on
“The Living Environments of Fossil
Moliuses,” also in Howe 206.

Finally, on Wednesday morning
at 10:15, Dr. Kaufiman will speak
on “Cretaceous Biostratigraphy,
Paleoecology, and Sedimentary His-
tory of the Southern Rocky Moun-
tains.” At other times, Dr. Kauffman
will be available for discussion with
interested students and professors.

Kauffman's visit to W&L is spon-
sored by the American Geological
Institute's visiting scientists program,
and this is the seventh year that
the program has brought scientists
to W&L. On Thursday, Dr. Kauff-

 

man goes on to William and Mary

Mid-Semester Lamentations

Enormous herds of naked souls I saw,
lamenting till their eyes were burned of tears;
they seemed condemned by an unequal law...

The Inferno, Canto XIV, 13-18

Dante, of course, was referring to the dead in hell. But the
description wouldn’t be a bad one for the average W&L stu-
dent’s reaction to mid-semester grades, which have once more
indicated that among other hallowed traditions at W&L there
is one which states that mid-semester grades of second semester
must be at least one grade point below the grades of any other
period. It’s no surprise that the lament goes up that the stu-
dent body was somewhere, somehow, “condemned by an un-
equal law.”

If ever there was a problem, it’s how to explain away that
unpleasant row of figures unfeelingly stamped by the IBM
on your white “Student’s Copy”—which is the IBM’s way
of letting you know that there are plenty more of these things
floating around for the enjoyment of your parents, friends
and professors. (Furthermore, we have always felt that the
title of the column marked SEMESTER HOURS AT-
TEMPTED is unnecessarily cute, if not downright insulting) .

So, the lamenting turns into shrieks of anguish as the
students discover that the product of six week’s hard labor
has turned out once again to be (shall we say) less than en-
couraging. In vain were all the desperate all-nighters, in vain
the endless lists of possible ID's (“he couldn’t ask that one”),
the cold quizzes, the helpful hints of the College Outline
Series; in vain the frantic infighting for class participation
points. There you are, right back where you were last semster
(or lower), when Dad said that if you didn’t bring up those
grades....

You can’t help but wonder.

It it worth it?

Everybody has heard the stories, (most of them true),
about boys who leave W&L because the academic demands
were so great that they no longer felt they could put up with
them, day in and day out, with nothing to show for it but a
steadily-plunging GPR; and about how they then entered an-
other college, made Dean’s List, and graduated in the upper
tenth of their class. And all the stories say the same: the student
did all this with the same amount of effort that he had put
out unsuccessfully at W&L—the same amount of effort you’re
putting out.

What's more, always lurking in the background is The
Draft. The latest government move has been to issue directives
to all draft boards that they may begin taking students in the
bottom half of the freshman class, the bottom third of the
sophomore class, and the bottom fourth of the junior class,
unless they can score a 70 on the standard test to be given
next month. Dean Atwood assured us that no W&L student
should have any difficulty making a 70 or above on the stand-
ard test. This may be true; however, with the draft boards
casting ever-hungrier eyes on what has been called “the largest
untapped reservoir of manpower in the U.S.,” class standings
can only gain, not lose, in importance. The standard test may
be out of date within two years, and the temptation to draft
boards to use grades as a standard will become greater.

Or supposing that the average W&L student, by means of
heroic efforts, maintains an overall standing sufficient to keep
him in school long enough to graduate. Sooner or later, he'll
enter that inevitable plush office for the inevitable and all-
important first job interview. Competing with him for the same
position will be the graduate of City College—a good school,
but one which doesn’t call for undue academic performances
from its students. He has a B average. The employer calls
our W&L graduate in. (Excuse me, sir, that’s Washington
and Lee, not William and M—yes, I know there’s a high school
by that name in D.C... . No, I went to the university.) Alas,
one glance at his academic record—call it a 1.2—and the
W&L student loses out.

That’s chat. Its not worth it. Right?

Wrong.

Wrong, because when we came here it was not to look for
any A that could be had for the taking. Wrong, because when
we came here it was not to dodge the draft. Wrong, because
when we came here we knew we were coming to a school
whose graduates were not snapped up by big business because
of the letter on their sweater pocket. We came to a school
which demanded much in the way of sacrifice, time, and some-
times self-esteem; which offered little in the way of status,
easy marks, or the promise of a good job and good pay
after graduation. All it offered was an education and a train-
ing that in the end would stand us in better stead than any-
thing City College, for all its advantages, could offer.

And when you think about it, that’s quite a lot.

unusually high caliber of its “big-

But the 1964 spring elections pro-

Formal Parties

Ever since the late 1940’s, nomi-
nations of candidates had been
made by two formal political par-
ties, the University Party and the
Independent Party. However, these
parties were organized as fraternity
groups rather than opinion groups,
and the University Party consisted
of the nine (sometimes ten) largest
fraternity houses. The U.P. invari-
ably won every election, clean-
sweeping several and its candidates
were usually invincible. Party loyal-
ty was maintained on the spurious
contention that non-party voting was
a betrayal of one’s fraternity; as late
as 1962, freshmen were threatened
with black-balling for “disloyal”
talking or voting. Unfortunately
these coercive methods were gener-
ally effective.

But the most obnoxious feature
of pre-1964 campus politics was the
clique nominating system. Party
candidates for office were selected
in secret session by party cliques
consisting of one voting member
from each house in the party. These
cliques were entirely out of control
of the constitutent fraternity mem-
bers and usually selected candidates
on the giving each house
its turn for power and rush week
influence. The nomination of real
leaders was incidental to fraternity
ambition. Furthermore, in many
houses, the clique representative
was not even elected by the members
but appointed by his predecessor.

clique that the gravy train was gone
for good. After some secret bargain-
ing on the eve of Mock Convention,
clique members of ten of the stronger |
houses devised the “Liberty Party,”
dissolving both the University Party
and the Progressive Party.
Disgust and Opposition

Disgust and opposition to the
manipulation of the students and
fraternities by the cliques and cam-
pus bosses had been mounting
steadily during this period of politi-
cal unrest. Now, the cynical and
covert formation of the Liberty Party
as the new “big clique” brought the
opposition to a head, and the day
after the L.P. was announced, Sigma
Chi declared its intention to remain
independent of all parties and
cliques, establishing a precedent.

The sabotaged Progressive Party

But neither party was to survive
an election. Just before the fall
election, a final clique maneuver
placed Beta, KA, Phi Delt, PiKA,
SAE, Phi Gam, SPE, Delt, and Kap-
pa Sig in a new “big clique,” ap-
propriately named “University Par-
ty” after its defunct predecessor.

The remaining nine houses held an
open meeting on the day that the
latest coalition was disclosed and
agreed to eschew any party or clique
organizations, hoping to end clique
rule once and for all by holding free
and open nominations. Nevertheless,
the University Party candidate won
the freshman E.C, election.

In the spring, 1965, a constitutional
amendment which would reform the
party system failed in a student
referendum, and on April 9, the
University Party clique nominated

Improving Stickmen
Fall to Denison, 8-3

By RON KESSLER

Reeking with inexperience and in-
consistency, the Washington and Lee
Lacrosse Team lost its fourth official
game Thursday to Denison Univer-
sity, 8-3.

Although the team as a whole
seemed improved since their last
home game before vacation, Denison
proved to be too strong and too
quick. The Generals were Denison’s
third victim of the week, defeating
University of North Carolina, 11-4,
and Duke, 18-6.

sheet, W&L played a good tight
defense. Goalie Dave Johnson played

Hampden-Sydney Scores
Heavily In Field Events;
General Trackmen Beaten

The W&L track team was defeated
yesterday by the Tigers of Hampden-
Sydney, 74-62 in what proved to
be one of the most hotly contested
meets of the season.

Competing at Farmville, the Gen-
erals took first place honors in seven
of the ten running events but falter-
ed in field competition.

Bill Wildrick, Wes Murfin, and
Moby Dowler swept the 880 yard
run. Bob Stack nabbed first in the
mile while co-captain Jim Thomp-
son triumphed in the 440 yard dash.
In the 220 freshman Pat Howell
seored a victory.

Other first place points were scored
by junior letterman Jeff Kugel in
the 440 yard intermediate hurdles
and by co-captain Lee Johnson, in
the two-mile run. Kugel also gained
second place honors in the high
hurdles. The meet was climaxed by
the success of the mile relay team
composed of Murfin, Wildrick,
Thompson, and Rick Meiser.

In the field events the Generals
placed in the shot-put, second and
third; the discus, third; the triple
jump, third; the pole vault, second
and third; and the broad jump,

Coach Norman Lord’s comments
on the meet were: “If we could have
gotten two more seconds we would
have won the meet. Getting licked
by Hampden-Sydney is going to
make us a better team. It is the first
time they have beaten us since 1959
and I think this will eause the boys
to work harder. With hard work
Il think we ean develop into a win-

ning lt

um.”

a tremendous game, “officially” sav-
ing eleven (although by most counts
it was at least sixteen).

Denison led throughout the game,
scoring one the first quarter and two
the second to W&L’s none. The Gen-
erals finally broke the ice in the
opening minutes of the second half
with goals by Chip Chew and Bruce
Jackson. Denison proceeded to score
four in the third period and one
in the fourth. Chew scored his sec-
ond and W&L’s final goal with 3:36
to play in the game.

Statistic-wise, the Generals looked
better. W&L picked up 36 ground
balls to Denison’s 28. Denison shot
8 for 40, Washington and Lee 3 for
19. In extra man opportunities, W&L
was 1 for 2, Denison 3 for 8. The
Generals scored no goals in five fast

breaks, while Denison scored one
in four.
Coach Dana Swan extolled the

team’s efforts against a better team,
claiming “there was no question
that Denison is better. Considering
that Denison has been either co-
champion or champion of the Mid-
West Conference since it was organ-
ized, I'd say our guys really battled
them. Warren Stewart and Lance
Bendann did fine jobs on defense,
and Dave Johnson performed excel-
lently as goalie. We've had trouble
scoring all year long, but we look
a little better in some area each
game.”

Over vacation, the squad traveled
north to New York and Pennsyl-
vania. the Generals were defeated
11-3 by a very strong Hofstra Col-
lege. The game, according to Coach
Swan, was an “accurate reflection”
of the two teams’ comparative abil-
ities. Against Penn State, W&L
showed improvement in an unofficial
game, losing in the midst of a bliz-
zard, 9-5.

The squad tallied its first win of
the season against Villanova April
5, 9-8. Last year, a stronger squad
lost to the Villanova club 8-1. As
a whole, Coach Swan asserted that
the trip “served its purpose.”

Next Saturday the Generals play
their first conference game of the
season against Carolina.

Bensinger Writes About Tax, Dodgers

By CHARLIE BENSINGER

Dear Mom and Dad,

And I thought that there was
nothing to write about last week.

any more lively I |)
just won’t be able
to stand it.

Don’t ever let |
anyone tell you |
that we at Wash- |

baseball
teams in the coun-
try have all play-
ed 15 or more
games and we haven't even started,
but we'll catch up. After all, the
Majors haven't started yet either.

 

Bensinger

Speaking of the majors, now that
Sandy and Don have signed, the
Dodgers are the favorites again. Be-
fore the two put their names on the
line the Giants were favored to edge
the Dodgers (who probably would
have had Alston and his wife pitch-
ing for them), but now the odds
have been reversed.

Some said that Koufax was crazy
to team up with Drysdale in 50-50
negotiations, but his old contract
would have been for $105,000 and
his half of the new one is $115,000.
Not bad for a guy would could last
five innings five years ago.

A party system is called for to

is better than a clique system or
one in which whole fraternities rath-

that an ideological division already

exists between campus “conserva-

that needs only to be organized to
give us viable but free political

Campus parties based on individual
membership and entirely divorced

was once the scene of the barbaric
initiation rites of a primitive tribe
which once flourished in this vicinity.
The foolhardy novices were induced
to climb down a steel ladder and
make their way into the midst of a
jungle of exposed electrical wiring,
where they remained for periods up
to three hours.

As if this were not dangerous
enough, the candidates for member-
ship were also menaced by a large
sprinkler faucet directly before their
faces, which might go off at any time.

Humane legislation has of course
erased the last vestiges of this prac-
tice by now, but the spot should
remain an outstanding attraction to
visitors—as witness the appeal pos-
sessed by the Aztec altars of human

of exploiting this attraction would
be to keep the more daring guests |
from attempting to descend into the

Final Collegian
To Be Issued
After Springs

Spectacular Colors And
Additional Pages
Signal End

Due to the recent controversy and
uncertainty of the Southern Col-
legian’s future, and because this will
be the final issue and “the best
ever,” the Collegian will not come
out until the week after Springs,
Editor Jim Crothers said today.

“We could have appeared at
Springs,” Crothers said, “but we
wanted to make this last issue a real
collectors item.”

Some of the additional features
the extra week will allow include
eight extra pages and a fold-out
section similar to Playboy’s. The
Collegian will also feature a lot of
color both on the cover, and inside,
and lots of colorful written material.

“This will be the most profession-
ally done magazine ever connected
with Washington and Lee,” the editor
predicted. A new type of printing
process permits the Collegian these
new alterations.

The theme will be, appropriately,
“Hairy Collegian is dead.” This,
along with several satirical articles
about the “Hill” show clearly the
staff's unhappiness at the recent
faculty decision to withhold money
from the Collegian next year.

The staff got together, Crothers
said, and “decided to put out one
good, big issue as a final parting
shot,” rather than two regular is-
sues. “We thought after a Spring's
edition, a Final’s issue would be
anti-climatic,” he said. Therefore,
this April 22 edition will be the last
ever to appear at Washington and
Lee unless the faculty reconsiders
or if it is published privately.

Keegin noted in making the an-
nouncement that there has not been
any definite assignment of responsi-
bilities to the new committee mem-
bers. He added, however, “Such as-
signments should be of no difficulty,
for each of these men appears to be
capable of handling any phase of the
program with imagination and skill.”

“I am extremely pleased,” Keegin
went on to say, “that these gentle-

 

|men have

volunteered to serve on
the committee, and I am confident
that together we will be able to put
together a program that will be stim-
ulaing to every member o fthe stu-
dent body.”

Fellman, in expressing his appre-
ciation of the appointees’ willingness
to join the committee, said, “The
committee as a whole will have the
vitality and enthusiasm that each of
these men has displayed in his cam-
pus activities to date. I am certain
that we will be able to make CON-
TACT 1967 an intellectually exciting
experience.”

The first meeting of the committee

will be Thursday, April 14, at 7:30

in the Student Union. The nature
of the meeting will be a discusion
of basic committee organization,

financial support, and a topic for the
program.

‘Best Delegate’
At Mock UN

Two W&L students participated in
the Second Annual Hollins College
Model United Nations Security
Council this past weekend. Fred
Mindel and Steve Saunders repre-
sented the United Kingdom. At the
conclusion of the session on Satur-
day, Saunders was named “Best
Delegate” of the Council.

All of the Fulbright Scholars at
Washington and Lee attended the
sessions, as did several other inter-
ested students.

Agenda

The agenda included Viet Nam,
Southern Rhodesia, and the Domi-
niacn Republic. Nineteen colleges in
the South and East took part, includ-
ing Yale, Princeton, University of
North Carolina, VMI, VPI, and Duke
University.

Colin Wilson, First Secretary of
the British Embassy in Washington,
addressed the delegates on Thursday
night. Lord Caradon, U.K. Ambas-
sador to the U.N., was originally
scheduled as the speaker, but was
called home to London at the last
minute for instructions on the Rho-
desia crisis.

Heavy Preparation

The award for “Best Delegation”
went to Mali. The University of
North Carolina, representing the So-
viet Union won the award last year.

Preparation involved over sixty
hours of research, according to
Mindel and Saunders, including sev-
eral trips to the United Nations
headquarters in New York and the

 

British United Nations Mission.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Tuesday Edition

An Unrivaled Opportunity

The Independent Study Plan has been passed 7-1 by the
Executive Committee, after receipt of the report by the special
committee headed by Junior Jim Awad. Basically, the plan
involves ending the Fall semester in December, and devoting
most of January to independent preparation of individual
study papers. Subjects for the papers would be selected by
each student, the details being worked out with his faculty
adviser. Students could leave Lexington during this period,
for purposes of research.

Here lies the main point of contention: Will students
abuse this month-long, restriction-free period? This is in the
back of everyone’s mind. There are other considerations, such
as rescheduling of sports events and Fancy Dress, and the fi-
nancial strain some students will face traveling away from Lex-
ington for research. However, this question of the student body
entering into the spirit of the program is paramount.

At Colgate, the plan is now in its second year, and the col-
lege intends to continue it. To be sure, there were the slackers,
those who saw the independent study period as a month-long
extension of the Christmas recess. However, these were the
insouciant fringe present on every campus. The overwhelming
majority of Colgate’s students turned in creditable work. Few
received ‘Honors’ ratings, but the work of still fewer was
graded “Unsatisfactory.”

To some W&L students, the proposed Independent Study
Plan may look like a free ticket to New York or Washington.
But to many others, we believe, it will represent an unrivaled
opportunity for the creative and stimulating academic ex-
perience so urgently needed at Washington and Lee.

It will not be easy. Semester-long courses will have to be
compressed, and a heavy burden will be placed on every stu-
dent. But still we feel that it would be worth it. We look
forward with eagerness to the comments and action of the
Faculty, and hope that they will not let this opportunity pass
us by unnoticed.

That Time Of Year

It’s that time of year again. Along with the magnolia and
cherry blossoms, a whole crop of smiling, well-scrubbed can-
didates have suddenly bloomed. But this is as it should be, and
we shall comment no further.

However, what does disturb us are the sounds one hears
from some quarters about Washington and Lee’s need to re-
turn to the tried-and-true vehicle of the political party. These
perennial grumblers complain about the large number of candi-
dates filing for office, and the resultant confusion every voter
faces. Is it not much simpler, they ask, to have the eliminations
done privately at a party caucus, rather than subject the Stu-
dent Body to the inconvenience of a primary? They hastily
add that it is also unfair to the candidates, who are supposedly
indistinguishable, one from the other, because of the large
number in the running.

We answer these grumblers as we did last year: the sys-
tem works, and works well. The lack-luster candidate that can-
not stand out among many could not be made to shine if op-
posed by only one. If he is as good as his backers say, he'll
come out of the primary on the ticket. And finally, if the
Student Body feels it inconvenient to vote in a primary which
we dispute, it will be just as indisposed to vote in the general
election: Over 1000 students voted in the “Big Four” election
last year.

Let these grumblers go on grumbling; they do no harm.
Two freshman classes have grown up without the dubious com-
fort of political cliques, and it is unlikely that we shall go back.
There is a responsible case to be made for political parties but
no proposal has yet come forward which can offer the guaran-
tee of democratic freedom of choice provided by the primary
system.

The candidates are smiling, getting around, and campaign-
ing hard. There are a goodly number of them and it will be a
hard choice. But this is as it should be, and we shall comment
no further.

Those Magnificient Men

As the W&L Self-Study Program nears its conclusion, it
seems only fitting to extend our appreciation and thanks to

 

 

those faculty members who gave of their time and energy
as analysts in the several sections of the report. They patiently
answered student questions, attended endless meetings, and
then correlated the whole mass of material into a coherent
and meaningful report. Often maligned, misunderstood, mis-
quoted, and sometimes mistaken, these men did yeoman
service. They have our thanks.

Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained

 

By BRUCE W. RIDER
“Something there is that doesn’t love
a beard,

That wants it off”

(From the beloved poem,
Faces Make Good Students.)

Not many moons ago I awoke in
the dead of night gripped with fear.
Gradually, with
out quite being
aware of it, I had
become a Wash-
ington and Lee
man. (Not the
W&L man of the
University Cata-
logue but the real
kind we have
wending their way
about the cam-
pus).

It had happened
had happened so subtly that I never
knew when I had crossed over into
Washington and Leemanship. Now I
spoke, looked, studied, did every-
thing like everybody else. Was it
too late? In a desperate attempt to
escape my fate I began to grow a
beard. Not a great hairy all-over
one, Just a goatee. It might be my
last chance.

Clean

Rider

By JOE FRAMPTOM

I do not favor rush being held at
the beginning of the first semester as
is currently the case. I feel that a
good case can be made in support
of rush during the opening weeks
of the second semester, or perhaps at
the end of the first semester. If the
suggestion for a period of indepen-
dent study during the month of
January is adopted, it would seem
that those four weeks would present
an ideal opportunity for a more
leisurely and meaningful rush period

With a beard I no longer looked
like a W&L man, but could I break
away from other patterns the Uni-
versity had tried to set for me in
the Four Year Plan?

Would I be lost if I had to meet
someone and not have to ask him
“What house are you in?” Could I
ever think that there might even
be something more important that
coats and ties?

Professorial Truth. To say what was
really on my mind and to keep away
from the glib smoothness I'd been
trained to speak.

But it was no use. W&L is no
place to be different. The closer you
fit the groove the more it will be
smooth. Dress cutely, stamp out dif-
ference and change. Get all you can
for old Number One.

Yes, gentle reader, the beard was
shaved off. Why fight our great
system. I’m going back to writing
tests and papers that would make
any professor’s heart beat faster,
knowing that this young lad has
finally come to the Truth.

I had learned my lesson all too
well. It would be hard to turn over
a new coat and tie at this late hour.
I had learned to play the Academic
Game of handing back to the profes-
sor his own gems of wisdom rather
than setting forth my own ideas.
After all, who am I, a mere student,
to know anything on my own? And
why take the trouble? Yet... could
I break away from this game to try
honestly to learn for myself?

We wear coats and ties and act
sophisticatedly and keep aloof from
the common rabble. We are Washing-
ton and Lee men. We are a damn
sight better than anybody else. We're
stronger, more handsome, smarter
than the rest of the world. And we
deserve to be.

I'm glad I'm back in the fold. It’s
much too painful to strike out on
your own.

At Washington and Lee we strive
for for the Golden Mean. We are
golden. We are mean.

Could I ever learn again not to
think in stereotypes? Not to laugh
at and hate people and things dif-
ferent from the glorious perfection
of Washington and Lee?

For a while I tried to be honest.

Graduate Advocates Dress
Traditions As A Great Gift
To The Present Generation

To the Editor:

I read with some dismay in the
fall issue of the Alumni Magazine of
the erosion of the time honored tra-
dition of conventional dress in the
spring of 1965. I also had occasion
to read President Cole’s challenge to
the student body in his address at
the University assembly at the be-
ginning of this school year, and I
understood your response to that
challenge was most gratifying,

I hope that the tradition of con-
ventional dress, begun long ago, suf-
fers no further erosion in the warm
months of this spring.

Who does the tradition belong to?
Just to you, the members of the
present student body, or also to the
long line of Washington and Lee
men who have preceded you at the
University? Those that have gone
before you have sustained with pride
and dignity the tradition of con-
ventional dress and we will not sit
idly by while you destroy it.

We have just as much an interest
in the preservation of values and at-
titudes at Washington and Lee as
you do, the present generation of
students. Washington and Lee be-
longs to us all!

Briggs Besitens
E. C. Activities
This Past Year

By WARD BRIGGS

Having followed the actions of the
EC this year, I have been pleased
with its achievements but slightly

disappointed that

the changes which

are so vitally

needed have not
% had the necessary
time in which to
be properly effect-
ed. This past year
has been crucial to
the maintenance of
the University’s
position amongst
other schools, but
next year will
prove to be decisive.

 

This is a time for examination of
the traditions which have formed
the foundations of our school’s repu-
tation. We must examine whether
or not change is necessary in sev-
eral areas.

Rush Week

I feel Rush Week should be con-
ducted under much the same lines
as it is now, but the deadline for
pledging should be considerably ex-
tended. Rush Week should be a time
for acquaintance with the fraternity
and acknowledgement of any interest
the freshman might have. But the
number of people who de-pledge or
who eventually drop out of a house
would show that the system is too
accelerated; that freshmen are too
immediately pressed to do fraternity
work to become acquainted with
their studies, and to participate in
freshman athletics

Deferring the deadline of pledging
to perhaps the mid-semester or the
semester would push the freshman
a little less precipitously toward a
hasty decision and give him a bet-
ter chance to select his own pledge
Both houses and freshmen
would be able to form more realistic
concrete conceptions

class
and of each
other

Another that is
sorely needed is a thorough curricu-
lum study. I feel there should be a
board of students who can evaluate
recommend or condemn both courses
and professors. There is no adequate
mouthpiece for student opinion about
such matters as this and I feel such
would benefit both the

ion, and for the freshmen who enter

After forty (40) minutes of delib-

of not guilty in the Spring Mock
Trial at the Rockbridge County

The proceeding were sponsored by

for the City of Lexington, served as

judge.

The defendant, Joseph Smith, por-

walks. So effective was he
not until the ninth inning was W&L
able to put two men on base at the
same time.

Old Dominion scored its first run
in the second inning when back-to-
back singles sandwiched around a
balks produced a run after two
outs. Old Dominion then picked up
two more runs in the third and
single runs in the fifth and sixth
innings.

But the run in the second proved
to be all the margin Carlson needed
as he had the General batters hit-
ting to his fielders all day long.
Luke Crosland got W&L’s first hit—
a single in the third. In the fifth,
Eric Sisler lined a double down the
first baseline but was out trying to
reach third base on the hit. W&L’s
last hit came in the seventh—a
single by Dave Kirkpatrick.

Coach Lyles was optimistic after
the game, saying that the boys
played a good ball game and should
have a good season. He cited Old
Dominion as “a good ball club, but
one that had played already ten
games prior to ours.” Coach Lyles
feels that as soon as the boys get the
experience under their belts, the vic-
tories will come.

Six General Trackmen |
Compete at Williamsburg |

Coach Norm Lord sent six Wash-
ington and Lee thinly clads to Wil-
liamsburg Saturday to compete in
the Colonial Relays. None brought
home against rugged competition that
broke twelve meet records.

Eric Mynttinen, Bill Wildrick, Riff
O'Connor, Jim Thompson, Bob
Stack and Lee Johnson represented
the Generals.

The four mile relay team placed
fourth out of six teams entered.
Running in the event were Co-
captain Thompson, Stack, O’connor,
and Wildrick. Johnson, the other co-
captain, was supposed to run but
dropped out in favor of Wildrick who
was acting as team manager. Johnson
has long been plagued this season
by leg trouble.

Mynttinen threw the javelin 187
feet, approximately the distance that
brought him second place in the
same meet last year. However, it
wasn’t even good enough this year
to be measured. The winner tossed
the javelin 226 feet.

The stiff opposition was furnished
by such track powers as UVa, North

Westchester State, Wake Forest, and
the host school, William and Mary.

Columnist Praises ODK Forum

(Continued from page 2)

Comprised of the most influential
leaders on the campus, the Forum
can provide both an important liaison
between the students and the faculty
and provide an intellectual forum in
which controversial issues such as
NSA and integration plans can be
discussed.

The Forum can also solicit faculty
opinion so that matters of importance
such as the question of having girls
in the dorms, or of subsidizing the
Southern Collegian can be dealt with
jointly by the faculty and students
rather than by one first and then the
other.

Girls in the Dorms

I feel the girls in the dorms mat-
ter was handled poorly by the facul-
ty and that the matter should be
brought up again next year and from
then on, as long as student opinion
favors it. The Southern Collegian is
an institution rather than a tradition
and should be kept alive as the
important literary magazine it once
was, providing a market and accept-
ance of the creative talents of mem-
bers of the student body, talents
which too often are wasted in ob-
livion.

I also feel there should be a read-
ing period of two weeks before ex-
ams in which the student would be
required to read certain books for
each course at his own speed, and
then be responsible for them on
the exam. This would give more time
for concerted reading and some slight
relaxation before exams.

The change which most needs ex-

while maintaining the distinct per-
sonality of our campus. The tradition

enforcement of conventional dress.

A tradition relies solely on the
sincerity of the student body. If
the focus of the students is shifting
to concerns other than those of
dress, it would seem apparent that
the enforcement as well as the tra-
dition must be done away with. If
people make up their minds that
they will assert themselves by dress-
ing sloppily, they must submit to the
consequences; whether it be social
octracization or social probation.

I am personally in favor of the
tradition but not for any enforcement
of it, on the grounds that we must
not allow students to be suspended
or fined for a matter of such indi-
vidual concern.

If it is the feeling of the student
body, however, that conventional
dress be made a rule, the EC must
be ready to accept and enforce the
will of the student body.

Executive Committeeman Discusses Rush

ized rush parties would eliminate
the great expense of case after case
of beer. Costs of the entire rush
program would be greatly reduced.

A Realistic Solution

I don’t believe that the above sug-
gestion is so unrealistic that it
warrants no consideration. Certainly
there are many details that must be
worked out. Is there any reason
why they can’t be? Unfortunately,
yes! Fraternity men will immediately
say, “We cannot possibly go through
the first semester without the addi-
tional money,” or “What will we
do for pledges to wait on us and
amuse us?”, or “How will freshmen
get down the road?” or “Look how
restricted the freshmen’s social life
will be!” Such men will veto a sec-
ond semester rush program.

There are legitimate objections to
a second semester program but I
question the contention that they
outweigh the favorable factors. I
believe it is time for fraternity men
to make a close reevaluation of the
importance and meaning of rush
week as it now exists. A revampment
of the rush proceedure could in-
ject into the fraternity system a new
purpose and a new direction. Most
of us know that these are needed,
yet most of us also refuse to admit
such a fact, even to ourselves.

Want, Grant
Top Runoff
For Secretary

Primary elections yesterday re-
duced to two the number of candi-
dates in the races for secretary of
the student body and for Fancy
Dress president.

Billy Want and Bill Grant, with
312 and 152 votes respectively, won
the primary election for student
body secretary, while Ed Allen and
Warren Stewart won the primary
for Fancy Dress President with 319
and 141 votes.

Both Want and Grant won a ma-
jority in the primaries with 58.5%
and 58% of votes, respectively.

A total of only 533 votes were cast
in the primary for the office of sec-
retary and only 550 for Fancy Dress
President. This number contrasts
sharply with the 1033 votes cast
last year for secretary and the 990
for FD President in the final elec-
tions. While some students have
taken the low turnout at the pri-
maries as a specific symptom of the
general apathy which has prevailed
up until now during this year’s elec-
tion, EC members emphasize that
there will be a larger turnout Mon-
day.

As a result of yesterday's primary,
the following slate will be presented

Collegian Case
May Go Back
Before Faculty

The future of the controversial
Southern Collegian took a turn for
the better this week as the Student
Affairs Committee recommended to
the faculty that Drew Baur, rep-
resenting the Publications Board,
be allowed to present the case
concerning the Collegian to the gen-
eral faculty at its May meeting.

The move means that the faculty
may reconsider its decision last
month to discontinue University
sponsorship and financial aid to
the humor magazine. After appeals
by the Friday Ring-tum Phi, and the
Publications Board among others,
University President Fred C. Cole
had referred the decision of the fac-

This evening’s concert in Doremus Gymnasium presents
two Motown groups, the Marvelettes and Smoky Robinson
and the Miracles. Both groups have released great single re-
cordings. The Marvelettes’ hit songs are “Playboy,” “Please,
“Beechwood 4-5789,” and, most recently,
‘Don’t Mess With Bill.” Smoky Robinson and the Miracles
are known best for “You're Really Got a Hold On Me.”

Tomorrow's concert, which begins®

THE RING.

TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Friday Edition

I?s Not Too Soon

As W&L’s first clique-free Big Four election drags toward
its uninspired and uninspiring conclusion, it would appear that
another sideshow in what used to be The Greatest Show on
Earth—Washington and Lee’s Circus—has folded its tents
and gone to join Dorm Rush and the Food Riot in the back
issues of the Ring-tum Phi.

Sharp-eyed observers have not reported even one example
of the Common Rumor or Cliquemaster’s Friend, once the
commonest harbringer of spring on this campus. If any fresh-
men have been threatened with whips and thumbscrews for
thinking disloyal thoughts, they have not chosen to tell us
about it. And nobody’s Weejuns smell of 3.2 beer from slop-
ping around in the traditional overflow of political generosity.

With the obvious exception of the last item, nobody except
the occasional cowboy who would like to be back in the saddle
again regrets the disappearance of these phenomena. Despite
their entertainment value, W&L is better off without them.

And yet, despite all the mudslinging, hypocrisy and gen-
eral viciousness that characterized the old-style election, it
appears that this university lost something when it disappeared.
Like that equally silly institution, the national party conven-
tion, it served a purpose, and if something is not found to fill
the gap which it leaves, W&L will be poorer.

For it may have something to do with the coincidence of
Springs Weekend and it may have something to do with the
atrocious weather, but the fact remains that less interest has
been apparent in this election than in any other in memory—
among the student body, among the faculty, and even, it
would seem, among the candidates themselves.

The danger in this is not that unqualified candidates will be
elected to office. It is obvious from the results of yesterday’s
primary that we are assured of competent and energetic leaders,
whatever the student body may decide on Monday. (The
Friday Ring-tum Phi extends it special congratulations to Bill
Jeffress, who has displayed as much ability and experience
as could possibly be looked for in an EC President, and hopes
that this regrettable lack of opposition will not hamper him dur-
ing his year in office.)

No, the trouble is that election week is not only the time
when the student body chooses its leaders; it is the only chance
we have of effectively expressing our feeling on the direction
the university should take. The students of W&L have labor-
iously won for themselves in the last few years a qualified right
to share in important administrative decisions. It would be
a pity if this right were to go by the board through lack of

 

interest.

And whtaever the deficiencies of the kind of bitterly
fought election which used to be held at W&L, it at least forced
out but the most apathetic students to stand up and be count-
ed on a few vital issues at least. To take only the most recent
and familiar issue, the candidacies of Fred Mindel and Bob Lee
last year reached into every corner of the W&L community
and made every student examine his views in the light of the
of the new ideas which these candidates put forward; no such
examination has taken place this year.

It is already too late and too close to the Springs baccha-
nalia for the traditional editorial injunction to consider the
issues and vote wisely to have any effect (if it ever did, which is
doubtful). But perhaps it is not to early for the students, and
especially the officers who will be chosen Monday, to consider
ways and means of reviving the mudslinging, backbiting, but
concerned spirit of the extinct clique election.

Faculty Poll and Interviews Indicate
Cut System Hurts Grades and Classes

“Freedom in determining class
attendance is not a right but a
privilege demanding the exercise
of a sense of responsibility. In
short, the faculty regards educa-
tion as a collective enterprise in
which a responsible student body is
as important as a responsible fac-
ulty.”

By WARREN MONTGOMERY
When the long-awaited liberalized
cut system was passed late last year,
it was greeted by
student applause
and the creditable
intentions of the
faculty, as ex-
pressed in the
above preamble to
the 1965 Absence
Regulations. Em-
bodying a suspen-
sion of the first
semester automat-
ic rule, unlimited
cuts for juniors
and seniors, and generous cuts for
underclassmen, the new system has
been effective for a semester and a
half now.

To evaluate the new cut policy in
regard to its effect on grades and
its possible elicitation of student re-
sponsibility, a poll has been taken of
the entire undergraduate faculty, and
the Dean of Students and several
professors have been interviewed.
The results, while occasionally qual-
ified, show several definite trends.

Summarizing the faculty poll and
disregarding the less decisive an-
swer percentages and their ques-
tions, we may conclude that‘ (1)
Most students have treated the cut

 

Montgomery

 

system responsibly, but a consider-

 

 

able minority has grossly abused it

and has suffered a marked fall in
grades. (2) Class attendance has
dropped, though not drastically, and

(3) most professors want to keep the
system as it is, at least for the time
being. Finally, (4) students who at-
tend classes regularly are more like-
ly to get help from their professors
while, conversly, consistent cutters
are likely to suffer more-or-less sub-
conscious retaliation by way of low-
er grades,
Faculty Questionnaire

The faculty poll consisted of six
questions meant to determine the
practical effects of the new cut sys-
tem and a multiple seventh ques-
tion attempting to summarize fac-
ulty personal opinion. Thirty-five
percent (33 out of 96) of the pro-
fessors to whom questionnaires were

;given sent them in.

The first question asked if the stu-
dents generally treated the cut sys-
tem and the automatic rule suspen-
sion in a responsible manner. Eighty
per cent said yes, 15 per cent said
no, and two professors refused to
comment.

On the second question, dealing
with class attendance, 73 per cent
admitted that their class attendance
has dropped relative to last year,
and 21 per cent stated that their
attendance has remained the same.
Again, two declined to comment.
number three asked if

system should be returned to
> way it was, liberalized further,
left as it is. Sixty-four per cent
chose the latter, 15 per cent wanted
to return it to the more strict policy,
and 15 per cent wanted to further

Question

 

liberalize it (presumably to give
freshmen and sophomores unlimit-
ed cuts). “Liberalize it,’ remarked
one professor, “and let the rest of
them hang themselves. They
shouldn’t be babied at all.”

Heavy Comment

Questions 4, 5, and 6 drew heavy
comment. Number four asked if the
professor is more inclined to give
advice and help to students who
attend class regularly. Eighty per
cent said yes. “I am very reluctant
to spend time with chronic cutters,”
remarked one teacher. Another com-
mented that “students more or less
regularly attending class deserve
more attention than those who do
ot.” Others stated that they prefer
to advise regular attendants because
their questions are more knowledg-
able and intelligent.

The fifth question asked if the
students’ cut records in any way,
even subjectively, affect the grades
given. Fifty-two per cent said yes,
42 per cent said no, and two did not
comment. Several professors cited
the importance of the subjective
in grading, especially in seminar, dis-
cussion, and oral language courses.
“It is hard for a disinterested student
to conceal his disinterest,” one pro-
professor pointed out. “I cannot help
noticing at exam time that TOTAL-
LY unfamiliar faces do show up.”
It also seems that professors have
feelings: “A professor never likes to
see 5 attenders in a class of 20.”
Retaliation may play a part in low-
ered grades.

In the sixth question, regarding
private cut systems, only two pro-
fessors admitted having some sort

of method of intentionally reward-
ing regularly attending students or
penalizing the cutters.

The seventh question offered seven
categories of opinion (any number
of which could be agreed with) and
invited comment, All but one pro-
fessor indicated that grades have
been generally lowered under the
new cut system. Fifty-two per cent
think that the low grades will teach
the students a greater sense of re-
sponsibility, and 27 per cent feel that
“the selective elimination of irre-
sponsible students” will raise the
academic caliber of the University.
Twelve per cent indicated that W&L
is failing to meet its in loco parentis
obligations to students and their par-
ents in maintaining the liberal regu-
lations; however, another 12 per
cent stated that student indepen-
dence is preferable to higher grades.
Nine per cent feel that the low
grades are placing the University in-
to academic difficulties.

Revealing Comments

Comments were prolific and often
revealing. One professor said that
the spirit of the cut system assumes
that students are “mature enough to
judge whether attendance at a lec-
ture or some other activitiy will best
contribute to their own academic
development.” This professor feels
that “spending time in the library
instead of at a poor lecture, attend-
ance at... political, scholarly, and
professional meetings,” and prepa-
ration of papers and research “re-
quiring intense concentration for a
considerable period of time” are in
the spirit of the cut system. But,
he continued, “sitting on one’s duff
in the fraternity house, last minute
cramming for an exam, and sack-
ing in...amount to a_ strongly
worded insult to the idea of educa-
tion and to the University.”

Another professor caustically com-
mented that “the experience of this
semester shows me only a conspicu-
ous lack of integrity and maturity
on (the students’) part.” Wrote an-
other, “Students absences

too much trouble

‘sank’ last semester.”

More favoreble to the students,
another professor feels “that the
University did a particularly poor
job of communicating to the stu-
dents exactly what their responsi-
bilities under the system are. I am

convinced that grades (and indi-
viduals) would have suffered less if
a good job had been done in com-

munications.”
Dean Atwood

Dean Edward C. Atwood added to
the finding of the poll by offering
some class statistics. “There has
been a substantial increase in the
number of juniors and seniors com-
ing under academic probation this
year, compared to those falling un-
der the automatic rule last year
There has been no similar increase
for freshmen and sophomores.” He
concluded that since the automatic
rule suspension applies to all under-
graduate classes and that free cuts
apply only to the juniors and sen-
iors, the cut system must be to blame

| for the marked drop in junior and

senior grades. He added, however,
that “the majority of juniors and
seniors have treated cuts responsi-
bly. It is certain individuals who
have caused the upper classes’ low-
er academic record.” Last semester,
five upperclassmen had cut prive-
lees removed for extraordinarily
irresponsible overcutting

avoided cutting partially

Conclusion

In conclusion, it seems that whil

and half of the faculty response

Charlie’s Sundry Comments

By CHARLIE BENSINGER
Dear Mom and Dad,

Well, I can honestly say that one
of the oldest traditions here at
Washington and Lee is being con-
tinued with gus-
to this weekend.

It seems that in
_ the past entertain-
_ ers have often got-
; ten lost on the
) way to this thriv-
ying center of
of transportation,
and others have
simply elected not
to attempt to catch
their _ friendly
neighborhood jets.

So it is with no great surprise that
we learn Fontella Bass isn’t here.
It’s a good thing Betty Everett is.

There are other traditions here
that do go well with Springs how-
ever.

There is Goshen with its rapid
waters and slow streams, distin-

Georgetown Clubs Golfers
6-3, As Matthews Cards
Low Team Score of 72

Washington and Lee's Varsity
Golf team lost to Georgetown Uni-
versity Tuesday 6-3 in a match that
was, as Coach E. P. “Cy” Twombly
put it “closer than the score shows.”

The Generals’ low score was a 72,
shot by freshman Bobby Matthews.
Spencer Sullivan scored W&L’s other
individual win. Bob Duckwall, Sul-
livan’s partner lost his match, but
Duckwall and Sullivan took the best
ball. Matthews’ partner, Roger Sen-
nott lost his match.

In the first foursome, Ed Crosland
carded a 73 but lost to Georgetown’s
top man with a match low of 71.
Crosland and his partner Jim Ful-
wider lost the best ball one down.

The team was scheduled to meet
Lynchburg College yesterday, but
the match was postponed to April
27 due to a conflicting ladies tour-
nament on the Lynchburg course.

There is Goshen with the outdoor

the stallions, and their mares. Isn’t
it wonderful that there isn’t a local
police station out there?

There is the sunny weather as
the weather man tries to make up
for Fancy Dress. By the most conser-
vative estimates he owes us over
twenty-five weekends of warmth
and sun just to atone for this
year’s F.D. 40-inch snow job. Note:
If it rains, attempts will be made to
circulate a student petition de-
manding his resignation.

I've been looking over the paper
as it stands so far, very, very late
on Friday afternoon, as I try to
fill up this incredible hole that
somehow has crept onto our Es-
teemed Page. Of particular interest,
seeing as this is Springs Weekend,
is Mr. H.L.H’s editorial, mentioning
the great W&L Circus. Well, looking
over some of the dates that arrived
by lunchtime today, it seems that
this year’s sideshow is going to be
better than ever.

While I'm on the subject of criti-
cal appraisal, we'd like to present
our “Milford Citizen” layout of the

sports staff. They haven't broken the
tradition this year yet—at least one,
usually two or more, news strictly

Generals’ Netmen Continue Successes
With 7-2 Victory Over W. Virginia

Coach Verne Canfield’s W&L net-
men continued their winning ways
as they stopped the Mountaineers of
the University of West Virginia,7-2,
in a match yesterday at the Home-
stead, Hot Springs, Virginia.

This was the racketmen’s third
victory in as many outings, and kept
up the team’s hopes for a very
successful season,

Paced by freshmen ace Tommy
Rueger and team captain Forrest
Dickinson, holding down the num-
ber one and two singles spots re-
spectively, the Generals took four
of the six singles events and swept
all three of the doubles matches.

*Rueger, who has yet to lose a singles

or doubles match in varsity compe-
tition this year, was forced to go
three sets to won his opponent, 6-0,
3-6, and 6-3. Rueger then teamed
with freshman Ray Turman to post
a 6-1, 3-6, 6-1 victory in the num-
ber one doubles slot.

Captain Dickinson had it a little
easier than Rueger in his singles
match at the number two position,
needing only two set to defeat his
opponent, 6-1 and 7-5. The story
was somewhat different in his

 

doubles match; Dickinson and letter-
man Phil Thompson fought a mara-
thon duel in the number two spot,
finally emerging victorious by the
score of 14-12, 6-8, and 7-5.

The Generals’ other wins came
at the number four singles spot
where undefeated Drew Bauer
posted posted a 6-2, 6-4 victory; the
number five singles position where
Turman breezed to a 6-2, 6-1 tri-
umph; and in the number three
doubles event in which Steve Case
and Fred Taussig posted their third
straight win, 6-3, 6-3.

The Generals’ next match is Mon-
day at 3 p.m. on the W&L varsity
courts. Lynchburg College, a team
that Washington and Lee easily
handled last year 9-0, will furnish
the opposition. Coach Canfield,
thongh, is not taking the match
lightly. When questioned about this
year’s Lynchburg squad, he said that
“one or two new boys can mean
all the difference to a team, we are
going out there considering that
they are tough.”

Coach Canfield then spoke at some
length on the team’s chances for a
succesful season, saying that he be-

ironically a high school teammate of
W&L co-captain Lance Bendann
and goalie Dave Johnson.

According to Coach Swan, “Car-
olina is a tough, experienced ball
club. It’s our first league game in
the Strobhar division, and our peo-
ple are really pointing for it; this is
for the money now. We hope to be
in top shape physically. We feel
we're ready to break loose on of-
fense; our defense has so far held
up.

lieved the squad could better the
winning record it posted last year.
He said that he was especially
pleased with the play of Rueger and
Turman, the two freshmen on the
varsity squad. When asked about the
remainder of the season, Coach Can-
field replied that he expected strong
opposition from the rest of the teams
on the Generals schedule, and that
UVa., Randolph-Macon and Old
Dominion would be especially hard
to handle. He went on to assert that
“the squad should be in excellent
condition for the CAC Tournament
in St. Louis; our chances for win-
ning are excellent.”

Coach Canfield then turned his
attention to his freshman teams
which he said were definitely strong-
er than last year’s squads and had
a good deal more tennis experience.
“The freshmen have a very import-
ant role in our program,” Canfield
commented, “I expect some freshmen

... double winner

 

men to move up to the varsity by
the end of the season.”
The freshmen squad was rained

out in its last match with SMA
last week. It will make its first
appearance on the W&L courts

on Tuesday, April 26, when it faces
Virginia Episcopal. The team consists
of Dan McClure, Joe Davenport,
Britt McJunkin, Chris Meyer, John
White and Jerry Perlman.

 

General Nine

To Face H-S

Washington and Lee’s baseball
team “hopefully” plays Hampden-
Sydney at home today in the second
game of the season. The “hopefully”
refers to the weather, which has
forced postponement of the Bridge-
water and cancellation of the
Georgetown games.

Hampden-Sydney has had a good
deal more experience than the Gen-
erals, taking a Spring trip to Flor-
ida and droping “a few” games to
Jacksonville University.

W&L’s practices have been min-
imized by the rain and cold. A very
depressed Coach Joe Lyles stated
that “the pitchers just aren’t warm;
they can’t fire. We haven’t been out-
side for several days. The whole ball
club is losing their muscular move-
ments; inactivity is taking its toll
on the boy’s cardiovascular endur-
ance in running. We are at least two
weeks behind. Hampden-Sydney
has always had a respectable ball
club. They've probably played ten
more games than we have; they've
been winning and losing. We'll just
have to play it by ear.”

 

Applications for the position of
dormitory counsellors for next year
should be submitted to Dean At-
wood's office by next Friday.

cellent chance for final passage. I
favor this because I do not believe
that students would use the Student
Union facilities if beer is not allowed.
There should be a continual and re-
ciprocal exchange of information be-
tween the EC, the four standing com-
mittees and the student body.

The _ Assimilation Committee
should take on the positive func-
tion of better orienting freshmen by
providing printed information on
opportunities in clubs, publications,
and other activities. A dormitory
committee composed of head and
assistant head dorm _ counselors
should handle disciplinary problems
in the dormitory. A junior year
abroad program should be estab-
lished at W&L.

A curriculum committee which
would take suggestions from the
student body evaluating the courses
at W&L, should be established. A
more flexible exam schedule is
needed. Students with a G.P.R. of
1.5 or better should have the op-
portunity of taking one ungraded
course outside their major each se-
mester. The purpose is to allow stu-
dents to take courses that they would
like to take but are afraid would
hurt their G.P.R.

A genuinely good paperback book
store should be operated at W&L in
a manner to place a large number
of books in the hands of students
even if it operates at a small loss.

The EC should explore with the
administration the possibilities of
getting additional quiet study places.
The Southern Collegian should be
continued but financed by another
method.

If elected I will work for the ac-
complishment of as much of this
platform as possible. I will also try
to represent the views of the student
body and will appreciate any sug-
gestions. Finally, I am prepared to
devote the time and effort necessary
to the fulfillment of the secretary of

the student body.

are those such as what is left of
the speaking tradition, conventional
dress and the Honor System—char-
acteristics of W&L that make it
distinctive and must be maintained.

On the other hand our school is
changing generally so we must con-
tinue to improve. I feel that a great
deal can and should be done to im-
prove the Freshman year both in
the curriculum and dorms and so-
cial. Each year there are a grow-
ing number of independent students
and improvements must be made for
them—the new Co-op and Student
Union will provide the new EC with
an excellent chance to show its
leadership in this field. I feel the
EC should actively work with facul-
ty and administration to represent
student views on courses, curricu-
Jum, and every aspect of life at
W&L. The EC should also work for
student independence as much as
possible to avoid administration de-
erees coming through student organ-
izations and activities such as the
abolishment of the Collegian.
I am not listing a platform of ten
or twelve “actions” I am going to
take since I feel anyone who has
seen a W&L election before realizes:
1) platforms vary little from year
to year, 2) from candidate to can-
didate, 3) the adeas are usually
quckly forgotten after elections, 4)
and even if elected there is little
the person can do to achieve his
action since most of the matters he
is representing you on have little
to do with his platform.
For this reason I have tried to
tell you generally how I feel, for if
elected my duty would be to seek
out your views and my obligation
to represent you.

The Convocation was followed by

In making the ruling, however, EC
members expressed their dissatis-
faction with the fact that only two
of the offices were contested by
more than two candidates, and that
only one candidate appeared for
president.

According to the terms of the con-
stitution, Jeffress will be elected by
100% of the votes cast for president
in Monday's election, since no other
candidates’ name may be placed on
the ballot, and write-ins will be
counted as no vote.

As in primary elections, voting
will take place Monday in the Stu-
dent Union from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Judicial Board Announces

Official IFC Nominations
For Elections on Monday

By JOHN LEE

At last night’s IFC meeting, Billy
Cannon presented the Judicial
Board’s nominations for membership
on next year’s Judicial Board, and
additional nominations were tak-
en. The official nominations are, for
President, Ren Manning and Roger
Milam, and for Vice-President, Bar-
ry Vaught.

Three candidates are now running
for Secretary, Kaz Herchold, Mike
Miles, and Jim Kiersky; and for
Treasurer, John Reynolds has been
nominated.

Senior Justice at Large candidate

Jody Luck Tom Baremore,
Ellis Zahre, Barry Crosby, and Bill
Stone will vie for Junior Alternate
Justice positions. John Lee the
nominee for Rush Chairman and for
Social Chairman is Ed Allen. Round-

is as

is

ing out the slate is Kaz Herchold,
nominated for Editor of the IFC
Rush Book. Elections will be held

next Monday night.

New Constitution

Copies of the revised IFC Consti-
tution were given to IFC members.
Including the definition of a social
function and rush rules, the Consti-
tution incorporates previous changes
and minor revisions such as, chang-
ing the “Town of Lexington” to the
“City of Lexington.”

The matter of booking for combos
was discussed. Some houses have ex-
pressed dissatisfaction concerning
certain combos who have failed to
arrive for scheduled engagements, as
well as indefinite planning on the
part of booking agents. Ed Allen sug-
gested that in the future, fraterni-
ties should not book any combo
which has failed to arrive more than
once.

IFC Slate

Originally, the slate was to be of-
fered at last Monday’s meeting, and
voted on by the IFC at their meet-
ing last night. However, the IFC
Judicial Board did not receive a
sufficient number of applications and
extended the deadline for applica-
cations. The present was the

slate s
product of that second meeting.

IFC slates of candidates have not
fared well in the past. Last year,
the Judicial Board nominated Geoff
Butler, who was defeated by Chuck
Griffiin, who was nominated from
the floor. The previous year, Brooks
Brown was designated by the Judi-
cial Board, only to be ousted by
Steve Hibbard. An interesting race
is anticipated.

A Modest Proposal

As a result of yesterday’s general election, we feel it ap-
propriate to suggest some change in the student body constitu-
tion. Unfortunately, the constitution makes no provision for
write-in candidates since they are not qualified candidates in
the technical sense. According to the wording of the section
concerning elections, a candidate is placed on the ballot only if
he meets certain academic requirements and submits a petition
with one hundred fifty signatures prior to the first Monday
after the spring recess,

In a later paragraph, the constitution indicates that these
candidates must receive a simple majority of the votes cast.
If no candidate receives this required majority, a run-off must
be held for the two candidates with the most votes. There is
not any mention of write-in candidates; probably because the
framers of this lucid document did not anticipate a race with
only one candidate.

 

 

The decision of the Executive Committee not to count
votes of various write-in candidates was based on the limitations
delineated by our constitution. If Mr. Oliver or any other write-
in candidate had received a majority of votes cast, the situation
would have been particularly awkward. Quite obviously, the
EC feels some “moral” obligation to recognize the voice of any
student majority, and yet under our present system the elec-
tion of any write-in candidate would not have been possible.

In order to remedy this inequitable procedure, we propose
a constitutional amendment which would allow write-in candi-
dates in all contests. This special type of candidacy would still
be subject to the academic prerequisites, however, the petition
requirement would be waived. Under this system, the neces-
sary restrictions placed on candidates for student body offices
would be maintained while permitting the electorate some guar-
anteed alternative for each race.

We do believe that petitions serve a valuable and justi-
fable purpose, in that they discourage obviously unqualified
persons, but we also see that absolute adherence to this process
creates problems which are not easily resolved. This proposed
plan would protect the democratic safeguards and advantages
which serve the best interest of the student body. We urge
immediate preparation of a suitable amendment incorporating
these points to be submitted to the student body at the time of
class elections.

 

Challenge Of Spring

Temperatures are rising, the humidity is climbing, and—if
the student body repeats its performance of last spring—coats
will soon disappear, and ties, another perennial victim, will at
best migrate to a seasonal locus about three inches below the
collar. The heat is uncomfortable, and these are the student’s
reactions.

However, we appeal to the student body to make a reason-
able effort to uphold regular standards of conventional dress
during this balmly spring weather. The Executive Committee
has returned discretionary fining power to the Assimilation
Committee, and unless there is a dramatic change from last
year’s experience, a bumper crop of violators will find them-
selves before the committee. Non-appearance when summoned
also carries a fine.

In the fall issue of the Alumni Magazine, an article on the
gradual disappearance of conventional dress featured numer-
ous photographs of students in several abbreviated forms of
traditional attire it was commented that more damage was
done to conventional dress during two months last spring than
had been suffered altogether in the past few years,

The challenge is being offered by the rising mercury, and
students will either have to temper their reactions, or sacrifice
conventional dress. There are better arguments to be made
against the tradition than those of physical discomfort.

A gentleman does not molt in the spring; he does not
shuck his gentlemanly attire with the vernal equinox. We are
confident that the student body is equal to the challenge, and
will at least give the new Assimilation Committee policy a
chance to work.

Columnist Calls Local Police

‘Best East Of Maury River?”

By JAY NEWQUIST

We all know that crime in Lex-
ington is non-existent. Muggings are
inversely proportional in numbers
| to the candlepower of street lights
‘and since this is That Time of Year
| (i.e., Holy Week et al.), we should
j all decide which cheek to turn first.
Even knife fights have no spontane-

townie lurking in the alley only
wants to show his new chain

wrapped lovingly around his neck
like a boa constrictor, Liquor sales
are so good down on lower Main
Street that they purchased a new
bathtub, and some brand new cop-
per tubing.

Because of this lack of crime,
policemen have more time to dole out
traffic tickets. Where else but in
Lexington can someone drive
through a stop sign and pay twenty
dollars? The same privilege is a
bargain at $5 a throw in New York
City.

But we cannot begrudge the Lex-

Rider Looks At Right-Wingers

 

 

By BRUCE W. RIDER

This week, dear readers, we shall
begin a two-part series about peo-
ple. As we all know, people (apart
from the categories of male and
female) come in two sizes: conserva-
tives and liberal. Here at Washington
and Lee University (Lexington, Vir-
ginia 24450) we have one hell of a
lot of the first kind and very few
of the second.
Part first of this fascinating (ho
hum) series will consider the con-
servative man. And the second part,
hopefully to appear next week, will
(you've guessed it already) discus
the liberal man. Are you ready?
A conservative man is. of course,
a man who has something. Therefore,
he wants to conserve what he has.
And he wants to make sure some-
one does not take away that what
he has.
Such a man believes always that
he is right. (Hence conservatives are
ealled ‘right,’ as in ‘right-wing.’)
All of the people who are right are
fellow conservatives. The ones who

 

are left are called ‘leftists,’

 

A Conservative: A Man Who

Has Something To Conserve

The conservative has a great de-
sire to have everyone be just like
he himself is. He is attracted to and
attracts people who think, act, dress,
etc., similarly, and he is not attract-
ed to people or things different from
his conservative self.

After all, it does follow that if the
conservative is right, those who differ
are wrong. And only people who are
right should be entitled to such
things as respect, justice, freedom,
opportunity. Freedom, as every good
conservative knows, means freedom
to be conservative—one never knows
what a liberal might do with his
freedom.

The conservative man feels the
same uneasiness when faced with life
as does any other man. But this is
no reflection upon his proper con-
servative self. He is thus a finger-
pointer, believing that all of the
ills of man are Out There.

“Why can’s people be like me?”
asks the dear conservative. “I'm wel]
educated. 'm wealthy. I'm not ask-
ing anybody's help to get along in
the world. Why can’t people be like

The problem, obviously, is that
nonconservative people are lazy and
greedy. They don’t want to work and
get ahead like good conservatives.
All the trouble in the world is caused
by louts wanting handouts (internal
rhyme).

Many have said that conservatives
oppose change. This is aboslutely un-
true. They would not oppose a
change to more conservatism.

Conservatives have a very quick
reaction to threats from the left.
(This is why they are called ‘reac-
tionaries.’)

The conservative kind of man feels
no responsibility for other people.
He is not hungry, nor ignorant. nor
poor, and it’s certainly not his fault
that other people are. Anyway, hun-
ger and ignorance and poverty are
just ruses used by the clever to
separate the rich from thei: money.
Any conservative in his right mind
knows that.

In our next exciting episode we
shall take a look at the conservative’s
arch-enemy, the liberal.

See you then.

the succulent produce native to this
verdant valley. Neither they nor their
horses read stop signs, so where
the line ends, they stop.

Restless Natives

And traffic fines also pay for a
number of advanced rural civiliza-
tions rumored to exist around Lex-
ington. Having dodged taxes for
years, these microcoisms of culture
are believed to be remnant of a great
Incan colonial out-post. The center
of this rich historical treasure land
is Irish Creek. The denizens may be
seen strolling aimlessly through town
in calico gowns (circa 1840), faded
Confederate army trousers, wearing
Buster Brown sneakers, decoreously
adorned with some rather bold An-
glo-Saxon expletives.

Since little traffic other than the
push-cart crowd enters or escapes
Lexington, the police have enrolled
in school again. Tax money has fi-
nanced various pilgrimages to great
places of learning, ineluding John
Dillinger’s birthplace and the Ma
Baker Memorial.

Favorite Spots

Other favorite spots include Aca-
pulco, where hourly tours examine
the exact location where Lana Tur-
ner’s charming young daughter gayly
stabbed Johnny Stompanato, Part
of this segment of the re-training
course involves viewing the film
which immortalized the crime:
“Where Love Has Gone.” It is worth
mentioning that Lana Turner de-
cline a starring role, with thanks.

The Lexington police force is in-
deed the best law enforcement north
of Dallas County, Alabama, and cer-
tainly east of the Mississippi. They
are brave and courageous men, and
they have our thanks. You find that
hard to believe? Then would you
believe the Maury River?

 

 

 

Faulty Equipment Blamed
For Lack of Response

The concert Saturday night with
Chuck Jackson was one of the best
ever seen on this campus. This judg-
ment is based on the way the au-
dience responded to the show. The
fact that he did not allow the faulty
microphones to outwardly bother
him helps to prove his ability as an
entertainer.

However, why should we have to
listen to expensive entertainment
through faulty equipment? It would
not be too much trouble to run a
thorough check on the equipment
the week before a concert. If this is
not standard practice, it should be.
There is no reason for either the
entertainer or the audience to suffer
the inconvience of bad microphones.

W&L Drops Its Second
Diamond Encounter, 4-0

By CHARLIE FRERET

Washington and Lee’s baseball
team was dealt its second loss and
whitewash of the season Friday as
they bowed to Hampden-Sydney, 4-
0. Pete Heumann started on the
mound for the Generals. Pete was
touched for five hits but shoddy
play by his teammates caused him to
suffer his second loss. Again also
it was the Generals lack of offense,
the inability to hit, which prevented
them from staging any sort of rally.
Jimmy Cooper and Bill Rasmussen
followed Pete to the mound. “Coop”
yielded one hit in three innings and
“Rass” gave up one hit also in the
inning he pitched.

Hampden-Sydney got on_ the
scoreboard in the third inning. Rob-
ertson, the rival pitcher, led off the
inning with a single to right field.
And when Skip Jacobson let the
ball roll through his legs, Robertson
continued around the bases. The Tig-
ers scored three more in the fifth on

three hits, a ball and an error
These runs proved insignificant as
Robertson was never in danger at

any time during the ball game.

Robertson yielded only two singles,
one to centerfielder Tom Mitchell
and the other to catcher Guy Town-
ley, while striking out eight. Robin-
also led the Tigers at the plate as
he collected two singles and a double,
and scored 2 runs.

Two factors have proved costly to
the Generals in their two games
their poor batting and fielding. The
Generals have collected 5 hits in
56 times at the bat for a team bat-
ting average of .090. Five different
plays have hits for W&L. And the

Dr. Erle Kauffman Speaks
On Principles of Evolution

Last Week In Howe Hall

how it has affected the rise and
development of animal species, in-
cluding man. Dr. Kauffman illustrat-
ed the principles of evolution by
examples of the development of cer-
tain extinct clams and oysters.

“Even the religious fundamental-

Lacrosse ‘“‘B” Squad Beats
AMA In Double Overtime

Coach Carroll Klingelhofer’s la-
crosse “B” team defeated Augusta
Military Academy in double over-
time 7-5 at AMA.

The Generals were down one point
in the fourth period when Alan Lee
came up with a clutch goal to tie
the game, 5-5, and sent it into over-
time.

The first overtime was scoreless.
Buddy Atkins on a fine individual
effort made the first score in the
second overtime period. Lars Holtan
put the game on ice on an alert play,
breaking up a clear.

Holtan had scored another goal
earlier in the game. Other Washing-
ton and Lee scoring was produced
by Joe Chadwick with two goals, and
Pete Nowick with one.

Klingelhofer commented that the
team didn’t play as well as in the
last week’s outing with AMA. “We
had our minds too much on Springs.
We controlled the ball most of the
game, but we missed too many
shots.

“We have a tough game with
Roanoke today. These two games
with Roanoke, this and next week’s,
are the key to the season.”

Trackmen Bite The Dust
83-61; Face Elon Next

Washington and Lee’s track team
was shut out of the jumping events
and the relays enroute to a 83'-
6112 defeat at the hands of Roanoke.

Freshman Earl Edwards was a
bright spot in a generally dismal af-
ternoon by copping two firsts, in the
shot put and in the discus.

Track team co-captain Lee John-
son, hampered by injuries for some
time, led Washington and Lee’s only
sweep, winning the two mile run. He
was followed by Generals Corbet
Bryant, Brad Shinkle, and Sean
O'Conner.

In the midst of a large scale re-
building year, the track team faces
Elon College at Wilson Field Thurs-
day. Saturday they travel to North
Carolina to participate in the David-
son Relays.

W&L Scoring

Generals taking first place against
Roanoke were: Javelin, John Myntti-
nen at 174.9; shot put, Edwards,
39-10; pole vault, Lawrence, 11-6;

Generals’ Comeback Falls
Short, Stickmen Loose, 6-5

By KIP ARMSTRONG

Before a large and enthusiastic
Spring’s weekend crowd, the General
stickmen played an exciting game
Saturday, but dropped a 6-5 decision
to the Tarheels of North Carolina.
The teams were very even and
showed scrappy and aggressive play
throughout, but four fast goals were
enough to provide the margin of vic-
tory.

In the second period, the visitors
tallied two goals within ten seconds,
and another two-goal flurry in the
third period game them a 6-3 lead
going into the final quarter. The
Generals outplayed the Carolina
team in the final minutes of the
contest, as they scored twice to
move within a single goal, but Car-
olina gained control and held on to
win,

Even Contest Praised

The statistics indicate the closeness
of the two teams, as both shots on
goal and ground balls were nearly
even, and the visiting netminder,
Harvey Stanley, made 19 saves to
13 for Dave Johnson, who again
was outstanding for the home team.
The finesse of both goalies excited
the crowd time and again as each
made many fine saves.

Coach Swan lauded the team ef-
fort and felt the game was as
evenly contested as any game the
W&L stickmen have played this sea-
son. He cited the Blue defensive
play, which paralyzed the settled
play of Carolina’s offense. Most of
the victory goals came on fast breaks
or when the Generals were a man
down.

Johnson and Bendann Mentioned

Dave Johnson paced the defense
with his saves in the goal, and co-

captain Bendann played his usual
fine game, turning in a number of
crowd-pleasing clears, while fresh-
man Charlie Stewart continued to

work well with the close defense.
Bruce Jackson paced the offense
with two goals and was effective

on both the midfield and attack.
Freshman Bart Goodwin played his
finest game and scored on a beau-
tiful shot after dodging a surprized
Tarhell defenseman. All the attack
played well and Pittman was quite
active around the crease.

Duke Next Opponent

The contest was the closest the
Generals have come to victory since
their initial 9-8 win over Villanova
and with a _ concentrated effort
against Duke at Durham on Wednes-
day, the varsity stickmen hope to
gain their second victory of the sea-
son.

College, adopted at that time with
the authorization of the Virginia
legislature, was continued until 1871,
shortly after the death of General
Lee, when the present corporate title,
Washington and Lee University, was
assumed.

Construction of the Washington
College building, central unit of the
present group of academic buildings,
was begun in 1824. Three gifts—the
donation from Washington, a con-
tribution of funds from the Society
of the Cincinnati in Virginia, and a
bequest from John Robinson, a na-
tive of Ireland, a soldier under
Washington, and later a trustee of

Brunswick, Maine, where they are
also on the faculty of the Bowdin
College Summer School of Music. In
August, they will present three con-
certs at the second annual Bowdoin
College Contemporary Music Festi-
val featuring the premieres of three
works written for the Players.
Pierrot Lunaire

Miss Howland has been applauded
by such reviews as Virgil Thomson
of the Herald Tribune for her
“thorough and straightforward artis-
try.” One of her most widely ac-
claimed recent interpretations, and
a work which she has recorded, is
that of Arnold Shoenberg’s “Pierrot
Lunaire” which Miss Howland has
performed in New York, Chicago,
Boston, Pittsburgh and Washington.

Tonight

A number of composers have writ-
ten works for the Players. One of
these, “Contra Mortem et Tempus,”
by George Rochberg will be present-
ed Tuesday evening.

The rest of the program includes
“Trio Sonata in B Minor” for flute,
Violin and continuo by K. P. E. Bach,
a selection from Louis Spohr’s Opus
103, for voice, clarinet, and piano,
and “Pierrot Lunaire,” Opus 21 by
Shoenberg.

financial collapse. Classes had been
discontinued shortly after the out-
break of the war, and most of the
students had enlisted in the Con-
federate army under the name of
the Liberty Hall Volunteers. The
college building had been seriously
damaged, and many of the books
had been taken from the library
when the Federal army occupied
Lexington in June, 1864.

The college being without income
from its endowment at the close of
the war, the trustees borrowed mon-
ey on their private credit for the
repair of the ‘buildings and began
the work of rehabilitation. About
thirty years afterward the Congress
of the United States granted re-
muneration to the institution for
the destruction of property by the
invading army.

Lee Offered Presidency

On August 4, 1865, the presidency
of this war-torn college was offered
to General Lee. It was not the only

nineteenth
century. These three endowments to-

The War Between the States left
the college nearly on the verge of

a five-year period during which the
development of the institution was
phenomenal.

Lee Brings Changes

While the enrollment was being
expanded during General Lee’s re-
gime drastic changes were made in
the curriculum. During the first
year of his administration, five new
departments of study in liberal arts
were added, and an elective system,
within prescribed limits, was intro-
duced in place of the traditional
course of study. Then in 1866 the
law school was added through an
alliance with the Lexington Law
School, which had been founded as
a private institution in 1849. In the
same year a School of Civil and
Mining Engineering was organized.
The next year the foundation for the
present School of Commerce and
Business Administration was laid
with the establishment of a “Stu-
dent’s Business School.”

Also in 1869 General Lee proposed
the establishment of instruction in
journalism, and the trustees approv-
ed his plan for granting fifty schol-
arships annually to young men “pro-
posing to make printing or journal-
ism their profession.” The trustees
agreed to establish a college print-
ing shop or to make arrangements
with an established newspaper for
instruction to be given the students.

 

offer made to the leader of the de-
feated Confederate armies. He had
recently refused an offer of an es-
tate and competence in England, the
post of commander-in-chief of a

,| foreign army, and the presidency of

a large life insurance company at
a salary of $50,000 a year. He had
declined the presidencies of two

other Southern universities and had
refused to write his memories for
a publishing company on the ground
that it might fan hostile embers
which he believed should cool as
soon as possible.

Because he had been excluded
from the terms of amnesty in the
proclamation of the President of

the United States on May 29, 1865,
he delayed accepting the appoint-
ment as president of Washington
College, fearing that he might draw
a feeling of hostility toward the
institution. On August 24, however,
he decided to accept and informed
the college with a letter.

General Lee was formerly installed
as president of the college on Octo-
ber 2, 1865, and held this position
until his death on October 12, 1870—

CAMPUS
FASHIONS

By CHIP TOLBERT
ESQUIRE’S FASHION EDITOR

E-A-S-T-E-R-T-1-M-E! The very word begins to echo through the
quadrangle like an ignited stick of dynamite. Whatever other con-
notations it may hold for you, Easter Vacation always comes as a
last-minute antidote through which you escape—just in the nick
of time—your impending nineteenth nervous breakdown and the
breakneck pace of academic life. So, on your mark, get set, GO!
Chances are you'll be going South where the Spring grass is green
and the tropic sunshine good and hot. Time, that is, for tips on
what to take along...

NASSAU, ANYONE? No doubt T.S. Eliot wasn’t
thinking of the Caribbean when he labeled April
the cruelest month—not by a long shot. There’s
Bermuda, sitting like ‘an emerald ina sapphire }
sea;” there’s Ft. Lauderdale, where the girls are
and where the boys follow after. On the West
Coast, there’s La Jolla, or for the way out

swingers, Newport Beach, And if you really
want to get away from it all, there’s Mexico

te ES)

City. But whether you find your pipe-dream nn 2 a volcano or
under a swaying palm, remember to play it safe. Take along at
least one dark suit, a lightweight polyester and wool or a cotton
blend. You never know when you might be invited up to the Gov-
ernor’s mansion for drinks on the patio.

FOR THAT SMART, young millionaire look, you couldn’t do better
than select your dress-up resort wear in Navy blue. Dark gray’s
okay, and olive will do, but royal Navy has a rich, crisp look college
men like. And, incidentally, there’s no time like the present to look
for a Permanent Press suit. It'll keep the wrinkles out as Summer

comes sailing in.

WEAR WITH IT, a white or pale tone button
down shirt. It may be striped (and here the
color scheme of things is getting bolder and
brighter every day), or a solid color. Best bets:
pale blue, pale lemon, pink, or a creamy tan
shade. The new Permanent Press dress shirts
are great for travel for obvious reasons: you
wash them out at night, and the next morning,
without ironing (or puckered seams) they're
back in perfect shape. Take along a couple of
ties: a bright, bold paisley, a repp stripe, and
make sure they sport the new, fashion-right,
wider widths.

MAKE THE CASUAL SCENE in a Madras or

polyester/cotten seersucker sport jacket. Hers,
your color and pattern choice may be as wild
as your taste permits. You'll need a pair of dark,
medium, or ight gray dress slacks, and your
choice should depend on coordination with the
jacket, Jeans or chinos, three or four pairs, low-

rise, hip-hugging, and tapered in faded blue or
a wheat color, are mandatory. Make sure they
have built-in wash-and-wear capabilities. Ditto
with your sport shirts. Select three or four in
the popular Henley style in lightweight woven
fabrics, and a couple of cotton/polyester knits.

ON THE BEACH let your imagination drift around the sand

castles, But before you make the beach scene, be sure you're equipped
with several new swim shorts. Big, splashy Hawaiian surfer trunks
(usually available with matching shirts), and the new Basketball
swim short styles will be among the most popular this season, Most
young men prefer them in trim, athletic, form-fitting models, and
the word for surfing '66 is COLOR. Bright, burning reds, vivid yel-
lows, flashy greens, and wild prints are the top contenders.

THE TWILIGHT CHILL calls for a couple of colorful sweatshirts,

and a bulky, loose-knit “Poor Boy” sweater. Sneakers and sandals
are a must, of course, but even more imperative are shades and a
good suntan lotion. Slip a pair of black loafers into your suitcase,
zip it up, check out your reservations, and be off!

 

NEXT MONTH, we'll survey Spring and Summer fashions in depth.
Meanwhile, give our regards to the gang, and make every moment
count, Smooth sailing...

meetings. A portion of this time may
be used for nominations if desired,
however total time will be three
minutes.

Class officers will be nominated
from the floor and will be permitted
to speak for two minutes. Part of this
time may also be used for the nomi-
nation, or the candidate may nomi-
nate himself.

Following these speeches there vill
be a primary election. In the =C
elections two candidates will be
elected from each class;the primary
will eliminate all but the four high-
est candidates. In the elections for
class officers, where one man is
elected, the primary will eliminate all
but the two highest candidates. The
only class officers to be elected are
the president and vice-president ex-
cept in the senior class where three
vice-presidnts will be elected.

Room at 7 p.m. on Monday, May 2,
to elect their representatives to the
EC. Following this election each class
will elect its own class officers. Nom-
inations will come from the floor and
a simple majority will be required to
win.

Revised Assimilation Policies
To Go Into Effect Immediately

Assimilation Committee Chair-
man Sam Frazier today stated that
the Executive Committee’s new rules
on assimilation will go into effect
immediately. The EC rules are as
follows:

(a) Students will appear before the
Assimilation Committee after that
committee receives one card with
that student’s name on it. Additional
cards received before the student's
actual appearance will not constitute
a separate offense. When the stu-
dent appears the first time the Com-
mittee will talk to him and ask
his future cooperation concerning
conventional dress. He will also be
warned that after five appearances
he will be referred to the Executive
Committee whose full range of power
will include a recommendation for
suspension. The second appearance
will bring a $1 fine and further dis-
cussion with the student. The third
appearance will bring a $2 fine. The
fourth appearance will bring a $3
fine and a final reminder that an
additional card will necessitate an
appearance before the Evecutive
Committee. The student's fifth ap-
pearance will be before the Execu-
tive Committee.

(b) An unexcused absence by a

Girls Arrested,
Fined $115 For
Mag Soliciting

Lexington police have announced
that they were able to secure the
arrest and conviction last week of
two salesgirls who were reportedly
“soliciting for magazine subscrip-
tions’ at various fraternity houses
and student apartments

Jeyce Hess, age 20, who gave her
address as 919 Kansas Street in Ar-
lington, and “Sherry Lee MeLain,”
22, also of the same address, were
charged on April 12th with a vioia-
tion of city statute section 15-34,
which prohibits soliciting for the sale
of magazine on private property in
Lexington. Miss “MeLain” was sub-
sequently charged, on the Mth, with
giving false information to a police
officer, when it was ascertained that
her name really is Gloria Denerich
and that lives in Catonsville,
Maryland. The arrests were made by
Lexington’s Lieutenant Kirby, on
the complaint of two WE&L students
whom the Department identified as
Cary Hansel and Edmund Burke

Both girls were brought to trial
on the day after their arrest, before

student who has been notified to ap-
pear before the Assimilation Com-
mittee will result in a $1 fine in ad-
dition to the normal fine he would
have received. After a third absence
the student will be referred to the
Executive Committee for disciplinary
action.

(ce) Gentiemanly attire is expected
from all students at all times.

(d) The Assimilation Committee
will use its own descretion regard-
ing any extenuating circumstances.

(e) Assimilation Committee mem-
bers will be active in assimilating
students and will encourage other
students to be active also.

Chairman Frazier commented that
these provisions “empower the As-

similation Committee to interpret
what does constitute gentlemanly
attire—whether, where, and when
some variation of conventional dress
might be appropriate. As a result,
the Committee has the flexibility to
both effectively and reasonably en-
force the system.”

“The extent to which this or any
Assimilation policy is felt depends
entirely on the attitude of the stu-
dents, however. We ask all students
to co-operate with conventional
dress and to give the new system
a chance to be fairly tested.”

Assimilation Committee boxes
are located in the Commons, in New-
comb, Washington, duPont halls, and
in the Law School.

 

 

Renaissance Theatre Authority
To Speak On Troubadours’ Play

Mr. Charles Raison, whom Troub-
adour director Lee Kahn calls “as
much of an authority as there is in
this country” on the Italian Ren-
aissance commedia delfarte theater,
will speak at W&L Monday night in
connection with the forthcoming
Troub production of The Three
Cuckolds.

The commedia was one of the chief
ancestors of the modern theater. It
is little known today, since it was
the one major theater form which
was never performed from an actual
script; all plays were improvised
from a bare plot outline and a
stockpile of comic situations and
characters

The Three Cuckolds is a recon-
struction from one of the surviv-
ine scenarios of what the final result
must have been like. It concerns the
activities of the prankster Arlec-
chino, played in this production by
di ¥ Cady.

Arlecchino the three old
men of the title (Lew Davis, Even
Jeffries, and Lock Handley) in ear-

assists

rying on affairs with one another's

wives (Mrs. Rebert Rushing, Mrs
Royster Lyle, and Mrs. John Evans)
In doing so, he locks one up in a
chest, persuades another to have
all his teeth pulled, and convinces
the third that his wife can bear him
a child simply by digging in the
ground while reciting incantations in
Latin

While eulstandingly successful in
feoling the old men, however, Arlec-
chino is endlessly frustrated in his
attempts, as he puts it, “to win for

myself a bit of the dessert.” In the
end all three husbands are reunited
with thei proper wives while

Iman Jeb Brown, and one of the most

h=i

unusual devils in all of literature is
portrayed by Tim Webster.

The reason for sponsoring a lec-
ture on the commedia before the
production, according to Mr. Kahn,
is the unfamiliarity of the form to
American audiences. “This is a very
funny and very bawdy play,” he
says, “but makes use of conventions
of which most people are not aware.

Self-Study Sets
Open Hearings

On Fraternities

Dean Lewis G. John, analyst for
the Self-Study report section deal-
with student life at Washington and
Lee, will conduct open hearings on
Tuesday, April 26, on the topic of
“social fraternities.”

The meeting for students is sched-
uled for 3:15 p.m. in Newcomb 8,
and the faculty session is scheduled
for 7:30 p.m. in the same room.

A summary of questions and sug-
gestions relative to fraternities has
been distributed to the faculty and
to the student leadership (execu-
tive committee, fraternity presidents,
and newspaper editors). Copies of
the summary are available to other
students in Mr. Parsons’ office on the
third floor of Washington Hall.

The summary contains such ques-
tions as “Do fraternities hinder the
University in carrying out its major
objective?”; “Would some alternative
system—e.g., elimination of frater-
nities, 100% fraternity membership
(‘total opportunity’), some form of
deferred rush—be both feasible and
beneficial?”; and “Can the position
of fraternity housemothers at Wash-
ington and Lee be improved?”

Among the recommendations are
that “fraternities should be required
to utilize on a regular basis the ser-
vices of local Certified Public Ac-
countants”; several proposals are also
included on actions that fraternities
can take to improve themselves.

Because of the importance of fra-
ternities in student life at Washing-
ton and Lee, the Self-Study Com-
mittee appointed a special subcom-
mittee to conduct an intensive study
of problems affecting fraternities and
their relationships with the Univer-
sity. Chairman of the subcommittee
was Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw and the
membership consisted of both fac-
ulty and students. The subcommittee
devoted almost a full year to its
investigation.

The report of the subcommittee
has been received by the Self-Study

Committee. Following Dean John's

(Continued on Page 4)

*be made within the existing build-
ings to accommodate increased facil-
ities.

Among the proposals made in the
tentative blueprints were the follow-
ng:

—the main floor of the present
Student Union would remain bas-
ically unchanged. However, a library
would replace the large meeting
room, containing paperback books,
magazines, desks, and lounge chairs,
while pay telephone booths will be
placed in what is now an empty side
entrance hall.

—the basement of the Student
Union would be given over to sound-
proof muise practice rooms, with
the Calyx office moving to the third
floor.

—a large portion of the present
co-op area would be made an execu-
tive committee room with adjoining
witness rooms and a storeroom. This
section would also have a separate
outside entrance.

—the lower level of the Co-op,
which now contains the book store,
would be given over to pool tables
and perhaps other recreational facili-
ties.

The new structure between the
already-existing buildings would
contain the majority of the facilities
being planned. On the main floor,
which would be on the present
ground level, would be:

—a Chapel and Chaplain’s Office,
situated on either side of the re-
cessed main entrance.

Notes and Comment

The Administration, which has been cooperating with the
student body extensively in preparation for the upcoming
Selective Service Qualification Tests, has had to re-schedule
the E-hour exams scheduled originally for Saturday the 21st,
to Friday afternoon, the 20th. Such a change may be incon-
venient to several students; however, there was no alternative.
You can’t fight city hall; who wants to try the White House?
Like oil and water, the draft test and academic exams just
don’t mix. We can only be (relatively) appreciative that the

exam period was left alone to the extent it was.

While on the subject, it appears to us that the draft test
is something which ought to be taken by all even if a good
time can’t be had. True, there IS a natural antipathy to having
the local SS board even LOOK at individual files; there ARE
the customary rumors that the test will be weighted to the ad-
vantage of math and science students. But other factors ought
to be taken into consideration—such as Dean Atwood’s obser-

President-Elect Jeffress Cites Attitude
And Sets 1966-1967 EC Policy Guides

By BILL JEFFRESS
EC President-Elect

The Executive Committee in 1965-
66 has come of age, not only as an
organ of student government but
also as an instrument of student
opinion and initiative. The change,
I believe, has been subtle and has
not been heralded by momentous
accomplishments or by a flurry of
action. The change is one of attitude,
and is best illustrated by the view-
points expressed by all the candi-
dates in last week’s election. The
lackluster character of the election
no doubt obscurred the nature of this
change, but it becomes clear in com-
paring the attitudes and perform-
ances of Executive Committees prior
to this year. The change is from a
concern solely with “student affairs”
to a real and honest concern with
the problems and the potential of the
university itself,

Under the inspired and progres-

sive leadership of Fred Mindel, the
Executive Committee has begun in
certain areas to question existing
policies and attitudes and to seek
{new ideas and solutions which are
meant to improve the functions of
Washington and Lee as an educa-
tional institution. This atmosphere
of concern has been shown also by
the recent series in the Ring-tum
Phi on “What W&L Lacks Most.”
It has been shown by the initiative
of students in seeking to achieve
the integration of the university, mo-
tivated in many cases not so much
by an egalitarian social philosophy
as by a sincere desire to solve one
of W&L’s biggest immediate prob-
lems. The concern also is evident in
the motivation of students such as
Jim Awad in developing and bringing
forth the Independent Study idea as
a possible program for the encour-
agement of academic responsibility.
All of these examples serve to show

 

an increasing involvement by many

 

students in the welfare of the univer-
sity, but, unfortunately, this attiude
is not yet broadly based among the
student body.
Privilege, Not a Right

During the campaign last week, I
made the statement in the Ring-tum
Phi that the students are the most
important element at a school such
as Washington and Lee, and for this
reason the students can and should
play an active role in helping both
the curricular and extracurricular
policies of the university. This role,
however, is not a right but a privi-
ilege which must be earned and
maintained by the expression and
demonstration of real student con-
cern in making sincere efforts to
work with the faculty for construc-
tive changes. The Executive Com-
mittee, I believe, occupies a unique
position in having not only the op-
portunity but also the responsibility
to generate these efforts and devel-
op this student concern.

 

With this general theme in mind,
I want to examine three areas in
which I see problems which lend
themselves to study and action by
the Executive Committee in the
coming year, and to suggest some
of the solutions to be considered.

Exchange of Ideas

The first of these areas is student
involvement in the educational pro-
cess, Washington and Lee, as a small
university with a low students-to-
faculty ratio, offers an enormous op-
portunity for discussion and ex-
change of ideas between students,
either individually or in small
groups, and professors. Such ex-
change can be in many cases as im-
portant an educational method as are
lecture classes, and it certainly de-
velops in the student the capacity
to communicate and express his
ideas in a way that very few class-
es, excluding some seminars, can.
The opportunity, however, is not

vation that no W&L student should do poorly on the test (can
he say as much for exams?) ; such as Mr. Hershey’s decree
that local boards will not have to use the test results to any
specific degree; such as—most important—the Damoclean
sword handing over the students’ collective head that the class
rank requirements (i.e., upper fourth, half, two-thirds) may
change at any moment. A similar Korean War draft test was
kind to our school; at any rate, the most medicore W&L 18-
to-26-year-old student should compare more than favorably
with the City College valedictorian.

= fF oe

In its ‘Report to the Faculty and Students,”’ the Self-Study
group’s Subcommittee on Fraternities offers several “questions

taken advantage of as it could and
should be. Discussion and controver-
sy are often minimized, and although
there is a very pronounced aca-
demic atmosphere, there is a lack of
real exchange of thought and ideas,
Perhaps part of the lack of in-
tellectual controversy can be traced
to the fraternity system and the
homogeniety of the student body, but
there are ways in which we ean
develop and encourage close student-
faculty exchange, through a meth-
od along the lines of the Princeton
“preceptorial” concept and / or
through the use of informal evening
discussion meetings held indepen-
dently of the regular curriculum.

Generals Win, Lose
In Diamond Action

By RON KESSLER

Washington and Lee’s baseball
team broke even this week, de-
feating Lynchburg College Tuesday,
7-6, and dropping one to Bridge-
water yesterday, 2-0.

The Lynchburg game, W&L’s first
victory of the season, was won in
the ninth inning on a squeeze play
by Tom Mitchell scoring pinch-run-
ner Gil Turner.

Lynchburg jumped ahead early
in the game, scoring one in the first
inning and one in the second while
the Generals went scoreless. But
W&L exploded in the fourth, scoring
four runs on base hits by Eric Sis-
ler, Skip Jacobson and Ed Bishop
and a double by Jim Wilson.

The Generals scored another in
the fifth on singles by Sisler and
Luke Crosland, but Lynchburg came
back with four in the sixth on five
walks and two hits to go ahead 6-5.

Replacing starter Jim Cooper in
the sixth inning, Pete Heumann
bore down and held Lynchburg to
one hit for the remainder of the
game. Ed Bishop led off the ninth
by getting on base on an error by
the shortstop, followed by John
Wolf's single to left. Heumann struck
out, but Gil Fitzhugh singled to left
to score Bishop. Turner, running
for Wolf, then scored the winning
run on Mitchell’s well-placed bunt.

Eric Sisler led the team at bat,
going 3 for 4 and scoring one run.
Heuman got credit for the wins as he
gave up one hit and one walk in
the three and one-third innings.

In a not-so-funny comedy of er-
rors W&L lost to Bridgewater Col-
lege, 2-0. The scoring occurred in
the fourth on back-to-back erors
by Sisler and Fitzhugh followed by

 

Track Team Takes 12 Of
17 Events To Batter Elon
In Season’s Second Win

By NEIL KESSLER

Yesterday on Wilson Field the
Washington and Lee track team “put
a smile on the face of our score-
book” (Coach Lord), by trouncing
Elon College 92 to 53 for their sec-
ond win of the outdoor season,

W&L trailed in the meet by as
much as 11 points but swept the
880, pole vault, triple jump, and two-
mile to forge ahead. Of the seven-
teen events held yesterday W&L
lost only five

Pacing the Generals in the victory
were Bill Wildrick, Wes Murfin and
Moby Dowler in the 880; Ned Law-
rence, Ned Crossman, and Gary
Wilkinson in the pole vault; Nelson

Head, Dave Crawley, and Dave
Thornton in the triple jump; and
Lee Johnson, Brad Shinkle, and

Corbet Bryant in the two-mile.

Other first-place winners include
Rick Mynttinen in the javelin, Bob
Stack in the mile, and Jim Thomp-
son in the half-mile. Dave Ennis
and Jeff Kugel took firsts in the
hurdles, while Earl Edwards won the
discus throw.

Next Friday the W&L thinclads
face a strong Old Dominion team on
Wilson Field. This weekend 16 track
and field men travel to Davidson
College to participate in the David-
son Relays, where they are ex-
pected to make a strong showing

Coach Lord has announced that
there will be a mandatory meeting
of the top 20, Monday night at 7:30

in the projection room in the base-
ment of the gym

two singles to right. The Generals’
only threat came in the second in-
ning when Bishop advanced to sec-
ond on a single by Wolf, but pitch-
er Bill Rasmussen grounded out to
retire the side.

Rasmussen pitched a fine game,
giving up five hits, one walk, and
no earned runs. According to coach
Lyles, “Rasmussen should have won
this one.”

W&L’'s main problem this season
has been hitting. Through the Bridge-
water game, the team’s average has
been .125, Fielding also has room
for improvement, with 15 errors in
three games. However, as coach
Lyles put it, “the team is looking
better every game. Our pitches have
been working hard. If we can keep
up our pitching and start hitting, we
should start to win some ball games.
We have a young team—three-fourth
are freshmen and sophomores. It will
take time, but I’m confident.”

The team travels to Richmond
Wednesday to meet RPI, and plays
Old Dominion here next Saturday.

Desire Pays Off For Generals, Says Swan

 

The varsity lacrosse team defeated
Duke in a spirited and hotly con-
tested game at Durham Wednesday
by taking control early in the first
period, and finishing strong. The
visiting Generals gained their vic-
tory, the second of the season, 9-6.

Coach Dana Swan cited this game
as simply a case of the team with
the greater desire to win emerging
victorious . The Generals capitalized
on chances four times in the first
period and seemed to have be-
gun a rout, but Duke stormed back
in the second period to close to
within two goals as they controlled
the ball and repeatedly fed their big
mid-fielder, Andy Beath.

In the second half, the Generals
began to retrive more ground balls
and again took charge. Bruce Jack-
son paced the offense, as he has
done all season, with two tallies in
the fourth period, one a hard ground
shot from his mid-field position and

the other coming from a move
around the crease.
The decisive factor was Blue's

clearing, which was the best of the
season. Goalie Dave Johnson was
most effective in the goal, with 17
saves, and out of it, as he found his
defensemen easily on clears and fre-
quently ran the ball to midfield him-
self,

The Generals, though outshot 44
to 36, had the edge in ground balls
53 to 44. This was the most balanced

tion of Springs
Weekend, or for
that matter any
big weekend.

Think _ back.
Have you ever |
heard mike troub- |
les at any Univer- |
sity Assembly?
Have you ever
really heard any
university assem-
bly?

Unoffical polls on both questions
have yielded two “No” answers,
though for some reason more peo-
ple answered the second question
in the negative than the first.

Now think back to our concerts.
Have you ever heard a W&L con-
cert without mike trouble? Have
you ever been sober enough to real-
ly hear a concert?

Again the polls have returned ne-
gative answers. What we can’t un-
derstand is the fact that the major-
ity of the answers to the second
question were to the effect that
concerts start too early and the reg-
ulations are too strict.

Why, then, must we suffer through
audio lapses at every concert? They
are enjoyed by neither the students,
nor their dates, nor the entertain-
ers. What a wonderful tradition!

Speaking of traditions, the Mets
seem to be undergoing some sort of
metamorphosis. The Old Man is
gone, and so is the hopelessness of

But as Jimmy Breslin, the author
of Can Anybody Here Play This
Game?, has just said: The Mets now
face the danger of becoming just
mediocre instead of terrible. That
could hurt both their image and their
attendance.

Staying with baseball for a few
more lines, the Dodgers are hanging
in there so far without much help
from the Dandy Duo. When they get
warmed up, the rest of the National
league will be in for trouble.

What has gotten into the Dodgers
is beyond belief. They’ve actually
started hitting. Everybody knows
just how long that will hold up, but
if their season average ends up
above .255, they’ll finish first again.

Incidentally, overheard the other
day: What do you mean ‘Who is
going to win the American League?’
I only follow the Majors!

Jeffress: Proposes EC Activity

(Continued from page 2)
reason the newly elected Executive
Committee will in May again review
the “Traditions Committee” idea in
determining policy on enforcement
of traditions. Hopefully, we will
bring into being a committee based
on encouragement rather than en-
forcement of tradition.

Student Involvement

The third area that merits our
attention is that of student involve-
ment in the affairs of the student
government itself. The attenion giv-
en the recent election of student
body officers can be described at
the very best as disappointing, but
I realize and regret that the lack
of opposition for the top spot was a
prime cause of this apathy. What dis-
turbs me more is the lack of interest
shown in such things as the ODK
Forum discussion on the NSA ques-
tion and in the open student meet-
ings on the self-study reports. I
hope, through increased and more
effective use of the ODK Forum, and
through increased freshman orien-
tation in functions of the student

government, to alleviate the problem
to a degree, but the impetus here
must ultimately come from the stu-
dents ourselves.

These three areas are by no menas
the only ones that the EC will be
examining in the coming year. I
intend to work for a Junior Year
Abroad program, for a “curriculum
committee” of students to take a
role in matters directly affecting the
curriculum in cooperation with the
faculty, and for the current pro-
posal of the Independent Study Pro-
gram. Finally, although I _ see
little role for the EC as a body in
this area, I intend to work whole-
heartedly to the full extent of my
resources for the integration of
Washington and Lee.

I hope that all these problems and
suggested plans of action will be
actively discussed in the upcoming
class elections, and that students
will make their choices for class
officers on the basis of their own
concept of the role the EC should
play as an organ of student initiative

 

in the coming year.

 

Professors Criticize’ Viet Policy

The mistakes outlined by Dr.
Caughlin, who formerly taught at
Yale and Toronto Universities, has
been vice-counsel in Saigon and has
done some research in Bangkok,
were four in number. He said our
first mistake was in supporting the
French in Indo China against the
nationalists. Our second was made
when we did not press for the free
elections called for by the Geneva
Convention and backed Ngo Dinh
Diem. Then we supported Diem
when his popularity decayed, making
our third mistake. The fourth mis-
take we are making right now. It

is our present policy in Viet Nam.
Dr. Caughlin declared it was a
“gross” error to pound hell out of
North Viet Nam.” We can do nothing
by backing “paper premiers” and
refusing to deal with the Viet Nam.

Dr. Caughlin remarked that our
distinetion between communist and
nationalist in the struggle is a false
one. He indicated that the follows
of Ho Chi Minh were more nation-
alistic than the Saigon government.
To the Viets, Ho Chin Minh is a
nationalist first, much like Robert E.
Lee, Dr. Caughlin said. The leader-
ship of Viet Nam cannot be made
in Washington or Saigon. It must be
made by the Vietnamese people.
Help from outside is only resented
by these people.

Montgomery, Saunders Head Ring-tum Phi

The publications Board elected the
editors and business managers of the
Ring-tum Phi and the Southern Col-
legian at its meeting yesterday in
the Student Union. A photography
editor was not selected due to the
absence of applicants.

Warren Monutgomery, a rising
senior Sigma Chi from Memphis,
Tennessee, and Steve Saunders, a

rising junior SPE from Elmont, New
York, were chosen editors of the
1966-67 Ring-tum Phi. New business
manager for the campus newspaper
will be Bob Priddy, senior Phi Kap
from Richmond, Va.

Jim Crothers, KA from Rising
Sun, Md., and Tox Cox, Phi Kap
from Richmond, Va., were selected
for the positions of editor and busi-
ness manager of the Collegian re-
spectively. No other decision was
made regarding the Collegian. Drew

 

Baur, former editor and current
president of the Publications Seiad,"
is due to speak at the next Faculty |

meeting to urge reconsideration of |
the decision to cut off Collegian
funds,

The appointment of Saunders was
a marked departure from past prac-
tice, which dictated that only ris- |
ing seniors be considered for Editor-
in-Chief of the 65-year-old Ring-
{um Phi, It is only the third time
in thirty years that a rising junior |
has been elected.

Montgomery served this past se-
mester on the Friday staff as feature |
Editor. A geology major, he spent
two semesters on a Pacific cruise
as part of a Columbia University |
scientific expedition, returning in|
January 1966. Montgomery also has |
served as house manager for his

A Quick Response

The proposed amendment to the student body constitu-
tion permitting write-in candidates is precisely the revision we
called for last week. If adopted this amendment will not elimi-
nate the petition requirement, but it will insure that every vote
cast for a candidate will be counted as valid.

In our view this amendment contains an essential reform.
The fact that our constitution does not provide for write-in
candidates indicates a degree of irresponsibility on the part of
its authors. The time is certainly long past for a complete
evaluation of the student body constitution to include cor-
rections and additions. The last revision of this document was
made in September, 1962, which unfortunately resulted in
a number of technical errors as well as structural inadequacies.

Although the Executive Committee endorsed unanimously
this proposed amendment, it still requires a simple majority
of the entire membership of the student body. Members of
the student body will be given the opportunity of enacting this
reform during class elections next Monday. We wish to urge
the passage of this revision in the interests of a more democrat-

ic election procedure.

 

Congratulations!

Congratulations to the new editors and business managers
of the Ring-tum Phi and the Southern Collegian. The publica-
tions Board faced with an unusually large number of well qual-
ified applicants, had a particularly difficult time making a final
decision. We trust that the new editors will be able to carry out
their programs for next year, and continue to provide a repre-

sentative student forum.

 

Rider Views Liberal Man,
One Who Has Eye Trouble

By BRUCE W. RIDER

This week, if you are still with us,
we will present Part Two of our
exciting series on
_ conservatives and

liberals. A careful
reading of last
week’s column will
show that we dis-
cussed the conser-
_ vative man. Thus
it seems only fair
and right (or left)
that we take a lit-
tle look at the
liberal in this, the
concluding portion
of our lucid study.

The liberal man is on the left
because when he gets his way noth-
ing is left to individual initiative. Un-
like the conservative, the liberal
is full of imaginative plans for the
immediate improvement of all man-
kind; New Deal, New Frontier, Great
Society. (The liberal is called ‘liberal’
because he has to be liberal with
everybody's money to pay for all of
these schemes.)

It must be noted that liberals
are very poor mathematicians. Very
few, if any, liberals have figured
out that to get one dollar back from
Washington you have to send three.

Liberals, as opposed to conserva-
tives, don’t mind people who are
different from themselves. They are
often willing to learn from such peo-
ple. For example, liberals have ob-
served good Moslems praying to-
ward Mecca each day. A good lib-
eral does the same, except that he
bows and prays toward Washington.

A liberal is much like a maiden
Aunt. Always so interested in other
people's affairs and wanting se much
to help .

Liberals have alsolutely no sense
of the past. Before the liberal him-

 

self came upon the scene, nothing
had ever been done to lessen pov-
erty and ignorance. Things must be
corrected now, at once, by a Federal
plan. (The liberal is called a man
of the ‘left’ also because after all
of these great plans are paid for no-
body will have any money left.)

A liberal just can’t let anything
be. “We have to integrate. We have
to educate. We have to eradicate.”
It is tempting to wonder just why
the hell these people care so much.

The conscience of the liberal is
very, very tender. A man of another
hue living a thousand miles away
who is denied a cup of coffee—what
anguish this causes the liberal. Not
only that: he thinks (would you be-
lieve it?) that it is his own fault.

The liberal has taken upon him-
self the sins of the world. The uni-
verse is a mess—and the liberal
feels guilty because it is. Therefore
he rolls up the sleeves of his ex-
pensive shirt and Gives of Himself
to eradicate the ills of man. Today.
Tomorrow for sure.

One of the physical ailments of
the liberal concerns his sight. He is
far-sighted. Thus he can live in New
York and see clearly the social
wrongs in Alabama and feel he must
go there right away to set things
straight. His eye trouble keeps him
from seeing that something is rotten
in the state of New York.

Our two-party study of conserva-
tives and liberals now concludes. We
might note that these two kinds of
people do have something in com-
mon: while the conservative fears
the liberal who may be hiding under
his bed, so too does the liberal fear
the conservative who may be under
his bed.

Only the moderate gets a good

 

night's sleep.

Independent Study Plan and Flexible Exam Schedule Favored

 

Rick Carson

Any candidate for a representa-
tive office must recognize two very
basic things at the outset—his pre-
rogatives and his limitations, which
are established by the responsibilities
inherent in the office. As a candidate
for the Executive Committee, I be-
lieve and believe firmly in my ability
to recognize these boundaries, and
therefore, to be an able representa-
tive for the class of ’69.

My prerogatives and my respon-
sibilities cannot be separated, though,
because each is a principle of the
other. For example, it is my pre-
rogative to vote as I see most fit,
but this prerogative is accompanied
by my responsibility which I have to
allow the opinion of the majority of
the class to decide how “I see most
fit.” Other of my prerogatives, each
accompanied by a responsibility, in-
clude the interpretation of issues as
I understand them, presuming my-
self to be worthy of judging my
peers in the event of an Honor Trial,
and, perhaps, encompassing more
than any of the others, having con-
fidence in my ability to be an ex-
emplary representative of my class
and of my college. And if I did not
feel as I do regarding these pre-
rogatives and responsibilties, I would
not contend for your vote.

To be more specific, my platform
consists of two cardinal principles:
the preservation of our traditions,
and more student freedoms. I believe
in conventional dres, I practice con-
ventional dress, and I encourage all
students at Washington and Lee to
do the same. Note that I said en-
courage, not force. 1 make this dis-
tinction because I don’t believe a
tradition can be perpetuated by coer-
cion. As for student freedoms, I ad-
vocate among other things a more
flexible exam schedule, more student
determination in the choice of cours-
es, freer use of the Student Union
facilities, and most important of all,
the encouragement to all students to
implement their opportunities in the
Self-Study Program.

In effect, I stand for liberal legis-
lature for the benefit of the stu-
dents, conservative principles be-
cause we have something worth con-
serving, and sound reasoning to
govern all my actions because if
elected, Washington and Lee reflects
in part my decisions.

 

Doug Hall

Throughout this year we have been
bombarded with articles stressing
what is wrong with Washington and
Lee. I think self-criticism is a good
thing and is necessary for our im-
provement, but I would like condi-
tions to provoke a series of articles
on what is right with Washington
and Lee.

The Executive Committee has an
integral part in controlling these
conditions. Since this committee rep-
resents an increased amount of stu-
dent interest, I think it should be
given more of a chance to work
with the administrators in forming
the policy of the school. This would
not only increase the importance of
student opinion but would also help
the student-faculty relationship. I
believe that increased attention paid
to the students by the faculty will re-
sult in important cooperative de-
velopment.

The following are a few of the
ideas that I think should be given
careful consideration by the E.C.
next year: the adoption of an Inde-
pendent Study Program; a regular
lecture series by our own professors;
a more flexible exam schedule; and
the possibility of having a reading
week preceding exams.

I believe the acceptance of these
proposals would pave the way to
a more cohesive and progressive
university.

Sam Hinkle

As president-elect Bill Jeffress
put it, the Executive Committee and
the student body have come of age.
Part of that new maturity is en
awareness of Washington and Lee's
weaknesses as an instrument of edu-
cation. It is time to commit ourselves
to action. We, as students, murt take
a responsible, critical attitude to-
ward Washington and Lee. Our goals
should include an active Executive
Committee to present student views
effectively.

The most important qualification
for an E.C. representative is his at-
titude. The student body's new
awareness should be encouraged vig-
orously, As evidence of my posi-
tion on student affairs, I offer these
proposals for consideration

One ungraded class per semester
should be offered. This is a needed
relief from the present grade-con-

 

 

scious system, and an encouragement

of learning for learning’s sake. Our
grading system needs revision to in-
clude pluses. A student committee
should be organized to work with
the faculty in evaluating teachers
and courses of study. Too many
classrooms are locked each_ night.
This valuable study space should
be made available to the students.

A project I have worked on this
year is a flexible exam and hour
quiz schedule, where no one is
forced to take two exams in conse-
cutive exam periods or two hour
quizzes on the same day. I would
like to carry that work to comple-
tion. Next year, polls conducted by
the E.C. should be binding. Care
will be taken to word ballots clearly,
so there will be no misunderstanding
by the E.C. or the faculty what the
students want.

The Executive Committee should
develop a feasible plan to eliminate
Saturday classes and present it to the
administration. Perhaps continued
agitation will achieve results. The
presidents and vice-presidents of
the classes should be encouraged to
assume more leadership in student
affairs. Candidates for these offices
have campaigned on such a platform
for years. With cooperation from the
E.C., improvement is possible in this
area. We need a vigorous student
government. I would like to take
part in creating it.

Fran Lawrence

Washington and Lee has a proud
past and nationally famous tradi-
tions. And yet, like so many other
members of our class, the Class of
1969, I cannot disregard the future,
I cannot accept W&L only for what
it was or what it is now. Next year’s
E.C., and indeed next year’s sopho-
more class, must lead the student
body in reevaluatiing old values and
solving old problems. In short, we
must ask WHY? WHY is there stu-
dent apathy in almost every phase
of campus life? WHY is there a gap
between what student leaders feel
is best for the university and what
the administration feels is best?
WHY is there a growing discontent
in the student body because of in-
ability to express and effect its
ideas?

The answer to these and many
other problems can be found through
careful evaluation, through asking
WHY. And, where change is de-
manded, change must come. I do not
advocate blind and irrational change,
or change for changes sake. Rather,
we must first continue the work of
certain members of the 1965-66 E.C.
and the LF.C. in a thorough exam-
ination of every phase of W&L life.
A complete knowledge of the prob-
lems can give us insight into possible
solutions. But, these solutions must
be tried. They must not go the way
of N.S.A., of girls in the upperclass
dorms, of liquor at university dances,
of a needed and demanded substitute
for the Assimilation Committee. They
must not take the path Independent
Study is already on.

We cannot constantly strive to
maintain the status quo. We cannot
continue to believe “It is therefore it
is right.” Washington and Lee to re-
main the outstanding small college
it has been must once again be a
leader among colleges. We must
initiate new ideas in education and
student life that others strive to
emulate, not wait for another uni-
versity to hand it proven idea over
to us. Let us not ask whether an
has been proven. Rather, let us prove
it.

I stand for ideas based on an ex-
amination of present institutions;
strengthening those worthwhile, re-
viving from the past those we might
well use today and discarding those
no longer beneficial or effective.

John Schechter

The Executive Committee must
serve as a backbone for the student
body. It must be flexible and respon-
sive to new and original ideas while
at the same time sturdy and rigid
in presenting its policies, thoughts,
eriticism, and recommendations to
the administration.

One of the major concerns of the
EC is the fostering of student in-
terest and concern in University af-
affairs. The Executive Committee
should strive for more participation
in and support of the ODK forum.
I propose that the E.C, minutes be
mimeographed with copies made
avalible in the Student Union. This
would serve in addition to those al-
ready posted on the colonnade.

 

Copies of the student body constitu-
tion should be given to incoming

 

freshmen and made available to
students throughout the school year.
Open E.C. meetings should receive
more publicity through such media
as the Ring-tum Phi, posters, and
notices on the E.C. bulletin board.

The E.C. should be receptive to
new ideas and willing to explore any
conceivable possibilities towards nec-
essary changes. I strongly support a
Junior Year Abroad program. A cur-
riculum committee should be es-
tablished to express student opin-
ion on courses and grading. I feel
there should be a more flexible
policy toward both final exams and
and hour quizzes.

With an informed student body
comes a concerned student body and
a concerned student body promotes
an active Executive Committee.

John Thiemeyer

In running for the E.C., I wish
to present a platform resting on four
fundamental concerns. First, as Vice-
President of the freshman class, I
established, with the aid of some two
dozen other boys, a Pep Club whose
objective is to gain support for
activities representative of W&L
and particular W&L athletics. Plans
are being made for next football
season for a regular schedule of
rallies prior to home games, the
organization of cheering sections
at games, and the introduction of
bugles, cowbells, and garbage cans
(stimulated with sticks) as aids to
cheerleaders.

Second, I propose a review of the
endowment program. Even in view of
W&L’s financial limitations resulting
from the fact that we are not a
state school and from the necessary
depreciation of such things as the
admissions program and maintain-
ence; W&L stands in depressing con-
trast to many schools of her caliber
with regard to athletic and dormitory
facilities.

Third, I would work toward closer
ties between the E.C. and students.
This objective could be accomplish-
ed by the introduction of student
subcommittee made up of students
and one (or more) E.C. member.

Finally, I advocate development of
the Student Union. This proposal,
not to be confused with a de-empha-
sis of the fraternity complex which
is essential to W&L, would see the
development of more recreational
facilities and a review of the “women
in the dorms” controversy.

Pleas Geyer

When one thinks of the Executive
Committee, its duties as an honor
tribunal are usually foremost in one’s
mind. This is probably due to the un-
fortunate fact that, in the past, the
Executive Committee has been little
else. It is my belief, however, that
the execution of justice under the
honor system is only a small, albeit
exceedingly important, facet of the
Executive Committe’s obligation to-
ward the student body of Washing-
ton and Lee, for the E.C. should
also be an active legislative body,
proposing reasonable and much
needed reforms in academic, social,
and traditional matters and subse-
quently working diligently with the
administration for their implementa-
tion.

In the academic realm, such ob-
jectives as liberalization of penalties
for overcutting and the creating of a
faculty-student board to hear appeals
on behalf of students who have over-
cut would be worthy of considera-
tion. Also deserving investigation are
the proposals concerning ungraded
courses, independent study (on an
optional, rather than compulsory
basis), and a junior year abroad.

As for social reform, the E.C.
should work for the speedy crea-
tion of sorely needed lounge facil-
ities and probe into the practicality
of reasonable dormitory visiting
hours. In this area also, the E.C,
should enthusiastically support such
projects as the construction of the
new Student Union which would fa-
cilitate the establishment of better
relations between the fraternity and
non-fraternity men at Washington
and Lee and, therefore, create a bet-
ter integrated, more harmonious, and
more efficient student body.

Lastly the E.C. should be gravely
concerned by the perilous state of
Washington and Lee's unique, and I
believe, valuable traditions. Moder-
ate changes in this area could quite
possibly save them from imminent
extenction. Conventional dress, for
instance, could be made less odious
and more practical by the broadening
of definition during the hot fall
and spring months. At the same time,
the Executive Committee should try
diligently to revive a tradition which
has already succumbed—the Seuth-
ern Collegian. Perhaps the Collegian

did at times overstep the limits of

 

Freshman EC Candidates Reveal Platforms

endurance, but it did not deserve
the hasty and summary liquidation it
received. A referendum on the ques-
tion would undoubtedly be valuable
in persuading the administration
to reconsider and should be con-
ducted by the Executive Committee.

 

Roddy Roediger

During the past year the most
disappointing thing which I have
noted concerning the Executive
Committee is its lack of direet con-
tact with the students. I have talked
to many people who have very sound
ideas, but no way to express them.
I believe that the representatives on
the Executive Committee should
make a more pronounced effort to
keep in touch with the students that
they represent and find out what
they are thinking.

There are a number of things
which I personally believe could
be done to improve both the intel-
lectual and social atmosphere at
Washington and Lee. Chief among
these is the new independent study
plan which has already been worked
out by the Executive Committee.
This plan, if used correctly, would
greatly improve the academic at-
mosphere and would probably be-
come the school’s most outstanding
academic characteristic. Another
thing badly needed here is a reform
in the University Cooperative.

A new building is being built, but
the main thing that needs changing
is the management. As everyone
knows, the textbook prices are out-
rageous and the selection of paper-
back books is miserable. One thing
which is needed for social improve-
ment is the elimination of Saturday
classes on big dance weekends. An-
other is the reinstatement of the
Southern Collegian.

If I am elected, I cannot guarantee
that all of the above will be done,
but I shall lend my support to these
proposals in all ways possible.

Dave Stovall

As a candidate for the office of
Sophomore Representative on the
Executive Committee, I have a duty
to present my views on issues at
Washington and Lee. First of all,
there is a need for election reform,
as illustrated by the lack of interest
in the recent student body elections.
Alternatives to the present system
would be explored. Secondly, a more
flexible exam schedule is needed.

Thirdly, I propose that a dormitory
committee be established consisting
of the head dorm counselors and the
freshman class officers to handle dis-
ciplinary problems. Next, the EC
should take the responsibility to
make certain that the new co-op and
Student Union plans will be carried
out for the student's benefit. I ad-
vocate exploring the possibility of
drinking at school dances. Finally, I
strongly support the tradition of
conventional dress. However, as a
tradition it should not be enforced,
but should be voluntary.

If elected, I will work for the ac-
complishment of as much of this
platform as possible. I will also try
to represent the views of the stu-
dent bedy and will appreciate any
suggestions or ideas. Finally, I am
prepared to devote the time and ef-
fort necessary for the fulfillment of
the office.

Richard Nash

I am glad to have this opportuni-
to formally announce my candidacy
for Junior Executive Committee
Representative. In the past year, as
Sophomore Representative I served
on the Student Union Committee,
conducted the study on the possibili-
ty of no Saturday classes, worked
on the possibility of a change in
the grading system, helped orientate
the entering freshmen, worked on
the revision of the ODK Forum,
served as an advisor from the E.C,
to the Independent Study Program,
submited suggested ideas for work to
the members of the Student Control,
Assimilation, Cold Check, and Li-
brary Control Committee, held sev-
eral class meetings, and conducted
several polls.

Next year, if reelected, I plan to
continue the legislative aspect of
the Executive Committee. I want to
propose a floating exam schedule,
enabling students to pick their own
time for taking exams; a junior year
abroad; and a possible division of
the Executive Committee into an
Honer Council and a Legislative
Branch. Further investigations
should alse be made on student
evaluation of courses and professors,
girls in the dorm, conventional dress,
and election procedures

Yet while keeping these reforms in
mind as important to Washington

Klingelhofer thought that except for
the fourth quarter, the defense of
Tom Mullenix, Mike Miles, and es-
pecially Glen Mattox, was impres-
sive.

Today’s return engagement with
the Roanoke Club was cancelled by
them. The “B” team, therefore, will
be idle until Saturday when they

Generals

Saturday Washington and Lee’s
lacrosse squad dropped a home game
to Towson State, 6-4.

Critical defensive breakdowns on
the part of the Generals which were
turned into scores by the opportun-
istic Towson team were the makings
of the defeat. The opposition’s stand
Stianke, could not be stopped
and scored three goals and three
assists.

Washington and Lee entered four
men into the scoring column. Terry
Griffith, Bruce Jackson, Jim Bower-
sox, and freshman Chap Chew, each
scored one. Joe Wicke had two as-
sists.

 

INTRAMURAL NEWS

In a defensive battle the Indepen-
dent Union defeated the PEP’s in
softball 20-19. Yesterday's affair
went nine innings.

Intramurals are drawing to
and no house has the cham-
pionship locked up. However, the

Delts are favored to regain the title.

ing. Terry Griffin was also mentioned
as having improved his game.

Failure to take advantage of extra
man situations, the Generals only
scored in one of twelve of these
situations, and sub-par riding and
clearing, an aspect they have always
previously executed well, were
thought by Coach Swan to be large
factors in the defeat.

The team was showing some tired-
ness from the

of playing above his freshman stand- |

previous ball game. |

Billy Andrews and Lance Bendann,
\the team co- -captains were on the
walking ailing list.

The coach said that it was a
| good physical effort but not one of
|the smartest games the team has
| played. The team is still giving thei:
| all. He hoped that factors would fall

together in the next three games.

The Generals face Washington
College at Wilson Field Saturday

in what is probably the roghest game
on the schedule. Swan lays to Wash-
ington the best attack in the coun-
try.

and Lee life, we must remember
that they are only secondary to the
main function of the Executive Com-
mittee. The primary responsibility
is the conducting of honor trials.
For this task, the E.C. needs mem-
bers who are responsible, serious
and of sound judgment. The enforce-
ment of W&L’s honor system is not
a responsibility to be lightly given
away.

In the last two years I have sat
on nearly thirty honor trials con-
cerning a great variation of viola-
tions. It is evident that this valuable
experience enables me to be better
prepared and equipped to handle
future trials.

For two years I have striven to
actively represent our class on the
Executive Committee. If elected, I
will continue working hard in try-
ing not only to represent our class
well, but to mke Washington and
Lee a much better university.

Four recommendations concerning
W&L fraternities were presented at
the student hearing of the Self-
Study Subcommittee on Social Fra-
ternities Tuesday. Self-Study An-
alyst Dean Lewis G. John announc-
ed the recommendations to an au-
dience of 20 students, although only
10 fraternities had members present.

The proposals, which will go to
the Self-Study Committee proper,
and then on to the faculty, were:

(1) Washington and Lee should
direct its immedate attention to the
social problems of non-fraternity
students. In particular, the construc-
tion of expanded student union fa-
cilities should be started just
soon as possible.

(2) Fraternities should be requir-
ed to utilize on a regular basis the
services of local Certified Public
Accountants.

(3) The University administration
and the IFC should investigate means
of improving the economic status,
the security, and the position of
housemothers, through bringing them
into closer connection with the Uni-
versity.

(4) Fraternities, through the Inter-
fraternity Council, should continue
and expand the self-study program
that they have begun, with particu-
lar regard to the development of ap-
propriate attitudes and ideals, se-
lection of members, scholarship, and
finances. The University, through
the Dean of Students and the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee, might con-

mittee approved a motion to request
the E. C. to appoint four students
who will work with four faculty
members, to be appointed by Dean
Pusey, to “continue study of methods
of stimulating student intellectual
activity.” This student-faculty com-
mittee was directed to report its
findings and recommendations to the
faculty, through the Courses and De-
grees committee, during the first se-
mester next year. The study com-
mittee will be “free to pursue any
line of enquiry it deems desirable,
including an investigation of inde-
pendent study and other programs.”
The Committee on Courses and De-
grees will provide the study com-
mittee with “advice and counsel,”
especially in regard to the evalua-
tion of existing programs and the
effort to place in perspective pre-
vious efforts to achieve intellectual
stimulation, both at Washington and
Lee and at other colleges and uni-
versities.

The Independent Study Program,
proposed recently by Jim Awad,
would move first-semester final ex-
ams up to the nine days before
Christmas vacation; each student
would be required during January,
to research and prepare a compre-
hensive project on any topic within
his major field of interest approved
by his faculty advisor. Such reports

Campus elections headed into their final phase Wednesday
night after primary elections for class officers and EC repre-

The final election is scheduled for Monday, May 2.

The high attendance at the class meetings preceding the
voting and the large number of candidates running for office
was in marked contrast to the Big Four elections earlier this
month, when the office of president of the student body went
unopposed and only 37 students appeared to hear the candi-

Friday Edition—April 29, 1966

No Immediate Threat

Despite some apprehension, the Self-Study apparently will
pose no immediate threat to the fraternity system as it now
stands. To quote Dean John from the student hearing on fra-
ternities—attended by slightly over two per cent of W&L’s
fraternity men, including only seven fraternity presidents—
“fraternities are an integral part of university life.”

The Self-Study Subcommittee on Social Fraternities did, in
fact, consider fraternity elimination, required 100 per cent
membership, and deferred rush, but it declined to make any
recommendations on these proposals. However, it did recom-
mend four positive programs which are likely to strengthen
and improve social fraternities if adopted by the faculty, and
accepted by the fraternities.

The Subcommittee recommended that in order to alleviate
the social problems of non-fraternity students, an expanded
student union should be started as soon as possible. While such
a project would offer competition to the fraternities (a healthy
thing in itself), it would also help to end one of the more
cogent criticisms of the system—the social ostracism imposed
on independents.

The Subcommittee further recommended that fraternities
be required to regularly utilize the services of a local Certified
Public Accountant. This proposal, not to be confused with
the more cumbersome one which was rejected earlier by the
L.F.C., would give the houses some degree of security against
both financial mismanagement and plain dishonesty. Security
of this nature can only be beneficial to the fraternities, and it
creates very little extra trouble for fraternity treasurers.

Next, the Subcommittee recommended that means of im-
proving the economic status, security, and position of fraterni-
ty housemothers be investigated. Low salaries, the ficklessness
of house opinion toward their housemothers, and the social
disrespect shown to them make good house mothers hard to
find and still harder to keep. The result has often been hap-
hazard house administration and frequent laborious searches
for replacements. If the University acts to set higher standards
for housemother employment and fraternity treatment of them,
it can only result in better, happier, and more effective house-
mothers, and thus improve house management.

Finally, the Subcommittee recommended that the fraterni-
ties “should continue and expand (their own) self-study pro-
gram... with particular regard to the development of appro-
priate attitudes and ideals, selection of members, scholarship
and finances.” Despite the innocuous-seeming shotgun appeal
of this last proposal, the Self-Study seems to be in dead earnest
about it. If the faculty adopts this recommendation, the fra-
ternities will be expected to consciously work for goals of self-
betterment and to make annual progress reports.

If the fraternities accept this last proposal in good faith
the resulting conscious effort at improvement will provide the
strongest possible answer to the fraternity system’s critics and
should serve to bolter the lagging interests of fraternity men
in their own houses.

The Self-Study Subcommittee on Social Fraternities is to
be commended for its good work, and it is hoped that the
faculty will adopt its proposals and fraternities will accept them
as the assets that they are.

Independent Study

Most often students hear of some action taken by “the
hill” to curb social activity, restrict individuals or employ
power where it’s unnecessary. This is unfortunate because in
many cases the committee system which in the main deals with
student activities has been more than fair in its contact with
the student body. This was borne out this week in the Execu-
tive Committee's proposal of the independent study program.

The program, as presented by junior Jim Awad, is an
excellent idea, but, as its author will admit, it does need some
more study before it is feasible. The Committee on Courses
and Degrees which most students thought would simply throw
out the measure as unworkable, instead lent a sympathetic ear
to both Awad and EC president Few Mindel. The committee's
resolution which agreed with the idea and set-up a student.
faculty committee to study this proposal and others, went fur-
ther than was necessary in meeting its obligation to the stu-
dents.

This example, coupled with the formation of the Student
Affairs Committee and Student Union Committee, both of
which have proven invaluable liaisons for passing information
from the student to the administration, are examples of how
lack of communication can best be achieved, avoiding mis-
understandings.

It is our hope that the new committee, charged to “stimu
late intellectual activity” at W&L will be as successful as its
predecessors.

Fiditer-in~Chief Business Manager

By JIM AWAD

It’s awfully difficult to figure out
just where this university has gone
wrong. As a matter of fact, I don’t
think you can pinpoint the matter.
Rather, the sum total of all admin-
istrative decisions over the past hun-
dred years has led this school down
a certain path—the path of secure
mediocrity.

Obviously, then, what we must
do and what W&L needs the most
is to rise above this level of medio-
crity. But how? To be frank, who
knows? God knows, I don’t even
pretend to have all the answers,
but I would like to present some
positive proposals, in hopes that some
day someone on the Hill will notice
the stinking stagnation of this place
and take heed!

Academic

It has repeatedly been pointed out
over the past year that our ap-
proach to education is unjustifiable,
behind the times, and peculiarly ap-
propriate to students in a prep school.
As it stands now, the way we are
educated is through taking down
the “truth” as explained by our
professors in a notebook, memoriz-
ing it, and throwing it back on a
quiz or final.

You know, even if this approach
does leave some inherent value, by
the time you’re 21 and a junior, you
feel that you've reached the point
of diminishing returns and are wast-
ing a hell of a lot of time.

Anyway, it is my impression that
our institutional framework ought to
be geared to the creative exercise
of the inherent mental capabilities
of the individual. Somehow, I get the
feeling that memorizing notes dosen't
allow for this wind of thing. The
following proposals have the purpose
of suggesting just a few of the many
ways we can improve on the situa-
tion.

1-2-3-4

First of all, we've got to have
the best of all possible professors,
and the only way to do this is to
pay them salaries above what other
universities offer them. There is
no excuse for losing a good profes-
sor because another school offered
him more money. Secondly, we must
de-emphasize grades so as to afford
students the opportunity to lift them-
selves out of the practice of direct-
ing all of their inherent abilities to-
ward “grade-grubbing.”

Thirdly, we must de-emphasize
the lecture system, substituting in
its place a system geared toward
class participation, the case study
approach, seminars for all courses
over 200, independent study into
fields outside of the classroom, and
creative thought.

Fourthly, we must strive toward
the creation of a better physical
plant. How can a professor or honors
student do adequate, publishable re-
search unless he has the proper fa-
cilities available to him?

5-6-7-8

Fifthy, in order to allow students
more time to pursue subjects or
personal interest, we must eliminate
Saturday classes and distribution re-
quirements. Sixthly, we must have a
much more flexible exam schedule,
so that exams, if they must be used,
will examine how much a student
knows, rather than how much he can
cram in-between his Friday exam
and Saturday exam.
Seventhly, a wider range of cours-

must be offered, for, without
doubt, the current range is rather re-
strictive Eighthly, we must give the
professors the time and facilities to
research and publish.

Ninth, it is essential that more
and better speakers be brought in
to address us on topics of national
and intellectual interest. The two
University of Virginia experts on
the Far East who spoke here last
week are perfect examples of what I
mean

€a

Social

In this area, the first thing we
must do is to analyze the current
status of fraternities. While the
“little eighteen” are previding an
invaluable service with respect to
social life and housing, their effort
is not altogether positive. Perhaps a
large student union with Saturday
night combos and liquor, coupled
with a second-semester rush, would
release the Greeks stronghold on
eampus, thereby forcing the fraterni-
to justify themselves both in
attitude and aet.

Secondly, W&L needs to strive fo:
contact with the outside
world so as te put an end to its
sickening The key
here would provide for a
junior vear abroad, give eredit for

os 0) mir © 7 and Ralure 90 a

 

to facilitate an exchange of ideas and
to allow for outside research and
social projects.

Thirdly, W&L must de-emphasize
the past and begin to look toward
the future for a source of inspira-
tion. No doubt, the past can teach
us lessons, but it can also narrow the
horizon of our thinking and hinder
progress.

Fourthly, we should make every
attempt to put an end to the stifling
uniformity to the student body. This
can be done by recruiting students
from foreign nations, from the West
Coast, and from underpriviledged
areas. How can one broaden his
thinking if everyone thinks just like
him?

Fifthly, said countless

as I’ve

GRINS

lay Tales

 

 

times before, we have a demanding
obligation to encourage individuality
in every facet of university life.

Athletics
With respect to athletics, the cur-
rent policy is admirable in that it
gives every student a chance to par-
ticipate. Perhaps, though, if we sub-
sidized football and basketball, the
students here would have something
to be proud of and would have great-
er school spirit. Consequently, they
themselves would make every effort
to do their part in improving the
university,
Conclusion
Well, they asked me to write about
what W&L needs most. As I said,
you can’t put your finger on it,

 

“I'd love to... since Independent Study started at
They're all working so HARD!”

In Fourteen Very Easy-to-Make Errors

because it’s a whole atmosphere, at-
titude and environment that we’ve
got to fight.

Above I’ve stated just a few pro-
posals as the solution to some glar-
ing deficiencies. Unfortunately, no
space was available to justify each
proposal, but I intend to explore the
matter in more depth next year.

Above all, what this university
needs is dynamic leadership. It would
take such leadership to even begin
to consider the above proposals. But
you know, and I know, that the Hill
will read this article and others like
it, comment on how good the ideas
were, and then go about their work,
never even considering the possibil-
ity of action.

As a sequel to the recent faculty
cut system poll, Professor Martin
Merson has polled
his classes to de-
termine the stu-
dents’ opinions on
the cut system and
how it has affect-
ed them. Forty
nine students were
polled altogether.
including § fresh-
men, 22 sopho-
mores, 14 juniors,
and 4 seniors.

Agreeing with
the faculty, most students polled in-
dicated that they have treated the
liberalized cut system responsibly,
but about half indicated that the
faculty has not generally treated the
eut system in good faith. The student
consensus in the poll is that the cut
system has not lowered their grades
and that they were unaffected by the
suspension of the first semester au-
tomatic rule. The great majority
prefer to be given complete freedom
as to class attendance

The questions asked and
answer percentages out of
polled are as follows:

I would prefer to be given com-
plete freedom as to class attendance:
Yes—86 per cent: No—14 per cent

De vou think the liberalized cut
system has in any way lowered your
grades? Yes—10 per cent: No—90 per

Do vou think that vou have treated

Students Polled On Cut System’s Effects

Part Two

A second part of the poll surveyed
student opinions on reasons for jus-
tified elass cutting. Thirty-nine per
cent answered that cutting is justified
for whatever reason the student
chooses. Most of the 61 per cent that
did not mark this answer indicated
that cutting is justified (1) to attend

political, scholarly, professional
meetings, ete, which conflict with
classes; (2) minor contagious ill-

nesses (i.c.. colds, sore throat); (3)
last minute eramming for an exam:

(4) preparation of term papers, re-

Editor Choice Criticized

Dear Sir,

The Publications Board's choice of

me his qualifications and experience
are unquestionable

But the 1 wish to raise is

the light of the Collegian’s spotty
past and doubtful future. What de

Racketmen at

UVa. Today;

Freshmen Defeat SMA, 7-1

By JERRY PERLMAN

Coach Canfield’s undefeated W&L
netters travel to Charlottesville to-
day for a very important match
with the Cavaliers of U. Va.
The BGenerals, throttled by rains
which washed out watches on Mon-
day and Wednesday, go into the
fray sporting an impressive 4-0 rec-
ord, Today’s match, though, prom-
ises to be the first real test of the
season for Canfield’s racketmen. The
Cavaliers boast an extremely strong
squad which includes five return-
ing lettermen, whose 9-3 record last
year included a win over W&L.

Freshman ace Tommy Rueger, the
General’s number one singles player,
can expect a lot of trouble from U.
Va. co-captain Jim Stephens, his op-
posite number on the Cavalier squad.
Stephens was runner-up in the At-
lantic Coast Conference tournament
last year and is having another fine
season. W&L captain Forrest Dick-
inson will also have all he can han-
dle in the form of U. Va. senior
Harry Burn, whom Cavalier Coach
P. Hunter Faulconer says “has the
most natural ability on the team.”

Although the varsity was hamper-
ed this week by rain, W&L’s fresh-
man tennis team managed to open
its six-mateh season. The Baby
Generals split their first two matches,
dropping their opener to Virginia
Episcopal School of Lynchburg 5-4
on Tuesday, but bouncing back to
trounce Staunton Military Academy
7-1 on Thursday.

In Tuesday’s match, VES jumped
off to a commnding early lead, win-
ning four of the six singles matches.
The only singles recorded for the
freshmen were at the numbers two
and three singles spots. Don Me-
Clure, playing in the number two
slot, took the measure of his op-
ponent 6-3, 8-6. Britt McJunkin,
playing number three, was extended
to three sets, but finally managed to
pull out a 1-6, 6-3, 6-0. victory.

The frosh almost managed to eke
out a victory via their doubles play.
Wins of 6-3, 6-0 and 6-5, 6-4 were
posted by McJunkin and Joe Daven-
port in the number one doubles
match, and by McClure and Jerry
Perlman in the number three doubles
match respectively. This tied the
match score at 4-4 with only the
number two doubles match left to
play. After a hard battle, Chris

I-M’s Closing;
Delts in Lead

The intramural season is coming
to a close, and the final results bear
a strong resemblance to the out-
comes of the past several years. Phi
Kap is making a strong run to re-
tain the Great Athletic Champion
Trophy which they have won for
the past two years.

The results, which have been post-
ed on the intramural board show
the Delts to be leading in total in-
tercollegiate and intramural sports
points with 1256, followed closely by
the Phi Kaps with 1241. Still to be
posted in intramurals are points for
wrestling, bowling, softball and col-
leyball. Participation points for
Spring intercollegiate sports will be
determinted at the end of the sea-
son,

At present, Phi Kap leads in the
fight for the Intercollegiate Trophy
with 568 points, followed by the Delts
with 527, and PiKA with 515. The
Delts head the field in intramurals
with 729 points, fololwed by Phi Kap
with 673, PiPhi with 667, and SAE
iwth 654. The winners will be pre-
sented with their trophies at the
Spring Sporis Banquet at Coach
Mac's estate on May 18.

Meyer and John White were downed
6-4, 6-4 and VES emerged the victor
5-4.

In Thursday’s match with SMA,
things were somewhat different, as
the freshmen took five of the six
singles and both of the doubles
matches played. The third doubles
match was canceled because of im-
pending darkness, leaving the score
7-1 in favor of W&L.

Singles wins were posted by
Davenport at number one, 6-0, 6-2;
McClure at number two, 6-1, 6-1;
McJunkin at number three, 6-1, 6-0;
Meyer at number four, 6-2, 6-3; and
Perlman at number six in the long-
est match of the day, 5-7, 6-1, 7-5.

In the doubles action, the matches
played were limited to 10-game pro
sets in order to beat the setting
sun. Both matches were won by
the freshmen, Davenport and Mc-
Junkin taking the first 10-3 and Mc-
Clure and Meyer the second, 10-4.

The freshmen travel to Charlottes-
ville today with the varsity to play
the U. Va. frosh, and return home
tomorrow to face a very tough St.
Christopher’s School squad at 2 p.m.
on the W&L varsity courts.

President Cole
Calls New Gym
Primary Need

 

In 1913 Robert Parker Doremus

visited the Washington and Lee cam-
pus, and because he was so impres-
sed by the friendliness and cour-

tesy of a student, he provided in his

will that upon the death of Mrs.

Doremus his entire estate should be

given to W&L.
This money was used to erect
Doremus Gymnasium which at the

time of its completion in 1915 was | —
the finest in the South. Yet today
Doremus is outmoded and inade-|/
quate for the needs of the Univer- |

sity.

Washington and Lee President
Fred C. Cole has realized this prob-
lem and has commented that “as a
major facility, this bears highest pri-
ority. This is obviously one of our
most important needs as a com-
plete physical facility.”

Preliminary plans for a new gym
are underway, and according to Dr.
Cole, “we are hoping to start an
organized campaign for fund rais-
ing by next winter. At that time a
target date will be set.”

The new gym, as tentatively pro-
posed, will be a structure separate
from Doremus and most likely be
erected in the area above Wilson
Field. Doremus will be maintained
however, and will be used for phy-
sical education and for individual
recreation, thus allowing for both
better and more complete facilities.

“... medalist honors”

Golf Team Goes To

Virginia Tournament

By RON KESSLER

Washington and Lee’s varsity golf
team, in the midst of a mediocre
season, travels to Hot Springs on
Sunday to play in the 36-hole,
medal-play Virginia State Intercol-
legiate Tournament on the Home-
stead’s championship Upper Cascades
Golf Course.

The State Tournament was origi-
nated by Washington and Lee, Vir-
ginia Tech and U. Va. in the late
1940’s. Since then, nine colleges
have been added to the list, mak-
ing a total of twelve participating
Monday. Each school designates six
to play, the low four of whom are
counted.

V.P.L. is the defending champion of
the tournament, and is, as Coach
E. P. “Cy” Twombly put it, “the
team to beat this year. Virginia has
the best chance to upset Tech; we’ve
got an outside chance, if we can
beat Tech and U. Va.”

The winner of the tournament re-
ceives a sterling silver bowl given by
the State Golf Association .

The team’s record so far this year
is 2 and 3. The Generals beat Hamp-
den-Sydney early in the season 7%
to 114; they then lost to Georgetown
6-3 and U. Va. 14-7. Most recently,
W&L, played Old Dominion and

There will be, as usual, juniors
ridiculing the freshmen and soph-
omores for their childish attitudes.
And there will be, as usual, seniors
castigating the juniors for omitting
one of the finer pleasures in life.

What we are waiting for is the
successful pick-up of a SIPA Bunny
by a 5'5” “gentleman,” only to have
him find out that her older brother
starts at tackle for VMI.

Oh yes, there is one more “as
usual.” How can there possibly be a
SIPA convention without the candi-
date proposed by one of our own
“gentlemen?” In my four glorious
years at this lovely Hill-topped cam-
pus, 1 cannot remember one such
election without at least one unusu-
ally named candidate, one who for
some reason no true SIPA knows.
(1 was going to cite a few such
names used in the past to guide this
year’s plotters, but 1 have just been
reminded that the R-t P has no wish
to go where the Collegian has gone).

Last but not least, a note to all
seniors. Did you know that while
we have unlimited cuts for classes,
we have absolutely no cuts for grad-
uation? This means that any senior
who misses either the Baccalaureate
er the Commencement exercises

doesn’t graduate. Now you know
why they are both in the morning.
Everybody will obviously be suffer-
ing from severe headaches, and it
will be the last chance for torture
on the W&L campus.

The great joke is that there may
have to be two graduations this
year. One of the draft-dodging ex-
ams is scheduled for Friday morn-
ing, June 3. Anyone assigned that
date will most likely have to be
graduated at a special make-up
time in the afternoon. No one out-

on Capitol Hill.

Notice

The IFC Buses will run for the
last time this year Saturday, April
30, at 11:45 p.m. They will leave
from Red Square and go to Ran-
dolph-Macon, Hollins, Sweet Briar,
and Mary Baldwin.

Bridgewater in a triangular match,
losing to ODC 5-1, and defeating
Bridgewater 512 to 42. Bobby Mat-
thews took medalist honors with a
74,

Co-Captain Ed Crosland has led
the team thus far, taking medalist
honors against Hampden-Sydney
with a 74, shooting 73 against
Georgetown, and 76 against U. Va.
Crosland tied for fourth last year
at the State Tourney, and was run-
ner-up for medalist at the CAC.

Freshman Bobby Matthews has
thus far had an outstanding season,
taking medalist honors against
Hampden-Sydney as well as in the
triangular match with Old Dominion
and Bridgewater, shooting a 74. Mat-
thews scored a team low of 72 against
Georgetown.

Commenting on the rest of the
team, Coach Twombly said, “Roger
Sennott has really improved this
year, and should do well at the
State Tournament. Jim Fulwider is
a good golfer, but he must get hot
on putting. Bob Duckwall has been
having a little trouble, but he’s
got the golf swing to do fairly well.

“The team as a whole,” Coach
Twombly continued, “is better bal-
anced than last year’s yet has a
worse record. We've got a fair
chance in the State’s and a fair
chance in the CAC.”

Friday, the Generals play Lynch-
burg and Roanoke. The College Ath-
letie Conference Tournament is
scheduled for May 13-14, hosted by
Washington College in St. Louis.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Rising Junior EC Candidates State Platforms

Richard Nash

There can be no doubt that Wash-
ington and Lee is one of the better
universities not only of the South,
but of the entire country. But to
say that we need a great many im-
provements is quite an understate-
ment,

The trouble with Washington and
Lee is that it has become so conser-
vative in the fear of making a mis-
take that it has almost reached a
point of stagnation. This does not
mean that we should kick up our
heels and charge recklessly into a
series of uninvestigated and radical
reforms. But it does mean that we
should begin to investigate and set
a course of action.

A prime tool which would great-
ly enable us to push forward would
be the division of the Executive
Committee into a legislative and
judicial body. With this accomplish-
ment, work may be speeded up by
the legislative division without any
hindrances. The honor court will
also become more efficient with its
specialization.

But this reform will only serve
as a main thrust. Next year the
committee must spearhead the attack
by doing ground work on such
things as conventional dress, float-
ing exam schedules, junior years
abroad, grading system changes, girls
in dorms, and many other issues.
Student preferences must be ob-
tained and appropriate action taken.

I have done my best to serve
you well both legislatively and judi-
cially for the past two years. If
reelected, I will attempt to do even
more to help you and our univer-
sity.

Dave Johnson

Fellow Classmates,

In this campaign, I have made an
effort to present honestly to you
my views on a number of issues.
To briefly review my position on
them, I give you the following:

(1) I strongly support Convention-
al Dress, but am opposed to an
Assimilation Committee with fining
power.

(2) I endorse all efforts to improve
academics including the possibilities
of an Independent Study Plan and
Junior Year Abroad, if practical ar-
rangements can be provided.

(3) I favor maintaining the frater-
nity system, and I encourage the use
of influence to accelerate the com-
pletion of the University-planned
student facilities

(4) I believe the Honor System
functions most effectively as it is

presently constituted, and I oppose
any changes in it.

(5) I am against any proposal to
divide the Executive Committee in-
to legislative and judiciary groups,
favoring instead the use of subcom-
mittees to expedite legislative mat-
ters.

You have my statement on the is-
sues. If I am elected to the E.C., I
pledge to work diligently and cease-
lessly as an effective member.

Respectfully
David T. Johnson

 

Lane Steinger

As candidate for Junior Class Rep-
resentative to the Executive Com-
mittee I speak from experience.
The past year on the E.C. has
shown me that there are two goals
which next year’s Committee must
have. The first is determination to
administer to the needs of the stu-
dent body by asserting its (the Com-
mittee’s) policies with the faculty
and administration. The role of the
Executive Committee is not to exe-
cute only those policies which the
administration desires. Any pro-
grams, initiated by students, which
are approved by the E.C, must be
made to be recognized on the Hill.

The second goal is an internal re-
organization of the Committee so
that it is more efficient. A great deal
of time in weekly meetings is devot-
ed to administrative functions, e.g.,
interviewing and selecting standing
committees such as Student Control,
which preclude E.C. investigation of
issues such as changing the grading
system to include plusses. The E.C.
should establish subcommittee to
deal with its administrative func-
tions. A separation of powers is not
necessary to accomplish this end
because the judicial responsibilities
of the Committee do not infringe
upon its other role, Division of the
E.C. into a Judicial Board and
Legislative Body might also prove
detrimental to the Honor System in
that the latter, meeting regularly,
would necessarily supercede the
Honor Court in prominence.

The above goals must be realized.
They are fundamentally important
and the success and efficacy of stu-
dent government at Washington and
Lee is contingent upon them. There
are, however, two specific goals
which the Executive Committee, to
be elected Monday, should investi-
gate before the end of this year.
First, the Committee should con-
sider establishing a Student Cur-
riculum Committee to exaluate
courses in the undergraduate school.
The Committee should also consider

 

sponsoring mixers with neighboring

 

Self-Study Proposals Heard

(Continued from page 2)

gation of affirmative guidelines to
prescribe for the fraternities, the
ideals, standards, and attitudes ex-
pected of them, and also to provide
a frame of reference within which
this self-study could be carried out.
The fraternities would be expected
to conduct this self-examination on
a continuing basis, and they would
be called upon to present evidence
annually to the Student Affairs Com-
mittee concerning their progress to-
ward achievement of acknowledged
goals.

In addition, the students present
voted, 9 to 8, that no fraternity be
allowed to remain at Washington
and Lee if its national organization
enforces a written discriminatory
clause on it. Although three WéL
fraternities would be affected by
such a ruling, the student vote was
unofficial and unconnected with the
Self-Study Subcommittee on Social
Fraternities. The proposal was origi-
nated by senior Syd Lewis. Dean
Atwood, attending the meeting, re-
marked that a non-discriminatory
declaration could come only from the
Trustees.

Another proposal to the effect that

the University should define the
function of the fraternities was pro-
posed by Rick Margolies, but it
failed by ten votes.

A proposal by Bob Lee that de-
ferred rush be adopted was received
so cooly that it was never brought
to a vote. Commenting on the stu-
dents’ proposals, Dean Atwood ob-
jected to the attitude of “what should
the faculty do to the students,” and
stressed the imporance of fraterni-
ties bringing about changes through
their own Interfraternity Council,

IFC President Chuck Griffin con-
curred with Atwood, stating that
the IFC is always ready to hear and
consider student proposals for change
in the fraternity system.

The Subcommittee on Social Fra-
ternities will present its four pro-
posals to the Self-Study Committee
in May. Presumably, the Self-Study
will inelude them in its final report.

I urge you to reflect upon the
candidates for this race and to de-
cide judiciously for whom you will
cast your votes.

Jody Kline

Since I am not able to talk per-
sonally with each of my classmates
and explain to them individually my
beliefs and ideas, I hope to use this
opportunity to reach all of them in
this way in order to outline the
programs and proposals that I would
like to see the Executive Commit-
tee consider next year.

I feel that the EC, being the most

capable of expressing student opin-
ion has an unutilized potential in
influencing the policies of the Ad-
ministration. For this reason I would
like to se the EC attempt to ac-
celerate the physical progress of
W&L—that is, speeding up its build-
ing and renovation program. I would
also like the BC to draw up some
guidelines derived from _ student
opinion concerning the admissions
policies.
Internally, I feel that there is
much that can be done to improve
our curriculum. I concur with the
proposals for a Junior Year Abroad
program, a more flexible exam
schedule, and the distinguished pro-
fessors lectures series. I would also
hope that the University would try
to complete the Self-Study Program
concerning curriculum as soon as
possible.

I have labelled my platform “Pro-
gressive Conservativism.” I am con-
servative in that I believe that
Washington and Lee has several tra-
ditions that should not be changed
because they have given her an
image throughout the country that
has ranked us above schools who are
possibly better academically. I do not
feel that mere change is synonymous
with progress. I would try next year,
if elected to the EC, to maintain the
facets that have made W&L a good
university and to sponsor progres-
sive ideas that could make our
school a great university.

 

Study-Plan Committee

(Continued from page 1)

Awad commented that he was
“pleased” with the decision by the
Courses and Degrees committee to
give the Independent Study program
further consideration. “We realize,”
he went on to say, “that as it pres-
ently stands, the program may not
be entirely feasible. We do feel, how-
ever, that the idea itself is well
worthwhile, and within a year we
hope to come up with something.”

On Cut System’s Effects

than endure a poor lecture or class.
Very few of the student polled saw
justification in cutting (1) to do
anything rather than attend a poor
lecture or class; (2) for a morning
date or road trip; (3) minor non-
contagious illnesses (headache, hang-
over); (4) to make up for lost sleep;
(5) an occasional day off; or (6) im-
portant fraternity activities.

While the only students polled
were those in Professor Merson’s
classes, they seem fairly representa-
tive. There were about as many arts
majors as commerce majors, with
a few science majors.

In summary, the student cut poll
seems to show a considerable amount
of student judgment and respon-
sibilty in dealing with the cut sys-
tem. The answers given for what
constitutes a “justified” cut are par-
ticularly indicative of mature
thought. While there are some dis-
crepancies between faculty and stu-
dent opinions about the cut system’s
effect on grades, the poll, if it can
be considered representative, re-af-
firms that the liberalized cut system
is working and should be retained, if
not further liberalized.

 

Northwestern Professor
Discusses Joyce’s Life

As Seen Through Letters
(Continued from page 2)

wright, Mr. Ellmann gave his lec-
ture in which he commented on
Joyce's “mental scenery” as glimps-
ed at in his correspondences with
his family, friends, and contempor-
ary authors. He commented that
Joyce’s letters were often prevail-
ingly terse, contrary to the style
of his novels, and were often frag-
ments of self-analysis which have
had to be pieced together. His aware-
ness of his “moral nature” under-
lies most of his correspondence.

Problems encountered in editing
Joyce's letters arose because of his
proficiency in languages. He fre-
quently wrote in Italian (he spoke
Italian with his children) and cor-
responded with Ibsen in Danish,
which he studied by himself. He
also had some knowledge of French,
Latin, modern Greek, German and
Dutch. He mastered a few words of
Urdu, Burmese, Russian and Spanish
and a number of other languages in-
cluding Esperanto and Lilliput.

Following the lecture was a short
question period; the seminar then
adjourned to the gallery for coffee
and an opportunity to meet Mr.
Elliman on a more personal basis.

‘CAMPUS
FASHIONS

ESQUIRE’S FASHION EDITOR

THE TRANSITION T0 SPRING gradually releases us all from our

musty Winter hang-ups. The state-of-seige atmosphere on campus
diminishes as the thermometer rises, and overnight that term paper
you’ve been dreading falls into place. Spring is also the proper time
to think about shifting your wardrobe in the direction of the warm

spectrum of colors. But before purchasing, look
ahead: is this a summer geared for absolute
relaxation, a summer job, or, if you're graduat- ,
ing, your entry into the business world next >
Fall? Make your selection accordingly.

“AWAY FROM WHITE” ‘That phrase charac-

terizes the gradual phasing out of the classic
white dress shirt. Today, color predominates,
and blue leads the pack. Look also for a wide
range of soft pastel shades, both solids and

Nominations and elections in the

ings Monday.

General elections will be held
Monday from 8 am. to 5 pm. in
Washington Hall. Two votes are
permitted to each voter in the E.C,
races; only one vote in the class
elections.

Also being voted on in the elec-
tions Monday will be the new

amendment to the student govern-
ment which would make it possible
in future elections for write-in can-
didates to be elected. The amend-
ment was drawn up and unanimous-

meeting last Monday night.

 
  

   

LIGHTWEIGHT, EASY-CARE: these are the {1
watchwords in tailored apparel. Crisp, cool fab- 4
rics with built-in wrinkle-resistance and/or per-
manent press features are now standard. The
color story for Spring focuses on BLUEGRASS,
a blend of vibrant blues and sparkling greens.
It should rank as a top color consideration in
selecting all your Spring/Summer apparel. A
pin wale-cord suit, for example, in a lightweight
cotton/polyester blend, or a classic Natural
Shoulder seersucker suit in a BLUEGRASS
blend are excellent choices. Lightweight, double-

a whole new

blend perfectly with the new

Spring suits. Many of these color-toned dress
shirts incorporate permanent press features,
Another trend worth noting: the button-down
collar sans buttons. Collar points are slightly
longer, the buttons disappear altogether, and
the buttonless button-down may be worn with
or without a pin.

ACCESSORIES MAKE THE MAN, and you couldn't get off to a

better start than by selecting one of the new Summer straw hats.
Time was when Memorial Day marked the date for turning in your
winter felt and bringing out your summer straw, Today, any time
the weather's right, the time is right. The classic boater with its
flat top, relatively narrow brim, and colorful ribbon band remains
a top choice among college men, The panama with its characteristic
crown ridge has been modified in size and will appear in both closed
and open weave meshes, Though light, off-white and natural tan
shades predominate, you'll see a number of new color variations,
including a pewter gray milan with its characteristic center crease

THERE'S NEWS IN UNDERWEAR for Spring and Summer ‘66,

The breakthrough can be summed up in three words: slim, trim,

the underwear scene, with the accent on the slim look. Look for
mock-turtle T-shirte, as well as shirts with a deep neck which
doesn't show when worn with an open sport shirt. In shorts, news

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

SIPA SPECIAL

SIPA and Sigma Delta Chi

Journalism students at Washington and Lee University have
long assisted in the myriad tasks surrounding the annual con-
vention of the Southern Interscholastic Press Association.
Before this year, however, the W&L chapter of Sigma Delta
Chi, national professional journalistic society, had only one
official duty during SIPA weekend: sponsorship of the dance
and serving as a floor committee there.

This year, those journalism majors who have been selected
for membership in Sigma Delta Chi also are including the
publication of the annual SIPA Ring-tum Phi Special as one of
the chapter’s 1965-66 projects, and, consequently, SDX at
Washington and Lee further identifies with SIPA.

Since Sigma Delta Chi and the Southern Interscholastic
Press Association pursue common goals and uphold similar
ideals, we believe this addition to the SDX functions at SIPA

is appropriate and will be one to benefit both organizations.

At Washington and Lee, SIPA and SDX are linked by
history. Forty years ago this month, SIPA was established “to
serve as a stimulus in raising and maintaining high standards
of scholastic journalism and to unite in a common organization
the scholastic journalists of the South.” Three years later, in
1929, 25 men founded the W&L chapter of Sigma Delta Chi
and pledged themselves to the three major purposes of the
society: ‘“To associate journalists of talent, truth and energy
into a more intimately organized unit of good fellowship, to
assist the members in acquiring the noblest principles of jour-
nalism and to cooperate with them in this field, and to advance
the standards of the press by fostering a higher ethical code,
thus increasing its value as an uplifting social agency.” More-
over, in 1960, SDX added a working objective to this state-
ment of purposes which ties in specifically with SIPA: “To
attract talented young people at high school and college level
to the journalistic field and to nurture this interest until the in-
dividual becomes a practitioner.”

Sigma Delta Chi also aids SIPA in various other ways.
Members aid in planning, preparing and registering for the
convention. Officials of the association, including Professors
Riegel, Davis and Jennings, have been initiated into SDX,
and one of the newspaper short course instructors, Timothy
O’Keefe-—once an SIPA delegate—was chapter president in
1964-65. All are promoting the aims of both SDX and SIPA
in singular actions.

As this 37th conventions concludes, while the W&L chap-
ter of Sigma Delta Chi congratulates the 1,200 delegates on
another outstanding convention, members of the journalis-
tic society welcome the opportunity to serve the press asso-
ciation in additional ways during the SIPA meetings to come.

“It’s staggering,” Prof. O. W. Riegel said, to estimate
the number of persons who have been delegates to the
37 conventions of the Southern Interscholastic Press
Association.

The figure probably exceeds 30,000, most of whom
are living, many of whom “I meet and am told, ‘I was
an SIPA delegate in such-and-such a year,” and
some of whom later decided upon journalism as a ca-
reer, he noted.

“Thousands have, maybe,” the veteran SIPA direc-
tor said, and a good many made Washington and Lee
University an intermediate step between SIPA and
work in the mass media.

Prof. Riegel emphasises that SIPA was not founded
for this purpose—to lure potential journalism students
to W&L—‘“‘but we have found this to be an advan-
tageous by-product on many occasions. They come here
during high school and like it so well they return for
college.”

“To serve as a stimulus in raising and maintaining
high standards of scholastic journalism and to unite in
a common organization the scholastic journalists of the
South,” SIPA was established in April of 1926 by the
W&L Department of Journalism and Communications,
in cooperation with W&L’s Lee Memorial Journalism
Foundation and the Southern Newspaper Publishers’
Asociation (SNPA).

Seventy-six delegates from 11 states attended the
first convention, by 1941 official registration had sur-
passed the 500 mark, during the last 10 years the total

Virginia’s largest radio news staff—
Home Edition of Radio Washing-
ton and Lee — gives Lexington,
Buena Vista and Rockbridge Coun-
ty their most complete daily news
coverage.

The broadcast Monday through
Friday from the studios on the third
floor of Reid Hall concludes the
programing on Lexington’s WREL
Radio and reaches an estimated 1,000
listeners.

 

It is a 15-minute report of not only
local but also top international, na-
tional, state and sports stories, and
comes at the end of the nightly,
two-hour Radio W&L program.

Combining classroom, laboratory
and extra-curricular activity, the
Home Edition staffers often break
stories several days before the week-
ly papers published in Lexington and
Buena Vista do.

breaking 1,200 representatives came from 352 publi-

Now the third largest scholastic press association in
nation, SIPA was an innovation in the fashion of
one authorized in 1869 by Robert E. Lee, when presi- |
dent of Washington College (now Washington and
Lee). Under Lee’s guidance, the college offered 50 press
scholarships, representing the first journalism instruc-
tion in the world.

The SNPA revived in 1921 this project which lan-
guished after Lee’s death, and subsequently the concept
of extending journalism instruction to Southern secon-
dary schools was envisioned.

SIPA, especially its criticism service, is now a major
undertaking for the professors of journalism and com-
munications at W&L, and the organization maintains
permanent offices on the third floor of Reid Hall, the
home of the journalism department.

Prof. Riegel said this week SIPA has grown to the
extent that it is now “one of the leading agencies for
encouraging interest in publications.”

the convention provides a unique

means of contact between professional newsmen and
secondary school teachers and students involved in
journalism,” he added. “The press association increases
the appreciation of high standards and good values of

enhances the audience of intelligent

newspaper readers, and introduces teachers to the uses SIPA maintains cillen in W&L’s
of publications for instructional purposes.”

W&L journalism students in inter-
mediate reporting (first semester
juniors) and advanced reporting
(second semester seniors) cover the
city and county seene, local law en-
forcement agencies, schools and edu-
cation in general, civic clubs and
organizations and sports.

This news, plus dispatches from
the Associated Press radio and “A”
wires, is rewritten by members of
each of the five nightly staffs in
order to produce a program of sound
format and consistent style.

Home Edition also broadcasts taped
interviews with persons in the news
and has editorials during the first
semester, when Prof. O. W. Riegel’s
seminar course in The Editorial is
in session.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

Columnist Says They Are Horrified

 

  

hind this?

Questioning brings a rash of unprintable answers, but the general
idea is that it’s nice to have girls on the campus for a change. There is also
a widespread feeling that it might be nice to meet a SIPA girl or three.

Sponsors Horrified

This tendency is noticed by the

SIPA Brings Varied Reactions :
From Everyone But Sponsors

By WEBB DeHOFF

During the short time that the SIPA young ladies grace the Washington
and Lee campus each spring, there is a noticeable rash of fresh shaves and
Sunday tweeds among the W&L student body. What is the motivation be-

girls with mixed emotions, and by

their sponsors with something approaching horror. At least that’s what

it seems to be.

No sponsors were available for extended interviews, since most turned
red and spluttered at questions like “How would you like for your girls

to meet some nice W&L gentlemen and maybe...” One sponsor reportedly
used her umbrella on a W&L man she found making advances toward

her girls.

The girls, however, were quite willing to be interviewed. They were
only too happy to give their opinions of W&L men, W&L’s campus, and

Lexington.

Restaurants or Not?

Views of Lexington varied according to the sleeping accommodations
acquired here and the number of dented fenders picked up on the spacious
local streets. Most ranged from “stuffy” to “ECCH” to “How can I find
a decent, uncrowded restaurant?” This last answer brands one as a SIPA
novice, as veterans know that such are non-existent.

The W&lL campus elicits such stimulating and original comments as
“GEE, you sure got pretty buildings,” “Where's the nearest lavatory?,”
and “Gosh, look at all the college men.”

Opinions of W&L men are sometimes hard to get, since a young lady’s
feelings are often not to be revealed. The consensus is either “I wish they'd
leave us alone” or “I wish they wouldn't leave us alone,” making it a game
for the W&L man to sort the first category from the last.

 

Dr. Boyle, Leverty Conduct
Typical Short Course Sessions

Typical of the 35 short courses
offered to delegates at the South-
ern Interscholastic Press Association
were those taught Friday by Dr.
Regis Boyle and William G. Lever-
ty.

Dr. Boyle, an instructor at Wash-
ington’s Woodrow Wilson High
School, taught the course on year-
book layout and offered delegates ad-
vice on how to make their annuals

 

William Leverty

 

more artistic as well as more read-
able.

“The center is dead,” she caution-
ed, while emphasizing the utility of
white space as a decorative feature
not to be avoided.

Among other hints offered by Dr.
Boyle were the suggestions that all
faces of type for the annual be in-
troduced in the first portion of the
book, and that similar layouts not be
used on opposite pages.

Readability Stressed

Leverty, the assistant managing
editor of the Richmond Times-
Dispatch, each year teaches the
course on newspaper makeup.

One of the many professional
journalists who participate in SIPA
each year, Leverty told those in at-
tendance at his course that “read-
ability, not beauty” is the most im-
portant aspect of newspaper make-
up.

He stressed that particular atten-
tion must be paid to the use of cuts
because, as he put it, “More tricks
(of makeup) can be done with
pictures than copy.”

Leverty'’s talk was illustrated by
a series of slides taken from var-
ious high school papers from this
area.

 

Where Did ‘SIPA Weather’ Go?

At 2:07 p.m. Friday, the bitterest
of all enemies for SIPA confronted
the 37th convention and conquered.

The enemy was rain and it
brought about the usual umbrellas,
raincoats, plastic scarves, and sur-
rying from one class to another
on the Washington and Lee cam-
pus.

Actually, the sight is not a

usual one for SIPA.
Reports in 1964 were that every
convention—there had been 34
until that time—had been greeted
by sunny weather.

But a deluge dominated that 35th
convention.

Last year, when the convention
was moved up to the first week-
end in April, the weather was
pleasant—excepting an occasional
shower.

Until early Friday afternoon,
SIPA  weather-watchers were
were hopeful that the cloud cover

cate its 1964 performance.

As the rain began falling, the dis-
couraged group retired to a se-
cluded room in Reid Hall and
vowed never to emerge until what
Prof. O. W. Riegel has tagged
“SIPA weather” returns to Lex-
ington.

William Grigg Says Specialty Writing
Is Now Commonplace in Journalism

By MICKEY PHILLIPS

Emphasizing the significance in-
depth reporting adds to a general
newsstory, Washington Evening Star
science writer William T. M. Grigg
told a Lee Chapel audience this
morning that specialty reporting has
become common-place in today’s
newspapers.

“The days of the classic reporter
are over,” Grigg said. “More and
more, readers are demanding stricter
attention to detail, background, and
thought provocation. They want
more than just the surface of the
story.”

Mistakes Overcome

“To get where we are now, how-
ever, we've had to solve many prob-
lems,” Grigg said. “In the beginning,
we weren't sure of ourselves, which
showed clearly in our _ reporting.

Mistakes of fact were made frequent-
_—

Grigg then said that investigation
of projects, reading learned journals,
and traveling to the scene have
helped in the rapid dissolution of er-
rors and the growth of the field.

Own Assignments

We've come so far that we can't
wait to get assignments from our
editors,” Grigg said. “Generally, the
editors give us the green light to
go ahead with projects of our own.”

“This is the way it should be,”
Grigg said.

Grigg pointed out that the Eve-
ning Star now has expert writers
covering Communist affairs, Latin
American countries, and science, and
one who is an instant expert on
anything.

“He's the one who gets tapped for

 

the last-minute job,” Grigg said.

 

Agronsky Sees U. S. Land War

(Continued from page 1)

interfering in the internal affairs
of other nations whenever we feel
like it simply goes, moreover, against
the principles of the American peo-
ple.

Instead Agronsky suggested that
the U.S. position in Viet Nam is
not nearly so hopeless when the
history of American foreign policy
since World War II is considered.
He noted a number of instances in
which the American government has
reversed its course after setting a
policy, including attempts just after
the war to drive the Russians out
of the U.N., switching its backing
from one group to another in the
Dominican Republican crisis, aban-
donment of the NATO Multilateral
Fleet concept in Europe, and with-
drawal from the Bay of Pigs crisis,
And after each of these changes of
policy, Agronsky noted, “the Re-
publie survived.”

Comparing American policy in the

i war to a man shouting down a well
/ and able to hear his voice, Agronsky

over Lexington would not dupli- | #84in quoted Sen. Fulbright, who

said, “What is truly unwise is to
fail to have the courage to change

/a policy that is wrong.”

 

Agronsky criticized the doctrine
of infallibility of foreign policy by
asking, “Since when is it wrong to
ask if our country may be wrong?”

There are no perfect, absolute,
answers, he said, but he suggested
that a feeling of tolerence and re-
spect among men and nations and
a belief in reason rather than force
as an answer to problems may at
least be the road to hope.

Agronsky’s 26 years in broadcast
journalism have been divided be-
tween ABC (14 years), NBC (10
years) and now CBS, where he
worked since April, 1964, as a Wash-
ington correspondent.

 

Mrs. Ruby Norris Elected
Advisory Group Chairman

Mrs. Ruby L. Norris of George
Wythe High School in Richmond,
Va., was elected chairman of the
SIPA Advisory Committee for
1966-67 during the Advisor's Lunch-
eon Friday in Evans Dining Hall.

She succeeds Mrs. James D. Hein-
line of Radford (Va.) High School
as chairman of the 18-member com-
mittee which advises SIPA on
policy matters.

 

Grigg advised his audience to seek
a broad education, to challenge ideas,
and question answers.
“Read, become informed, and ex-
amine,” he said.
W&L Graduate

Grigg, a native of Washington, D.C.
graduated from Washington and Lee
University in 1956.

He returned to Washington as a
writer for The Star thereafter, went
to work later with Science Service,
and finally became science editor of
The Star several years ago.

 

John Jennings
Plans Program
For Convention

in 1956 where he was senior edi-
tor of Home Edition, the student-
operated radio broadcast, and execu-
tive producer of Kaleidoscope, the
series of weekly programs designed
to explore and develop the creative
use of the broadcasting medium. Last
summer he pursued graduate study
at Stanford University.

In 1956, he received the Sigma
Delta Chi Outstanding Journalism
Award.

Worked for WDBJ

His experience with the radio
medium is extensive. After gradua-
tion from W&L, he worked for
WDBJ radio in Roanoke, Va., and—
while serving in the U.S. Army—
was involved in the Armed Forces
Network broadcasting from Stutt-
gart, Germany, in 1956-58.

In 1958, he returned to WDBJ and
the following year became instruc-
tor and director of the Communica-
tions Laboratory at Washington and
Lee.

During the 1964 Presidential elec-
tion, Jennings was placed in charge
of gathering Virginia's returns for
the Columbia Broadcasting System.

Presently, he is engaged in es-
tablishing an FM station in Reid
Hall, to be controlled and operated

 

by W&L students under his super-
Vision.

Consideration
Of Cartooning
Is Suggested

with a chalk moustache and beard to
correspond with the character in his
sketch.

Among other sketches he did were
the effect of inherited genes on hu-
man facial characteristics, a WAC
taking a bath while wearing her
helmet, and another of his syndicated
subjects, “Little Iodine,” saying, “Hi,
SIPA!”

Dunn also told the delegates that
cartooning, which he said has en-
joyed an illustrious career, is be-
ginning to penetrate more thoroughly
the television industry and advertis-
ing. He urged potential artists to
consider cartooning as a field.

890 Newspapers
Dunn is probably best known for
his two cartoon features, “They'll
Do It Every Time” and “Little Io-
dine,” which are distributed to more
than 800 newspapers by King fea-

tures Syndicate.

Dunn attended St. Anselm’s Col-
lege in Manchester, N. H., where he
first became interested in cartooning.
Afterwards, he spent three years at
the Art Students’ League in New
York City.

In 1933, Dunn joined Hearst's
International News Service as a cub
reporter. Six months later, he began
cartooning with King Features Syn-
dicate. He allied himself with Jimmy
Hatlo and Milt Goss, the two car-
toonists whose work, he says, influ-
enced him most. He worked closely
with Hatlo and succeeded him when
he died in 1963.

Over the years, Dunn has had two
television programs, “Face to Face”
“Quick on the Draw,” and has filled
numerous speaking engagements.
He is also a member of the famed
New York theatrical club, The
Lambs.

Kendrick and Wade Win;

Steinger & Nash Elected

By JOHN CARRERE
The fervor and excitement of the last week was finally
climaxed last night with the announcement of election results.
President Fred Mindel read Monday’s tallies to a small group
of candidates and supporters gathered in the Student Union.
With the addition of seven victorious candidates, next year’s
Executive Committee has now been nearly filled. The election

of one freshman

undergraduate and law

be held early next fall. The student

government of 1965-67 now stands

at 10, the student body officers hav-

ing been previously elected.
Seniors

The rising senior made
close race with its candidates. Sev-
enty-four per cent of the Juniors
saw Bryant Kendrick as a favorite
with a majority of 100 votes. Ken-
drick will be serving his second
term since he was on the E.C. as
a sophomore. Alan Wade, Phi Kap,
will be the other E.C. member, re-
ceiving a total of 88 votes. These
two won over Randy Chitwood and
Mike Saunders, who polled 82 votes
apiece.

Incumbents Lane Steinger, ZBT,
and Richard Nash, Beta, made good
their bids for the junior class rep-
resentatives. Nash, who won with
an impressive 188 votes, will be
making his third appearance on the
E.C., having won also in his fresh-
man year. Jody Kline suffered the
closest setback of the E.C. races, los-
ing to Steinger by a six-vote mar-
gin, 116-110. Dave Johnson finished
with 70 votes. Eighty-four per cent
of therising Juniors cast votes.

Sophomores

Next year the sophomore class
will see new representatives in the
E.C. Doug Hall, Beta, and Fran
Lawrence, Phi Psi, ran out ahead
of the other candidates with 149 and
146 votes, respectively. Defeated in
the race were Pleas Geyer, 126, and
Sam Hinkle 115. The rising Sopho-

Troubs ‘“Three Cuckolds”
To Begin This Wednesday

The Troub Theater began accept-| and decrepit old men of the title. |

Handley,

ing reservations yesterday for its
final production of the 1965-66 sea-
son, The Three Cuckolds, which will
be given tomorrow through Satur-
day.

The reconstruction by
theater historian Leon Katz of an
anonymous 16th century commedia
dell'arte scenario, dealing with the
conspiracies and love affairs of three
old men and their wives, aided and
abetted by the rogue Arlecchino. In
keeping with the loose, freewheel-
ing spirit of the commedia, director
Lee Khan and the cast of six men
and three women have staged the
show with complete disregard for
the laws of realism and subtletly; the
production is pure, fantastic, broad
sex farce.

Jay Cady is featured Arlec-
chino, a role which requires him to
assume a wide variety of outland-
ish and hilarious accents ranging
from Minnie Pearl to Foghorn Leg-
norn and to perform a taxing
of gymnastics.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che KRing-tum Phi
Damn Well Ought To Be

When the Washington and Lee of ten or fifteen years ago
is compared to the University as it is today, the most noticeable
disparity is the change in the student-faculty relationship. As
the year closes, it seems appropriate to offer some comments on
this widening gulf between students and faculty.

Dean Emeritus Frank J. Gilliam is fond of explaining his
title in the following manner: ‘Emeritus can be broken down
into its two Latin roots; e, meaning ‘out,’ as in ‘out of a job,’
and meritus, meaning ‘damn well ought to be.’ ”’ Dean Gilliam
while certainly not yet out of a job, represents for us what the
history and tradition of the University demand that a faculty
member had “‘damned well ought to be.”

Several students have undertaken to assay just what is
wrong with Washington and Lee, but we believe they have suc-
ceeded in only touching on the periphery of the problem. The
University was considered great on several occasions during the
last century, even when not a pioneer in higher education.
What, then, was responsible for this greatness? We feel it
was great because of its atmosphere and the men it turned
out. Further, we believe that this atmosphere was created and
the human product molded by nothing so much as by the
faculty.

This faculty contribution is powerful, but subject to change.
And as it changes, so changes the institution. Washington and
Lee will never be a secluded haven devoted to research and
scholarly meditation, like many larger universities, nor should
it reasonably aspire to this status. Washington and Lee is a
teaching institution, the success of which is predicated upon the
interest in the student displayed by each faculty member. The
greatness of the University, at least in this connection, is de-
pendent therefore on the greatness of each individual profes-
sor.

By no means do we deny student responsibility for the
future and well-being of the University. They must feel a com-
mitment to both the institution and the faculty, just as the
faculty must be involved with them and the University. Never-
theless, the burden falls primarily on the faculty, and not on
the students who are only their “temporary” colleagues.

Great teachers are those who exercise the greatest con-
structive influence upon their students; who take a personal
interest in their lives, other than the perfunctory concern
necessitated by falling grades or rules infractions. These great
teachers are friends to their students: they are knowable as
well as knowledgeable and do not disdain to descend from their
ivory towers of academic aloofness. This must not be inter-
preted, however, as a mandate for some of the molly-coddling
and spoon-feeding in which some teachers persist, and which
may be as much an evil as no contact at all.

This great teacher is slowly vanishing from Washington
and Lee. We submit that even now there are more nine-to-five,
workaday teachers at Washington and Lee than we can safely
afford. Happily, these distant faculty members are a minor-
ity; a minority which insists upon its right to isolation. But
this right is invalid, and cannot be protected.

What can be done toremedy this aloofness? To be sure
there is no pressure to publish-or-perish, and the system of
departmental advisers for majors contribute to increased
student-faculty contact. But programs such as the freshman
advisers badly need overhauling, and the entire concept of
assigning advisers must be reevaluated. However, the final
solution is not to be found in these measures. Reform can only
come from the top.

Students really do want to be friends with their professors,
and do very have a real desire to know and be known by their
deans and administratiors. In too many instances, though they
are denied this beneficial association which has so well served
their University for so long.

It is their earnest wish, we believe, to become acquainted
with their President and the deans. They want to be proud
of their school, yet how can they when there is no opportuni-
ty to identify with its leadership? Students are singularly un-
impressed by the organizational capability of the men run:
ning the University. They cannot appreciate administrative
skill; they are impressed only by a knowable, flesh-and-blood
human whom they can like. But there appears to be a reluct-
ance on the part of Administration to establish this relation-
ship. Whether restrained from doing so by personal shyness,
lack of time, or even a vague fear of the students’ reaction,
they do have a very definite responsibility to make them-
selves available and approachable, which surely must take pre-
cedence.

It rests with the faculty to resolve this identity crisis. They
must decide whether the extra effort is to be expended to pre-
serve the Washington and Lee which is slowly disappearing.
This characterictic personal relationship between student and
teacher, based on friendship and mutual respect, must be re-
initiated by the faculty; the students’ fear of being obsequious
is too considerable for it to be otherwise. By the same token,
the students must examine their motives and aims in relation
to the faculty. Many faculty members shy away from involve-
ment with students because of the apple-polishing tendency of
some to view relations with the faculty as only another oppor-
tunity to impress the teacher for a grade.

 

We sincerely hope that the great teachers at W&L are not

members of a dying species. Their passing should be an ignoble
waste, especially since the tradition they represent has pros
pered in harder times than these. If nothing else be accom-
plished at Washington and Lee, at least we should preserve
this ideal of the faculty as it had “damn well ought to be.”

Oldest W&L Tradition Is Questioned By EC Member

The following are the results of
a poll taken this past week. The

iors in three different fraternities,
one perennially among the best fra-
ternities academically, one consist-
ently at the bottom, and the third
usually somewhere in the middle.

*7—No answer.

About the Poll
Perhaps the first thing which needs
to be said is that this poll is not of-
fered as an infallible measure of stu-
dent opinion. There are a number
of criticisms which might be made,
not the least of which are the sub-
jective nature of the questions and
the comparatively small number of
those polled. Although the poll has
these and other limitations, there are
a number of conclusions which
might nevertheless, be adduced.
Principal among these is that the
honor system is in sufficient trouble

to warrant our attention.

Question No. 1

The first question is rather aca-
demic; simply, “Have you commit-
ted a violation of the honor sys-
tem as it is generally defined?” I
don’t think that anyone can fairly
deduce from the responses to this
question that our honor system is
“dead,” that most students merely
pay lip service to it. All that the
answers to question number 1 indi-
cate is that Washington and Lee
student is like every other student,
that he will upon occasion succumb
to temptation, and that like all men,
he is not endowed with an “abso-
lute” sense of honor.

Question No. 2

The second question (“Have you
violated what you conceive to be
the spirit of the honor system?) in-
dicates, I believe, that many stu-
dents do not think that all techni-
cal breaches of the honor system
should be considered violations, that
there is considerable difference be-
tween a flagrant violation of honor
and a relatively minor one, But
there is one disconcerting note in
that better than twenty per cent
of those polled believe there to be
no underlying spirit to the honor
system. Whether this is attributable
to a feeling of disillusionment with
the honor system or with opposition
to the principle of a honor system
is difficult to determine.

Third and Fourth Questions

I think that the responses to these
questions are significant to note.
Although it is extremely difficult to
know if you would or would not
report a close friend of yours for a
violation of the honor system until

26 13

23 16

il

27 15

you are actually confronted with
such a situation. I think that the
results do give cause to pause and
ponder the condition of the honor
system. I do believe that the major-
ity of us are aware of fraternity
brothers or friends who have vio-
lated the honor system and yet have
failed to report such violations. If
the honor system is to work effec-
tively, the student must recognize it
as his to operate, and that its en-
forcement is his responsibility alone.

Idealistically, the student ought to
conceive of honor as a transcendent
value taking precedence over person-
al friendship. The student simply
cannot punish dishonor in one quar-
ter and ignore it altogether in an-
other. Responsibility often implies
tasks which are personally distaste-
ful, but these responsibilities must

(Editor’s Note: Dean Frank J.
Gilliam has been a member of the
Washington and Lee University
administration since 1931. He orig-
inally joined the faculty in 1926
as an assistant professor of Eng-
lish, gaining promotion to associate
professor in 1928.

He became the University’s
Dean of Students in 1931, a posi-
tion he held until February, 1962,
when he asked to devote his full-
time efforts to the Washington and
Lee’s admissions program. Mr, Gil-
liam had been handling admis-
sions for a number of years. He
retired as Dean of Admissions in
June of 1963 and was named Dean
Emeritus by the University’s Board
of Trustees. He still serves the
University in an advisory capaci-
ty.)

In a recent interview with the
Ring-tum Phi Dean Frank J. Gil-
liam gave his opinions on some re-
cent developments on the Washing-
ton and Lee campus and on changes
that have occurred in students sen-
timents.

Initially, in a discussion of the
proposed independent study plan,
he gave a mild endorsement to the
program. “By and large, if a col-
lege can have such a program for
a limited number of competent stu-
went, integrated with the regular
degree requirements, it would be a
good thing.”

be discharged nevertheless. The typi-
cal student at Washington and Lee
does not share this view; he does not
conceive it as his duty to demand
“absolute honor from those with
whom he associates. Ironically, how-
ever, he expects a wholly different
code of behavior from those whom
he doesn’t know or personally dis-
likes. There is also this disquieting
implication—that the honor system
may be used to discriminate against
the unpopular few. The honor sys-
is, in effect, suggesting to one group
of persons that they must be more
circumspect in their ethical behav-
ior than another group. Obviously,
this is not a failure of the honor
system, but of those charged with its
administration, without whose co-
operation the honor system cannot

 

possibly survive.

On the topic of integration at
Washington and Lee, Dean Gilliam
remarked that it is “an inevitable
development.” “W&L will, at some-
time in the future, enevitably oper-
ate on an integrated basis, in fact
as well as in theory,” he stated.

Commenting on a recent Ring-tum
Phi column which concerned sub-

Adherence To Honor System Polled

The Fifth Question

The fifth question indicates that
there are a great number of students
who observe violations, but fail to
report them. Since the students
themselves are primarily responsible
for enforcing the honor system, it
would appear that the honor sys-
tem suffers sorely from their failure
to acknowledge their responsibility.

The Sixth Question

Perhaps the most significant re-
sponse was to the sixth question.
Over seventy per cent of the stu-
dents polled indicated that they felt
that the absolute penalty was “un-
just,” and that a modification of the
penalty, which would differentiate
between habitual violators and those
who were suspected of the their
first violations, and between blatant

tions—of not paying students to take
part in athletics was sound; but
that we might well consider paying
a few boys to play football and
basketball. My remark was that it
was reminiscent of the proverbial
young lady who wanted to be only
a tiny bit pregnant.”
Conventional Dress

“On the matter of conventional
dress, I think that everyone who
has been on the Washington and Lee
campus for an extended number of
years would feel that conventional
dress is not one of the eternal
verities of the institution but that it
has been a positive, worthwhile as-
set almost impossible to exaggerate.”
Dean Gilliam continued, “My own
hope is that a sufficient number of
Washington and Lee students, in

Swim Coach, Trainer
To Attend Fla. State

By CHARLIE FRERET

Washington and Lee will soon be looking for a new swim-
ming coach and trainer. Norris Wilder Eastman, who has
filled these two capacities for the past eight years, is leaving
to attend Florida State University next fall to study for his
doctorate in Physical Education.

Coach Eastman is married to the former Beverley Brick and
has three children—Norris, Jr.. Jace-#—-—-
queline, and Scot. Since coming to
Washington and Lee to catch, East-

 

man has become an integral part of
the University. His activities read
like a book. He has been: assistant
professor of physical education; di-
rector of correctives and adapted
physical education; head trainer for
all sports; and organizer and super-
visor of Student Trainer Organiza-
tion. He has been water safety in-
structor trainer, supervisor of W&L
acquatics, head swimming coach,
and director of Physical Fitness Test-
ing Program.

On the teaching side he has been a
lecturer in kinesiology, anatomy, and
Physical Education Techniques, Phil-
osophy, and Programming. He is a
member of the University Student
Health Committee; co-Chairman of
the State of Virginia Advisory Swim-
ming Committee; a member of the
National Trainers Association;
member of AAHPER; and faculty
advisor to the Dance Board.

A standout at Lawrence High in
football, baseball, and basketball in
Falmouth, Massachusetts, Coach
Eastman became a fine swimmer at

Outstanding Seniors
Bow Out At WG L

 

Since arriving on the W&L cam-
pus, Dave Kirkpatrick has develop-
ed into an out-
standing athlete.
The son of Mr.
» and Mrs. F. Syn-
| dor Kirkpatrick of
| Madison, New
Jersey, Dave came
from Madison
High where he
was a standout in
both baseball and
soccer. He made
both varsity
squads his fresh-

Kirkpatrick
man year at W&L, but it wasn’t un-
til his sophomore year that be began
to make a name for himself.

In the fall of 1963 he won a start-

ing position on the soccer team,
proving a valuable asset; and in the
spring he took over
the baseball team, leading the team
in stolen bases and batting with a
390 average.

In his junior and

senior years

Dave has continued his fine record. |
During his Junior year he paced the |

soccer team to a second place in the

NCAA tournament, and was chosen |

for All-Virginia second team. This

shortstop for |

|e started strong in baseball his
| Junior year but was released before
the CAC tournament. Determined to
make amends he came back this
spring and has once again proved
his worth.

Coach Joe Lyles has been Dave's
coach in both sports and is high
in his praise of Dave’s abilities. He
feels that Dave is one of the best
players he has had at W&L. He
thinks Dave’s fine soccer ability as
a dribbler and a breaker can be
attributed to his “tremendous body
balance,” speaking of Dave as con-
tinually a threat with the ball be-
cause he has “dynamite in both
feet.” In baseball Coach Lyles calls
Dave a good line-drive hitter who
seldom strikes out. Dave's rifle
arm enables him to make difficult
plays look easy at short.

Dave is a member of Pi Kappa
| Alpha and a European History ma-
jor. He has been on the Dean’s List
|and would like to attend W&L Law
School, but upon graduation he is
due to receive his commission in
the Marine Corps, to be stationed
at Quantico. Dave ends his athletic
career with the C.A.C. tournament
|in St. Louis.

Mathews, Crosland
Top Golf Performers

By RAY ZELTNER
Although not playing up to expectations, the Washing-

State Intercollegiate Golf Tournament at the Cascades in Hot

Leading the team were Captain Ed Crosland and Freshman

Bobby Mathews, shooting 164’s. They were followed by Junior

Lacrosse Lost

Saturday on a rain-soaked Wilson
field, the Washington and Lee la-
crosse team was defeated by a pol-
ished squad from Washington Col-
lege, 18-4. The score is a deceptive
one; the Generals battled the visitors
into the third quarter before a sud-
den barrage of goals by Washington’s

star attackman put the game out of
reach. Coach Swan lauded the
squad’s first half performance as

the finest effort by
recent years.

Billy Andrews led the charge
which had the visitors awe-struck
with a meagre 4-2 halftime lead. It

was Andrews who scooped up a ball
early in the third period and raced
in to rally the Generals’ third goal.
However, the relentless attack of
second-team All-American Jaegar,
high-scoring Ren Regan, and Ort-
man, devastated the tired Generals in

 

the final periods.

the third consecutive year by V.P.L,
with U.Va. and V.M.I. taking sec-
ond and third. V.P.I.’s Tim Collins
was the individual medalist with a
two-over-par 144. Considering the
rainy weather, which has plagued
six of the last seven matches, the
scores were reasonably low.
Friday Victories

Last Friday the golf team scored
victories over Lynchburg and Roa-
noke College in a tri-match at the
Lexington Country Club. Mathews
led the team scoring with 72. Cros-
land and Fulwider followed with

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Edward Brooke May Be Elected

(Continued from page 2)
“No” to the K.K.K,

Mr. Brooke, a self-proclaimed Re-
publican “liberal” in terminology
that since November of 1964 has be-
come almost devoid of meaning, has
“a gift for political service,” says
one observer who would rather
speak of a “Keating” or even a
“Javits” type Republican than a “lib-
eral.” Brooke’s capabilities cannot be
denied. His ability is recognized by
Democrats as well as Republicans;
under his leadership, Massachusetts
has been “cleaned up” more exten-
sively and more effectively in the
three-plus years past than through-
out the rest of the century.

Neither can his sympathies be re-
jected. His vigorous refusal to sup-
port Goldwater-Miller in ’64, his
statement that “I don’t believe I'd
care to be endorsed by the Ku Klux
Klan, nor will I go out of my way
to get the blessings of the Com-
munist party are demonstrative of
his political independence, of the at-
titude finally being recognized as
essential to two-party politics in New
England.

Brooke is more than a symbol of
new Republicanism in New England;
he is showing that now “you don’t
need Mayflower ancestral creden-
tials; you don’t have to be a mem-
ber of the Somerset Club or even
the Chamber of Commerce, to win
in the Republican party.” He has
moved up from scorn because of his
African and Indian ancestry, to the

retiring, I have not felt an obligation
to look at a copy of the Southern
Collegian in the past three years.
For several years preceding, I had
seen little in the Southern Collegian
that I thought justified its existence.

Continuing his discussion of the
student publication situation, Dean
Gilliam concluded that he thought
the Ariel had shown itself to be a
publication worthy of financial sup-
port by the University.

presidency of the Boston Opera
Company and general respect in all
of New England.

“For All the Peoples”

Perhaps the telling point of
Brooke’s political attractiveness is
his personal victory over the inevi-
table “Uncle Tom-ism” charge
brought early in his career. “Of
course I am a Negro, and I have a
great deal of pride in my race. But
I see myself as the attorney general
for all the peoples; the moment I
become specifically a Negro attorney
general, I squander whatever effec-
tiveness I might have....” There is
little room for retort.

Edward William Brooke will be
the Republican party’s most interest-
ing candidate this fall; more import-
antly, he will undoubtedly be one of
the strongest, personally and politi-
cally, that the party can offer. His
candidacy in itself, and his far-from-
remote chance of victory are prov-
ing to be not only vital and refresh-
ing for Massachusetts Republican-
ism, but also an example in repair-
ing and renovating the G.O.P.
throughout New England.

ways for the worse. My opponent,
as we all know, has not yet spoken
to this side of the question at all.

“When I am elected I want you all
to know that I will take appropriate
action. You have my word on that.

“We have before us many issues
of importance. Junior year abroad.
Independent study plan. Integration.
I propose to combine these noble
goals, and to integrate and send the
Negroes abroad for Inedependent
study.

“My friends, back a winner. I am
not unmindful of the future. Nor of
the past. Nor of the present. Vote
for the Forward-Backward ticket to
help make Washington and Lee what
it is today.”

With this platform, my friend, po-
litical success is yours. And what

 

could be more important?

 

Andrew Is Subject Of Article

(Continued from page 3)
One of the most unrecognized,
outstanding Senior athletes is Jamie
Andrew. The son
— of Mr. and Mrs.
T. G. Andrew of
Baltimore, Md.,
Jamie came to
Washington and
Lee from Gilman

School in Balti-
more, where he
amassed twelve

in football, wrest-
ling, and lacrosse.

Starting with his
Freshman year
Jamie has compiled quite a record
at W&L. He has played three years
of varsity football after a year on
the freshman team. He has wrestled
for four years and was co-captain
this past year. Jamie also played
freshman lacrosse but decided to
forego it after his first year. Yet, now
he helps to coach the lacrosse “B”
team.

Jamie, an avid sailor and a health
bug (he goes to bed by 9:30 p.m.),
has maintained a Dean’s List aver-
age. He is also social chairman of
Delta Tau Delta. But his most out-
standing achievement is the un-
selfish work he has done at the
Waddell Elementary School here in
Lexington. Jamie is a phys. ed.
instructor there and devotes every
afternoon for “his boys.” Jamie has
been like a father to these boys and
his work has begun what may some-
day be called a Boy's Club in Lex-
ington.

violations and relatively minor ones,
would be preferable.
The Seventh Question

The answers to the seventh ques-
tion suggest a possible solution to
the problems previously uncovered.
Over sixty per cent of the students
indicated that they would be more
willing to report violators if the
penalty to be meeted out were less
severe. Of the thirty per cent who
replied “no,” many simply would not
turn in violators under any circum-
stances, while to some the nature
of the penalty would make little or
no difference.

The Absolute Penalty

It would seem, therefore, that the
problem of our honor system cen-
ters primarily around the absolute
penalty. It is obvious that the ma-
jority of students considers it too
severe, especially for persons com-
miting their first violation. The ab-
solute penalty appears to be the
principal reason why a large percent-
age of the student body refuses to
fulfill their obligations under the
honor system. Based simply on the
results of the poll, it appear that
the student body would be more
willing to discharge their respon-
sibilities if a modification of the ab-
solute penalty were to be made.

is the determination of the amount

this aspect of the program.

In an interview with Coach East-

was a particularly hard one to make.
Although he regrets leaving Wash-

Lee Reveals Honor System Poll

Some will doubtless argue that,
should the absolute penalty be sus-
pended, no deterrant would remain
to discourage students from com-
mitting honor violations. This would,
prima facie, appear to be a legitimate
contention, but I tend not to think
so. First, it has been established that
someone does not violate a law or
convention unless there is a reason-
able chance that he will not be
caught. The individual rarely re-
flects on the severity of a punish-
ment, but on the possibility of be-
ing detected and reported. Each step
which maximizes the individual’s
chances of being reported helps to
discourage honor vilations, and a
modification of the absolute penalty
would seem to accomplish this.

(Bob Lee will continue his an-
alysis of his poll next week, with
an examination of “The Abso-
lute Penalty.”

Executive Committee Elections

(Continued from Page 1)

Gil Faulk was victorious in the
law school and will likewise be on
the E.C, next year.

The present Executive Committee
also had some success on Monday.
Its amendment concerning write-in
ballots passed the student body with
a 689-122 count. This action was
spurred by the recent doubt raised
during the student body presidential
election which saw president-elect
Bill Jeffress opposed by a number
of such votes.

The council’s new members will
not enter their terms officially until
next year. However, it is customary
for next year’s E.C. to meet and
shape policies which would be fol-
lowed next fall. Their most imme-
diate concern will be the appoint-
ment of students to the four stand-

 

ing committees: the Library Commit-
tee, The Student Control Committee,
the Assimilation Committee, and the
Cold Check Committee. This will
be done sometime next week.

 

Notice

Dean Pusey’s office has announced
that returning students must register
for both semesters next year on
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
of next week.

Dean Farrar Announces 342 Freshmen Accepted

Director of Admissions James D.
Farrar announced this week that
342 students have confirmed their ac-
ceptances at W&L, to enter this
September as the Class of 1970.

“As best I can feel,” Farrar told
the Ring-tum Phi, “this fall’s enter-
ing freshman class is one of our
strongest ever.” A specific profile of
mean College Board scores, public-
private secondary school distribu-
tion, and North-South geographical
representation will not be completed
until the beginning of the summer,
he added, but aside from the un-
usually impressive academic calibre
of the class, he does not expect that
these characteristics will change
greatly.

A total of 1,412 completed appli-
cations were received this year—
from “students sending in their ten
dollars,’ not merely the letters of
enquiry that some colleges consider
“applications.” This year’s figure is
some eleven per cent below last

WEEKEND WEATHER

Mostly fair skies through tomor-
row, with a low tonight of between
52 and 67; cooler tomorrow, with
a high of from 72 to 77. The outlook
for Sunday: some cloudiness, and
cool.

 

year’s when some 1,599 students ap-
plied. “When the number of appli-
cations was down a bit in February,”
Farrar said, “I began checking,” and
found a similar pattern showing up
at most colleges and universities in
the South and Northeast, including
UVa., Davidson, Vanderbilt, Mary
Washington, and the Ivy League
Schools.

Dean Farrar attributed the slight
decrease in numbers of applicants
to a levelling-off, “or perhaps an
actual decrease,” in the size of this
year’s high-school senior class in
general, due in turn to a drop in the
birth rate in the late forties.

A marked increase in the quality
of secondary school guidance coun-
selling is an equally important ex-
planation, Farrar continued. Coun-
sellors are no longer, it seems, urg-
ing students to apply to schools at
which they have no_ reasonable
chance of acceptance. Multiple ap-
plications, which “give admissions

 

directors nightmares” to begin with,
are being played down. Where a stu-
dent just a few years ago might
apply to six or seven schools, he
now is encouraged to select three
or four “more realistic” choices.

The war in Viet Nam does not ap-
pear to be a factor in W&L’s ap-
plications decline, he said. “The
calibre of students for admittance
to W&L are not in general affected
by the draft.” The war is, however,
being cited by some other colleges
in explaining their declines. “We
simply are receiving fewer and
fewer applications from weak stu-
dents.”

Beginning in March, the Admis-
sions Committee sent out 625 let-
ters of acceptance, compared with
635 last year. Of the 342 students
who confirmed by Monday of this
week, which was the Candidates’
Acceptance Date agreed upon by
most colleges in the country, 330

Magyar Editor
Here Monday

Ivan Boldizsar, editor of The Hun-
garian Quarterly, will speak on “The
Image of the United States in Hun-
gary and Vice Versa” Monday, May
9, at 8 p.m., in Reid Hall 203.

In addition to being a journalist,
Mr. Boldizsar is a distinguished
novelist and playwright. He is Depu-
ty President of the Hungarian PEN.
Club, and member of the Council of
Societe Europeenne de Culture.

He was born in Budapest in 1912.
His literary career began in the
thirties, when he participated in
what was called the “village re-
search movement,” which endeavor-
ed to inform and arouse public
opinion on the living conditions of
Hungary’s “three million beggars.”
This movement inspired his first
book, Tibore, published in 1936, a
collection of the biographies of thirty
landless peasants.

After the war, Mr. Boldizsar was
editor of several newspapers and
weeklies. For a time ,he served as
Under-Secretary of State in the
Hungarian Foreign Ministry.

In recent years, he has produced
three novels, From This Morning
to Tomorrow Morning, Night's End,
and Birthday, plus several volumes
of short stories, plays, and film
scenarios.

Mr. Boldiszsar refers to his two
latest editions, Relatives and Strang-
ers and Doing England with a Gi-
raffle, as diaries. Both have been
best sellers.

His most recent drama, Bread and
Wine, dealing with marriage and
friendship at the time of the Sham
Political Trials during the Stalin
period, will be produced in Buda-
pest this year.

He is the first Hungarian transla-
tor for Franz Kafka, and has also
translated works by Aldous Huxley,

The junior-class prose Award went
to Ward Briggs, from Montchanin,
Delaware, for his second consecu-

describes the relationship between a
man and woman over a period of
thirty years—from childhood,
through early adulthood, and into
maturity. Stuart described its theme
as “domination and denial.”

Steve Greenia, of Charlotte, North

of a young boy's day with his grand-
father, and how they became friends
beyond their bleod relationship as

EC Eliminates Assimilation Fines,
Will Expand Role of Orientation

The newly elected EC. met
Wednesday night to set Committee
policy for next year.

The E.C. by a unanimous vote
adopted a comprehensive change in
Assimilation Committee policy to
go into effect in September.

Steve Saunders appeared before
the committee to submit a proposal
for a reorganization of the Assimi-
lation Committee. Kirk Follo pre-
sented the “Traditions Committee”

proposal, which had been considered
and rejected by a 6-5 vote by the
E.C. in March. Saunders proposed
that the A.C. take comprehensive
and full responsibility for freshman
orientation and enforce the tradi-
tions during the rest of the year
through encouragement and, ulti-
mately, through fines and possible
stronger action. To orient freshmen,
Saunders proposed that the A.C.

In order to further Washington and

to buy sight unseen every rumor

State’s Attorney
Defines 3.2 As

Virginia's Attorney General Reb-
ert Y. Button ruled this week that
the sale of 3.2 beer on Sundays in
Craig County is legal, although a
county ordinance specifically pro-
hibits it,

The potential effect of the ruling
is considered to be far wider-
reaching than in Craig County
alone. One prominent W&L faculty
member has commented, “this is
ene of the few decent rulings from
My, Button.” A spokesman for the
Acoholic Beverage Control beard
stated that localities cannot in fact
limit or restrict the sale of 3.2
beer at all, because according to
Commonwealth law — lew-proof
beer is considered to be non-aleo-
holie

if the ruling should be brought
into effect in Rockbridge County,
then beer could be sold unres-
trictedly met only on Sundays, but
also afier the 11.00 pm. end of
the alegholic-beer-selling day: and

His proposals also provide that there
be no reporting system of dress vio-
lations, but that committee members
could call before them frequent vio-
lators and fine them, if necessary.

The “Traditions Committee” pro-
posal provided that the A.C. should
serve to orient freshmen at the be-
ginning of each year and should
continue during the year to encour-
age the traditions, calling frequent
violators before it if it desired. There
would be no reporting system of
violations. In this proposal, how-
ever, the A.C. would have no re-
course to fines or punishment of
any kind.

Vice-President Kirk Follo moved
that the E.C. adopt the essentials
of the Traditions Committee propos-
al, but to incorporate into it Saun-
der’s idea of an expanded role for
the A.C. in freshman orientation.
The specific methods of this expand-
ed role were left to be determined
at a meeting next week. Therefore,
there will be no fines or enforeement
next year.

Richard Nash moved that the E.C.
put no limit on the number of stu-
dents to be appointed to the A.C.

unanimously.

In other action, the E.C. decided

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

Friday Edition

An Unfortunate Start

During its first official meeting, the newly-elected Executive
Committee virtually destroyed the Assimilation Committee as
a means of effectively maintaining Washington and Lee tradi-
tion.

To quote the official E.C. notice “no fines will be imposed
on violators but (Assimilation) Committeemen will meet with
frequent violators to secure their co-operation, through persua-
sion only, with the tradition.” We find this statement either
incredibly naive or incredibly cynical.

An Assimilation Committee reduced to the function of
“encouraging” miscreant students will probably be a farce, and
it will almost certainly be ineffective. Futhermore, the new
E.C. has totally abrogated the recent policy set by the outgoing
1965-66 E.C., without giving that policy the slightest chance
to prove itself one way or another.

In so doing, the new E.C. has compromised the Executive
Committee as a reliable and continuous institution and has
gone against a majority, however slight, of student body opin-
ion. Furthermore, it has eliminated any real means of en-
forcing conventional dress.

We feel that the new Executive Committee has started its
term of office in an exceedingly unfortunate manner; how-
ever, the quality of its newly-elected members is such that it
will hopefully act with more discretion as it becomes more ex-
perienced.

The Honor System ‘‘Poll”

Another Washington and Lee tradition has come under
attack during the last week. The nominal honor system poll
published last Tuesday by senior Executive Committeeman
Bob Lee is one of the most shocking articles to have appeared
in the Ring-tum Phi in the last four years. It is shocking in
that the writer implicitly presented as fact a series of highly
questionable statistics pertaining to the honor system, and it
is shocking in that if these statistics are at all valid, then Wash-
ington and Lee’s venerable and cherished honor system is in-
deed “in sufficient trouble to warrant our attention.”

 

 

Mr. Lee’s article states that twenty-eight per cent of those
polled admit to having “violated what you conceive to be the
spirit of the honor system.” Over fifty per cent of those polled
claim to have “witnessed an honor system violation and failed
to report it.” Over seventy per cent of those polled consider
“unjust” the absolute penalty for honor violation.

But are these figures accurate? We doubt it. In the first
place, the poll included less than 3 per cent of the student
body. Even such a meager survey might be plausible if taken
impartially and at random, but it was not. Mr. Lee’s poll was
taken of 42 juniors and seniors in only three fraternity
houses. It should not be necessary to point out at length that
W&L fraternities exhibit certain collective characteristics, and
that no three of them could be representative of the general
student opinion.

Finally, the poll’s wording was often ambiguous and sub-
jective. In the case of the first question, for instance, what is
really meant by a violation of “what you conceive to be the
spirit of the honor system?” This question could have meant
several different things, ranging from “Have you cheated?”
to “Do you consider yourself a perfect person?”

It is likely that the poll’s statistics are inaccurate and mis-
leading; nevertheless their publication represents the only sta-
tistics presently available on the state of the honor system.
Dubious as they might be, they are still capable of under-
mining the mutual student-faculty and student-student trust
which now exists on this campus. If only to correct the prob-
able wrong impressions engendered by the poll, it has now be-
come necessary to conduct an objective and campus-compre-
hensive referendum on the honor system.

Margolies Says W&L Lacks Courage
To Adapt Itself To Modern Society

By RICK MARGOLIES

Washington and Lee lacks cour-
age. It lacks the courage to admit
that now that society has changed,
it must change also—or become an
anachronism. It lacks the courage to
apply programs successful at other
institutions to itself—I am _ not
advocating change for the sake of
change but—there ARE  progres-
sive things being done in education
today.

Washington and Lee’s lack of cour-
age results from fear. This fear
be valid and worthwhile change be
cen be labelled don’t rock-the-boat-
ism. Each group fears speaking out
about what it believes would be
valid and worthwhile change be-
cause of the possible disapproval
and reprisals by the group above it.
This results in a fear of change,
starting at the top of the university’s
hierarchy and permeating down-
ward. I am sure that President Cole
is aware of what is going on in edu-
cation today and I am even confi-
dent that has seen the potentialities
for worthwhile change at Washing-
and Lee. So why is he silent? Why
no public statements? Why does he
not get involved with student affairs?
I can only conclude, assuming that

he is aware of the potentialities, that
he fears what the conservative Board
of Trustees might say or do if he
speaks his mind. If this be the case,
and I and others believe that it is,
then I can only second Mr. Sen-
nott’s recent suggestion that he re-
sign. A leader must lead,
Faculty’s Fears

Similarly, the faculty fears the
Administration, the Board and public
opinion. Faculty members don’t get
“involved” because they are too
concerned with their own tenure
and personal prestige. I am confi-
dent that the faculty, drawn from
many parts of the country and itself
educated at diverse colleges and uni-
versities, has also seen the possibil-
ities for constructive change at
the university. Yet no voice is
heard. For example, when was the
last time that a faculty member
wrote to the newspaper, which at
most schools is a sounding board for
ideas, and expressed an opinion on
a matter of the academic communi-
ty’s concern? Are we to assume, for
example, that there is not one opin-
ion either pro or con by a faculty
member as to the proposed fund to
help attract Negro students to Wash-
ington and Lee? I have not heard

 

 

 

one publicly stated faculty opinion.

The student, of course, is the most
fearful member of the community.
This fear stems from his all-consum-
ing concern with grades, rather than
with making himself an aware and
open-minded individual. If the lat-
ter were truly his objective he would
constantly be involved in issues of
university concern, not to mention
the current issues facing society gen-
erally. But unfortunately, the stu-
dent is too concerned with self-
gratification and self-advancement to
get involved. If he holds an opin-
ion he resists the urge to express
it for fear of alienating his profes-
sors, whom he believes might alter
his grades if he “offended” them.

Merely Perpetuating

This fear to speak out, to take a
stand, this don’t rock-the-boat atti-
tude has a very bad effect on the
university: 1) it results in a lack
of creative thinking and a lack of
a spirit of innovation among the
faculty and especially in the admin-
istration. The administration, by re-
fusing to innovate and recognize the
value of creative change has stag-
nated this university. Washington
and Lee is standing still, merely per-
petuating the same system and the

Readers Get Things Off Chests

Revive Political Parties?

Friday Ring-tum Phi

Contrary to the attitude expressed

date for President of the Student

First of all, we have seen on cam-

desiring such things as clothes for
the poor of Mississippi and an end
to escalation in Vietnam. We all
know only the Liberal fishes who
desire to undermine our great uni-
versity could have been responsible.
But our gentlemen were quick to
honorably combat the menace: ob-
scenities were written on the signs
and/or they were torn down. There
could be no good listening to non-
gentlemen,

And just this morning it was my
privilege to witness an even more
sign, a series of actions

same values it always has had, while
the world prograsses before its eyes.
It is necessary to challenge values
to see their real worth. But Wash-
ington and Lee perpetuates rather
than challenges. This brings me to
my second point.

2) This fear of innovation has
eaused Washington and Lee to lose
sight of its identity and its purpose.
The administrators have lost sight
of what the university is all about
because they are too deeply invol-
ved in everyday machinations of
running this particular university.
This narrow-mindedness results in
motion without direction .

Role of Fraternities

This narrow-minded approach to
Washington and Lee’s problems was
made most vivid to me recently when
I attended a Self-Study meeting on
fraternities. The first question on
the agenda, what is the role of
fraternities in the goals of this uni-
versity, was quickly passed over
to get to “more important” questions,
such as deferred rush. The first
question, however must be answered,
for it is the basis upon which the
fraternity system exists here, the
basic assumption for all further dis-
cussion of fraternity affairs.

A dean was asked what the actual
role of fraternities is in the goals of
the university and his first response,
offered in jest I am sure, was that
fraternities provided a legal place
for students to drink. When it was
pointed out that students have sexual
intercourse with girls and the uni-
versity doesn’t provide a place for

, that everyone laughed and the dis-
| cussion left the actual roles of fra-
‘ ternities to revert to the narrower
‘and more specific issue of deferred

rush. But again the question was

| raised: what is the roles of fraterni-
| ties in the goals of the university,

to which the dean finally admitted
he did not know and suggested that
possibly the student should tell him!

It seemed to me that this is a good
example of a member of the adminis-
tration losing sight of the goals and
purposes of this university. It is
particularly shocking when you real-
lize the enormity of the incident:
85 per cent of the students belong
to fraternities and spend a major part
of their time enmeshed with them
yet a Dean and several members
of the faculty could not justify their
existence here, except by repeating
several times that they are “an in-
tegral part of the university.” Say-
ing that they are here doesn’t say
whether they should be here.

Lee Syndrome

And what do we have in place of
creative thinking, now that we have
lost sight of the goals of the univer-
sity? We have, gentlemen, the Lee
Syndrome. It arises from the acute
inability to deal with the future
and results in oppressive obession
with the past. It seems that Robert
E. Lee, his horse, his family, and as-
sorted in-laws are buried in Lexing-
ton and for this honor the university
must spend every minute perpetuat-
ing his ideals. These ideals are social
standards of acceptability: be, look,
and act a gentleman. And so the Ad-
missions program looks for socially
acceptable boys, those with courte-
ous reply and neatly-rolled tie. But
a university should be concerned pri-
marily with the state of a person's
mind, whether he is aware and cur-
ious, whether he thinks or just par-
rots back fact—and this is something

that is not reflected in machine-
graded college board tests. If we
stopped emphasizing the social

standards of admissions process and
in the education offered we might
not end up with the homogeneous,
moneyed consumers of La Dolce Vita
we have now. Which is not to say
they are not bright—they are—
but they don't use their potential
to think, they are not intellectually
committed

But to return to the Lee Syn-
drome, I offer the Alumni Magazine
as an example. The main articles
in each concern themselves
with speeches by the president or
faculty (usually about Lee) or the
problems of maintaining the tradi-
tions at Washington and Lee in a
much-changed world. In fact, the
next issue features an article about
the relationship of a certain Lexing-
tonian with Lee himself! I think that
we could learn from the
Johns Hopkins University Alumni
Magazine, which devotes itself solely
to articles of current events and is-

Bridgewater, Old Dominion
Fall to General Racketmen

By JERRY PERLMAN

Washington and Lee’s powerful
tennis team had to come from be-
hind yesterday to edge upset-mind-
ed Old Domiinon 5-4 in a match,
at Lexington. This was the Generals
second win of the week, having
easily downed Bridgewater 9-0 on
Wednesday. These two wins boosted
the racketmen’s record to six and
one, their only loss having been to
UVa. last Friday.

Yesterday’s match was the tight-
est of the netmen’s season, With the
match score tied at 4-4, things were
looking shaky for the Generals as the
number one doubles duo of Tommy
Rueger and Ray Turman dropped the
second set of their match 12-10, hav-
ing won the first set 6-3. But behind
strong serving and precision net play,
Coach Canfield’s freshmen whiz kids
won their third set 6-3, giving Gen-
erals victory number six.

Old Dominion came to Lexington
with a definite handicap. Their
strong number one singles player,
George Consolvo, was nursing a
sprained ankle suffered in a match
on Wednesday and had been dropped
to the number five slot. His injury
was immediately felt, as Rueger easi-

Forces Of Evil
Defeat Batmen

On Tuesday the Generals baseball
team suffered a 12-4 defeat at the
hands of the clutch-hitting Lynch-
burg diamondmen. Although W&L
was out hit only 12-9 the Lynch-
burg men smashed three triples to
tally the victory.

Pitcher Seais led the attack with
two triples and seven RBI's. Tommy
Mitchell, three for four, and Jim
Wilson, two RBI's, were the only
productive Generals.

Coach Lyles said, “We played as
well as they did but just didn’t have
the extra base hits at the crucial
times. That has been our trouble all
year and we have only three boys
hitting over .200.”

Tomorrow the W&L nine jour-
ney to Bridgewater against a team
that earlier defeated them, 2-1. Bill
Rasmussen pitched a fine game and
hurled a five hitter. Lyles hopes for
better hitting support tomorrow.

“At the beginning of the season
it was cold and lately there has
been so much rain that the boys are
having trouble getting any continu-
ity in their games. Tomorrow's game
should be a good one.”

Next Monday the team will host
RPI in a doubleheader starting at
2:30.

The victory was followed by team

win at the number two singles spot
and undefeated freshman Ray Tur-
man’s 6-2; 6-2 triumph at number
four,

What had started as an easy W&L
victory, though, soon became an ex-
tremely tight match. Junior Phil
Thompson, after taking the first set
of his number three singles match,
dropped the next two 6-4; 6-2. Wick
Vellines, holding down number six
slot, could not get his game cranked
up and dropped a 6-1; 6-3 decision;
and Drew Baur, playing number five,
found a rugged Consolvo determined
not to let his injury hamper him,
and the lanky junior from St. Louis
wound up on the short end of a 7-5;
6-0 score.

With the score now tied at three
matches apiece, Canfield sent his
three doubles team onto the courts.
The netters from Norfolk soon
jumped into a 4-3 lead, as the Gen-

like going to bed. But the show must
go on, only by now there’s one less
inch to fill.

Congratulations to basketball coach

has scored another
victory in the re-

By the way, my close association
with Sports Illustrated has paid off
again. About three weks ago I pick-
ed Graustark to win the Derby. Well,
somehow, I feel that he isn’t going
to make it.

When the cavalry charge is over
tomorrow (for those of you who
don’t follow the “Sport of Kings,”

 
  

 

 

that is a reference to the largest field
in years), “Albe’s Hope” has as good
a chance to be in the winner’s cir-

Well, Bill DeWitt seems to have

got somebody,...I think.

But the Orioles got Robby, and
they’re delighted. Between he and
Brooks, very few people remember
the “M Boys.” Just think what Bal-
timore could do if they had Floyd

different Robinson batting second,

might not need three; it seems that

CAMPUS
FASHIONS

By CHIP TOLBERT
ESQUIRE’S FASHION EDITOR

THE TRANSITION T0 SPRING gradually releases us all from our

musty Winter hang-ups. The state-of-seige atmosphere on campus
diminishes as the thermometer rises, and overnight that term paper
you’ve been dreading falls into place. Spring is also the proper time
to think about shifting your wardrobe in the direction of the warm

weather months ahead...

LIGHTWEIGHT, EASY-CARE: these are the

watchwords in tailored apparel. Crisp, cool fab-
rics with built-in wrinkle-resistance and/or per-
manent press features are now standard, The
color story for Spring focuses on BLUEGRASS,
a blend of vibrant blues and sparkling greens.
It should rank as a top color consideration in
selecting all your Spring/Summer apparel. A
pin wale-cord suit, for example, in a lightweight
. cotton/polyester blend, or a classic Natural
Shoulder seersucker suit in a BLUEGRASS
blend are excellent choices. Lightweight, double-
breasted blazers will introduce a whole new
spectrum of colors. But before purchasing, look
ahead: is this a summer geared for absolute
relaxation, a summer job, or, if you're graduat-
ing, your entry into the business world next >
Fall? Make your selection accordingly.

 

“AWAY FROM WHITE” ‘That phrase charac-

 

terizes the gradual phasing out of the classic
white dress shirt. Today, color predominates,
and blue leads the pack. Look also for a wide
range of soft pastel shades, both solids and
stripes; they blend perfectly with the new
Spring suits. Many of these color-toned dress
shirts incorporate permanent press features,
Another trend worth noting: the button-down
collar sans buttons, Collar points are slightly
longer, the buttons disappear altogether, and
the buttonless button-down may be worn with
or without a pin,

ACCESSORIES MAKE THE MAN, and you couldn't get off to a

better start than by selecting one of the new Summer straw hats.
Time was when Memorial Day marked the date for turning in your
winter felt and bringing out your summer straw. Today, any time
the weather's right, the time is right. The classic boater with its
flat top, relatively narrow brim, and colorful ribbon band remains

were Frederick M. Mindel and
Joseph H. Framptom. Univeristy
President Fred C. Cole presented
the awards and gave a brief resume
of both students’ contributions to
Washington and Lee. The award
carries with it a cash stipend of
$100 to be divided between them,
plus an adidtional stipend of $150
to be given to a campus organiza-
tion of their choosing. After the
banquet, Mindel had the following
comment: “I feel that any contri-
bution I have made to Washington

benefits I have received from this
school.”

rather than a traditionally-oriented
conformist.

I offer my criticism out of a faith
in this university. I believe that
Washington and Lee has a great,
unrealized potential and I criticize
not out of a desire to personally in-
sult anyone (I apologize if I have),
but out of a desire to see this uni-
versity get up and start moving. My
comments are purposely general,
for it is a basic problem we face:
the lack of courage to face the fu-
ture, forget the past if necessary and
do some creative thinking about
constructive change. For it is this
very willingness to change which
makes a school great. I leave you
with this thought: if Washington
and Lee is as good as many like to
say, why is it rarely discussed in
educational circles? And why, when
schools very similar to Washington
and Lee are receiving multi-million
dollar grants from the Ford Foun-
dation, are we shunned by this award
for excellence?

In addition to the 625 acceptance

Dean Lewis John, Director of Fi-

nancial Aid, has disclosed that a
total of seventy-three members of
the incoming freshman class will
participate in the University’s schol-
arship and grant-loan programs.
This year, he said, aid has been
awarded virtually in all cases of fi-
nancial need, and in the full amount
of that need.
Four students have been awarded
George F. Baker grants; eleven will
receive Robert E. Lee Scholarships.
Fifty-one entering freshmen have
been named to receive University
loan-and-grant combinations. Three
Rockbridge freshmen will receive
the customary reduction granted to
County students. Additionally, eight
outstanding aid applicants were
given Washington Awards, which are
a token grant of $100 for the fresh-
man year only to students who did
not adequately demonstrate need.
Two National Merit Scholars enter
W&L next year.

Dean John noted that there will
be about five fewer aid recipients in
next year’s freshman class, but he
estimated that the total amount of
money involved will be greater, since
the need per recipient has risen.

Included in scholarship awards this
year for the first time are the gov-

70 will share in $10,000 under the
E.O.G. program. Federal require-
ments state that colleges and uni-
versities awarding these must at least
match with their own funds each
grant; without exception, however,
W&L’'s contribution is significantly
higher than the E.O.G.

Also for the first time, the Uni-
versity has given several students
from Northern states outright schol-
arships, instead of the customary
proportional loan-and-grant. These
represent a parallel to the Lee and
Baker Scholarships, which are re-
stricted to students from Southern
and border states only.

 

Eight Students Produce Films

Eight students are producing and

the introductory motion-picture
course.

The students, Nelson Adams, Jer-

Following the meeting, President

“The newly elected Executive
Committee feels that the Assi-

to the purpose for which it was
originally established. We also be-
lieve, if I may speak for the Com-
mittee, that the traditions can and
should be strengthened by the new
assimilation policy. No longer will a
student who does not believe in the
spirit of conventional dress have to
pay periodic fines for his belief. We
recognize that there will not be as
there is not now, one hundred per
cent adherence to the tradition; we

CONGRESSMAN WELTNER MAKES his point to a full house last night

at duPont Auditorium.

Atlanta Congressman Hits
GOP Southern Reactionartes

By JOE WILSON
News Editor

In a seathing attack upon reac-
tionary Southern Republicans, Con-
gressman Charles L. Weltner last
night in duPont Hall called for
Southern youth to join the Demo-
cratic Party. The Atlanta Democrat
called upon his audience to join
with the party which can solve the

oppressive problems facing the
South.
Weltner acknowledged that the

Democratic Party of Georgia and
probably most Southern States rest-
ed upon the Young Democrats for
organization. Furthermore, the future
for youth is in the Democratic Par-
ty because personal organizations are
falling apart while the need to or-
ganize is increased as the Republi-
cans grow.

Reactionary Republicans

The Democrat compared today’s
Southern Republican Party to the
reactionary Democratic Party of
fifty years ago. The Democrats of
1910 were in reaction to Carpetbag
rule and the Populists, while today
the Republicans are the reaction to
the race issue.

Today's Southern Republicans ery
State’s Rights and are a reversal of
fifty years ago. Weltner does not be-
lieve that economic conservation is
the appeal of Republicans, rather it
is race which has attracted the Mad
Democrats.

“The Democratic Party can’t be
rebuilt by being against anything—

ty of youth must work to solve the
enormous problems which hinder
the South. Most outstanding among
these problems is the race gap be-
tween white and Negro populace.
Today prejudice has made the Negro

The Young Republicans, after hav-
ing offered their services to the
Buena Vista Republican Party sev-
eral weeks ago, have embarked on
an intensive campaign to swing this
heavily Democratic community to
the Republican column. Planning has
begun for both this Spring and the
following Fall previous to the No-
vember elections under the co-lead-
ership of freshmen Art Love and Ned
Driscoll.

Buena Vista

Efforts of the YR’s have been ex-
erted in two areas: a telephone sur-
vey to determine the political lean-
ings of the Buena Vista population
and daily trips to Buena Vista for
the purpose of compiling voter reg-
istration lists. These lists will be
used to compile a card system which
will facilitate future campaign work
in this previously neglected area.

The W&L chapter has received
aid from representatives of the Mary
Baldwin YR Club and has indicated
that they have been promised help
from the YR elubs at Hollins, Sweet
Briar, Randolph-Macon, and possib-
ly Southern Seminary for the Fall
Program.

Fall Program

The Fall program will consist of
a canvass of Buena Vista voters done
by boy-girl two member teams.
Complimenting this effort will be
evening social events and updating of
card system

In addition the club will sponsor
a “Political Action Course” to in-
struct those who are new to precinct
work in the fundamentals and will
be given as the first activity of the
Club in the Fall. Upon completion of
the canvass in the Spring, a voter
registration drive will commence
Finally, one week before the election,

IFC Passes CPA Proposal;

Hinkle Receives IFC Award

By RODDY ROERIGER
The Interfraternity Council last
night named Sam Hinkle the Out-
standing Freshman of the year and
also passed the CPA finance super-
vision program.

Sam Hinkle, a Delt from Shelby-
ville Kentucky, was voted the Out-
standing Freshman of the Year
Award. His qualifications included a
3.0 Grade-Point Ratio, Honor Roll,
Phi Eta Sigma, Freshman Execu-
tive Committee Representative,
freshman football, varsity track,
U.C.A., best pledge in his house, and
a member of two house committees.

The CPA program which was pass-
ed is very similar to the original,
however, this program is on a trial
basis for one year. Basically, it re-
quires each fraternity treasurer to
take his books to a CPA once a
month for an audit. This will insure
that each treasurer is very precise
in his bookkeeping and that he
knows exactly where his fraternity’s
money is being spent. The CPA
program also will provide some sort
of course to teach the treasurers a

Hungarian Says
US Image Good

By AL CEDARHOLM

Ivan Boldizsar, Hungarian novel-
ist and playwright said last night in
a speech at Reid Hall, “There is
nothing like an overall general im-
age of the United State in Hungary
and there is nothing but an overall!
general image of Hungary in the
United States.” The speaker, author
of novels, short stories and plays.
gave a talk entitled “The Image of
the United States in Hungary and
Vice Versa.”

Boldizsar said that the citizens of
the United States are all conscious
of the sections in which they lice.
ie. the deep South, the East Coast
etc. However, in Hungary “this is
nonsense.” Hungary considers us as
one nation, not a federation of see-

 

tions or states.

Boldizsar claimed that we take
many things for granted in this
country. He said that Hungarians

realize the strength and power of the
United States better than the peo-
ple here. Yet even though we com-
mand such a good image in that East
European nation, Boldizsar explained
that four events have hurt our im-
age in the recent past and present

Number one was the assasination
of president Kennedy. He said that
the people of Budapest stopped and
cried on the streets when they heard
the news. They thought what was
coming. They didn't think it could
happen here

On the second hand th
ians could not believe

Hungar-
that someone
eould be killed by an intruder in an
American police station (Oswald)
Thirdly. the Domminican

correct and uniform method of book-
keeping.
Expected Cost

The expected cost of the CPA
Program is from $200 to $300 a year,
depending upon the efficiency of the
treasurer in keeping the books. A
major objection to the CPA pro-
posal was that this is not fair to
fraternities with good treasurers be-
cause they do not need the service.
However, this was countered by the
argument that a fraternity cannot be
guaranteed of a good treasurer al-
ways, and thus it would benefit in
the chance that a weak treasurer
was elected.

Also argued is that if a house has
a good treasurer, the CPA cost may
be greatly reduced, for the CPA
would require an audit only once
every two or three months rather
than once monthly. The program
could be a useful method for the
house to judge the treasurer.

The CPA Program as announced
last night will begin with the 1966-
67 school year. The program wac
proposed last semester.

Last Wednesday, the executive
board of the Young Republicans
journeyed to Randolph-Macon Wo-
man’s College in an effort to bring
the girls’ schools into fuller partici-
pation and closer liaison with the
projects in the Shenandoah Valley.
Under discussion was the W&L pre-
cinct and a planned conference to be
held next Fall at Natural Bridge.

Persons interested in working on
the publicity and campaign commit-
tees have been asked to apply to the
respective committee chairmen, Bill
Meinyk and Art Love. Also, the
membership committee announced
that registration for 1966-67 in the
YR’'s is now underway.

Collegian Given
Final Axe Job

In one of the rare appearances
by a student before the faculty in
a regularly scheduled meeting, Drew
Baur pleaded the case yesterday
for the return of the Southern Col-
legian to official University spon-
sorship.

The faculty refused to reconsider
its action of last February which re-
sulted in the withdrawal of Uni-
versity funds and subsidies from the
Collegian.

Drew Baur represented the Pub-
lieations Board in his appeal. Baud
serves as the president of the Board.
Last year, he was editor of the
Southern Collegian.

Reasons for the withdrawal of
funds as stated at the time of the
action were that the Collegian had
been a source of embarrassment to
the university for a number of years
and that the content of the magazine
had shown a continued decline in
quality and in taste.

Held in New Science 305 and be-
ginning at 4:30 p.m. on Monday, the
short meeting ended barely 45 min-
utes later .

The shout which arose when the
defeat of the Collegian was an-
nounced caused one faculty mem-
ber to comment that it was like the
“roar of a Nazi crowd in Hitler's
Germany.”

Baur’s presentation was the first
item to be presented to the faculty.
Following his presentation, the fac-
ulty discussed the entire Southern
Collegian issue in private.

Particular incidents of bad taste
were pointed out and discussed by
members of the faculty.

In a related action, the E.C. unan-
imously approved the disposition
of the Gilliam Award monies, as re-
quested by the co-recipients, Sec-
retary Joe Framptom and President
Fred Mindel. Each man could des-
ignate some campus group to re-
ceive $75.

Mindel gave both the $75 and the
$50 awared to him personally to
the University, requesting that it be
used to establish a fund for the
“furtherance of racial integration
at Washington and Lee.” This may
include recruitment, scholarships,
cultural enrichment, or anything
thing else, at the sole discretion of
President Cole.

A stern warning
intentional passing of cold checks
and the use of false identification
cards was handed down last night
as well. In two resolutions unani-
mously adopied, the E.C. “strongly
urged” students to refrain from these
two practices. The resolution on
falsifying ages in an attempt to
purchase liquor specifically includ-
ed verbal misrepresentation of age,
in addition to false documents.

It is expected that the new E.C.
will consider again making the in-
tentional passing of cold checks an
honor violation, as it was for many
years. ;

Three of the four student mem-
bers of the joint faculty-student
committee to study the independent
study program were appointed. Bill
Jeffress, Kirk Folle, and Jim Awad
were picked, with the fourth to be
selected by the newly elected Execu-
tive Committee.

The Judicial Board’s Justice

The newly elected IFC Judicial Board has
exhibited in its first action the several injudi-
cious characteristics which make justice only
an infrequent by-product of its decisions. The
case of the Judicial Board vs. Phi Kappa Psi
indicates unmistakably that the IFC must re-
form the procedures of the Judicial Board,
providing for a clear statement of punishable
offenses and a forthright declaration of the
rights of the defendant. Under the present
super-secret arrangement, being accused is in
itself an indication of guilt; the Judicial Board
reasons that if a fraternity is accused, it has
obviously done something wrong.

In its handling of the Phi Kappa Psi case,
the Judicial Board demonstrated its jaded con-
cept of justice. The fraternity was arraigned
on four charges: 1.) having a girl in the chap-
ter house after 2 a.m.; 2.) inciting and abet-
ting a drunken brawl in their parking lot that
same night; 3.) threatening to overturn a
professor’s car; and 4.) hazing the same pro-
fessor, who is a neighbor, by the shouting of
obscenities and noisy behavior at night.

Three representatives of the fraternity
faced the Board to answer the accusations.
As to having a girl in the house after hours,
the girl’s date testified to the contrary. Uni-
versity Proctor Bob Murray had been present
that night, and had later assured the fraterni-
ty president that he did not see any girls in
the house. But Bob Murray was not called. No
witnesses were called.

The drunken brawl turned out to be a
fight between a Delta Tau Delta freshman
and the brother of Phi Psi’s houseboy. Phi
Psis became involved only when the houseboy
started to join in the fight, and all three com-
batants had to be restrained. This was the
source of the complaint. Members of the fra-
ternity broke up the fight; they didn’t start
or participate in it. But the freshman who did
fight was not questioned. No witnesses were
questioned.

Identification of the drunk who threaten-
ed to overturn the professor's car was never
made. It was never established that he was a
Phi Psi, although it was determined that only
one person had ever offered the threat. Five
other fraternities are in the immediate vicinity,
yet the possiblity of it being a member of
another house was not considered. The profes-
sor was not called to testify; a member of the
Board had previously interviewed him, thus
securing his testimony.

Finally, it was conceded that there had been
shouting and disorderly behavior around the
house, but without any intention of persecut-
ing the professor. But was the fraternity’s
leadership notified of this situation previous-
ly? They were not. Were they given an oppor-
tunity to correct it themselves, before being
hauled before the the Judicial Board? They
were not. The professor did not testify at this
point either; he had already been “interview-
ed.” There was no testimony.

Based on these findings, the Judicial Board
found the Phi Phis guilty of conduct unbe-
coming gentlemen. For this nebulous offense,
the fraternity was given “a severe reprimand,”
a $100 fine, and placed on conduct probation
through Openings, 1966.

The Student Affairs Committee meets on
Thursday to review this sentence. As a first
step towards reforming the spotty procedures
of the Judicial Board, we hope the Committee
alters this penalty, at the very least removing
the conduct probation. We agree that a fra-
ternity should be punished for wrong-doing,
but they must enjoy the same rights as a citizen
in a civil court, and must be punished only
for those offenses which can be proved. How
ever, the Board considers such irrelevant facts
as a fraternity’s academic standing, attendance
at IFC meetings, and “general attitude’ in
reaching a decision. This is about as fair as a
trafhe cop considering previous violations in
deciding whether or not to issue a summons.
The cop and the Judicial Board are equally
guilty of ignoring the specific question of
whether or not the offense has been commit-
ted.

This whole mess show that at least two new

additions to the IFC by laws are necessary

First, a set of rules governing fraternity rela-
tions with neighbors and the community. This
must provide penalties for public drunkenness,
excessive noise, disorderly conduct, property
damage and harassment of neighbors. Second,
some tough procedural guarantees for fraterni-
ties brought before the Judicial Board. This
section must include provisions for rules of
evidence, the right to call witnesses and ques-
tion them, the right to be faced with the accus-
er and the right to be tried and judged for

specific violations. Futhermore the conspiracy |"
of silence surrounding the proceedings must ||

be broken up.

We expect the IFC to correct these de-
ficiencies; they surely must realize that the
hard-and-fast ‘justice’ they mete out can be
just as harmful as no punishment at all. We
believe the Judicial Board convicted the Phi
Kappa Psi Fraternity of nothing so much as
being Phi Psis. The complaints must be sat-
isfied, but a punishment not justified by the
provable facts will not suffice. The IFC is
mature enough to realize that these rights
must be extended to its member fraternities.
Guilt must be proved, and then punished.
A fraternity must be guilty beyond a reason-
able doubt; it is no longer acceptable to con-
vict merely on the suspicion that the defen-
dant is not innocent.

The Lee Poll

While we join with the Friday Edition in
feeling that a comprehensive poll of the stu-
dent body on the honor system is desirable,
we cannot but disagree with the faulty and
alarmist reasoning which led to this conclu-
sion.

A tradition such as the honor system does
not grow stronger when it is not challenged,
nor does it weaken when it is challenged. Bob
Lee’s poll was straightforward and not at all
an attempt to put something over on the his
readers. He specified the terms of his survey
made all his caveats, and stated his purpose
at the very beginning. Lee did not maintain
that his poll had universal statistical integrity.

We strongly disagree with Lee’s conclu-
sions, and indeed dispute that if the poll sam-
ple were extended the results would show the
laxity about the honor system which Lee be-
lieves to exist. However, his questioning of
the honor system does not constitute an un-
dermining of either the tradition or the Uni-
versity. If such a poll did undermine the “mu-
tual student-faculty and student-student trust,”
then perhaps this trust did not ever really exist.

 

Parking Revisited

As the number of student-owned cars in-
creases, the problem of inadequate parking
space on campus grows more severe. It has
now reached the point when the happy soul
with a 10:15 a.m. class is unable to park any-
where, save in the rutted auto graveyard be-
hind Doremus Gymnasium. And with the
Doremus parking area in its present condition,
our happy soul is lucky if he doesn’t break an
axle,

The parking space in front of Doremus
Gymnasium could be increased by one-third
if the roadway running running along the
building’s northern face were widened, and
a ten foot chunk taken out of the lawn imme-
diately in front of the building. This would
provide parallel parking space for about
twenty additional cars.

Another touch which might make the life
of the student motorist a little easier would be
the painting of white lines to guide his parking,
and conserve space. If lines were once there,
they have disappeared.

Students might be induced to park be-
hind the Gym if the area was regraded, and
some of the hazards to life, limb, and axles
eliminated. The ROTC building is scheduled
to go up on part of the land, but we hope to
see parking facilities improved in the remain-

ing area,

 

Lee Continues Discussion On Honor System

 

Absolute Penalty Supplies No Opportunity
For Violator To Redeem His I ntegrity

By BOB LEE

If my article last week tended to
undermine the mutual  faculty-
student trust at Washington and Lee,
as has been alleged, I am sincerely
apologetic and disappointed. The
poll was not offered as a reflection
of the entire stu-
dent body’s
attitude toward
the honor system.
I thought that I
had made it pat-
ently clear that no
such _interpreta-
tion was intended.

The poll was,
however, an ac-
curate reflection
of the attitudes of
students in three
fraternities toward the honor system,
an attitude which is indeed “shock-
ing.” If the poll succeeded in dem-
onstrating to a few students their
shamefully ambivalent attitudes to-
ward the honor system, if it suc-
ceed in defining the legitimate na-

 

ture of their responsibility under
the honor system, if, indeed, it did
make a few students rightfully in-
dignant, then I confess to no guilt.
The Absolute Penalty

I have concentrated on the abso-
lute penalty partly because I consid-
er it a cruel hoax. We pride our-
selves on the honor system because
we believe it operates successfully
as a result of students’ determina-
tion to see it work. Presumably,
students adhere to the spirit of the
honor system, not out of fear of the
absolute penalty, but out of the con-
viction that the provisions of the
honor system are reasonable and
just. If this is true and the absolute
penalty is not necessary as a deter-
rant, what funetion does it serve?
Ostensibly, the absolute penalty ex-
ists solely as a punitive device, to
be applied to those who cannot sat-
fy the expectations of the commun-
ity. Since the absolute penalty ob-
viously serves no rehabiliatory func-
tion and does not seem to embrace
any appreciable benefit for the com-

Top C-School Graduates

Go To Stanford, Hopkins

By JOHN CARRERE

The Washington and Lee School
of Commerce and Administration has
been one of the tops in its field
for quite a few years. Reputed to
be one of the three best in the
country, the school has sent many
of its graduates through some of the
best graduate colleges.

This June the Commerce School
graduates another strong class. The
graduating seniors will certainly add
to an already lengthy list of out-
standing postgraduate scholars.
Strong performances in the past
ean be especially noticed by consid-
ering graduates who have achieved
a Masters of Business Administra-
tion. Richard McEnally and Skip Es-
sex graduated one-two last year
from the University of North Car-
olina, Frederick Baker, ‘63 graduate
from W&L, finished first at Colum-
bia. Courtney Mauzy (1961) and
Royce Hough (1959) beth ended
up number one in their respective
classes at University of Virginia and
Cornell

eontinue his studies at Stanford for
a Masters of Business Administra-
tion (M.BA.). Also earning a mag-
na cum laude average of 24 were
Frederick Wood and William Wash-
burn. Wood heads Political Science
majors with a 2.557 average. He be-
gins work in September at Johns
Hopkins toward a Ph.D. Leading

munity, it’s sole function is the re-
lease of vindictive energies of the
community. The absolute penalty is
a shameful and pitful act of vengence
directed at those who have already
suffered incalculable shame and dis-
grace,

But there are those who will in-
sist that the absolute penalty is
necessary as a deterrant. What they
contend in effect, is that no honor
system will work effectively unless
some penalty, unimaginably harsh,
exists to “cower” some students into
a sense of honor. Although such a
contention prostitutes the very val-
ues of “the spirit of the honor sys-
tem,” it is worthwhile to consider
this assertion. It has been recently
shown (though, I imagine, not prov-
en) that violations of law correlate
positively not with the severity of
the penalities to be inflicted for such
violations, but with the incidence of
detection and apprehension. I don’t
believe that it is too far-fetched
to invoke these same conclusions for
honor violations, since many pre-
sumably stem from the same im-
pulses and motives.

It would seem, therefore, that each
step which maximizes the individ-
ual’s chances of being reported for
violations would tend to discourage
honor violations. But, today, it seems
that too many students are hesitant
to report violators, particularly fra-
ternity brothers and friends, because
of the severity of the penalty to be
inflicted on these violators. In the
three houses that I polled, nearly
two-thirds of the students indicated
that they would be more willing to
report violatiors if a modification of
the absolute penalty were to be
made. Since one-half of these same
respondents also indicated that they
were aware of violations and had
failed to report them, it would seem
that modification of the absolute
penalty would indeed discourage
honor violations. Thus it would ap-
pear that a less severe penalty would
serve more effectively as a deter-
rant.

Student Government Head
Discusses Phi Psi Action
To the Editor:

I would like to express my sur-
prise and concern over the recent
LF.C. Judicial Board decision con-
cerning the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.
Not only is the penalty inflicted
upon the fraternity wholly ineom-
mensurate with available evidence
of wrongdoing, but the manner in
which the matter was handled is
truly disconcerting.

I would hope that the LF.C. Judi-
cial Board or the Student Affairs
Committee take the initiative to re-
consider the matter, recommending
some lessening of the penalty. I
would also hope that the L F. C.
Judicial Board in the future observe
certain basic rights of fraternities in
considering violations of this nature.

Sincerely,

Lee! A few hardy souls are risk-
ing life and limb several afternoons
a week to learn about the
known affectionately as “Football for
Fun.” Rugby originated at Rugby
school in England about 1825, and
is one of the oldest and roughest
contact sports now played through-
out the world.

Rugby consists of two 40-minute
free-for-alls, with five minute inter-
mission to bind up wounds. The ball
resembles an over-blown  bootball
and is simply advanced toward the
opponents’ goal by carrying it. It
may also be passed laterally or

kicked ahead.

The ball is put in play by several
methods: a set scrum, a loose scrum,
and the line out. The set scrum in-
volves 8 members interlocking arms
and “heeling” or kicking the ball out
of the scrum when it is thrown be-
tween them. A loose scrum forms
whenever a ball-carrier is tackled
(when 6 or eight players are kick-
ing at the ball he is usually anxious

SecondIn Thwarting Rams

In a blaze of clutch hitting and superb pitching from Jim

W&L baseball squad doubled

its seasonal number of victories by sweeping a double header
from Richmond Profession Institute.

With overcast skies and rain threatening, the General hit-
ters came to life right away in the opening inning of the first
game. Captain Eric Sisler opened with a single through the
hole into left field. Dave Kirkpatrick followed with the same

putting Sisler on third. After Kirk was erased on the basepaths,
“®Tom Mitchell drove

in Sisler, stole
second and scored on Jack Anthony’s
sharp single to right.

With this two-run cushion, Coop-
er proceeded to put down the Rams,
with their only run coming on two
base hits with a stolen base sand-
wiched in between. Limiting RPI to
but five hits, Cooper gained his first
victory of the season, after being
denied victories when pitching solid
games but having little support. The
Generals added single runs in the
third and fourth innings to add in-
surance to the win, with rbi’s going
to John Wolf. Charlie Freret, re-
placing injured Ed Bishop at third,
collected two hits, and gave some
needed initiative to the W&L at-
tack.

The Generals came back deter-
mined to sweep the pair of games.
Coach Lyles selected Pete Heuman
to throw. Heuman, throwing very
hard in the cold weather and break-
ing his curve ball off extremely well,
baffled the Ram batters throughout.

Fresh with the first game under
their belts, the Generals started
quick again in the bottom of the

first loading the sacks with one out
but failed to score.

Lee Continues Discussion Of The Honor System

(Continued from page 2) there is no second chance accorded

the one who errs, no opportunity for
him to prove to his fellow students
that, given another chance, he can
prove himself a man of honor.

But what of the student body? Does
it gain anything by a student’s ex-
pulsion? Only the sanctimonious
few can benefit from the sense that
they have weeded out the weak and
maintained the integrity of the stu-
went body. But the community has
lost a great deal, because in the
student’s expulsion, it has abdi-
cated its greatest responsibility—the
responsibility to a fellow student. No
greater indictment could be served
on a community, and Washington
and Lee must wear heavily this
burden of guilt. Our responsibility
isn’t to punish for no perceivable
benefit, but to seek to rehabilitate the
few who err. But is this what we do?

pervade all systems of “justice,” but
I sincerely doubt if this principle can
be applied to our honor system. Is
there anyone here at Washington
and Lee who can honestly admit that
equal punishment should be accorded
the boy who steals one hundred
dollars and the boy, who in a mom-
ent of indiscretion, cheats on a test?
Does the boy who cheats habitually
deserve no greater punishment than
the boy who cheats for the first time
and is caught? And finally, is the
boy who readily admits his guilt be-
fore the Executive Committee, al-
though he realizes that he could
escape punishment simply by lying,
be punished when the habitual
but gifted violator, who knows that
only a confession will establish his
guilt, lies and goes unpunished? And
isn’t it perhaps a little ironical that
the student who presents fraudulent
identification in order to purchase

| have also wondered why the
absolute penalty has been considered
as the only plausible deterrent. Is
it not possible that other penalties
which are almost as severe, but
exist which are almost equally as se-
vere, but which permit the student
to return to Washington and Lee and
prove himself a man of honor? Would
not, for instance, a year’s suspension
serve equally as well, and yet per-
mit the individual to avoid the ir-
revocable stigma of expulsion.

Fraternity Placed On Probation

The fight was between the Phi Psi
house boy and a member of another
fraternity. The disturbance led the
plaintiff to call for the police con-
cerning which he remarked that the
complaint “was not only for this
instance but as a culmination of

Dishonorable Violator?
Under the present system, a per-
son is not merely convicted of a
single dishonest act, he is stigma-
tized as a dishonorable person. Sure-
ly, no one believes that a single act
of dishonesty makes a person, ipso
facto, a dishonorable man. But what

IFC Violations

Phi Kappa Psi was charged with
a violation of By-Law X, Section 4,
Paragraph B which states, “Girls
must be out of the house by 2 a.m.
on every night...,” and By-Law
X, Section 4, Paragraph H which
states that no undesirable conduct

misconduct which the fraternity had
already begun to do, and was placed
on Conduct Probation through
Openings Weekend of 1966. These
measures are designed entirely as a
warning, for as one member of the
IFC Judicial Board asserted, the
IFC has approached this case with
the hopes of handling it in such a
fashion as to prevent such a situation
from occurring again.

Draft Tests To
Begin Saturday

The first of three Selective Service
System examinations designed to
enable college students to continue
their 2-S draft deferments will be
given tomorrow at Washington and
Lee and at 1,200 other test centers
across the country.

The test, prepared and adminis-
tered under the supervision of Sci-
ence Research Associates in Chica-
go, will be given next Saturday,
May 21, and on Friday, June 3, in
addition to tomorrow. Students tak-
ing the test at Washington and Lee
should report to Reid Hall 203 by
8:30 a.m. Students assigned to VMI
are directed to Room 204, Old Sci-
ence Hall,

Each student must present both
cards which he received from SRA
in order to be admitted to the test.
Originally, fingerprinting was to be
mandatory in an attempt to keep
unauthorized persons from taking the
test, but earlier this week, Selective
Service decreed that any positive

form of identification will be ac-

cepted.

While a student's score on the ex-
amination will not alone determine
eligibility for a 2-S continuance, they
will be used by local boards along
with class standings and other cus-
tomary factors in determining eligi-
bility for a student deferment.

A score of seventy or better is
necessary, unless a students meets
his class-rank standards: for fresh-
men, top half of males in his class;
sophomores, top two-thirds; and
juniors, top three-quarters.

For current seniors who will be
attending graduate school in the fall,
the requirements are stricter: a score
of eighty, minimum, on the College
Qualification exam, or a rank within
the top one-quarter of his graduat-
ing class.

The examination itself will begin
at 9:00, and will be over about 1:00.
The test consists of 150 multiple-
choice questions and reportedly will
not favor any one subject area over
another.

 

Notice

University Proctor Bob Murray
said yesterday that the administra-
tion at VMI has decided to take
action against W&L students who
park haphazardly in the VMI park-
ing lot behind duPont Hall. Students’
cars, which recently have been park-
ed with no regard for white lines,
will be towed away by police. Mur-
ray hinted, however, that if students
show consideration and park away
from VMI buildings, leniency might
still be shown.

Chitwood (Library), Jody Kline (Student Control), and Steve Saunders

cording to Nurse Agnor.

New Intellectual Activity
Committee Taking Form

Dean Pusey announced yesterday
the appointment of four W&L facul-
ty members to serve on the student-
faculty committee to study means of
stimulating student intellecual activ-
ity at the University. They are Drs.
E. C. Griffith, Professor of Econom-
ies, Marshall Jarrett, Assistant Pro-
fessor of History, William J. Watt,
Professor of Chemistry, and George
W. Ray, Instructor in English.

Earlier this week, the Executive
Committee named President Bill
Jeffress, Kirk Follo, and Jim Awad
as three of the student body's rep-
resentatives on the committee, with
the fourth to be selected presently.

The joint committee wa sestablish-
ed by the Faculty Committee on
Courses and Degrees at its April26th
meeting, as a result of the E.C.’s
presentation of the Independent
Study proposal. At this time, the new
committee was charged with a con-
tinued study of the Independent pro-
gram and other such plans, and was
given freedom to “pursue any line
of enquiry it seems feasible.” The
committee has ben asked to report
its findings and recommendations to
the faculty through the Course-and-
Degrees Committee during the first
semester of next year.

The Independent Study Program,
fostered by Awad, calls for the short-
ening of the first semester to end

be devoted to extensive research by
each student in an area of his parti-

by his adviser, and to the preparation
of a paper of some length on that
topic. Such reports would be graded
only “honors,” “passing,” or “failure.”
Four reports with grade of “passing”

requisite to graduation.

Hotel in Washington, D.C.

Cecil Brown, news analyst and
commentator for KCET television
in Hollywood California, is the re-
cipient of the award to an individual
for news, commentary, and public
affairs. Mr. Brown's citation is for
his “thoughtful, forthright opinions

observation of, and involvement in,
the major events of our time.” With
this citation he also received a cash
award of $1000,

WCCO of Minneapolis will receive
the radio station award for its “sup-
port of cultural activity and civic
progress.” Cited are “the dedication
of its resources, skills, and air time
to the protection of human life and
property” during tornadoes, blizzards
and floods that struck its listening

On motion by Bryant Kendrick,
Saunders and the Assimilation Com-
mittee will work with Atwood to
improve and co-ordinate September
orientation at W&L itself, specifically
referring to the series of speeches
presented in Lee Chapel with com-
pulsory freshman attendance. Addi-
tionally, each of the four standing
committees will vist the dorms dur-
ing September, on a schedule to
be determined by the Assimilation
Committee.

Except for possible repercussions
in the faculty, the Phi Psi matter
seems to be settled. On Wednesday,
Phi Kappa Psi fraternity appealed
its $100 fine and conduct probation
penalties to the LF.C. Judicial Board,
with the result that the Board re-
voked the fine, but sustained the
conduct probation.

Yesterday afternoon, the Student
Affairs Committee supported the
Judicial Board’s decisions in a close
vote speaking for the Committee
Dean Atwood stated: “After review-

The Dance Board has named its
officers for the 1966-67 year. Tommy
Cox, Phi Kap from Richmond, will
serve as President; Paul Brower,

tinsville, Virginia, Secretary-Treas-
urer; Carlise Chambers, KA from
Atlanta, Publicity Chairman; and
Jim Oram, Delt from Byrn Mawr,
Pennsylvania, Chairman of the Floor
Committee.

The new Dance Board plans to
begin its work next year at Fresh-
man Camp, where it will take a poll
of freshmen entertainment prefer-
ences. A proposal is being discussed
to cut the Board's Advisory com-
mittee to fifteen members selected
from the student body at large rather
than the present system of two rep-
resentatives from each house.

Consideration is also being given
to raising the cost of dance plans
to $35 from its present $30.

will be
handled, under a motion proposed by
Fran Lawrence through a “personal”
approach; that is, an informal visit
by the Committee to the wayward
student in his room. Richard Nash
further proposed that students may
be requested to meet with the As-
similation Committee after repeated
violations, but that no means of forc-
ing such a meeting will be used.

Judicial Board Votes To
Revoke Phi Kappa Psi Fine

ing the information developed dur-
ing the hearings and seeing the
thoroughness of the investigation, I
feel that the Student Affairs Com-
mittee felt that the procedures of
the Judicial Board were thorough
and correct.”

The result is that the Phi Kappa
Psi Fraternity will go through Rush
Week and Openings next year under
conduct probation, a formal and
severe warning carrying serious im-
plications should gurther charges be
brought against Phi Psi.

Since it is in force during rush
week, the conduct probation penalty
has become much more potent than
it normally is. It is believed that
other fraternities will use the Phi
Psis’ perdicament against them in
competing for freshmen. In regard
to this problem LF.C. President Ren
Manning has warned that mention of
Phi Psis’ penalty during rush week
will constitute “dirty rush,” and will
be dealt with more severely than
usual.

Specifically, the Phi Psis had been
charged with long-continued dis-
turbances in their neighborhood and
the use of obscenities by Phi Phis
outside of the fraternity house. Dur-
ing the original hearing and the
appeal hearing, charges of threat-
ening a professor, keeping a girl in
the house after hours, and abetting
a fight in the Phi Psi parking lot
were thrown out.

 

ffens Cold Check

‘Rules; Changes Orientation

Committee whenever requested: an
E.C. member may accompany an
Assimilation Committee representa-
tive to speak to violators, but he
may not do so in an official capacity.
Each of these proposed motions
passed decisively, and are to serve
as a basis within which the Assimi-
lation Committee will work au-
tnymously.

On proposal made by Nash and
acceptd unanimously by the E.C.,
intentional cold checks will hence-
forth be considered honor violations
by the E.C. An “intentional” cold
check was unofficially defined as
being one written by a student on
insufficient funds, when he knows
that he does not have those funds,
and does not either post-date the
check or inform the person to whom
it is written that he does not have
funds.

The EC. pointed out that, as
is customary in consideration of pos-
sible honor violations, a conviction
for passing an intentional cold check
would come only after “full, complete
and unassailable” proof of knowledge
and intention had been demonstrated.

To effect the ruling, the Cold
Check Committee will be advised to
turn over directly to the E.C. cases
in which it suspects intentional
coldness; the E.C. will investigate
thoroughly in its usual manner.

(A complete explanation of the
ruling and the extent of its applica-
tion will be prepared by E.C. Nash
for publication in the Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi.)

A strengthening of unintentional
cold-check violations was also pass-
ed last night. Under the new regula-
tions proposed by the Kendrick, a
$1 fine will be given for the first
cold-check offence; on the second, a
fine up to $25 and a letter to be
written to the violator’s parents; on
the third, warning by the Execu-
tive Committee; and on subsequent
violations, the E.C. will consider
recommending to Dean Atwood the
expulsion or suspension from the
University of the offender, depend-
ing on each case’s particular cireum-
stances. As in the past, cold checks
will be kept on record for two years

Lewis Indicates Weak Student Body
As Reason For University’s Problems

The Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Friday Edition—May 13, 1966

 

No Integration Now

In light of the Executive Committee’s Monday resolution
to make “all possible efforts toward facilitating the assimilation
of any Negro student into the student body’’ and Fred Mindel’s
generous gesture in giving all of his Gilliam Award money to
further integration at W&L, we note with regret that there will
not be a Negro student here next year. The Admissions office

received no applications from Negro students this spring.

It is not particularly strange that no Negro would apply
to come to W&L. Despite our high academic reputation, there
is no indication that a Negro freshman could be happy in the

I propose a Copernican Revolution
in attempting to expose the deficien-
cies of Washington and Lee. Prior
contributors to the Ring-tum Phi
have been quick to criticize the ad-
ministration and faculty. I, however,
will insist that the primary problems
at Washington and Lee are derived

body. The student body is homogene-
ous. Students are predominantly from
middle and upper middle class back-
grounds. They are white, Christian,
and Southern. I am not asking the
admissions office to turn W&L into
a sequester for the New Left, or a
haven for minority groups, or a
Southern Berkeley. I do, however,
suggest that a broader student body
be actively sought. A student body
which offers divergent backgrounds
and different outlooks is the begin-
ning of an academic community. If
students disagree—if their own ideas

ization of the student community
into small living groups which are
too homogeneous. Further, it shifts
the emphasis from the University to
the fraternity—from academics to
social life. No matter what actions
are taken students will select their
own friends. Moreover, students do
need a social outlet. But I suggest
that the University could be better
served by campus housing for up-
perclassmen. The types of social
dormitories, which have been so suc-
cessful and popular elsewhere, would
provide badly needed opportunities

interdisciplinary courses have be-
come popular at other academic in-
stitutions and are not found only
in the Ivy League.

Specificially, and without much
elaboration I offer the following pro-
gram which is used at another uni-
versity in place of the current Eng-
lish-history requirements employed
at W&L. The Greek tradition (It’s
disastrious that even a humanity
major can graduate from Washington
and Lee with no concept of the
Greek civilization), the European
tradition, the nature of literature,

social atmosphere that persists at W&L. The social domina-

are continually questioned—then one

for intellectual and social inter-

and philosophy (classic and contem-
porary). The first two courses would
emphasize the history and literature
of the particular period. The third
course would be an examination of
different forms of literature with
reading from representative authors
rather than sticking to English au-
thors. The fourth course is self-ex-
planatory.

Twentieth-Century Problems

Further, I recommend that stu-
dents be given a choice of courses
which would emphasize the problems
of the twentieth century. These
courses might include a course on
the twentieth century phenomenon
of revolution, war, and totalitarian-
ism for those who are politically in-
clined; or a course on the twentieth
century society consciousness and so-
ciety which might emphasize exis-
tentialism and psychoanalysis.
Obviously, I have not elaborated
these interdisciplinary studies or my
other suggestions in enough detail
to reach any final conclusions. I am
merely asking that the University
look around and see what new is be-
ing done in the field of education
and to carefully consider if Washing-
ton and Lee can be improved and
to determine if any of the programs
of other universities might aid in
the transformation of Washington
and Lee from one giant fraternity
into a genuine academic community.

would expect perpetual self-exam-
ination and a deeper probing of
ideas which are presented in the
classroom,
The Fraternity System

2. A critical re-examination of the
fraternity system. I believe the fra-
ternity system causes the decentral-

more than a “gentleman” C.
But hard study and a desire for
good grades, in my opinion, are not
enough. Most students treat the
grade as an end in itself or as an
option for graduate school. The gen-
eral attitude is that “if it’s in the
text book, I’ll learn it ‘cold’ for the
next hour quiz.” Apparently, there is
little true interest in ideas, little
extension of discussion into after
classroom hours; in short, a genuine
academic atmosphere is lacking.
Having attended another universi-
ty last semester, I think that I can
point out aspects of Washington and
Lee which are indicative of this at-
titude.

Where Students are Lacking
1. A mediocre college newspaper.
Other college newspapers have ar-
ticles concerning the research of
students and professors, book re-
views, comprehensive examinations
of the conflicts in modern society,
etc.
2. A dearth of genuine ideas and
criticism in class. Students are in-
clined to accept the status quo, that
is: the text and the professor. Sel-
dom does a student stand up and
question the validity of the text or
the professor's assertions. The profes-
sor’s lecture is spit back verbatim
on the hour test. Secondly, there
is no attempt to extend the text
book—to look for further implica-
tions of what has been said.

3. In addition to “2,” classroom dis-
cussions are fiascos. In those discus-
sion courses which I have taken, the

course. Space prohibits further elab-
oration of this idea.

3. A revision of the required
courses. I suggest a de-department-
alized training in the required hu-
manity courses which would empha-
size totality rather than the couse re-
stricted to English or history. These

tion of fraternities with their written and implicit discriminatory
clauses and their one-ball systems, the unabashed prejudices
of many students, the all-white student body, and the lack of
social life outside of the W&L community would militate
against the happiness of any Negro adventuresome enough to
come here.

Nevertheless, there are ways to make W&L more palatable
to the interested Negro high school student. The best way
would be for W&L students themselves to voluntarily show
their good will and willingness to accept Negro students into
the W&L community. The E.C.’s resolution, while more spir-
itual than concrete, is a step in this direction.

A better idea is that of Fred Mindel and his associates, en-
tailing raising funds from students to award scholarships to
financially needy Negroes wishing to come here and to extend
an information and recruitment service to Negro high schools.

We see no sense in “buying a school Negro,” but neither do
Mindel’s integration committee and the E.C. However, we do
emphatically wish to let potentially interested and qualified
Negro high school students know that they are welcome here,
and that there are many students who will sincerely try to assim-
ilate them into the W&L community.

 

 

 

Enough For Obituaries

As everyone expected, the faculty stuck to their guns on
the Southern Collegian issue and refused to reverse their Feb-
ruary decision to withdraw university funds from the magazine.
Had they reversed the decision, it would have resulted in an
intolerable loss of face in the perpetual standoff of Hill versus

and “All Together Now,” by Bud Goodheart, are pact of the

students.

Nevertheless, we regret that they did not at least give the
Collegian an adequate chance to reform itself. While past edi-
tions of the magazine have been generally objectionable to
older readers and to a few students, the last edition confirms
Drew Baur’s promise to redesign the Collegian as a satire mag-
azine. This last edition, while not literarily inspired throughout
and rather unfair in its satire, was enjoyable, relatively clean,

and showed considerable effort and good faith on the part of its

editor and staff.

But enough for obituaries. We hope that next year will see
a rebirth of a student-financed Southern Collegian as a satirical

and humorous magazine of student expression.

 

Welcome Alumni

The Ring-tum Phi welcomes back the classes of '16,'26, °41
‘51, °56, and ’61. Washington and Lee has changed in many
respects since each of the Reunion Classes graduated; we be-
lieve that these changes have, in general, helped bring the
University to a higher degree of greatness in its primary en-
deavor, education. In joining students, faculty, and administra-
tion to welcome you, we trust that you will like, as we do,

what we are becoming in the field of education.

A Liberal Arts Education Should Lead

By CHAPLAIN W. MORRISON

In the year and a half which has
gone by since I discussed the prob-
lem of grading in
a letter to the
Ring-tum Phi, my
opinions have un-
dergone a radical
change and I have
been asked to
state my new posi-
tion. Since it is
quite simple to
state—I think that
the coercive as-
peets of the grad-
ing aystem inhib-
it rather than foster genuine learn-
ing and that the present grading
system should therefore be abol-
ished—I would like instead to discuss
the larger preblem of education at
Washington and Lee in Rick Mar-
golies’ fine letter in this paper's last
issue. If an objection is made against
the letter that it seema overly hos-
tile to the school, 1 would answer
that I think there is a considerable
smount of hostility among the stu-
dents against the school—much more
than the administration and faculty
to be aware of-—and that |

a course is offered full advantage is
rarely taken of it.

two “browns” who always want to
talk to the professor after class. Why
is this not more prevalent? At the
University I attended last semester,
the professors were swarmed after
every class.
5. A total absence of academic in-
terests outside the clasroom. Every
once and a while, students—among
themselves—examine ideas presented
in the classroom. But this is not
common practice. I would expect
that students to some degree would
express an interest—outside the
classroom—in their academic work.
What To Do About It
I could list many more examples,
but I hope my point is clear. I seek
what is generally known as an aca-
demic community. That W&L falls
short of this goal is painfully ob-
vious; recognition of the problem
is only the first, short step to its
solution. 1 tentatively suggest the
following courses of action.
1. Diversification of the student

By STEVE MILLARD

May 12, 1991
Dear Joe,
Sorry to hear about your last-
minute meeting—we'd expected you
in Lexington last weekend. Family
plans call for a trip in your direc-
tion next month, so, I'll look forward
to seeing you then; in the meantime,
thought I'd send you some up-to-
the-minute impressions of our mu-
tual alma mother.
Numerically, the reunion was a
success. The class of 66 either liked
hell out of the place or felt in uni-
versal need of a trip to the sticks.
As might be expected, the wallets
and paunches were equally immense;
but, of course, that class also pro-
duced its share of real celebrities.
Frazier the Governer, Rider the au-
thor, Marchese the 15-cent pizza-
burger king—they all showed, as did
several others of some renown.

Still the main attraction was
the school itself, And, if the class
as a whole shared one impression,
it had to be a sense of continuity—

ience remarkably like our own,
even in some quite specific re-
spects. Some of our classmates
make it back every year, while
some are in my position and sel-
dom get the chance—but all seem
to agree that W&L holds fast to
its particular mode of existence.

I'll save a play-by-play account
of the weekend for next month.
Right now my mood would prob-
ably be better expressed in more
generalized terms. The length of
time between my trips back seems to
give me an unusual perspective
when I do return; since you make
it back fairly often, you might find
a different viewpoint interesting.
Specifically, you're probably wond-
ering how I ean find much “eonti-
nuity” in things after my long
absence, in view of some pretty
striking changes. Let's look at it
from that angle.

When we graduated, the movement
to bring a Negro to campus was
just getting off the ground. Now, of
course, there are about twenty; a
few even belong to fraternities.
Change? In a way, nothing less
than a revolution.

But in another sense, it's not
quite the fundamental alteration it
appears to be. In the first place,
W&L was a belated follower in
the national change of values
which led to their admission. More
important—have you taken a good
look at the school’s Negro repre-
sentatives? In every respect ex-
cept skin color, those boys are
very much like a million other
WAL graduates, Economically, so-
cially, mentally—they fit perfectly
into the University's style of life,
The real change was the under-
lying value adjustment which per-
mitted them to be accepted on that
basis—a phenomenon far greater
Than Washington and Lee or any
other single school. The point is
not to criticize the University; I'm
just establishing a basis for my
feeling that continuity does exist.
Te cite another example: several
of the buildings on and around
campus were just a gleam in some-
body's eye when we left the place.
The Student Union, the new gym,
the theater—-remember what the old
ones looked like?’Surely, that must

were. The athletic department still
operates for the benefit of guys who
came to school as students and hap-
pen to enjoy sports as a sideline. The
theater prepares a few people for
graduate work in drama; yet basic-
ally it still belongs to the student
looking for an extra dimension of
college life. The new Student Union
apparently strengthened the NFU
without damaging the fraternities.
These new houses simply represent
new variations on fine and familiar
themes.

The final touch was my brief
trip into the academic world.
There's no quicker way to have
“continuity” seared upon your
mind than to run into some of your
old professors. They're twenty
years grayer, but apparently it's
the same old story: the good ones

In a particular way, Washington and
Lee is timeless. There are positive
and negative connotations in that
idea, both of which are quite inten-
tional. The school is always one step
slower to change than its academic
neighbors. Whatever specific moves
are made, they take place in leisure-
ly response to much more sweeping
changes. Yet this same environment

Bensinger Delivers Last Blast
Collegian, Cartoons, Keane, Panic

By CHARLIE BENSINGER

Dear Mom and Dad,

Well, its been an interesting year,
the year of Big Brother. I have
learned many things in this wonder-
ful year. Indeed, I have learned that
one had better be
careful of how he
dresses if he wants
to see the inside of
his fraternity
house again.

I have learned
that the Southern
Collegian is trash
| from those who
| allocate my mon-
ey for me.

I have learned
that some people
are touchy about being referred to
in print and that others have a sense
of humor instead.

I have learned that cartoons had
better be just cartoons, not French
postcards.

I have learned that in four years
here one can hardly escape the
claws of the Great Molder, He Who
Makes All Alike.

I have learned that there should
be a course in catalogue compre-
hension so that the poor student can
see why he is to be castigated when
he sees on his obit the lines “as
found in the catalogue on page 69,”

I have learned that not all pro-
fessors use the same scale to eval-
uate students and that not all pro-
fessors use the same scale to evalu-
ate each student .

And I have learned that it’s not
always what you say but how you
say it and about whom you are
saying it that gets you in trouble.

But now as 4 a.m. passes I have
run out of resentments and have to
fill this space in other ways.

Other Ways

Poor Johnny Keane—the jockey
whose horse has just died. It isn’t
his fault that the Yanks are fighting
Kansas City and the other tail-
enders. It is simply that where the
Yankees once had strong young men,
they now have somebody's father.

Ralph Houk may pull them up
near the first division, but until
their farm system begins to produce
like others in the league they won't
be in the big show in September.

Just one note on basketball please.
In the NBA draft held a couple of
days ago there were three players
from Ohio Valley Conference select-
ed in the first three rounds. This is
the same conference that is Western
Kentucky's stomping ground.

They're for real, and only the ref-
erees saved Michigan in the NCAA
last year. Western loses only one of
its starters too, and his is the num-
ber five scorer. One day someone
is going to notice that it’s publicity
that makes some conferences what
they are.

 

Bensinger

Speaking. of basketball, there’s
more good news for those who watch
the local variety. It seems that
Coach Canfield has landed a 6’ 5”
boy who in the opinion of a member
of this year’s squad is better than
All-State Mel Cartwright, who also
will be here next year.

On top of this, about two inches
worth, there will be a 6’ 7” freshman
next year. He has promise it is
said. My God a W&L line-up aver-
aging over 3’ 9”—I think we might
be going somewhere.

Still Other Ways

58 Athletes Participate
In CAC Tourney Today

At present, Washington leads
the CAC with 65 points, followed
by Sewanee with 55, W&L with
4214, Centre with 37'!4, and
Southwestern of Memphis with 25.

The Generals will be relying
on their golf and tennis teams for
a major share of the point-getting,
while the track and _ baseball
teams probably will get a stern
test from Washington.

Washington and Lee's golfers
will carry a 4-3 record and a
recent fourth-place state tourna-
ment finish into the CAC. The
team will be led by senior Ed
Crosland, and freshman Bab Mat-
thews.

Crosland, who finished second
in the CAC a year ago at Se-
wanee, has been playing steady
golf this season, shooting con-
sistently in the low 70's. Matthews
also has been a low-70 perform-

er.

In baseball, the Generals are
fresh from a double-header win
ever RPI Monday, and carry a
3-5 reeord to St. Louis. Both hit-
ting and pitching have picked up
after a slow start, which could
mean a repeat of a second place
or better. The Generals have lost
to Washington in the finals two
times.

The track team seems the least
promising due to a shortage of
sprinters. Defending
Ric Mynntinen in the javelin,
Earl Edwards in the discus and
shot put, Lee Johnson in the dis-
tance runs, John Lawrence and
John Graham in the pole vault,
and Jim Thompson in the 880
should be contenders in their
specialties.

Carnival To Return To Lexington;
Sorry Fans, Darlene Can’t Make It

By OAK SEIBERT

Once again Lexington has been
the scene of a memorable moment in
sports. In a recent kickball game at
the local grade school the fans were
thrilled by a spectacular triple play
executed by the shortstop. He caught
the ball for one out, and then pro-
ceeded to tag out the runner going
to second base and then the runner
returning to second. The player in
question was not available for com-
ment after the game since recess
ended the hard-fought contest, but
it is believed he is being scouted by
Lexington High School.

Unfortunately for the local in-
stitution, the word around the
Southern Kickball Coach’s Associa-
tion Convention has it the local
athlete is headed for B. V. High.
Conjecture has it that he has been

 

offered something called an athletic
grant-in-aid. This term is obviously
being used as a cover-up, since no-
where in the entensive facilities of
Macmac Library is such a term de-
fined. It is too bad that the local in-
stitution is going to lose the boy,
since he could have done a great deal
to improve the team and help revive
interest in the sport and improve
school spirit on the part of the stu-
dents and alumni.

Incidentally, there really has been
a group of students watching the
kickball games recently. Who says
there isn’t anything to do in Lex-
ington,

For all you sport’s fans who have
nothing to do this weekend, the Fair

Rueger-less Racketmen
Lose To R-M; Defeat H-S

By JERRY PERLMAN

Washington and Lee’s free- swing-
ing netters, minus the services of
number one singles player Tommy
Rueger, managed to split a pair of
away matches this week. Rueger,
who re-injured his right wrist last
week against Old Dominion, was left
at home as Coach Canfield’s boys
traveled to Hampden-Sydney on
Monday and Randolph-Macon on
Tuesday.

In Monday’s match, Rueger’s ab-
sence was not substantially felt, as
the Generals swept the first four
singles matches and all three of the
doubles for an easy 7-2 triumph.
Team captain Forrest Dickinson,
playing for the first time in the num-
ber one slot, breezed to a 6-2; 6-0
victory. This was followed by Phil
Thompson's 6-3; 6-2 victory at num-

” ber two, Ray Turman’s 6-1; 6-2 win
*

at number three, and Wick Velline’s
8-6; 8-6 triumph at number four.
W&L's loss came at the number five
singles spot, where Charlie Lee drop-
ped a 6-4; 6-4 decision. This was
followed by Steve Greenia’s 6-4;
7-5 defeat at number six.

The doubles were then swept by
W&L, with Dickinson and Thompson
taking number one 7-5; 6-1, Steve
Case and Fred Taussig coming from
behind for a 6-8; 6-1; 6-4 victory
at number two, and Turman moving
from his usual number one doubles
slot, teaming with Lee for a 6-4;
6-2 win.

On Tuesday, though, Rueger’s
services were sorely missed as the
Generals suffered their second loss
of the season, at the hands of the
Yellow Jackets of Randolph-Macon
by a 5-4 margin. Canfield, trying
to make up for Rueger’s absence,
juggled his line-up and sent his
number six singles player, Lee to
face the number one Yellow Jacket.
Lee, playing far out of his league,
dropped a 6-0; 6-0 decision. Then
Canfield’s strategy began to pay off,
as Dickinson breezed to a 6-0; 6-2

 

The Bell System has many small, eutomatic

telephone offices around the
country. The equipment in them
could operate unattended for
ten years or so, but for a problem.

The many electric motors in those offices
needed lubrication at least once a year. Heat
from the motors dried up the bearing oils,
thus entailing costly annual maintenance,

To stamp out this problem, many tests

were conducted at Bell Telephone
Laboratories. Lubricant engi-
neer George H. Kitchen decided

to do a basic experiment that

Lacrosse Loses

The varsity lacrosse team battled
the Virginia Cavaliers valiantly in
their final game of the season Wed-
nesday but emerged on the short
side of 6-2 decision.

Coach Swan felt the team gave
the visitors a good fight, but it was
not one of the stickmen’s better ef-
forts. Virginia scored two goals in
both the second and third periods to
gain a 5-2 advantage with the final
quarter remaining. Tom Pittman,
who assisted Jay Bowersox on the
first General tally, netted the final
General score of the season in the
third period, but the offense was
unable to score in the final quarter.

This was the final game of long
and illustrious athletic careers for
co-captain Billy Andrews, Bruce
Jackson, and Jay Bowersox. Each
climaxed a fine season, as high scor-
ing Jackson paced the offense
throughout the year. Andrews was
the defensive standout on the mid-
field, shutting out his man in the
final three contests. Bowersox finish-
ed close behind Jackson in scoring.
All kept the team spirit up and
constantly helped the younger and
inexperienced players.

At the team party following the
game, Coaches Swan and Van Rens-
selaer ware presented with tokens
of the team’s appreciation for their
patience and understanding during
the season. Lance Bendann was re-
elected captain for the ’67 season.

of a liberal arts college like Wash-

the world and their place in that
world. The practical skills necessary
to operate in our modern society
should be a by-product rather than
a goal of a liberal arts education.
An education oriented toward such
skills has three obvious defects: (1)
many of them become obsolete very
quickly in our society; (2) most
professors are not the people best
equipped to teach such skills; (3)
many of the skills are totally use-

needed wins in all three doubles to

short, as Drew Baur, taking the

Traditions—Stagnation
(Continued from page 2)

al version of the educational process
I pretty well missed the boat when
I was there, and have since wond-
ered if the school itself really rec-
ognizes its own possibilities. Univer-
sity leaders insist upon emphasiz-
ing the treasured “traditions,” which
are really beside the point; they
might be better advised to examine
the inherent possibilities of size and
environment, which are the point.
Anything which enhances the stu-
dent-professor and student-student
relationships is a natural step for
that school: more seminars, changes
in the grading system, further inde-
pendent work, and the like. “Time-
lessness” can convey a sense of stag-
nation—or, perhaps, a bit of the eter-
nal. For the time being, W&L con-
tinues in its own curious middle-
ground.

Well, I've rambled—but it was that
kind of weekend. Give your family
the Traditional Friendly Greeting,

a lot more to talk about.

totally disappointed in the perform-
ance of players. Captain Dickinson,
he said, “played the best tennis of
his entire life. The team that he
and Thompson defeated had been
undefeated in fourteen previous
matches.”

The Generals now take their 7-2
record to St. Louis for the CAC
championships this weekend, and
their hopes in the tournament hinge
on whether or not a week’s layoff
has given Rueger’s wrist a chance
to improve. A sound Rueger at
number one could result in a W&L
victory but without him, the Gen-
erals have to be considered definite
underdogs. Canfield was quoted as
saying that he expected Washington
U. and Sewanee to be the teams to
beat in the tourney, with the team
from St. Louis having the home
court advantage and the seasoning
provided b ya 21-match schedule, as
the definite favor.

In other recent tennis action,
W&L’'s freshman team finished its
season with a 3-2 record, registering
an easy 9-0 win over Fishburn
Military School. In a match in which
none of the freshmen were pressed
for a win, the only highlight was
the appearance on the court of Son-
ny Nunbhadoi, the son of the Vice
Chief of Staff of the Army of the
Republic of Thailand. Playing in
the number two slot for Fishburn, he
dropped a 6-0; 6-2 decision to Don
McClure.

in determining numbers of offences.
I| The letter-home and possible-sus-
pension rules were added to the
Cold Check Committee’s regulations
after the defeat of an earlier pro-
posal that legal action be instigated
in cases of constant offenders. This
latter system was felt to place an
undue burden on merchants in their
attempts to receive payment on cold
checks.
Also accepted by the E.C, was a
motion from Lawrence that negilgent
accounts with merchants in town be
placed under the jurisdiction of the
Cold Check Committee, with an
amendment that specific means of
enforcement be left to the discretion
of the C.C. Committee, with E.C.
approval.

On motion from Nash, it was de-

and intends to make all efforts

toward facilitating the assimilation
of any Negro students into the
student body.

In other business, the E.C. re-
appointed Steve Saunders by ac-
clamation as Chairman of the Interim
Co-Ordinating Committee of the 1968
Mock Republican Convention,

At earlier meetings during the
week, the new EC. selected mem-
bers to the four standing commit-
tees:

Student Control: Jody Luck, Pi

chairman; Al Byrne, SAE from

E.C., and at that time to present a
typewritten report on committee ac-
tions in the preceeding weeks. Mem-
bers of the standing committee will
be invited to bring suggestions or
problems to the attention of the E.C.
directly.

Attention was turned to the reso-
lution concerning the encouragement
of Negro applications to W&L which
was passed Monday by the outgoing
E.C. Discussion involved apparent
misinterpretations of the resolution
which appeared in various Virginia
newspapers ths week, notably in the
Times - Dispatch.

Discussion ensued as to the ob-
ligations of the E.C. to represent
constituent opinion, and as to the
propriety of the student govern-
ment’s encouragement of Negro ap-
plications. The Times-Dispatch was
in apparent error, Faulk said, in
stating that the resolution encourages
“recruitment” of “at least one” Ne-
gro; the intent of the resolution is
merely to back up responsible efforts
by students in encouraging such ap-
plicants.

The resolution was subsequently
passed, 5-3, as follows:

that Darlene, one of the real crowd

better things in show business. Her

sure some of the new entertainers
will rise to the occasion and come up
with something new.

center instead of on the circum-

be an ordinary proscenium stage
where simple drama might be
staged, but surrounding the audi-

fifteen feet wide. To allow the
audience to follow the action as it
moves around them by scenes, seats
would rotate 360 degrees. The cur-
tain, Kahn explains, would be
made in sections, so that all or
any part of the stage could be
bared at any one time. This, Kahn
says, would “allow us to do any
type of theatre we want to.” The
circular nature of the stage with
the audience surrounded by the
action would tend to bring them
into participation in the play and

Winners of the award for creative

Since the University will not sup-
ply funds for the building of a new
theatre, which it seems to feel (un-
fortunately fo rthe performing arts
at W&L) is not worthy of strong
consideration at present, Mr. Kahn
has had to go to outside sources.
He took a recent trip to New Or-
leans where he talked with Mr.
Monroe Lippman, the head of thea-
tre at Tulane, about approaching
cerrtain foundations for the funds
with which to build such an addi-
tion to our physical plant. The
problem, though no real problem at

all in Mr. Kahn’s eyes, is that these
foundations would build a theatre
only if it were to be new and ex-
perimental; they would not build

“theatre-in-the-doughnut”

Kahn Wants New Theatre

only actors and stagehands, but
the audience itself.

Though the whole affair is only
in the visionary stages, Kahn has
been thinking about where the new
theatre would be built. He is un-
able to give a definite idea yet,
but in connection with his plan to
bring the theatre more into W&L
life, he wants it nearer the campus.
One of the things which keeps
students away from Troub presen-
tations is that the theatre is poorly
located. Another, more important,
lack is that of comfort and attract-
iveness. The new theatre would
solve these problems and more,
making the whole atmosphere one
of real enjoyment, rather than mere
visual entertainment.

Kahn's ideas in the realm of ex-
perimentation are not only re-

Mr. — stricted to the theatre building it-
Hendrickson has made suggestions

to Khan and has produced many
interesting ideas for the proposed
theatre. One of these suggestions,
which seems to be Kahn’s favorite,
it what Kahn calls “a theatre-in-

self; he is interested in experi-
mental dramatic literature. In the
next season, if possible, and if not,
then in the near future, he would
like to present Peter Weiss’ new
Marat/Sade play, an offshoot of
the Theatre of the Absurd and of
the Theatre of Cruelty; Becket by

Jean Anouilh, which will be the
Troub’s first play next season and
which, as Mr. Kahn describes it, is
“a beautiful show”; and some
Brecht, perhaps Galileo or The
Chalk Circle.

Lee Kahn will find no rest dur-
ing the summer. He is directing the
first play in the Rockbridge Play-
ers’ summer series, Gibson’s Two
For the See-Saw, from June 13th
through June 18th. He then moves
north to Williamsport, Pennsyl-
vania, where he is guest-directing
that city’s last summer-stock play
of the season. He is planning to do
a period farce, but is not yet
sure which one. Beggars’. Opera
looms as a possibility.

From the enthusiasm that Mr.
Kahn has raised this year, it ap-
pears that the Troubs are in for
“better-than-ever” seasons next
year and in those to come.

Don Huffman, a senior in the
Washington and Lee Law School, has
been elected Chairman of the Rock-
bridge County Republican Party.
Huffman succeeds Dr. Charles Phil-
lips, who is Associate Professor of
Economics at Washington and Lee.
Huffman is ending his senior year
at the Law School and besides at-
tending school operates The College
Town Shop. He is a member of ODK
and was recently selected for Phi
Beta Kappa.

The W&L student was unanimous-
ly elected at the Rockbridge Re-
publican Mass Meeting which was
held last Thursday in the Court-
house. This meeting also chose Pro-
fessor Robert Huntley of the Law
School to be the Executive Commit-
teeman to the Rockbridge Party from
Buena Vista.

Dr. Charles V. Laughlin, also of
the Law School, was chosen to head

the Rockbridge delegation to the
Seventh District Convention which
will be held in Charlottesville on

June 18. Don Huffman will lead the
Rickbridge Republicans to the Vir-
tinia Republican Convention at the
Roanoke Hotel on July 2.

The Mass Meeting was well at-
tended, not only by the citizens
of Rockbridge, but there was also a
group of W&L students.

Tom Cox, President of the Dance
Board, announced yesterday that
The Impressions will be featured at
the Finals Concert on May 31st in-
stead of Little Anthony and The
Imperials who broke their engage-
ment last week. The Impressions will
be backed up by the Fabulous Five.
The concert, to be held on Tuesday
night in the Doremus Gynasium,
will end at approximately 10 p.m.
and will be followed immediately by
a combo party at the Pavilion un-
der the sponsorship of the Dance
Board. Ed Allen, social chairman of
the LF.C. and next year’s Fancy
Dress President, said the Orlons,
backed by the Monzas, will be the
scheduled entertainment.

The Impressions

The Impressions are a well-travel-
ed group who hits include: “Gypsy
Woman,” “It’s Alright,’ “Keep
on Pushing,” and “You Must Believe
Me” as well as “I’m so Proud” and
“Amen.” Tickets for the concert
will be placed on sale soon at the
Co-op.

A change of Faculty Advisors to
Dance Board has been necessitated
by the departure of both Dean John
and Coach Norris Eastman, who
have served in this capacity for sev-
eral years. Both of the men will be
seeking further education. Chosen
to replace the two are Drs. Hughes
and Phillips of the Commerce School.

Democrats Set
1966 Elections
This Thursday

The W&L Young Democrats will
conclude their year’s activities with
an elections of officers Thursday at
> p.m. in Payne 6. A president, five
vice presidents, a secretary and a
treasurer are to be elected to head
the 100-member club for next year.

During the past several weeks
W&L Law Young Democrats under
the leadership of president Joe Tate
and with the assistance of the under-
graduate club have been working at
the Rockbridge County Courthouse
compiling a card file of registered
and un-registered voters. The pool
books and city directory are being
used in this effort.

The clubs will use this file to con-
duct a non-partisan registration
drive, backed by various civic or-
ganizations. The Young Democrats
have approached the electoral board
about the possibility of appointing
deputy registrars as has been done
in Charlottesville. However the law
does not authorize this procedure
where registration is done in each
precinct as in Lexington. During the
last part of May and the first part
of June, the law group will con-
centrate on contacting un-registered
voters and urging them to register
before the June 11 deadline

Permission has been secured from
the city manager's office to post
notices on utility polls indicating the
location of Lexington’s registrars.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Tuesday Edition

 

Ex Uno Plura

For the past few years there has been increasing discussion
concerning the separation of the Law School from the student
government apparatus of the undergraduate school. In an edi-
toral which appeared in last year’s Ring-tum Phi it was pointed
out that only a very few members of the Law School student
body have bothered to have their pictures made for the Calyx.
Judging from this year’s turnout and several other recent
developments, we wish to urge that a serious and responsible
effort be made to affect a complete separation.

If the Law School expects to be pictured in the yearbook
it should be able to round up at least a majority of students
willing to have their pictures taken. The problem is that the
Law School does not want to be in the Calyx nor does it have
much of a desire for any connection at all with the undergradu-
ate school. Law students are not generally interested in the
Ring-tum Phi, Southern Collegian, or the Calyx primarily be-
cause there is so little space devoted to the Law School by these
publications.

Since the student body of the Law School is increasingly
made up of graduates of other colleges, the new Law School
has fewer interests in common with the college. Few law stu-
dents attend undergraduate activities; almost none concern
themselves with undergraduate problems. There are few if any
assimilations in the Law School, and the instances of honor
cases are exceedingly rare.

Representation of the Law School on the student body Exe-
cutive Committee was reduced last year after a constitutional
amendment passed the student body with a comfortable ma-
jority. There are still a few law students who serve on the
standing committees, but these men are almost always alumni
of W&L. In reality law students have almost no contact or
interest in the affairs of the student government or the student
publications.

There are obviously certain occasions such as the Mock
Convention, which cooperation between the Law School and
the college is beneficial. Their familiarity with legal procedure
makes the presence of law students on the Executive Com-
mittee particularly valuable. The same might be said for their
presence on the Student Control Committee.

Nevertheless certain mandatory ties between the Law
School and the college are unreasonable. Why should law stu-
dents have to pay for publications which do not serve their
interests? Why should they be required to support a student
government which hardly affects them and which in turn is not
concerned with their problems? These and other questions de-
serve careful consideration by both the Executive Committee
and the leaders of the Law School. We are certain that a poll
of the law student body would demonstrate their desire to serv-
er their connections with the undergraduate school.

We trust that the responsible leaders in both schools will
explore the possibility of a reorganization which would be in

the best interests of both the Law School and the college.

Washington and Lee students, for
the most part have remained amaz-
ingly detached from one of the most
significant social events in American
history, namely, the civil rights
movement. Not only are we largely
ignorant of many of the sources and
ramifications of this revolution, not
only have we failed to sufficiently
analyze what this means to Washing-
ton and Lee, but we have also failed
to respond to this through actions
which would be directly in the best
interests of this university and its
highest ideals and goals. It is crucial
that we, as students with a direct
interest and responsibility to Wash-
ington and Lee, clearly investigate
our position on racial integration, and
follow up our conclusions with re-
sponsible efforts that enhance, rather

By RICHARD NASH

Last Thursday night, the newly
elected Executive Committee met in
order to adopt general outlines con-
cerning policies for the new Assim-
ilation and Cold Check committees.
During this session I moved that the
Executive Committee consider any
intentional passing of a cold check
by a Washington and Lee student
an honor violation. The motion pass-
ed unanimously and will go into
effect next September.

This move is one which has been
necessitated by the increasing num-
ber of cold checks, both intentional
and non-intentional, that have been
passed in the last two years. The
cashing of a check with the
knowledge that there are insufficient
funds with which to cover it is a
crime punishable by law. But so
common a practice that it has reach-
ed a peak. Not only have many in-
dividual students engaged in the
practice, but many of them have
written ten or more.

This problem seems to stem from
one main source. It is, unfortunately,
the Cold Check Committee itself. Be-
cause of the committee’s existence
and operation, students feel that it

will not get into much trouble, if
at, and they feel free to cash cold
checks here in Lexington when
they would never dream of doing it
at home over the summer.

Because of W&L students taking
advantage of the Cold Check Com-
mittee, our relations with town mer-
chants has suffered considerably.
Most merchants are now hesitant
about cashing checks and some re-
fuse to continue it at all. A few mer-
chants now charge fines for all cold
checks. And others have gone so far

than hinder, the progress of this uni-
versity.

Washington and Lee, as any other
college or university, has a respon-
sibility to provide a service to so-
ciety and to the academic world.
This lies at the center of its justifi-
cation for existing. Yet exactly what
does this responsibility entail? For
one thing, and perhaps most import-
antly, it means that this university
must become a focal point of diverse
experience where all members of so-
ciety may come and grow in human
understanding and hopefully com-
passion. This I would imagine is ob-
vious to everyone.

There is something else which
should also be obvious to everyone,
yet it is certainly not in the case
of the student body. What a sub-

 

is a safeguard. They know that they |

the legal authorities.

It became obvious to this year’s
E.C. that something had to be done.
We made a step toward solving the
problem by placing one boy on so-
cial probation and another on con-
duct probation for the continual
cashing of cold checks. These pun-
ishments were not too severe in view
of the number of cold checks passed
by the individuals and the fact that
past E.C.’s have threatened ex-
pulsion from the University for pas-
sage of numerous cold checks. This
year’s Executive Committee debated
the possibility of putting intentional
cold check violators under the honor
system, but never took any decisive
action.

The newly elected E.C. continued

Civil Rights Movement Needed Here

overlook or else still refuse to admit
is the fact that Washington and
Lee’s need for diversity cannot come
about unless Negroes are fully in-
tegrated into our community. As
mentioned above, the Negro’s efforts
to achieve equal status, one of the
great events in the struggle to ele-
vate the dignity of the individual, is
something which Washington and
Lee must not experience vicariously
through second-hand newspaper or
Huntley-Brinkley reports. How
could we possibly have any first
hand involvement or knowledge,
when we are so far removed from
the source and participants of this
human struggle?

Washington and Lee claims to be a
“liberal arts” institution, devoted to
the free interchange of ideas, of
values and of experience. Yet we

the law. It is hoped that by putting
it into being not only intentional
cold checks, but all carelessness re-
sulting in accidental cold checks will
be curtailed. As a result of this, our
relations with the Lexington mer-
chants will be strengthened

But the question is quickly asked,
“What constitutes an intentional
cold check?” It is simply one written
by a student on insufficient funds,
when he knows that he does not have
those funds, and does not either
post-date the check or inform the
person to whom it is written that he
does not have funds. The following
may help to further explain.

Often times a student will write an
accidental cold check. He does not
have the funds to cover the check
even though he thinks he does

By BILL, WILKERSON

This month witnessed the end of
Washington and Lee’s longest com-
petitive season, From early in Sep-
tember at Freshman Camp to a few
short weeks ago, W&L debaters
have participated in twenty-six de-
bate events.

In what Mr. Chaffin, W&L’s debate
coach and Assistant Professor of
English, called his team’s most suc-
cessful season, debaters won 20 tro-
phies, plaques, and cups, and 16 cer-
tificates of merit.

The debate team is also one of
W&L's furtherest traveling teams.
Literally thousands of miles were put
on Mr. Chaffin's little green Peugeot
in trips to Emory University in At-
lanta, to Dartmouth College in New
Hampshire, and to Ohio State in
Columbus, to name a few of the
many tournaments.

Any season as long as this should
be quiet and leisurely; but week-
end after weekend, matches and
large tournaments are held. In de-
bate there are no restrictions to
favor the small schools. At tourna-
ments W&L students compete
against the nation’s best and often
win,

With this vast collection of cups

“land bowls, Mr. Chaffin remarked that

all he needed now were some nuts
and candy to establish himself as
ene of Lexington’s gracious hosts.

Viewing the future in store for
debating at W&L, Mr. Chaffin was
optimistic that next year would see
equal triumphs because of the fact
that all of this year's frontline de-
batera would be returning.

Among this year’s debaters, Mr

performance turned out by freshman
Jim Hamill, a SPE freshman from
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in com-
piling the best won-lost record in
the debate program at Washington
and Lee.

Some of the many people who
have participated in this year’s de-
bate tournaments are Paul Prince,
Kaz Herchold, Dave Marchese, Chris
Mills, Hal Higginbotham, and Tom
Baremore.

But the debate program and trips
should not be in any way interpre-
ted as being mere weekend excur-
sions. The tensions of representing
a college's fame in an intellectual
struggle is just as great as that felt
on the football field in a tie game.

In addition there are the pressures
of travel to and from tournaments in
weather conditions that included
blizzards, checking in and out of
countless hotels, and driving all
night a number of times.

Tomorrow night is the annual de-
bate banquet which is highlighted by
the presentation of several awards
by Mr. Chaffin to the successful de-
baters of the past year. the prizes
to be presented include the Noell-
Eckes Award to be given by Dean
Gilliam to a person selected by Mr.
Chaffin for his service in the field
of intercollegiate debating.

This year began with 87 students
interested in the fleld of debating.
The vast majority of these students
were given the opportunity to par-
ticipate in debates held among W&L
students. From these was gleaned
the few who would represent W&L
at major tournaments.

There is much we need to forget
about what has happened to us at
Washington and Lee. Cruel week-
ends. Sterile classes. Inhuman fel-
lows. We all have a weekend to
erase, a girl we don’t want to re-
member, an unnamed experience to
forget. We will remember the things
that went wrong, the disillusion-
ments, the betrayals.

The ceremony of graduation will
help to make these things seem all
right. Parents will come, confident
all along that their son would get
a fine education at this fine Univer-
sity.

What will we remember on June 3,
as we go through our paces in cap
and grown? We will have forgotten,
already, our dissatisfaction with
Washington and Lee life. The day
will be sunny, our thoughts will be
sunny, A graduate of Washington
and Lee. An educated man. About
to take our places in the proud
and successful ranks of Washington
and Lee alumni. “Be great,” Linwood
Holton told us. We will, every one
of us. Washington and Lee men are
great men.

Today, still in class, still before
exams, we have not yet come to this
feeling of smooth confidence. There
is so much left to do for Washington
and Lee. There are great problems
of education, of discrimination, of
administration. We could have done
so much more to help the Univer-
sity face and solve these problems,
and we could have done so much
more ourselves.

But we didn't. In four years of
college we did little of anything. We
were bored, we were unconcerned,
we were involved.

At graduation, no one will talk
about this. The gloss of graduation
will make us feel that these four
years have been years of growth and
accomplishment. With not much urg-
ing. we will begin to believe.

We will shake hands and be kissed
and be congratulated for our majestic
attainment of a college degree. A
time for joy, a time for celebration,
a time for happy memories of col-
lege days.

These happy memories are now
beginning to come to the surface as
June approaches. Maybe a few things
did go wrong. Perhaps we didn't
learn or do everything the way we
hoped. But these were wonderful
years, weren't they? Weren't they?

The campus is beginning to look
beautiful and dreamlike. We are
beginning to be proud that we have
spent four years in Lexingten at
Washington and Lee. As these days
pass we will more and more develop
an affection for our University.
Graduation will give us a framework
for these ideas and emotions

Soon we will forget the evils, the
injustices, the stupidities we have

are presently failing miserably in our
knowledge and understanding of the
ideas, values and experience of over
ten per cent of America’s population.
Yet we are being almost totally
passed over by a transformation in
American society and morality which
has already, and shall continue to
permeate the very depths of the
American and human experience.
How many of us have ever confront-
ed Negroes of our equal on an in-
tellectual or social level? Gentle-
men, it is no longer sufficient for us
to claim a knowledge and under-
standing of the Negro situation and
efforts because we were raised with
a “Mammy” which we think the
world of, or because we worked with
Negroes in our father’s warehouse
one summer.

And at the same time, it is no
longer possible for this university
to claim a place among the great
universities of this country. We are
a very good university; the fact
that we are so removed from the
mainstream of contemporary exper-
ience (in the sense that we remain
all white) necessarily precludes us
from greatness. Although I am aware
that each year we graduate men
who will become “leaders” in so-
ciety, 1 am more than a little appre-
hensive about the quality and di-
rection of any leadership which is
so detached from a most crucial as-
pect of contemporary experience.

If my analysis is correct, the stu-
dent body breaks down into three
general categories with respect to its
attitude coneerning racial integra-
tion here. There exists, on one ex-
treme, a number of students total
ly opposed to any Negroes whatso-
ever becoming members of this com-
munity. These people most likely
discard anything I have said up to
here, as well as all other arguments
supporting the desireability and the
need for racial integration here (or
anywhere). There also exists, on
the other extreme, a number of stu-
dents like myself, conviced of the
need for diversity through the in-
clusion of Negroes, and determined
to help affect this situation.

A substantial number of | this
group, as myself, also feel that this
entire question is largely one of mor-
ality, and that any efforts to per-
petuate discrimination against any
human being is immoral. Then there
remains what I believe is the larg-
est group of students: those who are
willing, perhaps even desire, to have
integration come about but only
through a natural sequence of events
and without conscious effort on the
part of Washington and Lee to hast-
en the process. Some of this group
no doubt regrets that integration
must take place but accepts its in-
evitability, while others are more
neutral in their attitude. The main
attitude which characterizes this
group is the fact that, willing or
resigned, they don’t believe any
conscious efforts which would facili-
tate or speed up Washington and
Lee’s becoming integrated should be
made. There are several points, di-
rectly relevant to all three attitudes,
which | would like to comment upon.

I do not favor any more than
most others the idea that Washing-
ton and Lee go out and “buy” a
Negro. I do not believe any more
than most that one, or even several
Negroes, will give this university the
diversity it so crucially needs. When
I analyze the situation, I find that
I am as much disturbed and afraid
about the fact that there are no
Negroes here as I am disturbed and
afraid of the type of thought which
could allow, and still allows, this
situation to prevail. I view the ideal
situation not as one where Washing-
ton and Lee would have to bend
over backwards to locate and admit
Negroes, but rather as one where
qualified Negroes would naturally
desire to come here just like any
of us—where our admissions policy
would recruit qualified Negro stu-
dents in exactly the same manner
in which they now recruit qualified
white students. But this is not pres-
ently the case, and there are sev-
eral reasons why this cannot, for
the present, be so.

It is absolutely naive and unreal-
istic for this university to either hope
or believe it can attract qualified
Negro applicants until it first dem-
onstrates not only its willingness,
but also its determination to fully
accept them into the community.
Although one would perhaps cite
the ruling by the board of trustees
to the effect that this university will
not discriminate against any appli-
cant becouse of race as an example
of our willingness to accept Negroes,
I would contend that this is for
from encouraging in the eyes of a
Negro, and that besides there has
been nothing tangible to follow up
this initial effert. Furthermore, the
important distinction is that this de-
cision remains in the realm of

olf Places Third

Golf Third At
St. Louis CAC

Mathews In Second Place
With 150; Fulwider Shoots
Next With A 153

By LEX TARUMIANZ

This past weekend the Washington
and Lee golf team traveled to St.
Louis for the annual Spring Sports
Festival at Washington University.
The team finished third in team
standings with a four-man total of
615, ten strokes behind second-place
Washington University.

Sewanee captured both team hon-
ors and individual honors, as John
Capers of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania,
won the individual title.

Bobby Mathews

Washington and Lee Freshman
Bobby Mathews finished in a tie for
second place with a 150 total. He
shot 72 in the first round and led
going into the second round by two
strokes. He shot a 78 in the second
round. His 72 on Friday was the best
turned in by a W&L player. His
two-over-par 72 was shot on a wet
course which was playing quite long.
Tied for second with Mathews were
Charlie Sanders of Centre and Billy
Nayner of Sewanee.

Jim Fulwider recorded the second
best score for Washington and Lee
with a total of 153 for 36 holes. Spen-
cer Sullivan shot a 155 and Captain
Ed Crosland shot 157 to complete
W&L’sfour man team.

Washington and Lee completed
the season a with 4-3 record and a

third place in the C.A.C.

 

Spring Soccer

Sunday afternoon on Wilson Field
the Varsity and Freshmen soccer
team defeated the Alumni, 3-2.

The returning Alumni team con-
sisted of Dave Redman, Bruce Jack-
son, Tim Henry, West Horner, and
Dave Kirkpatrick. The rest of the
team was made up from law stu-
dents.

Scoring two goals for the Varsity
was Scott Fechney. The other goal
was made by Captain Fred Skinner.
The goals for the Alumni were scor-
ed by West Horner and Tim Henry.

The purpose of the spring soccer
match was to ascertain the potential
strengths and weaknesses of next
year’s team. As a result, it was found
that there will be five very difficult
positions to fill, places left empty
by graduating seniors.

The score of the game was un-
usually close, Coach Lyles announc-
ed, because the team had had only
three or four days to practice, as
opposed to the two weeks spring
practice last year.

Coach Lyles announced that soccer
practice would begin next fall on

Track Goes To Conference

Field Events Prove Downfall

By JOHN THIEMEYER

The Washington and Lee track
team flew to St. Louis over the
weekend to go up against the four
other teams comprising the College
Athletic Conference. Action was lim-
ited on the first day by foul weath-
er but on Saturday competition
finally got underway.

Buck Mynttinen

W&L showed good strength in the
distance races, but weaknesses in
the field events proved to be the
team’s demise. In fact, the only
bright spot in the field events was
a second place by SPE Senior Buck
Mynttinen. Other seniors shared the
spotlight as Lee Johnson got a sec-
ond in the two-mile run with a time
of 10:02.6, followed by Ralph
O’Connor with a 10:20.2 and a third
place, and finally Jim Thompson
who ran a 50.9 second quarter for a
fourth place.

Backing up these seniors were sev-
eral promising freshmen. Of partic-
ular note were Ralph Pearcy in the
mile, Dave Ennis in the 120 yd. high
hurdles and the three freshmen on
the fourth-place 440-yd. relay team.

Bob Stack continued his excel-
lent running with a 4:313 in the
mile which was good for a third
place. He was backed up by Pearcy,
who got a fourth place with a 4:39.8.

440-yd. Relay

The 440-yd. relay team consisting
of Freshman Norwood, Price, Hinkle,
and Sophomore Horne, took fourth
place with 449 seconds. The other
relay team turned in a 3:32 mile
time which was good for a fifth
place.

Though eclipsed in the interme-
diate hurdles, Washington and Lee
came through in the 120-yd. high
hurdles with a third and a fifth
place by Freshman Ennis and Junior
Jeff Kugel respectively. Ennis ran
this race in 16.4 seconds, four tenths
of a second ahead of Kugel.

Undoubtedly, Washington and Lee
will be substantially hurt by the
loss of seniors Jim Thompson, and
Rick Mynttinen, Ralph O’Connor,
and Lee Johnson. Each of these four
has accumulated a very impressive
number of points while at W&L.
Fortunately, boosted by strong fresh-
man support in all areas, the team
stands a very good chance of mov-
ing ahead in the next few years.

 

W@L Baseball Team
Loses to Sewanee,

Centre, At CAC

By JOHN THIEMEYER

The baseball team closed the year
with mixed emotions Saturday when
they were blanked by the C.A.C.
competition at Washington Univer-
sity. Forced by a Friday rainstorm
to play a doubleheader on Saturday
morning, the team lost first to
Centre, 9-3, and then a little more
than an hour later to the Sewanee
team, 7-1.

The Sewanee game was the last
at Washington and Lee for two out-
standing Seniors. Dave Kirkpatrick
at shortstop and Eric Sisler at sec-
ond base provided successful hitting
and fielding throughout their tenure
here.

In the way of future developments,
there are a number of freshman
hopefuls, in particular, center fielder
Tom Mitchell and catcher John
Wolfe. Mitchell provided two triples.
The pitching of Sophomore Bill Ras-
mussen and Junior Pete Heumann
looked really good.

Hampered by abnormally bad
weather this season, the team posted
a 3-7 record including the C.A.C,
tournament games. Next year, how-
ever, will possibly feature more
games scheduled for earlier in the
season, and perhaps a spring trip

 

down South.

Coach Canfield Reveals Basketball
Prospects For Next Year’s Team

By DAVE SCHWENDEMAN

When all-state basketball star Mel
Cartwright decided to come to W&L
everyone realized that the Gener-
als basketball program is moving
forward. What people fail to under-
stand is all the work Coach Verne
Canfield, his staff, and his players
have done to start the rebuilding
process.

Canfield has been fighting for
Cartwright since Mel's junior year.
“Getting a boy like Mel is hard
work,” said the coach. “VPI, Georgia
Tech, UVa. West Point, and others
were all offering Mel full scholar-
ships.”

“We were able tosell him on our
fine academic standing, the small
school atmosphere, and the lack of
big-time basketball pressure. At
W&L Mel will get no aid other than
that awarded him through the Rob-
ert E. Lee Scholarship he earned
by being a good student.”

Cartwright is not the only pros-
pect in the class of 1970. Canfield
predicts, “Next year’s freshmen will
be the best group of basketball play-
ers ever to enter W&L. What's more,
they are fine boys and the type of
gentlemen we want here.”

These prospects include: Mel Wes-

burg; Rick Armstrong, Western
Carolina all-star with a 31 point
per game average; Gary Murphy, a
defensive specialist; Ben Baden, Mid-
All-State in Alabama; and Dave

Canfield believes, “these boys are
all bonafide prospects. I expect
Cartwright and Wesselink to play a

Rugby Defeats UVa.
Cavaliers Scoreless

Sunday afternoon at 4 p.m. the
Washington and Lee rugby team de-
feated University of Virginia, 15-0, at
Charlottesville.

Touchdowns were scored’ by
Tersch Baker and Bob Priddy. All
the conversions were successful at-
tempted by Doug Allen. Throughout
the entire game the UVa. squad had
only one advance beyond their own
50-yard line.

After the game UVa. hosted free

afternoon, 3 p.m.
at Wilson Field
the Southern Sem-

Team will give its
final show of the
year. We've

that institution.
Who of us studs

Anyway, we're finally going to see
the entire equestrian team riding to-
gether. Heading the team will be
the captain, that queen of the saddle,
Mary Ann Trots. The girls will ex-
hibit their outstanding talents for
animal-handling and precision move-
ments.

Asked in an interview how their
horses would be transported to Lex-
ington for the gala event, Many Ann
replied simply, “We'll ride in.”

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Mindel Discusses Negro Attitude

(Continued from page 2)
“willingness”; I would challenge any-
one to cite evidence of our “determi-
nation” to accept Negroes into our
ranks. As was pointed out in a re-
cent Ring-tum Phi editorial, there is
indeed little incentive for a qualified
Negro to really want to attend Wash-
ington and Lee. Not only have we,
individually and collectively, failed
to express our determination to ful-
ly accept him as an integral part
of the community, but also must we
point to a long history of prejudice,
a fraternity system which allows
both implicit and explicit racial dis-
crimination, and all white student
body and faculty, and an amazing
indifference to the ideals, values
and events which characterize Negro
life today.

This situation is rendered all the
more despicable because of the fact
that we students ourselves (and fac-
ulty) can actually do more towards
making Washington and Lee more
attractive to qualified Negroes than
the trustees, administration or any-
one else ever do. For it is only our-
selves who have the power to force-
fully demonstrate to everyone, white
and Negro alike, our determination
to achieve a truly diversified com-
munity. This is the idea behind the
fund which has been established for
the furtherance of any aspect of
the actual racial integration process
here; it is hoped that students will
voluntarily contribute to this fund.

tions passed by the Executive Com-
mittee; it is hoped that students will
actively encourage qualified Negroes
to apply for admission.

These then, are some of the prob-
lems and choices which confront
Washington and Lee in its attempt
to achieve a more diversified uni-
versity.

The obvious question is what can
and must we as students do to be
the greatest aid to Washington and
Lee in its effort to progress with
the rest of society. It must be empha-
sized that one’s “willingness” to ac-
cept or achieve a truly integrated
community means precisely noth-
ing—if this is not accompanied by
an expression of one’s “determina-
tion,” to do so. It is about time the
student body came down from their
“splendid isolation” and made a com-
mitment on this matter. One of our
Contact speakers told us to our faces
that Washington and Lee was suf-
fering from a “pernicious anemia”
in that we were all white; to this
charge, 1 would add that we are suf-
fering from another “pernicious
anemia” besides the fact that we are
all white: namely, that we even re-
fuse to honestly and responsibly take
a stand which we are willing to
support through action. It requires
little courage to retain a “benign
and neutral silence” on an issue,
yet it also requires little insight to
see that this issue could very weil
become Washington and Lee’s nem-

 

This is the idea behind the resolu-

esis.

(Continued from page 2)

through an error in bookkeeping,
etc. This would not be considered
an honor violation.

Many students now commonly use
the practice of post-dating a check.
This is done when a student needs
money but has none in the bank.
He writes the check, but makes an
agreement with the merchant to put
not the present date, but a future
date on the check. The understand-
ing is that by the time the check
falls due, the student will have added
enough to his account to cover the
amount of the check. The merchant
does not try to collect on that check
until the agreed date arrives. Under
the new law, this would not be
considered an honor violation, either.

There is always the possibility that
a boy will cash a check with the
expectation of receiving money from
home later in the day. He intends
to deposit this money upon its ar-
rival. But what if the expected mon-
ey does not come and the merchant
goes to the Cold Check Committee?
Would this be an honor violation.
No, not if the boy could prove that
he had reason to expect the funds.

 

Nash Says Cold Checks Violation

The safest way to avoid this type
of situation, however, is to post-date
the check or make sure the mer-
chants understands you are expect-
ing funds.

Suspicion of intentional passing of
cold checks will be reported by the
Cold Check Committee to the Execu-
tive Committee. Also, students with
information concerning the inten-
tional passing of cold checks are
obligated to report it to the E.C. just
as they would cheating on a test. The
reports to the Executive Committee
will set in motion an investigation
and a possible trial just as any other
suspected honor violations would do.

It is important to keep entirely
clear that the passing of a cold check
is not an honor violation. It is the
intentional passing of a cold check
that falls under the honor system.

It is the feeling of the 1966-67
Executive committee that the inten-
tional cashing of a cold check is
dishonorable and it will be consider-
ed an honor system violation. It is
the E.C.’s hope that every W&L stu-
dent will refrain from the intentional
passing of cold checks just as he
would refrain from plagiarism or
cheating on a test.

CAMPUS
FASHIONS

By CHIP TOLBERT
ESQUIRE’S FASHION EDITOR

SUMMER STANDS POISED on the edge of campus, ready to rush

in and fill the void as classes, exams, and term papers come to their
appointed ends. For Summer ’66, your wardrobe will accent the
colorful and the casual. Here are a few pointers on what to take
along when you split the academic scene,

BASKETBALL BEACHWEAR? why not? We

already have the classic “boxer” short. This
season one important swimwear trend derives
from the basketball courts. The style is moder-
ately trim-fitting, and its trademark is side
vents. New sport-oriented color combinations
take precedence: look for white cotton trunks with navy binding
down the sides and around the legs; navy trunks with beige trim,
and maroon trunks with navy bindings.

 

“BY THE SEA, BY THE SEA, by the beautiful sea...” Do you re-

call those colorful cardboard plaques with a cut-out hole to pop
your head through to be photographed in a legitimate 1890's beach
scene? Do you remember the hilarious beachwear fashions of our
Victorian grandfathers? Well, modified versions of the same are
back, and for sheer fun in the sun, they’re unbeatable. Look for
bold, striped, stretch cotton knit outfits. Shirts feature a Henley
neck, while the usually matching stretch swim trunks reach half-
way to your knees, Bold belt treatments, adjustable side tabs, and
fully-lined shorts are all part of this “new” fashion. “Dipping,
anyone?”

BELTED BRIEFS, bold colors, and trim lines

cut from stretch fabrics may be more to the
typical college man’s taste. Husky brass and
silver buckles complement broader belts. Colors
) are hot and bright: vivid blue-green blends,
vibrant reds, yellows and oranges, and an end-
less variety of stripe and border treatments.

 

C.P.0.’S FOR SUMMER. The chier Petty Officer shirt, along with

bell bottoms and the classic Navy pea jacket, are three major
fashion contributions of your local Army Navy store, The pea
jacket is reserved for winter wear (though its double-breasted
idea carries over in many of this summer’s colorful blazers). Bell-
bottoms are already a summer staple, and this season will see the
C.P.0. shirt introduced for warm weather wear. Chief C.P.0,

At the last regular meeting of

Most significant of the new chang-
es increases the cost of the dance

Cox noted that although this might
seem extravagant at first, the rising
cost of entertainment and the gen-

‘Want to visit Russia?”

 

Capito Attends Russian Youth Camp |

When Washington and Lee’s stu-
dents seatter in a hundred directions
with the close of school one will head
for a Russian Youth Camp.

Howard Capito, a sophomore from
Charleston, W. Va., will spend sev-
eral days at the camp as part of a
three-week tour of the Soviet Union
and some of its satellite countries.

Study in Munich

Capito, along with 40 other col-
lege students from the US. and
Canada, will study this summer in
Munich, Germany, in the Soviet
Area and Language Session spon-
sored by the University of Oklaho-
ma in cooperation with the Institute
for the Study of the USSR.

After the six-weeks course at
Munich, Capito and his fellow stu-
dents will tour Russia, Czechoslo-

 

vakia, Poland and East and West

| Berlin.

At Kiev, in the Soviet Union, they
will stay at the youth camp.

“I don’t know much about the
camp except that we will be joined
by a group of Soviet students on
our tour, and they will be with us at
the camp,” Capito said. “I expect
on our tour we will see only what
the Russians want us to see.”

Other stops on the tour include
Leningrad, Prague and Warsaw.

History and Literature

The Soviet Studies program offers
courses in Soviet literature, history
and language as well as opportuni-
ties for research and advanced area
study. Although scholarships for the
program are available, Capito is one
of those paying his own way.

CONTACT Narrows 1967 Topic
And Requests Tax-Free Status

CONTACT for 1967, under the di-
rection of Stafford W. Keegin, Law
School ’68, Chairman, and W. Law-
rence Fellman, ’67, Assistant Chair-
man, will examine some of the rev-
olutionary forces caused by the ris-
ing expectations and discontinuity
produced by a new affluency wit-
ness not only by the citizens of the
United States, but the world com-
munity as well.

The scope of the program will be
broad bringing into focus some of
the new hopes and the disintergra-
tion of old patterns in the churches,
education and the college campus,
public morality, politics, both do-
mestic and foreign, the arts and the
business community.

The first business of the new CON-
TACT Committee, however, was far
more basic than the determination

 

cause the students are the sponsors
of the program and, of course, no
admission is charged for partici-
pation in the seminar lectures, and
because the CONTACT program for
1966 failed to break even financially,
the committee set out to revamp its
internal structure in order to be in
compliance with the Internal Rev-
enue Code on non-profit associa-
tions thereby making all contribu-
tions by interested parties tax de-
ductible.

While the committee has not, as of
this writing received a ruling from
IRS, they do not anticipate difficulty
in this regard. Because of the over-
whelming support of CONTACT on
the campus and off, the committee
is confident that the financial diffi-
culties it now faces can be over-
come and that CONTACT for 1967
will be as exciting an intellectual

of a topic for the 1967 program. Be- | experience as it has been in the past.

A Message to the New Students

The traditions of Washington and Lee University require conven-
tional dress. Our shop, in keeping with these traditions, is designed
solely for the W&L man and features the natural
shoulder style prevailing on our campus.

The correct appearance of both “on and off” campus is so very im-
portant throughout the school year .. .

AND YOU CERTAINLY WANT TO LOOK YOUR BEST
DURING RUSH WEEK.

Our long experience with W&L men enables us to soundly advise
and fill all your complete clothing requirements in the beginning
and throughout the school year.

You, as a student of W&L, hold the priviledge of an open charge ac-

count, either billed direct to you or to your home, or both, whatever

the case may be. We hope you will make use of this and our many
other services.

 

We cordially invite your correspondence on particular apparel prob-

Johnson, Andrews Top Athletes;
Awards and Barbecue End Year

Ira L. Johnson and William D. An-
drews received Washington and Lee
University’s top two athletic awards
last week at the school’s annual
sports awards barbecue.

Johnson, a senior from Louisville,
Ky., was presented the Wink Glas-
gow Spirit and Sportsmanship
Award, given to the athlete who has
demonstrated the highest qualities of
W&L spirit and sportsmanship
throughout his college career.

Billy Andrews

Andrews, a senior from Salem, was
named the most valuable athlete.
The award is presented for perform-
ance and proficiency in W&L athlet-
ics.

Johnson has been a member of the
Generals’ cross-country team three
years and the track squad four
years and has earned a total of sev-
en monograms during that span. He
co-captained each sport this past
year.

In addition, he set a new W&L
cross-country record this past fall,
covering the 4.1 mile-long course
in 23:40.

Andrews, a defensive halfback in
football and mid-fielder in lacrosse,
has been a three-year letterman on
each team and, like Johnson, co-
captained each sport this year.
